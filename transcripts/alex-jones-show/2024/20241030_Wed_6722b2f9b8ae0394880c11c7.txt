[00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.950]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.390]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.510]  It is Wednesday, October 30th, 2024.
[00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.250]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.869]  Well, if you aren't on the edge of your seat...
[00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:48.689]  And if you're not out there taking action politically to wake folks up and spiritually to warn them about the fight between good versus evil, you ain't awake.
[00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.929]  Five days, 14 hours, 59 minutes, 30 seconds.
[00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.329]  Woo!
[00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:57.770]  I'm telling you.
[00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.009]  All right.
[00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.609]  It's very paradoxical, as I've been saying, best of times, worst of times.
[00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.390]  All over the world, not just here, globalists are being...
[00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:10.670]  Totally exposed.
[00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:13.230]  Everything is turning to crap they touch.
[00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.870]  The whole world's turning against them.
[00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.709]  God is moving through the people.
[00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.189]  Whistleblowers are just pouring out intel everywhere.
[00:01:21.269 --> 00:01:23.549]  But then, I've got half a brain.
[00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:31.469]  What's super evil do when it's got all the stolen money and the political power and the mechanisms and the machinery when it's cornered?
[00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.230]  It creates crises.
[00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.930]  It does cyber attacks.
[00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.810]  It starts wars.
[00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.670]  It stages terror attacks and blames it on us.
[00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.390]  So yeah, I am...
[00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:43.340]  So torn.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.219]  And normally, you know, we're through these longer periods of politics and systems.
[00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:57.640]  It's been a long, hard march to warn people and expose the globalists and even get people to be aware of the New World Order, global government, anti-human, depopulation, death cult.
[00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:58.799]  But now we're there.
[00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.579]  I mean, it's the hottest thing and it ain't going away.
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.700]  And people are discovering the imprisonment grid being built around them.
[00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.400]  So everything's accelerating, but also the evil's accelerating.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.639]  And so on one side, I'm like, man, we're so blessed.
[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.400]  Thank you, God.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.560]  This is incredible.
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:30.259]  And then I'm like, oh my god, the enemy's moving on every front to just activate all these foreign terror sleeper cells, blow everything up, blame it on Trump supporters.
[00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:31.719]  I mean, they're just all over the news.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.979]  The number one terror threat is Trump supporters.
[00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:35.879]  They're going to kill the minorities any minute.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.479]  And people are like, that's dumb.
[00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:38.639]  None of that's happening.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.000]  Oh, they're going to provide it.
[00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:41.599]  Obviously.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.659]  You'd have to be at 50 IQ not to understand that.
[00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:56.969]  And there's that, and then it comes out that Tim Walz is now an official communist Chinese agent, and then Biden comes out and says, yeah, I'll tell you, the only garbage around here are Trump supporters.
[00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.009]  It's at least half the public, not just majority of voters.
[00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.030]  Most folks are closeted Trump supporters.
[00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.770]  That's all coming out.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.139]  Hell, I'd say 70% of people support Trump.
[00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.199]  I mean, the election's not close, folks.
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.099]  California's not Democrat.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.259]  New York's not Democrat.
[00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:13.419]  It's election fraud.
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.280]  Anybody that knows, knows.
[00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:17.139]  And they're getting ready to try to steal Texas.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.240]  Is everybody thinking we're about to win?
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.759]  We should, unless they flip Texas.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.560]  42.
[00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:28.990]  In the Electoral College.
[00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.330]  Second only to California.
[00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.050]  We are screwed, blued, and tattooed.
[00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.270]  And they've been really licking their lips and hanging around and winking, winking.
[00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.509]  But we're worried about these battleground states.
[00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.590]  They steal Texas, which they came close to the last two times.
[00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:43.050]  Dangerously close.
[00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.969]  And I talk to the average good old boys I know out there.
[00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.030]  And I'm just like, okay.
[00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.210]  You're in your little town, which is great.
[00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.229]  I wish I was in a little town.
[00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:57.099]  And you're insulated by being around normal people.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.780]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.199]  You've been to a city?
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.080]  Yeah.
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.919]  The left is invading.
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.419]  They might as well be parachuting in.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.300]  So, hope and pray that they don't steal Texas because they're sure as hell trying.
[00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:20.459]  But barring something like that, before they kill 45 the next five days, they can't override this.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.839]  It's too big to rig.
[00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.910]  And then you just add the cherry on top, the icing on the cake.
[00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:32.990]  Tony Hitchcliffe, good friend of mine, so funny, roast everybody.
[00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.910]  They take a comment out of context.
[00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:39.730]  He attacked black people, white people, Hispanics, Jews, made jokes about everybody.
[00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:41.870]  That's the point of going to a roast.
[00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.810]  He's hilarious.
[00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.410]  Number one comedy thing in the last year was him at that Tom Brady thing, remember?
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.720]  But now Biden officially came out and called all Trump supporters garbage.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.100]  This is huge.
[00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:01.620]  And then they've caught what's clearly illegal aliens voting in Pennsylvania and just all the fraud.
[00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:02.620]  We're catching them red-handed.
[00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:03.819]  It is crazy.
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.639]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now.
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.160]  Share the links.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.720]  Relox Jones on X. The live feed.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.180]  Let's get 50 million viewers today.
[00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:16.259]  The epicness of the moment we are now in in history is incredible.
[00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.060]  I can feel it.
[00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.910]  The rising energy of humanity reaching for the stars.
[00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.589]  Our ancestors' hard work in sending their spirit forward into the future is now with us.
[00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:50.870]  And the light of God's truth like wind in our sails powering us ever forward into discovery, exploration, and the challenges of free will and unlimited consciousness.
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.439]  It is Wednesday, October 30th, 2024.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:04.139]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and this is the tip of the spear in the fight for team humanity.
[00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:06.899]  You have found it!
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.620]  Now share it.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.199]  You have the power.
[00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.819]  I suggest you use it.
[00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:24.730]  Want to be trampled by the scum that are inferior and know they are so they seek power because they do not have power!
[00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.350]  They have no power!
[00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.189]  They have no soul!
[00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:32.529]  They have no will!
[00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.730]  They have no destiny!
[00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.029]  Oh!
[00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:53.620]  I've been working a long time for what we're beginning to see.
[00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:59.660]  And we are not at the beginning of the fight against tyranny.
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.980]  We are not in the middle of the fight against tyranny.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:10.060]  We are in the beginning of the end of this manifestation of tyranny.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.040]  But it's been said a trillion different ways because it's so true.
[00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:18.990]  Hard times make strong men.
[00:07:19.209 --> 00:07:21.110]  Strong men make good times.
[00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.870]  Good times make weak men.
[00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:24.649]  Weak men make bad times.
[00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.769]  And so the circle is complete.
[00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.310]  And it happens over and over again in our species.
[00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:36.089]  The more things change, the more they stay the same.
[00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:49.490]  That said, we now have nuclear weapons, biological weapons, and all of this insanity, and you add that into this, this is the real challenge that we are facing right now.
[00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.009]  All right.
[00:07:51.829 --> 00:07:53.350]  Every day just gets more intense.
[00:07:53.529 --> 00:07:54.370]  I mean, I said this a week ago.
[00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:56.290]  I said this is the most important broadcast I've ever done.
[00:07:56.449 --> 00:07:58.310]  This is the most insane news I've ever covered.
[00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.389]  And because of the quickening's here, I guarantee you tomorrow will be more insane, and the next day, and the next day.
[00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:03.490]  And it's just happening.
[00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:04.850]  And you better believe...
[00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.689]  It's gonna get more insane on November 5th, next Tuesday.
[00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.310]  The Democrats have promised to not accept a Trump win.
[00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.910]  They have promised to supply whatever amount of ballots after the fact to steal it.
[00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:23.069]  They have promised, even if we overpower that, to not certify in Congress.
[00:08:24.329 --> 00:08:27.029]  They have promised armed rebellion.
[00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.790]  They have promised civil war conditions.
[00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:43.509]  And they have spewed lies so cartoonish, so over the top, so ridiculous, that even with people that have been asleep, they have become a total laughingstock.
[00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.529]  We have forced these loonies out in the open.
[00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:59.269]  So, let me just tell you what's in the news, and I'm going to judiciously get into it.
[00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.490]  Because I'm on a nice edge here.
[00:09:02.549 --> 00:09:06.750]  I can be super positive because things are going so well, but there's also incredible danger.
[00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.250]  It's Newtonian physics, like Dale Bigtree said two days ago in studio.
[00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.009]  I was about to say, for every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:15.210]  He starts saying it.
[00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.669]  I'm about to say the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.570]  In no connotation of that, he starts saying it.
[00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:23.610]  It happened five times.
[00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:26.470]  Well, it happened a few times and I wasn't noticing.
[00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.049]  I said, is he finishing my sentences?
[00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.889]  And then by the end of the two-hour interview, I was literally...
[00:09:31.889 --> 00:09:34.490]  This was not that we're reading from some script.
[00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.029]  We were simpatico.
[00:09:37.129 --> 00:09:38.830]  We had a telekinesis connection.
[00:09:38.909 --> 00:09:39.750]  No doubt.
[00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.750]  No doubt.
[00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.289]  And that's when you know you're in the center of the war.
[00:09:47.769 --> 00:09:49.970]  When that stuff completely flips on.
[00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:51.950]  Because you're in the spirit.
[00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.049]  Finishing each other's sentences.
[00:09:55.549 --> 00:09:57.830]  That's what this is all about, baby.
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:12.120]  But by the end of the interview, I would just not even say, I was sitting there going, I was going to say this, and I'd go, what the hell is going on here?
[00:10:13.139 --> 00:10:14.519]  That's the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.539]  You think just the devil gives his little minions some powers, some gifts?
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.799]  We've got the real gifts of the Spirit.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.600]  Let me stop.
[00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:36.889]  They really seem to be focusing with a sneak attack on Texas to try to steal it.
[00:10:37.409 --> 00:10:40.210]  That could be the big game changer.
[00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:47.710]  But their plan B is stealing Pennsylvania.
[00:10:48.669 --> 00:10:50.610]  And so I tried to go through the litany.
[00:10:50.909 --> 00:11:04.139]  Most of you already know all about it, but for folks that don't know, One county a month ago found thousands of fake registrations to put people on the names.
[00:11:05.019 --> 00:11:07.759]  And then a bunch of counties checked it and they found the same thing.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.980]  And then the database got hacked and taken down last Friday.
[00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:12.139]  Last time I heard it's still down.
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:19.139]  And then not just one video, but more of buses pulling up with what looks like people from, they look Guatemalan.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.080]  And they're being led up by the bureaucrat Soros funded group.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:35.500]  You look up the group, and the voting officials come out to meet them, cut off the huge lines of people that are clearly citizens, black, white, Hispanic, or Americans, and march them in to vote.
[00:11:35.639 --> 00:11:38.200]  And then they're like, oh, the name doesn't match.
[00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:41.460]  And then the lady goes, it's okay, go back and find your real name.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.580]  Because they're coming to vote in a name.
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:44.840]  And I don't even blame the illegals.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:45.379]  They don't know.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.000]  They're brought in.
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:46.720]  They're giving phones.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.440]  They're giving money.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.279]  They're told, hey, you're allowed to vote.
[00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:51.600]  Obama said illegals can vote.
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.360]  A bunch of states have them openly voting.
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.500]  The federal courts have ruled illegals can vote.
[00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:59.840]  In 10 states I know of, the Supreme Court shot it down in Virginia today.
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.059]  So will that now happen in the other states?
[00:12:03.059 --> 00:12:03.740]  Is it too late?
[00:12:04.659 --> 00:12:07.580]  But we forced them out to admit illegals are voting, even in Texas.
[00:12:11.289 --> 00:12:15.409]  And then their voter registration names don't even match.
[00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:22.029]  And the voter administration lady's like, oh, according to witnesses, you just go back and find your real name.
[00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:22.929]  Winky, winky.
[00:12:24.409 --> 00:12:25.409]  The people don't know.
[00:12:25.529 --> 00:12:28.450]  They're just being led up as a body to do it.
[00:12:29.029 --> 00:12:34.889]  With the registrations that they didn't catch, where they were filled out in fraudulent names that were mailed out.
[00:12:35.029 --> 00:12:36.009]  We know that happened.
[00:12:36.169 --> 00:12:37.029]  They caught them red-handed.
[00:12:39.019 --> 00:12:43.639]  And it's the same crap in Georgia, the same stuff in Arizona, the same stuff in Michigan.
[00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:44.620]  They're catching them everywhere.
[00:12:45.779 --> 00:12:48.860]  But at least people aren't blind this time like four years ago.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.500]  So that's a real train wreck.
[00:12:53.659 --> 00:13:02.220]  And then you've got videos in Pennsylvania again of some guy coming in with an out-of-state plates from Rhode Island with a big box of ballots to go in.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.600]  Is that how you vote?
[00:13:03.659 --> 00:13:05.039]  You just show up with a box to go in?
[00:13:06.809 --> 00:13:09.470]  And he goes in and says, oh, I'm here with the vote.
[00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:10.529]  I've got all these ballots.
[00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:19.850]  And my brother-in-law saw this two days after the 2020 election at the main post office on Congress Street.
[00:13:20.009 --> 00:13:23.889]  There was a guy there taking photos of each one, signing fake names to it in front of him.
[00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.049]  So this is going on an industrial scale.
[00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:31.590]  So we got all that.
[00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.210]  And then, of course, you got Biden calling...
[00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:39.169]  MAGA supporters, half the country, garbage.
[00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:47.730]  In another clip, he says he'd like to take a swim with Trump out in the ocean.
[00:13:47.889 --> 00:13:49.090]  That's like a mafia threat.
[00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.610]  Kamala responded and said she doesn't agree.
[00:13:53.809 --> 00:13:54.049]  No, no.
[00:13:54.529 --> 00:13:57.789]  The globalists don't just see conservatives or Christians or populists as garbage.
[00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:58.909]  They see everybody as garbage.
[00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.309]  Look what they do to the blue cities.
[00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:13.340]  So, This isn't Tony Hinchcliffe, a super well-known Austin-based comedian who I've been on the show many times as live events.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.259]  Kill Tony.
[00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:16.779]  Hinchcliffe.
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.820]  Who's known for roasting everybody and being politically incorrect.
[00:14:20.919 --> 00:14:22.320]  And they take a little snippet out of the thing.
[00:14:22.379 --> 00:14:23.480]  Oh, look, he's attacking Hispanics.
[00:14:23.659 --> 00:14:28.980]  He made jokes about white people, black people, Jews, Hispanics, everybody.
[00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:29.960]  It's what he does.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:30.659]  Everybody loves it.
[00:14:34.019 --> 00:14:37.419]  And he tells a short black guy, man, you're so short.
[00:14:37.559 --> 00:14:41.159]  I guess, you know, your ancestors called picking cotton deadlifts.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.279]  I mean, that's funny.
[00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:44.799]  And it takes a bad subject and makes it funny.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.019]  You know, he says, oh, this guy's Jewish.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.360]  Yeah, he loves football because he wants to watch the Toynkos.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.720]  And then he, you know, calls hillbillies, you know, names.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.720]  I mean, it's just whatever.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.740]  That's the point of it.
[00:14:56.759 --> 00:14:59.480]  And they try to say, oh, my God, see, it was a Nazi rally.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.740]  And of course that backfires.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.000]  And then Biden's like, no, you're just all garbage.
[00:15:05.419 --> 00:15:07.159]  That's way beyond the deplorable thing.
[00:15:07.159 --> 00:15:09.559]  And he's saying what he really thinks.
[00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:10.320]  So we've got that.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.759]  That's why I put the headline up on X right before we went live.
[00:15:13.919 --> 00:15:14.639]  I hope you share the link.
[00:15:14.759 --> 00:15:17.899]  That's why it's going super viral, reaching millions and millions and millions of extra people a day.
[00:15:18.299 --> 00:15:24.879]  When you decide to send it out on your X and your post and on your email and your text messages, hey, the forbidden show's on air right now covering all the different angles.
[00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:26.000]  They don't want you to hear.
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.120]  You find the clips of the show, everything as well.
[00:15:28.179 --> 00:15:35.000]  If you don't have time to watch the whole thing or a big part of it, just find the excerpts of the broadcast on every subject you can imagine.
[00:15:35.299 --> 00:15:35.879]  Every day.
[00:15:36.379 --> 00:15:37.159]  Hundreds of clips.
[00:15:38.179 --> 00:15:41.750]  At Real Alex Jones on X. That's how we win this war.
[00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:42.730]  It's an info war.
[00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.250]  And we're not fighting an uphill battle like decades ago.
[00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:49.269]  People are ready for the truth right now.
[00:15:49.909 --> 00:15:51.549]  Democrat election catastrophe.
[00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:58.370]  Biden's garbage comment has officially put the final nail in the disastrous Harris-Walls campaign.
[00:15:58.649 --> 00:16:01.330]  Must watch, share, live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:07.429]  And of course, by the end of the show, there'll probably be 5 million people watching that one stream.
[00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:08.490]  We've got a whole bunch of streams.
[00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.009]  Some days, we've been hitting 50 million.
[00:16:13.049 --> 00:16:13.769]  Just there.
[00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:27.389]  Not to mention, all over talk radio, all over cable TV, all over systems, number one on cloud TV. Huge streams at infowars.com forward slash show, band out video.
[00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:31.809]  Eclipse, 30-40 million views a day conservatively.
[00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:33.169]  Badass job listeners.
[00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.049]  You're really kicking ass.
[00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.570]  You're really in the arena in the info war.
[00:16:39.809 --> 00:16:41.529]  Boy, info war is talked about everywhere.
[00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:43.549]  Information war by the Democrats, Republicans.
[00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:44.529]  It's the word now.
[00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.230]  Where did I hear of that before?
[00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.509]  Who popularized that?
[00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:48.190]  I don't know.
[00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:52.970]  But we ought to find out who has that show and we might want to listen to it.
[00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:55.690]  Might know a thing or two about what's going on.
[00:16:56.919 --> 00:16:57.779]  But I'll say this.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:05.440]  I know that our regular audience, which is normally about 90% of folks tuning in right now, it's like half because we're just reaching so many people, which is what this is all about.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.119]  Remember, the show ain't for me and not for you because you're awake.
[00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:13.799]  Though you learned something, I learned something from you, but still we know the general stuff.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.579]  We're here to reach the new people.
[00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:18.859]  They don't know Bill Gates.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.539]  Foundation's really called the Population Control Foundation.
[00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:26.119]  They don't know he's pledged to put chemicals in shots that he populate you.
[00:17:26.279 --> 00:17:26.900]  He has.
[00:17:27.259 --> 00:17:30.740]  They don't know how bad stuff is, so we need to tell them.
[00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:31.660]  But they're finally listening.
[00:17:31.799 --> 00:17:33.559]  They're finally going, okay, let me check this out.
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.299]  And that's what victory looks like.
[00:17:36.339 --> 00:17:38.039]  We can't be like, well, these people don't know everything.
[00:17:38.839 --> 00:17:41.519]  Well, weren't you at that point sometime in your life?
[00:17:43.619 --> 00:17:45.380]  I mean, look, I've been on here 30-plus years.
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.579]  I thought I knew a lot back then.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.099]  I know how much I don't know today.
[00:17:49.329 --> 00:17:51.549]  And I grew up around people that knew a lot.
[00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:52.730]  Boy, I sure had a leg up.
[00:17:55.009 --> 00:17:56.529]  People ask how I was on the air at 20.
[00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:57.430]  I'm 50 now.
[00:17:58.829 --> 00:18:07.309]  People find shows, I mean, 94, 95, talking about the New World Order and global government and forced injections and how they'll use a virus to lock down the planet.
[00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.049]  They go, how the hell did this guy know it?
[00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.410]  It's in their documents.
[00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:18.910]  And I've got some documents for you today.
[00:18:20.509 --> 00:18:21.470]  FBI documents.
[00:18:22.289 --> 00:18:29.950]  And we've got Dale Comstock, one of the most famous Delta Force leaders, on with us.
[00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:31.029]  Very interesting fellow.
[00:18:31.329 --> 00:18:31.970]  Great patriot.
[00:18:32.369 --> 00:18:47.369]  He's going to give you his view on what's happening with the deep state of America and also his particular perspective and how the FBI is telling him and other Individuals that ran around following the orders, running CIA hit teams,
[00:18:47.769 --> 00:18:54.750]  killing Islamic leaders, that, oh, there's a bunch of Islamic terrorists here, and we can't protect you, but, yeah, we're expecting, you know, a big attack soon.
[00:18:55.109 --> 00:18:59.490]  And then they see their houses getting cased by the Islamicists.
[00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.670]  Those are the shadow armies that have been brought in.
[00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:09.799]  You probably want to listen to him because he's led teams He was called the CIA's Angel of Death.
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:16.059]  So, the CIA's Angel of Death, that was his name, the Angel of Death will be here to tell us about what's going on.
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:25.980]  So, we have that information coming up today in studio for at least an hour and a half.
[00:19:26.579 --> 00:19:29.299]  And I appreciate him coming from very far away to be here.
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.079]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:19:32.019 --> 00:19:32.460]  Okay.
[00:19:34.439 --> 00:19:36.539]  So that's just some of the news.
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.559]  I'll start plowing through it.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:39.799]  Oh, and there's stuff like this.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.779]  I mean, we knew this.
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.920]  Because I've had this happen to me in front of crew.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:54.980]  The FBI, not just the CIA, sends in sex operatives.
[00:19:58.609 --> 00:20:01.230]  To try to infiltrate the Trump organization.
[00:20:02.109 --> 00:20:06.349]  And in 2016, 2017, when I made a Trump hotel or a Trump event...
[00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:09.930]  And I'd be sitting there at a table or having a meeting or at the bar.
[00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:14.509]  And it was always in twos, so they have a witness, just like how they set up Assange.
[00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.769]  They admit they had sex with Assange, but his condom broke, so it was rape.
[00:20:18.869 --> 00:20:19.210]  Remember that?
[00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:20.490]  And there'll be two women.
[00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:22.549]  You can tell they're sociologists, psychologists.
[00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:24.130]  They're analysts.
[00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:25.750]  They're with the CIA or State Department.
[00:20:26.049 --> 00:20:27.089]  They're sex operatives.
[00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:27.990]  They think they're really beautiful.
[00:20:28.309 --> 00:20:31.589]  And they start, after five minutes, let's just go to your hotel room right now.
[00:20:32.359 --> 00:20:35.440]  And I'm like, number one, I'm married, so I wouldn't do that anyways.
[00:20:35.559 --> 00:20:36.980]  And number two, I'm not Julian Assange.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.380]  Now, also, I think you're ugly.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:53.000]  I mean, I can see what you're both sociologists, what are anthropologists too, and what you've done some gun training, And so for America, you go around and set up politicians.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.259]  And I did this in front of Drew.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.519]  He doesn't work anymore.
[00:20:57.519 --> 00:20:59.019]  He's a great guy, but he took some other job.
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.380]  But Drew saw it one time.
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.440]  I said, how don't you take your ugly asses and get the F out of here?
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.099]  You think I'm a dumbass?
[00:21:10.259 --> 00:21:13.740]  Take your asses back to the CIA and burn in hell.
[00:21:16.319 --> 00:21:18.180]  You don't think I don't see what you are?
[00:21:18.619 --> 00:21:22.259]  And boy, you start telling them what degrees they've got and what you're probably...
[00:21:22.259 --> 00:21:23.759]  What you're like from New York?
[00:21:23.819 --> 00:21:24.460]  Are you from Maryland?
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.420]  Oh, your daddy did something for the government?
[00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:27.039]  Get out of here.
[00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:28.240]  Oh, what are you, sex operatives?
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.140]  I bet you were when you were kids or something.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.279]  I got your name.
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.200]  I got your number.
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.400]  I got your ass.
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.059]  I know everything about you.
[00:21:36.359 --> 00:21:37.759]  I see through you.
[00:21:41.079 --> 00:21:41.440]  So...
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.700]  Oh, sorry, I was telling a story.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:52.839]  Whistleblower James Comey had FBI honeypot spies infiltrate Trump 2016 campaign.
[00:21:53.819 --> 00:21:55.880]  And they lied to the inspector general.
[00:21:56.079 --> 00:21:56.740]  Oh, sure.
[00:21:57.019 --> 00:21:59.920]  The inspector general doesn't know they use sex operatives.
[00:22:00.059 --> 00:22:00.740]  Oh, sure.
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.240]  And Tom Brady doesn't know what a football is.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.380]  Ladies, why don't you take yourselves back to your loser agency and burn in hell?
[00:22:14.819 --> 00:22:16.400]  And by the way, you think you're pretty?
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.460]  You're gross.
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.000]  Yeah, I wouldn't have sex with you with his wiener.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.440]  I mean, I said a few things like that.
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.299]  Because they're trying to set me up.
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.619]  Hell, they might have poisoned me or killed me.
[00:22:31.309 --> 00:22:32.410]  These aren't women.
[00:22:32.609 --> 00:22:36.309]  These are enemies of America targeting the people trying to save the country.
[00:22:36.849 --> 00:22:37.490]  Fuck them!
[00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:38.430]  Fuck them!
[00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:40.230]  Excuse me.
[00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:41.670]  I hate them!
[00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:57.490]  And you know, despite hundreds of sex operatives and thousands of offers of money, they couldn't get one Trump prominent supporter in his orbit to take money or sex.
[00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:01.990]  Oh yeah, I had the FBI and the CIA try to give me a bunch of money too.
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:17.240]  And I reported it to the FBI so that, hey, it's on record that this group, your D.C. group is doing this, and I'm going to go to the media with it.
[00:23:17.319 --> 00:23:18.140]  So here's the report.
[00:23:18.599 --> 00:23:22.500]  Keep them away from me, you goddamn traitors.
[00:23:22.579 --> 00:23:22.980]  Excuse me.
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:28.799]  The point is that I'm not Tim Walz having sex with Chinese agents.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.220]  Got it?
[00:23:29.619 --> 00:23:34.160]  And I ain't having sex with the CIA agents either because they're just as bad and they're just as anti-American.
[00:23:35.359 --> 00:23:36.339]  And I'm tired of it.
[00:23:37.579 --> 00:23:52.259]  But the point is, I've experienced this, and I know what it's like, and it's BS! Julian Assange got sucked in by this, and off and on spent, what, 10 years basically in solitary confinement over it.
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.500]  So I take it damn serious what these people do.
[00:24:00.089 --> 00:24:01.049]  Alright, I'm gonna go to break.
[00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.670]  I'm gonna come back with all the clips, all the articles, all the things I've been mentioning.
[00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:04.269]  Oh, there's this.
[00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:05.190]  I told you last week.
[00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.109]  Putin's officially sent in.
[00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.990]  Now they're admitting it.
[00:24:10.089 --> 00:24:12.589]  North Korean troops are in combat in Ukraine.
[00:24:17.329 --> 00:24:19.069]  Hungarian security expert on Ukraine.
[00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.930]  Everything depends on who wins November 5th.
[00:24:21.089 --> 00:24:21.990]  Yeah, no kidding.
[00:24:25.329 --> 00:24:28.930]  There is so much coming up today.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.779]  There's also the big censorship news.
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:40.240]  Oh my God, YouTube won't let anybody search or find the Joe Rogan Trump interview.
[00:24:40.519 --> 00:24:41.700]  Yeah, it's election meddling.
[00:24:41.839 --> 00:24:43.519]  That's all they do and they never get in trouble.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:49.579]  They wouldn't let you for a month and a half see Trump getting shot or even admit it happened if you search Trump assassination attempt.
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:59.619]  You got Ronald Reagan and RFK and JFK. It's absolutely deceptive.
[00:25:00.859 --> 00:25:01.599]  And it's criminal.
[00:25:01.819 --> 00:25:04.099]  And it's being done in the direction of the deep state and we have the documents.
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.119]  That's coming up.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:05.779]  Before I go to break.
[00:25:09.559 --> 00:25:12.000]  We make it very easy to keep this broadcast on the air.
[00:25:12.099 --> 00:25:13.500]  We can be shut down the 13th.
[00:25:14.299 --> 00:25:20.880]  But regardless, if you fund our sponsors, myself, the crew, the operation will continue on.
[00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:23.000]  But it takes money to do that.
[00:25:23.119 --> 00:25:24.039]  But that's a side issue.
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.519]  You really want the products.
[00:25:26.099 --> 00:25:31.299]  So today is the last day to go to thealexjonesstore.com, thealexjonesstore.com.

[00:25:38.059 --> 00:25:40.359]  Today's the last day at midnight, Eastern time.

[00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:03.049]  Amazing t-shirts, hoodies, ball caps, a bunch of new incredible designs.

[00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:13.779]  You're backing the Second American Revolution.

[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:24.839]  You're backing people that are battle-tested in the info war and who will not back down and cannot be bought off and cannot be starved out and cannot be pushed around if you support me.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.299]  Because the one weak point is if I don't have the support, that's starved out.
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.039]  So, get great quality products.
[00:26:30.119 --> 00:26:31.019]  By the way, talk about...
[00:26:31.869 --> 00:26:32.809]  Low-cost items.

[00:26:45.329 --> 00:26:46.710]  Oh, man, you talk about energy focus.
[00:26:47.049 --> 00:26:48.190]  You just got all the super vitamins.
[00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:51.130]  However, God creates this moss with the iodine and all of it.
[00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:51.750]  It's just next level.
[00:26:52.309 --> 00:26:55.089]  That's all there at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.369]  And that's how we run this operation.
[00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:59.289]  So, take action now.
[00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:00.430]  Become a VIP member.
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.160]  Last day to get in to get the truck.
[00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:04.480]  It's going to be exciting to announce the winner.
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.240]  So much more at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:27:07.579 --> 00:27:08.480]  We're making history.
[00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:10.299]  When you support us, you're a part of the big win.
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:11.619]  So take action.
[00:27:11.799 --> 00:27:13.660]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action.
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:21.940]  When you take action in the info war, and when you back those savaging the enemy, you are part of literally plunging a double-edged dagger of truth directly into their carotid arteries.
[00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:33.049]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I say I'm excited about bringing you the ultimate gut cleanse, exclusively available at thealexjonesstore.com, I'm not joking around.
[00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:36.529]  We don't sit there and shoot in the dark.
[00:27:36.849 --> 00:27:47.289]  We go out and we find what are already the best-selling, highest-rated products in the country, and we say, hey, we'd like to private label it, but we'd like you to make it a little bit stronger for us so it's proprietary.
[00:27:47.849 --> 00:27:49.130]  You got it right here.
[00:27:49.779 --> 00:27:50.920]  The ultimate gut cleanse.
[00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:52.640]  This is not just a gut cleanse.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.140]  It's not just a detox.
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.420]  It doesn't just have natural ingredients that gently get rid of parasites.
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:58.759]  Oh, it's got that covered.
[00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:03.160]  It's then got a whole bunch of stuff in it like saw palmetto that's good for all your glands.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.119]  And even the government admits great for men's prostates.
[00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:08.329]  And it goes on and on.
[00:28:08.529 --> 00:28:10.009]  I cannot read all the ingredients.
[00:28:10.109 --> 00:28:11.170]  They're concentrated.
[00:28:11.369 --> 00:28:12.250]  They're incredible.
[00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:17.710]  You want to get it right now at thealexjonesstore.com for between 30% and 50% off.
[00:28:17.829 --> 00:28:21.109]  50% off when you do the combo and get it with the ultimate probiotic.
[00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:26.369]  Any way you slice it, we are destroying the globalists right now.
[00:28:26.369 --> 00:28:28.650]  Whether they kill Trump, steal the election, it doesn't matter.
[00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.630]  We've ripped their mask off.
[00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:38.150]  30-plus years of work is now coming to fruition.
[00:28:39.829 --> 00:28:41.910]  And we are in the danger zone.
[00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.890]  You can feel the energy.
[00:28:50.809 --> 00:28:57.970]  Now, I've really been thinking about every angle of this, and it hit me last night, it hit me this morning, it hit me throwing on air.
[00:28:58.089 --> 00:28:59.049]  I need to be more positive.
[00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:02.809]  Because there is the paradox of all the bad happening.
[00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:07.390]  But you can see God's plan playing out in front of you.
[00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:09.890]  So, let's get into Biden.
[00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:13.490]  He was a busy, busy boy yesterday.
[00:29:14.849 --> 00:29:26.289]  Busy, globalist, chi-com pedophile that sold our country out and is trying to start World War III. But as Trump pointed out, he's a puppet.
[00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:29.390]  And there was a coup against him.
[00:29:29.589 --> 00:29:30.369]  You can't debate that.
[00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:32.490]  You could try to debate, was it stolen from Trump in 2020?
[00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:35.269]  The evidence is there, but some people don't know that.
[00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:43.089]  But you can't debate that he was removed and Kamala installed and he dropped out of the race after they had a medical emergency and put out a fake resignation letter that's all confirmed.
[00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:45.170]  And Pelosi says, oh, I thought it was fake.
[00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:45.890]  I don't know who did it.
[00:29:47.869 --> 00:29:49.009]  That is so huge.
[00:29:49.069 --> 00:29:50.529]  And that's another clip coming up in a moment.
[00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:56.200]  Trump, you know, the headline, Trump The presidency was stolen.
[00:29:56.319 --> 00:29:57.839]  People go, oh my god, he's saying from him!
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.700]  You're not supposed to say that!
[00:30:00.599 --> 00:30:04.319]  But no, he says, from Biden, which is totally documented.
[00:30:05.539 --> 00:30:06.880]  Such a key point to hammer.
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:13.140]  You hammer the coup, you hammer the 325,000 missing kids, many of them found in slave labor and sex slavery.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.279]  You promise to find them and prosecute those that did it.
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:26.119]  You hammer stopping World War III. And Trump's doing it.
[00:30:26.279 --> 00:30:37.619]  So Biden gets up and tries to riff off the Tony Hitchcliffe comment at the Madison Square Garden Sunday and says, you know, I'd like to take Trump out here swimming with me.
[00:30:38.019 --> 00:30:41.200]  I mean, I'd like to take him behind the school and kick his ass.
[00:30:41.579 --> 00:30:43.200]  You know, kind of said that twice.
[00:30:43.759 --> 00:30:47.140]  But it's obviously, you know, kind of a Sicilian thing, though he's not Sicilian.
[00:30:47.339 --> 00:30:48.599]  You know, where's Luco Brazzi?
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:49.500]  Well, he sleeps with the fishes.
[00:30:51.519 --> 00:30:55.039]  Well, yeah, I'd like to take him out of there in the ocean with me, you know what I mean?
[00:30:55.339 --> 00:30:56.819]  Give him some Seaman shoes.
[00:30:57.619 --> 00:31:03.319]  Then in another little gaff, he's the only garbage I see is these Trump supporters.
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.839]  Well, see, that's not a comic making a joke out of context.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.700]  That's the president and whoever runs him saying that.
[00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:24.609]  So the poll numbers instantly showed a 3-4 point drop for her, even more than we've seen ever before, on top of all the others.
[00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:30.690]  And Harris is now running away from it.
[00:31:32.529 --> 00:31:37.589]  And the betting averages have gone now from the high 60s up to the 70s.
[00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:43.869]  Over the low 60s and the high 60s, depending on the betting average, it's way more accurate than polls.
[00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:50.869]  And yeah, no, Trump's going to win a landslide in the real world, but will they be able to mitigate it with the fraud?
[00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:57.329]  I don't see them being able to steal all the battlegrounds like they did last time, four years ago.
[00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:01.170]  But the sneak attack on Texas, they've been paying a lot of attention to Texas.
[00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:06.250]  They've been doing a lot of beavering, a lot of illegal aliens, a lot of shenanigans.
[00:32:07.279 --> 00:32:10.680]  The Secretary of State a month ago saying, oh, we're going to let people vote with non-citizen IDs.
[00:32:12.099 --> 00:32:12.960]  It's not good.
[00:32:14.279 --> 00:32:16.339]  So you ask what my prediction is.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:22.299]  I don't think the globalists know it's going to happen on November 5th and then when they're able to string this out as they promised to do.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:31.819]  But you know when they say, oh, don't worry, we'll have enough ballots to override Trump four years ago, now they're saying it again, and then the Nevada Supreme Court says, yeah, you don't need postmarks.
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.779]  Anything that just shows up for three days after from anywhere...
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.579]  Truck pulls in, whatever, middle of the night, whatever, we just count it.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.920]  That is outrageously obvious.
[00:32:44.319 --> 00:32:48.079]  And then buses showing up with what looks like illegal aliens and the names don't match.
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:48.960]  That's okay, sweetheart.
[00:32:49.059 --> 00:32:50.119]  You can vote however you want.
[00:32:51.759 --> 00:32:52.400]  Got it all.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.220]  And guys show up, big boxes with out-of-state plates just marching in.
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:57.480]  I got all these ballots.
[00:32:59.369 --> 00:33:04.829]  And then they catch people all over Pennsylvania with giant voter registration fraud groups putting people in the voter rolls.
[00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:10.509]  And Michigan says you keep 500 plus thousand phantom voters that never voted but are on the roll somehow but aren't registered.
[00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:11.470]  They can vote.
[00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:12.869]  Just don't worry about it.
[00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:17.410]  But I don't think they can override this landslide.
[00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.250]  They tried to override it in 2016.
[00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:24.349]  Trump did not win the landslide in 2020 because people thought he was invincible in the Q stuff.
[00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:30.089]  And this time it's a bigger landslide than 2016 the numbers are showing.
[00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:34.150]  And I haven't seen that for months and now you see the Trump campaign saying it as well because they see the numbers.
[00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:36.650]  And they don't just have polls.
[00:33:36.829 --> 00:33:41.309]  They've got AI database systems that can scan what people are really saying and aggregated.
[00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:58.119]  So here is Biden with the garbage comment and let's segue into he'd like to take Trump for a swim out in the ocean with the fishes and then let's go straight into Kamala Running from this.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:02.579]  This is what defeat smells like and looks like and tastes like.
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:03.059]  Here it is.
[00:34:03.579 --> 00:34:08.820]  Puerto Rico, where I'm in my home state of Delaware, they're good, decent, honorable people.
[00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:11.960]  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:16.420]  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.
[00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:23.079]  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.699]  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.920]  Including, yes, Puerto Rico.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.360]  I'd like to take that guy for a swim out there.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:41.280]  Anyway.
[00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:45.530]  Listen, I think that, first of all, he clarified his comments.
[00:34:45.869 --> 00:34:55.210]  But let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.
[00:34:55.429 --> 00:35:08.650]  As you heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career, I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not.
[00:35:09.269 --> 00:35:14.449]  And as president of the United States, I will be a president for all Americans, whether you vote for me or not.
[00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:20.230]  That is my responsibility, and that's the kind of work that I've done my entire career, and I take it very seriously.
[00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:31.630]  All of her surrogates Run around saying Trump supporters are Hitler, the devil, terrorists, the CIA, the FBI, they've all put out reports.
[00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:35.289]  Oh my God, the number one terror threat is Trump supporters.
[00:35:35.469 --> 00:35:37.429]  They're going to kill people on election day and after.
[00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:44.909]  And so we've got to have an armed uprising and we've got to not certify them and we've got to have civil war to stop them from civil war.
[00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:46.909]  You're like, that's not logical.
[00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:49.110]  Well, their voters aren't logical.
[00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:52.949]  They just hear this crap like Trump wants to put us all in prison.
[00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:54.650]  Well, they're like, we need to put all the Trump supporters in prison.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:03.500]  So that garbage comment, look, she's already going to lose, but they need it to be convincing if they steal it.
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:17.139]  And it's not convincing, and I can tell you at the highest levels of the whole corporate roundtable systems that control the corrupt government, they're sitting around right now, today, tonight, tomorrow, going...
[00:36:18.269 --> 00:36:22.849]  Alright, do we go ahead and tell our groups, go ahead and trigger the crises, go into civil war conditions?
[00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:38.550]  Because we've been identified, and our COVID power grab blew up in our face, and everything else has blown up in our face, and there's a huge political realignment, and we already failed to kill him twice, and if we do this, I mean, it's probably not going to work,
[00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:41.269]  and then we're all going to finally get arrested.
[00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:47.130]  While Democrats want to ban assault weapons, extremist monger Republicans try to ban books.
[00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:47.750]  There's Kamala.
[00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:54.050]  MAGA extremists dare tell us what is in our own best interest.
[00:36:55.369 --> 00:37:00.949]  I mean, she says Trump and his supporters are coming to kill you.
[00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:03.090]  She said it two weeks ago last week.
[00:37:03.889 --> 00:37:04.849]  Like the clubs.
[00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:08.309]  Oh no, I've said I love everybody.
[00:37:15.139 --> 00:37:21.300]  And Trump has said the left is turning America into a garbage can and they're dumping the mentally ill and the criminals on us.
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:31.460]  I mean, Venezuela said two years ago, we're going to release rapists and murderers and they told them in a decree, you must leave to America or you're back in prison.
[00:37:31.679 --> 00:37:32.940]  That's dumping garbage.
[00:37:33.099 --> 00:37:37.980]  It's not calling America garbage to say we're not the world's garbage dump.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.800]  But you see something on the Drudge Report.
[00:37:43.849 --> 00:37:45.590]  That's the mouth of the New World Order.
[00:37:46.469 --> 00:37:50.170]  By the way, I owe Matt Drudge a lot, and he was a great guy, and you knew him.
[00:37:50.989 --> 00:37:52.849]  He's not been heard of in five, six years.
[00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:57.409]  In fact, did they kidnap him?
[00:37:57.489 --> 00:37:58.530]  Did they give him cement shoes?
[00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:01.150]  Is he like a mummy in a basement?
[00:38:02.989 --> 00:38:03.590]  I don't know.
[00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:08.369]  Every time I talk about Matt, he puts up an InfoWars link, like, no, it's me.
[00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:09.630]  Wink, wink, twice, you're there.
[00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:10.530]  Okay, buddy, whatever.
[00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.550]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[00:38:16.789 --> 00:38:17.710]  Absolutely insane.
[00:38:17.809 --> 00:38:19.070]  Let's put the Drudge Report back up there.
[00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:27.170]  The New World Order report, the mouth of the New World Order, the sphincter of whatever it is.
[00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:29.650]  Trump, America's a garbage can.
[00:38:29.809 --> 00:38:31.150]  Biden, MAGA is garbage.
[00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:43.929]  Harris, taking out the trash, six days in USA. Yeah, it's five till the election, but six days in You know, until we're in the middle of it, but it's already the early voting in New Jersey.
[00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:45.369]  The Republicans are ahead in early voting.
[00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:47.090]  Republicans are ahead in a bunch of other states.
[00:38:49.829 --> 00:39:03.650]  So, now, White House media allies blame missing apostrophe edit in the teleprompter in desperate bid to spend Biden's garbage comment.
[00:39:05.019 --> 00:39:05.900]  I want to play this clip.
[00:39:06.039 --> 00:39:14.019]  Trump says they stole the presidency of the United States, and people saw that headline, and they got massive views, and the left didn't even watch it.
[00:39:14.079 --> 00:39:15.940]  They jumped and said, look, he's saying they stole the election again.
[00:39:16.039 --> 00:39:18.039]  No, which they did.
[00:39:18.039 --> 00:39:19.219]  He should keep saying that.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.760]  They attack him because it's true.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.940]  They don't want him to say it.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.079]  Oh, we attack you, so don't say it.
[00:39:23.139 --> 00:39:25.219]  No, what they attack is what they're afraid of, so say it.
[00:39:25.519 --> 00:39:28.659]  But here he nails it because you cannot debate.
[00:39:29.619 --> 00:39:36.980]  That they removed him and made her the nominee with no votes, and that Biden's not running anything, and the two are fighting with each other publicly.
[00:39:37.159 --> 00:39:38.360]  So the enemy's in disarray.
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:38.760]  That's good.
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:39.219]  Here's the clip.
[00:39:40.659 --> 00:39:45.619]  So I'm running on a plan to save America.
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.059]  We're gonna save America.
[00:39:47.199 --> 00:39:48.139]  We have no choice.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.480]  It's the greatest there is.
[00:39:49.579 --> 00:39:51.059]  We love it, and we're gonna save it.
[00:39:51.139 --> 00:39:51.920]  We have no choice.
[00:39:53.739 --> 00:40:04.079]  And it's going to be saving it from the incredible Destruction that's been caused by crooked Joe Biden and Kamala.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.800]  And she's responsible because he wasn't responsible and she never said that.
[00:40:09.019 --> 00:40:11.500]  He didn't know too much about what was happening.
[00:40:11.659 --> 00:40:13.460]  Maybe that was exposed during the debate.
[00:40:14.079 --> 00:40:19.219]  And yet still the way they took that away from him was not Was not right.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.099]  It wasn't right.
[00:40:20.239 --> 00:40:21.340]  Shouldn't have happened that way.
[00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:22.139]  They walked in.
[00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:23.380]  They said, we're taking it away.
[00:40:23.539 --> 00:40:26.099]  They stole the presidency of the United States.
[00:40:26.659 --> 00:40:28.039]  You can call it a coup.
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.159]  You can call it whatever.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.119]  But they stole it.
[00:40:30.159 --> 00:40:32.699]  They went in like taking candy from a baby.
[00:40:34.519 --> 00:40:35.400]  And there you go.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.079]  Total truth.
[00:40:36.199 --> 00:40:36.820]  Perfectly said.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:38.739]  I made a perfect statement.
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:39.820]  It's perfect.
[00:40:40.019 --> 00:40:40.679]  It is perfect.
[00:40:42.079 --> 00:40:45.460]  Okay, so now let's move on to this.
[00:40:46.199 --> 00:40:47.539]  No illegals are voting.
[00:40:48.650 --> 00:41:00.769]  Federal judges all over the country, at least 10 states, and every time I think it's 10, it was like a 9 the other day, it was 10 yesterday, appeals courts rule that illegal aliens can vote.
[00:41:01.809 --> 00:41:04.190]  But remember, illegal aliens aren't voting, that's insane.
[00:41:07.949 --> 00:41:15.030]  Well, the Supreme Court just ruled that illegal aliens cannot be officially on the voter rolls, registered voters.
[00:41:16.269 --> 00:41:18.710]  Because Virginia got their case to the Supreme Court quickly.
[00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:21.690]  The other states are pushing it up there as well.
[00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:23.449]  But is it a day late, a dollar short?
[00:41:24.389 --> 00:41:28.389]  Supreme Court hands down Virginia a huge win on election integrity.
[00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:31.030]  Biden DOJ hardest hit.
[00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:34.530]  And the Supreme Court said, this is ridiculous.
[00:41:34.849 --> 00:41:37.329]  Illegal aliens cannot vote under the Constitution.
[00:41:37.809 --> 00:41:50.550]  But the left, out of one side of their mouth for 20 years, has initiatives that illegals can vote, and it's good, and it's loving, and it's only in local elections, but almost all elections are held during off-year and general elections.
[00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:51.590]  Everybody knows that.
[00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:57.630]  You go vote for mayor and governor and city council at the same time for Congress and senator.
[00:41:58.559 --> 00:42:00.599]  And for president.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.900]  Every four, but everything else, every two.
[00:42:05.099 --> 00:42:09.699]  And so, why are the federal courts saying illegals can vote then if they're not voting?
[00:42:11.059 --> 00:42:21.239]  And remember Obama, eight years ago, in the eve of the last election, that Trump won, hands down, said, if you're here, you get to vote.
[00:42:22.079 --> 00:42:23.380]  On Telemundo.
[00:42:26.249 --> 00:42:30.349]  So, out of one side of their mouth, they're normalizing it, and out of the other, they just deny it's happening.
[00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:40.449]  Just like for a long time, there's no plan for a carbon tax or world government to ban your range stove, and then now, yep, yep, we're banning it.
[00:42:41.909 --> 00:42:44.190]  There's no plan to ban beef, but we are going to ban your beef.
[00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:50.570]  Supreme Court hands Virginia a huge win on election integrity.
[00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:53.250]  Biden-DOJ hardest hit a month ago.
[00:42:53.329 --> 00:43:02.510]  After months of back and forth over whether the state of Virginia would be allowed to purge non-citizens from its voting rolls, the Supreme Court stepped in with an emergency stay.
[00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:08.710]  This came after a lower court previously ruled that non-citizens must be put back on the rolls.
[00:43:10.349 --> 00:43:13.010]  Not a good thing for the old deep state.
[00:43:14.289 --> 00:43:18.030]  Supreme Court reinstates Glenn Youngkin's voter purge in Virginia.
[00:43:22.699 --> 00:43:26.099]  And here's the Supreme Court's order for you.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.139]  Because unlike the corporate media, when we tell you about something, we show it to you.
[00:43:31.559 --> 00:43:33.500]  Yeah, Trump wants to kill all the black people.
[00:43:33.619 --> 00:43:34.599]  He just said it last week.
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:35.659]  Where's the video?
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.820]  Trump's going to use the military to kill you.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:38.420]  Where's the video?
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:51.139]  In fact, we've got an executive order by Biden and the green lighting in September for civil unrest, martial law, the military taking over, and quote, lethal force on citizens.
[00:43:52.989 --> 00:43:53.730]  That's not Trump.
[00:43:55.489 --> 00:43:57.929]  Again, facts are stubborn things.
[00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:00.670]  Now, moving on to this.
[00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:04.869]  Shock video, and now there's more of these coming out.
[00:44:05.389 --> 00:44:12.530]  Buses of non-English speaking, quote, citizens fast-tracked ahead of Americans waiting in line for hours to vote.
[00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:13.909]  Now, I want to say something about this before I show it.
[00:44:16.109 --> 00:44:17.690]  I thought about this a lot yesterday.
[00:44:17.889 --> 00:44:18.949]  I shot a special report on it.
[00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:21.630]  And the witnesses say they went up and the names didn't even match.
[00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:23.670]  So the people said, oh, we'll just go back and get the right name.
[00:44:24.369 --> 00:44:26.789]  And it fits into this all over Pennsylvania.
[00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:32.050]  They caught giant fake voter registration drives with people that were real citizens but weren't voting.
[00:44:32.409 --> 00:44:33.750]  The police went and checked with them.
[00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:34.710]  No, I didn't register to vote.
[00:44:34.789 --> 00:44:35.309]  No, I didn't do this.
[00:44:35.389 --> 00:44:35.969]  No, that's not my signature.
[00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:37.949]  But most of them were just fake names.
[00:44:39.289 --> 00:44:44.329]  And they were hoping they would just send them back and then they could send these people in to vote in those names.
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:51.260]  There's a lot of coordination that goes into this, so it didn't go too well.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:55.699]  But then I started watching these videos, and it really hit me.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.900]  They're sending these NGOs out, Open Democrat Party NGOs.
[00:44:59.139 --> 00:45:01.340]  You can read their t-shirts and search it, and it's Democrat Party.
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:02.900]  Of course it is.
[00:45:03.199 --> 00:45:06.539]  This Democrat Party initiative is getting the fake voter registrations in.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:19.690]  That they're parading these people in front of Of the crowd and having them cut in line in front of the clear citizens to get a response.
[00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:25.190]  They are really poking the bear here, trying to break the back of the camel with another straw.
[00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:29.070]  And so the straw didn't work, they're putting, you know, a hundred pound weight on it.
[00:45:30.429 --> 00:45:30.789]  And...
[00:45:30.789 --> 00:45:34.170]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:45:34.869 --> 00:45:41.130]  But you see the videos from years ago where they passed the law in New York, where they gave legal aliens, driver's license, and they're around the block doing it.
[00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:43.130]  So this is just out in the open.
[00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:45.929]  Let's go ahead and play that video.
[00:45:50.779 --> 00:45:52.239]  No, they had these people.
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:54.460]  They had about 12 of them walked in.
[00:45:54.599 --> 00:45:55.739]  They were all foreigners.
[00:45:56.059 --> 00:45:57.219]  And then they took them up.
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.639]  These younger people helped them to fill out.
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:01.480]  They say, vote PA today.
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:03.280]  And then they took them up.
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.500]  And somehow they feed a two-hour line.
[00:46:05.739 --> 00:46:07.900]  And then they walked up into one lady.
[00:46:08.039 --> 00:46:09.659]  They were even asking her.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.460]  They're like, we don't have you in the system.
[00:46:11.719 --> 00:46:12.840]  Your name's not right.
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.019]  And they're like, oh, well, we'll take it back and change it.
[00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:16.679]  How do you change your damn name?
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.360]  Well, thank you.
[00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:28.469]  And it goes on and on.
[00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:31.090]  More video at RealAlexJonesOnX and Infowars.com.
[00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:32.090]  I suggest you share it.
[00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:33.590]  And there's more of this coming out.
[00:46:35.369 --> 00:46:39.630]  And again, I've seen enough illegals from different places.
[00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:43.489]  They look Mesoamerican.
[00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:46.289]  They look like they're from Guatemala.
[00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:48.989]  That's a big part of the groups they're bringing into Pennsylvania.
[00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:50.989]  And they don't even know.
[00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:52.170]  They're just told, hey, go do this.
[00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:53.550]  And they're led by who they think is an official.
[00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:55.210]  And they're brought to the head of the line.
[00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:57.960]  And then There you go.
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:02.420]  And you want to see the raw footage?
[00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:03.760]  Here it is, right here.
[00:47:06.219 --> 00:47:10.739]  But it's all up on Relox Jones on X. There's another video.
[00:47:11.179 --> 00:47:12.760]  Lie to your husband, vote Kamala.
[00:47:13.119 --> 00:47:20.139]  The Harris campaign actually put a video out saying this, like, oh, it's a secret little good thing to vote for your oppressors.
[00:47:21.329 --> 00:47:21.949]  Look at this video.
[00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:28.090]  Man spotted dropping off obscene amount of ballots at Northampton, PA last minute.
[00:47:28.289 --> 00:47:30.769]  The man reportedly has Rhode Island license plates.
[00:47:30.989 --> 00:47:36.230]  Why Rhode Island plates in PA? Might be a logical explanation, but see something, say something.
[00:47:36.469 --> 00:47:42.530]  It should at least be following up on by local officials.
[00:47:44.150 --> 00:48:09.219]  Yeah, well they found a bunch of fraud and then The state database of registered voters got magically taken down that Homeland Security and the FBI warned two months ago was imminent that Russians or some foreign group would hack the voter registration databases so that they wouldn't know who was voting.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.980]  Now, who wants illegals to vote or dead people to vote?
[00:48:12.039 --> 00:48:18.110]  Oh, but the Russians are going to get a system That does that.
[00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:21.789]  Isn't that convenient yet again?
[00:48:21.929 --> 00:48:23.429]  Of course, there's no proof the Russians did it.
[00:48:23.889 --> 00:48:25.429]  That's just what they told us.
[00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:30.309]  Because they like to pre-program what they're about to do.
[00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:39.269]  Now, I'm going to start the next hour and get into a bunch of other election news, a bunch of big developments.
[00:48:40.719 --> 00:48:49.380]  Oh, the most powerful Maha ad, Make America Healthy Again Alliance, that Elon Musk is the guy behind with RFK Jr.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:56.079]  And Del Bigtree is the head of it, and the great Mickey Willis put these ads together.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:59.400]  I mean, these are just the best, hands down.
[00:48:59.739 --> 00:49:04.780]  And you just look at the genuineness of Tulsi Gabbards and all these folks.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:05.599]  Compare the Democrats.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:06.519]  I mean, it's night...
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:08.239]  And day.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:12.039]  So that's coming up at the start of the next hour and so much more.
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:14.059]  We're winning.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:22.599]  But people need to be focused and they need to be frosty and they need to be citizen journalists and need to report and expose all the garbage going on.
[00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:23.599]  And there's a big terror attack.
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:28.320]  We got to instantly analyze who stands to gain and what the on-the-ground witnesses are saying.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:32.039]  Just like with the attempted Trump assassinations, so we get the truth out.
[00:49:32.139 --> 00:49:32.820]  That's where it comes from.
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:38.699]  The FBI's being sued by the governor in Florida trying to cover up what really happened down there at the golf course.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.900]  I mean, it's on.
[00:49:40.019 --> 00:49:43.599]  But we're not naive anymore, and we've got a lot of allies at the state and local level.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.300]  The military's awake.
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:46.900]  A lot of exciting things are happening.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.039]  But we're in a fight for the future.
[00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:51.070]  And separately, remember, you're the Paul Revere's.
[00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:52.449]  The globalists hate this show.
[00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:56.690]  They believe it's one of the most effective to get the truth out because it is because of you and the work we do together.
[00:49:56.809 --> 00:49:57.650]  This is a team effort.
[00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:00.349]  So please share the links from Real Alex Jones to the live feed.
[00:50:00.409 --> 00:50:01.469]  Hey, here's the forbidden show.
[00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:02.349]  Please share it.

[00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:04.849]  Tell them to share it and so on.
[00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:06.969]  And support the broadcast.
[00:50:07.429 --> 00:50:12.090]  It's a long story, but the deep state and the Justice Department want to shut down the 13th of November.
[00:50:14.329 --> 00:50:23.389]  We're now 13 days out from that, but we have great sponsors that they won't be able to shut down, and we've got the crew, and we've got backup systems.
[00:50:23.389 --> 00:50:24.210]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:33.690]  But we're not fully energized and fully funded that if we are shut down on the 14th to explode out of the blocks like a sprinter and just kick ass.
[00:50:35.429 --> 00:50:36.889]  So energize us now.
[00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:46.329]  There's not a better place to bet in the fight and get incredible products because I want them to work great so you love them, so you keep using them, so we have a symbiotic relationship.

[00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:07.389]  So when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[00:53:08.119 --> 00:53:18.219]  So if you're a member of the Alex Jones VIP Club at alexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP or there's just a big link at the top of the page, this is a critical time in our nation.

[00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:55.309]  So, theallocshownstore.com forward slash VIP. Orders at the top of theallocshownstore.com, you see the VIP button.
[00:54:55.699 --> 00:54:57.639]  We're fighting the new world order.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:59.519]  I don't have billionaire backers.
[00:54:59.679 --> 00:55:04.239]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:05.659]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.400]  Yellowshowstore.com.
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:13.690]  It's up to you whether you want to back The number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[00:55:13.949 --> 00:55:23.010]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:30.250]  And I just don't know why I'm this lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[00:55:30.389 --> 00:55:32.409]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[00:55:32.909 --> 00:55:35.349]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:36.610]  We've already...
[00:55:37.469 --> 00:55:38.550]  Just devastated them.
[00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:41.710]  I mean, world government, the new world orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[00:55:41.969 --> 00:55:43.269]  The whole world's turning against them.
[00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:44.889]  They're super dangerous.
[00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:47.590]  They're throwing the kitchen sink at us, try to keep control.
[00:55:47.969 --> 00:55:58.230]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've ever stood, that I should let these criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:00.050]  So again, I don't give up.
[00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:02.909]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:06.550]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[00:56:06.769 --> 00:56:09.010]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[00:56:09.130 --> 00:56:10.489]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:19.210]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over us with a social credit score, and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[00:56:19.389 --> 00:56:24.190]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum.
[00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:27.570]  And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:31.389]  I mean, it's just, this is a joke.
[00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:32.889]  This is ridiculous.
[00:56:33.289 --> 00:56:34.449]  We're changing the world.
[00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:37.429]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
[00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:48.110]  During the George Floyd riots, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey abandoned the city's third precinct, surrendering it to rioters who then set fire to it.
[00:56:48.269 --> 00:56:51.030]  The mayor defends abandoning the third precinct.
[00:56:51.059 --> 00:57:02.320]  If we were to continue to attempt to hold the third precinct, very likely there would have been hand-to-hand combat, likely serious injury, and maybe death.
[00:57:02.639 --> 00:57:09.900]  After the George Floyd riots, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was in the spotlight to defund the police.
[00:57:10.119 --> 00:57:17.099]  Majority of Minneapolis's city council is pledging to defund or dismantle the police department.
[00:57:17.639 --> 00:57:19.420]  Following the death of George Floyd.
[00:57:19.559 --> 00:57:23.039]  However, the city's mayor, Jacob Frey, opposes that.
[00:57:27.679 --> 00:57:34.280]  Protesters chanted, go home, Jacob, over the weekend after he said he does not support dismantling the department.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.679]  You campaigned on reform.
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.099]  That's part of how you got elected.
[00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:40.579]  You have reformed the body cam policy.
[00:57:40.579 --> 00:57:42.579]  You have banned warrior training.
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:45.440]  But we still have the George Floyd incident.
[00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:47.650]  Is reform enough?
[00:57:47.869 --> 00:57:53.949]  I don't want to comment on precisely what the council meant by disbanding or ending the police force.
[00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:55.869]  I think there's varying opinions.
[00:57:56.070 --> 00:58:02.809]  But what I'm saying is, look, I'm not for abolishing, but deep structural reform, absolutely, we have to make it happen.
[00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:07.989]  To reform the police, they decided to replace SWAT teams with social workers.
[00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:13.809]  Governor Tim Walz gave it his stamp of approval while admitting they don't have the staff to do it.
[00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:26.429]  This idea of violence interveners and problem solvers or social workers pairing with police to respond to some mental health calls, many of those are domestic situations that escalate very quickly and turn violent.
[00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:32.050]  How realistic is it to have a social worker respond with a police officer in real time?
[00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:38.050]  I'm just curious, would it almost require a separate force of social workers and violence interveners?
[00:58:38.269 --> 00:58:41.429]  To respond to these calls and how would that work in practical?
[00:58:41.849 --> 00:58:45.469]  Well, here's what I would tell you is when it comes to social workers, I've been talking about this forever.
[00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:51.750]  I think we talk about Minnesota and I oftentimes point the rosy picture of where we rank on certain things.
[00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:55.909]  You've heard me say this as a teacher, we rank last on school counselors and social workers.
[00:58:56.130 --> 00:59:00.889]  So one of the things is of trying to find those people, trying to have them out there and trying to have them integrated into real life.
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:13.019]  Last week, on Wednesday, October 23rd, 2024, Davis Maturi was doing yard work outside his South Minneapolis home when his neighbor shot him.
[00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:21.920]  Surveillance video obtained by NBC Minneapolis affiliate Care 11 shows the moment Maturi fell to the ground.
[00:59:22.219 --> 00:59:34.900]  His neighbor, John Sawczak, was then charged with second-degree attempted murder, first-degree assault, and stalking and harassment because Maturi has been reporting him to the police for over a year.
[00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:46.409]  According to court documents, Matori had called police on Sawcheck 19 times in the last year, alleging his neighbor had threatened to kill him and his wife, brandished a knife at them, and hurled racial slurs.
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:54.039]  Maturi was told by a female police commander that her officers were frightened of Sawchack and she didn't want to put them at risk.
[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:57.719]  After shooting his neighbor, Sawchack was not arrested.
[00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:03.079]  They sent social workers and psychologists to try and de-escalate the situation.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:09.599]  And after days of this, Frey and O'Hara had a press conference to complain about the public's outrage.
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:14.099]  To that victim, I say I am sorry that this happened to you.
[01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:20.949]  But it could not be anything further from the truth to say that we did nothing or that we just simply don't care.
[01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.630]  That's not true.
[01:00:21.789 --> 01:00:31.969]  Everything that we do is impacted by the reality that the police department is much smaller today than what it was prior to 2020, and we are dealing with a much higher call load.
[01:00:32.110 --> 01:00:37.949]  We cannot, as a community, on one hand say, hey, we want cops to use less force.
[01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:39.670]  We want less SWAT teams.
[01:00:39.789 --> 01:00:41.369]  We want more de-escalation.
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:46.719]  And then when we actually do that, say, how come the cops didn't use the SWAT team right away?
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:50.260]  We have been there 24-7 the last few days.
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:53.519]  We have been using our behavioral threat assessment team.
[01:00:53.559 --> 01:00:55.179]  We have used a psychiatrist.
[01:00:55.179 --> 01:00:58.000]  We have spoken to this individual's family.
[01:00:58.239 --> 01:01:02.440]  We have made dozens of attempts to attempt to contact this person.
[01:01:02.559 --> 01:01:08.460]  But again, to say that we simply don't care or we did nothing is simply not true.
[01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:14.980]  This feels a whole lot more like politics than it does like somebody that's trying to find a solution.
[01:01:15.199 --> 01:01:17.360]  We're about trying to find a solution right now.
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:18.960]  Again, less politics.
[01:01:19.219 --> 01:01:20.039]  That kind of thing is gross.
[01:01:20.659 --> 01:01:25.800]  Hours after this press conference, Sawchack was finally arrested and taken into custody.
[01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:30.659]  If you're saying you're scared, what does that do to me, you know?
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.800]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:52.409]  Five days till election day and all over the country, places like New Jersey that hadn't happened in decades, Republican votes outnumber Democrat voters right now in the data they have.
[01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:53.530]  And it's happening everywhere.
[01:01:53.909 --> 01:01:57.630]  The establishment is in free fall right now.
[01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:00.750]  Their entire criminal agenda is coming out.
[01:02:02.050 --> 01:02:03.250]  And that makes them super dangerous.
[01:02:03.489 --> 01:02:12.190]  And they've been telegraphing that, oh, the Trump supporters, the number one terror threat, why Trump supporters are going to stage terror attacks or shoot up poll workers or kill minorities.
[01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:20.070]  I covered that for an hour yesterday showing ABC News, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, CNN. I mean, it's just everywhere.
[01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:21.750]  You don't need me to tell you that.
[01:02:21.809 --> 01:02:22.329]  You see it.
[01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:23.869]  Where's the evidence?
[01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:27.309]  It's just as ridiculous as saying the Madison Square Garden rally was a Nazi rally.
[01:02:28.909 --> 01:02:29.929]  And you've got Biden...
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:37.699]  Saying he'd like to take Trump for a swim out in the ocean, a clear threat, and then saying, you know, the only garbage is his supporters.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.099]  They're desperate.
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:43.099]  And they're saying they're going to create civil war conditions.
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.380]  They're saying they're not going to accept a win.
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.659]  They're saying they're not going to certify Trump.
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:56.039]  And Trump's starting to talk about that and getting ahead of that because it's preposterous unless they have some type of George Floyd event or something to trigger things.
[01:02:56.929 --> 01:02:58.010]  And that's the big threat.
[01:02:58.550 --> 01:03:00.650]  And the Democrats say they're not going to accept the election.
[01:03:00.769 --> 01:03:01.590]  They're going to string it out.
[01:03:01.989 --> 01:03:03.389]  They've got all these federal rulings.
[01:03:03.469 --> 01:03:04.750]  They can keep it open for weeks.
[01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:10.449]  Though the Supreme Court started slapping that down today, saying, no, you can't have illegal aliens on the voter rolls in Virginia.
[01:03:10.809 --> 01:03:13.710]  Well, are they going to slap it down all the other states where federal judges said they could do that?
[01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:19.050]  So, any way you look at this, the good news is the truth is coming out.
[01:03:19.329 --> 01:03:24.090]  This is a giant wake-up call for so many people that were naive.
[01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:34.730]  And everything we've talked about and documented for decades and decades and decades, and that many others have exposed as well, is now coming into fruition.
[01:03:37.389 --> 01:03:47.369]  And now we learn, oh, there were sex operatives targeting Trump campaign people and his supporters by the FBI. Now we learn Tim Walz is a communist Chinese agent.
[01:03:48.769 --> 01:03:51.170]  And now we begin to learn all of this.
[01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:56.789]  And so many conservative headlines are, oh, 10 ways Kamala was an idiot, didn't do a good job.
[01:03:57.010 --> 01:03:59.510]  She did a great job on the border with Mayorkas.
[01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:00.809]  The job was to get rid of the border.
[01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:04.750]  Biden said, when I win this election, immediately surge the border.
[01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:06.789]  And we will make you legal.
[01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:08.969]  Remember those clips?
[01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:09.730]  Want to see it again?
[01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:10.829]  Probably played it 500 times.
[01:04:12.130 --> 01:04:13.170]  It's deliberate.
[01:04:13.409 --> 01:04:13.869]  Look at this headline.
[01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:17.949]  Top five reasons Kamala did nothing to stop 10 million illegals.
[01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:19.469]  Number five is ridiculous.
[01:04:20.469 --> 01:04:22.110]  She didn't do nothing.
[01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:28.730]  If you take your month-old baby and throw it in the pool, you murdered it.
[01:04:30.809 --> 01:04:36.869]  If you are drugged out on heroin in your bed asleep and the toddler goes out and drowns, that's negligence.
[01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:37.610]  You did nothing.
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:41.099]  But if you drowned your child, you did it on purpose.
[01:04:41.099 --> 01:04:42.519]  It's all on purpose.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:47.679]  And it's headline after headline like this.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:51.820]  And then they have the nerve to say Trump's going to kill the minorities.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.539]  Trump's going to use the military while they're gearing up for martial law publicly with the orders out of whoever's running the Biden administration.
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:02.360]  And saying they're going to have civil war conditions and saying they want armed uprisings.
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.139]  James Carville two weeks ago.
[01:05:04.599 --> 01:05:05.760]  Jamie Raskin, all of them.
[01:05:07.809 --> 01:05:10.449]  They're not planning on going quietly.
[01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:24.630]  And so as optimistic as I am and seeing the Great Awakening, as positive as I am, I'm not seeing enough concern from the brains around Trump.
[01:05:25.429 --> 01:05:27.429]  And I talk to these people all the time.
[01:05:27.989 --> 01:05:30.809]  And they go, yeah, that just sounds too negative to get into that.
[01:05:30.929 --> 01:05:32.030]  Well, it's being set up.
[01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:36.030]  It's too dark.
[01:05:38.019 --> 01:05:38.460]  Okay.
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:40.059]  Well, I'll do my job here.
[01:05:40.559 --> 01:05:47.400]  And the listeners that are activists, that are men and women in the arena, are going to share the live feed and the documents and the articles.
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.820]  And we're reaching conservatively with the main show.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.119]  20 million new people today.
[01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:53.880]  And the clips, I can't even count them.
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:57.599]  So, X is the game changer.
[01:05:58.670 --> 01:06:02.550]  I mean, we were reaching 30, 40 million people a day before they deplatformed me in 2017.
[01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:07.429]  Biggest talk radio show, biggest news show, English-speaking show in the world.
[01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:08.969]  Bigger than Rogue and all of it.
[01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:09.690]  That was on record.
[01:06:09.969 --> 01:06:11.170]  It's not about who's the biggest.
[01:06:11.369 --> 01:06:13.110]  It was we were covering the most accurate information.
[01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:14.349]  People were hungry for it.
[01:06:14.469 --> 01:06:16.929]  And they crushed us down to our radio stations.
[01:06:16.929 --> 01:06:19.030]  Took me off the whole internet except for Infowars.com.
[01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:20.130]  Tried to shut that down.
[01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:24.150]  We were probably crushed down to 5 million listeners a day.
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.400]  But that was like the 300.
[01:06:27.119 --> 01:06:34.400]  And now we've, thanks to you spreading the word, roared back to...
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.239]  We've had some days in the last month.
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:41.820]  50, 60 million viewers on X alone.
[01:06:42.019 --> 01:06:42.840]  People see the number.
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:43.280]  It's there.
[01:06:45.519 --> 01:06:48.599]  Then they false report us, try to block us all, pull their scams.
[01:06:48.659 --> 01:06:50.320]  Not X, but the Democrat Party.
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:51.539]  Manipulate the aisle.
[01:06:51.619 --> 01:06:53.480]  Oh, you just knocked us down to 20 million.
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.539]  Oh, you hurt us so bad.
[01:06:56.329 --> 01:07:00.949]  But they're fighting, trying to hold a beach ball underwater because the Streisand effect kicks in.
[01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:05.150]  People want to know what it is they're not supposed to know.
[01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:10.010]  They say curiosity killed the cat.
[01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:12.889]  I say curiosity is one of the most important things in the universe.
[01:07:13.869 --> 01:07:15.710]  What is it they don't want you to know?
[01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:22.429]  They want to just sit up there and say, there's no illegals voting, and then I show you all the federal rulings where they say illegals can vote.
[01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:33.570]  And the Texas ruling a month ago, yeah, you can vote with a non-citizen ID. They can't stand up against the hard, hot lights of truth.
[01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:45.949]  Just like cockroaches, you go in to get a glass of water in the kitchen at 3 a.m., and you flip the light on, and there's a bunch of cockroaches eating a piece of pie that you forgot to throw in the trash can.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.940]  That's all we are is a big light bulb.
[01:07:52.079 --> 01:07:52.360]  Bloop!
[01:07:52.519 --> 01:07:53.440]  My job is so easy.
[01:07:54.019 --> 01:07:55.460]  I can sit here and I've already done it.
[01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:59.519]  I can show you 50 evidences of election fraud right now.
[01:08:00.239 --> 01:08:01.139]  But you see it.
[01:08:01.219 --> 01:08:01.559]  It's everywhere.
[01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:04.119]  And that's how you know we're winning.
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:16.359]  We've gone from five, six years ago where 95% of the hardcore reports exposing globalist crimes and deep state activities were us.
[01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:21.310]  We're breaking half of them now.
[01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:23.510]  I love that.
[01:08:24.029 --> 01:08:25.970]  I love it.
[01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:31.689]  And as soon as it gets to 99%, I'm retired.
[01:08:32.489 --> 01:08:34.189]  You won't be seeing me no more.
[01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:36.750]  Because I got a lot of stuff I want to do.
[01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:39.569]  But we're a long way from that.
[01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:42.890]  But that's when I'm saying how far we've come.
[01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:43.850]  Because this looks negative.
[01:08:44.029 --> 01:08:45.029]  People tune in, they get depressed.
[01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:46.069]  Some tune in, they get fired up.
[01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:47.050]  It's all your perspective.
[01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:48.069]  I'm very fired up.
[01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:50.109]  I want your morale to be high.
[01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:52.829]  But I also want you to know, yeah, we're winning this fight.
[01:08:53.369 --> 01:08:54.609]  And we've got the initiative.
[01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:59.829]  But if we don't keep the gas turned on high and the pedals slam down to the metal and balls to the walls...
[01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:03.890]  This is a death battle.
[01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:05.289]  This is existential.
[01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:06.189]  This is urgent.
[01:09:06.409 --> 01:09:08.550]  This is maximum danger.
[01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:10.369]  This is game time.
[01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:11.210]  This is history.
[01:09:11.329 --> 01:09:12.289]  This is the crossroads.
[01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:16.649]  We've already passed the point of return, so you better decide what side you're on.
[01:09:16.689 --> 01:09:29.270]  Like I told Zuckerberg over and over again six months ago, I said, you better come out and apologize for helping steal the 2020 election, and you better say you're at least going to get out of politics, and you better do it.
[01:09:30.439 --> 01:09:31.819]  Or we're going to hold you responsible.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.199]  And I didn't threaten him bodily.
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:36.439]  I said, when we get in, you're going to get in a lot of trouble.
[01:09:36.899 --> 01:09:39.100]  And I said, by the way, here's just an example.
[01:09:40.539 --> 01:09:41.800]  I love Kauai, Hawaii.
[01:09:41.979 --> 01:09:43.199]  If I could live anywhere, I'd be there.
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.520]  Go there every year at least.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.479]  Been there for many years.
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:46.340]  Decades.
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:50.819]  And the Hawaiians love me, and the people really awake there, and they're great people.
[01:09:50.939 --> 01:09:55.000]  They know there's basically, they never got out from under being a governorship, a territory.
[01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:57.319]  And they're pissed about the New World Order.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:59.500]  But it's not just the Hawaiians.
[01:09:59.739 --> 01:10:01.439]  Most of the natives aren't just Hawaiian.
[01:10:01.619 --> 01:10:03.600]  It's a mix of Asian folks that live there.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:06.880]  And then the locals that live there that are white for a long time.
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:10.140]  You can't go in a restaurant.
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:12.020]  You can't rent a fishing boat.
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:13.439]  You can't walk into a hotel.
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.420]  You can't have the maid service cleaning your hotel room that barely speaks English.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:18.880]  We like your show.
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:22.140]  We want to kill Zuckerberg.
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.460]  And I'm like, well, let's not kill him.
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:24.239]  Let's, you know...
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:31.699]  Literally, you're out fishing, you're out snorkeling, and the Japanese guy that's fifth generation is talking about how much they want to get Zuckerberg.
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.000]  And then you go meet with the Hawaiian chief, who's the real chief.
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:35.979]  That's all they're talking about, Zuckerberg.
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:40.060]  And then you run into people that are working on his bunker, and all they're talking about how they want to get Zuckerberg.
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:41.960]  And then you run into security guys that hate Zuckerberg.
[01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:43.760]  And it's just, as I said, Zuckerberg.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:49.880]  Of course, Zuckerberg knows how hated he is, because I've been going there many years, and it's just more and more and more to the point of, it gets annoying.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:57.420]  I'm sitting there on the beach, Watching my daughter playing the surf, my seven-year-old, and people won't leave me alone saying we're going to get him.
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.300]  The tourists are saying, where does he live?
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:00.899]  We hate him.
[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:04.640]  I mean, that's the equivalent of the villagers with the torches and the pitchforks.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.220]  And I said, you better roll over, jackass.
[01:11:10.359 --> 01:11:13.460]  And we had Ivan Raikland on, and he said, you better signal.
[01:11:13.619 --> 01:11:15.060]  And we listed a big group of people.
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:17.699]  A month later, he rolls over.
[01:11:18.359 --> 01:11:19.659]  That's a good sign.
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:23.239]  We don't want to put you in prison, Zuckerberg.
[01:11:23.399 --> 01:11:28.359]  We don't want the locals when society breaks down in martial law to come know that your house has got the food.
[01:11:28.939 --> 01:11:31.539]  It's like a big flashing red sign during collapse.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:32.300]  Come get me.
[01:11:33.899 --> 01:11:35.020]  Your stupid bunker.
[01:11:35.439 --> 01:11:37.439]  It's a fancy Egyptian tomb.
[01:11:38.399 --> 01:11:39.380]  And he rolled over.
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:43.100]  Doesn't mean we can trust him in the dark or even turn our backs on him, but...
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:45.560]  That's where we are.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:46.960]  Get ready for the victory.
[01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:48.380]  Elon Musk is all in.
[01:11:48.579 --> 01:11:51.760]  All the most popular talk show hosts are anti-globalists now.
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:57.680]  Populist parties are being elected everywhere.
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:04.979]  And it's front and center that the globalists think we're garbage.
[01:12:05.399 --> 01:12:16.449]  And they hate our police, and they hate our military, and they hate anybody that's competent because they hate anybody that they can imagine Could ever get behind the people and bring them to justice.
[01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:29.210]  So, I want to play you something that I had a chance to see days ago that they released this morning on Tulsi Gabbard's X account.
[01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:34.409]  And the great folks at the Maha Alliance put this together, Del Big Tree, and they don't want credit, I'm giving credit.
[01:12:34.729 --> 01:12:36.130]  And the great Mickey Willis.
[01:12:36.329 --> 01:12:41.449]  And I mean, this looks better than a Disney production, but it's not the production quality, it's the content quality.
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.779]  Of this new...
[01:12:44.779 --> 01:12:48.720]  Tulsi Gabbards ad.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:56.800]  And we posted it on Real Alex Jones on X. I want you to share it.
[01:12:57.159 --> 01:12:58.899]  And it just shows...
[01:12:58.899 --> 01:13:02.779]  The decency of Trump and Gabbards and RFK Jr.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.460]  And the substance of what they stand for.
[01:13:05.979 --> 01:13:06.619]  And...
[01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:13.510]  What we're facing and how clear this choice is.
[01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:15.550]  So go to my X account.
[01:13:15.689 --> 01:13:16.649]  Go to Gabber's X account.
[01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:17.930]  Go to the Maha Alliance account.
[01:13:18.489 --> 01:13:19.409]  Get this.
[01:13:19.829 --> 01:13:21.029]  Post it on your own site.
[01:13:21.170 --> 01:13:21.890]  Don't just retweet it.
[01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:24.409]  Retweet it and re-upload it.
[01:13:24.970 --> 01:13:26.729]  Because then it gets even more people.
[01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:29.609]  And then Elon Musk will put it out, I would say, by tonight.
[01:13:31.090 --> 01:13:32.270]  He's one that paid for these.
[01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:35.109]  And you compare this ad...
[01:13:36.119 --> 01:13:38.760]  To the ads the Democrats put out, it's night and day.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:43.420]  Everything they say is a lie, and everything, if you study this ad, is true.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:48.220]  So this is what they didn't tell you about Donald Trump.
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:14:01.920]  This is the real Donald Trump from a woman of just amazing, on-record, Courage and commitment to this country and wholesomeness and decency.
[01:14:02.399 --> 01:14:05.579]  And you see all the good people congregating to fight the evil.
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.760]  You see all the evil congregating to fight us.
[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:13.600]  And we see the alliance of freedom just energizing, getting stronger by the minute.
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:16.460]  This is such an exciting time to be alive.
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:18.199]  Here's the ad.
[01:14:25.069 --> 01:14:26.229]  Tulsi Gabbard.
[01:14:29.850 --> 01:14:30.449]  Aloha.
[01:14:35.989 --> 01:14:39.109]  I joined the Democratic Party over 20 years ago.
[01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:54.109]  I was 21 years old in Hawaii, and at that time, it welcomed people from all different backgrounds, different views, celebrated free speech, and actually defended those whose speech was being attacked, even if they disagreed with their views.
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:03.760]  It was a party that stood up for the little guy and represented our values of freedom and liberty in America.
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:10.439]  I left the Democrat party because now it stands for the exact opposite of all of those things.
[01:15:10.899 --> 01:15:12.659]  Free speech is not an absolute.
[01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:20.850]  Social media sites, they are speaking to millions of people without oversight or regulation, and that has to stop.
[01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:38.090]  I never would have imagined, as an American and as a soldier, that we would live in a country in my lifetime where we would feel like we have to self-censor what we say, that we couldn't criticize our own government for fear of them labeling us as a domestic terrorist.
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:46.159]  We are closer to the brink of World War III and nuclear war today than we ever have been before.
[01:15:47.159 --> 01:15:50.979]  Directly because of the Harris-Biden administration's foreign policy.
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:56.920]  Too many Americans are struggling just to afford the basic necessities of life.
[01:15:57.319 --> 01:16:05.939]  No matter how many times we've heard Kamala Harris and Joe Biden over these last four years tout and celebrate how Bidenomics has been great for America.
[01:16:06.819 --> 01:16:08.899]  America's economy is strong.
[01:16:09.159 --> 01:16:14.600]  Polls consistently show that a majority of the American people disapprove of the president's handling of the economy.
[01:16:14.739 --> 01:16:15.260]  Guess what?
[01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:16.670]  It's working.
[01:16:16.949 --> 01:16:23.229]  Over half of Americans earning a six-figure salary report that they're actually living paycheck to paycheck.
[01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:24.729]  Bidenomics is working.
[01:16:24.909 --> 01:16:25.890]  It is actually working.
[01:16:26.050 --> 01:16:30.789]  The number of homeless people on the streets and in shelters across the U.S. increased significantly this year.
[01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:32.430]  Bidenomics is working.
[01:16:33.289 --> 01:16:42.970]  It's almost as though they're speaking from an ivory tower saying how great they are and patting themselves on the back while people are struggling for crumbs on the streets.
[01:16:44.239 --> 01:16:47.520]  This election really isn't about the left versus the right.
[01:16:47.779 --> 01:16:49.560]  It's about choosing.
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:55.880]  We the people choosing our government and the choice between freedom versus tyranny.
[01:16:56.039 --> 01:17:03.380]  The Department of Defense, under Biden's authority, quietly codified its right to deploy lethal force against its own citizens on American soil.
[01:17:03.859 --> 01:17:09.739]  I'm proud to endorse Donald Trump in this election because he is our best hope.
[01:17:12.989 --> 01:17:30.770]  Specifically because of the leadership that President Trump has brought to transform the Republican Party and bring it back to the party of the people, the party of equality, the party that was founded to fight against and end slavery in this country.
[01:17:30.810 --> 01:17:39.159]  It is the party of common sense and the party that is led by a president Who has the courage and strength to fight for peace.
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:39.420]  Mr.
[01:17:39.539 --> 01:17:44.119]  Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to ever set foot inside North Korea yesterday.
[01:17:44.439 --> 01:17:48.939]  And this is why they will do everything possible to try to destroy him.
[01:17:49.079 --> 01:17:56.779]  Because this man has the courage to take them on and root out the deep rot of corruption in Washington.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:06.720]  My message to my fellow Americans, regardless of your political affiliation, now is the time for us to stand together to save our country.
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:14.960]  A vote for President Trump is a vote for a big open tent party that welcomes people from all backgrounds and all walks of life.
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:24.939]  A vote for President Trump is a vote to express our deep love for our country and our appreciation for our God-given rights and freedoms enshrined in the Constitution.
[01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:36.689]  A vote for President Trump is a vote for secure borders and safe communities, and a vote for President Trump is a vote for peace here in America and around the world.
[01:18:36.909 --> 01:18:37.850]  Thank you so much.
[01:19:06.939 --> 01:19:07.739]  You can feel it.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.939]  We have massive initiative.
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.840]  We have turned the tide.
[01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:19.640]  We are like Beowulf in the ancient Norse fables, have Grendel by the arm, and we're going to rip it out of the socket.
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:26.680]  Does that mean we're offering some utopia like the left claims they're going to offer?
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:26.979]  No.
[01:19:27.539 --> 01:19:30.239]  But not a system designed to make you weak.
[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:31.960]  Not a system designed to make you poor.
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:35.319]  Not a system that punishes meritocracy but rewards it.
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:42.100]  That's the system we're bringing back, the system that's the newest system, the best system that everybody tried to imitate.
[01:19:42.359 --> 01:19:48.600]  And then the globalists took over America and have to run America down because they don't want that as an example, a city on the shining hill.
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:50.979]  A shining city on the hill.
[01:19:54.939 --> 01:19:55.880]  That's where we are.
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:58.359]  And we're reclaiming our destiny.
[01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:02.020]  All right, let me hit this right now because this is a big deal.
[01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:05.270]  It's like it's Groundhog Day.
[01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:16.050]  We've had all these congressional hearings the last few years about weaponization and the FBI and the feds and the CIA domestically, illegally controlling information, having hundreds of millions of posts demoted or taken down or blocked.
[01:20:16.510 --> 01:20:21.689]  Congressional hearings first targeting me eight years ago that I'm a Russian with no damn evidence of it.
[01:20:24.409 --> 01:20:28.789]  And Turning the system loose on me.
[01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:31.329]  I didn't whine and say, oh, I'm a victim.
[01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:34.390]  I said, no, I'm a target because I'm effective at fighting these people.
[01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:35.270]  But I said, you're next.
[01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:37.670]  And now it's all out in the open.
[01:20:37.829 --> 01:20:38.550]  It came out in federal court.
[01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:40.350]  The FBI ran all the fake lawsuits against me.
[01:20:40.409 --> 01:20:41.949]  The CIA was involved with the media.
[01:20:42.569 --> 01:20:43.449]  All came out.
[01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:48.069]  And now Tucker Carlson does whole shows on it and gets 100 million views.
[01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:49.250]  How do they like that?
[01:20:49.409 --> 01:20:53.189]  See, their lies work at first, but they rot quickly.
[01:20:53.189 --> 01:20:54.029]  They fall apart.
[01:20:55.829 --> 01:20:56.810]  And so we see these headlines.
[01:20:56.989 --> 01:21:00.149]  The Biden-Harris administration wasted nearly a billion dollars on misinformation.
[01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:09.729]  And the Brownstone Institute legal group goes from the angle that, oh, they claim they were fighting disinfo, but it didn't work.
[01:21:09.930 --> 01:21:12.850]  No, they call anything true or they don't like disinfo.
[01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:14.470]  Just like this headline.
[01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:15.390]  This is a big problem.
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:18.680]  I see them everywhere.
[01:21:19.079 --> 01:21:22.479]  Five reasons Kamala did nothing to stop 10 million illegals.
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:23.359]  They brought them in.
[01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:24.319]  They paid to bring them.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:25.920]  The UN NGOs ran it.
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:29.380]  Stop saying the left are incompetent idiots.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:43.619]  They're evil, carrying out a globalist agenda, the same thing in every Western country, to break the will and break the back of the countries under Cloward and Piven, to crash the society and the money and the infrastructure to bring in their new system.
[01:21:45.159 --> 01:21:47.260]  It's totalitarian communism 101.
[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:58.199]  So this big article goes over the total admission of fraud, but comes out of perspective of, oh, they didn't stop the disinfo.
[01:21:59.439 --> 01:22:00.859]  They didn't stop it.
[01:22:00.979 --> 01:22:01.800]  They're the disinfo.
[01:22:02.079 --> 01:22:15.159]  And then you see this, and I told Joe last week, talked to him last Thursday before Trump came in, I said, you know, you gotta get this on X. Because I know his deals are with Spotify and YouTube.
[01:22:15.159 --> 01:22:16.060]  He's back on YouTube.
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:18.760]  You know, his choice to leave it four years ago.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.399]  That was his first guest when he left it.
[01:22:22.439 --> 01:22:23.079]  Here in Austin.
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:28.460]  And I said, they're going to shadow ban it.
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:29.460]  You won't be able to search it.
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:30.659]  That's the standard deal they do to Trump.
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:33.420]  You know, when they shot him for a month and a half, they wouldn't even show it if you look for it.
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:40.119]  And of course, they shadow banned it, and you couldn't search it, and it's all admitted, and YouTube says that.
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:40.939]  They can do whatever they want.
[01:22:41.539 --> 01:22:45.319]  Total election meddling, and so then they put it on X yesterday.
[01:22:46.659 --> 01:22:53.560]  But again, do you think they're going to stop with Joe Rogan and Trump, or J.D. Vance, who's here right now?
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.500]  I think they just finished taping down the road.
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:57.939]  Joe's studio's not on that way.
[01:23:01.739 --> 01:23:03.600]  This is everybody's problem.
[01:23:05.970 --> 01:23:06.470]  Look at this.
[01:23:06.569 --> 01:23:09.189]  Wikipedia editors officially deemed Trump a fascist.
[01:23:09.289 --> 01:23:12.829]  And Musk put a tweet out last night saying, Wikipedia is broken.
[01:23:13.010 --> 01:23:16.770]  It would have had to ever work or been a truthful thing to be broken.
[01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:20.449]  It's always twisted information and pushed a global agenda.
[01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:21.890]  Now it's just cartoonish.
[01:23:21.989 --> 01:23:23.289]  They go, yeah, he's officially a Hitler.
[01:23:25.149 --> 01:23:29.250]  He's a fascist because, you know, he raises his fists.
[01:23:32.399 --> 01:23:38.300]  It's a joke, and they use Wikipedia to train the AI. Garbage in, garbage out.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:43.220]  And here's Elon Musk tweet, Wikipedia is broken.
[01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:46.239]  Uh, no.
[01:23:47.239 --> 01:23:50.260]  And I keep hitting this theme not to try to police people, I'm just saying.
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:53.779]  They didn't get rid of the border by accident, it's not incompetence.
[01:23:53.939 --> 01:23:55.420]  They didn't censor by accident.
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:58.039]  They didn't do any of this by accident.
[01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:02.300]  It's all been, by design, on record, criminal premeditated actions.
[01:24:03.859 --> 01:24:06.460]  We got a lot more coming up.
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:07.739]  Special guests, huge.
[01:24:08.119 --> 01:24:09.520]  Dale Comstock in studio.
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:11.619]  Next hour, stay with us.

[01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:24.789]  It's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you wanna fight?
[01:25:24.970 --> 01:25:27.170]  You better believe you got one!
[01:25:28.949 --> 01:25:34.250]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:25:52.849 --> 01:25:54.710]  I've been on air over 30 years.
[01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:55.529]  Since I was 20.
[01:25:57.350 --> 01:26:00.109]  And nothing compares the time we're in.
[01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:04.430]  Intellectually, spiritually, politically.
[01:26:04.829 --> 01:26:20.000]  I mean, I'm just here looking at All over the world, not just in America, the pedophile rings, the narcotics trafficking, the human trafficking, the corruption, the evil, the poison shots,
[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:25.300]  the globalists not paying taxes, it's all coming out.
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:31.119]  The censorship, the control, the collusion, their plans for global cashless society.
[01:26:33.409 --> 01:26:36.689]  And it's not like it's some new fad that's popular to know about freedom.
[01:26:36.909 --> 01:26:38.270]  This isn't going to go away.
[01:26:38.569 --> 01:26:42.470]  This was predicted by historians and sociologists and anthropologists.
[01:26:42.710 --> 01:26:48.310]  We know there's an 87-year, 88-year, depending on which map you look at, cycle.
[01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:49.550]  And this is a fourth turning.
[01:26:49.630 --> 01:26:50.710]  This is a mega turning.
[01:26:52.489 --> 01:26:54.989]  This is a big, big deal.
[01:26:56.260 --> 01:27:01.460]  And the globalists wanted to bring in their total control during this time of change.
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:05.300]  Instead, humanity is not being caught completely flat-footed.
[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:07.359]  We're not in the best position, but we're at least not asleep.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.180]  And it's saying no.
[01:27:09.239 --> 01:27:12.420]  And the growth curve of understanding is going straight up.
[01:27:13.979 --> 01:27:19.039]  That's why I tell the agencies and the corporations and the people in the system...
[01:27:20.829 --> 01:27:26.970]  For your own self-preservation, you don't want to be in this dystopic great reset where they make us all poor for social control.
[01:27:28.649 --> 01:27:31.050]  And it's the right thing to do, of course, and God's watching.
[01:27:31.850 --> 01:27:36.789]  So it's so easy now to join Team Humanity.
[01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:40.270]  One of my interviews with Elon Musk, two and a half hours long.
[01:27:40.930 --> 01:27:50.750]  He was talking about the death cult, the depopulation agenda, because it's out in the open, how he'd meet with the heads of Google and they'd say, you're too pro-human, you're a natalist, which means you're pro-family, pro-child.
[01:27:52.770 --> 01:27:56.989]  And he said, you know, I don't know what we call this movement, and I said, we call it Team Humanity.
[01:27:57.890 --> 01:27:59.609]  He goes, yes, yes, Team Humanity.
[01:28:00.970 --> 01:28:03.930]  And that got some traction, but not enough.
[01:28:06.670 --> 01:28:08.909]  Because for most people, well, of course we're pro-human.
[01:28:09.069 --> 01:28:10.430]  Well, I mean, do you read the New York Times?
[01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:11.590]  Do you watch Discovery Channel?
[01:28:11.729 --> 01:28:19.189]  Do you hear them saying humans are bad and that we're going to be replaced and the WEF officially saying the future is not human?
[01:28:19.329 --> 01:28:21.170]  I mean, just type in WEF, future is not human.
[01:28:22.689 --> 01:28:38.090]  They are really pushing a horrible, anti-human, dystopic system while they claim populists and conservatives and natalists We're going to kill everybody and we want martial law and we want to punish our political enemies and we want to censor and we want to control.
[01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:41.770]  And then you sit back and you look at what the New World Order is doing everywhere.
[01:28:43.909 --> 01:28:47.170]  And more than 80 million people over the lockdowns in the third world.
[01:28:47.289 --> 01:28:47.789]  80 million.
[01:28:48.010 --> 01:28:49.789]  Normally it's about 15 million a year starving to death.
[01:28:50.050 --> 01:28:50.670]  You have the extra numbers.
[01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:51.689]  80 plus million.
[01:28:51.850 --> 01:28:52.529]  That's a UN number.
[01:28:52.649 --> 01:28:53.010]  It's accurate.
[01:28:53.670 --> 01:28:59.640]  Starved to death, they said, from COVID. No, from the lockdowns of COVID. You thought we had year-long lockdowns.
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:02.560]  They had three-year lockdowns because the IMF World Bank controls their countries.
[01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:04.659]  That's the military.
[01:29:06.119 --> 01:29:10.979]  When I say the military, you think of the military as helicopters and troops and all of this.
[01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:12.560]  That's the old military.
[01:29:14.989 --> 01:29:29.670]  The new system, the soft kill system, is the administrative system cutting off the energy, cutting off the food, cutting off the fertilizer, undermining society, bankrupting the systems, sabotaging the physical militaries, the classical militaries.
[01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:31.750]  That's the real attack.
[01:29:34.210 --> 01:29:44.010]  I was talking to some military folks just the other day, and I was saying, and of course they want to stop Trump and stop others because they want to carry out the depopulation.
[01:29:45.739 --> 01:29:48.939]  And they're like, you mean with another even more deadly bile release?
[01:29:49.039 --> 01:29:58.020]  And I went, well, yeah, down the road, but they want a slow cook to normalize sterilizing and poisoning people.
[01:29:58.199 --> 01:29:59.840]  That's how you really hit somebody.
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:04.180]  And obviously, I'm stating something that's 101 about the New World Order.
[01:30:04.539 --> 01:30:11.760]  A real sinister attack that Is covert and hits you from different angles and moves slowly.
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:15.439]  Use the Dune analogy of the slow blade penetrates the shield.
[01:30:17.359 --> 01:30:29.659]  So while we're all here waiting for the big attack, waiting for the Nazis to come marching in and we'll kick their ass with the UN blue helmets, the UN treaties, the UN regulations, the UNESCO transhumanist movement is here.
[01:30:30.239 --> 01:30:31.800]  It's controlling the schools.
[01:30:33.090 --> 01:30:34.829]  It's controlling the dinosaur media.
[01:30:35.090 --> 01:30:36.189]  It's surveilling.
[01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:37.149]  That's the key to censorship.
[01:30:37.369 --> 01:30:38.489]  It's not just the censorship.
[01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:40.489]  It's the surveillance that goes with it.
[01:30:40.750 --> 01:30:42.689]  The Ministry of Truth they tried to set up three years ago.
[01:30:42.949 --> 01:30:44.789]  It's already operating, but they gave it a name.
[01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:46.710]  Their disinformation bureau.
[01:30:52.029 --> 01:30:56.909]  And people are like, look, the disinformation bureau said that the COVID vaccine works 100% of the time.
[01:30:57.050 --> 01:30:57.710]  They were wrong.
[01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:00.029]  They're the dissent.
[01:31:00.130 --> 01:31:01.210]  No, they're not wrong.
[01:31:01.449 --> 01:31:02.789]  They were lying on purpose.
[01:31:02.810 --> 01:31:07.850]  And I keep restating that and restating that because I talk to senators and congressmen and people all the time.
[01:31:07.970 --> 01:31:09.729]  And they just say, I don't get these leftists.
[01:31:09.829 --> 01:31:10.890]  They're just so stupid.
[01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:13.489]  They're not stupid.
[01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:14.569]  They have an agenda.
[01:31:14.770 --> 01:31:23.289]  Their minions are stupid, but you've got to understand it's an organized, scientific, post-human, transhumanist takeover.
[01:31:23.449 --> 01:31:30.710]  And I will just hammer that and hammer that and hammer that until it becomes the main issue, which it's basically there.
[01:31:31.289 --> 01:31:32.449]  Thanks to Elon Musk.
[01:31:35.449 --> 01:31:52.159]  And there's nothing more satisfying than talking to folks And sitting there, prominent people and regular folks, everybody, and to hear people sit there and tell me about the new world order and tell me about the plans,
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:52.899]  and I love it.
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:53.979]  I'm just like, tell me more.
[01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:55.300]  Oh, really?
[01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:57.239]  They're doing that?
[01:31:57.380 --> 01:32:00.680]  Oh, they add a hormone to the tetanus shot that sterilizes women.
[01:32:00.939 --> 01:32:01.199]  Really?
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:02.859]  Didn't know that.
[01:32:03.619 --> 01:32:05.020]  Thank you for telling me.
[01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:07.760]  Oh, fluoride causes lower IQ and infertility?
[01:32:07.899 --> 01:32:08.760]  I didn't know that.
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:10.420]  Thank you!
[01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:14.720]  Because that's when you know you've really been effective.
[01:32:16.449 --> 01:32:33.810]  So I just keep coming to you with the positive news that no matter what happens, whether they kill Trump, which we don't want to happen, or whether they steal the election, and I'm not saying that's going to happen, though they're trying, it doesn't matter as long as you know we're winning, that God's on our side, and this war may take 10 more years or 50 more years,
[01:32:33.869 --> 01:32:35.010]  or maybe we win right now.
[01:32:35.229 --> 01:32:36.470]  It doesn't matter.
[01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:40.449]  We never give up because the journey is the destination.
[01:32:41.869 --> 01:32:43.869]  This is all about doing the right thing.
[01:32:46.069 --> 01:32:49.310]  And educating people and also making fun of the tyrants and getting in their face.
[01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:50.569]  Like I said, day one.
[01:32:51.350 --> 01:33:00.390]  They put out thousands and thousands of articles saying Trump is Hitler because he's going to the Madison Square Garden where the Nazis in 1939, 85 years ago, had a rally.
[01:33:00.489 --> 01:33:01.170]  Hitler wasn't there.
[01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:02.090]  It was the American boon.
[01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:03.829]  That was the Nazi party in America.
[01:33:04.909 --> 01:33:10.850]  And everybody else from the Beatles to Elvis to the Rolling Stones to Metallica to the DNC, the RNC, they've all been there.
[01:33:11.170 --> 01:33:12.010]  It's ridiculous.
[01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:19.470]  To say that it's the same as saying, well, Hitler drinks water, Trump drinks water.
[01:33:19.810 --> 01:33:22.369]  Hitler has a car, Trump has a car.
[01:33:22.630 --> 01:33:24.850]  Hitler wears a jacket, Trump wears a jacket.
[01:33:26.050 --> 01:33:27.489]  So that got turned into a meme.
[01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:35.149]  But so much of this is just common sense and not letting the globalists dictate to you reality.
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:41.939]  So let's play a little clip that the Dilley meme team put together.
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:43.239]  You're Hitler.
[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:43.840]  Here it is.
[01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:53.449]  Like, Hitler breathed air, you breathed air, you're Hitler.
[01:33:53.949 --> 01:33:56.869]  Hitler drank water, you drink water, you're Hitler.
[01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:59.449]  Hitler ate food, you eat food, you're Hitler.
[01:33:59.770 --> 01:34:02.109]  Hitler drove a car, you drive a car, you're Hitler.
[01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:05.210]  Hitler took a dump, you take a dump, you're Hitler.
[01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:08.390]  Hitler brushes teeth, you brush your teeth, you're Hitler.
[01:34:08.789 --> 01:34:11.409]  Hitler wore sunglasses, you wore sunglasses, you're Hitler.
[01:34:12.109 --> 01:34:15.149]  Hell, I'm wearing aviator sunglasses right now, I guess that means I'm Joe Biden.
[01:34:20.729 --> 01:34:24.210]  Now, let's go to Tony Hinchcliffe, great fellow Austinite.
[01:34:25.170 --> 01:34:31.890]  And in fact, he'll be ten times bigger than ever because he didn't apologize about his joke when he was roasting everybody.
[01:34:32.569 --> 01:34:35.810]  But this is another reason they hate Tony Hinchcliffe.
[01:34:35.869 --> 01:34:36.189]  Here it is.
[01:34:36.979 --> 01:34:37.460]  Go ahead.
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:42.979]  Basically, I mean, like, they said shit like go back to, you know, Poland, all the normal shit.
[01:34:43.199 --> 01:34:44.380]  But you've never been to Poland?
[01:34:44.659 --> 01:34:45.960]  No, I'm from Ukraine.
[01:34:46.359 --> 01:34:47.979]  My ancestry is Ukrainian.
[01:34:48.579 --> 01:34:49.180]  Oh, wow.
[01:34:49.399 --> 01:34:50.739]  Way to get the crowd on your side.
[01:34:50.859 --> 01:34:53.859]  There's some uneducated idiots that are rooting for you now.
[01:34:54.779 --> 01:34:57.520]  Not realizing that that country's stealing our money.
[01:34:58.319 --> 01:34:59.260]  Yeah, they are.
[01:34:59.539 --> 01:34:59.819]  Yeah.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.420]  Oh, look at that pop from the crowd.
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:08.279]  Almost seems like we should stop donating to Needless Wars, am I correct?
[01:35:10.119 --> 01:35:14.180]  If only there was a candidate for that coming up in November.
[01:35:14.439 --> 01:35:15.079]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:15.819]  Do the right thing.
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:16.560]  Tell your friends.
[01:35:16.859 --> 01:35:18.880]  Anyway, uh...
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:20.640]  Aiden...
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:32.039]  Now, this is another bellwether issue as I'm giving you positive news today because I realized yesterday I got really dark and went down kind of the avenue if we fail.
[01:35:33.199 --> 01:35:36.140]  Very high potential of nuclear war, just total insanity.
[01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:45.600]  I was thinking I should come back today and talk about positive stuff mainly because really people need to know, and I think most of you know that, but for those that don't know, when I'm lecturing people, I'm really lecturing myself.
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.300]  This is all just Alex Jones talking to himself really.
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:56.579]  Now, some huge election news just broke so big that I'm processing in here for a minute before I get to it.
[01:35:56.779 --> 01:35:57.640]  It's that big.
[01:35:58.399 --> 01:36:02.199]  And I'm having an explosion of thoughts here.
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:06.000]  Wow.
[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:08.180]  This is the biggest yet.
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:09.359]  I mean, this is...
[01:36:09.359 --> 01:36:12.439]  I'm actually speechless right now.
[01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:17.390]  Not because I couldn't talk.
[01:36:17.550 --> 01:36:18.850]  I just really want to nail this.
[01:36:21.170 --> 01:36:22.670]  God, it's all hiding in plain view.
[01:36:22.789 --> 01:36:23.630]  This is so insane.
[01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:27.069]  There's so many angles to this next big thing that just dropped.
[01:36:27.329 --> 01:36:27.609]  Wow.
[01:36:28.329 --> 01:36:32.090]  And we knew this, and MTG reported this two weeks ago.
[01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:36.510]  And then it was all confirmed in newspapers around the country.
[01:36:38.569 --> 01:36:42.170]  Now they've been caught red-handed flipping the votes.
[01:36:42.409 --> 01:36:42.949]  Oh my God.
[01:36:43.899 --> 01:36:45.039]  And they just admitted it.
[01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:49.399]  The main Soros operative just did.
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:51.699]  So I am...
[01:36:51.699 --> 01:36:52.479]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:36:52.659 --> 01:36:56.880]  In these quickenings in history and you're living in one, you'll never live in something like this again.
[01:36:57.260 --> 01:36:57.659]  Probably.
[01:36:57.819 --> 01:37:00.880]  I mean, there's a hyper-quicketing though with all the technology, so maybe we will.
[01:37:01.119 --> 01:37:07.239]  But, you know, Lenin said there are times when nothing happens in decades and then weeks where decades happen.
[01:37:07.399 --> 01:37:08.359]  You're there, sweethearts.
[01:37:09.319 --> 01:37:11.340]  And in my view, I don't think that's a view.
[01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:12.260]  I think everybody agrees with me.
[01:37:13.239 --> 01:37:13.640]  Uh...
[01:37:19.329 --> 01:37:19.689]  Wow.
[01:37:22.289 --> 01:37:23.489]  Wow is all I can say.
[01:37:23.829 --> 01:37:27.449]  But back to the Tony Hitchcliffe point.
[01:37:29.369 --> 01:37:37.939]  I don't go to a lot of concerts because I'm busy and tired at night or whatever, but I... I do go to comedy clubs, and I'm friends with Joe Rogan.
[01:37:38.039 --> 01:37:39.760]  He's owned some other ships, so I go there quite often.
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:40.520]  He's very nice.
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:41.699]  He's a little VIP booth.
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:42.079]  It's great.
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:44.220]  And I get to meet all the people.
[01:37:44.399 --> 01:37:53.560]  And I've known Tony for eight years or so since he's been living here in Austin and gone on his comedy thing a lot there at the Vulcan Gas Company and then over at the other place.
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:56.100]  And so I get to know these guys.
[01:37:56.819 --> 01:38:01.880]  And before Joe moved here four years ago, I went to comedy maybe twice a year.
[01:38:02.670 --> 01:38:07.930]  Because there's so many comedians here now, I probably go every couple weeks to not just his club, but others.
[01:38:08.590 --> 01:38:12.310]  And when he moved here four years ago, I started going to comedy every few weeks.
[01:38:12.789 --> 01:38:15.029]  I was like, everybody's anti-New World Order.
[01:38:15.149 --> 01:38:18.130]  Black, white, Asian, Arab, old, young, female.
[01:38:18.369 --> 01:38:20.270]  You see a lot of the comedians here on air.
[01:38:20.770 --> 01:38:22.829]  And not just Tim Dillon, but the list goes on and on.
[01:38:24.119 --> 01:38:26.359]  And Joe said, oh yeah, they're completely awake to the New World Order.
[01:38:26.479 --> 01:38:42.319]  And we're talking about arenas with 10, 20, 30,000 people get filled up with comedians talking all about the New World Order, which again is a major benchmark for Of how amazing this is.
[01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:46.619]  Because that's, you know, really the cutting edge of culture would be something like comedy.
[01:38:46.819 --> 01:38:51.899]  And all the attempts to censor it and control it in the last decade is what's blown up in the system's face.
[01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:55.100]  So again, you want to be canceled by the system.
[01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:56.640]  You want to be attacked by it.
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:59.399]  Because that which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[01:38:59.619 --> 01:39:01.800]  Though they are putting people in prison and they are killing people.
[01:39:02.119 --> 01:39:06.199]  But the problem is there's so many more people popping up.
[01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:08.890]  Because I bet on humanity.
[01:39:09.130 --> 01:39:14.510]  I believed decades ago that people were rolling over because they were asleep and couldn't believe bad things were happening.
[01:39:14.630 --> 01:39:16.350]  And it turns out I was right about the majority of people.
[01:39:16.630 --> 01:39:21.510]  The globalists thought all their intimidation was working on people, but it wasn't working.
[01:39:21.710 --> 01:39:27.069]  Now that people are awake, messing with people, I'd say 9 out of 10 pisses them off.
[01:39:27.689 --> 01:39:28.829]  Don't work too good.
[01:39:30.069 --> 01:39:32.569]  So that's where we are.
[01:39:32.670 --> 01:39:34.329]  And that was the news I wanted to say about comedy.
[01:39:36.039 --> 01:39:36.859]  Let me do this.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.119]  I was going to play this clip anyways.
[01:39:38.359 --> 01:39:39.060]  It's very important.
[01:39:40.479 --> 01:39:43.960]  And it's Bill Ackerman on X and how important it is.
[01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:44.960]  Let's play this short clip.
[01:39:46.539 --> 01:39:59.399]  And then I'm going to come back with the most insane news yet in the election concerning fraud.
[01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:01.939]  Here's Ackerman.
[01:40:02.789 --> 01:40:06.989]  Well, you need neutral spaces in media.
[01:40:07.630 --> 01:40:08.850]  Bill's an optimist, by the way.
[01:40:09.989 --> 01:40:15.369]  Neutral spaces in media where you can counteract the...
[01:40:15.369 --> 01:40:19.550]  I don't want to use the word misinformation because that itself has problems.
[01:40:19.909 --> 01:40:28.329]  Look, I don't want to sit here and just be an advertisement for X. But what's interesting, you know, someone writes a profile of me in some media form.
[01:40:28.449 --> 01:40:29.069]  I can...
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:38.479]  You know, within an hour of that article coming out, I can, you know, very specifically fact check, rebut, address the issue, as could obviously any candidate for office.
[01:40:39.319 --> 01:40:48.319]  You know, prior to X being sort of this neutral platform, you know, you send the Times a beg them for a correction, right?
[01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:53.359]  And in a few weeks on, quote-unquote, page 43 in a place no one would read, the correction would appear.
[01:40:53.819 --> 01:41:07.220]  And I think the more the public has lost confidence in kind of conventional media, the more they're going to look to empirical voices in podcasting and kind of citizen journalism on X. And I do think that's a powerful counterpoint.
[01:41:07.819 --> 01:41:21.380]  You know, the most powerful moment for many people, actually one of them for me, I truly believed that Trump had said that the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists were very fine people, were among the very fine people who were protesting.
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:29.279]  And it takes about two minutes to actually watch what he said to realize that he said precisely the opposite, that he condemned.
[01:41:29.939 --> 01:41:34.460]  He said, I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists when he's talking about very fine people.
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:40.020]  And that's the moment when you realize, oh my god, I really have been misled by the media.
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:54.100]  You look at the 60 minutes excerpting that was done of Kamlo, and you realize how much you can be manipulated, particularly by taped And excerpted media.
[01:41:54.380 --> 01:42:03.979]  So I really, if I'm trying to get to the truth, I want to hear the voice of the candidate untaped, unscripted, without the teleprompter.
[01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:07.819]  Of course, Ackerman's very respected and has made hundreds of dead-on predictions.
[01:42:08.119 --> 01:42:11.899]  He also said Kamala Harris will probably result in the end-of-the-world nuclear war.
[01:42:12.079 --> 01:42:12.800]  Another clip.
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:18.640]  But let me now cover this breaking news.
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:27.119]  Now, we reported this first with MTG two Fridays ago.
[01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:39.060]  And since then, it's been all over local news that Dominion, that company that we keep hearing about, electronic voting machine company, that people using...
[01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:45.720]  That machine, other machines as well, that kept flipping Republican votes to Democrat votes.
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:46.840]  People would check their ballot.
[01:42:47.039 --> 01:42:48.420]  They do the machine, get the copy.
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:49.119]  Well, this isn't right.
[01:42:49.939 --> 01:42:51.279]  Oh, machines are broken, come back later.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:54.779]  They totally attack MTG, me, threaten to sue us, all this.
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:56.539]  We were just reporting what her constituents were saying.
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:01.600]  They sued Giuliani, sued Fox, sued a bunch of groups.
[01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:05.699]  And they do it in key jurisdictions where it's all controlled, just like my fake trials.
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:08.439]  And say, oh, look, look, you know, it's all true.
[01:43:08.619 --> 01:43:09.520]  Dominion's totally perfect.
[01:43:11.439 --> 01:43:16.300]  The Secretary of State, Jocelyn Benson, is a Soros anti-Trump operative.
[01:43:17.539 --> 01:43:22.119]  She's allowed with the feds 500,000 phantom voters that aren't on the voter rolls to stay on in Michigan.
[01:43:23.279 --> 01:43:40.350]  And now, she just admitted that there are nationwide problems, that's an understatement, by Dominion Computers, voting machines, They first denied there were these 500,000 phantoms.
[01:43:40.689 --> 01:43:41.569]  Now they say it's no problem.
[01:43:41.710 --> 01:43:42.130]  Totally illegal.
[01:43:43.689 --> 01:43:44.170]  Now...
[01:43:44.170 --> 01:43:47.409]  I'll play the clip of her.
[01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:50.489]  She just hides it in plain view and says...
[01:43:50.489 --> 01:43:53.869]  Voters are just going to have to deal with this.
[01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:56.029]  Now, get ready for this.
[01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:58.890]  And they're admitting this.
[01:43:58.890 --> 01:43:59.810]  This is not debatable.
[01:44:03.529 --> 01:44:06.369]  There are hundreds of thousands of people voting...
[01:44:08.659 --> 01:44:09.779]  From different addresses.
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:14.500]  And many of them aren't even voters.
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:18.939]  And of course they're voting for Kamala.
[01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:26.600]  And they just say that's the way it is.
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:29.140]  Oh, wow.
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:31.079]  Just like, yeah, illegal aliens are voting.
[01:44:31.399 --> 01:44:32.159]  Big deal.
[01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:36.279]  Supreme Court says no to Virginia and the federal judge.
[01:44:36.810 --> 01:44:38.430]  But all those other states already said they could.
[01:44:38.630 --> 01:44:45.289]  And Nevada two days ago said, hey, we'll just take un-postmarked ballots for three days after so they can supply whatever they need.
[01:44:46.529 --> 01:44:51.609]  And the Democrats are suing with the feds to block any cameras at Dropboxes.
[01:44:52.789 --> 01:44:55.510]  Because they don't want Dinesh and Susie to get those tapes again.
[01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:57.529]  So let me read this to you.
[01:44:58.529 --> 01:45:00.250]  New, Nick Sordor's reporting.
[01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:01.510]  Post this on my ex.
[01:45:01.609 --> 01:45:03.770]  I do most of my posting, but just you guys, I don't...
[01:45:04.989 --> 01:45:05.930]  I've got my ex in there.
[01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:06.689]  Post this right now.
[01:45:06.810 --> 01:45:08.689]  Just say smoking gun and put it out.
[01:45:09.609 --> 01:45:11.689]  New Michigan Secretary of State.
[01:45:13.670 --> 01:45:14.670]  It's new that it's breaking.
[01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:15.270]  She's not new.
[01:45:15.630 --> 01:45:16.350]  New, breaking.
[01:45:16.609 --> 01:45:17.710]  Michigan Secretary of State.
[01:45:18.569 --> 01:45:27.989]  Jocelyn Benson says there is a nationwide, as a quote, issue with Dominion Voter Access Terminals preventing voters from making certain selections.
[01:45:28.489 --> 01:45:30.189]  Of course there is.
[01:45:30.569 --> 01:45:39.829]  According to her office, this, quote, programming issue cannot be fixed and voters are being forced to deal with it.
[01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:43.810]  Why was this issue not caught during the testing period?
[01:45:44.630 --> 01:45:48.470]  And why can't we just use paper ballots?
[01:45:49.229 --> 01:45:52.930]  He was on TV last week saying it's insane, Dominion's perfect, there's no problem.
[01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:55.369]  When people were already reporting this.
[01:45:55.590 --> 01:45:57.909]  Now let me read to you the numbers.
[01:45:58.590 --> 01:46:28.420]  At reviewing the qualified voter file, QVF, that's the databases of who's registered, We're good to go.
[01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:38.029]  This results in a 164,568 excess ballots as of 10-29-24.
[01:46:38.029 --> 01:46:39.369]  That's just yesterday.
[01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:51.149]  Below is the voter ID. That'll give you a headache.
[01:46:52.369 --> 01:46:53.850]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:47:05.680]  And they'll sue people that talk about it in key jurisdictions and take everything they got if you talk about it.
[01:47:12.479 --> 01:47:19.880]  The ADL said at their award ceremony three years ago where they named me Sasha Baron Cohen was the guy that said it.
[01:47:20.579 --> 01:47:27.380]  Anybody saying there's replacement migration, which is an official UN plan to bring in illegals to replace us, should be put in prison.
[01:47:28.619 --> 01:47:33.279]  And now they're talking about putting you in prison, they've indicted Trump for it in Georgia, if you question this crap.
[01:47:34.699 --> 01:47:35.399]  We're going to break.
[01:47:35.939 --> 01:47:40.659]  We'll air a special report for five minutes, and then Dale Comstock is going to be in studio with us to cover the waterfront.
[01:47:40.979 --> 01:47:41.979]  Very important guest.
[01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:43.140]  Came here from a long way.
[01:47:43.319 --> 01:47:44.420]  We appreciate him being here.
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:48.319]  He'll definitely want his perspective on the world and what's personally happened to him as a microcosm.
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:50.359]  Because they're not coming after him.
[01:47:50.479 --> 01:47:51.659]  They've got to get through him to get to you.
[01:47:51.739 --> 01:47:52.659]  It's the same story.
[01:47:55.779 --> 01:47:56.859]  We're the targets today.
[01:47:56.859 --> 01:47:57.840]  You're the targets tomorrow.
[01:47:58.939 --> 01:48:01.300]  Please remember, I can't fight the new world without your help.

[01:49:00.170 --> 01:49:00.989]  We're in this together.

[01:49:22.069 --> 01:49:22.789]  We're giving back to you.
[01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:24.510]  So many other great...
[01:49:24.510 --> 01:49:28.210]  We've got the new Energy and Sleep Gummies, $15 a package.
[01:49:29.369 --> 01:49:30.550]  Take action now.
[01:49:30.949 --> 01:49:32.090]  That's the essence of victory.
[01:49:32.630 --> 01:49:33.710]  TheAlexJoneStore.com.
[01:49:34.409 --> 01:49:37.569]  Wear a Trump t-shirt, put a sign on the lawn, wear a mega hat, you know?
[01:49:37.829 --> 01:49:40.109]  And then if people confront you, say, yeah, that's right.
[01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:42.590]  Elon Musk is absolutely right.
[01:49:43.029 --> 01:49:51.850]  We need to show our support for President Trump as a champion against the globalists, as the champion, by wearing his shirts out in public and not being ashamed.
[01:49:52.439 --> 01:49:56.779]  Because the majority of Americans, the number of shows, support Trump, but they're still scared to say it.
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:59.960]  You will meet so many like-minded people when you wear President Trump shirts.
[01:50:00.079 --> 01:50:01.899]  We've got some great ones at thealexjohnstore.com.
[01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:09.920]  But Infowars shirts are recognized by patriots and tyrants alike as the symbol of the resistance.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.880]  Old school, true rebels, true mavericks against tyranny.
[01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:19.920]  Now when you go to thealexjohnstore.com, there's amazing hoodies, ball caps, new designs getting added every few days, amazing t-shirts.
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:28.060]  But two of the shirts are marked up a little more than $25, $30 or so, so that you can really know you helped fundraise.
[01:50:28.199 --> 01:50:35.979]  And it's the classic InfoWars red on navy blue, and it is the Punisher shirt right here that everybody really loves.
[01:50:36.579 --> 01:50:37.279]  Because it's true.
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:41.619]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God, 1776.
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:43.859]  So both of these shirts are our best sellers.
[01:50:44.039 --> 01:50:50.899]  I want to thank those of you that are supported, and I want to encourage those of you that have been supported to get them both at thealexjonesstore.com right now at this critical time.
[01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:59.659]  InfoWars can be shut down in just 21 days as the time I'm taping this, but your support of our sponsor will keep me on the air one way or another.
[01:50:59.779 --> 01:51:02.819]  But it takes funds to get all that set up, and it's happening right now.
[01:51:03.069 --> 01:51:04.350]  So now is the time of action.
[01:51:04.630 --> 01:51:07.449]  Go to thealexjohnestore.com and get both these amazing shirts.
[01:51:07.829 --> 01:51:13.810]  Again, the Rebellion to Tyrants' Obedience to God's Shirt is one of the special fundraisers and so is this classic InfoWars.
[01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:16.890]  Notice this is at XXL. It's baggy now.
[01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:20.369]  In just the last few months, I've been taking the Ultimate CMOS and it's helped me lose all this weight.
[01:51:20.609 --> 01:51:24.430]  Find that as well and help keep us on there one way or another at thealexjohnestore.com.
[01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:25.250]  Thanks for your support.
[01:51:38.970 --> 01:51:41.770]  We're good to go.
[01:51:54.529 --> 01:52:02.170]  It is basically investing billions of dollars in trying to manipulate the guts of people with so-called mRNA vaccines.
[01:52:02.329 --> 01:52:02.970]  It's insane.
[01:52:03.170 --> 01:52:09.390]  But all the research is just overwhelming that happy gut means happy, healthy body.
[01:52:09.609 --> 01:52:20.170]  We now have the ultimate gut combo with the ultimate probiotic with 60 billion, super high quality, with this baby, ultimate gut cleanse.
[01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:23.489]  Now, These are both private labels, some of the top brands in the country.
[01:52:23.729 --> 01:52:26.369]  Our sponsors had to make it a little bit stronger, so it's proprietary.
[01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:30.590]  And the probiotics are very exciting and just a foundational thing that everybody should be doing.
[01:52:31.489 --> 01:52:32.569]  This is amazing.
[01:52:32.569 --> 01:52:33.949]  It's not just a gut cleanse.
[01:52:34.770 --> 01:52:41.489]  We may rename it down the road to gut cleanse, detox, anti-parasite.
[01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:54.100]  Pro-prostate, because it's concentrated, it's super strong, and it's got the gut cleanse, it's got the anti-parasite, it's got the sawpaw meadow.
[01:52:54.260 --> 01:52:59.880]  For not just your prostate, it's good for all your glands, but even the government's admitted for decades, sawpaw meadow is...
[01:52:59.949 --> 01:53:00.590]  Insane.
[01:53:00.670 --> 01:53:01.010]  Look it up.
[01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:03.510]  So, this is beyond a gut cleanse.
[01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:05.729]  It's got the trifecta going.
[01:53:05.989 --> 01:53:26.930]  I don't have time to read to you all of the amazing ingredients in this, but you can get Ultimate Gut Cleanse for 30 to 50% off, depending on how many bottles you get, and you can get Ultimate Probiotic for 30 to 50% off, depending on how many bottles you get, or you can get both together in the Ultimate Combo for 50% off as an introductory offer right now.
[01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:48.060]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:53:50.039 --> 01:53:53.500]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:58.309 --> 01:53:59.449]  We're good to go.
[01:54:03.449 --> 01:54:14.890]  Imagine a quiet night shattered by gunfire as unmarked cars slip through the shadows of the city of Aden, carrying American and French mercenaries on a mission from a foreign prince.
[01:54:15.130 --> 01:54:22.989]  On the night of December 29th, 2015, the operator's target is an office building where a suspected terrorist leader is meeting with his allies.
[01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:27.789]  What you're looking at here is the actual drone surveillance footage of the incident.
[01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:35.109]  At 9.57 p.m., the cars reach the address and the operators get out to plant a bomb on the office doors.
[01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:40.329]  But just then, shots ring out and a chaotic firefight erupts in the quiet neighborhood.
[01:54:40.609 --> 01:54:44.789]  The team has to improvise quickly before the whole city bears down on them.
[01:54:45.029 --> 01:54:51.149]  They just barely manage to secure the bomb onto the front door and they pile back into one of the vehicles.
[01:54:51.470 --> 01:54:55.050]  They leave one of the other cars parked behind, packed with explosives.
[01:54:55.710 --> 01:55:05.210]  As the team speeds off and they exfil, the two bombs explode one after the other, demolishing the building and spreading confusion throughout the city about what just happened.
[01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:14.350]  But the team members weren't operating under the French or American flag officially, even though some of them were still reservists in the Navy SEALs and the Maryland National Guard.
[01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:23.350]  They were working as contractors for a private security company called Spear Operations Group, and their employer was the United Arab Emirates.
[01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:39.020]  With orders coming from the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed himself, the mercenaries had gotten tangled up in a much larger geopolitical battle between the Houthis and Yemen's government, United States, and UAE competing for control of the valuable port city.
[01:55:39.229 --> 01:55:46.710]  This story takes us through the inner workings of how a team of mercenaries was assembled to execute a murky assassination mission.
[01:55:46.909 --> 01:55:50.050]  It legitimately sounds like something out of the movie The Expendables.
[01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:55.609]  When I first stumbled across this story, I thought it was absolutely wild and I knew I needed to share it with you guys.
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:56:04.039]  It opens up a whole can of worms about the legal status of mercenaries under the rules of warfare and their place within covert operations.
[01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:06.960]  This is a shadowy world that we're talking about here.
[01:56:07.119 --> 01:56:10.060]  They operate in a gray area of laws and ethics.
[01:56:10.319 --> 01:56:19.020]  Because what sets the Spear Operations Group apart and their mission in Yemen is that they weren't just hired as consultants or security specialists.
[01:56:19.279 --> 01:56:21.760]  Spear Group was simply handed a list.
[01:56:31.419 --> 01:56:38.060]  U.S. laws make it illegal to quote conspire to kill, kidnap, or maim someone in a foreign country.
[01:56:38.239 --> 01:56:43.899]  However, at the same time, the U.S. and many other nations don't outright ban mercenaries.
[01:56:44.239 --> 01:56:50.000]  In the United States, for example, their activities are indirectly regulated by the Arms Export Control Act.
[01:56:50.159 --> 01:56:58.880]  This means the State Department licenses these companies and monitors their implementation of their contracts in order to export their military services legally.
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:04.039]  So the State Department denied ever issuing a license to Spear Group for this mission.
[01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:14.479]  There's a case to be made that PMCs like Spear Group, willing to take on these kind of risky missions in legally grey areas, are what's needed to fight against this new breed of transnational terrorism.
[01:57:14.819 --> 01:57:20.319]  There's an argument to be made that when you're fighting a ruthless terror organization, you have to be willing to get your hands a little dirty.
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:25.840]  Private military companies may even be more useful in a fight against terrorism, precisely because...
[01:57:26.539 --> 01:57:29.779]  They don't have all the bureaucratic trappings of a state institution.
[01:57:30.340 --> 01:57:36.739]  PMCs offer this fluid, flexible response that's more agile than even what special forces can provide.
[01:57:37.119 --> 01:57:40.699]  In fact, the United States is one of the top employers of PMCs in conflict zones.
[01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:45.119]  They employed over 100,000 different PMC contractors over the course of the Iraq war.
[01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:52.119]  Both the U.S. and U.K. declined to ratify new international treaties that strengthen laws against mercenaries.
[01:57:52.279 --> 01:57:57.699]  If PMCs are so bad, why would countries with powerful militaries of their own continue to use them?
[01:57:57.899 --> 01:58:07.760]  That's the belief of Spear Group founder Abraham Golan, who modeled the company's operations after the Israelis' own targeted elimination programs that have seen a lot of success recently.
[01:58:07.939 --> 01:58:10.279]  Quote from Golan, Maybe I'm a monster.
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:12.079]  Maybe I should be in jail.
[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:13.539]  Maybe I'm a bad guy.
[01:58:14.279 --> 01:58:15.000]  But I'm right.
[01:58:15.239 --> 01:58:15.939]  End quote.
[01:58:16.659 --> 01:58:19.520]  Our guest who's in that piece, Dale Comstock, straight ahead.
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:24.939]  We're doing the deep dive on the deep state from how it affects all of us down to his life, straight ahead.
[01:58:25.079 --> 01:58:27.859]  You want to stay with us and share those live links, my Paul Revere's.
[01:58:28.399 --> 01:58:33.819]  All right, joining us for the next hour and a half is Dale Comstock, and we're going to get him on Owen's show as well.
[01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:35.140]  He's been gracious enough to stay with us.
[01:58:35.239 --> 01:58:36.539]  He's come a long way to be here with us.
[01:58:37.819 --> 01:58:38.699]  DaleComstock.com.
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:42.590]  He's got the best-selling book, American Badass, and This guy's great.
[01:58:42.729 --> 01:58:47.869]  I know a lot of great patriots that know him, not just his public history, but the great things he's done for this country.
[01:58:48.090 --> 01:59:01.369]  And boy, he's given me some previously unknown documents from the FBI and things like that we're going to be going over here today because his story is a microcosm for us to understand what's happening in a bigger picture, like looking through a keyhole.
[01:59:01.569 --> 01:59:05.609]  We'll talk about a lot of things he's been through, what's been happening with the corruption in the U.S. government.
[01:59:06.579 --> 01:59:10.399]  That really shows us how this head is rotting from the carcass from the head down.
[01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:19.039]  And we're going to talk about the election, you know, all the claims about the CIA and FBI that the Trump supporters are going to launch terror attacks during the election with no evidence.
[01:59:19.399 --> 01:59:24.199]  Clearly, I think they're preparing to provoke a tour of something like the fake Whitmer kidnapping or January 6th again.
[01:59:24.699 --> 01:59:27.060]  Just all of this news and more.
[01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:29.640]  And Dr.
[01:59:29.819 --> 01:59:49.100]  Dale Comstock served 10 years We're good to go.
[01:59:50.350 --> 02:00:05.069]  We're good to go.
[02:00:16.199 --> 02:00:18.319]  If big breaking news happens, I've got to bring it up.
[02:00:18.399 --> 02:00:24.300]  And that's like Trump getting shot at or, you know, Ukraine surrendering or something.
[02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:26.239]  We would jump in here.
[02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:30.539]  But just up front, we're going to hit this election news in a moment and get your take on it.
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:40.560]  But just first off, for the listeners, tell folks about yourself, why you're here, and then just a 35,000-foot view with your, you know, very interesting experience, your perspective on where we are.
[02:00:41.079 --> 02:00:42.399]  Yeah, thanks for having me on the show.
[02:00:43.479 --> 02:00:52.819]  So my background, as you stated, I spent 20 years in the US Army, attended as a stealth force operator, as a Green Beret, light heavy weapons expert, infantry.
[02:00:54.539 --> 02:01:00.539]  Post 9-11, I ended up working for the government for about another 10 years, doing paramilitary type work.
[02:01:00.819 --> 02:01:03.060]  And then I went on to start my own security companies.
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:14.760]  And then started working, I use the word mercenary, but basically went out and provided my skills to friendly foreign countries that needed the types of services I could provide.
[02:01:16.319 --> 02:01:21.159]  So, big view, my big picture of the country, I don't even recognize it.
[02:01:21.239 --> 02:01:29.390]  I told my friend of mine earlier today that my dad could If my dad knew what was going on today, he'd roll over in his grave because he's a patriot like me.
[02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:34.890]  He's also a Vietnam veteran, 20 years, passed away from complications from Agent Orange.
[02:01:35.670 --> 02:01:36.829]  My son's a Green Beret.
[02:01:37.050 --> 02:01:40.069]  My entire family has a military culture behind it.
[02:01:40.170 --> 02:01:41.789]  And we're all patriots, we're all Americans.
[02:01:42.189 --> 02:01:48.350]  And as I watch what's going on, I realize that this is no longer the America that I grew up in.
[02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:51.289]  In fact, I don't even, I live here, but I also live in two other countries.
[02:01:51.369 --> 02:01:53.649]  I won't name those countries just for my own security.
[02:01:54.250 --> 02:01:59.649]  And the reason I wanted to come on the show today, Alex, was to highlight or illuminate what's actually going on.
[02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:06.170]  The question was posed to me, do you think that the US government is intentionally targeting you because of things that happened to me?
[02:02:06.409 --> 02:02:11.829]  And after some careful consideration, I realized that, yeah, it's very possible.
[02:02:11.829 --> 02:02:16.090]  And here's essentially what happened, and I'll just stick to the general topics here.
[02:02:16.369 --> 02:02:17.569]  My wife is Indonesian.
[02:02:19.010 --> 02:02:20.670]  She and I were married in the United States.
[02:02:22.260 --> 02:02:23.460]  We're back and forth constantly.
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:27.619]  And then she got, in fact, she got a DOD dependent ID card.
[02:02:27.779 --> 02:02:29.960]  So I should tell you a little bit about who my wife is.
[02:02:30.060 --> 02:02:32.260]  She's not like some foreigner, just came across the border.
[02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:38.039]  Several years ago, two years ago, in fact, she was hit by a police car at 90 miles an hour one night in a high-speed pursuit.
[02:02:38.199 --> 02:02:40.699]  She was a passenger to another car just parking to make a turn.
[02:02:41.319 --> 02:02:46.720]  Took her out, hospitalized her, and then during her therapy, It was determined that she had cancer.
[02:02:46.939 --> 02:02:49.420]  She ended up going to cancer treatment.
[02:02:50.079 --> 02:02:54.159]  And then COVID restrictions kicked in and we couldn't get back to our home in Indonesia.
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.279]  Essentially, we overstayed her visa.
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:02:57.539]  We didn't know that.
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:01.760]  So we did go back home, came back six weeks later for following doctor's appointments.
[02:03:02.239 --> 02:03:06.840]  And we were both pulled a secondary at LAX by CBP. We were separated.
[02:03:07.579 --> 02:03:10.680]  They told me to wait downstairs for a couple hours while they interviewed her.
[02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:17.609]  We're good to go.
[02:03:35.050 --> 02:03:38.289]  I was notified six months ago that I have an active threat against me.
[02:03:39.090 --> 02:03:45.810]  I don't know if I wanna give credit to the organization that's actively looking for me, particularly here in Florida, but they've come across the borders.
[02:03:46.270 --> 02:03:48.829]  And basically, I am a priority target for them.
[02:03:49.789 --> 02:03:59.909]  I was warned by DOJ. They gave me what's called a duty to warn and told me to take care of my family, get off the X. As I tried to do that, I was basically, it's been six months now.
[02:04:00.010 --> 02:04:01.229]  I'm still stuck in another country.
[02:04:01.409 --> 02:04:05.279]  My family is literally Living under a threat.
[02:04:05.859 --> 02:04:11.199]  And so this country, this government, this particular administration has done nothing to help me.
[02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:16.060]  And I'll use the words that they used when I approached them about it.
[02:04:16.159 --> 02:04:20.140]  They said, basically, sometimes we have to take responsibility for the choices we make in life.
[02:04:20.279 --> 02:04:21.100]  And I thought, wow.
[02:04:21.630 --> 02:04:25.430]  Here's the guy that stood between terrorists and your family, your American family.
[02:04:25.550 --> 02:04:31.529]  Now you're telling me I'm on my own and I have to sacrifice my family because it's a choice that I made in my lifetime.
[02:04:31.890 --> 02:04:36.729]  And so I'm here to talk not only about my situation, but also about the veteran situation.
[02:04:37.369 --> 02:04:39.010]  I'm 100% disabled veteran.
[02:04:40.810 --> 02:04:49.189]  And I really wanna call I wanna say, let's say, call to attention, veterans out there.
[02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:50.970]  You need to be paying attention to what's going on.
[02:04:51.609 --> 02:04:53.989]  We've been trampled on, we've been trifled with.
[02:04:54.850 --> 02:05:05.449]  We haven't been given the due respect that we have earned, other than we've been put on the top of the FBI's list as probably the most dangerous people in America, and probably rightfully so, because we are a dangerous force.
[02:05:05.449 --> 02:05:12.760]  When you think about the millions of veterans that are out there, What we're capable of, if we're pushed to that level, could be daunting.
[02:05:13.439 --> 02:05:26.579]  And so, again, I wanna say, we live in a time that I'm embarrassed as I've lived in these foreign countries when I have foreigners walking up to me and go, what happened to your country?
[02:05:26.779 --> 02:05:28.399]  What are you guys doing to your children?
[02:05:30.369 --> 02:05:31.270]  How do you answer that?
[02:05:31.829 --> 02:05:35.850]  In fact, I don't even like to tell people I'm an American anymore just because it's so embarrassing.
[02:05:36.210 --> 02:05:41.970]  And if you think the rest of the world looks up to America, no, that's not the case anymore.
[02:05:42.090 --> 02:05:45.050]  They used to, but now we're laughing stock of the world, literally.
[02:05:47.949 --> 02:05:55.909]  And again, the reason this is important, and you've sent me some of these documents they don't want out, is they've allowed all these foreign forces into the United States.
[02:05:56.880 --> 02:06:00.380]  And they tell us that there's all these giant groups of military-age men, and we know they're there.
[02:06:00.460 --> 02:06:05.239]  And we see them coming across with the same boots, the same backpacks, Chinese, Arab, African, Latin American.
[02:06:05.619 --> 02:06:06.960]  And they say a lot of them, yeah.
[02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:07.840]  And they check them.
[02:06:07.899 --> 02:06:09.079]  They're actually Hezbollah leaders.
[02:06:09.079 --> 02:06:10.100]  We're coming to get you.
[02:06:10.779 --> 02:06:14.899]  And then they start going around harassing and targeting and encasing places.
[02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:17.180]  And then they're getting ready to hit Iran.
[02:06:17.619 --> 02:06:24.880]  It looks to me like the deep state's planning to allow these people to operate, to use that as a crisis to bring in tyranny against the people.
[02:06:26.020 --> 02:06:36.119]  In response to the threat that they've allowed to metastasize, and we know in any tyranny, once they take over, they try to go after the soldiers and leaders that they think during a takeover would resist.
[02:06:36.119 --> 02:06:45.079]  So just like after a war, they spike a cannon there with the purge of the military, with the poison shots, with the critical race theory, with the transgenderism.
[02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:49.560]  They admit that's been a plan to try to kick the good folks out and then target them after.
[02:06:49.619 --> 02:06:53.579]  We know in all the homeland security training going on for decades that a lot of it's secret, but a lot of it's leaked.
[02:06:54.119 --> 02:07:04.939]  They talk about veterans being the main threat and constitutional terrorists, and now we see Homeland Security saying the main threat are Trump supporters and veterans, and they think we're going to launch terror attacks.
[02:07:05.260 --> 02:07:09.079]  Looks like a setup to me that they're planning to commit crimes in your name.
[02:07:09.159 --> 02:07:11.899]  I'm not saying your name specifically, but that's the last piece of the puzzle.
[02:07:12.119 --> 02:07:13.420]  No, I agree with you 100%.
[02:07:13.420 --> 02:07:18.399]  You know, I always thought it was just a conspiracy, blah, blah, blah, but now I'm actually living it.
[02:07:19.420 --> 02:07:29.239]  And so when my government, the country that I fought for, My father has fought for, my son has fought for, my sister has fought for, my entire family has fought for.
[02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:36.619]  When they have abandoned me and cast me to the wolves and told me, well, you made a choice in life and you have to live with it.
[02:07:37.659 --> 02:07:39.020]  That's pretty damn disrespectful.
[02:07:39.930 --> 02:07:42.010]  And I think every veteran should take note of that.
[02:07:42.189 --> 02:07:45.090]  This is what this administration will do to you.
[02:07:45.170 --> 02:07:46.369]  You think they care about you?
[02:07:46.829 --> 02:07:55.390]  Ask everybody that's on this VA program trying to get your disability, how long it takes to look after and get the compensation that you deserve.
[02:07:56.619 --> 02:08:11.659]  We're treated like we're, on one hand, I heard, I think it was last night, Kamala Harris talking about veterans and how we love veterans and respect, and Trump disrespected veterans by saying we're suckers and those types of things,
[02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:12.420]  which is all lies.
[02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:18.359]  But more importantly, we're basically used as pawns, political pawns for these people.
[02:08:18.659 --> 02:08:20.539]  Now, does Trump care for veterans?
[02:08:20.659 --> 02:08:21.600]  I believe he does.
[02:08:21.899 --> 02:08:25.239]  Does Kamala Harris and the sitting president care for us?
[02:08:25.260 --> 02:08:25.960]  I believe not.
[02:08:26.460 --> 02:08:33.840]  And the fact that they were willing to leave me hanging and leave my family exposed to a threat abroad, which I know they're looking for me.
[02:08:34.500 --> 02:08:35.859]  I've got surveillance on me.
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:36.539]  I know that.
[02:08:36.659 --> 02:08:40.119]  It's a matter of time before we have a head-on collision.
[02:08:40.539 --> 02:08:42.239]  And I don't know what the outcome's gonna be.
[02:08:42.319 --> 02:08:43.899]  And God forbid something happens to my family.
[02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:45.319]  Me, I can handle it.
[02:08:45.380 --> 02:08:46.979]  But my family, that's gonna be a different story.
[02:08:47.159 --> 02:08:48.859]  There's gonna be hell to pay for that.
[02:08:50.300 --> 02:08:54.100]  But they're willing to throw me out there, leave me hanging out there after everything I've done.
[02:08:54.180 --> 02:08:55.840]  And I don't want nothing, by the way, Alex.
[02:08:55.920 --> 02:08:58.539]  I don't want nothing from the government other than passage from my family.
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:08:59.279]  I don't want money.
[02:08:59.399 --> 02:09:00.119]  I don't want security.
[02:09:00.359 --> 02:09:03.439]  Just let me protect my own family, but let me get them home.
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:13.619]  And let's talk about these documents where they admit you're a target, they admit these groups are after you, and then what do they do?
[02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:16.359]  The FBI asked in this document, don't show anybody this.
[02:09:16.420 --> 02:09:17.539]  What is the document we're looking at?
[02:09:18.359 --> 02:09:20.939]  Yeah, so this is actually the duty to warn.
[02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:32.079]  So they're telling me not to, they said you can tell people that need to know, which I wanna know who that is, because everybody I told that needed to know have basically dismissed it.
[02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:36.520]  It doesn't take Six months, and in fact, nothing's happened.
[02:09:36.659 --> 02:09:39.300]  I applied for my wife's green card three years ago, okay?
[02:09:39.439 --> 02:09:43.039]  It's supposed to take four to seven months when I applied, and it's three years.
[02:09:43.140 --> 02:09:52.500]  And I've asked some of my friends that are actually some of my clients that work for DHS, and they told me the reason it's taking so long is because she got pushed to the back of the line, even though we have paid.
[02:09:52.859 --> 02:09:54.439]  She's married to a veteran, to a citizen.
[02:09:54.779 --> 02:09:56.979]  She got pushed to the back of the line, okay?
[02:09:57.100 --> 02:09:58.539]  And they moved everybody else.
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:09:59.779]  I'm gonna call them what they are.
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:00.260]  They're criminals.
[02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:01.239]  They cross the border illegally.
[02:10:01.380 --> 02:10:07.949]  If you're gonna classify my wife As an awful overstay as a criminal, then everybody else gets the same, you know, they're going to get the same respect.
[02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:13.350]  I'm going to show you some footage, I don't know if you've seen this, of what clearly is illegals being brought to the head of the line in Pennsylvania.
[02:10:13.970 --> 02:10:17.970]  And then the police all over the state are saying they're closing like at 1 p.m.
[02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:20.930]  And when people stay, more illegals are coming in to vote.
[02:10:21.050 --> 02:10:24.609]  So they're shutting it down for the voters and then bringing in these buses of illegals.
[02:10:24.770 --> 02:10:26.250]  I mean, this is so naked.
[02:10:26.470 --> 02:10:26.829]  Yes.
[02:10:27.370 --> 02:10:27.770]  Absolutely.
[02:10:27.970 --> 02:10:29.270]  And I'm living that myself.
[02:10:29.609 --> 02:10:33.189]  Three years, I'm waiting for a green card to bring my family home and I can't do it.
[02:10:33.689 --> 02:10:34.789]  She gets deported.
[02:10:35.289 --> 02:10:38.090]  Now they're telling me because she's been deported, she's got a three-year ban.
[02:10:38.350 --> 02:10:43.729]  And I'm like, how's that happened when I couldn't travel back anyways because of the COVID restrictions, the cancers?
[02:10:44.550 --> 02:10:46.170]  And it's one excuse after another.
[02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:55.050]  And every time I go to the embassy to pay money for the visas, etc., etc., they make me pay first, and then they turn around and tell me no.
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:10:57.739]  And I've been in and out of the embassy.
[02:10:58.140 --> 02:10:58.779]  Well, it's clear.
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:10:59.739]  It's a social credit score.
[02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:00.340]  It's already here.
[02:11:01.060 --> 02:11:01.939]  Patriots get sued.
[02:11:02.079 --> 02:11:02.760]  They get debanked.
[02:11:02.779 --> 02:11:03.279]  They get blocked.
[02:11:03.380 --> 02:11:04.420]  They don't get essential services.
[02:11:05.619 --> 02:11:08.479]  I mean, it's like in Springfield, Ohio.
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:12.960]  They had articles about a disabled veteran gets $700 a month from the state.
[02:11:13.789 --> 02:11:16.109]  But the state there is giving the illegals $2,000.
[02:11:16.369 --> 02:11:17.609]  The feds are giving them $3,000.
[02:11:17.989 --> 02:11:19.270]  That's $5,000 a month.
[02:11:19.409 --> 02:11:21.789]  They're literally incentivizing them if you come across illegally.
[02:11:22.149 --> 02:11:22.670]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:11:23.590 --> 02:11:26.170]  I've actually considered coming across the border with my family.
[02:11:27.130 --> 02:11:28.050]  Actually, I've done it.
[02:11:28.149 --> 02:11:31.989]  And the only reason I won't do it is because I don't want to have my family trapped here.
[02:11:32.090 --> 02:11:37.569]  I want to have the ability to take them back home when the posse rides through Dodge City, so to speak.
[02:11:38.170 --> 02:11:40.449]  And like I said, we're not looking for permanence.
[02:11:40.770 --> 02:11:41.350]  We could.
[02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:42.710]  I mean, I own a business that's abroad.
[02:11:42.810 --> 02:11:44.369]  My wife owns companies abroad.
[02:11:44.770 --> 02:11:48.729]  It's not that we want to come here because she needs a job, which she's been accused of, by the way.
[02:11:49.109 --> 02:11:50.890]  Well, it's like the memos came out three years ago.
[02:11:50.970 --> 02:11:54.829]  They won't let conservative Cubans into the country because they know they vote conservative.
[02:11:55.010 --> 02:11:55.869]  They won't let Cubans in.
[02:11:55.989 --> 02:11:56.890]  It's not about the color.
[02:11:57.050 --> 02:11:58.750]  It's that if you're a communist country, they let you in.
[02:11:58.829 --> 02:11:59.609]  Venezuela, look, come on.
[02:11:59.869 --> 02:12:00.909]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:12:01.289 --> 02:12:05.909]  And so there's a lot of inequities there, obviously.
[02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:07.470]  And I've even brought this up.
[02:12:07.590 --> 02:12:10.930]  It's like, how does the US government arbitrarily apply the law?
[02:12:11.149 --> 02:12:16.729]  How do you say, come across the border illegally, here's money, here's transportation, go for it.
[02:12:16.869 --> 02:12:28.350]  And then when a guy like me, a veteran has earned the right to bring his wife home, who's been here, by the way, like I said, she's got a DOD dependent ID card, is basically deported for an overstay that was outside of our control.
[02:12:28.979 --> 02:12:32.439]  And it makes me believe it's not about her, it's about me.
[02:12:33.079 --> 02:12:40.680]  And like I said a minute ago, I used to believe that America was the greatest country in the world.
[02:12:40.699 --> 02:12:43.439]  I believed that this government actually cared about its people.
[02:12:43.619 --> 02:12:46.479]  Now I realize that's not so at all.
[02:12:47.630 --> 02:12:54.890]  The fact they're willing, like I said earlier, to cast me and my family to the wolves and leave us out there on our own is just unbelievable.
[02:12:55.050 --> 02:12:55.510]  It's egregious.
[02:12:56.409 --> 02:12:57.850]  So what's the answer?
[02:12:58.050 --> 02:13:00.569]  Well, we'll find out next week if Trump gets elected or not.
[02:13:00.909 --> 02:13:04.189]  But again, my appeal is to the veterans out there.
[02:13:04.470 --> 02:13:06.069]  We have a voice.
[02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:07.189]  We need to exercise it.
[02:13:07.289 --> 02:13:08.170]  We need to be heard.
[02:13:08.329 --> 02:13:11.609]  We need to be seen until that time comes when we need to go dark.
[02:13:11.789 --> 02:13:15.810]  And that's not a call for action, a call to arms.
[02:13:15.970 --> 02:13:18.710]  I'm just saying, We gotta stop getting used.
[02:13:19.029 --> 02:13:21.270]  You know, they talk about everybody else getting used.
[02:13:21.409 --> 02:13:26.510]  You know, the minorities are getting used by Kamala Harris, and she's using us no different than anybody else.
[02:13:27.289 --> 02:13:29.390]  You know, the left essentially hates us.
[02:13:30.170 --> 02:13:31.529]  They just called us garbage.
[02:13:31.829 --> 02:13:32.569]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:33.029 --> 02:13:36.270]  You know, they called me garbage, they called my wife garbage, they called you garbage.
[02:13:36.510 --> 02:13:37.750]  We're all garbage, according to them.
[02:13:39.060 --> 02:13:54.880]  Now, let's talk about your expertise in clandestine operations everywhere and working for other major governments, other allies of the U.S., and your particular gravitas on that subject, looking at the country, looking at what's done,
[02:13:55.479 --> 02:14:01.880]  looking at how the feds were involved in J6, confirmed now, looking at how they tried to do the fake kidnapping of Whitmer to demonize American people.
[02:14:02.039 --> 02:14:20.430]  Now, Homeland Security is We're good to go.
[02:14:26.350 --> 02:14:28.069]  Trump is coming to kill the black people.
[02:14:28.289 --> 02:14:31.850]  We must have an armed uprising against him.
[02:14:31.909 --> 02:14:33.210]  We will not certify his win.
[02:14:33.470 --> 02:14:34.810]  We're going to have civil war conditions.
[02:14:34.989 --> 02:14:35.529]  These are all quotes.
[02:14:35.630 --> 02:14:36.130]  I can play the clips.
[02:14:36.229 --> 02:14:36.869]  I've played them so much.
[02:14:36.989 --> 02:14:39.050]  The audience is like, we've already heard them 18 times apiece.
[02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.489]  Don't do it.
[02:14:39.729 --> 02:14:41.130]  But usually I play something if I say it.
[02:14:41.189 --> 02:14:42.369]  But this is on record last month.
[02:14:42.430 --> 02:14:43.689]  Just constantly, every day, playing it.
[02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:47.390]  And then they've signed these executive orders.
[02:14:47.390 --> 02:14:49.930]  And I know they've had covert stuff for collapse or nuclear war.
[02:14:49.989 --> 02:14:50.970]  The military can operate domestically.
[02:14:51.170 --> 02:14:52.489]  This is for civil unrest.
[02:14:54.010 --> 02:14:57.890]  And for the first time, they're putting it out publicly that they're getting ready to, quote, shoot Americans.
[02:14:58.130 --> 02:15:04.430]  So they're blaming Trump for what they themselves are publicly preparing and trying to get the military trained to do.
[02:15:04.590 --> 02:15:15.149]  They wouldn't be saying if they weren't getting ready to go operational for the first time ever bringing out the documents and greenlighting it in a Pentagon manual that came out last month.
[02:15:16.279 --> 02:15:18.500]  And so I look at that, and it's like a jigsaw puzzle.
[02:15:18.659 --> 02:15:19.699]  It's got 100 pieces.
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:20.819]  There's only one piece left.
[02:15:21.159 --> 02:15:29.720]  That staged something to blame us or wind up some lunatic to do that, like this mercenary American that went over with Ukraine and sent back, tried to kill Trump.
[02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:36.439]  We predicted they would use those cutouts with my sources, and that's exactly what happened because we weren't just imagining that.
[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:38.239]  We had the intel on it from good guys inside.
[02:15:38.340 --> 02:15:45.260]  So there are a lot of good people in the system, and there's really an awakening in the corporations, the government, everywhere, that, wow, really bad people are at the top.
[02:15:45.850 --> 02:15:47.050]  So there's that loss of trust.
[02:15:47.210 --> 02:15:48.869]  And it's not a loss of trust with America itself.
[02:15:48.890 --> 02:15:49.489]  I want to be clear.
[02:15:49.609 --> 02:15:50.630]  It's that we're hijacked.
[02:15:50.750 --> 02:15:51.829]  We've been held hostage.
[02:15:52.390 --> 02:15:53.649]  And there's that realization.
[02:15:53.649 --> 02:16:03.170]  So knowing what you know about the world, very accomplished, a lot of operations, you've definitely burned a lot of tire tread there.
[02:16:04.489 --> 02:16:10.729]  Just as a veteran, as a citizen, looking at this and into the mind of the bad guys, what do you think they're planning?
[02:16:10.850 --> 02:16:17.789]  Because it makes no sense to say Trump's going to kill everybody, his supporters are going to murder all the brown people, and he's Hitler, and they're going to stage terror attacks.
[02:16:17.989 --> 02:16:24.789]  I don't see that much chatter and memos and emergency alerts without the bad guys planning to stage a false flag.
[02:16:25.250 --> 02:16:26.789]  Yeah, so I'm glad you asked that question.
[02:16:27.029 --> 02:16:29.970]  So I make a living as a security consultant advisor.
[02:16:30.210 --> 02:16:32.069]  I travel the world fixing problems for people.
[02:16:32.270 --> 02:16:34.350]  I either bring people home or send people home.
[02:16:34.649 --> 02:16:36.790]  And I had this conversation recently.
[02:16:37.030 --> 02:16:40.229]  I predicted over a year ago they would attempt to kill Trump.
[02:16:40.409 --> 02:16:44.590]  And then when that happened, actually the night before it happened, I was on a podcast, I said it again.
[02:16:44.670 --> 02:16:46.450]  The next morning on another podcast, I said it again.
[02:16:46.510 --> 02:16:47.370]  That afternoon it happened.
[02:16:48.229 --> 02:16:51.329]  And I said it's gonna happen again, and it did, twice.
[02:16:52.290 --> 02:16:53.129]  That we know of.
[02:16:53.250 --> 02:17:04.170]  Yeah, and I believe it's going to happen again, but here's what I actually, and this is very dark, but I've got to be honest, and I'm sure they're thinking about it, I hope they're thinking about it, but I don't think Trump's going to be the target next time.
[02:17:04.729 --> 02:17:13.309]  If I was thinking like a bad guy, because I know how bad guys think, that's how I make my living, I think the next target's going to be either his son or his wife or both of them.
[02:17:13.670 --> 02:17:16.290]  And I hope to hell they've got some good security on those.
[02:17:16.430 --> 02:17:17.329]  I mean, what a target.
[02:17:17.659 --> 02:17:20.159]  You take out one of those two, you're going to get in that man's head.
[02:17:20.379 --> 02:17:22.879]  And then if you do that, you go, oh, guess what?
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:23.319]  You know what?
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:24.180]  We can't have an election.
[02:17:24.340 --> 02:17:24.940]  We can't do anything.
[02:17:25.059 --> 02:17:31.420]  We're going to have to hold, you know, Kamala's going to have to hold the Ford down until we get civil, you know, everything under control again.
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:33.219]  Who knows how long that will take?
[02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:34.340]  I think that will be the play.
[02:17:34.739 --> 02:17:37.600]  And, you know, that's my professional opinion.
[02:17:37.899 --> 02:17:38.479]  Flesh it out.
[02:17:38.639 --> 02:17:39.399]  You have a lot of time here.
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:40.139]  Please, continue.
[02:17:40.459 --> 02:17:45.940]  So, I mean, and I've been right on a lot of my predictions in the past, you know, and another one, and I'll give you an example.
[02:17:45.940 --> 02:17:52.280]  I was on your show a couple years ago about the Chinese balloons, and we're talking about various methodologies that the bad guys might employ.
[02:17:52.379 --> 02:18:01.639]  And actually, years ago, I mentioned, I'm surprised, well, I wasn't surprised, that the next attack will be, you know, that in that era would be using trains, right?
[02:18:01.799 --> 02:18:03.020]  So, you derail, how easy is it?
[02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:04.790]  Is it to derail a train?
[02:18:04.909 --> 02:18:05.670]  It's very simple, right?
[02:18:05.809 --> 02:18:13.090]  Quarter block of C4, explosives, hell, you go out with a cutting torch, you cut a piece of the track off, you derail a train, it's moving 80 miles an hour, chemicals through it.
[02:18:13.110 --> 02:18:14.110]  It's a very soft target.
[02:18:14.530 --> 02:18:15.129]  Easy, right?
[02:18:15.309 --> 02:18:17.930]  And so, but you know how many train developments we have every year?
[02:18:17.950 --> 02:18:18.629]  You don't hear about this.
[02:18:18.850 --> 02:18:21.190]  Over 1,000 trading derailments every year, okay?
[02:18:21.409 --> 02:18:26.309]  And so the one we had not too long ago where, you know, got derailed up in the north, all right?
[02:18:26.309 --> 02:18:27.590]  You think that was just an accident?
[02:18:27.750 --> 02:18:28.309]  I don't.
[02:18:28.389 --> 02:18:30.190]  I think that was deliberate.
[02:18:30.370 --> 02:18:34.329]  And we know the FBI's been covering it up because they've caught a lot of Antifa and communists doing it.
[02:18:34.450 --> 02:18:38.049]  Yeah, and so there's, you know, they're not stupid, okay?
[02:18:38.049 --> 02:18:40.110]  And we have to stop underestimating their capability.
[02:18:40.250 --> 02:18:40.489]  I mean...
[02:18:41.649 --> 02:18:45.409]  Jesus Christ, they flew two aircraft into the Twin Towers.
[02:18:45.670 --> 02:18:48.870]  And which, by the way, everybody goes, that's a conspiracy theory, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:18:49.030 --> 02:18:49.809]  That was an inside job.
[02:18:49.989 --> 02:18:51.770]  Well, I would argue not necessary.
[02:18:53.290 --> 02:18:54.209]  There's no way.
[02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:58.399]  Anybody could have actually blown those buildings up from the inside.
[02:18:58.620 --> 02:18:58.940]  No way.
[02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:02.120]  I have personal knowledge about that because of my background.
[02:19:02.340 --> 02:19:06.459]  But I do believe that there might have been some other underhandedness involved in that.
[02:19:06.940 --> 02:19:13.659]  But speaking fast forward today, my point was, thinking as a bad guy, what would I do?
[02:19:14.319 --> 02:19:15.639]  Because that's how I make my living.
[02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:19.180]  That's how I help people protect their properties, their lives, and things like that.
[02:19:19.500 --> 02:19:23.020]  That would be my attack methodology, is you know what?
[02:19:23.059 --> 02:19:23.840]  I couldn't get this man.
[02:19:23.899 --> 02:19:24.659]  He's too well guarded.
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:27.860]  What's the best way to take him out and get into his head?
[02:19:27.860 --> 02:19:28.920]  By taking out his family.
[02:19:30.299 --> 02:19:40.200]  And I think Trump is strong, but look, I don't care how strong you are, even how I'm pretty strong, that would have a serious impact on my morale and my leadership and my ability to function.
[02:19:42.549 --> 02:19:45.969]  Again, I think that's probably going to be the next course of action.
[02:19:45.989 --> 02:19:46.950]  What about serviced air missile?
[02:19:47.889 --> 02:19:48.549]  Very possible.
[02:19:48.889 --> 02:19:53.670]  So I'm not gonna name the oil company I worked for as a consultant many years ago.
[02:19:53.690 --> 02:19:55.229]  Well, there's a report seven got smuggled in.
[02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:55.750]  Yeah.
[02:19:56.190 --> 02:20:03.930]  Well, about 15 years ago, 12 years ago, I was doing some security surveys down on the border in Texas, in fact, for some oil companies.
[02:20:04.229 --> 02:20:14.229]  And their intel sources had told me they had recovered caches with AK-47s, prayer rugs, quite a bit of weaponry cached along the border there.
[02:20:14.350 --> 02:20:15.469]  I remember seeing photos of that.
[02:20:15.649 --> 02:20:15.770]  Yeah.
[02:20:16.229 --> 02:20:18.870]  And this information I got had never been actually published.
[02:20:19.049 --> 02:20:20.409]  It was even more than what we knew about.
[02:20:20.549 --> 02:20:22.389]  Yeah, and so now we're talking about missiles.
[02:20:22.629 --> 02:20:24.069]  Yeah, that's easy.
[02:20:24.350 --> 02:20:25.409]  That's not hard to do at all.
[02:20:25.469 --> 02:20:26.870]  And yeah, I believe that's a real threat.
[02:20:27.090 --> 02:20:33.370]  I mean, you bring in one surface air missile, shoulder fire system, and it doesn't have to be a long shot either.
[02:20:33.770 --> 02:20:34.809]  Wait until it comes into land.
[02:20:35.010 --> 02:20:35.950]  Yeah, or take off.
[02:20:36.049 --> 02:20:36.969]  Shoot them in the ass, coming out.
[02:20:37.229 --> 02:20:38.750]  So, yeah, I think it's very possible.
[02:20:38.850 --> 02:20:39.709]  There's so many ways to...
[02:20:41.259 --> 02:20:44.500]  To sabotage this election using, like you said, Confederates on the inside.
[02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:46.420]  They've already ushered them all in.
[02:20:46.540 --> 02:20:46.979]  They're already here.
[02:20:47.059 --> 02:20:47.659]  You know how I know that?
[02:20:47.659 --> 02:20:49.239]  Because they're looking for me in our own country.
[02:20:50.700 --> 02:20:53.340]  So what if the US government said, hey, you know what?
[02:20:53.420 --> 02:20:54.360]  We're gonna recruit you guys.
[02:20:54.399 --> 02:20:55.360]  This is your job.
[02:20:55.459 --> 02:20:56.079]  We're gonna pay you money.
[02:20:56.219 --> 02:20:57.100]  We're gonna give you free passage.
[02:20:57.219 --> 02:20:57.760]  They'll stay there.
[02:20:58.389 --> 02:21:09.510]  As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm dark MAGA. A few weeks ago, when I saw Elon Musk in Pennsylvania with Trump at Butler, and he had that dark MAGA hat on, I said, we've got to have our own.
[02:21:09.770 --> 02:21:10.989]  And we've come out with it.
[02:21:11.430 --> 02:21:16.309]  Yeah, we can put one out that, you know, just says, Make America Great Again, and that's available at TheAlexShowStore.com.
[02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:17.969]  But I personally like this one.
[02:21:18.549 --> 02:21:23.229]  Murdered out, it fits great, and it funds the info war and supports President Trump.
[02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:26.299]  And if you don't like Murdered Out, we got it white on black.

[02:21:58.149 --> 02:22:00.909]  Dale Comstock, a very well-known, famous...
[02:22:03.960 --> 02:22:16.079]  We're good to go.
[02:22:43.149 --> 02:22:46.350]  I'm concerned that the deep state...
[02:22:46.659 --> 02:22:47.479]  Let them in.
[02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:48.159]  We know they have.
[02:22:48.579 --> 02:22:56.100]  Or the deep state could actually stage some stuff, say they did it, as an even bigger pretext, and use total war to then lock everything down here.
[02:22:56.159 --> 02:23:02.680]  There's so many scenarios, but this is what you do, is looking at those from all your experience, you got caught up on the break going into scenarios.
[02:23:03.100 --> 02:23:05.579]  We left off with this foreign...
[02:23:06.200 --> 02:23:15.360]  Military-age man infiltration, and then the secret memos you're getting from the FBI saying they're after you, and then you actually witness them casing your place, your neighbors do.
[02:23:15.579 --> 02:23:21.500]  I mean, this is a serious situation, because obviously they don't like you, because I saw one of your nicknames as the CIA's Grim Reaper.
[02:23:22.379 --> 02:23:24.840]  Yeah, unfortunately, that wasn't my doing.
[02:23:25.139 --> 02:23:29.659]  But no, actually, I have a friend who's a former Green Beret, lives in my neighborhood in Florida.
[02:23:30.020 --> 02:23:36.639]  And he called me, told me he's seen people snooping around my garage, around my house, very shady characters.
[02:23:36.819 --> 02:23:38.860]  In fact, he was also, his wife was targeted.
[02:23:40.729 --> 02:23:41.729]  For a kidnapping attempt.
[02:23:42.350 --> 02:23:50.309]  Also, again, with a foreign entity that he apparently had a beef with, but he literally tried to grab his wife and throw her into a van one night.
[02:23:50.649 --> 02:23:52.170]  And he's been watching my property.
[02:23:52.170 --> 02:23:55.649]  He notified me that he believes they're out looking for me.
[02:23:55.750 --> 02:24:00.389]  In fact, law enforcement has been alerted in my hometown, so they're supposed to be stepping up the patrols.
[02:24:00.450 --> 02:24:03.030]  But it's not even just my hometown here in the United States.
[02:24:03.129 --> 02:24:07.899]  It's also abroad where I live, which I try not to Revealed too much where I'm at at any one particular time.
[02:24:08.020 --> 02:24:09.799]  In fact, I live out of a suitcase most of the time.
[02:24:10.379 --> 02:24:11.139]  But they're here.
[02:24:11.420 --> 02:24:13.200]  They've come across the border, obviously.
[02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:17.719]  And this should be very concerning to Americans, because where's this gonna go to next?
[02:24:17.899 --> 02:24:19.280]  Years ago, I had a lawyer call me.
[02:24:19.379 --> 02:24:20.340]  He was writing a book.
[02:24:21.649 --> 02:24:28.629]  And he was asking me, would the future look like in America, the way it's going, and particularly if we start getting terrorists coming into our country?
[02:24:28.690 --> 02:24:29.549]  Well, we have two problems.
[02:24:29.850 --> 02:24:31.469]  One, we have terrorists coming across the border.
[02:24:31.629 --> 02:24:34.610]  And two, we raised our own terrorists in this country, and they're not veterans.
[02:24:34.930 --> 02:24:35.950]  Okay, they're not veterans.
[02:24:36.129 --> 02:24:38.649]  There's these lunatics on the left, okay?
[02:24:38.829 --> 02:24:41.649]  The ones that go out and attempt to assassinate Trump.
[02:24:41.790 --> 02:24:46.760]  And by the way, I'm not really- Sure, those guys just went and did that on their own volition.
[02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:49.540]  I believe they were coached and groomed to do that.
[02:24:49.899 --> 02:24:52.719]  And we had whistleblowers from the Secret Service.
[02:24:52.719 --> 02:24:53.260]  They stood down.
[02:24:53.959 --> 02:24:56.100]  Yeah, so there's some shady stuff going on.
[02:24:56.180 --> 02:24:57.260]  But here's the biggest problem, right?
[02:24:57.459 --> 02:24:58.700]  Nobody trusts the US government.
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:04.239]  There's some good guys at the field level, online level, FBI agents out in the field.
[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:10.020]  But when you look at the executive C-suite level managers, those are guys you can't be trusted, none of them.
[02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:18.540]  I mean, I'm looking at all your documents here on the desk, and whistleblower reveals James Comey had FBI honeypot, spies infiltrate drums.
[02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:20.219]  Okay, yeah, that's very believable.
[02:25:20.399 --> 02:25:22.120]  I had him do it to me.
[02:25:22.950 --> 02:25:24.270]  I mean, literally.
[02:25:25.770 --> 02:25:27.430]  It's like a whole book just that.
[02:25:27.729 --> 02:25:29.729]  So, how do we trust this government?
[02:25:29.889 --> 02:25:30.930]  We cannot trust this government.
[02:25:31.049 --> 02:25:36.850]  And the problem is, we as American citizens, we forget the government works for us.
[02:25:36.969 --> 02:25:41.899]  And it's time To let them know you work for us and we're not going to be trifled with anymore.
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:44.520]  And so it's more than just voting, you know?
[02:25:44.700 --> 02:25:49.739]  And here's another thing I have to say about, you know, we mentioned it before the show, you know, the asylum majority, you know?
[02:25:50.879 --> 02:25:52.600]  Here's how I define the asylum majority.
[02:25:52.899 --> 02:25:53.219]  Cowards.
[02:25:53.340 --> 02:25:54.139]  You're cowards.
[02:25:54.260 --> 02:25:58.680]  If you call yourself the asylum majority and you're not speaking out, you go, well, I'm just going to vote.
[02:25:58.799 --> 02:26:01.079]  My question is, how did that work out for you the last time?
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:01.760]  It didn't.
[02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:02.200]  You know why?
[02:26:02.260 --> 02:26:03.760]  Because the squeaky wheel always gets the grease.
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:13.600]  And so we let these minorities, and when I say minorities, we're talking about these fringe groups out there that make a lot of noise, all the stuff that they want, and we don't want to be bothered with them.
[02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:15.760]  Like the trans agenda, wanting access to our kids.
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:17.280]  I mean, it's like a tiny cult.
[02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:19.899]  Exactly, and we just allow it to happen.
[02:26:20.159 --> 02:26:23.559]  And we try to tolerate stuff, but to what end?
[02:26:23.739 --> 02:26:27.239]  To the detriment of our children, to our lives, and to our freedom.
[02:26:27.459 --> 02:26:40.120]  It's time for Americans, and I'm going to say this besides the veterans as well, it's time for veterans to start leaning forward in a foxhole, start being heard, speak up, stop being trifled with.
[02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:45.010]  But the other thing is, the men in America, you know, I used to be a soldier.
[02:26:45.530 --> 02:26:46.530]  I'm no longer a soldier.
[02:26:46.649 --> 02:26:47.129]  I'm a warrior.
[02:26:47.450 --> 02:26:50.270]  And I believe every man in America should be a warrior.
[02:26:50.430 --> 02:26:53.909]  Even if you can't be a soldier, even if you weren't a soldier, you should at least be a warrior.
[02:26:54.010 --> 02:26:55.149]  Your job is to provide and protect.
[02:26:55.690 --> 02:27:01.750]  You know, stop sitting on your couch, going to work, flying to desk from 9 to 5, and letting somebody else take care of your problems.
[02:27:01.989 --> 02:27:02.870]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:27:03.010 --> 02:27:05.530]  The whole world is war, different types of war.
[02:27:05.709 --> 02:27:07.389]  You gotta fight for the culture that's the best.
[02:27:07.530 --> 02:27:08.370]  You gotta stand up for your family.
[02:27:08.389 --> 02:27:09.229]  You gotta work hard.
[02:27:09.489 --> 02:27:12.590]  And the men in America have been asleep and just think, I'm gonna go play golf.
[02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:13.750]  That's somebody else's job.
[02:27:13.889 --> 02:27:14.809]  People thank me all the time.
[02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:16.969]  Oh, thanks for doing our job for us.
[02:27:17.090 --> 02:27:21.370]  I'm like, it's the default that you've got to be engaged in society.
[02:27:21.629 --> 02:27:23.010]  That's what builds a good civilization.
[02:27:23.250 --> 02:27:26.489]  But if you're not engaged, the evil people are engaged and they'll take over.
[02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:27.270]  Absolutely.
[02:27:27.409 --> 02:27:28.549]  That's why every man's a warrior.
[02:27:28.870 --> 02:27:30.010]  You need to act like one.
[02:27:30.170 --> 02:27:32.709]  You need to stand up and protect your family.
[02:27:33.030 --> 02:27:34.110]  That's why I'm here today.
[02:27:34.290 --> 02:27:38.250]  I'm here today to protect my family, particularly my wife.
[02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:43.719]  And I'm also here to speak on behalf of Americans, okay, the real Americans, not the pseudo-Americans.
[02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:44.959]  Okay, there's a difference.
[02:27:45.420 --> 02:27:48.559]  Americans, those of us that believe in the Constitution, they're real Americans.
[02:27:48.639 --> 02:27:53.620]  The pseudo-Americans are the ones that just go, I'm American by birth, but I don't believe in anything that we do.
[02:27:53.799 --> 02:27:55.020]  Well, I don't believe in the Constitution.
[02:27:55.020 --> 02:27:56.319]  That's a pseudo-American to me.
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:27:58.139]  Okay, that's what I consider the left.
[02:27:58.280 --> 02:27:59.920]  And there's no distinction.
[02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:05.719]  I heard Charlie Crook say the other day, there's a difference between liberals and left wing and Democrats.
[02:28:05.719 --> 02:28:07.159]  Actually, I'll lump them all in the same group.
[02:28:07.299 --> 02:28:08.100]  I mean, they're no different.
[02:28:08.350 --> 02:28:09.190]  They're all part of the same cult.
[02:28:09.309 --> 02:28:10.329]  They're all giving each other support.
[02:28:10.489 --> 02:28:11.170]  They're all the same cult.
[02:28:11.309 --> 02:28:12.309]  And they are the enemy within.
[02:28:12.530 --> 02:28:13.469]  Sorry, but they're the enemy within.
[02:28:13.750 --> 02:28:15.930]  They're the same people I took an oath to defend from.
[02:28:16.250 --> 02:28:17.530]  All enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:19.790]  And there's no statute of limitations on that oath.
[02:28:19.930 --> 02:28:20.610]  Not for any of us.
[02:28:20.610 --> 02:28:21.930]  They don't even believe the country should exist.
[02:28:22.649 --> 02:28:22.969]  Exactly.
[02:28:23.350 --> 02:28:24.250]  And it's my country.
[02:28:24.290 --> 02:28:24.909]  I fought for it.
[02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:25.950]  My father fought for it.
[02:28:25.950 --> 02:28:27.270]  My son fights for it.
[02:28:27.329 --> 02:28:28.870]  My family has fought for this country.
[02:28:28.969 --> 02:28:31.329]  We've actually spilled blood for this country.
[02:28:31.469 --> 02:28:38.850]  And I would argue, everybody that's out there pissing and moaning about equality and equity and blah, blah, blah.
[02:28:39.010 --> 02:28:40.389]  What have you done for our country?
[02:28:40.450 --> 02:28:42.989]  Don't say you pay taxes, because most people don't actually pay taxes.
[02:28:43.250 --> 02:28:45.889]  Most people just pay Social Security and Medicare if they pay anything at all.
[02:28:46.470 --> 02:28:48.350]  How many people are actually really paying taxes?
[02:28:48.510 --> 02:28:49.809]  What have you done for your country?
[02:28:50.489 --> 02:28:54.889]  We've got law enforcement, we've got EMT, we've got doctors and nurses.
[02:28:55.090 --> 02:28:56.750]  Okay, they're doing something for our country.
[02:28:57.250 --> 02:29:01.790]  Others, yeah, you're doing something to some degree, but what kind of sacrifice have you made for this country?
[02:29:02.399 --> 02:29:08.540]  Not too many, but you sit there, you want to disparage, you want to take it down, you want to call it bad, you want to call this fascist?
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:12.020]  Really, you're gonna call me a fascist because my skin is white?
[02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:15.559]  By the way, I didn't mention on the show, my wife is Indonesian, she's Muslim.
[02:29:15.899 --> 02:29:19.520]  Yeah, I've got three black children, a Hispanic child and an Asian child.
[02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:24.420]  But I'll call the fascist and the racist because, oh yeah, garbage.
[02:29:24.540 --> 02:29:25.739]  Isn't that what Biden called me too?
[02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:27.100]  Because I support Trump.
[02:29:27.299 --> 02:29:28.540]  In fact, my whole family supports Trump.
[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:31.239]  In fact, let's play the Biden garbage clip.
[02:29:31.399 --> 02:29:32.319]  You can't play that enough.
[02:29:32.379 --> 02:29:34.860]  I want to get into the big breaking election fraud news and get your take on that.
[02:29:35.620 --> 02:29:42.299]  By the way, about an hour ago, I learned this news and then I had to, during the breaks, double check it all.
[02:29:42.379 --> 02:29:43.440]  It's all confirmed.
[02:29:46.020 --> 02:29:55.120]  Very few things make me where it's so huge that I just got chills when I just put my brain back into it.
[02:29:55.920 --> 02:29:57.379]  This is so crazy.
[02:30:01.229 --> 02:30:03.069]  That the top of my head just blew off.
[02:30:03.170 --> 02:30:04.129]  I'm not even angry.
[02:30:04.329 --> 02:30:06.229]  I'm just like, because I know what it is.
[02:30:06.489 --> 02:30:19.090]  This Soros witch, one of the worst in the country that's committed so many crimes in Michigan and ensured the fraud and blocked the lawsuits, and then when they lost the lawsuits, they were going to keep 500,000 non-voters on the damn rolls.
[02:30:19.309 --> 02:30:20.049]  That's public!
[02:30:21.270 --> 02:30:29.430]  She just literally came out and said, there's hundreds of thousands of fake votes and we are not going to do anything about it and live with it.
[02:30:30.889 --> 02:30:32.250]  In the Dominion machines.
[02:30:33.510 --> 02:30:34.709]  And the report...
[02:30:34.709 --> 02:30:35.989]  Yeah, there she is with Hillary Clinton.
[02:30:36.229 --> 02:30:37.829]  And the reports are...
[02:30:37.829 --> 02:30:39.190]  She literally works for Soros.
[02:30:39.389 --> 02:30:44.090]  The reports are pouring in across the country of their damn machines.
[02:30:44.649 --> 02:30:53.209]  And all I did two weeks ago with MTG, Congressman Martin Charlie Green, was she said her constituents were giving her reports of the machines flipping.
[02:30:54.700 --> 02:30:56.440]  And we didn't even say Dominion.
[02:30:56.940 --> 02:31:00.340]  And they started threatening to sue us all over the news in America.
[02:31:00.459 --> 02:31:01.479]  And then now this.
[02:31:01.600 --> 02:31:03.559]  And the woman sits up there when I play the video.
[02:31:04.219 --> 02:31:05.500]  It's going to make your blood boil.
[02:31:05.780 --> 02:31:07.860]  Just arrogantly going, this is the way it is.
[02:31:08.180 --> 02:31:11.260]  I mean, they're trying to demoralize us and break our will.
[02:31:11.399 --> 02:31:13.139]  And I know, folks, it's the opposite.
[02:31:13.399 --> 02:31:16.020]  It works on some people say, oh, we shouldn't vote because there's fraud.
[02:31:16.159 --> 02:31:19.940]  No, you vote to prove the fraud to overpower their asses.
[02:31:20.020 --> 02:31:20.680]  You got a view on that?
[02:31:21.239 --> 02:31:21.959]  I agree.
[02:31:22.200 --> 02:31:32.040]  And so, you know, there's got to be, you know, it's not just voting because there's got to be consequences, you know, and I believe they're going to steal the election again.
[02:31:32.299 --> 02:31:35.120]  And when people go, there's no proof they stole the election last time.
[02:31:35.260 --> 02:31:38.139]  Anybody with one life brain cell knows that election was stolen.
[02:31:38.260 --> 02:31:40.280]  I mean, you could watch the graphs and et cetera, et cetera.
[02:31:40.440 --> 02:31:40.600]  Yeah.
[02:31:41.020 --> 02:31:42.219]  Graphs don't, don't, don't.
[02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:44.159]  Graphs are organic and rounded.
[02:31:44.299 --> 02:31:44.620]  They don't.
[02:31:45.059 --> 02:31:48.739]  Oh, we closed the polling place and they cover up the windows and it goes boop.
[02:31:48.770 --> 02:31:49.909]  And all these states straight up.
[02:31:49.969 --> 02:31:50.290]  Absolutely.
[02:31:50.409 --> 02:31:51.030]  They stole it.
[02:31:51.170 --> 02:31:52.389]  You know, they're in denial.
[02:31:52.610 --> 02:31:54.729]  But, you know, there's got to be consequences.
[02:31:54.790 --> 02:31:58.170]  And I hope this time, if Trump does get elected, he's not Mr.
[02:31:58.229 --> 02:32:00.610]  Nice Guy, you know, let's Hillary off the hook and everybody else.
[02:32:00.909 --> 02:32:02.329]  You can't, because it's like cancer.
[02:32:02.530 --> 02:32:03.209]  No, you got it.
[02:32:03.270 --> 02:32:04.329]  There's got to be consequences.
[02:32:04.729 --> 02:32:06.309]  And what they're doing is treasonous.
[02:32:06.510 --> 02:32:10.909]  And what they're doing is depriving me and my family of our vote and our freedoms.
[02:32:11.309 --> 02:32:12.149]  They're robbing you.
[02:32:12.270 --> 02:32:12.790]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:32:12.889 --> 02:32:13.610]  They're enslaving us.
[02:32:13.829 --> 02:32:14.370]  No, exactly.
[02:32:14.569 --> 02:32:16.430]  And I look at it like this, you know.
[02:32:18.049 --> 02:32:19.270]  Why are we so divided?
[02:32:19.729 --> 02:32:21.209]  There's a lot of reasons we're divided.
[02:32:21.389 --> 02:32:22.389]  There's a bigger agenda.
[02:32:22.829 --> 02:32:23.569]  Psychological warfare.
[02:32:23.809 --> 02:32:24.110]  Absolutely.
[02:32:24.309 --> 02:32:25.209]  Everything is propaganda.
[02:32:25.489 --> 02:32:26.229]  Everything is propaganda.
[02:32:26.450 --> 02:32:28.389]  In fact, we're in fifth generation warfare right now.
[02:32:28.809 --> 02:32:32.149]  We're in a war that's not just in America, but it's global.
[02:32:32.450 --> 02:32:33.690]  And it's fifth generation warfare.
[02:32:33.909 --> 02:32:35.690]  It's a psychological warfare.
[02:32:35.870 --> 02:32:36.750]  It's information warfare.
[02:32:37.129 --> 02:32:39.110]  And they're pretty good at it.
[02:32:39.149 --> 02:32:40.409]  And they're leveraging very well.
[02:32:40.909 --> 02:32:43.670]  And unfortunately, it's a big machine.
[02:32:43.930 --> 02:32:44.770]  And I think...
[02:32:45.370 --> 02:32:54.829]  If we're not careful, we're going to lose the war, again, unless somebody's going to be held accountable, and that's what has to happen.
[02:32:54.969 --> 02:32:56.649]  If Trump wins, people have to be held accountable.
[02:32:56.829 --> 02:32:58.250]  It's not just a slap on the wrist.
[02:32:58.329 --> 02:32:59.850]  It's not vengeance.
[02:33:00.409 --> 02:33:01.850]  It's our responsibility.
[02:33:02.049 --> 02:33:02.350]  Absolutely.
[02:33:02.790 --> 02:33:04.569]  And so they're coming after us for doing nothing.
[02:33:05.420 --> 02:33:06.479]  They've committed all these crimes.
[02:33:06.620 --> 02:33:07.559]  They must be prosecuted.
[02:33:07.639 --> 02:33:09.379]  Well, you know what they're trying to do now, right?
[02:33:09.479 --> 02:33:12.559]  Oh, he's going to put everybody in concentration camps and jail people.
[02:33:12.680 --> 02:33:17.340]  Well, that's them trying to, they're already trying to set this up, going, see, I told you they're going to lock us up.
[02:33:17.500 --> 02:33:20.799]  No, he's going to lock you up because you're liars and cheaters and criminals.
[02:33:23.059 --> 02:33:27.440]  We need to give him trials, what Bukele did in El Salvador.
[02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:30.360]  I mean, this country has cancer.
[02:33:30.500 --> 02:33:31.120]  It's got to be cut out.
[02:33:31.299 --> 02:33:31.860]  It does.
[02:33:32.139 --> 02:33:36.579]  And again, the government's supposed to work for us, and they're manipulating us.
[02:33:36.639 --> 02:33:42.520]  The fact that they've just outright lied to us, and most people just go along with it, is unbelievable.
[02:33:42.860 --> 02:33:44.159]  And there's a term for that.
[02:33:44.280 --> 02:33:45.299]  There's many terms.
[02:33:46.059 --> 02:33:46.459]  Gaslighting?
[02:33:46.620 --> 02:33:47.680]  Well, gaslighting.
[02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:52.479]  Mass hypnosis, psychosis, where you say, Hitler did this.
[02:33:52.520 --> 02:33:53.700]  This was Hitler's thing.
[02:33:54.159 --> 02:33:57.719]  You repeat a lie enough times, we didn't It's 30 to 60 days, everybody believes it.
[02:33:57.739 --> 02:33:58.559]  Two men can have a baby.
[02:33:58.760 --> 02:34:08.739]  Right, and then you have information escalation bias where you go, no, no, here's the facts, and nobody wants to believe it because they're so brainwashed in believing the lie that they can't backtrack on it.
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:11.379]  So it is psychological warfare.
[02:34:11.659 --> 02:34:18.860]  The people on the top, they know what they're doing, they understand the human condition, they know how to manipulate it, and everybody allows themselves to be manipulated.
[02:34:19.299 --> 02:34:21.500]  And this is why they're winning.
[02:34:21.659 --> 02:34:32.219]  However, I gotta hand it to the right, they've done a really good job at Running a counter-campaign, counter-propaganda campaign, and it's not actually not propaganda, it's just a true campaign, right?
[02:34:32.379 --> 02:34:34.139]  It's truth is what they're doing, and they're winning.
[02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:40.739]  But I believe, and I think most people do, they're going to try to steal this election again, and this goes back to what I said earlier.
[02:34:40.819 --> 02:34:41.840]  Well, it's now happening.
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:43.500]  There's no question they're doing it.
[02:34:43.530 --> 02:34:49.610]  Yeah, and next step, I still believe, you know, and again, I really hope I'm wrong on this, but I believe something severe is going to happen.
[02:34:49.750 --> 02:34:51.069]  It's going to be another assassination attempt.
[02:34:51.209 --> 02:34:55.870]  There's going to be something to give them reason to pause everything, to pause the transition of power.
[02:34:56.690 --> 02:34:58.770]  Well, Dale, I think it's going to be a false flag blame on transporters.
[02:34:58.850 --> 02:34:59.670]  That's what's pre-programmed.
[02:34:59.979 --> 02:35:03.420]  False flag, or it could be, like I said, a real threat against Trump and his family.
[02:35:03.739 --> 02:35:05.719]  I think that's very viable, very doable.
[02:35:06.219 --> 02:35:11.000]  Well, yeah, since we mentioned it, here is Biden with the garbage comment.
[02:35:11.180 --> 02:35:11.940]  Can't play that enough.
[02:35:12.079 --> 02:35:12.739]  We only played it once today.
[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:17.659]  And then I want to play you the Secretary of State, the Soros operative, Jocelyn Benson.
[02:35:18.020 --> 02:35:20.600]  And for listeners, this is ABC News, CBS News.
[02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:21.159]  It's all over.
[02:35:21.379 --> 02:35:25.860]  They're like, yeah, we don't know where these hundreds of thousands of non-votes are, but it's the way it is.
[02:35:26.319 --> 02:35:28.139]  So here's Biden.
[02:35:29.329 --> 02:35:34.329]  Puerto Rico, where I'm in my home state of Delaware, they're good, decent, honorable people.
[02:35:34.610 --> 02:35:37.450]  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.
[02:35:37.790 --> 02:35:41.930]  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.
[02:35:43.090 --> 02:35:52.190]  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.
[02:35:52.430 --> 02:35:54.350]  Including, yes, Puerto Rico.
[02:36:04.020 --> 02:36:05.860]  Well, I'd take that guy for a swim out there.
[02:36:06.420 --> 02:36:06.819]  Anyway.
[02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:09.440]  And threats on top of it.
[02:36:09.639 --> 02:36:10.520]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:36:12.159 --> 02:36:14.100]  This is Arch Commander-in-Chief, right?
[02:36:14.200 --> 02:36:17.180]  This is the guy we're supposed to trust and we're supposed to follow.
[02:36:17.440 --> 02:36:21.440]  And I want to caveat, I wanted to say this earlier, but I'm gonna interject it real quick.
[02:36:21.780 --> 02:36:27.180]  I remember one time he got on television and he made a comment about AR-15s.
[02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:29.600]  He said, your AR-15 can't stop an F-15.
[02:36:30.020 --> 02:36:35.520]  Nobody ever comes on the media and says what I'm about to say, but I'm gonna say it because I think people need to be aware.
[02:36:36.340 --> 02:36:40.059]  I wanna empower people, let them understand what's possible.
[02:36:40.319 --> 02:36:43.159]  As I mentioned a minute ago, the government works for us.
[02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:43.940]  Don't forget that.
[02:36:44.260 --> 02:36:48.770]  When he said, your AR-15 can't stop an F-15, Here's the news.
[02:36:49.170 --> 02:36:51.129]  Our AR-15s don't have to stop an F-15.
[02:36:51.270 --> 02:36:52.290]  Doesn't have to stop a tank.
[02:36:52.530 --> 02:36:53.569]  Doesn't have to do any of that.
[02:36:53.649 --> 02:36:54.469]  You know what it has to stop?
[02:36:54.629 --> 02:36:56.549]  It has to stop his support mechanism.
[02:36:56.770 --> 02:36:57.729]  It has to stop his family.
[02:36:57.969 --> 02:36:59.870]  That's what we call unconventional warfare.
[02:37:00.010 --> 02:37:02.930]  And I know that's pretty dark, but that's the reality of combat.
[02:37:03.209 --> 02:37:07.409]  When you look at where we are today in Afghanistan, I've lost a lot of soldiers over there.
[02:37:07.610 --> 02:37:10.549]  And not only have I lost my soldiers, but I've lost their families.
[02:37:10.790 --> 02:37:14.549]  Because Taliban, they're not gonna go after the guys that were fighting for us.
[02:37:14.959 --> 02:37:16.180]  They're gonna go after their families.
[02:37:16.319 --> 02:37:18.020]  And that's what's gonna happen in this country.
[02:37:18.479 --> 02:37:20.079]  So war's an ugly thing.
[02:37:20.180 --> 02:37:21.500]  We never wanna go down that road.
[02:37:21.979 --> 02:37:23.540]  You don't wanna go down that road.
[02:37:23.819 --> 02:37:27.000]  But I feel like we have a government that's gonna push us to that end.
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:29.020]  And I got bad news for the U.S. government.
[02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:37.100]  If they think that American soldiers, Marines, Rangers, infantry are gonna turn their weapons on American citizenry, it's not gonna happen.
[02:37:37.239 --> 02:37:38.280]  They're not gonna do it.
[02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:43.870]  And they've had movies like Civil War to program that it's a good thing, but so let me bring this up.
[02:37:43.889 --> 02:37:47.129]  I'm not a soldier, but I've said a little bit of history and had a few live experiences.
[02:37:47.270 --> 02:37:47.750]  I'm gonna explain something.
[02:37:48.659 --> 02:37:55.059]  We're not calling for violence, but Swallowswell and other Democrats and Biden saying, we've got nuclear weapons, like Swallowswell said.
[02:37:55.280 --> 02:37:56.739]  Well, that's to blow up whole cities.
[02:37:56.780 --> 02:37:58.379]  And if the cities are blue, they're blowing up their own people.
[02:37:58.600 --> 02:38:02.459]  You don't use nuclear weapons to stop a rebellion.
[02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:07.340]  And so I don't even need an AR-15 to take an airbase.
[02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:09.180]  I need a ball-peen hammer.
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:14.840]  And you come up, I'm not saying do this, and you take the gun from the guy with the ball-peen hammer.
[02:38:14.940 --> 02:38:18.540]  In fact, I may have a gun, but I'm going to use the hammer because I don't want any noise, or a knife.
[02:38:19.150 --> 02:38:23.790]  And continuing with that, absolutely, it's ridiculous, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:23.989 --> 02:38:27.989]  And then let's say they're using F-15s on us, which the troops wouldn't do, but it's going to be drones.
[02:38:28.209 --> 02:38:29.750]  Well, we know where the drone bases are.
[02:38:29.829 --> 02:38:31.110]  We know where their supply fields are.
[02:38:31.209 --> 02:38:33.010]  And so it's all a big joke.
[02:38:33.849 --> 02:38:35.750]  And the North Vietnamese didn't want to give up.
[02:38:35.850 --> 02:38:37.549]  How did we do in a 10-year war with them?
[02:38:38.049 --> 02:38:39.090]  Because they wouldn't give up.
[02:38:39.190 --> 02:38:40.750]  So I want to just warn the globalists.
[02:38:40.829 --> 02:38:44.030]  I know a lot of them are lawyers, never been in a fight, or haven't studied military history.
[02:38:44.409 --> 02:38:45.170]  You're fools.
[02:38:45.270 --> 02:38:46.530]  And I've told the feds this.
[02:38:46.610 --> 02:38:48.889]  If you really want to start your civil war and everything, we don't want to go there.
[02:38:49.069 --> 02:38:50.750]  But you've entered our briar patch.
[02:38:50.829 --> 02:38:51.510]  Is that what you're trying to say?
[02:38:51.670 --> 02:38:51.950]  Absolutely.
[02:38:52.309 --> 02:38:54.030]  This is our war, not yours.
[02:38:54.729 --> 02:38:55.629]  They don't want to go there.
[02:38:55.750 --> 02:38:57.129]  And actually, globally...
[02:38:57.389 --> 02:39:03.090]  You know, and I've told my friends in these foreign countries, I said, if America falls, you're gonna fall soon after.
[02:39:03.270 --> 02:39:04.250]  It's like a domino effect.
[02:39:04.549 --> 02:39:11.809]  And what's funny is a lot of my friends that were very anti-Trump during his reign are now very pro-Trump because they see the writing on the wall.
[02:39:11.889 --> 02:39:15.590]  They're like, oh, geez, I hope he makes it because they know we're all gonna be in trouble.
[02:39:15.829 --> 02:39:20.149]  Globally, we're gonna be in trouble because it's just not an American phenomenon.
[02:39:20.250 --> 02:39:21.370]  It's a global phenomenon.
[02:39:23.010 --> 02:39:24.350]  And again, you didn't say that.
[02:39:24.530 --> 02:39:26.750]  I'm not reading your mind, but tell me if I'm wrong, to act tough.
[02:39:27.229 --> 02:39:43.870]  You're warning the establishment who are delusional that they don't know anything about resistance, they don't know anything about asymmetrical warfare, and they're acting like complete fools, and they keep thinking they're going to pre-program a civil war where we get tricked during this and black kills white.
[02:39:44.010 --> 02:39:44.750]  Yeah, there'll be some of that.
[02:39:44.850 --> 02:39:48.969]  They'll try to make that look like that's why that's happening, but it's us against the establishment.
[02:39:50.129 --> 02:39:52.049]  And it'll be like moose hunting licenses.
[02:39:52.229 --> 02:39:53.389]  I mean, let's say it actually goes to violence.
[02:39:53.649 --> 02:39:56.549]  You know, only like one out of 20 gets the license to hunt a moose.
[02:39:56.649 --> 02:39:57.270]  There's not that many.
[02:39:58.149 --> 02:40:00.270]  Globalist will be like a moose in hunting season.
[02:40:00.709 --> 02:40:02.569]  I mean, you don't want to be one of them.
[02:40:02.750 --> 02:40:11.010]  No, and actually, to your point, I actually want to educate the public and empower you, let you know that you don't have to be a victim to the machine.
[02:40:11.870 --> 02:40:13.610]  The machine can be broken very easy.
[02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:14.690]  You don't have to even break the machine.
[02:40:14.790 --> 02:40:15.569]  You just got to break the operator.
[02:40:15.709 --> 02:40:16.190]  Yeah, let's see.
[02:40:16.270 --> 02:40:17.149]  They release a new virus.
[02:40:17.290 --> 02:40:17.889]  There's lockdowns.
[02:40:17.950 --> 02:40:23.489]  They're coming to grab people that speak out and put them in a camp, which they say all the world are going to do now under the UN offices under the next pandemic.
[02:40:24.389 --> 02:40:25.250]  We don't want this.
[02:40:25.370 --> 02:40:25.909]  We're not going there.
[02:40:26.010 --> 02:40:30.030]  But let's say they're driving around and they're sending groups to grab people out of their houses.
[02:40:30.610 --> 02:40:33.510]  No one's going to be waiting for them in their house, folks.
[02:40:34.190 --> 02:40:35.870]  Okay, where are those trucks coming from?
[02:40:36.090 --> 02:40:38.770]  Where are those trucks coming down the road?
[02:40:38.870 --> 02:40:40.569]  I mean, come on, people.
[02:40:40.829 --> 02:40:44.670]  I mean, it's just this much military knowledge and we'll know we've got all the power.
[02:40:45.059 --> 02:40:45.379]  Absolutely.
[02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:50.159]  Well, look, the British tried to take Afghanistan, and they couldn't do it.
[02:40:50.219 --> 02:40:54.700]  The Russians got their butt handed to them by the Mujahideen, guys in flip-flops and AK-47s.
[02:40:55.239 --> 02:40:55.760]  Guess what?
[02:40:55.840 --> 02:40:57.319]  The US military didn't do that well either.
[02:40:57.479 --> 02:41:01.899]  And I'll tell you why the US military didn't do that well, because we were there for 20 years.
[02:41:02.020 --> 02:41:02.860]  People were making money.
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:09.280]  They didn't want to win the war, because if they wanted to win the war, they would have fought They would have fought the guerrillas with unconventional warfare.
[02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:12.120]  They would have used guerrilla tactics to fight the Taliban.
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:15.620]  Instead, they wanted to fight an unconventional warfare with conventional forces.
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:17.819]  All right, we sacrifice a lot of people.
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:20.299]  Well, that was the Pentagon plan, though, is to sap American resources.
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:21.840]  Well, that's exactly what happened, right?
[02:41:22.059 --> 02:41:26.379]  So, you know, you can never, a conventional army will never defeat an unconventional army.
[02:41:26.819 --> 02:41:28.020]  It just won't happen.
[02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:29.680]  So that's what we're talking about here.
[02:41:29.840 --> 02:41:35.559]  When Joe Biden says he'll send his F-15s against our AR-15s, your F-15s will lose.
[02:41:35.719 --> 02:41:37.920]  And it won't be because we're going to shoot your planes down.
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:44.239]  It's because we're going to shoot the support mechanism behind the pilots, behind the tankers, and everybody else pushing the buttons.
[02:41:45.379 --> 02:41:46.520]  That's what warfare is.
[02:41:46.559 --> 02:41:47.760]  That's what Green Berets do.
[02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:49.260]  We are force multipliers.
[02:41:49.420 --> 02:41:50.200]  There's plenty of us out there.
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:51.219]  We understand this thing.
[02:41:51.760 --> 02:41:53.360]  And so, you know, I can...
[02:41:53.360 --> 02:41:54.940]  Only one guy with 100 rounds...
[02:41:55.459 --> 02:41:57.899]  Ken could take out 10 planes.
[02:41:58.139 --> 02:41:58.739]  He could.
[02:41:58.899 --> 02:41:59.379]  On the ground.
[02:41:59.579 --> 02:41:59.920]  On the tarmac.
[02:42:00.120 --> 02:42:01.100]  In fact, he could do it with drones.
[02:42:01.219 --> 02:42:02.139]  There's a lot of ways to do it.
[02:42:02.620 --> 02:42:04.020]  We're not talking about that.
[02:42:04.219 --> 02:42:07.719]  They're the ones dreaming of their fantasy war with us.
[02:42:08.780 --> 02:42:09.579]  I want to explain.
[02:42:09.579 --> 02:42:10.479]  It doesn't work that way.
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:11.639]  No, absolutely not.
[02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:13.479]  And we don't want to go there.
[02:42:13.620 --> 02:42:14.520]  We don't want to have a war.
[02:42:15.020 --> 02:42:18.299]  You know, look, I think all Americans inherently are good.
[02:42:18.639 --> 02:42:21.639]  Even a lot of knuckleheads on the left, they're just misinformed.
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:23.020]  They've been brainwashed.
[02:42:23.399 --> 02:42:28.319]  But I think at the end of the day, we have been literally pitted against each other going all the way back.
[02:42:28.340 --> 02:42:34.100]  So how do we stop that and then be, because I tell the law enforcement knows this, a lot of feds are good, like compartmentalized.
[02:42:35.019 --> 02:42:36.500]  The globalists are trying to get us in a fight.
[02:42:36.899 --> 02:42:38.479]  How do we stop that from happening?
[02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:41.780]  And then B, God forbid they kick it off, they're in a stage and try to get it going.
[02:42:42.959 --> 02:42:47.860]  I want to explain to all patriots, your target is not the police and not all that other stuff.
[02:42:48.260 --> 02:42:50.719]  That would be the worst possible scenario.
[02:42:51.319 --> 02:42:53.360]  It's the head of the snake, which we're not calling for.
[02:42:53.440 --> 02:42:55.059]  We're just saying how this methodology works.
[02:42:55.319 --> 02:43:00.040]  Yeah, you know, it really, if you look at, you know, this goes way, way back.
[02:43:00.239 --> 02:43:03.020]  But at the end of the day, it comes down to the family, I think, you know.
[02:43:03.950 --> 02:43:06.850]  The lack of fathers in the home, the lack of teachers, education.
[02:43:07.389 --> 02:43:08.930]  Fathers and mothers are the teachers.
[02:43:09.090 --> 02:43:17.930]  And we've relegated our children to a public school that's 97% liberals teaching it, brainwashing our children, exposing them to all kinds of weird stuff.
[02:43:18.110 --> 02:43:23.899]  And it's no wonder that the next generation has grown up to be Completely out of touch.
[02:43:24.120 --> 02:43:27.239]  So I think, hopefully, Trump makes it, which I think he will.
[02:43:27.579 --> 02:43:29.239]  He changes the education system.
[02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:42.360]  We get rid of some of these left-wing professors and teachers and replace them with people that are there to do one thing and actually teach kids the ABCs, writing rhythm, taking those types of things and not all those liberal brainwashing.
[02:43:42.479 --> 02:43:44.100]  And how to cook food, how to change a tire?
[02:43:44.299 --> 02:43:45.600]  Exactly, man.
[02:43:45.739 --> 02:43:51.059]  Let's go back to living like families again and doing the traditional family life.
[02:43:51.219 --> 02:43:56.680]  Let's stop this divide between feminism and men and toxic masculinity and all this crap out there.
[02:43:56.819 --> 02:43:58.700]  They're intentionally dividing.
[02:43:58.719 --> 02:44:00.200]  Well, the CIA ran the feminist movement.
[02:44:00.299 --> 02:44:01.020]  That's declassified.
[02:44:01.139 --> 02:44:01.299]  Yeah.
[02:44:01.579 --> 02:44:05.579]  Well, you know, if you read Saul Selensky, you know, I mean, it's all there in the book.
[02:44:05.719 --> 02:44:08.920]  I mean, the Communist Manifesto, the entire plan is laid out for you.
[02:44:09.059 --> 02:44:10.340]  And then you don't have to believe us.
[02:44:10.479 --> 02:44:11.559]  It's a communist takeover.
[02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:15.879]  You read the Communist Manifesto or Rules for Radicals, you're like, my God, we're living this.
[02:44:16.059 --> 02:44:16.379]  Absolutely.
[02:44:16.799 --> 02:44:17.120]  Exactly.
[02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:18.559]  We're in the last phases of it.
[02:44:18.780 --> 02:44:20.360]  We're circling the bowl right now.
[02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:21.239]  We're about to go under.
[02:44:21.559 --> 02:44:23.500]  Dale Comstock, American badass.
[02:44:23.659 --> 02:44:27.379]  I know you like to tell military stories, but let's just talk about some of those in the campaign.
[02:44:27.379 --> 02:44:29.299]  I promise I'm going to get to all the big election news.
[02:44:30.389 --> 02:44:31.629]  In detail when we come back.
[02:44:32.049 --> 02:44:34.069]  I've talked about it some, but it is just...
[02:44:34.069 --> 02:44:34.510]  It is...
[02:44:36.430 --> 02:44:39.270]  It is so insane how they're just hiding this in plain view like it's no big deal.
[02:44:39.350 --> 02:44:42.989]  Like, oh yeah, there's hundreds of thousands of fake votes in the Dominion machines.
[02:44:43.129 --> 02:44:43.610]  It's the way it is.
[02:44:43.690 --> 02:44:44.270]  Kiss our ass.
[02:44:44.409 --> 02:44:45.649]  I mean, this is wild.
[02:44:45.930 --> 02:44:47.709]  But the good news is they can't hide it anymore.
[02:44:47.750 --> 02:44:48.750]  They're so desperate.
[02:44:48.950 --> 02:44:53.790]  This is the most ham-fisted, retarded theft I've ever seen.
[02:44:54.149 --> 02:44:56.090]  They're doing it in front of God, doing it in front of the world.
[02:44:56.129 --> 02:44:56.649]  We'll be right back.
[02:44:56.729 --> 02:44:57.450]  American Badass.
[02:44:57.649 --> 02:44:59.969]  You can find all that on his website we put on screen.
[02:44:59.969 --> 02:45:00.850]  But listen to me, folks.
[02:45:02.010 --> 02:45:03.030]  I need your support.
[02:45:03.209 --> 02:45:05.989]  We are 13 days away from them potentially shutting us down.
[02:45:06.889 --> 02:45:07.909]  Justice Department's running it all.
[02:45:08.389 --> 02:45:09.489]  We got backups.
[02:45:09.690 --> 02:45:10.290]  We got it all.
[02:45:10.450 --> 02:45:12.649]  But the tank's not even half full.
[02:45:12.909 --> 02:45:14.950]  I need to go into this fully back.
[02:45:15.090 --> 02:45:15.930]  Plus, we have great products.
[02:45:16.149 --> 02:45:18.530]  So, this is such a no-brainer.
[02:45:18.670 --> 02:45:19.350]  They hate my guts.
[02:45:19.469 --> 02:45:20.309]  The system's after me.
[02:45:20.450 --> 02:45:21.649]  We have all these great guests on.
[02:45:21.770 --> 02:45:43.770]  We reach tens of millions of new people a day, literally, We're good to go.
[02:45:48.810 --> 02:45:51.510]  TheAlexJonesStore.com And again, there's so many great products.
[02:45:51.610 --> 02:45:52.889]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:45:53.209 --> 02:45:55.629]  Now is the time to take action and support by that supplement company.
[02:45:55.729 --> 02:45:56.809]  He's a great backer as well.
[02:45:58.069 --> 02:46:00.569]  DRJonesNaturals.com Those are the coordinates of victory.
[02:46:00.930 --> 02:46:02.149]  They're coming after everybody.
[02:46:02.329 --> 02:46:03.110]  They're coming after Trump.
[02:46:03.229 --> 02:46:03.969]  They're coming after Kennedy.
[02:46:04.229 --> 02:46:05.069]  We need your support.
[02:46:05.069 --> 02:46:06.049]  And you don't even come here and do this.
[02:46:06.170 --> 02:46:07.549]  Alex, first of all, I want to thank you.
[02:46:07.629 --> 02:46:08.610]  Give to Alex Jones.
[02:46:08.809 --> 02:46:13.969]  I don't want this guy to have to be like wearing a symbol and we're all going to say, you know, the truth teller formerly known as Alex Jones.
[02:46:14.110 --> 02:46:15.250]  Let's not let that happen.
[02:46:15.530 --> 02:46:17.010]  Well, they're trying to make an example out of me.
[02:46:17.450 --> 02:46:19.989]  I'm not that important, but I've become a rallying point.
[02:46:20.149 --> 02:46:22.350]  I've become like a Roman standard they want to capture.
[02:46:22.510 --> 02:46:23.010]  Explain that.
[02:46:23.569 --> 02:46:32.450]  Look, I mean, if we don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the First Amendment, if, you know, media, which is, look, it never said only newspapers or the media.
[02:46:32.590 --> 02:46:41.469]  It was anyone that wants to challenge government, anyone that's willing to put the feet to the fire of corporate interests of your government, that is supposed to be free.
[02:46:41.629 --> 02:46:42.629]  Electronic soapbox.
[02:46:42.860 --> 02:46:46.860]  In the end, if you lose, Alex, we all lose.
[02:46:46.979 --> 02:46:52.840]  We will all lose the ability to do tough stories, to take risks, to plant flags where we think there's an issue.
[02:46:53.059 --> 02:46:54.100]  Sometime we'll get it wrong.
[02:46:54.260 --> 02:46:56.159]  I said before, you do a daily show.
[02:46:56.299 --> 02:46:58.059]  It's impossible to nail that to the wall.
[02:46:58.139 --> 02:46:59.100]  I do a weekly show.
[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:00.639]  I spend more time vetting it.
[02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:01.620]  They're two different animals.
[02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:02.780]  They can't be compared to each other.
[02:47:02.780 --> 02:47:04.159]  They also take stuff out of context.
[02:47:04.299 --> 02:47:04.780]  I'm exaggerating.
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:06.139]  Absolutely, that's true.
[02:47:06.280 --> 02:47:14.799]  You know, one of the things that makes you so spectacular, Alex, is long before any of us were here You were starting to talk about this deep state.
[02:47:14.979 --> 02:47:26.379]  You were talking about this, you know, a government that was supposed to be of, for and by the people that was being robbed from us by corporate interests, by special interests, by globalists, long before anybody else ever did.
[02:47:26.930 --> 02:47:31.889]  And to imagine you sitting here in this moment, we are in that impactful moment.
[02:47:32.010 --> 02:47:34.170]  And in many ways, not enough people are listening to you.
[02:47:34.350 --> 02:47:49.690]  And I want to say that, you know, I think the vaccine, and we've talked about this before, that was the tip of the spear of the final death blow, which was, if we can inject you and own your bodies, and own the bodies of your children, and pass laws that say that, you know, because of vaccinations,
[02:47:49.690 --> 02:47:51.750]  we've decided that we own your children.
[02:47:51.909 --> 02:47:52.750]  We make a decision.
[02:47:52.809 --> 02:47:54.190]  That's a revolutionary takeover.
[02:47:54.219 --> 02:48:02.979]  It was a revolutionary takeover, and so people like me got alarmed by that, and we joined forces with people like you that have been really talking about it for a long time.
[02:48:03.159 --> 02:48:06.040]  But I would say that we are at the very last stage.
[02:48:06.100 --> 02:48:10.120]  I was just speaking publicly, and this woman said, things don't happen that fast, Dale.
[02:48:10.239 --> 02:48:11.120]  You're being really dramatic.
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:13.440]  I don't think this election matters that much.
[02:48:13.690 --> 02:48:18.030]  I was like, that's because you're looking at this over the last year, maybe two years.
[02:48:18.209 --> 02:48:28.309]  There's people like Bobby that's been fighting the corporate establishment for 40 years as a lawyer that watched his father when he was 13 years old be killed for exactly this battle.
[02:48:28.450 --> 02:48:28.969]  And his uncle.
[02:48:29.350 --> 02:48:31.250]  And his uncle when he was 10 years old.
[02:48:31.409 --> 02:48:43.430]  So depending on what window you look at this, we're really at the end stage of a takeover and destruction of the one thing that stands in the way of globalist thinking, which is the Constitution of the United States of America.
[02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:45.719]  They're doing all these lawsuits trying to take my name.
[02:48:45.799 --> 02:48:46.540]  People say they can't do that.
[02:48:46.639 --> 02:48:47.540]  Well, I got to defend those.
[02:48:47.659 --> 02:48:48.319]  We're going to win.
[02:48:48.459 --> 02:48:48.920]  We're already winning.
[02:48:49.020 --> 02:48:50.100]  The judge shut them down last week.
[02:48:50.200 --> 02:48:54.079]  That took high-powered lawyers and that, you know, 50 grand right there to have those briefs ready, okay?
[02:48:54.180 --> 02:48:55.379]  This is total war.
[02:48:55.579 --> 02:48:56.399]  We make it easy.
[02:48:56.520 --> 02:48:58.600]  Great supplements, great t-shirts, great everything.

[02:49:11.569 --> 02:49:12.649]  My dad's a great supplement company.
[02:49:13.250 --> 02:49:14.049]  drjonesnationals.com.
[02:49:14.190 --> 02:49:15.809]  That's how we're funding this operation.
[02:49:16.010 --> 02:49:17.110]  Separate from InfoWars.
[02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.829]  You go there.
[02:49:17.850 --> 02:49:18.610]  You get t-shirts.

[02:49:19.770 --> 02:49:20.469]  You spread the word.
[02:49:20.569 --> 02:49:21.569]  You meet like-minded people.

[02:49:25.430 --> 02:49:26.129]  We need funds.
[02:49:26.209 --> 02:49:28.309]  And I'll go on the offense and just hope the money comes in.
[02:49:28.370 --> 02:49:29.350]  But we're going on the offense.
[02:49:29.450 --> 02:49:30.149]  We caught them.
[02:49:30.209 --> 02:49:30.909]  We got the documents.
[02:49:31.030 --> 02:49:33.250]  I told you I'll sue the CIA and FBI. Get ready.
[02:49:33.610 --> 02:49:35.549]  First steps start this week, and the enemy already knows.
[02:49:36.010 --> 02:49:38.350]  But I need money to do it.
[02:49:38.409 --> 02:49:40.389]  I don't even think about my life or any of that.
[02:49:40.450 --> 02:49:40.989]  That doesn't matter.
[02:49:41.049 --> 02:49:41.709]  I'm on this mission.
[02:49:41.729 --> 02:49:42.270]  I love it.
[02:49:42.309 --> 02:49:42.829]  This is great.
[02:49:43.110 --> 02:49:45.329]  But I need funds to fight a war.
[02:49:45.989 --> 02:49:46.809]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:49:47.629 --> 02:49:48.409]  DrJonesNationals.com.
[02:49:48.670 --> 02:49:50.569]  Those are the coordinates of the resistance.
[02:49:50.969 --> 02:49:58.790]  It's all there, and it's great products at great prices, highest quality, and it funds the fight against the New World Order that's coming down on us with both damn feet.
[02:49:58.930 --> 02:50:00.649]  But at least we're in the fight, and we're starting to win.
[02:50:08.190 --> 02:50:18.069]  A woman named Cassie in 2023 filed a lawsuit against Sean Diddy Combs detailing allegations of physical and sexual abuse during their relationship.
[02:50:18.430 --> 02:50:37.649]  This legal action was rapidly settled out of court, but led to 16 more individuals accusing Combs of various forms of abuse, which intensified when federal agents raided Combs' homes, leading to his arrest in September 2024 on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking.
[02:50:38.129 --> 02:50:52.850]  Combs has vehemently denied these allegations, of course, asserting his innocence and criticizing the accuser's motives, framing the accusations as attempts to tarnish his legacy and reputation for financial gain.
[02:50:53.049 --> 02:51:04.610]  But recently, Combs has been accused in a lawsuit by Ashley Parham of orchestrating a gang rape as retaliation for her, suggesting he was involved in the murder of Tupac Shakur.
[02:51:04.809 --> 02:51:07.649]  Ashley Parham says that P. Diddy showed up.
[02:51:08.059 --> 02:51:25.040]  With an entourage, including his top aide, Christina Coram, an unnamed woman who is not a defendant in the suit, and three unnamed men, one of whom she says was Diddy's driver, and Parham says that that driver waited outside throughout the whole of what I'm about to tell you.
[02:51:25.760 --> 02:51:36.360]  Defendant Diddy, while violently raping plaintiff with a television remote, told plaintiff that her life was in his hands, and that if he wanted, he could, quote, take her, and she would never be seen again.
[02:51:37.170 --> 02:51:51.889]  Defendant Diddy then instructed Defendant Shane to put a pillow over her head because he didn't want to see her face or hear her cries and instructed Defendant Shane to anally rape plaintiff.
[02:51:52.670 --> 02:51:59.950]  Defendant Shane did as he was told by defendant Diddy and began to anally rape plaintiff.
[02:52:00.110 --> 02:52:06.129]  Defendant Diddy then violently raped plaintiff anally after defendant Shane.
[02:52:06.610 --> 02:52:14.370]  Defendant Doe number two then joined defendants Diddy and Shane taking a turn anally raping plaintiff.
[02:52:14.670 --> 02:52:16.510]  Do not entertain.
[02:52:16.809 --> 02:52:20.350]  None of this nonsense and nothing over the phone.
[02:52:20.770 --> 02:52:25.090]  I'm gonna need you to get rid of all the leftover pizza boxes.
[02:52:25.350 --> 02:52:25.930]  The what?
[02:52:26.229 --> 02:52:29.010]  All the boxes left over for the pizza.
[02:52:29.670 --> 02:52:40.170]  Several people tied to Diddy mysteriously died of pneumonia at a young, healthy age, including Diddy's ex-girlfriend Kim Porter, Brittany Murphy, and her husband.
[02:52:40.450 --> 02:52:53.790]  It should be considered in the investigation that over a thousand bottles of baby oil were found in Diddy's home, and according to Poison Control, the ingestion of baby oil is usually minimally toxic.
[02:52:54.530 --> 02:53:00.370]  But can cause aspiration pneumonia when breathed into the lungs and when swallowed.
[02:53:00.670 --> 02:53:15.170]  If these allegations prove to be true, then Sean Diddy Combs is facing lifetimes in prison and has no other choice but to sing, potentially exposing celebrities, music icons, and high-level politicians.
[02:53:15.409 --> 02:53:19.690]  The Epstein-ing of Diddy is a foregone conclusion.
[02:53:28.060 --> 02:53:30.700]  I think you're doing so good.
[02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.760]  I just want to say, um...
[02:53:45.760 --> 02:53:55.620]  And now the allegations of children being raped by Sean Combs are seeing the light of day as the ties to the elite child sex trafficking rings begin to unravel.
[02:53:55.940 --> 02:53:56.920]  Comparing the two cases.
[02:53:57.059 --> 02:54:01.360]  So Epstein, you know, was accused of operating this sex trafficking network.
[02:54:01.520 --> 02:54:06.139]  Combs operating a criminal enterprise that engaged in sex trafficking and violent crime.
[02:54:06.239 --> 02:54:07.020]  So you see the similarities.
[02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:08.040]  There was another thing too.
[02:54:08.690 --> 02:54:20.770]  And I think it's an interesting component of these federal cases is that Epstein was being prosecuted for conduct from the early 2000s, Combs being prosecuted for conduct all the way back from 2008.
[02:54:21.110 --> 02:54:41.020]  The new complaints from a fusillade of lawsuits, a pool of more than 120 vetted clients describing a pattern of plaintiffs being drugged, Raped and threatened into silence by a representative of a segment of our civilization that considers themselves untouchable.
[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:44.100]  I'm a savage!
[02:54:45.579 --> 02:54:46.899]  I'm a savage!
[02:54:47.100 --> 02:54:48.340]  Whatever I want to get!
[02:54:48.760 --> 02:54:50.680]  Whatever I want, I have to get!
[02:54:50.940 --> 02:54:53.479]  John Bowne, reporting for InfoWars.
[02:54:55.260 --> 02:54:59.420]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars...
[02:54:59.620 --> 02:55:06.479]  Alright, very well known and respected, former Delta Force operator and famous contractor, Dale Comstock's our guest.
[02:55:06.799 --> 02:55:11.059]  DaleComstock.com, official American Badass on X. Best-selling book, American Badass.
[02:55:11.440 --> 02:55:15.840]  You were just telling me more about what they did to your wife and the targeting of you and the FBI and all the rest of it.
[02:55:15.879 --> 02:55:17.120]  You've got to tell the rest of the story.
[02:55:17.239 --> 02:55:20.979]  You're going to be on Owen today at 4 o'clock Central as we have continued election coverage.
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:23.020]  But let's get to this big story now.
[02:55:24.350 --> 02:55:28.770]  Because I've had an hour and a half to cogitate on this and really look at it.
[02:55:28.870 --> 02:55:30.430]  It's all over the local news in Michigan.
[02:55:31.610 --> 02:55:43.889]  Local Republican activist groups that have been on the ass of the Secretary of State is a total deep state Hillary Clinton Soros operative on record, just as bad as Governor Whitmer.
[02:55:45.329 --> 02:55:52.510]  They are reporting as more fake votes...
[02:55:54.719 --> 02:55:59.280]  Then real votes just in the numbers from yesterday.
[02:55:59.299 --> 02:56:11.680]  Now they're processing it today because of the voter registration database, which the Fed said two months ago the Russians are going to target and bring down so we don't know who's real and who's not.
[02:56:12.139 --> 02:56:12.559]  Uh-huh.
[02:56:13.100 --> 02:56:15.200]  And it's the Dominion machines...
[02:56:16.979 --> 02:56:18.440]  That are doing this.
[02:56:18.860 --> 02:56:22.620]  And of course it's coming out that it's skewed towards Kamala Walsh.
[02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:25.020]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:29.120]  And then 10 states have had federal judges rule illegal aliens can vote.
[02:56:29.780 --> 02:56:31.700]  The Secretary of State in Texas said fine.
[02:56:31.920 --> 02:56:33.399]  Illegal aliens can vote a month ago.
[02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:36.120]  People hear this, they go, is that true?
[02:56:36.180 --> 02:56:37.180]  You pull the articles up.
[02:56:37.579 --> 02:56:37.979]  Newscast.
[02:56:38.219 --> 02:56:40.659]  You cannot make this up.
[02:56:40.799 --> 02:56:42.180]  So the bad news is it's happening.
[02:56:42.280 --> 02:56:42.860]  The steel is on.
[02:56:42.940 --> 02:56:43.780]  We don't know they'll be successful.
[02:56:43.799 --> 02:56:45.239]  It'll be enough to override the landslide.
[02:56:47.719 --> 02:56:52.379]  But the good news is people are seeing this out in the open.
[02:56:52.520 --> 02:56:59.680]  So now this snake woman, we've played a bunch of the last month, has been all over the national news show saying it's insane.
[02:56:59.819 --> 02:57:01.079]  There's never any problems.
[02:57:01.260 --> 02:57:01.739]  Don't question.
[02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:03.579]  Sure, there's 500,000 non-voters on there.
[02:57:03.700 --> 02:57:04.420]  Don't worry about it.
[02:57:05.700 --> 02:57:07.719]  Total in-your-face gaslighting.
[02:57:08.479 --> 02:57:14.639]  And now the local news is just spinning it like, okay, yeah, there's more fake votes than real votes.
[02:57:14.819 --> 02:57:16.200]  Just live with it.
[02:57:17.139 --> 02:57:24.000]  Here is Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson on NBC News.
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:24.440]  Here it is.
[02:57:36.260 --> 02:57:42.079]  Yeah, this is a nationwide issue with Dominion Voter Access Terminals in the counties that use them.
[02:57:42.260 --> 02:57:53.680]  The Voter Access Terminals, of course, not all the machines, just the ones that are accessible, have an issue with the straight party voting and a programming issue that's, again, affected the machines nationwide.
[02:57:53.680 --> 02:58:22.149]  And I think all of us that use Dominion machines were unhappy to learn about this during the testing period and as early voting So we're working with Dominion to seek accountability on that front and also are working with our clerks to ensure voters are aware of this programming issue that will require them to ensure they are voting every section on the ballot.
[02:58:22.329 --> 02:58:27.989]  Do you think it's a bigger issue in Michigan because we do allow voters to cross over in ways that a lot of other states don't?
[02:58:28.250 --> 02:58:29.209]  Because we have straight parties.
[02:58:30.969 --> 02:58:34.489]  It's not struck me as I've talked to my other colleagues in other states.
[02:58:34.489 --> 02:58:36.190]  They're just as upset about it as we are.
[02:58:37.030 --> 02:58:37.590]  So, yeah.
[02:58:37.950 --> 02:58:38.649]  Or surprised.
[02:58:39.149 --> 02:58:42.809]  Guys, do this because when the show's over, I'm going to immediately shoot an emergency report on this.
[02:58:43.900 --> 02:58:52.979]  But we have MTG saying almost two weeks ago on air that she's getting reports from her constituents of it flipping straight ballot from Republican to Democrat.
[02:58:53.200 --> 02:58:54.420]  Then it got confirmed all over the country.
[02:58:54.579 --> 02:58:58.159]  And now here's the Secretary of State saying, but she doesn't tell you the details.
[02:58:58.159 --> 02:58:59.459]  We just showed it to you.
[02:58:59.559 --> 02:59:03.340]  I'll go back over it while Dale's responding to this.
[02:59:03.479 --> 02:59:07.819]  But more fake votes from addresses that aren't even right.
[02:59:08.899 --> 02:59:12.559]  With people that didn't even vote, it's just magically putting votes in.
[02:59:14.120 --> 02:59:19.239]  And what did MTG say last week and a half ago on this show?
[02:59:19.600 --> 02:59:21.299]  That was October 18th.
[02:59:21.700 --> 02:59:25.659]  They went completely apeshit when she said that on my show.
[02:59:25.819 --> 02:59:26.739]  I got threatened.
[02:59:26.819 --> 02:59:27.440]  She got threatened.
[02:59:27.500 --> 02:59:28.979]  And now, Dale Comstock, here we are.
[02:59:29.159 --> 02:59:31.120]  What would you call this fiasco?
[02:59:31.899 --> 02:59:34.280]  It is, because why are we still using these machines?
[02:59:34.479 --> 02:59:38.260]  Okay, they were questionable last time, and here we are using the machines again.
[02:59:38.600 --> 02:59:45.979]  You'd think they would have thoroughly checked these machines, made sure they worked accurate, and why are we waiting until the final hour and go, oh, wow, looks like we have a problem.
[02:59:46.319 --> 02:59:50.079]  And now we're in the last week of voting.
[02:59:50.879 --> 02:59:54.260]  How do we know that the votes, everybody's votes actually gonna count?
[02:59:54.459 --> 03:00:02.020]  And how do we know that, you know, the election's not gonna go the wrong way because we've got a bunch of fake votes, dead people voting again?
[03:00:02.819 --> 03:00:04.579]  There's no fairness to this thing.
[03:00:04.739 --> 03:00:14.979]  And maybe, maybe you were talking about, maybe there's gonna be a moment where, you know, Perhaps what they're going to do is, hey, machines are broken.
[03:00:15.139 --> 03:00:18.100]  We're going to have to stop the election process and do a redo.
[03:00:18.280 --> 03:00:19.780]  Who knows why they're doing this.
[03:00:19.940 --> 03:00:20.760]  Oh, they've promised.
[03:00:21.020 --> 03:00:22.120]  There's going to be problems.
[03:00:22.120 --> 03:00:22.940]  It's going to take weeks.
[03:00:23.079 --> 03:00:24.399]  Yeah, so there it is, right?
[03:00:24.440 --> 03:00:26.620]  So maybe this is actually part of the play.
[03:00:27.159 --> 03:00:28.819]  I don't know why we're doing this.
[03:00:28.920 --> 03:00:30.319]  Why don't we just go back to the old way.
[03:00:30.459 --> 03:00:31.440]  Everybody walk in.
[03:00:31.860 --> 03:00:32.879]  Show your ID card.
[03:00:33.459 --> 03:00:34.260]  Submit a ballot.
[03:00:34.540 --> 03:00:36.559]  Have it validated by both parties.
[03:00:36.979 --> 03:00:38.799]  And let's do it the old-fashioned way.
[03:00:39.020 --> 03:00:42.520]  California has a law where you can't show ID. Yeah, exactly, right?
[03:00:42.700 --> 03:00:43.840]  So all on purpose.
[03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:49.079]  And again, in all these states until about 2018, after Trump won, they went, ooh, and now everywhere.
[03:00:49.100 --> 03:00:50.500]  Now it takes weeks to get it done.
[03:00:51.280 --> 03:00:56.120]  Well, I thought nobody can get an ID. What was that whole story about, remember?
[03:00:56.819 --> 03:00:58.040]  Some people can't get ID cards.
[03:00:58.079 --> 03:00:58.719]  Are you kidding me?
[03:00:59.239 --> 03:01:00.399]  Why do we keep lying?
[03:01:00.559 --> 03:01:02.600]  Why do they keep lying to the American people?
[03:01:02.780 --> 03:01:05.520]  I have yet to meet one American who says, I can't get an ID card.
[03:01:05.620 --> 03:01:06.260]  Are you kidding me?
[03:01:06.780 --> 03:01:07.739]  Lies, lies, lies.
[03:01:07.899 --> 03:01:11.940]  And I don't know how people Can believe these lies and just go along with it.
[03:01:12.239 --> 03:01:16.920]  It's like, again, it goes back to what we talked about earlier, the mass hypnosis, psychosis, propaganda.
[03:01:17.260 --> 03:01:21.200]  They're winning the information war because they understand the human condition.
[03:01:21.420 --> 03:01:23.040]  They actually understand it better than human beings.
[03:01:23.630 --> 03:01:40.049]  But, exactly, but I found, while I named the show Infowars, it was just the Alex Jones show until 1997, and I went and said, this is like an information war, and one of my buddies that I would co-host with was a deputy fire chief at former Air Force Intelligence,
[03:01:40.209 --> 03:01:41.750]  he said, this is an information war.
[03:01:41.969 --> 03:01:50.590]  We tried to go by the name Infowars, it wasn't available, but Infowars was, and of course I didn't invent that term, it's hundreds of years old, but Mind war, that's where we are.
[03:01:50.729 --> 03:01:51.190]  And here's an example.
[03:01:51.329 --> 03:01:52.430]  I've heard of James Blair before.
[03:01:52.549 --> 03:01:54.489]  This guy's been all over their ass.
[03:01:54.950 --> 03:01:56.629]  We're going to get him on in Michigan.
[03:01:57.170 --> 03:02:03.170]  Political director of the Trump 2024 campaign and Republican National Committee in Michigan.
[03:02:03.629 --> 03:02:09.430]  And he's the one going in and getting into the documents, getting into the databases to expose this.
[03:02:09.709 --> 03:02:13.270]  She wasn't going to tell us this was going on, and she wasn't going to tell us there's a nationwide thing.
[03:02:13.370 --> 03:02:19.670]  But as soon as they got caught, because, I mean, you know, you're talking about But this is giant.
[03:02:19.850 --> 03:02:21.450]  This is more fraudulent votes than real.
[03:02:21.930 --> 03:02:24.250]  And she goes, oh, it's everywhere, so it's okay.
[03:02:24.729 --> 03:02:26.590]  I mean, this is incredible.
[03:02:26.950 --> 03:02:30.309]  And so let me show people this, and there's more stuff coming in.
[03:02:30.750 --> 03:02:32.350]  New Michigan Secretary of State.
[03:02:32.510 --> 03:02:33.809]  This is new breaking information.
[03:02:34.690 --> 03:02:42.270]  Jacqueline Benson says there is a nationwide issue with Dominion Voting accessing terminals preventing voters from making certain selections, flipping them.
[03:02:42.370 --> 03:02:43.329]  Of course there is.
[03:02:43.409 --> 03:02:45.530]  And then it goes on, and they look at it.
[03:02:45.909 --> 03:02:53.469]  After reviewing the qualified voter file, And it just goes on here in Michigan.
[03:02:54.049 --> 03:03:03.690]  Yesterday, the database identifies 114,545 Michigan voters who have cast 279,113 ballots for multiple addresses across the state.
[03:03:03.850 --> 03:03:09.030]  The results in 164,568 excess ballots as of last night.
[03:03:09.149 --> 03:03:10.709]  Below is the...
[03:03:10.709 --> 03:03:12.030]  I mean, this is just wild.
[03:03:12.290 --> 03:03:14.030]  I mean, what do you call that?
[03:03:15.489 --> 03:03:15.889]  Criminal.
[03:03:17.430 --> 03:03:19.569]  They're committing crimes right in front of everyone.
[03:03:20.270 --> 03:03:22.790]  I mean, that's just outright criminal.
[03:03:23.229 --> 03:03:24.389]  There's no excuse for it.
[03:03:24.590 --> 03:03:29.930]  And then they bust up in Pennsylvania, clearly, illegal aliens, and they bring them to the head of the line.
[03:03:30.290 --> 03:03:30.590]  Exactly.
[03:03:31.290 --> 03:03:32.969]  Looks like, to me, they're trying to piss us off.
[03:03:33.409 --> 03:03:36.229]  Well, you know, we've seen this coming for years.
[03:03:36.350 --> 03:03:37.010]  Most people have.
[03:03:37.790 --> 03:03:38.670]  This is a plan.
[03:03:38.770 --> 03:03:40.110]  This is not a conspiracy.
[03:03:40.129 --> 03:03:41.170]  It's not an accident.
[03:03:41.409 --> 03:03:42.729]  This is all deliberately done.
[03:03:42.950 --> 03:03:45.090]  The question is, what are we gonna do about it?
[03:03:45.190 --> 03:03:49.530]  And what are we gonna do about it when, if Trump loses the election because they stole it?
[03:03:49.610 --> 03:03:53.309]  He won't lose it because he didn't win it fair and square.
[03:03:53.829 --> 03:03:54.709]  He's gonna lose it.
[03:03:54.770 --> 03:03:56.409]  If he loses it, it's because they stole it.
[03:03:56.510 --> 03:03:58.909]  And the question's gonna be, what are we gonna do next?
[03:03:58.930 --> 03:03:59.670]  Because it's coming.
[03:03:59.950 --> 03:04:00.809]  It's gonna happen.
[03:04:00.850 --> 03:04:05.530]  And if he does win, they're gonna tie him up to the point where he's basically being castrated.
[03:04:05.690 --> 03:04:06.850]  He's gonna be completely ineffective.
[03:04:06.989 --> 03:04:08.790]  They're gonna tie up all kinds of crap again.
[03:04:08.989 --> 03:04:12.750]  Who knows, maybe another Russian collusion case, maybe another lost laptop.
[03:04:13.250 --> 03:04:14.590]  They're gonna make stuff up.
[03:04:14.760 --> 03:04:17.780]  And what they're doing is not fair to the American citizenry.
[03:04:17.920 --> 03:04:19.000]  We don't deserve this.
[03:04:19.100 --> 03:04:19.879]  We deserve the truth.
[03:04:20.040 --> 03:04:21.620]  We deserve an honest and fair election.
[03:04:21.860 --> 03:04:25.959]  And again, I'm gonna make this call out to the Americans, particularly American men.
[03:04:26.340 --> 03:04:26.979]  You know what?
[03:04:27.180 --> 03:04:31.120]  Stand up, be recognized, and stop rolling over to these people.
[03:04:31.299 --> 03:04:32.819]  They're gonna take your freedom.
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.180]  They're gonna take your freedom from you, your family.
[03:04:36.709 --> 03:04:39.229]  And your life and your children's lives are gonna be hell here on.
[03:04:39.389 --> 03:04:40.209]  And guess what?
[03:04:40.329 --> 03:04:44.389]  The old adage, you can vote your way into socialism, but you're gonna have to shoot your way out.
[03:04:44.510 --> 03:04:46.010]  And that's exactly where we're at.
[03:04:46.129 --> 03:04:47.309]  We're that close right now.
[03:04:48.799 --> 03:04:54.700]  And the Democrats are saying they're gonna go to, did you see Carmel say Trump's coming for black men with no evidence we need to have an armed uprising?
[03:04:55.079 --> 03:04:57.459]  Yeah, so that's what they're calling for.
[03:04:57.899 --> 03:05:03.219]  If that's what they're calling for, if there is an armed uprising, what they want to do is start a civil war.
[03:05:03.260 --> 03:05:06.139]  But I got bad news, that civil war is gonna roll into a revolution.
[03:05:06.479 --> 03:05:09.600]  And guess who we're gonna come for as the citizens?
[03:05:10.040 --> 03:05:14.440]  Okay, we're gonna realize as civilians that, you know what, we're really not fighting each other.
[03:05:14.600 --> 03:05:16.139]  We don't have a beef with each other.
[03:05:16.319 --> 03:05:17.159]  It's all a lie.
[03:05:17.479 --> 03:05:19.579]  Guess who's gonna be next on the list, on the menu?
[03:05:19.760 --> 03:05:26.020]  It's gonna be everybody that has promoted this, who's propagandized this.
[03:05:26.200 --> 03:05:27.780]  They're the ones that are gonna be on the list.
[03:05:28.059 --> 03:05:32.979]  And again, the- The repercussion should be severe.
[03:05:33.520 --> 03:05:35.979]  We just can't give them a pass, slap on the wrist.
[03:05:36.100 --> 03:05:37.340]  Okay, Hillary, don't do that again.
[03:05:37.579 --> 03:05:39.200]  There's got to be severe consequences.
[03:05:39.479 --> 03:05:40.700]  People need to wake up.
[03:05:40.819 --> 03:05:41.559]  This is real.
[03:05:41.739 --> 03:05:43.840]  This is not going to pass.
[03:05:44.100 --> 03:05:45.540]  And okay, next election, we'll get them.
[03:05:45.639 --> 03:05:47.360]  No, it's not going to happen next election.
[03:05:48.440 --> 03:05:52.879]  There's a reason they brought in, what is it, 15, 20 million criminals across the world?
[03:05:52.879 --> 03:05:53.479]  25 million.
[03:05:53.700 --> 03:05:55.059]  Yeah, here we are, 25 million.
[03:05:55.180 --> 03:05:56.860]  These are all new Democratic voters.
[03:05:57.020 --> 03:06:01.639]  They're going to keep giving them free stuff and luring them in to vote for the left.
[03:06:01.860 --> 03:06:05.139]  And by the way, we're not a democracy, as you know that.
[03:06:06.379 --> 03:06:07.819]  We're a constitutional republic.
[03:06:08.540 --> 03:06:15.139]  We are not going to have the ability to vote for the country that we want because basically we're going to be a one-party system.
[03:06:15.299 --> 03:06:18.180]  A Democrat, liberal, communist party is what it's going to turn into.
[03:06:18.790 --> 03:06:20.229]  And I want to be clear, you're absolutely right.
[03:06:20.229 --> 03:06:28.790]  If Trump doesn't legally and lawfully go scorched earth, remove all the U.S. attorneys, all the cop justice department people, and go on the offense, they will tie him up and do the same thing again.
[03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:29.930]  He knows that this time.
[03:06:30.170 --> 03:06:31.590]  That's why the deep state's so scared.
[03:06:31.709 --> 03:06:44.600]  And that's why if he does override the fraud, if we do, it's in the 76 days when he's president-elect That they've got legislation in there to pass to strip him of military power, which is a legislative coup against the executive.
[03:06:44.860 --> 03:06:47.040]  Total government revolution against us.
[03:06:47.799 --> 03:06:50.500]  They are gearing up for civil unrest that they're going to start.
[03:06:50.620 --> 03:06:53.280]  They're going to try to brand it as a racial civil war.
[03:06:53.559 --> 03:06:56.959]  They'll provide the false flags instead of a revolution against the tyrants.
[03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:58.299]  But I agree with you, Dale.
[03:06:58.459 --> 03:06:59.760]  There's so much understanding now.
[03:06:59.920 --> 03:07:01.459]  Exponentially, the dog's not going to hunt.
[03:07:01.870 --> 03:07:04.969]  No, and I don't think the plan's gonna work.
[03:07:06.750 --> 03:07:12.350]  I cannot see them basically locking everybody down again.
[03:07:13.299 --> 03:07:14.780]  I don't see martial law in effect.
[03:07:14.959 --> 03:07:15.819]  Who's going to enforce that?
[03:07:15.979 --> 03:07:16.940]  Who's going to enforce that?
[03:07:17.079 --> 03:07:18.180]  Because the police are really awake.
[03:07:18.559 --> 03:07:20.700]  Yeah, the police are not on their side.
[03:07:20.819 --> 03:07:21.299]  They're on our side.
[03:07:21.420 --> 03:07:26.840]  And most of the military, again, those that matter, the combat arms and shooters, they're not going to fall for that either.
[03:07:26.879 --> 03:07:27.940]  And they're not going to fight us.
[03:07:28.020 --> 03:07:28.500]  They're not.
[03:07:28.659 --> 03:07:30.280]  So they really don't have any leverage.
[03:07:30.319 --> 03:07:31.280]  All they have is threats.
[03:07:31.399 --> 03:07:33.059]  And we're not trying to be threatening here.
[03:07:33.180 --> 03:07:34.200]  I don't know how history works.
[03:07:34.260 --> 03:07:35.440]  I'm not like you that's actually done it all.
[03:07:35.500 --> 03:07:38.360]  But I'm a big history buff and had a lot of family that did some of the stuff you've done.
[03:07:39.659 --> 03:07:46.059]  When this all goes down, all these globalists, all these minions, their own security people aren't looking for this.
[03:07:46.200 --> 03:07:50.459]  But if we go to a real revolution, people are going to fall down and break their necks.
[03:07:50.559 --> 03:07:52.399]  It's going to be real quiet.
[03:07:53.139 --> 03:07:57.059]  You're not going to hear about it, but it's just going to be a lot of dead people in the establishment.
[03:07:57.079 --> 03:07:59.020]  I mean, am I right?
[03:07:59.180 --> 03:07:59.940]  Yeah, I agree.
[03:08:00.159 --> 03:08:03.579]  And I think it's not just going to be, like I said earlier, it's going to be a domino effect.
[03:08:03.760 --> 03:08:07.579]  The rest of the world is going to collapse right underneath the United States, you know, and there's a lot of people.
[03:08:07.680 --> 03:08:08.200]  That's the big one.
[03:08:08.280 --> 03:08:08.780]  It leads to war.
[03:08:08.969 --> 03:08:10.170]  Yeah, and it's gonna be a global war.
[03:08:10.309 --> 03:08:17.489]  And I actually believe that most people will rise up against the tyrants.
[03:08:17.489 --> 03:08:19.469]  They know who they are in their own countries.
[03:08:19.709 --> 03:08:22.190]  And maybe that's gonna be the real reset.
[03:08:22.629 --> 03:08:25.829]  I mean, do the globalists know that almost universally...
[03:08:26.600 --> 03:08:30.540]  Their own security across the board knows they're the bad guys and are just sitting there waiting?
[03:08:30.760 --> 03:08:31.819]  I mean, are they that dumb?
[03:08:32.139 --> 03:08:35.719]  They're just collecting a paycheck and going along nodding their head, yes sir, yes sir, I'll protect you.
[03:08:35.799 --> 03:08:37.940]  But I can see that backfiring too.
[03:08:38.120 --> 03:08:41.500]  I've worked on plenty of security details where I've had to cover down on guys I didn't like.
[03:08:41.719 --> 03:08:46.040]  And I had to ask myself, am I really going to protect this guy when the crap hits the fan?
[03:08:46.280 --> 03:08:48.299]  Doubt it, but I'll take the paycheck in the meantime.
[03:08:48.500 --> 03:08:49.620]  Sounds a little disloyal.
[03:08:50.280 --> 03:08:51.040]  It's not that.
[03:08:51.159 --> 03:08:53.860]  When these are globalist traders and people are watching them for years...
[03:08:54.579 --> 03:08:55.299]  It's a response.
[03:08:55.520 --> 03:08:56.979]  I mean, look, I'm just stating a fact here.
[03:08:57.479 --> 03:09:04.959]  And, I mean, look, we need to see more like Zuckerberg rolling over, apologizing, promising not to do it anymore.
[03:09:04.979 --> 03:09:05.940]  Because we're not looking for trouble.
[03:09:06.059 --> 03:09:06.899]  We want to just stop.
[03:09:07.059 --> 03:09:07.239]  Yeah.
[03:09:08.090 --> 03:09:09.809]  You wanna offer the globalists to give up?
[03:09:09.989 --> 03:09:10.629]  You wanna talk to them?
[03:09:11.129 --> 03:09:14.209]  Yeah, you should give up because this is not gonna work out for you.
[03:09:14.690 --> 03:09:17.389]  There's no way you can oppress 8 billion people.
[03:09:17.770 --> 03:09:19.329]  We're not gonna let that happen.
[03:09:19.629 --> 03:09:25.850]  And you might try, but you won't have an army to do it with because the army is actually made of the people.
[03:09:26.090 --> 03:09:27.370]  They're made of our sons.
[03:09:27.389 --> 03:09:29.110]  They're made of our fathers, okay?
[03:09:29.370 --> 03:09:34.389]  And so I doubt seriously you're gonna see your own military turn on its civilians.
[03:09:34.549 --> 03:09:35.809]  And they might, sometimes they do.
[03:09:36.190 --> 03:09:37.770]  But they're severely outnumbered.
[03:09:56.329 --> 03:09:57.909]  Well, you know, I'm glad you said the virus thing.
[03:09:57.989 --> 03:09:59.270]  I'm surprised the virus hasn't come out.
[03:09:59.329 --> 03:10:00.389]  But they know it's not gonna work again.
[03:10:00.690 --> 03:10:02.370]  It worked last time, and that was intentional.
[03:10:03.290 --> 03:10:03.950]  And here we are.
[03:10:04.010 --> 03:10:05.069]  I was actually surprised this morning.
[03:10:05.209 --> 03:10:08.270]  I'm looking at the local news, and they're offering COVID shots along with the flu shot.
[03:10:08.290 --> 03:10:08.909]  Get two for one.
[03:10:09.129 --> 03:10:10.370]  I'm like, are we still doing this?
[03:10:10.469 --> 03:10:11.750]  Are we still doing this COVID thing?
[03:10:11.889 --> 03:10:13.149]  There's a very small uptake, though.
[03:10:13.609 --> 03:10:15.209]  Yeah, but who's dying from it, right?
[03:10:15.350 --> 03:10:17.530]  99.9978% survival rate.
[03:10:18.270 --> 03:10:21.290]  But they've used this to scare people.
[03:10:21.530 --> 03:10:24.290]  It was an experiment to see if people would comply.
[03:10:24.510 --> 03:10:26.469]  80% of the population did comply.
[03:10:26.569 --> 03:10:31.729]  They took their shots, stayed at home, gave up their jobs, and they were good little civilians.
[03:10:32.709 --> 03:10:33.950]  We can't do that anymore.
[03:10:34.069 --> 03:10:39.409]  And it's like my earlier, what I said earlier to the men out there is, your job is to provide and protect.
[03:10:39.979 --> 03:10:40.899]  And act like a man.
[03:10:41.040 --> 03:10:41.520]  Be a warrior.
[03:10:41.659 --> 03:10:43.399]  You don't have to be a soldier, but be prepared to be a warrior.
[03:10:43.620 --> 03:10:44.420]  Defend your family.
[03:10:44.559 --> 03:10:45.879]  Defend our way of life.
[03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:46.540]  Defend freedom.
[03:10:46.680 --> 03:10:47.500]  Defend what's right.
[03:10:47.799 --> 03:10:48.479]  And stop.
[03:10:48.899 --> 03:10:51.659]  I love the, I'm paraphrasing Elon Musk.
[03:10:51.760 --> 03:10:53.280]  He said something the other day that was pretty interesting.
[03:10:53.659 --> 03:11:02.739]  He said, war is when young men that don't know each other go to war to kill each other, yet the guys that sent them are two old men that do know each other.
[03:11:02.840 --> 03:11:03.659]  And here we are.
[03:11:04.780 --> 03:11:05.799]  We gotta learn.
[03:11:06.840 --> 03:11:08.260]  Who the puppeteers are.
[03:11:09.100 --> 03:11:14.520]  I've been in every conflict since 1983 from Grenada to the present conflict, every one of them with the exception of Serbia.
[03:11:15.139 --> 03:11:18.700]  And recently, I started looking back.
[03:11:18.700 --> 03:11:21.540]  I look back at Mogadishu, what happened there with Clinton.
[03:11:21.680 --> 03:11:23.819]  I look at Kabul, the fall of Kabul.
[03:11:25.529 --> 03:11:28.149]  It's saddened because now I look at it, and I have a lot of regrets.
[03:11:28.430 --> 03:11:31.069]  On one hand, I enjoyed my service in the military.
[03:11:31.229 --> 03:11:31.649]  I learned a lot.
[03:11:31.649 --> 03:11:32.590]  I did a lot of good things.
[03:11:32.649 --> 03:11:33.110]  I helped people.
[03:11:33.209 --> 03:11:33.969]  I saved people's lives.
[03:11:34.510 --> 03:11:35.850]  I put away bad people.
[03:11:36.069 --> 03:11:44.610]  Then on the other hand, I realized we're also just pawned in this big freaking machine, and we're being used, and good men and women are dying.
[03:11:44.729 --> 03:11:49.350]  You're fighting an enemy that is legitimately bad, but our own government's funding them behind the scenes.
[03:11:49.559 --> 03:11:53.639]  Well, and in some respect, our enemy, yeah, is not only fun of them, but they actually are the enemy.
[03:11:53.940 --> 03:12:06.920]  I mean, at the end of the day, you know, when you send, you leave 80-something billion dollars worth of equipment behind for the Taliban to have, and you get 13 more Americans killed in a really crappy withdrawal, you know, are you really looking out for American interests?
[03:12:07.260 --> 03:12:08.159]  And Benghazi?
[03:12:08.360 --> 03:12:09.000]  And Benghazi.
[03:12:09.100 --> 03:12:10.340]  We can go on and on and on, right?
[03:12:10.500 --> 03:12:20.149]  So, and I was telling a guy earlier, before we came on the show, I said, you know, I was the guy that used to always encourage men and women to join the military.
[03:12:20.370 --> 03:12:21.670]  I said, it's the best college in town.
[03:12:21.809 --> 03:12:22.670]  You go to get an education.
[03:12:22.889 --> 03:12:24.909]  You learn life experiences and things like that.
[03:12:25.069 --> 03:12:26.930]  They're going to be very valuable in life.
[03:12:27.010 --> 03:12:29.750]  And now I get guys that call me and go, sir, I'm thinking about joining the military.
[03:12:29.829 --> 03:12:31.110]  I'd like to go to special operations.
[03:12:31.110 --> 03:12:32.069]  Do you have any advice?
[03:12:32.250 --> 03:12:34.329]  And my advice is don't join.
[03:12:34.670 --> 03:12:35.729]  Why would you join?
[03:12:35.889 --> 03:12:39.149]  Do you want to fight for this regime?
[03:12:39.649 --> 03:12:41.649]  Because America's been captured and hijacked.
[03:12:41.709 --> 03:12:42.370]  We have to get it back.
[03:12:42.700 --> 03:12:43.020]  Exactly.
[03:12:43.319 --> 03:12:44.000]  So, you know what?
[03:12:44.059 --> 03:12:44.840]  I said, you know what?
[03:12:44.940 --> 03:12:45.559]  This regime?
[03:12:45.840 --> 03:12:46.159]  No.
[03:12:46.360 --> 03:12:54.920]  I said, you know, I would love to, you know, have Siege join the military because it's good for you, but, you know, at the end of the day, they're just recruiting you as cannon fodder.
[03:12:55.020 --> 03:12:56.500]  And then they want to destroy you later.
[03:12:56.680 --> 03:13:01.459]  And let's close with this, because you were telling me more about, there's a microcosm, about corrupt, not just the top, even the bottom.
[03:13:02.329 --> 03:13:04.610]  Now, they put me on a list of harass when I come back in the country.
[03:13:05.149 --> 03:13:07.809]  Almost every time they go, hey, you need to check your FOIA requests.
[03:13:08.010 --> 03:13:08.829]  It's really bad stuff.
[03:13:08.870 --> 03:13:09.469]  We know it's bull.
[03:13:09.629 --> 03:13:10.250]  We're not going to do it.
[03:13:10.290 --> 03:13:10.729]  You can go.
[03:13:11.049 --> 03:13:16.049]  So that's been my experience with customs, you know, here in Austin and other areas because they know who I am.
[03:13:16.110 --> 03:13:19.829]  They know they're like, God, we can't tell you what this is, but, you know, it's obviously, you know, bad guy stuff.
[03:13:20.329 --> 03:13:26.350]  Totally mad at me just harass me, pull me out for hours, put me back there, but they always release me quickly and say, this is BS. Then we've done four years.
[03:13:26.450 --> 03:13:27.129]  They won't respond back.
[03:13:27.290 --> 03:13:30.049]  But what they did to your wife, it's even worse than I knew.
[03:13:30.489 --> 03:13:33.530]  Describe that story or tell me during the break before you leave and do Owen's show.
[03:13:33.750 --> 03:13:34.430]  Yeah, so real quick.
[03:13:34.530 --> 03:13:36.049]  My wife and I were married in the United States.
[03:13:36.170 --> 03:13:36.850]  We're in and out of the country.
[03:13:36.909 --> 03:13:37.850]  We have a home in Florida.
[03:13:38.129 --> 03:13:39.610]  She had a military ID card.
[03:13:39.829 --> 03:13:42.030]  We had applied for a green card over three years ago.
[03:13:42.790 --> 03:13:48.290]  We came back during COVID. We could not get back to Indonesia because the COVID travel restrictions back in Indonesia wouldn't allow us to.
[03:13:48.489 --> 03:13:51.129]  So we had to extend month by month by month.
[03:13:52.129 --> 03:13:57.239]  About six months into it, seven months into it, My wife was hit by an undercover police car.
[03:13:57.420 --> 03:14:01.479]  He was traveling at 90 miles an hour in Panama City Beach in a high-speed pursuit, which was illegal at the time.
[03:14:01.579 --> 03:14:04.639]  She was in a parked car as a passenger, hospitalized everybody.
[03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:07.719]  She had neck and spinal injuries.
[03:14:07.819 --> 03:14:09.959]  And then during her treatment, they discovered she had cancer.
[03:14:10.459 --> 03:14:12.299]  So now she had to go through cancer treatment.
[03:14:12.500 --> 03:14:14.959]  So the COVID restrictions didn't get lifted.
[03:14:15.819 --> 03:14:19.200]  Until January 12th of 2022, we arrived in March of 2021.
[03:14:19.559 --> 03:14:24.920]  So technically, we were an overstay on a five-year unlimited visa, which didn't make any sense to me.
[03:14:25.399 --> 03:14:26.959]  So anyways, we didn't know.
[03:14:27.340 --> 03:14:32.700]  But once she was cleared for the treatment, we went back to Indonesia on our own recognizance, came back six weeks later.
[03:14:34.120 --> 03:14:40.219]  We were both detained in LAX by CBP. They separated us, would not allow us to communicate, talk to each other, phone calls.
[03:14:40.770 --> 03:14:43.569]  The first question I asked my wife, is your husband Dale Comstock?
[03:14:43.729 --> 03:14:44.610]  And she's like, yeah.
[03:14:45.030 --> 03:14:48.049]  And I got on the phone, it's him, and then the circus started, right?
[03:14:48.229 --> 03:14:51.190]  So they took her downstairs, they told me to wait in baggage claim.
[03:14:51.870 --> 03:14:55.290]  They said it takes about two hours, they're gonna do an interview and everything will be fine.
[03:14:55.290 --> 03:14:58.370]  So I waited in baggage claim for 24 hours, literally sat on my suitcase.
[03:14:58.850 --> 03:15:03.350]  No food, no water, just sitting waiting for my puppy to show up, and nothing happened.
[03:15:03.549 --> 03:15:06.309]  I had nobody to call, I had no one to contact.
[03:15:06.450 --> 03:15:08.110]  They said, just wait outside and we'll get to you.
[03:15:08.909 --> 03:15:13.889]  Later on, I find out that they did an interview about 3 o'clock in the morning.
[03:15:13.969 --> 03:15:19.049]  So we arrived at noon, 3 o'clock the next morning, they did an interview, and they said, okay, we'll ask you some questions.
[03:15:19.329 --> 03:15:20.049]  Just answers yes.
[03:15:20.209 --> 03:15:21.229]  She goes, well, what if the answer is no?
[03:15:21.309 --> 03:15:22.850]  She goes, I just answered yes, so we'll get you out of here.
[03:15:22.889 --> 03:15:24.270]  She's like, she didn't understand what that meant.
[03:15:24.510 --> 03:15:25.389]  So she said no.
[03:15:25.510 --> 03:15:28.649]  They asked her, did you know you were an overstay, an awful overstay?
[03:15:28.690 --> 03:15:29.250]  She said no.
[03:15:29.739 --> 03:15:32.500]  Anyways, they changed about four to six of her answers to yes.
[03:15:32.620 --> 03:15:33.920]  I actually have the documents.
[03:15:34.819 --> 03:15:36.899]  And so she was not aware of that.
[03:15:37.079 --> 03:15:38.280]  They put in a sealed package.
[03:15:38.540 --> 03:15:40.440]  And then they actually used somebody else's passport.
[03:15:40.920 --> 03:15:42.319]  And they go, yes, you weren't overstating.
[03:15:42.379 --> 03:15:44.219]  You knew it because here's your passport and here's the stamp.
[03:15:44.360 --> 03:15:45.440]  Well, that wasn't actually her passport.
[03:15:45.579 --> 03:15:46.200]  She goes, let me see that.
[03:15:46.280 --> 03:15:47.299]  And they wouldn't let her see it.
[03:15:47.459 --> 03:15:51.350]  Well, later on, There's some other stuff that happened, basically.
[03:15:52.510 --> 03:15:55.950]  Next thing I know, I get a text message tomorrow from United Airlines that says, time to board.
[03:15:56.049 --> 03:15:57.649]  And I'm like, what does that mean, time to board?
[03:15:57.729 --> 03:16:02.229]  And then I realize they're putting my wife on a flight back to Jakarta.
[03:16:02.409 --> 03:16:05.489]  And now my wife had no money, no credit cards, no clothes, no phone charge.
[03:16:05.569 --> 03:16:09.190]  She had nothing with it, because we literally got off the airplane when they rolled her up.
[03:16:10.389 --> 03:16:14.469]  So they marched her down the terminal, two armed police officers.
[03:16:14.590 --> 03:16:16.430]  My wife is five feet tall, 88 pounds.
[03:16:16.850 --> 03:16:18.690]  And they got her left and right arms.
[03:16:19.899 --> 03:16:21.739]  March on the aircraft when everybody's on board.
[03:16:21.799 --> 03:16:23.860]  They walk from front to rear, they handcuff her.
[03:16:24.399 --> 03:16:27.239]  I'm trying to call her at this point because I realize what's going on.
[03:16:27.440 --> 03:16:28.819]  They won't let her answer the phone.
[03:16:28.959 --> 03:16:30.420]  She asked them in front of everybody.
[03:16:30.559 --> 03:16:32.799]  She goes, can I please just answer the phone and tell my husband if you're okay?
[03:16:32.920 --> 03:16:33.979]  She said, no, no, no.
[03:16:34.239 --> 03:16:34.799]  Sit down.
[03:16:34.920 --> 03:16:36.399]  Don't touch your phone until you're in Tokyo.
[03:16:36.799 --> 03:16:38.040]  And then they buckled her up.
[03:16:38.420 --> 03:16:41.260]  By this time, the crew, the passenger already complaining.
[03:16:41.540 --> 03:16:44.100]  They're like, let the woman say goodbye to her husband, whatever.
[03:16:44.299 --> 03:16:44.860]  And they said, no.
[03:16:45.489 --> 03:16:51.809]  Anyways, they leave the aircraft, they closed the doors, the flight attendant came back with that folder that had the test questions in it.
[03:16:52.450 --> 03:16:57.930]  Handed it to my wife, she opened it up, and that's when she realized it had changed all her answers to no, or to yes.
[03:16:58.409 --> 03:17:00.090]  And there was nothing she could do at that point.
[03:17:00.190 --> 03:17:03.489]  I didn't know what was going on at that point.
[03:17:03.569 --> 03:17:05.250]  In fact, they already told her two hours into...
[03:17:05.250 --> 03:17:06.229]  Hold on, we gotta go to break.
[03:17:06.370 --> 03:17:09.389]  We're gonna come back and finish up, then I'm gonna air a promo, we're gonna bring on our other guests.
[03:17:09.489 --> 03:17:10.889]  But this is important, because this...
[03:17:11.760 --> 03:17:13.700]  Again, the illegal aliens are exempt from the shots.
[03:17:13.799 --> 03:17:14.860]  They try to make everybody else take them.
[03:17:14.940 --> 03:17:15.940]  They give them all this free stuff.
[03:17:16.120 --> 03:17:19.000]  They give them six, seven, eight year out immigration hearings.
[03:17:19.100 --> 03:17:23.420]  But then citizens, veterans get harassed like this and it's because they put you in a database.
[03:17:23.459 --> 03:17:26.059]  It's come out to harass the hell out of you.
[03:17:26.770 --> 03:17:27.709]  I'm in the database.
[03:17:28.069 --> 03:17:30.649]  I had lawyers sent in four years, three years ago, two years ago, a year ago.
[03:17:30.729 --> 03:17:32.250]  The government will not even respond illegally.
[03:17:32.590 --> 03:17:34.469]  And they do similar crap to me.
[03:17:34.590 --> 03:17:35.069]  We'll be right back.

[03:18:43.829 --> 03:18:47.489]  It's all riveting stuff, you know, former Delta Force, you name it.
[03:18:48.670 --> 03:18:52.389]  In closing, total harassment of you and your wife, obviously in the database being harassed.
[03:18:52.989 --> 03:18:55.069]  Finishing up that story and then tell us about the book briefly.
[03:18:55.549 --> 03:18:59.670]  Yeah, so at the end of the day, literally falsified my wife's documents.
[03:18:59.909 --> 03:19:04.629]  I actually went through Senator Marco Rubio's office three times, had him investigated.
[03:19:05.129 --> 03:19:10.129]  Twice I got a letter back saying, which is a boilerplate response, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:19:10.290 --> 03:19:22.819]  Third time I got a little upset, I sent him a little bit more of a threatening letter saying, listen, I'm gonna pursue this legally because You've had people within that actually violate my wife's rights, my rights as a veteran, as American citizen.
[03:19:23.239 --> 03:19:26.280]  And that's when it came back and started quoting statutes and threatening me.
[03:19:27.059 --> 03:19:31.840]  And I was actually surprised that at the senator level, they have actually very little power.
[03:19:32.120 --> 03:19:33.219]  They did all they could for me.
[03:19:33.440 --> 03:19:36.180]  But I'm still gonna try to push that envelope a little bit.
[03:19:36.319 --> 03:19:39.459]  But the reality was they falsified my wife's documents.
[03:19:39.879 --> 03:19:40.479]  They lied.
[03:19:40.959 --> 03:19:41.680]  Outright lied.
[03:19:42.299 --> 03:19:43.979]  They did an internal investigation.
[03:19:43.979 --> 03:19:46.219]  They said all the officers said they didn't do anything wrong.
[03:19:46.340 --> 03:19:47.420]  Of course, they're gonna say that.
[03:19:48.840 --> 03:19:50.079]  But anyways, it is what it is.
[03:19:50.159 --> 03:19:54.239]  That's why I'm here is one to tell the story that we're all potential victims.
[03:19:54.659 --> 03:19:57.540]  It's not just the big machine will gobble up everybody.
[03:19:58.379 --> 03:20:01.420]  Including veterans, and they don't care what we've done for our country.
[03:20:01.959 --> 03:20:02.860]  They haven't helped me.
[03:20:03.020 --> 03:20:04.799]  I don't see that they're gonna help me and my wife.
[03:20:04.899 --> 03:20:05.819]  They're gonna leave us out there.
[03:20:06.020 --> 03:20:08.719]  As I said in the beginning of the show, they've cast us to the wolves.
[03:20:08.780 --> 03:20:10.180]  It's up to me to protect my family.
[03:20:10.260 --> 03:20:10.920]  That's why I'm here.
[03:20:11.540 --> 03:20:20.219]  And moreover, I'm here for everybody else, because we need to wake up and be ready to stand against the machine, because they work for us.
[03:20:20.399 --> 03:20:22.200]  I keep reminding you, they work for us.
[03:20:24.119 --> 03:20:26.780]  Yeah, so, again, Alex, thanks for having me on the show.
[03:20:27.340 --> 03:20:28.659]  I do have another book out.
[03:20:28.979 --> 03:20:31.100]  The one you were just showing was American Badass.
[03:20:31.219 --> 03:20:32.579]  I had written that several years ago.
[03:20:32.940 --> 03:20:36.040]  I have a new one coming out, Running the Razor's Edge.
[03:20:36.120 --> 03:20:37.280]  It should be out in about 30 days.
[03:20:37.399 --> 03:20:40.639]  You can find it on DaleComstock.com when it's ready to be published.
[03:20:41.399 --> 03:20:43.600]  Well, Dale, what are you going to talk about when you're on with Owen today at 4 p.m.
[03:20:43.700 --> 03:20:43.879]  Central?
[03:20:45.020 --> 03:20:45.799]  You know...
[03:20:46.879 --> 03:20:51.899]  I'd really like to get into the nuances of what happened because I want people to understand just...
[03:20:51.899 --> 03:21:01.299]  I mean, I just kind of gave you a general story about what happened to my wife and I. And people really need to understand just how this whole system is broken.
[03:21:02.659 --> 03:21:13.459]  It's not in any way, you know, everything's so compartmented that the Department of Homeland Security is not talking to USICS, which is not talking to CBP. And there's all these...
[03:21:14.030 --> 03:21:23.030]  And then the other thing is, as a civilian, as a citizen, as a veteran, I've got to dole out a lot of money to attorneys just to get my wife...
[03:21:23.030 --> 03:21:25.309]  And it's all designed to make it where people just come in illegally.
[03:21:25.729 --> 03:21:27.870]  Dale Comstock, thank you so much for being here with us.
[03:21:28.209 --> 03:21:30.370]  Hopefully with 0-2, there's ribbiting stuff you got into.
[03:21:31.030 --> 03:21:32.489]  Wargaming, globalist, false flags.
[03:21:32.629 --> 03:21:33.909]  That is so important with your expertise there.
[03:21:34.030 --> 03:21:34.829]  Thank you so much for coming in.
[03:21:34.979 --> 03:21:35.659]  Thanks for having me.
[03:21:35.719 --> 03:21:36.079]  Appreciate it.
[03:21:36.159 --> 03:21:42.180]  We'll be right back with more on the biggest fraud ever, caught red-handed, hiding in plain view in Michigan on the election.
[03:21:42.180 --> 03:21:43.159]  The steal is on.
[03:21:43.459 --> 03:21:44.360]  Is it too big to rig?
[03:21:44.459 --> 03:21:45.180]  We're going to find out soon.
[03:21:45.280 --> 03:21:45.700]  Stay with us.
[03:21:46.579 --> 03:21:54.920]  So, I'm just asking you to keep me in the fight, and we got great t-shirts and incredible blow-you-away supplements and everything, and our great sponsor, DallasJonesStore.com.
[03:21:55.239 --> 03:22:08.579]  There's a VIP section on there that I noticed was getting really a lot of traction, because I hadn't really, you know, because other folks on this, other folks that are great run this, the folks at Bigly, great Patriot backers, total Patriots, J-Sexers, you name it.
[03:22:09.659 --> 03:22:11.840]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[03:22:12.040 --> 03:22:15.780]  So, when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[03:22:16.360 --> 03:22:26.579]  So, if you're a member of the Alex Jones VIP Club at alexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP, or there's just a big link at the top of the page, this is a critical time in our nation.
[03:22:26.979 --> 03:22:29.399]  We don't know what the future holds for the operation.
[03:22:29.860 --> 03:22:33.840]  The following information I'm about to relay to you is imperative so we can stay in touch.
[03:22:34.000 --> 03:22:37.059]  You can get great products and keep me on the air one way or the other along with the crew.
[03:22:37.360 --> 03:22:38.700]  Monthly member credits.
[03:22:39.040 --> 03:22:44.299]  Every month as a VIP member you get $40 of free store credit.
[03:22:44.600 --> 03:22:45.739]  Did you hear what I just said?
[03:22:45.840 --> 03:22:46.200]  That's right.
[03:22:46.379 --> 03:22:49.879]  It's like money in your pocket with the best products on the planet.
[03:22:50.120 --> 03:22:54.219]  So you pay 30 bucks to be a VIP. And then you get 40 bucks free.
[03:22:54.360 --> 03:22:55.299]  That's $10 you make.
[03:22:55.459 --> 03:23:06.139]  All the Alex Jones products at the best prices, we're talking about 10 to even 40% off the already existing sales, sometimes it becomes lost leaders, in the store 24-7, 365 days a year.
[03:23:06.540 --> 03:23:10.059]  This is an unbeatable pricing you'll never find anywhere else.
[03:23:10.559 --> 03:23:18.840]  Automatic double entries in any of the giveaways, like the awesome turbo diesel super truck, $138,000 value, plus $1,000 cash.
[03:23:19.639 --> 03:23:22.200]  The winner of the sweepstakes we announced on the 30th this month.
[03:23:22.579 --> 03:23:23.219]  You want to win?
[03:23:23.420 --> 03:23:24.360]  I know you do.
[03:23:24.540 --> 03:23:27.120]  Because the VIP will get double entries in every single giveaway.
[03:23:27.420 --> 03:23:29.760]  No effort, just double your chances just like that.
[03:23:30.260 --> 03:23:32.000]  Exclusive VIP-only giveaways.
[03:23:32.239 --> 03:23:33.899]  This is where it gets big, folks.
[03:23:34.020 --> 03:23:37.520]  VIP members get entered into their own exclusive giveaways every month.
[03:23:37.639 --> 03:23:39.239]  Nobody else is allowed in these.
[03:23:39.450 --> 03:23:42.030]  Early access to products, promos, and giveaways.
[03:23:42.350 --> 03:23:47.309]  VIP members get first access to new products, promotions, and giveaways before anyone else.
[03:23:47.469 --> 03:23:48.549]  You're in the know.
[03:23:48.950 --> 03:23:50.770]  Oh, and did I mention orders over $99?
[03:23:51.389 --> 03:23:51.969]  Free shipping.
[03:23:51.989 --> 03:23:55.129]  We're not letting shipping costs slow you down.
[03:23:55.129 --> 03:23:56.549]  It just goes on from there.
[03:23:57.590 --> 03:24:03.670]  TheAllowShowStore.com forward slash VIP. Or just at the top of TheAllowShowStore.com, you see the VIP button.
[03:24:03.969 --> 03:24:06.030]  We're fighting the new world order.
[03:24:06.129 --> 03:24:07.889]  I don't have billionaire backers.
[03:24:08.030 --> 03:24:12.590]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[03:24:12.590 --> 03:24:14.030]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[03:24:14.750 --> 03:24:15.770]  TheAllowShowStore.com.
[03:24:16.459 --> 03:24:22.059]  It's up to you whether you want to back the number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[03:24:22.299 --> 03:24:31.360]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[03:24:31.540 --> 03:24:38.639]  And I just don't know why I'm such a lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[03:24:38.760 --> 03:24:40.780]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[03:24:41.280 --> 03:24:43.719]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[03:24:44.180 --> 03:24:44.959]  We've already...
[03:24:45.760 --> 03:24:46.920]  Just devastated them.
[03:24:47.059 --> 03:24:50.079]  I mean, world government, the dual orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[03:24:50.319 --> 03:24:51.659]  The whole world's turning against them.
[03:24:52.120 --> 03:24:55.940]  They're super dangerous as they're throwing the kitchen sink at us to try to keep control.
[03:24:56.340 --> 03:25:06.600]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've ever understood, that I should let these criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[03:25:06.799 --> 03:25:08.420]  So, again, I don't give up.
[03:25:08.600 --> 03:25:11.280]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[03:25:12.010 --> 03:25:14.909]  I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[03:25:15.129 --> 03:25:17.370]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[03:25:17.510 --> 03:25:18.850]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[03:25:19.030 --> 03:25:27.569]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over us with a social credit score and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[03:25:27.750 --> 03:25:32.549]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum.
[03:25:33.649 --> 03:25:35.930]  And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[03:25:37.559 --> 03:25:38.420]  I mean, it's just...
[03:25:38.420 --> 03:25:39.760]  This is a joke.
[03:25:40.079 --> 03:25:41.239]  This is ridiculous.
[03:25:41.719 --> 03:25:42.799]  We're changing the world.
[03:25:42.920 --> 03:25:45.760]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
[03:25:47.120 --> 03:25:52.040]  We're five days, nine hours till November 5th in the election, but it's already in full swing.
[03:25:52.280 --> 03:25:54.360]  Massive attempt to steal the election in front of everyone.
[03:25:54.700 --> 03:25:55.680]  It's so huge.
[03:25:55.840 --> 03:25:58.440]  I'm going to be filing emergency reports today, war room, everything.
[03:25:59.100 --> 03:26:00.399]  And it's not Elon Musk.
[03:26:00.479 --> 03:26:01.659]  He admits he still has moles.
[03:26:01.799 --> 03:26:04.579]  He got rid of 90% of the employees at X when he took over Twitter.
[03:26:05.139 --> 03:26:19.360]  But when we go super viral and start getting tens of millions of views on X, they go in and remove the counterbox on real Alex Jones and And don't show the video feed because people see millions watching, millions more go, oh, I better see that.
[03:26:19.700 --> 03:26:21.100]  They've done that to the feed today.
[03:26:21.200 --> 03:26:28.780]  So go to Real Alex Jones, get the live show feed at the top, share it on X, say they're censoring this, they're blocking it, attention Elon, they're not showing the count feed.
[03:26:29.020 --> 03:26:30.719]  It's shadow banning, just like Joe Rogan.
[03:26:31.479 --> 03:26:33.399]  Just like they wouldn't let it be searchable or see it.
[03:26:33.479 --> 03:26:34.760]  You gotta ram it up their ass.
[03:26:34.899 --> 03:26:48.040]  You gotta get the link from X at Real Alex Jones of the live show feed right there at the top and infowars.com forward slash show that URL and email it, text message it and say here's the censored broadcast over the target.
[03:26:49.399 --> 03:26:53.959]  Now it broke two hours ago and I've been analyzing it and it's so huge it makes my head spin.
[03:26:55.399 --> 03:26:59.239]  Started hearing a week and a half ago from MTG on the show or now two weeks ago almost.
[03:27:00.229 --> 03:27:06.090]  That she's getting reports of flipped Republican straight tickets to Democrat straight tickets.
[03:27:06.909 --> 03:27:21.469]  Then the Secretary of State, total deep state operative, Soros operative, Hillary operative, comes out today and says, oh yeah, the Republican Party, the head of their election integrity, yeah, they've been gotten the database, and yeah, there was more fraudulent votes and flipping yesterday.
[03:27:21.709 --> 03:27:22.489]  It's just a little glitch.
[03:27:22.629 --> 03:27:23.469]  It's happening all over the country.
[03:27:24.250 --> 03:27:25.530]  And it's no big deal.
[03:27:26.899 --> 03:27:29.739]  Nationwide issue with Dominion voting machines.
[03:27:29.799 --> 03:27:31.219]  I thought Dominion's totally perfect.
[03:27:31.360 --> 03:27:32.340]  You're not supposed to question them.
[03:27:33.340 --> 03:27:38.600]  So exactly what was reported four years ago, and now again, is happening.
[03:27:38.959 --> 03:27:46.000]  And then Fox just settles a $700 million lawsuit, doesn't even fight it, because Murdoch is in with them.
[03:27:48.079 --> 03:27:52.379]  So that's supposed to discredit that this exists, and then here it all is happening.
[03:27:53.739 --> 03:27:54.260]  Unbelievable.
[03:27:54.879 --> 03:27:55.399]  Unbelievable.
[03:28:01.279 --> 03:28:01.719]  Unbelievable.
[03:28:01.719 --> 03:28:06.979]  Oh, look, Department of State issues update for voters using Dominion voter assist terminals for 2024 general election.
[03:28:07.100 --> 03:28:07.639]  Print that for me.
[03:28:09.100 --> 03:28:10.520]  That came out a few days ago.
[03:28:14.680 --> 03:28:16.700]  Oh, it flips you when you're straight partying it.
[03:28:16.719 --> 03:28:17.459]  What's it flipping it to?
[03:28:18.680 --> 03:28:20.200]  Turns out that was days ago.
[03:28:20.379 --> 03:28:33.700]  We're just now learning about it because the head of the Republican Party's Director for Trump 2024 campaign Republican National Committee, James Blair, is getting it.
[03:28:35.120 --> 03:28:36.540]  So, oh, it was a rumor!
[03:28:36.840 --> 03:28:38.440]  Oh, but it wasn't!
[03:28:39.559 --> 03:28:40.000]  Wow!
[03:28:40.899 --> 03:28:44.719]  Everybody's so scared of the opinion, oh no, there's nothing happening, we're not going to talk about it!
[03:28:45.239 --> 03:28:46.680]  Certainly there wasn't any...
[03:28:47.720 --> 03:28:48.479]  Evil involved.
[03:28:48.840 --> 03:28:50.860]  I mean, just get used to it.
[03:28:51.840 --> 03:28:52.219]  Wow.
[03:28:53.079 --> 03:28:53.620]  All right.
[03:28:54.340 --> 03:28:55.479]  I'm going to say this right now.
[03:28:55.620 --> 03:28:57.040]  We're in a total information war.
[03:28:57.159 --> 03:29:02.559]  When you share the feeds, when you share the articles, when you share the videos, you devastate the globalists.
[03:29:02.899 --> 03:29:06.840]  And when you fund this operation, you are literally, you are the tip of the spear.
[03:29:06.920 --> 03:29:08.219]  You're not funding the tip of the spear.
[03:29:08.340 --> 03:29:15.659]  You are the tip of the spear when you share the reports, pray for the broadcast, and buy great, amazing products that will blow you away.
[03:29:16.920 --> 03:29:21.780]  At thealexjonesstore.com and our other great sponsor, my dad's supplement company, drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:29:21.959 --> 03:29:23.719]  Those are the coordinates of freedom.
[03:29:24.879 --> 03:29:26.299]  Take action now.
[03:29:26.879 --> 03:29:39.659]  Now, a lot happening today, and I want to bring a great patriot on here, Nate Hughes, from Bigly, who are some of the best patriot producers of Made in America Knives, T-shirts, everything, and they've just gotten way behind us.
[03:29:39.780 --> 03:29:41.139]  We've been talking to them for a long time.
[03:29:41.280 --> 03:29:42.860]  It took a few months to gear up.

[03:31:08.809 --> 03:31:10.270]  He's a J6-er as well.
[03:31:11.309 --> 03:31:16.049]  And he's an entrepreneur, an American patriot, a business owner.
[03:31:16.389 --> 03:31:17.489]  And he's with us.

[03:31:21.569 --> 03:31:23.469]  Nate, good to talk to you.
[03:31:23.549 --> 03:31:25.010]  Good to break things down.
[03:31:25.190 --> 03:31:25.809]  I mean, wow.
[03:31:25.989 --> 03:31:28.690]  First off, what do you make of the illegals?
[03:31:28.809 --> 03:31:29.569]  Fed saying they can vote.
[03:31:29.670 --> 03:31:30.610]  Supreme Court saying no.
[03:31:34.100 --> 03:31:42.440]  We're good to go.
[03:31:46.280 --> 03:31:48.000]  So they can supply whatever fraud they need.
[03:31:48.860 --> 03:31:50.600]  Texas saying illegals can vote.
[03:31:51.059 --> 03:31:51.639]  Secretary of State.
[03:31:51.819 --> 03:31:53.739]  I mean, this is just out in the open.
[03:31:53.860 --> 03:31:57.280]  And now Michigan going, yeah, it's a nationwide problem.
[03:31:57.579 --> 03:32:03.159]  It's flipping people's ballots and there's more people voting than actually voted.
[03:32:03.200 --> 03:32:04.239]  We don't know who they are.
[03:32:04.340 --> 03:32:05.559]  We don't know what's going on.
[03:32:06.409 --> 03:32:12.510]  And the State Department confirming it, we now learn that's five days ago, and we just now learn about it because the Trump campaign finds out about it.
[03:32:12.590 --> 03:32:13.549]  What else don't we know?
[03:32:13.649 --> 03:32:19.610]  So this is a big rumor when MTG came on, totally vindicated a week and a half ago, on the 18th of October.
[03:32:20.590 --> 03:32:21.950]  I mean, this is crazy.
[03:32:22.090 --> 03:32:22.870]  What do you make of this?
[03:32:25.309 --> 03:32:26.629]  Alex, thanks for having me on.
[03:32:28.809 --> 03:32:37.329]  We're almost going through a replay of 2020, which I don't know if I'm allowed to say that, but I'm going to be honest in, you know, I guess a time of crisis, right?
[03:32:37.670 --> 03:32:39.409]  You can say whatever the hell you want on this show.
[03:32:40.290 --> 03:32:40.649]  Good.
[03:32:41.229 --> 03:32:41.590]  100%.
[03:32:41.590 --> 03:32:44.909]  Just my lawyers may not like that, but I really don't give a damn anymore.
[03:32:45.209 --> 03:32:45.569]  So...
[03:32:46.850 --> 03:32:49.450]  We have to stop illegals from voting.
[03:32:49.590 --> 03:32:51.250]  We have to count all legal votes.
[03:32:51.690 --> 03:32:55.170]  Just like what Elon Musk has said, we need same-day voting.
[03:32:55.170 --> 03:32:56.690]  We need paper ballots, right?
[03:32:57.190 --> 03:32:58.809]  But we've got to get through this election.
[03:32:58.930 --> 03:33:01.049]  We've got to get through the next week.
[03:33:01.530 --> 03:33:17.100]  I'm praying to God that we know that Trump is the winner on the evening of November 5th because I feel like if it goes after that, We're going to get those weird little hockey sticks of vote dumps coming in, and I really hope that doesn't happen again, because if that does,
[03:33:17.180 --> 03:33:21.440]  we're going to have to deal with a shit show of a future.
[03:33:22.700 --> 03:33:25.819]  We have to stop the illegals from voting, number one, and...
[03:33:26.720 --> 03:33:28.100]  The ballot drop boxes.
[03:33:28.219 --> 03:33:29.340]  Why are we still doing that?
[03:33:29.860 --> 03:33:31.620]  Didn't we learn our lesson in 2020?
[03:33:31.879 --> 03:33:32.959]  I mean, I guess we have.
[03:33:33.020 --> 03:33:35.639]  If we have this giant legal team, we're able to fight it.
[03:33:35.799 --> 03:33:37.739]  We have X, so we have free speech, right?
[03:33:38.719 --> 03:33:43.600]  I think having X and having the ability to get any kind of election fraud evidence or any kind of...
[03:33:44.579 --> 03:33:48.139]  I guess, stolen ballot information out there.
[03:33:48.219 --> 03:33:52.059]  I mean, that's a good thing, but what are we gonna do to fight back, right?
[03:33:52.639 --> 03:33:54.959]  I guess lawsuits, I don't know what that's gonna do, right?
[03:33:55.059 --> 03:33:56.879]  We need to stop the fraud now.
[03:33:57.000 --> 03:34:03.879]  And the big thing we have to do is not only do we have to go vote, but we have to bring five, 10, 20 of our friends to go vote.
[03:34:04.020 --> 03:34:11.319]  If you're in a damn swing state, if you're in Pennsylvania, if you're in Georgia, if you're in Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, any of them, right?
[03:34:11.860 --> 03:34:17.180]  You have to go today and make a plan to vote and bring your friends with you to vote.
[03:34:17.340 --> 03:34:18.959]  Bring your family with you to vote.
[03:34:19.379 --> 03:34:22.899]  Bring the guy that you see when you're going to get lunch every Friday, right?
[03:34:23.020 --> 03:34:24.760]  You see him on the street, homeless guy.
[03:34:25.059 --> 03:34:26.100]  Bring his ass to vote.
[03:34:26.399 --> 03:34:28.299]  Make sure he's registered at his current address, right?
[03:34:28.459 --> 03:34:29.600]  But we gotta get...
[03:34:29.600 --> 03:34:32.280]  It's gotta be a wave of people going to vote.
[03:34:32.479 --> 03:34:39.500]  I think the good things we have going right now are we have early voting numbers are off the charts for Republicans.
[03:34:40.159 --> 03:34:41.139]  We have...
[03:34:41.819 --> 03:34:50.219]  People turning out that never turned out, that didn't vote for Romney in 2012, that didn't vote for Trump in 2016, didn't vote 2020.
[03:34:50.500 --> 03:34:55.540]  They are motivated to vote now because I think they see that this is a turning point for our country.
[03:34:55.579 --> 03:34:58.459]  And if we don't win this, you know, our country's lost.
[03:34:58.780 --> 03:35:00.659]  So, yeah, Alex, thanks for having me on.
[03:35:00.879 --> 03:35:00.879]  And I totally agree.
[03:35:01.000 --> 03:35:02.879]  I'm fired up about this election, so.
[03:35:03.149 --> 03:35:05.790]  And with the enemy trying to shut us down, you guys are so critical.
[03:35:06.069 --> 03:35:08.590]  You're also huge sponsors for a bunch of other great patriots.
[03:35:09.569 --> 03:35:11.450]  You guys did an amazing job.
[03:35:11.549 --> 03:35:13.829]  You've gotten so many great products up at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:35:13.969 --> 03:35:15.889]  You are critical in us being able to continue forward.
[03:35:16.129 --> 03:35:19.209]  Tell me about all the stuff happening today at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:35:20.600 --> 03:35:20.860]  Sure.
[03:35:21.079 --> 03:35:23.659]  So, over the past, I guess, let's just say two months, right?
[03:35:23.819 --> 03:35:28.659]  We've gotten, I'd say, 30, 40, 50 new t-shirt designs up, hats, hoodies.
[03:35:30.139 --> 03:35:31.340]  We've got the DMO knife.
[03:35:31.360 --> 03:35:34.120]  We've got another one we're about to drop soon.
[03:35:34.120 --> 03:35:35.319]  It's a Made in the USA knife.
[03:35:35.440 --> 03:35:36.100]  Very nice knife.
[03:35:36.739 --> 03:35:38.079]  And then the supplements, right?
[03:35:38.920 --> 03:35:42.680]  I know you were on us and we talked a lot about, hey, we got to get some good, high-quality supplements.
[03:35:42.879 --> 03:35:46.719]  So, you know, we took the marching orders and we went out and found, you know, the best products on the market.
[03:35:47.219 --> 03:35:49.719]  The CMOS, it's, you know, I actually have it right here.
[03:35:50.360 --> 03:35:50.840]  Where is it?
[03:35:51.719 --> 03:35:52.639]  CMOS. These are great.
[03:35:53.079 --> 03:35:56.600]  CMOS caps, it's organic CMOS, super high-quality stuff.
[03:35:56.780 --> 03:35:59.139]  We've got the new Hydra Force electrolyte drink mix.
[03:35:59.280 --> 03:36:03.059]  So we went out and got some great new supplements, and we have some other ones on the way.
[03:36:03.520 --> 03:36:16.299]  And our whole goal is bringing high-quality merchandise, high-quality supplements, Just good quality products in general to patriots all around the USA. And we're just excited to do it.
[03:36:16.440 --> 03:36:19.440]  We've got almost 100 employees here in Arkansas that are working.
[03:36:19.780 --> 03:36:21.260]  We've got three shifts going now.
[03:36:21.379 --> 03:36:24.479]  We're working six, seven days a week, and we're busy.
[03:36:24.579 --> 03:36:30.200]  We love our country, and we love working with people that, I guess, support each other.
[03:36:30.360 --> 03:36:35.659]  So you support us, we support you, and it's Americans supporting like-minded Americans, and that's what we like to do.
[03:36:35.760 --> 03:36:36.200]  Yeah.
[03:36:36.299 --> 03:36:38.719]  And it's so important, the Patriot t-shirts right now.
[03:36:39.079 --> 03:36:40.260]  And you don't just make them for us.
[03:36:40.340 --> 03:36:41.120]  You make them for so many people.
[03:36:41.379 --> 03:36:42.040]  Great designs.
[03:36:42.319 --> 03:36:43.540]  Everybody know we're the majority.
[03:36:43.540 --> 03:36:44.079]  We're here.
[03:36:44.180 --> 03:36:46.600]  It's like a uniform in this information war.
[03:36:46.799 --> 03:36:48.639]  The big truck giveaway.
[03:36:49.360 --> 03:36:50.540]  That's the last day today.
[03:36:50.840 --> 03:36:51.540]  Tell people about that.
[03:36:52.719 --> 03:37:02.979]  Yeah, so these truck giveaways over the past couple of years with, you know, five, six, seven different people, Hodge Twin, Steven Crowder, a bunch of different people, you know, we do these promotions where we give trucks away with them, right?
[03:37:03.239 --> 03:37:08.399]  We've given away, I think, close to $3 million in trucks and prizes over the past almost three years now.
[03:37:08.920 --> 03:37:12.139]  And, you know, these promos run 30, 60, 90 days, depending.
[03:37:12.440 --> 03:37:20.319]  But the end of these promotions, the end of these giveaways is when the majority of these people win because a lot of people have that FOMO, that fear of missing out, right?
[03:37:20.739 --> 03:37:29.950]  And at the end of these giveaways, you know, You get five times the entries, ten times the entries, which means if you buy a $30 t-shirt, you'll get 300 entries into the promotion.
[03:37:30.229 --> 03:37:33.290]  So it's the best time to get entered to win these things.
[03:37:33.510 --> 03:37:38.090]  The majority of the winners have come on the last day or the last week of these giveaways.
[03:37:38.229 --> 03:37:45.680]  So go to therealalexjonesstore.com, get a t-shirt, get a hat, Get the CMOS. I love the CMOS. I take the CMOS every day now.
[03:37:45.760 --> 03:37:48.440]  And the electrolyte drink mix, the HydroForce, it's great too.

[03:38:10.309 --> 03:38:12.190]  So it's here.
[03:38:12.549 --> 03:38:15.649]  And the way sweepstakes rules, we follow the state laws.
[03:38:15.850 --> 03:38:18.530]  It'll be a few weeks or however long until the winter gets announced.
[03:38:18.629 --> 03:38:20.149]  But tonight is the last.

[03:39:16.350 --> 03:39:18.350]  That's on top of the sales that are already there.
[03:39:19.239 --> 03:39:20.399]  Yes, on top of it.
[03:39:20.479 --> 03:39:23.899]  So if you're getting a CMOS right now, introductory price is 40% off.
[03:39:24.040 --> 03:39:27.299]  You can take an additional 20% off and use your store credit.
[03:39:27.559 --> 03:39:30.219]  You know, we had talked, and I think some of these are a loss leader.
[03:39:30.319 --> 03:39:35.959]  We're not making much money on it, but the good thing is we're getting good quality products in people's hands at a time when...
[03:39:36.859 --> 03:39:41.079]  I guess the information war is really heating up, and we've got to keep you on air, Alex.
[03:39:41.620 --> 03:39:47.219]  You are the tip of the spear, right, in this information war, and we've got to keep you on air.
[03:39:48.299 --> 03:39:51.819]  Some of these deals are so good, it's not making any money.
[03:39:52.200 --> 03:39:55.120]  I kind of asked you guys, I said, look, I don't mind some sales, but knock it off.
[03:39:56.079 --> 03:39:57.379]  So the point...
[03:39:57.700 --> 03:40:03.979]  That's why we have a few t-shirts that are the fundraiser shirts and everything fundraisers, but that are marked up from $25, $30 to $50.
[03:40:04.180 --> 03:40:09.600]  So we actually get, because these t-shirts are nice, they cost like $15, $16, depending on the size for us, not to mention the printing.
[03:40:09.959 --> 03:40:18.219]  So when you get them for $50, like the classic InfoWars or the Punisher, Rebellion to Tyrants, Obedience to God shirt, then we actually get some real money in here.
[03:40:18.280 --> 03:40:22.440]  So people who want to go the extra mile, plus they're great limited edition shirts, get those.
[03:40:22.600 --> 03:40:25.360]  When you see those, the ones that are marked up, that's the ones that really get...
[03:40:28.260 --> 03:40:28.500]  Yep.
[03:40:29.639 --> 03:40:31.020]  We only got about a minute and a half left.
[03:40:31.139 --> 03:40:31.780]  What else do you want to say?
[03:40:31.840 --> 03:40:32.860]  And I really want to thank you for your support.
[03:40:32.940 --> 03:40:33.920]  You guys have knocked it out of the park.
[03:40:34.020 --> 03:40:34.959]  Your team, we love what you're doing.
[03:40:36.079 --> 03:40:38.979]  Hey, all we needed was the opportunity, right?
[03:40:39.159 --> 03:40:42.840]  So give us an opportunity and we will knock it out of the park every time, right?
[03:40:43.620 --> 03:40:44.100]  I'd say...
[03:40:45.709 --> 03:40:54.430]  If it's me personally, if I knew a way to support you and support InfoWars and support the Alex Jones Network going forward, I'd be a VIP club member, right?
[03:40:54.489 --> 03:40:55.569]  That's the first thing I would do.
[03:40:55.790 --> 03:40:58.149]  And I would buy those fundraiser t-shirts, right?
[03:40:58.329 --> 03:41:01.069]  We actually just dropped, I believe, another 10 new designs today.
[03:41:01.190 --> 03:41:03.309]  New t-shirts, new hats, a couple new hoodies as well.
[03:41:04.090 --> 03:41:06.350]  Just go to thealexjonesstore.com and support.
[03:41:06.549 --> 03:41:08.989]  And also, at the same time, you're entered to win a truck.
[03:41:09.149 --> 03:41:11.450]  You're entered to win a $110,000 giveaway, right?
[03:41:11.569 --> 03:41:11.930]  Yeah.
[03:41:11.969 --> 03:41:13.049]  The badass Ram truck.
[03:41:13.250 --> 03:41:14.629]  You get $10,000 in cash.
[03:41:14.770 --> 03:41:17.690]  We're flying you in to Austin, Texas to meet Alex.
[03:41:17.889 --> 03:41:19.889]  And I think we're going to get some barbecue too, right?
[03:41:19.950 --> 03:41:22.069]  Are we going to Terry Black's or where are we going to take them?
[03:41:22.469 --> 03:41:23.690]  We'll go somewhere good.
[03:41:24.030 --> 03:41:24.729]  Absolutely, brother.
[03:41:24.809 --> 03:41:25.989]  Let me just show TV viewers this.
[03:41:25.989 --> 03:41:26.469]  This is breaking.
[03:41:26.590 --> 03:41:27.489]  Now it's on Fox News.
[03:41:28.090 --> 03:41:32.549]  Voter registration probes launched in critical key states and counties.
[03:41:32.610 --> 03:41:33.809]  It claims potential fraud.
[03:41:34.170 --> 03:41:34.569]  Claims?
[03:41:34.670 --> 03:41:36.569]  It's just mass scamming going on.
[03:41:36.790 --> 03:41:38.250]  This is insane, brother.
[03:41:39.450 --> 03:41:40.610]  We got to stop this.
[03:41:41.030 --> 03:41:41.430]  Like...
[03:42:01.930 --> 03:42:04.799]  I don't know Make this thing too big to rig.
[03:42:04.959 --> 03:42:07.940]  If it's too big to rig, you know, we always say that, what are they?
[03:42:08.280 --> 03:42:14.040]  Can they turn the boat by 3%, 4%, 5% maybe with their different strategies that they do?
[03:42:14.120 --> 03:42:15.500]  I don't know, personally, but...
[03:42:15.500 --> 03:42:16.239]  We can overpower.
[03:42:16.459 --> 03:42:18.459]  Nate Hughes, we'll talk to you soon.
[03:42:18.540 --> 03:42:19.200]  Great job.
[03:42:19.459 --> 03:42:20.659]  Thank you for keeping us on air.
[03:42:20.780 --> 03:42:21.459]  Thanks to the listeners.
[03:42:21.819 --> 03:42:22.840]  Owen Schreier takes over now.
[03:42:23.040 --> 03:42:23.620]  Big news breaking.
[03:42:23.860 --> 03:42:25.059]  You see it everywhere.
[03:42:25.340 --> 03:42:26.360]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:42:26.520 --> 03:42:27.600]  Alex Jones is vindicated.
[03:42:28.600 --> 03:42:36.479]  I personally appreciate folks that defend me because I've been through a lot of attacks from the deep state and the corporate media and their minions.
[03:42:37.159 --> 03:42:43.319]  But really, it's more important to me that people realize that I've not been playing games and I've been accurate about 98% of the time.
[03:42:43.440 --> 03:42:45.100]  I've never gotten things wrong on purpose.
[03:42:45.260 --> 03:42:46.260]  I've never lied to you on purpose.
[03:42:46.399 --> 03:42:46.940]  I've made mistakes.
[03:42:47.799 --> 03:42:55.059]  The reason I like the vindication is people can now pay more attention to what I'm currently saying about what's happening in the world.
[03:42:55.159 --> 03:42:59.280]  And we're reaching tens of billions of new people every day.
[03:42:59.540 --> 03:43:00.959]  I mean, this is amazing.
[03:43:01.520 --> 03:43:03.819]  Just on X alone, but all over the place.
[03:43:03.979 --> 03:43:05.260]  And that's thanks to you spreading the word.
[03:43:05.959 --> 03:43:09.059]  But there's one part of the equation that if it fails, the whole thing falls.
[03:43:10.059 --> 03:43:17.299]  Infowars is up for sale, could easily be shut down on November 13th, a few days after the election, which we now know is going to be contested.
[03:43:17.860 --> 03:43:19.940]  And the deep state wants me off really, really bad.
[03:43:20.059 --> 03:43:22.579]  But regardless of that, if our sponsors are backed...
[03:43:23.300 --> 03:43:29.700]  There's been backup systems set up, and things are ready to continue on regardless of what happens.
[03:43:29.840 --> 03:43:34.100]  But the funds are not there to make sure we can hire the whole crew, the folks I'm working with.
[03:43:34.139 --> 03:43:38.280]  The funds are not there yet to make sure we get the rest of the equipment that's needed with the folks I'm working with.
[03:43:38.559 --> 03:43:40.840]  So I need you to support my sponsors.
[03:43:40.840 --> 03:43:42.659]  Plus, it's really easy to do.
[03:43:43.489 --> 03:43:49.149]  These are amazing products with five-star reviews with my dad's company, drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:43:49.250 --> 03:44:00.709]  And it's got a lot of the classic supplements I've promoted for years, but also a lot of new proprietary ones and other top products, private labeled by my dad, who will always back me as long as he gets the support.
[03:44:01.149 --> 03:44:14.450]  So please visit drjonesnaturals.com, the best toothpaste out there, fluoride-free, fortified with nano-silver, iodine, does incredible things in the mouth, tea tree, peppermint, organic, concentrated.

[03:44:27.030 --> 03:44:28.969]  Next level, foundational energy.
[03:44:29.170 --> 03:44:31.469]  Oh, you think you've heard of all the energy pills out there?
[03:44:31.870 --> 03:44:34.629]  This isn't an energy pill, but it gives you energy.
[03:44:34.950 --> 03:44:45.190]  It is the breakdown that the cells create of folic acid, methylfolate with a bunch of other natural compounds that supercharge it into the cells like organic B-complex.
[03:44:48.569 --> 03:44:52.610]  This cleans out the mitochondria, gives you instant energy within 30 minutes with no letdown.
[03:44:52.770 --> 03:44:53.750]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:44:53.889 --> 03:44:58.889]  And a lot of people have issues with processing folic acid, particularly Northern Europeans.
[03:44:59.290 --> 03:45:00.590]  But everybody feels it.
[03:45:00.690 --> 03:45:05.409]  But if you've had an issue in your cells, you can have your genetics tested for this if you want.
[03:45:05.469 --> 03:45:05.930]  A lot of people do.
[03:45:06.149 --> 03:45:10.209]  And you find out you've got broken genes for absorbing folic acid.
[03:45:11.060 --> 03:45:14.840]  Be careful and just take one pill the first time because it's crazy.
[03:45:15.120 --> 03:45:17.819]  You want to experience Next Level Foundational Energy.
[03:45:17.920 --> 03:45:21.819]  Just like our information, it's absolutely amazing, and I know you're going to want to order it again.
[03:45:22.000 --> 03:45:26.700]  We have something like an 85% reorder rate, my dad does, on this product.
[03:45:26.920 --> 03:45:27.959]  People love it.
[03:45:28.579 --> 03:45:29.979]  So a limited supply came back in.
[03:45:30.079 --> 03:45:34.100]  Get your next level of financial energy now at drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:45:34.219 --> 03:45:38.040]  There's also the natural sleep aid that works really good, even if you don't have trouble sleeping.
[03:45:38.180 --> 03:45:40.680]  It makes it deeper, more restful, so good for your immune system.
[03:45:41.100 --> 03:45:42.120]  Try Rocket Rest.
[03:45:42.120 --> 03:45:47.299]  If you want a stimulant that's all natural and really works well, well, that's top brain, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:45:47.500 --> 03:45:48.000]  It's strong.
[03:45:48.159 --> 03:45:49.260]  People are blown away by it.
[03:45:49.579 --> 03:45:51.399]  They're like, wow, this is something else.
[03:45:51.520 --> 03:45:52.799]  Yeah, we're not playing games.
[03:45:53.100 --> 03:45:57.639]  And then, of course, there's a good, high-quality, staple, organic base, so it's not synthetic.
[03:45:58.000 --> 03:46:01.959]  Whole food, concentrate, multivitamin, good basis, and...
[03:46:02.809 --> 03:46:03.649]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[03:46:03.829 --> 03:46:04.930]  Foundation for everything you're doing?
[03:46:05.049 --> 03:46:05.829]  That's a good staple.
[03:46:06.030 --> 03:46:10.969]  If you're looking for high-quality multivitamin, it's a private label of a very top, high-rated one that's got five stars.
[03:46:11.370 --> 03:46:17.889]  And so many other great products, like the concentrated seed sprouts that are so good for your gut, so good for your body.
[03:46:18.290 --> 03:46:25.110]  Just some of the sprouts, your gut uses them, it's a long story, to create a special type of...
[03:46:25.569 --> 03:46:30.850]  Amino acids that only your intestines can create that helps regrow tendons, muscle.
[03:46:31.049 --> 03:46:32.889]  I mean, it's gut wall health.
[03:46:33.010 --> 03:46:35.309]  You want to get fiber green concentrates.
[03:46:35.549 --> 03:46:39.329]  All of these products and more are at drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:46:39.469 --> 03:46:47.090]  So if you want to back what we're doing, you want to keep us on the air, and your great products at the same time, go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:46:47.250 --> 03:46:49.709]  I mean, quite frankly, folks, we can't do this without you.
[03:46:51.019 --> 03:46:55.219]  If we had some big billionaires that wouldn't control what I said, wouldn't have given me money, I would take it.
[03:46:55.280 --> 03:46:56.020]  But that's not happening.
[03:46:56.200 --> 03:47:01.219]  I'm backed by common folks just like you, just like Trump mainly is backed by small donations.
[03:47:01.520 --> 03:47:03.979]  And so you can see it as a donation, but it's not.
[03:47:04.139 --> 03:47:06.139]  I want to form a long-term relationship with you.
[03:47:06.280 --> 03:47:08.200]  I want you to see how great these products are.
[03:47:08.239 --> 03:47:08.979]  My dad does.
[03:47:09.120 --> 03:47:10.719]  I need to sponsor into the future.
[03:47:10.879 --> 03:47:14.020]  So I want you to get high-quality products that really work so you come back.
[03:47:14.840 --> 03:47:15.399]  Again and again.
[03:47:15.520 --> 03:47:18.360]  Like a restaurant that serves really good, healthy, high quality, delicious food.
[03:47:18.559 --> 03:47:19.659]  I want the line around the block.
[03:47:19.819 --> 03:47:20.840]  My dad wants the line around the block.
[03:47:21.629 --> 03:47:23.270]  My dad wants the line around the block.
[03:47:23.510 --> 03:47:27.350]  So you've got to try it to see how great it is, DRJonesNaturals.com.
[03:47:27.450 --> 03:47:30.870]  And separately, our other big sponsor is the AlexJonesStore.com.

[03:47:36.629 --> 03:47:37.889]  There's some amazing designs.
[03:47:38.149 --> 03:47:40.450]  Some of the shirts are $20, $25, $30.
[03:47:40.809 --> 03:47:44.389]  But there are two shirts, the classic InfoWars red on navy blue.
[03:47:45.780 --> 03:47:56.360]  And a rebellion to tyrants shirt that are both $50 that have extra markup in them if you really want to support us being sure we have the funds we need to go in the future.
[03:47:56.579 --> 03:47:59.299]  And on my children, we are behind on funds.
[03:48:00.659 --> 03:48:05.000]  I haven't been defeated yet because you've been backing me, but we are so close right now.
[03:48:05.299 --> 03:48:14.520]  And so I'm here asking for your support and asking you humbly to take action now and get great products at thealexjonesstore.com as well as drjonesdadryls.com.

[03:49:33.909 --> 03:49:38.290]  Because I hadn't really, you know, because other folks on this, other folks that are great run this.
[03:49:38.430 --> 03:49:42.129]  The folks at Bigly, great patriot backers, total patriots, J-sexers, you name it.
[03:49:43.209 --> 03:49:45.389]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[03:49:45.610 --> 03:49:49.329]  So when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.

[03:51:39.780 --> 03:51:41.440]  I don't have billionaire backers.
[03:51:41.620 --> 03:51:46.159]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[03:51:46.340 --> 03:51:47.579]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[03:51:48.379 --> 03:51:49.319]  Theallowshowstore.com.
[03:51:49.920 --> 03:51:55.600]  It's up to you whether you want to back The number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[03:51:55.860 --> 03:52:04.920]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[03:52:05.120 --> 03:52:12.180]  And I just don't know why I'm such a lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[03:52:12.299 --> 03:52:14.319]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[03:52:14.840 --> 03:52:17.280]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[03:52:17.719 --> 03:52:18.340]  We've already...
[03:52:19.370 --> 03:52:20.469]  Just devastated them.
[03:52:20.610 --> 03:52:23.610]  I mean, world government, the New World orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[03:52:23.850 --> 03:52:25.190]  The whole world's turning against them.
[03:52:25.649 --> 03:52:26.770]  They're super dangerous.
[03:52:26.909 --> 03:52:29.489]  They're throwing the kitchen sink, trying to keep control.
[03:52:29.909 --> 03:52:40.149]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've understood, that I should let these criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[03:52:40.329 --> 03:52:41.950]  So, again, I don't give up.
[03:52:42.110 --> 03:52:44.850]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[03:52:45.340 --> 03:52:48.459]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[03:52:48.680 --> 03:52:50.920]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[03:52:51.040 --> 03:52:52.420]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[03:52:52.579 --> 03:53:01.139]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over the social credit score, and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[03:53:01.280 --> 03:53:06.079]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum.
[03:53:07.219 --> 03:53:09.459]  And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[03:53:11.110 --> 03:53:11.969]  I mean, it's just...
[03:53:11.969 --> 03:53:13.309]  This is a joke.
[03:53:13.610 --> 03:53:14.790]  This is ridiculous.
[03:53:15.270 --> 03:53:16.350]  We're changing the world.
[03:53:16.469 --> 03:53:19.290]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
