[00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.451]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:22.937]  joining forces with the Trump campaign has been the most unifying act we've seen in America for years.
[00:00:23.237 --> 00:00:25.419]  Don't you want healthy children?
[00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:32.309]  And don't you want the chemicals out of our food?
[00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:39.835]  And don't you want the regulatory agencies to be free from corporate corruption?
[00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.601]  And that's what President Trump told me that he wanted.
[00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:52.326]  He also told me that he wanted to end the grip of the neocons on U.S.
[00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.227]  foreign policy.
[00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:02.968]  And don't you want a president who's gonna get us out of the wars and who's gonna rebuild the middle class in this country?
[00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:07.890]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:09.171]  Wednesday, August 28, 2024.
[00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:10.291]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:01:10.551 --> 00:01:14.793]  And don't you want a president that's gonna make America healthy again?
[00:01:14.813 --> 00:01:24.217]  Thank you all very, very much, and God bless you, and God bless America.
[00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:26.628]  And right after Bobby Jr.
[00:01:26.668 --> 00:01:28.972]  gave support, Tulsi Gabbard followed.
[00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:33.080]  Whether you're a Democrat, a Republican, or an Independent...
[00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:54.676]  If you love our country as I do, if you cherish peace and freedom as we do, I invite you to join me in doing all that we can to save our country and elect President Donald J. Trump and send him back to the White House to do the tough work of saving our country and serving the people.
[00:01:55.176 --> 00:01:57.857]  Following this historic political realignment,
[00:01:58.217 --> 00:02:06.922]  Less than three months from the 2024 election, Mark Zuckerberg admits that he censored information on Facebook at the direction of the federal government.
[00:02:07.362 --> 00:02:10.024]  It doesn't take a prophet to see what's coming next.
[00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:17.348]  The rising action of this story is leading to a massive response, something big enough to suspend the elections.
[00:02:17.728 --> 00:02:23.331]  If they really think they're going to lose, if they haven't locked it down, and I don't know the answer to that because I'm not privy to their plans,
[00:02:24.592 --> 00:02:45.558]  But if they think that there's a chance that Trump could win decisively enough in November that they can't steal it, then I think their only option there is to, in some way, throw the society into chaos, as they did during COVID, which was the pretext for changing the way we vote and letting people vote anonymously without IDs and drop boxes and a month before the election, etc.
[00:02:45.578 --> 00:02:51.419]  They completely changed everything, allowing Mark Zuckerberg to spend $400 million to control the mechanics of the election.
[00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:53.360]  That would not have been allowed except
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.584]  Under a state of national emergency provided them by the virus they created in a lab in Wuhan, COVID.
[00:03:00.304 --> 00:03:02.506]  And so it's just it's pretty simple.
[00:03:02.726 --> 00:03:05.468]  If they feel like they're going to lose, we will have some kind of crisis.
[00:03:05.528 --> 00:03:08.430]  I think it's most likely to be a war with Iran, which they want anyway.
[00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.531]  But, you know, who knows?
[00:03:09.891 --> 00:03:18.076]  Four years ago, Klaus Schwab warned us that a cyber attack is coming that will make COVID pale in comparison to its devastation.
[00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:41.299]  To the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack, which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole.
[00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:53.530]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack.
[00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:01.137]  And just this month, the World Economic Forum posts an article entitled, Four Global Risks to Look Out For.
[00:04:01.437 --> 00:04:17.758]  In the post pandemic era, the article suggests that no matter what the official outcome of the 2024 elections is, the people will not trust it and says that democracy has been in decline for 18 consecutive years and the people are looking for something different.
[00:04:18.198 --> 00:04:33.864]  The article cites the WHO, saying that the COVID pandemic was the greatest threat to mental health since the Second World War, and that a new eco-anxiety is likely to escalate as governments fail to transition away from fossil fuels fast enough.
[00:04:34.504 --> 00:04:43.548]  The article suggests that 50% of jobs will be wiped away by 2027, and that a violent backlash against AI is inevitable.
[00:04:44.188 --> 00:04:59.358]  It warns of an era of unexpected destabilizing shock events, where a new global extremist group emerges, which may use AI to kick off a new phase of terrorism, such as an intentional cyber pandemic.
[00:04:59.938 --> 00:05:16.087]  This goes along with the Rockefeller Foundation's Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development, which says if the people reject the new AI control grid, the system will have to resort to violence and deceptive false flags in order to bring it about.
[00:05:17.047 --> 00:05:19.569]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:05:35.527 --> 00:05:36.247]  Big Brother.
[00:05:37.228 --> 00:05:38.489]  Mainstream media.
[00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:40.670]  Government cover-ups.
[00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.771]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:44.712]  Well, so does he.
[00:05:45.552 --> 00:05:50.255]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:03.874 --> 00:06:14.737]  We are live broadcasting worldwide with 68 days, 12 hours, 53 minutes, 33 seconds, and the most important election in world history!
[00:06:15.497 --> 00:06:18.358]  This is the Alex Jones Show LIVE!
[00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:23.599]  And we better wake up and get out of our trances!
[00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:26.520]  Or the New World Order's gonna eat our lunch!
[00:06:31.713 --> 00:06:39.259]  We're 144 days out to the inauguration of Trump because we got the 76 days of hell once he gets elected.
[00:07:01.081 --> 00:07:05.522]  And we're in the chase right now with 68 days left.
[00:07:08.743 --> 00:07:13.724]  We are broadcasting worldwide from the Embattled Studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:07:14.584 --> 00:07:15.885]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:07:19.306 --> 00:07:24.967]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, wait until we lay out the news today.
[00:07:28.547 --> 00:07:42.845]  The governor yesterday or two days ago in Texas with the task force went through the voter rolls and found 1.1 million ineligible fraudulent people on the voter rolls.
[00:07:43.806 --> 00:07:46.950]  Over half a million illegal aliens and dead people.
[00:07:49.562 --> 00:08:01.710]  And with that data that they've been collating for months, they then raided a bunch of Democrat Party offices of state reps, you name it today, running the illegal alien operations.
[00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:05.412]  Kind of a big deal.
[00:08:05.432 --> 00:08:15.639]  And all over the country, they just pulled a hundred plus thousand illegal aliens and dead voters off the rolls in Nevada.
[00:08:18.766 --> 00:08:24.030]  And they're pulling them off all over the country where Republicans have just a sliver of control.
[00:08:25.651 --> 00:08:28.053]  That's why the Democrats are in total panic mode.
[00:08:29.695 --> 00:08:47.829]  And that's why you have the New York Times and the Washington Post and even CNN coming out and openly saying that Kamala is weak, phony, ignorant, and shallow.
[00:08:50.964 --> 00:08:51.544]  Think about that.
[00:08:52.345 --> 00:08:55.166]  That's the establishment now turning on her.
[00:08:56.527 --> 00:08:57.547]  Why are they doing that?
[00:08:57.587 --> 00:09:01.189]  That's a very important question.
[00:09:01.229 --> 00:09:02.670]  Because you can say, well, that's just the New York Times.
[00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:03.390]  Well, that's just CNN.
[00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:09.413]  They don't have big audiences, but they are the mouthpieces of the New World odor.
[00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:11.894]  And you can smell it.
[00:09:11.954 --> 00:09:13.535]  It smells like death because it is.
[00:09:15.296 --> 00:09:17.236]  We have this incredible stack.
[00:09:17.277 --> 00:09:20.158]  I could spend all four hours on this stack and these videos alone.
[00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:29.997]  We have Jack Smith indicting Trump again, and it's basically double jeopardy.
[00:09:31.057 --> 00:09:34.059]  Because the Supreme Court said he did the stuff he did on January 6th.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.181]  He's not been indicted for a crime there.
[00:09:38.102 --> 00:09:39.743]  He told people to be peaceful in the Capitol.
[00:09:40.143 --> 00:09:44.566]  He's been indicted for questioning the election, which even if he was wrong, it's just right, but the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:49.890]  I mean, Trump lost Georgia, we lost Georgia by 7,000 votes.
[00:09:52.253 --> 00:09:52.933]  Michigan by what, 11,000?
[00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:55.094]  It goes on from there.
[00:09:56.455 --> 00:10:04.218]  And you've got hundreds of thousands of illegals and dead people voting per state, and they barely won because they'd already lost despite all the fraud.
[00:10:04.538 --> 00:10:14.843]  They had to then close the polling places in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, and other battleground states.
[00:10:14.923 --> 00:10:18.765]  Put up paper, no matter what state they were in, over the windows,
[00:10:20.017 --> 00:10:27.139]  Kick out the Republican poll watchers, even though it was 7-1 Democrat in Michigan, and it is again, there's lawsuits over it.
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.601]  And then bring in those special truckloads of ballots with Joe Biden on them and feed them into the machines.
[00:10:33.641 --> 00:10:43.184]  But it still wasn't enough, so they had to rerun the same ballots in Georgia, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, in other states, over and over again.
[00:10:45.785 --> 00:10:50.406]  And they still, because they were just like, whoo, just get a few extra thousands until he wins.
[00:10:51.466 --> 00:10:52.546]  We're tired and quit.
[00:10:52.746 --> 00:10:56.747]  They didn't, you know, they could have fed in hundreds of thousands more, but they got tired.
[00:10:57.827 --> 00:11:02.848]  They would just get right, like a liberal, right, just barely even half-ass get the theft done.
[00:11:05.549 --> 00:11:12.570]  And now in Michigan, they have the attorney general put in by Soros and the governor put in by Soros and other states saying, we're going to arrest you.
[00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.731]  We're going to indict you if you question the election.
[00:11:17.182 --> 00:11:20.423]  And you're a poll watcher, even though that's your right and duty.
[00:11:21.063 --> 00:11:29.546]  They are so scared right now because Trump's 20 points ahead nationwide, 10-15 points ahead in battlegrounds.
[00:11:29.847 --> 00:11:31.687]  They've only got a margin of 10% fraud.
[00:11:32.107 --> 00:11:32.488]  R.M.K.
[00:11:32.508 --> 00:11:32.828]  Jr.
[00:11:32.848 --> 00:11:35.289]  just came in, brought at least 6-7 points in.
[00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:41.231]  That's why they announced yesterday in Wisconsin and in Michigan
[00:11:42.168 --> 00:11:50.890]  Now they're saying other states, they're not going to let him off the battleground state ballots, hoping the constituents are dumb and vote for him instead of Trump.
[00:11:56.931 --> 00:12:03.773]  The deep state can also steal elections by having some of the votes go in for RFK instead of Trump, electronically.
[00:12:05.133 --> 00:12:10.514]  So it is just absolutely wild what's going on.
[00:12:12.728 --> 00:12:22.030]  And then you dovetail all this with the letter that came out 36 hours ago from Zuckerberg saying, I was told to election medal.
[00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.610]  I was told to cover up COVID.
[00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.710]  I was told I was following orders.
[00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:32.411]  The Nuremberg defense that you're just following orders doesn't cut it.
[00:12:33.892 --> 00:12:38.913]  Then it's set to pass committee and go, and they say they have the votes, SB1414.
[00:12:41.468 --> 00:12:48.370]  Makes raping a child punishable by two days in county jail.
[00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.551]  Not the 20 years in prison.
[00:12:51.591 --> 00:12:52.851]  You should get more, but that's the law.
[00:12:52.891 --> 00:12:53.431]  There are 20 years.
[00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:55.232]  They're repealing the law.
[00:12:55.932 --> 00:12:59.253]  Not one day of prison will be spent.
[00:13:00.633 --> 00:13:06.675]  And meanwhile, in the UK, the government has announced if you say you're sorry for rape or stabbing someone,
[00:13:07.697 --> 00:13:14.961]  You get no jail time and they were letting people out who have murdered people with machetes after six months in prison.
[00:13:15.802 --> 00:13:16.202]  In jail.
[00:13:17.943 --> 00:13:19.244]  And it's because their victims were white.
[00:13:19.664 --> 00:13:20.925]  You cannot avoid this.
[00:13:21.625 --> 00:13:22.726]  It is a fact, UK.
[00:13:23.486 --> 00:13:26.688]  Prime Minister Starmer ignores rapes, stabbings, robberies.
[00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:32.452]  Instead calls nationalists, who are tired of it, Nazis.
[00:13:34.821 --> 00:13:37.923]  Also, the deep state Democrats are getting really desperate.
[00:13:37.943 --> 00:13:41.366]  So this story itself isn't that important, but it's important to understand what they're doing.
[00:13:42.507 --> 00:13:54.996]  I reported almost four weeks ago, when she had a pretty big crowd in Michigan, in Deerfield, that they had said that Taylor Swift was going to be there.
[00:13:55.716 --> 00:13:57.698]  Because I saw that in the comments, hey, where's Taylor Swift?
[00:13:57.758 --> 00:14:00.400]  And it was Democrat real accounts, like the low level.
[00:14:02.267 --> 00:14:07.351]  And I saw they'd already bait-and-switched and said other big stars would be at other events, then it wouldn't be that star, it would be a lesser star.
[00:14:07.812 --> 00:14:14.337]  They would just advertise on the radio, hey, free concert this Wednesday, and they'd get there, and the concert would play, and then everybody leaves, and Kamala's standing there alone.
[00:14:15.798 --> 00:14:28.109]  So at the DNC, last week as you know, they announced, oh, surprise guests, Beyonce, Taylor Swift, oh, a bunch of, oh, they're gonna be there, and use big influencers.
[00:14:29.025 --> 00:14:32.168]  Not even low-level ones, very brazen like Lemon to do it.
[00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.833]  It's the same thing about we're going to give you free, you know, no tax on tips.
[00:14:36.954 --> 00:14:37.794]  Well, they'll do the opposite.
[00:14:37.814 --> 00:14:39.296]  Or we're going to give you all this other free stuff.
[00:14:39.336 --> 00:14:42.860]  And of course, they never really give it to you unless you're an illegal alien because they want to have a real incentive for new voters.
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.442]  They already got you as a Democrat voter.
[00:14:44.462 --> 00:14:45.563]  They don't care about you.
[00:14:45.663 --> 00:14:48.306]  Remember, Hillary famously said, thank God Democrats are so dumb.
[00:14:50.026 --> 00:14:50.726]  I'll get to this later.
[00:14:51.587 --> 00:15:07.233]  Now, on the official Kamala Harris for President X account, and everywhere else, they published a fake letter from Tucker Carlson and said, well, Tucker Carlson, even though we disagree with you on a lot of things, we're glad you agree we should ban all semi-automatic guns.
[00:15:07.853 --> 00:15:09.313]  Now, it's not Tucker's handwriting.
[00:15:09.353 --> 00:15:10.414]  It's not Tucker's signature.
[00:15:11.752 --> 00:15:16.276]  They just say Tucker, then imply it's Tucker Carlson as another hoax.
[00:15:17.236 --> 00:15:20.619]  It's all they have got.
[00:15:21.319 --> 00:15:23.241]  Like Trump says all Mexicans are criminals.
[00:15:23.641 --> 00:15:24.202]  Where's the clip?
[00:15:25.403 --> 00:15:26.163]  Never said anything like it.
[00:15:27.104 --> 00:15:30.927]  Or Alex Jones harassed families of dead children and peed on their graves.
[00:15:31.928 --> 00:15:32.348]  Where is it?
[00:15:32.648 --> 00:15:33.249]  Where's the evidence?
[00:15:33.869 --> 00:15:34.490]  It doesn't exist.
[00:15:35.791 --> 00:15:35.971]  But...
[00:15:37.657 --> 00:15:42.519]  People weren't awake like they are six years ago when they were on every channel every day for years.
[00:15:42.619 --> 00:15:44.060]  Alex Jones pees on graves.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.100]  Well, that bastard.
[00:15:49.662 --> 00:15:50.162]  That's what they do.
[00:15:51.442 --> 00:15:53.883]  So now, Tucker Carlson wrote a letter calling for banning guns.
[00:15:53.903 --> 00:15:54.484]  No, he didn't.
[00:15:55.864 --> 00:15:56.604]  But they don't care.
[00:15:56.644 --> 00:15:58.925]  It's all part of rooking you.
[00:15:58.985 --> 00:16:01.026]  It's all part of scamming you.
[00:16:01.066 --> 00:16:05.628]  They love... You know, for these Satanists, the journey is the destination.
[00:16:08.151 --> 00:16:13.754]  They just love lying and scamming and frauding and stealing and poisoning people.
[00:16:15.575 --> 00:16:22.399]  And if you look at them, Jack Smith and Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and King Charles, they're all a bunch of scum.
[00:16:22.999 --> 00:16:27.521]  So, of course, they hate themselves, so they project that hatred onto you.
[00:16:30.723 --> 00:16:35.806]  Also, in just the last few days, so many articles, I can't even keep track of it,
[00:16:37.114 --> 00:16:42.676]  Five athletes have collapsed with heart attacks, young athletes, and of course one of them died.
[00:16:42.696 --> 00:16:47.298]  27-year-old football player dies after suddenly collapsing during match.
[00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:50.079]  It's just the new normal.
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.801]  And all the major studies admit, including Harvard, it is the shots.
[00:16:55.862 --> 00:16:57.783]  But they go, oh, but the risk of COVID's worse.
[00:16:57.943 --> 00:16:58.383]  No, it's not.
[00:16:58.443 --> 00:16:59.143]  That's a lie, too.
[00:16:59.163 --> 00:16:59.783]  The numbers are there.
[00:17:00.504 --> 00:17:02.124]  Wow, so it's just hidden in plain view now.
[00:17:02.224 --> 00:17:06.165]  Yeah, the shots are causing massive heart attacks and blood clots and strokes.
[00:17:06.366 --> 00:17:07.286]  Big deal.
[00:17:07.946 --> 00:17:08.866]  Turbo cancers.
[00:17:08.906 --> 00:17:10.047]  Who wants to live anyways?
[00:17:10.147 --> 00:17:11.327]  You know, we're just killing you.
[00:17:11.427 --> 00:17:12.167]  Ha ha!
[00:17:13.288 --> 00:17:18.170]  But like you're easing yourself into a hot bath and then turning the heat up even more, boiling the frog.
[00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.691]  That's what's happening to people that aren't waking up in this.
[00:17:22.871 --> 00:17:25.312]  They are succumbing to it.
[00:17:27.128 --> 00:17:32.991]  Then we've got a ton of news today we're going to be getting to.
[00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:38.754]  We also have some huge guests I'll tell you about coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:17:41.735 --> 00:17:49.219]  And this is a viewer and listener participation Paul Revere sport where you fight for your lives.
[00:17:49.599 --> 00:17:50.900]  Really, it's gladiatorial, isn't it?
[00:17:52.782 --> 00:18:02.111]  And so, trying to stop World War 3, trying to stop poison shots, trying to stop poison 5G, trying to stop poison GMO, trying to stop the poison endocrine disruptors.
[00:18:03.888 --> 00:18:08.631]  And that's why you need to go to InfoWars.com forward slash show and band up video of the live Alex Jones feed section.
[00:18:09.212 --> 00:18:12.214]  And the easiest place is X. Real Alex Jones.
[00:18:12.574 --> 00:18:16.757]  Follow us there and take the live show feeds of this broadcast.
[00:18:17.077 --> 00:18:18.658]  An American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[00:18:19.319 --> 00:18:24.843]  And The War with Owen Schroer where these guys have incredible guests and incredible callers and incredible analysis and breaking news.
[00:18:25.243 --> 00:18:26.684]  I think we got some pretty powerful guests too.
[00:18:26.944 --> 00:18:27.965]  Tucker Carlson yesterday.
[00:18:30.767 --> 00:18:32.388]  Dr. David Martin tomorrow.
[00:18:33.726 --> 00:18:35.347]  Other big guests will tell you about coming up today.
[00:18:37.108 --> 00:18:41.029]  But most of you are already awake, probably more than I do in many cases.
[00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:42.790]  What's the goal here?
[00:18:44.011 --> 00:18:53.435]  Well, it's getting new people to understand how grave the situation is.
[00:18:54.556 --> 00:19:01.199]  You know, you can sit there and see some UN paid hacker, Pfizer hack,
[00:19:04.704 --> 00:19:11.429]  Wear their little white lab coats on TV, and say, hey, I'm a doctor, I'm a science, don't question me.
[00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:20.596]  Just like I could put on a Stetson, open road hat, and tell you that I'm a cattle baron.
[00:19:22.157 --> 00:19:22.658]  But I'm not.
[00:19:24.219 --> 00:19:29.063]  You've gotta look into, actually, what somebody's bona fides are.
[00:19:30.697 --> 00:19:33.298]  What their actual credentials are, what their history is.
[00:19:33.978 --> 00:19:40.219]  And when you look at the Democratic Party and the globalist parties around the world, they're the biggest pack of lying criminals the world has ever seen.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:58.724]  Now, my family does actually own cattle, and I've actually worked around cattle my whole life, and I've aided doing cesarean sections on cows and horses, and I've run electric dehorners, and personally, you know, dehorn up to 500 cows a day, and I've
[00:19:59.895 --> 00:20:05.657]  Do a pretty good job riding the back of a horse and putting a lasso around a cow's horns and dragging their ass into a pen if I need to.
[00:20:06.257 --> 00:20:07.877]  But I wouldn't even call myself a cowboy.
[00:20:08.758 --> 00:20:14.119]  Hell, probably in the aggregate, working three years on ranches all together, I'm a nobody compared to those guys.
[00:20:15.419 --> 00:20:20.301]  But the difference is, I'm not all hat, no cap.
[00:20:23.602 --> 00:20:26.723]  But that's what you're dealing with when you deal with the establishment.
[00:20:27.163 --> 00:20:27.583]  They don't
[00:20:28.703 --> 00:20:31.985]  Care about you, they hate you, and they are frauds.
[00:20:33.686 --> 00:20:48.033]  So if you see Chuckie Schumer, you know, suddenly telling you that he's a world champion bull rider, like Bobby Steiner, my good friend, you're not really.
[00:20:49.033 --> 00:20:49.733]  And that's the difference.
[00:20:51.875 --> 00:20:56.557]  And I saw this little hat I've got.
[00:20:57.714 --> 00:20:58.534]  We're good to go.
[00:21:20.032 --> 00:21:21.953]  And two guests on the broadcast as well.
[00:21:21.973 --> 00:21:24.835]  Actually three, because Daniel Estelin is an amazing source of info.
[00:21:24.856 --> 00:21:26.036]  That guy's got the intel.
[00:21:26.537 --> 00:21:28.038]  Stories he's given me behind the scenes.
[00:21:28.838 --> 00:21:30.740]  The sources he's got are next to none.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:37.945]  Internationally, all over the world, from the Middle East, to Russia, to Latin America, to Europe, to Canada and the U.S.
[00:21:38.345 --> 00:21:42.748]  He's lived in Russia, Spain, France, you name it.
[00:21:43.348 --> 00:21:48.452]  He's worked, well he said himself, let it slip out before, he's worked in international intelligence groups.
[00:21:49.253 --> 00:21:49.413]  But,
[00:21:51.434 --> 00:22:01.422]  He's going to have massive news on what's really going on with the election and with the arrest of the Telegram owner and how dangerous that is in the fourth hour.
[00:22:03.624 --> 00:22:06.407]  We have an expert on the poison shots joining us.
[00:22:07.748 --> 00:22:08.829]  We'll also be looking at the economy.
[00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:16.053]  And more, but let me go ahead now and just show you some of these headlines, and then we'll drill into these bad boys when we come back.
[00:22:16.813 --> 00:22:17.153]  Breaking!
[00:22:17.173 --> 00:22:23.916]  New York Times turns on Kamala, publishes numerous op-eds on weak, phony, and ignorant Democratic Party.
[00:22:26.377 --> 00:22:26.677]  Breaking!
[00:22:26.717 --> 00:22:30.259]  Kamala agrees to pre-tape joint interview with Walls on CNN.
[00:22:30.539 --> 00:22:35.661]  Pre-taped with her little buddy, like she's sitting on his lap and she's one of those marionette dolls.
[00:22:40.202 --> 00:22:42.023]  Sit there and you're a ventriloquist and he talks.
[00:22:42.883 --> 00:22:44.604]  He's got Kamala in his lap.
[00:22:46.164 --> 00:22:48.305]  And he's sitting there moving the hand in her mouth.
[00:22:49.106 --> 00:22:51.887]  He's like, Kamala, how you doing?
[00:22:53.967 --> 00:22:57.129]  And she's, I'm doing really good here.
[00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:58.889]  Oh yeah, I can see my tail in the wind.
[00:22:58.909 --> 00:23:00.150]  Oh yeah, I'm doing good.
[00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:03.191]  Well, Kamala, you're very smart, aren't you?
[00:23:03.211 --> 00:23:03.851]  What's your IQ?
[00:23:04.512 --> 00:23:05.492]  My IQ is 185.
[00:23:11.661 --> 00:23:13.421]  I'm not that good at it.
[00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:15.422]  So, that's coming up.
[00:23:15.802 --> 00:23:19.843]  CNN's Dana Bash awarded first interview with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.
[00:23:21.003 --> 00:23:23.744]  O'Leary roast Kamala Harris for hiding from the press.
[00:23:23.784 --> 00:23:25.825]  Come out, come out wherever you are!
[00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:28.190]  Counselor!
[00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:29.910]  Counselor!
[00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:33.732]  Come out, come out, wherever you are!
[00:23:34.312 --> 00:23:38.894]  You think a couple whacks to my good ol' boy guts are gonna get me down?
[00:23:39.314 --> 00:23:42.135]  You got a lot to learn, Counselor!
[00:23:44.656 --> 00:23:53.860]  Zuckerberg admission of government censorship complex gives new life to Murphy vs. Missouri Supreme Court
[00:23:54.761 --> 00:23:56.261]  Case with plaintiff, Jim Hopley.
[00:23:56.301 --> 00:23:57.041]  We'll get into that.
[00:23:58.602 --> 00:24:02.743]  Majority of Democrats, voters, clueless about Kamala Harris's radical positions.
[00:24:03.063 --> 00:24:03.903]  That's how they want to keep it.
[00:24:05.323 --> 00:24:05.883]  RFK Jr.'
[00:24:05.863 --> 00:24:08.564]  's running mate, Nicole Shanahan, on today's Democrat Party.
[00:24:08.604 --> 00:24:09.064]  I'm shocked.
[00:24:09.424 --> 00:24:09.904]  I'm saddened.
[00:24:09.944 --> 00:24:10.564]  I'm worried for them.
[00:24:10.584 --> 00:24:11.524]  They've lost their soul.
[00:24:12.565 --> 00:24:17.606]  Massachusetts GOP demands information on $1 million shrouded in secrecy spent on migrants in the state.
[00:24:17.886 --> 00:24:18.886]  They're organizing them to vote.
[00:24:20.441 --> 00:24:24.885]  Totalitarian unconstitutional Tim Walz ban on Christian teachers set to hit schools in just months.
[00:24:25.225 --> 00:24:26.146]  Yeah, you didn't know that?
[00:24:26.927 --> 00:24:29.289]  Policies of Kamala Harris drive evangelicals towards Trump.
[00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.733]  Far-left presidential candidate Cornel West says Kamala tried to buy him off.
[00:24:34.473 --> 00:24:34.934]  Of course he did.
[00:24:35.234 --> 00:24:40.339]  California Democrats vote to force taxpayers to subsidize $150,000 down payment on homes for illegal aliens.
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.562]  And then Trump reposts photo with RFK Jr.
[00:24:44.602 --> 00:24:47.425]  captioned the strongest anti-establishment ticket in American history.
[00:24:49.241 --> 00:24:54.163]  Flip-flop, Kamala Harris now supports spending hundreds of millions of dollars building Trump's wall.
[00:24:54.203 --> 00:24:57.224]  That's just some of what we're going to be hitting.
[00:24:57.264 --> 00:25:04.006]  But first, when we return, I want to hit the election meddling stack.
[00:25:04.467 --> 00:25:06.007]  Dun, dun, dun.
[00:25:06.948 --> 00:25:07.788]  Jack Smith and all of it.
[00:25:08.108 --> 00:25:15.971]  And in here is Texas raiding Democrat Party offices.
[00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.631]  Oh, and what did they find?
[00:25:19.651 --> 00:25:20.431]  Hmm.
[00:25:22.072 --> 00:25:26.314]  Total criminal activity.
[00:25:26.414 --> 00:25:28.975]  And, oh, a little Tweety Bird, because I know they already know this.
[00:25:28.995 --> 00:25:30.256]  I'm not letting out information that's not known.
[00:25:30.296 --> 00:25:31.436]  I'm not giving the enemy a heads up.
[00:25:33.277 --> 00:25:34.277]  Because they're being watched.
[00:25:36.498 --> 00:25:40.240]  Act Blue is going to be having some visits very soon in Texas.
[00:25:41.981 --> 00:25:44.922]  In fact, I ain't even being, hmm.
[00:25:50.985 --> 00:25:51.866]  Oh, it's all hilarious.
[00:25:52.527 --> 00:25:54.349]  So, let's just say this.
[00:25:54.429 --> 00:25:57.372]  America was somewhat asleep four years ago when they stole the election.
[00:25:57.392 --> 00:25:59.934]  I mean, people thought they were awake, but they were like, oh, it's not that bad.
[00:26:00.014 --> 00:26:01.216]  Oh, it's worse than you can think.
[00:26:01.496 --> 00:26:09.264]  I mean, every time I think I'm overboarding it on how bad it is, it's almost always, in fact, the biggest mistake I make is underestimating the evil of the bad guys.
[00:26:10.225 --> 00:26:13.727]  Oh, that's my most common mistake, or I butcher names, or I flip dates around.
[00:26:14.527 --> 00:26:18.789]  And I listen to rebroadcasts sometimes, and I'm just like, I listen about an hour, and I'm like, oh, I found two mistakes.
[00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:19.910]  What is my problem?
[00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.151]  It's teleprompter-free, and the brain twists stuff.
[00:26:22.511 --> 00:26:25.333]  But I'm not getting things wrong on purpose.
[00:26:26.093 --> 00:26:28.615]  These people, again, are lying on purpose.
[00:26:29.735 --> 00:26:32.817]  So this critical stack is coming up.
[00:26:33.871 --> 00:26:34.672]  When we return.
[00:26:34.692 --> 00:26:36.293]  But I'll say it again, my Paul Reveres.
[00:26:36.553 --> 00:26:38.075]  Share the links at RealAlexJones.
[00:26:38.375 --> 00:26:40.477]  Share the links at Man.Video.
[00:26:40.537 --> 00:26:42.919]  Share the links at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:26:43.219 --> 00:26:44.821]  That's the coordinates to this broadcast.
[00:26:44.861 --> 00:26:51.246]  And for whatever reason, this broadcast is very successful, with the truth, at getting people that have been on the fence to wake up.
[00:26:51.767 --> 00:26:53.949]  And 37% of the country doesn't vote.
[00:26:55.026 --> 00:26:59.529]  And we're trying to get them to vote so that we get Trump in.
[00:26:59.549 --> 00:27:07.235]  And it won't be perfect, and Trump's going to be handed all these globalist disasters, but it's going to be a lot better than Kamala and Walls are going to try to finish the country off.
[00:27:09.056 --> 00:27:10.277]  So this isn't lesser to evils.
[00:27:10.337 --> 00:27:13.699]  It's total destruction, and we're doomed, or we got a fighting chance.
[00:27:14.079 --> 00:27:14.580]  I'm going to break.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.582]  Please remember, I can't do this alone.
[00:27:17.602 --> 00:27:18.422]  I need your help.
[00:27:18.442 --> 00:27:19.543]  This is not a one-way street.
[00:27:19.823 --> 00:27:20.464]  I'm not complaining.
[00:27:20.484 --> 00:27:23.226]  I'm just saying, I need you to
[00:27:24.482 --> 00:27:25.222]  Patronize us.
[00:27:27.083 --> 00:27:28.844]  I need you to be our patrons.

[00:27:38.327 --> 00:27:39.128]  I'm going to say this again.
[00:27:39.148 --> 00:27:43.529]  My favorite product on there is not even the Nano Silver Toothpaste that's amazing and all the other great products.
[00:27:43.649 --> 00:27:47.151]  It's Next Level Fundational Energy that is
[00:27:48.584 --> 00:27:53.467]  Not a stimulant, but has an incredible, hits in 30 minutes, stimulant effect.
[00:27:53.527 --> 00:28:03.113]  And if you're actually deficient, and your cells don't process folic acid properly like most white people's don't, that's a genetic defect in whites, it's a fact.
[00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:04.701]  We're good to go.
[00:28:33.274 --> 00:28:43.396]  Turmeric has been used as a medicine for thousands of years to treat digestive disorders, respiratory problems, arthritis, and depression.
[00:28:43.736 --> 00:28:56.079]  It has strong anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties, and is one of the most effective anti-inflammatory medications available.
[00:28:57.492 --> 00:29:15.086]  The powerful BODYS formula at infowarstore.com includes 95% curcuminoids, Boswellia serrata extract, organic sage leaf, organic lemon balm leaf, organic thyme leaf, and piperine from black pepper.
[00:29:15.586 --> 00:29:19.990]  BODYS is arguably the best tumeric formula available.
[00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:21.131]  Get it now.

[00:29:38.174 --> 00:29:42.998]  All right, let's get to Kevin O'Leary talking about Kamala Harris hiding in the basement.
[00:29:43.018 --> 00:29:58.251]  She's now agreed to her first interview since she was selected and stalled with zero votes in the primaries, like Ronald McDonald or Grimace or the Hamburglar or Lucky Charms or the Tooth Fairy.
[00:29:58.872 --> 00:29:59.612]  Zero votes.
[00:30:00.313 --> 00:30:03.656]  She is now going to do a Dana Bash softball interview with her handler.
[00:30:03.756 --> 00:30:08.239]  I guess she'll be sitting on his lap, again, like she's a marionette doll.
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.643]  And it's going to be taped so they can cut out any gaps.
[00:30:14.484 --> 00:30:19.488]  Now, she's agreed to a September 10th debate on ABC News.
[00:30:20.829 --> 00:30:23.031]  Trump has agreed.
[00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:26.357]  She's trying to have it one-sided with her rules.
[00:30:26.397 --> 00:30:29.278]  He wants CNN rules, the same rules they had on CNN with Biden.
[00:30:29.638 --> 00:30:30.178]  They've agreed.
[00:30:30.738 --> 00:30:32.539]  So Trump last night said, I'm in.
[00:30:33.139 --> 00:30:35.940]  Now, you know we're going to be covering that.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.101]  I mean, I'm looking forward to that.
[00:30:39.021 --> 00:30:41.102]  Covering the DMC, we had more viewers than I thought we would.
[00:30:41.122 --> 00:30:42.082]  We actually had a lot of viewers.
[00:30:42.643 --> 00:30:43.803]  But that was pure torture.
[00:30:44.283 --> 00:30:46.924]  Though we did get the nice clips of them saying lies and expose them.
[00:30:46.944 --> 00:30:48.545]  So it was well worth the torture.
[00:30:48.585 --> 00:30:52.006]  But man, I feel like that took years off my life last week.
[00:30:53.228 --> 00:30:59.034]  This is going to put the years back on my life because Trump is going to mop the floor with that idiot.
[00:30:59.734 --> 00:31:01.616]  She cannot talk without a teleprompter.
[00:31:02.016 --> 00:31:03.378]  She is a complete moron.
[00:31:04.258 --> 00:31:05.419]  And so get ready.
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:06.340]  Here's Kevin O'Leary.
[00:31:07.922 --> 00:31:12.466]  There is no scenario where the President of the United States can't head up a press conference.
[00:31:12.846 --> 00:31:15.309]  Under any scenario, every president
[00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:20.544]  Every president has been able to address the press and in the good times and the bad times.
[00:31:21.545 --> 00:31:24.306]  She has to start talking to the press.
[00:31:25.267 --> 00:31:25.827]  Period.
[00:31:26.128 --> 00:31:27.429]  There's no optionality.
[00:31:27.449 --> 00:31:32.372]  There's no scenario where anybody would be comfortable, particularly in the swing states, with swing voters.
[00:31:32.392 --> 00:31:34.313]  I was thinking to myself, what have we got here?
[00:31:34.733 --> 00:31:36.274]  Why won't she talk to the press?
[00:31:36.875 --> 00:31:38.336]  I'm asking it from a policy guy.
[00:31:38.616 --> 00:31:40.137]  I need explanations for these policies.
[00:31:40.157 --> 00:31:41.438]  I have to invest in these policies.
[00:31:41.878 --> 00:31:44.340]  I have questions and I don't get any answers.
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:45.761]  I'm not being unreasonable.
[00:31:46.381 --> 00:31:50.144]  Come out, come out wherever you are and talk to the press.
[00:31:53.226 --> 00:31:56.127]  Well, let's hear a little bit from Kamala herself.
[00:31:56.788 --> 00:31:57.368]  Here she is.
[00:31:58.409 --> 00:32:07.055]  On a different front, Axios this week reported that President Trump, if he gets a second term, will sort of dial back, for lack of a better term, DEI programs that the Biden administration has put in forth.
[00:32:07.195 --> 00:32:08.776]  Obviously, I know you disagree with that.
[00:32:08.916 --> 00:32:10.917]  I obviously believe that you don't want him to get a second term.
[00:32:11.077 --> 00:32:15.020]  That said, if that does happen, what do you think that would do to race relations in this country?
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.942]  Well, let me say, we're going to win, so it's not going to happen.
[00:32:20.343 --> 00:32:29.791]  But I think that, listen, today is actually, I believe, an anniversary in terms of Dr. King, right?
[00:32:30.251 --> 00:32:38.258]  And I was just in Selma, and we celebrated, well, acknowledged the 59th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.
[00:32:39.439 --> 00:32:44.122]  I think it's really important that we as Americans always embrace our history.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:50.365]  The parts that we're proud of and the parts that we're not proud of but that we can't forget.
[00:32:53.467 --> 00:33:04.571]  We should all agree that we should teach history, we should learn history, if we're to ever have an accurate idea of where we want to go and where we don't want to go in the future.
[00:33:05.631 --> 00:33:09.433]  And that means also acknowledging the importance of diversity.
[00:33:09.633 --> 00:33:17.816]  It means acknowledging the importance of the fact that everyone should have equal opportunity to compete and equity.
[00:33:18.576 --> 00:33:19.800]  And then, of course, inclusion.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:25.137]  That, you know, hey, let's look around the room and see who's not here and did we leave the door open?
[00:33:27.071 --> 00:33:29.473]  She is on drugs and drunk in that clip.
[00:33:29.493 --> 00:33:35.578]  But I've got a clip even worse, obviously, of her bumbling and babbling and saying things that make absolutely no sense.
[00:33:36.298 --> 00:33:38.740]  And it's not like we're cherry-picking these.
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:51.050]  You can watch any live event she's done where she does any substantive talking and she sounds stupider than Joe Biden in his deep dementia-riddled brain.
[00:33:52.378 --> 00:33:54.579]  So again, why did they select her?
[00:33:54.599 --> 00:33:56.280]  Because she's the perfect puppet.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.782]  She will do whatever she's told and remember none of it a week later.
[00:34:00.142 --> 00:34:03.003]  Remember, she says two-thirds of Americans died during COVID.
[00:34:04.164 --> 00:34:05.004]  Not even a million died.
[00:34:06.085 --> 00:34:07.886]  Two-thirds!
[00:34:07.906 --> 00:34:09.786]  220 million people died!
[00:34:10.627 --> 00:34:11.947]  And it's not like she says it in one speech.
[00:34:12.188 --> 00:34:13.228]  She said it in a bunch of speeches.
[00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.910]  Here she is.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.781]  Who doesn't love a yellow school bus, right?
[00:34:20.982 --> 00:34:24.063]  Can you raise your hand if you love a yellow school bus, right?
[00:34:24.663 --> 00:34:32.287]  Just, there's something about the, and most of us, many of us went to school on the yellow school bus, right?
[00:34:32.688 --> 00:34:33.888]  Space is exciting.
[00:34:33.908 --> 00:34:37.850]  It spurs our imaginations.
[00:34:38.791 --> 00:34:42.913]  And it forces us to ask big questions.
[00:34:44.214 --> 00:34:46.375]  Space, it affects us all.
[00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:49.655]  And it connects us all.
[00:34:52.504 --> 00:34:54.449]  You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?
[00:34:56.104 --> 00:35:01.286]  When we talk about the children of the community, they are the children of the community.
[00:35:01.486 --> 00:35:04.047]  I'm talking about the significance of the passage of time.
[00:35:05.088 --> 00:35:05.368]  Right?
[00:35:05.428 --> 00:35:07.629]  The significance of the passage of time.
[00:35:08.289 --> 00:35:12.290]  So when you think about it, there is great significance to the passage of time.
[00:35:13.071 --> 00:35:19.353]  And, um, we gotta take this stuff seriously, as seriously as you are because you have been forced to have to take it seriously.
[00:35:19.373 --> 00:35:23.395]  A mother who pays a coyote
[00:35:24.827 --> 00:35:33.729]  To transport her child through their country of origin, through the entire country of Mexico, facing unknown peril, to come here.
[00:35:34.149 --> 00:35:35.650]  Why would that mother do that?
[00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:36.690]  I will tell you.
[00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:41.871]  Because she has decided for that child to remain where they are is worse.
[00:35:42.251 --> 00:35:43.992]  But what does Donald Trump do?
[00:35:44.012 --> 00:35:47.313]  He says, go back to where you came from.
[00:35:47.533 --> 00:35:51.514]  That is not reflective of our America and our values and it's gotta end.
[00:35:52.096 --> 00:36:00.958]  Let's be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border.
[00:36:02.338 --> 00:36:02.979]  Do not come.
[00:36:05.339 --> 00:36:05.879]  Do not come.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.461]  And I believe if you come to our border, you will be turned back.
[00:36:12.981 --> 00:36:14.101]  She is beyond moronic.
[00:36:14.121 --> 00:36:15.202]  How do they find this lunatic?
[00:36:15.222 --> 00:36:18.122]  All right, let's get into the serious stuff now.
[00:36:18.222 --> 00:36:20.623]  This is obviously broke last night.
[00:36:21.758 --> 00:36:24.139]  Jack Smith indicts Trump again in D.C.
[00:36:24.199 --> 00:36:26.799]  following Supreme Court presidential immunity ruling.
[00:36:27.379 --> 00:36:28.099]  I've read the ruling.
[00:36:28.139 --> 00:36:29.020]  I've talked to lawyers.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.580]  My first take on it was accurate.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.040]  I put a report out last night.
[00:36:33.641 --> 00:36:35.061]  This is double jeopardy, basically.
[00:36:35.941 --> 00:36:42.063]  Now, you can argue that it's not, and that's what they're going to try to do, but the Supreme Court should shoot this down as well.
[00:36:43.603 --> 00:36:48.084]  They indicted Trump for questioning the election, which is his right as a president or a citizen.
[00:36:49.656 --> 00:36:52.279]  He was never convicted or indicted for anything on January 6th.
[00:36:52.339 --> 00:36:53.800]  They tried to take him off the ballot for that.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.841]  That was pure fraud.
[00:36:56.342 --> 00:37:00.426]  The Supreme Court said they would strike it down, so those states removed it.
[00:37:01.387 --> 00:37:03.289]  Maine and Colorado and a couple others.
[00:37:06.072 --> 00:37:10.336]  And now he has refiled it, but they're saying it's more limited.
[00:37:11.437 --> 00:37:12.538]  And I have the indictment, I'll show you.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:26.030]  To him, quote, questioning the election integrity, and they say that wasn't a presidential duty when he was still president and Biden was president-elect on paper.
[00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:27.431]  Congress hadn't certified it yet.
[00:37:28.111 --> 00:37:29.252]  So, total fraud.
[00:37:29.853 --> 00:37:31.734]  Jack Smith indicts Trump again in D.C.
[00:37:31.774 --> 00:37:33.916]  following Supreme Court presidential immunity ruling.
[00:37:35.097 --> 00:37:42.743]  Trump slams deranged special counsel Jack Smith's desperate indictment as unprecedented election interference, the greatest sabotage in our history of the election.
[00:37:44.206 --> 00:37:48.429]  Special Counsel Files Reworked Indictment Against Donald Trump, January 6th Case.
[00:37:48.849 --> 00:37:56.554]  Prosecutors have not dropped any of the four charges they had initially brought against the former president of the Supreme Court, and the judges strike that down completely if they don't remove it.
[00:37:56.995 --> 00:38:10.003]  However, the newly retooled indictment has carved out some of Trump's alleged conduct, including allegations about the attempts to use the Justice Department to promote his false claims of election fraud.
[00:38:10.624 --> 00:38:13.666]  My goodness, he asked the Justice Department to investigate and they refused.
[00:38:14.446 --> 00:38:28.895]  William Barr, but then meanwhile you see the current Justice Department running around indicting people and threatening to indict people, as well as state attorney generals indicting people in Arizona, Michigan, you name it, Georgia, for investigating.
[00:38:30.696 --> 00:38:35.819]  And here's the actual indictment filed in the District of Criminals, Washington D.C.
[00:38:38.381 --> 00:38:42.083]  So, let's start getting into the election meddling news on other fronts.
[00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:44.251]  The fix is in.
[00:38:44.511 --> 00:38:56.601]  Michigan Dems SOS makes threatening video warning election officials not to question the next cheat if you don't certify the election results will come for you.
[00:38:56.641 --> 00:39:07.991]  So they've got the Soros appointed Attorney General and then other local prosecutors, and this is an excellent Gateway Pundit article, it's long, with a whole bunch of statements and clips of them
[00:39:10.618 --> 00:39:19.425]  Threatening the children, and we've had to bleep this out, but that they're going to kill the children, hurt the children, and they're cussing.
[00:39:21.066 --> 00:39:22.748]  This is state reps saying this as well.
[00:39:23.648 --> 00:39:30.033]  If you question things on election night when they cover the windows up and have trucks drive in when everything's supposedly not counting and they're still counting.
[00:39:31.064 --> 00:39:33.605]  I've been to the main election center in Detroit where they did this.
[00:39:34.185 --> 00:39:35.605]  TPUSA had an event there.
[00:39:36.045 --> 00:39:40.566]  It's a convention center and it's just incredible to actually be where the election was stolen.
[00:39:42.227 --> 00:39:52.949]  So I've got a clip here of a representative making these threats, also posted on X and on Infowars.com.
[00:39:52.969 --> 00:39:55.890]  This is Democrat state representative-elect Abraham
[00:39:57.043 --> 00:40:02.186]  Ayesha threatens the children of Wayne County Board of Canvassers member, Monica Palmer.
[00:40:02.206 --> 00:40:02.666]  Here it is.
[00:40:03.827 --> 00:40:06.209]  And what that tells us is you, Ms.
[00:40:06.249 --> 00:40:17.876]  Monica Palmer, from growing up in Columbus, which has a history of racism, are deciding to enable and continue to perpetuate the racist history of this country.
[00:40:19.156 --> 00:40:23.199]  And I want you to think about what that means for your kids, who are probably going to grow
[00:40:25.239 --> 00:40:31.383]  And when they see all their black classmates and they know... Unbelievable.
[00:40:32.863 --> 00:40:37.146]  Those black classmates, the full clips on InfoWars.com, know that you're a racist white person.
[00:40:37.946 --> 00:40:39.347]  So he's basically threatening race war.
[00:40:41.929 --> 00:40:44.850]  Michigan senator obliterates Soros-backed SOS.
[00:40:47.072 --> 00:40:50.293]  Jacqueline Benson after she loses 8th election-related lawsuit.
[00:40:51.514 --> 00:40:52.635]  So, everywhere,
[00:40:54.383 --> 00:40:58.986]  The establishment's being caught red-handed in how they stole the 2020 election in Michigan.
[00:40:59.006 --> 00:41:03.508]  Big article, huge article, very lengthy, going over all the details at GatewayPundit.com.
[00:41:04.048 --> 00:41:12.813]  Texas AG Ken Paxson launches election fraud raids on Latino Democrats' homes, including state, House candidate, and local mayoral offices.
[00:41:13.013 --> 00:41:16.175]  Officers seize 65 cell phones and 41 computers.
[00:41:16.215 --> 00:41:18.957]  So these are illegal alien processing centers.
[00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:26.211]  Where they have the Democrat Party, the lawyers, the social workers, they all get a cut of the welfare money and the jobs they make them get.
[00:41:26.291 --> 00:41:28.412]  If they don't pay the money into them, they're then deported.
[00:41:30.012 --> 00:41:32.732]  They have total control, slavery, over this permanent underclass.
[00:41:33.433 --> 00:41:34.253]  This is a big deal.
[00:41:34.653 --> 00:41:45.955]  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has ramped up efforts to ensure the integrity of state elections, including a comprehensive investigation into allegations that non-profit organizations are unlawfully registering non-citizens to vote.
[00:41:46.812 --> 00:41:49.213]  And then they do major polls in many states.
[00:41:49.253 --> 00:41:51.955]  Up to 14% of the voters are illegal aliens in the Democratic Party.
[00:41:52.796 --> 00:41:59.900]  This push aims to preserve the sanctity of the electoral process and prevent any potential legal interference in local, state, or national elections.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.441]  This is real leadership.
[00:42:01.461 --> 00:42:03.562]  That's why they tried to put Paxson in prison three times.
[00:42:04.102 --> 00:42:15.229]  Investigators from the Texas Attorney General's Election Integrity Unit, as well as the Governor's Office, have been conducting undercover operations to identify and crack down on voter registration activities that may involve non-citizens.
[00:42:16.792 --> 00:42:20.093]  And you've seen James O'Keefe go out and expose this in Texas in the last few months.
[00:42:20.873 --> 00:42:26.575]  This is the same unit that in June 2021 arrested Monica Menendez in Victoria County on multiple counts of election fraud.
[00:42:27.016 --> 00:42:35.398]  Menendez was charged with seven counts of illegal voting, eight counts of unlawful assisting a voter by mail, eight counts of unlawful possession of ballot, and eight counts of election fraud.
[00:42:36.319 --> 00:42:42.761]  And of course last week, there were big raids in Houston on Democrat Party election officials who were caught
[00:42:43.789 --> 00:42:49.856]  Reportedly, allegedly, absconding with ballots and sabotaging Republican ballots in Republican precincts.
[00:42:51.658 --> 00:42:55.462]  In a statement on Wednesday, Attorney General Paxson expressed deep concern over these findings.
[00:42:56.223 --> 00:42:56.963]  And he goes over it.
[00:42:57.623 --> 00:43:09.287]  Early findings from those recent operations have revealed the various non-profit organizations, the NGOs, have been setting up booths outside Texas Department of Public Safety driver's license offices offering voter registration assistance to the illegal aliens.
[00:43:09.907 --> 00:43:13.268]  They're targeting non-citizens right in front of the state police.
[00:43:13.649 --> 00:43:17.450]  It's like driving in a 40 past the state trooper at 120.
[00:43:20.555 --> 00:43:24.016]  There's a copy of the wide-ranging search warrant left with one of the people targeted.
[00:43:24.616 --> 00:43:29.638]  LULAC volunteer Linda Martinez, 87, of San Antonio, offered a window into the investigation's interest.
[00:43:29.958 --> 00:43:40.782]  The warrant ordered the seizure of all electronic devices at her home, allowed for the opening of documents that were business, organization, and election-related, and authorized swabbing of DNA, according to the warrant.
[00:43:41.082 --> 00:43:46.743]  The purpose of the search was to look for evidence of violations of the Texas election laws regarding vote harvesting and entity fraud.
[00:43:47.264 --> 00:43:47.824]  Yes!
[00:43:48.744 --> 00:43:50.925]  Yes, Ken Paxton, yes!
[00:43:51.785 --> 00:43:55.027]  Yes, Governor Abbott has gotten out of the way on this.
[00:43:55.687 --> 00:43:59.389]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
[00:44:01.089 --> 00:44:06.932]  And man, Ken Paxton... I've been on the air with him before and talked to him, really nice guy.
[00:44:07.352 --> 00:44:10.233]  He's been persecuted for seven years being a good guy in government.
[00:44:11.274 --> 00:44:16.116]  And he may not be the most exciting speaker, but boy, he's got the big elephant balls.
[00:44:18.561 --> 00:44:24.042]  Melinda's home was also forcibly entered in the early morning of August 20th, according to filing from the attorney.
[00:44:24.102 --> 00:44:28.343]  Officers woke up Melinda, his wife and two young daughters, and rummaged through the residence.
[00:44:28.723 --> 00:44:34.544]  For several hours, the attorney said, searching through the living space, closet, kitchen, bathrooms, garage, and family bedroom.
[00:44:34.604 --> 00:44:38.704]  Officers seized 65 cell phones, computers, and storage devices.
[00:44:39.225 --> 00:44:44.966]  The filing said... And it just goes on from there.
[00:44:45.686 --> 00:44:46.966]  And of course, with this, they'll have
[00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:51.091]  A roadmap into the rest of the operations.
[00:44:51.151 --> 00:44:54.593]  And look, you can't swing a stick and not find this here in Texas.
[00:44:55.674 --> 00:44:57.255]  Can't swing a stick in the dark and not find it.
[00:44:59.316 --> 00:45:00.777]  That is some good news.
[00:45:00.837 --> 00:45:02.358]  Look at this.
[00:45:02.538 --> 00:45:06.220]  1.1 million ineligible voters removed from Texas voter rolls in the last two days.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:07.801]  And they're not done yet.
[00:45:08.721 --> 00:45:12.103]  Including a half a million that were dead people or illegal aliens.
[00:45:12.864 --> 00:45:14.064]  That's KXAN.
[00:45:14.084 --> 00:45:15.005]  You want to see the newscast?
[00:45:17.418 --> 00:45:17.798]  You know what?
[00:45:17.878 --> 00:45:19.900]  I don't have time to play the newscast, but I'll get to it later.
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.842]  But we're going to air that KXAN newscast.
[00:45:21.882 --> 00:45:24.924]  Here's a gov.texas.gov.
[00:45:25.845 --> 00:45:29.148]  Governor Abbott announces over 1 million ineligible voters removed from voter rolls.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:33.081]  And it continues with election meddling with the Democrats.
[00:45:33.702 --> 00:45:34.522]  And now we're exposing it.
[00:45:34.882 --> 00:45:35.422]  Election theft.
[00:45:35.803 --> 00:45:36.843]  Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:45:36.863 --> 00:45:42.966]  will stay on Wisconsin ballot, as well as Michigan, after election commission defies his own request for removal.
[00:45:43.346 --> 00:45:50.970]  So they try to take Trump illegally off the ballot, and then because Kennedy wants off in the battlegrounds to make Trump guaranteed win, they're like, no, you stay on the ballot.
[00:45:52.111 --> 00:45:56.553]  Now, to their credit, but Nevada's so razor thin they think it might actually help the Democrats.
[00:45:57.441 --> 00:46:00.382]  They are taking him off the ballot in Nevada.
[00:46:02.123 --> 00:46:04.424]  Pennsylvania, Georgia, other states are still to be seen.
[00:46:04.464 --> 00:46:05.225]  He's trying to get off there.
[00:46:07.446 --> 00:46:13.789]  Leftist Justice Brown Jackson says she is prepared to rule on disrupted presidential election.
[00:46:14.589 --> 00:46:15.749]  The others aren't saying what they'll do.
[00:46:22.012 --> 00:46:22.973]  You can't make this up.
[00:46:24.315 --> 00:46:31.817]  Public-private partnerships, government and private groups still collude to, quote, target misinformation, which when they call it misinformation, you know it's probably true.
[00:46:33.437 --> 00:46:37.978]  Democrats' Senatorial Campaign Committee laments big decline in tech collaborations in 2016.
[00:46:38.599 --> 00:46:41.579]  That's right, big tech's trying to stay out of it or joining Trump.
[00:46:41.959 --> 00:46:48.801]  Not the biggest companies, they're just sitting on the sidelines and giving secret support to Democrats, but more and more of the medium-sized and small companies aren't.
[00:46:50.622 --> 00:46:51.482]  House Dems pressure
[00:46:52.642 --> 00:47:00.084]  Federal Election Commission to censor Grox, that's Elon's AI art generator before election, critical for democracy.
[00:47:00.124 --> 00:47:06.546]  They say they're trying to pass laws to make it illegal to use AI to put horns on Kamala in front of a hammer and sickle.
[00:47:08.266 --> 00:47:10.366]  Anybody looking at that knows it's a joke.
[00:47:10.466 --> 00:47:13.947]  Anybody looking at that know, oh look, they're nice to Trump and they're mean to her.
[00:47:14.007 --> 00:47:16.808]  Well go use it and create stuff that's anti-Trump, dumbos.
[00:47:17.908 --> 00:47:20.149]  Free speech means political speech is the most protected.
[00:47:21.161 --> 00:47:30.051]  Meanwhile, to illustrate how the Communist Chinese are involved worldwide trying to subvert our countries, Chinese agents reportedly use illegal tactics to threaten Canadians.
[00:47:30.071 --> 00:47:32.074]  2021 election documents show.
[00:47:33.415 --> 00:47:35.598]  Yep, Chinese folks that are...
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:47.644]  Canadian citizens, they're being harassed by the CCP, and you've got Trudeau basically in a lip lock with the CCP and saying he admires most Xi Jinping's dictatorship.
[00:47:48.364 --> 00:47:49.525]  Would you like to see the clip?
[00:47:49.545 --> 00:47:50.925]  I probably played it 500 times.
[00:47:51.325 --> 00:47:52.386]  That doesn't sound true.
[00:47:52.446 --> 00:47:57.668]  Like, Trudeau endorsed and said the thing he admires the most is Xi Jinping's basic dictatorship.
[00:47:57.748 --> 00:47:58.068]  That's a quote.
[00:47:58.108 --> 00:47:59.468]  I'm not going to play it again.
[00:47:59.908 --> 00:48:01.449]  If people are lazy, you don't want to look it up, that's fine.
[00:48:02.209 --> 00:48:02.509]  It's real.
[00:48:02.529 --> 00:48:03.670]  I just want to say,
[00:48:06.118 --> 00:48:07.138]  Good job, Texas.
[00:48:08.299 --> 00:48:14.921]  I am very, very excited for what Ken Pax is doing, so I tip my hat to you.
[00:48:15.381 --> 00:48:15.821]  Good sir.
[00:48:16.982 --> 00:48:22.144]  And boy, they're already trying to indict him again, but we're in a war for the Republic.
[00:48:22.184 --> 00:48:26.225]  That's what comes with being a soldier of truth in the fight for the future.
[00:48:27.946 --> 00:48:28.246]  All right.
[00:48:29.526 --> 00:48:32.467]  That is a lot of information, isn't it?
[00:48:32.567 --> 00:48:34.848]  And I've actually got a whole nother stack
[00:48:36.903 --> 00:48:39.624]  On election meddling by the Democratic Party and attempted election theft.
[00:48:41.025 --> 00:48:42.206]  But the tide has turned.
[00:48:42.966 --> 00:48:44.707]  So let me hit this last point.
[00:48:45.367 --> 00:48:47.989]  I'm gonna go to break and come back with the next hour.
[00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:50.210]  And all the other news.
[00:48:53.372 --> 00:49:00.796]  Wait till you hear what transgender athlete who competed in male division recently did at a Paralympics.
[00:49:01.796 --> 00:49:04.678]  Oh, if they can, men can compete against girls.
[00:49:07.358 --> 00:49:09.778]  How about saying you're handicapped when you're not?
[00:49:10.618 --> 00:49:16.260]  All right, we're going to be talking about that and more coming up now.
[00:49:18.141 --> 00:49:28.784]  CNN, Washington Post, New York Times, without even looking for these articles, so I'm sure there's more, but those are key mouthpieces, have all come out and
[00:49:30.305 --> 00:49:35.666]  When the rulers never say a bad thing about the Democrat Party nominee who was installed.
[00:49:36.646 --> 00:49:45.669]  And they have said that she is weak, phony, ignorant, shallow, which of course is an understatement.
[00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:54.431]  And to me, the question isn't the statement is true.
[00:49:54.631 --> 00:49:56.051]  Why are they doing that?
[00:49:58.032 --> 00:50:03.175]  Well, I'm going to talk about that when we start the next hour, because that is the $64 trillion answer.
[00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:11.539]  And I'm not sure, but I've got a good idea why they're doing that.
[00:50:11.839 --> 00:50:13.200]  It's not to look fair and balanced.
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:14.760]  They've already lost most of their audiences.
[00:50:15.801 --> 00:50:16.061]  No.
[00:50:17.302 --> 00:50:22.624]  There's a couple different scenarios here that I'm going to talk about next hour.
[00:50:23.385 --> 00:50:26.546]  And they've already installed Biden, then removed Biden, installed her.
[00:50:26.566 --> 00:50:27.687]  They already tried to kill Trump.
[00:50:29.252 --> 00:50:40.596]  I've talked to a lot of really smart people that I thought were probably just trolling, Trump has done it, others have said it, that they may still remove Kamala and install somebody soon.
[00:50:40.616 --> 00:50:43.917]  And you're like, that sounds outrageous.
[00:50:44.258 --> 00:50:47.419]  Yeah, with only 60-something days of the election, they'll do anything.
[00:50:48.839 --> 00:50:50.260]  But that's probably not it.
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:57.923]  That's either that, or they know Trump is unstoppable, and then we should talk about what they're gonna do once he gets in.
[00:50:59.187 --> 00:51:03.328]  And get ahead of that, and now they're gonna try to sabotage the Trump administration.
[00:51:03.689 --> 00:51:06.590]  But that's why the deep state's panicking, because bringing in RFK Jr.
[00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:15.252]  that knows he's really smart about everything, and all these Tulsi Gabbards, all these people can help him fill his government with patriots.
[00:51:15.312 --> 00:51:20.634]  And we won't listen too much to RFK, we'll make sure they're not leftists, but people that actually go after the corrupt globalists.
[00:51:21.174 --> 00:51:26.116]  But he's gonna have a lot of great people that are super conservative and nationalist in there as well.
[00:51:26.196 --> 00:51:28.457]  So let's just say this, the establishment is not pleased.
[00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:33.474]  So I'm gonna get more into that next hour, but I kind of gave away my view on that, but I'll elaborate.
[00:51:33.554 --> 00:51:40.142]  Now, before we go to break, remember, we have incredible products that will enrich your life, empower you, that are amazing, that you just need to believe me.

[00:52:17.199 --> 00:52:17.959]  That great product.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:23.081]  Nitric Boost, part of the InfoWarsMD line at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:53:04.071 --> 00:53:06.212]  DrJonesNaturals.com.
[00:53:06.552 --> 00:53:07.673]  Without you, we fail.
[00:53:07.713 --> 00:53:09.773]  With your support, we win together.
[00:53:09.793 --> 00:53:11.794]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:53:12.154 --> 00:53:17.917]  COVID vax causes more heart damage than COVID virus and brain, blood, immune cancer, reproductive study.
[00:53:18.257 --> 00:53:19.177]  I mean, there's so many studies.
[00:53:19.197 --> 00:53:19.737]  What do you make of that?
[00:53:19.777 --> 00:53:21.878]  This finally settled the question, Alex.
[00:53:22.178 --> 00:53:27.961]  The COVID vaccine causes myocarditis in young people, not the infection.
[00:53:28.341 --> 00:53:29.841]  It's a government false narrative.
[00:53:29.881 --> 00:53:33.163]  It's been propagated through the American College of Cardiology and other agencies.
[00:53:33.783 --> 00:53:35.745]  That the infection causes myocarditis.
[00:53:35.945 --> 00:53:36.626]  It doesn't.
[00:53:36.846 --> 00:53:38.849]  Looking at this, then, we see these headlines constantly.
[00:53:38.869 --> 00:53:40.771]  When you follow the article, there's no link, there's no proof.
[00:53:40.811 --> 00:53:46.437]  It just says, COVID'S A GREATER RISK OF HEART PROBLEMS THAN THE SHOT, and they just lie.
[00:53:46.837 --> 00:53:52.803]  It's a, essentially, it's a giant medical lie perpetrated by the American College of Cardiology, the CDC.
[00:53:53.684 --> 00:53:57.246]  The NIH, this is a false narrative.
[00:53:57.606 --> 00:54:01.108]  No confirmed cases by adjudication or autopsy.
[00:54:01.148 --> 00:54:02.248]  No hospitalizations and deaths.
[00:54:02.529 --> 00:54:09.512]  But the vaccine, we are, I'm a cardiologist Alex, I am knee deep in people with vaccine myocarditis causing heart failure.
[00:54:09.752 --> 00:54:16.776]  The vaccines do cause heart arrhythmias, insomnias, inflammation in the heart, atrial fibrillation, sometimes ventricular arrhythmias.
[00:54:17.336 --> 00:54:19.237]  COVID shots can enlarge and weaken the heart.
[00:54:19.277 --> 00:54:19.837]  Another study.
[00:54:20.238 --> 00:54:25.781]  Heart failure can be an outcome of subclinical myocarditis.
[00:54:25.861 --> 00:54:36.347]  It's very important for people to realize they may not feel chest pain initially, but then they have the onset of effort intolerance, pulmonary edema, congestion, and leg swelling.
[00:54:36.407 --> 00:54:39.328]  I have cases from Austin, Alex, referred up to my office.
[00:54:39.649 --> 00:54:41.890]  It's vaccine, myocarditis, and heart failure.
[00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:43.511]  They need treatment for this.
[00:54:43.851 --> 00:54:51.696]  The go-to is McCullough Protocol Base Spike Protein Detoxification with supplements available through OnlineHealthNow.com.
[00:54:51.937 --> 00:54:53.077]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
[00:54:53.137 --> 00:55:02.303]  We have ample data now suggesting every cancer is increasing worldwide in virtually every organ system, and it's related to COVID-19 vaccines.
[00:55:02.464 --> 00:55:11.530]  Now, I'm glad, Dr. McCullough, that you brought up how to detox, either whether you got COVID in the wild, which you know is a lot less from the studies, as bad as taking the shots,
[00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:20.999]  But if you want to detox from it, you're one of the top research doctors out there, one of the, if not the most published.
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:29.188]  You have actually developed something, come up with something available at onlinehealthnow.com that you're saying is the go-to here.
[00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:32.712]  Spend a few minutes telling us about that anti-spike protein protocol.
[00:55:33.012 --> 00:55:37.254]  It's the base of what we do now in long COVID and vaccine injury syndromes.
[00:55:37.414 --> 00:55:45.337]  It's caused because of accumulation of the spike protein from the infection and in a massive doses from the vaccine.
[00:55:45.657 --> 00:55:47.098]  It gets stuck in the human body.
[00:55:47.398 --> 00:55:50.900]  We need to assist the body in clearing the spike protein.
[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:56.662]  We have several years of observation, multiple peer-reviewed publications on this, very good support for doing this.
[00:55:57.102 --> 00:55:58.263]  It's natokinase.
[00:55:58.743 --> 00:56:01.905]  Which is a natural enzyme derived from the fermentation of soy.
[00:56:01.945 --> 00:56:03.025]  Japanese discovered it.
[00:56:03.625 --> 00:56:07.227]  Bromelain, a family of enzymes derived from the stems of pineapple.
[00:56:07.667 --> 00:56:11.229]  And then lastly, curcumin derived from turmeric and Indian spice.
[00:56:11.249 --> 00:56:12.970]  These are all in capsule format.
[00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:15.751]  We give them in combination in between meals.
[00:56:16.071 --> 00:56:17.952]  And we're using accelerating doses.
[00:56:18.052 --> 00:56:20.994]  People are doing this across the world right now, Alex.
[00:56:21.334 --> 00:56:22.055]  So you build up?
[00:56:22.395 --> 00:56:23.115]  And we build up.
[00:56:23.155 --> 00:56:27.078]  Now listen, the starting doses were 2,000 units twice a day of natto.
[00:56:27.118 --> 00:56:29.260]  We're now going to 4,000 twice a day.
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:34.984]  We do give them in addition to blood thinners, and we have found sometimes it's the only way to dissolve the blood clots.
[00:56:35.244 --> 00:56:38.967]  When people get large vaccine blood clots, the blood thinners just hold it steady.
[00:56:39.167 --> 00:56:40.168]  They don't dissolve them.
[00:56:40.428 --> 00:56:46.373]  We actually have to give rhombolytic enzymes, that's McCullough protocol, base spike protein detoxification.
[00:56:46.753 --> 00:56:50.616]  And people can find out all the details of that at OnlineHealthNow.com.
[00:56:50.936 --> 00:56:52.017]  That's the go-to place.
[00:56:52.037 --> 00:56:57.340]  The wellness company provides, you know, really the leading quality and the leading formulation.
[00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:00.963]  So the spike formulation has not only natal kinase, but five minor ingredients.
[00:57:01.183 --> 00:57:08.448]  We combine that with the curcumin and the bromelain for what we think is the ultimate spike detox trio.
[00:57:08.828 --> 00:57:10.349]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
[00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:13.888]  All right, we're back into hour number two.
[00:57:13.908 --> 00:57:16.489]  I want to hit in this short segment a really important story.
[00:57:16.509 --> 00:57:23.551]  I mean, in and of itself, it's just ridiculous, but it's a tactic the deep state globalists are using.
[00:57:24.291 --> 00:57:37.214]  So, last night, Kamala Harris' official ex-presidential candidate installed by the deep state Twitter account, ex-account, put out a fake letter, supposedly from Tucker Carlson.
[00:57:38.576 --> 00:57:43.844]  And they said, oh, you know, Tucker, even though we disagree with you politically, thank you for agreeing we should ban guns.
[00:57:44.245 --> 00:57:45.467]  Cop escape semi-automatics.
[00:57:45.487 --> 00:57:47.350]  And I'll show you an overhead shot of the letter.
[00:57:48.972 --> 00:57:52.317]  And again, they don't say Tucker Carlson, but they're clearly saying it's Tucker Carlson.
[00:57:52.378 --> 00:57:52.958]  It's a fraud.
[00:57:54.158 --> 00:58:00.881]  And that's just like they do saying Taylor Swift and Beyonce are probably going to be at this tonight, but somebody special will be at the DNC.
[00:58:01.342 --> 00:58:08.485]  They did the same thing in Dearborn, Michigan three weeks ago, and I was the first to catch on to that because I saw people complaining, where is Taylor Swift?
[00:58:08.525 --> 00:58:09.846]  I'm like, she's in Europe, dummies.
[00:58:10.766 --> 00:58:15.789]  But they're looking for the constituents they can con, so they put this letter out that even Tucker Carlson supports banning guns.
[00:58:18.029 --> 00:58:18.929]  It's like the fake headlines.
[00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:20.910]  Alex Jones says in court he's an actor.
[00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:21.791]  Where's the clip?
[00:58:21.851 --> 00:58:22.411]  Where's the video?
[00:58:22.431 --> 00:58:23.151]  Where did I ever say that?
[00:58:23.612 --> 00:58:24.112]  That I'm fake?
[00:58:24.212 --> 00:58:24.632]  Never said it.
[00:58:24.652 --> 00:58:26.873]  They just... They said Tucker says he's an actor.
[00:58:27.273 --> 00:58:27.694]  Made up.
[00:58:28.554 --> 00:58:28.974]  Remember that?
[00:58:29.735 --> 00:58:30.615]  Story from years ago.
[00:58:31.175 --> 00:58:33.897]  So Tucker trolled her back very quickly this morning.
[00:58:34.737 --> 00:58:36.518]  A letter from a fan, Tucker Carlson said.
[00:58:37.979 --> 00:58:39.419]  And it's signed Kamala.
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:42.341]  And he says, Dear Tucker,
[00:58:43.283 --> 00:58:50.314]  Dear Tucker, I can't believe I'm writing you this, and it's written like an eight-year-old girl wrote it, little hearts and stuff.
[00:58:50.955 --> 00:58:56.804]  I can't believe I'm, or maybe a ten-year-old girl, you know, remember we got these love letters in middle school, little hearts on them.
[00:58:58.137 --> 00:59:02.499]  Dear Tucker, I can't believe I'm writing you this letter, but here goes.
[00:59:02.919 --> 00:59:07.021]  Honestly, I never thought we had all that much in common since college.
[00:59:07.481 --> 00:59:17.445]  I've considered myself moderately progressive in the sense that I don't believe in law enforcement, national borders, or the right of American citizens to exercise fundamental human autonomy.
[00:59:17.865 --> 00:59:20.906]  You seem like you were coming from a totally different place.
[00:59:21.746 --> 00:59:23.827]  I thought I disagreed with you on everything.
[00:59:24.187 --> 00:59:25.208]  Boy, was I wrong.
[00:59:25.908 --> 00:59:30.751]  The other night I was looking at the internet and saw your conversation with Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[00:59:31.172 --> 00:59:33.593]  There wasn't a word I disagreed with, not one.
[00:59:34.374 --> 00:59:39.417]  I turned to Montel and said, I was very wrong about this man.
[00:59:39.837 --> 00:59:40.818]  So, so very wrong.
[00:59:41.358 --> 00:59:44.841]  The way he talks, he's so bold and wise and strong.
[00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:48.523]  He's immovable, like a towering oak tree in a windstorm.
[00:59:48.883 --> 00:59:51.525]  He sways gently, never breaks his trunk.
[00:59:52.226 --> 00:59:55.188]  It's so broad and firm and rooted in the earth.
[00:59:56.188 --> 00:59:59.070]  I can't imagine the size of his root ball.
[01:00:00.571 --> 01:00:01.372]  God, they wrote this.
[01:00:01.732 --> 01:00:02.352]  Probably Tucker.
[01:00:02.772 --> 01:00:03.973]  I was so impressed.
[01:00:04.574 --> 01:00:05.534]  Or Lexi or somebody.
[01:00:06.115 --> 01:00:06.935]  So thank you.
[01:00:08.076 --> 01:00:12.659]  You've shown me something about myself, if and about the world.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.281]  I will never forget it until we meet.
[01:00:16.881 --> 01:00:18.202]  OXOXO.
[01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:20.844]  Heart with a little
[01:00:22.176 --> 01:00:23.738]  Arrow through it in a smiley face.
[01:00:23.978 --> 01:00:26.020]  Isn't that just sweet?
[01:00:26.941 --> 01:00:29.404]  Kamala Harris wrote that to Tucker.
[01:00:30.004 --> 01:00:32.147]  Now, of course, we're admitting it's a joke.
[01:00:32.187 --> 01:00:33.608]  We're admitting it's satire.
[01:00:34.009 --> 01:00:34.869]  They didn't do that.
[01:00:35.770 --> 01:00:39.955]  They tried to deceive people because it's all they've got.
[01:00:41.757 --> 01:00:44.580]  Oh, there they are in Michigan to see her arrive!
[01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:50.792]  And they stuck the whole crowd on the tarmac to make it look big, using deception.
[01:00:50.812 --> 01:00:53.215]  But it was still, you know, 10,000 people at least.
[01:00:54.436 --> 01:00:55.197]  Normally, she gets like 100.
[01:00:56.018 --> 01:00:57.439]  Seriously, we've shown that.
[01:00:57.519 --> 01:00:58.720]  Most of them about 100 people, some like 50.
[01:01:00.102 --> 01:01:02.904]  But, they told him Taylor Swift was gonna be there.
[01:01:03.965 --> 01:01:05.427]  And they came boiling out.
[01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:08.610]  Also, a bunch of unions ordered them to be there.
[01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:10.412]  So, caught red-handed.
[01:01:13.877 --> 01:01:15.377]  I was just so wrong about this man.
[01:01:15.417 --> 01:01:16.278]  So, so very wrong.
[01:01:16.298 --> 01:01:17.898]  The way he talks, he's so bold.
[01:01:18.218 --> 01:01:19.078]  And why is it strong?
[01:01:19.098 --> 01:01:22.579]  He's immovable like a towering oak in the windstorm.
[01:01:22.959 --> 01:01:26.060]  He sways gently, but never breaks.
[01:01:27.261 --> 01:01:29.961]  His trunk is so broad and firm and rooted in the earth.
[01:01:30.361 --> 01:01:32.362]  I can't imagine the size of his root ball.
[01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:34.943]  I was so impressed.
[01:01:35.543 --> 01:01:36.223]  So, thank you.
[01:01:37.063 --> 01:01:40.304]  You've shown me something about myself and about the world.
[01:01:40.324 --> 01:01:42.925]  I will never forget it until we meet, Kamala.
[01:01:45.387 --> 01:01:46.468]  That's why I love Tucker.
[01:01:47.268 --> 01:01:48.489]  So ridiculous.
[01:01:49.930 --> 01:02:00.856]  Yeah, Tucker, when I go and speak to a giant crowd of probably 30-40,000 in Pennsylvania on the 23rd, he won't need any AI, and he won't need to say that Beyonce's gonna be there.
[01:02:01.437 --> 01:02:02.137]  We're gonna be there.
[01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:02.857]  You're gonna be there.
[01:02:02.897 --> 01:02:03.358]  Stay with us.
[01:02:04.038 --> 01:02:07.780]  All right, we've got a jam-packed second, third, and fourth hour today.
[01:02:08.361 --> 01:02:09.982]  Daniel Esselstyn with huge breaking news.
[01:02:11.264 --> 01:02:18.469]  On the wars, on the election, on the arrest, and now they're getting ready to charge him of the founder of Telegram.
[01:02:18.529 --> 01:02:19.991]  It's actually bigger than Twitter globally.
[01:02:21.692 --> 01:02:22.412]  This is a big deal.
[01:02:23.613 --> 01:02:26.495]  And Macron lured him there, saying he wanted to have dinner with him.
[01:02:27.336 --> 01:02:27.916]  That's confirmed.
[01:02:28.036 --> 01:02:29.397]  The police said that.
[01:02:29.417 --> 01:02:30.298]  That's mainstream news.
[01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:32.500]  Steve Kersh, incredible tech
[01:02:33.672 --> 01:02:38.394]  Guru and Titan, an expert on the poison shots, all the huge developments he has been on about four months.
[01:02:38.914 --> 01:02:39.474]  That's gonna be big.
[01:02:39.694 --> 01:02:43.295]  Dr. Kirk Elliott pops in on some big economic developments as well.
[01:02:45.876 --> 01:03:02.141]  Now I want to get to the story I touched on at the end of the last hour, about why suddenly, and I'm seeing this a lot of places, it's a talking point, from mouthpieces like the New York Times, of the establishment, that Kamala is a disaster.
[01:03:04.585 --> 01:03:17.253]  For a month we've been told she's the second coming of Christ, and is the most eloquent, incredible orator, and super genius since Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci met Werner Von Braun.
[01:03:18.794 --> 01:03:20.174]  But that is not the case.
[01:03:20.194 --> 01:03:22.856]  So I'm gonna give you my take on that in a moment, but first I gotta get to this clip.
[01:03:23.556 --> 01:03:25.478]  Because R.L.K.
[01:03:25.518 --> 01:03:25.878]  Jr.
[01:03:25.978 --> 01:03:29.020]  nails it when he explains the carbon tax that
[01:03:29.833 --> 01:03:30.854]  Attacks what plants breathe.
[01:03:31.514 --> 01:03:34.015]  And carbon dioxide has been way higher in Earth's history.
[01:03:34.795 --> 01:03:37.057]  And it's good for all life.
[01:03:38.117 --> 01:03:39.958]  And they lied about it making sea levels rise.
[01:03:39.978 --> 01:03:41.619]  They haven't risen one millimeter.
[01:03:42.759 --> 01:03:44.440]  Just ask Obama and everybody behind him.
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:46.041]  No such property at one foot above sea level.
[01:03:46.061 --> 01:03:48.802]  Supposed to be all underwater by now.
[01:03:48.822 --> 01:03:49.983]  The ice cap's supposed to be melted.
[01:03:50.003 --> 01:03:51.904]  First it was 2009, then 2017, and now they say 2030.
[01:03:52.184 --> 01:03:52.644]  It's pure crap.
[01:03:57.776 --> 01:04:05.801]  But they distract from the GMOs, and the 5Gs, and the genetic engineering, and the chemtrailing, which he's now talking about, which is going on, it's government programs.
[01:04:06.101 --> 01:04:10.464]  There is no chemtrailing, because that's a layman's term, but there is geoengineering going on.
[01:04:11.025 --> 01:04:12.526]  And Bill Gates, the Department of Energy, run it.
[01:04:12.966 --> 01:04:18.690]  And it's quasi-secret, but even the CIA director, under Obama, gave a press conference and admitted they're doing it.
[01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:20.891]  That's poisoning everything with aluminum dioxide, barium salts.
[01:04:21.792 --> 01:04:24.754]  Someone played clip 5, Robert M. Kennedy Jr., the Democrats have become
[01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:30.491]  It's assumed in the carbon orthodoxy.
[01:04:30.531 --> 01:04:31.111]  It's a religion.
[01:04:31.832 --> 01:04:38.795]  But they don't care about the gender-bending chemicals, the endocrine disruptors, that on record make
[01:04:39.758 --> 01:04:45.903]  The frogs, depending on the study, upwards of 90% of them not want to have sex with females and start having sex with males.
[01:04:46.563 --> 01:04:48.564]  And then member David Hogg and others said, well, what's wrong with that?
[01:04:48.605 --> 01:04:49.325]  Gay frogs are great.
[01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:50.866]  Then there's no more frogs.
[01:04:51.707 --> 01:04:58.552]  Some species are almost extinct because of the allowable amount of atrazine in the water in studies by Berkeley and others.
[01:05:00.333 --> 01:05:01.234]  Sterilize them.
[01:05:01.714 --> 01:05:02.415]  Gender bend them.
[01:05:03.314 --> 01:05:18.158]  And in utero doesn't make a male fetus female but deadens the male attributes to the point of sometimes the boys have vaginas but they still have male chromosomes.
[01:05:19.839 --> 01:05:29.982]  So it is in the water and I don't hate people that feel like they're a girl because their mother got atrazine and other chemicals when they were pregnant in the first trimester.
[01:05:31.254 --> 01:05:33.498]  Particularly in the first few weeks, when the zygote's growing.
[01:05:35.482 --> 01:05:40.451]  And then a few weeks in, the sex starts manifesting.
[01:05:41.676 --> 01:05:44.037]  And so, I've talked about this for decades.
[01:05:44.057 --> 01:05:46.078]  They've had all the national news attacking me for it.
[01:05:46.719 --> 01:05:51.361]  But now, boy, is it mainstream, and the lawsuits are flowing, and that's good, because this is going to get turned around.
[01:05:51.641 --> 01:05:52.902]  There's lots of chemicals that don't do this.
[01:05:52.922 --> 01:05:56.464]  They chose strategically these chemicals in the U.S.
[01:05:56.524 --> 01:05:57.264]  It's been exported.
[01:05:57.604 --> 01:05:59.505]  Other countries banned it 30, 40 years ago.
[01:05:59.765 --> 01:06:00.666]  I'm just mentioning Atrazine.
[01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:02.127]  There's a bunch of these.
[01:06:02.527 --> 01:06:06.569]  And I've had top chemists on, Dr. Conant, so many over the years.
[01:06:08.018 --> 01:06:09.879]  Uh, to, uh, break this down.
[01:06:10.279 --> 01:06:15.021]  And now they admit last week fluoride is destroying your IQ, destroying fertility, giving you cancer.
[01:06:15.041 --> 01:06:17.603]  And they go, will it double the recommended level?
[01:06:17.623 --> 01:06:18.083]  Well, the U.N.
[01:06:18.123 --> 01:06:24.226]  recommends 0.5% per million.
[01:06:24.746 --> 01:06:25.186]  The U.S.
[01:06:25.226 --> 01:06:26.027]  puts 1.6 in.
[01:06:27.387 --> 01:06:29.248]  So that's triple.
[01:06:30.989 --> 01:06:32.790]  And they test some water supplies they're putting
[01:06:33.902 --> 01:06:38.285]  Three parts per million in, I mean, and you look at stuff like powdered eggs has it in it.
[01:06:39.205 --> 01:06:40.906]  This is being done on purpose.
[01:06:43.548 --> 01:06:44.588]  It's rat poison!
[01:06:46.329 --> 01:06:46.849]  Look it up!
[01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:51.192]  They got rid of it in the 50s because it was dangerous to humans, but put it in your water.
[01:06:51.832 --> 01:06:58.896]  You just dusted it, fluoride powder, and if a rat or a mouse or a bug walked through it, dead in just a few days.
[01:06:59.877 --> 01:07:01.758]  They lick their feet, they get it on because of the skin, bye-bye!
[01:07:01.798 --> 01:07:02.038]  Bye-bye!
[01:07:04.366 --> 01:07:05.967]  So here's Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:07:06.687 --> 01:07:17.513]  Seeing this just this big alignment, and even on environmental issues, it's so weird to me because the Democrats have become subsumed in this carbon orthodoxy.
[01:07:17.653 --> 01:07:21.995]  And you and I have talked about this, that the only issue is carbon.
[01:07:22.655 --> 01:07:27.698]  And what that's done is it's forced them to do something that you should never do if you're an environmentalist.
[01:07:28.996 --> 01:07:31.658]  Which is to commoditize and quantify everything.
[01:07:31.718 --> 01:07:35.962]  So everything is measured by its carbon footprint, how many tons of carbon it produces.
[01:07:36.102 --> 01:07:50.234]  And, you know, you're basically, you're putting everything in that kind of box of being able to quantify it and explain its value by, you know, by a numerically
[01:07:51.355 --> 01:07:54.616]  And the reason that we protect the environment is just the opposite of that.
[01:07:54.696 --> 01:07:58.277]  The reason that we protect the environment is because there's a spiritual connection.
[01:07:58.837 --> 01:08:02.198]  There's a, you know, there's a love that we have.
[01:08:02.898 --> 01:08:11.441]  You know, I got into the environment because I wanted, you know, this connection to the fishes and the birds and the wildlife and the whales.
[01:08:13.522 --> 01:08:36.338]  And, and the Purple Mountain's majesty and that, you know, I understood that the way, you know, God talks to human beings through many vectors, through each other, through organized religion, through the great prophets, through the wise people, the great books of those religions, but nowhere was a kind of detail and texture and grace and joy as through creation.
[01:08:37.499 --> 01:08:48.247]  And when we destroy nature, we diminish our capacity to sense the divine, to understand who God is and what our own potential is and duties are as human beings.
[01:08:48.548 --> 01:08:55.173]  And that... I hope what you just said, by the way, is chopped up and put all over every social media platform in the world!
[01:08:55.713 --> 01:08:59.996]  When we destroy nature, we degrade our own ability to experience the divine.
[01:09:00.797 --> 01:09:04.441]  And that, you know, it's not about quantifying stuff.
[01:09:04.481 --> 01:09:05.742]  That's what the devil does.
[01:09:05.762 --> 01:09:07.784]  He quantifies everything, right?
[01:09:08.044 --> 01:09:10.507]  And that is, you know, what he wants us doing.
[01:09:10.707 --> 01:09:11.628]  Put a number on it.
[01:09:12.769 --> 01:09:17.653]  And the reason we're preserving these things is because we love our children.
[01:09:18.595 --> 01:09:26.758]  You know, and it's because we get, nature enriches us, enriches us economically and spiritually and culturally and historically.
[01:09:27.959 --> 01:09:33.020]  It connects us to those 10,000 generations of human beings that were here before there were laptops.
[01:09:34.101 --> 01:09:39.663]  And it, you know, and it connects us to the most important spiritual essence of every
[01:09:43.138 --> 01:09:52.627]  All of the organized religions that we know of today, the central revelation of every one of those religions always occurred in the wilderness.
[01:09:53.688 --> 01:10:00.696]  You know, Moses had to go into the wilderness to hear God's voice and see the burning bush.
[01:10:00.716 --> 01:10:02.097]  He had to go to the wilderness amount.
[01:10:03.278 --> 01:10:03.859]  I think?
[01:10:23.704 --> 01:10:33.918]  Buddha had to go into the wilderness to sit under the, you know, and wander for years and then sit under the Bodhi Gayatri to get his first revelation of nirvana.
[01:10:34.799 --> 01:10:37.503]  And Christ had to spend 40 days in the wilderness.
[01:10:38.504 --> 01:10:40.445]  to discover his divinity for the first time.
[01:10:41.006 --> 01:10:48.851]  And his mentor was John the Baptist, who lived in a cave in the Jordan Valley and ate honey of wild bees and locusts.
[01:10:49.191 --> 01:10:52.753]  And, you know, and then all of Christ's parables come from nature.
[01:10:52.853 --> 01:10:58.057]  I'm the vine, you are the branches, the mustard seed, the little swallows, the scattering the seeds on the fallow ground.
[01:10:58.737 --> 01:11:01.039]  Because that is where we sense the divine.
[01:11:01.139 --> 01:11:04.141]  God talks to us through the fishes, the birds, the leaves.
[01:11:04.181 --> 01:11:06.823]  They're all, you know, words from our Creator.
[01:11:07.723 --> 01:11:09.924]  And that is why we preserve nature.
[01:11:09.944 --> 01:11:10.144]  Yes.
[01:11:10.564 --> 01:11:16.506]  It's not because of the, you know, it's not because the, you know, the quantity of carbon.
[01:11:16.626 --> 01:11:20.247]  And by the way, I feel what you said so deeply, I can hardly even express it.
[01:11:20.267 --> 01:11:21.247]  And thank you for saying that.
[01:11:22.928 --> 01:11:28.930]  They want a global AI system that tracks all your activities and taxes and controls you with a social credit score.
[01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:29.750]  That's why they want it.
[01:11:31.210 --> 01:11:32.511]  We're the carbon they want to reduce.
[01:11:34.651 --> 01:11:36.132]  It's the new Ponzi scheme.
[01:11:37.051 --> 01:11:37.972]  It's got to be stopped.
[01:11:39.153 --> 01:11:41.835]  And they tell white people they're bad because they're white.
[01:11:42.735 --> 01:11:44.937]  They tell men they're bad because they're men.
[01:11:45.697 --> 01:11:48.800]  They tell people that have a little bit of money in the West, you're greedy, you're bad.
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:54.103]  The DNC, when they're the richest people in America, the politicians, per capita.
[01:11:54.504 --> 01:11:55.925]  Democrats have over 70% of the wealth.
[01:11:58.126 --> 01:11:58.987]  They want you guilty.
[01:11:59.007 --> 01:11:59.928]  They want you hating yourself.
[01:11:59.968 --> 01:12:02.910]  And Alex Stein did like a 15-minute video with one of his crew members, toddlers,
[01:12:04.039 --> 01:12:05.140]  I'm only going to play a short clip of it.
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:09.423]  Last night, he did it on the show out of the Blaze operation.
[01:12:10.464 --> 01:12:15.989]  And it looks preposterous to be telling a two-year-old or a year-and-a-half-old, you're bad because you're white.
[01:12:16.509 --> 01:12:18.250]  And the baby doesn't understand why he's saying it.
[01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:22.654]  But that's how preposterous—they're teaching this in preschool.
[01:12:22.674 --> 01:12:23.875]  They're teaching it in elementary school.
[01:12:23.895 --> 01:12:24.896]  They're teaching it in middle school.
[01:12:24.916 --> 01:12:25.616]  They're teaching it in high school.
[01:12:25.636 --> 01:12:26.477]  They're teaching it in college.
[01:12:26.857 --> 01:12:28.118]  They're teaching it in the corporations.
[01:12:28.198 --> 01:12:31.141]  I mean, IBM came out this year and said, we're not hiring any more white people.
[01:12:31.874 --> 01:12:32.474]  Because you're bad.
[01:12:32.494 --> 01:12:33.475]  Because you've got a leg up.
[01:12:33.855 --> 01:12:38.697]  You look at the top nine wealthiest groups per capita in the West, it's Asians.
[01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:41.538]  They're not spending their time on average running around complaining.
[01:12:41.558 --> 01:12:42.158]  They're working.
[01:12:42.799 --> 01:12:43.719]  It's not white people.
[01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:46.060]  And good for the Asians being wealthy and successful.
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:46.680]  We need that.
[01:12:48.321 --> 01:12:49.361]  So this is disgusting.
[01:12:50.522 --> 01:12:52.283]  So this seems like satire, but it's not even satire.
[01:12:52.303 --> 01:12:52.843]  Here's Alex Stein.
[01:12:54.377 --> 01:12:57.938]  You're a white person and you're responsible for all of black people's problems?
[01:12:58.398 --> 01:13:01.518]  Because at one point, your ancestors owned slaves?
[01:13:02.939 --> 01:13:03.659]  Yes, they did.
[01:13:04.059 --> 01:13:06.840]  I don't care what they tell you, even if you're not related to them.
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.100]  You being white is oppressive to a whole group of people.
[01:13:12.041 --> 01:13:13.061]  You are an oppressor.
[01:13:13.101 --> 01:13:14.001]  Do you understand that?
[01:13:14.141 --> 01:13:20.202]  The earlier you understand that you're an oppressor to not only black people, but also Hispanic people that are here illegally.
[01:13:21.303 --> 01:13:22.003]  Yes, you are!
[01:13:22.063 --> 01:13:23.283]  You are oppressing illegals!
[01:13:26.281 --> 01:13:41.339]  I mean, it just seems ridiculous, but that's what they're—and they're also trying—they have pledges in places like Minnesota where the teachers have to brainwash kids, particularly autistic, and say, you're really a girl if you're a boy, you're a—if you're a boy, you're a girl, if you're a girl, you're a boy, or something else.
[01:13:42.349 --> 01:13:42.889]  We're good to go.
[01:13:59.033 --> 01:14:12.842]  And then they progress throughout the school with a secret file and give you lawyers and give you social workers through Planned Parenthood and other groups that induce you into a program that will chemically or surgically sterilize you.
[01:14:13.162 --> 01:14:21.327]  This is a cult run by the intelligence agencies with the biggest funders and financiers and BlackRock supporting it and behind it.
[01:14:21.888 --> 01:14:24.249]  Waltz didn't just put tampons in all the boys' rooms.
[01:14:26.325 --> 01:14:27.206]  We're good to go.
[01:14:49.622 --> 01:14:52.063]  Because he does a great job, and the listeners love him, breaking this down.
[01:14:52.083 --> 01:14:53.523]  He's an economist, Dr. Kirk Elliott.
[01:14:53.803 --> 01:14:56.324]  The promise of interest rate hikes causes silver to soar.
[01:14:56.804 --> 01:15:04.326]  Kamala's back with another communist plan, not just price fixing or free houses for illegals, but a plan to tax capital gains at almost 70%.
[01:15:05.766 --> 01:15:07.967]  That would kill the economy so quickly, it'll make your head spin.
[01:15:08.307 --> 01:15:11.408]  Democrat Party communist policies have been in control.
[01:15:12.631 --> 01:15:12.911]  I'm good.
[01:15:28.325 --> 01:15:34.891]  The Federal Reserve pal takes and talks about a rate hike in September and lies about their fight against inflation.
[01:15:35.272 --> 01:15:36.593]  We've got precious metals updates.
[01:15:36.613 --> 01:15:40.016]  We've got a global agenda update on BRICS and so much more.
[01:15:40.076 --> 01:15:48.625]  So let's get started in the limited time we have right now with Dr. Kirk Elliott of KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:50.947]  If you want silver, if you want gold at the
[01:15:50.947 --> 01:15:52.168]  The lowest prices you're going to find.
[01:15:52.248 --> 01:15:53.149]  Ready to deliver now.
[01:15:53.649 --> 01:15:54.750]  This is the place to go.
[01:15:55.050 --> 01:16:01.895]  And you've seen gold and silver continue to soar with all the inflation and all the industry developments and all the new discoveries where these metals are needed.
[01:16:02.015 --> 01:16:08.880]  You are crazy if you have extra assets and you are not seriously giving them a call and
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:10.421]  They're not going to rush sell you.
[01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:11.964]  They're going to try to find out what you need.
[01:16:12.024 --> 01:16:14.787]  Dude, I'm just going to plug up front because you're not even here to plug, but we're going to do it.
[01:16:15.088 --> 01:16:16.890]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:16:16.930 --> 01:16:17.852]  And he's a huge sponsor.
[01:16:18.132 --> 01:16:19.173]  That is a 360 win.
[01:16:19.213 --> 01:16:21.376]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:16:21.657 --> 01:16:23.219]  Dr. Kirk Elliott, great to have you here with us today.
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.722]  It's so great to be with you, Alex.
[01:16:27.179 --> 01:16:27.880]  Where do you want to start?
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:29.461]  You sent me, as usual, a great breakdown.
[01:16:46.514 --> 01:16:57.162]  Now, for literally, Alex, over a year, they've said, we're gonna lower interest rates, we're gonna lower interest rates, and because we've won this battle against inflation, right?
[01:16:57.202 --> 01:17:03.187]  Well, if they would have won the battle against inflation, they would have lowered interest rates already.
[01:17:03.687 --> 01:17:08.631]  So that tells us that they actually have not, because they're reluctant to do so.
[01:17:09.171 --> 01:17:12.614]  But now we're entering into election season, and
[01:17:13.274 --> 01:17:23.801]  They've got to do something, because if they keep interest rates where they are, at these lofty levels, they go into the vote with a massive recession.
[01:17:24.744 --> 01:17:26.745]  And it was Bill Clinton that said it really good.
[01:17:26.765 --> 01:17:28.445]  It's like, it's the economy, stupid.
[01:17:28.485 --> 01:17:29.025]  It's your wallet.
[01:17:29.305 --> 01:17:31.086]  People are going to vote with their wallets, right?
[01:17:31.146 --> 01:17:35.727]  So they do not want to go into November in a massive recession.
[01:17:35.787 --> 01:17:43.949]  So they're going to take what they think, and this is where they may be wrong, is the lesser of two evils.
[01:17:44.009 --> 01:17:48.290]  And they're just going to lower interest rates some, like what we've said they were going to do.
[01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:50.751]  We've said numerous times on this show,
[01:17:51.351 --> 01:17:54.935]  That they were going to lower them once, maybe twice before the election.
[01:17:54.975 --> 01:18:03.883]  Now I'm guessing twice, because they have to try to stimulate the economy so people can go into the voting booth happy that they're doing a good job.
[01:18:04.424 --> 01:18:06.506]  They're not going to trick anybody, right?
[01:18:07.026 --> 01:18:14.994]  So here's this meeting at Jackson Hole, and they said they're going to lower interest rates, and they're actually lying about it.
[01:18:15.214 --> 01:18:21.877]  What what they're going to do, because how do you how do you slow down inflation?
[01:18:22.418 --> 01:18:25.619]  And you have to actually raise interest rates.
[01:18:25.679 --> 01:18:26.340]  That's how you do it.
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:32.963]  So Powell in his announcement said, we've done everything to get inflation down to two percent.
[01:18:33.043 --> 01:18:33.783]  This is our goal.
[01:18:33.803 --> 01:18:39.386]  It's like you haven't done everything to get that down because you're printing money like there's no tomorrow.
[01:18:40.106 --> 01:18:41.327]  That is inflation.
[01:18:42.537 --> 01:18:43.357]  That's inflation.
[01:18:43.898 --> 01:18:53.502]  So here's what, remember last week when we were speaking on the show, we talked about what happens when the Fed lowers interest rates to stimulate the economy.
[01:18:54.162 --> 01:19:00.885]  Silver on average goes up over 300% every single time they lower interest rates.
[01:19:01.305 --> 01:19:11.150]  So going back to the year 2000, excuse me, we had interest, excuse me, I have something in my throat.
[01:19:12.594 --> 01:19:15.297]  We had basically 9-11.
[01:19:15.317 --> 01:19:22.125]  9-11 destroyed the economy and so they had to lower interest rates to get the economy afloat again.
[01:19:22.926 --> 01:19:24.047]  After that, in 2001, silver went up 414%.
[01:19:29.153 --> 01:19:35.879]  Right, and then in 2008-2009, when we had the big massive subprime meltdown, what did they do?
[01:19:36.119 --> 01:19:39.201]  They lowered interest rates down to a zerp, a zero interest rate policy.
[01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:40.522]  Silver went up over 440%.
[01:19:41.763 --> 01:19:46.107]  In COVID, in March of 2020, interest rates were already low.
[01:19:46.127 --> 01:19:48.689]  They lowered them a little bit, and silver went up over 100%.
[01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:53.732]  Now, they're going to do it again because they have to, Alex.
[01:19:53.972 --> 01:19:59.775]  They absolutely have to, to try to stimulate the economy so people don't vote in the midst of a recession.
[01:20:00.476 --> 01:20:06.739]  Look, silver is about to soar and Jerome Powell tells us what's going to happen.
[01:20:08.638 --> 01:20:15.642]  You've got this bad economy, and here's where the policies of the left are so extreme.
[01:20:15.702 --> 01:20:21.706]  So on that list of articles that I sent you, Kamala's backing Biden's tax plan.
[01:20:22.367 --> 01:20:25.508]  This thing is absolute flipping communism, Alex.
[01:20:26.289 --> 01:20:29.811]  So what is their tax plan?
[01:20:30.431 --> 01:20:33.794]  So they want to raise capital gains, yeah, that one right there, to 44.6%.
[01:20:38.044 --> 01:20:44.169]  So that means whenever you have an investment and you're selling it and there's a gain, you're paying the government almost 50 percent.
[01:20:44.669 --> 01:20:45.190]  No, they're not.
[01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:47.832]  Because look at what they're doing before that.
[01:20:48.312 --> 01:20:59.741]  They want to now part of this is an unrealized capital gains of 25 percent, meaning they want to tax you on something that you never sold just on its value.
[01:21:00.181 --> 01:21:03.003]  So let's say this is how insidious this is.
[01:21:03.464 --> 01:21:04.765]  Let's say that you had a house.
[01:21:05.225 --> 01:21:05.485]  I don't know.
[01:21:20.495 --> 01:21:31.840]  So they would say, hey Alex, you owe us $75,000 in an unrealized capital gain, and if you had no money in the bank, you're gonna say, crap, now what am I gonna do?
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:38.862]  I got tax bill of $75,000, I don't have any money, I'm gonna have to sell it to make the money to pay the taxes.
[01:21:39.222 --> 01:21:42.424]  When you sell it, you get a realized capital gain of 44.6%.
[01:21:42.504 --> 01:21:44.064]  You just paid the government 70%
[01:21:48.306 --> 01:21:52.429]  Of the value of that growth and stinking capital gains.
[01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:54.912]  So that's, that's, that's French level communism.
[01:21:55.532 --> 01:21:57.754]  That's French level taxation.
[01:21:57.774 --> 01:21:58.835]  I mean, that's as high as it gets.
[01:22:00.011 --> 01:22:01.931]  Yeah, I mean, that's ridiculous.
[01:22:01.971 --> 01:22:08.253]  No, that's just the capital gains and people still have income taxes and sales taxes and property taxes and everything else, right?
[01:22:09.473 --> 01:22:24.336]  So under this communism type plan where they want to take care of everybody and you've got all these entitlements and you've got all these illegals coming across the border, and Chicago's been the net recipient of pretty much a lot of them, as has Denver, as I look out our window here.
[01:22:25.916 --> 01:22:33.822]  And so there's a story that I saw just two days ago about this guy in Chicago who has some kind of a loft downtown.
[01:22:34.203 --> 01:22:36.364]  His annual property taxes were $23,000 a year.
[01:22:36.384 --> 01:22:37.625]  Guess what it just went up to?
[01:22:37.645 --> 01:22:42.849]  $128,000 a year in taxes, which means he has to raise his rent by $5,000 a month just to pay the extra taxes.
[01:22:42.869 --> 01:22:43.009]  And so
[01:22:52.717 --> 01:22:58.899]  When the left and their communist thing say, we're gonna attack the rich, who are they really attacking?
[01:22:59.159 --> 01:23:02.240]  The poor, the ones that voted for them, the underprivileged?
[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:10.223]  Because now nobody can rent that place without paying this exorbitant fee, and they thought they were attacking the wealthy when they're not.
[01:23:10.443 --> 01:23:14.925]  They're actually attacking everybody, even the people that they're pretending to help.
[01:23:15.365 --> 01:23:18.066]  This is why it is so incredibly important
[01:23:18.726 --> 01:23:23.168]  That Trump gets back into office and we pray for his success.
[01:23:23.208 --> 01:23:24.809]  No, I totally agree, but let me just interrupt you.
[01:23:24.829 --> 01:23:27.350]  Let me interrupt you because you're hitting my pet peeve here.
[01:23:27.370 --> 01:23:28.130]  I love you, Dr. Elliott.
[01:23:28.150 --> 01:23:32.612]  I'm not saying you're wrong or bad, but you're being kind and you're not naive.
[01:23:33.372 --> 01:23:36.093]  Everybody, including Trump, goes, the Democrats are idiots.
[01:23:36.133 --> 01:23:42.916]  Don't they know when they skyrocket property taxes or increase capital gain taxes, that's just going to be passed on to the general public?
[01:23:43.456 --> 01:23:57.772]  They know when they cut off the pipelines and cut off the oil drilling and won't let us build coal power plants and shut down our power plants and increase prices on fertilizer, they know that squeezes the little guy and the big private central banks in Blackrock
[01:23:58.433 --> 01:24:01.054]  During the lockdowns, doubled their wealth and profits.
[01:24:01.074 --> 01:24:03.415]  The average globalist doubled their wealth, some tripled it.
[01:24:03.775 --> 01:24:04.856]  It's vertical integration.
[01:24:05.196 --> 01:24:09.997]  They've got unlimited capital, so when they squeeze everybody else, they stay in power.
[01:24:10.017 --> 01:24:12.358]  Let's come back and talk about that and they get more power.
[01:24:12.398 --> 01:24:13.039]  I mean, it's simple.
[01:24:13.439 --> 01:24:15.260]  The environmentalists aren't wackos, folks.
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.680]  They're taking over everything.
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:18.961]  It's a power grab.
[01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:24.183]  An Infowars fan favorite is now back in stock after over a year of not being available.
[01:24:24.861 --> 01:24:27.262]  It is the Vitamin C and Zinc with Rosehips.
[01:24:27.803 --> 01:24:33.586]  Now, this is a copy of Linus Pauling, who won the Nobel Prize for his findings of Vitamin C's formula.
[01:24:34.186 --> 01:24:41.790]  It is a thousand milligrams of organic Vitamin C with zinc to take it into the cells and Rosehips.
[01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:43.451]  He believed that supercharged it.
[01:24:44.031 --> 01:24:45.412]  This formula is amazing.
[01:24:45.832 --> 01:24:50.835]  We've not had it for over 12 months, and now it's available back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:24:51.315 --> 01:24:52.656]  It is simply incredible.

[01:25:19.304 --> 01:25:21.625]  Now I wasn't really getting on to Dr. Kirk Elliott.
[01:25:22.165 --> 01:25:23.406]  He's just a polite gentleman.
[01:25:24.466 --> 01:25:25.267]  We talk a lot off air.
[01:25:25.367 --> 01:25:27.388]  He knows it's a conscious plan to implode the economy.
[01:25:28.168 --> 01:25:32.610]  We just, in my humble view, need to really get it straight in our minds.
[01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:36.011]  Yeah, Kamala's a complete idiot and just a puppet in an empty suit.
[01:25:37.832 --> 01:25:40.853]  But the people controlling this do not want you to be successful.
[01:25:41.213 --> 01:25:42.594]  They do not want you to be middle class.
[01:25:42.614 --> 01:25:44.475]  Because they don't want you to be independent.
[01:25:45.555 --> 01:25:46.596]  They want you domesticated.
[01:25:47.492 --> 01:25:55.899]  And you've got the Democrats in control for 12 of the last 16 years of the government trying to tell you now that the problems of the economy are Trump.
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.683]  Here's a clip of CNN though saying the truth out loud.
[01:26:01.563 --> 01:26:06.748]  In all these speeches, as good as they were, is that she's in the White House right now.
[01:26:08.188 --> 01:26:11.593]  Democrats have controlled the White House for 12 of the last 16 years.
[01:26:11.793 --> 01:26:19.543]  And for all of the talk about division and the problems in the country and people are hurting, Democrats have mostly controlled this country.
[01:26:20.645 --> 01:26:21.666]  Trump had it for four.
[01:26:22.647 --> 01:26:24.009]  The Obamas and Biden
[01:26:24.815 --> 01:26:32.000]  Had it for the rest of the time and somehow it's still all Trump's fault and somehow she hasn't been at the center of it.
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:37.504]  So to me, that's still the glaring hole in this campaign that hasn't yet been solved at the convention.
[01:26:38.325 --> 01:26:48.633]  How do you explain all of the problems that will be solved by the person who is currently in there for the last three and a half years who is supposed to already be working on solving it?
[01:26:49.090 --> 01:26:51.572]  Well, they look like deer in the headlights there, Dr. Elliott.
[01:26:51.592 --> 01:26:56.054]  Speak to that, and then you got caught off by the break, making your point that they are wrecking the economy.
[01:26:57.415 --> 01:27:00.998]  Well, they are, and we do talk a lot off-air.
[01:27:01.418 --> 01:27:04.460]  And I fully agree, they're doing it on purpose, because
[01:27:05.154 --> 01:27:07.195]  Yeah, Kamala might be an idiot, right?
[01:27:07.235 --> 01:27:10.697]  But the people that are managing this thing are not.
[01:27:11.177 --> 01:27:12.938]  They're just evil.
[01:27:13.519 --> 01:27:16.960]  And when you look at 12 of the last 16 years, this guy is right.
[01:27:17.521 --> 01:27:18.501]  He's absolutely right.
[01:27:18.681 --> 01:27:19.982]  Trump gets the blame for everything.
[01:27:20.002 --> 01:27:21.463]  But you know what Kamala's doing?
[01:27:22.083 --> 01:27:28.167]  She's blaming Trump and she's inadvertently or maybe inadvertently blaming Biden too.
[01:27:28.247 --> 01:27:28.747]  She said, you know,
[01:27:29.287 --> 01:27:32.849]  We have had inflation over the last four years and I'm going to fix it.
[01:27:32.869 --> 01:27:35.971]  And we've had this and people are having this huge disconnect.
[01:27:36.031 --> 01:27:37.051]  It's like, wait a second.
[01:27:37.571 --> 01:27:39.312]  She was in the stinking White House.
[01:27:39.813 --> 01:27:41.033]  This is part of her problem.
[01:27:41.073 --> 01:27:48.437]  But yet she's sort of blaming Biden because she's saying there's been inflation and people can't afford to live and people in America can't afford groceries.
[01:27:48.457 --> 01:27:50.938]  This is why I want to put a price cap on groceries.
[01:27:50.958 --> 01:27:52.359]  It's like, wait a second, lady.
[01:27:52.459 --> 01:27:53.560]  These were your policies.
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:55.181]  You were in office, right?
[01:27:56.161 --> 01:28:04.953]  It's this weird messaging that's going on, but they are trying to destroy it completely because they want all people control.
[01:28:04.993 --> 01:28:13.364]  And so the way that I can look at that and really exemplify that is by simply going to whitehouse.gov and looking at the federal budget.
[01:28:14.398 --> 01:28:23.863]  So, this goes back, and you and I have talked, oh man, I think it was the very first show that we ever did, we talked a little bit about the fall of Rome.
[01:28:23.883 --> 01:28:39.150]  Well, this reminded me of that show way back last year, where Rome fell, Alex, when one-third of the population of Rome was getting entitlements of some sort and handouts, you know, free food, free grain, whatever.
[01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:45.553]  Well, when you look at where America is today, see, they fell because of the weight of the entitlements.
[01:28:45.573 --> 01:28:48.535]  They could not support it anymore through taxation.
[01:28:49.235 --> 01:28:51.557]  So what happens now?
[01:28:52.157 --> 01:28:54.238]  Look at where we are with our budget.
[01:28:54.338 --> 01:29:04.164]  If you go to this table that I have in those charts here, the mandatory programs, what do we spend every single year in the year 2024?
[01:29:06.208 --> 01:29:27.158]  $1.4 trillion in Social Security, $842 billion on Medicare, $556 billion on Medicaid, other mandatory programs like women, infant, children programs, food stamps, whatever, comes to $3.916 trillion is what we spend on mandatory payments and handouts, okay?
[01:29:28.954 --> 01:29:31.938]  What do we bring in as a nation?
[01:29:32.919 --> 01:29:34.100]  $4.72 trillion.
[01:29:34.661 --> 01:29:43.832]  That means we're at like 83% of everything that we bring in as a nation is mandatory payments, food stamps, and entitlements.
[01:29:43.892 --> 01:29:44.813]  Those kind of things, right?
[01:29:46.235 --> 01:29:52.278]  Here's the massive problem moving forward, and that is the interest payment on our debt.
[01:29:52.338 --> 01:30:00.582]  Because our debt is 30, you know, we're pushing $34 trillion, $35 trillion in this massive, horrible debt spiral.
[01:30:01.223 --> 01:30:07.286]  Well, the interest only on that, you know, according to the budget, is $796 billion.
[01:30:07.846 --> 01:30:11.388]  According to the current numbers with these inflated interest rates that we have,
[01:30:12.068 --> 01:30:16.409]  We're pushing a trillion dollars a year in interest only payments.
[01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:25.032]  So you add the interest plus what we spend on Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, women and infant children programs, Social Security.
[01:30:26.053 --> 01:30:35.396]  It's basically 100% of everything that we bring in as a nation goes out just towards entitlements, mandatory payments and interest.
[01:30:36.056 --> 01:30:39.537]  You can't run the country with zero left.
[01:30:40.342 --> 01:30:47.444]  Literally, zero is left for infrastructure, for education, for Department of Defense, for everything else.
[01:30:47.484 --> 01:30:48.264]  There's nothing there.
[01:30:48.304 --> 01:30:49.185]  So we're coming to the end.
[01:30:49.225 --> 01:30:50.305]  We're coming to the end of the bubble.
[01:30:50.905 --> 01:30:52.446]  They've drained the Strategic Oil Reserve.
[01:30:53.906 --> 01:30:54.886]  They know we're at the end.
[01:30:55.107 --> 01:30:56.707]  And what are they going to pull?
[01:30:56.727 --> 01:31:00.208]  What are they going to do to jump us onto the new global currency?
[01:31:00.228 --> 01:31:03.549]  You'll still have dollars, but it'll be denominated in that central ledger.
[01:31:03.569 --> 01:31:09.031]  And that's in your list at the end of the talk today, but we should probably start going through that because you sent me a lot.
[01:31:09.994 --> 01:31:10.635]  Let's start here.
[01:31:11.076 --> 01:31:15.783]  Warren Buffett sells more Bank of America shares, reaping 982 million.
[01:31:16.284 --> 01:31:19.569]  So again, he's moving against his bank stocks, moving against his tech stocks.
[01:31:19.629 --> 01:31:20.370]  What does this signify?
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:23.282]  Well, he's a smart investor, right?
[01:31:23.322 --> 01:31:24.363]  The Oracle of Omaha.
[01:31:24.383 --> 01:31:27.326]  He's supposed to be this really smart investor guy, and he's not stupid.
[01:31:27.586 --> 01:31:30.629]  He's a multi-multi-billionaire, one of the richest people in the world.
[01:31:31.249 --> 01:31:34.613]  What is he signifying by selling all this Bank of America?
[01:31:34.633 --> 01:31:37.595]  He's sold over $5 billion worth of Bank of America.
[01:31:37.615 --> 01:31:41.019]  It used to be his second largest holding.
[01:31:41.679 --> 01:31:42.300]  What does he think?
[01:31:43.641 --> 01:31:45.143]  Bank stocks are not going to do well.
[01:31:45.644 --> 01:31:47.486]  Why would bank stocks not do well?
[01:31:48.007 --> 01:31:58.521]  Because under Bidenomics, when people aren't spending money because their wages are down or they're losing their jobs and inflation is persisting and the cost of borrowing is going up and taxes are through the roof,
[01:31:59.102 --> 01:32:04.025]  He knows that there's going to be delinquencies and ultimately defaults at the banks.
[01:32:04.445 --> 01:32:06.186]  He's getting out of dodge.
[01:32:06.446 --> 01:32:14.070]  That's what that tells me, because this isn't small chump change that he's saying, I'm just going to reallocate some of my position in the Bank of America.
[01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:17.171]  He's been nothing but bullish on it until now.
[01:32:17.191 --> 01:32:20.673]  He even says he's been coming on for 10 months, that this is imminent, and now it's beginning.
[01:32:22.538 --> 01:32:22.958]  It is.
[01:32:23.318 --> 01:32:31.384]  And we're seeing what started this was Japan, you know, and Japan starting to default on its treasuries and had to raise interest rates.
[01:32:31.464 --> 01:32:45.635]  And now that that amazing, you know, free money, the Japanese yen carry trade that we've had for decades is going away, which means people could borrow yen at zero, use that money and invest it elsewhere.
[01:32:46.076 --> 01:32:48.598]  Now that Japan's raising rates, that game is over.
[01:32:49.178 --> 01:32:50.780]  The gig is done, right?
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:56.825]  So this is going to impact the global economy in a huge way, and I think Warren Buffett knows that, right?
[01:32:57.566 --> 01:33:05.093]  So here's where, moving forward, if we don't have any kind of built-in demand for our currency,
[01:33:05.934 --> 01:33:09.297]  Because we're no longer the petrodollar, because currencies, they don't want it.
[01:33:09.337 --> 01:33:10.338]  They're dumping U.S.
[01:33:10.398 --> 01:33:10.799]  treasuries.
[01:33:11.259 --> 01:33:15.743]  I mean, China is dumping close to a trillion dollars worth of U.S.
[01:33:15.804 --> 01:33:18.606]  treasuries, you know, like now, as we speak.
[01:33:18.646 --> 01:33:22.069]  It's like, that would be almost everything that they have left, according to reports.
[01:33:22.210 --> 01:33:23.211]  So this is a race.
[01:33:23.651 --> 01:33:25.573]  Out of the dollar, more countries are joining the BRICS.
[01:33:25.613 --> 01:33:26.554]  What's the timeline here?
[01:33:28.018 --> 01:33:28.278]  Now.
[01:33:28.698 --> 01:33:30.820]  I mean, literally, the timeline is now.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:32.941]  It's right underneath our nose.
[01:33:33.582 --> 01:33:40.286]  So, before, earlier in the year, I thought, okay, this is all gonna be done probably close to the election, right?
[01:33:40.326 --> 01:33:43.688]  Because you're gonna- You predicted this would all go down before the election.
[01:33:45.205 --> 01:34:04.180]  Yeah, you know, over the summer I thought that this would all happen, and so now we're here, and this stuff is happening, but when we don't have the petrodollar, Alex, when there's no built-in demand for our currency, in other words, because oil settlements are no longer traded in the dollar, we're gonna have to print our way out of all of this mess, out of all of it.
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:07.962]  So I have this chart on here, demise of the dollar, right?
[01:34:08.863 --> 01:34:18.867]  This is what happened to the German mark after World War I. So, World War I, Germany bombed the living daylights out of the other countries, right?
[01:34:18.887 --> 01:34:26.090]  And then the Treaty of Versailles came in in the early 1900s, International Treaty, and said, hey, Germany, you gotta repay all your war debts.
[01:34:26.110 --> 01:34:26.890]  And they said, what?
[01:34:27.570 --> 01:34:28.251]  We thought we won.
[01:34:28.431 --> 01:34:29.531]  It's like, no, you gotta pay them back.
[01:34:30.011 --> 01:34:32.192]  So, they abandoned the gold standard.
[01:34:32.252 --> 01:34:33.533]  Gold used to back
[01:34:34.293 --> 01:34:36.215]  The German Rentenmark is what it was.
[01:34:36.255 --> 01:34:38.676]  And then they changed the name of it to the German Mark.
[01:34:38.716 --> 01:34:40.818]  But look at what this is.
[01:34:41.278 --> 01:34:45.421]  So what did it take in German marks to buy one ounce of gold?
[01:34:46.101 --> 01:34:46.762]  In January of 1919, 170.
[01:34:46.822 --> 01:34:47.382]  And one year later, 1340.
[01:34:47.422 --> 01:34:47.922]  One year after that, 1349.
[01:34:48.002 --> 01:34:48.203]  And then 3976.
[01:34:48.243 --> 01:34:48.543]  And then 372,000.
[01:34:48.603 --> 01:34:50.564]  And then 710,000 just four months after that.
[01:35:04.413 --> 01:35:08.235]  And then it goes to numbers that I don't even, I think they're in the trillions.
[01:35:08.515 --> 01:35:10.957]  1.3 trillion six months after that.
[01:35:11.437 --> 01:35:15.679]  The next month, 87 trillion to buy one ounce of gold.
[01:35:15.959 --> 01:35:25.864]  See, this is what happens when you start to print your way out of debt, start to print your way and you devalue your currency and the rest of the world no longer wants it.
[01:35:26.385 --> 01:35:30.287]  You go into this devaluation inflationary spiral.
[01:35:31.087 --> 01:35:34.869]  And we're not talking about some third world country here, Alex.
[01:35:35.369 --> 01:35:37.670]  Germany was the big kid on the block back then.
[01:35:37.710 --> 01:35:39.391]  They had a vibrant arts district.
[01:35:40.051 --> 01:35:41.212]  They had a big military.
[01:35:41.252 --> 01:35:45.454]  They had the best chemical and industrial systems.
[01:35:46.861 --> 01:35:47.541]  Absolutely.
[01:35:48.041 --> 01:35:49.102]  They had all of that.
[01:35:50.142 --> 01:35:54.483]  Okay, this is the parallel that we have today.
[01:35:55.043 --> 01:36:01.905]  Big kid on the block, doing great, abandoned the gold standard, inflationary pressures, couldn't pay it back.
[01:36:02.405 --> 01:36:08.406]  Mommies and daddies were putting their babies on the stair steps of fire stations because they couldn't afford to feed them.
[01:36:09.006 --> 01:36:11.427]  So then, this was post-World War I.
[01:36:12.367 --> 01:36:21.195]  Then, Hitler comes marching in, and campaigned on this promise of hope and change, and he said, hey everybody, I'll fix this, you know, just vote for me, and they did!
[01:36:21.956 --> 01:36:28.261]  The worst dictator in the history of the world, almost, gets voted in voluntarily!
[01:36:28.982 --> 01:36:31.103]  Right, because of an economic collapse.
[01:36:31.503 --> 01:36:44.467]  So I'm looking, and I'm not comparing Kamala to Hitler, right, but I'm saying these things, you've got a bad economy, people can't afford to live, we will willingly give up our freedoms in exchange for an absolute communist.
[01:36:45.387 --> 01:36:45.587]  Right?
[01:36:45.887 --> 01:36:47.808]  Who wants to tax us at 70%?
[01:36:49.029 --> 01:36:50.830]  Who wants to strip away our freedoms?
[01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:55.112]  And then you've got all these other dumb policies that are just ravaging America.
[01:36:55.152 --> 01:36:57.754]  I know that... But you just explained it.
[01:36:57.774 --> 01:37:02.456]  That's why Klaus Schwab said we're going to collapse the world economy with the Great Reset to build back better.
[01:37:02.856 --> 01:37:05.318]  That's why they want to wreck it on purpose because they think we're so stupid.
[01:37:05.638 --> 01:37:11.221]  They'll wreck it, blame conservative capitalist policies, and then bring in something far worse.
[01:37:13.604 --> 01:37:14.124]  Way worse.
[01:37:14.645 --> 01:37:15.085]  Way worse.
[01:37:15.145 --> 01:37:18.588]  Which, what is way worse than that?
[01:37:18.688 --> 01:37:26.073]  Well, way worse than that is bringing in a system of electronic digital money where they know everything about you.
[01:37:26.213 --> 01:37:28.735]  Everything you spend, your buying habits, your
[01:37:29.335 --> 01:37:40.905]  Your preferences, everything, and they say, OK, we don't like you, Kirk, or we don't like you, Alex, or we don't like you, Jane Doe, because of the church you give to or anything else, and we're just going to cut you off from your money with the flip of a switch.
[01:37:40.925 --> 01:37:42.487]  It's like, don't think it can happen?
[01:37:43.027 --> 01:37:44.869]  Look what happened when CrowdStrike went down.
[01:37:44.949 --> 01:37:46.710]  Everything shut down, right?
[01:37:46.750 --> 01:37:48.212]  It's like people couldn't even travel.
[01:37:48.232 --> 01:37:49.193]  They couldn't do anything.
[01:37:49.773 --> 01:37:54.357]  I was talking to Maria Z, which you know and love.
[01:37:54.398 --> 01:37:55.258]  She's amazing.
[01:37:55.579 --> 01:37:57.741]  Well, in Australia, they're doing similar things.
[01:37:57.761 --> 01:37:59.402]  They're going doing Real ID.
[01:37:59.803 --> 01:38:01.484]  New Zealand, they're doing the same thing.
[01:38:01.584 --> 01:38:03.506]  Indonesia, they're doing the same thing.
[01:38:03.546 --> 01:38:07.550]  It's like this is happening right now, right underneath our nose.
[01:38:08.010 --> 01:38:12.715]  And we're kind of unaware that this is why we need to shout it from the rooftop.
[01:38:12.755 --> 01:38:14.437]  So as we're like,
[01:38:15.017 --> 01:38:26.046]  Focused on, you know, this horrible election process and all this stuff and, you know, things that don't really matter sometimes, like Taylor Swift's outfit or whatever.
[01:38:26.547 --> 01:38:37.216]  You've got 159 countries that have now signed on, ready to use the BRICS, Central Bank Digital Currency Payment System.
[01:38:37.836 --> 01:38:38.696]  What does that mean?
[01:38:38.716 --> 01:38:43.718]  That means they're going to use the BRICS common currency instead of the U.S.
[01:38:43.778 --> 01:38:46.239]  dollar for trading back and forth.
[01:38:46.579 --> 01:38:49.020]  That kills all the demand for the dollar.
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:52.401]  It's like, well, Kirk, is that even close?
[01:38:53.021 --> 01:38:56.382]  Are they even close to having a BRICS common currency?
[01:38:57.082 --> 01:38:58.663]  Well, yeah, they are.
[01:38:59.143 --> 01:39:00.503]  It's close to completion.
[01:39:00.983 --> 01:39:01.704]  There's there's
[01:39:03.612 --> 01:39:11.483]  There's a meeting on October 21st and October 22nd in Russia, and what are they going to say there?
[01:39:11.983 --> 01:39:19.954]  They're actually planning on voting in the common currency for the BRICS nations in Russia in two months!
[01:39:21.075 --> 01:39:27.480]  And you've already got 159 countries that are signed off on it that said, we're not going to use the U.S.
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:28.101]  dollar anymore.
[01:39:28.121 --> 01:39:30.323]  We're going to use this other kind of common currency.
[01:39:30.923 --> 01:39:40.831]  And then there's an article on Zero Hedge where the BRICS currency, common currency, is ready for crypto to have a digital currency.
[01:39:40.911 --> 01:39:47.357]  This is where it becomes really dangerous, because when you when you're the BRICS nations, Alex, and what is China doing?
[01:39:47.997 --> 01:39:49.037]  Allocating into gold.
[01:39:49.057 --> 01:39:52.058]  They've got 30,000 tons of gold to back their currency.
[01:39:52.459 --> 01:39:58.580]  They're using that as this dangling carrot to say, hey, world, come into our central bank digital currency.
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:01.001]  The door is wide open and ready for you.
[01:40:01.441 --> 01:40:05.203]  And as soon as you go in and what's the carrot to get people to go through the door?
[01:40:05.403 --> 01:40:06.403]  A gold back currency.
[01:40:06.783 --> 01:40:09.164]  Once you go through, they slam the door and you never get out.
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:11.040]  See, this is the problem.
[01:40:25.276 --> 01:40:26.937]  I only promote things that I know are great.
[01:40:26.957 --> 01:40:28.398]  I'll use the analogy.
[01:40:28.438 --> 01:40:32.500]  The water filtration system we sell is the highest rated, gravity-fed, stainless steel filter.
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.561]  It cuts out thousands of things at non-detectable levels.
[01:40:34.981 --> 01:40:37.963]  It's portable, great in your house, great in your business, great in your cabin, everywhere.
[01:40:37.983 --> 01:40:39.504]  You get that at InfoWarsware.com.
[01:40:39.804 --> 01:40:40.385]  It's the same thing.
[01:40:40.565 --> 01:40:42.686]  I go out and find the best gold and silver company.
[01:40:43.547 --> 01:40:44.668]  That's got the best record.
[01:40:44.728 --> 01:40:45.648]  It's got the highest ratings.
[01:40:45.708 --> 01:40:46.949]  The biggest silver broker in America.
[01:40:46.969 --> 01:40:49.031]  25-year overnight success case.
[01:40:49.551 --> 01:40:52.293]  You need to go to KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:40:52.573 --> 01:40:55.155]  By going to forward slash gold, we get the support and sponsorship.
[01:40:55.615 --> 01:40:57.396]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:40:57.416 --> 01:40:59.998]  720-605-300.
[01:41:00.378 --> 01:41:00.759]  Call them.
[01:41:01.099 --> 01:41:02.300]  They'll give you a consultation.
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.961]  If you call after hours, they'll call you back in the morning.
[01:41:04.481 --> 01:41:08.643]  And they'll talk to you about your hopes and dreams and the different products they've got, the different things they can do.
[01:41:09.043 --> 01:41:12.684]  KEPM.com forward slash gold 720605300.
[01:41:13.564 --> 01:41:15.505]  They can convert IRAs, all sorts of other things.
[01:41:15.525 --> 01:41:18.246]  But the big thing is they don't even hold the gold and silver.
[01:41:18.266 --> 01:41:21.147]  They have depositories that just ship it right to you.
[01:41:22.107 --> 01:41:24.028]  It's a flat low rate, nothing to sell it back.
[01:41:24.548 --> 01:41:29.510]  If you're going to get into gold and silver, which is a default smart move in my view, I don't think it's so easy to say that.
[01:41:29.530 --> 01:41:32.191]  It's like if you're going into the desert, you need a hat and water.
[01:41:33.467 --> 01:41:36.628]  And probably, you know, communication and a map.
[01:41:36.768 --> 01:41:39.989]  I mean, this is like taking a canteen of water into the desert.
[01:41:40.029 --> 01:41:40.930]  Probably two or three canteens.
[01:41:40.950 --> 01:41:42.070]  We're going to be out there for a few days.
[01:41:42.490 --> 01:41:46.491]  This is an absolute no-brainer and it supports the broadcast.
[01:41:46.531 --> 01:41:47.472]  It's the best place to go.
[01:41:47.552 --> 01:41:51.353]  KEPM.com forward slash gold or 720605300.
[01:41:51.673 --> 01:41:54.394]  And you see gold and silver steadily going up with all these different factors.
[01:41:54.854 --> 01:41:56.355]  But I wouldn't even get it for that.
[01:41:56.415 --> 01:41:56.855]  It's because
[01:41:57.415 --> 01:41:59.636]  It really just protects you from the inflation.
[01:41:59.737 --> 01:42:00.817]  I don't even see it as an investment.
[01:42:01.137 --> 01:42:04.359]  I see it as a escape boat, as a lifeboat.
[01:42:04.439 --> 01:42:09.322]  So, whether it's a little silver, a bunch of silver, a little gold, a lot of gold, now is the time.
[01:42:09.342 --> 01:42:13.165]  But Kirk will tell you, gold's not the way to go right now, because silver keeps outperforming.
[01:42:13.185 --> 01:42:14.266]  It's got a lot more to grow.
[01:42:14.526 --> 01:42:21.270]  Yeah, gold's going up, but you can buy a lot more silver, and then later, when gold skyrockets even faster, the evidence shows it should be going that direction, we believe.
[01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:26.253]  Then you're able to take the profits from silver and then move into gold if that's what you're wanting.
[01:42:26.513 --> 01:42:30.176]  Kurt, tell people for a few minutes when we get back in the news, but the real important move is to call you.
[01:42:30.536 --> 01:42:31.277]  Such a no-brainer.
[01:42:31.517 --> 01:42:32.638]  People really should do it right now.
[01:42:33.138 --> 01:42:33.959]  I mean, just look at the evidence.
[01:42:34.139 --> 01:42:36.881]  It's just, there's not a sure thing in this world except a relationship with God.
[01:42:37.601 --> 01:42:40.324]  Okay, and the fact that mama loves you, at least most mothers do.
[01:42:40.784 --> 01:42:47.170]  But you need to get silver, you need to make the move right now at KEPM.com forward slash gold or 720-605-3900.
[01:42:47.570 --> 01:42:50.173]  Write it down, folks.
[01:42:50.593 --> 01:42:53.035]  I mean, it's outperformed all other investments.
[01:42:53.355 --> 01:42:54.677]  I'm not even saying get it for that.
[01:42:54.737 --> 01:42:56.378]  You can't trust the digital system.
[01:42:56.699 --> 01:42:58.880]  If you're all in cash, you're all in banks, you're nuts.
[01:42:59.241 --> 01:43:03.425]  The elites, the banks, the universities, the billionaires, they're buying gold and silver.
[01:43:04.265 --> 01:43:06.866]  And now they're admitting in the news that they're having major problems.
[01:43:06.886 --> 01:43:07.666]  Like they have it over here.
[01:43:08.407 --> 01:43:10.928]  Even supplying enough silver.
[01:43:10.948 --> 01:43:11.988]  So that's going to make it go up.
[01:43:12.328 --> 01:43:14.629]  The mines can't even keep the output, which you said.
[01:43:14.649 --> 01:43:16.590]  That's why globalists are buying gold.
[01:43:16.610 --> 01:43:18.771]  There's not enough silver for all the fake money they've got.
[01:43:18.791 --> 01:43:20.491]  They don't have enough silver for them.
[01:43:20.571 --> 01:43:23.332]  So that's really why all the indicators are silver.
[01:43:23.372 --> 01:43:24.853]  Tell people about some of the services you've got.
[01:43:26.383 --> 01:43:30.247]  Yeah, so we just want to protect and preserve people's assets, right?
[01:43:30.307 --> 01:43:32.048]  So we can do it through an IRA.
[01:43:32.408 --> 01:43:36.012]  Like, if you have an IRA, don't ever do paper silver.
[01:43:36.052 --> 01:43:37.193]  It's not the same, right?
[01:43:37.373 --> 01:43:41.617]  Because your advisor will say, oh, let's do ETFs or mining shares or mutual funds, whatever.
[01:43:41.677 --> 01:43:42.377]  Not the same.
[01:43:43.138 --> 01:43:45.079]  If we're talking about silver, you got to do silver.
[01:43:45.139 --> 01:43:46.459]  Everything else is just paper.
[01:43:46.539 --> 01:43:48.760]  So we can do IRA rollovers.
[01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:51.320]  If it has IRA in the name, we can do it.
[01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:55.702]  Whether it's a simple, a SEP, a Roth, a traditional, an inherited, right?
[01:43:55.742 --> 01:44:01.843]  We can do old 401ks if it's from a previous employer or even a current one if you're older than 59 and a half.
[01:44:02.303 --> 01:44:07.125]  So that's where the majority of people have their wealth tied up is in retirement plans.
[01:44:07.825 --> 01:44:12.748]  Most people don't know, Alex, you can do those into physical gold and silver.
[01:44:12.908 --> 01:44:13.648]  It's amazing.
[01:44:14.388 --> 01:44:25.334]  Or you can do it outside of an IRA, where you take delivery of it at home or set up a depository account at a depository in Texas that we use, and it's very safe, 100% insured.
[01:44:25.494 --> 01:44:26.355]  It's incredible, right?
[01:44:27.435 --> 01:44:30.598]  So now, just setting those up is just what we do.
[01:44:30.618 --> 01:44:32.059]  This is like the bookends.
[01:44:32.479 --> 01:44:37.783]  But in between those, we'll always let you know when it's time to buy, sell, reallocate, do whatever needs to be done.
[01:44:37.843 --> 01:44:45.229]  We'll hold your hand through this economy because I don't expect my clients to actually watch the markets like a hawk.
[01:44:45.450 --> 01:44:46.891]  That's what we do, right?
[01:44:46.911 --> 01:44:49.173]  So we'll always let you know when it's time to do anything.
[01:44:49.213 --> 01:44:56.518]  And we send out a video email every single week letting you know my thoughts on the markets, what you should be joyful about, and what you should be careful about.
[01:44:57.279 --> 01:44:59.100]  So that's what we do moving forward.
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:01.261]  Now, not all gold dealers are the same.
[01:45:01.622 --> 01:45:03.223]  Not all gold or silver is the same.
[01:45:03.303 --> 01:45:05.324]  There's something you should absolutely not touch.
[01:45:05.944 --> 01:45:15.650]  Well, I think what separates us from the masses is our simple pricing practices, which are 0% when you liquidate.
[01:45:15.690 --> 01:45:16.670]  We don't charge anything.
[01:45:16.711 --> 01:45:18.792]  You get all of it, whatever the depository is paying.
[01:45:18.832 --> 01:45:20.012]  You get all of that when you sell.
[01:45:20.553 --> 01:45:21.433]  When you purchase, it's 8%.
[01:45:22.754 --> 01:45:23.114]  That's it.
[01:45:23.134 --> 01:45:26.156]  8% when you purchase, 0% when you liquidate.
[01:45:26.496 --> 01:45:30.438]  We'll help you out in between and make sure that you have a smile on your face.
[01:45:31.458 --> 01:45:33.419]  And how much is silver up this year so far?
[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:34.940]  Oh my word.
[01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:39.722]  So just in the last four and a half, five months, we're already up 35%.
[01:45:42.011 --> 01:45:50.055]  Right, and so here's where, like the story that we talked about last time, the Samsung solid-state batteries, that's going to add so much demand for silver.
[01:45:50.535 --> 01:46:02.261]  But outside of that, industry analysts now, because of supply chain disruptions, high demand, inflationary pressures, are expecting silver to hit $50 by the end of this year.
[01:46:02.941 --> 01:46:04.563]  So we're at 30, Alex.
[01:46:04.944 --> 01:46:08.649]  So moving, that's like a 67% increase.
[01:46:09.169 --> 01:46:16.179]  Even if these economists are the dumbest people in the world and they get an F, F minus, because they only get 50% of it right, right?
[01:46:16.659 --> 01:46:20.204]  That's still over 30% growth between now and the rest of the year.
[01:46:20.905 --> 01:46:22.547]  That's incredible.
[01:46:22.627 --> 01:46:31.715]  And so when our goal is to minimize risk and maximize return, this is actually the best time in history to allocate into silver.
[01:46:32.055 --> 01:46:34.537]  I'm not saying gold and silver are the greatest things since sliced bread.
[01:46:35.178 --> 01:46:44.947]  During Trump and Reagan years, you know, it was stocks, bonds, mutual funds, those markets that actually did really well because of lowering taxes, lowering interest rates, job creation, wages were going up.
[01:46:45.487 --> 01:46:47.148]  We don't have that right now.
[01:46:47.188 --> 01:46:48.069]  We simply don't.
[01:46:48.509 --> 01:46:50.931]  So therefore, we navigate into strength.
[01:46:51.412 --> 01:46:57.456]  And now the analysts are now talking, yeah, 50 to 75 for this year.
[01:46:57.657 --> 01:46:58.717]  I used the low number.
[01:46:59.318 --> 01:47:01.259]  Next year, potentially triple digits.
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:13.247]  Because of all the military use of silver, the solar use in silver, the electric vehicle use in silver, like we talked about last week, which I think is the biggest story in the history of silver.
[01:47:13.707 --> 01:47:17.149]  If you all didn't watch that show, you should go back in the archive and watch it.
[01:47:17.489 --> 01:47:18.250]  It was incredible.
[01:47:18.930 --> 01:47:24.954]  And this is where we want to make sure, Alex, that we are in the right place at the right time, always.
[01:47:24.974 --> 01:47:27.816]  I mean, this is a no-brainer with the inflation and the industrial use.
[01:47:28.456 --> 01:47:31.258]  I want you to do five more minutes the next hour, then our special guest Steve Kersh is joining us.
[01:47:31.278 --> 01:47:40.245]  But now racing through, China on the verge of welfare state crumbles, explosions, social unrest, and youth unemployment soars, strike surge.
[01:47:40.265 --> 01:47:42.887]  That's what I was told by my sources in the Pentagon 10 years ago.
[01:47:42.907 --> 01:47:44.488]  This will start happening right about now.
[01:47:44.988 --> 01:47:49.832]  Then we've also got the new health scare they're pushing here and overseas with the UN treaty.
[01:47:50.272 --> 01:47:51.173]  Let's start getting into that.
[01:47:52.754 --> 01:48:03.958]  So when people, when the left operates through a state of fear, wants to command and control and get people to vote for them or support their policies simply out of fear.
[01:48:04.499 --> 01:48:05.919]  Pandemics is one of them.
[01:48:06.339 --> 01:48:10.681]  When we know what happened during COVID to the economy, it destroyed it.
[01:48:11.141 --> 01:48:13.182]  Mom-and-pop businesses went out of business.
[01:48:13.542 --> 01:48:15.103]  People weren't going out and spending.
[01:48:15.183 --> 01:48:16.544]  Jobs were being lost.
[01:48:16.924 --> 01:48:20.886]  Inflationary pressures were going up because they had to print their way out of it with all the stimulus.
[01:48:21.346 --> 01:48:23.467]  I mean, pandemics are bad for the economy.
[01:48:23.767 --> 01:48:27.810]  Well, what's happening in Massachusetts right now, an ultra-liberal state?
[01:48:27.850 --> 01:48:28.330]  What are they saying?
[01:48:28.670 --> 01:48:37.975]  This encephalitis virus or whatever it is, this mosquito-borne thing, they're basically curfews from six o'clock at night.
[01:48:38.655 --> 01:48:45.619]  You can't be outside doing outdoor activities until October at the earliest, and probably even after that.
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:51.543]  And they started this four and a half years ago in key liberal areas, so they're trying to roll back out the lockdowns again.
[01:48:52.897 --> 01:49:01.239]  They are, and so you also have the bird flu, which morphed into cow flu, and then you've got monkeypox, right?
[01:49:01.299 --> 01:49:06.220]  Nobody knows, well, boy, these mortality rates are 20 to 30%, we're all gonna die, right?
[01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:14.581]  So they're going to force pandemic, the pandemics are coming, they're gonna force lockdowns, shutdowns, curfews, force vaccinations, all this stuff.
[01:49:15.121 --> 01:49:17.442]  Well, the economy can't handle it this time.
[01:49:17.822 --> 01:49:27.668]  We already spent our whole WOD last time just surviving, and now they're going to bring it on us again during an election time when they're going to make every promise under the sun.
[01:49:27.708 --> 01:49:29.389]  And again, the globalists knew exactly what they were doing.
[01:49:29.429 --> 01:49:33.972]  Let's explain why they want to collapse things when we come back and hit a few final stories.
[01:49:34.112 --> 01:49:35.053]  Dr. Kirk Elliott, stay with us.
[01:49:45.799 --> 01:49:58.609]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements, because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[01:49:59.049 --> 01:50:01.251]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[01:50:02.072 --> 01:50:07.496]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[01:50:08.559 --> 01:50:17.124]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[01:50:17.464 --> 01:50:19.326]  We had five companies making product for us.
[01:50:19.946 --> 01:50:24.469]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're Infowars.
[01:50:25.169 --> 01:50:27.471]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts.
[01:50:28.451 --> 01:50:30.853]  We found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[01:50:31.233 --> 01:50:33.734]  Not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[01:50:34.555 --> 01:50:36.076]  And they said, listen, you know
[01:50:37.284 --> 01:50:53.298]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[01:50:53.659 --> 01:51:00.345]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[01:51:01.417 --> 01:51:02.719]  We're good to go.
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:21.424]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private-labeled from them before we were even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[01:51:21.504 --> 01:51:28.147]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[01:51:28.287 --> 01:51:30.788]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[01:51:30.948 --> 01:51:32.889]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[01:51:33.069 --> 01:51:42.853]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[01:51:43.474 --> 01:51:45.875]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[01:51:45.935 --> 01:51:46.995]  Take Turmeric 95.
[01:51:48.676 --> 01:51:55.379]  Turmeric 95 is called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[01:51:55.499 --> 01:52:01.141]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[01:52:01.241 --> 01:52:09.785]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[01:52:09.825 --> 01:52:11.886]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[01:52:13.533 --> 01:52:26.821]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[01:52:27.301 --> 01:52:31.704]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[01:52:31.764 --> 01:52:36.407]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[01:52:36.667 --> 01:52:37.147]  We're good to go!
[01:52:37.188 --> 01:52:37.588]  We're good to go!
[01:52:37.608 --> 01:52:38.428]  We're good to go!
[01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:39.549]  We're good to go!
[01:52:39.569 --> 01:52:40.490]  We're good to go!
[01:52:40.770 --> 01:52:41.291]  We're good to go!
[01:52:41.311 --> 01:52:41.951]  We're good to go!
[01:52:42.031 --> 01:52:42.852]  We're good to go!
[01:52:42.872 --> 01:52:43.713]  We're good to go!
[01:52:43.733 --> 01:52:44.553]  We're good to go!
[01:52:44.573 --> 01:52:44.953]  We're good to go!
[01:52:45.014 --> 01:52:45.534]  We're good to go!
[01:52:45.554 --> 01:52:46.014]  We're good to go!
[01:52:46.034 --> 01:52:46.795]  We're good to go!
[01:52:46.815 --> 01:52:47.716]  We're good to go!
[01:52:47.836 --> 01:52:48.576]  We're good to go!
[01:52:48.616 --> 01:52:49.377]  We're good to go!
[01:52:49.417 --> 01:52:50.037]  We're good to go!
[01:52:50.057 --> 01:52:50.638]  We're good to go!
[01:52:50.658 --> 01:52:51.158]  We're good to go!
[01:52:51.218 --> 01:52:51.819]  We're good to go!
[01:52:51.839 --> 01:52:53.360]  We're good to go!
[01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:54.161]  We're good to go!
[01:52:54.201 --> 01:52:55.061]  We're good to go!
[01:52:55.081 --> 01:52:56.142]  We're good to go!
[01:52:56.222 --> 01:52:56.803]  We're good to go!
[01:52:56.823 --> 01:52:57.423]  We're good to go!
[01:52:57.443 --> 01:52:57.963]  We're good to go!
[01:52:57.983 --> 01:52:58.564]  We're good to go!
[01:52:58.604 --> 01:52:59.485]  We're good to go!
[01:52:59.525 --> 01:53:00.545]  We're good to go!
[01:53:00.706 --> 01:53:01.706]  We're good to go!
[01:53:01.726 --> 01:53:02.547]  We're good to go!
[01:53:02.567 --> 01:53:03.087]  We're good to go!
[01:53:03.107 --> 01:53:04.108]  We're good to go!
[01:53:04.148 --> 01:53:05.189]  We're good to go!
[01:53:05.209 --> 01:53:05.729]  We're good to go!
[01:53:05.809 --> 01:53:05.930]  We're
[01:53:06.510 --> 01:53:06.770]  Thank you.
[01:53:35.074 --> 01:53:39.099]  Waging war on corruption, crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[01:53:39.159 --> 01:53:40.280]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:53:40.621 --> 01:53:44.485]  Steve Kirsch with massive news on the COVID vaccine poison front.
[01:53:44.926 --> 01:53:47.129]  He's a real statistician and computer guru.
[01:53:47.709 --> 01:53:50.393]  Comes up, you know, the whole MIT building's named after him.
[01:53:50.833 --> 01:53:51.554]  For those that don't know him.
[01:53:52.755 --> 01:53:53.375]  That's coming up.
[01:53:54.216 --> 01:53:57.277]  But since Dr. Kirk Elliott mentioned this, I'd like to show it to you.
[01:53:57.317 --> 01:53:59.318]  Here's CBS in Massachusetts.
[01:53:59.738 --> 01:54:00.598]  Stay in your house.
[01:54:00.638 --> 01:54:01.399]  There's a curfew.
[01:54:01.519 --> 01:54:02.759]  Oh, deadly virus everywhere.
[01:54:02.819 --> 01:54:03.759]  Oh, Fauci's sick.
[01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:05.360]  Oh, he's a victim.
[01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:07.461]  This is just so transparent.
[01:54:07.501 --> 01:54:09.822]  Here's the clip, and then Dr. Elliott's going to tell you more.
[01:54:11.437 --> 01:54:24.904]  Oxford, Massachusetts, and three neighboring towns have a reason for concern as mosquitoes carrying a potentially deadly virus called Eastern Equine Encephalitis, or EEE, infected a resident who is now fighting for his life.
[01:54:25.225 --> 01:54:28.526]  We don't want to see another human case of EEE this year.
[01:54:29.067 --> 01:54:32.068]  The rare but dangerous disease can cause swelling in the brain.
[01:54:32.148 --> 01:54:33.229]  There's no treatment.
[01:54:33.249 --> 01:54:35.110]  Same story, like COVID, we only want to have one case.
[01:54:35.550 --> 01:54:36.931]  New Zealand did that, remember?
[01:54:36.991 --> 01:54:37.511]  Not one case.
[01:54:37.531 --> 01:54:39.691]  We don't think it's women, it's predators.
[01:54:56.917 --> 01:54:58.519]  These are recommendations.
[01:54:58.579 --> 01:55:01.061]  They're not hard and stop requirements.
[01:55:01.141 --> 01:55:03.624]  And the school boards will go along with it, shut the football game down.
[01:55:03.644 --> 01:55:05.165]  Right into the school year, creating fear.
[01:55:05.185 --> 01:55:05.646]  We can't stop life.
[01:55:05.686 --> 01:55:07.007]  They need to get out there and play.
[01:55:22.182 --> 01:55:27.585]  This is their time to be social with their friends and be a part of a team.
[01:55:27.645 --> 01:55:35.108]  Now, triple E symptoms usually begin between four to ten days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.
[01:55:35.428 --> 01:55:40.671]  According to the CDC, now some of those symptoms can include fever, headache, and seizures.
[01:55:40.871 --> 01:55:41.131]  Nora?
[01:55:41.151 --> 01:55:42.732]  This is such an interesting story.
[01:55:42.752 --> 01:55:43.732]  Of course, the shots do that too.
[01:55:43.772 --> 01:55:45.113]  Thank you so much for bringing it to us.
[01:55:45.133 --> 01:55:46.473]  Not early, we've got about two and a half minutes left.
[01:55:46.514 --> 01:55:47.254]  Put bookends on this.
[01:55:48.499 --> 01:55:51.960]  All right, so pandemics, terrible for the economy.
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:56:09.847]  So what we're seeing globally, this is what Klaus Schwab said, we're going to have, and you did a great show on this the other day, we're going to have all these post-pandemic type shocks, these economic shocks, these global shocks, these health shocks, right?
[01:56:10.367 --> 01:56:12.148]  And so they're telling us what's coming.
[01:56:12.768 --> 01:56:19.870]  Well, Europe now has vaccination card program that's about to go live in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Latvia and Portugal.
[01:56:20.490 --> 01:56:27.132]  New Zealand has a new pandemic plan that's going to bring martial law and forced vaccination on people.
[01:56:27.312 --> 01:56:29.213]  If you even want to be in the country, it's like what?
[01:56:29.813 --> 01:56:40.340]  I mean, so you've got these pandemics coming, and I'm telling you what, Alex, America and the world can't survive another pandemic economically.
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:43.662]  You know, health-wise, sure, it's like, you just get over it, right?
[01:56:44.103 --> 01:56:48.365]  But economically, you can't, because we've already spent all of our money.
[01:56:48.405 --> 01:56:53.529]  The only thing left is to print our way out of it, which is going to cause massive inflation.
[01:56:54.069 --> 01:56:59.293]  So therefore, we need to actually start thinking ahead of the curve
[01:57:00.093 --> 01:57:06.318]  Allocate into something that's strong, something that does well during times of inflation.
[01:57:07.118 --> 01:57:18.046]  Because when the World Health Organization now says Mpox is a world health emergency, they now have the authority to force shutdowns, mask mandates, travel restrictions, all of that stuff.
[01:57:18.586 --> 01:57:19.727]  And they're clearly trying it.
[01:57:19.767 --> 01:57:20.687]  They're clearly trying it.
[01:57:21.608 --> 01:57:23.870]  Bird flu, Mpox, the mosquito crap.
[01:57:23.910 --> 01:57:27.172]  I mean, they are going into full fear mode with 68 days of the election.
[01:57:28.496 --> 01:57:35.802]  Yeah, and imagine a world where there's so much fear about health that they have to say, you know what, people better not even go out and vote.
[01:57:35.842 --> 01:57:38.484]  Let's just do mail-in ballots this time.
[01:57:38.544 --> 01:57:41.206]  They know how to maneuver through mail-in ballots, right?
[01:57:41.806 --> 01:57:47.971]  So, you know, the point is, though, we need to identify this and not get scared.
[01:57:48.332 --> 01:57:54.256]  We need to actually identify this, have courage, have faith, have boldness, have wisdom to do the right thing.
[01:57:54.717 --> 01:57:57.299]  This is why we bring it up, not to be fear mongers,
[01:57:57.819 --> 01:58:00.240]  But to tell what's going on in the world so we can navigate through it.
[01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:01.240]  Dr. Elliott, you're totally right.
[01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:05.421]  God gave us a sound mind so we can get ahead of this and stand against this and expose it.
[01:58:05.441 --> 01:58:07.682]  They're trying it again, but we're exposing it right now.
[01:58:07.722 --> 01:58:13.463]  People can get ready and use their brain to get silver and gold for the best place that supports the broadcast of 360WIN right now.
[01:58:13.563 --> 01:58:15.343]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:58:15.383 --> 01:58:17.224]  KEPM.com forward slash gold or 7206053900.
[01:58:17.304 --> 01:58:18.764]  Dr. Elliott, thank you so much.
[01:58:30.825 --> 01:58:31.626]  We're unbalanced!
[01:58:31.926 --> 01:58:32.887]  It's not fair!
[01:58:37.991 --> 01:58:41.595]  I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires.
[01:58:42.055 --> 01:58:50.142]  We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong in dark rooms glued to their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials.
[01:58:50.562 --> 01:58:54.166]  Well, I think... NBC, you are here to listen and not speak.
[01:58:55.547 --> 01:58:57.469]  I think we should go with a good old-fashioned public health scare.
[01:58:57.709 --> 01:58:57.889]  Yeah.
[01:58:59.252 --> 01:58:59.912]  A new disease.
[01:59:00.153 --> 01:59:00.793]  No one's immune.
[01:59:01.093 --> 01:59:04.375]  It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic.
[01:59:04.555 --> 01:59:06.257]  And instead of summer, it's all the time.
[01:59:06.937 --> 01:59:11.000]  Now I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves.
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:12.721]  He loves being that guy.
[01:59:12.801 --> 01:59:15.242]  But Janice, we do have standards.
[01:59:15.462 --> 01:59:17.164]  This can't be a made-up disease.
[01:59:17.424 --> 01:59:21.747]  The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.
[01:59:21.927 --> 01:59:25.329]  We do have something we've been holding on to, but it hasn't been tested.
[01:59:25.689 --> 01:59:26.590]  Get over here, NBC.
[01:59:28.772 --> 01:59:32.216]  Well, we certainly believe in testing, but I... Oh.
[01:59:34.639 --> 01:59:34.919]  Wow.
[01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:35.900]  Wow.
[01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:37.061]  Oh, yeah.
[01:59:37.101 --> 01:59:38.823]  So, we've got our deadly disease.
[01:59:39.244 --> 01:59:43.508]  Now we just have to blame it on something that's in every household.
[01:59:43.668 --> 01:59:46.051]  Something that people are a little bit afraid of already.
[01:59:46.454 --> 01:59:48.736]  House cat flu is coming, people.
[01:59:48.937 --> 01:59:56.444]  The Center for Disease Disinformation predicts with some degree of probability that the house cat flu might spread in the following hypothetical outbreak pattern.
[01:59:58.126 --> 02:00:03.731]  So petter beware, that warm body on your lap just might be ready to destroy your tender vittles.
[02:00:10.171 --> 02:00:14.832]  Springfielders are advised to stay tuned for more information if they experience any of the following symptoms.
[02:00:15.092 --> 02:00:18.113]  Mild thirst, occasional hunger, tiredness at night.
[02:00:19.633 --> 02:00:22.794]  You know, I don't know when this was ever a good idea.
[02:00:31.836 --> 02:00:32.636]  Hurry up, boy!
[02:00:32.716 --> 02:00:37.317]  We have to burn everything the cat touched before the virus makes us paranoid!
[02:00:39.727 --> 02:00:43.869]  Well, Steve Kirsch is a hero, an unsung hero.
[02:00:44.389 --> 02:00:52.293]  He is a tech guru, titan, super successful, got buildings at major universities like MIT named after him.
[02:00:52.794 --> 02:00:58.497]  And for decades, he's been a major philanthropist standing up for the people's rights on so many massive issues.
[02:00:58.577 --> 02:01:07.301]  And now, for four years, very early on, has been exposing the whole COVID power grab, the origin of the virus, the poison shots, and more.
[02:01:07.341 --> 02:01:07.962]  And he's really
[02:01:08.982 --> 02:01:25.765]  But on the front lines, like earlier this year and last year, when New Zealand's top statistician, the only guy that had access to all the databases, released the data, protected the names, and showed that it was the people taking the shots dying at massive levels, the government of New Zealand came after Kirsch.
[02:01:26.506 --> 02:01:28.746]  So this is serious stuff he's involved in.
[02:01:28.786 --> 02:01:29.866]  That's just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:01:29.906 --> 02:01:31.147]  And, you know, he doesn't want praise.
[02:01:31.167 --> 02:01:33.027]  We need to understand this guy's been fighting
[02:01:34.195 --> 02:01:38.019]  Really hard, and we need to appreciate people like him and hold them up because they get targeted.
[02:01:38.039 --> 02:01:41.522]  People like Dr. Malone and Dr. Yidan and just so many others.
[02:01:42.363 --> 02:01:48.769]  Steve Kerch is the philanthropist and executive director of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund, where we try to get real treatment to folks and save a lot of lives.
[02:01:49.109 --> 02:01:50.591]  The Vaccine Safety Research Foundation.
[02:01:50.931 --> 02:01:55.476]  He is the inventor of the optical mouse and one of the first internet search engines, InfoSeek.
[02:01:55.896 --> 02:01:57.778]  He has founded seven, and of course more by now,
[02:01:58.098 --> 02:02:00.779]  High-tech companies with $2 billion market caps.
[02:02:01.119 --> 02:02:05.041]  Steve is currently focused on safe and effective ways to do what he did in the fake pandemic.
[02:02:05.321 --> 02:02:06.501]  He received his B.S., M.S.
[02:02:06.541 --> 02:02:08.622]  in electrical engineering, computer science from M.I.T.
[02:02:08.702 --> 02:02:08.902]  in 1980.
[02:02:09.022 --> 02:02:20.806]  He's also featured 60 Minutes for his work on funding fluvoxamine, one of the first repurposed drugs to be shown in phase three clinical trials, designed to reduce the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID.
[02:02:21.106 --> 02:02:22.027]  SteveKirsch.com.
[02:02:23.044 --> 02:02:29.606]  Or stevekirsch.substack.com, stevekirsch.substack.com on Twitter at ST Kirsch and on Gab at ST Kirsch.
[02:02:29.926 --> 02:02:33.108]  And he joins us right now to cover the massive developments.
[02:02:33.588 --> 02:02:41.911]  I mean, he said this years ago, but now the actuaries, the government numbers, the Harvard-backed studies, almost all the new heart problems and cardiovascular, the shots.
[02:02:42.351 --> 02:02:45.972]  I mean, and they're now admitting this, but back of the newspaper.
[02:02:46.652 --> 02:02:48.053]  Meanwhile, he sent me all these new articles.
[02:02:49.153 --> 02:02:55.778]  He's written at Substack, US, UK, Denmark, Finland, Norway, cumulative excess deaths kept rising after the shots rolled out.
[02:02:56.199 --> 02:03:00.262]  A summary of why the Czech Republic data is devastating to the safe and effective narrative.
[02:03:00.322 --> 02:03:05.246]  A novel practical approach for directly assessing COVID-19 vaccine efficacy amongst hospitalization.
[02:03:06.247 --> 02:03:08.208]  Stunning confessions of an army doctor.
[02:03:08.228 --> 02:03:10.050]  I mean you've got the
[02:03:12.293 --> 02:03:15.998]  Major military surgeons and doctors saying they've seen a 900 plus percent increase.
[02:03:16.558 --> 02:03:19.262]  You got Norway and excess deaths aren't driven by COVID shots.
[02:03:19.642 --> 02:03:22.546]  What's causing the unexpected increase?
[02:03:22.606 --> 02:03:24.788]  And so we've got all these graphs, all this info.
[02:03:25.049 --> 02:03:28.373]  They're trying to roll out the bird flu, the mpox, monkeypox, the...
[02:03:29.514 --> 02:03:32.796]  It's almost hard to know where to start, but I think I'll start with, um,
[02:03:52.691 --> 02:03:56.253]  I had a discussion recently with Tom Jefferson.
[02:03:56.893 --> 02:04:02.835]  And Tom Jefferson is one of the titans of evidence-based medicine.
[02:04:03.556 --> 02:04:08.058]  And people who know him would tell you that this guy's a scientist's scientist.
[02:04:08.098 --> 02:04:09.678]  He's just impeccable.
[02:04:09.698 --> 02:04:11.519]  He's very hard to get a hold of.
[02:04:12.019 --> 02:04:16.941]  And I was honored to be able to talk to him for about an hour or so in a private conversation.
[02:04:17.462 --> 02:04:18.602]  And I asked him the question.
[02:04:19.122 --> 02:04:20.223]  I said, you know, Tom,
[02:04:21.403 --> 02:04:32.810]  I've got this bet with the guy in Israel, and I bet that the vaccines have killed more people than they saved, and I wanted to get your take on it.
[02:04:33.390 --> 02:04:36.872]  And he gave me an answer, which I kind of didn't expect him to give me.
[02:04:37.252 --> 02:04:39.654]  And he said, well, we don't really know.
[02:04:40.692 --> 02:04:42.613]  And I said, what do you mean we don't really know?
[02:04:42.653 --> 02:04:44.833]  He said, well, they're hiding the data.
[02:04:45.134 --> 02:04:46.654]  They won't show us the data.
[02:04:47.074 --> 02:04:57.578]  And he talked about, in fact, a committee of Parliament which expressly asked their Office of National Statistics
[02:04:58.158 --> 02:05:02.882]  And the reason for the denial is it was company confidential.
[02:05:18.576 --> 02:05:21.998]  Meaning it's Pfizer confidential or it's Moderna confidential.
[02:05:22.458 --> 02:05:35.464]  And he said, basically, that when the authorities are hiding the data to be able to make an assessment of safety or lack thereof, then you really have a problematic situation.
[02:05:35.824 --> 02:05:46.229]  Look, you know, it seems pretty obvious to anybody who's a clear thinker on this, a critical thinker, that
[02:05:47.069 --> 02:05:56.031]  If the vaccines were perfectly safe and effective, why would the governments need to hide the data from people like Tom Jefferson and other scientists?
[02:05:56.471 --> 02:06:00.732]  And that's exactly what we have here, that they're hiding the data.
[02:06:01.132 --> 02:06:12.594]  And I told him, I said, you know, Tom, I recently got a dump from the Czech Republic, and I got record level data from the Czech Republic.
[02:06:12.954 --> 02:06:15.835]  This is the first time in world history
[02:06:16.428 --> 02:06:22.513]  That we have record-level data on a vaccine from any government anywhere in the world ever.
[02:06:23.694 --> 02:06:31.880]  And so I analyzed that data and I found that Moderna was much more deadly than Pfizer.
[02:06:31.900 --> 02:06:32.021]  And so
[02:06:35.713 --> 02:06:36.935]  We couldn't figure out.
[02:06:37.155 --> 02:06:42.942]  It was a very clear comparison.
[02:06:43.523 --> 02:06:51.594]  What we did is we looked at mortality rates if you got the Pfizer shot versus mortality rates if you got the Moderna shot and you're exactly the same age.
[02:06:52.174 --> 02:06:58.300]  And these shots were not, there was no systematic or systemic bias in the distribution of the shots.
[02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:01.042]  You were pretty much assigned a brand randomly.
[02:07:01.443 --> 02:07:10.411]  So, if the vaccines are all the same safety, then you'd expect that the mortality rate one year out from the shot would be the same for all the brands.
[02:07:11.016 --> 02:07:12.557]  And we found that it wasn't.
[02:07:12.637 --> 02:07:19.780]  In fact, Moderna was high, and it was high not just in times of COVID, but also in times of non-COVID.
[02:07:20.181 --> 02:07:23.842]  It was the same increase in all-cause mortality.
[02:07:24.183 --> 02:07:34.248]  So it clearly showed that the Moderna shots were far deadlier, you know, 10% or more, depending on what age you were, than the Pfizer shots.
[02:07:34.808 --> 02:07:40.631]  And so even if Pfizer was a perfectly safe vaccine, Moderna should be immediately halted worldwide.
[02:07:41.438 --> 02:07:46.121]  But the Czech officials totally ignored the analysis.
[02:07:46.542 --> 02:07:48.083]  They don't have any explanation for it.
[02:07:48.663 --> 02:07:52.365]  And the press in the Czech Republic also ignored this.
[02:07:52.786 --> 02:07:58.349]  So people are ignoring the data that we have that is definitive.
[02:07:58.749 --> 02:08:07.035]  That's the very rare event where we actually have definitive data and nobody wants to talk about it.
[02:08:07.583 --> 02:08:15.609]  And there is no statistician, there is no epidemiologist in the world who will look at that data and say, Oh, these vaccines are perfectly safe.
[02:08:16.810 --> 02:08:17.870]  It's just not going to happen.
[02:08:17.890 --> 02:08:27.877]  They're just going to ignore it because it shows that it clearly shows because this is record level gold standard data doesn't get any better than this data.
[02:08:28.318 --> 02:08:31.640]  It shows that the vaccines have been killing people.
[02:08:32.279 --> 02:08:44.720]  Now, there's another way that you can also get to the same conclusion, and it's easier for people to understand, and that's if you talk to an Army doctor, which I did last night.
[02:08:45.265 --> 02:08:58.696]  And I talked to this doctor who said that he or she would like to remain nameless because they're afraid of losing their pensions and being dishonorably discharged and so forth.
[02:08:59.077 --> 02:09:08.284]  So I can't say who it was, but I can put you in touch with him or her and you can verify.
[02:09:08.304 --> 02:09:11.067]  Well, do you remember, just to interrupt and then start over, because I don't mean interrupt,
[02:09:12.808 --> 02:09:24.095]  The officer, Macy, in the Air Force, he had the internal documents, and they were finding, what, 96% increase in heart failure in young pilots, and it was grounding their force.
[02:09:24.795 --> 02:09:25.496]  That was a year ago.
[02:09:25.516 --> 02:09:25.816]  Oh, yeah.
[02:09:26.496 --> 02:09:29.358]  Oh, and this is, what I heard was an earful.
[02:09:29.998 --> 02:09:32.760]  I heard, and this doctor,
[02:09:33.522 --> 02:09:36.404]  This army doctor went on for over an hour.
[02:09:36.464 --> 02:09:38.226]  And start over with his name, because I interrupted you.
[02:09:38.286 --> 02:09:38.706]  I'm sorry.
[02:09:38.846 --> 02:09:39.227]  Start over.
[02:09:39.487 --> 02:09:40.568]  Yeah.
[02:09:40.748 --> 02:09:58.522]  So, but the bottom line is that, I won't go through all of the detail, but the high-level response from this doctor was, I don't know if I, hopefully, I should have put this on no interrupt.
[02:09:58.822 --> 02:09:59.403]  No, no, you're here.
[02:09:59.443 --> 02:10:00.544]  I'm not interrupting.
[02:10:00.564 --> 02:10:00.964]  Keep going.
[02:10:03.309 --> 02:10:17.804]  The response from this doctor was that I have seen more medical incidents in the last two years than I would expect to see in a lifetime.
[02:10:19.042 --> 02:10:19.182]  Wow.
[02:10:49.432 --> 02:10:50.393]  in a day.
[02:10:50.413 --> 02:10:56.158]  He's seen 10 strokes among these.
[02:10:57.980 --> 02:11:00.562]  These are our kids.
[02:11:00.602 --> 02:11:03.545]  These are, you know, like 19-year-olds who are perfectly healthy.
[02:11:03.565 --> 02:11:06.128]  They come into the army and they're decimated.
[02:11:06.548 --> 02:11:09.991]  Three of the kids, they lost their vision.
[02:11:10.031 --> 02:11:12.934]  This is out of 4,000 under this doctor's purview.
[02:11:13.504 --> 02:11:17.426]  Three of the 4,000 went blind.
[02:11:18.247 --> 02:11:20.248]  And these are active kids.
[02:11:20.308 --> 02:11:24.930]  These are kids who are rock climbers, who are doing all sorts of sports activities.
[02:11:25.491 --> 02:11:36.117]  And now, he talked about one kid, 19-year-old, who's now legally blind after these vaccine shots.
[02:11:36.997 --> 02:11:39.779]  And so he's now permanently disabled.
[02:11:40.882 --> 02:11:48.438]  And he gets $2,000 a month from the Army for the rest of his life because of his disability.
[02:11:49.252 --> 02:11:54.675]  They basically destroyed his life and they're giving him $2,000 a month.
[02:11:55.016 --> 02:12:06.883]  Now, I talked to this doctor and the doctor said that, you know, and the doctor said, oh, and I predicted that there would be a heart attack in one of our pilots piloting the plane because these things are happening way too often.
[02:12:07.323 --> 02:12:11.226]  And two weeks later, there was a heart attack just like I predicted.
[02:12:12.046 --> 02:12:18.090]  And, you know, to some extent, you can't predict exactly when, but then this general
[02:12:18.945 --> 02:12:25.607]  Who this doctor reports to said, OK, I trust you now because you predicted something that never happens.
[02:12:26.327 --> 02:12:27.848]  It never happens in the army.
[02:12:28.428 --> 02:12:29.328]  And you predicted it.
[02:12:29.628 --> 02:12:31.689]  And it happened right after your prediction.
[02:12:32.289 --> 02:12:33.589]  So he said, you got my attention.
[02:12:34.430 --> 02:12:37.591]  And so the doctor told him the whole story.
[02:12:37.931 --> 02:12:39.831]  And this general said, hey, thanks very much.
[02:12:40.291 --> 02:12:45.173]  But I'm unable to really escalate this because I don't want to lose my job.
[02:12:46.713 --> 02:12:48.574]  And so this is what's going on here.
[02:12:48.614 --> 02:13:04.782]  These people are realizing that we're destroying the lives of these people who go into the military, and it's going to be hell for recruitment, you know, when you treat people this way.
[02:13:09.298 --> 02:13:15.022]  They had five people on the base die due to these COVID shots.
[02:13:15.503 --> 02:13:19.826]  And it would have been seven, but two of them were resuscitated from the dead.
[02:13:20.446 --> 02:13:29.833]  So you're talking about upwards of seven kids, you know, 19, 20-year-olds out of 4,000.
[02:13:30.533 --> 02:13:33.355]  That's almost a 2% death rate.
[02:13:33.415 --> 02:13:34.576]  Sorry, a 0.2% death rate.
[02:13:38.539 --> 02:13:46.600]  Which is absolutely shocking to see in a very healthy cohort like this.
[02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:48.081]  This is unheard of.
[02:13:48.661 --> 02:13:53.882]  And so you don't have to go through all of these studies and the statistics and all that.
[02:13:54.742 --> 02:14:07.184]  All Joe Biden had to do was pick up the phone and talk to an army doctor who would tell him exactly what's going on in the healthiest people on earth.
[02:14:08.189 --> 02:14:20.398]  After they got the shots and Joe Biden would have heard an earful and it's it's distressing to me that these people who are in these leadership positions.
[02:14:21.207 --> 02:14:32.911]  Are not calling the people on the front lines to actually understand whether these shots are safe and effective or whether they're the most destructive vaccines in human history.
[02:14:33.351 --> 02:14:38.613]  And I can tell you that this doctor that I talked about was unambiguous about that question.
[02:14:40.271 --> 02:14:58.302]  So incredible and then as you're speaking I think about the countless doctors and coroners and undertakers and nurses and oncologists that are prestigious many of them many just you know random people with good practices you look them up they got four and a half stars and they're like I've been I've been running my cancer
[02:14:59.690 --> 02:15:01.411]  What is it in the shots that's doing this?
[02:15:20.715 --> 02:15:27.564]  Well, it's the fact that the shots are effectively very disruptive.
[02:15:27.584 --> 02:15:28.905]  They're very irritating.
[02:15:29.847 --> 02:15:34.673]  They cause inflammation and they cause autoimmunity.
[02:15:35.073 --> 02:15:38.217]  And so when the shots, these mRNA shots, go into people,
[02:15:38.337 --> 02:15:39.078]  We're good.
[02:16:01.872 --> 02:16:26.065]  And so what's happening is people are dying and I'm talking to other physicians as well who are seeing you know five five per thousand dead is is the typical number if you have a you know all age cohort it's 25 per thousand if you have a geriatric cohort where it's very old people but if you have a range of people it's on the order of five people per thousand
[02:16:26.525 --> 02:16:29.786]  Why does it hurt people that are in such great shape?
[02:16:29.886 --> 02:16:33.526]  The statistics I've seen, you're even more apt to have these.
[02:16:33.827 --> 02:16:39.588]  Is it that the heart is already in such good shape it just can't handle it, or what's happening?
[02:16:56.417 --> 02:17:08.602]  No, it's because they have higher testosterone levels and they're putting stress more often, which secretes the hormones that cause the heart to be under stress.
[02:17:08.682 --> 02:17:19.746]  And when the heart's under stress, there are a combination of effects that make it more likely... So the heart's already damaged, they don't know it, they go out and do what they regularly do, boom, they're dead.
[02:17:20.871 --> 02:17:26.316]  Boom, boom, they have cardiac arrest and often that ends up in death.
[02:17:26.677 --> 02:17:36.406]  People, you know, when I talk to doctors directly and ask why their patients are dying and how do they know it's the vaccine, they'll talk about pervo cancers.
[02:17:36.726 --> 02:17:43.653]  They'll talk about people who were scanned, they don't have any health conditions at all, no cancers, no sign of anything.
[02:17:44.173 --> 02:17:47.917]  And then two months later, they're in stage four cancer.
[02:17:48.117 --> 02:17:58.106]  This is what's referred to as turbo cancer because it's basically not there before the shots and then within months,
[02:18:01.088 --> 02:18:01.488]  Thank you.
[02:18:22.459 --> 02:18:23.299]  We're good to go.
[02:18:46.794 --> 02:18:56.683]  He said that this person had like, you know, two of these conditions when it would be extremely rare to find someone with just one of the conditions.
[02:18:57.103 --> 02:19:04.390]  And so that's giving you an idea of just how devastating these shots have been.
[02:19:04.850 --> 02:19:18.113]  And then we can see it, of course, in the larger numbers when we look at the large data and I've been playing around on the mortality.watch site on the internet.
[02:19:19.272 --> 02:19:27.623]  It's a great site because you can look at data all different ways if you know how to use the tools there, which I just recently learned how to use.
[02:19:28.364 --> 02:19:31.809]  And it's phenomenal the kinds of data you can mine.
[02:19:31.849 --> 02:19:35.514]  So I was looking at cumulative excess deaths.
[02:19:36.375 --> 02:19:45.599]  And what I was seeing is the cumulative excess deaths were flatlined and then COVID rolled out and then, you know, it started going up.
[02:19:45.839 --> 02:19:51.962]  But then it started continuously going up ever since then after the vaccines rolled out.
[02:19:52.722 --> 02:19:55.184]  And so this is very troubling.
[02:19:55.805 --> 02:20:04.033]  It shows that the medical interventions that we have put into place are causing harm.
[02:20:04.373 --> 02:20:06.335]  They're not stopping the problem.
[02:20:06.796 --> 02:20:10.960]  They're either basically not stopping the problem or they're fueling the fire.
[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:21.847]  And so all these interventions that we're doing are not making things better, because if things are getting better, then these excess mortality curves start to turn around and they start to go down.
[02:20:22.327 --> 02:20:29.091]  And what we're seeing is a monotonic increase in the excess all-cause mortality.
[02:20:29.612 --> 02:20:31.293]  And that's very troubling.
[02:20:31.793 --> 02:20:38.116]  It says that whatever we're doing isn't working, and that we're probably fueling the fire.
[02:20:38.596 --> 02:20:42.377]  Because if it was just COVID, you would see COVID always comes in waves.
[02:20:42.797 --> 02:20:46.619]  There's this wave, and the next wave, and the next wave, and you could see it.
[02:20:47.379 --> 02:20:54.341]  Uh, when you go to our world and data and you can see the spikes when COVID spikes and then months go by and then you see another spike and so forth.
[02:20:54.661 --> 02:21:00.782]  But you see these all-cause mortality curves, they just go up and you're like almost a perfectly straight line.
[02:21:01.482 --> 02:21:03.183]  Um, it's, it's wild.
[02:21:03.563 --> 02:21:09.484]  And if you look at like- And we see the graphs around the world, whenever the shots start, because different countries roll them out different times.
[02:21:10.144 --> 02:21:10.904]  I've seen the graphs.
[02:21:10.984 --> 02:21:13.425]  It's just perfectly right when they start, it just starts going up.
[02:21:15.401 --> 02:21:19.284]  Yeah, it goes up a little bit when COVID hit.
[02:21:20.205 --> 02:21:22.306]  Those excess mortality goes up.
[02:21:22.806 --> 02:21:27.610]  But if it's a natural virus, what happens is that the excess mortality goes down.
[02:21:27.650 --> 02:21:33.454]  It goes into negative excess mortality, which then causes the curve to go back to zero.
[02:21:33.534 --> 02:21:42.001]  But wasn't a lot of that lack of treatment, because you were spearheaded exposing this, lack of therapeutics and lack of treatment early on, wasn't that most of the deaths?
[02:21:44.002 --> 02:21:47.205]  Well, yes, you know, a bunch of it was, right?
[02:21:47.225 --> 02:21:54.451]  Because we know that COVID is very treatable if you give people these repurposed drugs that the FDA says that you shouldn't use, like ivermectin.
[02:21:54.751 --> 02:22:06.080]  You know, anybody can go to the treat early, or I think it's not treat early, it's early... Detection.
[02:22:06.961 --> 02:22:09.363]  Catch it in time.
[02:22:09.443 --> 02:22:10.384]  I'm blanking on the name.
[02:22:10.464 --> 02:22:10.764]  It's a...
[02:22:13.923 --> 02:22:16.806]  Uh, it's like early, uh, I forget.
[02:22:17.187 --> 02:22:18.368]  You'll remember during the break.
[02:22:18.408 --> 02:22:19.369]  Steve Kerr, stay there.
[02:22:19.709 --> 02:22:21.871]  I want to come back, because you're the expert at going through numbers.
[02:22:22.712 --> 02:22:28.678]  Finish up with the numbers and all these Substack articles you wrote that you sent me, but then I want to just ask you as a citizen, as a human, as a person,
[02:22:29.739 --> 02:22:32.540]  How is it going for the Fauci's and Bill Gates's and all of them?
[02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:37.202]  We have Zuckerberg coming out two days ago distancing himself, saying, I was pressured to do all this.
[02:22:37.282 --> 02:22:38.203]  I feel bad about it.
[02:22:38.643 --> 02:22:41.004]  Covering up the COVID, covering up election meddling.
[02:22:41.524 --> 02:22:42.845]  What does that signify?
[02:22:43.885 --> 02:22:46.146]  Now we've got even the establishment turning against Kamala.
[02:22:46.166 --> 02:22:47.587]  The New York Times calling her an idiot.
[02:22:48.247 --> 02:22:50.048]  CNN saying she's shallow.
[02:22:50.068 --> 02:22:55.690]  I mean, because a lot of this ties into a lot of people in the system seem to be heading for the exits right now.
[02:22:56.170 --> 02:23:03.573]  And how is the establishment from your research handling the fact that the vast majority of people know the shots are deadly and know they lied to them?
[02:23:03.613 --> 02:23:04.673]  So what is the fallout?
[02:23:05.453 --> 02:23:09.115]  And how do we stop them launching their next scaredemic pandemic?
[02:23:09.475 --> 02:23:10.515]  Steve Kersh is our guest.
[02:23:10.535 --> 02:23:11.015]  Stay with us.
[02:23:11.836 --> 02:23:12.716]  Nitric Boost.
[02:23:13.656 --> 02:23:14.116]  Turmeric 95.
[02:23:16.388 --> 02:23:19.290]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[02:23:20.251 --> 02:23:25.235]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[02:23:25.735 --> 02:23:32.900]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[02:23:33.441 --> 02:23:35.442]  They let us private label their products.
[02:23:35.462 --> 02:23:36.323]  That's why you've already heard of
[02:23:37.193 --> 02:23:38.234]  Bodies Old Turmeric Formula?
[02:23:38.554 --> 02:23:41.295]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[02:23:41.555 --> 02:23:42.856]  This is just their brand of that.
[02:23:43.216 --> 02:23:46.498]  And so, it is available under Turmeric 95.
[02:23:46.898 --> 02:23:47.518]  That's the name.
[02:23:47.778 --> 02:23:54.241]  So, we're sold out of Bodies, but we have Turmeric 95 that is, again, the same concentrated turmeric.
[02:23:54.481 --> 02:23:55.522]  Same thing with Nitric Boost.
[02:23:55.982 --> 02:23:57.603]  Nitric Boost came from this company.
[02:23:57.623 --> 02:23:59.644]  They even let us use their name.
[02:23:59.924 --> 02:24:00.925]  It's now our best seller.
[02:24:01.145 --> 02:24:02.125]  We sold out of our version.
[02:24:02.405 --> 02:24:03.846]  Their version has a white model.
[02:24:04.186 --> 02:24:05.567]  It's the exact same thing.
[02:24:06.107 --> 02:24:07.707]  You get it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:24:07.947 --> 02:24:10.508]  So check out InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:24:11.508 --> 02:24:14.809]  C19Early.org, that's the website he was thinking of.
[02:24:15.289 --> 02:24:20.850]  All right, Steve Kersh probably covered 10% of his info, so I'm going to try to just sit back and not talk too much.
[02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:21.691]  This guy's so smart.
[02:24:22.291 --> 02:24:29.693]  I know people are listening to this because he's really a scientist and a researcher and is nailing the facts here, but I have some political questions as well I want him to answer.
[02:24:30.233 --> 02:24:31.253]  Then we'll drill into all of it.
[02:24:32.045 --> 02:24:35.468]  But look, there's court cases being won that they knew Ivermectin helped.
[02:24:35.508 --> 02:24:36.089]  They blocked it.
[02:24:36.489 --> 02:24:37.330]  Cold-blooded, folks.
[02:24:37.810 --> 02:24:41.193]  FDA's lawyer admits agency's war against Ivermectin was a mistake.
[02:24:41.573 --> 02:24:43.955]  Abuse of authority after Dr. Sue government and win.
[02:24:44.616 --> 02:24:45.617]  That's Project Veritas.
[02:24:45.637 --> 02:24:48.699]  So they're still doing some good work after the stupid move to get rid of...
[02:24:49.620 --> 02:24:51.821]  The great James O'Keefe, but there's that.
[02:24:51.841 --> 02:24:54.122]  Then we've got all those other big Substack articles.
[02:24:54.162 --> 02:24:57.603]  We've got the COVID novel therapy injection was a catalyst.
[02:24:58.144 --> 02:24:59.344]  New studies of causing death.
[02:25:00.845 --> 02:25:10.869]  But first, answering the big political question, separating from the numbers, the facts, and just how insane this all is and how horrible this genocide is.
[02:25:11.909 --> 02:25:16.271]  How is the political class and the people that are guilty of this, Nuremberg 2.0,
[02:25:18.232 --> 02:25:19.233]  How are they responding?
[02:25:19.273 --> 02:25:21.173]  How would you describe their political position right now?
[02:25:21.193 --> 02:25:40.661]  Because it looks to me, with Bill Gates' wife leaving him, and Warren Buffett dumping stock in these companies, and Fauci hiding out, and massive exodus, and doctors blowing the whistle, and calls for their arrest, and as I said, Zuckerberg coming out and saying, they told me to lie, and told me to do all this, and told me to deceive about COVID-19.
[02:25:41.022 --> 02:25:44.083]  I mean, this looks like rushing to the exits now, Steve Kirsch.
[02:25:46.235 --> 02:25:52.496]  Well, it's not quite rushing to the exits, I would say, compared to what it will be in the future.
[02:25:53.037 --> 02:25:58.758]  But, you know, the first rule of holes is that when you find yourself in one, stop digging.
[02:25:59.158 --> 02:26:03.139]  Now, the Democrats, by and large, haven't figured this out yet.
[02:26:03.519 --> 02:26:11.121]  You know, Kamala, she requires her staff that works on her campaign to be vaccinated.
[02:26:11.801 --> 02:26:12.701]  This is worse
[02:26:13.314 --> 02:26:19.550]  Ben, the United States military, in the United States military today, you do not have to be vaccinated.
[02:26:19.570 --> 02:26:21.575]  You can refuse the COVID vaccine.
[02:26:22.299 --> 02:26:28.460]  If you work on the Harris campaign, you cannot work on the Harris campaign unless you're up to date.
[02:26:28.921 --> 02:26:31.401]  I mean, this is draconian.
[02:26:31.901 --> 02:26:35.422]  They should not be telling people what to put in their bodies.
[02:26:35.762 --> 02:26:37.823]  And they should not be silencing people.
[02:26:38.263 --> 02:26:42.964]  And, you know, the Democrats are continuing on with the same old narrative.
[02:26:43.664 --> 02:26:47.007]  Let's use censorship to silence the opposition.
[02:26:47.467 --> 02:26:49.149]  Let's not have any open debate.
[02:26:50.029 --> 02:26:52.371]  We're not willing to hear from the other side.
[02:26:53.212 --> 02:27:01.579]  We all know that Bobby Kennedy reached out to both the Harris campaign and the Trump campaign.
[02:27:02.060 --> 02:27:09.106]  And in the Harris campaign, they refused to even have a meeting with Robert F. Kennedy to really understand his position.
[02:27:09.146 --> 02:27:10.767]  So they're desperately stonewalling.
[02:27:10.907 --> 02:27:11.868]  They're desperately stonewalling.
[02:27:12.677 --> 02:27:29.567]  Yeah, I mean, this to me is troubling because, you know, the only way that we're going to bridge the divide, the only way we're going to heal America, and the only way we're going to come in as one nation under God is to go and we need to talk.
[02:27:29.687 --> 02:27:32.629]  We need to have a dialogue with people that we disagree with.
[02:27:33.229 --> 02:27:41.534]  And so when you have top leaders who are not willing to engage in any kind of dialogue with people on the other side,
[02:27:42.274 --> 02:27:44.616]  That is extremely troubling to me.
[02:27:45.196 --> 02:27:56.643]  And you know, to look at the contrast, when Bobby Kennedy reached out to Trump, he got a call back within minutes, and this is within hours after Trump was shot.
[02:27:57.483 --> 02:28:02.226]  That Bobby Kennedy was able to get a call with Trump almost instantly.
[02:28:02.887 --> 02:28:08.631]  And he's completely rebuffed in even having a conversation with the Harris campaign.
[02:28:09.011 --> 02:28:11.252]  No possibility of any conversation.
[02:28:11.612 --> 02:28:15.435]  And that's the fundamental, you know, I used to be a big time Democrat.
[02:28:15.455 --> 02:28:16.536]  I was supporting the Democrats.
[02:28:16.596 --> 02:28:21.099]  I gave millions, like tens of millions of dollars to the Democratic Party.
[02:28:21.579 --> 02:28:27.063]  And my eyes have been opened here about these people are not willing
[02:28:27.683 --> 02:28:32.265]  To engage in any serious discussion with people that they disagree with.
[02:28:32.565 --> 02:28:36.406]  And this is fundamentally very, very destructive.
[02:28:36.506 --> 02:28:37.166]  It's very dangerous.
[02:28:37.206 --> 02:28:38.127]  Let me just interrupt for this.
[02:28:38.407 --> 02:28:47.470]  They admit that it has been three years, almost three years, since the president talked to Putin and no one's talking to the Russians.
[02:28:48.590 --> 02:28:49.471]  Where's the red phone?
[02:28:49.511 --> 02:28:51.231]  Kennedy should talk to Khrushchev almost every day.
[02:28:51.331 --> 02:28:51.912]  That is dangerous.
[02:28:54.011 --> 02:28:54.591]  Absolutely.
[02:28:55.071 --> 02:28:55.671]  No, absolutely.
[02:28:55.711 --> 02:29:03.493]  You know, you're only going to bridge the divide of people with different views through dialogue.
[02:29:04.093 --> 02:29:12.954]  So we have a Biden administration, which is basically trying to censor and de-platform people that they disagree with.
[02:29:13.474 --> 02:29:17.435]  That is not the way you solve the misinformation problem.
[02:29:17.895 --> 02:29:21.716]  You resolve the misinformation problems through dialogue.
[02:29:21.736 --> 02:29:22.136]  Let's have a
[02:29:22.176 --> 02:29:22.736]  And your experience
[02:29:51.741 --> 02:29:52.706]  What does that mean, Steve?
[02:29:54.138 --> 02:29:57.521]  It means that they can't justify their position.
[02:29:57.961 --> 02:29:59.382]  It means they're hiding something.
[02:29:59.702 --> 02:30:09.509]  Whenever people are censoring people that they disagree with, it means that they're afraid of open debate and don't want to talk about the question.
[02:30:10.050 --> 02:30:23.240]  Even someone like Paul Offit, who claims that he's just a scientist and he wants to follow the science, I have reached out to Paul Offit through intermediaries since he won't take my calls directly, and he refuses
[02:30:24.504 --> 02:30:37.950]  And then I saw a video of him where he was approached by the producers of Vaxxed, which is a movie talking about the other side of the picture, the harms caused by the vaccine.
[02:30:38.411 --> 02:30:43.533]  And Paul Offit was asked, hey, would you like to appear in our movie?
[02:30:43.553 --> 02:30:45.034]  We'd like to ask you some questions.
[02:30:45.054 --> 02:30:49.055]  You can explain your point of view and defend your point of view.
[02:30:49.396 --> 02:30:51.056]  And he basically said, fuck you.
[02:30:51.076 --> 02:30:51.497]  Wow.
[02:30:52.877 --> 02:30:53.798]  And Steve, we've now got...
[02:31:09.614 --> 02:31:14.160]  We've now got the former head of Google, Schmidt, Eric Schmidt.
[02:31:14.180 --> 02:31:15.101]  We've got Hotez.
[02:31:15.141 --> 02:31:21.429]  We've got the UN officials saying they want NATO and the UN to suppress people's speech and maybe even send in troops.
[02:31:21.770 --> 02:31:23.312]  I mean, this is getting apocalyptic.
[02:31:23.332 --> 02:31:24.654]  This is getting megalomaniacal.
[02:31:26.260 --> 02:31:27.101]  Yeah, you can't.
[02:31:27.421 --> 02:31:33.566]  Look, anytime you're trying to suppress any kind of speech, it means you're on the wrong side of the issue.
[02:31:33.806 --> 02:31:36.749]  You don't need to be a scientist to figure out who's telling you the truth.
[02:31:37.269 --> 02:31:46.737]  Anybody who's calling for, anyone who has a censorship list, like the disinformation does in censorship lists, these people are on the wrong side of history.
[02:31:47.298 --> 02:31:52.002]  Every single time censorship has been used, people are on the wrong side of history.
[02:31:52.022 --> 02:31:54.204]  Well, Steve, you say they're not raising the exits, but they're...
[02:31:55.144 --> 02:31:57.386]  But that process, I think you said you agree, is starting.
[02:31:57.986 --> 02:31:59.067]  What do you make of Zuckerberg?
[02:31:59.087 --> 02:32:00.228]  I don't want to get into all the technicals.
[02:32:00.248 --> 02:32:01.128]  There's a lot more on that.
[02:32:01.729 --> 02:32:09.974]  And what do you make of them trying to launch all these new emergencies and their emergency authorization for the bird flu shot?
[02:32:10.215 --> 02:32:16.119]  I think it's pretty clear they've got part of Massachusetts locked down right now over mosquito, that they're trying to get the fear going again.
[02:32:18.060 --> 02:32:18.420]  Oh, yeah.
[02:32:18.660 --> 02:32:22.783]  You know, the COVID vaccines were approved under emergency use authorization.
[02:32:22.823 --> 02:32:23.804]  Where's the emergency?
[02:32:24.671 --> 02:32:26.412]  Alex, where's the emergency?
[02:32:27.192 --> 02:32:28.632]  There is no emergency.
[02:32:28.872 --> 02:32:30.413]  Biden ended the emergency.
[02:32:30.853 --> 02:32:35.795]  Why are we still approving drugs under an emergency use authorization?
[02:32:36.355 --> 02:32:37.555]  It's because they can.
[02:32:37.795 --> 02:32:41.296]  The law lets them get away with it even though there's no emergency.
[02:32:41.697 --> 02:32:45.998]  Biden, I don't know when it was, it was many months ago,
[02:32:45.998 --> 02:32:48.639]  Well, maybe it was a year ago that Biden said the emergency is over.
[02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:54.683]  So why is the FDA doing emergency use authorizations for the latest COVID vaccines?
[02:32:55.323 --> 02:33:01.806]  You know, and the other thing that's really troubling to me is that there aren't any success anecdotes.
[02:33:02.287 --> 02:33:11.592]  Like when I ask for people who've been harmed by the vaccine, I get inundated with all sorts of horror stories of the vaccines and people know someone.
[02:33:12.212 --> 02:33:15.574]  And my doctor friend said, you know, everyone in the military knows someone
[02:33:16.498 --> 02:33:19.580]  Everyone in the military knows someone who's been injured by the vaccine.
[02:33:20.220 --> 02:33:23.281]  And so, where are the success stories, Alex?
[02:33:23.621 --> 02:33:26.263]  I have never heard a success story.
[02:33:26.563 --> 02:33:32.886]  I've been looking at CNN, I've been looking at New York Times, Washington Post, you know, there's nothing.
[02:33:32.906 --> 02:33:34.847]  Fauci's had six shots.
[02:33:35.287 --> 02:33:38.048]  Fauci's had six shots and has had COVID, is it three or four times?
[02:33:39.269 --> 02:33:39.489]  Yeah.
[02:33:40.390 --> 02:33:42.032]  Yeah, I mean, it's crazy.
[02:33:42.052 --> 02:33:44.414]  The more shots you get, the more likely you are to get COVID.
[02:33:44.715 --> 02:33:46.156]  They proved that in the military.
[02:33:46.216 --> 02:33:47.758]  I got the stats in the military.
[02:33:48.159 --> 02:33:55.387]  It's like people who are unvaccinated weren't getting COVID anywhere close to the rate that people who are vaccinated are getting COVID.
[02:33:55.667 --> 02:33:57.429]  So the military has this data.
[02:33:57.469 --> 02:33:59.111]  They're simply ignoring it.
[02:33:59.671 --> 02:34:00.892]  And it's so tragic.
[02:34:01.172 --> 02:34:06.395]  And yet, we don't see in the New York Times or CNN, we never see that success story.
[02:34:06.615 --> 02:34:17.761]  We never see a case where that nursing home rolled out the vaccines and the 10 deaths they were getting per month went to zero from COVID after the shots rolled out.
[02:34:18.081 --> 02:34:20.883]  And in fact, the stories that I hear are just the reverse.
[02:34:21.403 --> 02:34:35.050]  The stories that I see, and I can see it in the Medicare data, I know there's this one clinic that I'm aware of, I know when they rolled out the shots because I got a call from someone who knows, who has a relative that works there, and I know when the shots were rolled out.
[02:34:35.290 --> 02:34:41.174]  Before the shots rolled out, they were having one death a week, and very consistently.
[02:34:41.594 --> 02:34:47.417]  After the shots rolled out, they were having eight deaths per week for the next three weeks straight after the shots rolled out.
[02:34:48.186 --> 02:34:49.427]  That's not a coincidence.
[02:34:49.887 --> 02:34:51.088]  These shots are a disaster.
[02:34:51.108 --> 02:34:53.830]  That's why there are no success stories anywhere.
[02:34:54.090 --> 02:34:56.331]  There are no success stories in the nursing homes.
[02:34:56.371 --> 02:34:59.253]  There are no success stories in the geriatric practices.
[02:34:59.533 --> 02:35:01.695]  There are no success stories in the military.
[02:35:01.955 --> 02:35:03.976]  There are no success stories, period.
[02:35:04.337 --> 02:35:10.941]  And in fact, there was even a study that was published in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association.
[02:35:11.321 --> 02:35:12.382]  It was done by
[02:35:14.104 --> 02:35:17.165]  A very famous epidemiologist at the VA.
[02:35:17.685 --> 02:35:36.530]  And what was interesting is that when you look at the data and you reanalyze the data, and I did a paper published in preprints on this, when you look at the data it actually proves that the COVID vaccines and the flu vaccines were completely ineffective in
[02:35:37.871 --> 02:35:39.872]  Reducing the rate of hospitalization.
[02:35:40.293 --> 02:35:44.836]  In other words, the COVID vaccines and the flu vaccines do not work.
[02:35:44.876 --> 02:35:53.321]  They do not prevent hospitalization, which means they have effectively no benefit because they also increase the risk of infection.
[02:35:53.401 --> 02:36:00.306]  Sure, and Steve, I mean, I got you to digress off into that, but you're the real expert on the latest numbers of deaths, the statistics of the 15 minutes we have left.
[02:36:00.326 --> 02:36:06.790]  I'm going to try to, all the data you've got, just give us the latest dump and then what you think we do about stopping them doing this again.
[02:36:09.085 --> 02:36:22.655]  OK, so the numbers you can estimate, the numbers that you get in terms of overall numbers, sort of an average number, is somewhere on the order of two per thousand people who got the vaccine.
[02:36:23.155 --> 02:36:25.477]  Two of them were killed by the vaccine.
[02:36:25.837 --> 02:36:28.239]  And these people, when they die, they die of cardiac arrest.
[02:36:28.359 --> 02:36:29.040]  Thank you.
[02:36:42.492 --> 02:36:44.333]  Put them down as a COVID vaccine death.
[02:36:44.353 --> 02:36:47.754]  They put them down as a cardiac arrest death or what have you.
[02:36:48.295 --> 02:37:02.280]  And so when you look at the numbers and you talk to physicians, and I've talked to many physicians directly, and the average for all age ranges is about two deaths per thousand.
[02:37:02.361 --> 02:37:07.863]  So there have been about 270 million people in America who've gotten the shots.
[02:37:08.343 --> 02:37:17.931]  So we're looking on the order of over half a million deaths that have been caused by these vaccines.
[02:37:17.971 --> 02:37:31.502]  And it might be more than that, it might be a little bit less, but it's on the order of 500, 600,000 Americans that have died from the vaccine.
[02:37:31.542 --> 02:37:33.164]  What about globally?
[02:37:33.184 --> 02:37:33.784]  What about globally?
[02:37:33.804 --> 02:37:35.325]  Your number's 18 million, 25 million, you know.
[02:37:37.068 --> 02:37:46.080]  Yeah, you know, it's somewhere on the order of it's well over 10 million and speaks for probably between 10 and 20 million people have been killed by the vaccine worldwide.
[02:37:46.841 --> 02:37:51.727]  And so, you know, if you just look at the numbers, you know,
[02:37:52.268 --> 02:37:53.189]  Five billion people.
[02:37:53.209 --> 02:37:55.191]  You multiply that by two, that's 10 million.
[02:37:55.672 --> 02:37:58.295]  Other people will estimate a higher number than that.
[02:37:58.335 --> 02:38:00.958]  I think Denny Rancourt estimated 17 million.
[02:38:01.218 --> 02:38:03.020]  But we're all in the same ballpark here.
[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:05.783]  We're all within a factor of two of each other.
[02:38:06.164 --> 02:38:10.709]  So, you know, 17 million people worldwide or even just 10 million people worldwide.
[02:38:10.809 --> 02:38:11.029]  This is
[02:38:11.109 --> 02:38:13.590]  This is a disaster beyond all proportions.
[02:38:13.610 --> 02:38:21.774]  This is like multiple world wars and it's being caused by the governments who basically just don't want to look at their data and don't want to admit it.
[02:38:21.874 --> 02:38:23.255]  They won't expose the data.
[02:38:23.455 --> 02:38:27.037]  Look, if these vaccines are saving lives, then just expose the data.
[02:38:27.077 --> 02:38:29.798]  Expose the record level data just like the Czech Republic did.
[02:38:30.058 --> 02:38:31.399]  There is no harm in doing that.
[02:38:31.519 --> 02:38:32.920]  Everybody will then have the numbers.
[02:38:33.380 --> 02:38:38.502]  People like Tom Jefferson who want to do evidence-based medicine will be able to have the data to do their jobs.
[02:38:38.882 --> 02:38:44.404]  But the governments worldwide keep this data from the people.
[02:38:44.784 --> 02:38:47.084]  And that is very troubling.
[02:38:47.184 --> 02:38:49.165]  It shows that they're hiding something.
[02:38:49.305 --> 02:38:50.506]  Tell us about the check data.
[02:38:50.546 --> 02:38:52.566]  You just mentioned that you wrote an article about it.
[02:38:56.556 --> 02:39:03.202]  Yeah, so the Czech data, somebody issued a Freedom of Information Act request to the Czech government.
[02:39:03.662 --> 02:39:08.226]  Now, the Czech Republic government keeps very detailed stats.
[02:39:08.266 --> 02:39:10.468]  I mean, really impressed with the stats that they keep.
[02:39:10.768 --> 02:39:14.511]  And so they actually were able to respond to a FOIA request.
[02:39:14.912 --> 02:39:20.897]  Normally, these FOIA requests get denied because they put the vaccination data in a different database
[02:39:21.477 --> 02:39:22.718]  Then the death data.
[02:39:22.918 --> 02:39:30.841]  And they say, ah, hey, FOIA request, but we're not required to do a database join so that we can tell you when these people died.
[02:39:31.221 --> 02:39:33.602]  And without the database join, you're stuck.
[02:39:33.642 --> 02:39:34.543]  You can't do anything.
[02:39:34.863 --> 02:39:44.387]  But the Czech Republic responded to the FOIA request and either did the join or they had predone the join, the database join, so they were able to give us the records.
[02:39:45.707 --> 02:39:50.613]  The records then were in plain sight for four months and nobody knew about them.
[02:39:50.954 --> 02:40:01.266]  And I just happened to be talking to a researcher in the Czech Republic and he casually mentions to me that, yeah, we have this insurance data, but we also have the data for the entire country.
[02:40:01.747 --> 02:40:04.049]  And I go ballistic when I hear that.
[02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:05.471]  We're good to go.
[02:40:19.701 --> 02:40:28.223]  I'm doing a brand comparison between brands and I look because the only difference in the Czech Republic between getting a Pfizer shot and Moderna shot is just pure luck.
[02:40:28.663 --> 02:40:30.403]  It was you weren't allowed to choose.
[02:40:30.783 --> 02:40:32.644]  You were just assigned a brand.
[02:40:32.884 --> 02:40:36.624]  And so it's effectively like the large world's largest randomized trial.
[02:40:36.964 --> 02:40:44.666]  And what we found very conclusively is for all age groups 40 and this five year age groups and we can do it single eight year age groups too.
[02:40:45.679 --> 02:40:49.883]  40 years old, up to 95 years old, for like every single age.
[02:40:51.864 --> 02:40:56.488]  The Moderna shots were far, far more deadly than the Pfizer shots.
[02:40:57.089 --> 02:40:59.871]  And this is an all-cause mortality increase.
[02:40:59.971 --> 02:41:02.753]  Vaccines are never supposed to increase your all-cause mortality.
[02:41:02.773 --> 02:41:05.215]  They're always supposed to make you less likely to die.
[02:41:05.235 --> 02:41:06.796]  They're never supposed to make you more likely to die.
[02:41:07.257 --> 02:41:09.078]  And this is unimpeachable data.
[02:41:09.118 --> 02:41:11.440]  It's been reviewed by lots of people.
[02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:12.321]  Smoking gun.
[02:41:12.361 --> 02:41:12.781]  Smoking gun.
[02:41:15.103 --> 02:41:15.663]  Smoking gun!
[02:41:15.683 --> 02:41:16.703]  Smoking gun!
[02:41:16.723 --> 02:41:17.824]  And nobody's talking about it.
[02:41:17.884 --> 02:41:22.745]  And no epidemiologist on the other side is saying, hey, look at this check data.
[02:41:22.785 --> 02:41:24.826]  It's proof that vaccines are safe and effective.
[02:41:25.306 --> 02:41:38.050]  And the fact that this data has never been available before and nobody on the pro-vaccine side is looking at this data means that, yeah, this data is like a touching of the third rail here.
[02:41:38.330 --> 02:41:39.490]  If you touch this, you're dead.
[02:41:39.550 --> 02:41:42.911]  You can't survive as an epidemiologist because you'd have to admit
[02:41:43.695 --> 02:41:44.937]  That the vaccines are not safe.
[02:41:44.957 --> 02:41:45.899]  The vaccines are killing people.
[02:41:45.919 --> 02:41:47.321]  There's no other way to look at this data.
[02:41:47.721 --> 02:41:53.751]  How does it correspond with the other big leak where they had the triple databases together in New Zealand?
[02:41:56.154 --> 02:42:00.237]  So in New Zealand, we had less data than the Czech Republic.
[02:42:00.257 --> 02:42:02.839]  Because the Czech Republic, we've got data for 10 million people.
[02:42:02.879 --> 02:42:07.723]  In New Zealand, we have data on 4 million people, but we only had about a third of the vaccination records.
[02:42:08.104 --> 02:42:09.845]  So we didn't have all the vaccine records.
[02:42:10.225 --> 02:42:13.708]  And we only had one brand of vaccine used in New Zealand.
[02:42:14.168 --> 02:42:18.870]  And so that's problematic because you now have to compare the unvaccinated with the vaccinated.
[02:42:18.910 --> 02:42:25.753]  And this has always been problematic because the vaccinated typically die at half the rate of the vaccinated.
[02:42:25.813 --> 02:42:28.955]  And it has nothing whatsoever to do with the vaccine.
[02:42:29.015 --> 02:42:34.117]  It has to do with the people who opt for vaccines are typically far healthier than people who
[02:42:34.975 --> 02:42:36.436]  Don't take the vaccines.
[02:42:36.456 --> 02:42:47.847]  Now, that has nothing to do with the fact that vaccinated people are healthier, because people who get all the vaccines are far less healthy than equivalent people who get no vaccines.
[02:42:47.967 --> 02:42:51.009]  So, it's not like you should be getting vaccines.
[02:42:51.090 --> 02:42:52.671]  Nobody should be getting any vaccines.
[02:42:52.731 --> 02:42:56.935]  If I had to live my life over, I never would have gotten any shots if I had a choice.
[02:42:57.235 --> 02:42:58.877]  I never would have gotten a single shot.
[02:42:59.465 --> 02:43:04.868]  But you're saying you had better range finding with the Czech Republic because you had two different shots to compare as well.
[02:43:05.569 --> 02:43:06.429]  I had brands.
[02:43:06.509 --> 02:43:10.231]  I had multiple brands because I could look at AstraZeneca.
[02:43:10.372 --> 02:43:11.772]  I could look at Moderna.
[02:43:11.812 --> 02:43:12.913]  I could look at Pfizer.
[02:43:12.933 --> 02:43:14.214]  I could look at Novavax.
[02:43:14.674 --> 02:43:19.678]  And so I could actually do a brand comparison in terms of efficacy and safety.
[02:43:20.119 --> 02:43:25.303]  And what it showed was that there was no efficacy whatsoever in these shots.
[02:43:25.784 --> 02:43:29.847]  And the safety of it was all in safety.
[02:43:30.027 --> 02:43:37.354]  It was all the difference in the different brands has nothing to do with effectiveness against COVID, which was zero.
[02:43:38.740 --> 02:43:40.921]  It's just how effective at making you sick or killing you.
[02:43:41.562 --> 02:43:44.924]  But I remember early on, researchers said Moderna was way worse.
[02:43:45.004 --> 02:43:46.845]  Isn't it the same thing, just three times stronger?
[02:43:46.865 --> 02:43:51.328]  Moderna, yeah, that's right.
[02:43:51.548 --> 02:43:55.091]  So Pfizer is a 30-microgram shot.
[02:43:55.711 --> 02:44:03.816]  And Moderna is about three, over three times more at 100 micrograms.
[02:44:04.196 --> 02:44:06.218]  So Moderna is three times the dose.
[02:44:06.938 --> 02:44:15.020]  And since we know that these vaccines are causing nothing but harm, the more dose you get of the harm, the worse it's going to get.
[02:44:15.300 --> 02:44:34.125]  So why should we be surprised when Moderna, which has anywhere, because some Moderna shots were 50 micrograms, so anywhere from one and a half times the Pfizer dose to three times the Pfizer dose, we shouldn't be surprised at all that Moderna had
[02:44:35.402 --> 02:44:39.346]  A higher mortality rate, all-cause mortality after the shot.
[02:44:39.746 --> 02:44:43.490]  Now, we've seen the exact same signal in other databases.
[02:44:43.530 --> 02:44:47.394]  So, in the VAERS database we saw a 1.3 times increase.
[02:44:47.774 --> 02:44:53.540]  Exactly the same number as in the Czech Republic data.
[02:44:54.060 --> 02:45:21.171]  And so we're seeing confirmation that this checked data matches what's in the VAERS database, it matches what's in the Yellow Card system, it matches with all of these systems, and it even matches the increase found in the randomized trials where the Moderna shots actually had one and a half times the number of side effects of serious adverse events versus the Pfizer shots on a per shot basis.
[02:45:21.331 --> 02:45:22.752]  So this is pretty much open and shut.
[02:45:22.792 --> 02:45:25.194]  We really appreciate you spending the hour with us.
[02:45:25.894 --> 02:45:28.516]  People should follow you on X. They should follow your sub stack.
[02:45:28.556 --> 02:45:33.500]  How do we get you with this open and shut data in front of Congress?
[02:45:33.540 --> 02:45:34.680]  Or what needs to happen now?
[02:45:34.700 --> 02:45:36.542]  Because the same group is going to try it again.
[02:45:37.332 --> 02:45:37.772]  They already are.
[02:45:38.132 --> 02:45:38.453]  Yeah.
[02:45:38.773 --> 02:45:46.598]  You know, I've been trying to reach out to the staff of the people who are speaking out, and they just ignore me.
[02:45:46.898 --> 02:45:48.279]  They say, oh, what district are you in?
[02:45:48.359 --> 02:45:50.060]  And I say, I'm in California.
[02:45:50.180 --> 02:45:52.421]  And it's like, you know, click.
[02:45:52.441 --> 02:45:52.981]  Don't call us.
[02:45:53.021 --> 02:45:53.542]  We'll call you.
[02:45:55.623 --> 02:45:57.725]  The champion, though, of this has been Ron Johnson.
[02:45:58.185 --> 02:46:04.310]  So Johnson always takes my calls and Ron Johnson has just been in the Senate.
[02:46:04.410 --> 02:46:10.735]  He's just been a champion of this and a champion for the vaccine injured and a champion for truth.
[02:46:11.235 --> 02:46:14.838]  And he's gotten lots of flack in the media for doing this.
[02:46:14.878 --> 02:46:16.739]  He's called anti-science and so forth.
[02:46:17.160 --> 02:46:20.422]  But, you know, to his credit, he's not giving up.
[02:46:20.522 --> 02:46:25.106]  He's not taking the easy road and just saying, OK, I'm not going to talk about this.
[02:46:25.606 --> 02:46:29.489]  Ron Johnson is just an amazing human being.
[02:46:29.930 --> 02:46:32.672]  And I really got to give him a lot of credit.
[02:46:33.112 --> 02:46:57.737]  For speaking out and for speaking for the giving the voice for the vaccine injured and there are plenty of these people and also holding these sessions in Washington DC where he invites both sides to the table to have a dialogue and the only people that show up are people on our side and we're showing up with the evidence showing that these vaccines are unsafe
[02:46:58.417 --> 02:47:00.098]  Then nobody should take these vaccines.
[02:47:00.138 --> 02:47:04.161]  They have no benefit whatsoever, and they're nothing but downside.
[02:47:04.702 --> 02:47:07.284]  Steve Kirsch, we're out of time.
[02:47:08.325 --> 02:47:09.325]  Your message is watch out.
[02:47:09.746 --> 02:47:10.847]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:47:10.907 --> 02:47:11.487]  God bless you.
[02:47:11.507 --> 02:47:13.989]  We'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[02:47:14.069 --> 02:47:14.449]  Thank you.
[02:47:16.191 --> 02:47:16.671]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:47:17.371 --> 02:47:18.032]  Very powerful.
[02:47:18.272 --> 02:47:25.638]  We have huge breaking news on the grabbing of the Telegram founder and information with the amazing
[02:47:27.185 --> 02:47:29.726]  Yes, that is coming up, Daniel Estlin.
[02:47:29.766 --> 02:47:32.647]  Please remember, I can't do this without you.
[02:47:32.687 --> 02:47:33.987]  We're saving a lot of lives here.
[02:47:34.007 --> 02:47:34.987]  The Globalists are after us.
[02:47:36.047 --> 02:47:37.568]  They can't operate if we're still on air.
[02:47:37.708 --> 02:47:38.568]  Please support us.

[02:47:51.171 --> 02:47:56.813]  It is the breakdown of high-quality methylfolate that is the breakdown of the cells of folic acid that most people can't fully process.
[02:47:56.853 --> 02:47:58.814]  It gives you incredible energy with no letdown.

[02:48:28.230 --> 02:48:29.951]  If you want to keep us on air, go there now.
[02:48:30.291 --> 02:48:32.493]  I'll introduce our number four with Daniel Estolano.
[02:48:33.033 --> 02:48:40.534]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[02:48:41.174 --> 02:48:43.435]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[02:48:44.055 --> 02:48:50.576]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation.
[02:48:50.596 --> 02:48:54.137]  And that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[02:48:54.617 --> 02:49:00.778]  And I'm asking you now at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison,
[02:49:01.698 --> 02:49:10.362]  To double down and support the broadcast more than ever, to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at infowarestore.com.
[02:49:10.562 --> 02:49:19.666]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[02:49:20.046 --> 02:49:21.287]  These are very, very popular.
[02:49:21.307 --> 02:49:22.287]  And I went looking up online.
[02:49:22.687 --> 02:49:23.608]  It is very, very popular.
[02:49:24.188 --> 02:49:25.948]  It's not an investment, it's a collectible.
[02:49:26.128 --> 02:49:33.050]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:49:33.490 --> 02:49:37.491]  Best group out there, highest ratings, amazing prices, the best.
[02:49:37.751 --> 02:49:41.792]  This is a collectible and a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[02:49:42.332 --> 02:49:50.053]  Then the bankruptcy started and the people that came in from the courts said, we're not going to keep outside people's products in here, in your store.
[02:49:51.174 --> 02:49:51.994]  And they kicked him back.
[02:49:53.132 --> 02:49:56.861]  Uh, to the folks, despite the fact we'd already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[02:49:57.162 --> 02:49:59.047]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company...
[02:49:59.861 --> 02:50:08.327]  And now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[02:50:08.847 --> 02:50:17.253]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[02:50:17.733 --> 02:50:27.940]  Stock up on 24 karat .999 pure gold in the most popular size of one-tenth gram, an affordable sleek card that fits your wallet, drawer, glove compartment, and is easy to travel with.
[02:50:28.340 --> 02:50:29.841]  They're amazing cards.
[02:50:30.201 --> 02:50:32.003]  It's got original art I came up with.
[02:50:32.103 --> 02:50:34.524]  It's got the little bar of gold in there.
[02:50:35.025 --> 02:50:37.666]  And it just lets you know that you supported the InfoWar.
[02:50:37.967 --> 02:50:44.011]  You'll have a historical memento as a keepsake for yourself, your family, for your children, and your grandchildren.
[02:50:44.031 --> 02:50:45.672]  Because this is a historic fight.
[02:50:46.052 --> 02:50:49.895]  And this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[02:50:50.255 --> 02:50:51.556]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[02:50:52.196 --> 02:50:55.098]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[02:50:55.658 --> 02:50:58.660]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[02:50:59.020 --> 02:51:03.883]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[02:51:04.263 --> 02:51:06.344]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[02:51:07.144 --> 02:51:13.128]  We've only got a few thousand of these left, and I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[02:51:13.168 --> 02:51:13.748]  Now, I want to be clear.
[02:51:14.328 --> 02:51:16.510]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[02:51:16.530 --> 02:51:17.250]  That's not what this is.
[02:51:17.270 --> 02:51:18.371]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[02:51:18.971 --> 02:51:32.062]  This is like, on NPR, that still gives taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug to cost them $5, or a baseball cap to cost them $10, and you make a $100 donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the New World Order.
[02:51:32.343 --> 02:51:33.263]  I know you don't want to do that.
[02:51:34.004 --> 02:51:38.808]  This costs, I think they told me, more than $10 per card, something like that, $10 or $11, and so the other
[02:51:41.505 --> 02:51:44.348]  80-something dollars will go to fund the operation.
[02:51:44.408 --> 02:51:47.532]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[02:51:48.073 --> 02:51:55.761]  So, get your collectible card, your piece of art, with the little piece of gold in it, today, and you will help keep us on air.
[02:51:56.122 --> 02:51:57.223]  The decision is yours.
[02:51:57.243 --> 02:51:58.645]  This is a limited edition.
[02:51:59.285 --> 02:52:03.667]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[02:52:04.308 --> 02:52:14.593]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time, and myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.
[02:52:14.973 --> 02:52:23.858]  So please take action now at InfoWarsTore.com and get the exclusive InfoWars limited edition proprietary 24 karat 999 pure gold collectible.
[02:52:24.258 --> 02:52:25.119]  Thank you for your support.
[02:52:25.479 --> 02:52:27.120]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[02:52:33.041 --> 02:52:38.783]  Well, this happens when you do four hours a day live and you've got three shows you do that are every day and special reports.
[02:52:38.803 --> 02:52:40.884]  We have a lot of great guests, great producers and book people.
[02:52:40.904 --> 02:52:42.024]  Daniel Esselstyn is amazing.
[02:52:42.865 --> 02:52:46.386]  We've got time zones or something crossed with him, so he's not going to be hosting this hour.
[02:52:46.726 --> 02:52:47.727]  You're stuck with me!
[02:52:49.087 --> 02:52:50.368]  I'm not locked in here with you.
[02:52:50.388 --> 02:52:53.449]  You're locked in here with me, which is great because I want to take your phone calls.
[02:52:54.889 --> 02:53:02.012]  Since we just did an hour on the poison shots and the real numbers are over 30 million dead now, they just curse me very conservative.
[02:53:03.939 --> 02:53:05.380]  You can count the turbo cancers and all that.
[02:53:05.400 --> 02:53:06.521]  They're just stuff that's totally clear.
[02:53:06.541 --> 02:53:07.222]  It's like 20 million.
[02:53:08.904 --> 02:53:12.227]  Let's open the phones up on one big subject coming up the next segment.
[02:53:12.307 --> 02:53:13.488]  I'll open the phones up, get the number up.
[02:53:14.609 --> 02:53:22.516]  What has your experience been as a nurse or a doctor or a military person or just a mother or father, grandma, grandpa, brother or sister, a son or daughter?
[02:53:23.017 --> 02:53:28.141]  What have your experiences been with the Moderna, with the Pfizer, with the J&J, with the AstraZeneca?
[02:53:28.582 --> 02:53:29.342]  Because they want us
[02:53:30.322 --> 02:53:38.866]  To forget about this, and they stopped part of their hysteria for a year, and now they're right back with lockdowns and controls and stay in your houses and all the rest of it.
[02:53:40.127 --> 02:53:41.327]  All over the country in blue cities.
[02:53:41.707 --> 02:53:43.368]  Oh, Zika.
[02:53:43.388 --> 02:53:44.029]  Oh, this thing.
[02:53:44.329 --> 02:53:45.109]  Oh, that thing.
[02:53:45.669 --> 02:53:46.890]  Oh, monkeypox.
[02:53:47.070 --> 02:53:47.830]  Oh, mpox.
[02:53:47.930 --> 02:53:48.751]  Same thing, different name.
[02:53:49.591 --> 02:53:50.632]  Thinking that'll scare you.
[02:53:50.732 --> 02:53:53.673]  Oh, the triple E. Oh, the bird flu.
[02:53:55.534 --> 02:53:56.214]  It's happening.
[02:53:56.234 --> 02:53:57.395]  They're trying to ram through a U.N.
[02:53:57.435 --> 02:53:57.715]  treaty.
[02:53:57.735 --> 02:53:57.935]  The U.N.
[02:53:57.955 --> 02:53:59.216]  has declared another emergency.
[02:54:00.670 --> 02:54:01.891]  68 days out from the election.
[02:54:02.632 --> 02:54:06.416]  You can talk about your experiences on the shot or just your take on them trying to bring it all back.
[02:54:07.317 --> 02:54:11.300]  We are going to open the phones up when I come back, when some stations join us.
[02:54:11.320 --> 02:54:18.487]  I want to give the number out to not just people on the internet, which are great, but everybody on the 300 plus radio stations that we're on.
[02:54:19.468 --> 02:54:20.829]  So we haven't turned the phone system on yet.
[02:54:20.869 --> 02:54:21.610]  It's a digital system.
[02:54:21.650 --> 02:54:23.492]  I'm going to flip it on when I come back at six after.
[02:54:24.599 --> 02:54:31.203]  We're going to take your calls for this hour, and then the War Room with the great Owen Schreyer is coming up 3 p.m.
[02:54:31.223 --> 02:54:37.207]  By the way, Owen's been here eight years, and he does, over eight years, a fabulous job, but he just gets better and better.
[02:54:37.808 --> 02:54:38.708]  So does Harrison Smith.
[02:54:38.748 --> 02:54:42.431]  Harrison Smith was really good years ago, now he's excellent.
[02:54:43.111 --> 02:54:44.152]  And so is Owen.
[02:54:44.172 --> 02:54:49.836]  A lot of times I'll stop and watch the show, and I'm like, I've got work to do, I can't watch or listen, and they're just knocking it out of the park.
[02:54:50.436 --> 02:54:52.538]  So we're doing 10 hours of live transmission today.
[02:54:52.878 --> 02:54:53.919]  If InfoWars survives,
[02:54:54.793 --> 02:55:09.390]  Which, there's a lot of strategic reasons I don't want to get into inside baseball, but we will know by late November whether InfoWars is going to continue on.
[02:55:11.152 --> 02:55:12.354]  There's a very good chance it is.
[02:55:13.447 --> 02:55:17.110]  And that's why they panicked and tried to shut us down without a court order eight weeks ago.
[02:55:17.671 --> 02:55:19.672]  And people thought I was joking and it was in the news.
[02:55:19.732 --> 02:55:20.753]  No, they came to shut it down.
[02:55:21.294 --> 02:55:26.979]  Federal agents that the court had appointed, but without the court's order, he fired them when there was a hearing two weeks later.
[02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:29.281]  And then they were like, we'll still get you.
[02:55:29.301 --> 02:55:30.001]  The judge said no.
[02:55:31.343 --> 02:55:37.128]  But then there's a process where, because I'm in personal bankruptcy, I've already declared seven, I'm out of it, basically.
[02:55:38.018 --> 02:55:39.099]  Then I own this company.
[02:55:39.119 --> 02:55:39.879]  It's an LLC.
[02:55:39.979 --> 02:55:40.920]  The assets will be sold.
[02:55:41.080 --> 02:55:43.962]  The assets went on sale last week.
[02:55:44.563 --> 02:55:46.264]  We're going to have auctions coming up in the next few months.
[02:55:47.024 --> 02:55:48.185]  And there's a lot going into that.
[02:55:48.265 --> 02:55:51.908]  And there's obviously Patriots that want to buy the system.
[02:55:52.948 --> 02:55:53.749]  And then we continue on.
[02:55:53.769 --> 02:55:55.310]  And I work for those folks, if I choose to.
[02:55:55.350 --> 02:55:56.471]  Which, if they're good people, I will.
[02:55:56.891 --> 02:55:59.373]  If not, they say they've got Soros-type people.
[02:55:59.393 --> 02:56:00.834]  They say big guys, Democrats.
[02:56:02.011 --> 02:56:03.832]  I believe they're gonna come in here just to shut it down.
[02:56:03.932 --> 02:56:08.134]  And then if that's the case, and they outbid the people, then you see it in front of the world what it is, what they said they wanted.
[02:56:08.234 --> 02:56:09.235]  And I've not given up.
[02:56:09.275 --> 02:56:10.015]  I've not backed down.
[02:56:10.055 --> 02:56:10.776]  I've gone 110%.
[02:56:13.077 --> 02:56:14.038]  And we are continuing on.
[02:56:14.738 --> 02:56:17.900]  There's a lot of other inside baseball to that, but I tell you, the big variable, that's you.
[02:56:19.060 --> 02:56:21.542]  We need this place to be in the black.
[02:56:22.594 --> 02:56:35.690]  To be able to have the buyers and again go forward and because of supply chain problems and the CRO trying to sabotage us and that was court appointed but wasn't obviously an operative and working with the US trustees admittedly to shut us down illegally.
[02:56:36.744 --> 02:56:38.005]  We're good to go.
[02:56:58.255 --> 02:56:59.136]  I've only got you now.
[02:56:59.576 --> 02:57:02.739]  And it was you that helped me before, and I had some capital backed up as emergency backup.
[02:57:02.999 --> 02:57:03.660]  And it was always there.
[02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:06.782]  My family was like, aren't you sad you're selling your house and doing this and that?
[02:57:06.802 --> 02:57:07.703]  I said, it was always there.
[02:57:07.743 --> 02:57:09.424]  I didn't have a big house because I wanted a big house.
[02:57:09.825 --> 02:57:11.866]  I'm actually happier, you know, living in a smaller home.
[02:57:13.388 --> 02:57:14.388]  But I just want to stay in the fight.
[02:57:14.649 --> 02:57:16.610]  And it's you that keeps the fight at InfoWarsTory.com.
[02:57:17.191 --> 02:57:19.513]  All right, we're opening up the phones.
[02:57:21.494 --> 02:57:25.477]  For your personal experience or family's experience or your eyewitness accounts,
[02:57:26.394 --> 02:57:31.476]  Of the Franken shots, and I've done this probably the last four years or three and a half.
[02:57:31.516 --> 02:57:32.497]  They turn the poison shots.
[02:57:33.157 --> 02:57:34.197]  I've done this about.
[02:57:36.218 --> 02:57:37.879]  Probably 40 50 times we've done this.
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:40.360]  I know I've done it at least.
[02:57:41.460 --> 02:57:47.123]  Probably 10 times so far this year is probably more than 50 times, and we've never had one person calling that like the shot that it helped him.
[02:57:48.749 --> 02:57:52.030]  And they admit, in the mainline studies, it doesn't protect you, it lowers your immunity.
[02:57:52.390 --> 02:57:55.131]  And I have the Pfizer scientists going, this is going to be great for business.
[02:57:55.431 --> 02:57:57.552]  After three shots, your immune system is almost totally gone.
[02:57:57.592 --> 02:57:59.133]  It just turns your white blood cells off.
[02:57:59.293 --> 02:58:00.173]  It's kind of like AIDS.
[02:58:02.934 --> 02:58:07.836]  I mean, this is mad scientists, and they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:58:08.996 --> 02:58:12.317]  So all that incredible info we just covered in the last hour with Steve Kirsch, that guy is a hero.
[02:58:12.337 --> 02:58:14.898]  I mean, he goes out and ferrets out the documents.
[02:58:16.079 --> 02:58:16.879]  And all over the world,
[02:58:18.134 --> 02:58:22.855]  From the Czech Republic, to Germany, to the UK, to the US, to Canada, to Australia, to New Zealand, same numbers.
[02:58:24.135 --> 02:58:28.876]  Right up front, kills two out of a thousand, and then you start increasing your death rate from cancers and other things.
[02:58:29.396 --> 02:58:31.857]  But what it really does is attacks the testicles and ovaries.
[02:58:32.457 --> 02:58:33.437]  It's really a steroid.
[02:58:34.377 --> 02:58:36.378]  But it's so powerful, it tends to kill a lot of people.
[02:58:36.678 --> 02:58:38.898]  But they're willing to do that to depopulate.
[02:58:39.198 --> 02:58:46.560]  And now for the first time since the Black Plague, 500 and something years ago, life expectancy's going down, world population's peaked, and it's going down.
[02:58:47.788 --> 02:58:49.069]  So you have to face what it is.
[02:58:49.410 --> 02:58:52.713]  They don't put rat and bug poison fluoride in the water because they like it.
[02:58:53.453 --> 02:58:56.516]  And now the federal government admits it's all true about fluoride.
[02:58:56.937 --> 02:59:00.360]  So vindication, vindication, vindication, vindication, vindication.
[02:59:01.095 --> 02:59:02.635]  You know, I didn't put this clip out, but others did.
[02:59:02.675 --> 02:59:08.057]  I put out the other clips from Tucker yesterday when he was live with us on Real Alex Jones, but he was making a point about the gay frogs.
[02:59:08.717 --> 02:59:12.678]  And that's just something else on the endocrine disruptors that we've been fully vindicated on, but I was vindicated then.
[02:59:13.199 --> 02:59:17.740]  South African studies, Chinese studies, European studies, U.S.
[02:59:17.760 --> 02:59:19.840]  studies, Mexico studies, Brazilian studies.
[02:59:20.501 --> 02:59:22.801]  I mean, so many studies on frog populations.
[02:59:23.381 --> 02:59:28.443]  Some of these frogs have almost gone extinct because the chemical runoff of atrazine pesticide.
[02:59:29.798 --> 02:59:32.159]  And the other chemicals, I mean, and again, they choose these.
[02:59:32.199 --> 02:59:37.701]  These are tiny amounts of this in the water, bends the gender, gives you cancer, reduces fertility.
[02:59:38.101 --> 02:59:39.441]  Here's Tucker on the gay frogs.
[02:59:48.810 --> 02:59:50.331]  Really an amazing interview.
[02:59:50.851 --> 02:59:56.152]  And right in the middle of it, he's like, you know, atrazine, you know, it can, it can change the sex of frogs.
[02:59:56.912 --> 02:59:58.853]  And I, he was on a roll, so I didn't want to interrupt him.
[02:59:58.873 --> 03:00:03.234]  I was like, I think Alex Jones made that point like 15 years ago and was mocked.
[03:00:03.714 --> 03:00:05.195]  And now it's just the science.
[03:00:05.915 --> 03:00:15.538]  You were described as a lunatic, like a mental patient needing like full-time care because you were such a danger to yourself and society when you said that, showing the frogs gay.
[03:00:16.707 --> 03:00:18.589]  And now it's just like, well, that's just the science.
[03:00:18.689 --> 03:00:19.330]  That's the science.
[03:00:19.410 --> 03:00:20.651]  It's the science, you know?
[03:00:20.971 --> 03:00:24.975]  And when is someone going to call Alex Jones and be like, hey, Alex Jones, you were right about the frogs.
[03:00:25.255 --> 03:00:25.536]  Sorry.
[03:00:27.626 --> 03:00:32.347]  Now the committee has decided to shut down one of the most popular journalists on the right, Alex Jones.
[03:00:32.847 --> 03:00:33.547]  Yes, journalist.
[03:00:34.208 --> 03:00:40.469]  Jones is often mocked for his flamboyance, but the truth is he has been a far better guide to reality in recent years.
[03:00:40.489 --> 03:00:48.531]  In other words, a far better journalist than, say, NBC News national security correspondent Ken Delanian or Margaret Brennan of CBS.
[03:00:49.371 --> 03:00:52.352]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[03:00:53.152 --> 03:00:58.095]  And if Jones sat down with Tony Fauci, he would ask him real questions, just as journalists are supposed to do.
[03:00:58.175 --> 03:00:59.756]  He wouldn't just slobber all over him.
[03:01:00.716 --> 03:01:05.379]  But Alex Jones makes fun of Joe Biden, so the January 6th committee is threatening him with prison.
[03:01:06.239 --> 03:01:14.924]  Now the irony here, and there are many layers of irony here, but the main one is that Alex Jones isn't simply innocent of inciting crime on January 6th.
[03:01:15.324 --> 03:01:20.227]  Alex Jones actively worked to prevent crimes from taking place on January 6th.
[03:01:22.683 --> 03:01:24.244]  Alright, nice words from Tucker.
[03:01:24.324 --> 03:01:25.805]  Let me give out the toll-free number.
[03:01:25.825 --> 03:01:25.865]  877-789-2539.
[03:01:25.885 --> 03:01:27.765]  Right there on screen for TV viewers.
[03:01:27.785 --> 03:01:29.046]  877-789-2539.
[03:01:29.066 --> 03:01:31.207]  And again, we're taking calls on four and a half years into the COVID tyranny.
[03:01:40.643 --> 03:01:49.168]  Three and a half years into the poison COVID shots, mass death, tens of millions dead, and the same criminals are trying to bring it all back again.
[03:01:49.428 --> 03:01:56.511]  But Zuckerberg's headed for the tall grass.
[03:01:56.531 --> 03:01:58.833]  877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX.
[03:02:01.054 --> 03:02:06.517]  While we're lining those calls up, the great Chase Geysers put together a little time capsule video
[03:02:08.314 --> 03:02:12.838]  From one of our shows in the past to see what came true, here it is.
[03:02:13.418 --> 03:02:15.180]  Why is it the same program all over the world?
[03:02:15.380 --> 03:02:17.422]  Run by fascists, run by communists, run by corporatists?
[03:02:17.742 --> 03:02:19.564]  Because it's a plan to end us!
[03:02:20.564 --> 03:02:23.747]  To turn us into animals like factory-farmed chickens or pigs!
[03:02:23.847 --> 03:02:24.167]  This is 2016.
[03:02:24.227 --> 03:02:25.809]  And if we act like it, we deserve it.
[03:02:26.269 --> 03:02:31.213]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[03:02:31.233 --> 03:02:31.874]  Now they're coming out.
[03:02:31.934 --> 03:02:33.055]  Visit InfoWars.com.
[03:02:33.075 --> 03:02:34.676]  With cows that don't fart.
[03:02:35.077 --> 03:02:36.318]  Gently engineered, Bill Gates.
[03:02:37.372 --> 03:02:44.681]  More often than not, the number one theme is global censorship of news and information.
[03:02:44.921 --> 03:02:47.905]  But we have parallel media that is exposing it in real time.
[03:02:49.431 --> 03:02:54.354]  The next logical move for them to engage in is the takeover and the shutdown of that media.
[03:02:54.734 --> 03:02:55.794]  Soros document.
[03:02:56.195 --> 03:02:59.256]  Regulate internet to favor open society supporters.
[03:02:59.596 --> 03:03:01.137]  He calls for this in the emails.
[03:03:01.317 --> 03:03:02.878]  This is already going on.
[03:03:03.218 --> 03:03:04.459]  We have the emails, after all.
[03:03:04.519 --> 03:03:05.440]  Soros document.
[03:03:05.500 --> 03:03:07.901]  Regulate internet to favor open society supporters.
[03:03:07.941 --> 03:03:13.104]  When they say open society, they mean global government overrunning your national sovereignty, installing tyranny.
[03:03:14.198 --> 03:03:15.819]  Just look at that demon in that photo.
[03:03:16.079 --> 03:03:16.679]  You're a TV viewer.
[03:03:17.059 --> 03:03:24.141]  And meanwhile, AP reports Pope Francis chits chats in person with Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook.
[03:03:26.482 --> 03:03:28.883]  That's right, they're organizing everything together.
[03:03:29.203 --> 03:03:35.345]  He's calling for censorship, the Pope is, saying Europe being Christian is abhorrent, disgusting.
[03:03:35.365 --> 03:03:36.405]  These are quotes.
[03:03:36.826 --> 03:03:40.827]  Why is it the same program all over the world, run by fascists, run by communists, run by corporatists?
[03:03:41.147 --> 03:03:42.928]  Because it's a plan to end us!
[03:03:43.968 --> 03:03:47.149]  To turn us into animals like factory-farmed chickens or pigs!
[03:03:47.730 --> 03:03:49.210]  And if we act like it, we deserve it.
[03:03:49.530 --> 03:03:50.551]  This is a program.
[03:03:50.611 --> 03:03:51.311]  It's not my opinion.
[03:03:51.371 --> 03:03:52.412]  I'll use the allegory again.
[03:03:52.672 --> 03:03:56.854]  It's like cops busting in to the serial killer's house because they found a dead body in their car.
[03:03:57.094 --> 03:04:06.118]  And they go down and there's videotapes, VHS tapes, of them torturing 20, 30, 40 different women and chopping them up and burying them under the floorboards.
[03:04:06.678 --> 03:04:09.919]  And then a journal, how he did it, when he did it, when he picked them up.
[03:04:10.199 --> 03:04:11.120]  It's open and shut.
[03:04:12.140 --> 03:04:17.362]  I have to sit here metaphorically every day digging up more of the bodies.
[03:04:17.562 --> 03:04:18.362]  They don't even hide them.
[03:04:18.762 --> 03:04:20.943]  And then I get to tell the public what's going on.
[03:04:21.103 --> 03:04:22.203]  People go, oh, that's your opinion.
[03:04:22.484 --> 03:04:24.044]  No, this is not my opinion.
[03:04:24.384 --> 03:04:26.665]  But see, now your children are totally raised by the state.
[03:04:27.465 --> 03:04:29.386]  And now the final phase is coming in.
[03:04:30.905 --> 03:04:41.614]  And they have George Soros funding black groups that are actually asking for a return to slavery where there weren't even men in the household, and the women were brought into the house, and the men were kept out in the barn.
[03:04:42.514 --> 03:04:47.318]  Now the men are kept in the prison, or in the state system, and the women come and get jobs with the state.
[03:04:47.618 --> 03:04:54.504]  But see, the general public doesn't know all this, so you're looking at actual slavery being brought in as a right.
[03:04:55.144 --> 03:04:57.847]  And then they're saying, we are dedicated, we are committed.
[03:04:59.007 --> 03:04:59.508]  That's the quote.
[03:04:59.548 --> 03:05:12.475]  We are committed to disrupting the Western prescribed nuclear family structure required by supporting each other as extended families and villages that collectively care for one another and especially our children to the degree that mothers, parents and children are comfortable.
[03:05:12.715 --> 03:05:15.116]  And they will define what you're comfortable with in a collective.
[03:05:15.556 --> 03:05:20.319]  And guess what the UN says they're going to censor everybody as Facebook and others are already doing in Europe.
[03:05:21.019 --> 03:05:26.843]  In fact, Facebook is being recruited to run the program intergovernmentally as an NGO.
[03:05:27.703 --> 03:05:38.110]  Oh, and then the next article, that's Wall Street Journal, Daily Caller, just as of today, Soros document, undisputed.
[03:05:39.665 --> 03:05:46.354]  Regulate internet to favor open society supporters, and then they start shutting you off economically where you can't operate.
[03:05:46.874 --> 03:05:49.618]  Oh, they won't let Christians or conservative groups have 501c3s.
[03:05:49.798 --> 03:05:51.881]  They won't let veterans groups have 501c3s.
[03:05:52.081 --> 03:05:54.023]  They won't let libertarian groups have 501c3s.
[03:05:54.043 --> 03:05:55.105]  They won't let have...
[03:05:55.345 --> 03:05:59.106]  Law enforcement fraternal organizations that are patriotic have 501c3s.
[03:05:59.526 --> 03:06:02.427]  First, they won't let you have access to the tax exemption.
[03:06:02.607 --> 03:06:03.768]  Then they start auditing you.
[03:06:03.788 --> 03:06:04.908]  They start persecuting you.
[03:06:05.108 --> 03:06:06.228]  This isn't even about Trump.
[03:06:06.348 --> 03:06:11.130]  It's the unified control of the dinosaur media and everyone in lockstep.
[03:06:11.410 --> 03:06:12.470]  This is shameful!
[03:06:14.011 --> 03:06:15.611]  They're getting ready for new banker bailouts.
[03:06:15.651 --> 03:06:16.331]  It's being announced.
[03:06:16.512 --> 03:06:17.692]  New looting of the taxpayers.
[03:06:19.462 --> 03:06:20.442]  They'll all go along with it.
[03:06:21.003 --> 03:06:43.591]  They'll go along with any new wars the establishment starts, and they'll go along with intensified persecution of anyone that's pro-America, anyone that isn't a traitor, anyone that doesn't want race war, anyone that doesn't want to shoot cops in the back of the head when they're changing tires or pumping gas, anyone who isn't a mindless scumbag servant of George Soros.
[03:06:44.844 --> 03:06:54.428]  We are in such incredible peril right now, and the stacks go on and on and on with the censorship now happening.
[03:06:56.369 --> 03:06:58.090]  My life is like a James Bond movie.
[03:06:58.170 --> 03:07:05.533]  The New World Order is here to kill you and your family, but first dumb you down, make you sick, and suck everything out of you.
[03:07:05.634 --> 03:07:10.296]  When you finally get it is the minute we start turning the tide against these people.
[03:07:10.676 --> 03:07:11.536]  I got the blueprints.
[03:07:11.896 --> 03:07:12.877]  You can have the blueprints.
[03:07:15.117 --> 03:07:17.058]  Yep, that's vintage Alex Jones.
[03:07:17.138 --> 03:07:18.099]  I was hitting an all-cylinder.
[03:07:18.119 --> 03:07:20.301]  Still am, but in different ways.
[03:07:20.321 --> 03:07:21.442]  2016, eight years ago.
[03:07:22.422 --> 03:07:25.204]  Giving you tomorrow's news today.
[03:07:26.245 --> 03:07:32.590]  Alright, Phoenix, Todd, Brandon, Christian, Joe, Jay, Austin, Will, Mr. Bones, Shannon.
[03:07:32.610 --> 03:07:36.092]  We're taking all your calls in the 44 minutes left today.
[03:07:36.132 --> 03:07:38.654]  Ahead of Owen Schroer.
[03:07:39.254 --> 03:07:42.396]  Phoenix in New York on the COVID cancer shots.
[03:07:42.417 --> 03:07:42.797]  Go ahead.
[03:07:44.352 --> 03:07:45.173]  Yeah, how you doing, sir?
[03:07:45.193 --> 03:07:49.898]  I was just wondering if you could pull up real quick the definition of cancer and the definition of mRNA.
[03:07:49.938 --> 03:07:51.019]  It's the same exact thing.
[03:07:51.039 --> 03:07:51.800]  You show everybody.
[03:07:51.820 --> 03:07:54.563]  It makes your cells express proteins.
[03:07:54.884 --> 03:07:58.948]  The only difference is in the mRNA, they say specific proteins.
[03:08:00.791 --> 03:08:01.471]  We're good.
[03:08:16.619 --> 03:08:20.781]  Ask not what a tyrant can do for you, but ask what we can do for a tyrant.
[03:08:21.061 --> 03:08:35.168]  If we do not form an anti-tyranny task force and rectify this situation, everyone in Congress, Republican and Democrat, went along with a fake virus under false pretense to roll out an Emergency Use Authorization Act so they can push deadly drugs.
[03:08:35.368 --> 03:08:43.492]  And I'm seeing carnage, I'm seeing people get cancer, I'm seeing young, healthy, strong, fight-nave men, their wife finding them dead on the couch, alright?
[03:08:44.676 --> 03:08:46.797]  Fighting for other tyrants is not gonna fix it.
[03:08:47.198 --> 03:08:48.078]  Alright, America?
[03:08:48.439 --> 03:08:48.799]  Okay?
[03:08:49.139 --> 03:08:57.525]  You gotta get skin in the game, and we gotta form an anti-tyranny task force underneath our- It's legal, it's lawful for us to protect ourselves.
[03:08:57.845 --> 03:08:59.426]  Tyrants are not gonna protect us.
[03:08:59.746 --> 03:09:02.448]  Begging for another election is not gonna stop this.
[03:09:02.728 --> 03:09:03.068]  Alright?
[03:09:03.369 --> 03:09:04.789]  So everyone's gotta get serious.
[03:09:04.990 --> 03:09:14.496]  This is crunch time, because if you thought last time was bad when Trump got in, now they got millions of military-aged men that'll be getting trained in their countries to kill us.
[03:09:14.876 --> 03:09:15.236]  Alright?
[03:09:15.497 --> 03:09:16.737]  That's what's going down.
[03:09:16.957 --> 03:09:23.442]  And that Chinese weather balloon was falling in correlation with the biometric tracking shot!
[03:09:23.742 --> 03:09:25.383]  You know, are you aware of that, Mr. Jones?
[03:09:26.872 --> 03:09:28.313]  Well, I like the urgency in your voice.
[03:09:28.413 --> 03:09:30.413]  I agree with everything except saying the tracking balloon.
[03:09:30.433 --> 03:09:31.854]  They've got satellites balloons.
[03:09:32.294 --> 03:09:34.435]  They've got ground Huawei every time with the Chinese.
[03:09:34.495 --> 03:09:38.976]  I mean, they've got... I mean, Huawei is running some of the big voting machine companies.
[03:09:39.036 --> 03:09:44.959]  I mean, we've got Chicom Surveillance and Globalist Surveillance and Israeli Surveillance and... They're all working together, brother.
[03:09:45.179 --> 03:09:46.099]  They're all working together.
[03:09:46.259 --> 03:09:46.699]  Stop it.
[03:09:47.380 --> 03:09:47.700]  Alright?
[03:09:48.040 --> 03:09:49.220]  Everyone's working together.
[03:09:49.320 --> 03:09:50.721]  It's the people versus them.
[03:09:50.921 --> 03:09:53.082]  Are you on our side or are you on their side?
[03:09:53.422 --> 03:09:54.422]  You know what I mean?
[03:09:54.442 --> 03:09:56.703]  Benjamin Netanyahu's pulling the strings for all these buckets.
[03:09:57.190 --> 03:09:57.510]  Enough!
[03:09:57.971 --> 03:09:58.271]  Enough!
[03:09:58.491 --> 03:10:01.795]  Put up the definition of cancer and the definition of mRNA.
[03:10:02.115 --> 03:10:02.916]  Show everybody.
[03:10:03.176 --> 03:10:04.017]  It's real simple.
[03:10:04.237 --> 03:10:07.340]  They hit everybody with a cancer-file metric tracking shot.
[03:10:07.620 --> 03:10:07.941]  Alright?
[03:10:08.181 --> 03:10:10.543]  Let's stop playing freaking games over here, man.
[03:10:10.583 --> 03:10:12.365]  Well, I don't think I'm playing any games.
[03:10:12.405 --> 03:10:15.048]  We just spent an hour exposing what shots cause cancer.
[03:10:15.088 --> 03:10:16.930]  And it definitely is mucinogenic.
[03:10:17.170 --> 03:10:18.111]  Put it up on the screen.
[03:10:18.151 --> 03:10:18.311]  Hold on.
[03:10:18.331 --> 03:10:18.651]  Hold on.
[03:10:18.671 --> 03:10:19.632]  Let me talk a little bit now.
[03:10:20.407 --> 03:10:22.309]  Well, I mean, I guess they can.
[03:10:22.349 --> 03:10:27.453]  Anybody out there who wants to type in mRNA's definition versus cancer, they're obviously similar.
[03:10:27.493 --> 03:10:33.077]  We've talked about this probably 5,000 times since they released COVID, probably a couple thousand times before they did.
[03:10:33.097 --> 03:10:38.181]  I predicted it all, laid out their documents, and it's definitely true this is going on.
[03:10:38.201 --> 03:10:41.944]  And Netanyahu did say he's going to use all the Israeli population to quote test drugs on.
[03:10:42.905 --> 03:10:52.995]  And that's definitely, you know, what's happened with these criminal governments, and they are definitely working together, and people have to face the full horror of that, and that's what we're doing.
[03:10:53.055 --> 03:10:56.598]  I thought you were mad at the New World Order, and I agree with your urgency.
[03:10:56.618 --> 03:10:59.481]  It sounds like you're kind of mad at me, Phoenix.
[03:10:59.681 --> 03:11:01.023]  Tell me what I can do better, and I'll try.
[03:11:01.889 --> 03:11:04.230]  Well, first of all, it's not the New World Order, okay?
[03:11:04.250 --> 03:11:06.191]  The New World Order is the people that are getting killed.
[03:11:06.211 --> 03:11:06.711]  That's us.
[03:11:06.891 --> 03:11:09.532]  It's the Old World Order, and it's not globalist.
[03:11:09.692 --> 03:11:10.972]  It's Zionist, okay?
[03:11:11.512 --> 03:11:13.853]  So let's brand this correctly, okay?
[03:11:14.073 --> 03:11:16.514]  It's the Zionist Old World Order.
[03:11:16.794 --> 03:11:17.995]  It's the moneylenders.
[03:11:18.355 --> 03:11:20.976]  It's been going on for freaking however long.
[03:11:21.256 --> 03:11:23.657]  It's the dawn of time, you scumbags, alright?
[03:11:23.957 --> 03:11:27.498]  We have a golden opportunity to take a tragedy.
[03:11:27.758 --> 03:11:29.239]  They laid out all the evidence.
[03:11:29.979 --> 03:11:32.261]  Okay, so let me respond to some of this.
[03:11:32.621 --> 03:11:36.884]  I mean, I go on X and I get constantly criticized for working with a Zionist.
[03:11:37.324 --> 03:11:37.724]  I don't.
[03:11:38.204 --> 03:11:39.005]  Never been to Israel.
[03:11:39.025 --> 03:11:40.666]  I don't just hate Israel because it's Israel.
[03:11:41.206 --> 03:11:44.588]  And I expose all the corrupt things that any of these governments do.
[03:11:44.608 --> 03:11:48.771]  And I do think that there is a, you know, globalist Zionist mafia that's heavily involved.
[03:11:49.171 --> 03:11:49.552]  We're good to go.
[03:12:11.814 --> 03:12:16.135]  All of it, and so I was trying to get people to be aware of what's going on.
[03:12:16.495 --> 03:12:32.739]  Are you saying that if Jews didn't exist on earth, or Zionists as you call them, like I said, Jews that support the current political state of Israel and all of that, are you saying the world would be free and open like it would be the return of Christ?
[03:12:32.979 --> 03:12:34.139]  Like evil would be out of the earth?
[03:12:34.179 --> 03:12:36.720]  I mean, are you saying there aren't evil people of every group?
[03:12:38.032 --> 03:12:39.233]  Well, I did not say that at all.
[03:12:39.293 --> 03:12:40.494]  I said Zionist, right?
[03:12:40.574 --> 03:12:41.214]  Is that correct?
[03:12:41.274 --> 03:12:44.096]  I don't want you to misrepresent what I just said.
[03:12:44.256 --> 03:12:46.177]  I answered my question.
[03:12:46.577 --> 03:12:48.419]  I'll put him on hold.
[03:12:48.499 --> 03:12:51.701]  He's not... I said you said Zionist.
[03:12:51.721 --> 03:12:53.062]  I'm not going to have a fake argument with you.
[03:12:53.082 --> 03:12:54.342]  I'm going to ask you a question.
[03:12:55.383 --> 03:13:03.789]  If the Jews were all teleported to another dimension, a happy little planet for them, what would happen to the Earth right now?
[03:13:03.809 --> 03:13:05.129]  Wrong!
[03:13:06.430 --> 03:13:07.271]  I didn't say that!
[03:13:08.873 --> 03:13:09.873]  I can't talk to you anymore, man.
[03:13:10.134 --> 03:13:14.557]  See, you're not having a discussion with me.
[03:13:14.597 --> 03:13:20.721]  I gave you way more time, like six, seven minutes than other callers get, so you didn't get cut off.
[03:13:20.762 --> 03:13:22.763]  I would have had a long discussion with you, but I just can't.
[03:13:22.983 --> 03:13:23.664]  I can't handle it.
[03:13:24.084 --> 03:13:26.806]  Screaming at me that long, I'm done talking to you, okay?
[03:13:27.847 --> 03:13:28.928]  And it's so retarded.
[03:13:29.898 --> 03:13:35.506]  When I go on X and I see people going, he works for the Vatican, he works for the Jews, he works for the Masons, what else?
[03:13:35.526 --> 03:13:36.207]  I'm Bill Hicks.
[03:13:36.828 --> 03:13:37.749]  I work for the CIA.
[03:13:38.049 --> 03:13:46.321]  I am 100% my own man, up here for three plus hours already, exposing the tyrants and their projects and what they're doing.
[03:13:47.916 --> 03:13:51.779]  And so, I know it feels good to always say, you're better than me.
[03:13:52.340 --> 03:13:57.484]  And then, you're morally superior, I'm doing bad things, you feel good about yourself, you're better than me.
[03:13:57.504 --> 03:13:59.706]  So let's just say, you, caller, what was his name?
[03:14:00.687 --> 03:14:00.987]  Phoenix?
[03:14:01.467 --> 03:14:03.609]  Phoenix, you are better than me, okay?
[03:14:04.470 --> 03:14:06.391]  And if it makes you feel good, I work for Israel.
[03:14:06.752 --> 03:14:07.532]  That's not true.
[03:14:08.653 --> 03:14:10.294]  And not people like Phoenix, but other people.
[03:14:10.375 --> 03:14:11.616]  I will explain symbols.
[03:14:12.788 --> 03:14:13.128]  On air.
[03:14:13.328 --> 03:14:19.692]  It always happens, and I'll go, to a lot of people, you do the index finger to the thumb.
[03:14:19.812 --> 03:14:27.397]  To me, growing up in TV commercials, you'd see like an Italian food ad and go, mmm, delicioso, or a French ad, bon appetit.
[03:14:28.037 --> 03:14:30.959]  And I remember seeing people at restaurants saying, how do you like the food?
[03:14:31.559 --> 03:14:31.999]  Is it good?
[03:14:32.459 --> 03:14:34.421]  To me, this means A-OK.
[03:14:35.101 --> 03:14:36.202]  That's what it means in sign language.
[03:14:36.782 --> 03:14:39.644]  I was always brought up to think, this means A-OK.
[03:14:40.344 --> 03:14:41.505]  And then this means, I love you.
[03:14:42.421 --> 03:14:47.244]  But people will take this shot of me showing that symbol and say, look, he's doing devil horns on air.
[03:14:47.304 --> 03:14:49.826]  He's a devil, even though I'm showing you the symbols.
[03:14:49.886 --> 03:14:51.387]  That's called dishonesty.
[03:14:52.148 --> 03:14:52.468]  Okay?
[03:14:53.028 --> 03:14:53.669]  And so, great.
[03:14:53.909 --> 03:14:54.769]  You're better than me.
[03:14:55.390 --> 03:14:56.030]  You're real.
[03:14:56.230 --> 03:14:57.591]  I'm not, Phoenix.
[03:14:57.771 --> 03:14:59.673]  And you called in.
[03:14:59.753 --> 03:15:00.974]  Nobody screened your call.
[03:15:01.194 --> 03:15:03.095]  We made sure you had a good, clean phone line.
[03:15:03.135 --> 03:15:03.795]  Put you on the air.
[03:15:04.096 --> 03:15:04.976]  We asked what you were calling about.
[03:15:04.996 --> 03:15:05.657]  But you disagree.
[03:15:05.697 --> 03:15:05.937]  Agree.
[03:15:06.357 --> 03:15:06.918]  Head of the line.
[03:15:08.419 --> 03:15:10.220]  And then, you're about to have a heart attack.
[03:15:11.483 --> 03:15:14.725]  Um, like you're talking to the guy that gave you a poison shots or something.
[03:15:14.765 --> 03:15:21.830]  So man, you just need to not be so angry and you might recruit more people to your way of thinking if you weren't.
[03:15:22.130 --> 03:15:31.376]  I mean, I get screaming for 30 seconds or yelling about something, but yelling at somebody over the telephone, uh, and, and, and, you know, and just trying to fight over things.
[03:15:31.936 --> 03:15:33.417]  Cause I asked you a question you wouldn't answer.
[03:15:33.437 --> 03:15:34.498]  He started hyperventilating.
[03:15:35.626 --> 03:15:41.568]  And maybe that's a question, like, if the Jews were all sent to Pluto, would it fix all our problems?
[03:15:42.668 --> 03:15:44.248]  And the answer is, no, I don't think so.
[03:15:45.028 --> 03:15:56.611]  So, my issue is, I don't care if it's a Jew, or a Chinese person, or a German, or a Hispanic person, I'm gonna judge them off what they stand for and what they do.
[03:15:57.672 --> 03:15:57.932]  Okay?
[03:15:58.863 --> 03:16:00.143]  And so that's what I try to do.
[03:16:01.104 --> 03:16:03.765]  And a big critic of Israel made films about the U.S.S.
[03:16:03.805 --> 03:16:05.966]  Liberty, talked about Israel's stand down.
[03:16:06.446 --> 03:16:09.967]  None of that means anything to the people that just... about Israel all day.
[03:16:10.167 --> 03:16:16.790]  So I'm not here exposing Israel when I expose Israel for bad stuff to prove something to you or to get on your good side.
[03:16:16.850 --> 03:16:18.510]  I'm doing it because I would do that anyways.
[03:16:18.930 --> 03:16:19.771]  That's what I'm doing.
[03:16:20.131 --> 03:16:26.193]  And then you people don't ever even recognize any of that because I don't talk about Jews for four hours a day.
[03:16:28.223 --> 03:16:30.305]  We have guests on that talk about Israel sometimes.
[03:16:30.345 --> 03:16:32.146]  We do it, but I just, I can't do it.
[03:16:33.107 --> 03:16:33.867]  I mean, I'll tell you this.
[03:16:34.388 --> 03:16:35.889]  I just don't have Jews on the brain.
[03:16:36.529 --> 03:16:38.051]  It's just, it's not really my thing.
[03:16:39.672 --> 03:16:42.954]  So, when Israel does something wrong, I call balls and strikes.
[03:16:43.074 --> 03:16:45.236]  And Israel does a lot of evil crap.
[03:16:45.756 --> 03:16:47.538]  And it's heavily infiltrated into our government.
[03:16:47.578 --> 03:16:47.938]  It's terrible.
[03:16:48.378 --> 03:16:49.619]  So are the British intelligence.
[03:16:50.080 --> 03:16:51.121]  So is the CHICOMS.
[03:16:51.281 --> 03:16:54.183]  So is, you know, the big banks, big tech.
[03:16:54.263 --> 03:16:56.485]  I mean, it's a bunch of crooks at the top.
[03:16:57.065 --> 03:16:59.567]  But Netanyahu's got a 20% approval rating in Israel.
[03:16:59.827 --> 03:17:04.271]  A lot of folks don't like him over there, so I just, I'm not gonna put a whole group of people in there and say, well, you're bad.
[03:17:05.011 --> 03:17:10.996]  So, you just gobbled up, you know, I'm trying to talk about shots here, and it just goes back to the Jews did it.
[03:17:11.496 --> 03:17:14.819]  And yeah, Victor Borla is Jewish, and Larry Fink's Jewish, great.
[03:17:15.379 --> 03:17:17.581]  You can go make your own decisions and go, man,
[03:17:19.043 --> 03:17:20.624]  80% of the big pharma heads are Jewish.
[03:17:20.724 --> 03:17:21.765]  That is a little weird.
[03:17:22.465 --> 03:17:23.846]  And we have Gaston to talk about it.
[03:17:23.886 --> 03:17:25.607]  And we should have a discussion about that.
[03:17:25.647 --> 03:17:27.468]  And the ADL's quarterback, get rid of free speech.
[03:17:27.508 --> 03:17:33.932]  I mean, definitely, you know, some of these Jewish groups feel like everybody else has to be slaves because they've been victimized.
[03:17:34.632 --> 03:17:39.795]  And then the victims, and Jews have been victimized some, then a lot of times become the victimizers.
[03:17:40.375 --> 03:17:44.498]  And so I'm not going to be victimized by the ADL or Larry Fink or Albert Bourla.
[03:17:45.754 --> 03:17:50.119]  Okay, and I think they're crooks, but that means nothing to you.
[03:17:50.139 --> 03:17:51.561]  It gets you more, heh, heh, heh, heh.
[03:17:51.841 --> 03:17:54.063]  See, see, I think, and I know, Hitler was bad.
[03:17:54.924 --> 03:18:02.533]  See, so, so, just so you're, you're, oh no, Hitler was great, he did all these great things, and then I see people put their Hitler history out, it's not accurate.
[03:18:03.514 --> 03:18:06.517]  So, you have to understand, I have my views.
[03:18:07.461 --> 03:18:17.384]  And I don't like Stalin, I don't like Mao, I don't like Hitler, I don't like Pol Pot, I don't like Fidel Castro, I don't like Genghis Khan, I don't like those people, okay?
[03:18:18.384 --> 03:18:19.605]  And so that's where I stand now.
[03:18:19.965 --> 03:18:23.146]  I'm gonna try to move on now, here.
[03:18:23.226 --> 03:18:25.166]  I hope Phoenix is okay and hasn't had a heart attack.
[03:18:25.566 --> 03:18:27.547]  Brandon in Boston, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:18:28.827 --> 03:18:33.409]  Hey Alex, just first things first, I've been listening to you and following you since pre-9-11.
[03:18:35.234 --> 03:18:39.777]  I appreciate everything you've been doing for us in our country for the better part of 30 years.
[03:18:41.037 --> 03:18:43.779]  You truly are a light that we all need.
[03:18:44.839 --> 03:18:47.981]  Sorry if I get a little emotional here, but my story kind of goes like this.
[03:18:48.001 --> 03:18:55.705]  I was forced to take a vaccination in order to see my daughter, who had some genetic issues, be born.
[03:18:57.146 --> 03:19:03.489]  And following that, my wife also had to get forced vaccinated while she was pregnant to have these babies born here at a Boston hospital.
[03:19:04.662 --> 03:19:06.423]  Cut quickly to two years later.
[03:19:07.364 --> 03:19:10.726]  I'm currently trying to figure out what type of cancer I now have.
[03:19:11.306 --> 03:19:14.168]  I've been a healthy person for the better part of my entire life.
[03:19:14.808 --> 03:19:16.489]  I would run 20, 30 miles a week.
[03:19:16.769 --> 03:19:16.949]  Wow.
[03:19:17.089 --> 03:19:17.970]  I always ate healthy.
[03:19:18.210 --> 03:19:20.351]  I didn't have any problems in my system whatsoever.
[03:19:21.372 --> 03:19:29.997]  All of a sudden, like I say, cut to two years later and bam, I don't know if I got lymphoma, leukemia or what, but I know they're rushing all my tests.
[03:19:30.297 --> 03:19:33.179]  I've had many, many blood tests over the last
[03:19:34.201 --> 03:19:34.722]  Month and a half.
[03:19:35.542 --> 03:19:38.625]  Many chest x-rays, many pelvic x-rays.
[03:19:39.106 --> 03:19:40.847]  They can't seem to figure out how or why.
[03:19:42.068 --> 03:19:43.290]  Oh yeah, stay there.
[03:19:43.310 --> 03:19:43.810]  Don't hang up.
[03:19:43.850 --> 03:19:44.210]  Don't hang up.
[03:19:44.230 --> 03:19:45.271]  I wasn't looking at the clock.
[03:19:45.291 --> 03:19:46.032]  I've got to get a break, Brandon.
[03:19:46.052 --> 03:19:46.433]  Don't hang up.
[03:19:47.353 --> 03:19:48.955]  This is what the oncologists have told me.
[03:19:49.455 --> 03:19:52.738]  When my wife's dad was dying in the hospital, they were like, oh yeah, we watch the show.
[03:19:52.779 --> 03:19:53.860]  There are a lot of new cancers.
[03:19:54.932 --> 03:19:57.494]  There are all these new... It just grows weird tumors all over you.
[03:19:57.514 --> 03:20:00.676]  There's ways... I'm not your doctor, but it may not even be cancer.
[03:20:00.777 --> 03:20:02.398]  They're just gonna call the lumps cancer.
[03:20:02.598 --> 03:20:03.098]  The year is 2030.
[03:20:03.238 --> 03:20:10.184]  The World Economic Forum's agenda unfolds, ushering in an era where AI seeks to dominate.
[03:20:10.304 --> 03:20:13.887]  In this world of steel and algorithms, there's a ray of hope for humanity.
[03:20:14.147 --> 03:20:16.729]  It's bodies from InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:20:16.909 --> 03:20:21.856]  This revolutionary blend of ancient herbs and modern science stands as a symbol of resistance.
[03:20:22.076 --> 03:20:23.859]  It's not just about combating inflammation.
[03:20:24.139 --> 03:20:27.044]  It's about making your body feel invincible in the InfoWar.
[03:20:27.144 --> 03:20:31.190]  Visit InfoWarStore.com and order yours before the sale is terminated.
[03:20:32.907 --> 03:20:34.848]  All right, Brandon in Boston, start over.
[03:20:34.928 --> 03:20:43.751]  So you were saying you had something like a baby that had some medical issues, correct me if I'm wrong, and then the hospital pressured you and lied to you, said you had to have shots, you and your wife be around your baby.
[03:20:44.512 --> 03:20:48.273]  And then now they're just now telling you, the oncologist, it looks like you've got some type of cancer.
[03:20:48.693 --> 03:20:51.674]  I'm not obviously diagnosing, I'm not a doctor, and if I was, I couldn't do it from afar.
[03:20:51.714 --> 03:20:55.436]  But the numbers I see is these create a lot of clots in things in the body.
[03:20:55.996 --> 03:21:01.061]  They even said when the shot started three and a half years ago in mainstream news, Oh, be ready for a lot of weird clots and things.
[03:21:01.121 --> 03:21:05.065]  But you know, tell your doctor that's not really cancer as you can tell your doctor.
[03:21:05.685 --> 03:21:08.068]  So yes, it does cause all sorts of clots to grow.
[03:21:08.108 --> 03:21:09.409]  It triggers cancers.
[03:21:09.849 --> 03:21:11.071]  It restarts old cancers.
[03:21:11.131 --> 03:21:12.672]  It makes the cancers turbo cancer.
[03:21:13.333 --> 03:21:14.894]  The head of the German oncology.
[03:21:15.695 --> 03:21:17.296]  Yeah, you hit it right on the head.
[03:21:17.316 --> 03:21:18.817]  That's exactly what I got going on.
[03:21:18.837 --> 03:21:19.857]  My story there.
[03:21:19.877 --> 03:21:23.620]  Like we said, it was a forced vaccination in order to see this baby be born.
[03:21:23.680 --> 03:21:31.184]  And of course, I'm not going to not go in there and be with my wife to see my baby who has had a genetic disorder, which
[03:21:44.201 --> 03:21:45.641]  Just on the good side of things.
[03:21:45.681 --> 03:21:46.322]  She does well.
[03:21:46.362 --> 03:21:48.362]  She's not having any issues with seizures anymore.
[03:21:48.402 --> 03:21:50.623]  So Godspeed.
[03:21:50.663 --> 03:21:52.584]  She's going to do well and have a great life.
[03:21:53.244 --> 03:21:55.285]  And hopefully I get to be around for all that.
[03:21:55.365 --> 03:21:59.346]  But that's all I really wanted to get off my chest to you.
[03:22:00.086 --> 03:22:03.127]  It was more so to say we appreciate my family.
[03:22:03.147 --> 03:22:04.528]  I appreciate what you do.
[03:22:05.808 --> 03:22:07.248]  And just keep fighting that fight, man.
[03:22:07.689 --> 03:22:08.989]  We'll support you in any way we can.
[03:22:09.795 --> 03:22:15.958]  Well brother, I don't know all the details, but you mentioned they can't figure out what it is, they're doing all these tests.
[03:22:15.998 --> 03:22:28.325]  That's what I've been seeing in the literature, I don't know if that's your case, is it grows all sorts of weird clots, it does all sorts of weird things and they will misdiagnose you, the same medical system that terrorized you into taking the shot and did all of this.
[03:22:29.726 --> 03:22:35.389]  Well, you know, I'm not saying what you should do, but there's a lot of things that obviously are going to hurt you that are.
[03:22:35.409 --> 03:22:37.511]  I mean, I would listen to Dr. Peter McCullough and others.
[03:22:37.911 --> 03:22:43.035]  There's a lot of detox things, a lot of anti spike things, you know, things like nitric boost.
[03:22:43.055 --> 03:22:46.117]  I'm not saying that's going to, you know, handle your problems, but, uh,
[03:22:46.477 --> 03:22:47.738]  Who knows what'll happen to the body.
[03:22:48.478 --> 03:22:52.080]  I had Peter McCullough on last week, or was it even Monday?
[03:22:52.180 --> 03:22:53.641]  Tom Fly's was Friday.
[03:22:54.101 --> 03:22:57.543]  And, you know, he was talking about how to clear up a lot of the stuff that's also being misdiagnosed.
[03:22:57.584 --> 03:22:59.004]  So, be safe, brother.
[03:22:59.485 --> 03:23:00.565]  And we love you and we appreciate you.
[03:23:01.686 --> 03:23:02.486]  Alright, I appreciate you.
[03:23:02.947 --> 03:23:03.487]  Trump forever.
[03:23:03.527 --> 03:23:03.807]  Thank you.
[03:23:03.987 --> 03:23:04.708]  Thank you, man.
[03:23:06.088 --> 03:23:06.629]  Great shape.
[03:23:06.709 --> 03:23:07.649]  Runs 30 miles a week.
[03:23:09.130 --> 03:23:10.111]  Probably pretty young.
[03:23:10.211 --> 03:23:10.911]  Probably younger than me.
[03:23:11.852 --> 03:23:13.253]  Sounds like he's probably 40, 35.
[03:23:13.313 --> 03:23:13.613]  Who knows?
[03:23:13.673 --> 03:23:14.233]  I should've asked him.
[03:23:14.593 --> 03:23:15.134]  He's got cancer!
[03:23:16.067 --> 03:23:16.807]  Hey, can you hear me, Alex?
[03:23:16.827 --> 03:23:17.507]  How's it going?
[03:23:17.527 --> 03:23:18.768]  Thank you so much for taking my call.
[03:23:18.808 --> 03:23:21.088]  I really appreciate it.
[03:23:21.128 --> 03:23:24.749]  You're an awesome dude, and I don't know where the world would be without you, man.
[03:23:24.769 --> 03:23:27.310]  As far as the COVID shots, I've
[03:23:41.181 --> 03:23:46.803]  My wife's Nana's boyfriend died pretty much drop dead day after he got it.
[03:23:47.984 --> 03:23:54.427]  That was pretty dramatic, but my Nana is super liberal, so she wouldn't do anything to push and kind of look into it.
[03:23:54.587 --> 03:23:56.127]  So it was always just a mystery.
[03:23:57.928 --> 03:23:59.949]  But yeah, man, I was in the military.
[03:24:00.009 --> 03:24:01.089]  I didn't get vaccinated.
[03:24:01.149 --> 03:24:03.710]  I got out after the end of 2018, so I didn't
[03:24:05.603 --> 03:24:08.764]  Have to get forced to get it, but they forced us to get all that other crap.
[03:24:09.044 --> 03:24:15.847]  I don't know how many vaccinations it is, but I went overseas as well, so I had to get... Well, those were vaccinations, though a lot of them were experimental.
[03:24:17.007 --> 03:24:17.768]  Right, exactly.
[03:24:17.788 --> 03:24:19.288]  But this is not a, quote, vaccine.
[03:24:19.328 --> 03:24:21.529]  This is a deadly gene therapy.
[03:24:22.649 --> 03:24:24.230]  Right, and I'm glad I didn't get that.
[03:24:24.250 --> 03:24:31.873]  I mean... But I've developed fibromyalgia at the end, and I got retired, so...
[03:24:32.588 --> 03:24:37.930]  I've been dealing with that with the doctors, and they think more is going on, and I've just gotten over the poking and prodding.
[03:24:37.950 --> 03:24:41.772]  Yeah, I mean, I don't honestly care at this point.
[03:24:41.832 --> 03:24:43.613]  I'm trying to just live my best life.
[03:24:43.693 --> 03:24:48.235]  I'm a fishing guide, and I'm originally from Georgia, and I just hate Washington.
[03:24:48.275 --> 03:24:49.215]  It sucks so much.
[03:24:49.295 --> 03:24:49.976]  It does, brother.
[03:24:50.076 --> 03:24:50.916]  Well, God bless you.
[03:24:50.936 --> 03:24:59.100]  I'm going to play a clip here from Tim Macy, and he is an officer in the Medical Corps in the Air Force talking about the record level and showing
[03:25:00.565 --> 03:25:07.387]  Maybe, excuse me, showing the record level devastation in their internal memos from the shots.
[03:25:07.427 --> 03:25:07.828]  Here it is.
[03:25:09.288 --> 03:25:20.752]  So you may have seen my wife's recent post, and I want to elaborate on that and give an example as to why reinstatement, back pay, and apologies isn't enough.
[03:25:23.436 --> 03:25:35.490]  So in July, Undersecretary Cisneros acknowledged the DMED data, the database working properly, and also acknowledged things such as myocarditis rising 151%.
[03:25:35.530 --> 03:25:36.131]  So what I did, I went in today.
[03:25:40.103 --> 03:25:40.763]  I'm doing the same thing.
[03:25:40.803 --> 03:25:41.464]  Five-year average.
[03:25:41.524 --> 03:25:43.205]  However, I'm comparing it to 2022.
[03:25:43.905 --> 03:25:49.688]  And I only am using fixed-wing pilots and helicopter pilots in active duty.
[03:25:50.268 --> 03:25:51.829]  So we got hypertensive disease, 36%.
[03:25:51.869 --> 03:25:53.650]  Ischemic heart disease, 69%.
[03:25:53.770 --> 03:25:54.550]  Pulmonary heart disease, 62%.
[03:25:54.610 --> 03:25:55.050]  Heart failure, 973%.
[03:25:55.090 --> 03:25:58.192]  Other forms of heart disease, 63%.
[03:26:09.539 --> 03:26:11.500]  Cardiomyopathy, 152%.
[03:26:15.842 --> 03:26:18.303]  By the way, before I forget, let me just tell the crew, I think I forgot to tell them this.
[03:26:18.683 --> 03:26:21.004]  Tommy Robinson is on at noon tomorrow, just so you guys don't forget.
[03:26:21.024 --> 03:26:21.904]  I forgot to tell you.
[03:26:22.604 --> 03:26:23.144]  Big updates.
[03:26:23.505 --> 03:26:25.405]  Let's go to Joe in Alabama.
[03:26:25.945 --> 03:26:26.706]  Joe, you're on the air.
[03:26:26.726 --> 03:26:27.026]  Welcome.
[03:26:29.247 --> 03:26:29.727]  Yes, Alex.
[03:26:29.747 --> 03:26:30.207]  Can you hear me?
[03:26:30.247 --> 03:26:30.527]  Yes, sir.
[03:26:30.567 --> 03:26:30.827]  Go ahead.
[03:26:32.408 --> 03:26:36.289]  So, I just wanted to talk about the vaccine my wife got.
[03:26:36.530 --> 03:26:37.650]  She actually got three shots.
[03:26:38.686 --> 03:26:44.349]  So, the last shot she got was a little over a year ago, but she didn't know nothing about it.
[03:26:44.389 --> 03:26:48.852]  She was, of course, you know, coerced to taking it by her job because she works for the government school.
[03:26:48.892 --> 03:26:53.815]  So, anyway, so after we got married, that's when I found out she was vaccinated three times.
[03:26:54.475 --> 03:26:57.397]  I haven't got any shots, thankfully, since the day one I came out.
[03:26:57.417 --> 03:26:58.778]  I just had a bad feeling about it.
[03:26:59.859 --> 03:27:05.642]  So, right after I found out she got her shots, I forced her to go to the doctor, do blood work.
[03:27:06.514 --> 03:27:15.220]  And the particular test I told her to take is the D-Dimer test, which is, I don't know if you're familiar with it, it checks how your blood's clotting.
[03:27:16.881 --> 03:27:20.664]  So, our doctor... You're talking about a D-Dimer test?
[03:27:21.605 --> 03:27:22.445]  Yes, that's right.
[03:27:23.166 --> 03:27:24.787]  It shows you have blood clots, yeah.
[03:27:25.808 --> 03:27:35.875]  Right, so the doctor just looked at her and she, you know, she kind of thought we're crazy, I'm crazy, because, you know, my wife, she's really young, she's healthy, never had any health problems.
[03:27:36.687 --> 03:27:39.108]  They do her D-dimer test, it comes back elevated.
[03:27:39.769 --> 03:27:40.769]  That's the first marker.
[03:27:40.809 --> 03:27:51.156]  The second test she got done, um, I can't remember what the... Listen, they had, this happened three years ago, they had Canadian and British labs, the same findings, and I've seen other ones since then.
[03:27:51.636 --> 03:28:02.382]  They did it, and 64% in both the UK and Canada of the people that took Moderna or Pfizer came back with D-dimer, meaning blood clots within a week of the shots.
[03:28:02.442 --> 03:28:03.323]  I mean, this is a fact.
[03:28:04.457 --> 03:28:05.618]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:28:05.678 --> 03:28:07.499]  And I told my mom about it.
[03:28:07.559 --> 03:28:09.721]  You know, my brother got vaccinated.
[03:28:09.741 --> 03:28:10.721]  He's a nurse as well.
[03:28:11.002 --> 03:28:13.583]  And I told him to get his blood checked, and he doesn't want to.
[03:28:13.623 --> 03:28:14.724]  He thinks I'm crazy, too.
[03:28:14.864 --> 03:28:19.427]  Oh yeah, because it is crazy that the government and Big Pharma would try to kill you, but they are.
[03:28:19.507 --> 03:28:24.371]  Bill Gates says he wants to kill people and wants to reduce the population, but he wants to give you a shot to live longer.
[03:28:24.391 --> 03:28:25.932]  2 plus 2, folks!
[03:28:27.132 --> 03:28:27.653]  Exactly.
[03:28:28.653 --> 03:28:28.854]  Right.
[03:28:29.739 --> 03:28:39.108]  My question is, I've been trying to search online and there's just so much information out there, but I did try Dr. Peter McCullough's vitamins that he's been selling.
[03:28:39.148 --> 03:28:40.629]  I've been buying a three-pack.
[03:28:41.390 --> 03:28:44.293]  So my wife started taking that a little like six months ago.
[03:28:44.313 --> 03:28:48.236]  I also put her on the ProArgent 9.
[03:28:48.296 --> 03:28:51.419]  It's basically, I don't know if you heard about the product, it's by Synergy.
[03:28:52.740 --> 03:28:54.422]  It's kind of like the product you sell.
[03:28:55.433 --> 03:28:56.614]  It's supposed to thin your blood?
[03:28:57.115 --> 03:29:03.100]  Yeah, listen, I'm no rocket scientist, and I'm not saying any of this is a panacea, so I'm not giving medical advice.
[03:29:04.441 --> 03:29:09.245]  High quality, 95% curcuminoid or any turmeric, period, is great as a mitigator.
[03:29:10.106 --> 03:29:12.548]  I know Dr. Minkowitz says our nitric boost is a great formula.
[03:29:12.568 --> 03:29:13.949]  It's got everything you need in it for that.
[03:29:14.850 --> 03:29:17.552]  But, you know, regardless, the smartest thing to do is not take the shot.
[03:29:18.653 --> 03:29:20.495]  But I understand people got intimidated into it.
[03:29:21.135 --> 03:29:22.937]  If I was you, I'd get a lawyer and sue these people.
[03:29:24.338 --> 03:29:32.101]  Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what to do because I'm at this point, I don't know if I need to get life insurance for her, you know, plan the funeral.
[03:29:32.161 --> 03:29:37.103]  I don't know what's going to happen, but the vaccine she got was three different ones.
[03:29:37.583 --> 03:29:38.523]  It wasn't the same one.
[03:29:38.563 --> 03:29:42.325]  She got a Moderna, she got Pfizer, and she got some other vaccine from China.
[03:29:43.005 --> 03:29:43.345]  Wow!
[03:29:43.625 --> 03:29:45.186]  Who the hell was pushing all that on her?
[03:29:46.195 --> 03:29:48.155]  Yeah, the school did, the government school here.
[03:29:48.495 --> 03:29:49.436]  Geez, I know, that's the thing.
[03:29:49.476 --> 03:29:50.716]  The schools are like, they're not even doctors.
[03:29:51.056 --> 03:29:52.676]  Oh, we'll just mix them and see what they do.
[03:29:52.756 --> 03:30:03.938]  And again, all of them, whether it was J&J, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna, the Pentagon came out before they released it and ordered them all to be ready to have the same effects.
[03:30:03.958 --> 03:30:11.739]  So whether it's an mRNA shot, Pfizer, Moderna, or a virus vector shot, J&J, AstraZeneca, they don't put it in via mRNA.
[03:30:12.019 --> 03:30:14.160]  They have a chimpanzee virus
[03:30:15.481 --> 03:30:15.941]  One of them does.
[03:30:16.482 --> 03:30:24.031]  Loaded with the DNA, RNA, and it shoots it into the cell and makes your cell create spike protein.
[03:30:24.331 --> 03:30:32.881]  So the Pentagon actually developed all this and then put the orders out to companies saying, however you do it, we want the body to create these cancer proteins.
[03:30:33.675 --> 03:30:35.816]  Oh yeah, she's, her health has been, she's got COVID three times already.
[03:30:35.836 --> 03:30:36.436]  Those shots don't help.
[03:30:55.945 --> 03:30:58.726]  He's been having this cough, dry cough, since I ever met her.
[03:30:58.786 --> 03:31:01.707]  And actually this morning she woke up and it sounds like she's got pneumonia.
[03:31:02.228 --> 03:31:03.848]  So, she's supposed to be traveling.
[03:31:03.888 --> 03:31:06.769]  I wanted her to stay home, but she... Well, let me tell you this.
[03:31:06.809 --> 03:31:07.950]  And it's not because I sell it.
[03:31:08.830 --> 03:31:10.451]  You don't need to buy her X2 or X3.
[03:31:10.511 --> 03:31:15.893]  If she has an iodine deficiency, that triggers so many autoimmune disorders and issues.
[03:31:16.813 --> 03:31:18.514]  You can buy Himalayan salt.
[03:31:19.895 --> 03:31:20.435]  It has to be.
[03:31:20.755 --> 03:31:22.636]  That's the name of it, but it doesn't have to be from the Himalayas.
[03:31:22.656 --> 03:31:23.556]  That's the term I knows.
[03:31:23.876 --> 03:31:26.516]  It's pink, and the really good ones have little purple flecks in it.
[03:31:26.597 --> 03:31:28.657]  That's close to atomic iodine.
[03:31:29.277 --> 03:31:33.498]  Now that that's so you you need that X two or X three is even stronger.
[03:31:33.818 --> 03:31:34.418]  It's the same thing.
[03:31:34.438 --> 03:31:35.278]  Just concentrated.
[03:31:36.019 --> 03:31:38.359]  Um, also, you don't get it from us.
[03:31:38.419 --> 03:31:45.321]  Just get organic 1000 milligram vitamin C, preferably from rosehips with zinc to take it into the cells.
[03:31:46.281 --> 03:31:46.401]  And
[03:31:47.445 --> 03:31:52.508]  I'm just telling you get your wife on 1000 milligram vitamin C. Okay, you don't need to get it from us.
[03:31:52.589 --> 03:31:53.349]  We sell a great one.
[03:31:53.869 --> 03:32:01.494]  But whatever you do, make sure it's organic vitamin C. And you can take more than 1000 milligrams, the most you'll get if you took like 3000 milligrams is diarrhea.
[03:32:01.774 --> 03:32:03.636]  So the line is pulling on a Nobel Prize.
[03:32:04.056 --> 03:32:08.659]  There's basically you can't take enough vitamin C. A lot of people I know that have long COVID or have from the shot.
[03:32:09.119 --> 03:32:10.640]  I mean, I go to a clinic once a month to
[03:32:10.680 --> 03:32:13.582]  Hey Alex, so good to be with you and thank you so much for you and all the team does.
[03:32:37.475 --> 03:32:47.060]  I'm looking at my COVID-19 vaccination record card from the CDC, and I keep it with me to remind me, don't fall for this nonsense again.
[03:32:47.140 --> 03:32:55.965]  I work for a big utility, and we were strongly encouraged to get these shots.
[03:32:56.645 --> 03:33:02.028]  And I got mine April, first one, it's a Moderna, and I got my shot April 2021.
[03:33:02.468 --> 03:33:03.348]  And then the second one,
[03:33:05.487 --> 03:33:05.927]  In May.
[03:33:06.307 --> 03:33:07.827]  And, you know, I should have smelled the rat.
[03:33:08.868 --> 03:33:13.549]  You know, when we got these shots, we got them in a cafeteria right at the utility.
[03:33:14.229 --> 03:33:20.010]  And they said, well, and the military came in and gave those vaccines to us.
[03:33:20.910 --> 03:33:24.491]  And, you know, you can't leave after you get it.
[03:33:24.511 --> 03:33:28.752]  We want you to stay here and, you know, sit for about 15 minutes.
[03:33:29.292 --> 03:33:31.092]  And, you know, and I did it twice.
[03:33:31.570 --> 03:33:36.132]  Did it twice, because I was really fearful of losing my job.
[03:33:36.172 --> 03:33:38.474]  I didn't know what was going to happen.
[03:33:39.074 --> 03:33:44.076]  It's very insidious the way the company created the class system.
[03:33:45.397 --> 03:33:50.300]  If you get the shots, you're fully vaccinated, you don't have to wear a mask in the building.
[03:33:51.000 --> 03:33:54.082]  But if you didn't, then you've got to wear a mask.
[03:33:54.662 --> 03:33:56.883]  And so people would look at each other a little funny.
[03:33:57.043 --> 03:33:57.864]  You know what I mean?
[03:33:57.904 --> 03:34:00.585]  If you didn't have a mask on, oh, there's one of the
[03:34:01.204 --> 03:34:04.086]  Vaccines, you know, deniers and that type of thing.
[03:34:04.667 --> 03:34:09.710]  But after the second shot, I started getting a regular heartbeat.
[03:34:10.811 --> 03:34:16.935]  I called a doctor and they said, well, you know, we'll monitor the condition and, you know, give us a call back if it worsens.
[03:34:17.015 --> 03:34:18.596]  And thank God it didn't worsen.
[03:34:18.636 --> 03:34:26.902]  But then I started, I started to injure myself, tear my Achilles tendon, tear a ligament in my elbow.
[03:34:29.705 --> 03:34:32.187]  And by the way, that's the third most common thing.
[03:34:44.949 --> 03:34:48.290]  Blood clots and heart attacks, cardiovascular strokes, that whole area.
[03:34:48.931 --> 03:34:52.312]  And then the next thing is kidney and liver problems.
[03:34:52.332 --> 03:34:58.135]  But the next most common thing is serious joint pain because you never know where the spike protein is going to start producing.
[03:34:58.695 --> 03:35:02.296]  It starts doing it, you know, and it's just, it's, it's incredible what it does.
[03:35:02.917 --> 03:35:03.397]  Yeah.
[03:35:03.497 --> 03:35:04.697]  And it's a plug for the product.
[03:35:05.017 --> 03:35:11.000]  I'm telling you, if it wasn't for turmeric 95 or bodies, the nitric oxide, the fish oil,
[03:35:11.702 --> 03:35:16.907]  Nerve Renew, Joint Relief, all that stuff helped me immeasurably.
[03:35:17.007 --> 03:35:18.288]  I can't tell you how much.
[03:35:18.388 --> 03:35:22.031]  Oh listen, if you go to some billionaire or globalist house, it's nothing but high-end supplements.
[03:35:22.692 --> 03:35:24.153]  These are all concentrates.
[03:35:24.854 --> 03:35:28.797]  Drugs are all copies and twisted patented forms of what's in Mother Nature.
[03:35:29.158 --> 03:35:30.999]  The Amazon rainforest has everything we need.
[03:35:31.660 --> 03:35:33.922]  And so anything we sell is badass.
[03:35:34.602 --> 03:35:36.204]  Because let me tell you something, I could get
[03:35:37.617 --> 03:35:40.539]  Our supplements for cheaper than what the bottle cost.
[03:35:41.240 --> 03:35:50.607]  Instead, take DNA Force Plus, highest quality PQQ CoQ10 and stuff, so it's costing us, you know, depending on the batch, like $25, $30 a bottle, you know.
[03:35:51.007 --> 03:35:53.729]  I mean, because it is the best, and that's what we do.
[03:35:53.949 --> 03:36:04.818]  We, I refuse, we're thinking about the people who want discount brands, still getting quality, but not super high-end, and we can cut the prices in half, you know, because it'll cost us, you know, $10 a bottle, not $25 a bottle, but yeah.
[03:36:05.518 --> 03:36:06.159]  Anything else, brother?
[03:36:07.330 --> 03:36:17.929]  Yeah, one nice little kicker was that after you got fully vaccinated, we were encouraged to take a picture of your vaccine card that shows you the lot number.
[03:36:17.949 --> 03:36:18.771]  And put it online!
[03:36:20.532 --> 03:36:21.972]  And you send that to it.
[03:36:22.112 --> 03:36:23.953]  And I know it violated the HIPAA law.
[03:36:23.993 --> 03:36:26.555]  But I even did that like a good little German soldier.
[03:36:26.595 --> 03:36:27.936]  You know what I mean?
[03:36:27.996 --> 03:36:29.076]  So mad at myself again.
[03:36:29.116 --> 03:36:30.137]  Well, that's how they sell it.
[03:36:30.177 --> 03:36:32.498]  Protect your wife, protect your kids, protect your family.
[03:36:32.818 --> 03:36:34.239]  Leonardo Samaras gives it to his son.
[03:36:34.259 --> 03:36:36.740]  He's dead three days later playing basketball.
[03:36:36.860 --> 03:36:37.681]  God bless you, sir.
[03:36:38.021 --> 03:36:39.302]  And I'm glad to hear you're doing better.
[03:36:39.382 --> 03:36:39.742]  We love you.
[03:36:39.782 --> 03:36:40.362]  We appreciate you.
[03:36:40.963 --> 03:36:41.843]  Look, don't feel bad.
[03:36:41.943 --> 03:36:44.544]  I used to be, you know, not as smart as I am.
[03:36:45.225 --> 03:36:46.205]  I mean, I've learned more all the time.
[03:36:46.245 --> 03:36:46.906]  It's just part of life.
[03:36:47.625 --> 03:36:48.609]  That's why we're not God.
[03:36:48.749 --> 03:36:49.251]  Far from it.
[03:36:49.713 --> 03:36:51.198]  Austin and Tennessee, you're on the air.
[03:36:51.238 --> 03:36:51.519]  Welcome.
[03:36:52.813 --> 03:36:53.734]  Hey, Alex.
[03:36:53.894 --> 03:36:54.474]  Love you, brother.
[03:36:54.854 --> 03:36:56.735]  Always praying for you and that crew, of course.
[03:36:57.836 --> 03:37:01.658]  Just wanted to give you kind of a personal testimony in regards to my family.
[03:37:01.718 --> 03:37:08.642]  So, several close family members, of course, received their vaccines, quote-unquote, in 2021.
[03:37:08.882 --> 03:37:17.347]  And then instantly, mother-in-law, aunt, you know, get skin cancer multiple times, almost at the exact same time.
[03:37:18.488 --> 03:37:20.349]  And now here recently, I have an uncle.
[03:37:20.709 --> 03:37:21.470]  He's just turned 60.
[03:37:22.697 --> 03:37:25.898]  And he was diagnosed with pancreatic and colon cancer.
[03:37:25.939 --> 03:37:39.304]  Now, he was a big vaccine advocate, got all the boosters, and the doctors are telling him, here's what's weird, is that they're the same type of cancer, but they occurred separately, and they didn't spread to one another.
[03:37:39.985 --> 03:37:46.207]  Something that they've not really seen, of course, up until recently, which just blows my mind.
[03:37:47.776 --> 03:37:50.021]  Well, that's what I was saying to the earlier caller.
[03:37:50.422 --> 03:37:51.986]  They're like, we've never seen these cancers.
[03:37:52.026 --> 03:37:52.727]  We don't know what it is.
[03:37:52.768 --> 03:37:53.589]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:37:54.151 --> 03:37:55.153]  I've talked to oncologists.
[03:37:55.173 --> 03:37:55.694]  The studies are out.
[03:37:55.714 --> 03:37:57.859]  There's all these weird new things they've never seen.
[03:37:59.698 --> 03:38:02.259]  Yes, it's incredibly alarming.
[03:38:02.339 --> 03:38:08.862]  And then, of course, you know, a lot of these individuals continue to get vaccinated and continue to get COVID.
[03:38:09.602 --> 03:38:12.603]  And they can't realize that, hey, they're jacking themselves up.
[03:38:13.184 --> 03:38:20.126]  And the sickest thing is our daughters, pediatricians, the office, just all of them in general, they keep pushing this.
[03:38:20.186 --> 03:38:24.288]  Of course, we're not doing that to our children, my wife and I, but
[03:38:24.768 --> 03:38:27.831]  They are, they're just, they're not going to stop.
[03:38:28.031 --> 03:38:34.717]  And, you know, why I think Info Well, you know, you know, the doctor's offices all get paid massive amounts of money per person they inject.
[03:38:35.958 --> 03:38:37.159]  Yes, yes.
[03:38:37.339 --> 03:38:45.686]  And I think when I called into you a few years ago, we'd even said that, hey, they might even secretly try to get the vaccine into your child without your consent.
[03:38:45.706 --> 03:38:47.107]  And now they're saying they're doing it.
[03:38:48.228 --> 03:38:49.950]  Yes, yes, exactly.
[03:38:49.970 --> 03:38:51.031]  It's all coming true.
[03:38:52.046 --> 03:38:58.468]  It's just horrible because we're going to destroy our generation coming up if we allow this to happen.
[03:38:58.528 --> 03:39:05.230]  So I just love you guys keep fighting because obviously the vaccines aren't the only way that they're trying to kill us.
[03:39:06.131 --> 03:39:10.732]  So I'm just going to continue listening, supporting the show and praying for you guys.
[03:39:11.232 --> 03:39:12.112]  God bless you, Austin.
[03:39:12.132 --> 03:39:14.293]  We're going to talk to John, Max and Natalie.
[03:39:14.313 --> 03:39:16.354]  Got to move quick as the show is almost over, but let me just say this now.
[03:39:17.386 --> 03:39:19.106]  You have to admit the globalists are out to kill you.
[03:39:19.126 --> 03:39:20.927]  You have to read their own admissions where it's their plan.
[03:39:21.307 --> 03:39:24.708]  You have to see Pfizer saying their new business plan is increased cancer.
[03:39:24.988 --> 03:39:27.068]  That's their new big business with their stock going up.
[03:39:27.609 --> 03:39:32.350]  This is pre-planned and you've got to all become Tucker Carlson or Alex Jones.
[03:39:32.870 --> 03:39:41.112]  You've got to all stand up and march out of your bunkers and face these people down.
[03:39:42.048 --> 03:39:47.430]  They can't have America surviving and have a world government, because Americans might remember who they are.
[03:39:48.251 --> 03:39:54.734]  Americans might decide to stand up, and the New World Order cannot have that.
[03:39:54.814 --> 03:39:58.275]  So, we all need to become info warriors today.
[03:39:58.595 --> 03:39:59.896]  That is the big commission.
[03:40:00.967 --> 03:40:04.930]  God gives you the commission to save souls, and God wants you to march out and stand against these tyrants.
[03:40:05.290 --> 03:40:07.752]  Please, pledge yourself to the fight against tyranny today.
[03:40:08.253 --> 03:40:11.175]  Speak up, stand up, support people that are telling the truth.
[03:40:11.715 --> 03:40:15.498]  Pray every day for a global awakening, and we can come through this together.
[03:40:15.538 --> 03:40:19.662]  But this is the new type of war, a covert war, a soft kill operation.
[03:40:20.002 --> 03:40:23.285]  John in Scotland, if I saw you in Scotland, I would have gone to you earlier, I apologize.
[03:40:23.625 --> 03:40:25.646]  I wasn't reading where people were calling from, just their names.
[03:40:26.047 --> 03:40:27.068]  Scott, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:40:28.489 --> 03:40:28.669]  Hello?
[03:40:29.389 --> 03:40:29.930]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[03:40:31.195 --> 03:40:32.716]  Hi, it's John from Scotland.
[03:40:32.776 --> 03:40:33.417]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:40:33.517 --> 03:40:34.077]  Welcome, sir.
[03:40:35.078 --> 03:40:35.519]  How you doing?
[03:40:35.579 --> 03:40:45.967]  If you could bring up my Twitter, Alex, it's bringthenoise underscore X. What you will see is you will see me confronting the Prime Minister in our country, in the United Kingdom.
[03:40:46.247 --> 03:40:55.074]  It was myself that confronted Rishi Sunak in the UK, trying to get help and support for people that have been affected by that vaccine.
[03:40:55.575 --> 03:40:58.077]  I nearly, that vaccine nearly killed me, Alex.
[03:40:58.607 --> 03:41:03.589]  And I'm standing here strong in Scotland trying to raise as much awareness as possible.
[03:41:03.629 --> 03:41:04.469]  Bring the noise underscore x.
[03:41:15.171 --> 03:41:20.598]  Yeah, if you look at my first video, you will see me confronting the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
[03:41:20.899 --> 03:41:26.486]  The reason I say bring the noise, Alex, is because they want us all to suffer in silence.
[03:41:26.726 --> 03:41:30.992]  They want the vaccine injured and bereaved all to be swept under the carpet.
[03:41:31.252 --> 03:41:33.335]  And this just goes to show the world
[03:41:33.775 --> 03:41:40.220]  This goes to show the world that this government and all of these governments do not care about anybody at all.
[03:41:40.480 --> 03:41:47.466]  Because if that Prime Minister or the current Prime Minister in our country cared about us, they would have got in touch with myself.
[03:41:47.706 --> 03:41:48.947]  But they never, Alex.
[03:41:49.307 --> 03:41:50.188]  They ignored me.
[03:41:50.408 --> 03:41:54.651]  And they still continue to ignore the vaccine-injured and bereaved in this country.
[03:41:54.992 --> 03:41:57.534]  I will never stop shouting from the rooftops.
[03:41:57.674 --> 03:41:59.135]  I will continue to bring the noise.
[03:41:59.537 --> 03:42:03.059]  These guys have blood on their hands, and I don't care at this point.
[03:42:03.099 --> 03:42:06.220]  By the way, we pulled it up, so we're live now, but put a note in there.
[03:42:06.240 --> 03:42:13.564]  When we post this to X, with your call, we will clip this clip of you confronting these monsters in there.
[03:42:14.644 --> 03:42:15.065]  Great points.
[03:42:15.105 --> 03:42:15.525]  Anything else?
[03:42:15.545 --> 03:42:17.706]  What happened when you took the shot?
[03:42:17.766 --> 03:42:19.307]  I took the vaccine, Alex.
[03:42:19.367 --> 03:42:20.927]  I was bedridden for 14 months.
[03:42:20.967 --> 03:42:25.410]  I had a condition called POTS, which is Posterior Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome.
[03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:27.991]  Neurological issues, gut issues.
[03:42:28.991 --> 03:42:30.353]  The list goes on, my friend.
[03:42:30.413 --> 03:42:31.494]  I was in a wheelchair.
[03:42:31.794 --> 03:42:36.901]  I've spent about £40,000, which is about $60,000, to try and get my life back.
[03:42:37.261 --> 03:42:43.349]  I've done so much to try and raise awareness, just like yourself, Alex, and trying to warn people about this poison.
[03:42:43.750 --> 03:42:45.212]  And the honest answer is,
[03:42:45.712 --> 03:42:47.933]  Well brother, I'd like to have you on as a guest.
[03:42:47.953 --> 03:42:49.013]  What's your full name?
[03:42:49.033 --> 03:42:50.294]  We see you all over the news.
[03:43:05.202 --> 03:43:08.787]  Yeah, they failed to kill you, so they wanted to kill your ability to fight back.
[03:43:22.403 --> 03:43:23.624]  Listen, we'll get your name and number.
[03:43:23.644 --> 03:43:24.565]  I'd like to have you on as a guest.
[03:43:24.665 --> 03:43:25.927]  I apologize to Max and Natalie.
[03:43:25.967 --> 03:43:26.628]  I tried my best.
[03:43:27.188 --> 03:43:28.870]  I gave the crazy guy too much time up front.
[03:43:28.950 --> 03:43:29.531]  That's my fault.
[03:43:29.631 --> 03:43:31.393]  You'll whine online and say it was censored.
[03:43:31.913 --> 03:43:32.434]  That's the way it is.
[03:43:32.454 --> 03:43:32.874]  I'm sorry.
[03:43:32.894 --> 03:43:35.958]  Get Natalie and Max's name and number, your first name.
[03:43:36.598 --> 03:43:37.739]  I'll take calls again tomorrow.
[03:43:38.160 --> 03:43:39.621]  Don't let me forget we take calls tomorrow.
[03:43:40.262 --> 03:43:43.384]  Don't let me forget to take calls, and don't let me forget to call Natalie and Max back if they want.
[03:43:43.644 --> 03:43:44.484]  We'll put them at the front of the line.
[03:43:44.684 --> 03:43:45.845]  If not, love you, appreciate you.
[03:43:46.125 --> 03:43:46.845]  All right, we're out of time.
[03:43:47.746 --> 03:43:49.267]  We are doing God's work here, okay?
[03:43:49.847 --> 03:43:50.687]  I will never back down.
[03:43:50.707 --> 03:43:51.528]  I will never sell out.
[03:43:51.588 --> 03:43:52.868]  It's impossible, but I could give out.
[03:43:53.469 --> 03:43:54.449]  I need your word of mouth.
[03:43:54.649 --> 03:43:55.410]  I need your prayer.
[03:43:55.730 --> 03:43:56.390]  I need your support.
[03:43:56.410 --> 03:43:57.391]  Plus, we have great products you need.
[03:43:57.991 --> 03:43:58.991]  Nitric Boost, all of it.
[03:43:59.191 --> 03:44:01.553]  InfoWarsStore.com, the InfoWars MD line.
[03:44:02.033 --> 03:44:04.654]  All the great gummies, you know, all the great CBD.
[03:44:04.714 --> 03:44:05.855]  It's the best, lowest prices.
[03:44:06.315 --> 03:44:07.536]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:08.596 --> 03:44:12.818]  And my dad's company, who's a huge sponsor, and if they shut this down, it'll be a key sponsor at the new operation.
[03:44:12.878 --> 03:44:18.422]  You need to go to drjonesnaturals.com and get great products there, like next-level financial energy, all the nano-silver products, and more.
[03:44:18.722 --> 03:44:19.762]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:44:20.022 --> 03:44:21.843]  All right, great job to the crew putting up with me today.
[03:44:22.364 --> 03:44:23.504]  Everybody else, we love you.
[03:44:23.925 --> 03:44:24.865]  We appreciate you.
[03:44:25.265 --> 03:44:26.526]  Owen Schroer takes over now.
[03:44:26.546 --> 03:44:28.087]  If it's on your local station, support them.
[03:44:28.407 --> 03:44:31.769]  You can find Owen at infowars.com forward slash show and man.video.
[03:44:31.949 --> 03:44:32.830]  All right, and then 8 a.m.
[03:44:32.850 --> 03:44:36.334]  tomorrow, Harrison Smith, the American Journal, knocks out of the park as well.
[03:44:36.695 --> 03:44:41.920]  And then, Lord willing, I will return with Dr. a bunch of experts.
[03:44:43.163 --> 03:44:45.864]  Dr. David Martin and others, tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:44:46.024 --> 03:44:46.564]  Central.
[03:44:47.204 --> 03:44:50.125]  I was literally digging around for the two or three satellite phones I had.
[03:44:50.165 --> 03:44:51.125]  I'd given one to family.
[03:44:51.586 --> 03:44:53.426]  I was making sure they were charged, getting them ready.
[03:44:53.646 --> 03:44:56.147]  I have an antenna so I can be inside and use it for outside.
[03:44:56.687 --> 03:45:04.670]  I'm literally checking all my gear, getting everything ready, because I've been so offensively fighting the globalists that I basically had all my defensive in disarray.
[03:45:04.690 --> 03:45:11.972]  And so for me, Alex Jones, 74 days out from the election, and that 76 days of hell once he's president-elect,
[03:45:12.672 --> 03:45:18.097]  I'm now spending 10, 15, 20 percent of my time getting ready and that should show people the urgency in my mind.
[03:45:18.157 --> 03:45:20.699]  So the Satellite Phone Company is a great sponsor.
[03:45:20.719 --> 03:45:23.862]  Let's talk about some of the basics of what people need.
[03:45:24.683 --> 03:45:28.126]  There's some amazing new products they've got that you think are awesome.
[03:45:28.426 --> 03:45:32.630]  They've got the best satellite phones at the best prices with the best deals you're going to find.
[03:45:32.690 --> 03:45:33.431]  The good news is
[03:45:33.991 --> 03:45:36.092]  They're not a sponsor a lot of the time because they're sold out.
[03:45:36.252 --> 03:45:37.913]  They supply law enforcement, the military.
[03:45:37.933 --> 03:45:39.893]  I mean, they are the biggest company in the United States.
[03:45:39.913 --> 03:45:41.674]  You get the best deal because they buy the most.
[03:45:42.094 --> 03:45:44.475]  You see them sponsoring, you know, all the other big shows as well.
[03:45:44.495 --> 03:45:46.276]  You need to go to InfoWarsPhone.com.
[03:45:46.296 --> 03:45:47.376]  That way we get some of the support.
[03:45:47.796 --> 03:45:48.817]  InfoWarsPhone.com.
[03:45:48.857 --> 03:45:55.359]  Tell us about solar panels, solar charging systems, sat phones, and this other really cool secure encrypted phone.
[03:45:55.379 --> 03:45:56.420]  Tell us about these products.
[03:45:57.079 --> 03:46:00.544]  Well, the thing about it, you have to just look at what's happening.
[03:46:00.745 --> 03:46:06.374]  When they have 50 plus senators on the left getting sat phones in case there's a crisis, you shouldn't worry about it.
[03:46:06.814 --> 03:46:09.258]  If I'm going to keep people from uprising, I'm going to kill comms.
[03:46:09.318 --> 03:46:10.079]  It's the first thing you do.
[03:46:10.119 --> 03:46:11.281]  That's how you control chaos.
[03:46:11.662 --> 03:46:11.882]  I mean,
[03:46:12.483 --> 03:46:12.983]  We're good to go.
[03:46:29.253 --> 03:46:30.194]  And then we do a drill.
[03:46:30.495 --> 03:46:31.956]  Every quarter we do a drill.
[03:46:32.036 --> 03:46:32.216]  Why?
[03:46:32.256 --> 03:46:35.119]  Because it allows me to remind myself to charge the phone.
[03:46:35.479 --> 03:46:38.542]  But this is part of my emergency response team, the security team.
[03:46:38.803 --> 03:46:43.147]  The guys are bringing the food and shelter in, the fuel, the power, everything, right?
[03:46:43.707 --> 03:46:46.710]  The other thing that I do is I also have sat radio.
[03:46:46.750 --> 03:46:47.151]  So for me,
[03:46:47.911 --> 03:46:54.876]  And my team, especially when we're on the border or areas where it's off-grid, I'm making sure that I have my sat radios, right?
[03:46:56.317 --> 03:47:00.399]  Another great tool that I have is, of course, like, you know, simple, right?
[03:47:00.420 --> 03:47:05.783]  You got your power, your power bank, and then you have your actual charging, your solar charging panels, right?
[03:47:06.083 --> 03:47:11.827]  For areas that you're out in the desert, because what good is it if you have all your battery backups, but they're all dead, you know?
[03:47:14.139 --> 03:47:17.160]  Then I also carry a Baystate, which is an SOS.
[03:47:17.200 --> 03:47:20.381]  You can drop it, send text messages with a backup phone.
[03:47:21.461 --> 03:47:25.902]  That works extremely well just for grid down, quick messaging.
[03:47:26.522 --> 03:47:30.683]  The other part of it, the security part of it, is I put the security team on these garments.
[03:47:30.703 --> 03:47:34.404]  These garments are also really, really good assets to have.
[03:47:35.254 --> 03:47:41.158]  And just for example, with Rescue the Republic, right, that's going to be September 29th in D.C.
[03:47:41.798 --> 03:47:52.004]  You got RJ speaking, you got Tulsi Gavar speaking, and you have the other big man speaking and a bunch of other people that is all being announced as this stuff comes along.
[03:47:52.584 --> 03:47:58.808]  But all our security, the entire security team is using the Secure Phone.
[03:47:59.750 --> 03:48:06.596]  The secure phone is a video phone and it is secure messaging phone to phone.
[03:48:06.636 --> 03:48:11.020]  So if it ever were to get hacked, it scrubs all the messages from it.
[03:48:11.060 --> 03:48:12.941]  That phone completely shuts down.
[03:48:12.961 --> 03:48:14.202]  Everything clears off of it.
[03:48:14.823 --> 03:48:15.884]  It's water resistant.
[03:48:17.253 --> 03:48:19.393]  It prevents tracking, right?
[03:48:19.834 --> 03:48:24.575]  And this phone, to me, it's what NATO's using right now.
[03:48:25.115 --> 03:48:26.255]  So the commanders are using it.
[03:48:26.635 --> 03:48:28.335]  It's the very, very top of it.
[03:48:28.435 --> 03:48:38.718]  It's something that I feel is going to be key, not just in the public sector, but in the private sector when it comes to family members.
[03:48:39.338 --> 03:48:44.619]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
