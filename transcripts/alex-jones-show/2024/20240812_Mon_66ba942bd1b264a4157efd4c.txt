[00:00:16.491 --> 00:00:17.611]  It's Monday, August 12, 2024.
[00:00:18.072 --> 00:00:25.955]  President Trump has returned to X. Powerful new ads will be interviewed by Elon Musk tonight at 7 o'clock central.
[00:00:25.975 --> 00:00:27.495]  We'll be covering it live here.
[00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:29.216]  But first, strap yourselves in.
[00:00:30.176 --> 00:00:30.917]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.277 --> 00:00:32.918]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:39.960]  160 days to the inauguration.
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.401]  That's the real date we've got to watch.
[00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:48.547]  84 days, 12 hours, 59 minutes to the election.
[00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:58.473]  President Trump, and I've been begging him to do this, has returned to X. That doesn't hurt true social, it helps it.
[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:20.283]  I'm about to be here for the next four hours.
[00:01:20.303 --> 00:01:24.064]  Naomi Wolf is coming up and so much more today.
[00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:25.785]  Wow.
[00:01:26.505 --> 00:01:26.725]  All right.
[00:01:26.845 --> 00:01:27.886]  Big controversy.
[00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:34.128]  Are they using AI at these Kamala Harris events?
[00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:36.489]  Now, this is such a big subject.
[00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:38.810]  To cover it properly would take two hours.
[00:01:40.797 --> 00:01:41.920]  But the answer is no.
[00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:44.305]  In general.
[00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:48.135]  But they are using AI to manipulate the images.
[00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:51.216]  These are some big crowds, but they're making them look three, four times bigger.
[00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:53.497]  So the answer is yes, it's both.
[00:01:53.578 --> 00:01:56.419]  And they're trying to conflate the issue.
[00:01:56.699 --> 00:02:01.022]  They're definitely photoshopping images and using AI to do that.
[00:02:01.102 --> 00:02:10.707]  But what you're seeing is the moveon.org Soros Women's March groups that they've got in big cities, and it's almost all middle-aged or older white women.
[00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:13.643]  And they're the secret weapon of the globalists.
[00:02:13.683 --> 00:02:17.964]  Now that said, they're doing a lot of camera angles, a lot of other things to make them look even bigger.
[00:02:18.324 --> 00:02:22.565]  They have photoshopped some shots of her in Michigan with Air Force One.
[00:02:23.926 --> 00:02:26.046]  So definitely, they are manipulating.
[00:02:26.126 --> 00:02:27.926]  But really, this is astroturf.
[00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:29.887]  They're busting these women in, they're buying them lunch.
[00:02:30.387 --> 00:02:33.348]  But they've got idiot voters, so you shouldn't be overconfident.
[00:02:33.848 --> 00:02:34.088]  All right?
[00:02:34.288 --> 00:02:35.128]  And neither is Trump.
[00:02:35.668 --> 00:02:38.569]  So it's good that people are waking up, that we're facing a real enemy here.
[00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:40.089]  But first, here's Trump's new ad.
[00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:44.874]  We can now project the winner of the presidential race.
[00:02:44.994 --> 00:02:47.197]  Donald Trump wins the presidency.
[00:02:47.337 --> 00:02:52.444]  What started off as unlikely, impossible is now reality.
[00:02:54.867 --> 00:02:58.773]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body.
[00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:02.870]  And I will never, ever let you down.
[00:03:29.448 --> 00:03:30.028]  It's been years.
[00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:30.969]  They hated him.
[00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.150]  They targeted him.
[00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.210]  They hunted him.
[00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.753]  This is the epitome of the abuse of the prosecutorial power to preempt political decisions.
[00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:42.135]  I never thought anything like this could happen in America.
[00:03:42.836 --> 00:03:49.480]  The only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.924]  The more that a broken system tells you that you're wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead.
[00:03:57.524 --> 00:04:01.949]  They want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom.
[00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:08.555]  They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you.
[00:04:11.158 --> 00:04:17.785]  They're not coming after me, they're coming after you and I just happen to be standing in their way and I will never be moving.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.883]  On November 5th, 2024, justice will be done.
[00:04:23.103 --> 00:04:29.067]  We will take back our country and we will make America great again.
[00:04:30.868 --> 00:04:35.531]  America will always rise to every challenge and overcome every danger.
[00:04:36.232 --> 00:04:40.155]  Donald Trump seems to always get stronger when challenged.
[00:04:40.555 --> 00:04:42.856]  These types of things, I think, give him strength.
[00:04:44.337 --> 00:04:47.920]  When I'm re-elected, I will totally obliterate the deep state.
[00:04:51.682 --> 00:05:04.224]  As long as we have pride in our beliefs, courage in our convictions, and faith in our God, then we will not fail.
[00:05:07.505 --> 00:05:08.045]  Powerful.
[00:05:08.245 --> 00:05:08.705]  Stay with us.
[00:05:08.745 --> 00:05:09.885]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[00:05:10.705 --> 00:05:11.085]  All right.
[00:05:12.106 --> 00:05:14.006]  I am loaded for bear.
[00:05:17.327 --> 00:05:19.167]  Let me tell you what's coming up today.
[00:05:20.632 --> 00:05:23.753]  Big transmission lined up for you in the war room.
[00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:25.874]  Gonna knock it out of the park.
[00:05:25.914 --> 00:05:29.616]  Owen's always done a great job eight years there, but he's really been hitting on all cylinders.
[00:05:30.556 --> 00:05:39.300]  And then, live coverage tonight of the Trump-Big Elon Musk interview.
[00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:46.183]  Trump has returned to X today, which is a good move.
[00:05:46.503 --> 00:05:48.944]  All it's gonna do is help True Social and help the country and the world.
[00:05:50.572 --> 00:05:53.633]  It's a little late, but okay with 80-something days of the election.
[00:05:55.634 --> 00:05:58.755]  Now he's in touch with those hundreds of millions more people, conservatively.
[00:06:00.536 --> 00:06:01.456]  Very exciting there.
[00:06:02.937 --> 00:06:04.237]  Let me tell you what else is coming up.
[00:06:06.758 --> 00:06:09.619]  They're doing the exact same playbook they did in 2016 and 2020 and 2022 in the off-year election.
[00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:09.979]  The deep state.
[00:06:15.598 --> 00:06:28.984]  Is saying all the polls show Kamala's gonna win by a landslide, Hillary's gonna win by a landslide, and that Trump doesn't really think he is gonna win, he wants to lose, and he's challenging fraud because he wants to make it look like it was stolen.
[00:06:29.504 --> 00:06:32.465]  No, he needs to stop, at least mitigate the fraud, or they will steal it.
[00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:40.249]  And so I thought we'd have some articles written, which the crew did over the weekend, Jamie White and others.
[00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:42.991]  Just documenting.
[00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:44.011]  Remember the headlines?
[00:06:44.332 --> 00:06:46.013]  Hillary will win by 90%.
[00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:47.634]  Hillary will win by 99%.
[00:06:48.254 --> 00:06:50.856]  99% chance she'll win.
[00:06:50.876 --> 00:06:52.257]  98% chance she'll win.
[00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:56.280]  Hillary 20 points ahead.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.601]  Hillary 15 points ahead.
[00:06:58.662 --> 00:07:02.064]  They're now running the exact same headline crap again.
[00:07:03.185 --> 00:07:04.086]  Thinking you're stupid.
[00:07:05.694 --> 00:07:07.655]  So we have a big article on Infowars.com.
[00:07:07.675 --> 00:07:08.455]  Don't be fooled.
[00:07:09.115 --> 00:07:13.097]  Pollsters who predicted 2016 Hillary landslide now say Kamala beating Trump.
[00:07:16.418 --> 00:07:17.218]  And it continues.
[00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:19.039]  I pulled up some of the original articles.
[00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:23.081]  Survey finds Hillary Clinton has more than 99% chance of winning.
[00:07:23.101 --> 00:07:23.961]  Remember the Washington Post?
[00:07:24.421 --> 00:07:25.622]  Election over Donald Trump.
[00:07:27.622 --> 00:07:29.143]  Clinton has 90% chance of winning.
[00:07:29.243 --> 00:07:29.643]  Reuters.
[00:07:29.983 --> 00:07:30.964]  IPSOS.
[00:07:31.304 --> 00:07:32.004]  State of the Union.
[00:07:32.024 --> 00:07:34.185]  State of the Nation.
[00:07:36.312 --> 00:07:40.815]  Our pollsters models give Hillary Clinton a 98.1 chance of winning the presidency.
[00:07:40.875 --> 00:07:41.356]  HuffPo.
[00:07:43.617 --> 00:07:48.480]  An examination 2016 electorate based on validated voters.
[00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:54.224]  So, they paid these pollsters to put these lies out.
[00:07:54.805 --> 00:07:59.728]  They thought they could steal it, but his landslide was so big they ran out of dead people and folks had to move out of district.
[00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:03.491]  That is a huge area we'll be getting more into.
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.461]  This one is just ultra-massive.
[00:08:07.481 --> 00:08:08.381]  I mean, we knew this.
[00:08:08.702 --> 00:08:09.722]  You'll say, well, we knew this.
[00:08:09.762 --> 00:08:10.242]  You knew this.
[00:08:10.322 --> 00:08:10.763]  I knew this.
[00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:12.243]  But it's admitted?
[00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:13.464]  Why would they do this?
[00:08:14.424 --> 00:08:23.589]  They've now had a bunch of Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi, come out and say, well, that letter probably wasn't even real, that Biden resigned.
[00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:25.950]  And they just put that out and embarrassed him into quitting.
[00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.711]  And yeah, I pressured him to go.
[00:08:29.692 --> 00:08:32.253]  Biden has come out and said that in an interview.
[00:08:32.333 --> 00:08:33.153]  We have that clip.
[00:08:33.434 --> 00:08:34.154]  These are all on video.
[00:08:37.871 --> 00:08:45.577]  And then you've got Biden and Raskin running around saying it will not be peaceful if Trump wins.
[00:08:47.538 --> 00:08:50.541]  This is admissions of a coup.
[00:08:53.723 --> 00:08:54.884]  Simply astounding.
[00:08:56.545 --> 00:09:02.049]  Absolutely astounding that they do all this.
[00:09:02.089 --> 00:09:03.610]  She doesn't get one vote in the primary.
[00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:05.712]  Ronald McDonald got as many votes as she did.
[00:09:07.659 --> 00:09:12.180]  They then remove the puppet they already stole the election to put in, but at least they pretended like there was an election there.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.100]  They try to outlaw questioning all the fraud that's now all confirmed.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.241]  It's even worse than what Trump said and I said.
[00:09:18.281 --> 00:09:20.941]  And then they turn around and select and install her.
[00:09:21.702 --> 00:09:22.902]  Nobody voted for her.
[00:09:22.982 --> 00:09:25.142]  Nobody voted for any of this crap.
[00:09:26.002 --> 00:09:31.443]  And then why does Pelosi come out and admit it, and why does Biden do it?
[00:09:32.624 --> 00:09:34.424]  They're just completely normalizing it.
[00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:37.499]  And they know it's gonna come out, so they're getting ahead of it.
[00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.940]  These people really know how to crap on you and rub it in.
[00:09:42.441 --> 00:09:44.081]  So, we've got that stacked.
[00:09:45.021 --> 00:09:45.822]  I'll be getting more into.
[00:09:46.962 --> 00:09:48.183]  And the video clips themselves.
[00:09:50.563 --> 00:09:55.045]  Then, Tim Walz is so bad, he's way worse than I thought.
[00:09:55.085 --> 00:09:56.686]  I thought I'd done my homework on this guy.
[00:09:57.186 --> 00:10:02.928]  We have dozens of Stolen Valor video, where he now officially says he was in combat in Afghanistan.
[00:10:05.325 --> 00:10:06.506]  Just incredible.
[00:10:06.586 --> 00:10:15.693]  In any other world, he would have to resign immediately from his selection as the VP by the selected operative Kamala Harris.
[00:10:15.753 --> 00:10:16.894]  Just mind-blowing.
[00:10:16.934 --> 00:10:21.777]  Also, Tim Walz left eight babies who survived botched abortions to die, government data shows.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.583]  And there's all this other wild corruption of him basically being a Chinese Communist spy.
[00:10:30.618 --> 00:10:36.703]  And obsessed with Mao Zedong and collecting little red books and spending months and months and months and months and months and months.
[00:10:36.743 --> 00:10:38.244]  I mean, dozens of trips to China.
[00:10:40.366 --> 00:10:42.107]  Chinese communist spy written all over him.
[00:10:43.248 --> 00:10:46.911]  And now Senator Cotton is saying he basically is a Chai Com agent.
[00:10:47.891 --> 00:10:49.813]  Senator Cotton, China cultivated Tim Walz.
[00:10:50.473 --> 00:10:51.354]  Yeah, this guy is.
[00:10:52.995 --> 00:10:54.216]  And he supports communism.
[00:10:55.637 --> 00:10:56.438]  Can't make that up.
[00:11:01.067 --> 00:11:01.807]  This is a big one.
[00:11:02.248 --> 00:11:04.329]  This is something people really ought to educate themselves on.
[00:11:04.349 --> 00:11:16.134]  I mean, I know this audience is educated, but you're like the missionaries, or you're like the sales force that promotes freedom, or you're like the special forces operatives that go behind enemy lines and engage in force multiplication.
[00:11:16.254 --> 00:11:18.075]  Use whatever analogy you want.
[00:11:22.317 --> 00:11:29.541]  But I remembered this, and when I saw this last night, I was like, why didn't I point that out?
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.261]  Because there's just too many lies to even keep track of.
[00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:35.342]  But this is a whopper.
[00:11:36.182 --> 00:11:56.574]  And I remember at the time when she was the senator, she co-authored the bill, her name's on the bill, to hire 86,000 IRS agents to target pizza delivery people and maids at Airbnbs and waiters and waitresses and doormen
[00:11:59.423 --> 00:12:08.645]  And people in the service industry, remember Biden three and a half years ago, they passed a law to hire 86,000 IRS agents.
[00:12:10.446 --> 00:12:19.248]  And it was written to, and you've seen the crackdown, to target people who are getting a little, you know, $10 tip on Vimeo that they didn't pay taxes on.
[00:12:21.059 --> 00:12:28.641]  In the law, which is unconstitutional, it's also come out that the IRS is using AI to scan everybody's bank accounts in live time.
[00:12:28.761 --> 00:12:41.044]  So, let's say you're a masseuse, you get a $50 tip, and you deposit that in your bank account along with the money you gotta pay for the massage, and now they hit you with an IRS audit.
[00:12:43.484 --> 00:12:45.344]  Oh, you didn't declare $3,000 this year!
[00:12:45.425 --> 00:12:47.165]  People can barely make it already!
[00:12:49.417 --> 00:12:50.117]  Good for them.
[00:12:51.038 --> 00:12:54.099]  Oh, but the government wants to give you free tuition and free everything.
[00:12:54.119 --> 00:12:55.359]  No, they want to make you dependent.
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.381]  So this is another just insane report.
[00:13:00.862 --> 00:13:01.342]  Busted.
[00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:09.225]  Biden and men impose a new tax scheme on tips before copycat Kamala stole Trump's tax on tips plan.
[00:13:09.265 --> 00:13:13.607]  So when she was in the Senate, and I'm getting this conflated, she passed laws
[00:13:15.387 --> 00:13:24.395]  Five years ago, increasing the size of the IRS, and then she increased it again, specifically targeting people once she was in the White House, and promoted it.
[00:13:24.415 --> 00:13:28.699]  So she's promising all these free goodies now, but she's been in power for almost four years.
[00:13:32.322 --> 00:13:33.423]  So you can't make this up.
[00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:35.805]  But she actually cheerleaded this.
[00:13:35.845 --> 00:13:39.008]  She's been the tax working-class people czar.
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.741]  Just like she's been the border, open the border czar.
[00:13:43.461 --> 00:13:45.681]  Destroy the border czar, the treason czar.
[00:13:49.022 --> 00:13:51.843]  And I've even got the newscast of them promoting it.
[00:13:52.483 --> 00:13:54.643]  Oh, we're going to raise hundreds of millions of dollars, you know.
[00:13:55.163 --> 00:13:57.704]  We're not going to let these low-level people, you know, hide money.
[00:14:00.485 --> 00:14:03.245]  And then, of course, I forgot to send this to the crew, but you guys can find it fast.
[00:14:03.345 --> 00:14:05.606]  I think I did actually send it, but I sent you hundreds of things.
[00:14:05.666 --> 00:14:06.326]  I didn't get all of them.
[00:14:07.658 --> 00:14:27.004]  I posted on, I think yesterday, a side-by-side of Trump saying, you know, a waitress had an idea for me, I think it's a great idea, no taxes on tips for any service worker, whether it's a maid, a masseuse, an auto mechanic, anybody, a waitress.
[00:14:28.024 --> 00:14:35.126]  And he said that months ago in June, and then here she is in Detroit saying the exact same thing, no taxes on tips.
[00:14:37.301 --> 00:14:38.762]  Now, here's the difference.
[00:14:38.782 --> 00:14:43.346]  See, that's how my brain works.
[00:14:43.606 --> 00:14:45.267]  I go back to the beginning and then go to the end.
[00:14:45.507 --> 00:14:48.189]  I should have said, hey, Cabal has been caught in a giant new line.
[00:14:50.651 --> 00:14:55.035]  She just came out and said she's going to get rid of taxes on service workers' tips.
[00:14:56.291 --> 00:15:01.114]  But she's actually been quarterbacking it in the Senate and in the White House for at least six, seven years.
[00:15:01.514 --> 00:15:03.796]  That's really the big takeaway.
[00:15:04.116 --> 00:15:05.457]  And then I drill through the evidence of it.
[00:15:05.477 --> 00:15:07.759]  Instead, I start going, look, she's the one with the taxes on tips.
[00:15:07.779 --> 00:15:14.523]  Instead of pointing out the elephant in the room that... Do you think if she actually gets in, she's gonna do that?
[00:15:15.824 --> 00:15:20.387]  Now, one thing you know about Trump is if he says something, he's gonna do it or try to do it.
[00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:21.848]  Or die trying.
[00:15:23.868 --> 00:15:49.657]  So I'm gonna ask everybody, is the quarterback of raping blue-collar workers, service workers, hard-working people, it's one of the best blue-collar jobs out there though, you make good money, is the quarterback of raping you, who just ripped off Trump's big initiative, is she actually gonna follow through if she steals the election?
[00:15:49.697 --> 00:15:51.178]  The answer is hell no.
[00:15:55.057 --> 00:15:56.357]  Alright, crew found the club, here it is.
[00:15:57.238 --> 00:16:02.120]  When I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips.
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.180]  People making tips.
[00:16:06.201 --> 00:16:11.403]  Eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers.
[00:16:13.584 --> 00:16:14.284]  Oh my God.
[00:16:15.164 --> 00:16:16.505]  Just please, God help me.
[00:16:17.505 --> 00:16:19.366]  You know, I want to save the country and the world.
[00:16:19.406 --> 00:16:20.186]  I want to get Trump in.
[00:16:21.664 --> 00:16:24.065]  But also, I don't want to look at her for four years.
[00:16:24.405 --> 00:16:24.625]  Oh, my.
[00:16:24.865 --> 00:16:28.466]  I mean, just give me a... I've never seen a more revolting laugh.
[00:16:29.146 --> 00:16:30.487]  I hate her fake swagger.
[00:16:30.547 --> 00:16:32.067]  I didn't even play the clips last week.
[00:16:33.147 --> 00:16:34.268]  She's gone all over the country.
[00:16:35.268 --> 00:16:38.169]  And when she was in... In fact, find them again.
[00:16:38.209 --> 00:16:41.130]  I've got to play them.
[00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:41.750]  It's everywhere.
[00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:48.792]  Just type in... Kamala puts on new black accent in Detroit.
[00:16:49.721 --> 00:16:50.262]  There's another one.
[00:16:50.322 --> 00:16:53.145]  Kamala puts on black southern accent in Atlanta.
[00:16:53.585 --> 00:17:01.834]  And Atlanta... The, the... Again, she just makes these up what she thinks a black person in the South sounds like, and it sounds like something from...
[00:17:03.103 --> 00:17:04.483]  Like a racist old movie or something.
[00:17:04.503 --> 00:17:06.024]  Like, how you doing now?
[00:17:06.464 --> 00:17:07.384]  Hey, hey, hey.
[00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:08.825]  It's like a Fat Albert voice.
[00:17:09.645 --> 00:17:12.966]  And then she goes to Detroit and I can't even do the voice.
[00:17:13.606 --> 00:17:16.266]  But it's like, hey, what's going on, little buddy?
[00:17:16.787 --> 00:17:17.827]  All right, what's going on?
[00:17:17.887 --> 00:17:21.728]  I mean, it's again, I want to talk to folks in Georgia.
[00:17:22.955 --> 00:17:25.516]  And I get up to the podium and I go, how you doing out there?
[00:17:25.556 --> 00:17:27.756]  Would you like a possum for your dinner now?
[00:17:28.496 --> 00:17:30.737]  I mean, it is so bizarre.
[00:17:30.797 --> 00:17:34.718]  Or if I want to speak to a group of, say, you know, Hispanic organization.
[00:17:35.198 --> 00:17:35.958]  Love to, they invite me.
[00:17:36.758 --> 00:17:38.458]  And I go, hello everyone!
[00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:40.059]  Would you like a taco?
[00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:46.180]  I mean, it is, it is, it's like what type of weirdo acts like this?
[00:17:47.501 --> 00:17:49.021]  People that are fake as hell, that's it.
[00:17:50.094 --> 00:17:56.380]  She got the law passed and then expanded it with Biden to rape people for their tips.
[00:17:59.742 --> 00:18:03.226]  Now she steals Trump's idea that was a waitress's idea in Vegas.
[00:18:04.366 --> 00:18:05.067]  And Trump loves it.
[00:18:05.087 --> 00:18:06.248]  Trump actually got the idea from a waitress.
[00:18:06.749 --> 00:18:08.310]  Hey, why don't you get rid of those taxes on us?
[00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:09.931]  He goes, that's a damn good idea.
[00:18:09.951 --> 00:18:13.835]  Because that's where Trump gets his ideas, is with the people, always has.
[00:18:15.233 --> 00:18:21.455]  Since he was like three and four years old on construction sites with his dad and his dad would say, all right, I'm leaving you for six hours with these construction workers.
[00:18:23.815 --> 00:18:26.436]  That's why Trump's always had his dad was self-made.
[00:18:26.496 --> 00:18:29.597]  He wasn't rich until he got rich and his dad didn't want to wimp.
[00:18:29.957 --> 00:18:34.899]  So all his kids, he just threw them out there, you know, on the weekends and in the summer.
[00:18:36.159 --> 00:18:37.899]  Trump talks about people that knew Trump talk about.
[00:18:37.939 --> 00:18:38.560]  I mean, that's good.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.640]  That's kind of stuff my family did.
[00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:44.633]  They weren't building giant buildings or anything, but they had businesses and operations and ranches.
[00:18:44.673 --> 00:18:47.274]  And then he was like, hey, you're going to grandma's for two months.
[00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:49.795]  You're not going to sit around and play video games, buddy boy.
[00:18:50.475 --> 00:18:53.196]  I was like 11, 12, 13 years old, but side issue.
[00:18:54.977 --> 00:18:57.058]  You've got Chuckie Schumer can't even cook a hamburger.
[00:18:59.718 --> 00:19:03.321]  The leftists think when you fire a gun, the entire cartridge goes down the barrel.
[00:19:03.741 --> 00:19:04.982]  They're like space aliens.
[00:19:05.462 --> 00:19:10.787]  And so, to her, whatever group she's there, she goes, how can I placate them?
[00:19:11.007 --> 00:19:11.967]  Let me give you a newsflash.
[00:19:11.987 --> 00:19:17.532]  I don't want to give the Democrats advice, but people don't, on average, like someone
[00:19:19.107 --> 00:19:19.747]  We're good to go.
[00:19:41.717 --> 00:19:43.258]  I can't even do a Cuban accent.
[00:19:43.298 --> 00:19:48.642]  Just imagine if I did a Cuban accent to somebody at a Cuban restaurant.
[00:19:48.662 --> 00:19:50.064]  They'd be like, dude, is something wrong with you?
[00:19:53.246 --> 00:19:54.307]  You must stop now.
[00:19:54.987 --> 00:19:57.589]  You didn't bring me the type of ham sandwich I wanted.
[00:19:59.311 --> 00:20:00.952]  Next time, you bring it to me right.
[00:20:01.772 --> 00:20:02.653]  I can't really do it.
[00:20:02.873 --> 00:20:04.955]  The point is, and she can't do it either.
[00:20:04.975 --> 00:20:06.896]  Look, I'm getting stuck on this.
[00:20:06.936 --> 00:20:07.537]  I need to move on.
[00:20:09.724 --> 00:20:12.266]  And you've got the clip of her in Detroit, and the clip of her in Atlanta.
[00:20:12.486 --> 00:20:12.846]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:13.066 --> 00:20:16.028]  Two completely different, made-up black accents.
[00:20:16.709 --> 00:20:17.089]  Here it is.
[00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:22.492]  And you all helped us win in 2020, and we're gonna do it again in 2024!
[00:20:22.673 --> 00:20:23.313]  Yes, we will.
[00:20:23.333 --> 00:20:30.478]  Yes, we will.
[00:20:30.538 --> 00:20:32.379]  So let's get r— Hold on.
[00:20:32.879 --> 00:20:33.420]  You know what?
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:34.060]  Here.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:34.700]  Hold on.
[00:20:35.001 --> 00:20:35.541]  Here's the thing.
[00:20:36.061 --> 00:20:37.342]  The courts are gonna handle that.
[00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:38.343]  We're gonna beat them in November.
[00:20:43.314 --> 00:20:43.414]  Okay.
[00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:44.976]  We'll beat him in November.
[00:20:44.996 --> 00:20:45.436]  We'll handle that.
[00:20:47.318 --> 00:20:48.959]  We gon' beat him in November.
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.722]  So, she just shows up in Detroit.
[00:20:54.023 --> 00:20:54.964]  And I've been to Detroit many times.
[00:20:55.004 --> 00:20:56.365]  Black folks don't talk like that.
[00:20:59.768 --> 00:21:00.488]  We gon' beat him.
[00:21:01.169 --> 00:21:02.029]  Yeah, we gon' beat him.
[00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:05.712]  And then when she's in Georgia, it's a weird black Southern accent.
[00:21:05.732 --> 00:21:07.334]  Okay, I'm done talking about it.
[00:21:09.281 --> 00:21:16.144]  The point is, busted Biden man imposes new tax scheme on tips before copycat Kamala stole Trump's no tax on tips plan.
[00:21:16.665 --> 00:21:22.368]  It's a great illustration of it, shows Trump to a black waitress with a sign saying no taxes on tips.
[00:21:22.968 --> 00:21:24.369]  Vote for me, I'll do that too.
[00:21:24.389 --> 00:21:25.629]  And she hands him a handwritten letter.
[00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.190]  The lady says back, bitch, you don't.
[00:21:30.732 --> 00:21:32.373]  You know you're the VP, right?
[00:21:33.353 --> 00:21:35.154]  Why didn't you do it now?
[00:21:36.475 --> 00:21:37.015]  Absolutely.
[00:21:38.905 --> 00:21:43.208]  Busted Biden and imposed new tax scheme on tips before copycat Kamala.
[00:21:44.949 --> 00:21:47.550]  Stole Trump's no tax on tips plan.
[00:21:50.552 --> 00:21:56.475]  VP Kamala Harris cast tie-breaking vote to let IRS track workers' tips so they can be taxed.
[00:21:57.896 --> 00:21:59.017]  I shouldn't laugh about it.
[00:21:59.657 --> 00:22:00.518]  It's so sick.
[00:22:01.818 --> 00:22:04.440]  I mean, it's just, it's too much.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.261]  It's just everything.
[00:22:08.112 --> 00:22:10.754]  She was one of the most famous prosecutors in U.S.
[00:22:10.774 --> 00:22:11.114]  history.
[00:22:11.454 --> 00:22:22.621]  I mean, I knew who she was when she was a prosecutor in San Francisco 25 years ago when I was on air because she was so famous for throwing black people in jail and throwing the key away for nonviolent offenses.
[00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:24.142]  She had a hard-on for them.
[00:22:25.242 --> 00:22:28.544]  And then when she was the Attorney General of the state, she was even worse.
[00:22:28.884 --> 00:22:30.285]  I mean, she's famous for going after black people.
[00:22:30.865 --> 00:22:31.446]  I mean, famous!
[00:22:33.752 --> 00:22:36.937]  And on a dime, oh, I love you.
[00:22:37.318 --> 00:22:39.180]  I'm going to let you out of jail.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.683]  That's how I talk to you.
[00:22:40.703 --> 00:22:42.365]  I mean, what the hell?
[00:22:43.768 --> 00:22:45.851]  Can you imagine this person being the president?
[00:22:46.732 --> 00:22:48.275]  I just don't know what to say at this point.
[00:22:54.161 --> 00:23:04.464]  All right, so I kind of halfway covered this, but I'm going to go back into some of these other areas with the coup against Biden, which even though we hate Biden, point is, you can debate whether they stole the election.
[00:23:04.504 --> 00:23:09.586]  Obviously they did, the evidence is overwhelming, but you can still hide under the rock and say it didn't happen and try to argue it.
[00:23:10.526 --> 00:23:15.027]  You can't argue that they removed Biden and the people they put in, nobody voted for.
[00:23:15.047 --> 00:23:19.569]  I mean, that's cut and dry a coup, 100%, no debate about it.
[00:23:20.725 --> 00:23:25.626]  And I've got the clips coming up of Biden admitting it, Pelosi admitting it, and their answer?
[00:23:25.966 --> 00:23:28.406]  We're just gonna not accept Trump winning.
[00:23:28.867 --> 00:23:39.149]  Well, of course, you think people that scale one election and remove the president, that they stuck in there, but they claim got votes, and they claim won, and then at least they've got some cover there, they have no cover here?
[00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:41.989]  I mean, how far do you think they'll go?
[00:23:43.249 --> 00:23:43.929]  Well, they tell you.
[00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:46.150]  We're not letting them get in office.
[00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:59.991]  So, you know, if I was if I was just a person into pure entertainment, I'd be sitting back with popcorn right now watching all this, but I'm not a guy that likes dog fighting and, you know, stuff like that.
[00:24:00.051 --> 00:24:02.674]  I just, you know, I don't like seeing two things just tear themselves up.
[00:24:04.156 --> 00:24:05.957]  Especially when I'm gonna get torn up.
[00:24:06.318 --> 00:24:07.178]  You're gonna get torn up.
[00:24:07.398 --> 00:24:09.460]  These people have already run this country in the ground.
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.903]  I'm not even sure Trump, with our full backing, can turn this son of a bitch around.
[00:24:13.943 --> 00:24:18.987]  It'll be better than under them, but I'm not thinking it's all gonna be peaches and cream when Trump gets in now.
[00:24:19.728 --> 00:24:21.289]  We are in deep crap.
[00:24:23.791 --> 00:24:24.651]  And then I've got this.
[00:24:24.671 --> 00:24:27.513]  And I've spent way too much time on this.
[00:24:27.573 --> 00:24:29.555]  I've spent... Let's not exaggerate.
[00:24:31.155 --> 00:24:44.000]  Probably six, seven hours since Friday, trying to get my mind around this, going back to source videos, and I know what happened, and I know what's going on, but then to present it would take hours.
[00:24:45.341 --> 00:24:51.483]  And then it just turns into a tar baby, and it's exactly what the CIA wants, and it's just, it's a disaster.
[00:24:53.044 --> 00:25:00.607]  That's why, if you want to know what's going on, go to a Kamala Waltz event for yourself, go to a Trump event for yourself, and post the video yourself.
[00:25:01.977 --> 00:25:04.820]  Wide panning shots of everything, and then we can compare to what they're doing.
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:13.448]  But yes, they are using Photoshop with AI, and they are manipulating things in post, videos, and photos.
[00:25:13.588 --> 00:25:26.401]  Now, that said, they're using camera tricks mainly, and they have activated the Soros network of women's groups who are very, very, very, very big.
[00:25:29.355 --> 00:25:33.698]  And they have big databases of women, mainly white women, old white women, they bus in.
[00:25:33.718 --> 00:25:36.100]  And so they are going to get votes.
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.301]  And some of these videos are real.
[00:25:37.341 --> 00:25:42.244]  Now, they will crop the videos or shoot to where it doesn't show that half the stadium is empty.
[00:25:42.904 --> 00:25:48.368]  They'll go back in later and add with the video editing with AI to make it look better.
[00:25:48.408 --> 00:25:49.209]  They are doing that.
[00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:50.089]  They are getting caught.
[00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:51.991]  These are videos from the Harris campaign.
[00:25:52.631 --> 00:25:54.692]  You see that, you know, where they land in Detroit?
[00:25:55.052 --> 00:25:55.752]  Or was it Dearborn?
[00:25:56.392 --> 00:25:57.853]  You see Air Force Two out there.
[00:25:57.873 --> 00:26:00.234]  It's really Air Force One now with the coup.
[00:26:01.334 --> 00:26:03.595]  And you see this big, long, giant mass of people.
[00:26:03.855 --> 00:26:05.136]  I went and found the raw videos.
[00:26:05.776 --> 00:26:11.218]  They put them all in about a 60-yard wide trail out the door.
[00:26:12.611 --> 00:26:19.234]  To make it look big and then they officially released photos that photoshopped even more people out past that.
[00:26:19.874 --> 00:26:28.798]  And that's why you blow up the airplane video or photos and you don't see any reflection of buildings or people right up against it because it's fake.
[00:26:29.638 --> 00:26:31.359]  They took multiple images and put them together.
[00:26:31.779 --> 00:26:32.679]  Yes, they're doing it.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:40.603]  But it's a tar baby because you just fall down a rabbit hole and but it is simply amazing.
[00:26:41.499 --> 00:26:44.920]  An InfoWars fan favorite is now back in stock after over a year of not being available.
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.903]  It is the Vitamin C and Zinc with Rosehips.

[00:27:15.803 --> 00:27:23.331]  It is a thousand milligrams of organic vitamin C with zinc to take it into the cells and rose hips.
[00:27:23.351 --> 00:27:24.492]  Can you believe that?
[00:27:24.512 --> 00:27:25.073]  Supercharged.
[00:27:25.674 --> 00:27:27.035]  This formula is amazing.

[00:28:00.916 --> 00:28:08.144]  Alex Jones here to respond to the firestorm controversy of Joe Rogan supposedly endorsing RFK Jr.
[00:28:08.484 --> 00:28:09.205]  over Donald Trump.
[00:28:09.656 --> 00:28:11.917]  The only one who's not doing that is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:28:12.217 --> 00:28:12.697]  You a fan?
[00:28:12.957 --> 00:28:13.897]  Yeah, I am a fan.
[00:28:14.297 --> 00:28:15.817]  Yeah, he's the only one that makes sense to me.
[00:28:15.857 --> 00:28:17.878]  He's the only one that, he doesn't attack people.
[00:28:18.458 --> 00:28:21.039]  He attacks actions and ideas.
[00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:25.220]  Now I'm not defending Joe right now because I've known him 25 plus years.
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:30.501]  I'm defending Joe because as populists, as conservatives, as nationalists, as
[00:28:31.221 --> 00:28:36.066]  Free market anti-communist, whatever you want to call folks that support Trump and support what's left of America.
[00:28:36.606 --> 00:28:42.231]  We can't be like the left when people disagree with us on basic things in a polite way.
[00:28:42.652 --> 00:28:46.615]  We can't try to de-platform them and scream and yell at them and call them scumbags and call them traitors.
[00:28:47.216 --> 00:28:48.477]  All it does is turn people off.
[00:28:49.648 --> 00:28:51.409]  Especially when you look at the case of Joe Rogan.
[00:28:51.789 --> 00:29:05.338]  Joe has come so far in the last five, six years, exposing the poison shots, exposing the open borders, exposing the WUF, Bill Gates, the New World Order, the transgender cult, basically everything.
[00:29:05.858 --> 00:29:10.481]  And I know for a fact it's been Joe that's really helped wake up Elon Musk and so many others.
[00:29:10.561 --> 00:29:14.043]  And Joe has had a nonpartisan show.
[00:29:14.703 --> 00:29:19.186]  And so he's been able to reach a lot of liberals and a lot of leftists and have woken them up.
[00:29:19.855 --> 00:29:21.778]  So the fact that he's known RFK Jr.
[00:29:21.798 --> 00:29:33.573]  for a while, the fact that he likes him, the fact that they go out to dinner, the fact that he said, I think of the three people running, he is the most reasonable and somebody that attacks issues instead of individuals.
[00:29:33.673 --> 00:29:35.596]  And look, I love Trump.
[00:29:36.443 --> 00:29:37.183]  And I do this too.
[00:29:37.683 --> 00:29:46.545]  But at the end of the day, it's not the best thing to do where Trump attacks people and makes fun of them, or when the corporate media lies about Trump, he then responds every time.
[00:29:47.065 --> 00:29:52.626]  Because in a way, that's how they keep you off balance, talking about them instead of talking about what we're going to do.
[00:29:52.706 --> 00:29:57.387]  You're aware of this recent Donald Trump speech where he talked about a bloodbath?
[00:29:57.747 --> 00:29:58.707]  Oh, God, yeah.
[00:29:58.767 --> 00:30:01.547]  What the actual phrase was.
[00:30:02.007 --> 00:30:05.108]  See if you can find that, Jamie, because it's actually important to highlight how
[00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:14.832]  Not just inaccurate, but it's just deceptive the media was in their depiction of what he said.
[00:30:15.632 --> 00:30:22.533]  Like President Trump coming up with the idea to have no tax on tips and on service employees.
[00:30:22.593 --> 00:30:23.073]  Great idea.
[00:30:23.093 --> 00:30:25.034]  Now Kamala is trying to co-opt that.
[00:30:25.094 --> 00:30:30.295]  Because when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips.
[00:30:30.355 --> 00:30:31.335]  People making tips.
[00:30:35.527 --> 00:30:39.350]  Eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers.
[00:30:41.352 --> 00:30:48.497]  Even though it was the Democratic Party under Biden that radically expanded the IRS, 86,000 new agents, to mainly target working class people.
[00:30:48.537 --> 00:30:51.560]  So Trump should be on issues like that, which he is.
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.001]  In fact, he's a lot better.
[00:30:53.581 --> 00:30:54.062]  And J.D.
[00:30:54.122 --> 00:30:56.463]  Vance has made the same point that R.F.K.
[00:30:56.503 --> 00:30:56.784]  Jr.
[00:30:56.824 --> 00:30:58.465]  is making and that Joe's making and others.
[00:30:59.266 --> 00:31:03.509]  At the end of the day, if we transcend partisanship, which I know is hard to do,
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:09.626]  We can really speak to people directly on the issues, and we can gain ground and save this country.
[00:31:10.126 --> 00:31:12.549]  Because the Republican Party's been horrible and corrupt for a long time.
[00:31:12.929 --> 00:31:21.978]  The Democratic Party has gone completely corrupt, but we have a beachhead of populism and nationalism and common sense in the Republican Party, and that's why the power structure tried to kill President Trump.
[00:31:22.319 --> 00:31:26.703]  You are interviewing me, Dana, because I respect the American people enough to sit down for interviews.
[00:31:26.763 --> 00:31:27.204]  I appreciate that.
[00:31:27.444 --> 00:31:29.565]  Kamala Harris has been the nominee for three weeks.
[00:31:29.605 --> 00:31:31.346]  She hasn't sat down for a real interview.
[00:31:31.366 --> 00:31:32.086]  Believe me, we are asking.
[00:31:32.406 --> 00:31:34.227]  You're not going to get a disagreement there.
[00:31:34.247 --> 00:31:37.489]  But the point is, Dana, you've got me for 15 minutes or however long you have me.
[00:31:37.829 --> 00:31:40.390]  We should be talking about public policies that matter.
[00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:41.991]  How are we going to lower inflation?
[00:31:42.271 --> 00:31:44.592]  How are we going to reduce the cost of food and housing?
[00:31:44.632 --> 00:31:46.273]  How are we going to close down that southern border?
[00:31:46.553 --> 00:31:47.993]  We've talked so little about that.
[00:31:48.273 --> 00:31:51.335]  We've talked a lot more about a sarcastic remark I made three years ago.
[00:31:51.635 --> 00:31:53.916]  I think we should talk about the issues that most Americans care about.
[00:31:54.156 --> 00:31:58.360]  So when I give this type of advice, I'm not lecturing anybody out there.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.303]  I'm just telling you what I think is the best thing to do.
[00:32:01.323 --> 00:32:12.053]  And I think Joe's very even-handed way that he covers issues from just a common-sense perspective is the most effective way to turn this country and the world around.
[00:32:12.493 --> 00:32:14.215]  Tucker Carlson does it as well.
[00:32:14.515 --> 00:32:15.957]  They're more of gentlemen.
[00:32:16.537 --> 00:32:18.159]  And Tucker likes RFK Jr.
[00:32:18.339 --> 00:32:18.659]  as well.
[00:32:18.759 --> 00:32:19.180]  So do I.
[00:32:20.385 --> 00:32:22.166]  I've got issues with RFK Jr.
[00:32:22.186 --> 00:32:28.790]  and the people around him, and I think he, at the end of the day, is still a leftist, so I'm not voting for him, but I think he's a man of integrity.
[00:32:29.671 --> 00:32:38.156]  He's very, very smart, and he's done irrevocable damage to the globalist agenda and done incredible good things for a free and open human society.
[00:32:38.817 --> 00:32:44.901]  So again, Joe came out with kind of a response to all this, explaining that he was not endorsing RFK Jr.
[00:32:45.865 --> 00:32:49.332]  I think that's what Joe is trying to say is he's trying to not do politics.
[00:32:50.013 --> 00:32:52.538]  He's trying to say whose policies he likes.
[00:32:53.019 --> 00:32:56.004]  So let Joe be incredibly influential.
[00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:58.170]  One of the most influential people on earth.
[00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:59.271]  He's in the top three or four.
[00:32:59.551 --> 00:33:01.451]  You know, Trump, Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, Dirk Carlson.
[00:33:01.871 --> 00:33:03.191]  And I'm kind of down in the tier below that.
[00:33:03.751 --> 00:33:12.793]  And let's realize how far Joe has come and the courage he had, you know, going back three and a half years ago and starting to call it the Poison Shots.
[00:33:13.153 --> 00:33:16.234]  Now, sure, I was doing it four plus years ago, but it doesn't matter.
[00:33:16.694 --> 00:33:18.935]  He definitely came to the game very, very early.
[00:33:18.955 --> 00:33:24.836]  And I could talk about the great things Joe does all day long, but the biggest one is he's a supporter of free speech.
[00:33:25.516 --> 00:33:29.478]  And he stands against censorship, and he's been fighting back against big tech censorship.
[00:33:29.758 --> 00:33:34.760]  He's been exposing the UK, trying to arrest people for no reason, and threatening American citizens.
[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.261]  I mean, Joe is hitting on all cylinders.
[00:33:38.061 --> 00:33:47.065]  So even if I didn't know Joe, even if we hadn't been friends going back to like 1999, I would still come out and defend him because, folks, he's hurting the globalists.
[00:33:47.085 --> 00:33:48.726]  Now, Musk has gone all the way.
[00:33:49.574 --> 00:33:50.494]  Fully endorsing Trump.
[00:33:51.015 --> 00:33:54.677]  And that's great, but we can't sit there and expect everybody else to do that.
[00:33:55.017 --> 00:34:00.860]  We just have to be thankful that they're really on Team Humanity and doing a great job waking people up.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:13.806]  So that's my breakdown, and I think we should really move on and focus on the really bad guys, the Democratic Party, the WEF, the UN, the big central banks, BlackRock, all of which Joe has guest on exposing.
[00:34:13.826 --> 00:34:15.247]  I mean, every week.
[00:34:16.161 --> 00:34:20.586]  Joe's exposing all the election fraud crap and the murder of Seth Rich.
[00:34:20.646 --> 00:34:22.108]  I mean, you name it, folks.
[00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:26.132]  He's just a smoother Alex Jones.
[00:34:26.233 --> 00:34:27.534]  He's smooth like Tucker Carlson.
[00:34:27.854 --> 00:34:29.356]  And so let him do that.
[00:34:30.177 --> 00:34:33.741]  Don't go after our allies just because they say something.
[00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:38.971]  That we don't exactly like perfectly and create a fake controversy out of it.
[00:34:39.291 --> 00:34:43.192]  We have cut and dry evil with Kamala Harris, who didn't get one vote in the primaries.
[00:34:43.773 --> 00:34:45.193]  She got the same amount of votes as Ronald McDonald.
[00:34:45.734 --> 00:34:46.654]  She's been selected.
[00:34:48.355 --> 00:34:51.916]  And that's something people should be pointing out, just like they stole the election from Bernie, the Democrats.
[00:34:52.396 --> 00:34:56.478]  We should be pointing that out to Democrats, not going after people like Joe Rogan, because I know Joe.
[00:34:57.158 --> 00:35:01.080]  And these type of things, people going after him, trying to push him more to the quote, establishment, right?
[00:35:02.369 --> 00:35:03.089]  It'll only backfire.
[00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:08.732]  Let's be thankful that Joe is doing such a great job, and let's support him, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:08.992 --> 00:35:14.974]  But regardless, you'll get the Alex Jones brand, both barrels, firing all your guns at once into space.
[00:35:15.474 --> 00:35:17.615]  I mean, you're gonna get it all, weekdays, 11 a.m.
[00:35:17.635 --> 00:35:21.177]  Central, at infowars.com forward slash show, and right here on X-Royal Alex Jones.
[00:35:21.697 --> 00:35:23.357]  Now, we've only got 80-something days of the election.
[00:35:23.838 --> 00:35:26.919]  The globalists are gonna try to steal it, they're trying to start World War III, all hell's breaking loose.
[00:35:27.439 --> 00:35:31.502]  Please join me and I'll break down the latest information with an amazing guest, callers and more.
[00:35:31.783 --> 00:35:33.044]  Thank you so much and God bless.
[00:35:34.325 --> 00:35:35.145]  What a guy.
[00:35:35.365 --> 00:35:36.987]  What a great guy.
[00:35:37.647 --> 00:35:40.709]  What an amazing American this man is, Joe Rogan.
[00:35:40.749 --> 00:35:43.271]  What a true patriot.
[00:35:43.972 --> 00:35:44.672]  Great man.
[00:35:44.913 --> 00:35:47.695]  I would never say anything negative about this man.
[00:35:54.742 --> 00:35:55.022]  All right.
[00:35:55.082 --> 00:35:56.563]  I shot that quick report this morning.
[00:35:56.603 --> 00:35:57.504]  Just aired it live here.
[00:35:57.524 --> 00:36:00.245]  Just posted on Relox Jones at X. That thing blew up.
[00:36:00.505 --> 00:36:02.767]  Tens of millions of views on the videos I saw attacking Joe.
[00:36:02.827 --> 00:36:06.149]  I mean, he does a podcast five days a week.
[00:36:06.169 --> 00:36:08.610]  He just tears the deep state a new one every day.
[00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:10.831]  And it's discrediting all their policies.
[00:36:12.813 --> 00:36:15.374]  And we shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.
[00:36:16.515 --> 00:36:17.295]  Is where I stand on that.
[00:36:17.415 --> 00:36:17.695]  Okay.
[00:36:19.456 --> 00:36:21.478]  Now shifting gears back into what's currently happening.
[00:36:22.718 --> 00:36:23.459]  Big developments.
[00:36:24.585 --> 00:36:25.845]  We're a whole bunch of Democrats.
[00:36:25.865 --> 00:36:27.666]  I want to play three clips because I've got like 10 of them.
[00:36:28.366 --> 00:36:44.412]  Pelosi, Biden, others are coming out admitting he was removed and that basically that letter that wasn't on official White House letterhead, you can put a copy of it up, put up Biden's resignation from the campaign letter, please.
[00:36:45.333 --> 00:36:47.313]  Remember, he didn't respond to it for over a week.
[00:36:48.374 --> 00:36:52.315]  So he's sick, out of his mind, medical emergency, flown back from Vegas.
[00:36:52.615 --> 00:36:53.356]  They probably drugged him.
[00:36:54.229 --> 00:36:55.329]  Or didn't give him the drugs he needed.
[00:36:55.649 --> 00:36:56.369]  It's all hopped up.
[00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:58.230]  He's in Delaware.
[00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:01.250]  And then all of a sudden this letter comes out of the White House.
[00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:02.551]  No one says where it even came from.
[00:37:02.831 --> 00:37:04.291]  Without White House letterhead, nothing.
[00:37:04.991 --> 00:37:09.092]  And the signature looked nothing like his regular signature that's public.
[00:37:09.872 --> 00:37:10.352]  Nothing like it.
[00:37:10.372 --> 00:37:11.092]  And I said, that's fake!
[00:37:12.472 --> 00:37:13.273]  It's not on letterhead.
[00:37:13.393 --> 00:37:14.633]  Everything the President does is on letterhead.
[00:37:14.693 --> 00:37:16.513]  And it's a fake signature.
[00:37:17.293 --> 00:37:17.833]  Now there it is.
[00:37:18.414 --> 00:37:19.934]  You can compare it to his regular real signature.
[00:37:19.974 --> 00:37:20.334]  It's everywhere.
[00:37:21.849 --> 00:37:24.471]  So a very bad forgery, a very... I mean, look at that.
[00:37:25.191 --> 00:37:28.853]  Looks like something, you know, a 10-year-old would do on a word processor.
[00:37:29.814 --> 00:37:33.696]  But they did that, again, threatening, now we've already embarrassed you.
[00:37:33.716 --> 00:37:37.919]  If you don't step down, we'll do the 22nd Amendment, which they have now admitted they did.
[00:37:37.999 --> 00:37:44.503]  So I know this is already known, we've already covered it for the last month, but they're now admitting it because
[00:37:45.748 --> 00:37:52.915]  This in itself is them hiding it in plain view just to normalize it so other investigators who are reporting on it don't get traction.
[00:37:52.955 --> 00:37:59.082]  Because if they just admit it and try to hide it in plain view and just act like it's normal and gaslight us, they think it'll go away.
[00:38:00.543 --> 00:38:00.923]  I don't know.
[00:38:22.677 --> 00:38:23.237]  Big deal.
[00:38:23.318 --> 00:38:26.740]  And you know, Trump trolls people sometimes, but not that often with facts.
[00:38:27.121 --> 00:38:36.508]  He'll make jokes and troll people, but he said a week ago on Truth Social, he said the word is Biden's going to try a comeback at the convention.
[00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:42.833]  And then you start seeing all these establishment Democrats attacking Kamala and Waltz, which they deserve.
[00:38:42.893 --> 00:38:45.035]  So this thing is far from over.
[00:38:45.075 --> 00:38:46.456]  I'm not predicting Biden will come back.
[00:38:46.536 --> 00:38:47.457]  I don't think he'll come back.
[00:38:48.318 --> 00:38:50.840]  But according to Trump's intel, they're going to try it and
[00:38:52.369 --> 00:38:58.894]  Here's Biden kind of going around on a new tour, kind of introducing the idea that he was removed in a coup.
[00:38:59.234 --> 00:39:03.678]  So that's the big takeaway here is it was a coup.
[00:39:04.658 --> 00:39:09.402]  A woman that got no votes in the primary is now flying around like she's the president.
[00:39:10.143 --> 00:39:13.245]  And they even admit in mainstream media that Biden's not in control.
[00:39:13.325 --> 00:39:14.226]  She's not in control.
[00:39:14.466 --> 00:39:15.607]  And they ask who is in control.
[00:39:17.148 --> 00:39:18.909]  This is so dysfunctional.
[00:39:20.831 --> 00:39:21.892]  So let's go ahead and play.
[00:39:24.955 --> 00:39:25.736]  So many of these clips.
[00:39:27.717 --> 00:39:30.259]  I want to play the Biden-Raskin clip first.
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.341]  This was all just last week.
[00:39:34.543 --> 00:39:42.149]  Saying he's not confident that there'll be a smooth transfer of power if Trump wins, and then Raskin talking about civil war conditions.
[00:39:42.169 --> 00:39:42.509]  Here it is.
[00:39:44.271 --> 00:39:45.272]  Are you confident?
[00:39:46.482 --> 00:39:50.603]  That there will be a peaceful transfer of power in January 2025.
[00:39:51.364 --> 00:39:54.525]  If Trump wins, no I'm not confident at all.
[00:39:54.985 --> 00:40:07.409]  So it's going to be up to us on January 6, 2025 to tell the rampaging Trump mobs that he's disqualified and then we need bodyguards for everybody in civil war condition.
[00:40:11.251 --> 00:40:12.291]  Are you confident
[00:40:13.476 --> 00:40:17.602]  That there will be a peaceful transfer of power in January 2025.
[00:40:18.363 --> 00:40:21.547]  If Trump wins, no I'm not confident at all.
[00:40:22.409 --> 00:40:24.391]  I mean if Trump loses, I'm not confident at all.
[00:40:26.234 --> 00:40:29.278]  I didn't accept the letter as anything but a letter.
[00:40:34.087 --> 00:40:34.687]  Let's begin with your decision.
[00:40:34.707 --> 00:40:39.648]  You're at your home, Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, late July, with your family, and you make this historic decision.
[00:41:04.326 --> 00:41:05.106]  Tell me the story.
[00:41:06.287 --> 00:41:11.030]  Look, the polls we had showed that it was a neck-and-neck race.
[00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:12.391]  We would have been down on the wire.
[00:41:13.591 --> 00:41:22.677]  But what happened was a number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races.
[00:41:23.857 --> 00:41:28.720]  And I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:32.983]  You'd be interviewing me about why did Nancy Pelosi say, why did someone...
[00:41:34.099 --> 00:41:37.146]  And I thought it would be a real distraction, number one.
[00:41:37.266 --> 00:41:42.778]  Number two, when I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition president.
[00:41:43.863 --> 00:41:47.885]  I can't even say how old I am, it's hard for me to get it out of my mouth.
[00:41:48.806 --> 00:41:52.828]  But things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen.
[00:41:53.808 --> 00:42:05.615]  And the combination was that I thought it was a critical issue for me still, it's not a joke, maintaining this democracy, but I thought it was important because although I
[00:42:06.195 --> 00:42:07.636]  It's a great honor being president.
[00:42:08.336 --> 00:42:16.221]  I think I have an obligation to the country to do what I, the most important thing to do, and that is we must, we must, we must defeat Trump.
[00:42:18.044 --> 00:42:20.226]  So the deep state stole the election 2020.
[00:42:20.546 --> 00:42:26.771]  They tried to completely steal it in 2022, were somewhat successful but still failed because the landslide was so big and now they're trying it again.
[00:42:27.471 --> 00:42:37.459]  They believe with their numbers Trump is 15-20 points ahead and they don't have enough dead people or folks in their databases to move out of district to override that with the famous Zuckerberg list that they've updated.
[00:42:39.577 --> 00:42:41.638]  And so they tried to kill Trump, and so they're gonna try it again.
[00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:52.646]  And people act like this is Netflix or a movie or another episode of TV where, oh, they just tried to kill him back on July 13th, a month ago, today, 30 days ago.
[00:42:55.088 --> 00:42:56.749]  And it's just kind of move on to the next thing.
[00:42:56.809 --> 00:42:58.150]  No, it's not move on to the next thing.
[00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:03.694]  These people have installed a coup of Kamala Harris.
[00:43:04.234 --> 00:43:05.135]  Again, you could debate
[00:43:06.294 --> 00:43:07.054]  Did Biden steal it?
[00:43:07.074 --> 00:43:10.636]  Of course he did, but at least it's not totally cut and dry.
[00:43:11.977 --> 00:43:28.705]  This is publicly cut and dry, and I think Trump should make a big deal, he already has, but a bigger deal about the fact that Elvis Presley got as many votes as Kamala Harris did in this election, in the primaries.
[00:43:30.746 --> 00:43:33.648]  Charlie Manson got as many votes as she did, which is zero.
[00:43:38.177 --> 00:43:42.619]  My cat, Mooshu, my daughter's cat, got more votes.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.100]  Or the same amount.
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:44.921]  Zero.
[00:43:44.941 --> 00:43:48.643]  I don't know, somebody might write the cat in.
[00:43:48.663 --> 00:43:49.583]  It's pretty famous now.
[00:43:50.624 --> 00:43:51.804]  When the feds try to take it.
[00:43:52.605 --> 00:43:54.706]  I'm not joking.
[00:43:54.746 --> 00:43:55.966]  I know, it's beyond bizarre.
[00:43:56.627 --> 00:44:06.552]  So, as I've said, the Hamburglar, Grimace, Ronald McDonald, Bugs Bunny,
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:15.564]  Santa Claus, the Lucky Charms, Leprechaun, got as many votes as Kamala Harris did to be where she is.
[00:44:15.624 --> 00:44:18.086]  Now, that's a coup cut and dry.
[00:44:18.626 --> 00:44:20.107]  These people are beyond a joke.
[00:44:20.127 --> 00:44:20.628]  They're dangerous.
[00:44:21.848 --> 00:44:26.751]  Now, I want to shift gears into other news in the 10 minutes we have left of the segment, but first let me just say this.
[00:44:26.791 --> 00:44:27.672]  We've got some good news.
[00:44:29.019 --> 00:44:33.162]  Without going into long inside baseball, I'm gonna do an update soon about the future of M4s.
[00:44:33.182 --> 00:44:36.084]  We'll be here at least another couple months now, probably longer.
[00:44:36.104 --> 00:44:36.725]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:44:37.025 --> 00:44:38.166]  God's smiling on us.
[00:44:38.186 --> 00:44:39.667]  Your prayers are having an effect.
[00:44:40.548 --> 00:44:45.792]  But the new court-appointed CRO is not like the last guy that tried to shut the company down.
[00:44:48.274 --> 00:44:51.937]  He has allowed us to reorder our best-selling products.
[00:44:52.837 --> 00:44:54.759]  And they came in last Friday.
[00:44:55.782 --> 00:44:58.723]  This could be, if they shut us down, the last run of Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:44:58.763 --> 00:44:59.303]  People love it.
[00:44:59.764 --> 00:45:01.024]  All the vitamins, all the minerals you need.
[00:45:01.124 --> 00:45:01.584]  Amazing.
[00:45:02.105 --> 00:45:02.885]  Absorbent to the body.
[00:45:03.065 --> 00:45:05.326]  Great, delicious, all-natural, organic fruit punch.
[00:45:06.286 --> 00:45:07.707]  Good for adults, children, everybody.
[00:45:08.287 --> 00:45:09.267]  And it supports broadcast.
[00:45:09.287 --> 00:45:10.108]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:45:10.188 --> 00:45:11.048]  Small shipment.
[00:45:12.689 --> 00:45:13.129]  Came in.
[00:45:13.889 --> 00:45:14.349]  We have it.
[00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:16.770]  A fan favorite.
[00:45:17.551 --> 00:45:18.691]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:45:18.891 --> 00:45:19.692]  95% cuminoid.
[00:45:19.712 --> 00:45:22.513]  So good for inflammation, your joints, your whole body, your immune system.
[00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:23.673]  Back in stock.
[00:45:23.933 --> 00:45:25.274]  And this has been sold out for a year.
[00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:41.821]  This is the Linus Pauling formula of Rosehip's 1,000 milligrams of organic plant-derived vitamin C with zinc to get into your cells for detoxification and everything else.
[00:45:42.281 --> 00:45:44.283]  This is something everybody should take every day.
[00:45:44.983 --> 00:45:49.727]  This is the classic Nobel Prize winning formula that Linus Pauling came out with.
[00:45:50.694 --> 00:45:53.155]  This is the standard, and I'll take point blank.
[00:45:53.475 --> 00:45:57.676]  There's probably 50 companies put out the same thing, because this has been around forever.
[00:45:57.816 --> 00:45:59.496]  It's just a staple for anybody that's got a brain.
[00:46:00.156 --> 00:46:02.076]  We've got our version that's excellent, high quality.
[00:46:03.057 --> 00:46:05.377]  Get it from us, ladies and gentlemen, for 40% off.
[00:46:05.417 --> 00:46:09.038]  You're not going to get the same formula at Whole Foods for any less than $29.95.
[00:46:10.418 --> 00:46:10.678]  Usually it's $40.
[00:46:11.779 --> 00:46:12.719]  We got it for $23.
[00:46:13.959 --> 00:46:15.019]  It supports the broadcast.
[00:46:15.459 --> 00:46:16.820]  So all three are back in stock.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.200]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:46:19.949 --> 00:46:23.611]  Our triple 8 2 5 3 3 1 3 9 and the big sale.
[00:46:24.872 --> 00:46:31.776]  That's been running for two weeks is about to end the info wars save him for war super sale nitric boost and so many other products 40.
[00:46:32.036 --> 00:46:34.438]  To 60% off.
[00:46:34.798 --> 00:46:38.240]  And then we're going to go into a holding pattern very soon.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.281]  We just find out whether we're going to survive or not.
[00:46:41.002 --> 00:46:43.864]  Whatever's left is going to go to full price till it sells out or until.
[00:46:44.878 --> 00:46:53.921]  We're able to have a buyer for the InfoWars assets, and then if I decide I like that buyer, I work for them, we continue on.
[00:46:54.001 --> 00:46:57.662]  If the bad guys buy it, which they're saying they're going to try to do, that's some breaking news here.
[00:46:58.082 --> 00:47:00.722]  I've known it for weeks, but I'm getting ready to do a whole report on it soon.
[00:47:01.823 --> 00:47:03.503]  Then they've taken over, and that's it.
[00:47:03.623 --> 00:47:12.786]  And then we get a new employer, and we try to set up a new operation, and I try to get the crew over there, and that's a whole other, you know, wild event.
[00:47:14.458 --> 00:47:19.961]  But right now, it looks like we're going to make it through the election, thanks to all your prayers and your action, and maybe indefinitely.
[00:47:20.881 --> 00:47:30.046]  But this is your last chance, potentially, to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get the shirt that's now in stock, shipping out, with the Trump fight, fight, fight fist image.
[00:47:30.986 --> 00:47:32.067]  That's a fundraiser.

[00:47:41.977 --> 00:47:49.902]  That said, whatever happens to InfoWars, my dad, who came up with a lot of these supplements, set up his own warehouse three years ago, two and a half years ago, in North Austin.
[00:47:51.123 --> 00:48:01.890]  And it's great, great service, great products, all the nano-silver products, flexible foundational energy, the KabaChill, the Top Brain, the Rocket Rest, these are all super strong, great formulas.

[00:48:13.779 --> 00:48:16.160]  So we need my daddies to capitalize as a sponsor.
[00:48:16.641 --> 00:48:17.641]  We need the funds.

[00:48:31.195 --> 00:48:37.561]  And I thank you all for your support, because it's up to you now whether or not we're going to be able to continue on.
[00:48:39.503 --> 00:48:44.027]  And believe me, if they're successful shutting us down, you're going to be like, oh, whoa, he's off the air.
[00:48:44.848 --> 00:48:47.731]  And I just remember, because I'm not bluffing you here, and I'm trying to keep us on air.
[00:48:47.751 --> 00:48:49.592]  I don't want to prove it to you about happening.
[00:48:50.674 --> 00:48:51.494]  You saw the headlines.
[00:48:51.574 --> 00:48:53.216]  InfoWorlds will be shut down, you know, a month ago.
[00:48:53.236 --> 00:48:54.277]  He'll be shut down next week.
[00:48:54.597 --> 00:48:55.198]  Judge blocked it.
[00:48:57.788 --> 00:49:00.910]  And we're just going to see if Judge Lopez continues down.
[00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:08.374]  He fired all the people that were that had been brought in, you know, by the federal government because they're just on a rotating deal.
[00:49:09.335 --> 00:49:10.175]  And he fired them all.
[00:49:10.395 --> 00:49:10.836]  The U.S.
[00:49:10.876 --> 00:49:16.399]  trustee, the CRO told him 10 times, you couldn't do all the things you did.
[00:49:16.759 --> 00:49:17.920]  It just he was outraged.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:23.963]  And one of my lawyers wanted to go to the judge earlier and others like, well, don't make a big thing in the court.
[00:49:24.003 --> 00:49:26.405]  But I should have I should have gone in there earlier.
[00:49:27.281 --> 00:49:28.702]  But this Judge Lopez is smart.
[00:49:28.762 --> 00:49:34.125]  He fired the last CRO a year and a half ago, who wasn't being evil on purpose.
[00:49:34.665 --> 00:49:35.585]  Just didn't know what he was doing.
[00:49:35.605 --> 00:49:36.526]  But this last guy...
[00:49:37.717 --> 00:49:42.862]  I mean, was a big leftist, absolutely out to get us, tried to set us up.
[00:49:43.423 --> 00:49:44.684]  It's been, it's been hellish.
[00:49:44.744 --> 00:49:48.468]  All the stuff you see happening to Trump, remember what Eric Trump famously said in a Fox interview?
[00:49:48.949 --> 00:49:51.692]  He said, look, for every attack you see, there's 10 you don't hear about.
[00:49:52.172 --> 00:49:55.956]  I'm not going to spend the show on all their attacks and what they've done because we got stuff to cover.
[00:49:56.336 --> 00:49:57.417]  But let me tell you, it has been
[00:49:58.957 --> 00:50:00.238]  Absolutely out of control.
[00:50:01.018 --> 00:50:01.999]  And thank you for your prayer.
[00:50:02.039 --> 00:50:02.899]  Thank you for your word of mouth.
[00:50:02.919 --> 00:50:03.700]  Thank you for your support.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:08.402]  Because that is the only reason that we are still on air here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:08.702 --> 00:50:10.043]  So I'm very thankful to all of you.
[00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:17.292]  But they're coming after all of Trump's key supporters, and we are right up there at the top.
[00:50:17.332 --> 00:50:18.833]  So thank you for keeping us on air.
[00:50:18.933 --> 00:50:21.954]  You're the reason we're still in the fight, and I want to be in the fight.
[00:50:22.354 --> 00:50:23.215]  I love being in the fight.
[00:50:23.275 --> 00:50:26.036]  I'm dedicated to the fight, so I salute you, and I humbly thank you.
[00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:27.916]  But take the articles from Infowars.com.
[00:50:28.517 --> 00:50:30.838]  Take the videos from Infowars.com, band.video.
[00:50:31.218 --> 00:50:36.680]  Take the links from RealAlexJones on X and hand-share them to your email list, your text messages.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:38.801]  Repost them everywhere.
[00:50:40.191 --> 00:50:44.835]  It's having a big effect, but fight like your life depends on it, because folks, it does.
[00:50:44.895 --> 00:50:46.396]  The left are insane.
[00:50:46.876 --> 00:50:48.097]  Worldwide, they're out of control.
[00:50:48.157 --> 00:50:53.361]  Now, that said, Naomi Wolf, formerly big advisor to the Clintons, been awake for years.
[00:50:54.222 --> 00:51:00.647]  She used to come on back when she was, you know, not fully awake, 15 years ago, 10 years ago, but she hadn't been on in like seven, eight years.
[00:51:00.667 --> 00:51:02.488]  She came on six months ago, three, four months ago.
[00:51:02.508 --> 00:51:03.309]  It was a huge interview.
[00:51:04.029 --> 00:51:06.551]  She's joining us to cover the waterfront coming up here next hour.
[00:51:07.452 --> 00:51:10.295]  And then I'm going to drill back into all the stuff.
[00:51:10.636 --> 00:51:15.481]  Ukraine, as Jack Posobiec said six months ago, has been attacking inside Russia with ground troops.
[00:51:15.922 --> 00:51:18.765]  The nuclear reactor is on fire, the biggest one in the world, in Ukraine.
[00:51:18.785 --> 00:51:19.626]  They're trying to buy the Russians.
[00:51:20.367 --> 00:51:21.848]  As we predicted, they do a false flag on that.
[00:51:21.868 --> 00:51:22.449]  I believe it is.
[00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:24.131]  We've got
[00:51:26.335 --> 00:51:32.576]  All the developments with the UK Prime Minister saying he's going to arrest Americans for free speech on a total power trip.
[00:51:32.616 --> 00:51:35.737]  And if Kamala is able to seal the election, she'll sign on to the extraditions.
[00:51:35.757 --> 00:51:37.517]  We're talking about arresting Elon Musk.
[00:51:37.637 --> 00:51:39.877]  I mean, it is getting crazy.
[00:51:40.598 --> 00:51:43.238]  So that's all coming up with all the other breaking news after she leaves us.
[00:51:43.818 --> 00:51:48.419]  And we'll give you a first look on what little birds have told me about what's coming up tonight, 7 o'clock Central, 8 p.m.
[00:51:48.459 --> 00:51:51.780]  Eastern, 6 o'clock Mountain, 5 p.m.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.460]  Pacific with Elon Musk interviewing
[00:51:54.784 --> 00:51:57.465]  Our embattled president, President Trump.
[00:51:57.625 --> 00:52:02.126]  All right, the great best-selling author, researcher, and former Clinton advisor, Naomi Wolf.
[00:52:02.146 --> 00:52:03.026]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[00:52:13.928 --> 00:52:21.930]  I want to tell you the story, the history of Infowars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high-quality supplements.
[00:52:22.964 --> 00:52:29.367]  Because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up, and it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[00:52:30.207 --> 00:52:45.253]  Going back about three years ago, during all of the platforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking, some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[00:52:45.593 --> 00:52:47.474]  We had five companies making product for us.
[00:52:48.074 --> 00:52:52.556]  Three of them notified us that, we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're InfoWars.
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:58.963]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[00:52:58.983 --> 00:53:01.865]  Not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[00:53:02.686 --> 00:53:16.094]  And they said, listen, you know we were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label
[00:53:17.376 --> 00:53:21.398]  On our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[00:53:21.818 --> 00:53:25.100]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup.
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:31.903]  And I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling our products and a lot of the products that we developed.
[00:53:32.583 --> 00:53:40.447]  But so many of these products that they had put out, again, were the exact same thing that we were putting out.
[00:53:41.463 --> 00:53:49.545]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private-labeled from them before we were even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[00:53:49.646 --> 00:53:56.268]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[00:53:56.428 --> 00:53:58.928]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[00:53:59.088 --> 00:54:01.009]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[00:54:01.209 --> 00:54:10.993]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[00:54:11.614 --> 00:54:14.015]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[00:54:14.075 --> 00:54:15.115]  Take Turmeric 95.
[00:54:16.796 --> 00:54:23.520]  Turmeric 95 isn't called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:29.283]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[00:54:29.383 --> 00:54:37.928]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[00:54:37.968 --> 00:54:40.389]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line, and
[00:54:41.656 --> 00:54:54.964]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[00:54:55.444 --> 00:54:59.847]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[00:54:59.907 --> 00:55:04.550]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[00:55:05.571 --> 00:55:10.774]  So I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[00:55:10.894 --> 00:55:11.495]  It's amazing.
[00:55:11.615 --> 00:55:12.555]  It's super high quality.
[00:55:12.615 --> 00:55:14.477]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:34.910]  Thank you.
[00:56:03.706 --> 00:56:06.569]  Well, she's very gracious to join us, and I really appreciate her coming on.
[00:56:06.609 --> 00:56:07.550]  She's with us for the hour.
[00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:08.872]  Dr. Naomi Wolf.
[00:56:09.352 --> 00:56:11.554]  I don't need to really give you her bio.
[00:56:11.715 --> 00:56:12.816]  Most folks know who she is.
[00:56:12.836 --> 00:56:19.303]  She's a best-selling author, been a top Clinton advisor, but for over a decade, or longer, has been exposing the deep state.
[00:56:19.563 --> 00:56:22.906]  Dailyclout.io, onX, at Naomi.
[00:56:23.927 --> 00:56:34.536]  I are Wolf and we'll reintroduce her coming up in five minutes because some stations don't carry this first five, but she's ready to come on right now and kind of give us a first look at the topic she wants to get into because I've got a lot of questions.
[00:56:34.556 --> 00:56:35.877]  I've been watching her playing her clips.
[00:56:36.298 --> 00:56:40.261]  I think we're pretty much on the same page, but she's got really a great way of explaining things.
[00:56:40.761 --> 00:56:45.605]  What are you most concerned about right now at this obviously incredibly critical juncture in human history?
[00:56:46.586 --> 00:56:50.870]  Yeah, there are two things I'd love to discuss with you and your audience today.
[00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:52.471]  One of them is to go over
[00:56:53.223 --> 00:57:15.655]  The campaign, obviously, as a former Democratic political consultant, I'm really worried about a lot of the steps and missteps that the Trump campaign is taking because I believe that, you know, I'm not partisan, but it's clear that the regime that's in power is wholly owned by our adversaries.
[00:57:16.513 --> 00:57:19.216]  I don't think it's partisan to want the opposition to win.
[00:57:19.696 --> 00:57:29.486]  So I do want to talk about, you know, how how not to campaign against Vice President Harris, how to win using what I know to be the Democratic playbook from my own experience.
[00:57:30.206 --> 00:57:40.156]  And the other thing I want to update your audience about is the fact that the most vaccinated country in the world, which is Singapore, is having a dramatic crash in live births.
[00:57:40.496 --> 00:57:59.666]  Yes, and this is something we've talked about because my team of 3,250 doctors and scientists know the reasons why, and I just want to tell your audience why and what they can do to keep our species from being damaged irrevocably, essentially.
[00:58:00.646 --> 00:58:01.406]  And that's so huge.
[00:58:01.467 --> 00:58:02.607]  I follow you almost every day.
[00:58:02.647 --> 00:58:03.348]  My wife listens.
[00:58:04.268 --> 00:58:05.749]  Every time you're live, she's a big fan.
[00:58:05.789 --> 00:58:08.251]  So a lot of times, I'm at the house and she's got you on the background.
[00:58:08.891 --> 00:58:15.635]  And I learn a lot of stuff listening to you because I kind of get distracted from all the vaccine stuff because so much is happening, even though I've been all over it.
[00:58:15.655 --> 00:58:23.180]  And I'm like, oh my God, I didn't know this was happening because as time passes, it becomes clear how truly horrible these shots were.
[00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:25.761]  And then, but people are kind of moving on.
[00:58:25.781 --> 00:58:26.722]  I think that's very dangerous.
[00:58:28.001 --> 00:58:29.342]  Yeah, it's tempting, right?
[00:58:29.403 --> 00:58:38.933]  We all want to put that horrible time in the rearview mirror and just get on with normal lives, such as our normal life is right now.
[00:58:39.834 --> 00:58:42.757]  But it's really important to pay attention to what's happening.
[00:58:43.458 --> 00:58:47.382]  We broke the story while I actually got deplatformed by the White House.
[00:58:47.762 --> 00:58:54.388]  When I was warning women in 2021 that the injections had menstrual dysregulation symptoms.
[00:58:54.908 --> 00:59:03.976]  And you don't, as I always say, you don't have to be a rocket scientist or even a medical doctor to know that if women are having menstrual symptoms in 2021,
[00:59:05.197 --> 00:59:09.462]  There are going to be fertility problems in 2024, and that's what's happening.
[00:59:10.283 --> 00:59:18.133]  Live births are crashing, not around the world, Alex, but they're crashing in the first world, essentially in the West.
[00:59:18.193 --> 00:59:20.436]  In Western Europe, there are a million missing
[00:59:21.296 --> 00:59:26.361]  I mean, babies that weren't born, you know, that would have been born otherwise.
[00:59:26.621 --> 00:59:31.985]  And in North America, in Canada, in the United States, birth rates are way down.
[00:59:32.005 --> 00:59:44.496]  And so Singapore is kind of the leading indicator of a mechanism that our team of doctors and scientists has established, you know, how these lipid nanoparticles block
[00:59:45.997 --> 00:59:56.044]  And this is in major studies.
[00:59:57.224 --> 01:00:00.146]  What's crazy is this is not even debatable, but you'll walk through all that.
[01:00:00.186 --> 01:00:02.568]  So first the campaign, what's happening there.
[01:00:02.588 --> 01:00:03.389]  We'll get into all the shots.
[01:00:03.449 --> 01:00:11.814]  And I saw you also talking about Hotez, who we know is a spokesperson for the military big pharma complex, saying, oh, let's use NATO.
[01:00:11.834 --> 01:00:13.455]  Let's use UN troops in America.
[01:00:13.495 --> 01:00:13.996]  I mean, this is
[01:00:14.876 --> 01:00:16.076]  Really whacked out stuff.
[01:00:16.116 --> 01:00:17.737]  So, Dr. Naomi Wolf is our guest.
[01:00:18.057 --> 01:00:21.177]  We'll go to break, join a bunch of stations, and she's going to launch straight into it.
[01:00:21.518 --> 01:00:23.278]  Very gracious to spend time with us today.
[01:00:23.638 --> 01:00:28.499]  Also get her best-selling book, The Pfizer Papers, by Dr. Naomi Wolf.
[01:00:28.899 --> 01:00:29.779]  Find that everywhere.
[01:00:30.219 --> 01:00:30.700]  Amazing.
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.140]  A great compliment to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.241]  's book, The Real Anthony Fauci, but updated.
[01:00:35.541 --> 01:00:36.241]  We'll be right back.
[01:00:36.261 --> 01:00:36.661]  Stay with us.
[01:00:37.341 --> 01:00:40.306]  Well, she's been coming on the show for more than 16, 17 years.
[01:00:40.326 --> 01:00:45.594]  Hadn't been on in many years, but I've always respected her as a real liberal, Dr. Naomi Wolf.
[01:00:46.255 --> 01:00:50.401]  And she's had amazing credibility and foresight and has really come out completely.
[01:00:51.587 --> 01:00:52.708]  I guess the Democratic Party.
[01:00:52.928 --> 01:01:01.677]  The Republicans have been evil for a long time, but the Democratic Party is really a fully owned subsidiary of these big BlackRock corporations and what they're doing.
[01:01:01.697 --> 01:01:08.444]  We've got a beachhead with Trump, as imperfect as he is, and she's been a top Democrat Party strategist, top strategist for the Clintons on record.
[01:01:09.405 --> 01:01:30.089]  So if you see them as, you know, kind of like the Sith, well, we've got, you know, Darth Vader, you know, I wouldn't say reformed because the world's moved on, you know, hindsight's 20-20, but she's written a very powerful, lengthy report that everybody should read, especially Trump, and I'm going to get this into his hands, how not to run against Vice President Harris.
[01:01:30.489 --> 01:01:31.410]  She knows their tricks.
[01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:32.790]  She knows their playbooks.
[01:01:33.631 --> 01:01:38.302]  And Trump is making, in my view, less mistakes than he made four years ago, but he's still making them.
[01:01:38.322 --> 01:01:39.645]  Not that I'm a total expert, but...
[01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:42.193]  She is an expert on this.
[01:01:42.233 --> 01:01:44.735]  She's going to speak to this for the next 25 minutes.
[01:01:44.775 --> 01:02:00.484]  Then we're going to do the deep dive on all the stuff that's come out with the COVID shots, the proof that it's causing massive infertility, massive reproductive problems, massive just general problems in women's reproductive systems, and so much more.
[01:02:01.045 --> 01:02:09.310]  And they're now trying to bring in a new pandemic with the monkeypox, and they're talking about declaring a new emergency, and they've done emergency authorization.
[01:02:10.050 --> 01:02:19.579]  Uh, for the bird flu, and then the Democrat operatives on TV are announcing wear your mask, and Harris is wearing them, so they're definitely trying to bring it back.
[01:02:19.839 --> 01:02:26.745]  So that's another huge area we'll discuss with her, but follow her on Substack, NaomiWolf.Substack.com.
[01:02:26.805 --> 01:02:31.729]  You can also find her at NaomiIRWolf on X and DailyCloud.io.
[01:02:31.989 --> 01:02:33.351]  So I'm going to try
[01:02:33.931 --> 01:02:39.156]  So shut up and let you roll here with the political angle that's so important, and then we're going to shift gears.
[01:02:39.176 --> 01:02:39.717]  Thanks for being here.
[01:02:40.718 --> 01:02:42.299]  Thanks so much for having me back.
[01:02:42.519 --> 01:02:43.380]  It's such a pleasure.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:48.886]  Well, so, you know, people who follow my work know that I am a classical liberal.
[01:02:48.926 --> 01:02:51.528]  I still think of myself that way, but I'm also a walkaway.
[01:02:51.548 --> 01:02:55.372]  I walked away from the Democrats because
[01:02:56.124 --> 01:02:56.484]  Thank you.
[01:03:14.975 --> 01:03:17.476]  There's been a coup, you know, and I said there'd been a coup.
[01:03:17.516 --> 01:03:23.517]  You and I first met when I was warning in 2007 that America could become a fascist regime.
[01:03:24.477 --> 01:03:28.518]  And you were one of the few people who believed it and was aligned with me then.
[01:03:29.679 --> 01:03:35.360]  We were really outliers at that time, but we were both prescient because America has become a fascist regime.
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:37.981]  Sadly, people didn't listen to us enough.
[01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:42.862]  And so now I'm convinced that not only is this regime
[01:03:44.764 --> 01:03:54.794]  Being run by probably our enemies and the globalists, right, in alliance with each other, probably China and the World Economic Forum in alliance with each other.
[01:03:55.314 --> 01:04:09.348]  But specifically, there's been kind of a double coup in the last two weeks in which, and I predicted it on July 21st, in which, as we now know, because Nancy Pelosi confirmed it yesterday, President Biden was ousted
[01:04:10.208 --> 01:04:10.949]  Railroaded.
[01:04:11.489 --> 01:04:26.881]  I said on July 21st that the letter that appeared on Twitter saying that he wasn't going to run for reelection didn't have any of the FEC qualifiers that are legally obligatory.
[01:04:26.961 --> 01:04:29.663]  You know, nothing saying I'm the candidate.
[01:04:29.763 --> 01:04:30.383]  I wrote this.
[01:04:30.904 --> 01:04:32.365]  This is my statement.
[01:04:33.086 --> 01:04:38.052]  And that the signature didn't match the Autopen signature.
[01:04:39.454 --> 01:04:40.796]  And then he vanished, right?
[01:04:40.816 --> 01:04:41.738]  You know, COVID.
[01:04:42.138 --> 01:04:48.287]  And you know from history, Alex, that when a king or a queen or a head of state
[01:04:48.887 --> 01:04:53.590]  Vanishes and there are rumors that that person is dead or incapacitated.
[01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:57.273]  There's always a kind of revelation of the person.
[01:04:57.313 --> 01:05:03.056]  They're always trotted out to reassure the masses that the head of state isn't dead or incapacitated.
[01:05:03.337 --> 01:05:06.739]  Well, that didn't happen for, like, seven or eight or nine days.
[01:05:07.419 --> 01:05:10.121]  And there was no kind of proof of life.
[01:05:10.701 --> 01:05:17.164]  So he appears not to be dead or incapacitated, but he's not answering reporters' questions in real time.
[01:05:17.265 --> 01:05:21.127]  And now we know, just to interrupt quickly, you're so right, he had an emergency in Vegas.
[01:05:21.187 --> 01:05:23.348]  I heard that day when Charlie Kirk was confirmed a week later.
[01:05:24.008 --> 01:05:30.452]  They fly him to Delaware, obviously drugged up or something happened, and then when he was finally seen eight days later, he can barely talk.
[01:05:31.132 --> 01:05:36.258]  So something went on during that period, and then now they admit it was an unlawful coup.
[01:05:36.278 --> 01:05:39.081]  I mean, even Pelosi says, oh, well, I didn't believe that letter.
[01:05:39.362 --> 01:05:43.406]  Why do you think—just to interrupt, because I want your gravitas on this—why is she now admitting this?
[01:05:43.446 --> 01:05:45.649]  Why is he in an interview admitting he was removed?
[01:05:45.689 --> 01:05:46.530]  What is the point of that?
[01:05:47.691 --> 01:05:50.034]  Well, that's a great question, Alex.
[01:05:52.266 --> 01:05:55.110]  And again, I predicted this in a previous essay.
[01:05:55.330 --> 01:06:02.739]  I don't mean to keep saying I predicted it, but knowing the Democrats, it's very easy to read from events what's likely to be happening.
[01:06:04.181 --> 01:06:07.826]  I warned after the assassination attempt on President
[01:06:08.346 --> 01:06:08.967]  We're good to go.
[01:06:38.446 --> 01:06:54.274]  Biden had pulled Secret Service away from Trump for her own event at the same time, 52 minutes away in Pennsylvania, as well as Mrs. Harris, Vice President Harris's event, also in Pennsylvania.
[01:06:54.394 --> 01:07:03.679]  So I thought many red flags pointed to Mrs. Harris and maybe Hunter, you know, in terms of not
[01:07:04.199 --> 01:07:12.807]  The thing about people at that level, Alex, is that they never say, oh, let's let an assassination attempt unfold against President Trump.
[01:07:12.847 --> 01:07:14.568]  You'll never have that deniability.
[01:07:14.588 --> 01:07:17.671]  I mean, you'll never have that directiveness, right?
[01:07:17.711 --> 01:07:19.132]  You'll always have deniability.
[01:07:19.353 --> 01:07:22.315]  You'll never have anyone making that request.
[01:07:22.656 --> 01:07:25.038]  But it's also the case that at that level,
[01:07:25.818 --> 01:07:34.421]  The principles will kind of indicate what kind of outcomes they would welcome without ever kind of saying so in writing or saying so overtly.
[01:07:34.902 --> 01:07:41.204]  So I guess what I'm trying to say is I wasn't surprised that Mrs. Biden and Biden
[01:07:41.784 --> 01:07:47.526]  Vanished quickly there, you know, soon after the assassination attempt that didn't succeed, right?
[01:07:47.646 --> 01:08:03.311]  Everybody thought that by now, everyone who was aware of the assassination attempt in advance would have thought that we'd have a different history right now, that the nation would be in mourning and that, God forbid, President Trump would no longer be with us and the whole chessboard would be different.
[01:08:03.351 --> 01:08:05.591]  Well, you know, God wasn't having that.
[01:08:05.911 --> 01:08:08.452]  So now they're scrambling, right?
[01:08:08.572 --> 01:08:11.213]  And one of the things I think is causing the chaos
[01:08:11.893 --> 01:08:15.298]  At the White House is there's a major crime that has to be covered up.
[01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:25.410]  And the crime is likely to be this allowing of the Secret Service to allow essentially someone to be murdered.
[01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:30.295]  I mean, someone died at that rally, allowing the attempt against Trump.
[01:08:32.036 --> 01:08:33.998]  You know, all of that has a paper trail.
[01:08:34.118 --> 01:08:36.760]  All of that has communications, right?
[01:08:36.821 --> 01:08:39.763]  They thought the Trump team would never be in possession.
[01:08:40.024 --> 01:08:44.828]  Exactly, because he'd be dead, they'd probably stage a false flag against a racial group.
[01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:48.592]  We're not predicting, we're forecasting, because they'd have the same playbook.
[01:08:49.093 --> 01:08:51.195]  And then they thought they could cover it up because he'd be back in power.
[01:08:51.635 --> 01:08:55.299]  Now they're scrambling with Ronald Rove, the head of the Secret Service, the interim head,
[01:08:55.779 --> 01:08:59.102]  I think the lady before him was obviously a puppet, but he was in charge.
[01:08:59.443 --> 01:09:03.106]  He lied to Congress and said he knew nothing and didn't even know who'd done what.
[01:09:03.407 --> 01:09:07.471]  Now we know he was in complete control, so they're in full panic mode right now.
[01:09:08.412 --> 01:09:09.132]  Well, exactly.
[01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:13.797]  And what you can clearly see is that there are at least two factions.
[01:09:14.778 --> 01:09:17.701]  The ones around Harris.
[01:09:18.823 --> 01:09:30.050]  Who seem in turn to stage a coup against the Biden family and now the Pelosi, Schumer, Obama group who are trying to stage a coup against the Harris team, right?
[01:09:30.511 --> 01:09:32.312]  So you've got the scramble for power.
[01:09:32.352 --> 01:09:37.135]  What's really scary for us, Alex, is that there's clearly no one running the country.
[01:09:37.828 --> 01:09:38.028]  Right?
[01:09:38.088 --> 01:09:41.649]  There's no one in a chain of command running the United States.
[01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:46.710]  And by the way, even the Washington Post and the New York Times admit they don't know who to go to to get orders now.
[01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:49.971]  They're even admitting, they're asking publicly who's in charge.
[01:09:50.611 --> 01:09:54.251]  Yeah, well that's a little late, New York Times and Washington Post.
[01:09:54.311 --> 01:09:57.952]  But yeah, I can tell you it's clear no one in the chain of command is in charge.
[01:09:58.252 --> 01:09:59.412]  Our enemies know it.
[01:09:59.492 --> 01:10:01.893]  That's why you have all of this instability
[01:10:02.333 --> 01:10:02.953]  We're good to go.
[01:10:19.341 --> 01:10:19.561]  Right.
[01:10:19.601 --> 01:10:25.046]  Meanwhile, people are scrambling to cover up, you know, a very, very serious crime or a set of crimes.
[01:10:25.106 --> 01:10:25.247]  Right.
[01:10:25.267 --> 01:10:26.988]  There are many, many crimes.
[01:10:27.028 --> 01:10:28.129]  Let me mention another one.
[01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:29.851]  Another big crime.
[01:10:30.011 --> 01:10:30.952]  Big crime.
[01:10:31.312 --> 01:10:31.472]  Right.
[01:10:31.492 --> 01:10:34.215]  Because again, they thought they'd have no opposition by now.
[01:10:34.555 --> 01:10:37.278]  That's how their planning unfolded.
[01:10:37.298 --> 01:10:39.079]  There will be no opposition by now.
[01:10:39.139 --> 01:10:40.681]  Well, a huge crime.
[01:10:41.101 --> 01:10:41.462]  Yeah, 85 million.
[01:10:41.522 --> 01:10:42.503]  Yeah, 85 million.
[01:10:59.696 --> 01:11:02.899]  Okay, well that, Alex, that is totally illegal!
[01:11:02.919 --> 01:11:04.921]  It is totally illegal!
[01:11:05.422 --> 01:11:12.989]  It is very laborious, according to the FEC, which regulates our campaigns, to throw your hat in the ring.
[01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:15.412]  You can't just take your hat out of the ring.
[01:11:15.452 --> 01:11:17.053]  That's also very laborious.
[01:11:17.073 --> 01:11:20.437]  It takes a lot of, you know, legal work, a lot of paperwork.
[01:11:20.897 --> 01:11:24.278]  And for sure, and check the FEC website, everyone.
[01:11:24.298 --> 01:11:25.339]  I'm not making this up.
[01:11:25.659 --> 01:11:26.339]  See it for yourself.
[01:11:26.679 --> 01:11:34.803]  For sure, you can't raise money for Candidate A and then switch out Candidate A with Candidate B. You can't do it.
[01:11:35.163 --> 01:11:38.724]  It violates every electoral law.
[01:11:38.744 --> 01:11:43.106]  Oh, we see Republicans going to jail all the time because they fly to Hawaii with their wife.
[01:11:44.096 --> 01:11:45.058]  Five years in prison.
[01:11:45.318 --> 01:11:50.346]  I mean, that's just giving... You know, I'm an election expert like you, but I can read the laws.
[01:11:50.406 --> 01:11:56.395]  I ran for representative for like two weeks and I saw the laws in Texas and I pulled out because I couldn't follow them.
[01:11:56.415 --> 01:11:57.136]  They were impossible.
[01:11:57.336 --> 01:11:58.739]  But as you're saying, this is blatant.
[01:11:59.534 --> 01:11:59.714]  Yeah.
[01:12:00.074 --> 01:12:00.855]  No, it's blatant.
[01:12:00.895 --> 01:12:09.680]  I mean, anyone, you know, for my book, When I First Met You, The End of America, I kind of kicked the tires of democracy and I looked at what does it take to run for Senate?
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.782]  And the, you know, you and I can't run for Senate.
[01:12:12.802 --> 01:12:16.144]  Well, as you discovered, we can't run for dog catcher, right?
[01:12:16.264 --> 01:12:24.989]  Because the FEC makes it so laborious, so many hurdles before you can even raise a dollar at a bake sale for your own campaign.
[01:12:25.329 --> 01:12:27.290]  That's one of the ways that they restrict
[01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:34.353]  You know, representation to people who are already blessed by the different major political parties.
[01:12:34.453 --> 01:12:49.079]  But all of that being said, the fact that the Harris campaign tried to just whack Harris in right where Biden stepped out, now we know without Biden's consent, right, or while he was unconscious or in the hospital, we don't know.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.941]  That is, you know, another gigantic crime.
[01:12:52.981 --> 01:13:00.546]  It is a series of felonies, and everyone who tried to do it engaged in kind of multiple acts of fraud.
[01:13:00.566 --> 01:13:02.827]  So they're going for broke, then let me ask you this, then.
[01:13:02.847 --> 01:13:10.371]  If they're all in disarray and camps a civil war kind of in the Democratic leadership over power, how does that extrapolate out to the election?
[01:13:10.391 --> 01:13:12.913]  Are they going to get reorganized?
[01:13:12.933 --> 01:13:14.033]  What do you expect them to do next?
[01:13:14.053 --> 01:13:15.214]  What are the mistakes Trump's making?
[01:13:15.234 --> 01:13:16.435]  I know you've written a big article about that.
[01:13:16.835 --> 01:13:32.318]  Yeah, well, so that's a great question, because the machine of the democratic kind of campaign system, including ActBlue, which is its fundraising arm, is so powerful and so kind of automated and digitized that
[01:13:32.999 --> 01:13:39.982]  They can win even if Trump actually wins and even RFK Jr.
[01:13:40.102 --> 01:13:40.782]  actually wins.
[01:13:41.102 --> 01:13:46.245]  And they can win even if Trump continues to make the mistakes.
[01:13:46.525 --> 01:13:49.266]  I'm sorry, if he stops making the mistakes that he's making.
[01:13:49.806 --> 01:13:54.208]  They can win even if Vice President Harris or whoever is now going to, you know,
[01:13:54.972 --> 01:13:58.614]  Be the coup person taking out Vice President Harris, right?
[01:13:58.834 --> 01:14:02.056]  Which looks like it's going to be AOC or Michelle Obama, if I'm abetting.
[01:14:02.476 --> 01:14:03.697]  By the way, let's speak to that.
[01:14:03.757 --> 01:14:04.217]  Exactly.
[01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:11.000]  Once you're in this cuckoo land, like the old Soviet Union or Operation Valkyrie with Hitler, who knows who's going to be in?
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:20.585]  And then once, like the old Roman Empire or third world country, once they start down this musical chairs thing, okay, wow, speak to that then.
[01:14:20.645 --> 01:14:21.686]  Wow, because that's key.
[01:14:21.886 --> 01:14:23.186]  Okay, but let me just finish.
[01:14:23.226 --> 01:14:23.967]  I'll shut up.
[01:14:23.987 --> 01:14:25.227]  Go ahead.
[01:14:25.267 --> 01:14:25.707]  That's okay.
[01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:27.348]  No, there's so much to cover.
[01:14:28.608 --> 01:14:37.992]  The machine is so effective and so automated that what I've been trying to warn the Trump team about in RFK Jr.
[01:14:38.012 --> 01:14:41.753]  2 is that basically
[01:14:42.975 --> 01:15:00.490]  If they don't get their act together and stay on message, literally the DNC can pop their puppet, whether it's Mrs. Harris, whether it's AOC, whether it's Mrs. Clinton, who I expect to also make a return appearance of some kind, or Mrs. Obama.
[01:15:00.810 --> 01:15:11.679]  They can just pop them into slots, essentially pop them into events with their canned speeches, with their focus-grouped soundbites, and just
[01:15:12.612 --> 01:15:13.092]  We're good to go.
[01:15:32.097 --> 01:15:32.918]  Tried to pass it.
[01:15:33.018 --> 01:15:35.340]  You know, three Republican legislators.
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:57.240]  That means that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Republican state legislators did not try to pass it, did not try to get rid of the voting machines, did not try to ensure paper ballots, same-day voting, voter ID, only citizens voting, no ballot harvesting, all of the simple ways that our easy bill cleans up the voting process.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.321]  So the point is,
[01:15:59.162 --> 01:16:20.323]  You know, literally, there's a channel that the Democrats can use and a playbook that they are using that I know by heart, I can run it in my sleep, that will just populate the surrogates, populate the ads, populate the events, populate the support from the unions and the teachers and the trial lawyers.
[01:16:20.723 --> 01:16:21.104]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:33.982]  That's that.
[01:16:34.283 --> 01:16:39.866]  And then Republicans, I promise you, if they don't wake up, Republicans and RFK Jr.
[01:16:39.886 --> 01:16:43.368]  supporters are going to wake up the day after Election Day saying, what happened?
[01:16:43.728 --> 01:16:46.190]  You know, our guy was doing so well.
[01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:47.851]  We were sure we had it in the bag.
[01:16:48.351 --> 01:16:48.651]  No.
[01:16:48.891 --> 01:16:53.234]  So that's why I wrote this essay warning both Trump and RFK Jr.
[01:16:53.374 --> 01:16:56.256]  what they need to do in order to outmaneuver that.
[01:16:57.975 --> 01:16:58.456]  Incredible.
[01:16:58.556 --> 01:17:01.298]  Now back to that other point that was actually on my list to ask you.
[01:17:01.318 --> 01:17:02.359]  I wrote this morning.
[01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:04.061]  I forgot to get to.
[01:17:04.722 --> 01:17:09.406]  Clearly, and Trump's alluded to this from his sources, they could try to replace Kamala.
[01:17:09.426 --> 01:17:10.988]  I mean, this is a very fluid thing.
[01:17:11.408 --> 01:17:18.275]  Once you're installing people that had zero votes in the primary, again, Ronald McDonald had the same amount of votes, zero, the sky's the limit.
[01:17:18.335 --> 01:17:19.096]  So speak to that.
[01:17:19.617 --> 01:17:19.817]  Right.
[01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:23.093]  Yeah, I mean, she's a terrible candidate.
[01:17:23.193 --> 01:17:25.116]  Everyone knows she's a terrible candidate.
[01:17:25.456 --> 01:17:26.438]  That doesn't stop them.
[01:17:26.638 --> 01:17:28.601]  No one likes her, but it doesn't stop them.
[01:17:28.621 --> 01:17:36.893]  And what people have to understand running against the Democrats is that Democratic voters have kind of gotten into this mindset through the Biden years,
[01:17:37.233 --> 01:17:37.453]  It's 1984.
[01:18:04.941 --> 01:18:14.785]  Yes, but also that people are reasoning that it's the technocrats around the candidate whom they're really voting for, right?
[01:18:14.825 --> 01:18:16.825]  That it's the right set of technocrats.
[01:18:16.865 --> 01:18:17.566]  The Deep State!
[01:18:18.506 --> 01:18:18.766]  Yeah.
[01:18:19.046 --> 01:18:20.947]  Well, yeah, but they don't think of it that way.
[01:18:21.047 --> 01:18:24.368]  They respectfully, because I still think like a Democrat.
[01:18:24.468 --> 01:18:25.569]  I'm still able to do that.
[01:18:26.069 --> 01:18:27.630]  And I also love a lot of Democrats.
[01:18:27.730 --> 01:18:28.330]  I understand.
[01:18:29.190 --> 01:18:30.871]  They look at the opposition.
[01:18:30.951 --> 01:18:34.052]  They look at, again, respectfully, Trump and
[01:18:34.712 --> 01:18:35.713]  And even J.D.
[01:18:35.773 --> 01:18:44.101]  Vance making mistake after mistake after mistake and with this kind of tenor of emotional lack of regulation.
[01:18:44.361 --> 01:18:45.983]  That's how Democrats process it.
[01:18:46.423 --> 01:18:53.890]  And so they're like, they're talking about cat ladies, you know, 40 something plus percent of Americans aren't even married.
[01:18:54.778 --> 01:19:05.165]  You know, one in five don't have children at all over the age of 50, and, you know, half of American women under 30 don't have kids, and so on.
[01:19:05.185 --> 01:19:10.268]  Like, a huge swath of the population gets offended by phrases like that.
[01:19:10.288 --> 01:19:11.609]  Whether they should or not isn't the issue.
[01:19:11.869 --> 01:19:13.890]  It's just an unnecessary mistake.
[01:19:14.731 --> 01:19:19.174]  Well, you definitely were one of their top advisors, so tell us, what would you do if you were Trump right now?
[01:19:20.896 --> 01:19:29.840]  But I will also tell you that for some reason my computer is not charging, so if I lose you, I'll call back on my phone, okay?
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:32.821]  Everything's plugged in, but I'm having some sort of technical issue.
[01:19:32.941 --> 01:19:34.562]  We're going to break in a few minutes.
[01:19:34.582 --> 01:19:35.142]  We'll figure it out.
[01:19:35.162 --> 01:19:35.503]  Keep going.
[01:19:36.503 --> 01:19:37.104]  All right, keep going.
[01:19:37.164 --> 01:19:44.589]  OK, what I would say, so what the big, the only thing is message discipline, message discipline, message discipline.
[01:19:44.889 --> 01:19:56.478]  Conservatives think that it's very fake and inauthentic to be on message, to have your talking points, to have your policy positions locked down and to stick to them.
[01:19:56.778 --> 01:19:57.559]  They love it.
[01:19:57.919 --> 01:20:00.740]  You're saying the Cat Lady stuff will energize Democrat voters?
[01:20:23.530 --> 01:20:46.068]  I'm saying that I know how the media works, and literally, if you are speaking to the Union of Black Journalists, and you can talk about all of your incredible policies, which are really strong, which I didn't know until I went and looked at them myself, that Trump delivered for communities of color, for instance, and everyone from 2016 to 2020, and you mention her race in any way,
[01:20:50.231 --> 01:20:52.672]  That is going to be the headline, right?
[01:20:52.712 --> 01:20:56.353]  There is no way to talk about it that is not going to be the headline.
[01:20:56.393 --> 01:21:06.277]  And so what happens then is NPR and CNN are waiting for Republicans to fall into, to step into that trap, to step on that mine, in that minefield.
[01:21:06.557 --> 01:21:09.818]  And they do it, Alex, over and over and over.
[01:21:10.259 --> 01:21:11.559]  Don't go there.
[01:21:11.859 --> 01:21:13.920]  Don't step on that mine.
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:19.302]  If you can just stay on message talking about crime, border,
[01:21:19.682 --> 01:21:25.504]  And they're also scared of him ending taxes on tips, which Kamala's got on.
[01:21:25.584 --> 01:21:28.024]  He needs to push on that, right?
[01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.730]  Absolutely.
[01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:40.411]  But they keep making mistakes.
[01:21:40.451 --> 01:21:41.432]  So Kamala stole it.
[01:21:41.753 --> 01:21:42.113]  Duh!
[01:21:42.153 --> 01:21:42.994]  That's the playbook.
[01:21:43.194 --> 01:21:47.338]  Everything your opponent does that's good, that's playing well, you steal it.
[01:21:47.779 --> 01:21:49.300]  I can tell you that's their playbook.
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:52.543]  But what they keep doing that's a mistake is reacting to that.
[01:21:52.584 --> 01:21:55.386]  So Trump is like, she's plagiarizing.
[01:21:55.466 --> 01:21:56.207]  She stole my thing.
[01:21:56.387 --> 01:21:56.868]  No!
[01:21:57.408 --> 01:21:58.549]  Stay on message.
[01:21:58.770 --> 01:21:59.691]  Ignore that.
[01:22:00.191 --> 01:22:08.219]  Stay on message or say something like, our policies are so good that our opponents are trying to take them on themselves.
[01:22:08.679 --> 01:22:17.227]  If she thinks it's such a good policy, why didn't she enact it in the last four years when she was helping to run this country and its economy into the ground?
[01:22:17.527 --> 01:22:19.429]  Why didn't she do it when she hired 80,000 IRS?
[01:22:21.431 --> 01:22:26.014]  agents to go over every single thing you might have done wrong in your tax return, right?
[01:22:26.295 --> 01:22:29.757]  There's so many substantive ways to stay on message.
[01:22:30.077 --> 01:22:38.083]  But instead, these leaders, Trump and Vance, respectfully, keep showing that they can be needled, right?
[01:22:38.143 --> 01:22:39.864]  They keep showing that they're reactive.
[01:22:40.164 --> 01:22:41.545]  That's not presidential.
[01:22:41.845 --> 01:22:43.767]  It's the surrogates who should be
[01:22:45.053 --> 01:22:45.953]  I totally agree.
[01:22:45.993 --> 01:22:47.214]  I'm not even a political operative.
[01:22:47.234 --> 01:22:49.774]  I'm just a talk show host that analyzes news, but it's very clear.
[01:22:50.114 --> 01:22:52.255]  Don't let them set the agenda when they do an attack.
[01:22:52.335 --> 01:22:55.196]  Ignore that and move with the truth and what's successful.
[01:22:55.636 --> 01:22:58.676]  Let's come back and finish up with that and then shift gears into where's Fauci?
[01:22:58.716 --> 01:22:59.657]  What is he up to?
[01:22:59.697 --> 01:23:01.477]  What's the numbers on the death shots?
[01:23:01.517 --> 01:23:04.258]  What's happening to women around the world who've taken these injections?
[01:23:04.658 --> 01:23:06.118]  It is shocking information.
[01:23:06.538 --> 01:23:08.039]  It is all coming up with our Naomi Wolf.
[01:23:08.059 --> 01:23:08.499]  Stay with us.
[01:23:09.279 --> 01:23:10.139]  Nitric boost.
[01:23:11.079 --> 01:23:11.540]  Turmeric 95.
[01:23:13.832 --> 01:23:16.755]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[01:23:17.696 --> 01:23:22.682]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[01:23:23.182 --> 01:23:30.330]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:32.852]  They let us private label their products.
[01:23:32.872 --> 01:23:33.773]  That's why you've already heard of
[01:23:35.996 --> 01:23:38.759]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[01:23:38.999 --> 01:23:40.320]  This is just their brand of that.
[01:23:40.661 --> 01:23:43.944]  And so it is available under Turmeric 95.
[01:23:44.345 --> 01:23:44.965]  That's the name.
[01:23:45.226 --> 01:23:50.892]  So we're sold out of bodies, but we have Turmeric 95 that is again the same concentrated
[01:23:51.372 --> 01:23:54.053]  Please welcome President Ronald Reagan, who has a few questions for you.
[01:23:54.113 --> 01:23:55.333]  All of you will go to the polls.
[01:23:55.353 --> 01:23:59.054]  You stand there in the polling place and make a decision.
[01:24:22.250 --> 01:24:25.272]  I think when you make that decision it might be well if you would ask yourself.
[01:24:26.772 --> 01:24:30.374]  Are you better off than you were four years ago?
[01:24:31.915 --> 01:24:35.637]  Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago?
[01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:40.959]  Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:46.142]  Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?
[01:24:47.202 --> 01:24:48.643]  Do you feel that our security
[01:24:50.203 --> 01:24:53.666]  Is as safe that we're as strong as we were four years ago.
[01:24:55.527 --> 01:25:06.336]  If you don't think that this course that we've been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have.
[01:25:07.217 --> 01:25:08.037]  President Trump.
[01:25:08.518 --> 01:25:10.920]  He'll make America great again.
[01:25:15.715 --> 01:25:16.516]  84 days left.
[01:25:16.997 --> 01:25:23.804]  Dr. Naomi Wolf, former top Democrat Party strategist, joins us finishing up with her advice to President Trump and where this election is going.
[01:25:23.824 --> 01:25:29.711]  I want to shift gears into what's happening with the biomedical attack on the world and the developments there.
[01:25:30.031 --> 01:25:30.792]  Doctor, please continue.
[01:25:31.801 --> 01:25:32.161]  Sure.
[01:25:32.681 --> 01:25:51.631]  Well, these things are related, you know, because people, when they're figuring out what to do in November, should consider that it was under Biden's regime, the Biden-Harris regime, that our economy was shut down, that we were lied to by a gigantic public health establishment under their command.
[01:25:52.511 --> 01:26:08.656]  That there was a massive transfer of wealth from working people and middle class people to gigantic corporations like Amazon and Microsoft and Google and everyone who profited from the lockdowns and the destruction of mom and pop shops in Main Street.
[01:26:09.876 --> 01:26:14.078]  And that they kept us in our homes, you know, against our constitutional right to assemble.
[01:26:14.418 --> 01:26:16.239]  They closed down churches and synagogues.
[01:26:16.259 --> 01:26:21.461]  They arrested people for, you know, holding prayer services and worship services.
[01:26:22.361 --> 01:26:24.182]  They kept your kids out of school for two years.
[01:26:24.222 --> 01:26:32.345]  I mean, I'm very surprised that none of that is entering the campaign discourse because all of that is at the feet of the Biden-Harris regime.
[01:26:32.405 --> 01:26:38.588]  You know, they made fun of, the Democrats made fun of President Trump when he tried to say rightly at the start of the pandemic,
[01:26:39.248 --> 01:26:40.930]  This is a matter for the states.
[01:26:41.230 --> 01:26:42.451]  He was exactly right.
[01:26:42.491 --> 01:26:44.273]  That's how our system is supposed to work.
[01:26:44.793 --> 01:27:00.727]  So among the things they did in lying to us, I'll never forget in 2021 when Biden gave a speech warning that the unvaccinated were facing a winter of severe disease and death and that we were a threat to our vaccinated loved ones.
[01:27:02.211 --> 01:27:11.924]  And I'll never forget the bills I had to pay for the cancelled family vacation when my vaccinated loved ones freaked out after hearing this, right?
[01:27:12.805 --> 01:27:14.928]  But they did that to us.
[01:27:14.968 --> 01:27:18.313]  They ushered in biomedical fascism.
[01:27:18.753 --> 01:27:25.461]  And they created a two-tier society overnight in which kids had to be injected to go to school.
[01:27:25.501 --> 01:27:27.463]  They had to be injected to play sports.
[01:27:27.483 --> 01:27:32.989]  You had to be injected to go say goodbye to your loved one who was dying in the hospice.
[01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:34.571]  That's all them.
[01:27:37.603 --> 01:27:49.107]  Now, looking at what was in that injection is very important because unfortunately, much as we want to forget about it, as you and I said at the start of this show, we all want to forget about it.
[01:27:50.387 --> 01:27:53.228]  The effects are cascading in.
[01:27:53.809 --> 01:27:55.009]  People are dropping dead.
[01:27:55.809 --> 01:28:03.432]  There are a million people, according to Ed Dowd, the former BlackRock hedge fund manager, a million Americans a month.
[01:28:03.792 --> 01:28:05.954]  Thank you so much for having me.
[01:28:25.089 --> 01:28:27.473]  And scientists know exactly why.
[01:28:28.594 --> 01:28:34.983]  We know that Pfizer knew within the three months of the data that we have killed 1,225 people.
[01:28:38.267 --> 01:28:47.715]  In some of the reports, like the stroke report and the liver report, half of the serious adverse events, including deaths, were within 48 hours after the injection.
[01:28:48.856 --> 01:28:56.563]  I mean, I could, you know, summarize all of the shocking headlines that our team discovered and that you can find in the book Pfizer papers right now.
[01:28:57.583 --> 01:29:06.609]  But the bottom line is this was the greatest crime against humanity in recorded history as the granddaughter of someone who lost nine brothers and sisters in the Holocaust.
[01:29:06.749 --> 01:29:09.490]  I don't say that lightly on a scale of numbers.
[01:29:09.570 --> 01:29:10.951]  It's larger than the Holocaust.
[01:29:11.652 --> 01:29:19.756]  And we're not done because this is a multi-generational crime against humanity.
[01:29:19.776 --> 01:29:24.119]  It includes future generations because these materials affect our DNA.
[01:29:25.416 --> 01:29:42.775]  And as I mentioned before, they also are going to affect future generations because at least baby boys in utero, their reproductive and developmental systems as turning into men right when they're when they hit puberty is is damaged by the injection.
[01:29:42.895 --> 01:29:43.796]  Babies are.
[01:29:44.582 --> 01:30:00.463]  Dying and going to convulsions, having swelling, having fevers from nursing from vaccinated moms, that lipid nanoparticles enter breast milk, that the scale of damage to women from menstrual dysregulation is catastrophic.
[01:30:01.246 --> 01:30:06.429]  Pfizer had a chart showing tens of thousands of women damaged menstrually.
[01:30:06.869 --> 01:30:08.450]  They just took note.
[01:30:08.850 --> 01:30:09.971]  15,000 women never bleeding.
[01:30:09.991 --> 01:30:12.612]  10,000 women bleeding twice a month.
[01:30:13.933 --> 01:30:15.154]  Women in their 80s bleeding.
[01:30:15.174 --> 01:30:17.295]  10-year-old girls bleeding upon being injected.
[01:30:17.635 --> 01:30:21.357]  The damage to women is off the charts.
[01:30:21.597 --> 01:30:24.138]  There are other horrible things, turbo cancers.
[01:30:24.278 --> 01:30:28.861]  Everyone knows that people are having rapidly escalating
[01:30:30.262 --> 01:30:38.950]  Cancers, especially of the breast and lung cancers and horrible tumors, glioblastomas, these are all in the Pfizer documents.
[01:30:39.090 --> 01:30:40.672]  The mechanism now is clear.
[01:30:41.513 --> 01:30:46.077]  There is a carcinogenic quality to these injections.
[01:30:46.738 --> 01:30:49.240]  People are seeing the brain damage in their loved ones.
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.342]  They're seeing their loved ones reacting differently.
[01:30:51.801 --> 01:30:54.663]  Unable to think in a nuanced way, personality changes.
[01:30:55.183 --> 01:31:12.432]  These lipid nanoparticles were engineered and known for 10 years, Alex, to cross every membrane in the human body, including the placenta, but also including the blood-brain barrier, so people are sustaining brain damage from receiving these injections.
[01:31:12.933 --> 01:31:18.796]  Neurological disorders are at catastrophic scale, and we saw this in the Pfizer documents.
[01:31:19.236 --> 01:31:23.559]  Epilepsies, dementias, Alzheimer's, convulsions, tremors.
[01:31:23.699 --> 01:31:26.802]  How many people do you all know out there who have a tremor?
[01:31:27.382 --> 01:31:35.548]  And we found the mechanism that the lipid nanoparticles kind of degrade the myelin sheath of the nerve endings.
[01:31:35.608 --> 01:31:38.070]  They make the nerves not function the way they should.
[01:31:39.031 --> 01:31:47.040]  So many people around you now are having hip replacements, knee replacements, they're limping, they're having mobility problems, they're in pain.
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:52.226]  Well, the number one side effect in the Pfizer documents is joint pain.
[01:31:52.626 --> 01:31:56.110]  Again, because of the inflammation from these lipid nanoparticles.
[01:31:56.250 --> 01:31:57.392]  Pain is inflammation.
[01:31:57.772 --> 01:31:59.174]  Arthritis is inflammation.
[01:32:00.054 --> 01:32:02.336]  The second most common side effect is myalgia.
[01:32:02.376 --> 01:32:03.516]  People just feel bad.
[01:32:03.556 --> 01:32:04.737]  That means muscle pain.
[01:32:05.197 --> 01:32:07.058]  People just don't feel well.
[01:32:07.539 --> 01:32:09.900]  And the third most common side effect, of course, is COVID.
[01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:13.262]  Because the vaccines didn't work to stop COVID.
[01:32:13.542 --> 01:32:15.823]  Pfizer knew this within a month after rollout.
[01:32:16.304 --> 01:32:23.788]  In fact, if they had not gotten rid of eight dead vaccinated people from their math, they would have had to report that
[01:32:24.815 --> 01:32:27.236]  Illegally, by the way, hiding their bodies, essentially.
[01:32:27.616 --> 01:32:38.238]  They would have had to report that vaccinated people die more often and get sick more often than do unvaccinated people, which is exactly what the data now show.
[01:32:38.618 --> 01:32:51.361]  So they knew all of this when they rolled out this injection and mandated it, mandated it on our armed forces, on our teachers, on our doctors and nurses, on our firefighters and police.
[01:32:52.142 --> 01:33:07.083]  On our college students, on our school children, and the last thing I'll say about this is this aligns with what you and I have been talking about for a couple of decades now when we do talk about fascism in America.
[01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.830]  Why?
[01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.391]  Right?
[01:33:09.471 --> 01:33:13.693]  You inject people with this injection, which is made in China.
[01:33:14.013 --> 01:33:15.154]  China owns the IP.
[01:33:15.554 --> 01:33:16.735]  China wants us gone.
[01:33:16.755 --> 01:33:22.819]  They want our food supply, our water supply, our ports, our energy grid.
[01:33:22.839 --> 01:33:24.400]  They don't want our population.
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.140]  Right?
[01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:28.342]  And then coming over the border is also related.
[01:33:28.362 --> 01:33:36.867]  30 million newcomers from countries that have no memory or knowledge of constitutional republic and human rights.
[01:33:37.568 --> 01:33:37.708]  And
[01:33:38.408 --> 01:33:48.023]  So the native born or kind of citizen Americans are sick and dying or not able to reproduce and the ones coming over the border.
[01:33:48.567 --> 01:33:59.550]  are not being mandated, and they're being ushered in with free food and lodging and room service in New York City and privileged treatment.
[01:33:59.670 --> 01:34:01.771]  So as Ed Dowd said, just wait five years.
[01:34:02.451 --> 01:34:08.553]  The population of America will be changed even without a war, and that is the war.
[01:34:09.749 --> 01:34:10.310]  Absolutely.
[01:34:10.330 --> 01:34:16.972]  And of course, you don't like to speculate, but 35,000 foot view, obviously, this is a large economic, cultural destabilization operation.
[01:34:16.992 --> 01:34:18.133]  If we could speak to that, that'd be great.
[01:34:18.173 --> 01:34:20.614]  But first off, let's talk about Singapore.
[01:34:20.654 --> 01:34:24.056]  Total fertility rates hit record low 2023.
[01:34:24.176 --> 01:34:26.897]  In all the countries that took the most shots, they're seeing this.
[01:34:26.917 --> 01:34:34.180]  And I remember Dr. Michael Yeadon and other top scientists, former, you know, Vice President of Pfizer, before the shots rolled out warned this would happen.
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:35.501]  And we had the FDA document.
[01:34:36.141 --> 01:34:37.441]  I wish I understood it better.
[01:34:37.481 --> 01:34:38.282]  I mean, I don't think that
[01:35:05.275 --> 01:35:09.899]  I don't think they told the American people the truth about these injections.
[01:35:09.939 --> 01:35:10.840]  I mean, I know they didn't.
[01:35:11.181 --> 01:35:16.846]  If they had, no one would have taken them because A, they don't work and B, they can kill you or sterilize you.
[01:35:18.695 --> 01:35:29.286]  And in fact, our team, with the emergence of this book, the Pfizer Papers, Pfizer's shares have tanked to 2016 levels.
[01:35:29.367 --> 01:35:32.810]  They've lost billions in market share, which, you know, you're welcome.
[01:35:33.331 --> 01:35:34.272]  I feel very proud of.
[01:35:35.833 --> 01:35:37.035]  We know they didn't because
[01:35:37.495 --> 01:35:58.323]  Well, many reasons, but one of the things we found, one of our lawyers FOIAed communications of the White House, and it turns out that in April and May of 2021, the CDC and the FDA and the White House were being warned that young adults and minors were sustaining heart damage, myocarditis, as you mentioned, pericarditis.
[01:35:58.883 --> 01:36:07.450]  And rather than holding a press conference to tell the American people, what we have in the FOIA documents is a freakout at the highest levels.
[01:36:08.211 --> 01:36:17.519]  And everyone, including Dr. Fauci, Dr. Walensky, who resigned three days after we showed that she knew that these injections were sterilizing women.
[01:36:18.502 --> 01:36:32.619]  And the head of the FDA and 15 White House staffers, right, were convening to hold a crisis communications conference to create a script to lie about it and to minimize it.
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:35.543]  And that's a 17-page document that is 100% redacted.
[01:36:37.345 --> 01:36:40.586]  Alex, we still don't know what the script is, but we know what happened.
[01:36:40.926 --> 01:36:55.211]  In April and May, instead of saying, this can cause myocarditis, pericarditis, don't give it to your child, they said for the whole rest of that year in a gigantic propaganda campaign, this may cause a little transient myocarditis.
[01:36:55.591 --> 01:36:56.312]  It's rare.
[01:36:56.472 --> 01:36:57.172]  It resolves.
[01:36:57.532 --> 01:37:02.896]  But the benefits outweigh the risks, and you've got to go ahead and inject your young adult, your college student.
[01:37:02.956 --> 01:37:03.716]  That's what they did.
[01:37:04.237 --> 01:37:06.878]  So I don't agree with this injection, they warned people.
[01:37:07.559 --> 01:37:16.565]  I do agree that something weird is going on with Nancy Pelosi coming forward and taking responsibility for the coup.
[01:37:17.105 --> 01:37:19.707]  And the reason I would speculate is, again,
[01:37:20.447 --> 01:37:26.750]  That there's some very, very serious crime that was committed by the White House.
[01:37:26.810 --> 01:37:29.491]  My guess is that it has to do with the assassination attempt.
[01:37:29.871 --> 01:37:33.193]  And so she's saying, we tried to get rid of these criminals.
[01:37:34.316 --> 01:37:36.918]  We tried to do the right thing by the country.
[01:37:36.958 --> 01:37:38.099]  That's exactly what I'm saying.
[01:37:38.139 --> 01:37:39.060]  So that's what I'm saying.
[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:45.465]  I feel like the FDA report in October 2000, warning of everything that would happen, somebody was trying to cover their ass.
[01:37:46.046 --> 01:37:47.287]  And this looks like the same thing.
[01:37:47.327 --> 01:37:51.410]  I'm not even trying to tie them together, other than it looks like cries for help, basically.
[01:37:52.731 --> 01:37:55.473]  Well, or a paper trail.
[01:37:55.533 --> 01:37:55.934]  CYA.
[01:37:56.963 --> 01:37:57.824]  Right, exactly.
[01:37:57.884 --> 01:37:58.944]  We had nothing to do with this.
[01:37:58.964 --> 01:38:00.365]  I had nothing to do with this.
[01:38:01.625 --> 01:38:02.466]  Although, you know what?
[01:38:02.506 --> 01:38:05.767]  In a democracy, if someone's a felon, you don't stage a coup.
[01:38:06.148 --> 01:38:10.189]  You actually arrest them or bring charges against them.
[01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:12.230]  You go through due process.
[01:38:13.591 --> 01:38:21.575]  How far gone are they, Alex, that she thinks that telling the American people that she tried to stage the good coup as opposed to the bad coup is
[01:38:22.036 --> 01:38:33.456]  Well, yeah, that's what makes them so dangerous, is it's clearly these factions all pretended like they were in control, but really, like, end-stage empires, it's created a giant mess.
[01:38:34.622 --> 01:38:36.464]  Well, I mean, again, look back at history.
[01:38:36.484 --> 01:38:45.413]  This is what happens when there's a power vacuum in a very corrupt monarchy or, you know, empires.
[01:38:45.473 --> 01:38:55.183]  I mean, the end of the Roman Empire, people were stabbing each other and throwing each other to the wolves and killing their own children so that they wouldn't be, you know, overthrown
[01:38:55.943 --> 01:38:57.704]  Or poisoned by their relatives.
[01:38:58.545 --> 01:39:02.508]  You see this in history again and again, but not in a democracy.
[01:39:03.509 --> 01:39:05.810]  These are the people who were so upset about J6.
[01:39:06.231 --> 01:39:09.333]  We're supposed to have a peaceful succession of power.
[01:39:09.893 --> 01:39:14.296]  There is a clear process for moving out the demented guy, right?
[01:39:14.336 --> 01:39:16.478]  It's Article 25 of the Constitution.
[01:39:16.938 --> 01:39:23.803]  And moving on to, you know, now the vice president is president and now the speaker, I believe, is the vice president.
[01:39:24.084 --> 01:39:30.648]  Like, our founders thought about all of this and they set an orderly, peaceful process in place for all of it.
[01:39:31.009 --> 01:39:37.934]  But there's such corrupt chaos at the top where they no longer think they have to, like,
[01:39:38.795 --> 01:39:40.936]  Stick to the cosmetics of having a democracy.
[01:39:41.156 --> 01:39:41.656]  Exactly.
[01:39:41.736 --> 01:39:43.897]  So the veneer of civilization is peeling away.
[01:39:43.917 --> 01:39:45.518]  I know you've talked about this, I've seen your show.
[01:39:46.538 --> 01:39:49.960]  Here's Biden saying there won't be a peaceful transfer.
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:53.261]  Then he slips up and says, oh, I mean, I mean, if he's defeated.
[01:39:54.002 --> 01:40:02.165]  And then we've got Raskin talking, who he knows is one of their top planners, about how we're going to have civil war conditions if Trump wins.
[01:40:02.525 --> 01:40:04.006]  We're going to remove him with this amendment.
[01:40:04.266 --> 01:40:05.847]  I want to get your take on this.
[01:40:05.867 --> 01:40:06.227]  Here it is.
[01:40:07.007 --> 01:40:08.008]  Are you confident?
[01:40:09.229 --> 01:40:13.331]  That there will be a peaceful transfer of power in January 2025.
[01:40:14.111 --> 01:40:17.273]  If Trump wins, no I'm not confident at all.
[01:40:17.713 --> 01:40:30.139]  So it's going to be up to us on January 6, 2025 to tell the rampaging Trump mobs that he's disqualified and then we need bodyguards for everybody in civil war condition.
[01:40:34.001 --> 01:40:35.022]  Are you confident
[01:40:36.226 --> 01:40:40.327]  That there will be a peaceful transfer of power in January 2025.
[01:40:40.767 --> 01:40:44.268]  If Trump wins, no, I'm not confident at all.
[01:40:45.128 --> 01:40:47.109]  I mean, if Trump loses, I'm not confident at all.
[01:40:48.409 --> 01:40:53.910]  So, this is super creepy, and they're all over the news, civil war, they're all over the news.
[01:40:55.470 --> 01:41:00.612]  Where do you see this going, Dr. Naomi Wolf, and do you think the deep state will try another assassination attempt?
[01:41:03.005 --> 01:41:06.788]  Oh, first of all, I'm trying to process that Jamie Raskin clip, which I hadn't seen.
[01:41:06.808 --> 01:41:08.990]  That is so scary.
[01:41:09.010 --> 01:41:09.490]  I mean...
[01:41:11.465 --> 01:41:12.646]  He is not demented.
[01:41:12.866 --> 01:41:13.786]  And that was a threat.
[01:41:14.026 --> 01:41:17.388]  I mean, he's basically saying, we're not gonna let it happen.
[01:41:17.448 --> 01:41:19.789]  We're not gonna let them take power, even if they win.
[01:41:19.829 --> 01:41:20.469]  He's saying that.
[01:41:20.929 --> 01:41:30.753]  And he's saying they'd rather have civil war than to yield peacefully to a Trump administration if Trump is the clear, obvious victor.
[01:41:31.253 --> 01:41:32.994]  That's so frightening.
[01:41:33.114 --> 01:41:34.715]  And it's frightening because it is a threat.
[01:41:34.835 --> 01:41:39.797]  And remember, at that point, they'll still have the military and the National Guard, and they'll have
[01:41:40.595 --> 01:41:52.066]  They're saying we no longer are committing to abide by the principles of our democracy, which involves a peaceful transfer of power rather than rank bloodshed and no rule of law.
[01:41:52.106 --> 01:41:52.706]  They're saying it.
[01:41:53.167 --> 01:41:54.228]  That's so scary.
[01:41:55.429 --> 01:42:00.674]  And when Biden says it, you know, you can justify it because he is demented.
[01:42:02.741 --> 01:42:08.065]  I also, knowing them, when he makes that mistake, my guess is that it's not a mistake.
[01:42:08.105 --> 01:42:09.646]  He's on script and these are threats.
[01:42:10.106 --> 01:42:15.129]  And, you know, I'm amazed at Trump, as annoyed as I get at him, for not staying on message.
[01:42:15.349 --> 01:42:16.610]  He's a courageous man.
[01:42:16.850 --> 01:42:19.932]  And when you say, do I think there will be another assassination attempt?
[01:42:20.192 --> 01:42:22.614]  I think they haven't stopped trying to assassinate him.
[01:42:22.954 --> 01:42:25.976]  His plane landed, an emergency landing.
[01:42:26.756 --> 01:42:28.398]  I'm, whatever, 61 years old.
[01:42:29.562 --> 01:42:30.923]  I've flown my whole life.
[01:42:31.484 --> 01:42:35.527]  Never, ever, ever have I been in a plane that had an emergency landing.
[01:42:35.667 --> 01:42:36.728]  What are the odds?
[01:42:37.268 --> 01:42:47.015]  I'm really afraid that he's... I mean, if the Secret Service has basically made it clear that they almost let you be killed, right?
[01:42:47.436 --> 01:42:55.562]  And you're dependent on Secret Service protection, which I don't quite understand, because he can afford his own Z private security.
[01:42:56.630 --> 01:42:58.971]  You know, that's a hostage situation, right?
[01:42:59.091 --> 01:43:05.712]  So I'm not at all confident that they're not going to keep trying and keep trying to do away with President Trump.
[01:43:05.872 --> 01:43:09.413]  It's a Byzantine situation now, Alex.
[01:43:09.533 --> 01:43:12.814]  And let's look at, like, opposition leaders.
[01:43:13.274 --> 01:43:14.694]  Steve Bannon is in jail.
[01:43:14.974 --> 01:43:17.155]  They tried to take you out economically.
[01:43:17.195 --> 01:43:18.335]  They tried to take
[01:43:19.815 --> 01:43:21.516]  They imprisoned Peter Navarro.
[01:43:21.916 --> 01:43:25.437]  You know, all of these opposition leaders, they went after the Epoch Times.
[01:43:25.897 --> 01:43:38.821]  All of this independent media and opposition leaders are being either law-feared into silence or preoccupation, economically pressed into silence or preoccupation, or physically restrained.
[01:43:38.961 --> 01:43:42.982]  I mean, Steve Bannon would keep this ship moving along.
[01:43:43.582 --> 01:43:49.086]  You know, he's not allowed to speak to the American people until right before the election.
[01:43:49.187 --> 01:43:50.247]  How convenient is that?
[01:43:51.709 --> 01:43:55.071]  So we're all being targeted, you know, the last of us who are
[01:43:56.653 --> 01:44:08.195]  Openly challenging this administration, but I guess what I'm trying to say is this is what happens in the death throes of a democracy and the birth of a truly lawless regime.
[01:44:08.916 --> 01:44:14.957]  There's no longer a pretense that people aren't being physically and economically targeted, legally targeted.
[01:44:15.257 --> 01:44:21.458]  There's not even a cosmetic veneer that they're not trying to go after the opposition, including President Trump.
[01:44:21.838 --> 01:44:23.439]  So, I mean, God willing, I'm wrong.
[01:44:23.519 --> 01:44:25.639]  I hope he survives and thrives and wins.
[01:44:26.079 --> 01:44:27.480]  I hope he and RFK Jr.
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:29.582]  join forces and they win together.
[01:44:29.642 --> 01:44:30.282]  That's what I hope.
[01:44:30.743 --> 01:44:33.485]  But, um, and again, I don't think that's partisan.
[01:44:33.525 --> 01:44:35.886]  I'm saying it because otherwise it's not America.
[01:44:35.926 --> 01:44:37.267]  These people are not Americans.
[01:44:37.688 --> 01:44:38.728]  And they've said so.
[01:44:38.788 --> 01:44:44.693]  For Jamie Raskin to say we're not going to let them have it, that's, it is the end of America.
[01:44:44.733 --> 01:44:47.415]  It's the end of America when he says that, right?
[01:44:47.455 --> 01:44:48.976]  We've got to recognize what time it is.
[01:44:48.996 --> 01:44:51.017]  These people are no longer Americans.
[01:44:51.898 --> 01:44:53.179]  They don't want an American system.
[01:44:56.636 --> 01:44:59.258]  Well, in the time we have left, I think you've totally nailed it.
[01:45:00.338 --> 01:45:03.940]  You know, we're living in such historic times, and I've read a lot of history.
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:07.702]  Historians say people don't usually realize it when they're in such a serious time.
[01:45:07.742 --> 01:45:10.284]  You've got Ukraine invading Russia.
[01:45:10.664 --> 01:45:12.245]  You've got heavy weapons being shipped in.
[01:45:12.285 --> 01:45:14.286]  You've got Israel and Iran attacking each other.
[01:45:15.487 --> 01:45:18.769]  This clearly is what happened in World War I and World War II, but to the next level.
[01:45:20.250 --> 01:45:24.892]  And we're not even talking about the geopolitics of China, you know, doing blockades of Taiwan.
[01:45:24.952 --> 01:45:35.776]  I mean, and the borders collapsed, and we've got political infighting, and just insane levels of, I think it's just total incompetence, really, at the end of the day.
[01:45:35.796 --> 01:45:40.779]  I mean, they've kind of inherited the old power structure that was operating and had problems, but at least it was competent.
[01:45:41.239 --> 01:45:48.582]  And I just think we've reached a total incompetence point, and I just wonder if there's any way to get sanity back and try to turn this around.
[01:45:51.704 --> 01:45:57.574]  Well, yeah, I mean at this point I think it's a battle between good and evil on a metaphysical level.
[01:45:57.774 --> 01:46:03.043]  It almost goes beyond human capacities, it seems to me.
[01:46:04.386 --> 01:46:15.016]  There's so much kind of divine intervention that's so bizarrely miraculous right now, and also the demons are so demonic, you know, it's like the veils are falling from both good and evil, right?
[01:46:15.377 --> 01:46:22.484]  We've talked about this too, so I sort of feel like this is America's testing point, right?
[01:46:23.224 --> 01:46:28.930]  I feel personally, personally, that God, you know, is kind of
[01:46:29.753 --> 01:46:30.173]  Thank you so much.
[01:46:47.865 --> 01:46:49.627]  Or are we going to collude with
[01:47:06.223 --> 01:47:07.504]  Skype just broke up.
[01:47:07.524 --> 01:47:08.504]  Reconnect with her.
[01:47:08.584 --> 01:47:11.465]  I want her to finish up in five more minutes.
[01:47:11.545 --> 01:47:12.125]  The next hour.
[01:47:12.145 --> 01:47:13.806]  Yeah, this is literally good versus evil.
[01:47:34.465 --> 01:47:36.887]  These are people going against their own self-interest.
[01:47:39.269 --> 01:47:40.951]  It's the mystery of evil the Bible talks about.
[01:47:40.991 --> 01:47:41.871]  Old Testament, New Testament.
[01:47:41.891 --> 01:47:45.214]  I mean, this is real wrath of God stuff here.
[01:47:45.534 --> 01:47:47.456]  This is, we're being judged.
[01:47:47.496 --> 01:47:48.637]  This is super dangerous.
[01:47:48.677 --> 01:47:49.598]  You can see it everywhere.
[01:47:50.118 --> 01:47:51.039]  People are flipping out.
[01:47:51.379 --> 01:47:52.560]  Her computer might have finally died.
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:53.902]  She had a problem with her cord.
[01:47:53.962 --> 01:47:54.582]  Call her on the phone.
[01:47:55.043 --> 01:47:56.023]  So I wanted to finish her point.
[01:47:56.043 --> 01:47:58.285]  At the end of the day, this is good versus evil.
[01:47:58.425 --> 01:47:59.747]  And this is crazy.
[01:48:00.632 --> 01:48:04.274]  And Republicans think it's all fun, and Trump's invincible, and Democrats all think they're invincible.
[01:48:04.414 --> 01:48:05.215]  It's crazy.
[01:48:06.756 --> 01:48:07.496]  And it's dangerous.
[01:48:08.417 --> 01:48:10.198]  All right, hour number three coming up.
[01:48:11.459 --> 01:48:13.540]  And we'll see if we can get Amy Wolpeck on to finish up.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.101]  If not, I will continue on and cover all the news.
[01:48:16.742 --> 01:48:18.883]  We haven't hit yet, but what a time to be alive.
[01:48:19.383 --> 01:48:21.725]  Now's the time to get on your knees and pray to God, folks.
[01:48:22.298 --> 01:48:23.499]  We'll be right back.
[01:48:38.067 --> 01:48:44.389]  That has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation, and that's because of the grace of God, and your support, and our intrepid crew.
[01:48:44.869 --> 01:48:54.612]  And I'm asking you now, at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down, and put everybody in prison, to double down and support the broadcast more than ever.
[01:48:54.632 --> 01:49:00.614]  To share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:49:00.814 --> 01:49:00.974]  So,
[01:49:01.534 --> 01:49:09.921]  Two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[01:49:10.282 --> 01:49:11.423]  These are very, very popular.
[01:49:11.483 --> 01:49:12.524]  And I went looking up online.
[01:49:12.924 --> 01:49:14.185]  It is very, very popular.
[01:49:14.445 --> 01:49:15.386]  It's not an investment.
[01:49:15.566 --> 01:49:16.187]  It's a collectible.
[01:49:16.387 --> 01:49:19.390]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's
[01:49:19.870 --> 01:49:23.293]  Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:49:23.733 --> 01:49:27.736]  Best group out there, highest ratings, amazing prices, the best.
[01:49:27.996 --> 01:49:32.039]  This is a collectible at a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[01:49:32.579 --> 01:49:40.325]  Then the bankruptcy started and the people that came in from the courts said, we're not going to keep the outside people's products in here, in your store.
[01:49:41.426 --> 01:49:42.247]  And they kicked him back.
[01:49:43.511 --> 01:49:47.113]  To the folks, despite the fact we'd already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[01:49:47.413 --> 01:49:58.560]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company, and now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:07.465]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[01:50:08.045 --> 01:50:09.366]  They're amazing cards.
[01:50:09.386 --> 01:50:11.206]  It's got original art I came up with.
[01:50:11.226 --> 01:50:13.127]  It's got the little bar of gold in there.
[01:50:13.187 --> 01:50:16.088]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Info War.
[01:50:16.108 --> 01:50:16.908]  You'll have a historical memento.
[01:50:32.234 --> 01:50:40.118]  This is a historic fight, and this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[01:50:40.478 --> 01:50:41.799]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[01:50:42.459 --> 01:50:45.340]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:48.922]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[01:50:49.282 --> 01:50:54.124]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[01:50:54.505 --> 01:50:56.606]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[01:50:57.406 --> 01:50:59.387]  We've only got a few thousand of these left.
[01:50:59.867 --> 01:51:03.370]  And I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:03.990]  Now, I want to be clear.
[01:51:04.551 --> 01:51:06.752]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[01:51:06.772 --> 01:51:07.453]  That's not what this is.
[01:51:07.513 --> 01:51:08.634]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[01:51:09.214 --> 01:51:22.324]  This is like, on NPR, if it still gets taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug that costs them $5, or a baseball cap that costs them $10, and you make a $100 donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the New World Order.
[01:51:22.584 --> 01:51:23.505]  I know you don't want to do that.
[01:51:24.225 --> 01:51:27.226]  This cost, I think they told me, more than $10 per card.
[01:51:28.047 --> 01:51:29.367]  Something like that, $10 or $11.
[01:51:29.907 --> 01:51:34.609]  And so, the other $80-something will go to fund the operation.
[01:51:34.649 --> 01:51:37.770]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[01:51:38.311 --> 01:51:45.994]  So, get your collectible card, your piece of art, with the little piece of gold in it, today, and you will help keep us on air.
[01:51:46.354 --> 01:51:47.454]  The decision is yours.
[01:51:47.474 --> 01:51:48.895]  This is a limited edition.
[01:51:49.535 --> 01:51:53.857]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[01:51:54.538 --> 01:52:04.843]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time, and myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.
[01:52:05.203 --> 01:52:14.108]  So please take action now at InfoWarsTore.com and get the exclusive InfoWars Limited Edition Proprietary 24-Karat 999 Pure Gold Collectible.
[01:52:14.488 --> 01:52:15.369]  Thank you for your support.
[01:52:15.709 --> 01:52:17.370]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[01:52:23.274 --> 01:52:24.495]  This is the final battle.
[01:52:25.255 --> 01:52:28.216]  With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state.
[01:52:28.296 --> 01:52:31.118]  We will expel the warmongers from our government.
[01:52:31.158 --> 01:52:32.999]  We will drive out the globalists.
[01:52:33.099 --> 01:52:36.380]  We will cast out the communists, Marxists, and fascists.
[01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:40.742]  We will throw off the sick political class that hates our country.
[01:52:40.922 --> 01:52:43.524]  We will rout the fake news media.
[01:52:43.624 --> 01:52:48.606]  And we will liberate America from these villains once and for all.
[01:52:58.502 --> 01:53:00.684]  I am Kamala Harris.
[01:53:01.025 --> 01:53:02.306]  My pronouns are she and her.
[01:53:02.346 --> 01:53:04.909]  You're considered the most liberal United States senator.
[01:53:04.929 --> 01:53:12.397]  I... Well, actually, the nonpartisan GovTrack has rated you as the most liberal senator.
[01:53:12.417 --> 01:53:16.442]  Do you have any plans to visit the border?
[01:53:16.602 --> 01:53:17.583]  We are going to the border.
[01:53:17.663 --> 01:53:18.444]  We've been to the border.
[01:53:18.464 --> 01:53:19.325]  You haven't been to the border.
[01:53:20.972 --> 01:53:22.212]  And I haven't been to Europe.
[01:53:22.953 --> 01:53:27.874]  I am in favor of saying that we're not going to treat people who are undocumented and cross-border as criminals.
[01:53:27.934 --> 01:53:28.394]  That's correct.
[01:53:28.614 --> 01:53:29.214]  That is correct.
[01:53:29.234 --> 01:53:33.715]  A lot of the signs at the rally you just held were people standing there saying, abolish ICE.
[01:53:34.275 --> 01:53:34.355]  Yeah.
[01:53:34.395 --> 01:53:37.176]  Is that a position that you agree with?
[01:53:37.396 --> 01:53:39.517]  We need to probably think about starting from scratch.
[01:53:39.897 --> 01:53:45.258]  So you support giving universal health care, Medicare for all, to people who are in this country illegally?
[01:53:45.778 --> 01:53:51.821]  I'm opposed to any policy that would deny, in our country, any human being public health.
[01:53:52.261 --> 01:53:52.642]  Period.
[01:53:54.543 --> 01:53:55.863]  Argue for defunding the police.
[01:53:56.063 --> 01:53:57.844]  How are you defining defund the police?
[01:53:57.944 --> 01:54:04.648]  It's actually wrong and backward to think that more police officers will create more safety.
[01:54:04.848 --> 01:54:06.389]  We need to get rid of money bail.
[01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:10.311]  Convicted, in prison, like the Boston Marathon bomber, on death row.
[01:54:10.351 --> 01:54:13.272]  People who are convicted of sexual assault, they should be able to vote?
[01:54:13.852 --> 01:54:15.073]  I think we should have that conversation.
[01:54:17.123 --> 01:54:21.407]  I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal.
[01:54:21.727 --> 01:54:23.748]  I have always supported Medicare for All.
[01:54:23.828 --> 01:54:28.272]  I was very happy to sign on to Bernie's bill, and I give Bernie, frankly, a lot of credit.
[01:54:28.432 --> 01:54:30.314]  There's no question I'm in favor of banning crack.
[01:54:30.454 --> 01:54:31.775]  Do you ban plastic straws?
[01:54:32.295 --> 01:54:32.936]  I think we should.
[01:54:37.659 --> 01:54:39.701]  Is New York's Donald Trump running for president?
[01:54:41.684 --> 01:54:49.110]  He bought full-page ads in three East Coast newspapers today, stating his views on foreign policy, and these ads will win him a following.
[01:54:51.211 --> 01:54:56.796]  In the ads he says, there's nothing wrong with American foreign policy, that little backbone won't cure.
[01:54:58.297 --> 01:55:02.300]  And he says, we have no business spending ourselves broke in the Middle East.
[01:55:03.081 --> 01:55:06.264]  Protecting ships that are not ours and oil that we don't need.
[01:55:06.404 --> 01:55:09.047]  Rumblings in the Trump camp point as far as the presidency.
[01:55:09.287 --> 01:55:11.269]  Somebody has to help this country.
[01:55:11.469 --> 01:55:14.452]  And if they don't, the country and the world are in big trouble.
[01:55:14.853 --> 01:55:20.258]  Because within a short period of time, as sure as we're sitting here, there's not going to be a country and there's not going to be a world.
[01:55:20.619 --> 01:55:22.240]  I have no intention of running for president.
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:25.924]  And if it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally.
[01:55:28.874 --> 01:55:37.099]  Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:48.826]  For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government, while the people have borne the cost.
[01:55:50.187 --> 01:55:53.849]  That all changes starting right here,
[01:55:54.745 --> 01:55:55.506]  And right now.
[01:55:56.328 --> 01:55:58.731]  Because this moment is your moment.
[01:55:58.852 --> 01:56:00.594]  It belongs to you.
[01:56:03.766 --> 01:56:09.210]  The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
[01:56:09.310 --> 01:56:13.412]  Trump leading in five of the six most important battleground states.
[01:56:13.452 --> 01:56:15.554]  Biden continues to trail Donald Trump.
[01:56:15.634 --> 01:56:21.237]  Our latest polling out of Iowa also shows former President Trump with a 30 point lead over his newest rival.
[01:56:21.257 --> 01:56:23.039]  The Republican primary is over.
[01:56:23.079 --> 01:56:26.441]  Donald Trump basically has this nation locked up.
[01:56:33.251 --> 01:56:34.912]  Everyone is listening to you now.
[01:56:37.292 --> 01:56:45.394]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down.
[01:56:46.615 --> 01:56:49.996]  My fellow Americans, our movement is far from over.
[01:56:50.416 --> 01:56:53.997]  In fact, our fight has only just begun.
[01:57:10.333 --> 01:57:16.395]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:57:16.795 --> 01:57:18.295]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:57:21.136 --> 01:57:26.617]  All right, I'm going to explain something here that's extremely important and I hope people really let this sink in.
[01:57:26.657 --> 01:57:28.017]  I know most listeners already know this.
[01:57:28.037 --> 01:57:31.318]  A lot of you probably know more of this than I do, but for people that don't understand this,
[01:57:33.097 --> 01:57:33.397]  I don't know.
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:56.342]  Europe, Mesoamerica, everywhere, the same stuff was done over and over again.
[01:57:56.362 --> 01:57:57.642]  Humans act the same over and over again.
[01:57:58.282 --> 01:58:04.605]  People today want Ferraris and big houses to impress people, but back then, they built big giant government buildings, big giant temples to impress people.
[01:58:06.506 --> 01:58:11.128]  And there becomes this idea in kind of the general public that, oh, the government's all powerful.
[01:58:12.369 --> 01:58:18.272]  And then the delusional people in government, a few generations into power, start actually believing.
[01:58:21.041 --> 01:58:40.090]  And so they're trying to project all this power, and it does give them a lot of power in a republic, that if you have a permanent bureaucracy, that's in government, corporations, academia, and other systems, that you can't get in trouble because nobody knows your name, politicians come and go, the policies are unpopular, but you don't get to blame.
[01:58:42.091 --> 01:58:48.435]  So that's been their strength since the end of World War II and the 1947 National Security Act and the creation of the CIA.
[01:58:50.418 --> 01:58:54.119]  But as bad as some of those people were, they were still competent.
[01:58:56.020 --> 01:59:00.322]  You're now three, four generations into people who are not competent.
[01:59:01.402 --> 01:59:09.925]  And so you can have a puppet like Biden in there, so Obama and other special interests can get what they want done and not get the blame for it.
[01:59:10.825 --> 01:59:14.967]  But the bureaucrats start to figure out nobody's watching the shop.
[01:59:18.672 --> 01:59:24.436]  And so, years will go by now, and our government doesn't even talk to Putin.
[01:59:25.117 --> 01:59:26.478]  He says, it's been years, nobody calls me.
[01:59:26.978 --> 01:59:28.939]  They might talk to Xi Jinping every six months.
[01:59:31.601 --> 01:59:32.121]  Imagine that?
[01:59:34.163 --> 01:59:39.587]  And they just think, we're America, we have the nuclear weapons, we have the cashless society, we're unstoppable.
[01:59:39.987 --> 01:59:45.371]  Oh, well, blacks and Hispanics are voting Republican, we'll just bring in 40 million people and have them vote for us.
[01:59:46.667 --> 01:59:49.449]  And they don't think about second, third, fifth order effects.
[01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:58.857]  So this country, and other countries are corrupt and out of control as well, is a runaway train right now.
[02:00:01.479 --> 02:00:03.180]  I don't want civil war with the Democrats.
[02:00:03.281 --> 02:00:04.061]  I don't want a war.
[02:00:05.562 --> 02:00:07.444]  These people are their own worst enemies.
[02:00:09.606 --> 02:00:12.548]  And I sent the crew some of the videos that I didn't see on the list.
[02:00:12.588 --> 02:00:13.189]  Maybe I missed them.
[02:00:15.031 --> 02:00:20.655]  Jack Posobiec tweeted one of these women at one of the rallies, and they literally sound like Muppets.
[02:00:20.715 --> 02:00:22.336]  That's what I said in the comment.
[02:00:22.376 --> 02:00:23.877]  I said, these people sound like Muppets.
[02:00:24.817 --> 02:00:26.458]  And they're like, she's a woman.
[02:00:26.518 --> 02:00:27.299]  She's black.
[02:00:27.519 --> 02:00:28.439]  I want to support her.
[02:00:30.341 --> 02:00:33.542]  And they're just giggling incoherently, like they're the women.
[02:00:34.003 --> 02:00:34.903]  We're going to win.
[02:00:34.963 --> 02:00:35.684]  We're going to win.
[02:00:37.441 --> 02:00:40.923]  And this woman they're supporting was literally selected and installed.
[02:00:41.643 --> 02:00:42.403]  It is a coup.
[02:00:42.984 --> 02:00:45.145]  She's completely stupid and out of control.
[02:00:48.066 --> 02:00:50.607]  And then you start studying the bureaucracy behind her.
[02:00:50.868 --> 02:00:51.708]  They're just as bad.
[02:00:52.909 --> 02:00:59.252]  My God, you've seen how they've been putting in charge of Health and Human Services a crazy, creepy dude with long hair who says he's a woman?
[02:01:00.117 --> 02:01:01.558]  Who's in charge of nuclear stockpiles?
[02:01:01.578 --> 02:01:04.580]  Some crazy dude that steals people's luggage over and over again?
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:06.901]  I mean, this is just, yeah, yeah, here's the clip.
[02:01:07.221 --> 02:01:08.522]  These are lunatics, folks.
[02:01:09.163 --> 02:01:15.546]  So we can laugh at them all day, but they're flying the plane that we're all on.
[02:01:16.847 --> 02:01:17.568]  And it's not funny.
[02:01:19.529 --> 02:01:27.854]  And it's really a byproduct of our open, free society that we've been so open and been so friendly and been so empowering
[02:01:29.056 --> 02:01:37.002]  That then a bunch of lesser people have gotten into control and they have no idea what they're even doing and don't even care.
[02:01:42.446 --> 02:01:46.570]  And there's just mass mental illness because, you know, when somebody's got to go out and
[02:01:47.398 --> 02:01:47.758]  I don't know.
[02:02:03.496 --> 02:02:04.537]  People have become decadent.
[02:02:04.898 --> 02:02:08.041]  And that kind of goes with the globalist argument of, well, we've got to depopulate people.
[02:02:08.341 --> 02:02:10.884]  But they're the most inbred, worst people themselves!
[02:02:11.805 --> 02:02:15.189]  I would respect King Charles if he killed himself on national television.
[02:02:15.469 --> 02:02:19.214]  Horrible, inbred, sycophant, parasite, useless.
[02:02:19.514 --> 02:02:21.416]  I'm not trying to kill him myself, not calling for violence.
[02:02:21.877 --> 02:02:23.398]  I'm just saying, he wants to get rid of all of us?
[02:02:23.739 --> 02:02:24.199]  Kill yourself!
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:35.867]  If he got up on TV and blew his brains out, or poured gasoline on himself, lit himself on fire because there's too many people, I'd say, if Greta Thunberg got on TV and poured gasoline on herself, and lit herself off, I'd say, man, I really respect that.
[02:02:36.588 --> 02:02:38.009]  I don't agree with it, but I respect you now.
[02:02:38.829 --> 02:02:47.675]  If Klaus Schwab got up on TV and, you know, took a meat cleaver and just cut his left arm off, and just sprayed butter, and then slid his throat on TV, I'd say, wow, I really respect that.
[02:02:47.855 --> 02:02:50.217]  There's so many people, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, you know, I'd be like, wow.
[02:02:51.220 --> 02:02:54.763]  Or maybe get a Japanese short story out and commit seppuku on TV.
[02:02:55.483 --> 02:02:56.184]  I would respect that.
[02:02:56.244 --> 02:02:57.145]  I've never committed suicide.
[02:02:57.165 --> 02:02:58.986]  I'm saying, they want everybody dead.
[02:02:59.006 --> 02:03:00.568]  Bill Gates talks about there's too many people all day.
[02:03:00.948 --> 02:03:02.789]  He wants you to take a shot so he can save you.
[02:03:02.809 --> 02:03:03.850]  I mean, come on.
[02:03:05.451 --> 02:03:11.276]  So, that'd be quite the unveiling if Prince Charles poured a gallon of gas on himself and lit it.
[02:03:11.316 --> 02:03:13.998]  But see, he's the essence of a fop.
[02:03:14.539 --> 02:03:15.840]  The essence of a charlatan.
[02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:16.941]  The essence of a fraud.
[02:03:18.123 --> 02:03:18.643]  Of a dandy.
[02:03:19.224 --> 02:03:25.006]  So he's not going to be killing himself like his father wanted to come back as a virus to kill 80% of the world's population.
[02:03:25.026 --> 02:03:25.947]  Look it up, Prince Philip.
[02:03:26.447 --> 02:03:27.588]  He wants you to die.
[02:03:28.628 --> 02:03:30.009]  He flies around on jets all day.
[02:03:30.049 --> 02:03:30.969]  He's got a private train.
[02:03:31.289 --> 02:03:32.510]  He's got palaces everywhere.
[02:03:35.371 --> 02:03:36.352]  But you get nothing.
[02:03:38.213 --> 02:03:41.874]  And really, if you sit there and let these predators run things, I guess you deserve nothing.
[02:03:45.556 --> 02:03:47.217]  People like Prince Charles never did an honest
[02:03:48.444 --> 02:03:48.944]  We're good to go.
[02:04:19.127 --> 02:04:26.311]  They're supposedly the coolest, greatest thing in the world, and through the universities they control, the systems they run, you see who they are.
[02:04:30.033 --> 02:04:31.794]  So, we're really at the end of the line here.
[02:04:34.015 --> 02:04:46.121]  And I'll cover some of that news coming up, but... What's really crazy is, they hit the first world that has the highest education, and on average, the highest IQs,
[02:04:47.495 --> 02:04:54.939]  And that have historical, whether they're Asian, white, you name it, background to keep families going and stabilize society.
[02:04:55.319 --> 02:04:57.820]  And those are all the countries where they're sterilizing everybody.
[02:04:58.460 --> 02:04:59.841]  Again, because they're in competition.
[02:05:00.301 --> 02:05:04.083]  They go, we don't want other smart people, or people that have a history of freedom.
[02:05:04.123 --> 02:05:05.704]  We want as dumb as we can get.
[02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:29.030]  So that we're in charge as if they'll launch a war with eight and a half billion people and cut off resources and create an angrier world and as if that ensuing maelstrom of war and famine and violence as if they will somehow stay on target and stay in charge during
[02:05:30.031 --> 02:05:32.293]  The total release of chaos, which shows it's spiritual.
[02:05:32.673 --> 02:05:33.674]  They're not in control.
[02:05:33.714 --> 02:05:46.824]  They just follow an instinct to dumb down and dominate and steal and kill and destroy, even though the chivalry of the West and the due process is what actually protected them and allowed them to grow to where they are.
[02:05:47.764 --> 02:05:52.368]  So see, I'm kind of not endorsing freedom right now, but that's not what I believe.
[02:05:52.728 --> 02:05:54.509]  What I'm saying is it is a paradox.
[02:05:55.424 --> 02:05:57.265]  That these people are destroying their own house.
[02:05:57.325 --> 02:05:58.406]  They're burning their own bed.
[02:05:58.446 --> 02:06:00.287]  They're burning their own nest.
[02:06:00.408 --> 02:06:05.571]  They are... And anybody that actually studies history and is engaged and involved in intelligence, like, why?
[02:06:05.671 --> 02:06:06.792]  Why are you doing this?
[02:06:08.433 --> 02:06:10.214]  And it's because they love their father, the devil.
[02:06:10.395 --> 02:06:13.737]  I mean, Naomi Wolf's Skype cut out at the end of the interview.
[02:06:13.757 --> 02:06:17.760]  She was making some really good points about good versus evil, but that's really where we are.
[02:06:19.321 --> 02:06:21.102]  And that's really what this has come down to.
[02:06:23.023 --> 02:06:24.885]  And you look at the French Revolution, which is the...
[02:06:26.069 --> 02:06:29.474]  Precursor to modern communism.
[02:06:31.376 --> 02:06:35.121]  They promised we're gonna overthrow the church and the royalty and everything's gonna be free and wonderful.
[02:06:35.141 --> 02:06:37.364]  Have nine day work weeks though and no more family.
[02:06:37.424 --> 02:06:41.129]  And it was just like destroy society.
[02:06:42.128 --> 02:06:44.871]  And people really quick figured out, whoa, this is tyranny.
[02:06:45.411 --> 02:06:46.112]  This is horrible.
[02:06:46.412 --> 02:06:50.556]  So then they got an emperor right away, who then led them to even bigger wars and death and destruction.
[02:06:51.037 --> 02:06:57.163]  Kind of like the pressure that Germany was under under the Weimar Republic and the Versailles Treaty, then conjures Hitler.
[02:06:59.105 --> 02:07:00.687]  And then you saw what came out of that.
[02:07:02.288 --> 02:07:03.449]  And so here's the difference.
[02:07:04.210 --> 02:07:04.751]  You can look at
[02:07:06.865 --> 02:07:07.846]  1,800 in the French Revolution.
[02:07:07.866 --> 02:07:11.169]  You can look at 1933 in the Nazi Revolution.
[02:07:11.189 --> 02:07:17.877]  You can look at 1917 in the Russian Revolution, Communist Revolution, or 1949, the Maoist Revolution, or any of that.
[02:07:17.897 --> 02:07:19.038]  Or, you know, 1960, Belcastro. 59.
[02:07:27.216 --> 02:07:29.657]  But it always leads to destruction in the end.
[02:07:29.917 --> 02:07:33.619]  Whether it's fascist or communist, whatever flavor it is, it's all cyanide.
[02:07:33.839 --> 02:07:38.201]  You can have a cherry or a grape snow cone, but you put cyanide in them, they'll both kill you dead in a hammer.
[02:07:41.162 --> 02:07:51.147]  And I just sit back, seeing the mental illness and insanity spreading, and the decadence and the ignorance and just the... And I'm just like, whoa.
[02:07:51.967 --> 02:07:54.268]  I mean, this is big time problems.
[02:07:57.458 --> 02:08:05.964]  And I go to these rig courts and see these people that are out to get me and they laugh at me and they point like that means something to me that they're laughing and I'm like, I ain't laughing at you.
[02:08:06.665 --> 02:08:08.326]  You're like at the edge of oblivion right now.
[02:08:09.517 --> 02:08:16.102]  But I guess that's kind of a saving grace for the ignorant, or the spiritually blind, is that they're in their own metaverse, man.
[02:08:16.643 --> 02:08:36.218]  They think everything's great, and they're in charge, and CNN's their friend, the New York Times is their friend, but if they looked around themselves at the death, and the disease, and the cancer, and the collapse, and their kids committing suicide, and the unhappiness, and you'd want to, you know, say, obviously this isn't the right path, because I study the globalist.
[02:08:36.818 --> 02:08:45.061]  And they are the most miserable, and their servants as well, the most miserable, unhappy people you could ever imagine in your life.
[02:08:48.283 --> 02:08:50.523]  So I could sit here and cover all this news, and I will.
[02:08:50.824 --> 02:08:51.564]  And boy, there's a lot of it.
[02:08:51.604 --> 02:08:52.264]  It's all interesting.
[02:08:52.304 --> 02:08:56.106]  But man, at the end of the day, we're already watching the collapse of civilization.
[02:08:56.146 --> 02:08:57.346]  We're well into it now.
[02:08:58.367 --> 02:09:01.828]  And that's the thing, is the realization
[02:09:06.499 --> 02:09:14.846]  That getting Trump in will be a big victory over their tyranny and override their systems, but he's gonna still have to people his operation from folks that are from the system.
[02:09:15.246 --> 02:09:20.350]  And even though they're better than the globalists, thoroughbreds, still, there's just an inherent weakness.
[02:09:21.871 --> 02:09:26.255]  And not by Trump, I'm just saying in Washington and the bureaucratic system.
[02:09:27.095 --> 02:09:32.720]  And so, historically, it takes total collapse and most people dying
[02:09:34.431 --> 02:09:39.254]  For the new era to rise and a new golden era to start.
[02:09:41.315 --> 02:09:44.316]  And so my job is just telling you what I really think.
[02:09:45.657 --> 02:09:49.219]  And I see evil digging in.
[02:09:49.339 --> 02:09:51.440]  I see the mental illness increasing.
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:53.821]  I see the spiritual wickedness intensifying.
[02:09:55.322 --> 02:10:00.565]  And I'm just surprised God hadn't already just out of existence the earth.
[02:10:01.245 --> 02:10:02.786]  But God's putting us through this test.
[02:10:04.039 --> 02:10:13.425]  Like Naomi Wolf was saying, to see who we are, because you can't rationally sit back and look at this and see people that work for the system going out of their way to be destroyed.
[02:10:15.506 --> 02:10:24.371]  And when the truth would serve them, they won't even tell it because their religion is that they cannot tell the truth because they are the people of the lie.
[02:10:24.391 --> 02:10:32.316]  And they can be old, young, they can be supposedly Christian, supposedly Jewish, supposedly Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, whatever, agnostic, whatever.
[02:10:32.816 --> 02:10:46.821]  They just rebel in BS and it must be a weird place in your mind to just believe crap and just have no idea what's going on because I'm constantly trying to figure out what's going on and I've got a good idea about a lot of things but I know that I know nothing as Socrates said.
[02:10:47.681 --> 02:10:59.326]  These people think that they know everything and they don't and you talk to them and they're dumb and they have no idea about anything and they don't want prosperity and they don't want
[02:11:00.236 --> 02:11:07.758]  They just want to hurt people and run around all crazy and do weird stuff and steal stuff and gibber and giggle.
[02:11:07.878 --> 02:11:12.720]  And we don't just handpick weirdos from Democrat Party rallies.
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:18.461]  I mean, I can watch hours of the raw footage and they are like barking seals.
[02:11:18.501 --> 02:11:22.042]  They're like completely out of their minds.
[02:11:26.624 --> 02:11:27.464]  And I just say, wow.
[02:11:28.843 --> 02:11:30.644]  I just hope my children don't turn out like that.
[02:11:31.405 --> 02:11:33.266]  I just hope they have some civilization to live in.
[02:11:33.306 --> 02:11:34.287]  I don't even hate these women.
[02:11:35.287 --> 02:11:36.168]  I don't even dislike them.
[02:11:36.188 --> 02:11:38.329]  The fact that they're so pathetic makes me feel pathetic.
[02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:47.155]  I've got enemies in my life that have done terrible things to me, but as I've gotten older and more mature, I like, it makes me feel bad for humanity itself, and like, I feel guilty.
[02:11:48.676 --> 02:11:53.880]  People I've been associated with that lied about me and did terrible things to me for no reason, and I look, I think about it, I'm just like, wow.
[02:11:55.916 --> 02:11:59.037]  What does it say about me that I even associated with these people that I didn't see it?
[02:12:00.358 --> 02:12:02.599]  But it's that they weren't that bad before.
[02:12:02.659 --> 02:12:05.720]  This is a waxing of evil.
[02:12:06.220 --> 02:12:08.561]  An intensification of corruption.
[02:12:10.762 --> 02:12:15.464]  And... I'm just telling people to get ready.
[02:12:16.725 --> 02:12:17.485]  You better get ready.
[02:12:18.151 --> 02:12:19.512]  Because they got something big planned.
[02:12:19.532 --> 02:12:31.200]  Those open borders, all those millions of military-age men marched in with the same backpacks and boots from China and the Middle East and... I mean, I... I'll just be honest with you.
[02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:33.301]  I feel guilty that I'm even still here on air.
[02:12:34.082 --> 02:12:36.143]  But I don't even know exactly how they're gonna hit or what they're gonna do.
[02:12:36.163 --> 02:12:37.604]  I'm just sitting here going like, whoa.
[02:12:38.865 --> 02:12:40.566]  Like, the enemy's coming over the parapets.
[02:12:40.807 --> 02:12:41.907]  The city is collapsing.
[02:12:41.947 --> 02:12:42.588]  It's on fire.
[02:12:43.128 --> 02:12:43.749]  And I just see...
[02:12:44.830 --> 02:12:48.031]  Most people still like, hey, what's going on?
[02:12:48.051 --> 02:12:50.732]  And I'm like, do you not know what's going on?
[02:12:55.855 --> 02:12:58.155]  So, that's where we're at.
[02:12:58.316 --> 02:13:00.877]  I've got some more news I can hit here, and I've got a lot to say.
[02:13:02.297 --> 02:13:07.399]  But I just look at this, I mean, I'll cover it when we come back.
[02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:11.101]  I want to air a Greg Reeves report, it's really important I can get to.
[02:13:14.226 --> 02:13:16.117]  70,000 terrorists with biometric U.S.
[02:13:16.137 --> 02:13:16.660]  passports.
[02:13:17.864 --> 02:13:20.966]  She covered this last week with either a report on it or a breakdown of it.
[02:13:20.986 --> 02:13:21.807]  Laura Logan, here it is.
[02:13:48.164 --> 02:14:03.037]  There was an open source meeting, or people knew about a meeting of the Director of Central Intelligence at the time, Burns, was down there meeting with other officials and members of the Taliban.
[02:14:04.398 --> 02:14:08.121]  But I've talked to several people that have intimate knowledge of that meeting.
[02:14:08.882 --> 02:14:15.307]  And they're telling me, or they're asking the question, why were there two senior Chinese intel officials at that meeting?
[02:14:16.161 --> 02:14:24.993]  Why was Siraj Haqqani, who at the time we had a $10 million bounty from the State Department on him at that meeting?
[02:14:25.473 --> 02:14:34.245]  And the other thing is there was a senior official or senior officer from the IRGC, the Iranian Republican Guard.
[02:14:35.316 --> 02:14:38.877]  Who was a Quds Force commander that we're very familiar with from Iraq.
[02:14:39.617 --> 02:14:42.737]  He's a very, very competent officer.
[02:14:43.278 --> 02:14:43.858]  He was there.
[02:14:44.418 --> 02:14:48.298]  They didn't even use CIA personnel for security.
[02:14:48.779 --> 02:14:59.581]  They were so concerned from what I'm hearing about the people they were meeting with that they used one of our tier one groups for security and they kept them on the outside.
[02:14:59.621 --> 02:15:01.361]  They weren't allowed to listen in or anything.
[02:15:01.992 --> 02:15:02.932]  And after the U.S.
[02:15:02.972 --> 02:15:12.256]  government abandoned trusted personnel and billions of dollars worth of weapons in Afghanistan, the Communist Chinese secured it within two weeks.
[02:15:12.816 --> 02:15:16.257]  Bagram Airfield, when we left there first, went completely black.
[02:15:16.317 --> 02:15:16.937]  It was dark.
[02:15:17.157 --> 02:15:27.181]  The people that were there said that two large Chinese transport planes landed with troops and secured that area.
[02:15:28.212 --> 02:15:34.599]  70,000 jihadis have graduated from Afghan terrorist training camps in just this year alone.
[02:15:34.619 --> 02:15:38.363]  These are actual terrorist training madrasas?
[02:15:38.964 --> 02:15:39.164]  Right.
[02:15:39.225 --> 02:15:46.353]  Madrasas that train people on small arms tactics, on bomb making, on basic
[02:15:47.390 --> 02:16:08.471]  Intelligence tradecraft and we know for a fact because we have several assets in all over Afghanistan That they graduated this year was their largest graduating class from all the madrasas and these are for what they would call Jihadis guys that were gonna go and fight the holy war and they said they had over 70,000 graduates
[02:16:10.914 --> 02:16:12.155]  And not only did the U.S.
[02:16:12.215 --> 02:16:18.880]  leave behind weapons, it left behind biometric data and the kit required to make official U.S.
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:19.561]  passports.
[02:16:20.141 --> 02:16:25.705]  The Afghans have the ability through their passport office to create biometric passports.
[02:16:26.065 --> 02:16:34.932]  Not only did we leave behind biometric equipment, but the intelligence services are responsible for setting up the passport office.
[02:16:35.473 --> 02:16:38.455]  Let's just say documentation stamps and things like that.
[02:16:39.524 --> 02:16:49.953]  And there's been several questions asked, did we leave certain pieces of equipment that would be used in a passport office to authenticate passports behind?
[02:16:50.053 --> 02:16:53.716]  And my understanding, and from what I've been discovering, is we did.
[02:16:54.395 --> 02:16:58.778]  Western nations are under attack from traitors within their own governments.
[02:16:59.278 --> 02:17:02.440]  The people of Ireland and the UK are beginning to stand up.
[02:17:03.021 --> 02:17:11.686]  In response, combat journalist Michael Yawn recently explained what typically happens within the native population when a nation is invaded.
[02:17:11.966 --> 02:17:21.332]  When there is an actual invasion from an outside force, the minorities or people who feel that they've been downtrodden
[02:17:22.373 --> 02:17:25.654]  Almost in every single case, we'll join with the invader.
[02:17:27.134 --> 02:17:29.435]  In fact, I can't think of one where they did not.
[02:17:29.815 --> 02:17:37.458]  That concerns me greatly with the United States because we are clearly being invaded and it's clearly going to intensify, for instance, with the Chinese.
[02:17:37.878 --> 02:17:45.440]  And many people will join the Chinese, including a lot of white people, by the way, will join up with them and already are, including our government.
[02:17:45.860 --> 02:17:46.360]  We're good to go.
[02:18:04.071 --> 02:18:05.171]  That's a losing battle.
[02:18:05.691 --> 02:18:07.552]  That means you end up dying.
[02:18:08.392 --> 02:18:10.093]  As a police, you'll end up dying.
[02:18:10.553 --> 02:18:19.175]  Your police stations will be burned down or you'll run to other countries because you didn't have the guts, like our border patrol, to stand up.
[02:18:19.515 --> 02:18:21.216]  If the invaders win, you're gonna die.
[02:18:21.996 --> 02:18:27.358]  You're going to die or you're going to leave at some point and abandon everything that you've ever had in those countries.
[02:18:27.598 --> 02:18:31.399]  If the patriots win, you will never be forgotten.
[02:18:31.559 --> 02:18:35.821]  Your children will not be forgotten for your cowardice, for not standing up.
[02:18:36.401 --> 02:18:37.021]  Bottom line.
[02:18:37.421 --> 02:18:39.562]  And cowards are natural traitors.
[02:18:39.962 --> 02:18:42.463]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[02:18:42.943 --> 02:18:43.803]  Nitric boost.
[02:18:44.743 --> 02:18:45.244]  Turmeric 95.
[02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:50.390]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[02:18:51.371 --> 02:18:56.333]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[02:18:56.833 --> 02:19:03.996]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[02:19:04.536 --> 02:19:06.537]  They let us private label their products.
[02:19:06.557 --> 02:19:07.438]  That's why you've already heard of
[02:19:08.298 --> 02:19:09.339]  Body's Old Turmeric Formula?
[02:19:09.659 --> 02:19:12.420]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[02:19:12.661 --> 02:19:13.981]  This is just their brand of that.
[02:19:14.322 --> 02:19:17.243]  And so, it is available under Turmeric 95.
[02:19:18.004 --> 02:19:18.624]  That's the name.
[02:19:18.884 --> 02:19:25.348]  So, we're sold out of Body's, but we have Turmeric 95 that is, again, the same concentrated turmeric.
[02:19:25.588 --> 02:19:26.628]  Same thing with Nitric Boost.
[02:19:27.089 --> 02:19:28.709]  Nitric Boost came from this company.
[02:19:28.749 --> 02:19:30.751]  They even let us use their name.
[02:19:31.031 --> 02:19:32.031]  It's now our best seller.
[02:19:32.251 --> 02:19:33.252]  We sold out of our version.
[02:19:33.512 --> 02:19:34.953]  Their version has a white bottle.
[02:19:35.293 --> 02:19:36.654]  It's the exact same thing.
[02:19:37.214 --> 02:19:38.757]  You get it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:39.038 --> 02:19:41.502]  So check out InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:42.898 --> 02:19:44.979]  The InfoWars system is very simple.
[02:19:45.179 --> 02:19:49.741]  We tell you the truth about what's going on in the world, and we ask that you support us in exchange.
[02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:52.782]  If we don't tell you the truth, you probably won't support us.
[02:19:53.122 --> 02:19:54.323]  That's our only incentive.
[02:19:54.463 --> 02:19:56.964]  All we have is you, the InfoWars audience.
[02:19:57.504 --> 02:20:05.448]  And just like our information has to be good, or else we can't expect your support, well, our products have to be good, or we can't expect you to be returning customers.
[02:20:05.488 --> 02:20:09.330]  And everybody knows some of the bombshell, incredible, iconic
[02:20:10.510 --> 02:20:11.251]  We're good to go.
[02:20:34.833 --> 02:20:46.862]  We can now project the winner of the presidential race.
[02:20:46.982 --> 02:20:49.163]  Donald Trump wins the presidency.
[02:20:49.323 --> 02:20:54.407]  What started off as unlikely, impossible, is now reality.
[02:20:56.849 --> 02:21:00.732]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body,
[02:21:01.548 --> 02:21:04.850]  And I will never, ever let you down.
[02:21:31.408 --> 02:21:31.988]  It's been years.
[02:21:32.009 --> 02:21:32.949]  They hated him.
[02:21:33.109 --> 02:21:34.130]  They targeted him.
[02:21:34.250 --> 02:21:35.211]  They hunted him.
[02:21:35.231 --> 02:21:39.755]  This is the epitome of the abuse of the prosecutorial power to preempt political decisions.
[02:21:40.115 --> 02:21:44.119]  I never thought anything like this could happen in America.
[02:21:44.820 --> 02:21:51.465]  The only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it.
[02:21:51.585 --> 02:21:58.892]  The more that a broken system tells you that you're wrong, the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead.
[02:21:59.492 --> 02:22:03.936]  They want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom.
[02:22:05.978 --> 02:22:10.522]  They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you.
[02:22:13.145 --> 02:22:19.771]  They're not coming after me, they're coming after you and I just happen to be standing in their way and I will never be moving.
[02:22:20.874 --> 02:22:24.877]  On November 5th, 2024, justice will be done.
[02:22:25.097 --> 02:22:31.062]  We will take back our country and we will make America great again.
[02:22:32.863 --> 02:22:37.547]  America will always rise to every challenge and overcome every danger.
[02:22:38.207 --> 02:22:42.170]  Donald Trump seems to always get stronger when challenged.
[02:22:42.550 --> 02:22:44.852]  These types of things, I think, give him strength.
[02:22:46.313 --> 02:22:49.916]  When I'm re-elected, I will totally obliterate the deep state.
[02:22:53.676 --> 02:23:06.226]  As long as we have pride in our beliefs, courage in our convictions, and faith in our God, then we will not fail.
[02:23:14.453 --> 02:23:19.277]  Alright, I talked about a lot of gloom and doom last segment because that's the possibility we're living in.
[02:23:19.297 --> 02:23:20.678]  Have you ever been driving in Colorado?
[02:23:22.059 --> 02:23:28.640]  Or other mountain states, you want to go to the top of a mountain, and you're like, wow, I can't believe this road's even open, but that's freedom.
[02:23:29.460 --> 02:23:41.943]  And there's a two-lane road, sometimes a one-lane road, because it goes up one way and comes down another, and you're literally one foot off a 3,000, 2,000, 4,000, 5,000-foot chasm.
[02:23:44.163 --> 02:23:48.164]  And you're really focused, and the kids are in the back of the car, you know, in their
[02:23:50.060 --> 02:23:56.061]  I remember taking my kids when they were little once to Colorado, and we were going to this place for one of those, and I was like, my God, they didn't tell me.
[02:23:56.101 --> 02:23:58.742]  I was like, literally, the drive was just like, that's one foot, we're dead.
[02:23:58.762 --> 02:24:00.002]  I was just totally focused.
[02:24:01.882 --> 02:24:02.582]  And it's the same thing.
[02:24:02.802 --> 02:24:04.043]  I mean, that's how I feel right now.
[02:24:04.303 --> 02:24:05.423]  Like, this is not a game.
[02:24:06.043 --> 02:24:07.123]  It's not a frickin' joke.
[02:24:08.143 --> 02:24:10.624]  And I'm not mad at people that want to go to Topgolf.
[02:24:10.944 --> 02:24:11.544]  I like going there.
[02:24:11.944 --> 02:24:13.204]  Or people that want to go to a movie.
[02:24:13.364 --> 02:24:13.724]  I love it.
[02:24:14.205 --> 02:24:15.465]  Or people that want to go deep-sea fishing.
[02:24:15.585 --> 02:24:16.005]  I get it.
[02:24:17.028 --> 02:24:20.790]  But really, if we were going to turn this around, the golf courses would be empty.
[02:24:21.211 --> 02:24:35.019]  Not because they did a lockdown, they wanted to make us stay in our houses and brainwash us, but because people independently were so politically and culturally and spiritually and financially engaged, that you couldn't get them to go out and play golf.
[02:24:36.040 --> 02:24:38.041]  You couldn't get them to go out and see a rock concert.
[02:24:39.722 --> 02:24:43.084]  And I'm not even saying those things are bad, I'm just saying, if China
[02:24:44.736 --> 02:24:46.978]  Invaded over the southern border with a million troops next week.
[02:24:47.018 --> 02:24:48.218]  Hypothetically, I'm not saying that's happening.
[02:24:49.740 --> 02:24:56.064]  Would you, as Chinese troops, two weeks into it, took San Antonio?
[02:24:57.825 --> 02:25:01.748]  In San Antonio, military bases are on fire, and they're using tactical nuclear weapons.
[02:25:01.768 --> 02:25:08.232]  Would you say, oh, well, they're using nuclear weapons, and they just invaded, you know, San Antonio, and they're, you know, an hour from Austin.
[02:25:09.933 --> 02:25:12.095]  Let's go to the bar and have some drinks.
[02:25:15.356 --> 02:25:18.378]  I always saw those old movies, it was a Hollywood thing they did, it was spiritual.
[02:25:18.398 --> 02:25:19.558]  I didn't understand it when I was a kid.
[02:25:19.899 --> 02:25:29.784]  How many movies and TV shows did you see, when it's the end of the world, and the world's gonna end in 10 minutes, and everybody decides to have sex?
[02:25:36.488 --> 02:25:40.831]  No, you decide to get on your knees and make sure you found God before you were about to die.
[02:25:41.943 --> 02:25:46.205]  I'll assure you, somebody about to be executed on, you know, death row in five minutes doesn't want to have sex.
[02:25:48.386 --> 02:25:53.109]  And I only throw that out there because they totally screw up all of our priorities, folks.
[02:25:54.049 --> 02:26:09.157]  And if Trump got in and we fully got behind him and the bureaucracy could be removed at least 10 deep, there's a very good chance we could turn this around.
[02:26:09.197 --> 02:26:11.078]  And that's what makes this so frustrating is
[02:26:13.536 --> 02:26:18.098]  The stakes are so high, and I can't believe we're even having to debate this with people.
[02:26:19.139 --> 02:26:23.300]  I mean, you go to a Democrat event, not just this year, but I've been going to them for 30 years.
[02:26:23.681 --> 02:26:23.921]  Really, 35.
[02:26:24.441 --> 02:26:27.562]  I've been going to Democrat Party events for 35 years.
[02:26:27.802 --> 02:26:28.163]  At least 35.
[02:26:28.463 --> 02:26:30.284]  About five years before I got on air.
[02:26:31.024 --> 02:26:33.945]  I was going to Democrat Party events when I was like 15, just to see what they were like.
[02:26:34.225 --> 02:26:34.646]  Checking them out.
[02:26:35.166 --> 02:26:35.826]  And Republican events.
[02:26:36.226 --> 02:26:41.549]  Hell, earlier than that, but going, you know, really to focus by the time I was 15, 16.
[02:26:44.173 --> 02:26:46.255]  And I remember back then, like, what's wrong with these people?
[02:26:46.275 --> 02:26:48.397]  They're like mental patients, but they wasn't that bad.
[02:26:48.917 --> 02:26:50.518]  And then, you know, 10 years ago, it was really bad.
[02:26:50.579 --> 02:26:54.842]  And now, you go to one and it's, I mean, it's like, what did they do to these people?
[02:26:57.244 --> 02:26:58.285]  What did they do to these people?
[02:27:00.767 --> 02:27:03.249]  And I just know this, I don't ever want to be like them.
[02:27:04.290 --> 02:27:05.811]  And I don't sit back and feel superior.
[02:27:06.052 --> 02:27:06.972]  Hey, look at these idiots.
[02:27:07.032 --> 02:27:08.614]  I go, man, what happened to our people?
[02:27:11.836 --> 02:27:12.277]  Oh, God.
[02:27:20.717 --> 02:27:23.858]  How many times did I say Trump's plane's gonna have an emergency?
[02:27:23.878 --> 02:27:30.260]  And they'll do it where it's not as obvious, make an engine go out, see his plane coming in all the side, one engine.
[02:27:33.761 --> 02:27:34.982]  And they go, oh, it's an old plane.
[02:27:35.002 --> 02:27:37.262]  Everybody knows old planes that are run right are the best.
[02:27:42.624 --> 02:27:44.525]  Never has problems, magically did, folks.
[02:27:45.805 --> 02:27:46.205]  It's on.
[02:27:47.546 --> 02:27:47.846]  It's on.
[02:27:49.130 --> 02:28:00.315]  And I don't want to be sitting here in two weeks when Trump's been shot dead or dies of a heart attack from poison, or his plane blows up, and everybody's like, oh my god, Alex Jones is around again!
[02:28:00.375 --> 02:28:02.556]  Like it's some type of entertainment form.
[02:28:02.936 --> 02:28:11.459]  And I know most of you aren't like that, but I am physically sick right now because I know how high the stakes are.
[02:28:13.700 --> 02:28:15.181]  And I know we're about to lose civilization.
[02:28:17.532 --> 02:28:20.713]  And I don't want to be in a Mad Max situation.
[02:28:20.833 --> 02:28:23.114]  I don't want... I mean, I'll have a leg up.
[02:28:23.375 --> 02:28:24.215]  So are our listeners.
[02:28:24.355 --> 02:28:25.175]  We know what's going on.
[02:28:25.896 --> 02:28:31.378]  We can skin bucks, run trot lines, use a gun, got basic supplies, kick ass if need be.
[02:28:31.738 --> 02:28:32.699]  But I'm not looking for that.
[02:28:33.119 --> 02:28:34.219]  I'm not looking to prove anything.
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:38.601]  It's like that... Who song?
[02:28:40.622 --> 02:28:42.263]  I don't have to fight to prove I'm right.
[02:28:47.742 --> 02:28:48.663]  But they're going to make us fight.
[02:28:51.285 --> 02:28:54.387]  And the problem is the people we'll face in this fight have no idea what's even going on.
[02:28:54.667 --> 02:28:56.088]  You're like killing NPCs.
[02:28:57.309 --> 02:29:01.232]  So every NPC in a civil war that's got to be killed is a loss.
[02:29:02.473 --> 02:29:07.136]  Is a failure of us when we had a chance to turn this around peacefully not doing it.
[02:29:15.182 --> 02:29:15.803]  I just know this.
[02:29:17.611 --> 02:29:24.053]  The Jamie Raskins, and the Barack Obamas, and the Chuckie Schumers.
[02:29:25.754 --> 02:29:44.381]  And the Clintons and the Zuckerbergs and all of them that are licking their lips and laughing and mud from the CIA on TV about how much they can't wait to come after MAGA and how much they can't wait to kick in Midwesterners' doors and Southerners' doors and people out West's hard-working doors.
[02:29:45.201 --> 02:29:48.142]  And it's like, listen, you people ain't worth nothing to us.
[02:29:48.202 --> 02:29:49.703]  We ain't looking for a fight with you.
[02:29:53.544 --> 02:29:55.606]  But if you look for the fight, you came to the right place.
[02:29:55.766 --> 02:29:56.607]  And I feel sorry for you.
[02:29:58.768 --> 02:30:00.330]  And we're sorry you fell to evil.
[02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:04.573]  But once you're demonically controlled, you have less value than dog manure.
[02:30:04.593 --> 02:30:07.335]  And I don't want to get my shoes dirty on you.
[02:30:07.616 --> 02:30:08.456]  I wish you didn't exist.
[02:30:09.277 --> 02:30:13.581]  I wish you had some other evil country you ran where you could just run around like North Korea and have fun with yourselves all day long.
[02:30:14.802 --> 02:30:15.482]  But you know what?
[02:30:15.762 --> 02:30:16.543]  You're in our grill.
[02:30:18.144 --> 02:30:18.965]  Never stop pushing.
[02:30:20.106 --> 02:30:20.947]  Never stop prodding.
[02:30:21.007 --> 02:30:22.008]  Never stop all your BS.
[02:30:24.264 --> 02:30:26.726]  And I'm just sitting back waiting for their false flags to blame on us.
[02:30:27.666 --> 02:30:30.908]  For them to cut the power, cyber attacks, all the crap they're going to pull.
[02:30:33.490 --> 02:30:35.751]  And we're going to be under judgment, all of us, including the evil.
[02:30:36.912 --> 02:30:44.677]  And the wicked ones are going to really freak out when this all goes down, that they're going to be the first ones, but at the hands of their own masters, that will be destroyed.
[02:30:46.878 --> 02:30:49.680]  Those of you that serve this evil, can't you see where it's going?
[02:30:49.960 --> 02:30:51.081]  Total oblivion.
[02:30:51.901 --> 02:30:53.002]  Total destruction.
[02:30:54.619 --> 02:30:55.239]  But you can't.
[02:30:56.600 --> 02:31:02.962]  Because you resonate with this twisted, demonic spirit, and you get a thrill out of the evil.
[02:31:04.603 --> 02:31:06.984]  So I've already committed myself into Christ's hands.
[02:31:07.904 --> 02:31:14.067]  And I have no backup plan, I have no backup broadcast, I have no anything except this show trying to stop them.
[02:31:14.287 --> 02:31:17.648]  I didn't spend time on other projects to cover my ass.
[02:31:18.008 --> 02:31:21.870]  I spent all of my time on this operation to try to stop these people.
[02:31:25.168 --> 02:31:26.409]  And we have a good chance of beating him.
[02:31:26.429 --> 02:31:30.593]  That's what makes it so sickening is I'd say it's 50-50 right now.
[02:31:32.474 --> 02:31:38.259]  And if people don't take this deadly, deadly, because we're not just talking about our own physical deaths.
[02:31:38.279 --> 02:31:42.883]  We're talking about the death of civilization and the human project and letting pure evil take over.
[02:31:43.323 --> 02:31:45.465]  And if people don't realize how awesome
[02:31:47.028 --> 02:31:49.489]  And how intense the stakes are.
[02:31:49.509 --> 02:31:55.550]  I just, I feel like I'm at the edge of a 10,000 foot cliff right now and we're all leaning over the edge of it.
[02:31:55.610 --> 02:31:57.471]  I'm like, can we just walk away from this right now?
[02:31:58.131 --> 02:32:07.653]  And then I look at the giggling and chortling and goblin-like behavior of the bad guys and how they are completely just on a craven power trip.
[02:32:10.234 --> 02:32:11.034]  And I asked myself,
[02:32:14.875 --> 02:32:16.777]  Forgive them, Father, they don't know what they do.
[02:32:18.858 --> 02:32:20.240]  And that's really what this is.
[02:32:22.281 --> 02:32:31.909]  But the fact that those of us with the know-how, some are black, some are white, some are old, some are young, some are Jewish, some are Catholic, some are Protestant, some are Buddhist, some are agnostic, there are good people of every group out there.
[02:32:33.150 --> 02:32:43.179]  But the fact that the leaders of us have let these people and their minions in control, I'm gonna tell you, just like he says in V for Vendetta, maybe you guys can find that part of the speech.
[02:32:45.421 --> 02:32:46.041]  Viva Vendetta.
[02:32:46.181 --> 02:32:47.161]  I know why you did it.
[02:32:47.241 --> 02:32:47.902]  I'm not pulling up.
[02:32:47.962 --> 02:32:48.822]  Viva Vendetta speech.
[02:32:49.902 --> 02:32:52.263]  You were afraid, and who would blame you?
[02:32:53.663 --> 02:32:57.084]  But if you want to know who's really guilty at the end of the day, you only look in the mirror.
[02:32:58.224 --> 02:33:02.125]  Yes, there are those that are more responsible, and they will be held accountable.
[02:33:04.226 --> 02:33:07.747]  But in the end, if you want to know who's guilty, you only need to look in the mirror.
[02:33:12.355 --> 02:33:15.738]  If you look at the escalation curve, it's going straight up now.
[02:33:17.540 --> 02:33:22.685]  So if you think we're in a crisis now, the next month will create crises bigger than the last year combined.
[02:33:23.525 --> 02:33:27.249]  And then the next month after that, bigger crises in the last five years combined.
[02:33:27.589 --> 02:33:33.795]  And then the next month, bigger crises in the last decade combined, until boom, nuclear war, or bioweapon release, or both.
[02:33:35.595 --> 02:33:44.983]  It's like the cartoon where the, you know, cartoon character has like 20 plates and saucers and cups and they're trying to keep it balanced and they slip and it all comes down.
[02:33:45.343 --> 02:33:50.328]  And we're right at that point now and I'm just like, no, no, no!
[02:33:51.789 --> 02:33:55.072]  A lot of folks are online like, let it all go down, let's get it going.
[02:33:55.252 --> 02:33:57.414]  Yeah, that'll be fun the first day or two your power's out.
[02:34:01.684 --> 02:34:07.908]  And then you're running out of food a month later, and people are breaking in your house every day, and fires are coming down the street, and now your house burns out.
[02:34:08.689 --> 02:34:15.493]  And now you're running around the street, maybe you're in your truck, you're almost out of gas, there's barricades everywhere, get shot in your truck, you're dead.
[02:34:15.513 --> 02:34:17.074]  It's not gonna be nice.
[02:34:20.296 --> 02:34:24.158]  Or let's say six months into it, you're out 100 miles in the middle of nowhere.
[02:34:27.220 --> 02:34:30.322]  And the neighbors show up and say, we're out of food, we need food.
[02:34:31.820 --> 02:34:34.062]  He said, we only have enough food for ourselves here, we can't do that.
[02:34:34.082 --> 02:34:38.706]  A week later, they come back with 10 trucks and they say, you're gonna give us half your food or we're gonna burn you out.
[02:34:41.068 --> 02:34:42.029]  Maybe you give them your food.
[02:34:42.049 --> 02:34:46.353]  And then a month later, they come back to kill you to eat your ass.
[02:34:47.654 --> 02:34:48.515]  That's how this works.
[02:34:49.075 --> 02:34:53.519]  I know to the average cutesy out there, I make the whole eat your ass thing, warning people years ago where this was going.
[02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:55.461]  Cutting off world food supply.
[02:34:55.681 --> 02:34:56.882]  Oh, that's just Jones being funny.
[02:34:57.082 --> 02:34:58.964]  No, I was telling you where this is going.
[02:35:03.683 --> 02:35:06.425]  So you can go out in the countryside and wait for somebody to try to come eat you.
[02:35:12.128 --> 02:35:21.433]  Or, you can get politically involved now, like your life depends on it, and pray to God 50 times a day to turn this around, and God will do it, just like he protected President Trump.
[02:35:22.493 --> 02:35:32.599]  But if you don't wake up now, you're gonna be in Viggo Mortensen's The Road along almost every timeline.
[02:35:36.991 --> 02:35:39.091]  People that live in America for so long, they go, oh, that'll never happen.
[02:35:39.332 --> 02:35:43.072]  You know, they've had stuff that happens like in that best-selling book that's a fiction novel?
[02:35:44.533 --> 02:35:46.213]  Hundreds of times in the last century around the world.
[02:35:47.073 --> 02:35:47.733]  That's what happens.
[02:35:48.914 --> 02:35:58.816]  And we had great founders and great people that wanted to build something better, who've been in war since the day they were born.
[02:35:59.996 --> 02:36:04.737]  And they gave us this thing that became so great, and now it's overrun by corruption.
[02:36:10.071 --> 02:36:19.135]  After they signed the Constitution years after the war, it took them, what, 1798 to get it done?
[02:36:19.155 --> 02:36:21.176]  Or was it 88?
[02:36:21.296 --> 02:36:22.197]  I forget.
[02:36:22.977 --> 02:36:24.578]  When was the Constitution finally ratified?
[02:36:25.538 --> 02:36:26.639]  I can't keep track of it anymore.
[02:36:26.659 --> 02:36:27.559]  Was it 1788 or 98?
[02:36:27.599 --> 02:36:28.099]  Whatever, look it up, 89?
[02:36:28.159 --> 02:36:28.099]  1789?
[02:36:28.179 --> 02:36:28.960]  1789, yeah, look it up for me.
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:29.900]  But the point is, 1788, okay.
[02:36:40.006 --> 02:36:45.048]  Is that Benjamin Franklin came out of there and a lady said, a newspaper writer said, What do we have?
[02:36:45.068 --> 02:36:47.109]  And he says, a republic if you can keep it.
[02:36:49.630 --> 02:36:51.211]  Yeah, they've got the V for Vendetta Club.
[02:36:54.052 --> 02:36:54.813]  But see, here's the deal.
[02:36:56.293 --> 02:36:58.394]  This isn't me breaking down on the air.
[02:36:58.434 --> 02:36:59.595]  This is me being who I really am.
[02:37:01.468 --> 02:37:02.190]  I need people.
[02:37:02.550 --> 02:37:03.612]  I don't mean our regular audience.
[02:37:03.632 --> 02:37:04.414]  I know you're already awake.
[02:37:04.494 --> 02:37:06.077]  I'm talking about all the new listeners, millions a day.
[02:37:06.598 --> 02:37:07.901]  They're tuning in like, oh, what's the novelty?
[02:37:07.941 --> 02:37:09.083]  What's this Alex Jones thing about?
[02:37:09.324 --> 02:37:10.606]  You're going to find out what it's all about.
[02:37:12.264 --> 02:37:14.686]  You're going to remember in your head later, I warned you about this.
[02:37:15.106 --> 02:37:17.828]  I want you to sit back later and go, oh that guy was wrong.
[02:37:18.208 --> 02:37:19.749]  That stuff didn't happen like he said.
[02:37:20.290 --> 02:37:21.611]  But you notice it keeps happening.
[02:37:21.991 --> 02:37:27.875]  And I guarantee you, the civilization you see around you isn't going to be here in a couple years down this road.
[02:37:28.576 --> 02:37:31.218]  Like when Jesus Christ, I'm going to compare myself to him, it's just an allegory.
[02:37:32.406 --> 02:37:40.008]  Pointed at the temple and at Jerusalem, and he said, before your generation is done, there will not be one stone standing on top of another.
[02:37:40.588 --> 02:37:42.809]  That temple and everything around it will be destroyed.
[02:37:43.269 --> 02:37:49.791]  And 70 years to the day, the Roman General Titus destroyed it all.
[02:37:56.992 --> 02:37:58.333]  But you're not gonna have to wait 70 years.
[02:38:00.267 --> 02:38:02.248]  The Russian nuclear subs are off our coast.
[02:38:02.629 --> 02:38:04.290]  Our supposed subs are off their coast.
[02:38:05.471 --> 02:38:08.113]  Six months ago, Posobiec said they've hired this terrorism head.
[02:38:08.313 --> 02:38:12.136]  They're gonna start attacks inside Russia, not with drones, but ground troops and terrorism.
[02:38:12.156 --> 02:38:15.098]  And now they launched a huge attack into Russia and all hell's broke loose.
[02:38:15.498 --> 02:38:16.058]  And the U.S.
[02:38:16.118 --> 02:38:18.240]  is moving heavy weapons up to the border with Russia.
[02:38:18.340 --> 02:38:19.261]  It's on, folks.
[02:38:19.561 --> 02:38:20.441]  Crazy town.
[02:38:20.742 --> 02:38:24.044]  Never happened since World War II.
[02:38:25.465 --> 02:38:26.526]  Total insanity.
[02:38:32.719 --> 02:38:33.380]  We forgot God.
[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:35.601]  We took God out of schools.
[02:38:36.241 --> 02:38:37.142]  We don't need God.
[02:38:37.242 --> 02:38:38.623]  We can figure it out ourselves.
[02:38:39.103 --> 02:38:40.084]  Yeah, you're about to find out.
[02:38:42.646 --> 02:38:46.008]  You may not believe Sodom and Gomorrah got destroyed from the air by fire.
[02:38:46.969 --> 02:38:47.769]  God blew it up.
[02:38:49.490 --> 02:38:50.531]  We got that power now, don't we?
[02:38:56.024 --> 02:39:04.898]  You don't have to believe Atlantis existed and had some secret power technology and a white light energy generator that blew up and blew the whole island up, but we got that power now.
[02:39:05.479 --> 02:39:07.381]  See, funny all those things we heard about.
[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:09.540]  That didn't exist.
[02:39:09.580 --> 02:39:10.761]  They were just fantasy.
[02:39:11.081 --> 02:39:12.221]  Now we got all of it.
[02:39:12.281 --> 02:39:13.301]  Have you noticed that?
[02:39:13.722 --> 02:39:20.784]  Oh, a world government with a cashless society that tracks everything you do and you gotta follow its every order and worship it or you can't buy or sell.
[02:39:20.964 --> 02:39:22.484]  You don't just agree to take the mark.
[02:39:22.724 --> 02:39:23.965]  You gotta worship it.
[02:39:24.405 --> 02:39:25.725]  You gotta bend your knee.
[02:39:25.985 --> 02:39:27.746]  You gotta get on your belly to it.
[02:39:28.426 --> 02:39:32.047]  Gee, how John of the Isle of Patmos, what a science fiction writer he is.
[02:39:32.327 --> 02:39:34.848]  He just came up with, no, an angel came and told him.
[02:39:37.287 --> 02:39:38.568]  Instead, you're about to get the revelation.
[02:39:38.588 --> 02:39:39.249]  Do you accept it?
[02:39:39.609 --> 02:39:40.370]  Yeah, I accept it.
[02:39:40.450 --> 02:39:40.890]  Bam!
[02:39:42.271 --> 02:39:43.432]  Here's a revelation for you.
[02:39:44.553 --> 02:39:50.078]  Because God loves us and he gave us free will, but he also gave us a navigational guide, a cheat sheet, if you will.
[02:39:50.098 --> 02:39:52.800]  I hate to use the word cheat, but you know what I mean.
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:54.301]  An owner's manual.
[02:39:55.582 --> 02:39:57.164]  Like giving your 10-year-old a shotgun.
[02:39:57.284 --> 02:39:58.625]  Son, read the owner's manual.
[02:39:58.785 --> 02:39:59.886]  I'll give you some safety training.
[02:40:00.847 --> 02:40:03.549]  You got free will with that shotgun, but daddy taught you how to use it.
[02:40:06.994 --> 02:40:07.514]  This is it.
[02:40:09.796 --> 02:40:12.577]  This is the beginning of the big time.
[02:40:13.498 --> 02:40:15.559]  We ain't living in the slow time.
[02:40:15.879 --> 02:40:19.802]  We ain't living in the old days, the good old days, the good old times.
[02:40:21.443 --> 02:40:23.003]  We're living inside the New World Order.
[02:40:26.085 --> 02:40:31.989]  And if you think them killing 35 million people with those shots was bad, that was just a test.
[02:40:35.131 --> 02:40:38.032]  So count your lucky stars that you're awake if you're tuned in.
[02:40:39.913 --> 02:40:44.374]  Because I sure as hell wouldn't be the people that don't even understand this stuff.
[02:40:46.135 --> 02:40:47.255]  Here's the clip from Viva Vendetta.
[02:40:48.135 --> 02:40:56.858]  For God's sake, don't touch it!
[02:40:56.879 --> 02:40:58.059]  Dad, what's wrong with the telly?
[02:41:15.213 --> 02:41:17.254]  Good evening, London.
[02:41:17.354 --> 02:41:18.715]  Allow me first to apologize.
[02:41:19.075 --> 02:41:20.256]  This is the emergency channel!
[02:41:20.716 --> 02:41:24.538]  I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of the everyday routine.
[02:41:24.799 --> 02:41:26.500]  The security of the familiar.
[02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:27.921]  The tranquility.
[02:41:28.041 --> 02:41:28.741]  Repetition.
[02:41:29.041 --> 02:41:30.142]  Not here.
[02:41:30.302 --> 02:41:30.903]  Who's that, Mum?
[02:41:54.226 --> 02:41:57.008]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[02:41:57.228 --> 02:41:57.608]  We think.
[02:41:57.648 --> 02:41:58.528]  Just let me think.
[02:41:58.568 --> 02:42:03.771]  Even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[02:42:03.791 --> 02:42:05.232]  It's Chancellor Suttler.
[02:42:05.252 --> 02:42:05.732]  Damn it!
[02:42:05.812 --> 02:42:06.152]  Why?
[02:42:06.893 --> 02:42:12.896]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[02:42:13.476 --> 02:42:16.618]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:24.204]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[02:42:24.244 --> 02:42:25.224]  You designed it, sir.
[02:42:25.284 --> 02:42:26.185]  You wanted it foolproof.
[02:42:26.225 --> 02:42:27.626]  You told me every television in London!
[02:42:27.866 --> 02:42:29.948]  Cruelty and injustice.
[02:42:29.968 --> 02:42:31.249]  Intolerance and oppression.
[02:42:31.769 --> 02:42:40.016]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity
[02:42:42.622 --> 02:42:43.383]  How did this happen?
[02:42:44.064 --> 02:42:44.886]  Who's to blame?
[02:42:45.787 --> 02:42:48.451]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[02:42:48.471 --> 02:42:50.434]  They will be held accountable.
[02:42:50.454 --> 02:42:56.283]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[02:42:57.466 --> 02:42:59.348]  I know why you did it.
[02:42:59.449 --> 02:43:00.530]  I know you were afraid.
[02:43:00.970 --> 02:43:01.651]  Who wouldn't be?
[02:43:02.192 --> 02:43:02.613]  War?
[02:43:02.933 --> 02:43:03.313]  Terror?
[02:43:03.574 --> 02:43:04.235]  Disease?
[02:43:04.875 --> 02:43:10.763]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[02:43:11.303 --> 02:43:12.625]  Fear got the best of you.
[02:43:13.125 --> 02:43:17.070]  And in your panic, you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[02:43:17.691 --> 02:43:23.877]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[02:43:23.978 --> 02:43:25.219]  Inspector, you're almost through.
[02:43:25.319 --> 02:43:27.562]  Last night, I sought to end that silence.
[02:43:28.142 --> 02:43:32.908]  Last night, I destroyed the old Bailey to remind this country of what it has forgotten.
[02:43:34.733 --> 02:43:40.557]  More than 400 years ago, a great citizen wished to embed the 5th of November forever in our memory.
[02:43:41.237 --> 02:43:46.141]  His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words.
[02:43:46.821 --> 02:43:48.462]  They are perspectives.
[02:43:49.063 --> 02:43:58.589]  So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you, then I would suggest that you allow the 5th of November to pass unmarked.
[02:43:59.525 --> 02:44:19.797]  But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a 5th of November that shall never, ever be forgotten.
[02:44:20.538 --> 02:44:25.981]  We want to do this peacefully, but we can't do it by trying to affect the outside world.
[02:44:26.021 --> 02:44:27.382]  That comes secondarily, like the
[02:44:28.652 --> 02:44:31.653]  Headwaters and into the creeks and into the rivers out of the ocean.
[02:44:32.194 --> 02:44:36.216]  We have to make the change with God ourselves and I'm not up here preaching.
[02:44:36.676 --> 02:44:37.836]  I'm not up here as a holy man.
[02:44:37.876 --> 02:44:42.178]  I'm not up here with all the answers, but I know this God's real and God's on the throne and God's in control.
[02:44:42.198 --> 02:44:44.960]  All right, there's a lot of news I didn't hit.
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:49.602]  We got a big guest coming up and I'll be up here tonight during the Elon Musk Trump thing.
[02:44:49.622 --> 02:44:55.845]  We'll have live coverage of that continually at RealAlexJones on X and Infowars.com forward slash show and stations want to pick it up around the country.
[02:44:57.132 --> 02:45:01.234]  Uh, and I'll be doing an X-Spaces with Mariano Fall and a bunch of other people tonight.
[02:45:02.795 --> 02:45:09.659]  A bunch of other big guests, but, uh, I mean, look at how that's a movie about tyranny in the UK, and now look how they want to arrest Elon Musk.
[02:45:10.299 --> 02:45:11.580]  Anybody else that criticizes him.
[02:45:12.600 --> 02:45:14.941]  I mean, this is tyranny repeating, but not in a movie.
[02:45:15.622 --> 02:45:16.562]  In the real world.
[02:45:16.582 --> 02:45:17.943]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:45:18.342 --> 02:45:21.464]  We got a big announcement at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:45:55.816 --> 02:45:59.240]  If you're not getting any collagen in your system, this is a great way to do so.
[02:45:59.380 --> 02:46:00.961]  Ageless Vitality Collagen.
[02:46:01.682 --> 02:46:02.963]  Superfood greens.

[02:46:05.845 --> 02:46:08.447]  If you're not eating your vegetables, this is a great way to supplement that.
[02:46:08.567 --> 02:46:09.568]  Superfood greens.
[02:46:10.008 --> 02:46:10.929]  Mushroom Macs.
[02:46:11.049 --> 02:46:13.491]  All the great benefits of mushrooms.
[02:46:13.511 --> 02:46:14.512]  You might not like eating them.
[02:46:14.552 --> 02:46:17.674]  I'm not a big fan of them myself, but you can get it in a capsule.
[02:46:17.694 --> 02:46:19.736]  You don't have to worry about the nasty taste or texture.
[02:46:20.296 --> 02:46:21.196]  And get all the benefits.
[02:46:21.236 --> 02:46:26.077]  Mushroom Maxx, Better Mood Plus, Libido RX, Turmeric 95.
[02:46:26.278 --> 02:46:28.458]  Man, the benefits of turmeric are just incredible.
[02:46:28.818 --> 02:46:33.139]  When I'm not taking turmeric, I genuinely can notice the difference.
[02:46:33.199 --> 02:46:36.600]  It's one of those types of supplements where you just, you notice when you're not taking it.
[02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:43.862]  And for me, it's kind of the soreness and maybe some inflammation after a workout or if I play basketball for a couple hours the next day.
[02:46:45.323 --> 02:46:46.344]  I noticed the difference.
[02:46:46.705 --> 02:46:47.505]  I noticed the difference.
[02:46:47.546 --> 02:46:48.407]  And it's kind of sad.
[02:46:48.447 --> 02:46:50.369]  It reminds you you're not going to be young forever.
[02:46:50.689 --> 02:46:52.711]  But that's why Tumeric is so important.
[02:46:52.772 --> 02:46:53.632]  Tumeric 95, 25% off.
[02:46:53.673 --> 02:46:56.215]  The prebiotic formula.
[02:46:56.316 --> 02:46:57.497]  The prostate support.
[02:46:57.937 --> 02:46:59.039]  Very important for men.

[02:47:04.625 --> 02:47:07.366]  You know, if you're having trouble sleeping, a supplement always great for that.
[02:47:07.626 --> 02:47:08.306]  Good night's sleep.
[02:47:08.787 --> 02:47:14.569]  All of these, the InfoWars MD Premium Supplement line, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:47:14.649 --> 02:47:15.949]  We appreciate your support there.
[02:47:16.470 --> 02:47:18.230]  That's what makes everything we do here possible.
[02:47:30.708 --> 02:47:33.351]  I was wanting to come up with a turmeric formula, so I talked to some of the big suppliers.
[02:47:33.731 --> 02:47:35.893]  I said, what's the strongest curcuminoid you have?
[02:47:36.614 --> 02:47:37.715]  And they said it's like 75%.
[02:47:37.996 --> 02:47:42.060]  Regular turmeric's just raw, 4-5% still has a great effect.
[02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:44.863]  I said, but what's the strongest concentrate you can make?
[02:47:45.363 --> 02:47:46.664]  They came back a few months later and they said 95%.
[02:47:50.216 --> 02:47:50.676]  This is it.
[02:47:51.577 --> 02:47:53.117]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:47:53.377 --> 02:47:54.198]  Been sold out for months.
[02:47:54.618 --> 02:47:55.498]  Back in stock.
[02:47:55.759 --> 02:47:58.420]  It's 95% curcuminoid.
[02:47:58.980 --> 02:48:00.781]  And it does incredible things for your body.
[02:48:01.121 --> 02:48:02.562]  And my wife's a big sports person.
[02:48:02.862 --> 02:48:03.662]  She's in great shape.
[02:48:03.682 --> 02:48:04.863]  Plays tennis, lifts weights all day.
[02:48:05.203 --> 02:48:05.883]  But she has joint pain.
[02:48:06.363 --> 02:48:08.484]  And years ago, she would take these horse pills of turmeric.
[02:48:08.504 --> 02:48:10.205]  She'd take three or four, would give her relief.
[02:48:10.505 --> 02:48:11.266]  I said, try this.
[02:48:11.286 --> 02:48:11.886]  She looked to the back.
[02:48:11.906 --> 02:48:13.447]  She said, this is lower milligrams.
[02:48:14.227 --> 02:48:16.390]  I said, yeah, but that's because it's concentrate.
[02:48:16.911 --> 02:48:17.391]  She took it.
[02:48:17.431 --> 02:48:21.817]  She said one pill had the effect of the big four horse pills she was taking.
[02:48:22.378 --> 02:48:25.102]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, this is an amazing product.
[02:48:25.642 --> 02:48:27.925]  It's back in stock at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:48:28.206 --> 02:48:29.227]  And it's not just the 95% humanoid.
[02:48:30.789 --> 02:48:34.053]  It's organic spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme leaves.
[02:48:34.354 --> 02:48:35.555]  Pepparine from black pepper.
[02:48:35.976 --> 02:48:38.139]  So it's an amazing formula.
[02:48:38.679 --> 02:48:44.066]  It's exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com and it could be our last run.
[02:48:44.327 --> 02:48:47.110]  They're trying to shut us down and please don't take that for granted.
[02:48:47.932 --> 02:48:50.053]  We get shut down, people go, whoa, he wasn't BS-ing.

[02:49:22.342 --> 02:49:22.542]  Yep.
[02:49:23.083 --> 02:49:26.405]  Love being here and love everything that InfoWars is doing.
[02:49:27.726 --> 02:49:33.971]  And, uh, freedom, peace and justice, they're dirty words anymore.
[02:49:33.991 --> 02:49:37.434]  You're not allowed to say anything the government doesn't allow you to say.
[02:49:38.315 --> 02:49:39.856]  Look what happened to Scott Ritter.
[02:49:41.497 --> 02:49:41.697]  Yep.
[02:49:42.538 --> 02:49:43.339]  Man of peace.
[02:49:45.092 --> 02:49:46.513]  FBI busts him up.
[02:49:46.874 --> 02:49:48.675]  Look what happens to Alex Jones.
[02:49:50.196 --> 02:49:51.637]  A man of peace and freedom.
[02:49:53.039 --> 02:49:53.779]  Lock him down.
[02:49:53.879 --> 02:49:54.360]  Lock him up.
[02:49:54.740 --> 02:49:56.281]  Do anything you can to stop him.
[02:49:56.962 --> 02:49:58.663]  Again, I got death threats as well.
[02:50:00.925 --> 02:50:02.086]  Scott Ridd is a friend of mine.
[02:50:03.747 --> 02:50:05.889]  And people have no idea about this cat.
[02:50:06.049 --> 02:50:06.870]  He's a real man.
[02:50:07.310 --> 02:50:08.411]  He was on the other side.
[02:50:08.891 --> 02:50:10.733]  He was a top Marine, you know, the whole thing.
[02:50:12.702 --> 02:50:16.003]  He had the mentality to kill all the enemies.
[02:50:16.823 --> 02:50:23.004]  And then when he got on the other side, and his dad was in the military too, he realized this isn't the way to do it.
[02:50:23.044 --> 02:50:24.304]  We need peace, not war.
[02:50:26.205 --> 02:50:36.966]  This is the UN weapons inspector that had the proof, the proof, that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction.
[02:50:40.640 --> 02:50:42.341]  Biden, they all made fun of him.
[02:50:45.142 --> 02:50:51.905]  This is a guy that's against the Ukraine war wants peace, against the Israeli genocidal war wants peace.
[02:50:52.805 --> 02:50:54.686]  And yes, genocide by definition.
[02:50:54.726 --> 02:50:55.726]  Look up the definition.
[02:50:56.146 --> 02:51:01.089]  How many hundreds of people did they kill on Saturday and Sunday and Monday in schools?
[02:51:01.169 --> 02:51:02.729]  Oh yeah, Hamas was there.
[02:51:03.049 --> 02:51:06.511]  So we killed everybody in the school, but we got the Hamas's guys.
[02:51:07.714 --> 02:51:10.216]  Oh, and 3.5 billion dollars.
[02:51:10.396 --> 02:51:10.796]  Million.
[02:51:11.297 --> 02:51:13.058]  Billion.
[02:51:13.078 --> 02:51:19.083]  3.5 billion dollars of our money just went over there to Israel to keep slaughtering the people.
[02:51:20.644 --> 02:51:23.346]  As the country's rotting in front of our eyes.
[02:51:23.966 --> 02:51:25.327]  Rotting like crap!
[02:51:25.808 --> 02:51:30.031]  Because we got a bunch of crapsters running the show.
[02:51:30.051 --> 02:51:33.313]  I'm down in New York City.
[02:51:33.353 --> 02:51:34.274]  It's a slum.
[02:51:36.022 --> 02:51:37.764]  I'm a Bronx cat, got it?
[02:51:38.245 --> 02:51:39.145]  Know the city.
[02:51:39.866 --> 02:51:40.507]  Born there.
[02:51:42.469 --> 02:51:43.050]  Hung out.
[02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:44.051]  Played.
[02:51:44.631 --> 02:51:45.612]  Wild times.
[02:51:47.034 --> 02:51:51.038]  Now, people shooting up, drugged out.
[02:51:52.119 --> 02:51:55.142]  Or every scaffolding just about homeless people.
[02:51:55.543 --> 02:51:57.325]  And garbage all over the streets.
[02:51:58.414 --> 02:52:01.596]  And it's so much fun to drive down there.
[02:52:04.218 --> 02:52:05.518]  The rotted roads.
[02:52:05.778 --> 02:52:07.139]  The rotted bridges.
[02:52:07.459 --> 02:52:09.721]  The subways are night in Calcutta.
[02:52:10.201 --> 02:52:10.821]  Amtrak?
[02:52:11.182 --> 02:52:12.602]  How about Amcrap?
[02:52:13.303 --> 02:52:14.283]  I am crap!
[02:52:14.664 --> 02:52:23.289]  Oh, but don't forget to give the slimeball who's running that lousy piece of junk that's losing money a big bonus.
[02:52:24.580 --> 02:52:26.902]  That's the scum running our country.
[02:52:27.382 --> 02:52:30.644]  Oh, oh the people, I get these, oh we don't like your language.
[02:52:31.385 --> 02:52:32.445]  Grow the hell up!
[02:52:33.726 --> 02:52:38.470]  It's proper language when you say somebody, F you, don't tell me what to do.
[02:52:39.450 --> 02:52:46.295]  Which is why we have these t-shirts that you get at transjournal.com.
[02:52:46.475 --> 02:52:50.878]  Hey politicians, who the F are you to tell me what to do?
[02:52:51.378 --> 02:52:51.859]  You got it?
[02:52:52.479 --> 02:52:53.400]  Proper language.
[02:52:54.198 --> 02:52:57.560]  When your life is, oh no, Shalenti, you have to speak like Obama.
[02:52:58.021 --> 02:52:59.942]  The Nobel piece of crap prize winner.
[02:53:00.523 --> 02:53:00.863]  Folks.
[02:53:01.723 --> 02:53:02.064]  Folks.
[02:53:02.884 --> 02:53:03.224]  Folks.
[02:53:03.865 --> 02:53:04.946]  Always folking us.
[02:53:06.407 --> 02:53:08.328]  I want that guy Qaddafi outta there.
[02:53:08.628 --> 02:53:09.469]  Yep, there's the shorts.
[02:53:10.630 --> 02:53:15.073]  Can't get anything on, and this is the time for it, because you know me, I'm against the whole system.
[02:53:15.353 --> 02:53:16.254]  To me, it's all BS.
[02:53:17.134 --> 02:53:19.156]  Well, and I've been on the other side, to make it clear.
[02:53:20.257 --> 02:53:21.497]  So anyway, it's,
[02:53:22.964 --> 02:53:23.164]  St.
[02:53:23.204 --> 02:53:24.445]  Thomas Aquinas said it.
[02:53:27.006 --> 02:53:33.128]  If you're not angry, when it's morally justifiable to be angry, you are immoral.
[02:53:34.509 --> 02:53:41.252]  And you gotta support the truth and freedom, and that's why you need to stay on with InfoWars.
[02:53:41.872 --> 02:53:42.853]  Get their products.
[02:53:43.433 --> 02:53:46.134]  Support InfoWars because they're supporting you.
[02:53:47.262 --> 02:53:49.762]  And they're going to blacklist everybody they can.
[02:53:50.083 --> 02:53:50.763]  We'll be right back.
[02:53:51.083 --> 02:53:54.623]  Love being on the Alex Jones Show and InfoWars.
[02:53:55.483 --> 02:53:58.464]  Again, support InfoWars because they're supporting you.
[02:53:58.484 --> 02:54:02.985]  And again, if you want history before it happens, you want the Trends Journal.
[02:54:03.285 --> 02:54:03.985]  Want some proof?
[02:54:06.045 --> 02:54:09.286]  Apartments, hockey rinks, and Amazon warehouses.
[02:54:10.186 --> 02:54:16.227]  Macy's closures will set off a wave of change at shopping malls.
[02:54:17.054 --> 02:54:20.116]  This is one of the big stories right now on CNBC.
[02:54:22.038 --> 02:54:32.305]  Macy's will set off a wave of change in malls as it closes about 150 namesake stores across the country by early 2027.
[02:54:33.406 --> 02:54:43.853]  The BS that they're going to be able to convert these malls is like the same kind of crap that they're spewing out
[02:54:44.597 --> 02:54:53.805]  That with you have an office vacancy rate, ain't nobody there in New York City at over 23%.
[02:54:56.347 --> 02:55:00.130]  In San Francisco, when not only you left your heart.
[02:55:00.686 --> 02:55:06.209]  You left your mind and your soul because little Katsan Gavin Newsom, the daddy's boy.
[02:55:06.269 --> 02:55:08.411]  My daddy's a member of the Getty Gang.
[02:55:08.771 --> 02:55:10.692]  I got all my money from the Getty's.
[02:55:11.012 --> 02:55:12.953]  Oh, I'm so great at business.
[02:55:13.433 --> 02:55:15.114]  Oh, related to Pelosi.
[02:55:15.154 --> 02:55:16.655]  It's one big club and you ain't in it.
[02:55:16.975 --> 02:55:18.636]  Yeah, that guy that destroyed the place.
[02:55:19.597 --> 02:55:23.379]  The first state to lock down to fight the COVID war.
[02:55:24.360 --> 02:55:25.140]  34.5% vacancy rate.
[02:55:26.461 --> 02:55:26.741]  Vacant.
[02:55:27.001 --> 02:55:27.482]  Nobody there.
[02:55:28.242 --> 02:55:29.643]  Oh, a building in New York.
[02:55:30.348 --> 02:55:34.011]  On 50th Street, Midtown.
[02:55:34.031 --> 02:55:37.053]  2006, sold for $320 million.
[02:55:40.155 --> 02:55:43.958]  Week and a half ago, $8.5 million.
[02:55:44.358 --> 02:55:44.518]  Yeah.
[02:55:45.179 --> 02:55:46.240]  Let's go back to the malls.
[02:55:47.140 --> 02:55:52.584]  You can't, on the buildings, no, they're not convertible to housing.
[02:55:53.765 --> 02:55:59.109]  Like you take the one on 50th Street, who's in the middle of the block, ugly glass crap,
[02:56:02.720 --> 02:56:04.402]  You can't put rooms inside of it.
[02:56:05.443 --> 02:56:07.744]  You got rooms in the middle with no windows?
[02:56:09.126 --> 02:56:09.646]  Can't do it.
[02:56:10.667 --> 02:56:12.548]  You're better off knocking them down and rebuilding.
[02:56:12.648 --> 02:56:14.029]  Same thing's gonna happen with the malls.
[02:56:14.410 --> 02:56:18.173]  But again, this is why you subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[02:56:18.753 --> 02:56:20.975]  This is the best international best-selling book.
[02:56:22.256 --> 02:56:23.677]  My book, Trends 2000.
[02:56:23.777 --> 02:56:24.038]  You ready?
[02:56:30.168 --> 02:56:31.529]  We said this was going to happen.
[02:56:34.350 --> 02:56:35.070]  Right over here.
[02:56:35.850 --> 02:56:36.611]  Page 199.
[02:56:39.552 --> 02:56:41.232]  The poll on the mall.
[02:56:45.434 --> 02:56:46.535]  We said they were outdated.
[02:56:46.575 --> 02:56:47.315]  They had their time.
[02:56:48.775 --> 02:56:51.056]  And again, this is the beginning of the Internet Revolution.
[02:56:52.097 --> 02:56:54.578]  People weren't shopping like that, but we said they were going to.
[02:56:56.098 --> 02:56:57.399]  And it's just going to keep getting worse.
[02:56:58.487 --> 02:57:00.068]  So, did you see gold prices today?
[02:57:01.448 --> 02:57:01.908]  Let's see.
[02:57:03.089 --> 02:57:09.491]  When I went on the air, $2,470 an ounce.
[02:57:09.511 --> 02:57:15.052]  Hey, what's one of your top trends for 2024?
[02:57:16.593 --> 02:57:17.853]  A golden year for gold.
[02:57:20.114 --> 02:57:22.755]  How much has gold gone up since we made that forecast?
[02:57:25.416 --> 02:57:25.756]  Wow, $2,486!
[02:57:25.896 --> 02:57:27.358]  Woo!
[02:57:28.138 --> 02:57:40.768]  It was $2,041 when we made that trend forecast.
[02:57:41.629 --> 02:57:43.130]  So it's gone up what?
[02:57:43.150 --> 02:57:44.751]  $440-something bucks.
[02:57:46.793 --> 02:57:48.674]  That's why you subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[02:57:49.235 --> 02:57:54.419]  Because, again, why you subscribe is to stay with InfoWars, and you've got to support them.
[02:57:55.524 --> 02:57:58.186]  Is because you're getting nothing from the mainstream media.
[02:57:58.566 --> 02:57:58.786]  Yeah.
[02:58:01.027 --> 02:58:07.411]  I don't want to get censored so I can't say the proper word for the wall SHI with another letter in the journal.
[02:58:08.171 --> 02:58:08.392]  Right?
[02:58:09.892 --> 02:58:10.533]  Look at this picture.
[02:58:12.994 --> 02:58:13.775]  This is today's.
[02:58:14.515 --> 02:58:17.757]  Olympians bid a fond adieu to Paris.
[02:58:20.358 --> 02:58:21.019]  Five hours.
[02:58:21.039 --> 02:58:23.580]  What are you telling me this crap for?
[02:58:23.600 --> 02:58:24.641]  What am I six years old?
[02:58:25.504 --> 02:58:26.204]  I'm buying this thing.
[02:58:26.244 --> 02:58:27.325]  I need economic data.
[02:58:27.785 --> 02:58:28.826]  I'm a trend forecast.
[02:58:29.306 --> 02:58:30.066]  I need data.
[02:58:30.726 --> 02:58:32.147]  Now, you don't need data.
[02:58:32.347 --> 02:58:33.968]  You gotta stay stupid!
[02:58:35.909 --> 02:58:36.109]  Here.
[02:58:37.770 --> 02:58:38.590]  Weekend edition.
[02:58:42.011 --> 02:58:42.732]  Six dollars.
[02:58:45.193 --> 02:58:46.393]  Look at that stupid picture.
[02:58:48.234 --> 02:58:51.556]  A new Olympic sport breaks out in Paris.
[02:58:52.836 --> 02:58:54.077]  American b-girl
[02:58:55.083 --> 02:59:07.165]  Logsist's legal name, Logan Edra, competes Friday in the Palace de la Concorde at the Games' first breaking event.
[02:59:08.125 --> 02:59:12.366]  Japan's B-Girl ended up winning the gold.
[02:59:15.087 --> 02:59:16.827]  What am I, six years old?
[02:59:16.847 --> 02:59:17.727]  I gotta know this crap?
[02:59:19.107 --> 02:59:21.768]  So, the Trends Journal, by the way, when you go to
[02:59:22.691 --> 02:59:24.271]  Jonestrends.com.
[02:59:24.291 --> 02:59:25.331]  You put that link in there.
[02:59:26.232 --> 02:59:28.832]  It's the grand total.
[02:59:31.312 --> 02:59:37.754]  This is $2.50 a week and over 200 pages.
[02:59:38.054 --> 02:59:38.734]  It's a magazine.
[02:59:38.754 --> 02:59:39.574]  You read what you want.
[02:59:39.634 --> 02:59:41.054]  You want to read about geopolitics.
[02:59:41.374 --> 02:59:42.554]  You want to read about economics.
[02:59:43.014 --> 02:59:44.715]  You want to read about high-tech science.
[02:59:44.755 --> 02:59:46.355]  You want to read about technocracy.
[02:59:46.835 --> 02:59:51.796]  You want to read about the Israel war, Ukraine war, the presidential reality show.
[02:59:52.566 --> 02:59:55.308]  Again, we cover the world, like nobody else anywhere.
[02:59:56.189 --> 03:00:04.756]  So going back, when you're looking at when I went on the air, the S&P and the Dow were down, the Nasdaq was barely up.
[03:00:07.218 --> 03:00:17.766]  We are on the cusp of the worst geopolitical and socio-economic crisis in the history of the world, part one and part two.
[03:00:18.847 --> 03:00:20.248]  This thing's gonna go down big.
[03:00:21.149 --> 03:00:21.409]  Again,
[03:00:22.426 --> 03:00:37.811]  What we're talking about, no one, anywhere, any place, is giving you the details that we're giving you, and particularly regarding the office building bust.
[03:00:40.851 --> 03:00:43.332]  I mentioned what the vacancy rates are.
[03:00:45.033 --> 03:00:48.614]  Your office occupancy rate, meaning people going back to work, is only around 50%.
[03:00:51.169 --> 03:01:01.653]  How are the people, these groups, these hedge funds, venture capitalists, and all these other biggies, that own all these buildings, their loans are coming through.
[03:01:03.733 --> 03:01:06.714]  And people aren't renewing their leases in the buildings.
[03:01:08.515 --> 03:01:10.776]  How are they going to pay their debt off to the banks?
[03:01:13.317 --> 03:01:13.717]  They're not.
[03:01:16.238 --> 03:01:19.319]  Talking about the danger ahead, nobody's reporting this, this is from
[03:01:20.290 --> 03:01:22.832]  Today's Wall Street Journal.
[03:01:23.792 --> 03:01:28.135]  Travel crunch pinches San Francisco hotels.
[03:01:28.675 --> 03:01:30.577]  Now, isn't that nice kiddie language?
[03:01:31.037 --> 03:01:32.338]  Oh, it pinches them.
[03:01:32.758 --> 03:01:33.999]  Oh, I got a pinch.
[03:01:34.599 --> 03:01:35.660]  I got a pinch.
[03:01:36.480 --> 03:01:37.241]  Grow up!
[03:01:38.922 --> 03:01:39.582]  Pinches.
[03:01:42.064 --> 03:01:44.505]  Listen, Salenti, you're still in kindergarten.
[03:01:44.565 --> 03:01:46.126]  Listen to what your teachers tell you.
[03:01:46.467 --> 03:01:47.487]  Time to take a nap.
[03:01:48.468 --> 03:01:48.708]  All right.
[03:01:50.200 --> 03:01:54.323]  San Francisco's hospitality business imploded during the pandemic.
[03:01:55.064 --> 03:01:59.527]  Now its hotel owners are drowning in bad debt as never before.
[03:02:00.848 --> 03:02:03.130]  Again, this is how they rewrite history.
[03:02:03.971 --> 03:02:06.352]  And this is why you get to transgerm.
[03:02:08.714 --> 03:02:12.737]  San Francisco's hospitality business imploded during the pandemic.
[03:02:13.118 --> 03:02:16.020]  No, it didn't implode during the pandemic.
[03:02:16.776 --> 03:02:30.702]  It imploded when pieces of arrogant scum, lousy little boys, that are arrogant as could be, that love to tell you what to do, locked down the place.
[03:02:32.062 --> 03:02:35.844]  That's right, not the pandemic, the politicians.
[03:02:38.105 --> 03:02:45.088]  And the scum called it a pandemic, the World Health
[03:02:46.084 --> 03:03:05.134]  Health Organization, WHO, the World Horror Organization, called it a pandemic on March 11th, 2020, when the grand total of 4,219 people died out of 8 billion.
[03:03:05.574 --> 03:03:08.235]  More people fell down the stairs and died that time.
[03:03:10.536 --> 03:03:11.837]  So that's how they rewrite history.
[03:03:13.024 --> 03:03:17.386]  That, that lousy, arrogant, arrogant, arrogant, arrogant boy!
[03:03:18.907 --> 03:03:20.508]  Got some Gavin Newsome.
[03:03:24.570 --> 03:03:32.373]  I'm dining at the French Laundry while you have to stay home and follow my orders.
[03:03:32.434 --> 03:03:34.555]  It's only $400 a plate.
[03:03:35.015 --> 03:03:37.396]  You're just a plantation workers of Slavelandia.
[03:03:37.676 --> 03:03:39.117]  You get back in your house.
[03:03:40.437 --> 03:03:41.318]  They destroyed it.
[03:03:41.897 --> 03:03:42.357]  There he is.
[03:03:42.738 --> 03:03:43.138]  Arrogant.
[03:03:43.498 --> 03:03:43.879]  Arrogant.
[03:03:44.199 --> 03:03:44.539]  Arrogant.
[03:03:45.580 --> 03:03:49.223]  That we have politicians telling us what to do.
[03:03:49.603 --> 03:03:50.764]  Who the F are you?
[03:03:51.124 --> 03:03:53.246]  Who are you to tell me what to do?
[03:03:53.606 --> 03:03:53.886]  Who?
[03:03:53.987 --> 03:03:54.727]  Come over here.
[03:03:55.127 --> 03:03:55.528]  Come over here.
[03:03:55.628 --> 03:03:56.348]  Any of you guys.
[03:03:56.609 --> 03:03:59.371]  Come over here and give me orders and tell me something to do.
[03:03:59.551 --> 03:03:59.791]  Come on.
[03:04:00.251 --> 03:04:00.632]  Let's go.
[03:04:01.292 --> 03:04:01.572]  Come on.
[03:04:01.833 --> 03:04:02.093]  Come on.
[03:04:03.654 --> 03:04:04.535]  I am an American.
[03:04:06.236 --> 03:04:06.997]  Free to be me.
[03:04:07.797 --> 03:04:08.838]  Don't tell me who to be.
[03:04:09.399 --> 03:04:10.159]  And I won't tell you.
[03:04:10.840 --> 03:04:11.080]  Got it?
[03:04:11.917 --> 03:04:12.918]  No, no, no, no!
[03:04:13.978 --> 03:04:15.939]  I'm a low-life politician!
[03:04:16.560 --> 03:04:17.741]  I'm a piece of scum!
[03:04:18.241 --> 03:04:19.502]  I'll tell you what to do!
[03:04:20.122 --> 03:04:25.565]  Going back to this date, they have destroyed the global economy with this pandemic.
[03:04:27.246 --> 03:04:30.588]  They're little morons out here, right across the streets, a parking lot.
[03:04:31.509 --> 03:04:36.092]  They moved the farmers' market off the streets, put it in a parking lot.
[03:04:36.672 --> 03:04:41.435]  Outside, they're drawing circles every six feet to go into the parking lot during COVID.
[03:04:43.590 --> 03:04:48.351]  Little boys and girls still in kindergarten, with chalk, drawing circles.
[03:04:48.812 --> 03:04:52.553]  And in front of each vendor, measuring out circles six feet.
[03:04:52.753 --> 03:04:53.653]  You're outside!
[03:04:53.693 --> 03:04:55.374]  The wind is blowing everywhere!
[03:04:56.014 --> 03:04:58.294]  Salenti, stay in that circle.
[03:04:59.175 --> 03:05:01.736]  And counting the number of people going into the parking lot.
[03:05:01.756 --> 03:05:02.376]  It's a parking lot.
[03:05:02.396 --> 03:05:03.196]  It's an open parking lot.
[03:05:04.133 --> 03:05:06.194]  The wind goes all like, no it doesn't!
[03:05:06.634 --> 03:05:11.537]  The wind blows exactly in straight lines every six feet!
[03:05:11.837 --> 03:05:13.878]  Now you do what you're told!
[03:05:14.398 --> 03:05:14.919]  Yes, sir.
[03:05:15.259 --> 03:05:15.819]  Yes, sir.
[03:05:19.741 --> 03:05:30.787]  The city's metropolitan area, the delinquency rate among commercial mortgage-backed security loans for the lodging sector skyrocketed
[03:05:32.361 --> 03:05:33.621]  To 41.6% in June, from 5.7% in June 2023.
[03:05:33.661 --> 03:05:39.924]  The shop drop-off in visitors is squeezing the city's hospitality sector.
[03:05:40.224 --> 03:05:41.544]  Weekend hotel occupancy in June
[03:06:03.797 --> 03:06:07.618]  The leisure travel, it's only down 22%.
[03:06:10.640 --> 03:06:12.160]  Versus 4% nationwide.
[03:06:13.601 --> 03:06:13.901]  Down.
[03:06:14.901 --> 03:06:15.682]  Hey, wait a minute.
[03:06:15.702 --> 03:06:17.822]  That's five years ago almost.
[03:06:21.224 --> 03:06:27.406]  It's down from what it used to be around the nation five years ago.
[03:06:27.746 --> 03:06:29.607]  In five years, it should have gone up.
[03:06:31.027 --> 03:06:37.529]  The delinquency rates, the failures in the banks, are going to be a banking bust that we've never seen before.
[03:06:38.009 --> 03:06:39.529]  Are the malls going bust?
[03:06:40.769 --> 03:06:43.410]  Hospitality sector going bust in certain areas?
[03:06:46.511 --> 03:06:47.251]  Oh, and the crap.
[03:06:47.951 --> 03:06:51.352]  Oh, the people aren't going to the amusement parks as much as they were.
[03:06:51.372 --> 03:06:54.113]  Oh, because they're traveling.
[03:06:54.453 --> 03:06:55.613]  Yeah, what are you talking about?
[03:06:57.313 --> 03:06:59.574]  The failed banks are going to be
[03:07:00.706 --> 03:07:04.427]  The bust in banks as a result of the crash.
[03:07:05.748 --> 03:07:06.168]  You got it.
[03:07:08.408 --> 03:07:13.450]  Of the office building bust is going to be the likes of which we've never ever seen before.
[03:07:14.470 --> 03:07:17.491]  Is going to be massive failures and massive banks going bust.
[03:07:18.952 --> 03:07:22.253]  Remember let's go back to twenty twenty three it's not ancient history.
[03:07:23.873 --> 03:07:26.754]  Three banks the silicon con man valley bank.
[03:07:28.010 --> 03:07:30.551]  First Republican signature bank went bust.
[03:07:30.992 --> 03:07:31.612]  Three banks!
[03:07:32.072 --> 03:07:32.632]  Three banks!
[03:07:33.393 --> 03:07:33.613]  Woof!
[03:07:34.613 --> 03:07:34.854]  Boom!
[03:07:35.454 --> 03:07:36.494]  Gold prices spiked.
[03:07:39.216 --> 03:07:40.056]  Markets went down.
[03:07:40.476 --> 03:07:41.057]  Three banks.
[03:07:41.757 --> 03:07:42.798]  Now let's look at about 300 banks.
[03:07:42.838 --> 03:07:46.119]  Because that's what you're going to be looking at.
[03:07:47.240 --> 03:07:57.365]  And again, this isn't only about the United States, it's global.
[03:07:58.391 --> 03:08:12.173]  Remember, the COVID war was launched in China on Chinese Lunar New Year, the year of the rat, in 2020.
[03:08:12.253 --> 03:08:19.915]  The cover, remember the people they're showing the BS guy walking down the street dying?
[03:08:20.455 --> 03:08:24.436]  Oh, and China's building all of these emergency hospital centers.
[03:08:24.456 --> 03:08:25.296]  Remember all that stuff?
[03:08:26.116 --> 03:08:26.856]  Selling the fear.
[03:08:28.402 --> 03:08:33.204]  In Italy, I'm ashamed as an Italian.
[03:08:34.804 --> 03:08:37.265]  It was the first country to lock down after that.
[03:08:37.725 --> 03:08:41.606]  The average age of the people dying from COVID in Italy was like 81 years old.
[03:08:42.687 --> 03:08:44.547]  I think the average death age in America is like 77, 78.
[03:08:45.688 --> 03:08:49.869]  I only got a couple of months left, I'll be hitting 78.
[03:08:56.437 --> 03:09:01.139]  The cover of the Trends Journal magazine, two weeks after China launched the COVID war.
[03:09:03.580 --> 03:09:04.400]  Coronavirus.
[03:09:05.581 --> 03:09:07.582]  106 dead in China.
[03:09:07.602 --> 03:09:08.382]  This is big news.
[03:09:09.242 --> 03:09:11.863]  Our next line was 1.4 billion still alive.
[03:09:12.564 --> 03:09:13.364]  A new Black Plague?
[03:09:15.045 --> 03:09:21.187]  With the Black Plague, what, about 60% of Europe was wiped out because of their filthy sanitation?
[03:09:24.729 --> 03:09:25.269]  How many people
[03:09:26.468 --> 03:09:27.068]  Are alive.
[03:09:27.989 --> 03:09:28.890]  Since the covid war.
[03:09:30.571 --> 03:09:32.051]  Only about the ninety nine.
[03:09:33.272 --> 03:09:34.893]  Point three percent.
[03:09:36.254 --> 03:09:39.876]  It's higher than that because if you fell off a ladder and broken neck.
[03:09:42.278 --> 03:09:45.560]  Any tested you positive for covid you died of covid.
[03:09:47.481 --> 03:09:49.942]  Remember all the stupid things they had you know.
[03:09:53.348 --> 03:09:58.032]  The things they put on the doors, you know, so you wouldn't have to open the door with your hand, you could do it with your foot.
[03:09:59.013 --> 03:10:00.154]  Remember all that stupid stuff?
[03:10:01.255 --> 03:10:01.435]  Yeah.
[03:10:01.855 --> 03:10:03.977]  Remember everybody sanitizing their hands?
[03:10:05.458 --> 03:10:08.061]  Don't forget, when you masturbate, sanitize your hands!
[03:10:09.222 --> 03:10:12.384]  And look at the clowns, the little freaks that were doing this.
[03:10:12.885 --> 03:10:13.365]  Look at them!
[03:10:13.766 --> 03:10:14.206]  Look at them!
[03:10:15.126 --> 03:10:16.927]  Health minister, health secretary.
[03:10:17.268 --> 03:10:21.070]  Yeah, like Lola or Rachel Levine or, oh no, it was Richard Levine.
[03:10:21.371 --> 03:10:23.452]  He cut off this or that and became that or this.
[03:10:24.313 --> 03:10:28.215]  And you got me, a guy got more chins than Chinatown and he's telling me what to do?
[03:10:29.056 --> 03:10:30.717]  Oh, never talk about natural healing.
[03:10:30.977 --> 03:10:32.459]  One of the first books I worked on back in 1986.
[03:10:32.859 --> 03:10:33.099]  Yeah.
[03:10:34.880 --> 03:10:35.601]  Don't get healthy.
[03:10:36.321 --> 03:10:37.322]  Swallow our crap.
[03:10:37.662 --> 03:10:38.463]  Take that jab.
[03:10:39.235 --> 03:10:39.675]  Yeah, look at this.
[03:10:39.695 --> 03:10:40.176]  Look at this.
[03:10:40.436 --> 03:10:42.317]  Could you imagine this thing telling you about health?
[03:10:42.637 --> 03:10:43.218]  Could you imagine?
[03:10:43.518 --> 03:10:44.879]  How stupid can you be?
[03:10:45.800 --> 03:10:46.860]  Very stupid!
[03:10:47.701 --> 03:10:50.603]  He's our assistant health secretary.
[03:10:51.264 --> 03:10:51.704]  Yes, sir.
[03:10:52.705 --> 03:10:53.245]  Look at this guy.
[03:10:53.985 --> 03:10:55.046]  Guy, girl, this, that.
[03:10:55.787 --> 03:10:56.367]  Or the other thing.
[03:10:57.508 --> 03:10:58.168]  Lola.
[03:10:58.609 --> 03:10:59.449]  L-O-L-A.
[03:10:59.509 --> 03:11:00.210]  Lola.
[03:11:01.931 --> 03:11:04.493]  So I'm saying, China started this thing.
[03:11:06.232 --> 03:11:26.196]  I used to say that the 20th century was the Chinese century, but the 21st century would be, excuse me, the 20th century was the American century, and the 21st century would be the Chinese century, because the business of America is war, and the business of China is business.
[03:11:28.616 --> 03:11:32.857]  They launched a COVID war, three years zero COVID policy,
[03:11:33.644 --> 03:11:39.409]  And week after week after week after week after week, we have a spotlight on China's economy.
[03:11:41.250 --> 03:11:45.594]  They have a real estate crisis that no amount of money is going to fix.
[03:11:47.515 --> 03:11:50.778]  Three years of zero COVID policy destroyed their economy.
[03:11:51.238 --> 03:11:52.739]  We write the data all the time.
[03:11:54.441 --> 03:11:56.142]  Exports are down, imports are down.
[03:11:58.083 --> 03:12:00.045]  GDP keeps going down.
[03:12:01.391 --> 03:12:12.559]  It was overbuilt before this happened, because when they got into the World Trade Organization in 2001, two weeks after 9-11, their economy boomed.
[03:12:14.301 --> 03:12:16.622]  And like with all booms, it's followed by a bust.
[03:12:18.544 --> 03:12:24.308]  But the zero COVID policy made a very bad situation, much worse, and it's hurting
[03:12:25.302 --> 03:12:27.663]  Again, it's not what you like, what you want, what you wish for.
[03:12:27.683 --> 03:12:29.544]  We're trend forkers, if you call it like it is.
[03:12:29.604 --> 03:12:30.945]  Like, people can't stand me now.
[03:12:31.646 --> 03:12:32.726]  Yeah, I love Trump.
[03:12:33.026 --> 03:12:34.187]  Yeah, I don't like any of them.
[03:12:34.527 --> 03:12:42.131]  But I'm saying Harris is going to win unless there's like a market downturn that's serious, a market crash, a wild card.
[03:12:42.852 --> 03:12:45.213]  Because abortion is going to be a major issue.
[03:12:45.253 --> 03:12:47.374]  It was in the 2022 midterm elections.
[03:12:47.694 --> 03:12:48.955]  And they're going to keep playing that card.
[03:12:48.975 --> 03:12:53.898]  And they're going to try to play both sides, flip the coin of the Israel war.
[03:12:55.026 --> 03:12:56.426]  No peace candidates, by the way.
[03:12:56.466 --> 03:12:57.367]  Peace is prohibited.
[03:12:58.247 --> 03:13:01.687]  So now I'm going back and seeing what's going on in China.
[03:13:02.288 --> 03:13:04.508]  This is from the Financial Times today.
[03:13:05.348 --> 03:13:10.349]  Global businesses warn sluggish China demand is taking a heavy toll.
[03:13:11.049 --> 03:13:11.370]  Oh, yeah?
[03:13:11.890 --> 03:13:19.171]  Oh, we've only been saying this now for... We warned about this for three years.
[03:13:20.832 --> 03:13:22.472]  And now it's just making the news.
[03:13:25.063 --> 03:13:33.047]  And that's why you go to TrendsJournal.com, put Jones Trends, and you get a history before it happens.
[03:13:33.067 --> 03:13:35.208]  $2.50 a week.
[03:13:35.268 --> 03:13:36.749]  Nothing!
[03:13:37.049 --> 03:13:37.249]  Nothing!
[03:13:38.350 --> 03:13:42.412]  And again, just like supporting the Trends Journal, the more subscribers we have, the more we can do.
[03:13:42.472 --> 03:13:45.974]  Not in terms of giving you information, but getting the word of truth out there.
[03:13:46.494 --> 03:13:47.675]  If you want to stay stupid,
[03:13:49.085 --> 03:13:49.726]  Keep going.
[03:13:49.806 --> 03:13:51.347]  Of course, not the people listening here.
[03:13:51.367 --> 03:13:52.808]  I don't have to tell you, you're not doing that.
[03:13:53.268 --> 03:13:55.510]  But for the other people, they stay stupid.
[03:13:55.910 --> 03:13:56.671]  I like Fox.
[03:13:56.771 --> 03:13:58.032]  I like MSNBC.
[03:13:58.072 --> 03:13:58.992]  I like Mickey Mouse.
[03:13:59.052 --> 03:14:00.073]  I like Donald Duck.
[03:14:00.333 --> 03:14:01.574]  Oh no, I like Goofy.
[03:14:01.875 --> 03:14:02.835]  Oh, I like NPR.
[03:14:04.737 --> 03:14:15.445]  So, your real estate sector in China, just the real estate, accounts for almost 30% of the nation's gross domestic product.
[03:14:16.265 --> 03:14:17.266]  And this thing's crashing.
[03:14:20.396 --> 03:14:21.757]  So this is going to get really bad.
[03:14:23.117 --> 03:14:28.900]  And on the other side, all of these countries, the bricks keep getting bigger.
[03:14:30.140 --> 03:14:35.362]  And they've had enough of America's geopolitical and economic hegemony.
[03:14:37.103 --> 03:14:38.864]  The death of the dollar is coming.
[03:14:39.564 --> 03:14:41.005]  Again, we don't tell you what to do.
[03:14:44.907 --> 03:14:47.928]  As interest rates go down, the dollar goes lower.
[03:14:49.648 --> 03:14:54.071]  As the dollar goes lower, gold prices go higher.
[03:14:56.033 --> 03:15:02.617]  We can see gold hitting this year about $3,000 an ounce.
[03:15:04.178 --> 03:15:06.960]  And again, you have to look at the geopolitics, not what you like.
[03:15:07.040 --> 03:15:08.121]  I support Ukraine.
[03:15:08.181 --> 03:15:08.902]  I hate Ukraine.
[03:15:09.182 --> 03:15:10.123]  I support Israel.
[03:15:10.163 --> 03:15:11.123]  I can't stand Israel.
[03:15:11.323 --> 03:15:12.024]  No, it's not that.
[03:15:12.364 --> 03:15:13.325]  It's what's going on.
[03:15:15.386 --> 03:15:16.407]  And they're both escalating.
[03:15:17.944 --> 03:15:19.165]  You read your Trends Journal.
[03:15:19.185 --> 03:15:20.305]  What happened this past week?
[03:15:21.626 --> 03:15:28.330]  Oh, Ukraine hit a nuclear plant, power plant, Russian occupied nuclear power plant.
[03:15:29.311 --> 03:15:32.053]  How long have we been warning this in your Trends Journal?
[03:15:35.515 --> 03:15:36.435]  For a year and a half.
[03:15:39.557 --> 03:15:44.180]  And when something like that, you're going to hear, we have to go to war to stop Russia.
[03:15:45.160 --> 03:15:47.542]  Because when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:15:48.590 --> 03:15:50.432]  And the economies are going to fail.
[03:15:52.173 --> 03:15:55.295]  And if we don't have peace on Earth, it's going to be hell on Earth.
[03:15:55.836 --> 03:15:57.497]  Again, look what they did to Scott Ritter.
[03:15:58.118 --> 03:16:01.660]  And Scott Ritter is going to be a speaker at OccupyPeace.com.
[03:16:02.101 --> 03:16:06.464]  We're having a peace and freedom rally up here in Kingston, New York, on September 28th.
[03:16:07.365 --> 03:16:15.812]  Scott Ritter, Judge Napolitano, Anya Powerful, Max Blumenthal, and others.
[03:16:17.950 --> 03:16:23.635]  So we need to support peace and you need to support InfoWars because InfoWars is supporting you.
[03:16:24.949 --> 03:16:26.150]  We got a lot more to talk about.
[03:16:26.170 --> 03:16:26.890]  We'll be right back.
[03:16:27.310 --> 03:16:28.330]  How's it going, Harrison?
[03:16:28.370 --> 03:16:29.691]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:16:29.711 --> 03:16:31.152]  You guys have the best crew.
[03:16:31.472 --> 03:16:32.652]  You guys are awesome.
[03:16:32.712 --> 03:16:34.093]  Just wanted to plug real quick.
[03:16:34.293 --> 03:16:41.956]  Just recently found out after 14 years, I got a quarter or half my muscle torn off from my shoulder blade, right?
[03:16:41.996 --> 03:16:44.177]  So I've been in constant pain for years.
[03:16:44.637 --> 03:16:49.459]  And the turmeric, the nitric boost, the fish oil, everything.
[03:16:49.739 --> 03:16:53.620]  If I don't take it, dude, I'm totally feeling it and I'm on the floor.
[03:16:53.640 --> 03:16:57.762]  This is one of the only things is your products that gets me going.
[03:16:57.902 --> 03:17:01.303]  It's helping me and I've been in pain for 14 years.
[03:17:01.643 --> 03:17:03.184]  You guys gotta try some of it.
[03:17:03.444 --> 03:17:03.744]  Wow.
[03:17:04.064 --> 03:17:04.784]  It's true, folks.
[03:17:04.824 --> 03:17:06.705]  You hear people call in like this all the time.
[03:17:07.165 --> 03:17:13.429]  These products are life-changing if you take them as directed, especially combined with exercise and a good diet.
[03:17:13.749 --> 03:17:17.871]  Things like Bodies, the Turmeric Supplement, Turmeric 95 from InfoWarsMD.
[03:17:18.311 --> 03:17:21.933]  Incredibly powerful, life-changing stuff at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:17:21.973 --> 03:17:22.634]  Thanks for the call, Drew.
[03:17:22.654 --> 03:17:29.858]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[03:17:30.658 --> 03:17:33.580]  And again, you know, we're at a very crucial time here.
[03:17:34.484 --> 03:17:39.006]  And they're robbing us of our freedom, our life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:17:40.086 --> 03:17:43.528]  Things that used to be once called a Declaration of Independence.
[03:17:44.648 --> 03:17:46.609]  Again, you just saw what they did to Scott Ritter.
[03:17:47.169 --> 03:17:49.150]  Barely reported in the mainstream media.
[03:17:49.390 --> 03:17:50.251]  Barely reported.
[03:17:51.731 --> 03:18:00.275]  And in this crucial time, you need what, not only what we're giving you with the Trends Journal, but what InfoWars is giving you.
[03:18:00.675 --> 03:18:03.136]  And they have these great products and great sales,
[03:18:04.085 --> 03:18:07.968]  That you're not only supporting InfoWars, but you're supporting yourself.
[03:18:08.829 --> 03:18:11.010]  And they have a good sale going on right now.
[03:18:11.590 --> 03:18:14.192]  And it's their mega sale.
[03:18:15.193 --> 03:18:21.738]  And you can save up to 60% on their InfoWars products by going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:18:22.578 --> 03:18:29.063]  They got the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Survival Shield X2, Ultra 12.
[03:18:30.424 --> 03:18:31.024]  That's like 40% off.
[03:18:32.742 --> 03:18:48.569]  DNA Force Plus, Survival Shield X3, Basso Beat, Nitric Boost, Ultimate Fish Oil, Brain Force Ultra, and boy you gotta get that Brain Force going, particularly now.
[03:18:50.449 --> 03:18:57.352]  Winter Sun Plus, Prebiotic Fiber, and All Infowars MD.
[03:18:57.372 --> 03:19:00.694]  Again, you're getting between 60 to 25% off.
[03:19:02.449 --> 03:19:03.449]  All of these great products.
[03:19:04.850 --> 03:19:05.050]  Yep.
[03:19:05.230 --> 03:19:06.190]  Superfood greens.
[03:19:07.410 --> 03:19:08.150]  Nitric boost.
[03:19:09.791 --> 03:19:10.231]  Turmeric.
[03:19:12.552 --> 03:19:12.972]  Yep.
[03:19:13.292 --> 03:19:13.992]  One after another.
[03:19:15.072 --> 03:19:16.032]  All terrific products.
[03:19:17.113 --> 03:19:19.333]  So, go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:19:19.393 --> 03:19:20.774]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:19:21.294 --> 03:19:22.534]  Again, it's a crucial time.
[03:19:23.154 --> 03:19:25.895]  And we need to take a stand and fight for our republic.
[03:19:26.915 --> 03:19:28.315]  And the censorship is real.
[03:19:28.956 --> 03:19:30.576]  Keeps happening and only getting worse.
[03:19:31.368 --> 03:19:33.449]  And that's why your support is so crucial.
[03:19:34.169 --> 03:19:35.929]  Not only for InfoWars, but for yourself.
[03:19:35.969 --> 03:19:38.090]  You're supporting yourself by buying these products.
[03:19:38.750 --> 03:19:39.930]  It's that 360 win.
[03:19:40.550 --> 03:19:41.711]  You're supporting InfoWars.
[03:19:41.751 --> 03:19:44.331]  So visit InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:45.992 --> 03:19:46.532]  Right now.
[03:19:48.473 --> 03:19:48.713]  So.
[03:19:50.113 --> 03:19:51.573]  Going back onto the markets.
[03:19:51.593 --> 03:19:54.234]  You know, we don't tell you what to do.
[03:19:54.654 --> 03:19:56.095]  We only give you trend forecasts.
[03:19:56.795 --> 03:19:57.135]  And again.
[03:19:57.970 --> 03:20:04.155]  When you look at Bitcoin, when Bitcoin, when the markets were going down, way down, and they said, oh, this is the end of Bitcoin.
[03:20:04.175 --> 03:20:04.776]  I said, no, it's not.
[03:20:04.836 --> 03:20:07.598]  We gave you the breakout points of where Bitcoin is going.
[03:20:07.638 --> 03:20:09.400]  Again, we see Bitcoin as a gamble.
[03:20:11.101 --> 03:20:13.143]  We don't see that, and I gambled in it.
[03:20:13.323 --> 03:20:18.728]  I first bought Bitcoin at $17,000, and now it's about $60,000.
[03:20:19.489 --> 03:20:22.691]  And a lot of people bought it way before me.
[03:20:22.972 --> 03:20:23.852]  I didn't see it coming.
[03:20:24.593 --> 03:20:25.734]  I wasn't that smart about it.
[03:20:26.798 --> 03:20:28.258]  But gold is a different story.
[03:20:28.318 --> 03:20:35.661]  I began buying gold at a hundred and I think it was 180 or 160 something dollars an ounce back in the late 70s.
[03:20:37.001 --> 03:20:38.781]  And that's when I became a trend forecaster.
[03:20:39.122 --> 03:20:42.402]  The Iran war was breaking out.
[03:20:42.522 --> 03:20:50.225]  Just how they taught us to hate Russia, they taught us to hate Iran without knowing how the United States overthrew the democratically elected government of
[03:20:52.054 --> 03:20:58.015]  Mosaddegh in 1953, Kermit Roosevelt and Churchill, MI6 and the CIA.
[03:20:59.295 --> 03:21:04.456]  Because Mosaddegh had the nerve, the gall, the disrespect to say no.
[03:21:05.836 --> 03:21:12.398]  Anglo-Iranian oil, better known as BP, and Standard Oil, better known as ExxonMobil.
[03:21:12.778 --> 03:21:16.598]  No, they don't own our oil in Iran.
[03:21:17.238 --> 03:21:18.479]  We own that oil.
[03:21:19.419 --> 03:21:20.199]  No you don't!
[03:21:21.360 --> 03:21:22.480]  Who are you talking to?
[03:21:24.021 --> 03:21:34.844]  As I say, you think we would have invaded Libya and be in Syria where we are and invade Iraq if their major export was broccoli?
[03:21:35.984 --> 03:21:37.204]  It's a crime syndicate.
[03:21:38.144 --> 03:21:40.045]  And the crime syndicate runs the country.
[03:21:41.205 --> 03:21:42.085]  Oh, don't believe me?
[03:21:42.766 --> 03:21:47.487]  How about all these billionaires and multi-millionaires donating to Trump and to Harris?
[03:21:48.928 --> 03:21:51.489]  Was it going to be a couple of billion dollars worth of a campaign?
[03:21:51.509 --> 03:21:53.750]  A republic?
[03:21:54.791 --> 03:21:56.771]  You got no money, you got no choice.
[03:21:59.713 --> 03:22:01.493]  All the politicians are paid off.
[03:22:01.513 --> 03:22:02.234]  All of them.
[03:22:04.295 --> 03:22:05.175]  Politicians.
[03:22:06.095 --> 03:22:07.136]  Pieces of crap.
[03:22:08.096 --> 03:22:14.299]  I mean, humanity had to succumb to politicians telling us what to do.
[03:22:18.095 --> 03:22:19.396]  Again, your t-shirt.
[03:22:20.877 --> 03:22:24.560]  Hey politicians, who the F are you to tell me what to do?
[03:22:25.621 --> 03:22:27.823]  Who the F are you to tell me what to do?
[03:22:28.703 --> 03:22:34.768]  So, going back to where we're going with this, going back to gold.
[03:22:36.910 --> 03:22:40.092]  You have to look at also the Middle East meltdown.
[03:22:40.873 --> 03:22:43.595]  That, by the way, was one of our top trends in 2023.
[03:22:43.675 --> 03:22:44.315]  People forget
[03:22:48.760 --> 03:23:03.409]  When Netanyahu was elected, not my language, the language from the mainstream media, he brought in, this is in December of 2022, quote, extreme right-wing government.
[03:23:05.030 --> 03:23:05.230]  Yeah.
[03:23:07.491 --> 03:23:12.914]  We were writing week after week after week from early January 2023,
[03:23:16.954 --> 03:23:36.758]  To October 7th, 2023, when Hamas attacked, how the terrible things that the Netanyahu government was doing to the Palestinian people, week after week after week, under this extreme right-wing government.
[03:23:37.738 --> 03:23:41.839]  And again, I don't want to hear the fairy tale that God gave you this land, Chapter 6, Section 8.
[03:23:42.159 --> 03:23:44.900]  Oh, they just found a humanoid that goes back, what, 700,000 years?
[03:23:46.980 --> 03:23:49.741]  Oh no, everything began when Moses came down with the Ten Commandments.
[03:23:49.801 --> 03:23:51.322]  I thought he was 15, and he dropped five.
[03:23:51.342 --> 03:23:52.922]  I mean, that was in the Mel Brooks movie.
[03:23:55.523 --> 03:24:01.586]  It's stolen land, and you keep stealing it in violation of the Geneva Convention and Article 242 of the United Nations.
[03:24:01.886 --> 03:24:03.887]  And save your crap that I'm an anti-Semite.
[03:24:04.207 --> 03:24:07.548]  My best friends were anti-Semite, and three of my last four girlfriends were Jewish.
[03:24:09.909 --> 03:24:10.269]  Save it.
[03:24:10.429 --> 03:24:11.129]  Don't want to hear it.
[03:24:11.550 --> 03:24:14.951]  I'm not anti-American because I hate Americans wars, so save your crap.
[03:24:15.669 --> 03:24:18.771]  What's going on now in front of everybody's eyes, there should be outrage.
[03:24:18.952 --> 03:24:20.553]  And that's why I launched Occupy Peace.
[03:24:20.613 --> 03:24:21.393]  I'm against wars.
[03:24:22.034 --> 03:24:24.376]  And I launched Occupy Peace, what, how long ago?
[03:24:26.677 --> 03:24:27.638]  Over a decade ago?
[03:24:28.419 --> 03:24:28.639]  Yeah.
[03:24:30.080 --> 03:24:32.822]  So, again, support InfoWars.
[03:24:33.582 --> 03:24:36.325]  And get that Dr. Jones Naturals, because they're supporting you.
[03:24:36.985 --> 03:24:37.806]  So, moving forward.
[03:24:39.487 --> 03:24:44.831]  Germany Schultz asks Iran's president to prevent military escalation in the region.
[03:24:45.504 --> 03:24:46.825]  Again, going back to gold.
[03:24:47.565 --> 03:24:49.406]  Look at oil prices going up again.
[03:24:51.767 --> 03:25:00.912]  I knew gold would go up back in the late 70s when the United States interfered with Iran and didn't let the overthrow of the Shah happen.
[03:25:01.913 --> 03:25:03.854]  And millions of people were taking to the streets.
[03:25:04.594 --> 03:25:07.816]  I said, gold prices are going to go up and oil prices are going up.
[03:25:08.176 --> 03:25:09.717]  I started playing the futures market.
[03:25:09.837 --> 03:25:11.258]  I'm a young guy, I didn't know what I was doing.
[03:25:11.798 --> 03:25:12.899]  I put a $10,000 bet, $5,000 in each.
[03:25:15.737 --> 03:25:20.100]  In the futures markets, and brought it to almost three quarters of a million dollars.
[03:25:21.420 --> 03:25:23.162]  Yeah, I lost most of it.
[03:25:23.182 --> 03:25:24.082]  I ended up with like about 120,000.
[03:25:24.122 --> 03:25:28.145]  Yeah, I was, you know, didn't know what I was doing.
[03:25:28.185 --> 03:25:29.225]  I'm just gambling away.
[03:25:29.786 --> 03:25:33.007]  But I should have sold when they told me to sell, but I didn't.
[03:25:33.748 --> 03:25:42.093]  But anyway, the crisis going now on in the Middle East,
[03:25:44.542 --> 03:25:52.368]  This war expands, you're going to see oil prices spike to above $130 a barrel for Brent crude.
[03:25:54.950 --> 03:25:59.073]  When that happens, again, you look at the data, we put the data all the time.
[03:25:59.433 --> 03:26:03.096]  Again, you know that old saying, the fish rots from the head down?
[03:26:04.137 --> 03:26:11.703]  We're talking about China and how countries are importing less product there?
[03:26:13.064 --> 03:26:15.286]  And China, by the way, is becoming more self-sustaining.
[03:26:15.306 --> 03:26:17.568]  We'll get to go on to that, but that's a whole other one.
[03:26:18.129 --> 03:26:24.575]  So, going back to the slowdown, it's hurting everybody.
[03:26:27.197 --> 03:26:37.306]  So, if war breaks out, when your economy is already weak, you're seeing the crisis in the equity markets.
[03:26:37.346 --> 03:26:39.208]  I mean, you saw what happened with the Nikkei.
[03:26:41.625 --> 03:26:46.487]  A little over a week ago, hitting its lowest level in the history.
[03:26:46.687 --> 03:26:48.247]  Never went down that quick before.
[03:26:49.427 --> 03:26:53.528]  And you saw what happened to the Dow and the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.
[03:26:53.588 --> 03:26:56.869]  So we're in a very volatile time.
[03:26:59.210 --> 03:27:07.012]  So now with this war increasing in the Middle East and in Ukraine, the more it increases,
[03:27:08.163 --> 03:27:12.225]  The higher the price of gold.
[03:27:13.546 --> 03:27:21.450]  And the people that can't afford to buy gold, they're going to keep going more and more into the cryptos, particularly Bitcoin.
[03:27:23.071 --> 03:27:24.391]  That's the way we forecast it.
[03:27:25.592 --> 03:27:27.513]  And we don't tell you what to do.
[03:27:27.553 --> 03:27:28.894]  We don't give financial advice.
[03:27:29.434 --> 03:27:33.416]  And the motto of the Trends Journal is think for yourself.
[03:27:35.237 --> 03:27:35.617]  That's right.
[03:27:36.249 --> 03:27:38.490]  We don't tell you what to say, what to believe.
[03:27:38.770 --> 03:27:39.890]  We just put down the facts.
[03:27:39.930 --> 03:27:42.291]  This is what's being reported from Iran.
[03:27:42.311 --> 03:27:43.772]  This is what's being reported from Israel.
[03:27:43.812 --> 03:27:46.113]  This is being reported from the Arab nations.
[03:27:46.593 --> 03:27:48.494]  This is what's being reported in the West.
[03:27:49.114 --> 03:27:52.916]  And here's our trends, analysis, and trend forecasts.
[03:27:53.856 --> 03:28:02.099]  So now we have this article that just came out, the Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper, which we subscribe to because we want to get the news from everybody, hear how they say it.
[03:28:03.019 --> 03:28:03.920]  Germany's Schultz
[03:28:05.294 --> 03:28:09.096]  Asks Iran's president to prevent military escalation in the region.
[03:28:10.316 --> 03:28:23.401]  German Chancellor Olaf Schultz appealed to Iran's new president to do everything possible to prevent a further military escalation in the Middle East in a phone call on Monday, according to a German government spokesman.
[03:28:24.622 --> 03:28:34.866]  A spiral of violence in the Middle East must be broken now, as any other course would lead to incalculable danger for other countries and people in the region.
[03:28:37.139 --> 03:28:38.480]  This is the hypocrisy.
[03:28:39.580 --> 03:28:43.582]  Okay, it's great that you told Iran to prevent military escalation.
[03:28:44.042 --> 03:28:46.404]  How about telling Israel to prevent military escalation?
[03:28:46.704 --> 03:28:47.924]  Why, you anti-Semite?
[03:28:50.105 --> 03:28:52.186]  Only Israel has the right to defend themselves.
[03:28:52.226 --> 03:28:53.307]  Nobody else does.
[03:28:53.947 --> 03:28:55.968]  They could kill anybody they want anywhere.
[03:28:55.988 --> 03:28:57.749]  I want that guy out of there.
[03:28:57.769 --> 03:28:58.770]  Get him out of there.
[03:28:59.790 --> 03:29:00.891]  Yeah, he's a terrorist.
[03:29:00.951 --> 03:29:01.531]  Knock him out.
[03:29:04.532 --> 03:29:05.693]  Oh, you call him a terrorist, but
[03:29:06.494 --> 03:29:09.275]  Other nations don't call him a terrorist.
[03:29:09.295 --> 03:29:14.598]  60 nations, by the way, I believe the number is, that calls Hezbollah a terrorist.
[03:29:16.118 --> 03:29:19.200]  There are 195 nations in the world.
[03:29:20.560 --> 03:29:25.483]  How about all of those other ones, 130,000, that don't call them terrorists?
[03:29:26.903 --> 03:29:28.304]  How about Hezbollah being the
[03:29:29.139 --> 03:29:33.761]  The soldiers that fought to get Israel out of Lebanon in 2006.
[03:29:34.742 --> 03:29:36.182]  Oh no, God gave them that land.
[03:29:36.202 --> 03:29:37.483]  I forgot.
[03:29:37.783 --> 03:29:38.203]  I forgot.
[03:29:38.323 --> 03:29:39.424]  It's in the Good Book.
[03:29:40.884 --> 03:29:44.226]  And again, I don't want to hear what your God has believed.
[03:29:44.506 --> 03:29:48.848]  Don't you tell me about the God that I have to believe in and tell me I've got to believe in your God.
[03:29:48.868 --> 03:29:50.329]  You don't have to believe in my God.
[03:29:50.369 --> 03:29:51.569]  Don't tell me I've got to believe in your God.
[03:29:51.609 --> 03:29:52.109]  Don't want to hear it.
[03:29:52.430 --> 03:29:53.230]  Oh, and by the way,
[03:29:54.336 --> 03:29:57.737]  These little hypocritical little boys like this, Mike Johnson.
[03:29:57.857 --> 03:30:00.018]  Again, a little boy of nothing.
[03:30:00.038 --> 03:30:01.359]  A little boy of nothing.
[03:30:01.639 --> 03:30:05.140]  Why, I'm the House Majority Leader.
[03:30:05.581 --> 03:30:08.442]  I lead the majority of the morons in the House.
[03:30:09.182 --> 03:30:10.843]  Oh, I'm an evangelical Christian.
[03:30:11.643 --> 03:30:13.524]  Again, not what you like, what you dislike.
[03:30:14.384 --> 03:30:15.925]  Oh, we're anti-abortion.
[03:30:16.565 --> 03:30:18.706]  Oh, how dare you kill an unborn baby.
[03:30:19.066 --> 03:30:22.027]  But slaughter anybody you want anywhere else.
[03:30:22.563 --> 03:30:24.024]  Here's more money to do it!
[03:30:24.645 --> 03:30:26.386]  Oh yeah, kill them when they're alive!
[03:30:26.867 --> 03:30:28.208]  But don't kill them when they're born!
[03:30:28.488 --> 03:30:29.349]  Before they're born!
[03:30:29.909 --> 03:30:30.950]  Oh, that's a sin!
[03:30:32.372 --> 03:30:33.232]  What hypocrisy!
[03:30:34.113 --> 03:30:34.854]  What hypocrisy!
[03:30:36.315 --> 03:30:38.577]  Anti-abortion, but pro-war!
[03:30:39.077 --> 03:30:40.398]  Kill them when they're alive!
[03:30:40.739 --> 03:30:41.820]  Here's more money!
[03:30:43.481 --> 03:30:45.483]  As the people in America are going broke.
[03:30:47.885 --> 03:30:48.666]  Hypocrisy!
[03:30:53.467 --> 03:30:54.567]  And it just keeps getting worse.
[03:30:56.428 --> 03:30:56.648]  Yeah.
[03:30:59.709 --> 03:31:16.713]  Netanyahu came out Time Magazine saying that he said in an interview that the occupied West Bank is part of Israel's homeland and he intends
[03:31:19.821 --> 03:31:24.483]  Maintaining a presence there despite public clashes about the policy with some allies.
[03:31:27.865 --> 03:31:31.446]  In violation of Geneva Convention and Article 242 of the Constitution.
[03:31:31.906 --> 03:31:37.329]  Before I was going back to about what happened in 2013 that people forgot about.
[03:31:37.349 --> 03:31:46.073]  There were 39 weeks of protests up to the Hamas attack on October 7th.
[03:31:47.245 --> 03:31:58.313]  And by the way, which Haaretz says, about half the people killed, Israelis killed, the Hannibal Project, or object, whatever it is, where they were shooting at the people that Hamas has taken away.
[03:31:58.813 --> 03:32:01.575]  And they're blowing up kibbutzes, the kibbutz in everywhere else.
[03:32:01.616 --> 03:32:03.197]  So not my language, their language.
[03:32:04.237 --> 03:32:08.501]  So going back to this, there were 39 weeks of protest against the Netanyahu government.
[03:32:10.002 --> 03:32:11.783]  Against his Judicial Reform Act.
[03:32:12.583 --> 03:32:17.145]  That basically said the government is in charge, not the judicial system.
[03:32:18.486 --> 03:32:27.089]  39 weeks of protest, not my language, the language of the President of Israel, Isaac Herzog.
[03:32:28.990 --> 03:32:32.192]  Again, going back before October 7th.
[03:32:34.933 --> 03:32:36.634]  Israel is in a civil war.
[03:32:37.674 --> 03:32:37.874]  Yet.
[03:32:40.375 --> 03:32:42.016]  When all else fails, they take it away.
[03:32:43.365 --> 03:32:44.905]  People hated the Netanyahu government.
[03:32:46.666 --> 03:32:49.286]  Protesting, protesting, protesting, protesting.
[03:32:52.207 --> 03:32:52.907]  Now you know what?
[03:32:53.547 --> 03:32:55.727]  He's pushing through that Judicial Reform Act now.
[03:32:56.427 --> 03:32:56.887]  That's right.
[03:32:57.627 --> 03:33:00.568]  So he doesn't have to go to court for the charges he's being brought up on.
[03:33:02.888 --> 03:33:04.289]  They're gonna escalate this war.
[03:33:05.689 --> 03:33:07.809]  And then there's a thing called the Samson Option.
[03:33:08.089 --> 03:33:08.449]  Look it up.
[03:33:09.269 --> 03:33:10.130]  If you don't know what it is.
[03:33:11.070 --> 03:33:11.970]  S-A-M-S-O-N.
[03:33:14.318 --> 03:33:15.919]  If Israel loses, they go nuclear.
[03:33:20.461 --> 03:33:20.641]  Yeah.
[03:33:23.363 --> 03:33:27.165]  If we don't have peace, and Israel goes nuclear, it's going to be the end of life on Earth.
[03:33:27.185 --> 03:33:29.926]  It'll just keep escalating and escalating.
[03:33:31.747 --> 03:33:32.468]  Can you imagine this?
[03:33:34.069 --> 03:33:34.269]  Yeah.
[03:33:35.129 --> 03:33:36.690]  You got maniacs in charge.
[03:33:38.991 --> 03:33:41.893]  Crazy people are running the government in a country near you.
[03:33:43.326 --> 03:33:44.727]  Not a word about peace.
[03:33:45.668 --> 03:33:46.909]  Go to the mainstream media.
[03:33:47.530 --> 03:33:48.831]  Anybody talking about peace?
[03:33:49.292 --> 03:33:51.594]  Nah, you're just a piece of crap if you talk about peace.
[03:33:52.314 --> 03:33:53.115]  Like Scott Ritter.
[03:33:54.356 --> 03:33:54.957]  Man of peace.
[03:33:56.298 --> 03:33:56.919]  Anti-war.
[03:33:59.001 --> 03:34:00.282]  Send over the FBI.
[03:34:02.984 --> 03:34:03.145]  Yeah.
[03:34:04.005 --> 03:34:05.427]  I'm wondering when they're gonna come after me.
[03:34:05.767 --> 03:34:07.208]  With the looks they've done to Infowars.
[03:34:08.650 --> 03:34:08.830]  Again.
[03:34:09.597 --> 03:34:11.858]  What did Alex Jones do to deserve this?
[03:34:12.518 --> 03:34:15.739]  Oh, he said that, you know, Sandy Hook wasn't real.
[03:34:16.640 --> 03:34:16.920]  All right.
[03:34:19.721 --> 03:34:21.381]  So, he said it.
[03:34:22.102 --> 03:34:23.482]  Agree, disagree, right, wrong?
[03:34:27.444 --> 03:34:29.945]  How about Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction?
[03:34:32.286 --> 03:34:38.768]  How about that outright lie that killed over a million people in Iraq?
[03:34:39.557 --> 03:34:41.218]  And that's stalled between the two.
[03:34:41.318 --> 03:34:45.281]  I got Osama Bin Laden over there in Afghanistan.
[03:34:45.562 --> 03:34:50.325]  Of course, it's about $8 trillion of our money to go to a military-industrial complex to slaughter people.
[03:34:52.046 --> 03:34:53.047]  Not a word about peace.
[03:34:53.567 --> 03:34:54.028]  You know why?
[03:34:54.508 --> 03:35:01.654]  Because the prostitutes, the media whores that get paid to put out by the corporate pimps and government whoremasters are pieces of crap.
[03:35:02.234 --> 03:35:03.115]  That's why there's no peace.
[03:35:04.075 --> 03:35:08.919]  Little gutless boys and girls who talk tough, that couldn't fight the way they have a paper bag.
[03:35:11.761 --> 03:35:18.826]  So, going on, it's one thing after another.
[03:35:19.767 --> 03:35:24.650]  This guy Smutridge warns Netanyahu not to agree to a Gaza peace deal.
[03:35:27.012 --> 03:35:35.098]  And talking about this clown boy Schultz over there, the little jerk off over there in Germany, the Chancellor.
[03:35:36.739 --> 03:35:39.061]  This is an article that will be in the Trends Journal tomorrow.
[03:35:40.803 --> 03:35:42.644]  Germany bans freedom of speech.
[03:35:43.744 --> 03:35:48.227]  Protester fined for chanting from the river to the sea.
[03:35:49.527 --> 03:36:07.676]  The German court ruled last week that an anti-genocide protester should be fined 650 euros for yelling from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free during a rally last October in Berlin.
[03:36:10.484 --> 03:36:15.007]  A lawyer said, from my perspective, the slogan should never be part of a criminal investigation.
[03:36:15.948 --> 03:36:21.532]  If some people are unhappy with the phrase, they should be able to counter it with their own ideas.
[03:36:22.653 --> 03:36:25.115]  That is how a liberal democracy should work.
[03:36:27.336 --> 03:36:27.776]  No, no.
[03:36:28.197 --> 03:36:29.077]  No, no, no, no!
[03:36:29.838 --> 03:36:33.681]  You're only allowed to say what the government wants you to say.
[03:36:33.701 --> 03:36:36.543]  F you for freedom of speech.
[03:36:39.864 --> 03:36:41.845]  Went after InfoWars for freedom of speech.
[03:36:42.786 --> 03:36:44.707]  Went after Scott Ritter for freedom of speech.
[03:36:45.568 --> 03:36:47.549]  Going after this woman for freedom of speech.
[03:36:47.990 --> 03:36:51.232]  These are only tiny little examples.
[03:36:52.693 --> 03:36:57.176]  Goes back to, that's why you have to support InfoWars.
[03:36:58.296 --> 03:37:04.301]  Because InfoWars is giving you what you're not getting most places anywhere.
[03:37:04.681 --> 03:37:06.382]  Again, we provide trend forecasting.
[03:37:07.046 --> 03:37:12.947]  We give you geopolitical, economic, high-tech, science, AI, whole sections of this.
[03:37:13.007 --> 03:37:13.807]  Technocracy.
[03:37:13.887 --> 03:37:17.568]  Matter of fact, we got a guy here, Joe Duran.
[03:37:19.248 --> 03:37:20.468]  AI, the decline of humans.
[03:37:21.529 --> 03:37:23.329]  Look at his book.
[03:37:23.389 --> 03:37:24.609]  One book after another he has.
[03:37:26.249 --> 03:37:30.110]  And we give you whole sections on all this stuff.
[03:37:30.250 --> 03:37:35.651]  But InfoWars is giving you different kinds of information with different available data.
[03:37:36.801 --> 03:37:37.981]  So you gotta support them.
[03:37:39.002 --> 03:37:41.522]  And again, you're not only supporting Infowars, you're supporting yourself.
[03:37:43.023 --> 03:37:44.343]  And with the products that they have.
[03:37:45.063 --> 03:37:46.483]  So going on to what's going on.
[03:37:47.384 --> 03:37:52.685]  You know, this just came out, by the way, and this was a guy I supported, but no longer.
[03:37:52.705 --> 03:37:59.567]  This was the RFK Jr.
[03:37:59.587 --> 03:38:05.428]  Again, I had his former campaign manager speaking at one of my rallies.
[03:38:07.418 --> 03:38:21.605]  Last May, not this May, a year ago, Dennis Kucinich, RFK Jr., from his Children's Defense Fund, cell phone radiation causes cheek cells to die, study finds.
[03:38:23.186 --> 03:38:26.047]  And it goes on to show you the dangers of the cell phones.
[03:38:27.588 --> 03:38:35.832]  And I did work for the cellular telecommunications industry back in the 90s, the early 90s, when there were boxes.
[03:38:36.661 --> 03:38:38.182]  And the chunks of cars with aerials.
[03:38:39.023 --> 03:38:45.267]  And I've been studying all the data that came out about the dangers of this radio frequency radiation.
[03:38:46.207 --> 03:38:54.933]  In France, they banned cell phones for children under 12 years old because the brain shield is thinner and the radiation goes in deeper and quicker.
[03:38:56.094 --> 03:38:58.875]  But they did away with that when the big companies started taking over.
[03:38:59.896 --> 03:39:04.459]  I'm making this point because you're hardly reporting this anymore.
[03:39:05.174 --> 03:39:08.915]  The last data that came out was from the University of California, Berkeley.
[03:39:10.675 --> 03:39:21.918]  And, if you're on a cell phone, 17 minutes a day for 10 years, your chances of getting a brain tumor only increase by 10%.
[03:39:22.458 --> 03:39:23.759]  Excuse me, by 60%.
[03:39:26.719 --> 03:39:27.080]  60% increase.
[03:39:27.140 --> 03:39:29.100]  I don't carry a cell phone.
[03:39:29.360 --> 03:39:32.421]  I got an old flip phone that when I travel, I take it with me.
[03:39:32.481 --> 03:39:32.701]  That's it.
[03:39:35.029 --> 03:39:39.711]  So going back to Kennedy, the reason I don't support him is because of his pro-Israeli stance.
[03:39:40.311 --> 03:39:41.532]  And that killed his election.
[03:39:41.692 --> 03:39:43.012]  He had a shot at it before.
[03:39:44.713 --> 03:39:46.153]  But now he's finito.
[03:39:46.594 --> 03:39:46.854]  Done.
[03:39:48.094 --> 03:39:51.896]  So again, we're going through very, very, very critical times.
[03:39:52.916 --> 03:39:57.818]  And we're doing everything we can to help you prepare, prevail, and prosper in these times ahead.
[03:39:59.136 --> 03:40:09.925]  And so you subscribe to the Trends Journal, but you're going to TrendsJournal.com and you put in the Jones Trends and we gave you a 10% discount.
[03:40:10.005 --> 03:40:11.466]  It's like $2.50 a week.
[03:40:12.207 --> 03:40:18.852]  And again, it's so essential that you keep supporting InfoWars because they're going to keep going after them.
[03:40:19.432 --> 03:40:22.915]  They're going to go after everybody that does not, again,
[03:40:24.446 --> 03:40:27.027]  Regardless of who wins the election, we lose.
[03:40:27.507 --> 03:40:31.148]  Because it's still the repulsive kids and the Democrats in charge.
[03:40:32.449 --> 03:40:33.369]  It's a freak show.
[03:40:33.389 --> 03:40:41.912]  I mean, Thomas Massey is about the only person in there in all of Congress that I truly respect at so many different levels.
[03:40:43.052 --> 03:40:45.913]  But again, look at this guy, Chuckie Schumer.
[03:40:49.755 --> 03:40:50.815]  Little Lindsey Graham.
[03:40:52.230 --> 03:40:54.271]  You know, one little clown jerk after another.
[03:40:54.311 --> 03:40:55.792]  Name the party, name the place.
[03:40:58.193 --> 03:40:58.933]  Ted Cruz.
[03:40:59.373 --> 03:41:00.494]  Look at this jerk.
[03:41:01.134 --> 03:41:02.275]  Arrogant little clowns.
[03:41:03.515 --> 03:41:04.696]  So whoever wins, we lose.
[03:41:04.736 --> 03:41:06.557]  So we have to support freedom of speech.
[03:41:07.237 --> 03:41:09.218]  And freedom to be who you want to be.
[03:41:09.258 --> 03:41:11.659]  Don't tell me, you be you, I'll be me.
[03:41:12.560 --> 03:41:12.900]  Capisce?
[03:41:14.022 --> 03:41:15.983]  And so InfoWars is doing that for you.
[03:41:16.243 --> 03:41:18.064]  And we're doing it for you in the Trends Journal.
[03:41:18.584 --> 03:41:20.826]  So again, stay very tuned to the markets.
[03:41:20.846 --> 03:41:22.466]  We're going to go to very critical times.
[03:41:22.987 --> 03:41:24.468]  Everything could change in a flash.
[03:41:25.388 --> 03:41:28.850]  And again, the flashpoint may be the Middle East war breaking out.
[03:41:29.170 --> 03:41:33.252]  Because if Iran attacks big time, again, you don't have to be good at math.
[03:41:34.133 --> 03:41:38.135]  91 million Iranians versus 9 million Israelis.
[03:41:38.495 --> 03:41:38.935]  Who wins?
[03:41:40.296 --> 03:41:41.016]  Everybody loses.
[03:41:41.536 --> 03:41:41.797]  We win.
[03:41:41.817 --> 03:41:42.397]  See you soon.
[03:41:53.447 --> 03:42:01.492]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements.
[03:42:02.472 --> 03:42:06.235]  Because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[03:42:06.695 --> 03:42:08.876]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[03:42:09.717 --> 03:42:15.140]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[03:42:16.201 --> 03:42:24.763]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[03:42:25.103 --> 03:42:26.963]  We had five companies making product for us.
[03:42:27.583 --> 03:42:32.084]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're InfoWars.
[03:42:32.785 --> 03:42:38.486]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[03:42:38.866 --> 03:42:41.366]  Not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[03:42:42.187 --> 03:42:43.687]  And they said, listen, you know
[03:42:44.912 --> 03:43:00.927]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[03:43:01.307 --> 03:43:07.974]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[03:43:08.988 --> 03:43:09.408]  I don't know.
[03:43:20.968 --> 03:43:29.072]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private-labeled from them before we're even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[03:43:29.152 --> 03:43:35.775]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[03:43:35.935 --> 03:43:38.416]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[03:43:38.596 --> 03:43:40.497]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[03:43:40.717 --> 03:43:50.503]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[03:43:51.123 --> 03:43:53.524]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[03:43:53.564 --> 03:43:54.625]  Take Turmeric 95.
[03:43:56.306 --> 03:44:03.008]  Turmeric 95 isn't called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[03:44:03.128 --> 03:44:08.770]  And it turns out that's the company years ago when I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[03:44:08.890 --> 03:44:17.413]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTore.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[03:44:17.453 --> 03:44:19.554]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[03:44:19.774 --> 03:44:19.894]  And
[03:44:21.164 --> 03:44:34.450]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[03:44:34.951 --> 03:44:39.333]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[03:44:39.393 --> 03:44:44.035]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[03:44:45.056 --> 03:44:50.299]  So, I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[03:44:50.399 --> 03:44:51.000]  It's amazing.
[03:44:51.120 --> 03:44:52.040]  It's super high quality.
[03:44:52.120 --> 03:44:53.962]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[03:45:14.155 --> 03:45:14.415]  Thank you.
