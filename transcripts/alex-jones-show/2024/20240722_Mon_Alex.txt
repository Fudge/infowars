[00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:06.927]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:08.188 --> 00:00:12.572]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and support the InfoWars.
[00:00:16.656 --> 00:00:18.077]  It's Monday, July 22nd, 2024.
[00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:25.885]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, The Forbidden Broadcast.
[00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.990]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.911]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:35.113 --> 00:00:39.957]  We are 105 days, 12 hours, 59 minutes, 37 seconds.
[00:00:40.738 --> 00:00:42.820]  The most important election in world history.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.505]  I told you two weeks ago that Biden would resign on the 20th or 21st.
[00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:52.407]  A lot of data went into that.
[00:00:52.748 --> 00:00:53.989]  We hit the target again.
[00:00:55.094 --> 00:01:02.036]  I told you they would try to assassinate Trump every day in the last year at one of his rallies.
[00:01:02.856 --> 00:01:03.336]  It happened.
[00:01:04.077 --> 00:01:07.558]  And now I'm going to tell you what I believe is coming next.
[00:01:08.298 --> 00:01:18.841]  But if people listen, which they are at record numbers, we're back to 2016, 2017, 30 million a day conservatively, conservatively listening to the show.
[00:01:21.084 --> 00:01:27.690]  If folks listen and people take action, we can stop the New World Order dead in its tracks.
[00:01:29.312 --> 00:01:32.074]  The point of these predictions is to get ahead of them and stop them.
[00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:34.276]  All right.
[00:01:35.998 --> 00:01:40.602]  Massive research I've done for this broadcast, and just every one of these stats is incredibly important.
[00:01:42.844 --> 00:01:43.605]  Let me just do this.
[00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:45.487]  Obviously, we've got Kamala.
[00:01:45.527 --> 00:01:50.457]   Will she be the one replacing Biden, will they reshuffle it?
[00:01:50.657 --> 00:02:00.406]  Try to put in Hillary or Newsom or Whitmer at the rigged dictatorial anti-democratic DNC in Chicago.
[00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:03.588]  Also even Fox News is saying, is Biden even alive?
[00:02:03.608 --> 00:02:05.150]  Hasn't been seen in four plus days.
[00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.072]  That's a whole controversy there.
[00:02:08.793 --> 00:02:10.995]  They're also attacking Trump saying he made donations to Harris.
[00:02:11.315 --> 00:02:12.296]  He's been public about that.
[00:02:12.316 --> 00:02:12.937]  We have the articles.
[00:02:14.724 --> 00:02:20.566]  He gave all the major Republican Democrats, as anybody would do that owns real estate around the country, if you don't, they shut you down.
[00:02:21.746 --> 00:02:30.449]  We've got that, we've got the big news, and I've talked to a consortium of top snipers, and we've got several of them coming on here today.
[00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:36.570]  Dallas Alexander with the longest shot in world history, 2.2 miles, with the Canadian Delta Force.
[00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.931]  He'll be joining us.
[00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:40.520]  Jay O'Neal.
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.921]  Don't need to tell you who that guy is.
[00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:44.502]  One of the most famous, if not most famous, Navy SEALs.
[00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:45.763]  He's coming on.
[00:02:45.783 --> 00:02:50.286]  And they say, bare minimum, deliberate negligence to get him killed.
[00:02:50.326 --> 00:02:55.449]  And they stood down, which is the same thing as murder one, because you knew it was happening.
[00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.011]  Or they deliberately did it as an inside job.
[00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:01.633]  And I talked to Dallas and O'Neal yesterday on the phone.
[00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:07.100]  Dallas just says it's an inside job and O'Neal leans that way.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.340]  These are the premier experts on this in the world.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.021]  So they're coming up today.
[00:03:13.041 --> 00:03:15.501]  And of course, the smoking gun.
[00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:17.441]  People are like, well, Trump probably told the Secret Service.
[00:03:17.461 --> 00:03:18.322]  He doesn't care if there's a threat.
[00:03:18.762 --> 00:03:19.582]  No, Trump's on record.
[00:03:19.602 --> 00:03:27.383]  We have the video coming up saying, if I'd have been told there was a potential shooter with a rangefinder running around, I'd have delayed my speech.
[00:03:27.863 --> 00:03:29.964]  They put that guy on the roof right when Trump went up.
[00:03:30.144 --> 00:03:31.284]  It was all coordinated.
[00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:31.964]  My God.
[00:03:33.578 --> 00:03:41.303]  When you walk up to a brand new automobile and hear it start, you get it and drive it, you think it just created itself in the sands of the Sahara by the sand blowing around in circles?
[00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:43.425]  You know, engineers built that.
[00:03:43.705 --> 00:03:44.666]  That was made in a factory.
[00:03:46.227 --> 00:03:48.868]  You see a kid walking down the street, that grew in some mother's belly.
[00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:55.012]  If you walk down the street and see somebody with their head cut off, it looks like a sword wound.
[00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:56.493]  You go, somebody cut that person's head off.
[00:03:58.315 --> 00:04:04.579]   You got the evil Secret Service puppet of Maine, working something to testify.
[00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:05.679]  We've got clips of that.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.080]  Totally ridiculous.
[00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:08.641]  Absolute crap.
[00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:09.882]  Total arrogance as usual.
[00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:17.007]  Then we've got all the military news, the economic news, the poison shot news.
[00:04:17.027 --> 00:04:19.629]  They're officially rolling out bird flu and COVID hysteria.
[00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:20.830]  Trying to have mail-in ballots again.
[00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:21.670]  Told you that was coming.
[00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:23.651]  You'd set your watch by this stuff.
[00:04:24.552 --> 00:04:25.553]  So we've got all of that.
[00:04:27.898 --> 00:04:34.324]  I've got all the inside baseball on Trump, and the people that I talk to at the highest levels don't mind if we say it because they want the enemy to know security's there.
[00:04:34.584 --> 00:04:41.391]  They're not going to specifically give us the details of it, but Eric Prince and his guys are being hired, all the former Delta Force people.
[00:04:42.072 --> 00:04:47.297]  They've already been brought in as of last Thursday, and so now Trump has security up the you-know-what.
[00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.374]  Except the real chick in the armor is poison, blow up his airplane, drone attacks, truck bomb attacks.
[00:04:54.734 --> 00:04:57.456]  We'll be talking about all of that on the other side.
[00:04:57.516 --> 00:05:03.540]  This is the show they want to keep from you, because if the people tune in, it's game over with the New World Order, because we got their number.
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.061]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:11.945]  Welcome to the Monday, July 22nd, 2024 edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:11.965 --> 00:05:17.169]  The Deep State fought hard to get off the air, but because of your support and prayer, we're still holding on.
[00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.210]  Oh, just barely.
[00:05:22.152 --> 00:05:25.894]  People are really gonna freak out in the next few months if we get shut down after all the desperate attempts.
[00:05:26.614 --> 00:05:29.336]  Because now it's just, people believe we'll always be here.
[00:05:29.356 --> 00:05:40.622]  But I gotta tell you, take every show as precious, take every clip as precious, take every archive as precious, because we've been doing important work together with our listeners and supporters and guests and researchers and crew and reporters.
[00:05:42.423 --> 00:05:42.763]  Okay.
[00:05:44.464 --> 00:05:46.425]  There is a total consensus formed.
[00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:51.823]  And it's happening in Congress, it's happening with security experts, it's happening with all the top snipers.
[00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:53.824]  We got a couple of them on today.
[00:05:54.965 --> 00:06:07.771]  That this was a total inside job and that the Secret Service stood down and they did not follow the default when there is a reported suspicious person running around with rangefinders and all this to delay his speech.
[00:06:08.611 --> 00:06:11.853]  And Trump has come out and said he would have delayed if he'd been told.
[00:06:12.825 --> 00:06:16.867]  Law enforcement notified Secret Service about shooter before assassination attempts.
[00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:19.729]  So why wasn't Trump immediately evacuated?
[00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:21.130]  And Trump has responded to that.
[00:06:22.391 --> 00:06:23.371]  We're going to hit that first.
[00:06:24.372 --> 00:06:37.760]  Then we have the man who's credited with the longest shot in history and in the Canadian Delta Force, Dallas Alexander, joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:06:38.527 --> 00:06:41.788]  And then Robert J. O'Neill, the most famous Navy SEAL.
[00:06:41.808 --> 00:06:43.228]  I don't need to introduce him.
[00:06:43.248 --> 00:06:47.989]  I talked to him as well, and he said, this has got Inside Job written all over it.
[00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:50.150]  He doesn't want to believe that, but that's what the evidence is.
[00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.870]  So that's just some of the people that will come on the air.
[00:06:53.730 --> 00:07:28.056]   I've talked to now, let's not exaggerate, 25 or more retired top operators, and I've talked to a bunch of other current people, And I've also talked to Jack Posobiec, who has spectacular sources, and they have told him the exact same thing, but also said, Alex, you're looking at the most important point, the encrypted phones, the offshore accounts, the drone being flown over, and the explosives found in his car and in his house.
[00:07:28.236 --> 00:07:40.159]   We're talking about crooks, the decoy, the Lee Harvey Oswald, the Tim McVeigh, Patsy, And they are professional explosives.
[00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:44.920]  So that right there, ladies and gentlemen, tells you a lot.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.060]  And the Deep State is going to make another run at Trump.
[00:07:49.921 --> 00:08:03.204]  I should have covered this yesterday because I confirmed this on Saturday, but I have talked to a high level people who were directly in the meetings with Trump, with Eric, with Don Jr.
[00:08:03.344 --> 00:08:09.278]   and with Trump's Campaign manager.
[00:08:11.318 --> 00:08:14.139]  And as of Wednesday and Thursday, Trump understands that's the deep state.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.540]  That's openly known.
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.241]  But obviously, he's not going to say that at this point.
[00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:20.162]  I think he should, but he's decided not to.
[00:08:21.582 --> 00:08:30.306]  And that they are bringing in outside security at the direction of Eric Prince.
[00:08:32.126 --> 00:08:32.847]  And Trump did that in 2016.
[00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:34.287]  He's doing it again.
[00:08:34.307 --> 00:08:35.268]  And that is the right move.
[00:08:35.308 --> 00:08:36.048]  That's the only move.
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:43.602]  They're getting all the JSOC Delta Force people.
[00:08:44.763 --> 00:08:56.266]  But Biden, obviously, he's gone now, but people controlling Biden won't give that to Trump, so Trump's paying for it from former Delta Force, Army Special Operations.
[00:08:56.747 --> 00:08:58.107]  But they're really just saying it's former.
[00:08:58.707 --> 00:09:00.348]  So that's what's going on.
[00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:05.546]  And that's good news that Trump knows the score and it's not naive.
[00:09:05.566 --> 00:09:06.987]  Of course, you would expect him to be naive.
[00:09:07.448 --> 00:09:34.182]   And I have told Trump through his people that he needs to take this very seriously, which he is, and that he's already won, so don't take any unnecessary Actions that put yourself in harm's way.
[00:09:34.842 --> 00:09:37.224]  The consensus is poison will be their next move.
[00:09:37.985 --> 00:09:44.710]  And I said this last week, I said they'll probably debilitate Biden because he's refusing to step down and drug him up so much.
[00:09:46.151 --> 00:09:49.993]  He's already controlled by these doctors that he just disappears for a while.
[00:09:50.113 --> 00:09:52.355]  So they might even kill him, claim he died in his sleep.
[00:09:52.875 --> 00:09:54.216]  That's a huge new controversy.
[00:09:54.256 --> 00:09:55.917]  Fox News is saying, is he dead?
[00:09:57.939 --> 00:09:58.780]  I'm not saying that.
[00:09:59.773 --> 00:10:00.873]  Proof of life, please.
[00:10:00.953 --> 00:10:05.994]  Fox host asked if Biden event, if Biden is even still alive.
[00:10:06.594 --> 00:10:09.075]  Fox News host asked, is Biden even still alive?
[00:10:09.115 --> 00:10:15.416]  So, and his resignation letter from the campaign, he's trying to stay in as president.
[00:10:15.456 --> 00:10:17.676]  I think they made 25th Amendment him just to get full power down.
[00:10:17.696 --> 00:10:18.876]  People don't control him.
[00:10:22.957 --> 00:10:27.098]  It's not on the presidential letterhead and the signatures are not even close.
[00:10:28.778 --> 00:10:29.538]  Doesn't look good.
[00:10:31.983 --> 00:10:33.464]  That was seen in four and a half days.
[00:10:35.506 --> 00:10:43.333]  So there is a lot going on as the deep state fights with itself over control of their system.
[00:10:44.034 --> 00:10:49.919]  And then they go to battle with us, the American people, through the electoral system, trying to get our man in, turn America around.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.002]  So they've got multiple fights with each other internally over power.
[00:10:53.914 --> 00:10:58.495]  And they've got fights with us once they decide who they're going to try to put in.
[00:10:59.096 --> 00:11:09.679]  But all this talk about Trump being a dictator and Trump being anti-democratic and he followed the entire process constitutionally and won despite all their attacks and all their lawfare and all their indictments and fake convictions.
[00:11:09.699 --> 00:11:17.621]  And they're like, oh, we'll just have some type of event in Chicago in a few weeks and we'll just choose who it's going to be.
[00:11:18.562 --> 00:11:22.803]  Though they're saying it's Kamala and the Clintons and others have saluted her.
[00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:25.690]  Obama hasn't.
[00:11:28.591 --> 00:11:31.312]  And so that tells you that the fighting's still going on.
[00:11:31.752 --> 00:11:41.494]  And Hillary wouldn't have all these hundreds, I couldn't even keep track of them, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, about she had the popular vote, and she's the smartest, and she deserves it.
[00:11:41.934 --> 00:12:07.883]   So don't think they won't try to push Kamala out and put her in, or have Kamala, who's dumber than a box of rocks, she's basically a fleshlight, Put Hillary on as her VP and boy if she does that she's gonna get JFK'd very very fast so the mindless hyena
[00:12:09.975 --> 00:12:15.180]  Is being positioned, because she's the type of puppet they like, but some of the donor class don't want that.
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.104]  So this is a spectacular Democrat deep state civil war in amongst themselves.
[00:12:19.444 --> 00:12:21.826]  They were hoping for a civil war with the American people and a race war.
[00:12:22.087 --> 00:12:25.210]  They sure worked on it hard, but that hasn't materialized.
[00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:29.814]  As God says many times in the Bible, your enemy will dig a pit for you, but they will fall into it.
[00:12:31.896 --> 00:12:32.857]  And that's where we are.
[00:12:33.905 --> 00:12:34.725]  I forget the exact quote.
[00:12:34.745 --> 00:12:35.606]  Guys, type in the Bible.
[00:12:35.666 --> 00:12:36.246]  Bible verse.
[00:12:36.726 --> 00:12:38.827]  Your enemy will dig a pit for you and they will fall into it.
[00:12:38.847 --> 00:12:40.707]  I forget the exact verbiage.
[00:12:40.747 --> 00:12:43.568]  It's more eloquent than what I just butchered it as.
[00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:47.670]  But at the end of the day, Frederick Nietzsche is right.
[00:12:50.396 --> 00:12:52.697]  That which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:12:52.877 --> 00:12:56.159]  We're getting stronger as populist Americans of every race, color, and creed.
[00:12:56.539 --> 00:12:57.500]  We're getting more informed.
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.560]  We're getting more dialed in.
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.982]  People are really not being naive anymore and facing the facts.
[00:13:02.002 --> 00:13:03.243]  I mean, I can't tell you.
[00:13:03.543 --> 00:13:06.304]  This is about me personally, but I'm a gauge, like a sensor.
[00:13:08.765 --> 00:13:14.828]  Those that dig in the pit shall fall therein, and he that rolleth a stone, it will remain upon him.
[00:13:16.989 --> 00:13:19.831]  So they set booby traps for themselves and blow themselves up most of the time.
[00:13:21.237 --> 00:13:33.605]  But I'm getting nothing but good feedback from the top of the Trump Organization, nothing but good feedback from the Republican establishment, nothing but good feedback from the grassroots and all the major commentators.
[00:13:34.326 --> 00:13:39.089]  And it's actually crazy now when I talk to these people, because I'm not looking for that.
[00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:41.991]  I don't want to wear tuxedos and hang out at balls and be part of their system.
[00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:44.933]  I just want to live my life and fight tyranny.
[00:13:48.195 --> 00:13:51.080]   But these people, when I talk to them, say, Yes, sir.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:51.521]  Yes, sir.
[00:13:51.561 --> 00:13:52.582]  What do you think, sir?
[00:13:53.222 --> 00:13:54.343]  Not been called sir.
[00:13:57.786 --> 00:13:59.387]  And I've had Trump say, oh, you're amazing.
[00:13:59.427 --> 00:14:00.108]  You're a real man.
[00:14:00.128 --> 00:14:01.049]  We really appreciate it.
[00:14:01.089 --> 00:14:02.310]  He does that to a lot of folks.
[00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.111]  That's kind of like, oh, thank you.
[00:14:04.131 --> 00:14:06.473]  I want to warn you about the deep state inside your administration.
[00:14:06.493 --> 00:14:08.855]  He's like, well, you know, none of that now.
[00:14:08.915 --> 00:14:10.016]  It's like, OK, what do you think?
[00:14:10.457 --> 00:14:11.097]  Well, thank you, sir.
[00:14:11.137 --> 00:14:12.719]  Well, we're going to look into that immediately.
[00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:14.180]  OK, well.
[00:14:15.811 --> 00:14:17.832]  70-year-old men are saying, what do we do, sir?
[00:14:17.872 --> 00:14:18.353]  Yes, sir.
[00:14:18.373 --> 00:14:19.053]  You're like, okay.
[00:14:19.073 --> 00:14:21.855]  And you know, special operations commanders, current, former.
[00:14:21.895 --> 00:14:22.235]  Yes, sir.
[00:14:22.255 --> 00:14:22.815]  What do we do, sir?
[00:14:23.676 --> 00:14:34.543]  It's not about that, but it's about people recognizing this broadcast has got its finger on the pulse because of God, not because of me, because of the guests and the crew and being immersed in this.
[00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:35.423]  This is what I do.
[00:14:35.464 --> 00:14:36.224]  This is all I do.
[00:14:37.625 --> 00:14:39.026]  They've got to do all these other things.
[00:14:39.086 --> 00:14:39.406]  I get it.
[00:14:39.786 --> 00:14:40.607]  This is what I do.
[00:14:42.352 --> 00:14:51.877]  So when I give you my take on things, it's our best case scenario, worst case scenario analysis and getting inside the enemy's mind and seeing what the pre-programming is and understanding it.
[00:14:52.177 --> 00:14:58.941]  It doesn't mean I'm always right because they've gone from saying Alex Jones was right to Alex Jones is always right.
[00:14:59.041 --> 00:15:00.002]  I am not always right.
[00:15:03.003 --> 00:15:06.225]  Because that itself is a false statement.
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:12.141]  I'm trying to say what is the probability and what I think the enemy's next move is.
[00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:23.583]  They may change their mind when we put pressure on them or other things happen, but I'm trying to say, statistically, knowing how they operate and looking at their pre-programming, what do we think their next move will be?
[00:15:23.843 --> 00:15:25.803]  That does not mean it's guaranteed.
[00:15:27.303 --> 00:15:33.284]  It does not mean that I am Paul Atreides in Dune who's psychic.
[00:15:33.624 --> 00:15:34.865]  We all have the touch.
[00:15:34.885 --> 00:15:35.745]  We all have the discernment.
[00:15:36.005 --> 00:15:42.512]   God gives us, you know, ideas but we can change the future.
[00:15:42.512 --> 00:15:46.512]   So it isn't like when I say Hillary will be the nominee or Hillary will try to be the nominee.
[00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:49.152]  She's trying. We're seeing that's going on.
[00:15:49.152 --> 00:15:55.032]   Or when I say, you know, the way this is going, I think he's jockeying behind the scenes for deals for his family.
[00:15:55.032 --> 00:15:59.432]  I think it will announce within two weeks he's gone.
[00:15:59.432 --> 00:16:06.272]   And if his family comes out and defends him and defends the stepping down, that means they've been paid off.
[00:16:06.363 --> 00:16:12.186]  And I was just looking at the timeline and guessing it'd be a weekend, so I pulled a calendar up and I said, okay, two weeks is the 20th and 21st.
[00:16:12.707 --> 00:16:13.447]  He'll step down then.
[00:16:13.727 --> 00:16:13.987]  He did!
[00:16:14.007 --> 00:16:15.448]  People are like, how the hell did you know that?
[00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.870]  It's immersion.
[00:16:20.852 --> 00:16:21.272]  That's how.
[00:16:22.873 --> 00:16:25.014]  It's constantly researching all this.
[00:16:25.134 --> 00:16:29.157]  So let me give you an immersion statement that is really not even hard to know.
[00:16:30.196 --> 00:16:40.939]  I mean, this is not... If the deep state's so desperate, and Trump's really 30 points ahead in national polls, 20 points ahead in battleground states, they're skewed polls 10 points ahead, 15 points ahead.
[00:16:42.099 --> 00:16:47.881]  If they were willing to kill him before, and now he's even more popular, they wanted to kill him because he was popular.
[00:16:48.361 --> 00:16:52.042]  Well, they want to kill him now that he's 10 times more popular around the world.
[00:16:52.062 --> 00:16:54.043]  A lot of folks are still bullied, don't want to admit it.
[00:16:54.443 --> 00:16:58.144]  Trump has reached rock star status that we've not seen in hundreds of years.
[00:17:00.509 --> 00:17:01.369]  No, they're gonna kill it.
[00:17:01.489 --> 00:17:02.249]  They're gonna try to kill it.
[00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:03.930]  I don't want to speak it into existence.
[00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:09.291]  I'm saying they, on their current trajectory, their current plan, it is a no-brainer.
[00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:11.612]  Somebody with an 80 IQ should know that.
[00:17:12.112 --> 00:17:15.913]  Then we gotta ask, when we have bigger IQs, when will they do it, how will they do it?
[00:17:15.973 --> 00:17:17.333]  And there's a lot of different angles to that.
[00:17:17.913 --> 00:17:20.134]  And they're so desperate, the answer is any way they can.
[00:17:21.914 --> 00:17:25.795]  Any way you want it, that's the way you need it, any way you want it.
[00:17:26.533 --> 00:17:28.974]  Well, this is any way they can get it.
[00:17:29.694 --> 00:17:32.194]  Any way you can get it, any way you can get it done.
[00:17:32.794 --> 00:17:34.115]  That's where we are.
[00:17:34.255 --> 00:17:59.567]   So, there's this celebration going on, everybody thinks we're winning, everybody thinks we're invincible, and then the establishment CIA mouthpiece, Atlantic Monthly, comes out last night, I think it's put on the top of Drudge, that, oh, the Republicans think they've won, and they're so arrogant, and they've taken the hill, But as Von Clywood said, that's when you're in the greatest danger.
[00:17:59.486 --> 00:18:04.125]   And that's what I've been saying for nine days since they tried this.
[00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:08.806]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:18:08.956 --> 00:18:09.557]  Here's the headline.
[00:18:09.597 --> 00:18:11.358]  The Trump campaign has peaked too soon.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.222]  The real headline should be, we're gonna make another run at Trump.
[00:18:18.785 --> 00:18:37.353]   But any football team can tell you, you might be 20-something points ahead to zero when you go to halftime and you come out after halftime and you think you won and the other team kicks your ass and beats you by 14 points.
[00:18:39.354 --> 00:18:41.835]  And I can tell you behind the scenes Trump does not have that attitude.
[00:18:42.876 --> 00:18:43.836]  There's got to be a balance though.
[00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:48.118]  He's going to rampage around more campaigning than ever because he knows that.
[00:18:49.699 --> 00:18:53.841]  But then you've also got to balance it that they can kill you when you're doing that so there's got to be some balance.
[00:18:55.947 --> 00:19:06.915]  But the enemy is licking their lips and saying, don't worry, just like Victoria Nuland said a month and a half ago, she said, don't worry, Trump will never be president.
[00:19:06.955 --> 00:19:09.116]  We've got a nasty surprise for him.
[00:19:10.117 --> 00:19:11.838]  Oh, nasty surprise.
[00:19:15.461 --> 00:19:18.423]  A nasty surprise for Trump.
[00:19:18.443 --> 00:19:22.285]  All right, so.
[00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:30.756]  I could easily sit here and do the whole show airing you clips of the idiot, puppet, Secret Service boss, Cheadle.
[00:19:32.096 --> 00:19:34.737]  We got some of that, but that's red meat.
[00:19:34.917 --> 00:19:35.377]  Okay, great.
[00:19:37.418 --> 00:19:42.980]  We're trying to go past just that and actually affect the future and stop the tyrants, not just have an entertaining show.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.222]   So I'll play some clips of it because they're important, but debating why they were incompetent No.
[00:19:52.863 --> 00:19:59.688]  You begin with deliberate incompetence and not giving him one-tenth of the protection he needed, and that's where it starts.
[00:19:59.748 --> 00:20:01.569]  You don't debate whether it was incompetence.
[00:20:02.129 --> 00:20:12.317]  It's gross, deliberate incompetence, gross negligence, criminal negligence, and then you start from there and it just goes to inside job, shut up, then protecting the shooter the whole nine yards.
[00:20:13.918 --> 00:20:14.599]  And that's the facts.
[00:20:15.359 --> 00:20:28.039]   And I have said for nine days, and I'll say it again, The CIA Atlantic Monthly article says, hopefully people just forget about the shooting and it goes away.
[00:20:28.059 --> 00:20:29.159]  They've got such short memories.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.641]  This is the establishment talking to itself.
[00:20:33.382 --> 00:20:36.384]  Like you have lobotomies or you're a three-year-old.
[00:20:39.125 --> 00:20:40.906]  Well, how does Trump not let them forget?
[00:20:41.447 --> 00:20:48.271]  He attacks Mayorkas, he attacks Cheadle, he attacks Biden, he attacks the deep state, he talks about JFK.
[00:20:49.758 --> 00:20:56.221]  And he starts talking about the other snipers and the other shooters, and he starts talking about why did the Secret Service stand down for all that time.
[00:20:56.781 --> 00:21:02.503]  I'll tell you, I did not like it when he got up there at the RNC and said how great the Secret Service is and what heroes they are.
[00:21:02.724 --> 00:21:10.647]  Yeah, the folks that ran up immediately to protect him, they're good men and women, even though some of them can't holster their guns, they're good.
[00:21:10.667 --> 00:21:13.088]  You can delineate that.
[00:21:14.108 --> 00:21:15.269]  But this is not good.
[00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:23.795]  And so he has to make the campaign about how they're trying to kill me, that's Trump, because I'm standing in the way of them getting to you, which is true!
[00:21:25.496 --> 00:21:30.400]  And it sounds crazy to have a presidential candidate come out and say, yeah, the deep sea tried to kill me, but that's what they did!
[00:21:31.461 --> 00:21:33.182]  And they killed Kennedy and they tried to kill Reagan.
[00:21:33.483 --> 00:21:37.946]  So if you don't come out and hammer their ass, that's a big mistake.
[00:21:38.927 --> 00:21:40.709]  But don't worry, your surrogates will do it.
[00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.552]  And they knew I'd do it day one, that's why they wanted me off the air six weeks ago.
[00:21:45.802 --> 00:21:46.923]  And all the rest of us will.
[00:21:48.145 --> 00:21:49.426]  And all these other experts will.
[00:21:50.487 --> 00:21:51.548]  But we need Trump to do it.
[00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:52.709]  That is a no-brainer.
[00:21:55.773 --> 00:22:01.279]  And... Trump's gotten irritated with me.
[00:22:01.439 --> 00:22:04.042]  I mean, at the time, he called up my wife, found out we got married.
[00:22:04.482 --> 00:22:06.705]  He talks to her for like 10 minutes, and I grabbed the phone away.
[00:22:07.654 --> 00:22:09.155]  Because he called my number and I gave it to him.
[00:22:09.175 --> 00:22:09.795]  I talked to your wife.
[00:22:10.476 --> 00:22:12.697]  And I said, listen, you got people inside your operation.
[00:22:12.717 --> 00:22:13.617]  Let me tell you who they are.
[00:22:13.998 --> 00:22:14.798]  I told you a month ago.
[00:22:15.278 --> 00:22:15.979]  Alex, come on.
[00:22:16.039 --> 00:22:16.939]  Hey, you're a great guy.
[00:22:16.979 --> 00:22:17.580]  Hey, let's get him.
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:18.540]  Come see me sometime.
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.882]  I'm like, listen, they got people in there.
[00:22:20.902 --> 00:22:21.662]  You got to get rid of them.
[00:22:21.962 --> 00:22:22.943]  They're trying to take you out.
[00:22:23.003 --> 00:22:23.723]  Now he knows that.
[00:22:24.244 --> 00:22:25.564]  He's like, OK, Alex, I got to go.
[00:22:26.305 --> 00:22:26.565]  Click.
[00:22:27.405 --> 00:22:29.787]  Because I don't want to sit there and be told how great I am.
[00:22:30.087 --> 00:22:31.328]  I want to stop these people.
[00:22:31.568 --> 00:22:32.829]  And I want him to listen to me.
[00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:42.816]   Nothing against my wife, but God Almighty, I don't have a chance to talk to the President.
[00:22:42.936 --> 00:22:44.158]  I'm going to tell him what's going on.
[00:22:45.114 --> 00:22:50.196]  And the next time he called me with something like that, I said, OK, can we stop talking about... I don't... I support you.
[00:22:50.496 --> 00:22:51.356]  I don't need to hear it.
[00:22:51.396 --> 00:22:52.076]  Other people want that.
[00:22:52.096 --> 00:22:53.777]  They want to have him sit there and pet him.
[00:22:53.837 --> 00:22:55.178]  And I'm not a lapdog.
[00:22:55.278 --> 00:22:56.778]  I'm not here trying to be petted on.
[00:22:57.118 --> 00:22:59.699]  I want to stop him from killing you because they're going to get me next, OK?
[00:23:00.639 --> 00:23:02.040]  I'm very self-centered in this.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.280]  I know the New World Order is pure evil.
[00:23:03.561 --> 00:23:05.101]  I know you don't want to depopulate the planet.
[00:23:05.381 --> 00:23:06.281]  I know you're a good guy.
[00:23:06.702 --> 00:23:07.642]  So I back you.
[00:23:08.522 --> 00:23:10.403]  And I want you to get hardcore, which he is now.
[00:23:11.063 --> 00:23:12.784]  And that's why they are so panicked.
[00:23:13.524 --> 00:23:14.906]  That's why they're so cross-eyed.
[00:23:14.926 --> 00:23:16.048]  That's why they're so crazy.
[00:23:16.929 --> 00:23:18.091]  Let's go to the clip of Trump.
[00:23:18.111 --> 00:23:19.053]  This is what he needs to be doing.
[00:23:19.073 --> 00:23:19.433]  He did it.
[00:23:20.635 --> 00:23:24.421]  Saying that he obviously would have stayed off the stage if he'd been warned.
[00:23:24.441 --> 00:23:24.721]  Here it is.
[00:23:25.572 --> 00:23:28.373]  You were monitoring this guy for an hour beforehand.
[00:23:28.393 --> 00:23:28.574]  Yeah.
[00:23:28.854 --> 00:23:31.255]  No one told you not to take the stage?
[00:23:31.415 --> 00:23:32.456]  No, nobody mentioned it.
[00:23:32.496 --> 00:23:33.796]  Nobody said there was a problem.
[00:23:34.677 --> 00:23:35.957]  And I would have waited for 15.
[00:23:36.218 --> 00:23:40.440]  They could have said, let's wait for 15 minutes, 20 minutes, five minutes, something.
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.961]  Nobody said, I think that was a mistake.
[00:23:43.341 --> 00:23:44.962]  How did somebody get on that roof?
[00:23:45.082 --> 00:23:46.543]  And why wasn't he reported?
[00:23:46.603 --> 00:23:48.264]  Because people saw that he was on the roof.
[00:23:48.284 --> 00:23:52.406]   I mean, you had Trumpers screaming.
[00:23:53.046 --> 00:23:56.968]  The woman in the red shirt, she was screaming.
[00:23:56.988 --> 00:23:58.028]  There's a man on the roof.
[00:23:58.108 --> 00:24:01.150]  And then other people said, there's a man on the roof who's got a gun.
[00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:05.632]  And that was quite a bit before I walked onto the stage.
[00:24:06.072 --> 00:24:08.633]  So you would have thought somebody would have done something about it.
[00:24:09.329 --> 00:24:15.634]  Former President Trump saying for the first time, exclusively to Jesse Watters Prime Time, that no one warned him not to take the stage.
[00:24:15.694 --> 00:24:18.317]  Even though they knew it was a threat, there was a threat.
[00:24:18.517 --> 00:24:21.159]  And it was this guy, almost an hour beforehand.
[00:24:21.539 --> 00:24:23.281]  The Secret Service under mounting pressure.
[00:24:23.661 --> 00:24:26.684]  Pressure following the assassination attempt of former President Trump on Saturday.
[00:24:27.144 --> 00:24:29.867]  One week later, we still have very few answers about the shooter.
[00:24:30.507 --> 00:24:34.308]  The motive and the stunning security lapses, something we have learned.
[00:24:34.328 --> 00:24:43.591]  20-year-old Thomas Crooks likely flew a drone over the fairgrounds in Butler, Pennsylvania, just hours before Trump took the stage in front of tens of thousands of people.
[00:24:43.651 --> 00:24:49.873]  Officials say the predetermined path suggests Crooks flew the drone more than once to scope out the event site.
[00:24:50.433 --> 00:24:57.955]  At least four congressional committees are planning to probe the security failures that allowed him to gain access to the nearby rooftop that he fired from.
[00:24:58.675 --> 00:25:03.019]  Republican Senator Josh Hawley says he's heard from multiple whistleblowers.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:11.365]  The idea that you could have all of this time elapsed and nobody notices, no law enforcement notices he's on the roof.
[00:25:11.565 --> 00:25:17.570]  Whistleblowers tell me that law enforcement were actually on different channels, different radio communication channels.
[00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:20.432]  There were multiple different channels and they weren't coordinated.
[00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:21.974]  We need answers.
[00:25:22.114 --> 00:25:26.137]  The director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheadle, expected to face tough questions when she testified.
[00:25:26.564 --> 00:25:27.484]  And that's how I'm going.
[00:25:27.544 --> 00:25:29.205]  Cheadle's being grilled right now.
[00:25:30.205 --> 00:25:32.006]  The Democrats are now making it about gun control.
[00:25:32.386 --> 00:25:32.986]  God Almighty.
[00:25:34.207 --> 00:25:40.089]  So, Howley then tried to go to the site, and he got kicked off by the Feds.
[00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:42.710]  They're in a cover-up.
[00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:47.171]  We've got an expert coming on with the longest sniper shot in history next segment.
[00:25:48.191 --> 00:25:49.372]  I'm going to break, but listen to me.

[00:27:08.442 --> 00:27:11.564]  I want to thank you all that have been supportive.
[00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:18.064]   Alright, Dallas Alexander, former Special Operations Equivalent of Delta Force in Canada,
[00:27:18.064 --> 00:27:20.384]  credited with his team, one of the longest shot in history.
[00:27:20.384 --> 00:27:22.544]  He's going to give us analysis straight ahead.
[00:27:22.544 --> 00:27:26.903]   I talked to him yesterday and he concurred with all the other experts I talked to and
[00:27:26.903 --> 00:27:31.343]   basically, well, he said, "I'll tell you what he told me on the other side.
[00:27:31.343 --> 00:27:32.343]  Please stay with us."
[00:27:32.343 --> 00:27:37.383]   So, there's the InfoWars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest
[00:27:38.024 --> 00:27:45.409]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's salt palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[00:27:45.829 --> 00:27:49.471]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[00:27:49.491 --> 00:27:50.832]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[00:27:50.852 --> 00:28:00.878]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWars MD.
[00:28:02.631 --> 00:28:04.092]  Ryder is on the storm.
[00:28:05.933 --> 00:28:06.253]  All right.
[00:28:06.473 --> 00:28:10.955]  So in the last nine days, I made a lot of phone calls, talked to a lot of people.
[00:28:11.835 --> 00:28:20.019]  And then on Friday and Saturday, I was able to talk to the folks, I'm going to leave it at that, off record, that met with Trump and the Trump group.
[00:28:20.882 --> 00:28:23.504]  And with Eric Trump and Don Jr.
[00:28:24.064 --> 00:28:28.206]  on Wednesday and Thursday to get their take, to understand how serious the threat was.
[00:28:28.226 --> 00:28:30.487]  And they said, yes, we know now we're bringing in Eric Prince.
[00:28:30.988 --> 00:28:32.989]  We're bringing in a bunch of former Delta Force people.
[00:28:33.925 --> 00:28:34.565]  We understand.
[00:28:34.605 --> 00:28:35.186]  Trump knows.
[00:28:35.206 --> 00:28:38.107]  And now Trump's come out and said, clearly, Secret Service, stand down.
[00:28:38.127 --> 00:28:38.927]  They didn't tell him.
[00:28:38.947 --> 00:28:40.528]  We just played the club last segment.
[00:28:41.089 --> 00:28:44.690]  He wouldn't have got on stage if he knew there was a guy out there running around with a rangefinder and the rest of it.
[00:28:45.291 --> 00:28:46.331]  So he was totally protected.
[00:28:46.551 --> 00:28:47.332]  26 minutes on the roof.
[00:28:47.772 --> 00:28:50.593]  I'm not a sniper, but I cover the news for 30 years.
[00:28:50.673 --> 00:28:51.854]  I've had tons of snipers on.
[00:28:51.894 --> 00:28:52.794]  I'm a gun enthusiast.
[00:28:53.575 --> 00:28:54.495]  And I understand this.
[00:28:54.535 --> 00:28:59.918]  And I've talked to all these snipers I know, many of them very well known, and they confirm.
[00:29:01.144 --> 00:29:08.109]  So I'm talking to the folks at the Trump campaign and they said, well, obviously we can't have current people on or people inside the operation.
[00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:09.471]  But they said, here's what we recommend.
[00:29:10.571 --> 00:29:17.897]  And one of the folks they recommended has, with his team, the longest shot in history, over two miles.
[00:29:19.338 --> 00:29:23.061]  And he's also now a popular country music singer, Dallas Alexander.
[00:29:24.162 --> 00:29:27.064]  He's a family man and recently retired special operations sniper.
[00:29:27.184 --> 00:29:37.787]   He was part of the JTF2 Tier 1 Canadian comparison of Delta Force SEAL Team 6 which takes includes close personal protection for VIPs up to including the Prime Minister.
[00:29:38.147 --> 00:29:48.330]  His four-man sniper team broke the world record for the longest confirmed sniper kill in history in Mosul in Iraq 2017 where he shot the terrorist at 2.2 miles.
[00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:53.432]  There's famous video now out of that and that is a 9.9 second flight time.
[00:29:56.243 --> 00:29:58.544]  He is now a country music inspired singer and songwriter.
[00:29:58.584 --> 00:30:04.088]  He's breaking into the country music scene very successfully with a sound somewhere between Red Dirt and Outlaw.
[00:30:04.108 --> 00:30:06.209]  I love Outlaw and Red Dirt.
[00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:09.291]  DallasAlexander.ca.
[00:30:10.231 --> 00:30:12.893]  And so he joins us now coming up.
[00:30:14.053 --> 00:30:21.700]  In the third hour, Robert J. O'Neill, also a very famous special operator from SEAL Team 6, is going to be joining us.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.041]  I talked to him yesterday to give his take.
[00:30:23.061 --> 00:30:26.644]  It's very similar to Dallas Alexander.
[00:30:26.964 --> 00:30:28.425]  So Dallas, great to have you.
[00:30:28.465 --> 00:30:29.786]  We talked some yesterday.
[00:30:29.806 --> 00:30:33.329]  If you could just repeat what you told me and then add anything else to it.
[00:30:33.409 --> 00:30:35.791]  And of course, you've been picked up in the news early on.
[00:30:35.831 --> 00:30:36.492]  You had questions.
[00:30:36.532 --> 00:30:37.613]  Now you're really sure about it.
[00:30:38.093 --> 00:30:42.957]   Veteran, Who's team holds the world record for longest confirmed sniper kill weighs in on Trump assassination.
[00:30:43.317 --> 00:30:48.160]  A huge, big, thick, 18-page Daily Mail article about that.
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.281]  We can do an overhead shot, please.
[00:30:50.822 --> 00:30:52.423]  Here is that article for you right there.
[00:30:53.684 --> 00:30:55.806]  And more on that Joint Task Force 2.
[00:30:57.527 --> 00:31:02.410]  And sniper kill shot video was released after consultation with ex-JTF2 member.
[00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.992]  We're gonna get that up for you as well.
[00:31:06.113 --> 00:31:06.273]  So...
[00:31:07.324 --> 00:31:09.266]  We really appreciate you joining us, sir.
[00:31:09.946 --> 00:31:15.852]  And I know you don't need to have the courage, but other folks were like, well, we can't do it, but you should have Dallas on.
[00:31:15.872 --> 00:31:18.294]  So you've got the courage to come on and talk about this.
[00:31:18.354 --> 00:31:19.335]  We really appreciate you.
[00:31:19.875 --> 00:31:20.956]  So just start at the beginning.
[00:31:20.976 --> 00:31:23.038]  When you learned this happened, you saw the video.
[00:31:23.538 --> 00:31:24.079]  What did you think?
[00:31:26.641 --> 00:31:30.845]  Yeah, like when we spoke yesterday, I was actually down in Nashville when this happened.
[00:31:30.865 --> 00:31:57.218]   I was just out at a restaurant and It was it kept flashing onto the screen and I was kind of just reading it in the background and as soon as they showed the layout and where the buildings were and where they they said the shooter was the first two things that stood out to me were that building and the water tower and being the most obvious positions there that you know if you were assessing that from a security standpoint that would be immediately what you would look at.
[00:31:57.238 --> 00:32:07.222]   So see you told me yesterday that you instantly We're like, the default is be on that water tower, be on that roof, and there's nobody there.
[00:32:09.783 --> 00:32:10.583]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:32:11.404 --> 00:32:12.164]  And there was nobody there.
[00:32:12.484 --> 00:32:22.968]  So, just seeing that, my initial reaction, and instantly, this was within probably half a second, I was like, there's no way that this 20-year-old kid did this all by himself.
[00:32:25.289 --> 00:32:26.210]  I mean, elaborate on this.
[00:32:27.759 --> 00:32:39.322]  Well, I just think it's absurd to think that, you know, you watch all the videos and, you know, I say tactical professionals, be it police, SWAT, Secret Service, whatever it is, there were tactical professionals everywhere.
[00:32:40.043 --> 00:32:47.805]  And now I know level of competency differs greatly in tactical professions, but it doesn't really matter.
[00:32:47.845 --> 00:32:55.167]  I think a 10-year-old who plays Call of Duty or Fortnite would tell you if they were doing the security assessment that those two places needed to be watched.
[00:32:55.871 --> 00:33:04.559]  I think it's just so obvious to have a kid wandering around like this, a rifle on a roof within, what was it, 150 yards?
[00:33:05.339 --> 00:33:07.902]  Like, you could zero your rifle at that range.
[00:33:08.242 --> 00:33:09.043]  It's ridiculous.
[00:33:12.426 --> 00:33:18.271]  So going from there, Trump has now come out and said that they knew he was out there for 20-something minutes.
[00:33:18.971 --> 00:33:21.274]  And they still told Trump to go out.
[00:33:22.908 --> 00:33:25.610]  And then now the Secret Service had testified today.
[00:33:26.131 --> 00:33:26.791]  We have the club.
[00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:30.274]  She said, first it was too sloped.
[00:33:30.334 --> 00:33:31.295]  The roof's barely even sloped.
[00:33:31.315 --> 00:33:31.856]  What a joke.
[00:33:32.836 --> 00:33:34.238]  In fact, it's the weakest slope I've ever seen on a building.
[00:33:34.258 --> 00:33:36.339]  There's barely even a slope just for the rain to run off.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:45.407]  And then she basically admits all of this, that they decided not to put somebody on the roof.
[00:33:45.987 --> 00:33:47.769]  I mean, that is just insane.
[00:33:49.406 --> 00:34:00.929]  Yeah, I think like initially my feelings were there's no way he did this on his own, just in the fact that I thought at first someone, you know, turned a blind eye or something to get him into position because it was the most obvious thing.
[00:34:00.969 --> 00:34:06.530]  But it's almost like the more information comes out, you wonder how many more people were involved with it.
[00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:09.331]  It just, it seems so ridiculous.
[00:34:10.391 --> 00:34:11.431]  You know, the slope of the roof.
[00:34:11.911 --> 00:34:13.412]  I mean, you can tell from all the pictures.
[00:34:14.702 --> 00:34:18.964]  That it wasn't a threatening slope to stand on that was just absurd.
[00:34:20.684 --> 00:34:46.684]   So just the more information that comes out it seems almost like there's some different groups and agencies continue to put their own foot in their mouth with when really my initial assessment was just I don't think that he did it alone because I've done security and I've done close protection plan things like this you know in countries like Afghanistan or Iraq and it's These are just the basics, the very, very basics.
[00:34:47.164 --> 00:34:50.286]  Like a rooftop within 150 yards.
[00:34:50.766 --> 00:34:51.066]  Come on.
[00:34:51.486 --> 00:34:53.707]  A water tower close enough that it overlooks everything.
[00:34:54.228 --> 00:34:54.548]  Come on.
[00:34:55.548 --> 00:34:58.270]  So you're saying the default procedures were turned off?
[00:35:01.031 --> 00:35:02.051]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:35:02.091 --> 00:35:11.236]  Well, I feel like they're admitting that now, but I think there's a big push to blame it on incompetence versus something a little more suspicious, in my opinion.
[00:35:13.584 --> 00:35:18.648]  And then we don't have any press conferences, and they're all basically silent, and they're trying to keep U.S.
[00:35:18.688 --> 00:35:19.628]  Senators off the side.
[00:35:19.668 --> 00:35:20.249]  What do you make of that?
[00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:28.034]  Yeah, that's just another thing, like, it's another one of these, you know, post-event, it just adds to the suspicion.
[00:35:28.394 --> 00:35:45.481]   It's my initial feelings I had, I posted, but, you know, now that more and more comes out, and time passes, and like you said, the conferences that aren't happening, and the right explanations that aren't happening, It just adds to the suspicion, and I think rightfully so.
[00:35:45.562 --> 00:35:48.063]  I think it's a bit of a scramble happening right now.
[00:35:50.025 --> 00:35:57.311]  Well, Cheadle reported today, and we have the clip in a moment, that, okay, we found him with a rangefinder, not a prohibited item.
[00:35:57.351 --> 00:36:01.474]  So he's wandering around the bottom of a building, there's video of this.
[00:36:01.774 --> 00:36:04.396]  People go questioning, the local police do, what's this rangefinder?
[00:36:04.436 --> 00:36:13.891]   They call back the Secret Service, well they've been told no big deal, and then somehow he gets on a roof that's the police command center, and is able to shoot at the president.
[00:36:13.891 --> 00:36:16.932]   And then I've talked to acoustics experts, engineers, you name it.
[00:36:16.932 --> 00:36:19.652]  That's what they say, there's up to eight shots.
[00:36:19.652 --> 00:36:22.132]  Those aren't echoes going on.
[00:36:22.132 --> 00:36:24.771]   People that have been around a lot of gunfire, they're hearing,
[00:36:24.771 --> 00:36:28.771]   and I've had them on as guests, multiple different types of firearms.
[00:36:28.771 --> 00:36:32.131]   And one army sniper I had on the airstrike, a good friend of mine,
[00:36:32.131 --> 00:36:37.090]   he said, highly decorated guy, he said, it sounds to him like, and as people are saying,
[00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:42.211]   somebody was right under the shooter in that open window shooting because it sounded muffled, not suppressed,
[00:36:42.211 --> 00:36:44.691]   but muffled like it was being fired from inside the building.
[00:36:44.906 --> 00:36:49.128]  And again, that's all speculation, but we don't know, because there's been no press conference, no information.
[00:36:49.968 --> 00:36:54.970]  Can you speak to just speculating, dead reckoning, what you think was going on here?
[00:36:57.125 --> 00:37:04.632]  Yeah, it's, from listening to the audio and things I've heard, it seems like there was not just, you know, a handful of five, five, six rounds fired.
[00:37:06.754 --> 00:37:16.062]  It seems like, and I've seen a couple of different opinions or, I mean, reports, I guess, on what type of scope was on that assault rifle.
[00:37:16.282 --> 00:37:19.005]  I think it was just a red dot, no magnifier.
[00:37:19.025 --> 00:37:35.081]   So, to, like, If we were to go way down a rabbit hole here, it seems like having that guy set up in that position, you know, with a 5.56, you just kind of spray and pray, and it sounded like there were some other shots happening to kind of cover it up.
[00:37:36.823 --> 00:37:58.299]   And then, well, that's what the different trajectory experts, ballistic experts have shown is, if Trump's head is turned to the right, he's pointing at the sign, the Jumbotron, with the graphic on immigration and how it went to almost zero under him, And the line of sight to the shooter is here, then he's not hit in the left, he's grazed in the right.
[00:37:58.359 --> 00:38:01.241]  That would be from the woods or the water tower.
[00:38:03.923 --> 00:38:08.747]  Yeah, I've seen both theories kind of drawn out.
[00:38:09.527 --> 00:38:14.531]  To me, the water tower was again one of my initial reactions most obvious things.
[00:38:16.232 --> 00:38:18.714]  From the trees, I mean, it's possible.
[00:38:19.234 --> 00:38:25.779]  It's a tougher position to find, for sure, if you need to especially climb or have yourself elevated in the trees.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.902]  And there's movement and stuff in the trees that is tough to account for.
[00:38:31.624 --> 00:38:34.105]  But I've seen both theories drawn out.
[00:38:35.446 --> 00:38:47.973]   We're going to play in a moment, and then we're going to play the Secret Service Director's comments, because I mentioned I want to show people As one of the top snipers in the world, credited with the longest shot ever with your team, 2.2 miles.
[00:38:49.593 --> 00:38:55.054]  Watching the video, obviously shot through the ear, there's a bullet hole, looks like an electron.
[00:38:55.574 --> 00:38:58.295]  We see real people getting shot, dying, getting injured.
[00:38:59.295 --> 00:39:06.996]  And I've seen the video analysis where people are shot like a half second after the supposed first shots.
[00:39:07.056 --> 00:39:09.457]  But again, we won't know because it's all being covered up.
[00:39:11.509 --> 00:39:21.339]  Just watching that, for people that try to claim it was staged, how do you fire real bullets at somebody and then skim their ear when Trump's moving around everywhere?
[00:39:21.579 --> 00:39:22.460]  That's impossible.
[00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:32.209]  Yeah, I've heard that theory as well, and I know many of the best shooters in the whole world.
[00:39:34.227 --> 00:39:39.711]  Now, is it possible to lay down at 150 yards and hit a target as small as an ear with a precision rifle?
[00:39:39.991 --> 00:39:40.472]  For sure.
[00:39:41.693 --> 00:39:52.741]  Is it possible to do it with the confidence of someone turning their head for a split second, and if you miss by, you know, a few centimeters, then that person's dead?
[00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:54.945]  To have something staged like this?
[00:39:55.045 --> 00:39:56.626]  I think it's ridiculous.
[00:39:57.007 --> 00:39:58.367]  I don't know a shooter.
[00:39:58.367 --> 00:40:03.367]   Exactly, it's like those videos we see where the woman's spinning on the wheel and the
[00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:05.226]  guy's throwing daggers.
[00:40:05.226 --> 00:40:09.387]   They practice it all the time, it's a spinning wheel, he knows at what second to do it, still
[00:40:09.387 --> 00:40:11.686]  people get stabbed doing that.
[00:40:11.686 --> 00:40:12.807]  But this is totally different.
[00:40:13.079 --> 00:40:19.682]  This, as if Trump would sign on, I'm going to move my head around everywhere, and then you're just going to magically shoot me and graze my ear.
[00:40:19.983 --> 00:40:22.924]  Where it was off of two millimeters, it hit him in the skull.
[00:40:22.984 --> 00:40:27.227]  I mean, that, that, that, that, that is just, that's impossible, basically.
[00:40:28.367 --> 00:40:33.070]  Yeah, I literally know and have shot with many of the best shooters in the whole world.
[00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:36.832]  That is, that is not one of the scenarios here that I believe.
[00:40:37.992 --> 00:40:41.575]  Well, I got big into shooting, not into Coriolis and wind and sniper stuff, but just shooting.
[00:40:42.135 --> 00:40:48.560]  When I was a little kid, and I really stopped shooting as much as I did when I was about 16 as I got busy, but I used to shoot almost every week until then.
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.941]  I, at 100 yards, shoot the same hole all day with a rifle, 308.
[00:40:52.222 --> 00:40:55.184]  And, you know, at 200 yards, I can shoot the top of a Tabasco bottle off.
[00:40:55.545 --> 00:40:57.846]  And I never miss shooting deer, pigs, or whatever.
[00:40:57.866 --> 00:40:59.247]  I mean, I've shot stuff at 1,000 yards.
[00:41:00.268 --> 00:41:06.673]  But, to imagine a wiggling head, and I'm at 450 feet, I'm gonna shoot him in the ear?
[00:41:06.733 --> 00:41:07.734]  That's impossible.
[00:41:07.874 --> 00:41:09.155]  I mean, that is just ridiculous.
[00:41:09.976 --> 00:41:21.625]  Like I said, if you laid down in a very good, comfortable position, you had everything set up, and had a target out there, yes, you could hit that size of a target with a precision rifle and good setup and rounded stuff.
[00:41:22.165 --> 00:41:31.424]   But, like I said, with a moving head and Timing it to, oh, when I turn my head, at that exact moment, I need you to just shoot off my tip of my ear.
[00:41:31.444 --> 00:41:33.787]  It's ridiculous.
[00:41:34.347 --> 00:41:36.370]  Yeah, the idea that he would sit around and plan that.
[00:41:37.691 --> 00:41:38.953]  Yeah.
[00:41:38.973 --> 00:41:40.755]  That one I think counted immediately.
[00:41:41.935 --> 00:41:42.496]  Yeah, we're not.
[00:41:42.856 --> 00:41:43.677]  Plus, I know Trump.
[00:41:43.737 --> 00:41:44.778]  He's not that kind of guy.
[00:41:45.178 --> 00:41:45.939]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:41:45.979 --> 00:41:47.660]  So, he doesn't trust people.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.622]  He would never, he wouldn't, he's not morally going to do that anyway.
[00:41:49.662 --> 00:41:53.526]  So, I could ask a lot of questions here, brother, but you're like one of the top snipers in the world.
[00:41:53.866 --> 00:41:55.307]  What other observations do you make?
[00:41:55.327 --> 00:41:58.971]  Because people are going to be, after you leave, they're going to, you should have asked him this, you should have asked him that.
[00:42:00.772 --> 00:42:04.014]  Speaking of the event and then just in general, you're a smart guy.
[00:42:04.034 --> 00:42:05.555]  Do you think they're going to try to make another run at it?
[00:42:05.615 --> 00:42:07.216]  I mean, they're this desperate.
[00:42:07.617 --> 00:42:12.860]  You told me on the phone yesterday, you said, well, I don't want to put words around it, but I think you basically said everything points towards inside job.
[00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:15.490]  I think so.
[00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:23.573]  The initial video I ever made on this, my initial feeling was just someone that knows what's up helped that guy get there.
[00:42:24.093 --> 00:42:26.034]  And then more came out about the ballistics.
[00:42:26.114 --> 00:42:30.255]  And when I first heard the video too, the sound of the gunfire, it all sounded weird.
[00:42:31.756 --> 00:42:44.140]  So right off the bat, I just, I believe that someone who knew what was happening was involved, not just a kid with an AR walked up and got onto a roof within 150 yards of, you know, the former president.
[00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:46.791]  Future president potentially speaking.
[00:42:49.074 --> 00:42:57.724]  That was the the first thought and now as you know days pass it just everything becomes a lot more suspicious for sure.
[00:42:59.366 --> 00:43:05.407]  Well, I've talked to a lot of folks who are very well-known snipers in government.
[00:43:05.928 --> 00:43:08.768]  They can't speak, but they recommend you come on because they say you're the best.
[00:43:09.508 --> 00:43:11.669]  Just in general, what would you advise Trump?
[00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:14.190]  You've predicted prime ministers, you name it.
[00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:16.010]  What would you be advising Trump to do?
[00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:19.011]  Because Eric Trump watches, John Jr.
[00:43:19.031 --> 00:43:20.351]  watches, they get clips every day.
[00:43:21.431 --> 00:43:22.051]  We talk to them.
[00:43:22.692 --> 00:43:24.012]  What would your advice be to them right now?
[00:43:25.896 --> 00:43:30.818]  Yeah, I was chatting with a buddy of mine, Matt Murphy, who runs Sentinel Foundation.
[00:43:30.858 --> 00:43:32.118]  He was a sniper in the Green Beret.
[00:43:32.798 --> 00:43:35.099]  We had the exact same opinion right off the bat.
[00:43:35.879 --> 00:43:40.020]  We were chatting about he was down in Nashville and both said the same thing.
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:43.401]  Like he needs security that he can trust.
[00:43:44.322 --> 00:43:47.563]  I was on a live stream and said I'd come do it for free if you can't find people.
[00:43:47.903 --> 00:43:53.344]  But you need a team that you can trust because he needs to get through the however long it is.
[00:43:53.384 --> 00:43:54.785]  Now you guys have six months or something.
[00:43:56.448 --> 00:44:03.872]  And be able to take power and really do a deep dive investigation into every one and every unit and every organization that was involved.
[00:44:04.492 --> 00:44:07.514]  So this shows desperation in my opinion.
[00:44:09.035 --> 00:44:14.938]  And now you kind of have an animal cornered and generally they don't lie down.
[00:44:14.958 --> 00:44:21.361]  So I think it's really important that he just gets optimal protection and security that he can trust.
[00:44:22.379 --> 00:44:25.142]  Uh, for the next, you know, six to eight months or whatever it is.
[00:44:25.242 --> 00:44:28.184]  Well, that's exactly what, uh, Robert O'Neill said.
[00:44:28.224 --> 00:44:28.985]  He's coming up later.
[00:44:29.045 --> 00:44:30.746]  He said, this is a cornered deep state.
[00:44:31.347 --> 00:44:32.788]  They're super dangerous right now.
[00:44:32.848 --> 00:44:34.510]  And Trump better take this very, very seriously.
[00:44:35.691 --> 00:44:36.992]  Yeah, I completely agree.
[00:44:38.993 --> 00:44:41.956]  Just putting on your political cap, what do you think would have happened?
[00:44:41.976 --> 00:44:48.642]  Because one thing that makes me lean towards, it was people that weren't professionals, is why were they trying to get headshots?
[00:44:49.804 --> 00:44:54.147]  I mean, because I'm not even a sniper, but I know you shoot towards the, you know, center of mass there.
[00:44:55.667 --> 00:45:02.692]  Why would you, that's, or maybe they wanted the political image of Trump's head blowing off like Kennedy, because I know the shooters.
[00:45:03.072 --> 00:45:04.453]  I interviewed them on the deathbed confession.
[00:45:05.393 --> 00:45:17.284]  And with his son E. Howard Hunt, right before he died, I guess 15 years ago, and of course he was arrested there, it was on record he was there, but he confessed to running the sniper team.
[00:45:17.584 --> 00:45:19.345]  They had some of the best snipers in the world at that time.
[00:45:19.926 --> 00:45:22.268]  They were obviously only 50 yards away behind the grassy knoll.
[00:45:22.648 --> 00:45:29.094]  They decided to shoot Kennedy right in the head and blow his head off, I guess for the political, you know, spectacularness of it.
[00:45:29.514 --> 00:45:32.197]  But in general, right, you want to shoot somebody in the chest.
[00:45:34.727 --> 00:45:40.728]  Yeah, I mean, it depends what target is most presented or if they're assuming he's wearing body armor is another factor.
[00:45:41.749 --> 00:45:43.789]  Oh, they might have thought Trump was wearing body armor.
[00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:51.351]  It would be something that would go through my brain if there was, you know, and not saying I'm planning any type of VIP.
[00:45:51.491 --> 00:45:52.611]  No, no, we know that.
[00:45:52.931 --> 00:45:54.852]  You're the counter sniper in this case, yeah.
[00:45:54.872 --> 00:45:56.152]  Exactly.
[00:45:57.433 --> 00:46:12.144]   But I think also, you know, to play into a big grand visual, And maybe even something against, you know, guns and AR-15s and how vicious they are would be fun as a narrative.
[00:46:12.985 --> 00:46:13.986]  There's a bunch of things.
[00:46:14.046 --> 00:46:15.207]  I'm just speculating.
[00:46:15.787 --> 00:46:21.111]  My mind just sort of points in that direction when something like this happens and it's so suspicious.
[00:46:21.312 --> 00:46:27.857]  And then as days and weeks pass, where organizations have an opportunity to just say like, okay, here's what happened.
[00:46:28.277 --> 00:46:31.080]  And they can be forthcoming with all the truths.
[00:46:31.852 --> 00:46:37.015]  There's silence or there's like, you know, things that don't make any sense or the explanations.
[00:46:37.515 --> 00:46:40.096]  It just gets more and more and more suspicious.
[00:46:40.897 --> 00:46:48.981]  Well, I've talked to a lot of your community and they say the same thing you're saying, but in general, what is the consensus or what percentage think inside job, gross negligence?
[00:46:49.461 --> 00:46:49.921]  What do you think?
[00:46:49.941 --> 00:46:59.446]  Oh, I think inside job, like gross negligence, in my opinion, incompetence, it does not begin to touch what happened.
[00:46:59.526 --> 00:47:02.389]   It was, There was more happening.
[00:47:02.609 --> 00:47:14.756]  Again, I don't know the person, the agency, the group, the organization, but some person or people who knew what was happening assisted in this.
[00:47:16.117 --> 00:47:16.597]  In my opinion.
[00:47:16.937 --> 00:47:22.580]  But unfortunately, Mayorkas has appointed a Trump hater to the independent quote review panel on Trump assassination.
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.661]  So the Foxes are guarding the hen house here.
[00:47:27.283 --> 00:47:35.422]   Yeah, and that's another thing like it's just Yeah, I mean, it keeps happening and this is more your politics as I'm up here in Canada and we're dealing with our own problems.
[00:47:36.042 --> 00:47:39.283]  Um, but I just, we kind of keep seeing it again and again.
[00:47:39.363 --> 00:47:43.724]  It's just people that don't want Trump to be in power.
[00:47:44.024 --> 00:47:54.887]  And it seemed like just from an outsider watching it over the last little while that at every turn, there's just all of these ridiculous things that are being done in order to keep them out of power.
[00:47:55.347 --> 00:48:00.220]   And then this was almost like, you know, Everything else sort of failed.
[00:48:00.621 --> 00:48:06.743]  His popularity continues to grow and this was a, in my opinion, an attempt to put an end to all that.
[00:48:07.663 --> 00:48:08.303]  A hundred percent.
[00:48:09.724 --> 00:48:11.384]  Shifting gears, this is so interesting.
[00:48:13.025 --> 00:48:15.186]  Talk about that 2.2 mile shot.
[00:48:15.406 --> 00:48:17.046]  We'll go ahead and roll the video while you talk about it.
[00:48:17.606 --> 00:48:19.347]  This is on record the longest shot ever.
[00:48:19.367 --> 00:48:24.649]  I mean, in hindsight, how were you guys able to make this shot?
[00:48:26.866 --> 00:48:36.595]  Yeah, so we had just a really well-trained team and I was there with four guys, four of us total, in the top floor of a building in Mosul, Iraq.
[00:48:37.596 --> 00:48:47.505]  And we were waiting for the Iraqi push to happen, which they were pushing across to get ISIS out of their kind of last stronghold, which was in downtown Mosul.
[00:48:48.396 --> 00:48:55.378]  When that push started, we started sending rounds with these .50s and they were very effective right away.
[00:48:55.638 --> 00:48:59.419]  And we were trying to get them into buildings so we could call airstrikes on the ISIS fighters.
[00:49:00.419 --> 00:49:06.381]  And the one long shot actually, we called an airstrike on this building and it was a dud.
[00:49:06.641 --> 00:49:09.222]  And the guy was coming out the second story window.
[00:49:09.242 --> 00:49:13.883]  So that video is right after the E-plate, is right after the actual longest shot.
[00:49:14.583 --> 00:49:21.192]   The longest shot video, Is on my music video, actually, called Adios Amigo, which is on YouTube.
[00:49:23.073 --> 00:49:25.594]  And it shows the actual video of the shots.
[00:49:25.634 --> 00:49:31.776]  The guy's coming out of the second story, which gave us time to know where he was going to be, because as you mentioned, it was almost a 10 second flight time.
[00:49:31.796 --> 00:49:32.677]  We're live right now.
[00:49:32.697 --> 00:49:34.517]  We're going to post this to X in about 30 minutes.
[00:49:34.617 --> 00:49:39.219]  We'll add the clip from Adios Amigo to that to get the longest shot on TV.
[00:49:39.239 --> 00:49:41.079]  Yeah, perfect.
[00:49:41.119 --> 00:49:42.360]  Yeah, so that was that was it.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:50:09.383]   And it was, you know, it was pretty Amazing, but we were kind of in a fight for that whole week, and it was more like when we took some time at the end of the day, we were like, wow, that was quite an effective day, because the fight just sort of got closer to us as the days passed, so we made a bunch of more engagements that were, you know, 2.2 miles and in, but still probably broke the previous record five times, I'm guessing, something like that.
[00:50:10.003 --> 00:50:11.104]  And you were using what rival?
[00:50:12.925 --> 00:50:14.226]  A McMillan TAC-50.
[00:50:16.536 --> 00:50:16.776]  Wow.
[00:50:17.797 --> 00:50:18.578]  That's amazing.
[00:50:19.499 --> 00:50:21.300]  And so we're live now.
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.801]  People can't see it, but we're going to add it in post.
[00:50:22.821 --> 00:50:29.807]  We'll go up on X. In closing, appreciate you coming out and speaking out about this, because what you're telling me is that everybody else is the same out of the scenes.
[00:50:30.247 --> 00:50:33.290]  Most of them have jobs, don't want to talk about it, but a lot of folks are coming forward.
[00:50:34.451 --> 00:50:39.015]  In closing, what do you like to add or what do you think Trump should do?
[00:50:41.149 --> 00:50:46.032]  Yeah, again, I just think really good security is paramount.
[00:50:46.132 --> 00:50:59.639]  People he can trust, people that want to see the vote and want to see the people in the United States choose instead of some other people choose who's going to lead their country.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:13.026]   So no matter what the financial cost, I think it's imperative that You know, he makes it to those voting days, and then hopefully can sort some of this stuff out.
[00:51:13.266 --> 00:51:14.847]  And is that the right shot we just showed?
[00:51:15.947 --> 00:51:18.488]  Yeah, that's the one.
[00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.709]  Wow.
[00:51:18.729 --> 00:51:19.129]  2.2 miles.
[00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:24.551]  How spent is a 50-cal round at that point?
[00:51:24.571 --> 00:51:25.792]  I guess it's still so heavy it doesn't matter.
[00:51:27.438 --> 00:51:28.359]  Oh yeah, it's still ripping.
[00:51:28.479 --> 00:51:29.900]  You see that video, that guy went down.
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:30.740]  He did not get up.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:38.245]  He laid there for two weeks, I know, because my brother-in-law crossed the bridge after we ripped out of country and he told me, your guy's still laying in the dirt.
[00:51:38.786 --> 00:51:40.707]  Dallas Alexander, we gotta go to break for two minutes.
[00:51:40.727 --> 00:51:41.707]  We'll do five more minutes with us.
[00:51:41.727 --> 00:51:42.608]  I've got a few other questions.
[00:51:42.648 --> 00:51:43.689]  We really appreciate your time.
[00:51:43.709 --> 00:51:46.070]  People can find you at dallasalexander.ca.
[00:51:46.711 --> 00:51:49.132]  Heard some of your music yesterday, amazing.
[00:51:49.473 --> 00:51:55.677]  People should check that out, but we appreciate you coming on as a Canadian Special Operations veteran to give us your perspective.
[00:51:56.673 --> 00:51:59.754]  You were highly recommended by the folks at the Trump operation.
[00:52:00.114 --> 00:52:01.194]  We'll be right back in two minutes.
[00:52:01.214 --> 00:52:01.575]  Stay with us.
[00:52:03.135 --> 00:52:08.297]  This is a make it or break it moment, so I need people to connect those synapses in their brain for you to make a decision.
[00:52:09.457 --> 00:52:12.558]  If you don't support InfoWars, we will be shut down.
[00:52:13.778 --> 00:52:15.399]  People say, well, they're constantly trying to shut you down.
[00:52:15.439 --> 00:52:16.179]  How are you still on the air?
[00:52:16.339 --> 00:52:16.619]  God.
[00:52:17.659 --> 00:52:18.720]  But God works through people.
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:25.522]  So we're in a paradox here where the judge says we're open for three more months.
[00:52:27.253 --> 00:52:31.696]  If we're able to get a buyer under the law, they won't be able to shut us down.
[00:52:31.736 --> 00:52:32.636]  I'll just work with somebody else.
[00:52:33.557 --> 00:52:34.057]  And that's coming.
[00:52:34.077 --> 00:52:34.778]  That's got to be set up.
[00:52:35.958 --> 00:52:45.144]  But in the meantime, if people believe the news that we're being shut down everywhere, which they tried to do and failed, by that foregone conclusion, we're shut down.
[00:52:45.284 --> 00:52:56.607]   And under the last federal bankruptcy manager who would not reorder product and killed all our advertising, who was positioning us to be shut down and tried to shut us down, We caught him.
[00:52:56.847 --> 00:52:57.888]  The judge caught him and fired him.
[00:52:59.389 --> 00:53:00.870]  We're almost sold out of all the products.
[00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:01.930]  All right?
[00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:05.492]  But we have a lot of great products that are still in stock.
[00:53:05.972 --> 00:53:06.713]  Limited supplies.
[00:53:06.773 --> 00:53:10.034]  So I need you to go to InfoWarsaw.com.
[00:53:10.254 --> 00:53:11.295]  And we just had a donation button.
[00:53:11.315 --> 00:53:12.095]  Maybe we should just do that.
[00:53:12.836 --> 00:53:15.597]  You're fighting for freedom in a key election, battling the globalists.
[00:53:15.617 --> 00:53:16.258]  We need support.
[00:53:16.998 --> 00:53:18.539]  But we want a long-term relationship with you.
[00:53:19.619 --> 00:53:20.520]  We want you to be symbiotic.
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:28.047]  We want you to get great products you like and deliver to you quickly and enjoy them and have them empower you and make your life better so you love them and you keep getting them.
[00:53:28.067 --> 00:53:29.008]  We want a relationship.
[00:53:29.958 --> 00:53:35.721]  So, there's the InfoWars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[00:53:36.461 --> 00:53:43.705]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's salt palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[00:53:43.725 --> 00:53:48.167]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[00:53:48.227 --> 00:53:49.488]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[00:53:50.188 --> 00:54:00.896]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWars MD.
[00:54:01.257 --> 00:54:02.818]  We've got Ashwagandha Gummi.

[00:54:15.167 --> 00:54:15.688]  People love it.
[00:54:15.848 --> 00:54:16.629]  Goodnight Sleep.

[00:54:30.583 --> 00:54:31.424]  Huge bottle of it.
[00:54:31.524 --> 00:54:32.365]  You know, jam-packed.
[00:54:32.825 --> 00:54:33.386]  It's there.

[00:54:36.629 --> 00:54:37.409]  Prostate support.
[00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:38.150]  I already mentioned that.
[00:54:38.771 --> 00:54:40.072]  This is just the top formula.
[00:54:40.092 --> 00:54:40.893]  Super high quality.
[00:54:41.273 --> 00:54:41.673]  Organic.
[00:54:42.254 --> 00:54:43.135]  Nerve Renew.

[00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:01.700]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:05.940]   I really see something that said, take a look at what happened.
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:14.940]  Get down, get down, get down, get down.
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:22.940]  Get him, get him.
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:31.940]  Move it to the spare, hold, hold.

[00:55:35.884 --> 00:55:39.884]  USA! USA! USA!
[00:55:39.884 --> 00:55:42.884]   Turns out for 20 plus minutes people ran around pointing at the shooter.
[00:55:42.884 --> 00:55:44.884]  Total stand down.
[00:55:44.884 --> 00:55:46.884]   We don't think they got caught up in even their fake investigation.
[00:55:47.204 --> 00:55:48.105]  They're trying to shut down that.
[00:55:48.565 --> 00:55:49.265]  We know they did it.
[00:55:49.345 --> 00:55:50.606]  We know Trump's in grave danger.
[00:55:51.947 --> 00:55:56.289]  Credited with leading the sniper team and has the longest shot in history, Dallas Alexander.
[00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:57.890]  DallasAlexander.ca.
[00:55:57.930 --> 00:55:58.790]  Amazing information.
[00:55:59.231 --> 00:56:01.152]  Join us in this little short segment.
[00:56:02.051 --> 00:56:04.713]  I just wanted to ask him, in closing, about other threats.
[00:56:04.753 --> 00:56:07.615]  Drones, truck bombs, poisoning.
[00:56:07.775 --> 00:56:13.979]  I mean, if they tried to kill Trump because he's so popular and they're cornered rats, it's obviously inside job, folks.
[00:56:14.039 --> 00:56:14.620]  Don't be idiots.
[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:19.163]  Then, 99% chance, then they're going to be even more desperate now.
[00:56:19.463 --> 00:56:20.243]  What's your view on that?
[00:56:23.185 --> 00:56:26.287]  Yeah, I think, like we were talking about the desperation now.
[00:56:27.802 --> 00:56:59.766]   Is hopefully what you can hire the right people to protect against and like you mentioned with all of those things there there's you know, there's a million ways to kill someone sadly and This just the size of some of the the VB IEDs we've seen overseas can rock an entire block So there's I think they got to take into account everything and drones like correct me if I'm wrong There was a drone flying around over that rally That same day, right Yes sir, hours before.
[00:57:01.147 --> 00:57:10.980]  Yeah, so again that like, I mean we had it overseas that ISIS was using drones to drop bombs and they've rigged up this stuff just, you know.
[00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:17.409]   themselves. So there's possibilities from everywhere. I think they just again need the
[00:57:17.409 --> 00:57:22.369]   best that they can find in the world to protect kind of 360 for the next six to eight months.
[00:57:22.369 --> 00:57:29.008]   That's right. It could come from anywhere. 105 days and then there's 79 days till he's sworn in.
[00:57:29.008 --> 00:57:33.648]   He's president elect. That's the real danger zone. So you concur with all the other great
[00:57:33.648 --> 00:57:37.889]   analysts I've talked to off air and on air. Everything points towards inside job. And so
[00:57:38.528 --> 00:57:41.709]  they're even more desperate now. So the ante is even upped.
[00:57:41.709 --> 00:57:45.089]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:57:45.271 --> 00:57:50.455]  I think just now a very deliberate security kind of bubble, if you will.
[00:57:51.456 --> 00:57:58.521]  But it has to be 360, it has to be drones, it has to be on road moves, it has to be when he's stationary and he's speaking engagements.
[00:57:59.601 --> 00:58:10.836]   And even, you know, sadly things like wherever he's eating or drinking or whatever, it's kind of Ultimate paranoia time for the next, you know, eight months or whatever.
[00:58:10.896 --> 00:58:17.078]  Absolutely, and going back to the footage we just showed, there he is an hour before the attack, and that's when they went over and talked to him.
[00:58:17.098 --> 00:58:18.339]  Local police had a rangefinder.
[00:58:18.379 --> 00:58:24.661]  What would you do if a guy 450 feet from the president is a guy wandering around looking at a roof with a rangefinder?
[00:58:24.941 --> 00:58:27.302]  I mean that guy's in protective custody immediately.
[00:58:27.322 --> 00:58:32.844]  Like, at a minimum, just apprehended for the remainder of the rally.
[00:58:32.864 --> 00:58:34.085]  You know what I mean?
[00:58:34.125 --> 00:58:35.803]   Like, At a minimum.
[00:58:35.843 --> 00:58:44.905]  Because sure, a rangefinder's not restricted, but it definitely tells you that he's thinking about something that he needs range for, and he didn't look like he was golfing.
[00:58:44.965 --> 00:58:51.846]  So, like, to me, at a minimum, you just apprehend him until the rally's over.
[00:58:52.206 --> 00:58:57.727]  Like, you know, and the posture's suspicious, the left and right, it's sketchy.
[00:58:58.187 --> 00:59:01.108]  Just at a minimum, okay, come with us, sir, until this is done.
[00:59:03.410 --> 00:59:06.893]  Dallas Alexander, the prime suspect is Alexander Mayorkas.
[00:59:06.933 --> 00:59:07.593]  He opened the border.
[00:59:07.653 --> 00:59:08.334]  He's running it all.
[00:59:08.714 --> 00:59:10.456]  He refused security for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:59:10.916 --> 00:59:15.640]  This guy, this guy is a bad hombre.
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:17.221]  Thank you so much for the time.
[00:59:18.242 --> 00:59:21.244]  I know that you're really getting successful in your music career.
[00:59:21.264 --> 00:59:22.205]  We want to promote that.
[00:59:22.745 --> 00:59:26.749]  And you've got a new line of songs coming out under Don't Blame My Bloodline.
[00:59:26.769 --> 00:59:27.149]  Is that right?
[00:59:28.348 --> 00:59:29.409]  Can't Blame My Bloodline.
[00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:31.030]  Can't Blame My Bloodline.
[00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:34.371]  And what's the song they should search or find on your website?
[00:59:34.692 --> 00:59:35.912]  DallasAlexander.ca.
[00:59:37.974 --> 00:59:38.834]  Go listen to any of them.
[00:59:38.874 --> 00:59:44.737]  Can't Blame My Bloodline, the title track is out right now and there's a bunch more, another one coming out this month.
[00:59:45.198 --> 00:59:46.698]  We're gonna grab it, we're gonna air it later.
[00:59:46.719 --> 00:59:49.700]  You want me to post it on X?
[00:59:50.241 --> 00:59:50.641]  Can I do that?
[00:59:51.894 --> 00:59:52.314]  Sure, absolutely.
[00:59:52.334 --> 00:59:54.196]  All right, we're gonna make a music video, brother.
[00:59:54.216 --> 00:59:54.996]  I'm gonna put it out.
[00:59:55.497 --> 00:59:57.438]  God bless you, Dallas Alexander.
[00:59:57.498 --> 00:59:58.379]  Thank you so much, brother.
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:00.140]  Thanks for having me.
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:00.721]  Appreciate it.
[01:00:00.781 --> 01:00:01.101]  Thank you.
[01:00:01.582 --> 01:00:03.963]  All right, we are now into hour number two.
[01:00:04.043 --> 01:00:13.591]  Coming up in the last 30 minutes of the next hour, Robert J. O'Neill, the most famous Navy SEAL and expert on what's happening.
[01:00:13.631 --> 01:00:21.852]   He basically incurs, I talked to him off-air, with what Dallas Alexander, the credited top sniper, 2.2 mile kill.
[01:00:22.413 --> 01:00:25.714]  He was saying they had a bunch of kills that day at that, but that was only documented on video.
[01:00:26.594 --> 01:00:28.094]  He just said, total inside job.
[01:00:28.114 --> 01:00:29.175]  They're going to try to kill Trump.
[01:00:29.315 --> 01:00:30.395]  It's on like Donkey Kong.
[01:00:31.676 --> 01:00:32.776]  So here's what's going to happen.
[01:00:33.976 --> 01:00:42.559]  I've got all this other news, all the big political developments, Biden stepping down, missing, even Fox News saying, is he dead?
[01:00:42.599 --> 01:00:43.960]  I think that's a fair thing to ask.
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:44.740]  I'm not saying he is.
[01:00:46.823 --> 01:00:54.064]  Who are they going to try to replace Kamala with or will she put a VP on like Gavin Newsom or Hillary Clinton or Whitmer?
[01:00:55.064 --> 01:00:55.985]  The sky's the limit.
[01:00:56.025 --> 01:01:00.565]  Now they're saying, oh, this will give Trump a run for his money.
[01:01:01.285 --> 01:01:03.386]  Because no one believes Biden would win.
[01:01:03.946 --> 01:01:06.806]  They want someone plausible when they steal it.
[01:01:07.607 --> 01:01:12.547]  Mike Cernovich did a great interview that's on Infowars.com with the great Tucker Carlson basically laying that out.
[01:01:13.348 --> 01:01:15.248]  Maybe we should get Mike on the show or try to get him on.
[01:01:15.288 --> 01:01:15.888]  He's hard to get on.
[01:01:16.816 --> 01:01:19.078]  But, that's where we are.
[01:01:19.118 --> 01:01:20.719]  Such a historic moment.
[01:01:21.439 --> 01:01:25.202]  And the Globalists are in their own publications like New York Times, Atlantic Monthly, Financial Times.
[01:01:25.822 --> 01:01:32.907]  Shane, we hope that conservatives think they won and just go to sleep and we're going to win.
[01:01:34.248 --> 01:01:35.189]  Which means they're going to steal it.
[01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:42.474]  But I've done all the statistics, I've gone over it a thousand times, but it's very hard to steal when you have a landslide.
[01:01:44.324 --> 01:01:46.506]  So that's why Trump is still working so hard.
[01:01:46.606 --> 01:01:56.012]  What a nail biter, what a cliffhanger, what a moment to be alive right now and to be witnessing all of this.
[01:01:56.052 --> 01:02:04.918]  So I want to open the phones up for one slice of society.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:12.519]   So I'm asking listeners, please don't call in if you're not law enforcement,
[01:02:12.519 --> 01:02:23.720]  Secret Service, Federal Marshal, snipers particularly.
[01:02:23.895 --> 01:02:27.518]  We want to leave the lines open for these men and women.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:32.222]  Not putting the women down, we saw the women they had there, they couldn't even holster a gun.
[01:02:32.763 --> 01:02:37.067]  There are women that can shoot guns great, women are incredible snipers, but that's not the type of women they can get.
[01:02:37.207 --> 01:02:38.648]  They put an ad out, hey we want women!
[01:02:38.668 --> 01:02:47.513]   Diversity, equity, inclusion, and then women don't Answer the call?
[01:02:48.134 --> 01:02:49.995]  Like this office is almost completely men.
[01:02:50.375 --> 01:02:51.235]  Got a few women workers.
[01:02:52.136 --> 01:02:52.756]  Well, you know why?
[01:02:53.416 --> 01:02:56.218]  Women don't answer the call to work in radio, television, film.
[01:02:56.338 --> 01:02:57.058]  I don't know why.
[01:02:57.539 --> 01:02:58.039]  They don't come.
[01:02:58.179 --> 01:02:59.380]  Maybe they see it's Alex Jones.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.640]  They don't come to the interviews.
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:01.160]  They don't come.
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:01.661]  They're not there.
[01:03:03.642 --> 01:03:05.783]  So, you can be black, brown, white.
[01:03:06.143 --> 01:03:06.823]  You can be Asian.
[01:03:06.863 --> 01:03:07.724]  You can be whatever.
[01:03:08.244 --> 01:03:09.084]  You've got a skill.
[01:03:09.685 --> 01:03:09.985]  Whatever.
[01:03:10.065 --> 01:03:10.745]  You want to work here?
[01:03:10.825 --> 01:03:11.686]  We hired folks.
[01:03:13.187 --> 01:03:13.767]  Barely any women.
[01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:23.885]  Well imagine the Secret Service, they put a call out for women and then they get like a fat woman who can barely, in fact she can't holster a gun.
[01:03:25.806 --> 01:03:40.638]  It'd be like putting a fat woman or me up there to play NBA basketball against LeBron James and Scotty Pippen and Larry Bird and Michael Jordan.
[01:03:41.974 --> 01:03:43.035]  I mean, it's just, it's ridiculous.
[01:03:43.975 --> 01:03:53.401]  It's a default that all the Secret Service agents that are the close to tail, the central ring, have got to be the height or higher than the targets.
[01:03:53.421 --> 01:03:54.902]  They're supposed to shield the President.
[01:03:55.443 --> 01:04:02.427]  Well, how is a five foot tall woman, there, pulls her gun out, can't even put it back in, how is she supposed to stand above him and protect him?
[01:04:04.168 --> 01:04:06.090]  See, that's what this is all about.
[01:04:06.877 --> 01:04:09.398]  And they're saying, hey, we don't care if you can't fly an airplane.
[01:04:09.418 --> 01:04:10.819]  We don't care if you fail the test.
[01:04:10.839 --> 01:04:12.139]  We're going to put you in there as a pilot.
[01:04:13.279 --> 01:04:21.483]  Because really, most of the planes are flown by AI wireless now.
[01:04:23.924 --> 01:04:24.384]  Autopilot.
[01:04:25.764 --> 01:04:33.047]  See, the globalists, the Pentagon just came out Friday and said, by 2030, 30 plus percent of the military will be robot.
[01:04:33.587 --> 01:04:35.488]  They're sabotaging the human military.
[01:04:37.031 --> 01:04:39.193]  To bring in the robot military that will follow the orcs.
[01:04:40.314 --> 01:04:49.483]  So I'm calling for Secret Service, FBI, snipers, military veterans, your chance to get on air.
[01:04:49.523 --> 01:04:50.584]  We want to talk to you.
[01:04:50.604 --> 01:04:55.889]  And we'll go to you quickly so you hopefully aren't on hold very long.
[01:04:57.251 --> 01:05:05.959]  The toll-free number is 877-789-2539.
[01:05:05.979 --> 01:05:06.299]  877-789-2539.
[01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:06.860]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:05:08.281 --> 01:05:20.131]  And we are going to take your calls and cover news right up until the last 30 minutes of the next hour, so about an hour and 20 minutes from now, when Robert J. O'Neill comes on.
[01:05:23.594 --> 01:05:24.615]  And I talked to him yesterday.
[01:05:25.905 --> 01:05:27.346]  He's the guy who reportedly killed Bin Laden.
[01:05:27.827 --> 01:05:29.908]  I said, you know I question Bin Laden being killed.
[01:05:30.409 --> 01:05:31.149]  He said, I know you did that.
[01:05:31.169 --> 01:05:31.509]  It's fine.
[01:05:31.529 --> 01:05:32.030]  You're allowed to.
[01:05:33.151 --> 01:05:34.091]  He said, I know I was there.
[01:05:34.932 --> 01:05:36.233]  It was his wife.
[01:05:37.074 --> 01:05:37.734]  He got out of the bed.
[01:05:37.774 --> 01:05:38.234]  I shot him.
[01:05:39.555 --> 01:05:40.016]  It was real.
[01:05:40.716 --> 01:05:41.557]  That's confidence.
[01:05:41.657 --> 01:05:43.498]  He definitely said it was a body double.
[01:05:44.659 --> 01:05:46.781]  He was in bed with Bin Laden's wife, so he deserved to die.
[01:05:46.961 --> 01:05:47.542]  That was his quote.
[01:05:48.282 --> 01:05:51.104]  He's going to come back on and talk about that, but I talked to people that were there with him.
[01:05:51.464 --> 01:05:54.427]  Then they blew up a helicopter with a bunch of Navy SEALs that were there trying to cover it up.
[01:05:55.109 --> 01:06:01.314]  Month later, and I don't know, but I know he has the courage to come on and talk about this stuff.
[01:06:01.894 --> 01:06:02.595]  So there you go.
[01:06:03.115 --> 01:06:10.400]  So we'll do a whole discussion about that coming up with him, because I'm not impugning him.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.141]  I'm not saying he's a liar.
[01:06:11.161 --> 01:06:12.162]  I think there's a lot of credibility.
[01:06:13.843 --> 01:06:18.426]  It's just people hated Obama so much they didn't want to give him any type of points, I guess.
[01:06:18.787 --> 01:06:28.165]   In hindsight, I thought they probably didn't care about a lot, and I still don't know, but I think that Robert J. O'Neill is a credible Guy with how many silver stars and bronze stars and all the things he did.
[01:06:30.646 --> 01:06:36.607]  So we'll be doing that interview coming up at 1.33 central.
[01:06:37.108 --> 01:06:39.628]  He will be joining us to give his take on all this.
[01:06:39.668 --> 01:06:40.609]  I really look forward to that.
[01:06:42.189 --> 01:06:43.709]  Okay, so let's pull back here.
[01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:47.991]  Because there's a lot of stuff to unpack here.
[01:06:48.031 --> 01:06:49.691]  A lot of big enchiladas.
[01:06:51.052 --> 01:06:54.725]   So while we're Punch up the phone system and get that up so I can see it.
[01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:59.909]  I'm going to go ahead and cover the election news, Biden dropping out, all of it.
[01:06:59.989 --> 01:07:01.069]  And should we do it?
[01:07:01.170 --> 01:07:01.810]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:05.493]  Because we put a short clip up yesterday, it got like 10 million views.
[01:07:05.533 --> 01:07:06.794]  People said, oh, that's not a real clip.
[01:07:07.174 --> 01:07:17.202]  So Chase Gosar put another clip, got like 2 million views last time I saw it, of like 10 minutes of me saying, in the last two weeks, he'll step down by the 20th or 21st in my trajectory view.
[01:07:17.935 --> 01:07:20.597]  And a lot goes into the calculations of that, because I'm not a sniper.
[01:07:20.617 --> 01:07:22.118]  When it comes to politics, I am.
[01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:23.940]  I've got all the factors together.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:30.685]  I can see the writing on the wall, Biden jockeying to get a bunch of favors and deals.
[01:07:30.765 --> 01:07:35.488]  But now the weird wrinkle, I said, if he doesn't step down, they'll kill him and poison him.
[01:07:38.791 --> 01:07:40.212]  And now they're reporting he's missing.
[01:07:41.353 --> 01:07:42.934]  Now they're reporting they don't know where he is.
[01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:47.730]  He's been gone four and a half days, and I'm not saying he's dead.
[01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:50.251]  That's Fox News alluding to that.
[01:07:52.031 --> 01:07:53.152]  So we'll play this clip in a moment.
[01:07:54.492 --> 01:07:55.592]  Proof of life, please.
[01:07:55.712 --> 01:07:58.433]  Fox hosts ask if Biden is even still alive.
[01:07:59.674 --> 01:08:01.934]  We'll go over some of these articles for you right now.
[01:08:04.815 --> 01:08:05.516]  A red shot, please.
[01:08:07.036 --> 01:08:09.637]  So, there's that headline, InfoWars.com.
[01:08:10.677 --> 01:08:12.158]  Now listen to this cryptic headline.
[01:08:13.883 --> 01:08:21.346]  Biden's brother says they will enjoy whatever time they have left with him, implying he's dying.
[01:08:23.607 --> 01:08:24.148]  Who wrote it?
[01:08:24.208 --> 01:08:31.191]  Internet buzzes as Biden's signature on dropout letter doesn't match signatures on executive orders.
[01:08:31.931 --> 01:08:38.154]  You can see it's real signature versus the new one.
[01:08:38.174 --> 01:08:40.655]  It looks nothing like the same one.
[01:08:40.975 --> 01:08:45.340]   And I thought that when it came out Saturday, I said, This is strange.
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.341]  There's no presidential seal on this.
[01:08:48.741 --> 01:08:50.421]  And I went and looked up his signature myself.
[01:08:50.621 --> 01:08:51.201]  It didn't match.
[01:08:53.061 --> 01:08:53.682]  Not even close.
[01:08:55.582 --> 01:08:56.522]  Is Joe Biden alive?
[01:08:56.562 --> 01:08:58.242]  Fox News host asks for proof of life.
[01:08:58.662 --> 01:09:00.663]  Biden hasn't been seen publicly for four plus days.
[01:09:01.883 --> 01:09:03.543]  None of us understands what's happening.
[01:09:03.603 --> 01:09:12.505]  Biden campaign staffers, blindside of a 2024 announcement, learning about it on X. Now we learn from a year plus, his staff isn't allowed to meet with him.
[01:09:12.625 --> 01:09:13.805]  He's kept away from people.
[01:09:16.491 --> 01:09:21.114]  So here's the actual letter with a signature that looks as fake as a $3 bill.
[01:09:24.035 --> 01:09:24.595]  Zoom in on that.
[01:09:25.896 --> 01:09:28.478]  You match that with other signatures, looks nothing like it.
[01:09:29.358 --> 01:09:33.160]  And where's Joseph R. Biden Jr.?
[01:09:34.661 --> 01:09:36.242]  There's no presidential seal.
[01:09:37.362 --> 01:09:38.923]  There's no anything.
[01:09:40.044 --> 01:09:40.984]  Did they kill Biden?
[01:09:42.285 --> 01:09:43.426]  I'm not saying that happened.
[01:09:44.773 --> 01:09:47.855]  But that's a very serious question in this climate you've got to ask.
[01:09:49.076 --> 01:09:50.357]  Where is Biden?
[01:09:51.258 --> 01:09:55.961]  We've been at Weekend with Bernie all the last few months.
[01:09:57.042 --> 01:09:58.563]  He's been hiding, and now he's gone.
[01:09:58.803 --> 01:10:00.264]  They may toddle him out.
[01:10:01.405 --> 01:10:02.426]  He may be seen soon.
[01:10:02.706 --> 01:10:04.708]  I don't know, but this is really weird.
[01:10:05.208 --> 01:10:06.309]  A blank sheet of paper?
[01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:08.050]  No seals on it?
[01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:08.771]  No information?
[01:10:10.772 --> 01:10:11.833]  His resignation letter?
[01:10:13.522 --> 01:10:14.883]  And no one knows where he is?
[01:10:15.804 --> 01:10:17.105]  We're in a live coup, folks.
[01:10:17.265 --> 01:10:21.949]  Any way you slice it, they didn't have the primaries that they stole from Bernie Sanders.
[01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:26.793]  They wouldn't let anybody challenge him.
[01:10:27.374 --> 01:10:28.695]  They tried to take Trump off the ballot.
[01:10:28.715 --> 01:10:29.695]  They did all the lawfare.
[01:10:30.096 --> 01:10:31.657]  They've been doing this for a long time.
[01:10:32.037 --> 01:10:36.181]  And now, I said if Biden doesn't step down, I said it a week ago, they'll just kill him.
[01:10:36.421 --> 01:10:37.342]  They'll just claim he had a stroke.
[01:10:39.597 --> 01:10:40.517]  Is he dead right now?
[01:10:40.557 --> 01:10:42.278]  They're just jockeying to say who gets what?
[01:10:42.658 --> 01:10:45.259]  I don't think so, but he's mentally brain dead.
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:47.660]  We know that.
[01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:49.841]  What a constitutional crisis.
[01:10:49.761 --> 01:10:51.761]  What insanity we're now in.
[01:10:51.761 --> 01:11:01.761]  Hadn't been seen in four plus days.
[01:11:02.645 --> 01:11:05.346]  But it's not Alex Jones questioning it, and you're allowed to question.
[01:11:06.026 --> 01:11:12.978]   You know, Joy Reid says it was fake, and All these other Democrats have come out and said it was a fake shooting and all the rest of this.
[01:11:13.018 --> 01:11:13.798]  That's idiotic.
[01:11:13.898 --> 01:11:15.918]  We have a chance to respond and say it's bull.
[01:11:16.918 --> 01:11:18.979]  Anybody that knows guns or ballistics knows it's crap.
[01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:28.280]  But if Keith Olbermann and Joy Reid and Joy Behar and the rest of them want to say it's fake, they have a right to say the moon is made out of pimento cheese.
[01:11:31.401 --> 01:11:33.901]  They have a right to say the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus are real.
[01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:37.022]  They have the First Amendment.
[01:11:37.062 --> 01:11:38.082]  That's what this country's all about.
[01:11:42.796 --> 01:11:45.437]  But the point is, he's missing for four and a half days.
[01:11:46.857 --> 01:11:48.137]  It's not an official letterhead.
[01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:52.778]  His brother says, enjoy the time he's got left.
[01:11:55.599 --> 01:11:56.399]  What's the exact quote?
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.700]  Enjoying whatever time he has left.
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:01.121]  Signature doesn't match.
[01:12:01.981 --> 01:12:03.441]  This is creepy as hell.
[01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:05.822]  So I mentioned the clip.
[01:12:06.282 --> 01:12:07.942]  We don't just mention stuff like the media does.
[01:12:07.962 --> 01:12:10.323]  They'll say, Trump hates all Mexicans.
[01:12:10.363 --> 01:12:10.883]  Where's the clip?
[01:12:12.321 --> 01:12:14.384]  Jones peed on Sandy Hook kid's graves.
[01:12:14.484 --> 01:12:15.085]  Where's the clip?
[01:12:16.406 --> 01:12:16.907]  Didn't happen.
[01:12:17.508 --> 01:12:19.790]  Wasn't even ever there until they sued me and I went there for the court.
[01:12:20.712 --> 01:12:25.057]  But they just sit there and they make these claims without any evidence.
[01:12:25.097 --> 01:12:26.879]  Well, when we make a claim, we cover it.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:31.145]  So here's Fox News asking proof of life on Joe Biden.
[01:12:32.962 --> 01:12:38.385]  I want to go back to your previous statement, Dana, about not seeing President Biden today.
[01:12:38.545 --> 01:12:57.435]  I think, as you think about what has transpired today since 1.45 p.m., not physically seeing him, even address a camera in Delaware, let alone an Oval Office statement like LBJ did when he dropped out in March of 1968, it is disconcerting, isn't it?
[01:12:58.136 --> 01:13:00.997]  Brett, they didn't even release a White House still photograph.
[01:13:01.738 --> 01:13:02.018]  Nothing.
[01:13:02.970 --> 01:13:05.532]  So are we, I mean, I hope he's fine.
[01:13:06.032 --> 01:13:09.955]  But you could forgive people for wondering if we are really living Weekend at Bernie's right now.
[01:13:10.495 --> 01:13:11.696]  Like, proof of life, please.
[01:13:11.736 --> 01:13:13.157]  Let's see, let's see it, okay?
[01:13:13.217 --> 01:13:14.618]  We want the president to be okay.
[01:13:14.938 --> 01:13:19.341]  I do want him to be able to leave on a note that is high in his mind, right?
[01:13:19.381 --> 01:13:27.026]  So that he feels like he had this public service career where he achieved the ultimate and he's obviously unwell.
[01:13:27.767 --> 01:13:48.426]   And so, you know, we want him to be a person that can like, Stand on his own two feet and look the American people in the eye and explain why he's leaving because without that, imagine what your, again, your allies, your adversaries, your enemies, your military, your voters are all sitting there going, well wait, so why are you withdrawing?
[01:13:48.967 --> 01:13:49.788]  Is it because of health?
[01:13:49.868 --> 01:13:51.910]  And if so, please let us know so we can pray for you.
[01:13:52.431 --> 01:13:54.212]  Is it because you were afraid you were going to lose?
[01:13:54.933 --> 01:13:58.456]  That's what Jared Moskowitz just said, the congressman from Florida, so that's interesting.
[01:13:58.717 --> 01:14:11.969]  I would note that while we've been on the air, the Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, has endorsed Kamala Harris, and she is one of the few people that has floated as a possible vice presidential nominee for him.
[01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:29.579]   On this idea that old is off the table, I just don't think that anybody who watched the last week at the RNC can make an honest comparison about Joe Biden's cognitive decline that we've been watching and the 78-year-old Donald Trump.
[01:14:29.899 --> 01:14:31.801]  That just doesn't, I don't think that's going to work.
[01:14:33.864 --> 01:14:34.184]  Alright.
[01:14:35.505 --> 01:14:36.947]  I'm going to say it again, I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:14:36.967 --> 01:14:38.028]  I appreciate you calling.
[01:14:39.966 --> 01:14:41.167]  It's not an official letterhead.
[01:14:41.447 --> 01:14:43.608]  The signature is obviously a different person.
[01:14:43.828 --> 01:14:44.649]  I mean, I just showed it.
[01:14:44.869 --> 01:14:47.210]  There's no doubt in my mind.
[01:14:48.511 --> 01:14:49.412]  It's completely different.
[01:14:50.192 --> 01:14:50.772]  Totally fake.
[01:14:51.713 --> 01:14:52.934]  The bank would refuse to own a check.
[01:14:55.755 --> 01:14:58.457]  He hasn't been seen in four and a half days, and they're asking is he dead.
[01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:01.118]  And he was refusing to step down.
[01:15:01.138 --> 01:15:04.520]  Now his brother says he's on death's doorstep, basically.
[01:15:05.741 --> 01:15:06.902]  Now he may pop back up.
[01:15:09.031 --> 01:15:09.571]  Is he dead?
[01:15:09.591 --> 01:15:10.892]  Do you have another medical emergency?
[01:15:10.912 --> 01:15:16.754]  I mean, last time I was seen four and a half days ago, walking off Air Force One, he could barely walk.
[01:15:17.975 --> 01:15:19.375]  And again, they have doctors that control him.
[01:15:19.635 --> 01:15:20.736]  Maybe they took the drugs away.
[01:15:23.357 --> 01:15:33.901]  I've talked to Secret Service, who are good people, and high level, believe it or not, other law enforcement that were there and saw the Pelican case, all the drugs, and them giving him drugs.
[01:15:35.191 --> 01:15:38.153]  And him popping back up, having him put down, him pooping himself.
[01:15:38.574 --> 01:15:39.495]  This isn't funny, folks.
[01:15:39.515 --> 01:15:40.335]  This is disgusting.
[01:15:41.776 --> 01:15:42.637]  This is what they've done.
[01:15:42.817 --> 01:15:44.318]  And now they want Kamala, a new puppet.
[01:15:44.859 --> 01:15:47.541]  We'll talk about who they're going to put in.
[01:15:47.561 --> 01:15:51.124]  They're saying Kamala, but there's a lot of signs there.
[01:15:52.525 --> 01:15:53.206]  That's not the case.
[01:15:53.906 --> 01:15:56.088]  You heard Obama and others say, oh, we're keeping Biden forever.
[01:15:56.148 --> 01:15:57.689]  I said, all their surrogates attacked him.
[01:15:57.749 --> 01:15:58.770]  I said, no, they're really against him.
[01:15:59.110 --> 01:16:00.732]  And now that's come out.
[01:16:02.344 --> 01:16:03.625]  So, here's who we've got on the board.
[01:16:03.785 --> 01:16:08.407]  And we've got some open lines, because people are being nice who aren't law enforcement or experts, and they're not calling in.
[01:16:08.447 --> 01:16:08.828]  That's great.
[01:16:09.688 --> 01:16:12.470]  We've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven callers that called in.
[01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:15.451]  Got a few extra lines for law enforcement, snipers, to give your take.
[01:16:15.912 --> 01:16:16.032]  At 877-789-2539.
[01:16:16.052 --> 01:16:16.152]  877-789-2539.
[01:16:16.172 --> 01:16:16.452]  877-789-Alex.
[01:16:16.492 --> 01:16:19.053]  We're not going to you, we're going to you in a minute.
[01:16:18.873 --> 01:16:25.193]  877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex.
[01:16:25.193 --> 01:16:28.113]   We have, we're not going to, we're going to in a minute, I just want to, well, listen to this here,
[01:16:28.113 --> 01:16:30.312]  so I'm going to you.
[01:16:30.312 --> 01:16:33.433]  Michael and Boston military Marine sniper.
[01:16:33.421 --> 01:16:37.244]  Holly in Pennsylvania, civilian, was at the rally, witnessed Butler P.A.
[01:16:37.284 --> 01:16:37.524]  shooting.
[01:16:37.544 --> 01:16:38.305]  We'll go to her first.
[01:16:38.885 --> 01:16:41.167]  Woody in Washington, law enforcement on the Trump shooting.
[01:16:41.267 --> 01:16:43.008]  David, forgetting his information.
[01:16:43.488 --> 01:16:45.750]  Joe in Baltimore, military, marine, Afghanistan.
[01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:48.672]  And David, military, Army on Trump shooting.
[01:16:49.232 --> 01:16:51.634]  Let's go to Holly, and then we'll go to Michael.
[01:16:51.954 --> 01:16:53.975]  Holly in P.A., where it all happened.
[01:16:54.035 --> 01:16:55.116]  Thank you for calling in.
[01:16:55.156 --> 01:16:55.917]  Tell us what you saw.
[01:16:57.165 --> 01:17:09.608]  Hi, yeah, I was sitting on the left-hand side when you're looking at Trump, same side that Cory Comparatore was sitting on, and I was 20 feet to his left with my daughter and sister.
[01:17:10.468 --> 01:17:16.370]  And we heard the shots and my head immediately snapped to the right.
[01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:21.391]  You know, I don't feel like they were coming from a water tower at all.
[01:17:21.931 --> 01:17:39.659]   And everybody that was hit seemed to be hit And the perfect trajectory going from the AGR building, across, hit Corey in the back of the head, grazed Trump's ear, and then hit the other two people on the other side, plus the hydraulic line.
[01:17:40.519 --> 01:17:45.920]  Sure, so again, where are you saying, you were there, where you thought the shots came from?
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:47.160]  The AGR building.
[01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:51.381]  If there was a second shooter, it would have had to have been coming from there.
[01:17:52.148 --> 01:18:06.401]  Well, that's what most of my sources say, is they believe the open window right under where the shooter was is where the shots were, but to change the trajectory, CNN, ABC, Fox, they've all moved the shooter 50 yards another part, which is very mysterious.
[01:18:08.214 --> 01:18:08.834]  Right, right.
[01:18:08.974 --> 01:18:12.075]  I just do not think that the water power was in play at all.
[01:18:12.155 --> 01:18:14.936]  I'm hearing that a lot, and I just don't see it.
[01:18:14.996 --> 01:18:20.238]  Where we were, there was a huge tree in the way, and the bleachers were behind us.
[01:18:20.318 --> 01:18:21.258]  We were very close.
[01:18:21.298 --> 01:18:23.759]  Like, when Trump came out, he was 10 feet in front of us.
[01:18:23.839 --> 01:18:25.599]  Well, describe what it was like.
[01:18:25.739 --> 01:18:26.819]  Describe what it was like.
[01:18:26.899 --> 01:18:27.640]  You were there.
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:28.360]  What was it like?
[01:18:30.253 --> 01:18:33.935]  I mean, we were at the highest of highs right before it happened.
[01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:34.975]  He had just come out.
[01:18:35.035 --> 01:18:36.756]  He pointed at my French shirt.
[01:18:36.916 --> 01:18:38.217]  My daughter was with me.
[01:18:38.237 --> 01:18:38.477]  She's 13.
[01:18:38.557 --> 01:18:40.658]  This was her first Trump rally.
[01:18:40.718 --> 01:18:42.018]  We were like, yeah!
[01:18:42.559 --> 01:18:44.099]  And he finally started talking.
[01:18:44.159 --> 01:18:47.761]  We were all just settling in and then bang, bang, bang, bang.
[01:18:48.001 --> 01:18:55.164]  And we, like, didn't know right away what it was until Secret Service tackled him.
[01:18:55.805 --> 01:18:57.086]  And we were just in shock.
[01:18:57.106 --> 01:19:00.269]  Like, I don't think any of us really believe that's what happened.
[01:19:00.309 --> 01:19:15.803]  I mean, we did go down on the bleachers, and then my sister noticed that somebody was shot in the crowd, and at first we thought maybe somebody got a gun in there, shot at him, and then shot themselves, but obviously... Sure, well, Keith, let me ask you this.
[01:19:16.324 --> 01:19:17.685]  There's too many names to list, but...
[01:19:19.847 --> 01:19:40.862]  Joy Behar, Reed, Keith Oberman, they've all basically said that all of you were actors, and that you would have run, and obviously you're not actors, this is a public event, and that you would have run, but you're caught off by surprise, plus you're conservatives, you're not panics on a rock concert, and like you said, you were caught off guard.
[01:19:40.902 --> 01:19:48.548]  What do you want to say to people like Joy Reed and Behar and Oberman that say this was all fake?
[01:19:50.479 --> 01:19:57.361]  Um, this is 100% real and, uh, saying that, um, it's absolutely ignorant.
[01:19:57.461 --> 01:20:00.861]  I mean, Cory Comparatore was actually a neighbor of mine as well.
[01:20:00.961 --> 01:20:03.542]  So he lived less than a quarter mile up the road.
[01:20:03.602 --> 01:20:08.043]  I passed his house every day, saw him on election day when I was handing out at the polls.
[01:20:08.123 --> 01:20:09.643]  He was a very real person.
[01:20:10.583 --> 01:20:12.604]  And so am I. I mean, we have video.
[01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:14.671]  This is very real.
[01:20:14.691 --> 01:20:16.052]  Of course it is.
[01:20:16.092 --> 01:20:17.433]  You can't fake that.
[01:20:17.473 --> 01:20:18.995]  You can't fake it.
[01:20:19.355 --> 01:20:25.440]  So were you looking at Trump when he got shot or what was that like?
[01:20:26.621 --> 01:20:37.350]  Yeah, we were looking at him and then we heard the first couple shots and then my head snapped to the right because from where I was sitting, that's where the shots were coming from.
[01:20:38.031 --> 01:20:41.654]  And Corey was 20 feet to my right, obviously in the line of fire.
[01:20:42.501 --> 01:20:51.164]  And so, I immediately knew which direction they came from, and me, my sister, my daughter, we all looked that way, and then we just went down.
[01:20:51.704 --> 01:20:55.385]  And then Trump went down, and then we weren't even sure if he was okay.
[01:20:55.425 --> 01:20:58.846]  We were all panicking, thinking he might have got, like, seriously wounded.
[01:20:58.886 --> 01:20:59.946]  And Trump talked about that.
[01:21:00.006 --> 01:21:06.929]  He's looking out for the 20 seconds they're holding him down, and he tells them, get off me, because he sees everybody panic, and he pops up and says, fight, fight, fight.
[01:21:06.969 --> 01:21:07.829]  That is so real.
[01:21:08.109 --> 01:21:09.950]  You can't fake something that's that real.
[01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:11.230]  That's why it's so powerful.
[01:21:12.344 --> 01:21:12.624]  Right.
[01:21:12.725 --> 01:21:20.194]  And I kind of missed that moment, too, because I was still just sitting there in shock going, what is happening right now?
[01:21:20.234 --> 01:21:22.177]  We didn't know where it was coming from.
[01:21:22.297 --> 01:21:22.938]  Who did it?
[01:21:22.998 --> 01:21:24.220]  Was it somebody in the crowd?
[01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:25.661]  It was just chaos.
[01:21:26.022 --> 01:21:28.645]  And then on our way out, we heard 10, 15, 20 different stories.
[01:21:31.221 --> 01:21:35.783]  I mean, people did not know what happened unless you were like right down in there.
[01:21:35.984 --> 01:21:36.704]  But you were there.
[01:21:37.264 --> 01:21:38.505]  We were a little confused.
[01:21:39.365 --> 01:21:42.947]  I want to get your name and number to have you back on as a guest because you were there as a witness.
[01:21:43.327 --> 01:21:45.108]  Were you able to get any video in the aftermath?
[01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.509]  Yes.
[01:21:46.789 --> 01:21:49.811]  Yeah, my daughter got a couple videos of the aftermath.
[01:21:50.111 --> 01:21:50.951]  Have you put those out?
[01:21:52.472 --> 01:21:57.154]  I put them on Twitter, or X, and I actually tagged you in some last week.
[01:21:57.174 --> 01:21:58.575]  Well, I'm sorry we missed those.
[01:21:58.595 --> 01:21:59.436]  What is your X account?
[01:21:59.456 --> 01:21:59.956]  We'll find them.
[01:22:01.301 --> 01:22:03.082]  Uh, it is Holly Lama.
[01:22:05.222 --> 01:22:07.283]  H-O-L-L-I-L-A-M-A.
[01:22:07.583 --> 01:22:09.303]  We're going to find those and post those.
[01:22:09.643 --> 01:22:10.403]  Sorry I missed them.
[01:22:10.704 --> 01:22:12.104]  We'll get your contact info.
[01:22:12.144 --> 01:22:14.044]  Holly, thank you and God bless you, you didn't get hurt.
[01:22:14.445 --> 01:22:15.525]  Wow, what an amazing moment.
[01:22:15.545 --> 01:22:17.105]  Does this make you a bigger Trump supporter?
[01:22:18.446 --> 01:22:19.086]  Absolutely.
[01:22:19.826 --> 01:22:20.546]  Bigger than ever.
[01:22:20.566 --> 01:22:21.226]  Yeah.
[01:22:22.167 --> 01:22:23.727]  You're a combat veteran now, sweetheart.
[01:22:24.227 --> 01:22:25.187]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:22:25.207 --> 01:22:25.848]  What an incredible lady.
[01:22:25.868 --> 01:22:27.268]  We'll go to law enforcement straight ahead.
[01:22:28.854 --> 01:22:31.095]  Stay with us, please follow me on Instagram, Alex Jones.
[01:22:31.395 --> 01:22:32.576]  It's been sold out for a while.
[01:22:32.836 --> 01:22:35.337]  It is pure deep earth crystal iodine.
[01:22:35.497 --> 01:22:36.498]  It's so hard to make.
[01:22:36.558 --> 01:22:38.479]  You've got to have DEA approved labs to do it.
[01:22:38.599 --> 01:22:42.400]  And it takes months and months to break it down in this special patented process.
[01:22:42.941 --> 01:22:45.002]  Nobody else has true nascent iodine.
[01:22:45.342 --> 01:22:48.723]  They put it on the label, but it's still bound to other elements.
[01:22:49.144 --> 01:22:50.985]  And it's not fully absorbable by the cells.
[01:22:51.145 --> 01:22:52.025]  It's the missing link.
[01:22:52.145 --> 01:22:55.887]  Even the UN estimates two plus billion people have cognitive disabilities because of iodine.
[01:22:56.027 --> 01:23:00.226]   deficiency up until the 30s we had major IQ reduction because of lack of iodine
[01:23:00.226 --> 01:23:04.587]   in the US food supply especially in the US Midwest from the 30s to the early 80s
[01:23:04.587 --> 01:23:10.306]   the government put crappy iodine in the salt by law and IQs went up 15 points on
[01:23:10.306 --> 01:23:13.787]   average, Merton effects went way down in the early 80s they took it out again.
[01:23:13.787 --> 01:23:17.987]   This is the deep earth crystal pure meaning atomic on the atomic table and
[01:23:17.987 --> 01:23:28.606]   it goes into the cells at a cellular level Survival Shield X2, now available 25% off, InfoWarsStore.com, 5-star review, or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:23:28.426 --> 01:23:36.826]  388-253-3139.
[01:23:36.867 --> 01:23:37.947]  Freedom creates decadence.
[01:23:39.008 --> 01:23:40.328]  Hard times make strong men.
[01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:41.808]  Strong men make good times.
[01:23:42.068 --> 01:23:43.168]  Good times make weak men.
[01:23:43.208 --> 01:23:44.229]  Weak men make bad times.
[01:23:45.249 --> 01:23:49.490]  That the general public, men and women, are not ready for what's going down and what's happening.
[01:23:51.130 --> 01:23:53.710]  The deep state 100% didn't stand down.
[01:23:53.770 --> 01:23:55.571]  They 100% tried to kill Trump.
[01:23:56.271 --> 01:23:58.231]  They're 100% even more desperate now.
[01:23:58.751 --> 01:24:00.052]  Who knows what's happened to Biden?
[01:24:00.812 --> 01:24:01.952]  We're in the middle of a live coup.
[01:24:02.819 --> 01:24:06.536]  And I'm in the center of the attack, so I'm not happy about this.
[01:24:06.917 --> 01:24:07.741]  I want stability.
[01:24:08.823 --> 01:24:09.663]  And prosperity.
[01:24:10.463 --> 01:24:14.184]  And we can go to our jobs, and go to church, and go to work, and go play golf, and do all this.
[01:24:14.744 --> 01:24:16.164]  That's all out the door, folks.
[01:24:16.765 --> 01:24:24.786]  Because we got so focused on the golf, and so focused on the movies, and so focused on our buddies, and bass fishing.
[01:24:24.806 --> 01:24:25.606]  And I get it, it's great.
[01:24:26.226 --> 01:24:28.667]  Believe me, I'm as good at screwing around as anybody.
[01:24:29.067 --> 01:24:33.668]  I'm not judging anybody that wants to go, you know, eat chicken fried steaks and drink a 12 pack of beer.
[01:24:36.116 --> 01:24:41.619]  Or spend a whole week on some hunting lodge and just sit around and, you know, play cards and shoot deer.
[01:24:43.881 --> 01:24:46.562]  But while we were doing that, the evil people took over.
[01:24:48.964 --> 01:24:52.426]  And so, the situation we're in is so dire.
[01:24:53.646 --> 01:24:56.048]  Good news is I talked to the high-level Trump people.
[01:24:56.068 --> 01:24:58.349]  They're dialed in, so I feel good about that.
[01:24:59.490 --> 01:25:00.150]  They got a plan.
[01:25:00.931 --> 01:25:04.973]  But I just want the public to know, you better get your shit together right now.
[01:25:06.653 --> 01:25:10.254]  Because we are in a world of hurt.
[01:25:11.915 --> 01:25:13.676]  And people are getting all celebratory.
[01:25:14.056 --> 01:25:18.678]  I've got the established publications, Atlantic Monthly, New York Times, Financial Times, just the three I saw.
[01:25:19.378 --> 01:25:20.419]  Oh, Trump's overconfident.
[01:25:20.439 --> 01:25:20.979]  We're going to get him.
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:24.820]  They got major tricks up their sleeves.
[01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:30.763]  So if you think we're out of the woods, just as we had this big victory, we're in halftime right now.
[01:25:32.244 --> 01:25:34.728]   And yeah, we're Seven points ahead.
[01:25:35.409 --> 01:25:35.929]  We're ahead!
[01:25:36.269 --> 01:25:36.589]  Great!
[01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:37.109]  We're ahead!
[01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.449]  Great!
[01:25:37.529 --> 01:25:38.050]  Wonderful!
[01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:45.953]  So, if you don't think we've got a whole nother half a football game to play here, you're a dumbass.
[01:25:46.813 --> 01:25:51.335]  And that's all I'm trying to say is, the other team is gonna play dirty, and they own the referees.
[01:25:52.456 --> 01:25:53.376]  So we gotta play harder.
[01:25:53.676 --> 01:25:55.377]  We gotta decide we're not gonna get beat.
[01:25:55.737 --> 01:25:58.358]  We gotta go out there, eye of the tiger, and beat their ass.
[01:25:59.918 --> 01:26:02.278]  politically, in the information war.
[01:26:02.278 --> 01:26:08.559]   They got false flags ready, they got race war ready, they got it all ready, they got their assassin teams ready.
[01:26:08.559 --> 01:26:11.639]  I mean, I've had to literally just get ready myself.
[01:26:11.639 --> 01:26:14.538]  'Cause I'm not stupid.
[01:26:14.538 --> 01:26:17.318]  I'm able to make a lot of predictions.
[01:26:17.318 --> 01:26:22.117]   And I'm sitting there talking to the White House advisors on Trump's security, they're like, how's your security?
[01:26:22.117 --> 01:26:23.797]  You know, they're coming after you, right?
[01:26:23.797 --> 01:26:25.117]  I'm like, I don't need you to tell me that.
[01:26:25.117 --> 01:26:26.479]  Yeah, I know that, okay?
[01:26:27.938 --> 01:26:30.818]  So, this is game time people.
[01:26:32.852 --> 01:26:36.134]  This isn't watching a TV show on HBO.
[01:26:36.194 --> 01:26:37.994]  This is the real world.
[01:26:38.935 --> 01:26:40.235]  This isn't some drama.
[01:26:40.675 --> 01:26:42.256]  It's not some theater production.
[01:26:42.936 --> 01:26:44.296]  This is the real world.
[01:26:49.198 --> 01:26:50.419]  Trump's 104 days out.
[01:26:50.439 --> 01:26:53.480]  105 days out.
[01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:54.160]  79 days after that.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:55.120]  I'm going to stop ranting.
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:55.961]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:26:56.361 --> 01:26:57.221]  I appreciate everybody holding.
[01:26:58.461 --> 01:26:59.842]  We're seeing all the order they received here.
[01:27:01.516 --> 01:27:06.798]  Let's talk to, uh, who's up first here on the list?
[01:27:06.818 --> 01:27:07.818]  Who's holding the longest?
[01:27:07.838 --> 01:27:12.120]  All right, we're going to talk to folks in Massachusetts.
[01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:14.200]  We'll talk to Michael in Boston.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:14.740]  You're on the air.
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:15.321]  Go ahead, Michael.
[01:27:15.801 --> 01:27:17.801]  You're a military marine sniper.
[01:27:17.821 --> 01:27:18.162]  Go ahead.
[01:27:19.062 --> 01:27:19.522]  Hi, Alex.
[01:27:19.602 --> 01:27:20.903]  Thanks for letting me on your show.
[01:27:21.303 --> 01:27:25.204]  I pray for you every day because I can only imagine the amount of pressure you're under.
[01:27:26.381 --> 01:27:27.741]  Thank you for the prayer, Michael.
[01:27:28.321 --> 01:27:28.922]  Believe me.
[01:27:28.982 --> 01:27:29.622]  Thank you, sir.
[01:27:29.702 --> 01:27:30.162]  I need that.
[01:27:30.242 --> 01:27:30.642]  Thank you.
[01:27:31.482 --> 01:27:33.243]  We spoke the day the bridge collapsed.
[01:27:33.283 --> 01:27:35.363]  I'm also a union eye worker.
[01:27:35.403 --> 01:27:39.644]  I called in and I was getting into how big a project it was going to be and how long it was going to be.
[01:27:39.664 --> 01:27:40.704]  I remember.
[01:27:40.724 --> 01:27:46.806]  Yeah, well, as a former Marine sniper, there's so many things that bother me about this, but I'll make it quick because I know there's other calls.
[01:27:46.826 --> 01:27:48.546]  The top three is, one, the open window.
[01:27:48.686 --> 01:27:53.027]  I didn't even know about that until yesterday when you spoke on it on your show.
[01:27:53.743 --> 01:27:57.344]  I didn't know there was an open window, you know, X amount of feet away.
[01:27:57.364 --> 01:28:03.685]  I mean, that kind of falls in line with, you know, the side the shot came from, so they can, you know, they have the deniability that it was the kid.
[01:28:04.485 --> 01:28:06.345]  The second thing is the water tower.
[01:28:06.385 --> 01:28:10.566]  I'm hearing things about, I think it was Greg Reese saying that there was a shadow that stood up.
[01:28:10.926 --> 01:28:14.747]  Oh, it's not just a shadow, because they see all the shadow forms, shadows form.
[01:28:15.027 --> 01:28:16.167]  They don't pop right up.
[01:28:16.207 --> 01:28:16.767]  It's a man.
[01:28:16.787 --> 01:28:19.068]  Yeah, something makes a shadow.
[01:28:19.328 --> 01:28:20.988]  An object creates a shadow, right?
[01:28:22.196 --> 01:28:33.585]  Number two is that with the flash or the reflection of the sun on the scope, whatever, that number two, I don't know if there's any footage available because I haven't been able to find anything on that.
[01:28:33.905 --> 01:28:34.806]  But here's the third one.
[01:28:34.826 --> 01:28:37.929]  Do you remember how Trump supporters were filming the kid?
[01:28:38.069 --> 01:28:42.772]  Like there's a guy on the roof and you see cell phone footage of him, you know, slow crawling up the roof.
[01:28:43.193 --> 01:28:43.653]  Remember that?
[01:28:43.673 --> 01:28:43.653]  2020?
[01:28:45.755 --> 01:28:48.717]  They now admit 26 minutes they sat there and let him do that.
[01:28:48.737 --> 01:28:49.458]  I mean, come on.
[01:28:50.342 --> 01:28:51.284]  Right, but here's the thing.
[01:28:51.485 --> 01:28:53.730]  This just came to me yesterday morning.
[01:28:54.692 --> 01:28:56.256]  They were filming him, right, on the roof.
[01:28:56.396 --> 01:28:57.719]  He's low crawling with his weapon.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.326]  Alright, so are you going to tell me those are Trump supporters?
[01:29:01.477 --> 01:29:03.158]  Why would they have stopped filming?
[01:29:03.378 --> 01:29:07.199]  What I'm starting to think, what I'm getting at is I don't even know if the kid ever even got any shots off.
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:09.981]  I think it was someone else and they just shot him dead.
[01:29:10.341 --> 01:29:12.161]  Because why would those people have stopped?
[01:29:12.181 --> 01:29:14.262]  Are you telling me the Trump supporters would have stopped filming?
[01:29:14.582 --> 01:29:17.124]  We don't have any footage of the kid firing off any rounds.
[01:29:17.544 --> 01:29:19.144]  Why would they have all stopped filming?
[01:29:19.184 --> 01:29:20.765]  I mean, that just doesn't make sense to me, right?
[01:29:20.945 --> 01:29:22.766]  The whole thing's a no press conference.
[01:29:23.905 --> 01:29:27.529]  Yeah, and they've had the weapon the whole time, so they can come out and say anything they want.
[01:29:27.609 --> 01:29:30.131]  Oh yeah, he fired shots, there's carbon in there.
[01:29:30.211 --> 01:29:33.074]  Even if he didn't, they can fire a few rounds out of it and go, here, see?
[01:29:33.294 --> 01:29:34.295]  It was freshly fired.
[01:29:34.476 --> 01:29:34.976]  You know what I mean?
[01:29:34.996 --> 01:29:36.077]  They're controlling the narrative.
[01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:43.084]  I agree, and the fact that they tried to kill Trump, he's so popular, well now he's even more popular, what are they going to do?
[01:29:43.124 --> 01:29:44.446]  It's not a hard deduction.
[01:29:44.466 --> 01:29:45.647]  They're going to try to kill him again.
[01:29:46.690 --> 01:29:46.890]  Yeah.
[01:29:47.210 --> 01:29:55.592]  Oh, dude, I'm so like, I had to add Elon Musk to my prayer list, because I pray, we talked about it before several times a day, and I'm a little older than you, Alex.
[01:29:55.652 --> 01:29:56.313]  I'm 60.
[01:29:56.913 --> 01:30:00.154]  And this, what's going on right now in my country is rocking me to my core.
[01:30:00.194 --> 01:30:05.115]  So with all you're into, I don't even know how you're holding up, brother man, but you are in my prayers every day.
[01:30:06.375 --> 01:30:07.836]  I'm only holding up because of you, brother.
[01:30:07.956 --> 01:30:08.656]  Thank you so much.
[01:30:09.557 --> 01:30:10.638]  We love you, man.
[01:30:10.658 --> 01:30:11.238]  I love you, too.
[01:30:11.298 --> 01:30:11.939]  I need the prayers.
[01:30:11.999 --> 01:30:15.621]  I can't get into it, but it's... Because I'm not that important at the end of the day.
[01:30:15.801 --> 01:30:24.227]  They want to mess with me to get me to focus on myself instead of them, but yeah, it's bad.
[01:30:25.208 --> 01:30:27.069]  I can't imagine what Trump's under, his whole family.
[01:30:27.329 --> 01:30:29.490]  It's just... These cowards.
[01:30:29.570 --> 01:30:30.631]  They're scum.
[01:30:31.332 --> 01:30:34.574]  They're total filth, but just like Trump, we're going to keep attacking back.
[01:30:35.034 --> 01:30:35.815]  We're going to push through.
[01:30:35.835 --> 01:30:36.415]  We're going to win.
[01:30:36.455 --> 01:30:37.176]  And they can feel it.
[01:30:37.216 --> 01:30:38.176]  We are winning.
[01:30:38.536 --> 01:30:39.177]  Make no mistake.
[01:30:40.410 --> 01:30:41.551]  Right now, I'm getting chills right now.
[01:30:41.611 --> 01:30:42.392]  We are winning!
[01:30:44.893 --> 01:30:45.554]  We are winning.
[01:30:46.495 --> 01:30:47.876]  But it doesn't mean this thing's in the bag.
[01:30:48.416 --> 01:30:53.340]  Alright, let's go to Baltimore, Maryland and talk to Joe, Military, Marine, Afghanistan.
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:54.901]  What's your view on this, sir?
[01:30:54.921 --> 01:30:57.563]  Alright, good afternoon.
[01:30:57.583 --> 01:30:58.944]  Alright?
[01:30:59.424 --> 01:31:00.185]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[01:31:00.205 --> 01:31:01.446]  This is a 100% setup.
[01:31:06.383 --> 01:31:15.786]  Couple years ago, there was a guy on your show, you went to some rally, and there was a communist who started shoving you, and I was in the Marines with that guy.
[01:31:15.987 --> 01:31:19.268]  He got kicked out because he was a communist.
[01:31:20.048 --> 01:31:35.254]  He made it all the way through boot camp, all the way through infantry training, went to an infantry unit, and then he was making detailed plans of the base and giving details to somebody, and they caught him and arrested him and kicked him out.
[01:31:35.714 --> 01:31:40.904]   And then, When I got out in 2013, I thought you were crazy.
[01:31:41.465 --> 01:31:45.728]  And then I saw that guy on the show shoving you.
[01:31:46.288 --> 01:31:47.109]  And I tried to call.
[01:31:47.129 --> 01:31:48.129]  I didn't make it.
[01:31:48.489 --> 01:31:49.210]  So I just let it go.
[01:31:49.230 --> 01:31:52.412]  Are you talking about when the communists attacked me in Cleveland?
[01:31:52.432 --> 01:31:54.613]  Yeah, that's probably what it is.
[01:31:54.674 --> 01:31:55.474]  I think it was Cleveland.
[01:31:55.934 --> 01:31:58.876]  Yeah, I used to call him Elephant Ears because he was a weirdo.
[01:31:59.437 --> 01:32:01.398]  And everybody made fun of him because he was a weirdo.
[01:32:01.438 --> 01:32:02.899]  And it turned out he was a communist.
[01:32:02.959 --> 01:32:03.940]  Made perfect sense.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.921]  So I need everybody to understand.
[01:32:06.761 --> 01:32:13.786]  If there are people willing to go through Marine Corps boot camp, which is living hell on earth, okay?
[01:32:14.046 --> 01:32:19.710]  And then go through the infantry training and make it all the way to a fleet unit, okay?
[01:32:19.730 --> 01:32:22.592]  This takes months, even over a year.
[01:32:22.632 --> 01:32:24.513]  This guy was in for over a year, okay?
[01:32:24.933 --> 01:32:30.477]  So, my thing is, anybody who thinks that this is just a coincidence, no.
[01:32:30.858 --> 01:32:33.960]  There are people, and this guy was, see, he was an idiot.
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:35.881]  He was no intelligent guy.
[01:32:36.488 --> 01:32:37.509]  But let's just say this.
[01:32:38.109 --> 01:32:45.633]  Take the psychopaths that have more intelligence and the ability to put all the pieces together.
[01:32:46.153 --> 01:32:47.734]  It's real people.
[01:32:48.114 --> 01:32:49.335]  You need to wake up.
[01:32:50.455 --> 01:32:55.278]  The people who want us gone are willing to go through boot camp.
[01:32:56.164 --> 01:32:59.445]  Go through infantry training and live amongst you.
[01:32:59.505 --> 01:33:04.467]  So there are people amongst you who are taking detailed plans of our society.
[01:33:04.587 --> 01:33:07.688]  And there are millions of military age men led in the last three and a half years.
[01:33:08.808 --> 01:33:09.288]  Exactly.
[01:33:09.508 --> 01:33:11.369]  And everybody needs to know this.
[01:33:12.649 --> 01:33:27.151]   That if you're a citizen, You better know now that all the fun times, and all the Friday night parties, and all the cheap gas, yeah, guess what, millennials?
[01:33:27.752 --> 01:33:29.113]  Yeah, they shorted us.
[01:33:29.733 --> 01:33:31.655]  And they tried to kill our president.
[01:33:32.155 --> 01:33:35.178]  And it's not about, oh, you know, they just don't like Trump.
[01:33:35.578 --> 01:33:35.758]  No.
[01:33:36.759 --> 01:33:39.301]  You want to talk about- They don't like us.
[01:33:39.361 --> 01:33:40.022]  They don't like us.
[01:33:40.042 --> 01:33:40.863]  They don't like us.
[01:33:41.723 --> 01:33:43.865]  And I told people this in 2013.
[01:33:45.382 --> 01:33:51.144]   When Marilyn changed the gun wall, And they were trying to say they were going to take away AR-15s, whatever.
[01:33:51.544 --> 01:33:53.785]  And they made it easier to buy those over-the-counter, right?
[01:33:54.466 --> 01:33:57.007]  But to me, I said, this doesn't make any sense.
[01:33:57.347 --> 01:34:09.233]  And I started telling everybody I could that there's something wrong, the government is lying, and I know for my own eyes that the war in Afghanistan, hey, well, how many of my friends are dead from heroin?
[01:34:09.694 --> 01:34:12.735]  Oh, how many are dead from Oxycontin?
[01:34:13.255 --> 01:34:16.037]  Oh, my whole generation got taken out.
[01:34:16.617 --> 01:34:17.117]  On drugs.
[01:34:17.217 --> 01:34:17.677]  And guess what?
[01:34:18.218 --> 01:34:23.599]  All the people that are on drugs, they're just, they're mind-numbing everybody.
[01:34:23.899 --> 01:34:27.480]  Through TV, through music, through celebrity stuff.
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:28.280]  I agree.
[01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:29.261]  We're going to jump to the caller.
[01:34:29.341 --> 01:34:30.981]  So what do you think comes next, Joe?
[01:34:32.542 --> 01:34:40.084]  I think that they are going to push something else and the next time, they're going to start trying to kill everybody.
[01:34:40.164 --> 01:34:42.264]  I mean... Well look, look, look.
[01:34:42.284 --> 01:34:44.105]  They're going to false flag and blow up.
[01:34:45.296 --> 01:34:46.476]  Minority events.
[01:34:47.137 --> 01:34:48.017]  And blame it on Trump.
[01:34:48.077 --> 01:34:48.537]  God bless you.
[01:34:48.577 --> 01:34:49.057]  Thanks for the call.
[01:34:49.358 --> 01:34:50.438]  That's their next move, folks.
[01:34:50.458 --> 01:34:52.179]  And I don't like making these predictions.
[01:34:52.939 --> 01:34:54.479]  All the arrows point there.
[01:34:54.539 --> 01:34:55.380]  It's not hard.
[01:34:56.860 --> 01:34:57.581]  It's not hard.
[01:34:58.441 --> 01:35:00.702]  How do I predict Biden will step down on the 2021st?
[01:35:01.302 --> 01:35:02.322]  I said about two weeks.
[01:35:02.903 --> 01:35:03.863]  I can see the lines.
[01:35:04.363 --> 01:35:04.763]  It's done.
[01:35:05.724 --> 01:35:06.364]  He might be dead.
[01:35:06.384 --> 01:35:06.864]  We don't know.
[01:35:08.665 --> 01:35:10.205]  The globalists already have their coup.
[01:35:10.925 --> 01:35:12.026]  We're trying to struggle.
[01:35:14.005 --> 01:35:16.286]  To get the country back, and they're trying to stop us.
[01:35:18.308 --> 01:35:20.429]  David Indiana, Military Army on Trump shooting.
[01:35:20.469 --> 01:35:21.230]  Go ahead, thanks for holding.
[01:35:22.971 --> 01:35:25.132]  Hey Alex, thanks for letting me call in.
[01:35:25.172 --> 01:35:26.573]  I appreciate everything that you do.
[01:35:27.654 --> 01:35:29.895]  So a couple quick points real fast.
[01:35:30.256 --> 01:35:36.420]  Number one, when I was in the military we learned how to set up a perimeter, so trying to protect an asset.
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:39.181]  Not too hard, you gotta think like the threat, right?
[01:35:39.221 --> 01:35:45.273]   So look at areas that You would be engaging if you were to, you know, flip roles.
[01:35:46.313 --> 01:35:51.856]  So that, and then counter-snipers, they're not there just to react to a threat.
[01:35:51.876 --> 01:35:55.198]  They're actually there to think like a threat and then act beforehand.
[01:35:55.599 --> 01:36:05.624]  So when you have these snipers that are just in one location, like next to and slightly behind Trump, yeah, I absolutely think that this was an inside thing.
[01:36:06.004 --> 01:36:09.066]  I mean, that's the only thing that makes sense, really, at this point.
[01:36:10.427 --> 01:36:26.857]  Number two, the caliper of a weapon being used, whether it was the fella on the rooftop or if it was a second or third shooter, if it's suppressed, for instance, like a .300 Blackout round that's subsonic suppressed, you can barely hear that when you're standing next to it.
[01:36:27.238 --> 01:36:39.285]  So when you have these people out there doing all these analysis of the sound, of the bang, of the gunshots going off, I mean, there's a lot of variables that play into that.
[01:36:39.570 --> 01:36:43.730]  And then number three, continued threat on Trump.
[01:36:43.730 --> 01:36:48.770]   Obviously, they're going to continue to try to take Trump out by any means necessary,
[01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:56.449]   which I also believe that would lead to them trying to take out Kamala Harris.
[01:36:56.449 --> 01:36:57.690]  Pray that that doesn't happen.
[01:36:57.690 --> 01:36:58.690]  Pray that it doesn't happen.
[01:36:58.690 --> 01:37:02.129]  I haven't covered that yet, but I totally agree.
[01:37:02.129 --> 01:37:05.050]  Because again, I know how to follow the enemy transmissions.
[01:37:05.025 --> 01:37:15.953]  They are, while they put her forward, all the big politicos have their surrogates supporting her, but they're holding back, and they're starting the demonization of her.
[01:37:16.533 --> 01:37:17.834]  Who do you think they're going to try to insert?
[01:37:19.815 --> 01:37:29.302]  I could see Hillary, and that's probably choice number one, two, and three for them is Hillary, Hillary, and then Hillary.
[01:37:31.670 --> 01:37:34.352]  And you saw the articles promoting her the last 48 hours, right?
[01:37:35.553 --> 01:37:36.134]  Absolutely.
[01:37:36.274 --> 01:37:41.278]  Oh yeah, they've been talking about why Hillary's needed more now than ever and all this.
[01:37:41.338 --> 01:37:42.038]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:37:42.058 --> 01:37:43.580]  They're just trying to promote that, get her.
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:44.120]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:46.082]  Folks, none of these people are on their own.
[01:37:46.122 --> 01:37:47.743]  Like, when I do a show, I think this.
[01:37:48.203 --> 01:37:50.405]  Other conservative shows, they're not getting orders.
[01:37:51.366 --> 01:37:55.749]  But liberals, they follow, that's one of their strengths, actually, is they are following orders.
[01:37:56.150 --> 01:38:00.256]   Like, every Democrat I absolutely agree.
[01:38:00.076 --> 01:38:05.755]   precinct in the US endorsed her unanimously. That shows cult-like control.
[01:38:05.755 --> 01:38:10.716]   And so the fact that those groups promoting Hillary means they're gonna
[01:38:10.716 --> 01:38:15.595]   try her doesn't mean she's gonna get it but they're definitely trying her.
[01:38:15.595 --> 01:38:20.595]   Yeah, I absolutely agree. I appreciate all that you do but those were the points I wanted to make.
[01:38:20.595 --> 01:38:23.795]  God bless you brother.
[01:38:21.902 --> 01:38:22.482]  Thanks for calling.
[01:38:23.022 --> 01:38:24.003]  Let's keep going with these calls.
[01:38:24.063 --> 01:38:27.066]  Quickly, Woody is law enforcement on the Trump shooting.
[01:38:27.106 --> 01:38:27.986]  Woody, thanks for calling.
[01:38:28.587 --> 01:38:29.808]  And from Washington, you're on the air.
[01:38:31.329 --> 01:38:31.889]  Hey, Alex.
[01:38:31.929 --> 01:38:32.690]  How you doing today?
[01:38:33.671 --> 01:38:35.472]  In the middle of the battle for the Republic, brother.
[01:38:35.572 --> 01:38:36.233]  We're here.
[01:38:36.273 --> 01:38:37.373]  We stayed on air until this point.
[01:38:37.413 --> 01:38:37.974]  It's only God.
[01:38:39.535 --> 01:38:47.201]  Well, I just want to tell you that I'm from Chicago and I was on security detail in Chicago many years ago when Harold Washington was running for re-election.
[01:38:48.041 --> 01:38:52.765]  And they put him in hostile territory, and they had very little security for him.
[01:38:52.785 --> 01:39:05.776]  And I was part of that detail, and I was thinking, I'm one of two people that's got to keep an eye on approximately 300 people, and not many of those 300 people liked him.
[01:39:06.777 --> 01:39:11.781]  And fortunately, it worked out where nothing happened, but this is the MO.
[01:39:13.789 --> 01:39:18.971]  You're running for president, or governor, or senator, or mayor, or whatever it is.
[01:39:19.611 --> 01:39:28.034]  If you're fighting the establishment power base, the first thing you've really got to be in charge of yourself is your security.
[01:39:28.854 --> 01:39:31.415]  And Trump put way too much faith in the Secret Service.
[01:39:32.856 --> 01:39:33.756]  He should have known better.
[01:39:33.796 --> 01:39:35.517]  The people around him should have known better.
[01:39:35.577 --> 01:39:41.979]  He should have had people watching the Secret Service and letting him know what's going on.
[01:39:42.837 --> 01:39:48.739]  And, you know, these people that are in the Secret Service, they're compartmentalized.
[01:39:49.119 --> 01:39:56.702]  They're not people that are going to lay down their lives for someone that maybe they don't even politically agree with.
[01:39:57.562 --> 01:40:00.803]  So, you know, Trump's in big danger.
[01:40:00.823 --> 01:40:06.345]  I think your analysis about poisoning next is very, very, very real.
[01:40:07.125 --> 01:40:09.686]  Maybe even a TWA-800 missile to take down his plane.
[01:40:13.972 --> 01:40:23.975]  So we're in that era now of political assassinations, and the Civil War scenario looks like it's going to play out if they succeed in doing this.
[01:40:24.815 --> 01:40:34.798]  And all Americans need to really wake up, smell the coffee, and realize we have had a hostile takeover of all of our institutions and our government.
[01:40:35.818 --> 01:40:36.199]  Absolutely.
[01:40:36.239 --> 01:40:41.281]   I've had families say, Hey, why don't we go to Nashville next month and see a music?
[01:40:41.962 --> 01:40:44.385]  And I'm like, we're not doing that.
[01:40:44.505 --> 01:40:47.048]  They're like, well, well, you don't want to live in fear.
[01:40:47.068 --> 01:40:48.189]  And I'm like, I'm not living in fear.
[01:40:48.450 --> 01:40:49.431]  We're in a war.
[01:40:49.451 --> 01:40:51.974]  I mean, it's going down.
[01:40:52.074 --> 01:40:53.996]  People better get, but don't worry.
[01:40:54.036 --> 01:40:55.618]  They'll get it once it goes over the edge.
[01:40:55.879 --> 01:40:57.641]  Cause imagine if they killed Trump.
[01:40:58.919 --> 01:41:04.042]  They were going to then trigger false flags and white conservatives, and we'd be over the edge right now.
[01:41:04.462 --> 01:41:06.003]  And look, evil's not all-powerful, folks.
[01:41:06.043 --> 01:41:06.843]  We can stop this.
[01:41:07.484 --> 01:41:15.408]  But every church, every citizen, every person better be realizing we are in the danger zone right now.
[01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:24.573]  And remember, too, they took out a sitting president once before, JFK, so they could let him get in and take him out once he's in.
[01:41:26.616 --> 01:41:27.116]  Well, that's right.
[01:41:27.156 --> 01:41:30.958]  And the Secret Service is, look, the average Secret Service agent is a nice person.
[01:41:32.179 --> 01:41:37.722]  But going back to history, it's always the Praetorian Guard that takes out Caesar.
[01:41:38.342 --> 01:41:39.243]  It's always his guards.
[01:41:39.303 --> 01:41:40.303]  It's always his best buddies.
[01:41:41.104 --> 01:41:44.065]  And anybody knows in a third world country, the number one threat is the Security Service.
[01:41:44.406 --> 01:41:45.406]  Why don't they just try to take over?
[01:41:46.327 --> 01:41:48.588]  So that's a real blind spot in a free society.
[01:41:50.023 --> 01:41:59.789]  And so we have to be fully aware of that and realize that the Secret Service's real job is getting rid of presidents from the deep state, historically.
[01:42:02.051 --> 01:42:11.797]  Well, I think they were hoping to succeed in getting Trump, and then they were probably going to take out probably either Biden or Harris in retaliation and get the Civil War going.
[01:42:12.437 --> 01:42:18.381]  But since that didn't work, now they're switching to Plan B, which may be another way.
[01:42:19.178 --> 01:42:29.447]  But in either case, President Trump would be wise to have some very trustworthy people around him watching everything the Secret Service does.
[01:42:29.788 --> 01:42:30.348]  Absolutely.
[01:42:30.368 --> 01:42:35.553]  Because Trump said, I played it last hour, he said if I would have known there was a guy running around I wouldn't have gone out.
[01:42:35.893 --> 01:42:36.714]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:42:38.135 --> 01:42:38.996]  Now, listen folks.
[01:42:39.016 --> 01:42:41.659]  I'm going to do this right now.
[01:42:43.081 --> 01:42:45.683]  And if I can do this once a day and pay the bills, I'll do it once a day.
[01:42:46.304 --> 01:42:49.707]  And I'm not bitching at anybody, but it really frustrates me.
[01:42:50.427 --> 01:43:02.897]  Because it would take me an hour to explain all this, but the CRO that was court appointed, that was fired by the court, who was a Democrat, black ops, you know, minion in my view, with the Justice Department, sabotaged this place last year and a half.
[01:43:05.379 --> 01:43:12.634]   And so, X2, X3, DNA Force Plus, Biomineral Fusion Product sells out by tomorrow.
[01:43:15.215 --> 01:43:16.195]  All of it is selling out.
[01:43:16.215 --> 01:43:21.296]  And when that sells out, and we're barely in the black, we're done.
[01:43:23.117 --> 01:43:27.478]  So they shot at us and missed, but they shit at us and hit, is an old Wisconsin saying, I'm told.
[01:43:28.518 --> 01:43:43.983]   But the point is, is that I've got to think of some new way to get money in here, because without getting into an hour-long discussion, the judge is going to keep us open, he's going to allow the company And the assets to be transferred very soon, the next few months, and we'll stay on air.
[01:43:44.343 --> 01:43:48.225]  And I'll go somewhere else and I'll still be on air, but it'll disrupt us and it'll screw the crew over.
[01:43:48.566 --> 01:43:50.627]  We don't want them to have the victory of shut down InfoWars.
[01:43:51.387 --> 01:43:59.932]  So, the missing link, the weak link, the chink in the armor, is InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:43:59.992 --> 01:44:08.216]  The good news is, two years ago, I learned who we were getting most of our supplement raw materials from, but I wanted a better deal on tumeric.
[01:44:09.361 --> 01:44:13.705]  Because we have a 95% cumanoid, and I said, well, what's the company that sells that to the company that makes it?
[01:44:14.306 --> 01:44:16.789]  And we found out, and I called the company head two years ago.
[01:44:17.429 --> 01:44:20.572]  They said, yeah, we're making like half the ingredients for your products.
[01:44:21.393 --> 01:44:22.354]  We don't want to be put on the air.
[01:44:22.394 --> 01:44:23.495]  We're listeners, the owner.
[01:44:23.515 --> 01:44:24.116]  I talked to the owner.
[01:44:24.897 --> 01:44:27.159]  But we will private label all of this.
[01:44:28.901 --> 01:44:32.724]  And you can sell it at even a lower price to everybody.
[01:44:33.638 --> 01:44:34.798]  At InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:34.818 --> 01:44:37.859]  And I never really promoted it, but more than a dozen products are there.
[01:44:37.899 --> 01:44:38.539]  They're amazing.
[01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:42.360]  Turmeric, ashwagandha, pain relief, it's all there.
[01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:50.723]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com and get the InfoWars MD line.
[01:44:51.163 --> 01:44:55.184]  Because our products that we buy in warehouse are almost sold out.
[01:44:56.484 --> 01:45:02.826]  But this group that we drop ship from has massive supplies.
[01:45:04.187 --> 01:45:07.249]  So when the InfoWars, gee, that's Achilles heel of the bad guys.
[01:45:07.269 --> 01:45:11.812]  They thought, oh, cut all our production off, don't reorder products, kill all our sponsors.
[01:45:12.252 --> 01:45:14.013]  But ah, we had this.
[01:45:14.994 --> 01:45:22.639]  So InfoWars MD, which is amazing products, the Joint Relief Max, the Prostate Support, the Oshwagandha Gummies, the Nerve Renew.
[01:45:23.179 --> 01:45:24.440]  These are amazing products.
[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:27.442]  Go get those as a donation.
[01:45:27.482 --> 01:45:28.103]  Plus, you'll love them.
[01:45:29.263 --> 01:45:32.426]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWars MD.
[01:45:36.581 --> 01:45:47.365]  Got great collagen, mushroom max, better mood, turmeric 95, that's the same as bodies, libido RX, CBDC full spectrum, it goes on and on.
[01:45:48.406 --> 01:45:53.968]  All at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:45:54.028 --> 01:45:56.889]  The super greens, it's all there.
[01:45:57.509 --> 01:45:58.790]  InfoWarsMD.
[01:45:59.530 --> 01:46:00.570]  InfoWarsMD.
[01:46:00.630 --> 01:46:04.989]   and we need to be in the black to be able to stay on the air.
[01:46:04.989 --> 01:46:06.469]  And it'd take an hour to describe it.
[01:46:06.469 --> 01:46:07.829]  I'm not going to go through it all.
[01:46:07.829 --> 01:46:09.270]  Plus it gives away strategy.
[01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:11.109]  Just support us.
[01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:17.828]   Pray for us, spread the word, share the articles, you name it, but go to Infowarsstore.com/infowarsmd today.
[01:46:17.828 --> 01:46:22.390]   Separately, our great sponsor outside of Infowars, with all the nano silver products
[01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:25.828]  and all the other great supplements, drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:46:25.828 --> 01:46:27.390]  That's my dad's company.
[01:46:27.390 --> 01:46:30.230]  Couple years ago, he said, "They're going to shut you down."
[01:46:29.273 --> 01:46:32.374]  I'm going to go set up a warehouse with all our products.
[01:46:32.394 --> 01:46:33.154]  He helped develop them.
[01:46:33.574 --> 01:46:42.277]  Next Level Financial Energy, the Super Blue, Non-Fluoride, Nano Silver, Iodine, Peppermint, and Tea Tree Oil toothpaste.
[01:46:42.317 --> 01:46:46.399]  It's all there at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:46:47.859 --> 01:46:51.602]  I cannot fight a war against the New World Order without funding.
[01:46:52.162 --> 01:46:54.924]  They lied and said I had $400 million in the bank, all over.
[01:46:54.944 --> 01:46:58.566]  New York Times a month ago said, well, it came out in court, Jones really has nothing.
[01:46:59.286 --> 01:47:02.449]  Because I don't care about the money until I need it to stay on air.
[01:47:02.469 --> 01:47:06.191]  I got a nice house, a nice car, a small swimming pool and a hot tub.
[01:47:06.591 --> 01:47:07.552]  I got plenty of food to eat.
[01:47:07.732 --> 01:47:08.753]  I don't care.
[01:47:09.713 --> 01:47:15.157]  And they had to admit, Jones has meager... ...assets.
[01:47:15.197 --> 01:47:16.898]  Joke's on you, dumbasses.
[01:47:18.677 --> 01:47:19.857]  But they knew I never had that.
[01:47:19.877 --> 01:47:20.798]  They already knew all that.
[01:47:20.878 --> 01:47:21.538]  It's funny.
[01:47:23.058 --> 01:47:26.139]  But it's not funny when you get to the red line and don't have fuel.
[01:47:26.159 --> 01:47:30.760]  So I'm driving 100 miles an hour with almost no money in the operation.
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:34.982]  I need you to go to drjonesnaturals.com at the key junction of Battle of the Republic now.
[01:47:35.502 --> 01:47:36.402]  Thank you for your support.
[01:47:36.742 --> 01:47:37.442]  Thank you for past support.
[01:47:37.462 --> 01:47:38.703]  I want to challenge those who are on the fence.
[01:47:39.023 --> 01:47:39.823]  What are you waiting for?
[01:47:40.123 --> 01:47:42.704]  drjonesnaturals.com and infowarestore.com.
[01:47:44.591 --> 01:47:57.762]  People don't know, by the way, so, you know, and I'll say this again, that many moons ago, when I was just getting started in all of this, that I remember I used to come on with Alex in 2016 is when we started doing it.
[01:47:58.082 --> 01:47:59.603]  Met you at the RNC in Cleveland.
[01:47:59.623 --> 01:48:01.205]  We did the rally by the river.
[01:48:01.225 --> 01:48:01.685]  Yeah.
[01:48:02.246 --> 01:48:03.527]  With Roger and everyone's there.
[01:48:04.127 --> 01:48:05.548]  And Diamond and Silk were there.
[01:48:05.588 --> 01:48:06.149]  That was great.
[01:48:06.189 --> 01:48:11.413]  We're out here to spite all the threats and exercising your sacred First Amendment.
[01:48:11.493 --> 01:48:12.134]  We salute you!
[01:48:12.774 --> 01:48:16.178]  April Moore salutes you, and you are part of history.
[01:48:16.398 --> 01:48:17.279]  You are the future.
[01:48:17.199 --> 01:48:18.199]  God bless you.
[01:48:18.199 --> 01:48:20.199]  [cheering]
[01:48:20.199 --> 01:48:21.199]  USA!
[01:48:21.199 --> 01:48:22.199]  USA!
[01:48:22.199 --> 01:48:23.199]  USA!
[01:48:23.199 --> 01:48:27.199]   Back then, even before I was at One America, I used to host Hour Four.
[01:48:27.982 --> 01:48:28.502]  You remember that?
[01:48:28.682 --> 01:48:28.882]  Yeah.
[01:48:29.362 --> 01:48:31.624]  And you'd be like, and I didn't even know you back then!
[01:48:31.764 --> 01:48:34.746]  And you were, I was just some guy, and you were like, hey, your microphone's not good.
[01:48:34.766 --> 01:48:48.193]  So guys, Alex Jones sends me my first microphone that I've got set up in like a, uh, just like a spare bedroom in the house, and I'm doing it over my laptop, and he goes, oh yeah, yeah, I need someone to host Hour Four.
[01:48:48.333 --> 01:48:49.954]  So I'm like, get in there, just do it.
[01:48:49.974 --> 01:48:51.015]  He's like, what do you want me to talk about?
[01:48:51.255 --> 01:48:52.475]  As wherever you like, I gotta go.
[01:48:52.815 --> 01:48:55.816]  And I'm like, I'm just some, I'm just some guy at that point.
[01:48:55.896 --> 01:48:58.556]  You know, I had been through 2016, we had met, etc, etc.
[01:48:58.616 --> 01:48:59.657]  No, but you were a smart guy.
[01:48:59.677 --> 01:49:06.438]  But it, but it, my point though is that people don't realize how much Alex does behind the scenes to help people.
[01:49:06.698 --> 01:49:13.619]  People don't realize how much that Alex really is just, just generous with his time, generous with his resources.
[01:49:13.899 --> 01:49:17.340]  And that's a side, and by the way, spends time with your family.
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:28.627]  And, you know, something that I've always tried to say is, like, there's this media caricature of Alex Jones, and I'm like, that's not the guy that I've ever met.
[01:49:28.748 --> 01:49:29.748]  I've never met him.
[01:49:29.848 --> 01:49:31.149]  I've spent plenty of time with him.
[01:49:31.529 --> 01:49:33.030]  I've never met this guy.
[01:49:33.431 --> 01:49:34.612]  He sounds crazy.
[01:49:34.672 --> 01:49:38.774]  I don't know that I'd want to meet the guy that they take you out to be, because that's just not you.
[01:49:38.894 --> 01:49:45.699]  And so, I mean, I just want to take the opportunity real quick to just say thank you for all the help that you gave me when I was getting started.
[01:49:45.799 --> 01:49:51.501]  Well, thank you, Jack, but it wasn't because you were like, I was, you know, you were a talented, smart guy and we're making great points.
[01:49:51.521 --> 01:49:53.881]  I'm like, well, hey, you need to get on air and you need to do more.
[01:49:54.261 --> 01:49:54.962]  We're going to go to break.
[01:49:55.002 --> 01:49:55.782]  He's going to take over.
[01:49:55.802 --> 01:49:57.702]  I haven't plugged in three hours.
[01:49:57.762 --> 01:49:58.823]  If we don't do that, we'll be gone.
[01:49:59.423 --> 01:50:05.204]  Infowarsstore.com, big sale, Vitamineral Fusion back in stock, X2 back in stock.
[01:50:05.224 --> 01:50:05.865]  So pray for us.
[01:50:05.965 --> 01:50:06.705]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:50:07.265 --> 01:50:08.766]  DRJonesNaturals.com.
[01:50:08.806 --> 01:50:10.826]  My dad two years ago said they're going to shut you down.
[01:50:11.226 --> 01:50:13.007]  He went, he already developed the supplements.
[01:50:13.287 --> 01:50:14.988]  He went and set up a warehouse in North Austin.
[01:50:15.288 --> 01:50:16.428]  He's there and he was right.
[01:50:16.908 --> 01:50:18.509]  So great products there.
[01:50:18.529 --> 01:50:21.390]  We've got the Next Level foundational energy.
[01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:25.811]  We've got the 10-hour clean energy turbo force and all the nano silver products.
[01:50:26.392 --> 01:50:28.772]  We've got the rocket rest sleep in.
[01:50:28.832 --> 01:50:29.393]  So amazing.
[01:50:29.433 --> 01:50:41.561]   We've got the Alex, when you're working hard, you've got a bunch of back-to-back flights.
[01:50:42.042 --> 01:50:42.422]  What's good?
[01:50:42.462 --> 01:50:43.443]  What should I go for?
[01:50:43.463 --> 01:50:45.905]  These submarines are all so strong, I barely take them.
[01:50:46.365 --> 01:50:47.946]  But they'll really work well.
[01:50:48.146 --> 01:50:49.267]  I mean, I take them all.
[01:50:50.148 --> 01:50:51.269]  I haven't taken any today.
[01:50:51.349 --> 01:50:53.010]  I should have, because I was up until 2 a.m.
[01:50:53.050 --> 01:50:53.550]  last night.
[01:50:54.351 --> 01:50:55.592]  But they're all excellent.
[01:50:55.612 --> 01:50:56.472]  They're all just clones.
[01:50:57.733 --> 01:50:59.895]  I want to get some before I get back on that plane.
[01:50:59.915 --> 01:51:00.535]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:51:00.555 --> 01:51:02.977]  Okay, well I'm going to tell you right now what you want.
[01:51:03.037 --> 01:51:05.198]  I'm going to tell you what you want right now.
[01:51:05.359 --> 01:51:05.579]  Yeah?
[01:51:06.339 --> 01:51:08.020]  You want... No, that's Rocket Rush.
[01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:09.381]  No, no, no, no.
[01:51:09.882 --> 01:51:10.842]  We'll take that later tonight.
[01:51:10.862 --> 01:51:11.403]  You want...
[01:51:12.819 --> 01:51:14.059]  Next level foundational energy.
[01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:15.000]  There it is.
[01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:15.440]  Let me see.
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:16.780]  And there's no speed in that.
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:18.521]  It's a methyl folate to break down.
[01:51:18.601 --> 01:51:19.221]  Oh, wow.
[01:51:19.881 --> 01:51:20.341]  Oh, yeah.
[01:51:20.441 --> 01:51:23.502]  It's methyl folate to break down of what's in spinach.
[01:51:23.522 --> 01:51:24.782]  There's a lot in here, too, by the way.
[01:51:24.802 --> 01:51:25.363]  Methyl folate acid.
[01:51:25.403 --> 01:51:25.723]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:51:25.843 --> 01:51:26.603]  There's a ton in here.
[01:51:26.683 --> 01:51:27.903]  The point is, it's a great product.
[01:51:28.283 --> 01:51:31.844]  This isn't one of the ones where they, you know, put the cotton in on the top so you only get a little bit.
[01:51:31.884 --> 01:51:32.365]  This is full.
[01:51:32.505 --> 01:51:34.505]  You're not to support us.
[01:51:34.505 --> 01:51:43.104]  [MUSIC]
[01:51:43.104 --> 01:51:46.824]   So the Secret Service did not know that the gunman actually had a weapon
[01:51:46.824 --> 01:51:49.585]  before President Trump was allowed to get up on the stage.
[01:51:50.386 --> 01:51:53.512]  To the best of our knowledge and the facts that we have at this point, that is correct.
[01:51:54.935 --> 01:52:00.398]  Um, so can you answer this question, which I think is on the mind of most Americans thinking about this?
[01:52:00.858 --> 01:52:15.326]  How can a 20-year-old with his father's AR-15 assault weapon climb onto a roof with a direct 150-yard line of sight to the speaker's podium without the Secret Service or local police stopping him?
[01:52:16.604 --> 01:52:27.172]  So again, sir, I will say we are nine days out from this event, and I would like to know those answers as well, which is why we are going through these investigations to be able to determine that fully.
[01:52:27.573 --> 01:52:31.836]  And Mayorkas has appointed a bunch of Trump haters to a January 6th-style committee.
[01:52:32.537 --> 01:52:33.958]  But they screwed up bad, folks.
[01:52:34.779 --> 01:52:47.300]   I don't want to overplay how much we're winning, but we... In any fight when somebody attacks you, and they attack you, so you get a few punches in and you knock them down, Politically, you gotta go ahead and stomp the ribs.
[01:52:48.601 --> 01:52:49.862]  You gotta go ahead and kick them in the face.
[01:52:49.882 --> 01:52:52.283]  You gotta go ahead and win the fight, because they're a big, mean hombre.
[01:52:53.304 --> 01:52:54.184]  Yeah, we got them down.
[01:52:55.205 --> 01:52:56.466]  We just knocked the shit out of them.
[01:52:57.266 --> 01:52:58.067]  They're getting back up.
[01:52:58.887 --> 01:53:00.168]  You don't hesitate at this point.
[01:53:00.708 --> 01:53:02.469]  Politically, you savage their ass.
[01:53:02.489 --> 01:53:06.712]  Trump comes out, inside job, exposes it, flame throws the whole operation.
[01:53:08.053 --> 01:53:09.073]  And Trump's close to doing it.
[01:53:09.274 --> 01:53:09.714]  And then we win.
[01:53:11.465 --> 01:53:15.786]  But if he keeps sitting back and he's starting to move on this, he's in a bad position.
[01:53:16.587 --> 01:53:18.567]  My God, Trump, you got shot in the head.
[01:53:20.248 --> 01:53:21.608]  Two millimeters over, you'd have been dead.
[01:53:23.169 --> 01:53:24.769]  That bullet would have fragmented into your skull.
[01:53:25.269 --> 01:53:25.629]  Bye-bye.
[01:53:26.430 --> 01:53:27.330]  Or you'd at least been a vegetable.
[01:53:28.410 --> 01:53:28.990]  Gloves are off.
[01:53:30.471 --> 01:53:31.731]  And I know the position I'm in.
[01:53:31.851 --> 01:53:32.891]  I know they're coming for me.
[01:53:34.632 --> 01:53:36.633]  So when I see them trying to kill Trump, they're trying to kill me.
[01:53:38.093 --> 01:53:38.873]  I'm going to explain this again.
[01:53:38.913 --> 01:53:39.974]  I don't do this stuff out of courage.
[01:53:42.399 --> 01:53:46.760]  I love God and I hate evil people, so I would do it anyways if I was going to lose, because God's watching.
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:48.541]  But I'm selfish, folks.
[01:53:49.601 --> 01:53:50.521]  And I hate to lose.
[01:53:50.821 --> 01:53:53.102]  And I know I'm the target.
[01:53:53.182 --> 01:53:53.822]  You're the target.
[01:53:53.902 --> 01:53:56.803]  Like Trump says, they're not trying to get me, they're going to get me through me to get to you.
[01:53:57.363 --> 01:53:58.883]  That is the truest thing he's ever said.
[01:53:59.743 --> 01:54:01.944]  He's got to come out and say they tried to kill me to get to you.
[01:54:03.324 --> 01:54:08.305]  So when they tried to kill Trump, man, I was like, I mean, I had a, I want to call it a breakdown.
[01:54:08.345 --> 01:54:10.086]  People saw me on air and they're like, what's wrong with Alex?
[01:54:12.364 --> 01:54:13.605]  We're go our folks.
[01:54:13.665 --> 01:54:14.705]  We're in the war now.
[01:54:14.645 --> 01:54:21.444]   I mean that was me gearing up mentally for this going down and literally preparing to die
[01:54:21.444 --> 01:54:27.445]   and saying I commit and I already made the decision but it was still very physical because
[01:54:27.445 --> 01:54:33.045]   I don't make these predictions out of nowhere and I told the crew I said I'm next.
[01:54:33.045 --> 01:54:42.324]  And again, crew's like well don't make, earpiece popped out.
[01:54:42.581 --> 01:54:43.782]  Cruz is like, well don't make those predictions.
[01:54:43.922 --> 01:54:45.584]  This ain't Oprah Winfrey secret crap.
[01:54:45.604 --> 01:54:48.045]  It's not like I'm saying abracadabra.
[01:54:48.806 --> 01:54:52.129]  And then... That earpiece today has been weird.
[01:54:52.149 --> 01:54:53.230]  It's like a shorter cord.
[01:54:53.290 --> 01:54:54.010]  It keeps popping out.
[01:54:54.030 --> 01:54:55.651]  It's driving me freaking crazy.
[01:54:57.633 --> 01:54:58.474]  Oh my God.
[01:54:59.194 --> 01:54:59.595]  Oh God.
[01:54:59.635 --> 01:55:00.695]  I'm so sick of it all.
[01:55:00.755 --> 01:55:02.937]  We have such scum running things.
[01:55:02.957 --> 01:55:05.940]  You look at Biden and these lawyers and all this trash.
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:07.080]  And I got loaded phone lines.
[01:55:09.082 --> 01:55:15.027]  And Austin, and everybody else, we're going to go to an order quickly when we come back.
[01:55:15.448 --> 01:55:17.370]  And Brett, Brett's actually right after Steve.
[01:55:18.891 --> 01:55:20.512]  A lot of stations don't carry this first five.
[01:55:21.633 --> 01:55:24.776]  And during the break, we guys run in here and linked on the cord on my earpiece.
[01:55:24.816 --> 01:55:25.937]  It's like this long today.
[01:55:26.177 --> 01:55:28.460]  And it's just like, it's been popped out 15 times, driving me crazy.
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:31.342]  I'm not bitching, or I can do it myself during a one minute break.
[01:55:31.362 --> 01:55:31.803]  It's fine.
[01:55:32.023 --> 01:55:32.383]  I'll handle it.
[01:55:32.403 --> 01:55:33.744]  I'll fix it.
[01:55:37.017 --> 01:55:41.960]  I've just got trillions of data points coming in, and I know the enemy's desperate, and I know we're in a war.
[01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:47.582]  And if I can just get people to admit they're in a war, we've got a really good chance of beating these people.
[01:55:47.602 --> 01:55:53.445]  And there's nothing more frustrating than politically, we're one big giant.
[01:55:53.645 --> 01:55:54.686]  We have to all work together.
[01:55:54.786 --> 01:55:55.927]  We just beat the enemy.
[01:55:56.267 --> 01:55:57.187]  We just knocked them down.
[01:55:58.848 --> 01:56:00.229]  But the enemy's getting back up.
[01:56:00.789 --> 01:56:01.509]  And I'm like, hit!
[01:56:01.749 --> 01:56:02.090]  Attack!
[01:56:02.570 --> 01:56:03.110]  Go after them!
[01:56:03.130 --> 01:56:04.731]  They're like, oh, we just won!
[01:56:04.751 --> 01:56:05.611]  They tried to kill Trump!
[01:56:05.631 --> 01:56:06.472]  Oh, yeah!
[01:56:07.594 --> 01:56:08.855]  No, we just won one round.
[01:56:08.895 --> 01:56:12.037]  We got more rounds to go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:13.057 --> 01:56:15.359]  More rounds to go straight ahead.
[01:56:15.379 --> 01:56:17.760]  All right, your call's in 60 seconds.
[01:56:18.381 --> 01:56:20.702]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:56:20.762 --> 01:56:21.963]  Follow me on the next Alex Jones.
[01:56:22.283 --> 01:56:22.864]  We'll be right back.
[01:56:23.464 --> 01:56:23.864]  All right.
[01:56:25.445 --> 01:56:30.048]  We have so many dozens of clips from Cheadle's horrible testimony that's still ongoing.
[01:56:30.569 --> 01:56:31.649]  But I want to go back to your calls.
[01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:40.491]   But the crew did a great job on The RNC last Thursday, they put out like 50 clips, got like 30 million views, they kicked ass.
[01:56:41.312 --> 01:56:43.053]  We need to be putting all these Cheadle clips out.
[01:56:43.894 --> 01:56:48.799]  Cheadle just came out and said if Trump was killed, she still wouldn't have resigned.
[01:56:48.839 --> 01:56:56.947]  That's the arrogance of these bureaucrats and I can't wait till we take the country back and she needs to be investigated and charged and thrown under the prison.
[01:56:58.086 --> 01:56:58.766]  Disgusting.
[01:56:58.806 --> 01:57:03.707]  Here is Secret Service Chief says she would not have resigned if Trump had been killed.
[01:57:04.028 --> 01:57:06.088]  The full videos on InfoWars.com.
[01:57:06.508 --> 01:57:07.308]  Share it from there.
[01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.669]  Here she is.
[01:57:09.909 --> 01:57:17.291]  If Trump had been assassinated that day, if the gunmen had succeeded, okay, would you have come and tendered your resignation?
[01:57:19.423 --> 01:57:24.184]  I would still be sitting here because I would want to ensure the integrity of the investigation.
[01:57:24.284 --> 01:57:31.905]  But would you have had the honor to come in front of the committee and say, a president was assassinated, a former president was assassinated on my watch, there should be new leadership?
[01:57:33.325 --> 01:57:36.246]  I think that I have admitted that there was... No, no, that's what I'm asking.
[01:57:36.266 --> 01:57:38.446]  Would you have tendered your resignation if he had been killed?
[01:57:38.706 --> 01:57:41.747]  That occurred on my watch, and I am accountable for that.
[01:57:42.027 --> 01:57:44.487]  Okay, but would you have tendered your resignation if he had been killed?
[01:57:47.228 --> 01:57:56.744]   I think that Wow, even Democrats are turning against that pig.
[01:57:57.485 --> 01:57:59.146]  By the way, the crew told me they are posting it all.
[01:57:59.206 --> 01:58:00.027]  Great job, crew.
[01:58:01.128 --> 01:58:02.709]  This crew is kicking ass.
[01:58:03.449 --> 01:58:04.650]  I got like 50 other clips.
[01:58:04.710 --> 01:58:05.491]  I mean, these are insane.
[01:58:06.272 --> 01:58:09.874]  Secret Service Director refuses to say Crooks was lone gunman.
[01:58:10.175 --> 01:58:11.376]  And we'll go right back to your calls.
[01:58:12.136 --> 01:58:16.119]  Let's play Clip S. Let's see how many clips we got.
[01:58:16.139 --> 01:58:17.260]  We're almost out of the alphabet here.
[01:58:18.081 --> 01:58:18.601]  Here she is.
[01:58:20.745 --> 01:58:26.109]  Your agency has a no-fail mission, and on Saturday, July 13th, your agency spectacularly failed.
[01:58:26.709 --> 01:58:37.336]  The failure resulted in the death of Corey Compratore and serious injury to other rally attendees, David Dutch and James Copenhaver, besides the injuries to President Trump.
[01:58:37.936 --> 01:58:50.465]  It is unfathomable that a 20-year-old, on the radar of Secret Service and local law enforcement before President Trump went on stage, was able to climb onto the roof of a building with a rifle and fire off multiple rounds before he was neutralized.
[01:58:51.265 --> 01:58:53.067]  Was Mr. Crooks acting alone?
[01:58:55.348 --> 01:58:58.651]  Again, I would have to refer you to the FBI's investigation.
[01:58:59.411 --> 01:59:00.752]  Was he just a lone gunman?
[01:59:02.914 --> 01:59:05.736]  I would have to refer you to the FBI's investigation for motive.
[01:59:07.257 --> 01:59:12.921]  We don't know about the water tower, but all the experts I talked to on and off air say shooter in the window right below him.
[01:59:13.221 --> 01:59:13.961]  Totally staged.
[01:59:14.802 --> 01:59:16.523]  I'll go to your calls, but first one more clip.
[01:59:16.543 --> 01:59:17.444]  I just can't help myself.
[01:59:18.565 --> 01:59:20.306]  This is Ketel.
[01:59:23.024 --> 01:59:25.767]  Saying that they did not think it was bad that he had a rangefinder.
[01:59:25.807 --> 01:59:26.168]  Here it is.
[01:59:28.010 --> 01:59:29.331]  Did he have a rangefinder?
[01:59:29.572 --> 01:59:33.136]  There were some reports that the individual had a rangefinder.
[01:59:33.196 --> 01:59:35.639]  That would certainly raise my suspicion.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.042]  Did he have a rangefinder?
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:48.046]  Yes he did, but may I explain that at a number of our sites, especially when you're at outdoor venues, a rangefinder is not a prohibited item.
[01:59:48.527 --> 01:59:52.230]  It is sometimes an item that is brought in by individuals who are going to be in the back.
[01:59:52.250 --> 01:59:53.631]  Did anybody confront him on that?
[01:59:54.611 --> 01:59:56.113]  Anybody ask him questions?
[01:59:56.133 --> 01:59:58.174]  What are you doing with a rangefinder?
[01:59:58.815 --> 02:00:04.339]  Anybody confront him on his presence, where he was in proximity to the President?
[02:00:05.089 --> 02:00:10.130]  So again, to my knowledge, I believe that that was the process that was taking place, was to locate the individual.
[02:00:10.330 --> 02:00:11.231]  Did they confront him?
[02:00:11.471 --> 02:00:12.631]  Did they go up to him?
[02:00:12.831 --> 02:00:14.352]  Did they talk to him?
[02:00:14.852 --> 02:00:16.492]  I do not have those details at this time.
[02:00:16.311 --> 02:00:23.311]  Those are important details.
[02:00:23.311 --> 02:00:25.811]  These people are our enemies.
[02:00:25.811 --> 02:00:35.811]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:00:27.015 --> 02:00:27.915]  Alright, thanks for holding.
[02:00:27.935 --> 02:00:30.636]  I'm going to try to get to everybody ahead of our special guest coming up.
[02:00:32.028 --> 02:00:37.109]  Robert J. O'Neill, one of the most famous military operatives in history.
[02:00:37.129 --> 02:00:39.790]  We're going to take these calls and see whether they're received.
[02:00:39.810 --> 02:00:42.491]  Let's talk to Steve in Arizona, then Brett in Oklahoma.
[02:00:42.851 --> 02:00:44.972]  Steve in Arizona, military on Trump shooting.
[02:00:44.992 --> 02:00:45.552]  Give us your view.
[02:00:47.232 --> 02:00:49.473]  Well, part of it's on Trump shooting.
[02:00:49.513 --> 02:00:51.114]  He's obviously, it was a setup.
[02:00:51.294 --> 02:00:56.735]  And then what I predict is this next following week is the Olympics.
[02:00:57.295 --> 02:00:59.396]  So we, I have no doubt.
[02:01:00.069 --> 02:01:09.812]  That the Globalists and the G20 and all of them have something staged for the Olympics.
[02:01:09.892 --> 02:01:10.513]  Give us your take.
[02:01:11.553 --> 02:01:17.635]  No, I agree that they want to change the story about one story with another, like Biden's stepping down.
[02:01:18.075 --> 02:01:20.516]  They are so desperate in their own documents to change the story.
[02:01:21.056 --> 02:01:22.036]  I didn't even think of the Olympics.
[02:01:22.056 --> 02:01:22.937]  What do you think is going to happen?
[02:01:22.977 --> 02:01:23.517]  What do you think, Ted?
[02:01:25.501 --> 02:01:49.145]  Well, all of it points towards that meeting that Trump had with Orban and the fact that they have sleepers in Europe right now waiting for these Olympic Games to distract, obviously, the public and to push us further into a conflict with Russia, even though we might know it's a militant group or an Islamic extremist.
[02:01:49.626 --> 02:01:51.806]  They're going to point all directions towards Putin.
[02:01:53.513 --> 02:01:57.475]  I agree with you that they've been trying to accelerate World War III as their distraction.
[02:01:58.616 --> 02:02:01.237]  They've moved long-range missiles and medium-range missiles into Europe.
[02:02:02.218 --> 02:02:03.139]  That's something we should be thinking about.
[02:02:03.159 --> 02:02:04.739]  We should all think about drone attacks on Trump.
[02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:11.583]  Not just poisoning, not just new shooters, not just truck bombs, but that as well.
[02:02:11.643 --> 02:02:12.124]  Anything else?
[02:02:13.084 --> 02:02:19.328]  Yeah, I just wanted to say a prayer for you because I have the anointing and I just wanted to pray for you and Trump on air if I could.
[02:02:19.488 --> 02:02:19.788]  Please.
[02:02:19.808 --> 02:02:21.649]  Alright.
[02:02:22.836 --> 02:02:25.178]  Lord, we just come to you today and we just give you thanks.
[02:02:25.638 --> 02:02:28.119]  We know that your spirit, Jesus, is on us.
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:32.362]  It's on Donald, it's on this country, and it's on Alex Jones.
[02:02:32.422 --> 02:02:43.109]  We just pray for your blessings, your anointing, and your hand to be upon us, to help us through this difficult time, and to point us towards your victory, Jesus.
[02:02:43.349 --> 02:02:45.210]  Your victory, Jesus of Nazareth.
[02:02:45.531 --> 02:02:46.551]  We say this in your name.
[02:02:47.052 --> 02:02:47.352]  Amen.
[02:02:48.973 --> 02:02:50.013]  I accept that prayer, brother.
[02:02:50.034 --> 02:02:50.614]  Thank you so much.
[02:02:54.494 --> 02:02:57.756]  I just don't think real listeners, a lot of you get it, but some don't.
[02:02:58.596 --> 02:02:59.757]  We're all in grave danger.
[02:03:01.597 --> 02:03:03.597]  Grave danger.
[02:03:03.597 --> 02:03:14.597]   If the general public was just more serious, they would understand this and realize our power.
[02:03:14.884 --> 02:03:19.836]   But a lot of people are somewhat awake, but they think cowering It's going to protect you.
[02:03:20.737 --> 02:03:27.379]  Zapata, and many people said this, but he's the most famous Mexican revolutionary said, it's better to die on your feet to live on your knees.
[02:03:28.059 --> 02:03:30.320]  But in my experience, you die on your knees.
[02:03:31.180 --> 02:03:32.261]  I'm going to live on my feet.
[02:03:32.561 --> 02:03:33.581]  Like that's an Alex Jones quote.
[02:03:35.042 --> 02:03:36.762]  I refuse to die on my knees.
[02:03:36.982 --> 02:03:40.383]  I'm going to live and fight and win on my feet.
[02:03:42.544 --> 02:03:44.225]  Everybody knows, where do you live?
[02:03:44.145 --> 02:03:56.805]   on your feet so I say to America on your feet you
[02:03:56.805 --> 02:04:01.805]  .
[02:04:00.352 --> 02:04:02.313]  We're already staring down the barrel of eternity.
[02:04:03.774 --> 02:04:05.035]  Why not be on God's side?
[02:04:06.415 --> 02:04:07.236]  That's the sure bet.
[02:04:09.197 --> 02:04:10.597]  Brett in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[02:04:10.737 --> 02:04:11.698]  Police on Trump.
[02:04:12.718 --> 02:04:13.599]  Tiffin assassination.
[02:04:13.619 --> 02:04:14.459]  Go ahead and give us your take.
[02:04:15.703 --> 02:04:18.425]  Yeah, I'm a 17-year cop and here's what I think.
[02:04:18.965 --> 02:04:28.392]  I can't believe that the first cop who ran into Thomas Crooks with a rangefinder didn't consider that enough probable cause to hold him right then and there.
[02:04:28.512 --> 02:04:34.737]  So, I'm asking myself, who did that cop talk to after he stopped Thomas Crooks?
[02:04:35.397 --> 02:04:35.797]  Exactly.
[02:04:35.817 --> 02:04:36.898]  Explain to people who don't know.
[02:04:36.938 --> 02:04:38.839]  He gets on the radio, he says, I gotta go to the rangefinder.
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:40.781]  Who was in charge saying let him go?
[02:04:42.008 --> 02:04:42.748]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:04:42.809 --> 02:04:48.632]  You know there's some sergeant or a chief of police or somebody in Secret Service that told him, hey, let him go.
[02:04:48.652 --> 02:04:49.493]  He's not a threat.
[02:04:50.073 --> 02:04:53.776]  So we need to find out what that timeline was, who he spoke to.
[02:04:54.216 --> 02:05:03.302]  I think it's very important that these people go on the record, whether it's videotaped depositions or sworn statements.
[02:05:04.025 --> 02:05:13.853]  They need to do this not only for posterity and for the investigation, because we know a cover-up is in place ongoing right now, but they need to do that for their own safety.
[02:05:14.453 --> 02:05:21.339]  Because if you read what happened after JFK was assassinated, Craig Roberts wrote a book called JFK the Dead Witnesses.
[02:05:21.977 --> 02:05:26.339]  All those people just started having car accidents and heart attacks and strokes.
[02:05:26.479 --> 02:05:26.899]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:05:26.939 --> 02:05:27.539]  So, that, exactly.
[02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:28.920]  Great book, both of them.
[02:05:28.940 --> 02:05:38.184]  So, and then there's another point I'd like to make, which is somebody needs to be out there investigating this.
[02:05:38.024 --> 02:05:44.743]   shot. So that exactly great book both of them. So and then there's another point I'd like to make
[02:05:44.743 --> 02:05:50.664]   which is somebody needs to be out there investigating this cover-up and investigation
[02:05:50.664 --> 02:05:55.304]   right now so that we know that the cover-up is taking place right now.
[02:05:55.304 --> 02:05:58.709]   So that's what I I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:05:58.849 --> 02:06:07.731]  I told Trump days ago, his people, right next to him, I said, you have got to do your own investigation.
[02:06:07.771 --> 02:06:09.252]  You've got to say this is obvious.
[02:06:09.672 --> 02:06:11.452]  That's a political issue right there.
[02:06:11.852 --> 02:06:13.673]  Instead, they're going to try to make this just go away.
[02:06:13.753 --> 02:06:14.973]  Trump's got to make the centerpiece.
[02:06:16.321 --> 02:06:17.081]  Exactly.
[02:06:17.882 --> 02:06:40.632]  And one way that you can do that is you get in touch with all the people that were first-hand witnesses, get their statements right now, and as this cover-up starts to take place, you then investigate it as a RICO-type case for the cover-up, for destroying evidence and a conspiracy, which it is.
[02:06:41.072 --> 02:06:41.552]  Gotta be.
[02:06:42.492 --> 02:06:43.913]  Nobody's this incompetent.
[02:06:44.543 --> 02:06:50.302]   And when people start facing prison terms, then you might have a chance of getting at the truth.
[02:06:50.302 --> 02:06:55.503]   But to think that we're going to get some sort of truth out of this current administration
[02:06:55.503 --> 02:06:59.264]   and what's happening right now, no, we're going to get a Warren report.
[02:06:59.264 --> 02:07:02.344]   We're going to get- And Mayorkas is right here. Here it is.
[02:07:02.344 --> 02:07:06.446]   Mayorkas appoints Trump-hater to independent- It's not rocket science.
[02:07:06.266 --> 02:07:08.146]  panel of Trump assassination.
[02:07:08.146 --> 02:07:09.846]  This is an ancient history.
[02:07:09.846 --> 02:07:13.406]   If they wanted to kill him because he's so popular, now he's more popular, what are they
[02:07:13.406 --> 02:07:14.406]  going to do?
[02:07:14.406 --> 02:07:16.066]  Try to kill him again.
[02:07:16.066 --> 02:07:17.066]  Exactly.
[02:07:17.066 --> 02:07:19.105]  It's not rocket science.
[02:07:19.105 --> 02:07:23.426]  Well, brother, what do you think we should do?
[02:07:23.426 --> 02:07:28.346]  Well, you know, it's be all of the above.
[02:07:28.356 --> 02:07:30.138]  You gotta get involved.
[02:07:30.258 --> 02:07:35.242]  You have to be engaged with your reps and your senators.
[02:07:35.282 --> 02:07:37.543]  You need to let them know that you're aware, you're awake.
[02:07:38.244 --> 02:07:39.885]  People need to support the InfoWar.
[02:07:39.905 --> 02:07:41.406]  They need to support you.
[02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:42.607]  And just a quick plug.
[02:07:43.108 --> 02:07:44.209]  Some of my favorite products.
[02:07:44.429 --> 02:07:45.650]  X2 is incredible.
[02:07:46.210 --> 02:07:47.651]  One drop a day in my coffee.
[02:07:47.671 --> 02:07:49.193]  I've been taking it about three weeks.
[02:07:49.773 --> 02:07:52.915]  And I swear my IQ has gone up by 10, 15 points.
[02:07:53.056 --> 02:07:54.076]  It's just incredible.
[02:07:54.377 --> 02:07:55.778]  RebelsN CBD.
[02:07:56.830 --> 02:07:58.912]  3,000 milligram, that stuff is amazing.
[02:07:58.972 --> 02:08:02.634]  I can sleep, I'm off some of my stuff that I was taking for sleep.
[02:08:03.435 --> 02:08:04.536]  Just incredible products.
[02:08:04.576 --> 02:08:06.277]  Don't sit on the fence anymore, folks.
[02:08:06.757 --> 02:08:09.920]  Get involved, get engaged, before it's too late.
[02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:11.681]  God bless you, Brett.
[02:08:13.102 --> 02:08:25.491]  But that's really what this comes down to, is we're living in the middle of history right now, and... I see the Republicans celebrating Trump's survival, and that's great, but man, they're about to hit us again.
[02:08:26.636 --> 02:08:29.918]  And we're going to wake up tomorrow and next week with a big false flag.
[02:08:31.139 --> 02:08:33.040]  And I'm not going to be like, yay!
[02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:34.161]  I'll wake up at 3 a.m.
[02:08:34.201 --> 02:08:34.781]  I got up at 3 a.m.
[02:08:34.821 --> 02:08:35.161]  this morning.
[02:08:35.182 --> 02:08:36.522]  I went to bed like 10 o'clock last night.
[02:08:36.983 --> 02:08:37.543]  I got up at 3 a.m.
[02:08:37.583 --> 02:08:38.384]  and been working since then.
[02:08:39.584 --> 02:08:41.085]  And I see everything I said coming true.
[02:08:41.105 --> 02:08:41.806]  I'm like, yay!
[02:08:41.866 --> 02:08:42.846]  No, I'm not like, yay!
[02:08:42.866 --> 02:08:44.067]  I want to stop it.
[02:08:44.267 --> 02:08:45.788]  I don't tell you this stuff to be proven right.
[02:08:47.309 --> 02:08:49.831]  I'm telling you where the enemy trajectory is going and we don't stop them.
[02:08:51.377 --> 02:08:52.998]  Alright, let's just rampage through these calls.
[02:08:53.018 --> 02:08:55.781]  We've got this big guest coming up, and I want to talk to all you amazing callers.
[02:08:56.401 --> 02:08:57.422]  Austin, Wisconsin.
[02:08:58.163 --> 02:09:00.565]  Firearms trainer, trained snipers in the military.
[02:09:00.585 --> 02:09:03.687]  What's your view on what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania?
[02:09:05.949 --> 02:09:07.090]  I'll tell you right now, Alex.
[02:09:07.470 --> 02:09:09.052]  There's a lot of problems.
[02:09:09.892 --> 02:09:24.486]   First off, you're telling me that a Republican-hating, 20-something-year-old wearing Republican-supporting companies Like Bunker Branding, who is a gun channel.
[02:09:25.127 --> 02:09:27.248]  That's a paradox, don't you think, Alex?
[02:09:28.889 --> 02:09:30.230]  Well, you can take one look at him.
[02:09:30.290 --> 02:09:31.471]  He's wandering around like a zombie.
[02:09:32.612 --> 02:09:33.092]  Exactly.
[02:09:33.672 --> 02:09:39.636]  And you're telling me that when we all heard those shots go off, they... Could you tell me who shot who?
[02:09:40.016 --> 02:09:42.058]  Which shots were fired from what rifle?
[02:09:42.578 --> 02:09:43.359]  Because I couldn't.
[02:09:43.399 --> 02:09:44.800]  They all sounded the exact same.
[02:09:44.820 --> 02:09:46.941]  And I've spent a lot of time on a range, Alex.
[02:09:47.421 --> 02:09:48.662]  I've worked with a lot of firearms.
[02:09:48.742 --> 02:09:49.863]  I've built my own firearms.
[02:09:50.818 --> 02:09:53.519]  And it's indistinguishable.
[02:09:53.579 --> 02:10:02.322]  The only one you can tell is different is the lazy sniper popping the 338 Lapua and telling you that the job's done there.
[02:10:02.342 --> 02:10:04.082]  He just takes him out like that.
[02:10:04.522 --> 02:10:05.743]  I don't believe it for a second.
[02:10:06.883 --> 02:10:18.987]  And you're telling me that a trained Secret Service sniper didn't notice a blonde 20-year-old sitting up on that building, setting up, getting ready to take those shots?
[02:10:20.089 --> 02:10:28.051]  Isn't rules of engagement, the moment that you see an assailant with a weapon, it's your duty to take them out.
[02:10:28.071 --> 02:10:30.072]  26 minutes, 26 minutes on the roof.
[02:10:30.432 --> 02:10:33.373]  The Secret Service admits that in testimony to Congress.
[02:10:34.773 --> 02:10:43.816]  Again, just like the last cop that called in, a few callers back, you question them all, but the Secret Service and the FBI is running the investigation.
[02:10:44.176 --> 02:10:48.497]  Mayorkas that did it, the Fox is running the investigation, so you can't do that.
[02:10:50.163 --> 02:10:53.685]  I don't trust any investigation that the government's running at this point.
[02:10:53.705 --> 02:11:06.211]  They do nothing for... You're telling me so that at a rally where our president was at had less security than three blocks away in Milwaukee where they're checking under cars for bombs?
[02:11:07.853 --> 02:11:13.597]  Well, and they also did, they're now reporting 10 times the security for Zelensky's visit last week.
[02:11:13.937 --> 02:11:14.557]  Thanks for the call.
[02:11:15.318 --> 02:11:21.822]  All right, up next, in the order they are received, let's talk to Brian in California, military on shooting.
[02:11:21.842 --> 02:11:22.442]  Give us your take.
[02:11:24.504 --> 02:11:25.805]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[02:11:25.825 --> 02:11:27.146]  Pleasure to be with you today.
[02:11:27.166 --> 02:11:33.370]  He asked me, I'm in a war zone here.
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:35.741]  We all are.
[02:11:36.182 --> 02:11:38.384]  I think America should admit, that's a great question, where am I?
[02:11:38.804 --> 02:11:39.565]  I'm in a new world.
[02:11:39.665 --> 02:11:41.888]  I was already hit with a bio-attack four years ago.
[02:11:42.288 --> 02:11:43.710]  Poisoned bio-attack shots.
[02:11:44.090 --> 02:11:45.111]  Totally open borders.
[02:11:45.652 --> 02:11:46.713]  Total world government.
[02:11:46.853 --> 02:11:47.934]  I am in a war zone, brother.
[02:11:47.954 --> 02:11:48.514]  That's where I am.
[02:11:49.676 --> 02:11:54.140]  So I want to thank you for firing info cannonballs at the Deep State 30 plus years.
[02:11:55.121 --> 02:11:56.563]  I think we all appreciate that.
[02:11:57.736 --> 02:12:01.158]  I have a couple points I want to make real quick so you can get another call on.
[02:12:02.559 --> 02:12:07.362]  So one thing that Cheadle hearing is just a setup for the Democrats to take a win.
[02:12:07.842 --> 02:12:08.702]  They're all on board.
[02:12:08.742 --> 02:12:10.944]  I think, you know, he's going to get fired.
[02:12:11.764 --> 02:12:16.527]  Another thing no one's really brought up is what Biden was going to do on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday.
[02:12:16.967 --> 02:12:20.349]  He was going to be in Austin in front of the LBJ's library.
[02:12:21.590 --> 02:12:28.595]  No one's really brought that up, but, you know, it seems like a strange backdrop for him to have on Monday after an assassination attempt.
[02:12:28.615 --> 02:12:33.559]  That'd have been perfect when LBJ killed Kennedy, and I interviewed E. Howard Hunt that ran the attack.
[02:12:33.599 --> 02:12:34.800]  It all came out documented.
[02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:36.461]  People don't think it's solved, folks.
[02:12:36.762 --> 02:12:37.622]  Deadbed confession.
[02:12:38.763 --> 02:12:39.263]  Exactly.
[02:12:39.584 --> 02:12:40.825]  So LBJ killed Kennedy.
[02:12:40.845 --> 02:12:42.626]  They were going to have a little celebration in Texas.
[02:12:43.987 --> 02:12:46.409]  And that's symbolism, you know, that Deep State operates.
[02:12:47.910 --> 02:12:53.051]   And then another point, you know, how does a guy With glasses on, looked through a scope.
[02:12:53.532 --> 02:12:55.353]  So I believe he was shot with his glasses on.
[02:12:56.934 --> 02:13:00.476]  And, uh, it's obvious that he was paraded in front of everyone.
[02:13:00.496 --> 02:13:02.437]  So it was just him, right?
[02:13:02.677 --> 02:13:13.203]  So they, I think they allowed all this parading of him being videoed here and this event or whatever, and then just blame it on the incompetence of the Secret Service, like they always do.
[02:13:13.744 --> 02:13:15.285]  But, you know, they paraded him around.
[02:13:15.305 --> 02:13:17.206]  That's another explanation for all that.
[02:13:18.061 --> 02:13:28.867]  Just to justify a single-shooter, which we know it's not.
[02:13:29.087 --> 02:13:35.010]  Oh, I also want to say about your products, I've been a long-time listener about as long as you've been on air.
[02:13:36.071 --> 02:13:43.495]  And it was 10 years ago, my wife, I watch every day, and my wife's like, why don't you buy his product?
[02:13:44.471 --> 02:13:45.532]  You watch all the time.
[02:13:45.592 --> 02:13:49.796]  You know, this isn't, you know, not entertainment, but information that you're getting from him.
[02:13:50.296 --> 02:13:52.118]  You're clearly supporting him.
[02:13:52.178 --> 02:13:53.859]  Why don't you support him financially?
[02:13:53.959 --> 02:13:58.403]  So I've been a product user and supporter for the last 10 years as well.
[02:13:58.724 --> 02:14:00.986]  Did you get value from the products?
[02:14:01.846 --> 02:14:02.267]  Oh, yeah.
[02:14:02.307 --> 02:14:03.868]  Your toothpaste is amazing.
[02:14:04.709 --> 02:14:05.970]  That's what I started with.
[02:14:06.310 --> 02:14:11.535]  And then, you know, I worked into, I pretty much bought everything else, but I'm a consistent toothpaste buyer.
[02:14:12.859 --> 02:14:20.383]  And I was so disappointed when the toothpaste went away due to whatever that thing was for a while, the Super Blue.
[02:14:20.623 --> 02:14:23.465]  Yeah, Latisa James, George Soros.
[02:14:24.245 --> 02:14:31.249]  And then I went to the charcoal, and I'm actually, you know, it's black, but I brush my teeth in the shower, and I love it.
[02:14:31.409 --> 02:14:36.271]  It soaks up everything on my gums, and so I buy them both now.
[02:14:36.331 --> 02:14:37.372]  I kind of trade off.
[02:14:38.052 --> 02:14:41.294]  Well, Ryan, thank you, because if you weren't supporting us, we wouldn't be here.
[02:14:42.344 --> 02:14:46.486]  Alright, we've got the big interview coming up on the shooting with a top military expert.
[02:14:47.226 --> 02:14:49.507]  But we want to jam a few more calls in here right now.
[02:14:49.527 --> 02:14:58.551]  We've got... Let's talk to Jason and PA real quick, and then to Sean, who is a caller who was at the Butler rally.
[02:14:58.571 --> 02:15:00.071]  Already had one Butler caller.
[02:15:00.131 --> 02:15:01.012]  Jason, what did you see?
[02:15:02.152 --> 02:15:02.832]  Hello, can you hear me?
[02:15:03.113 --> 02:15:03.673]  I can, go ahead.
[02:15:04.533 --> 02:15:04.953]  Cool, cool.
[02:15:04.973 --> 02:15:05.373]  How's it going?
[02:15:05.674 --> 02:15:05.834]  Good.
[02:15:05.894 --> 02:15:16.036]   So yeah, this was one of my first political rallies, and when I first got there, actually my cousin Used to be a sniper for the Secret Service.
[02:15:16.276 --> 02:15:20.018]  And so I was going around, I was looking, just wondering, hey, I wonder where they're posted at.
[02:15:20.499 --> 02:15:22.100]  And I assumed it would have been that building.
[02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:28.084]  And I noticed there was very little security over there, even about two or three hours beforehand.
[02:15:28.644 --> 02:15:39.752]  And when the shooting started, I knew instantly, I heard the three shots, and then the shots that came after, I assumed, were coming from multiple different Secret Services.
[02:15:40.487 --> 02:15:47.053]  It sounded very obviously on the ground like multiple shots from multiple weapons came after.
[02:15:47.613 --> 02:15:48.574]  I know what it's like.
[02:15:48.594 --> 02:15:50.696]  Well, that's what the shooter experts are telling me.
[02:15:50.776 --> 02:15:51.777]  Where were you at the rally?
[02:15:52.958 --> 02:16:03.567]  I was standing over more towards the right near where the media was set up in the middle and I was looking actually directly at the speaker that got hit when the first people behind him got shot.
[02:16:03.587 --> 02:16:05.429]  What was it like for you to see Trump get shot?
[02:16:07.150 --> 02:16:07.931]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[02:16:09.313 --> 02:16:10.734]  I ran pretty quickly.
[02:16:11.394 --> 02:16:17.497]  The chart was up there, and since there were so many people, the footage of him was not playing on the screen.
[02:16:18.277 --> 02:16:20.358]  So a lot of people in the back thought he was dead.
[02:16:21.058 --> 02:16:26.421]  And as I was running away and leaving, so many people were yelling, like, this is it.
[02:16:26.781 --> 02:16:27.541]  They really did it.
[02:16:27.641 --> 02:16:28.562]  Everybody get ready.
[02:16:29.362 --> 02:16:33.324]  Like, if it would have happened, like, trust me, I was on the ground.
[02:16:33.824 --> 02:16:36.525]  The vibe afterwards was very scary.
[02:16:36.805 --> 02:16:38.646]  Like, we didn't know what had happened.
[02:16:39.133 --> 02:16:41.857]  And everyone was like, oh my god, like, this is it.
[02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:44.441]  Incredible.
[02:16:44.541 --> 02:16:48.987]  You know, we have Robert J. O'Neill coming up.
[02:16:49.628 --> 02:16:51.811]  And we had Celente set to host the fourth hour.
[02:16:52.662 --> 02:16:56.144]  But I think I'm going to continue on with calls, because thank you, Jason.
[02:16:56.304 --> 02:16:56.705]  Don't hang up.
[02:16:56.725 --> 02:16:57.365]  I want to go back to you.
[02:16:57.966 --> 02:17:00.287]  We have Mark, a security officer, on the shooting.
[02:17:00.447 --> 02:17:02.108]  We have a security worker on the shooting.
[02:17:02.969 --> 02:17:05.150]  We have Multipass on the shooting.
[02:17:05.971 --> 02:17:06.451]  You know what?
[02:17:06.571 --> 02:17:07.632]  I've got this guest coming up.
[02:17:07.652 --> 02:17:08.252]  We've got to do it.
[02:17:08.292 --> 02:17:11.614]  Get the names and numbers of these folks, and I will go back to them tomorrow.
[02:17:11.634 --> 02:17:12.515]  I will call them back.
[02:17:13.035 --> 02:17:17.218]  But I need to go ahead and air the Robert J. O'Neill interview coming up here in a few minutes.
[02:17:17.698 --> 02:17:18.439]  Anything else, Jason?
[02:17:20.220 --> 02:17:20.961]  Not really, I guess.
[02:17:22.051 --> 02:17:23.332]  Oh actually, well actually, one other thing.
[02:17:23.352 --> 02:17:24.793]  I don't know if you've touched on this yet.
[02:17:25.113 --> 02:17:33.820]  I'm not sure what to make of this, but have you seen the interesting video, I don't know what to make of it, of the UFOs appearing above Trump literally seconds before?
[02:17:34.021 --> 02:17:40.746]  I know that's a wild one, but the video was, I have to admit, I've seen two of them now, and kind of compelling.
[02:17:40.786 --> 02:17:42.787]  Well UFO just means unidentified flying object.
[02:17:42.827 --> 02:17:44.409]  No, I haven't seen those and I appreciate your call.
[02:17:45.149 --> 02:17:46.751]  But I mean, who knows what was going on.
[02:17:48.052 --> 02:17:48.352]  Alright.
[02:17:49.437 --> 02:17:53.083]  We're gonna go to break, come back with our special interview with Robert J O'Neill.
[02:17:55.717 --> 02:17:58.179]  Show Team Six on his view of the situation.
[02:17:58.199 --> 02:18:00.840]  Then Gerald Cilente for the third hour.
[02:18:00.900 --> 02:18:02.722]  Then Owen Schroer, The War Room.
[02:18:03.162 --> 02:18:04.183]  And we're on X. That's great.
[02:18:04.203 --> 02:18:04.903]  We're not being censored.
[02:18:04.923 --> 02:18:05.343]  It's wonderful.
[02:18:05.403 --> 02:18:06.004]  Ralph Alex Jones.
[02:18:06.324 --> 02:18:10.627]  You can always find us at InfoWars.com forward slash show or until they shut us down.
[02:18:10.647 --> 02:18:12.248]  And you'll find me wherever I'm at.
[02:18:12.488 --> 02:18:13.269]  Find me where I go.
[02:18:13.789 --> 02:18:14.890]  We're so close to being shut down.
[02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:16.431]  It's like I could kill Trump tomorrow.
[02:18:16.451 --> 02:18:17.231]  I could kill me tomorrow.
[02:18:17.632 --> 02:18:18.732]  But you've got the information.
[02:18:18.752 --> 02:18:19.453]  You've got the shows.
[02:18:19.473 --> 02:18:20.353]  You've got the archives.
[02:18:20.474 --> 02:18:24.316]  Please save everything because what we say today is not just evergreen.
[02:18:24.356 --> 02:18:25.137]  It's ultra green.

[02:18:41.322 --> 02:18:42.142]  Great job, crew.
[02:18:42.642 --> 02:18:43.682]  Want to thank you all.
[02:18:44.002 --> 02:18:45.483]  We'll be right back with our special guest.
[02:18:45.503 --> 02:18:45.923]  Stay with us.
[02:18:47.281 --> 02:18:59.008]  Whether it's the World Economic Forum, whether it's the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, whether it's Open Philanthropy and Dustin Moskowitz, we know that all of these organizations thought that they could bamboozle all of us.
[02:18:59.429 --> 02:19:04.172]  They thought that by putting fact checkers on every post, we'd stop sharing posts.
[02:19:04.632 --> 02:19:08.555]  They thought by cancelling people, that we wouldn't actually listen to people's voices.
[02:19:08.655 --> 02:19:12.117]   But the bad news is for them, We continue to do it.
[02:19:12.497 --> 02:19:14.318]  So what are the simple things that you can do?
[02:19:14.679 --> 02:19:20.723]  The simple things you can do, like I said before, support the alternative platforms that are allowing these voices to be heard.
[02:19:21.023 --> 02:19:23.504]  Make sure that you actually have these conversations.
[02:19:23.645 --> 02:19:28.408]  Without the utility of this voice and this platform, we will lose the war.
[02:19:28.908 --> 02:19:30.309]  So our job is really simple.
[02:19:30.729 --> 02:19:31.269]  Share this.
[02:19:31.329 --> 02:19:32.090]  Communicate this.
[02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:33.931]  Support the InfoWar.
[02:19:34.311 --> 02:19:39.814]  Go to InfoWarStore.com for products to keep strong and prepared.
[02:19:39.913 --> 02:20:06.452]   donate and share the videos at band.video well we've had a lot of really interesting and amazing
[02:20:06.452 --> 02:20:11.272]   soldiers and Marines and seals on and then pilots over the years but I
[02:20:11.272 --> 02:20:17.272]   got to tell you Robert J O'Neill is got to be the most famous
[02:20:15.992 --> 02:20:18.093]  He's the number one New York Times best-selling author.
[02:20:19.490 --> 02:20:25.235]  The memoir of the operator firing the shots that killed Osama bin Laden in his years as a SEAL team warrior.
[02:20:25.295 --> 02:20:34.182]  If I try to read his bio and all of his top commendations, it would take up the 26 minutes we have because he's got to leave here in a few minutes to get on an airplane.
[02:20:34.923 --> 02:21:00.962]   But I got his contact through some friends of mine and reached out to him because I wanted to get his take on what happened now eight, nine days ago in Butler, Pennsylvania, and also get the sense of his community Who are the world-leading experts on sniping and counter sniping and the rest of it of what the consensus is and of course we've had some other well-known snipers and experts on as well and we've gotten their takes on this.
[02:21:01.003 --> 02:21:03.264]  So I wanted to get Robert J O'Neill's take on it.
[02:21:03.804 --> 02:21:06.265]  You can find him at Robert J O'Neill dot com.
[02:21:06.305 --> 02:21:13.701]   You can also find him on X at MC Hurrah or H O O Y A-H.
[02:21:14.062 --> 02:21:15.865]  So, Robert, thank you so much for taking time out.
[02:21:15.885 --> 02:21:22.218]  I'm going to try to just give you the floor here to give us the data dump and kind of, if you can, repeat some of the things that you told me yesterday.
[02:21:23.553 --> 02:21:24.953]  Well, first of all, thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:21:25.013 --> 02:21:25.973]  It's great to be here.
[02:21:26.734 --> 02:21:34.835]  Yeah, I've been talking with other snipers, SEAL snipers, Green Berets, Army snipers, Marines, and we're all trying to do the same thing.
[02:21:34.855 --> 02:21:38.256]  We're all trying to find out what, was it incompetence or was someone involved?
[02:21:38.716 --> 02:21:42.036]  And we don't, I mean, we don't want it to be anything, but obviously something bad happened.
[02:21:42.076 --> 02:21:43.377]  I mean, the first thing is incompetence.
[02:21:44.437 --> 02:21:50.878]  They said that the slope roof was only 150 yards, if that away was out of their perimeter, which is nonsense.
[02:21:51.440 --> 02:22:19.897]   Because uh you know my first time my first work as a sniper was in 1998 protecting the president of Albania in Albania and we had a minimum perimeter of a thousand meters when we were using 400 meter holes on our mill dots so 150 yards is uh is that's a layup that's point blank even for the worst shooter I could take someone that's never picked up a weapon with an ar-15 and have him hit in the middle at 100 yards within five minutes And then just the way that he was allowed this kid,
[02:22:19.897 --> 02:22:25.256]   this 20 year old kid to get in there with a weapon, and people saw him for a long time.
[02:22:25.256 --> 02:22:26.697]  They were yelling at law enforcement.
[02:22:26.697 --> 02:22:29.897]  There's a kid up there, there's a gun, he's a shooter.
[02:22:29.897 --> 02:22:30.736]  How did he get there?
[02:22:30.736 --> 02:22:34.337]   They're saying, well, he might've stashed a gun in the AC unit.
[02:22:34.337 --> 02:22:38.777]   And even looking at the overlays, the sniper, I didn't see a lot of AC units in the building
[02:22:38.777 --> 02:22:40.857]  where there was a tactical team station.
[02:22:40.857 --> 02:22:42.256]  So how's he getting up there?
[02:22:42.099 --> 02:22:43.720]  Who's dropping the ball on this whole thing?
[02:22:43.741 --> 02:23:01.131]   You know, that's the first part and then and then It's just for them to say you can't it's such an easy shot to take they um, I don't know so I'm one not as far as a confidence, but is a Is are people actually doing the most that they can for
[02:23:01.131 --> 02:23:01.612]  this president?
[02:23:01.612 --> 02:23:04.572]   Do they just not like him and then they don't sorry but don't have something off here
[02:23:04.572 --> 02:23:10.121]   It's just that there's so much there. Uh inside job Not so much. I hope a lot of people are saying that former
[02:23:10.121 --> 02:23:17.021]   secret service agent whom i've spoken. But um Yeah, so much stuff is is wrong there that uh, I can't I
[02:23:17.021 --> 02:23:23.311]   can't quite put my finger on it per se but um, It's shady at shady at best. What about him being able to
[02:23:23.311 --> 02:23:24.012]  fly a drone?
[02:23:24.012 --> 02:23:30.581]   hours before over that site Uh, what about the the woman in with the secret service in
[02:23:30.581 --> 02:23:34.092]  his direct bubble who can't holster the gun?
[02:23:34.092 --> 02:23:38.031]   And then there's video of her minutes later. She still is trying to do it
[02:23:37.947 --> 02:23:40.149]  I mean, this is just beyond bizarre.
[02:23:42.050 --> 02:23:45.352]  Yeah, I mean, I've never had a problem with people putting a gun back in a holster.
[02:23:45.372 --> 02:23:52.216]  Obviously, adrenaline's going, but they're also saying that this might not have been the premier team, like they were somewhere else and they picked up some desk people or whatever.
[02:23:52.476 --> 02:23:53.957]  There was definitely some confusion.
[02:23:54.197 --> 02:24:05.439]   I do want to give credit to the people who ran To the sounds of the guns, because they're shooting at President Trump right there for sure, and there are bullets flying, and a bullet doesn't really care who you are, and it only needs to be right one time.
[02:24:05.719 --> 02:24:13.224]  But on the way out, they didn't get him off the X very quickly, they didn't... I mean, even as far as... You get in trouble for telling the truth, and actually, you of all people know that.
[02:24:13.744 --> 02:24:20.552]  The truth of the matter here, as far as DEI is, if the President, I don't care if he's wearing lips or not, is 6'4", then everyone around him needs to be 6'4".
[02:24:20.592 --> 02:24:22.774]  If you're shorter, it's just, you can't help it, you just are.
[02:24:23.015 --> 02:24:24.056]  You need to protect the principle.
[02:24:24.637 --> 02:24:28.201]  They didn't seem like they knew what they were doing, and they weren't even sure which sniper took the shot.
[02:24:28.701 --> 02:24:34.687]  I did talk to a Marine sniper friend of mine who said he was looking at the tripod of one of the snipers up top and it looked like it was too high.
[02:24:35.047 --> 02:24:36.949]  When he fired, it moved the wrong way.
[02:24:37.029 --> 02:24:41.913]  So, the way that I would put it is they were taking complacency over comfort, maybe?
[02:24:42.734 --> 02:24:44.816]  They wanted to be more comfortable so they would let a couple things go.
[02:24:45.375 --> 02:24:49.294]   uh... and and and again just what does what having a tactical team down to the
[02:24:49.294 --> 02:24:52.895]   guy that climbed the roof they said that again we don't even know how much of
[02:24:52.895 --> 02:24:57.095]   this is true they said after reports of a sniper being up on the roof
[02:24:57.095 --> 02:25:01.255]   one of the law enforcement guys climbed up the roof and had a gun pointed at him
[02:25:01.255 --> 02:25:11.295]   so they turn around the left that's not what you do First of all, if you hear there's a shooter on a roof, as a tactical guy, if it's your primary or your secondary, you pull out your pistol, you climb the ladder.
[02:25:11.675 --> 02:25:15.420]  If there's a threat, if you're potentially going to be engaged, you engage first or reengage.
[02:25:15.460 --> 02:25:17.082]  You certainly don't run away for a number of reasons.
[02:25:17.222 --> 02:25:19.244]  One, the former president is on the stage.
[02:25:19.264 --> 02:25:20.606]  You don't want him to get shot.
[02:25:20.666 --> 02:25:25.089]   And two, I personally don't want to leave Someone on the high ground will run away when they're gonna have a shot at me.
[02:25:25.109 --> 02:25:27.190]  It's like chasing someone with a gun through a forest.
[02:25:27.210 --> 02:25:28.491]  They might just stop, turn around and get you.
[02:25:28.751 --> 02:25:34.533]  If this guy sees you, decides the gig is up, then he's gonna go to the edge and he's gonna start taking shots down at you running away.
[02:25:34.573 --> 02:25:36.294]  So that's hard to buy.
[02:25:36.354 --> 02:25:38.155]  And then another team that took a shot and missed...
[02:25:38.875 --> 02:25:41.516]  Um, there's so much, there's so much shady stuff going on there.
[02:25:41.537 --> 02:25:52.542]  And then, I mean, that's just like, the first thing you do as a sniper, the first thing that I did on my very first job as like a 21-year-old sniper, is you go to where the principal is going to be, and then you look around 360, what are the threats?
[02:25:52.582 --> 02:25:54.243]  That first slope roof is a major threat.
[02:25:54.283 --> 02:25:55.644]  The water tower is a major threat.
[02:25:56.084 --> 02:25:58.245]  At the very least, you put someone up there.
[02:25:58.905 --> 02:26:04.703]   And even if a tactical team is inside said building with the slope roof, Stasia sent someone up there.
[02:26:04.723 --> 02:26:14.530]  A slanted roof is a blatant excuse by the powers that be, by the Director of the Secret Service, who should no longer have a... And by the way, what's that grade look like, Robert?
[02:26:14.570 --> 02:26:16.031]  Like 5% or something?
[02:26:16.171 --> 02:26:17.873]  I mean, it's a joke.
[02:26:18.913 --> 02:26:21.955]  There were videos going online of cows on roofs like that on barns.
[02:26:21.976 --> 02:26:22.896]  It's ridiculous.
[02:26:23.136 --> 02:26:24.137]  It's an excuse.
[02:26:26.118 --> 02:26:33.042]  That a lot of Democrats use, assuming most of the people aren't paying attention, they'll just take their word for it and get on with it.
[02:26:33.522 --> 02:26:34.203]  That's what it's gotta be.
[02:26:34.503 --> 02:26:46.690]  But like I said, every tactical guy with whom I've spoken, one of the most recent snipers is my nephew, Keegan, who graduated Army Sniper School a couple years ago, and he was saying the exact same stuff that I was saying in my 17 years as a SEAL sniper.
[02:26:47.110 --> 02:26:55.581]   And again, these guys, me, the snipers, we're not Democrats and Republicans, we're Americans trying to get to the bottom of this.
[02:26:55.961 --> 02:27:01.566]  And I'm wrestling with inside job plan, they weren't doing enough, or just incompetence.
[02:27:01.666 --> 02:27:04.108]  The incompetence bothers me, because everyone should be fired there.
[02:27:04.128 --> 02:27:08.412]  And then that begs the question, who was hired for certain positions and why?
[02:27:08.632 --> 02:27:12.436]  I mean, is it as far as the Secret Service didn't have their A-team there?
[02:27:12.636 --> 02:27:14.278]  Or that team didn't brief up the local cops?
[02:27:15.118 --> 02:27:20.943]  I mean, if I'm a local cop not used to doing presidential details, I might catch myself slipping just listening to the president.
[02:27:20.983 --> 02:27:23.385]  Doesn't matter which one talked because it's kind of cool to be here.
[02:27:23.825 --> 02:27:26.047]  But this ball was majorly, and I don't think anyone's been fired yet.
[02:27:26.067 --> 02:27:30.090]  I mean, we lost a great patriot there who, you know, I'm a father of daughters.
[02:27:30.130 --> 02:27:31.891]  He jumped on his daughters and took a bullet to the head.
[02:27:32.131 --> 02:27:39.037]  He was there to see the president and make friends, and he died for this cause because of whatever reason it was that shooter got up there.
[02:27:39.377 --> 02:27:41.899]  Then we got to get into, was there another shooter as well?
[02:27:43.257 --> 02:27:48.681]  Speak to that, because I've talked on-air and off-air to a lot of other well-known, respected top snipers.
[02:27:48.701 --> 02:28:07.824]   In fact, one of the guys has the longest shot on record, and he said that as soon as he saw The images instantly because he was watching it live and as soon as he saw nobody on the water tower, nobody on the roof, 450 feet away, he said that it was just blatant.
[02:28:07.844 --> 02:28:15.952]  It was like a joke that that's the place you've got your people, that's the high ground, that's where they can surveil everything, and that's where shooters would try to go.
[02:28:17.512 --> 02:28:29.960]  Well yeah, maybe on the tower, but if you've got a professional sniper, I'd be looking, I haven't been to the site yet, I've seen the imagery we've all seen, but I'd be looking for alleyways out to maybe 600 meters.
[02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:33.282]  Where can someone drive up at the right time, take a shot and drive away?
[02:28:33.542 --> 02:28:34.703]  And that's what a professional would do.
[02:28:35.703 --> 02:28:37.584]  And again, I hope that didn't happen.
[02:28:37.704 --> 02:28:39.084]  I don't want it to have happened.
[02:28:39.444 --> 02:28:41.485]  The water tower, there's really no out.
[02:28:41.925 --> 02:28:44.026]  You need to have someone helping you get off of there.
[02:28:44.086 --> 02:28:45.506]  And people will see that, I hope.
[02:28:45.826 --> 02:28:46.866]  I mean, they saw the kid on the roof.
[02:28:47.247 --> 02:28:50.107]  But why were there eight shots taken?
[02:28:50.488 --> 02:28:51.968]  Why was the crowd hit three times?
[02:28:52.128 --> 02:28:55.349]  Two people critically wounded and then a fatality.
[02:28:56.144 --> 02:29:02.046]  Who gets eight shots off when there should be snipers looking at a place where they said that the locals are saying there's somebody up there?
[02:29:03.107 --> 02:29:06.428]  The people that had like five bears in them with a cell phone are saying, look, there's a guy up there.
[02:29:06.828 --> 02:29:08.669]  So I'm wondering if there is another spot.
[02:29:08.709 --> 02:29:09.789]  I'd love to look and see.
[02:29:09.870 --> 02:29:11.470]  Like I said, I'm only speculating.
[02:29:11.830 --> 02:29:15.892]  But the eight shots getting taken and then there's the acoustics that some engineers have been listening to.
[02:29:16.658 --> 02:29:21.440]  From the microphone, from where President Trump was speaking, they're just saying they're not quite the same.
[02:29:22.121 --> 02:29:29.184]  Would that be a shot from another potential assassin, or from the tactical team that missed, or was another shot taken?
[02:29:29.224 --> 02:29:30.505]  Again, I wish I was an expert in that.
[02:29:30.945 --> 02:29:34.426]  I'm only looking at it from, you know, 30,000 feet here, but... Well, I'll say this.
[02:29:35.227 --> 02:29:41.930]  I mean, and I'm not, because I don't know all the Coriolis and wind, I'm not good at all that stuff, but I've grown up in Texas shooting shotguns when I was four years old.
[02:29:42.530 --> 02:29:44.831]  I've, and this is on camera, I've maybe shot video of it.
[02:29:46.747 --> 02:29:51.690]  Two or three shots, I can hone in and shoot a coke can at 700 yards and you see it explode.
[02:29:51.970 --> 02:29:54.411]  And I've shot mountain goats at 800 yards, a thousand yards.
[02:29:54.951 --> 02:29:57.993]  So I just can't understand how that you'll eat.
[02:29:58.213 --> 02:30:01.035]  I mean, reportedly this guy did a lot of marksman practicing and all this.
[02:30:01.435 --> 02:30:02.275]  It's a blessing.
[02:30:02.335 --> 02:30:05.377]  I mean, I think the hand of God was there that Trump was not killed.
[02:30:06.886 --> 02:30:07.907]  Oh, something was there.
[02:30:07.927 --> 02:30:13.751]  I mean, him turning his head, if that's the hand of God, which, you know, it probably was, him turning his head saved his life.
[02:30:15.333 --> 02:30:23.979]  But also, I mean, if that's what says it's probably just the one shooter, is a professional sniper is not going to give him that much time.
[02:30:24.019 --> 02:30:30.364]  It should be center mass, and I don't want to really get into where you aim, but it's not necessarily the sight, but that was the angle he had.
[02:30:32.100 --> 02:30:35.002]  But I mean, is it all top coverage?
[02:30:35.022 --> 02:30:39.924]  You know that kid was in a Black Rock commercial and maybe they don't like Trump and they scrub his social media.
[02:30:40.144 --> 02:30:43.206]  And they're like, what was that excuse they couldn't get into his phone?
[02:30:43.526 --> 02:30:44.886]  It's like, well, the kid's right there.
[02:30:45.107 --> 02:30:47.108]  Why don't you use his fingerprints to get into his phone?
[02:30:47.488 --> 02:30:48.368]  And then they scrub it.
[02:30:48.408 --> 02:30:49.269]  We don't know what he said.
[02:30:51.034 --> 02:31:02.878]  Is it, is it, you know, like I said at the beginning, maybe they're just not quite doing as much as they should because they don't really care if it's Trump, but it's just, this is really shady and unlike, you know, in Dallas when President Kennedy was killed, there's a lot of phones everywhere, more people are watching.
[02:31:04.179 --> 02:31:10.801]  It's, like everyone I said, no one says, yeah, clean break, one shooter, game over, which is what they wanted, whoever they is.
[02:31:10.921 --> 02:31:15.943]  But it's, there's a lot of top cover, a lot of, seems to me like a lot of cover up, and I don't like saying that.
[02:31:16.123 --> 02:31:23.183]   I like, I would much rather it just be factual and simple, but You know better than anyone else it's not always the case.
[02:31:23.183 --> 02:31:27.664]   Well, pulling back from this, Jack was obviously a great source. He talked directly to
[02:31:27.664 --> 02:31:31.344]  federal agents that are in the investigation on the ground.
[02:31:31.344 --> 02:31:38.943]   They said they found not totally professional but way above amateur explosives in the car
[02:31:38.943 --> 02:31:42.463]   and at his house that they believe he had to have help making.
[02:31:42.463 --> 02:31:47.904]   Then he had these foreign digital accounts and all sorts of other things.
[02:31:47.904 --> 02:31:51.343]   He flew a drone over two hours before but then you see the video of him
[02:31:51.343 --> 02:31:53.983]  wandering around like a lost puppy.
[02:31:54.108 --> 02:32:26.839]   Beneath where he reportedly later got up on the roof and shot and I've been to quite a few presidential events going back 30 years being on air and even when the Secret Service knows you and you're in an area they still check your badge when you go in to see Trump you know they still say let me see your cell phone stuff like that make sure it's not a gun hey Alex we know you're not a bad guy but we're still gonna have to check you and and so if I get checked and everybody knows who I am who is this guy just wandering around I don't get it Yeah, flying the drone too when the Secret Service has zero and those are the cheapest ways to get overhead imagery.
[02:32:27.280 --> 02:32:28.120]  So he's doing that first.
[02:32:28.160 --> 02:32:29.101]  That's a red flag.
[02:32:29.481 --> 02:32:30.882]  He had a golf range finder.
[02:32:31.202 --> 02:32:32.103]  That should be another flag.
[02:32:32.383 --> 02:32:34.965]  And just wandering around the way that he was.
[02:32:35.365 --> 02:32:39.288]  I've heard that some of the gates were just zip-tied shut, which is obviously very easy to cut.
[02:32:39.328 --> 02:32:40.609]  They didn't talk to any of the neighbors.
[02:32:41.649 --> 02:32:45.010]  It just seemed, again, incompetence or just lackadaisical.
[02:32:45.211 --> 02:32:47.051]  Yeah, the drone thing is incredible.
[02:32:47.671 --> 02:32:51.193]  Even though they're everywhere, why are you allowed to fly a drone there?
[02:32:51.213 --> 02:33:02.657]  I mean, when all this adds up, even before the President gets there, the lead detail, or even a dude on the detail, one of the women on the detail, says, hey, we gotta hold fast for about 10, 20 minutes before we get to the bottom of all this.
[02:33:02.677 --> 02:33:03.658]  And then you can re-clear it.
[02:33:03.678 --> 02:33:06.319]  I mean, it's not hard to re-clear, especially with countersnipers.
[02:33:06.339 --> 02:33:07.319]  They can get glass on everything.
[02:33:08.348 --> 02:33:12.692]  Countersnipers are snipers who have been through the schools and the training where you can spot other snipers.
[02:33:12.712 --> 02:33:13.272]  That's their whole job.
[02:33:13.312 --> 02:33:14.193]  That's why it's a countersniper.
[02:33:15.915 --> 02:33:25.323]  I'd love to know who is in charge of not just the sniping detail, but also the entire detail and what he or she says because we're really not getting a lot of answers.
[02:33:25.363 --> 02:33:25.783]  Am I wrong?
[02:33:26.924 --> 02:33:27.605]  You're absolutely right.
[02:33:27.645 --> 02:33:42.791]   Well, the consensus I've gotten is it goes from criminal, basically deliberate negligence by Mayorkas and this director under him, Of the Secret Service refusing Trump even one-tenth of what he needs, treating him like he's just a former president.
[02:33:43.652 --> 02:33:48.555]  We know Robert Kennedy Jr., they won't give him one Secret Service agent.
[02:33:48.615 --> 02:33:55.379]  So, by default, you do this, you're going to open the door, but then you add in, where are the press conferences?
[02:33:55.700 --> 02:34:04.666]  Like you normally would have with any big crime or big event, you would have press conferences that day, the next day, you would have updates, we'd see images of the gun.
[02:34:05.186 --> 02:34:12.549]  We'd be hearing about it, but instead there's this eerie silence that Senator Josh Hawley tries to go there, even though he has local authorization.
[02:34:12.929 --> 02:34:14.749]  FBI kicks a senator out.
[02:34:15.049 --> 02:34:16.470]  He should lead a delegation there.
[02:34:16.990 --> 02:34:19.891]  They've been keeping everybody away from the water tower, away from the building.
[02:34:20.451 --> 02:34:21.432]  What do you think's going on there?
[02:34:22.612 --> 02:34:31.555]  Yeah, I don't know, because they're saying it's still an FBI investigation, but some people that I've heard speak have said that it's just like one security guy running around chasing people off.
[02:34:32.376 --> 02:34:35.179]  And, yeah, they kicked a senator out of there who's looking into it.
[02:34:35.199 --> 02:34:36.420]  They don't want an investigation.
[02:34:37.381 --> 02:34:41.084]  Because, I mean, if you're telling the truth, you really don't need to remember a line.
[02:34:41.104 --> 02:34:41.905]  You have nothing to hide.
[02:34:41.945 --> 02:34:43.947]  But it does seem like they're covering everything up.
[02:34:44.007 --> 02:34:53.116]  And, I mean, even now with President Biden saying he's not running again, what kind of backdoor deals are being made all over the place?
[02:34:53.816 --> 02:34:56.259]  I think they're trying to get our eyes off the prize with this one.
[02:34:57.408 --> 02:34:59.512]  Um, it just doesn't seem right.
[02:34:59.912 --> 02:35:05.381]  You would think if a former president has an assassination attempt and gets shot in the head, that there'd be more to it than this.
[02:35:05.421 --> 02:35:08.346]  But it's almost like, again, you catch them doing something and they just walk away.
[02:35:08.566 --> 02:35:11.931]  I mean, how often are we seeing now everyone from the director of the Secret Service to...
[02:35:12.912 --> 02:35:23.217]  Members of Congress getting asked legit questions by a media who is supposed to, you know, keep them in line but never does, and they just walk away and pretend they're on their phone, or they get into the congressional elevator, or they just don't say anything.
[02:35:23.477 --> 02:35:24.978]  What kind of a banana republic is this?
[02:35:24.998 --> 02:35:33.562]  I mean, we're seeing a lot of weird, weird stuff go on, and it's like, it's almost like every day there's a new headline to help you forget about the last one.
[02:35:34.342 --> 02:35:37.784]  It's almost like they're about to get caught, so they're trying everything they got.
[02:35:39.346 --> 02:35:40.926]  Robert O'Neill, you just read my mind.
[02:35:40.986 --> 02:35:42.147]  That was my next question.
[02:35:43.327 --> 02:35:48.409]  And I was already thinking this a few days ago, but there was even an article I saw on Drudge saying, did Trump peak too early?
[02:35:48.429 --> 02:35:51.970]  And they basically say, well, people don't have an attention span.
[02:35:51.990 --> 02:35:53.150]  They'll forget this happened.
[02:35:53.170 --> 02:36:02.112]  And remember the first day for like eight hours, even Forbes and Reuters were calling it an incident and the president fell and there was some pop, pop, pop.
[02:36:02.412 --> 02:36:04.693]  And so there was a real attempt to play this down.
[02:36:04.753 --> 02:36:07.894]  Then by midnight, they had to say, okay, it was an assassination attempt.
[02:36:08.294 --> 02:36:11.576]  But they tried to play that down and now they're openly hoping people forget about this.
[02:36:11.976 --> 02:36:13.597]  I don't think folks are going to forget about this.
[02:36:13.637 --> 02:36:16.898]  This is a historic event, not just here, but around the world.
[02:36:17.258 --> 02:36:20.660]  Trump's approval rating has exploded here and around the world.
[02:36:20.680 --> 02:36:22.541]  He's popular in Europe.
[02:36:22.561 --> 02:36:24.062]  He's popular in China and Russia.
[02:36:24.082 --> 02:36:25.662]  I mean, that's in the news.
[02:36:25.682 --> 02:36:28.984]  So people saw this and popping back up fight, fight, fight.
[02:36:30.194 --> 02:36:33.039]  What do you think President Trump should do?
[02:36:33.079 --> 02:36:34.221]  I know he's talking to Eric Prince.
[02:36:34.561 --> 02:36:40.231]  I know they've got some of the guys that are retired out of special operations, you know, forming up into a group.
[02:36:40.311 --> 02:36:41.252]  I think that's really smart.
[02:36:41.533 --> 02:36:44.598]  What have you heard about that and what is your advice to President Trump?
[02:36:45.999 --> 02:36:50.724]  Well, I mean, I, again, being patriotic, would hope he could trust the Secret Service.
[02:36:50.784 --> 02:36:51.404]  I wouldn't mind.
[02:36:51.464 --> 02:36:54.787]  I mean, at this point, yeah, I think you want to hire people out there.
[02:36:55.488 --> 02:37:01.734]  I know guys that I worked at SEAL Team 6 with for a long time that have security companies that are more than willing to go and do this, obviously, which would be good for him.
[02:37:01.774 --> 02:37:02.595]  I think it's a good move.
[02:37:03.235 --> 02:37:04.577]  I love the fight-fight thing.
[02:37:04.617 --> 02:37:09.061]  I mean, I said the President needs to get off the X as quickly as he could, but he took complete advantage of that moment.
[02:37:10.001 --> 02:37:11.262]  I've never been shot in the head.
[02:37:11.302 --> 02:37:15.764]  I've been shot at, but I can imagine how it can throw you out of sorts, but he knew to do that at the time.
[02:37:15.844 --> 02:37:18.645]  And he wasn't saying, he was saying fight for all of us.
[02:37:18.665 --> 02:37:24.948]  He wasn't, you know, it's just, it was a, it was a very good moment, but he, you know, he, he, I think his demeanor has changed quite a bit and that's great.
[02:37:24.968 --> 02:37:26.189]  And he's trying to be more unifying.
[02:37:26.229 --> 02:37:31.572]  I think the message though, that he needs to put out here is with the assassination attempt with Joe Biden going away.
[02:37:32.172 --> 02:37:42.431]   And I mean, he's going to go to the convention and now we're talking super delegates to like, When they say a threat to democracy, you've got elites in the Democratic Party picking their candidate every single time.
[02:37:42.831 --> 02:37:45.794]  How many millions of Americans voted for Biden to be the nominee?
[02:37:45.974 --> 02:37:46.655]  Well, they're pulling him out.
[02:37:46.835 --> 02:37:47.495]  Who are they putting in?
[02:37:47.516 --> 02:37:48.777]  We won't know until the convention.
[02:37:48.977 --> 02:37:52.260]  They did it in 2020, they did it in 2016, so they get their guy there.
[02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:56.884]  And again, this is just, I think Trump needs to, he doesn't need to focus on Kamala Harris right now.
[02:37:57.365 --> 02:37:58.526]  I don't think she's going to be the nominee.
[02:37:59.366 --> 02:38:06.070]  Not focus on the next one, but focus on, look, these elites are taking away all your freedoms, and just pay attention.
[02:38:06.110 --> 02:38:19.579]  A couple minutes a day, take your eyes off of TikTok, and try to pay attention from multiple sources if you can, because there are certain people in certain places, same names, that start the same wars, that are doing the same thing with printing money.
[02:38:19.418 --> 02:38:25.939]   It seems like the deep state is really starting to show its fangs right now because they're
[02:38:25.939 --> 02:38:30.498]   going down a short path here, but they do fight back and we saw that.
[02:38:30.498 --> 02:38:31.619]  Absolutely.
[02:38:31.619 --> 02:38:38.618]   And look, they may still remove Biden with the amendment they've got to do that even
[02:38:38.618 --> 02:38:42.938]   before he leaves because those special interests want full control.
[02:38:42.919 --> 02:38:49.174]   I think there's gonna be a fight at the nomination at this, again, undemocratic, Yeah, probably.
[02:38:49.054 --> 02:38:54.334]   thing they're going to be doing there in Chicago. And I'm really concerned about Gavin Newsom.
[02:38:54.334 --> 02:39:01.134]   I'm concerned about Michelle Obama. I'm concerned about obviously Kamala. They're all horrible.
[02:39:01.134 --> 02:39:06.174]   But Hillary suddenly has PR firms everywhere saying she should be the nominee or at least
[02:39:06.174 --> 02:39:11.134]   the vice president. I think of Kamala Harris or anybody else picks Hillary Clinton as their VP.
[02:39:11.134 --> 02:39:15.772]   They have got a suicide wish. Yeah, probably. It seems like it. I mean,
[02:39:16.494 --> 02:39:18.494]  They're gonna go somewhere else.
[02:39:18.240 --> 02:39:24.386]  I don't know if Michelle Obama wants it because she's already got the most powerful Democrats there, the Obamas.
[02:39:24.666 --> 02:39:27.088]  They're already making a lot more money and I don't know if she wants it.
[02:39:27.889 --> 02:39:32.113]  I think if Michelle Obama wanted to be president, she just needs to say yes and she'll get it.
[02:39:33.275 --> 02:39:38.179]  I don't think Gavin Newsom's good even though he'll get a lot of the votes from the people who don't pay attention just because he's good looking.
[02:39:41.425 --> 02:39:44.768]  We don't have any illegal immigrants in California.
[02:39:45.128 --> 02:39:49.292]  Speech is the same as the, yeah, I slept with the, uh, my campaign director's wife's speech.
[02:39:49.332 --> 02:39:50.894]  Like he just monotone, but he looks good.
[02:39:51.614 --> 02:39:53.996]  Um, I think they're going to pick someone else.
[02:39:54.156 --> 02:40:00.402]  I personally think Governor Shapiro from Pennsylvania because the Democrats will not win the White House without Pennsylvania.
[02:40:00.702 --> 02:40:02.083]  And he's, uh, he's moderate.
[02:40:02.103 --> 02:40:02.524]  He looks good.
[02:40:02.544 --> 02:40:03.585]  He sounded good after this.
[02:40:04.444 --> 02:40:14.847]  Um, but yeah, I mean, again, but it's not, I mean, Joe Biden wasn't running the country the entire, you know, the last three and a half years, but we were all called conspiracy theorists for saying it, but now they're just admitting it.
[02:40:15.147 --> 02:40:16.127]  What else are they lying about?
[02:40:16.147 --> 02:40:18.608]  So then it doesn't really matter as long as they get someone in there.
[02:40:18.728 --> 02:40:22.189]  If the Democrats are there, the people who are running the country now will continue to run it in the ground.
[02:40:22.708 --> 02:40:26.531]  Robert J. O'Neill, best-selling author, famous seal.
[02:40:26.551 --> 02:40:42.982]  It would take, again, 20 minutes to read all of his medals and decorations and combat laurels, and he's agreed, as soon as he gets back in town, soon, in the next few weeks, to come on the show and get into his book, get into Bin Laden, and get into what really happened there.
[02:40:43.002 --> 02:41:04.413]   You know, my views have changed over the years on that, and some of the viewers know that, some of the viewers have missed that, but I do respect him, and people that know him, I do respect The folks that he was involved with there, and the helicopter did blow up, and all the rest of it, and the very mysterious event on the helicopter, with all the SEALs that were involved in dying, tragically.
[02:41:04.834 --> 02:41:19.340]  A lot of weirdness, and we were talking before we went on air, and you were saying that, you know, my views have moved one direction some, and yours have moved kind of towards where I was, where in the past I didn't believe anything, and then I guess you were saying in the past you kind of did believe it, but now you're questioning a lot.
[02:41:21.013 --> 02:41:27.941]  Yeah, I mean, when I was a young Navy SEAL just after 9-11 and we announced we're going to invade Iraq, I was like, hell yeah, let's go in there, I will invade anybody.
[02:41:28.402 --> 02:41:39.075]  But just looking back on the reasons and the people that... Basically, the way that Iraq came down was because President Bush at the time didn't like Saddam Hussein because he wanted to assassinate his dad.
[02:41:39.555 --> 02:41:42.857]  So they had us invade Iraq and we fought there for a long, long time.
[02:41:42.877 --> 02:41:44.098]  A lot of people were killed.
[02:41:44.138 --> 02:41:45.038]  A lot of veterans were killed.
[02:41:45.258 --> 02:41:46.579]  Excuse me, a lot of veterans are suffering.
[02:41:46.819 --> 02:41:47.760]  PTSD type stuff.
[02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:49.481]  But I mean, killed, named, wounded.
[02:41:49.941 --> 02:41:51.822]  And we went there under false promises.
[02:41:51.902 --> 02:41:59.706]  So I wonder, you know, I just, I wonder about, once I left the Navy too, I worked on Capitol Hill for a while and I got a seat behind the curtains too.
[02:42:00.046 --> 02:42:01.427]  And like I mentioned before, same names.
[02:42:01.447 --> 02:42:03.248]  Like Hillary Clinton's name is still coming up.
[02:42:03.708 --> 02:42:04.268]  Like right now.
[02:42:05.109 --> 02:42:06.370]  And it's the same people in power.
[02:42:07.950 --> 02:42:14.973]  I'm a big believer that just because you end a war doesn't mean the contracts end, and we need to find places to send the tanks and missiles and bombs and guns.
[02:42:15.214 --> 02:42:16.794]  That's why we always leave everything behind, too.
[02:42:16.954 --> 02:42:19.235]  Look at all the stuff we left back in Afghanistan.
[02:42:19.255 --> 02:42:20.316]  Look at all the stuff we left in Vietnam.
[02:42:20.776 --> 02:42:23.717]  Well, just because we left it there, I guess we gotta make more.
[02:42:23.757 --> 02:42:25.298]  I guess my buddy gets a bigger contract.
[02:42:26.468 --> 02:42:37.093]  It's always war, or a fear of war, and the government knows with a little bit of fear, they can take a little bit of your liberty away, a bit at a time, and they'll make you think that they're doing you a favor.
[02:42:37.233 --> 02:42:38.473]  And now they want war with Russia.
[02:42:38.493 --> 02:42:39.834]  What do you think of the escalation there?
[02:42:41.395 --> 02:42:43.535]  I wish we knew what was actually going on in Ukraine.
[02:42:43.555 --> 02:42:45.716]  I mean, we know that Russia did invade.
[02:42:46.157 --> 02:42:47.357]  I didn't think they would, but they did.
[02:42:47.917 --> 02:42:49.698]  But, you know, they're going to play on our fears now.
[02:42:49.738 --> 02:42:51.679]  Well, next is Poland, next is NATO.
[02:42:52.759 --> 02:42:55.001]  Me personally, this is NATO's problem.
[02:42:55.041 --> 02:42:57.383]  This is Europe's problem.
[02:42:57.644 --> 02:43:02.188]  But a lot of people are making a lot of money off stuff that they're going to keep telling us.
[02:43:04.565 --> 02:43:08.827]  And again, I don't think Vladimir Putin's a great guy, but they're going to keep telling us he's Hitler.
[02:43:08.847 --> 02:43:10.228]  Well, everyone's Hitler they disagree with.
[02:43:10.668 --> 02:43:12.369]  And then they're going to get us to keep spinning with that.
[02:43:12.589 --> 02:43:13.030]  Exactly.
[02:43:13.390 --> 02:43:16.592]  But it all comes down to where can we send more?
[02:43:16.632 --> 02:43:18.192]  How can we make more money out of this gig?
[02:43:18.713 --> 02:43:24.456]  It's like watching members of Congress go into Congress with not so much money, but then all of a sudden they become the best stock pickers in the world.
[02:43:25.638 --> 02:43:26.900]  I think it's all related.
[02:43:26.940 --> 02:43:28.441]  It all comes down to personal power and money.
[02:43:28.842 --> 02:43:29.963]  Robert, we've only got a minute left.
[02:43:29.983 --> 02:43:30.904]  I think I'm going to catch a plane.
[02:43:30.944 --> 02:43:31.705]  Thank you for the time.
[02:43:31.985 --> 02:43:33.146]  Robertjoneal.com.
[02:43:33.166 --> 02:43:41.936]  Everybody should get your number one best-selling book, The Operator, Firing the Shots that Killed Bin Laden and My Ears as a SEAL Team Operator.
[02:43:42.136 --> 02:43:44.198]  And let's just hope and pray for President Trump.
[02:43:45.300 --> 02:43:47.402]  Do you think the deep state will try another run at him?
[02:43:49.699 --> 02:43:50.819]  I don't know what they're going to do.
[02:43:50.859 --> 02:43:52.900]  I mean, you know, they showed their ass.
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:54.980]  So I think it's securely going to be tight.
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:56.600]  I hope Eric Prince brings some of his dudes in there.
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:43:57.541]  There's some bad dudes.
[02:43:58.261 --> 02:43:59.461]  I mean, they're going to try something else.
[02:43:59.761 --> 02:44:00.701]  There's always something.
[02:44:00.721 --> 02:44:04.222]  There's always that October surprise or whatever they call it.
[02:44:04.562 --> 02:44:06.262]  So I hope it's not deadly.
[02:44:06.302 --> 02:44:07.822]  But I mean, look at the times we're living in now.
[02:44:08.643 --> 02:44:13.643]  Nothing seems like it's off the table again, because once people get power, they certainly don't want to get rid of it.
[02:44:14.204 --> 02:44:15.564]  Robert O'Neill, Godspeed.
[02:44:15.604 --> 02:44:16.384]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:44:17.392 --> 02:44:18.413]  Thanks Alex, appreciate it, anytime.
[02:44:18.573 --> 02:44:19.894]  Can't wait to interview you for a full hour.
[02:44:20.914 --> 02:44:33.262]  We've seen a lot of people, and a lot of corporate media, and a lot of pundits, and I see a lot, thousands of articles, the last month saying, inflow wars will imminently be shut down.
[02:44:34.783 --> 02:44:46.671]  And they panicked, with a federally appointed CRO, and federally appointed US trustee from the Justice Department, and five weeks ago, ordered this place shut without a court order.
[02:44:47.950 --> 02:44:51.692]  The judge excoriated them, fired them three weeks ago.
[02:44:51.712 --> 02:44:59.657]  Then two weeks ago, the Democrat Party lawyers that use the Sandy Hook parents as a front group came in and said we want him shut down today.
[02:45:00.057 --> 02:45:01.298]  The judge shut that down.
[02:45:01.898 --> 02:45:05.600]  Then they tried to grab InfoWars a week and a half ago at the state court.
[02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:07.521]  The judge said that's illegal and shut that down.
[02:45:07.741 --> 02:45:08.362]  This is epic.
[02:45:08.842 --> 02:45:10.243]  People say, how is this continuing on?
[02:45:10.283 --> 02:45:11.203]  Because we're fighting.
[02:45:11.764 --> 02:45:12.624]  We're not giving up.
[02:45:12.744 --> 02:45:13.365]  You're praying.
[02:45:14.065 --> 02:45:18.126]  But I love how five weeks ago I told you this happened, and like, oh yeah, they came out in order to shut it down.
[02:45:18.666 --> 02:45:20.447]  You stood up to them and all this, but where's the video?
[02:45:20.627 --> 02:45:22.207]  You want on top of that video?
[02:45:22.567 --> 02:45:23.267]  Confronting people?
[02:45:23.627 --> 02:45:24.467]  This is serious.
[02:45:24.507 --> 02:45:25.388]  I tried the non-escalate.
[02:45:26.488 --> 02:45:27.748]  Now it's all in the court record.
[02:45:27.848 --> 02:45:28.548]  Of course it's true.
[02:45:28.568 --> 02:45:29.629]  Of course I didn't make this up.
[02:45:29.689 --> 02:45:30.449]  I don't cry wolf.
[02:45:31.489 --> 02:45:38.171]  So, we are surrounded by wolves, but we've got God on our side, and we've got the people that love God supporting us.
[02:45:38.231 --> 02:45:43.332]  So, I need all of you to understand that we're still here for at least three months.
[02:45:44.500 --> 02:45:50.563]  But if people think we're not going to be here and don't support them, fullwordstore.com, with great sales and great products, we'll shut down by extension.
[02:45:50.603 --> 02:45:51.224]  That's been happening.
[02:45:51.464 --> 02:45:52.484]  People aren't buying stuff.
[02:45:53.165 --> 02:45:55.066]  Even though we're selling all the products, it's gone away.
[02:45:55.086 --> 02:45:56.146]  Do they think we're about to be shut down?
[02:45:56.206 --> 02:45:56.346]  No.
[02:45:56.727 --> 02:45:57.887]  You order something, you get it.
[02:45:58.227 --> 02:46:05.531]  And so it'll be you that decides to shut us down if you don't go there and get X2 and X3 and Vitamineral Fusion about to sell it and all of it.
[02:46:05.971 --> 02:46:08.333]  But what I want to talk to you about is a fundraiser.
[02:46:09.013 --> 02:46:17.219]  We have a couple thousand copies of the number one worldwide bestseller, The Great Awakening, The Plan to Defeat the Globalists and Launch the Next Great Renaissance.
[02:46:17.799 --> 02:46:19.060]  Huge thick book I wrote.
[02:46:19.581 --> 02:46:20.982]  Just came out six, eight months ago.
[02:46:21.983 --> 02:46:24.825]  There are a few thousand signed copies left, and it is a fundraiser.
[02:46:25.285 --> 02:46:40.196]   I want to thank those of you that got a signed copy, but I want to encourage all of you That have not gotten a signed copy and you want a chance to support the broadcast and know that at the critical juncture you fought to get the funds in to keep operating because we're right on the edge of the red and the black.
[02:46:41.316 --> 02:46:47.858]  To go now to infowarestore.com and get The Great Awakening today.
[02:46:47.938 --> 02:46:52.259]  And there's almost 3,000 copies left of this signed, 1,000 copies unsigned.
[02:46:53.179 --> 02:46:57.140]  There's also about 700 copies of The Great Reset, the predecessor book to this.
[02:46:59.330 --> 02:47:02.812]  And unless we get a buyer and things change and, you know, whatever, we'll be shut down in a few months.
[02:47:02.852 --> 02:47:05.453]  But we will probably continue on.
[02:47:05.533 --> 02:47:06.594]  God's hand is on us.
[02:47:06.634 --> 02:47:07.455]  The force is with us.
[02:47:08.315 --> 02:47:09.496]  Please go now.
[02:47:09.776 --> 02:47:17.480]  It's in stock, ready to ship at InfoWarstore.com and get The Great Awakening, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:18.060 --> 02:47:20.642]  Defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[02:47:20.762 --> 02:47:24.163]  And when these signed copies are gone here, they're going to be gone.
[02:47:24.224 --> 02:47:26.565]  I'm going to sign this right now.
[02:47:29.260 --> 02:47:34.861]  2024.

[02:47:43.263 --> 02:47:43.483]  All right.

[02:48:20.563 --> 02:48:22.644]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:48:23.424 --> 02:48:29.727]  Yep, and there was your cover of the magazine, and just as that gentleman was saying, you know, about the war in Ukraine.
[02:48:30.347 --> 02:48:34.849]  If Napoleon couldn't beat Russia, what is he, left Poland with 420,000 troops?
[02:48:36.090 --> 02:48:46.614]  If Hitler couldn't beat Russia, Operation Barbarossa, where they killed over 25 million Russians in World War II, and the Russians were the first to defeat the Germans?
[02:48:47.901 --> 02:48:53.144]  So you got a guy that plays the piano with his penis as a sitcom actor.
[02:48:55.125 --> 02:48:58.607]  Now, the president of the Ukraine, oh yeah, he's gonna, they're gonna beat Russia.
[02:48:59.908 --> 02:49:01.489]  Yeah, I mean, this is sick.
[02:49:01.609 --> 02:49:02.570]  It's crazy crap.
[02:49:02.750 --> 02:49:07.193]  Because we have a bunch of crazy crap heads running a country near you.
[02:49:07.213 --> 02:49:14.337]  And if you'd have to see any more of the crap head crap, all you gotta do is look at just what's happening now.
[02:49:16.872 --> 02:49:18.093]  Kamala Harris, right?
[02:49:19.934 --> 02:49:35.262]  My fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and my focus on all my energies on my duties as president for the remainder of my term.
[02:49:37.503 --> 02:49:39.644]  Focus all my energies on my duties?
[02:49:40.584 --> 02:49:41.365]  What energies?
[02:49:42.505 --> 02:49:43.346]  What energies?
[02:49:44.884 --> 02:49:47.966]  We had a cover of the Trends Journal several weeks ago.
[02:49:48.627 --> 02:49:55.952]  America was falling and had pictures of Trump, of Biden falling everywhere.
[02:49:57.193 --> 02:49:57.773]  He goes on.
[02:49:58.914 --> 02:50:06.219]  My first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my vice president.
[02:50:07.900 --> 02:50:08.821]  Kamala Harris.
[02:50:09.221 --> 02:50:12.143]  Tell me about all the great things Kamala Harris has been doing.
[02:50:12.243 --> 02:50:14.285]  Oh, she did a great job down there at the border, I forgot.
[02:50:18.849 --> 02:50:25.695]  Anyway, as my Vice President, and it's been the best decision I've made.
[02:50:26.115 --> 02:50:26.536]  Oh, yeah.
[02:50:27.016 --> 02:50:28.457]  Oh, the best decision you made?
[02:50:28.477 --> 02:50:29.538]  Yeah, there he is.
[02:50:29.598 --> 02:50:30.819]  Yeah, the fall of America.
[02:50:31.820 --> 02:50:33.882]  Again, right in front of your eyes.
[02:50:35.984 --> 02:50:40.267]  It's a freak show and you got the freaks running the show.
[02:50:42.269 --> 02:50:43.790]  The best decision I've made.
[02:50:44.071 --> 02:50:45.292]  The best decision you made?
[02:50:47.466 --> 02:50:49.908]  Oh, you mean all those other ones are all great decisions?
[02:50:50.508 --> 02:50:54.111]  Stealing all our money to keep the Ukraine war going?
[02:50:54.171 --> 02:50:55.372]  Oh, that's great, man!
[02:50:55.392 --> 02:50:56.533]  That's great!
[02:50:56.873 --> 02:51:00.095]  Oh, how about all your lockdown BS, huh?
[02:51:00.595 --> 02:51:02.237]  That was terrific!
[02:51:02.817 --> 02:51:06.139]  Hey, how about all those jabs you got for COVID, man?
[02:51:06.399 --> 02:51:08.321]  And whoop, got it again, huh?
[02:51:10.888 --> 02:51:12.189]  This is the clown show!
[02:51:12.730 --> 02:51:19.998]  It's a freak show in front of everybody's eyes for all to see, and now you got a new freak on top!
[02:51:21.439 --> 02:51:21.639]  Yep.
[02:51:22.761 --> 02:51:23.541]  Kamala Harris.
[02:51:24.743 --> 02:51:25.744]  Oh, great, man.
[02:51:26.445 --> 02:51:29.628]  I hear about she, you know, sexed her way into where she got, you know.
[02:51:29.928 --> 02:51:30.989]  Oh, that's not true.
[02:51:31.270 --> 02:51:31.550]  Oh, yeah.
[02:51:33.556 --> 02:51:36.758]  Going with the guy who was the mayor of San Francisco, all that kind of stuff.
[02:51:36.818 --> 02:51:37.158]  Oh, yeah.
[02:51:37.238 --> 02:51:38.339]  Oh, don't talk about that.
[02:51:38.759 --> 02:51:40.220]  It's one big club.
[02:51:40.540 --> 02:51:44.382]  It's one big, dirty, disgusting, rotten club.
[02:51:44.822 --> 02:51:45.803]  Both sides.
[02:51:46.443 --> 02:51:47.464]  Both sides.
[02:51:47.964 --> 02:51:57.069]  It is a crime syndicate that morons and imbeciles call a government.
[02:51:57.730 --> 02:51:59.891]  They're murderers and thieves.
[02:52:01.556 --> 02:52:11.139]  By their deeds you shall know them, and we're going to make it clearer for all those that are too deaf, dumb, and blind to see and hear it.
[02:52:13.099 --> 02:52:24.349]   He goes on to say, Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee Of our party!
[02:52:24.889 --> 02:52:25.750]  Our party!
[02:52:26.370 --> 02:52:28.850]  Our bunch of slimeballs!
[02:52:29.691 --> 02:52:35.252]  Our bunch of murderous, lying, stealing SOBs!
[02:52:36.412 --> 02:52:36.592]  Yep.
[02:52:38.193 --> 02:52:41.113]  It's time to come together and beat Trump.
[02:52:41.854 --> 02:52:42.414]  Let's do it.
[02:52:42.474 --> 02:52:43.314]  Oh, come together?
[02:52:43.334 --> 02:52:44.914]  Oh, she was going out with that guy.
[02:52:44.934 --> 02:52:45.815]  Were they coming together?
[02:52:45.875 --> 02:52:46.735]  I don't know.
[02:52:46.795 --> 02:52:47.595]  That's a story.
[02:52:48.522 --> 02:52:49.623]  Look, we're going to be right back.
[02:52:49.663 --> 02:52:51.725]  Do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[02:52:51.765 --> 02:52:52.766]  It's a critical time.
[02:52:52.786 --> 02:52:55.528]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:52:55.548 --> 02:52:56.869]  Remember what I'm saying, man?
[02:52:57.189 --> 02:53:00.772]  Anyway, man, do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[02:53:01.693 --> 02:53:03.995]  Because we are in a very critical time.
[02:53:05.056 --> 02:53:08.879]  And now, again, I'm no fan of Trump, as everybody knows.
[02:53:08.939 --> 02:53:09.860]  I don't like any of them.
[02:53:10.460 --> 02:53:13.222]  But the other side is going to be worse in different ways.
[02:53:13.963 --> 02:53:16.205]  And one of them is going to be more and more censorship.
[02:53:17.722 --> 02:53:25.265]  And they're going to do everything they can, at least Trump gets in there, they're not going to blacklist people like the Democrats have.
[02:53:26.626 --> 02:53:28.487]  And again, the facts are all there.
[02:53:29.067 --> 02:53:33.469]  Remember, let's everybody get this straight.
[02:53:35.750 --> 02:53:45.754]  Again, covers of our magazine showing Biden out of his mind, and out of his mind, jerk off over there in Washington.
[02:53:47.682 --> 02:53:49.383]  But he's making a decision.
[02:53:49.703 --> 02:53:51.983]  Hey, Kamala Harris, come on, you can run.
[02:53:52.584 --> 02:53:53.784]  I'm out of my mind.
[02:53:54.804 --> 02:53:58.346]  I can't run for president anymore because I'm so screwed up.
[02:53:58.666 --> 02:54:03.067]  But I'm going to stay president even though I'm out of my mind.
[02:54:04.708 --> 02:54:08.729]  This is going to go down in history.
[02:54:08.749 --> 02:54:11.990]  They're going to make comic books out of this.
[02:54:12.770 --> 02:54:14.331]  Comic books are going to come back.
[02:54:15.618 --> 02:54:27.374]  This is the decline of the Roman Empire when you saw all those freaks that were in the, you know, running the show, out of their minds, doing crappy crap.
[02:54:28.192 --> 02:54:29.733]  Bringing down the empire.
[02:54:30.193 --> 02:54:32.755]  We got him in front of our eyes now.
[02:54:32.995 --> 02:54:35.596]  Oh, you like Kenny Cruz over there on the Republican side?
[02:54:35.936 --> 02:54:37.357]  Oh, I like Lindsey Graham.
[02:54:37.537 --> 02:54:39.578]  Did you come out of the closet yet, Lindsey?
[02:54:39.798 --> 02:54:41.399]  You little warmongering freak.
[02:54:41.739 --> 02:54:43.360]  Oh no, I like Nancy Pelosi.
[02:54:43.660 --> 02:54:45.241]  Oh, Chuckie Schumer's the guy for me.
[02:54:45.581 --> 02:54:47.062]  Oh, I'm Chuckie Schumer.
[02:54:47.382 --> 02:54:49.223]  All right?
[02:54:51.625 --> 02:54:53.426]  This is running the country?
[02:54:54.846 --> 02:54:55.847]  Kamala Harris, huh?
[02:54:57.648 --> 02:55:07.303]  I was on Infowars last Monday, right about this time, and they announced that Vance was going to be the VP candidate.
[02:55:07.323 --> 02:55:09.326]  That's not a good choice.
[02:55:09.386 --> 02:55:10.688]  And again, I know this business.
[02:55:12.491 --> 02:55:17.310]   Again, Worked on major political campaigns in Westchester County in the 1970s.
[02:55:17.690 --> 02:55:20.152]  Was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate.
[02:55:20.472 --> 02:55:23.875]  Designed and instructed American politics and campaign technology.
[02:55:24.175 --> 02:55:25.877]  How to run political campaigns.
[02:55:26.217 --> 02:55:27.238]  And I taught it at St.
[02:55:27.298 --> 02:55:28.319]  John's University.
[02:55:28.559 --> 02:55:29.920]  So I'm not some rookie!
[02:55:31.321 --> 02:55:36.645]  The people in politics are the biggest low-life rookies you could find!
[02:55:37.446 --> 02:55:39.127]  That's why they get into the business.
[02:55:40.468 --> 02:55:45.382]   I got into it because I was living in the city and having a hard time.
[02:55:45.402 --> 02:55:48.962]  And my mother passed away.
[02:55:49.022 --> 02:55:50.303]  I'm going back a lot of years.
[02:55:50.323 --> 02:55:53.304]  I had two younger sisters living in Yonkers.
[02:55:54.244 --> 02:55:56.244]  And I went up there to help my father take care of them.
[02:55:58.765 --> 02:55:59.605]  And what am I gonna do?
[02:56:00.005 --> 02:56:03.306]  I see these guys running for mayor of Yonkers, Angelo Martinelli.
[02:56:03.366 --> 02:56:04.346]  Let me see what this is about.
[02:56:04.866 --> 02:56:05.486]  And I got in it.
[02:56:05.606 --> 02:56:07.007]  And I got hit the top right away.
[02:56:07.047 --> 02:56:07.807]  They were grooming me.
[02:56:07.967 --> 02:56:09.247]  That's why they sent me up to Albany.
[02:56:09.647 --> 02:56:11.868]  To be assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate.
[02:56:12.572 --> 02:56:18.294]  It was the worst job, the worst job I ever had in my life.
[02:56:18.995 --> 02:56:20.395]  And I've been working all my life.
[02:56:20.415 --> 02:56:23.877]  One of the best jobs I had was I was a soda jerk.
[02:56:24.677 --> 02:56:25.137]  Yerks.
[02:56:25.357 --> 02:56:29.379]  You don't know what a soda... After high school, all the kids used to go to a soda fountain.
[02:56:29.819 --> 02:56:31.800]  And I met my beautiful girlfriend there.
[02:56:33.161 --> 02:56:34.061]  Working all my life.
[02:56:36.322 --> 02:56:38.663]  Bunch of young guys standing in the back of the chamber.
[02:56:40.438 --> 02:56:43.399]  They got a clown, a sergeant at arms!
[02:56:43.799 --> 02:56:46.539]  A sergeant at arms opening the door!
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:48.660]  Senator Frank Jones!
[02:56:49.300 --> 02:56:51.341]  Senator- What's the matter with these guys?
[02:56:51.361 --> 02:56:52.521]  Can't open the door by themselves?
[02:56:54.141 --> 02:56:55.142]  What is this crap?
[02:56:55.182 --> 02:57:00.623]  I'm paying for this sloppy jerk to open doors and announce when one of these jerks are walking in?
[02:57:01.763 --> 02:57:03.144]  And my buddies used to leave me.
[02:57:04.144 --> 02:57:05.544]  I said, what are we talking about?
[02:57:05.604 --> 02:57:08.785]  My young guy talking about girls, cars, and sports.
[02:57:09.926 --> 02:57:11.787]  They'd follow the senator to his seat.
[02:57:12.448 --> 02:57:13.628]  Could blow on these things.
[02:57:14.028 --> 02:57:14.609]  And they'd move.
[02:57:15.489 --> 02:57:16.410]  And help him sit down.
[02:57:18.271 --> 02:57:19.812]  Come back and I say, man, what's the matter?
[02:57:19.872 --> 02:57:21.353]  Cat can't sit down by himself?
[02:57:21.793 --> 02:57:22.374]  Need some help?
[02:57:23.934 --> 02:57:25.836]  So you know, Gerald, you have that kind of an attitude.
[02:57:25.856 --> 02:57:26.856]  You're not gonna make it here.
[02:57:28.297 --> 02:57:28.777]  You're right, man.
[02:57:29.178 --> 02:57:30.939]  I ain't gonna make it here.
[02:57:31.999 --> 02:57:33.060]  One year I was gone.
[02:57:33.080 --> 02:57:33.820]  I was gone.
[02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:34.721]  I was out of there.
[02:57:35.410 --> 02:57:40.554]  My best friend at the time, may he rest in peace, Brian Donahue, whose wife became the lieutenant governor in the Pataki.
[02:57:40.574 --> 02:57:41.675]  I was right there.
[02:57:42.555 --> 02:57:43.796]  It's a freak show!
[02:57:44.577 --> 02:57:49.881]  It's a bunch of gutless, little, low-life, arrogant boys and girls!
[02:57:51.943 --> 02:57:59.849]  As my t-shirt perfectly says, you can get this at trendsjournal.com.
[02:58:02.210 --> 02:58:02.871]  And there's the back.
[02:58:05.509 --> 02:58:08.430]  And that's who's running the show.
[02:58:08.890 --> 02:58:20.912]  So going back to the freak show, this is from Camilla Harris needs to win over her doubters and detractors, analysts say.
[02:58:21.312 --> 02:58:22.473]  This is CNBC.
[02:58:23.553 --> 02:58:44.290]   With just over 100 days until the presidential election in November, Harris has to win over not only Democratic delegates, donors, And secure an official nomination by the party, but also, most crucially, her detractors and undecided voters.
[02:58:44.831 --> 02:58:46.911]  Me morons and imbeciles.
[02:58:48.151 --> 02:58:48.831]  She could win.
[02:58:51.272 --> 02:58:57.193]  And I make this clear, again, last person I voted for president was Ron Paul.
[02:58:57.693 --> 02:59:24.528]   And by the way, a great article on InfoWars by Dr. Ron Paul, And I applaud InfoWars for putting this up there because it also is about not a great thing that the Republicans did at the... Ron Paul, Republican platform ignores real causes of inflation.
[02:59:24.708 --> 02:59:25.648]  Yeah, there's the t-shirt.
[02:59:26.348 --> 02:59:27.829]  You go to Trends Journal and you get it.
[02:59:29.637 --> 02:59:31.859]  And there's this viral video that's gone out.
[02:59:31.899 --> 02:59:37.002]  Some guy did a rap song of me going, F you to tell me what to do.
[02:59:38.743 --> 02:59:38.983]  Yeah.
[02:59:39.784 --> 02:59:41.885]  But anyway, it's both sides.
[02:59:43.146 --> 02:59:52.612]  The 2024 Republican platform promises that if Donald Trump returns to the White House and Republicans gain complete control of Congress, they will reduce inflation.
[02:59:53.053 --> 03:00:02.915]   The platform contains some proposals Such as reducing regulations, extending the 2017 tax reductions that may help lower prices in some sectors and spur economic growth.
[03:00:02.955 --> 03:00:12.738]  However, the GOP platform does not address how the Federal Reserve is enabling the spend-a-holic politicians who contributed to the price inflation.
[03:00:13.138 --> 03:00:26.211]   Again, so InfoWars is why I'm saying to you it's important, you know, as much as they're on one side of Liking one candidate over another, they print and put out both sides.
[03:00:27.532 --> 03:00:29.093]  And that's what we do at the Trends Journal.
[03:00:29.133 --> 03:00:51.620]   So going back to this clown lady who's running, a major issue that's going to get voters out to vote for Harris that has nothing to do She's a warmonger supporter.
[03:00:54.142 --> 03:00:57.805]  Both wars, Ukraine and the Israeli war.
[03:01:00.887 --> 03:01:01.747]  Both sides.
[03:01:06.350 --> 03:01:26.169]   What's going to get her votes, and it's why the Republicans did lousy on the midterm elections, which We, in the Trends Journal, said they would not do well because of one major issue.
[03:01:30.032 --> 03:01:30.653]  Pro-choice.
[03:01:32.835 --> 03:01:33.655]  Roe vs. Wade.
[03:01:35.057 --> 03:01:35.797]  That's the issue.
[03:01:38.840 --> 03:01:39.981]  She's pro-choice.
[03:01:42.083 --> 03:01:44.365]  Vance, very much against it.
[03:01:46.209 --> 03:01:47.970]  Trump seems on the fence about it.
[03:01:49.131 --> 03:01:56.535]  That is going to be a major issue that is going to get young voters out, particularly women.
[03:01:57.495 --> 03:02:02.838]  Again, like it, don't like it, that's not what we do.
[03:02:03.639 --> 03:02:04.859]  We're political atheists.
[03:02:04.939 --> 03:02:09.322]  We don't take positions on things when we report on them.
[03:02:09.682 --> 03:02:20.732]   We have our beliefs, like one that both parties hate, Peace on Earth, goodwill to all.
[03:02:22.154 --> 03:02:22.394]  Yeah.
[03:02:25.296 --> 03:02:28.539]  And the former guy just heard part of it that was in the military.
[03:02:32.562 --> 03:02:34.163]  I support the founding fathers.
[03:02:38.226 --> 03:02:40.488]  Don't become involved in any foreign entanglements.
[03:02:41.329 --> 03:02:44.911]  I've read Washington's speech over and over again.
[03:02:46.953 --> 03:02:50.618]   Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi backs Harris.
[03:02:53.119 --> 03:02:53.279]  Great.
[03:02:53.299 --> 03:02:55.399]  Isn't that great?
[03:02:59.061 --> 03:03:01.221]  Nancy Pelosi, look at the freak show.
[03:03:05.203 --> 03:03:05.403]  Yep.
[03:03:06.403 --> 03:03:15.226]  Today is with immense pride and limitless optimism for our country's future that I endorse.
[03:03:17.187 --> 03:03:19.380]   Limitless Optimism?
[03:03:19.520 --> 03:03:21.041]  Our country's future?
[03:03:21.441 --> 03:03:22.642]  Who the hell are you talking to?
[03:03:22.662 --> 03:03:24.243]  WHO AM I TALKING TO?
[03:03:24.643 --> 03:03:26.204]  SHUT THE HELL UP SALENTI!
[03:03:26.865 --> 03:03:29.707]  I'M TALKING TO THE AVERAGE AMERICAN PERSON!
[03:03:30.167 --> 03:03:32.489]  WITH A BRAIN BIGGER THAN A PEA!
[03:03:33.870 --> 03:03:36.051]  THEY KNOW ALL ABOUT TAYLOR SWIFT!
[03:03:38.153 --> 03:03:39.634]  THAT'S WHO I'M TALKING TO!
[03:03:40.515 --> 03:03:42.576]  I'M NOT TALKING TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU!
[03:03:43.297 --> 03:03:44.257]  WHO KNOW FACTS!
[03:03:47.479 --> 03:03:47.900]  Oh yeah!
[03:03:49.386 --> 03:03:53.609]  It's one big club and you ain't in it, George Collins said.
[03:03:53.950 --> 03:03:56.171]  You look at the Pelosi gang!
[03:03:57.012 --> 03:04:00.135]  Oh yeah, daddy was down here, Baltimore brother, yeah, yeah.
[03:04:00.515 --> 03:04:05.078]  Look at how Harris got into the system.
[03:04:07.500 --> 03:04:11.043]  Look how Vance, we got one article after another.
[03:04:11.724 --> 03:04:18.569]  One article after another in tomorrow's Trends Journal that's coming up about how Vance got in there.
[03:04:19.349 --> 03:04:21.490]  And again, this isn't from us.
[03:04:22.171 --> 03:04:24.872]  What we do is we follow the news.
[03:04:26.133 --> 03:04:29.775]  How Silicon Valley aid advances leap into power.
[03:04:29.795 --> 03:04:33.057]  Oh, that's from the toilet paper record.
[03:04:34.338 --> 03:04:36.359]  Oh, this is from the Financial Times.
[03:04:36.379 --> 03:04:43.903]  I mean, Repulskins added $400 million in funds to tighten money race.
[03:04:46.045 --> 03:04:53.433]   Financial Times, tech titans, Line up to fund former president's re-election.
[03:04:55.735 --> 03:04:55.915]  Yep.
[03:04:57.496 --> 03:05:10.027]  And to show you, to show you what a low-life piece of warmongering crap, that little vans where I was in the Marines, good for you.
[03:05:11.503 --> 03:05:13.364]  I don't want to be in the Marines.
[03:05:13.924 --> 03:05:17.725]  I avoided the Vietnam draft because I didn't want to get my brains blown out.
[03:05:18.245 --> 03:05:24.246]  And I was stupid enough to believe the crap that Richard Nixon was shoving out there and LB Jerkoff.
[03:05:26.607 --> 03:05:28.787]  This is what, this is what Vance says.
[03:05:32.528 --> 03:05:43.594]   The most important part of the Trump doctrine of foreign policy Is you don't commit America's troops unless you really have to.
[03:05:43.934 --> 03:05:44.374]  I agree.
[03:05:45.215 --> 03:05:49.978]  But when you do, you punch and you punch hard.
[03:05:51.118 --> 03:05:51.599]  Yeah, there it is.
[03:05:51.619 --> 03:05:53.940]  Yeah.
[03:05:54.140 --> 03:05:55.581]  This is why you go to Infowars.
[03:05:55.601 --> 03:05:56.662]  They put the facts there.
[03:05:57.542 --> 03:05:58.563]  They put the facts there.
[03:05:58.783 --> 03:06:06.728]  The banks, the bandits are going to go on the Trump side, on the on the Biden, Harris side and the Silicon Valley gang.
[03:06:07.737 --> 03:06:09.999]  Is gonna go on the Trump Van side.
[03:06:10.079 --> 03:06:10.899]  All the facts are there.
[03:06:10.919 --> 03:06:12.320]  Again, the teal, the whole thing.
[03:06:13.941 --> 03:06:26.330]  But when you punch, and you punch hard, a lot of people recognize that we need to do something with Iran, but not these weak little bombing runs.
[03:06:27.631 --> 03:06:32.835]  If you're going to punch the Iranians, you punch them hard!
[03:06:35.809 --> 03:06:37.530]  Isn't that nice?
[03:06:39.930 --> 03:06:42.371]  You little piece of scum!
[03:06:42.391 --> 03:06:45.892]  What have the Iranians done to us?
[03:06:47.712 --> 03:06:48.773]  Oh, I forgot.
[03:06:48.793 --> 03:06:50.033]  Here.
[03:06:51.393 --> 03:06:52.154]  One of my books.
[03:06:53.254 --> 03:06:53.974]  Where is it here?
[03:06:56.775 --> 03:06:57.615]  Trend Tracking.
[03:06:58.355 --> 03:07:00.576]  Far better than Megatrends, Time Magazine.
[03:07:02.877 --> 03:07:05.954]   Tells you when I became A trend forecaster.
[03:07:06.534 --> 03:07:09.356]  The Iranian conflict was going on.
[03:07:11.117 --> 03:07:16.982]  Just as they taught us when I'm a little kid to hate the Russians had us hiding under a desk in case an atom bomb went off.
[03:07:18.543 --> 03:07:19.864]  All our lives to hate the Russians.
[03:07:22.445 --> 03:07:24.767]  Even though they were our allies in World War II.
[03:07:28.029 --> 03:07:28.890]  Same thing with Iran.
[03:07:30.851 --> 03:07:31.672]  So here's the story.
[03:07:33.393 --> 03:07:36.135]  Late 1970s, the Iranian conflict starts breaking out.
[03:07:36.155 --> 03:07:37.436]  They want to get rid of the Shah.
[03:07:38.176 --> 03:07:40.298]  Oh, you didn't hear about the Sivak, the secret police?
[03:07:41.118 --> 03:07:41.279]  No.
[03:07:41.979 --> 03:07:44.581]  You didn't know about Kermit Roosevelt?
[03:07:44.641 --> 03:07:46.082]  Again, one big club.
[03:07:46.682 --> 03:07:49.624]  Oh, yeah, the great-grandson of Theodore Roosevelt?
[03:07:49.664 --> 03:07:50.065]  Yeah.
[03:07:50.825 --> 03:07:53.927]  Oh, yeah, the guy that went into Cuba, that murdering guy?
[03:07:54.007 --> 03:07:55.188]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:07:55.348 --> 03:07:56.049]  He was with the CIA.
[03:07:58.522 --> 03:08:06.367]  Winston Churchill, a little clown warmongering jerk, off over there in the UK, with an F for you and a C in it.
[03:08:06.407 --> 03:08:07.367]  Yeah, that UK.
[03:08:09.728 --> 03:08:12.070]  It wasn't reported in the media until 2017.
[03:08:12.810 --> 03:08:29.144]   And the only papers, none in the Americas picked it up, only in Financial Times, about how the United States colluded, the MI6 and the CIA colluded, to overthrow the democratically elected government, Mosaddegh.
[03:08:31.486 --> 03:08:32.227]  In Iran.
[03:08:34.268 --> 03:08:35.829]  This is when I became a political atheist.
[03:08:38.071 --> 03:08:40.793]  People don't know about the SAVAK, the secret police, do they, huh?
[03:08:40.833 --> 03:08:42.474]  That they brought in to keep the Shah there?
[03:08:43.214 --> 03:08:44.495]  Murder, killing, yep.
[03:08:45.096 --> 03:08:47.677]  Oh, but they were buying a lot of weapons.
[03:08:48.218 --> 03:08:52.821]  So that was American military-industrial complex that the gentleman talked about before, talked about.
[03:08:52.841 --> 03:08:55.363]  You know, they were buying planes, everything.
[03:08:56.474 --> 03:09:00.435]  This thing started, and I'm watching millions of people get into the streets.
[03:09:00.455 --> 03:09:02.536]  I said, they're going to overthrow the Shah.
[03:09:06.717 --> 03:09:07.337]  So what happens?
[03:09:08.238 --> 03:09:09.978]  The revolution, they overthrow the Shah.
[03:09:10.038 --> 03:09:12.239]  Jimmy Carter goes there just before the overthrow.
[03:09:12.839 --> 03:09:15.740]  Spends New Year's Eve there with his wife, Rosalind.
[03:09:16.980 --> 03:09:18.861]  Comes back, see the clips.
[03:09:18.881 --> 03:09:21.982]  Again, I wrote about it in detail in my book, Trend Tracking.
[03:09:23.588 --> 03:09:28.468]   And he says when he gets out of the helicopter and all these guys dressed up in a military drag,
[03:09:28.468 --> 03:09:33.108]   you know, we have a great carpet, here comes the president, here comes the president.
[03:09:33.108 --> 03:09:42.788]   Hello, sir. Hello, sir. Carter says the Shah is the island of stability in the Middle East.
[03:09:42.788 --> 03:09:47.427]  The Bronx, we used to say BS has its own sound.
[03:09:50.068 --> 03:09:51.748]  No way you're gonna stop this.
[03:09:53.075 --> 03:09:53.755]  So what did I do?
[03:09:54.156 --> 03:09:57.117]  That's when I became a political atheist, didn't believe in the system anymore.
[03:09:57.137 --> 03:09:59.818]  I was a young guy, 32 years old.
[03:10:01.579 --> 03:10:03.881]  I started playing the futures markets, gold and oil.
[03:10:03.921 --> 03:10:10.124]  I said, you know, gold and oil prices are going to go up.
[03:10:10.284 --> 03:10:17.848]  I bet $5,000 in the futures market, both at $10,000, almost up to three quarters of a million dollars.
[03:10:19.368 --> 03:10:20.509]  And that's when I quit my job.
[03:10:21.789 --> 03:10:26.350]  I was a Chief Government Affairs Specialist at one time for the chemical industry.
[03:10:26.950 --> 03:10:32.992]  I was killing environmental legislation at the height of the environmental movement back in the 1970s.
[03:10:34.292 --> 03:10:36.313]  All I wanted to do was make money and have a good time.
[03:10:37.473 --> 03:10:38.373]  I started to grow up.
[03:10:38.933 --> 03:10:39.594]  It takes time.
[03:10:40.694 --> 03:10:42.094]  And it never stopped.
[03:10:42.134 --> 03:10:45.375]  You gotta keep learning and learning and learning and learning and learning and learning and learning.
[03:10:48.570 --> 03:10:54.235]  I lost a lot of the dough, you know, but I was enough and that's when I began trend forecasting.
[03:10:55.836 --> 03:10:58.799]  So now going back to Iran, what has Iran done to us?
[03:11:00.600 --> 03:11:02.562]  Oh, they had a nuclear deal that Trump killed.
[03:11:04.664 --> 03:11:04.844]  Yeah.
[03:11:08.127 --> 03:11:12.201]   And Trump took out that guy, Soleimani, that Vance Bragg's about.
[03:11:12.421 --> 03:11:13.301]  Totally against this.
[03:11:13.822 --> 03:11:15.423]  I launched Occupy Peace.
[03:11:15.903 --> 03:11:30.393]  I, all of these little boys, all these little boys that keep using Jesus Christ's name in vain by saying how religious you are, you're full of crap!
[03:11:31.634 --> 03:11:35.156]  Because I'm a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[03:11:35.937 --> 03:11:40.480]  You use Christ's name to keep the wars going.
[03:11:42.412 --> 03:11:50.859]  You make up this phony baloney stuff about what it says in, you know, Chapter 6, Section 8, or this or that, or what you believe in.
[03:11:52.240 --> 03:11:54.201]  Christ does not believe in murder.
[03:11:56.864 --> 03:12:00.767]  Christ would not believe in punching Iran hard.
[03:12:02.028 --> 03:12:03.829]  So what Christ you talking about?
[03:12:03.849 --> 03:12:11.035]  There's a lot of baloney.
[03:12:13.010 --> 03:12:14.971]  Again, that gentleman was just on.
[03:12:15.111 --> 03:12:18.173]  As I keep saying, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:12:21.535 --> 03:12:25.498]  When the magazine went out last week, I said, people call me a futurist.
[03:12:25.518 --> 03:12:26.358]  I'm not a futurist.
[03:12:26.398 --> 03:12:27.419]  Nobody can predict the future.
[03:12:27.439 --> 03:12:32.882]  There are too many wildcards, whether they're made by humans or nature.
[03:12:34.463 --> 03:12:39.026]  This election, you're going to see more wildcards being dealt.
[03:12:42.194 --> 03:12:45.976]  I personally believe that they try to get rid of Trump.
[03:12:47.836 --> 03:12:52.896]   Again, you're hearing more and more and more about all the other shots that were fired,
[03:12:52.896 --> 03:12:58.236]  and they won't show the facts about it.
[03:12:58.236 --> 03:13:06.036]  Oh, who killed JFK?
[03:13:06.006 --> 03:13:08.487]  It's a crime syndicate, it's not a government.
[03:13:09.968 --> 03:13:11.469]  So I launched Occupy Peace.
[03:13:12.776 --> 03:13:20.458]  And on September 28th, we want a million-person march to come up here to Kingston, New York.
[03:13:21.098 --> 03:13:22.799]  Go to OccupyPeace.com.
[03:13:23.939 --> 03:13:25.540]  Judge Napolitano will be here.
[03:13:26.220 --> 03:13:26.940]  Scott Ritter.
[03:13:27.980 --> 03:13:29.201]  Max Blumenthal.
[03:13:33.062 --> 03:13:35.482]  Anya Parampil.
[03:13:37.363 --> 03:13:37.903]  And others.
[03:13:39.604 --> 03:13:40.504]  We need peace.
[03:13:41.844 --> 03:13:44.725]  They are going to push us into war.
[03:13:48.506 --> 03:13:51.886]  To keep the Democrats in charge.
[03:13:53.547 --> 03:13:55.827]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:13:56.907 --> 03:14:03.269]  I read to you a hundred times, go to History Today, Franklin Roosevelt seizes Japanese assets.
[03:14:03.309 --> 03:14:03.569]  Yeah.
[03:14:04.338 --> 03:14:09.982]  Five months before they bomb Pearl Harbor, he takes all the Japanese assets, him, the UK, and the Dutch.
[03:14:10.322 --> 03:14:15.605]  They get together, cut off three quarters of Japanese trade, cut off 88% of their oil.
[03:14:16.526 --> 03:14:18.967]  Because they had the nerve to invade French Indochina.
[03:14:19.348 --> 03:14:25.171]  Oh yeah, our buddies the French are raping, robbing, pillaging Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.
[03:14:25.692 --> 03:14:27.032]  Can't let the Japanese do it.
[03:14:27.993 --> 03:14:29.194]  Stealing their oil and tin.
[03:14:31.575 --> 03:14:32.556]  What preceded that?
[03:14:34.022 --> 03:14:35.523]  Great depression.
[03:14:37.124 --> 03:14:40.507]  What preceded the dot-com, the war on terror?
[03:14:40.767 --> 03:14:41.888]  The dot-com bust.
[03:14:42.248 --> 03:14:43.309]  Everybody forgot about it.
[03:14:43.949 --> 03:14:45.891]  Oh, was the Nasdaq down like 70-something percent?
[03:14:45.911 --> 03:14:49.534]  We're going to get that guy Osama Bin Laden dead or alive!
[03:14:50.474 --> 03:14:51.075]  Yep, there we go.
[03:14:51.095 --> 03:14:52.596]  The U.S.
[03:14:52.636 --> 03:14:54.417]  frees its assets to the Japanese.
[03:14:54.677 --> 03:14:56.979]  You guys are doing a great job in Infowars.

[03:15:12.703 --> 03:15:19.748]  Misinformation is, if you don't swallow government crap, you don't like to swallow crap.
[03:15:19.788 --> 03:15:20.989]  You believe in misinformation.
[03:15:21.994 --> 03:15:26.238]  They're just a bunch of crap heads, and we've got to end it and make it free.

[03:18:47.548 --> 03:18:49.750]  I said about the disinformation campaign.
[03:18:50.290 --> 03:18:57.575]  Imagine, again, that was, again, this is, you know, I look at both sides, what they're going to do and how they're going to do it.
[03:18:58.576 --> 03:19:06.874]   And again, I agree with what Ron Paul wrote about if the Republicans get in there, you could They're going to lower taxes for the rich.
[03:19:07.854 --> 03:19:15.859]  Again, the Trump's tax cuts, he said that they were going to use the money for capital improvements.
[03:19:15.999 --> 03:19:16.379]  They didn't.
[03:19:16.419 --> 03:19:19.601]  The next year, stock buybacks hit a record level.
[03:19:19.701 --> 03:19:21.002]  They're only interested in themselves.
[03:19:22.363 --> 03:19:33.549]  But anyway, going back to what's going on and looking at the Democrats coming in, they're going to rob us more of our freedom of information.
[03:19:34.142 --> 03:19:36.103]  Absolutely, no question about it.
[03:19:37.223 --> 03:19:41.625]  And coming with this, they were going to put this, and that's the article.
[03:19:41.685 --> 03:19:41.865]  Yeah.
[03:19:43.005 --> 03:19:45.886]  Again, that's why you go to InfoWars, you get both sides.
[03:19:47.027 --> 03:19:48.027]  You get all sides.
[03:19:48.047 --> 03:19:49.448]  And that's what we do with the Trends Journal.
[03:19:49.468 --> 03:19:50.288]  We give you all sides.
[03:19:50.308 --> 03:19:52.989]  Again, here.
[03:19:53.009 --> 03:19:56.250]  Just to give you an example, one of the articles I had over here.
[03:19:57.031 --> 03:19:58.411]  Yeah.
[03:20:00.032 --> 03:20:03.433]  Could Josh Shapiro be America's first Jewish vice president?
[03:20:04.804 --> 03:20:05.484]  Where's that from?
[03:20:06.125 --> 03:20:11.608]  Oh, Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper, which we pay to get the information from.
[03:20:11.688 --> 03:20:12.308]  It's not free.
[03:20:13.169 --> 03:20:14.850]  But we want to know what everybody's saying.
[03:20:16.351 --> 03:20:21.754]  So going back to the misinformation, remember they were going to hide that clown lady under the Biden thing?
[03:20:23.374 --> 03:20:24.275]  Misinformation.
[03:20:25.336 --> 03:20:28.637]  She was really Miss M-I-S-S information.
[03:20:32.159 --> 03:20:33.020]  Again, it's been going on.
[03:20:34.423 --> 03:20:42.565]  We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.
[03:20:45.286 --> 03:20:46.606]  Is that Hitler or Mussolini?
[03:20:48.426 --> 03:20:54.248]  Oh, William J. Casey, CIA director, under Reagan.
[03:20:55.208 --> 03:20:56.748]  Yeah, William J., yeah, jerk.
[03:20:58.269 --> 03:20:59.829]  Off over there in Washington.
[03:21:01.650 --> 03:21:06.641]   So going back to this, Could Josh Shapiro be America's first Jewish Vice President?
[03:21:07.481 --> 03:21:15.104]  As I said, Trump made a mistake by, again, like Vance, I had nothing to do with it, by picking Vance.
[03:21:15.684 --> 03:21:19.145]  Because Trump won Ohio big in 2020.
[03:21:21.346 --> 03:21:22.667]  So Ohio, he's gonna win.
[03:21:22.687 --> 03:21:24.767]  You gotta win those swing states.
[03:21:25.828 --> 03:21:29.409]  He should have picked somebody from Wisconsin or Michigan.
[03:21:32.896 --> 03:21:33.997]  Or Pennsylvania.
[03:21:35.657 --> 03:21:37.678]  And that's where Josh Shapiro's from.
[03:21:38.719 --> 03:21:39.559]  Pennsylvania.
[03:21:42.860 --> 03:21:44.561]  It's all it's about the numbers.
[03:21:46.362 --> 03:21:49.063]  It's a numbers game and a money racket.
[03:21:50.904 --> 03:21:55.126]  Again, not my saying, you know, again, it's.
[03:21:56.446 --> 03:21:59.848]  One after another, one article after another about all the money.
[03:22:01.383 --> 03:22:04.044]  The billionaires are putting into this thing to run this show.
[03:22:04.084 --> 03:22:05.424]  They call this a democracy.
[03:22:05.844 --> 03:22:07.945]  You got no dough, you can't run for anything.
[03:22:08.885 --> 03:22:09.345]  Forget it.
[03:22:11.186 --> 03:22:11.666]  Forget it.
[03:22:13.467 --> 03:22:16.007]  You're a billions of dollar presidential campaign.
[03:22:19.529 --> 03:22:21.069]  Going back to the Kamala Harris.
[03:22:22.970 --> 03:22:27.171]  This guy they quote in this article from CNBC.
[03:22:30.032 --> 03:22:45.895]  Lou Lukens, senior partner of Signum Global Advisors, told CNBC Monday, quote, I'm not saying it's going to be easy for Kamala Harris, but I do think we have to give her the opportunity to be a candidate.
[03:22:46.255 --> 03:22:47.336]  Hey, cut zone.
[03:22:47.776 --> 03:22:50.336]  Why do you say we have to give her the opportunity?
[03:22:50.596 --> 03:22:51.816]  Oh, you're an analysis?
[03:22:53.237 --> 03:22:55.017]  And you're saying what we got to do?
[03:22:57.618 --> 03:22:58.898]  That's not analysis.
[03:22:59.554 --> 03:23:00.615]  That's BS!
[03:23:03.838 --> 03:23:04.018]  Yep.
[03:23:05.459 --> 03:23:08.661]  Goes on to say, Here's the difference, you ready?
[03:23:08.480 --> 03:23:12.681]   between Hamas and Biden's poll rating suggests that even if she was a Democratic president
[03:23:12.681 --> 03:23:15.880]   of this election, she'll need to convince voters she offers something different than
[03:23:15.880 --> 03:23:16.880]  Biden.
[03:23:16.880 --> 03:23:17.880]  Yeah.
[03:23:17.880 --> 03:23:19.840]  Here's the difference, you ready?
[03:23:19.840 --> 03:23:28.240]   Quote, as a woman, an African American, an Asian woman, she has attributes that will
[03:23:28.240 --> 03:23:31.240]  work in various kinds of constituencies.
[03:23:31.240 --> 03:23:41.239]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:23:34.419 --> 03:23:37.581]  What the hell do I care if you're an African American?
[03:23:40.162 --> 03:23:41.343]  Or an Asian woman?
[03:23:45.666 --> 03:23:52.390]  How about if I, could I give a damn what color, race, creed, gender you are?
[03:23:54.291 --> 03:23:55.852]  How about the best person?
[03:23:56.940 --> 03:23:58.281]  Screw you, Salenti!
[03:23:58.341 --> 03:24:01.004]  We're just going after the numbers, you got it?
[03:24:02.505 --> 03:24:04.968]  Oh, if only your women were in charge.
[03:24:05.648 --> 03:24:07.430]  How about that crap, huh?
[03:24:09.352 --> 03:24:11.754]  Little war-mongering, Hitler-y Clinton!
[03:24:12.675 --> 03:24:15.698]  Hey, how'd you feel when you found out Qaddafi was killed?
[03:24:17.179 --> 03:24:17.680]  We came?
[03:24:18.419 --> 03:24:19.160]  We sure?
[03:24:19.660 --> 03:24:20.341]  He died!
[03:24:20.361 --> 03:24:21.583]  Hee hee hee hee!
[03:24:22.163 --> 03:24:25.267]  Oh, how about that vandal lion little louse over there?
[03:24:25.607 --> 03:24:27.709]  And that bear buck over there in Europe?
[03:24:28.130 --> 03:24:29.011]  More war!
[03:24:29.071 --> 03:24:29.751]  More war!
[03:24:30.012 --> 03:24:33.475]  Oh, would it be proper to call the women war whores?
[03:24:34.496 --> 03:24:35.618]  I call the men war whores.
[03:24:38.180 --> 03:24:39.482]  What a bunch of crap!
[03:24:40.365 --> 03:24:44.428]  Oh, I forgot about Samantha Power and Susan Rice.
[03:24:45.048 --> 03:24:47.390]  How about Condoleezza Rice?
[03:24:48.011 --> 03:24:50.332]  That next mushroom cloud you see.
[03:24:50.913 --> 03:24:56.497]  Oh, yeah, the lady of love that sold and lied us into the Iraq War.
[03:24:56.997 --> 03:24:59.139]  If only women are in charge.
[03:24:59.659 --> 03:25:00.980]  Screw you!
[03:25:01.540 --> 03:25:02.621]  Oh, maybe Harris did that.
[03:25:02.641 --> 03:25:05.323]  I forgot what that guy she used to, well, yeah, yeah.
[03:25:05.603 --> 03:25:06.824]  Mayor of San Francisco, yeah.
[03:25:07.685 --> 03:25:09.186]  Good and bad comes in everything.
[03:25:09.895 --> 03:25:11.496]  Every race created in color.
[03:25:12.996 --> 03:25:14.377]  I am tired of this crap!
[03:25:18.659 --> 03:25:20.259]  What a bunch of garbage!
[03:25:21.480 --> 03:25:22.680]  But they're garbage men!
[03:25:22.700 --> 03:25:26.422]  They work for the mainstream media!
[03:25:26.442 --> 03:25:28.983]  What else they got here?
[03:25:29.003 --> 03:25:30.743]  Yeah, it's just garbage.
[03:25:31.284 --> 03:25:32.684]  Garbage, garbage everywhere.
[03:25:33.124 --> 03:25:34.645]  And not a drop to drink.
[03:25:35.365 --> 03:25:36.766]  Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
[03:25:36.786 --> 03:25:37.246]  Yep, crack, yep.
[03:25:38.928 --> 03:25:41.349]  So going back to the rich in charge, you ready?
[03:25:41.369 --> 03:25:45.870]  This came out from the World Socialist website.
[03:25:45.890 --> 03:25:47.410]  Again, we read everything.
[03:25:48.130 --> 03:25:51.291]  We go to ISNA, IRNA, Tehran Times.
[03:25:51.331 --> 03:25:52.631]  I want to hear what the Iranians have to say.
[03:25:52.651 --> 03:25:54.492]  I want to hear what Al Jazeera has to say.
[03:25:54.872 --> 03:26:00.193]  I want to hear what the lefty of the leftist left's World Socialist website has to say.
[03:26:00.213 --> 03:26:07.275]  Because they put out information that you take what you think is valuable in terms of data.
[03:26:09.631 --> 03:26:10.372]  That's all you do.
[03:26:11.472 --> 03:26:19.577]  I read, yeah, this is like just a couple, every day I got to read this stuff, underline all the salient points of these stories.
[03:26:20.198 --> 03:26:20.418]  Yeah.
[03:26:21.659 --> 03:26:22.859]  Day after day after day.
[03:26:24.400 --> 03:26:34.066]  But going back to World Socialist website, Global Wealth Report, an orgy of enrichment for the super rich.
[03:26:34.904 --> 03:26:47.294]  Multi-millionaires around the world have benefited from the inflation year 2023, while the German super-rich alone increased their wealth by 10% to more than $2.1 trillion.
[03:26:49.316 --> 03:26:54.540]  The global wealth produced by the international working class is concentrated, you ready?
[03:26:55.220 --> 03:26:59.864]  In the hands of 73,000 super-rich people.
[03:27:00.985 --> 03:27:05.987]   The so-called, quote, Ultra-rich net worth individuals.
[03:27:09.270 --> 03:27:19.977]  The net wealth of the ruling class in all nation states rose by more than 4% to over $400 trillion in 2023.
[03:27:20.317 --> 03:27:20.758]  Yep.
[03:27:23.960 --> 03:27:27.062]  As the Global Wealth Report reveals.
[03:27:30.084 --> 03:27:40.666]   Worldwide financial assets, cash, Account balances, bonds, shares, investment funds, as well as pensions, rose by 7% to $231 trillion.
[03:27:40.686 --> 03:27:41.527]  But it goes on and on.
[03:27:42.287 --> 03:27:42.467]  Yeah.
[03:27:43.668 --> 03:27:44.888]  Go back to the election.
[03:27:45.809 --> 03:27:55.453]  Read the article, after article, after article, after article, after article, after article, of all the billionaires, multimillionaires running the show in America.
[03:27:55.933 --> 03:27:56.413]  You got it.
[03:27:56.894 --> 03:27:57.334]  You got it.
[03:27:57.354 --> 03:28:01.936]  It's a crime syndicate.
[03:28:03.922 --> 03:28:04.602]  They own us!
[03:28:06.144 --> 03:28:09.446]  We're nothing more than plantation workers of Slavelandia.
[03:28:12.928 --> 03:28:14.029]  Everything's backwards.
[03:28:17.870 --> 03:28:21.709]  Yep, yeah, everything backwards.
[03:28:21.709 --> 03:28:23.110]  This is from Euronews, you ready?
[03:28:23.110 --> 03:28:31.430]  Far-right MEPs voted mass against pro-Ukraine resolution.
[03:28:31.430 --> 03:28:36.549]   The far-right in European Parliament made its voice heard on Wednesday
[03:28:36.549 --> 03:28:42.709]   by unsuccessfully attempting to block the 10th legislature's first resolution,
[03:28:42.709 --> 03:28:44.990]  which doubled down on support for Ukraine.
[03:28:46.430 --> 03:28:50.549]  And denounced Viktor Orban's controversial peace tour.
[03:28:50.549 --> 03:28:55.470]   Viktor Orban is the President, the Prime Minister of Hungary.
[03:28:55.470 --> 03:28:59.070]   And he went to visit Putin to try to get a peace deal together.
[03:28:59.070 --> 03:29:07.629]   They condemned the far-right MPs, the not wanting to increase the Ukraine war, there it is.
[03:29:07.629 --> 03:29:14.750]   And condemning, condemning Orban's quote, controversial peace tour.
[03:29:14.750 --> 03:29:24.750]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:29:15.871 --> 03:29:17.211]  Peace is controversial.
[03:29:17.231 --> 03:29:17.672]  You know why?
[03:29:18.132 --> 03:29:20.553]  Because they're pieces of crap, these people.
[03:29:20.933 --> 03:29:22.613]  They're little prostitutes.
[03:29:22.973 --> 03:29:30.616]  They're little gutless boys, girls that put out for their corporate pimps and government whoremasters to keep selling war.
[03:29:31.056 --> 03:29:33.057]  War after war after war.
[03:29:33.397 --> 03:29:34.137]  War whores.
[03:29:35.078 --> 03:29:39.619]  So, going back, far right, huh?
[03:29:40.519 --> 03:29:46.747]   Once upon a time when I was a young man, they called him Far left.
[03:29:47.848 --> 03:29:48.288]  That's right.
[03:29:50.268 --> 03:29:53.350]  The left used to be against the wars.
[03:29:54.510 --> 03:29:54.970]  No more.
[03:29:55.950 --> 03:29:56.411]  No more.
[03:29:57.831 --> 03:30:09.955]  And all these little scum, all these little arrogant boys and girls who want to keep stealing our rights away from us.
[03:30:13.997 --> 03:30:18.273]   On the other side, The right wing calls them liberals.
[03:30:19.214 --> 03:30:19.914]  They're not liberals.
[03:30:21.715 --> 03:30:22.616]  These aren't liberals.
[03:30:23.477 --> 03:30:24.938]  Here's the definition for a liberal.
[03:30:26.098 --> 03:30:32.803]  Willing to respect or accept behavior or opinions different from one's own.
[03:30:33.524 --> 03:30:35.205]  Open to new ideas.
[03:30:37.586 --> 03:30:42.530]  Again, now they call Libtards liberals.
[03:30:43.390 --> 03:30:44.230]  They're libtards.
[03:30:44.510 --> 03:30:45.251]  They're not liberals.
[03:30:45.891 --> 03:30:49.552]  And now, when you're for peace, you're not the far left.
[03:30:49.972 --> 03:30:50.912]  You're the far right.
[03:30:51.352 --> 03:30:59.875]  I mention this to show how screwed up everything is because we have a bunch of screwballs running this show.
[03:30:59.895 --> 03:31:03.296]  A freak show.
[03:31:04.737 --> 03:31:05.057]  So.
[03:31:07.918 --> 03:31:08.278]  Article.
[03:31:11.399 --> 03:31:14.996]   Wednesday's Wall Street Journal.
[03:31:15.556 --> 03:31:16.596]  Wall S.H.I.
[03:31:16.636 --> 03:31:16.996]  Journal.
[03:31:17.697 --> 03:31:20.898]  Commercial Real Estate Meltdown Strange Debt Deals.
[03:31:21.258 --> 03:31:21.758]  A meltdown?
[03:31:24.179 --> 03:31:24.359]  Yep.
[03:31:25.580 --> 03:31:28.061]  They don't really call it a meltdown, but don't talk about it.
[03:31:28.101 --> 03:31:36.544]  The faults are mounting in the favorite Wall Street mortgage investment, setting off fresh alarms about the future of offices and malls and cities.
[03:31:36.363 --> 03:31:51.523]  Isn't that a nice language?
[03:31:52.208 --> 03:31:55.569]  Some properties are hanging on but struggling to attract tenants.
[03:31:57.169 --> 03:32:03.370]  Pushing the price to their lower rate bonds below 20 cents on the dollar.
[03:32:04.211 --> 03:32:04.711]  That's right.
[03:32:06.251 --> 03:32:07.291]  20 cents on the dollar.
[03:32:08.412 --> 03:32:21.924]   We are the only magazine That has reported forecasting the office building bust when they've locked down things in 2020.
[03:32:24.545 --> 03:32:27.546]  May of 2020, we call the office building bust.
[03:32:29.226 --> 03:32:30.707]  It's going to be a bank scope bust.
[03:32:31.067 --> 03:32:32.027]  Again, go back.
[03:32:32.687 --> 03:32:35.148]  In trend forecasting, all things are connected.
[03:32:36.228 --> 03:32:39.889]  Whereas Chief Seattle said all things are connected like the blood which unites us all.
[03:32:41.385 --> 03:32:44.348]  So now you've got to go back and look at this.
[03:32:44.589 --> 03:32:48.113]  Look at the consequences of empty offices.
[03:32:49.235 --> 03:32:52.937]  You're looking at the office vacancy rate, meaning nobody in there.
[03:32:53.477 --> 03:32:56.558]  Brought to you by Katzon Gavin Newsom, little gruesome Newsom.
[03:32:56.578 --> 03:32:58.259]  My daddy worked for the Giddy Gang.
[03:32:58.619 --> 03:32:59.719]  I'm a spoiled little boy.
[03:32:59.759 --> 03:33:02.320]  The Giddy Gang gave me all that money to start my businesses.
[03:33:02.860 --> 03:33:03.261]  Oh, yeah.
[03:33:03.361 --> 03:33:03.741]  Oh, yeah.
[03:33:03.781 --> 03:33:04.321]  I got there.
[03:33:04.361 --> 03:33:05.001]  Member of the club.
[03:33:05.041 --> 03:33:06.282]  Oh, related to Pelosi.
[03:33:06.302 --> 03:33:06.482]  Yeah.
[03:33:06.702 --> 03:33:06.842]  Yeah.
[03:33:06.862 --> 03:33:07.242]  That guy.
[03:33:07.282 --> 03:33:07.462]  Right.
[03:33:07.883 --> 03:33:09.543]  Closed down California.
[03:33:10.003 --> 03:33:12.484]  Vacancy rate in San Francisco.
[03:33:12.504 --> 03:33:15.045]  34.5 percent.
[03:33:15.245 --> 03:33:15.686]  Vacant.
[03:33:16.926 --> 03:33:17.686]  Nobody there.
[03:33:18.727 --> 03:33:18.907]  Empty.
[03:33:20.396 --> 03:33:21.976]  You know what it was before the COVID war?
[03:33:22.717 --> 03:33:26.798]  Vacancy rate, 35% now, 5% before.
[03:33:27.678 --> 03:33:30.939]  New York City, 23% vacancy rate.
[03:33:31.939 --> 03:33:34.440]  The office occupancy rate, Google it up.
[03:33:35.780 --> 03:33:40.581]  Castle Systems with a K. I couldn't believe it, it was down to like 40-something percent.
[03:33:44.963 --> 03:33:46.603]  Occupancy rate, okay.
[03:33:47.702 --> 03:33:52.244]  How are they going to pay the loans off on the buildings?
[03:33:53.004 --> 03:33:53.505]  They're not.
[03:33:54.325 --> 03:33:55.125]  They're going to default.
[03:33:55.165 --> 03:33:56.686]  The bonds are only one part of it.
[03:33:57.947 --> 03:34:00.068]  How are the banks going to cover the losses?
[03:34:00.908 --> 03:34:01.348]  They're not.
[03:34:02.269 --> 03:34:05.990]  Go back, again, all things are connected to the Ron Paul article.
[03:34:06.991 --> 03:34:13.814]  And he mentions in there the trillions of dollars that the Trump administration threw in to fight the COVID war.
[03:34:14.594 --> 03:34:16.515]  How they brought interest rates down to zero.
[03:34:18.524 --> 03:34:20.645]  And people started dumping money into the banks.
[03:34:20.665 --> 03:34:21.526]  You got all this dough.
[03:34:21.546 --> 03:34:22.146]  You're not working.
[03:34:22.166 --> 03:34:22.766]  Here's free money.
[03:34:22.986 --> 03:34:23.907]  Here, stay home.
[03:34:25.407 --> 03:34:26.328]  What'd they do with that money?
[03:34:28.589 --> 03:34:29.469]  They bought treasuries.
[03:34:30.830 --> 03:34:35.372]  You mean they bought treasuries when interest rates are at zero?
[03:34:36.413 --> 03:34:36.893]  The banks?
[03:34:38.494 --> 03:34:39.915]  How are they going to cover their losses?
[03:34:44.037 --> 03:34:45.497]  How are they going to cover their defaults?
[03:34:45.938 --> 03:34:46.378]  They're not.
[03:34:47.648 --> 03:34:48.108]  They're not.
[03:34:48.669 --> 03:34:50.170]  Now let's go back to the election.
[03:34:51.811 --> 03:34:53.753]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:34:56.936 --> 03:34:57.956]  The markets are going to fail.
[03:34:57.977 --> 03:34:59.198]  You saw what happened last week.
[03:35:00.839 --> 03:35:03.521]  You saw how the Nasdaq was tumbling down.
[03:35:06.063 --> 03:35:11.728]  And by the way, again, three companies own 88% of all the S&P 500.
[03:35:12.628 --> 03:35:15.511]  Vanguard, BlackRock, and States.
[03:35:16.991 --> 03:35:17.611]  Three companies.
[03:35:18.672 --> 03:35:22.674]  Goes back to that article about the billionaires, trillionaires own the world.
[03:35:22.694 --> 03:35:27.317]  It's right there.
[03:35:28.578 --> 03:35:28.778]  Yep.
[03:35:32.000 --> 03:35:36.322]  So, you go back to last week and you saw the markets shaking.
[03:35:40.425 --> 03:35:45.768]  The party in power is going to stay in power, or it's going to try to stay in power, do everything they can.
[03:35:48.817 --> 03:35:54.580]  Dwight D. Eisenhower, five-star general, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in World War II.
[03:35:54.600 --> 03:35:57.782]  And again, people say, oh, you say these nice things about Eisenhower.
[03:35:57.822 --> 03:35:58.643]  He did crummy things.
[03:35:58.723 --> 03:35:58.983]  I did.
[03:35:59.083 --> 03:36:01.264]  I pull my own crap in my life, too.
[03:36:02.185 --> 03:36:04.926]  You grow up and you, you know, oh, I was perfect.
[03:36:05.226 --> 03:36:06.527]  I was a perfect little boy.
[03:36:06.767 --> 03:36:08.308]  I never got out of kindergarten.
[03:36:08.628 --> 03:36:09.549]  Save your crap.
[03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:11.810]  Eisenhower hated war.
[03:36:12.390 --> 03:36:14.451]  He saw murderous wars and hated them.
[03:36:16.232 --> 03:36:17.013]  And he warned.
[03:36:18.402 --> 03:36:20.083]  Again, he didn't want to run for President.
[03:36:20.123 --> 03:36:22.805]  He was like President of Columbia University and he talked him into it.
[03:36:23.766 --> 03:36:32.832]  Any man seeking the office of President, he said, you could Google this up, is either an egomaniac or crazy.
[03:36:35.834 --> 03:36:39.436]  You got a bunch of egomaniacs and crazy people in politics.
[03:36:40.937 --> 03:36:41.958]  End of story.
[03:36:42.538 --> 03:36:46.040]  They're going to do everything they can to stay in office.
[03:36:46.100 --> 03:36:48.732]   Now, very important, Very important.
[03:36:50.214 --> 03:36:51.394]  Again, all of a sudden.
[03:36:52.935 --> 03:36:55.497]  Oh, it's a fact that Trump is a Trump Biden.
[03:36:56.398 --> 03:36:57.919]  Greenberg, Eisberg, what's the difference?
[03:36:58.019 --> 03:37:00.281]  Anyway, that binds out of his mind.
[03:37:00.701 --> 03:37:03.863]  I mean, everybody saw it for years, for years.
[03:37:04.363 --> 03:37:05.624]  All of a sudden he announces it.
[03:37:07.405 --> 03:37:09.847]  Let's go back before Sunday when he announced it.
[03:37:10.147 --> 03:37:11.028]  What was all the news?
[03:37:12.349 --> 03:37:14.230]  All the news was about Trump.
[03:37:15.551 --> 03:37:20.606]   All the news is about Vance, who changed his name twice.
[03:37:23.987 --> 03:37:27.847]  That was the news and very positive, very positive.
[03:37:28.868 --> 03:37:35.089]  No way, no how, it'll look like the Democrats could beat them.
[03:37:36.750 --> 03:37:37.450]  What did they do?
[03:37:38.310 --> 03:37:50.484]   They waited until after the Republican convention and then announced That Biden not running.
[03:37:55.307 --> 03:37:56.207]  That's the news.
[03:37:57.268 --> 03:38:02.130]  Now the flow of news and support has shifted.
[03:38:04.631 --> 03:38:05.612]  They know what they're doing.
[03:38:09.453 --> 03:38:11.434]  Is Kamala Harris the best person?
[03:38:11.474 --> 03:38:13.275]  You know, I don't know.
[03:38:14.536 --> 03:38:14.916]  The end.
[03:38:14.936 --> 03:38:16.757]  Yeah, the end was a long time ago.
[03:38:18.127 --> 03:38:18.527]  The end.
[03:38:19.308 --> 03:38:22.709]  Again, how come this clown is still the president?
[03:38:24.790 --> 03:38:28.192]  Maybe he's gonna make Kamala Harris the president.
[03:38:28.212 --> 03:38:28.972]  He's gonna retire.
[03:38:29.673 --> 03:38:30.913]  And then she'll be running as president.
[03:38:30.933 --> 03:38:31.954]  Becomes a whole different show.
[03:38:33.975 --> 03:38:35.455]  It's a crime syndicate.
[03:38:36.196 --> 03:38:37.636]  They don't represent us.
[03:38:37.716 --> 03:38:39.637]  They represent the people that pay them off.
[03:38:40.458 --> 03:38:40.938]  Look at them.
[03:38:42.219 --> 03:38:45.780]  Hundreds of millions of dollars these people are giving to the candidates.
[03:38:46.781 --> 03:38:49.444]   You don't think You don't think they're getting anything back for that?
[03:38:50.165 --> 03:38:58.951]  Hey, all of you billionaires and multi-millionaires, how about a couple of hundred million dollars for Occupy Peace?
[03:38:59.812 --> 03:39:07.377]  If the billionaires gave a billion dollars for peace, we'd have peace tomorrow.
[03:39:07.758 --> 03:39:10.059]  But you're just pieces of crap!
[03:39:10.440 --> 03:39:14.843]  You're just little money junkies with peckers like that!
[03:39:15.632 --> 03:39:18.553]  Money junkie little billionaires!
[03:39:19.053 --> 03:39:20.654]  Robbers and thieves!
[03:39:21.154 --> 03:39:22.674]  We own everything!
[03:39:23.035 --> 03:39:25.555]  And we'll steal all that we can get!
[03:39:26.216 --> 03:39:28.496]  And we own everybody!
[03:39:31.317 --> 03:39:35.379]  We did away with all the laws that made America the land of opportunity!
[03:39:35.859 --> 03:39:37.720]  So we can own it all!
[03:39:38.040 --> 03:39:39.320]  We're the vanguards!
[03:39:39.380 --> 03:39:40.721]  We're the Black Rocks!
[03:39:44.082 --> 03:39:44.322]  Yeah.
[03:39:45.748 --> 03:39:47.849]  Disgusting what's happened to this country!
[03:39:48.770 --> 03:39:49.651]  Disgusting!
[03:39:51.272 --> 03:39:53.593]  Where are the billionaires for peace?
[03:39:54.394 --> 03:39:56.776]  You got big mouths, where are you?
[03:39:58.637 --> 03:40:00.098]  You're pieces of crap!
[03:40:01.119 --> 03:40:02.039]  Not a penny!
[03:40:02.380 --> 03:40:04.821]  Not one damn penny for peace!
[03:40:06.522 --> 03:40:09.024]  So, be here, September 28th.
[03:40:10.569 --> 03:40:16.693]  The four corners of freedom, the most historic four corners in America, where the seeds of democracy was sown.
[03:40:17.193 --> 03:40:18.394]  John and Crown Street.
[03:40:18.754 --> 03:40:21.276]  Go to Occupy Peace, get more information.
[03:40:21.836 --> 03:40:27.720]  Judge Napolitano, Scott Ritter, Max Blumenthal, Anya Parampil, and others.
[03:40:29.721 --> 03:40:31.182]  We must unite for peace.
[03:40:31.542 --> 03:40:33.103]  They're going to take us to war.
[03:40:33.383 --> 03:40:35.324]  When all else fails, they take us to war.
[03:40:36.105 --> 03:40:37.085]  And watch the markets.
[03:40:37.406 --> 03:40:37.926]  And gold?
[03:40:39.076 --> 03:40:41.157]  When Harris gets in, if she gets in, whoo!
[03:40:42.538 --> 03:40:43.639]  Watch gold rise.
[03:40:44.159 --> 03:40:57.147]  Explain how the central bank digital currency, ESG controlled corporate governance, controlling what you can do and spend in corporations, governments, private individuals, how they use that as the next bubble with a unified ledger.
[03:40:57.207 --> 03:41:14.007]   This is key because their bridge to get out of this bubble is the next level of total control to take a giant slice of everybody's life, but not call it a bail-in, just call it a Social credit score. Yeah, so let me if I may put this into
[03:41:14.007 --> 03:41:19.927]   the context of you and what you've gone through in this bankruptcy that you've had to go through
[03:41:19.927 --> 03:41:22.166]  and everything happening with Infowars.
[03:41:22.166 --> 03:41:27.686]   You know, they didn't like what you had to say so they froze you from your bank accounts. You
[03:41:27.686 --> 03:41:34.326]   couldn't access your money, right? So that but that took a legal process to get to that point.
[03:41:34.478 --> 03:41:37.439]  This is that exact same scenario.
[03:41:38.099 --> 03:41:41.481]  Them separating you from your money, but without a legal process.
[03:41:42.061 --> 03:41:43.602]  They can just do it because they don't like you.
[03:41:44.022 --> 03:41:45.502]  Because they don't like your ideology.
[03:41:45.522 --> 03:41:45.983]  Now slow down.
[03:41:46.023 --> 03:41:47.063]  That's the key, Dr. Elliott.
[03:41:47.303 --> 03:41:49.424]  This is a central bank ledger.
[03:41:49.444 --> 03:41:50.665]  Just sounds like a term people know of.
[03:41:50.785 --> 03:41:51.965]  Everyone is in bankruptcy.
[03:41:52.005 --> 03:41:54.506]  Private companies, corporations, the general public.
[03:41:54.526 --> 03:41:54.927]  That's what they say.
[03:41:54.947 --> 03:41:55.847]  They'll owe nothing and like it.
[03:41:56.207 --> 03:41:58.028]  And then they unify it and take what they want.
[03:41:58.308 --> 03:41:59.088]  Your mortgage.
[03:41:59.268 --> 03:42:00.189]  Everything is unified.
[03:42:00.629 --> 03:42:01.050]  Everything!
[03:42:01.410 --> 03:42:14.850]  See, every asset that you have that's in this digital form, whether it's a bank account, checking account, savings account, money market, stock bond, mutual fund, brokerage account, all of that stuff, and anything with a title like your house, right?
[03:42:14.890 --> 03:42:34.596]   You can be put into this unified ledger Now, the World Economic Forum has explained this really well in the sense of this is digital money, it's programmable money, meaning they tokenize or they put all of your assets into a packet and that packet is now can be sold, right?
[03:42:34.616 --> 03:42:35.736]  This is like a derivative.
[03:42:36.116 --> 03:42:43.197]  You can flip off the ownership with the flip of a button saying, okay, Alex, you no longer own all of this stuff that you thought you had.
[03:42:43.478 --> 03:42:49.800]   We're flipping the switch and we're going to give it to Person B, or person C, or to the government, right?
[03:42:49.820 --> 03:42:50.840]  They can do whatever they want.
[03:42:50.920 --> 03:42:54.422]  This is what programmable money and a unified ledger is.
[03:42:54.562 --> 03:43:01.565]  And to make it really dangerous is that it's based on your digital social profile and your social credit score.
[03:43:02.006 --> 03:43:05.847]  Now, we, you know, we're not talking about a dystopian future, right?
[03:43:06.168 --> 03:43:08.909]  We saw this happen with the truckers in Canada.
[03:43:09.449 --> 03:43:11.854]  They, their ideology, they're what they were.
[03:43:11.875 --> 03:43:16.565]  Oh, the British Prime Minister said if you don't accept military service, we'll just turn your bank account off.
[03:43:16.925 --> 03:43:17.727]  That, two weeks ago.
[03:43:18.840 --> 03:43:20.241]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:43:20.741 --> 03:43:25.384]  So, so all of these things seem to be a stretch in people's minds, right?
[03:43:25.404 --> 03:43:27.166]  It's like, oh, this is the Mark of the Beast.
[03:43:27.186 --> 03:43:28.086]  This is way down the road.
[03:43:28.426 --> 03:43:29.807]  We've seen it, you know, bank accounts.
[03:43:29.827 --> 03:43:30.128]  That's right.
[03:43:30.148 --> 03:43:32.149]  You're not covering things that are coming.
[03:43:32.249 --> 03:43:33.450]  This is all being rolled out now.
[03:43:33.910 --> 03:43:40.635]  They have gas station chains all over Europe, the U.S., putting in Oklahoma and Texas, where you've got to swipe a card to get in the building.
[03:43:40.655 --> 03:43:44.337]  You've got to swipe a card to buy gas just to prove you're even able to buy it.
[03:43:44.477 --> 03:43:46.939]  I mean, it's coming in.
[03:43:47.079 --> 03:43:49.901]   We're not just talking about Freedom here, right?
[03:43:49.961 --> 03:43:53.125]  Financial freedom, getting out of harm's way of these digital assets.
[03:43:53.145 --> 03:43:56.869]  We're also doing something that we get the best of both worlds.
[03:43:57.309 --> 03:43:59.111]  Asset protection and growth.
[03:43:59.652 --> 03:44:03.556]  And that's what makes it such an amazing concept right now.
[03:44:03.696 --> 03:44:05.057]  Nothing is performed as good as silver.
[03:44:05.718 --> 03:44:10.621]  And I haven't had a silver or gold sponsor because so many of them sell numismatics, rip people off.
[03:44:10.681 --> 03:44:14.863]  You are the number one bullion dealer in America right now because you've got the best deals.
[03:44:14.883 --> 03:44:16.644]  Look at that 12-year graph, folks.
[03:44:17.184 --> 03:44:20.326]  This is a no-brainer to protect your assets and probably have growth.
[03:44:20.646 --> 03:44:25.308]  We can't guarantee anything, but my God, you're crazy if you don't call Dr. Kirk Elliott at 720-605-3900.
