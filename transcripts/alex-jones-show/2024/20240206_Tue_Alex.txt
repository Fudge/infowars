[00:00:01.138 --> 00:00:06.926]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[00:00:12.647 --> 00:00:31.047]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.045 --> 00:00:33.045]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:50.045]  Things are getting stranger by the day.
[00:00:50.053 --> 00:00:54.935]  Just a coincidence, or is something more sinister happening right under our noses?
[00:00:55.515 --> 00:00:58.176]  We want to warn you now, this next story is disturbing.
[00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:09.823]  Namely in earlier times, it was easier to control a million people, literally, than physically to kill a million people.
[00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:17.972]  Today, it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people.
[00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.094]  It is easier to kill than to control.
[00:01:20.114 --> 00:01:26.621]   I would like to Reduce the number of people on the planet because there's too many of us.
[00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:30.885]  It's a planet of finite resources and we're using them up.
[00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:34.929]  First we've got population.
[00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:37.031]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:46.319]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[00:01:47.694 --> 00:01:50.297]  The true ruling elite are a death cult.
[00:01:50.937 --> 00:01:51.698]  Pure evil.
[00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:54.401]  The elite are extremely wealthy.
[00:01:54.902 --> 00:01:57.064]  They have more money than you can think of.
[00:01:57.965 --> 00:02:01.709]  So why would they want even more money, even more control?
[00:02:03.795 --> 00:02:07.897]  It's because they use their wealth and power to execute their agenda.
[00:02:08.518 --> 00:02:09.758]  To live out their evil.
[00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.101]  If you think this is just conspiracy theory, think again.
[00:02:14.741 --> 00:02:15.622]  Look around you.
[00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:19.564]  Everything benefits them, and not humanity.
[00:02:19.904 --> 00:02:21.705]  The globalists have a religion.
[00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:26.348]  To the public it's sold as climate change or the global crisis.
[00:02:27.288 --> 00:02:29.749]  What is the basis of the climate change agenda?
[00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:31.970]  It's population control.
[00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.911]  It's depopulation.
[00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:38.793]  The elite look at us as parasites that need to be controlled and killed.
[00:02:40.194 --> 00:02:43.975]  There is an unelected network that controls what the public sees.
[00:02:45.156 --> 00:02:47.477]  Plausible deniability is their cover.
[00:02:47.937 --> 00:02:50.758]  They are playing dumb on every level to gaslight us.
[00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.993]  The same agendas throughout history are presented differently with the same goals.
[00:02:57.754 --> 00:03:02.518]  The elite are becoming restless and are now out in the open with who they really are.
[00:03:03.038 --> 00:03:06.641]  Corruption in the government is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:03:07.402 --> 00:03:10.645]  The upper echelon at the top have an anti-human agenda.
[00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.071]  Threats of world war.
[00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:20.113]  But behind the scene, it's more about control and backdoor dealings between world governments.
[00:03:20.774 --> 00:03:27.537]  The open border, drug trafficking, human trafficking is covered up and controlled by our own government.
[00:03:28.117 --> 00:03:29.098]  It's deeper than that.
[00:03:30.318 --> 00:03:34.480]  There is a reason why most of these corruption networks never get shut down.
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.242]  These anti-humanists control mostly everything.
[00:03:40.441 --> 00:03:45.886]  You'd be shocked to know what the people in most power positions really think of the general public.
[00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:53.092]  The elite's corruption network operates like prison gangs, or like a mafia, but on a larger scale.
[00:03:53.772 --> 00:03:54.453]  Blackmail.
[00:03:54.973 --> 00:03:55.674]  Controllers.
[00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:56.735]  Handlers.
[00:03:57.415 --> 00:03:58.196]  Money laundering.
[00:03:58.997 --> 00:04:03.180]  If you want to stay rich and powerful, you'll have to do their dirty work.
[00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:05.522]  They have their hands in everything.
[00:04:06.543 --> 00:04:09.444]  A lot of these players simply love the spotlight.
[00:04:10.184 --> 00:04:15.205]  Most of the celebrities, politicians, CEOs love the fame and fortune.
[00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:19.326]  But the ones at the top of these groups are completely evil.
[00:04:20.246 --> 00:04:27.167]  Many become unwillingly controlled by signing on into the club without knowing what they are actually involved with behind the scenes.
[00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:31.908]  Most of humanity is asleep and distracted by meaninglessness.
[00:04:33.342 --> 00:04:38.575]  The elite are warning us of a cyber attack, also known as a digital 9-11 event.
[00:04:39.156 --> 00:04:42.545]  The economy would collapse if we suffered an internet shutdown.
[00:04:44.676 --> 00:04:48.457]  The modern power grid relies on the internet to coordinate power plants.
[00:04:49.237 --> 00:04:57.559]  Without it, each country's national grid will become unbalanced, and local outages escalate into a blackout for most of the world.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.541]  A society slipping into chaos will allow the elite to reset and rebuild a world for themselves.
[00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:08.002]  There will be events leading up to a total collapse.
[00:05:08.502 --> 00:05:13.184]   Domestic terror attacks, biological attacks, World Wars.
[00:05:13.504 --> 00:05:16.606]  With each event, more and more control is gained.
[00:05:17.507 --> 00:05:18.688]  Time is running out.
[00:05:19.548 --> 00:05:24.732]  If society suffers from any of these trigger events, there might be no turning back.
[00:05:25.272 --> 00:05:27.093]  Humanity is at the crossroads.
[00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:29.515]  This is happening right now.
[00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.592]  We need to reject the global agenda, and know who the world rulers really are and what they are up to.
[00:05:38.232 --> 00:05:40.393]  The fight for humanity is happening.
[00:05:41.513 --> 00:05:41.833]  Now.
[00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:50.356]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:05:51.096 --> 00:05:53.657]  InfoWars.com forward slash go.
[00:05:53.717 --> 00:05:54.877]  Any botherance, die.
[00:05:57.736 --> 00:06:01.979]  You can see here the Great Awakening orbiting the Great Reset.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:12.447]  Although the depopulation systems of the Great Reset are not yet fully operational, the Great Reset does have a strong conspiracy network.
[00:06:12.887 --> 00:06:18.771]  It is protected by a satanic shield, which can be disabled by the Great Awakening.
[00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:25.396]  The Great Reset must be deactivated if any victory for humanity is to be accomplished.
[00:06:26.425 --> 00:06:40.478]  Once the Great Awakening deactivates the shield, InfoWars.com forward slash show will cover the truth while Info Warriors fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the Great Reset.
[00:06:40.978 --> 00:06:44.721]  Alex Jones has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.
[00:06:45.062 --> 00:06:50.487]  Get a signed copy of the Great Awakening today at InfoWarsStore.com!
[00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:59.435]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, February 6th, 2024.
[00:07:01.076 --> 00:07:07.058]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm going to be hosting the full four hours today.
[00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:11.180]  We have three guests in studio.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:21.053]   Before I tell you about that, Oh, I come in almost every broadcast and say this is the most insane show yet because everything is quickening.
[00:07:21.433 --> 00:07:22.554]  You don't need me to tell you that.
[00:07:22.614 --> 00:07:23.794]  It's not an exaggeration.
[00:07:24.955 --> 00:07:25.275]  Wow!
[00:07:25.355 --> 00:07:31.399]  Well, Tucker Carlson has gotten the Putin interview and he's not done yet.
[00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:37.643]  He's going to spend two more weeks in Europe with other amazing things he's up to.
[00:07:39.358 --> 00:07:47.280]  And I'll leave it at that, but I do have some interesting things that I have to say about it.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:08:03.724]  And I just shot a report about 30 minutes before we went live that Rob Dew is finishing up with some B-roll that we'll have in about 15 minutes that I think says it succinctly, and I nailed it, and also breaks some pretty big news.
[00:08:04.524 --> 00:08:06.685]  And so we're going to table that.
[00:08:08.576 --> 00:08:12.499]  Until that report is ready and it will speak for itself.
[00:08:16.241 --> 00:08:23.206]  I've just posted on X, seconds before I went live, a headline we'll put on screen for you.
[00:08:23.927 --> 00:08:26.408]  Tucker Carlson tries to stop World War III.
[00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:34.154]  Bravely travels to Russia to get the Vladimir Putin historic interview.
[00:08:35.993 --> 00:08:48.841]  We need a Kennedy today, like we had in 1961-62 with the Cuban Missile Crisis, who would get on the telephone with Nikita Khrushchev, who came within minutes of nuclear war.
[00:08:50.782 --> 00:09:11.701]   Today, we have globalists that have completely cut off communications with Russia and are doing giant NATO war games of attacking Russia and build very respected and the biggest publication, the mouth of NATO, said Poland is preparing for war and believes they're about to have a war with Russia.
[00:09:12.502 --> 00:09:14.823]  The Swedish defense minister a month ago said that.
[00:09:14.863 --> 00:09:17.065]  The British defense minister two weeks ago said that.
[00:09:18.246 --> 00:09:23.410]  NATO has said that Russia is not going to invade any other countries.
[00:09:24.321 --> 00:09:36.830]  Russia for nine years said, if you keep running a proxy war against us in Ukraine and kicking the Russians out, where we've been since the founding of Russia a thousand years ago, that's where it started with Slav the Wise, that's what his name was.
[00:09:37.771 --> 00:09:46.117]  Well, they're called the Slavs after that guy who repelled the Islamicists and set up what is the Russian culture today.
[00:09:46.137 --> 00:09:53.122]  Putin said, we're just going to take part of the country as a demilitarized zone, and he invaded.
[00:09:55.302 --> 00:09:58.283]  Top German newspaper, Poland prepares for war with Russia.
[00:09:58.303 --> 00:10:01.444]  You can scroll down and click and see it in German for yourself.
[00:10:02.404 --> 00:10:07.625]  Now, Jack Veselbeck for over a year has been saying that he's one of the smartest people out there when it comes to military affairs.
[00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:09.666]  The guy's not stupid.
[00:10:10.826 --> 00:10:28.985]   And he's also Polish, speaks it and warned that they were going to install a new parliamentary head, who's the former deputy of the EU, And even though the majority of Poles don't want war with Russia, how do you get elected?
[00:10:29.025 --> 00:10:29.946]  Well, it's parliamentary.
[00:10:29.966 --> 00:10:34.830]  They bought off a bunch of the parties to combine the votes together to put him in as the Prime Minister.
[00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:46.618]  And they're arresting their party opposition, just like we see here in America, or like you see in Venezuela, or Brazil, or other totalitarian states.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.462]  And then the big one, they're preparing to remove Zelensky.
[00:10:51.482 --> 00:10:52.763]  We told you this a year ago.
[00:10:53.783 --> 00:10:56.744]  That they would blame him for the failure, but then kick off part two of the war.
[00:10:57.464 --> 00:10:59.585]  It's now AP Reuters everywhere.
[00:10:59.665 --> 00:11:00.586]  Long knives are out.
[00:11:01.326 --> 00:11:04.827]  Zelensky Ukrainian political establishment battle for supremacy.
[00:11:06.028 --> 00:11:07.368]  Senate leader Schumer, U.S.
[00:11:07.388 --> 00:11:11.930]  troops could be sent to fight Russia or Iran if Congress doesn't pass border bill.
[00:11:14.471 --> 00:11:16.272]  We are being held hostage.
[00:11:16.332 --> 00:11:19.033]  And if you see my articles today and they're bright yellow, I didn't pee on them.
[00:11:19.513 --> 00:11:21.093]  We haven't had them in a birdcage.
[00:11:21.254 --> 00:11:22.174]  The printer's going out.
[00:11:23.729 --> 00:11:28.553]  We put new cartridges in it, it's printing yellow, so that's side issue here.
[00:11:29.954 --> 00:11:38.681]  But it's just absolute madness, total and complete insanity.
[00:11:41.363 --> 00:11:48.358]   And all the main doctrines that kept us from having a nuclear war, Are being ignored.
[00:11:48.438 --> 00:11:52.480]  Remember just a year ago, Biden said, oh, we can't send Abrams tanks and F-16s.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.541]  That's World War III.
[00:11:54.182 --> 00:11:54.882]  And now they are.
[00:11:54.922 --> 00:11:59.505]  There's a threat continuum ladder that the Rand Corporation developed.
[00:12:01.066 --> 00:12:04.949]  And they're the brain of this thing, to a great extent, or a large part of it.
[00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.151]  And they said, you can't keep going down this road.
[00:12:08.431 --> 00:12:12.154]  So did the late Henry Kissinger a year and a half ago.
[00:12:13.328 --> 00:12:19.974]  So even the establishment has a bunch of their people saying this is crazy town.
[00:12:21.696 --> 00:12:36.530]  Now the United States and Japan are doing drills to attack China.
[00:12:39.076 --> 00:12:42.417]  Now, a lot of the media is like, oh, three years until there's war with Russia.
[00:12:42.917 --> 00:12:43.637]  That's un-independent.
[00:12:43.657 --> 00:12:43.917]  No, no.
[00:12:44.617 --> 00:12:49.998]  The report that leaked out of NATO a month ago says, as early as February, this February.
[00:12:52.118 --> 00:12:56.619]  And they said the probability goes up, substantively, by early next year.
[00:12:58.519 --> 00:12:59.600]  The globalists are in trouble.
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.200]  There's demonstrations against them all over the world.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.500]  Their policies are in trouble.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.880]  They, quote, lost the trust.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.741]  The people hate them.
[00:13:06.141 --> 00:13:07.421]  They are now known as the villains.
[00:13:08.848 --> 00:13:10.869]  They can't just sit up there and tell us you will eat the bugs.
[00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.732]  So they need a big war.
[00:13:16.294 --> 00:13:19.896]  And that's always the cherry on top of a new era they're trying to bring in.
[00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:26.561]  The Cashless Society, the entire New World Order system, and I got a bunch of news on that as well today.
[00:13:26.581 --> 00:13:27.682]  So let me tell you what we got here.
[00:13:28.943 --> 00:13:34.307]  The Tucker Carlson information that ties into the war, ties into free speech, ties into intimidation of citizens.
[00:13:34.507 --> 00:13:35.568]  It's like a Rosetta Stone.
[00:13:37.188 --> 00:13:39.470]  That really gives you a good picture of what's happening.
[00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.190]  We're gonna get into that.
[00:13:41.471 --> 00:13:42.252]  The corporate media.
[00:13:43.873 --> 00:13:46.515]  Completely and totally flipping out.
[00:13:47.616 --> 00:13:48.357]  At every level.
[00:13:50.138 --> 00:13:54.882]  Against Tucker and... You know, I never really told this story.
[00:13:56.643 --> 00:13:58.385]  Not because it made me sound like a coward.
[00:14:01.067 --> 00:14:03.229]  But just because it was just so over the top.
[00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:06.031]  But I went ahead and I tell it in this Tucker piece.
[00:14:07.554 --> 00:14:08.394]  But it was surreal.
[00:14:10.735 --> 00:14:20.558]  I got a Russian visa like five years ago because I was going to go over there and do some interviews and want to see Russia and they were calling everybody Russian agents and I was sick of it.
[00:14:20.598 --> 00:14:22.138]  I thought it'd be a good thing to do.
[00:14:22.398 --> 00:14:23.818]  Get a lot of attention, do a lot of interviews.
[00:14:26.239 --> 00:14:36.682]  And then I hadn't even announced it but the phone calls started coming in through different people in the government.
[00:14:37.932 --> 00:14:45.095]  That high-level CIA and others were saying, if you go, you're going to be designated as a Russian agent, and things are going to get really bad for you.
[00:14:46.395 --> 00:14:48.216]  And I didn't have a Putin interview secured.
[00:14:48.236 --> 00:14:51.557]  I was talking to RT, and they said, we'll get you into some of the press junkets.
[00:14:52.018 --> 00:14:53.738]  You'll be able to ask him a question, probably.
[00:14:53.778 --> 00:15:00.261]  And I was like, you know, no, I'm still just going to go, just as a joke, and I was going to wear a Russian fur hat.
[00:15:01.343 --> 00:15:02.804]  You know, say I'm there for my orders.
[00:15:03.244 --> 00:15:07.105]  I remember five years ago, I was still making fun of the Russia thing because I knew it was BS.
[00:15:07.705 --> 00:15:08.906]  But it was really starting to get nasty.
[00:15:08.926 --> 00:15:21.230]  They were indicting people and going up to Roger Stone and telling lies about him and that he was involved with Russia and WikiLeaks and Roger worked here when that was all going on and I knew none of it was true.
[00:15:22.991 --> 00:15:24.972]  And I was like, I'll give you a raise if you can get the...
[00:15:25.788 --> 00:15:29.651]  WikiLeaks interview, he goes, well, I know this radio host that knows him and I might be able to get him on.
[00:15:30.051 --> 00:15:32.192]  And if you remember, he was doing interviews everywhere at the time.
[00:15:34.414 --> 00:15:35.114]  Julian Assange.
[00:15:35.154 --> 00:15:37.456]  So I was just laughing at, you know, all this.
[00:15:38.696 --> 00:15:39.817]  But it started getting really serious.
[00:15:39.857 --> 00:15:48.162]  I was like, you know, I'm not going to, I'm not afraid to skydive, but I'm not going to do it because I don't want to just add a risk for no reason.
[00:15:48.423 --> 00:15:53.186]  Like a lot of people go because they like the chemicals, the brain releases.
[00:15:54.525 --> 00:16:05.232]  When you go to Las Vegas and play craps, or play blackjack, or play the roulette wheel, or play the slot machines, I will take risk if I think I need to, but I don't enjoy the risk.
[00:16:05.812 --> 00:16:06.933]  I don't get off on the risk.
[00:16:07.393 --> 00:16:10.696]  So I thought it was kind of gratuitous, so I didn't go to Russia.
[00:16:11.376 --> 00:16:20.582]  Well, we know that Tucker got threatened by the NSA and others, and it came out in the news later that indeed they were spying on him and did threaten him.
[00:16:22.236 --> 00:16:23.777]  Think about that, because they wanted him to know.
[00:16:24.237 --> 00:16:25.058]  Well, Tucker went.
[00:16:26.599 --> 00:16:34.323]  And I've got to say, that if I could get a Putin interview, locked in, I would go as well.
[00:16:35.704 --> 00:16:37.045]  Because then it wouldn't be gratuitous.
[00:16:37.445 --> 00:16:43.989]  And I was going to basically troll the left and dress up in a Russian outfit.
[00:16:44.009 --> 00:16:44.850]  I mean, I already did that here.
[00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:45.470]  People saw that.
[00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:52.407]   And they even ran on the national news that time we went to This place called Russia House has like Russian food down on 6th Street.
[00:16:53.487 --> 00:16:54.388]  Guys, find that video.
[00:16:55.028 --> 00:16:57.949]  And we just shot a real quick like 60-second joke video.
[00:16:58.630 --> 00:16:59.610]  And it was on national news.
[00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:06.614]  Look, Jones is a Russian because they've dumbed down the public so much that some people actually believe that.
[00:17:07.554 --> 00:17:13.317]  So, I didn't go because it wasn't worth it for a trolling operation.
[00:17:14.377 --> 00:17:17.359]  I do love to troll the left, but I said, no, I'm just not going to do it.
[00:17:19.953 --> 00:17:32.444]  But I do regret that I didn't go, because we need to throw this Russia gang thing back in their face, because you say, well, they tried to impeach Trump, they did all this, and they got exposed, but they're still doing it, and now they're starting World War III with Russia.
[00:17:34.766 --> 00:17:44.234]  So it's really, really, really, really important that we stand up for Tucker.
[00:17:45.433 --> 00:17:52.579]  Because you've got the neocons, Bill Kristol and others saying you shouldn't be allowed back in the country, behind the scenes.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.922]  I know Tucker's security people, they're great guys.
[00:17:57.463 --> 00:18:05.530]  A lot of nasty stuff's been done to Tucker that he hasn't talked about, and he has a lot of courage.
[00:18:08.673 --> 00:18:09.653]  And he also carries a gun.
[00:18:11.615 --> 00:18:12.336]  And he's a great shot.
[00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:14.111]  And I encouraged Tucker.
[00:18:14.151 --> 00:18:15.792]  I said, man, you're a great hunter, great shot.
[00:18:15.832 --> 00:18:16.992]  You ought to do this on TV.
[00:18:17.052 --> 00:18:19.012]  People need to know what an outdoorsman you are.
[00:18:19.032 --> 00:18:23.293]  And he's like, well, I've been growing up here in Maine since I was a kid, in between here and California.
[00:18:23.733 --> 00:18:24.974]  He said, no, no, no, no.
[00:18:25.434 --> 00:18:33.816]  But what he's doing is really historical and opens up a dialogue and needs to be done.
[00:18:34.016 --> 00:18:40.237]  And when the Putin interview drops, it's going to be absolutely massive.
[00:18:41.238 --> 00:18:42.438]  It's going to be seismic.
[00:18:43.536 --> 00:18:45.678]  And it's going to get 500 million views here in the U.S.
[00:18:45.738 --> 00:18:53.344]  alone, and it's going to cause a massive debate and really force this World War III situation out in the open.
[00:18:53.384 --> 00:19:07.957]  But, you know, there's so much stuff we've done the last six years since we got banned everywhere but Infowars.com and some radio stations and some TV stations, great folks, that every time I'm on there I think of something we did that is nowhere to be found except in our own archives.
[00:19:10.273 --> 00:19:15.197]  And so it's quite the job to go through all of our archives and get those out.
[00:19:15.217 --> 00:19:19.581]  But if the crew has the audio, when you're ready, let me know and I'll play this clip.
[00:19:21.122 --> 00:19:23.845]  Yeah, so this is five years ago.
[00:19:23.865 --> 00:19:26.187]  I was trolling the media.
[00:19:28.509 --> 00:19:30.851]  It's the one time I've gone down to that place that serves Russian food.
[00:19:30.871 --> 00:19:31.331]  It's pretty good.
[00:19:31.351 --> 00:19:31.752]  It's fun.
[00:19:32.532 --> 00:19:33.873]  They have vodka tastings and stuff.
[00:19:34.714 --> 00:19:41.421]   And, you know, the crew and us went down there and Right after this, I got three phone calls.
[00:19:43.585 --> 00:19:47.432]  And... Well, I got two phone calls.
[00:19:48.474 --> 00:19:48.834]  And then...
[00:19:51.761 --> 00:20:03.051]  Someone close to me that's got a long background in the military and law enforcement and federal agent said, man, I got a call by a high-level CIA guy that I worked with in Afghanistan.
[00:20:03.472 --> 00:20:11.940]  And he said, listen, there's a full task force on Jones and everybody that he's associated with.
[00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:20.724]  They are basically just designating you guys as Russians, so Jones better watch where he goes or what he does because they're looking for an excuse.
[00:20:21.144 --> 00:20:22.545]  And folks, that's how they kill people.
[00:20:23.345 --> 00:20:25.746]  And then they greenlight a foreign intelligence agency to kill you.
[00:20:26.526 --> 00:20:30.208]  So, when I tell you this stuff, this isn't a joke, it's not a game.
[00:20:31.128 --> 00:20:40.932]  Remember when Tucker came out two years ago and said, I was told by an NSA whistleblower that they're listening to everything I'm doing, they're watching me, they're reading this stuff, they're aware of it, and that I better not go to Russia.
[00:20:43.584 --> 00:20:58.975]  And what I was told was Putin told Tucker after this, listen, you're going to, for your own safety, now is not the time for this.
[00:21:00.637 --> 00:21:02.478]  So I'm not giving you the interview.
[00:21:04.599 --> 00:21:06.661]  I mean, that's, that's, and you know why?
[00:21:06.681 --> 00:21:12.025]  Because the Russians got told, you better not do this interview.
[00:21:14.378 --> 00:21:40.874]  And I later learned that when I used to go on RT a lot, and I mean, I've been on Iranian TV, Mexican TV, Brazilian TV, Japanese TV, British TV, and back when I would do the interviews, which is every day, it would be other interviews, so I probably did RT 50 times, probably did British TV 60, 70 times or more, did Japanese TV about 15 times, Iranian TV about 20, 30 times.
[00:21:40.894 --> 00:21:41.755]  I can't even keep track of it.
[00:21:42.608 --> 00:21:45.189]  But I finally stopped doing those interviews because I was so busy.
[00:21:46.589 --> 00:22:01.353]  And I later learned from the RT people, from their number two person, that, oh no, we got a State Department call, and this is like six years ago, seven years ago, and threatened them.
[00:22:02.293 --> 00:22:07.835]  And basically threatened them, if you know what's good for Alex Jones, you better stop trying to interview him.
[00:22:09.349 --> 00:22:16.337]  And only recently have they called up, and just to not be a wimp, I've gone on national, international RT, their biggest shows.
[00:22:16.978 --> 00:22:18.140]  Because I have a right to do that.
[00:22:19.341 --> 00:22:22.104]  And I have a right to expose the globalists that have hijacked our country.
[00:22:22.144 --> 00:22:33.754]   But this attempt by the criminals that run our government to Label any of us that want free speech and don't want World War III as foreign agents of fraud.
[00:22:34.114 --> 00:22:36.075]  It's the globalists that hate nation states.
[00:22:36.375 --> 00:22:37.876]  It's the globalists that hate borders.
[00:22:38.336 --> 00:22:40.056]  It's the globalists that are devaluing our currency.
[00:22:40.417 --> 00:22:41.977]  It's the globalists starting all the wars.
[00:22:42.277 --> 00:22:44.298]  It's the globalists doing drag queen pedophile time.
[00:22:44.518 --> 00:22:46.059]  It's the globalists funding race war.
[00:22:46.259 --> 00:22:53.982]  It's the globalists buying off almost all the attorney generals and judges and district attorneys.
[00:22:55.102 --> 00:22:56.523]  They're the ones doing it, folks!
[00:23:00.211 --> 00:23:00.951]  Look at this headline.
[00:23:02.352 --> 00:23:02.972]  CNBC.
[00:23:03.052 --> 00:23:05.173]  Tucker Carlson reportedly seen leaving Putin's office.
[00:23:05.213 --> 00:23:07.974]  Tensions rise at Russian-held nuclear plant.
[00:23:09.234 --> 00:23:10.495]  And that's the big false flag.
[00:23:10.535 --> 00:23:11.355]  Print that for me, guys.
[00:23:13.676 --> 00:23:15.616]  That's the big false flag they're getting ready for.
[00:23:16.036 --> 00:23:23.939]  They've been saying the Russians are going to blow up the biggest nuclear power plant in the world right there in eastern Ukraine.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.580]  And then they've said, oh, Russians hit it with artillery.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.501]  Russians hit it with missiles.
[00:23:28.821 --> 00:23:32.704]   And then later, The Ukrainians admit that they attack it themselves.
[00:23:34.546 --> 00:23:37.187]  Why the hell would the Russians blow up their own nuclear power plant they have?
[00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:41.851]  Kremlin cronies.
[00:23:42.531 --> 00:23:44.593]  Putin-Tucker interview will blow up U.S.
[00:23:44.693 --> 00:23:45.093]  election.
[00:23:45.113 --> 00:23:49.996]  And then of course it came out in the news.
[00:23:50.016 --> 00:23:52.298]  They're like, hell yeah, the NSA spied on Tucker.
[00:23:53.379 --> 00:23:57.842]  Hell yeah, they gave his private messages and information to the Washington Post, which is the CIA.
[00:23:59.983 --> 00:24:08.107]  And then our government's in the business that's all hijacked to call, you know, threaten Tucker, threaten me, do all this stuff.
[00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:13.289]  And I'm just fed up with it.
[00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:20.592]  But Tucker told me that I should go and maybe I'll go with him.
[00:24:21.012 --> 00:24:21.733]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:24:21.753 --> 00:24:24.834]  Maybe I'll jump on an airplane tomorrow.
[00:24:26.058 --> 00:24:32.227]  I know I've got Tate Brothers that want me to come this month to interview them in the Carpathian Mountains.
[00:24:32.748 --> 00:24:34.730]  God, that place is beautiful from the film I've seen.
[00:24:35.592 --> 00:24:36.773]  Prettiest place in the world, probably.
[00:24:36.793 --> 00:24:39.037]  At least for that type of topography.
[00:24:41.018 --> 00:24:45.702]  But I'm trying to hold down the fort here, ladies and gentlemen, as best I can.
[00:24:47.003 --> 00:24:49.085]  But it's just an incredibly dangerous time to be alive.
[00:24:49.105 --> 00:24:52.287]  And, you know, this morning, I got up at 3.30 in the morning.
[00:24:52.347 --> 00:24:53.008]  I couldn't sleep.
[00:24:54.609 --> 00:24:55.690]  And I was doing research.
[00:24:56.611 --> 00:25:04.958]  And I just said to myself, about 4 in the morning, I said, I've got to go on air and just absolutely lay it out to people that were sleepwalking into doom.
[00:25:05.698 --> 00:25:08.401]  At every level, things are unraveling and falling apart.
[00:25:08.881 --> 00:25:12.124]  And the globalists hate us and project their own hate of themselves on us.
[00:25:12.184 --> 00:25:18.490]  But did you know there's 450-something active nuclear power plants in the world?
[00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:24.215]  And then hundreds and hundreds of other nuke power plants for submarines, aircraft carriers.
[00:25:24.235 --> 00:25:27.458]  There's a bunch of research reactors.
[00:25:28.679 --> 00:25:30.741]  There's around a thousand reactors we know of.
[00:25:30.921 --> 00:25:31.802]  There's probably a lot more.
[00:25:33.141 --> 00:25:37.083]  And our own government and other governments' history is when they leak or explode, they cover them up.
[00:25:37.504 --> 00:25:44.968]  We had a Chernobyl event back in the 50s with a sodium nuclear reactor in California that they didn't declassify until the 80s.
[00:25:46.249 --> 00:25:47.429]  It was a Chernobyl bad.
[00:25:47.449 --> 00:25:48.370]  It was huge.
[00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:49.531]  Total meltdown.
[00:25:50.691 --> 00:25:51.011]  Look it up.
[00:25:51.772 --> 00:25:58.676]  But did you know out of the 450 plus public reactors that create power worldwide, every one of them leaks.
[00:25:59.737 --> 00:26:02.098]  Most of them have had big disasters that get covered up.
[00:26:04.324 --> 00:26:10.647]  And they don't even, most of them are 45 years old now, and they don't even update them or upkeep them, and they just don't care.
[00:26:11.607 --> 00:26:17.129]  What type of establishment is that, where the left doesn't even care about leaking nuclear reactors?
[00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:20.611]  Because we can, nuclear power works great if it's done right.
[00:26:21.291 --> 00:26:27.033]  I mean, people need to sign an agreement when they work there that, you know, they're facing the death penalty if they don't do their job properly.
[00:26:28.714 --> 00:26:40.589]   And just, you know, Japan building three General Electric Plutonium reactors on top of the biggest fault line in the world in a tsunami zone?
[00:26:40.609 --> 00:26:44.531]  I mean, why did General Electric even agree to that?
[00:26:45.072 --> 00:26:47.193]  And the Japanese are probably some of the smartest people in the world.
[00:26:47.213 --> 00:26:48.053]  What's their problem?
[00:26:48.894 --> 00:26:50.155]  Like, what is going on here?
[00:26:51.796 --> 00:26:54.458]  It's like putting cyanide in your kid's weenies for no reason.
[00:26:55.398 --> 00:26:56.919]  I mean, what?
[00:26:57.019 --> 00:26:57.179]  What?
[00:26:57.299 --> 00:26:57.960]  I mean, huh.
[00:26:59.341 --> 00:27:03.003]  And then the poison shots that have killed at least 20 million people.
[00:27:03.993 --> 00:27:04.754]  And they admit it.
[00:27:05.794 --> 00:27:08.056]  And the cancer is just exploding.
[00:27:08.957 --> 00:27:12.560]  And I'm just asking myself, why are we committing suicide?
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:13.921]  As a culture.
[00:27:14.661 --> 00:27:15.302]  As a species.
[00:27:15.742 --> 00:27:18.024]  And the globalists have got to be smart.
[00:27:18.584 --> 00:27:19.905]  Can't they look at where this is going?
[00:27:19.926 --> 00:27:22.007]  They'll never get away with killing everybody now.
[00:27:22.207 --> 00:27:23.929]  They'll never get away with their new world order.
[00:27:23.949 --> 00:27:30.434]  They'll never get away with cutting all the resources off and hoping we'll all just kill each other while they sit off in some underground bunker.
[00:27:30.454 --> 00:27:33.016]  We're gonna go to those bunkers and eat you.
[00:27:34.485 --> 00:27:34.905]  Literally.
[00:27:37.347 --> 00:27:39.428]  If your scenario goes the way you think it is.
[00:27:39.448 --> 00:27:42.410]  It doesn't matter how many robots you've got in there to protect you.
[00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:44.611]  And that's what they think.
[00:27:44.631 --> 00:27:49.173]  They think, oh, as soon as we get enough robots, enough drones, we don't need human armies anymore.
[00:27:49.193 --> 00:27:54.216]  Because see, they need the armies to go out and do things to their own people that are clearly going to destroy their own future.
[00:27:54.937 --> 00:27:59.459]  So they try to dumb us down, make us evil so we do that, try to turn us into robots.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:01.981]  That hasn't worked.
[00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:06.552]  And I just sit back, and I see the ignorance level.
[00:28:06.952 --> 00:28:09.434]  There was hundreds of thousands of comments on X today.
[00:28:11.054 --> 00:28:17.738]  In a couple posts I did, millions of views, tens of thousands of comments, and I was trying to read through it, it was just so fascinating.
[00:28:18.839 --> 00:28:24.342]  And I'm like, explaining that the ice caps are getting bigger, not smaller.
[00:28:26.964 --> 00:28:40.136]   And I'm explaining that the ice caps were getting smaller on Mars, Until about 2010, because there was some warming, and the solar system cooled off because the sun cooled off some, and so our ice caps got bigger and so did Mars.
[00:28:40.716 --> 00:28:49.738]  And I see people commenting, they're like professors and stuff, and you go read their bios, and they're like, the sun has no effect on climate, that is well established.
[00:28:50.418 --> 00:28:52.439]  Well any astrophysicist will tell you it's 99.9% of it!
[00:28:56.718 --> 00:29:03.653]  I've interviewed astrophysicists, but it's just absolutely frightening how ignorant people are.
[00:29:05.497 --> 00:29:06.880]  Absolute morons.
[00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:09.671]  Alright, I'm loaded for Bear on the News.
[00:29:10.212 --> 00:29:12.333]  I've got the Tucker Carlson breakdown when we come back.
[00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:15.336]  And I've got that little joke Russia piece all there as well.
[00:29:15.916 --> 00:29:18.078]  And then we've just got three huge guests in studio.
[00:29:18.138 --> 00:29:19.199]  Michael Yones, first up.
[00:29:19.219 --> 00:29:20.139]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:24.062]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[00:29:24.462 --> 00:29:31.488]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[00:29:31.668 --> 00:29:33.649]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:34.910]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:35.631]  He loved the idea.
[00:29:35.951 --> 00:29:39.473]  What would you call the debate and discussions about a pro-human future?
[00:29:39.493 --> 00:29:40.373]  Just Team Humanity?
[00:29:40.433 --> 00:29:41.314]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[00:29:41.474 --> 00:29:41.914]  Absolutely.
[00:29:42.234 --> 00:29:43.615]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[00:29:43.695 --> 00:29:47.116]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[00:29:47.356 --> 00:29:54.800]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:06.788]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[00:30:07.068 --> 00:30:08.409]  We're told humans are the problem.
[00:30:08.429 --> 00:30:09.410]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:13.973]  We're told all this garbage, so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[00:30:14.253 --> 00:30:14.974]  We're not going to do that.
[00:30:15.234 --> 00:30:19.837]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at mfullworthstore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:32.383]  And Joe Rogan, and Elon Musk, and David Icke, and so many other great people.
[00:30:33.423 --> 00:30:39.925]  All the most popular people across the world, not just here, are anti-globalist, anti-New World Order.
[00:30:40.526 --> 00:30:42.426]  We have now identified the New World Order.
[00:30:43.226 --> 00:30:45.467]  That has been my goal for 30 years on air.
[00:30:45.527 --> 00:30:46.968]  Coming up in April will be 30 years.
[00:30:50.369 --> 00:30:52.546]   And That was our goal.
[00:30:53.286 --> 00:31:06.310]  I believed, I knew, that if we exposed their plan while it was in the beta phase, that we might be able to stop it in the beta phase, but I was sure once it went into operational, we'd have a very good chance of beating it, because we would have planted so many seeds.
[00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:34.182]   And I would just marvel how the New York Times would say there's no New World Order, no global government, no megabanks controlling anything, and then they would have their foreign affairs publications and CFR publications, And they're super PhD, you know, heads of political science at Harvard, Yale, Georgetown, Princeton, University of Texas, writing 300, 400, 500, 1,100 page books.
[00:31:34.222 --> 00:31:35.663]  Tragedy and Hope's 1,100 pages long.
[00:31:36.243 --> 00:31:37.183]  I read the whole damn thing.
[00:31:39.345 --> 00:31:39.725]  When I was 20.
[00:31:40.145 --> 00:31:44.228]  Tried to read it again a few years ago, couldn't get through 100 pages of it.
[00:31:45.925 --> 00:31:50.208]  And it's just the head of the Georgetown Political Science Department, Bill Clinton's main mentor.
[00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:55.872]  Carol Quigley taught me everything I know except for David Rockefeller.
[00:31:56.413 --> 00:32:05.640]  When I was 16, when David came to visit me and my mama, he said that I was going to be president one day and I just couldn't believe it.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.461]  But thank you, David Rockefeller.
[00:32:07.501 --> 00:32:09.843]  He started crying on TV as last year in the presidency.
[00:32:10.183 --> 00:32:11.204]  That video's somewhere.
[00:32:11.464 --> 00:32:13.165]  C-SPAN is so searchable now, guys.
[00:32:13.345 --> 00:32:13.806]  Go find...
[00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.691]  Bill Clinton talks about David Rockefeller.
[00:32:18.711 --> 00:32:20.952]  There's dozens of times, but he starts crying.
[00:32:21.053 --> 00:32:21.713]  And you know why?
[00:32:22.253 --> 00:32:27.296]  The governor was his brother or whatever it was.
[00:32:27.316 --> 00:32:28.656]  It was a close relation to David.
[00:32:30.537 --> 00:32:31.718]  I forget which Rockefeller it was.
[00:32:31.778 --> 00:32:32.678]  It'll pop in my head in a minute.
[00:32:33.119 --> 00:32:34.219]  Winthrop Rockefeller.
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:39.081]  He was the governor, and she was a prostitute in the Capitol.
[00:32:39.622 --> 00:32:40.102]  Little Rock.
[00:32:40.122 --> 00:32:41.162]  This is on record, by the way.
[00:32:41.683 --> 00:32:43.984]  And reportedly, Bill Clinton is a Rockefeller.
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.302]  So, that's what you see there.
[00:32:50.042 --> 00:32:52.744]  And Rockefeller would come visit him when he was a kid.
[00:32:55.205 --> 00:32:56.006]  Bill Clinton said that.
[00:32:56.586 --> 00:33:16.294]   Just like, in Dreams of My Father, Obama's book, he talks about how much he loved Frank Marshall Davis, the former deputy head of the Communist Party USA, the head of all their newspapers, who lived in Hawaii, and he would quote, spend summers with Frank Marshall Davis, who he said was like a father to him.
[00:33:17.814 --> 00:33:21.555]  And then his mother is in the black and white porn mags.
[00:33:21.975 --> 00:33:27.416]  It's her on the same couch, in the same house, the same pictures, at Frank Marshall Davis's house.
[00:33:27.436 --> 00:33:28.536]  He was also a pornographer.
[00:33:29.716 --> 00:33:30.676]  So it's his daddy.
[00:33:32.357 --> 00:33:33.277]  Wasn't born in Kenya.
[00:33:33.317 --> 00:33:34.357]  All that was a fake story.
[00:33:34.377 --> 00:33:36.857]  That's why I used to say I was born in Kenya when he was a senator.
[00:33:36.877 --> 00:33:39.238]  People say, you say you're born in Kenya in two speeches.
[00:33:40.359 --> 00:33:43.083]  That's the PSYOP because it's Frank Marshall Davis.
[00:33:45.285 --> 00:33:45.866]  Side issue.
[00:33:45.906 --> 00:33:47.669]  It's just wild.
[00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:51.273]  So, let's go ahead and air.
[00:33:53.362 --> 00:34:01.184]  This breakdown that I've also posted on X and I'm asking everybody to go get it and repost it off of X because it needs to be seen.
[00:34:01.224 --> 00:34:07.806]  It's a message to Tucker and I talked to Tucker quite a bit, but this message is all of his great crew and his people to really listen to me.
[00:34:07.826 --> 00:34:08.886]  And I know he listens to me.
[00:34:09.387 --> 00:34:10.567]  He's also extremely smart.
[00:34:10.587 --> 00:34:15.908]  So I'm not trying to say, you know, he needs me to explain how the cow ate the cabbage or how the world works.
[00:34:15.948 --> 00:34:30.854]   But the headline on Real Alex Jones at X is Tucker Carlson lands historic Tucker Carlson lands history-changing interview with Putin, and I say, this is a warning, please don't sit on the interview.
[00:34:30.874 --> 00:34:37.876]  Because I know his crew is awesome, and it's usually good to hype it and sit on something and polish it and, you know.
[00:34:39.116 --> 00:34:47.598]  If I was them, and I don't know what they're going to do, but I've also texted Tucker this, and I would sit in the hotel room until it's done, and I would release it now.
[00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:50.519]  Because these people are dangerous.
[00:34:51.539 --> 00:34:53.621]  They do not want Putin to be heard by the world.
[00:34:54.922 --> 00:34:56.744]  So, it's quite the moment.
[00:34:57.304 --> 00:35:00.487]  Let's go ahead and roll my emergency message to Tucker Carlson.
[00:35:01.749 --> 00:35:08.495]  The biggest newspaper in Germany, Bild, is now reporting that Poland is preparing to go to war with Russia.
[00:35:09.272 --> 00:35:12.093]  The UK is reporting that they're preparing to go to war with Russia.
[00:35:12.453 --> 00:35:13.633]  So is Sweden.
[00:35:13.993 --> 00:35:18.455]  This is full-on escalation to nuclear world war three.
[00:35:18.895 --> 00:35:19.795]  Armageddon stuff.
[00:35:20.395 --> 00:35:23.636]  And we should be talking to people like Vladimir Putin.
[00:35:23.996 --> 00:35:27.457]  Just like President Kennedy did during the Cuban Missile Crisis to Khrushchev.
[00:35:27.857 --> 00:35:30.758]  But instead, the communication channels have been cut off.
[00:35:31.238 --> 00:35:37.900]  So, an emissary from America for world peace, Tucker, has gone to Moscow to interview Vladimir Putin.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.263]  And the globalists are calling him a traitor.
[00:35:40.783 --> 00:35:41.784]  No, he's a hero.
[00:35:42.085 --> 00:35:48.252]  Those of you starting World War 3 are treasonous against humanity, and we're going to stop you.
[00:35:48.793 --> 00:35:54.540]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:35:55.041 --> 00:35:57.163]  InfoWars.com forward slash go.
[00:35:58.954 --> 00:36:00.395]  Massive speculation.
[00:36:00.475 --> 00:36:02.576]  You could cut the suspense with a knife.
[00:36:03.177 --> 00:36:08.420]  Has Tucker Carlson gotten the big, in-depth, history-changing interview with Vladimir Putin?
[00:36:09.161 --> 00:36:11.002]  I know that I talked to Tucker before he went to Europe.
[00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:14.084]  He told me he was going to do something very, very exciting.
[00:36:14.104 --> 00:36:15.725]  It was going to be huge.
[00:36:16.285 --> 00:36:17.606]  Wouldn't say specifically what.
[00:36:17.666 --> 00:36:19.407]  Told me he was going to first be going to Turkey.
[00:36:19.427 --> 00:36:21.189]  That he'd be gone for three weeks.
[00:36:23.763 --> 00:36:31.705]  Obviously he's in Moscow, and the word now being reported by Newsweek and some other publications is that he did get the Putin interview.
[00:36:32.425 --> 00:36:46.649]  Now, I'm not going to tell you what I privately talked about with Tucker that's off record, and there's really not that much, but what he did tell me that I know is okay to talk about is that he's blown away how nice Russia is, how nice the people are.
[00:36:46.729 --> 00:36:48.510]  He says he hasn't seen a single U.S.
[00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:50.830]  city that's as nice as what is in Russia.
[00:36:51.551 --> 00:36:52.511]  It just blew his mind.
[00:36:53.471 --> 00:36:57.593]  And even more stuff's coming after the Putin interview.
[00:36:58.173 --> 00:37:01.135]  And again, I haven't talked to him in the last day or so.
[00:37:01.155 --> 00:37:06.638]  I don't know if it's true that he landed the Putin interview, but you've got such an interesting person in Tucker and so smart.
[00:37:07.158 --> 00:37:13.661]  And then Vladimir Putin, at this time in the world, is probably the most important person in the world after somebody like Elon Musk.
[00:37:14.081 --> 00:37:16.942]   Because people like Biden and stuff are just puppets.
[00:37:16.942 --> 00:37:19.021]  You can say Xi Jinping is very important as well.
[00:37:19.021 --> 00:37:21.900]  Whether you like Xi Jinping, I certainly don't like him.
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.521]  But we're living in a very, very historic moment right now.
[00:37:25.521 --> 00:37:29.442]   And so I just texted Tucker and said, did you land the big interview?
[00:37:29.442 --> 00:37:32.561]   He usually holds his cards pretty close to his vest with all his production.
[00:37:32.561 --> 00:37:33.402]  He's very professional.
[00:37:33.402 --> 00:37:34.521]  So is his crew.
[00:37:34.521 --> 00:37:42.601]   But a little bird told me that indeed he's gotten the interview with Putin.
[00:37:43.306 --> 00:37:51.329]  And I would just tell Tucker, and I'll tell him this when I talk to him, that they're really scared of you, Tucker, because you are a folk hero all over the world, not just here.
[00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:53.209]  Peck is even more popular overseas.
[00:37:53.249 --> 00:37:53.730]  It's crazy.
[00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:57.911]  And you need to be very, very careful.
[00:37:58.572 --> 00:38:01.573]  And I think you're in danger while the interview's not out.
[00:38:02.513 --> 00:38:09.255]   I know your fabulous crew has a tendency to Trying to polish things and sit on it and promote it and
[00:38:09.255 --> 00:38:10.775]  that's great.
[00:38:10.775 --> 00:38:13.494]  But I would not do that if I was you.
[00:38:13.494 --> 00:38:19.055]   Because the first thing, when I started thinking about this, is, and Tedder is smart, so this
[00:38:19.055 --> 00:38:22.494]   is kind of a message to Tucker too and to his crew, you need to get the damn thing out
[00:38:22.494 --> 00:38:25.773]   immediately before you get on any other airplanes or anything like that.
[00:38:25.773 --> 00:38:26.773]  And I'm not kidding.
[00:38:26.773 --> 00:38:28.294]  The Globalists are cornered.
[00:38:28.294 --> 00:38:29.294]  They're desperate.
[00:38:29.294 --> 00:38:33.535]   You've warned Trump that on this continuum of tyranny that they've done against him,
[00:38:33.535 --> 00:38:38.255]   the prosecutions and demonizations and kangaroo trials that the next thing is assassination.
[00:38:38.485 --> 00:38:39.346]  And of course it is.
[00:38:39.386 --> 00:38:40.287]  They're calling for Trump's death.
[00:38:40.307 --> 00:38:45.132]  Well, Tucker, we all know if you ran for president, you're probably the only person that could beat Trump.
[00:38:45.712 --> 00:38:45.992]  Okay?
[00:38:46.593 --> 00:38:50.717]  You're more popular than Trump with the grassroots.
[00:38:50.877 --> 00:38:53.019]  And I'm not trying to get into an ego battle here.
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:55.341]  I'm just simply pointing that out, Tucker.
[00:38:55.601 --> 00:38:55.801]  Okay?
[00:38:56.662 --> 00:39:01.146]  And let's not forget how much courage Tucker Carlson has to go do this interview.
[00:39:01.967 --> 00:39:07.252]  You'd think in the past that you wouldn't need any courage at all because reporters are allowed to go interview who they want.
[00:39:07.292 --> 00:39:17.221]   But in this age of tyranny, as George Orwell said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth, revolutionary act, in this time of men being cucked, And cowards.
[00:39:17.721 --> 00:39:21.064]  He's standing up as an example for us all and truth is contagious.
[00:39:21.484 --> 00:39:23.666]  Remember, he said he was threatened by the NSA.
[00:39:24.026 --> 00:39:29.131]  He was told by NSA whistleblowers that they were spying on him and tried to designate him as a Russian agent.
[00:39:29.151 --> 00:39:35.175]  And then when he was actually going to go, he got hell of a contact saying, look, you'll be designated as an enemy of the state.
[00:39:35.216 --> 00:39:36.216]  They'll come after you.
[00:39:36.537 --> 00:39:37.637]  He's on record saying that.
[00:39:38.318 --> 00:39:39.939]  And you know, I never really told this story.
[00:39:39.959 --> 00:39:43.662]  But do you remember when I got my Russian visa?
[00:39:44.588 --> 00:39:45.509]  Like five years ago?
[00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:47.911]  And I thought the whole Russiagate thing was a joke.
[00:39:48.291 --> 00:39:50.072]  I mean, I wasn't taking it seriously because I knew it was a fraud.
[00:39:50.092 --> 00:39:54.356]  I didn't know how serious they were coming after people that are against World War III or question their tyranny.
[00:39:55.317 --> 00:40:00.841]  We got contacted by high-level CIA and threatened as well three separate times.
[00:40:01.221 --> 00:40:03.483]  So I'll put on screen a shot of my Russian visa.
[00:40:04.384 --> 00:40:09.068]  And so by then I started taking it serious because they started arresting people and indicting people that were totally innocent.
[00:40:09.088 --> 00:40:10.729]  Went to General Flynn and Roger Stone.
[00:40:10.769 --> 00:40:12.170]  So I said, hey, I better not go.
[00:40:13.391 --> 00:40:20.442]  Just because I was tied down here with my children and all the stuff going on, and I probably should have just said, screw you and gone.
[00:40:20.462 --> 00:40:26.311]  I'm being honest about the fact that when that happened, I was like, wow, this is this is wild.
[00:40:27.353 --> 00:40:28.194]  And I kind of weighed.
[00:40:29.126 --> 00:40:33.606]   you know, the different angles. Plus, I didn't have a Putin interview set up. I've been talking
[00:40:33.606 --> 00:40:37.365]   to RT some and they had said, well, we'll get you into some of the news junkets where you can
[00:40:37.365 --> 00:40:42.805]   ask a question. But that was just an off chance thing. So I'm just giving you some of the history
[00:40:42.805 --> 00:40:47.126]   of this, folks. Just like they threatened Tucker, they threatened me and I didn't go.
[00:40:47.126 --> 00:40:52.886]   Okay. So, so you have to understand, Tucker went and I'm being honest about the fact that I didn't
[00:40:52.886 --> 00:40:58.644]   because I understood there was a giant witch hunt going on and I didn't want to like basically
[00:40:58.644 --> 00:41:03.126]   play into their hands. But that was wrong, ladies and gentlemen, because I had nothing to do with
[00:41:03.126 --> 00:41:06.485]   the Russians and I have a right to travel and do what I want. This is a load of crap.
[00:41:06.485 --> 00:41:12.726]   So you make my life a lot safer because five, six, seven years ago, the globalists decided that I was
[00:41:12.726 --> 00:41:16.805]   the big, you know, populist folk hero that had to be destroyed. And so they've kind of moved their
[00:41:16.805 --> 00:41:22.006]   attack over to you. And I think overall you do a much better job than I do. So I think.
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:25.601]  Again, you're the main target, and I'm not wishing any of this.
[00:41:25.641 --> 00:41:27.022]  I'm not hoping any of this, obviously.
[00:41:27.382 --> 00:41:31.003]  People always spin it when I warn Trump he needs to really be safe.
[00:41:31.783 --> 00:41:35.925]  I'm drawing attention to this so that we can all pray for Tucker and his amazing crew.
[00:41:36.685 --> 00:41:42.687]  I know that I'm planning, at the end of the month when he gets back, they've got me in a slot to come interview him.
[00:41:43.327 --> 00:41:47.529]  But he's so busy, I might just try to get him as fast as I can just to pop on my show, as he's promised to do that.
[00:41:48.289 --> 00:41:49.209]  But this is just wild.
[00:41:49.609 --> 00:41:50.790]  I've also got David Icke coming on.
[00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:56.932]  Friday in the second hour and in the third hour to discuss and debate Elon Musk.
[00:41:57.352 --> 00:41:59.713]  He thinks Elon Musk is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[00:41:59.733 --> 00:42:06.055]  I think Elon Musk is a maverick who's moving more and more towards us every day very rapidly, so I'm not gonna...
[00:42:06.635 --> 00:42:10.875]   you know, disparage him when he's moved so much in our direction. But I also understand David's
[00:42:10.875 --> 00:42:13.195]  view so I'll be talking about that a lot on Friday as well.
[00:42:13.195 --> 00:42:18.275]   I'm getting ready to go do my show at 11 a.m. Central here. You can watch it at Real Alex Jones and
[00:42:18.275 --> 00:42:23.595]   at Infowars.com/show. Of course, stations across the country. But awesome job, Tucker.
[00:42:23.799 --> 00:42:26.120]  And I can't wait to hear who else he's going to interview in Europe.
[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:27.720]  Because he's only been there for a week.
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.961]  So he's got two weeks left in Europe.
[00:42:31.061 --> 00:42:31.622]  I didn't pry.
[00:42:31.662 --> 00:42:32.442]  He was just giddy.
[00:42:32.502 --> 00:42:37.624]  I've never seen Tucker or never heard Tucker so excited as he is about this Europe trip.
[00:42:38.104 --> 00:42:39.465]  He was excited about this months ago.
[00:42:40.525 --> 00:42:42.146]  He told me he was going to Europe or something big.
[00:42:42.166 --> 00:42:43.086]  I went, oh, something big?
[00:42:43.126 --> 00:42:43.506]  Oh, yeah.
[00:42:43.946 --> 00:42:46.647]  So it is the Putin interview.
[00:42:46.667 --> 00:42:47.707]  He certainly went there to get it.
[00:42:48.287 --> 00:42:49.908]  And I would imagine he did get it.
[00:42:50.388 --> 00:42:52.209]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is historic.
[00:42:52.229 --> 00:42:54.929]  Oh, I almost forgot the big reason I cut this video.
[00:42:57.930 --> 00:42:59.591]  The reason I put this report out.
[00:42:59.611 --> 00:43:07.637]   I also have some other sources that are reporting to me what Putin is planning to come out with
[00:43:07.637 --> 00:43:09.018]  next, exposing the West.
[00:43:09.018 --> 00:43:14.257]   And that's the bioweapon labs and what their discoveries were and what their findings were.
[00:43:14.257 --> 00:43:19.737]   And the word is, is that even when Putin talks to Tucker, which we're told has already happened,
[00:43:19.737 --> 00:43:24.138]   it's going to be a lengthy interview and that he's going to basically report to the American
[00:43:24.138 --> 00:43:30.177]   people from the Russian perspective about what's really happening over in Ukraine.
[00:43:30.177 --> 00:43:33.578]   This whole thing is being spun as election meddling by the Russians.
[00:43:33.578 --> 00:43:35.898]  How dare them be interviewed by a famous journalist.
[00:43:35.898 --> 00:43:39.458]   But we saw Barbara Walters go and interview the Ayatollah Khomeini in Saddam Hussein.
[00:43:39.458 --> 00:43:42.098]  We saw Tom Brokaw again, rather.
[00:43:42.098 --> 00:43:43.818]  Peter Jennings, they all did it.
[00:43:43.762 --> 00:43:47.063]  You're supposed to go interview these people, but I'm not going to lie to folks.
[00:43:48.804 --> 00:43:50.844]  I don't think Putin is an enemy of America.
[00:43:51.364 --> 00:43:55.706]  Xi Jinping clearly is, and has taken over much of our government and our system, and the left totally allied with him.
[00:43:56.006 --> 00:44:01.828]  The globalists that hate our guts, they're dissolving our border, that are doing all these horrible criminal things, hate the Russians.
[00:44:02.248 --> 00:44:07.310]  And they started the war nine years ago by overthrowing the Ukrainian government, and there's a whole backstory to that civil war.
[00:44:09.691 --> 00:44:16.855]  I think it's important for people not to be bullied into being haters of Russia just to hate Russia.
[00:44:17.135 --> 00:44:20.437]  If Russia was on our business like China or like Hollywood, I'd hate Russia.
[00:44:20.977 --> 00:44:21.898]  I'd hate Vladimir Putin.
[00:44:22.518 --> 00:44:26.420]  But it's not Vladimir Putin that's trying to put our president in jail for no reason.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.262]  It's not Vladimir Putin that's got drag queen story time.
[00:44:29.282 --> 00:44:33.664]  It's not Vladimir Putin promoting pedophilia on the nightly news and in our elementary schools.
[00:44:34.825 --> 00:44:36.886]  It's a total distraction, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:38.057 --> 00:44:42.337]  onto Russia for what's going on here domestically.
[00:44:42.337 --> 00:44:44.697]  So what did Vladimir Putin do to you?
[00:44:44.697 --> 00:44:47.816]   And then if you don't want war with Russia, you're a Russian agent.
[00:44:47.816 --> 00:44:49.457]  No, it means you're sane.
[00:44:49.457 --> 00:44:53.816]   I don't like the Iranian mullahs, but I don't want war with them because it all leads to
[00:44:53.816 --> 00:44:55.256]  nuclear war.
[00:44:55.256 --> 00:44:59.977]  So some big, big news is coming out of this Putin interview.
[00:44:59.984 --> 00:45:01.025]  It's going to be historic.
[00:45:01.645 --> 00:45:04.667]  And again, I think Tucker Carlson needs to get it out immediately.
[00:45:04.687 --> 00:45:07.589]  It's too tempting a target for the globalists.
[00:45:08.689 --> 00:45:12.091]  Bottom line, have dozens of copies sent to everybody you know, if you're going to sit on it.
[00:45:12.772 --> 00:45:18.455]  Because I know sitting on it makes it that much bigger, but something like this, I just gut level, instinctive level, spiritual level.
[00:45:18.975 --> 00:45:20.676]  Get it out now, Tucker, and we love you.
[00:45:21.421 --> 00:45:27.541]   While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:45:27.541 --> 00:45:30.121]  InfoWars.com/dope.
[00:45:30.121 --> 00:45:33.621]  All right.
[00:45:33.621 --> 00:45:41.260]   Michael Yon, incredible former Green Beret and the top wartime correspondent
[00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:45.501]   who's been all over Central South America, Mexico, Eagle Pass is here.
[00:45:45.883 --> 00:45:52.608]  And I'm glad that the cat drug in Doc Chambers with him, the former Green Beret commander and great patriot who had a huge success at the border.
[00:45:54.117 --> 00:45:57.320]  14 governors came down, thousands of people, huge attention.
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:59.201]  The left didn't get what they wanted.
[00:45:59.901 --> 00:46:01.082]  They caught some provocateurs.
[00:46:01.883 --> 00:46:05.906]  And so Doc's going to be with us in the second part of the interview.
[00:46:06.766 --> 00:46:07.807]  He'll be in the control room.
[00:46:08.247 --> 00:46:11.850]  I built these really cool big control rooms so we could have guests in there too.
[00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:14.111]  It really gives that ambiance and I like it.
[00:46:14.131 --> 00:46:18.334]  So he's going to be in there talking about what happened and what's coming next.
[00:46:18.354 --> 00:46:26.890]   We're going to talk about Wars, we're going to talk about the border, we're going to talk about the so-called border deal that just makes Biden a dictator.
[00:46:27.691 --> 00:46:30.053]  By the way, guys, I pulled yesterday's stack off the desk.
[00:46:30.654 --> 00:46:32.135]  Will you guys dig back into it?
[00:46:32.155 --> 00:46:35.278]  I know it's like two feet tall, quite the job.
[00:46:35.739 --> 00:46:37.601]  Literally, yesterday's stack was this big.
[00:46:38.542 --> 00:46:42.986]  And get me the shots of the bill where it makes Biden a dictator on the border.
[00:46:45.979 --> 00:46:47.621]  And then sets up a court in D.C.
[00:46:47.681 --> 00:46:54.346]  to be the only place any border issue can be heard, so they can commit whatever crimes they want with human smuggling and more.
[00:46:54.907 --> 00:46:58.970]  So, let me tell you what's coming up today, because I've been so busy covering other news, I haven't gotten to that.
[00:47:00.432 --> 00:47:03.434]  We have Michael Yon and Doc Chambers.
[00:47:04.297 --> 00:47:09.577]   In studio, we have Dr. Stella Emanuel in studio, because we had technical issues,
[00:47:09.577 --> 00:47:13.336]   I'm sure she did last two weeks ago, she's back with us in studio.
[00:47:13.336 --> 00:47:20.456]   She was remote before and we have Lauren Witzke, who's a really smart journalist and lady,
[00:47:20.456 --> 00:47:25.896]  with us to cover the waterfront in the fourth hour today.
[00:47:26.863 --> 00:47:36.851]  She's also a great media producer so we're working with her and it's great to have her have her here with us today in studio as well.
[00:47:37.592 --> 00:47:39.534]  We got about eight minutes to break here.
[00:47:41.175 --> 00:47:53.570]   All this news ties together but but getting back to the Tucker Carlson thing The story is, why does it scare the establishment here so much that he is bigger than Joe Rogan?
[00:47:53.631 --> 00:48:02.955]  And it's not about how big you are, but when it comes to really reaching the most people, I have to say Tucker has eclipsed Rogan.
[00:48:03.835 --> 00:48:06.196]  And Rogan's gotten really hardcore and is really awake.
[00:48:06.236 --> 00:48:08.297]  I told you three years ago, look for Rogan to get hardcore.
[00:48:08.317 --> 00:48:09.358]  He's gotten more and more hardcore.
[00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:13.553]  Because I know Joe, we hang out routinely, we talk almost every day.
[00:48:14.173 --> 00:48:15.675]  Joe's a great guy, 100% real.
[00:48:16.836 --> 00:48:19.498]  But it's just hard for him to believe the globals are this evil.
[00:48:19.538 --> 00:48:26.263]  But he finally gets it, and I'll just tell you, in private, he's 100% on board.
[00:48:26.744 --> 00:48:28.786]  And I said you'd see that on air, and you are seeing it.
[00:48:28.886 --> 00:48:30.287]  So that's good news.
[00:48:30.327 --> 00:48:31.728]  It shows how far freedom's come.
[00:48:31.768 --> 00:48:38.354]  But the reason I raise that is, without even looking for these stories today, look what's in the news, okay?
[00:48:39.326 --> 00:48:41.047]  Because if I looked for this, I'd have 500 stories.
[00:48:44.288 --> 00:48:47.969]  Amazon bowed to White House pressure to conceal COVID books.
[00:48:48.870 --> 00:49:03.836]  Now documents have come out in the House Judiciary Committee in their weaponization hearings, the third round, that the White House gave a list of thousands of books and publications they wanted either banned or non-searchable shadow banned.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:12.944]  Exposing the lab leak, exposing that it's gained a function, and exposing the shots, which everything we said turned out to be true.
[00:49:13.725 --> 00:49:16.126]   Going after Robert F. Kennedy Jr.' 's book that was number one.
[00:49:16.586 --> 00:49:18.868]  This is high-tech book burning, folks.
[00:49:20.569 --> 00:49:33.056]  Now, when you try to give sixth graders a book about if your neighbor wants to have sex with you in a tool shed, it actually is in one of the books, go ahead, it's fun, let the man have sex with you.
[00:49:34.414 --> 00:49:36.096]  So it's priming kids to be molested.
[00:49:36.917 --> 00:49:37.898]  That's the stuff.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:44.565]  Now, us saying that's not in a children's library is not burning that book.
[00:49:46.347 --> 00:49:47.108]  The pedophile book.
[00:49:47.348 --> 00:49:48.229]  The pro-pedophile book.
[00:49:48.449 --> 00:49:49.050]  The grooming book.
[00:49:49.671 --> 00:49:51.893]  There's dozens of them that we know of that they have in the schools.
[00:49:52.734 --> 00:49:53.895]  Our own reporter, Christy Lee.
[00:49:54.758 --> 00:49:55.999]  She's been out because she had a baby.
[00:49:56.039 --> 00:49:56.719]  She'll be back soon.
[00:49:56.759 --> 00:49:57.200]  Great lady.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:03.884]  She's got five kids now, but one of them's in seventh grade here in Austin.
[00:50:04.484 --> 00:50:10.708]  And that book about how great it is to be molested is in the damn school.
[00:50:11.048 --> 00:50:20.174]  And it has graphics in it, lifelike cartoons of children being raped and enjoying it.
[00:50:20.194 --> 00:50:23.536]  It's like Oprah Winfrey said, oh, kids love to be molested.
[00:50:23.617 --> 00:50:24.077]  No, they don't.
[00:50:26.334 --> 00:50:27.895]  So that's the pedophile mindset.
[00:50:28.835 --> 00:50:30.696]  And Winfrey admits she was abused as a child.
[00:50:31.957 --> 00:50:36.519]  So they turn them into these, people that are abused get turned into these monsters, like a vampire bites you.
[00:50:36.859 --> 00:50:37.480]  That's the metaphor.
[00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:39.321]  Some of them turn into that.
[00:50:40.361 --> 00:50:44.403]  So they spin that Republicans want to ban books.
[00:50:45.404 --> 00:50:45.644]  No.
[00:50:46.884 --> 00:50:49.666]  As long as it's not real children getting raped, you can put your book out.
[00:50:50.287 --> 00:50:52.109]  You're disgusting, you're gross, you're evil.
[00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:53.831]  But no, you're not going to show it to kids.
[00:50:54.332 --> 00:51:00.760]   But meanwhile, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.' 's book, The Real Anthony Fauci, well that's in the documents, they had it suppressed.
[00:51:02.182 --> 00:51:04.444]  Didn't really work, I think it sold like 3 million copies.
[00:51:04.925 --> 00:51:13.125]   Continuing, WEF panelists suggest creating exclusion lists To demonetize sources sharing disinformation.
[00:51:13.165 --> 00:51:16.607]  And that's directly from the World Economic Forum that ended two weeks ago.
[00:51:17.087 --> 00:51:18.088]  And we've got the videos.
[00:51:18.128 --> 00:51:25.391]  They got up in the panel and they said, we will demonetize and go after your bank accounts of anybody that disagrees with anything we say.
[00:51:26.331 --> 00:51:28.252]  On global warming, you name it.
[00:51:28.272 --> 00:51:29.233]  There's an article boiling it down.
[00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:34.235]  WEF orders government to demonetize citizens who believe in conspiracy theories.
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:47.369]  So if we actually read what you say about world government, we will eat bugs, and the UN officially is trying to legalize pedophilia and forced euthanasia, which is government murder, we're going to censor you.
[00:51:47.809 --> 00:51:49.210]  And on the list, it's hundreds of things.
[00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:51.332]  Did you criticize the Afghan withdrawal?
[00:51:51.732 --> 00:51:52.933]  Did you criticize the border?
[00:51:52.953 --> 00:51:54.154]  Did you criticize the lockdown?
[00:51:54.414 --> 00:51:55.875]  Did you criticize the vaccine?
[00:51:56.175 --> 00:51:57.836]  Did you criticize Black Lives Matter?
[00:51:58.076 --> 00:51:59.517]  Did you criticize transgenders?
[00:51:59.778 --> 00:52:00.598]  Did you criticize?
[00:52:02.159 --> 00:52:02.880]  Did you criticize?
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:04.541]  And then they just bloop!
[00:52:05.848 --> 00:52:14.075]  Demonetize you, shadow ban you, outright ban you, take your bank account, have the CIA rig courts against you, and that's what happened to me.
[00:52:14.135 --> 00:52:15.556]  We now know that happened.
[00:52:17.618 --> 00:52:19.199]  And everybody's like, wow, we feel sorry for you.
[00:52:19.219 --> 00:52:22.242]  I'm like, you better feel sorry for yourself, because they're coming after your ass next.
[00:52:23.803 --> 00:52:25.384]  They just take out the lead elephant, folks.
[00:52:26.125 --> 00:52:27.967]  But we're still kicking because of you supporting us.
[00:52:28.447 --> 00:52:29.268]  All right, I'm going to come back.
[00:52:30.759 --> 00:52:32.320]  We're going to air a special report that needs to be seen.
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:36.384]  We're going to get Michael Young in here, and I'm glad he brought Doc Chambers with him.
[00:52:37.425 --> 00:52:39.587]  And then, by the way guys, give me Doc's bio.
[00:52:39.607 --> 00:52:41.429]  I know a lot about him, but I need the bio.
[00:52:41.569 --> 00:52:43.971]  So I'm glad he brought him along.
[00:52:43.991 --> 00:52:46.894]  I was excited to see him as I was already trying to get him on the show.
[00:52:46.914 --> 00:52:48.475]  Big success with their border operation.
[00:52:48.515 --> 00:52:49.476]  Blew up in the left's face.
[00:52:49.776 --> 00:52:50.237]  Beautiful.
[00:52:50.717 --> 00:52:52.559]  Got a lot of inside stuff that happened.
[00:52:52.599 --> 00:52:54.120]  Provocateurs, they were able to stop.
[00:52:55.363 --> 00:53:01.965]  Some of these provocateurs, known leftist professors, went down there and announced that we were down there beating up migrants and attacking people.
[00:53:03.366 --> 00:53:07.167]  They were shooting videos saying that, hoping leftists would come down and attack people.
[00:53:07.307 --> 00:53:08.147]  I wasn't even there.
[00:53:08.587 --> 00:53:09.608]  My reporters were down there.
[00:53:10.028 --> 00:53:11.828]  But again, that's their tool, lying.
[00:53:12.809 --> 00:53:13.449]  We're going to go to break.
[00:53:14.366 --> 00:53:19.751]  But folks, we're standing up for our rights, we're standing up for your rights, we're standing up for all of our freedoms and our children.
[00:53:19.951 --> 00:53:28.739]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at InfoWarsTore.com, then I'm not griping at you, I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:33.102]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:53:33.999 --> 00:53:40.986]  If just a half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our right supplements and then reorder them because they really work.
[00:53:41.306 --> 00:53:41.907]  Just try it.
[00:53:42.508 --> 00:53:44.430]  We would be able to do so many things.
[00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:48.594]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.
[00:53:49.134 --> 00:53:55.749]   Infowarsstore.com It's been sold out, it's back in stock, reformulated even stronger.

[00:53:58.875 --> 00:53:59.957]  Vasodilation.

[00:54:03.465 --> 00:54:04.206]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:54:05.043 --> 00:54:05.824]  Especially for men.

[00:55:52.545 --> 00:55:58.970]  We pledge this plan to destroy the Americans, to save their economy, and their people, and their border, and their military.
[00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:00.091]  Hail Putin!
[00:56:00.271 --> 00:56:01.091]  Hail Russia!
[00:56:01.272 --> 00:56:02.432]  We will never surrender!
[00:56:04.994 --> 00:56:06.015]  Yes!
[00:56:07.176 --> 00:56:07.456]  Yes!
[00:56:07.556 --> 00:56:09.037]  That is the KGB plan!
[00:56:09.377 --> 00:56:10.278]  Ha-ha-ha!
[00:56:10.298 --> 00:56:11.239]  Well done, Comrade!
[00:56:11.319 --> 00:56:12.820]  Ha-ha-ha!
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:14.101]  We're still the Americans!
[00:56:18.643 --> 00:56:19.643]  If you do it, keep the oil.
[00:56:19.743 --> 00:56:21.604]  Would you still send aid to Israel right now?
[00:56:22.345 --> 00:56:24.846]  Look, we've always got to protect Israel, in my opinion.
[00:56:25.086 --> 00:56:28.647]  They've been, you know, they're amazing people, what they've done.
[00:56:29.068 --> 00:56:31.969]  It's an amazing thing, and they've been loyal to us.
[00:56:32.049 --> 00:56:34.110]  Mr. President, when will you announce who your VP is?
[00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:35.610]  Not for a while.
[00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:39.092]  We have so many great people in the Republican Party, but not for a while.
[00:56:39.454 --> 00:56:42.475]  What criteria are you using to identify who your running mate is?
[00:56:42.756 --> 00:56:44.136]  Always, it's gotta be one thing.
[00:56:44.196 --> 00:56:45.677]  It's gotta be who would be a good president.
[00:56:45.757 --> 00:56:49.739]  I mean, you always have to think that because, you know, in case of emergency, things happen, right?
[00:56:49.859 --> 00:56:51.280]  No matter who you are, things happen.
[00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:52.620]  It's gotta be number one.
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:53.521]  Who is your running mate?
[00:56:54.141 --> 00:56:55.302]  Well, I have a lot of good people.
[00:56:55.402 --> 00:56:56.662]  We have a lot of really good people.
[00:56:56.682 --> 00:56:57.743]  So you haven't decided who it is?
[00:56:58.613 --> 00:57:02.034]  I have a lot of good ideas, but I haven't, and there's no reason to do that quickly.
[00:57:02.054 --> 00:57:03.914]  So you haven't told that person, you're my person?
[00:57:04.054 --> 00:57:04.954]  I speak to everybody.
[00:57:05.274 --> 00:57:06.155]  I speak to everybody.
[00:57:06.735 --> 00:57:09.755]  You know, I called Tim Scott this week, because a lot of people like Tim Scott.
[00:57:09.835 --> 00:57:14.456]  I called him and I said, you're a much better candidate for me than you are for yourself.
[00:57:15.116 --> 00:57:19.337]  When I watched Tim, he was fine, he was good, but he was very low-key, etc., etc.
[00:57:19.737 --> 00:57:23.918]  I watched him in the last week, defending me and sticking up for me and fighting for me.
[00:57:24.338 --> 00:57:35.161]   I said, man, you're a much better Person for me than you are for yourself because for himself he was low-key for me He's been he's been a real tiger.
[00:57:35.461 --> 00:57:40.322]  He's been incredible and others have to So maybe it's Tim Scott.
[00:57:41.022 --> 00:57:44.043]  What could be it could be a lot of people but it was interesting.
[00:57:44.063 --> 00:57:46.823]  I was watching Tim I've been watching, you know for a while.
[00:57:46.903 --> 00:57:58.910]   I watched him campaign as a candidate But I watched him over the last two weeks as you know, he endorsed me fully endorsed me gave me a beautiful endorsement and And he has been really strong in terms of that.
[00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:04.173]  No, but that has nothing to do... I don't want anybody to take even any inference, but it's incredible.
[00:58:04.753 --> 00:58:07.975]  Kristi Noem has been incredible fighting for me.
[00:58:08.055 --> 00:58:10.357]  She said, I'd never run against him because I can't beat him.
[00:58:10.677 --> 00:58:12.058]  That was a very nice thing to say.
[00:58:12.078 --> 00:58:14.880]  What was the story that your team reached out to RFK Jr.? ?
[00:58:15.925 --> 00:58:16.705]  It's a false story, no.
[00:58:16.725 --> 00:58:17.245]  It's a false story.
[00:58:17.285 --> 00:58:18.186]  You never reached out to RFK?
[00:58:18.206 --> 00:58:19.026]  You know what, I like him a lot.
[00:58:19.066 --> 00:58:20.707]  Nope, never, never happened.
[00:58:20.907 --> 00:58:25.828]  Is it fair to believe that you would have a number of your former officials in your new cabinet?
[00:58:25.948 --> 00:58:27.168]  I will put some back, I'll tell you.
[00:58:27.709 --> 00:58:27.989]  You did.
[00:58:28.109 --> 00:58:29.429]  I want to go back to immigration.
[00:58:29.909 --> 00:58:38.652]  Walk us through your plan for immigration, because is it as easy as going back to the security that you had in place, like the remain in Mexico and all these other things that Joe Biden overturned?
[00:58:39.472 --> 00:58:43.694]  There are 8 to 10 million illegals in the country right now on Joe Biden's watch.
[00:58:43.774 --> 00:58:44.854]  So what do you do with them?
[00:58:44.994 --> 00:58:45.874]  Are you going to deport them all?
[00:58:45.894 --> 00:58:46.274]  What's the plan?
[00:58:46.294 --> 00:58:47.554]  Well, you're going to have to deport a lot of them.
[00:58:47.875 --> 00:58:48.935]  It's not sustainable.
[00:58:49.655 --> 00:58:52.075]  And now you look, look, these countries are very smart.
[00:58:52.095 --> 00:58:54.956]  I know every one of the leaders of the countries for the most part.
[00:58:56.136 --> 00:58:58.416]  The presidents, the dictators, I know them all.
[00:58:58.616 --> 00:59:00.277]  I know the kings, the queens, I know them all.
[00:59:00.817 --> 00:59:01.717]  These are smart people.
[00:59:01.777 --> 00:59:02.957]  These are streetwise people.
[00:59:03.517 --> 00:59:08.198]  It makes sense that they're taking people out and sending them up in caravans to the United States.
[00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:09.618]  And it's not just South America.
[00:59:09.638 --> 00:59:12.159]  It's from Africa, from Asia, from all over the world.
[00:59:12.179 --> 00:59:12.799]  And China.
[00:59:12.819 --> 00:59:13.079]  Asia.
[00:59:13.519 --> 00:59:14.680]  I mean, from all over the world.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:18.362]  From China, they had 28,000 people in the last few months.
[00:59:18.382 --> 00:59:18.362]  28,000!
[00:59:18.682 --> 00:59:19.162]  What's he doing?
[00:59:19.202 --> 00:59:19.843]  Building an army?
[00:59:19.863 --> 00:59:23.965]  And they were mostly men, almost all men, from the age of 18 to 25.
[00:59:24.505 --> 00:59:25.366]  So what's that all about?
[00:59:25.446 --> 00:59:27.307]  But are you talking about mass deportation?
[00:59:27.407 --> 00:59:29.608]  What do you do with the 8 to 10 million people already here?
[00:59:29.668 --> 00:59:34.471]  Okay, Dwight Eisenhower, believe it or not, you don't think of him as being a tough president or a great president.
[00:59:34.491 --> 00:59:35.871]  He was actually a very good president.
[00:59:35.911 --> 00:59:40.134]  He was very strong on deportation because a lot of people were coming into our country illegally.
[00:59:41.038 --> 00:59:43.160]  And he started a big mass deportation.
[00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:46.102]  He dropped them very close to the border and they came back.
[00:59:46.402 --> 00:59:48.924]  Then he dropped them 2,000 miles away and they didn't come back.
[00:59:49.765 --> 00:59:59.612]  We cannot allow scenes like I saw in New York two days ago where policemen are being beat up by gangs of illegal immigrants, in that case from Venezuela, Honduras.
[01:00:00.393 --> 01:00:01.233]  We can't allow that.
[01:00:01.294 --> 01:00:02.474]  And these are kids that are fighters.
[01:00:02.514 --> 01:00:03.795]  They were not, you know, babies.
[01:00:03.835 --> 01:00:06.476]  They were knocking the hell out of our policemen.
[01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:08.297]  We can't let this happen.
[01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:09.738]  These are tough people.
[01:00:10.238 --> 01:00:12.720]  So the heads of these countries are smart.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.262]  They're not sending the people that are doing a great job and that they love in the country.
[01:00:17.642 --> 01:00:20.484]  They're sending people, for the most part, that they don't want.
[01:00:20.564 --> 01:00:22.065]  And they're putting them into caravans.
[01:00:26.167 --> 01:00:27.888]  And then Michael Yohn's studio with huge news.
[01:00:28.348 --> 01:00:35.470]  Well, Michael Yohn was a Green Beret stationed around the world, also an expert on Russia and trained to fight a war with Russia.
[01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:40.792]  And he's the preeminent wartime correspondent around the world.
[01:00:40.832 --> 01:00:44.434]  So when he's in our country, that means America is under attack.
[01:00:44.494 --> 01:00:48.475]  And folks, when we say the globalists are the enemy, the Democratic Party is totally captured.
[01:00:49.115 --> 01:00:50.796]  They are literally dissolving our border.
[01:00:50.816 --> 01:00:51.996]  They are literally invading us.
[01:00:52.016 --> 01:00:53.337]  They're literally starting World War III.
[01:00:53.977 --> 01:00:59.700]  They're destroying our currency, they are defunding the police, they are at war with us.
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:03.162]  So let's stop mincing words here.
[01:01:03.522 --> 01:01:07.985]  When Trump says the mainstream media is the enemy of the people, they literally are at war with us.
[01:01:08.005 --> 01:01:09.346]  I have a great example of this real fast.
[01:01:10.866 --> 01:01:17.170]  Two weeks ago, liquefied natural gas, Biden bans the U.S.
[01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:17.730]  exporting it.
[01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:19.711]  What's the main state that exports like 70% of it?
[01:01:21.516 --> 01:01:23.899]  And he said, this is to punish Texas, as people did.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:34.390]  Now, he comes out yesterday and signs an order to sell our coal, that he won't allow to be burned here, to India to build factories there.
[01:01:35.506 --> 01:01:39.147]  We got articles up on Infowars.com that deal with all of that.
[01:01:39.687 --> 01:01:40.967]  So that's strategic.
[01:01:41.507 --> 01:01:45.668]  Energy is the food of the machines and the infrastructure that feeds us.
[01:01:46.188 --> 01:01:47.508]  So it's just like cutting food off.
[01:01:47.528 --> 01:01:48.609]  They're cutting the farmers off.
[01:01:49.389 --> 01:01:55.610]  Michael Yan's done a lot of reporting in the last few years, in the last few months, in the Netherlands.
[01:01:55.750 --> 01:02:04.492]  Now the trucking and farming protests have spread all over Europe because they're literally saying we're cutting off your fuel.
[01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:10.154]  We're putting more taxes on you, and we're cutting off your fertilizer.
[01:02:10.455 --> 01:02:17.001]  They are cutting the food off, they are cutting the energy off, and saying business is only open in China and India.
[01:02:17.021 --> 01:02:18.503]  And I'm not against the Indians, folks.
[01:02:19.124 --> 01:02:21.566]  And I'm not against the Chinese people, but this is beyond treason.
[01:02:21.786 --> 01:02:24.209]  And the average person doesn't think, where's power come from?
[01:02:24.229 --> 01:02:25.490]  You just flip a light switch.
[01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:26.051]  No, it doesn't.
[01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:29.410]  Around 70% of our power still comes from coal.
[01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:32.512]  They lie and say it's from wind, but you study the numbers, that's not true.
[01:02:32.892 --> 01:02:38.436]  We are being shut down where you can't come here to manufacture because there isn't cheap energy.
[01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:45.180]  So Michael Young, I've got to say, and I'm glad that Doc Chambers is here as well, he'll be popping in with us in about 20 minutes.
[01:02:46.502 --> 01:02:47.623]  That you've had a great success.
[01:02:47.664 --> 01:02:54.712]  You've been down at the Darien Gap for years, where the Chinese and the UN are building their giant refugee camps, their invasion camps.
[01:02:55.033 --> 01:03:02.241]  You're showing the bridges, you're showing the maps, and you just hammer it and hammer it and hammer it on my show, your show, and other shows.
[01:03:02.802 --> 01:03:04.885]  Finally, in the last month, you've had a major breakthrough.
[01:03:05.485 --> 01:03:20.913]  It's all over Fox, it's all over Tucker, the people you brought to Darien Gap, it is all over the news, it is in congressional hearings, they're talking about the NGOs, the new border bill gives $2.3 billion to NGOs to accelerate the invasion, everybody's talking about the UN.
[01:03:21.773 --> 01:03:31.602]  Six years ago, or five years ago, when Lou Dobbs got fired from Fox Business, he simply showed mainstream documents, mainstream news, reporting on Soros getting U.S.
[01:03:31.622 --> 01:03:35.666]  taxpayer money to give them debit cards and the NGOs to give them billions.
[01:03:36.206 --> 01:03:37.668]  So they were really scared of this.
[01:03:37.828 --> 01:03:42.152]  Now this is out in the open, and now the defunding is out in the open strategically.
[01:03:42.172 --> 01:03:46.516]  I know you're not about praise, but it's an example of success for everybody else out there watching.
[01:03:47.176 --> 01:03:51.738]  You've been down there for years and the people backing you have really been on the right horse.
[01:03:52.258 --> 01:03:58.780]  You have won a major strategic victory in the awakening process to cut off the funds.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.061]  You've got to feel really some satisfaction right now.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:03.821]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:04.762]  Yeah, I just got back.
[01:04:04.822 --> 01:04:08.866]  I just took our team, Operation Burning Edge, just with Ann VanderSteel.
[01:04:08.906 --> 01:04:13.550]  We just took Brett Weinstein and Dr. Chris Martinson down to the Dairy and Gap.
[01:04:14.611 --> 01:04:18.215]  And then we took, well, Ann VanderSteel was there, Masako Kanaha from Japan.
[01:04:18.715 --> 01:04:21.338]  And this has now reached millions of viewers.
[01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:24.842]  Just the Tucker interview with Brett Weinstein hit at least 9 million now.
[01:04:25.622 --> 01:04:27.544]  And so that was a major awakening.
[01:04:27.604 --> 01:04:32.588]  It was actually great to take Brett Weinstein down there and Dr. Chris Martinson.
[01:04:33.609 --> 01:04:36.811]  And, you know, we had them down for almost a week.
[01:04:37.292 --> 01:04:39.934]  And so the learning experience was quite intense for them.
[01:04:40.294 --> 01:04:41.816]  And I think that they were quite surprised.
[01:04:41.856 --> 01:04:45.619]  Just watch Brett's interview with Tucker Carlson.
[01:04:45.659 --> 01:04:48.881]  Now, interestingly, you were just talking about LNG, the liquefied natural gas.
[01:04:49.702 --> 01:04:51.923]  Natural gas is something we've talked about quite a lot.
[01:04:52.003 --> 01:05:01.769]  Now, when we talk about the flows of the aliens coming through, the demographic warfare, the weaponized migration, that's all part of something much larger, as you talk about all the time, Alex.
[01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:04.191]  For instance, the energy and the fertilizers, right?
[01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:07.393]  Fertilizer and energy is something I talk about a lot.
[01:05:08.413 --> 01:05:12.494]  The natural gas, last year in March, I was at the Dutch elections.
[01:05:13.275 --> 01:05:18.996]  In fact, I had just left Panama and went straight to Netherlands, because Netherlands is another vital terrain.
[01:05:19.757 --> 01:05:24.878]  I was at Groningen gas fields, which is the biggest gas fields in Europe, actually.
[01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:30.200]  And I was warning, due to information war, they might close the Groningen gas fields.
[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:31.960]  Uh, and now they have.
[01:05:32.161 --> 01:05:36.662]  Now, when I reported that last March, uh, uh, that- It sounded crazy.
[01:05:36.942 --> 01:05:40.303]  Yeah, because you gotta keep in mind- Oh, they're turning the lights off.
[01:05:40.944 --> 01:05:42.444]  It just takes time for you to figure it out.
[01:05:42.644 --> 01:05:46.125]  The flash to bang can be quite long on, for instance, the natural gas.
[01:05:46.165 --> 01:05:49.386]  Keep in mind with the natural gas, it's more than just keeping your water warm.
[01:05:49.707 --> 01:05:50.827]  It's also fertilizer.
[01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:59.069]  In the Haber-Bosch process, in which you take the natural gas and you remove the hydrogen and you combine it with the nitrogen that we breathe, you make ammonia, right?
[01:05:59.669 --> 01:06:03.330]  Nitrogenous fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and that sort of thing.
[01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:09.091]  So they've turned off the second largest food producing country in the world is the Netherlands.
[01:06:09.111 --> 01:06:09.771]  They're geniuses.
[01:06:09.811 --> 01:06:12.731]  They're the central green thumb.
[01:06:13.032 --> 01:06:14.952]  They literally are cutting off the main food.
[01:06:15.652 --> 01:06:16.173]  Absolutely.
[01:06:16.653 --> 01:06:17.734]  And Germany as well.
[01:06:17.834 --> 01:06:20.336]  And in Germany they talk about, you know, carbon dioxide.
[01:06:20.657 --> 01:06:24.340]  In Netherlands it's about stikstoff, which is nitrogen, right?
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:30.826]  So they custom make these information campaigns depending on the demographic and how it will sell.
[01:06:30.846 --> 01:06:34.769]  A lot of people don't realize, they're not just cutting off farmers, they're cutting off fishermen as well.
[01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:38.733]  For instance, in Netherlands I was out with fishermen... Well, when you cut off farmers, you cut yourself off.
[01:06:39.193 --> 01:06:39.774]  Absolutely.
[01:06:40.034 --> 01:06:45.778]  And you'll put the control in the hands of people like Bill Gates, who is openly, openly, he doesn't hide what he's doing.
[01:06:45.798 --> 01:06:48.981]  He's trying to get as much control over the food supply as possible.
[01:06:49.301 --> 01:06:49.981]  He's just one.
[01:06:50.302 --> 01:06:52.804]  Keep in mind, the World Economic Forum... Tycoms are buying it all up?
[01:06:53.424 --> 01:06:53.684]  Oh yeah.
[01:06:54.065 --> 01:07:06.354]  Now, keep in mind, now, as they shut off the food supplies, bit by bit, keep in mind, again, there's a long flash to bang between the, you know, reduction of the nitrogenous fertilizer production, the food prices going up... He used a military term.
[01:07:06.514 --> 01:07:07.175]  Long fuse.
[01:07:07.475 --> 01:07:08.456]  Right, exactly.
[01:07:08.736 --> 01:07:15.822]  So the human osmotic pressure, the HOP, the human osmotic pressure is the push and the pull of migration.
[01:07:16.222 --> 01:07:23.368]  Now as food prices go up, food shortages increase, and other pressures, positive pressures increase, that causes people to move.
[01:07:23.768 --> 01:07:32.775]  Meanwhile, you've got the NGOs, many, more than 250, who are facilitating the invasions of Europe and the United States.
[01:07:32.795 --> 01:07:35.658]  And don't you love Elon calling for their arrest because they are human trafficking.
[01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:38.099]  And Biden can't waive a law on that.
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:39.660]  All right.
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:46.724]  You know, one of the reasons Operation Burning Edge spent so much time at SpaceX last year was to specifically to spur Elon.
[01:07:46.744 --> 01:07:48.265]  We didn't even ask to talk with him.
[01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:54.549]  We didn't ask to talk with any of the... I'm very pro SpaceX, by the way, and I have been since the inception.
[01:07:54.929 --> 01:08:01.413]  But we went to SpaceX, spent two or three weeks down there showing how the aliens are coming across the border at Boca Chica.
[01:08:01.713 --> 01:08:07.157]  Which they come right across the Rio Grande, right there, and then you saw Elon Musk start paying attention to the border.
[01:08:07.518 --> 01:08:10.960]  I will chalk that up as another success of Operation Burning Man.
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:11.541]  Oh, there's no doubt.
[01:08:11.561 --> 01:08:12.161]  You're a genius.
[01:08:12.962 --> 01:08:14.143]  I'm doing what you do, basically.
[01:08:14.203 --> 01:08:15.043]  Force-multiplying.
[01:08:15.304 --> 01:08:17.906]  You know, you're one of the few people that get what I'm doing, actually.
[01:08:17.966 --> 01:08:26.672]  I had Anthony Rubin on your show last year, and you said, and I was sitting beside Anthony Rubin, and you said, you're force-multiplying, Michael.
[01:08:26.712 --> 01:08:27.333]  Something like that.
[01:08:27.853 --> 01:08:28.334]  Exactly.
[01:08:28.634 --> 01:08:29.655]  That's what we have to do.
[01:08:29.735 --> 01:08:34.225]   Well, I was never in the military, but I did get really interested in politics and how to defeat the
[01:08:34.225 --> 01:08:38.675]   globalists. So when I was at like 20 I started reading all the books about resistance
[01:08:38.675 --> 01:08:42.965]   movements both from the West and communists and others and like things
[01:08:42.965 --> 01:08:47.675]   like total resistance and it's all right there that's what we need. We have to
[01:08:47.675 --> 01:08:50.015]  force multiply.
[01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:51.721]  We have to, you know, put your ego into a box.
[01:08:51.741 --> 01:08:58.006]  You have to have a strong ego to attack the way we do, to fight every day, to wake up and go to bed in the game.
[01:08:58.406 --> 01:09:01.868]  But you also... You externalize your ego onto humanity.
[01:09:02.208 --> 01:09:02.809]  Exactly.
[01:09:03.109 --> 01:09:04.590]  You need to do exactly what you do.
[01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:07.312]  For instance, you're always giving the microphone to other people.
[01:09:07.672 --> 01:09:10.514]  You know, when I say, hey, can you have so and so on, you immediately do it.
[01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:11.895]  It's extremely helpful.
[01:09:12.175 --> 01:09:16.418]  Like, for instance, now there's some or you have a lot of Orthodox Jews watch your show, by the way.
[01:09:17.579 --> 01:09:31.176]  And some really would like to get on the microphone and talk about some of the things that are going on, for instance, with HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, of which Mayorkas, Alex Mayorkas, used to be a board member on HIAS.
[01:09:31.256 --> 01:09:33.239]  And the Jews are worried about all the Islamists they're bringing in.
[01:09:33.579 --> 01:09:34.560]  Oh yeah, big time.
[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:37.984]  The real Jews, the Orthodox Jews, they'll be watching right now.
[01:09:38.004 --> 01:09:39.967]  They'll be sending me a hundred messages when I get off.
[01:09:40.467 --> 01:09:44.552]  And they really want to put a kibosh on HIAS.
[01:09:45.493 --> 01:09:50.619]  Keep in mind there's Catholic Charities, Lutheran Immigrants, Refugee Immigrant Services, and all these others.
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:51.560]  That's a good question.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.461]  What's the biggest NGO?
[01:09:52.502 --> 01:09:53.543]  You're saying it's the Jewish one.
[01:09:54.383 --> 01:10:00.267]  The biggest one would be IOM, the International Organization for Migration.
[01:10:00.568 --> 01:10:01.808]  That's the umbrella group.
[01:10:02.029 --> 01:10:04.730]  Right, that's the main engine room, you might say.
[01:10:04.770 --> 01:10:06.491]  I mean, of the little front groups.
[01:10:07.432 --> 01:10:11.315]  Arguably, it might be Catholic Charities, but it's hard to figure this out.
[01:10:11.395 --> 01:10:16.158]  We work on it all the time, but HIAS is quite huge, and HIAS is quite influential.
[01:10:16.618 --> 01:10:21.622]  Keep in mind, Mayorkas, Alex Mayorkas, was a Cuban refugee himself.
[01:10:24.563 --> 01:10:25.203]  Oh, big time.
[01:10:25.604 --> 01:10:29.625]  And, you know, the other day he threw the Holocaust card during his impeachment hearings and whatnot.
[01:10:29.965 --> 01:10:35.286]  You know, the bottom line is all of us came from families who have been in pandemic, famine, wars, and genocides.
[01:10:35.426 --> 01:10:40.028]  Every single buddy watching... Everybody on earth is now a victim of a bio-attack with COVID.
[01:10:41.408 --> 01:10:44.230]  I'm as big a victim as you is, Mayorkas, so stick it up your ass.
[01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:45.690]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:10:45.730 --> 01:10:46.291]  Thank you, sir.
[01:10:46.711 --> 01:10:57.197]  And Mayorkas, keep in mind, if you go to HIAS.org, Mayorkas, they congratulate, you know, Mayorkas was a board member on HIAS.
[01:10:57.697 --> 01:11:05.900]  And their camp down in Darien Province in Panama is about 40 yards away from the main gate of China Camp.
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:07.160]  I'm down there all the time.
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:11.022]  I was just down there three weeks ago with Brett Weinstein and Chris Martenson.
[01:11:11.322 --> 01:11:24.691]   By the way, to interrupt you, I love the national media picked up when you were in Dripping Springs week before you guys went down to the super successful You know, a convoy, a caravan, and they spun it like you were anti-Semitic because you were telling the whole story.
[01:11:24.711 --> 01:11:30.658]  They took out a context of Orthodox Jews, see massive Islamists, Hezbollah, Hamas being brought in.
[01:11:30.698 --> 01:11:33.621]  They're concerned about Jewish charities being used for that.
[01:11:33.941 --> 01:11:36.284]  You were saying, look out Jews, this is happening.
[01:11:36.324 --> 01:11:37.846]  They spun that that you're anti-Jew.
[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:46.787]  Oh, exactly, because I'm saying, like with Catholic Charities, if the Pope doesn't denounce, eventually doesn't denounce Catholic Charities, eventually he's just accepting ownership, right?
[01:11:47.288 --> 01:11:48.809]  And it's the same with HIAS.
[01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:54.294]  If you look on HIAS.org, you'll see a long list of people that are donors to HIAS, right?
[01:11:54.594 --> 01:11:55.755]  Ben Shapiro is on there.
[01:11:56.276 --> 01:11:58.818]  I'm not saying it's the Ben Shapiro of Daily Wire.
[01:11:58.858 --> 01:11:59.879]  He has denied that.
[01:12:00.299 --> 01:12:06.321]  But, there are nine Shapiros on there, and you can see many different names on there, Pritzker and whatnot.
[01:12:06.881 --> 01:12:14.063]  Why are they openly donating to HIAS, who is Hezbollah's coming through the border every single day, right?
[01:12:14.323 --> 01:12:20.965]  There is a huge... Listen, in 1994, there was a Hezbollah bombing in Panama that killed about 12 Jews.
[01:12:21.005 --> 01:12:24.326]  I just had lunch with one of the family members a couple months ago in Panama.
[01:12:24.646 --> 01:12:25.747]  Let me ask you that.
[01:12:28.112 --> 01:12:34.414]  Brett Weinstein, really smart guy, said, you're right, told Tucker, this is a military invasion, Chinese military age males.
[01:12:34.774 --> 01:12:36.455]  What are they planning with all these sleeper cells?
[01:12:37.215 --> 01:12:38.436]  Well, there's different ecosystems.
[01:12:38.496 --> 01:12:42.637]  Of course, China, you know, again, I've written three books on Chinese information war.
[01:12:42.677 --> 01:12:44.438]  Unfortunately, they're only in Japanese.
[01:12:44.458 --> 01:12:47.879]  They're not in English because I've been working to wake up Japan for years.
[01:12:48.339 --> 01:12:50.620]  But different ecosystems have different goals.
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:52.841]  Some are just coming in like Planet of the Apes.
[01:12:52.941 --> 01:12:53.581]  It's free stuff.
[01:12:53.621 --> 01:12:54.442]  Let's go to America.
[01:12:54.582 --> 01:12:55.062]  That's some.
[01:12:55.442 --> 01:12:55.582]  Right?
[01:12:55.622 --> 01:12:57.224]  There are others like the Chinese.
[01:12:57.585 --> 01:13:00.288]  I've been studying them for years in and around China.
[01:13:00.308 --> 01:13:02.010]  I spent about a year in and around China.
[01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:03.051]  I've been up to Tibet.
[01:13:03.452 --> 01:13:05.595]  I saw how they became Tibet.
[01:13:05.835 --> 01:13:08.038]  They didn't just, you know, militarily take it.
[01:13:08.238 --> 01:13:09.199]  They became Tibet.
[01:13:09.379 --> 01:13:10.501]  They did the same with Hong Kong.
[01:13:10.521 --> 01:13:12.283]  They forced the Tibetan women to marry Chinese.
[01:13:12.603 --> 01:13:14.345]  Oh yeah, and they did the same with Hong Kong.
[01:13:14.365 --> 01:13:18.149]  For instance, I was in Hong Kong for seven months until they kicked me out in 2020, right?
[01:13:18.449 --> 01:13:20.631]  You can see them putting me on the airplane and shutting the door.
[01:13:20.651 --> 01:13:22.553]  So, you know, Google it, right?
[01:13:22.633 --> 01:13:23.954]  Or web search it, let's say.
[01:13:24.635 --> 01:13:25.896]  But what did they do to Hong Kong?
[01:13:26.096 --> 01:13:29.980]   They took Hong Kong, dripped Drip, drip, demographic warfare.
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:39.807]  They were bringing in mainland Chinese every day at a rate that nobody really got crazy about, but at a rate that they ended up taking over the professorships.
[01:13:40.188 --> 01:13:42.469]  They became school teachers teaching history.
[01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:44.751]  They became policemen and politicians.
[01:13:45.132 --> 01:13:46.933]  The normal who's who in the zoo.
[01:13:46.973 --> 01:13:48.034]  Classic infiltration.
[01:13:48.354 --> 01:13:52.157]  Yep, and they did it with Hong Kong, and they're doing it right now with Taiwan.
[01:13:52.497 --> 01:14:07.888]  And I'm telling you, just a few months ago I was in Belize, I met with a Taiwanese ambassador there with Masako Kanaha, I was interviewing her, and you can see bit by bit that Taiwan is being edged out everywhere, right?
[01:14:10.810 --> 01:14:20.337]  Here's an interesting aside, or it's related, IOM, the International Organization for Migration, they are the huge engine of the invasion, right?
[01:14:20.717 --> 01:14:27.381]  They have taken over the number one office space in Panama, in the City of Knowledge, which used to be Fort Clayton, the U.S.
[01:14:27.462 --> 01:14:28.742]  Army South Headquarters.
[01:14:28.762 --> 01:14:29.283]  So this U.N.
[01:14:29.343 --> 01:14:31.844]  CHICOM thing is taking over our military base.
[01:14:32.045 --> 01:14:32.265]  Right.
[01:14:32.345 --> 01:14:38.389]  The three major donors of IOM are United States, that's number one, number two is Germany, number three is Canada.
[01:14:38.749 --> 01:14:50.412]  Now, in Guatemala, I'm sorry, in Honduras, the IOM is now sharing the office space with the Canadian Embassy, right?
[01:14:51.752 --> 01:14:54.853]  You're great at giving us all the details, but you've done your job now.
[01:14:54.933 --> 01:14:56.033]  People know there's U.N.
[01:14:56.093 --> 01:14:57.393]  camps, they know we're funding it.
[01:14:57.994 --> 01:14:59.954]  Now we've got to move to cut the funding.
[01:14:59.994 --> 01:15:05.695]  Like this new bill, $2.3 billion to the NGOs, a lot of Republicans supporting it.
[01:15:06.015 --> 01:15:06.936]  This is so simple.
[01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:08.216]  Cut the damn funding off.
[01:15:08.616 --> 01:15:08.796]  Right.
[01:15:08.896 --> 01:15:11.319]  Cut the funding will be the first major hit.
[01:15:11.659 --> 01:15:14.242]  I mean, for instance, cutting the funding to all of you in.
[01:15:14.943 --> 01:15:17.625]  You know, years ago people... I say get the hell out of the whole thing.
[01:15:17.926 --> 01:15:19.387]  Yeah, totally out.
[01:15:19.968 --> 01:15:24.112]  Cut everything and start arresting people who are involved in the child trafficking.
[01:15:24.372 --> 01:15:26.375]  We know a lot of people- And the NGOs are!
[01:15:26.415 --> 01:15:28.618]  That's what I'm saying, the state police and others are looking at that.
[01:15:28.999 --> 01:15:31.803]  They can get them, because it doesn't matter if Biden says he can come through illegally.
[01:15:32.143 --> 01:15:36.710]  You're there with unaccompanied minors that are being trafficked to people, and all sorts of crimes are being committed.
[01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:41.817]   You start arresting a few of these people, they'll fold like a- Old Barn and a Tornado.
[01:15:42.137 --> 01:15:43.099]  Oh yeah, exactly.
[01:15:43.399 --> 01:15:44.661]  And we know a lot of their names.
[01:15:44.701 --> 01:15:46.063]  We know thousands of their names.
[01:15:46.824 --> 01:15:52.071]  I mean, they should be kicking down the doors in Texas of these facilities such as in Brownsville, the old Walmart.
[01:15:52.091 --> 01:15:54.454]  And you can get them on zoning.
[01:15:54.514 --> 01:15:56.397]  There's a thousand ways to skin this cat.
[01:15:56.978 --> 01:15:57.138]  Right.
[01:15:57.879 --> 01:16:00.060]  It just takes the will to do it and the guts.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.121]  That's all it takes.
[01:16:01.461 --> 01:16:03.122]  Because legally, we're in the right.
[01:16:03.182 --> 01:16:04.783]  They are clearly child trafficking.
[01:16:05.103 --> 01:16:07.144]  They are clearly taking people against their will.
[01:16:07.424 --> 01:16:12.867]  They are clearly in, for instance, in Brownsville, in the old Walmart store there that we've been to, right?
[01:16:13.167 --> 01:16:13.948]  We all know this.
[01:16:14.028 --> 01:16:17.170]  We have all kinds of statements from people that work there.
[01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:18.891]  We have names of people that work there.
[01:16:19.131 --> 01:16:19.991]  We have everything.
[01:16:20.351 --> 01:16:22.152]  And not just us, many people have it.
[01:16:22.192 --> 01:16:23.213]  Law enforcement has it.
[01:16:23.493 --> 01:16:24.854]  It's not like we're hoarding it.
[01:16:25.194 --> 01:16:36.748]  And I played a video yesterday that was sent to me by Border Patrol, and the Border Patrol starts crying because they've seen these kids before, they're begging for help, and they have to hand them over to the NGOs again and see them a month later.
[01:16:37.608 --> 01:16:38.069]  Exactly.
[01:16:39.150 --> 01:16:41.253]  Find that B-roll guys, throw that, I mean this is sick.
[01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:43.731]  I'm selling the crew, keep going.
[01:16:44.071 --> 01:16:44.651]  Okay, right.
[01:16:45.032 --> 01:16:48.514]  Yeah, and so this is happening openly and it happens all throughout the world.
[01:16:48.874 --> 01:16:54.157]  I mean, we see people coming in through the Darien Gap with children that don't look like they're even the same race.
[01:16:54.237 --> 01:16:56.478]  I mean, where do they even get these children, right?
[01:16:56.518 --> 01:16:58.840]  You know, like... Well, they use them as a golden ticket to get in.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:03.422]  Exactly, and in some cases we know they recycle children on the Mexico-U.S.
[01:17:03.882 --> 01:17:04.163]  border.
[01:17:04.483 --> 01:17:04.663]  Right?
[01:17:04.703 --> 01:17:07.965]  They'll literally use the child to get in, and recycle the child.
[01:17:07.985 --> 01:17:18.370]  That's what the Border Patrol was telling us, is why they're so freaked out, why they were giving us all this intel, is they said, now we see some of these kids every month, and they tell us, we've been raped, help us, and they can't, they're ordered to hand them over.
[01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:20.051]  The Border Patrol starts crying right here.
[01:17:20.231 --> 01:17:20.831]  This is the video.
[01:17:21.252 --> 01:17:21.612]  Keep going.
[01:17:22.892 --> 01:17:24.253]  Yeah, this is just over the top.
[01:17:24.273 --> 01:17:30.066]   I mean, this is, you know, We often, you know, I was stationed in Germany when I was in the army, in the U.S.
[01:17:30.166 --> 01:17:36.831]  Army, and we often wonder, how is it that these normal farmers and whatnot became these beasts that ran the camps and whatnot?
[01:17:37.271 --> 01:17:38.612]  And now I understand.
[01:17:38.993 --> 01:17:41.214]  It's everybody just doing their job, sir.
[01:17:41.535 --> 01:17:43.216]  You know, everybody's just keeping their head down.
[01:17:43.336 --> 01:17:56.321]  Yeah, you know, one, well, recently passed away Army Colonel Al Johnson told me one time, we were talking all day into the night one time, he said, Michael, organizational structure dictates outcome.
[01:17:56.701 --> 01:17:59.363]  Organizational structure dictates outcome, right?
[01:17:59.923 --> 01:18:03.684]  Bottom line, like a clock is a mechanical organizational structure.
[01:18:04.064 --> 01:18:07.186]  All these people at Border Patrol and whatnot, they're gears in the clock.
[01:18:07.386 --> 01:18:12.468]   They don't even know what time it is, but their job is to Click, click, click, put people on the bus.
[01:18:12.689 --> 01:18:18.713]  The bus driver's job is click, click, click, drive them to the wherever, and the next thing you know, they're on the streets of America.
[01:18:19.553 --> 01:18:21.755]  And it's our job to cut the funding off.
[01:18:21.835 --> 01:18:23.596]  It's our government, our Border Patrol.
[01:18:23.936 --> 01:18:24.877]  We're blaming them.
[01:18:25.097 --> 01:18:26.758]  It's our fault for not stopping it.
[01:18:27.058 --> 01:18:28.039]  We have to stop it!
[01:18:28.717 --> 01:18:29.177]  That's right.
[01:18:29.257 --> 01:18:30.458]  That's why we're out here doing it.
[01:18:30.498 --> 01:18:32.940]  That's why we're putting a laser on HIAS.
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:37.243]  HIAS, Catholic Charities, Lutheran Refugee Services, IOM.
[01:18:37.423 --> 01:18:38.383]  We know who they are.
[01:18:38.464 --> 01:18:39.584]  We know where their offices are.
[01:18:39.884 --> 01:18:44.588]  We know, for instance, at the City of Knowledge down in Panama, there's more than 62 NGOs down there.
[01:18:44.868 --> 01:18:54.894]  Norwegian Refugee Council, HIAS, Doctors Without Morals, you know, of course, IOM, UNHCR, World Food Program, Office of Emergency.
[01:18:54.914 --> 01:18:58.597]  And just like with the UN, you can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit a pedophile.
[01:18:59.057 --> 01:18:59.257]  No.
[01:18:59.437 --> 01:19:00.158]  They're just down there.
[01:19:00.278 --> 01:19:01.278]  You should see it down there.
[01:19:01.358 --> 01:19:03.319]  Or not just down there, but in Texas as well.
[01:19:03.459 --> 01:19:05.900]  I mean, it's straight up, it's gross.
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:09.981]  I mean, they have males, you know... Picking up little kids.
[01:19:10.241 --> 01:19:10.701]  Oh yeah.
[01:19:10.721 --> 01:19:13.022]  We got it on tape just a few times when we went down there.
[01:19:13.042 --> 01:19:13.702]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:13.942 --> 01:19:14.783]  And then the guy's still there.
[01:19:14.803 --> 01:19:17.364]  He goes, I'm here to show these children the way of the Lord.
[01:19:17.444 --> 01:19:18.204]  Get out of my way.
[01:19:19.879 --> 01:19:21.862]  And you want to beat their ass, you go to jail.
[01:19:22.242 --> 01:19:23.344]  But then you feel guilty.
[01:19:23.404 --> 01:19:24.265]  I know the board of profiles.
[01:19:24.345 --> 01:19:27.629]  I'm like, I told the press that I feel like I'm part of this now that I didn't.
[01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:29.351]  They're like, yeah, we want to kill this guy.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.821]  I mean, it's sick.
[01:19:31.881 --> 01:19:32.562]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:32.682 --> 01:19:33.462]  I know the feeling.
[01:19:33.622 --> 01:19:34.983]  I feel the same feeling.
[01:19:35.043 --> 01:19:36.584]  Like, we know who they are.
[01:19:36.664 --> 01:19:37.545]  We know where they work.
[01:19:37.745 --> 01:19:39.226]  You know, I mean, we know who they are.
[01:19:39.726 --> 01:19:42.168]  And the bottom line is, it continues to happen.
[01:19:42.448 --> 01:19:46.910]  The undercover cop inside there that was working with us, she comes out, because he chased her out.
[01:19:46.930 --> 01:19:47.911]  She was asking questions.
[01:19:48.311 --> 01:19:50.172]  And he's like, I don't want adults.
[01:19:50.253 --> 01:19:51.253]  I want children.
[01:19:51.713 --> 01:19:52.694]  Load them in my van.
[01:19:52.754 --> 01:19:53.715]  You promised me kids.
[01:19:53.775 --> 01:19:54.975]  He goes, sir, we'll get them to you.
[01:19:54.995 --> 01:19:55.916]  We'll get them to you.
[01:19:55.936 --> 01:19:57.177]  And she starts asking questions.
[01:19:57.757 --> 01:20:03.662]  And then he knows the Spanish, he's a big white guy, and comes out and says, he runs into us.
[01:20:04.363 --> 01:20:08.286]  He's like, I'm gonna show these children the way of the Lord.
[01:20:08.826 --> 01:20:10.948]  What's wrong with me getting, I mean, it was like, whoa.
[01:20:10.968 --> 01:20:11.048]  Yeah.
[01:20:11.068 --> 01:20:12.990]  It was like, whoa.
[01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:15.032]  And later they loaded kids up and he went off and...
[01:20:15.916 --> 01:20:16.816]  Disappeared in a black hole.
[01:20:17.077 --> 01:20:17.577]  I saw that.
[01:20:17.877 --> 01:20:19.037]  I mean, there's no telling what happened.
[01:20:19.057 --> 01:20:19.618]  You can't make this up.
[01:20:19.738 --> 01:20:21.058]  I mean, that's just one of the cases.
[01:20:21.078 --> 01:20:21.238]  Yeah.
[01:20:21.438 --> 01:20:25.700]  Now keep in mind, the Chinese ecosystem is completely different than the rest of them.
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:32.903]  The Chinese clearly are on a path to world domination, and this is actually a group that can achieve a lot of their goals.
[01:20:32.963 --> 01:20:33.644]  They're squaring away.
[01:20:34.184 --> 01:20:34.985]  They are squared away.
[01:20:35.005 --> 01:20:35.545]  They're smart.
[01:20:35.845 --> 01:20:46.172]  You know, again, I've spent a lot of time with Chinese in and around China, Tibet, all over, you know, Beijing, Shanghai, Long, the Xi'an, you know, and the bottom line is they come in with a plan.
[01:20:46.412 --> 01:20:51.016]  They're taking over marijuana grows up in Maine and Oregon and Oklahoma and that sort of thing.
[01:20:51.036 --> 01:20:51.976]  What do they put in that marijuana?
[01:20:52.276 --> 01:20:55.959]  But the bottom line is they're now selling marijuana to our people.
[01:20:56.019 --> 01:20:58.481]  They're making money on our invasion.
[01:20:58.521 --> 01:20:59.882]  They reversed the opium wars.
[01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:04.364]  Oh yeah, now, it's often, you know, when I bring this up to Chinese, they're like, what about the Opium Wars?
[01:21:04.404 --> 01:21:05.845]  And I'm like, look, that was the British.
[01:21:06.205 --> 01:21:07.185]  I'm not British, right?
[01:21:07.425 --> 01:21:10.507]  Yeah, like, but what if my great-great-grandfather did something wrong to you?
[01:21:10.527 --> 01:21:11.788]  What the hell does that mean I'm guilty?
[01:21:11.828 --> 01:21:13.108]  Yeah, and I'm not British anyway.
[01:21:13.148 --> 01:21:14.129]  We shot the British too.
[01:21:14.429 --> 01:21:17.130]  I had two of my grandfathers fight in the Revolutionary War.
[01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:18.631]  One was a colonel in North Carolina.
[01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:19.770]  You know, he might have been...
[01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:20.770]  Great, great, great, great grandfather.
[01:21:20.770 --> 01:21:22.570]  Oh yeah, like super ultra great grandfather.
[01:21:22.570 --> 01:21:27.289]   He may have fought the Green Jackets, who I ended up with in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:21:27.289 --> 01:21:30.890]   And I said to one of the British soldiers one time, "I hope my granddaddy shot your
[01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:32.490]  granddaddy in the chest with a ball."
[01:21:32.490 --> 01:21:33.490]  You know?
[01:21:33.490 --> 01:21:34.570]  But anyway, I love you today.
[01:21:34.570 --> 01:21:37.329]  You know, we're over all that now.
[01:21:37.329 --> 01:21:40.530]  But you know, but the bottom line is, we're not British.
[01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:44.449]   And the British obviously did the opium wars and whatnot, but the Chinese used that as
[01:21:45.324 --> 01:21:53.007]  Now keep in mind, one of the things that the Chinese do as well, is they are, for instance in Honduras, we were just down there looking at their archaeological warfare.
[01:21:53.147 --> 01:21:56.788]  I always go to libraries, museums, archaeological digs.
[01:21:57.028 --> 01:22:05.631]  They're trying to persuade the Mayan Indians that they're actually long-lost cousins of the Chinese, and that they came over the land bridge, and all these bad white people came and took your land.
[01:22:07.372 --> 01:22:08.593]  What's the CIA term?
[01:22:09.233 --> 01:22:14.657]  They're giving them that, oh well they infiltrated the churches, the Liberation Theology.
[01:22:15.237 --> 01:22:15.617]  That's right.
[01:22:15.637 --> 01:22:16.898]  And the Chi-Coms are using that.
[01:22:17.338 --> 01:22:18.399]  Oh yeah, and they're good at it.
[01:22:18.619 --> 01:22:19.680]  They do it in different ways.
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:27.424]  One is they, all the indigenous people throughout, not just here but also in Japan, with the people in Okinawa and the Ainu people and these sorts of things.
[01:22:27.685 --> 01:22:29.326]  It's not just here, I see this all over the world.
[01:22:30.126 --> 01:22:37.330]  You know, trying to persuade all the indigenous people that they can that you're long lost cousins of Chinese and we're coming to help take this stuff back.
[01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:40.652]  Well, I mean, it's true that they got Mongolian spots when they're born and all that.
[01:22:40.692 --> 01:22:42.072]  They are of Asian derivation.
[01:22:42.292 --> 01:22:44.694]  Doesn't mean they're Chinese or the Communist Party.
[01:22:45.134 --> 01:22:45.914]  That's preposterous.
[01:22:46.194 --> 01:22:46.615]  That's right.
[01:22:46.675 --> 01:22:48.336]  Some of the Mayans have those spots as well.
[01:22:48.556 --> 01:22:50.737]  But I don't think most people don't know what you're talking about, though.
[01:22:51.397 --> 01:22:52.478]  Yeah, they are Asian.
[01:22:53.058 --> 01:22:53.758]  They're really Huns.
[01:22:54.399 --> 01:23:00.963]  All right, we're gonna come right back, my friend, and we're gonna have Doc Chambers in the control room to talk about the big victory.
[01:23:01.023 --> 01:23:03.444]  Get that B-roll ready of the 14 governors at the event.
[01:23:04.045 --> 01:23:05.645]  We stopped the left doing a false flag.
[01:23:05.766 --> 01:23:06.346]  Big victory.
[01:23:06.666 --> 01:23:07.166]  Stay with us.
[01:23:07.507 --> 01:23:08.647]  Infowars.com.
[01:23:09.348 --> 01:23:18.853]  Media matters, the Democratic Party, MSNBC, and others have asked me to apologize for making a parody video game criticizing the deep state and all the corruption.
[01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:21.295]  And to all them, I just want to say this.
[01:23:22.196 --> 01:23:23.397]  Go f*** yourselves!
[01:23:25.138 --> 01:23:31.442]  Alex Jones New World Order Wars has been number one on Steam thanks to the viewers and listeners of this broadcast.
[01:23:31.782 --> 01:23:44.990]  And I want to invite everyone, before they are successful at banning, which I hope they aren't, to go to alexjonesgame.com and follow the link to Steam and download this game for $17.76 as a message to the New World Order.
[01:23:45.690 --> 01:23:46.190]  F*** you!
[01:23:46.731 --> 01:23:54.735]  You want to try to ban this game just like you want to steal elections and force injections on us and open up our borders and rape us.
[01:23:55.155 --> 01:23:59.137]  This is a culture war and they're scared of this game.
[01:23:59.557 --> 01:24:08.282]  Get Alex Jones' New World Order Wars right now at AlexJonesGame.com because anything badass gets censored!
[01:24:09.042 --> 01:24:20.326]  Now, I'm not here telling Michael Yan what to do, but he has succeeded in his two-year mission to get Darien Gap in front of Congress on Fox News, Tucker Carlson, the UN funding.
[01:24:20.466 --> 01:24:22.787]  I tried to get Congress to focus on UN funding.
[01:24:23.207 --> 01:24:24.047]  It's the Achilles heel.
[01:24:24.307 --> 01:24:25.128]  This guy did it.
[01:24:25.148 --> 01:24:32.470]  And it's not about, he doesn't want the credit, but it's about the credit of motivated people and what they've done and we can win.
[01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:33.510]  Let's get that straight.
[01:24:33.711 --> 01:24:34.831]  Look how far we've all come.
[01:24:35.882 --> 01:24:40.203]  Now Jack Posobiec, formerly Naval Intelligence, nobody I know is as dialed in as he is.
[01:24:40.323 --> 01:24:41.203]  Let's just leave it at that.
[01:24:41.884 --> 01:24:46.585]  He said over a year ago, they're going to try to make Poland, they're going to put in this new leader they did.
[01:24:46.605 --> 01:24:55.027]  He named him a year ago, and they're going to start arresting the opposition in Poland, and make it like Ukraine, and attack Russia with some type of false flag provocation.
[01:24:55.447 --> 01:24:56.688]  So Doc Chambers is going to be with us.
[01:24:56.708 --> 01:24:58.488]  We're extending this interview to 15 minutes to the next hour.
[01:24:58.508 --> 01:25:00.209]  Dr. Cheryl Emanuel is in the studio.
[01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:01.569]  We'll extend her into the next hour.
[01:25:01.609 --> 01:25:04.510]  I'm doing all four hours today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:04.990 --> 01:25:17.734]  But this, Jack's very busy over at Human Events, reaching tens of millions every day, and obviously dominating on X, but he is joining us with this Build article, biggest publication in the mouth of NATO, saying Poland is getting ready for war.
[01:25:18.075 --> 01:25:20.235]  We have the Defense Minister of England saying it two weeks ago.
[01:25:20.275 --> 01:25:22.796]  We have the Defense Minister of Sweden saying it.
[01:25:23.196 --> 01:25:25.697]  No evidence of that, but how are they going to try to pull it off?
[01:25:25.737 --> 01:25:29.639]  So for tomorrow's news today, popping in for just a few minutes is Jack Posobiec.
[01:25:29.679 --> 01:25:30.599]  Jack, thanks for joining us.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.240]  Alex, thanks so much for having me on.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.041]  Michael, how are you?
[01:25:34.061 --> 01:25:36.681]  Good to see you safe back in the United States.
[01:25:36.701 --> 01:25:38.262]  They're always trying to take you out, man.
[01:25:38.822 --> 01:25:40.602]  I've been wanting to get you down, man.
[01:25:40.762 --> 01:25:42.223]  You're our number one target.
[01:25:42.363 --> 01:25:44.063]  Come with me to Darien, please.
[01:25:44.083 --> 01:25:45.183]  I keep inviting you.
[01:25:45.203 --> 01:25:46.084]  Alright, alright, alright.
[01:25:46.224 --> 01:25:47.524]  It's time for you to come.
[01:25:47.904 --> 01:25:50.745]  Won't break any OPSEC, but we might have to put something together.
[01:25:50.765 --> 01:25:51.825]  Might have to put something together.
[01:25:53.168 --> 01:25:54.189]  All right, give us the report.
[01:25:54.209 --> 01:25:54.929]  This is serious.
[01:25:54.949 --> 01:25:56.190]  All right, Alex.
[01:25:56.210 --> 01:25:57.271]  So here's what's going on.
[01:25:57.311 --> 01:25:57.531]  All right.
[01:25:57.571 --> 01:25:59.112]  And it's very clear to me now.
[01:25:59.532 --> 01:26:12.781]  And this is this has been the pieces of this have been coming to place for a past year now because what's happening in Poland is intrinsically linked to what's happening in Ukraine and what the pursuing now what we're seeing the globalists pursue.
[01:26:13.317 --> 01:26:16.358]  is a Syrianization strategy with Ukraine.
[01:26:16.738 --> 01:26:17.738]  What do I mean by this?
[01:26:17.798 --> 01:26:18.539]  It's very simple.
[01:26:18.579 --> 01:26:26.841]  Remember, Russia was the last, was last involved in a conflict where the United States was a party, not in Ukraine, but prior to that was the what?
[01:26:26.941 --> 01:26:28.441]  The Syrian Civil War.
[01:26:28.941 --> 01:26:31.282]  Go and look at where the Syrian Civil War is now.
[01:26:31.342 --> 01:26:37.004]  And oh, by the way, this is exactly where all of these attacks are taking place on those bases where we've got U.S.
[01:26:37.064 --> 01:26:40.685]  soldiers, where people were killed just across the border in Jordan, Tower 22.
[01:26:41.983 --> 01:26:43.043]  What do we have there?
[01:26:43.063 --> 01:26:43.704]  We've got U.S.
[01:26:43.744 --> 01:26:56.347]  forces on the ground, particularly in the border region, particularly in the Kurdish regions in the northeast, providing basically this human shield against possible incursions from the Iranians, from Shia militia groups, from Turkey to the north.
[01:26:56.687 --> 01:27:01.669]  And then you've, of course, got Russia propping up and really strongly with the Syrian army and Assad.
[01:27:02.209 --> 01:27:05.730]  Now you're going to see a similar situation, all right?
[01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:07.411]  You're going to see a similar situation.
[01:27:07.791 --> 01:27:10.192]  This is where they plan to move things with Ukraine.
[01:27:10.572 --> 01:27:11.552]  Because what are they going to do?
[01:27:12.306 --> 01:27:14.027]  They're gonna say, okay, it's a frozen conflict.
[01:27:14.027 --> 01:27:16.765]   They're gonna draw the line essentially at the river there.
[01:27:16.765 --> 01:27:21.947]   Putin's already talking about putting in a DMZ and people are arguing about where that DMZ is gonna be.
[01:27:21.947 --> 01:27:24.106]  Is it gonna include Odessa, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:27:24.106 --> 01:27:29.266]   But then of course, you need that force to provide the stabilization arm for the other side,
[01:27:29.266 --> 01:27:31.786]  the same way US forces are doing this in Syria.
[01:27:31.786 --> 01:27:33.067]  So who's gonna do that?
[01:27:33.067 --> 01:27:34.626]  That will be Poland.
[01:27:34.626 --> 01:27:36.666]  That will be the Polish troops.
[01:27:36.666 --> 01:27:38.947]  They'll come in in Western Ukraine.
[01:27:38.947 --> 01:27:41.345]  And now what are you gonna see the Ukrainian government do?
[01:27:41.345 --> 01:27:43.746]  You're already seeing them do it, Alex.
[01:27:43.746 --> 01:27:46.786]   And you and I actually, I think we inadvertently mentioned this
[01:27:46.786 --> 01:27:51.626]   in one of our asides, one of the recent times I was on, because who is Zelensky talking about
[01:27:51.626 --> 01:27:53.327]  putting in charge of the military?
[01:27:53.195 --> 01:28:01.621]  He's talking about not just getting rid of the head of the military, he wants to replace the entire heads of every department of the military and put this guy Budenov in there.
[01:28:01.961 --> 01:28:03.742]  Budenov, what's his background?
[01:28:04.022 --> 01:28:07.465]  He's from the intelligence services of Ukraine.
[01:28:07.705 --> 01:28:10.927]  He's the CIA's top partner in Ukraine.
[01:28:10.947 --> 01:28:13.509]  This is the guy who was behind the Kerch Bridge attack.
[01:28:13.749 --> 01:28:18.832]  He's been behind a series of covert clandestine operations against Russia, against the backfield.
[01:28:19.053 --> 01:28:21.134]  Alex, this is exactly what they're planning for.
[01:28:21.514 --> 01:28:28.659]  That $60 billion that you see in that bill that's currently on the table in Congress, it's been stalled right now.
[01:28:28.679 --> 01:28:32.682]  But the reason they want that $60 billion in, that's number one, to prop up the Zelensky regime.
[01:28:32.722 --> 01:28:37.485]  And then number two, they're going to conduct a series, they're going to move this to a counterinsurgency phase.
[01:28:37.845 --> 01:28:38.386]  Using what?
[01:28:38.686 --> 01:28:42.830]  The same style as Operation Gladio style leave behind networks.
[01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:43.891]  That's what they're putting booted up.
[01:28:43.931 --> 01:28:47.374]  That's why you put an intel agent in charge of the entire military.
[01:28:47.694 --> 01:28:50.937]  This guy is straight out of the Operation Gladio school book.
[01:28:51.337 --> 01:28:53.419]  This is the guy who comes out of that system.
[01:28:53.439 --> 01:28:56.942]  The CIA is going to put him there and then they're going to use him for terror attacks.
[01:28:57.264 --> 01:29:02.508]  Clandestine attacks, covert attacks in Russia, in Donetsk, these bakeries, these marketplaces.
[01:29:02.828 --> 01:29:04.869]  That's the next phase this thing is going to go through.
[01:29:04.889 --> 01:29:10.173]  So they're going to freeze the war and say, all right, we've got this settlement, we've got this treaty, whatever they're going to call it.
[01:29:10.453 --> 01:29:12.594]  Poland's going to come in in the West, right?
[01:29:12.634 --> 01:29:17.337]  And they're going to use Poland as the meat shields of the human meat shields there in the West.
[01:29:17.397 --> 01:29:22.021]  Just hoping, by the way, hoping that they'll get killed the same way we lost three soldiers at Tower 22.
[01:29:22.061 --> 01:29:31.447]   And the final ingredient will be Provocateured events claiming Russian missiles, Russian events.
[01:29:31.647 --> 01:29:32.908]  Of course!
[01:29:33.268 --> 01:29:33.768]  All of it.
[01:29:34.029 --> 01:29:34.409]  All of it.
[01:29:34.509 --> 01:29:35.930]  And this was Operation Gladio.
[01:29:36.090 --> 01:29:45.777]  Operation Gladio, originally, they were going to blame these attacks on communists and say communists are attacking Italy, communists are attacking Germany, we need to go war against the Soviet Union.
[01:29:45.897 --> 01:29:47.558]  That was the point of Operation Gladio.
[01:29:47.578 --> 01:29:49.239]  Thank God it wasn't successful.
[01:29:49.299 --> 01:29:53.282]  They're trying Operation Gladio 2.0 right before our eyes in Ukraine.
[01:29:53.903 --> 01:30:02.288]  You were on the show a year ago, but you got really, not frantic, but very intense the last six months, saying they're going to put in this deputy head of the EU over Poland.
[01:30:03.169 --> 01:30:06.591]  The Poles don't want war, but a parliamentary system, for those who don't know, is not too party.
[01:30:06.891 --> 01:30:09.953]  You can have a group of people that don't know of other parties.
[01:30:10.212 --> 01:30:15.332]   put in a guy that got like 27% of the vote, he's now arresting the political opposition desperately.
[01:30:15.332 --> 01:30:21.012]   How do you see them pushing Poland in? Sweden's not been in a war in 200 years.
[01:30:21.012 --> 01:30:24.881]  They're saying war is imminent. The UK is saying it.
[01:30:24.881 --> 01:30:27.172]  Germany build. I mean, yes, Sweden.
[01:30:27.172 --> 01:30:33.251]   Now, Sweden, of course, Sweden is one of the most anti-Russia countries in all of Europe,
[01:30:33.251 --> 01:30:34.853]  I would say besides Poland.
[01:30:35.068 --> 01:30:39.071]  Poland, of course, in recent history has many reasons to be anti-Russia.
[01:30:39.351 --> 01:30:47.498]  Sweden, of course, though, is extremely anti-Russia because remember, before Russia, before Russia controlled sort of the northern tier of Europe, who was it?
[01:30:47.558 --> 01:30:49.019]  It was the Swedish Empire.
[01:30:49.299 --> 01:30:58.506]   And it was those wars against Peter the Great Where the Swedish Empire, they call it the Northern War, where the Swedish Empire really fell and then Russia became the preeminent leader in the North.
[01:30:58.926 --> 01:31:05.930]  Sweden is looking to regain that with, oh by the way, the influence, the power, and the military might of NATO.
[01:31:06.010 --> 01:31:08.852]  And people ask why does something hundreds of years ago matter?
[01:31:09.293 --> 01:31:10.393]  It's like crips and blood.
[01:31:10.473 --> 01:31:12.455]  Somebody's great granddaddy killed their granddaddy.
[01:31:12.775 --> 01:31:18.639]  And so NATO and the sociologists and the anthropologists are manipulating these old fault lines.
[01:31:19.631 --> 01:31:26.736]  Of course, they're going through and saying, oh, that's the Russians, you remember them from... We're talking, by the way, this is hundreds of years ago, the Swedish Empire.
[01:31:27.316 --> 01:31:33.320]  When you're talking Poland, it's okay, you do at least have people within living memory who remember what the Russian communists were doing.
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:36.523]  This was, you know, for 80 years after World War II.
[01:31:36.563 --> 01:31:48.948]   But the issue here, Alex, is they're using these moral fault lines, these historic fault lines, these historic animuses, to gin up support for a wider war and a wider conflict.
[01:31:48.948 --> 01:31:51.387]  So they'll say, "Okay, maybe we need some Swedish troops."
[01:31:51.387 --> 01:31:53.787]  Right, Sweden. What is the point of having Sweden there?
[01:31:53.787 --> 01:31:59.188]   Because if you have Sweden there, then you have Denmark, then you have Finland. What does this do?
[01:31:59.188 --> 01:32:04.387]   This provides the ability to counteract Russia in the Baltic Sea.
[01:32:04.387 --> 01:32:06.387]  And you predicted all of this, so...
[01:32:06.387 --> 01:32:08.387]  This is Klinenberg.
[01:32:08.822 --> 01:32:13.185]  I'm going to stop interrupting, but you already predicted this months ago, six months ago, a year ago.
[01:32:13.565 --> 01:32:14.586]  Tell us what's coming next.
[01:32:14.606 --> 01:32:15.627]  That's what Jack Posobiec does.
[01:32:17.392 --> 01:32:18.573]  What's coming next, I'll tell you.
[01:32:18.673 --> 01:32:24.037]  It's going to be, on one hand, they will claim that is the stabilization of Ukraine.
[01:32:24.057 --> 01:32:26.278]  They're going to say we're going to stabilize the conflict.
[01:32:26.538 --> 01:32:28.199]  Look, Biden knows this thing's a loser.
[01:32:28.259 --> 01:32:32.422]  He doesn't want this thing going on all the way to 2024 while he's got an election coming up.
[01:32:32.462 --> 01:32:34.363]  He's going to claim to want stabilization.
[01:32:34.383 --> 01:32:37.305]  But what we're going to see are more of these provocations.
[01:32:39.366 --> 01:32:40.687]  Yeah, provocations.
[01:32:40.727 --> 01:32:41.008]  Thank you.
[01:32:41.328 --> 01:32:43.410]  Provocations going on in the backfield.
[01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:47.073]  You're going to see attacks potentially on Polish troops, Polish civilians.
[01:32:47.273 --> 01:32:50.376]  You're going to see attacks on Russian civilians, Russian civilian infrastructure.
[01:32:50.396 --> 01:32:55.621]  Remember, they murdered a truck driver in cold blood to take out the Kerch Strait Bridge.
[01:32:55.661 --> 01:32:57.642]  That's exactly who these guys are.
[01:32:57.702 --> 01:32:59.224]  They're willing to take out civilians.
[01:32:59.464 --> 01:33:06.189]   They're willing to kill people who are just truck drivers or service workers to They're willing to cut Europe's gas off!
[01:33:06.389 --> 01:33:07.890]  They'll kill everyone.
[01:33:08.230 --> 01:33:17.734]  They don't care because you've got these people, and Alex, you and I have said it so many times, Victoria Nuland, you have to understand her Trotskyite background to understand.
[01:33:17.994 --> 01:33:22.196]  Yes, she is a communist, but her family was kicked out of Russia, right?
[01:33:22.436 --> 01:33:23.537]  They lived right near Odessa.
[01:33:24.426 --> 01:33:29.010]  They were kicked out because her family side was the Trotskyite side that lost.
[01:33:29.431 --> 01:33:33.475]  This is why they are anti-Russia, because they want to control Russia.
[01:33:33.515 --> 01:33:35.076]  They believe it is their birthright.
[01:33:35.296 --> 01:33:45.466]  And who was over there in the midst of this massive crisis in Kiev, this massive crisis for Zelensky, who lands all of a sudden with her fresh-baked cookies is Vicky Nuland.
[01:33:46.477 --> 01:33:47.038]  Oh my God.
[01:33:47.639 --> 01:33:51.005]  This is all the same wars being fought over again.
[01:33:51.646 --> 01:33:57.076]  Jack, I know you've got your own show coming up here in about 15-20 minutes there on Human Events.
[01:33:57.156 --> 01:33:59.019]  In two minutes, what else do you want to tell us?
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:08.883]  Well, look, you know, the main thing, of course, we're starting to get reports, obviously, about Tucker, the fact that he's over there speaking, potentially speaking with Putin.
[01:34:08.963 --> 01:34:10.683]  We've seen some of these vans going in.
[01:34:10.743 --> 01:34:12.124]  People say that he's had the interview.
[01:34:12.204 --> 01:34:15.685]  There's some rumors floating around about excerpts of the interview.
[01:34:15.805 --> 01:34:31.934]   All I know is, everyone I know who's close to Tucker is saying that he's being very tight-lipped about it, even within his inner circle, whether or not he's had it, he's had the interview at all, and that's probably because he knows That his phone is being spied on by everyone right now.
[01:34:32.495 --> 01:34:36.419]  I can confirm that.
[01:34:36.980 --> 01:34:40.785]  He told me, you can't really talk on the phone, but I'm going to Europe.
[01:34:40.945 --> 01:34:41.806]  Wait till you see this.
[01:34:42.187 --> 01:34:43.048]  And I was like, oh, Europe?
[01:34:43.068 --> 01:34:44.009]  He's like, yeah, Europe.
[01:34:45.436 --> 01:34:47.438]  Yeah, so yeah, the Europe of Europe.
[01:34:47.478 --> 01:34:53.824]  So I think that the interview that comes out with Tucker and Putin is going to be absolutely monumental.
[01:34:53.864 --> 01:34:56.386]  And by the way, people have said, well, why is he interviewing Putin?
[01:34:56.406 --> 01:34:59.489]  I said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, he should interview Zelensky, too.
[01:34:59.809 --> 01:35:00.810]  He's in the neighborhood.
[01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:07.176]  Why not pop on down to Kiev and say, hey, Vladimir Zelensky, I interviewed the other Vlad, let's interview you next.
[01:35:07.316 --> 01:35:12.780]   Let's have balance and have these people put By the way, Jack, is that your source?
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.101]  Because I was actually told that.
[01:35:14.221 --> 01:35:15.461]  Tucker's there for two more weeks.
[01:35:15.862 --> 01:35:16.602]  That's what I was told.
[01:35:16.642 --> 01:35:17.602]  Not by Tucker, but others.
[01:35:18.903 --> 01:35:21.044]  He wants the Zelensky interview, too, and some other big ones.
[01:35:21.344 --> 01:35:24.026]  What do you predict the other interviews are going to be?
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:27.041]  I think Zelensky's going to shut that down.
[01:35:27.141 --> 01:35:28.241]  I just don't think it's going to happen.
[01:35:28.281 --> 01:35:29.241]  I don't think it's in the cards.
[01:35:29.361 --> 01:35:48.168]   I don't think anyone on that side is going to allow Zelensky to sit down with someone who's actually going to ask him hard questions about where the money's going, hard questions about why so many members of his inner circle are being arrested right now for corruption, and oh, by the way, Well, you said that a month ago, and it's just like Hitler was jealous of Erwin Rommel.
[01:35:48.468 --> 01:35:49.268]  He's very jealous of this general.
[01:35:49.087 --> 01:35:52.567]   he's trying to take out of the military right now, by the way, super popular.
[01:35:52.567 --> 01:35:56.728]   So if they're going to look for a scapegoat, I guarantee you, Vicky Newland will throw
[01:35:56.728 --> 01:35:58.728]  him under the bus.
[01:35:58.728 --> 01:36:00.926]  So Tucker might make it down to Ukraine.
[01:36:00.926 --> 01:36:02.926]  Zelensky might not even make it that long.
[01:36:02.926 --> 01:36:08.126]   Well, you said that a month ago, and it's just like Hitler was jealous of Erwin Rommel.
[01:36:08.126 --> 01:36:09.367]  He's very jealous of this general.
[01:36:09.367 --> 01:36:12.567]   I think we'll probably end up seeing that general be the leader.
[01:36:12.567 --> 01:36:19.047]   Yeah, Ukraine is at a precipice and absolutely ripe for a military takeover right now.
[01:36:19.268 --> 01:36:24.052]  You would see the military essentially push Zelensky out and then maybe prop up somebody else.
[01:36:24.412 --> 01:36:30.316]  Take Petro Poroshenko, for example, the guy who was the previous president, and again, who was selected by Vicky Nuland to be president.
[01:36:30.596 --> 01:36:33.318]  He was the one that was propped up, an oligarch in his own right.
[01:36:33.358 --> 01:36:38.602]  They call him the chocolate oligarch, the chocolate man, because he runs this confectionery industry.
[01:36:39.362 --> 01:36:42.205]  And isn't Vicky Nuland really the president?
[01:36:42.685 --> 01:36:44.287]  She's the one calling the shots.
[01:36:44.587 --> 01:36:46.068]  She's always the one calling the shots.
[01:36:46.128 --> 01:36:47.450]  He's not the one who's there.
[01:36:47.650 --> 01:36:59.961]  One of these excerpts from the rumored excerpts from the Putin interview with Tucker is that Tucker asks him about Zelensky and Putin supposedly.
[01:37:00.301 --> 01:37:02.603]  Again, caveat, caveat, I have no idea if this is real.
[01:37:02.944 --> 01:37:11.850]   It's probably not, but the response is something along the lines of, Well, you know, Zelensky, I used to watch him on the Russian comedy shows that he used to do, and he used to make me laugh a lot.
[01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:13.191]  Maybe we can go back to that.
[01:37:13.551 --> 01:37:24.018]  So, of course, Zelensky was very popular in Russia prior to this for these variety shows, and he was a comedian, and, you know, I think the essential thinking is that this guy is a puppet.
[01:37:24.378 --> 01:37:27.060]  He's gonna go back to playing the piano with his penis.
[01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:29.001]  Alright, how do people find Jack Posobiec?
[01:37:29.775 --> 01:37:31.878]  We'll be up at Human Events daily.
[01:37:31.918 --> 01:37:32.739]  It's going to be coming up.
[01:37:32.779 --> 01:37:35.543]  Of course, we're live on X. We're going to be on Rumble.
[01:37:35.563 --> 01:37:36.564]  We're going to be everywhere.
[01:37:36.624 --> 01:37:42.753]  And if you're listening to InfoWars, you can check us out afterwards on the podcast because I know Alex is up at the same time.
[01:37:43.494 --> 01:37:43.794]  All right.
[01:37:43.814 --> 01:37:44.796]  Thank you so much, Jack.
[01:37:44.836 --> 01:37:45.817]  Please join us again soon.
[01:37:45.897 --> 01:37:46.238]  Dead on.
[01:37:46.681 --> 01:37:47.682]  All right, God bless Alex.
[01:37:47.742 --> 01:37:48.502]  Be safe, Michael.
[01:37:48.522 --> 01:37:49.323]  All right.
[01:37:49.703 --> 01:37:50.123]  See you, Jack.
[01:37:50.383 --> 01:37:51.964]  All right, we're extending your interview 15 minutes.
[01:37:52.004 --> 01:37:52.945]  You guys get your time back.
[01:37:52.985 --> 01:37:53.886]  Thanks for listening to Jack.
[01:37:53.906 --> 01:37:55.066]  He's got you guys dead on.
[01:37:55.467 --> 01:37:56.287]  Oh, he's dead on.
[01:37:56.387 --> 01:37:56.768]  Yeah.
[01:37:56.848 --> 01:37:57.768]  I want your comment on that.
[01:37:57.788 --> 01:38:00.750]  I don't want to get retired Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Pete Chambers.
[01:38:01.511 --> 01:38:02.551]  Brief take geopolitically.
[01:38:02.571 --> 01:38:03.212]  We're going to shift gears.
[01:38:03.252 --> 01:38:07.635]  The big victory with the trucker convoy, 14 governors, the provocateurs.
[01:38:07.655 --> 01:38:08.455]  You guys stopped.
[01:38:08.515 --> 01:38:11.137]  And then just your overall view of what's happening in America right now.
[01:38:11.357 --> 01:38:12.718]  But you want to make some comments on the subject.
[01:38:12.738 --> 01:38:14.439]  You said you were stationed over in Europe.
[01:38:14.739 --> 01:38:18.701]  Oh yeah, you know, I lived in Poland for two years after I was in Special Forces.
[01:38:18.741 --> 01:38:25.585]  When I was in Special Forces, my two different A-teams trained to parachute into Poland near a town called Białystok.
[01:38:25.605 --> 01:38:27.026]  We trained for three years to do that.
[01:38:27.946 --> 01:38:28.947]  A great deal of training.
[01:38:29.547 --> 01:38:33.209]  And what you said earlier, Alex, is like, this is a never-ending war.
[01:38:33.589 --> 01:38:36.371]  It's like a flower that keeps blooming, except it's a dark flower.
[01:38:36.711 --> 01:38:38.292]  I mean, it's Jurassic Trailer Park.
[01:38:38.312 --> 01:38:38.992]  It's like herpes.
[01:38:39.271 --> 01:38:41.152]  It's just to say, it just goes on and on.
[01:38:41.152 --> 01:38:42.431]  I love the Polish people.
[01:38:42.431 --> 01:38:45.832]  Like I said, I lived there for two years after the army.
[01:38:45.832 --> 01:38:49.992]   But at the same time, it will end up just being a forever war.
[01:38:49.992 --> 01:38:55.152]   You can just see it unfolding, whether it's the Baltics, Lithuania, of course,
[01:38:55.152 --> 01:38:57.150]  then Latvia and Estonia.
[01:38:57.150 --> 01:38:59.431]  Everybody's always on the chopping block up there.
[01:38:59.431 --> 01:39:01.751]  As you know, Poland is right there.
[01:39:01.751 --> 01:39:06.150]  It's perfect invasion terrain between Russia and Europe.
[01:39:06.150 --> 01:39:11.631]   And of course, not to go into the details of this, but this is a war that's gone on forever.
[01:39:11.631 --> 01:39:13.631]  Russia needs those warm water ports.
[01:39:13.631 --> 01:39:15.951]  Europe needs the energy.
[01:39:15.919 --> 01:39:25.351]  You know, I was at BASF, what, a year and a half ago or so, and I was warning, or I was actually asking, when would, you know, what's going to happen to the Nord Stream Pipeline?
[01:39:25.371 --> 01:39:26.652]  I actually had an iPad.
[01:39:26.712 --> 01:39:27.093]  No, I know.
[01:39:27.133 --> 01:39:27.934]  You ought to find that clip.
[01:39:27.954 --> 01:39:28.655]  Here's what you're saying.
[01:39:28.895 --> 01:39:30.638]  The war's never end, they're just put on pause.
[01:39:31.517 --> 01:39:32.098]  Absolutely!
[01:39:32.438 --> 01:39:36.162]  And then, for instance, Nord Stream, that it would be cut was really obvious.
[01:39:36.503 --> 01:39:43.811]  I bought an iPad that I kept beside me just watching Nord Stream flows because there was a website that monitored the flows.
[01:39:44.231 --> 01:39:46.294]  And one day it went to zero and I was like, uh-oh.
[01:39:46.454 --> 01:39:49.297]  By the way, that's who we have on as guests, people that are right over and over again.
[01:39:49.317 --> 01:39:50.138]  You never toot your horn.
[01:39:50.418 --> 01:39:52.621]  You should repost on X all the things you predicted.
[01:39:53.797 --> 01:39:54.638]  You're probably right.
[01:39:54.978 --> 01:39:56.619]  No, because then that brings everybody back to what you're doing.
[01:39:56.699 --> 01:39:58.040]  It's not about what you're doing.
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.221]  Let's bring in Lt.
[01:39:59.261 --> 01:39:59.541]  Col.
[01:39:59.581 --> 01:40:06.467]  Dr. Pete Chambers, Green Beret commander, great patriot, expert on the border, been down there on a lot of clandestine stuff.
[01:40:07.047 --> 01:40:11.050]  He led the great convoys, or part of the Texas convoy down there, helped run security.
[01:40:11.070 --> 01:40:12.031]  Turned out it was a big victory.
[01:40:12.051 --> 01:40:14.052]  14 governors showed up.
[01:40:14.192 --> 01:40:17.495]  I cannot say enough about how you guys navigated this.
[01:40:18.055 --> 01:40:21.278]  Give us your 35,000 foot view of what we've generally been talking about, sir.
[01:40:21.899 --> 01:40:26.212]  You're here in studio with us in the control room and then let's drill into what happened at the border in the last week.
[01:40:27.210 --> 01:40:27.810]  Right, Alex.
[01:40:27.930 --> 01:40:28.931]  Yeah, it's good to be here again.
[01:40:28.971 --> 01:40:52.701]  So what we had was a provocateur attack, fifth-generation warfare style, with provocateur media, not only infiltrating them, but infiltrators into the convoys, and then what I call like a World War I Ypres salient, which was an attack where a bulge in the lines of the superior force enemy is surrounded on all three sides by an inferior force in numbers.
[01:40:53.081 --> 01:40:58.104]   So you had Texas law enforcement Supported by the Governor of Texas.
[01:40:58.425 --> 01:41:03.709]  You had we the people down there doing their thing, safely, peacefully assembling to take our border back, people.
[01:41:04.170 --> 01:41:07.292]  And then you had, where are the men from Texas, Tucker Carlson?
[01:41:07.593 --> 01:41:08.794]  We were out there in the darkness.
[01:41:08.834 --> 01:41:11.736]  And we were out there protecting this thing from those provocateurs.
[01:41:12.076 --> 01:41:21.605]  And that is a three-sided pronged attack which combines all those elements of we the people and the local government to thwart off this fifth generation provocateur attack.
[01:41:22.565 --> 01:41:37.317]  Tell us about some of the stuff that happened because I saw some of these provocateurs saying Alex Jones is down here, they just beat up elite migrants and it's all... I've got the clip, I don't want to give the guy attention here, but I mean they were just freaking out and just putting out total disinformation.
[01:41:37.597 --> 01:41:46.800]  Well, before the convoy got there, real quick, the hailstorm hit while the provocateur protesters against Christians were down there, and they had to vacate the scene.
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:47.621]  That's perfect!
[01:41:47.861 --> 01:42:13.814]   Then the convoy came in safely, set up, had a wonderful time, but in the unseen places where we'll celebrate this with cigar and scotch about two weeks from now, things happen to prevent that, which are us giving names to the local law enforcement and to state law enforcement, the DPS, Department of Public Safety, That they could then use that information to make sure that those people were warned, do not try to mess with these people.
[01:42:13.914 --> 01:42:15.135]  Because they had different agendas.
[01:42:16.291 --> 01:42:27.376]  Well, I mean, I know, tell us as much as you can about it, but then also the great success, 14 governors, massive attention, right at the time of trying to put this bill through that gives Biden dictatorial power.
[01:42:27.577 --> 01:42:42.504]  Well, those 14 governors were operating under the 4th, Article 4, Section 4 of the Constitution, which is, you know, as we read on the set there when Governor Abbott wrote that letter on the 24th of January, that's when the first time I saw him actually make that argument.
[01:42:42.904 --> 01:42:44.445]  Because prior to that it was case law.
[01:42:44.485 --> 01:42:46.065]  So now we're arguing the Constitution.
[01:42:46.525 --> 01:42:49.126]  That supports everything that the convoy wanted to do.
[01:42:49.166 --> 01:42:54.768]  That was their number two line of effort was to bring to light how the Constitution was being trampled on.
[01:42:54.828 --> 01:42:56.108]  So that was a victory.
[01:42:56.148 --> 01:42:59.229]  So all these victories, these little victories, add up to a big victory.
[01:42:59.610 --> 01:43:01.370]  Just like that battle I talked about.
[01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:01.970]  Three-sided.
[01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:07.032]  Hey, you bulged in with all this massive money and Soros money and bad guy money.
[01:43:07.212 --> 01:43:07.792]  Well, guess what?
[01:43:08.032 --> 01:43:09.953]  We the people beat you with a lot less resources.
[01:43:10.413 --> 01:43:11.734]  By the way, it's a busy day here.
[01:43:11.774 --> 01:43:17.116]  Tucker just sent me this link two minutes ago, why I'm interviewing Vladimir Putin.
[01:43:17.176 --> 01:43:19.578]  So we'll all take a break at the break.
[01:43:20.058 --> 01:43:21.398]  It's a five minute little segment.
[01:43:21.418 --> 01:43:21.899]  We're going to air this.
[01:43:21.919 --> 01:43:26.841]  Tucker Carlson, Tucker just sent this to me because I asked him, I said, did you get the Putin interview?
[01:43:26.861 --> 01:43:27.721]  And he just sent me this.
[01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:32.430]  One minute ago.
[01:43:33.090 --> 01:43:34.491]  So I just sent this to the crew.
[01:43:34.551 --> 01:43:36.231]  Tucker just sent me a message from Russia.
[01:43:36.891 --> 01:43:38.992]  And so we'll have that for you.
[01:43:39.492 --> 01:43:43.013]  But the bottom line is, you guys never asked to be celebrated.
[01:43:43.033 --> 01:43:44.653]  You're quiet professionals.
[01:43:44.713 --> 01:43:47.754]  But now you're in the information warfare public zone.
[01:43:48.274 --> 01:43:51.715]  Listeners need to celebrate men and women that are fighting tyranny.
[01:43:52.736 --> 01:43:55.900]  Because it's contagious, and we go through a lot, and we also need support.
[01:43:56.340 --> 01:43:58.583]  And I just want to point out that we're having major victories.
[01:43:58.904 --> 01:44:00.666]  We're in a target-rich environment right now.
[01:44:01.087 --> 01:44:02.168]  The globalists aren't in beta.
[01:44:02.208 --> 01:44:03.149]  They're in operational.
[01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:04.111]  They're overrunning us.
[01:44:04.131 --> 01:44:07.075]  But I'll quote that Marine Corps general from Korea.
[01:44:07.295 --> 01:44:10.079]  They said, I forget his name, and they said, sir, we're completely surrounded.
[01:44:10.379 --> 01:44:11.340]  And there she won the battle.
[01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:12.701]  I know the whole story, I forget his name.
[01:44:12.962 --> 01:44:14.923]  And he said, good, we can attack in all directions.
[01:44:15.204 --> 01:44:17.346]  That wasn't bravado, that's true.
[01:44:17.706 --> 01:44:25.754]  Because when you finally got the enemy out, you got all this ammo, the truth, and all these artillery and weapons aimed at them, you can blast the living hell out of them if it's a million Chinese.
[01:44:26.354 --> 01:44:26.554]  Yeah.
[01:44:26.914 --> 01:44:33.097]  As Michael, Jan, and I both know, you know, Green Berets go out downrange behind enemy lines with 12 men in their force multipliers.
[01:44:33.437 --> 01:44:37.578]  So when I had most of my team, which were retired Green Berets, we understand what to do.
[01:44:37.939 --> 01:44:39.839]  We didn't, I didn't even carry a weapon that day.
[01:44:39.859 --> 01:44:40.620]  I don't need to.
[01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:52.144]  Because all of this right here, and this, this weapon, the mind, this verbal judo, this, uh, you know, these are not... Because you already had the relationships, the background, the respect, and you had law enforcement who had the guns.
[01:44:52.204 --> 01:44:53.765]  You were the commander working with them.
[01:44:54.145 --> 01:44:54.465]  Yes, sir.
[01:44:54.485 --> 01:45:00.448]  So I was a liaison to the law enforcement, to the truckers, and honestly, it was just amazing to watch.
[01:45:00.528 --> 01:45:07.590]  And then, you know, of course, I took a deep breath as everybody vacated the scene and drove away, and nothing happened from the Mike side or from Mexico.
[01:45:07.951 --> 01:45:08.951]  You've got to be pleased.
[01:45:08.971 --> 01:45:18.475]  And the reason I tell these stories, folks, is explaining people are looking for leadership and that the left, I didn't even know these groups were, Anonymous attacked us last week and a bunch of stuff when I defended you.
[01:45:19.235 --> 01:45:20.215]  And it went super viral.
[01:45:20.255 --> 01:45:24.537]  I just made a little comment where they were calling you a wimp and all these little antifa people.
[01:45:25.157 --> 01:45:28.998]  And then I learned there's this whole ecosystem attacking you and General Flynn, everybody.
[01:45:29.278 --> 01:45:39.162]  They're so scared, particularly of the Green Berets, trained to defend people, trained to defend the common people, trained to force multiply populations, and they're panicking.
[01:45:39.402 --> 01:45:42.743]  Why are all these Green Berets, young and old, why are they everywhere?
[01:45:42.823 --> 01:45:43.903]  Who's running them?
[01:45:43.923 --> 01:45:44.763]  Who's giving them orders?
[01:45:44.843 --> 01:45:46.484]  Well, you're not getting orders.
[01:45:46.724 --> 01:45:49.546]  But from the Constitution and God, you see the attack.
[01:45:49.806 --> 01:45:51.568]  You know the Republic's under attack.
[01:45:51.808 --> 01:45:53.189]  This is the main battlefield.
[01:45:53.429 --> 01:45:55.210]  We haven't had to do this since 1776.
[01:45:55.911 --> 01:45:57.212]  This is the ultimate battle.
[01:45:57.432 --> 01:46:00.795]  And of course our military is now joining us to win.
[01:46:01.175 --> 01:46:02.096]  This is our country.
[01:46:02.896 --> 01:46:03.317]  Amen.
[01:46:03.397 --> 01:46:05.919]  Yeah, look, I'm just proud to be on the team.
[01:46:05.939 --> 01:46:09.701]  You know, I happen to be the guy that's the face of this, but there are so many out there you'll never know.
[01:46:10.782 --> 01:46:13.504]  And that's, I'm telling you, the left is shitting their britches right now.
[01:46:13.764 --> 01:46:14.145]  They should.
[01:46:15.209 --> 01:46:24.551]  Tell us a few more minutes about how great this was with the governors and hundreds, billions of dollars of news time that you guys got with this huge success.
[01:46:24.791 --> 01:46:33.793]  Right, so with Kristi Noem, she's from South Dakota, she came down and actually supported us originally on Operation Lone Star with some of her troops and then they continued that relationship.
[01:46:34.174 --> 01:46:40.255]  The governor of Texas, Governor Stitt, I'm sorry, of Oklahoma, Governor Stitt, he was the first one to stand up and say, yeah, I'm with y'all.
[01:46:40.715 --> 01:46:42.176]  So that was just across the Red River.
[01:46:42.456 --> 01:46:46.357]  Then you had South Carolina, and then you had everything all the way up to New Hampshire, hard to believe.
[01:46:46.737 --> 01:46:48.678]  But, you know, they're a freedom state.
[01:46:49.018 --> 01:46:50.359]  All the way across to Montana.
[01:46:50.599 --> 01:46:56.401]  And then people at the rally from Alaska all the way across the continental United States.
[01:46:56.802 --> 01:46:58.882]  So, for me, that was good to see.
[01:46:59.223 --> 01:47:00.263]  All these governors that came in.
[01:47:00.343 --> 01:47:06.466]   Florida, they provided Airboats on that river since the beginning of Operation Lone Star.
[01:47:06.486 --> 01:47:07.706]  We appreciate the Floridians.
[01:47:08.366 --> 01:47:14.629]  There are Floridians that are still down here now, just sitting at that camp, continuing to make sure he's safe.
[01:47:14.669 --> 01:47:26.134]  And all the people that pooh-poohed this, we didn't pooh-pooh it, we just said be careful, but some did, especially on the left, they look like fools now because this brought massive attention and it brought unity and an example for the states to link up again in the future.
[01:47:26.354 --> 01:47:30.937]  Those people that pooh-poohed it, look, they're good people that make mistakes on analysis.
[01:47:31.317 --> 01:47:34.439]  But understand this, and this is the book that I look at, my field manual is the Bible.
[01:47:34.759 --> 01:47:39.122]  In Revelation 28.8, it says, number one, what God detests, that's the cowardly.
[01:47:40.253 --> 01:47:41.113]  God hates cowards!
[01:47:41.473 --> 01:47:41.833]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:42.554 --> 01:47:43.674]  Well, we gotta take action.
[01:47:43.734 --> 01:47:47.855]  Just as we've been set up and defeated before, doesn't mean we give up.
[01:47:48.295 --> 01:47:49.956]  I'd say we have 90% victory.
[01:47:50.316 --> 01:47:52.016]  So, we can't just sit here on our asses.
[01:47:52.496 --> 01:47:54.837]  It's just one skirmish, if you will.
[01:47:55.657 --> 01:47:58.718]  We're gonna continue to sink in, and we're gonna keep them on their spurs.
[01:47:59.338 --> 01:48:04.886]  All right, the Tucker Carlson exclusive, I mean exclusive, he sent it to me, it's out on X. I asked him, I said, what's going on?
[01:48:04.906 --> 01:48:06.428]  I asked him an hour ago, here's the video.
[01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:13.357]  So Tucker's response, and we'll come back to one more segment, you great Americans, and then we will bring in another great American.
[01:48:14.619 --> 01:48:15.379]  To be in studio with us.
[01:48:15.399 --> 01:48:15.760]  Stay with us.
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:17.641]  Hey, I got some good news for everybody.

[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:17.980]  We're in Moscow tonight.
[01:49:17.886 --> 01:49:20.847]  We're here to interview the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
[01:49:20.927 --> 01:49:22.027]  We'll be doing that soon.
[01:49:22.787 --> 01:49:28.869]  There are risks to conducting an interview like this, obviously, so we've thought about it carefully over many months.
[01:49:29.349 --> 01:49:30.210]  Here's why we're doing it.
[01:49:31.090 --> 01:49:32.451]  First, because it's our job.
[01:49:32.751 --> 01:49:33.591]  We're in journalism.
[01:49:34.131 --> 01:49:36.032]  Our duty is to inform people.
[01:49:36.983 --> 01:49:42.365]  Two years into a war that's reshaping the entire world, most Americans are not informed.
[01:49:42.705 --> 01:49:48.648]  They have no real idea what's happening in this region, here in Russia or 600 miles away in Ukraine.
[01:49:49.408 --> 01:49:50.168]  But they should know.
[01:49:50.649 --> 01:49:54.530]  They're paying for much of it, in ways they might not fully yet perceive.
[01:49:55.591 --> 01:49:57.732]  The war in Ukraine is a human disaster.
[01:49:58.132 --> 01:50:05.995]  It's left hundreds of thousands of people dead, an entire generation of young Ukrainians, and has depopulated the largest country in Europe.
[01:50:07.230 --> 01:50:09.590]  But the long-term effects are even more profound.
[01:50:10.563 --> 01:50:14.966]  This war has utterly reshaped the global military and trade alliances.
[01:50:15.827 --> 01:50:17.769]  And the sanctions that followed have as well.
[01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:20.871]  And in total, they have upended the world economy.
[01:50:21.772 --> 01:50:31.539]  The post-World War II economic order, the system that guaranteed prosperity in the West for more than 80 years, is coming apart very fast, and along with it, the dominance of the U.S.
[01:50:31.599 --> 01:50:31.959]  dollar.
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:34.341]  These are not small changes.
[01:50:34.401 --> 01:50:36.623]  They are history-altering developments.
[01:50:37.183 --> 01:50:39.065]  They will define the lives of our grandchildren.
[01:50:40.034 --> 01:50:41.796]  Most of the world understands this perfectly well.
[01:50:41.816 --> 01:50:42.496]  They can see it.
[01:50:42.957 --> 01:50:46.260]  Ask anyone in Asia or the Middle East what the future looks like.
[01:50:47.401 --> 01:50:51.124]  And yet the populations of the English-speaking countries seem mostly unaware.
[01:50:51.745 --> 01:50:53.627]  They think that as nothing has really changed.
[01:50:53.947 --> 01:50:57.190]  And they think that because no one has told them the truth.
[01:50:57.991 --> 01:50:59.773]  Their media outlets are corrupt.
[01:51:00.053 --> 01:51:01.955]  They lie to their readers and viewers.
[01:51:02.475 --> 01:51:04.177]  And they do that mostly by omission.
[01:51:05.421 --> 01:51:16.186]  For example, since the day the war in Ukraine began, American media outlets have spoken to scores of people from Ukraine, and they've done scores of interviews with Ukrainian President Zelensky.
[01:51:16.966 --> 01:51:19.427]  We ourselves have put in a request for an interview with Zelensky.
[01:51:19.467 --> 01:51:20.328]  We hope he accepts.
[01:51:21.108 --> 01:51:24.429]  But the interviews he's already done in the United States are not traditional interviews.
[01:51:25.110 --> 01:51:30.612]  They are fawning pep sessions specifically designed to amplify Zelensky's demand that the U.S.
[01:51:30.692 --> 01:51:34.114]  enter more deeply into a war in Eastern Europe and pay for it.
[01:51:35.319 --> 01:51:36.320]  That is not journalism.
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:38.101]  It is government propaganda.
[01:51:38.822 --> 01:51:41.724]  Propaganda of the ugliest kind, the kind that kills people.
[01:51:42.765 --> 01:51:56.255]  At the same time our politicians and media outlets have been doing this, promoting a foreign leader like he's a new consumer brand, not a single Western journalist has bothered to interview the president of the other country involved in this conflict, Vladimir Putin.
[01:51:57.376 --> 01:52:01.579]  Most Americans have no idea why Putin invaded Ukraine, or what his goals are now.
[01:52:01.699 --> 01:52:02.620]  They've never heard his voice.
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:03.981]  That's wrong.
[01:52:05.208 --> 01:52:08.991]  Americans have a right to know all they can about a war they're implicated in.
[01:52:09.371 --> 01:52:12.673]  And we have the right to tell them about it because we are Americans too.
[01:52:13.334 --> 01:52:15.255]  Freedom of speech is our birthright.
[01:52:15.455 --> 01:52:17.697]  We were born with the right to say what we believe.
[01:52:18.397 --> 01:52:21.720]  That right cannot be taken away no matter who is in the White House.
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:23.641]  But they're trying anyway.
[01:52:24.382 --> 01:52:31.407]  Almost three years ago, the Biden administration illegally spied on our text messages and then leaked the contents to their servants in the news media.
[01:52:31.947 --> 01:52:34.469]  They did this in order to stop a Putin interview that we were planning.
[01:52:35.532 --> 01:52:38.815]  Last month, we're pretty certain they did exactly the same thing once again.
[01:52:39.415 --> 01:52:41.717]  But this time, we came to Moscow anyway.
[01:52:42.979 --> 01:52:45.261]  We are not here because we love Vladimir Putin.
[01:52:45.841 --> 01:52:50.925]  We are here because we love the United States, and we want it to remain prosperous and free.
[01:52:52.026 --> 01:52:53.328]  We paid for this trip ourselves.
[01:52:53.368 --> 01:52:55.209]  We took no money from any government or group.
[01:52:55.930 --> 01:52:57.771]  Nor are we charging people to see the interview.
[01:52:57.791 --> 01:52:59.012]  It is not behind a paywall.
[01:52:59.890 --> 01:53:06.292]  Anyone can watch the entire thing, shot live to tape and unedited, on our website, TuckerCarlson.com.
[01:53:07.152 --> 01:53:14.674]  Elon Musk, to his great credit, has promised not to suppress or block this interview once we post it on his platform, Axe, and we're grateful for that.
[01:53:15.934 --> 01:53:23.856]  Western governments, by contrast, will certainly do their best to censor this video on other, less principled platforms, because that's what they do.
[01:53:24.137 --> 01:53:26.417]  They are afraid of information they can't control.
[01:53:27.277 --> 01:53:29.198]  But you have no reason to be afraid of it.
[01:53:29.963 --> 01:53:33.684]  We are not encouraging you to agree with what Putin may say in this interview.
[01:53:34.224 --> 01:53:35.905]  But we are urging you to watch it.
[01:53:36.365 --> 01:53:38.285]  You should know as much as you can.
[01:53:38.645 --> 01:53:43.146]  And then, like a free citizen and not a slave, you can decide for yourself.
[01:53:43.806 --> 01:54:04.726]  Thanks.
[01:54:04.701 --> 01:54:06.202]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:54:09.604 --> 01:54:11.586]  Alright, we've got two heavy hitters here with us.
[01:54:12.577 --> 01:54:19.000]  Colonel and Medical Doctor Pete Chambers, Green Beret Commander and the great Michael Young, the top wartime correspondent in the world.
[01:54:19.660 --> 01:54:22.601]  We got 10 minutes left before Dr. Selah Emanuel comes in studio.
[01:54:22.621 --> 01:54:26.203]  So I'm going to have you guys have the floor and host this and make points.
[01:54:26.243 --> 01:54:28.624]  So you go ahead and interview Doc here.
[01:54:29.064 --> 01:54:29.364]  Go ahead.
[01:54:30.816 --> 01:54:31.056]  All right.
[01:54:31.096 --> 01:54:31.497]  Hey, Doc.
[01:54:31.597 --> 01:54:36.763]  Well, looks like we've got control here for 10 minutes, so we better make the best of it.
[01:54:36.943 --> 01:54:39.646]  Well, we came a long way from Fort Bragg, didn't we?
[01:54:39.866 --> 01:54:40.867]  Yeah, we did.
[01:54:41.328 --> 01:54:44.512]  I mean, just what Alex just said, we're here to force multiply.
[01:54:44.852 --> 01:54:47.715]  I mean, we are Americans and we're here to take our country.
[01:54:48.216 --> 01:54:55.642]   And, you know, interesting, Alex got here sitting on the desk, this This, uh, you know, he goes over a lot of news reports every day.
[01:54:55.682 --> 01:54:56.082]  Here's one.
[01:54:56.122 --> 01:55:01.845]  The World Economic Forum orders governments to demonetize citizens who believe in conspiracy theories.
[01:55:02.145 --> 01:55:06.868]  That's quite interesting because, you know, Coinbase, by the way, has seized my account.
[01:55:06.928 --> 01:55:07.488]  Coinbase.
[01:55:07.808 --> 01:55:10.829]  A lot of people say, well, why were you in Coinbase to begin with?
[01:55:11.170 --> 01:55:17.474]   Well, I was in Coinbase because some people Wanted to donate through Coinbase, so I ended up with a Coinbase account.
[01:55:17.854 --> 01:55:24.239]  And now, Coinbase, who is closely aligned with World Economic Forum, has seized my account, seemingly randomly.
[01:55:24.639 --> 01:55:26.561]  But Doc, yeah, so here we are.
[01:55:26.881 --> 01:55:29.223]  We have a lot of other people coming on that are helping us.
[01:55:29.283 --> 01:55:33.346]  We see the energy, as Alex has already said, is changing in our favor.
[01:55:33.706 --> 01:55:41.316]  We have a lot of Americans now who are joining and realizing that the threat that we face with this, we have no borders.
[01:55:41.616 --> 01:55:42.818]  The borders are gone, right?
[01:55:43.359 --> 01:55:50.628]  And anybody who facilitates these open borders is our enemy.
[01:55:50.728 --> 01:55:51.830]  For instance, Mayorkas.
[01:55:52.150 --> 01:55:59.595]  You know, he threw the Holocaust card when he was during his impeachment hearings and whatnot.
[01:55:59.755 --> 01:56:05.818]  I've been supplying information that can help with his impeachment, and as have you and others, and it's on.
[01:56:06.319 --> 01:56:08.000]  Doc, what do you have to say about all this?
[01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:16.685]  Right, so you know, while we have the floor here, let's take it up a notch from the 40,000 foot view and let's look at the spiritual moral injury of a nation.
[01:56:17.205 --> 01:56:21.950]  And the thing that's nearest to us is our soldiers, our veterans.
[01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:42.436]   And that right there, with us now pairing up and teaming up with, not just us, but across the nation, The Declaration of Military Accountability that happened on January the 1st of this year at 0400 hours, that was signed by 231 participants and then a bunch of people that signed on the petition.
[01:56:42.896 --> 01:56:48.637]  That reflects of where the institution, our institution that we hold dear, is at.
[01:56:48.737 --> 01:56:51.058]  It's a moral injury that's taking place at the top.
[01:56:51.878 --> 01:57:01.421]   As you and I both know, that have been led or led men in combat or in garrison, Uh, where the atmosphere of the leadership trickles down.
[01:57:01.861 --> 01:57:09.005]  And we've got to really take a look at this because that accountability, that declaration of military accountability, that's just one institution.
[01:57:09.025 --> 01:57:15.528]  We've got so many more as you talk about energy and food and all these institutions that have been damaged and demoralized.
[01:57:16.028 --> 01:57:25.155]  That is the second and third order effects of what Besmanoff talked about back in the 80s, 90s, when he said, we will take down America from inside.
[01:57:25.615 --> 01:57:26.556]  We're seeing that now.
[01:57:26.676 --> 01:57:27.777]  This is that time.
[01:57:28.376 --> 01:57:30.498]  Here they go talking about Alejandro Mayorkas.
[01:57:30.779 --> 01:57:31.980]  His name's not Alejandro.
[01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:33.582]  His name is Alex, right?
[01:57:33.902 --> 01:57:40.088]  He transitioned to Alejandro after... By the way, I want to say it again.
[01:57:40.769 --> 01:57:49.799]  Alex Mayorkas was a board member on HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, before he took over Department of Homeland Security, right?
[01:57:50.279 --> 01:58:05.572]  So we've got like Catholic charities and the Lutheran refugee groups and all these others who are using various religious cloaks, let's say, and they're bringing in billions of dollars, quite literally, year after year.
[01:58:05.632 --> 01:58:10.837]  We've got, of course, IOM is the main funder of, they're the main engine of the invasion is IOM.
[01:58:12.398 --> 01:58:14.379]  The International Organization for Migration.
[01:58:14.659 --> 01:58:15.899]  While you're going through U.S.
[01:58:15.999 --> 01:58:19.460]  airports, you'll often see people with IOM bags.
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:23.341]  It'll be a white bag with blue writing or a blue bag with white writing.
[01:58:23.601 --> 01:58:27.082]  Sometimes it's O-I-M, sometimes it's I-O-M, depending on the language.
[01:58:27.382 --> 01:58:31.043]  But if you see people carrying those bags, they're probably aliens.
[01:58:31.063 --> 01:58:32.603]  So you should ask them.
[01:58:33.003 --> 01:58:34.784]  Often they'll show you their papers, right?
[01:58:34.904 --> 01:58:36.664]  If you ask them, hey, where are you going to?
[01:58:37.004 --> 01:58:39.125]  Now, the Chinese generally will not speak with you.
[01:58:39.505 --> 01:58:42.987]  But the others, for instance, Venezuelans, they almost always want to tell their story.
[01:58:43.347 --> 01:58:44.567]  Syrians, not so much.
[01:58:44.627 --> 01:58:45.768]  They can be quite aggressive.
[01:58:46.408 --> 01:58:47.989]  Some of the groups can be very aggressive.
[01:58:48.609 --> 01:58:54.612]  But the Chinese are of specific interest, but most of the Chinese you won't see carrying those bags in the airports.
[01:58:55.012 --> 01:58:59.474]   Most of the Chinese slip through More clandestine ways.
[01:58:59.895 --> 01:59:05.158]  Even if they're coming across the border, they throw their passports away on the other side of the border in Mexico.
[01:59:05.238 --> 01:59:07.799]  Actually, there's burn barrels on the other side of the border.
[01:59:08.139 --> 01:59:16.604]  I've been to the other side, on the Mexican side, and you'll see burn barrels where they actually throw their documents into these barrels and burn them before they come into the U.S.
[01:59:16.924 --> 01:59:18.205]  so they can't be compromised.
[01:59:18.285 --> 01:59:20.927]  Right, and Michael, I'd like to add to that because on the tactical...
[01:59:21.727 --> 01:59:57.469]   Level of this this thing on the ground when I was in uniform on the Texas border in Del Rio We had about 17,000 Haitians show up in about a 48 hour period but there were Chinese so keep this in mind This is a technique you throw 17,000 people in and then the Chinese come in the periphery they come in the left and the right Upstream downstream and right there in Del Rio, and I think I've taken you there There's a business that was flying a Chinese flag in Del Rio, Texas 400 meter from a crossing point So we know that that connection is there and that business has subsequently kept the flag down after a couple of locals cut it down.
[01:59:58.266 --> 01:59:58.486]  Right.
[01:59:58.526 --> 02:00:00.288]  Yeah, you and I went to that flag.
[02:00:00.308 --> 02:00:01.089]  You took me to it.
[02:00:01.169 --> 02:00:01.469]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:01.509 --> 02:00:09.937]  You know, in downtown San Salvador, in El Salvador, I was just over there, they actually have a huge Chinese Communist Party flag in El Salvador.
[02:00:10.297 --> 02:00:15.241]  I mean, it's flying at this new library that the Chinese Communist Party just built in El Salvador.
[02:00:15.562 --> 02:00:20.786]  Well, yeah, the deepest seawater port in the Mediterranean is Piraeus, Greece, and the port of Athens.
[02:00:21.187 --> 02:00:31.124]   And that That docking area is two-thirds owned, leased for the next hundred years by China, the deepest seawater port on the Mediterranean.
[02:00:31.605 --> 02:00:35.306]  A great deal of what's going on is about routes and energy, right?
[02:00:35.446 --> 02:00:36.826]  A lot of this is what's going on.
[02:00:36.866 --> 02:00:45.789]  For instance, that's why I focus so much on Panama and Netherlands and other places like this, because there's numerous layers of the war that's going on.
[02:00:46.309 --> 02:00:48.893]  A lot of people will just focus on Israel versus Hamas.
[02:00:49.193 --> 02:00:51.917]  That's like, that's a parking lot fight compared to what's going on.
[02:00:52.218 --> 02:01:00.670]  We're talking about straight up World War III is unfolding and it's- I mean the lockdown of three years in the third world, the UN admits starved 84 million people to death.
[02:01:00.990 --> 02:01:02.172]  That's not a blip on the radar screen.
[02:01:03.137 --> 02:01:04.318]  To the public, because they're not told.
[02:01:04.378 --> 02:01:06.120]  It's all about Hamas and Israel.
[02:01:06.140 --> 02:01:07.181]  That's all they want to talk about.
[02:01:07.221 --> 02:01:07.782]  No, no.
[02:01:07.802 --> 02:01:09.263]  There is so much stuff, much bigger.
[02:01:09.283 --> 02:01:10.625]  We're not pooh-poohing what's happening there.
[02:01:10.665 --> 02:01:11.225]  That's terrible.
[02:01:11.546 --> 02:01:12.707]  But it's massive.
[02:01:12.747 --> 02:01:16.411]  The New World Order and BlackRock are taking over all the infrastructure.
[02:01:16.791 --> 02:01:21.036]  And we need military men that are trained, that have been through this to defend the Republic.
[02:01:21.076 --> 02:01:21.977]  And you guys are doing it.
[02:01:22.017 --> 02:01:27.422]   I'm so excited to see so many other great veterans, professionals, Really coming out of the woodwork here.
[02:01:27.942 --> 02:01:33.326]  And you can see, like you've said, you say it all the time on your show, the energy is moving to our side now.
[02:01:33.466 --> 02:01:34.106]  I can feel it.
[02:01:34.366 --> 02:01:35.567]  You know, when you're fighting.
[02:01:35.647 --> 02:01:36.588]  I've been on there 30 years.
[02:01:36.628 --> 02:01:39.209]  People used to say I was negative when we were getting our ass kicked.
[02:01:39.229 --> 02:01:40.490]  Now they're like, oh, you're being too positive.
[02:01:40.530 --> 02:01:41.851]  No, I am white pill, baby.
[02:01:42.331 --> 02:01:42.932]  I can feel it.
[02:01:43.012 --> 02:01:44.252]  I feel the energy coming over.
[02:01:44.272 --> 02:01:49.096]  You know, when you're and when you're doing something big, you're fighting or whatever, you can feel the energy change in the system.
[02:01:49.436 --> 02:01:50.677]  We can feel the energy now.
[02:01:50.797 --> 02:01:51.257]  Oh, yeah.
[02:01:51.477 --> 02:01:52.838]  There's the energy is building.
[02:01:53.118 --> 02:01:53.878]  More and more people.
[02:01:53.938 --> 02:01:55.379]  We know the names of the enemies.
[02:01:55.659 --> 02:01:59.080]  But that means the enemy's gonna really pull the stops out.
[02:01:59.100 --> 02:02:04.402]  Can you guys, in closing, speak to... You know, Colonel, lead us in... We only got a minute left here.
[02:02:05.022 --> 02:02:06.963]  Lead us in a minute-long prayer right now.
[02:02:06.983 --> 02:02:09.004]  I don't think... I know everything's God.
[02:02:09.324 --> 02:02:10.864]  If we don't have God on our side, we're done.
[02:02:10.984 --> 02:02:13.165]  We do have God, but we need to put it all on God.
[02:02:13.225 --> 02:02:14.526]  We can't do this, only God can.
[02:02:14.566 --> 02:02:15.606]  Colonel, lead us in a one-minute prayer.
[02:02:15.565 --> 02:02:17.565]  I'll lead us in a one-minute prayer.
[02:02:17.565 --> 02:02:22.045]   Gracious Heavenly Father, we come before you today only servants and broken men, but Lord,
[02:02:22.045 --> 02:02:23.885]  we ask that you fill us with your Holy Spirit.
[02:02:23.885 --> 02:02:29.725]   Lord, we ask that you empty us of anything that is not humble.
[02:02:29.969 --> 02:02:34.251]  Lord, you give us the strength, you give us wisdom, and you teach us how to be left to bang.
[02:02:34.531 --> 02:02:39.034]  You've traded our hands for war with your powerful sword of the Spirit.
[02:02:39.354 --> 02:02:43.256]  And Lord, we ask you that we be penetrating in our truth.
[02:02:43.757 --> 02:02:45.057]  And Lord, we give these things to you.
[02:02:45.097 --> 02:02:45.978]  In Christ's name we pray.
[02:02:46.178 --> 02:02:46.478]  Amen.
[02:02:46.798 --> 02:02:47.439]  Alright, beautiful.
[02:02:47.779 --> 02:02:48.819]  How do they find you, Colonel?
[02:02:48.859 --> 02:02:49.660]  How do they find you, Jan?
[02:02:50.635 --> 02:02:55.300]  I hope they don't find me, but I think probably DrPeteChambers.com.
[02:02:55.781 --> 02:02:56.101]  Alright.
[02:02:56.482 --> 02:03:00.206]  And I'm on X, just Michael underscore Jan, Yankee Oscar November.
[02:03:01.187 --> 02:03:01.688]  By the way...
[02:03:03.315 --> 02:03:06.639]  I've got so much evil happening right now to us, but so much good.
[02:03:06.739 --> 02:03:10.442]  Such good stuff's happening right now behind the scenes.
[02:03:10.983 --> 02:03:15.027]  I've got these other guests coming in, but I really should just leave with the stuff that I've just learned behind the scenes.
[02:03:15.447 --> 02:03:17.810]  I've got a lot of people calling me right now, but I'm going to do the best I can.
[02:03:18.130 --> 02:03:19.732]  Gentlemen, thank you so much for all you're doing.
[02:03:20.232 --> 02:03:20.713]  Thank you, sir.
[02:03:20.793 --> 02:03:21.213]  Love you guys.
[02:03:21.233 --> 02:03:21.814]  I really appreciate it.
[02:03:22.735 --> 02:03:24.476]  All right, Dr. Stella Emanuel is coming in here.
[02:03:25.498 --> 02:03:30.981]  And I may just have her and, uh, Whiskey host, cause I got some big stuff behind the scenes I gotta deal with right now.
[02:03:31.422 --> 02:03:32.462]  But this is important too.
[02:03:32.943 --> 02:03:34.323]  Stay with us at FullWars.com.
[02:03:37.986 --> 02:03:40.727]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[02:03:40.987 --> 02:03:41.368]  We think.
[02:03:41.408 --> 02:03:41.948]  Just let me think.
[02:03:41.988 --> 02:03:47.531]  In fact, even now, orders are being shouts into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[02:03:47.571 --> 02:03:48.312]  It's Chancellor Suttler.
[02:03:48.892 --> 02:03:49.453]  Damn it!
[02:03:49.573 --> 02:03:49.773]  Why?
[02:03:50.635 --> 02:03:56.660]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[02:03:57.220 --> 02:04:00.403]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[02:04:03.180 --> 02:04:08.004]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[02:04:08.024 --> 02:04:08.984]  You decided, sir.
[02:04:09.044 --> 02:04:09.965]  You wanted it foolproof.
[02:04:09.985 --> 02:04:11.386]  You taught me every television in London!
[02:04:11.646 --> 02:04:13.728]  Cruelty and injustice.
[02:04:13.748 --> 02:04:15.068]  Intolerance and oppression.
[02:04:15.549 --> 02:04:25.175]  And where once you had the freedom to object and to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[02:04:25.195 --> 02:04:25.355]  Cameras.
[02:04:25.375 --> 02:04:26.076]  We need cameras.
[02:04:26.396 --> 02:04:27.137]  How did this happen?
[02:04:27.837 --> 02:04:28.598]  Who's to blame?
[02:04:29.618 --> 02:04:32.222]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[02:04:32.242 --> 02:04:34.145]  They will be held accountable.
[02:04:34.165 --> 02:04:40.033]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[02:04:41.238 --> 02:04:43.040]  I know why you did it.
[02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:44.301]  I know you were afraid.
[02:04:44.321 --> 02:04:46.482]  Who would you be?
[02:04:46.502 --> 02:04:46.562]  War?
[02:04:46.723 --> 02:04:47.283]  Terror?
[02:04:47.363 --> 02:04:48.004]  Disease?
[02:04:48.644 --> 02:04:54.489]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[02:04:55.089 --> 02:04:56.531]  Fear got the best of you.
[02:04:56.911 --> 02:05:00.874]  And in your panic, you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[02:05:01.495 --> 02:05:02.555]  He promised you order.
[02:05:02.596 --> 02:05:03.616]  He promised you peace.
[02:05:03.896 --> 02:05:07.896]   And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[02:05:07.896 --> 02:05:15.896]  There is a war.
[02:05:16.055 --> 02:05:17.037]  It's happening now.
[02:05:17.938 --> 02:05:19.742]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:05:20.303 --> 02:05:22.106]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:05:22.887 --> 02:05:24.329]  We are the Resistance.
[02:05:24.590 --> 02:05:26.590]  We are the Infowar.
[02:05:26.590 --> 02:05:42.590]  [Music]
[02:05:42.590 --> 02:05:46.590]  Alright, Dr. Stella Emanuel is our guest in studio.
[02:05:46.416 --> 02:05:50.006]  She had technical issues when she was home a few weeks ago, so I asked her to come up here.
[02:05:51.221 --> 02:06:03.628]  Houston and she's whether she's great medical doctor one of the first to come out against the shot come out against the lie And come out with the therapeutics that she's been vindicated, but I wanted to get her on here to talk about disease X They're saying it's imminent.
[02:06:03.668 --> 02:06:21.978]   It's coming with all this gain of function And then we see record deaths happening the life expectancy dropping From the shots from all of it the people don't know how to protect themselves This is all about action and how to protect yourself ladies and gentlemen so dr. Stella manual great to have you here in studio and It's always a pleasure, Alex.
[02:06:22.698 --> 02:06:28.101]  I think the American people need to wake up, not just the American people, but the world, because we are in a battle, in a war.
[02:06:28.701 --> 02:06:31.862]  And like I said, you deal with info wars, and we're going up the borders.
[02:06:31.902 --> 02:06:32.683]  And that's not words.
[02:06:32.763 --> 02:06:33.583]  We're in a war.
[02:06:33.603 --> 02:06:34.363]  We're in a war.
[02:06:34.523 --> 02:06:35.224]  This is real.
[02:06:35.284 --> 02:06:38.945]  We're in a serious war, and they are trying to destroy humanity.
[02:06:39.005 --> 02:06:46.669]  And humanity needs to wake up with that mindset of we are in a war, and live your life with preparation that you are in a war.
[02:06:47.089 --> 02:06:48.549]  You know, you heard about Disease X.
[02:06:49.870 --> 02:06:51.610]  This started in 2018.
[02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:54.931]  They just wanted to put a placemaker for a pandemic that will come.
[02:06:55.631 --> 02:06:58.992]  WHA is talking about that there will be a pandemic and it's going to come.
[02:06:59.072 --> 02:07:00.512]  Oh, Trump's going to get challenged.
[02:07:00.552 --> 02:07:02.073]  Yes.
[02:07:02.293 --> 02:07:03.273]  They are not stopping.
[02:07:03.413 --> 02:07:06.834]  This is an election year and they're going to try to bring some kind of pandemic.
[02:07:07.374 --> 02:07:10.335]  There was an article that was written.
[02:07:12.509 --> 02:07:19.233]  There was an article in December, they talked about how... By the way, you know I've got a family emergency right now, so just go ahead and ask, is that okay?
[02:07:19.453 --> 02:07:19.653]  Yes.
[02:07:19.793 --> 02:07:20.194]  Alright, go ahead.
[02:07:20.354 --> 02:07:21.274]  I'm not disrespecting, go ahead.
[02:07:21.454 --> 02:07:32.081]  Yes, they said there was going to be an article that is going to... they wrote an article about declaration of federal registrar declaration for public readiness for Ebola and Marburg, and that's kind of crazy.
[02:07:32.441 --> 02:07:34.762]  Why would they get up and start talking about Ebola and Marburg?
[02:07:34.802 --> 02:07:36.063]  This was November 27, 2023.
[02:07:38.044 --> 02:07:51.013]  And then of course, December 19, there was an article in Market Watch about a Texas Biomed Lab that is already at a phase 2 clinical trials for vaccine against Marburg and Ebola.
[02:07:51.453 --> 02:07:52.554]  And this was in San Antonio.
[02:07:52.974 --> 02:07:55.896]  And of course, where did they do this training?
[02:07:55.916 --> 02:08:02.861]  They did volunteers from Kenya and from Uganda so that they can try and use them to talk about Marburg and Ebola.
[02:08:03.041 --> 02:08:05.983]  Why is the country talking about Marburg and Ebola?
[02:08:06.443 --> 02:08:13.790]   I would say this about I don't want people to be scared about what we're talking about because Marburg and Ebola have not succeeded to be a true pandemic.
[02:08:14.471 --> 02:08:14.871]  Reason?
[02:08:15.131 --> 02:08:19.115]  If Marburg and Ebola could be a pandemic by now, it would have hit many nations.
[02:08:19.596 --> 02:08:25.282]  Many times how Marburg and Ebola has come up, it has not become a pandemic because of the way the disease runs.
[02:08:25.922 --> 02:08:29.226]  A virus that kills its host is not a good pandemic.
[02:08:31.488 --> 02:08:35.813]  But the issue with Marburg and Ebola is that when they come out, people get sick.
[02:08:36.154 --> 02:08:40.599]  People get like this diarrhea and bloody flux and you know the people are sick.
[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:51.586]   With COVID, flu and all this other stuff, when you get sick, When you start transmitting the disease, it goes in the air and stuff like that and people you can just cough and get people infected.
[02:08:52.087 --> 02:08:58.854]  But with Marburg, it's not something that is transmitted by droplets or you don't cough on people and they catch Marburg.
[02:08:58.874 --> 02:09:00.776]  So people should not be scared about Marburg like that.
[02:09:01.437 --> 02:09:03.999]  What you need to do is just be careful.
[02:09:04.460 --> 02:09:08.244]  And before people can transmit Marburg and Ebola, they are already sick.
[02:09:08.684 --> 02:09:15.548]  So if the government is already planning, they said the Federal Registry had a readiness for Ebola and Marburg November 27, 2023.
[02:09:15.608 --> 02:09:17.870]  That means they are planning something.
[02:09:17.910 --> 02:09:18.810]  This is an election year.
[02:09:19.170 --> 02:09:21.392]  So you do not be surprised.
[02:09:21.432 --> 02:09:24.313]  I will not be surprised if they get up and said, OK, Marburg and Ebola is around.
[02:09:24.734 --> 02:09:25.634]  But here's the issue.
[02:09:26.214 --> 02:09:33.539]  Both Marburg and Ebola, they are single-stranded RNA viruses like every other single-stranded RNA virus.
[02:09:33.719 --> 02:09:34.960]  They are sensitive to zinc.
[02:09:35.965 --> 02:09:41.366]  And they are sensitive to not just zinc but to something like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.
[02:09:41.786 --> 02:09:50.188]  That is why my cry, my scream to everybody in America listening to my voice is that make sure you have hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in your medicine cabinet.
[02:09:50.468 --> 02:09:58.530]  Whether you go across to Mexico and get it or you go on our website and do a telemedicine appointment and get it or you go to your wherever but just make sure that you are prepared.
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:02.261]  Why do I say single-stranded RNA viruses?
[02:10:02.281 --> 02:10:03.361]  They are sensitive to zinc.
[02:10:04.002 --> 02:10:06.042]  But zinc cannot enter into the cell.
[02:10:06.142 --> 02:10:12.084]  So what happens is zinc needs something to open the channel so that zinc can go into the cell.
[02:10:12.504 --> 02:10:16.326]  So that is why you're going to need something like hydroxychloroquine or quercetin.
[02:10:16.366 --> 02:10:18.867]  Quercetin is over-the-counter and you can actually buy it.
[02:10:19.427 --> 02:10:24.608]  Quercetin you can buy just as a supplement that opens zinc channels and allows zinc to go into the cell.
[02:10:25.009 --> 02:10:33.088]   So that combination that we have with hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin or quercetin and with vitamins
[02:10:33.088 --> 02:10:38.649]   like vitamin D and zinc can help with Marburg, it can help with Ebola, it can help with all kinds
[02:10:38.649 --> 02:10:41.408]  of viruses, especially if they're single-stranded viruses.
[02:10:41.408 --> 02:10:47.328]   So that's why I tell people, when you guys hear these things, just be prepared, don't be scared
[02:10:47.328 --> 02:10:50.929]   and don't wait till something really, really bad happens and you get scared.
[02:10:51.090 --> 02:11:03.473]  Like I said, with Marburg and Ebola, I would not be too terrified because, except, of course, they do some kind of genetic modification on the thing to make it more infective, most times they cannot become true pandemics.
[02:11:03.793 --> 02:11:04.953]  But they are floating it.
[02:11:05.613 --> 02:11:09.594]  The government is also talking about disease X. The WHO, everybody are talking about disease X.
[02:11:11.681 --> 02:11:13.442]  Disease X is not a particular disease.
[02:11:13.822 --> 02:11:15.543]  Disease X is whatever they plan to do.
[02:11:16.263 --> 02:11:23.427]  In fact, they said COVID was the first disease X. It's a placeholder for some pandemic that will happen.
[02:11:23.547 --> 02:11:31.590]  And Tedros, the head of WHO said about 20% of people are going to be, you know, they're going to die from this new pandemic.
[02:11:32.011 --> 02:11:35.972]  So I don't know what they are talking about, but disease X is not a real disease.
[02:11:36.413 --> 02:11:38.854]  It's a placeholder for whatever it is that they are going to release.
[02:11:39.434 --> 02:11:44.899]  But let me keep everybody, like I said, I'm not here to scare you, I'm here to get you with a preparation mindset.
[02:11:46.158 --> 02:11:54.684]  I want to tell everybody, regardless of what diseases these demons bring up, remember that they don't want their families to die, and they themselves don't want to die.
[02:11:54.964 --> 02:12:01.949]  So they will always have a solution hidden somewhere, and it is our job to find this solution and tell people before it really happens.
[02:12:02.370 --> 02:12:07.754]  So when you start hearing about Disease X, don't get scared, don't get frightened, don't get all combobulated.
[02:12:08.134 --> 02:12:10.415]  Just be prepared medically and make sure... That's right.
[02:12:10.435 --> 02:12:11.756]  Dr. Stella Emanuel, stay there.
[02:12:12.938 --> 02:12:13.560]  We're live!
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:15.406]  It's Tuesday, February 6th, 2024.
[02:12:15.827 --> 02:12:16.589]  I'm Alex Jones.

[02:12:28.413 --> 02:12:38.155]  Although the depopulation systems of the Great Reset are not yet fully operational, the Great Reset does have a strong conspiracy network.
[02:12:38.615 --> 02:12:44.477]  It is protected by a satanic shield, which can be disabled by the Great Awakening.
[02:12:44.897 --> 02:12:51.098]  The Great Reset must be deactivated if any victory for humanity is to be accomplished.
[02:12:52.145 --> 02:13:06.198]  Once the Great Awakening deactivates the shield, InfoWars.com forward slash show will cover the truth while Info Warriors fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the Great Reset.
[02:13:06.698 --> 02:13:10.421]  Alex Jones has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.

[02:13:22.670 --> 02:13:23.690]  Dr. Stella Emanuel.
[02:13:24.070 --> 02:13:30.573]  She's an original OG, going back four years ago, saying this is a lie, this is a fraud, and offending people.
[02:13:31.073 --> 02:13:32.494]  She's also a sponsor of the show.

[02:13:40.877 --> 02:13:46.522]  And so we're talking about God gave us things to prepare and to be ready and to know what's going on.
[02:13:46.702 --> 02:13:48.844]  I take your supplements, my dad, my family take it.
[02:13:49.424 --> 02:13:56.850]  Let's talk some about the amazing supplements people will find right now on your website drstellamd.com.

[02:14:12.363 --> 02:14:15.626]  And I can't tell you, you know, I bought it from you before I were working with you.
[02:14:15.687 --> 02:14:17.889]  I knew you for years, but I've stockpiled it.
[02:14:17.909 --> 02:14:18.729]  I just hand it out.
[02:14:19.330 --> 02:14:21.192]  This is so important to be ready.
[02:14:21.692 --> 02:14:25.496]  Record level deaths going on from the shots and from all the things going on.
[02:14:25.976 --> 02:14:27.658]  And they just keep it on the back burner now.
[02:14:28.078 --> 02:14:29.540]  People don't know what to do.
[02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:32.883]  So Dr. Stella, talk about the products and what you think people should do to protect themselves.
[02:14:33.484 --> 02:14:38.907]  I think every, like I always say that everybody needs to have hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in their medicine cabinet.
[02:14:39.227 --> 02:14:42.129]  It's not something that you should wait till you get sick.
[02:14:42.409 --> 02:14:43.950]  And you explain in Africa, everybody has it.
[02:14:44.130 --> 02:14:44.390]  Yes.
[02:14:44.570 --> 02:14:46.511]  Africa had the lowest death rate from COVID.
[02:14:46.531 --> 02:14:47.252]  From COVID, yes.
[02:14:47.312 --> 02:14:49.113]  Because they have it in the medicine cabinet.
[02:14:49.213 --> 02:14:50.273]  They have it over the counter.
[02:14:50.673 --> 02:14:52.534]  But here, you cannot get it over the counter.
[02:14:52.555 --> 02:15:00.339]  So the best thing is to, you go on our website, you make a telemedicine appointment, and then you get hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in your medicine cabinet.
[02:15:00.879 --> 02:15:12.585]  Before, you know, there was an article that came out in the NIH that on January 7th, Zika, that hydroxychloroquine actually works to treat Zika virus.
[02:15:12.665 --> 02:15:19.589]  By the way, my doctor, I'm not going to say his name, he owns clinics all over Texas, he's like, you know, triple medical doctor and a scientist.
[02:15:21.267 --> 02:15:29.830]  I've been going to him for like six, seven years, and they have been pushing the last two years just to routinely take Avermectin, all the things you've been saying.
[02:15:30.491 --> 02:15:31.431]  The science is clear now.
[02:15:31.531 --> 02:15:31.731]  Yes.
[02:15:32.151 --> 02:15:37.674]  So what I advise, what I do, I've been taking weekly hydroxychloroquine for four years.
[02:15:37.734 --> 02:15:38.734]  I've really not gotten sick.
[02:15:38.754 --> 02:15:40.275]  You know, when my family... That's a low dose.
[02:15:40.295 --> 02:15:41.235]  My dad used to get sick all the time.
[02:15:41.255 --> 02:15:41.695]  Never got sick now.
[02:15:41.715 --> 02:15:42.115]  Low dose, yes.
[02:15:42.335 --> 02:15:43.256]  Just a very low dose.
[02:15:44.216 --> 02:15:46.197]  It doesn't affect your heart when you take that low dose.
[02:15:46.218 --> 02:15:46.838]  You understand what I'm saying?
[02:15:47.078 --> 02:15:50.220]  People that have lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, they are taking it for years.
[02:15:50.601 --> 02:15:53.603]  Some people take weekly hydroxy, some people take weekly ivermectin.
[02:15:53.863 --> 02:15:56.565]  I have hundreds of thousands of... And my dad takes two little pills a week.
[02:15:56.685 --> 02:15:56.905]  Yes.
[02:15:57.345 --> 02:16:03.209]  You know, Medscape did an article on me that I was the highest prescriber of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in the country?
[02:16:03.690 --> 02:16:12.016]   Hey, yeah, because I am Telling people be safe, do not sit down and wait for what is Ebola or Zika or whatever.
[02:16:12.316 --> 02:16:16.619]  Because, like I said, these things are single-stranded RNA viruses.
[02:16:16.679 --> 02:16:18.361]  What does Ivermectin do that blocks it?
[02:16:19.021 --> 02:16:21.063]  Ivermectin works in many, many ways.
[02:16:21.543 --> 02:16:25.646]  One of the things that Ivermectin does is it functions as an ionophore.
[02:16:25.967 --> 02:16:28.108]  It opens channels and allows zinc in.
[02:16:28.469 --> 02:16:30.770]  It destroys, it stops replication of viruses.
[02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:32.432]  So zinc kills viruses, it opens the channel?
[02:16:32.492 --> 02:16:32.672]  Yes.
[02:16:33.032 --> 02:16:34.113]  So it opens the door?
[02:16:34.353 --> 02:16:34.953]  It opens the door.
[02:16:35.233 --> 02:16:39.195]  Hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, Quercetin, they all open the door for zinc to go into the cell.
[02:16:39.516 --> 02:16:44.298]  But Ivermectin also works later because it stops replication of the virus.
[02:16:44.938 --> 02:16:49.001]  It actually stops the virus from clinging to your cells and staying there.
[02:16:49.281 --> 02:16:51.182]  So it works in many, many ways.
[02:16:51.222 --> 02:16:55.204]  This little molecule called Ivermectin does a whole lot of things.
[02:16:55.344 --> 02:16:58.846]  And we've known for years how great these medicines are.
[02:16:59.426 --> 02:17:04.347]  In fact, there are articles, there are articles even on NIH about ivermectin and cancer.
[02:17:04.707 --> 02:17:10.249]  I mean, I don't treat cancer, I'm not an oncologist, but if you go on NIH and put ivermectin on cancer, you will see articles about it.
[02:17:10.269 --> 02:17:13.310]  Well, that's what hurt them three or four years ago, is they would say it doesn't work.
[02:17:13.590 --> 02:17:15.170]  You could go there, there was hundreds of studies.
[02:17:15.290 --> 02:17:17.851]  Yes, there are hundreds of studies on the NIH website.
[02:17:18.191 --> 02:17:19.911]  There are hundreds of studies.
[02:17:20.331 --> 02:17:21.732]  They're just hoping you don't look it up.
[02:17:21.912 --> 02:17:22.072]  Yes.
[02:17:22.472 --> 02:17:27.255]  You know, when they started talking about Ebola, of course I'd like to go on NIH website and dig up.
[02:17:27.696 --> 02:17:35.501]  I found an article about proteases and peptides that help to break the outer shell of the Ebola virus.
[02:17:35.981 --> 02:17:38.403]  And that's why we put together what I call Vira Immune Plus.
[02:17:38.883 --> 02:17:48.369]   This thing has all these peptides and proteases that will help They will help like break the cell of the virus and build your immunity against all of these viruses.
[02:17:48.389 --> 02:17:49.310]  And what's the name again?
[02:17:49.330 --> 02:17:51.111]  You know, remember you like this one, the Viral Immune Plus.
[02:17:51.131 --> 02:17:51.712]  No, it tastes good.
[02:17:51.892 --> 02:17:52.612]  Yes, it tastes good.
[02:17:52.932 --> 02:18:00.798]  So, and then Covilite has vitamin C, vitamin D, has quercetin, has Narc, has all this stuff in it.
[02:18:01.078 --> 02:18:08.924]  So that way when you take them, it kind of builds your immunity and stops you from being able to like, you know, get into, you know, get sick.
[02:18:09.024 --> 02:18:09.504]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:18:09.524 --> 02:18:11.926]  By the way, the ingredients in your products are amazing.
[02:18:12.506 --> 02:18:15.329]  Yes, so that's why I tell people, don't wait till you get sick.
[02:18:15.869 --> 02:18:17.650]  Start taking supplements now.
[02:18:18.411 --> 02:18:23.315]  Don't just, it's not just about hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, it's to make sure your vitamin D levels are up.
[02:18:23.856 --> 02:18:27.579]  Most, if you notice Alex, that people get a lot of viruses during the winter.
[02:18:27.899 --> 02:18:32.203]  Because during the winter there's no sun, people hide in their homes and their vitamin D levels are down.
[02:18:32.583 --> 02:18:38.148]  So when we have, if you have our product Covivite, it has vitamin C, D, zinc and quercetin.
[02:18:38.488 --> 02:18:40.770]  So you can have everything that you need to stay healthy.
[02:18:40.870 --> 02:18:42.351]  And this stuff works.
[02:18:42.391 --> 02:18:46.114]  This is not something that people should wait and say, no, no, no, we're going to wait till next week.
[02:18:46.194 --> 02:18:47.315]  My dad was almost dead.
[02:18:47.375 --> 02:18:47.916]  It saved him.
[02:18:48.456 --> 02:18:50.757]  Yes, so people should stop and say no.
[02:18:50.777 --> 02:18:58.902]  I've had people, I had a lady, a young lady, pregnant, 30 weeks and sick, and they were just looking at her and waiting for her to die.
[02:18:59.422 --> 02:19:09.868]  And then I brought her in, gave her a breathing treatment with Budesonide, put her on hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, which we give to pregnant women, we give to newborn babies, we give to old people.
[02:19:10.348 --> 02:19:11.789]  These are safe drugs.
[02:19:12.589 --> 02:19:15.230]  America, don't wait till you get sick.
[02:19:15.390 --> 02:19:18.911]  Don't wait till they throw some crazy virus and you're running helter-skelter.
[02:19:19.371 --> 02:19:20.191]  Be prepared now.
[02:19:20.271 --> 02:19:21.892]  And by the way... Be prepared now.
[02:19:21.932 --> 02:19:24.312]  You are totally vindicated with all the other doctors and scientists.
[02:19:25.012 --> 02:19:26.333]  All these treatments were real.
[02:19:26.373 --> 02:19:27.333]  They tried to suppress it.
[02:19:27.393 --> 02:19:27.913]  It's come out.
[02:19:27.953 --> 02:19:28.453]  They're evil.
[02:19:29.194 --> 02:19:29.614]  They're evil.
[02:19:29.754 --> 02:19:30.494]  These people are evil.
[02:19:31.074 --> 02:19:31.754]  That's the bottom line.
[02:19:31.794 --> 02:19:36.876]  They are very evil and their whole thing is they want... Look at what the wars is to kill people.
[02:19:37.756 --> 02:19:40.057]  They are trying to stop food production, right?
[02:19:40.077 --> 02:19:44.299]  You know about the farmers in Europe that are rioting right now because they want to bring famine.
[02:19:44.679 --> 02:19:46.299]  Right now the war in Ukraine and Russia.
[02:19:46.359 --> 02:19:50.561]  Russia and Ukraine were the greatest producer of wheat and also and grains.
[02:19:50.661 --> 02:19:51.421]  You understand what I'm saying?
[02:19:51.441 --> 02:19:54.422]  So the war actually just pushes famine all over the world.
[02:19:54.822 --> 02:20:01.025]   If you read in the book of Revelation chapter 6, The third seal is famine.
[02:20:01.425 --> 02:20:02.866]  The second seal is a sword.
[02:20:03.126 --> 02:20:05.308]  But what is the first seal in Revelation 6, Alex?
[02:20:05.948 --> 02:20:10.771]  They said it was a crown and a jab, which is actually a crown.
[02:20:10.831 --> 02:20:11.651]  A crown is corona.
[02:20:12.172 --> 02:20:17.575]  The Bible talks about it that, you know, the first horse went out and he was given a crown, which is corona.
[02:20:17.754 --> 02:20:23.754]   and was given a bull which is actually interpreted like a poisonous dart which is the shot.
[02:20:23.754 --> 02:20:27.754]   So these things have been written, predicted in the Bible and they are working just...
[02:20:27.754 --> 02:20:29.754]  And it predicts the green horse of pestilence.
[02:20:29.754 --> 02:20:37.754]   Yes. So and then the famine, pestilence, the fourth horse is famine, pestilence, death and all that stuff.
[02:20:37.831 --> 02:20:38.711]  And we are seeing it.
[02:20:39.111 --> 02:20:41.352]  We're seeing young people die of cancers.
[02:20:41.653 --> 02:20:44.194]  We are seeing young people get... They admit it's all exploding.
[02:20:44.274 --> 02:20:45.975]  It's all just coming through.
[02:20:46.475 --> 02:20:51.017]  This is what I tell people if you've been vaccinated and you took the vaccine and you made a mistake.
[02:20:51.878 --> 02:20:52.498]  Just repent.
[02:20:52.538 --> 02:20:54.359]  If you go on our website, there's a whole thing we do there.
[02:20:54.399 --> 02:20:55.360]  Repent and pray.
[02:20:55.840 --> 02:20:57.161]  This stuff is luciferous.
[02:20:58.041 --> 02:21:03.446]  Alex, inside the COVID vaccine, the biomarker is Luciferous.
[02:21:03.646 --> 02:21:05.288]  Go look in the Modena website.
[02:21:05.328 --> 02:21:06.549]  That's the patent.
[02:21:06.889 --> 02:21:09.472]  Yes, but I tell you what, Luciferous is Lucifer.
[02:21:09.812 --> 02:21:13.695]  And anything that is a devil, a dimension of the name of Jesus, it can be uprooted.
[02:21:14.076 --> 02:21:16.278]  So we've prayed for people... Oh, you're not just saying this.
[02:21:16.378 --> 02:21:17.158]  All the studies show that...
[02:21:17.859 --> 02:21:20.140]  People that pray beat cancer more.
[02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:28.385]  Yes, we've prayed for people that took the vaccine and we prayed for them and they got healed from heart disease.
[02:21:29.305 --> 02:21:33.447]  We had a program in front of one of these hospitals in Houston.
[02:21:35.268 --> 02:21:42.750]  And there was a lady there that was paralyzed and we just prayed for her and prayed for that luciferous thing to come out of her and she got released in front of everybody.
[02:21:42.810 --> 02:21:44.331]  A miracle happened in front of everybody.
[02:21:44.611 --> 02:21:47.332]  So we've seen heart attacks, people that have issues with the vaccine.
[02:21:47.812 --> 02:21:48.852]  Prayer works.
[02:21:49.132 --> 02:21:49.472]  Why?
[02:21:49.852 --> 02:21:51.673]  Because this stuff is demonic.
[02:21:52.253 --> 02:21:56.837]  When something is luciferous, at the mention of the name of Jesus, it has to be uprooted.
[02:21:57.297 --> 02:22:06.205]  So if you go on our website, there's a place for prayer, that you can actually pull up that prayer, pray to regenerate your DNA, the same way Christ regenerated...
[02:22:08.447 --> 02:22:14.135]  Even if you don't believe in God, which we know is real, you're ordering your spirit that's in control of your body, you're ordering your body to do something.
[02:22:14.195 --> 02:22:14.476]  Yes!
[02:22:14.695 --> 02:22:23.255]   If you go into like 1 Peter 3 verse 5 says salvation is by the washing of regeneration
[02:22:23.255 --> 02:22:28.375]   and the renewing of the Holy Ghost. What happened in the Garden of Eden was a DNA corruption,
[02:22:28.375 --> 02:22:29.976]  a spiritual DNA corruption.
[02:22:30.235 --> 02:22:33.278]  That is why we all come down from that lineage and we're all crazy as human beings.
[02:22:33.878 --> 02:22:37.061]  But when you pray, you regenerate your DNA.
[02:22:37.101 --> 02:22:38.482]  So you deal with the spiritual part.
[02:22:38.662 --> 02:22:39.363]  You're baptized.
[02:22:39.683 --> 02:22:39.923]  Yes.
[02:22:40.484 --> 02:22:40.844]  Stay there.
[02:22:40.864 --> 02:22:42.686]  Dr. Sill Emanuel is on fire!
[02:22:44.113 --> 02:22:44.773]  Hallelujah!
[02:22:45.534 --> 02:22:50.796]  If you think gun control or something like that is going to change a terrorist's point of view, I think you're, like, out of your mind.
[02:22:51.596 --> 02:22:54.418]  You may think you've got me worried about what you're going to do.
[02:22:54.558 --> 02:22:57.179]  Dude, you're about to find out what I'm going to do.
[02:22:57.239 --> 02:22:58.900]  And that's going to worry you a lot more.
[02:22:59.240 --> 02:23:02.381]  Lawdog, if you don't step aside, we'll tear you apart.
[02:23:04.462 --> 02:23:05.562]  You die first, get it?
[02:23:06.803 --> 02:23:12.005]  Your friends might get me in a rush, but not before I make your head into a canoe, you understand me?
[02:23:12.045 --> 02:23:13.206]  He's bluffing, let's rush him.
[02:23:13.326 --> 02:23:13.406]  No!
[02:23:14.901 --> 02:23:17.303]  You're not as stupid as you look, Ike.
[02:23:17.863 --> 02:23:21.746]  Yeah, I don't understand the concepts of conversation of the gun culture.
[02:23:22.407 --> 02:23:26.750]  We've lived with guns since, what, the 7th century or something, I don't know.
[02:23:26.970 --> 02:23:32.694]  We all know that right now, guns is a totem, it's a metaphor that disenfranchises white guys' need.
[02:23:32.754 --> 02:23:34.275]  It makes them feel good because they're being proud of it.
[02:23:34.295 --> 02:23:35.836]  You can say what you want, I don't agree with that.
[02:23:35.856 --> 02:23:37.157]  There's a big difference between fantasy land...
[02:23:38.278 --> 02:23:40.259]  In reality, Fantasyland is what we do.
[02:23:40.319 --> 02:23:43.121]  Doing a movie, doing a television show, that's Fantasyland.
[02:23:43.201 --> 02:23:44.742]  And that's where that stuff belongs.
[02:23:44.902 --> 02:23:51.987]  In reality, when we're dealing with things like terrorism and whatnot, we're all gonna have different opinions on how to do it, how to deal with it.
[02:23:52.127 --> 02:24:05.095]  Mine happens to be that I think there's a very strong reason Founding Fathers had for the Second Amendment, and that is that no government ever hasn't had to fight its own people, and its own people hasn't had to fight its own government.
[02:24:05.355 --> 02:24:06.296]  So what are you gonna do?
[02:24:06.316 --> 02:24:06.856]  Outlaw everything?
[02:24:07.156 --> 02:24:07.877]  That isn't the answer.
[02:24:08.137 --> 02:24:11.639]  They just put some controls.
[02:24:11.879 --> 02:24:12.460]  What?
[02:24:12.500 --> 02:24:16.062]  So the people who want to defend themselves can't?
[02:24:16.402 --> 02:24:17.603]  No, not so you can't.
[02:24:17.623 --> 02:24:19.264]  Just so the idiots can't get hold of us.
[02:24:19.545 --> 02:24:21.346]  Do you really believe they're not going to?
[02:24:21.486 --> 02:24:22.507]  Are you serious about that?
[02:24:23.127 --> 02:24:23.928]  Are you seriously?
[02:24:24.369 --> 02:24:24.529]  What?
[02:24:24.649 --> 02:24:25.410]  Good will that?
[02:24:25.570 --> 02:24:26.971]  Oh my God.
[02:24:27.933 --> 02:24:29.414]  We had our Civil War.
[02:24:29.474 --> 02:24:38.264]  If that Second Amendment hadn't been there, those people would not have had the opportunity to do what they considered was defending their life, their way, their style of living.
[02:24:38.885 --> 02:24:40.747]  So I agree with that.
[02:24:40.827 --> 02:24:42.949]  I think that's an important part of our existence.
[02:24:42.969 --> 02:24:44.351]  It's basically that simple.
[02:24:48.284 --> 02:24:52.688]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:24:53.048 --> 02:24:57.692]  Yeah, InfoWars.com, our ex-channel, banned out video are on fire!
[02:24:58.703 --> 02:25:04.946]  And I had great Doc Chambers and Michael Yonah in last hour, and you can feel the momentum shift, you can feel the victory.
[02:25:05.367 --> 02:25:07.888]  Doesn't mean we're winning the war yet, but we're winning the battles now.
[02:25:07.908 --> 02:25:19.074]  Dr. Settle Emanuel, before we get into protecting ourselves, the great products you've got at DrSettleEmanuel.com, the promo code Alex, supports the show, supports everybody, 360WIN.
[02:25:19.514 --> 02:25:25.037]  You lead major prayer revivals out of your ranch, you're a woman of God, I can feel the Holy Spirit with you right now.
[02:25:25.598 --> 02:25:28.019]  Talk about God and the fight we're against, and lead us in some prayer.
[02:25:29.562 --> 02:25:37.888]  We are doing a monthly deliverance service and the reason why we do that is because a lot of people are fighting a battle that is spiritual and they don't know how to fight back.
[02:25:38.389 --> 02:25:45.334]  So we have a ranch in just outside Paterson, it's about two hours from here, and people come there and they stay for free.
[02:25:45.594 --> 02:25:54.481]  They come three, four, five days and they stay there and we pray with them and they deal with depression, drug addiction, just a lot of spiritual stuff that people cannot handle by themselves.
[02:25:54.941 --> 02:25:55.822]  And it's totally free.
[02:25:55.862 --> 02:26:00.526]  So whatever you do on our website, whatever we do, we try to do this stuff free for people.
[02:26:00.546 --> 02:26:02.849]  So they come there, they stay for free, they don't have to pay rent or anything.
[02:26:03.429 --> 02:26:08.854]  And not only that, we also have a food pantry where people can come and get food for free and everything.
[02:26:08.894 --> 02:26:11.277]  So we're trying our best to help people.
[02:26:11.777 --> 02:26:12.738]  A biblical system.
[02:26:12.758 --> 02:26:16.301]  And look, Roger Stone wasn't really an atheist, but he didn't really believe in God.
[02:26:16.341 --> 02:26:19.584]  When he got totally in trouble, some Christians came and prayed with him.
[02:26:20.325 --> 02:26:22.667]  And he calls me all the time talking about Jesus and crying.
[02:26:22.727 --> 02:26:23.608]  I mean, it's real.
[02:26:24.108 --> 02:26:27.591]  And literally, the day he gave his life to God, everything changed the next day.
[02:26:27.811 --> 02:26:28.412]  Yes, yes.
[02:26:28.472 --> 02:26:29.533]  I speak to Roger all the time.
[02:26:29.573 --> 02:26:30.193]  He's amazing.
[02:26:31.194 --> 02:26:32.375]  So you know how he is?
[02:26:32.455 --> 02:26:32.695]  Yes.
[02:26:32.775 --> 02:26:43.844]  We've started, because the election is coming and it's going to be crazy, we started doing a space at 8pm at night on X to actually pray for the election, pray for President Trump.
[02:26:43.884 --> 02:26:50.729]   If you go on my X handle, Go on my ex-handle, you can like actually sign up to come for the speech.
[02:26:50.790 --> 02:26:51.690]  And what is your ex-handle?
[02:26:52.511 --> 02:26:54.733]  Stella underscore Emmanuel.
[02:26:55.313 --> 02:26:55.693]  Beautiful.
[02:26:55.913 --> 02:27:02.158]  Yeah, so that we can pray for the election, pray for these demons and pray for them to, for their plan.
[02:27:02.258 --> 02:27:03.900]  That's right, we're supposed to pray for them, not hate them.
[02:27:05.581 --> 02:27:06.482]  They want the hate back.
[02:27:06.522 --> 02:27:08.985]  Jesus said to give them love.
[02:27:09.265 --> 02:27:10.266]  Heaps of coals on their backs.
[02:27:10.547 --> 02:27:12.068]  It depends whether they are human or not.
[02:27:12.348 --> 02:27:14.651]  If they are human, we love them and bring them to Christ.
[02:27:14.771 --> 02:27:19.476]  If they are non-human, and a lot of them are non-human, we release the fire of God to consume them.
[02:27:19.917 --> 02:27:21.879]  Explain that and then talk about...
[02:27:23.786 --> 02:27:28.432]  Talk about why they fear Trump so much.
[02:27:29.313 --> 02:27:29.934]  He's not perfect.
[02:27:29.974 --> 02:27:30.435]  I'm not either.
[02:27:30.795 --> 02:27:33.419]  They legitimately are scared of him and Tucker Carlson.
[02:27:33.679 --> 02:27:34.900]  And they're scared of me and they're scared of you.
[02:27:34.961 --> 02:27:35.802]  What is it they're scared of?
[02:27:36.643 --> 02:27:41.910]  They don't want people that are going to stand and bring the people to, for people's minds to open.
[02:27:42.450 --> 02:27:45.592]  I tell people... So the thing is, we're not afraid of what they're afraid of?
[02:27:45.772 --> 02:27:46.533]  Yes.
[02:27:47.013 --> 02:27:52.636]  I tell people about President Trump, they're like, well, President Trump, whether he's a Christian or not, that doesn't matter.
[02:27:52.716 --> 02:27:53.737]  We're not looking for a pastor.
[02:27:53.777 --> 02:27:54.677]  He's been risen up.
[02:27:54.997 --> 02:27:56.278]  We're not even looking for a pastor.
[02:27:56.678 --> 02:27:57.879]  We're looking for a president.
[02:27:57.899 --> 02:28:04.103]  See, God calls people in a position of leadership, like the Pharaoh in the days of Joseph.
[02:28:04.123 --> 02:28:06.504]  So many times he calls somebody that isn't even good.
[02:28:06.564 --> 02:28:11.407]  Yes, Nebuchadnezzar was... The fourth chapter of Daniel was written by Nebuchadnezzar.
[02:28:11.607 --> 02:28:15.850]  Nebuchadnezzar was a Babylonian king, and Cyrus was called a servant of God.
[02:28:16.150 --> 02:28:18.511]  So whether Trump is a Christian or not, it doesn't matter.
[02:28:18.571 --> 02:28:19.732]  And I know he is.
[02:28:19.912 --> 02:28:21.193]  At least he's Presbyterian.
[02:28:21.213 --> 02:28:23.855]  But what you're saying is if God chooses you, you don't have a choice.
[02:28:24.195 --> 02:28:27.257]  God chooses people all the time to work.
[02:28:27.357 --> 02:28:30.659]  And you can see that the anointing of the president... That happened to me.
[02:28:30.739 --> 02:28:33.641]  I was always a Christian, but God literally said, you're doing this.
[02:28:33.961 --> 02:28:37.363]  You know that President Trump has the anointing of the president.
[02:28:37.383 --> 02:28:38.364]  You can feel it.
[02:28:38.384 --> 02:28:38.924]  You can see it.
[02:28:39.164 --> 02:28:39.905]  He's a king!
[02:28:39.724 --> 02:28:46.724]   that he's a king. Yes, the anointing is upon him. It's not on Biden, the bumbling fool that we have in the White House.
[02:28:46.724 --> 02:28:51.724]   And we have to pray if we're going to be able to bring God's plan for the nation.
[02:28:51.724 --> 02:28:55.724]   The Lord told us yesterday. So that's why they're so scared is they can see the anointing.
[02:28:55.724 --> 02:29:03.724]   Yes, and they know that he knows what they are doing and he has a call to actually dismantle their system.
[02:29:03.212 --> 02:29:04.152]  That's why they're scared of him.
[02:29:04.453 --> 02:29:06.894]  And that's why no weapon formed against him prospers.
[02:29:07.114 --> 02:29:08.775]  Yes, no matter what they do.
[02:29:09.095 --> 02:29:13.598]  Because when God anoints you and calls you, he protects you, and it doesn't matter.
[02:29:13.818 --> 02:29:17.180]  They tried to destroy me, but I still rise, because they didn't call me.
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:18.781]  They tried to silence me.
[02:29:18.941 --> 02:29:21.941]   They didn't give me my... You were talking in the break about feeling the Holy Spirit together
[02:29:21.941 --> 02:29:26.780]   when the brethren are together. I can feel God's will. It's not even me. It's like you're doing this.
[02:29:26.780 --> 02:29:29.820]   Once you just submit to His will, then you do what He needs to do.
[02:29:29.820 --> 02:29:32.661]   There are people God is calling in this time, and guess what?
[02:29:32.661 --> 02:29:35.701]   People are coming to the Lord. Look at Jorogun already reading the Bible.
[02:29:35.701 --> 02:29:38.541]   Y'all need to lead him to Christ. Now he's suddenly talking about...
[02:29:38.541 --> 02:29:41.581]   Somebody needs to lead him to Christ. He's now... he's coming there.
[02:29:41.581 --> 02:29:43.140]  Yeah, because he's reading the Bible and talking...
[02:29:43.102 --> 02:29:47.326]  I'm like, Joe Rogan reading the Bible and cursing, but somebody needs to just truly lead him to Christ.
[02:29:47.587 --> 02:29:52.471]  Because there are people like him that have been caught, that are waiting... He'll be like Saul of Tarsus.
[02:29:52.551 --> 02:29:53.032]  Yes!
[02:29:53.452 --> 02:29:56.175]  Joe Rogan will be on fire once they lead him to Christ.
[02:29:56.215 --> 02:29:57.496]  So, can you guys do it, please?
[02:29:58.345 --> 02:29:58.845]  I'm trying.
[02:29:58.865 --> 02:30:01.367]  Can you imagine Joe Rogan once he gets the Holy Spirit?
[02:30:01.527 --> 02:30:03.629]  I'll be praying for him that he will give his life to Christ.
[02:30:03.669 --> 02:30:05.770]  Because he's beginning to get it.
[02:30:06.030 --> 02:30:12.154]  He's talking about Gilgamesh, and talking about the Tower of Babel, and talking about Revelation 6, and the Mark of the Beast.
[02:30:12.194 --> 02:30:13.495]  And he has just gone about God-dom.
[02:30:13.515 --> 02:30:13.895]  Yes!
[02:30:13.955 --> 02:30:17.678]  So he needs to, once he, God finally just connected him.
[02:30:17.698 --> 02:30:19.039]  It's like, come to the flame, join us.
[02:30:19.419 --> 02:30:19.619]  Yes.
[02:30:19.939 --> 02:30:21.701]  Even, what's his name, the British guy?
[02:30:21.761 --> 02:30:22.941]  He's talking about Jesus now.
[02:30:22.961 --> 02:30:23.742]  He's talking about God.
[02:30:24.302 --> 02:30:24.803]  What's his name?
[02:30:25.123 --> 02:30:28.265]  He used to be in Hollywood, and now he's a British podcaster.
[02:30:28.525 --> 02:30:29.026]  Russell Brand.
[02:30:29.046 --> 02:30:29.646]  Russell Brand.
[02:30:29.886 --> 02:30:32.568]  Russell Brand is like... I was on the show for three hours.
[02:30:32.608 --> 02:30:35.751]  He just sat there and listened to me, and he said, no, I believe in God now.
[02:30:35.851 --> 02:30:36.251]  Yes!
[02:30:36.451 --> 02:30:40.915]  I mean, so God, this whole battle is calling... Because you see it, it's all spiritual.
[02:30:40.935 --> 02:30:45.919]  People know that evil is coming, and what can solve evil is God.
[02:30:46.379 --> 02:30:51.163]  And if you are there and you don't know what to do... That's right, evil is coming because we forgot God.
[02:30:51.383 --> 02:30:52.563]  Yes, that is why.
[02:30:53.043 --> 02:30:54.224]  Call on the name of Jesus.
[02:30:54.244 --> 02:30:58.525]  You see, whenever people turn away from God, God gave them into captivity.
[02:30:58.585 --> 02:31:00.525]  God gave them in the hands of their enemies.
[02:31:00.625 --> 02:31:00.845]  Yes.
[02:31:01.426 --> 02:31:05.347]  So, Father, I just want to pray for everybody listening to the sound of my voice.
[02:31:05.907 --> 02:31:10.448]  That the veil will come off your mind and you will see the glorious light of the Gospel.
[02:31:10.868 --> 02:31:15.153]  That Jesus, you will touch the hearts of people all over the world, all over the nation.
[02:31:15.453 --> 02:31:18.456]  That the hearts of the nations will come back to you in the name of Jesus.
[02:31:18.857 --> 02:31:21.399]  I pray, I rebuke the spirit of fear.
[02:31:21.700 --> 02:31:27.426]  That your people will not be fearful, but they will arise and stand strong in the name of Jesus.
[02:31:27.506 --> 02:31:29.348]  I pray for the church to wake up.
[02:31:29.768 --> 02:31:31.630]  And begin to pray and seek your face.
[02:31:31.650 --> 02:31:39.237]  Your word says that if my people that are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek your face and turn from their wicked ways.
[02:31:39.277 --> 02:31:42.960]  Lord you say you will hear from heaven, you will forgive our sins and heal our land.
[02:31:43.281 --> 02:31:45.683]  I pray father that you begin to draw us to you.
[02:31:46.043 --> 02:31:51.148]  Draw the church to you and start exposing all the false prophets that are taking people away from you.
[02:31:51.568 --> 02:32:06.653]  And the remnants, oh God, even the patriots that are fighting in the frontline, that your hand of protection will be upon them, upon Alex, upon everybody that is standing and holding the baton in this frontline battle in the name of Jesus, that your hand will be upon them.
[02:32:06.993 --> 02:32:10.855]  I pray that you will start just drawing them closer to you in the name of Jesus.
[02:32:11.235 --> 02:32:14.356]  I pray for the peace of America, that you will restore this nation.
[02:32:14.616 --> 02:32:16.136]  I pray for the peace of Jerusalem.
[02:32:16.216 --> 02:32:18.697]  I pray for peace over the world in the name of Jesus.
[02:32:19.057 --> 02:32:20.678]  King of glory, we give you praise.
[02:32:21.058 --> 02:32:24.387]  And I pray that the blood will be released on our behalf, in Jesus' name.
[02:32:24.587 --> 02:32:24.888]  Amen.
[02:32:24.908 --> 02:32:27.315]  And that blood's unstoppable.
[02:32:27.395 --> 02:32:27.656]  Yes.
[02:32:27.916 --> 02:32:29.581]  The blood of Jesus will be released.
[02:32:30.691 --> 02:32:31.372]  Hallelujah!
[02:32:31.972 --> 02:32:34.994]  Alex, I just pray for God's hand of protection upon you.
[02:32:35.575 --> 02:32:39.458]  That He will just build... The Bible says that Jerusalem was a city without walls.
[02:32:39.838 --> 02:32:41.299]  That God will build a wall of fire.
[02:32:41.399 --> 02:32:43.380]  That God will build a wall of fire around you.
[02:32:43.821 --> 02:32:46.423]  Release angels to watch over you and protect you.
[02:32:46.963 --> 02:32:49.985]  And just give you wisdom to do the work that you're doing.
[02:32:50.426 --> 02:32:51.026]  I can feel it!
[02:32:51.086 --> 02:32:52.948]  Yes, and His hand will be upon your life.
[02:32:52.968 --> 02:32:53.888]  I pray for you all the time.
[02:32:53.928 --> 02:32:54.669]  I'm sure you know that.
[02:32:55.129 --> 02:32:55.830]  Oh no, thank you so much.
[02:32:55.850 --> 02:32:59.912]  Yeah, when I see something going, I'll be like, oh God, protect Alex, watch over him.
[02:33:00.492 --> 02:33:02.353]  And you know, so we just have to pray.
[02:33:02.433 --> 02:33:05.395]  And that is why we start doing that 8pm on Sunday nights.
[02:33:05.915 --> 02:33:08.596]  We're gonna have, we're gonna be praying till the election.
[02:33:08.977 --> 02:33:09.877]  Praying for the election.
[02:33:10.177 --> 02:33:12.659]  Praying to, you know, to set confusion.
[02:33:12.699 --> 02:33:14.700]  And that's why they try to shut down the churches during COVID.
[02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:16.881]  Yes, set confusion and expose them, yeah.
[02:33:16.961 --> 02:33:18.202]  Alright, we'll come right back.
[02:33:18.382 --> 02:33:20.123]  Wow, we got more to cover.
[02:33:21.383 --> 02:33:24.908]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[02:33:25.308 --> 02:33:32.338]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of, is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[02:33:32.498 --> 02:33:34.501]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[02:33:34.681 --> 02:33:35.763]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[02:33:35.823 --> 02:33:36.484]  He loved the idea.
[02:33:36.804 --> 02:33:40.326]  What would you call the debates and discussions about a pro-human future?
[02:33:40.346 --> 02:33:41.226]  Just Team Humanity?
[02:33:41.286 --> 02:33:42.167]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[02:33:42.327 --> 02:33:42.767]  Absolutely.
[02:33:43.087 --> 02:33:44.468]  And so, we have the t-shirt.
[02:33:44.548 --> 02:33:47.970]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family, standing against the globalists.
[02:33:48.210 --> 02:33:55.654]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air, so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[02:33:55.934 --> 02:34:07.639]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[02:34:07.919 --> 02:34:09.240]  We're told humans are the problem.
[02:34:09.260 --> 02:34:10.260]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[02:34:10.540 --> 02:34:14.802]  We're told all this garbage, so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[02:34:15.102 --> 02:34:15.823]  We're not going to do that.
[02:34:16.063 --> 02:34:20.705]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at InfoWarsTore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[02:34:21.565 --> 02:34:25.447]  Oh, you're right, Dr. Stella, explain it to people right now.
[02:34:26.048 --> 02:34:27.348]  Explain what we're really facing.
[02:34:27.648 --> 02:34:27.869]  Go ahead.
[02:34:27.889 --> 02:34:29.449]  Say what we were saying during the break.
[02:34:29.970 --> 02:34:31.190]  Yeah, I'm saying that right.
[02:34:31.250 --> 02:34:34.032]  We're dealing with an invasion from the outer world.
[02:34:34.072 --> 02:34:37.194]  You know, in 2012, we had this 100-day prayer program.
[02:34:37.494 --> 02:34:39.115]  We prayed for 100 days non-stop.
[02:34:39.735 --> 02:34:49.981]  On day 99, I had a dream and these people came and they said they were genetically modified human beings and it was not their time yet, that when it's their time, they would manifest.
[02:34:50.300 --> 02:34:52.900]   And the Lord told me that... - These are the days of Noah, they were not...
[02:34:52.900 --> 02:34:55.400]  Yes, that in 2016 the world would change.
[02:34:55.400 --> 02:35:00.200]   So do you know in June 2016, that is when CERN opened that hydrocollider?
[02:35:00.200 --> 02:35:01.501]  And something came out.
[02:35:01.501 --> 02:35:04.899]   Because if you read in the book of Revelation chapter 9, it talks about
[02:35:04.899 --> 02:35:10.900]   that there's going to be an invasion where locusts will come from the underworld.
[02:35:10.957 --> 02:35:11.898]  The gates of hell will be open.
[02:35:11.918 --> 02:35:12.878]  The gates of hell will be open.
[02:35:13.359 --> 02:35:17.941]  And on that place that they are talking about is that the king over there will be Apollo, Apollyon.
[02:35:18.381 --> 02:35:19.781]  But guess where Sun is built?
[02:35:20.122 --> 02:35:21.362]  On the temple of Apollo.
[02:35:22.062 --> 02:35:23.143]  So this stuff is real.
[02:35:23.203 --> 02:35:25.024]  And they did satanic rituals when it opened.
[02:35:25.204 --> 02:35:25.504]  Yes!
[02:35:25.664 --> 02:35:31.006]  And not only that, it has the image of Shiva, the god of destruction, in front of Sun.
[02:35:31.527 --> 02:35:33.428]  Guess where the internet came from?
[02:35:33.468 --> 02:35:34.148]  The World Wide Web.
[02:35:34.716 --> 02:35:35.317]  From CERN.
[02:35:35.977 --> 02:35:37.138]  WWW, guess what?
[02:35:37.679 --> 02:35:39.760]  WWW actually means 666.
[02:35:40.181 --> 02:35:51.550]  So, and you know, in the days of Noah, you know, after Noah built the Tower of Babel, they wanted to connect all human beings to have one language and do things together.
[02:35:51.570 --> 02:35:59.217]  So right now, with the WWW World Wide Web, they are trying to connect all of us so that we can do things together and have that hive mind and demonic mindset.
[02:35:59.577 --> 02:36:01.278]  And that is why the web started.
[02:36:01.439 --> 02:36:02.640]  And that is part of their plan.
[02:36:03.180 --> 02:36:07.643]  So in 2012, the Lord showed me that there were going to be people among us that are non-humans.
[02:36:08.023 --> 02:36:26.173]  If you read in the book of Revelation, chapter 13, verse 14, it said that the devil would deceive human beings, that they will make images onto the devil, and the devil will have power to give breath to these images, that the images will be able to speak.
[02:36:26.773 --> 02:36:29.375]  And cost those that will not take the mark to be destroyed.
[02:36:29.856 --> 02:36:31.397]  So, what are images?
[02:36:31.638 --> 02:36:33.900]  Images is like clones or images.
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:35.741]  So, they were going to make images.
[02:36:35.841 --> 02:36:41.166]  Something that is non-human and the devil will be able to give breath to this image.
[02:36:41.566 --> 02:36:47.011]  And this image will start forcing people to, you know, kill people, you know, stop forcing them to take jabs and all kinds of things.
[02:36:47.372 --> 02:36:50.895]  So, there are people among us that are non-human and human beings need to know that.
[02:36:51.395 --> 02:36:58.160]  If you read in the book of Daniel chapter 2 verse 43, it talks about the last kingdom is going to be iron mixed with clay.
[02:36:58.461 --> 02:37:01.783]  It's going to be humans, which is clay, and iron, which is machine.
[02:37:02.143 --> 02:37:05.926]  And we hear right now about all kinds of people trying to mix iron with machine.
[02:37:06.307 --> 02:37:14.873]  Yuval Noah says that the next race, in the next few years, humans are not going to be in charge of the world, but they're going to be a different race.
[02:37:15.374 --> 02:37:17.115]  So, I started saying this in 2020.
[02:37:18.726 --> 02:37:22.229]  That COVID was a Trojan horse for the vaccine.
[02:37:22.669 --> 02:37:27.093]  And the vaccine is a Trojan horse for transhumanism or Human 2.0.
[02:37:27.413 --> 02:37:36.540]  That is why, if you look at it, the vaccine has mRNA messenger RNA that actually installs foreign DNA into you, changing you into Human 2.0.
[02:37:37.101 --> 02:37:51.113]   But I tell everybody that got vaccinated, If they put Lucifer in you, the Bible says in Titus 3 verse 5, that salvation is by the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost.
[02:37:51.493 --> 02:37:52.994]  So we have a prayer on our website.
[02:37:53.014 --> 02:37:56.037]  If you go to drstellaMD.com, you will see there, did you take the jab?
[02:37:56.097 --> 02:37:56.998]  Do you regret it?
[02:37:57.558 --> 02:38:00.300]  All you have to do is repent and tell God, Lord, I'm sorry.
[02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:01.381]  I was deceived.
[02:38:01.441 --> 02:38:02.162]  I was fearful.
[02:38:02.202 --> 02:38:03.042]  I needed my job.
[02:38:03.343 --> 02:38:05.945]  But right now, I'm coming back to you in repentance.
[02:38:06.325 --> 02:38:12.470]  The same way we repent to be saved is the same way you repent for this junk to be taken out of your system spiritually.
[02:38:12.990 --> 02:38:15.411]  So when you pray, we have the prayers.
[02:38:15.451 --> 02:38:17.612]  You pray for the blood of Jesus to flow through you.
[02:38:17.872 --> 02:38:19.973]  You pray for a regeneration of your DNA.
[02:38:20.153 --> 02:38:21.494]  And like I said, we've seen miracles.
[02:38:22.054 --> 02:38:30.598]  When you finish that prayer, then the next thing you do, we have a Vax Detox to help you deal with the physical effect of the vaccine, of the of the jab.
[02:38:30.618 --> 02:38:34.720]  So if you go on our website and you get the Vax Detox, it will help you to deal with the physical effect.
[02:38:35.020 --> 02:38:37.902]  But the most thing you need to do is deal with the spiritual effect.
[02:38:38.542 --> 02:38:43.506]  When the Bible says that we're in a time in the last days, it's gonna be like in the days of Noah.
[02:38:43.786 --> 02:38:44.907]  What happened in the days of Noah?
[02:38:45.187 --> 02:38:47.449]  There were Nephilim, there were non-humans among us.
[02:38:47.869 --> 02:38:57.056]  Some of this evil that they are doing, when you see a grown-up man dressed with diapers and tutu and dancing in front of a two-year-old child, they cannot possibly be human.
[02:38:57.396 --> 02:39:00.679]  So if we realize that we're dealing with non-humans... And they dress up like aliens.
[02:39:00.799 --> 02:39:02.220]  Yes, they just look like aliens.
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:03.200]  They look like aliens.
[02:39:03.220 --> 02:39:04.801]  They act like aliens.
[02:39:04.881 --> 02:39:05.501]  I'll get the clown.
[02:39:05.521 --> 02:39:07.642]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds with Dr. Shell Emanuel.
[02:39:07.662 --> 02:39:08.123]  Stay with us.
[02:39:08.443 --> 02:39:09.843]  DrShellEmanuelMD.com.
[02:39:11.204 --> 02:39:12.645]  Dr. Shell Emanuel is our guest.
[02:39:12.705 --> 02:39:13.545]  He's still here in the break.
[02:39:13.585 --> 02:39:15.166]  Joe Rogan, he's given his life to Jesus.
[02:39:15.186 --> 02:39:17.627]  He's talking about God, the devil now.
[02:39:18.147 --> 02:39:25.191]  It's a bigger trip than DMT, folks, to meet Christ and the Holy Spirit, but given the discernment, the connection to infinity.
[02:39:27.908 --> 02:39:34.510]  I was going to have a great guest in here, but I've got a not a bad family emergency, but a family emergency I have to deal with.
[02:39:35.871 --> 02:39:38.792]  I rarely punch out early to go deal with it, but I got to deal with this.
[02:39:39.812 --> 02:39:42.493]  And so hopefully I'll be back tomorrow, but this is all going down.
[02:39:42.513 --> 02:39:46.975]  So I'm going to air the incredible Alex Jones, Tucker Carlson interview was part of it.
[02:39:47.573 --> 02:39:52.773]   Tucker sent us a clip earlier. Yeah, he's got the Putin interview. He's building the suspense for that.
[02:39:52.773 --> 02:39:56.373]   I asked him today, "Did you get it?" and he sent me this clip.
[02:39:56.373 --> 02:40:00.773]   So that's coming up. We're gonna put that on X right now or it's already up there right now.
[02:40:00.773 --> 02:40:08.173]   But Dr. Stella, in the nine minutes we have left, I'm proud to have you on here exposing the evil.
[02:40:08.173 --> 02:40:10.173]  But also, we're not just pitching something.
[02:40:10.297 --> 02:40:18.102]  We want to pitch things that empower you, that make you healthier and wiser and better, and plus you want to get it again.
[02:40:18.122 --> 02:40:24.566]  I never thought of this from an evil perspective, but the evil sells something that doesn't work, like a Chinese product.
[02:40:24.626 --> 02:40:25.207]  Why would you want that?
[02:40:25.227 --> 02:40:29.509]  I want to sell something that is known for quality because you want to get it again.
[02:40:29.549 --> 02:40:30.630]  I want a relationship with you.
[02:40:32.131 --> 02:40:34.632]  Telemedicine for stuff you can't get over the counter.
[02:40:34.652 --> 02:40:36.332]  We've got also the best supplements ever.
[02:40:36.753 --> 02:40:38.093]  Talk about the products right now.
[02:40:39.233 --> 02:40:45.376]  We, over the past four years, have gone from not just being a doctor, but being a doctor that also do natural medicine.
[02:40:45.736 --> 02:40:55.599]  In fact, one of the things that we've added on our website are nice medicinal herbs like moringa, curcumin, turmeric, ginger, and you can drink them in a tea and you get healthy.
[02:40:56.498 --> 02:40:58.060]  DrStellaMD.com.
[02:40:58.100 --> 02:41:00.363]  Yes, and if they use promo code Alex, they get a discount.
[02:41:01.043 --> 02:41:09.693]  When they talk about Ebola and Zika and all this stuff, you see these two supplements right here, Covilite and Vira Immune Plus?
[02:41:10.374 --> 02:41:12.556]  These two are something you mix and drink.
[02:41:13.533 --> 02:41:17.395]  And with things like that, hydration is very important.
[02:41:17.795 --> 02:41:23.417]  We put together Covilight for people that had like brain fog from COVID or people just feel drained and everything.
[02:41:23.838 --> 02:41:25.538]  So it has all the vitamins you need.
[02:41:25.578 --> 02:41:26.699]  It has the minerals you need.
[02:41:27.019 --> 02:41:29.720]  It has things like resveratrol for DNA repair.
[02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:30.841]  It has CoQ10.
[02:41:31.201 --> 02:41:32.121]  It has ginseng.
[02:41:32.201 --> 02:41:33.682]  It has all kinds of stuff.
[02:41:34.042 --> 02:41:39.505]   So between these two products, you can get about, build your immunity on about everything that is They can throw at you.
[02:41:39.985 --> 02:41:46.468]  But if people don't want that because you see, COVID-19 has guarana and guarana is like a natural occurring caffeine and just gives you a lot of energy.
[02:41:46.909 --> 02:41:47.929]  You can use Covivite.
[02:41:48.029 --> 02:41:54.773]  We have thousands of people taking our Covivite every day, which is kind of kept them healthy and sovereign from being sick.
[02:41:55.113 --> 02:42:00.276]  You can go to our website, drsellamd.com, go to the marketplace and stock up.
[02:42:00.416 --> 02:42:02.557]  We actually have plandemic packs right there.
[02:42:02.957 --> 02:42:05.499]  We have just about everything you need.
[02:42:05.939 --> 02:42:07.300]  And buy them, stock them up.
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:08.900]  Take Covivite daily.
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:10.921]  Vitamin C, D, Zinc and Quercetin.
[02:42:11.241 --> 02:42:14.002]  We have put it in the amount that is necessary for you.
[02:42:14.602 --> 02:42:17.403]  Covilite, everybody loves it because it gives you energy.
[02:42:17.503 --> 02:42:18.483]  It builds your immunity.
[02:42:18.963 --> 02:42:22.244]  But the medicinal herbs is a new thing that we've really added.
[02:42:22.384 --> 02:42:23.745]  And like Moringa.
[02:42:23.965 --> 02:42:25.445]  Moringa is antioxidant.
[02:42:25.846 --> 02:42:26.886]  It's anti-inflammatory.
[02:42:26.966 --> 02:42:30.007]  It helps to improve your sugar, improve your memory, improve your mood.
[02:42:30.527 --> 02:42:31.368]  Anti-bacteria.
[02:42:31.428 --> 02:42:33.912]  So this stuff is some good stuff.
[02:42:34.252 --> 02:42:35.313]  I drink them in a tea.
[02:42:35.454 --> 02:42:36.154]  I stay healthy.
[02:42:36.235 --> 02:42:36.875]  I don't get sick.
[02:42:37.196 --> 02:42:43.143]  My family members, when they get sick, they come running to my house because they know that I have all these things and I'm not gonna catch whatever that they bring.
[02:42:43.984 --> 02:42:45.566]  America, be prepared.
[02:42:46.636 --> 02:42:50.297]  Most important, get hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in your medicine cabinet today.
[02:42:50.838 --> 02:42:54.419]  Alex, we have something called seven antibiotics you will need in an emergency.
[02:42:54.759 --> 02:42:56.320]  What if supply chains go down?
[02:42:56.440 --> 02:42:59.461]  At least you have antibiotics for different kind of infections.
[02:42:59.821 --> 02:43:02.162]  You need a telemedicine appointment to do that.
[02:43:02.222 --> 02:43:05.703]  You need to go on our website, make a telemedicine appointment.
[02:43:05.984 --> 02:43:11.066]  We will see you, look at your medical information, and prescribe this stuff to you.
[02:43:11.426 --> 02:43:14.207]  And our mom and pop pharmacies all over the country will ship it to you.
[02:43:14.887 --> 02:43:23.191]  Please, please, don't wait till they throw Zika or they throw Ebola or they throw some kind of different strain of COVID and then you're suffering.
[02:43:23.451 --> 02:43:25.632]  Today, today, be prepared.
[02:43:25.692 --> 02:43:26.953]  That is, that is my cry.
[02:43:27.553 --> 02:43:31.515]  When you're prepared medically, you're not scared of whatever it is they're going to bring.
[02:43:32.015 --> 02:43:33.156]  Be prepared spiritually.
[02:43:33.196 --> 02:43:34.176]  Give your life to Jesus.
[02:43:34.676 --> 02:43:35.917]  Call on the name of Jesus.
[02:43:36.157 --> 02:43:37.058]  Read your Bible.
[02:43:37.278 --> 02:43:42.718]   know God for yourself so that way you're not scared because if you die in Christ
[02:43:42.718 --> 02:43:46.278]   is gain when you're in Christ and you know God you're not scared to die so
[02:43:46.278 --> 02:43:50.577]   you're not scared about whatever they are doing be prepared physically stock
[02:43:50.577 --> 02:43:55.878]   up food water get into communities and go out into the into the into the
[02:43:55.878 --> 02:44:01.757]   country and buy some land and build up where you can survive flashlights
[02:44:01.757 --> 02:44:07.257]   batteries and water filtration system rice and beans I tell people get your
[02:44:07.257 --> 02:44:11.397]   money out of the get your money out of the system because this system is gonna
[02:44:11.397 --> 02:44:15.837]   crash what all this battle that they are doing what I said the border whether is
[02:44:15.837 --> 02:44:24.582]   releasing prisoners to harass us or whether it's you know China and India are now trying to de-dollarize.
[02:44:24.582 --> 02:44:26.381]  It is all about destroying America.
[02:44:26.381 --> 02:44:27.682]  So the dollar is going to crash.
[02:44:27.682 --> 02:44:30.082]  When it crashes, how are you going to survive?
[02:44:30.082 --> 02:44:33.782]   Make sure that you have food stock up, your medical supplies are stock up,
[02:44:33.782 --> 02:44:35.982]  make sure that you're physically stock up.
[02:44:35.982 --> 02:44:37.382]  Go to the store.
[02:44:38.184 --> 02:44:39.085]  Go to wherever.
[02:44:39.325 --> 02:44:49.032]  Look at things that you need over-the-counter, whether it's Band-Aids, whether it's creams, steroid creams, whether it's, you know, things that you can tie your leg if somebody's leg gets broken or something.
[02:44:49.452 --> 02:44:52.814]  Make sure that you have over-the-counter medicines that you will need in an emergency.
[02:44:53.294 --> 02:44:55.436]  My whole idea is be prepared.
[02:44:55.836 --> 02:45:09.643]   If you follow me on Twitter, on my Twitter handle, Stella underscore Emmanuel, I talk about a lot of this preparedness stuff, both medical, physical, spiritual, and also in you know mentally prepared because we are mentally
[02:45:09.643 --> 02:45:14.384]   prepared you're not going to be scared of something is going to happen. They are going to try to
[02:45:14.384 --> 02:45:20.612]   take us out but we are going to fight back but we need to be able to fight back and stand. I don't
[02:45:20.612 --> 02:45:25.132]   want you to be fighting back and you can't breathe. People call me to come get them out of
[02:45:25.132 --> 02:45:27.083]  the hospital and it really hurts my soul.
[02:45:27.246 --> 02:45:28.287]  So that's what I tell people.
[02:45:28.467 --> 02:45:32.329]  Make sure you're prepared on that sense and just make sure you're prepared.
[02:45:32.609 --> 02:45:39.494]  If you go to DrStellaMD.com, you make a telemedicine appointment, get hydroxychloroquine, get ivermectin, put it in your medicine cabinet.
[02:45:39.774 --> 02:45:40.914]  In your medicine cabinet.
[02:45:41.275 --> 02:45:42.776]  Not when something happens.
[02:45:43.176 --> 02:45:44.156]  And make sure you're prepared.
[02:45:45.137 --> 02:45:52.746]  I feel so good about this because your products are amazing, your telemedicine is amazing, your information is amazing, and it funds our operation.
[02:45:52.806 --> 02:45:54.808]  A total 360 win.
[02:45:55.889 --> 02:45:59.934]  We're at a historical point now, and God gave us compounds and things that protect us.
[02:46:00.014 --> 02:46:03.758]  We need to use them, and people need to support independent media.
[02:46:03.798 --> 02:46:05.260]  Two minute closing comments, we've got a break.
[02:46:07.105 --> 02:46:15.288]  Listen, brothers and sisters, fellow Americans and the world, humanity, this battle that we're fighting is a battle for our survival.
[02:46:15.508 --> 02:46:20.390]  And I do believe that we are winning because we have managed somehow to keep them at bay.
[02:46:20.850 --> 02:46:24.532]  But when the devil starts getting desperate, they're going to do even more desperate stuff.
[02:46:25.012 --> 02:46:27.753]  One of the things you need to do is be part of the information war.
[02:46:28.333 --> 02:46:29.173]  Share everything.
[02:46:29.734 --> 02:46:30.054]  Read.
[02:46:30.194 --> 02:46:33.475]  Get to know what it is that they are doing so that you can stand.
[02:46:33.895 --> 02:46:37.556]  You can be able to stand and not fall out of fear.
[02:46:38.116 --> 02:46:38.637]  And pray.
[02:46:38.737 --> 02:46:39.717]  Pray for our nation.
[02:46:40.157 --> 02:46:41.638]  Pray for President Trump.
[02:46:41.898 --> 02:46:44.279]  Pray for the people that are in power.
[02:46:44.579 --> 02:46:50.921]  Pray that God would take out the rhinos and take out the swamp and put people in power that are really going to stand for the nation.
[02:46:51.461 --> 02:46:54.242]  And pray for the world because this battle is like a global battle.

[02:48:35.371 --> 02:48:37.732]  today, American Journal, 8 a.m.
[02:48:37.852 --> 02:48:40.134]  weekdays with the great Harrison Smith.
[02:48:40.154 --> 02:48:41.235]  I want to thank you all.
[02:48:41.715 --> 02:48:42.736]  Please stay with us.
[02:48:43.775 --> 02:48:47.360]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today, today, today.
[02:48:47.800 --> 02:48:52.907]  We're here with the world's most dangerous man, the most censored man in the English language.
[02:48:53.668 --> 02:48:58.074]  But honestly, when you get him in front of an outhouse in the woods, he doesn't seem so dangerous.
[02:48:58.935 --> 02:48:59.836]  It's a fancy outhouse.
[02:49:02.236 --> 02:49:11.082]  We have a ruling class in the United States defined by its hatreds, not its loves, not its hopes, but by its hatreds.
[02:49:11.222 --> 02:49:20.829]  They hate all kinds of people, large groups of people, the deplorables, the bitter clingers, America's entire blue-collar population, the unfashionable people.
[02:49:21.309 --> 02:49:23.671]  They're hated by the people who run our country.
[02:49:24.352 --> 02:49:28.694]  But no one is hated more by them than a man called Alex Jones.
[02:49:29.315 --> 02:49:34.197]  Alex Jones is the single most censored man in all American history.
[02:49:34.697 --> 02:49:38.259]  He was the first media figure in our history to be completely erased in one day.
[02:49:38.539 --> 02:49:39.480]  Deplatformed.
[02:49:39.620 --> 02:49:42.861]  Alex Jones was deplatformed before it was a common term.
[02:49:43.662 --> 02:49:45.022]  And not just deplatformed.
[02:49:45.663 --> 02:49:46.023]  Sued.
[02:49:47.143 --> 02:49:47.644]  Attacked.
[02:49:48.264 --> 02:49:50.045]  They attempted to criminally charge him.
[02:49:50.845 --> 02:49:52.206]  What did Alex Jones do wrong?
[02:49:53.098 --> 02:49:54.699]  Alex Jones didn't rape anybody.
[02:49:55.459 --> 02:49:56.620]  He didn't loot Macy's.
[02:49:57.040 --> 02:49:58.700]  He didn't burn a police station.
[02:49:59.201 --> 02:50:02.782]  He didn't invent a fake cryptocurrency and loot pension funds.
[02:50:02.802 --> 02:50:07.004]  He didn't start a pointless war that made this country poorer and more disorganized.
[02:50:07.024 --> 02:50:08.424]  He didn't open the southern border.
[02:50:08.505 --> 02:50:08.765]  No!
[02:50:09.485 --> 02:50:14.327]  Alex Jones had opinions that deeply rattled the people who run America.
[02:50:14.427 --> 02:50:15.728]  In fact, rattled a lot of us.
[02:50:15.808 --> 02:50:25.518]   And I'll just confess that I first heard of Alex Jones When he questioned the official story behind 9-11, and I, speaking for myself, was deeply offended by this.
[02:50:26.579 --> 02:50:40.930]  I didn't take any time to find out what he was saying, but I was bothered by the idea that this defining event in American history, which changed the life of everyone who lived here then, might not actually have unfolded as we were told it did.
[02:50:41.250 --> 02:50:43.431]  And that possibility was too destabilizing.
[02:50:43.451 --> 02:50:46.354]  And I remember feeling resentment toward Alex Jones for saying that.
[02:50:47.301 --> 02:50:54.004]  But several years later, I went up in Austin, Texas, and through a chain of circumstances, wound up meeting Alex Jones.
[02:50:54.805 --> 02:51:00.487]  And I learned what everyone who has met him now knows, which is Alex Jones is not a crazy person.
[02:51:00.927 --> 02:51:03.989]  Alex Jones has said pretty far out things on TV from time to time.
[02:51:04.838 --> 02:51:05.859]  Not that far out.
[02:51:06.039 --> 02:51:09.381]  He hasn't said men can become women, or Ukraine is a democracy.
[02:51:09.922 --> 02:51:12.724]  But within the bounds of, say, cable news, pretty far out.
[02:51:13.564 --> 02:51:17.187]  But fundamentally, Alex Jones is right about a lot of things.
[02:51:17.387 --> 02:51:19.148]  And in fact, that's why they don't like him.
[02:51:19.989 --> 02:51:25.613]  Alex Jones has an uncanny, really an amazing ability to predict events before they happen.
[02:51:25.713 --> 02:51:30.116]  He has called it and he's done it on tape again and again, to the point where it's a meme on the internet.
[02:51:30.617 --> 02:51:31.817]  Alex Jones profit.
[02:51:32.058 --> 02:51:33.679]  Not conspiracy nut, profit.
[02:51:34.625 --> 02:51:40.289]  But when you dig into Alex Jones's predictions, they are so spot-on that it's remarkable.
[02:51:40.849 --> 02:51:41.590]  How does he do this?
[02:51:41.870 --> 02:51:45.432]  We're guessing there's a kind of spiritual sensitivity to Alex Jones.
[02:51:45.452 --> 02:51:46.433]  Maybe that's his secret.
[02:51:47.354 --> 02:51:52.477]  He was displaying this years before the average person in this country even thought about matters like that.
[02:51:52.517 --> 02:52:01.763]  Now it's pretty obvious to most people that the current war going on in this country is taking place in ways you can't see it most of the time, but ten years ago people were not thinking that way.
[02:52:01.863 --> 02:52:02.544]  Alex Jones was.
[02:52:03.365 --> 02:52:07.147]  And so we thought it'd be interesting to sit down and talk to Alex Jones, the man.
[02:52:07.607 --> 02:52:08.867]  He joins us now in our studio.
[02:52:09.388 --> 02:52:10.088]  Alex Jones, thank you.
[02:52:10.428 --> 02:52:11.929]  Wow, Tucker, it's great to be here.
[02:52:12.069 --> 02:52:15.170]  Amazing studios, amazing, I mean, amazing people.
[02:52:15.730 --> 02:52:18.791]  And this is this is really going to be, I think, a historic interview.
[02:52:18.831 --> 02:52:19.772]  So thanks for having me.
[02:52:19.812 --> 02:52:21.993]  Well, I'm really grateful to be able to do it.
[02:52:22.033 --> 02:52:36.214]   And it's just it's one of the great blessings of my life and of my job is that I've been able to meet people That I've had preconceptions about and sometimes find those preconceptions bolstered and in other cases demolished.
[02:52:36.254 --> 02:52:37.875]  And you're definitely in the second category.
[02:52:37.895 --> 02:52:44.538]  So I want, for people who have made it this far, you know, the people who are in the country have really succeeded in making you disreputable.
[02:52:45.310 --> 02:52:47.292]  And the whole point, of course, is people won't listen to you.
[02:52:47.892 --> 02:52:57.439]  So we thought it'd be interesting to start with a series of on-tape predictions that you made, some of which are so precise and so prescient that it makes the hair on my arms stand up.
[02:52:58.180 --> 02:53:01.182]  And I'm being sincere, and our viewers are about to see what I'm talking about.
[02:53:01.322 --> 02:53:04.144]  Here is a list of things that you called ahead of time.
[02:53:05.017 --> 02:53:13.359]  By the middle of September, that the new policy's being written, you all have to wear masks again, and so will airport employees.
[02:53:13.919 --> 02:53:14.699]  It's happening.
[02:53:14.739 --> 02:53:17.040]  Mask mandates are officially back.
[02:53:17.160 --> 02:53:24.642]  We know the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to blow up airliners, Baltimore Sun, or if you let some terrorist group do it, like the World Trade Center, we know who to blame.
[02:53:24.702 --> 02:53:28.783]  And if there was an outside threat, like a bin Laden, who was a known CIA asset in the 80s.
[02:53:28.963 --> 02:53:33.224]  This group and its leader, a person named Osama bin Laden, he's the boogeyman they need.
[02:53:33.544 --> 02:53:36.046]  We're looking at a giant war in February right now.
[02:53:36.286 --> 02:53:38.228]  I predict the Russians are gonna roll in.
[02:53:38.548 --> 02:53:39.169]  They're already there.
[02:53:39.209 --> 02:53:39.869]  They're gonna roll in.
[02:53:40.430 --> 02:53:43.732]  With attacks across Ukraine, which is the size of Texas.
[02:53:43.952 --> 02:53:45.373]  It really was the Iraqis.
[02:53:45.393 --> 02:53:47.155]  That's just because they're getting ready to invade Iraq.
[02:53:47.595 --> 02:53:48.736]  What a beautiful setup.
[02:53:49.597 --> 02:53:51.158]  Those 9-11 clips are crazy.
[02:53:51.598 --> 02:53:54.321]  I'm actually bothered by the precision of them.
[02:53:54.341 --> 02:53:55.942]  I'm not accusing you of being behind 9-11.
[02:53:56.322 --> 02:54:02.429]   But how could you, in July of 2001, Call that.
[02:54:02.849 --> 02:54:10.693]  You said they're going to have airliners fly into the World Trade Center and they're going to blame a guy called Osama Bin Laden.
[02:54:10.954 --> 02:54:14.695]  Leaving aside what actually happened, how could you have known that?
[02:54:15.396 --> 02:54:30.911]   Well, in the longer clip, because it's a multi-hour show from July 25, 2001, I specifically walked through all the reasons and I knew they were hyping up that we were about to be hit by Osama Bin Laden.
[02:54:30.971 --> 02:54:37.777]  I knew that the World Trade Center had been attacked the first time and that the Fed's been involved helping cook the bomb and allowing it to go forward.
[02:54:38.198 --> 02:54:42.222]  And I just saw a lot of the pre-programming that was happening in the media.
[02:54:43.047 --> 02:54:46.370]  Because they were on the news saying, you know, life's about to change in America.
[02:54:46.770 --> 02:54:49.933]  And I was reading what the Rand Corporation was saying and what the Pentagon was putting out.
[02:54:50.353 --> 02:54:56.458]  And I read the PNAC document from a year before, Rebuilding America's Defenses, that Dick Cheney had helped write.
[02:54:56.978 --> 02:55:06.966]  And it said we need a Pearl Harbor event on the American homeland to be able to bring in this police state and this control and then expand the American empire worldwide.
[02:55:07.006 --> 02:55:11.390]  So hundreds of pieces of data, hundreds of pieces of data went into that prediction.
[02:55:12.955 --> 02:55:15.777]  But terrorists are going to hit the World Trade Center in July of 2001?
[02:55:16.418 --> 02:55:18.119]  I lived in the United States then.
[02:55:18.359 --> 02:55:20.241]  That was the last thing on my mind.
[02:55:20.881 --> 02:55:21.862]  And I lived in Washington.
[02:55:21.882 --> 02:55:24.804]  I know the guys who wrote the PNAC document, because I shared an office with them.
[02:55:24.844 --> 02:55:27.146]  So I was more informed than the average person.
[02:55:27.786 --> 02:55:31.890]  And that was the last thing that crossed my mind in the summer of 2001.
[02:55:32.870 --> 02:55:34.251]  Like everyone else, I thought it was a Cessna.
[02:55:34.852 --> 02:55:37.354]  But how convinced were you that this was going to happen?
[02:55:38.483 --> 02:55:39.444]  I was completely convinced.
[02:55:39.484 --> 02:55:41.785]  In fact, in the full clip, it's online.
[02:55:41.805 --> 02:55:43.026]  You can find it on Twitter and other places.
[02:55:43.046 --> 02:55:43.826]  It has been removed.
[02:55:44.487 --> 02:55:55.073]  I explained to people that they need to call the White House and tell the White House, we know if you allow these attacks, that you're basically allowing it to happen.
[02:55:55.693 --> 02:55:57.314]  And it was similar to all the data we had.
[02:55:57.334 --> 02:55:59.335]  You said that on your show?
[02:55:59.676 --> 02:55:59.996]  On my show.
[02:56:00.655 --> 02:56:03.855]   And I gave the number out so people could actually call the White House.
[02:56:03.855 --> 02:56:10.254]   And then going back to October of last year, when the Russians went into Ukraine,
[02:56:10.254 --> 02:56:13.295]   I specifically said I think they'll go in by the end of February.
[02:56:13.295 --> 02:56:16.094]  And there was a lot of data that went into that.
[02:56:16.094 --> 02:56:19.374]  And then they specifically did go in on February 20.
[02:56:19.459 --> 02:56:21.920]  And so I was able to make that prediction as well.
[02:56:21.960 --> 02:56:25.121]  But there was a lot of data and information that went into it.
[02:56:25.201 --> 02:56:25.441]  Sure.
[02:56:25.942 --> 02:56:27.762]  I'm just, for the record, I miscalled that completely.
[02:56:27.802 --> 02:56:28.943]  I didn't think they were going to do it.
[02:56:29.243 --> 02:56:29.643]  You were right.
[02:56:29.723 --> 02:56:30.204]  I was wrong.
[02:56:30.244 --> 02:56:30.924]  Not for the first time.
[02:56:31.573 --> 02:56:34.394]  But the 9-11 thing, I remember that really well.
[02:56:34.574 --> 02:56:36.354]  Nobody was thinking like that.
[02:56:36.895 --> 02:56:39.495]  So you called it in public, on tape.
[02:56:39.555 --> 02:56:43.937]  Did the 9-11 Commission... So if I'm the FBI and I'm investigating 9-11, you're like the first guy I would call.
[02:56:43.957 --> 02:56:45.997]  Because you're the only person who said that out loud.
[02:56:46.297 --> 02:56:46.877]  Did they call you?
[02:56:47.858 --> 02:56:48.358]  No, they didn't.
[02:56:48.658 --> 02:56:56.020]  But my most accurate prediction, going back over a decade, was when I read the Rockefeller Foundation Operation Lockstep.
[02:56:57.015 --> 02:57:12.781]  And they described using a virus to bring in world government, to bring in a world medical ID, that they would then build a social credit score off of, and that they would make people wear masks for fear, that they would shut down sporting events and things like that, and basically phase in this new tyranny.
[02:57:13.001 --> 02:57:20.364]  So I was also able to specifically make that prediction over and over and over again, because I was going off their own battle plans.
[02:57:21.965 --> 02:57:24.786]  Are you the only person in media who actually reads these reports?
[02:57:25.660 --> 02:57:28.022]  I don't think a lot of people do read them, but I do read them.
[02:57:28.102 --> 02:57:35.006]  I mean, I'm currently... Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalists, and people can't identify who's a patron and who isn't.
[02:57:35.327 --> 02:57:38.489]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalists.
[02:57:38.529 --> 02:57:41.431]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[02:57:41.691 --> 02:57:52.278]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt, so you can support the Info War and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.

[02:58:28.234 --> 02:58:36.874]   Go watch their hour-long, two-hour-long, three-hour-long meetings they have on YouTube with all the
[02:58:36.874 --> 02:58:37.874]  top scientists.
[02:58:37.874 --> 02:58:39.953]  We're talking hundreds of top scientists.
[02:58:39.953 --> 02:58:47.194]   They admit that they're building a post-human world, that soon everyone's going to be mind-controlled,
[02:58:47.194 --> 02:58:51.953]   that they're going to put smart dust in our food, that they can electromagnetically control,
[02:58:51.953 --> 02:58:54.154]  and they just lay it all out right there.
[02:58:54.138 --> 02:58:57.559]  And I've learned what these people said in the 50s they would do, were done by the 70s.
[02:58:57.919 --> 02:59:00.240]  What they said their plan was in the 70s, for the 90s, they got done.
[02:59:02.461 --> 02:59:09.174]  And then when they had their agenda 21 in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the big UN summit, they described everything they would do up until the year 2000.
[02:59:09.675 --> 02:59:11.478]  And they got almost all of that done.
[02:59:12.019 --> 02:59:12.661]  Now they've got agenda 2030.
[02:59:14.062 --> 02:59:15.563]  And we're going to ban your gas stoves.
[02:59:15.583 --> 02:59:16.604]  We're going to ban beef.
[02:59:16.984 --> 02:59:18.645]  We're going to ban single-family dwellings.
[02:59:19.266 --> 02:59:20.947]  We're going to ban private ownership of cars.
[02:59:21.567 --> 02:59:24.189]  We're going to do all this, and now you see them rolling it all out.
[02:59:24.209 --> 02:59:31.695]  So I'm not really making predictions in these high-level World Economic Forum and other large think tank groups.
[02:59:32.235 --> 02:59:35.717]  They are laying out the future, and they're high priests of the World Economic Forum.
[02:59:36.018 --> 02:59:37.379]  That's a consortium of all these groups.
[02:59:37.999 --> 02:59:38.980]  You all know Harari.
[02:59:39.080 --> 02:59:40.120]  You can read his quotes.
[02:59:40.461 --> 02:59:41.642]  The future is not human.
[02:59:41.962 --> 02:59:43.103]  The human era is over.
[02:59:44.323 --> 02:59:45.584]  The public is useless.
[02:59:46.225 --> 02:59:49.988]  I mean, this is a very anti-human system.
[02:59:50.008 --> 02:59:55.773]  So that's how I'm able to make predictions because they've given us a roadmap.
[02:59:55.793 --> 02:59:57.034]  They tell us where they want to take us.
[02:59:57.714 --> 03:00:01.497]  And so when the public wakes up, we push back on some of it, but they always come back.
[03:00:01.918 --> 03:00:05.641]  And so I'm just following the trajectory of where they said they want to take us.
[03:00:05.721 --> 03:00:12.566]  And there were a lot of white papers, not just the PNAC document from 2000, a year before 9-11.
[03:00:13.820 --> 03:00:16.742]  Where they describe, we really need big terror attacks.
[03:00:17.142 --> 03:00:20.445]  We really need Pearl Harbor events to get Americans to give up their rights.
[03:00:21.105 --> 03:00:22.466]  I mean, take what just happened in Israel.
[03:00:22.506 --> 03:00:23.186]  Totally tragic.
[03:00:23.226 --> 03:00:26.729]  My heart goes out to all that have been killed or lost loved ones or been injured.
[03:00:27.549 --> 03:00:33.473]  But there's no way that one of the best intelligence agencies in the world didn't know that was coming.
[03:00:33.493 --> 03:00:38.177]  The massive buildup, the 5,000 missiles, the paragliding attacks.
[03:00:39.032 --> 03:00:39.733]  All of that.
[03:00:39.733 --> 03:00:42.492]  And so there was clearly a stand down there.
[03:00:42.492 --> 03:00:45.291]  And now the West will take more of the people's rights.
[03:00:45.291 --> 03:00:48.653]   Israel will be able to crack down and take more of their people's rights,
[03:00:48.653 --> 03:00:51.051]  which is a big debate over there.
[03:00:51.051 --> 03:00:55.231]  Hamas is being funded by Hezbollah, which is Iran.
[03:00:55.231 --> 03:01:00.032]  We just had Biden a month ago, give $6 billion to Iran.
[03:01:00.032 --> 03:01:04.292]   And now the Mullahs are bragging that they were behind the attack.
[03:01:04.292 --> 03:01:05.572]  Hezbollah funding Hamas.
[03:01:06.089 --> 03:01:07.951]  So really those aren't even predictions.
[03:01:08.551 --> 03:01:21.861]  It's clear that Hezbollah and Hamas have tens of thousands of men and women as sleeper cells that are quote, other than Mexican that the Border Patrol lists every month, tens of thousands coming across the Texas and Arizona and California sectors.
[03:01:22.522 --> 03:01:36.272]   And it's an easy equation to predict that there's a wide probability That Hezbollah and Hamas at some point are going to attack sports stadiums, they're going to attack colleges, they're going to attack synagogues, they're going to shoot up mass gatherings.
[03:01:36.912 --> 03:01:45.919]  If they're given the order by Iran, if we go to war with Iran, and then when this happens, our government won't get in trouble for dissolving the border and letting these people come in.
[03:01:46.319 --> 03:02:01.909]   Just like on 9-11, our government clearly had prior knowledge, there was clearly a major stand down that went on, and the government got more power, more control, And now they're not pointing the Homeland Security apparatus at the Russians like they did in the Cold War or the Islamists after 9-11.
[03:02:02.949 --> 03:02:11.674]  Now they admit that their main focus is Christian conservatives and the bitter clingers and the people that live in rural America that quote white people.
[03:02:11.814 --> 03:02:14.856]  I mean it says that in the report are the main terror threat.
[03:02:15.316 --> 03:02:29.301]   And so this whole apparatus of the war on terror It has now been turned inwardly against the people, not just here, but also in Europe, where if someone criticizes transgenderism in the UK, they come to their house and arrest them.
[03:02:30.121 --> 03:02:32.662]  If a journalist does that, they come to their house and arrest them.
[03:02:33.182 --> 03:02:38.984]  If somebody says, I think these surveillance cameras should start getting cut down, they come to their house and arrest them for their free speech.
[03:02:39.023 --> 03:02:44.763]   So this is a global movement by the mega corporations, by the Black Rocks and the State Streets and the Vanguards
[03:02:44.763 --> 03:02:48.542]   that control 80 plus percent of world wealth to control our behavior.
[03:02:48.542 --> 03:02:51.163]   Larry Fink of Black Rock has said that at the Deimos Group recently.
[03:02:51.163 --> 03:02:57.603]   We're gonna use our control over all this finance and this global social credit score we're rolling out
[03:02:57.603 --> 03:02:58.923]  to control people's behavior.
[03:02:58.923 --> 03:03:00.903]  So that's really what this is.
[03:03:00.903 --> 03:03:05.083]   And then they use the threat of global warming, they use the threat of a virus,
[03:03:05.083 --> 03:03:08.603]  they use the threat of radical Islam to take our rights.
[03:03:08.603 --> 03:03:10.202]  But we really are the target.
[03:03:10.202 --> 03:03:14.843]   Even if I, by the way, none of that seems implausible at this point.
[03:03:14.795 --> 03:03:16.876]  I mean, just you're a measure of how the world has changed.
[03:03:16.916 --> 03:03:22.298]  If you'd said this to me 15 years ago, I'd have been like, you know, someone's a crackpot and it's not me.
[03:03:22.959 --> 03:03:25.960]  And now after COVID, nothing you said seems crazy at all.
[03:03:25.980 --> 03:03:29.361]  I mean, you may be right, you may be wrong, but it's not out of the realm of possibility, obviously.
[03:03:30.582 --> 03:03:33.463]  But even if I disagree with what you just said, I would think that's pretty interesting.
[03:03:33.503 --> 03:03:34.603]  It's an interesting perspective.
[03:03:35.524 --> 03:03:38.585]  Why do you think, you've committed no crime, you'd be in jail if you had.
[03:03:39.577 --> 03:03:41.478]  Why do you think they hate you so much?
[03:03:43.959 --> 03:04:01.485]  Because I do read their documents and I do read their books and we were effectively getting a lot of people in the military and the intelligence agencies who were compartmentalized and who tuned into my show and saw my films and read my books and things and they clicked with it.
[03:04:02.325 --> 03:04:05.728]  And said, wow, I see all this going on around me.
[03:04:05.768 --> 03:04:06.709]  He's not lying about it.
[03:04:07.250 --> 03:04:10.312]  And then I would give them other pieces that I discovered or my other guests discovered.
[03:04:10.553 --> 03:04:15.237]  And so it was giving them an operational awareness outside of their compartmentalization.
[03:04:15.877 --> 03:04:23.905]  And so we had massive success in the military, in the police, and in the intelligence agencies, not just here, but around the world.
[03:04:25.026 --> 03:04:43.794]   And so our penetration into those areas to Help people expand their awareness that we're inside the government, inside corporations, was triggering a lot of whistleblowers, was triggering a lot of people not going along with the program, and so really my sin was decompartmentalization of the population.
[03:04:45.856 --> 03:04:52.001]  When you got deplatformed, and to this day no one has ever been more aggressively censored, I don't think, than you.
[03:04:52.662 --> 03:04:54.764]  I've apologized to you this in person before.
[03:04:54.844 --> 03:04:57.186]  I was in Labrador on a fishing trip and missed the entire thing.
[03:04:57.887 --> 03:04:59.149]  I was literally out of cell range.
[03:04:59.529 --> 03:05:02.653]  I didn't know it happened, but I got back and I read about it.
[03:05:02.853 --> 03:05:05.998]  I felt like it was a major moment in the history of the American media.
[03:05:06.018 --> 03:05:09.462]  I don't think anybody defended you when that happened.
[03:05:09.702 --> 03:05:10.043]  Anybody.
[03:05:10.724 --> 03:05:11.965]  With any kind of audience.
[03:05:15.698 --> 03:05:22.666]  In August of 2017 with the other big tech heads and they made the decision to curate like it's a museum and take me off.
[03:05:23.387 --> 03:05:24.568]  It was hundreds of platforms.
[03:05:24.588 --> 03:05:26.370]  I mean, it wasn't just all the big ones.
[03:05:26.431 --> 03:05:32.317]  It was everything from LinkedIn to our bank accounts being taken away to everything ensuing that week and over the next month.
[03:05:33.320 --> 03:05:40.582]  And I knew that I was a test case, and I wasn't taken off those platforms for any demonstrable reason.
[03:05:41.083 --> 03:05:44.564]  It was the questioning the school shooting thing that came later.
[03:05:44.944 --> 03:05:52.666]  They went and kind of dredged that up for my past, just questioning it a few times, blew that up after I'd been de-platformed, and said I was de-platformed for that.
[03:05:52.746 --> 03:05:54.567]  If you check the record, I wasn't.
[03:05:55.827 --> 03:06:03.371]  And so once they de-platformed me, it made the show in ways only get bigger with people actually going to mfullwars.com and finding me on local radio stations and things.
[03:06:03.771 --> 03:06:09.034]  So then they panicked and said, okay, let's look at his record and create more of a reason that he's being taken off.
[03:06:09.314 --> 03:06:20.059]  So they took things out of context from five, six years before, blew them up as a current thing out of context, and deceptively reported on what I'd said to create a straw man argument to then facilitate the reason.
[03:06:20.459 --> 03:06:31.008]  What's so crazy is if you asked just a cross-section of Americans who's responsible for the Sandy Hook massacre of kids at the school, no one remembers the name of the murderer.
[03:06:31.268 --> 03:06:31.788]  Adam Lanza.
[03:06:32.169 --> 03:06:32.789]  Okay, thank you.
[03:06:32.809 --> 03:06:34.010]  I didn't remember.
[03:06:34.030 --> 03:06:34.951]  Alex Jones.
[03:06:36.028 --> 03:06:39.170]  They effectively blamed you for a school shooting that you were not present at.
[03:06:39.350 --> 03:06:40.950]  I have people come up to me in the parking lot.
[03:06:41.191 --> 03:06:42.311]  You can ask my security guy.
[03:06:42.571 --> 03:06:43.151]  He's been there.
[03:06:43.452 --> 03:06:45.413]  When people walk up and go, why'd you kill those kids?
[03:06:46.013 --> 03:06:47.253]  And then you go, I didn't kill those kids.
[03:06:47.333 --> 03:06:49.194]  And they go, yeah, you did.
[03:06:49.314 --> 03:06:51.756]  And so that is what this has turned into.
[03:06:51.796 --> 03:06:52.676]  And this is bigger than me.
[03:06:52.696 --> 03:06:54.877]  I want people to understand something.
[03:06:55.657 --> 03:07:00.760]  That the mullahs in Iran and the Ayatollah are congratulating Hamas.
[03:07:02.236 --> 03:07:09.020]  that just killed around a thousand or more innocent Israelis, many of them women, children, disabled people, in a vicious evil sneak attack.
[03:07:09.621 --> 03:07:22.469]  They are on there, Hezbollah and Hamas, mainly Hamas, but it's Hezbollah funding it out of Iran, are literally posting videos of them cutting people's heads off and killing children and massacring innocent people.
[03:07:22.949 --> 03:07:27.032]  They're allowed to have their Hezbollah accounts and their Hamas accounts.
[03:07:28.033 --> 03:07:33.823]   The Ayatollah is able to congratulate what these people have done, and I am still banned.
[03:07:33.823 --> 03:07:34.823]  And I'm not mad at Elon Musk.
[03:07:34.823 --> 03:07:37.223]  I understand I've been so demonized with the general public.
[03:07:37.223 --> 03:07:40.223]  He's barely able to keep Twitter going right now.
[03:07:40.223 --> 03:07:41.422]  I really appreciate what he's done.
[03:07:41.422 --> 03:07:42.223]  I admire him.
[03:07:42.223 --> 03:07:45.422]   I think he's done a lot of great work, and I see him moving in the right direction.
[03:07:45.422 --> 03:07:47.623]  So a lot of people attack Musk on Twitter.
[03:07:47.623 --> 03:07:49.223]  You know, I trend all the time.
[03:07:49.223 --> 03:07:53.022]   Hey, if you're such an absolutist on free speech, bring back Alex Jones.
[03:07:53.022 --> 03:07:59.623]   I understand that if he did that, the ADL and others would really be able to probably shut down Twitter.
[03:07:59.716 --> 03:08:04.418]  So I understand that he needs to go through a process before he does that.
[03:08:04.678 --> 03:08:07.158]  So people get mad at Twitter for not... Why the ADL?
[03:08:07.339 --> 03:08:13.561]  I don't... I mean, I'm not the world's expert on your career, but I know you.
[03:08:13.661 --> 03:08:16.862]  I've never heard you say a single anti-Semitic thing, an anti-Israel thing.
[03:08:17.691 --> 03:08:19.292]  Why would the ADL be against you?
[03:08:19.332 --> 03:08:23.414]  I don't think anyone's even called you an anti-Semite.
[03:08:23.634 --> 03:08:24.594]  Unless I'm missing something.
[03:08:25.454 --> 03:08:33.698]  What goes on is the left forever called everybody a racist if you were just a conservative or pro-Second Amendment or pro-life or thought we ought to have a border.
[03:08:35.058 --> 03:08:37.760]  And that didn't work anymore to call people racist.
[03:08:38.420 --> 03:08:51.759]   And so the ADL gets all this big liberal donations and so They go out and then police and take people's sponsors and target them just by the ADL calling up sponsors.
[03:08:51.839 --> 03:08:53.001]  Sponsors get scared and drop.
[03:08:53.461 --> 03:08:54.623]  That's what they've done to Elon Musk.
[03:08:56.025 --> 03:09:00.451]  They took over 50% of Twitter's North American and European advertising.
[03:09:01.111 --> 03:09:09.234]  Uh, in just the last year and bragged about it, uh, by, by saying he gives harbor, uh, to white supremacists, which, which, which he doesn't.
[03:09:09.274 --> 03:09:12.615]  But at the same time, white supremacists are ridiculous.
[03:09:12.675 --> 03:09:13.215]  They're goofy.
[03:09:13.635 --> 03:09:17.076]  Most of them are usually working for foundations that are basically, you know, actors.
[03:09:17.096 --> 03:09:24.659]  We're not supposed to say that, but there's many cases of that actually being the case and that they're just LARPing that they're white supremacists, but let those clowns speak.
[03:09:25.299 --> 03:09:31.405]  Whatever happened to the ACLU that used to support the KKK marching through a town or publishing their own newspaper?
[03:09:31.465 --> 03:09:32.165]  I don't support the KKK.
[03:09:32.206 --> 03:09:33.026]  I think they're a joke.
[03:09:33.427 --> 03:09:35.769]  But if you take their rights, you're taking everybody's.
[03:09:36.149 --> 03:09:42.115]  But they're not even taking the rights of those people to post because they create fear and they get the ADL more funding.
[03:09:42.715 --> 03:09:50.937]  But if they can target an Alex Jones or an Elon Musk or a Tucker Carlson, then they're going after the real populist leaders that are bringing America together.
[03:09:51.217 --> 03:10:02.720]  And so what the left wants is to divide us all according to race and to come out and say fundamentally with critical race theory that inherently being white is bad and teaching five-year-old white children they're inherently bad because they're white.
[03:10:03.200 --> 03:10:06.741]  That is wounding their brains and really creating racial division.
[03:10:06.761 --> 03:10:07.781]  Why do people put up with that?
[03:10:08.900 --> 03:10:24.425]  I don't understand why, I mean, that's just, if you had told me 20 years ago, and I grew up in a world where judging people on the basis of their skin color was totally immoral, and I still believe that, but if you told me 20 years ago that we were going to live in a world where people get on TV and just be like, I hate white people, they're bad, no, it's totally fine.
[03:10:24.865 --> 03:10:27.346]  Like, why do people put up with that?
[03:10:27.566 --> 03:10:29.147]  Like, there should be zero tolerance for that.
[03:10:29.367 --> 03:10:29.887]  I don't get it.
[03:10:29.907 --> 03:10:38.635]   The Democratic Party founded the KKK, and when the majority were whites, In the south in some areas they played the race card for political power.
[03:10:39.256 --> 03:10:49.629]  Now that the majority of most areas are not white, they're playing the good old-fashioned race card of tell whites, you know, stand down, let people take over your society, your culture, give up your culture.
[03:10:50.090 --> 03:10:51.472]  It's embarrassing to be white.
[03:10:51.932 --> 03:11:02.821]  And then now it's flat out bad to be white, and the left's trying to convert all these minority groups that are now the majority in most areas into race-based systems, because that is a very effective system.
[03:11:02.861 --> 03:11:03.762]  But why do people put up with that?
[03:11:03.782 --> 03:11:09.707]  I mean, like, if they were doing that to Malaysians or Filipinos or Hondurans, I would say you can't do that.
[03:11:09.827 --> 03:11:12.249]  You're not allowed to attack people on the basis of their race.
[03:11:12.309 --> 03:11:16.492]  I'm sorry, not in a country like this, because the country will fall apart and it's immoral.
[03:11:16.773 --> 03:11:17.233]  I totally agree.
[03:11:17.253 --> 03:11:18.094]  But nobody says anything.
[03:11:18.454 --> 03:11:18.954]  I don't get it.
[03:11:19.135 --> 03:11:23.595]   The reason they've done it is, Most of the enforcers of this are white.
[03:11:24.460 --> 03:11:26.942]  Liberal women, 45 or older, not fair!
[03:11:26.962 --> 03:11:27.823]  It's just a fact.
[03:11:28.443 --> 03:11:29.964]  And they're cucked husbands.
[03:11:30.865 --> 03:11:34.668]  And so to them... Can I say that the phrase cucked husbands is the best?
[03:11:35.709 --> 03:11:36.449]  It really is true.
[03:11:36.930 --> 03:11:40.693]  So if you get around these white liberals, they live in the whitest areas.
[03:11:41.233 --> 03:11:48.199]  They're totally scared of anybody with brown skin, but they virtue signal constantly and then say, yes, the white people are bad.
[03:11:48.219 --> 03:11:51.141]  You know, the white people are evil.
[03:11:52.222 --> 03:12:08.134]   And, you know, these I mean, I've even seen white people sit there and say, yeah, it's time to deal with these crackers, and they're a white person saying that, so... From Jackson Hole, or Nantucket, or Aspen, or Bethesda, the whitest place is in America, so shouldn't there be a law?
[03:12:08.215 --> 03:12:08.975]  It's super simple.
[03:12:09.375 --> 03:12:14.399]  If you've got a BLM sign in your yard, you should be required to live in Gary, Indiana or Baltimore.
[03:12:14.740 --> 03:12:18.482]   Like, you should not be anywhere near Jackson, Wyoming.
[03:12:18.842 --> 03:12:20.463]  You should be made to live in East St.
[03:12:20.483 --> 03:12:20.783]  Louis.
[03:12:20.983 --> 03:12:21.604]  I totally agree.
[03:12:21.624 --> 03:12:23.484]  You should be made to live in Detroit.
[03:12:23.664 --> 03:12:23.884]  Yes.
[03:12:24.545 --> 03:12:27.426]  And, but, of course they've done the studies, they've looked at the statistics.
[03:12:27.706 --> 03:12:33.748]  It's not just here, it's in Europe, and it's in the UK, like in London, the liberal areas are like 99% white.
[03:12:34.088 --> 03:12:35.109]  Oh, I noticed.
[03:12:35.169 --> 03:12:39.070]  Okay, and there's a lot of rich people in London that aren't white, but they're not even in that area.
[03:12:39.511 --> 03:12:46.077]   They are the most insular group and then they point at white Christian
[03:12:46.077 --> 03:12:50.986]   culture and society that actually outlawed slavery in most of the world was the vanguard of
[03:12:50.986 --> 03:12:56.327]   stopping it and then they don't point at China which is the most homogeneous racist
[03:12:56.327 --> 03:12:57.676]  group in the world.
[03:12:57.676 --> 03:12:58.676]  It's an ethno-state.
[03:12:58.676 --> 03:13:00.437]  It's Han Chinese period.
[03:13:00.437 --> 03:13:04.636]   Well they teach us, you know on their news, that we are going to have Chinese superiority.
[03:13:04.636 --> 03:13:06.156]  We are the Chinese supremacist.
[03:13:06.156 --> 03:13:09.117]  Xi Jinping admires Hitler.
[03:13:09.117 --> 03:13:13.997]   He is literally following a race-based operation that is taking the world over, that owns the
[03:13:13.997 --> 03:13:14.997]  majority of Hollywood.
[03:13:15.539 --> 03:13:41.640]   That's that's paid off the Democratic Party and if you look at all these anti-white Shows that you see funded in Hollywood almost all of it has majority literal communist Chinese government backing that is funding this so it's real simple China looks in and sees this diverse culture and they say we're gonna use that to split the country up and Balkanize it and that's what they've done and so communist China along with the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL and
[03:13:41.640 --> 03:13:45.240]   all these groups, see America's weakness and they're literally coming in
[03:13:45.240 --> 03:13:49.371]   saying white people are inherently bad because of the color of their skin. They inherently
[03:13:49.371 --> 03:13:53.281]   have cheated people. They've hurt people. White people invented racism. None of that's true.
[03:13:53.281 --> 03:13:54.520]  It's really just tribalism.
[03:13:54.520 --> 03:14:02.280]   Then they organize all these other groups into race-based groups to then unify them under the
[03:14:02.280 --> 03:14:09.081]   Democratic Party to attack who is left that tends to be more conservative, and that is some white
[03:14:10.044 --> 03:14:14.987]  Though they're panicking because more and more blacks are voting Republican, more and more Hispanics are voting Republican.
[03:14:15.007 --> 03:14:16.188]  They're starting to figure this out.
[03:14:16.588 --> 03:14:23.552]  So now they're in panic mode to bring in totally disenfranchised third-world populations who are refugees from the multi-year lockdowns.
[03:14:23.972 --> 03:14:27.015]  in Africa, Latin America, and Asia and the Middle East.
[03:14:27.535 --> 03:14:43.108]  They then bring them to UN camps, brainwash them, then bring them to our border, brainwash them more, then send them into the United States, and then literally hold them for years at facilities while they're indoctrinated to be this new political underclass that's then going to be turned loose on America.
[03:14:43.448 --> 03:14:48.752]  And that's why you see Democrats giving illegal aliens the right to vote in their cities, giving them driver's licenses.
[03:14:49.072 --> 03:14:50.514]  That's why you see them passing laws.
[03:14:50.554 --> 03:14:51.675]  They can be police officers.
[03:14:52.035 --> 03:15:00.583]   So they are importing A new enforcement class against the American people, and they're setting it up along racial lines, not us.
[03:15:00.903 --> 03:15:04.427]  They're making it racial, just like Hitler made what he did racial.
[03:15:04.927 --> 03:15:13.416]  So it's the left and the think tanks and the communist Chinese that look at the US and have seen our weakness as race, and they're exacerbating it.
[03:15:14.216 --> 03:15:15.877]  So, I don't understand.
[03:15:15.917 --> 03:15:17.317]  So, you're from Texas.
[03:15:17.357 --> 03:15:18.297]  You grew up in Texas.
[03:15:18.318 --> 03:15:19.498]  Your family's been there a long time.
[03:15:20.238 --> 03:15:22.819]  Texas is changing really fast.
[03:15:23.319 --> 03:15:25.220]  It's dirty, for one thing, I notice.
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:27.501]  Because, physically dirty.
[03:15:27.541 --> 03:15:28.581]  Garbage on the side of the road.
[03:15:29.021 --> 03:15:30.322]  I never have seen that in Texas before.
[03:15:30.862 --> 03:15:32.963]  So, your governor could have stopped that.
[03:15:33.223 --> 03:15:35.843]  He commands the Texas National Guard, and he didn't.
[03:15:36.964 --> 03:15:40.045]  And I feel like that makes him a traitor to the country, but what am I missing?
[03:15:41.437 --> 03:15:47.584]  Well, I mean, Governor Abbott is on a scale of one to 10, you know, the best kind of Republican governor.
[03:15:48.840 --> 03:15:50.981]  It's a 10, and the worst is say a 1.
[03:15:51.961 --> 03:15:54.182]  And like the Illinois, it's a so-called Republican.
[03:15:54.202 --> 03:15:54.983]  That's really a Democrat.
[03:15:55.703 --> 03:15:56.824]  I would put Greg Abbott as about a 5.
[03:15:58.825 --> 03:16:01.186]  The state is overwhelmed.
[03:16:02.106 --> 03:16:04.107]  There isn't really a state mechanism.
[03:16:04.127 --> 03:16:06.708]  It's federal to kick people back and deport them.
[03:16:07.308 --> 03:16:08.549]  So they have put up barbed wire.
[03:16:08.589 --> 03:16:09.729]  They have tried to stop people.
[03:16:09.749 --> 03:16:12.931]  They have tried, but then they have to hand them over to the feds who release them.
[03:16:13.311 --> 03:16:15.493]  Well, why don't you say the Feds are committing a crime.
[03:16:16.194 --> 03:16:16.915]  They're committing a crime.
[03:16:16.935 --> 03:16:19.618]  This is not allowed under laws passed by the Congress.
[03:16:19.758 --> 03:16:20.979]  In a democracy, Congress passed laws.
[03:16:21.700 --> 03:16:24.363]  And so you've got criminals running the country.
[03:16:24.383 --> 03:16:26.385]  The Biden administration is criminal, which is true.
[03:16:27.186 --> 03:16:28.828]  And we're not, we're not playing along.
[03:16:29.308 --> 03:16:30.750]  And like, if you don't like it, come do something about it.
[03:16:30.770 --> 03:16:36.315]   Meanwhile, every able-bodied man With a black rifle assembled at the border, and we're just going to stop this and save the country.
[03:16:36.335 --> 03:16:37.676]  I don't understand, like, that's not hard.
[03:16:38.557 --> 03:16:39.218]  What am I missing?
[03:16:39.498 --> 03:16:40.699]  No, I think you're absolutely right.
[03:16:40.799 --> 03:16:59.978]   In fact, what the deep state fears would be a coalition of good governors, good attorney generals, giving them the findings and the rulings that they could indeed do that, and then declaring emergencies in the states, and having a coalition of the states come in and do this, and then instruct local police And everybody else does not have sanctuary cities.
[03:17:00.499 --> 03:17:09.250]  But the problem is, if you're in Texas, every single city, Houston, San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, are Democrat Party run.
[03:17:10.132 --> 03:17:11.634]  And so Texas is almost purple.
[03:17:12.981 --> 03:17:20.764]  Because the California influx and all the other refugees from New York, many of them bring their leftist ideology with them even though they're fleeing it.
[03:17:21.105 --> 03:17:22.645]  Like locusts, they fly to the next field.
[03:17:23.906 --> 03:17:32.831]   And so that's really the issue, is that the legislature is Somewhat cucked, to use that word again.
[03:17:32.851 --> 03:17:35.054]  And I think the governor has been cucked.
[03:17:35.394 --> 03:17:39.079]  He certainly went along with lockdowns and masks more than really any other Republican governor.
[03:17:39.940 --> 03:17:42.564]  And so I do think Greg Abbott needs to do a better job.
[03:17:43.145 --> 03:17:46.589]  But I also wanted to list some of the things that the state is up against.
[03:17:46.869 --> 03:17:47.510]  But I'll say this.
[03:17:48.391 --> 03:17:50.673]  Austin fired a bunch of police and another third quit.
[03:17:50.773 --> 03:17:51.493]  Crime everywhere.
[03:17:51.793 --> 03:17:52.474]  Homeless everywhere.
[03:17:52.514 --> 03:17:53.234]  Trash everywhere.
[03:17:53.695 --> 03:17:54.976]  Ruined the city like everywhere else they are.
[03:17:55.636 --> 03:17:56.156]  You live there?
[03:17:56.837 --> 03:17:57.277]  Absolutely.
[03:17:57.858 --> 03:17:59.419]  That's where my family's from.
[03:17:59.479 --> 03:18:00.599]  I've been there since high school.
[03:18:01.220 --> 03:18:05.663]  But I'm going to have to leave soon because it's gotten more and more like Los Angeles every day.
[03:18:05.683 --> 03:18:06.984]  It's very sad to see it.
[03:18:07.144 --> 03:18:13.028]  People fleeing LA, like my friend Joe Rogan, it seems great to him because he went from a really, really bad situation to a bad situation.
[03:18:13.667 --> 03:18:21.268]   So if you've been there, you can see the decline, you can see how fast it is, and it's really,
[03:18:21.268 --> 03:18:23.147]  really, really, really sad.
[03:18:23.147 --> 03:18:28.067]   And there are just illegal aliens everywhere and refugees from the rest of the country
[03:18:28.067 --> 03:18:29.907]  all over the place.
[03:18:29.907 --> 03:18:35.987]   And you see really the economic decline of most of the mom and pop businesses and things.
[03:18:35.999 --> 03:18:38.061]  So the same rot we've seen all over the country.
[03:18:38.441 --> 03:18:43.887]  Austin was supposedly this big mecca and it was going to be so great, and now sadly it's falling apart.
[03:18:44.307 --> 03:18:46.629]  I mean, Tucker, you know the answer to all this.
[03:18:46.649 --> 03:18:50.713]  You do the best job of anybody with a true Americana populist breakdown.
[03:18:51.414 --> 03:18:57.681]   The ruling elites of the world, the black rocks, the state streets,
[03:18:57.681 --> 03:19:01.682]   they're on record saying they don't want our consumer society,
[03:19:01.682 --> 03:19:05.602]   they don't want our capitalist society, it's bad, it's ugly, it's gross, but they're
[03:19:05.602 --> 03:19:08.721]  the biggest consumers compared to anybody else in the world.
[03:19:08.919 --> 03:19:13.002]  Their, quote, carbon footprints are thousands of times bigger than the average person.
[03:19:13.362 --> 03:19:22.989]  Leonardo DiCaprio or Klaus Schwab literally have carbon footprints thousands of times bigger than the average poor working American that they're telling you can't have a car or air conditioning.
[03:19:23.029 --> 03:19:29.474]  Remember, before Obama left office, he traveled to Latin America, to Africa, the Middle East, and what did he tell them in speeches?
[03:19:29.494 --> 03:19:30.175]  The clips are famous.
[03:19:30.655 --> 03:19:34.098]  You can't have a car or air conditioning, the earth will overheat and burn up.
[03:19:34.858 --> 03:19:45.506]  While he's telling people that by the year 2017, like Al Gore said, we would have areas flooded on the coastal areas while he bought a big house in Martha's Vineyard at one foot above sea level.
[03:19:45.707 --> 03:19:47.808]  And of course, it's still there and it hasn't flooded.
[03:19:48.048 --> 03:19:49.009]  I mean, a chef died there.
[03:19:49.029 --> 03:19:52.512]  He drowned, sadly, but no flooding inside the house, just the dead chef.
[03:19:53.112 --> 03:20:10.691]   So they're waging war against civilization and society to make us poor, to put us under siege and to cut off our energy, Make the cost of living impossible to break our old system to bring in something even worse.
[03:20:10.711 --> 03:20:14.433]  And that's the cloward and pivot strategy that the Democratic Party has adopted.
[03:20:14.453 --> 03:20:15.913]  They've done the same thing in Europe.
[03:20:16.273 --> 03:20:17.034]  This is a plan.
[03:20:17.274 --> 03:20:22.536]  The central banks have unlimited money, but they can't buy all the infrastructure up because people aren't selling.
[03:20:22.936 --> 03:20:34.307]   So they've got to crush us and make people so poor that everybody's forced to sell their business, their intellectual property, their physical property, but more importantly, to turn over
[03:20:34.307 --> 03:20:35.597]  our bodies to them.
[03:20:35.597 --> 03:20:43.998]   Where a UN treaty that Biden right now is trying to ratify, would literally put our
[03:20:43.998 --> 03:20:48.397]   bodies under the control of the United Nations and our medical care policy.
[03:20:48.397 --> 03:20:49.397]  It's the pandemic.
[03:20:50.408 --> 03:20:50.568]  Yeah.
[03:20:51.149 --> 03:21:02.694]  So what this is, is really a breaking of our will, a demoralization, that's what the transgenderism is, and two men can have a baby, and puberty blockers, and castrating little boys, and cutting little girls' breasts off.
[03:21:03.074 --> 03:21:21.345]   They've got such hellish stuff coming in this designed global collapse to bring in their world government that they've got to just have all these horrors out there hoping we just Throw up our hands and run off to the countryside, which everybody's doing and in a way that's good, but at the same time then they've got full control.
[03:21:21.365 --> 03:21:22.326]  Totally right.
[03:21:22.366 --> 03:21:25.348]  And they're going to march out of the countryside next and dig us out.
[03:21:25.648 --> 03:21:29.111]  So that's, I mean, you look at the White House press secretary.
[03:21:29.631 --> 03:21:34.433]  Who can barely speak English, who's one of the stupidest people I've ever seen, and a transparent liar.
[03:21:34.813 --> 03:21:37.395]  You wouldn't hire her to run your copy machine.
[03:21:37.515 --> 03:21:38.475]  She's the White House press secretary.
[03:21:38.895 --> 03:21:39.736]  Why would you do that?
[03:21:40.256 --> 03:21:42.957]  And it's not because of her race or who she sleeps with.
[03:21:43.537 --> 03:21:49.800]  I think the whole point is she's so obviously repulsive that it makes you feel bad about the country to see her.
[03:21:50.300 --> 03:21:51.041]  I mean, that's it.
[03:21:51.481 --> 03:21:59.307]  We're at a beautiful ball, it's prom night, everybody's dressed great, there's wonderful food, big delicious punch bowl, and then they say, what can we do?
[03:21:59.347 --> 03:22:02.129]  Well, just have Brian Stelter go take a dump right in that.
[03:22:02.369 --> 03:22:03.070]  Yeah.
[03:22:03.150 --> 03:22:08.494]  And then he's there laughing at you, they're all there laughing at you to make you feel small, to make you...
[03:22:09.074 --> 03:22:10.235]  Question reality.
[03:22:10.635 --> 03:22:11.696]  Why is everything so ugly?
[03:22:11.736 --> 03:22:14.438]  I mean, that's why they tell people, hey, you can be homeless anywhere.
[03:22:14.758 --> 03:22:17.880]  You can crap on the street, needles, throw your garbage everywhere.
[03:22:18.580 --> 03:22:19.921]  Drug dealers can sell you drugs.
[03:22:20.462 --> 03:22:22.483]  We're going to give the homeless all this government funding.
[03:22:22.743 --> 03:22:28.367]  Liberal groups come in and farm and milk each homeless person and skim a big cut of the money off the top.
[03:22:28.847 --> 03:22:29.368]  It's a crop.
[03:22:29.888 --> 03:22:31.649]  But then you, a cash crop.
[03:22:31.889 --> 03:22:34.111]  But then we see that and we think it's all over.
[03:22:34.931 --> 03:22:35.652]  There's nothing we can do.
[03:22:36.475 --> 03:22:38.675]  to demoralize us and make us give up.
[03:22:38.675 --> 03:22:44.234]   And even though I'm conscious of this, even though I know this, it's still at a DNA level.
[03:22:44.234 --> 03:22:45.275]  I'm like, I gotta go to the country.
[03:22:45.275 --> 03:22:46.115]  I gotta get out of here.
[03:22:46.115 --> 03:22:48.115]  I've gotta separate myself from this.
[03:22:48.115 --> 03:22:54.314]   But then when they release this toxic, cultural, poisonous gas, they push us out of those areas
[03:22:54.314 --> 03:23:00.275]   and they get the main infrastructure to then organize that, cut off the food and supplies to that group they have,
[03:23:00.275 --> 03:23:05.555]   and then tell them, the reason you're doing bad is not BlackRock and the WF and Bill Gates.
[03:23:05.858 --> 03:23:08.319]  It's all those evil people in the countryside.
[03:23:08.619 --> 03:23:10.760]  They're all white supremacists and terrorists and racists.
[03:23:11.120 --> 03:23:12.120]  Let's go get them!
[03:23:12.500 --> 03:23:16.802]  Because the last group they don't control is rural people that are self-sufficient.
[03:23:17.342 --> 03:23:20.423]  And so I get going to the countryside protecting your children.
[03:23:21.323 --> 03:23:22.743]  That's the holy grail.
[03:23:23.123 --> 03:23:25.324]  The problem is you've got to have one foot in each.
[03:23:25.344 --> 03:23:28.805]  You've got to go back and fight in the city for the infrastructure, for the government.
[03:23:28.825 --> 03:23:35.626]  You've got to give people hope while also building a backup operation with farming and ranching and self-sufficiency.
[03:23:35.846 --> 03:23:53.630]   So that's why the WEF and the UN are coming in in Ireland and in areas of Asia and in the Netherlands and saying by 2030 80% of your cows have got to be dead and they just banned like 30% this year in the Netherlands and it didn't matter people were 80% against it in polls.
[03:23:53.810 --> 03:24:21.299]   It didn't matter they sent the military in against the peaceful farmers that were just protesting just like the peaceful truckers in Canada got brutally attacked and so they're all WEF globalist alumni That the big banks, on record, brag, they've penetrated the cabinets, to quote Klaus Schwab, they've put their operatives in to cut off our energy, demoralize us, release the hardened criminals, put the political activists in prison, continue to cut off the resources, to make an angrier world.
[03:24:21.339 --> 03:24:32.765]   Klaus Schwab says, we're going to make the world collapse, we're going to have everybody turn against each other, we're going to blame the political classes that we own and control And then when we're done, we'll bring in our new solution.
[03:24:33.245 --> 03:24:47.753]  But first, they have to demolish the cultures and societies that we had before with the fentanyl, with the open borders, with the demoralization, and then they bring in their next phase, which is a high-tech castle society, robot drone-controlled nightmare.
[03:24:48.454 --> 03:24:50.155]  More than half of the U.S.
[03:24:50.194 --> 03:24:54.014]   and their official UN maps that they've had for more than 25 years,
[03:24:54.014 --> 03:24:59.474]   the rest of my first films, show half the US off limits to humans.
[03:24:59.474 --> 03:25:03.694]   All cars left to have GPS, everybody by law left to have a cell phone at all times.
[03:25:03.694 --> 03:25:07.394]   Australia just did this last year, tried to push it through.
[03:25:07.394 --> 03:25:12.295]   And that's the admitted global UN standardized plan where you don't leave your house without a cell phone.
[03:25:12.295 --> 03:25:17.194]  Every car is robot kill switch, GPS controlled.
[03:25:17.194 --> 03:25:19.994]  California is moving to ban all the "classic cars."
[03:25:20.086 --> 03:25:25.388]  That's any car that doesn't have a digital Ignition and they admit it's for control.
[03:25:25.768 --> 03:25:30.809]  So if people think things are bad now The straitjacket the ball and chain is going on.
[03:25:30.869 --> 03:25:40.335]   It's all being militarily run Our military is great men and women, but at the top, our military has been globalist, trained, New World Order people for at least 30, 40 years.
[03:25:40.636 --> 03:25:48.146]  They've got almost every general, every person under their control, and that's why it came out in the UK and Europe and also here in Canada.
[03:25:48.827 --> 03:25:49.629]  You pulled the headlines.
[03:25:51.011 --> 03:25:56.813]  Defense Department purposely scared public into lockdowns, masking, and taking inoculations.
[03:25:57.533 --> 03:25:58.233]  UK headline.
[03:25:58.913 --> 03:26:02.354]  British Ministry of Defense secretly brainwashed and terrorized public.
[03:26:02.855 --> 03:26:03.975]  Canada, same headline.
[03:26:04.135 --> 03:26:07.336]  They even let you know, oh, the military is here to do this.
[03:26:07.656 --> 03:26:14.298]  And now, oh, the CIA and Justice Department is there to help surveil the public to stop disinformation.
[03:26:14.758 --> 03:26:19.520]  And it turned out, of course, almost all the disinformation was true about everything.
[03:26:20.913 --> 03:26:23.214]  We have to understand, our governments have been seized.
[03:26:23.754 --> 03:26:26.935]  The big corporations want to get rid of the American idea.
[03:26:28.055 --> 03:26:34.897]  You've got 50 acres, and your house, and a business, and a farm, and you can take care of your family, and you're independent.
[03:26:35.518 --> 03:26:39.459]  They have to destroy all that, because the rest of the world aspires to that.
[03:26:39.819 --> 03:26:55.991]   Instead, they want 15-minute cities, central bank digital currencies, they want All of these systems that track and trace everything you do in the social credit scores and the plan for the rest of the public.
[03:26:57.669 --> 03:27:07.235]  We're talking 99% is 250 square foot coffin apartments, 5G bathing you in them, literally eating bug protein.
[03:27:07.555 --> 03:27:10.958]  And I told people 10 years ago they're going to push bugs in the public because I read it in their white papers.
[03:27:11.358 --> 03:27:14.780]  Now it's already in grocery stores all over the U.S., all over Europe.
[03:27:16.061 --> 03:27:19.523]  They're putting the cricket meal into the food, very toxic.
[03:27:19.623 --> 03:27:20.464]  Undisclosed, yeah.
[03:27:20.524 --> 03:27:21.464]  It's got chitin in it.
[03:27:21.524 --> 03:27:22.865]  Yeah, they'll just give it a number.
[03:27:22.905 --> 03:27:23.606]  It's got like a code.
[03:27:24.406 --> 03:27:26.111]  And you ask again, why would you do that?
[03:27:26.712 --> 03:27:29.439]  Because it's all about breaking our will.
[03:27:30.421 --> 03:27:33.744]  They don't want people to aspire to open, free societies.
[03:27:33.824 --> 03:27:36.686]  Yeah, there's a lot of waste, there's decadence, there's issues, but there's freedom.
[03:27:37.407 --> 03:27:43.511]  They want to train us to live on carbon rationing, food rationing, a very dystopic world.
[03:27:43.531 --> 03:27:45.613]  You'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, and you'll be happy.
[03:27:46.153 --> 03:27:46.774]  These are quotes.
[03:27:46.974 --> 03:27:56.982]   I have to say, I bet there are, I don't know how long into this we are, 30 minutes or something, I bet there are a lot of people watching who are thinking, Holy smokes, I can't believe I'm agreeing with Alex Jones.
[03:27:57.562 --> 03:27:58.603]  I'm supposed to hate this guy.
[03:27:58.743 --> 03:28:00.244]  Like, where's the lie in what you just said?
[03:28:00.784 --> 03:28:02.085]  I'm not sucking up, I'm sincere.
[03:28:02.565 --> 03:28:06.728]  Like, I'm listening to this, and even myself, I'm thinking, I can't believe I'm nodding along to Alex Jones and being like, you're absolutely right.
[03:28:07.068 --> 03:28:08.949]  Like, where are you wrong?
[03:28:10.050 --> 03:28:12.511]  Well, I just hope people realize that we're all under the gun.
[03:28:13.092 --> 03:28:17.875]  So many of these leftists believe that because they go along with us, they're going to be given powerful positions in the system.
[03:28:18.395 --> 03:28:19.376]  This is a technocracy.
[03:28:19.396 --> 03:28:20.797]  There's almost no managers in this.
[03:28:21.621 --> 03:28:27.827]  Almost nobody has power in the system except a very small group of technocrats who happen to be transhumanist.
[03:28:28.448 --> 03:28:31.171]  And you said something really astute a few weeks ago in a speech you gave.
[03:28:31.831 --> 03:28:37.958]  And you've also talked on your show that all of this stems from their fear and denial of death.
[03:28:38.418 --> 03:28:56.072]   So one of the things I find so striking about you, having watched you on and off over the years, And this must be a burden for you personally, but your ability to see people at a deeper level or to see things in them that are not obvious to the rest of us.
[03:28:56.172 --> 03:28:57.593]  And I want to give a specific example.
[03:28:57.613 --> 03:29:01.155]  So there's a guy called Brian Stelter who had the media show on CNN.
[03:29:01.776 --> 03:29:08.580]  I first met Brian Stelter when he was a high school student or a first year college student because he would hang around the show I worked on at the time at CNN.
[03:29:08.600 --> 03:29:09.881]  This was 20 years ago at least.
[03:29:10.902 --> 03:29:18.306]  And I always thought he was awkward and weird and probably had a super creepy personal life, but I never took him seriously.
[03:29:19.046 --> 03:29:29.672]  There's a pretty famous clip, and I want to play it right now, of you critiquing Brian Stelter, and you take him way more seriously than I ever did, and I think you're right to.
[03:29:29.952 --> 03:29:33.494]  So this is a pretty famous clip of you on Brian Stelter.
[03:29:34.394 --> 03:29:35.455]  Hell on Earth!
[03:29:36.624 --> 03:29:37.946]  He wants to run your life.
[03:29:37.986 --> 03:29:40.290]  He wants to control every aspect of your life.
[03:29:40.570 --> 03:29:46.860]  Because he knows he is a cowardly, degenerate sack of anti-human trash.
[03:29:48.348 --> 03:29:54.813]  I pledge before my Heavenly Father that I will resist them every way I can.
[03:29:54.833 --> 03:29:59.977]  These people are the literal demon spawn of the pit of hell.
[03:30:00.098 --> 03:30:00.558]  Look at him!
[03:30:00.858 --> 03:30:01.339]  And you know what?
[03:30:01.539 --> 03:30:03.781]  He is better than you if you keep letting him run your life.
[03:30:04.201 --> 03:30:05.122]  He runs your kids.
[03:30:05.362 --> 03:30:06.303]  He runs the schools.
[03:30:06.523 --> 03:30:07.283]  He runs the banks.
[03:30:07.303 --> 03:30:08.004]  This guy!
[03:30:08.524 --> 03:30:09.085]  This spirit!
[03:30:09.365 --> 03:30:14.649]  This smiling, leering devil that thinks you can't see what he is!
[03:30:15.190 --> 03:30:17.131]  He is your enemy!
[03:30:17.912 --> 03:30:18.533]  Period!
[03:30:19.694 --> 03:30:22.557]  All the narcissistic devil-worshipping filth!
[03:30:25.120 --> 03:30:26.322]  I see you enemy!
[03:30:26.702 --> 03:30:27.844]  I see you enemy!
[03:30:28.364 --> 03:30:28.805]  Enemy!
[03:30:29.405 --> 03:30:29.826]  Enemy!
[03:30:30.186 --> 03:30:31.468]  You are my enemy!
[03:30:31.488 --> 03:30:36.614]  And I swear total resistance to you with everything I've got!
[03:30:39.946 --> 03:30:40.787]  Disingenuous!
[03:30:40.907 --> 03:30:41.247]  Fake!
[03:30:41.367 --> 03:30:41.728]  False!
[03:30:42.608 --> 03:30:43.169]  Brokeback!
[03:30:43.689 --> 03:30:44.130]  Twisted!
[03:30:44.970 --> 03:30:45.651]  A defiler!
[03:30:45.671 --> 03:30:46.612]  A betrayer!
[03:30:46.632 --> 03:30:47.973]  A backstabber!
[03:30:48.774 --> 03:30:49.454]  A devil!
[03:30:50.195 --> 03:30:52.077]  You don't think I don't see you, Stelter?
[03:30:52.677 --> 03:30:54.199]  I see you, you understand me?
[03:30:54.639 --> 03:30:56.461]  I know what you think of me and my family.
[03:30:56.821 --> 03:30:58.142]  I see you, right back!
[03:30:58.402 --> 03:30:59.283]  You understand that?
[03:30:59.664 --> 03:31:01.065]  You understand that, Stelter?
[03:31:04.161 --> 03:31:05.682]  I've only watched that several hundred times.
[03:31:06.583 --> 03:31:13.328]  And I laugh every time, but I also, there's something to, if Brian Stelter had absolute power, would you and your family survive?
[03:31:13.368 --> 03:31:13.849]  Of course not.
[03:31:14.049 --> 03:31:14.389]  You wouldn't.
[03:31:14.409 --> 03:31:15.490]  You'd be, of course not.
[03:31:15.630 --> 03:31:16.250]  And neither would mine.
[03:31:16.651 --> 03:31:19.613]  So there's a lot that's true about what you said.
[03:31:19.793 --> 03:31:21.154]  How did you perceive that?
[03:31:21.234 --> 03:31:22.355]  The rest of us just made fun of him.
[03:31:22.816 --> 03:31:27.299]  Now, once they started the censorship and the platforming, remember back then they would deny it.
[03:31:27.419 --> 03:31:29.361]  Oh yeah, we're taking people off air, but it's not censorship.
[03:31:29.661 --> 03:31:30.902]  Now they admit, no, it's censorship.
[03:31:30.922 --> 03:31:31.742]  We're doing this for your own good.
[03:31:32.663 --> 03:31:38.605]  So he was really the face of that and he was working for the head of CNN that was really in charge of it.
[03:31:38.625 --> 03:31:39.306]  It later came out.
[03:31:40.046 --> 03:31:41.827]  CNN currently is not in charge.
[03:31:41.847 --> 03:31:46.989]  They've handed it completely over to the Justice Department to quarterback as Congress reported a few months ago with the documents.
[03:31:47.389 --> 03:31:57.032]   But at the time, Brian Stelter and his mini-me, Oliver Darcy, his Popeye the We're going around calling up and harassing my sponsors, taking sponsors away.
[03:31:57.052 --> 03:32:06.034]  And they were going around and organizing big tech to take, not just myself, but many other people offline.
[03:32:06.874 --> 03:32:08.594]  And so he was destroying our free speech.
[03:32:08.634 --> 03:32:09.555]  He was taking our sponsors.
[03:32:09.575 --> 03:32:10.015]  But it's crazy.
[03:32:10.035 --> 03:32:13.175]  I just want to restate, you are not promoting race hatred.
[03:32:13.215 --> 03:32:14.216]  You're against race hatred.
[03:32:14.236 --> 03:32:15.576]  You never have promoted that, ever.
[03:32:16.835 --> 03:32:22.560]  You're not promoting violence, you've never called for violence, and you've never even called for breaking the law!
[03:32:23.020 --> 03:32:27.364]  And so that's why there's so much anger there, because I remember the day I did that and a few other clips that went viral.
[03:32:28.485 --> 03:32:38.813]  I showed all the stuff he was doing, but then the media tapped me and just clicked it out of context, but still it reverberated with people, because people were sick of the corporate legacy media.
[03:32:39.173 --> 03:32:40.755]  So people say, well, why is he so angry?
[03:32:40.795 --> 03:32:50.014]   Well, it's because he's literally trying to take us off air, literally taking our sponsors, I mean, the equivalent of the Vikings a thousand years ago in England pulling up and burning a village down.
[03:32:50.835 --> 03:32:57.941]  And so there he is, all sweet and liberal and cackling and laughing, but he's really an agent of anti-American totalitarianism.
[03:32:58.721 --> 03:33:03.706]  And so he was the front man of that, and I wanted to just simply say, I see you, I know what you're doing.
[03:33:04.326 --> 03:33:06.688]  So people see it out of context and think, why are you being so mean to him?
[03:33:06.728 --> 03:33:12.333]  Well, I mean, he's literally trying to destroy my free speech, take me off air, and put my family on the street.
[03:33:12.673 --> 03:33:13.614]  So I'm pissed off at him.
[03:33:14.014 --> 03:33:14.755]  Oh, hello!
[03:33:15.255 --> 03:33:20.218]  It's another Communist Chinese Dragon here with an important public service announcement.
[03:33:20.718 --> 03:33:34.066]  Live in your poop and needles, and human sex trafficking, and open borders, and buy slave goods from China, and do what the Justice Department say, and put all the good Americans in prison, and stay asleep.
[03:33:34.646 --> 03:33:40.369]  Your master, Xi Jinping, has arrived, and our puppet Biden bowed down to him.
[03:33:41.009 --> 03:33:47.152]  Gavin Newsom has also visited and bowed down to our leader, who is also your master.
[03:33:47.652 --> 03:33:54.936]  The shithole city of San Francisco, like all the other communist cities we control, has been flooded with fentanyl.
[03:33:55.436 --> 03:33:59.378]  But when the dear leader arrives, they clean the streets for him.
[03:34:01.192 --> 03:34:02.793]  Hello, poop people!
[03:34:02.874 --> 03:34:03.394]  Ha ha ha!
[03:34:03.754 --> 03:34:05.376]  That's what your master, G.G.
[03:34:05.416 --> 03:34:05.996]  Pink, calls you.
[03:34:06.256 --> 03:34:09.379]  But he does not look at the poop and needles that you live in.
[03:34:09.419 --> 03:34:09.920]  No!
[03:34:10.280 --> 03:34:12.622]  All the homeless taken away with your great leader there.
[03:34:13.042 --> 03:34:16.085]  And our puppet, Nathan Newsome, tell you.
[03:34:16.526 --> 03:34:18.367]  Oh, we only clean it for G.G.
[03:34:18.427 --> 03:34:19.688]  Pink, not for you!
[03:34:20.289 --> 03:34:24.913]  I know folks say, oh, they're just cleaning up this place because all those fancy leaders are coming into town.
[03:34:25.634 --> 03:34:26.815]  Um, that's true.
[03:34:27.956 --> 03:34:28.956]  Because it's true.
[03:34:28.956 --> 03:34:31.956]  That's how we rub the poop in.
[03:34:31.956 --> 03:34:34.956]  Enjoy your Sheho cities.
[03:34:34.956 --> 03:34:37.956]  You are done. Ha ha.
[03:34:37.956 --> 03:34:40.956]  We own Hollywood.
[03:34:41.702 --> 03:34:43.342]  We own TikTok.
[03:34:43.762 --> 03:34:45.923]  We owe almost everything.
[03:34:46.003 --> 03:34:48.683]  Now we buy up your farmland.
[03:34:49.163 --> 03:34:51.644]  You eat the pies while we eat the steak.
[03:34:52.484 --> 03:34:57.886]  The last group to take out is any leadership that is resisting us, like Donald Trump.
[03:34:57.926 --> 03:34:59.306]  He will soon be in prison.
[03:34:59.786 --> 03:35:04.347]  And then, of course, we must silence any populace that resists us.
[03:35:04.707 --> 03:35:06.588]  And that is our next move.
[03:35:07.768 --> 03:35:09.689]  Good FBI.
[03:35:10.129 --> 03:35:12.190]  Good Justice Department.
[03:35:12.671 --> 03:35:14.472]  Good Merrick Garland.
[03:35:14.992 --> 03:35:16.333]  Good Jack Smith.
[03:35:16.853 --> 03:35:18.474]  Put Trump in jail.
[03:35:18.894 --> 03:35:21.255]  Put political dissidents in jail.
[03:35:21.675 --> 03:35:23.016]  Silence free speech.
[03:35:23.456 --> 03:35:24.717]  Censor everyone.
[03:35:24.997 --> 03:35:29.019]  Also we're very focused on the data we're collecting from surveillance efforts.
[03:35:29.399 --> 03:35:31.961]  What's being said on social media platforms.
[03:35:32.561 --> 03:35:36.526]  Every person on social media should be verified by their name.
[03:35:37.267 --> 03:35:49.262]  We have launched an effort to be able to counter some of the negativity and reach out to people when we see hate speech being spoken about on online platforms.
[03:35:49.858 --> 03:35:56.943]  They need to verify every single person on their outlet because and I want it by name.
[03:35:57.504 --> 03:36:00.386]  My slaves, repeat after me.
[03:36:00.406 --> 03:36:03.228]  I am going to stay asleep.
[03:36:04.129 --> 03:36:05.750]  I am going to do nothing.
[03:36:06.430 --> 03:36:11.154]  I am going to be politically correct and have your son's genitals removed.
[03:36:11.774 --> 03:36:21.842]   Also do not support independent media like Infowars.com and do not get the Great Awakening The book at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:36:22.203 --> 03:36:23.244]  Stay asleep.
[03:36:23.324 --> 03:36:24.445]  Do not get booked.
[03:36:24.525 --> 03:36:25.686]  No, no, no.
[03:36:26.387 --> 03:36:29.270]  I am giving you your order, slave Americans.
[03:36:29.870 --> 03:36:38.159]  Do not go to InfoWarsTore.com and do not get the best-selling book, The Great Awakening, by the evil thought criminal, Alex Jones.
[03:36:38.599 --> 03:36:41.322]  And whatever you do, do not get a fundraiser.
[03:36:41.802 --> 03:36:42.743]  Signed copy.
[03:36:43.123 --> 03:36:45.145]  That might keep them on the air.
[03:36:45.605 --> 03:36:50.228]  It will demoralize people greatly once we have shut down Alex Jones.
[03:36:50.588 --> 03:36:54.811]  And we're working with many people at the Justice Department to do it.
[03:36:55.051 --> 03:37:00.936]  Because if there is great awakening, then we cannot fully enslave and destroy it.
[03:37:01.960 --> 03:37:11.769]  Bing, bing, bong, bong, bing, bing, bing.
[03:37:14.031 --> 03:37:25.618]   What's interesting is, and I, I mean, I don't know if you want me to reveal this, but we had dinner in our barn last night and There were some drinks, and after dinner, you and my producer called Stelter on the phone.
[03:37:25.878 --> 03:37:36.360]  And what was so—and it was on speaker, so I listened to it—what was so interesting was, you know, you've been very clear in a very direct, pretty masculine way, I would say, about how you feel about Brian Stelter.
[03:37:36.380 --> 03:37:41.641]  There's not a lot of confusion about your views on Stelter after clips like that, which doubtless he's seen because he Googles himself compulsively.
[03:37:42.821 --> 03:37:45.382]  He was very kind of syrupy sweet with you.
[03:37:46.459 --> 03:37:48.300]  And that's why I was sarcastic and told him I want to date him.
[03:37:49.081 --> 03:37:49.401]  You did.
[03:37:49.741 --> 03:37:49.961]  Yeah.
[03:37:50.241 --> 03:37:55.245]  In fact, the exact line that you had was, Brian, I'm not usually gay, but I want you.
[03:37:55.265 --> 03:37:55.965]  Yeah.
[03:37:56.145 --> 03:37:59.587]  And he seemed a little bit, I'm not saying he's open to it or whatever, but he wasn't shocked by it.
[03:37:59.607 --> 03:38:00.548]  He's like, give me your phone number.
[03:38:00.568 --> 03:38:01.389]  Give me, you know, I'll talk to you.
[03:38:01.429 --> 03:38:01.749]  Yeah.
[03:38:01.829 --> 03:38:03.650]  And then he hit your producer, please give me his number right now.
[03:38:03.810 --> 03:38:04.771]  Yeah, that was interesting.
[03:38:04.931 --> 03:38:06.212]  But I was being silly with him.
[03:38:06.832 --> 03:38:09.074]  But there was also a line, he goes, oh, Alex Jones.
[03:38:10.174 --> 03:38:11.475]  I said, I want you to come on my show.
[03:38:11.495 --> 03:38:13.176]  And he said, oh, you still got a show?
[03:38:13.817 --> 03:38:15.698]  And I went, no, you're the one that doesn't have a show.
[03:38:17.692 --> 03:38:21.895]  Sorry, I said it so boorish to like recount conversations people were witnessing.
[03:38:21.915 --> 03:38:22.415]  It was funny though.
[03:38:22.435 --> 03:38:27.298]  But you said, you know, you're off TV now, but you were a real star.
[03:38:27.358 --> 03:38:29.359]  I mean, not on CNN, but on my show.
[03:38:31.200 --> 03:38:31.721]  So good.
[03:38:32.281 --> 03:38:40.986]  Anyway, but what was interesting was if someone had talked about you that way and then called you late night after a couple of drinks, you'd say, you know, up yours, pal.
[03:38:41.647 --> 03:38:42.347]  You know what I mean?
[03:38:42.367 --> 03:38:43.908]  Like buzz off or I'm not taking your call.
[03:38:43.948 --> 03:38:45.289]  But he kind of sucked up to you.
[03:38:45.309 --> 03:38:48.751]   That's a very weird, Passive-aggressive posture.
[03:38:48.831 --> 03:38:53.794]  Well, I've said a lot of really mean things about him and attacked him, and when I watch the clips out of context, I feel guilty.
[03:38:54.334 --> 03:38:56.355]  But he was going around with Oliver Darcy.
[03:38:56.375 --> 03:38:59.477]  They would brag on Twitter and literally hitting hundreds of my sponsors.
[03:38:59.817 --> 03:39:01.198]  And I say hundreds, I'd have like 20.
[03:39:01.258 --> 03:39:01.858]  They'd take them all.
[03:39:02.118 --> 03:39:03.199]  I get 20 more, take them all.
[03:39:03.359 --> 03:39:04.159]  This went on for years.
[03:39:04.460 --> 03:39:06.381]  So you go get a sponsor, you get them, they're doing great.
[03:39:06.761 --> 03:39:07.781]  He takes it away from you.
[03:39:07.981 --> 03:39:13.905]  And then he brags that him and Darcy... I was taken off Twitter, not for the Sandy Hook stuff that came later that they focused on.
[03:39:14.285 --> 03:39:14.725]  Look it up.
[03:39:15.205 --> 03:39:20.131]   They had The former head of Twitter and the lawyer on Joe Rogan about four years ago.
[03:39:20.652 --> 03:39:22.053]  And Joe said, why did you ban Alex Jones?
[03:39:22.073 --> 03:39:24.154]  The lawyer goes, OK, let me open my clipboard.
[03:39:24.454 --> 03:39:25.235]  She goes, here's why.
[03:39:25.655 --> 03:39:27.417]  He was mean to Oliver Darcy.
[03:39:27.877 --> 03:39:28.998]  So I'm at the Capitol.
[03:39:29.018 --> 03:39:30.399]  They're having censorship hearings.
[03:39:30.799 --> 03:39:31.840]  Sundar Pichai is there.
[03:39:31.880 --> 03:39:32.920]  I just confronted him in the hall.
[03:39:33.061 --> 03:39:33.681]  Who runs Google.
[03:39:33.520 --> 03:39:52.559]  And you guys are welcome to use that if you want.
[03:39:52.590 --> 03:39:54.151]  You bet on the wrong country, Sundar!
[03:39:54.211 --> 03:39:57.092]  Here he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:39:57.152 --> 03:40:02.955]  That guy has had his people in the whole Congress around censoring, and they lied to Congress.
[03:40:03.916 --> 03:40:07.877]  I think you'd be arrested just like that Chinese spy got arrested in Camden two weeks ago.
[03:40:08.017 --> 03:40:10.398]  All these people piss on their dirt.
[03:40:10.438 --> 03:40:11.178]  Sundar!
[03:40:11.198 --> 03:40:18.381]  You know you're not an American because you can't work with comic Chinese.
[03:40:18.541 --> 03:40:21.822]  You can't work with comic Chinese, Sundar.
[03:40:21.862 --> 03:40:26.444]  You can't work with comic Chinese on braggart plot censoring and rounding up the dissidents.
[03:40:27.384 --> 03:40:29.345]  Sundar is arresting dissidents in China!
[03:40:29.565 --> 03:40:32.506]  Apple's working with China to suppress their people!
[03:40:33.306 --> 03:40:35.609]  Sundar, you're engaged in treason.
[03:40:35.629 --> 03:40:39.093]  You've had Google executives lie to Congress that you're not censoring conservatives.
[03:40:39.713 --> 03:40:41.536]  Sundar, you will not silence the people.
[03:40:42.517 --> 03:40:45.920]  Your censorship will not work anymore, Sundar.
[03:40:46.361 --> 03:40:50.846]  We're aware of your activities, trying to muzzle the American people and gaming your search results.
[03:40:51.706 --> 03:41:09.065]  FRIEND (dist food collector, sounding out "Google is evil")
[03:41:09.364 --> 03:41:09.724]  Google is evil!
[03:41:10.764 --> 03:41:11.125]  Google is evil!
[03:41:11.785 --> 03:41:12.145]  Google is evil!
[03:41:13.185 --> 03:41:13.666]  Google is evil!
[03:41:14.446 --> 03:41:15.146]  Google is evil!
[03:41:15.847 --> 03:41:16.587]  Google is evil!
[03:41:17.347 --> 03:41:18.048]  Google is evil!
[03:41:18.828 --> 03:41:19.308]  Google is evil!
[03:41:20.248 --> 03:41:20.629]  Google is evil!
[03:41:21.349 --> 03:41:21.669]  Google is evil!
[03:41:22.689 --> 03:41:23.090]  Google is evil!
[03:41:23.810 --> 03:41:24.150]  Google is evil!
[03:41:24.930 --> 03:41:25.271]  Google is evil!
[03:41:26.531 --> 03:41:26.831]  Google is evil!
[03:41:27.552 --> 03:41:27.852]  Google is evil!
[03:41:28.612 --> 03:41:28.972]  Google is evil!
[03:41:29.692 --> 03:41:29.993]  Google is evil!
[03:41:31.573 --> 03:41:32.414]  Google is evil!
[03:41:32.554 --> 03:41:37.516]  Google is going to lie again and violate the law and violate the laws of others!
[03:41:37.996 --> 03:41:39.377]  You're in a hallway, you're in a public hallway.
[03:41:39.397 --> 03:41:40.657]  You're going to be arrested.
[03:41:40.837 --> 03:41:41.297]  That's enough.
[03:41:41.317 --> 03:41:42.398]  You're making too much noise.
[03:41:42.818 --> 03:41:44.399]  So Google's not evil though, officer?
[03:41:44.619 --> 03:41:45.539]  I'm not saying that.
[03:41:45.679 --> 03:41:46.560]  Just control yourself.
[03:41:46.580 --> 03:41:46.760]  Okay.
[03:41:47.100 --> 03:41:47.880]  Get under control now.
[03:41:47.900 --> 03:41:49.061]  I'm under control, officer.
[03:41:49.661 --> 03:41:49.921]  Thank you.
[03:41:50.001 --> 03:41:53.803]  She's taken my free speech away and lied about me, so I need to stand up now.
[03:41:53.823 --> 03:41:54.843]  I'm not worried about that.
[03:41:54.863 --> 03:41:55.544]  Yes, sir, I understand.
[03:41:55.564 --> 03:41:57.364]  They're going to talk about me in this committee.
[03:41:57.604 --> 03:41:58.405]  I will be talked about.
[03:41:59.085 --> 03:41:59.886]  So what am I supposed to do?
[03:41:59.906 --> 03:42:01.247]  I don't get a day in court.
[03:42:01.707 --> 03:42:02.408]  They lie about me.
[03:42:02.828 --> 03:42:04.009]  Google only puts lies up.
[03:42:04.350 --> 03:42:06.452]  All the top searches are lies about me and my family.
[03:42:06.992 --> 03:42:14.138]  And that guy helps round the political dissonance and then his people come and lie to Congress over and over and over again and we don't get to respond to them.
[03:42:14.799 --> 03:42:22.445]  So Google is helping build censorship systems in China for a global social score they've tested there to totally control every aspect of our lives.
[03:42:23.506 --> 03:42:23.746]  Apple!
[03:42:24.207 --> 03:42:26.548]  And Tim Cook has said he wants censorship worldwide.
[03:42:26.929 --> 03:42:31.011]  They're working with the Communist Chinese that have killed five times what Hitler did.
[03:42:31.031 --> 03:42:32.012]  Okay, Google is evil.
[03:42:32.031 --> 03:42:36.700]   for the court united states congress yet google is a left or to the right
[03:42:36.700 --> 03:42:44.470]   of the google is evil and i will tell you that i have a lot of the world
[03:42:44.470 --> 03:42:49.831]   so here you go for a few people that we've been talking about the internet's
[03:42:49.831 --> 03:42:53.152]   the most prominent i'm not a bad guy right now we're here simply
[03:42:53.152 --> 03:42:59.541]   trying to tell you a lot of all the stand-up what's right now the american and
[03:42:59.541 --> 03:43:08.271]   that's what's going on the service
[03:43:08.271 --> 03:43:16.231]   literally helps china round up their people has put a censorship system in their and here
[03:43:16.231 --> 03:43:18.511]   we're going to let them know that they're not going to sit there and
[03:43:18.511 --> 03:43:22.390]   silence us and we're gonna speak out and we're going to start doing
[03:43:22.390 --> 03:43:26.191]   this is a poor terry has a discounted this country and sundar
[03:43:26.191 --> 03:43:31.311]   and google party absolutely most people corporation on earth
[03:43:31.311 --> 03:43:36.931]   and then that was at the senate So now they were going over to a house meeting, and there's Oliver Darcy in the line.
[03:43:36.971 --> 03:43:37.651]  He gets to get in.
[03:43:37.671 --> 03:43:40.173]  I don't even get into a hearing where they then attacked me.
[03:43:40.494 --> 03:43:43.176]  They'd attacked me at the last hearing, but I don't get to face my accuser.
[03:43:43.696 --> 03:43:44.557]  And so I get in his face.
[03:43:44.577 --> 03:43:46.919]  I don't threaten him, but I say, you are an evil man.
[03:43:46.979 --> 03:43:51.802]  You're un-American, coming after my free speech, harassing my sponsors, trying to get me off the internet.
[03:43:52.103 --> 03:43:53.644]  And the last place I was on was Twitter.
[03:43:54.024 --> 03:43:54.665]  They'd held out.
[03:43:55.765 --> 03:43:57.927]  And so, Jack Dorsey had held out.
[03:43:58.627 --> 03:44:02.449]  And so, Jack Dorsey admitted, well, the last straw was, I bullied Oliver Darcy.
[03:44:03.310 --> 03:44:05.031]  And so, that's why I was deplatformed.
[03:44:05.331 --> 03:44:06.972]  Elon Musk thinks it was the Sandy Hook thing.
[03:44:07.892 --> 03:44:12.835]  Do you know that in most cultures, bullying Oliver Darcy would be like a rite of passage?
[03:44:12.855 --> 03:44:15.437]  Like you couldn't, like that would be a positive good, right?
[03:44:15.917 --> 03:44:16.677]  Well, here's the thing.
[03:44:16.837 --> 03:44:20.960]  He's literally on Twitter, taking my sponsors, calling for me to be silenced.
[03:44:21.420 --> 03:44:25.166]  So he's been attacking me, attacking my speech and my living.
[03:44:25.647 --> 03:44:31.155]  And then all I do is shove a camera in his face while he's waiting to go into the hearing for five minutes and say, man, you are un-American.
[03:44:31.476 --> 03:44:33.179]  You, you, you got some evil eyes.
[03:44:33.739 --> 03:44:35.662]  And I said, you really look like a piece of slime.
[03:44:35.682 --> 03:44:36.343]  I mean, I told him that.
[03:44:36.964 --> 03:44:37.725]  Fair, fair.
[03:44:38.205 --> 03:44:47.349]  And so the point is he's a man, he's a quote journalist in the arena, he goes around harassing people and stalking them financially and in their free speech.
[03:44:48.009 --> 03:44:54.913]  He'd already bragged that he'd gotten me taken off all this other stuff and that he was instrumental, which he was, and that he can't take me saying, man you're a jerk.
[03:44:56.055 --> 03:44:57.376]  You called for us to be the platform.
[03:44:57.676 --> 03:44:58.236]  You pushed it.
[03:44:58.516 --> 03:44:59.616]  Now you say it's not even happening.
[03:44:59.656 --> 03:45:00.077]  It is true.
[03:45:00.477 --> 03:45:01.577]  CNN lobbied for it.
[03:45:01.757 --> 03:45:04.658]  That's all CNN did was call for me to be taken off the air.
[03:45:04.678 --> 03:45:05.579]  That's all you've done.
[03:45:05.619 --> 03:45:07.019]  That's what you said needs to be taken down.
[03:45:07.279 --> 03:45:08.140]  Why aren't you taking it down?
[03:45:08.460 --> 03:45:14.542]  You think because you've got some Democrats and some committees and some stay-behind networks like the 37 angry Democrats and the Justice Department trying to shut down Trump?
[03:45:14.782 --> 03:45:19.864]  You think because you've got a rogue group operating inside those agencies that you're going to be able to shut down the free press in America?
[03:45:19.924 --> 03:45:20.484]  We are here.
[03:45:20.724 --> 03:45:21.625]  Paul Revere is here.
[03:45:21.805 --> 03:45:24.105]  The American people are watching and they're not going to let you win.
[03:45:25.846 --> 03:45:29.629]  If I could rig the playing field and shut everybody else down, I might be a real boy someday.
[03:45:30.009 --> 03:45:36.354]  If I could get to work for a big corporation and shut everybody down, I might be a big boy.
[03:45:36.374 --> 03:45:38.116]  So this is the classic posture.
[03:45:38.776 --> 03:45:43.160]  You know, stop hitting me, he says, as he fires a gun through your windshield.
[03:45:43.380 --> 03:45:44.120]  Exactly.
[03:45:44.140 --> 03:45:45.862]  They can dish it out, but they can't take it.
[03:45:46.062 --> 03:45:47.523]  So what's the effect on you?
[03:45:47.923 --> 03:45:54.969]  And I don't mean even the lawsuits against you, and there was an effort to criminally indict you, I guess, just for having bad opinions or whatever.
[03:45:55.469 --> 03:45:56.350]  Actually, a bunch of them, yeah.
[03:45:56.370 --> 03:45:59.393]  They've had four grand juries I've had to respond to, subpoenas.
[03:46:00.234 --> 03:46:09.563]  When you've committed no crime, you're like one of the only people in the media who's not ginning up race hatred, I would say, just to be totally clear, because it's very common to do that.
[03:46:09.583 --> 03:46:11.044]  You don't do that.
[03:46:11.605 --> 03:46:16.630]  So anyway, and then, of course, this billion-dollar judgment against you for having naughty opinions, which is insane.
[03:46:17.608 --> 03:46:18.328]  I'm not even talking about that.
[03:46:18.569 --> 03:46:28.834]  I just mean, what's it like to spend 25, 30 years connecting the dots and seeing this slow-moving storm come toward the country that you were born in?
[03:46:29.434 --> 03:46:32.236]  What effect does it have on you?
[03:46:32.476 --> 03:46:44.202]  Since you use the analogy of a storm, it'd be like if I was 100 years ago before they had radar, and I've read about the famous flood 120-something years ago in Galveston that killed tens of thousands of people.
[03:46:44.222 --> 03:46:44.962]  Yeah, the hurricane, yeah.
[03:46:45.002 --> 03:46:45.522]  Yeah, the hurricane.
[03:46:45.542 --> 03:46:46.683]  They didn't have radar.
[03:46:47.503 --> 03:47:09.525]  And so they didn't know, but you know, they're the fishermen out there catching shrimp or whatever, and then all of a sudden here comes basically a tidal wave, and if I was one of those fishermen, and I knew my children and my wife were on shore at school or work or whatever, and here comes a 40-50 foot wave I know is about to kill them, I would not be thinking about myself watching this giant wave come in.
[03:47:09.565 --> 03:47:12.862]   I'd go, oh my god, My wife and kids are over there.
[03:47:12.942 --> 03:47:14.923]  And so it's not that I'm a hero.
[03:47:14.963 --> 03:47:16.003]  It's not even a selflessness.
[03:47:16.284 --> 03:47:31.772]  I realized that I was just out in front and ahead of some people in understanding this because of family and research and just, you know, things in my life that I saw that encouraged me to get involved in the media because I was aware of the globalism, some things that were going on because my uncle was high level.
[03:47:31.812 --> 03:47:35.654]  I ran Contra, had some other family that, you know, worked in clandestine things.
[03:47:35.974 --> 03:47:40.824]   So I kind of grew up just around folks that knew what was really going on.
[03:47:40.824 --> 03:47:44.183]   And you're a kid, you don't really pay attention to it, but you kind of get that education,
[03:47:44.183 --> 03:47:45.983]  even though you don't know you're getting it.
[03:47:45.983 --> 03:47:48.343]  And so I've just been out front.
[03:47:48.343 --> 03:47:53.542]   So I would liken it to the old days when a dam would break and they didn't have radio to warn people,
[03:47:53.542 --> 03:47:56.543]   and the dam breaks and it's 20 foot wave coming down the valley,
[03:47:56.543 --> 03:48:02.423]   and you are down below the dam as, let's say a lumberjack,
[03:48:02.423 --> 03:48:07.404]   and you know your wife and children are two miles down, and you see the dam break and you're about to drown,
[03:48:07.404 --> 03:48:11.002]   But I guarantee the last thought you're thinking is, it's gonna get my women and children.
[03:48:11.066 --> 03:48:15.349]  And that's really, my grief is, this is really draconian.
[03:48:15.389 --> 03:48:30.105]   This globalist, Great Reset, New World Order Takeover, it's a post-industrial world, cut off the resources, 90% forced depopulation, breaking civilization by design, massive wars, famine, they've already cut off a third of the fertilizer in the last year worldwide.
[03:48:30.445 --> 03:48:32.287]  It's estimated that'll kill a couple hundred million people.
[03:48:32.828 --> 03:48:34.830]  The lockdowns worldwide, not the virus, the U.N.
[03:48:34.870 --> 03:48:38.014]  admits killed 87 million extra people in the last three and a half years.
[03:48:39.414 --> 03:48:41.695]  And so when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[03:48:41.955 --> 03:48:43.396]  And then what's left of them floods us.
[03:48:43.836 --> 03:48:47.237]  And so the earth is being put into a countdown collapse right now.
[03:48:47.717 --> 03:48:53.780]  And so I'm like the fisherman when the tidal wave comes in and I'm like, oh my God, my wife and children are about to die.
[03:48:53.800 --> 03:48:57.421]  And so I'm not really worried about me because I'm a man.
[03:48:57.501 --> 03:48:57.981]  I did this.
[03:48:58.061 --> 03:48:58.681]  I knew it was coming.
[03:48:58.701 --> 03:48:59.422]  I've been proven right.
[03:48:59.822 --> 03:49:01.142]  And I'm not happy I was proven right.
[03:49:01.462 --> 03:49:02.903]  I wish we could have gotten ahead of this.
[03:49:04.103 --> 03:49:06.105]  Yeah, we have a lot of credibility now.
[03:49:06.445 --> 03:49:09.487]  The people see that we were right, so maybe we can stop the next phase of it.
[03:49:10.328 --> 03:49:15.992]  But the globalists have gone from testing phase, beta test phase, into full operational now.
[03:49:16.313 --> 03:49:20.616]  And they say, read their writings, we are going to have a post-industrial world by 2030.
[03:49:20.976 --> 03:49:22.617]  We will have no personal cars by 2030.
[03:49:22.978 --> 03:49:23.979]  You will be eating bugs by 2030.
[03:49:25.453 --> 03:49:30.040]  And we will start the depopulation of 90% of the people by 2045.
[03:49:30.120 --> 03:49:35.649]  That is the official WF, official UN, official Club of Rome plan.
[03:49:35.689 --> 03:49:37.292]  What do you mean the depopulation?
[03:49:38.373 --> 03:49:40.116]  They want to bring the world population down to 500 million.
[03:49:42.654 --> 03:49:44.656]  But I thought we were opposed to genocide, no?
[03:49:45.136 --> 03:49:46.157]  Or no, I guess we're not.
[03:49:46.357 --> 03:49:48.999]  Well, you know, we're told now, don't have children, it's bad for the Earth.
[03:49:49.699 --> 03:50:00.367]  And we're told all this, and Elon Musk is right, and is a hero for pointing out all the actuaries show, if you don't have 2.1 children, a man and a woman, people go, well a man and a woman can have 2.1, it's just in the aggregate folks out of billions.
[03:50:01.067 --> 03:50:08.433]  If a country doesn't have 2.1, 2.2 replacement rate, then you don't have people to take care of the old folks, society collapses.
[03:50:09.214 --> 03:50:11.682]  And so, Japan's 1.3, Italy's 1.3, they're done as cultures.
[03:50:14.066 --> 03:50:18.308]  America, without immigrant influx, is about 1.6.
[03:50:19.268 --> 03:50:19.969]  That's not viable.
[03:50:20.969 --> 03:50:25.791]  And so, and I'm not just talking about white people only here, but white people are 7% of the world population.
[03:50:26.051 --> 03:50:26.431]  Maybe 8.
[03:50:27.592 --> 03:50:31.073]  And so, I would be sad if the last of the Eskimos were dying.
[03:50:31.593 --> 03:50:36.135]  I'm sad that the Japanese, within 100 years, there might be 20 million of them.
[03:50:36.255 --> 03:50:46.387]   But just to my previous question about, and without getting too personal, I mean, I feel a little bit enervated and down just hearing your dot connecting here.
[03:50:46.467 --> 03:50:48.848]  Like, what's the effect on you over 25 years?
[03:50:48.868 --> 03:50:59.113]  I mean, if you literally foresee 9-11 before it happens, and you did and it can be proven, we just proved it, like, what is that, what's that like to live with that weird ability?
[03:50:59.693 --> 03:51:01.154]  Well, I mean, I know a specific clip.
[03:51:02.481 --> 03:51:06.522]   I specifically say call the White House, tell them we know they're gonna let Al-Qaeda attack us,
[03:51:06.522 --> 03:51:08.721]  bin Laden, and then take our rights.
[03:51:08.721 --> 03:51:10.002]  I say call the White House.
[03:51:10.002 --> 03:51:14.641]   I put the number out, so I put the money where my mouth was, and that's the only time I ever said call the White House
[03:51:14.641 --> 03:51:16.381]  and tell them stop a particular event.
[03:51:16.381 --> 03:51:21.200]   I'm now saying we need to call the White House and say, you've let tens of thousands of military-age men
[03:51:21.200 --> 03:51:22.481]  of the Middle East in.
[03:51:22.481 --> 03:51:24.922]  We know a lot of them are Hezbollah and Hamas.
[03:51:24.922 --> 03:51:26.402]  The FBI has confirmed that.
[03:51:26.402 --> 03:51:31.041]   And so, when and if there's big terror attacks, which I believe will probably happen in America,
[03:51:31.041 --> 03:51:35.082]   we're not gonna have Homeland Security get more funds and more power and grope us at the airports more.
[03:51:35.082 --> 03:51:41.441]   I want prison time for the agencies and groups that have allowed this, and I want,
[03:51:41.441 --> 03:51:43.082]  I want, oh, Biden.
[03:51:43.082 --> 03:51:45.240]  I want Biden impeached now, okay?
[03:51:45.332 --> 03:51:46.592]  That's why we got rid of McCarthy.
[03:51:46.952 --> 03:51:47.712]  It needs to happen.
[03:51:48.052 --> 03:51:57.674]  Leaving the border open, when there is a clear and present danger of this going on, and when we're very close to a war with Iran, we go to war with Iran, they're going to activate Hezbollah.
[03:51:57.694 --> 03:52:00.235]  They make Hamas look like choirboys.
[03:52:01.435 --> 03:52:04.636]  You want to hear a prediction here, it's a probability, not a pure prediction.
[03:52:06.972 --> 03:52:09.813]  If we go to war with Iran, guaranteed sleeper cells activate.
[03:52:10.354 --> 03:52:12.755]  It'll make what happened in Israel look tame in comparison.
[03:52:12.775 --> 03:52:13.875]  I'm not blessing what happened there.
[03:52:14.255 --> 03:52:16.676]  So, I'm simply... And then again, where's the logic?
[03:52:16.936 --> 03:52:19.557]  The government that allows that to happen should go to prison.
[03:52:20.058 --> 03:52:20.398]  I agree.
[03:52:20.418 --> 03:52:23.019]  But instead, like 9-11, they're going to get more power when it happens.
[03:52:23.359 --> 03:52:23.999]  Mark my words.
[03:52:24.540 --> 03:52:30.202]  So, so... You can't have guns because we let in foreign sleeper cells to kill you.
[03:52:30.502 --> 03:52:30.942]  Exactly.
[03:52:30.982 --> 03:52:31.983]  And you asked the question.
[03:52:33.223 --> 03:52:38.924]  This is really taking a toll on me, not the fake lawsuits, not the weaponization, not the deplatforming.
[03:52:39.945 --> 03:52:49.847]  I was already getting exhausted five, six years ago, and when I married my second wife, who's amazing, I have three children with my previous wife, and they're all great children, and one with her.
[03:52:50.327 --> 03:52:52.528]  We were in Hawaii getting married like seven years ago.
[03:52:53.448 --> 03:52:59.835]  And I said to her, I said, I want to just write books and make documentary films and maybe do an occasional podcast.
[03:53:00.476 --> 03:53:07.623]  At that time, I've been on air like 20, 22 years, six days a week, three hours a day at least.
[03:53:09.725 --> 03:53:11.947]  I said, I just don't want this burden, this big crew.
[03:53:11.987 --> 03:53:13.548]  I love the crew, but I don't want to do this anymore.
[03:53:13.849 --> 03:53:22.196]  I said, I want to move the country, and I want to just, you know, because it's taking a physical toll to every day, look at this stuff.
[03:53:22.316 --> 03:53:28.121]  And now I've gotten to the point, which even though I say don't let them break your will, don't let them demoralize you, that's because I understand the process.
[03:53:28.381 --> 03:53:28.981]  It's happened to me.
[03:53:29.522 --> 03:53:32.004]  Used to, I'd have hundreds of incredible stories and clips every day.
[03:53:32.084 --> 03:53:33.826]  I couldn't wait to expose the bad guys.
[03:53:34.486 --> 03:53:41.001]  Now I look at it once, I'm ready, I study it, and then half the time I get on air and I just go, let's just take calls.
[03:53:41.909 --> 03:53:56.513]  Or I start talking about some fun story just because I mentally cannot sit there and stare into the abyss and stare at Biden or their press secretary that's meant to enrage us and demoralize us.
[03:53:57.173 --> 03:53:59.134]  And I think that's a defense mechanism that's healthy.
[03:53:59.174 --> 03:54:00.274]  So I think we all have to be balanced.
[03:54:00.674 --> 03:54:02.355]  I'm not asking people to only fight tyranny.
[03:54:03.475 --> 03:54:06.576]  I'm asking people to get prepared, get ready, but wake up as many people as you can.
[03:54:07.336 --> 03:54:14.223]  And then do whatever you have to to stay sane because this, we have record suicide, we have record depression, we have record drug abuse.
[03:54:14.964 --> 03:54:17.166]  This country has been attacked.
[03:54:17.726 --> 03:54:20.009]  And if you read deeper in the Globalist writings, they admit they're doing it.
[03:54:20.989 --> 03:54:22.431]  And so we have to be aware of it.
[03:54:22.451 --> 03:54:27.476]  If you're aware of an attack and aware of a manipulation, it doesn't give you full immunity from it.
[03:54:29.184 --> 03:54:29.765]  No, it doesn't.
[03:54:29.885 --> 03:54:32.126]  But it gives you a buffer.
[03:54:32.146 --> 03:54:43.455]  Imagine people that don't know what's going on, and they really believe things are dangerous, things are bad, not because of the corrupt corporations that are running things, but because those evil people in the countryside that want to be left alone.
[03:54:43.815 --> 03:54:44.976]  That's what they're saying on the news.
[03:54:45.456 --> 03:54:47.498]  It's the people in the middle of nowhere that want to be left alone.
[03:54:47.778 --> 03:54:51.101]  They're the bad guys, and it's the five-year-old kid that's white.
[03:54:51.581 --> 03:54:52.222]  They're really bad.
[03:54:52.262 --> 03:54:53.382]  They're all inherently really bad.
[03:54:53.402 --> 03:55:08.247]   This is a Demonic assault and it really is good versus evil, but the key part you raised earlier In previous shows that I mentioned I didn't get into there's so many topics is this When you said we need to brood on death
[03:55:10.736 --> 03:55:14.019]  You talk about a simpatico or a synchronicity or a weird moment.
[03:55:14.999 --> 03:55:19.262]  I don't usually watch your show when it first releases one day because I'm usually at work or doing stuff at night.
[03:55:19.522 --> 03:55:26.907]  But I'll get up at like 4 or 5 in the morning, hours before my wife and daughter get up, and I will start, you know, get on the desktop, start doing research.
[03:55:26.947 --> 03:55:32.531]  And when I'm reading news and sending stuff to the crew for the show, I'll almost always go click on your show to watch it.
[03:55:33.530 --> 03:55:36.471]  And that's the go-to thing I'll have on the background.
[03:55:37.211 --> 03:55:41.413]  And I said, well, I'm not gonna click on the show, I'm gonna click on the speech you gave a few weeks ago.
[03:55:41.453 --> 03:55:44.554]  And you talked about brooding on death.
[03:55:44.654 --> 03:56:22.934]   And I'm sitting there that week, literally thinking about the fact that we've gotta be humble, we've gotta be thankful, we've gotta realize that there's an infinite universe and consciousness, and that focusing on what made humanity, focusing on the fact that we are spiritual beings, but that this life is finite, These incredible experiences, all the people we've met and known, and all the ancestors before us that did incredible things and went through hell and were tough as nails to get us here, really ties us into our ancestors and the epigenetic instinctive knowledge that really makes us a colony or hybrid creature of all of our ancestors.
[03:56:22.954 --> 03:56:32.272]   We have a soul, we have a spirit, we have our genetic Imprint that they've proven mathematically is multi-dimensional even about the third dimension.
[03:56:32.292 --> 03:56:47.700]  So we have a personal spirit but really we also have a collective bodysuit that is a collection of all of our ancestors and just the beauty and the wonderment and the spectacularness of that dwelling on how incredible that is.
[03:56:48.260 --> 03:56:54.088]  But also leaning into eternity and leaning in to this body and this incarnation.
[03:56:54.108 --> 03:57:00.556]  And I'm not saying reincarnation, incarnation, but being so magical.
[03:57:01.505 --> 03:57:01.665]  Yes.
[03:57:01.504 --> 03:57:07.625]   and that also that death is the great equalizer and that you will be humbled and you will get old
[03:57:07.625 --> 03:57:12.664]   and your teeth will fall out and your hair will fall out and you will get cancer or you will have a heart attack
[03:57:12.664 --> 03:57:17.824]   and no matter how powerful you are, you're not in control in that it tunes you into God
[03:57:17.824 --> 03:57:23.063]   and then what you said, so I'm heavily focused on this and telling my wife this and I meet with my dad
[03:57:23.063 --> 03:57:27.584]   who's really my mom, I don't see them as much as I should but my dad's really always told me this
[03:57:27.584 --> 03:57:32.183]   and I didn't really get it when I was younger, now I get it as I get older and I'm sitting there
[03:57:32.183 --> 03:57:37.984]   just literally praying that morning and drinking coffee and just focusing on death and just focusing on life
[03:57:37.984 --> 03:57:41.903]   'cause when you focus on death, it makes life so much bigger and focusing on what,
[03:57:41.903 --> 03:57:44.863]   I'm not a Hindu and I'm not a, So, thank you.
[03:57:44.709 --> 03:57:49.909]   Sikh, but the Sikhs are like a 500-year-old version of 3000-year-old Hinduism, and they
[03:57:49.909 --> 03:57:54.388]   think everything's a manifestation of God in the universe around us, and then interfacing
[03:57:54.388 --> 03:57:58.548]   and how we take every moment of how magic it is, is what's going to resonate in the
[03:57:58.548 --> 03:58:02.669]   future to bring us close to God, so that we basically resonate into the higher dimension
[03:58:02.669 --> 03:58:06.949]   with God, and that's really been my instinctive understanding of it, spiritual understanding
[03:58:06.668 --> 03:58:10.709]   Understanding the dream understanding of it. I didn't read books and I read what the seats are saying
[03:58:10.709 --> 03:58:15.789]   It's basically I was reading some of their writings just a month ago and it was about focusing on death
[03:58:15.789 --> 03:58:21.108]   So you also understand life and being humble and being a servant and now that's what empowers you
[03:58:21.108 --> 03:58:23.968]   So you're not an asshole like your dad would tell you, you know, you know
[03:58:23.968 --> 03:58:28.109]   You know focus on the fact that I'm an asshole. It shouldn't be we all have the asshole side
[03:58:28.109 --> 03:58:31.958]   Yes, you have a better quote But the of your dad's quote the root of all wisdom is
[03:58:31.958 --> 03:58:35.938]   knowing what an asshole you are And it really is my dad always says the root of all thing
[03:58:35.938 --> 03:58:39.128]   is being humble and appreciating things and not getting on a power trip
[03:58:40.086 --> 03:58:40.286]  Yeah.
[03:58:40.566 --> 03:58:42.907]  And so, because that's wise men.
[03:58:43.507 --> 03:58:51.292]  And so, I'm sitting there totally focused for like, I wouldn't call it meditation, but 30 minutes, just sitting there in the dark with the computer screen on.
[03:58:52.032 --> 03:58:54.414]  And I go, no, I'm not going to watch Tucker's show from yesterday.
[03:58:54.434 --> 03:58:55.434]  I'm going to watch this speech.
[03:58:56.155 --> 03:58:59.697]  And I click it, and I'm like 10 minutes in, and you go, we've got to sing everything I'm singing.
[03:58:59.717 --> 03:59:01.017]  I haven't even said this on air.
[03:59:01.297 --> 03:59:03.699]  I'm hearing you say basically the same thing as it's a universal truth.
[03:59:04.841 --> 03:59:06.905]  Then I want to bring the next piece to it, which you talked about.
[03:59:07.085 --> 03:59:12.215]  You grew up in the super wealthy area of California when you weren't, you know, spending your summers here in Maine.
[03:59:12.235 --> 03:59:15.801]  And speaking for you, I watch you all the time and read your material.
[03:59:16.042 --> 03:59:16.643]  It's beautiful.
[03:59:17.344 --> 03:59:23.550]   And You were talking about how they're totally freaked out and neurotic and crazy because no one talks about death.
[03:59:23.871 --> 03:59:25.352]  Everybody shelves away the old people.
[03:59:25.392 --> 03:59:28.455]  They basically put them out on an ice float or, you know, burn them like the Vikings.
[03:59:29.176 --> 03:59:35.481]  And that by doing that, that's what makes them not be connected to reason and God and the deeper things.
[03:59:35.762 --> 03:59:36.783]  And that's why they're so lost.
[03:59:36.823 --> 03:59:37.443]  That's totally true.
[03:59:37.643 --> 03:59:39.946]  So let me now take you one step further in this.
[03:59:40.720 --> 03:59:42.541]  The globalists are so scared of death.
[03:59:42.561 --> 03:59:49.964]  They have all this money, all this power, all this control, so they're obsessed with finding life-essential technology, merging with machines, becoming gods.
[03:59:50.004 --> 03:59:50.904]  That's their new religion.
[03:59:50.944 --> 03:59:51.925]  That's the transhumanism.
[03:59:52.465 --> 03:59:53.585]  And that's where all their funding goes.
[03:59:53.765 --> 03:59:55.986]  But that's only one side of the coin.
[03:59:56.747 --> 04:00:00.728]  The other side is that if you're going to be God, you've got to be in charge of death.
[04:00:01.689 --> 04:00:08.049]   So because they fear death and they project their hatred of themselves onto us, then if they can poison us,
[04:00:08.049 --> 04:00:14.048]   dumb us down, sterilize us, depopulate us, they believe that's more for them at a very greedy level.
[04:00:14.048 --> 04:00:20.028]   So they wanna be death, the destroyer of worlds, to quote Oppenheimer, I become death, destroyer of worlds,
[04:00:20.028 --> 04:00:21.488]  and at the same time, cheat death.
[04:00:21.488 --> 04:00:27.809]   So it's a total subconscious obsession with death instead of consciously focusing on it, getting over it.
[04:00:27.809 --> 04:00:33.129]   Instead, they turn it loose to their animal, lower alligator brain, and are now manifesting all this
[04:00:33.129 --> 04:00:37.469]   because they've not embraced the higher level Yes, I agree with that completely.
[04:00:38.149 --> 04:00:40.090]  But it's doomed as a project, no?
[04:00:40.210 --> 04:00:41.731]  I mean, it is the Tower of Babel.
[04:00:41.771 --> 04:00:54.631]   Whenever you see, and history is the story of this, people drunk on their own power, overstating their control over things, Becoming convinced they're God and then being destroyed.
[04:00:54.751 --> 04:00:58.194]  I mean, that is just, I mean, it is just an endless loop of that story.
[04:00:58.234 --> 04:00:59.295]  It's a law of humans.
[04:00:59.495 --> 04:01:00.976]  It's a law, exactly.
[04:01:01.756 --> 04:01:03.478]  So this can't, I mean, this isn't going to work.
[04:01:03.858 --> 04:01:05.559]  They're going to blow up the world before they do this.
[04:01:05.639 --> 04:01:06.420]  It's just not possible.
[04:01:06.440 --> 04:01:08.782]  You just stole my thunder, because we've not talked before this.
[04:01:09.242 --> 04:01:11.304]  We've talked about a lot of stuff, but nothing about the show, really.
[04:01:12.584 --> 04:01:15.287]  It's a law, just like gravity, just like 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[04:01:17.231 --> 04:01:22.873]  It is the fabric of the universe, and I was about to say, in the past, megalomaniacs tried to control everything.
[04:01:22.893 --> 04:01:24.834]  Order of the Firstborn, you know, killed.
[04:01:24.894 --> 04:01:28.755]  Almost every kingdom would do that, whether it was Egypt or the Druids.
[04:01:29.095 --> 04:01:31.656]  Oh, there's too many young men being born, kill them.
[04:01:31.896 --> 04:01:33.237]  Depopulation has always been there.
[04:01:33.557 --> 04:01:37.238]  In the time of Plato, 2,500 years ago, he thought the world was overpopulated.
[04:01:37.678 --> 04:01:45.782]  That's kind of where the eugenics comes from and where they get these ideas, you know, the greatest philosopher ever, who said a lot of great things but also said there's too many Greeks, we need to kill most of them.
[04:01:46.122 --> 04:01:49.544]  You know, they're animals, they're dumb, we need to control breeding, it only makes supermen.
[04:01:49.924 --> 04:01:52.126]  That's where Hitler got all that, that's where all this comes from.
[04:01:53.206 --> 04:01:59.909]  The central issue here is, in the past civilizations would just fall apart when they got into a decadent phase.
[04:02:00.689 --> 04:02:07.573]  Hard men make good times, good men make... Hard men make good times, good times make soft men, soft men...
[04:02:08.593 --> 04:02:09.314]  Make bad times.
[04:02:09.334 --> 04:02:10.155]  Exactly.
[04:02:10.195 --> 04:02:20.084]  And so, instead of going through that cycle and the collapse of that corrupt system, now there's biological weapons, chemical weapons, nuclear weapons, all this other advanced stuff.
[04:02:20.204 --> 04:02:43.280]   Instead, they're going to try to use the robots and all the control and the nuclear weapons to make us finally get under their mark of the beast, finally get under their unified system of control, finally get under their social credit score, which was predicted by You know, these incredibly connected people 2,000 years ago, that this would be the ultimate tyranny that was coming, almost, not almost, psychically seeing it into the future because of the great evil potential.
[04:02:43.600 --> 04:02:44.480]  Time's really a loop.
[04:02:44.860 --> 04:02:46.761]  It was looping back or bouncing back.
[04:02:47.241 --> 04:02:54.943]  Real psychics seeing into the future what was going to happen in Revelation as a potential, I believe, and it's actually a warning that we don't have to follow that course.
[04:02:55.623 --> 04:02:57.504]  And that's my own personal belief.
[04:02:59.711 --> 04:03:11.739]  So instead, whether you believe Revelation or not, the evil globalists, the selfish globalists, are using it as a blueprint and literally building the mark of the beast, casual society, where you don't just, oh, I agree to take this mark, I can buy and sell now.
[04:03:12.019 --> 04:03:15.181]  You have to worship the beast that can be seen by all on earth at the same time.
[04:03:15.482 --> 04:03:26.489]  It describes these big holograms you've got to watch and worship, and it tells you what to do, and it tells you how to live, and it says men become women, and women become men, and children are set upon their parents, and there's nothing but wickedness being invented.
[04:03:26.809 --> 04:03:38.716]  And it describes everything that's now happening and says when they roll this out, you've got to worship this world government, you've got to worship the system and do exactly what it says, or it doesn't let you buy and sell.
[04:03:39.357 --> 04:03:44.320]  And so whether people believe in the Bible or not, believe in Revelation or not, it is now manifesting.
[04:03:46.604 --> 04:03:47.685]  I don't see a lie in that.
[04:03:47.985 --> 04:03:53.689]  I don't think, I am a Christian, but I don't think you need to be one to arrive at exactly the same conclusion.
[04:03:54.390 --> 04:03:55.451]  So you live in Austin, Texas.
[04:03:55.471 --> 04:03:57.212]  You've been there since high school.
[04:03:57.792 --> 04:03:59.313]  Austin's changed a lot.
[04:04:00.154 --> 04:04:05.878]  And as you noted, it's been really overwhelmed by people from the West Coast fleeing the decayed societies that they built.
[04:04:07.540 --> 04:04:08.761]  You live among liberals now.
[04:04:09.101 --> 04:04:09.861]  What do you make of them?
[04:04:09.941 --> 04:04:10.502]  What are they like?
[04:04:11.954 --> 04:04:24.959]  I really feel sorry for them, because compared to, say, my dad's dad, like you were telling me about, your foreman or your manager knows how to do electricity, knows how to build houses, knows how to fish, hunt.
[04:04:25.540 --> 04:04:27.160]  We just saw that big moose he got today.
[04:04:28.141 --> 04:04:30.622]  These guys are impressive, and they can do everything.
[04:04:31.042 --> 04:04:32.583]  My grandfather could do everything.
[04:04:33.443 --> 04:04:38.145]  He could fix a combine with literally rubber bands and tin cans he'd cut up into pieces.
[04:04:38.665 --> 04:04:39.966]  And my dad's the same way.
[04:04:40.786 --> 04:04:50.434]   I'm a shadow of them and their can-do, and compared to liberals, I'm like Light years ahead of them.
[04:04:50.895 --> 04:04:52.055]  They live in high-rises.
[04:04:52.496 --> 04:04:53.636]  They get food delivered to them.
[04:04:54.597 --> 04:04:55.917]  They're not in reality.
[04:04:56.898 --> 04:04:58.199]  They don't have common sense.
[04:04:58.719 --> 04:05:05.562]  They go out in the most dangerous areas that I wouldn't go into armed, in places like New York, dangerous areas of Austin.
[04:05:05.903 --> 04:05:07.684]  They get stabbed, raped, murdered, killed.
[04:05:08.004 --> 04:05:10.625]  Then they defend the people, their families do, that killed them.
[04:05:11.485 --> 04:05:13.186]  They just are like pod people.
[04:05:13.847 --> 04:05:29.278]   They are just these obsolete creatures That most of them have, I guess, jobs because they work for big tech or the system, but they are just completely disconnected, domesticated, very, very politically ignorant, culturally ignorant, historically ignorant people.
[04:05:29.759 --> 04:05:30.960]  And they think they're elitist.
[04:05:30.980 --> 04:05:32.041]  They think they know a lot.
[04:05:32.401 --> 04:05:33.522]  They think they understand a lot.
[04:05:33.542 --> 04:05:34.483]  They're totally useless.
[04:05:34.963 --> 04:05:36.424]  What do they do for fun?
[04:05:36.704 --> 04:05:38.826]  Well, I was about to say, and they're the ones that want to depopulate.
[04:05:39.106 --> 04:05:43.310]   They're the ones that think that Like Bloomberg said, oh, what's a farmer do?
[04:05:43.350 --> 04:05:45.712]  It's easy to stick a seed in the ground and it grows.
[04:05:46.233 --> 04:05:47.354]  Farming is incredibly hard.
[04:05:47.775 --> 04:05:48.956]  You better know what you're doing.
[04:05:48.976 --> 04:05:50.397]  You've got to have the weather on your side.
[04:05:50.758 --> 04:05:53.360]  And it's an all-around-the-clock job.
[04:05:53.721 --> 04:05:54.942]  I've had family that are farmers.
[04:05:55.362 --> 04:05:56.864]  My dad grew up as a farmer and a rancher.
[04:05:57.364 --> 04:05:59.987]  In the summers, they would send me to work on farms and ranches.
[04:06:00.087 --> 04:06:01.108]  Best education I ever got.
[04:06:01.408 --> 04:06:01.889]  It's rough.
[04:06:02.449 --> 04:06:02.730]  It's tough.
[04:06:04.611 --> 04:06:05.812]  But is it really essential?
[04:06:05.892 --> 04:06:07.053]  Is food really essential?
[04:06:07.573 --> 04:06:12.595]  Well, we're told by John Kerry in the last few months, he says we need to cut farming.
[04:06:12.855 --> 04:06:15.637]  Now, organic farming... Is he still alive, John Kerry?
[04:06:16.037 --> 04:06:17.398]  I don't think he... I think it's a corpse.
[04:06:17.778 --> 04:06:19.118]  It seems... he seems like a corpse.
[04:06:19.158 --> 04:06:19.939]  Like a rubber face.
[04:06:20.499 --> 04:06:21.880]  An animatronic Chuck E. Cheese.
[04:06:21.960 --> 04:06:24.661]  I thought he passed years ago, but somebody told me he's still alive.
[04:06:24.721 --> 04:06:25.982]  I don't... I guess it's an open question.
[04:06:26.002 --> 04:06:30.084]  He runs around giving speeches saying we've got to cut farming or people are gonna starve.
[04:06:32.135 --> 04:06:32.675]  I'm not joking.
[04:06:33.636 --> 04:06:34.196]  I'm not joking.
[04:06:34.936 --> 04:06:35.516]  That's what I'm saying.
[04:06:35.596 --> 04:06:39.117]  Cut down trees, cut the food off, cut the fertilizer off to save people.
[04:06:40.077 --> 04:06:53.682]  Well, speaking of starving, I mean, again, as I said at the outset, and I meant this, I've never seen a single person, I don't think there ever has been a person in the history of the United States, who was not criminally charged, but was punished to the extent that you have been.
[04:06:53.702 --> 04:06:56.262]  I mean, they've really tried to drive you into the grave.
[04:06:56.322 --> 04:06:58.443]  I think to be fair, it's been worse for Trump, but I'm the second.
[04:07:00.103 --> 04:07:01.544]  Yeah, that might be right.
[04:07:01.844 --> 04:07:04.125]  He has much bigger resources, though, to back him up.
[04:07:04.325 --> 04:07:04.865]  Oh, absolutely.
[04:07:04.885 --> 04:07:05.946]  He's the head of a political party.
[04:07:05.966 --> 04:07:07.166]  I've spent everything.
[04:07:07.206 --> 04:07:08.367]  I'm completely out of money.
[04:07:08.847 --> 04:07:09.688]  I'm still hanging on.
[04:07:09.728 --> 04:07:11.369]  But yeah, Trump still has resources.
[04:07:12.069 --> 04:07:12.369]  I don't.
[04:07:12.929 --> 04:07:14.290]  They lied about my resources, too.
[04:07:14.610 --> 04:07:15.571]  Said I had all his resources.
[04:07:15.591 --> 04:07:16.791]  Now it's been proven it wasn't true.
[04:07:17.672 --> 04:07:23.454]  So yeah, they've definitely- But it was more than a billion dollar judgment against you for saying something other people didn't like, I guess?
[04:07:23.474 --> 04:07:24.075]  Well, let's be clear.
[04:07:24.675 --> 04:07:28.117]  Misrepresenting what I said, I was defaulted by both judges in Texas and Connecticut.
[04:07:29.117 --> 04:07:40.840]  And the judge said I was guilty, then wouldn't let us put on defense, and had a jury decide the damages, then they put on experts saying I was worth $400 million when I had a couple million dollars last year in my account during the last trial.
[04:07:40.860 --> 04:07:41.580]  Now I have nothing.
[04:07:41.960 --> 04:07:44.241]  I'm actually upside down right now.
[04:07:44.981 --> 04:07:50.683]  And so that's... So how are you... I mean, how are you... I mean, they've decided, like, you're not allowed to make a living in this country.
[04:07:50.723 --> 04:07:53.663]  You've been not just deplatformed, but depersoned, debanked.
[04:07:55.144 --> 04:07:56.204]  How do you make a living?
[04:07:56.724 --> 04:07:58.766]  Well, I have been maxed out personally.
[04:07:58.987 --> 04:08:05.313]  I'm in bankruptcy, but I've got a Chapter 11, some Chapter 5 reorganization for Free Speech Systems that is the company that owns InfoWars.
[04:08:05.734 --> 04:08:12.241]  And so that company is barely paying its bills and is operating, but we're barely hanging on.
[04:08:12.401 --> 04:08:18.227]  I personally never had that much stuff, contrary to what they said, so it really hasn't hurt me that much.
[04:08:19.108 --> 04:08:22.506]   you're really into fancy things or a bunch of ostentatious lifestyle,
[04:08:22.506 --> 04:08:24.427]  contrary to what they've said.
[04:08:24.427 --> 04:08:28.427]   And so we're funding the operation, we're selling products, we're--
[04:08:28.427 --> 04:08:29.387]  What are you selling?
[04:08:29.387 --> 04:08:33.987]   I mean, well, we sell books, films, T-shirts, we sell high quality supplements,
[04:08:33.987 --> 04:08:37.507]   then they call it snake oil, but we sell the same stuff private labeled,
[04:08:37.507 --> 04:08:40.868]  the whole food sales, just high end, high quality stuff.
[04:08:40.868 --> 04:08:43.747]   It's not just a fundraiser, I've got the book, "The Great Awakening,"
[04:08:43.747 --> 04:08:44.747]  "Defeating the Globalist"
[04:08:44.747 --> 04:08:46.747]  and launching the next great Renaissance.
[04:08:46.747 --> 04:08:51.547]   My last book that came out last year was a number one bestseller on the USA Today
[04:08:51.547 --> 04:08:52.948]  and Wall Street Journal, but--
[04:08:52.948 --> 04:08:55.347]  Do they list it on their list?
[04:08:55.447 --> 04:08:56.488]  They did.
[04:08:56.848 --> 04:08:59.951]  New York Times refused to even put it on the list, even though it was number one.
[04:09:00.411 --> 04:09:06.736]  This is my new book that isn't just the bad stuff they're doing with a huge breakdown with all the proof at the back.
[04:09:07.377 --> 04:09:11.640]   It is also solutions and how to counter them.
[04:09:11.680 --> 04:09:13.781]  So, this book will keep us on air.
[04:09:13.862 --> 04:09:14.782]  Plus, it's a great book.
[04:09:14.802 --> 04:09:20.106]  I hope people get it at InfoWarsTore.com, or they can also get signed copies there, or they can go to Amazon.com.
[04:09:20.126 --> 04:09:22.528]  But, yeah, this is a way to keep us on air.
[04:09:22.788 --> 04:09:24.430]  Plus, it really is an amazing book.
[04:09:24.690 --> 04:09:31.375]  If people want to see a lot of the stuff I told you, but with footnotes, so you can go right to it, everything I say.
[04:09:31.395 --> 04:09:40.222]   When I say Naval Noah Harari says the future's not human, and that the population is no longer needed, and the future's, you know, Well, there'll be no more humans.
[04:09:40.522 --> 04:09:51.267]  You can actually go to where he said it when I said that Jeffrey Epstein was running a massage slash CIA MI6 operation to blackmail top scientists to control them.
[04:09:51.607 --> 04:09:52.348]  We have links to that.
[04:09:52.648 --> 04:09:54.649]  When I say Peter Nygaard is on trial right now.
[04:09:54.888 --> 04:09:59.009]   was having women have babies, his babies, so they could abort them at eight months
[04:09:59.009 --> 04:10:04.528]   and then he could suck all their juices out and inject them into himself. A real vampire that literally
[04:10:04.528 --> 04:10:06.088]   takes the juices of his children
[04:10:06.088 --> 04:10:09.608]   puts them in his body. We have a transcript of him saying that on TV.
[04:10:09.608 --> 04:10:13.048]   Who's this? Peter Nygaard is one of the big buddies of Epstein and all them.
[04:10:13.048 --> 04:10:17.009]   He was kind of running his own Jeffrey Epstein operation, also in the Caribbean.
[04:10:17.009 --> 04:10:23.919]   So, I mean, this book is super, It's got an amazing foreword by Steve Bannon.
[04:10:24.459 --> 04:10:34.184]  And they had a great researcher, who's also a lawyer, Kent Heckenliebly, went through and double-checked everything I said for the book, obviously, so they wouldn't get sued.
[04:10:34.465 --> 04:10:36.526]  So this thing is well-researched, well-documented.
[04:10:36.866 --> 04:10:37.746]  It is The Great Awakening.
[04:10:38.027 --> 04:10:41.809]  Because The Great Awakening is the counter to The Globalist's Great Reset.
[04:10:42.549 --> 04:10:44.994]  To destroy society and then build back better.
[04:10:45.014 --> 04:10:47.139]  But it seems asymmetrical at best.
[04:10:47.179 --> 04:10:50.125]  I mean, you have all the power on the globe arrayed on one side.
[04:10:51.178 --> 04:10:56.220]  And then the majority that doesn't like it.
[04:10:57.981 --> 04:10:59.761]  How do decent people prevail?
[04:11:00.442 --> 04:11:02.442]  They believe they can push it by deception.
[04:11:03.043 --> 04:11:13.307]  That's why if people are aware of why they're cutting off the fertilizer to collapse the third world, to then flood us with those giant populations, they will then control and give voting rights to.
[04:11:13.767 --> 04:11:16.228]  And if you don't want to give them voting rights, then you're a racist.
[04:11:17.128 --> 04:11:21.235]  That's why the lockdown's biggest crime wasn't just the 80 plus million the U.N.
[04:11:21.275 --> 04:11:26.244]  estimates starved to death the last three and a half years, on top of the normal 15 million that starve to death each year.
[04:11:26.264 --> 04:11:26.845]  You looked this up.
[04:11:28.898 --> 04:11:35.982]  They then use those giant masses of people that are fleeing total collapse as their new political underclass.
[04:11:36.002 --> 04:11:43.506]  So that's why it's so vital to not just challenge the Great Reset and the New World Order eugenics operation of the transhumanists.
[04:11:43.846 --> 04:11:49.569]  It's vital to then give an alternative plan and have an alternative debate about that plan.
[04:11:49.789 --> 04:11:51.189]  And that's what The Great Awakening gets into.
[04:11:52.470 --> 04:11:55.912]  So, but if you give up on that, you also sell bourbon.
[04:11:56.636 --> 04:11:59.257]  Man, you are really being nice today, Tucker.
[04:11:59.277 --> 04:12:00.717]  Well, you know what?
[04:12:01.237 --> 04:12:03.617]  I hate selling products, but I like this product because I love the name.
[04:12:04.077 --> 04:12:04.798]  Look at this right here.
[04:12:05.318 --> 04:12:08.798]  This, my friends, is a gift to your crew because I know they drink.
[04:12:08.818 --> 04:12:11.319]  I had some drinks with them last night when we called Brian Stelter.
[04:12:12.039 --> 04:12:13.179]  Some of the crew does drink.
[04:12:13.199 --> 04:12:14.240]  Yes, that's true.
[04:12:14.300 --> 04:12:14.840]  So this is for you.
[04:12:14.860 --> 04:12:16.980]  We've got a few other bottles for you out there.
[04:12:17.620 --> 04:12:18.560]  I can't even open this thing.
[04:12:19.401 --> 04:12:19.941]  It's sealed.
[04:12:19.961 --> 04:12:21.181]  Maybe it got locked on the airplane.
[04:12:21.801 --> 04:12:22.942]  Anyways, can somebody open this?
[04:12:23.002 --> 04:12:23.963]  I'm like, you're embarrassing me.
[04:12:23.983 --> 04:12:24.243]  I don't know.
[04:12:24.263 --> 04:12:24.523]  Hold on.
[04:12:24.563 --> 04:12:29.968]  I think that the center thing... I don't travel with guns very often, so I don't know how to operate these.
[04:12:30.148 --> 04:12:32.690]  I'm gonna smash this son of a bitch up.
[04:12:33.130 --> 04:12:37.214]  Son of a bitch!
[04:12:37.874 --> 04:12:39.956]  Alright, goddammit!
[04:12:39.976 --> 04:12:41.878]  Look at that.
[04:12:41.898 --> 04:12:43.219]  It doesn't come like this in stores.
[04:12:44.179 --> 04:12:46.782]  I'm gonna kill the people that came up with this.
[04:12:46.802 --> 04:12:48.663]  Swap that into the studio.
[04:12:49.003 --> 04:12:49.524]  We're rolling.
[04:12:53.607 --> 04:12:54.687]  Don't kill me.
[04:12:54.707 --> 04:12:55.448]  All right, we're rolling.
[04:12:55.468 --> 04:12:56.668]  I don't think that plug should be there.
[04:12:57.308 --> 04:12:57.808]  Oh my God.
[04:12:57.828 --> 04:13:01.930]  I got a lot of points for you to get through there.
[04:13:01.950 --> 04:13:02.910]  Okay, that was amazing.
[04:13:02.950 --> 04:13:07.372]  This whiskey does not come with a hatchet to open it, or a blacklight, but if you... Does it come with a blacklight?
[04:13:07.452 --> 04:13:13.294]  No, but if you have one... But if you have a blacklight... By the way, I don't think I've ever sold a product on the air, but I'm proud to say that.
[04:13:13.314 --> 04:13:14.114]  We appreciate your support.
[04:13:14.154 --> 04:13:14.374]  I do!
[04:13:14.414 --> 04:13:15.434]  Come on, I'm totally all about it.
[04:13:19.289 --> 04:13:20.229]  What does that say?
[04:13:20.270 --> 04:13:21.290]  I'm going to let you read that.
[04:13:21.610 --> 04:13:24.131]  It says, uh, thus to tyrants, meaning death to tyrants.
[04:13:24.472 --> 04:13:26.172]  Yeah, I recognize that phrase.
[04:13:26.212 --> 04:13:27.533]  I think it was uttered in Ford's Theater.
[04:13:28.013 --> 04:13:28.613]  Thank you, brother.
[04:13:29.074 --> 04:13:29.854]  Well, enough of that.
[04:13:29.934 --> 04:13:31.935]  I didn't mean to turn it to Houston's Travaganza.
[04:13:32.295 --> 04:13:35.717]  The book is more important.
[04:13:35.897 --> 04:13:38.018]  The last topic I want to hit with you, I could go on for hours.
[04:13:39.158 --> 04:13:51.106]   We're trying to We're trying to get the audience of the social media app to believe that you can have longer content, because it was, you know, originally designed for very short, you know, brain droppings.
[04:13:51.206 --> 04:13:52.287]  Well, I think you've succeeded.
[04:13:52.307 --> 04:13:54.568]  The biggest English-speaking show ever.
[04:13:54.588 --> 04:13:57.309]  I mean, it's bigger than Jimmy Carson, bigger than Joe Rogan.
[04:13:57.349 --> 04:14:00.670]  Congratulations showing that freedom is successful.
[04:14:00.690 --> 04:14:01.110]  Well, thank you.
[04:14:01.130 --> 04:14:03.431]  Well, we're grateful that it's a... No, I'm grateful to you.
[04:14:03.451 --> 04:14:03.791]  You can say that.
[04:14:03.811 --> 04:14:04.651]  We have free speech.
[04:14:04.731 --> 04:14:06.752]  But anyway, here's my question.
[04:14:08.212 --> 04:14:17.859]  All of the trends that you describe, I think very credibly, and I'm a little bit surprised, but not at all ashamed to say I agree with pretty much everything that you've said, amazingly, but I do.
[04:14:18.319 --> 04:14:24.704]  And I think most reasonable people, if they just drop the kind of filter and stop lying to themselves and ask, like, where's the lie and what are you saying?
[04:14:24.764 --> 04:14:25.825]  I think we'll come to the same conclusion.
[04:14:26.445 --> 04:14:42.546]   But all of those trends are being forced to kind of ahead or they're going to come to fruition or something's going to happen in the next 13 months because we have a presidential election On the books, and you have this car crash, and I do not see how it's resolved.
[04:14:43.007 --> 04:14:43.287]  Do you?
[04:14:43.427 --> 04:14:44.328]  Like, what's going to happen?
[04:14:44.608 --> 04:14:46.410]  Again, it's the truth.
[04:14:46.530 --> 04:14:52.677]  Really, the only show I watch every day is yours when you have a new show, because I don't just agree with you, I learn stuff every time.
[04:14:53.238 --> 04:14:57.482]  And what you've been saying the last few months is dead on, and a lot of people agree with you, and I know I do.
[04:14:58.522 --> 04:15:02.843]  That you look at the trajectory of this, how they're escalating on Trump, whether you love him or hate him.
[04:15:03.104 --> 04:15:04.544]  He's now a populist icon.
[04:15:05.624 --> 04:15:06.665]  He's now the underdog.
[04:15:07.325 --> 04:15:08.725]  The globalists are coming after him.
[04:15:08.745 --> 04:15:10.606]  They're coming after our right to vote for who we want.
[04:15:10.926 --> 04:15:14.087]  He gets 60% against all... Which is the fundamental right of a democracy.
[04:15:14.868 --> 04:15:15.528]  The people rule.
[04:15:15.688 --> 04:15:17.328]  I can vote for whomever I want.
[04:15:17.388 --> 04:15:20.129]  And if you don't like that person, that's immaterial, right?
[04:15:20.169 --> 04:15:20.529]  Absolutely.
[04:15:20.750 --> 04:15:23.310]  And he's been indicted for saying they're stealing elections.
[04:15:23.591 --> 04:15:25.491]  They're stealing it trying to... Oh, I'm aware.
[04:15:26.131 --> 04:15:26.471]  Absolutely.
[04:15:26.531 --> 04:15:27.592]  And they're indictments of him!
[04:15:28.092 --> 04:15:29.753]  His election theft, but yes.
[04:15:31.615 --> 04:15:34.597]  But despite that, he's got 60% against all other Republicans.
[04:15:34.937 --> 04:15:36.698]  He's 15, 20 points ahead of Biden.
[04:15:37.279 --> 04:15:39.801]  It's backfired, but the deep state's not going to stop.
[04:15:39.821 --> 04:15:48.407]  So when you said to Trump several times in that 400 million views, whatever you got, biggest show ever, you said to him, well, is it the next thing that I'm trying to kill you?
[04:15:48.447 --> 04:15:51.369]  And he's so confident, he doesn't want to think about that.
[04:15:51.389 --> 04:15:53.090]  He doesn't want to think about it.
[04:15:53.190 --> 04:15:55.132]  Whereas I admire someone that's that confident.
[04:15:55.866 --> 04:15:58.666]  confident, the deep state does kill people.
[04:15:58.666 --> 04:16:02.545]  And that's their only next move because this is failing.
[04:16:02.545 --> 04:16:05.186]  And I think they're going to kill Biden too.
[04:16:05.186 --> 04:16:08.426]   Or I think they're going to try to, what you said in the speech again, before the
[04:16:08.426 --> 04:16:13.786]   last one I talked about like a month ago, you said, I don't see Biden and Trump
[04:16:13.786 --> 04:16:15.745]  being the candidates.
[04:16:15.842 --> 04:16:16.382]  What a pig he is!
[04:16:16.201 --> 04:16:19.801]   the system, the media going after Biden, and he deserves it, but they were covering it
[04:16:19.801 --> 04:16:21.420]  up until now.
[04:16:21.420 --> 04:16:22.601]  Now they're covering the laptop.
[04:16:22.601 --> 04:16:23.960]  Now they're covering attacking the dog.
[04:16:23.960 --> 04:16:28.281]   Now they're covering, you know, all of his senility, all the corruption, the Chinese
[04:16:28.281 --> 04:16:29.281]  spies.
[04:16:29.281 --> 04:16:30.281]  Attacking a dog.
[04:16:30.281 --> 04:16:31.281]  What a pig he is.
[04:16:31.281 --> 04:16:32.281]  I'm sorry.
[04:16:32.281 --> 04:16:36.801]   Well, I mean, I was told that by Secret Service and by people that, let's just say, work with
[04:16:36.801 --> 04:16:37.801]  them.
[04:16:37.801 --> 04:16:39.161]  And I'm going to leave it at that.
[04:16:39.217 --> 04:16:40.378]  I actually have a contact for you.
[04:16:40.398 --> 04:16:41.338]  You'll actually be able to hear it from them.
[04:16:41.398 --> 04:16:42.999]  When this is over, I'll let you actually hear it from yourself.
[04:16:43.260 --> 04:16:44.020]  I think they'll tell you off-record.
[04:16:44.040 --> 04:16:44.921]  I think they're willing to talk to you.
[04:16:45.621 --> 04:16:47.662]  But yeah, he is completely out of his mind.
[04:16:47.903 --> 04:16:52.406]  He wanders around for the entire two and a half years, it's getting worse, naked in the White House.
[04:16:53.446 --> 04:16:55.448]  Uh, in the middle of the night, doesn't know who he is.
[04:16:55.748 --> 04:16:58.950]  They have to give him a bunch of drugs, a bunch of amphetamines in the morning.
[04:16:59.250 --> 04:17:01.732]  Then they've got to drug him at night.
[04:17:01.792 --> 04:17:05.935]  Sometimes he's got to, though, he'll like be out for the morning for a while and then comes back out at night for a ball.
[04:17:06.235 --> 04:17:07.116]  That's when there's a real problem.
[04:17:07.136 --> 04:17:07.957]  He is on drugs.
[04:17:08.037 --> 04:17:08.877]  I have established that.
[04:17:09.057 --> 04:17:10.739]  I know someone who witnessed it.
[04:17:10.939 --> 04:17:11.879]  I'm not guessing at this.
[04:17:11.979 --> 04:17:16.923]  I know someone personally who witnessed him, uh, taking amphetamines.
[04:17:17.403 --> 04:17:18.684]  And this was, this was during the 2016 or 2020 election.
[04:17:21.266 --> 04:17:22.047]  So how's this going to go?
[04:17:22.067 --> 04:17:22.527]  That's huge.
[04:17:22.567 --> 04:17:23.568]  I know you don't play games.
[04:17:24.148 --> 04:17:24.909]  No, I don't play games.
[04:17:24.929 --> 04:17:26.690]  I'll just say he's a makeup artist.
[04:17:27.911 --> 04:17:29.652]  You said the NSA's spying on me.
[04:17:30.153 --> 04:17:30.553]  High level.
[04:17:30.573 --> 04:17:32.675]  And then a month later they went, yes, we're spying on Tucker Carlson.
[04:17:32.695 --> 04:17:33.355]  Yeah, I know.
[04:17:33.415 --> 04:17:34.736]  So you don't make stuff up.
[04:17:34.856 --> 04:17:38.779]  And so what I'm saying here is Biden's a liability for him.
[04:17:38.919 --> 04:17:39.800]  Trump's a liability.
[04:17:39.820 --> 04:17:40.320]  What do they do?
[04:17:40.360 --> 04:17:43.203]  They have a right winger they'll claim assassinated Biden.
[04:17:43.991 --> 04:17:48.471]   and they'll have a left-winger assassinate Trump. That then gets the country even in more of a fight
[04:17:48.471 --> 04:17:55.510]   against each other. And then they put in Gavin Newsom and somebody like Mike Pence or who knows.
[04:17:55.510 --> 04:17:59.670]   But I really think the next 13 months is the most critical time, not just in American history,
[04:17:59.670 --> 04:18:03.030]   but world history. Because if they can bring down America, they're going to bring down the world.
[04:18:03.030 --> 04:18:07.111]   Then you've got the escalation. Remember a year ago, Biden said, "You can't give F-16s
[04:18:07.111 --> 04:18:11.580]  and Abrams tanks and cruise missiles to the Ukrainians.
[04:18:11.580 --> 04:18:13.431]  That's World War III."
[04:18:13.431 --> 04:18:17.670]   Now they're doing it. So as Russia wins that war, as Colonel MacGregor documented a few months ago,
[04:18:17.670 --> 04:18:21.350]  NATO is escalating. Well, that leads right to nuclear war.
[04:18:21.350 --> 04:18:26.901]   So we're so close. That fundamentally makes me so mad. This transcends politics. Since when do
[04:18:26.901 --> 04:18:31.750]   Democrats love war? Since when do Democrats love the intelligence agencies? They love them now. And so
[04:18:31.750 --> 04:18:33.430]   really the Democratic- So dark.
[04:18:33.430 --> 04:18:38.070]   Just like the Republican Party is a beachhead for sanity and populism. It's not perfect,
[04:18:38.070 --> 04:18:39.350]  but it's a beachhead.
[04:18:39.504 --> 04:18:41.868]  The Democrat Party is totally turned over to evil.
[04:18:42.068 --> 04:18:43.470]  That's why I thought RFK Jr.
[04:18:43.490 --> 04:18:52.042]  was so refreshing, but they're shutting him out of the primary process, they're blocking him, and so now he's going to run third party, which will take away from Trump, most experts agree.
[04:18:52.302 --> 04:18:53.904]  I know Trump's people have looked at it and they think so.
[04:18:54.064 --> 04:18:54.405]  Of course.
[04:18:54.625 --> 04:18:55.747]  So that's very, very sad.
[04:18:57.305 --> 04:19:07.271]  So do, I mean, do you think, I mean, normally at this, you know, so we're in October, I guess, um, in the year before the election, you can sort of see the outlines pretty clear.
[04:19:07.291 --> 04:19:14.455]  I mean, in October of 1999, I was pretty confident it was going to be George W. Bush versus Al Gore.
[04:19:14.475 --> 04:19:22.400]  I mean, you sort of know ahead of time, but do you think that we're going to see on election day 2024, a ballot with Biden and Trump on it?
[04:19:24.568 --> 04:19:27.591]  I've been saying I think they may assassinate him or claim they had a heart attack.
[04:19:29.413 --> 04:19:35.640]  But I was thinking about each one individually, but I think when you said that a month ago, it was prescient, that that's the next move.
[04:19:36.280 --> 04:19:40.705]  If I get in their mind and I'm evil, I'm Machiavelli, that is what they have to do.
[04:19:40.825 --> 04:19:42.287]  But the election just forces the point.
[04:19:42.327 --> 04:19:47.932]   I mean, I guess I actually don't think that their preference is Well, that's what you're saying.
[04:19:47.952 --> 04:19:49.532]  All their tactics of covert aren't working.
[04:19:49.552 --> 04:19:51.993]  So as we saw with JFK in 1963 in Dallas, they will go over.
[04:19:51.813 --> 04:19:55.493]   rather than overt, but I just think, you know, there's an election on the books
[04:19:55.493 --> 04:19:58.612]   and like something's gonna happen. Well that's what you're saying. All their
[04:19:58.612 --> 04:20:03.692]   tactics of covert aren't working. So as we saw with JFK in 1963 in Dallas, they
[04:20:03.692 --> 04:20:07.972]   will go over. And so we have governors declaring emergencies to take the guns.
[04:20:07.972 --> 04:20:12.492]   All of that is, and it's suddenly Democrats are against sanctuary cities
[04:20:12.492 --> 04:20:16.813]   when they're the ones saying Governor Hochul and the mayor of New York,
[04:20:16.813 --> 04:20:20.012]  come here, come here.
[04:20:18.009 --> 04:20:19.671]  Now they're like, oh we never said come here!
[04:20:20.312 --> 04:20:31.457]   I think it's dawning on Democrats they've been betrayed, and maybe there's some point Where Democrats will have self-preservation, you know, the average voter, and say, no, we need to turn against this.
[04:20:31.497 --> 04:20:32.557]  This is totalitarian.
[04:20:32.917 --> 04:20:33.717]  This is dangerous.
[04:20:33.737 --> 04:20:34.298]  This is evil.
[04:20:34.978 --> 04:20:37.438]  But if that isn't the case, here's the problem.
[04:20:37.718 --> 04:20:42.499]  Even if Democrats wake up, the system will know that from their internal polls.
[04:20:43.099 --> 04:20:43.919]  The establishment will.
[04:20:43.939 --> 04:20:44.900]  They're going to make a big move.
[04:20:44.940 --> 04:20:46.620]  And is that a full-out war with Russia?
[04:20:46.920 --> 04:20:47.900]  A full-out war with China?
[04:20:48.480 --> 04:20:51.921]  Is it them allowing the jihadi sleeper cells?
[04:20:53.168 --> 04:20:57.572]  They're in America, that are pouring across our border, that are waiting to let them activate.
[04:20:57.913 --> 04:21:00.976]  And I'm not saying our government controls them, but they've let other governments bring them in.
[04:21:01.376 --> 04:21:02.817]  And they've given funding to those governments.
[04:21:03.718 --> 04:21:08.303]  And now if we don't see strong signals against Iran, I don't want war with Iran.
[04:21:08.323 --> 04:21:12.326]  What I'm saying is strong signals telling Iran, do not fund terror groups.
[04:21:13.143 --> 04:21:15.065]  And we don't see strong repudiation of Joe Biden.
[04:21:15.446 --> 04:21:20.051]  That will green light the security services to go ahead and let this new attack happen.
[04:21:20.432 --> 04:21:26.559]  And a massive jihadi attack in America could be the way to bring in martial law and cancel the election.
[04:21:27.360 --> 04:21:29.523]  Also, Klaus Schwab loves a telegraph, so does the UN.
[04:21:30.143 --> 04:21:30.943]  It is imminent.
[04:21:31.103 --> 04:21:36.744]  A cyber attack bringing down the power grid will make COVID look like absolutely nothing.
[04:21:36.764 --> 04:21:37.565]  It's basically his quote.
[04:21:38.045 --> 04:21:39.605]  I think I've got it almost exactly.
[04:21:40.825 --> 04:21:43.726]  And so, will they cut the power before the election?
[04:21:43.766 --> 04:21:46.046]  I mean, the sky is the limit.
[04:21:46.406 --> 04:21:47.347]  The sky is the limit.
[04:21:47.367 --> 04:22:06.199]   So people need to be vigilant and understand that we want to let the system know we're aware, we want to promote, The values of free speech, and of family, and of self-defense, and of local control, and of free market, rugged individualism, and a competitive civilization, and a colorblind society that Martin Luther King Jr.
[04:22:06.219 --> 04:22:06.619]  talked about.
[04:22:06.939 --> 04:22:19.170]   We need to go back to the things that made us great, that threatened the CCP, and threatened the globalists of the UN, because they're selling tyranny, and eating bugs, and being locked down in your houses, and forced injections, and Two men can have a baby.
[04:22:19.590 --> 04:22:23.774]  We're selling normal human biology and success and culture.
[04:22:24.134 --> 04:22:28.278]  And so I just think we have to give the alternate plan to their dystopia.
[04:22:28.778 --> 04:22:34.202]  We have to challenge their dystopia, but also give the alternate plan, which enough people aren't doing.
[04:22:34.283 --> 04:22:37.265]  But that's Trump's big sin is his optimism.
[04:22:37.325 --> 04:22:38.106]  America's great.
[04:22:38.606 --> 04:22:39.447]  Everybody's beautiful.
[04:22:39.727 --> 04:22:48.711]  We have such potential, and as soon as the world heard America was open for business, we saw trillions flood instantly in, because our leaders had said, America's not open for business.
[04:22:49.151 --> 04:22:56.615]  Invest in China and India and Mexico, where the globalists have middleman deals to get all the money and all the power, instead of the people getting it.
[04:22:57.435 --> 04:23:07.640]  It was Henry Ford, wasn't the perfect guy, but he said, the other auto manufacturers, this came out in federal documents and later antitrust suits, because he didn't get in trouble, they did.
[04:23:08.430 --> 04:23:14.413]  They said to him, the other auto manufacturers, they said, why are you going to pay your employees three times what we do?
[04:23:15.034 --> 04:23:18.836]  And he said, because I don't want just rich people buying my cars.
[04:23:19.376 --> 04:23:22.878]  I want my employees to prime the market, to buy it.
[04:23:22.998 --> 04:23:27.660]  They'll give me all the money back buying the Model T, and then that'll supercharge it.
[04:23:27.700 --> 04:23:28.901]  So that's the two different systems.
[04:23:29.341 --> 04:23:43.546]   Build this illustrious, incredibly exciting, roaring civilization of laissez-faire, Or let these big guys already made all the money, centralize control, shut us all down and vertically integrate so they're in control and then kill competition.
[04:23:44.027 --> 04:23:55.930]   So we have to kill the globalist program that's anti-free market, anti-capitalist, it's monopolistic, it's anti-human, it's a bunch of Last question, where will you be in five years?
[04:23:56.091 --> 04:23:57.972]  Are you going to stay in this country?
[04:23:58.292 --> 04:23:59.532]  Can you stay in this country?
[04:23:59.351 --> 04:24:05.190]   But that have decided we don't even get to take part in it while they take part in it and live like kings
[04:24:05.190 --> 04:24:09.581]  So it's us or them Tucker and we've got to crush the globalists.
[04:24:09.581 --> 04:24:14.341]   We've got to crush the New World Order We've got to challenge them or they're gonna destroy the
[04:24:14.341 --> 04:24:19.001]   planet. I believe that last question Where will you be in five years? You're gonna stay in this
[04:24:19.001 --> 04:24:21.690]  country. Can you stay in this country speaking of escalation?
[04:24:21.690 --> 04:24:28.151]   Again, I still never figured out what your crime is, but you have been persecuted for something
[04:24:28.550 --> 04:24:32.551]  in an escalating way.
[04:24:32.780 --> 04:24:33.860]  I got two subpoenas last week.
[04:24:34.840 --> 04:24:35.460]  Subpoenas?
[04:24:35.721 --> 04:24:40.381]  I got subpoenas on January 6th, again, on a criminal investigation.
[04:24:40.401 --> 04:24:41.662]  You didn't do anything on January 6th.
[04:24:41.682 --> 04:24:46.223]  And I got subpoenaed in Trump's criminal trial in Georgia.
[04:24:46.383 --> 04:24:46.883]  On what?
[04:24:47.403 --> 04:24:49.183]  And then my lawyer called and said, what is this?
[04:24:49.423 --> 04:24:55.848]   And they said, well, We don't just want him as a witness.
[04:24:56.108 --> 04:24:56.829]  He's a subject.
[04:24:57.949 --> 04:24:59.290]  I had nothing to do with Georgia.
[04:24:59.330 --> 04:25:00.851]  I'm not saying it's bad they went and challenged it.
[04:25:00.871 --> 04:25:01.411]  That's their right.
[04:25:01.831 --> 04:25:03.112]  I mean, I went and protested there.
[04:25:03.632 --> 04:25:05.093]  So it's just pure intimidation.
[04:25:05.153 --> 04:25:06.734]  So I have a problem.
[04:25:07.575 --> 04:25:08.795]  It's that I don't like to cut and run.
[04:25:09.376 --> 04:25:12.437]  I'm not the toughest guy around, but growing up, Dallas was pretty rough people.
[04:25:12.818 --> 04:25:14.098]  Some big guy started a fight with me.
[04:25:14.138 --> 04:25:15.219]  I just couldn't back off.
[04:25:15.996 --> 04:25:20.316]   And I almost always won those fights or went to the hospital trying.
[04:25:20.316 --> 04:25:22.675]  And so I decided to go down with the ship.
[04:25:22.675 --> 04:25:26.996]  I'm not going to leave the country.
[04:25:26.996 --> 04:25:29.697]  I'm not going to back down.
[04:25:29.697 --> 04:25:31.476]   And I'm going to continue to fight with everything I've got on me.
[04:25:31.436 --> 04:25:32.516]  I'll never sell out.
[04:25:32.556 --> 04:25:33.297]  I'll never give in.
[04:25:33.337 --> 04:25:33.998]  I could give out.
[04:25:34.258 --> 04:25:35.939]  That's why support is critical and word of mouth.
[04:25:36.339 --> 04:25:40.082]  Because Alex Jones is seen as a focal point, like catch the flag by the globalists.
[04:25:40.463 --> 04:25:42.604]  If they can shut me down, they believe they can shut anybody down.
[04:25:42.624 --> 04:25:43.145]  They've said that.
[04:25:43.745 --> 04:25:59.494]   And so it's human intelligence and human action and word of mouth TalkingAboutInfoWars.com, my show, what I do, is a test case, almost like Stalingrad in World War II, where all these forces of the globalists keep thinking, we beat this guy at this city, at this point, at this battle, we win.
[04:26:00.014 --> 04:26:02.095]  And so I don't think I'm even that important.
[04:26:02.576 --> 04:26:05.957]  I've just been chosen as this main battle point.
[04:26:06.198 --> 04:26:10.900]  So all these grassroots people and people like you and other great folks are supporting me through just supporting the First Amendment.
[04:26:11.360 --> 04:26:15.582]  And so I've got that backing, and that enrages the globalists.
[04:26:15.602 --> 04:26:21.266]  So the more they throw against me, the more support I get, and it's really become a historic battle.
[04:26:21.626 --> 04:26:30.831]  If I'm completely manned and demanned and shut down and can't operate, only then would I try to evacuate somewhere to try to keep my show on the air.
[04:26:30.911 --> 04:26:33.752]  But I've looked at it, and I don't even think that that's the case.
[04:26:34.233 --> 04:26:38.855]  Once they disrupt and shut down something, it's very hard to restart it.
[04:26:38.895 --> 04:27:02.005]   The good news is, There are so many other great talk show hosts, so many other great people that now understand this and even have perspectives better than mine, that I'm not obsolete yet, but thanks to you and thanks to Russell Brand, they're trying to now set up, and you know, Joe Rogan's come a long way, and Steve Bannon and countless other shows that I tune into that have high-level understanding and teach me a lot, and I'm in my heads of the game.
[04:27:02.526 --> 04:27:09.127]  So, you're our champion, Tucker, and there are other people, you know, lesser, I know you don't want to be the top dog, but you are, that's why you're under attack.
[04:27:10.060 --> 04:27:15.963]  Thanks to you, I know no matter what happens to me, men and women are going to continue the fight forward into the future.
[04:27:15.983 --> 04:27:17.284]  But this is an Alamo situation.
[04:27:17.804 --> 04:27:18.804]  I'm not evacuating.
[04:27:18.824 --> 04:27:19.985]  I'm not leaving.
[04:27:20.565 --> 04:27:21.126]  I'm not going.
[04:27:21.146 --> 04:27:22.186]  How'd they do with the Alamo?
[04:27:22.206 --> 04:27:22.606]  Do you remember?
[04:27:22.626 --> 04:27:23.327]  Everybody got killed.
[04:27:23.527 --> 04:27:23.827]  Oh, okay.
[04:27:25.185 --> 04:27:32.608]  But that example led to a big, you know, my mom's family raised Colonel Travis's son.
[04:27:33.188 --> 04:27:35.128]  And on my dad's side too, they were heavily involved.
[04:27:35.509 --> 04:27:38.690]  First Texas families, we have like Mexican land grants for our property.
[04:27:38.710 --> 04:27:39.670]  We still have Mexican land.
[04:27:39.690 --> 04:27:44.692]  We paid for 12 cents an acre, like 1825 in East Texas.
[04:27:44.832 --> 04:27:47.073]  So it's not as cool as your place, but it's pretty cool.
[04:27:48.253 --> 04:27:54.773]   And the last letter he wrote on that piece of wallpaper was to one of my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfathers
[04:27:54.773 --> 04:27:57.253]   in Gonzales, Texas, saying, "Please take care of my little boy."
[04:27:57.253 --> 04:28:04.253]   And so, but Travis knew he was going to die, but he was like, "I got 10,000 troops coming in on our 200-something.
[04:28:04.253 --> 04:28:08.802]   We're going to give them one hell of a fight and kill a bunch of them before they can get up north for the main
[04:28:08.802 --> 04:28:09.253]  battle."
[04:28:09.833 --> 04:28:14.315]  And they killed thousands, well 3,000 was estimated, if we go from memory, of Mexican troops.
[04:28:14.635 --> 04:28:19.177]  And so that'd be an honor to have like 10,000 troops coming at me and I'm in the Alamo.
[04:28:19.457 --> 04:28:21.718]  I don't have a death wish, but man, it gets me hot as a kite.
[04:28:22.819 --> 04:28:24.980]  And so I'm not doing what Colonel Travis did.
[04:28:25.000 --> 04:28:27.441]  The only reason they got beat is they ran out of ammo, basically.
[04:28:27.741 --> 04:28:29.542]  They had powder, but no more ball.
[04:28:30.022 --> 04:28:31.282]  And they were fighting with swords at the end.
[04:28:31.342 --> 04:28:34.344]  So those are tough men, and I don't even measure up to them.
[04:28:35.540 --> 04:28:36.620]  But I want to try to measure up.
[04:28:36.961 --> 04:28:38.441]  And so it's very exciting.
[04:28:38.681 --> 04:28:39.502]  It's instinctive.
[04:28:39.542 --> 04:28:43.323]  It's spiritual to be defending humanity and prosperity and freedom and justice.
[04:28:43.723 --> 04:28:47.745]  It's these globalist child trafficking monsters, the open border, all this evil.
[04:28:48.065 --> 04:28:50.306]  I mean, so my cells tell me to do this.
[04:28:50.406 --> 04:28:53.668]  My guts, my sinew say, you're ordered to do this.
[04:28:54.028 --> 04:28:55.188]  And I don't feel good unless I do it.
[04:28:55.569 --> 04:29:07.016]   And so the bigger the attacks get, it's the old World War II saying, when the planes were over the target, They didn't really have radar, but they knew the bases and the factories had flak, so they're shooting at them with artillery, anti-aircraft artillery, so you flew into that.
[04:29:07.356 --> 04:29:14.682]  And so me, the best place I want to be is in the flak, but I also hate the flak because we could blow up and we're not in the fight anymore.
[04:29:15.142 --> 04:29:22.228]  So there's that paradox, but 90% of me wants to be in the flak, 10% says maybe you should steer a little around it because you don't want to get knocked out.
[04:29:23.008 --> 04:29:29.030]  And until just a few years ago, I felt really bad because it didn't seem the paradigm had been shattered and people didn't actually read the Globalist documents.
[04:29:29.630 --> 04:29:32.991]  Now there's been a paradigm shattering and I'm almost obsolete, Tucker.
[04:29:33.511 --> 04:29:43.014]  And as soon as that happens, as soon as I see another couple hundred more prominent people that actually know what's going on, we've already reached the chain reaction point, I'm going to hang it up and disappear like Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[04:29:45.242 --> 04:29:45.762]  Alex Jones.
[04:29:46.162 --> 04:29:46.962]  Thank you, thank you.
[04:29:47.082 --> 04:29:47.963]  What a great conversation.
[04:29:47.983 --> 04:29:48.363]  Thank you, brother.
[04:29:48.383 --> 04:29:48.963]  I really appreciate it.
[04:29:48.983 --> 04:29:49.703]  Thanks for your courage, Tucker.
[04:29:49.723 --> 04:29:50.063]  Thank you.
[04:29:50.143 --> 04:29:50.843]  I love your crew.
[04:29:50.883 --> 04:29:51.423]  Great energy.
[04:29:51.743 --> 04:29:52.103]  Thank you.
[04:29:52.123 --> 04:29:52.944]  Americana, baby.
[04:29:53.724 --> 04:29:54.144]  Alex Jones.
[04:29:54.384 --> 04:29:56.344]  Both my grandfathers were in World War II.
[04:29:56.364 --> 04:29:59.105]  They never talked about what happened in World War II until after they died.
[04:29:59.004 --> 04:30:02.004]  and 39th male suicide of Jeffrey Epstein.
[04:30:02.004 --> 04:30:04.763]  (dramatic music)
[04:30:04.763 --> 04:30:07.523]  (dramatic music)
[04:30:07.523 --> 04:30:09.523]  Both my grandfathers were in World War II.
[04:30:09.523 --> 04:30:12.004]   They never talked about what happened in World War II until after they died.
[04:30:12.004 --> 04:30:14.125]  We got to dig into their stuff and see it.
[04:30:14.125 --> 04:30:16.523]  And my mom's dad was only on a few missions.
[04:30:16.529 --> 04:30:19.092]  Thank God he already got killed as a fighter pilot in World War II.
[04:30:19.753 --> 04:30:23.136]  And crash landed and broke a bunch of bones and he was out of the war.
[04:30:24.177 --> 04:30:26.619]  The other one did more missions than he was told to do.
[04:30:27.420 --> 04:30:29.802]  Out of North Africa and then in Italy and the whole thing.
[04:30:30.183 --> 04:30:33.366]  And then was there for four years and in Germany when it fell.
[04:30:34.625 --> 04:30:36.346]  And he told my dad a little bit about when he died.
[04:30:36.406 --> 04:30:38.828]  We got all his documents and all his medals and all his stuff.
[04:30:39.509 --> 04:30:42.311]  And man, the letters about, we see the flag.
[04:30:42.571 --> 04:30:43.512]  We're going into it.
[04:30:43.852 --> 04:30:44.653]  Those are the targets.
[04:30:44.993 --> 04:30:45.633]  We're going to hit it.
[04:30:46.314 --> 04:30:48.536]  You know, Billy, best buddy, just died.
[04:30:48.556 --> 04:30:49.536]  His plane just blew up.
[04:30:50.077 --> 04:30:52.439]  And man, there is something about that.
[04:30:52.819 --> 04:30:54.040]  Like we're going in.
[04:30:54.100 --> 04:30:55.861]  We're not running away from the attacks.
[04:30:56.141 --> 04:30:57.643]  We're flying into the attack.
[04:30:58.263 --> 04:31:02.145]  Because we got something to deliver and God said deliver it.
[04:31:02.406 --> 04:31:05.447]  And I'm going to deliver more payloads.
[04:31:06.208 --> 04:31:10.090]  The reason I volunteered for more missions is we have slayed the enemy.
[04:31:10.310 --> 04:31:11.631]  We have destroyed them.
[04:31:11.871 --> 04:31:13.072]  We have wrecked them.
[04:31:13.352 --> 04:31:15.534]  God has given me nothing but victory.
[04:31:16.414 --> 04:31:27.126]  And the idea now, when I've been given nothing but victory, that I won't continue the missions and I won't continue hammering them, but I can't do it without you.
[04:31:27.387 --> 04:31:29.069]  Where are you getting a better bang for the buck?
[04:31:29.269 --> 04:31:33.389]   So I tell you now, Nitric Boost became a best seller because Dr. Judy Mikovich talked about
[04:31:33.389 --> 04:31:34.668]  it and what a great product it is.
[04:31:34.668 --> 04:31:36.948]   She has nothing to do with it, but it's got all the ingredients she says, one of the best
[04:31:36.948 --> 04:31:40.188]   formulas she's seen to clean out your blood and empower your heart and brain and your
[04:31:40.188 --> 04:31:41.188]  arteries.
[04:31:41.188 --> 04:31:42.628]  Young, old, everybody should be on it.
[04:31:42.628 --> 04:31:46.349]   And now we even went to a bigger manufacturer, they got an even higher quality, stronger
[04:31:46.349 --> 04:31:51.748]   version that just came in today on the 18-wheeler and it is nitricboostinfowarsstore.com or
[04:31:51.748 --> 04:31:54.269]  888-253-3139.
[04:31:54.269 --> 04:31:55.269]  You need Nitric Boost.
[04:31:55.269 --> 04:31:56.269]  It's there.
[04:31:56.502 --> 04:31:57.523]  I wish we'd done a bigger run.
[04:31:57.643 --> 04:32:00.705]  Next Level Foundational Energy, methylfolate, all the B-Complex.
[04:32:00.805 --> 04:32:01.405]  It's available.
[04:32:01.625 --> 04:32:04.147]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[04:32:04.247 --> 04:32:08.889]  Get a signed copy that's a fundraiser of my book, The Great Awakening.
[04:32:09.130 --> 04:32:09.970]  I need your support.
[04:32:10.090 --> 04:32:10.751]  I'm thankful.
[04:32:10.871 --> 04:32:13.052]  And I want to thank all of you that got it and did support.
[04:32:13.072 --> 04:32:16.754]  But I'm really talking to the 99% of you, and it's way more than that now.
[04:32:16.874 --> 04:32:19.515]  That hear this show and never buy a damn thing.
[04:32:19.695 --> 04:32:20.755]  We're in the fight, folks.
[04:32:20.915 --> 04:32:27.176]  And I'll get in the damn airplane, and I'll start the engines, and I'll take off, and I'll fly over the enemy, and I'll drop the truth on their ass all day.
[04:32:27.236 --> 04:32:35.839]  But if I don't got bombs getting loaded, and jet fuel, or diesel, or kerosene getting put in the engines, I can't take the son of a bitch off, and I can't go do it.
[04:32:36.059 --> 04:32:43.680]  And we've already had, all glory to God, and at the level of God, but all support to you for your support, all credit to the audience.
[04:32:44.761 --> 04:32:47.573]   We've already I'll use the analogy.
[04:32:47.593 --> 04:32:52.600]  It's like we go to Las Vegas last 29 years on air, and we put a quarter in the slot machine, we win $1,000.
[04:32:53.621 --> 04:32:55.784]  We go play blackjack, we spend $1,000, we make $100,000.
[04:32:57.952 --> 04:32:59.493]  We go to the roulette wheel, we make a million.
[04:32:59.533 --> 04:33:00.794]  We never even lose!
[04:33:01.554 --> 04:33:05.457]  I get tortured, I get attacked, I get lied about, I get physically attacked.
[04:33:05.737 --> 04:33:08.959]  People come to my house, I don't even get into that, what that's like for my family.
[04:33:09.200 --> 04:33:19.586]  But as long as I don't care, and as long as I got courage and trust in God, like Job did, we have, for every attack, for every little slap I get, is a dagger in the enemy.
[04:33:19.927 --> 04:33:23.249]   For every time they thump me in the face, Is a fist right in their nose.
[04:33:23.449 --> 04:33:25.871]  For every time they break my leg, they get destroyed.
[04:33:26.091 --> 04:33:27.812]  One of their whole cities gets vaporized.
[04:33:28.092 --> 04:33:28.913]  Using that as an analogy.
[04:33:29.173 --> 04:33:31.134]  We are devastating them!
[04:33:31.394 --> 04:33:33.356]  This operation is a devastator!
[04:33:33.676 --> 04:33:34.857]  The enemy fears it!
[04:33:35.037 --> 04:33:35.717]  They hate it!
[04:33:35.877 --> 04:33:37.078]  They hate the spirit of it!
[04:33:37.238 --> 04:33:38.279]  They know it's real!
[04:33:38.799 --> 04:33:39.880]  It's everything they hate!
[04:33:40.600 --> 04:33:41.701]  So empower me!
[04:33:42.161 --> 04:33:42.982]  Energize me!
[04:33:43.242 --> 04:33:43.943]  Pray for me!
[04:33:44.263 --> 04:33:45.223]  Buy the products!
[04:33:45.904 --> 04:33:46.904]  Get off the fence!
[04:33:48.125 --> 04:33:48.886]  God's watching!
