[00:00:01.118 --> 00:00:06.899]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:21.121]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and support the InfoWars.
[00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:28.023]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWars and say, I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you wanna fight?
[00:00:28.263 --> 00:00:30.323]  You better believe you got one!
[00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:37.445]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:05.742]  Eighteen days ago, a would-be assassin managed to climb onto a roof 400 feet from the stage where the former president and leading presidential candidate Donald Trump was speaking.
[00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:12.211]  The assassin's bullet struck President Trump, narrowly missing a fatal blow thanks to a last-minute head turn.
[00:01:13.112 --> 00:01:15.793]  Tragically, not everyone was so fortunate.
[00:01:16.074 --> 00:01:20.376]  A beloved husband and father in the audience was killed, his life stolen in an instant.
[00:01:21.036 --> 00:01:24.278]  Two others remain seriously injured, their futures uncertain.
[00:01:24.998 --> 00:01:30.361]  The lives of law enforcement officers working the event and those in the audience have been forever changed.
[00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:39.447]  Yet the media has shamefully moved on to other stories, and Google has been caught trying to suppress iconic images of a bloody Donald Trump.
[00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:43.609]  Images showcasing the resolve of our nation in the face of the attack.
[00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.672]  But the American people have not forgotten, and we will not forget.
[00:01:48.473 --> 00:01:52.575]  There is no question that this was a monumental failure by the Secret Service.
[00:01:52.916 --> 00:01:54.797]  They had one job, and they failed.
[00:01:55.277 --> 00:01:55.878]  We know that.
[00:01:56.792 --> 00:02:05.560]  What remains unclear is who specifically failed, how they failed, and what must be done to ensure that something like this never happens again.
[00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:15.429]  America deserves to know that those responsible for this failure are, frankly, not going to be in charge of securing the upcoming Democrat National Convention.
[00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:21.554]  We need to know that someone's been placed on suspension, that someone won't be in charge of the next Donald Trump rally.
[00:02:22.435 --> 00:02:30.743]  Now, I was encouraged to hear that the Acting Director Rowe has initiated a disciplinary investigation in addition to the ongoing Secret Service policy review.
[00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:32.584]  This is an important step.
[00:02:33.145 --> 00:02:39.650]  However, real accountability will require a comprehensive examination of all the facts, which still remain unclear.
[00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:46.316]  This past Friday, my investigative team went to Pennsylvania to meet with local law enforcement and document the scene.
[00:02:47.057 --> 00:02:53.198]  One of the concerning things my team was told is that no one from Secret Service has talked to them since the shooting.
[00:02:54.419 --> 00:03:02.081]  I don't know how an investigation into what failed can be conducted without talking to the officers and agencies who were relied upon to do much of the work.
[00:03:02.841 --> 00:03:03.161]  It's Tuesday.
[00:03:03.181 --> 00:03:04.601]  Many questions remain unanswered.
[00:03:04.941 --> 00:03:05.721]  July 30th, 2024.
[00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:11.583]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the Embattled Studios in Central Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:03:12.523 --> 00:03:14.104]  Those ongoing hearings are happening right now.
[00:03:14.124 --> 00:03:15.284]  We'll have clips of that coming up.
[00:03:15.404 --> 00:03:17.325]  And look, Paul, they tried to shoot him.
[00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:18.366]  They did shoot Scalise.
[00:03:20.287 --> 00:03:24.568]  CNN, Paul Blitzer didn't even call the guy a bad guy.
[00:03:24.588 --> 00:03:27.070]  He called him a concerned citizen back when that happened.
[00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.811]  They broke, what, four of Paul's ribs, punctured his lung.
[00:03:31.632 --> 00:03:33.492]  He's been attacked many other times as well.
[00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:36.554]  So he's got skin in the game in this globalist
[00:03:38.237 --> 00:03:39.237]  We're good to go.
[00:04:03.348 --> 00:04:03.708]  I think so.
[00:04:24.062 --> 00:04:26.104]  Desecration of the Last Supper and more.
[00:04:26.324 --> 00:04:28.245]  I mean, these people are beyond disgusting.
[00:04:28.766 --> 00:04:32.269]  More is coming out about Kamala Harris' record that I knew about but had forgotten.
[00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.750]  This woman's been on our radar for 15, 20 years.
[00:04:35.571 --> 00:04:38.373]  It's just totally and completely insane.
[00:04:38.453 --> 00:04:40.775]  So, we're on hundreds of radio stations.
[00:04:41.176 --> 00:04:43.437]  Of course, we're at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:04:44.358 --> 00:04:54.160]  We're at band dot video and the number one place it's easiest to share real Alex Jones on X. Follow me there and share the live feeds because we've got a massive transmission lined up for you.
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.220]  We're going to break for one minute.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.861]  She went over 300 radio stations to carry the show and I'm going to plunge into all of it.
[00:05:00.981 --> 00:05:06.443]  Here today, but please take the links from Infowars.com forward slash show the live feed man dot video.
[00:05:06.603 --> 00:05:09.763]  And of course, real Alex Jones on X. Those are the coordinates to Liberty.
[00:05:10.003 --> 00:05:13.164]  Take action now, my Paul Revere's Venezuela.
[00:05:14.363 --> 00:05:20.407]  Was once the second most wealthy country in the Western Hemisphere.
[00:05:20.927 --> 00:05:24.750]  Was Argentina, Venezuela, and then the United States.
[00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.571]  Up until the 50s and the United States became number one in the world.
[00:05:28.432 --> 00:05:37.578]  And since then, Argentina, just a gorgeous, amazing country, and Venezuela have turned into literal hell holes.
[00:05:40.182 --> 00:05:46.083]  Look what happened in El Salvador, in Central America, turned around so quickly by Bukele in just three years.
[00:05:47.083 --> 00:05:47.824]  It's leadership.
[00:05:47.984 --> 00:05:50.244]  When you have corrupt kleptocrats, you implode.
[00:05:50.264 --> 00:05:53.325]  When you have good leaders, good people, you thrive.
[00:05:55.465 --> 00:06:04.867]  Latin America, dabbling in socialism and communism, went from an amazing place to a hellhole, just as America is as well.
[00:06:08.615 --> 00:06:10.496]  And that's what we're facing right now.
[00:06:11.177 --> 00:06:14.179]  Maduro, of course, replaced the dictator Hugo Chavez.
[00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:21.244]  They're the most corrupt voting system in the world, other than maybe the United States or places like Zimbabwe.
[00:06:23.246 --> 00:06:29.991]  And the State Department's openly saying that, yeah, it looks like he stole the election, but a lot of the same stuff that happened here in 2020 and 2022 was done there.
[00:06:35.063 --> 00:06:37.324]  I mean, look how un-self-aware Maduro is.
[00:06:37.364 --> 00:06:38.705]  Looks like a toddler.
[00:06:40.306 --> 00:06:42.187]  But that's, that's who these dictators are.
[00:06:43.388 --> 00:06:48.150]  And so, the polls were going completely, the exit polls, completely against Maduro.
[00:06:49.111 --> 00:06:53.453]  And so he just closed the polls early yesterday.
[00:06:54.234 --> 00:06:56.795]  And the country descended into civil war.
[00:06:56.815 --> 00:07:00.377]  And now hundreds of videos have come out.
[00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:03.119]  And
[00:07:05.168 --> 00:07:14.174]  They show, we're going to be going over those, that the police were first attacking people yesterday, but now they've been joining the crowds and have been retreating from government buildings.
[00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:17.897]  So, no cheers for Maduro.
[00:07:19.078 --> 00:07:25.843]  Nothing but people living under communism for three decades, rising up because there's nothing left to be redistributed.
[00:07:25.863 --> 00:07:34.369]  12, 13 years ago, they raided the zoos and ate the animals.
[00:07:35.322 --> 00:07:39.144]  There's no stray dogs or cats, reportedly, for at least five, six years.
[00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:44.387]  Thousands a day have been starving to death for over a decade, but the government passed a law you can't report on it.
[00:07:45.228 --> 00:07:47.409]  You don't see a lot of fat Venezuelans.
[00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.291]  Because it's like North Korea.
[00:07:53.533 --> 00:07:58.475]  And you've got the left running around defending Maduro right now.
[00:07:58.555 --> 00:08:02.578]  This is major foreshadowing for our election.
[00:08:04.195 --> 00:08:06.617]  Coming up in 97 days.
[00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:17.784]  And then you've got the 79 days of hell that I predicted four years ago that came true, and I'm predicting it'll be even more insane.
[00:08:18.745 --> 00:08:19.526]  So brace yourselves.
[00:08:19.546 --> 00:08:22.768]  We'll put on screen how many days of the election, and then the more important number
[00:08:24.226 --> 00:08:25.587]  That no one else is talking about.
[00:08:25.687 --> 00:08:28.068]  And again, I don't want to be the guy that's almost always right.
[00:08:28.088 --> 00:08:29.469]  I don't want to be the guy that's the vanguard.
[00:08:29.569 --> 00:08:30.990]  Because that means we're not going to win.
[00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:35.153]  But when Alex Jones becomes obsolete or passe or irrelevant, then we've won.
[00:08:36.614 --> 00:08:39.636]  97 days, 12 hours, 50 minutes, 8 seconds.
[00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:41.897]  The most important election in world history.
[00:08:41.937 --> 00:08:49.662]  But if you add the 79 days, you get the real number we've got to watch until Donald John Trump is inaugurated.
[00:08:50.402 --> 00:08:52.724]  And that's the really important number.
[00:08:55.464 --> 00:08:55.744]  Show!
[00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:06.850]  I like to cover what's coming next, so we're ready for it.
[00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.332]  173 days, 23 hours, 49 minutes, 37 seconds.
[00:09:11.793 --> 00:09:14.694]  That is to when the keys get handed back to the people.
[00:09:15.935 --> 00:09:24.780]  They know Kamala Harris is incredibly unpopular and only got 2% when she was running for president out of a field of more than 10 candidates.
[00:09:27.352 --> 00:09:33.173]  They know that she's not black, but they're all over the news with this new headline, White Dudes for Kamala.
[00:09:34.213 --> 00:09:35.493]  Kamala, however you say her name.
[00:09:36.474 --> 00:09:42.895]  And it's all these washed-up actors and people, including folks I like, like Jeff Bridges.
[00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:44.135]  There are a lot of people that know Jeff.
[00:09:45.115 --> 00:09:45.775]  He used to be a listener.
[00:09:45.815 --> 00:09:49.876]  I talked to him once, like a decade ago.
[00:09:49.896 --> 00:09:55.677]  And he's a really sweet person and a great actor, but he sounds like he's mentally retarded.
[00:09:56.824 --> 00:09:59.126]  Uh, in his latest endorsement of, uh, Kamala.
[00:09:59.146 --> 00:10:07.972]  And that's the word is Jeff, you know, his mind's not all there, but the cringe level of white dudes for Kamala.
[00:10:08.012 --> 00:10:14.096]  And then they're, they're literally up there saying you booty judge is saying booty juice is Biden calls him.
[00:10:15.197 --> 00:10:15.978]  They don't say beetle juice.
[00:10:15.998 --> 00:10:17.899]  You say booty juice, booty juice, booty juice.
[00:10:22.883 --> 00:10:25.925]  And they're all up there saying, if you don't,
[00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:29.872]  Vote for her, you're racist because you're white.
[00:10:29.912 --> 00:10:31.332]  Just admit you're evil because you're white.
[00:10:31.672 --> 00:10:35.494]  These are actors paid to say this by PR firms.
[00:10:36.814 --> 00:10:42.616]  And the idea that we care what Booty Juice says is a joke.
[00:10:43.916 --> 00:10:51.099]  They only got rid of Biden because they know he already stole it once, that you wouldn't buy, that no one would buy him stealing it again.
[00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:58.539]  And because on the trajectory of his mental decline, by election day, he won't even be able to talk.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.380]  And I've been saying that for a year.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.960]  He can barely talk now, he can barely walk now.
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.261]  He got off the plane in Austin yesterday with his video and he's like, huh?
[00:11:06.281 --> 00:11:07.322]  Like he didn't know where he is?
[00:11:08.942 --> 00:11:17.404]  He walks off the plane and they say, hey, Speaker Johnson says your plan to pack the Supreme Court's dead on arrival.
[00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:22.229]  He says he's dead on arrival and then stumbles off.
[00:11:22.309 --> 00:11:24.471]  I mean, this is just bizarro world.
[00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:29.235]  Yeah, back it up to when they open the door and he's just standing there like he doesn't know who he is.
[00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:30.256]  Back it up at the start.
[00:11:31.598 --> 00:11:34.881]  Guys, I guess this is the same video I had.
[00:11:36.202 --> 00:11:39.325]  I'll send you the one where he's like standing in the open door.
[00:11:39.986 --> 00:11:42.168]  Just type in Biden arrives in Austin.
[00:11:42.188 --> 00:11:43.269]  It was the top thing everywhere.
[00:11:45.052 --> 00:11:48.535]  I was going to pick my daughter up from camp yesterday, because I like to do that sometimes.
[00:11:48.655 --> 00:11:50.156]  My wife was happy to do it, but I was going to do it.
[00:11:51.537 --> 00:11:54.379]  And I'd kind of forgotten Biden was landing at like three o'clock.
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.623]  So I drive out of the parking lot of the office, and there's cops with the road blocked.
[00:12:01.925 --> 00:12:06.068]  And then I drive a couple miles to a side road, and they've got those blocks, so I drive around those.
[00:12:07.209 --> 00:12:11.192]  And they had roads, shoot, 15 miles from where Biden was going to be.
[00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:13.880]  Police over every overpass.
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.880]  People say, well, he's the president.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.321]  That's why.
[00:12:17.101 --> 00:12:23.665]  The point is, is they didn't give 1% support to Trump.
[00:12:23.705 --> 00:12:24.885]  You say, oh, he's the former president.
[00:12:24.945 --> 00:12:26.026]  He's the real president.
[00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:27.466]  He's the target.
[00:12:27.526 --> 00:12:28.347]  They tried to kill him.
[00:12:29.407 --> 00:12:31.548]  If anybody kills Biden, it's his internal staff.
[00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:33.329]  It'll be an inside job.
[00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.592]  But I'm OCDing now.
[00:12:40.132 --> 00:12:40.512]  It's okay.
[00:12:40.532 --> 00:12:41.013]  I'll find it.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.342]  He stands in the darkness of the door and starts going.
[00:12:46.243 --> 00:12:48.105]  And he's just standing there like not knowing what he's going to do.
[00:12:48.125 --> 00:12:48.785]  But I don't need it.
[00:12:48.825 --> 00:12:49.266]  It's fine.
[00:12:49.286 --> 00:12:50.146]  Anybody else can find it.
[00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:50.567]  We don't need it.
[00:12:50.907 --> 00:12:51.387]  No more Biden.
[00:12:53.349 --> 00:12:59.734]  So we have all of that news on the Biden front.
[00:13:01.115 --> 00:13:05.038]  Now, they had said that the campaign was only to do indoor deals.
[00:13:06.839 --> 00:13:11.623]  They had said that the
[00:13:16.533 --> 00:13:19.835]  Trump campaign had reportedly said he was only going to hold indoor rallies.
[00:13:19.855 --> 00:13:20.555]  I thought that was smart.
[00:13:21.636 --> 00:13:23.116]  Well, Trump overrode that now.
[00:13:24.337 --> 00:13:28.179]  Defiant Trump to hold rally at same place he was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:30.900]  And he said yesterday, I'm going to hold one in Butler.
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.001]  We thought, well, we hope it's indoors.
[00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:38.024]  No, he's going to go back to the same place and do it again.
[00:13:38.324 --> 00:13:42.806]  The man has ice water in his veins, nerves of steel.
[00:13:43.607 --> 00:13:43.867]  And look,
[00:13:45.928 --> 00:13:50.972]  I'd be willing to do it too and roll the dice, except he's going to win in a landslide.
[00:13:51.652 --> 00:13:52.793]  Too big to rig, I believe.
[00:13:52.813 --> 00:13:53.613]  The evidence is there.
[00:13:53.733 --> 00:13:54.594]  That's why they tried to kill him.
[00:13:55.475 --> 00:13:58.197]  Yeah, they can steal up to eight, nine points, depending on the study you look at.
[00:13:58.217 --> 00:13:59.457]  They've got that many dead people.
[00:14:00.058 --> 00:14:01.559]  So Trump's six, seven, eight, nine points ahead.
[00:14:01.599 --> 00:14:02.980]  They can probably steal it in battlegrounds.
[00:14:04.557 --> 00:14:09.099]  They can't steal it if he wins by 15-20 points, which he is, so they're gonna try to kill him.
[00:14:09.179 --> 00:14:11.600]  It's just simple arithmetic, folks.
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:17.162]  They already tried, but the Secret Service is blocking any investigation, not interviewing anybody, but there's a cover-up.
[00:14:18.403 --> 00:14:18.983]  It's a big deal.
[00:14:19.003 --> 00:14:23.925]  And that ties in to watch Biden tell reporter Speaker Johnson is dead on arrival.
[00:14:24.185 --> 00:14:25.046]  That clip's coming up.
[00:14:26.386 --> 00:14:30.548]  Exclusive Secret Service totally shuts down Texas Capitol for Biden visit.
[00:14:32.315 --> 00:14:33.756]  Held a three-hour meeting with local police.
[00:14:33.896 --> 00:14:37.338]  No meetings with local police in Butler, Pennsylvania for Trump.
[00:14:38.398 --> 00:14:39.219]  Bombshell interview.
[00:14:39.299 --> 00:14:43.141]  Trump rally SWAT team member never briefed by Secret Service.
[00:14:43.461 --> 00:14:44.361]  Says that none of them were briefed.
[00:14:46.002 --> 00:14:47.183]  That he's being threatened to shut up.
[00:14:47.223 --> 00:14:48.183]  That he's not going to shut up.
[00:14:49.164 --> 00:14:50.084]  That's all coming up.
[00:14:51.965 --> 00:14:53.646]  Got all the Venezuelan news, as I mentioned.
[00:14:53.666 --> 00:14:56.228]  A lot of stuff coming out about Kamala.
[00:14:57.148 --> 00:14:59.669]  Got a supercut of non-player characters.
[00:15:00.329 --> 00:15:01.209]  And I love Joe Rogan.
[00:15:01.249 --> 00:15:03.249]  He seems to always know everything I know and more.
[00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.370]  But a couple weeks ago, Joe had a guest on.
[00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.850]  He didn't know what an NPC was.
[00:15:07.951 --> 00:15:10.751]  So maybe I should... If Joe doesn't know, maybe a lot of the audience doesn't know what an NPC is.
[00:15:11.191 --> 00:15:13.312]  I'm not a big video game guy, but I know what an NPC is.
[00:15:13.352 --> 00:15:15.032]  Like when you're in these big online games.
[00:15:16.413 --> 00:15:18.393]  You have hundreds of thousands, you know, thousands of people playing.
[00:15:19.353 --> 00:15:20.074]  All at one time.
[00:15:21.214 --> 00:15:25.535]  But there's also non-player characters that the computer just runs that are in there.
[00:15:26.667 --> 00:15:27.948]  And they're just wandering around.
[00:15:29.849 --> 00:15:31.990]  You know, like a hooker in Grand Theft Auto or whatever.
[00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:33.810]  Or Fortnite or whatever.
[00:15:34.051 --> 00:15:36.051]  You know, I don't really play the games, but I read about them, I know about it.
[00:15:36.071 --> 00:15:38.733]  I'm an old-school video game guy myself.
[00:15:39.553 --> 00:15:42.755]  But... Absolutely.
[00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:49.838]  This is, uh... This is, uh, NPC... NPC stuff, big time.
[00:15:49.858 --> 00:15:54.040]  So we're gonna be talking some about that as well.
[00:15:55.976 --> 00:16:00.541]  NPC can stand for non-player character, which is a character in a game that is not controlled by a player.
[00:16:01.061 --> 00:16:06.647]  The term originated in tabletop role-playing games, where the game master or referee controls the characters in video games.
[00:16:07.007 --> 00:16:10.851]  NPCs are controlled by game's artificial intelligence, AI.
[00:16:10.951 --> 00:16:13.233]  NPCs should be neutral followers or adversaries.
[00:16:13.694 --> 00:16:16.436]  Their behavior can change depending on the player character's allegiance.
[00:16:16.937 --> 00:16:17.397]  For example,
[00:16:18.078 --> 00:16:18.498]  It goes on.
[00:16:18.878 --> 00:16:21.580]  Yeah, and the left really operate like NPCs.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.320]  They don't care if it goes against their own interests.
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.661]  They don't care if it's not true.
[00:16:25.001 --> 00:16:25.842]  They're not even thinking.
[00:16:25.882 --> 00:16:31.384]  They just receive the propaganda and they follow it.
[00:16:31.844 --> 00:16:34.105]  Well, you don't want to be an NPC.
[00:16:35.346 --> 00:16:39.728]  You want to have free will, but slaves of Satan are the original NPCs.
[00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.769]  All right.
[00:16:42.725 --> 00:16:46.007]  Let's go ahead and start our engines now and start plunging straight into it.
[00:16:46.027 --> 00:16:47.228]  I mentioned some of what's coming up.
[00:16:47.248 --> 00:17:06.722]  We also have accomplished and very well-known and incredible researcher and economist, as I said, Martin Armstrong of Armstrong Economics joining us on all the huge economic developments and world developments and paramilitary developments and everything else in the third hour today.
[00:17:06.742 --> 00:17:10.125]  I will open the phones up again today.
[00:17:11.806 --> 00:17:16.408]  Talk about Venezuela and what I believe is a foreshadowing of a very good chance.
[00:17:16.888 --> 00:17:18.849]  The Globalist Party said they're going to cause civil unrest.
[00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:20.890]  They're going to build a civil war.
[00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:28.813]  They've been hyping it everywhere in the news and their propaganda outlets with predictive programming and in fiction.
[00:17:30.014 --> 00:17:32.295]  All the movies about it, all the TV shows.
[00:17:33.856 --> 00:17:36.557]  So Maduro is an open dictator.
[00:17:36.577 --> 00:17:37.657]  He's been caught over and over again.
[00:17:37.677 --> 00:17:38.738]  He's wildly unpopular.
[00:17:39.861 --> 00:17:41.782]  They've done Gallup polls in Venezuela.
[00:17:41.883 --> 00:17:43.824]  It's like 75% of people don't like him.
[00:17:45.765 --> 00:17:52.250]  Even Hugo Chavez, who was popular early on, became a dictator and was known for stealing elections, the predecessor of Maduro.
[00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:56.133]  But now Maduro is in a lot of trouble.
[00:17:57.154 --> 00:18:03.979]  And again, they closed the polls early yesterday because Maduro was losing reportedly.
[00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.121]  He declared himself the winner.
[00:18:07.841 --> 00:18:11.943]  Kind of like Fox News declared Joe Biden the winner at 8 o'clock at night in Arizona.
[00:18:12.783 --> 00:18:14.904]  And so the people began hitting the streets.
[00:18:15.025 --> 00:18:15.905]  Roll it with audio.
[00:18:18.366 --> 00:18:20.787]  But let's also put the show headline up there for people.
[00:18:20.827 --> 00:18:21.708]  It's very, very important.
[00:18:23.305 --> 00:18:29.628]  But with audio, I want to play in a moment, clip 18, as they tear down all the posters of the image of the dictator.
[00:18:29.928 --> 00:18:33.210]  And again, normally, if you even spoke out against him, you'd get arrested or killed.
[00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:40.273]  But all over the country, they're pulling down his signs, they're taking over government buildings, they're burning government armored vehicles and tanks.
[00:18:41.093 --> 00:18:46.056]  I don't know how this is going to end, but I would say it looks like Maduro will not be able to hang on.
[00:18:46.116 --> 00:18:50.178]  The problem is, in the past, they just turned the electricity off and the water off until people
[00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:57.974]  So let's play a bunch of these clips back-to-back for TV viewers, for radio listeners.
[00:18:58.014 --> 00:18:58.834]  I'll narrate some of it.
[00:18:58.874 --> 00:18:59.415]  Start rolling them.
[00:19:32.205 --> 00:19:38.329]  So just common people all over the country, not just the capital of Caracas.
[00:19:47.115 --> 00:19:49.997]  So last night the police retreated, the military.
[00:19:51.098 --> 00:19:57.683]  Today they've been joining the pro-freedom demonstrators.
[00:19:59.232 --> 00:20:01.753]  So this is a good sign for Venezuela.
[00:20:01.773 --> 00:20:03.034]  I don't know if they'll be successful.
[00:20:05.175 --> 00:20:08.337]  But the biggest news is they have taken over the government buildings.
[00:20:08.857 --> 00:20:09.858]  Many of the government buildings.
[00:20:11.479 --> 00:20:12.239]  Including the palace.
[00:20:15.941 --> 00:20:17.522]  The main military base in the capital.
[00:20:23.085 --> 00:20:27.688]  So it looks to me like Maduro is probably
[00:20:29.025 --> 00:20:29.745]  On his way out.
[00:20:32.366 --> 00:20:32.906]  But we'll see.
[00:20:32.926 --> 00:20:35.247]  These communists have held on before.
[00:20:37.108 --> 00:20:40.809]  Protests erupted in Venezuela following dictator Maduro's victory.
[00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:44.730]  Protests in Venezuela.
[00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.631]  Opposition says it defeated Maduro.
[00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:53.541]  Anti-Maduro protests spread as Venezuelan opposition says he stole the vote, Reuters.
[00:20:54.381 --> 00:20:59.626]  Criticism mounts against Venezuela's Maduro and the electoral council that declared him a victor.
[00:20:59.646 --> 00:21:04.130]  Venezuela in turmoil as protesters dispute election results.
[00:21:05.271 --> 00:21:09.435]  Venezuela is wracked with protests and election uncertainty.
[00:21:11.757 --> 00:21:15.160]  Critics of Venezuela, Caracas, clash with National Guard.
[00:21:16.685 --> 00:21:17.726]  Venezuela 2024 election.
[00:21:17.746 --> 00:21:20.268]  Maduro tells Brazil he'll release voting records.
[00:21:20.328 --> 00:21:20.848]  Sure he will.
[00:21:21.649 --> 00:21:22.729]  And here's another big takeaway.
[00:21:22.769 --> 00:21:23.570]  We have video of this.
[00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:24.150]  It's in Spanish.
[00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:24.871]  We'll play it in a moment.
[00:21:26.372 --> 00:21:42.884]  He has now come out and said that Elon Musk is his nemesis and that Elon Musk is going to attack Venezuela with his rocket ships.
[00:21:43.919 --> 00:21:49.182]  Now, that sounds like the military understanding of a five-year-old.
[00:21:52.405 --> 00:22:00.750]  Non-military, load-carrying, heavy-lifting rockets are going to now attack Venezuela.
[00:22:01.791 --> 00:22:04.352]  And he looks like a five-year-old up there, waving his arms around.
[00:22:05.293 --> 00:22:10.877]  I guess that's how dumb he thinks his population is, or his supporters are, that Elon Musk is talking bad about me.
[00:22:11.769 --> 00:22:17.170]  Meanwhile, the Australian government is now saying they want to shut down Musk and Trump.
[00:22:18.311 --> 00:22:20.831]  So is the German government, the EU.
[00:22:21.531 --> 00:22:23.732]  I mean, these are just pathetic tyrants, folks.
[00:22:24.152 --> 00:22:26.973]  Elon Musk is tweeting mean things about me.
[00:22:28.713 --> 00:22:29.953]  Go ahead and roll this in Spanish.
[00:22:29.993 --> 00:22:30.374]  Here it is.
[00:22:31.334 --> 00:22:34.655]  Our new arch-enemy, the famous Elon Musk.
[00:22:42.136 --> 00:22:52.643]  Back at the start, I'm going to go ahead and read this.
[00:22:52.663 --> 00:22:53.523]  This is so ridiculous.
[00:22:53.944 --> 00:22:58.146]  He's coming to attack us with his rockets and his army.
[00:22:59.667 --> 00:23:01.248]  What, of people posting on X?
[00:23:01.288 --> 00:23:03.650]  I mean, see, ideas are bulletproof.
[00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:05.411]  No, it's not rocket ships.
[00:23:07.227 --> 00:23:11.589]  There's a great meme of Elon firing missiles at Venezuela.
[00:23:12.069 --> 00:23:13.250]  I mean, who buys this?
[00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:17.352]  Start it over, go ahead.
[00:23:17.432 --> 00:23:18.893]  And who controls virtual reality?
[00:23:20.713 --> 00:23:30.358]  Our new archenemy, the famous Elon Musk, who desperately shows his face and he would like to
[00:23:31.744 --> 00:23:34.905]  Come with his rockets and army to invade Venezuela.
[00:23:35.705 --> 00:23:39.566]  Elon Musk, thank goodness you showed your face because we know that you were behind this.
[00:23:39.967 --> 00:23:43.848]  Pull your money with your satellite.
[00:23:44.128 --> 00:23:49.630]  You intend to control the world.
[00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:52.330]  You already control Argentina.
[00:23:54.311 --> 00:23:56.092]  Lithium, Argentinian people.
[00:23:57.832 --> 00:23:59.673]  You already control Ecuador.
[00:23:59.693 --> 00:24:00.093]  Stop right there.
[00:24:01.667 --> 00:24:03.188]  He doesn't control those countries.
[00:24:03.708 --> 00:24:07.769]  He is trying to do deals with them to build things.
[00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:11.131]  Oh my gosh, he wants to come hire people and build things.
[00:24:12.551 --> 00:24:15.433]  He's gonna invade us with jobs and money.
[00:24:15.653 --> 00:24:16.313]  Here, go back to it.
[00:24:19.294 --> 00:24:22.495]  It is the representation of the fascist ideology in the world.
[00:24:23.956 --> 00:24:24.616]  Like having food?
[00:24:24.636 --> 00:24:28.858]  The economic power supporting the fascist ideology of extreme right.
[00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:42.221]  Anti-nature, anti-society, and now we have it as an archenemy of the peace of Venezuela.
[00:24:42.241 --> 00:24:47.923]  Today he took out an X. You did not see it.
[00:24:49.383 --> 00:24:50.203]  It is embarrassing.
[00:24:50.243 --> 00:24:55.045]  I'm not going to say it because it is embarrassing.
[00:24:55.145 --> 00:24:57.465]  He took out a Twitter that we
[00:24:59.468 --> 00:25:12.879]  Called before me some images of some people taking some things, some boxes, and it turns out that it was a video of some people taking some air conditioners.
[00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:13.440]  That's enough.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.442]  The point is, is that, yeah, the communists don't steal anything.
[00:25:16.782 --> 00:25:18.324]  They haven't killed hundreds of millions of people.
[00:25:22.407 --> 00:25:24.389]  And Musk joked back at him.
[00:25:25.603 --> 00:25:28.384]  And said, does Maduro have space lasers?
[00:25:28.464 --> 00:25:29.824]  Because I do!
[00:25:34.165 --> 00:25:34.726]  Oh my god.
[00:25:34.746 --> 00:25:37.386]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:25:37.706 --> 00:25:38.627]  I can't listen to Maduro anymore.
[00:25:38.667 --> 00:25:41.107]  He talks like he's got a lobotomy.
[00:25:43.808 --> 00:25:49.409]  And... He, again, is just an idiot.
[00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:50.430]  Overhead shot.
[00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.891]  Maduro's thugs are now cornered and retreating.
[00:25:53.911 --> 00:25:54.751]  I want to play that video.
[00:25:55.703 --> 00:25:59.146]  Could be a matter of hours before Maduro either flees or ends up dead.
[00:25:59.166 --> 00:26:03.869]  We've got all the images of people pulling down his signs everywhere.
[00:26:03.889 --> 00:26:04.850]  No support for him.
[00:26:06.351 --> 00:26:14.137]  And then we have, again, the ridiculous, hilarious post with Elon Musk.
[00:26:14.157 --> 00:26:14.557]  Here it is.
[00:26:15.077 --> 00:26:16.639]  We'll put this up on HD if we can find it.
[00:26:17.019 --> 00:26:19.561]  Elon Musk invading Venezuela with his rockets.
[00:26:23.417 --> 00:26:25.859]  2024 colorized like it's World War II.
[00:26:26.519 --> 00:26:28.101]  That is hilarious!
[00:26:31.704 --> 00:26:32.185]  I'm sorry.
[00:26:32.825 --> 00:26:34.006]  I need a good laugh sometimes.
[00:26:35.107 --> 00:26:36.609]  It's not funny for the people of Venezuela.
[00:26:36.989 --> 00:26:37.630]  I can tell you that.
[00:26:38.951 --> 00:26:39.712]  So here's what I want to do.
[00:26:41.073 --> 00:26:48.380]  I've got all this other news and all these other insane clips and insane stuff of Kamala and so much more, but I want to open the phone system up right now.
[00:26:50.162 --> 00:26:53.589]  For first-time callers, for callers that agree, disagree, long-time callers.
[00:26:55.072 --> 00:26:57.116]  Any subject you want to cover, happy to talk to you.
[00:26:57.136 --> 00:26:58.258]  Just have a clean phone line.
[00:26:58.278 --> 00:26:59.039]  We'll get you on air.
[00:27:00.413 --> 00:27:08.317]  So, start your engines, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[00:27:09.578 --> 00:27:12.779]  Where do you think this is going in Venezuela?
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.721]  What do you make of Trump saying he's going back to the very same place outdoors in Butler?
[00:27:17.262 --> 00:27:25.486]  Finally, we've got a bunch of Kamala news, we've got huge economic news, and we've got over 50% of liberal white women in major Gallup study are mentally ill.
[00:27:26.306 --> 00:27:29.248]  The highest statistic.
[00:27:29.268 --> 00:27:32.270]  50% of white liberals, women, are mentally ill.
[00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:33.891]  Actually, I think it's about 100%.
[00:27:34.232 --> 00:27:39.555]  So, there's the InfoWars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[00:27:39.715 --> 00:27:47.080]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's saw palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:49.322]  It affects the same type of tissues.
[00:27:49.702 --> 00:27:51.143]  ...that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[00:27:51.203 --> 00:27:52.464]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[00:27:52.484 --> 00:28:02.753]  You need to go to infowarsstore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWarsMD.
[00:28:02.773 --> 00:28:09.078]  877-789-2539 is its toll-free number to join us.
[00:28:09.098 --> 00:28:09.358]  877-789-2539.
[00:28:09.398 --> 00:28:12.541]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:28:12.641 --> 00:28:14.042]  Open phones throughout the transmission.
[00:28:16.344 --> 00:28:17.104]  Huge economist.
[00:28:17.385 --> 00:28:18.726]  Really incredibly accurate.
[00:28:19.755 --> 00:28:22.476]  We'll be joining us coming up in the third hour.
[00:28:26.976 --> 00:28:31.377]  But I want to go over some other news before I take your calls here.
[00:28:34.058 --> 00:28:36.178]  And talk about Kamala Harris.
[00:28:38.499 --> 00:28:39.899]  I've got some clips here.
[00:28:41.239 --> 00:28:42.180]  This one says it all.
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.000]  I reposted on Real Alex Jones.
[00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:50.031]  This is a supercut of non-player characters being programmed to say weird.
[00:28:51.871 --> 00:28:58.793]  There's countless videos like this where you can put together a hundred newscasts easily saying, you know, we know Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction.
[00:28:58.853 --> 00:28:59.573]  They all just repeat it.
[00:28:59.613 --> 00:29:04.654]  Or, we all know if you take the vaccine, you can't get COVID and you can't get sick and you can't spread it.
[00:29:06.295 --> 00:29:07.575]  We all know it's safe and effective.
[00:29:07.595 --> 00:29:08.555]  We all know it's safe and effective.
[00:29:08.575 --> 00:29:09.436]  We all know it's safe and effective.
[00:29:10.056 --> 00:29:15.337]  And they're giving a memo, this has come out, they admit it, to say Kamala Harris is not the Borders are.
[00:29:16.596 --> 00:29:25.620]  We can show you 50 clips or 100 clips or 1,000 if we want of them saying she is the border czar three years ago, now saying she was never the border czar.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:26.540]  It was made up.
[00:29:28.301 --> 00:29:33.943]  And they do this on every major subject over and over and over again.
[00:29:34.003 --> 00:29:44.527]  And this is a woman that not one person, not one person voted for in a primary.
[00:29:46.189 --> 00:29:50.271]  And they're calling the convention a primary now when the only vote you have is Kamala.
[00:29:53.553 --> 00:30:03.560]  So yeah, if you're a bunch of weird freaks that just, you know, want to be dysfunctional, people that are functional seem weird to you.
[00:30:05.161 --> 00:30:13.906]  It's weird that we want to be happy and stable and secure and involved and engaged and building a future, that we believe in a future.
[00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.771]  So here is the MPC Supercut.
[00:30:19.212 --> 00:30:23.275]  Some of what he and his running mate are saying, well it's just plain weird.
[00:30:26.294 --> 00:30:27.235]  These guys are just weird.
[00:30:27.335 --> 00:30:28.436]  That's what they are.
[00:30:28.516 --> 00:30:30.638]  As weird and creepy as J.D.
[00:30:30.698 --> 00:30:31.099]  Vance.
[00:30:31.499 --> 00:30:34.162]  Super weird idea from J.D.
[00:30:34.222 --> 00:30:34.502]  Vance.
[00:30:34.562 --> 00:30:35.043]  Yeah, it's not.
[00:30:35.063 --> 00:30:35.863]  I mean, it's quite weird.
[00:30:35.883 --> 00:30:37.004]  They're just plain weird.
[00:30:37.185 --> 00:30:38.526]  Just plain weird.
[00:30:38.686 --> 00:30:40.007]  Just plain weird.
[00:30:40.188 --> 00:30:41.148]  That stuff is weird.
[00:30:41.168 --> 00:30:43.531]  They come across weird and then they start being weird.
[00:30:43.551 --> 00:30:44.211]  Yeah, they're weird.
[00:30:44.251 --> 00:30:45.393]  Being a really weird.
[00:30:45.413 --> 00:30:46.374]  He's such a weirdo.
[00:30:46.574 --> 00:30:48.656]  Donald Trump and his weirdo running mate are weird.
[00:30:49.096 --> 00:30:50.297]  Deeply and profoundly weird.
[00:30:50.317 --> 00:30:51.438]  They are weird.
[00:30:51.458 --> 00:30:53.120]  These Republicans just being weird.
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:53.960]  It's just weird.
[00:30:54.241 --> 00:30:54.841]  It's really weird.
[00:30:54.881 --> 00:30:58.124]  Republican weirdness goes even deeper.
[00:30:58.144 --> 00:30:59.825]  He said a lot of things that are weird.
[00:30:59.845 --> 00:31:03.208]  The weird style that he brings, weird policies.
[00:31:03.248 --> 00:31:06.251]  Let's start with the weird thing, because it is a thing.
[00:31:06.271 --> 00:31:07.332]  Just plain weird.
[00:31:07.392 --> 00:31:10.234]  What was weird was talking about Diet Mountain Dew.
[00:31:10.274 --> 00:31:11.375]  Who drinks Diet Mountain Dew?
[00:31:11.395 --> 00:31:12.657]  Have you ever seen the guy laugh?
[00:31:13.497 --> 00:31:18.421]  That seems very weird to me that an adult can go through six and a half years of being in the public eye.
[00:31:18.721 --> 00:31:21.143]  If he has laughed, it's at someone, not with someone.
[00:31:21.504 --> 00:31:22.605]  That is weird behavior.
[00:31:22.625 --> 00:31:24.026]  Weird and cultish.
[00:31:24.126 --> 00:31:25.687]  These are weird people on the other side.
[00:31:25.707 --> 00:31:27.569]  He kind of doubled down on his weird ideas.
[00:31:27.589 --> 00:31:29.310]  I think weird is probably generous.
[00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.950]  Simply weird.
[00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:31.652]  These guys are just plain weird.
[00:31:31.732 --> 00:31:33.333]  Dance as weird.
[00:31:33.373 --> 00:31:34.314]  You know, as the campaigner.
[00:31:34.414 --> 00:31:35.095]  I don't think so.
[00:31:51.306 --> 00:31:54.408]  ...are just weird, in addition to being prejudiced and obnoxious.
[00:31:54.448 --> 00:31:56.849]  It's the weird part that's the most engaging.
[00:31:56.949 --> 00:32:00.951]  ...whom he addressed as, my beautiful Christians, which was super weird.
[00:32:01.011 --> 00:32:02.792]  Weird tech bro, J.D.
[00:32:02.872 --> 00:32:03.192]  Vance.
[00:32:03.232 --> 00:32:04.833]  He's a weird guy.
[00:32:04.933 --> 00:32:05.173]  J.D.
[00:32:05.273 --> 00:32:06.954]  Vance, uneasy and sort of weird.
[00:32:06.994 --> 00:32:09.495]  Frankly, for lack of a better word, that he's weird.
[00:32:09.555 --> 00:32:15.258]  ...sarcastic remarks that aren't even funny, and he kind of shows that he can't really deliver a one-liner.
[00:32:15.658 --> 00:32:20.980]  So Sam, weird is the word here in terms of initial impressions from Vance to the American public.
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.460]  Elon Musk said they should mix up the propaganda more.
[00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:24.621]  This is way too obvious.
[00:32:24.661 --> 00:32:29.742]  Just like when they were parroting before the debate that Biden was sharp as a tack.
[00:32:30.703 --> 00:32:32.263]  Well said, Elon Musk.
[00:32:33.263 --> 00:32:35.844]  And yeah, I'm all about Elon Musk right now.
[00:32:36.424 --> 00:32:37.705]  He judged a tree by its fruits.
[00:32:37.865 --> 00:32:40.346]  He is 100% in against the globalists now.
[00:32:41.146 --> 00:32:42.346]  Devastating them.
[00:32:42.366 --> 00:32:42.986]  That's the word.
[00:32:43.547 --> 00:32:44.587]  Annihilating them.
[00:32:46.061 --> 00:32:48.862]  And more and more prominent people are joining us worldwide against the globalists.
[00:32:49.203 --> 00:32:52.324]  We're turning the tide against the real weirdos.
[00:32:53.745 --> 00:32:54.285]  The Satanists.
[00:32:54.445 --> 00:32:54.926]  The losers.
[00:32:56.787 --> 00:32:58.808]  But there's a great meme here Robert Barnes put out.
[00:32:59.248 --> 00:32:59.728]  How J.D.
[00:32:59.848 --> 00:33:01.549]  Vance started his career as a Marine.
[00:33:01.849 --> 00:33:02.350]  Decorated.
[00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:04.030]  Highly decorated.
[00:33:04.671 --> 00:33:07.052]  How Kamala Harris started out her career as a prostitute.
[00:33:07.072 --> 00:33:08.273]  I'm not putting prostitutes down.
[00:33:08.313 --> 00:33:08.793]  It's just come on.
[00:33:11.274 --> 00:33:12.215]  So that's the reality.
[00:33:12.876 --> 00:33:14.157]  Of course, I love this meme.
[00:33:14.237 --> 00:33:19.422]  It says Plan A is the shooter in Pennsylvania and Butler to kill Trump.
[00:33:19.823 --> 00:33:21.124]  Plan B is Kamala.
[00:33:21.985 --> 00:33:29.112]  And if that doesn't work, Plan C is cheat, just like they did before.
[00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:45.597]  You know, Trump has won a lot of civil rights awards and things, but he's also been a big donor to the organizations that help get people with mental disabilities, Down syndromes, jobs and businesses, and even in some cases get them into limited management roles.
[00:33:46.638 --> 00:33:49.199]  And he's a very loving man.
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:54.142]  And I've said this, Trump to normal, common people is super sweet.
[00:33:54.162 --> 00:33:55.883]  He's really aggressive with other business people.
[00:33:57.551 --> 00:34:02.195]  But what was weird, again, was the blasphemy of the Last Supper.
[00:34:02.255 --> 00:34:04.756]  But again, Jill Biden has come out and defended that.
[00:34:04.776 --> 00:34:05.357]  It's good.
[00:34:05.737 --> 00:34:06.458]  We'll be covering that.
[00:34:06.638 --> 00:34:20.128]  But here's Trump just this year at a IAC event for disabled young people that have learned to take care of themselves, live alone, and have jobs.
[00:34:20.809 --> 00:34:23.130]  And here he is celebrating these folks with Down syndrome.
[00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:23.531]  Here's the video.
[00:34:52.525 --> 00:34:57.126]  Compare this video to the young black lady in Michigan that tried to shake his hand.
[00:34:57.146 --> 00:34:57.947]  He wouldn't even shake her hand.
[00:34:58.527 --> 00:34:58.747]  Biden.
[00:35:00.368 --> 00:35:01.528]  Biden, by the way, does not tip.
[00:35:01.548 --> 00:35:02.328]  He introduced Hillary.
[00:35:02.408 --> 00:35:03.429]  Trump tips huge.
[00:35:04.689 --> 00:35:05.830]  $100 bills just for Dorman.
[00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:10.331]  A lot of people that know Trump, he's just so nice.
[00:35:12.052 --> 00:35:13.713]  Again, this is a story he never told.
[00:35:13.733 --> 00:35:15.733]  A lot of people that saw it and it's come out now.
[00:35:16.814 --> 00:35:19.655]  About 20 years ago, Trump's limousine broke down in New York.
[00:35:21.283 --> 00:35:26.887]  And a black truck driver pulled over, because for some reason the spare was flat, and helped fix their tire.
[00:35:27.627 --> 00:35:30.289]  And Trump said, give me your name, give me your number, give me your info.
[00:35:30.949 --> 00:35:38.254]  And a month later, it came in the mail that his multi-hundred-thousand-dollar mortgage was paid off.
[00:35:39.935 --> 00:35:40.855]  That's what Trump does.
[00:35:42.916 --> 00:35:49.781]  And, I mean, I get, you know, the Lord works mysterious ways.
[00:35:50.762 --> 00:35:52.324]  Well, Trump works in weird ways.
[00:35:52.604 --> 00:35:56.169]  And you would think of that as like, well, why do you do that?
[00:35:56.229 --> 00:35:57.691]  Well, that's just how Trump operates.
[00:35:58.832 --> 00:36:04.640]  And he will totally work tirelessly in some business deal against other rich people to dominate them and beat them.
[00:36:06.155 --> 00:36:07.476]  But common people is not like that.
[00:36:08.196 --> 00:36:23.863]  That's how he could get construction jobs done in New York in places that nobody could, because you do basic stuff like go into the union and say, hey, cut this out and cook them all T-bone steaks and give them all 500 bucks and hang out with them and give them baseball tickets.
[00:36:23.883 --> 00:36:25.184]  You can say, well, he's patronizing them.
[00:36:25.484 --> 00:36:25.964]  Well, guess what?
[00:36:26.044 --> 00:36:27.825]  Nobody else gave him a pat on that back.
[00:36:28.966 --> 00:36:30.746]  Nobody else they worked for ever treated him like that.
[00:36:30.767 --> 00:36:33.608]  They never had the boss come and actually be nice to them.
[00:36:35.077 --> 00:36:36.799]  So yeah, Trump knows how to get stuff done.
[00:36:38.261 --> 00:36:39.082]  I even got on him once.
[00:36:39.122 --> 00:36:40.284]  I've told the story probably 20 times.
[00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:41.926]  It was like serious stuff's going on.
[00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:43.287]  He calls up my wife.
[00:36:43.307 --> 00:36:45.570]  We're in Hawaii getting married eight years ago, my second wife.
[00:36:46.271 --> 00:36:47.973]  He goes, hey Alex, hey blah blah blah, can I talk to your wife?
[00:36:48.033 --> 00:36:49.275]  I said, sure, Mr. President.
[00:36:49.916 --> 00:36:51.618]  And he starts telling her how great I am for like 10 minutes.
[00:36:51.638 --> 00:36:52.820]  I actually grabbed the phone away.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.563]  I was like, sir, you're very nice to do that, but you understand Fiona Hill works for Jordan Soros.
[00:36:56.583 --> 00:36:57.223]  You gotta get rid of her.
[00:36:57.423 --> 00:36:57.924]  Which he did.
[00:36:57.944 --> 00:36:59.365]  Like, I know, Alex.
[00:36:59.565 --> 00:37:00.165]  I just called.
[00:37:00.185 --> 00:37:01.146]  I'm glad you're married.
[00:37:01.186 --> 00:37:02.768]  It's very important.
[00:37:02.828 --> 00:37:03.888]  Women are incredible.
[00:37:03.908 --> 00:37:05.049]  Your wife's an incredible keeper.
[00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:05.770]  She's a special one.
[00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:08.632]  And I said, I know you're doing this to honor me, and I appreciate it.
[00:37:08.672 --> 00:37:11.234]  Can I just... He said, Alex, I gotta go.
[00:37:11.434 --> 00:37:11.795]  Click.
[00:37:13.756 --> 00:37:16.658]  But, I mean, it's how Trump operates.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.541]  Because he wasn't calling up to talk politics.
[00:37:20.582 --> 00:37:22.083]  He was calling up to say congratulations.
[00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:24.891]  And that's how it works.
[00:37:25.632 --> 00:37:27.653]  So yeah, I guess to the left, that is weird.
[00:37:28.153 --> 00:37:36.958]  In fact, I even said to Roger Stone back in the time, I said, I know Trump spends like eight hours a day calling people, but that's what he did to get businesses back to America.
[00:37:38.279 --> 00:37:43.342]  He would call up these world leaders and say, hey, you're gonna get rid of those tariffs on our machines into France.
[00:37:44.763 --> 00:37:46.104]  Washers, dryers was the case.
[00:37:47.945 --> 00:37:52.188]  We called like dozens of countries just for a few companies that decided to move back.
[00:37:53.168 --> 00:37:54.209]  But we're getting blocked in Europe.
[00:37:54.229 --> 00:37:58.113]  So he spent hours and hours calling world leaders, and it came out later in the news.
[00:37:58.133 --> 00:37:58.894]  Trump's talked about it.
[00:37:59.875 --> 00:38:05.780]  He told Macron, Macron said, no, I'm not going to take those tariffs off your appliances.
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.763]  He said, OK, we're putting a 100 percent tariff on all your wine.
[00:38:09.204 --> 00:38:12.947]  Macron called back in less than three minutes and said the tariffs are off.
[00:38:14.268 --> 00:38:16.511]  It's no one's been standing up for us.
[00:38:16.531 --> 00:38:17.592]  And that's what Trump talked about.
[00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:28.299]  And why the Communist Chinese didn't like him but then actually respected him because he went over there and he got all the numbers and he went, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:38:28.539 --> 00:38:37.282]  The Chinese are getting 25% of the money and we're getting like 30% as consumers, as sellers.
[00:38:38.163 --> 00:38:43.985]  And when Trump found out that over 40% of the money was going to middlemen,
[00:38:45.759 --> 00:38:54.445]  Who had set up communist China and set up the deals over there that they were just getting the majority of the money because they made the deal with dictators 40 years ago.
[00:38:55.586 --> 00:38:57.828]  Trump said, those deals are over.
[00:38:58.588 --> 00:39:04.513]  He said to China, you're going to work out a deal where you get half the profit and we get half the profit.
[00:39:05.333 --> 00:39:09.236]  And the corporations even made more money under that system because the economy exploded.
[00:39:09.756 --> 00:39:13.179]  But that's how Trump is very transactional, very pragmatic.
[00:39:14.557 --> 00:39:19.681]  And if Trump tells you something, even if you disagree with it, you can bet that's what it's going to be tomorrow and the next week.
[00:39:20.621 --> 00:39:22.082]  It's his strength and his weakness.
[00:39:22.482 --> 00:39:29.908]  He is so pig-headed, like a donkey, that once he decides something, you're not going to convince him.
[00:39:29.948 --> 00:39:31.228]  You're not going to turn him around.
[00:39:31.609 --> 00:39:32.810]  You're not going to back him off.
[00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.491]  It's like, boom, a bull's coming at you.
[00:39:36.792 --> 00:39:37.913]  And it's great when you agree with him.
[00:39:37.953 --> 00:39:39.074]  It's not good when you disagree.
[00:39:42.836 --> 00:39:45.358]  So, this is a Tuesday emergency broadcast.
[00:39:45.378 --> 00:39:46.779]  Venezuela descends into anarchy.
[00:39:46.839 --> 00:39:49.460]  Civil war as dictator Maduro fights for control.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:55.844]  Alex Jones, yours truly, breaks down how the events of Venezuela foreshadow what's happening in America in 97 days.
[00:39:57.085 --> 00:39:57.806]  What could be happening.
[00:39:59.487 --> 00:40:04.010]  Alright, I'm going to start going to the loaded phones here in a few minutes.
[00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:06.691]  Right to the next hour, interspersed with all this other news.
[00:40:06.711 --> 00:40:10.494]  A lot of stuff about Kamala coming out that I've seen with Hillary as well.
[00:40:10.554 --> 00:40:11.214]  It's a similar thing.
[00:40:11.234 --> 00:40:12.015]  This is all confirmed.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:20.242]  But before we go any further, without getting any inside baseball and strategy, I've always shot you straight, okay?
[00:40:20.882 --> 00:40:24.123]  Infowars will survive if you support us.
[00:40:26.343 --> 00:40:39.467]  And where it looks like we'll be on the air through the election, cross your fingers, except that the saboteurs that were in here from the federal government under the bankruptcy court, not the judge, but the people that he fired, crippled this place.
[00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:43.712]  Financially, where, okay, we're still in the air, but the money's gone.
[00:40:44.733 --> 00:40:55.020]  And so we need to bring in sponsors to bring in extra money to then buy the supplements of the bigger seller to then continue on and operate.
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.081]  And that's just part of it.
[00:40:56.101 --> 00:40:58.602]  It would take an hour to describe it all, and the enemy's watching.
[00:40:58.642 --> 00:41:00.384]  I don't want to give out inside baseball.
[00:41:00.884 --> 00:41:04.927]  And I knew it was coming, and I learned this morning some insane stuff that'll be major national news.
[00:41:05.587 --> 00:41:11.229]  When I strategically bring it out, but just the enemy hit again and it's crazy, but we've got God on our side.
[00:41:11.249 --> 00:41:12.830]  So I'm just going to trust God.
[00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:14.671]  I'm in total ease about this and move forward.
[00:41:15.751 --> 00:41:19.633]  But you taking action is the other half of the equation.
[00:41:19.653 --> 00:41:21.534]  So you're really, you decide whether we stay on air.
[00:41:21.634 --> 00:41:22.934]  So you, these are great supplements.
[00:41:23.014 --> 00:41:23.775]  Infowars MD.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.941]  We're sold out of Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:41:27.341 --> 00:41:29.582]  We learned who actually we were buying the product from.
[00:41:29.883 --> 00:41:31.623]  The only other company that had 95% curcuminoid.
[00:41:31.884 --> 00:41:38.507]  When you get InfoWars MD Turmeric 95, you get 95% curcuminoid concentrate.
[00:41:38.747 --> 00:41:42.249]  You take raw turmeric pills, they give you joint relief and things, they're 4%.
[00:41:42.609 --> 00:41:43.470]  This is the strongest, 95%.
[00:41:44.991 --> 00:41:47.872]  Turmeric 95, InfoWars MD.
[00:41:49.253 --> 00:41:51.014]  The InfoWars MD line are amazing.
[00:41:53.590 --> 00:42:02.434]  And the great part is, our stuff's all selling out, but we started two years ago with who was supplying us, or our manufacturers, we learned, is a listener.
[00:42:02.854 --> 00:42:10.077]  And so, you get even a lower price, and it supports the broadcast, and they basically have an unlimited supply.
[00:42:11.397 --> 00:42:12.978]  Just because it drops ships from their facility.
[00:42:12.998 --> 00:42:14.719]  Your order comes in, it drops ships, it comes to you.
[00:42:15.703 --> 00:42:18.605]  Or goes through a couple days later and shipped out even the same day sometimes.
[00:42:38.946 --> 00:42:44.189]  As a backup, because it just came through, and I learned that this big owner of a big company was a listener, so we made this deal.
[00:42:44.249 --> 00:42:45.109]  I never really promoted it.
[00:42:45.189 --> 00:42:46.710]  Well, luckily, it's sitting there waiting.
[00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:52.073]  Gosh, we've gone to gummies, the pain relief, the full spectrum CBD.
[00:42:54.034 --> 00:42:58.197]  Check it all out at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsMD.
[00:42:58.797 --> 00:43:00.418]  All right, now, the next thing.
[00:43:00.438 --> 00:43:01.558]  I'm going to play this report.
[00:43:01.618 --> 00:43:02.359]  Come back with your calls.
[00:43:04.244 --> 00:43:14.871]  There is a great organization, and they don't mind if I say who they are, but I'll get into that at a later show, I'll probably have most guests, that are one of the biggest sponsors of a whole bunch of the top conservative talk show hosts you see.
[00:43:15.271 --> 00:43:25.097]  And they're great people, and they're patriots, and they own a knife factory in Arkansas, veteran-owned, and they're amazing folks, and it's the highest quality steel.
[00:43:26.538 --> 00:43:29.320]  They're on the dagger line for me, but this was already their best-selling knife.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.481]  They've done a limited edition just for us, only 500.
[00:43:33.331 --> 00:43:34.813]  It costs over 100 bucks to make this knife.
[00:43:35.393 --> 00:43:35.734]  There's only 500.
[00:43:35.954 --> 00:43:37.095]  It's a limited edition.
[00:43:37.155 --> 00:43:39.598]  It's etched with Trump, the fight, fight, fight fist.
[00:43:40.239 --> 00:43:42.902]  On the other side, it's my signature and the American flag.
[00:43:43.142 --> 00:43:43.703]  There's 500 of these.
[00:43:45.439 --> 00:43:54.744]  Right now, and I think this will probably sell out in 48 hours, and they're going to have some other offerings, but this is going to get InfoWars back on its feet, and you get a historical memento.
[00:43:55.425 --> 00:43:57.746]  Please, if you have the funds, this is something you need.
[00:43:57.766 --> 00:43:59.527]  This is the highest end knife you can get.
[00:43:59.807 --> 00:44:00.448]  It's a breacher.
[00:44:00.808 --> 00:44:01.988]  The military uses these.
[00:44:02.529 --> 00:44:03.649]  This is a limited edition.
[00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:07.191]  Get it right now at DMO.
[00:44:08.752 --> 00:44:09.493]  DMO.
[00:44:09.873 --> 00:44:13.095]  Just DMOKnives.com.
[00:44:13.155 --> 00:44:13.475]  Here it is.
[00:44:16.451 --> 00:44:24.535]  Hi, this is Jeff with DMO Knives and we are super excited to partner with Alex Jones for this style breacher knife from DMO.
[00:44:24.735 --> 00:44:30.418]  For a limited time, our tactical breacher through our Alex Jones partnership will be designed like this.
[00:44:30.738 --> 00:44:39.962]  We have our black over OD Cerakote, OD G10 composite handles with the following logos upon them.
[00:44:40.062 --> 00:44:43.704]  Betsy Ross flag over here with Alex Jones signature here.
[00:44:44.524 --> 00:44:47.186]  And then you flip that over, and we've got Donald Trump.
[00:44:47.587 --> 00:44:48.307]  Fight, fight, fight!
[00:44:48.828 --> 00:44:53.571]  We've had these things crammed in a Humvee, prying open a door in Syria.
[00:44:54.292 --> 00:44:55.453]  We've shot them at the range.
[00:44:55.973 --> 00:44:56.994]  They have survived.
[00:44:57.014 --> 00:44:58.896]  They have a lifetime guarantee.
[00:44:59.816 --> 00:45:01.938]  So if you ever break one, we'll replace it for you.
[00:45:02.278 --> 00:45:10.245]  To help develop the toughness and sturdy and durable and usability, along with the beauty,
[00:45:11.025 --> 00:45:20.654]  There's four different heat stages that we put this thing through to come up with a dual level of hardness for usability and sturdiness.
[00:45:20.875 --> 00:45:22.777]  It's built to never fail the operator.
[00:45:23.537 --> 00:45:26.640]  Made in America, by Americans, for Americans.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:32.645]  How much stronger can you get than the DMO quarter-inch thick steel breacher?
[00:45:33.145 --> 00:45:36.028]  Patriotic, strong, just like America.
[00:45:36.368 --> 00:45:45.916]  Again, we are super excited to team up with Alex Jones with DMO knives for this product, which is our patriotic tactical breacher.
[00:45:46.477 --> 00:45:48.118]  You can't get more patriotic than this.
[00:45:48.399 --> 00:45:49.680]  We can't wait to get them in your hands.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:54.223]  In the last six months, InfoWars has been fighting for its very existence.
[00:45:54.243 --> 00:45:58.105]  We've had a lot of great organizations and groups reach out wanting to support us.
[00:45:58.706 --> 00:46:01.348]  Well, I gotta tell you, Dead Moose Ops is one of the best.
[00:46:01.908 --> 00:46:10.974]  They put out some of the most amazing collectible limited edition knives and other amazing collectibles with folks like the Hodge Twins and so many others.
[00:46:11.514 --> 00:46:19.320]  These guys are bringing great products to the American people and they're keeping some of the most important talk show hosts on the air as we win the fight against the globalists.
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:19.540]  So,
[00:46:20.881 --> 00:46:30.792]  We've decided to come out with 500 of their best-selling limited-edition knives engraved specifically for InfoWars.
[00:46:32.117 --> 00:46:32.718]  It's amazing.
[00:46:33.118 --> 00:46:39.382]  So here it is with the American flag, the original 13, Alex Jones, and it is such a storied knife.
[00:46:39.742 --> 00:46:41.864]  It's a special operations style knife.
[00:46:41.924 --> 00:46:45.826]  It's of the highest quality steel made right here in America, in Arkansas.
[00:46:46.267 --> 00:46:54.992]  This knife cost over $115 to just produce because it's of the highest quality materials at the highest standards.
[00:46:55.012 --> 00:46:55.593]  And there's only
[00:46:56.853 --> 00:47:08.838]  500 of these limited inscription knives with the original 13 colonies flag, commissioned by George Washington, and laser inscribed with my signature, Alex Jones.
[00:47:09.098 --> 00:47:10.999]  This is a very important fundraiser.
[00:47:11.439 --> 00:47:16.441]  You know, on NPR and on PBS, you know, they get hundreds of millions of dollars in tax money every year.
[00:47:16.782 --> 00:47:19.883]  They will sell a coffee mug for $100 that'll cost $5.
[00:47:20.983 --> 00:47:24.985]  And you know you're getting memento to know you supported communism and evil and the New World Order.
[00:47:25.645 --> 00:47:30.468]  Well, this is a knife that cost over $115 because it's such high quality.
[00:47:30.728 --> 00:47:37.072]  And when you get the knife and you pay the extra money to fund the operation, you are changing the world.
[00:47:37.852 --> 00:47:44.796]  So if you want a limited edition knife that is simply amazing, read all about it right now at dmonives.com.
[00:47:45.416 --> 00:47:47.758]  It is dmonives.com.
[00:47:48.298 --> 00:47:49.999]  This is a true piece of Americana.
[00:47:50.699 --> 00:47:52.040]  And it funds the operation.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:58.942]  There's only 500 of this knife available, so please be part of this fundraiser and have this piece of history.
[00:47:59.242 --> 00:48:11.326]  Go to DMO, that's Dead Move Operatives, but just DMO, the letters DMO, knives.com, it's on screen, and you get an additional $25 off when you use promo code ALEX.
[00:48:13.553 --> 00:48:14.934]  It takes money to win a war.
[00:48:15.735 --> 00:48:17.077]  They have hit us with so much.
[00:48:17.437 --> 00:48:18.158]  And we are bloodied.
[00:48:18.298 --> 00:48:18.958]  We are wounded.
[00:48:19.459 --> 00:48:20.200]  We're not giving up.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.902]  We cannot fight the enemy without you.
[00:48:23.423 --> 00:48:25.265]  All of this is going to keep us on air.
[00:48:25.965 --> 00:48:28.888]  All of this, one way or another, even if they shut us down, I'll be right back.
[00:48:29.609 --> 00:48:31.731]  But it takes funds to fight a war, people.
[00:48:32.091 --> 00:48:33.132]  They just tried to kill Trump.
[00:48:33.913 --> 00:48:35.334]  I'm not going to tell you what they've been doing to me.
[00:48:38.117 --> 00:48:39.638]  I know this means they're going for broke.
[00:48:39.718 --> 00:48:40.799]  I mean, they're going for everything.
[00:48:41.159 --> 00:48:49.045]  So when I'm getting attacked savagely by the CIA, the FBI, the Justice Department, I know that they're not doing that because they don't like me.
[00:48:49.125 --> 00:48:49.986]  I mean, they hate my guts.
[00:48:50.026 --> 00:48:52.948]  They're doing it because they're coming for us.
[00:48:53.869 --> 00:48:54.529]  And don't worry.
[00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:56.491]  Stuff's going to get a lot worse.
[00:48:56.571 --> 00:48:57.692]  I'll be even more vindicated.
[00:48:58.072 --> 00:48:59.473]  I wish we could put the brakes on this.
[00:48:59.533 --> 00:49:00.094]  We're trying.
[00:49:00.574 --> 00:49:01.495]  Got a real shot at it.
[00:49:02.095 --> 00:49:06.839]  But lordy, lordy, if you think you've seen some tyranny, my sweethearts,
[00:49:07.964 --> 00:49:11.789]  My beautiful patrons, as Trump would say, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:14.271]  You've seen nothing.
[00:49:15.553 --> 00:49:17.675]  And feel good knowing this.
[00:49:18.456 --> 00:49:22.181]  Trump and myself and his family
[00:49:24.182 --> 00:49:27.945]  And Elon Musk and a few others are at the very tip of the spear.
[00:49:28.005 --> 00:49:29.426]  So we're canaries of the coal mine.
[00:49:29.446 --> 00:49:30.246]  You see what's going on.
[00:49:30.927 --> 00:49:32.148]  We're happy warriors.
[00:49:32.668 --> 00:49:33.669]  I'm right where I want to be.
[00:49:33.689 --> 00:49:34.770]  I always wanted to be a man.
[00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:36.551]  I've always wanted to have courage.
[00:49:36.691 --> 00:49:37.772]  I've had courage my whole life.
[00:49:38.572 --> 00:49:39.413]  It's instantaneous.
[00:49:39.533 --> 00:49:40.093]  It's unlimited.
[00:49:41.134 --> 00:49:43.516]  But I have a fear of failure because these people are evil.
[00:49:44.338 --> 00:49:45.538]  So I'll never back down.
[00:49:45.658 --> 00:49:46.339]  I'll never give up.
[00:49:46.519 --> 00:49:51.080]  It's impossible for me to sell out, but I could give out and I cannot do without your support.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:57.622]  DMONIVES.COM 25% $25 off promo code Alex and it is top of the line knife.
[00:49:57.662 --> 00:50:05.424]  We'll come out with some also quality made American knives that are less expensive, but we wanted to go with their very best right up front.
[00:50:05.464 --> 00:50:11.966]  This is going to be historic limited edition DMONIVES.COM promo code Alex for discount.
[00:50:12.467 --> 00:50:13.487]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:50:14.582 --> 00:50:18.263]  And again, all the great products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:50:18.363 --> 00:50:19.403]  And we're selling out of everything.
[00:50:19.663 --> 00:50:23.544]  The X2, the X3, the DNA Force, the Fish Rolls almost sold out.
[00:50:23.604 --> 00:50:24.344]  And then we're out of money.
[00:50:24.764 --> 00:50:26.644]  So I've got to bring these sponsors on who are great.
[00:50:26.664 --> 00:50:27.405]  We're getting you the best.
[00:50:27.425 --> 00:50:30.165]  You know, you'll hear a sponsor each day for a few minutes.
[00:50:30.845 --> 00:50:32.306]  And that's how we're going to keep fighting.
[00:50:33.026 --> 00:50:37.767]  With the satellite uplinks, the hundreds of radio stations, and the crew, and the legal, and you know, all this.
[00:50:37.787 --> 00:50:39.627]  But it's a war.
[00:50:40.307 --> 00:50:41.408]  And they've already come to me.
[00:50:41.428 --> 00:50:42.568]  You know, I've talked about it.
[00:50:42.608 --> 00:50:43.368]  They didn't even hide it.
[00:50:44.284 --> 00:50:48.647]  They told me three years ago when I was in Connecticut right before, you know, all this, and they wanted a mediation.
[00:50:48.667 --> 00:50:50.047]  And I said, hey, we're like the Godfather.
[00:50:50.067 --> 00:50:50.628]  We're going to win.
[00:50:51.268 --> 00:50:51.828]  We're going to get you.
[00:50:51.848 --> 00:50:53.469]  Why don't you just sell out?
[00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.990]  And I said, what do you want?
[00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:55.711]  I wanted to see what they'd say.
[00:50:55.751 --> 00:50:57.972]  They said, well, we'll start with not defending the Second Amendment.
[00:50:59.333 --> 00:51:00.453]  I said, I want to see what they'd say.
[00:51:00.473 --> 00:51:01.374]  They said, well, give me some more.
[00:51:01.394 --> 00:51:01.834]  What else do you want?
[00:51:01.854 --> 00:51:02.815]  I said, we'll give you a list of things.
[00:51:02.875 --> 00:51:04.736]  I said, yeah, I knew there'd be a list of things.
[00:51:05.096 --> 00:51:07.657]  I won't do the Second Amendment thing, and I won't do anything you want.
[00:51:08.038 --> 00:51:08.758]  They said, OK, great.
[00:51:08.918 --> 00:51:09.459]  You're going to lose.
[00:51:10.856 --> 00:51:13.458]  You're gonna lose in the end, doesn't matter what you do to me.
[00:51:13.819 --> 00:51:15.801]  My integrity, in fact, I'll let the enemy know.
[00:51:16.201 --> 00:51:19.104]  I enjoy, it's not sick, it's how God made me.
[00:51:19.384 --> 00:51:21.846]  I'm not a masochist, I don't like pain, except I do like this pain.
[00:51:22.227 --> 00:51:22.827]  It means I'm winning.
[00:51:23.428 --> 00:51:26.771]  So, it is so valuable to me that I've been persecuted.
[00:51:27.111 --> 00:51:30.094]  It is so valuable that I persevered, thanks to God and my family.
[00:51:30.374 --> 00:51:33.217]  I'm so proud of my family that's been persecuted, standing with me, and this crew.
[00:51:33.437 --> 00:51:34.478]  So proud of you!
[00:51:34.498 --> 00:51:36.400]  I'm damn proud.
[00:51:37.788 --> 00:51:43.352]  Not in a prideful way, but happy, satisfied, content.
[00:51:44.013 --> 00:51:45.394]  I feel like I'm a good person.
[00:51:45.414 --> 00:51:46.815]  I feel like God loves me.
[00:51:46.855 --> 00:51:47.835]  I can feel God's love.
[00:51:47.855 --> 00:51:49.937]  Pride's not even a word.
[00:51:50.217 --> 00:51:51.598]  It's just like I'm where I'm supposed to be.
[00:51:52.399 --> 00:51:55.421]  And I love the career, what they've been through, and just everybody.
[00:51:55.441 --> 00:51:58.203]  And they stuck with me, and you've stuck with us, so I thank you all.
[00:51:59.624 --> 00:52:00.544]  All right, we're gonna go to break.
[00:52:01.562 --> 00:52:07.525]  And we're going to come back on the other side, and we're going to take your calls and cover all the news and so much more today.
[00:52:07.545 --> 00:52:09.886]  Hour number two, three, and four.
[00:52:10.466 --> 00:52:13.828]  Huge guests coming up and more straight ahead.
[00:52:13.908 --> 00:52:16.289]  Please stay with us and spread the word because you are Paul Reveres.
[00:52:17.029 --> 00:52:17.389]  Follow me on.
[00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:18.690]  Exit with Alex Jones.
[00:52:20.171 --> 00:52:25.333]  This is a make it or break it moment, so I need people to connect those synapses in their brain for you to make a decision.
[00:52:26.493 --> 00:52:29.555]  If you don't support InfoWars, we will be shut down.
[00:52:30.742 --> 00:52:32.423]  And people say, well, they're constantly trying to shut you down.
[00:52:32.463 --> 00:52:33.223]  How are you still on the air?
[00:52:33.363 --> 00:52:33.643]  God.
[00:52:34.683 --> 00:52:35.764]  But God works through people.
[00:52:37.264 --> 00:52:42.586]  So, we're in a paradox here where the judge says we're open for three more months.
[00:52:44.266 --> 00:52:48.748]  If we're able to get a buyer out of the law, they won't be able to shut us down.
[00:52:48.768 --> 00:52:49.668]  I'll just work with somebody else.
[00:52:50.588 --> 00:52:51.088]  And that's coming.
[00:52:51.108 --> 00:52:51.809]  That's got to be set up.
[00:52:52.989 --> 00:52:58.511]  But in the meantime, if people believe the news that we're being shut down everywhere, which they tried to do and failed,
[00:53:00.151 --> 00:53:02.172]  By that foregone conclusion, we're shut down.
[00:53:02.292 --> 00:53:13.640]  And under the last federal bankruptcy manager who would not reorder product and killed all our advertising, who was positioning us to be shut down and tried to shut us down, we caught him.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:14.941]  The judge caught him and fired him.
[00:53:16.442 --> 00:53:17.902]  We're almost sold out of all the products.
[00:53:18.743 --> 00:53:19.003]  All right?
[00:53:19.784 --> 00:53:22.525]  But we have a lot of great products that are still in stock.
[00:53:23.026 --> 00:53:23.766]  Limited supplies.
[00:53:23.826 --> 00:53:27.068]  So I need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:53:27.288 --> 00:53:28.349]  And we just had a donation button.
[00:53:28.369 --> 00:53:29.110]  Maybe we should just do that.
[00:53:29.864 --> 00:53:32.607]  You're fighting for freedom in a key election, battling the globalists.
[00:53:32.647 --> 00:53:33.288]  We need support.
[00:53:34.029 --> 00:53:35.591]  But we want a long-term relationship with you.
[00:53:35.611 --> 00:53:37.573]  We want you to be symbiotic.
[00:53:37.593 --> 00:53:45.102]  We want you to get great products you like and deliver to you quickly and enjoy them and have them empower you and make your life better so you love them and you keep getting them.
[00:53:45.122 --> 00:53:46.043]  We want a relationship.
[00:53:46.992 --> 00:53:52.754]  So there's the InfoWars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[00:53:53.494 --> 00:54:00.857]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's saw palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[00:54:01.237 --> 00:54:05.198]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[00:54:05.258 --> 00:54:06.519]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[00:54:07.239 --> 00:54:17.904]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWars MD.
[00:54:18.284 --> 00:54:19.845]  We've got Ashwagandha Gummi.
[00:54:20.445 --> 00:54:23.767]  Relaxes you, makes you feel really relaxed with no downer feeling.
[00:54:24.607 --> 00:54:25.007]  Amazing.
[00:54:25.828 --> 00:54:26.688]  An incredible product.
[00:54:27.768 --> 00:54:28.609]  Goodnight Sleep.
[00:54:29.009 --> 00:54:30.110]  We have a lot of great sleep aids.
[00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:30.810]  This one's excellent.
[00:54:30.830 --> 00:54:31.970]  They're all different formulas.
[00:54:32.191 --> 00:54:32.731]  People love it.
[00:54:32.871 --> 00:54:33.651]  Goodnight Sleep.
[00:54:34.331 --> 00:54:35.052]  InfoWars MD.
[00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:42.055]  Ashwagandha with black pepper, which relaxes you and makes you lose weight.
[00:54:42.813 --> 00:54:43.754]  These are all concentrates.
[00:54:44.174 --> 00:54:45.095]  Joint Relief Max.
[00:54:45.275 --> 00:54:46.075]  Works really well.
[00:54:46.556 --> 00:54:47.436]  Great pain relief.
[00:54:47.596 --> 00:54:48.457]  Huge bottle of it.
[00:54:48.797 --> 00:54:49.398]  Jam-packed.
[00:54:49.858 --> 00:54:50.398]  It's there.
[00:54:50.919 --> 00:54:51.839]  Joint Relief Max.
[00:54:52.259 --> 00:54:53.300]  InfoWars MD.
[00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:54.441]  Prostate Support.
[00:54:54.461 --> 00:54:55.181]  Already mentioned that.
[00:54:55.802 --> 00:54:57.103]  This is just the top formula.
[00:54:57.123 --> 00:54:57.923]  Super high quality.
[00:54:58.304 --> 00:54:58.704]  Organic.
[00:54:59.284 --> 00:55:00.245]  Nerve Renew.
[00:55:00.825 --> 00:55:01.266]  Amazing.
[00:55:01.566 --> 00:55:04.048]  To get your nerves not to kill pain, but to get your nerves healthy.
[00:55:04.228 --> 00:55:04.948]  Nitric Boost.
[00:55:05.128 --> 00:55:05.829]  Vitamin Refusion.
[00:55:05.849 --> 00:55:06.549]  About to sell out.
[00:55:06.729 --> 00:55:07.390]  About to sell out.
[00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:08.310]  Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:55:08.511 --> 00:55:10.692]  And something I never talk about and should talk about more.
[00:55:10.772 --> 00:55:11.933]  Probiotic Fiber.
[00:55:13.053 --> 00:55:13.834]  One life!
[00:55:14.114 --> 00:55:22.338]  And I'm gonna fight tyranny.
[00:55:23.299 --> 00:55:27.301]  I've been doing it for 30 plus years and I'm 50 and I'm just hitting my prime.
[00:55:30.102 --> 00:55:35.365]  But I couldn't do it without you, so I want to thank you again for keeping me in the fight!
[00:55:37.185 --> 00:55:39.146]  And I'll never give up my will!
[00:55:39.266 --> 00:55:41.227]  I'll never give up my sovereignty!
[00:55:41.627 --> 00:55:43.108]  I'll never submit!
[00:55:44.288 --> 00:55:48.230]  And I'm getting stronger, and so are you, while the enemy's getting weaker!
[00:55:50.211 --> 00:55:55.874]  That which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger, as Friedrich Nietzsche said, and he's absolutely true.
[00:55:57.635 --> 00:56:04.418]  Just like they say in Apocalypse Now, the very start of the movie, pull up the start of the movie if you can, where, uh,
[00:56:05.609 --> 00:56:14.916]  Martin Sheen is talking to himself and he's in there and he says, he says, while I'm in here getting weaker, Charlie's out there in the jungle getting stronger.
[00:56:16.757 --> 00:56:24.043]  So while you persecute me, you make me stronger, while you, the New World Order, get weaker.
[00:56:24.063 --> 00:56:29.247]  All right, huge amounts of notes, massive information to cover this hour.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:35.062]  And a huge, massive, incredibly informative guest.
[00:56:35.082 --> 00:56:39.445]  I'm going to give you his website because his predictions are dead on.
[00:56:39.505 --> 00:56:44.428]  Martin Armstrong, Armstrong Economics, ask-socrates.com, coming up.
[00:56:44.968 --> 00:56:48.490]  But let's take a ton of your calls and cover news in this hour.
[00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:49.951]  Some stations don't carry this segment.
[00:56:49.971 --> 00:56:50.771]  A lot do.
[00:56:51.431 --> 00:56:54.293]  We'll take a one-minute break, come up in a few minutes, but let's get one caller in right now.
[00:56:54.433 --> 00:56:57.575]  RoboDiscotech in Maryland on Venezuela.
[00:56:58.908 --> 00:57:00.008]  And immigration to the U.S.
[00:57:00.028 --> 00:57:01.028]  and what's happening down there.
[00:57:01.248 --> 00:57:03.089]  And Maduro could be removed.
[00:57:03.309 --> 00:57:05.549]  We're not sure yet, but the country's in civil war.
[00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.969]  Go ahead.
[00:57:07.189 --> 00:57:09.490]  Yeah, well, good afternoon, Alex.
[00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:11.130]  Let me just think about this.
[00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:12.870]  Reverse Trojan horse.
[00:57:13.771 --> 00:57:17.071]  Everyone used the phrase, military-age men.
[00:57:17.391 --> 00:57:19.952]  And as we know, they always give things away.
[00:57:20.932 --> 00:57:27.553]  If I were to plan a revolution in a country, I would just import all of these people to train them.
[00:57:28.641 --> 00:57:46.669]  I would ready battalions as they came over the southern border, and then they would just, as we happen to increase all of the deportations back to Venezuela in the last several months, ship them en masse all back, looking like they were nothing more but immigrants being returned from the United States.
[00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:51.231]  And then you think about how many Chinese military aids meant.
[00:57:51.934 --> 00:57:53.876]  So, is that the next shoe to drop?
[00:57:53.996 --> 00:58:04.144]  Well, I mean, there's no doubt that we've got millions of military men here, and the globalists have been bringing them, and the Iranians are the main group that have been organizing them for paramilitary attacks if there's a major attack on Iran.
[00:58:04.164 --> 00:58:06.966]  I would see it as the Iranians, not the Venezuelans.
[00:58:07.787 --> 00:58:11.169]  The Venezuelan communists can barely wipe their asses, they're so corrupt and stupid.
[00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:15.673]  But I'm not poo-pooing what you're saying, I'm saying the Iranian threat is a documented real thing.
[00:58:17.768 --> 00:58:24.393]  How about the United States actually importing the Venezuelans to train them and send them back?
[00:58:24.553 --> 00:58:25.293]  No, no, I heard that.
[00:58:25.333 --> 00:58:30.817]  And there's a real case point of that to promote tyranny and create a criminal network for narcotics trafficking with the CIA.
[00:58:31.218 --> 00:58:36.501]  That, of course, is MS-13 out of El Salvador sent up there in the early 90s.
[00:58:37.162 --> 00:58:40.804]  And then the Clintons ship hundreds of thousands of them back and then they take over the country.
[00:58:40.844 --> 00:58:42.786]  So there is a precedent for what you're saying.
[00:58:44.315 --> 00:58:45.437]  How about, I have one more thing.
[00:58:46.218 --> 00:58:47.921]  This is more along the lines of COVID.
[00:58:48.242 --> 00:58:50.666]  I have one question to ask anybody.
[00:58:51.067 --> 00:58:52.349]  What strain they have?
[00:58:53.285 --> 00:58:56.827]  Do you realize they've never been tested the different strains?
[00:58:56.907 --> 00:58:58.707]  No, it's all a scam with PCR tests.
[00:58:58.727 --> 00:59:03.069]  You could turn a PCR test up to 50, and the inventor of it said you could send it to wherever you want.
[00:59:03.089 --> 00:59:08.391]  It would say the air had arsenic in it, or lead, or whatever, or a virus.
[00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:11.053]  You set it to what you want, and it's like a metal detector.
[00:59:11.073 --> 00:59:15.755]  You turn a metal detector up in the air to the highest level, it'll say there's gold in the air.
[00:59:16.115 --> 00:59:16.495]  It's not.
[00:59:16.555 --> 00:59:17.435]  You just turn it up on high.
[00:59:17.756 --> 00:59:18.696]  So yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:59:20.686 --> 00:59:23.428]  Well, brother, you just keep up the fight, and I'm here with you always.
[00:59:24.149 --> 00:59:24.809]  Hey, great point.
[00:59:24.849 --> 00:59:26.190]  I kind of miss what you said up front.
[00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:26.570]  I get it.
[00:59:26.590 --> 00:59:29.473]  You're saying Venezuelans were sent back to overthrow it.
[00:59:29.993 --> 00:59:33.516]  I'm not saying that couldn't be part of it, but the people are sick of the communists.
[00:59:34.516 --> 00:59:36.998]  I mean, that's women, children, men, poor people.
[00:59:38.319 --> 00:59:39.000]  They're tired of it.
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:41.622]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:59:41.642 --> 00:59:42.482]  Go ahead.
[00:59:42.502 --> 00:59:43.463]  Sorry, Robo Disco.
[00:59:43.483 --> 00:59:45.104]  Go ahead.
[00:59:45.164 --> 00:59:47.226]  Venezuela and Brazil are really interesting
[00:59:47.961 --> 00:59:49.382]  I can feel freedom rising across the planet.
[00:59:49.462 --> 00:59:50.803]  I can feel human liberty exploding.
[00:59:50.823 --> 00:59:51.523]  I can feel your will.
[01:00:17.555 --> 01:00:19.856]  Evil is in full panic mode right now.
[01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:22.418]  God is real.
[01:00:23.138 --> 01:00:23.959]  God is great.
[01:00:24.719 --> 01:00:27.861]  God is the compendium of the entire universe and beyond.
[01:00:27.881 --> 01:00:32.584]  And I want all of you to hear me now.
[01:00:34.565 --> 01:00:40.789]  The tectonic developments, culturally, spiritually, economically, has just begun.
[01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:53.977]  And it is your choice, spiritually now, which side you're going to be on that will predestine your entire future throughout the universe.
[01:00:55.118 --> 01:00:56.659]  Earth is only the launch point.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:07.046]  The eye has not seen, the ear has not heard, the mind has not conceived what God has in store for us.
[01:01:08.848 --> 01:01:09.469]  You can feel it.
[01:01:09.489 --> 01:01:10.951]  You can see it.
[01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:12.232]  You can touch it.
[01:01:12.292 --> 01:01:13.033]  You can taste it.
[01:01:13.634 --> 01:01:17.499]  You know it in your very bones, the heart of your soul.
[01:01:19.221 --> 01:01:23.606]  Reach out to God and ask God to lead God and direct you.
[01:01:24.487 --> 01:01:25.809]  Ask God to sanctify you.
[01:01:26.764 --> 01:01:28.005]  Ask God to purify you.
[01:01:28.585 --> 01:01:31.807]  Reach out across the time-space continuum.
[01:01:32.448 --> 01:01:41.334]  Make the electrical connection to infinity and transcend Satan, the failed little g-god of this world.
[01:01:43.936 --> 01:01:48.739]  We are living in such an incredibly historical time right now.
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:54.102]  Yes, these are the times that try men's souls
[01:01:55.083 --> 01:02:03.049]  But it is the trying of the soul that makes us face reality and become what we really should be.
[01:02:05.851 --> 01:02:09.513]  Massive news on the election, on Trump, on it all.
[01:02:09.533 --> 01:02:10.374]  We'll be getting to it.
[01:02:10.754 --> 01:02:12.836]  Defiant Trump, the whole rally at the same place.
[01:02:12.876 --> 01:02:15.077]  He was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[01:02:16.619 --> 01:02:18.180]  And I'm the victim of fake news sometimes.
[01:02:19.215 --> 01:02:19.836]  I'm not perfect.
[01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:21.077]  Alex Jones is not always right.
[01:02:21.458 --> 01:02:29.907]  I'm right most of the time, but I'm also always trying to tell the truth, trying to get it right, trying to not make a mistake.
[01:02:29.967 --> 01:02:30.508]  Big difference.
[01:02:31.068 --> 01:02:31.929]  That's why we're so accurate.
[01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:33.111]  No, I'm not always right.
[01:02:33.972 --> 01:02:34.572]  That means ever.
[01:02:34.632 --> 01:02:35.473]  Jones is always right.
[01:02:35.533 --> 01:02:36.274]  No, I'm not always right.
[01:02:38.677 --> 01:02:39.338]  So that said,
[01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:45.089]  Last week, and it was the campaign said it, because I guess they just said it, Trump got pissed.
[01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:47.249]  They said, okay, we agree with Secret Service, no more outdoor rallies.
[01:02:47.289 --> 01:02:49.070]  And I personally think that's the right move.
[01:02:51.131 --> 01:02:55.072]  But Trump believes in total destiny and is beyond confident.
[01:02:55.753 --> 01:03:03.756]  He is going back to Butler, they haven't announced the date yet, at the same site he got shot on the 13th, 17 days ago.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.922]  He is going back there.
[01:03:13.163 --> 01:03:14.064]  We'll be talking about that.
[01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:15.525]  And you talk about rolling the dice.
[01:03:16.927 --> 01:03:19.589]  But for Trump, it's something else.
[01:03:20.711 --> 01:03:25.035]  And if it's tough and if he can do it, he'll do it.
[01:03:26.316 --> 01:03:27.498]  I personally am
[01:03:30.171 --> 01:03:30.792]  A little different.
[01:03:31.572 --> 01:03:34.295]  I would have the courage to do it, but I would strategically not.
[01:03:34.335 --> 01:03:41.562]  But I think Trump understands metaphysically, and he's probably, is smarter than me at a spiritual level, that he's got to put his skin in the game.
[01:03:42.323 --> 01:03:50.811]  Well, I think he's already put skin in the game, but I defer, demur, abdicate to obviously his decision.
[01:03:50.831 --> 01:03:52.853]  So I say, please lift him up in prayer.
[01:03:52.873 --> 01:03:54.935]  But, uh,
[01:03:57.669 --> 01:04:00.290]  It's dangerous, so give me your take on that as well.
[01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:01.971]  All right, we've got loaded phone lines.
[01:04:02.451 --> 01:04:03.211]  All these great people.
[01:04:03.231 --> 01:04:04.571]  We'll take them in the order they're received.
[01:04:04.611 --> 01:04:06.872]  I said any subject you want to cover, so it'll be wild cards.
[01:04:07.372 --> 01:04:09.513]  Let's talk to Wayne in the great state of Oklahoma.
[01:04:09.533 --> 01:04:10.433]  We call it North Texas.
[01:04:10.473 --> 01:04:13.274]  They call us Southern Oklahoma.
[01:04:14.174 --> 01:04:15.855]  Wayne in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[01:04:15.895 --> 01:04:16.215]  Go ahead.
[01:04:17.656 --> 01:04:18.716]  Okay, Alex.
[01:04:20.576 --> 01:04:25.378]  The bullet that hit Trump isn't the one in that picture.
[01:04:26.621 --> 01:04:31.344]  Trump's hand, his right hand, was on the podium when he was shot to the ear.
[01:04:33.425 --> 01:04:38.848]  So the picture shows his right hand being plainly visible in that picture.
[01:04:39.268 --> 01:04:45.252]  So that means that that bullet isn't the bullet that's in that picture.
[01:04:46.853 --> 01:04:47.353]  Okay.
[01:04:48.354 --> 01:04:49.374]  That's out of the way now.
[01:04:50.635 --> 01:04:54.157]  Give me a huge favor.
[01:04:54.197 --> 01:04:54.997]  Give me a huge favor.
[01:04:55.037 --> 01:04:55.838]  Turn your radio off.
[01:04:58.530 --> 01:04:59.431]  I'm listening to you.
[01:04:59.471 --> 01:05:01.272]  Let me turn it down here.
[01:05:01.652 --> 01:05:03.513]  Yeah, it's kind of a rule of talk radio.
[01:05:04.434 --> 01:05:06.415]  Look, all I'm saying is eight rounds were shot at him.
[01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:07.215]  They admit that now.
[01:05:07.616 --> 01:05:08.236]  One man died.
[01:05:08.276 --> 01:05:08.936]  Two got wounded.
[01:05:08.956 --> 01:05:09.737]  He got shot at.
[01:05:10.217 --> 01:05:11.918]  Yeah, never mind about all that.
[01:05:12.619 --> 01:05:21.124]  I'm saying that all the illustrators that shows the trajectory of the bullets, the second shot went under his right shoulder.
[01:05:22.525 --> 01:05:26.407]  Okay, we know it's not the first bullet because that's out of the way.
[01:05:28.206 --> 01:05:31.328]  If these illustrators are right, it's not the second bullet.
[01:05:31.849 --> 01:05:33.350]  So whose bullet is it?
[01:05:37.073 --> 01:05:42.257]  Well, we know they shot eight bullets at him, so I'm not putting down what you're saying.
[01:05:42.397 --> 01:05:43.237]  Tell me what you're saying.
[01:05:43.277 --> 01:05:44.138]  Tell me what you're saying.
[01:05:44.218 --> 01:05:47.521]  Well, I'm saying that somebody slipped a bullet in right there.
[01:05:49.582 --> 01:05:50.663]  Or could have slipped one.
[01:05:50.963 --> 01:05:55.807]  It's either that or it's the second bullet, and the illustrators has got it wrong.
[01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:57.917]  But it needs to be examined.
[01:05:58.678 --> 01:06:03.201]  Somebody needs to prove that that bullet needs, it should be there.
[01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:04.602]  No, I hear you.
[01:06:04.622 --> 01:06:07.124]  Well, the point is the Secret Service is not even doing an investigation.
[01:06:07.144 --> 01:06:09.826]  That came out in Congress in hearings the last two days.
[01:06:09.846 --> 01:06:13.308]  They're busy trying to cover it up because they're trying to cover their ass.
[01:06:13.388 --> 01:06:14.049]  I appreciate your call.
[01:06:14.089 --> 01:06:14.769]  Great points, Wayne.
[01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:16.311]  We should investigate that.
[01:06:16.431 --> 01:06:18.512]  Mark in New York on assassination of Trump.
[01:06:18.913 --> 01:06:20.053]  The attempted assassination of Trump.
[01:06:20.093 --> 01:06:20.454]  Go ahead.
[01:06:22.715 --> 01:06:23.196]  You hear me?
[01:06:23.576 --> 01:06:23.916]  I can.
[01:06:23.936 --> 01:06:24.437]  Mark, go ahead.
[01:06:24.477 --> 01:06:24.777]  Welcome.
[01:06:25.569 --> 01:06:28.132]  Okay, yeah, I want to make a point here.
[01:06:28.413 --> 01:06:36.123]  I've listened to you for many years and I'm going to point out a challenge to you and your listeners.
[01:06:36.744 --> 01:06:45.086]  I'm willing because you used to have a team that would go to a location and interview people and get all the top news stories.
[01:06:45.486 --> 01:06:46.986]  I am willing to put out $200.
[01:06:48.047 --> 01:07:00.610]  I'm sure you could get another 99 listeners to put together a news team to go to Butler, Pennsylvania and get the answers that are not being answered because you're a news reporter, okay?
[01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:05.631]  One thing that's not being answered is why was it moved from the airport
[01:07:06.593 --> 01:07:07.754]  To the fairground.
[01:07:07.834 --> 01:07:13.757]  Was it because actually there was a problem at the airport or was it because they could get a better shot?
[01:07:14.378 --> 01:07:15.098]  Oh, I totally agree.
[01:07:15.118 --> 01:07:16.179]  We got to ask why that was done.
[01:07:16.219 --> 01:07:19.401]  But since you bring the subject up, hold on, let me see you bring it up.
[01:07:20.976 --> 01:07:22.557]  I've been in bankruptcy for two years.
[01:07:23.518 --> 01:07:25.138]  The Democratic Party's suing me.
[01:07:25.158 --> 01:07:28.580]  They've spent, like, now $70 million trying to shut us down.
[01:07:29.421 --> 01:07:31.162]  That's in the news, okay, in the last six years.
[01:07:31.722 --> 01:07:36.645]  Whole deep state lying about us, rigging trials, show trials, already found guilty, everything.
[01:07:37.025 --> 01:07:41.788]  We're crushed down to the... I had, like, 100 employees five years ago.
[01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:42.328]  We're down to, like, 42.
[01:07:43.769 --> 01:07:44.069]  Okay.
[01:07:44.509 --> 01:07:48.891]  So we, that's counting the janitor and the customer service and the crew.
[01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:51.293]  So production crew, we got about 15 people.
[01:07:51.913 --> 01:07:54.934]  So we don't have the funds to go places either.
[01:07:55.174 --> 01:07:56.455]  You can say, well, we'll just donate the money.
[01:07:56.475 --> 01:07:56.895]  Well, great.
[01:07:56.975 --> 01:07:57.656]  Then let it come in.
[01:07:58.356 --> 01:07:58.636]  Okay.
[01:07:58.716 --> 01:07:59.336]  And I'm not bitching.
[01:07:59.356 --> 01:08:00.417]  I don't sit here and flog people.
[01:08:00.457 --> 01:08:00.857]  Give me money.
[01:08:00.897 --> 01:08:01.217]  Give me money.
[01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:02.358]  We don't have the money.
[01:08:03.379 --> 01:08:06.281]  If they shut this place down, I will rapidly work for somebody else.
[01:08:06.301 --> 01:08:07.342]  I'll try to get the crew back.
[01:08:07.823 --> 01:08:09.384]  And we've got people that are ready to do that.
[01:08:09.704 --> 01:08:11.285]  I'm trying to save info wars right now.
[01:08:11.345 --> 01:08:12.466]  So thank you for caring.
[01:08:13.467 --> 01:08:14.988]  I would have 50 reporters right now.
[01:08:15.028 --> 01:08:16.009]  We'd be 24 hours a day.
[01:08:16.029 --> 01:08:18.391]  We were building towards that when they did this.
[01:08:18.411 --> 01:08:19.592]  We're 10 hours live a day.
[01:08:20.012 --> 01:08:22.534]  And we're reaching 30, 40 million people a day conservatively.
[01:08:22.814 --> 01:08:24.055]  So we're doing the best job we can.
[01:08:24.095 --> 01:08:24.396]  Go ahead.
[01:08:25.476 --> 01:08:25.817]  Okay.
[01:08:25.997 --> 01:08:28.139]  Also, I want to make other points.
[01:08:28.379 --> 01:08:29.820]  The location of the state.
[01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:31.591]  Why was the stage there?
[01:08:31.851 --> 01:08:33.232]  The location of the podium?
[01:08:33.272 --> 01:08:34.452]  Why was the podium there?
[01:08:34.853 --> 01:08:41.016]  Why is there only four cartridges when you say there's eight shots?
[01:08:41.036 --> 01:08:48.320]  The FBI director says there was eight shell casings and a lot of the first numbers we had was five to eight shots from the acoustics.
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:48.981]  We don't know.
[01:08:49.341 --> 01:08:52.863]  So I know it'd be great to be God and be omnipresent and know what happened.
[01:08:53.163 --> 01:08:53.703]  We don't know.
[01:08:53.743 --> 01:08:54.464]  We're speculating.
[01:08:55.393 --> 01:08:56.893]  Okay, I have a couple more points.
[01:08:57.313 --> 01:09:06.895]  Okay, I believe the explosives in the vehicle were he was sending a drone out to see if he could actually put the bombs underneath the stage.
[01:09:07.095 --> 01:09:07.975]  I totally agree.
[01:09:08.075 --> 01:09:09.555]  I think that's what I've said.
[01:09:09.615 --> 01:09:11.156]  I've said they might want to blow up his plane.
[01:09:11.296 --> 01:09:19.637]  I said that they might want to poison him, truck bombing, but also drones with explosives is the cutting edge of military operations, and I think you're right.
[01:09:20.697 --> 01:09:22.178]  Okay, I want to make one more point.
[01:09:22.278 --> 01:09:24.558]  I want to talk about the person on the water tower.
[01:09:25.077 --> 01:09:31.566]  Okay, I think there are comparisons between JFK and this assassination.
[01:09:31.706 --> 01:09:33.468]  One was successful, one was not.
[01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:39.235]  I think the person on the water tower was actually the Jack Ruby in this plan.
[01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:43.361]  I think there was a lot of people involved and the plan was, hey,
[01:09:43.821 --> 01:09:47.262]  If Croc says, okay, it's July 13th.
[01:09:47.382 --> 01:09:48.423]  I'm on the building.
[01:09:48.503 --> 01:09:49.783]  I'm going to raise up my hands.
[01:09:49.863 --> 01:09:50.964]  I'm going to surrender.
[01:09:51.244 --> 01:09:52.705]  I'm going to turn everybody in.
[01:09:52.725 --> 01:09:54.945]  I'm going to start naming names and everything.
[01:09:54.965 --> 01:09:59.227]  I think the guy on the water tower, the plan was he was to be Jack Ruby.
[01:09:59.507 --> 01:10:03.869]  He was to take Croc out and make sure that he wasn't going to leave that place alive.
[01:10:03.889 --> 01:10:04.549]  You mean Crocs?
[01:10:04.649 --> 01:10:05.349]  He wasn't Croc?
[01:10:05.649 --> 01:10:05.930]  Crocs.
[01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:06.710]  Yeah.
[01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:12.192]  I think the plan was he was the Jack Ruby in the plan and his plan was to make sure that
[01:10:12.977 --> 01:10:16.778]  That guy was not going to leave the top of the roof alive.
[01:10:16.798 --> 01:10:18.178]  I agree with you.
[01:10:18.238 --> 01:10:18.939]  I appreciate your call.
[01:10:19.519 --> 01:10:19.979]  Great points.
[01:10:20.179 --> 01:10:24.320]  Definitely the Secret Service stood down, and they didn't shoot the shooter until he'd shot.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.480]  So I think what you're saying is pretty much fact.
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.381]  I don't know if it was a water tower shot or whatever, but yeah.
[01:10:28.681 --> 01:10:29.401]  Great points, sir.
[01:10:29.441 --> 01:10:30.081]  Thank you very much.
[01:10:30.541 --> 01:10:33.202]  William in Scotland on maturing and critical thinking.
[01:10:33.242 --> 01:10:33.942]  Go ahead, William.
[01:10:36.083 --> 01:10:37.083]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:10:37.603 --> 01:10:41.444]  I was listening to your show yesterday, and you were talking about how we have matured.
[01:10:42.037 --> 01:10:43.458]  I really did align with that.
[01:10:43.558 --> 01:10:46.159]  I feel like we're living through a revolution.
[01:10:46.799 --> 01:10:50.841]  People are waking up and smelling the tyranny, and we are winning this.
[01:10:51.021 --> 01:10:56.183]  And on a personal level, in terms of how I've matured, I feel I've really developed my critical thinking.
[01:10:56.603 --> 01:11:01.625]  And the best things I've learned are simple questions like, so what, says who, why, and is it though?
[01:11:02.086 --> 01:11:09.829]  But there's one thing that I'm not aligning with you, that I've heard yesterday and today with you, and that's the implication that Donald Trump is the saviour.
[01:11:10.771 --> 01:11:13.212]  A couple of years ago, I believed he possibly was.
[01:11:13.532 --> 01:11:22.397]  Now in 2024, because of the people that he aligned himself with and what happened with that fake vaccine, I no longer believe that Trump is the saviour.
[01:11:22.417 --> 01:11:26.499]  He could be, but I think there's more that we can do as individuals.
[01:11:26.639 --> 01:11:31.962]  I would even go so far to say the new rock stars are community organisers.
[01:11:32.302 --> 01:11:35.904]  There's more that we can do to create change in our own communities.
[01:11:36.383 --> 01:11:41.746]  And you also talked there about evil, about the Goatman, about Satan and his minions.
[01:11:42.086 --> 01:11:44.407]  Well, there's one thing I know about that crew, Alex.
[01:11:44.768 --> 01:11:55.934]  Those evil beings do not like it when us humans bang our heads together, get together and say, we're going to work together, we're going to get along and we're going to work through the light.
[01:11:56.474 --> 01:11:59.175]  So that's what I'd like to see more and more from people.
[01:11:59.215 --> 01:12:04.118]  And here in Scotland, I can report to you that there's a number of us that are learning about community organisation.
[01:12:04.929 --> 01:12:05.870]  We're getting together.
[01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:07.592]  We're doing public speeches.
[01:12:07.932 --> 01:12:09.854]  We're doing rallies.
[01:12:10.074 --> 01:12:11.796]  We're putting on meme exhibitions.
[01:12:12.296 --> 01:12:14.339]  And it's a great time to be alive.
[01:12:14.399 --> 01:12:16.000]  As I said, I feel it's a revolution.
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:19.143]  And I love the part that you're playing, Alex.
[01:12:19.584 --> 01:12:21.045]  And we are going to win this.
[01:12:21.165 --> 01:12:21.646]  We're winning it.
[01:12:23.968 --> 01:12:26.549]  Well let me just say, William, that I totally agree with you.
[01:12:26.569 --> 01:12:27.689]  I want to be 100% clear.
[01:12:28.169 --> 01:12:30.229]  I don't think Trump is Jesus Christ.
[01:12:30.489 --> 01:12:31.030]  Far from it.
[01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:34.150]  And neither am I. And I don't think Elon Musk is.
[01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:36.071]  I don't think Elon Musk is our savior.
[01:12:36.091 --> 01:12:37.491]  I don't think Tucker Carlson is our savior.
[01:12:37.931 --> 01:12:45.973]  I think God working through us, all of us collectively, is how we're going to turn this around and not have some utopia, but at least not be a satanically directed civilization.
[01:12:46.733 --> 01:12:47.194]  I don't know.
[01:12:59.505 --> 01:13:07.631]  Peacefully talking about uniting the kingdom and for sovereignty, and they arrested him on terrorism charges for his speech.
[01:13:08.311 --> 01:13:10.012]  That is tyranny of the crown.
[01:13:10.393 --> 01:13:13.955]  The same crown that attacked Ireland and Scotland, you know, hundreds of years ago.
[01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:14.836]  The same tyranny.
[01:13:15.556 --> 01:13:18.618]  Those police are literally like Nazi stormtroopers.
[01:13:19.339 --> 01:13:22.001]  And there they are, arresting him.
[01:13:22.021 --> 01:13:24.983]  And look, was that a bag over his head?
[01:13:26.075 --> 01:13:28.863]  I mean, my God, what has happened?
[01:13:29.464 --> 01:13:30.226]  Where is Tommy?
[01:13:31.048 --> 01:13:31.991]  The point is, where is Tommy?
[01:13:35.009 --> 01:13:35.610]  We don't know.
[01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:39.453]  We think he might be in Tenerife in the Canary Islands or he might be in Dubai.
[01:13:39.773 --> 01:13:43.016]  But when you talk about these contrasting... What do you mean?
[01:13:43.096 --> 01:13:46.839]  He just got arrested as a terrorist for free speech.
[01:13:46.919 --> 01:13:48.740]  He escaped.
[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:49.581]  He's out of the country.
[01:13:50.021 --> 01:13:50.462]  He's safe.
[01:13:50.862 --> 01:13:52.524]  He put up a post on his channel.
[01:13:52.544 --> 01:13:53.404]  He's got a new phone.
[01:13:53.664 --> 01:13:55.146]  He's going to be giving an update real soon.
[01:13:55.386 --> 01:14:00.310]  But when you talk about that sort of stuff, Alex, I feel you're talking about patriots versus the globalists.
[01:14:00.819 --> 01:14:04.622]  But I feel it's also about collectivism versus the individualists.
[01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:09.185]  And the crowd that are pursuing Tommy Robinson, they are really the collectivists.
[01:14:09.345 --> 01:14:10.545]  And that's much of the battle.
[01:14:10.826 --> 01:14:13.667]  I think much of the battle is with us as individuals.
[01:14:14.028 --> 01:14:22.433]  And when we become individualists, when we focus on standing up for ourselves, when we no longer choose ignorance, then I think that's how we win this.
[01:14:22.553 --> 01:14:23.114]  No, I agree.
[01:14:23.154 --> 01:14:28.057]  But I mean, I think what Tommy's doing, pointing out the invasion of the UK, is very, very good work.
[01:14:28.437 --> 01:14:29.638]  And I appreciate your call, William.
[01:14:30.569 --> 01:14:32.991]  All right, let's go to Sophia in Colorado.
[01:14:33.111 --> 01:14:34.192]  Go ahead, you're on the ear.
[01:14:34.252 --> 01:14:34.572]  Welcome.
[01:14:34.592 --> 01:14:36.413]  Hi, Alex.
[01:14:36.533 --> 01:14:44.599]  Well, I just wanted to start by saying that I've been listening to your show, my family and I, for about six years, and I'm almost 19 years old and I listen daily.
[01:14:44.999 --> 01:14:47.541]  But the point that I wanted to talk about is
[01:14:48.436 --> 01:14:53.560]  My mom grew up in Colombia, and over there, back in the 80s and 90s, it was a total hellhole.
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:55.861]  They had drug cartels, all that stuff.
[01:14:56.221 --> 01:15:05.328]  But they would actually go to Venezuela and get all of these types of, different types of food, exotic fruit, everything.
[01:15:05.388 --> 01:15:07.289]  Like, all these, you know, delicacies.
[01:15:07.929 --> 01:15:11.792]  And they were the richest, richest country in Latin America.
[01:15:12.653 --> 01:15:15.795]  And then you fast forward only 10 years, and look what happened.
[01:15:17.073 --> 01:15:18.695]  That's right, communism destroys everything.
[01:15:18.715 --> 01:15:21.938]  They promise everybody something free, and the minute it takes over, total slavery.
[01:15:22.919 --> 01:15:23.680]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:34.691]  And I was also going to say that Colombia, it's interesting because they see that happening in Venezuela, and yet their current president in Colombia is a total socialist petro.
[01:15:34.951 --> 01:15:37.654]  He's a criminal everything, and they voted for this guy.
[01:15:38.395 --> 01:15:40.497]  And another thing I wanted to point out is
[01:15:41.147 --> 01:15:42.950]  This is just the history of communism, right?
[01:15:42.970 --> 01:15:44.612]  We see communism throughout history.
[01:15:46.135 --> 01:15:49.760]  It has a signature, it has a face, it has a smell.
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:51.523]  It does the same thing every time.
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:58.324]  Yes, and what I was going to point out is the turning point, and I think America needs to listen to this right now, because this is very important.
[01:15:58.845 --> 01:16:01.347]  Our turning point is we give up our guns, that's it.
[01:16:01.867 --> 01:16:02.688]  That's where it ends.
[01:16:03.128 --> 01:16:04.969]  It ends when the Second Amendment goes away.
[01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:08.512]  That's where we lose power, and the power of information, the power of guns.
[01:16:08.612 --> 01:16:09.313]  That's what we lose.
[01:16:09.633 --> 01:16:12.015]  First and Second Amendment, that's why they're first and second.
[01:16:13.106 --> 01:16:13.546]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:14.087 --> 01:16:18.531]  And the last thing I wanted to talk to you, Alex, is I just wanted to plug all of the InfoWars products.
[01:16:18.611 --> 01:16:19.812]  I've been using them for years.
[01:16:20.372 --> 01:16:21.473]  My family's been using them.
[01:16:21.493 --> 01:16:24.155]  And I'm currently going through a little bit of a fast right now.
[01:16:24.376 --> 01:16:27.758]  And I have been drinking the multivitamin, InfoWars multivitamin.
[01:16:28.239 --> 01:16:36.126]  And the amount of energy that I have, the amount of clarity that I'm getting, my workouts are going amazing from just the multivitamin.
[01:16:36.166 --> 01:16:36.766]  It's just great.
[01:16:36.786 --> 01:16:38.788]  So I wanted to thank the InfoWars crew for that.
[01:16:39.028 --> 01:16:40.330]  Well, thank you, Sophia.
[01:16:40.451 --> 01:16:43.235]  And everything we sell is the highest grade, the highest quality.
[01:16:43.616 --> 01:16:47.423]  Doesn't mean I'm the best spokesperson, but we only sell the highest quality at the best prices we can.
[01:16:48.044 --> 01:16:49.767]  What do you think is going to happen in Venezuela?
[01:16:49.787 --> 01:16:50.688]  Do you think Maduro's done?
[01:16:52.378 --> 01:17:05.245]  Well, I mean, I've studied a lot of communism and it's kind of my forte, and what I would say is it will be successful only if the military, the police, get on their side.
[01:17:05.325 --> 01:17:11.489]  Because if they do not have force in that way, and I'm not saying that we need to just force, like the communists... No, no, but it's true.
[01:17:11.549 --> 01:17:12.590]  Communists use force.
[01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:13.850]  That's what George Orwell said.
[01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:15.491]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[01:17:16.372 --> 01:17:18.313]  Yes, so I think ultimately the goal is
[01:17:18.863 --> 01:17:20.364]  We need to blow this up.
[01:17:20.485 --> 01:17:21.706]  Everyone talk about Venezuela.
[01:17:21.726 --> 01:17:22.807]  Everyone talk about what's going on.
[01:17:23.307 --> 01:17:29.052]  They need to have the police on their side, military on their side, and put the pressure, continuous pressure.
[01:17:29.112 --> 01:17:33.756]  They cannot give up, keep going, because their country will be totally destroyed.
[01:17:33.776 --> 01:17:35.578]  I mean, 30 years of living in that hellhole.
[01:17:35.918 --> 01:17:36.979]  They all are starving.
[01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:38.360]  They have no power.
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:40.262]  It's North Korea of Latin America.
[01:17:40.302 --> 01:17:43.965]  Yeah, for people who don't know, Argentina and Venezuela, until the 50s,
[01:17:45.086 --> 01:17:45.427]  We're good to go.
[01:18:00.638 --> 01:18:02.339]  It's horrible, and at first it's great.
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:09.684]  Hey, we're communist, we're gonna go take that farm, take that business, take that, and then there's no businesses left, and there's no experts left, and it all falls apart.
[01:18:10.145 --> 01:18:11.766]  Thank you so much, Sophia, great points.
[01:18:12.546 --> 01:18:15.489]  All right, Mike in Virginia, food production in South America.
[01:18:15.869 --> 01:18:22.453]  Now, the globals are cutting food production off everywhere, and that makes them collapse, and they come here, and they become globalist minions and dependent.
[01:18:23.174 --> 01:18:24.395]  Mike in Virginia, go ahead.
[01:18:25.856 --> 01:18:27.097]  Yes, Alex.
[01:18:28.944 --> 01:18:36.147]  Quite a few years ago, George Bush made about a million acre purchase in Northern Parkway.
[01:18:36.267 --> 01:18:38.427]  I remember.
[01:18:39.468 --> 01:18:45.570]  Well, now they've got the Belt or a Belt Road initiative is running the Biocean Corridor.
[01:18:47.851 --> 01:18:48.851]  Right in the middle of it.
[01:18:50.711 --> 01:18:52.752]  If you look at Google Earth, you'll see.
[01:18:54.453 --> 01:18:55.833]  I've been there.
[01:18:55.853 --> 01:18:57.954]  It's about like South Texas.
[01:18:59.113 --> 01:19:00.793]  There's food lots just popping up.
[01:19:02.614 --> 01:19:11.396]  And they're also talking about China's going to put the largest pork production facility in the world.
[01:19:12.496 --> 01:19:17.897]  And they're going to tie it into the two ports, one in Chile and one in Brazil.
[01:19:19.158 --> 01:19:28.440]  And that'll be able to put the food production right to our east coast.
[01:19:39.838 --> 01:19:43.661]  That's right.
[01:19:43.761 --> 01:19:53.268]  In Europe, in Ireland, in the UK, in Asia, they are shutting down food production and then moving it to Africa and Latin America that global is fully controlled.
[01:19:53.549 --> 01:19:57.632]  So they make them communist for decades to get them fully controlled, then the big corporations move into control.
[01:19:59.173 --> 01:19:59.453]  Yes.
[01:20:00.414 --> 01:20:05.338]  They're also working on the road that's going to tie to this up to the dairy gap.
[01:20:05.578 --> 01:20:05.759]  Yep.
[01:20:06.139 --> 01:20:08.221]  Which you'll see directly up into it.
[01:20:10.783 --> 01:20:11.884]  You're a smart guy, Mike.
[01:20:11.924 --> 01:20:12.624]  What do we do about it?
[01:20:13.305 --> 01:20:14.606]  We don't let them shut down our farms.
[01:20:15.207 --> 01:20:16.067]  We promote local.
[01:20:16.107 --> 01:20:16.448]  Exactly.
[01:20:17.508 --> 01:20:18.029]  Exactly.
[01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:19.430]  Exactly.
[01:20:20.971 --> 01:20:27.437]  But if they come in and burn them down and buy up the farms and buy up the farmland,
[01:20:29.516 --> 01:20:30.417]  Uh, what do we do?
[01:20:31.979 --> 01:20:33.420]  Well, we're under economic attack.
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:34.501]  We're under cultural attack.
[01:20:34.521 --> 01:20:35.662]  We're under spiritual attack.
[01:20:35.682 --> 01:20:37.063]  We're under our borders are being imploded.
[01:20:37.083 --> 01:20:38.104]  They're trying to start World War III.
[01:20:38.124 --> 01:20:38.305]  Yeah.
[01:20:38.725 --> 01:20:48.794]  This is a desperate, if you're big BlackRock and you control 80 plus percent of the world, you're like, well, we'll just pass laws and shut down our competition, consolidate power, and then use food as a weapon to make people capitulate politically to our aims.
[01:20:49.215 --> 01:20:51.176]  And they brag how they'll use food as a weapon.
[01:20:51.196 --> 01:20:51.457]  They have the 1993
[01:20:52.938 --> 01:20:53.178]  Exactly.
[01:20:53.198 --> 01:20:53.398]  If you...
[01:21:20.717 --> 01:21:25.200]  Pay attention and you read a little bit and research a little bit, you can see it coming.
[01:21:26.861 --> 01:21:34.245]  It's just getting the people to understand what's coming and how to combat it and not just roll along with it.
[01:21:34.425 --> 01:21:35.246]  Well, you just nailed it.
[01:21:35.286 --> 01:21:38.508]  We'll put your call out as its own video on X. It'll get probably a million views.
[01:21:38.548 --> 01:21:42.330]  But yes, European and U.S.
[01:21:42.370 --> 01:21:46.713]  foods production being shut down by globalists.
[01:21:46.773 --> 01:21:47.633]  Learn what comes next.
[01:21:47.673 --> 01:21:48.334]  Thank you so much.
[01:21:52.603 --> 01:21:55.645]  Western food supply being cut off by globalists.
[01:21:55.705 --> 01:21:56.286]  Learn why.
[01:21:56.506 --> 01:21:58.968]  Because, I mean, this is happening.
[01:22:00.889 --> 01:22:01.790]  This is going down.
[01:22:03.031 --> 01:22:18.883]  Current lifestyles and consumption patterns of the affluent middle class involving high meat intake, consumption of large amounts of frozen and convenience foods, ownership of motor vehicles, golf courses, small electric appliances, home and workplace air conditioning, and
[01:22:20.126 --> 01:22:22.170]  Suburban housing are not sustainable.
[01:22:22.210 --> 01:22:24.995]  Murray Strong, who's the father of all this modern plan.
[01:22:25.676 --> 01:22:26.297]  And there he is.
[01:22:26.458 --> 01:22:27.880]  That's the UN, folks.
[01:22:28.782 --> 01:22:30.966]  But again, they're going to cut your resources off for control.
[01:22:30.986 --> 01:22:31.827]  It's not about the earth.
[01:22:32.168 --> 01:22:32.869]  It's feudalism.
[01:22:33.834 --> 01:22:34.414]  We'll be right back.
[01:22:34.435 --> 01:22:34.835]  Stay with us.
[01:22:35.275 --> 01:22:38.538]  This is a real attempt to turn America and the world around.
[01:22:38.558 --> 01:22:40.559]  This is a real attempt to stop World War Three.
[01:22:40.579 --> 01:22:45.423]  This is a real attempt to save civilization for our children, because there's not just evil in the world.
[01:22:45.744 --> 01:22:46.584]  There's good as well.
[01:22:46.945 --> 01:22:58.754]  And so you've got to decide that that's happening and join it and promote it and support Trump and support us and spread the word, because that's what they fear, is when you get a mission and you get committed and you take action.
[01:22:58.774 --> 01:23:00.596]  So tell everybody about the links at Rolex Jones.

[01:23:17.890 --> 01:23:19.651]  A big sale going on right now.
[01:23:19.991 --> 01:23:21.693]  Everybody needs nitric mousse.

[01:23:28.278 --> 01:23:29.539]  This is a war!
[01:23:35.131 --> 01:23:37.512]  We've got some key breaking special reports coming up.
[01:23:38.513 --> 01:23:42.675]  And we've got a very special guest, an amazing economist, Martin Armstrong.
[01:23:43.195 --> 01:23:45.317]  Made incredible predictions that have been so accurate coming up.
[01:23:45.857 --> 01:23:47.818]  Start of the next hour, we're taking your phone calls right now.
[01:23:48.398 --> 01:23:50.459]  But some of the stories up on InfoWars.com.
[01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:57.623]  Hillary Clinton, whose campaign manager attended satanic spirit-cooking Alistair Crowley rituals, calls Trump weird.
[01:23:58.884 --> 01:24:04.487]  That's right, he's weird, because he doesn't kidnap kids in Haiti like the head of the Clinton Foundation did.
[01:24:05.970 --> 01:24:09.071]  So we've got so much more coming up on that front.
[01:24:09.151 --> 01:24:10.292]  Also, news on Kamala.
[01:24:10.832 --> 01:24:12.213]  Yep, don't look her in the eyes.
[01:24:12.273 --> 01:24:15.554]  Father of Harris intern recounts office horror stories.
[01:24:16.575 --> 01:24:19.116]  Meanwhile, Harris is making a lot of new announcements.
[01:24:19.636 --> 01:24:24.378]  She hired a legal alien who attacked a woman to be part of a jobs program while serving as San Francisco D.A.
[01:24:24.838 --> 01:24:25.959]  The woman is a monster.
[01:24:25.999 --> 01:24:30.221]  She put people in jail for five years for one marijuana cigarette.
[01:24:31.822 --> 01:24:34.683]  But now she wants to release violent criminals from jail.
[01:24:36.170 --> 01:24:37.490]  Let's continue with your phone calls.
[01:24:38.791 --> 01:24:41.452]  Ben in Wisconsin, you're up next on race relations.
[01:24:42.112 --> 01:24:47.193]  They're definitely going to try to cause some type of racial division and racial crisis coming up to the election.
[01:24:47.213 --> 01:24:49.454]  Go ahead.
[01:24:49.534 --> 01:24:49.874]  Am I on?
[01:24:50.234 --> 01:24:50.974]  You are, yep.
[01:24:51.414 --> 01:24:52.395]  Okay, great.
[01:24:52.855 --> 01:24:53.855]  So Alex, I hear you.
[01:24:54.555 --> 01:24:56.876]  I love you, just right off the bat.
[01:24:57.676 --> 01:25:04.698]  I hear you pulling your hair out all the time with these guests and these facts and all this, and the Democrats just do not hear you.
[01:25:05.649 --> 01:25:19.052]  They have employed, they have seized what they feel is the moral high ground by branding and calling Republicans racist, and the Republicans have never answered that question definitively.
[01:25:19.692 --> 01:25:21.572]  They have never put that question to rest.
[01:25:23.113 --> 01:25:24.693]  Well, no, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:25:25.173 --> 01:25:28.994]  There's no way to put that to rest when they say vote for Kamala or you're against a black woman.
[01:25:29.014 --> 01:25:29.714]  She's not black.
[01:25:30.234 --> 01:25:35.375]  They're the ones, they're never, Republicans have answered it definitively in my view.
[01:25:37.287 --> 01:25:40.409]  Well, let me just continue.
[01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:45.594]  So the Democrats are employing the OJ strategy, what I call the OJ Simpson strategy.
[01:25:46.154 --> 01:25:52.579]  That means basically find the racist on the other side, and anything you do, including murder, is okay.
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:54.841]  So they continually do that.
[01:25:54.881 --> 01:25:59.905]  That's why they're signing these lynching laws and all this stuff, just to play on that theme.
[01:26:01.206 --> 01:26:06.350]  So we have to answer that question first, put it to rest, and
[01:26:07.048 --> 01:26:15.453]  Basically fight all the branding and the branding that's been going on for 30 years against the Republican Party of being racist.
[01:26:15.514 --> 01:26:16.854]  It's a big list.
[01:26:17.715 --> 01:26:20.036]  It's risky on how to fix it.
[01:26:20.717 --> 01:26:23.819]  But somehow we have to change the focus on
[01:26:28.881 --> 01:26:33.624]  The Republicans have done overall, not the establishment with the beat you have with Trump, has done a great job reaching out to folks.
[01:26:33.684 --> 01:26:39.027]  And all these great things Trump did with real prison reform and doubling black college funding and all the rest of it.
[01:26:39.407 --> 01:26:42.449]  And the left then just says, give us reparations, which they'll never give them.
[01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:44.411]  Or, you know, free tuition, all this stuff.
[01:26:44.431 --> 01:26:45.852]  It's all just a distraction.
[01:26:46.732 --> 01:26:47.673]  People aren't buying it.
[01:26:48.013 --> 01:26:50.815]  Double, triple the numbers of blacks are voting for Republicans now.
[01:26:51.315 --> 01:26:53.336]  I actually think people are sick of all this race painting.
[01:26:53.356 --> 01:26:54.036]  I think it's failed.
[01:26:54.296 --> 01:27:00.498]  And I think putting them in charge, the Democrats, like we have to respond to their BS, actually puts them in the driver's seat.
[01:27:00.518 --> 01:27:02.058]  I overall disagree with you.
[01:27:04.599 --> 01:27:10.181]  I think Republicans, whether they're white or black or brown, have to stop caring about race and care about general freedom for everybody.
[01:27:10.621 --> 01:27:11.401]  I think that's the answer.
[01:27:12.541 --> 01:27:17.603]  The average Democrat isn't, like Rush Limbaugh would say, they're low information voters.
[01:27:17.703 --> 01:27:18.423]  They don't care.
[01:27:18.945 --> 01:27:22.788]  About any of these facts you're talking about, about any of these great guests.
[01:27:22.828 --> 01:27:24.330]  I'm telling you, the numbers are shifting.
[01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:25.711]  Trump really won the last election.
[01:27:26.051 --> 01:27:27.192]  He's going to win this in a landslide.
[01:27:27.392 --> 01:27:30.034]  We can't let them be in control of the narrative.
[01:27:30.055 --> 01:27:30.715]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:31.215 --> 01:27:32.957]  We have to expose the border is open.
[01:27:32.977 --> 01:27:37.100]  They're bringing in people, give them all this free stuff to displace everybody, particularly black people.
[01:27:37.381 --> 01:27:39.723]  That's the talking point Trump should be on because it's true.
[01:27:40.998 --> 01:27:41.879]  They're screwing you.
[01:27:42.399 --> 01:27:43.541]  They've done nothing for you.
[01:27:43.561 --> 01:27:44.742]  That's what black folks are saying.
[01:27:45.022 --> 01:27:46.383]  We're actually gaining traction.
[01:27:46.784 --> 01:27:51.108]  And you're saying we're losing because we're not doing enough to prove we're not racist.
[01:27:51.208 --> 01:27:59.957]  I've not done anything to black people or anybody else, so I don't need to sit here and say like, oh, transgender support cutting kids' genitals off or you're gonna make them commit suicide.
[01:27:59.997 --> 01:28:03.200]  No, you're the ones making them commit suicide with mutilating them.
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:04.802]  You abused them, not us.
[01:28:06.254 --> 01:28:08.075]  The Democrats destroyed the blue cities.
[01:28:08.295 --> 01:28:09.416]  They turned them into hell holes.
[01:28:10.076 --> 01:28:13.538]  They passed the laws to put black people in jail for longer sentences.
[01:28:14.339 --> 01:28:15.400]  Get on the offense.
[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:19.482]  Don't try to placate Antonio in Georgia.
[01:28:19.502 --> 01:28:20.002]  You're on the air.
[01:28:20.042 --> 01:28:23.745]  Go ahead.
[01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:24.525]  Thank you guys.
[01:28:24.565 --> 01:28:27.407]  Thank you for what you've done for the last 30 years.
[01:28:27.547 --> 01:28:33.311]  The likes of yours, Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, Free Steve Bannon, have actually woke up the populace.
[01:28:35.014 --> 01:28:35.374]  Thank you.
[01:28:35.434 --> 01:28:37.496]  You're keeping us on air, sir.
[01:28:37.516 --> 01:28:41.179]  Let me ask you this question before we get into your point.
[01:28:41.219 --> 01:28:43.922]  What do you make of the last caller and what he was saying?
[01:29:03.499 --> 01:29:15.666]  I'm glad you said something about that, because I was listening to Harrison's broadcast before you came on, and they kind of said something similar, and it had to do with the Republican Party within itself having all of these groups.
[01:29:15.846 --> 01:29:20.029]  You know, you've got to have blacks for Trump, you've got to have Hispanics and all of that.
[01:29:20.429 --> 01:29:23.531]  When we start playing that game, we start losing.
[01:29:23.811 --> 01:29:25.192]  If you're going to come into the party— Exactly!
[01:29:25.232 --> 01:29:29.375]  We need Americans for freedom and security and prosperity!
[01:29:30.435 --> 01:29:30.816]  That's it.
[01:29:30.916 --> 01:29:33.117]  We need to start the initiative.
[01:29:33.712 --> 01:29:34.793]  And let me expand on that.
[01:29:34.813 --> 01:29:37.776]  I've spoken to groups that are mainly Hispanic, white, or black.
[01:29:38.196 --> 01:29:38.696]  I'm invited to.
[01:29:38.716 --> 01:29:42.400]  I don't sit there and patronize whites and talk about what I'm going to do for whites.
[01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:44.902]  Or I don't talk to a black crowd that's, you know, mainly, I said, how about black people?
[01:29:44.922 --> 01:29:46.363]  That's what Democrats, I don't, they're just people.
[01:30:00.515 --> 01:30:10.278]  They're just people that I'm going to promote Second Amendment, free speech, security, prosperity, jobs, factories, farming, our children, education.
[01:30:11.479 --> 01:30:17.941]  If I was a white guy and some black speaker came and told me about how great white people were, I think that was weird.
[01:30:18.801 --> 01:30:21.202]  I don't want to hear about how I'm black or white.
[01:30:21.242 --> 01:30:22.562]  I want to hear about issues, right?
[01:30:24.343 --> 01:30:25.343]  It's extremely weird.
[01:30:25.623 --> 01:30:27.644]  And what that does within the party is
[01:30:28.473 --> 01:30:34.217]  It sees power to people that are there who have an agenda outside of just being an American.
[01:30:34.497 --> 01:30:35.598]  Because that's who we are.
[01:30:35.999 --> 01:30:37.900]  And what you'll see start to happen, Alex, is...
[01:30:38.678 --> 01:30:41.919]  I've already said black people have been screwed over, so give them a tax break!
[01:30:41.939 --> 01:30:42.259]  Incentivize!
[01:31:03.305 --> 01:31:11.147]  Yeah, there are plenty of benefits of coming into the party instead of just being coming in and be in some type of subgroup.
[01:31:11.347 --> 01:31:12.467]  What's the point of all of that?
[01:31:13.008 --> 01:31:14.848]  It's just pure stupidity.
[01:31:15.248 --> 01:31:16.328]  It's very divisive.
[01:31:16.869 --> 01:31:21.930]  And it makes us play into the game, just like you're saying that the Democrats play.
[01:31:22.572 --> 01:31:24.893]  You're a really smart caller, so I'm going to shut up.
[01:31:24.913 --> 01:31:26.434]  I'm going to shut up for like four minutes.
[01:31:26.854 --> 01:31:27.774]  You've got the floor, Antonio.
[01:31:27.794 --> 01:31:29.275]  I was interrupted five times agreeing with you.
[01:31:29.555 --> 01:31:37.239]  What is your message to that last caller who thinks we can placate this when it's the Democrat social engineers controlling it?
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:38.960]  Right.
[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:44.502]  So my answer to that would be, look, we don't have to give that no attention.
[01:31:44.862 --> 01:31:48.384]  You know, you don't have to prove anything as an American.
[01:31:48.789 --> 01:32:02.741]  You know, I've seen people, I've seen black people coming to the Republican Party here in Gwinnett County, and the way that they move is like they treat the white people and other people like they owe them something as a black person.
[01:32:02.821 --> 01:32:03.942]  It's completely divisive.
[01:32:04.362 --> 01:32:05.844]  I'm completely against that.
[01:32:06.164 --> 01:32:07.405]  We're all going to be American.
[01:32:07.904 --> 01:32:08.824]  That's who we are.
[01:32:09.164 --> 01:32:10.205]  We don't owe anybody.
[01:32:10.305 --> 01:32:15.906]  I've never been a slave, and Alex, I don't think you've ever owned one, so we don't owe anything to each other.
[01:32:16.066 --> 01:32:21.347]  We need to come together and fight for this country right now, and that's what it should be all about 24-7.
[01:32:23.668 --> 01:32:26.849]  And what I wanted to talk to you today about, Alex, is
[01:32:28.037 --> 01:32:29.418]  Four points, and I know we got to move.
[01:32:29.438 --> 01:32:32.319]  No, no, you got the floor, brother, because I was going to get to this.
[01:32:32.619 --> 01:32:37.481]  They had all the Democrats, white dudes for Harris, come out and tell white people, you're bad.
[01:32:37.802 --> 01:32:40.023]  You got to vote for her to prove you're not racist.
[01:32:40.063 --> 01:32:41.143]  She's not even black.
[01:32:41.563 --> 01:32:47.606]  But plus, like the guilt, like, do what we say, bomb Russia or you're racist.
[01:32:48.046 --> 01:32:48.807]  It's a joke.
[01:32:50.067 --> 01:32:52.048]  Yeah, it's all to put the person.
[01:32:52.188 --> 01:32:54.289]  This whole thing is about power.
[01:32:54.849 --> 01:32:56.350]  It's not about the person.
[01:32:57.094 --> 01:33:00.435]  It's simple.
[01:33:01.095 --> 01:33:08.017]  Look at the corporations.
[01:33:08.037 --> 01:33:09.998]  They've stolen the identity of black people.
[01:33:10.138 --> 01:33:11.218]  All the Fortune 500.
[01:33:11.619 --> 01:33:13.099]  Every spokesperson's a black person.
[01:33:13.319 --> 01:33:16.980]  They're stealing black people's identity and saying, you don't like corporations?
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.701]  Well, we're black now, which they're not.
[01:33:19.101 --> 01:33:21.101]  And so do whatever we say or you're racist.
[01:33:21.141 --> 01:33:22.202]  That's so transparent.
[01:33:22.842 --> 01:33:23.442]  But make your point.
[01:33:23.462 --> 01:33:25.663]  I interrupted 10 times, but you said you wanted to make a point.
[01:33:25.683 --> 01:33:26.103]  Go ahead.
[01:33:26.921 --> 01:33:27.722]  Yeah, it is.
[01:33:27.742 --> 01:33:29.402]  And one more thing before we get to my point.
[01:33:29.723 --> 01:33:40.028]  I think it's a slap in the face for any race of people who work hard to be in position for people to put them up and prop up people as a, you know, in some diversity hierarchy.
[01:33:40.428 --> 01:33:45.551]  Come on, you know, we know you can't make it across the line, so let me put you up here because you're black.
[01:33:45.911 --> 01:33:50.654]  But people like you and I, we know that that's the play into the narrative that they're trying to push forward.
[01:33:51.175 --> 01:33:51.935]  That's all it's for.
[01:33:51.955 --> 01:33:52.255]  It is, Alex.
[01:33:52.435 --> 01:33:53.776]  And it's because all they need is a laugh.
[01:33:53.856 --> 01:33:55.076]  A laugh like putting a quarter in the
[01:34:14.491 --> 01:34:15.991]  In the slot machine for them.
[01:34:16.352 --> 01:34:18.892]  And every lie that they tell, they just need another quarter.
[01:34:18.932 --> 01:34:20.873]  They don't care if it's true or not.
[01:34:20.893 --> 01:34:22.794]  They don't care if Kamala Harris is black.
[01:34:22.854 --> 01:34:25.034]  They know that black people will go out here and vote for her.
[01:34:25.054 --> 01:34:27.515]  And that's going to tie in great to the four points I want to make.
[01:34:28.255 --> 01:34:31.876]  Point number one, the New World Order is losing, right?
[01:34:32.516 --> 01:34:40.639]  Elon Musk and many other people have come out to talk about the stuff that's going on down here, what's going on south of the border.
[01:34:42.125 --> 01:34:53.131]  Many of leaders that's in different countries down there have said that they won't recognize Maduro as the legitimate leader, and they have stolen an election down there.
[01:34:53.592 --> 01:34:59.775]  The New World Order and the globalists that are in our country, they're going to have a big problem on their hands in November.
[01:35:00.336 --> 01:35:05.159]  Because what you're seeing is you're seeing a populist uprising, and they have set the
[01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:12.654]  For what's going on with the machines and everything that's going on in our country.
[01:35:13.075 --> 01:35:28.227]  Number two, the elections are the railhead of everything that the fight is going to be about because it determines whether our tyranny continues to roll on and we have a free country or not, or if we're able to remove these people or not.
[01:35:29.248 --> 01:35:29.768]  Number three,
[01:35:31.693 --> 01:35:32.554]  The assassination.
[01:35:32.774 --> 01:35:36.176]  You predicted that they would try to attempt on Trump's life.
[01:35:36.756 --> 01:35:37.177]  It happened.
[01:35:37.497 --> 01:35:39.878]  You also predicted that Biden would be removed.
[01:35:40.439 --> 01:35:41.840]  That happened to the date.
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:49.284]  Now, I'm a strong believer that assassination is not off the table, even for their side.
[01:35:49.785 --> 01:35:50.885]  They're the party of death.
[01:35:51.646 --> 01:35:57.510]  They will sacrifice one of their own to create another George Floyd moment, in my opinion.
[01:35:57.790 --> 01:36:01.032]  I don't think them going after Harris is off the table, Alex.
[01:36:01.573 --> 01:36:14.757]  Because right now, they need the fuel that's going to burn through this election to activate these false flags and these sleeper cells that they've allowed across our southern border.
[01:36:15.237 --> 01:36:16.858]  What better way to do it than that?
[01:36:17.358 --> 01:36:20.979]  And then standing in the shadows, in my opinion, is Big Mike.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:23.220]  Now, Democrats play to win.
[01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:24.701]  So just think about this.
[01:36:25.221 --> 01:36:28.882]  So they've tried to remove Trump from the ballot.
[01:36:29.614 --> 01:36:35.019]  They got him tied up in court, you know, all kinds of things.
[01:36:35.279 --> 01:36:37.181]  They tried to kill, assassinate him.
[01:36:37.822 --> 01:36:43.407]  So now the globalists in our country are going to come together and say, let's put up Kamala Harris?
[01:36:44.201 --> 01:36:45.362]  That don't even make sense.
[01:36:45.743 --> 01:36:46.643]  They play to win.
[01:36:46.824 --> 01:36:49.446]  All of this, in my opinion, is a misdirection play.
[01:36:49.787 --> 01:36:50.587]  I totally agree.
[01:36:50.647 --> 01:36:52.970]  In fact, Roger wasn't ready to come on last week.
[01:36:53.010 --> 01:36:54.111]  That's what he's probably telling me.
[01:36:54.131 --> 01:36:58.075]  And exactly, they need to kill her or Biden to play victim.
[01:36:58.095 --> 01:36:59.797]  I think you're dead on.
[01:37:00.858 --> 01:37:04.801]  Yeah, so my prediction is if they'll kill her,
[01:37:07.109 --> 01:37:15.694]  And they'll be this big uprising, activate the terrorist cells because they probably was going to stage a false flag with Trump and it was God's providence.
[01:37:16.055 --> 01:37:20.157]  It was the grace of God that they missed and they protected Trump's life.
[01:37:20.938 --> 01:37:27.882]  And they would have said some right wing extremists came out and went after Biden and killed him or something like this.
[01:37:27.942 --> 01:37:30.403]  And now we got civil unrest going on.
[01:37:31.104 --> 01:37:34.566]  So Michelle Obama will be the pick, in my opinion.
[01:37:34.606 --> 01:37:36.547]  I'm on the mind frame of Roger Stone.
[01:37:37.466 --> 01:37:41.688]  And it's because they need a for sure shot, okay?
[01:37:41.768 --> 01:37:42.529]  They play to win.
[01:37:43.069 --> 01:37:44.690]  They need narratives right now.
[01:37:45.330 --> 01:37:49.773]  And the narrative that will fuel, they just need another lie to keep telling, right?
[01:37:50.093 --> 01:37:59.078]  So if they go after Kamala and kill her or whatever, this will create fuel for the news media all over again to fuel their base, okay?
[01:37:59.178 --> 01:38:02.800]  They move off of emotional fuel and they need that, okay?
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:06.342]  When they lie and try to steal it again and or steal it,
[01:38:06.952 --> 01:38:09.953]  Michelle Obama will be believable for two reasons.
[01:38:10.834 --> 01:38:19.178]  If you notice, in the recent past, all of the networks have been promoting that, oh yeah, Trump has the black male vote.
[01:38:19.738 --> 01:38:20.378]  Every one of them.
[01:38:20.418 --> 01:38:22.159]  Fox News, CNN, all of that.
[01:38:22.179 --> 01:38:29.763]  But what they haven't said is, he does not have the white suburban woman vote and the black female vote.
[01:38:30.330 --> 01:38:45.514]  They'll lie and say that the reason Michelle Obama won, which I believe she will be the final candidate because they play to win, and for another reason I believe they'll pick Michelle Obama, Alex is, she is the closest person to Barack Obama.
[01:38:45.854 --> 01:38:47.955]  Now before, they had a no-brain in Biden.
[01:38:48.435 --> 01:38:48.755]  Okay?
[01:38:48.775 --> 01:38:51.275]  With Kamala Harris, they have a bird brain.
[01:38:51.616 --> 01:38:53.256]  So I gave my wife this scenario.
[01:38:53.940 --> 01:39:07.002]  If we were in a car and the car was going off the cliff, right, and you're in the passenger seat, would you want to have somebody without an opinion or somebody who has not an opinion going off this cliff?
[01:39:07.463 --> 01:39:09.823]  I would say the person without the opinion.
[01:39:10.103 --> 01:39:12.784]  So, they have a bird brain in Kamala.
[01:39:12.904 --> 01:39:17.725]  She may hit the gas instead of the brakes when they tell, because the lady's completely incompetent.
[01:39:17.745 --> 01:39:19.965]  She's corrupt, but she's incompetent.
[01:39:20.484 --> 01:39:28.690]  So, all the New World Order needs right now to lose Alex, in my opinion, is to be off just a degree or two.
[01:39:29.631 --> 01:39:30.191]  And they lose.
[01:39:30.972 --> 01:39:34.034]  So that ace in the hole is Michelle Obama.
[01:39:34.955 --> 01:39:38.998]  Well, all I gotta say is, Antonio, we've had a lot of great callers, but you're one of the best in the last year.
[01:39:39.078 --> 01:39:44.402]  You're saying everything I think, but done a better job condensing it, because I take hours to explain this stuff.
[01:39:44.783 --> 01:39:46.884]  You are saying exactly what I see happening.
[01:39:47.665 --> 01:39:47.785]  And...
[01:39:49.793 --> 01:39:50.914]  So let me ask you the next question.
[01:39:51.294 --> 01:39:54.015]  Finish your points, and then how do we stop it?
[01:39:54.155 --> 01:39:54.676]  What do we do?
[01:39:56.637 --> 01:39:57.677]  This is what we have to do.
[01:39:58.178 --> 01:40:01.139]  Thank you for what you do again, Alex.
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.560]  You have inspired me.
[01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:05.422]  Steve Bannon's War Room has inspired me.
[01:40:06.102 --> 01:40:11.245]  I started a podcast in Georgia because I know... I was about to ask you, man.
[01:40:11.285 --> 01:40:13.746]  I hope you got some media because I'm going to tune in.
[01:40:13.927 --> 01:40:14.507]  How do we find it?
[01:40:15.897 --> 01:40:18.178]  Listen, War Room, Gwinnett County.
[01:40:18.318 --> 01:40:23.459]  If you put in War Room, Gwinnett County on Facebook, everywhere on X, we stream live.
[01:40:23.799 --> 01:40:27.139]  It's crowdsourced.
[01:40:27.159 --> 01:40:30.860]  How would you like to host the fourth hour sometime this week?
[01:40:33.281 --> 01:40:33.901]  That'll be great.
[01:40:34.641 --> 01:40:35.741]  That'll be excellent.
[01:40:35.981 --> 01:40:36.801]  We can set that up.
[01:40:37.701 --> 01:40:38.222]  It's done.
[01:40:38.342 --> 01:40:39.062]  So keep going.
[01:40:40.836 --> 01:40:50.646]  Listen, in Georgia, there is a uniparty establishment in our GOP, and we're getting ready to expose and pull the mask off some of these people.
[01:40:51.006 --> 01:40:51.827]  This is important.
[01:40:52.308 --> 01:41:01.597]  It's my theory of the case is that there were some people at this convention, I don't know any names, in the GOP convention, or RNC, who expected Trump to die.
[01:41:01.963 --> 01:41:02.183]  Yep.
[01:41:02.423 --> 01:41:02.863]  Before.
[01:41:03.143 --> 01:41:03.384]  Oh yeah.
[01:41:03.444 --> 01:41:06.125]  And they had their people teed up.
[01:41:06.185 --> 01:41:12.847]  We've had many fights that have gone on in the Georgia GOP about who was really MAGA and who was not.
[01:41:13.507 --> 01:41:18.149]  And I know that there's a disconnect from the true grassroots people.
[01:41:18.889 --> 01:41:20.910]  I'm connected to a few of them.
[01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:27.973]  So we've got to do a better job at getting the true grassroots connected to the Trump campaign.
[01:41:29.648 --> 01:41:32.470]  They will sell him out in a New York minute.
[01:41:32.490 --> 01:41:33.471]  They will sell him out.
[01:41:33.491 --> 01:41:36.614]  They get mad at Trump because he puts some bad people in.
[01:41:37.034 --> 01:41:39.776]  If my whole crew wasn't behind me with 45 people, I couldn't do it.
[01:41:40.237 --> 01:41:41.558]  Trump has millions under him.
[01:41:41.618 --> 01:41:42.659]  How the hell is he supposed to know?
[01:41:42.979 --> 01:41:45.821]  We've got to be on the ground telegraphing who's real and who's not.
[01:41:46.442 --> 01:41:47.763]  We have to be the eyes and ears.
[01:41:49.104 --> 01:41:54.246]  Yeah, so two more things before we get to my podcast.
[01:41:54.947 --> 01:41:58.749]  Before you had me come on, the guys, you were talking about the farmland and everything.
[01:41:59.069 --> 01:42:03.711]  Here's another way the New World Order is doing it, and I'm seeing it unfold right here in my county.
[01:42:03.731 --> 01:42:07.253]  And this all speaks into elections, and I'll show you how this ties in.
[01:42:08.513 --> 01:42:09.834]  So here in Gwinnett County,
[01:42:10.555 --> 01:42:12.859]  Oh, the globalists always target the conservative winning areas.
[01:42:27.028 --> 01:42:39.192]  Yeah, so they've done this Alex because if you've got two Fulton County, which Gwinnett is like in the middle teetering on whether it's going to be Fulton County or not, just because of the demographic that they're bringing in.
[01:42:39.212 --> 01:42:46.894]  And this is why the work that you do, the work that I'm trying to do on the ground and many other fighters that's here in Georgia to get the message out.
[01:42:46.914 --> 01:42:48.775]  And this is why they want to shut down free speech.
[01:42:49.155 --> 01:42:52.576]  And they tried to bankrupt you and take everything that you have is because
[01:42:53.479 --> 01:43:00.242]  If we can get the conversion happening, we can change, we can put the ideas in front of the people, just like you said earlier.
[01:43:00.702 --> 01:43:09.485]  And our power is going to be in the conversion process, because what they've done is they've made it hard for farmers right up here in this county.
[01:43:10.066 --> 01:43:14.847]  And, you know, they're selling their land off to big developers.
[01:43:15.168 --> 01:43:19.349]  They're putting in these high density New World Order houses, in my view.
[01:43:19.489 --> 01:43:21.390]  Every third house looks like the first house.
[01:43:21.843 --> 01:43:34.907]  They're saying they're for a good green planet and all of this, but they're cutting down all of these trees when they don't have to, just flattening the area and building cheap houses.
[01:43:35.207 --> 01:43:37.148]  I see the demographic coming in.
[01:43:37.188 --> 01:43:38.928]  The demographic is changing.
[01:43:39.288 --> 01:43:42.870]  So their goal is to have two Atlantas.
[01:43:43.410 --> 01:43:48.631]  Gwinnett is going to be the second Atlanta in their mind if we don't fight this.
[01:43:48.951 --> 01:43:50.412]  And they'll always be able to say,
[01:43:51.249 --> 01:43:59.992]  Well, we can't win Georgia because if you can't win Fulton County and Gwinnett County, you're not going to be able to win the state.
[01:44:00.892 --> 01:44:11.275]  And so that's why I started War Room Gwinnett after watching Steve Bannon, after I saw the 2020 election stole, which the first time that I voted for Trump and my vote was stolen.
[01:44:11.976 --> 01:44:14.296]  I went online looking for truth, looking for answers.
[01:44:14.616 --> 01:44:17.497]  And Steve Bannon's War Room was one of the ones that I came across.
[01:44:17.557 --> 01:44:19.618]  And I learned so much about geopolitics,
[01:44:20.791 --> 01:44:21.692]  Action, action, action.
[01:44:21.732 --> 01:44:23.513]  What do you do to get involved?
[01:44:23.793 --> 01:44:25.674]  You know, this is our country.
[01:44:25.734 --> 01:44:26.635]  We should fight for it.
[01:44:27.095 --> 01:44:29.157]  And the information, it just armed me.
[01:44:29.177 --> 01:44:34.440]  So I was like, maybe we should do that here locally in the county and try to save this county.
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:35.080]  It's beautiful.
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:36.681]  And it is going to be local that does it.
[01:44:36.741 --> 01:44:37.021]  All right.
[01:44:37.061 --> 01:44:37.742]  Thanks for the time.
[01:44:38.402 --> 01:44:39.283]  Host the 4th Hour.
[01:44:39.323 --> 01:44:40.263]  We'll get your name and number.
[01:44:40.344 --> 01:44:41.104]  We put your thing up.
[01:44:41.164 --> 01:44:41.644]  We love you.
[01:44:41.684 --> 01:44:42.205]  Great points.
[01:44:42.265 --> 01:44:43.125]  Antonio, thank you.
[01:44:43.786 --> 01:44:44.046]  Wow.
[01:44:44.646 --> 01:44:47.328]  I don't usually spend 15 minutes with a caller, but that guy is on fire.
[01:44:51.618 --> 01:44:52.858]  Nigeria.
[01:44:55.619 --> 01:44:57.440]  Nigeria and Texas.
[01:44:57.460 --> 01:44:58.420]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:44:58.760]  Go ahead.
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:00.021]  Hi.
[01:45:00.081 --> 01:45:00.881]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:45:01.421 --> 01:45:03.342]  I've heard about you from my man.
[01:45:03.382 --> 01:45:05.502]  We've been knowing each other for four years.
[01:45:05.562 --> 01:45:08.783]  He's a big fan of yours and he buys your vitamins.
[01:45:08.943 --> 01:45:10.084]  So thank you so much.
[01:45:10.244 --> 01:45:10.504]  Thank you.
[01:45:12.206 --> 01:45:16.869]  What I want to hit today was the 5G towers.
[01:45:17.089 --> 01:45:22.192]  I feel like that is definitely a weapon used in the military.
[01:45:22.212 --> 01:45:25.914]  There's no doubt they're super toxic, super bad.
[01:45:27.234 --> 01:45:32.597]  Yes, it gives off a lot of radiation and it's really harmful.
[01:45:32.957 --> 01:45:39.661]  But the reason why I say that is because last year, me and my man went to Las Vegas
[01:45:40.413 --> 01:45:44.095]  And there is a 5G tower covered with military leaves.
[01:45:47.556 --> 01:45:55.039]  So, I do have a picture and I do have a video of that, but... You're saying it was camouflaged?
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:56.340]  Yes.
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:57.260]  Perfect.
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:58.121]  Right there.
[01:45:58.141 --> 01:46:01.202]  They aesthetically, you know, do that because they don't want you to know the stuff's everywhere, yeah?
[01:46:02.316 --> 01:46:04.999]  Yes, so I just wanted to say that.
[01:46:06.681 --> 01:46:13.009]  I was out in Northern California a few weeks ago and there's these giant cell towers that make them look like fir trees or redwoods.
[01:46:14.050 --> 01:46:14.391]  Wow.
[01:46:14.911 --> 01:46:16.693]  Yeah, that's not cool.
[01:46:16.713 --> 01:46:20.198]  I also think it's powering AI.
[01:46:21.735 --> 01:46:26.179]  Well yeah, they want AI to control the self-driving cars and all, that's one of the bad things Elon's doing.
[01:46:26.459 --> 01:46:31.984]  And again, it's innovation, he wants that, but the 5G's going in so the AI cars can replace us.
[01:46:32.564 --> 01:46:37.488]  We'll just by choice not support the AI cars, not ride the self-driving cars, not be part of it.
[01:46:38.669 --> 01:46:44.414]  Yes, and Las Vegas has an underground tunnel for Tesla.
[01:46:45.825 --> 01:46:50.388]  What they're doing down there, I don't know, but I think it's not a cool idea to build an underground tunnel.
[01:46:50.428 --> 01:46:52.090]  Well, there's nothing wrong in my view.
[01:46:52.350 --> 01:46:54.251]  That's exactly what I saw in Northern California with TV viewers.
[01:46:55.212 --> 01:46:57.694]  I'm not against, you know, self-driving cars for whatever reason.
[01:46:58.154 --> 01:46:59.535]  They try to force us to do it.
[01:47:00.055 --> 01:47:00.836]  That is the issue.
[01:47:00.936 --> 01:47:01.997]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:47:03.137 --> 01:47:12.265]  All right, Ashley in Pennsylvania, we're going to break, come back with you, get to a few more, and then this huge economist with major breaking news is going to be joining us.
[01:47:12.405 --> 01:47:13.286]  So stay with us.
[01:47:13.907 --> 01:47:20.873]  Briefly, you heard the caller earlier from Georgia talk about how great rocket rest is, an amazing sleep aid.
[01:47:21.393 --> 01:47:22.434]  You say, well, what's better?
[01:47:22.534 --> 01:47:22.994]  You know, the
[01:47:23.635 --> 01:47:24.376]  We're good to go.
[01:47:24.396 --> 01:47:24.956]  We're good to go.
[01:47:24.976 --> 01:47:25.436]  We're good to go.
[01:47:42.768 --> 01:47:44.390]  Great energy with no letdown.
[01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:49.815]  Next level foundational energy selling out at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:47:49.955 --> 01:47:53.339]  So please support our sponsor drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:47:54.079 --> 01:47:59.865]  The concentrated green fiber, the rocket rest, the carbon shell, the multivitamin, it's all there.
[01:48:00.726 --> 01:48:02.228]  We've seen a lot of people
[01:48:04.161 --> 01:48:13.044]  And a lot of corporate media and a lot of pundits, and I see a lot, thousands of articles, the last month saying info wars will imminently be shut down.
[01:48:14.585 --> 01:48:21.327]  And they panicked with a federally appointed CRO and federally appointed U.S.
[01:48:21.367 --> 01:48:26.449]  trustee from the Justice Department, and five weeks ago ordered this place shut without a court order.
[01:48:27.745 --> 01:48:31.488]  The judge excoriated them, fired them three weeks ago.
[01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:39.454]  Then two weeks ago, the Democrat Party lawyers that use the Sandy Hook parents as a front group came in and said, we want him shut down today.
[01:48:39.855 --> 01:48:41.096]  The judge shut that down.
[01:48:41.676 --> 01:48:45.399]  Then they tried to grab Infowars a week and a half ago at the state court.
[01:48:45.479 --> 01:48:47.301]  The judge said, that's illegal and shut that down.
[01:48:47.541 --> 01:48:48.161]  This is epic.
[01:48:48.642 --> 01:48:50.043]  People say, how is this continuing on?
[01:48:50.083 --> 01:48:51.004]  Because we're fighting.
[01:48:51.564 --> 01:48:52.425]  We're not giving up.
[01:48:52.445 --> 01:48:53.166]  You're praying.
[01:48:53.866 --> 01:48:59.589]  But I love how five weeks ago I told you this happened, and like, oh yeah, they came out in order to shut it down, and you stood up to them and all this.
[01:48:59.609 --> 01:49:00.229]  Where's the video?
[01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:02.010]  You want on top of that video?
[01:49:02.371 --> 01:49:03.071]  Confronting people?
[01:49:03.431 --> 01:49:04.252]  This is serious.
[01:49:04.292 --> 01:49:05.192]  I've tried to non-escalate.
[01:49:06.273 --> 01:49:07.413]  Now it's all in the court record.
[01:49:07.633 --> 01:49:08.334]  Of course it's true.
[01:49:08.354 --> 01:49:09.434]  Of course I didn't make this up.
[01:49:09.474 --> 01:49:10.235]  I don't cry wolf.
[01:49:11.275 --> 01:49:17.979]  So, we are surrounded by wolves, but we've got God on our side, and we've got the people that love God supporting us.
[01:49:18.019 --> 01:49:23.122]  So, I need all of you to understand that we're still here for at least three months.
[01:49:24.295 --> 01:49:30.358]  But if people think we're not going to be here and don't support InfoWarsTore.com with great sales and great products, we'll shut down by extension.
[01:49:30.399 --> 01:49:30.999]  That's been happening.
[01:49:31.259 --> 01:49:32.280]  People aren't buying stuff.
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:34.861]  Even though we're selling all the products, it's gone away.
[01:49:34.941 --> 01:49:35.942]  Do they think we're about to be shut down?
[01:49:36.002 --> 01:49:36.142]  No.
[01:49:36.502 --> 01:49:37.663]  You order something, you get it.
[01:49:38.023 --> 01:49:45.327]  And so it'll be you that decides to shut us down if you don't go there and get X2 and X3 and Vitamineral Fusion about to sell it and all of it.
[01:49:45.767 --> 01:49:48.109]  But what I want to talk to you about is a fundraiser.
[01:49:48.809 --> 01:49:57.016]  We have a couple thousand copies of the number one worldwide bestseller, The Great Awakening, The Plan to Defeat the Globalists and Launch the Next Great Renaissance.
[01:49:57.576 --> 01:49:58.857]  Huge, thick book I wrote.
[01:49:59.378 --> 01:50:00.739]  Just came out six, eight months ago.
[01:50:00.759 --> 01:50:04.602]  There are a few thousand signed copies left, and it is a fundraiser.
[01:50:05.083 --> 01:50:08.866]  I want to thank those of you that got a signed copy, but I want to encourage all of you
[01:50:10.489 --> 01:50:19.971]  That have not gotten a signed copy and you want a chance to support the broadcast and know that at the critical juncture you fought to get the funds in to keep operating because we're right on the edge of the red and the black.
[01:50:21.111 --> 01:50:27.653]  To go now to infowarsstore.com and get The Great Awakening today.
[01:50:27.713 --> 01:50:32.054]  And there's almost 3,000 copies left of this signed, 1,000 copies unsigned.
[01:50:32.974 --> 01:50:36.935]  There's also about 700 copies of The Great Reset, the predecessor book to this.
[01:50:39.102 --> 01:50:42.603]  And unless we get a buyer and things change and, you know, whatever, we'll be shut down in a few months.
[01:50:42.643 --> 01:50:45.264]  But we will probably continue on.
[01:50:45.324 --> 01:50:46.384]  God's hand is on us.
[01:50:46.424 --> 01:50:47.245]  The force is with us.
[01:50:48.105 --> 01:50:49.285]  Please go now.
[01:50:49.545 --> 01:50:57.268]  It's in stock, ready to ship at infowarestore.com and get The Great Awakening, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:57.848 --> 01:51:00.409]  Defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[01:51:00.529 --> 01:51:03.950]  And when these signed copies are gone here, they're going to be gone.
[01:51:04.010 --> 01:51:06.351]  I'm going to sign this right now.
[01:51:09.055 --> 01:51:14.641]  2024.
[01:51:09.296 --> 01:51:14.641]  And I thank you for everything you do to support us.
[01:51:14.701 --> 01:51:16.123]  And this will be put in the warehouse.
[01:51:16.503 --> 01:51:18.886]  Somebody will get this book.
[01:51:19.426 --> 01:51:20.787]  Put a little something extra on there.
[01:51:20.807 --> 01:51:23.350]  All right.
[01:51:23.410 --> 01:51:25.552]  So, I appreciate you.
[01:51:25.672 --> 01:51:30.658]  Get The Great Awakening, Defeating the Globalists, and Launching the Next Great Renaissance.
[01:51:32.005 --> 01:51:40.307]  With myself, Alex Jones, Ken Heckenleibig, I'll put it together with a foreword by Stephen K. Bannon, who's a political prisoner right now in Connecticut in jail.
[01:51:41.107 --> 01:51:42.908]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:51:42.948 --> 01:51:43.908]  We're betting on you.
[01:51:44.248 --> 01:51:45.348]  We believe on you.
[01:51:45.668 --> 01:51:47.509]  But we cannot do this without your support.
[01:51:47.949 --> 01:51:48.549]  Get a copy.

[01:51:50.069 --> 01:51:52.910]  The last copies at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:55.091]  And I humbly thank you all for your support.
[01:51:55.151 --> 01:51:56.411]  Now, please take action.
[01:52:00.407 --> 01:52:06.912]  We're all living the great adventure of consciousness on this beautiful planet, hurtling through space around that gorgeous sun.
[01:52:09.594 --> 01:52:10.956]  So you see these evil globalists?
[01:52:10.976 --> 01:52:12.677]  Just remember, they're just people.
[01:52:13.237 --> 01:52:13.918]  They're going down.
[01:52:13.938 --> 01:52:21.544]  Incredible economist and expert on what's happening in the world, Martin Armstrong, coming up.
[01:52:22.425 --> 01:52:26.048]  Right now, as she's having a few more calls, Ashley in Pennsylvania.
[01:52:26.068 --> 01:52:27.089]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:52:29.505 --> 01:52:30.986]  Good to talk to you.
[01:52:31.466 --> 01:52:39.529]  The reason that I'm calling is you guys are talking about the food shortage, but we don't have a shortage of fentanyl or COVID shots.
[01:52:41.389 --> 01:52:42.250]  I've been sober.
[01:52:42.290 --> 01:52:53.034]  I got clean from fentanyl, and then I took one dose of the Pfizer shot, and now my left atrium is enlarged.
[01:52:53.394 --> 01:52:57.736]  They're taking out an entire generation, my generation.
[01:52:59.466 --> 01:53:00.587]  It sucks to watch it.
[01:53:01.887 --> 01:53:08.030]  And what I was going to ask you is what, I mean, what do you think Trump is going to do about it when he gets in office?
[01:53:08.230 --> 01:53:11.731]  Well, that's the worst thing about Trump is that he went around with warp speed.
[01:53:13.012 --> 01:53:15.653]  And 35 million people are dead worldwide.
[01:53:15.713 --> 01:53:20.095]  Trump, in that private call with JFK Jr., admitted that it's hurting children.
[01:53:21.115 --> 01:53:24.997]  He knows if he comes out publicly, they'll use it against him, but he's definitely backed off the shots.
[01:53:25.037 --> 01:53:34.743]  He wasn't 10% as bad as Biden, and somehow a lesser-to-evils guy, but obviously future lockdowns and poison shots are off the table with a new Trump.
[01:53:34.783 --> 01:53:37.925]  If he goes for it, I'll be totally against him, but I'm telling you, that's not going to happen.
[01:53:39.266 --> 01:53:41.287]  But I mean, I saw numbers this week that just came out.
[01:53:41.868 --> 01:53:44.849]  This is bigger than World War II.
[01:53:45.310 --> 01:53:47.371]  The death levels we've seen so far, it's insane.
[01:53:49.449 --> 01:53:50.070]  Absolutely.
[01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:54.453]  And the fentanyl crisis, like I said, that's taking out even more, you know.
[01:53:54.633 --> 01:54:01.879]  And do we have the actual numbers of the COVID shot damage and the fentanyl, you know, the loss of life?
[01:54:01.919 --> 01:54:03.860]  We have the insurance company numbers.
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:05.582]  We have the insurance company numbers.
[01:54:07.052 --> 01:54:08.874]  On the dead.
[01:54:08.934 --> 01:54:10.094]  It's over 25 million.
[01:54:10.114 --> 01:54:11.215]  That's a conservative number.
[01:54:11.375 --> 01:54:12.056]  35 million is a high number.
[01:54:12.076 --> 01:54:13.857]  I mean, they knew what this was.
[01:54:13.897 --> 01:54:20.602]  The CDC, FDA's own document that came out in October 2020 predicted that what was going to happen, so they knew.
[01:54:22.184 --> 01:54:22.384]  Yeah.
[01:54:22.664 --> 01:54:24.626]  I'm sorry to hear about your heart.
[01:54:25.086 --> 01:54:26.147]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:26.407 --> 01:54:35.634]  Our kids just, I'm so worried about my children's futures, you know, with all these shots and all their pressure of transgender and just everything.
[01:54:36.147 --> 01:54:37.867]  You know, it's very concerning.
[01:54:37.908 --> 01:54:38.928]  We're in a war.
[01:54:38.968 --> 01:54:42.649]  We're in a depopulation war headed up by Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab.
[01:54:42.669 --> 01:54:45.029]  But the good news is the world is waking up.
[01:54:47.370 --> 01:54:51.111]  Yeah, I hope some of us wake up a little bit faster.
[01:54:52.191 --> 01:54:54.912]  I also wanted to plug your products, Nitric Boost.
[01:54:55.012 --> 01:54:57.693]  That gives me such a boost of energy.
[01:54:57.973 --> 01:55:02.374]  And I also just got the X2.
[01:55:02.394 --> 01:55:04.215]  I love the iodine.
[01:55:04.395 --> 01:55:05.215]  It works amazing.
[01:55:05.908 --> 01:55:11.836]  And the energy, the foundational energy, that stuff is amazing.
[01:55:12.677 --> 01:55:14.619]  They're all amazing products, but we couldn't be here without you.
[01:55:14.679 --> 01:55:17.983]  It takes people to fund an InfoWar, and I salute you and thank you, Ashley.
[01:55:18.484 --> 01:55:19.205]  Alright, Trina.
[01:55:20.370 --> 01:55:22.292]  Dog them, Dan, Kelly, Casey.
[01:55:22.652 --> 01:55:23.853]  You can hold until the guest is gone.
[01:55:23.893 --> 01:55:25.515]  I'll go to you, or you can leave.
[01:55:25.555 --> 01:55:26.015]  I'm sorry.
[01:55:26.275 --> 01:55:28.497]  It took a lot of calls, but we ran out of time.
[01:55:28.537 --> 01:55:31.540]  If you want to hold, I'll go to you after our guest leaves us in like 55 minutes.
[01:55:32.061 --> 01:55:32.761]  If not, you can go.
[01:55:32.781 --> 01:55:33.422]  I understand that.
[01:55:33.442 --> 01:55:34.242]  We appreciate you.
[01:55:34.262 --> 01:55:34.903]  We honor you.
[01:55:34.943 --> 01:55:35.924]  We appreciate you tuning in.
[01:55:36.264 --> 01:55:37.605]  We appreciate you participating.
[01:55:38.473 --> 01:55:43.815]  All right, Martin Armstrong is an amazing, groundbreaking economist going back the last 30, 40 years.
[01:55:44.375 --> 01:55:47.876]  He's been a guest in the last decade or, well, 20 years a few times.
[01:55:48.456 --> 01:55:51.137]  He has accurately predicted basically everything that's now happening.
[01:55:52.537 --> 01:55:55.798]  I tried to read his bio, it would take an hour to do, so I'm not going to do that.
[01:55:55.898 --> 01:56:00.619]  We're going to go on a break for 60 seconds, join over 300 radio stations that don't carry the first five minutes.
[01:56:01.099 --> 01:56:02.700]  We're going to write to Martin Armstrong about
[01:56:03.766 --> 01:56:08.332]  The election, the economy, what's happening in the world, Venezuela.
[01:56:08.632 --> 01:56:13.157]  He'll have the floor when we come back in T-minus 60 seconds.
[01:56:13.298 --> 01:56:14.980]  ArmstrongEconomics.com.
[01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:15.721]  One word.
[01:56:16.301 --> 01:56:18.965]  ArmstrongEconomics.com or ask-socrates.com.
[01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:26.883]  And then we have Maria Z in the fourth hour in studio from Australia.
[01:56:27.423 --> 01:56:30.305]  We'll be right back with our special guest in 60 seconds.
[01:56:30.325 --> 01:56:30.765]  Stay with us.
[01:56:31.045 --> 01:56:32.986]  Well, my job really is easy.
[01:56:33.146 --> 01:56:35.727]  Corporate establishment media get talking points.
[01:56:36.148 --> 01:56:38.729]  It's on record to spew disinfo.
[01:56:38.789 --> 01:56:39.889]  They lie for a living.
[01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:41.450]  They're puppets.
[01:56:41.490 --> 01:56:41.931]  They're sheep.
[01:56:41.951 --> 01:56:42.711]  They're NPCs.
[01:56:43.551 --> 01:56:44.052]  I get to
[01:56:45.677 --> 01:56:56.484]  Four hours a day, just with the regular show, not to mention reports, have guests on who have track records of being accurate and track records of being persecuted by the system.
[01:56:57.205 --> 01:57:00.967]  So on this show, you get the people that have the highest accuracy rates.
[01:57:01.707 --> 01:57:02.668]  That's why I love my job.
[01:57:02.688 --> 01:57:05.290]  I don't have to keep track of lies.
[01:57:05.310 --> 01:57:07.391]  I keep track of the truth as it develops.
[01:57:07.431 --> 01:57:08.292]  Well, Martin Armstrong,
[01:57:09.747 --> 01:57:13.611]  ArmstrongEconomics.com and Ask-Socrates.com is amazing.
[01:57:14.091 --> 01:57:19.057]  I'm not going to go over all the incredible stock market systems he invented and all the things he's done for more than three decades.
[01:57:19.357 --> 01:57:23.921]  He's been coming on as a guest for at least 15 years, and we're going to get into the waterfront here.
[01:57:26.102 --> 01:57:29.144]  We've got economic competence model.
[01:57:29.825 --> 01:57:39.032]  Martin's economic competence model has been honing in on September 24 for the worldwide uptick in the panic cycle, debt crisis, upcoming election, everything in between.
[01:57:39.552 --> 01:57:53.263]  So I'm trying to give you the floor, at least here in the first half of this hour, to give us a big picture where the world is, how it all ties together, the election of Venezuela, the Trump assassination attempt, and then drilling in the main trigger points that we're facing.
[01:57:53.304 --> 01:57:54.104]  So thanks for your time.
[01:57:54.124 --> 01:57:54.885]  We really appreciate it.
[01:57:56.374 --> 01:57:58.115]  Oh, it's always great to see you, Alex.
[01:57:58.155 --> 01:57:58.636]  How you been?
[01:57:58.656 --> 01:58:00.117]  Good, brother.
[01:58:02.599 --> 01:58:11.365]  I think people have to really understand that we are in a phase where the confidence in government is absolutely collapsing.
[01:58:11.385 --> 01:58:16.689]  I do believe it began with COVID, and this is on a worldwide scale.
[01:58:17.549 --> 01:58:22.833]  So, for example, just look at the elections that have taken place.
[01:58:23.293 --> 01:58:24.494]  You have the EU.
[01:58:26.035 --> 01:58:27.736]  They moved to the right.
[01:58:27.796 --> 01:58:30.878]  You had Britain, France.
[01:58:31.198 --> 01:58:36.702]  I mean, our computer basically does not look at polls.
[01:58:36.782 --> 01:58:37.943]  That's kind of nonsense.
[01:58:38.023 --> 01:58:43.186]  If you did a poll on Trump and you only called people in Washington, you'd say he'd lose, you know?
[01:58:46.850 --> 01:59:02.474]  Nigel Farage even came to our conference in 2019 in Rome, and he said of course he's here because one, he called us the alternative to Davos, but two, he said that basically our computer was the only one that said that he would have won.
[01:59:03.394 --> 01:59:10.495]  And people basically vote according to their economic situation.
[01:59:11.276 --> 01:59:13.136]  And what's happening globally here,
[01:59:14.586 --> 01:59:17.768]  Is that no matter who's in power, they're throwing them out.
[01:59:18.529 --> 01:59:22.271]  So it's not a left-right sort of thing.
[01:59:22.992 --> 01:59:26.694]  Our computer's been showing that, you know, Trump should win.
[01:59:26.714 --> 01:59:29.276]  I've been on record before.
[01:59:29.356 --> 01:59:33.199]  I said, you know, I understand Washington very well.
[01:59:33.319 --> 01:59:36.541]  I've been down there, you know, since Reagan's period.
[01:59:38.866 --> 01:59:44.588]  You know, I warned that they probably would even try to assassinate him because that's just their playbook.
[01:59:45.008 --> 01:59:46.909]  They did the same thing to JFK.
[01:59:47.069 --> 01:59:54.972]  Anybody that threatens their, the deep state's agenda, they try to take out one way or another.
[01:59:55.772 --> 01:59:58.333]  And most people don't realize, but you can Google it.
[01:59:59.278 --> 02:00:05.622]  You'll see, I believe that there is going to be a documentary coming out on Richard Nixon.
[02:00:06.262 --> 02:00:13.747]  But, I mean, there was a tape with the head of the CIA there, and Nixon said, I know who killed JFK.
[02:00:14.287 --> 02:00:16.148]  After that, they made sure they got rid of him.
[02:00:16.248 --> 02:00:22.532]  A couple of the guys that were in the Watergate thing were CIA people, and they just bumbled to get caught.
[02:00:23.773 --> 02:00:27.115]  But most importantly, when Nixon left office,
[02:00:27.876 --> 02:00:33.619]  He's entitled to, you know, Secret Service protection in perpetuity.
[02:00:34.479 --> 02:00:36.640]  He dismissed him and hired his own people.
[02:00:37.401 --> 02:00:40.142]  He did not trust the Secret Service to protect him.
[02:00:41.042 --> 02:00:43.023]  And I think that says it all.
[02:00:43.564 --> 02:00:51.687]  I mean, you can look throughout history, even in the Roman Empire, I mean, 13 emperors were assassinated by their own bodyguards.
[02:00:52.668 --> 02:00:54.789]  So, I mean, this is a common thing.
[02:00:55.532 --> 02:01:02.895]  But what we're looking at here is, it's really a major global debt crisis.
[02:01:04.056 --> 02:01:09.838]  And since World War Two, they've been borrowing year after year with no intention of paying anything back.
[02:01:10.759 --> 02:01:14.961]  And this is reaching the point of a climax here.
[02:01:15.841 --> 02:01:17.862]  And this is why they need war.
[02:01:18.963 --> 02:01:24.185]  And the Biden administration, the main reason they wanted Biden there,
[02:01:25.141 --> 02:01:31.467]  Uh, is because 40% of the time he was in Delaware, he was just basically a placeholder.
[02:01:32.108 --> 02:01:41.896]  So what was really taking place, then you have the Secretary of State Blinken threatening China over, oh, you go into Taiwan, we'll wage war.
[02:01:42.237 --> 02:01:45.259]  Well, China was the number one holder of U.S.
[02:01:45.299 --> 02:01:45.540]  debt.
[02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:50.164]  They dumped 53 billion just in the first three, you know, the first quarter of this year.
[02:01:50.894 --> 02:01:56.257]  Janet Yellen has to hop on a plane, run over there and say, oh, keep buying our debt, please.
[02:01:56.577 --> 02:01:57.458]  And they say, why?
[02:01:58.418 --> 02:02:01.540]  We want us to buy $100 billion so you can buy missiles to shoot us?
[02:02:04.482 --> 02:02:10.165]  Washington is in total chaos because there is not a president doing their job.
[02:02:10.885 --> 02:02:19.630]  And at these cabinet meetings, the president is supposed to be the referee because every agency, they're like two-year-old children.
[02:02:20.127 --> 02:02:21.420]  They all want their own way.
[02:02:22.265 --> 02:02:25.567]  So here you have EPA outlawing gas stoves, you know.
[02:02:27.388 --> 02:02:40.634]  And on the other hand, you have Lindsey Graham saying that there's $10 to $12 trillion worth of gas reserves under Crimea, and we can't allow Russia and China to get that.
[02:02:41.094 --> 02:02:46.817]  I mean, there is just no coherent strategy or common theme even.
[02:02:47.657 --> 02:02:51.179]  So what we see here, I just got back from your
[02:02:52.654 --> 02:02:59.135]  Spoke to a number of different governments there, and they're all preparing for war.
[02:03:00.215 --> 02:03:01.756]  Why do they want war?
[02:03:01.776 --> 02:03:12.958]  And I can tell you that basically their exit strategy for this debt crisis that we have, and the debt crisis comes.
[02:03:14.158 --> 02:03:17.178]  A lot of people say, oh, 34 trillion in debt.
[02:03:17.839 --> 02:03:20.059]  The level of debt really does not matter.
[02:03:21.252 --> 02:03:24.674]  What is the critical issue is when people stop buying it.
[02:03:25.514 --> 02:03:31.217]  As long as there's the next guy in line that continues to buy it, then they can keep rolling it and rolling it.
[02:03:31.897 --> 02:03:39.981]  But now when you're threatening China and things of this nature and the BRICS, people don't really understand what the BRICS is about.
[02:03:41.681 --> 02:03:43.202]  It's a geopolitical issue.
[02:03:43.994 --> 02:03:52.078]  Once they put sanctions on Russia, you have all these other countries beginning to realize, hey, wait a minute, if we don't do what the U.S.
[02:03:52.118 --> 02:03:54.759]  tells us to do, they can remove us from SWIFT.
[02:03:55.319 --> 02:03:57.040]  So that's what the BRICS is really about.
[02:03:59.341 --> 02:04:04.684]  They intend to actually, you know, they want to wage war.
[02:04:04.704 --> 02:04:06.605]  And what happens with war?
[02:04:07.445 --> 02:04:11.907]  You can go on eBay and you can buy all the bonds you want from all these different countries.
[02:04:13.955 --> 02:04:18.579]  They basically, a new government forms and they default on the last one.
[02:04:18.599 --> 02:04:22.662]  You can go on eBay and buy U.S.
[02:04:22.722 --> 02:04:26.404]  continental currency from all the states as well.
[02:04:26.424 --> 02:04:28.066]  You can buy confederate currency!
[02:04:28.626 --> 02:04:32.189]  So exactly, they always bring it to war when an old economic system is coming to an end.
[02:04:33.650 --> 02:04:33.870]  Yes.
[02:04:33.890 --> 02:04:35.971]  Because they get to default.
[02:04:36.852 --> 02:04:41.896]  And a new government comes in and it does not have to honor the debts of the last.
[02:04:43.055 --> 02:04:43.615]  That's what I said.
[02:04:43.695 --> 02:04:47.856]  You can go on eBay and you can buy continental currency.
[02:04:48.376 --> 02:04:53.577]  The Constitution, read it, that they were going to honor all the deaths of the previous.
[02:04:53.877 --> 02:04:54.477]  They never did.
[02:04:55.817 --> 02:04:58.378]  Spain, I mean, has defaulted seven times.
[02:04:59.318 --> 02:05:01.378]  France, it's on its fifth Republic.
[02:05:02.059 --> 02:05:04.539]  I mean, just go down the list.
[02:05:05.299 --> 02:05:08.960]  I mean, China, you can buy all these bonds from World War II.
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:09.860]  They all defaulted.
[02:05:10.686 --> 02:05:14.548]  All right, so if they create a war, they get two objectives out of this.
[02:05:14.768 --> 02:05:15.808]  One, they get to default.
[02:05:16.749 --> 02:05:21.231]  But two, that's what this whole digital currency issue is about.
[02:05:22.671 --> 02:05:31.935]  I've met with governments for a long time, as you know, and they all think that on average, Europe and the United States, that 35%
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:37.063]  of the economy is underground and not paying taxes.
[02:05:38.024 --> 02:05:42.108]  So how to get that tax is to eliminate physical money.
[02:05:42.909 --> 02:05:44.451]  That's what this is all about.
[02:05:44.731 --> 02:05:46.873]  They move to the digital currency side.
[02:05:47.574 --> 02:05:52.900]  And then, you know, you hire that 16 year old girl next door to watch the kids while you and your wife go out.
[02:05:53.630 --> 02:05:57.213]  Oh my god, you gave her $50, you know, and she didn't pay taxes?
[02:05:57.594 --> 02:05:58.455]  That's our problem.
[02:05:58.615 --> 02:05:59.776]  You know, that's the way they look at it.
[02:05:59.796 --> 02:06:03.079]  And so their answer is the cashless society monitoring every facet of our lives.
[02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:10.546]  I'm no economist like you or expert, but that's going to create incredible destruction of the economy, incredible pressure, and civil unrest.
[02:06:10.626 --> 02:06:11.407]  An angrier world.
[02:06:12.805 --> 02:06:20.470]  Yeah, just look at basically Nigeria where they pulled that off and all kinds of riots and burning banks and things.
[02:06:21.972 --> 02:06:33.400]  But also behind that, which just doesn't appear to be out in the press very much, is that the IMF has already created their digital coin.
[02:06:34.660 --> 02:06:39.144]  And the whole scheme here is that it's the IMF
[02:06:40.186 --> 02:06:41.687]  And it's not a conspiracy theory.
[02:06:41.708 --> 02:06:42.608]  You can look on my site.
[02:06:42.628 --> 02:06:45.291]  I've got a video there.
[02:06:45.371 --> 02:06:46.612]  Just Google Holland.
[02:07:04.412 --> 02:07:07.253]  And he was the former president of France.
[02:07:07.814 --> 02:07:19.839]  And I have a video I put on there with him standing up there with Merkel in the European Parliament saying the very purpose of the EU was one government for Europe to eliminate European war.
[02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:23.201]  This theory has been around for a long time.
[02:07:23.541 --> 02:07:25.042]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[02:07:25.062 --> 02:07:26.783]  That's why they claim they formed the EU.
[02:07:26.823 --> 02:07:27.683]  That's what they said they did.
[02:07:28.784 --> 02:07:30.284]  Yes, that's exactly why.
[02:07:32.521 --> 02:07:42.567]  And at this stage, they think that the plan is that the United Nations will step up and appear to be the peacemaker.
[02:07:43.468 --> 02:07:49.432]  And therefore, that will elevate them to this one world level of government.
[02:07:49.472 --> 02:07:55.456]  Just like Herbert Walker Bush said in 1990 and 91, he said, out of this UN war, we'll bring in a world government.
[02:07:57.097 --> 02:08:00.699]  This is, this has been a theory around for a long time.
[02:08:01.576 --> 02:08:04.878]  You know, that if there's one government, then you end war.
[02:08:05.558 --> 02:08:06.458]  I've argued with them.
[02:08:06.518 --> 02:08:08.459]  I say, you obviously don't know your history.
[02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:11.180]  The Roman Empire was one government.
[02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:12.541]  How many civil wars did they have?
[02:08:12.581 --> 02:08:17.183]  Well, even Elon Musk said at the World Government Summit last year, he said one world government will create nothing but civil war.
[02:08:18.224 --> 02:08:18.704]  Exactly.
[02:08:19.744 --> 02:08:20.685]  I see it in Europe.
[02:08:21.665 --> 02:08:23.986]  When they were forming the euro, they came to me.
[02:08:24.466 --> 02:08:28.008]  I sat down with them and I warned them this is not going to work.
[02:08:29.915 --> 02:08:38.762]  They were selling it to everybody that, like the United States, will have a single currency, everybody will pay the same interest rate.
[02:08:39.463 --> 02:08:42.305]  And I can tell you what happened.
[02:08:43.266 --> 02:08:48.410]  Chancellor Kohl of Germany did not allow the German people to vote for the euro.
[02:08:49.150 --> 02:08:56.937]  He unilaterally took Germany in, because he said if the German people voted, he would have lost 7 to 1.
[02:08:57.097 --> 02:08:58.158]  I remember that deadline.
[02:08:59.753 --> 02:09:00.053]  Yeah.
[02:09:00.113 --> 02:09:04.595]  So what he did was he took Germany into the EU and that created the euro.
[02:09:05.595 --> 02:09:10.597]  And basically to do that, he said you cannot consolidate the debt.
[02:09:11.598 --> 02:09:13.719]  So every country still has its own debt.
[02:09:14.039 --> 02:09:15.639]  There isn't a single national debt.
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:25.883]  And I warned them that all you're going to do is transfer the volatility in trading foreign exchange from the foreign exchange market to the bond market.
[02:09:26.244 --> 02:09:27.124]  And that's what's happened.
[02:09:28.112 --> 02:09:32.693]  Alright, they don't understand trading, they don't understand markets, they don't understand anything.
[02:09:32.813 --> 02:09:34.554]  And they think they can always raise more taxes.
[02:09:34.574 --> 02:09:36.335]  Let me ask you this, to go back to your main point.
[02:09:37.315 --> 02:09:43.017]  The globalists, the big banks, they're all shutting down fertilizer, food production, paying farmers not to grow crops.
[02:09:43.797 --> 02:09:53.820]  If they're actually trying to prop up a bubble or bring in a new bubble, why would you attack energy and food production when that's the basis of everything?
[02:09:55.097 --> 02:09:56.598]  Well, because they want to consolidate control.
[02:09:56.618 --> 02:09:59.439]  But don't they get by consolidating control, they create even more volatility.
[02:09:59.719 --> 02:10:01.780]  And they thought they could blame climate change.
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:04.001]  But most people aren't blaming climate change.
[02:10:04.041 --> 02:10:05.322]  They know it's globalist policy.
[02:10:05.362 --> 02:10:07.523]  So why are they at war with the real economy?
[02:10:07.543 --> 02:10:08.223]  What's the plan there?
[02:10:10.104 --> 02:10:11.685]  It's this is how they get power.
[02:10:12.445 --> 02:10:17.087]  They basically do want it to decline and say, oh, come to me, I'll save it.
[02:10:17.807 --> 02:10:19.288]  You know, you don't
[02:10:19.938 --> 02:10:23.520]  Basically, uh, change something unless it's broken.
[02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:24.301]  Exactly.
[02:10:24.341 --> 02:10:25.121]  They're the savers.
[02:10:25.161 --> 02:10:30.705]  They said, we're going to save you from climate change that causes mass starvation while they open the borders and cut the food off.
[02:10:30.925 --> 02:10:32.806]  But people aren't buying that BS.
[02:10:32.866 --> 02:10:38.009]  Don't they get that they're now the villains that Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab of the UN are the most hated groups out there?
[02:10:40.951 --> 02:10:46.054]  Basically, I, you know, they, I can tell you Klaus Schwab resigned from
[02:10:47.330 --> 02:10:49.111]  CEO just moved to chairman.
[02:10:49.431 --> 02:10:50.191]  He's still there.
[02:10:50.871 --> 02:10:56.933]  But he did so because of all the negative publicity against him.
[02:10:56.953 --> 02:11:03.256]  I mean, these people think that we are stupid.
[02:11:03.276 --> 02:11:03.756]  Yep.
[02:11:04.116 --> 02:11:08.878]  And I've just heard this for, you know, I've been dealing with governments, honestly, for 50 years.
[02:11:09.898 --> 02:11:12.339]  And I can tell you, I was down there
[02:11:13.308 --> 02:11:17.432]  When Reagan was in and they were all upset when Reagan was elected.
[02:11:18.373 --> 02:11:20.295]  And I said, you know, what's the problem?
[02:11:20.495 --> 02:11:21.536]  Oh, you don't understand.
[02:11:21.596 --> 02:11:22.797]  I said, well, explain it to me.
[02:11:23.698 --> 02:11:25.419]  And they said, look, he's a governor.
[02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:27.261]  We're going to have to train him.
[02:11:27.281 --> 02:11:28.542]  All right.
[02:11:28.702 --> 02:11:32.526]  They don't like anybody from outside of Washington.
[02:11:32.666 --> 02:11:34.027]  That's why they don't like Trump.
[02:11:34.127 --> 02:11:35.208]  That's why they hate Trump.
[02:11:36.530 --> 02:11:38.792]  And they also don't don't like RFK.
[02:11:41.138 --> 02:11:44.341]  It's you're coming in and playing in our sandbox.
[02:11:47.423 --> 02:11:49.425]  And that's basically the real problem.
[02:11:49.825 --> 02:11:59.812]  What they told Reagan when he wanted to meet with Gorbachev, I can tell you absolutely because I was down there.
[02:12:00.473 --> 02:12:07.338]  The neocons told him, OK, fine, he's no longer a communist, but you can never trust a Russian.
[02:12:08.579 --> 02:12:08.679]  And
[02:12:09.502 --> 02:12:12.606]  You know, Trump was right.
[02:12:12.726 --> 02:12:15.990]  NATO is an absolute terrorist organization.
[02:12:16.390 --> 02:12:17.671]  They should have been shut down.
[02:12:18.292 --> 02:12:22.958]  The whole purpose of it was basically to defend Europe against communism.
[02:12:23.378 --> 02:12:23.859]  That was it.
[02:12:24.139 --> 02:12:26.362]  That was when Gorbachev said, we will bury you.
[02:12:26.842 --> 02:12:27.122]  All right.
[02:12:27.483 --> 02:12:28.444]  Those days are gone.
[02:12:29.304 --> 02:12:29.604]  All right.
[02:12:30.105 --> 02:12:35.390]  As you know, I was in the middle of the whole Russian thing back in 1999.
[02:12:35.891 --> 02:12:41.817]  I mean, they were basically interfering in the Russian election for 2000.
[02:12:41.877 --> 02:12:52.728]  They blackmailed Yeltsin to try and get him to step down, and they wanted to stick in their puppet to run Russia, who was Baryshnovsky.
[02:12:54.231 --> 02:12:59.554]  They wanted me to put in $10 billion into this hermitage capital, and I refused.
[02:13:00.775 --> 02:13:11.823]  And they rigged that election when Yeltsin realized he was getting blackmailed, and he was getting attacked on the opposite side.
[02:13:11.843 --> 02:13:17.727]  The old neocon Russians, the communists, they had filed a motion for impeachment.
[02:13:18.436 --> 02:13:23.318]  So he was getting it from the U.S., trying to interfere, and the other side.
[02:13:23.358 --> 02:13:24.579]  That's why he turned to Putin.
[02:13:25.219 --> 02:13:28.020]  Because Putin was not an oligarch, and he wasn't a communist.
[02:13:29.301 --> 02:13:34.003]  And that's why they hate Putin so much, because he basically did that.
[02:13:34.423 --> 02:13:37.324]  He doesn't play along with the stereotype they want.
[02:13:38.865 --> 02:13:39.825]  No, he doesn't.
[02:13:39.965 --> 02:13:46.308]  And look, I've got the declassified documents from the Clinton administration.
[02:13:47.356 --> 02:13:51.060]  And what Putin said in that interview with Tucker was correct.
[02:13:51.681 --> 02:13:52.081]  All right.
[02:13:52.522 --> 02:14:00.310]  I have the document showing that the Clinton administration, there was a proposal for Russia to join NATO.
[02:14:01.110 --> 02:14:10.200]  That is why the communists there staged the coup against Gorbachev, because they felt that would be a surrender to the United States.
[02:14:11.198 --> 02:14:11.558]  All right.
[02:14:11.719 --> 02:14:13.500]  And that's what that coup was all about.
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:17.023]  And then you had Yeltsin standing on the tank, et cetera, and all that.
[02:14:17.804 --> 02:14:20.106]  People have to understand, you know,
[02:14:21.284 --> 02:14:27.146]  Why, you know, did Hillary suddenly say that Putin interfered in the 2016 election?
[02:14:27.666 --> 02:14:30.648]  And she said, oh, because I had said one of his elections were rigged.
[02:14:31.028 --> 02:14:31.948]  No, that wasn't it.
[02:14:32.208 --> 02:14:40.971]  It was basically because the U.S., under the Clinton administration and the bankers, were trying to interfere in the Russian 2000 election.
[02:14:40.991 --> 02:14:42.332]  They were trying to take it over then.
[02:14:42.352 --> 02:14:46.033]  Sure, so it looks to me like Ukraine's failed.
[02:14:46.153 --> 02:14:47.634]  Everything the globalists have done have failed.
[02:14:48.034 --> 02:14:50.575]  Moving us up, you know, a great economist here with us.
[02:14:52.766 --> 02:14:54.006]  What's the 35,000 foot view?
[02:14:54.166 --> 02:14:54.566]  You said it.
[02:14:54.606 --> 02:14:55.907]  Things are going horrible for the globalists.
[02:14:55.927 --> 02:14:56.547]  They admit it is.
[02:14:57.227 --> 02:14:58.447]  Washington's totally incompetent.
[02:14:58.467 --> 02:14:59.207]  They're in disarray.
[02:14:59.547 --> 02:15:03.508]  Martin Armstrong, the attempted assassination of Trump, your quick snapshot on that.
[02:15:03.548 --> 02:15:07.129]  We'll go to break and come back with the election, the economy, everything else.
[02:15:09.690 --> 02:15:13.550]  Look, that was clearly a setup.
[02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:14.851]  It's out of their playbook.
[02:15:15.431 --> 02:15:17.891]  When there's some sort of, it's always a loner.
[02:15:18.211 --> 02:15:19.752]  You basically take him out.
[02:15:20.232 --> 02:15:21.432]  And when they present him,
[02:15:22.381 --> 02:15:22.881]  Look at it.
[02:15:22.901 --> 02:15:23.941]  It's very curious.
[02:15:24.582 --> 02:15:28.683]  Anyone that they use like that, they always use three names.
[02:15:29.443 --> 02:15:30.463]  That's in their playbook.
[02:15:31.344 --> 02:15:33.864]  Like me, Harvey Oswald.
[02:15:35.245 --> 02:15:40.846]  They were trying to take out Trump because he represents the greatest threat to them.
[02:15:41.567 --> 02:15:46.228]  Trump knows the last time he was there, they stuffed his cabinet.
[02:15:46.863 --> 02:15:50.308]  They said, oh, you don't really have you need to give confidence.
[02:15:50.728 --> 02:15:53.352]  So they stuck in people like John Bolton, et cetera.
[02:15:54.513 --> 02:15:57.317]  And he all of them.
[02:15:58.459 --> 02:15:58.799]  Yeah.
[02:15:58.859 --> 02:16:01.583]  So this time now he knows the game.
[02:16:02.378 --> 02:16:02.698]  All right.
[02:16:02.838 --> 02:16:05.319]  He gets back in, he puts in his own cabinet.
[02:16:05.659 --> 02:16:10.220]  That is the biggest threat to the neocons probably in the history of this country.
[02:16:10.260 --> 02:16:10.620]  That's right.
[02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:12.600]  He only got General Flynn in.
[02:16:12.700 --> 02:16:14.621]  He only got General Flynn and that was one good guy.
[02:16:14.901 --> 02:16:16.121]  That's why they went so ape after him.
[02:16:16.161 --> 02:16:16.501]  Go ahead.
[02:16:16.521 --> 02:16:16.761]  Sorry.
[02:16:18.141 --> 02:16:18.461]  Yeah.
[02:16:18.542 --> 02:16:21.882]  I mean, look, I know a number of these people.
[02:16:21.902 --> 02:16:25.163]  I mean, and it's,
[02:16:26.333 --> 02:16:32.059]  I know Bill Kristol, who wrote even the book to justify going into Iraq.
[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:34.161]  And I used to argue with him.
[02:16:34.262 --> 02:16:44.572]  I said, you know, he thought you go into the Middle East, you remove all these dictators, Saddam Hussein, Assad out of Assyria, Gaddafi, and then we'll bring peace.
[02:16:44.952 --> 02:16:47.315]  I said, you cannot do that.
[02:16:48.050 --> 02:16:48.931]  I said, you do that.
[02:16:48.971 --> 02:16:51.933]  You're basically this idea of regime change.
[02:16:52.353 --> 02:16:53.174]  You're disturbing.
[02:16:53.194 --> 02:16:55.636]  You know, people have their own culture.
[02:16:56.076 --> 02:16:58.598]  You cannot basically force them to adopt your culture.
[02:16:58.618 --> 02:17:01.140]  Well, it creates a power vacuum and civil war.
[02:17:01.160 --> 02:17:11.348]  Look, this is, you know, our computer has been remarkable on forecasting politics.
[02:17:12.268 --> 02:17:14.550]  This time, I can tell you it's showing.
[02:17:14.890 --> 02:17:15.611]  I was shocked.
[02:17:16.748 --> 02:17:22.714]  It's showing that two of the six models, one is 61% for Trump, one is 59.
[02:17:23.374 --> 02:17:27.459]  There are only three presidents in history that ever reached 60%.
[02:17:28.139 --> 02:17:38.350]  That was FDR one time, that was after JFK's assassination, Johnson, and Nixon when he said he was taking us out of Vietnam.
[02:17:39.162 --> 02:17:47.831]  Everybody else, you look at it, Obama, whatever, you see 51, 52%, and they pretend this 1 or 2% is a mandate, and it's not.
[02:17:49.072 --> 02:17:55.178]  But, you know, I think the polarization of the country started with Hillary,
[02:17:56.288 --> 02:18:00.110]  And saying anybody that voted for Trump was a deplorable.
[02:18:02.410 --> 02:18:09.133]  Even Jamie Dimon got on the stage at Davos and said Trump was right about the border.
[02:18:09.513 --> 02:18:11.614]  He was right about NATO.
[02:18:12.274 --> 02:18:19.997]  And he cautioned the Democrats that you're basically hating half the country.
[02:18:20.017 --> 02:18:23.958]  I mean, the United States will break up.
[02:18:23.999 --> 02:18:25.259]  There's no question about it.
[02:18:26.088 --> 02:18:36.591]  We cannot stand as a unified country like this and any sort of civil regulations, etc.
[02:18:36.951 --> 02:18:38.071]  People have to understand.
[02:18:39.632 --> 02:18:43.032]  These governments always seek central control.
[02:18:44.553 --> 02:18:44.873]  Hold on.
[02:18:45.033 --> 02:18:46.833]  Martin Armstrong, you'll have the floor.
[02:18:46.873 --> 02:18:47.254]  Incredible.
[02:18:47.594 --> 02:18:51.575]  I should have up front talked about your world-famous computer models and the election and war.
[02:18:51.675 --> 02:18:52.435]  So let's start over.
[02:18:53.544 --> 02:18:56.006]  Because the most important part came right there at the end.
[02:18:56.166 --> 02:19:04.354]  We'll come back, you can make your point you were just making, and then get into your models, and then what you believe is the probability of the breakup of the United States.
[02:19:04.975 --> 02:19:06.216]  How does this crash landing happen?
[02:19:06.276 --> 02:19:06.936]  Is it survivable?
[02:19:06.956 --> 02:19:07.337]  Stay with us.
[02:19:08.666 --> 02:19:14.729]  Whether it's the World Economic Forum, whether it's the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, whether it's Open Philanthropy and Dustin Moskowitz.
[02:19:14.769 --> 02:19:20.392]  We know that all of these organizations thought that they could bamboozle all of us.
[02:19:20.792 --> 02:19:25.555]  They thought that by putting fact checkers on every post, we'd stop sharing posts.
[02:19:26.015 --> 02:19:29.917]  They thought by canceling people, that we wouldn't actually listen to people's voices.
[02:19:30.037 --> 02:19:31.598]  But the bad news is for them,
[02:19:32.378 --> 02:19:33.498]  We continue to do it.
[02:19:33.859 --> 02:19:35.699]  So what are the simple things that you can do?
[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:42.082]  The simple things you can do, like I said before, support the alternative platforms that are allowing these voices to be heard.
[02:19:42.402 --> 02:19:44.863]  Make sure that you actually have these conversations.
[02:19:45.023 --> 02:19:49.885]  Without the utility of this voice and this platform, we will lose the war.
[02:19:50.305 --> 02:19:51.666]  So our job is really simple.
[02:19:52.106 --> 02:19:54.407]  So the Deep State is in total panic mode.
[02:19:54.467 --> 02:19:59.049]  Elon Musk just posted about what broke on Gab last week.
[02:19:59.249 --> 02:20:07.833]  The FBI sent a subpoena to Torba, the head of Gab, and this is a side issue, and it was all leftist stuff.
[02:20:21.095 --> 02:20:21.435]  I think so.
[02:20:44.779 --> 02:20:51.001]  You take the head economist or the head of France's financial system under Macron.
[02:20:51.401 --> 02:20:53.662]  He said like six months ago, don't worry about our economy.
[02:20:53.922 --> 02:20:55.542]  We're going to have a 20-year war with Russia.
[02:20:55.942 --> 02:20:58.703]  We've seen other statements in the EU about we're a war economy now.
[02:21:00.003 --> 02:21:05.265]  So they're planning this long protracted war that's already escalated with hypersonic missiles on the Russian border.
[02:21:06.775 --> 02:21:07.595]  It's totally insane.
[02:21:07.616 --> 02:21:14.319]  So in the last 30 minutes, he dropped some huge bombshells, but he got interrupted on a point he was making about the break, the hard break.
[02:21:14.339 --> 02:21:23.625]  And then I want to go back into his computer models that are world renowned and just the whole waterfront here, the election, potential breakup of the U.S., how we mitigate this.
[02:21:23.925 --> 02:21:26.806]  So, Mr. Armstrong, please continue with ArmstrongEconomics.com.
[02:21:26.926 --> 02:21:29.588]  All right.
[02:21:29.708 --> 02:21:34.831]  I think, you know, people have to understand that if you look at Russia,
[02:21:35.814 --> 02:21:54.000]  When Lenin wanted to, basically, he wanted to create a confederation based upon the United States, where each state still retained its individuality and its effective sovereignty.
[02:21:55.641 --> 02:22:00.902]  And he had even written a letter, do not let Stalin, you know, succeed me.
[02:22:03.741 --> 02:22:10.503]  You know, it's widely rumored in Russia that Stalin poisoned both Lenin and his wife.
[02:22:11.044 --> 02:22:13.484]  It was Stalin who usurped all the power.
[02:22:14.105 --> 02:22:14.585]  Central.
[02:22:15.325 --> 02:22:20.627]  When you do that, alright, you're creating this one-size-fits-all.
[02:22:21.167 --> 02:22:26.669]  And throughout history, no government has ever survived under that model.
[02:22:27.889 --> 02:22:32.231]  The Roman Empire is what we should be actually adopting.
[02:22:32.251 --> 02:22:38.193]  A lot of people said, oh, they were pagans, they had all these gods.
[02:22:38.273 --> 02:22:40.534]  It's because they allowed freedom of religion.
[02:22:40.554 --> 02:22:45.155]  And if they conquered a land, they didn't say you have to respect our gods.
[02:22:45.355 --> 02:22:46.956]  They let the culture remain.
[02:22:47.634 --> 02:22:53.897]  All right, so they didn't get involved in socialized dictates, etc.
[02:22:53.977 --> 02:23:00.000]  So our problem here is that now when one side gets in, it's our turn to oppress the other.
[02:23:00.020 --> 02:23:04.662]  And this is just not the way civilization functions.
[02:23:05.303 --> 02:23:11.346]  You know, it's supposed to be that we all come together basically because we all benefit.
[02:23:11.906 --> 02:23:16.108]  When you get one group in, and ever since this socialistic idea
[02:23:18.575 --> 02:23:35.844]  Let me interrupt you because you mentioned that in studies the main reason we lost in Afghanistan over after 20 years was the transgenderism and the leftist so it was with Reagan and Levi's and Coca-Cola
[02:23:36.644 --> 02:23:39.225]  A lot of this has been just the sales propaganda for the UN.
[02:24:04.152 --> 02:24:06.506]  That effectively, you need...
[02:24:08.215 --> 02:24:10.136]  The problem of climate change.
[02:24:10.737 --> 02:24:15.940]  Only one, it's going to take one power to regulate the entire world.
[02:24:16.941 --> 02:24:20.323]  Individual countries can't solve, you know, climate change.
[02:24:20.723 --> 02:24:28.608]  So this nonsense about this is all behind why the United Nations should be at the top and dictate to everybody.
[02:24:28.648 --> 02:24:32.430]  Exactly, and so they tried climate change and that didn't work, so then it was COVID, that didn't work.
[02:24:33.031 --> 02:24:34.612]  Now it's World War III, that's not going to work.
[02:24:36.585 --> 02:24:45.889]  Uh, World War Three is we're not going to survive this the way we they think the West is finished in that sense.
[02:24:46.249 --> 02:24:50.671]  And look, the financial capital world always migrates.
[02:24:51.131 --> 02:24:56.714]  It was with, you know, Babylon that they lost it to to to Greece.
[02:24:56.814 --> 02:24:58.194]  Greece lost it to Rome.
[02:24:59.215 --> 02:25:01.156]  You can just go down the line.
[02:25:01.216 --> 02:25:03.777]  And France, Spain had it.
[02:25:03.817 --> 02:25:04.497]  They lost it to
[02:25:04.897 --> 02:25:10.764]  Yeah, and we will now lose it to China.
[02:25:11.204 --> 02:25:11.905]  Simple as that.
[02:25:13.587 --> 02:25:17.912]  China understands something that Russia does not.
[02:25:18.812 --> 02:25:28.695]  All right, China understands what made America the main economy, because we had a consumer-based economy that everybody else wanted to sell to.
[02:25:29.275 --> 02:25:30.156]  Look at Germany.
[02:25:31.076 --> 02:25:34.737]  The average German has less net worth than an Italian.
[02:25:34.957 --> 02:25:35.277]  Why?
[02:25:35.377 --> 02:25:37.038]  They keep their taxes very high.
[02:25:38.044 --> 02:25:40.226]  Uh, they misinterpreted hyperinflation.
[02:25:40.246 --> 02:25:46.092]  They thought hyperinflation was just printing money where that was the response to what the government did before.
[02:25:46.112 --> 02:25:53.259]  But, um, and in December 22, they confiscated just 10% of everybody's assets in the bank.
[02:25:53.779 --> 02:25:57.222]  And you started taking your money out of the bank and you fled the country.
[02:25:57.262 --> 02:25:59.945]  Basically, that's what the hyperinflation came the next year.
[02:26:01.354 --> 02:26:09.459]  But you know this is you know what we have to look at here is that those that are in power never get it right.
[02:26:09.479 --> 02:26:10.920]  All right.
[02:26:11.540 --> 02:26:21.066]  Germany their biggest problem is that they continue to use the old 18th century mercantile model.
[02:26:21.467 --> 02:26:23.608]  We build things and sell them to everybody else.
[02:26:24.669 --> 02:26:30.934]  So they keep their taxes high and the average German, as I said, has less net worth than an Italian.
[02:26:31.554 --> 02:26:35.337]  America basically was a consumer freedom economy.
[02:26:35.977 --> 02:26:37.779]  And that's why everybody came here.
[02:26:37.799 --> 02:26:44.904]  You know, China, Japan, Germany, they all basically rose from the ashes by selling things to Americans.
[02:26:45.685 --> 02:26:48.006]  China understands this difference.
[02:26:48.066 --> 02:26:50.168]  They're not following the German model.
[02:26:50.188 --> 02:26:51.409]  They're following the U.S.
[02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:51.749]  model.
[02:26:52.825 --> 02:26:55.886]  And this is why they're rebuilding the Silk Road, etc.
[02:26:56.306 --> 02:27:00.968]  They will surpass the United States as the financial capital of the world.
[02:27:02.869 --> 02:27:06.390]  And we are too busy, you know, fighting over socialism.
[02:27:06.971 --> 02:27:10.372]  Just like communism failed, we are going to fail.
[02:27:11.252 --> 02:27:14.074]  This socialistic idea does not work.
[02:27:14.114 --> 02:27:15.234]  What is the timeline?
[02:27:15.894 --> 02:27:17.515]  America is clearly in massive decline.
[02:27:17.575 --> 02:27:19.996]  And can Trump, if he gets in, circumvent that?
[02:27:22.984 --> 02:27:23.765]  I wish he could.
[02:27:23.785 --> 02:27:28.588]  I mean, our computer, you have to understand that it's not my personal opinion.
[02:27:29.209 --> 02:27:29.469]  All right?
[02:27:29.509 --> 02:27:35.934]  The computer shows we are headed into a recession to 2028, and I don't really care who is the president.
[02:27:36.635 --> 02:27:36.955]  All right?
[02:27:37.375 --> 02:27:48.244]  On the election side, I can tell you it is saying that Trump should win and that there is going to be a substantial rise in civil unrest.
[02:27:48.786 --> 02:27:53.412]  Because, you know, neither side is going to accept a loss.
[02:27:54.273 --> 02:27:55.575]  I mean, just look at Venezuela.
[02:27:55.755 --> 02:27:56.436]  The same thing.
[02:27:56.576 --> 02:28:01.582]  Everywhere you go, people are now conditioned not to believe elections.
[02:28:08.649 --> 02:28:10.590]  Your computer says the real numbers show Trump's going to win.
[02:28:10.610 --> 02:28:11.670]  That's clear from all the numbers.
[02:28:11.690 --> 02:28:13.390]  I agree with your computer and your research.
[02:28:13.831 --> 02:28:15.971]  But how does the wild card of election fraud play in?
[02:28:15.991 --> 02:28:18.992]  I guess that just supercharges even more political awakening.
[02:28:20.293 --> 02:28:26.895]  Yeah, it basically is... I mean, just look at the press.
[02:28:26.955 --> 02:28:31.416]  I mean, they stir the pot all the time.
[02:28:32.364 --> 02:28:34.827]  You know, they're not interested in reporting the news.
[02:28:34.847 --> 02:28:39.051]  They're trying to infiltrate people to, oh, you better vote against Trump.
[02:28:39.292 --> 02:28:40.233]  Do this, do that.
[02:28:40.333 --> 02:28:43.396]  He's going to destroy the country, this or whatever.
[02:28:43.416 --> 02:28:48.562]  Where the elites care, we'd want a strong leader to sell America and prop us up and they would own and get richer.
[02:28:48.602 --> 02:28:52.866]  But instead, because they want the petty power, because they won't be in charge, the people will.
[02:28:53.086 --> 02:28:54.168]  They get in the way of success.
[02:28:55.899 --> 02:29:07.910]  Look, I can tell you, I was down in Capitol Hill after the 2007-2009 crisis, and I can tell you what they told me at that point.
[02:29:08.510 --> 02:29:12.974]  Even everybody else that was conservative, oh, well, don't cut the spending for me.
[02:29:15.056 --> 02:29:16.938]  There's too much self-interest in this.
[02:29:18.038 --> 02:29:20.861]  They can pretend- So they're going to ride it until the wheels come off?
[02:29:20.881 --> 02:29:22.062]  They're going to ride it until the wheels come off?
[02:29:22.082 --> 02:29:22.903]  So when do the wheels come off?
[02:29:25.099 --> 02:29:30.383]  It's looking as though we're looking at the collapse of Republican forms of government.
[02:29:31.244 --> 02:29:35.847]  And that most likely is going, our computer showing that is around 2032.
[02:29:36.848 --> 02:29:47.456]  Between here and now, you're going to see it constantly get more and more confusing as you're spreading it to the masses.
[02:29:48.391 --> 02:29:51.713]  I mean, there were a number of us to realize, hey, there's a problem here.
[02:29:51.733 --> 02:29:52.573]  All right.
[02:29:52.613 --> 02:29:59.016]  But that is now spreading as more and more people begin to realize you cannot trust politicians, et cetera.
[02:29:59.917 --> 02:30:04.559]  And this is what all these elections just this year so far been about.
[02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:08.141]  Sixty percent of the world was going to elections.
[02:30:08.161 --> 02:30:12.043]  They're basically throwing out whoever whoever's in power, just throw them out.
[02:30:13.984 --> 02:30:14.084]  And
[02:30:15.916 --> 02:30:19.137]  It's, you know, it's really just horrible.
[02:30:19.317 --> 02:30:26.619]  And the governments think the answer is surveillance and censorship and control, which only, again, makes it more oxygen to the fire.
[02:30:29.200 --> 02:30:30.821]  Look, they know they're losing power.
[02:30:32.021 --> 02:30:35.122]  As they know they're losing power, they get more authoritarian.
[02:30:35.882 --> 02:30:39.023]  This is consistent throughout history.
[02:30:39.043 --> 02:30:39.223]  Yes.
[02:30:39.463 --> 02:30:39.823]  All right?
[02:30:39.883 --> 02:30:43.144]  It does not... Now you're talking about humans act the same.
[02:30:43.204 --> 02:30:44.265]  We're going through a pattern.
[02:30:44.385 --> 02:30:45.105]  I mean, it's happening.
[02:30:45.956 --> 02:30:50.982]  Yes, history repeats because it's always human nature that never changes.
[02:30:51.702 --> 02:30:56.748]  So, you know, in Roman times, okay fine, I wanted to kill you, I'd use a sword.
[02:30:57.428 --> 02:31:00.932]  Star Wars was just basically the Roman history updated.
[02:31:00.972 --> 02:31:02.654]  Instead of a sword, it's a lightsaber.
[02:31:02.794 --> 02:31:06.458]  I mean, what difference is it if I shoot you or if I use the sword?
[02:31:06.518 --> 02:31:06.719]  I mean,
[02:31:08.080 --> 02:31:11.222]  The human emotions have never changed, all right?
[02:31:11.262 --> 02:31:12.342]  Corruption is there.
[02:31:12.883 --> 02:31:19.567]  You can look, you can find that the first sovereign defaults was 400 BC, all right?
[02:31:20.768 --> 02:31:21.648]  Nothing's changed.
[02:31:22.128 --> 02:31:25.591]  How many governments have ever, ever paid off their debt?
[02:31:25.991 --> 02:31:28.372]  Only one that I know of, and that was Romania.
[02:31:29.173 --> 02:31:34.596]  You know, every single government for, you know, you're talking for basically for 4,000 years,
[02:31:36.303 --> 02:31:37.984]  Has always defaulted on their debt.
[02:31:38.425 --> 02:31:38.785]  Period.
[02:31:59.779 --> 02:32:10.262]  The old aristocrats knew you gotta have jobs and build things and have museums and libraries and schools because what is your wealth worth if there's nothing to spend it or nothing to own?
[02:32:10.723 --> 02:32:18.585]  But instead you have this kleptocratic consolidation of power that's actually destroying the real wealth, but they look at a ballot sheet of trillions and say, look how rich I am.
[02:32:22.640 --> 02:32:27.047]  A billion today, you know, is just, you know, monopoly money.
[02:32:27.107 --> 02:32:29.811]  A billion, you know, 20 years ago was real money.
[02:32:32.214 --> 02:32:35.239]  This is, they don't understand what they're doing.
[02:32:35.962 --> 02:32:38.343]  You know, they're only interested in control.
[02:32:38.443 --> 02:32:43.164]  And if it goes against what they think should happen, then they try to intervene.
[02:32:43.664 --> 02:32:45.225]  And that's what this is all about.
[02:32:45.445 --> 02:32:45.805]  And you're right.
[02:32:45.825 --> 02:32:47.986]  And they don't even look at second or third level to interrupt.
[02:32:48.586 --> 02:32:52.967]  They don't even look at second or third level because I'm smart enough to go, OK, this is happening.
[02:32:53.007 --> 02:32:54.068]  They don't like to intervene.
[02:32:54.408 --> 02:32:57.969]  And almost every time it makes it worse because they're looking at it one dimensionally.
[02:32:58.029 --> 02:33:00.230]  Why can't they think two, three, four dimensional?
[02:33:03.230 --> 02:33:03.811]  I don't know.
[02:33:05.686 --> 02:33:14.391]  You know, I think mainly because the academics have poisoned the well to a lot of, you know, around the world.
[02:33:15.071 --> 02:33:16.512]  You take Klaus Schwab.
[02:33:17.833 --> 02:33:26.377]  Look, this idea that began with Karl Marx, and it's more than just communism or capitalism.
[02:33:26.877 --> 02:33:31.860]  He believed that government had the power to intervene and control society.
[02:33:33.141 --> 02:33:35.162]  Keynes did the same thing.
[02:33:36.567 --> 02:33:45.475]  You can Google Paul Volcker in 79, you know, his rediscovery of the business cycle.
[02:33:46.095 --> 02:33:46.415]  All right.
[02:33:46.555 --> 02:33:50.338]  He basically talked about Keynesian economics and how it failed.
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:55.483]  As you know, I probably deal with more central banks than anybody in the world.
[02:33:56.183 --> 02:33:57.624]  And they are in trouble.
[02:33:57.664 --> 02:33:58.385]  They know that.
[02:33:59.125 --> 02:33:59.426]  All right.
[02:33:59.646 --> 02:33:59.986]  Why?
[02:34:00.046 --> 02:34:03.469]  Because when Keynesian economics began,
[02:34:04.384 --> 02:34:05.885]  In the 1930s, the U.S.
[02:34:05.925 --> 02:34:06.945]  had a balanced budget.
[02:34:07.606 --> 02:34:11.487]  So if it raised interest rates or lower interest rates, it affected us.
[02:34:12.688 --> 02:34:12.988]  All right.
[02:34:13.028 --> 02:34:13.788]  Not the government.
[02:34:14.068 --> 02:34:16.069]  Today, the government is the biggest borrower.
[02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:20.811]  This is what Powell came out in December and said.
[02:34:20.891 --> 02:34:22.812]  This spending is unsustainable.
[02:34:23.773 --> 02:34:25.794]  You have to understand central banks.
[02:34:26.414 --> 02:34:30.776]  The number one rule is you never criticize your current administration.
[02:34:31.508 --> 02:34:33.930]  He broke that rule in December of last year.
[02:34:34.050 --> 02:34:37.352]  It was the first time the Federal Reserve did that since 1951.
[02:34:38.513 --> 02:34:39.614]  Yep.
[02:34:39.794 --> 02:34:43.837]  They broke that same rule against the Korean War.
[02:34:43.937 --> 02:34:44.397]  And explain.
[02:34:44.417 --> 02:34:45.298]  That's because they're scared.
[02:34:45.358 --> 02:34:45.798]  They're scared.
[02:34:47.559 --> 02:34:48.260]  He knows.
[02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:51.302]  He can't stop the inflation.
[02:34:52.290 --> 02:34:55.292]  First of all, it's based on shortages, not speculation.
[02:34:55.652 --> 02:34:55.892]  All right?
[02:34:55.992 --> 02:34:58.814]  But he raises... And that goes to my earlier question.
[02:34:58.834 --> 02:35:04.797]  They try to suppress production for control, not knowing production would get them out of this.
[02:35:04.877 --> 02:35:05.397]  Innovation.
[02:35:05.597 --> 02:35:06.618]  But it's insane.
[02:35:06.698 --> 02:35:07.158]  Exactly.
[02:35:08.777 --> 02:35:10.198]  Look, that's what COVID did.
[02:35:10.958 --> 02:35:12.499]  I got emails from farmers.
[02:35:12.559 --> 02:35:13.940]  They had to kill 30,000 chickens.
[02:35:14.060 --> 02:35:25.805]  I'm not a top economist world famous like you, but I said four years ago, I said shutting down production and food production is going to cause massive shortages and lead to accelerated inflation and civil unrest.
[02:35:26.405 --> 02:35:28.786]  And then it's like so obvious.
[02:35:30.987 --> 02:35:32.108]  They don't have that.
[02:35:32.388 --> 02:35:34.429]  They're sitting there in their own little bubble.
[02:35:35.089 --> 02:35:36.750]  And they're mostly academics.
[02:35:37.626 --> 02:35:49.932]  And this is what I've encountered, that they are just there and they believe in the Keynesian model, that the government has the power to steer us through everything.
[02:35:50.332 --> 02:35:51.033]  And they're wrong.
[02:35:51.593 --> 02:35:53.053]  That's what's coming down.
[02:35:54.914 --> 02:35:56.195]  Powell understands.
[02:35:56.655 --> 02:35:56.955]  All right.
[02:35:57.135 --> 02:36:02.498]  And that's why he came out in December and said this spending is unsustainable.
[02:36:02.798 --> 02:36:04.379]  He raises interest rates.
[02:36:05.265 --> 02:36:05.966]  All right, fine.
[02:36:06.006 --> 02:36:07.186]  Maybe you buy less.
[02:36:07.927 --> 02:36:10.349]  All right.
[02:36:10.549 --> 02:36:11.689]  What happens with government?
[02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:16.132]  Do politicians say, oh, gee, he wants us to spend less money.
[02:36:16.192 --> 02:36:17.453]  Let's reduce our spending.
[02:36:17.734 --> 02:36:18.074]  Never.
[02:36:18.094 --> 02:36:19.335]  All right.
[02:36:19.415 --> 02:36:23.577]  The interest expenditures now are over a trillion dollars.
[02:36:24.118 --> 02:36:27.980]  The national debt when Ronald Reagan came to power was one trillion.
[02:36:29.241 --> 02:36:29.561]  All right.
[02:36:29.922 --> 02:36:31.363]  We're not getting out of this.
[02:36:32.361 --> 02:36:35.152]  You can't, you know, I have a solution how to do it.
[02:36:35.614 --> 02:36:36.357]  But, you know.
[02:36:37.495 --> 02:36:40.578]  I would basically, you know... That's my next question.
[02:36:40.598 --> 02:36:41.478]  That's my next question.
[02:36:41.819 --> 02:36:43.760]  You're a really smart guy, very well respected.
[02:36:44.341 --> 02:36:45.662]  Is there a way to land the plane?
[02:36:45.682 --> 02:36:47.043]  I know it's going to crash, but it's survivable.
[02:36:47.723 --> 02:36:53.648]  If you were the IMF, the World Bank, the WF, the UN, the Globalist, you know, BlackRock, what would you be doing?
[02:36:53.668 --> 02:36:56.630]  Because obviously, they're building a world where they're the villain, they get destroyed.
[02:36:56.650 --> 02:37:00.153]  They think they're going to, like, blow the economy up, consolidate power mindlessly.
[02:37:00.493 --> 02:37:02.715]  No, they're building their own tomb, in my view.
[02:37:03.216 --> 02:37:04.817]  How would you, if you were them, what would you do?
[02:37:06.913 --> 02:37:12.914]  I would treat it the same way when I get called in to deal with a company that's in trouble.
[02:37:13.454 --> 02:37:16.355]  You do a debt-to-equity swap.
[02:37:17.315 --> 02:37:19.375]  And I propose this to them.
[02:37:20.576 --> 02:37:21.916]  We issue coupons.
[02:37:22.616 --> 02:37:24.697]  You've got a 30-year bond here.
[02:37:24.797 --> 02:37:30.318]  You get this coupon, we redeem the 30-year bond, and government never borrows again.
[02:37:30.818 --> 02:37:32.018]  You take that coupon,
[02:37:33.562 --> 02:37:38.906]  And then you can go to, you know, Merrill Lynch or whoever, and then you can buy corporate bonds or private stock.
[02:37:39.207 --> 02:37:40.368]  It must be domestic.
[02:37:41.208 --> 02:37:41.549]  All right.
[02:37:41.889 --> 02:37:51.496]  If you took $34 trillion, you basically make that available for new jobs, new companies.
[02:37:51.977 --> 02:37:56.220]  You wanted to float a company, but, you know, they say, gee, there's not enough money.
[02:37:57.201 --> 02:37:57.982]  Now there is.
[02:37:58.522 --> 02:38:02.005]  You would create the biggest economic boom in history.
[02:38:02.694 --> 02:38:02.974]  All right.
[02:38:03.135 --> 02:38:07.059]  You have to make sure the government no longer is allowed to borrow.
[02:38:07.119 --> 02:38:07.499]  Period.
[02:38:08.180 --> 02:38:08.981]  All right.
[02:38:09.001 --> 02:38:14.526]  And because the problem is we're in this socialistic agenda of Marx.
[02:38:16.141 --> 02:38:20.602]  I need to run for election and people don't really understand what happens.
[02:38:21.302 --> 02:38:21.602]  All right.
[02:38:22.222 --> 02:38:26.143]  I, you know, as you know, I've been dealing with governments for a long time.
[02:38:26.723 --> 02:38:30.444]  I could run for office and say whatever you want me to say.
[02:38:30.884 --> 02:38:32.044]  I'll save the whales.
[02:38:32.124 --> 02:38:32.824]  I'll do this.
[02:38:33.284 --> 02:38:33.644]  Whatever.
[02:38:33.664 --> 02:38:34.684]  All right.
[02:38:34.764 --> 02:38:36.185]  I'll forgive your tuition.
[02:38:37.145 --> 02:38:39.425]  I'll give you reparations.
[02:38:39.465 --> 02:38:39.845]  Whatever.
[02:38:41.026 --> 02:38:42.866]  And I get to Washington.
[02:38:43.966 --> 02:38:48.728]  And it doesn't matter Democrat, Republican, there's a meeting the first day.
[02:38:49.188 --> 02:38:50.329]  Congratulations.
[02:38:50.449 --> 02:38:51.269]  Glad you're here.
[02:38:51.569 --> 02:38:52.790]  This is how it works.
[02:38:53.630 --> 02:38:56.151]  You will vote according to what we tell you.
[02:38:57.092 --> 02:39:00.253]  So what happens is just look at the voting record.
[02:39:00.893 --> 02:39:02.374]  It's usually down party lines.
[02:39:03.254 --> 02:39:08.416]  You know, there is no such thing as voting for somebody because they're going to be different than everybody else.
[02:39:09.037 --> 02:39:12.278]  If they do not comply, they do not get on a committee.
[02:39:13.274 --> 02:39:14.635]  You know, and there's no power.
[02:39:17.217 --> 02:39:21.641]  When the Tea Party got in there, you know, they refused.
[02:39:21.681 --> 02:39:26.725]  There was about 80 some that refused to follow Bonner.
[02:39:26.885 --> 02:39:27.245]  All right.
[02:39:27.806 --> 02:39:36.192]  He started removing them, made sure that anybody that supported them was was taken off various anything to do with the financial committee.
[02:39:37.113 --> 02:39:38.114]  It was retaliation.
[02:39:38.877 --> 02:39:40.758]  This is what goes on in Washington.
[02:39:41.838 --> 02:39:42.858]  It is so petty.
[02:39:44.579 --> 02:39:55.561]  When I got called in in 1985, they were forming the G5 and they were standing up and saying they were going to lower the value of the dollar by 40%.
[02:39:56.062 --> 02:39:57.322]  I said, you can't do this.
[02:39:58.582 --> 02:40:00.223]  I went out of committee.
[02:40:00.243 --> 02:40:01.183]  I wrote to Reagan.
[02:40:02.578 --> 02:40:07.901]  And I said, you do this, you're going to create a crash in two years, which turned out to be the 87 crash.
[02:40:08.361 --> 02:40:13.844]  But these people don't realize you just sold a third of the national debt to Japan at the time.
[02:40:14.505 --> 02:40:16.466]  And you have all these foreigners buying U.S.
[02:40:16.586 --> 02:40:17.006]  assets.
[02:40:17.446 --> 02:40:19.908]  You lower the value of the dollar by 40 percent.
[02:40:20.008 --> 02:40:20.328]  Fine.
[02:40:20.368 --> 02:40:23.670]  You might be able to sell a car cheaper overseas now.
[02:40:24.070 --> 02:40:28.813]  But then any foreign investor in the United States loses 40 percent and they all sold.
[02:40:30.100 --> 02:40:32.101]  You know, they don't understand the economy.
[02:40:52.316 --> 02:40:56.217]  Stay away from any government debt, federal, state, or local.
[02:40:56.597 --> 02:40:57.397]  Stay away from that.
[02:40:57.797 --> 02:40:58.177]  All right?
[02:40:58.497 --> 02:41:00.238]  The stock market probably will go up.
[02:41:00.378 --> 02:41:01.898]  Same thing with gold, etc.
[02:41:01.938 --> 02:41:10.740]  When people begin to realize that we're at a point in time where the confidence in government is collapsing, not the private sector.
[02:41:11.560 --> 02:41:11.920]  All right?
[02:41:12.540 --> 02:41:13.760]  Just ask yourself this.
[02:41:14.141 --> 02:41:20.222]  You really want to sell all your stocks and go buy government bonds and a flight to quality when they're going to create a war for 10 years?
[02:41:20.942 --> 02:41:21.162]  I mean,
[02:41:22.020 --> 02:41:23.102]  You know, you don't do that.
[02:41:23.802 --> 02:41:27.087]  It's the exact opposite of what a lot of these people are saying.
[02:41:27.759 --> 02:41:30.640]  So, you know, we're going to be going into a recession.
[02:41:31.180 --> 02:41:36.202]  It's going to be more like stagflation, because as you also go in the war, what happens?
[02:41:36.242 --> 02:41:37.522]  You end up with shortages.
[02:41:37.903 --> 02:41:46.366]  There'll probably be capital controls, particularly for Europe, when they realize that people want to get their money out to put capital controls so you can't.
[02:41:47.726 --> 02:41:52.728]  This is, you know, the world we're in, and they're going to get more authoritarian
[02:41:53.448 --> 02:41:57.752]  Particularly after this election, you're going to see a rise in civil unrest.
[02:41:59.413 --> 02:42:00.994]  Nobody's going to accept the winner.
[02:42:01.635 --> 02:42:02.476]  I don't care who it is.
[02:42:06.098 --> 02:42:06.439]  Wow.
[02:42:07.399 --> 02:42:08.560]  It's positive to know the truth.
[02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:09.962]  I think you're overall right.
[02:42:10.042 --> 02:42:10.882]  I think you're totally right.
[02:42:10.902 --> 02:42:12.844]  The question is, what's the spectrum there?
[02:42:13.524 --> 02:42:14.906]  What is your advice to President Trump?
[02:42:19.685 --> 02:42:24.407]  He's got a shot to basically reduce the volatility with war.
[02:42:25.268 --> 02:42:27.549]  But it's probably only going to postpone until 2027.
[02:42:27.709 --> 02:42:39.535]  Either we go into war now and the peak of its 2027 or if Trump can get in and you can shut it down.
[02:42:40.836 --> 02:42:44.119]  And the main thing is you've got to sit on top of NATO.
[02:42:44.519 --> 02:42:50.484]  My concern is that they will... Plan B is to start some sort of war before he gets in.
[02:42:50.504 --> 02:42:51.044]  I agree.
[02:42:51.445 --> 02:42:53.746]  So to trap him so he cannot exit.
[02:42:53.827 --> 02:42:54.287]  Oh, that's clear.
[02:42:54.307 --> 02:42:57.229]  They want to accelerate the war to a level where he can't get out.
[02:42:58.670 --> 02:42:59.211]  Exactly.
[02:42:59.311 --> 02:43:02.233]  Before the election or certainly before January.
[02:43:02.693 --> 02:43:04.415]  So what do we do to help Trump stop that?
[02:43:06.486 --> 02:43:08.627]  Basically, just you really support him.
[02:43:08.687 --> 02:43:13.431]  I mean, even RFK, I was, you know, going back and forth between the two of them.
[02:43:13.451 --> 02:43:18.775]  I was trying to get RFK to accept the Attorney General position, not VP.
[02:43:19.776 --> 02:43:21.457]  His father was that.
[02:43:21.597 --> 02:43:29.003]  And my argument is that, you know, that if he did that, he could indict Pfizer.
[02:43:30.264 --> 02:43:32.306]  Attorney General has absolute immunity.
[02:43:33.367 --> 02:43:37.150]  Oh, I mean, he's as powerful as the President, if you take out the military aspect.
[02:43:39.612 --> 02:43:40.733]  Probably more so.
[02:43:41.214 --> 02:43:42.795]  The President could at least be sued.
[02:43:44.236 --> 02:43:46.218]  The Attorney General cannot, alright?
[02:43:46.258 --> 02:43:52.763]  So, you want to basically try and save the world, write to him and say, hey, take the Attorney General, please.
[02:43:54.184 --> 02:43:56.046]  I think Trump would be a better President.
[02:43:57.106 --> 02:44:00.451]  And VP really doesn't much matter.
[02:44:01.071 --> 02:44:02.613]  They're just kind of a placeholder.
[02:44:02.653 --> 02:44:06.418]  But that's what I would really kind of look at.
[02:44:06.438 --> 02:44:06.498]  And
[02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:18.890]  I understand that we are facing a very serious crossroads here, and they are looking at this stage in the game for war to keep their power.
[02:44:19.090 --> 02:44:19.490]  That's right.
[02:44:19.710 --> 02:44:23.474]  And Trump getting in, the neocons are out of everything.
[02:44:24.054 --> 02:44:25.255]  ArmstrongEconomics.com.
[02:44:25.355 --> 02:44:26.116]  Everybody check it out.
[02:44:26.156 --> 02:44:27.958]  Martin Armstrong, thank you so much for the time, sir.
[02:44:29.639 --> 02:44:30.100]  Thank you.
[02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:31.421]  It's always a pleasure to see you.
[02:44:31.601 --> 02:44:31.941]  Thank you.
[02:44:31.981 --> 02:44:32.502]  We'll be right back.
[02:44:34.448 --> 02:44:47.639]  Well, people don't know, by the way, so, you know, and I'll say this again, that many moons ago, when I was just getting started in all of this, that I remember I used to come on with Alex in 2016 is when we started doing it.
[02:44:47.960 --> 02:44:49.461]  Met you at the RNC in Cleveland.
[02:44:49.501 --> 02:44:51.082]  We did the rally by the river.
[02:44:51.102 --> 02:44:51.543]  Yeah.
[02:44:52.123 --> 02:44:53.404]  With Roger and everyone's there.
[02:44:53.985 --> 02:44:55.406]  And Diamond and Silk were there.
[02:44:55.426 --> 02:44:56.047]  That was great.
[02:44:56.067 --> 02:45:01.291]  We're out here, despite all the threats, exercising your sacred First Amendment.
[02:45:01.371 --> 02:45:02.032]  We salute you!
[02:45:02.652 --> 02:45:06.058]  Impro Wars salutes you, and you are part of history.
[02:45:06.258 --> 02:45:07.140]  You are the future.
[02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:07.761]  God bless you.
[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:17.463]  Back then, even before I was at One America, I used to host Hour Four.
[02:45:17.863 --> 02:45:18.364]  You remember that?
[02:45:18.564 --> 02:45:18.744]  Yeah.
[02:45:19.245 --> 02:45:21.506]  And you'd be like, I didn't even know you back then!
[02:45:21.646 --> 02:45:24.609]  And you were, I was just some guy, and you were like, hey, your microphone's not good.
[02:45:24.649 --> 02:45:38.199]  So guys, Alex Jones sends me my first microphone that I've got set up in like a, just like a spare bedroom in the house, and I'm doing it over my laptop, and he goes, oh yeah, yeah, I need someone to host Hour Four.
[02:45:38.239 --> 02:45:39.820]  So I'm like, get in there, just do it.
[02:45:39.840 --> 02:45:40.901]  He's like, what do you want me to talk about?
[02:45:41.181 --> 02:45:42.302]  It's whatever you like, I gotta go.
[02:45:42.702 --> 02:45:45.704]  And I'm like, I'm just some guy at that point.
[02:45:46.365 --> 02:45:48.426]  I had been through 2016, we had met, etc, etc.
[02:45:48.486 --> 02:45:49.747]  No, but you were a smart guy.
[02:45:50.087 --> 02:45:56.312]  But my point though is that people don't realize how much Alex does behind the scenes to help people.
[02:45:56.592 --> 02:46:07.240]  People don't realize how much that Alex is just generous with his time, generous with his resources, and by the way, spends time with your family.
[02:46:07.940 --> 02:46:18.508]  And, you know, something that I've always tried to say is, like, there's this media caricature of Alex Jones, and I'm like, that's not the guy that I've ever met.
[02:46:18.628 --> 02:46:19.609]  I've never met him.
[02:46:19.729 --> 02:46:21.030]  I've spent plenty of time with him.
[02:46:21.390 --> 02:46:22.911]  I've never met this guy.
[02:46:23.311 --> 02:46:24.492]  He sounds crazy.
[02:46:24.532 --> 02:46:28.655]  I don't know that I'd want to meet the guy that they take you out to be, because that's just not you.
[02:46:28.755 --> 02:46:35.580]  And so, I mean, I just want to take the opportunity real quick to just say thank you for all the help that you gave me when I was getting started.
[02:46:35.680 --> 02:46:36.460]  Well, thank you, Jack.
[02:46:36.500 --> 02:46:41.361]  But it was because you were like, I was just, you know, you were a talented, smart guy and making great points.
[02:46:41.381 --> 02:46:43.762]  I'm like, well, hey, you need to get on air and you need more.
[02:46:44.122 --> 02:46:44.842]  We're going to go to break.
[02:46:44.882 --> 02:46:45.662]  He's going to take over.
[02:46:45.682 --> 02:46:47.583]  I haven't plugged in three hours.
[02:46:47.643 --> 02:46:48.683]  If we don't do that, we'll be gone.
[02:46:48.703 --> 02:46:50.463]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:50.503 --> 02:46:51.124]  Big sale.

[02:46:58.666 --> 02:47:00.707]  My dad two years ago said they're going to shut you down.
[02:47:01.087 --> 02:47:02.868]  He went, he already developed the supplements.
[02:47:03.168 --> 02:47:04.849]  He went and set up a warehouse in North Austin.
[02:47:05.169 --> 02:47:06.310]  He's there and he was right.
[02:47:06.790 --> 02:47:08.351]  So great products there.
[02:47:08.371 --> 02:47:11.252]  We've got the next level foundational energy.
[02:47:11.873 --> 02:47:15.675]  We've got the 10-hour clean energy turbo force and all the nano silver products.
[02:47:16.255 --> 02:47:19.277]  We've got the rocket rest sleep in so amazing.
[02:47:19.297 --> 02:47:19.757]  We've got the
[02:47:20.357 --> 02:47:23.399]  Alex, when you're working hard and you've got a bunch of back-to-back flights, what's good?
[02:47:23.419 --> 02:47:24.099]  What should I go for?
[02:47:39.968 --> 02:47:41.129]  I haven't taken any today.
[02:47:41.210 --> 02:47:42.871]  I should have, because I was up until 2 a.m.
[02:47:42.911 --> 02:47:43.411]  last night.
[02:47:44.192 --> 02:47:45.453]  But they're all excellent.
[02:47:45.473 --> 02:47:46.334]  They're all just clones.
[02:47:46.354 --> 02:47:47.455]  I've already met so many guys.
[02:47:47.595 --> 02:47:49.777]  I want to get some before I get back on that plane.
[02:47:49.797 --> 02:47:50.417]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:47:50.437 --> 02:47:52.599]  Okay, well, I'm going to tell you right now what you want.
[02:47:52.619 --> 02:47:53.440]  So I can keep rocking and rolling.
[02:47:53.460 --> 02:47:55.081]  I'm going to tell you what you want right now.
[02:47:55.242 --> 02:47:55.462]  Yeah?
[02:47:56.222 --> 02:47:57.904]  You want... No, that's Rocket Rush.
[02:47:57.944 --> 02:47:58.584]  You need to sleep.
[02:47:58.684 --> 02:47:59.265]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:47:59.765 --> 02:48:00.726]  Well, I will take that later tonight.
[02:48:00.766 --> 02:48:01.287]  You want...
[02:48:02.699 --> 02:48:03.941]  Next level foundational energy.
[02:48:04.501 --> 02:48:04.842]  There it is.
[02:48:04.882 --> 02:48:05.302]  Let me see.
[02:48:05.342 --> 02:48:06.664]  And there's no speed in that.
[02:48:06.924 --> 02:48:08.366]  It's a methyl folate to break down.
[02:48:08.386 --> 02:48:09.086]  Oh, wow.
[02:48:09.767 --> 02:48:10.208]  Oh, yeah.
[02:48:10.308 --> 02:48:13.391]  It's methyl folate to break down of what's in spinach.
[02:48:13.411 --> 02:48:14.733]  There's a lot in here, too, by the way.
[02:48:14.753 --> 02:48:15.253]  Methyl folate acid.
[02:48:15.293 --> 02:48:15.614]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:48:15.734 --> 02:48:16.495]  There's a ton in here.
[02:48:16.555 --> 02:48:17.776]  The point is, it's a great product.
[02:48:18.177 --> 02:48:21.741]  This isn't one of the ones where they, you know, put the cotton in on the top so you only get a little bit.
[02:48:21.761 --> 02:48:22.261]  This is full.
[02:48:22.602 --> 02:48:23.483]  You're nice to support us.
[02:48:32.571 --> 02:48:35.933]  All right, final segment, Maria Z all the way from Australia in studio.
[02:48:35.973 --> 02:48:39.535]  Coming up, please stay with us for that and share the link, share the way we reach more people.
[02:48:40.836 --> 02:48:45.258]  Jam in a call from Kelly and then Casey, who held over our amazing guest, Martin Armstrong.
[02:48:46.038 --> 02:48:49.100]  Yeah, it's negative, some of the stuff we said, but he's, the guy's really smart.
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:50.381]  He's dead on, actually.
[02:48:50.421 --> 02:48:52.382]  So, where we are, we're just getting ready here.
[02:48:53.444 --> 02:48:54.324]  We didn't ask for this.
[02:48:54.384 --> 02:48:56.565]  I didn't want this, but it's where we're sitting.
[02:48:57.625 --> 02:49:04.188]  Like he says in that scene with the cop before Tony Montana shoots him, he says, it's your tree, Frank.
[02:49:04.208 --> 02:49:04.808]  You're sitting in it.
[02:49:05.448 --> 02:49:08.509]  He goes, Mal, you fucked up too, Mal.
[02:49:09.189 --> 02:49:09.709]  What do you mean?
[02:49:09.729 --> 02:49:10.950]  You can't kill a cop, Tony.
[02:49:10.970 --> 02:49:12.971]  I mean, that's where we are, folks.
[02:49:13.011 --> 02:49:14.311]  This stuff is going downhill quick.
[02:49:14.911 --> 02:49:16.232]  Let's talk to Kelly in Ohio.
[02:49:16.272 --> 02:49:16.772]  You're on the air.
[02:49:16.812 --> 02:49:17.112]  Go ahead.
[02:49:18.635 --> 02:49:19.115]  Hey, Alex.
[02:49:19.235 --> 02:49:21.636]  Hey, I've done a new way to nationally fundraise for you.
[02:49:21.656 --> 02:49:22.616]  I will keep it legit.
[02:49:23.096 --> 02:49:23.616]  I don't know.
[02:49:23.636 --> 02:49:25.636]  I'm not a tax consultant.
[02:49:25.696 --> 02:49:27.657]  I don't know about business taxes, etc.
[02:49:28.117 --> 02:49:29.077]  But here's my idea.
[02:49:29.097 --> 02:49:38.979]  I wish, along with many of your listeners, to support your enterprise or you or whatever you need to have funded for your company to continue on.
[02:49:39.219 --> 02:49:41.780]  Or if you have to make a new entity, that's another situation.
[02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:42.700]  But here we go.
[02:49:43.100 --> 02:49:47.061]  I don't want my debit or credit card or bank account subjected to the illegal scrutiny or
[02:49:48.010 --> 02:49:49.713]  I don't claim it.
[02:49:49.733 --> 02:49:50.013]  It's true.
[02:50:06.087 --> 02:50:07.208]  Okay, well, that's what I mean.
[02:50:07.368 --> 02:50:08.049]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:50:08.169 --> 02:50:09.511]  I mean... No, it's okay.
[02:50:09.551 --> 02:50:10.432]  Go ahead.
[02:50:10.832 --> 02:50:15.056]  Okay, so what needs to be addressed and tapped into is your viewership and listenership.
[02:50:15.337 --> 02:50:21.123]  We'd definitely financially support you if they could, but make donations or whatever, and the correct terminology would be in cash.
[02:50:21.543 --> 02:50:24.286]  Here's a seed of a brainstorm I've been thinking about.
[02:50:24.686 --> 02:50:27.189]  Locally, take like Ohio, for example, where I am.
[02:50:27.540 --> 02:50:36.344]  Your organization, or let's say one that is established to benefit your organization, like your investigative reporters that you've not been able to keep on staff.
[02:50:36.945 --> 02:50:45.349]  You have to reduce... What you would do is you would need to identify a person or a coordinator for this particular project.
[02:50:46.755 --> 02:51:00.123]  Sure, they saw the excitement, they decided to get excited.
[02:51:01.404 --> 02:51:06.246]  The difference is, if people don't even just buy the products, how am I supposed to set up coordinators and do all this?
[02:51:06.306 --> 02:51:07.387]  I mean, sure, I can try that.
[02:51:07.407 --> 02:51:12.630]  I'm not saying it's a bad idea, but in a few-minute call, it's really hard to extrapolate all that out.
[02:51:13.638 --> 02:51:14.458]  Those are the ideas.
[02:51:14.578 --> 02:51:18.300]  And I'm using as Ohio's example, a recognizable grassroots organization.
[02:51:18.320 --> 02:51:22.421]  Somebody that has a face, at least has a face, on your program so we can recognize it.
[02:51:22.441 --> 02:51:26.083]  Do travel stops along the interstate.
[02:51:26.223 --> 02:51:27.983]  You see 70 and 75 intersect Ohio.
[02:51:28.023 --> 02:51:29.124]  Kind of put in a quadrant.
[02:51:29.504 --> 02:51:31.104]  They're not equal size, but whatever.
[02:51:31.465 --> 02:51:32.125]  No, no.
[02:51:32.185 --> 02:51:32.605]  I hear you.
[02:51:32.625 --> 02:51:34.026]  Send me an email with your idea.
[02:51:34.066 --> 02:51:34.746]  Thank you so much.
[02:51:35.186 --> 02:51:35.926]  Thank you, Kelly.
[02:51:36.206 --> 02:51:37.127]  Casey, last caller.
[02:51:37.167 --> 02:51:38.507]  Go ahead before Maria Z takes over.
[02:51:39.588 --> 02:51:39.988]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:51:41.522 --> 02:51:43.163]  About the assassination attempt.
[02:51:45.144 --> 02:51:56.949]  I don't know if you've seen those aerial photographs of the roof of Crooks lying on the roof before the law enforcement got up there.
[02:51:58.630 --> 02:51:58.870]  Yeah.
[02:51:58.970 --> 02:52:04.973]  Why was the gun eight to ten feet away from him if he was shooting at the president?
[02:52:05.573 --> 02:52:06.794]  None of this makes sense.
[02:52:06.854 --> 02:52:07.734]  It's all a cover-up.
[02:52:08.255 --> 02:52:08.875]  It's all coming out.
[02:52:09.639 --> 02:52:11.620]  Yeah, well, you want to hear my take?
[02:52:11.640 --> 02:52:12.101]  Sure!
[02:52:13.241 --> 02:52:15.603]  Alright, well, about the gun.
[02:52:15.703 --> 02:52:19.445]  First, his handlers had the gun a few days before the shooting.
[02:52:20.146 --> 02:52:28.371]  They shot off about, you know, a dozen or so rounds just to make sure they had enough casings to spread around after the fact.
[02:52:29.572 --> 02:52:38.438]  And before they stashed the gun for crooks to pick up, they removed the firing pin because they knew he couldn't hit the broad side of a barn.
[02:52:40.370 --> 02:52:47.911]  So he gets his orders to go to the AGR building and to await further orders.
[02:52:47.951 --> 02:52:57.573]  That's why he's walking around looking suspicious, you know, and people taking videos of him, you know, probably fed up.
[02:52:57.593 --> 02:52:58.393]  We're almost out of time.
[02:52:58.413 --> 02:52:58.833]  What happened?
[02:52:59.934 --> 02:53:05.415]  Um, anyway, so he finally gets the orders to go up, climb up on the roof.
[02:53:05.995 --> 02:53:07.715]  So on the way up there, he grabs the gun.
[02:53:08.502 --> 02:53:18.725]  He gets up there and they told him to make damn sure that, you know, he gets everything right to use the rangefinder, you know, check the wind and everything.
[02:53:19.005 --> 02:53:23.587]  But they told him that to stall him while the real sniper took the shot.
[02:53:23.687 --> 02:53:24.947]  No, that has probably happened.
[02:53:24.967 --> 02:53:25.867]  I think you're probably right.
[02:53:41.623 --> 02:53:45.763]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:53:53.895 --> 02:54:12.824]  And I looked, and behold, a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him, and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth.
[02:54:13.504 --> 02:54:15.145]  In the words of William Cooper,
[02:54:16.025 --> 02:54:19.727]  Author of Behold a Pale Horse, we have been taught lies.
[02:54:20.308 --> 02:54:23.329]  Reality is not at all what we perceive it to be.
[02:54:23.850 --> 02:54:37.017]  Altering that reality, Thomas Jolly, the artistic director for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, brought the world this cheap smut we all had to endure.
[02:54:37.297 --> 02:54:44.902]  Jolly once directed a 24-hour production of Shakespeare, so the next logical step was to mock God.
[02:54:45.442 --> 02:54:47.943]  At the 2024 Paris Olympics.
[02:54:48.524 --> 02:54:52.426]  Smack in the face of every human being on earth with an idiot box.
[02:54:52.646 --> 02:54:54.827]  I don't know what y'all talking about, but this is the GOAT.
[02:54:55.808 --> 02:54:56.828]  Greatest of all time.
[02:54:57.909 --> 02:54:59.269]  With a blue diamond on his head.
[02:54:59.650 --> 02:54:59.930]  GOAT.
[02:55:00.590 --> 02:55:00.830]  GOAT.
[02:55:01.631 --> 02:55:02.391]  Dog is the GOAT.
[02:55:02.991 --> 02:55:04.112]  Represent peace and love.
[02:55:12.962 --> 02:55:33.095]  With all of the swine of the New World Order in attendance, sitting like hogs over a Berkshire trough, the 2024 UN World Economic Forum Bilderberg event instantly resonated with tyrannical Olympiads of similar auspicious periods throughout human history.
[02:55:33.775 --> 02:55:36.798]  The Olympic Games could not have been going better for Hitler.
[02:55:37.358 --> 02:55:52.890]  Despite the success of Jesse Owens, Germany were leading the medal table, presiding over essential food shortages for the Olympic athletes, followed by a power outage in the City of Lights that rocked Macron's spectacle of Maird on day one.
[02:55:53.451 --> 02:55:56.954]  Oddly enough, that should be the least of anyone's worries.
[02:55:57.514 --> 02:55:58.275]  Pre-Olympics,
[02:55:58.735 --> 02:56:09.659]  Four attacks in what the French government called Coordinated Malicious Acts targeted links to the east, north and west of Paris, taking out huge swathes of the network.
[02:56:10.519 --> 02:56:18.042]  Paris is already on high alert amid concerns about potential Russian cyber attacks and actions by violent Islamist groups.
[02:56:18.860 --> 02:56:29.887]  A police investigation is underway tonight after an Australian woman came forward saying that she had been raped by several men on a night out here in the party precinct in Paris.
[02:56:29.947 --> 02:56:34.309]  All of this coming just days out from the Olympic opening ceremony.
[02:56:34.530 --> 02:56:36.651]  And robbery of the Olympic athletes.
[02:56:37.551 --> 02:56:38.392]  Crazy start to the trip.
[02:56:41.703 --> 02:56:42.884]  Make sure you sanitize that thing.
[02:56:42.904 --> 02:56:44.345]  I don't want to lay on that later.
[02:56:45.006 --> 02:56:57.256]  The Telegraph reported that France had foiled four different plots to sabotage the Olympics over the last few weeks, according to the French Interior Minister, who gave no additional details.
[02:56:57.677 --> 02:57:08.486]  While the threat of terror attacks looms large as radicalized inhabitants of the French no-go zones plot in the shadow of the New World Order's Paris, France.
[02:57:08.886 --> 02:57:20.490]  We address to the people of France and to French President Macron, rivers of blood will flow through the streets of Paris.
[02:57:21.451 --> 02:57:27.893]  Meanwhile, the opening ceremony revealed Paris Olympic security is on every angle, making the U.S.'
[02:57:27.853 --> 02:57:29.734]  's Secret Service look bush league.
[02:57:30.114 --> 02:57:37.237]  The spectacle of the opening ceremonies providing a perfect distraction to the real threat on the ground.
[02:57:37.857 --> 02:57:49.626]  Yet nothing can distract from the potential death of a female boxer by a male posing as a female that has now weaseled its way into the Olympic Games via Marxist lunacy.
[02:57:49.906 --> 02:57:53.749]  Even as Thomas Jolly and crew respond to the backlash.
[02:57:54.149 --> 02:58:00.194]  If people have taken any offense, we are of course really, really sorry.
[02:58:00.434 --> 02:58:01.335]  Learning the hard way.
[02:58:01.735 --> 02:58:03.016]  God is not mocked.
[02:58:03.616 --> 02:58:05.698]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.
[02:58:07.298 --> 02:58:09.679]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:58:09.799 --> 02:58:17.123]  I'm your guest host, Maria Z, reporting to you live in studio from Texas.
[02:58:17.223 --> 02:58:18.744]  Yes, I am in Texas.
[02:58:18.804 --> 02:58:27.109]  I'm going to be here for at least the next few months because this upcoming election is going to affect the whole world.
[02:58:27.169 --> 02:58:33.192]  Right now in Australia, you would all know because I've been reporting on the madness in that country.
[02:58:33.812 --> 02:58:40.233]  It is absolutely impacted by the left wing lunacy that we are seeing in the United States.
[02:58:40.273 --> 02:58:47.855]  And so this next election is instrumental, not just for my country of origin, but for the entire world.
[02:58:47.915 --> 02:58:52.296]  The entire world is influenced by what happens here.
[02:58:52.376 --> 02:58:53.376]  And they are desperate.
[02:58:53.436 --> 02:58:58.397]  They are desperate to destroy America because it is the leader of the West.
[02:58:58.437 --> 02:59:01.078]  They are desperate to make it
[02:59:02.398 --> 02:59:08.220]  A clown show, and that is certainly what has been seen over the past few months.
[02:59:08.280 --> 02:59:19.363]  When we see Transgender Visibility Day on the day of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, celebrated above the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[02:59:19.643 --> 02:59:25.305]  When we see lunatics on the White House lawn flashing their fake
[02:59:26.665 --> 02:59:34.370]  Uh, you know, woman's chest that they've constructed pretending that they're another sex, which you can't be.
[02:59:36.571 --> 02:59:39.293]  This has infected the entire West.
[02:59:40.646 --> 02:59:56.879]  Let me tell you, you know, I've spoken about this before, but recently in Australia, we had a Member of Parliament talking about how transgender people need to be able, they need to have the right to change their gender after they're dead.
[02:59:59.181 --> 03:00:03.805]  Transgender people need to have the right to change their gender after they're dead.
[03:00:04.265 --> 03:00:08.008]  This is a reflection of the maniacs
[03:00:09.056 --> 03:00:15.500]  This is a reflection of the lunacy that we just saw at the Olympics.
[03:00:15.560 --> 03:00:25.426]  And guys, as I'm talking about this, if you wouldn't mind bringing up some of those images from the Olympics, the blue man has apologized and said that it was all just a big misunderstanding.
[03:00:25.526 --> 03:00:26.607]  He didn't mean to
[03:00:29.216 --> 03:00:29.756]  I think so.
[03:00:45.117 --> 03:00:48.860]  They attempted to mock Jesus Christ and what did they receive?
[03:00:48.880 --> 03:00:55.044]  They received worldwide contempt and backlash to the point where they now have to issue public apologies.
[03:00:55.344 --> 03:00:56.705]  It was never our intention.
[03:00:56.825 --> 03:00:57.186]  Really?
[03:00:57.266 --> 03:00:59.627]  Why'd you do it then if it wasn't your intention?
[03:01:00.068 --> 03:01:02.589]  Let's just take a minute to consider.
[03:01:03.110 --> 03:01:08.654]  Yes, this is the obese lady that apparently embodies elite athletes.
[03:01:10.315 --> 03:01:11.456]  What is she representing?
[03:01:12.136 --> 03:01:12.757]  Diabetes?
[03:01:14.414 --> 03:01:19.497]  This is not, this does not celebrate elite athletes.
[03:01:19.557 --> 03:01:24.120]  The Olympics, an event that used to be revered by the whole world, but they want to destroy that too.
[03:01:24.460 --> 03:01:27.763]  And the participants in the Olympics, how do they feel about this?
[03:01:28.303 --> 03:01:32.245]  How do they feel about the fact that they train day in, day out,
[03:01:33.166 --> 03:01:42.271]  Particularly the women, I don't know if they haven't been overtaken by men yet in their sport that they train and sacrifice their entire lives to participate in.
[03:01:42.591 --> 03:02:00.181]  But how do they feel about the fact that they eat incredibly specific meals and consider every single calorie and train day in, day out to attend this prestigious event?
[03:02:01.275 --> 03:02:04.727]  What used to be prestigious before they crapped all over it.
[03:02:06.431 --> 03:02:14.478]  To be viewing this at the opening ceremony, something they've tried to scrub from the internet.
[03:02:14.518 --> 03:02:15.459]  They want to pull it all down.
[03:02:15.499 --> 03:02:17.440]  And by the way, they say it's for copyright.
[03:02:17.981 --> 03:02:25.748]  But team, if you could bring up that screenshot, which shows that the video was removed by the owner.
[03:02:25.788 --> 03:02:27.549]  They removed their own video.
[03:02:28.330 --> 03:02:29.491]  They removed their own video.
[03:02:29.511 --> 03:02:32.453]  It's not copyright that they've removed it for.
[03:02:33.482 --> 03:02:37.784]  It's because of the backlash, because people are disgusted in what they're seeing.
[03:02:37.904 --> 03:02:44.647]  And, you know, I'm going to apologize to you all that you've got this on your screens, but it's important that you see it.
[03:02:46.788 --> 03:02:47.369]  Yeah.
[03:02:47.469 --> 03:02:48.889]  Opening ceremony highlights.
[03:02:50.690 --> 03:02:51.231]  Olympics.
[03:02:53.632 --> 03:02:55.112]  This video is not available.
[03:02:55.152 --> 03:03:00.055]  Well, it's not a copyright issue when it's your own video, you maniacs.
[03:03:01.223 --> 03:03:06.765]  They've removed it because of the backlash and yes of course they're saying now we didn't mean to offend anyone and it wasn't.
[03:03:07.725 --> 03:03:10.266]  We weren't intending on mocking The Last Supper.
[03:03:10.286 --> 03:03:18.389]  We weren't intending on waving Satan in your face and seeing how far we can push this lunacy.
[03:03:18.409 --> 03:03:27.492]  We weren't intending to let the world know that we hate Jesus and we love Satan
[03:03:29.082 --> 03:03:33.865]  And see whether they're all willing to accept that yet or not.
[03:03:34.265 --> 03:03:35.106]  Well, guess what?
[03:03:35.926 --> 03:03:36.567]  They weren't.
[03:03:37.928 --> 03:03:39.569]  They weren't willing to accept it.
[03:03:39.589 --> 03:03:41.510]  Yes, the golden calf, of course.
[03:03:42.530 --> 03:03:45.532]  The symbolism there of the idolatry.
[03:03:45.552 --> 03:03:57.660]  I really want to know how these elite athletes that train their whole lives feel coming to perform after this utter garbage.
[03:04:00.899 --> 03:04:01.739]  Utter garbage.
[03:04:01.779 --> 03:04:02.599]  That's enough, guys.
[03:04:02.859 --> 03:04:04.040]  You don't have to keep playing it.
[03:04:04.100 --> 03:04:06.840]  People know how disgusting this was.
[03:04:07.660 --> 03:04:08.621]  It's making me sick.
[03:04:10.721 --> 03:04:12.321]  But a wonderful thing happened.
[03:04:13.042 --> 03:04:14.962]  A wonderful thing happened, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:14.982 --> 03:04:18.323]  The world en masse rejected this.
[03:04:18.623 --> 03:04:29.025]  I even saw comments on social media from atheists, from Muslims, from people of all faiths saying, I am not a Christian, but this is absolutely disgusting.
[03:04:31.069 --> 03:04:34.111]  This is, you know, distasteful.
[03:04:34.531 --> 03:04:38.934]  Someone called it unimaginative.
[03:04:40.495 --> 03:04:41.976]  I don't think it's unimaginative.
[03:04:43.817 --> 03:04:45.958]  They know exactly what they've imagined.
[03:04:46.759 --> 03:04:57.606]  They've imagined a ceremony for their defeated, pathetic God that they're trying to usher into this world.
[03:04:59.295 --> 03:05:04.920]  For everyone to worship and accept the mark of the beast and they're conditioning you bit by bit by bit.
[03:05:04.960 --> 03:05:09.805]  This used to be something that we used to analyze and say, Oh, did you see that symbolism in this video clip?
[03:05:09.845 --> 03:05:12.728]  Or did you see that symbolism in this Hollywood movie?
[03:05:12.748 --> 03:05:23.017]  And we used to, we used to as, as conspiracy experts around the world, we used to sit here and analyze these things and say, Oh, you know, here's,
[03:05:23.698 --> 03:05:25.499]  There would be videos, whole videos on it.
[03:05:25.619 --> 03:05:33.885]  This was the hidden symbolism and this is what they meant by this and you've got 13 steps here, you know, Madonna walking down these steps and what does this mean?
[03:05:33.945 --> 03:05:37.127]  And this used to be something that people did.
[03:05:37.167 --> 03:05:46.412]  You don't have to do it anymore because you've got Sam Smith, I don't know, humping the devil at his concerts.
[03:05:46.753 --> 03:05:48.434]  They don't care anymore.
[03:05:50.219 --> 03:06:00.201]  And while it is disgusting and it needs to be called out, and the blue man has said, oh, I'm sure that Christians will forgive me because, you know, their religion is all about forgiveness.
[03:06:00.241 --> 03:06:14.725]  And it's so funny that you want to teach me about what my religion's all about after you've just absolutely mocked my Lord and Saviour at the opening ceremony of the Olympics, after you've tried your best
[03:06:17.642 --> 03:06:24.353]  To elevate a defeated foe above the Messiah.
[03:06:27.145 --> 03:06:30.327]  But you want to now tell me what my expectation as a Christian is?
[03:06:30.347 --> 03:06:30.847]  And you know what?
[03:06:30.887 --> 03:06:31.547]  Yes, we do.
[03:06:31.927 --> 03:06:33.328]  We do forgive as Christians.
[03:06:33.388 --> 03:06:34.909]  That is what we're told to do.
[03:06:34.949 --> 03:06:40.171]  But it does not mean that we will tolerate this degeneracy any longer in our society.
[03:06:41.072 --> 03:06:46.855]  It does not mean that we have to, you know, people, Christians have thought for so long we have to turn the other cheek.
[03:06:47.255 --> 03:06:50.777]  We just have to turn the other cheek and just accept this stuff.
[03:06:51.971 --> 03:06:54.694]  For what it is, because that's what... Tolerance.
[03:06:55.094 --> 03:06:56.976]  Apparently Christianity is about tolerance.
[03:06:57.076 --> 03:06:57.977]  Actually, it's not.
[03:06:59.538 --> 03:07:00.519]  Actually, it's not.
[03:07:01.961 --> 03:07:08.367]  And I'm speaking about the Christian perspective here because this was a direct attack on Christianity, this opening ceremony.
[03:07:08.407 --> 03:07:09.208]  That's clear.
[03:07:09.468 --> 03:07:11.090]  Even atheists can see it.
[03:07:13.252 --> 03:07:16.355]  Even the lowest IQ liberal can see it.
[03:07:20.950 --> 03:07:22.730]  This was an attack on Christianity.
[03:07:22.990 --> 03:07:29.692]  And so they tell you, they try to, and for years they've tried to make you think that tolerance is Christianity.
[03:07:29.792 --> 03:07:30.572]  No, it's not.
[03:07:31.372 --> 03:07:34.573]  In fact, we are not supposed to tolerate sin.
[03:07:34.613 --> 03:07:41.875]  And you know, I was watching Drew Hernandez livestream yesterday, and he made such a profound point.
[03:07:43.255 --> 03:07:46.416]  He made a profound point that where we are trying
[03:07:47.934 --> 03:08:02.844]  And I understand in the politics game that there is, you know, trying to get everyone on board because you will have a better country and you'll have a better state of affairs if you have a leader, a strong leader, that can actually bring people together.
[03:08:02.924 --> 03:08:03.864]  I understand that.
[03:08:05.345 --> 03:08:12.850]  But what these people, many of them, think, many politicians think, is that they can contain sin.
[03:08:13.211 --> 03:08:16.733]  That was the point that Drew made and it was such a powerful point because you can't.
[03:08:18.419 --> 03:08:25.363]  It starts with bake the cake to let me wave my genitals in front of your child's face.
[03:08:27.564 --> 03:08:31.326]  So no, I don't think that tolerance is the way forward.
[03:08:32.107 --> 03:08:34.528]  The way forward is morality.
[03:08:35.389 --> 03:08:44.334]  The way forward is the world rejecting this nonsense and setting the moral standard, God's moral standard.
[03:08:45.014 --> 03:08:47.215]  For the way that things need to be moving forward.
[03:08:47.635 --> 03:08:52.198]  No, MP, you can't change your gender after you're dead.
[03:08:52.218 --> 03:08:53.979]  No, we don't need those rights.
[03:08:54.559 --> 03:09:00.682]  That is actually degeneracy and you are not fit for office because you are a mental degenerate.
[03:09:02.063 --> 03:09:05.265]  Not because, oh, this is, you know, too woke.
[03:09:05.325 --> 03:09:05.985]  Forget that word.
[03:09:06.025 --> 03:09:07.586]  No, no, you are a degenerate.
[03:09:08.987 --> 03:09:12.169]  And so we need to reject degenerates.
[03:09:13.186 --> 03:09:20.856]  From public office, we need to reject degenerates from the public space, degenerate events, degeneracy in general.
[03:09:22.298 --> 03:09:27.846]  Because what is clear to me after the Olympics this week is that the world wants morality.
[03:09:30.759 --> 03:09:38.741]  Well, there has to be a line that gets crossed for the world to be up in arms and request morality again.
[03:09:38.761 --> 03:09:56.805]  And what I'm trying to say is, is that if you have a constant standard of morality, one that is a common sense approach, one that considers God in its decisions, then we will have a better world.
[03:09:59.036 --> 03:10:04.380]  So no, we're not going to tolerate acceptance and celebration of Satan, the defeated foe.
[03:10:04.601 --> 03:10:05.201]  No, we're not.
[03:10:05.822 --> 03:10:06.182]  We're not.
[03:10:06.702 --> 03:10:11.827]  And thank God for the widespread condemnation of this
[03:10:13.339 --> 03:10:14.620]  Satanic ceremony.
[03:10:15.520 --> 03:10:17.121]  Which, by the way, it's not the first one.
[03:10:17.421 --> 03:10:30.768]  You remember the last Olympics, how they were ushering in COVID, and you had the sick hospital, the hospital beds, and you had the sick kids, and they were telling you in advance at the last Olympics that they were about to launch a pandemic.
[03:10:30.808 --> 03:10:37.792]  This is ritualistic in nature because the people that are controlling this world are Satan worshippers.
[03:10:38.991 --> 03:10:40.912]  This is why you see these rituals.
[03:10:40.992 --> 03:10:55.337]  I mean, I'm preaching to the choir here, you all understand this, because you are regular viewers of one of the most important broadcasts in the world, and I mean InfoWars, that has been telling the world about this.
[03:10:55.357 --> 03:11:04.620]  You know, the world's just starting to realise, oh, it looks like we have some crazy devil worshippers in Parliament, or in power, or in the White House, or whatever.
[03:11:06.528 --> 03:11:09.972]  A lot of people just started to realise this during COVID.
[03:11:09.992 --> 03:11:10.613]  Here's the ritual.
[03:11:10.653 --> 03:11:13.436]  Here's the pandemic ritual at the last Olympics.
[03:11:13.456 --> 03:11:19.523]  Look at them, telling you that they're about to launch their depopulation agenda and kids are going to die.
[03:11:22.827 --> 03:11:31.591]  And so I don't condemn people for just waking up during COVID because I understand that a lot of this was hidden under a veil for the most part.
[03:11:32.751 --> 03:11:39.414]  The open evil and worship of evil was not as prominent as it is today.
[03:11:39.474 --> 03:11:40.215]  So I understand.
[03:11:40.255 --> 03:11:43.236]  I'm not condemning you if you woke up during COVID or even post COVID.
[03:11:43.296 --> 03:11:43.656]  Great!
[03:11:44.016 --> 03:11:47.618]  If you are still able to wake up today and realize your mistakes,
[03:11:49.155 --> 03:11:50.216]  Then that's fantastic.
[03:11:50.616 --> 03:11:52.358]  Or realize your misunderstandings about the world.
[03:11:52.378 --> 03:11:52.858]  That's great.
[03:11:54.720 --> 03:11:58.823]  But InfoWars has been here for decades telling people this.
[03:12:00.624 --> 03:12:05.989]  And so for everyone watching, I'm asking you to please continue supporting this important broadcast.
[03:12:06.049 --> 03:12:10.172]  Please continue supporting this important operation.
[03:12:10.212 --> 03:12:17.859]  This is so vital for our times because there are very few networks out there, even in conservative media, that will go this deep.
[03:12:18.965 --> 03:12:23.069]  As deep as InfoWars has over the past few years.
[03:12:25.070 --> 03:12:33.578]  Now I want to talk to everyone about the important, important things that Trump just said.
[03:12:34.519 --> 03:12:38.542]  We're living in a time where people aren't sure of who to trust, and I understand that.
[03:12:38.602 --> 03:12:43.486]  And I've been very, very open and honest with people from the start that
[03:12:44.287 --> 03:12:49.851]  I have ultimately always supported President Trump and believe that he will do the right thing.
[03:12:50.292 --> 03:12:53.134]  But where he's made mistakes, I've openly called it out.
[03:12:53.174 --> 03:12:55.375]  I think Alex has been very fair in that regard as well.
[03:12:55.416 --> 03:12:57.057]  And I think that that is important.
[03:12:57.437 --> 03:13:09.406]  When you love a leader or when you want a particular leader to do well, if you think this leader has the potential to do a good job, but they need some tweaking, that's actually caring for those leaders.
[03:13:09.466 --> 03:13:10.587]  We're not, you know,
[03:13:12.148 --> 03:13:13.329]  We're not in a cult here.
[03:13:13.369 --> 03:13:17.193]  We don't have a problem making suggestions for how people can improve.
[03:13:17.213 --> 03:13:19.435]  In fact, that's what you do for people that you care about.
[03:13:20.896 --> 03:13:25.660]  And so I am absolutely, at any time, willing to call out any candidate.
[03:13:25.720 --> 03:13:26.961]  I don't care who they are.
[03:13:27.842 --> 03:13:30.104]  And I've certainly done that where President Trump is concerned.
[03:13:30.124 --> 03:13:33.667]  I've probably criticized him more than any other candidate.
[03:13:34.288 --> 03:13:36.129]  Of course, you know, apart from Kamala.
[03:13:36.149 --> 03:13:37.630]  But my point is,
[03:13:38.732 --> 03:13:43.195]  That I've carefully assessed some of the words that this man is saying.
[03:13:44.416 --> 03:13:52.683]  And this video that Alex played yesterday, and I want to get the team to play it right now, Trump on banning meat and depopulation is so important.
[03:13:52.723 --> 03:13:55.525]  Take a listen to what he says, team, if you can pull that video up, please.
[03:13:57.106 --> 03:14:02.110]  Kamala even wants to pass laws to outlaw red meat to stop climate change.
[03:14:06.089 --> 03:14:06.829]  You know what that means?
[03:14:06.869 --> 03:14:08.250]  That means no more cows.
[03:14:08.290 --> 03:14:08.990]  This is serious.
[03:14:10.291 --> 03:14:11.832]  No, this means no more cows.
[03:14:11.892 --> 03:14:14.333]  I guess eventually she's gonna mean no more people, right?
[03:14:14.473 --> 03:14:15.073]  No more people.
[03:14:17.214 --> 03:14:21.076]  Please tell me, world, that you understand how important that statement was.
[03:14:23.017 --> 03:14:27.279]  Who else that is a presidential candidate
[03:14:28.553 --> 03:14:44.381]  Really anywhere in the world is telling you that there is a depopulation agenda, or telling you about the fact that they are trying to ban meat, or telling you about the fact that they want to take your vehicles, ban all vehicles except for electric.
[03:14:44.741 --> 03:14:47.682]  Who else is calling out the climate scam?
[03:14:47.722 --> 03:14:54.486]  Well, I know that Javier Mele did, but then he broke his election promise on day one, said that he was going to exit.
[03:14:55.166 --> 03:15:01.612]  Argentina out of the Paris Agreement and then sent a delegate during his inauguration to say, no, no, we're still fully on board.
[03:15:01.933 --> 03:15:03.534]  That is a betrayal of the country.
[03:15:03.594 --> 03:15:04.856]  So I will call that out.
[03:15:06.877 --> 03:15:07.997]  Now, I don't know.
[03:15:08.777 --> 03:15:11.838]  I'm still not 100% certain about him, but that was a problem.
[03:15:11.878 --> 03:15:21.000]  And so, if Trump is telling you that climate change is a scam, but then he doesn't take the correct actions once he's elected, that's something that needs to be called out.
[03:15:21.020 --> 03:15:27.521]  But this man is absolutely, at every single turn, calling out the agenda.
[03:15:27.541 --> 03:15:32.782]  And so I'm going to take you through a Smart City report that I've spoken about many, many times after the break.
[03:15:33.382 --> 03:15:41.609]  Take you through a few of those pages in contrast and look at what they want to achieve in contrast with what President Trump has said.
[03:15:43.731 --> 03:15:48.095]  And to me, these things are absolutely crucial because I've read their documents.
[03:15:48.436 --> 03:15:50.137]  I know what the UN wants to achieve.
[03:15:50.437 --> 03:15:57.624]  I know about the UN's AI World Society where they don't want you leaving your home and they want you to hug your mum through a hologram in your lounge room.
[03:16:00.154 --> 03:16:05.136]  And everything that Trump is saying is directly challenging their agenda.
[03:16:05.176 --> 03:16:08.557]  This is what I was warning about recently when it came to the European elections.
[03:16:09.518 --> 03:16:10.538]  We're almost out of time.
[03:16:10.618 --> 03:16:12.579]  I'll continue that point on the other side of the break.
[03:16:12.599 --> 03:16:13.359]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:16:13.679 --> 03:16:14.419]  We'll be right back.
[03:16:14.860 --> 03:16:18.681]  When we came out with Nitric Boost three years ago, it was a sleeper product.
[03:16:18.701 --> 03:16:19.401]  I didn't even promote it.
[03:16:19.581 --> 03:16:25.964]  But as listeners began to use it, it has become one of our top selling products because of the incredible results they get.
[03:16:26.564 --> 03:16:35.493]  If you want to give your cardiovascular system a leg up, if you want to go in and help clean out and purify your blood, ladies and gentlemen, Nitric Boost is the way to go.
[03:16:35.793 --> 03:16:38.716]  You've heard Dr. Judy Mikovits talk about how it's an amazing formula.
[03:16:39.016 --> 03:16:40.638]  This is what she's recommended to people.
[03:16:40.918 --> 03:16:43.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it does so many great things.
[03:16:44.221 --> 03:16:47.304]  Like, but you notice what happens in the morning if you're a man.
[03:16:47.324 --> 03:16:49.126]  I feel like I'm 16 years old again.
[03:16:49.466 --> 03:16:57.290]  When I was 16, I'd already had probably, I hate to brag, so I'm not bragging, it's actually shameful, probably 150 women or more, that's conservative.
[03:16:57.630 --> 03:17:00.591]  Nitric Boost is simply amazing, it's great for women as well.

[03:17:14.795 --> 03:17:16.617]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:17:16.677 --> 03:17:24.964]  I'm your guest host, Maria Zee of ZeeMedia.com, reporting to you live from the studio here today.
[03:17:24.984 --> 03:17:28.708]  It is an honour to be with you all today.
[03:17:29.769 --> 03:17:35.254]  Just before the break, I was talking about the things that Trump is saying in contrast to what the globalists want to achieve.
[03:17:35.274 --> 03:17:39.258]  Now, I have many, many times when I've been guest hosting and on
[03:17:39.858 --> 03:17:53.127]  Pretty much all of my own broadcasts and when people interview me brought up these two documents and the first one that I want to show you is the ARUP future of cities in a 1.5 degree world.
[03:17:53.187 --> 03:18:05.235]  I believe I've got that title right team if you can bring up page one of that ARUP report and everyone needs to familiarize themselves with this because what this is the future of urban consumption in a 1.5 degree world.
[03:18:05.275 --> 03:18:05.796]  Fantastic.
[03:18:05.836 --> 03:18:06.496]  C40 cities.
[03:18:06.576 --> 03:18:06.977]  Okay so
[03:18:07.717 --> 03:18:32.959]  What this report is, I'm going to tell you about it just in case you're not aware, is this is in conjunction with C40 Cities, which is setting up smart cities all around the world, and you can go onto their website and have a look at whether your city is currently listed as a smart city, or you can go to the Global Covenant of Mayors website and actually look at whether your mayor is part of this covenant
[03:18:34.275 --> 03:18:38.578]  Very religious term that they've formed this global covenant.
[03:18:39.558 --> 03:18:52.767]  Whether your mayor is part of this covenant of mayors, or this global covenant I should say, of mayors that have subscribed to this lunacy that's contained within the AARUP report.
[03:18:53.327 --> 03:18:54.828]  And this report basically is
[03:18:56.409 --> 03:19:08.720]  And if you look at my previous reporting on this, you can see how they're actually incentivising these mayors to achieve not just the progressive targets, but the ambitious targets for 2030.
[03:19:09.221 --> 03:19:21.471]  And so what you have is someone like Mayor Adams or Sadiq Khan in London, Mayor Adams of New York, who've just gone straight to the ambitious target, which I said when I first discovered this report was what was going to happen, because I knew
[03:19:22.392 --> 03:19:32.055]  They're not just going to go for the progressive target, they're going to go for the full lunacy because they're incentivised to do so.
[03:19:32.395 --> 03:19:42.698]  And so you have Sadiq Khan talking about, no, you can only buy three items of clothing, you can't eat meat, restricted travel, all of these sorts of things.
[03:19:42.898 --> 03:19:47.680]  And Mayor Adams in New York has done the same thing where he said, oh, we're working with American Express.
[03:19:49.158 --> 03:19:52.661]  To be able to limit the amount of meat that people in New York are purchasing.
[03:19:53.642 --> 03:19:58.245]  So what it is, is they're trying to destroy your confidence in your government.
[03:19:58.265 --> 03:20:12.436]  They're trying to make you hate your government, which by the way, has been achieved for the most part because they don't want you to actually like your government because they want a one world leader and then the councils underneath that managing all the districts.
[03:20:12.836 --> 03:20:14.498]  And yes, they do call them districts.
[03:20:16.104 --> 03:20:17.864]  That is how they want to manage this.
[03:20:18.805 --> 03:20:20.685]  And the rest is going to be AI.
[03:20:21.425 --> 03:20:22.266]  AI government.
[03:20:22.606 --> 03:20:27.827]  And so Yuval Noah Harari has said that 2024 will be the last year of elections.
[03:20:28.547 --> 03:20:37.130]  And so they will do everything in their power to make sure that their leaders aren't, that sorry, that leaders that are against them are not elected
[03:20:38.131 --> 03:20:41.338]  In this last year, the day plan of elections.
[03:20:41.379 --> 03:20:42.822]  This is what the WEF says.
[03:20:42.842 --> 03:20:46.411]  Or Yuval from the lead advisor to Schwab.
[03:20:47.723 --> 03:20:49.445]  2024 is going to be the last year of elections.
[03:20:49.565 --> 03:20:51.647]  In future, AI will decide for us.
[03:20:52.047 --> 03:20:55.410]  And AI is going to tell you if you're gay or not, because you don't know.
[03:20:55.430 --> 03:20:58.973]  And AI is going to tell you what political leaders you want.
[03:20:59.054 --> 03:21:07.942]  And AI is going to tell you, through sensors all inside your body with the nanorobots, what 3D printed vitamins you need this morning.
[03:21:10.632 --> 03:21:37.220]  The vision that they have painted for the future, and they all say it, by the way, Kurzweil, Harari, they all talk about how they are going to have us swimming with nanorobots, cyborgize us into human 2.0, and then we're just going to be useless, and then the UN, through their remaking the world towards an age of global enlightenment, their AI world society, their new social contract, which I spoke about just a couple of weeks ago on this broadcast,
[03:21:37.680 --> 03:21:41.704]  Sable, but basically after we've done all of this, you're going to be a one world citizen.
[03:21:41.724 --> 03:21:43.385]  You're not going to have an individual identity.
[03:21:43.666 --> 03:21:46.428]  You're going to mine cryptocurrency with your body data.
[03:21:46.488 --> 03:21:47.309]  Bill Gates patent 060606.
[03:21:47.349 --> 03:21:47.910]  Look it up.
[03:21:50.549 --> 03:21:58.594]  And the only way that you're going to be able to earn this central bank digital currency with your body data is, look, it's not a social credit system.
[03:21:58.634 --> 03:22:00.876]  We're not punishing you for doing the wrong thing.
[03:22:00.896 --> 03:22:08.141]  We're just not going to pay you your digital currency if you don't behave in line with how we want you to behave.
[03:22:08.161 --> 03:22:14.145]  If your behavior is not conducive to our goals, which are to make everyone gay, I guess.
[03:22:17.921 --> 03:22:19.062]  No one to reproduce.
[03:22:19.082 --> 03:22:20.503]  We don't want people reproducing.
[03:22:20.543 --> 03:22:21.563]  We don't want people happy.
[03:22:21.603 --> 03:22:22.724]  We don't want them prospering.
[03:22:22.944 --> 03:22:37.373]  We want them confined to their homes, visiting their loved ones through a hologram in their lounge room, swimming with nanorobots that Rand Corporation says can control your body, coerce you into doing things that you wouldn't normally do because it now has the ability to manipulate your behaviour and your brain.
[03:22:39.074 --> 03:22:40.395]  That's what we want for humanity.
[03:22:40.415 --> 03:22:47.239]  And Yuval says that after we're done with them, because they'll be so useless, we'll just drug them and give them video games.
[03:22:49.465 --> 03:22:50.606]  That sounds great!
[03:22:52.547 --> 03:22:58.732]  And that is the direction that the world is heading in if we don't see a change in this upcoming election.
[03:22:58.752 --> 03:23:05.157]  And I will give you my reasons for what I've seen from what Donald Trump is saying in contrast to what these maniacs are saying.
[03:23:05.177 --> 03:23:08.599]  So team, if you can bring up please from that ARAP report, page 39.
[03:23:08.820 --> 03:23:10.721]  The page is food.
[03:23:12.938 --> 03:23:18.489]  Okay, so it says that food contributes 13% of total emissions in C40 cities.
[03:23:18.950 --> 03:23:21.395]  If you can go to the next page, team, page 40.
[03:23:22.867 --> 03:23:27.168]  You can see there, everyone, that they want dietary changes.
[03:23:27.208 --> 03:23:27.988]  Look at that table.
[03:23:28.708 --> 03:23:30.108]  They want dietary changes.
[03:23:30.809 --> 03:23:40.491]  And the progressive target, and this is what I was explaining to you before about Mayor Adams and Sadiq Khan, they said the progressive target for 2030 is 16 kilograms of meat per person per year.
[03:23:41.191 --> 03:23:43.611]  But what did Mayor Adams and Sadiq Khan do?
[03:23:43.651 --> 03:23:47.212]  They went straight to the ambitious target, which is what I said would happen.
[03:23:48.371 --> 03:23:50.652]  Zero kilograms of meat consumption.
[03:23:51.252 --> 03:23:57.514]  Then they want zero kilograms of dairy consumption per person, per year.
[03:23:57.554 --> 03:24:00.795]  So they don't want you to have any meat, any dairy.
[03:24:00.835 --> 03:24:04.656]  Tim, can you please play that clip again of Trump on banning meat?
[03:24:09.498 --> 03:24:14.500]  Kamala even wants to pass laws to outlaw red meat to stop climate change.
[03:24:18.496 --> 03:24:19.236]  You know what that means?
[03:24:19.276 --> 03:24:20.356]  That means no more cows.
[03:24:20.376 --> 03:24:21.397]  You know, this is serious.
[03:24:22.697 --> 03:24:24.237]  No, this means no more cows.
[03:24:24.297 --> 03:24:26.717]  I guess eventually she's gonna mean no more people, right?
[03:24:26.877 --> 03:24:27.478]  No more people.
[03:24:29.298 --> 03:24:37.219]  So let me tell you that when someone calls this out, whoever they are, they know what's going on.
[03:24:38.599 --> 03:24:46.821]  Or at least they have some sort of an idea that, hmm, banning our food supply probably isn't the smartest thing right now or ever.
[03:24:47.947 --> 03:24:51.608]  Something that humans have been eating, consuming, something that's fantastic for you.
[03:24:51.648 --> 03:24:56.850]  In fact, recent studies have shown that consuming red meat is actually really good for you.
[03:24:56.910 --> 03:24:58.411]  It doesn't cause heart problems.
[03:24:59.211 --> 03:25:04.833]  And who would have known that something that God gave us for our consumption was actually good for us?
[03:25:04.973 --> 03:25:05.433]  Wow.
[03:25:05.594 --> 03:25:06.114]  Amazing.
[03:25:06.394 --> 03:25:12.636]  When he told the Israelites that they were going to the land of milk and honey, that that probably means that milk might be good for humans.
[03:25:12.896 --> 03:25:14.297]  But no, we want to ban it now.
[03:25:15.441 --> 03:25:16.421]  And what did Trump say?
[03:25:16.541 --> 03:25:21.744]  He said that this, the next step, and he said it kind of in jest, but I don't think it was in jest.
[03:25:22.224 --> 03:25:23.524]  The next step is to what?
[03:25:24.004 --> 03:25:24.685]  Depopulate?
[03:25:25.745 --> 03:25:27.646]  Well, yes, actually, that is their next step.
[03:25:29.947 --> 03:25:37.490]  Tim, if you can go to page 41 of that report, the next section is clothing and textiles.
[03:25:38.877 --> 03:25:41.401]  You can see that fake meat there on the screen.
[03:25:41.982 --> 03:25:51.175]  For clothing and textiles they say that this contributes 4% of total emissions in C40 cities and the next page they tell you that you will only be able to buy
[03:25:53.223 --> 03:25:56.087]  Three items of clothing per person per year.
[03:25:56.107 --> 03:26:01.073]  Remember, ignore the progressive target, everyone, because they haven't even bothered to try and soften the blow.
[03:26:01.093 --> 03:26:03.976]  They haven't even bothered to ease you into this.
[03:26:04.176 --> 03:26:10.364]  They've gone straight to the ambitious target, which is three items of clothing per person per year.
[03:26:10.604 --> 03:26:12.346]  Do you know when I talk to sleepy women?
[03:26:13.257 --> 03:26:18.160]  Women who don't really understand the agenda and I tell them this, this is the part that upsets them the most.
[03:26:18.560 --> 03:26:26.604]  So if you need talking points guys, for liberal women, probably that one is the one that's going to upset them more than anything.
[03:26:27.424 --> 03:26:32.967]  Because they do plan on putting limits on how many clothing items you can buy.
[03:26:33.147 --> 03:26:36.649]  Go to page 43 for me team, private transport.
[03:26:38.707 --> 03:26:43.530]  And this is where they say that this contributes 8% of the world's total emissions.
[03:26:43.570 --> 03:26:52.455]  And if you go to the next page, it shows you on page 85 that the goal is to have you owning zero private vehicles.
[03:26:53.533 --> 03:26:55.994]  Zero private vehicles.
[03:26:56.034 --> 03:27:06.138]  And the way that they are trying to achieve this, everyone, is by forcing everyone to go electric, at the same time simultaneously shutting down coal power plants, not drilling.
[03:27:06.938 --> 03:27:09.159]  They want to go to green energy.
[03:27:09.179 --> 03:27:22.844]  And Tucker Carlson was recently in Australia talking about how the reason that Australia's energy costs are so high, despite the fact that we have abundant resources and ability to produce our own energy, is because we are
[03:27:23.817 --> 03:27:30.482]  Selling our coal off to China, selling our resources off to China, and then buying back green energy.
[03:27:30.502 --> 03:27:32.864]  And he said that enough.
[03:27:33.564 --> 03:27:37.247]  That alone is enough to get these people out of power.
[03:27:37.267 --> 03:27:38.248]  This is criminal.
[03:27:39.417 --> 03:27:41.539]  We have the resources on our land.
[03:27:42.339 --> 03:27:44.001]  We're not global citizens.
[03:27:44.081 --> 03:27:48.304]  No matter how much they want to make us global citizens, we're not global citizens.
[03:27:48.904 --> 03:27:50.786]  Our identity has not been destroyed.
[03:27:50.846 --> 03:28:04.537]  In fact, it has backfired on them completely that they keep trying to erase patriotism, to erase everything that makes a country great, because the people are becoming more patriotic as they double down.
[03:28:09.198 --> 03:28:17.281]  And so, going back to my point on the energy, Trump says, drill, baby, drill.
[03:28:18.081 --> 03:28:22.522]  And he says he's not going to ban gas vehicles.
[03:28:22.622 --> 03:28:30.645]  Well, let me tell you that that is in direct opposition to what the globalists are trying to achieve.
[03:28:31.704 --> 03:28:38.387]  That statement alone of the fact that he will not ban gas vehicles is in direct opposition.
[03:28:38.407 --> 03:28:41.809]  Because bring it up again, guys, if you don't mind, page 85.
[03:28:42.209 --> 03:28:46.851]  It clearly says zero private vehicle ownership is the goal.
[03:28:47.891 --> 03:28:49.432]  Zero private vehicle ownership.
[03:28:49.472 --> 03:28:55.395]  So when someone comes and says, I am not going to ban gas vehicles.
[03:28:57.836 --> 03:29:00.337]  Because what they're doing is they're forcing everyone into electric.
[03:29:01.664 --> 03:29:10.610]  And at the same time destroying the power grid so that you won't have the energy required to power your electric vehicle because they want zero private vehicles.
[03:29:11.551 --> 03:29:13.532]  Eventually, they don't want you travelling at all.
[03:29:13.873 --> 03:29:21.638]  So when someone comes along and says, no, no, we're not going to do that, that is a direct, that is indirect opposition to their stated goals.
[03:29:24.560 --> 03:29:25.100]  On page 88,
[03:29:27.628 --> 03:29:32.032]  As far as the aviation industry goes, they say that this contributes 2% of total emissions.
[03:29:33.053 --> 03:29:38.558]  And because of that 2%, which by the way, CO2 is the gas of life.
[03:29:38.578 --> 03:29:42.662]  This is the part that's so frustrating, is that this is actually helpful.
[03:29:42.922 --> 03:29:45.884]  The world is greening, we need CO2.
[03:29:47.105 --> 03:29:51.249]  So all of this, we need to reduce emissions, actually means reducing life.
[03:29:51.850 --> 03:29:52.851]  Let's be clear on that.
[03:29:54.758 --> 03:30:00.722]  And when Donald Trump says this is a complete scam, this is such a huge statement.
[03:30:01.842 --> 03:30:22.775]  Any leader that says this is a complete scam, my only concern about some of these leaders, like I've highlighted about the so-called right-wing movement in France when Marine Le Pen's party was getting a lot of attention, Jordan Bardella had a look at some of his previous quotes and he's saying, human-induced climate change, we need to base our economic model on this and so on and so forth.
[03:30:22.795 --> 03:30:23.676]  It's like, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:30:24.619 --> 03:30:29.422]  There is no such thing as climate change in the way that they say it.
[03:30:29.542 --> 03:30:33.165]  It is called changing weather and a result of geoengineering.
[03:30:33.405 --> 03:30:36.387]  They keep gaslighting us and telling us the world's getting hotter.
[03:30:36.707 --> 03:30:43.491]  I can assure you that Australia's never been as cold as it has been for the past two years, even though they keep manipulating the temperatures.
[03:30:43.751 --> 03:30:45.493]  I'm sure that's the case in many other places.
[03:30:45.573 --> 03:30:48.635]  It's definitely not hotter than it used to be.
[03:30:48.675 --> 03:30:50.376]  That's just a fact.
[03:30:51.320 --> 03:30:56.124]  And, you know, many people have gone out and shown that they manipulate these temperatures and so on and so forth.
[03:30:56.144 --> 03:31:00.507]  But anyway, my point is, climate change is a hoax.
[03:31:01.227 --> 03:31:06.091]  However, it is the main driver for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
[03:31:06.131 --> 03:31:09.553]  In fact, if you look on their website, look this up, UN75.
[03:31:09.914 --> 03:31:12.656]  Team, you don't have to, I'm just directing the audience.
[03:31:12.776 --> 03:31:15.718]  UN75, an unexpected message from the future.
[03:31:16.178 --> 03:31:38.849]  Go and read the first few paragraphs there where Vinton Cerf, the evangelist of the internet, says he was playing around with some frequencies and he got a message from some demon in the future, I guess, telling him that it was 2020 that humans realized we have a window of opportunity to go really hard with the sustainable development goals so that we can make it to 2045, which is their ultimate dystopia year.
[03:31:40.490 --> 03:31:49.772]  And so, as per their book, Remaking the World Towards an Age of Global Enlightenment and the UN100, you can go and watch my series on that, please.
[03:31:50.212 --> 03:31:52.172]  Here it is, the team's got it up, good on you guys.
[03:31:53.812 --> 03:31:55.213]  It's ridiculous when you read this.
[03:31:55.313 --> 03:32:08.835]  Like, it literally says on the United Nations website, I was talking to some unknown entity from the future, from the year 2045, and they told me that we just have to go really hard with the Sustainable Development Goals in order to make it to this point.
[03:32:09.315 --> 03:32:09.835]  Absolutely.
[03:32:10.035 --> 03:32:12.957]  When I tell people this and they look it up for themselves, they can't believe their eyes.
[03:32:13.437 --> 03:32:15.198]  This is because the United Nations is a cult.
[03:32:15.459 --> 03:32:16.499]  It's a satanic cult.
[03:32:18.120 --> 03:32:27.946]  And the people in control are in a satanic cult that are trying to usher in the mark of the beast, that are trying to usher in a system where you can't buy or sell without this mark.
[03:32:28.820 --> 03:32:29.300]  Here you go.
[03:32:29.940 --> 03:32:30.301]  Look at this.
[03:32:31.081 --> 03:32:31.641]  We'll read it out.
[03:32:31.681 --> 03:32:32.361]  It's that ridiculous.
[03:32:32.421 --> 03:32:37.203]  I was recently experimenting with some extremely high frequency receivers in the 125 GHz band when I detected an unexpected but strong and repeated signal.
[03:32:48.388 --> 03:32:55.273]  I recorded it and after a considerable effort using sophisticated machine learning tools, I was able to decode the signal.
[03:32:55.913 --> 03:33:05.079]  The message appears to have come from the future by a means unknown and reads something along the lines of, to those of you who are successfully reading this, well done, that means you made it.
[03:33:05.199 --> 03:33:08.521]  It was 2020 that humanity realized that we have to
[03:33:10.503 --> 03:33:13.545]  Look at those last three lines of that paragraph.
[03:33:13.945 --> 03:33:26.393]  It was in 2020 that it was finally recognised that our only hope was to focus intensely and resolutely on the development of new technologies to cope with the crisis of global warming and its side effects.
[03:33:26.433 --> 03:33:31.136]  So a leader that's telling you that this is a scam and then sticks by that?
[03:33:32.117 --> 03:33:41.823]  Is in direct opposition to the central focus of their agenda because the reasons for banning you from going out of your home is climate change.
[03:33:42.063 --> 03:33:45.185]  The reasons for perpetually injecting you is climate change.
[03:33:45.425 --> 03:33:48.667]  I've discussed this before in Australia's pandemic preparedness plan.
[03:33:48.687 --> 03:33:55.671]  It says we need to preemptively inject people, I don't know, forever because we're going to prevent climate change that way.
[03:33:56.804 --> 03:34:03.328]  We're going to prevent pandemics because climate change is causing pandemics and they're changing every time someone, I don't know, breathes outside.
[03:34:03.608 --> 03:34:12.333]  And so we have to consider preventative injections, preemptive injections, and legalising gain-of-function research as well, by the way.
[03:34:12.373 --> 03:34:13.693]  That's what that document calls for.
[03:34:14.033 --> 03:34:17.956]  And you just have New Zealand that's just published their pandemic plan.
[03:34:18.036 --> 03:34:21.958]  Please go and watch last week's broadcast that I did with Dr Reema Labo on this subject.
[03:34:23.427 --> 03:34:42.434]  Talking about the fact that they now, you know, they want to force inject people based on this scam and they're telling us the bird flu and think about the significance of President Donald Trump saying the whole business about banning meat at a time where they're telling you meat's not safe because of the bird flu.
[03:34:42.514 --> 03:34:43.355]  Think about that.
[03:34:44.235 --> 03:34:48.997]  At a time where they're trying to ramp up a potential pandemic ahead of this election so that it doesn't go ahead.
[03:34:50.253 --> 03:35:02.755]  Trying to fearmonger everyone into not eating meat and being afraid of some fake nonsense that they've created again through a fake PCR test that can't tell the difference between an orange and COVID.
[03:35:04.575 --> 03:35:08.976]  If you PCR test a mandarin, it'll turn up positive for goodness sake.
[03:35:09.556 --> 03:35:14.177]  Because it's not a diagnostic tool and Carey Mullis, right before they killed him, told us that.
[03:35:16.798 --> 03:35:18.758]  Think about the significance of
[03:35:20.492 --> 03:35:27.197]  A running presidential candidate saying that at a time when they're trying to launch this and New Zealand's preparing for it.
[03:35:27.237 --> 03:35:39.948]  Apparently, I mean, they're publishing, hey, we're giving medical officers and police officers the authority to use force to inject people and come after those that don't comply.
[03:35:39.968 --> 03:35:44.451]  That was just published this month, this July.
[03:35:47.434 --> 03:35:49.936]  And the WHO, the pandemic treaty,
[03:35:52.477 --> 03:35:53.899]  Negotiations have resumed.
[03:35:54.099 --> 03:35:56.240]  I just interviewed James Roguski on that subject.
[03:35:56.300 --> 03:35:57.441]  It's up on zmedia.com.
[03:35:57.461 --> 03:35:58.122]  Go and check it out.
[03:35:58.602 --> 03:36:00.063]  We'll have it up on band soon as well.
[03:36:02.625 --> 03:36:07.909]  So they are going full steam ahead with this climate agenda, which is at the central point.
[03:36:08.229 --> 03:36:09.950]  They're linking everything to climate, guys.
[03:36:10.491 --> 03:36:13.573]  The earth worship, the fact that religions need to come together.
[03:36:13.613 --> 03:36:17.396]  Remember when they declared a new ten commandments that were centered around the climate?
[03:36:19.497 --> 03:36:27.243]  We need to preserve the Earth for future generations, but just keep injecting yourself with sterilizing injections so you can never be fertile again.
[03:36:27.283 --> 03:36:29.405]  But we've got to preserve Mother Earth.
[03:36:30.526 --> 03:36:31.066]  Okay?
[03:36:31.807 --> 03:36:32.547]  For who?
[03:36:34.008 --> 03:36:35.930]  For who when you're sterilizing us all?
[03:36:37.651 --> 03:36:40.173]  When you're spraying toxins in the air every single day?
[03:36:40.894 --> 03:36:44.577]  When you want to give us fake meat that's grown from cancer cells?
[03:36:47.259 --> 03:36:48.460]  Who are you preserving it for?
[03:36:49.923 --> 03:36:50.303]  For them.
[03:36:51.905 --> 03:37:01.932]  For the satanic cult that plans to use us to, I don't know, do what?
[03:37:02.272 --> 03:37:03.773]  Cheap labor in the metaverse?
[03:37:03.794 --> 03:37:07.736]  They want us to work and expand the digital world for them to rule over?
[03:37:08.257 --> 03:37:09.958]  Because they can never be real gods?
[03:37:11.760 --> 03:37:12.760]  You'll never be a god.
[03:37:12.840 --> 03:37:14.261]  The people that think that they're gods.
[03:37:14.301 --> 03:37:15.222]  You are so pathetic.
[03:37:15.262 --> 03:37:15.983]  You are so weak.
[03:37:18.035 --> 03:37:25.500]  And your defeated God that you worship was just condemned by the world at the Olympics.
[03:37:28.423 --> 03:37:39.771]  So humanity, we have a serious chance now that people all over the world are rejecting this evil, rejecting this satanism, rejecting this degeneracy.
[03:37:39.871 --> 03:37:46.736]  No, we don't want men waving their genitals in our children's faces anymore, thank you very much.
[03:37:48.672 --> 03:37:56.418]  And in Australia, and I've spoken about this before, because I knew it would come to my country, I know that Australia is affected by what happens in the United States.
[03:37:57.559 --> 03:38:01.822]  And I saw Drag Queen Storytime is coming and people said, you're importing a culture war.
[03:38:02.182 --> 03:38:02.623]  Am I?
[03:38:03.483 --> 03:38:03.904]  Really?
[03:38:04.664 --> 03:38:10.168]  Maybe I just understand these freaks a little bit better than some give me credit for.
[03:38:10.188 --> 03:38:14.492]  I don't know everything, but I've studied these maniacs for years.
[03:38:16.127 --> 03:38:29.736]  And lo and behold, a few months later, we had a locked door event in our Parliament with Daniel Andrews because there was so much rejection of drag queen storytime, pedophile storytime everywhere.
[03:38:29.756 --> 03:38:34.279]  So then they went and they held it in Parliament behind locked doors.
[03:38:34.620 --> 03:38:43.025]  Children with men sexually dancing in front of them inside our Parliament building.
[03:38:43.065 --> 03:38:43.766]  These people
[03:38:46.226 --> 03:38:53.510]  These people need to be rejected by all of society, and that is happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:38:53.870 --> 03:38:55.171]  That happened this week.
[03:38:55.431 --> 03:39:01.954]  Humanity had a huge win when humanity said, no thanks, we don't want Satan, we're fine.
[03:39:02.454 --> 03:39:02.954]  And you know what?
[03:39:02.994 --> 03:39:08.097]  This is really disrespectful to the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and so let's not do that anymore.
[03:39:09.798 --> 03:39:10.958]  Well done, humanity.
[03:39:11.379 --> 03:39:11.759]  Well done.
[03:39:13.311 --> 03:39:27.792]  When I hear President Trump talking about the fact that he's going to cut funding to schools that impose vaccine mandates and mask mandates, that is in direct opposition to their agenda, which is a forever injection agenda, by the way.
[03:39:28.633 --> 03:39:36.800]  I'm talking 500 new vaccines by 2030 published by the World Health Organization in their Immunization Agenda 2030 documents.
[03:39:36.840 --> 03:39:37.140]  Look it up.
[03:39:37.721 --> 03:39:42.805]  Look up Immunization Agenda 2030 and just Ctrl-F and look for the number 500.
[03:39:43.366 --> 03:39:43.846]  You'll find it.
[03:39:43.886 --> 03:39:45.948]  They want to introduce 500 new injections.
[03:39:47.264 --> 03:39:49.726]  We don't want this transgender lunacy in schools.
[03:39:50.947 --> 03:39:55.831]  And I know that people have been critical of President Trump on the vaccine thing, so have I, obviously.
[03:39:56.191 --> 03:39:58.173]  But there are glimmers of hope starting to show.
[03:39:58.213 --> 03:40:00.175]  He's saying that he wants to investigate Big Pharma.
[03:40:00.215 --> 03:40:04.518]  We all saw that leaked audio of that recent call with RFK Jr.
[03:40:04.859 --> 03:40:08.081]  Now, was he talking about just injections for babies only?
[03:40:08.121 --> 03:40:09.743]  Well, Alex spoke about that recently.
[03:40:09.783 --> 03:40:13.346]  The way that Trump's brain works, he knows better than many.
[03:40:14.895 --> 03:40:18.362]  He said that he's going to do investigations into Big Pharma.
[03:40:19.525 --> 03:40:22.471]  And should he backflip, I do believe
[03:40:23.838 --> 03:40:33.124]  That the whole world would hold him accountable, but to backflip on this many anti-establishment, anti-globalist issues, I can't see it.
[03:40:33.264 --> 03:40:34.605]  I cannot see it.
[03:40:35.285 --> 03:40:44.211]  Guys, if you can quickly, before we finish, bring up how Meta AI, bring that screenshot up of how Meta AI is denying that the assassination attempt happened.
[03:40:44.231 --> 03:40:46.933]  It's a fictional event, Meta AI says.
[03:40:47.293 --> 03:40:49.815]  And when you Google, there it is, look at that.
[03:40:50.535 --> 03:40:59.540]  The reason for the disparity in information about the Trump assassination attempt is because it's a fictional event.
[03:41:00.440 --> 03:41:05.163]  Whereas Kamala Harris's 2024 presidential campaign is a real and ongoing event.
[03:41:05.323 --> 03:41:08.584]  Ladies and gentlemen, they are trying to erase this from history.
[03:41:08.604 --> 03:41:15.388]  And you can see when you Google, if you can bring that picture up quickly, guys, Google search Trump assassination attempt.
[03:41:16.963 --> 03:41:17.563]  It doesn't come up.
[03:41:18.324 --> 03:41:18.984]  It doesn't come up.
[03:41:19.244 --> 03:41:26.729]  They don't want this man in office, and they are going to go to extreme lengths to interfere with this upcoming election.
[03:41:26.769 --> 03:41:33.814]  But I'm going to be here for the next few months fighting for the entire West, and I hope that you will be here with me.
[03:41:33.854 --> 03:41:36.736]  God bless you, and I'll see you all very soon.
[03:41:37.176 --> 03:41:42.920]  So number one, you've got central banks now starting to buy it by the tons, right?
[03:41:43.040 --> 03:41:43.520]  It's a lot.
[03:41:44.292 --> 03:41:50.919]  You've now got Chinese citizens being encouraged to not just buy gold, but buy silver.
[03:41:51.620 --> 03:41:56.625]  Because China and Russia want to destroy the Western banks.
[03:41:57.146 --> 03:42:05.295]  And the Western banks, JPMorgan Chase and HSBC, have the largest number of naked short positions on the planet.
[03:42:06.141 --> 03:42:06.761]  On the planet.
[03:42:06.801 --> 03:42:13.924]  I think between the two of them, they have over 900 million ounces of silver in short position.
[03:42:13.964 --> 03:42:17.505]  Well, only 1.2 billion ounces of silver is mined every year globally.
[03:42:17.545 --> 03:42:21.627]  So they've got almost the entire annual production in a short position.
[03:42:22.187 --> 03:42:28.429]  That means when the price goes up, these banks lose money hand over fist in multiples.
[03:42:29.009 --> 03:42:38.357]  China knows this, which is why they're encouraging all of their citizens now to buy not just gold, but buy silver, because that creates more demand.
[03:42:38.717 --> 03:42:45.363]  Every time silver goes up in price, the Western banks lose money in multiples, because they're on the wrong side of the transaction.
[03:42:46.098 --> 03:42:50.080]  They want to do it to destroy the West and they want to do it to make a financial gain.
[03:42:50.540 --> 03:42:55.322]  Both of those in their minds are legitimate enough reasons to do something right.
[03:42:55.362 --> 03:43:01.645]  But let's look at silver because that's what we're allocated into right now because the ratio between gold and silver points towards silver.
[03:43:01.705 --> 03:43:02.505]  It's outperforming.
[03:43:03.306 --> 03:43:05.608]  Where were we just four years ago?
[03:43:06.708 --> 03:43:05.608]  1191.
[03:43:08.009 --> 03:43:15.354]  But now, since then, we've gone from 1191 to almost 30 in the last four years.
[03:43:15.775 --> 03:43:21.779]  See, the trend is accelerating because the geopolitical dynamics are causing its growth.
[03:43:22.139 --> 03:43:23.900]  It's not just a flight for safety.
[03:43:24.301 --> 03:43:29.024]  It's not just a way to preserve and protect your freedoms and get out of
[03:43:29.702 --> 03:43:39.384]  These unified ledgers and these social credit scoring systems and this digital money, you're getting something tangible that actually doesn't just grow.
[03:43:39.424 --> 03:43:40.345]  It's growing tremendously.
[03:43:40.365 --> 03:43:41.845]  It's up like 40% in four months.
[03:43:41.865 --> 03:43:42.605]  That's amazing.
[03:43:43.065 --> 03:43:46.126]  But you also have something that can maintain your freedoms, Alex.
[03:43:46.186 --> 03:43:55.108]  That's the tangible intangible, which is as our freedom... Oh no, I can't believe we have millions of viewers right now and maybe 500 people call you.
[03:43:55.608 --> 03:43:56.348]  It's a sponsor.
[03:43:56.368 --> 03:43:57.989]  I want to promote what I think is great.
[03:43:58.789 --> 03:44:05.350]  So, I sell water filtration systems that have the highest rating for like half the price on average, and I sell high quality supplements.
[03:44:05.450 --> 03:44:06.810]  I just sell stuff that I think is great.
[03:44:07.371 --> 03:44:10.431]  Everybody should call you and get into silver and gold right now.
[03:44:10.811 --> 03:44:12.632]  There's nothing performing as good as it.
[03:44:13.152 --> 03:44:18.013]  I mean, it's like, it's like, it's on record it's the best investment, but the stockbrokers won't tell you that.
[03:44:18.213 --> 03:44:21.773]  The globalist argument is, oh, the world's in turmoil, and everything's collapsing.
[03:44:21.793 --> 03:44:26.014]  We got to be strong, and America's got to threaten Russia and China to keep us as the dollar.
[03:44:26.334 --> 03:44:28.337]  But they're the ones that undermine the currency.
[03:44:28.377 --> 03:44:31.021]  They're the ones that brought us into this situation.
[03:44:31.762 --> 03:44:33.745]  And so that's why this is so incredibly dangerous.
[03:44:33.765 --> 03:44:37.290]  This is trying to kill Trump just, what, 10, 11 days ago.
[03:44:37.691 --> 03:44:39.854]  They are going for broke.
[03:44:39.954 --> 03:44:41.256]  I wish we weren't in this position.
[03:44:41.736 --> 03:44:42.236]  But we are.
[03:44:42.336 --> 03:44:48.117]  But by admitting where we are, we have a real chance of waking up, like Congress saying, we know you tried to kill Trump.
[03:44:48.437 --> 03:44:50.858]  Buying silver is the smartest bet there is.
[03:44:50.878 --> 03:44:53.658]  If you'd have bought silver a year ago, up 20-30%.
[03:44:53.979 --> 03:44:56.059]  That's what you want.
[03:44:56.179 --> 03:44:59.160]  And silver is the big mover in this economy.
[03:44:59.480 --> 03:45:03.340]  So, go now to KEPM.com forward slash gold, or 720-605-3000.
[03:45:03.380 --> 03:45:05.361]  We'll explain it all to you.
[03:45:05.781 --> 03:45:09.882]  Most of the gold and silver companies are charging you huge 30, 40, 50% premiums
[03:45:11.822 --> 03:45:13.804]  And most of the conservative talk show hosts are doing it too.
[03:45:14.104 --> 03:45:16.066]  And I talked to a person, I said, you need Kirk Elliott.
[03:45:16.466 --> 03:45:19.949]  What does Goldman Sachs think gold is going to do before the end of the year?
[03:45:19.969 --> 03:45:21.670]  $2,700 an ounce.
[03:45:21.951 --> 03:45:28.516]  And I'm sitting here saying, it funds us, it keeps us on air, and it's the best investment hands down in an imperfect world.
[03:45:28.556 --> 03:45:33.660]  I mean, this is, to me, is one of the most important things to protect your financial future ever.
[03:45:33.840 --> 03:45:36.723]  Go now to KEPM.com forward slash gold.
