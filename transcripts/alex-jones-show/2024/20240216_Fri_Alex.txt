[00:00:15.672 --> 00:00:30.672]  [Music]
[00:00:30.672 --> 00:00:32.671]  It's Friday, February 6th.
[00:00:32.483 --> 00:00:38.446]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and the wheels are coming off the New World Order.
[00:00:39.387 --> 00:00:42.288]  Their entire system is being revealed to the world.
[00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:50.733]  There are open announcements by publications like the Wall Street Journal that, hey, inflation is your fault and you should just skip meals.
[00:00:51.253 --> 00:00:54.395]  We're gonna be breaking that down next segment and so much more today.
[00:00:55.558 --> 00:01:03.761]  But the first thing I wanted to get into is Fannie Willis and the incredible testimony yesterday, and I guess more of what's coming up today, and we'll be covering it live.
[00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:18.227]  I mean, here is this corrupt prosecutor that hired her boyfriend, lied about it, and then got caught giving him hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars, much of it in cash, that he would then go pay for trips in her name.
[00:01:18.727 --> 00:01:22.869]  So, clear money laundering going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:29.090]   Government money from her prosecutor's office given to him, which then he would
[00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.448]   go out and buy her tickets and all sorts of things and give her cash back, she would give
[00:01:33.448 --> 00:01:34.129]  him cash.
[00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:38.810]   And then she has the nerve to deny there's any relationship going on, even though we
[00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.649]  have the emails, the eyewitnesses, all of it.
[00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:48.409]   This is emblematic of the arrogance of the type of people that George Soros is financing
[00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.250]   and putting into judgeships, putting into prosecutor positions, putting into state attorney
[00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.370]  general's positions.
[00:01:55.773 --> 00:02:05.682]  They all basically behave the same because they know their tools of the Justice Department, even if they're state or local, and that they have been given a get out of jail free card.
[00:02:06.163 --> 00:02:12.749]   They are, above the law, Just like Biden and on down to the very, very bottom.
[00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.752]  And this is what happens in history when tyrannies take over.
[00:02:16.852 --> 00:02:27.440]  They get enough of their corrupt people in positions of power to be able to commit any crime they want, be as arrogant as they want, as long as they persecute the political opposition.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.465]  And our government can point at this stuff going on in China or Russia and say, oh, look, they're bad.
[00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:36.127]  But we don't live in China or Russia.
[00:02:37.014 --> 00:02:37.735]  We live here.
[00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:46.101]  And if I saw Republicans doing one-tenth of this to people, weaponizing the judiciary, I'd be totally against them.
[00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:47.563]  In fact, I don't like the Republican leadership.
[00:02:48.063 --> 00:02:49.964]  Mitch McConnell and the rest of them are almost as bad.
[00:02:50.685 --> 00:02:59.292]  But just sitting back and watching her testimony and listening to her, and then her trying to claim that it's racism, the reason all this is happening.
[00:03:00.293 --> 00:03:02.174]  She ran on getting Trump.
[00:03:02.575 --> 00:03:05.077]  So did Letitia James in New York.
[00:03:07.814 --> 00:03:13.059]  Absolute political operative judge in New York on the real estate case has already found Trump guilty.
[00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:14.660]  There is no jury.
[00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:16.943]  And so that verdict is set to come out today.
[00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:19.242]  They're coming for everybody, folks.
[00:03:19.342 --> 00:03:22.803]  As Trump said, they have to get through him to get to us.
[00:03:22.843 --> 00:03:25.744]  They have to get through InfoWars to get to you.
[00:03:26.185 --> 00:03:30.326]  That's why I'm asking you all to stand up, to speak out, and to support this broadcast.
[00:03:30.887 --> 00:03:37.029]  And tell everybody you know and those you don't know, random strangers, to tune in now at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.732]  We're going to go to break, but here's a clip of Fannie Willis, a short compilation, and we'll be right back.
[00:03:43.092 --> 00:03:44.993]  And she's reportedly going to be back on the stand today.
[00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:48.523]  I took out a large amount of money on my first campaign.
[00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:49.743]  I kept some of the cash of that.
[00:03:50.644 --> 00:03:53.106]  I took out a large amount of money on my first campaign.
[00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:54.326]  I kept some of the cash of that.
[00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:56.468]  Kept some of the cash of that.
[00:03:57.148 --> 00:04:01.031]  Like, to tell you, I just have cash in my house.
[00:04:01.071 --> 00:04:02.251]  I don't have as much today.
[00:04:02.592 --> 00:04:04.113]  And then he tells me how much it is.
[00:04:04.853 --> 00:04:06.094]  And I give him the money back.
[00:04:06.554 --> 00:04:09.296]  I don't... Just like you're asking me about the money with Robin.
[00:04:09.396 --> 00:04:10.416]  I don't do my friends like that.
[00:04:10.877 --> 00:04:13.779]  So if you tell me it's a G, then you're gonna get a thousand dollars.
[00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:16.940]  Whatever it is, I didn't ever make him produce receipts to me.
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.222]  Whatever he told me it was, I gave him the money back.
[00:04:19.962 --> 00:04:24.145]  I'm not gonna emasculate a black man, but I'm just telling you... I'm sorry, what?
[00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:27.867]  I'm not going to emasculate a black man.
[00:04:28.287 --> 00:04:28.968]  Did you understand that?
[00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:32.072]  I don't think we should discuss further.
[00:04:32.813 --> 00:04:37.739]  He also said that he was a world traveler and had been on many of the continents.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.282]  Have you been on any of those continents with him?
[00:04:41.704 --> 00:04:42.585]  Besides this one?
[00:04:43.707 --> 00:04:44.408]  Where's Belize?
[00:04:44.608 --> 00:04:45.349]  What continent is that?
[00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:46.470]  I'm not being funny, I don't know.
[00:04:47.613 --> 00:04:52.137]  I've been to the Bahamas with him.
[00:04:52.577 --> 00:04:53.838]  I've been with Faruba with him.
[00:04:54.018 --> 00:04:54.859]  Don't embarrass me.
[00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.601]  I'm not sure what continents those are on.
[00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:59.303]  Whatever continents those are, that's where I've been.
[00:04:59.343 --> 00:05:01.184]  I'm sure if I gave it some thought, I would tell you.
[00:05:01.204 --> 00:05:05.228]  But whatever continents those are, I've been to those locations.
[00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:12.273]  It's Friday, February 16th, 2024.
[00:05:12.313 --> 00:05:19.199]  And I want to kick the broadcast off with this headline in your face from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.702]  To save money, maybe you should skip breakfast.
[00:05:23.643 --> 00:05:27.346]  And the Atlantic says you should eat beans instead of meat.
[00:05:28.087 --> 00:05:36.992]   Ladies and gentlemen, they are building a giant Dystopic system in our faces and telling us it's prosperity.
[00:05:37.112 --> 00:05:39.072]  We're about to break it down right now.
[00:05:39.512 --> 00:05:41.093]  This is a great reset.
[00:05:41.453 --> 00:05:43.573]  This is the post-industrial world.
[00:05:43.934 --> 00:05:46.994]  This is the depopulation system in our face.
[00:05:50.856 --> 00:05:53.016]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:05:53.355 --> 00:05:58.795]   It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:05:58.795 --> 00:06:12.315]   Zero Hedge has written a short, but also very succinct and powerful
[00:06:12.315 --> 00:06:17.475]   boil down of a composite of Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal articles,
[00:06:17.995 --> 00:06:23.596]   WF statements and White House propaganda in the last few weeks and months.
[00:06:24.166 --> 00:06:25.767]  And so I'm just going to read the article.
[00:06:27.082 --> 00:06:28.203]  Here on air for you right now.
[00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:30.625]  It's also posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:06:30.645 --> 00:06:45.997]  Before I read it, it's very important to understand and to pull back and just read the headline for yourself to take in the arrogance of these people and what their Great Reset really means.
[00:06:46.737 --> 00:06:52.960]   Wall Street Journal tells readers to save money Maybe you should skip breakfast.
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.881]  I'm going to read that again.
[00:06:54.462 --> 00:06:59.867]  The Wall Street Journal tells readers, to save money, maybe you should skip breakfast.
[00:07:01.028 --> 00:07:14.841]  Now remember, cutting off much of the fertilizer, shutting down many of the farms around the world, this is all good to save the earth from climate change because particularly organic farming is bad.
[00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:16.242]  Factory farming is good.
[00:07:16.983 --> 00:07:21.067]  That's the UN and London Guardian and many other establishment mouthpieces openly saying that.
[00:07:21.087 --> 00:07:24.910]  Of course, this all flies in the face of common sense and reality.
[00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.694]  Then, separately, the UN comes out and says, oh, hundreds of millions are going to starve to death.
[00:07:30.334 --> 00:07:38.041]  UNICEF needs billions and billions of dollars more because the virus caused a breakdown in food production.
[00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:39.022]  No, the lockdowns.
[00:07:40.154 --> 00:07:41.795]  That went on for all these years, did that.
[00:07:42.476 --> 00:07:43.617]  And now, oh guess what?
[00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:47.560]  They didn't end when it comes to farms and food production around the world.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:53.585]  In fact, the controls incrementally shutting down that key infrastructure have only intensified.
[00:07:53.645 --> 00:07:59.729]  So, imagine the globalist party, the WFUN Trillionaire Club.
[00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.933]  And their slogan is, you will eat the bucks.
[00:08:04.653 --> 00:08:05.994]  You will owe nothing, you will like it.
[00:08:06.034 --> 00:08:07.375]  And you say, that's so dystopic.
[00:08:07.916 --> 00:08:08.977]  They'll never get away with that.
[00:08:09.881 --> 00:08:17.646]  That they are, to some extent, because the public is so incredibly ignorant about the nature of just how evil this plan is.
[00:08:17.666 --> 00:08:35.518]  Because even though they're saying we've broken the social contract, even though they're saying we're shutting down the normal infrastructure and killing oil drilling and gas production, even though they're shutting off the coal, even though they're saying the West isn't open for business, but it sure is in China and India, where their investments are.
[00:08:36.414 --> 00:08:48.184]  The public still hasn't wrapped their mind around the fact that this is administrative deindustrialization, which will lead to poverty, crime, and death, especially in the third world.
[00:08:48.824 --> 00:08:50.426]  So here's the amazing headline.
[00:08:50.786 --> 00:08:55.090]  Wall Street Journal tells readers who save money, maybe you should skip breakfast.
[00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.130]  That's how you save money.
[00:08:57.412 --> 00:09:09.058]   As the number of Bidenomics news stories soared, Polling data via RealClearPolitics shows the President's job approval rating fell.
[00:09:09.418 --> 00:09:18.120]  In other words, the American people quickly called BS on the PR campaign.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:28.343]  President Biden's attempt to sell Americans on Bidenomics could be one of the most significant marketing failures by an administration in an election cycle in modern times.
[00:09:29.103 --> 00:09:30.884]  The Klaus Schwab of the UN talked about this.
[00:09:31.775 --> 00:09:35.867]  They say we'll have the nation states implement our horrible draconian plans.
[00:09:37.168 --> 00:09:43.770]  Then they'll get the blame, and then we'll call for corporations and international groups to come in and fix the problem.
[00:09:43.810 --> 00:10:02.575]  But if we know it's the globalists that penetrated our governments and the cabinets that control our politicians, and that it's a global WFUN party doing this worldwide, well, they'll all be discredited, their programs will be stopped, and then finally, we'll take political power and be able to legally and lawfully, with due process, put their asses in prison.
[00:10:04.147 --> 00:10:11.769]  Continuing, according to Bloomberg data, the number of news stories mentioning Bidenomics in corporate media erupted in June of 2023.
[00:10:11.809 --> 00:10:22.512]  This was around the same time that the White House launched its propaganda campaign to persuade, trick the American people about the alleged success of the President's economic policies.
[00:10:23.152 --> 00:10:34.894]   As the number of Bidenomics news stories soared, polling data via RealClearPolitics shows the President's job approval rating In other words, the American people quickly called BS on
[00:10:34.894 --> 00:10:36.894]  the PR campaign.
[00:10:36.894 --> 00:10:47.634]   Continuing, in this era of failure, legacy media told consumers inflation is their fault,
[00:10:47.634 --> 00:10:53.334]   but ignore the fellow reserves massive easing program during the COVID era and the fellow
[00:10:53.334 --> 00:10:57.894]   government's helicopter dropping trillions of dollars blindly across the economy.
[00:10:58.345 --> 00:10:59.246]  Not quite blindly.
[00:10:59.306 --> 00:11:01.948]  Most of it to key globalist banks and to themselves.
[00:11:01.968 --> 00:11:06.972]  Then they do the real investment, buy up the infrastructure and pass us all the debt and inflation.
[00:11:07.713 --> 00:11:09.394]  Here's the Atlantic's headline.
[00:11:10.174 --> 00:11:11.656]  Inflation is your fault.
[00:11:12.356 --> 00:11:18.577]  If people are so mad about high prices, why do they keep buying so many expensive things?
[00:11:19.577 --> 00:11:22.478]  And of course, that publication is a big apologist for Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:11:23.218 --> 00:11:27.359]  Oh, because the owner is a big visitor to it, Steve Jobs' widow.
[00:11:28.099 --> 00:11:41.849]   Remember this Bloomberg opinion piece from 2022 that told readers who made under $300,000 a year and suffer from high inflation, try lentils, beans, Instead of meat.
[00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.251]  Here's that headline from Bloomberg.
[00:11:44.852 --> 00:11:45.973]  Inflation stings.
[00:11:46.073 --> 00:11:49.256]  Most of you earn less.
[00:11:49.276 --> 00:11:49.256]  300,000.
[00:11:49.716 --> 00:11:51.078]  Here's how to deal with it.
[00:11:51.758 --> 00:11:52.719]  Ah, yes.
[00:11:52.939 --> 00:11:53.420]  Earn less.
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.120]  That will fix it.
[00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:55.301]  Take the bus.
[00:11:56.559 --> 00:11:57.340]  Don't buy in bulk.
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.421]  Everybody knows if you buy in bulk, you save money.
[00:12:00.081 --> 00:12:01.342]  Just all the worst advice.
[00:12:01.362 --> 00:12:05.945]  It's like telling a kid that can't swim that's three years old to put bowling balls to your legs and jump on the deep end.
[00:12:06.546 --> 00:12:07.867]  Try lentils instead of meat.
[00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:10.789]  Nobody said this would be fun.
[00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:18.394]  I told everybody when they shut the economy down and people sat around watching Netflix that it was pulling the rug out from under the economy.
[00:12:18.454 --> 00:12:19.315]  It was all part of their plan.
[00:12:20.327 --> 00:12:27.014]  And now the Wall Street Journal told readers this week, to save money, maybe you should skip breakfast.
[00:12:27.034 --> 00:12:31.178]  Of course, how about you skip all three meals in areas of Latin America, Africa, and starve to death?
[00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:36.723]  Only the strongest military age men can be transferred by the UN to our nations.
[00:12:39.767 --> 00:12:45.329]  As another reminder, lower inflation touted by the White House does not mean lower prices.
[00:12:45.369 --> 00:12:46.749]  We'll put that graph on screen.
[00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:51.770]  And the consumer environment is getting worse, not better, ahead of the elections.
[00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:55.551]  The Atlantic pointing fingers at consumers for inflation.
[00:12:55.591 --> 00:12:57.732]  Bloomberg advised readers to eat lentils.
[00:12:57.792 --> 00:13:01.633]  The Wall Street Journal suggests skipping breakfast are all indicators of the U.S.
[00:13:01.653 --> 00:13:02.473]  economy in distress.
[00:13:02.874 --> 00:13:07.155]  In stark contrast, the White House's continuous assurance that everything is fine.
[00:13:09.358 --> 00:13:11.359]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:14.700]  Just go read that short article at InfoWars.com or ZeroEdge.com.
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.200]  Share it with everybody you know.
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:21.142]  I'm going to post it and this audio report on X. Obviously, I'm airing it here on my show today.
[00:13:21.162 --> 00:13:24.623]  I've got more of these reports coming today, and I'll be back live at Studio Sunday.
[00:13:24.643 --> 00:13:30.284]  Owen and the rest of the crew are doing a great job today, but just sit back and think about for a moment.
[00:13:30.324 --> 00:13:31.005]  Cogitate.
[00:13:31.105 --> 00:13:31.565]  Meditate.
[00:13:32.669 --> 00:13:46.060]  On the arrogance of the corporate dying media with articles in Cosmopolitan about, have a baby, go to a satanic temple abortion clinic and they will sacrifice it with you.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:52.085]  They actually have satanic sponsored abortion clinics now where women go to say it's a sacrifice.
[00:13:52.866 --> 00:13:59.031]  And the New York Times and all these groups are pushing this and you're like, well that's just completely over the top, they're trolling us.
[00:13:59.952 --> 00:14:09.177]  No, they're getting ready for a post-industrial world and training you to not stand together and training you to be nihilistic and satanic like they are.
[00:14:09.718 --> 00:14:12.679]  These are mercenaries and minions and servants of the system.
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.481]  Some of them love it, some of them just go along with it.
[00:14:15.841 --> 00:14:22.905]  But in the final equation, they have sold out to their own destruction and hell loves company.
[00:14:23.626 --> 00:14:25.247]  Misery loves company.
[00:14:26.109 --> 00:14:30.457]  And as I started this important breakdown, I'm going to end with this again.
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:37.290]  The globalists are trying to sell sand to people in the Sahara instead of iced tea.
[00:14:38.715 --> 00:14:39.776]  This is unpopular.
[00:14:39.956 --> 00:14:40.737]  This is evil.
[00:14:41.077 --> 00:14:41.878]  This is wrong.
[00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:43.460]  It doesn't save the Earth.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.622]  The globals don't care about the Earth.
[00:14:46.082 --> 00:14:58.234]  They're positioning themselves for mass forced depopulation, climate lockdowns, race wars, and other nightmarish systems they're putting into place all around us.
[00:14:58.674 --> 00:15:21.853]   So whatever you see on national television, Whatever you see Disney's putting out, whatever you see as drug commercials, whatever you see being put out by the big colleges, all of it is written up by the big think tanks and is designed to poison you, is designed to destroy you, is literally designed to kill you after they suck everything out of you, including your soul.
[00:15:22.782 --> 00:15:28.644]  That's why it's beyond important to spread the word about this broadcast, one of the main beacons of light against this evil.
[00:15:29.144 --> 00:15:32.906]  And I know over 30 years people have thought, man, this guy's too extreme, it's not that bad.
[00:15:33.406 --> 00:15:38.627]  Now you're seeing the real face of this, ladies and gentlemen, and it's going to get a lot worse a lot quicker.
[00:15:39.308 --> 00:15:50.132]   So our lives, our fortune, our children, our souls depend on standing against this evil now and admitting That we're under attack.
[00:15:50.312 --> 00:15:52.533]  And as I've said a thousand times, we didn't ask for this fight.
[00:15:53.574 --> 00:15:55.815]  But if they want a fight, they better believe they've got one.
[00:15:56.276 --> 00:15:59.017]  Back to live broadcast, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:16:01.119 --> 00:16:01.899]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:07.863]  And yes, we are now inside the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:16:07.923 --> 00:16:10.385]  Owen Troyer here joining you.
[00:16:10.425 --> 00:16:13.647]  Going to be rejoined by Alex coming up shortly.
[00:16:15.047 --> 00:16:16.548]  And he's got a bunch of news.
[00:16:17.708 --> 00:17:01.776]   I've got a bunch of news and there's so many stories that when you put it on the table and then you compare it to what else is going on you say okay well this just proves we're being lied to this just proves this is propaganda I'll explain what I'm talking about in a second but you hear Alex Jones reporting there and you see all the fear-mongering of war in the media Man, you might want to start thinking about how you're going to protect your family and what type of insurance you can have to make sure you aren't in a position where you're starved out.
[00:17:02.776 --> 00:17:07.899]  So, I'm not going to turn this into a long plug, but this is just the reality of the situation that we live in.
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.321]  You might want to get storable foods.
[00:17:12.774 --> 00:17:14.475]  And yeah, we sell storable foods.
[00:17:15.175 --> 00:17:17.857]  Because we like having storable food.
[00:17:17.937 --> 00:17:20.318]  Because we like having an emergency food supply.
[00:17:20.718 --> 00:17:22.019]  And we want you to have the same.
[00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:28.041]  So we went out and found the highest quality emergency food supplies at the lowest price.
[00:17:28.262 --> 00:17:31.623]  And that's what we deliver for you at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:17:31.663 --> 00:17:32.424]  And there's options.
[00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:33.024]  There's the year.
[00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:42.594]  Long food supply, there's the sixth month, there's the three month, there's the four week, and there's all kinds of other sub options inside of that as well.
[00:17:43.055 --> 00:17:45.336]  Highest quality storable foods at the lowest price.
[00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:46.937]  25 year shelf life.
[00:17:47.397 --> 00:17:51.499]  Comes in a high quality container as well, so I mean it's immediately ready for storage.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.561]  And it's insurance you can eat.
[00:17:56.482 --> 00:17:58.423]  You'd rather have it and not need it.
[00:17:59.793 --> 00:18:02.154]  Then need it and not have it.
[00:18:02.894 --> 00:18:07.416]  So do your emergency food supply shopping at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:07.456 --> 00:18:08.296]  And who knows what it could be?
[00:18:08.436 --> 00:18:15.119]  War, power grid shutdown, even just major weather catastrophe, what have you.
[00:18:15.239 --> 00:18:15.939]  That happens too.
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.401]  Or, you know, just Democrats or government globalists ruining the country.
[00:18:22.181 --> 00:18:25.743]  But it's your support at InfoWarsStore.com that keeps this transmission on the air.
[00:18:25.843 --> 00:18:26.623]  All right, now.
[00:18:28.263 --> 00:18:32.504]  Let's look at some of the news I have before Alex rejoins us with some other breaking news.
[00:18:33.804 --> 00:18:40.005]  And then also we're going to be hearing from Lou Dobbs with Alex in the second hour today.
[00:18:40.826 --> 00:18:43.846]  So very excited Lou Dobbs on the Alex Jones Show today with Alex.
[00:18:46.287 --> 00:18:52.228]  The Fannie Willis testimony yesterday was such an embarrassment to her case.
[00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:58.464]  And to herself in general, that they decided not to put her back on the stand today.
[00:19:00.145 --> 00:19:01.987]  That's how bad it was.
[00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:17.081]  And as I was following this yesterday, and then observing some of the clips last night, and then looking at some of the commentary, it's the same old story.
[00:19:19.161 --> 00:19:23.464]  You ask a diehard Democrat-Liberal, they'll tell you Joe Biden is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[00:19:24.285 --> 00:19:25.486]  Greatest economy ever.
[00:19:25.967 --> 00:19:27.888]  There's peace on planet Earth thanks to Joe Biden.
[00:19:27.948 --> 00:19:29.369]  It's just total reverse reality.
[00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.671]  Totally fully bought into the propaganda.
[00:19:31.691 --> 00:19:32.492]  Just total BS.
[00:19:33.052 --> 00:19:34.854]  And they say the same thing about Fannie Willis.
[00:19:34.934 --> 00:19:36.215]  Greatest testimony ever.
[00:19:36.555 --> 00:19:41.139]  She showed how brave and how courageous and how strong and smart and everything.
[00:19:41.459 --> 00:19:43.240]  And the truth is the exact opposite.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.281]  She embarrassed herself.
[00:19:45.342 --> 00:19:46.383]  She embarrassed her family.
[00:19:47.624 --> 00:19:53.254]   And she was so bad I mean, just a neutral observer would see how bad she was.
[00:19:54.094 --> 00:20:00.675]  She was so bad that they didn't bring her back up to the stand today.
[00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:22.748]   Now, her father was up there, and, you know, he has nothing to do with this, but clearly he sees what's going on, and it appears that Fannie Willis was, yes, Moving a bunch of money around, perhaps even admitting to committing campaign finance violations.
[00:20:25.309 --> 00:20:25.970]  Crazy enough.
[00:20:27.871 --> 00:20:31.092]  And taking vacations with her romantic partner.
[00:20:33.654 --> 00:20:44.240]  Even though she promised Fulton County when she got the job and sit down interview, she said, I promise I'll never have romantic relationships with anybody who I work with.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:44.720]  Oops.
[00:20:46.567 --> 00:20:46.867]  Oops.
[00:20:47.768 --> 00:20:55.534]  And then they allegedly lied about that in the court filings because other witnesses came up and said, nope, they'd been in a relationship before 2020.
[00:20:55.694 --> 00:21:03.080]  And I'd seen them smooching and hugging.
[00:21:05.661 --> 00:21:15.229]  And as if that's not all embarrassing enough for Fannie, she wore her dress backwards.
[00:21:17.888 --> 00:21:25.309]  And, you know, obviously I'm not some big fashion, uh, female fashion critique artist here or something like that.
[00:21:25.689 --> 00:21:30.350]  But, it was funny, when I saw her in the dress, I was like, something feels off about this.
[00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.191]  Is it just her body shape, or what's the deal?
[00:21:33.751 --> 00:21:46.133]  Well, some women noticed, they found the dress, they found the website where you can buy the dress, and yes, indeed, Fannie Willis was wearing it backwards.
[00:21:47.469 --> 00:21:50.350]  But maybe she's just taken from Jill Biden, because Jill Biden is famous for that, too.
[00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:56.772]  Now, there's so much more here.
[00:21:57.512 --> 00:22:02.954]  I'm going to let Alex tell some other of these stories when it comes to the situation with Alexei Navalny.
[00:22:04.234 --> 00:22:06.935]  I mean, I just say quickly, like, I don't know what to think.
[00:22:07.055 --> 00:22:09.236]  I could easily see Putin actually doing this.
[00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:15.898]  The timing seems way too convenient for the deep state and the military-industrial complex.
[00:22:17.003 --> 00:22:17.743]  Against Russia?
[00:22:18.544 --> 00:22:27.307]  However, I also think Putin realizes that, I mean, if he wanted to do this, he sees how weak the Biden administration is.
[00:22:27.748 --> 00:22:30.089]  He sees how unpopular the Biden administration is.
[00:22:30.429 --> 00:22:35.051]  He sees how the American people don't trust the intelligence communities, don't trust the media.
[00:22:35.471 --> 00:22:41.693]  So if you were going to do it, maybe it's like, well, maybe now is the time, because people in America don't trust any of the establishments, so they won't believe this.
[00:22:43.634 --> 00:22:51.086]   But then it kind of gives the perfect gift To the deep state and military-industrial complex to continue their war on Russia.
[00:22:51.606 --> 00:22:52.187]  But you know what?
[00:22:53.748 --> 00:22:57.490]  How about, did Putin have Nalvany killed or not?
[00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.291]  How about I don't care?
[00:23:01.132 --> 00:23:08.036]  How about we've had five January 6th political prisoners kill themselves because of what the Democrats have done.
[00:23:08.396 --> 00:23:13.078]  How about we had Ukraine kill journalist Gonzalo Lira, American journalist.
[00:23:13.098 --> 00:23:13.679]  How about that?
[00:23:15.954 --> 00:23:19.697]  Neither of those stories got any of the attention.
[00:23:20.417 --> 00:23:25.020]  Not a fraction of the attention that this Novani story has.
[00:23:25.761 --> 00:23:29.704]  Which would again lead me to believe that it's just propaganda or something else going on.
[00:23:30.304 --> 00:23:33.286]  But, why is it we don't care about Gonzalo Lira?
[00:23:34.126 --> 00:23:37.965]   Why is it we don't care about the American political prisoners that have been killed?
[00:23:37.965 --> 00:23:44.405]  So.
[00:23:45.385 --> 00:24:00.028]  Then you had Tucker, who's I guess still in Russia, shooting videos at the supermarkets and the subway stations and comparing life in American cities to Russian cities and saying, hey, what what do you notice here?
[00:24:00.068 --> 00:24:00.728]  What's the difference?
[00:24:00.808 --> 00:24:01.668]  Oh, there's no poverty.
[00:24:01.708 --> 00:24:02.508]  There's no crime.
[00:24:02.528 --> 00:24:03.408]  There's no graffiti.
[00:24:04.029 --> 00:24:06.749]  People respect the streets and they respect each other.
[00:24:06.949 --> 00:24:09.170]  You just don't get that in American cities.
[00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:11.290]  So we'll probably play some of that coming up.
[00:24:15.267 --> 00:24:20.230]  We've got the Democrats continuing to run on the abortion issue.
[00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.131]  This is gonna be their big issue for 2024 is abortion.
[00:24:23.151 --> 00:24:26.813]  They've changed their tack a little bit, but we'll have that coming up for you.
[00:24:27.433 --> 00:24:32.436]  We got a ton of clips from the Fannie Willis, Nathan Wade testimony.
[00:24:32.496 --> 00:24:37.018]  I mean, it'd be funny if it wasn't so pathetic.
[00:24:37.318 --> 00:24:49.169]   It'd be funny if it wasn't So scary that these people are in charge and they will illegally and illegitimately persecute you.
[00:24:50.109 --> 00:24:52.031]  It might be funny, but that's what's going on.
[00:24:52.071 --> 00:24:52.971]  So we got all of those clips.
[00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:53.992]  We're going to play those too.
[00:24:55.913 --> 00:24:59.735]  Now, let me do something here before we go to break and get rejoined by Alex on the other side.
[00:24:59.855 --> 00:25:07.199]  This is the most current polling results when it comes to the 2024 election.
[00:25:10.222 --> 00:25:12.204]  And guys, let's either pull that on the screen or doc cam this.
[00:25:12.484 --> 00:25:23.493]  And I would just ask, what do you notice about this Electoral College map, which is where the current polling is for the 2024 election?
[00:25:24.494 --> 00:25:25.635]  What stands out?
[00:25:26.436 --> 00:25:27.617]  Biden versus Trump.
[00:25:29.218 --> 00:25:30.019]  Well, isn't it obvious?
[00:25:32.028 --> 00:25:35.511]  Ladies and gentlemen, these are the real results.
[00:25:36.212 --> 00:25:41.356]  Before all the Biden voter fraud, these are the real results of the 2020 election.
[00:25:42.797 --> 00:25:44.238]  Donald Trump won.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:49.663]  Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona.
[00:25:50.885 --> 00:26:08.078]  Before all the voter fraud came in, before all the mail-in ballots came in, before the water main breaks, and the mail delivery trucks, and the pulling out secret briefcases from under the table when the counting was supposed to stop, midnight when Trump was leading in all those states, but then at 3.30 Biden had the 1% lead.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:16.184]  These were your real results from the 2020 election.
[00:26:16.985 --> 00:26:20.508]  Donald Trump had over 300 electoral college votes.
[00:26:22.125 --> 00:26:23.026]  Those are your real results.
[00:26:25.687 --> 00:26:31.231]  But see, everybody's seeing this today and saying, oh, look, you know, Trump has a commanding lead on Biden.
[00:26:32.612 --> 00:26:34.253]  Oh, look, the Democrats are in trouble.
[00:26:35.674 --> 00:26:37.475]  Well, yeah, of course they are.
[00:26:38.156 --> 00:26:39.477]  The economy's in bad shape.
[00:26:41.178 --> 00:26:42.719]  There's war all over the planet.
[00:26:43.419 --> 00:26:45.381]  People don't even feel safe in their own cities.
[00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:47.382]  You can go on and on.
[00:26:47.942 --> 00:26:51.625]  The constant lying, gaslighting, the border, everything else we get.
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.721]  We got news on the border as well.
[00:26:55.483 --> 00:26:59.007]  No, these were your results from the 2020 election.
[00:26:59.267 --> 00:26:59.568]  Right here.
[00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.211]  That's what you have.
[00:27:03.472 --> 00:27:04.393]  Before all the voter fraud.
[00:27:06.395 --> 00:27:07.616]  It's exactly where we were at.
[00:27:09.719 --> 00:27:13.403]  And then Joe Biden had millions of illegitimate votes pour in.
[00:27:14.713 --> 00:27:19.376]  At 3 o'clock in the morning to put him ahead in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia.
[00:27:20.097 --> 00:27:25.180]  But we don't need to sit here and re-litigate this on air.
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.381]  We already know what happened.
[00:27:26.761 --> 00:27:28.442]  Anybody paying attention knows what happened.
[00:27:28.842 --> 00:27:35.447]  But then I'm supposed to care about Putin and Nulvaney when my own government throws me in jail for telling you that.
[00:27:36.447 --> 00:27:38.509]  So, whatever happened to Nulvaney?
[00:27:39.571 --> 00:27:45.492]  Yeah, we can talk about it, but no, we've got our own problems with the Biden administration, much bigger than Putin problems.
[00:27:45.852 --> 00:27:47.693]  But folks, we're standing up for our rights.
[00:27:47.713 --> 00:27:48.793]  We're standing up for your rights.
[00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:51.213]  We're standing up for all of our freedoms and our children.
[00:27:51.433 --> 00:27:59.075]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at InfoWarsTore.com, then I'm not bribing at you.
[00:27:59.095 --> 00:28:00.195]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[00:28:01.275 --> 00:28:04.576]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:28:05.484 --> 00:28:12.470]  If just a half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our great supplements and then reorder them because they really work.
[00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:13.371]  Just try it.
[00:28:13.991 --> 00:28:15.933]  We would be able to do so many things.
[00:28:16.293 --> 00:28:20.076]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.
[00:28:20.617 --> 00:28:26.837]   Infowarsstore.com It's been sold out, it's back in stock, reformulated even
[00:28:26.837 --> 00:28:27.447]  stronger.

[00:28:30.447 --> 00:28:34.447]   Vasodilation. It's got a lot of wonderful side effects, and I mean good ones.
[00:28:34.447 --> 00:28:38.447]   I'm going to leave it at that. It is powerful, so be careful with it.
[00:28:38.447 --> 00:28:45.447]  Next Level Foundational Energy, info@store.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:28:45.447 --> 00:28:55.056]   Alexei Navalny, a Russian political prisoner, one of the main opposition groups against Putin, though he
[00:28:55.056 --> 00:29:00.687]   never got more than 2%, collapsed reportedly and died while working at a Siberian
[00:29:00.687 --> 00:29:04.447]  work camp in a rural area.
[00:29:04.762 --> 00:29:08.682]  Now, do Russian government officials have people killed?
[00:29:08.702 --> 00:29:10.643]  Yeah, do bears go to the bathroom in the woods?
[00:29:11.343 --> 00:29:12.323]  Do fish swim in the sea?
[00:29:12.343 --> 00:29:13.243]  Do birds fly in the air?
[00:29:14.144 --> 00:29:15.544]  This certainly could have been Putin.
[00:29:16.781 --> 00:29:28.626]  Having him killed, but there he is serving a multi-decade prison sentence, and then magically right after the big Tucker Carlson interview and Russia decisively winning the Ukraine war, this happens.
[00:29:29.066 --> 00:29:31.367]  Where is the motive for Putin to have him killed?
[00:29:31.968 --> 00:29:49.639]   I'm purely speculating here, but how do we know that there wasn't a bounty on his head by Western intelligence agencies, and Russia is just as infiltrated as America, and that somebody killed him So that it could be blamed on Putin, because they're certainly trying to use that now.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:54.263]  Biden had previously said nothing had better happen to Navalny.
[00:29:55.023 --> 00:29:57.325]  So I think it's too early to tell here, but I'll just say this.
[00:29:58.846 --> 00:30:02.429]  We saw Jeffrey Epstein's neck broken in three places, according to the coroner.
[00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:04.530]  The coroner said it looked like homicide to him.
[00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:05.731]  That got swept under the rug.
[00:30:06.712 --> 00:30:12.970]   We saw the then Attorney General Barr come out and try to cover it all up.
[00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.731]  They turned off the cameras in the prison.
[00:30:15.371 --> 00:30:16.912]  It just goes on and on and on.
[00:30:17.012 --> 00:30:24.176]  So, for the West to point their finger at Putin and say, look, look, they're the worst people on earth, while this type of political murder is going on here.
[00:30:24.196 --> 00:30:26.498]  I mean, look what happened at the Capitol on January 6th.
[00:30:26.578 --> 00:30:38.591]   Look how they gunned a woman down in cold blood, claiming shots had been fired and killed four other citizens that day, and then lied and said that police Had been killed that day.
[00:30:38.771 --> 00:30:42.254]  So my job is not being an apologist for Putin or for Russia.
[00:30:42.274 --> 00:30:45.736]  I'm just saying the timing of this is very, very suspicious.
[00:30:47.157 --> 00:30:49.498]  Also, he could have had a heart attack and really died for real.
[00:30:49.879 --> 00:30:51.240]  I tend to not think that's the case.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.280]  It probably was foul play.
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.883]  But again, we don't know any of that.
[00:30:56.343 --> 00:31:02.208]  But if you go to X or go to Facebook or go to the National News, oh, Putin did it for sure, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:02.669 --> 00:31:10.836]  Why would Putin kill somebody who's unpopular, who's in prison, and then give the Western establishment a big win?
[00:31:11.357 --> 00:31:14.059]  This is while Zelensky can't get his war funding through Congress.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.963]  This is while he's having to reshuffle generals and leaders.
[00:31:18.463 --> 00:31:20.505]  He's on the verge of being thrown out himself.
[00:31:21.946 --> 00:31:27.457]   Again, 95% of what I cover on air is researched information and facts.
[00:31:28.478 --> 00:31:29.139]  5% speculation.
[00:31:29.179 --> 00:31:30.661]  I'm saying this is speculation.
[00:31:31.322 --> 00:31:32.884]  And so I don't know what happened there.
[00:31:32.904 --> 00:31:37.751]  But it's definitely food for thought to bring up these different angles and issues that I don't see.
[00:31:38.852 --> 00:31:50.576]  Putin's immediate motive, while this guy was in a Siberian work camp, to have him killed, when obviously this would give Putin a black eye any way you slice it.
[00:31:50.996 --> 00:31:56.258]  We'll be covering this more at RealAlexJones on X and at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:31:57.478 --> 00:31:58.178]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:31:59.499 --> 00:32:05.821]  And I would say, I'm kind of on the same page seeing the news about Nalvany.
[00:32:07.874 --> 00:32:18.408]  And one of the things you like to do, you don't want to be the tail wagging the dog here, but you always kind of see the response, see the propaganda laid out, and then that might point you in a direction to reach a conclusion here.
[00:32:18.468 --> 00:32:21.932]  So I've got all the same actors that lied to the American people.
[00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:30.219]  I've got all the same actors that engage in propaganda against the American people, and they're the ones telling me Putin killed Nalvany.
[00:32:30.479 --> 00:32:39.891]  Now again, if you say, well, I'm going to assume these people are lying to me all the time, and I'm just going to take the opposite as the truth, well that's also a dangerous psychology, because then you can be deceived in that manner.
[00:32:41.516 --> 00:32:50.598]  But you've got Eric Swalwell today telling you, this is the statement he made this morning rather, let Nalvany's death be a warning to America.
[00:32:50.718 --> 00:32:53.398]  If returned to power, Donald Trump will jail his opponents.
[00:32:53.878 --> 00:32:54.719]  I mean, this is absurd.
[00:32:55.099 --> 00:32:56.919]  Joe Biden is jailing his opponents.
[00:32:58.519 --> 00:33:03.080]  There were thousands put in prison for January 6th.
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.721]  I was put in prison for my speech.
[00:33:05.121 --> 00:33:09.396]   I was put in prison For not believing the 2020 election results.
[00:33:09.496 --> 00:33:13.363]  I came on air today and I told you that they stole the election from Donald Trump.
[00:33:13.403 --> 00:33:14.826]  Are they going to imprison me again?
[00:33:14.846 --> 00:33:19.394]  I get harassed from the government regularly, daily.
[00:33:21.075 --> 00:33:24.158]  I get drug tested, probation meetings, visits.
[00:33:24.858 --> 00:33:26.940]  I have to deal with this corruption, the Biden administration.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.302]  And you're going to sit here and tell me, Putin, Putin, Putin.
[00:33:30.023 --> 00:33:31.724]  No, I'm dealing with Biden, Biden, Biden.
[00:33:31.764 --> 00:33:32.965]  I'm dealing with Merrick Garland.
[00:33:33.246 --> 00:33:34.987]  I'm dealing with the corrupt Justice Department.
[00:33:35.668 --> 00:33:37.790]  That's my own country persecuting me.
[00:33:39.151 --> 00:33:40.472]  Did Putin kill Novena or not?
[00:33:40.812 --> 00:33:41.393]  I don't know.
[00:33:41.793 --> 00:33:43.074]  Kind of don't care either.
[00:33:45.116 --> 00:33:46.077]  I got my own problems.
[00:33:47.881 --> 00:33:52.143]  And then they say Trump's going to jail his opponents when that's exactly what the Democrats are doing.
[00:33:55.804 --> 00:34:00.686]  Mike Pence says, there's no room in the Republican Party for apologists for Putin.
[00:34:00.846 --> 00:34:02.746]  Rip Alexei Nalvany.
[00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:06.648]  Hey Mike Pence, did you say anything about Gonzalo Lira?
[00:34:06.668 --> 00:34:09.729]  Hey Mike Pence, read the room.
[00:34:10.269 --> 00:34:13.970]  Actually, there's no room in the Republican Party for you anymore, bud.
[00:34:14.371 --> 00:34:15.411]  You're the one that's out.
[00:34:18.041 --> 00:34:19.882]  Not Putin-apologists.
[00:34:23.264 --> 00:34:27.587]  Oh, so Tucker Carlson going over to Russia and doing an interview with Putin, that's a Putin-apologist?
[00:34:28.908 --> 00:34:34.032]  Tucker Carlson going over to Russia and filming their grocery stores and their subways, that's a Putin-apologist?
[00:34:35.653 --> 00:34:39.315]  Just making observations about Russian civilization and life, that's a Putin-apologist?
[00:34:40.596 --> 00:34:41.897]  No, it's embarrassing is what it is.
[00:34:42.577 --> 00:34:53.319]   It's embarrassing because Russians In major metropolitan areas, Russians living in their big cities are living better than we are.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.120]  That's what's embarrassing.
[00:34:56.441 --> 00:34:57.661]  Is that a Putin apologist?
[00:34:57.761 --> 00:35:06.444]  Am I a Putin apologist for observing that you can go into a Russian subway and it's nice, and you're not going to get mugged or robbed, it doesn't stink like shit, and there isn't graffiti everywhere?
[00:35:06.945 --> 00:35:08.105]  And people begging you for money?
[00:35:10.606 --> 00:35:13.167]  With the trains falling apart, holes in the ceiling?
[00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:19.069]  It looks like a 19th century library or something?
[00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:21.030]  A museum?
[00:35:23.192 --> 00:35:24.993]  Is that a Putin apologist for observing that fact?
[00:35:25.273 --> 00:35:29.216]  Tucker Carlson goes over to Russia, goes to the grocery store, buys groceries.
[00:35:30.596 --> 00:35:35.320]  I guess, I don't know if he has a family of four or whatever, but he says, I'm gonna buy enough groceries for a family of four in Russia.
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.440]  I know what it costs in America.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.762]  Oh wow, it's cheaper in Russia and the food quality is better.
[00:35:39.042 --> 00:35:41.042]  Is that a Putin-pologist?
[00:35:41.042 --> 00:35:51.042]   When Tucker Carlson goes to the equivalent of McDonald's, because I guess part of the U.S.
[00:35:50.672 --> 00:35:52.072]  sanctions is they don't get McDonald's.
[00:35:52.392 --> 00:35:53.352]  Oh no, how will they survive?
[00:35:54.292 --> 00:36:01.914]  So they came up with their own burger chain, and Tucker goes there, and he buys the equivalent of what would be like a Big Mac meal, and it's seven bucks.
[00:36:05.774 --> 00:36:06.794]  And it doesn't taste like cardboard.
[00:36:06.835 --> 00:36:08.855]  Is that a Putin apologist for just observing these things?
[00:36:11.135 --> 00:36:12.556]  Maybe Putin did have Novena killed.
[00:36:13.136 --> 00:36:15.056]  Doesn't change the fact that their subways are nicer.
[00:36:17.674 --> 00:36:25.622]  And then Mike Pence is going to tell you, no room in the Republican Party for Putin apologists, except everybody staring at Mike Pence in the room saying, hey, why are you still here?
[00:36:27.404 --> 00:36:28.185]  We don't like you.
[00:36:30.847 --> 00:36:32.429]  You're the one we're sick of, actually.
[00:36:36.633 --> 00:36:44.816]   Now, we're going to probably come back From the, in the third hour today, and maybe we'll play some of these Tucker Carlson clips.
[00:36:44.916 --> 00:36:48.617]  I've also got news on the open border that's out of control.
[00:36:50.398 --> 00:36:54.479]  And it's exactly as we predicted, confirmed now by NBC News reporting.
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.842]  Yeah, maybe they'll stop coming to Texas momentarily, but they're just gonna go to Arizona and California.
[00:37:02.162 --> 00:37:03.182]  Now it's confirmed!
[00:37:03.483 --> 00:37:07.044]  Arizona, California, every day getting a new record number of border crossings.
[00:37:09.417 --> 00:37:10.477]  Yeah, no kidding.
[00:37:10.917 --> 00:37:12.298]  Oh, you thought they would just stop coming?
[00:37:12.738 --> 00:37:12.998]  Please.
[00:37:13.998 --> 00:37:14.638]  Who thought that?
[00:37:16.639 --> 00:37:17.459]  So we're going to talk about that.
[00:37:17.479 --> 00:37:22.500]  But when we come back in the next segment, I'm going to lay in all these Fannie Willis and Nathan Wade clips.
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.920]  Some of them are funny, but more than anything, it's just embarrassing.
[00:37:25.921 --> 00:37:27.301]  It's embarrassing for our country.
[00:37:29.061 --> 00:37:34.988]   And I understand this whole concept that, well, you know, Well, let's just call it what it is.
[00:37:35.549 --> 00:37:40.450]  What else can I assume other than Fannie Willis is a diversity hire?
[00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:44.331]  Fannie Willis is a diversity college graduate.
[00:37:46.012 --> 00:37:51.673]  Because when you see this woman on the stand, you ask yourself, how did she graduate college?
[00:37:52.033 --> 00:37:53.654]  How did she pass the bar exam?
[00:37:53.674 --> 00:37:55.394]  And how did she become a district attorney?
[00:37:55.794 --> 00:37:57.055]  She's not very bright.
[00:37:58.935 --> 00:38:00.016]  Diversity hires.
[00:38:01.092 --> 00:38:02.152]  Diversity hires.
[00:38:02.172 --> 00:38:04.353]  We're going to come back and play all these clips.
[00:38:04.453 --> 00:38:06.214]  This stuff is just, it's just crazy.
[00:38:06.594 --> 00:38:08.215]  And these are the people that want to conquer you.
[00:38:08.275 --> 00:38:09.795]  These are the people that want to destroy the country.
[00:38:10.035 --> 00:38:11.376]  They don't even know where Belize is on a map.
[00:38:11.396 --> 00:38:15.978]  All right, we're going to get to some of these Fannie Willis clips.
[00:38:16.538 --> 00:38:19.419]  And, well, she might be in trouble.
[00:38:19.499 --> 00:38:19.999]  I doubt it.
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.601]  But Joe Biden is live right now, guys.
[00:38:24.621 --> 00:38:26.222]  Let's just pop this up on the screen.
[00:38:27.022 --> 00:38:29.343]  And I really don't care to hear from Biden right now.
[00:38:30.353 --> 00:38:32.915]  But maybe we should just see what he's talking about.
[00:38:32.935 --> 00:38:36.797]  He's addressing the nation on the Mulvaney killing, okay?
[00:38:38.298 --> 00:38:48.925]  So again, I don't want to be the dog getting wagged by the tail here, but it's just like, this all seems way too scripted to believe it was Putin at this point.
[00:38:49.905 --> 00:38:51.306]  Now again, I can see it being Putin.
[00:38:51.426 --> 00:38:57.230]  At this point you feel that, you know that the American citizens don't trust their media, don't trust their government.
[00:38:58.004 --> 00:39:01.727]  And you know Joe Biden is weak, so if you're gonna kill Nelvany, I guess, you know, now's the time.
[00:39:02.688 --> 00:39:14.356]  But it's just like, we don't have press conferences for Gonzalo Lira, who gets killed in a Ukrainian prison, tortured and killed, but we do press conferences within hours of Nelvany being killed.
[00:39:14.396 --> 00:39:16.978]  Is Biden even still alive, guys, or did he already walk away?
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.742]  So, so he spoke for like, what, maybe five minutes?
[00:39:22.967 --> 00:39:24.068]  So, okay.
[00:39:24.588 --> 00:39:32.272]  So Biden walks up to the podium for five minutes, tells you how bad Putin is, and then he killed Mulvaney with no proof, and then goes back to nappy time.
[00:39:33.553 --> 00:39:35.374]  So we were gonna carry it, but he's already done speaking.
[00:39:35.574 --> 00:39:36.575]  So that's what you get from Biden.
[00:39:37.675 --> 00:39:39.156]  So it's just, it's all too perfect.
[00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:40.657]  It's all too perfect.
[00:39:40.677 --> 00:39:47.160]  They murder Ashley Babbitt, Boylan, I mean, it was like four Trump supporters died on January 6th.
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.621]  They don't say a damn thing, they celebrate it.
[00:39:48.881 --> 00:39:56.817]   They celebrate the police officer that shot an unarmed veteran, a woman, 5 January 6th, political prisoners have committed suicide.
[00:39:56.857 --> 00:39:57.797]  They don't say a damn thing.
[00:40:00.639 --> 00:40:04.061]  Gonzalo Lira gets tortured and murdered by the Ukraine regime.
[00:40:04.081 --> 00:40:06.182]  They don't say a damn thing, no press conferences, nothing.
[00:40:07.283 --> 00:40:15.328]  And now they've got the whole propaganda machine rolling out, ready to blame Putin for killing Nalvany, the day after Russian space nukes is the story?
[00:40:15.368 --> 00:40:16.248]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:40:18.209 --> 00:40:18.890]  I'm not an idiot.
[00:40:20.305 --> 00:40:23.169]  And even if Putin did have Novotny killed, I got bigger problems.
[00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:25.712]  Joe Biden is a bigger problem to me than Putin is.
[00:40:29.277 --> 00:40:33.183]  The entire Biden administration is a bigger problem to me than Putin is, and ever could be.
[00:40:34.545 --> 00:40:36.728]  And see, and see, that's the real deception.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.721]  That's the real deception.
[00:40:40.021 --> 00:40:42.782]  Putin could be the worst guy on the planet, he could be the best guy on the planet.
[00:40:43.242 --> 00:40:44.923]  It's all a distraction.
[00:40:45.343 --> 00:40:51.607]  The real criminals, the real enemies of America, the real threat to our future are in Washington D.C., in Congress.
[00:40:51.627 --> 00:40:53.148]  Their names are Chuck Schumer.
[00:40:54.248 --> 00:40:55.689]  Their names are Mitch McConnell.
[00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:59.451]  Not Vladimir Putin.
[00:41:04.333 --> 00:41:05.094]  It's all a distraction.
[00:41:05.114 --> 00:41:06.895]  The real threat are people like Fannie Willis.
[00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:08.751]  Who have motives.
[00:41:10.072 --> 00:41:11.133]  Anti-white motives.
[00:41:12.153 --> 00:41:13.514]  Anti-conservative motives.
[00:41:13.695 --> 00:41:19.319]  Yes, that's what Fannie Willis brings with her every day she goes to work as a district attorney.
[00:41:19.659 --> 00:41:20.880]  And she's not the only one.
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.083]  So this is why this Willis story, I think, is actually important.
[00:41:24.123 --> 00:41:27.285]  Because it shows you the types of people Soros is hiring.
[00:41:28.806 --> 00:41:34.311]  Not just unqualified for the job, but should be disqualified from the job.
[00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:38.631]  I mean, just listen to this embarrassment.
[00:41:38.671 --> 00:41:40.052]  Let's just go down these clips.
[00:41:40.132 --> 00:41:44.692]  Does this sound like a professional woman in clip one?
[00:41:44.692 --> 00:41:54.692]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:41:54.692 --> 00:41:58.052]  cash a few times in the course of what we're talking about.
[00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:00.132]  Let her finish her answer.
[00:42:00.292 --> 00:42:04.055]  If we would go to dinner, I wouldn't give him cash because he paid for dinner or I paid for dinner.
[00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:07.497]  I've given him cash only a few times in life, probably four.
[00:42:08.498 --> 00:42:11.260]  Probably the most money I've ever handed him is $2,500.
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.263]  The least amount of money I've handed him, probably between $500 and $1,000.
[00:42:14.103 --> 00:42:17.643]  $500 and $1,000.
[00:42:17.643 --> 00:42:20.702]  You never wrote him a check?
[00:42:20.702 --> 00:42:23.021]  Ma'am, I don't have checks.
[00:42:23.064 --> 00:42:23.785]  Okay.
[00:42:23.845 --> 00:42:27.988]  Um, so you have no proof of any reimbursement for any of these things because it was all cash, right?
[00:42:28.469 --> 00:42:31.411]  The testimony of one witness is enough to prove a fact.
[00:42:31.431 --> 00:42:32.532]  So my question was, do you have any proof?
[00:42:32.552 --> 00:42:33.533]  Are you telling me that I'm lying to you?
[00:42:33.613 --> 00:42:34.814]  Is that what you're intimating right here?
[00:42:35.595 --> 00:42:37.777]  I'm asking if you have any proof that you paid him any of these fines.
[00:42:37.797 --> 00:42:38.838]  The proof is what I just told you.
[00:42:40.179 --> 00:42:40.940]  You have no written proof.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.182]  Is that correct?
[00:42:45.864 --> 00:42:52.409]   So, I have some, um, Probably some transactions like in Belize.
[00:42:52.429 --> 00:42:56.692]  I probably spent $500 on my car in Belize.
[00:42:56.952 --> 00:43:02.415]  I spent 800, I can't remember, $900 on each of our tickets to go to Belize.
[00:43:03.696 --> 00:43:05.918]  Now, there's obvious questions here.
[00:43:08.299 --> 00:43:10.320]  Like, why are you paying Nathan Wade in cash?
[00:43:10.941 --> 00:43:14.122]  And she admits that there is no record of these payments.
[00:43:14.142 --> 00:43:14.823]  Well, how convenient.
[00:43:15.882 --> 00:43:16.803]  How convenient.
[00:43:16.943 --> 00:43:18.385]  And look, I'm not going to sit here.
[00:43:19.126 --> 00:43:25.393]  Quite frankly, I don't care about the IRS and you keeping books to please the IRS, but clearly she was not doing that.
[00:43:27.295 --> 00:43:30.278]  And now she's asked to produce records of these payments and she can't do it.
[00:43:30.318 --> 00:43:30.979]  How convenient.
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.562]  Always paying him in cash.
[00:43:36.584 --> 00:43:39.925]  Now look, again, I support Fannie Willis paying somebody in cash.
[00:43:40.145 --> 00:43:44.245]  This is why cash is important, so that the government can't spy on you in every transaction you make.
[00:43:44.525 --> 00:43:45.946]  But she clearly knew that, huh?
[00:43:48.086 --> 00:43:49.366]  She clearly knew that.
[00:43:52.307 --> 00:43:58.228]  Now, we'll see what else develops from this, because she said a bunch of other things that could be easily disproven if they were lies.
[00:44:02.268 --> 00:44:04.609]  But listen to what she says here in clip 8.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.943]  Did she just admit to a campaign finance violation here in Clip 8?
[00:44:10.845 --> 00:44:14.208]  When she took out a bunch of money from her first campaign, she kept the cash?
[00:44:14.068 --> 00:44:19.428]   some of the cash of that. Like to tell you what I just have cash in my house I
[00:44:19.428 --> 00:44:25.667]   don't have as much today. When she took out a bunch of money from her first
[00:44:25.667 --> 00:44:31.028]   campaign she kept the cash? I mean there might be an innocent explanation for
[00:44:31.028 --> 00:44:33.107]  that.
[00:44:33.107 --> 00:44:47.683]   But then again, JDV Vance was paying attention to this, and he said that he believes Fannie Willis admitted to multiple felonies during her testimony yesterday.
[00:44:48.584 --> 00:44:49.485]  Multiple felonies!
[00:44:51.526 --> 00:44:52.567]  But she's a Democrat.
[00:44:52.727 --> 00:44:53.828]  She's a strong black woman.
[00:44:53.868 --> 00:44:54.869]  She's above the law.
[00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:57.471]  She is the law, as she sees it.
[00:44:59.295 --> 00:45:01.216]  That's why she's up there so arrogantly and confidently.
[00:45:01.917 --> 00:45:03.959]  And I would not expect anything to come from this, folks.
[00:45:03.979 --> 00:45:04.919]  I'm gonna be perfectly honest.
[00:45:04.959 --> 00:45:06.601]  Don't expect anything to come from this.
[00:45:06.881 --> 00:45:10.964]  The worst that'll happen is she might get disqualified from the Trump case, but it won't change anything.
[00:45:12.285 --> 00:45:12.805]  She knows it.
[00:45:12.905 --> 00:45:14.687]  She knows that judge ain't gonna do a damn thing.
[00:45:16.988 --> 00:45:25.575]  And overall, all this really does is disqualify her as a legitimate district attorney, whether it's the Trump case or not.
[00:45:26.115 --> 00:45:26.415]  J.D.
[00:45:26.455 --> 00:45:33.966]   Vance, It's like every other two-minute clip I watch of this Fannie Willis interview, she admits to committing another felony.
[00:45:34.206 --> 00:45:34.987]  Yeah, but she'll get away with it.
[00:45:37.188 --> 00:45:43.273]  Now listen to what she says here in clip nine, which might be easily provable as a lie, and perhaps perjury.
[00:45:46.796 --> 00:45:52.541]  My next question is based on her opening the door, and therefore I'll just ask it, and Your Honor can decide whether or not it's appropriate.
[00:45:52.581 --> 00:45:54.643]  When you went to D.C., did you go to the White House?
[00:45:55.464 --> 00:45:56.605]  I did not go to the White House.
[00:45:58.575 --> 00:46:05.481]  Well now, ladies and gentlemen, this is interesting because there is a White House visitor log and Fannie's name is on it!
[00:46:07.603 --> 00:46:08.343]  Her name is on it!
[00:46:10.565 --> 00:46:12.307]  Now again, maybe there's an interesting explanation.
[00:46:12.327 --> 00:46:14.088]  There might be another Fannie Willis running around.
[00:46:15.289 --> 00:46:15.549]  Yeah.
[00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.850]  Sure.
[00:46:18.532 --> 00:46:18.972]  Sure there is.
[00:46:21.414 --> 00:46:25.598]  But the White House visitor logs might prove otherwise.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.021]  But she was so strong!
[00:46:28.802 --> 00:46:32.085]  Democrats saying she was so strong on that stand.
[00:46:32.125 --> 00:46:35.589]  Liberals saying she was so strong on that stand.
[00:46:35.749 --> 00:46:40.133]  And yet she was so weak that they didn't call her to the stand again today.
[00:46:42.355 --> 00:46:48.941]  She sounds like a very serious person talking about all the cash she was giving to her lover, Nathan Wade, here in Clip 10.
[00:46:51.485 --> 00:46:54.986]  And then he tells me how much it is, and I give him the money back.
[00:46:55.446 --> 00:46:59.307]  I don't, just like you're asking me about the money with Robin, I don't do my friends like that.
[00:46:59.768 --> 00:47:02.648]  So if you tell me it's a G, then you're gonna get a thousand dollars.
[00:47:02.929 --> 00:47:05.829]  Whatever it is, I didn't ever make him produce receipts to me.
[00:47:05.869 --> 00:47:08.110]  Whatever he told me it was, I gave him the money back.
[00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:09.391]  It's a G, baby.
[00:47:10.431 --> 00:47:20.174]  Okay, so they basically have to admit they were having an affair, a sexual affair, but that's funny because here's what she said in 2020 about not having affairs with employees in clip 12.
[00:47:21.263 --> 00:47:25.547]  Because they deserve a DA that won't have sex with his employees.
[00:47:25.947 --> 00:47:32.693]  Because they deserve a DA that won't put money in their own pocket when it should go to benefit children.
[00:47:32.973 --> 00:47:34.154]  Because we deserve better.
[00:47:34.855 --> 00:47:36.456]  She did exactly both of those things.
[00:47:37.437 --> 00:47:39.199]  And so it looks like they were...
[00:47:40.421 --> 00:48:08.103]   Taking you know their lover relationship trips who knows dating back how long they knew it was probably unethical at the least so he would pay for it on his credit card and maybe get some points back whatever so he pays for on the credit card and then she reimburses with cash at least that's their argument so there you go and but but you know she wants you to know well what do you think she means here in clip 13 I'm not going to emasculate a black man, but I'm just telling you.
[00:48:08.123 --> 00:48:08.764]  I'm sorry, what?
[00:48:09.024 --> 00:48:12.446]  I'm not going to emasculate a black man.
[00:48:12.466 --> 00:48:16.669]  Did you understand that?
[00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:19.411]  I think what you meant is you're not going to emasculate a black man.
[00:48:19.632 --> 00:48:22.774]  So that would mean you would emasculate a white man, though.
[00:48:24.135 --> 00:48:25.256]  I mean, that's all I can take from that.
[00:48:25.296 --> 00:48:29.599]  So I wonder, do you think Fannie Willis's execution of the law might favor black men?
[00:48:30.899 --> 00:48:33.320]  Hmm, maybe that's why crime is so bad in Atlanta.
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:34.320]  I don't know, maybe.
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:40.682]  I'm not perfect and I'm under a lot of stress, but if I didn't have the supplements we have and we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[00:48:41.263 --> 00:48:49.385]  And when you go to InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[00:48:49.605 --> 00:48:51.126]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[00:48:51.546 --> 00:48:52.446]  We got God on our side.
[00:48:52.826 --> 00:48:54.327]  But God needs to work through you.
[00:48:54.687 --> 00:48:58.688]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:48:58.728 --> 00:48:59.189]  And that is a 360 win.
[00:49:00.569 --> 00:49:05.810]  Nitric Boost, without me even knowing, became our number three bestseller because people loved it so much.
[00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:06.771]  They had such great effects.
[00:49:06.791 --> 00:49:13.252]  It's got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, the capillators, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[00:49:14.052 --> 00:49:15.793]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[00:49:15.813 --> 00:49:20.674]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[00:49:21.654 --> 00:49:27.736]  So I could never offer Nitric Boost because it cost us so much to make, and now we can offer it for 40% off.
[00:49:29.139 --> 00:49:34.522]  Infowarstore.com nitric boost finally back in stock 40% off out of the gates.
[00:49:35.062 --> 00:49:38.024]  Did you go to a cabin with Miss Willis ever?
[00:49:40.165 --> 00:49:40.385]  Ever?
[00:49:40.705 --> 00:49:47.705]  ever.
[00:49:47.705 --> 00:50:01.705]  [music]
[00:50:01.705 --> 00:50:02.705]  No.
[00:50:02.705 --> 00:50:03.705]  You never want to cataloze this one.
[00:50:04.318 --> 00:50:04.558]  No.
[00:50:05.139 --> 00:50:17.249]  We're now into day two of the hearing where a judge is determining whether Fannie Willis has to step down from a political prosecution of President Trump there in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:50:17.289 --> 00:50:18.470]  This is a complete meltdown.
[00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:21.293]  We've got clips for meltdowns coming up here in a moment.
[00:50:21.793 --> 00:50:23.014]  But that was on day one.
[00:50:23.495 --> 00:50:25.616]  Right now we are in day two.
[00:50:26.577 --> 00:50:39.142]  And a gentleman named Terrence Bradley that worked with Fannie Willis' boyfriend, Nathan Wade, had signed an affidavit that indeed they did have a relationship, Fannie Willis and Nathan Wade.
[00:50:39.683 --> 00:50:51.868]  Now he's had the lawyers threaten him and claims that he'll be disbarred and lose his law license if he doesn't claim all activity that he's ever had in the last, what, four, five, six, seven years.
[00:50:52.828 --> 00:51:05.961]  With Mr. Nathan Wade is now attorney-client privilege and so he can't comment on the affidavit where he's saying indeed they did have a relationship which they've now been trying to deny.
[00:51:06.482 --> 00:51:08.944]  As you know, Mr. Wade is a southern gentleman.
[00:51:09.605 --> 00:51:10.286]  Me, not so much.
[00:51:10.822 --> 00:51:14.805]  She should have stepped down a month ago, but she's so arrogant she's not.
[00:51:15.326 --> 00:51:37.203]  So the quicksand's getting deeper, and if you investigate the New York real estate judge, or you investigate the federal judges, especially in D.C., if you investigate Latisha James, or if you investigate any of these people, it is all a revolving door of special interest and kickbacks and jobs and money they're being given.
[00:51:37.824 --> 00:51:45.025]   Everything they're saying About Trump is actually what they themselves have done.
[00:51:45.746 --> 00:51:49.050]  So right now, I'm just going to air short little excerpts back to back.
[00:51:49.751 --> 00:51:51.753]  Here's Terrence Bradley.
[00:51:52.593 --> 00:51:57.173]   talking about Turning client privilege and the judge even says I'm gonna
[00:51:57.173 --> 00:52:00.472]   play the whole clip local time for us calm that that isn't the law
[00:52:00.472 --> 00:52:06.873]   That's not very client privilege and then then we'll go to one of the meltdowns of Fannie Willis. I was advised
[00:52:06.873 --> 00:52:14.472]   By the bar there were 1.6 of confidentiality Applies and that I cannot reveal
[00:52:14.472 --> 00:52:21.312]   Anything that I saw or learned and that if the court is asking me to do that
[00:52:22.233 --> 00:52:36.753]   That an immediate certificate of review should be asked [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:52:27.959 --> 00:52:33.282]  I was sitting there with my attorneys and this is what was told to us.
[00:52:33.502 --> 00:52:36.163]  We want to state that Rule 1.6 applies.
[00:52:36.563 --> 00:52:43.746]  So basically what we've got is we've got Mr. Wade being able to say what he wants about this relationship but then we're not allowed to ask questions to qualify that.
[00:52:44.827 --> 00:52:46.427]  So that's not how it works.
[00:52:46.467 --> 00:52:49.649]  They either get to admit it or they don't.
[00:52:50.804 --> 00:52:55.789]  I don't think we've actually gotten anything to that extent yet.
[00:52:56.250 --> 00:53:07.321]  I think we're still making our way through it, which is, I think he's taking the position that he's not willing to share anything Mr. Wade ever told him.
[00:53:07.661 --> 00:53:12.646]  Your office objected to us getting Delta records for flights that you may have taken with Mr. Wade.
[00:53:15.276 --> 00:53:16.677]  I object to you getting records.
[00:53:16.697 --> 00:53:19.499]  You've been intrusive into people's personal lives.
[00:53:19.519 --> 00:53:20.300]  You're confused.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.441]  You think I'm on trial.
[00:53:21.782 --> 00:53:24.804]  These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020.
[00:53:24.965 --> 00:53:27.867]  I'm not on trial, no matter how hard you try to put me on trial.
[00:53:27.887 --> 00:53:29.589]  I'm not a hostile witness.
[00:53:29.689 --> 00:53:32.271]  I very much want to be... Not so much that you're hostile, Ms.
[00:53:32.292 --> 00:53:33.993]  Wills, as an adverse witness.
[00:53:34.013 --> 00:53:35.334]  Your interests are opposed to Ms.
[00:53:35.374 --> 00:53:35.735]  Merchants.
[00:53:36.909 --> 00:53:42.453]  These merchants' entrance are contrary to democracy, Your Honor, not to mine.
[00:53:43.373 --> 00:53:45.675]  Has he ever visited you at the place you laid your head?
[00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:47.636]  So let's be clear, because you've lied in this.
[00:53:47.736 --> 00:53:49.077]  Let me tell you which one you lied in.
[00:53:49.097 --> 00:53:49.397]  Right here?
[00:53:49.417 --> 00:53:51.259]  I think you lied right here.
[00:53:51.319 --> 00:53:52.419]  No, no, no, no.
[00:53:52.519 --> 00:53:53.420]  This is the truth, Judge.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.020]  It is a lie.
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:54.561]  It is a lie.
[00:53:54.581 --> 00:53:54.681]  Ms.
[00:53:54.701 --> 00:53:55.261]  Willis?
[00:53:55.281 --> 00:53:56.362]  Mr. Stanton, I thank you.
[00:53:56.642 --> 00:53:58.023]  We're going to take five minutes.
[00:53:57.843 --> 00:54:04.843]  Mr. Saino, thank you. We're going to take five minutes.
[00:54:04.843 --> 00:54:12.602]   And there's the judge breaking because Fannie Willis was having complete meltdowns.
[00:54:12.602 --> 00:54:22.603]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:54:14.292 --> 00:54:17.754]  I mean, it's just... It's not just corruption.
[00:54:17.794 --> 00:54:20.215]  It's incompetence.
[00:54:20.435 --> 00:54:21.155]  It's embarrassing.
[00:54:21.256 --> 00:54:21.836]  It's shameful.
[00:54:22.836 --> 00:54:25.458]  This is what happens when you end meritocracy.
[00:54:25.978 --> 00:54:27.979]  Alex Jones and Lou Dobbs!
[00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:29.360]  Coming up next.
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:33.362]  Alright, we're about to be hearing from Alex Jones and Lou Dobbs.
[00:54:35.199 --> 00:54:39.921]  That's going to carry us through most of this second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:42.482 --> 00:54:45.323]  Brought to you by InfoWareStore.com.
[00:54:47.204 --> 00:54:58.728]  But, you look at this Fannie Willis thing, and it's not even that I care about Fannie Willis having romantic affairs, even if they're married or whatever.
[00:55:00.843 --> 00:55:01.743]  With Nathan Wade.
[00:55:01.763 --> 00:55:08.266]  It's not that I really care about Fannie Willis making under-the-table payments with cash because she doesn't want them on record.
[00:55:09.186 --> 00:55:10.187]  Honestly, couldn't care less.
[00:55:11.267 --> 00:55:14.408]  But it's part of the larger picture of corruption.
[00:55:14.468 --> 00:55:23.031]  It's part of the larger picture of these are the types of people that are being put in positions of power that have no respect for the law themselves.
[00:55:25.132 --> 00:55:27.473]  And they don't even have basic ethics.
[00:55:29.184 --> 00:55:31.947]  Again, her having affairs, couldn't care less.
[00:55:32.488 --> 00:55:34.810]  Her making payments under the table, couldn't care less.
[00:55:36.492 --> 00:55:42.820]  But it's the unethical behavior, it's the I'm above the law, I am the law behavior, and then obviously the racism too.
[00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:46.771]  Obviously, Fannie Willis is a racist.
[00:55:46.911 --> 00:55:48.353]  She's obviously an anti-white racist.
[00:55:48.593 --> 00:55:50.275]  Again, I don't even care if she's an anti-white racist!
[00:55:50.655 --> 00:56:00.564]  It's that she now has a position of power, a woman who doesn't belong there, with no ethics, a racist, and potentially even a felonious criminal.
[00:56:01.745 --> 00:56:02.887]  But she'll be above the law!
[00:56:05.749 --> 00:56:06.110]  Oh yes!
[00:56:08.337 --> 00:56:14.939]  I would not expect anything to happen to Fannie Willis, other than the national embarrassment and the shame that she's brought on herself.
[00:56:15.779 --> 00:56:17.200]  Can't even put a dress on straight.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.120]  Where's a dress backwards?
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:19.780]  What the hell is that?
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:26.743]  Did her and Nathan have a little beforehand and she just had to hurry up into her dress, puts it on backwards?
[00:56:27.183 --> 00:56:27.743]  What's that about?
[00:56:30.924 --> 00:56:34.985]  Or who knows, given her history, maybe some of the other lawyers had a little Fannie time.
[00:56:38.186 --> 00:56:40.007]  But it's just, it's embarrassing for our country.
[00:56:40.207 --> 00:56:49.893]  And when you have unethical, potentially even criminal, racist people running the justice system, this is why everything collapses.
[00:56:49.993 --> 00:56:51.834]  This is why America looks the way it looks.
[00:56:51.874 --> 00:56:54.315]  This is why cities like Atlanta are so violent.
[00:56:58.198 --> 00:56:59.678]  Because of people like Fannie Willis.
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:10.771]   And when you end the meritocracy, and when you replace it with diversity, This is what you get.
[00:57:12.912 --> 00:57:13.612]  This is what you get.
[00:57:16.193 --> 00:57:17.834]  I mean, folks, it's so bad.
[00:57:18.234 --> 00:57:22.116]  Even CNN is saying that this charade needs to end.
[00:57:23.016 --> 00:57:27.698]  With headlines like Fannie Willis and Nathan Wade need to step aside to save the country.
[00:57:27.738 --> 00:57:29.378]  I mean, that's how bad this is.
[00:57:29.778 --> 00:57:30.859]  But again, it's the same liberals.
[00:57:31.179 --> 00:57:32.840]  Oh, Fannie was fantastic!
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:33.960]  Oh my gosh!
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:35.280]  Oh, she's so courageous!
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:36.281]  She's so brave!
[00:57:36.741 --> 00:57:39.002]  Oh, I'm just in love with her!
[00:57:41.243 --> 00:57:45.544]  And they create these heroes out of liars, and crooks, and criminals.
[00:57:45.884 --> 00:57:51.085]  Because they know it's the propaganda they're being fed, and if they don't amplify it, and if they don't believe it, then nobody will.
[00:57:52.585 --> 00:57:55.965]  Oh, but Fannie was so great that they said, Fannie, do not go back on the stand!
[00:57:56.126 --> 00:57:57.126]  Please, for the love of God!
[00:57:58.886 --> 00:58:02.687]  Even CNN is like, you're embarrassing us, and you're destroying our case against Trump!
[00:58:04.387 --> 00:58:06.947]  Alright, now as I said, Alex Jones and Lou Dobbs coming up.
[00:58:09.288 --> 00:58:10.148]  And it's great!
[00:58:11.004 --> 00:58:12.545]  That we can make interviews like this happen.
[00:58:13.006 --> 00:58:16.189]  I'm very much looking forward to hearing from both of these individuals.
[00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:20.693]  And it's all thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:20.853 --> 00:58:24.857]  And man, it's time for me to do some shopping at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:26.438 --> 00:58:30.302]  Because this morning I was getting ready to drink my Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:58:30.342 --> 00:58:33.525]  I put a scoop of it in a glass of juice every morning.
[00:58:35.070 --> 00:58:39.235]  And I realize that I'm almost out of Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:58:40.016 --> 00:58:42.239]  So I need to go and fill my shopping cart.
[00:58:42.279 --> 00:58:43.821]  I need to get some Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:58:44.122 --> 00:58:49.448]  Over 100% daily value of Vitamin A, Vitamin B, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and so much more.
[00:58:49.488 --> 00:58:50.489]  That's why I start every day with it.
[00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:52.792]  But then I need some Turbo Force Plus too.
[00:58:53.823 --> 00:58:55.925]  I'm all out of TurboForce Plus as well.
[00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:59.108]  I need to get some BrainForce Plus so that I can have energy and focus.
[00:58:59.389 --> 00:59:04.233]  10 hours of clean energy in one scoop of TurboForce Plus from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:04.434 --> 00:59:05.375]  These are great products.
[00:59:05.935 --> 00:59:08.037]  I'm a product of the product of InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:08.077 --> 00:59:12.442]  Things you need, things you want, help you keep your immune system strong and everything else.
[00:59:14.235 --> 00:59:19.221]  So, I can tell you from experience from using these products that they're great.
[00:59:19.742 --> 00:59:28.713]  So you get a great product and you support the InfoWar, which you know the Deep State, the Democrats, all the corrupt entities that want to destroy this country want us all fair.
[00:59:28.753 --> 00:59:33.478]  But war is still here and now we got Alex Jones and Lou Dobbs.
[00:59:34.554 --> 00:59:39.318]  And now, Alex Jones, THE Alex Jones, I might add.
[00:59:40.139 --> 00:59:41.440]  Alex, it is great to see you.
[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:49.046]  It's been a long while in coming, but we're delighted to have you here and to have a chance to have a little talk.
[00:59:49.846 --> 00:59:52.008]  Your thoughts today on America.
[00:59:53.800 --> 01:00:00.162]  Well, I'm glad you raised that up front because you sent me a few questions but you didn't add that one and that's what I was going to say.
[01:00:00.603 --> 01:00:04.844]  What is it like when you had the top show in the English-speaking world?
[01:00:05.344 --> 01:00:09.906]  We're not, you know, trying to be first place here but a bigger show than Tucker had on Fox.
[01:00:10.706 --> 01:00:14.768]  You were on CNN reaching 10 million people a day, conservatively.
[01:00:16.121 --> 01:00:21.925]  Predicting 20 years ago, 18 years ago, everything that's happened.
[01:00:21.945 --> 01:00:25.588]  So our job is much easier as patriots that are anti-globalist.
[01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:29.991]  I mean, you pioneered on mainstream media, the first person to ever break all this.
[01:00:30.412 --> 01:00:41.080]  So I was going to ask you, when you ask me questions, what is it like now to now be here when Elon Musk and Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson all sound just like you did 20-something years ago?
[01:00:42.421 --> 01:00:49.166]  Well, it sounds like music to me, because I didn't hear any like voices, like minds.
[01:00:49.587 --> 01:00:51.248]  Well, I will reserve that.
[01:00:51.508 --> 01:00:54.530]  You were amazing throughout your career.
[01:00:54.570 --> 01:01:01.996]  You started as a skeptic of all that is establishment, and my hand's off to you.
[01:01:02.436 --> 01:01:03.817]  But I was out in the wilderness.
[01:01:03.897 --> 01:01:05.018]  I mean, I was out in the wilderness.
[01:01:05.979 --> 01:01:07.361]  Bushleger when I was doing it.
[01:01:07.421 --> 01:01:11.065]  You charged right on and it showed that freedom is popular.
[01:01:11.506 --> 01:01:19.396]  You have the number one show, you know, as I said, covering freedom just like all the top shows now are populous anti-globalists.
[01:01:19.436 --> 01:01:22.780]  I think that's a very positive thing about the awakening that we've reached.
[01:01:23.877 --> 01:01:25.619]  I've been a populist all along.
[01:01:25.659 --> 01:01:30.303]  I've always said, you know, populist, they say it like it's a dirty word.
[01:01:30.363 --> 01:01:32.124]  In my, in my view, it means people.
[01:01:32.605 --> 01:01:36.528]  And if you're not for the, for the people of this country, who the hell are you for?
[01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:45.015]  So if you don't call yourself a populist, I want you to say exactly what you are, what you do, because you sound like an enemy of this great Republic.
[01:01:45.536 --> 01:01:48.458]  And I've, and I felt that way from the outset, as you suggest.
[01:01:49.019 --> 01:01:50.180]  And I know this.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:51.781]  That there are enough voices.
[01:01:51.961 --> 01:01:55.264]  You were talking about Tucker and everyone out there.
[01:01:56.184 --> 01:02:04.991]  I am so delighted to have people with strong and bright, principled voices out talking about what matters to this country.
[01:02:05.652 --> 01:02:09.134]  It's a joy to me to watch it, to still be part of it.
[01:02:09.454 --> 01:02:11.736]  I'm thrilled to be still in the arena fighting.
[01:02:12.257 --> 01:02:19.102]  I may not land as many punches, but I sure do... Well, I guess I land a few, but it's harder to take them, I'll put it that way.
[01:02:20.102 --> 01:02:21.003]  Go ahead, Alex.
[01:02:22.044 --> 01:02:22.884]  Go ahead.
[01:02:23.464 --> 01:02:37.253]  No, I just know when I'm coming on with you, but I want to talk about you, because when I look at who in the last 30, 40 years has had the biggest effect against this anti-American agenda, it's Ron Paul, it's Lou Dobbs, and then kind of we all came later.
[01:02:37.273 --> 01:02:38.214]  And I'm going to take it away from Tucker.
[01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:39.014]  I'm friends with Tucker.
[01:02:39.394 --> 01:02:39.895]  Love Tucker.
[01:02:39.935 --> 01:02:40.515]  He's amazing.
[01:02:40.555 --> 01:02:43.056]  Hopefully he'll have you on his show soon.
[01:02:43.076 --> 01:02:43.537]  He should.
[01:02:43.957 --> 01:02:48.658]   But I just look back to the people that were telling me about this first.
[01:02:48.658 --> 01:02:52.579]   You know, my grandfathers, both my mother's dad and my father's dad,
[01:02:52.579 --> 01:02:58.418]   they weren't on air, but they were both aware of this because they were, you know, learned, educated men.
[01:02:58.418 --> 01:03:05.538]   So I just realized that it's like the rock in the pond, so we can see the big waves now out from the edge of it.
[01:03:05.538 --> 01:03:09.538]   But I'm just saying Lou Dobbs was one of the original big rocks thrown in the pond.
[01:03:09.675 --> 01:03:12.536]  So, you know, I don't care about Hollywood people.
[01:03:12.576 --> 01:03:14.176]  I don't care about sports people, none of that.
[01:03:14.556 --> 01:03:28.560]  But I do get a little bit giddy talking to you because I'm smart enough to look back and say if there wasn't Lou Dobbs for all those years on air, you know, the only person in mainstream media saying it, we would be in a lot of trouble today.
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:29.560]  And we're still a lot of trouble.
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:32.080]  We're in a lot better position thanks to you.
[01:03:32.161 --> 01:03:36.362]   So I know it's a little bit Little bit of me groveling here, but I'm not.
[01:03:36.762 --> 01:03:41.445]  We need to recognize the people that were, you know, trailblazers and you're a maverick brother.
[01:03:42.305 --> 01:03:49.689]  Well, thank you and I take that as high praise and coming from you, you know, I wish you were talking about being out in the bush.
[01:03:49.709 --> 01:04:01.376]   You were only in the bush because people were scared to death of you in that establishment and they were putting you back as far as they could as long as they could and you broke through and Hallelujah, brother.
[01:04:01.396 --> 01:04:17.208]  And it's like you say, it's a great gathering, these voices now, to hear them taking up the issues that matter instead of the pablum of the mainstream national corporate legacy, whatever you want to call it, Marxist media.
[01:04:18.329 --> 01:04:26.596]   People are wising up to it in a hurry, and it's wonderful to see, and the question only now is, Is it soon enough?
[01:04:27.116 --> 01:04:29.378]  Because we're sitting here 10 months away from an election.
[01:04:30.559 --> 01:04:31.480]  I truly believe it.
[01:04:31.841 --> 01:04:34.323]  You know, a lot of people say it's existential, it's all of this.
[01:04:34.844 --> 01:04:37.246]  I think it's our last best chance, period.
[01:04:37.486 --> 01:04:39.648]  And we gotta move ahead.
[01:04:40.649 --> 01:04:53.386]   I want to ask you, back in those days, if you could ever have imagined in your earliest days that this country Would have a 2000 mile long border that they turned over to the Mexican drug cartels.
[01:04:53.426 --> 01:04:54.366]  There's no middleman.
[01:04:54.827 --> 01:04:59.831]  Biden just handed it over to the cartels and the border patrol is afraid to get near it.
[01:05:00.371 --> 01:05:04.095]  The National Guard has to on their side, edge up to it.
[01:05:04.695 --> 01:05:11.401]  But no one is dealing with the reality that is the cartels controlling Mexico and our border.
[01:05:12.692 --> 01:05:18.834]  It's total Rogue Warrior, you know, back 20-something years ago when you were exposing it and the last decade on Fox Business and all that.
[01:05:19.614 --> 01:05:23.815]  It was a problem, but not because I've been down there 50 times or more like you have.
[01:05:24.376 --> 01:05:26.776]  Now it is Rogue Warrior Bazaar.
[01:05:27.316 --> 01:05:30.958]  You don't have to go looking for smugglers or kids being loaded in vans without their parents.
[01:05:31.498 --> 01:05:39.920]   You go there for even 30 minutes and you are just, I know I am, Dizzy or stunned by how insane it is.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:45.142]  And then I'm flying to the border and being groped to get there and groped to fly back.
[01:05:45.822 --> 01:05:47.923]  And it just illustrates how asinine it is.
[01:05:47.943 --> 01:05:52.904]  There's all this security at the airport, but then the border is completely wide open and the border patrol.
[01:05:54.085 --> 01:05:54.605]  So they're great.
[01:05:55.525 --> 01:06:01.991]  Irritation has been turned into a facilitator of the crime, and it just shows the social contract's broken.
[01:06:02.551 --> 01:06:11.539]  We know the NGOs that you exposed on Fox Business that got you in so much trouble is finally in the news, are paying these Democrats we see on the news to house these illegals.
[01:06:11.559 --> 01:06:13.000]  They're not doing it out of the goodness of their heart.
[01:06:13.741 --> 01:06:24.106]   It's a new business for Democrat voters to bring in new Democrat voters, but also house them for 40, 50, thousand dollars a piece a year in their house.
[01:06:24.106 --> 01:06:29.067]   So this is a business that's clouded and piven that will collapse the country.
[01:06:29.067 --> 01:06:31.027]  And that's exactly what it's designed to do.
[01:06:31.027 --> 01:06:35.465]   So that's why I have a sickening feeling, you know, I'm optimistic and see a big awakening.
[01:06:35.465 --> 01:06:38.306]  I can still, like you said, tell it's crunch time.
[01:06:38.326 --> 01:06:45.951]  You can cut the danger with a knife and really feel that America is at the crossroads right now.
[01:06:45.971 --> 01:06:53.136]  This is the most important election in modern history, probably the most important election in world history at this current point.
[01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:56.118]  As you know, elections are only a few hundred years old in the modern world.
[01:06:57.219 --> 01:07:00.421]  I guess Greece had a few little tests with it or something in ancient times.
[01:07:00.481 --> 01:07:05.625]  But it is truly amazing that we're at this point in history.
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.060]  Yeah, it is amazing.
[01:07:08.141 --> 01:07:10.882]  And we're talking with the amazing Alex Jones.
[01:07:10.922 --> 01:07:12.962]  We're going to take just a quick break.
[01:07:12.982 --> 01:07:13.903]  We're going to be right back.
[01:07:14.543 --> 01:07:21.646]  We're talking with Alex Jones about the things that matter and matters most, of course, this country, the United States of America.
[01:07:21.706 --> 01:07:24.567]  You don't hear people say United States of America a lot, do you?
[01:07:25.047 --> 01:07:27.748]  You don't even hear them talk about the United States anymore.
[01:07:27.948 --> 01:07:31.569]  They'll sort of whisper America, but they won't.
[01:07:32.330 --> 01:07:34.150]  That was my Biden impression, by the way, Alex.
[01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:37.870]   We'll be right back with The great Alex Jones.
[01:07:40.501 --> 01:07:41.102]  The year is 2030.
[01:07:41.302 --> 01:07:47.445]  The World Economic Forum's agenda unfolds, ushering in an era where AI seeks to dominate.
[01:07:47.565 --> 01:07:51.146]  In this world of steel and algorithms, there's a ray of hope for humanity.
[01:07:51.407 --> 01:07:54.028]  It's bodies from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:07:54.168 --> 01:07:59.110]  This revolutionary blend of ancient herbs and modern science stands as a symbol of resistance.
[01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:01.151]  It's not just about combating inflammation.
[01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:04.293]  It's about making your body feel invincible in the info war.
[01:08:04.413 --> 01:08:08.455]  Visit InfoWarsStore.com and order yours before the sale is terminated.
[01:08:10.247 --> 01:08:23.216]  We're back with Alex Jones, and Alex, I just want to turn to a reality that is the national capital, the nation's capital, the swamp, the open sewer, whatever people want to describe it.
[01:08:23.777 --> 01:08:26.799]  The truth is it's a land of coercion and blackmail.
[01:08:27.715 --> 01:08:29.897]  And absolute raw political force.
[01:08:30.618 --> 01:08:48.271]   An NSA whistleblower who's a guest on the show a great deal, a friend, said point blank to me the first time I talked to him that he knew there was a problem when the NSA was spying on Barack Obama in 2004.
[01:08:48.912 --> 01:08:56.597]  He knew there was a problem when Supreme Court justices were being surveilled by the NSA.
[01:08:57.838 --> 01:09:01.541]  And he became a whistleblower, and to his great cost and to his great credit.
[01:09:01.941 --> 01:09:02.922]  He's a great patriot.
[01:09:04.143 --> 01:09:07.305]  We, right now, are facing total surveillance.
[01:09:07.526 --> 01:09:13.270]  We are facing a total loss of constitutional rights because the American people are taking it.
[01:09:14.511 --> 01:09:16.312]  How much more can we take, Alex?
[01:09:16.332 --> 01:09:18.394]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:09:18.414 --> 01:09:19.855]  I mean, look at Tucker three years ago.
[01:09:20.496 --> 01:09:23.658]  He gets a call from the NSA, and you're being spied on.
[01:09:24.499 --> 01:09:25.360]  He talks about it.
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:26.160]  They don't deny it.
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:31.885]  A month later, the Washington Post goes, yeah, we've got your private messages and we've got transcripts of your phone calls.
[01:09:32.285 --> 01:09:35.148]  That is a huge felony against a journalist.
[01:09:35.668 --> 01:09:39.249]   And Nixon was removed from office for far less.
[01:09:39.249 --> 01:09:43.749]  And so there's this emboldened arrogance to all of it.
[01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:48.389]   And I don't like Obama, but he shouldn't have been spot on by the NSA.
[01:09:48.389 --> 01:09:55.509]   And then we have Trump, we know as candidate Trump, and then presidential elected Trump.
[01:09:55.509 --> 01:10:02.989]   And then I guess what's the right term, nominee Trump, and then he was the president.
[01:10:03.314 --> 01:10:11.960]  But the point is, the entire time they were spying on him, trying to find something, and they didn't find anything.
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:17.103]  When he was candidate, president-elect, or president, they had the two fake impeachments and the Russiagate.
[01:10:17.123 --> 01:10:18.825]  I remember watching congressional hearings.
[01:10:19.781 --> 01:10:20.501]  Six years ago.
[01:10:21.262 --> 01:10:23.783]  And they're just flat out, Alex Jones is a Russian agent.
[01:10:24.083 --> 01:10:27.986]  Never been to Russia, not involved with Russia, know nothing about Russia when it comes to being there.
[01:10:28.366 --> 01:10:35.430]  But they're just saying, I'm a Russian agent, all of Trump's supporters are Russian agents, because they're the globalists that are selling out the country.
[01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:40.353]  And so they need to project onto us that we're the unfaithful ones.
[01:10:40.853 --> 01:10:48.478]  And so, yeah, the general public knows it's not true, but they use that designation to spy on us, and it's totally illegal.
[01:10:49.119 --> 01:10:52.741]  And so, yeah, we're kind of already inside the tyranny.
[01:10:53.302 --> 01:10:56.384]  The question is, how high are they going to turn it up?
[01:10:57.766 --> 01:10:58.467]  You're right.
[01:10:58.727 --> 01:11:02.151]  And just where do they stop if they stop at all?
[01:11:02.751 --> 01:11:18.929]   We are right now and the national mainstream media will not acknowledge that these Marxists who control the Democrat Party, the Marxist Dems, who are the masters of this puppet President Biden, They control the entire federal government.
[01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:21.453]  This is no joke anymore.
[01:11:21.513 --> 01:11:23.916]  This is not a party that's interested in politics.
[01:11:23.957 --> 01:11:26.280]  This is a party that's interested in dominion.
[01:11:26.881 --> 01:11:30.787]  And they mean to possess power in perpetuity.
[01:11:31.708 --> 01:11:37.814]  And meanwhile, we have a fight over the Republican National Committee.
[01:11:38.375 --> 01:11:47.303]  We're having fights over electors and the stuff that's at the margin, when the reality is that government of ours is in the hands of a foreign power.
[01:11:47.783 --> 01:11:56.350]  That foreign power, I don't mean in terms of geography, I mean in terms of foreign in the sense that it is alien to everything this country stands for.
[01:11:56.410 --> 01:12:02.395]  The people who are the Marxist Dems who control that are aliens unto themselves.
[01:12:03.076 --> 01:12:10.902]  And to the rest of this country, we are looking at a desperate, desperate inflection point in our history.
[01:12:10.962 --> 01:12:16.387]  And it's whether or not we have the guts to stand up to the conflict that is surely coming.
[01:12:16.867 --> 01:12:18.168]  Will it be open conflict?
[01:12:18.248 --> 01:12:18.728]  I don't know.
[01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:20.588]  But it will be conflict.
[01:12:20.848 --> 01:12:22.029]  And there will be pain.
[01:12:22.469 --> 01:12:23.429]  And there will be loss.
[01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:25.170]  And there will be sacrifice.
[01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:27.711]  And there's no way around it.
[01:12:27.951 --> 01:12:30.051]  And people have to steel themselves to that.
[01:12:30.111 --> 01:12:34.493]  And I don't know if the American people have that in their spine right now.
[01:12:35.452 --> 01:12:38.875]  Well that's right Lou, and you always say it perfectly, I learn so much from you.
[01:12:39.515 --> 01:12:49.663]  We think of Russia or China, and they're certainly adversaries, and China's really out of control and evil and hugely wedded the Democratic Party and people like Mitch McConnell on the Republican side, so it's a huge real threat.
[01:12:50.323 --> 01:12:54.966]  But the globalists, the leftists, the Marxists, they really hate America.
[01:12:55.067 --> 01:13:01.872]  Even when they run it, they still see it because of its Christian background and because it did oppose the Soviet Union and things as the enemy.
[01:13:02.672 --> 01:13:06.856]  And they are the main threat and that they are like a foreign government.
[01:13:06.896 --> 01:13:09.058]  They are a fifth column.
[01:13:09.758 --> 01:13:12.661]  They really are an alien group to our country.
[01:13:12.761 --> 01:13:28.826]   BlackRock and the big banks and the money and the Hollywood and the whole woke thing is just a corporate A cult with all these minions literally working against the country and as big a threat as China is, I'd say it's 20% of the threat.
[01:13:29.286 --> 01:13:30.826]  And Russia's 10% of the threat.
[01:13:31.227 --> 01:13:45.751]  But then I'd say 30% of the threat is our own domestic enemies that have opened us up to Islamic invasion and to criminal invasion, that have run our dollar down, that are saying they're going to put mentally ill people in charge, flying airplanes.
[01:13:45.891 --> 01:13:52.994]   I mean, they are admittedly Trying to bring down the old structure to get control of it.
[01:13:53.334 --> 01:13:54.275]  I mentioned Clarence Piven.
[01:13:54.315 --> 01:13:55.235]  This is on steroids.
[01:13:55.796 --> 01:13:59.358]  But what's crazy is they're in the house that they're undermining.
[01:13:59.619 --> 01:14:01.640]  They're going to be destroyed by it.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.261]  So they're so ideological.
[01:14:04.062 --> 01:14:08.005]  They have such a sick ideology that they really are mentally ill.
[01:14:08.245 --> 01:14:11.507]  And I don't think they think two, three, four steps ahead.
[01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:12.188]  And I agree with you.
[01:14:12.208 --> 01:14:13.489]  I don't know.
[01:14:14.428 --> 01:14:15.729]  Because there's a big awakening happening.
[01:14:15.769 --> 01:14:19.072]  The average conservative or populist or Christian now knows, wait, we're in trouble.
[01:14:19.473 --> 01:14:26.859]  But I still don't think they knew what you knew 20 years ago, or I knew 20 years ago, of just how diabolical this is.
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:36.027]  And I just don't know if even our best people realize that we're two minutes to midnight, and that this is the crisis, not just of America, but civilization.
[01:14:36.067 --> 01:14:45.554]   Because if the globalists get full control, and they can eradicate the idea of American freedom, Then all we have is Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates' ideology of scientific tyranny.
[01:14:45.594 --> 01:15:02.601]  And so that's why they're at war with us, because even though it's the source of their power, the freedom we generated, the productivity, still it's existential to them because they want to get rid of any ember of freedom that they believe could reignite later and displace them.
[01:15:05.025 --> 01:15:06.366]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:15:06.887 --> 01:15:23.722]   And if you look at it in terms of economics, we're looking at a country in which large corporations, the tech industry itself, massive capital of valuations, $3 trillion if you're in video, you get to go
[01:15:23.722 --> 01:15:27.282]  buy Amazon, Apple.
[01:15:27.282 --> 01:15:32.442]   We're talking trillions of dollars in three, you're talking almost $10 trillion in three
[01:15:32.442 --> 01:15:33.722]  companies.
[01:15:33.722 --> 01:15:35.882]  That's unheard of.
[01:15:35.882 --> 01:15:42.801]   The idea that this country can somehow survive without being stepped on by these elephants,
[01:15:42.818 --> 01:15:45.480]  We are the dominions.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:52.084]  We are the de minimis fragments floating in space and they are the all-powerful.
[01:15:52.544 --> 01:16:04.211]  And we have to find some way in which to bring to heel the idea that this Marxist government of ours is going to be responsive to the people, to the consent of the government.
[01:16:04.611 --> 01:16:12.177]  I remember you doing business news whenever it was, 2000 or whatever, and you were covering the breakup of Microsoft.
[01:16:12.217 --> 01:16:14.239]  And it was a monopoly, and it was corrupt, and it deserved it.
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:18.242]  I look at Bill Gates' corruption, not as a business reporter, but as a layperson.
[01:16:18.683 --> 01:16:26.249]  It's nothing compared to the three big elephants that you just mentioned, Apple, and Facebook, and Amazon, and Google.
[01:16:26.269 --> 01:16:28.150]  There's four elephants in Microsoft.
[01:16:29.371 --> 01:16:30.512]  And Microsoft now is back.
[01:16:30.932 --> 01:16:32.652]  I mean, isn't the answer trust-busting?
[01:16:32.692 --> 01:16:34.893]  But there's no energy for that now.
[01:16:35.914 --> 01:16:47.918]  There's no energy unless you're Elon Musk and you are a disruptor and you do not heal to the principle narrative of these Marxist Dems.
[01:16:48.258 --> 01:16:54.441]  And then suddenly you've got the SEC, you've got the FTC and every... The EU?
[01:16:55.241 --> 01:16:56.342]  Coming right after you.
[01:16:56.822 --> 01:17:00.205]   And he'll be Hey Alex, first time caller.
[01:17:00.225 --> 01:17:06.352]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[01:17:06.212 --> 01:17:07.212]  Thanks for calling Gunther.
[01:17:07.212 --> 01:17:08.212]  Hey Alex, first time caller.
[01:17:08.212 --> 01:17:11.212]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[01:17:11.212 --> 01:17:17.212]   Just started taking that and with three pills, the recommended dose, I was bouncing off the
[01:17:17.212 --> 01:17:18.212]  walls.
[01:17:18.212 --> 01:17:23.212]   But I tell you foundational is the right name for that product because I'll cut down to
[01:17:23.212 --> 01:17:24.212]  one.
[01:17:24.212 --> 01:17:28.212]   It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[01:17:28.212 --> 01:17:30.212]   Well I'm glad you mentioned that because it's not a bad thing.
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:36.584]  Methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[01:17:36.824 --> 01:17:41.547]  So it's not a stimulant, it's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[01:17:42.007 --> 01:17:44.409]  And was I lying to you, or did it not work?
[01:17:45.089 --> 01:17:46.270]  No, it was top-notch.
[01:17:46.330 --> 01:17:49.952]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[01:17:50.012 --> 01:17:53.795]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[01:17:53.975 --> 01:17:54.895]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[01:17:54.975 --> 01:17:55.716]  It's a great product.
[01:17:56.138 --> 01:17:57.079]  Well, thank you so much.
[01:17:57.139 --> 01:17:57.459]  Yeah, no.
[01:17:57.559 --> 01:18:00.883]  Folic acid's great and it's in Real Red Pill, but some can't break it down.
[01:18:00.923 --> 01:18:01.924]  This is the breakdown of it.
[01:18:02.004 --> 01:18:02.765]  That's exactly it.
[01:18:03.406 --> 01:18:03.846]  We're back.
[01:18:03.866 --> 01:18:06.108]  We're talking with Alex Jones and, uh, Alex...
[01:18:07.265 --> 01:18:19.517]  The idea that we have a 2,000-mile border, as I said, that is wide open as long as you're paying off the cartels, because it's their property now, not America's, not Mexico.
[01:18:19.537 --> 01:18:27.084]  And by the way, the cartels also are in charge of Lopez Obrador, the president of Mexico, and everyone in his government.
[01:18:28.425 --> 01:18:46.353]  Where do we stand and how in the world is it there's not anyone in this country, it seems to me, really grasping the desperate moment that we live in and the American people seem to be just sucking air through their teeth waiting for somebody to say, you know, maybe we should be a little outraged at this.
[01:18:47.443 --> 01:18:55.689]  Well, look at the $90 million spending package to Ukraine and to Israel that they call a border package, and they think they'll pass it to the House.
[01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:56.470]  I hope they don't.
[01:18:56.890 --> 01:19:07.359]  And the American people do get that there's billions to NGOs to pay for more illegals, and it basically gives Biden the power to even open the border up more, and they see right through it.
[01:19:07.859 --> 01:19:08.960]  But they feel powerless.
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:16.386]  I mean, just like you and I, at least we have platforms to warn people, and we have Border Patrol that are whistleblowing, and we have all this happening.
[01:19:17.915 --> 01:19:29.444]  I hate to use the World War II analogy, or maybe an Eastern Europe analogy after World War II, where Stalin's tanks are rolling into your country, and it's wrong, and it's terrible, you want it to stop, but it's really happening.
[01:19:29.904 --> 01:19:36.108]  And so I think in a way, because our government's been seized, we're spectators to this, and one of the biggest hopes is...
[01:19:37.304 --> 01:19:49.112]  Trump is wildly popular and not a perfect person, none of us are, but would shut this down overnight, is just fighting with nine months left to try to get in there with all these false indictments.
[01:19:49.792 --> 01:19:59.719]  This is way better than any football game and sudden death overtime or basketball in overtime because that stuff's fun and I enjoy it myself, but it doesn't matter who wins the game at the end of the day.
[01:20:00.259 --> 01:20:01.481]  This is everything.
[01:20:01.501 --> 01:20:02.462]  This is our children.
[01:20:03.023 --> 01:20:05.186]  I've got kids old enough now to have grandchildren.
[01:20:05.206 --> 01:20:07.368]  You're a father and all the rest of it.
[01:20:07.729 --> 01:20:21.005]   And it's just to watch the establishment recklessly flush all this security and freedom down the toilet for a perceived short-term bottom line Really shows they're disconnected.
[01:20:21.025 --> 01:20:22.867]  They're not the elitist they say they are.
[01:20:22.887 --> 01:20:24.869]  They're not the aristocrats they claim.
[01:20:24.890 --> 01:20:26.351]  Because an aristocrat's not perfect.
[01:20:26.611 --> 01:20:29.675]  But if you've got a ruling class, they're supposed to hold up society.
[01:20:29.695 --> 01:20:31.857]  They're supposed to try to build stability.
[01:20:32.377 --> 01:20:39.445]  And instead, I know we've got all these lawyers and politicians and think tanks that just think they're invincible.
[01:20:39.465 --> 01:20:49.184]   You know, if you go back to a great movie made About the Deepwater Horizon that was based on the transcripts of the lawsuit and the British Petroleum criminal trial.
[01:20:49.724 --> 01:20:54.328]  And so the movie with Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell's ex on it, we've seen it.
[01:20:55.168 --> 01:20:57.790]  But it's pretty much as close as you can get to what really happened.
[01:20:58.250 --> 01:21:01.753]  And they get a call from BP's headquarters in the U.S.
[01:21:01.873 --> 01:21:02.734]  in Houston.
[01:21:03.314 --> 01:21:08.198]  And they tell the head engineer, the head of the plant, yeah, we're spending $30 million a day to drill this super deep well.
[01:21:08.579 --> 01:21:10.700]  We don't think we need to dump concrete in on the hole.
[01:21:11.401 --> 01:21:12.382]  He goes, let me do an equation.
[01:21:12.402 --> 01:21:18.527]  He comes back ten minutes later and he says, if we hit gas at any decent level, it will blow up the plant.
[01:21:19.264 --> 01:21:30.419]  They said, well, we're going to, by saving $300 million in the next couple of weeks, not putting concrete in the hole to pressurize it, we're going to leverage that and make an extra billion dollars, so we don't care.
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:31.981]  You're ordered to do it.
[01:21:32.803 --> 01:21:38.222]   And so the engineer said, We'll do a stress test and just test what you said for a few minutes.
[01:21:38.882 --> 01:21:40.963]  They did a stress test, didn't blow up, turned it off.
[01:21:41.443 --> 01:21:47.426]  Just the stress test, hours later, blew it up and killed a bunch of people and the biggest oil spill in history.
[01:21:47.706 --> 01:22:05.434]   And I don't think I know, I've talked to a lot of insiders, it's that corporate attitude of people in London and Houston telling engineers on an oil drilling platform with 40 foot thousand deep well into the biggest reserve they ever found, you don't need to follow math You just go ahead and do whatever you want.
[01:22:05.514 --> 01:22:10.156]  And I think that's the perfect allegory on an even bigger scale of where we are.
[01:22:10.456 --> 01:22:14.637]  We have reached lunatic-level bizarreness from the ruling class.
[01:22:16.137 --> 01:22:17.018]  No question about it.
[01:22:17.278 --> 01:22:24.200]  And anyone who pays attention to the stock market, for example, has to be struck by the fact that we're $34 trillion in debt.
[01:22:25.979 --> 01:22:30.362]  We've got $2 trillion in annual deficits.
[01:22:30.842 --> 01:22:34.564]  We have another almost $10 trillion in external debt.
[01:22:35.365 --> 01:22:40.928]  Then we also have the Federal Reserve with another $8 trillion on its balance sheet that has to be worked off.
[01:22:41.429 --> 01:22:55.475]   And meanwhile, you look over to CNBC or Fox Business or whomever, and you see these sell-side personality saying, you know, you got to buy, you got to be
[01:22:55.475 --> 01:22:59.794]   X, B, Y Chinese stocks by the dozens.
[01:22:59.794 --> 01:23:07.554]   They're pushing American investment and savings into the Chinese economy, which is madness
[01:23:07.554 --> 01:23:10.234]  in of itself.
[01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:12.360]  Which is, as you know, imploding.
[01:23:12.601 --> 01:23:14.802]  I'm not a business expert like you, but I watch it.
[01:23:14.822 --> 01:23:16.644]  I'm like, wait, China's imploding?
[01:23:16.984 --> 01:23:19.946]  Why am I watching CNBC and it's almost all that of China?
[01:23:20.147 --> 01:23:22.408]  Like, I'm on a rocket science loop, but am I right?
[01:23:22.448 --> 01:23:23.509]  That's really bad advice.
[01:23:23.549 --> 01:23:25.451]  I mean, this makes Kramer look like a good guy.
[01:23:27.492 --> 01:23:36.679]  Well, you know, Kramer's a good guy, but the fact is he's also a corporatist guy, and that's his world, and that's understandable, but here's the real deal.
[01:23:37.139 --> 01:23:59.779]   This is the world we all live in, and it matters where we put our money, and it matters where we invest our money, and it matters where we put our plants, because the simplest truth that is in manufacturing Is that the greatest innovation, the greatest inventions, have to be in proximity to markets and the plants that fabricate whatever the product may be.
[01:23:59.879 --> 01:24:03.182]  Whether it's a car, whether it is advanced technology.
[01:24:03.743 --> 01:24:07.807]  No, you can have the best technology ever, but if you don't have infrastructure to do it, you don't have it.
[01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:12.120]  And if you don't have it in proximity to your market, you're even dumber.
[01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:12.981]  And guess what?
[01:24:13.201 --> 01:24:15.023]  You hear that crying?
[01:24:15.343 --> 01:24:21.048]  That's all those people who invested in those global supply chains that screw up nearly every business in this country.
[01:24:21.408 --> 01:24:22.890]  We're paying a horrible price for it.
[01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:25.172]  And we're a more dependent nation as a result.
[01:24:25.552 --> 01:24:26.833]  So let me ask you, though.
[01:24:26.873 --> 01:24:27.934]  I mean, I see what's happening in China.
[01:24:27.974 --> 01:24:28.955]  It looks really bad.
[01:24:28.975 --> 01:24:31.017]  I know that'll drag us down partially.
[01:24:31.037 --> 01:24:31.817]  We're pivoting to India.
[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:37.764]  How can they be on CNBC and Bloomberg advising people to go to China?
[01:24:38.164 --> 01:24:41.347]  I'm not the big business guru like you, but that sounds like really bad advice.
[01:24:42.248 --> 01:24:45.831]  Well, it's not only, you know, it's just advice.
[01:24:46.672 --> 01:24:49.535]  And the fact is, if you're a corporatist, it's wonderful advice.
[01:24:49.955 --> 01:24:51.436]  If you're a populist, it sucks.
[01:24:51.837 --> 01:24:53.458]  I mean, let's be straightforward about it.
[01:24:53.879 --> 01:24:57.582]  It's a terrible thing for this country not to even be having the conversation.
[01:24:58.212 --> 01:25:03.834]  About building plants, as Donald Trump said when he said he's going to bring back all the outsourced jobs.
[01:25:04.314 --> 01:25:05.795]  All of the plants back to America.
[01:25:05.815 --> 01:25:08.556]  There's so many out there, it's going to take years to bring them home.
[01:25:09.016 --> 01:25:12.137]  But if we don't, we're going to pay an even heavier price.
[01:25:13.257 --> 01:25:17.438]  So let me ask you this, because I know you're interviewing me, but it's true, you're smarter than me when it comes to business.
[01:25:17.898 --> 01:25:19.899]  I'm totally confused.
[01:25:19.939 --> 01:25:21.139]  What is your dead reckoning?
[01:25:21.159 --> 01:25:24.440]  Because I'm going to air this on my show, you told me you were going to break a good, so I'm going to air it in a couple of days.
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.060]  What is your dead reckoning?
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:29.201]  Because I'm trying to tell my family, they're concerned.
[01:25:29.781 --> 01:25:31.941]  I'm pretty smart, I don't know what's going to happen financially.
[01:25:32.241 --> 01:25:40.603]  That's the one area, I'm pretty good at other predictions, but I'm like a blind bat when it comes to finance and the economy and the Federal Reserve and inflation.
[01:25:40.643 --> 01:25:43.624]   I mean, what do you, just in a summation, really think is going What's going on, Ludovs?
[01:25:44.804 --> 01:25:53.447]  Well, in summation, and you're ending this with a very good question, and the reality is no one knows the answer to it.
[01:25:53.947 --> 01:25:58.547]   because the complexity of this globalist economy that we've constructed
[01:25:58.547 --> 01:26:05.596]   of the derivatives alone are exponentially uh... greater than the physical economy and the physical
[01:26:05.596 --> 01:26:10.145]   economy uh... is right now there's a bail between a veil a curtain
[01:26:10.145 --> 01:26:18.306]   and maybe even a iron curtain between investors and savers uh... taxpayers and and working people
[01:26:18.306 --> 01:26:23.867]   and the the the financial structure that is the lifeblood of it all
[01:26:23.867 --> 01:26:28.226]   it is right now such a complicated economy for example in china
[01:26:28.226 --> 01:26:31.867]   we don't know if their g_d_p_ goes up five percent or ten percent whatever
[01:26:32.341 --> 01:26:32.941]  That's what it is.
[01:26:33.422 --> 01:26:34.782]  Because there is no clarity.
[01:26:35.163 --> 01:26:40.405]  And right now, there is no clarity on what's... They're saying there's such a black box with derivatives in China.
[01:26:41.146 --> 01:26:44.127]  That's what it looks like to me, like what's saying Bank of Fried or anybody.
[01:26:44.468 --> 01:26:45.408]  They don't even know.
[01:26:45.428 --> 01:26:48.410]  The Federal Reserve's like, oh, inflation's down.
[01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:49.050]  No, it's up.
[01:26:49.390 --> 01:26:50.651]  Oh, we're going to raise rates lower.
[01:26:50.691 --> 01:26:52.592]  To me, it looks like they don't know what they're doing.
[01:26:54.973 --> 01:26:56.094]  They know what they're doing.
[01:26:56.334 --> 01:26:58.235]  They just don't care about the consequences.
[01:26:58.716 --> 01:26:59.957]  And that's the chief difference.
[01:26:59.997 --> 01:27:02.759]  And by the way, that sounds like a political economy, doesn't it?
[01:27:02.959 --> 01:27:07.983]  Because our politicians are thinking the same way as the oligarchs and the corporatists.
[01:27:08.483 --> 01:27:13.247]  So they're matching up their investments in China and other places at the detriment of Americans.
[01:27:15.304 --> 01:27:15.944]  Often times.
[01:27:16.565 --> 01:27:17.285]  Without question.
[01:27:17.765 --> 01:27:19.326]  And certainly to their own benefit.
[01:27:19.386 --> 01:27:20.986]  But that's the beauty of capitalism.
[01:27:21.087 --> 01:27:23.207]  Raw, unfettered capitalism.
[01:27:23.247 --> 01:27:24.528]  Laissez-faire capitalism.
[01:27:24.648 --> 01:27:25.788]  Adam Smith.
[01:27:25.868 --> 01:27:31.131]  Take no responsibility for the consequences of your actions so long as they drive profits.
[01:27:31.711 --> 01:27:40.274]  A true, a true capitalist takes responsibility and understands the impact of society and to all of his stakeholders or her stakeholders.
[01:27:40.734 --> 01:27:43.075]  And that is, that was, that was America 1980-1990.
[01:27:44.696 --> 01:27:47.364]  Well, Henry Ford wasn't unleashed.
[01:27:47.825 --> 01:27:48.306]  I'm interrupting.
[01:27:48.327 --> 01:27:48.708]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:49.550]  No!
[01:27:49.891 --> 01:27:52.137]  You were saying 1980 unleashed.
[01:27:52.177 --> 01:27:52.518]  Say it again.
[01:27:53.632 --> 01:28:03.317]  Well, I'm saying to you that we had a compassionate conservatism, we had a concerned capitalism, and a responsible capitalism.
[01:28:03.497 --> 01:28:11.081]  What we're witnessing today is a mad rush to unexpected, unknown, and unpredictable consequences.
[01:28:12.002 --> 01:28:14.123]  Take, for example, the investments in China.
[01:28:14.523 --> 01:28:15.984]  That could be a black hole.
[01:28:16.084 --> 01:28:19.265]  It could also be a fountain of capital.
[01:28:19.325 --> 01:28:20.326]  We don't know the answer.
[01:28:21.006 --> 01:28:22.187]  Everyone pretends they do.
[01:28:22.847 --> 01:28:24.387]  Take our artificial intelligence.
[01:28:24.467 --> 01:28:37.052]  We don't know whether the extension of artificial intelligence is an extraordinarily efficient and utopian world for all of us in it, or whether there will be no room for us in any of what is transhumanism.
[01:28:37.092 --> 01:28:39.073]  So we're sleepwalking.
[01:28:40.253 --> 01:28:45.775]  And a world that is dominated by machines rather than something quite called a human.
[01:28:47.023 --> 01:29:02.118]  Absolutely, it's just an incredible moment to be alive and it makes my head spin because there's so many, like you said, so many variables going into it and it seems like the establishment only thinks first or second order.
[01:29:02.499 --> 01:29:04.341]  They're not thinking out further what it's going to do.
[01:29:05.865 --> 01:29:12.230]  And they also, and I've just been given a signal that this is your last question on your show.
[01:29:15.152 --> 01:29:22.918]  But the reality is that right now, this is a country with so many problems, desperate problems in terms of how we're going to live.
[01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:27.021]  And you mentioned your children and mine and grandchildren, in my case.
[01:29:28.212 --> 01:29:36.498]  You know, we have a great investment in their prospects and their future and this nation's, I think, destiny is the way I look at this country's future.
[01:29:36.538 --> 01:29:37.319]  It is a destiny.
[01:29:37.839 --> 01:29:46.846]  But only if we ourselves live up to the principles of our founders and those philosophers and patriots who made it possible.
[01:29:47.527 --> 01:29:50.912]   Alex Jones, I want to get graded on my last answer.
[01:29:51.653 --> 01:29:52.233]  I insist.
[01:29:52.253 --> 01:29:53.314]  You've been asking all the questions.
[01:29:53.334 --> 01:29:57.316]  I have to get an A. It's A through F. Well, I'm interesting.
[01:29:57.636 --> 01:29:58.917]  I'm interesting, but you're even more interesting.
[01:29:58.957 --> 01:30:02.199]  It's true, and I'm going to air this on my show, and you need to come on my show as soon as you can.
[01:30:02.539 --> 01:30:03.020]  It's been 10 years.
[01:30:04.611 --> 01:30:09.853]  Gut level, just past the business expert and journalist, talk show host and grandpa.
[01:30:10.273 --> 01:30:20.557]  When I look at my children, and they're getting old enough to get together and get married and have kids, it makes me physically sick because I love them so much, and they're the only investment that matters.
[01:30:21.017 --> 01:30:22.497]  And I just gut level looking at everything.
[01:30:22.557 --> 01:30:26.999]  Trump's not perfect, but I can just feel Trump is going to protect their future.
[01:30:27.019 --> 01:30:28.619]  Just gut level, not as intellectual.
[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:30.180]  I just want Trump.
[01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:43.893]  Because at the end of the day, we have all the math, the numbers, he's a good guy, he means well, he agrees with us on most things, but gut level, obviously better than Michelle Obama or Gavin Newsom or Biden or any of them, we need Trump.
[01:30:45.055 --> 01:30:47.897]  Gut level, do you think Trump can make it through all this and get in?
[01:30:47.917 --> 01:30:50.340]  A and B, what can we do to get him in?
[01:30:51.721 --> 01:30:53.682]  Well, the answer is he has to get in.
[01:30:54.383 --> 01:30:55.484]  He is committed to that.
[01:30:55.764 --> 01:31:02.069]  I wish that more Americans were as committed as he to his leadership and to this great nation.
[01:31:03.089 --> 01:31:08.974]  The MAGA world, all of us deplorables, America first, we're going to be there.
[01:31:09.054 --> 01:31:11.316]  But we've got to do even more than just vote for him.
[01:31:11.336 --> 01:31:12.817]  We've got to be part of our community.
[01:31:13.417 --> 01:31:25.967]  We've got to be in those precincts, and we've got to be watching, and we've got to be doing, and we've got to be telling anybody who doesn't want our eyes on them, go to hell, I'll be right here watching over our democracy.
[01:31:26.567 --> 01:31:28.269]  And you just step aside.
[01:31:28.649 --> 01:31:29.850]  That's where we have to be.
[01:31:30.650 --> 01:31:37.496]  And from there, I think we start to see excellent results if we are living our lives in our communities and taking charge of our communities.
[01:31:37.996 --> 01:31:48.987]  Rather than letting this world wash over us in terms of big questions and nonsense spewed by the propagandists that we call a government spokesman.
[01:31:53.231 --> 01:31:54.852]  Is that we're not living in boring times.
[01:31:55.352 --> 01:31:57.933]  Anybody that says I'm bored is not paying attention.
[01:31:58.333 --> 01:32:06.197]  We are in extremely dangerous, but also very opportune times of the Chinese say may live in interesting times as a double meaning.
[01:32:06.557 --> 01:32:08.378]  Lou Dobbs, thank you so much for having me on.
[01:32:08.678 --> 01:32:09.399]  Love you to death, man.
[01:32:10.539 --> 01:32:14.681]  Well, love you back and I appreciate it, Alex, and God bless you.
[01:32:17.756 --> 01:32:22.818]  Well, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones and Lou Dobbs.
[01:32:24.518 --> 01:32:30.380]  And we would encourage you to take some of your favorite clips from that interview and post them on your own accounts.
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:36.022]  A powerful combo of Alex Jones and Lou Dobbs.
[01:32:36.062 --> 01:32:39.263]  All right, we're back here live in the InfoWars World Headquarters.
[01:32:40.723 --> 01:32:43.024]  Thanks for your continued support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:43.044 --> 01:32:45.965]  We're still here on the air to bring you great interviews like that.
[01:32:48.297 --> 01:32:59.819]  I've got news I want to get to in the next hour, and maybe we'll open up the phone lines and get your response to some of this as well.
[01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:20.205]   But Tucker Carlson goes to Russia, interviews Vladimir Putin, and arguably what might be, as far as internet numbers are concerned, it is, The most viewed interview of all time.
[01:33:21.745 --> 01:33:31.107]  From a political standpoint, I believe it has close to a quarter billion views, if not surpassing a quarter billion views on X alone.
[01:33:32.088 --> 01:33:40.530]  But it's also been picked up and shared by the Kremlin's official YouTube channel, Tucker Carlson on YouTube, us at InfoWars, we had hundreds of thousands of people watching it live that night.
[01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:46.338]   So I mean, This interview maybe has been seen 500 million times if not more.
[01:33:48.339 --> 01:34:05.909]  But just having that interview is somehow treasonous and Tucker Carlson is now a traitor even though NBC interviewed Putin and Barbara Walters and Charlie Rose and CNN tried to get the interview and Putin said no I don't talk to fake news.
[01:34:06.989 --> 01:34:11.432]  But Carlson does it and now he's the bad guy and so we still need to pray for his safe return.
[01:34:13.046 --> 01:34:18.049]  There are rumors that he's going to interview Snowden and Tara Reid, but I don't know about that.
[01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:27.515]  But he has been going to Russian subways, grocery stores, doing reports from the streets, just talking about life in Russia.
[01:34:28.115 --> 01:34:32.998]  I don't think Tucker is going to be the last to do a documentary style like this.
[01:34:33.038 --> 01:34:36.280]  And his are just more kind of in the spur of the moment type of things.
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:38.841]  There are going to be actual documentaries about this coming out soon.
[01:34:41.063 --> 01:34:54.376]   And so, The mainstream media, the deep state, the military-industrial complex, they want us, that is the United States and Russia, to be at arms, to hate one another.
[01:34:55.057 --> 01:34:59.200]  They want their Cold War era approach and foreign policy still intact.
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:00.742]  They want NATO to be well-funded.
[01:35:01.242 --> 01:35:06.286]  So they have to have you hating Russia, thinking Russia's the biggest threat to you, and all the other propaganda.
[01:35:06.326 --> 01:35:08.468]  Well, maybe Putin's a bad guy, maybe Putin's a good guy.
[01:35:08.888 --> 01:35:09.849]  Russia's not my problem.
[01:35:12.932 --> 01:35:19.753]  My problem is the mainstream media that lies about everything from Russian collusion to vaccines are safe and effective, Hunter Biden's laptop.
[01:35:21.154 --> 01:35:29.055]  My problem is the number one candidate for the Republican Party who just won an election and had it stolen from him, Donald Trump, being politically persecuted in the justice system.
[01:35:29.335 --> 01:35:33.356]  My problem is the Department of Justice that politically persecutes me and throws me in jail for my speech.
[01:35:34.797 --> 01:35:38.417]  My problem is psychotics like Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell that run the Senate.
[01:35:39.378 --> 01:35:47.109]   My problem is all the corruption that exists In our justice system, like Fannie Willis that we've just seen.
[01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:49.591]  That's my problem.
[01:35:50.531 --> 01:35:52.333]  Putin, good or bad, not my problem.
[01:35:52.393 --> 01:35:55.134]  Putin did kill, didn't kill Nalvany, not my problem.
[01:35:56.635 --> 01:36:01.339]  They don't care about American journalists that Ukraine butchers and kills, like Gonzalo Lira.
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:09.664]  We barely hear a peep about the genocide going on in Gaza, but oh, now Nalvany's the biggest story, Putin's the biggest problem, that's what we need to be talking about.
[01:36:10.965 --> 01:36:12.146]  That's what we need to be concerned about.
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:33.827]  But see, here's the issue, and this is why a lot of people believe that it's nothing but propaganda, with the intelligence agencies saying Russia is about to hit us with a space nuke, to now saying Putin killed Alexei Navalny in a Russian prison.
[01:36:35.687 --> 01:36:37.868]  They're losing the narrative war on Russia.
[01:36:37.908 --> 01:36:41.449]  They're losing the narrative war and the literal war in Ukraine.
[01:36:41.889 --> 01:36:43.770]  They don't have the support of the American people.
[01:36:45.563 --> 01:36:51.665]  Now the dangerous part of this is that they now view Joe Biden as a lame duck president.
[01:36:53.546 --> 01:37:01.569]  And we talked about this a little bit yesterday and maybe we can take some calls on this, but they view Joe Biden as a lame duck president.
[01:37:02.369 --> 01:37:12.413]  Meaning, they'll commit all types of evil, not just against the American people, but in Ukraine or in the Gaza Strip or anywhere.
[01:37:13.233 --> 01:37:29.868]   They'll commit all kinds of evil With America and Joe Biden represented when these evil acts are committed and they just say, well, it doesn't matter if this hurts Joe Biden's polls.
[01:37:29.949 --> 01:37:33.490]  It doesn't matter if this hurts Joe Biden's legacy because he's a lame duck president.
[01:37:33.530 --> 01:37:36.091]  We're either not going to run him again or he can't run again.
[01:37:36.591 --> 01:37:37.672]  So that's what's dangerous.
[01:37:40.925 --> 01:38:05.351]  We have such corruption in our government and such corruption in our media, they let the Kiev-Ukraine regime kill an American journalist, Gonzalo Lira, and then they tell you, you need to be worried about Putin, he just killed Alexei Navalny, they have space nukes, they're your big enemy, we need to keep fighting them in Ukraine, we need more money, and we need more money after that, and we need even more money after that.
[01:38:06.831 --> 01:38:21.777]   And we're gonna need more money, and then they write it into this bill, And they say, not only is this bill good for this $95 billion, but also any president in the future that refuses to fund Ukraine, they're now committing treason.
[01:38:22.037 --> 01:38:29.744]  So in other words, they're setting up Trump, if he gets in, where if he cuts off the funding to NATO or Ukraine, they're going to hit him with impeachment or try to charge him for crimes.
[01:38:31.465 --> 01:38:34.328]  So, I mean, that's how corrupt our establishment is.
[01:38:34.908 --> 01:38:36.710]  That's how corrupt our government is.
[01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:46.684]  And so as they're losing the narrative war in Russia, now all of a sudden they're building this up as Putin being the bad guy and they have space nukes and everything else.
[01:38:48.805 --> 01:38:53.967]  But it couldn't be more obvious propaganda whether Putin had Nalvany killed or not.
[01:38:58.229 --> 01:38:59.370]  Because that's what it's really all about.
[01:38:59.430 --> 01:39:01.991]  It's really all about continuing to support the war forever.
[01:39:02.972 --> 01:39:08.115]  Continuing to have Russia as the boogeyman so they can continue to fund and arm NATO.
[01:39:09.135 --> 01:39:10.396]  They need that boogeyman.
[01:39:10.436 --> 01:39:12.037]  They need that perpetual enemy.
[01:39:13.518 --> 01:39:22.303]  So they have to run the propaganda as the American people are finally starting to wake up and think, well, maybe Putin is a bad guy or a good guy, but he's not my problem.
[01:39:23.083 --> 01:39:24.684]  My problem is Chuck Schumer.
[01:39:24.924 --> 01:39:26.285]  My problem is Lindsey Graham.
[01:39:26.865 --> 01:39:28.106]  My problem is Joe Biden.
[01:39:28.126 --> 01:39:29.447]  My problem is Merrick Garland.
[01:39:30.719 --> 01:39:35.759]   My problem is Fannie Willis and all the carbon copies of her across the country like Alvin Bragg.
[01:39:35.759 --> 01:39:48.557]   But then, to put the bow on top of it, Tucker Carlson goes to Russian subways,
[01:39:48.557 --> 01:39:56.798]   Russian grocery stores, and I think that this is the one that really hurts him.
[01:39:56.974 --> 01:40:03.175]  Because this is the other realization that the American people have had, and it's long overdue, and it's inevitable.
[01:40:05.076 --> 01:40:09.877]  Why is it, if I want to go downtown, you name the city.
[01:40:10.317 --> 01:40:21.679]  I mean, Austin's pretty nice overall, but you drive your car in downtown, you're going to hit 10 potholes, you're going to see 500 homeless people, you're going to see some derangement, you're going to see some decay.
[01:40:21.819 --> 01:40:25.120]  It's not as bad here, it's kind of a new and upcoming city, but now it's setting in here too.
[01:40:27.432 --> 01:40:33.293]  But I mean, you go to some of the classic major metropolitan areas, your St.
[01:40:33.333 --> 01:40:41.955]  Louis, your Chicago, your Baltimore, some of those areas, just completely in decay, completely in destruction, overwhelmed with violence.
[01:40:42.295 --> 01:40:51.617]  You had that shooting at the Kansas City Super Bowl parade, and they just say, oh, this is just some gang violence, these are just some young thug gang violence, and they won't even release the names.
[01:40:52.357 --> 01:40:57.138]  Well, yeah, you go to some parts of Kansas City, you go to the west side of Kansas City, you're up all night, you're gonna hear gunshots.
[01:40:59.508 --> 01:41:01.890]  Now you go to the grocery store, your grocery bill is doubled.
[01:41:01.930 --> 01:41:05.073]  The cost of living has risen significantly under Joe Biden.
[01:41:06.614 --> 01:41:13.399]  The subway stations falling apart smell like garbage and sewage and feces.
[01:41:15.161 --> 01:41:17.002]  You got graffiti everywhere.
[01:41:17.042 --> 01:41:23.448]  They built these two massive, were supposed to be luxury apartments in downtown Los Angeles.
[01:41:24.708 --> 01:41:31.813]  And they haven't been able to rent out a single one of them, and a major graffiti artist just tagged the entire building.
[01:41:33.574 --> 01:41:35.376]  The entire building tagged in graffiti.
[01:41:35.636 --> 01:41:36.937]  And so these are the American cities.
[01:41:37.117 --> 01:41:43.301]  But we have $95 billion for a war in Ukraine, and a war in Israel, and a war in the South China Sea every quarter.
[01:41:44.462 --> 01:41:45.643]  And so they're saying, what's going on?
[01:41:45.983 --> 01:41:50.166]  And now Tucker Carlson exposes that this is not how we have to live.
[01:41:50.186 --> 01:41:52.308]  This is not how we're meant to live.
[01:41:53.712 --> 01:41:57.333]  And love Putin, hate Putin, think he's the bad guy or the good guy.
[01:41:57.793 --> 01:41:59.474]  Russians don't live like this, folks.
[01:42:02.235 --> 01:42:04.755]  Russians don't live like this.
[01:42:05.135 --> 01:42:10.577]  These videos we're showing you of the streets of Philadelphia, or it could be San Francisco, or it could be Baltimore.
[01:42:12.177 --> 01:42:13.358]  You don't see this in Russia.
[01:42:14.078 --> 01:42:20.300]  Because their government doesn't steal all their money and give it to themselves and give it to wars, like ours does.
[01:42:21.772 --> 01:42:24.153]  Two words, Nitric Boost.

[01:43:20.126 --> 01:43:26.126]   So the economy here is so bad in the United States of America and it's all policy driven for the most part.
[01:43:26.126 --> 01:43:32.126]  High taxes, high inflation, the attack on American energy.
[01:43:32.126 --> 01:43:36.126]  It's all policy driven from the Biden administration.
[01:43:36.637 --> 01:43:39.978]  And so you can go through the news all day long and see this.
[01:43:40.578 --> 01:43:45.039]  Whether it's the stories talking about how 50% of America is living paycheck to paycheck.
[01:43:45.739 --> 01:43:50.160]  50% of America doesn't have enough money in savings for the next month of bills.
[01:43:51.861 --> 01:43:55.462]  Even the Wall Street Journal now this week saying, you're broke so skip breakfast.
[01:43:57.162 --> 01:43:58.443]  That's the state of the U.S.
[01:43:58.483 --> 01:43:59.663]  economy, and it's obvious.
[01:43:59.723 --> 01:44:05.667]  You go to the grocery store, you've probably noticed that since 2019, your grocery bill has close to doubled.
[01:44:08.108 --> 01:44:12.650]  Unless you just want to eat junk food all day, but produce, meats, that stuff has doubled.
[01:44:12.690 --> 01:44:17.473]  So here's Tucker Carlson visiting a Russian grocery store where they're not having those problems.
[01:44:18.342 --> 01:44:26.086]  So a long-standing feature, maybe the longest-standing feature of Cold War propaganda in the West, was the Soviet grocery store.
[01:44:27.307 --> 01:44:32.489]  No products, no choices, shoddily made things.
[01:44:33.610 --> 01:44:35.211]  And it wasn't actually propaganda, it was real.
[01:44:35.451 --> 01:44:37.352]  And you can look up the pictures on the internet if you want.
[01:44:37.952 --> 01:44:46.356]  So we thought it would be interesting to take a look at a contemporary, modern-day, 2024 Russian grocery store, two years into sanctions.
[01:44:47.117 --> 01:44:47.417]  Here we go.
[01:44:49.802 --> 01:44:51.485]  Alright, here we go.
[01:44:52.346 --> 01:44:58.716]  So I guess you put in 10 rubles here and you get it back when you put the cart back.
[01:45:00.138 --> 01:45:05.346]  So it's free, but there's an incentive to return it and not just bring it to your homeless encampment.
[01:45:06.497 --> 01:45:10.562]  Okay, this is the, uh, grocery cart escalator.
[01:45:11.223 --> 01:45:18.011]  This is designed, I'm figuring this out now, where the wheels don't move, they lock on the grocery cart escalator.
[01:45:18.291 --> 01:45:19.353]  Look, Ma, no hands.
[01:45:22.733 --> 01:45:24.574]  Retail placement here is a little bit different.
[01:45:24.934 --> 01:45:27.374]  It's like walking through Macy's to get to Whole Foods.
[01:45:27.794 --> 01:45:31.635]  Okay, we've gotten through the perfume section to get to the grocery store.
[01:45:31.735 --> 01:45:33.736]  So they call Tucker a Putin-apologist.
[01:45:33.836 --> 01:45:41.438]  Oh, you mean it's a Putin-apologist if you don't like American cities taken over by crime and violence and poverty, and your grocery bill doubling.
[01:45:41.538 --> 01:45:43.358]  Well, you're a Putin-apologist.
[01:45:44.479 --> 01:45:46.419]  The low-carb lifestyle has not swept Russia.
[01:45:48.039 --> 01:45:49.700]  Thank heaven, because, I mean, look at that.
[01:45:51.055 --> 01:45:51.736]  It's fresh too.
[01:45:51.776 --> 01:45:53.497]  Look at that!
[01:45:54.638 --> 01:45:56.299]  Come on!
[01:45:56.839 --> 01:45:58.721]  Unicorn and Minnie Mills.
[01:46:00.142 --> 01:46:02.904]  All right.
[01:46:03.004 --> 01:46:09.809]  Some kind of Russian wheat cookies.
[01:46:10.069 --> 01:46:13.011]  We need coffee, don't we?
[01:46:15.014 --> 01:46:20.720]  I don't know if this is sugar or flour, to be honest with you, but it looks like a staple, so we should get it.
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:22.402]  It's a very good-looking package.
[01:46:22.422 --> 01:46:23.623]  It's gotta be flour, right?
[01:46:24.444 --> 01:46:25.485]  And this is Russian wine.
[01:46:25.565 --> 01:46:36.396]  It's from Crimea, which not only has the warm-water naval base, but also is the source of most of the grapes in this part of Russia for wine.
[01:46:36.757 --> 01:46:37.558]  So it's apparently pretty good.
[01:46:42.245 --> 01:46:42.745]  Cheese puffs?
[01:46:42.845 --> 01:46:47.488]  You check out of a grocery store and you've got gum, razor blades, and candy.
[01:46:47.548 --> 01:46:49.649]  Actually, they hide the razor blades because we steal them.
[01:46:50.549 --> 01:46:52.750]  But these all seem to be Western products.
[01:46:52.970 --> 01:47:01.994]  Mars, Twix, Snickers, Milky Way, Bounty, Gillette, Paul's Cough Drops, Mentos.
[01:47:04.315 --> 01:47:07.397]  It's pretty non-sanctioned to me, but what do I know?
[01:47:08.898 --> 01:47:11.853]  I went from amused to legitimately angry.
[01:47:14.008 --> 01:47:15.549]  So we were guessing what this would cost.
[01:47:15.609 --> 01:47:17.969]  Everybody here is from the United States buys groceries.
[01:47:18.149 --> 01:47:21.910]  And we didn't pay any attention to cost as we were just putting in the cart what we would actually eat over a week.
[01:47:23.031 --> 01:47:26.172]  And we all came in around 400 bucks, about 400 bucks.
[01:47:27.712 --> 01:47:30.033]  It was $104 US here.
[01:47:30.793 --> 01:47:35.615]  And that's when you start to realize that ideology maybe doesn't matter as much as you thought.
[01:47:35.755 --> 01:47:36.595]  Corruption.
[01:47:37.435 --> 01:47:46.957]   If you take people's standard of living and you tank it through filth and crime and inflation, and they literally can't buy the groceries they want.
[01:47:46.957 --> 01:47:51.317]   At that point, maybe it matters less what you say or whether you're a good person or a bad person.
[01:47:51.317 --> 01:47:55.596]   You're wrecking people's lives in their country and that's what our leaders have done to us.
[01:47:55.596 --> 01:48:00.877]   And coming to a Russian grocery store, the heart of evil, and seeing what things cost
[01:48:00.877 --> 01:48:04.956]   and how people live, it will radicalize you against our leaders.
[01:48:04.956 --> 01:48:08.077]  That's how I feel anyway, radicalized.
[01:48:08.077 --> 01:48:10.276]  We're not making any of this up, by the way, at all.
[01:48:10.276 --> 01:48:12.677]  So you just saw it there from Tucker Carlson.
[01:48:13.116 --> 01:48:19.196]   And I think if there is anything else to say there in fairness, the US.
[01:48:19.196 --> 01:48:20.196]  The U.S.
[01:48:20.267 --> 01:48:22.528]  dollar is still pretty strong around the world.
[01:48:24.608 --> 01:48:27.409]  And it might not be as strong as it once was.
[01:48:28.530 --> 01:48:30.170]  And certainly there is an attack on the U.S.
[01:48:30.210 --> 01:48:30.550]  dollar.
[01:48:30.590 --> 01:48:31.911]  It's also coming from within.
[01:48:31.931 --> 01:48:42.486]   Well, yeah, what do you think happens when you print a bunch of money and fund all these wars and then Kill American energy and ship all of our production and manufacturing overseas?
[01:48:42.526 --> 01:48:43.807]  Yeah, that doesn't really help us either.
[01:48:43.928 --> 01:48:45.069]  That's all policy related.
[01:48:48.552 --> 01:48:52.896]  But even if you consider the exchange rate and the U.S.
[01:48:52.916 --> 01:48:59.882]  dollar being strong in Russia, I would say that that last video from Tucker Carlson tells a pretty strong story.
[01:49:01.525 --> 01:49:03.287]  About what's being done to us financially.
[01:49:03.707 --> 01:49:04.708]  And it doesn't have to be that way.
[01:49:05.029 --> 01:49:06.590]  Our grocery bills could go down.
[01:49:07.171 --> 01:49:08.973]  Our energy costs could go down.
[01:49:09.493 --> 01:49:11.415]  It's policy that's driving them up.
[01:49:13.838 --> 01:49:15.259]  It's policy that's driving them up.
[01:49:15.319 --> 01:49:17.181]  Now, the Democrats know this.
[01:49:18.342 --> 01:49:19.223]  They hate this country.
[01:49:19.243 --> 01:49:20.544]  You shouldn't be surprised by that.
[01:49:21.045 --> 01:49:24.709]  The frustration is having Americans that don't understand this.
[01:49:26.445 --> 01:49:36.191]  But they put so much hate in the heart of the average liberal that they'll walk around gladly paying high energy costs, high energy bills, high grocery bills, and just say, it's better than Trump!
[01:49:36.211 --> 01:49:38.292]  It could be a nuclear holocaust if they say it's better than Trump.
[01:49:40.813 --> 01:49:41.974]  But so, a very telling story.
[01:49:41.994 --> 01:49:46.136]  But oh, I guess that's a Putin-apologist, or that's Russian propaganda.
[01:49:46.196 --> 01:49:47.017]  No, that's just the truth.
[01:49:47.557 --> 01:49:48.958]  We get screwed by our government.
[01:49:50.737 --> 01:49:54.979]  We get policy that hurts our energy prices and then hurts our grocery bill prices.
[01:49:55.219 --> 01:49:55.879]  That's what we get.
[01:49:56.299 --> 01:49:58.400]  By the way, our food is unhealthy too, but that's another story.
[01:50:01.381 --> 01:50:05.963]  And then to just make that observation and compare and contrast with Russia, or it could be any country.
[01:50:07.704 --> 01:50:12.746]  See, that just destroys all the propaganda of Bidenomics.
[01:50:13.687 --> 01:50:21.870]   It just destroys all the propaganda that somehow Putin is this Dictator, working with oligarchs, crushing the Russian people.
[01:50:22.350 --> 01:50:23.011]  All inaccurate.
[01:50:24.591 --> 01:50:25.351]  All inaccurate.
[01:50:27.032 --> 01:50:27.932]  But it doesn't stop there.
[01:50:30.073 --> 01:50:31.873]  I'm not sure which is worse, really.
[01:50:32.093 --> 01:50:34.474]  I'd say they're both about equal, all things considered.
[01:50:38.235 --> 01:50:42.376]  Us getting crushed economically, by policy, by the Biden administration.
[01:50:44.437 --> 01:50:54.042]   But I think there's probably an equal cause To be shocked by what you see at a Moscow subway station.
[01:50:54.202 --> 01:51:02.586]  Now again, you go to any major metropolitan city in the United States of America, you're going to see the same thing.
[01:51:02.666 --> 01:51:09.909]  You're going to see poverty, you're going to see crime, you're going to see homelessness, you're going to see destruction, you're going to see decay, you're going to see infrastructure collapsing.
[01:51:09.929 --> 01:51:11.150]  It's just a fact.
[01:51:11.850 --> 01:51:12.491]  It's just a fact.
[01:51:14.318 --> 01:51:20.604]  I moved to Austin in 2016 when it was kind of at its peak, and it was really growing into a major booming metropolitan area.
[01:51:22.465 --> 01:51:29.351]  And you really didn't have all the kind of major Democrat-run city issues, let's say.
[01:51:30.252 --> 01:51:34.556]  The common sights, the common sounds of a major Democrat-run city.
[01:51:36.478 --> 01:51:40.801]  But since then now, in eight short years, I've watched it basically turn into Los Angeles.
[01:51:41.906 --> 01:51:42.166]  East.
[01:51:42.727 --> 01:51:47.571]  I've watched it turn into the same things, the same problems that I saw when I moved here from St.
[01:51:47.611 --> 01:51:47.851]  Louis.
[01:51:49.593 --> 01:51:53.376]  And it wasn't, it didn't take much time for the Democrats to fuck this city up too.
[01:51:54.557 --> 01:51:55.778]  Didn't take them much time at all.
[01:51:56.119 --> 01:51:56.679]  But they did it!
[01:51:57.360 --> 01:51:58.220]  By golly, they did it.
[01:51:59.101 --> 01:52:01.924]  And it's the same everywhere you go.
[01:52:04.775 --> 01:52:05.916]  Guys, see if you can find the video.
[01:52:06.196 --> 01:52:13.119]  Downtown Los Angeles, they just built this massive new high-end luxury apartment building.
[01:52:14.180 --> 01:52:18.402]  Right downtown, right next to the major sports venues, arenas, everything.
[01:52:20.143 --> 01:52:24.185]  Couldn't even rent out a single unit.
[01:52:25.506 --> 01:52:26.666]  Sitting there, vacant.
[01:52:27.907 --> 01:52:31.609]  So a graffiti artist tags the entire building.
[01:52:33.322 --> 01:52:36.004]  From the ground level to the top.
[01:52:36.304 --> 01:52:37.364]  Entire building tacked.
[01:52:40.906 --> 01:52:41.707]  So that's what you see.
[01:52:42.267 --> 01:52:46.029]  But that's like barely even the tip of the iceberg.
[01:52:46.530 --> 01:52:47.690]  It's the crime wave.
[01:52:48.511 --> 01:52:49.291]  It's the poverty.
[01:52:49.351 --> 01:52:50.272]  It's the homelessness.
[01:52:52.856 --> 01:52:54.917]  And it's in every major U.S.
[01:52:54.957 --> 01:52:55.197]  city.
[01:52:55.297 --> 01:52:58.478]  It's in every major Democrat-run city.
[01:52:59.018 --> 01:52:59.378]  Every.
[01:52:59.978 --> 01:53:00.438]  Single.
[01:53:01.178 --> 01:53:01.318]  One.
[01:53:01.759 --> 01:53:03.119]  The decaying infrastructure.
[01:53:03.659 --> 01:53:04.079]  Every.
[01:53:04.499 --> 01:53:04.959]  Single.
[01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:05.660]  One.
[01:53:09.301 --> 01:53:10.361]  The subway stations.
[01:53:10.741 --> 01:53:11.621]  The bus stations.
[01:53:11.781 --> 01:53:12.461]  Dangerous.
[01:53:13.382 --> 01:53:14.082]  Dangerous.
[01:53:15.442 --> 01:53:16.303]  Falling apart.
[01:53:16.763 --> 01:53:18.223]  They reek like feces.
[01:53:18.583 --> 01:53:19.924]  And raw sewage.
[01:53:20.204 --> 01:53:21.024]  And garbage.
[01:53:23.134 --> 01:53:26.637]  You have hecklers and beggars and criminals.
[01:53:27.018 --> 01:53:28.259]  It's an uncomfortable experience.
[01:53:28.679 --> 01:53:33.044]  But here was Tucker Carlson's experience riding the subway in Moscow.
[01:53:34.127 --> 01:53:39.371]  As you understand, a society is through its infrastructure, the places where people gather, the places where they go to travel.
[01:53:39.391 --> 01:53:42.533]  If you've got a lot of people in one place, it tells you a lot about the people.
[01:53:43.214 --> 01:53:47.938]  So with that in mind, we're standing in front of the Kievskaya metro station and this train station next to it.
[01:53:47.978 --> 01:53:51.600]  Now, the metro station was built by Joseph Stalin 70 years ago.
[01:53:52.421 --> 01:53:56.084]  And the question is, how's it doing now, after 70 years?
[01:53:56.844 --> 01:54:00.868]  So we went into it to take a look, and what we found shocked us.
[01:54:02.219 --> 01:54:07.903]  Now, that's not an endorsement of Stalin, who was bad, obviously, nor is it an endorsement of the current president, Vladimir Putin.
[01:54:07.923 --> 01:54:09.004]  You may not like him either.
[01:54:10.546 --> 01:54:14.609]  But it doesn't change the reality of what we saw, or, more precisely, didn't see.
[01:54:15.129 --> 01:54:15.870]  There's no graffiti.
[01:54:16.090 --> 01:54:16.710]  There's no filth.
[01:54:16.730 --> 01:54:18.171]  There are no foul smells.
[01:54:18.572 --> 01:54:23.636]  There are no bums, or drug addicts, or rapists, or people waiting to push you onto the train tracks and kill you.
[01:54:24.696 --> 01:54:24.896]  No.
[01:54:25.717 --> 01:54:27.557]  It's perfectly clean and orderly.
[01:54:28.558 --> 01:54:29.558]  And how do you explain that?
[01:54:29.798 --> 01:54:30.979]  We're not even going to guess.
[01:54:31.539 --> 01:54:32.360]  That's not our job.
[01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:34.201]  We're only going to ask the question.
[01:54:34.801 --> 01:54:43.225]  And if your response is to shout at us slogans dumber than the slogans we used to call Soviet and mock, that's not really an answer.
[01:54:44.045 --> 01:54:56.108]   How does Russia A country we're told is a gas station with nuclear weapons have a subway station that normal people use to get to work and home every single day that's nicer than anything in our country.
[01:54:57.247 --> 01:54:59.028]  We're not going to speculate.
[01:54:59.648 --> 01:55:03.971]  We're just going to raise the question and wait for someone in charge to give us an answer.
[01:55:04.291 --> 01:55:04.992]  What is the answer?
[01:55:05.772 --> 01:55:17.139]  So we'll stop the lecture and let you take a look for yourself at what the Kievskaya metro station in Moscow, Russia looks like today, February 2024, in the middle of a war.
[01:55:16.958 --> 01:55:23.958]  in the middle of a war. Here it is.
[01:55:23.958 --> 01:55:38.637]  Looks like a museum.
[01:55:38.637 --> 01:55:40.637]  [Music]
[01:55:40.694 --> 01:55:43.515]  Looks like a library.
[01:55:45.537 --> 01:55:46.957]  Just beautiful, clean.
[01:55:49.959 --> 01:55:51.260]  Very awe-inspiring.
[01:55:55.162 --> 01:55:57.243]  We could have this, but we'd rather fund wars.
[01:55:57.984 --> 01:56:01.086]  We could have this, but we'd rather fund illegal immigration.
[01:56:03.847 --> 01:56:04.888]  But Putin doesn't do that.
[01:56:06.974 --> 01:56:07.955]  So I guess he's the bad guy.
[01:56:07.975 --> 01:56:17.862]  I mean seriously, this looks like you're walking into the nicest museum in the United States of America.
[01:56:22.325 --> 01:56:25.447]  You don't see beggars, you don't see bums, you don't see drug addicts.
[01:56:26.768 --> 01:56:33.768]   They're not erasing their history, they're not destroying their own infrastructure, their own civic centers.
[01:56:33.768 --> 01:56:46.768]  So, they're going to continue with this.
[01:56:46.768 --> 01:56:50.768]   Tucker Carlson's experience in Russia, there's a lot more of that.
[01:56:51.435 --> 01:56:55.459]  But it's not that I'm sitting here like, oh my gosh, I wish I lived in Russia.
[01:56:57.140 --> 01:57:04.207]  It's that, it's understanding how we get lied to by our media, and it's understanding that we don't have to live like this.
[01:57:05.506 --> 01:57:06.747]  We don't have to live like this.
[01:57:06.967 --> 01:57:08.588]  We don't have to have decaying downtowns.
[01:57:08.628 --> 01:57:10.830]  We don't have to have destroyed infrastructure.
[01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:16.974]  We don't have to have homelessness and poverty and drug abuse and crime running rampant in our cities.
[01:57:17.334 --> 01:57:24.920]  We don't have to have the areas of importance with our infrastructure, like subway stations, falling apart.
[01:57:26.601 --> 01:57:28.362]  An uncomfortable experience.
[01:57:28.542 --> 01:57:30.343]  It doesn't have to be like this for us.
[01:57:31.306 --> 01:57:32.707]  We could be living like kings.
[01:57:33.047 --> 01:57:34.448]  We could have the nicest airports.
[01:57:34.749 --> 01:57:40.413]  We could have the nicest subways, train stations, bus stops, infrastructure.
[01:57:40.473 --> 01:57:41.614]  We could have all of it.
[01:57:42.454 --> 01:57:44.235]  We could have all of it.
[01:57:45.196 --> 01:57:49.459]  But we don't get it because our politicians are corrupt.
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:52.081]  Because we have to fund wars overseas.
[01:57:52.321 --> 01:57:53.302]  We have to fund NATO.
[01:57:53.502 --> 01:57:54.823]  We have to fund illegal immigrants.
[01:57:58.366 --> 01:58:03.089]   We have Soros attorneys That let criminals back on the streets.
[01:58:05.849 --> 01:58:10.931]  We have an economy that gives jobs to illegal immigrants or just ships entire manufacturing hubs overseas.
[01:58:13.052 --> 01:58:14.212]  So we don't get nice things.
[01:58:15.112 --> 01:58:21.334]  And then we're told and we're supposed to believe that our problem is all the way on the other side of the planet in Russia.
[01:58:24.895 --> 01:58:27.356]  And we can't even deal with the problems we have on our own streets.
[01:58:29.617 --> 01:58:44.907]   And it reminds me Of this clip from formerly Kanye West, yay, where this reporter tries to entrap him with a question as he's just out on the streets.
[01:58:46.748 --> 01:58:51.432]  Says, oh, what do you think about the Israeli and Palestinian conflict?
[01:58:52.513 --> 01:58:54.595]  And he says, you know, why are you asking me about that?
[01:58:55.476 --> 01:58:56.857]  I'm from the south side of Chicago.
[01:58:56.897 --> 01:58:58.298]  Fourteen kids were just shot there.
[01:58:58.338 --> 01:58:59.359]  Why don't you ask me about that?
[01:59:02.213 --> 01:59:03.314]  And that's everything right there.
[01:59:05.915 --> 01:59:07.076]  That's how the propaganda works.
[01:59:07.276 --> 01:59:08.497]  That's how the distraction works.
[01:59:08.877 --> 01:59:32.525]   Where you're more focused on things going on on the other side of the planet that do not affect you, should not affect you, and somehow you're more invested in these things, and yet your front porch is on fire, your back porch is on fire, and you're supposed to be concerned about A fire on the other side of the planet that really might not even be a fire.
[01:59:33.545 --> 01:59:34.085]  You don't even know.
[01:59:36.386 --> 01:59:39.086]  And then everything gets stolen from us in the process.
[01:59:41.607 --> 01:59:42.427]  But see, the gig is up.
[01:59:43.207 --> 01:59:44.567]  The American people understand it now.
[01:59:45.228 --> 01:59:45.868]  The gig is up.
[01:59:47.288 --> 01:59:50.489]  And that's why all this anti-Russian propaganda is coming out.
[01:59:51.309 --> 01:59:55.650]  That's why they have to lie to you to convince you that this war in Ukraine is so important.
[01:59:57.335 --> 02:00:08.526]  That's why you see all the bought-and-paid-for politicians and the military-industrial-complex profiteers showing you all the war propaganda from Israel, Ukraine.
[02:00:09.787 --> 02:00:12.030]  They know the gig is up, so they're desperate.
[02:00:13.471 --> 02:00:16.074]  But that desperation is also dangerous.
[02:00:17.489 --> 02:00:31.924]  That desperation now puts them in a position where they can spoil Joe Biden's presidency, spoil Joe Biden's legacy, commit all kinds of evil acts and dastardly deeds, and just say, hey, Joe Biden's a lame-duck president.
[02:00:31.944 --> 02:00:33.806]  He'll take the blame, so it's all good.
[02:00:35.668 --> 02:00:38.852]  So we've already kind of seen some false flags going on.
[02:00:40.825 --> 02:00:45.887]  And to sit here and say that, you know, a false flag where people die is minor is a little cold-hearted.
[02:00:46.648 --> 02:00:52.030]  So I really would not like to talk like that, but I mean, that's basically what's going on.
[02:00:52.050 --> 02:00:58.013]  I mean, you could talk about the stand-down on October 7th at the Israel Music Festival.
[02:00:59.674 --> 02:01:06.137]  You could talk about the stand-down of the drone that attacked the military base in Jordan.
[02:01:08.978 --> 02:01:09.719]  There will be more.
[02:01:10.694 --> 02:01:14.236]  But there might be something bad and big coming.
[02:01:14.256 --> 02:01:17.878]  Because they know they're losing the attention of the American people.
[02:01:19.419 --> 02:01:22.420]  They know they're losing in the narrative war and the propaganda war.
[02:01:23.461 --> 02:01:30.285]  And they know Americans are finally kind of waking up and blinking their eyes and shaking out of their slumber saying, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a sec, hold on.
[02:01:31.785 --> 02:01:33.086]  My city is falling apart.
[02:01:33.186 --> 02:01:34.347]  My city is dangerous.
[02:01:36.255 --> 02:01:38.237]  I can't afford my car payments.
[02:01:38.397 --> 02:01:39.798]  I can't afford my mortgage payments.
[02:01:39.938 --> 02:01:41.299]  I can't afford to buy a house.
[02:01:41.659 --> 02:01:44.261]  I can barely afford my energy bills and my grocery bills.
[02:01:44.281 --> 02:01:45.182]  Wait a second, hold on!
[02:01:47.343 --> 02:02:05.457]  And then you're going to flood this country with tens of millions of illegal immigrants, and then you're gonna pay for them and their way and everything they need, and then I'm gonna watch them come into my city and take over all of our civic centers as well.
[02:02:07.984 --> 02:02:09.025]  And I have to pay for that?
[02:02:09.045 --> 02:02:11.468]  Because that's what's going on.
[02:02:16.034 --> 02:02:22.402]  Now, speaking of... Speaking of, listen to this admission.
[02:02:23.944 --> 02:02:26.708]  Which, of course, we told you this was going to happen.
[02:02:29.025 --> 02:02:40.074]  Yeah, maybe they stall the illegal immigrants in Texas for a short period of time, or maybe they do secure the border in Texas, okay, but that's not stopping the illegal immigrants from coming in.
[02:02:40.675 --> 02:02:48.261]  So here's NBC News reporting what we accurately predicted, as always, next month's news today, when all the news about Abbott and the border was coming out.
[02:02:49.862 --> 02:02:59.170]  I sat right here in the studio and I said, yeah, maybe we stop them in Texas, maybe for a month, but they're just going to go to California and Arizona like nothing ever happened.
[02:02:59.930 --> 02:03:08.457]  And now here's NBC News reporting this from the ground exactly as we predicted in clip four.
[02:03:09.155 --> 02:03:16.760]  I was here actually very early this morning and found a group of about 60 or 70 that reflected how very global migration to the US border is today.
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:18.781]  There were people from Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil.
[02:03:19.042 --> 02:03:22.704]  There were people from Jamaica, from as far away as Mauritania in West Africa.
[02:03:23.004 --> 02:03:24.885]  Many of them, like I said, had been waiting here overnight.
[02:03:24.926 --> 02:03:26.767]  And on the other side of that fence, there's really nothing.
[02:03:27.287 --> 02:03:27.767]  It's dirt.
[02:03:27.807 --> 02:03:29.889]  There's nothing for them to do, no food, no water.
[02:03:29.929 --> 02:03:32.330]  There's, I think, a couple of porta-potties, and that's about it.
[02:03:32.591 --> 02:03:36.813]  There's also volunteers here who've been coming here for months because the numbers are going up here, right?
[02:03:37.834 --> 02:03:47.481]  The local sector chief for the San Diego sector posted online that in the first week of February, about 8,600 migrants were apprehended in this sector.
[02:03:47.501 --> 02:03:51.184]  If you look week by week, that's higher than it's been here in months.
[02:03:51.604 --> 02:04:02.092]  I should say that the numbers border-wide are still substantially lower than they were in December, but we're seeing them take up and we're seeing the traffic patterns sort of shift west to here in California and Arizona.
[02:04:03.570 --> 02:04:03.730]  Oh!
[02:04:04.630 --> 02:04:07.051]  The traffic patterns shift west.
[02:04:07.691 --> 02:04:11.532]  Now you tell me how these illegal immigrant caravans knew to do that.
[02:04:13.612 --> 02:04:15.033]  Don't you see what the story here is?
[02:04:17.293 --> 02:04:18.533]  Obviously this was predictable.
[02:04:18.593 --> 02:04:20.174]  Nothing is going to stop them from coming in.
[02:04:20.734 --> 02:04:21.634]  But what's the story here?
[02:04:22.074 --> 02:04:23.334]  They're being coached.
[02:04:25.095 --> 02:04:29.976]  This is a well-organized, well-funded, illegal immigration machine.
[02:04:31.787 --> 02:04:33.508]  Somebody's making the calls.
[02:04:34.848 --> 02:04:36.609]  Somebody's directing the traffic.
[02:04:39.710 --> 02:04:46.073]  It's the same thing that happens when 10,000 of them pour into McAllen, Texas.
[02:04:48.086 --> 02:04:53.209]  And then reporters go down there, like InfoWars, and we turn our cameras on and we film the whole thing.
[02:04:53.229 --> 02:04:53.970]  Well, then what happens?
[02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:57.212]  Well, they stop sending them to McAllen, and then they send them to Brownsville.
[02:04:57.232 --> 02:05:01.694]  Well, then the media shows up in Brownsville, so they stop sending them to Brownsville, and then they send them to El Paso.
[02:05:01.895 --> 02:05:06.557]  And then the media shows up in El Paso, and they stop sending them to El Paso, and they send them to Eagle Pass.
[02:05:06.858 --> 02:05:12.701]  And then the media shows up in Eagle Pass, and they stop sending them to Eagle Pass, and they send them to McAllen, and they send them to Rio Grande Valley.
[02:05:12.921 --> 02:05:13.502]  See how that works?
[02:05:14.502 --> 02:05:16.964]  We've documented this whole damn thing!
[02:05:19.963 --> 02:05:22.685]  Yeah, I ought to give a shout out here because I've been meaning to do this.
[02:05:24.506 --> 02:05:25.987]  And I'm guessing this is also a gift.
[02:05:26.007 --> 02:05:31.790]  I got another gift from our Border Patrol insider.
[02:05:32.190 --> 02:05:36.113]  Elias is what he goes by here to protect his identity, obviously.
[02:05:36.453 --> 02:05:39.415]  He also sent me a gift, a coffee mug and a little Border Patrol badge.
[02:05:40.575 --> 02:05:41.716]  I think he gave this to Alex.
[02:05:42.997 --> 02:05:44.518]  This medal, Border Patrol.
[02:05:46.972 --> 02:06:22.794]   Icon here with the green striped American flag and then the Bible verse Romans 13 for in the back So I want to give a big shout out and thanks to our insider Elias who's giving us a lot of information and all the other insiders that we've had as well To help us report to you the truth about what's going on at the border So big shout out to him But so that's why it was so predictable When they shut down the Texas border, at least momentarily, that we knew they would just go to Arizona and California.
[02:06:22.834 --> 02:06:26.197]  Now they're saying, oh my gosh, look, it's a record number of illegal immigrants in California.
[02:06:26.457 --> 02:06:28.779]  Look, it's a record number of illegal immigrants in Arizona.
[02:06:28.999 --> 02:06:30.900]  Well, it's just the same ones that have been coming to Texas.
[02:06:31.060 --> 02:06:32.201]  They're just sending them your way now.
[02:06:32.942 --> 02:06:39.847]  Because the NGOs and the UN and the Biden administration told them that's where you have to go now.
[02:06:42.509 --> 02:06:43.790]  The invasion is on, folks.
[02:06:43.830 --> 02:06:44.651]  It's not stopping.
[02:06:46.383 --> 02:06:47.244]  It's worse than ever.
[02:06:47.584 --> 02:06:51.426]  We're on pace for more than 3 million this year.
[02:06:51.626 --> 02:06:53.147]  We're actually on pace for 6 million.
[02:06:54.027 --> 02:06:54.688]  If you can believe that.
[02:06:55.968 --> 02:07:04.173]  The current pace for illegal immigrants entering the United States in 2024 is 6 million.
[02:07:04.653 --> 02:07:05.474]  That's the current pace.
[02:07:06.214 --> 02:07:06.614]  6 million.
[02:07:08.496 --> 02:07:10.297]  Somebody sent for me the statistic.
[02:07:12.258 --> 02:07:22.775]   I'm trying to pull that out of my head, but I believe it was It was like in 2016, there were 90 US citizens for every one illegal immigrant.
[02:07:23.796 --> 02:07:30.978]  By the end of 2024, it's going to be, there's one illegal immigrant for every 37 US citizens.
[02:07:33.419 --> 02:07:34.900]  Again, these numbers were sent to me this morning.
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:37.741]  I don't have them in front of me, but I think you get the point.
[02:07:38.621 --> 02:07:40.422]  And so this is what's going to become regular.
[02:07:41.844 --> 02:07:45.585]  is the illegal immigrant crime that is sweeping through Kansas City.
[02:07:45.825 --> 02:07:46.906]  Well, maybe Kansas City too.
[02:07:47.186 --> 02:07:54.989]  But New York City, here's the FBI and Mayor Adams talking about the crime now from these illegal immigrant gangs in clip 11.
[02:07:56.258 --> 02:07:57.239]  I'm proud of 156.
[02:07:57.479 --> 02:08:00.020]  Essentially, it's about 62 cases right now.
[02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:03.663]  Seven burros, grand losses, snatches, and robberies with phones taken.
[02:08:03.723 --> 02:08:10.687]  I'm putting out, essentially, a hit for people to go do his dirty work to grab phones and stuff.
[02:08:10.707 --> 02:08:11.828]  So, he's the big target.
[02:08:12.188 --> 02:08:13.889]  Supposed to be a lot of problems in New York City.
[02:08:14.510 --> 02:08:17.712]  And, hopefully, we'll grab him when we get some headway on this.
[02:08:17.832 --> 02:08:19.273]  First of all, thanks a lot, guys.
[02:08:19.593 --> 02:08:21.594]  Listen, you saw what happened on the video.
[02:08:23.035 --> 02:08:23.916]  You hear that number?
[02:08:23.936 --> 02:08:25.177]  162,000 illegal immigrants in New York City.
[02:08:25.197 --> 02:08:27.378]  Well, Democrats do that for policy, so what do you care?
[02:08:27.718 --> 02:08:28.139]  Oh, it will.
[02:08:28.038 --> 02:08:30.038]  Do you hear that number?
[02:08:30.038 --> 02:08:32.038]  The same thing all of our families want.
[02:08:32.038 --> 02:08:34.038]  162,000 illegal immigrants in New York City.
[02:08:34.038 --> 02:08:38.038]  Break our laws, assault our cops.
[02:08:38.038 --> 02:08:42.038]   That was not only assault on an individual, that was assault on our system.
[02:08:42.038 --> 02:08:44.038]  Well, Democrats do that for policy, so what do you care?
[02:08:44.038 --> 02:08:47.038]  Use organized methods, commit crimes.
[02:08:47.038 --> 02:08:50.038]   It just can't happen and it won't happen, not in New York City.
[02:08:50.038 --> 02:08:52.038]  It will, it will continue to happen.
[02:08:52.038 --> 02:08:54.038]  While you're in this police department.
[02:08:54.497 --> 02:08:56.959]  It's not about the migrants and asylum seekers.
[02:08:56.979 --> 02:08:58.601]  It's about those who break the law.
[02:08:58.681 --> 02:08:59.682]  No, that's exactly what it's about.
[02:08:59.702 --> 02:09:04.827]  No matter where you're from and where you came from, you break the law, you're going to feel all the weight.
[02:09:05.327 --> 02:09:08.591]  Unless you're an American criminal, then they're going to let you back out on the streets.
[02:09:08.751 --> 02:09:10.633]  Oh wait, they did that with the illegal immigrants too.
[02:09:11.654 --> 02:09:16.518]  The gun violence team along with the grand larceny team just conducted a search warrant here.
[02:09:17.757 --> 02:09:20.580]  Migrants preying on vulnerable New Yorkers in New York City.
[02:09:21.380 --> 02:09:22.141]  Patent 156.
[02:09:24.103 --> 02:09:29.848]  Over 60 victims committing crimes as robberies, grand larcenies, purse snatches.
[02:09:29.948 --> 02:09:30.329]  Guess what?
[02:09:31.129 --> 02:09:33.291]  This department, this agency is not going to tolerate that.
[02:09:33.992 --> 02:09:34.813]  We will find you.
[02:09:36.394 --> 02:09:38.856]  And the Soros District Attorney will put him right back on the street.
[02:09:38.936 --> 02:09:41.698]  Alvin Bragg will put him right back on the street.
[02:09:41.759 --> 02:09:43.700]  And then they'll get released.
[02:09:46.262 --> 02:09:50.766]  And then they get released.
[02:09:50.826 --> 02:09:52.888]  So, I mean, folks, this is only gonna get worse.
[02:09:53.208 --> 02:09:54.129]  It's gonna get so bad.
[02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:57.672]  Now it's just straight-up gangs coming in here and taking over the cities.
[02:09:57.692 --> 02:09:59.893]  I mean, it's like the Foot Clan or something.
[02:10:00.674 --> 02:10:01.515]  It's just insane.
[02:10:04.232 --> 02:10:11.477]  So, I want to take calls to the last two segments that I'm here with you, and then Jay Dyer coming up for the fourth hour.
[02:10:11.538 --> 02:10:12.498]  The number 877-789-2539.
[02:10:12.518 --> 02:10:12.899]  877-789-2539.
[02:10:13.479 --> 02:10:22.746]  If you want to respond to the Tucker Carlson pieces about life in Russia, or the U.S.
[02:10:22.766 --> 02:10:26.749]  propaganda telling you to hate Putin, and now he killed this guy, so hate him even more.
[02:10:26.769 --> 02:10:27.530]  We need more of your money.
[02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:29.211]  We need more war.
[02:10:30.731 --> 02:10:36.276]  Or if you want to talk about Fat Fanny Willis embarrassing herself so badly that they don't even put her on the stand again today.
[02:10:36.356 --> 02:10:38.958]  Maybe, I don't know, maybe she couldn't figure out how to put her dress on straight.
[02:10:40.079 --> 02:10:41.220]  Or the illegal immigrant issue.
[02:10:41.461 --> 02:10:44.303]  All these topics, fair game, when we come back.
[02:10:44.323 --> 02:10:44.363]  877-789-2539.
[02:10:46.656 --> 02:10:50.180]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[02:10:50.581 --> 02:10:57.609]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of, is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[02:10:57.789 --> 02:10:59.791]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[02:10:59.972 --> 02:11:01.013]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[02:11:01.033 --> 02:11:01.754]  He loved the idea.
[02:11:02.074 --> 02:11:05.596]  What would you call the debates and discussions about a pro-human future?
[02:11:05.616 --> 02:11:06.496]  Just Team Humanity?
[02:11:06.556 --> 02:11:07.457]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[02:11:07.597 --> 02:11:08.057]  Absolutely.
[02:11:08.357 --> 02:11:09.738]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[02:11:09.818 --> 02:11:13.240]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:20.924]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[02:11:21.204 --> 02:11:32.909]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[02:11:33.209 --> 02:11:34.530]  We're told humans are the problem.
[02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:35.550]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[02:11:35.810 --> 02:11:40.092]  We're told all this garbage, so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[02:11:40.392 --> 02:11:41.093]  We're not going to do that.
[02:11:41.353 --> 02:11:45.995]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at mfulmorestore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[02:11:47.253 --> 02:11:55.461]  Alright, Joe Biden gave a five minute press conference today talking about how you need to be really afraid of Putin and Russia and that's the worst thing happening to you.
[02:11:55.581 --> 02:12:01.967]  Not your cities falling apart, not the violent crime taking over, not the poverty or the economic distress or the wars they continue to fund.
[02:12:03.163 --> 02:12:05.004]  And so Joe Biden had a little moment.
[02:12:05.044 --> 02:12:06.425]  He had a little Joe Biden moment.
[02:12:06.965 --> 02:12:11.207]  And even though the teleprompter was right there in front of him, he struggled to read it.
[02:12:11.567 --> 02:12:16.409]  And so I think this is why they gave him the hook early during the press conference and he couldn't take any questions.
[02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:19.630]  It's another Biden moment in clip 14.
[02:12:19.830 --> 02:12:22.332]  The ally did not pay their dues.
[02:12:22.971 --> 02:12:26.971]   He encouraged Russia to quote "do whatever the hell they want."
[02:12:26.971 --> 02:12:39.971]   I guess I should clear my mind here a little bit and not say what I'm really thinking.
[02:12:40.642 --> 02:12:41.362]  Right.
[02:12:41.863 --> 02:12:42.203]  Right.
[02:12:42.643 --> 02:12:43.644]  So which one is it, Joe?
[02:12:44.264 --> 02:12:46.486]  You're too incompetent to face trial?
[02:12:47.407 --> 02:12:51.070]  Or you're a criminal that needs to face trial?
[02:12:51.310 --> 02:12:52.951]  It's one of the two, according to Robert Herr.
[02:12:54.192 --> 02:12:55.634]  And then you lied about your son again.
[02:12:55.914 --> 02:12:57.555]  It's really just a sad state of affairs.
[02:12:58.016 --> 02:12:59.937]  So again, look, you can call Putin a killer.
[02:12:59.997 --> 02:13:00.518]  Good, bad.
[02:13:01.670 --> 02:13:03.611]  I got Biden problems, bud, okay?
[02:13:04.031 --> 02:13:05.692]  I got big Biden problems.
[02:13:09.014 --> 02:13:10.995]  All right, we're going to start taking your calls now.
[02:13:11.175 --> 02:13:15.417]  Again, we can talk about Fat Fanny Willis and that embarrassment.
[02:13:15.457 --> 02:13:19.039]  We can talk about the illegal immigration issue that's going to be worse than ever in 2024.
[02:13:19.319 --> 02:13:23.121]  For the fourth straight year under Joe Biden, we're going to have a record number of illegal immigrants.
[02:13:24.352 --> 02:13:30.135]  If you want to talk about Tucker Carlson from reporting in Russia and the Nalvany narrative, we can talk about that.
[02:13:30.175 --> 02:13:32.837]  These are the discussions and we're loading up the calls right now.
[02:13:33.457 --> 02:13:35.999]  Remember, everything we do here is brought to you by you.

[02:14:51.341 --> 02:14:53.781]  Let's start with Jeff in South Carolina.
[02:14:53.841 --> 02:14:54.642]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[02:14:54.662 --> 02:14:55.102]  Go ahead.
[02:14:56.302 --> 02:14:57.542]  Hey, this is Owen.
[02:14:57.902 --> 02:14:58.162]  Yes.
[02:14:59.182 --> 02:15:00.603]  Hey, God bless you, man.
[02:15:00.803 --> 02:15:02.383]  I do appreciate everything you went through.
[02:15:02.643 --> 02:15:08.264]  Listen, I was wanting to tell you about, remember back in the last financial crisis, I guess it was Paulson came out?
[02:15:08.982 --> 02:15:15.126]  And said, uh, told Congress, you got to pass this bill to give all us money or else everything's going to collapse.
[02:15:15.466 --> 02:15:19.629]  I think that's what's going on with us giving money to, uh, Ukraine.
[02:15:19.669 --> 02:15:22.130]  Cause it's kind of like all of a sudden, oh, we need another 60 billion.
[02:15:22.150 --> 02:15:25.432]  You know, that's going to cover some other, you know, payment they got to have.
[02:15:26.213 --> 02:15:27.814]  And, uh, that's what I think is going on.
[02:15:27.854 --> 02:15:31.196]  That's why we keep seeing everything improve from both sides.
[02:15:31.276 --> 02:15:33.498]  Cause I think they're afraid of everything collapsing.
[02:15:33.538 --> 02:15:35.739]  So they're just buying, buying themselves time.
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:37.860]  And I also want to make another point.
[02:15:38.300 --> 02:15:38.880]  Are you still there?
[02:15:39.421 --> 02:15:41.221]  Yeah, I'm not sure I fully understand that.
[02:15:42.581 --> 02:15:43.741]  You can make your second point.
[02:15:44.601 --> 02:15:47.802]  Are you saying that Ukraine is collapsing and that's why they have to give them money?
[02:15:47.842 --> 02:15:48.942]  Because that's going on, too.
[02:15:49.182 --> 02:15:53.943]  I mean, they don't like to talk about how an entire generation of Ukrainian men has been killed in this war.
[02:15:54.423 --> 02:16:08.240]   No, I agree, but I... No, no, my point is Paulson, who was the... Somehow, he had something to do with the Federal Reserve, and he came and told Congress that, hey, you need to pass this bill Or else our banking system will collapse.
[02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:20.162]  And I'm just saying, instead of bringing that up again, because we're not going to go for that, they're doing this under the table, passing bills to give Ukraine money.
[02:16:20.722 --> 02:16:22.683]  I don't know if the two are connected, but it's the same argument.
[02:16:22.763 --> 02:16:26.603]  It's like, oh, if you don't pass this bill, you're going to war, like Schumer says.
[02:16:26.723 --> 02:16:29.524]  Or, oh, if you don't sign this omnibus bill, the banks collapse.
[02:16:30.804 --> 02:16:33.205]  It's like a hostage negotiation.
[02:16:33.245 --> 02:16:34.245]  It's an extortion tactic.
[02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:36.261]  Yeah, but here's the other thing.
[02:16:36.502 --> 02:16:42.888]  I had a good friend, our acquaintance, and he's a guy of color, okay?
[02:16:43.589 --> 02:16:46.913]  And he just came to me one day and said, oh, I just hate white people.
[02:16:47.473 --> 02:16:49.575]  And I told him, I said, that's just not fair.
[02:16:50.996 --> 02:16:55.399]  Us white people are trying to take down the white supremacists.
[02:16:55.599 --> 02:16:57.020]  We are not the supremacists.
[02:16:57.060 --> 02:17:03.685]  The white supremacists are all the people that you can show on the chart and that's head of this and head of that and they're all white.
[02:17:03.745 --> 02:17:05.066]  So we need to agree to that.
[02:17:05.647 --> 02:17:11.371]  So we need to change the narrative that instead of globalists say they are the white supremacists.
[02:17:11.951 --> 02:17:33.264]   So in fact, Joe Biden isn't lying when he says white supremacists are the problem because You know, this is an interesting discussion, and I actually went on a live show with Hotep Jesus yesterday to talk about this.
[02:17:33.304 --> 02:17:37.348]  You know, kind of tongue-in-cheek joking, like, I represent the white people, he represented the black people.
[02:17:38.503 --> 02:17:45.830]  Um, but, and I was doing this and people are sending me all these crime statistics and all this other stuff and he's like, why didn't you bring this up?
[02:17:45.870 --> 02:17:46.751]  Why didn't you bring this up?
[02:17:47.051 --> 02:17:50.094]  I mean, yeah, you can point to these statistics all day long.
[02:17:50.394 --> 02:17:57.140]  You know, I brought up some of it, but you, you, you said something that actually he admitted to me and I thank you for the call, Jeff.
[02:17:57.160 --> 02:18:00.623]  He said, yeah, I, I was, I used to hate white people.
[02:18:00.723 --> 02:18:03.346]  I was basically trained by propaganda to hate white people.
[02:18:04.810 --> 02:18:15.638]  And then his counterpoint to me saying, well look, there's an undeniable pattern of behavior here when it comes to black crime, and when it comes to black on white crime, and specifically when it comes to children, white children in schools.
[02:18:16.039 --> 02:18:22.744]  And he said, but don't you see how that's now being propaganda used to make white people hate black people?
[02:18:23.364 --> 02:18:30.030]  And I mean, maybe it's a fair counterpoint, but it's just like, how do you even, what do you do?
[02:18:30.530 --> 02:18:40.494]   What do you do To stop the flow of hatred, that obviously the divide and conquer tactics are being used against us right now.
[02:18:41.055 --> 02:18:49.797]  There's issues to address, but then if you address them, you're adding to the hatred, and so... I don't know.
[02:18:49.877 --> 02:18:51.918]  But he brought that other point up too, he said, well, you know...
[02:18:53.652 --> 02:18:59.595]  You can talk about black kids beating white teachers and white students, but look at the people that run the country like Joe Biden and them.
[02:18:59.615 --> 02:19:00.476]  They're the real white supremacists.
[02:19:00.496 --> 02:19:03.257]  They're like, yeah, I come on air all day and bash Joe Biden.
[02:19:04.938 --> 02:19:06.319]  So it's very complex.
[02:19:06.719 --> 02:19:16.645]  The solution is focusing on the issues that are the economic issues, your energy bills going up, your grocery bills going up, why Russia has nicer subways than the United States of America.
[02:19:17.955 --> 02:19:19.955]  And just building a country that everybody can thrive in.
[02:19:19.975 --> 02:19:21.536]  But now they're just giving it to illegal immigrants.
[02:19:21.816 --> 02:19:23.656]  Alright, let's go to Sergio in California.
[02:19:23.696 --> 02:19:24.616]  Sergio, you're on the air.
[02:19:24.636 --> 02:19:26.977]  Hey, good morning.
[02:19:27.897 --> 02:19:28.177]  Howdy.
[02:19:29.977 --> 02:19:31.877]  First, I wanted to plug in that nitric boost, man.
[02:19:31.897 --> 02:19:33.478]  It really makes me feel like a teenager.
[02:19:34.538 --> 02:19:35.418]  It gets your blood flowing.
[02:19:35.518 --> 02:19:36.158]  Gets your stamina.
[02:19:37.058 --> 02:19:38.498]  Yeah.
[02:19:38.919 --> 02:19:40.359]  My topic was immigration, man.
[02:19:40.399 --> 02:19:43.959]  I was just, I'm looking at all the people coming in and it's a damn shame.
[02:19:43.999 --> 02:19:50.671]   Like, my parents used to pride themselves on not Well look, if you come into this country legally, then you're an immigrant.
[02:19:50.691 --> 02:19:51.812]  If you don't, you're a criminal.
[02:19:51.631 --> 02:19:57.550]   from the government and these people come and they take whatever they can.
[02:19:57.550 --> 02:20:02.191]   And it's almost like the government divides them with the other immigrants that are trying
[02:20:02.191 --> 02:20:07.550]   to walk a straight path and try to make a living for themselves, you know?
[02:20:07.550 --> 02:20:11.871]   Well, look, if you come into this country legally, then you're an immigrant.
[02:20:11.871 --> 02:20:13.771]  If you don't, you're a criminal.
[02:20:13.771 --> 02:20:16.310]  Right.
[02:20:16.310 --> 02:20:24.271]   All I'm saying is that there's people that have come exactly with work visas and they do it the right way.
[02:20:24.964 --> 02:20:26.324]  They pay their taxes.
[02:20:26.744 --> 02:20:27.925]  They wait for the nationality.
[02:20:27.985 --> 02:20:29.925]  I got family... Sure, they come with prospects.
[02:20:30.125 --> 02:20:32.006]  They have something to add to our civilization.
[02:20:32.826 --> 02:20:34.027]  But you know, the other thing you said is so...
[02:20:35.054 --> 02:20:35.694]  Important as well.
[02:20:35.734 --> 02:20:40.316]  You said there used to be this matter of pride, where you don't want to take a government handout.
[02:20:40.716 --> 02:20:43.917]  But now these individuals that come in, it's not that they just don't look at it like that.
[02:20:44.037 --> 02:20:44.977]  It's the exact opposite.
[02:20:45.057 --> 02:20:46.818]  They look at us like we're suckers.
[02:20:47.558 --> 02:20:52.960]  They look at us like we're morons, that we let them into the country and then give them everything for free.
[02:20:53.760 --> 02:20:55.301]  So they just look at it like, oh hell yeah!
[02:20:55.902 --> 02:20:57.002]  It's like a cheat code for them.
[02:20:57.022 --> 02:21:00.265]  Like, oh I can go here and just get everything for free and these dumbass Americans will do it?
[02:21:00.445 --> 02:21:00.825]  Sweet!
[02:21:01.225 --> 02:21:02.666]  And I can rob them on the streets?
[02:21:03.047 --> 02:21:04.307]  And I can take over their rec centers?
[02:21:04.468 --> 02:21:04.808]  Awesome!
[02:21:04.828 --> 02:21:16.236]  Alright, we're taking your calls on the border, illegal immigration issue, we've got the corrupt DA Fannie Willis exposing herself, going after Trump.
[02:21:18.660 --> 02:21:24.645]  We've got the issue with Russia and Tucker Carlson going over there and exposing how their cities are nicer than ours.
[02:21:24.685 --> 02:21:25.325]  Well, why is that?
[02:21:25.365 --> 02:21:32.791]  Well, I guess that's because their government isn't filled with psychotic warmonger freaks, even though that's what they would have you believe.
[02:21:35.874 --> 02:21:45.162]  I mean, even if you wanted to claim Russia or Putin were warmongers, compared to the United States leadership, barely even on the radar.
[02:21:46.189 --> 02:21:51.046]  Let's go back to the phone calls and we go to Matt in California.
[02:21:51.086 --> 02:21:51.989]  Matt, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:21:53.383 --> 02:22:00.386]  Hey Owen, hey this is also, I just want to tell you, Wars of the Info on X and I've been doing all those drawings of you guys.
[02:22:00.406 --> 02:22:04.387]  I don't know if you've seen it, but I've been trying to draw cartoons of you guys for fun.
[02:22:04.967 --> 02:22:11.350]  But uh, yeah dude, like Fannie Willis, I mean, I just, and then will she even go down at all?
[02:22:11.470 --> 02:22:12.991]  I wouldn't get your hopes up.
[02:22:13.011 --> 02:22:13.691]  That's what I mean.
[02:22:17.362 --> 02:22:20.084]  One after another, we see another person pop up.
[02:22:20.665 --> 02:22:26.089]  But in the court of public opinion, which is not completely worthless, then she's been completely destroyed.
[02:22:27.150 --> 02:22:42.702]  Yeah, and I just want to know what you think about the upcoming election, of course, and how will we know that there will be some kind of law protected, just like it was last time?
[02:22:42.722 --> 02:22:51.697]   I think it's just, it's so sad that I think the same thing Will happen, like all the powers that be, all the world powers against Trump, you know that?
[02:22:54.713 --> 02:22:55.053]  I don't know.
[02:22:55.293 --> 02:23:00.356]  I mean, I have the same mindset as you, brother.
[02:23:00.476 --> 02:23:02.677]  It's just, you know, I get it.
[02:23:02.877 --> 02:23:03.157]  I get it.
[02:23:03.197 --> 02:23:04.377]  They stole the 2020 election.
[02:23:04.397 --> 02:23:05.498]  They steal midterm elections.
[02:23:05.518 --> 02:23:06.738]  They steal elections left and right.
[02:23:07.078 --> 02:23:07.339]  I know.
[02:23:07.619 --> 02:23:07.959]  Yeah.
[02:23:08.279 --> 02:23:11.580]  And then you see the, like all the videos where they expose it all.
[02:23:11.600 --> 02:23:13.841]  Then there's nothing investigated after that.
[02:23:13.861 --> 02:23:15.662]  I mean, I got stories right here.
[02:23:15.682 --> 02:23:16.963]  I got stories right here on this issue.
[02:23:18.932 --> 02:23:21.793]  Atlantic City ballot stuffer reportedly worked for the Feds.
[02:23:22.113 --> 02:23:26.036]  Does the FBI have ballot stuffers on the payroll in every major Democrat city?
[02:23:26.056 --> 02:23:27.136]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:23:28.037 --> 02:23:39.243]  FOIA documents reveal secret 2020 Election Day meeting with CISA, Dominion, ES&S, AIRC voting system, FBI, leftist organization, states officials, and others just discovered.
[02:23:39.583 --> 02:23:43.586]  So they're all meeting about how they can help our elections.
[02:23:44.586 --> 02:23:46.226]  So, yeah, believe me, I get it.
[02:23:46.546 --> 02:23:47.487]  I get the frustration.
[02:23:49.727 --> 02:23:58.329]  I guess we hope we can overwhelm the voter fraud with real votes.
[02:23:58.849 --> 02:24:00.369]  I mean, I don't know how else to respond.
[02:24:00.389 --> 02:24:04.190]  Look, I don't want to spend too much time on this, Matt, but thank you for the call.
[02:24:04.530 --> 02:24:05.050]  Here's what happens.
[02:24:06.431 --> 02:24:11.992]  In the major Democrat cities, let's just take one example, Pennsylvania.
[02:24:13.643 --> 02:24:16.766]  Where Trump won, I would say, in 2016.
[02:24:17.266 --> 02:24:18.568]  He was winning all day long.
[02:24:18.648 --> 02:24:19.468]  And then what happens?
[02:24:22.571 --> 02:24:30.519]  At 3.30 in the morning in Philadelphia, 350,000 ballots magically arrive, all for Joe Biden.
[02:24:30.839 --> 02:24:35.524]  And that's just the perfect number he needed to beat Donald Trump in Pennsylvania.
[02:24:36.204 --> 02:24:38.827]  And then he gets them, and then they say Joe Biden won.
[02:24:41.024 --> 02:24:44.267]  So, it's all concentrated in the major cities.
[02:24:45.788 --> 02:24:48.830]  That's where the voter fraud and the crimes are concentrated.
[02:24:49.391 --> 02:24:51.913]  So, I mean, maybe you can focus on that and stop it.
[02:24:51.993 --> 02:24:56.156]  Maybe you can overwhelm it with the rural vote, but that's what goes on.
[02:24:56.196 --> 02:24:57.938]  Let's go to Happy in Pennsylvania.
[02:24:58.018 --> 02:24:59.019]  We speak of Pennsylvania.
[02:24:59.039 --> 02:25:00.560]  Now, Happy joins us from Pennsylvania.
[02:25:00.580 --> 02:25:00.940]  Go ahead.
[02:25:01.901 --> 02:25:02.641]  Yo, bro, what's good?
[02:25:02.661 --> 02:25:06.024]  It's actually Happy, not Happy, but I am happy.
[02:25:07.786 --> 02:25:12.506]   But, yeah, I mean, I live in Philadelphia and I I mean, you see it all the time.
[02:25:13.847 --> 02:25:14.968]  It's just so obvious.
[02:25:15.068 --> 02:25:27.197]  And now you have all this propaganda coming out, threatening us into supporting this Ukraine bill, saying there's an imminent Russian threat in space.
[02:25:27.317 --> 02:25:29.118]  I mean, it's just so absurd.
[02:25:29.979 --> 02:25:33.141]  And I just don't know how regular people just don't see that.
[02:25:33.181 --> 02:25:36.684]  It's just such an obvious land grab scheme.
[02:25:36.824 --> 02:25:40.867]  I mean, Ukraine's the poorest country in Europe.
[02:25:41.247 --> 02:25:46.247]   Yet, it has the richest farmland in Europe, if not some of the richest farmland in the
[02:25:46.247 --> 02:25:47.807]  world.
[02:25:47.807 --> 02:25:53.926]   And you have these big firms like BlackRock, who are going to go in afterwards and just
[02:25:53.926 --> 02:25:55.247]  take up all this land.
[02:25:55.247 --> 02:25:56.967]  I mean, you see it all over.
[02:25:56.967 --> 02:25:59.528]  You see what's going on in Maui right now.
[02:25:59.528 --> 02:26:00.528]  It's just...
[02:26:00.528 --> 02:26:07.007]   Yeah, I would say that the simplest way to put it is that Israel is a client state of
[02:26:07.007 --> 02:26:08.887]  the United States of America.
[02:26:08.887 --> 02:26:14.326]   So the military industrial complex thrives because of Israel's situation in the Middle
[02:26:14.326 --> 02:26:19.646]   East and all the individuals in Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia that have the...
[02:26:20.595 --> 02:26:26.521]  The stocks in the weapons manufacturers, they all thrive because Israel helps us keep war going.
[02:26:27.342 --> 02:26:36.270]  And then Ukraine is like a vessel state of the United States of America where basically we can just launder money, launder weapons, launder political information.
[02:26:36.890 --> 02:26:42.450]   and all kinds of stuff through Ukraine, and then kind of keep it as this high point of tension
[02:26:42.450 --> 02:26:46.329]   between Russia and Europe, so that they can continue to have the excuse to have NATO
[02:26:46.329 --> 02:26:47.970]  and all the money that goes into that.
[02:26:47.970 --> 02:26:51.931]  And what is the final result of all these equations?
[02:26:51.931 --> 02:26:58.930]   The US people get our money stolen from us, our blood, our treasure, all poured into these things
[02:26:58.930 --> 02:27:01.090]  that really don't benefit us at all.
[02:27:01.090 --> 02:27:10.091]   Explain to me how Israel, one of the highest GDP per capita in the world,
[02:27:10.091 --> 02:27:12.649]  need say no terms, you know, of...
[02:27:12.828 --> 02:27:19.551]  Not even a loan, just give them money for this war that's clearly been set up.
[02:27:19.852 --> 02:27:20.872]  Because they own our ass.
[02:27:21.012 --> 02:27:23.053]  Because they own our ass.
[02:27:23.393 --> 02:27:24.134]  Pull it up right now.
[02:27:24.934 --> 02:27:30.917]  In 2018-19, I forget what it was, Donald Trump said Israel owns our Congress.
[02:27:31.117 --> 02:27:31.557]  He said it!
[02:27:32.540 --> 02:27:33.120]  He said it!
[02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:35.161]  Israel owns our Congress.
[02:27:35.281 --> 02:27:36.261]  Donald Trump in an interview.
[02:27:36.281 --> 02:27:37.461]  Go ahead and pull that up.
[02:27:39.582 --> 02:27:40.142]  I've seen it.
[02:27:40.262 --> 02:27:41.882]  It's so obvious.
[02:27:42.762 --> 02:27:53.405]  But, you know, you have these... But see, it's even worse, because you can... I mean, the entire Biden administration are dual state citizens of Israel and the United States.
[02:27:53.665 --> 02:27:56.145]  These are people that are not even elected, Happy.
[02:27:56.205 --> 02:27:57.426]  They're not even... or Pappy, I'm sorry.
[02:27:57.566 --> 02:27:58.466]  They're not even elected!
[02:28:00.506 --> 02:28:10.391]  Well, you see it with Jeffrey Epstein, you see it with all this going on in the intelligence community, and it's just so blatant.
[02:28:10.471 --> 02:28:15.393]  But I'd really like to know, they claim they're serious people.
[02:28:15.212 --> 02:28:18.611]   you know they claim these, you know they claim they're serious people.
[02:28:18.611 --> 02:28:25.512]   If they were serious people, why, why was George, why was Santos thrown out in a matter
[02:28:25.512 --> 02:28:26.512]  of minutes?
[02:28:27.293 --> 02:28:35.534]  Bob Menendez is so clearly working with foreign governments, yet nothing will ever happen to him.
[02:28:35.554 --> 02:28:38.935]  Yeah, nothing happens to Bob Menendez, nothing happens to Fat Fanny Willis.
[02:28:39.035 --> 02:28:39.855]  They just get caught.
[02:28:40.375 --> 02:28:42.536]  But George Santos, he's got to go.
[02:28:42.916 --> 02:28:47.837]  I don't know why Republicans like throwing pick sixes in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl, but they seem to really love it.
[02:28:47.897 --> 02:28:49.037]  That's kind of their legacy.
[02:28:50.137 --> 02:28:54.159]  Pick sixes at the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl.
[02:28:54.179 --> 02:28:55.340]  That's what they're into.
[02:28:55.940 --> 02:28:56.260]  I don't know.
[02:28:56.301 --> 02:28:57.161]  You'd have to ask them that.
[02:28:57.321 --> 02:29:04.545]  But look, I don't think that's the future of the Republican Party, but it's been that way for far too long, and now they lose a House vote over it.
[02:29:04.785 --> 02:29:05.746]  It's truly pathetic stuff.
[02:29:06.026 --> 02:29:07.447]  Let's go to Andre in Arizona.
[02:29:07.547 --> 02:29:08.247]  Andre, you're on the air.
[02:29:08.267 --> 02:29:08.627]  Go ahead.
[02:29:11.889 --> 02:29:12.169]  Hello?
[02:29:12.990 --> 02:29:13.410]  Can you hear me?
[02:29:15.852 --> 02:29:15.992]  Yes.
[02:29:18.766 --> 02:29:20.448]  Alright, let's go to Sean in Texas.
[02:29:20.488 --> 02:29:21.088]  You're on the air.
[02:29:21.128 --> 02:29:21.829]  Sean, go ahead.
[02:29:22.730 --> 02:29:25.973]  Hey Owen, two quick comments and a prediction I think is important.
[02:29:25.993 --> 02:29:35.643]  First of all, listening to Fannie Willis reminded me, do you remember that guy from Georgia that was claiming that if we had too much military equipment on Guam it would capsize?
[02:29:37.685 --> 02:29:40.247]  That's what she reminded me of when she started talking about continents.
[02:29:40.388 --> 02:29:46.659]   And then to the New York police officers, If you break the law, you're gonna be punished.
[02:29:46.699 --> 02:29:48.721]  Well, they broke the law coming in the country.
[02:29:48.761 --> 02:29:49.942]  They're already lawbreakers.
[02:29:49.962 --> 02:29:50.362]  That's right.
[02:29:50.382 --> 02:29:51.243]  They're just deportable.
[02:29:51.263 --> 02:29:51.683]  That's right.
[02:29:51.743 --> 02:30:01.691]  And the last thing, and I think this is important and I haven't heard anybody say this, the way, the only thing that stops the takeover of America is the armed populace.
[02:30:02.352 --> 02:30:05.254]  And I think what they're gonna do is they're gonna activate the sleeper cells.
[02:30:06.135 --> 02:30:08.117]  You're gonna see about a week of hell on earth.
[02:30:08.577 --> 02:30:13.421]  And then the government's gonna come out, probably the Biden administration, and say, we have to pick up all of the guns.
[02:30:14.289 --> 02:30:16.378]  From everyone in order to stop it.
[02:30:16.559 --> 02:30:18.909]  I think they're going to use that as a pretext to take the guns.
[02:30:20.694 --> 02:30:23.355]  Well, there's no doubt they want to take all the guns.
[02:30:23.375 --> 02:30:33.920]  They're already trying to pass legislation to ban the Second Amendment, not just to stop your right to own firearms or the right to bear firearms, but they're also trying to stop the right to form a militia.
[02:30:33.980 --> 02:30:39.522]  They have bills that they're trying to pass in Congress right now banning militia groups.
[02:30:39.662 --> 02:30:40.823]  So yeah, absolutely.
[02:30:40.843 --> 02:30:42.023]  Of course, that's what tyrants want.
[02:30:42.043 --> 02:30:43.384]  They don't want there to be a populace.
[02:30:43.664 --> 02:30:47.946]  They don't want there to be citizen groups that can defend themselves against a tyrannical government.
[02:30:48.326 --> 02:30:49.227]  That's what all tyrants do.
[02:30:49.267 --> 02:30:50.547]  That's what all authoritarians do.
[02:30:50.627 --> 02:30:53.409]  So, of course, that's what they're going to push for in Congress.
[02:30:53.449 --> 02:30:54.189]  But I don't know, Sean.
[02:30:54.209 --> 02:30:59.152]  I think that that might be... They might even know that that's probably taking it too far.
[02:30:59.252 --> 02:31:02.194]  They like to kind of do things cloak and dagger politically.
[02:31:03.868 --> 02:31:09.494]  And if there is some event like that, how are they gonna not take the blame when they opened the border wide open?
[02:31:10.074 --> 02:31:15.640]  I don't know how they avoid taking the blame for an event like that when it was them that let all the terrorists in, should that be the case.
[02:31:16.001 --> 02:31:19.044]  Alright, I'm gonna do five more minutes, take a couple calls, and then Jay Dyer takes over.
[02:31:19.284 --> 02:31:20.725]  Hey, I got some good news for everybody.

[02:32:16.651 --> 02:32:23.155]  There's a lot of times we have unintentional art here on the show.
[02:32:24.436 --> 02:32:30.279]  And I don't know where the crew found this futuristic, you know, futurism, metropolitan art.
[02:32:32.081 --> 02:32:34.262]  And then the music behind it, you can see it, you can feel it.
[02:32:35.779 --> 02:32:36.860]  But see, that's what it is.
[02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:37.560]  We can see it.
[02:32:37.620 --> 02:32:38.100]  We can feel it.
[02:32:38.120 --> 02:32:39.941]  We know that this is supposed to be our destiny.
[02:32:39.981 --> 02:32:41.382]  We know that this could be our future.
[02:32:41.402 --> 02:32:43.703]  This could be our now, and it's all being stolen from us.
[02:32:45.684 --> 02:32:46.785]  It's all being ripped away.
[02:32:48.626 --> 02:32:49.706]  These should be our cities.
[02:32:49.786 --> 02:32:51.047]  These should be our civic centers.
[02:32:51.087 --> 02:32:56.930]  These should be the images of our future, humanity, on planet Earth.
[02:32:59.266 --> 02:33:04.690]  And yet here we are and we have something closer to the decaying city represented in idiocracy.
[02:33:05.050 --> 02:33:06.271]  But this is where you belong.
[02:33:06.571 --> 02:33:07.632]  This is what you can see.
[02:33:10.413 --> 02:33:11.874]  And it's all being stolen from us.
[02:33:14.056 --> 02:33:15.056]  But we're here to take it back.
[02:33:16.597 --> 02:33:18.799]  Couple more calls before Jay Dyer takes over.
[02:33:19.459 --> 02:33:21.220]  We go to Andreas in New York.
[02:33:21.320 --> 02:33:22.161]  Andreas, you're on the air.
[02:33:22.201 --> 02:33:22.581]  Go ahead.
[02:33:23.762 --> 02:33:24.763]  Hey, what's up, brother?
[02:33:24.863 --> 02:33:27.104]  First of all, I just want to say thank you for everything.
[02:33:27.164 --> 02:33:35.409]   I've been watching you since Those anti-Trump rallies disguised as pro-woman marches where you used to own everybody over there, so I really appreciate you for that.
[02:33:35.429 --> 02:33:36.891]  That's right, that's what they really were.
[02:33:36.931 --> 02:33:38.232]  They don't give a damn about women.
[02:33:39.153 --> 02:33:40.734]  Yeah, it was hilarious watching those.
[02:33:40.774 --> 02:33:59.932]   But I wanted to ask you, because I was just learning about a new rule they placed in New York called the 2-13 rule on quarantines given the state health commission's More basically power to enforce quarantines and decide where they would be held just in case that happens.
[02:33:59.952 --> 02:34:01.053]  Do you know anything about that?
[02:34:02.234 --> 02:34:02.534]  No.
[02:34:03.134 --> 02:34:06.737]  I mean, I could have the crew plug it into a search engine here and they can put something on the screen.
[02:34:07.738 --> 02:34:10.460]  I'm not surprised New York would try to do something like that.
[02:34:11.061 --> 02:34:20.468]  And I guess they had some trouble quarantining y'all during COVID and so they have to power grab right now before the new virus used to make you a slave.
[02:34:21.744 --> 02:34:25.687]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure they snuck that in, but that kind of ties into what I wanted to ask.
[02:34:25.727 --> 02:34:29.730]  What do you think the next post-flag situation will be before election?
[02:34:29.750 --> 02:34:33.792]  Do you think it's that any virus or the sleeper cells?
[02:34:33.812 --> 02:34:34.793]  What do you think it's going to be?
[02:34:35.093 --> 02:34:36.694]  No, I think it's a big war event.
[02:34:37.275 --> 02:34:38.295]  I've kind of been saying this.
[02:34:38.315 --> 02:34:39.856]  This is a popular question I get asked.
[02:34:40.097 --> 02:34:42.398]  I think it's a major escalation in the war.
[02:34:42.558 --> 02:34:43.319]  That's what I think.
[02:34:43.559 --> 02:35:02.399]   I think it's a dirty bomb or something going off, maybe in the Middle East or Ukraine, and it's going to be Use to really further the tensions and to push either Russia's hand or Iran's hand or even the US's hand into really further escalating the wars.
[02:35:02.439 --> 02:35:11.628]  That's kind of what I think is the leader in the clubhouse for me if I'm the odds maker for what major event is going to be used to push the globalist agenda, the corporate global government agenda.
[02:35:12.512 --> 02:35:14.814]  I'd say major false flag, major war event.
[02:35:14.834 --> 02:35:18.076]  But there's cyber attacks, there's, you know, disease X that they're talking about.
[02:35:18.556 --> 02:35:21.318]  I mean, there could be a weather phenomenon, so who knows?
[02:35:21.378 --> 02:35:22.139]  It's all on the board.
[02:35:22.739 --> 02:35:23.300]  Thanks for the call.
[02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:26.162]  Let's squeeze in Jay real quick before Jay Dyer takes over.
[02:35:26.322 --> 02:35:27.503]  Jay in Georgia, go ahead.
[02:35:28.924 --> 02:35:30.745]  Hey, Owen, it's an honor to talk to you.
[02:35:30.765 --> 02:35:31.646]  What's going on, buddy?
[02:35:31.906 --> 02:35:32.146]  Howdy.
[02:35:33.427 --> 02:35:33.888]  Can you hear me?
[02:35:34.428 --> 02:35:34.628]  Yes.
[02:35:35.128 --> 02:35:35.429]  Hello?
[02:35:36.249 --> 02:35:36.710]  Can you hear me?
[02:35:37.540 --> 02:35:37.800]  Man.
[02:35:37.940 --> 02:35:38.260]  Oh no.
[02:35:38.780 --> 02:35:39.260]  We had him.
[02:35:40.121 --> 02:35:40.961]  He had his chance.
[02:35:41.681 --> 02:35:42.381]  He was right there.
[02:35:42.401 --> 02:35:43.642]  He had it in his hand.
[02:35:43.662 --> 02:35:47.663]  It just...slipped away.
[02:35:48.963 --> 02:35:50.764]  Nonetheless, we're up against the break here anyway.
[02:35:51.244 --> 02:35:52.484]  Jay Dyer's about to take over.
[02:35:52.504 --> 02:35:53.945]  He also has Sam Tripoli with him.
[02:35:54.525 --> 02:35:58.926]  So it's going to be a fun time with them here on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:36:00.020 --> 02:36:04.526]  And then we're going to have Harrison Smith filling in for me on the InfoWars War Room.
[02:36:04.766 --> 02:36:07.390]  And Alex is working on some things behind the scenes, and I'll tell you that...
[02:36:08.781 --> 02:36:12.805]  I happen to be working on some things behind the scenes as well.
[02:36:13.165 --> 02:36:13.666]  Yes.
[02:36:14.086 --> 02:36:14.606]  Excellent.
[02:36:15.347 --> 02:36:20.351]  So we continue to work harder than ever thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:36:20.652 --> 02:36:23.034]  But I may have to go get a scoop of Turbo Force Plus.
[02:36:23.314 --> 02:36:24.875]  I was drinking the coffee today.
[02:36:24.895 --> 02:36:27.238]  I was drinking the coffee from InfoWarsStore.com today.
[02:36:27.338 --> 02:36:29.379]  When I host the Jones Show, sometimes I'll hit the coffee.
[02:36:30.396 --> 02:36:40.887]  Uh, so we have great coffee at Infowarsstore.com, one great way to support us if you're a coffee drinker, but I think I might need for this next project I'm working on to get through the rest of the day, I think I'm gonna need some TurboForce Plus.
[02:36:41.648 --> 02:36:45.592]  Ten hours of clean energy in one scoop of TurboForce Plus.
[02:36:45.812 --> 02:36:49.996]  Forty percent off right now at Infowarsstore.com, and it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[02:36:50.036 --> 02:36:53.500]  Alright, short break, and then Jay Dyer takes over with Sam Tripoli.
[02:36:54.232 --> 02:36:56.195]  Welcome to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:36:56.215 --> 02:36:58.277]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[02:36:58.698 --> 02:37:08.611]  And in honor of today's guest, I've worn my Martha Stewart super heterosexual summer living line shirt for Sam Tripoli.
[02:37:09.697 --> 02:37:12.900]  And if you don't know Sam Tripoli, then I don't know where you've been.
[02:37:12.980 --> 02:37:16.023]  He's one of the coolest stand-up comedians out there.
[02:37:16.083 --> 02:37:17.404]  He's got multiple podcasts.
[02:37:17.444 --> 02:37:22.429]  He's got more podcasts than he does freaking social media profiles.
[02:37:22.449 --> 02:37:23.410]  Dude, I can't even keep up.
[02:37:23.830 --> 02:37:25.031]  I'm trying to find Sam Tripoli.
[02:37:25.051 --> 02:37:26.532]  There's like 50 Sam Tripolis.
[02:37:26.572 --> 02:37:28.054]  Dude, which one's the real you, dude?
[02:37:28.968 --> 02:37:29.969]  Who knows?
[02:37:30.009 --> 02:37:31.189]  Who knows, bro?
[02:37:31.209 --> 02:37:32.610]  How are you, Jay Dyer?
[02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:37.752]  Like, Jay, I swear, like, look at your background and how amazing it is.
[02:37:37.932 --> 02:37:43.255]  I attempted that at one point, and my background has been just annihilated by my daughters.
[02:37:43.375 --> 02:37:44.936]  They just, they love books.
[02:37:44.996 --> 02:37:46.196]  They love to chew on my books.
[02:37:46.216 --> 02:37:53.180]  So I get these very deep, deep, sometimes expensive books, and they just gnaw on them like, like beavers.
[02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:56.281]  So I want to have a background like Jay Dyer.
[02:37:56.321 --> 02:37:58.182]  That's what, I'm like, oh, I could do it like this.
[02:37:58.562 --> 02:37:59.583]  And look what I got.
[02:37:59.603 --> 02:38:01.904]  It looks like a bad garage sale.
[02:38:02.905 --> 02:38:03.285]  Thanks, man.
[02:38:03.305 --> 02:38:04.886]  Well, this is all my beaver section.
[02:38:04.946 --> 02:38:06.707]  So this is all beaver studies right here.
[02:38:07.027 --> 02:38:08.368]  Beaver studies department.
[02:38:08.568 --> 02:38:08.968]  The library.
[02:38:08.988 --> 02:38:10.509]  You look good, buddy.
[02:38:11.970 --> 02:38:13.531]  Sam, thanks for coming on, man.
[02:38:13.551 --> 02:38:14.491]  I appreciate it.
[02:38:14.571 --> 02:38:16.332]  I want to get into entertainment.
[02:38:16.412 --> 02:38:18.573]  You're one of the best stand-ups out there.
[02:38:18.613 --> 02:38:19.334]  I love your stuff.
[02:38:19.901 --> 02:38:26.243]  Been on your show many, many times, and you seem to have one of the best takes when it comes to entertainment.
[02:38:26.283 --> 02:38:27.704]  I mean, you always nail it.
[02:38:27.924 --> 02:38:30.525]  You don't go with, like, the surface-level stuff that's going on.
[02:38:30.545 --> 02:38:32.885]  So let's talk about the Taylor Swift Psy-Op first.
[02:38:33.045 --> 02:38:39.388]  Do you think that it is a kind of a Psy-Op that was going on with the soap opera drama with her and Travis?
[02:38:39.408 --> 02:38:40.648]  What's your analysis of all that?
[02:38:41.502 --> 02:38:43.243]  Well, you know, it's really crazy about that.
[02:38:43.263 --> 02:38:47.266]  It's like everything that conspiracy theorists said were going to happen literally happened.
[02:38:47.506 --> 02:39:01.036]  Like it literally happened exactly how we said it was going to happen, even to the point where the 49ers made the wrong decision in the, uh, in the overtime to allow Patrick Mohamed to have the ball last, which was not a good idea.
[02:39:01.436 --> 02:39:06.620]  So that even worked out then them coming and making out in the middle of the field after the championship.
[02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:16.866]  That, that happened, and then the ratings being like 7 million more than any other Super Bowl ever, being the most watched television show of all time.
[02:39:17.226 --> 02:39:19.408]  So, yeah, I do think something's up.
[02:39:19.468 --> 02:39:24.631]  Now, my biggest problem with all this is like, to be honest with you, I mean, Taylor Swift is what Taylor Swift is.
[02:39:25.371 --> 02:39:35.297]  I have two of her songs in my workout plan, like when I really gotta push it, and I'm going for, you know, to put up the 45s on the bench, I'll put in Bad Blood or something like that, so I'm not gonna lie to you, okay?
[02:39:36.630 --> 02:39:37.551]  Here's the thing, dude.
[02:39:38.692 --> 02:39:41.174]  Everyone knows that sports is bread and circus.
[02:39:41.294 --> 02:39:45.917]  My issue right now with where sports is going is like we don't even get the bread and circus anymore.
[02:39:46.218 --> 02:39:48.980]  Now we still get the propaganda going on during that.
[02:39:49.240 --> 02:39:53.663]  So we don't even get that break, that kind of like smoke screen for what's really going on.
[02:39:54.024 --> 02:40:01.193]   So do I believe That the Taylor Swift-Travis Kelce relationship isn't real 100%.
[02:40:02.535 --> 02:40:06.458]  If you look at his ex-girlfriends, he loves futuristic hot black women.
[02:40:06.498 --> 02:40:08.340]  That tends to be the chicks he's into.
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:13.204]  And now he's dating a chick who has the vibe, the sexual energy of a 4x4.
[02:40:14.925 --> 02:40:15.946]  Uh, it is what it is.
[02:40:15.966 --> 02:40:23.694]  I don't have any ill will towards her, but it just sucks that we, we can't even have these like, you know, I, I still watch ESPN.
[02:40:23.754 --> 02:40:24.114]  I'm old.
[02:40:24.214 --> 02:40:28.539]  I still watch ESPN and you know, Patrick McAvee's on there and he's got a great show.
[02:40:29.528 --> 02:40:33.452]  The best, and you know, he's getting some flack about his ratings.
[02:40:33.552 --> 02:40:34.933]  I think his show's great, I don't know.
[02:40:35.213 --> 02:40:39.373]   But it's hard to get good ratings when you're forced to talk about, you know, Iowa woman's
[02:40:39.373 --> 02:40:44.353]   basketball for five minutes and your whole crew has to act like they're enthralled with
[02:40:44.353 --> 02:40:50.233]   this storyline about this woman spending more money, scoring more points than ever.
[02:40:50.233 --> 02:40:55.052]   And then you follow it with a funny story about out of Houston, CJ Stroud making fun
[02:40:55.052 --> 02:40:56.654]  of these old NFL players.
[02:40:56.654 --> 02:40:58.432]  And the energy just shifts.
[02:40:58.432 --> 02:41:02.634]   It just totally shifts from what guys really want to hear to what we're forced to hear.
[02:41:02.634 --> 02:41:03.953]  And that's what I'm talking about.
[02:41:03.953 --> 02:41:06.593]  The bread and circus, like it's just gone now.
[02:41:06.593 --> 02:41:10.673]   Now because we don't watch any of their their programming anymore.
[02:41:10.673 --> 02:41:14.432]   Now they've infiltrated sports and they've ruined that as well.
[02:41:14.432 --> 02:41:15.734]  Yeah.
[02:41:15.734 --> 02:41:20.593]   Did you see the clip where NATO was talking about batting around the idea of using Taylor
[02:41:20.593 --> 02:41:23.834]  Swift as a SIA disinformation tool?
[02:41:23.829 --> 02:41:25.290]  I don't know if you saw that it was going around.
[02:41:25.310 --> 02:41:26.691]  It was an actual NATO meeting.
[02:41:27.212 --> 02:41:40.001]   And to me, that suggests that, yeah, that, you know, pop stars oftentimes, especially at that mega level, They can often be co-opted for, you know, political purposes beyond even NATO or some kind of PSYOP thing.
[02:41:40.201 --> 02:41:48.185]  We know that, you know, famous pop stars in the past, Elvis, people like that, they've been used by the deep state at various levels to push agendas.
[02:41:48.205 --> 02:41:51.106]  I mean, do you think that's out of the realm of possibility here?
[02:41:51.146 --> 02:41:56.409]  We know that at the least she's basically telling everybody to vote for Bobo, you know, Joe Biden, right?
[02:41:56.429 --> 02:41:59.691]  I mean, the DNC usually likes to pull in these pop stars.
[02:41:59.711 --> 02:42:00.471]  What do you think about that?
[02:42:01.640 --> 02:42:02.081]  Oh, 100%.
[02:42:02.761 --> 02:42:05.805]  I mean, like, nothing about Taylor Swift is authentic, right?
[02:42:05.865 --> 02:42:11.250]  Like, even her origin story, her father had to buy the record label to get her on the record label.
[02:42:11.951 --> 02:42:18.838]  And so the whole thing is just she, at some point, somebody made a deal with somebody and they just mega blew her up.
[02:42:18.897 --> 02:42:23.777]   If you look at old Taylor Swift versus new Taylor Swift, it's not the same kind of energy.
[02:42:23.777 --> 02:42:28.018]   And I guess we all grow, but it's definitely got darker energy.
[02:42:28.018 --> 02:42:32.777]   If you see, she has a lot of references to witches now and all that stuff.
[02:42:32.777 --> 02:42:39.857]   So, you know, we just did a episode on Tim Full How about Marilyn Monroe and like the dark, dark darkness
[02:42:39.857 --> 02:42:43.337]   behind her, like, and like, I don't think people really understand
[02:42:43.337 --> 02:42:49.096]   how dark Marilyn Monroe's life really was and how she was basically, you know, foster care.
[02:42:49.096 --> 02:42:53.336]   And then somehow just became one, honestly, one of the most powerful people in the world
[02:42:53.336 --> 02:42:54.637]  with all the men she was bedding.
[02:42:55.374 --> 02:42:56.135]  That's what they use.
[02:42:56.155 --> 02:43:03.420]  You talk about all the time, MKUltra, uh, you know, kittens being used, uh, to basically control men.
[02:43:03.460 --> 02:43:15.389]  And if you look at, like, who Marilyn Monroe was hooking up with, it was, it was all of the, uh, both, both the Kennedy's, uh, Frank Sinatra, the head of the mob, and then some Russian spy, and that was the end.
[02:43:15.709 --> 02:43:17.991]  So Taylor Swift is going to be no different than that.
[02:43:18.131 --> 02:43:18.672]  Why would she?
[02:43:19.810 --> 02:43:21.952]  How big she is isn't authentic.
[02:43:22.032 --> 02:43:22.652]  That's how you know.
[02:43:22.692 --> 02:43:25.534]  To get to that level is not really authentic.
[02:43:25.594 --> 02:43:29.296]  And we saw her with Ice Spice, who's the Queen of the Downs, okay?
[02:43:29.837 --> 02:43:33.019]  And her throwing all the satanic symbolism right there.
[02:43:33.039 --> 02:43:34.660]  It's right there.
[02:43:34.700 --> 02:43:48.449]  And I think that's why the commercial with the Jesus and the feet got such a poor reception, because Christians are already, you know, in their, you know, their defense stance, waiting for all the demonic imagery to come at them.
[02:43:49.532 --> 02:43:55.019]  And it just, it ended up making that commercial not be received very well.
[02:43:55.099 --> 02:43:56.501]  So yes, it's all crazy.
[02:43:56.521 --> 02:43:57.502]  I mean, it's all crazy.
[02:43:58.223 --> 02:44:01.988]  Everything we thought was going to happen at this Super Bowl ended up happening.
[02:44:03.792 --> 02:44:05.633]  Yeah, I heard iSpice.
[02:44:06.633 --> 02:44:07.993]  That's the Spice Girls?
[02:44:08.053 --> 02:44:08.514]  Who is this?
[02:44:08.574 --> 02:44:16.296]  I didn't even realize she's a... She's a Ronald McDonald-looking short bus rapper, right?
[02:44:16.356 --> 02:44:21.818]  She looks like Leloo, like multi-pass, but mixed with Ronald McDonald.
[02:44:23.064 --> 02:44:54.815]   And she just her whole thing is working and showing you her portals and that's really what she does and it's it's idiocracy times a thousand and I don't have anything against her as a person but what she represents is you know and we've been talking about this in the conspiracy world forever Is about how, like, Gangster Rap was completely co-op by the CIA and then, lo and behold, who comes out and says, you know, Ice Cube says that, yeah, they basically co-opted it and here we got Ice Spice just throwing out the worst of the worst!
[02:44:54.935 --> 02:44:56.636]  I mean, it's so bad!
[02:44:57.196 --> 02:44:57.776]  It's so bad.
[02:44:58.137 --> 02:44:58.697]  It's so bad.
[02:44:59.801 --> 02:45:10.004]  Yeah, I want to talk about Ice Cube and the stories that have come out relating to Diddy, stuff like that, because that's actually really relevant to the control of the entertainment world.
[02:45:11.144 --> 02:45:13.785]  But on that point about Marilyn Monroe, I'm glad you mentioned that.
[02:45:13.945 --> 02:45:21.176]   I did a podcast recently with Sammy the Bulgar Von, the most famous living gangster hitman I heard some things.
[02:45:21.236 --> 02:45:22.357]  We had to take care of her.
[02:45:22.176 --> 02:45:27.056]   what you said as well, Sam. He said, he said, although he wasn't involved in the actual
[02:45:27.056 --> 02:45:31.015]  planning, I heard some things we had to take care of her.
[02:45:31.015 --> 02:45:36.786]   She might talk. I mean, literally says, yeah, we, we, we had to make that decision because
[02:45:36.786 --> 02:45:40.656]   she was being used as a kind of a honeypot for multiple people.
[02:45:40.675 --> 02:45:46.876]  She was basically a honeypot for like four different groups, the government, the mob, CIA, everybody was using her.
[02:45:47.276 --> 02:45:48.257]  And so they had to get rid of her.
[02:45:48.357 --> 02:45:52.057]  So I think you're spot on with Marilyn Monroe there as an example.
[02:45:52.958 --> 02:45:54.018]  I got a question for you, though.
[02:45:54.638 --> 02:45:58.639]  Now, I didn't see this until like a couple of days ago.
[02:45:59.722 --> 02:46:04.888]  But you got confronted by one of the top Hollywood, which is boyfriend.
[02:46:05.909 --> 02:46:10.975]  At your comedy event, machine gun Kelly showed up and kind of gave you a little bit of sass.
[02:46:11.035 --> 02:46:17.923]  He got like, yeah, sassy with now I'm bringing that up because Megan Kelly, I mean, Megan Fox had that that interview.
[02:46:18.795 --> 02:46:26.338]  Not too long ago that went somewhat viral where she was talking about drinking blood and this is actually part of her and Machine Gun Kelly's ritual.
[02:46:26.959 --> 02:46:33.601]  So I don't know if you saw that clip, but this seems like something that's actually also going on in the high levels of entertainment.
[02:46:33.661 --> 02:46:42.185]  If you remember back in the day, Alex used to play this clip all the time of Angelina Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton talking about drinking each other's blood.
[02:46:42.325 --> 02:46:43.946]  So there's actually something to this too.
[02:46:45.129 --> 02:46:48.392]  Yeah, man, it's all God versus fallen angels, dude.
[02:46:48.432 --> 02:46:52.316]  And you know, it's like you and I can have that conversation and people be like, yeah, it's fine.
[02:46:52.336 --> 02:46:53.197]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[02:46:53.617 --> 02:46:58.262]  But in Hollywood that I might as well just be speaking Chinese with these people.
[02:46:58.621 --> 02:47:02.261]   It's they have no clue what they're what they're getting into.
[02:47:02.261 --> 02:47:03.742]  And this is the game.
[02:47:03.742 --> 02:47:04.742]  And this is what happens.
[02:47:04.742 --> 02:47:09.621]   And eventually you have to, you know, pay your dues, meaning that there's going to come
[02:47:09.621 --> 02:47:13.540]   a time where you have to go forward and talk about all the witchcraft that you're into.
[02:47:13.540 --> 02:47:16.501]  You know, Taylor Swift again calls her fans witches.
[02:47:16.501 --> 02:47:19.061]  You know, she has a black cube that she's on.
[02:47:19.152 --> 02:47:22.252]  I mean, she has these weird kind of ceremonies on stage.
[02:47:22.573 --> 02:47:30.274]  And it just, it gets down to, you know, Kurt Metzger talked about this in a weird way too, because I do believe they worship the fallen.
[02:47:30.394 --> 02:47:34.636]  I really do believe at the highest levels of power, that is what is worshipped.
[02:47:35.056 --> 02:47:39.677]  If you ask me, based on all my research, fallen angels versus God.
[02:47:39.817 --> 02:48:05.665]   I mean, have you watched these videos, dude, where these chicks, they go from looking like they're like, Lot lizards to like the most gorgeous human being on the planet just by putting on makeup and then you realize like that's what like part of the sorcery that was given to him by fallen angels do and you start seeing it everywhere you start seeing programming you know television that's all it is everything is about
[02:48:06.494 --> 02:48:09.375]  Trying to manipulate you and brainwash you.
[02:48:09.815 --> 02:48:14.816]  And so, right now what's going on in Hollywood is that everyone's like, oh my God, Hollywood's losing money.
[02:48:15.076 --> 02:48:16.516]  They don't care about losing money.
[02:48:16.676 --> 02:48:25.118]  They don't care because the Federal Reserve comes in, they'll make up a fake event, and they'll clean up all the red with a bailout.
[02:48:25.178 --> 02:48:26.399]  That's just the way it goes.
[02:48:26.519 --> 02:48:31.300]  The Federal Reserve is the center behind all problems.
[02:48:32.361 --> 02:48:37.968]  The problem they're having now is that nobody's watching their product.
[02:48:38.448 --> 02:48:42.253]  You can't brainwash somebody if nobody's watching it.
[02:48:42.293 --> 02:48:46.938]  And that's why I think, like, why do they bring back Jon Stewart back to The Daily Show?
[02:48:47.158 --> 02:48:48.720]  Because he's from the glory days.
[02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:51.864]  So they're making this attempt to lure us back in.
[02:48:52.624 --> 02:48:56.448]  Uh, to watch their, their, their really, really dark stuff.
[02:48:56.528 --> 02:48:58.150]  And it's, it's all dark.
[02:48:58.310 --> 02:49:00.132]  I mean, I don't care what anybody says.
[02:49:00.712 --> 02:49:02.274]  It's just unbelievable to me.
[02:49:02.314 --> 02:49:09.080]  We're in this cultural Marxism movement that is at its deepest roots about dark arts and fallen angels.
[02:49:09.180 --> 02:49:10.482]  And yeah, that's what happens.
[02:49:10.842 --> 02:49:11.663]  I believe in all of it.
[02:49:13.484 --> 02:49:24.470]  Yeah, I was watching a bunch of videos from even Vice Magazine, which is no good, but they had a guy that they were interviewing from Hollywood.
[02:49:24.550 --> 02:49:29.653]  He works in a lot of high-end hotels, basically the really elite hotels.
[02:49:30.573 --> 02:49:35.177]  Giving an undercover interview saying that all the stuff you see in Eyes Wide Shut is actually real.
[02:49:35.757 --> 02:49:39.140]  That, you know, zillionaires will basically rent out the hotels.
[02:49:39.280 --> 02:49:42.043]  It's a giant, you know, O-R-G-Y.
[02:49:42.063 --> 02:49:50.429]  And I bring that up because, you know, I'm not trying to get too controversial here, but Cat Williams did a recent interview that went mega viral.
[02:49:50.469 --> 02:49:54.072]  I think it had like, something like 60, 70 million views now.
[02:49:54.693 --> 02:49:58.276]  And particularly on the notion of blackmail in Hollywood.
[02:49:58.676 --> 02:50:05.720]  He talked about this idea that even some of the entertainers, he alleges, you know, P Diddy.
[02:50:05.740 --> 02:50:10.522]  There's a lot of people in Hollywood that's doing stuff you wouldn't believe, okay?
[02:50:11.002 --> 02:50:13.824]  And they're trying to get up inside of you with rituals.
[02:50:13.924 --> 02:50:15.064]  Okay, he says rituals.
[02:50:15.365 --> 02:50:17.586]  He says that they're, you know, trying to blackmail people.
[02:50:18.346 --> 02:50:22.568]  And he alleges people like P Diddy might have been doing this kind of stuff.
[02:50:22.868 --> 02:50:25.590]  That's been alleged on the internet for a long time.
[02:50:26.144 --> 02:50:37.028]  I don't know if you saw that interview, but did you have any take on that in terms of particularly the topics of a lot of entertainers in the black entertainment scene being compromised?
[02:50:37.708 --> 02:50:48.572]  Well, I was hanging out in Austin at a comedy club, and a comedian asked me, why is Barack Obama suddenly being outed as gay?
[02:50:48.592 --> 02:50:50.753]  And I go, it's all a demoralization campaign.
[02:50:51.508 --> 02:50:53.749]  We are in the biggest demoralization campaign.
[02:50:54.089 --> 02:50:55.369]  So, what do you do, man?
[02:50:55.429 --> 02:50:56.829]  How do you demoralize somebody?
[02:50:56.849 --> 02:50:58.750]  You position people of power.
[02:50:58.910 --> 02:51:03.091]  You blackmail them through whatever weird, kinky sex they're into.
[02:51:03.551 --> 02:51:05.031]  And you use that to control them.
[02:51:05.311 --> 02:51:07.832]  And they, in turn, use that to control others.
[02:51:07.932 --> 02:51:09.753]  And that, you know, I say this all the time.
[02:51:09.813 --> 02:51:18.695]  Pedophilia is the gateway, the ritual to the highest levels of power.
[02:51:19.055 --> 02:51:19.735]  That's how you do it.
[02:51:20.330 --> 02:51:27.237]  You control people through their sexual, uh, whatever weird stuff they're into, and that's how you get them to do what you want them to do.
[02:51:27.297 --> 02:51:30.820]  So, do I believe that Hollywood is corrupted like that?
[02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:30.820]  100%. 100%.
[02:51:34.409 --> 02:51:43.053]  And they also promote, you know, people that they know are shady to eventually out them as shady to demoralize us later on.
[02:51:43.093 --> 02:51:49.697]  When you worship somebody and love them as a fan and then you find out everything about them was a lie, that is demoralization.
[02:51:49.737 --> 02:51:54.139]  Your anxiety goes up, your depression goes up, so that's the whole game right there.
[02:51:54.299 --> 02:51:59.922]  It is a demoralization campaign like we've probably never seen since the Bolshevik War.
[02:52:01.886 --> 02:52:05.789]  Yeah, you had a good guest on.
[02:52:06.209 --> 02:52:15.696]  You were talking about PSYOPs and massive media PSYOPs and disinformation campaigns and how they really want to demoralize us through all of these public rituals.
[02:52:15.736 --> 02:52:20.680]  I mean, do you think that that's crazy, the idea that the Super Bowl itself is a high-profile ritual?
[02:52:20.700 --> 02:52:34.015]   I know we've talked about that a lot, but it's good to revisit this stuff because it used to be we would get these kind of big satanic slash masonic ceremonies at the Super Bowl with with Pink or with Lady Gaga, Katy Perry comes out riding
[02:52:34.015 --> 02:52:38.467]   the Beast like the whore rides the Beast in the book of Revelation.
[02:52:38.467 --> 02:52:42.746]   Is that far-fetched though that there would be actual planning to make the ceremonies
[02:52:42.746 --> 02:52:44.066]  high-profile rituals?
[02:52:44.066 --> 02:52:49.746]   No, I mean if you study Lady Gaga, I think she was either the half-time show.
[02:52:49.919 --> 02:52:51.981]  I mean, I think it was in Dallas Stadium.
[02:52:52.482 --> 02:53:04.395]  She starts off in the heavens, and then she descends down, which is the story of Lucifer, descends down to the lowest levels, and she's surrounded by pentagrams, and everyone's just like, ah, this is such an entertaining...
[02:53:05.456 --> 02:53:11.260]  Uh, Super Bowl show and it's just like, dude, that's the story of Lucifer, like right there.
[02:53:11.821 --> 02:53:13.983]  And that's why they, cause they have the most eyeballs.
[02:53:14.063 --> 02:53:15.544]  It's the best way to affect you.
[02:53:15.584 --> 02:53:18.747]  It's the best way to, to brainwash you.
[02:53:18.767 --> 02:53:21.569]  And then what they get you to do is just to open up.
[02:53:21.589 --> 02:53:21.769]  Yeah.
[02:53:21.789 --> 02:53:22.150]  Look at this.
[02:53:22.290 --> 02:53:25.332]  It's, it's the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[02:53:25.412 --> 02:53:30.557]  And you tell a Normie that, and by the way, look at her, she's got the Panda eyes, the famous Panda eyes.
[02:53:30.937 --> 02:53:31.617]  It looks like that.
[02:53:32.458 --> 02:53:34.799]  This looks like David Bowie's gonna descend.
[02:53:35.039 --> 02:53:36.339]  Yeah, and she's got it.
[02:53:36.379 --> 02:53:38.480]  She's doing some weird stuff happens there.
[02:53:38.500 --> 02:53:42.562]  And then she's gonna end up like it's the crazy it gets dark.
[02:53:43.002 --> 02:53:45.583]  And then she does this kind of thing where she jumps.
[02:53:46.263 --> 02:53:49.504]  And it's like I'm watching this going this is really weird.
[02:53:50.124 --> 02:53:53.425]  And this is when I started going, Oh, dude, there's something to this.
[02:53:53.725 --> 02:54:02.573]   And if you study Gaga, If you understand who Gaga is, Gaga is Pluto and he is the messenger for Saturn.
[02:54:02.993 --> 02:54:07.994]  And here it is, Lucifer descending from heaven down, down to hell.
[02:54:08.034 --> 02:54:11.735]  Here we go, which looks like some weird, itsy bitsy spider, right?
[02:54:12.155 --> 02:54:12.915]  It's so weird.
[02:54:13.035 --> 02:54:17.216]  And then you start to look around her and it is nothing but pentagrams.
[02:54:17.696 --> 02:54:42.781]   And then the way that they light the, the audience, it's all red looking like flames and Listen, man, I grew up, I was one of those people, the generation Xers who saw all the Roman Catholic Church stuff that was with, you know, the priest and the pedophilia and made me disconnect from God, which I think was a giant part.
[02:54:43.579 --> 02:54:44.639]  Of why they did that.
[02:54:45.039 --> 02:54:55.922]  If they do it in Hollywood, they do it in Washington, D.C., why wouldn't they do it at levels of power, put corruptible people in that they eventually out once they've served their use and make you, demoralize you.
[02:54:56.142 --> 02:55:08.785]  And I have friends of mine that I know have real problems with God because of things they've happened, but also that giant, giant pedophile scandal that's happened over decades.
[02:55:09.953 --> 02:55:10.794]  And here we go.
[02:55:11.074 --> 02:55:25.524]  So the very interesting thing is like when we look at all this, this satanic symbolism in Lady Gaga stuff, and we bring it up here on this show, we have people who have eager ears and want to hear it, but you bring it up to everybody else, they start talking about satanic panic.
[02:55:25.805 --> 02:55:27.566]  They're like, oh, dude, satanic panic.
[02:55:27.606 --> 02:55:35.892]  And what they don't understand is that was done on purpose for when they would start getting more and more bold with what they're doing today.
[02:55:36.412 --> 02:55:38.714]  So that's why they create satanic panic.
[02:55:38.734 --> 02:55:48.482]  They tell you all this just a bunch of cuckoo crazy Christians going nuts trying to find a reason to get upset and reality all that stuff was real.
[02:55:49.043 --> 02:55:50.264]  It all really happened.
[02:55:50.684 --> 02:55:58.250]  It was just a giant psyop ran on us so that today they could use as excuse not to believe what we're talking about here today.
[02:55:59.992 --> 02:56:07.526]   Yeah, well, A couple people that really promoted the Satanic Panic were Geraldo and Oprah.
[02:56:07.546 --> 02:56:12.731]  If you remember, Oprah would have a lot of people on that were both kooky and real Satanists.
[02:56:12.771 --> 02:56:19.737]  She had Michael Aquino on back in the day, which he actually was a Satanist, and the stuff that he was involved in was legit Satanism.
[02:56:20.177 --> 02:56:31.224]   So they would have the real stuff, and then they would bring in this kooky, crazy stuff on purpose to make it look crazy, I think, to cover for the real stuff that was actually going on even in the
[02:56:31.224 --> 02:56:31.863]  80s.
[02:56:31.863 --> 02:56:34.824]  Yeah, 100%.
[02:56:34.824 --> 02:56:39.744]   And like dude, I get in this thing where it's like, for me at the darkest levels, I think
[02:56:39.744 --> 02:56:43.664]  it's like Moloch worship and Black Cube.
[02:56:43.988 --> 02:56:44.968]  They might be all the same.
[02:56:45.108 --> 02:56:47.270]  Kronos, that might be the same person.
[02:56:47.790 --> 02:56:51.292]  But they created this thing called Satanism, right?
[02:56:51.952 --> 02:57:12.561]   And Satan exists, but like the form of Satanism, which I believe this is pushing, is meant to like just get like Goth guys who want to hook up with, you know, fat, you know, like Dungeons & Dragons dudes who just want to hook up with fat goth chicks and just something cool that, you know, that cool down when they go and watch the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
[02:57:12.902 --> 02:57:15.484]  So, like, you look at this guy's eyebrows.
[02:57:15.524 --> 02:57:17.506]  He's obviously a LARP.
[02:57:17.526 --> 02:57:20.129]  And I'm not saying he doesn't participate in it.
[02:57:20.649 --> 02:57:22.890]  Like, he obviously did, if you know his history.
[02:57:23.250 --> 02:57:30.573]  It's very dark, but it's being presented as this kind of cosplay weirdo thing that will piss off your parents.
[02:57:31.253 --> 02:57:39.876]  And, you know, but once you start to get into that, you start to see darker and darker and darker, and it gets really bad for you because you're going against God.
[02:57:39.956 --> 02:57:41.217]  And that's my honest belief.
[02:57:43.231 --> 02:57:52.694]  Yeah, in the case of Aquino, I mean, he had, you know, quite a few books detailing what to actually do to practice real Satanism and was involved in quite a few scandals.
[02:57:53.315 --> 02:57:56.856]  The Presidio scandal, where he was investigated for abuse.
[02:57:57.396 --> 02:58:03.458]   So, I mean, there was a lot going on beyond just the external costume larpsphere-like Yes!
[02:58:03.277 --> 02:58:07.437]   Like Anton LaVey, and I mean, you know, Aquino wanted to make it more Syria.
[02:58:07.437 --> 02:58:09.116]  He thought LaVey was too cartoonish.
[02:58:09.116 --> 02:58:14.157]   So again, yeah, there's people that really, and he was writing high level psyops papers
[02:58:14.157 --> 02:58:18.437]   for the military in terms of their doctrine of psychological warfare.
[02:58:18.437 --> 02:58:21.277]   So he's not some goofball, even though he looks like a goofball,
[02:58:21.277 --> 02:58:24.316]  he actually looks like Bela Lugosi or something.
[02:58:24.316 --> 02:58:27.757]   Like he looks silly, not LaVey, but I'm talking about Aquino.
[02:58:27.757 --> 02:58:31.037]  But no, they were really engaging in this.
[02:58:31.037 --> 02:58:35.356]   In fact, he was even alleged to have been connected to the Franklin coverup,
[02:58:35.356 --> 02:58:38.557]  the case of Paul Bonacci, famous...
[02:58:38.837 --> 02:58:43.337]  abuse victims related to the Franklin cover-up.
[02:58:43.337 --> 02:58:49.176]   So you had Nick Bryant on, I had an interview with Nick Bryant recently.
[02:58:49.176 --> 02:58:53.057]   So you know this as well that there's a close connection between these models of
[02:58:53.057 --> 02:58:58.438]   what you see with Franklin cover-up, with Epstein, as well as what we're talking
[02:58:58.438 --> 02:59:02.297]   about in the broader sphere of the rest of entertainment and the Roman Catholic Church.
[02:59:02.629 --> 02:59:06.890]  We talked about this being institutional capture a few interviews back.
[02:59:07.851 --> 02:59:08.591]  What do you think about that?
[02:59:08.631 --> 02:59:09.391]  Is that what's going on here?
[02:59:09.411 --> 02:59:13.813]  They're capturing institutions so that they control everybody in society in general?
[02:59:15.285 --> 02:59:31.596]  I mean, you could look at all the Abrahamic religions and there seems to be this influx now of dark arts, symbolism, I mean, whether it's Mecca going around the black cube, the question of the star, David, where's it come from?
[02:59:31.636 --> 02:59:32.937]  What is it actually?
[02:59:32.997 --> 02:59:38.060]  And then everything involved with, you know, I know you're Roman Catholic and I respect Catholics.
[02:59:38.080 --> 02:59:40.242]  There's something about the Vatican that's just as creepy, man.
[02:59:40.282 --> 02:59:40.522]  I'm not.
[02:59:40.602 --> 02:59:41.122]  I thought you were.
[02:59:41.142 --> 02:59:41.583]  I thought you were.
[02:59:41.803 --> 02:59:43.064]  Oh, well, you're Orthodox.
[02:59:43.104 --> 02:59:43.304]  Yeah.
[02:59:45.567 --> 02:59:46.372]  Right, we get back from the break.
[02:59:51.149 --> 02:59:55.390]  You can see here the Great Awakening orbiting the Great Reset.
[02:59:56.110 --> 03:00:05.854]  Although the depopulation systems of the Great Reset are not yet fully operational, the Great Reset does have a strong conspiracy network.
[03:00:06.294 --> 03:00:12.176]  It is protected by a satanic shield which can be disabled by the Great Awakening.
[03:00:12.596 --> 03:00:18.798]  The Great Reset must be deactivated if any victory for humanity is to be accomplished.
[03:00:19.838 --> 03:00:33.886]  Once the Great Awakening deactivates the shield, InfoWars.com forward slash show will cover the truth while Info Warriors fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the Great Reset.
[03:00:34.387 --> 03:00:38.129]  Alex Jones has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.
[03:00:38.469 --> 03:00:43.552]  Get a signed copy of the Great Awakening today at InfoWars.com.
[03:00:46.676 --> 03:00:48.277]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:48.297 --> 03:00:50.437]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jason Alastos.
[03:00:50.457 --> 03:00:52.178]  We've got Sam Tripoli with us.
[03:00:52.218 --> 03:01:01.021]  He is the host of Broken Simulation, Cash Daddies, Conspiracy Social Club, Tenfold Hat, Zero... I mean, I can't even... It just keeps going.
[03:01:01.081 --> 03:01:02.001]  I'm a crazy person.
[03:01:02.021 --> 03:01:04.102]  The rest of the segment... I'm a crazy person.
[03:01:05.342 --> 03:01:06.562]  Head on over to samtripoli.com.
[03:01:06.582 --> 03:01:08.383]  You can follow him on all the social media outlets.
[03:01:08.403 --> 03:01:12.884]  Sam, I know you've got some dates coming up stand-up-wise in terms of Bakersfield.
[03:01:12.905 --> 03:01:14.125]  Do you want to tell us about those dates?
[03:01:14.898 --> 03:01:22.162]  Yes, I'm going to be with the legendary Brian Callen next weekend in Bakersfield and in Huntington Beach.
[03:01:22.182 --> 03:01:28.305]  And then I'm proud to announce my new special, Quiet, is being filmed March 3rd.
[03:01:28.445 --> 03:01:33.148]  That's right, March 3rd at the Bourbon Room in LA.
[03:01:33.268 --> 03:01:34.249]  Grab tickets now.
[03:01:34.409 --> 03:01:39.151]  All tickets, all the money from the tickets go to produce the special.
[03:01:39.191 --> 03:01:40.352]  I'm not making any money off it.
[03:01:40.792 --> 03:01:42.873]  So, uh, I just want to put out a great special.
[03:01:42.893 --> 03:01:44.134]  I got an hour of power.
[03:01:44.434 --> 03:01:47.536]  And then, I just want you, if you get a chance, check out my new Rumble show.
[03:01:47.936 --> 03:01:55.840]  It's called, uh, Doomscrolling, and I basically break down the best conspiracy videos from YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.
[03:01:55.860 --> 03:01:57.341]  So, uh, I love doing the show.
[03:01:57.601 --> 03:02:00.102]  We've got some huge numbers, and I'm very blessed.
[03:02:01.663 --> 03:02:04.004]  Am I too serious on this show, Jay?
[03:02:04.585 --> 03:02:05.705]  Am I being too serious?
[03:02:06.426 --> 03:02:07.466]  Am I being too serious?
[03:02:07.486 --> 03:02:08.847]  Should I be wackier?
[03:02:10.754 --> 03:02:16.495]  Well, you are a comedian, so that's up to your professional purview.
[03:02:16.595 --> 03:02:18.335]  You can decide how you want to be.
[03:02:18.355 --> 03:02:20.896]  You can identify as whatever you want to identify as, Sam.
[03:02:21.176 --> 03:02:21.856]  I love that.
[03:02:22.116 --> 03:02:22.856]  I love that.
[03:02:23.116 --> 03:02:24.517]  That's great, dude.
[03:02:25.037 --> 03:02:27.497]  I'm going to identify as successful.
[03:02:27.577 --> 03:02:28.177]  Can I do that?
[03:02:28.197 --> 03:02:29.258]  Am I allowed?
[03:02:29.498 --> 03:02:30.258]  Am I allowed?
[03:02:30.518 --> 03:02:30.818]  Okay.
[03:02:32.098 --> 03:02:33.478]  I'm going to identify as Sam Tripoli.
[03:02:33.518 --> 03:02:34.839]  What do you think of that?
[03:02:34.859 --> 03:02:35.559]  Nah, dude, do it.
[03:02:35.639 --> 03:02:36.439]  Good luck with it.
[03:02:36.519 --> 03:02:37.019]  Enjoy it.
[03:02:37.600 --> 03:02:39.522]  It's like when somebody tries to steal your credit.
[03:02:39.702 --> 03:02:41.264]  You're like, oh, dude, you want this credit?
[03:02:41.364 --> 03:02:41.824]  Enjoy it.
[03:02:43.626 --> 03:02:48.411]  I do impersonate you a lot, though, so I don't know if you know that, but... Oh, dude, I've never learned impersonation of me.
[03:02:48.551 --> 03:02:49.592]  Please, can I see it?
[03:02:49.912 --> 03:02:50.573]  Please, God.
[03:02:50.593 --> 03:02:51.134]  I'll do it later.
[03:02:51.154 --> 03:02:51.414]  Give me that.
[03:02:51.434 --> 03:02:52.055]  I'll do it later.
[03:02:52.095 --> 03:02:52.275]  Look.
[03:02:52.495 --> 03:02:55.238]  Okay, let's get back to the big send-off.
[03:02:55.258 --> 03:03:00.403]  I want to remind everybody that I will be live as well in Hollywood.
[03:03:01.193 --> 03:03:05.357]  March 15th, with the great Jamie Kennedy, we'll be doing a five-hour event.
[03:03:05.757 --> 03:03:07.839]  Jamie will be the headliner doing some stand-up.
[03:03:08.139 --> 03:03:11.181]  I will be doing a bit of stand-up myself, which is a lot of impressions.
[03:03:11.822 --> 03:03:16.105]  My wife, Jamie Hanshaw, not Kennedy, will be doing a talk on Hollywood occultism.
[03:03:16.165 --> 03:03:19.428]  I'll be doing a talk on geopolitics and conspiracy.
[03:03:19.468 --> 03:03:20.769]  So it's a big five-hour event.
[03:03:20.809 --> 03:03:22.811]  Go get your tickets at the top of my Twitter.
[03:03:23.491 --> 03:03:24.432]  It's pinned at the top.
[03:03:24.532 --> 03:03:26.013]  It's the Jamie Kennedy event.
[03:03:26.093 --> 03:03:27.154]  So that's going to be March 15th.
[03:03:27.194 --> 03:03:28.455]  Please remember, get those tickets, guys.
[03:03:30.482 --> 03:03:32.763]  Go check out, by the way, Sam's podcast.
[03:03:32.923 --> 03:03:34.965]  Again, I've gone pretty deep.
[03:03:35.005 --> 03:03:36.045]  He goes deep, homeboy.
[03:03:36.065 --> 03:03:40.547]  I've gone deep on a lot of Broken Sims, a lot of Temple Hats.
[03:03:40.748 --> 03:03:42.488]  I mean, there's a lot of great information there.
[03:03:42.568 --> 03:03:49.052]  We were talking about, before the break, this idea of institutional capture, compromising people at the top.
[03:03:50.252 --> 03:03:53.594]  Sam accused me of being a pedophile Roman Catholic.
[03:03:53.934 --> 03:03:55.255]  I said, no way, dude.
[03:03:55.655 --> 03:03:56.876]  I forgot, I forgot, I forgot.
[03:03:57.805 --> 03:04:00.267]  I'm an Orthodox, that's okay, that's okay.
[03:04:00.407 --> 03:04:03.248]  We don't believe in the Roman Catholic people stuff, but that's okay.
[03:04:03.409 --> 03:04:06.771]  Look, we've seen the Pope get co-opted.
[03:04:06.811 --> 03:04:11.894]  I mean, the Popes that are basically saying all of Klaus Schwab's lines about the New World Order.
[03:04:11.914 --> 03:04:15.116]  We just had the World Government Summit that met this week.
[03:04:15.136 --> 03:04:18.218]  A couple weeks ago it was Davos, same stuff.
[03:04:18.718 --> 03:04:25.002]  A World Government Summit just has a little bit more of a Muslim, Arabic, you know, kebab flavor to it than Davos.
[03:04:25.726 --> 03:04:35.893]  Why are they coming out, Sam, in full, like, just disclosure, telling us everything about, yeah, okay, there's a push for a world government, so what?
[03:04:35.933 --> 03:04:37.074]  If you don't like it, you're a bigot.
[03:04:38.095 --> 03:05:13.277]   Because they've been waiting for this forever, and the time is now, and it could be about something bigger, and the universe, and calendars, and all that stuff, but something is, like, get it out now, let's see if we can control what is happening, and I think I think what is happening is the most amazing awakening of all time and it could get very scary and it could get very like your anxiety can shoot through the roof but I think this is just what you have to go through in order to get to the other side which is like the end of this parasitic demonic group that's been running you know our world for the last
[03:05:14.017 --> 03:05:15.859]  Hundreds of years or thousands of years.
[03:05:16.179 --> 03:05:17.059]  And I think it's over.
[03:05:17.140 --> 03:05:25.065]  And I think they know it and they're trying to do whatever they can to control it or to act like they are in control of the change that is coming.
[03:05:25.626 --> 03:05:26.586]  And I think we win.
[03:05:26.626 --> 03:05:27.787]  God wins all the time.
[03:05:28.288 --> 03:05:29.529]  And I think they know it.
[03:05:30.149 --> 03:05:31.210]  People lose hope.
[03:05:33.111 --> 03:05:35.613]  Klaus Schwab may be the most powerful guy in the world.
[03:05:35.693 --> 03:05:36.434]  I don't think he is.
[03:05:36.454 --> 03:05:37.234]  We know his name.
[03:05:37.294 --> 03:05:38.815]  He's probably not the most powerful.
[03:05:40.174 --> 03:05:43.916]  You know, even Klaus Schwab is a speck of dirt to the universe.
[03:05:44.197 --> 03:05:46.038]  You're not bigger than the universe.
[03:05:46.058 --> 03:05:47.339]  The universe has rules.
[03:05:47.399 --> 03:05:48.639]  God has laws.
[03:05:49.100 --> 03:05:55.324]  And if you don't follow these laws, you know, the universe starts to bring the hammer down on you.
[03:05:55.344 --> 03:05:56.865]  And Klaus Schwab will get it too.
[03:05:56.905 --> 03:05:57.905]  They're all going to get it.
[03:05:57.925 --> 03:06:00.127]  Because at the end of the day, it's all about love.
[03:06:00.167 --> 03:06:03.549]  And if you're not giving it away and helping others, you're taking it.
[03:06:03.629 --> 03:06:05.030]  And that's not how the universe works.
[03:06:05.450 --> 03:06:07.030]  So, I have a lot of hope.
[03:06:07.090 --> 03:06:10.151]  I get very nervous about what's coming, but I'm all about chaos.
[03:06:10.531 --> 03:06:11.091]  I love it.
[03:06:11.331 --> 03:06:13.312]  Makes my job easier to talk about it.
[03:06:13.332 --> 03:06:17.073]  Uh, I, you know, it's just, we've been right more than we've been wrong, Jay.
[03:06:17.413 --> 03:06:18.953]  We, you know, we wouldn't be doing our shows.
[03:06:18.973 --> 03:06:21.014]  It's all about chaos!
[03:06:21.354 --> 03:06:21.554]  Yeah.
[03:06:21.574 --> 03:06:27.595]  We wouldn't be doing this show, you wouldn't be doing this show, you wouldn't be on Alex's channel if you were wrong all the time.
[03:06:27.875 --> 03:06:31.156]  You're way more right than you're wrong, if you're ever wrong.
[03:06:31.496 --> 03:06:34.257]  So that's why you're here, and that's why we're, I think we're winning.
[03:06:35.865 --> 03:06:41.570]  That brings me to what they want to bring in, which is, you know, the full technocratic order.
[03:06:41.610 --> 03:06:46.894]  We've talked about that endlessly, but everybody's talking about what the event is going to be.
[03:06:47.095 --> 03:06:54.821]  And there was an email that went out to everybody on YouTube that you can't talk about an upcoming sensitive event.
[03:06:54.881 --> 03:07:00.306]  We had the House Intel Committee a couple of days ago say there's a big national security threat event.
[03:07:01.156 --> 03:07:04.159]  And we're all kind of batting around different possibilities.
[03:07:04.239 --> 03:07:05.340]  Is it coup part two?
[03:07:05.420 --> 03:07:06.681]  Is it economic collapse?
[03:07:06.741 --> 03:07:07.441]  World War?
[03:07:07.561 --> 03:07:08.142]  EMP?
[03:07:08.182 --> 03:07:08.642]  Fake flag?
[03:07:09.243 --> 03:07:10.283]  What do you think's coming?
[03:07:10.303 --> 03:07:12.665]  You've had a lot of great guests on talking about these topics.
[03:07:12.785 --> 03:07:15.127]  What's the likely scenarios in your mind, Sam?
[03:07:16.388 --> 03:07:20.932]  I think you're going to see some kind of real chaos on soil.
[03:07:21.721 --> 03:07:22.302]  On our soil.
[03:07:22.983 --> 03:07:23.823]  I think that's coming.
[03:07:24.344 --> 03:07:26.927]  And I went on Joe Rogan, and I've talked about it before.
[03:07:27.287 --> 03:07:31.972]  Before everybody was paying attention to the immigration stuff, I was like, this is being done on purpose.
[03:07:32.313 --> 03:07:33.834]  This is chaos.
[03:07:34.034 --> 03:07:38.619]  They are losing LA, San Francisco, Philadelphia, New York, and Chicago.
[03:07:38.900 --> 03:07:42.544]  They cannot, the demons, can't lose those cities.
[03:07:43.184 --> 03:07:45.345]  And still be able to act like they've won anything.
[03:07:45.385 --> 03:07:49.206]  So they have to control, create maximum chaos, bro!
[03:07:49.287 --> 03:07:59.811]  And that's why I'm taking Krav Maga, Jiu Jitsu, learning to shoot a gun, starting a militia, getting it going, racking and rolling, because, you know, I mean, chaos is coming, dude!
[03:08:00.211 --> 03:08:01.411]  Buckle up, buttercup!
[03:08:01.731 --> 03:08:05.173]  And, you know, I just think people gotta, like, prepare.
[03:08:05.433 --> 03:08:05.853]  That's it.
[03:08:06.013 --> 03:08:06.954]  I mean, something's coming.
[03:08:07.314 --> 03:08:14.140]   And, you know, what we've done to the Middle East, through weapons of mass destruction and all that lie.
[03:08:14.140 --> 03:08:16.699]  There's also energy and karma with that.
[03:08:16.699 --> 03:08:21.740]   And you can't do that to the rest of the world and treat people like that and not expect a
[03:08:21.740 --> 03:08:27.819]   karma blowback. And that might be why we're in a lot of chaos right now. But I also believe, dude,
[03:08:27.819 --> 03:08:32.540]   you know, you hear Rogan talk about this a lot, about how like the death of every empire,
[03:08:32.540 --> 03:08:35.020]  they start getting concerned with gender wars.
[03:08:35.215 --> 03:08:42.551]  Well, what I would respectfully push back against my friend on that is that that is just a smokescreen.
[03:08:43.135 --> 03:08:55.859]  What's really happening is you start to see the gender stuff when it becomes more and more obvious that the elites are pilfering our natural given laws and wealth and are destroying our families.
[03:08:55.879 --> 03:09:04.782]  So once that starts to happen, okay, then they start sending out the trans soldiers and all the antifas and the BLM.
[03:09:05.302 --> 03:09:11.523]  And all that crazy stuff in our schools, so we don't pay attention to the giant looting that is going on at the top.
[03:09:11.764 --> 03:09:16.145]  Because you cannot have a structure if you don't have a base to that structure.
[03:09:16.245 --> 03:09:22.166]  Once the base is weak and the whole structure collapses, and they don't want us to see that, this is a controlled demolition.
[03:09:22.706 --> 03:09:31.008]  Somebody put this out the other day, about like, if the Ukraine needs money, why don't they create a Federal Reserve, and why don't they just print the money for it?
[03:09:31.087 --> 03:09:37.708]   But they'll never do it because then they can't destroy our monetary system and bring in you know
[03:09:37.708 --> 03:09:43.237]   socialism and ultimately Martial law that's what they want. So they have to destroy
[03:09:43.237 --> 03:09:51.007]   our dollar to get that going Yeah, I mean the the only way to bring in the CBDC
[03:09:51.007 --> 03:09:56.567]   Global currency that they want is to implode the existing system
[03:09:56.598 --> 03:10:07.749]  We know that before COVID, a lot of the high level people in the medical industry were talking about, we need to blow up the existing system to justify bringing in the new system.
[03:10:07.769 --> 03:10:09.371]  So I kind of think that's what they're dealing with.
[03:10:09.591 --> 03:10:11.292]  The dollar trying to destroy it.
[03:10:12.952 --> 03:10:17.293]  Maybe the answer is something like Bitcoin that's not centralized.
[03:10:17.413 --> 03:10:19.614]  Any of the centralized cryptos, I think, are dangerous.
[03:10:19.994 --> 03:10:21.835]  You talk about that on Cash Daddies quite a bit.
[03:10:21.875 --> 03:10:23.255]  Look, we're going to go to a break.
[03:10:23.395 --> 03:10:29.137]  I'm with Sam Tripoli, the most woke comedian, and this is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:10:29.237 --> 03:10:29.777]  Stay where you are.
[03:10:30.555 --> 03:10:31.656]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:10:31.677 --> 03:10:32.878]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:10:32.898 --> 03:10:35.641]  Today's analysis, we're talking with comedian Sam Tripoli.
[03:10:35.741 --> 03:10:37.103]  I was joking when I called him woke.
[03:10:37.123 --> 03:10:38.825]  He's not woke in the bad sense.
[03:10:38.845 --> 03:10:39.927]  He's woke in the good sense.
[03:10:40.848 --> 03:10:48.549]   And we are getting into the topic of Derailing the election, big false flags, big events in 2024.
[03:10:49.630 --> 03:10:53.554]  Is that the key reason for the big coming event in 2024, Sam?
[03:10:53.574 --> 03:11:00.022]  Do you think it's to do another election derailing like last time and make sure that it's going to be who?
[03:11:00.502 --> 03:11:01.063]  Big Mike?
[03:11:01.143 --> 03:11:03.466]  I mean, what do you think is going on with this election?
[03:11:04.777 --> 03:11:06.078]  I mean, they are setting it up.
[03:11:06.598 --> 03:11:08.439]  They are letting you know.
[03:11:08.639 --> 03:11:11.941]  Now they have Jon Stewart openly talking about his age.
[03:11:12.001 --> 03:11:12.881]  He's too old.
[03:11:13.181 --> 03:11:15.202]  He shouldn't be going running.
[03:11:15.563 --> 03:11:16.383]  So they're setting it up.
[03:11:16.443 --> 03:11:17.904]  The question is, who's it going to be?
[03:11:17.924 --> 03:11:20.265]  You know, everyone's talking Big Mike.
[03:11:20.725 --> 03:11:22.226]  Everybody's talking Gavin Newsom.
[03:11:23.321 --> 03:11:27.342]  Uh, I mean, nobody's talking Hillary Clinton, who's real quiet, man.
[03:11:27.382 --> 03:11:29.283]  Like, real quiet.
[03:11:29.803 --> 03:11:37.865]  I can see her just slipping out of nowhere to get any kind of, like, bad energy her way, just step in at the last second before anyone can do anything.
[03:11:37.925 --> 03:11:38.865]  So, we'll see.
[03:11:38.905 --> 03:11:40.725]  But that is 100% what's going on.
[03:11:40.764 --> 03:11:51.123]   They have to control these five major libertarian, you know, like, libtard cities so that they
[03:11:51.123 --> 03:11:54.404]  can control the perception that they want.
[03:11:54.404 --> 03:11:59.045]   Because if they lose those cities, there's no way they can lie to us that they won.
[03:11:59.045 --> 03:12:01.323]  They can't rig the election without those cities.
[03:12:01.323 --> 03:12:03.443]  So they have to cause major chaos.
[03:12:03.443 --> 03:12:05.123]  And it's going to happen.
[03:12:05.123 --> 03:12:11.483]   Now if you got to take a look at what happened in New York recently, they had an election
[03:12:11.483 --> 03:12:17.483]   and they gave New York the decision to choose between a Democrat and a foreign, someone
[03:12:17.483 --> 03:12:21.644]  who's obviously a dual citizen foreigner, okay?
[03:12:21.833 --> 03:12:22.974]  And they picked a Democrat.
[03:12:23.514 --> 03:12:26.237]  That's all they keep voting for, are Democrats!
[03:12:26.877 --> 03:12:29.900]  Are you talking about Michelle Obama, dual citizen?
[03:12:30.020 --> 03:12:31.802]  She's a man and woman?
[03:12:31.842 --> 03:12:36.586]  No, no, no, I'm talking about, they recently, I think, had a Senate.
[03:12:36.666 --> 03:12:39.969]  George Santos, his seat they gave up.
[03:12:40.029 --> 03:12:43.812]  And by the way, he's killing it on cameos right now.
[03:12:45.874 --> 03:12:53.619]  They gave up his seat and an Israeli woman ran for it who couldn't barely speak English, and a Democrat won.
[03:12:53.699 --> 03:13:13.956]   And now you're just voting for the same policy, people who make the same policies, who keep running your city into ground because the theory The theory of what a Republican could do is worse than what is actually happening on the ground because most of these liberals are very high, you know, rich.
[03:13:14.096 --> 03:13:22.704]  They're from an upper level of the financial world and they are insulated from the results of their voting.
[03:13:24.113 --> 03:13:25.654]  And they'll never stop voting for that.
[03:13:25.934 --> 03:13:31.837]  We'll never save San Francisco, or LA, or Chicago, because rich kids keep voting against their father.
[03:13:32.377 --> 03:13:33.258]  Aw, the meanie!
[03:13:33.278 --> 03:13:38.941]  I can't get the meanie in, even though everyone's getting mugged, and everyone's getting robbed, and all these stores are closing.
[03:13:39.181 --> 03:13:46.665]  They're still gonna keep voting Democrat because they can't vote for someone who might, their dad or their grandpa might like, God forbid.
[03:13:48.666 --> 03:13:49.907]  What about my wife, Michael?
[03:13:50.707 --> 03:13:51.988]  Zam, I don't know if you know about my wife, Michael.
[03:13:52.922 --> 03:13:54.884]  I mean, those are some shoulders.
[03:13:55.804 --> 03:13:56.685]  You're the best, bro.
[03:13:56.725 --> 03:13:58.086]  You are the best impersonator.
[03:13:58.546 --> 03:14:02.169]  Yeah, I mean, those are some big shoulders and some fat hands, okay?
[03:14:02.669 --> 03:14:06.512]  Big Mike is, I believe that wholeheartedly.
[03:14:06.852 --> 03:14:10.715]  It's so funny because all we're getting told are that, and I have a lot of trans friends.
[03:14:10.735 --> 03:14:11.395]  I don't care, man.
[03:14:11.435 --> 03:14:11.936]  Live your life.
[03:14:11.956 --> 03:14:12.876]  Just leave kids alone.
[03:14:12.916 --> 03:14:13.657]  That's my whole thing.
[03:14:14.157 --> 03:14:27.034]   And if you study Obamacare, There were no of these centers to give kids sex changes before Obamacare.
[03:14:27.154 --> 03:14:28.876]  After Obamacare, over a hundred.
[03:14:28.976 --> 03:14:31.800]  So she's gonna get all the crap she can get, okay?
[03:14:32.060 --> 03:14:37.006]  I'm sorry, you brought this in, now you're gonna feel the consequences of your actions.
[03:14:38.729 --> 03:14:40.490]  You've been telling me trans are unicorns.
[03:14:40.510 --> 03:14:44.091]  Why are you mad that I'm saying that we had a black unicorn in the White House?
[03:14:44.331 --> 03:14:45.411]  You should be celebrating it.
[03:14:45.431 --> 03:14:52.613]  Because the truth is, you really don't think they're normal, and you don't think they're just trying to live their lives.
[03:14:53.073 --> 03:14:55.834]  And secretly, you think they're mentally ill.
[03:14:55.954 --> 03:14:57.275]  And that's why you get upset.
[03:14:57.615 --> 03:15:06.758]  It's like when the old joke was like, oh, you look like, who's the big fat chick that was singing forever?
[03:15:08.869 --> 03:15:09.989]  No, no, that's hilarious.
[03:15:10.210 --> 03:15:14.971]  But the big fat chick that was singing, you'd say, oh, you look like her, and chicks would get mad.
[03:15:15.011 --> 03:15:16.792]  Well, you were just telling me she was beautiful.
[03:15:16.832 --> 03:15:17.712]  What are you talking about?
[03:15:18.053 --> 03:15:19.533]  You get to find out the truth about them.
[03:15:20.273 --> 03:15:21.494]  Lizzo, Tessa Holiday.
[03:15:21.514 --> 03:15:23.695]  There we go, Lizzo, dude.
[03:15:24.055 --> 03:15:27.596]  If you're like, oh, you're so beautiful like Lizzo, chicks would lose their mind.
[03:15:27.856 --> 03:15:31.398]  But you're telling me she's beautiful and she should be on the cover of Sports Illustrated.
[03:15:31.698 --> 03:15:32.798]  You know you're full of it.
[03:15:33.038 --> 03:15:34.579]  You're just virtual signaling.
[03:15:34.619 --> 03:15:35.019]  That's it.
[03:15:36.039 --> 03:15:36.480]  Exactly.
[03:15:36.520 --> 03:15:40.245]  Now, you're a California dude, so, I mean, a lot of people are talking about Gavin Newsom.
[03:15:40.385 --> 03:15:47.475]  I mean, has he had- he looks like he's had a horrible track record, and he's a communist, uh, demon, right?
[03:15:48.456 --> 03:15:48.937]  The worst!
[03:15:48.957 --> 03:15:49.337]  He is the worst!
[03:15:53.146 --> 03:15:53.606]  He's aware.
[03:15:53.666 --> 03:15:58.067]  I mean, you have Bill Maher trying to call what he did to California dandruff.
[03:15:58.307 --> 03:16:03.228]  That's how, like, detached from reality Bill Maher is.
[03:16:03.948 --> 03:16:11.649]  And so, it's like, what he did was absolutely destroy generational businesses, family businesses that would be passed down from generation to generation.
[03:16:11.889 --> 03:16:13.150]  We lost a lot of those.
[03:16:13.630 --> 03:16:15.250]  Suicides, drug overdose.
[03:16:15.830 --> 03:16:25.731]   And if you ever watched the The documentary, Capitalist Conspiracy, they break down exactly what's happening.
[03:16:25.771 --> 03:16:27.772]  It's called Pressure from Above, Pressure from Below.
[03:16:28.232 --> 03:16:33.315]  The reason they released all the criminals is because they want crime to go up.
[03:16:33.795 --> 03:16:37.817]  And the reason they're not doing anything about the crime is because they want to break your spirit.
[03:16:38.197 --> 03:16:41.859]  And that's why they arrest you when you try to defend yourself.
[03:16:42.180 --> 03:16:57.534]   They want you out of options, so you demand that daddy government come and Steals all your God-given rights and becomes your nanny and can spy on you, enter your house whenever they want, tell you what you can or cannot do.
[03:16:57.814 --> 03:16:59.336]  And that is the goal of everything.
[03:16:59.496 --> 03:17:02.059]  And Gavin Newsom is pushing that agenda forward.
[03:17:03.729 --> 03:17:04.389]  Yeah, I remember.
[03:17:04.409 --> 03:17:13.091]  I mean, I've been coming to California at least once a year the last four or five years, and I've noticed a steady decline, especially pre and post COVID, right?
[03:17:13.131 --> 03:17:15.272]  I mean, it's like so bad, pretty rough.
[03:17:15.692 --> 03:17:16.772]  I mean, it's pretty rough.
[03:17:16.872 --> 03:17:20.093]  I mean, not everywhere, but a lot of places are pretty bad.
[03:17:20.173 --> 03:17:25.374]  And I always see California is kind of like it's a military industrial complex test bed.
[03:17:25.414 --> 03:17:28.855]  It's like a test tube for the rest of the country 20 or 30 years later.
[03:17:28.875 --> 03:17:28.955]  Yeah.
[03:17:32.383 --> 03:17:38.905]  And basically what happened was it used to be California would set the trends and it would slowly move itself to the middle of the country.
[03:17:38.985 --> 03:17:42.687]  New York and California would push out all the new cool stuff.
[03:17:42.747 --> 03:17:44.927]  And now all the outlaws have left LA.
[03:17:45.107 --> 03:17:45.848]  All the outlaws!
[03:17:46.208 --> 03:17:47.428]  There's no outlaws left.
[03:17:47.688 --> 03:17:48.329]  Me, maybe.
[03:17:48.409 --> 03:17:48.869]  That's it.
[03:17:49.409 --> 03:17:51.830]  Everybody else has moved to Texas or Florida.
[03:17:52.250 --> 03:17:58.452]  And what you have here is just a bunch of rich kids who just don't want to come off as anything other than woke.
[03:17:59.873 --> 03:18:02.136]  I don't know how we're going to save LA.
[03:18:02.156 --> 03:18:12.066]  I don't know how we're going to save San Francisco when you only have rich kids who are voting all the time and they just cannot not vote for the party that's put them in this situation.
[03:18:15.535 --> 03:18:17.876]  We got a few minutes left here as we close it out.
[03:18:19.057 --> 03:18:20.977]  You were on Rogan again not too long ago.
[03:18:20.997 --> 03:18:22.978]  A few months back you were back on Rogan.
[03:18:24.279 --> 03:18:25.919]  That must have been pretty wild.
[03:18:25.939 --> 03:18:27.080]  That's a huge audience.
[03:18:27.140 --> 03:18:28.701]  I know you got some good exposure from that.
[03:18:28.721 --> 03:18:29.641]  Did you have a good conversation?
[03:18:30.811 --> 03:18:32.732]  I always have good conversations with Rogan.
[03:18:32.812 --> 03:18:35.153]  It's almost too good a conversation.
[03:18:35.233 --> 03:18:40.275]  Sometimes, back in the day, I would like to go too deep, and I feel like I got a little weird there.
[03:18:40.756 --> 03:18:43.997]  But Joe Rogan, I love him.
[03:18:44.637 --> 03:18:45.558]  He's a good friend of mine.
[03:18:45.578 --> 03:18:56.963]  I've watched him go from this guy who was doing Fear Factor to having this great, incredible podcast that is helping get information out to everybody.
[03:18:57.023 --> 03:18:58.804]  And I know the man, and he's a great man.
[03:18:59.364 --> 03:19:00.265]  And it's a blessing.
[03:19:00.465 --> 03:19:08.491]  And you know, what's really crazy is when you see people clip up that interview and everyone's like, dude, this guy called this, this guy called that.
[03:19:08.711 --> 03:19:09.252]  Exactly.
[03:19:09.372 --> 03:19:09.812]  It's great.
[03:19:10.412 --> 03:19:12.554]  And it's like it's a blessing to be on there.
[03:19:13.335 --> 03:19:13.915]  And I love it.
[03:19:13.955 --> 03:19:16.297]  I love talking to him and I love everybody in Austin.
[03:19:16.317 --> 03:19:18.539]  I wish I was out there with him because that's my whole crew.
[03:19:18.799 --> 03:19:20.120]  They're all gone from L.A.
[03:19:20.180 --> 03:19:21.641]  So, yeah, it's a blessing.
[03:19:22.882 --> 03:19:23.943]  You called the chaos.
[03:19:23.983 --> 03:19:26.945]  Do you remember what else, what other highlights you called in that interview?
[03:19:28.115 --> 03:19:56.943]   Well you know he's been doing a lot of stuff on Antarctica right now and I think I've been really I got into a lot of spirituality struggle that is going on right now and like my whole thing is like if they can print up all the money all right they have all the power why are they doing any of this and the only answer is it is a spiritual war and they're trying to destroy us For their god, Moloch and Kronos and all these, whoever Satan you want to call it, that's what they're doing right now.
[03:19:57.063 --> 03:19:57.923]  That is their job.
[03:19:58.003 --> 03:19:58.664]  That is the deal.
[03:19:58.704 --> 03:19:59.685]  They made a deal with the devil.
[03:19:59.905 --> 03:20:01.146]  We only got a short time left.
[03:20:01.206 --> 03:20:02.807]  Am I gonna get my impression or not?
[03:20:04.728 --> 03:20:05.129]  Of you?
[03:20:06.069 --> 03:20:06.369]  Yeah.
[03:20:07.791 --> 03:20:11.473]  I'll do that if you have me on your podcast when I come out there March 15th.
[03:20:12.154 --> 03:20:15.937]  I'll do a whole Sam Tripoli rant for you.
[03:20:15.977 --> 03:20:17.077]  No, I gotta have something to save.
[03:20:18.649 --> 03:20:18.909]  For you.
[03:20:19.209 --> 03:20:20.450]  You're always open, man.
[03:20:20.491 --> 03:20:22.212]  You're always open to come on the show.
[03:20:22.392 --> 03:20:22.812]  I love it.
[03:20:23.393 --> 03:20:28.357]  Sometimes when I start talking about this, I get too serious, but I just love coming on your show.
[03:20:28.377 --> 03:20:35.583]  I loved watching you just start become, you know, everyone learn about you and, you know, see your exposure getting bigger and bigger.
[03:20:35.643 --> 03:20:40.767]  And the fact that you're on Alex's, you know, channel is so amazing and I love everybody at InfoWars.
[03:20:40.787 --> 03:20:41.948]  So thanks for having me on, guys.
[03:20:43.008 --> 03:20:43.709]  Unbelievable.
[03:20:43.809 --> 03:20:44.470]  It is Sunday 2005.
[03:20:44.510 --> 03:20:47.133]  We're going to be live for the next seven hours.
[03:20:47.153 --> 03:20:47.413]  Thank you.
[03:20:47.473 --> 03:20:48.494]  I had to throw in Alex Jones.
[03:20:48.574 --> 03:20:51.698]  It is Sam Tripoli with me on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:51.718 --> 03:20:52.759]  Go to samtripoli.com.
[03:20:52.779 --> 03:20:56.743]  Go follow him on all the social media outlets and support the InfoWars store.
[03:20:57.263 --> 03:21:03.063]   All I do is research, research trends, and I see what is having the best effects, what
[03:21:03.063 --> 03:21:04.942]  is having the best reviews.
[03:21:04.942 --> 03:21:11.223]   So a couple years ago, I saw different formulas out there that are known to create compounds
[03:21:11.223 --> 03:21:16.982]   in the blood that flush out the body and that create what they call vasodilation, opening
[03:21:16.982 --> 03:21:21.102]   up the arteries, opening up the veins, which is so important, not just for young people,
[03:21:21.102 --> 03:21:22.863]  but especially older people.
[03:21:22.863 --> 03:21:26.863]   And so then I had Dr. Judy Mikovits, who's such a renowned scientist and a whistleblower.
[03:21:26.873 --> 03:21:28.033]  She said, I love your formula.
[03:21:28.053 --> 03:21:28.934]  It's one of the best out there.
[03:21:29.494 --> 03:21:32.395]  And so this product, Nitric Boost, became a bestseller.
[03:21:32.855 --> 03:21:36.457]  Well, we decided to soup it up and make it even stronger.
[03:21:37.117 --> 03:21:39.298]  So it's the original formula, just a little bit stronger.
[03:21:39.858 --> 03:21:43.760]  Now Nitric Boost is available at InfoWardStore.com.
[03:21:44.160 --> 03:21:49.482]   Because the problem was, the supplier we had, Couldn't supply enough, we were selling out very, very quickly.
[03:21:49.522 --> 03:21:55.664]  But now we've got a big supply of Nitric Boost in stock, ready to ship at mfoolwarestore.com.
[03:21:56.045 --> 03:22:10.470]  And when I talk about vasodilation, and the nitric oxide is a potent vasco-dilator, and it can help relax and widen blood vessels, this can lead to increased blood flow and improve circulation, which is critical to various body functions.
[03:22:10.970 --> 03:22:12.951]  So, ladies and gentlemen, it funds the MFOOL WAR.
[03:22:13.511 --> 03:22:14.751]  It's an amazing product.
[03:22:15.091 --> 03:22:25.274]  So we have the new and improved, super powerful Nitric Boost back in stock, ready to ship for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:22:25.574 --> 03:22:26.575]  This is a true win-win.
[03:22:26.995 --> 03:22:31.976]  This has the very same effect as some of the male enhancement things out there, but totally naturally.
[03:22:32.456 --> 03:22:36.977]  This does it in a natural way, and not that I need those products, but I've tried them.
[03:22:37.037 --> 03:22:37.818]  I've been to the doctor.
[03:22:38.118 --> 03:22:42.279]  They give you a prescription of it, and I've tried the top brands, the two top brands.
[03:22:43.159 --> 03:22:44.980]  And I'm not even trying to say that's what this is.
[03:22:45.320 --> 03:22:46.161]  That's off-label.
[03:22:46.201 --> 03:22:47.382]  That's not what this is even for.
[03:22:47.682 --> 03:22:48.502]  This is a supplement.
[03:22:48.902 --> 03:22:52.464]  But it is incredible what it does for your body.
[03:22:52.785 --> 03:22:57.127]  So get this amazing product now in stock, ready to ship.

[03:23:06.532 --> 03:23:08.353]  Well, nitric oxide is a key.
[03:23:08.433 --> 03:23:10.474]  It's made by our own bodies again.
[03:23:10.895 --> 03:23:15.097]  It's made by L-citrulline and L-arginine, the amino acids.
[03:23:15.417 --> 03:23:16.337]  So we're fed.
[03:23:16.738 --> 03:23:18.699]  You can get it from beet powder and other things.
[03:23:18.819 --> 03:23:24.621]   The nitric oxide relaxes The endothelium, the vasculature, it relaxes the vein.
[03:23:24.921 --> 03:23:26.721]  It's a natural blood pressure.
[03:23:26.741 --> 03:23:28.261]  In fact, I use the two.
[03:23:28.361 --> 03:23:30.862]  Your Info Wars, I keep that on my shelf.
[03:23:31.222 --> 03:23:35.403]  And I feed myself the Cardio Miracle, which is just straight food.
[03:23:35.783 --> 03:23:37.643]  It's a different formulation than that one.
[03:23:37.683 --> 03:23:40.124]  And the two together are a one-two punch.
[03:23:40.144 --> 03:23:44.565]  So you get in your food the ability to make what you need and no more.
[03:23:44.725 --> 03:23:45.765]  You've looked at our formula.
[03:23:45.825 --> 03:23:46.245]  You like it?
[03:23:47.367 --> 03:23:48.188]  I did, and I do.
[03:23:48.508 --> 03:23:48.769]  Yes.
[03:23:49.830 --> 03:23:50.791]  I'm not a scientist like you.
[03:23:50.831 --> 03:23:53.333]  What do these compounds do, creating nitrous oxide?
[03:23:53.373 --> 03:23:54.354]  What does it do?
[03:23:54.434 --> 03:23:59.059]  It relaxes the vasculature, so the clot will go through and not restrict.
[03:23:59.399 --> 03:24:00.981]  It allows it to relax.
[03:24:01.061 --> 03:24:10.328]   It lowers the blood pressure, has the toxic Um, synthetic lipid nanoparticles similar to the one in the COVID shot.
[03:24:10.448 --> 03:24:15.551]  We saw athletes dropping dead on the field, passing out, falling down, all the things.
[03:24:15.692 --> 03:24:17.333]  Why is it particularly the athletes?
[03:24:17.753 --> 03:24:21.355]  They're operating at such a high level in their mitochondria.
[03:24:21.395 --> 03:24:27.479]  This is an energy production, oxygen necessary disease because athletes are running.
[03:24:27.799 --> 03:24:28.639]  They're constricted.
[03:24:28.699 --> 03:24:41.563]  They're working so that the blood flows and it doesn't flow, which is why your nitric oxide product, that new product, I hope you'll show it because that's a very important thing to have for acute events.
[03:24:41.643 --> 03:24:48.065]  It does all under the tongue, give you an instant relaxing of your endothelium, your vasculature.
[03:24:48.145 --> 03:24:53.267]  So get Nitric Boost today at infowarestore.com for 40% off.
