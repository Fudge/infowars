[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.919]  It's Tuesday, June 18th, 2024.
[00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:15.109]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.734]  The globalists are now claiming that Biden's bubbling is fake.
[00:00:20.274 --> 00:00:20.734]  That's right.
[00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:21.535]  You heard me right.
[00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:23.217]  InfoWars.
[00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:25.158]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:25.178 --> 00:00:35.167]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you will, look right here.
[00:00:36.664 --> 00:00:47.193]  Okay, so you did not see Biden wandering around aimlessly, freezing up, shitting himself, sniffing dignitaries, falling asleep, drinking drug cocktails, and frisking serving girls?
[00:00:47.773 --> 00:00:50.255]  What you actually saw were cheap fakes.
[00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:54.418]  It's like a deep fake, but it's just the real video that we don't want people to see.
[00:00:54.438 --> 00:00:56.480]  Oh, and I am a black lesbian.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.201]  And guess what?
[00:00:57.281 --> 00:00:57.721]  It's growing.
[00:00:57.741 --> 00:00:59.062]  The economy's growing.
[00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:00.223]  People's doing better.
[00:01:00.663 --> 00:01:05.067]  We have the highest unemployment, the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.003]  We have more people, we've had over 15 million people, brand new, hiring new workforce.
[00:01:11.684 --> 00:01:23.371]  You know, my son says, you know, we all have various short term descriptions for your jobs, for what you accomplish.
[00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:25.492]  He should say Joe Jobs.
[00:01:27.292 --> 00:01:37.292]  [CROSSTALK]
[00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:49.292]   Biden has no idea what planet he's on, and the White House is now saying these videos are fake.
[00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:59.292]  [MUSIC]
[00:01:59.292 --> 00:02:09.293]  [APPLAUSE]
[00:02:09.293 --> 00:02:19.293]  [MUSIC]
[00:02:19.293 --> 00:02:26.492]  [MUSIC]
[00:02:26.516 --> 00:02:31.017]  Distinguished guests, please welcome the Honorable Lloyd J. Austin.
[00:02:33.158 --> 00:02:36.958]  All the videos you just saw are real, except the first one of the press secretary.
[00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:38.659]  That was a joke.
[00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.400]  And everybody can tell it's a joke.
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.641]  A meme from Men in Black.
[00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:49.681]  But all the others are real.
[00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:51.462]  The White House is saying no, they're all fake.
[00:02:51.482 --> 00:02:53.002]  139 days, 12 hours, 57 minutes, 22 seconds.
[00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.151]  Most important election in world history.
[00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:00.532]  Thanks for joining us on this live Tuesday Worldwide Transmission.
[00:03:02.172 --> 00:03:10.156]  All right, I have really asked a lot for one of the most prolific, intelligent, focused individuals exposing the COVID tyranny to join us.
[00:03:10.196 --> 00:03:15.898]  He's down here on emergency mission to the Statehouse and said it'll either come on today or tomorrow morning before he leaves.
[00:03:15.998 --> 00:03:16.678]  Dr. David Martin.
[00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:18.819]  Look for him probably on the show today.
[00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:19.980]  If not, we'll tape this afternoon.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.680]  It'll be on tomorrow.
[00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:32.811]   We have Harry Fisher is a very well-spoken EMT who's been speaking out about what he's witnessed with the COVID shots as an EMT.
[00:03:34.052 --> 00:03:38.855]  We have all the statistics and numbers here as well to back up what he's anecdotally seen.
[00:03:41.577 --> 00:03:48.042]  But I thought we'd also open the phones up for other nurses and EMTs to call in and talk about what they've seen.
[00:03:49.178 --> 00:03:53.121]  We've done it before, and the lines just get flooded with the witnesses that have seen the terror, seen the hell.
[00:03:53.862 --> 00:03:55.723]  But we know there's now 35 million dead.
[00:03:56.464 --> 00:03:58.906]  Those are the new numbers in the last three-plus years of the shots.
[00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:06.789]  We have prestigious medical journals coming out and confirming it's causing brain damage in young and old, infertility, you name it.
[00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:07.409]  It begins.
[00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:08.770]  Kansas sues Pfizer.
[00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.113]  State alleges company knew of serious adverse events, yet marketed COVID-19 vaccines as safe.
[00:04:14.593 --> 00:04:20.796]  Yeah, they have vaccine damage protection under the 86 Act, but not for criminal negligence or a conspiracy.
[00:04:22.416 --> 00:04:25.518]  So this is going into criminal territory, and this is a big deal.
[00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:29.848]  Doctors shocked COVID vaccines make people retarded.
[00:04:29.908 --> 00:04:30.909]  Major studies show.
[00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:34.613]  We've got more on those studies.
[00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:41.119]  Majority of studies on the topic indicate COVID injections do cause menstrual problems.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.901]  It just goes on and on.
[00:04:43.921 --> 00:04:44.962]  That's all coming up today.
[00:04:45.062 --> 00:04:46.424]  Huge election news.
[00:04:46.984 --> 00:04:48.626]  Biden pushing for total amnesty.
[00:04:48.646 --> 00:04:51.728]  This is just the beginning, just like with the student loans.
[00:04:52.995 --> 00:04:54.436]  It's all coming up today.
[00:04:54.556 --> 00:04:55.838]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:04:56.298 --> 00:05:01.423]  Follow me on X at realalexjones, where you'll find everything we're doing, and at infowars.com.

[00:05:02.163 --> 00:05:03.044]  Stay with us.
[00:05:07.927 --> 00:05:10.489]  Your cardiovascular system is under attack.
[00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.831]  Everybody knows it.
[00:05:12.471 --> 00:05:18.977]  I've got in my hands two products that are absolutely insane when it comes to what they do for your body and your overall health.
[00:05:19.558 --> 00:05:22.561]  One of them is the highest grade fish oil you can find.
[00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:24.563]  Everybody knows how good fish oil is.
[00:05:24.803 --> 00:05:25.824]  This is as good as it gets.
[00:05:26.184 --> 00:05:30.208]  And when you purchase it at InfoWarsTore.com, you support the broadcast, a 360 win.
[00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:32.630]  And then, of course, Nitric Boost.
[00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.232]  You've heard all the rage about this.
[00:05:34.252 --> 00:05:39.816]  A whole bunch of concentrated natural compounds that clean out your blood and clean out your cardiovascular system.
[00:05:40.036 --> 00:05:45.101]  Everybody should be taking both of these products at infowarstore.com.
[00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:49.144]  And both of them, by the way, are 40% off for a limited time.
[00:05:49.404 --> 00:05:54.589]  Now, the sale's gonna end in about two weeks, because we've already sold out of more than half of these products since they came back in.
[00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:01.633]   But if you want to get Ultimate Fish Oil and Nitric Boost for 40% off, get them both today When I grow up, I want to destroy the New World Order.
[00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:03.394]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star!
[00:06:03.414 --> 00:06:10.756]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:06:10.576 --> 00:06:12.576]  I want to destroy the New World Order.
[00:06:12.576 --> 00:06:15.576]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star.
[00:06:15.576 --> 00:06:23.576]   We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:06:23.576 --> 00:06:25.576]  Woo!
[00:06:25.576 --> 00:06:41.576]   We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center the heart of the resistance.
[00:06:42.491 --> 00:06:44.912]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:06:45.433 --> 00:06:58.180]  Well, we have one hell of a transmission lined up for you today, ladies and gentlemen, on this live Tuesday, June 18, 2024 transmission.
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.243]  With 139 days left for the most important election in world history.
[00:07:04.016 --> 00:07:11.818]  People are awake, people are fired up, and as we warned, Biden's gonna try to have amnesty for the illegal aliens openly so they can vote.
[00:07:12.738 --> 00:07:18.259]  Another conspiracy theory comes true, but it was never a theory, it was a fact.
[00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:22.540]  It's the globalist plan of reverse colonization.
[00:07:24.661 --> 00:07:34.041]   But first, due to popular demand, some of the amazing events from TP USA Action with Trump, myself, J.D.
[00:07:33.961 --> 00:07:39.561]   events, Jack Posobiec and more in Detroit as we battle to take back America.
[00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:49.560]  [MUSIC]
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:59.561]  [MUSIC]
[00:07:59.561 --> 00:08:10.781]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:13.500]  1776.
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.819]  1776.
[00:08:15.819 --> 00:08:18.021]  1776.
[00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:20.021]  So this fight for America...
[00:08:20.551 --> 00:08:36.097]   Because if this republic falls, the entire world falls to the UN and the globalists and their hellish plan to literally Including your children away from you.
[00:08:36.617 --> 00:08:47.151]  And whether it's Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates or Yuval Noah Harari, they represent the globalist ruling class of the planet who say the future is not human.
[00:08:47.511 --> 00:08:49.113]  Well, we got news for them.
[00:08:49.413 --> 00:08:51.413]  The future is not globalist!
[00:08:51.413 --> 00:09:00.413]  The future is human.
[00:09:00.808 --> 00:09:06.611]  The lies they spread about Alex, they've tried to take him out more than they've tried to take any of us out.
[00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:08.252]  But let me tell you what it is.
[00:09:08.312 --> 00:09:21.258]  What they'll never say is that Alex Jones has spent 30 years being the loudest voice for freedom, for liberty, and for anti-war that this world has seen.
[00:09:21.518 --> 00:09:25.160]  He stood against them, and that's why they're against him.
[00:09:26.408 --> 00:09:32.934]  Well, they have tried to burn him to the ground, but he won't stop fighting!
[00:09:33.695 --> 00:09:35.356]  Let's launch Team Humanity!
[00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:39.660]  Team Humanity!
[00:09:41.962 --> 00:09:43.304]  Team Humanity!
[00:09:46.647 --> 00:09:50.070]  Are you gonna let them brainwash and take your children?
[00:09:52.037 --> 00:10:02.325]  The answer to their 1984 anti-human dehumanization world is humanity coming together and celebrating freedom that God gave us and saying no!
[00:10:02.485 --> 00:10:05.127]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[00:10:05.227 --> 00:10:11.512]  So I have a message to the globalists.
[00:10:12.252 --> 00:10:18.437]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[00:10:21.946 --> 00:10:24.308]  They declared war on us.
[00:10:25.128 --> 00:10:26.209]  They're attacking us.
[00:10:26.529 --> 00:10:27.590]  They're surveilling us.
[00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:28.951]  They're censoring us.
[00:10:29.271 --> 00:10:32.973]  They're cutting off our energy, our water, our communications, our freedom.
[00:10:33.273 --> 00:10:37.736]  We're simply recognizing it and saying we're not going to roll over and die.
[00:10:38.177 --> 00:10:47.982]   Our God is the God of the universe that created There is a global, worldwide, political realignment against the New World Order.
[00:10:48.002 --> 00:10:59.768]  The New World Order is a couple thousand arrogant people led by King Charles, who sits around and talks about how he wants to depopulate people, and so did his father, Prince Philip.
[00:11:00.208 --> 00:11:05.891]  And I'm telling them right now, we are not rolling over and dying for you inbred globalists.
[00:11:09.323 --> 00:11:12.323]  You will not divide and conquer us any longer.
[00:11:12.323 --> 00:11:16.323]  And as long as we never give up, we are invincible.
[00:11:16.323 --> 00:11:26.323]  [MUSIC]
[00:11:26.323 --> 00:11:36.323]  [MUSIC]
[00:11:36.323 --> 00:11:46.323]  [MUSIC]
[00:11:46.323 --> 00:11:59.323]  Old fashioned artillery, genius.
[00:11:59.323 --> 00:12:09.323]  [MUSIC]
[00:12:09.323 --> 00:12:13.323]  America's not going down without a fight.
[00:12:13.323 --> 00:12:18.323]   While other networks lie to you about what's happening now,
[00:12:18.323 --> 00:12:21.323]  InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.430]   Life Life
[00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.011]  (upbeat music)
[00:13:19.011 --> 00:13:20.671]  (upbeat music)
[00:13:20.439 --> 00:13:22.838]   You still think Jet Fuel brought down the World Trade Center?
[00:13:22.838 --> 00:13:26.238]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:49.739]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide!
[00:13:49.739 --> 00:14:01.739]   And I'm so honored that the founder of Ministries told me on air that he was listening to our broadcast when he wrote
[00:14:01.739 --> 00:14:03.739]  and then performed this song.
[00:14:03.739 --> 00:14:06.739]  [Music]
[00:14:04.862 --> 00:14:08.145]  That's the effect of Infowars down through the last 30 years.
[00:14:09.861 --> 00:14:12.904]  Planting the seeds, knowing when the storm of tyranny came.
[00:14:12.924 --> 00:14:19.110]  It would actually be water and sunlight to generate the great resistance now rising.
[00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:21.510]  Now growing.
[00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:33.510]  Don't listen to anything they say.
[00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:46.510]  (Music)
[00:14:47.122 --> 00:14:48.062]  America has been hijacked.
[00:14:48.122 --> 00:14:49.683]  Not by Al Qaeda.
[00:14:49.783 --> 00:14:51.383]  Not by bin Laden.
[00:14:52.364 --> 00:14:53.404]  But by a group of tyrants.
[00:14:53.424 --> 00:15:07.329]  That should be of great concern to all Americans.
[00:15:07.369 --> 00:15:08.729]  They can take me out today.
[00:15:09.729 --> 00:15:11.090]  It'll only make us stronger.
[00:15:12.166 --> 00:15:15.846]  But we still, in God's plan, have work to do.
[00:15:15.846 --> 00:15:17.326]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:15:17.326 --> 00:15:18.786]  [LAUGHS]
[00:15:18.786 --> 00:15:21.246]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:15:21.246 --> 00:15:25.146]  Woo!
[00:15:25.146 --> 00:15:26.546]  Speaking of lies--
[00:15:26.546 --> 00:15:28.946]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:15:28.946 --> 00:15:32.326]  Woo!
[00:15:32.326 --> 00:15:34.326]  That'll put some more ministry on my playlist.
[00:15:34.326 --> 00:15:36.786]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:15:37.705 --> 00:15:40.705]  (SINGING) Lies.
[00:15:40.705 --> 00:15:42.246]  Lies.
[00:15:42.246 --> 00:15:45.105]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:15:45.105 --> 00:15:50.105]  [Music]
[00:15:48.368 --> 00:15:50.308]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:50.328 --> 00:15:52.289]  Thank you for joining us on this Tuesday Transmission.
[00:15:53.809 --> 00:15:54.269]  Get ready.
[00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:56.530]  There's a lot to cover.
[00:15:59.290 --> 00:15:59.670]  All right.
[00:16:01.371 --> 00:16:02.611]  Yeah, don't listen to their lies.
[00:16:02.651 --> 00:16:04.111]  Listen to the pain they're causing.
[00:16:04.451 --> 00:16:05.251]  Listen to the facts.
[00:16:10.192 --> 00:16:14.713]  They have now entered complete 1984 Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs level.
[00:16:16.554 --> 00:16:19.308]   The White House Clown.
[00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:39.073]  The press secretary has emerged from her rat hole to arrogantly spoon feed us poisonous pap that all of the videos of Biden crapping himself and stumbling around not knowing what planet he's on are deep fakes.
[00:16:39.453 --> 00:16:40.213]  They're artificial.
[00:16:41.554 --> 00:17:01.987]   And as examples of this they use then comedy pieces from InfoWars and B, and the rest of it, to claim that obvious joke videos we're trying to push off as real.
[00:17:03.607 --> 00:17:05.108]  No, we're having fun.
[00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:15.855]  The videos we put out and others put out that are jokes are 100% on their face transparent and a five-year-old would know they're a joke.
[00:17:17.779 --> 00:17:30.031]  But whether you're in the EU or whether you're in Australia or Canada, we just played two weeks ago the Australian Prime Minister's statement, President, that they're going to ban memes.
[00:17:31.332 --> 00:17:32.914]  Well, hey, we don't even need the memes.
[00:17:32.954 --> 00:17:33.995]  You guys are the memes.
[00:17:34.936 --> 00:17:39.840]  I mean, just putting clips of Biden up there raw, unedited, is just a total clown show.
[00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:42.120]  In fact, we haven't done this.
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.402]  We've done it, but time moves on, so we're not up to date.
[00:17:44.902 --> 00:17:46.504]  Hey, Darren McBrain, I know you're listening.
[00:17:46.704 --> 00:17:47.345]  You do a great job.
[00:17:47.825 --> 00:17:50.187]  Don't overdo it like you always do, because I want it today.
[00:17:51.708 --> 00:17:55.412]  I'm going to hold you to five minutes, which I know is going to be hard.
[00:17:56.512 --> 00:17:59.555]  Just show the latest gaffes in the last month.
[00:18:00.056 --> 00:18:01.337]  That's about an hour of stuff.
[00:18:02.217 --> 00:18:03.358]  Just give me the greatest hits.
[00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:07.262]  Five minutes of Joe Biden acting like a complete ass.
[00:18:09.781 --> 00:18:11.442]  All of it, you know, real clips, raw.
[00:18:13.184 --> 00:18:23.252]  But it's just amazing that you can watch him on a live feed on C-SPAN or ABC News, and he is just an absolute freak show.
[00:18:25.434 --> 00:18:33.960]  And then they tell you that, don't believe your eyeballs, Joe Biden got more votes than Trump and Obama.
[00:18:35.582 --> 00:18:37.223]  Obama was popular.
[00:18:37.263 --> 00:18:37.804]  He was horrible.
[00:18:37.824 --> 00:18:38.484]  He won.
[00:18:38.524 --> 00:18:39.405]  He didn't have to steal anything.
[00:18:40.882 --> 00:18:42.363]  Joe Biden stole that election.
[00:18:42.683 --> 00:18:43.323]  Everybody knows it.
[00:18:45.525 --> 00:18:50.748]  It'd be like if I tried to play basketball with Michael Jordan in his prime.
[00:18:50.968 --> 00:18:54.810]  Hey, I'm horrible at basketball, so a high school basketball player would beat me.
[00:18:56.051 --> 00:19:00.493]  But I mean, it's like saying Alex Jones beat Michael Jordan at his peak at the Bulls.
[00:19:01.034 --> 00:19:02.474]  You're just like, that's bull crap.
[00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:04.236]  It's just not true.
[00:19:04.936 --> 00:19:08.238]  Or Alex Jones beat Tiger Woods at his prime at golf.
[00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:10.899]  I'm not terrible at golf.
[00:19:10.939 --> 00:19:12.800]  I played it some when I was young, but then I was not good.
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:13.901]  I didn't play enough of it.
[00:19:15.021 --> 00:19:16.522]  So I'm really good at putting and chipping.
[00:19:16.542 --> 00:19:18.284]  I'm actually excellent, but horrible at driving.
[00:19:18.304 --> 00:19:25.468]  But the issue is, is that these people are crazy.
[00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:33.654]  They're absolutely out of their minds believing that we're going to continue to believe their crap.
[00:19:34.815 --> 00:19:39.539]  When the people that even go along with them don't believe the crap they just feel like they're part of the Democratic Party, they're getting some goodies.
[00:19:39.579 --> 00:19:41.941]  They think they're gonna get free tuition or something.
[00:19:42.621 --> 00:19:44.283]  Or they're illegal aliens that want more welfare.
[00:19:44.303 --> 00:19:55.452]  And it's in the news that Democrats are organizing the illegals, telling them, we'll give you amnesty on a person-by-person basis that Biden just proposed, but you've got to go vote.
[00:19:55.852 --> 00:19:58.414]  And now all over the blue cities, they say, oh yeah, illegals are gonna vote.
[00:19:58.675 --> 00:20:03.599]  They pass laws saying, well, only in local elections, but the local elections are generally in the national elections.
[00:20:05.342 --> 00:20:06.903]  Almost every election, unless it's a special election.
[00:20:10.044 --> 00:20:34.093]  So Biden... Biden walks and acts more decrepit and senile than my dad's dad, who had brain cancer, bone cancer, lung cancer, and went through massive chemotherapy, and weighed like 90 pounds when he died.
[00:20:34.413 --> 00:20:34.993]  He was a big man.
[00:20:36.616 --> 00:20:38.536]  And, you know, I saw him, you know, days before he died.
[00:20:38.556 --> 00:20:39.297]  I saw him the day he died.
[00:20:39.317 --> 00:20:43.258]  I was there when he died, but I remember him walking, finally getting in his bed a few days before and never getting out of it.
[00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:45.158]  And he was walking better than Joe Biden.
[00:20:45.978 --> 00:20:47.119]  My grandfather, Jerry Jones.
[00:20:50.219 --> 00:20:51.880]  Eaten up by cancer, looked better.
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.361]  He looked better when he died in front of me than Joe Biden looks.
[00:20:56.341 --> 00:20:58.541]  Joe Biden looks like a corpse.
[00:21:02.482 --> 00:21:05.303]  He can't even pick up an aluminum chair.
[00:21:06.812 --> 00:21:08.833]  Every time he rides a bicycle, he falls down.
[00:21:09.634 --> 00:21:10.575]  And again, we all know that.
[00:21:10.454 --> 00:21:22.414]  But imagine the nerve to tell you that it's fake.
[00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:32.414]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:21:23.483 --> 00:21:25.144]  He's completely out of his mind.
[00:21:25.845 --> 00:21:28.867]  And make sure, McBreen, I don't want to just show the physical blunders.
[00:21:29.651 --> 00:21:34.715]  I want, I want the... The weird munchkin talk he does.
[00:21:34.895 --> 00:21:36.116]  I want a little bit of that in there, too.
[00:21:36.817 --> 00:21:37.918]  The problem is there's so much.
[00:21:38.398 --> 00:21:41.881]  Somebody ought to create the masterpiece, like, seven hours of it.
[00:21:42.782 --> 00:21:49.127]  Seriously, if you put them all together, that I've seen, it's like seven hours of just bumbling, blurbling, having no idea where he's at.
[00:21:49.547 --> 00:21:55.552]  They get him to sleep for days, then come on a bunch of speed, and he practices his speech 15 times, they say.
[00:21:57.094 --> 00:21:58.435]  He can read off a teleprompter.
[00:21:59.622 --> 00:22:00.263]  And that's about it.
[00:22:00.543 --> 00:22:01.544]  And I don't want to digress on this.
[00:22:01.564 --> 00:22:04.826]  We've got a lot of news to cover today, but this is a big deal that they would try this.
[00:22:05.667 --> 00:22:07.528]  So here are the incredible headlines.
[00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:11.727]   White House now claims deep fakes to blame for recent Biden gaffes.
[00:22:11.727 --> 00:22:20.698]   *laughing* And people asked yesterday, why did I spend 20 minutes on
[00:22:20.698 --> 00:22:28.509]   Chuck Schumer, putting cheese on a raw hamburger patty?
[00:22:28.737 --> 00:22:32.078]  And trying to serve it because they're out of their minds, people.
[00:22:36.599 --> 00:22:38.159]  They're not like normal people.
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.701]  And I've just got clip after clip today of this.
[00:22:43.881 --> 00:22:44.721]  It's amazing.
[00:22:44.741 --> 00:22:47.302]  And I've got the big amnesty plan and all the other news.
[00:22:47.322 --> 00:22:47.862]  We're gonna hit it all.
[00:22:48.082 --> 00:22:55.424]  I'm gonna move quicker in a moment, but I just have to keep hammering this because these are the same people that tell you two men can have a baby.
[00:22:55.464 --> 00:22:59.167]   These are the same people They promised they'd never legalize illegal aliens.
[00:22:59.207 --> 00:23:01.028]  When they're promising illegal aliens, they're going to legalize them.
[00:23:02.528 --> 00:23:10.550]  So here is, uh, the press secretary said, countless videos of Biden lost and confused are deep fakes.
[00:23:13.751 --> 00:23:15.591]  Anybody can watch him at any live event.
[00:23:15.611 --> 00:23:16.512]  He does it in front of everybody.
[00:23:18.192 --> 00:23:21.713]  And I know I keep saying that I just, the level of lying has reached.
[00:23:22.653 --> 00:23:26.674]  It'd be like, if I was a press secretary and I walk on the stage, I go, I'm not wearing a black shirt.
[00:23:28.359 --> 00:23:30.140]  Everybody goes, yeah, you're wearing a black shirt.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.001]  It's a black, black, black shirt, dress shirt, collared.
[00:23:34.581 --> 00:23:35.602]  You got a green watch.
[00:23:36.122 --> 00:23:38.083]  You got a beard, salt and pepper.
[00:23:38.103 --> 00:23:41.244]  I'm like, nope, I've got black eyes.
[00:23:42.404 --> 00:23:43.125]  You know, you got blue eyes.
[00:23:43.605 --> 00:23:43.985]  I can see them.
[00:23:44.025 --> 00:23:44.445]  Nope, they're black.
[00:23:45.525 --> 00:23:46.286]  And I've got green hair.
[00:23:46.966 --> 00:23:47.946]  No, you've got brown hair.
[00:23:49.167 --> 00:23:57.141]   So, I mean, if I got up here on the show and, like, did a show where I'm like, hello, everyone, I'm Alex Jones, and I'm wearing a white shirt right now, you'd be like, this guy's weird.
[00:23:57.161 --> 00:23:58.082]  Well, like, what is this?
[00:23:58.222 --> 00:23:59.382]  Like, why does he keep doing that?
[00:24:00.803 --> 00:24:06.665]  But they just want to train you as behavioral psychologists to accept total cuckoo land to break your will.
[00:24:06.705 --> 00:24:07.405]  But it's not working.
[00:24:07.745 --> 00:24:09.766]  Instead, we're all just laughing at you criminals.
[00:24:10.186 --> 00:24:12.087]  But then they laugh and say, we'll just start World War III.
[00:24:12.127 --> 00:24:12.907]  How about you laugh at that?
[00:24:16.969 --> 00:24:19.530]  So here she is saying that none of this is real.
[00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:19.830]  Here it is.
[00:24:20.598 --> 00:24:27.342]  Tells you everything that we need to know about how desperate Republicans are here.
[00:24:28.462 --> 00:24:42.110]  And instead of talking about the President's performance in office, and what I mean by that is his legislative wins, what he's been able to do for the American people across the country, we're seeing these deepfakes, these manipulated videos.
[00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:45.011]  And it is, again, done in bad faith.
[00:24:46.152 --> 00:24:49.694]  Yeah, yeah, we're desperate.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.922]  Trump only won by six, seven points four years ago, three and a half years ago.
[00:24:56.503 --> 00:24:57.203]  They were able to steal it.
[00:24:57.783 --> 00:25:01.925]  He's 20 points ahead in most states, 10 to 15 in battlegrounds.
[00:25:02.245 --> 00:25:04.526]  They don't have enough dead people, enough illegals to beat that.
[00:25:05.827 --> 00:25:07.108]  They're not going to be able to.
[00:25:08.989 --> 00:25:09.889]  So what are they going to do?
[00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.650]  Maybe a cyber outage the day of the election?
[00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:12.991]  I don't know.
[00:25:13.271 --> 00:25:14.491]  I mean, they're so desperate.
[00:25:14.772 --> 00:25:16.452]  But again, everything they say is an inversion.
[00:25:16.572 --> 00:25:17.213]  We're desperate?
[00:25:17.992 --> 00:25:21.555]  I mean, I guess we're desperate to stop World War III and desperate to get you criminals off our backs.
[00:25:22.256 --> 00:25:22.776]  I guess it is.
[00:25:22.916 --> 00:25:25.578]  You know, a famous samurai said, guys, pull up the samurai quote.
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.602]  The samurai must be desperate and put it on screen.
[00:25:29.722 --> 00:25:31.143]  Just say, samurai quote.
[00:25:31.223 --> 00:25:32.364]  The samurai must be desperate.
[00:25:32.404 --> 00:25:33.044]  I forget the exact.
[00:25:33.945 --> 00:25:34.566]  I mean, you know what?
[00:25:34.726 --> 00:25:35.266]  I guess you're right.
[00:25:35.286 --> 00:25:38.749]  We are desperate to have you stop trying to chop our children's genitals off.
[00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.212]  We are desperate to stop hundreds of thousands of fentanyl deaths a year.
[00:25:42.232 --> 00:25:44.754]  I mean, it's true.
[00:25:46.587 --> 00:25:49.688]  But you're desperately trying to hang on to power and control.
[00:25:50.689 --> 00:25:52.910]  So, let me show her what a real deepfake is.
[00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:54.191]  A joke deepfake.
[00:25:55.031 --> 00:26:01.174]  And these are the type of videos they put community notes on, on X, and outright ban on places like Facebook.
[00:26:04.155 --> 00:26:05.236]  Yeah, that's a good quote.
[00:26:05.396 --> 00:26:06.196]  Give me the full quote.
[00:26:06.836 --> 00:26:13.079]  The quote, to make great art, one must first become insane and desperate, is from the Book of the Samurai.
[00:26:13.119 --> 00:26:14.240]  Yeah, that's not the actual quote.
[00:26:16.151 --> 00:26:19.093]  It's like a samurai who's desperate can kill 15 men.
[00:26:19.754 --> 00:26:20.154]  That's true.
[00:26:20.174 --> 00:26:22.676]  You gotta get into the battle frenzy berserker.
[00:26:23.256 --> 00:26:25.818]  Everybody has a governor and we're in a physical fight for your life.
[00:26:26.178 --> 00:26:30.121]  You gotta just tell your body kill and just completely desperate and just go crazy.
[00:26:31.261 --> 00:26:33.583]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:26:33.603 --> 00:26:35.824]  We'll say desperateness is the way of a samurai.
[00:26:35.844 --> 00:26:36.285]  Look that up.
[00:26:37.626 --> 00:26:45.311]  But here is a deep fake, but it's obvious she's not holding up a brain.
[00:26:46.431 --> 00:26:47.714]  Scanner that wipes your memory.
[00:26:47.754 --> 00:26:51.582]  It's obvious this is a joke, but like all good art or all good comedy.
[00:26:51.642 --> 00:27:08.764]   It's based completely in truth here it is Ladies and gentlemen if you will look right here Okay, so you did not see Biden wandering around aimlessly, freezing up, shitting himself, sniffing dignitaries, falling asleep, drinking drug cocktails, and frisking serving girls?
[00:27:09.364 --> 00:27:11.846]  What you actually saw were cheap fakes.
[00:27:12.246 --> 00:27:16.029]  It's like a deep fake, but it's just the real video that we don't want people to see.
[00:27:16.569 --> 00:27:18.090]  Oh, and I am a black lesbian.
[00:27:20.392 --> 00:27:20.892]  Oh man.
[00:27:22.113 --> 00:27:24.234]  And that is fake, folks, and you know it's fake.
[00:27:25.075 --> 00:27:26.576]  And it's meant to be obviously fake.
[00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:34.003]  She doesn't really have one of those things from Men in Black that erases your memory.
[00:27:34.503 --> 00:27:36.984]  But she doesn't need to erase the memory of the press corps.
[00:27:37.044 --> 00:27:42.748]  Most of them are there and they completely and totally follow orders or they're not gone to.
[00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:45.529]  Though there are a few reporters like the one at Fox.
[00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:48.871]  We've got a clip of that I want to play here in a moment.
[00:27:50.692 --> 00:27:55.490]   where they say, actually the Justice Department at a press conference,
[00:27:55.490 --> 00:28:08.211]   "How can you charge somebody with something seven years old in a political campaign when they're the front runner?"
[00:28:08.211 --> 00:28:11.491]   And the Justice Department says, "I can't answer that question." The spokesperson,
[00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:14.291]  here it is.
[00:28:14.595 --> 00:28:20.099]  The President talks about threats to democracy, and this is the first time I've had a chance to ask a question since former President Trump was convicted.
[00:28:21.059 --> 00:28:30.325]  How is it not a threat to democracy when you have a prosecutor from the same party as the President waiting seven years to prosecute the political opponent in an election year?
[00:28:31.195 --> 00:28:43.926]  I'm sorry, I don't... How is it not a threat to democracy when you have a prosecutor of the same political party as the president waiting seven years, the crime happened in 2017, to prosecute in an election year a former president?
[00:28:44.366 --> 00:28:47.348]  That's a question for the Department of Justice on their timeline and how this moves.
[00:28:47.368 --> 00:28:48.449]  I can't ask for that view here.
[00:28:48.469 --> 00:28:49.010]  Go ahead, Phil.
[00:28:50.451 --> 00:28:51.232]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:51.472 --> 00:28:53.093]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:53.774 --> 00:28:55.275]  Yes, Lord Nashoggi said it.
[00:28:55.295 --> 00:28:56.416]  We'll have the quote when we come back.
[00:28:56.736 --> 00:28:59.218]  The way of the samurai is in desperateness.
[00:28:59.337 --> 00:29:11.176]  Stay with me.
[00:29:11.786 --> 00:29:15.507]  Now, we sell a unit, stainless steel, that is the highest rated out there.
[00:29:15.868 --> 00:29:17.868]  There's a couple of competitors that are just as good.
[00:29:18.248 --> 00:29:19.789]  There's a hundred others that aren't as good.
[00:29:20.369 --> 00:29:26.952]  It is the best system out there to take thousands of chemicals and compounds down to non-detectable levels.
[00:29:27.272 --> 00:29:30.173]  The tap water, the well water, it is a witch's brew.
[00:29:30.553 --> 00:29:37.697]   And right now at InfoWarsTore.com, We have a special on the Alexa Pure Gravity-Fed Water Filtration System for 10% off.

[00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:12.149]   I have to say that I don't see a big solution other than some sort of mandatory vaccination.
[00:30:12.128 --> 00:30:15.309]  I know federal officials don't like to use that term.
[00:30:15.589 --> 00:30:26.251]  Once people feel empowered and protected legally, you're going to have schools, universities, and colleges are going to say, you want to come to this college, buddy?
[00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:27.652]  You're going to get vaccinated.
[00:30:27.852 --> 00:30:29.312]  Lady, you're going to get vaccinated.
[00:30:29.952 --> 00:30:36.113]   Big corporations like Amazon and Facebook And all of those others are going to say, you want to work
[00:30:36.113 --> 00:30:37.392]  for us, you get vaccinated.
[00:30:37.392 --> 00:30:43.552]   And it's been proven that when you make it difficult for people in their lives,
[00:30:43.552 --> 00:30:48.673]   they lose their ideological bullshit and they get vaccinated.
[00:30:48.673 --> 00:30:51.311]  So he's talking about making things more difficult.
[00:30:51.311 --> 00:30:55.072]   You know, if you want to get into college, if you want to do anything right.
[00:30:55.234 --> 00:30:57.515]  You just get vaxxed and you can do whatever you want.
[00:30:58.016 --> 00:31:03.400]  Now let's apply that to the economy and what we've talked about numerous times about central bank digital currency.
[00:31:04.641 --> 00:31:10.346]  If you want social security, well you better have their digital system with the FedNow app or whatever, right?
[00:31:10.366 --> 00:31:15.710]   It's like, how many people are going to say, I don't know about this.
[00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:16.991]  Maybe it's the mark of the beast.
[00:31:17.011 --> 00:31:18.773]  Maybe it is intrusion on my bank account.
[00:31:18.813 --> 00:31:19.433]  Maybe it's this.
[00:31:19.493 --> 00:31:20.294]  But I need my paycheck.
[00:31:20.494 --> 00:31:22.315]  But I need my paycheck.
[00:31:22.355 --> 00:31:25.298]  You make it really, really difficult to say no.
[00:31:25.958 --> 00:31:28.520]  And you're going to have a lot of the population that complies.
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:29.921]  Just like with pandemics.
[00:31:30.361 --> 00:31:31.502]  Just like with the economy.
[00:31:31.883 --> 00:31:33.003]  Just like with the banks.
[00:31:33.584 --> 00:31:36.866]  And so this is the world that we're entering into.
[00:31:37.227 --> 00:31:42.650]   But if you're an investor, Your goal should be to buy low, sell high, maximize your profits.
[00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:43.630]  And that's what we do.
[00:31:44.111 --> 00:31:46.092]  And we'll hold your hand through the economy.
[00:31:46.132 --> 00:31:49.453]  We'll let you know when it's time to buy, sell, reallocate, do whatever needs to be done.
[00:31:49.953 --> 00:31:51.934]  So you don't have to watch those like a hawk.
[00:31:52.034 --> 00:31:53.435]  And so, because we do.
[00:31:53.595 --> 00:31:55.116]  And now you can do that with an IRA.
[00:31:55.136 --> 00:31:56.497]  You can do that with a non-IRA.
[00:31:56.517 --> 00:31:58.858]  You can do that with your cash accounts, brokerage accounts.
[00:31:59.678 --> 00:32:02.760]  You can take delivery of it at home, or you can have it stored.
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:08.784]  So many options, and we can't use a cookie-cutter approach, Alex, because everybody's different.
[00:32:09.324 --> 00:32:10.645]  Everybody has a different need.
[00:32:10.725 --> 00:32:12.106]  Is it growth, or is it income?
[00:32:12.146 --> 00:32:13.346]  Are you close to retirement?
[00:32:13.426 --> 00:32:14.067]  Are you young?
[00:32:14.587 --> 00:32:18.789]  And that's why we spend so much time educating our clients on what makes the most sense.
[00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:32.652]  They get a consultation, they talk to you, and you guys want a long-term relationship, and then boom, you deliver it to them or to a repository where they want to have this stored.
[00:32:33.152 --> 00:32:34.013]  It's so simple.
[00:32:34.053 --> 00:32:35.073]  You're the place to go.
[00:32:35.473 --> 00:32:44.994]  Everybody should give you guys a call or send an email right now at KEPM.com forward slash gold with your name and number, your info, when you want to talk to them, what the best times are.

[00:33:07.624 --> 00:33:13.462]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones
[00:33:13.462 --> 00:33:24.260]   It was another world another time Another time.
[00:33:24.099 --> 00:33:31.099]  Another time in the age of wonder.
[00:33:31.099 --> 00:33:40.099]  Bagatron, prepare to die.
[00:33:40.956 --> 00:33:48.726]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:49.226 --> 00:33:55.586]   Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:55.586 --> 00:34:07.905]  Welcome.
[00:34:07.905 --> 00:34:16.507]  I have summoned you here for a purpose.
[00:34:16.507 --> 00:34:20.007]  (outro music)
[00:34:20.061 --> 00:34:22.162]  Nobody summons Megatron.
[00:34:24.323 --> 00:34:26.304]  Then it pleases me to be the first.
[00:34:27.405 --> 00:34:31.686]  I was, about six months ago, I meant to do a little video on this.
[00:34:34.528 --> 00:34:38.670]  Just felt like I wanted to research Orson Welles a little bit because I just watched Citizen Kane again.
[00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:39.450]  He was so amazing.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.683]  And I wondered, what was the last thing Orson Welles did?
[00:34:46.484 --> 00:34:53.569]  And the last thing he did, and he went home and had a heart attack and died, was the Transformers movie in the early 1980s that I'd never even seen.
[00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:56.151]  And so I went and watched it.
[00:34:56.171 --> 00:34:56.852]  It was pretty good.
[00:34:56.872 --> 00:34:57.872]  I watched it with my young daughter.
[00:34:59.133 --> 00:35:03.797]  And Leonard Nimoy did the voice of Galvatron and Megatron.
[00:35:03.817 --> 00:35:04.837]  I didn't even know that.
[00:35:05.898 --> 00:35:09.481]  And Orson Welles did the voice of Unicron.
[00:35:11.701 --> 00:35:11.883]  Yeah.
[00:35:13.482 --> 00:35:15.843]  I'm going to get around to do this before they shut down M4s.
[00:35:15.883 --> 00:35:17.063]  We may still stay on the air.
[00:35:17.383 --> 00:35:17.743]  Who knows?
[00:35:18.363 --> 00:35:28.467]  But I want to do a piece where I've been destroyed by the New World Order, and I'm floating through space like Megatron, and along comes Unicron and rebuilds me, and that's Elon Musk.
[00:35:29.127 --> 00:35:30.547]  But I haven't gotten around to it yet.
[00:35:30.587 --> 00:35:34.528]  But I didn't do a very good job doing it right there, but I practiced it for like a day.
[00:35:34.949 --> 00:35:42.771]  I can nail Orson Welles, which I'm proud of, and I can nail Leonard Nimoy as well, doing the voice of Galvatron.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.924]  Isn't that funner just to talk about stuff like that here on air?
[00:35:46.944 --> 00:35:49.987]  I think that's a lot more entertaining, isn't it?
[00:35:50.948 --> 00:35:56.434]  Let's just have some fun, see if I can nail the voice of Baron Harkonnen from the New Doom, which I can.
[00:35:57.015 --> 00:35:57.816]  That's the fun stuff.
[00:35:58.056 --> 00:36:00.318]  You know, not bragging is an interesting factoid.
[00:36:00.799 --> 00:36:05.024]  Did you know I was getting paid millions of dollars a year until Obama got into office?
[00:36:06.604 --> 00:36:13.388]  Working for Hollywood doing voiceovers for movies and TV shows and television commercials.
[00:36:14.389 --> 00:36:19.272]  They put me in the Screen Actors Guild, never asked for it, still get checks in the mail sometimes when they do it.
[00:36:19.292 --> 00:36:26.896]  It's just, you know, I could have gone that direction, but this is so much better for humanity and so much more exciting.
[00:36:27.497 --> 00:36:28.577]  And this is what I like doing.
[00:36:29.638 --> 00:36:31.219]  And I don't know why I just went off on that.
[00:36:32.233 --> 00:36:33.654]  Tangent, but that's what I do.
[00:36:34.294 --> 00:36:37.695]  Okay, I want to get serious now and plow through the news out of a bunch of guests joining us.
[00:36:39.196 --> 00:36:41.257]  Because I particularly prepared for this broadcast.
[00:36:41.297 --> 00:36:46.899]  And then when I prepare, prepare for hours and hours and hours last night, this morning, I just get in here and it's like, wow, this is also huge.
[00:36:46.959 --> 00:36:47.679]  What do we get next?
[00:36:48.199 --> 00:36:57.984]   But but since I mentioned that quote about desperateness, Lord Nashogi said, a famous Shogun, The way of the samurai is in desperateness.
[00:36:58.625 --> 00:37:00.826]  Ten men or more cannot kill such a man.
[00:37:01.567 --> 00:37:03.488]  Common sense will not accomplish great things.
[00:37:04.568 --> 00:37:08.551]  Simply become insane and desperate in the way of the samurai.
[00:37:09.251 --> 00:37:12.933]  If one uses discrimination, he will fall behind.
[00:37:13.914 --> 00:37:18.016]  One needs neither loyalty nor devotion, but simply to become desperate in the way.
[00:37:18.596 --> 00:37:21.458]  Loyalty and devotion are of themselves within desperation.
[00:37:23.399 --> 00:37:24.760]  God, that's so deep, isn't it?
[00:37:27.205 --> 00:37:29.886]  Once you desperately fight something, you know you're in the truth.
[00:37:31.147 --> 00:37:34.048]  Once you totally commit, you're where you're supposed to be.
[00:37:35.468 --> 00:37:37.809]  It doesn't come out of shallowness, it comes out of depth.
[00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:39.830]  And then comes the purity.
[00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:46.273]  That's why when Trump famously said, the deepest thing I ever learned to do was to be shallow.
[00:37:47.293 --> 00:37:49.734]  That's what the samurai shogun is saying.
[00:37:54.056 --> 00:37:55.437]  You already know the truth inside.
[00:37:55.477 --> 00:37:56.398]  You've already experienced it.
[00:37:56.418 --> 00:37:57.298]  You already have the knowledge.
[00:37:57.318 --> 00:37:58.539]  You already know what must be done.
[00:37:59.339 --> 00:38:01.261]  And then you don't question once you execute.
[00:38:02.241 --> 00:38:02.822]  Desperateness.
[00:38:03.802 --> 00:38:05.143]  We should be desperate.
[00:38:05.163 --> 00:38:09.306]  I was about to say they invert the truth constantly, but the Press Secretary inadvertently told the truth.
[00:38:09.326 --> 00:38:10.207]  She said, we're desperate.
[00:38:10.507 --> 00:38:12.628]  Yeah, we are desperate to get you off our ass.
[00:38:13.008 --> 00:38:14.850]  We're desperate to have you stop hurting our children.
[00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:16.391]  We're desperate to stop World War III.
[00:38:16.411 --> 00:38:17.451]  You're damn right I'm desperate.
[00:38:18.792 --> 00:38:21.094]  And a desperate man you should be a little concerned about, and you are.
[00:38:22.489 --> 00:38:23.731]  I'm not desperate to sell out.
[00:38:24.011 --> 00:38:25.454]  I'm not desperate to join your team.
[00:38:25.694 --> 00:38:26.936]  I'm desperate to defeat you.
[00:38:28.118 --> 00:38:30.321]  We've got a lot done being desperate, haven't we?
[00:38:30.342 --> 00:38:31.343]  Let me read it one more time.
[00:38:31.704 --> 00:38:32.825]  Lord Nashoggi said...
[00:38:35.916 --> 00:38:38.317]  The way of the samurai is in desperateness.
[00:38:38.517 --> 00:38:40.878]  Ten men or more cannot kill such a man.
[00:38:41.518 --> 00:38:43.279]  Common sense will not accomplish great things.
[00:38:43.799 --> 00:38:47.000]  Simply become insane and desperate in the way of the samurai.
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.061]  If one uses discrimination, he will fall behind.
[00:38:50.541 --> 00:38:54.223]  One needs neither loyalty nor devotion, but simply to become desperate in the way.
[00:38:54.663 --> 00:38:58.004]  Loyalty and devotion are of themselves within the desperation.
[00:39:00.125 --> 00:39:01.205]  Bingo, baby!
[00:39:01.485 --> 00:39:02.225]  Bingo!
[00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:03.126]  We have a winner!
[00:39:07.563 --> 00:39:09.886]  And they sense desperation.
[00:39:11.988 --> 00:39:13.690]  That has another name.
[00:39:15.071 --> 00:39:15.832]  Total commitment.
[00:39:16.513 --> 00:39:24.441]  We think of desperation in the modern vernacular as someone giving up, running through the woods, away from a criminal, chasing him with a butcher knife.
[00:39:28.645 --> 00:39:29.546]  I gotta try the 13.
[00:39:31.715 --> 00:39:37.537]  No desperation is when somebody's trying to kill your family with a butcher knife and you got up and turn on the juice!
[00:39:39.998 --> 00:39:45.259]  And you jump on top of them and you slam their head in the ground and you ram their head in the ground until their head breaks open.
[00:39:45.279 --> 00:39:49.561]  And then you do it a few more times just to make sure you got the job done.
[00:39:51.081 --> 00:39:53.762]  That is the way of the warrior.
[00:39:55.243 --> 00:39:55.983]  Destroy the enemy!
[00:39:59.329 --> 00:40:00.750]  We've already thought about why we're at war.
[00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:02.571]  We already know who we're at war against.
[00:40:03.951 --> 00:40:07.793]  So now turn it loose in the information war, and the financial war, and the spiritual war.
[00:40:09.574 --> 00:40:11.895]  And stop bowing and caring what these people think.
[00:40:11.915 --> 00:40:13.496]  That's why I meant to get to the sheriff's table.
[00:40:13.516 --> 00:40:14.117]  I'm going to say this now.
[00:40:14.137 --> 00:40:16.498]  I'm going to move on to the news.
[00:40:16.518 --> 00:40:17.698]  I meant to get to it in my speech.
[00:40:19.659 --> 00:40:22.641]  But the crowd was cheering so loud that I couldn't even hardly talk during it.
[00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:34.873]  That what do you think it means that the Republican Party's tip of the spear, Turning Point USA, asked Alex Jones to be there?
[00:40:35.493 --> 00:40:36.333]  I mean, they already know.
[00:40:36.413 --> 00:40:37.394]  They said I was coming.
[00:40:37.414 --> 00:40:38.234]  They had twice the number.
[00:40:38.574 --> 00:40:40.255]  They already know I'm super popular.
[00:40:41.015 --> 00:40:46.437]  But to invite me there means they understand being the rebel is powerful.
[00:40:47.523 --> 00:40:49.604]  They understand people want to take the gloves off.
[00:40:50.005 --> 00:40:55.108]  People don't want to cower, and it means they don't care what the New York Times and the Washington Post say.
[00:40:55.128 --> 00:40:58.690]  I remember when Rand Paul, eight, nine years ago, whenever it was, got into the C.U.S.
[00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.970]  Senate.
[00:41:00.431 --> 00:41:04.153]  And we had him on and pushed him and, you know, had a lot of credit for him winning the listeners.
[00:41:05.254 --> 00:41:06.635]  And Politico called me up back then.
[00:41:06.655 --> 00:41:07.876]  I still talk to the news sometimes.
[00:41:08.776 --> 00:41:09.957]  It was ten years ago, time flies.
[00:41:11.818 --> 00:41:14.060]  And they said, how could the Democrats have defeated him?
[00:41:15.117 --> 00:41:17.659]  And I said, it's simple, but you're too arrogant to understand it.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.361]  All you had to do was endorse him and he would have lost.
[00:41:21.442 --> 00:41:22.203]  Because you're so hated.
[00:41:24.885 --> 00:41:28.968]  And they got caught dressing up their own campaign people in KKK outfits and stuff.
[00:41:29.468 --> 00:41:31.290]  I remember looking at them going, those are Democrat operatives.
[00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:32.811]  Need to do a face print.
[00:41:32.871 --> 00:41:33.711]  People use face print.
[00:41:33.731 --> 00:41:33.932]  Google.
[00:41:34.012 --> 00:41:35.132]  It's a good enough face scan.
[00:41:35.413 --> 00:41:38.875]  They found the Democrat Party operatives dressed up in little KKK outfits.
[00:41:39.456 --> 00:41:42.058]  Now they're saying they supported Rand Paul.
[00:41:44.431 --> 00:41:46.932]  But now the globalists are starting to get that.
[00:41:48.532 --> 00:41:53.234]  But more importantly, the Republicans have decided, oh wait, Trump got more popular with a mugshot?
[00:41:53.294 --> 00:41:57.255]  Trump got more popular when he was indicted and then falsely convicted?
[00:41:58.415 --> 00:41:59.176]  Fakely, a new word.
[00:42:00.076 --> 00:42:00.736]  Fakely's a real word.
[00:42:02.297 --> 00:42:04.657]  So, yes, yes, exactly.
[00:42:05.117 --> 00:42:07.418]  Stop cowering to CNN.
[00:42:07.478 --> 00:42:11.179]  Stop letting them tell you who to talk to and what to do and what's important.
[00:42:11.779 --> 00:42:13.380]  No, the people are desperate.
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:15.800]  The people are pissed.
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.121]  They don't want milk toast.
[00:42:17.141 --> 00:42:17.921]  They don't want pap.
[00:42:18.261 --> 00:42:19.282]  They don't want sugar coating.
[00:42:19.302 --> 00:42:20.842]  They don't want sugar tits.
[00:42:22.983 --> 00:42:24.744]  They want the real thing.
[00:42:25.064 --> 00:42:29.706]  And so stop telling people what you think they want to hear and just tell them the truth.
[00:42:31.138 --> 00:42:38.302]  That's why when the Democrats sued me and came after me and did all this in their discovery, they're like, tell us who funds you and tell us who tells you what to say.
[00:42:38.462 --> 00:42:39.463]  Because they all get funding.
[00:42:39.483 --> 00:42:40.624]  They all get told what to say.
[00:42:41.344 --> 00:42:42.985]  And we're like, I decide what to say.
[00:42:43.645 --> 00:42:43.825]  Me.
[00:42:44.626 --> 00:42:45.066]  I'm in charge.
[00:42:46.507 --> 00:42:47.207]  We know that's not true.
[00:42:47.788 --> 00:42:49.109]  And the judge just said, we're defaulting you.
[00:42:49.129 --> 00:42:50.389]  We know you're under somebody's control.
[00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:51.830]  We know you're under somebody's command.
[00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:52.190]  Yep.
[00:42:52.471 --> 00:42:52.931]  It's called God.
[00:42:54.588 --> 00:42:55.289]  And it's my listeners.
[00:42:55.369 --> 00:42:58.752]  I don't do what my listeners tell me, but most of the time I agree with them and they give me better intel.
[00:42:59.232 --> 00:43:00.794]  And so I do go off the listeners.
[00:43:00.834 --> 00:43:04.057]  I take calls all the time and callers make points that I was like, that's incredible.
[00:43:04.097 --> 00:43:04.417]  Wow.
[00:43:04.457 --> 00:43:06.399]  That's like, you know, we all do this together.
[00:43:08.481 --> 00:43:10.403]  So it's a college of understanding.
[00:43:13.386 --> 00:43:14.847]  Turn my phone ringer off here.
[00:43:17.089 --> 00:43:17.270]  So.
[00:43:18.607 --> 00:43:19.588]  Yeah, they got caught again.
[00:43:19.628 --> 00:43:22.771]  Lincoln Project members posed as white supremacists at Virginia's EOP event.
[00:43:22.791 --> 00:43:26.895]  They just arrested a Democrat running for officer in Texas doing fake attacks on himself.
[00:43:26.935 --> 00:43:33.962]  I mean, it's just turned out like 80% of these attacks on Jewish sinners and black people were done by the left.
[00:43:35.223 --> 00:43:37.985]  And sometimes it's not the person doing it themselves, the left goes and does it.
[00:43:38.386 --> 00:43:39.647]  That's how we got Candace Owens.
[00:43:41.429 --> 00:43:42.530]  Candace Owens was a liberal.
[00:43:43.855 --> 00:43:47.977]  Norm Pattis, my lawyer, represented her in Connecticut when she really did get discriminated against in school.
[00:43:48.017 --> 00:43:48.817]  They won a big settlement.
[00:43:48.837 --> 00:43:50.117]  That's all private.
[00:43:51.018 --> 00:43:52.358]  And I was one of the first people to interview her.
[00:43:52.378 --> 00:43:53.119]  Paul was the first.
[00:43:53.179 --> 00:43:53.799]  I was the second.
[00:43:54.619 --> 00:44:03.623]  And what woke her up is she was doing a social media group for women, for women in business and feminists.
[00:44:04.743 --> 00:44:09.825]  And she kept getting these emails, white supremacists threatening her and all this.
[00:44:11.092 --> 00:44:16.293]  So this feminist group behind it, who was doing it, could then come to aid her and suck her in and control her.
[00:44:16.313 --> 00:44:17.534]  They do the same thing at college.
[00:44:17.934 --> 00:44:18.934]  The young people get there.
[00:44:19.354 --> 00:44:19.894]  They're scared.
[00:44:19.915 --> 00:44:21.175]  They go, hey, there's a KKK rally.
[00:44:21.195 --> 00:44:22.135]  They come in here with us.
[00:44:22.575 --> 00:44:25.196]  And they bring them in and brainwash them and, you know, get them into the cult.
[00:44:26.056 --> 00:44:29.777]  And then the professors all act like the students are radical and they don't know what's going on.
[00:44:29.797 --> 00:44:31.638]  And they give them all this power because they're leftist.
[00:44:32.258 --> 00:44:34.119]  It's the foundations funding all this doing it.
[00:44:34.159 --> 00:44:35.679]  It's all a mind manipulation.
[00:44:37.622 --> 00:44:42.785]  So Candace Owens found out that because one of them was dumb enough, they kept sending her these threats.
[00:44:43.126 --> 00:44:45.207]  If I remember right, she told me this story like 10 years ago.
[00:44:46.708 --> 00:44:49.270]  They left one of their emails on it.
[00:44:51.731 --> 00:44:52.532]  In the metadata.
[00:44:53.012 --> 00:44:54.793]  And she was smart enough to scan the metadata.
[00:44:57.115 --> 00:44:59.236]  And she called them up and she said, hey, why are you doing this to me?
[00:45:00.217 --> 00:45:01.438]  She goes, well, they said, well, who told you?
[00:45:01.478 --> 00:45:01.898]  How do you know?
[00:45:01.918 --> 00:45:02.939]  She goes, oh, I got your ass.
[00:45:04.918 --> 00:45:07.119]  So, that's how they do this, folks.
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:08.700]  And that's how they operate.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.462]  Almost all these KKK groups are run by the Feds.
[00:45:11.482 --> 00:45:12.242]  That's come out in the news.
[00:45:12.923 --> 00:45:13.423]  Mainstream news.
[00:45:13.883 --> 00:45:16.125]  Almost all the white supremacist groups run by the Feds.
[00:45:17.946 --> 00:45:20.948]  And they do that to have opposition they can control.
[00:45:20.968 --> 00:45:22.609]  Because the last thing they want is a big tent.
[00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:26.431]  People see through it now, folks.
[00:45:26.451 --> 00:45:30.113]  You've been hearing for months they're going to release a tape of Trump saying the N-word.
[00:45:30.393 --> 00:45:31.534]  They did that eight years ago.
[00:45:34.383 --> 00:45:34.743]  Not true.
[00:45:36.404 --> 00:45:36.984]  Doesn't exist.
[00:45:38.644 --> 00:45:45.006]  So, that's how they operate, is lies and deception.
[00:45:45.246 --> 00:45:51.868]  And I know you know that, but until you've been a public figure under attack by them, I don't think you realize the total level of lies.
[00:45:54.329 --> 00:45:58.912]  So let's shift gears into all the news now, and I'll continue to do this in the next hour, and we got a bunch of guys coming up and stuff.
[00:45:58.992 --> 00:46:03.275]  I'll probably end up hosting the fourth hour with Dr. Martin, or we'll tape after the show and scare him tomorrow.
[00:46:03.975 --> 00:46:10.059]  He's still at the Statehouse right now in a very important meeting, because Texas is getting ready to do what Kansas just did.
[00:46:09.879 --> 00:46:22.119]   And we're not just talking about civil, we're talking about criminal stuff on Pfizer, Moderna,
[00:46:22.119 --> 00:46:27.598]  J&J.
[00:46:27.598 --> 00:46:30.199]  Because we're not laying down.
[00:46:30.824 --> 00:46:34.346]  We're not playing patty cake, patty cake, baker's man.
[00:46:36.427 --> 00:46:38.588]  Roll them up, roll them up, put them in a pan.
[00:46:40.629 --> 00:46:42.110]  Mark them and prick them just for me.
[00:46:44.511 --> 00:46:45.932]  Forget the exact patty caking.
[00:46:45.972 --> 00:46:51.755]  I haven't done that in about 48 years, but I have a vague memory of patty cake, patty cake, baker's man.
[00:46:52.035 --> 00:46:54.757]  Can we pull up the actual patty cake, patty cake nursery rhyme?
[00:46:56.895 --> 00:46:58.595]  I remember my mother doing it with a pinch in my belly.
[00:46:59.315 --> 00:47:01.036]  Patty cake, patty cake, Bakers, man.
[00:47:01.716 --> 00:47:01.976]  All right.
[00:47:03.376 --> 00:47:07.297]  Joe Biden's immigration move sparks GOP rage.
[00:47:08.337 --> 00:47:08.717]  Rage.
[00:47:10.837 --> 00:47:11.517]  Newsweek reports.
[00:47:12.898 --> 00:47:17.058]  Democrat celebrations.
[00:47:17.599 --> 00:47:21.199]  Remember how many times they told you no illegals are ever going to vote?
[00:47:21.259 --> 00:47:22.519]  We don't want them here to vote.
[00:47:22.979 --> 00:47:30.360]   Call them migrants, though, and then all these cities from Chicago, To San Francisco, to you name it, hundreds of them.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.221]  Pass laws, the illegals can vote.
[00:47:32.961 --> 00:47:33.942]  And the feds don't challenge it.
[00:47:34.642 --> 00:47:35.602]  Totally unconstitutional.
[00:47:37.583 --> 00:47:45.085]  And now they're running around with Zuckerberg's list, that cost 400 plus million dollars to dredge up, of dead people and folks moved out of district.
[00:47:45.145 --> 00:47:46.586]  And people have done the studies, we've covered them.
[00:47:48.226 --> 00:47:48.947]  We'll go back to that in a minute.
[00:47:52.301 --> 00:48:07.892]  The GOP's done big studies, some others we covered a few weeks ago, where they go out and contact thousands of random conservative voters and others that have moved out of state years ago, two, five, ten years, and they ask them, did you vote?
[00:48:09.393 --> 00:48:15.457]  And they respond back, oh no, we didn't vote in Michigan, I live in California now, or I didn't vote in California, I live in Texas now.
[00:48:16.317 --> 00:48:33.971]   And so then they get the permission to interview them, and they found in samplings, 15% in multiple states of people that voted when they contact them, did not vote in that state.
[00:48:34.892 --> 00:48:35.052]  Yeah.
[00:48:36.412 --> 00:48:36.592]  Yeah.
[00:48:37.473 --> 00:48:37.953]  Now you see.
[00:48:38.433 --> 00:48:45.918]  And they did other studies on it as well, where they also did studies and asked Democrats in surveys, did you vote in another state?
[00:48:45.998 --> 00:48:47.098]  And a bunch of them said, yeah.
[00:48:47.398 --> 00:48:48.739]  Again, strangely enough, same number, 15%.
[00:48:49.019 --> 00:48:49.419]  Look it up.
[00:48:53.137 --> 00:48:54.478]  I mean, these people don't even either.
[00:48:54.518 --> 00:48:55.879]  Of course I voted against Trump.
[00:48:55.899 --> 00:48:56.539]  I hate him.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.461]  I voted in California and Michigan.
[00:48:59.461 --> 00:49:01.443]  I voted in Florida and in Tennessee.
[00:49:01.483 --> 00:49:02.643]  Screw that son of a bitch.
[00:49:05.145 --> 00:49:07.907]  And these, each one of these little factoids would sink them.
[00:49:08.848 --> 00:49:11.830]  But there's so many hitting us, it's like, whoa!
[00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:13.291]  And that's the tactic.
[00:49:14.892 --> 00:49:15.072]  So.
[00:49:17.265 --> 00:49:28.795]  Joe Biden wants anybody that's basically gotten here who quotes married to an American or has a kid, anchor baby, cannot be deported by Trump.
[00:49:30.917 --> 00:49:34.279]  So they're retroactively trying to get ready for Trump to get in.
[00:49:36.621 --> 00:49:39.164]  President Joe Biden is not the president.
[00:49:39.204 --> 00:49:40.685]  He's the Obama puppet.
[00:49:41.934 --> 00:49:46.377]  Reportedly offer migrants, no it's not, illegal aliens, illegal aliens, married U.S.
[00:49:46.397 --> 00:49:53.822]  citizens, work permits, and protection from deportation has sparked praise from Democrats and condemnation from Republicans.
[00:49:54.442 --> 00:50:03.809]  Biden said today, he said to announce a parole-in-place program, and if he gets away with this it'll be $10 million, but now it's $500,000.
[00:50:04.269 --> 00:50:16.487]   Undocumented spouses of American citizens during a ceremony celebrating former President Barack Obama's Deferred action on childhood arrivals, DACA program, according to the Associated Press.
[00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:20.790]  And then the illegals just start dragging a kid with them that didn't even have a kid to get in and be able to stay.
[00:50:23.852 --> 00:50:32.558]  And of course, they'll just have these big mass weddings like they used to have in South Korea, under Reverend Moon.
[00:50:35.196 --> 00:50:39.259]  They'll just have mass weddings and then it doesn't even mean anything and they can all stay.
[00:50:40.059 --> 00:50:42.261]  And that's just a test salvo.
[00:50:43.802 --> 00:50:47.545]  Senior Trump advisor, Biden amnesty, executive order, an impeachable offense.
[00:50:47.805 --> 00:50:48.225]  Think so?
[00:50:49.606 --> 00:50:50.327]  Outside of law.
[00:50:50.907 --> 00:50:54.009]  Meanwhile, Biden's like, oh no, I don't want the border open.
[00:50:54.089 --> 00:50:54.730]  No, no, no.
[00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:57.632]  I just said when I win, immediately surge the border.
[00:51:01.223 --> 00:51:06.448]  But it's okay, because the White House now claims deepfakes to Biden's recent gaffes.
[00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:12.693]  Biden blurts incoherent outbursts at reporters day after freezing up on stage.
[00:51:13.974 --> 00:51:17.217]  Biden announces mass amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants.
[00:51:19.439 --> 00:51:25.784]  Trump speaks out on murder of Rachel Maureen by illegal alien, fled the U.S.
[00:51:25.824 --> 00:51:28.927]  because he knew Crooked Joe would let him in, where he committed another murder.
[00:51:33.041 --> 00:51:35.262]  It just goes on and on here.
[00:51:39.884 --> 00:51:40.945]  But let's play this clip.
[00:51:42.886 --> 00:51:44.406]  This is Kamala Harris.
[00:51:47.027 --> 00:51:53.731]  Says that under the Biden administration, special taxpayer-funded contracts are being given to non-white entrepreneurs and businesses.
[00:51:54.151 --> 00:51:55.391]  This is anti-white discrimination.
[00:51:55.731 --> 00:52:00.894]  And what about all the ads in Europe and here and all over that say, hey, if you're white, need not apply.
[00:52:02.935 --> 00:52:05.597]  That is meant to make white people hate brown people.
[00:52:06.338 --> 00:52:08.640]  And it's meant to have brown people think they're siding with the government.
[00:52:09.361 --> 00:52:10.041]  It's wrong.
[00:52:10.502 --> 00:52:11.122]  It's evil.
[00:52:11.923 --> 00:52:12.724]  It needs to stop.
[00:52:12.764 --> 00:52:15.246]  But it is the globalists, the ruling class, that are doing it.
[00:52:15.606 --> 00:52:17.368]  And they're only handing out some of these.
[00:52:17.828 --> 00:52:21.051]  Notice, I said Biden's never going to give full tuition forgivance.
[00:52:22.051 --> 00:52:22.531]  For college.
[00:52:23.291 --> 00:52:23.872]  I said, watch.
[00:52:23.972 --> 00:52:27.793]  He'll get in, dangle it like a carrot, and then he'll do little piece meals.
[00:52:28.633 --> 00:52:30.514]  A few thousand here, a few thousand there.
[00:52:30.854 --> 00:52:32.394]  And that's exactly what he's done.
[00:52:32.835 --> 00:52:36.056]  They decide the few that get the free lunch.
[00:52:36.696 --> 00:52:42.258]  So that people then hope like a lottery ticket, oh, I'm gonna get my free one, and then they got you.
[00:52:42.378 --> 00:52:42.958]  See how it works?
[00:52:43.858 --> 00:52:49.463]  It's like putting a tiny worm on a hook to catch a 10-pound fish.
[00:52:50.023 --> 00:52:51.404]  You put a little investment on there.
[00:52:51.444 --> 00:52:54.927]  Yeah, we'll give a few lucky people a little snack, a little goodie.
[00:52:55.788 --> 00:53:04.655]  Just like when you put out a little piece of cheese on a mousetrap to kill the mouse that's getting up on your counter at night and eating your fruit or crapping on your kitchen table.
[00:53:06.316 --> 00:53:09.198]  You're not being nice to the mouse when you give him a piece of cheese, are you?
[00:53:10.359 --> 00:53:11.260]  I'm gonna ask everybody again.
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:17.760]   putting a piece of free government cheese on the table you might want to
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.600]   look at that thing you're walking up to you know the mouse kind of knows his
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:24.000]   neighbors comes over smells it's hungry man that cheese smells really good let
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:30.719]   me let me just let me just what let's let's let's show go to youtuber X or
[00:53:30.719 --> 00:53:34.960]   something and type in mouse mousetrap mouse killed and mousetrap but let's
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:41.079]   let's show people how this works how the black community do after the 1960s great
[00:53:41.079 --> 00:53:45.119]  society which they admitted was to break up the family.
[00:53:43.450 --> 00:53:44.730]  Paid women not to have men in the house.
[00:53:46.231 --> 00:53:50.552]  Blacks had lower illegitimacy in most areas of the country than whites.
[00:53:51.573 --> 00:53:52.353]  Less than 10%.
[00:53:53.053 --> 00:53:53.314]  Now it's 80.
[00:53:54.354 --> 00:53:55.054]  How'd that work out?
[00:53:55.274 --> 00:53:57.375]  How'd that government cheese work out for you?
[00:53:57.395 --> 00:54:06.079]  Anybody that's got kids knows, you give your children everything they want, you're going to have spoiled, rotten losers on your hands.
[00:54:07.227 --> 00:54:10.128]  You do it for generations, you got royalty that want to kill everybody.
[00:54:10.728 --> 00:54:13.589]  And that's what really, they get 20 generations of spoiled brats, it gets even worse.
[00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:20.111]  Well, you do that with poor people, you end up having criminal gangs, because they're going to find a daddy.
[00:54:20.131 --> 00:54:22.732]  They're going to find a role model, and it's going to be a gang leader.
[00:54:24.633 --> 00:54:25.353]  And it's the same thing.
[00:54:25.713 --> 00:54:29.735]  Whites, blacks, whites are now moving right into the category with blacks, just as bad.
[00:54:32.135 --> 00:54:33.636]  Lawless, crazy young people.
[00:54:35.236 --> 00:54:38.439]  Now, how did it work out for those mice getting a little piece of cheese?
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:41.461]  Probably not too well.
[00:54:43.423 --> 00:54:44.264]  Getting their neck broken.
[00:54:48.788 --> 00:54:53.131]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, that is the moral of the story.
[00:54:53.312 --> 00:55:00.358]  Got a big old bear trap with a piece of honeycomb.
[00:55:00.498 --> 00:55:01.819]  A bear cannot resist honeycomb.
[00:55:02.807 --> 00:55:07.829]  They'll put a big ol' drippin' juicy piece of honeycomb down, and that bear from a mile away can smell it.
[00:55:08.709 --> 00:55:14.932]  And that bear walks up and is excited, it's about to get that, he steps right into that thing, those big ol' metal jaws go BAM!
[00:55:15.512 --> 00:55:20.314]  On that leg, and he's gotta chew his arm off, chew his leg off to get out of there.
[00:55:23.755 --> 00:55:27.897]  So even if he chews it off, he doesn't get far, they follow the blood, they come a few hours later with dogs, they kill him.
[00:55:30.365 --> 00:55:43.613]  So, if I'm walking through the woods and I see, or the jungle in World War II, and I see a samurai sword just laying there on a tree stump.
[00:55:45.374 --> 00:55:47.115]  Do I go over and grab that samurai sword?
[00:55:47.156 --> 00:55:48.516]  No, because it's tied to a hand grenade.
[00:55:48.536 --> 00:55:50.197]  When you pick it up, a hand grenade gets pulled.
[00:55:51.338 --> 00:55:51.578]  No.
[00:55:52.179 --> 00:55:55.621]  You saw the videos in Palestine where they would put up a Palestinian flag.
[00:55:57.298 --> 00:56:00.600]  By a Jewish settler community in the Jewish center, we get all pissed and run over to it.
[00:56:01.081 --> 00:56:04.023]  He grabbed the flag up and a claymore goes off and he gets blown up.
[00:56:04.823 --> 00:56:05.444]  It's the same thing.
[00:56:06.605 --> 00:56:07.505]  And I know I'm belaboring this.
[00:56:07.525 --> 00:56:08.106]  We're going to go to break.
[00:56:09.947 --> 00:56:11.668]  I'll get into Kamala Harris and all this coming up.
[00:56:11.708 --> 00:56:12.889]  I've got so much I haven't hit.
[00:56:13.009 --> 00:56:14.350]  I've only covered 5% of it.
[00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:14.991]  I apologize.
[00:56:15.031 --> 00:56:15.912]  I'll hit it all next hour.
[00:56:15.952 --> 00:56:17.773]  The big guest and so much more today.

[00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:49.240]  My dad owns the company.
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:51.161]  Got a warehouse in North Austin and Round Rock.

[00:57:51.862 --> 00:57:52.422]  Thank you so much.
[00:57:52.442 --> 00:57:52.863]  Hour number two.
[00:57:56.954 --> 00:57:59.536]  Your cardiovascular system is under attack.

[00:58:12.048 --> 00:58:13.590]  Everybody knows how good fish oil is.
[00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:14.851]  This is as good as it gets.
[00:58:15.231 --> 00:58:19.255]  And when you purchase it at InfoWarsTore.com, you support the broadcast, a 360 win.

[00:58:56.163 --> 00:59:00.464]  You know, working at InfoWars, you hear a lot of negative things about your place of work.
[00:59:00.864 --> 00:59:04.845]  One of the things they like to say about our supplements is we're snake oil salesmen.
[00:59:04.965 --> 00:59:06.706]  Well, folks, it ain't snake oil.
[00:59:06.826 --> 00:59:09.047]  It's fish oil, and it's incredibly good for you.
[00:59:09.187 --> 00:59:13.448]  Ultimate Fish Oil is now on sale back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:13.788 --> 00:59:16.449]  If you only take one supplement, it's likely that's fish oil.
[00:59:16.489 --> 00:59:18.150]  It's probably the most popular supplement on earth.
[00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:20.051]  At this point, for very good reason.
[00:59:20.091 --> 00:59:24.114]  People realize how good it is for them and this is the best stuff on the market.
[00:59:24.234 --> 00:59:31.879]  Studies suggest that fish oils and fish oil supplements can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and prevent cognitive decline.
[00:59:32.219 --> 00:59:45.368]  So whether you're a first-time fish oil shopper or whether you're somebody who has taken fish oil for a while and is looking for the best quality available, go to InfoWarsStore.com today and get Ultimate Fish Oil at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:59:51.691 --> 01:00:18.982]   health with fish oil and fullstore.com The United States looks just like ancient Rome did in its
[01:00:18.982 --> 01:00:19.671]  final days.
[01:00:19.688 --> 01:00:30.753]  Of course, Rome didn't fall in a day, but when it finally received its death blow in 476 AD, its world power status had declined due to several corrosive reasons.
[01:00:31.113 --> 01:00:41.879]   Germanic tribes had beaten Roman forces into submission as Rome had Not many of us say to our sons and daughters, I'm hoping the day will come when you decide to go and pick fruit for a living.
[01:00:41.699 --> 01:00:48.699]   and slave labor dried up, forcing the complacent, unskilled Romans to fend for themselves.
[01:00:48.699 --> 01:00:49.699]  Sound familiar?
[01:00:49.699 --> 01:00:56.829]   Not many of us say to our sons and daughters, "I'm hoping the day will come when you decide to go and pick fruit for
[01:00:56.829 --> 01:00:57.699]  a living."
[01:00:57.699 --> 01:00:59.699]  Hardly ever hear that.
[01:00:59.699 --> 01:01:05.188]   One of the most often made arguments with regard to immigration is that they only do jobs that Americans don't
[01:01:05.188 --> 01:01:05.699]  want.
[01:01:06.347 --> 01:01:17.341]  But in a recent analysis, we actually looked at all 474 occupations as defined by the Department of Commerce and found that there were only six that were majority immigrant and those jobs only account for about 1% of the U.S.
[01:01:17.361 --> 01:01:17.641]  workforce.
[01:01:19.448 --> 01:01:23.509]  But the final knife in Rome's back was that it lost its identity.
[01:01:23.669 --> 01:01:36.014]  Most importantly, Rome allowed the barbarian hordes to settle within its borders, which eventually led to an uprising, putting an end to the identity of a thousand-year-old world power civilization.
[01:01:36.374 --> 01:01:58.226]   Fast forward to 2021, and the United Nations has already decided for every citizen in the United States that over the next As you know, the Secretary General has been concerned about this for a long time, and I'm very pleased that he's launched this program against xenophobia.
[01:01:58.706 --> 01:02:06.011]  If all of the migrants, recently arrived migrants in New York City, were to form a city, they'd probably be the third or fourth largest city in the United States.
[01:02:06.411 --> 01:02:21.740]  As it reads from the United Nations' own website on replacement migration, United Nations projections indicate that over the next 50 years, the populations of virtually all countries will face population decline and population aging.
[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:33.566]  The report considers replacement migration for eight low-fertility countries, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, United Kingdom, and the United States.
[01:02:33.947 --> 01:02:37.348]   Ask yourself, Do we really need the United Nations help?
[01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:42.651]  During the baby boom following World War II, nearly 80 million babies were born.
[01:02:42.811 --> 01:02:44.893]  And for some reason we can't do that again?
[01:02:44.913 --> 01:02:47.794]  Our child's school nearly doubled its growth.
[01:02:47.894 --> 01:02:48.455]  The result?
[01:02:49.295 --> 01:02:50.336]  Classroom shortage.
[01:02:50.656 --> 01:02:52.577]  There weren't enough classrooms and desks.
[01:02:54.058 --> 01:02:55.879]  They gave my boy half a seat.
[01:02:57.319 --> 01:03:03.283]  To give every student some kind of education, many schools had resorted to teaching kids in shifts.
[01:03:04.061 --> 01:03:04.667]  Oh, too bad.
[01:03:05.979 --> 01:03:09.220]  Students sat at their desks for just two hours and then went home.
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:19.204]  Instead, bumbling, stumbling Joe Biden would have us all replaced in favor of a New World Order autocracy of which he is an acolyte and a puppet.
[01:03:19.504 --> 01:03:28.247]  The affirmative task we have now is to actually create a New World Order.
[01:03:28.707 --> 01:03:33.969]  His deceptive intentions are so transparent, a five-year-old can read between the lines.
[01:03:34.952 --> 01:03:40.934]  I think this generation can be marked by the competition between democracies and autocracies.
[01:03:42.214 --> 01:03:44.274]  Because the world is changing so rapidly.
[01:03:46.975 --> 01:03:53.957]  The autocrats are betting on democracy not being able to generate the kind of unity needed to make decisions to get in that race.
[01:03:54.237 --> 01:03:56.398]  Does anyone know who this person is?
[01:03:58.078 --> 01:03:58.918]  What is her name?
[01:03:59.918 --> 01:04:00.419]  Maxwell.
[01:04:00.479 --> 01:04:01.439]  Who is this person?
[01:04:03.999 --> 01:04:07.663]  Is it the lady who got killed?
[01:04:08.023 --> 01:04:11.146]  This is one of the sisters who got killed on Thursday.
[01:04:12.267 --> 01:04:13.448]  Anyone knows her name?
[01:04:15.130 --> 01:04:17.012]  Anyone knows what is her crime?
[01:04:18.546 --> 01:04:23.070]  Her crime is to be Christian!
[01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:24.351]  It's nothing new.
[01:04:24.671 --> 01:04:27.113]  Christianity is under attack worldwide.
[01:04:27.353 --> 01:04:30.475]  From North Korea to Yemen to China to Somalia.
[01:04:30.755 --> 01:04:36.239]  Alarmingly, the persecution of Christians is exponentially getting more severe than ever.
[01:04:36.259 --> 01:04:40.602]  Alright, this is one of John Bowne's longer reports.
[01:04:40.622 --> 01:04:41.523]  It's about 8 minutes long.
[01:04:43.004 --> 01:04:46.046]  You'll find it at Band dot video also posted it at real Alex Jones.
[01:04:46.126 --> 01:04:48.787]  I suggest you can watch the rest of it and share it.
[01:04:48.827 --> 01:04:53.430]  We're about to join a bunch of stations and hit the rest of the news today and big guests coming up.
[01:04:54.250 --> 01:05:03.195]  Please stay with us and follow me at real Alex Jones on X and be sure to share the links from four wars dot com forward slash show for tomorrow's news today.
[01:05:07.438 --> 01:05:10.940]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:15.243]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[01:05:15.563 --> 01:05:24.089]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:24.429 --> 01:05:40.722]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[01:05:41.043 --> 01:05:52.092]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[01:05:52.572 --> 01:06:00.779]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[01:06:01.059 --> 01:06:06.983]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:10.726 --> 01:06:14.730]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:17.092 --> 01:06:21.092]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:21.092 --> 01:06:35.572]   From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide.
[01:06:35.785 --> 01:06:37.365]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:37.945 --> 01:06:41.506]  All right, we are into our number two.
[01:06:41.526 --> 01:06:44.327]  I got a call this morning from a guest I've been really wanting on.
[01:06:44.347 --> 01:06:47.908]  He's one of the top three or four people exposing the whole COVID tyranny.
[01:06:47.928 --> 01:06:56.050]  He's an expert financial individual getting into the whole new world order and the total proof how they created COVID-19 way before it's in all the documents.
[01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:57.330]  Smoking on stuff.
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.341]  Dr. David Martin's talking to the legislature right now.
[01:07:01.262 --> 01:07:05.724]  And so he's either going to come on live in the fourth hour or we're going to tape after for the show tomorrow.
[01:07:05.744 --> 01:07:08.546]  But Dr. David Martin is a wild card.
[01:07:09.006 --> 01:07:11.488]  We've got Harry Fisher, very well spoken EMT.
[01:07:11.928 --> 01:07:15.050]  The numbers all show what he's saying, but he can tell you what he's witnessed.
[01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:18.232]  I was on the spaces with him a few weeks ago, and he's really been having a big effect.
[01:07:18.252 --> 01:07:25.396]  They've been attacking him, exposing the COVID he's on in the next hour and so much more today.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:27.981]  But let me now.
[01:07:28.941 --> 01:07:29.722]  Tell you what it is.
[01:07:29.742 --> 01:07:30.502]  I haven't gotten to.
[01:07:30.542 --> 01:07:31.503]  I've kind of mentioned some of this.
[01:07:31.523 --> 01:07:32.564]  There's a lot of stacks here.
[01:07:32.584 --> 01:07:39.048]  It's going to be a good boy and really get to this in the next 55 minutes of the hours left.
[01:07:40.949 --> 01:07:42.610]  This whole group of stories here.
[01:07:44.651 --> 01:07:46.332]  Tie together with the divide and conquer.
[01:07:47.693 --> 01:07:48.834]  But I mentioned this last hour.
[01:07:48.854 --> 01:07:50.255]  It's a little prelude.
[01:07:52.099 --> 01:08:01.501]  When you hear Biden say, I'm going to give everybody who went to college, or is going to college, or owes student loans free stuff, that's in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
[01:08:01.621 --> 01:08:04.001]  If you did that, it would destroy the banking system.
[01:08:04.042 --> 01:08:05.642]  They financially cannot do that.
[01:08:05.922 --> 01:08:07.082]  And they're not going to, don't worry.
[01:08:07.802 --> 01:08:15.504]  But they can give a few thousand here, a few thousand there, free tuition, like a lottery ticket, to make people believe that they're going to get a piece of free cheese.
[01:08:15.544 --> 01:08:17.824]  But really again, it's cheese on a mousetrap.
[01:08:18.705 --> 01:08:20.465]  So this is really cold-blooded.
[01:08:21.949 --> 01:08:31.017]  They use George Floyd and George Soros' control of the local governments around the country, CIA's he works for, but he's the front man, to defund the police.
[01:08:31.677 --> 01:08:33.599]  And crime has absolutely exploded.
[01:08:33.659 --> 01:08:36.201]  Anybody who lives in a city knows that.
[01:08:37.062 --> 01:08:39.664]  Break-ins, murders, carjackings, they're, you know, record level.
[01:08:39.945 --> 01:08:42.747]  But the FBI three years ago just stopped collecting local data.
[01:08:43.168 --> 01:08:45.630]  They just don't collect the thousand largest towns and cities.
[01:08:47.284 --> 01:08:53.669]  Now, what's that do to the black communities when the police don't even staff there and don't even really respond to crimes?
[01:08:53.729 --> 01:09:01.775]  Well, then the crime explodes, and if you're black, 90 plus percent of the time, you're victimized by a black criminal.
[01:09:03.517 --> 01:09:06.199]  But they don't really show that in the news, do they?
[01:09:06.339 --> 01:09:06.679]  Oh, no.
[01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:09.181]  It's, oh, we're really helping you black people.
[01:09:10.282 --> 01:09:11.603]  We got rid of the police department for you.
[01:09:13.459 --> 01:09:17.842]  And they cut it back for everybody, but if you look at the numbers, it's the black communities have had their police turned off.
[01:09:20.984 --> 01:09:24.927]  There's Kamala Harris, though, saying, hey, we're giving black people grants.
[01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:30.051]  Well, notice what Trump did.
[01:09:31.632 --> 01:09:35.395]  He just said, we're gonna get rid of the income tax for people under $50,000.
[01:09:36.876 --> 01:09:40.158]  And we're going to get rid of taxes on tips.
[01:09:40.979 --> 01:09:42.800]  I don't care if you're black or white, that's a big deal.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.143]  That's 20-30% of putting your tax bracket right there, of your money back.
[01:09:49.684 --> 01:09:52.466]  And yet, and I'm all for helping black people, because they've definitely been screwed over.
[01:09:52.486 --> 01:09:55.769]  I mean, Trump did stuff like double the funding to black colleges.
[01:09:57.130 --> 01:09:59.032]  Doubled it.
[01:09:59.052 --> 01:10:00.033]  A lot of thanks he got.
[01:10:00.073 --> 01:10:02.335]  Well, black folks appreciate it, but the media didn't cover it.
[01:10:02.955 --> 01:10:07.479]  So I'm all about, hey, GI Bill for black folks.
[01:10:07.899 --> 01:10:08.160]  Great.
[01:10:09.249 --> 01:10:11.631]  I mean, you know, the colleges can step up.
[01:10:11.711 --> 01:10:12.552]  They got plenty of money.
[01:10:12.632 --> 01:10:15.435]  These corporations, all they're talking about reparations.
[01:10:15.455 --> 01:10:25.825]  Well, then you just step up and then you just go ahead and then you just give free tuition through scholarships to black people.
[01:10:26.345 --> 01:10:26.806]  I'm all for it.
[01:10:28.227 --> 01:10:34.493]  But do not then discriminate against white people or poor white people and say they don't get help either.
[01:10:37.435 --> 01:10:38.876]  But it starts with the corporations.
[01:10:38.936 --> 01:10:44.441]  The corporations, or the ESGs, want to cut off the carbon, cut off the energy, create a bunch of racial division.
[01:10:44.481 --> 01:10:47.544]  That's the hand they're giving people, is putting a chip on their shoulder.
[01:10:49.105 --> 01:11:03.417]  The biggest thing I could tell anybody in business, no matter what your business is, is have a good attitude, and give everybody the benefit of the doubt, and have a positive demeanor, and you'll sell so much, you won't know what to do.
[01:11:03.457 --> 01:11:04.979]  And everything, everything in life is sales.
[01:11:06.206 --> 01:11:13.728]  I mean, I worked in a few sales jobs when I was 18, 19, 20, and then went on local TV, got on local radio, and then boom.
[01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:18.250]  And they wouldn't pay me any of the local radio stations, so I said, I want to do sales.
[01:11:18.610 --> 01:11:20.651]  They laughed at me, you know, the old guys there.
[01:11:21.311 --> 01:11:22.331]  They said, yeah, sure, kid.
[01:11:22.351 --> 01:11:24.612]  And then they got a little jealous, which I learned about business.
[01:11:24.632 --> 01:11:26.193]  A lot of people get jealous by success.
[01:11:26.433 --> 01:11:33.295]  They got pissed and actually took, before they fired me, when I had the number one show in Austin, took my sponsors away.
[01:11:34.465 --> 01:11:35.185]  Just said you're fired.
[01:11:35.205 --> 01:11:36.866]  We're taking your 15 sponsors.
[01:11:36.886 --> 01:11:37.326]  You got us.
[01:11:37.766 --> 01:11:38.806]  I was the number one salesman.
[01:11:40.006 --> 01:11:41.267]  And they didn't know what to do.
[01:11:41.387 --> 01:11:44.408]  So this idea of white privilege, let me explain something.
[01:11:44.428 --> 01:11:45.768]  I don't care whether you're white or black.
[01:11:47.769 --> 01:11:48.429]  What color you are.
[01:11:49.089 --> 01:11:51.209]  A lot of folks are going to like you because you're successful.
[01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:53.810]  Other people are not going to like you because you're successful.
[01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:57.331]  That's like in that great movie based on a true story.
[01:11:58.131 --> 01:11:59.852]  American Gangster with Denzel Washington.
[01:12:00.092 --> 01:12:00.692]  That's a true story.
[01:12:01.906 --> 01:12:04.427]  Where he thinks the mob boss he's working with tried to kill him.
[01:12:05.008 --> 01:12:07.709]  And he says, listen to the black boss.
[01:12:07.729 --> 01:12:09.470]  He says, I didn't try to kill you.
[01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:13.352]  Your success took a shot at you because you're so successful.
[01:12:13.672 --> 01:12:15.573]  And I'm telling you, that's how this works, folks.
[01:12:16.473 --> 01:12:21.856]  People that are pissed because they're not successful, try to be successful.
[01:12:21.916 --> 01:12:25.458]  That's important to work hard and be successful, legally and lawfully, but also be ready.
[01:12:26.218 --> 01:12:31.441]  When you think you get the success and you think everything becomes easy, no, you just painted a big ass target on your back.
[01:12:33.103 --> 01:12:33.503]  A big one.
[01:12:36.344 --> 01:12:37.844]  Oh, you guys actually already found the scene?
[01:12:37.864 --> 01:12:38.864]  Well, when you get the audio, play it.
[01:12:39.344 --> 01:12:39.924]  Yeah, here he is.
[01:12:39.944 --> 01:12:40.224]  Play it.
[01:12:41.424 --> 01:12:42.485]  Nobody wants to compete.
[01:12:42.865 --> 01:12:43.845]  Not with a monopoly.
[01:12:43.865 --> 01:12:46.505]  I mean, you let the dairy farmers do that, man.
[01:12:47.305 --> 01:12:48.926]  Have them be out of business tomorrow.
[01:12:49.006 --> 01:12:50.326]  He's trying to make a living.
[01:12:50.986 --> 01:12:51.906]  Yes, you're right.
[01:12:51.946 --> 01:12:53.767]  I mean, everyone's right.
[01:12:53.887 --> 01:12:54.507]  It's America.
[01:12:55.787 --> 01:12:59.148]  We just can't do it at that unreasonable expense of others.
[01:13:00.348 --> 01:13:01.508]  Because then it becomes un-American.
[01:13:02.563 --> 01:13:07.966]  That's why the price we pay for that gallon of milk could never represent the true cost of production, because it's got to be controlled, right?
[01:13:07.986 --> 01:13:08.766]  It's got to be set.
[01:13:09.867 --> 01:13:10.728]  It's got to be fair.
[01:13:11.088 --> 01:13:12.108]  Got to be controlled by who?
[01:13:12.188 --> 01:13:13.729]  I set a price that I think is fair.
[01:13:13.809 --> 01:13:14.650]  I don't think it's fair.
[01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:14.990]  You don't?
[01:13:15.150 --> 01:13:15.950]  I don't think it's fair.
[01:13:15.971 --> 01:13:16.411]  I think it's fair.
[01:13:16.431 --> 01:13:18.412]  I mean, I know your customers are happy, Frank.
[01:13:18.872 --> 01:13:20.453]  Bunch of fucking junkies that they are.
[01:13:20.473 --> 01:13:23.595]  What about your fellow dairy farmers out here, Frank?
[01:13:24.795 --> 01:13:25.556]  Are you thinking of us?
[01:13:26.857 --> 01:13:27.437]  You thinking of them?
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:29.540]  Dairy farmers.
[01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:30.200]  Yeah.
[01:13:30.981 --> 01:13:34.402]  I'm thinking of them, Dominic, about as much as they've ever thought about me.
[01:13:35.742 --> 01:13:37.322]  And I'm just thinking out loud now.
[01:13:38.683 --> 01:13:47.045]  If you took some of your inventory, Frank, and you sold it wholesale, that's it.
[01:13:47.065 --> 01:13:47.545]  We could work.
[01:13:48.366 --> 01:13:49.606]  We could do some distribution.
[01:13:51.667 --> 01:13:52.007]  I don't know.
[01:13:52.027 --> 01:13:53.168]  I'm pretty good, Dominic.
[01:13:53.348 --> 01:13:54.128]  This isn't the club.
[01:13:54.949 --> 01:13:56.089]  Later they try to kill him.
[01:13:56.529 --> 01:13:57.850]  The counter black gang does it.
[01:13:57.970 --> 01:13:59.271]  He thinks Dominic did it.
[01:13:59.891 --> 01:14:01.872]  And he says, no, your success took a shot at you.
[01:14:02.352 --> 01:14:03.773]  So that's the point I'm making here.
[01:14:03.833 --> 01:14:06.054]  So let's get down to brass tacks.
[01:14:06.574 --> 01:14:09.315]  None of this is being done because they want to help brown people.
[01:14:09.595 --> 01:14:10.516]  Let's just get that straight.
[01:14:10.836 --> 01:14:11.556]  The world's 97% brown.
[01:14:13.337 --> 01:14:25.780]  And if they can get you to be racial, and come attack white people, so that the globals can take over what's left of the West, there'll be no free countries to aspire to, and there won't be the American model for the rest of the world to want to follow when the globalists win.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:35.461]  And that's why whether you're white or black or whatever color you are, you've got to get in the face of these leftists who are pushing all this race pimp crap and go, I know what you're doing!
[01:14:38.942 --> 01:14:42.303]  And I can play along this race game all day long and be more successful.
[01:14:42.343 --> 01:14:42.863]  I'm not going to do it.
[01:14:43.632 --> 01:14:45.694]  Because at the end of the day, we gotta have team humanity, folks.
[01:14:46.654 --> 01:14:55.742]  That we have unlimited resources, we have unlimited potential, and the New World Order is literally cutting off the resources to make us all fight with each other because they're worried we're coming after them because we are.
[01:14:57.563 --> 01:14:58.624]  So here's Kamala Harris.
[01:14:59.945 --> 01:15:01.126]  Well, just hear it for yourself.
[01:15:02.868 --> 01:15:12.776]  The day that we came in office as an administration, President Biden and I made a commitment that we would increase federal government contracts by 50% to minority-owned businesses.
[01:15:13.948 --> 01:15:15.269]  And understand what that means.
[01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:24.297]  Once you get a federal contract, it's usually for five years, and you can renew it for 10, 20, 30 years.
[01:15:25.138 --> 01:15:38.297]   So, Steve, unless somebody messes that thing up, It's yours for a very long time, which is going to be a source of incredible wealth-growing opportunity for yourself, for your family, and for your community.
[01:15:39.238 --> 01:15:46.085]  So these are some of the things we've done around access to capital to address the disparities that have for too long existed.
[01:15:48.047 --> 01:16:01.777]  Okay, so she promises all this extra free money and she'll have a few examples, but those will be the black leaders that control the communities and keep people in line who also then hire the lawyers, Democratic Party operatives, and then give part of the money back.
[01:16:02.037 --> 01:16:02.978]  It's like the illegal aliens.
[01:16:03.518 --> 01:16:08.982]  They give them welfare and get them a job, but they've got to get part of their paycheck and part of the welfare back to Democrats.
[01:16:10.463 --> 01:16:11.684]  So it's just like the homeless.
[01:16:11.724 --> 01:16:16.287]  They have social workers go out and farm the homeless and get part of the money they get.
[01:16:17.418 --> 01:16:20.980]  And then they get more homeless because they're farming them like a crop you grow.
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:27.403]  Meanwhile, this got attention a few weeks ago, and it's confirmed they're charging them with felonies in Spokane, Washington.
[01:16:28.203 --> 01:16:33.946]  You've got all these leftists where they painted the streets rainbows, and then they show some kids on scooters burning out.
[01:16:34.306 --> 01:16:37.167]  It's what kids do, and put some black marks on the street.
[01:16:39.068 --> 01:16:42.830]  So you burn an American flag, you're protected, and that's fine.
[01:16:42.850 --> 01:16:46.352]  And we say, well, that's your right, we don't like it, but you're going to take our rights if we take your rights.
[01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:50.992]  I got all these cases where the courts were not going to prosecute burning American flags.
[01:16:51.052 --> 01:16:51.312]  Fine.
[01:16:52.693 --> 01:16:56.715]  But then in leftist cities, they don't prosecute for burning an American flag as a hate crime.
[01:16:57.195 --> 01:17:05.860]  But if you are just in a hurry to get someplace and they got street cameras and you spin out a little bit, they all run and take photos and go, we got another person.
[01:17:07.361 --> 01:17:11.903]  And they charge you with a felony for kids on scooters.
[01:17:13.924 --> 01:17:18.833]   But if you want to spray Monuments in Washington with spray paint, that's fine.
[01:17:18.873 --> 01:17:27.078]  But if you're a kid that just does a wheelie in the street, is what kids do, they go, oh, we finally got a hate crime.
[01:17:27.698 --> 01:17:28.739]  You were mean to this.
[01:17:28.759 --> 01:17:30.320]  We're going to put you in jail for 10 years.
[01:17:32.121 --> 01:17:33.722]  Burn an American flag, no problem.
[01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:38.926]  Deface an LGBTQIAA pedophile 26 plus flag.
[01:17:39.586 --> 01:17:40.867]  Prison time, baby!
[01:17:42.528 --> 01:17:43.129]  Here's another one.
[01:17:43.962 --> 01:17:50.324]  Federal judge blocks Biden's title guidance redefining sex discrimination.
[01:17:54.466 --> 01:18:00.188]  Adobe to start spying on all your images and videos to enforce new content censorship rules.
[01:18:00.308 --> 01:18:00.548]  Yep.
[01:18:01.508 --> 01:18:02.669]  All at Infowars.com.
[01:18:03.209 --> 01:18:03.809]  Hate hoax.
[01:18:04.529 --> 01:18:05.550]  Texas Democrat.
[01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:11.992]  Biden appointee arrested on charges he faked racist social media attacks.
[01:18:14.207 --> 01:18:19.471]  against himself to play a victim like Jussie Smollett and get in the news.
[01:18:21.232 --> 01:18:28.678]  Donald Trump's campaign is attracting increasing numbers of young voters, threatening to end Democrat dominance over the demographic.
[01:18:28.718 --> 01:18:30.720]  We have a CNN clip of their panic we'll play in a little while.
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:32.801]  But I wanted to play this yesterday.
[01:18:34.583 --> 01:18:35.783]  And I didn't get around to it.
[01:18:36.884 --> 01:18:37.985]  So let's go ahead and play this.
[01:18:38.125 --> 01:18:38.806]  Here's the article.
[01:18:40.302 --> 01:18:47.627]  From Infowars.com, CNN, America is a democracy, not a constitutional republic.
[01:18:51.389 --> 01:18:54.391]  And they say it's an attack on the democracy, we're not a republic.
[01:18:54.431 --> 01:18:57.673]  A republic is a limited democracy with a set of rules.
[01:18:58.474 --> 01:19:01.416]  That if 51% want to take the guns, you can't, people have a right.
[01:19:02.116 --> 01:19:05.698]  Or if 51% want to re-establish slavery, you can't make the other 49 slaves.
[01:19:07.079 --> 01:19:09.141]  It's a republic, the model of the world.
[01:19:09.974 --> 01:19:11.835]  A lot of folks call their countries republics, they're not.
[01:19:11.895 --> 01:19:12.875]  We have been a republic.
[01:19:14.135 --> 01:19:24.319]  People talk about democracy all day long as it's a word meaning people's rule, but if you go back to the first democracy in Greece, they had a bucket of black stones and a bucket of white stones.
[01:19:25.039 --> 01:19:27.260]  And a white stone was yes, a black stone was no.
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:38.204]  And they would put the stones in another bucket and count them up, and if 51% said kill somebody, that's how they executed people for their thoughts, like Socrates.
[01:19:40.421 --> 01:19:43.382]  They voted that he was corrupting the youth, saying the elite are jokes.
[01:19:44.142 --> 01:19:44.682]  So they killed him.
[01:19:45.223 --> 01:19:46.303]  They ordered him to kill himself.
[01:19:46.343 --> 01:19:47.663]  He drank Hemlock, if I remember correctly.
[01:19:47.903 --> 01:19:53.145]  But they usually, if you didn't agree to poison yourself, they just throw you off this 500-foot cliff headfirst.
[01:19:55.986 --> 01:20:02.088]  The Middle Easterners like stones to kill people, and I guess here in the West, we hang people, but in Greece, they throw you off a cliff.
[01:20:06.049 --> 01:20:08.850]  So, here's the clip.
[01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:12.201]  Is America a democracy?
[01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:14.281]  America is a democracy.
[01:20:14.481 --> 01:20:16.042]  It was founded as a democracy.
[01:20:16.202 --> 01:20:17.642]  I've heard a lot of conspiracy theories.
[01:20:17.682 --> 01:20:20.083]  I hear a lot of things out on the road.
[01:20:20.543 --> 01:20:30.186]  But to hear Americans, people who would describe themselves as patriots, say that America is not a democracy, that stopped me in my tracks.
[01:20:30.754 --> 01:20:40.044]  You are hearing people say America is not a democracy because there are people around Trump who want them to be saying that, who've been planting that narrative.
[01:20:40.405 --> 01:20:41.706]  Is America a democracy?
[01:20:41.726 --> 01:20:41.786]  Yes.
[01:20:41.927 --> 01:20:43.629]  I don't, I think we're a republic.
[01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:46.312]  Well, not right now, but yeah, we're a republic.
[01:20:46.612 --> 01:20:47.293]  What's the difference?
[01:20:48.714 --> 01:20:55.332]   I feel like democracy I think this is really bad.
[01:20:56.153 --> 01:20:57.215]  It's government control.
[01:20:57.736 --> 01:20:59.920]  I don't see freedom in democracy.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.345]  I see freedom in the republic.
[01:21:03.294 --> 01:21:08.195]  Honestly, the word democracy and the word republic have often been used interchangeably.
[01:21:08.355 --> 01:21:10.816]  There isn't a meaningful difference between them.
[01:21:11.356 --> 01:21:18.677]  So much of the warnings and criticism about Trump is that he is a threat to democracy, that he is anti-democratic.
[01:21:18.897 --> 01:21:19.437]  Absolutely.
[01:21:19.537 --> 01:21:26.859]  If they can convince people that we don't have a democracy, then it's okay that Trump is attacking democracy because it doesn't really matter.
[01:21:30.026 --> 01:21:31.707]  We are a constitutional republic.
[01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:33.927]  Even fake Wikipedia admits that.
[01:21:35.708 --> 01:21:40.089]  Now, the United States of America is a constitutional republic.
[01:21:41.190 --> 01:21:42.530]  It's in the Constitution.
[01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:46.872]  But you just saw CNN say we are not a republic.
[01:21:49.092 --> 01:21:51.273]  We are a pure democracy.
[01:21:51.353 --> 01:21:54.134]  No, we are a little d democracy.
[01:21:55.216 --> 01:21:58.479]  But there are safeguards for the minority as well.
[01:21:59.079 --> 01:22:02.723]  And from the founding of the country, Thomas Jefferson said, we really ought to free these slaves.
[01:22:02.763 --> 01:22:03.483]  This isn't right.
[01:22:04.164 --> 01:22:04.865]  We're a republic.
[01:22:06.126 --> 01:22:07.307]  We're suppressing a minority.
[01:22:08.428 --> 01:22:12.071]  So all the civil rights, all the freedoms come out of the republic.
[01:22:13.432 --> 01:22:15.634]  But the left looks around and says, well, whites aren't the majority.
[01:22:15.995 --> 01:22:18.457]  Let's go back and just say we're a democracy.
[01:22:20.984 --> 01:22:27.148]  They think their viewers are idiots, kind of like the press secretary saying these videos of Biden not knowing what planet he's on, they're fake.
[01:22:29.049 --> 01:22:33.813]  That's how insanely stupid they think you are.
[01:22:35.454 --> 01:22:40.117]  Meanwhile, this came out a few days ago, I haven't even covered it, I covered it before it happened, but now it's happened.
[01:22:43.899 --> 01:22:47.462]  The Selective Service, outside of law, is now trying to register women for it.
[01:22:49.133 --> 01:22:51.515]  And Democrats have introduced legislation to conscript women.
[01:22:53.357 --> 01:22:54.858]  And the same thing's happening in Europe.
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:59.582]  They're now trying to press gang women.
[01:23:01.023 --> 01:23:02.545]  Well, you want to be free as men, right?
[01:23:02.585 --> 01:23:06.468]  Well, now you get to go be forced into a war.
[01:23:08.710 --> 01:23:14.875]  Polish lawmaker calls for border controls with Germany after German police dumped migrants, meaning illegal alien invaders.
[01:23:15.336 --> 01:23:16.597]  Let's change that to invaders.
[01:23:19.054 --> 01:23:20.115]  On the Polish side.
[01:23:21.175 --> 01:23:24.316]  Germany, 57% of migrants arrive without passports.
[01:23:25.637 --> 01:23:32.340]  Poland's left liberal government hits hospital with hefty fines for refusing to perform abortions because they put the deputy head of the EU in as their new president.
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:37.582]  NATO chief says alliance discussing putting nuclear weapons on standby.
[01:23:37.622 --> 01:23:39.123]  That means the next DEFCON.
[01:23:41.084 --> 01:23:42.084]  That's a really great idea.
[01:23:43.345 --> 01:23:46.386]  And then here is a BBC report I want to play a few minutes of.
[01:23:47.264 --> 01:23:50.205]  Where they, for the first time, admit they're conscripting men.
[01:23:50.265 --> 01:23:50.845]  Now, you know this.
[01:23:50.865 --> 01:23:51.606]  You've been watching the show.
[01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:52.346]  You do your own research.
[01:23:53.186 --> 01:23:56.608]  But now they're admitting they're doing it, and the men don't want to go die.
[01:23:56.968 --> 01:23:58.689]  But they're saying, come on, you should go do it.
[01:23:58.729 --> 01:24:05.091]  So I say send the politicians that are... I say send Zelensky to the front lines, but don't hold your breath.
[01:24:05.831 --> 01:24:09.653]  Zelensky regime incapable of negotiating, Moscow says, because they're controlled.
[01:24:10.373 --> 01:24:11.174]  I love this billboard.
[01:24:11.494 --> 01:24:14.535]  Politicians should be drafted to fight in every war they vote for.
[01:24:17.998 --> 01:24:22.019]  Here's a clip from the BBC on national conscription in Ukraine.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:32.863]  Ukraine is facing one of its most perilous chapters since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, with Moscow's offensive getting ever more intense.
[01:24:33.363 --> 01:24:41.006]  The Ukrainian army desperately needs to enlist more troops, but more than two years into the war, it's struggling to find willing volunteers.
[01:24:41.026 --> 01:24:45.147]  Our correspondent, Jean Mackenzie, reports from the city of Odessa.
[01:24:47.105 --> 01:24:50.828]  At Sergei's wedding, it wasn't just the weather that didn't go to plan.
[01:24:51.849 --> 01:24:53.811]  Half of the guests didn't show up.
[01:24:55.232 --> 01:24:59.976]  Going out in public is now too risky for men who don't want to enlist.
[01:25:01.998 --> 01:25:06.621]  But the bride, Tanya, understands why her friends and family don't want to fight.
[01:25:07.142 --> 01:25:09.084]  Her father was killed on the front line.
[01:25:09.944 --> 01:25:12.887]  Are you afraid that you might be caught and sent?
[01:25:13.507 --> 01:25:14.268]  Yes, I'm afraid.
[01:25:14.648 --> 01:25:15.329]  I also afraid.
[01:25:16.198 --> 01:25:18.639]  Of course I'm afraid to and don't want it.
[01:25:19.539 --> 01:25:22.340]  It happened twice in my family.
[01:25:25.141 --> 01:25:29.442]  Public transport has become a no-go for those trying to avoid the draft.
[01:25:32.744 --> 01:25:39.686]  Conscription officers have a fearsome reputation for dragging people off buses and taking them to conscription centres.
[01:25:41.069 --> 01:25:43.610]  These officers are on the hunt for draft dodgers.
[01:25:46.692 --> 01:25:53.555]  It's hard to find willing soldiers these days, so now it's the law for men to register, so they can be called up.
[01:25:55.996 --> 01:25:57.436]  Are you part of the problem?
[01:25:58.137 --> 01:26:00.478]  Because people are hiding from you, they're scared of you.
[01:26:01.519 --> 01:26:04.963]  Look, some people react aggressively towards us.
[01:26:05.684 --> 01:26:07.106]  Others run away from us.
[01:26:07.707 --> 01:26:08.869]  This happens often.
[01:26:09.429 --> 01:26:11.853]  I don't think these people have been well brought up.
[01:26:16.091 --> 01:26:21.193]  These guys are having a pretty difficult time finding people who are eligible to serve.
[01:26:21.413 --> 01:26:24.775]  And they do accept that some people are hiding from them.
[01:26:25.095 --> 01:26:33.018]  But they are urging men to come forward because they say everybody has to play their part in defending this country.
[01:26:35.259 --> 01:26:40.862]  Behind these walls, men are hiding at the very moment the Ukrainian army needs them the most.
[01:26:41.724 --> 01:26:45.007]  Russia, with its superior manpower, is on the offensive.
[01:26:47.069 --> 01:26:47.970]  This is Vova.
[01:26:48.449 --> 01:26:51.970]   He won't leave the house without checking these social media groups,
[01:26:51.970 --> 01:26:53.809]  which tell him where the officers are.
[01:26:53.809 --> 01:27:02.929]   I don't walk outside at all now, unless I'm with my daughter,
[01:27:02.929 --> 01:27:06.288]  because they don't take people with their children.
[01:27:06.479 --> 01:27:12.822]  The Ukrainian army says that it needs people like you to fight if it is to win this war.
[01:27:14.563 --> 01:27:16.003]  I'm not a military person.
[01:27:16.443 --> 01:27:17.644]  I've never held a weapon.
[01:27:18.404 --> 01:27:20.665]  I don't think I'd be useful on the front line.
[01:27:21.025 --> 01:27:24.067]  But I know if I get drafted, this is where I'll be sent.
[01:27:28.028 --> 01:27:30.770]  These men who are hiding, I don't consider them men.
[01:27:31.150 --> 01:27:32.170]  What are they waiting for?
[01:27:33.031 --> 01:27:35.832]  Vlad was badly injured serving on the front line.
[01:27:36.784 --> 01:27:43.066]  If we run out of men, the enemy will come to their homes, they will rape their women and kill their children.
[01:27:46.247 --> 01:27:49.108]  Recruitment posters line the streets of Odessa.
[01:27:49.809 --> 01:27:58.992]  The message, to get... What's going to really happen is, if NATO takes over Ukraine, they're going to put 10 million Islamists and others in there that will rape and kill the women.
[01:27:59.972 --> 01:28:04.194]  Ukraine is mainly Russian, it was founded by Russia, it founded Russia a thousand years ago.
[01:28:05.086 --> 01:28:06.406]  And Zelensky's now a dictator.
[01:28:06.446 --> 01:28:07.647]  He's canceled elections.
[01:28:07.687 --> 01:28:09.387]  He's outlawed his political opposition.
[01:28:09.847 --> 01:28:11.287]  Even those that are pro-Zelensky.
[01:28:11.948 --> 01:28:12.728]  It's disgusting.
[01:28:13.188 --> 01:28:13.828]  And it's tyranny.
[01:28:14.588 --> 01:28:15.188]  And it's wrong.
[01:28:16.448 --> 01:28:17.389]  All right, we're gonna go to break.
[01:28:18.529 --> 01:28:28.951]  And I'm gonna come back and get into all the big Trump developments and a bunch of other key intel on the economy and war and the Middle East and more.
[01:28:29.511 --> 01:28:31.152]  That is coming up next segment.
[01:28:31.172 --> 01:28:32.532]  It's gonna be jam-packed.
[01:28:33.308 --> 01:28:35.830]  Please remember, you are the power of this broadcast.
[01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:44.716]  Your support, your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support at drjonesnaturals.com with incredible products, drjonesnaturals.com and infowarsstore.com.
[01:28:45.076 --> 01:28:46.897]  InfoWars is still open for at least a few months.
[01:28:47.538 --> 01:28:48.798]  We may be able to stay on air.
[01:28:49.579 --> 01:28:58.565]  I'd give it a 50% chance, but God's given us more runway, so it's critical to fund InfoWars now at infowarsstore.com and to support our sponsor, drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:28:58.625 --> 01:29:01.107]  I need you to take action, and I thank you humbly for your support.
[01:29:01.347 --> 01:29:03.088]  I'll take action now, drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:29:06.482 --> 01:29:18.136]  As we continue to wait and hope that more and more people wake up every single day, some that took the bait are now starting to realize that we, the COVID-unvaccinated, weren't all wrong.
[01:29:18.817 --> 01:29:22.161]  This is that message to you, the unvaccinated.
[01:29:25.894 --> 01:29:33.037]  Even if I were pollinated and fully vaccinated, I would admire the unvaccinated for withstanding the greatest pressure I've ever seen.
[01:29:33.777 --> 01:29:39.139]  From partners, parents, children, friends, colleagues, and even doctors.
[01:29:39.239 --> 01:29:43.221]  COVID vaccines are now available for children five years and older.
[01:29:43.321 --> 01:29:44.281]  Just get vaccinated.
[01:29:44.321 --> 01:29:45.221]  Get the vaccine.
[01:29:45.382 --> 01:29:46.702]  Just get the vaccine!
[01:29:46.782 --> 01:29:54.365]  People who are capable of such personality, courage, and critical ability are undoubtedly the best part of humanity.
[01:29:54.445 --> 01:30:02.491]  There are many thousands of physicians who have been silenced from telling the American people the good news about the situation, that we can manage the virus.
[01:30:02.611 --> 01:30:07.855]  They are everywhere, in all ages, levels of education, states, and ideas.
[01:30:08.615 --> 01:30:09.876]  They are of a special kind.
[01:30:09.896 --> 01:30:13.459]  They are the soldiers that every army of light wants to have in its ranks.
[01:30:13.859 --> 01:30:19.203]  They are the parent that every child wants to have, and the children that every parent dreams of having.
[01:30:19.523 --> 01:30:28.452]  A North Carolina teenager needs a new kidney in order to save her life, but her doctors say no COVID vaccine, no transplant.
[01:30:28.572 --> 01:30:30.294]  Vaccinated person having a heart attack?
[01:30:30.334 --> 01:30:31.215]  Yes, come right on in.
[01:30:31.275 --> 01:30:32.016]  We'll take care of you.
[01:30:32.256 --> 01:30:34.979]  Unvaccinated guy who gobbled horse goo?
[01:30:35.119 --> 01:30:36.100]  Rest in peace, Weezy.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:39.162]  They are beings above the average of their societies.
[01:30:39.202 --> 01:30:42.805]  You need to evaluate the risk factor in the COVID vaccine.
[01:30:43.085 --> 01:30:48.749]  They are the essence of the people who have, well, built all cultures and conquered horizons.
[01:30:49.530 --> 01:30:51.051]  They are there, next to you.
[01:30:51.271 --> 01:30:54.073]  They look normal, but they are superheroes.
[01:30:54.654 --> 01:30:55.854]  They did what others could not.
[01:30:56.455 --> 01:31:01.899]  They were the tree that withstood the hurricane of insults, discrimination, and social exclusion.
[01:31:02.079 --> 01:31:07.382]  Now, what really stands out about white anti-vaxxers in particular is that they act like their freedom has been taken!
[01:31:07.402 --> 01:31:08.803]  It has nothing to do with freedom.
[01:31:09.163 --> 01:31:10.364]  Screw your freedom.
[01:31:10.524 --> 01:31:14.527]  You don't have the freedom and the liberty to put other people in jeopardy.
[01:31:14.887 --> 01:31:17.048]  Banned from their family's tables at Christmas?
[01:31:17.549 --> 01:31:19.630]  They never saw anything so cruel.
[01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:23.012]  If someone in your family isn't vaccinated, should you ask them not to show up?
[01:31:23.493 --> 01:31:23.913]  Ah, yes.
[01:31:24.393 --> 01:31:25.054]  I would do that.
[01:31:25.234 --> 01:31:27.275]  If you are not fully vaxxed, stay home.
[01:31:27.555 --> 01:31:33.423]  Everyone from police to teachers to firefighters must comply or they will face penalties.
[01:31:33.883 --> 01:31:37.368]  They lost their jobs, let their careers sink, had no more money.
[01:31:37.889 --> 01:31:43.997]  They suffered immeasurable discrimination, denunciation, betrayal and humiliation, but they kept on going.
[01:31:44.557 --> 01:31:47.499]  Never before in humanity has there been such a casting.
[01:31:47.899 --> 01:31:51.542]  Now, we all know who are the best on the planet Earth.
[01:31:52.403 --> 01:32:02.069]  Men, women, young, old, rich, poor of all races or religions, the unvaccinated, the chosen of the invisible arc, the only ones who managed to resist when everything collapsed.
[01:32:02.890 --> 01:32:03.370]  That's you!
[01:32:04.231 --> 01:32:12.477]  You passed an unimaginable test that many of the toughest marines, commandos, green berets, astronauts, and even geniuses could not withstand.
[01:32:13.057 --> 01:32:15.899]  You are made of the stuff of the greatest who ever lived.
[01:32:16.279 --> 01:32:19.601]  Those heroes born among ordinary men who glow in the dark.
[01:32:20.082 --> 01:32:43.002]   Remember you're the voice and it's time to make it count What did he just say
[01:32:43.647 --> 01:32:49.511]  He said there's a storm coming in.
[01:32:50.252 --> 01:32:50.672]  I know.
[01:32:52.393 --> 01:32:55.896]  We told you what was going to happen and it did.
[01:32:56.296 --> 01:33:03.296]  Now we're telling you what's coming at Real Alex Jones on X.
[01:33:04.296 --> 01:33:07.296]  [Music]
[01:33:07.296 --> 01:33:14.296]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:14.296 --> 01:33:16.876]  (upbeat music)
[01:33:16.876 --> 01:33:19.456]  (upbeat music)
[01:33:19.093 --> 01:33:24.377]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[01:33:24.297 --> 01:33:31.297]   Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.297 --> 01:33:41.297]  My love is in league with the highway.
[01:33:41.323 --> 01:33:41.623]  All right.
[01:33:41.704 --> 01:33:53.455]  I want to get into all the big Trump news, the election news, and then attacking Trump and being completely honest again, where he just says, I hope the economy crashes before I get in, because he'll get blamed with it like Herbert Hoover.
[01:33:54.474 --> 01:33:57.056]  He told Lou Dobbs that that clip's coming up, and he's just being honest.
[01:33:57.096 --> 01:33:57.936]  It's already crashing.
[01:33:57.956 --> 01:34:02.219]  We're already going to the other cliff, but he hopes we hit bottom before he gets in.
[01:34:02.239 --> 01:34:03.240]  That'll be a major spin.
[01:34:03.260 --> 01:34:04.221]  He can fix it like that.
[01:34:04.241 --> 01:34:06.482]  I mean, they're artificially doing this, folks.
[01:34:07.043 --> 01:34:08.244]  He can end that war like that.
[01:34:08.304 --> 01:34:08.604]  He can.
[01:34:08.944 --> 01:34:09.364]  The U.S.
[01:34:09.424 --> 01:34:11.326]  runs most of the world, so I mean, he can.
[01:34:11.906 --> 01:34:12.747]  Oh, you'll never do that.
[01:34:12.787 --> 01:34:15.729]  You'll never do this, but he I'll make us number one in energy in one year.
[01:34:15.809 --> 01:34:16.049]  Get it.
[01:34:17.890 --> 01:34:18.311]  The U.S.
[01:34:18.371 --> 01:34:20.512]  is still powerful, still successful.
[01:34:21.093 --> 01:34:22.914]  We could turn this around, but not for much longer.
[01:34:24.676 --> 01:34:25.777]  Oh, I think about it.
[01:34:25.797 --> 01:34:27.598]  The global is still the selection what they're going to do.
[01:34:27.658 --> 01:34:30.901]  It's just going to be hell on earth and they're going to lose in the end, but it's going to be nasty.
[01:34:31.201 --> 01:34:34.063]  Oh, going to be bad, bad, bad.
[01:34:35.945 --> 01:34:39.267]  But I mentioned this during the first hour, but I want to drill into this more.
[01:34:39.988 --> 01:34:41.069]  It is so wild.
[01:34:42.970 --> 01:34:44.652]  To have the White House press secretary.
[01:34:45.853 --> 01:34:46.453]  Miss arrogant.
[01:34:47.414 --> 01:34:51.137]  Get up there yesterday and say Biden is the smartest guy around.
[01:34:51.217 --> 01:34:52.398]  He's got his act together.
[01:34:52.798 --> 01:34:53.639]  He is amazing.
[01:34:54.557 --> 01:34:57.019]  And all these videos of him bumbling around are fake.
[01:34:59.221 --> 01:35:01.022]  Well, anybody can watch him on live TV.
[01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:05.445]  I mean, every once in a while he's hopped up with the right drugs, he can halfway ride a teleprompter, it's still bumbling.
[01:35:05.825 --> 01:35:08.828]  But most of the time it is a derailment of a train.
[01:35:09.969 --> 01:35:14.092]  So here she is denying this is happening, saying this is fake, and then here's the real videos.
[01:35:14.132 --> 01:35:18.135]  That's how dumb, that is so disrespectful.
[01:35:19.042 --> 01:35:21.405]  And that's my frustration, is what we have all put up with.
[01:35:21.865 --> 01:35:24.989]  This is like him telling us three years ago, there's no inflation.
[01:35:25.349 --> 01:35:26.310]  Then, oh, it's low.
[01:35:26.691 --> 01:35:27.371]  Oh, it's good.
[01:35:27.712 --> 01:35:28.413]  Okay, it's bad.
[01:35:28.473 --> 01:35:29.033]  It's Trump's fault.
[01:35:29.834 --> 01:35:30.996]  And back to, there's no inflation.
[01:35:31.616 --> 01:35:35.060]  I mean, that is pissing in your face, telling you it's raining.
[01:35:35.841 --> 01:35:36.942]  And we gotta stop putting up with it.
[01:35:36.962 --> 01:35:37.843]  They're trying to break our will.
[01:35:37.903 --> 01:35:38.184]  Here it is.
[01:35:39.387 --> 01:35:46.232]  It tells you everything that we need to know about how desperate Republicans are here.
[01:35:47.353 --> 01:36:01.003]  And instead of talking about the President's performance in office, and what I mean by that is his legislative wins, what he's been able to do for the American people across the country, we're seeing these deep fakes, these manipulated videos.
[01:36:01.463 --> 01:36:03.783]  And it is again done in bad faith.
[01:36:03.783 --> 01:36:14.024]   I um Anyway
[01:36:14.230 --> 01:36:19.932]  And I don't want to... I don't want to... Well, maybe I'll choose my words.
[01:36:20.652 --> 01:36:24.753]  I was just thinking... Anyway.
[01:36:25.834 --> 01:36:34.536]  I just... Look, I mean... Putin's kleptocracy... Yeah.
[01:36:37.941 --> 01:36:43.307]  It was in February, February, um, January, after we'd been elected.
[01:36:44.368 --> 01:36:45.870]  The late January, early February.
[01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:56.321]  Brought Israelis and Palestinians together at a political level, and they, uh, and, uh, yeah, yeah, the, uh, the, uh, and Al-Qaeda and Al-Sharaf.
[01:36:56.801 --> 01:36:57.361]  And guess what?
[01:36:57.441 --> 01:36:58.041]  It's growing.
[01:36:58.061 --> 01:36:59.122]  The economy's growing.
[01:36:59.402 --> 01:37:00.382]  People are doing better.
[01:37:00.802 --> 01:37:05.283]  We have the highest unemployment rate, the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years.
[01:37:05.743 --> 01:37:06.563]  We have more people.
[01:37:06.583 --> 01:37:08.663]  We've had over 15 million people.
[01:37:08.683 --> 01:37:11.224]  We're in the higher end of the workforce.
[01:37:11.884 --> 01:37:23.587]  You know, my son says, you know, we all have various short-term descriptions for your jobs, for what you accomplish.
[01:37:23.447 --> 01:37:36.447]  He should say Joe Johns.
[01:37:36.464 --> 01:37:39.626]  Are you worried about your work?
[01:37:40.427 --> 01:37:46.312]  Are you worried about- I'll need an effective strategy to mobilize true international suffragette pressure!
[01:37:47.874 --> 01:37:54.019]  I must be right!
[01:37:54.039 --> 01:37:55.280]  I must be right!
[01:37:56.966 --> 01:37:58.487]  My son says what?
[01:37:58.948 --> 01:38:06.353]  That the percentage of women who register to vote and cast a ballot is consistently higher than the percentage of the men who do so, end of quote.
[01:38:06.913 --> 01:38:07.594]  Repeat the line.
[01:38:08.194 --> 01:38:09.675]  Four more years.
[01:38:14.459 --> 01:38:15.560]  Four more years.
[01:38:18.802 --> 01:38:19.783]  Four more years.
[01:38:20.183 --> 01:38:20.683]  Four more years.
[01:38:20.703 --> 01:38:21.083]  Are you ready?
[01:38:21.524 --> 01:38:22.464]  Four more years.
[01:38:23.545 --> 01:38:25.545]  Just follow my orders here.
[01:38:25.545 --> 01:38:39.784]  Thank you all for listening.
[01:38:39.784 --> 01:38:43.784]   Oh Oh
[01:38:44.052 --> 01:38:44.312]  Oh.
[01:38:45.073 --> 01:38:46.954]  Thanks.
[01:38:51.396 --> 01:38:51.896]  Okay.
[01:38:55.498 --> 01:38:56.498]  Joe.
[01:38:56.498 --> 01:39:08.097]  We're gonna post this on X.
[01:39:09.071 --> 01:39:11.073]  When he tells you he's going to do something, he's going to do it.
[01:39:10.893 --> 01:39:13.693]   because they can blame him for all the criminal acts they're engaged in.
[01:39:13.693 --> 01:39:16.692]  This is so dangerous, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:16.692 --> 01:39:25.193]  So, say what you want about Trump.
[01:39:25.193 --> 01:39:28.292]   When he tells you he's going to do something, he's going to do it.
[01:39:28.292 --> 01:39:31.393]  And I agree with about 95% of what Trump does.
[01:39:31.393 --> 01:39:34.393]  But it's so refreshing with Trump that he's the real McCoy.
[01:39:34.481 --> 01:39:37.423]  I mean, you're talking to somebody that is going to shoot you straight.
[01:39:37.463 --> 01:39:40.485]  You may not agree with what he's doing, but you know he means it.
[01:39:41.105 --> 01:39:42.966]  That is so good compared to these people.
[01:39:43.747 --> 01:39:44.728]  That is so satisfying.
[01:39:44.748 --> 01:39:48.050]  It's like trying to eat a piece of air instead of a big juicy cheeseburger.
[01:39:48.150 --> 01:39:49.551]  A piece of air.
[01:39:49.631 --> 01:39:50.211]  It's not even there.
[01:39:50.251 --> 01:39:54.594]  But Trump, it's a big old triple patty, cheese, onions, dripping ketchup.
[01:39:54.814 --> 01:39:55.234]  Boom!
[01:39:55.294 --> 01:39:55.915]  You know it's real.
[01:39:58.092 --> 01:40:04.135]  So he's being very honest that the economy, since he was out of office, since it was stolen three and a half years ago, has gone straight down.
[01:40:04.155 --> 01:40:05.616]  And it's already crashed.
[01:40:05.656 --> 01:40:07.697]  They're not telling the public it's crashed, but everybody can feel it.
[01:40:08.037 --> 01:40:08.577]  You can see it.
[01:40:08.597 --> 01:40:15.800]  I mean, I've got family that are professionals, family that, you know, veterans, you name it.
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:17.081]  They've all got two or three jobs.
[01:40:18.222 --> 01:40:18.702]  Retirees.
[01:40:19.902 --> 01:40:26.325]  I've got all this family, 60, 65, you know, multiple retirees out of the military, you name it.
[01:40:26.365 --> 01:40:27.126]  They got two jobs.
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:34.425]  Because they want to go on nice trips, and they want to have a swimming pool, and they want to have money, so they bust their ass and work 60-70 hours a week.
[01:40:36.347 --> 01:40:45.695]  And the inflation gets worse and worse and worse, and no matter what they do, it just gets more out of control.
[01:40:47.416 --> 01:40:48.918]  So Trump has said this many times.
[01:40:48.978 --> 01:40:58.779]   Every time he does, the corporate media, the enemy of the people, comes out and says, Trump wants the economy to crash.
[01:40:59.099 --> 01:40:59.579]  No, he doesn't.
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:06.524]  He's very clear in the quote, very clear in the interview that he's saying, it's already crashing.
[01:41:07.205 --> 01:41:10.667]  I hope it just crashes now so I can get in and fix it.
[01:41:11.388 --> 01:41:20.154]  So I don't get the blame like Herbert Hoover, who the depression starts right when he's elected.
[01:41:20.634 --> 01:41:22.335]  And he's president-elect and it plunges.
[01:41:22.516 --> 01:41:24.257]  It wasn't his fault, but he got blamed for it.
[01:41:26.365 --> 01:41:28.206]  So that's an honest statement from Trump.
[01:41:28.347 --> 01:41:29.527]  Don't you want honesty?
[01:41:33.290 --> 01:41:37.374]  So Yahoo, it's the top story on Drudge everywhere, at least it was a few hours ago.
[01:41:38.915 --> 01:41:40.896]  Trump says he hopes the economy crashes.
[01:41:42.197 --> 01:41:44.419]  Now you read that, and you're like, what a jerk, man.
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:47.001]  Oh, he's in the hospitality business.
[01:41:47.722 --> 01:41:51.364]  Hotels, golf courses, casinos.
[01:41:52.475 --> 01:41:59.940]  Do you think somebody that's in the business of prosperity... Somebody that owns hotels and golf courses, you think he wants a depression?
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:00.901]  I'm gonna ask a question.
[01:42:01.341 --> 01:42:06.845]  Does somebody that's into prosperity, somebody that makes money on prosperity, are they into prosperity?
[01:42:06.865 --> 01:42:11.448]  No, if you're a big central banker that wants to buy everything up and control people, you love depression.
[01:42:13.089 --> 01:42:14.209]  But Trump isn't a banker.
[01:42:15.810 --> 01:42:23.370]   He owns hotels and condos and Golf courses that serve as casinos.
[01:42:24.714 --> 01:42:27.421]  He wants prosperity.
[01:42:27.982 --> 01:42:29.647]  He went to Kim Jong-un.
[01:42:30.509 --> 01:42:31.549]  And Kim Jong-un cried.
[01:42:31.889 --> 01:42:33.590]  They said at the meeting and cried on TV.
[01:42:34.150 --> 01:42:35.450]  And he said, I know China runs you.
[01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:36.970]  We're ready to come here right now.
[01:42:37.730 --> 01:42:40.871]  South Korea is the most successful country per capita in the world, money-wise.
[01:42:41.531 --> 01:42:43.011]  You're just as good as they are.
[01:42:43.591 --> 01:42:47.592]  We will do you a deal with hundreds of billions of investment first year.
[01:42:47.892 --> 01:42:49.833]  We'll build hotels all the way down your coastline.
[01:42:49.853 --> 01:42:50.673]  You've got a beautiful coast.
[01:42:50.993 --> 01:42:52.693]  We'll build golf courses and casinos.
[01:42:53.033 --> 01:42:54.793]  All the Japanese and Chinese will fly in there.
[01:42:55.494 --> 01:42:57.934]  And he said, you'll make a trillion dollars and you can free your people.
[01:43:00.168 --> 01:43:01.849]  And Kim Jong-un, who's a puppet, started crying.
[01:43:03.651 --> 01:43:04.571]  He didn't know what to say.
[01:43:05.973 --> 01:43:08.755]  And he goes around defending Trump now, saying, elect Trump, it'll be World War III.
[01:43:10.996 --> 01:43:13.959]  China has its foot on Korea since the Korean War.
[01:43:14.019 --> 01:43:15.420]  They don't want them to be successful.
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:17.021]  They use them.
[01:43:17.982 --> 01:43:20.564]  And Kim Jong-un's dad and grandfather did horrible things.
[01:43:21.064 --> 01:43:21.885]  He's a little demon.
[01:43:22.886 --> 01:43:26.949]  But I'll give him this, when it came down to making a deal, he wanted the deal.
[01:43:27.509 --> 01:43:28.330]  But Trump got thrown out.
[01:43:31.533 --> 01:43:34.034]  Trump's like, do you want a carpet of gold or a carpet of bombs?
[01:43:37.015 --> 01:43:38.996]  Trump doesn't like watching buildings blown up.
[01:43:39.496 --> 01:43:42.237]  It doesn't make him feel powerful because he's not a piece of crap.
[01:43:43.078 --> 01:43:50.821]  He wants prosperity, security, success.
[01:43:50.941 --> 01:43:52.002]  Who doesn't want that?
[01:43:53.462 --> 01:43:55.803]  You got a family, a lot of you.
[01:43:56.023 --> 01:43:59.945]  You want to make a bunch of money but create a system where you gotta live in a bunker like Zuckerberg?
[01:44:02.386 --> 01:44:03.067]  Or Klaus Schwab?
[01:44:03.107 --> 01:44:04.468]  No, let's stop all this.
[01:44:05.708 --> 01:44:06.989]  Let's build a pro-human future.
[01:44:07.029 --> 01:44:07.970]  Let's be successful.
[01:44:08.651 --> 01:44:10.132]  Let's deal with the problems.
[01:44:10.212 --> 01:44:14.875]  Let's persecute the criminals instead of the people.
[01:44:18.378 --> 01:44:21.180]  So here's Trump being completely honest and the media spinning him.
[01:44:23.809 --> 01:44:27.932]  When there's a crash, I hope it's going to be during this next 12 months.
[01:44:28.673 --> 01:44:30.314]  Because I don't want to be Herbert Hoover.
[01:44:30.554 --> 01:44:33.016]  The one president, I just don't want to be Herbert Hoover.
[01:44:36.158 --> 01:44:41.222]  So, the media has a very short clip, but he still explains it, but they misrepresent it.
[01:44:41.422 --> 01:44:42.183]  Get me the full clip.
[01:44:42.423 --> 01:44:43.103]  I love Lou Dobbs.
[01:44:43.344 --> 01:44:45.265]  Get me, if you have the full clip, I want it.
[01:44:45.645 --> 01:44:47.727]  Because I saw like a two minute clip this morning, I thought that's what I gave you.
[01:44:48.147 --> 01:44:49.168]  But, my fault probably.
[01:44:50.442 --> 01:44:51.302]  I want the full clip.
[01:44:51.783 --> 01:44:52.623]  He explains it all.
[01:44:53.483 --> 01:44:54.104]  He's being honest.
[01:44:54.144 --> 01:44:56.324]  He says, it's crashing right now.
[01:44:57.025 --> 01:44:59.426]  If it crashes soon, I'll get elected and fix it.
[01:44:59.806 --> 01:45:02.627]  But if they do it when I get in, I'm going to have real problems.
[01:45:03.447 --> 01:45:05.828]  He's talking to you like you're an adult.
[01:45:10.290 --> 01:45:12.891]  He's talking to you like you're not stupid.
[01:45:15.114 --> 01:45:24.259]  Because he wants to drive from his house down a nice highway with happy people to a big happy golf course where they're serving steaks at lunch and lobster at dinner.
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:31.503]  And he wants to go play golf with the black people and the brown people and the white people and he just wants to be happy.
[01:45:33.939 --> 01:45:42.686]  He's not like Prince Charles, now King Charles, that says we have to have a war against humanity and cut off the resources and shut down the farms and cut off the power.
[01:45:43.366 --> 01:45:45.608]  I mean, this is not even a discussion here.
[01:45:45.968 --> 01:45:49.691]  Yeah, there are people that want to kill you and rape you and slaughter you.
[01:45:50.512 --> 01:45:52.894]  There's also people that just want you to have a great life.
[01:45:55.496 --> 01:46:02.021]  But if you won't stand up for yourself now, then you deserve what you get.
[01:46:02.101 --> 01:46:02.722]  But I'll say this.
[01:46:03.729 --> 01:46:04.429]  I can sit back.
[01:46:04.489 --> 01:46:06.050]  I hear this from conservatives all the time.
[01:46:06.670 --> 01:46:07.030]  Screw it.
[01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.830]  Let it all go down.
[01:46:08.170 --> 01:46:09.110]  The liberals will pay.
[01:46:09.670 --> 01:46:10.951]  Who cares about the liberals?
[01:46:11.831 --> 01:46:13.291]  They're not even on my radar.
[01:46:13.331 --> 01:46:14.131]  I don't want to kill them.
[01:46:14.171 --> 01:46:14.852]  I don't want to help them.
[01:46:14.892 --> 01:46:15.832]  I just want them out of my life.
[01:46:16.632 --> 01:46:17.672]  What about the children?
[01:46:17.992 --> 01:46:18.852]  What about the widows?
[01:46:19.093 --> 01:46:19.933]  What about the veterans?
[01:46:20.153 --> 01:46:21.213]  What about the poor people?
[01:46:22.093 --> 01:46:24.774]  It's going to hurt them a lot worse than it hurts the degenerate left.
[01:46:25.714 --> 01:46:29.455]  My world is not about hurting the left because they're not important to me.
[01:46:30.868 --> 01:46:39.095]  My world is about helping and empowering the people because a rising tide, as John F. Kennedy said, raises all ships.
[01:46:41.016 --> 01:46:41.557]  It's that simple.
[01:46:43.598 --> 01:46:45.079]  Are we an economy of conquest?
[01:46:45.099 --> 01:46:47.761]  Or are we an economy of renaissance?
[01:46:48.502 --> 01:46:50.724]  Are we for the Great Reset or the Great Awakening?
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:56.623]  Folks, the globalists want control of all the life extension technology that's been developed.
[01:46:56.843 --> 01:46:59.684]  They want control of all this incredible science for themselves.
[01:46:59.704 --> 01:47:00.205]  They're greedy.
[01:47:00.425 --> 01:47:01.686]  They don't want you to have that.
[01:47:02.746 --> 01:47:04.187]  They've already got cures for cancer.
[01:47:04.227 --> 01:47:04.848]  They've got it all.
[01:47:05.028 --> 01:47:08.590]  You can live to 150 easy right now if you exercise and have the right treatments.
[01:47:08.930 --> 01:47:13.933]  And if you live that long, yes, then they can extend and extend and extend.
[01:47:14.354 --> 01:47:15.034]  We're there.
[01:47:15.394 --> 01:47:20.077]  But do you think they're going to give us all that technology that we developed?
[01:47:21.038 --> 01:47:21.138]  No.
[01:47:22.236 --> 01:47:30.448]  Instead they've given us poison shots that shred your testicles, destroy your ovaries, annihilate your brain, your cardiovascular system, everything.
[01:47:31.752 --> 01:47:32.633]  You're like, why would they do that?
[01:47:32.953 --> 01:47:41.278]  Because to a psychotic, the execution of power and hurting someone feels invigorating.
[01:47:41.598 --> 01:47:51.965]  A normal person just wants to have a nice life and be friendly and hang out with their family and watch sunsets and grill steaks and go see a football game and go to church and just be nice and friendly.
[01:47:52.285 --> 01:47:54.427]  You don't want power, you want to be successful and be comfortable.
[01:47:55.731 --> 01:47:57.071]  These people don't want that.
[01:47:57.371 --> 01:47:58.372]  They love it.
[01:47:58.592 --> 01:48:05.513]  To them, hurting a child, destroying a country, nuking something is beautiful because it means they've got power!
[01:48:07.673 --> 01:48:09.914]  Because they are Satanists.
[01:48:11.174 --> 01:48:15.575]  And the devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[01:48:15.595 --> 01:48:16.035]  Remember that?
[01:48:17.536 --> 01:48:18.576]  No one knows who first said it.
[01:48:19.276 --> 01:48:19.896]  Type in the quote.
[01:48:19.996 --> 01:48:22.797]  Who said... Type it in.
[01:48:23.557 --> 01:48:24.177]  Who said...
[01:48:26.297 --> 01:48:31.543]  The devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[01:48:31.563 --> 01:48:33.365]  Because last time I searched it, they didn't know who said it.
[01:48:34.046 --> 01:48:36.909]  But it doesn't matter who said it.
[01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:39.152]  You know it's true.
[01:48:40.173 --> 01:48:42.035]  And you know they're doing this.
[01:48:43.777 --> 01:48:45.980]  So why in Hades would you put up with it?
[01:48:50.054 --> 01:48:51.515]  Trump hopes the economy crashes.
[01:48:51.575 --> 01:48:51.756]  No.
[01:48:52.436 --> 01:48:55.178]  He's doing everything he can to stop that from happening.
[01:48:55.819 --> 01:48:57.100]  But he's being honest with you.
[01:48:58.761 --> 01:49:02.445]  Charles... ...Baldier?
[01:49:02.585 --> 01:49:03.285]  Is that what he said?
[01:49:06.008 --> 01:49:07.029]  No, that's a movie.
[01:49:08.450 --> 01:49:13.934]  It's a 1995 movie, The Usual Suspects, both set... Oh, he's credited the movie.
[01:49:14.835 --> 01:49:15.756]  So the poet said it.
[01:49:16.016 --> 01:49:16.677]  Click on the poet.
[01:49:17.898 --> 01:49:21.180]  The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[01:49:21.861 --> 01:49:23.202]  That's damn right.
[01:49:24.523 --> 01:49:26.164]  That is 100% right.
[01:49:26.204 --> 01:49:27.405]  So how do you say it, Charles?
[01:49:30.007 --> 01:49:30.588]  Boldier?
[01:49:32.929 --> 01:49:33.450]  Boldier.
[01:49:35.671 --> 01:49:38.614]  So, stop denying evil exists.
[01:49:39.674 --> 01:49:42.937]  Stop lying to yourself and tell you're not under attack.
[01:49:44.116 --> 01:49:48.081]  Stop thinking, oh, I can just decide this isn't happening and it makes it all go away.
[01:49:48.321 --> 01:49:49.903]  Because that's not how the universe works.
[01:49:51.404 --> 01:49:52.686]  God wants you to stand up.
[01:49:53.207 --> 01:49:54.468]  God wants you to speak out.
[01:49:54.788 --> 01:49:56.270]  God wants you to face this.
[01:49:56.590 --> 01:49:58.212]  And God wants you to overcome it.
[01:49:59.774 --> 01:50:02.217]  But if you won't do that, God's not going to help you.
[01:50:02.617 --> 01:50:04.660]  God wants you to make the right move.
[01:50:07.230 --> 01:50:22.914]  To have courage, to have love, to have honor, and then as soon as you in faith say, I'm gonna tell the truth, I'm gonna stand up for what's right, then God steps in and points the way, lays the groundwork, does it all.
[01:50:24.074 --> 01:50:38.624]   And every time you're tough and trust in God, and every time you get attacked and say, God, I don't blame you, thank you, God says, good faithful servant, Now I will empower you even more.
[01:50:40.085 --> 01:50:42.826]  And then God comes to you and says, are you willing to die?
[01:50:43.627 --> 01:50:44.708]  Yes, God, I'm willing to die.
[01:50:45.268 --> 01:50:51.492]  Well, I'm probably not gonna need to do that right now, but just in case, you're willing to die.
[01:50:52.792 --> 01:50:54.013]  Yes, I'm willing to die.
[01:50:55.314 --> 01:50:57.435]  And God says, the floodgates are now open.
[01:50:58.396 --> 01:51:05.895]   You're now willing to lay your life down like my son did, for the people, But I know you're weak.
[01:51:05.915 --> 01:51:09.438]  You're not as one trillionth as strong as my son.
[01:51:09.458 --> 01:51:12.862]  But I'm going to now lift you up.
[01:51:14.323 --> 01:51:23.029]   But you know at the right point, at the day appointed, if I need you, To be put in prison or destroyed, is that what you want?
[01:51:23.849 --> 01:51:29.292]  Unlike Satan promising unlimited power and sex and all this crap, God doesn't do that.
[01:51:29.312 --> 01:51:42.339]  God comes and says, I'm offering you a really rough road, but you say you want to help children, you say you want to fight evil, you say you want to be strong, you say... And I say, yes, I want that.
[01:51:43.359 --> 01:51:51.401]  When God literally first came to me, throughout my life, but really intensely 26, 27 years ago, God didn't show me all the good stuff that came.
[01:51:52.941 --> 01:51:53.982]  God said, you love children?
[01:51:54.502 --> 01:51:55.162]  You want to fight evil?
[01:51:55.722 --> 01:51:56.122]  I see that.
[01:51:56.142 --> 01:51:56.562]  I hear that.
[01:51:56.782 --> 01:51:57.202]  I feel it.
[01:51:58.163 --> 01:51:59.943]  But do you really want to do it?
[01:52:01.143 --> 01:52:02.404]  Are you really ready to take it?
[01:52:03.184 --> 01:52:04.684]  Are you really ready to stand up, son?
[01:52:05.845 --> 01:52:07.445]  And I said, yeah, I want the job.
[01:52:08.902 --> 01:52:14.726]  God said, well, I'm going to give it to you, but I'm going to give it to you one piece at a time to make sure it's what you want to do.
[01:52:15.567 --> 01:52:21.911]  And the more I took the attacks and the more I took the burden, the stronger I got and the closer to God I got each minute.
[01:52:22.592 --> 01:52:32.359]  Until now, I'm at a point now where God finally, finally, in just the last six months, it's so amazing, does not even ask anymore.
[01:52:36.854 --> 01:52:37.615]  God just does it.
[01:52:38.455 --> 01:52:41.237]  I'm finally achieving what I asked for.
[01:52:42.498 --> 01:52:44.059]  I've prayed that prayer a thousand times.
[01:52:44.099 --> 01:52:45.801]  Look, I don't want to think anymore.
[01:52:46.401 --> 01:52:47.362]  I don't want to be possessed.
[01:52:47.482 --> 01:52:50.144]  I know this isn't Satanism, but will you just take me over?
[01:52:50.544 --> 01:52:51.285]  You know what to do.
[01:52:51.325 --> 01:52:54.847]  And God goes, no, you still got free will, but I need to see what you're going to do.
[01:52:54.907 --> 01:53:02.733]  And finally, finally, the last vestiges of my resistance to God are being removed.
[01:53:02.873 --> 01:53:08.053]   Finally, finally, It's flowing through straight.
[01:53:09.054 --> 01:53:10.094]  Straighter than I've ever seen it.
[01:53:10.494 --> 01:53:11.534]  Stronger every day.
[01:53:11.854 --> 01:53:14.255]  What the enemy feared, what they knew was coming.
[01:53:16.956 --> 01:53:17.536]  And I'm nothing.
[01:53:18.596 --> 01:53:20.476]  All of you are going to have the same experience.
[01:53:20.937 --> 01:53:26.458]  Or you've already had this experience and you know it at a fundamental cellular level.
[01:53:27.892 --> 01:53:28.792]  That's amazing.
[01:53:29.072 --> 01:53:30.213]  That's spectacular.
[01:53:30.493 --> 01:53:31.433]  That's divine.
[01:53:31.753 --> 01:53:32.914]  That is empowering.
[01:53:32.994 --> 01:53:35.515]  That is everything you need to know.
[01:53:35.875 --> 01:53:37.856]  You don't die and go away.
[01:53:39.156 --> 01:53:42.697]  You're an eternal being of light manifesting in this body.
[01:53:42.837 --> 01:53:44.038]  God is real.
[01:53:44.058 --> 01:53:45.598]  That's the good news.
[01:53:46.779 --> 01:53:47.659]  Yes, we're fallen.
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:49.900]  Yes, we're distorted.
[01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:55.422]  But God will slowly rebuild us in his image.
[01:53:57.369 --> 01:53:58.009]  Think about that.
[01:53:59.210 --> 01:54:00.391]  God's real.
[01:54:00.951 --> 01:54:02.172]  God's real.
[01:54:02.692 --> 01:54:03.853]  God is real.
[01:54:04.253 --> 01:54:05.174]  God is eternal.
[01:54:05.234 --> 01:54:06.454]  God is all-powerful.
[01:54:06.535 --> 01:54:10.877]  God made everything before, now, and coming after this.
[01:54:11.638 --> 01:54:16.280]  And just to be part of that consciousness.
[01:54:16.701 --> 01:54:19.782]  We are not God, but we are part of God's consciousness.
[01:54:19.823 --> 01:54:22.104]  God is experiencing life through us.
[01:54:24.685 --> 01:54:25.346]  That's incredible.
[01:54:26.906 --> 01:54:27.886]  That's transcendent.
[01:54:27.966 --> 01:54:30.127]  That's everything we need.
[01:54:30.428 --> 01:54:34.609]  That's full commitment, full fulfillment, total completion.
[01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:49.616]  To experience the third heaven, as King David did, which I've only been blessed a few times to enter, is not a feeling of exhilaration, not a feeling of pleasure, but it's beyond any ecstasy you can imagine.
[01:54:51.157 --> 01:54:58.221]   It is a feeling of timelessness, And total infinity completion.
[01:54:59.542 --> 01:54:59.942]  Total.
[01:55:01.243 --> 01:55:02.184]  There is no time.
[01:55:02.484 --> 01:55:03.345]  There is no past.
[01:55:03.365 --> 01:55:04.185]  There is no future.
[01:55:04.386 --> 01:55:12.551]  There's only the presence of God and absolute wonderment and worship and fulfillment and it's indescribable.
[01:55:12.932 --> 01:55:21.110]   And once you've experienced one trillionth of a second of that presence, Nothing else matters.
[01:55:21.891 --> 01:55:23.332]  Last night, I had a deep dream.
[01:55:24.212 --> 01:55:25.253]  I woke up at 4 a.m.
[01:55:25.333 --> 01:55:30.437]  after I'd had it, and Satan had come into my house to kill my family.
[01:55:31.398 --> 01:55:44.709]  Satan was manifest in my home, coming to destroy me, coming with his power, and was coming to intimidate me, and coming with all these horrible thoughts, and all this evil, and all this download of destruction, and torture, and murder.
[01:55:45.965 --> 01:55:50.734]  And Satan's like, I'm in this room in your house and you don't have the courage to come face me.
[01:55:51.034 --> 01:55:57.105]  And I instantly had no feeling of fear because I had Jesus Christ and I said, Alex Jones isn't coming into that room.
[01:55:58.564 --> 01:56:01.666]  Jesus Christ's servant, and the Spirit of the Lord's coming in.
[01:56:01.927 --> 01:56:19.541]  And in that dream, I marched in last night, into that room, and Satan was right there laughing at me, and I said, in the name of Jesus Christ, go back to hell, Christ conquered hell, and the chains of hell and death, and the keys to death, in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, be gone!
[01:56:22.283 --> 01:56:27.427]  And Satan literally, before me, fell into a black hole.
[01:56:29.854 --> 01:56:46.052]  descended into hell. All the starkness comes in.
[01:56:44.004 --> 01:56:44.664]  All these threats.
[01:56:44.824 --> 01:56:45.885]  All this stuff to my family.
[01:56:46.366 --> 01:56:47.266]  A trillion thoughts.
[01:56:48.167 --> 01:56:49.508]  A swarm of darkness.
[01:56:51.849 --> 01:56:55.512]  And I'm like, I don't want to go into that room.
[01:56:55.552 --> 01:56:56.693]  And God said, I'm with you.
[01:56:56.713 --> 01:56:58.034]  Go into that room in my name right now.
[01:56:58.074 --> 01:56:59.275]  And I marched into that room.
[01:57:00.316 --> 01:57:05.218]  And Satan had fear in his eyes, not because of me, but he that was in me.
[01:57:07.219 --> 01:57:13.142]  And Satan, literally in front of me, fell into a hole to hell.
[01:57:15.303 --> 01:57:16.244]  That is what they fear.
[01:57:18.805 --> 01:57:21.467]  He that is in me is greater than he that is in the earth.
[01:57:24.248 --> 01:57:31.264]   Our God is God, not some little twisted Creature that seeks to hurt the servants of God.
[01:57:31.284 --> 01:57:35.706]  I want to thank you all for your support and your prayers.
[01:57:35.886 --> 01:57:37.026]  But this is a spiritual battle.
[01:57:37.046 --> 01:57:37.627]  Make no mistake.
[01:57:42.128 --> 01:57:43.209]  And I looked into that door.
[01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:46.470]  And I said, I don't want to go in there.
[01:57:46.490 --> 01:57:47.811]  And God said, go in there.
[01:57:47.871 --> 01:57:49.211]  And I was energized.
[01:57:50.272 --> 01:57:51.192]  And I marched in.
[01:57:51.212 --> 01:57:53.113]  And I told Satan, go to hell.
[01:57:56.841 --> 01:57:57.942]  A warning to America.
[01:57:57.962 --> 01:57:59.763]  25 ways the U.S.
[01:57:59.823 --> 01:58:01.864]  is being destroyed in under 2 minutes.

[01:58:15.591 --> 01:58:14.590]  5.
[01:58:16.071 --> 01:58:18.012]  The educational indoctrination of children.
[01:58:18.972 --> 01:58:18.012]  6.
[01:58:19.593 --> 01:58:22.954]  The asymmetrical weaponization of justice.
[01:58:22.974 --> 01:58:22.954]  7.
[01:58:23.575 --> 01:58:25.336]  The destruction of private property rights.
[01:58:26.852 --> 01:58:28.893]  Inflation and debt.
[01:58:28.913 --> 01:58:28.893]  9.
[01:58:29.313 --> 01:58:31.994]  The global depopulation agenda.
[01:58:32.014 --> 01:58:31.994]  10.
[01:58:32.675 --> 01:58:35.936]  Record low fertility and plummeting birth rates.
[01:58:35.956 --> 01:58:35.936]  11.
[01:58:36.336 --> 01:58:38.957]  Unaccountable federal bureaucracies.
[01:58:38.977 --> 01:58:38.957]  12.
[01:58:39.297 --> 01:58:40.298]  Toxic food supply.

[01:58:42.079 --> 01:58:43.899]  Vaccine and pandemic disinformation.

[01:59:27.455 --> 01:59:29.916]  We interrupt this program to bring you a special report.
[01:59:30.655 --> 01:59:32.097]  America has been captured.
[01:59:32.197 --> 01:59:33.698]  We have an occupied government.
[01:59:34.078 --> 01:59:47.551]  Any loyal American who does not want to be a complete slave of a biomedical extermination operation needs to get in form quick, get right with God, and then start telling everybody you know about it and not complying with the system.
[01:59:47.891 --> 01:59:49.512]  The system is here to destroy us.
[01:59:49.893 --> 01:59:51.674]  Complying with it will get you killed.
[01:59:52.735 --> 02:00:02.335]   period if you are receiving this transmission you are the
[02:00:02.335 --> 02:00:20.735]   resistance [Music]
[02:00:20.735 --> 02:00:30.735]  [Music]
[02:00:30.735 --> 02:00:33.565]   the answer to 1980 1774 is 1776!
[02:00:34.206 --> 02:00:33.565]  1776!
[02:00:34.826 --> 02:00:48.737]  So this fight for America is key, not just for us, but the entire world.
[02:00:49.297 --> 02:01:01.686]   Because if this republic falls, the entire world falls to the UN and the globalists and their hellish plan to literally take everything Well, we got news for them!
[02:01:01.525 --> 02:01:08.204]   away from you. And whether it's Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates or Yuval Noah Harari, they represent
[02:01:08.204 --> 02:01:15.204]   the globalist ruling class of the planet who say the future is not human. Well, we got
[02:01:15.204 --> 02:01:22.204]  news for them. The future is not globalist!
[02:01:22.204 --> 02:01:25.485]  [Applause]
[02:01:25.485 --> 02:01:26.885]  The future is human.
[02:01:27.664 --> 02:01:33.485]  The lies they spread about Alex, they've tried to take him out more than they've tried to take any of us out.
[02:01:34.026 --> 02:01:35.126]  But let me tell you what it is.
[02:01:35.166 --> 02:01:48.088]  What they'll never say is that Alex Jones has spent 30 years being the loudest voice for freedom, for liberty, and for anti-war that this world has seen.
[02:01:48.368 --> 02:01:52.009]  He stood against them, and that's why they're against him.
[02:01:53.268 --> 02:01:59.913]  Well, they have tried to burn him to the ground, but he won't stop fighting!
[02:02:00.554 --> 02:02:02.235]  Let's launch Team Humanity!
[02:02:05.258 --> 02:02:06.519]  Team Humanity!
[02:02:09.781 --> 02:02:10.962]  Team Humanity!
[02:02:13.484 --> 02:02:16.927]  Are you going to let them brainwash and take your children?
[02:02:18.891 --> 02:02:29.157]  The answer to their 1984 anti-human dehumanization world is humanity coming together and celebrating freedom that God gave us and saying no!
[02:02:29.337 --> 02:02:31.978]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[02:02:32.078 --> 02:02:38.382]  So I have a message to the globalists.
[02:02:39.122 --> 02:02:45.306]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[02:02:48.820 --> 02:02:51.142]  They declared war on us.
[02:02:52.003 --> 02:02:53.044]  They're attacking us.
[02:02:53.384 --> 02:02:54.445]  They're surveilling us.
[02:02:54.785 --> 02:02:55.786]  They're censoring us.
[02:02:56.127 --> 02:02:59.830]  They're cutting off our energy, our water, our communications, our freedom.
[02:03:00.150 --> 02:03:04.594]  We're simply recognizing it and saying, we're not gonna roll over and die.
[02:03:05.035 --> 02:03:10.460]  Our God is the God of the universe that created all, and your little God, Satan, is a loser!
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:16.164]  There is a global, worldwide, political realignment against the New World Order.
[02:03:16.484 --> 02:03:26.632]  The New World Order is a couple thousand arrogant people led by King Charles, who sits around and talks about how he wants to depopulate people, and so did his father, Prince Philip.
[02:03:27.193 --> 02:03:32.737]  And I'm telling them right now, we are not rolling over and dying for you inbred globalists!
[02:03:36.408 --> 02:03:39.271]  You will not divide and conquer us any longer!
[02:03:39.632 --> 02:03:43.632]  And as long as we never give up, we are invincible.
[02:03:43.632 --> 02:03:46.632]  [crowd cheering]
[02:03:47.632 --> 02:03:50.632]  [crowd chanting]

[02:04:42.622 --> 02:04:47.806]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[02:05:08.687 --> 02:05:10.368]  You know how he walks.
[02:05:10.388 --> 02:05:12.230]  Like a demonic elf.
[02:05:12.550 --> 02:05:13.371]  I'm Bill Gates!
[02:05:13.471 --> 02:05:16.534]  And Angelina Jolie going, ah, children!
[02:05:16.694 --> 02:05:17.915]  I am Arnold Schwarzenegger!
[02:05:18.035 --> 02:05:19.176]  I'm Piers Morgan.
[02:05:19.115 --> 02:05:21.115]  Ever seen a Chowinni?
[02:05:21.115 --> 02:05:23.115]  My name's Glenn Beck.
[02:05:23.115 --> 02:05:26.115]  [Growling]
[02:05:26.115 --> 02:05:27.115]  That's Hillary.
[02:05:27.358 --> 02:05:29.719]  Hold on, I'm Gary Johnson.
[02:05:29.899 --> 02:05:33.641]  Hi, this is Barack Obama without my teleprompter.
[02:05:34.281 --> 02:05:38.143]  I was raised by the Ford Foundation and Carnegie Endowment.
[02:05:38.383 --> 02:05:40.224]  Welcome to McDonald's, may I help you?
[02:05:40.284 --> 02:05:41.245]  I'm Benny Sanders.
[02:05:41.425 --> 02:05:43.366]  Chris Hayes with glasses like he's a little smart guy.
[02:05:43.806 --> 02:05:44.867]  Rachel Maddow!
[02:05:44.987 --> 02:05:45.727]  Hey, hey, hey!
[02:05:45.927 --> 02:05:47.748]  Thank you, Satan, for all your love.
[02:05:47.889 --> 02:05:48.449]  Shining to me.
[02:05:49.049 --> 02:05:54.250]  I am Optimus Prime.
[02:05:54.430 --> 02:05:58.131]  I am William F. Buckley Edison.
[02:05:59.931 --> 02:06:03.931]   Visit Infowarsstore.com today and be the reason we're still on the air.
[02:06:03.931 --> 02:06:10.931]   Visit Infowarsstore.com today and be the reason we're still on the air.
[02:06:10.931 --> 02:06:11.931]  corruption.
[02:06:12.075 --> 02:06:17.236]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:19.208 --> 02:06:27.792]  All right, he is the main financial expert for the most devastating research on them, with patents having COVID-19 ready years before.
[02:06:27.812 --> 02:06:30.514]  Dr. David Martin is sitting here at 3 p.m.
[02:06:30.554 --> 02:06:31.274]  today after the show.
[02:06:31.914 --> 02:06:35.516]  So we will tape the show, and then the interview will air tomorrow.
[02:06:36.837 --> 02:06:47.562]  All right, so Maria Z's got a big guest coming up, fourth hour, so I was going to move her, she understood, but we don't have to now because Martin was called into the legislature in meetings with some big moves.
[02:06:50.249 --> 02:06:52.130]  It's still there at the legislature, but he'll be here at 3.
[02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:54.690]  Now, let's talk about why this is so important.
[02:06:56.371 --> 02:07:04.974]  They're so arrogant that Obama created COVID-19, it was a big scandal, 2014-15, and then they moved it to Wuhan because of it.
[02:07:04.994 --> 02:07:07.074]  We're going to get all the receipts and all the documents tomorrow.
[02:07:07.495 --> 02:07:11.816]  We've talked about it a lot over the years here, but it's good to recap it, give the new information, and put it all together.
[02:07:15.018 --> 02:07:19.981]  All the major medical journals, New England Medical Journal, British Medical Journal, they're all okay.
[02:07:21.022 --> 02:07:24.584]  People are like, why'd it go from 22 million dead, you've been saying for a year, to suddenly 35?
[02:07:24.624 --> 02:07:25.585]  Why'd it jump?
[02:07:25.605 --> 02:07:27.226]  You only get the number a year later.
[02:07:27.786 --> 02:07:29.267]  And the number's always a year behind.
[02:07:30.107 --> 02:07:37.112]  So in 2023, the number's 35 million dead from the shots.
[02:07:37.232 --> 02:07:38.152]  Insurance company numbers.
[02:07:38.893 --> 02:07:42.355]  40 plus percent overall, all cause morbidity.
[02:07:43.116 --> 02:07:43.656]  That means deaths.
[02:07:44.818 --> 02:07:46.939]  World War Two, World War One were below 10%, 8-9%.
[02:07:47.059 --> 02:07:49.080]  I'm going to say it again.
[02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:54.522]  We got more people dying, according to insurance companies, than died in World War One and World War Two.
[02:07:55.742 --> 02:07:57.943]  And they're young people, they're old people, they're children.
[02:07:58.863 --> 02:08:09.448]  And we've got, because of the whistleblower, who was the head of the whole database, that meant he was the head of the database, he integrated all the database, the government had it, who took shots, who died, they were almost all, 99% took the shot.
[02:08:09.268 --> 02:08:18.268]   99% took the shot. So, Mississippi, Louisiana, Missouri, Kansas, and now Texas.
[02:08:18.268 --> 02:08:28.268]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:08:19.370 --> 02:08:21.051]  That's what Dr. Martin's here for.
[02:08:22.993 --> 02:08:29.077]  Aren't just getting ready and have already filed civil suits, they're getting ready with criminal charges.
[02:08:29.117 --> 02:08:33.720]  We're not gonna do like they do going after Trump with some fake charge.
[02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:36.461]  Why go after just, you know, their leader?
[02:08:37.322 --> 02:08:38.463]  We'll go after their mothership.
[02:08:40.034 --> 02:08:45.578]  And that's Big Pharma and the people at the top of the Pentagon that developed this with Obama.
[02:08:46.999 --> 02:08:47.860]  So here's the headline.
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:48.700]  It begins.
[02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:50.061]  Kansas sues Pfizer.
[02:08:50.581 --> 02:08:53.383]  State alleges company new of serious adverse events.
[02:08:53.784 --> 02:08:56.365]  Yet mark COVID-19 vaccine is safe.
[02:08:57.386 --> 02:09:00.088]  And they have the whistleblowers.
[02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:04.731]  The Robert F. Kennedy and Robert Barnes and others.
[02:09:06.052 --> 02:09:06.813]  They have the receipts.
[02:09:08.905 --> 02:09:09.465]  Next article.
[02:09:09.885 --> 02:09:12.326]  Doctors shock COVID vaccines make people retarded.
[02:09:12.426 --> 02:09:12.947]  Big study.
[02:09:14.928 --> 02:09:15.368]  Breaking.
[02:09:17.088 --> 02:09:22.171]  Majority of studies on the topic indicate COVID injections do cause menstrual problems.
[02:09:23.191 --> 02:09:24.291]  You gotta tax your fertility.
[02:09:26.372 --> 02:09:28.513]  mRNA vaccine off switch discovered.
[02:09:30.634 --> 02:09:32.355]  Fauci joins Cobert.
[02:09:33.413 --> 02:09:39.736]  To the Colbert Report to sarcastically say he's the one for COVID-19 and made a billion on vaccines.
[02:09:40.096 --> 02:09:41.477]  No, he only made a hundred billion himself.
[02:09:42.918 --> 02:09:44.838]  So I want to play those clips and go to our special guest.
[02:09:44.878 --> 02:09:47.880]  The reason I wanted him on is I've been on some spaces with him.
[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:49.421]  Very articulate, very smart.
[02:09:50.221 --> 02:09:53.843]  He's on record a EMT.
[02:09:55.243 --> 02:09:56.504]  And they're where the rubber meets the road.
[02:09:58.959 --> 02:10:04.121]  I don't need to be a scientist to know if we all go eat at a restaurant and my whole family gets sick that was food poisoning.
[02:10:04.362 --> 02:10:07.523]  Then you see in the newspaper, hey, 50 people got sick at this restaurant, you know about it.
[02:10:08.464 --> 02:10:13.086]  But we have the pathologists, we have the epidemiologists, we have the turbo cancer reports.
[02:10:13.186 --> 02:10:14.827]  We know the infertility is plunging.
[02:10:15.107 --> 02:10:16.948]  We know the blood clots are exploding.
[02:10:16.968 --> 02:10:19.689]  We know there's TV ads, oh, kids have heart attacks now, it's totally normal.
[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:22.061]  We have the insurance company numbers.
[02:10:22.161 --> 02:10:24.102]  We know this has happened.
[02:10:24.463 --> 02:10:28.145]  And they're gaslighting like the press secretary saying, Oh, Biden's not bumbling.
[02:10:28.465 --> 02:10:29.246]  Biden's great.
[02:10:29.286 --> 02:10:30.106]  He's smarter than ever.
[02:10:30.367 --> 02:10:31.727]  That's all deep fakes.
[02:10:31.828 --> 02:10:33.008]  No, it's live TV.
[02:10:35.090 --> 02:10:39.433]  So they are so desperate now doing nothing but gaslighting.
[02:10:39.453 --> 02:10:52.783]   So I want to play a clip of the Kansas leadership and Attorney General Talking about what they're doing.
[02:10:52.823 --> 02:10:56.366]  We'll go to our guest because I wanted my guest on months ago.
[02:10:56.426 --> 02:11:01.891]  We've got him on now, but I noticed they've got these sock puppet accounts of fake doctors saying, you're not an EMT.
[02:11:01.911 --> 02:11:02.591]  You're lying.
[02:11:02.671 --> 02:11:03.212]  I'm a doctor.
[02:11:03.232 --> 02:11:03.792]  Everything's great.
[02:11:04.152 --> 02:11:04.853]  No, it's not great.
[02:11:04.873 --> 02:11:06.134]  We have the insurance company numbers.
[02:11:06.414 --> 02:11:07.595]  We have the mainline studies.
[02:11:07.975 --> 02:11:09.897]  They admit the shot didn't work for what they said.
[02:11:09.957 --> 02:11:10.738]  It's killing people.
[02:11:11.138 --> 02:11:15.562]  And we're going to remember and find out how they were paid because, you know, Colbert is on record.
[02:11:15.602 --> 02:11:16.342]  So is Rachel Maddow.
[02:11:16.663 --> 02:11:18.004]  So are all these talk show hosts.
[02:11:19.028 --> 02:11:22.629]  Rachel Maddow was paid millions in 2021 and 2022.
[02:11:23.009 --> 02:11:30.210]  Herself, in one week, she was paid $800-something thousand dollars, look it up, to push the Pfizer shot.
[02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:33.471]  Yeah, 30 pieces of silver for Judas Iscariot.
[02:11:36.131 --> 02:11:43.793]  So she'll stand, and so will these other people at Nuremberg, too, for what they've done.
[02:11:48.365 --> 02:11:53.567]  I follow what our guest is about to cover, Harry Fisher, and how they're attacking him.
[02:11:54.347 --> 02:11:59.989]  And that's good, because we can then illuminate and laze who the enemies are.
[02:12:01.789 --> 02:12:03.450]  And we can then know who the operatives are.
[02:12:04.330 --> 02:12:07.271]  And who the people are that want to aid and abet this mass murder.
[02:12:07.491 --> 02:12:08.611]  But I bet on humanity.
[02:12:08.731 --> 02:12:09.672]  I bet on you.
[02:12:10.792 --> 02:12:12.192]  And I know you want the truth.
[02:12:13.653 --> 02:12:14.993]  So they bet on their system?
[02:12:15.073 --> 02:12:15.353]  Great.
[02:12:15.433 --> 02:12:16.354]  We're betting on you.
[02:12:16.934 --> 02:12:17.394]  Here's the clue.
[02:12:18.933 --> 02:12:22.337]  Pfizer marketed its vaccine as safe for pregnant women.
[02:12:23.198 --> 02:12:32.007]  However, in February of 2021, Pfizer possessed reports for 458 pregnant women who received Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy.
[02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:42.396]  More than half of the pregnant women reported an adverse event, and more than 10% reported a miscarriage, many within days of the vaccination.
[02:12:42.416 --> 02:12:56.724]  Pfizer also possessed information from its own October 2020 study on pregnancy in rats, indicating that its COVID-19 vaccine was likely linked to infertility, loss of litters, and stillborn offspring.
[02:12:58.225 --> 02:13:02.208]  Number two, safety relating to heart conditions like myocarditis.
[02:13:03.356 --> 02:13:12.203]  Pfizer consistently denied any evidence of a connection or safety signal between its COVID-19 vaccine and myocarditis or pericarditis.
[02:13:13.544 --> 02:13:27.776]  Indeed, on January 18, 2023, when asked whether its vaccine caused strokes or myocarditis, Pfizer chairman and CEO Alan Berla stated, quote, we've not seen a single signal, although we have distributed billions of doses.
[02:13:28.476 --> 02:13:28.937]  End quote.
[02:13:29.618 --> 02:13:33.883]  A signal that he was referring to as a safety signal, which refers to a negative consequence.
[02:13:34.664 --> 02:13:44.637]  However, as Pfizer knew, the United States government, the United States military, foreign governments, and others had found that Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine caused myocarditis and pericarditis.
[02:13:45.896 --> 02:13:48.397]  Number three, effectiveness regarding variants.
[02:13:48.797 --> 02:14:00.242]  Pfizer also claimed that its COVID-19 vaccine protected against COVID-19 variants, even though data available at the time showed Pfizer's vaccine was effective less than half the time against variants.
[02:14:01.263 --> 02:14:02.223]  Finally, transmission.
[02:14:02.243 --> 02:14:13.148]  Pfizer urged Americans to get vaccinated in order to protect their loved ones, clearly indicating a claim that Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccination stopped transmission of COVID-19.
[02:14:14.304 --> 02:14:24.970]  Pfizer later admitted that it had never even studied transmission of it after its recipients received the vaccine and whether they could say it stopped transmission.
[02:14:27.132 --> 02:14:33.355]  After making these misleading statements, Pfizer also engaged in some censorship attempts.
[02:14:34.256 --> 02:14:42.541]  Emails revealed that Pfizer officials coordinated with social media platforms to censor any speech critical of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness.
[02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:53.544]  It should also be noted that Pfizer elected not to join the federal government's vaccine development program, known as Operation Warp Speed, and declined that development funding.
[02:14:54.345 --> 02:15:07.050]  When asked about that, Pfizer's CEO, Albert Bourla, said Pfizer did not participate in the program in order to, quote, liberate, end quote, Pfizer's scientists and to avoid government oversight of its vaccine development.
[02:15:07.751 --> 02:15:10.011]  He also said, quote, they want reports.
[02:15:10.692 --> 02:15:13.413]  I don't want to have any of that, end quote.
[02:15:13.959 --> 02:15:16.769]  Referring to they, when he said they, he was referring to the federal government.
[02:15:17.642 --> 02:15:21.604]  Pfizer's misleading statements contributed to success in marketing its vaccine in Kansas.
[02:15:22.264 --> 02:15:29.327]  By February of 2024, Pfizer had delivered over 3.3 million doses of its vaccine in the state of Kansas.
[02:15:29.827 --> 02:15:36.010]  This accounted for over 60% of all vaccine doses given in the state of Kansas.
[02:15:36.850 --> 02:15:46.094]  The suit is being filed today, and as I mentioned before, it is part of a multi-state effort in which more suits may follow depending on Pfizer's reaction.
[02:15:47.409 --> 02:15:48.550]  Nice to see you again, Doctor.
[02:15:48.610 --> 02:15:52.211]  Good to be with you, Stephen.
[02:15:52.332 --> 02:15:53.592]  Always a pleasure to have you on.
[02:15:53.672 --> 02:15:56.314]  I gotta say, you are a spry 83 years old.
[02:15:56.134 --> 02:15:58.134]  83 years old.
[02:15:58.134 --> 02:16:04.134]  Have you thought about running for president?
[02:16:05.043 --> 02:16:06.504]  No, no interest whatsoever.
[02:16:06.864 --> 02:16:12.129]  Well, you served under six, seven presidents, okay.
[02:16:13.650 --> 02:16:17.834]  Politicization of science is dangerous, but it's not a new thing.
[02:16:18.995 --> 02:16:21.117]  This has happened in the past, you've dealt with it in the past.
[02:16:22.478 --> 02:16:25.099]  Have you seen anything like the way it is now, though?
[02:16:25.139 --> 02:16:29.722]  Because certainly, just a few days ago, your testimony down in Washington, D.C.
[02:16:29.742 --> 02:16:31.983]  made headlines for the hostility that you received.
[02:16:32.283 --> 02:16:32.804]  Right.
[02:16:32.924 --> 02:16:38.487]  Is this, even for your long, historic career, being involved with all these politicians, does this seem like something new to you?
[02:16:39.247 --> 02:16:40.728]  Quite new and disturbing.
[02:16:41.788 --> 02:16:49.311]  Back when I first became director of the Institute, which was, you know, I've been director, I had been director for almost 40 years.
[02:16:49.932 --> 02:16:55.894]  In the beginning there was always politics, you know, there was people of different ideology, there was center, center left, center right.
[02:16:56.414 --> 02:17:04.380]   They disagreed and They, you know, sometimes would argue with each other, but at the end of the day, there was civility and respect for each other.
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.862]  What we're seeing now is what you had mentioned, Stephen.
[02:17:08.062 --> 02:17:10.304]  It's vitriol and pure hostility.
[02:17:10.384 --> 02:17:25.536]   So I would get questioned in a very strict, pushing way, maybe back in other administrations, but at the end of the hearing, They would come over to you and say, you know, good job, you know, sorry that we had to be tough with our questionings, but, you know, we want to get to the right place.
[02:17:26.056 --> 02:17:36.024]  Now, it's pure attack, which is totally... It's just, I believe, a reflection of the profound degree of divisiveness in the country, which is very destructive.
[02:17:36.144 --> 02:17:42.149]  Okay, well, you know, you're a... They're trying to prop up this mass murderer, but we have the receipts.
[02:17:42.229 --> 02:17:44.171]  It's coming up in the interview tomorrow with...
[02:17:44.975 --> 02:17:50.578]  The doctor we've got joining us, Dr. David Martin, to go over the financial evidence.
[02:17:50.598 --> 02:17:52.799]  We have total proof tomorrow.
[02:17:52.819 --> 02:17:56.720]  I'm going to do the interview today after the show, but I wanted to go to Harry Fisher for the balance of the hour.
[02:17:56.740 --> 02:17:59.021]  A little bit the next hour, the Maria Z's taking over with a big guest.
[02:17:59.802 --> 02:18:03.103]  She's got Harry Fisher is a EMT.
[02:18:04.224 --> 02:18:08.786]  He is 1997 and a paramedic since 2013.
[02:18:09.186 --> 02:18:22.415]   Currently a contract medic who has been doing contacts Since COVID, he has worked in ER, ICU, and ambulances all over from New York to South Dakota, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Alaska.
[02:18:22.555 --> 02:18:28.159]  Harry Fisher, EMTP on X. So, Harry, you're under a lot of attack.
[02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:29.320]  We have all the statistics.
[02:18:29.340 --> 02:18:29.801]  We have the numbers.
[02:18:29.821 --> 02:18:30.521]  We know you're right.
[02:18:31.102 --> 02:18:33.043]  But they're so scared of you speaking out.
[02:18:33.083 --> 02:18:36.887]  They're really attacking you to try to intimidate other medical workers.
[02:18:37.227 --> 02:18:38.007]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:18:38.067 --> 02:18:39.449]  I've talked to you on Spaces on X.
[02:18:40.851 --> 02:18:43.613]  Go wherever you want, big picture, and then drill down into it.
[02:18:44.093 --> 02:18:46.915]  And then if we've got time into the next hour, I'll take a little bit of Maria Z's time.
[02:18:46.935 --> 02:18:53.740]  I'll open the phones up just for fellow medical workers to call in with their response.
[02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:55.041]  But thank you for being here, sir.
[02:18:56.482 --> 02:18:57.623]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:18:57.683 --> 02:18:59.043]  I appreciate it.
[02:18:59.804 --> 02:19:00.645]  It's been a long road.
[02:19:01.365 --> 02:19:03.807]  As you know, you've been fighting through it as well.
[02:19:03.907 --> 02:19:07.209]  But as a medical worker, I'm a paramedic, EMT paramedic.
[02:19:07.229 --> 02:19:09.831]  I've been doing this a good while, as you mentioned.
[02:19:10.928 --> 02:19:14.850]  And at the start of COVID, things got weird.
[02:19:15.370 --> 02:19:17.871]  They got very strange as everyone lived through it.
[02:19:18.532 --> 02:19:28.056]  And then when the shots rolled out, it was, it was truly hellish to see the people being harmed from from this substance.
[02:19:29.966 --> 02:19:40.072]  When it first hit me, I got a call to, uh, I called them vaccine lines, Pfizer lines, because they were making these makeshift lines and parking lots and gymnasiums.
[02:19:40.672 --> 02:19:44.274]  They were just, they were just quickly trying to get that shot into everyone's arm.
[02:19:44.374 --> 02:19:46.815]  And, uh, I got a call and I was working an ambulance.
[02:19:46.855 --> 02:19:55.220]  I got a call to a full arrest, someone who had died after receiving their shot and got there, worked, worked the code, tried to revive the patient.
[02:19:55.899 --> 02:20:08.144]  And imagine a bunch of people waiting for their shot, watching this unfold, and then the nurse, one of the nurses giving the shots, walks up and says, this is the second one in two weeks.
[02:20:08.764 --> 02:20:10.505]  The second one that has died in two weeks.
[02:20:10.545 --> 02:20:15.246]  So I know of two that died in that particular vaccine clinic.
[02:20:16.167 --> 02:20:21.489]  Don't know how many actually, you know, as a whole, but I know... So it's like watching people march into gas chambers.
[02:20:23.055 --> 02:20:23.355]  Yes.
[02:20:23.755 --> 02:20:26.416]  It's truly like watching cattle get ready to be slaughtered.
[02:20:26.916 --> 02:20:36.118]  And what's even, I remember at one point while working the patient, I looked over my shoulder and just, it still entrenched in my mind the fact that no one was leaving.
[02:20:36.178 --> 02:20:37.518]  They were just standing there.
[02:20:38.458 --> 02:20:41.719]  It was just out of a bad sci-fi horror movie.
[02:20:43.239 --> 02:20:46.020]  And then after that, I just kept seeing worse and worse.
[02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:47.740]  Young strokes, young heart attacks.
[02:20:48.861 --> 02:20:56.568]  It was just all these red flags were going up because they were saying safe, safe, just constantly blasting the propaganda that this was super safe.
[02:20:57.669 --> 02:21:02.834]  And I worked contracts and I got to one contract where they did a huge Pfizer push.
[02:21:04.295 --> 02:21:10.240]  Like this small community just got all their shots pretty much the same time so we could see the carnage unfold.
[02:21:11.181 --> 02:21:14.744]  A lot of it was it was a lot easier to see whenever they all did at the same time.
[02:21:14.784 --> 02:21:15.665]  It's a small community.
[02:21:16.807 --> 02:21:19.269]  And we had to intubate our nurse manager.
[02:21:19.809 --> 02:21:24.213]  The miscarriages, I mean, in one shift I saw nine miscarriages.
[02:21:24.453 --> 02:21:32.099]  We were so busy, ladies were having to sit outside in the chairs just bleeding until we could get them back.
[02:21:33.039 --> 02:21:37.483]  I asked one PA that was sitting with me, I said, have you ever seen anything like this before?
[02:21:38.303 --> 02:21:43.207]  And the PA, I mean, agreed that no, never seen anything like it.
[02:21:43.815 --> 02:21:47.436]  I told him about my experience in the Pfizer line, in the, you know, Pfizer clinic.
[02:21:48.316 --> 02:21:51.017]  And the PA literally said, I'm putting my head in the sand.
[02:21:51.057 --> 02:21:51.777]  It's just too big.
[02:21:52.477 --> 02:21:55.198]  People, people are so afraid of this system.
[02:21:56.218 --> 02:22:02.719]  It's, it's very sad, the amount of fear that's driving people to not only remain silent, but get this experimentation.
[02:22:03.700 --> 02:22:08.241]  The ER doctor walked up to me after one day and said, we're experiencing genocide.
[02:22:08.801 --> 02:22:09.521]  It was that bad.
[02:22:10.583 --> 02:22:13.004]  We're experiencing genocide, I heard from my ER doctor.
[02:22:13.124 --> 02:22:15.365]  And I went outside and I went to the ambulance bay.
[02:22:15.405 --> 02:22:17.705]  I decided, okay, because I've been typing this whole time.
[02:22:17.745 --> 02:22:22.147]  I've been trying to tell people what I experienced and I just kept getting deleted and censored.
[02:22:22.187 --> 02:22:27.649]  I mean, every time I would make a post on YouTube or TikTok or wherever, it would just go away.
[02:22:27.669 --> 02:22:30.650]  It would last maybe 12, 24 hours and just disappear.
[02:22:31.756 --> 02:22:36.379]  I went out to the ambulance bay and I finally decided I'm going to put my face on camera and I'm going to warn people.
[02:22:36.419 --> 02:22:38.080]  So I said, you know, I'm a paramedic.
[02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:39.461]  I did CPR on a Pfizer line.
[02:22:39.481 --> 02:22:41.602]  The line lost two patients within two weeks.
[02:22:43.163 --> 02:22:49.267]  That video, I mean, it gained over a million views within 12 hours or so, maybe 24.
[02:22:50.728 --> 02:22:53.738]   But that wasn't What got me was the comments.
[02:22:54.618 --> 02:22:55.939]  One comment after another.
[02:22:55.959 --> 02:22:57.240]  I lost my mother.
[02:22:57.320 --> 02:22:58.241]  I lost my brother.
[02:22:58.301 --> 02:22:59.141]  I lost my aunt.
[02:22:59.201 --> 02:23:00.182]  I lost my uncle.
[02:23:00.602 --> 02:23:02.443]  I was getting the people attacking me.
[02:23:02.764 --> 02:23:12.610]  It seemed like these parroting bot accounts, which now I know is probably government entities or Pfizer entities that were there to attack anyone going against their agenda.
[02:23:13.090 --> 02:23:26.319]   But all of that evidence, all of the comments of people that were just holding on to all this pain during this experiment, And I was trying to talk to them, trying to get back to as many as I could, and then the video was deleted.
[02:23:27.860 --> 02:23:29.781]  They said it was for terroristic activity.
[02:23:30.201 --> 02:23:36.824]  So a paramedic trying to warn you about what I've seen, what I'm witnessing, was terroristic activity.
[02:23:38.425 --> 02:23:40.046]  And that scared me.
[02:23:40.206 --> 02:23:42.767]  I'm not gonna lie, it scared me for a moment.
[02:23:43.708 --> 02:23:44.588]  And then it pissed me off.
[02:23:46.209 --> 02:23:52.012]   Because You can't cut the tongue out of your frontline workers.
[02:23:52.092 --> 02:23:52.572]  You can't.
[02:23:53.373 --> 02:23:55.133]  And if you are, that proves intent.
[02:23:55.813 --> 02:23:57.614]  That proves you're trying to hurt people.
[02:23:57.994 --> 02:24:07.838]  If I'm on here trying to help gain consent, to try to give you actual information, and you tell me to shut up and sit down, to stay in my lane.
[02:24:08.879 --> 02:24:11.660]  This is my lane.
[02:24:11.700 --> 02:24:12.720]  This is where I belong.
[02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:15.701]  It's the government entities that are in the wrong lane.
[02:24:16.842 --> 02:24:19.856]   And it's It's very unnerving, Alex.
[02:24:21.738 --> 02:24:23.659]  I know it is, and most people are cowards.
[02:24:24.180 --> 02:24:28.403]  They can't face the horror of this, but talk about your fellow EMTs, what they're seeing.
[02:24:30.504 --> 02:24:31.865]  Oh, they're seeing the same things.
[02:24:32.246 --> 02:24:45.636]  You have some that are bought into the system, just like we see people that are, you know, your typical CNN, MSNBC followers that someone could die right in front of them, and they're never going to ask them if they took the vaccines.
[02:24:46.414 --> 02:24:53.801]  I'm one of the few that actually asks all my patients if they've taken the vaccines, or I ask the parents of my patients if they've taken the vaccines.
[02:24:55.042 --> 02:24:58.405]  But a lot of these, a lot of health care workers don't want to ask.
[02:24:58.445 --> 02:25:03.530]  They're either too afraid to, they don't want to have the awkward conversations, but they know.
[02:25:03.630 --> 02:25:14.532]   I mean, I have, most of my friends either have health issues already, heart problems already from their vaccines, Or just won't get any more for sure.
[02:25:14.552 --> 02:25:19.018]  And I don't receive any, in real life, I don't receive any pushback anymore.
[02:25:19.058 --> 02:25:20.680]  The only pushback I get is online.
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:26.727]  Those shills, those people that come online and try to dox me, out me, get my license taken away.
[02:25:26.747 --> 02:25:31.472]  Well that's the creepiest part is I was there when they were still in the election from Trump.
[02:25:32.333 --> 02:25:44.204]  In 2021 or 2020 still in Phoenix, and I'm sitting out there shooting reports by the Wesson Hotel in downtown Phoenix by the little square they had.
[02:25:45.025 --> 02:25:48.328]  And a bus drives by saying kids are now having strokes and heart attacks.
[02:25:48.368 --> 02:25:48.748]  It's normal.
[02:25:49.389 --> 02:25:53.533]  Another thing says Pfizer can now give you biotech to heal you.
[02:25:53.993 --> 02:26:03.062]  And I'm like, that wasn't happening yet, but I'd read the Pfizer report and the FDA report predicting blood clots and all this that had come out a few months before.
[02:26:03.482 --> 02:26:05.244]  I was like, oh my God, they're pre-programming it.
[02:26:05.564 --> 02:26:08.527]  And now there's TV ads everywhere saying heart attacks are normal in kids.
[02:26:08.607 --> 02:26:12.070]  I mean, it's like they're even running ads to normalize it.
[02:26:12.110 --> 02:26:13.352]  It's like so obvious.
[02:26:14.955 --> 02:26:15.235]  Agreed.
[02:26:16.175 --> 02:26:22.257]  It's false affirmation, just like they're doing with a bunch of things, I mean, in regards to what we're witnessing.
[02:26:22.297 --> 02:26:25.358]  I mean, they're trying to affirm false genders.
[02:26:25.398 --> 02:26:30.240]  They're trying to affirm heart attacks in the young.
[02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:34.321]  We didn't experience things like that before the COVID shot.
[02:26:35.041 --> 02:26:37.042]  I didn't experience things like that during COVID.
[02:26:37.847 --> 02:26:41.668]  During COVID, our children's hospitals were practically empty.
[02:26:41.868 --> 02:26:43.268]  Most of the kids weren't going to school.
[02:26:43.628 --> 02:26:49.050]  Most of our calls for kids are usually trauma or you'll have some respiratory calls or some febrile seizures.
[02:26:49.210 --> 02:26:53.411]  But for the most part, our children's hospitals were empty during COVID.
[02:26:54.311 --> 02:27:02.033]  After the shots rolled out, I started running young strokes, young heart attacks, young heart problems, kids calling with chest pain.
[02:27:02.805 --> 02:27:11.347]  Seizures without being, you know, not febrile seizures, just strange unexplained seizures that, you know, these people have never had before.
[02:27:11.387 --> 02:27:19.689]  I was running to certain schools two to three times a day because of these new onset seizures and I would ask them if they've taken any other shots and it was a consistent yes.
[02:27:19.789 --> 02:27:24.690]  The people that were experiencing these things had had that experimental gene therapy shot.
[02:27:25.850 --> 02:27:29.747]   And when I would go online and try to talk about it, I would just get deleted.
[02:27:29.767 --> 02:27:30.927]  It's sad.
[02:27:30.967 --> 02:27:34.429]  I was trying to talk to someone earlier who's just mad at all health care workers.
[02:27:35.049 --> 02:27:36.470]  And I can understand the anger.
[02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:37.651]  Trust me, I get it.
[02:27:38.331 --> 02:27:40.152]  I've gone through my stages of anger.
[02:27:40.192 --> 02:27:45.254]  But you guys, the Globalist Brag and the Spars document, they plan to blame all health care workers in America.
[02:27:45.314 --> 02:27:47.035]  No, this was compartmentalized.
[02:27:49.537 --> 02:27:49.957]  I agree.
[02:27:50.177 --> 02:27:52.318]  And then anyone who tried to speak was censored.
[02:27:52.913 --> 02:27:54.694]  I mean, why weren't you speaking out earlier?
[02:27:54.894 --> 02:27:56.594]  I've been speaking out for years now.
[02:27:56.694 --> 02:28:00.735]  I'm barely, just now, not getting censored because of Elon Musk.
[02:28:00.775 --> 02:28:05.196]  And thank you, Elon Musk, for giving us a home to talk because... Exactly.
[02:28:05.356 --> 02:28:08.197]  Shame on people that say Musk is bad.
[02:28:08.297 --> 02:28:09.898]  He is directly attacking them.
[02:28:09.918 --> 02:28:10.778]  You can't deny it.
[02:28:11.198 --> 02:28:12.298]  He is devastating them.
[02:28:13.859 --> 02:28:15.079]  Oh, without a doubt.
[02:28:15.099 --> 02:28:20.930]   Without this platform, We would just keep getting kicked over and over again.
[02:28:20.970 --> 02:28:23.894]  Being censored when you're trying to warn people is like getting kicked in the gut.
[02:28:24.314 --> 02:28:28.038]  You're constantly getting kicked, the breath gets knocked out, and a lot of people just stop.
[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:34.626]  The only reason I haven't stopped is because I have faith in God and also if he kicked me I sort of want to kick back.
[02:28:35.287 --> 02:28:37.149]  But I totally, I totally get it.
[02:28:38.044 --> 02:28:41.926]  Why people have just shut up because the system is so big.
[02:28:42.186 --> 02:28:43.387]  It's a Goliath system.
[02:28:43.887 --> 02:28:49.190]  But where Goliath and this system is messed up is it threw a lot of us into a corner.
[02:28:49.690 --> 02:28:52.512]  I've met more people that I would have never met in my life.
[02:28:52.572 --> 02:28:54.753]  Let's come back with exactly.
[02:28:54.773 --> 02:28:56.074]  You have nothing to lose but the truth.
[02:28:56.094 --> 02:28:57.614]  And you're not going to lose the truth.
[02:28:57.654 --> 02:28:57.955]  Stay there.
[02:28:57.995 --> 02:28:59.295]  Let's talk about the Goliath system.
[02:28:59.335 --> 02:28:59.936]  We come right back.
[02:29:00.456 --> 02:29:02.597]  Powerful information with our guest.
[02:29:02.677 --> 02:29:03.137]  Stay with us.
[02:29:03.618 --> 02:29:04.098]  Gary Fisher.
[02:29:07.076 --> 02:29:09.639]  Your cardiovascular system is under attack.
[02:29:10.219 --> 02:29:10.940]  Everybody knows it.
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:18.107]  I've got in my hands two products that are absolutely insane when it comes to what they do for your body and your overall health.

[02:29:22.151 --> 02:29:23.692]  Everybody knows how good fish oil is.
[02:29:23.933 --> 02:29:24.954]  This is as good as it gets.

[02:30:06.673 --> 02:30:09.234]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.

[02:30:12.275 --> 02:30:15.437]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[02:30:15.477 --> 02:30:18.378]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.

[02:31:07.305 --> 02:31:18.477]   If, by Rudyard Kipling, If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you.
[02:31:19.257 --> 02:31:24.560]  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too.
[02:31:25.440 --> 02:31:31.923]  If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about, don't deal in lies.
[02:31:32.383 --> 02:31:38.186]  Or being hated, don't give way to hating, and yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise.
[02:31:39.949 --> 02:32:18.568]   If you can dream and not make dreams your master, if you can think and not make thoughts your aim, if you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two impostors just the same, if you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken, twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, and stoop and build them up with worn-out tools, If you can make one heap of all your winnings, and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss, and lose and start again at your beginnings, and never breathe a word about your loss.
[02:32:19.469 --> 02:32:31.539]  If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after they are gone, and so hold on when there is nothing in you except the will which says to them, hold on.
[02:32:32.921 --> 02:32:38.703]  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings, nor lose the common touch.
[02:32:39.423 --> 02:32:46.125]  If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, if all men count with you, but a nun too much.
[02:32:47.286 --> 02:32:56.008]  If you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run, yours is the earth and everything that's in it.
[02:32:57.028 --> 02:33:02.028]  And, which is more, you'll be a man, my son.
[02:33:02.028 --> 02:33:07.028]  [Music]
[02:33:07.028 --> 02:33:12.028]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order is...
[02:33:12.140 --> 02:33:14.140]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:14.140 --> 02:33:27.140]  [Music]
[02:33:27.140 --> 02:33:32.140]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:33:32.605 --> 02:33:34.086]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:36.087 --> 02:33:42.732]  In Europe, in the UK, in Canada, in the US, they're running TV ads everywhere that heart attacks in children are completely normal.
[02:33:43.092 --> 02:33:44.773]  This is sick, and this is evil.
[02:33:48.195 --> 02:33:50.156]  Hey, guys, back up, okay?
[02:33:50.256 --> 02:33:51.577]  Everybody, please.
[02:33:51.597 --> 02:33:52.538]  Thanks, number one.
[02:33:52.438 --> 02:34:02.438]  [INAUDIBLE]
[02:34:02.438 --> 02:34:05.197]  (sirens blaring)
[02:34:04.688 --> 02:34:24.688]  [Music]
[02:34:24.688 --> 02:34:26.688]  Enjoy the ride.
[02:34:26.688 --> 02:34:28.688]  Okay.
[02:34:28.688 --> 02:34:42.688]  [Music]
[02:34:42.688 --> 02:34:44.688]  Oh, you had a heart problem your whole life.
[02:34:45.642 --> 02:34:46.822]  It just now came.
[02:34:47.143 --> 02:34:48.683]  It's not the shot.
[02:34:48.843 --> 02:34:50.444]  It was always there.
[02:34:52.526 --> 02:34:53.786]  But all the statistics are clear.
[02:34:53.826 --> 02:34:54.987]  It started right when the shot began.
[02:34:56.294 --> 02:34:58.235]  Oh, you were having a heart attack when you were a baby?
[02:34:58.074 --> 02:35:00.074]  Maybe your daddy didn't know.
[02:35:00.074 --> 02:35:02.074]  I don't know.
[02:35:02.074 --> 02:35:04.074]  I look up and I can see.
[02:35:04.074 --> 02:35:06.074]  Covering their tracks.
[02:35:06.074 --> 02:35:07.413]  (whimpering)
[02:35:07.517 --> 02:35:08.638]  They made their move, folks.
[02:35:09.558 --> 02:35:10.858]  They're a depopulation cult.
[02:35:13.499 --> 02:35:15.860]  And now, they think we're too stupid to understand it.
[02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:17.260]  But we're not.
[02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:19.501]  We'll implant this device in his chest.
[02:35:19.621 --> 02:35:22.842]  And if necessary, it can reactivate the heart.
[02:35:24.892 --> 02:35:29.334]  But the medical system that gave you the shot, they're gonna save you.
[02:35:31.275 --> 02:35:32.255]  They know what to do.
[02:35:32.275 --> 02:35:35.797]  They're your savior, just take your shots.
[02:35:36.597 --> 02:35:38.598]  And they'll cut you open and make you better.
[02:35:40.219 --> 02:35:41.659]  Then you can run and play again.
[02:35:42.660 --> 02:35:46.622]  Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, who admit they want to kill people, care about you.
[02:35:48.702 --> 02:35:51.782]  (indistinct chatter)
[02:35:51.782 --> 02:35:54.563]  It's all over the news.
[02:35:54.563 --> 02:35:58.903]  Heart attacks are totally normal in young people.
[02:35:59.356 --> 02:36:00.136]  Take your shots.
[02:36:03.838 --> 02:36:04.899]  But they save him.
[02:36:07.140 --> 02:36:08.260]  They'll keep you alive now.
[02:36:09.661 --> 02:36:12.923]  They're your friends when they don't try to medically suicide you.
[02:36:14.043 --> 02:36:15.104]  Heal the future.
[02:36:15.124 --> 02:36:16.685]  Heal what we did.
[02:36:16.765 --> 02:36:18.046]  Let us take over your body.
[02:36:19.950 --> 02:36:23.772]  EMT Harry Fisher joins us now.
[02:36:23.792 --> 02:36:33.135]  He was talking about the incredible censorship he went through as they admit heart disease in turn exploded in 2021, right when the shots began.
[02:36:33.796 --> 02:36:38.137]  But all the states and all these groups are now filing suit and the world's awakening.
[02:36:38.177 --> 02:36:42.519]  Speak to the censorship and where you think this is going, because the globalists have bit off more than they can chew.
[02:36:45.080 --> 02:36:47.861]  I can't tell you how nerving it is to watch those commercials, Alex.
[02:36:48.041 --> 02:36:50.847]   It really, really Upsets me.
[02:36:53.048 --> 02:36:54.529]  The censorship has been terrible.
[02:36:54.769 --> 02:36:58.731]  It's been a, like I said earlier, a Goliath system that's been trying to throw us into a corner.
[02:36:59.372 --> 02:37:03.374]  Where they messed up is they threw us into a corner with a whole bunch of other people that are willing to speak up.
[02:37:04.294 --> 02:37:05.055]  So we've made friends.
[02:37:05.615 --> 02:37:06.475]  We've made connections.
[02:37:07.456 --> 02:37:14.359]  And I'm praying that our stones of truth will come together and make just one big boulder of truth.
[02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:16.741]  And Goliath's going down.
[02:37:17.441 --> 02:37:19.422]  It makes me so mad to see those commercials.
[02:37:20.925 --> 02:37:23.407]  I've watched the evolution of this science firsthand.
[02:37:23.447 --> 02:37:25.969]  You know how they always like to say, the science evolves.
[02:37:26.830 --> 02:37:31.433]  I've watched it go from it's 100% safe to, well, I mean, it's safe.
[02:37:32.194 --> 02:37:33.715]  Well, nothing's completely safe.
[02:37:34.536 --> 02:37:40.921]  I've seen them actually evolving with their lives while I've been running Young Strokes.
[02:37:40.961 --> 02:37:49.526]   And when I say Young Strokes, a young person playing kick, a young kid playing kickball, And Strokes out playing kickball.
[02:37:49.586 --> 02:37:50.006]  Healthy.
[02:37:50.086 --> 02:37:51.247]  No other medications.
[02:37:52.107 --> 02:37:53.889]  Just got their second Pfizer shot.
[02:37:54.689 --> 02:37:58.232]  I've ran these calls to see them suddenly die.
[02:37:59.593 --> 02:38:03.135]  What they've done is beyond criminal.
[02:38:04.176 --> 02:38:20.387]   And the way that they're advertising for these false profits to make money off of kids experiencing life changes such as heart problems, There's going to be a reckoning.
[02:38:21.728 --> 02:38:36.456]  If we do not have legal action, like Kansas is doing, thankfully, like other people are starting to do, but if we do not have legal action take place and these monsters be brought to justice, then parents are going to step up.
[02:38:36.496 --> 02:38:37.997]  And I don't want to see that happen.
[02:38:38.257 --> 02:38:46.401]  I would rather see legal justice and Nuremberg trials, the bad, actually be brought to justice than street justice.
[02:38:46.441 --> 02:38:55.455]   Because street justice To me, it's impactful, but it's not as impactful as a world stage getting to see the monsters for who they are.
[02:38:55.475 --> 02:39:05.141]   And I'm praying we can all come together and get that done because every single day, every time I go to work, every time I put my My jersey on, like I put it.
[02:39:05.181 --> 02:39:10.665]  I'm constantly playing this football game that feels like we're just getting beat because the other team's just a monster.
[02:39:10.705 --> 02:39:11.325]  Well, exactly.
[02:39:11.406 --> 02:39:13.087]  I have nightmares about Ernest Romero.
[02:39:13.107 --> 02:39:16.109]  He's a local phone company engineer.
[02:39:16.969 --> 02:39:18.691]  And he took it because he wanted to protect people.
[02:39:18.731 --> 02:39:19.251]  His son took it.
[02:39:19.271 --> 02:39:20.252]  He was dead four days later.
[02:39:20.312 --> 02:39:21.032]  The Pfizer shot.
[02:39:21.433 --> 02:39:22.133]  Playing basketball.
[02:39:22.153 --> 02:39:23.074]  His son was totally healthy.
[02:39:24.175 --> 02:39:26.656]  And they literally came to him and offered him money to shut up.
[02:39:27.017 --> 02:39:27.337]  On record.
[02:39:28.703 --> 02:39:30.864]  He told them, F you, I'm not going to help kill other kids.
[02:39:31.504 --> 02:39:33.686]  But imagine being Ernest Ramirez, he lost his son.
[02:39:36.287 --> 02:39:47.512]  Ernest, I mean, the Hartmans, the Martins, the people that I can't name because of people that aren't actually speaking out and patient confidentiality.
[02:39:48.853 --> 02:39:58.458]  Where there's, and it, there is so many people that have been gravely affected by this experimental gene therapy.
[02:40:01.004 --> 02:40:03.385]  Like, the numbers are... We say millions.
[02:40:03.405 --> 02:40:05.006]  I think you said, what, 35 million?
[02:40:05.026 --> 02:40:06.247]  35 million?
[02:40:06.287 --> 02:40:07.527]  Yeah, they're killing us.
[02:40:07.767 --> 02:40:08.888]  It's all big sick tests.
[02:40:10.169 --> 02:40:11.689]  I wouldn't doubt that it's a lot more than that.
[02:40:12.010 --> 02:40:13.711]  The numbers are always a year behind.
[02:40:13.791 --> 02:40:14.771]  Yeah, it's a year old.
[02:40:14.791 --> 02:40:15.471]  35 mil.
[02:40:17.412 --> 02:40:18.753]  I wouldn't doubt that it's a lot more than that.
[02:40:18.773 --> 02:40:20.514]  And Ken Charles thinks it's so funny.
[02:40:20.914 --> 02:40:22.875]  He gets there and says, we gotta get rid of the people.
[02:40:23.355 --> 02:40:25.076]  I say, he needs to pay.
[02:40:27.818 --> 02:40:30.159]  Well, I would love to see that.
[02:40:31.161 --> 02:40:37.223]  That being said, I've still taken patients in that are strokes, and young strokes, and look at the doctors.
[02:40:37.243 --> 02:40:39.144]  Describe what you and other EMTs are seeing.
[02:40:39.524 --> 02:40:42.705]  I'm going to give the number out because they try to attack you and all the rest of it.
[02:40:42.965 --> 02:40:45.206]  We have the numbers, but you're the man on the ground.
[02:40:45.806 --> 02:40:47.206]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[02:40:50.526 --> 02:40:52.287]  For EMT nurses and doctors.
[02:40:52.347 --> 02:40:53.128]  That's it, folks.
[02:40:53.148 --> 02:40:54.209]  Don't call if you're not that.
[02:40:54.809 --> 02:40:55.110]  Please.
[02:40:55.770 --> 02:40:56.691]  Only EMTs.
[02:40:56.751 --> 02:40:57.492]  What are you seeing?
[02:40:57.512 --> 02:40:58.232]  We don't screen these.
[02:40:58.592 --> 02:41:00.514]  No one ever calls in and says they see good stuff.
[02:41:00.534 --> 02:41:01.115]  They see death.
[02:41:02.157 --> 02:41:02.197]  877-789-2539.
[02:41:02.217 --> 02:41:02.557]  877-789-Alex.
[02:41:02.757 --> 02:41:05.518]  We want to hear from folks.
[02:41:05.538 --> 02:41:09.180]  We'll take a little bit of the next hour.
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:10.940]  And then Dr. Martin's coming in.
[02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:12.121]  We're going to tape that for tomorrow.
[02:41:12.421 --> 02:41:18.483]  But we're opening the phones up right now for your quick testimonies.
[02:41:18.503 --> 02:41:18.763]  877-789-2539.
[02:41:18.783 --> 02:41:19.564]  877-789-Alex.
[02:41:19.824 --> 02:41:20.264]  Keep going.
[02:41:20.664 --> 02:41:21.885]  Everything you want to tell the world.
[02:41:22.225 --> 02:41:22.665]  Millions.
[02:41:22.905 --> 02:41:24.145]  10 million watching right now.
[02:41:24.446 --> 02:41:25.386]  What do you want to say to them, brother?
[02:41:27.509 --> 02:41:28.850]  For one, the data.
[02:41:28.890 --> 02:41:33.651]  Whenever people are trying to argue with us about data, where are you getting your data?
[02:41:33.671 --> 02:41:34.392]  What's your source?
[02:41:34.792 --> 02:41:44.276]  Well, my source has been working, working through this and actually eventually getting confirmation from other doctors that I've got to talk to that have been seeing the same thing.
[02:41:44.296 --> 02:41:47.537]  And their own FDA data sheet from October 2000 in Minnesota.
[02:41:47.637 --> 02:41:48.337]  Put it back on screen.
[02:41:50.658 --> 02:41:51.699]  Yeah, all the other sources.
[02:41:52.219 --> 02:41:59.150]   I mean, The numbers are corrupted and whenever I take a patient and I've taken patients in that are young strokes, young heart attacks.
[02:41:59.893 --> 02:42:01.674]  I found out that they've had their vaccine.
[02:42:01.914 --> 02:42:05.595]  I've told the doctors, hey, this is possible vaccine injury.
[02:42:05.935 --> 02:42:10.737]  And I've had doctors either laugh at me, I've had them scoff, I've had them say, can't be.
[02:42:11.557 --> 02:42:23.881]  So I knew early on that the data was going to be completely skewed because if they're not reporting these cases, if they're not believing it's possible, then you're not going to get up-to-date data because they're not keeping track.
[02:42:24.682 --> 02:42:25.762]  And I've seen that firsthand.
[02:42:25.782 --> 02:42:26.802]  And that's what it is.
[02:42:26.862 --> 02:42:28.423]  It's a giant test to see if they can get away with it.
[02:42:30.057 --> 02:42:32.298]  Oh, they've gotten away with it thus far.
[02:42:32.358 --> 02:42:40.599]  I mean, so far as to make these huge commercials to make millions and millions of dollars off of pacemakers, because that's what they were talking about doing to those kids.
[02:42:40.619 --> 02:42:42.780]  We're going to place this little device inside your chest.
[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:44.961]  Now you're going to have a pacemaker for the rest of your life, kid.
[02:42:45.281 --> 02:42:45.681]  Enjoy.
[02:42:45.741 --> 02:42:46.561]  Go to a pool party.
[02:42:47.201 --> 02:42:49.782]  Like, what they're doing is sick.
[02:42:50.282 --> 02:42:52.702]  It's a death cult, and they act like a death cult.
[02:42:52.742 --> 02:42:58.392]   Whenever I'm online trying to just discuss what I've seen, The death cult comes out in droves.
[02:42:59.032 --> 02:43:06.216]  These hordes of drones that'll come out and it's either you're lying, you're not a paramedic, you're not this, you're not that, we hate you.
[02:43:07.117 --> 02:43:19.384]  I can literally say and have literally said the death that has been in my own... I can talk about horrible things that have happened to me personally and the first thing these death cult members will do is come and attack.
[02:43:20.024 --> 02:43:22.786]  I leave their comments up and predominantly just mute them now.
[02:43:22.826 --> 02:43:23.546]  I don't block them.
[02:43:23.606 --> 02:43:25.127]  I want the world to see what they are.
[02:43:25.729 --> 02:43:31.454]  Good people can see what these people are doing and know right away who's bad and who's good.
[02:43:32.154 --> 02:43:33.455]  And I want the world to see that.
[02:43:33.876 --> 02:43:47.647]  I want the world to see that doctor that came on the other day, I won't say his name, but that just completely ridiculed you and me and just obviously doesn't care about anybody but themselves because all they want to do is... Well, you know he's getting paid.
[02:43:49.108 --> 02:43:49.288]  Oh, 100%.
[02:43:49.368 --> 02:43:52.050]  And that's how with Nuremberg too, we're gonna lock their ass up.
[02:43:52.491 --> 02:43:54.993]  Anybody took money to do this, your ass is going to prison.
[02:43:58.118 --> 02:44:01.381]  Prison is certainly the place that they need to be.
[02:44:01.401 --> 02:44:11.589]  I would say if you're a doctor right now, if you're a nurse, if you're a paramedic, EMT, if you're in the medical field right now, you need to speak loud.
[02:44:12.170 --> 02:44:13.611]  Utilize the X platform.
[02:44:14.565 --> 02:44:20.887]  Appreciate that Elon Musk has given us an opportunity to actually speak out and utilize the platform and make your voice heard.
[02:44:21.387 --> 02:44:24.849]  Turn your voices towards this evil system and scream.
[02:44:25.549 --> 02:44:26.409]  Become a lion.
[02:44:27.010 --> 02:44:28.670]  It is the time for lions.
[02:44:29.330 --> 02:44:30.991]  Become one.
[02:44:31.071 --> 02:44:31.591]  We need you.
[02:44:33.312 --> 02:44:34.392]  That's my opinion, Alex.
[02:44:34.432 --> 02:44:36.593]  Brother, what are your fellow medical workers saying?
[02:44:36.653 --> 02:44:40.334]  Are they waking up or what are they saying?
[02:44:40.354 --> 02:44:45.104]   They're saying that it's, they're all Everyone I talk to is aware of what's occurring.
[02:44:45.684 --> 02:44:47.165]  Most of them won't take a video with me.
[02:44:47.185 --> 02:44:52.068]  I was in a room with... Oh, I mean grocery stores and nurses and doctors come over and say, Oh my God, it's true.
[02:44:52.388 --> 02:44:53.228]  We have the numbers too.
[02:44:53.268 --> 02:44:54.129]  It's not like their opinion.
[02:44:54.169 --> 02:44:54.749]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:44:56.070 --> 02:44:56.370]  Oh yeah.
[02:44:56.490 --> 02:45:05.755]  I was in a meeting the other day with nurses, doctors and paramedics, and we were all in this meeting waiting for work or about to go to work and just having a big meeting across the board.
[02:45:06.355 --> 02:45:11.478]  Everyone in the meeting knew the vaccines were bad, knew they were harming people.
[02:45:12.483 --> 02:45:19.448]  But if corporate comes into the room or if they'll just all be very quiet, they won't say anything because they're still scared to lose their jobs.
[02:45:19.588 --> 02:45:25.331]  And I truly understand being afraid to lose your job, but life and death situations are occurring.
[02:45:25.491 --> 02:45:28.934]  So it's time to speak up and they can't fire us all.
[02:45:29.973 --> 02:45:40.165]  Um, that said, I also understand because one of the doctors pulled me aside after that meeting and wanted to talk further and was telling me why they aren't speaking up.
[02:45:40.406 --> 02:45:47.334]  Because I'd asked all of them, they'll go on video with me and make a video, you know, just to talk about what they've witnessed and none of them would make a video.
[02:45:48.341 --> 02:45:57.146]  But one of the doctors pulled me aside and said that they had been giving ivermectin during, you know, the heart of COVID and hydroxychloroquine and doing it under the table.
[02:45:57.186 --> 02:46:00.408]  They were basically giving ivermectin for scabies.
[02:46:00.508 --> 02:46:05.211]  Whenever the person had COVID, they would write it up as for scabies so they wouldn't get in trouble.
[02:46:05.711 --> 02:46:09.913]  And the doctor said I was having to do this and I saved everyone in my community, is what the doctor said.
[02:46:09.953 --> 02:46:11.935]  Everyone in my community lived through COVID.
[02:46:12.495 --> 02:46:13.756]  And he was proud of it.
[02:46:13.856 --> 02:46:16.057]  And I'm glad that, I mean, it's good.
[02:46:16.826 --> 02:46:19.428]  But then he followed it up with, we live in a concentration camp.
[02:46:19.969 --> 02:46:22.711]  It's like being a doctor in a concentration camp.
[02:46:23.232 --> 02:46:30.138]  I have to go by the rules of, you know, our captors in order to try to save my community.
[02:46:30.599 --> 02:46:32.020]  And I said, well, why not speak out?
[02:46:32.040 --> 02:46:37.805]  And he said, well, if I speak out, they'll fire me and they'll bring in someone who doesn't seem to care about the community.
[02:46:38.486 --> 02:46:39.707]  And then my community will die.
[02:46:40.399 --> 02:46:40.539]  Agreed.
[02:46:40.358 --> 02:46:43.958]   Which is a good point, why the military and police shouldn't quit.
[02:46:43.958 --> 02:46:45.458]  That's actually a good argument, be covert.
[02:46:45.458 --> 02:46:49.797]   So people have to choose, God tells them, either speak up for some, others have to be
[02:46:49.797 --> 02:46:50.797]  covert.
[02:46:50.797 --> 02:46:51.797]  Agreed.
[02:46:51.797 --> 02:46:55.197]  I've chose to speak up since the start.
[02:46:55.197 --> 02:46:56.958]  I could have taken a fake vaccine card.
[02:46:56.978 --> 02:46:58.418]  I had it offered to me left and right.
[02:46:58.458 --> 02:47:01.660]  I mean, most of my friends were giving the vaccines at the time when it first started.
[02:47:01.680 --> 02:47:05.561]  They were paying EMTs ungodly amounts of money to give shots.
[02:47:05.621 --> 02:47:16.325]  Paramedics, I would go like, when I went to New York City to work contract, they sent me to ICU and ER and one of my EMT friends, they sent to a gymnasium to give vaccines.
[02:47:17.085 --> 02:47:22.852]   And the EMT was getting paid Four times more than an EMT ever gets paid to give these shots.
[02:47:22.932 --> 02:47:24.774]  But you could be paid to be a hitman, too.
[02:47:24.994 --> 02:47:27.595]  I mean, exactly.
[02:47:27.656 --> 02:47:28.116]  You could.
[02:47:29.497 --> 02:47:30.978]  But they didn't know at the time.
[02:47:30.998 --> 02:47:32.279]  I mean, he didn't know at the time.
[02:47:33.279 --> 02:47:35.061]  Most of my friends didn't know that it was bad.
[02:47:35.101 --> 02:47:36.762]  They were bought into being safe.
[02:47:36.842 --> 02:47:39.964]  I mean, everyone was programmed to be safe and effective, safe and effective.
[02:47:42.122 --> 02:47:54.766]  It wasn't until later, me talking to them, telling them what I'm experiencing over here in this ER setting, them telling me that they're experiencing side effects after the shot, you know, they started correlating it.
[02:47:55.346 --> 02:47:58.007]  It still amazes me how many of them still kept giving the shot.
[02:47:58.167 --> 02:48:00.008]  And I'm sure you saw the New Zealand numbers.
[02:48:00.368 --> 02:48:02.409]  They had one manager, they admitted he was in control of everything.
[02:48:02.769 --> 02:48:07.170]  He could integrate the death certificates with who took the shots, and it was all people taking the shots dying.
[02:48:10.151 --> 02:48:11.152]  Oh, yeah, didn't they arrest him?
[02:48:11.392 --> 02:48:11.652]  They did.
[02:48:13.234 --> 02:48:14.874]  But they admitted he was real, he was that guy.
[02:48:16.215 --> 02:48:20.876]  Oh, our world will definitely persecute anyone trying to tell the truth.
[02:48:20.896 --> 02:48:26.357]  When that guy dies and marches up in front of God, can you imagine?
[02:48:28.077 --> 02:48:28.997]  Oh yeah, 100%.
[02:48:29.158 --> 02:48:31.138]  God's gonna be your good and faithful servant.
[02:48:31.478 --> 02:48:32.578]  And that is my goal.
[02:48:32.698 --> 02:48:34.699]  If I can hear those words, I've done the right thing.
[02:48:34.739 --> 02:48:36.519]  And trust me, I fight my demons daily.
[02:48:36.599 --> 02:48:40.360]  I have demons constantly trying to say, do bad, be of the flesh, be of the world.
[02:48:41.104 --> 02:48:43.225]  And I fight it every single day and I fail.
[02:48:44.066 --> 02:48:46.727]  But I keep getting back up and I hope everyone out there does the same.
[02:48:46.887 --> 02:48:49.369]  You're going to fight the flesh daily.
[02:48:50.289 --> 02:48:57.954]  And the only way to overcome that is to get back up, speak the truth, do the best you can every single day and give it to God.
[02:48:58.574 --> 02:49:00.375]  Because we live in truly biblical times.
[02:49:00.435 --> 02:49:02.056]  What is good is deemed bad.
[02:49:02.116 --> 02:49:03.977]  What is bad is deemed good.
[02:49:04.738 --> 02:49:08.460]  We could say the sky is blue and they'll try to convince you that it's pink.
[02:49:10.223 --> 02:49:11.345]  It's really biblical.
[02:49:11.486 --> 02:49:12.447]  No, I totally agree.
[02:49:12.528 --> 02:49:17.637]  And I just want to say this, Harry Fisher, the best part of my 30 years on air is meeting men and women like you.
[02:49:18.319 --> 02:49:20.102]  Because we get to find out who's real at this point.
[02:49:21.244 --> 02:49:22.745]  And so I want to go to the calls for you.
[02:49:22.805 --> 02:49:24.166]  We'll take a little bit of Maria Z's time.
[02:49:24.886 --> 02:49:26.007]  She'll understand coming up.
[02:49:26.027 --> 02:49:27.848]  So do another 20 minutes with us in the next hour.
[02:49:28.428 --> 02:49:30.529]  And then Dr. Martin's coming over to tape for tomorrow.
[02:49:31.089 --> 02:49:32.390]  But this is so real, folks.
[02:49:32.450 --> 02:49:33.390]  It's all a big test.
[02:49:33.410 --> 02:49:34.231]  What are you going to do now?
[02:49:34.971 --> 02:49:35.591]  We got Jeff.
[02:49:35.611 --> 02:49:36.212]  We got Heather.
[02:49:36.232 --> 02:49:37.472]  We got Cher.
[02:49:37.532 --> 02:49:38.233]  We got Alan.
[02:49:38.253 --> 02:49:38.793]  We got Anthony.
[02:49:38.813 --> 02:49:40.254]  We got D. We got Heavy.
[02:49:41.535 --> 02:49:44.796]  So let's go to Jeff, who's a paramedic COVID vaccine.
[02:49:45.396 --> 02:49:46.217]  Wants to comment on that.
[02:49:46.777 --> 02:49:47.798]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:49:49.078 --> 02:49:49.599]  Hey, Harry.
[02:49:50.703 --> 02:49:53.784]  I truly empathize with your story and your testimony here.
[02:49:54.845 --> 02:50:06.209]  And one point I want to get across here, I've been trying to get into Alex's show when he has Edward Dowd on, talking about the statistical information about the death and disabilities in the workforce.
[02:50:07.029 --> 02:50:09.270]  And it's across the board so bad.
[02:50:09.750 --> 02:50:15.172]  Every major metropolitan fire department is way down in numbers, way down.
[02:50:15.713 --> 02:50:21.087]   And it's not just Standard retirements and not fulfilling, you know, hiring obligations.
[02:50:22.149 --> 02:50:26.333]  People are disabled, sick, and dying for the last three years.
[02:50:27.374 --> 02:50:28.856]  Department numbers are in the tank.
[02:50:29.376 --> 02:50:34.041]  And there's no young generation lining up for the job, partly because we've lost the public trust.
[02:50:35.342 --> 02:50:39.487]  The implications of what we've done, they're going to last for generations.
[02:50:40.731 --> 02:50:42.312]  By the way, the SPARS document said that.
[02:50:42.332 --> 02:50:45.092]  They're going to destroy public trust and destroy the government.
[02:50:45.172 --> 02:50:46.133]  I'm not anti-government.
[02:50:46.233 --> 02:50:47.353]  I don't want globalists running it.
[02:50:47.713 --> 02:50:48.553]  They're really smart.
[02:50:48.994 --> 02:50:50.014]  They know this would come out.
[02:50:50.354 --> 02:50:51.614]  This is to destroy trust.
[02:50:53.515 --> 02:50:54.755]  I agree 100%.
[02:50:54.855 --> 02:50:56.716]  If I could, one more thing.
[02:50:57.196 --> 02:51:04.799]  I moonlight for a particular cardiac device company and we fit people for wearable defibrillators.
[02:51:05.339 --> 02:51:09.320]  It's a garment that has a defibrillator attached to it and gives them the shock when they need it.
[02:51:10.774 --> 02:51:16.095]  I was so busy the last two and a half years doing that on my days off from the station.
[02:51:16.815 --> 02:51:18.296]  I was making money hand over fist.
[02:51:18.516 --> 02:51:20.076]  It's finally starting to taper off.
[02:51:20.656 --> 02:51:23.297]  And once you know it, now the next big pandemic's on the way.
[02:51:23.737 --> 02:51:24.377]  Just in time.
[02:51:24.817 --> 02:51:25.457]  The bird flu.
[02:51:25.597 --> 02:51:30.198]  Well, that's the good news is we got, what, 4% uptake of the new 10th booster.
[02:51:30.538 --> 02:51:31.438]  So people are waking up.
[02:51:31.478 --> 02:51:32.099]  That's good news.
[02:51:34.679 --> 02:51:34.919]  Agreed.
[02:51:35.059 --> 02:51:38.700]  The system is still built there to squash anybody who resists.
[02:51:39.662 --> 02:51:42.204]  Kids are being denied transplants if they don't have the shot.
[02:51:42.644 --> 02:51:46.427]  I mean, the inhumanity of that is just incalculable.
[02:51:46.447 --> 02:51:48.408]  And to look at a doctor in the face and say, really?
[02:51:48.648 --> 02:51:52.551]  You're going to death sentence this kid because he won't take a shot that's been taken off the market?
[02:51:54.792 --> 02:51:56.133]  You just can't make sense of it.
[02:52:00.016 --> 02:52:00.356]  You do.
[02:52:00.556 --> 02:52:02.017]  I appreciate you out there doing it.
[02:52:02.277 --> 02:52:04.239]  I know it's been hard times firsthand.
[02:52:04.259 --> 02:52:05.399]  I know it's been hard times.
[02:52:05.499 --> 02:52:14.133]   So for you to keep going, I know that it's been a A burden to carry and I'll be praying that you can give a lot of that burden to God and lay at His feet.
[02:52:14.173 --> 02:52:15.794]  That's what I've been trying to do.
[02:52:16.034 --> 02:52:16.675]  But thank you.
[02:52:17.315 --> 02:52:18.276]  Also, I agree with you 100%.
[02:52:18.996 --> 02:52:21.839]  We have been so lacking in staff.
[02:52:22.019 --> 02:52:24.361]  We were lacking in staff before the COVID debacle.
[02:52:25.577 --> 02:52:27.698]  After the COVID shots, it just got worse and worse.
[02:52:27.938 --> 02:52:37.099]  I'm currently on a job that I don't have a relief for, and I'm supposed to go home at a certain time, and I keep getting a call saying, hey, we're going to have to hold you, hold you, hold you.
[02:52:37.559 --> 02:52:39.360]  So, that's the system.
[02:52:39.420 --> 02:52:41.420]  They're destroying our infrastructure.
[02:52:41.540 --> 02:52:42.380]  They're collapsing us.
[02:52:42.420 --> 02:52:43.260]  Thank you, Jeff.
[02:52:44.201 --> 02:52:47.921]  Let's go to Heather in Louisiana Cardiac Critical Care Nurse.
[02:52:47.961 --> 02:52:48.361]  Go ahead.
[02:52:48.521 --> 02:52:48.981]  Ten years.
[02:52:49.021 --> 02:52:49.361]  Go ahead.
[02:52:50.482 --> 02:52:51.102]  Hi, Alex.
[02:52:51.222 --> 02:52:51.762]  Hi, Harry.
[02:52:52.543 --> 02:52:55.986]  I want to say first, Harry, I agree with everything that you said.
[02:52:56.006 --> 02:52:56.986]  Nuremberg, too.
[02:52:57.487 --> 02:53:02.831]  The cognitive dissidence that we've seen from our doctors and nurses.
[02:53:03.952 --> 02:53:15.881]  Unfortunately, just like the PSYOP weapon, that's been in extreme propaganda, really affected weak-minded people who we know are being otherwise very intelligent.
[02:53:19.182 --> 02:53:35.595]  I am basically working in cardiac critical care and I'm basically the nurse that is going to take care of the patient once Harry resuscitates them and brings them into the hospital after they have had open heart surgery or been to cath lab if they survive.
[02:53:39.038 --> 02:54:01.815]   Mainly, I just want to say that no matter what your age for any listeners out there, For you or your family members, if you have received even one dose of mRNA, you need to be monitoring your blood pressure, your heart rate, for signs of heart failure, blood clots, arrhythmias, and if you're diabetic, control your diabetes.
[02:54:03.096 --> 02:54:11.822]  Women don't experience, typically, or a lot of times, the symptoms of typical heart attack.
[02:54:12.122 --> 02:54:22.295]   Women, you can have neck pain, mid and upper back pain, Or sometimes people that are diabetic or otherwise might just feel dizzy, weak, or fatigued.
[02:54:22.315 --> 02:54:26.836]  I was about to ask you, what are you witnessing?
[02:54:26.976 --> 02:54:43.659]  Immediately following vaccine, I witnessed a complete surge in young people with myocarditis, cardiac arrest, heart attack, atrial fibrillation, blood clots in their legs, lungs, heart, and brain.
[02:54:45.545 --> 02:54:55.354]  Aortic dissection, and I want to say specifically for the black population, you have genes that make it very hard to control your blood pressure a lot of times.
[02:54:55.514 --> 02:54:57.836]  You may be on four different blood cholesterol medicines.
[02:54:58.416 --> 02:55:13.509]  I've seen many men and women, young 30s and 40s, come in with aortic dissection, which is when the main vessel coming off of your heart actually rips open because of severe uncontrolled high blood pressure.
[02:55:15.257 --> 02:55:18.478]  You're seeing race-specific.
[02:55:19.139 --> 02:55:26.742]  Well, what I think, Alex, is that these things take whatever you're predisposed to in your life.
[02:55:26.882 --> 02:55:27.202]  That's right.
[02:55:27.222 --> 02:55:28.443]  It's a master weapon.
[02:55:28.463 --> 02:55:29.363]  It attacks everybody.
[02:55:30.124 --> 02:55:42.089]  Yes, and I'll also say, in your promo with Judy Mikulich, when she talks about nitric booze, she talks about ischemia that causes problems with the blood vessel linings, the endothelium.
[02:55:42.585 --> 02:55:44.926]  If that happens in your brain, it can cause a stroke.
[02:55:45.066 --> 02:55:49.089]  If it happens in your coronary arteries, it can cause a heart attack.
[02:55:49.229 --> 02:55:51.650]  In your leg, it can cause a blood clot.
[02:55:52.011 --> 02:55:55.233]  And I've seen blood clots from people's waist to their toes.
[02:55:55.833 --> 02:55:57.554]  And I've seen people have amputations.
[02:55:57.674 --> 02:55:59.695]  I'm talking in their 30s, 40s.
[02:56:01.356 --> 02:56:02.597]  And it can happen rapidly.
[02:56:02.617 --> 02:56:04.938]  So, God, just put it on my heart.
[02:56:05.299 --> 02:56:07.500]  I'm just an instrument like Harry.
[02:56:07.520 --> 02:56:10.582]  I've witnessed complete destruction.
[02:56:12.263 --> 02:56:21.326]  Thank you for saying that.
[02:56:21.646 --> 02:56:24.647]  What are the other medical workers around you saying?
[02:56:26.308 --> 02:56:31.149]  The other medical... Are they awake or are they just going along with us?
[02:56:32.390 --> 02:56:36.311]  In the beginning, I'd say maybe 1% were awake.
[02:56:36.831 --> 02:56:39.612]  They were very much just repeating what they heard on CNN.
[02:56:40.393 --> 02:56:46.257]  I see more people that are waking up, more nurses than anything.
[02:56:46.377 --> 02:57:00.688]  I've seen some of my co-workers die and Alex, I've seen since the beginning of this year, we've lost three or four doctors from cardiac arrest or stroke.
[02:57:01.068 --> 02:57:02.369]  Same thing with the airlines.
[02:57:03.090 --> 02:57:03.290]  Yes.
[02:57:05.586 --> 02:57:07.527]  It's becoming harder and harder to deny.
[02:57:07.547 --> 02:57:07.808]  Good God.
[02:57:08.128 --> 02:57:10.129]  But as far as speaking out about it... Well, they hit us.
[02:57:10.149 --> 02:57:11.710]  They promised they would depopulate us.
[02:57:11.790 --> 02:57:12.591]  Bill Gates promised.
[02:57:12.891 --> 02:57:13.992]  I mean, they did it.
[02:57:14.833 --> 02:57:15.393]  Absolutely.
[02:57:15.433 --> 02:57:25.480]  And I went, and I'll also encourage people, nurses, there are so many nurses out there, y'all, like me and like Harry, that have been from the beginning seeing this and raising the alarm and beating the drum.
[02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:27.982]  I went in front of my state legislature.
[02:57:28.002 --> 02:57:29.263]  I spoke to them.
[02:57:29.743 --> 02:57:32.505]  I told them what was going on and I called out my health department.
[02:57:33.220 --> 02:57:40.587]  I helped 100 other nurses along with me file legislation against mandates, and we were successful getting up to the Supreme Court in our state.
[02:57:41.368 --> 02:57:44.071]  Get involved with your state-level legislature.
[02:57:44.551 --> 02:57:48.595]  Well, that's the good news, and it's such an honor to talk to you.
[02:57:48.976 --> 02:57:50.017]  We've got to go to more people.
[02:57:50.037 --> 02:57:51.859]  We'll take about 20 minutes to the next hour.
[02:57:52.179 --> 02:57:52.579]  Stay with us.
[02:57:56.303 --> 02:57:57.804]  What made you decide to start a podcast?
[02:57:57.864 --> 02:57:59.626]  Obviously, everybody and their mother has a podcast.
[02:57:59.706 --> 02:58:01.428]  Yours is genuinely special.
[02:58:01.828 --> 02:58:05.331]  What made you decide, you know what, I'm going to add my name to the hat of podcasting?
[02:58:05.371 --> 02:58:15.860]  Man, covering everything here every day, you get so tossed into the mix that when you get out, when you're on your way home, you just realize you have so much in you to say, so much in you to vent.
[02:58:17.141 --> 02:58:19.363]  And it was like that with the crew as well.
[02:58:19.503 --> 02:58:25.648]  So basically the idea started where I wanted to have the crew, a place where the crew could just come on and say whatever they wanted.
[02:58:25.668 --> 02:58:28.750]  And the conversations just were magical.
[02:58:29.531 --> 02:58:30.132]  They really were.
[02:58:30.152 --> 02:58:39.039]  It was crazy just to see how many articulate people who are well-versed in so many different areas just vent and just come off like an Alex Jones rant.
[02:58:39.099 --> 02:58:40.440]  I'm like, man, there's more to this.
[02:58:41.020 --> 02:58:46.502]   I feel like our fans really, really need a A different way to receive news sometimes.
[02:58:46.722 --> 02:58:47.903]  A different message.
[02:58:47.943 --> 02:58:49.223]  At the same time, I want to have fun.
[02:58:49.483 --> 02:58:55.604]  We have to be able to make fun of all these people who are trying to, you know, infringe on all of our rights.
[02:58:55.724 --> 02:58:56.525]  And it's so easy.
[02:58:56.905 --> 02:58:59.845]  Like, the comedic material is there.
[02:58:59.865 --> 02:59:00.505]  It writes itself.
[02:59:00.886 --> 02:59:06.887]  You sit down in the classic InfoWars podcast room that you retrofitted.
[02:59:06.987 --> 02:59:08.027]  You redid the whole thing.
[02:59:08.387 --> 02:59:11.148]  And it's just nostalgic and new at the same time.
[02:59:11.228 --> 02:59:11.828]  It's awesome.
[02:59:12.188 --> 02:59:19.531]  Dude, and once you get into that, you feel the energy, you feel the nostalgia, you feel just so connected to everything there.
[02:59:20.191 --> 02:59:25.753]  I'm so glad that everybody who's come on so far has loved it and everybody, you know, they can't wait for the episodes to drop.
[02:59:25.833 --> 02:59:29.875]  And I'm truly blessed to be able to be able to do this at all.
[02:59:30.075 --> 02:59:33.076]  And it wouldn't be, I wouldn't be able to do anything if it wasn't for you fans.
[02:59:33.116 --> 02:59:42.381]   If shopping at InfowarsStore.com, getting X3 DNA Force, all the products that we sell, If it wasn't for you guys supporting us, none of this would be able to happen.
[02:59:42.461 --> 02:59:43.121]  None of this would happen.
[02:59:43.141 --> 02:59:44.382]  Chase wouldn't be sitting in this chair.
[02:59:44.422 --> 02:59:50.307]  You know, I wouldn't be going on the battle tank with Owen or, you know, us being able to go to stop the steal.
[02:59:50.327 --> 02:59:55.532]  There's so many things, so many epic things that we've been able to do here at InfoWars, and it's all thanks to you.
[02:59:57.453 --> 03:00:03.292]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones
[03:00:03.292 --> 03:00:31.293]  [Music]
[03:00:31.293 --> 03:00:33.293]  So we're not screening your calls.
[03:00:33.293 --> 03:00:36.293]  [Music]
[03:00:34.466 --> 03:00:39.648]  We're just taking your calls, and you're hearing everything Harry Fisher said at EMT being backed up.
[03:00:41.588 --> 03:00:42.428]  This is reality.
[03:00:42.468 --> 03:00:43.588]  Insurance company numbers are out.
[03:00:44.469 --> 03:00:45.269]  Tens of millions dead.
[03:00:46.309 --> 03:00:48.929]  This is a major test, and it's not going the way the global's thought.
[03:00:48.949 --> 03:00:49.750]  People are really waking up.
[03:00:49.790 --> 03:00:50.770]  They're concerned.
[03:00:50.790 --> 03:00:53.210]  I'll be with us another 20 minutes or so.
[03:00:53.270 --> 03:00:54.691]  Some stations join us in five minutes.
[03:00:54.711 --> 03:00:55.431]  It's a short segment.
[03:00:56.131 --> 03:00:57.471]  Let's take as many calls as possible.
[03:00:57.531 --> 03:01:00.892]  Cher in Texas is a nurse, and what she's seen with COVID...
[03:01:04.227 --> 03:01:04.747]  Hello, Alex.
[03:01:05.208 --> 03:01:07.709]  I just want to say I'm a male-related person.
[03:01:07.749 --> 03:01:09.430]  I don't like to call myself black.
[03:01:10.271 --> 03:01:11.772]  I am an American.
[03:01:11.792 --> 03:01:13.133]  I love you.
[03:01:13.733 --> 03:01:17.015]  I love you, too, Alex, and everybody in this world.
[03:01:17.095 --> 03:01:19.056]  I'm mad at the hue color of your skin.
[03:01:19.076 --> 03:01:26.381]  This is the start of, you know, an appropriation and a beginning of a depopulation agenda.
[03:01:27.165 --> 03:01:38.528]  So, I got hurt as a registered nurse a couple of years ago, but I received several calls from my friends who said, during the pandemic, it wasn't a lot of hospitalizations.
[03:01:39.049 --> 03:01:45.571]  It was a few, but the hospitalizations shot up after the shots or the jabs came into play.
[03:01:46.271 --> 03:01:51.592]  So, they started seeing people with cardiac issues, strokes, aneurysms, blood clots.
[03:01:52.113 --> 03:01:59.316]   I even had family members called, and I did want to put my family members and friends Alex, I did warn him.
[03:01:59.656 --> 03:02:05.178]  We had a family member, they wanted to go on a cruise so bad, took the jab, even though he had already had COVID.
[03:02:05.578 --> 03:02:08.280]  And I told him he had the antibodies, he didn't need it.
[03:02:08.660 --> 03:02:14.742]  Well, he gets a blood clot developing the bottom of his legs, almost the size of a basketball.
[03:02:15.142 --> 03:02:16.923]  So they had to cut his leg off.
[03:02:17.103 --> 03:02:17.243]  Wow.
[03:02:17.343 --> 03:02:23.466]  And we found, our family members found her, one of our family members found her dead lying in the chair.
[03:02:24.059 --> 03:02:34.223]  Another family member, and I don't think nobody's touching on this, Alex, when these people die, they always die flat on their face or flat on their back.
[03:02:34.383 --> 03:02:37.385]  So that's how you know it's definitely attacking the heart.
[03:02:37.885 --> 03:02:40.966]  It's had a family member die, a friend, liver.
[03:02:41.006 --> 03:02:42.847]  It's attacking the liver as well.
[03:02:43.307 --> 03:02:47.309]  But I want to talk about this, Alex, because I've been a registered nurse over 18 years.
[03:02:48.621 --> 03:02:54.765]  And I used to have to tell nurses, who was even older than me, and I was a charge nurse, a nurse preceptor, that's people who train the nurses.
[03:02:55.286 --> 03:02:57.387]  I used to always tell them, go read your laws.
[03:02:57.868 --> 03:03:03.251]  Go read the Board of Nursing Examiner Laws in the state of Texas or whatever state you're from.
[03:03:03.832 --> 03:03:08.215]  Everything you do, you have to do with scientific evidence-based research.
[03:03:08.835 --> 03:03:15.500]  It tells you, nurses, even doctors, but nurses, I'm talking about, what would a competent and prudent nurse do?
[03:03:16.448 --> 03:03:24.130]  So the nurses could even be taking a test for giving these jabs, not knowing we had no evidence, scientific-based research.
[03:03:24.530 --> 03:03:26.750]  What about the vaccine information sheet?
[03:03:27.110 --> 03:03:33.592]  We've given people pneumonia shots, flu vaccines, and we tell them the side effects, correct?
[03:03:34.012 --> 03:03:40.053]  You mean there's nothing, no, no documentation or material for a vaccine information sheet?
[03:03:41.502 --> 03:03:43.263]  That's a question of cause right there.
[03:03:43.563 --> 03:03:46.564]  But I'm going to tell you, and that's why the country... Well, that's right.
[03:03:46.584 --> 03:03:50.766]  We have the famous videos of the pharmacist three years ago opening up the sheet.
[03:03:50.786 --> 03:03:53.708]  There's nothing on it.
[03:03:53.908 --> 03:03:54.708]  Nothing on it.
[03:03:54.728 --> 03:04:00.170]  So how are we practicing something that's evidence-based scientific research?
[03:04:00.451 --> 03:04:03.092]  Dr. Paul Fauci said he's the science, right?
[03:04:03.512 --> 03:04:05.733]  And let me tell you this, Adam, nobody talks about this.
[03:04:07.026 --> 03:04:12.250]  I work with teams of doctors, so we would do rounds because I worked on a cardiac intermediate care unit.
[03:04:12.710 --> 03:04:14.912]  You had several doctors on a team.
[03:04:14.952 --> 03:04:20.896]  You mean to tell me we're only listening to one doctor, Dr. Paul Fauci or Deborah Burke?
[03:04:21.457 --> 03:04:24.879]  See, it's like people thinking we're not the window, Alex.
[03:04:24.979 --> 03:04:26.160]  And it has caused death.
[03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:32.264]  It has caused harm of our own population here in America.
[03:04:32.825 --> 03:04:35.767]  And of course, it was designed to attack my culture, people, too.
[03:04:36.562 --> 03:04:39.444]  And I want to give a shout out to your products.
[03:04:39.524 --> 03:04:41.645]  Went to the doctor, my thyroid was low.
[03:04:42.165 --> 03:04:45.187]  I kept hearing the commercials about your niacinidide.
[03:04:45.227 --> 03:04:47.248]  I took it literally for like a couple of weeks.
[03:04:47.868 --> 03:04:51.470]  Just got my lab results back and my levels are normal.
[03:04:51.830 --> 03:04:54.772]  The brain forage is off the charts.
[03:04:55.292 --> 03:04:55.612]  It helps.
[03:04:55.672 --> 03:04:56.813]  Cher, I want you to know something.

[03:05:01.836 --> 03:05:02.376]  God bless you.
[03:05:02.776 --> 03:05:03.697]  Thank you so much, Cher.
[03:05:03.717 --> 03:05:04.217]  We'll be right back.

[03:06:08.281 --> 03:06:13.281]  [Music]
[03:06:13.281 --> 03:06:21.441]   Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[03:06:21.441 --> 03:06:22.281]  the InfoWar.
[03:06:23.142 --> 03:06:27.125]  Harry Fisher, EMT, exposing the mass deaths, all the statistics, all the studies.
[03:06:27.165 --> 03:06:31.609]  What was it like to hear that last incredible caller from Texas and what she was saying?
[03:06:31.629 --> 03:06:32.569]  That's what you're hearing yourself.
[03:06:35.424 --> 03:06:38.426]  It's amazing to hear people talk that way because it's hard.
[03:06:38.886 --> 03:06:43.109]  We've been going so long not able to hear this kind of talk, this kind of truth.
[03:06:43.249 --> 03:06:49.013]  So being able to actually hear them come out and speak, it's a breath of fresh air.
[03:06:49.033 --> 03:06:50.314]  That's why they want this show shut down.
[03:06:50.394 --> 03:06:52.275]  Conservatively, 10 million listeners a day.
[03:06:52.636 --> 03:06:53.376]  We put the number out.
[03:06:53.416 --> 03:06:54.257]  We don't screen the calls.
[03:06:54.297 --> 03:06:59.100]  They're EMTs, doctors, nurses, all calling in, backing up what you're saying, plus we have the numbers.
[03:06:59.540 --> 03:07:01.041]  That's why they want this show off the air.
[03:07:01.121 --> 03:07:03.563]  It's so big, it makes us know we're not alone.
[03:07:05.419 --> 03:07:08.221]  Oh, I'm sure they're going to be gunning for you left and right, Alex.
[03:07:09.181 --> 03:07:10.222]  I've seen it happen.
[03:07:10.262 --> 03:07:12.703]  I've watched as you've gone through this.
[03:07:13.663 --> 03:07:16.845]  You're certainly in my prayers, and a lot of people out here are actually backing you.
[03:07:17.666 --> 03:07:18.906]  Harry Fisher, it's a pleasure.
[03:07:19.747 --> 03:07:21.828]  So, I enjoy this, because we're fighting evil.
[03:07:22.188 --> 03:07:23.049]  Let's go to another caller.
[03:07:23.469 --> 03:07:26.470]  Dee in Massachusetts, intake pharmacist on Pages with COVID.
[03:07:26.490 --> 03:07:27.531]  Go ahead, Dee, thanks for holding.
[03:07:28.342 --> 03:07:30.023]  I'm actually a pharmacy technician.
[03:07:30.584 --> 03:07:31.044]  Okay, fine.
[03:07:31.064 --> 03:07:32.746]  I just saw intake pharmacist, but go ahead.
[03:07:32.826 --> 03:07:34.387]  Pharmacy technician, go ahead.
[03:07:34.407 --> 03:07:36.029]  We actually make all the drugs.
[03:07:36.169 --> 03:07:37.990]  You name it, I've compounded it.
[03:07:38.050 --> 03:07:42.414]  Chemo, vasodilators, pediatric medicine.
[03:07:42.434 --> 03:07:57.678]   Just long and short of it, I was in New York when the pandemic hit and I saw the fear that the mainstream media pushed on us and I left New York.
[03:07:57.918 --> 03:07:58.839]  I lived in Connecticut.
[03:07:59.319 --> 03:08:09.062]  I worked at the VA, and I saw them take away the monoclonal antibodies that we were giving to veterans, and they switched it to remdesivir, and it's killing every other patient.
[03:08:09.082 --> 03:08:11.103]  Wow.
[03:08:11.443 --> 03:08:12.663]  Then I left the VA.
[03:08:12.723 --> 03:08:21.746]  I stayed with them per diem, and I started working at another big hospital, but I left them because they denied my religious exemption.
[03:08:23.007 --> 03:08:24.447]  I told them, I said, you know what?
[03:08:25.208 --> 03:08:26.228]  Today is my last day.
[03:08:27.791 --> 03:08:31.754]  I'm at another place.
[03:08:32.855 --> 03:08:41.140]  This place, they accepted it, but I've seen the number of vasodilator medications go up.
[03:08:42.061 --> 03:08:44.923]  I've seen our crash cards constantly used.
[03:08:47.505 --> 03:08:49.566]  We have to replenish them whenever they're used.
[03:08:49.806 --> 03:08:50.667]  We're using them.
[03:08:51.347 --> 03:08:52.208]  The numbers have gone up.
[03:08:54.051 --> 03:09:00.577]  We've had the crash team actually respond to, since I started working here, at least five employees.
[03:09:04.220 --> 03:09:05.441]  The ED is always full.
[03:09:07.142 --> 03:09:10.165]  I have two sister-in-laws that are vaccine injured.
[03:09:11.326 --> 03:09:20.293]  One was diagnosed with pericarditis, had to have a couple of random surgeries, and the other one had seizures.
[03:09:23.564 --> 03:09:30.609]  The medications that we're ordering all have to do with people that have heart problems, neural issues.
[03:09:30.629 --> 03:09:33.150]  I have co-workers that have neural issues.
[03:09:33.390 --> 03:09:36.873]  One, her face is permanently, like, stretched to the left.
[03:09:38.274 --> 03:09:45.098]  And it's like I'm working in an M. Night Shyamalan nightmare, quite literally.
[03:09:45.639 --> 03:09:47.240]  Now I understand, so you're watching genocide?
[03:09:48.681 --> 03:09:48.901]  Yes.
[03:09:49.601 --> 03:10:04.491]   Every drug that we've sent out from the pharmacy Potassium, sulfate, TPNs is like IV nutrition, like sodium phosphate, manganese, copper, chromium.
[03:10:05.131 --> 03:10:06.612]  The numbers for that have gone up.
[03:10:06.872 --> 03:10:09.575]  Well, globalists are attacking America.
[03:10:09.635 --> 03:10:10.575]  This is their weapon.
[03:10:10.635 --> 03:10:11.416]  It's a new war.
[03:10:11.836 --> 03:10:12.957]  We have to admit we're in a war.
[03:10:12.977 --> 03:10:13.618]  That's what you're saying.
[03:10:13.658 --> 03:10:14.318]  You're seeing this.
[03:10:14.358 --> 03:10:14.598]  We are.
[03:10:15.459 --> 03:10:15.699]  Yes.
[03:10:16.080 --> 03:10:21.504]  The NICU, the babies, the babies of mothers that are born that have gotten the vaccine.
[03:10:22.361 --> 03:10:25.003]  Like almost every single one has to be on TPN.
[03:10:27.765 --> 03:10:28.865]  And what's TPN?
[03:10:29.146 --> 03:10:29.726]  What's TPN?
[03:10:30.086 --> 03:10:33.809]  It's like IV electrolyte nutrition.
[03:10:35.630 --> 03:10:43.876]  You know, we make, it's like one bag that we, you know, the doctor and the pharmacist, they get together and they figure out, okay, they're doing well this day.
[03:10:43.936 --> 03:10:53.104]   We're going to give them like maybe one meq of chromium per Sure, so you're seeing stuff you've never seen before.
[03:10:53.124 --> 03:10:55.666]  Dee, I don't want to cut you off, but we've got to get to other people.
[03:10:55.766 --> 03:10:58.769]  Anything else you want to add?
[03:10:59.590 --> 03:11:00.551]  Please keep this going.
[03:11:00.611 --> 03:11:13.162]  I'm praying that this channel stays on because we're all going to be needed when the truth really, really does come out and that we need to be there for prayer and also to tell folks the truth.
[03:11:13.766 --> 03:11:14.687]  I'm going to say this now.
[03:11:15.367 --> 03:11:16.748]  I do shows about World War III.
[03:11:16.808 --> 03:11:17.528]  Nobody wants to call in.
[03:11:17.548 --> 03:11:20.590]  They say, we've already been hit by World War III, the bio attack, the shots.
[03:11:20.710 --> 03:11:21.050]  I agree.
[03:11:21.290 --> 03:11:25.452]  I am going to commit 80% of the show now to just talk to medical workers.
[03:11:25.792 --> 03:11:26.713]  They don't want this on air.
[03:11:27.293 --> 03:11:28.734]  They're trying to shut us down the next few months.
[03:11:28.754 --> 03:11:30.595]  They already tried to shut us down desperately the last few weeks.
[03:11:31.235 --> 03:11:31.715]  Pray for us.
[03:11:31.875 --> 03:11:33.696]  God knows what's going to happen, but you're absolutely right.
[03:11:34.056 --> 03:11:38.278]  We are going to have medical workers every day until we're shut down, then after that.
[03:11:38.799 --> 03:11:40.019]  So follow us wherever we are, folks.
[03:11:41.520 --> 03:11:44.966]  I mean, the backups aren't even ready yet, but I'm going to shift to that right now.
[03:11:44.986 --> 03:11:45.868]  I'm so focused right now.
[03:11:45.888 --> 03:11:46.609]  I haven't done that yet.
[03:11:47.110 --> 03:11:47.991]  We're going to stay on air.
[03:11:48.552 --> 03:11:50.976]  And just God bless you, Dee, and thank you so much.
[03:11:51.677 --> 03:11:53.500]  You want to comment on that, Harry Fisher?
[03:11:53.520 --> 03:11:54.261]  And we'll go to the next caller.
[03:11:56.102 --> 03:12:02.950]  For those who don't understand what she's saying, the crash cart, she's saying that people are dying at an extraordinary rate.
[03:12:03.130 --> 03:12:05.412]  They're having to replenish their cart.
[03:12:05.472 --> 03:12:12.320]  The cart that we use, like if I'm working in an ER, or my crash bag, my bag that I take for a call.
[03:12:13.345 --> 03:12:16.389]  We're having to go through a lot of the things we use for cardiac arrest.
[03:12:16.569 --> 03:12:18.792]  Please forgive the chopper in the background.
[03:12:19.212 --> 03:12:26.380]  But we're having to utilize a lot of the medications from epinephrine to, you know, amiodarone, anything we're using in cardiac arrest.
[03:12:26.501 --> 03:12:28.984]  And that's what she was talking about when she says crash cart.
[03:12:29.865 --> 03:12:33.389]  So she's saying, like you're saying, what's the number show off the chart are problems.
[03:12:35.175 --> 03:12:40.580]  It's been to the point where we've had to actually mix our own epi.
[03:12:41.240 --> 03:12:44.563]  During the first waves, we actually ran out of epinephrine.
[03:12:44.583 --> 03:12:46.144]  We were having to mix our own epi.
[03:12:46.905 --> 03:12:47.125]  Wow.
[03:12:47.686 --> 03:12:50.108]  All right, Allen in California, medical insurance worker.
[03:12:50.428 --> 03:12:51.429]  Tell us what you're seeing, Allen.
[03:12:54.772 --> 03:12:55.732]  You got me there good?
[03:12:56.093 --> 03:12:56.533]  I do, Allen.
[03:12:56.553 --> 03:12:56.893]  Go ahead.
[03:12:58.294 --> 03:12:58.575]  Great.
[03:12:59.035 --> 03:13:02.003]   First of all, Alex, And Harry Fisher, God bless you.
[03:13:02.324 --> 03:13:04.184]  Brothers, we're going to keep fighting these people.
[03:13:04.844 --> 03:13:06.765]  And I'm a big supporter.
[03:13:07.105 --> 03:13:10.046]  Just ordered some things from DrJonesNaturals.com.
[03:13:10.086 --> 03:13:10.846]  Thank you.
[03:13:11.166 --> 03:13:12.727]  And Nitric Boost.
[03:13:12.787 --> 03:13:15.107]  I've been ordering that since it came out months ago.
[03:13:15.587 --> 03:13:16.428]  So here's the thing.
[03:13:16.748 --> 03:13:20.089]  I'm going to make this collectible Mustang fast.
[03:13:21.069 --> 03:13:22.630]  But I want to give you the big picture.
[03:13:22.650 --> 03:13:27.391]  Remember, Barack Obama said we're going to fundamentally transform America.
[03:13:28.380 --> 03:13:39.150]  Well, they started when our federal government captured the insurance companies and all the medical industry with the Affordable Care Act for Obamacare.
[03:13:39.170 --> 03:13:40.772]  Which they can then use as a weapon.
[03:13:42.573 --> 03:13:43.434]  Not only a weapon.
[03:13:44.315 --> 03:13:46.177]  Remember, Allison, you're a historian.
[03:13:46.830 --> 03:13:50.052]  You're an amateur historian.
[03:13:50.413 --> 03:13:54.756]  The Kaiser back in Germany about 100 years ago, what did he do?
[03:13:54.936 --> 03:13:58.478]  He captured all the medical industry.
[03:13:59.379 --> 03:14:03.842]  The only thing second to food is medical care.
[03:14:04.482 --> 03:14:13.551]   So I spent 34 years, thank God I made millions, Uh, but I got out of it because, first of all, they came in with the transgender stuff, okay?
[03:14:13.831 --> 03:14:27.877]  Back in 25th, because of Obamacare, back in 2015 and 16, they were already doing the health insurance companies for these crazy people, parents I mean, which would pay for the transgendering of their kids, okay?
[03:14:28.217 --> 03:14:29.698]  So, fast forward.
[03:14:30.787 --> 03:14:36.788]  And by the way, as much as I love Ronald Reagan, in 1986, he's the one that signed off on the vaccine.
[03:14:36.808 --> 03:14:37.508]  No, you're right.
[03:14:37.528 --> 03:14:45.370]  A doctor in Texas had to face 10 years for secret experiments cutting off males' genitals in Texas.
[03:14:45.890 --> 03:14:49.070]  So yeah, this is all a giant, evil, mad scientist cult.
[03:14:49.530 --> 03:14:49.710]  Right.
[03:14:50.171 --> 03:15:01.291]   This is how it connects, though, to what's going on with the quote-unquote vaccines, which are not, is the fact that this is our government They're calling us.
[03:15:01.531 --> 03:15:07.895]  They're getting rid of people through these things, but that gives them the cover of the medical industry.
[03:15:09.182 --> 03:15:16.706]  I was doing group management over thousands of people with all their health care.
[03:15:17.006 --> 03:15:18.907]  But here's the thing people got to realize.
[03:15:19.208 --> 03:15:22.109]  The health insurance companies are not on your side.
[03:15:22.629 --> 03:15:27.732]  They want the more you use, the higher your premiums, the more they make.
[03:15:28.212 --> 03:15:30.314]  They were captured with Obamacare.
[03:15:31.014 --> 03:15:34.276]  And I think Harry Fisher could probably maybe... Great point.
[03:15:34.396 --> 03:15:34.896]  I want to jump.
[03:15:34.916 --> 03:15:35.716]  I got to get to everybody.
[03:15:35.756 --> 03:15:36.617]  Harry, you want to comment on that?
[03:15:39.451 --> 03:15:44.735]  I agree that the medical system has been captured and they're pushing a trans everything agenda.
[03:15:45.616 --> 03:15:47.958]  From trans this, trans that, all the way to trans human.
[03:15:49.078 --> 03:15:50.019]  Sue in New Mexico.
[03:15:50.159 --> 03:15:52.381]  Sue, a nurse on COVID vaccines and patients.
[03:15:52.922 --> 03:15:53.482]  Brain bleed.
[03:15:53.562 --> 03:15:54.403]  Sue, tell us what you're seeing.
[03:15:55.564 --> 03:15:56.144]  Hi Alex.
[03:15:56.464 --> 03:16:05.412]  I'm a bit overwhelmed because I'm trying to condense this into something I can speak to fairly quickly because I've seen so much over the past few years.
[03:16:05.992 --> 03:16:14.976]   I worked through the whole spike in the alleged disease and then just issues that I
[03:16:14.976 --> 03:16:17.295]  saw post-vaccine and whatnot.
[03:16:17.295 --> 03:16:23.295]   And I was at least lucky enough to be in a place where they immediately allowed religious exemptions
[03:16:23.295 --> 03:16:27.536]   and there were a handful of nurses that were on the same page about what was going on that we
[03:16:27.536 --> 03:16:34.255]   could actually kind of like assess summaries of patients coming into our specialty hospital.
[03:16:34.544 --> 03:16:42.929]  And when the story was that it was the epidemic or pandemic of the unvaxxed, we would plant seeds when EMS would bring them in.
[03:16:43.349 --> 03:16:54.416]  You know, because we were like, we specialize in ventilator care, respiratory care, wound care, but we have a menagerie of different types of diagnosis in the little hospital that I worked in.
[03:16:54.436 --> 03:17:02.884]   And what we started to do was that the EMS brought somebody in that You know, the whole talk was, oh, the vaccinated, the vaccinated, you better get vaccinated.
[03:17:03.344 --> 03:17:07.267]  We're like, oh, wow, you know, this patient's on a vent.
[03:17:07.327 --> 03:17:13.292]  And on the summary, they would put their vaccination history and they would put their COVID status, their vaccination status.
[03:17:14.053 --> 03:17:18.957]  And 90% of them were vaccinated and they were on a vent, but nobody was really saying anything.
[03:17:18.997 --> 03:17:21.419]  We're bringing these patients in and I'm like, oh, wow.
[03:17:21.459 --> 03:17:25.862]  You know, I would say this to EMS because they'd give you a bedside report of this patient, blah, blah, blah.
[03:17:25.902 --> 03:17:27.624]  And I would look at the summary and say, oh, wow.
[03:17:28.089 --> 03:17:31.191]  They've been vaccinated twice, and they're on the vent with COVID.
[03:17:31.491 --> 03:17:32.112]  Isn't that funny?
[03:17:32.132 --> 03:17:32.952]  You know what I mean?
[03:17:32.972 --> 03:17:37.355]  So then, that's what I've been bringing to the table.
[03:17:37.375 --> 03:17:41.097]  And they now admit that the shot grows the spike protein.
[03:17:41.117 --> 03:17:41.738]  They admit that.
[03:17:42.678 --> 03:17:46.941]  Well, and like I said, I could go on hours on the things that I've seen.
[03:17:46.981 --> 03:17:53.846]  I saw one guy who had taken no medications in his life, except for, you know, maybe aches and pains and whatnot.
[03:17:54.246 --> 03:17:57.428]  And then he's got full-blown cancer in four weeks after the vaccine.
[03:17:58.024 --> 03:18:05.550]  You know, um, uh, osteomyelitis lays dormant for 25 years and then after the, you know, the vaccine.
[03:18:05.570 --> 03:18:10.154]  Well, Megavid says the reason it's caught in the news, that they kept what's in it secret.
[03:18:10.194 --> 03:18:14.237]  They say it's every pathogen, every weapon, it's everything.
[03:18:16.459 --> 03:18:16.800]  Correct.
[03:18:17.560 --> 03:18:23.745]  And I just want to say, I have to, there was a couple of, of case scenarios that really hit me hard.
[03:18:24.066 --> 03:18:28.871]   Um, I never, I refused to give the vaccine and they were very, They were great at the place that I worked.
[03:18:29.471 --> 03:18:30.351]  I didn't, I never gave it.
[03:18:30.372 --> 03:18:32.052]  I said, I will not give this vaccine.
[03:18:32.072 --> 03:18:33.373]  I think it's murder.
[03:18:34.033 --> 03:18:42.117]  And I said, and I even told my coworkers, I'm like, you give this, when this all comes out, and some of them were kind of clueless, like, well, what do you mean if it comes out?
[03:18:42.137 --> 03:18:51.181]  I'm like, you'll start hearing more about this probably in the next 24 to 36 months, because the pandemic is going to be the strokes, the bleeds, the clots.
[03:18:51.642 --> 03:18:53.883]  We're seeing patients full of clots, their whole body.
[03:18:55.163 --> 03:18:59.371]   We saw numerous You know, brain bleeds, staples in the head.
[03:18:59.732 --> 03:19:01.193]  The nurses are like, what's going on here?
[03:19:01.233 --> 03:19:03.734]  Like, we, you know, I worked at that place for five years.
[03:19:03.794 --> 03:19:06.536]  I'm like, we didn't have this stuff, like, until after all this happened.
[03:19:06.556 --> 03:19:08.037]  Like, we'll put two and two together then.
[03:19:08.377 --> 03:19:08.977]  You know what I mean?
[03:19:08.997 --> 03:19:11.479]  Like, you didn't see this prior to the vaccine.
[03:19:11.498 --> 03:19:17.859]   And now after the vaccine, we're seeing all of these autoimmune diseases, crumbled bones,
[03:19:17.859 --> 03:19:23.298]   you know, cancers, mitral valve, any kind of valve replacement you can think of, you
[03:19:23.298 --> 03:19:26.699]  know, heart attack, stroke, you know, whatnot.
[03:19:26.699 --> 03:19:28.259]  It's all coming, you know, and now...
[03:19:28.259 --> 03:19:29.698]  And the numbers are all clear.
[03:19:29.698 --> 03:19:30.698]  You're an amazing person.
[03:19:30.698 --> 03:19:31.698]  I hate to cut you off.
[03:19:31.698 --> 03:19:32.939]  We've got two more callers.
[03:19:32.939 --> 03:19:38.337]   The Maria Z takes over with Michael Yan with some updates on the war in China and all that.
[03:19:38.337 --> 03:19:39.337]  But thank you, Sue.
[03:19:39.337 --> 03:19:40.337]  We're going to do...
[03:19:40.337 --> 03:19:41.337]  I promise you, folks.
[03:19:41.337 --> 03:19:42.337]   We're going to do half the show, at least, on taking calls from medical workers because
[03:19:42.337 --> 03:19:42.337]  this needs to be on record.
[03:19:42.337 --> 03:19:43.337]  They already tried.
[03:19:43.337 --> 03:19:44.338]  People saw it in the news.
[03:19:44.338 --> 03:19:45.338]  They tried to shut us down.
[03:19:45.338 --> 03:19:46.338]  We survived.
[03:19:46.338 --> 03:19:51.338]   We're going to do half the show, at least, on taking calls from medical workers because
[03:19:51.338 --> 03:19:52.338]  this needs to be on record.
[03:19:52.567 --> 03:19:55.750]  And it's up to viewers and listeners to boost this then and warn others.
[03:19:55.950 --> 03:19:57.251]  We're doing our best job here, folks.
[03:19:57.271 --> 03:20:01.174]  We're going to talk to Catherine, and then we're going to talk to Anna, and that's it.
[03:20:01.434 --> 03:20:02.335]  Catherine, you're on the air.
[03:20:02.355 --> 03:20:02.655]  Go ahead.
[03:20:03.136 --> 03:20:04.277]  From Minnesota.
[03:20:05.878 --> 03:20:06.439]  Hey, Alex.
[03:20:06.479 --> 03:20:07.640]  Thanks for having me on.
[03:20:08.620 --> 03:20:09.801]  I just want to talk a little bit.
[03:20:09.821 --> 03:20:12.644]  You know, I've worked in EMS for six years now.
[03:20:13.434 --> 03:20:19.598]  Um, and the last two years as a paramedic has been the worst I've ever seen in my life.
[03:20:20.339 --> 03:20:30.526]  Um, I've had tons of cardiac arrest, things that is unheard of, uh, pediatric cardiac arrest, which used to be a thing that was unheard of.
[03:20:30.546 --> 03:20:35.189]  And now it's probably once or twice a week we're seeing pediatric cardiac arrest.
[03:20:35.209 --> 03:20:35.909]  That means children.
[03:20:36.169 --> 03:20:40.813]  And babies, you know, infants, uh, children.
[03:20:40.873 --> 03:20:52.346]   I've had, A 10-year-old and a 12-year-old with sudden cardiac problems and the doctors really, if you ask them, can this possibly be something to do with the vaccine, they'll scoff at you.
[03:20:53.186 --> 03:20:55.729]  When nothing else, that's never happened ever before.
[03:20:56.709 --> 03:21:00.052]  I've seen more strokes than I've ever seen in the past two years.
[03:21:01.613 --> 03:21:05.196]  I would say it's probably happening every other shift for me.
[03:21:05.957 --> 03:21:06.918]  And we work 12 and 13-hour shifts.
[03:21:09.359 --> 03:21:30.268]  So, strokes, brain bleeds, cardiac arrest, people who have never been on medication in their whole life, never had any medical problems in their whole life, all of a sudden having heart problems, cancers, autoimmune disorders, and the doctors really will tell you that you're crazy if you mention anything still to this day.
[03:21:30.288 --> 03:21:34.510]  You know, I've worked on co-workers before.
[03:21:34.530 --> 03:21:40.358]   I had a nurse, somebody I knew, who I had to work cardiac arrest on her.
[03:21:40.438 --> 03:21:41.839]  She was young, in her 40s.
[03:21:43.501 --> 03:21:51.389]  I've had family members have heart attacks, strokes, and everybody just will not draw the lines together.
[03:21:52.110 --> 03:21:53.671]  Nobody will say it's due to that.
[03:21:54.932 --> 03:22:00.758]  With everything coming, people will still tell you you're crazy for saying it's anything to do with the COVID shot.
[03:22:01.899 --> 03:22:13.905]   So it's It's crazy, but I'm a paramedic and these are things that, you know, we critically think we're supposed to and they want you to feel alone and like you're crazy for asking these questions.
[03:22:15.126 --> 03:22:17.188]  It could be anything else, but it couldn't be that.
[03:22:17.648 --> 03:22:20.531]  Well, God bless you and call us again, Katherine.
[03:22:20.551 --> 03:22:22.392]  We love you and God loves you.
[03:22:22.472 --> 03:22:23.173]  Thank you so much.
[03:22:23.853 --> 03:22:25.074]  Comments on that, Harry Fisher.
[03:22:25.094 --> 03:22:26.996]  We'll take one final caller from Anna in Tennessee.
[03:22:28.246 --> 03:22:30.787]  Thank you so much for calling in and thank you for what you do.
[03:22:31.087 --> 03:22:36.449]  I know firsthand exactly what you're seeing and it's not easy.
[03:22:37.249 --> 03:22:42.491]  To anybody out there listening, she's experiencing the death that I've been talking about.
[03:22:42.571 --> 03:22:50.637]   She's experiencing those young And they're counting on people to go under the abuse with Stockholm Syndrome instead of fighting it.
[03:22:50.697 --> 03:22:51.357]  They're counting on that.
[03:22:51.176 --> 03:22:55.815]   the vaccines and to see the parents actually register in their eyes whenever you ask the
[03:22:55.815 --> 03:23:00.377]   questions. It's almost like they just then realized they could have possibly harmed their kid.
[03:23:00.377 --> 03:23:05.435]  So I'm praying for you and I hope you can give it to God.
[03:23:05.435 --> 03:23:10.086]   And they're counting on people to go under the abuse with Stockholm Syndrome instead of fighting
[03:23:10.086 --> 03:23:18.626]   it. They're counting on that. We're not gonna lay down. Amen. Anna, last caller and then Maria's
[03:23:18.626 --> 03:23:19.336]  gonna take it.
[03:23:19.418 --> 03:23:22.323]  Go ahead.
[03:23:23.665 --> 03:23:27.511]  I'm sorry, but I don't have much professional medical experience.
[03:23:27.611 --> 03:23:30.536]  I'm an in-home caregiver for an elderly couple.
[03:23:30.636 --> 03:23:35.202]   However, I think What I need to say is a perfect last call.
[03:23:35.282 --> 03:23:41.847]  You and Gary Fisher briefly turned the conversation earlier before you started taking calls, to the goodness of God.
[03:23:41.867 --> 03:23:44.629]  And everything that was said just kind of shook me.
[03:23:44.969 --> 03:23:48.492]  And I just want to say to you, Alex Jones, don't ever give up.
[03:23:48.612 --> 03:23:53.316]  Because I was J&J vaccinated, very regretfully now, in April of 2021.
[03:23:54.837 --> 03:23:58.061]  In June of 2022, I came out pansexual.
[03:23:58.581 --> 03:24:02.926]  I had pink and purple hair after I shaved my head from having a complete mental breakdown.
[03:24:04.808 --> 03:24:11.935]  I mean, I jumped up and down for joy when I saw Biden was our president, and I had completely denounced Christianity in any form.
[03:24:11.955 --> 03:24:17.681]  I was as bad as it could get, and my family is brainwashed, and they are total leftists.
[03:24:18.576 --> 03:24:24.379]  And I'm just thankful I married a man that listens to you and opened my eyes completely.
[03:24:25.219 --> 03:24:27.720]  Man, I started church back in January.
[03:24:27.800 --> 03:24:28.241]  I'm saved.
[03:24:28.321 --> 03:24:28.981]  I'm baptized.
[03:24:29.041 --> 03:24:30.162]  I'm a member of my church.
[03:24:30.342 --> 03:24:31.482]  I watch Info Wars.
[03:24:31.882 --> 03:24:32.903]  My eyes are wide open.
[03:24:33.103 --> 03:24:40.226]  I mean, and whether I feel like you're a leftist watching and just hating or you're red-pilled, it doesn't matter.
[03:24:40.246 --> 03:24:45.969]  I mean, we just like, like Gary said, what's good and bad, what's bad is good.
[03:24:46.249 --> 03:24:46.910]  It's biblical.
[03:24:48.456 --> 03:24:53.508]  My preacher just preached last Sunday about repentance, and I don't think that was a coincidence.
[03:24:54.658 --> 03:24:55.198]  No, it's not.
[03:24:55.218 --> 03:25:00.759]  That's what's beautiful is we're ready for the people that have been under Satan's control to join humanity.
[03:25:00.779 --> 03:25:03.320]  We're gonna win this and nobody looks down on you.
[03:25:03.700 --> 03:25:07.241]  When I didn't, when I wasn't awake, I probably killed 10 of my kids paying for abortions.
[03:25:07.581 --> 03:25:09.441]  And I sat down there and the left goes, why does he admit that?
[03:25:09.461 --> 03:25:10.401]  Because I was wrong.
[03:25:10.901 --> 03:25:14.002]  And the point is God can forgive you and bring you back from this.
[03:25:14.462 --> 03:25:15.182]  And that's where we are.
[03:25:15.282 --> 03:25:16.623]  Anna, thank you as the last caller.
[03:25:16.963 --> 03:25:18.283]  Marie Aziz is about to take over.
[03:25:19.690 --> 03:25:21.790]  But just, this is so epic, they're killing us.
[03:25:21.850 --> 03:25:26.671]  We are in the middle of a satanic overthrow of the earth, and it's so biblical.
[03:25:26.831 --> 03:25:33.572]  In closing, Harry Fisher, people can find you at HarryFisherEMTP on X. Closing comments.
[03:25:33.592 --> 03:25:38.453]  I want to thank you very much for having me on, and thank you for everyone that's called.
[03:25:41.334 --> 03:25:42.834]  Send out a prayer to everyone out there.
[03:25:42.854 --> 03:25:44.014]  Just keep strong.
[03:25:44.654 --> 03:25:45.314]  Give it to God.
[03:25:45.734 --> 03:25:48.555]  Realize that there's a sea of people actually needing our help.
[03:25:49.818 --> 03:25:53.341]  They might not know it, but they're drowning in this ocean.
[03:25:53.381 --> 03:25:57.024]  I see a lot of people out there just drowning.
[03:25:57.245 --> 03:26:00.567]  And you'll look and you'll see some people raising their hands out of the water.
[03:26:01.208 --> 03:26:02.949]  Help those people that are raising their hands.
[03:26:03.050 --> 03:26:04.471]  Some people you can't help.
[03:26:05.632 --> 03:26:08.995]  But look for the hands out there in that sea of people and just help one at a time.
[03:26:10.376 --> 03:26:11.237]  I appreciate y'all.
[03:26:11.257 --> 03:26:11.737]  Thanks for having me.
[03:26:11.757 --> 03:26:12.598]  I appreciate you, brother.
[03:26:12.658 --> 03:26:13.379]  It's so epic.
[03:26:13.679 --> 03:26:14.600]  We're hit by history.
[03:26:16.525 --> 03:26:18.786]  And it's happening now, and we have to admit this.
[03:26:18.846 --> 03:26:20.387]  We have to admit where we are.
[03:26:20.907 --> 03:26:22.187]  We have to admit this is happening.
[03:26:22.528 --> 03:26:23.308]  God bless you, brother.
[03:26:23.408 --> 03:26:25.009]  And I'm sorry to Maria Zeta to take half her time.
[03:26:25.029 --> 03:26:26.829]  She understands that's part of the fourth hour.
[03:26:26.849 --> 03:26:27.590]  This happens sometimes.
[03:26:28.210 --> 03:26:29.290]  People can follow you, brother.
[03:26:29.311 --> 03:26:30.111]  You're under major attack.
[03:26:30.151 --> 03:26:30.931]  We should pray for you.
[03:26:31.291 --> 03:26:33.572]  Harry Fisher, EMTP.
[03:26:34.153 --> 03:26:34.813]  Thank you so much.
[03:26:36.213 --> 03:26:36.474]  Thank you.
[03:26:37.214 --> 03:26:38.835]  All right, we're going to go to break in two minutes.
[03:26:39.495 --> 03:26:40.655]  If I don't do this, we won't be here.
[03:26:41.796 --> 03:26:42.536]  I need your prayers.
[03:26:43.557 --> 03:26:44.237]  I need your support.
[03:26:45.990 --> 03:26:47.311]  I'm not a victim, I'm an overcomer.
[03:26:47.351 --> 03:26:48.853]  The enemy hates me because I love God.
[03:26:48.873 --> 03:26:51.235]  I need your support.
[03:26:52.196 --> 03:26:53.397]  I need you to decide to support us.
[03:26:53.417 --> 03:26:55.859]  I need you to decide to share the articles and videos.
[03:26:56.219 --> 03:27:00.783]  Today I'll write headlines on this great, important show that will save millions of lives if you take action.
[03:27:01.344 --> 03:27:02.625]  Our lives are in your hands.
[03:27:03.365 --> 03:27:04.406]  My life is in your hands.
[03:27:04.787 --> 03:27:05.748]  I am in your hands.
[03:27:05.788 --> 03:27:06.528]  You are in my hands.
[03:27:07.169 --> 03:27:08.090]  We have to admit that.
[03:27:09.372 --> 03:27:12.914]  And just understand that God created this and this is our free will.
[03:27:12.954 --> 03:27:13.934]  We've done this to ourselves.
[03:27:14.435 --> 03:27:15.855]  So please support InfoWars.
[03:27:16.516 --> 03:27:18.657]  Please support Dr. Jones Naturals.
[03:27:19.137 --> 03:27:20.578]  Please get the great products that are there.
[03:27:20.958 --> 03:27:24.780]  Go there and buy some products because it takes money to fight the enemy.
[03:27:25.100 --> 03:27:30.042]  It takes money to have this crew who are willing to stand in the face of this and have to go home and feed their children.
[03:27:30.883 --> 03:27:34.665]  There are good men and women, but if you don't support them, what are we going to do?
[03:27:35.404 --> 03:27:36.725]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:27:36.745 --> 03:27:39.807]  Go to DrJonesNaturals.com for all the great products that are there.
[03:27:39.827 --> 03:27:40.828]  I'm not even going to talk about the products.
[03:27:40.848 --> 03:27:41.609]  They're great products.
[03:27:42.690 --> 03:27:49.675]  The topical wound gel, the immune gargle, the nano silver toothpaste, the next level financial energy.
[03:27:50.776 --> 03:27:51.276]  It's all there.
[03:27:51.837 --> 03:27:53.578]  I can't do this without you.
[03:27:53.978 --> 03:27:54.759]  I need your help.
[03:27:54.839 --> 03:27:56.000]  I'm asking for your help.
[03:27:57.785 --> 03:27:59.407]  And I'm asking for you to take action.
[03:27:59.767 --> 03:28:03.690]  But we're just one focal point, and the enemy is not that powerful.
[03:28:04.250 --> 03:28:12.597]  We can override them with God, but we have to say, Jesus is God, Jesus is our Savior, Jesus is in command, and we're gonna follow Jesus.
[03:28:13.617 --> 03:28:15.559]  Satan almost had me 40 years ago.
[03:28:17.401 --> 03:28:22.286]  God lifted me up as a standard against evil, and that's what God's doing to you right now.
[03:28:22.326 --> 03:28:25.469]  So please support us right now at DrJonesNaturals.com.
[03:28:25.910 --> 03:28:27.411]  Please support us at PolarSword.com.
[03:28:27.772 --> 03:28:33.718]  But whatever you do, take these articles, take these videos, and instead of reaching 10 million today, let's reach 100 million today.
[03:28:34.118 --> 03:28:35.740]  Let's change the world together.
[03:28:36.641 --> 03:28:37.261]  We're going to go to break.
[03:28:37.582 --> 03:28:38.343]  Great job of the crew.
[03:28:38.363 --> 03:28:40.485]  I'm going to tape with Dr. Martin coming up.
[03:28:41.095 --> 03:28:47.261]  That'll be tomorrow, but Maria Z and our special guest from Australia is about to join us on the other side.
[03:28:48.803 --> 03:28:49.804]  There are good men and women.
[03:28:49.824 --> 03:28:50.745]  There are people who love God.
[03:28:50.785 --> 03:28:51.926]  There are people fighting back.
[03:28:52.807 --> 03:28:53.828]  But will you stand with us?
[03:28:53.888 --> 03:28:54.469]  I know you are.
[03:28:54.489 --> 03:28:56.851]  All right, that's it for my segment.
[03:28:57.412 --> 03:28:59.013]  Maria Z takes over right now.
[03:28:59.514 --> 03:29:00.535]  Infowars.com.
[03:29:00.975 --> 03:29:02.056]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:29:06.682 --> 03:29:10.384]  HSBC and JPMorgan Chase.
[03:29:11.044 --> 03:29:13.846]  So you look at what do they do?
[03:29:13.926 --> 03:29:16.347]  What are they the biggest banks in the world of?
[03:29:17.047 --> 03:29:23.570]  Those two are number one and number two largest short sellers of silver on the planet.
[03:29:23.971 --> 03:29:24.691]  Those two banks.
[03:29:25.271 --> 03:29:39.159]  And now we're starting to see a short squeeze happening in silver, but we had 568 million ounces of silver being shorted, naked shorts, meaning they don't own the assets.
[03:29:39.539 --> 03:29:44.562]  They just put these futures contracts on them to shorts to drive the price down.
[03:29:45.002 --> 03:29:56.888]   Well, when you have a short position and the value of the underlying thing that you're shorting goes up, Alex, you lose money hand over fist in multiples.
[03:29:57.209 --> 03:29:59.029]  Not dollar for dollar, but multiples.
[03:29:59.469 --> 03:30:08.693]  The day before Iran basically sent those drones into Israel, China made this announcement.
[03:30:09.313 --> 03:30:12.878]  Said, hey, everybody in China, start buying silver.
[03:30:13.419 --> 03:30:14.720]  Don't just buy gold.
[03:30:15.141 --> 03:30:16.042]  Buy silver.
[03:30:16.303 --> 03:30:21.129]  You made the point that China was trying to call the naked shorts of the Western central banks.
[03:30:21.650 --> 03:30:24.493]  Look at what's happened to silver since that time.
[03:30:25.294 --> 03:30:26.175]  Skyrocketing!
[03:30:26.675 --> 03:30:48.153]  You've got low supply, you've got high demand, you've got a short squeeze starting where the manufacturers of the world, the defense contractors, the aerospace industry, the fuel cell technology people, the solar people, they all need silver and there's not much available because India has already committed to 66% of the world's supply this year.
[03:30:48.193 --> 03:30:50.895]  So here's where we've got this short squeeze happening.
[03:30:51.035 --> 03:30:53.878]  Physical supply coming out of inventory.
[03:30:54.338 --> 03:30:57.560]  Not available for the manufacturers to purchase.
[03:30:58.140 --> 03:31:03.322]  And what has happened to the price of silver in the last two and a half months?
[03:31:04.103 --> 03:31:10.346]  Literally, the last 75 days or so, silver's gone from 22 and a half to almost 32.
[03:31:10.626 --> 03:31:15.068]  It's up like 45% in two and a half months.
[03:31:15.809 --> 03:31:22.332]  And you've got those Western banks that have millions, hundreds of billions of ounces of silver short.
[03:31:23.172 --> 03:31:24.433]  And the price went up 45%.
[03:31:25.234 --> 03:31:27.576]  They are losing money hand over fist.
[03:31:27.957 --> 03:31:42.511]  So part of me says this kind of being on the wrong side of a price move when it's leveraged could cause HSBC and JPMorgan Chase to have a really, really, really big financial problem.
[03:31:43.812 --> 03:31:45.594]  Their CEOs are jumping ship.
[03:31:46.174 --> 03:31:47.375]  They're getting out of Dodge.
[03:31:47.916 --> 03:31:49.177]  Our firm is just different.
[03:31:49.578 --> 03:31:53.561]  We charge 8% when you purchase, 0% when you liquidate.
[03:31:53.901 --> 03:31:59.887]  We buy directly from the depository in Shiner, Texas, the Texas Precious Metals Depository.
[03:32:00.307 --> 03:32:04.792]  So their wholesale prices, you tack on 8%, they ship it directly to you.
[03:32:05.232 --> 03:32:08.195]  When you sell it back, we take nothing.
[03:32:08.895 --> 03:32:09.336]  Zero.
[03:32:09.836 --> 03:32:12.459]  And whatever the depository prices are, you get all of it.
[03:32:12.899 --> 03:32:26.352]  See, that's a huge difference from buying a rare coin, something that has a high commission, high premium, where even after the big move in silver that we've seen, you still haven't even broken even.
[03:32:26.713 --> 03:32:28.654]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[03:32:28.935 --> 03:32:29.435]  Check them out.
[03:32:29.475 --> 03:32:30.056]  Go on the site.
[03:32:30.516 --> 03:32:30.916]  Call him.
[03:32:30.937 --> 03:32:31.797]  Get a consultation.
[03:32:31.897 --> 03:32:32.318]  Email him.
[03:32:32.378 --> 03:32:32.898]  Talk to him.
[03:32:32.918 --> 03:32:33.238]  720-605-3900.
[03:32:33.298 --> 03:32:33.699]  Again, that's 720-605-3900.
[03:32:33.859 --> 03:32:35.720]  One of the most important calls you would make, obviously.
[03:32:36.101 --> 03:32:37.002]  And like he was saying, get silver.
[03:32:36.822 --> 03:32:43.902]   One of the most important calls you would make, obviously, and like he was saying, get
[03:32:43.902 --> 03:32:46.301]  silver up 40% on the year.
[03:32:46.301 --> 03:32:49.022]   He says he'll make such profits in silver when the gold run starts.
[03:32:49.031 --> 03:32:56.695]  You use that profit to buy the gold and you sell it back to Dr. Kirk Elliott with zero cost, which no big broker, no big company does.
[03:32:56.735 --> 03:32:59.716]  That's why there are 4.7 star ratings that nobody else has.

[03:33:07.981 --> 03:33:12.083]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:33:12.402 --> 03:33:14.162]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:14.162 --> 03:33:23.761]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.821 --> 03:33:27.724]  I'm your guest host, Maria Zee of ZeeMedia.com.
[03:33:27.744 --> 03:33:33.528]  What a powerful, powerful segment with Alex and Harry Fisher there and all of the callers.
[03:33:33.548 --> 03:33:38.548]  Thank you all so much for your bravery in speaking out.
[03:33:38.548 --> 03:33:45.467]   And it was almost like witnessing the triage of the new world order, if I can put it that way,
[03:33:45.467 --> 03:33:53.507]   watching the war zone unfolding of all of these people dying or suffering disability as a result of the shots.
[03:33:53.507 --> 03:33:57.628]  But we do actually have other war escalations.
[03:33:57.544 --> 03:34:03.869]  We are already at war, the globalists have waged war on us through these poison injections.
[03:34:04.309 --> 03:34:14.756]  But my guest today, Michael Yon, is here to talk about the escalations towards actual, the traditional sense of war, if you will.
[03:34:14.816 --> 03:34:20.119]  Michael, thank you so much for patiently waiting there and being on with us today.
[03:34:20.159 --> 03:34:20.980]  We appreciate you.
[03:34:23.348 --> 03:34:25.729]  Thanks, and I was watching that with Alex and Harry.
[03:34:25.789 --> 03:34:28.349]  I mean, that was quite a segment.
[03:34:28.789 --> 03:34:37.151]  I wanted to jump to the screen and talk because where I'm at now, I will talk about the more kinetic war in a moment, but where I'm at now is Yokohama, Japan.
[03:34:37.551 --> 03:34:43.913]  And I'm here because I've been out with all the right scientists and doctors and whatnot for, well, many weeks now.
[03:34:44.173 --> 03:34:54.159]   And for instance, Dr. Yasumi Murakami, he's a virologist and immunologist, and he's a Professor of Oncology at Tokyo University.
[03:34:54.859 --> 03:35:02.821]  He's talking about the self-replicating mRNA jabs that are being unfolded in a big way in October here in Japan.
[03:35:02.861 --> 03:35:04.661]  These are self-replicating.
[03:35:05.021 --> 03:35:09.642]  So I'm right next to Yokohama Baseball Stadium, right out my window.
[03:35:09.662 --> 03:35:14.003]  And this is where they jabbed people last Friday, about a hundred.
[03:35:14.543 --> 03:35:19.084]  And they said it was with a COVID jab, but it was about a quarter of those were very young children.
[03:35:19.582 --> 03:35:21.904]  They're jabbing anybody over six months old, right?
[03:35:22.704 --> 03:35:25.887]  They said those were COVID, but they've already... On a football field?
[03:35:25.907 --> 03:35:27.007]  Go ahead.
[03:35:27.047 --> 03:35:29.209]  Did I hear you right, Michael?
[03:35:29.589 --> 03:35:31.370]  It's a baseball stadium, yeah.
[03:35:31.831 --> 03:35:35.934]  And it's the Bay Stars, as they call it, Yokohama Baseball Stadium.
[03:35:36.274 --> 03:35:40.077]  So they only brought in about a hundred, and we were there for the entire time.
[03:35:40.117 --> 03:35:43.179]  We watched it, and they're going to do it again this Friday.
[03:35:43.649 --> 03:35:47.590]  So I'm in Yokohama, which is a very interesting place for every reason.
[03:35:48.270 --> 03:35:53.852]  But one of the reasons we're in Japan right now, it is so important is about the jab.
[03:35:53.892 --> 03:36:02.454]  These self-replicating mRNA jabs are being manufactured by an American company in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan.
[03:36:03.050 --> 03:36:06.692]  And they will be rolled out big time in October.
[03:36:07.152 --> 03:36:10.594]  And these are, I mean, Japan has all the same problems that we have.
[03:36:11.155 --> 03:36:13.456]  They have chicken farms burning down, literally.
[03:36:13.476 --> 03:36:16.878]  They have Chinese buying land next to their military bases.
[03:36:17.218 --> 03:36:23.242]  They have everything that you hear at home is happening here, including migration, quote unquote.
[03:36:23.262 --> 03:36:24.943]  They're being invaded here as well, right?
[03:36:25.363 --> 03:36:25.963]  Same thing.
[03:36:26.304 --> 03:36:27.524]  It's across the board.
[03:36:27.824 --> 03:36:29.886]  Now, a lot of people say Japan would never do that.
[03:36:31.842 --> 03:36:33.183]  I 100% assure you that they're doing it.
[03:36:33.683 --> 03:36:36.384]  And likewise with the jab.
[03:36:36.864 --> 03:36:44.207]  And so, Japanese, like for instance, one man that we talked with last Friday after he came out, that was his eighth jab.
[03:36:44.507 --> 03:36:46.248]  They have the same problems with the vertilium.
[03:36:47.269 --> 03:36:58.133]  We were talking with a Buddhist monk last week and he said that, you know, he's involved with a lot of, we talked with different people that are off the, you know, off the normal specter.
[03:36:58.153 --> 03:37:00.194]  You know, you want to talk with people at funeral homes.
[03:37:01.058 --> 03:37:04.574]  China is buying a bunch of funeral home capacity here in Japan.
[03:37:04.960 --> 03:37:06.401]  Crematoria and that sort of thing.
[03:37:06.601 --> 03:37:07.442]  Yeah, interesting, huh?
[03:37:07.602 --> 03:37:09.444]  Well, they're getting ready, Michael.
[03:37:09.724 --> 03:37:16.290]  The EU has just ordered 40 million doses of injections.
[03:37:16.651 --> 03:37:23.777]  The US is in the process of procuring or I believe already has made a deal for the quote-unquote bird flu.
[03:37:23.817 --> 03:37:31.324]  So they're getting ready for the next round of deaths while they're getting ready to plunge us into kinetic war.
[03:37:33.246 --> 03:37:33.506]  Right.
[03:37:33.906 --> 03:37:35.788]  As you know, a lot of people will fall for it.
[03:37:36.288 --> 03:37:44.994]  And so, a huge amount, especially Japanese, because, you know, even many Westerners will as well, but the Japanese have a disadvantage of language.
[03:37:45.354 --> 03:37:47.515]  Most Japanese don't speak any foreign languages.
[03:37:47.915 --> 03:37:53.179]  And so, it's much easier to sort of hermetically seal this place than information can.
[03:37:53.819 --> 03:38:03.819]   And also, they tend to be more But as you know, Japanese tend to be very well educated, they read a lot, and they're just a very great culture, but they're easy to game.
[03:38:04.219 --> 03:38:05.719]  And that's what the globalists are doing.
[03:38:05.979 --> 03:38:08.080]  By the way, I want to repeat again, I'm in Yokohama.
[03:38:08.360 --> 03:38:16.083]  This is the place famous for Commodore Matthew Perry, which Americans don't even seem to know about him, but he's a super famous guy here in Japan.
[03:38:16.143 --> 03:38:17.983]  He's the man who opened up Japan in 1853 and 54.
[03:38:20.325 --> 03:38:24.726]  And I mean, he came literally with gunboat diplomacy and opened it up.
[03:38:24.846 --> 03:38:26.706]  And this is the place that's famous for that.
[03:38:27.107 --> 03:38:37.269]  Interestingly, I was in an antique bookstore a couple of weeks ago in Tokyo, and I noticed Commodore Perry's first addition to Congress, his report post-mission, 1856.
[03:38:38.129 --> 03:38:39.529]  I bought him.
[03:38:39.689 --> 03:38:40.190]  Unbelievable.
[03:38:40.470 --> 03:38:45.423]   I told a bunch of admirals and And Mike Flynn and everybody and they're like, you got those books right?
[03:38:45.444 --> 03:38:47.105]  And I'm like, they're sitting right beside me.
[03:38:47.505 --> 03:38:53.930]  I mean, what I'm getting to is that was the original globalist, you know, gunboat opened Japan and now I'm sitting here.
[03:38:53.950 --> 03:38:59.234]  I mean, that water is right over here where he came in and the stadium is right here.
[03:38:59.955 --> 03:39:02.357]  So it's interesting how this all comes together.
[03:39:03.385 --> 03:39:08.166]  I want to ask you because we've seen some really, you know, prominent top professors over there speaking out.
[03:39:08.206 --> 03:39:12.127]  We've seen apologies coming out, you know, for the injections.
[03:39:13.007 --> 03:39:15.808]  You know, a lot of protests in Japan as well.
[03:39:15.828 --> 03:39:19.689]  We were at those.
[03:39:19.869 --> 03:39:26.031]  Do you think that the majority is still asleep or is there a genuine sort of uprising against this happening in Japan?
[03:39:26.091 --> 03:39:26.691]  Is it growing?
[03:39:28.531 --> 03:39:30.632]  There is a growing organic uprising.
[03:39:30.772 --> 03:39:31.652]  That's certain.
[03:39:32.336 --> 03:39:36.557]  And however, the majority, I would say, are still asleep.
[03:39:37.478 --> 03:39:43.260]  And I mean, although it's clearly, there's some momentum growing, right?
[03:39:43.360 --> 03:39:45.100]  And there's some inertia, obviously.
[03:39:45.601 --> 03:39:54.303]  And like, for instance, when we were at that jab event last Friday on 14 June, there were people like, you know, trying to slip by.
[03:39:54.363 --> 03:40:08.284]   There was an anti-vax sort of, not protest, they weren't asking for any money or anything, Most of the people at the anti-vaxx protest at the door of the stadium, which again is right here, they were just trying to hand out flyers and most of those people have family members who died.
[03:40:08.344 --> 03:40:10.046]  Like one man, his wife died.
[03:40:10.346 --> 03:40:12.467]  Another man, his brother died.
[03:40:12.728 --> 03:40:19.692]  There was a couple dozen of them and almost all of them had some family member or close friend who died.
[03:40:19.973 --> 03:40:26.037]  And all they were doing, you know how Japanese are, they're very polite, very peaceful, very respectful, but they were trying to hand out these flyers.
[03:40:26.357 --> 03:40:32.319]   And the people that were trying to get the jabs, they were like, They were really afraid of the non-Japs people.
[03:40:32.460 --> 03:40:34.021]  It was, you know, kind of weird.
[03:40:34.061 --> 03:40:35.082]  We got it all on video.
[03:40:36.129 --> 03:40:37.170]  These people are insane.
[03:40:37.870 --> 03:40:45.553]  Michael, I want to pivot into the main reason I asked you to come on today, although everything you're discussing is important.
[03:40:46.434 --> 03:40:59.300]  And it's important to get a temperature check of different countries in the world, because if we think back to what they did during the COVID era, they tested different tactics on different countries to see how far they could push certain places.
[03:40:59.810 --> 03:41:04.072]  So it's important to have that temperature check of different countries to see what are they pushing?
[03:41:04.432 --> 03:41:05.852]  What are they getting away with here?
[03:41:05.932 --> 03:41:11.954]  Scotland right now, they're imprisoning people if they own one chicken and don't tell the government about it.
[03:41:12.274 --> 03:41:13.395]  Six months in prison.
[03:41:13.435 --> 03:41:14.895]  I mean, this is insanity.
[03:41:15.035 --> 03:41:15.656]  Insanity.
[03:41:15.696 --> 03:41:17.376]  They're destroying our food supply.
[03:41:17.776 --> 03:41:24.239]  And usually, Michael, destroying the food supply comes before complete destruction of people.
[03:41:24.319 --> 03:41:29.120]   You tweeted and Mike Adams Retweeted as well.
[03:41:29.181 --> 03:41:31.061]  Credit to Michael Yon for posting this.
[03:41:31.482 --> 03:41:35.764]  Go to page 4 of this PDF from the US Senate Armed Forces Committee team.
[03:41:35.824 --> 03:41:37.624]  I've sent you that link if you can bring it up.
[03:41:38.425 --> 03:41:41.006]  I've also sent you a picture of that section specifically.
[03:41:41.086 --> 03:41:42.126]  Notice the bullet point.
[03:41:42.527 --> 03:41:50.030]  Amends the Military Selective Service Act to require the registration of women for selective service.
[03:41:52.775 --> 03:41:58.700]  Mike Adams has said this means women across America, just like men, will be said to die in a global war with Russia and China.
[03:41:59.520 --> 03:42:01.842]  Talk to us about this, Michael, because this is pretty huge.
[03:42:03.903 --> 03:42:04.464]  Oh, clearly.
[03:42:04.584 --> 03:42:14.331]  And, you know, these invasions that are happening across Europe and the United States and Australia with people from all over the world, this is clearly a replacement population.
[03:42:14.771 --> 03:42:15.311]  It's open.
[03:42:15.351 --> 03:42:16.152]  They don't hide it.
[03:42:16.692 --> 03:42:19.054]  And, of course, they want to kill off the patriots.
[03:42:19.114 --> 03:42:20.555]  A lot of us have been saying this for years.
[03:42:21.275 --> 03:42:22.376]  Alex has been saying it.
[03:42:22.497 --> 03:42:24.719]  I mean, he's got a pretty bright spotlight.
[03:42:24.739 --> 03:42:27.322]  He sees things sometimes decades in advance.
[03:42:27.863 --> 03:42:30.446]  And like, for instance, that this would occur.
[03:42:30.466 --> 03:42:37.414]  I mean, it's actually nothing new on the InfoWars show to people who are paying attention to it, but it's clearly unfolding.
[03:42:37.814 --> 03:42:41.903]   It's clearly, for instance, the war in Ukraine, you know, Many of us.
[03:42:41.963 --> 03:42:55.934]  I was in Lithuania just before that war broke out because I was actually down in Morocco studying the weaponized migration and we saw that the Belarus was pushing aliens into Poland, or trying to in Poland, Poland pushed them back, in Lithuania.
[03:42:56.254 --> 03:43:07.502]  So I flew up from Morocco to Lithuania and since I was with the Lithuanian army in Afghanistan, so I have good contacts, so they gave me access to these migrant camps, migrant invasion camps, for five weeks.
[03:43:08.070 --> 03:43:10.191]  And I questioned a lot of them.
[03:43:10.211 --> 03:43:13.031]  And at that point, I'm like, hey, something's about to happen here, clearly.
[03:43:13.711 --> 03:43:15.112]  And so I started publishing that.
[03:43:15.512 --> 03:43:24.914]  But what I'm getting is, you know, we can see, you know, those of us who saw what was unfolding, more or less, you know, you never know the real specifics.
[03:43:25.474 --> 03:43:27.775]  But we knew that Ukraine would probably be slaughtered.
[03:43:28.135 --> 03:43:29.915]  And now that's clearly occurring.
[03:43:30.275 --> 03:43:36.737]  And we see the rhetoric, not just rhetoric, it's clear that we are getting closer, we're inching closer to nuclear war, right?
[03:43:37.239 --> 03:43:45.085]  Not to mention the other issues that are going on down in, you know, Israel and that region, the Houthis, they hit a ship.
[03:43:45.685 --> 03:43:47.807]  The Houthis hit a ship in the Med.
[03:43:48.027 --> 03:43:52.190]  That's over a thousand miles away with a ballistic missile and hit it.
[03:43:52.610 --> 03:43:56.293]  They hit a ship with a ballistic missile from over a thousand miles away.
[03:43:56.733 --> 03:43:56.953]  Right?
[03:43:56.973 --> 03:44:04.499]  So, I mean, this is really almost no traffic is making through the Suez Canal now, which is obviously increasing the prices in Europe for everything.
[03:44:05.046 --> 03:44:09.408]  And, you know, long story short, you know, down in Panama, it's very similar.
[03:44:09.888 --> 03:44:22.653]  An ambassador to an interesting country said last week or so, he's curious why China is just showering money on Panama and the United States is just absent.
[03:44:23.093 --> 03:44:29.016]  Meanwhile, by the way, in the last week, Panamanians down in Panama, Central America, are lining up for the shots again.
[03:44:29.336 --> 03:44:31.657]  So, I mean, all these things are one, right?
[03:44:31.757 --> 03:44:32.357]  The shots.
[03:44:32.861 --> 03:44:35.623]  The weaponized migration, it's, you know, invasions.
[03:44:35.964 --> 03:44:38.406]  The food supply, the same here in Japan is happening.
[03:44:38.746 --> 03:44:40.728]  Chicken farms are burning here in Japan.
[03:44:41.068 --> 03:44:42.889]  You know, the same stuff is happening.
[03:44:42.909 --> 03:44:45.772]  You know, they're talking about eating crickets here and that sort of thing.
[03:44:45.812 --> 03:44:46.633]  Same thing, right?
[03:44:47.213 --> 03:45:05.025]   And energy issues, you know, trying to Long story short, I've been to a lot of wars, I've studied a lot of wars, and the only two things that I'm sure that I can predict in wars is just two things.
[03:45:05.545 --> 03:45:09.866]  One is wars spread, wars spread, and they spread like fire.
[03:45:10.206 --> 03:45:12.267]  And the next thing is they spread unpredictably.
[03:45:12.547 --> 03:45:17.228]  Those are really the only two things that I can predict about all these wars I've studied or been in.
[03:45:17.568 --> 03:45:20.449]  For instance, you see again the war with Israel now.
[03:45:20.822 --> 03:45:25.862]   uh... you know that war that's unfolding there and it's growing 'cause that's what wars do.
[03:45:25.862 --> 03:45:29.301]   The war in Ukraine, it's growing, that's what wars do, right?
[03:45:29.301 --> 03:45:31.621]  And they're growing unpredictably.
[03:45:31.621 --> 03:45:36.421]   Any idiot can start a war, but it's like a child starting a fire, right?
[03:45:36.421 --> 03:45:39.021]  Now we don't know which way these things are going to go.
[03:45:39.021 --> 03:45:40.021]  Nobody does.
[03:45:40.021 --> 03:45:45.981]   Well, but Michael, again, team, if you've got the link, I sent it through not that long
[03:45:45.981 --> 03:45:49.141]  before the broadcast.
[03:45:49.202 --> 03:45:57.450]  If not, just look up the document called National Defense Authorization Act Fiscal Year 2025 Executive Summary.
[03:45:58.031 --> 03:46:00.393]  Go to page four and you'll see it.
[03:46:01.494 --> 03:46:05.904]   Point three, it's Yeah, I published that as soon as I saw it.
[03:46:05.743 --> 03:46:11.023]   Selective Service Act to require the registration of women for selective service.
[03:46:11.023 --> 03:46:17.543]  So Michael, I mean, what are they preparing for?
[03:46:17.543 --> 03:46:21.942]   Where is America going to get involved next and what do the American people need to understand?
[03:46:21.942 --> 03:46:25.823]  Yeah, I published that as soon as I saw it.
[03:46:25.823 --> 03:46:31.023]   Well, clearly if they start to draft people and you don't show up for the draft, then
[03:46:31.023 --> 03:46:32.903]  that's going to put you in legal peril.
[03:46:32.903 --> 03:46:38.142]   I mean, you know, for starters, they can start to put you in a different class of people.
[03:46:38.122 --> 03:46:41.043]  Next thing you know, you're a felon and you can't vote.
[03:46:41.103 --> 03:46:41.643]  That sort of thing.
[03:46:41.663 --> 03:46:44.824]  There's all kinds of chess moves that you can play with this, right?
[03:46:45.425 --> 03:46:46.665]  And here we go.
[03:46:46.805 --> 03:46:48.966]  I mean, it's clear that these wars are going to spread.
[03:46:49.426 --> 03:46:51.346]  It's clear that we're going to see global famines.
[03:46:51.426 --> 03:46:56.988]  I've been warning constantly since about January 2020 of global famines, right?
[03:46:57.428 --> 03:47:02.690]  A long flash to bang, but I continue to see these conditions being set for that.
[03:47:03.080 --> 03:47:08.864]  For instance, cutting off Nord Stream, cutting off Groningen Gas Field up in Netherlands, which I warned about.
[03:47:08.884 --> 03:47:10.825]  I warned about both of those in advance.
[03:47:11.205 --> 03:47:17.209]  I was in Germany at BASF plant twice, warning that I thought that they were going to shut Nord Stream.
[03:47:17.309 --> 03:47:19.911]  And then, magically, it got blown up.
[03:47:20.331 --> 03:47:24.814]  And so, which either happened by the United States or space aliens, right?
[03:47:25.174 --> 03:47:26.995]  So, I mean, it's quite clear who did it.
[03:47:27.095 --> 03:47:29.417]  We threatened we were going to do it, and now it's done.
[03:47:29.807 --> 03:47:39.210]  You know, interesting, Prime Minister Abe, our former Prime Minister who was assassinated, he was actually good friends with the scientist I've been spending a lot of time with, Yasufumi Murakami.
[03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:48.893]  And Dr. Murakami told me that Abe, before he was assassinated, was starting to push back on the Japs, right?
[03:47:49.153 --> 03:47:57.215]  And another thing is he was interested, Abe was interested in building the pipeline from Russia to Japan, natural gas, right?
[03:47:57.848 --> 03:48:00.010]  And, you know, and then he was assassinated.
[03:48:00.650 --> 03:48:05.074]  But the natural gas pipeline, there's a lot of people that don't want that to come to Japan.
[03:48:05.434 --> 03:48:11.619]  There's a lot of people that obviously don't want Russia and and Germany ever to be empowered together.
[03:48:11.659 --> 03:48:14.222]  And that Nord Stream was one of those issues.
[03:48:14.482 --> 03:48:17.324]  Interestingly, I just spent a month also in Taiwan.
[03:48:18.005 --> 03:48:21.107]  And for instance, I mean, it's quite interesting.
[03:48:21.147 --> 03:48:23.249]  I was meeting with all the right people like normal.
[03:48:23.629 --> 03:48:27.815]   And the day I left is when the Chinese Navy surrounded it, right?
[03:48:28.315 --> 03:48:29.955]  And China's threatening.
[03:48:30.056 --> 03:48:31.016]  I mean, they're going for it.
[03:48:31.796 --> 03:48:33.917]  At some point, they're going to go for it, right?
[03:48:34.437 --> 03:48:56.164]   What's fascinating, Michael, if I could just pause you there, in terms of Shinzo Abe, I just had a really quick look while you were talking, because when I was studying the Boston Global Forum and the AI World Society, which, by the way, the second that you mentioned that topic on X, Filled with porn bots, filled with all sorts of bots.
[03:48:56.584 --> 03:49:05.632]  That is the number one topic the globalists do not want you to share, in my experience, on X. No, no, no.
[03:49:06.112 --> 03:49:11.076]  About the AI World Society, specifically the UN's AI World Society.
[03:49:11.136 --> 03:49:18.221]   This is a book that the Boston Global Forum have written where it says Human beings are no longer considered humans.
[03:49:19.421 --> 03:49:21.702]  You are now defined as objects.
[03:49:21.762 --> 03:49:29.325]  We've entered you into a new social contract, whether you like it or not, and you have no more human rights, and you're now all AI world citizens.
[03:49:29.525 --> 03:49:38.508]  I'm telling you, the most censored topic on X. And so Shinzo Abe, when I was studying this, he was part of it initially.
[03:49:39.904 --> 03:49:45.368]  And it looked like his vision for it was not what they turned it into.
[03:49:45.388 --> 03:49:50.713]  And I thought, there has to be a bigger reason this guy was assassinated.
[03:49:50.773 --> 03:50:05.744]   It's not just the shots, it's the fact that he realised this AI world society is literally the nightmare where you can't leave your zone, you have to get perpetual injections, you transfer your existence into the metaverse. This is what this AI
[03:50:05.744 --> 03:50:12.333]   world society is. It's living out your existence in the metaverse. I was surprised to see
[03:50:12.333 --> 03:50:19.324]   his name on there, but that must be why, Michael. They take out those who are resisting
[03:50:19.324 --> 03:50:23.324]   the biggest part of the agenda, which is the climate narrative.
[03:50:23.329 --> 03:50:24.609]  This is what I keep warning about.
[03:50:25.070 --> 03:50:37.935]  Any world leader that's apparently fighting the new world order, but is talking about climate change, just like all of these right-wing leaders, you know, so-called right-wing leaders in Europe, all talking about how they're going to get to net zero.
[03:50:37.955 --> 03:50:41.817]  I am very, very concerned about these people, Michael.
[03:50:42.077 --> 03:50:45.338]  They are setting us up for enslavement through the climate change narrative.
[03:50:47.074 --> 03:50:47.694]  Oh, clearly.
[03:50:47.775 --> 03:50:50.396]  I was in a museum yesterday, a JICA museum.
[03:50:50.456 --> 03:50:53.758]  JICA is a sort of Japanese USAID, right?
[03:50:54.239 --> 03:50:56.600]  And I go to museums all over the world, dozens of countries.
[03:50:57.021 --> 03:50:59.462]  And the reason I do that is because of information warfare.
[03:51:00.163 --> 03:51:01.423]  I call it museum warfare.
[03:51:01.864 --> 03:51:04.886]  And in this museum, it's a JICA immigration museum.
[03:51:05.486 --> 03:51:07.507]  And it's actually five minutes from me now.
[03:51:08.008 --> 03:51:12.191]  And it's all about, there's a whole big section in there about SDGs, right?
[03:51:12.231 --> 03:51:15.813]  These sustainable development goals and all this nonsense.
[03:51:16.195 --> 03:51:17.176]  Which you see everywhere.
[03:51:17.276 --> 03:51:25.742]  Which, interesting, one of my partners that I researched the border with in Texas just sent me some of that SDG stuff this morning while I was on hold from Texas.
[03:51:26.062 --> 03:51:27.503]  I mean, I see this everywhere.
[03:51:27.523 --> 03:51:30.725]  Whether it's Panama or Netherlands, they use this.
[03:51:31.706 --> 03:51:34.868]  I'm telling you, the highest form of warfare is information war.
[03:51:35.248 --> 03:51:37.890]  I mean, that's why Alex has InfoWars, right?
[03:51:38.170 --> 03:51:40.572]  I mean, that is by far the highest form of warfare.
[03:51:40.932 --> 03:51:54.147]   Kinetics are after the information war either fails or it Or information war was to set the table for a successful kinetic war or some other form of warfare to get what you want, right?
[03:51:54.887 --> 03:51:55.907]  And so that's what's happened.
[03:51:55.927 --> 03:51:57.087]  That's why we have no borders.
[03:51:57.447 --> 03:52:01.748]  That's why so many people lined up to get the jab and went nutso when people didn't get it.
[03:52:02.149 --> 03:52:07.670]  And there'll be other, you know, as this comes along, the next deadly thing, you know, interestingly, the 1976 swine flu.
[03:52:09.453 --> 03:52:15.054]   outbreak, not outbreak, but fake. It was a fake pandemic, right? And they inject, what,
[03:52:15.054 --> 03:52:21.052]   46 or 48 million people with this. I tried to find a book on that, you know, because
[03:52:21.052 --> 03:52:26.373]   I've read stacks and stacks, more than 60 books I've read on pandemic. And most of those
[03:52:26.373 --> 03:52:30.933]   were before this because I'm a war correspondent and I've always been a science geek. And so
[03:52:30.933 --> 03:52:34.653]   I'd read, so when we went into this, I was already kind of dialed into it.
[03:52:35.011 --> 03:52:43.132]   But what I was getting to is I had heard about the swine flu in 1976, but then when I tried to find a book for it, And I couldn't find one.
[03:52:43.352 --> 03:52:46.414]  One is out now, but I couldn't find one.
[03:52:46.874 --> 03:52:52.017]  And when I asked on Patreon about it, they threatened to lock me off Patreon.
[03:52:52.037 --> 03:52:54.679]  And that was when I moved over to locals, right?
[03:52:54.979 --> 03:52:58.281]  So, I mean, what I'm getting to, just asking, just an interrogative.
[03:52:58.621 --> 03:52:59.822]  I didn't say anything.
[03:52:59.882 --> 03:53:04.625]  I was just like, hey, I'm looking for a book on this, maybe an unpublished manuscript or something.
[03:53:05.104 --> 03:53:09.664]   And you see 60 Minutes actually back when they were doing their job in the 70s when
[03:53:09.664 --> 03:53:15.424]   they, you know, the swine flu supposed outbreak, which never happened at all, period.
[03:53:15.424 --> 03:53:17.744]  It just didn't happen.
[03:53:17.744 --> 03:53:21.783]   And tens of millions of Americans were hit with this jab and people were really hurt
[03:53:21.783 --> 03:53:24.104]  by it and are still damaged by it.
[03:53:24.104 --> 03:53:25.104]  Right.
[03:53:25.104 --> 03:53:28.704]   And 60 Minutes actually got the CEO of one of the pharma companies.
[03:53:28.704 --> 03:53:29.704]  You can find this.
[03:53:29.704 --> 03:53:33.024]   They try to hide it, but people keep republishing that interview.
[03:53:33.024 --> 03:53:35.823]  And you know, the 60 minutes just caught him straight up.
[03:53:35.823 --> 03:53:37.543]  It was just a total scam.
[03:53:37.774 --> 03:53:38.855]  I found this other book from 1889.
[03:53:39.675 --> 03:53:40.936]  I read a lot of old books.
[03:53:41.336 --> 03:53:43.598]  Michael, we've got about four minutes left.
[03:53:43.698 --> 03:53:53.725]  Sorry, I really want to ask you about where this is heading in the short time that we have left because what I'm seeing is we have a huge amount of people that are waking up.
[03:53:53.825 --> 03:53:58.694]   We have these These, you know, leaders that are coming in and saying they're
[03:53:58.694 --> 03:54:03.725]   for the people, but behind the scenes they're absolutely 100% on board with the
[03:54:03.725 --> 03:54:04.904]  climate agenda.
[03:54:04.904 --> 03:54:07.365]  Javier Mele is a perfect example of this.
[03:54:07.365 --> 03:54:13.965]   He ran his campaign, he ran his presidential campaign on the fact that he was, he said
[03:54:13.965 --> 03:54:18.185]   climate change was a scam, he was going to exit Argentina out of the Paris Agreement.
[03:54:18.166 --> 03:54:27.311]  On day one, during his inauguration, he sent a delegate to the climate conference in Dubai to say no, Argentina's fully on board with the climate agenda.
[03:54:28.071 --> 03:54:35.274]  And so this is what we've got these leaders that are telling us what we want to hear right now and betraying us in the next moment.
[03:54:35.595 --> 03:54:39.256]  While he was being inaugurated, he betrayed his country.
[03:54:39.656 --> 03:54:41.857]  And so we need to be very, very careful.
[03:54:42.158 --> 03:54:47.680]  These people are leading us down a garden path, but at the same time we have this escalation towards war.
[03:54:47.720 --> 03:54:57.883]   What I'm seeing is if they can't Get control of the people through these fake leaders that they're potentially installing, then they're going to move to kinetic war.
[03:54:57.923 --> 03:55:06.305]  So in the next three minutes, just tell us over the next few months before the presidential election in the United States, what do you see is going to occur?
[03:55:07.745 --> 03:55:09.886]  Yeah, that guy was very to me.
[03:55:09.926 --> 03:55:10.966]  I never supported him.
[03:55:11.646 --> 03:55:12.646]  Something was wrong.
[03:55:13.306 --> 03:55:15.847]  We're clearly the table set for kinetic war.
[03:55:16.243 --> 03:55:22.649]  The table is set for, you know, the lights going out in America, that sort of thing, and your bank's not working, and that sort of thing.
[03:55:22.709 --> 03:55:29.595]  We've all seen this, and I've been warning about it for years, as have others, and it's really down to the line at this point.
[03:55:30.055 --> 03:55:36.821]  And especially now that you've got tens of millions of people in our various countries that will absolutely go planet of the apes on people.
[03:55:37.241 --> 03:55:38.442]  In an instant, right?
[03:55:39.323 --> 03:55:42.346]  I mean, I spent most of my life in these other countries.
[03:55:43.416 --> 03:55:49.458]  And not in nice countries like Japan, you know, I'm running around places like Afghanistan for two years, that sort of thing.
[03:55:50.278 --> 03:55:52.459]  And I realize what's coming at us.
[03:55:52.899 --> 03:56:00.982]  It's very serious warfare on such an epic scale that has never occurred in human history.
[03:56:01.302 --> 03:56:02.262]  Not at this level.
[03:56:02.542 --> 03:56:11.185]  Not at this comprehensive pharma plus food plus kinetic plus information war on a level that's just never been done before.
[03:56:11.841 --> 03:56:14.802]  And other forms of warfare, climate warfare.
[03:56:16.842 --> 03:56:19.963]  You see the water cut off to the potato farmers.
[03:56:20.843 --> 03:56:24.543]  Long story short, be prepared and this is permanent.
[03:56:24.583 --> 03:56:28.964]  This is not like you just put your head down and the riots are over in a couple of weeks.
[03:56:29.344 --> 03:56:31.145]  We're looking at permanent changes.
[03:56:31.465 --> 03:56:36.406]  We're looking at a definite reduction of global population, right?
[03:56:36.666 --> 03:56:42.757]   Various means, either directly death For instance, here in Japan, people are dying all the time.
[03:56:43.117 --> 03:56:46.479]  I mean, we were in a hotel recently and the guy collapsed in the lobby, right?
[03:56:47.559 --> 03:56:55.423]  And this Buddhist monk said recently, about 10 days ago or so, he said he's involved in so many funerals now.
[03:56:55.823 --> 03:56:59.045]  And interestingly, he said a lot of people are dying in the bathroom.
[03:56:59.165 --> 03:57:02.186]  I don't know, that's just a random thing out there that he mentioned.
[03:57:02.667 --> 03:57:07.229]  And because it was maybe on his mind, but it was just, you know, just a random thing.
[03:57:07.848 --> 03:57:13.633]  But the bottom line is, clearly this is all being set up to remake the entire globe.
[03:57:14.193 --> 03:57:16.335]  And if we don't stand up to it, it's over.
[03:57:16.615 --> 03:57:17.376]  It's game over.
[03:57:17.396 --> 03:57:18.977]  It's not like you're just going to... Absolutely agree with me, Michael.
[03:57:19.017 --> 03:57:19.918]  We are out of time today.
[03:57:19.958 --> 03:57:21.499]  Let me say one more thing.
[03:57:21.519 --> 03:57:22.640]  We're out of time, Michael.
[03:57:22.680 --> 03:57:23.040]  Sorry.
[03:57:23.661 --> 03:57:25.262]  We will definitely get you back on.
[03:57:25.302 --> 03:57:32.388]  You can follow Michael Yohn at Michael underscore Yohn on X. Make sure that you share his tweets.
[03:57:32.428 --> 03:57:33.949]  He's got his finger on the pulse.
[03:57:34.309 --> 03:57:35.510]  He's ear to the ground.
[03:57:35.890 --> 03:57:43.353]  Basically, feminists, if you don't want to die in war, to be drafted for war, it's time to stop voting Democrat.
[03:57:43.393 --> 03:57:46.095]  That's what I'm going to say in that last moment.
[03:57:46.215 --> 03:57:48.296]  And probably stop being a feminist as well.
[03:57:48.316 --> 03:57:48.696]  It sucks.
[03:57:49.096 --> 03:57:50.257]  Michael, thank you so much.
[03:57:50.737 --> 03:57:53.738]  You can follow me at Z underscore media.
[03:57:54.098 --> 03:57:55.099]  I'll see you next time.
[03:57:56.192 --> 03:58:19.671]  What do you make of the attempt to take January 6th, which we know was a federally provocateur event at many levels, there were also some useful idiots that got sucked into it in my view, to now project on that, no it's not radical Islam that's the big threat, it's not communist China that's the threat, it's the American people and patriots that are the threat, and with straight faces the CIA has come out and said, oh we believe a civil war has already begun.
[03:58:20.552 --> 03:58:22.696]  We're gonna have to arrest all the leadership?
[03:58:23.077 --> 03:58:26.903]  I mean, this is what a real authoritarian takeover looks like historically.
[03:58:26.923 --> 03:58:30.610]  The most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland is white supremacy.
[03:58:30.630 --> 03:58:33.315]  The most lethal terrorist threat.
