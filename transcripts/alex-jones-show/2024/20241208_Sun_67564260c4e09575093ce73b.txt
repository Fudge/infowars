[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540]  From an associate in Romania.
[00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.360]  And we can show this information that I was sent by a high-level source.
[00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:13.720]  By February 20th, the Biden administration wants to start a war involving the U.S. without the U.S. starting the war.
[00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:19.379]  The logical sequence of events for this purpose will be as follows.
[00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:30.719]  Romania already has troops in Ukraine without publicly acknowledging this blatant We're good to go.
[00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:56.509]  That's their cover for setting up a dictatorship.
[00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.710]  Oh, because we're in a war now.
[00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:58.390]  That's why we did it.
[00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:59.509]  Same thing with Zelenskyy.
[00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:07.540]  The Russians will probably retaliate violently and NATO and Biden's orders will come to Romania's aid with troops already stationed in Romania.
[00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:15.560]  The conflict becomes global through NATO's involvement and therefore the U.S. declares war on Russia.
[00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:25.540]  The Biden administration declares the establishment of a state of war and the suspension of certain democratic rights including the natural course of the outcome of the presidential elections.
[00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:34.510]  Trump will no longer be named President of the United States, and by virtue of the state of war, he will be arrested and his entire staff.
[00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:46.750]  What is happening in Romania is not only a preview of what will happen throughout Europe, but also what will happen in the USA, the establishment of a neo-fascist regime, and dictatorship of the neo-Marxists of Soros.
[00:01:46.950 --> 00:02:07.840]  Very quickly, the conflict will spread throughout the world and the USA. The bandits in Washington hope We'll thus cover the whole of thousands of trillions that has accumulated since 1972 when Nixon gave free reign the printing of dollars without gold backing.
[00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.300]  Yeah, very astute because the old financial order is coming to an end.
[00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.620]  They need a global war as the political smokescreen for that.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.159]  And that's excellent breakdown.
[00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:25.259]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.000]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and support the Infowars.
[00:02:55.789 --> 00:03:06.629]  It is Sunday, December 8th, 2024. I am your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the embattled studios of InfoWars in Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:14.069]  It is Sunday, December 8th, 2024. Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:31.110]  Well, minutes before I just went live, about two minutes ago, three minutes ago, I was writing the headlines for Infowars.com and 4X. And I was so busy doing those, I barely even literally just slid in here seconds ago,
[00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:33.729]  a little bit late, 20 seconds or so, getting on air.
[00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.270]  And I am just...
[00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.280]  Blown away, but at the same time, I am not blown away because I knew that this is exactly what would happen.
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:04:02.159]  So, 42 days out from President Trump being inaugurated, the 47th President of the United States, and with his publicly proposed peace plans to stop this escalation to total war with Russia and China, to name a few others,
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.229]  NATO, on record, has gone in and Staged a coup in Romania.
[00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:28.930]  And because Romania is a NATO country, if Russia does anything to respond to that, well, they'll be able to say that they're at war with Russia,
[00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:33.509]  NATO officially, and violates Article 7. So if one country's under attack, all of them are.
[00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:52.660]  But even if Russia doesn't respond to this big escalation, Romania officially has had troops in Ukraine, but now that they're taking a more aggressive stance and NATO staged an official coup and thrown out the new election of an anti-globalist,
[00:04:52.779 --> 00:05:11.790]  former high-level UN diplomat, then if Romania officially announces that they are At war with Russia,
[00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:15.910]  then by extension, that brings NATO in automatically.
[00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.490]  And we've seen a lot of talk about doing something like this.
[00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.970]  NATO sneak attacking Russia, which they've already been doing with these attackums and storm shadows.
[00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:29.329]  Of course, the biggest contributor to NATO is the United States, 80 plus percent.
[00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:34.970]  I mean, this is really, really, really, really bad.
[00:05:39.269 --> 00:06:02.689]  And then, of course, like you flip a light switch, you've got the overthrow of Syria with Israel, Turkey, and NATO, all part of it, contributing weapons and troops, and the former leader of Al-Qaeda and ISIS in the region looking to be the new leader of Syria and as the leader of the rebels.
[00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:14.810]  And then, of course, you've got People contesting the government and the election in Georgia and NATO trying to overthrow that.
[00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:23.529]  And then you've got the fact that Iran has been having all its tentacles cut off.
[00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.329]  And you can sit back and look at this.
[00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:29.990]  And say, well, I don't like Iran, or I don't like...
[00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:36.709]  Look, the point is, this is all being done to push Russia into full conflict.
[00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:43.470]  And so that's why I put the headline out on X that World War III has begun.
[00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:45.410]  I mean, this is a new world war.
[00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:50.029]  Call it what you want, because the Pentagon argues that really World War III was the Cold War.
[00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.889]  Call it World War IV, whatever you want.
[00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:54.629]  This is global.
[00:06:55.829 --> 00:06:56.269]  And...
[00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:08.110]  The big takeaway is the globalists have continued to escalate ahead of Trump getting into office to hand him a total disaster that's so far gone he can't reverse it.
[00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.389]  With 42 days, 18 hours, 55 minutes, 8, 16 seconds.
[00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:14.189]  I mean, this is just wild.
[00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:36.629]  Alright, I was already tracking this information yesterday and today, and really for the last few weeks, but it's all come to a head, and my analysis that I had not yet put on air was exactly what I was sent about an hour before the broadcast began.
[00:07:37.829 --> 00:07:42.709]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday, December 8th, 2024 transmission.
[00:07:42.709 --> 00:07:44.089]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:47.350]  We are 42 days out from the inauguration of President Trump.
[00:07:47.850 --> 00:08:02.350]  I was sent information on several lengthy articles and documents and breakdowns by a former head of a major U.S. intelligence agency that asked not to be named, so he won't.
[00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:10.569]  And again, I'd already sent videos and articles to the crew throughout the day on this very subject, and that was my analysis of what was happening.
[00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:21.089]  But in the analysis I was sent, it gave me an even greater understanding of exactly what is happening and what is about to happen.
[00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:23.569]  So let me just calmly say this.
[00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:33.129]  I was sitting there about 10 minutes ago before the broadcast began, writing the headline for the live feed we do on X and one for Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:38.220]  Because I like to put a headline up, you know, for seven days a week we're on, and I like to put a...
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:45.279]  We also do other emergency broadcasts and news bulletins, and I'll put the date and time for people and what we're covering, what the main story is.
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.559]  We always cover other stuff as well.
[00:08:48.039 --> 00:09:02.299]  And I was sitting there right before the show, and normally I can write a headline because I'm already ready and know what I'm focused on in just a minute or so, but I sat there for like 10 minutes, right, leading up to the show, just thinking, how the hell...
[00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:09.750]  Do I write this headline and make it accurate and make it horrible enough?
[00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.909]  Let me explain.
[00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.590]  It's not like I was trying to make something more horrible or more dangerous than it was.
[00:09:16.769 --> 00:09:24.210]  I was sitting there thinking, how do I come up with a headline that is bad enough to describe what I really think?
[00:09:26.929 --> 00:09:27.909]  There it is.
[00:09:28.029 --> 00:09:29.789]  And it's not strong enough.
[00:09:29.909 --> 00:09:31.570]  Let's go back to the real Alex Jones headline.
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.620]  Because I wrote that one.
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:39.240]  That one took me like 10 minutes and I had like literally a minute left just for InfoWars and the AJN network.
[00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:41.600]  I wrote those others like in 30 seconds as fast as I could.
[00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:42.840]  They probably got typos on them.
[00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:43.480]  We'll probably fix it.
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.000]  But WW3 has begun.
[00:09:46.539 --> 00:09:52.559]  The globalists have decided to launch a massive destabilization campaign before Trump takes office in 42 days.
[00:09:53.179 --> 00:10:01.080]  Syria, Romania, Georgia have all been plunged into war and chaos as part of a larger plan that Alex Jones is exposing live right now.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.100]  And I said, tune in.
[00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:05.539]  I should have said, please watch, share.
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.659]  But we'll put another headline with that.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.340]  So, that's where we are right now.
[00:10:16.819 --> 00:10:23.220]  And, you know, part of this is obviously, as listener and viewer participation, this is not a spectator sport.
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.320]  This is an information war.
[00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:52.350]  I would ask you all, whether it's Infowars.com forward slash show live feed link or Real Alex Jones on X or whatever local radio station you're listening to that's also restreaming or also on the air, share that with strangers while you're pumping gas or while you're coming home and talking to your wife or husband or if you're at work because That's how we cause the chain reaction to get more people to wake up and understand what's happening.
[00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.509]  So here's a summation, then I'll drill into all of it.
[00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:08.429]  I've been predicting for many months before the election that if Trump could override the fraud with such a landslide too big to rig, that he would still win.
[00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:16.350]  And I had the Rasmussen head of polling on who's recognized as the top pollster in the world.
[00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:21.269]  And he concurred that Trump had a huge landslide in 2016, barely won.
[00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:27.490]  He had a smaller victory, not really a landslide in 2020, so they were able to steal it.
[00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.350]  They also put forward so many fraudulent votes.
[00:11:31.529 --> 00:11:37.250]  And in 2024, it was the biggest landslide ever.
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.899]  Bigger than anything we've seen in the last hundred years.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.580]  And Trump got the popular vote and the electoral college.
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.600]  So it was a moderate, still a landslide, but not a mega landslide.
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.620]  But if you take out all the fraud, biggest landslide ever.
[00:11:52.659 --> 00:11:58.840]  And I said then, the first thing they're going to do is start bombing Russia, NATO will.
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.759]  That means the United States.
[00:12:02.539 --> 00:12:06.039]  As soon as he's president-elect on November 6th.
[00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:12.570]  And that started right away, as you know, within a week.
[00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:28.830]  So that was so unpopular politically everywhere, and then Putin fired that intermediate ballistic missile with MIRVs on it, showing he could pierce Western anti-missile defense systems and deliver dozens of nuclear warheads if he wanted to.
[00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:37.970]  He did it with multiple re-entry devices, controllable devices, With conventional weapons, but it was a demonstration of that.
[00:12:39.669 --> 00:12:43.230]  And they, for now, backed off of that.
[00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:48.350]  And I said on air many times, this is just the next move, obviously.
[00:12:48.929 --> 00:12:51.029]  And I'm pointing that out because I'm going to tell you the next move.
[00:12:52.669 --> 00:13:01.330]  That they would just destabilize other Eastern European countries that have now entered NATO that were formerly part of the Soviet Union.
[00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:08.570]  And we specifically talked about Georgia and Romania as two of the big trigger points.
[00:13:08.769 --> 00:13:17.389]  And if we can, on X, there's excellent historic time-lapses of NATO expansion since it was created at the end of World War II right off the borders with Russia.
[00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:39.370]  So, if any NATO member country gets in a conflict with Russia, if any NATO... Remember,
[00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:43.509]  it's into a conflict with Russia.
[00:13:46.169 --> 00:13:51.330]  Then NATO officially goes to war with Russia because they have defense agreements.
[00:13:54.289 --> 00:14:02.590]  So what's been going on the last week is a anti-globalist former top UN diplomat.
[00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.210]  We played clips of for many years in the broadcast.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:32.360]  One, the presidency, and the intelligence agency of Romania, that's NATO, said, oh, we think there was some Russian interference because there was some TikTok videos that they said might have been funded by Russia.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.740]  Well, all the governments, all the big governments are funding stuff.
[00:14:35.919 --> 00:14:37.779]  Of course there's Russian propaganda.
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.360]  And there's all the pro-EU propaganda.
[00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.029]  And all the Ukrainian propaganda.
[00:14:43.490 --> 00:15:00.210]  But because they say there was some Russian propaganda, just like we saw with Trump in 2016 and 2020, well, the government that's unelected, it's lost power, and not even the outgoing president,
[00:15:00.429 --> 00:15:09.350]  but the bureaucracy said, we are not going to To accept the new president.
[00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.710]  And with no evidence, they said he's a Russian agent.
[00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.889]  Colleen Georgievskou.
[00:15:18.049 --> 00:15:19.570]  Who we should probably get on the show.
[00:15:19.909 --> 00:15:21.570]  I think I've tried to get him on before.
[00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:25.309]  We played the videos of him years ago about I was a top diplomat, which he was.
[00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:30.289]  And I found out they're basically pedophile devil worshippers that are transhumanists in an evil death cult.
[00:15:30.909 --> 00:15:32.470]  He was saying that a decade ago.
[00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.269]  Well, that's all out in the open now.
[00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:39.330]  I mean, look at the manifestation of what the globalists do openly through Hollywood and the culture.
[00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.690]  You don't even need to look at the secret stuff to know what they're into.
[00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:42.769]  They're sick.
[00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:45.090]  They're coming for our children, you name it.
[00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.590]  There's a major rejection of this in traditionalist China, even.
[00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:54.409]  And in Eastern Europe, and people are like, this is crazy.
[00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.990]  So...
[00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:00.549]  The bureaucracy...
[00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.529]  Romania has said we don't accept this.
[00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.509]  So the former president said it's wrong what's happening.
[00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.210]  The other main opposition party leader that lost came out.
[00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:20.710]  I have clips of this coming up.
[00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.649]  A big to tell report said this is wrong.
[00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.409]  I mean this is dictatorship of the intelligence agency.
[00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:37.169]  Remember the 18 intelligence agencies and 127 former intelligence bosses say Trump's a Russian agent.
[00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:44.970]  Trump works for Putin, and the Hunter Biden laptop's not real, and Alex Jones is a Russian.
[00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.610]  I mean, you've heard it all.
[00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:48.970]  You slip on a banana peel, the Russians did it.
[00:16:51.529 --> 00:16:56.370]  Up in Canada, they say people officially in the government don't like Trudeau because they work for the Russians.
[00:16:56.529 --> 00:16:58.649]  No, Trudeau's really a horrible person.
[00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.789]  What the hell do Russians have to do with Canada?
[00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.569]  I mean, do the Russians put out propaganda?
[00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:23.950]  Yeah, almost no one watches RT. I mean, I study propaganda and who's got the flex, and it's Hollywood, the corporate media worldwide, but they're losing their power, and now it's this distributed, independent media that's all different flavors under the rainbow,
[00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:40.079]  and that's who has the big audiences, is the hundreds of millions of people that have shows or programs, and tens of thousands of Western-speaking people that have good-sized shows, and Hundreds that have gigantic shows.
[00:17:40.339 --> 00:17:48.200]  And I mean, I'm in the top 10, but I mean, there's hundreds of shows that reach 10, 20, 30 million people a week.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.599]  Hell, thousands.
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:55.299]  There's not many people that consistently reach 50, 60, 100, 200 million a week.
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.400]  But they're there.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.559]  And it's...
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.839]  Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, the list goes from there.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.240]  And I'm not in competition.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.720]  I just study it because it's interesting.
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.859]  And the corporate media admits that.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.319]  They say, wow, these hosts are more popular now than the old media, than Hollywood.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.059]  We just need to ban them.
[00:18:18.259 --> 00:18:22.019]  Well, more people will just pop up because people don't like establishment crap.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.279]  They don't like scripted, the same globalist BS that's all...
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.740]  Completely obvious and easy to spot.
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.779]  So, their answer is ban, ban, ban, ban, ban.
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.319]  It just makes people want it more.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.640]  But I'm digressing.
[00:18:36.759 --> 00:18:37.619]  People already know about this.
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:46.920]  So the claim, and I've got the articles in the news, New York Times, Washington Post, who are all for, you know, oh yeah, it's good.
[00:18:47.079 --> 00:18:48.920]  Don't accept the Romanian vote.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.700]  And man, look at the evidence.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.500]  They found five TikTok videos that had a couple million views.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.000]  And these are Russians on TikTok.
[00:18:58.819 --> 00:19:02.140]  Well, yeah, Russia borders Romania.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.079]  And NATO is right on their doorstep.
[00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:12.589]  And Romania is part of NATO. And we've singled out Romania with my guests and others.
[00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:20.829]  The late war correspondent, last time he was on, was bringing that up.
[00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.789]  So, this is just crazy.
[00:19:26.109 --> 00:19:42.809]  They can just say, oh look, Russian talk show host talked about Romania and so that influenced That'd be like Mexico saying, we're getting rid of an election of someone that got elected.
[00:19:44.509 --> 00:19:47.349]  You know, the Mexican Intelligence Agency, they've got those.
[00:19:48.369 --> 00:19:59.470]  Said, oh, there were Spanish speakers in America, and their news got into Mexico, so we're saying that's a foreign influence, so we're going to have a coup.
[00:20:00.569 --> 00:20:02.289]  Well, that's what influence is.
[00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.589]  And we got BBC on US television.
[00:20:04.769 --> 00:20:22.589]  Does that mean, oh, we can't have elections now because a bunch of Americans watch the BBC. So, this is a purely NATO. And they admit it's NATO. And now it's been admitted that...
[00:20:23.529 --> 00:20:28.509]  Romania has had troops for at least a year and a half in Ukraine fighting Russians.
[00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:36.369]  And if they officially say that they're at war with Russia because Russia stole their election, that's how they'll flip it.
[00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:39.569]  Oh, well, we've disregarded this election because the Russians stole it.
[00:20:39.589 --> 00:20:43.609]  And now because the Russians are meddling, we're officially at war with Russia.
[00:20:43.829 --> 00:20:44.670]  Look for that.
[00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:50.289]  And I've been told by sources that's the decision already been made by February 20th.
[00:20:59.829 --> 00:21:08.349]  And they will then officially have NATO at war with Russia.
[00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:23.930]  And then we have Zelensky refusing in Paris yesterday, rejecting Trump's peace call, even after Trump got the Speaker of the House to cut $24 billion that was about to be sent there of additional funding last Wednesday.
[00:21:24.809 --> 00:21:28.309]  Zelensky said, hey, I got NATO, I got the UK, I got Germany.
[00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:34.390]  I've got them all on board, and we're just going to accelerate this war.
[00:21:35.809 --> 00:21:44.369]  But instead of bombing Russia, because that didn't work PR-wise with the world to escalate, they pulled back from that for now.
[00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.369]  Who knows, they might start tomorrow or next week.
[00:21:47.369 --> 00:21:47.890]  I don't know.
[00:21:51.179 --> 00:21:55.380]  Instead, oh look, Georgia, you know, their government needs to be overthrown.
[00:21:55.519 --> 00:21:56.079]  It's Russian.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.779]  People don't like the election results there.
[00:21:59.099 --> 00:22:01.380]  Oh, and NATO's like, yeah, overthrow the government.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:06.059]  And then in Romania, they elect an anti-globalist.
[00:22:06.839 --> 00:22:12.720]  And then they say, well, Russian influence, you are not going to be the president.
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.220]  And we won't say we're going to have another election.
[00:22:15.859 --> 00:22:17.200]  Zelensky's canceled elections.
[00:22:17.339 --> 00:22:18.319]  They're the good guys.
[00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:27.869]  And now they've cancelled and totally censored the new president, Colleen George Escu.
[00:22:31.309 --> 00:22:46.569]  Romania's top court annuls first round of presidential vote won by far-right candidate, AP. And they use this evidence in their court.
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:55.319]  Oh, well, the intelligence agency said there were TikTok videos of Russians saying this guy's a good candidate.
[00:22:55.319 --> 00:22:59.900]  He doesn't want World War III. What, the Russians don't get to say what they want?
[00:23:00.339 --> 00:23:01.960]  I mean, we're like children?
[00:23:03.519 --> 00:23:04.819]  We're like two-year-olds?
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.539]  Oh my God, you can't elect who you want.
[00:23:08.539 --> 00:23:09.799]  The Russians made you do that.
[00:23:09.859 --> 00:23:11.980]  Oh, you didn't elect Trump because you liked Trump.
[00:23:13.329 --> 00:23:18.390]  In 2016 or 2020 or 2024, no, Vladimir Putin controls your mind.
[00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:23.650]  That's why you don't want World War III. And then, what else do we have?
[00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:33.250]  Starting about a week ago, you have rebels coming out of, we'll put that on the map, the map of Turkey and Syria.
[00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:34.269]  Can we zoom in on that?
[00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:36.089]  Just north of Israel there.
[00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:38.809]  Turkey, who's had a big beef with Syria forever.
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:46.200]  It has that northern corridor that's always been flooding Jihadistan, that's on record, and floods in a bunch of forces.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:51.119]  And then now the new leader is a former leader of Al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria.
[00:23:51.319 --> 00:23:55.039]  That's who they're saying is the leader of the, probably the new leader of the new country.
[00:23:56.259 --> 00:23:59.640]  Israel just took a bunch of the Golan Heights from Syria.
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.079]  So Israel's expanding.
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.259]  Turkey's saying they're going to take part of Syria.
[00:24:10.829 --> 00:24:11.529]  It's wild.
[00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:23.670]  So, and again, I'm not defending Assad, who's now taking refuge and been granted asylum in Russia.
[00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:43.119]  But the point is, is that the West has been trying to overthrow these countries for a long time, but now suddenly, 42 days before Trump gets into office, Georgia is teetering on collapse,
[00:24:43.279 --> 00:24:43.900]  civil war.
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.640]  NATO admits they're behind that.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:52.279]  They've just had a successful overthrow of Assad and put actual jihadis in.
[00:24:52.759 --> 00:24:54.680]  As usual, our government's funding them.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.519]  The main force came out of Turkey.
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:01.380]  NATO backed.
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:10.519]  And now, Israel just took part of Southern Syria.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.279]  Turkey, if you look on the map, is going to take part of northern Syria.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:44.869]  And I would expect the attacks militarily to begin any day on Iran, but first Israel had to take out Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, And now Syria's out of the way.
[00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.089]  Next stop, Tehran.
[00:25:49.009 --> 00:25:56.349]  I would imagine that Iran will start getting bombed in the next two weeks for sure.
[00:25:56.849 --> 00:26:02.430]  Now the West may stage some stuff and blow some stuff up as a pretext and say the Iranians did it.
[00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:08.849]  Well, the Iranians might be crazy enough to actually do something, but this is it.
[00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.589]  Now, what do you call all this?
[00:26:11.049 --> 00:26:14.970]  North Korea a month ago blowing up its bridges and railways into South Korea and saying we're at war.
[00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:18.650]  G.G.P.ing five weeks ago saying prepare for total war.
[00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:24.650]  For the first time ever with the West, with South Korea, with Japan, with the United States.
[00:26:25.869 --> 00:26:33.470]  Putin saying a state of war exists between Russia and NATO. And then the West firing missiles into Russia.
[00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:39.809]  And then now Georgia, Romania, Syria.
[00:26:40.529 --> 00:26:42.430]  I would expect more now.
[00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:46.670]  Big provocations, good chance the globalists will stage.
[00:26:53.289 --> 00:26:57.329]  Some attacks and blaming on Russia.
[00:26:59.799 --> 00:27:08.599]  And I notice we're putting up here, and I don't raise this because I'm the one that brought up Israel took part of Syria.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:13.240]  And that that's going on.
[00:27:13.839 --> 00:27:16.680]  And that Turkey's grabbing part of the north.
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.259]  And that that's part of Israel's greater expansion.
[00:27:20.539 --> 00:27:22.420]  But then that kind of became a focus here.
[00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:23.039]  The crew's great.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.400]  They just go and kind of grab whatever I'm talking about.
[00:27:24.619 --> 00:27:26.440]  That's not the focus of the whole show today.
[00:27:27.349 --> 00:27:31.130]  The focus is, what is all of this?
[00:27:32.089 --> 00:27:38.009]  What do you call all over the world conflict, the world breaking up in different power blocks?
[00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.529]  You call that a world war.
[00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:46.769]  What do you call a million dead in the Ukraine war?
[00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:48.390]  That's a conservative number now.
[00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:49.650]  It was 600,000.
[00:27:50.049 --> 00:27:53.009]  Now, before there was 600,000 conservative, a million high.
[00:27:53.089 --> 00:27:55.130]  Now they're saying, eh, a million's probably right, probably conservative.
[00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:57.250]  So what do you call a million dead?
[00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:02.009]  What do you call all these conflicts popping up?
[00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:12.950]  And it being these two different power blocks, Russia and China, that's the power block through its proxies with Europe, the UK, and the United States.
[00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:16.930]  What it is, is really, really bad.
[00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:22.990]  And so I said weeks ago, it's not about me saying, I told you so.
[00:28:23.109 --> 00:28:25.230]  It's about, this is easy to know.
[00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.809]  So when I tell you the next stuff coming, please listen.
[00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:33.930]  But back when I had an extra six, seven crew, they could just, we've been crushed down with less crew, but that's okay.
[00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:35.029]  We're reaching more people than ever.
[00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:50.880]  But I could have the crew to go find Days ago, weeks ago, when I said I would see them stirring up conflict, triggering crises, probably somewhere like Romania, getting a conflict there, having a coup there,
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.200]  using that as a detonator to bring NATO fully into the war.
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.660]  And now, that's happening.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:07.700]  And we've had multiple guests on that, in the last few months, specifically predicted that.
[00:29:10.099 --> 00:29:26.000]  And so, I want to go to break here and come back and hit the articles and tie into this and then read to you the intel that I got from the former head of a major U.S. intelligence agency on the intel.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:37.359]  They got specifically, but by February 20th, is what they were told, probably before, we will be completely at war with Russia officially.
[00:29:38.339 --> 00:29:39.359]  So that is the plan.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.200]  It is official.
[00:29:40.359 --> 00:29:41.319]  Going to war with Russia.
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.140]  We tried to stop it.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.500]  There may still be time to stop it.
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:30:00.259]  So, NATO has officially in the last two weeks supported the attempted overthrow of the elected government in Georgia.
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:12.359]  That is not even pro-Russia, but is pro-sovereignty and anti-World War III. And their president got up in speeches we played here and said, this is the new world order.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.259]  This is globalist.
[00:30:13.539 --> 00:30:15.140]  They want us to be part of war with Russia.
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:16.079]  We're not going to be.
[00:30:17.049 --> 00:30:19.549]  And NATO is still trying to overthrow Georgia.
[00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:22.789]  They have officially overthrown the Assad regime.
[00:30:23.289 --> 00:30:24.470]  I'm neutral on that.
[00:30:24.609 --> 00:30:27.549]  I don't support hereditary dictatorships.
[00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:41.009]  But now they're going to put jihadists in control of the country and divide it up between We're good to go.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:58.579]  And you had Israel and the United States and Obama trying to overthrow Assad during that 10-year war that killed hundreds of thousands.
[00:30:58.839 --> 00:31:02.799]  I mean, this is just, you've got Wesley Clark famously talking about the plan to overthrow Syria.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.099]  They're not doing anything to us.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.079]  And then we're going to put people even worse in charge.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:09.980]  It's like Gaddafi.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:20.460]  Loved Obama, believed him, invested all of Libya's money, apologized, and then they set him up and killed him.
[00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:23.470]  I mean, why?
[00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:32.809]  And then now they admit that Libya was one of the best countries in Africa, and it's one of the worst now, and is a hellhole run by jihadists.
[00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:46.630]  I mean, that's who our government backs, and then Europe and the United States open the borders and bring the refugees of the wars we create in here with replacement migration.
[00:31:50.009 --> 00:31:53.690]  So, 100%, I ask the question, will the globalists back off?
[00:31:53.809 --> 00:31:55.470]  Will they stop ahead of Trump getting in?
[00:31:56.349 --> 00:32:01.569]  Could he get the funding cut through Speaker Johnson, which he did, and they don't care.
[00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:11.849]  They are 100%, I'm not predicting this now, it happened, escalating into full war with Russia, and Russia's been very restrained.
[00:32:12.869 --> 00:32:18.880]  If you even read mainline policy wonks, They go, well, Russia keeps letting us pass red lines.
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:19.619]  Let's keep pushing.
[00:32:19.839 --> 00:32:21.380]  Well, what's Russia supposed to do?
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:22.839]  Go to full nuclear war?
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:32.680]  And so the thinking of Lloyd Austin, Secretary of Defense and others, is you heard him two weeks ago.
[00:32:32.779 --> 00:32:33.259]  We played the clip.
[00:32:33.339 --> 00:32:40.339]  He said, oh, it's just a bluff is to keep overthrowing countries next to Russia and moving weapons up to their border.
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.759]  That's that's aggressive.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.839]  That's provocative.
[00:32:48.759 --> 00:32:50.140]  That's escalatory.
[00:32:52.079 --> 00:32:54.500]  And, you know, Trump's like, hey, Assad's gone.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.480]  Maybe that's a good thing.
[00:32:55.599 --> 00:32:56.519]  Hope it turns out okay.
[00:32:56.519 --> 00:32:57.819]  Let's not be involved.
[00:32:58.299 --> 00:32:58.500]  Yeah.
[00:32:59.019 --> 00:33:00.799]  But we are involved.
[00:33:01.599 --> 00:33:03.259]  You know, that's Trump yesterday.
[00:33:03.259 --> 00:33:04.599]  Now it's all admitted.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.980]  NATO, Assad, Israel.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:21.109]  And Israel and Assad, excuse me, Israel and Turkey, Are admitting this.
[00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:29.609]  And it's not even denied they're sending in al-Qaeda and ISIS. And you hear, you see headlines, U.S. bombing ISIS targets in Syria.
[00:33:33.569 --> 00:33:39.089]  And I'm sure that the West will now turn on some of the jihadis they just used to go in there.
[00:33:39.529 --> 00:33:42.349]  But still, what type of policy is that?
[00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:43.849]  This is insanity.
[00:33:45.569 --> 00:33:46.470]  I remember what came out.
[00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:48.490]  Trump was like, we're not backing ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:58.509]  They'd say, yes, sir, and kept U.S. troops there and kept funding the war against Assad for the first two years of administration until he found out and started removing people over it.
[00:33:59.769 --> 00:34:12.050]  Then they called him a Russian agent because he didn't want to have a war with Russia because even the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, the outgoing head, had told Obama you can't do that and told Congress you can't do that.
[00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:22.849]  That's World War III. So, look at these headlines.
[00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:26.170]  Zelensky rejects Trump's peace call.
[00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:32.809]  Biden regime announces another billion more to Ukraine that they already had stashed away that Congress didn't approve.
[00:34:33.309 --> 00:34:34.389]  Trump stopped the 24 billion.
[00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:36.909]  Then it gets into this.
[00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:43.869]  Romanian court annuls, like it's a marriage, presidential election results and orders a new vote.
[00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:50.329]  Colleen Georgia Q, I can't ever say it right.
[00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:58.030]  Georgescu, Colleen Georgescu, who we've covered for years, was a top UN diplomat, anti-globalist.
[00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:16.250]  The intelligence agency of Romania, openly run by NATO, said, well, Russian news got into our country, and so because they mind-controlled our people, because they don't want World War III with Russia, you don't need to be mind-controlled to not want that.
[00:35:18.719 --> 00:35:24.159]  And because Eastern Europe's rejecting Hollywood and the left, just like we are, they're like, we don't want any part of that.
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.699]  We don't want Russia running things, and we don't want you running things.
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:27.480]  We want our own country.
[00:35:27.559 --> 00:35:28.219]  That's what they say.
[00:35:28.679 --> 00:35:29.599]  Doesn't that make sense?
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:39.300]  Oh, because you don't want a World War III, we are going to say your election doesn't count.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.380]  Well, who's that?
[00:35:40.539 --> 00:35:42.639]  Oh, the intelligence agency of Romania.
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:46.699]  And then they go to their Supreme Court, and they say, yeah.
[00:35:47.659 --> 00:35:50.500]  We're annulling this, and we're not going to say when the next election is.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:58.960]  Sounds like Zelensky, a year ago, his term ran out, and he said, no more elections, as he arrested his political opposition on the rest of it.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:03.320]  So, this is a big deal.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.539]  People say, well, I don't care about Romania.
[00:36:04.699 --> 00:36:06.719]  Well, it cares about you.
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:15.480]  Drag us into World War III. Romania's far-right presidential candidate denounces canceled vote at closed polling station.
[00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:23.869]  Romania's far-right presidential candidate denounces.
[00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:28.969]  Excellent breakdown by TPV News.
[00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:29.909]  I'm going to play a clip of this again.
[00:36:30.349 --> 00:36:35.110]  Romania's rightful president, New World Order, trying to kill me for exposing satanic agenda.
[00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:36.250]  Yeah, we're going to play clips of it in a moment.
[00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:43.510]  Germany promises, Deutschland promises, AI-powered attack drones for Ukraine.
[00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.909]  So it's escalating very, very quickly.
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:57.219]  But what I wanted to get into here is this information.
[00:36:57.699 --> 00:37:00.440]  And we'll get into Syria and why that's so important.
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:06.320]  But if you just tuned in, I know tens of thousands tune in every second or every minute or so.
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.480]  We shouldn't be involved in the Middle East.
[00:37:13.579 --> 00:37:14.920]  We shouldn't be involved in Eastern Europe.
[00:37:15.019 --> 00:37:16.360]  We shouldn't be messing with the Russians.
[00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:19.190]  That's globalism.
[00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:22.989]  And the same globalists trying to mess with them or messing with us.
[00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:25.369]  But look at these articles.
[00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:26.329]  This is an excellent one.
[00:37:26.969 --> 00:37:30.190]  Sent to me by a former U.S. intelligence head that's unnamed.
[00:37:30.869 --> 00:37:33.150]  Israel's love affair with Syrian jihadists.
[00:37:33.289 --> 00:37:53.199]  Excellent, very lengthy breakdown by Keith Woods of Israel openly funding Al-Qaeda and ISIS. Same thing with Turkey, and then here's Netanyahu today announcing they're taking part of Syria.
[00:37:56.019 --> 00:38:11.320]  But I want to read to you what I was sent, specifically how they're going to use, NATO's going to use,
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:22.309]  before February 20th, Romania, as the detonator to officially get NATO into war, that decision's been made.
[00:38:22.489 --> 00:38:23.329]  I want to explain something.
[00:38:23.429 --> 00:38:24.369]  This is not speculation.
[00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:39.530]  Our source has talked directly to people inside the government and inside NATO and inside Europe that say, no, we've been told we're going to full war with Russia by the 20th, and this scenario is going to happen by then.
[00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:45.309]  So I want to get to a large section of this excellent breakdown report.
[00:38:46.250 --> 00:39:01.050]  And then I'm going to come back and read to you the actual intel exclusively here from inside NATO of what has been decided to do for going to full war with Russia and its ally China by February 20th of next year.
[00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:02.030]  Here's the report.
[00:39:04.119 --> 00:39:11.920]  Romania's rightful president, Carlene Georgescu, is waging a battle against a rigged judiciary and a global elite desperate to silence him forever.
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:12.900]  Why?
[00:39:13.199 --> 00:39:19.039]  Because he dared to expose their darkest secrets, secrets he uncovered during his tenure as a UN executive.
[00:39:19.539 --> 00:39:27.679]  According to Dijescu, the global elite is rotten to the core, a network of compromised paedophiles driven by power, greed and even more sinister motives.
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.539]  But he's not backing down.
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:34.579]  His mission is clear, to lead Romania out of the shadows and into the light.
[00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:37.949]  And that's exactly why they're determined to destroy him.
[00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:44.949]  The mainstream media are desperately trying to suppress this information because it implicates those at the very top of the globalist hierarchy.
[00:39:45.409 --> 00:39:48.690]  But the more desperate they get, the more careless they become.
[00:39:48.989 --> 00:39:51.869]  And we've got the inside scoop and all the details coming up.
[00:39:51.989 --> 00:40:01.010]  As it turns out, spending decades at an executive role at the UN only to blow the whistle on the compromised paedophiles running the organisation is a very dangerous move.
[00:40:01.409 --> 00:40:10.050]  Now the global elite have intervened to overturn the results of Romania's presidential election, specifically targeting insurgent candidate Carlin Jojescu.
[00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:20.489]  Running a grassroots campaign with little to no major funding, Jojescu's nationalist anti-globalist platform resonated deeply with the population desperate to rid the country of globalist sellouts.
[00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:25.409]  But now the election results have been annulled and Jojescu himself is being cancelled.
[00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:26.409]  Why?
[00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:31.030]  Allegedly because Russia ran some TikTok ads that might have influenced voters.
[00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:32.349]  Yes, really.
[00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:34.969]  This is the Russian collusion hoax 2.0.
[00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:37.670]  Except this time the hoax is on steroids.
[00:40:39.769 --> 00:40:43.530]  Romania's vast parliament building lit up in the darkness.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:51.480]  The decision of the court here echoed around the world, cancelling an election because of alleged interference by Russia.
[00:40:53.199 --> 00:41:03.400]  Authorities here believe Moscow amplified the social media campaign of populist Karlyn Chorchewski, who had risen from obscurity to become the front-runner to win the presidency.
[00:41:04.139 --> 00:41:13.880]  But these documents from the Secret Service allege he was backed by Russia, something he denied when we spoke just 24 hours before the election was called off.
[00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:18.730]  Even then, Georgescu claimed the state was trying to block him.
[00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:26.769]  They asked and they met for one purpose to eliminate one of the candidates.
[00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:38.750]  I mean, you know, how many problems has Romania today and they are doing this meeting just for this purpose, which is incredible.
[00:41:39.469 --> 00:41:42.469]  I mean, where is the democracy?
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:57.039]  His rival also condemning the decision, saying it failed the democracy Romania had built since the fall of communism in 1989. I strongly condemn what happened today.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:02.679]  I think they destroyed everything we have worked so hard to achieve in the last 35 years.
[00:42:04.119 --> 00:42:08.340]  The election won't be rerun until next year, but nobody knows when.
[00:42:09.389 --> 00:42:13.949]  George Eskew's groundbreaking presidential campaign couldn't have arrived at a more critical moment.
[00:42:14.389 --> 00:42:23.210]  The global elite are in panic mode, pulling every string to cling to their power and push forward their Agenda 2030 and so-called sustainable development goals.
[00:42:23.449 --> 00:42:24.550]  Their ultimate aim?
[00:42:24.769 --> 00:42:30.690]  To impose a dystopian technocratic system that threatens to enslave humanity under the guise of progress.
[00:42:31.239 --> 00:42:36.820]  The global elites will stop at nothing to hold on to their power, no matter how blatant their actions become.
[00:42:37.039 --> 00:42:47.079]  Their desperation is only rivalled by their hypocrisy, as they openly undermine democratic values, yet claim that cancelling an election is somehow a way to protect democracy.
[00:42:47.519 --> 00:43:05.050]  But the situation in Romania is even more alarming because they are a NATO member state, and the global elites are desperate to escalate tensions with Russia before the Trump presidency, pushing the world closer to the brink of World War III. The decision of the Constitutional Court here is a seismic,
[00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:20.929]  unprecedented moment for Romania, but it will resonate with the wider world because this is a member state of NATO, claiming that it's been attacked, that its democracy has been undermined, and naming Russia as the aggressor.
[00:43:21.719 --> 00:43:30.179]  Anyone surprised that the global elite would be shameless enough to overrule the results of a national election clearly hasn't been paying attention to recent events.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:40.300]  Klaus Schwab's right-hand man and self-confessed psychopath Yuval Noah Harari has admitted that if Trump and patriots like Drogescu are not stopped, it will be the death blow of the global order.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.659]  Are you concerned that Trump might be elected again?
[00:43:43.079 --> 00:43:44.539]  I think it's very likely.
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:49.219]  And if it happens, it is likely to be the kind of like the death blow.
[00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:52.769]  to what remains of the global order.
[00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:55.550]  And he says it openly.
[00:43:56.090 --> 00:44:13.539]  Now again, it should be clear that many of these politicians They present a false dichotomy, a false binary vision of the world, as if you have to choose between patriotism and globalism,
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:21.980]  between being loyal to your nation and being loyal to some kind of, I don't know, global government or whatever.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.699]  As usual, Harari was lying through his teeth.
[00:44:26.079 --> 00:44:33.960]  It is impossible to be loyal to your nation while serving the vision of a one-world global government that Harari and his cronies are promoting.
[00:44:34.429 --> 00:44:39.349]  Especially when the global elite leave their fingerprints all over events that directly impact we the people.
[00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:42.409]  We've extensively documented the role of this cabal.
[00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:51.869]  Figures like Gates and Schwab in orchestrating the Covid pandemic, manipulating the mainstream media, pushing an agenda to normalise paedophilia and rigging elections.
[00:44:51.969 --> 00:44:54.090]  And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:44:54.389 --> 00:44:56.250]  Their list of schemes seems endless.
[00:44:56.809 --> 00:45:04.650]  Now, the global elite have left their fingerprints all over a shocking decision by the Romanian Supreme Court to annul the results of a presidential election.
[00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:05.449]  Why?
[00:45:05.789 --> 00:45:08.869]  Because they don't approve of the candidates chosen by the people.
[00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:12.130]  It's no surprise when you take a closer look at his policies.
[00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:13.590]  His agenda is clear.
[00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:20.570]  Kicking the globalist elite out of Romania and putting his country first, not the globalist overlords in Davos and Brussels.
[00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:23.510]  As he boldly puts it, what does it mean?
[00:45:23.849 --> 00:45:26.289]  It means that we will stand and not kneel.
[00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:41.929]  Are you accused, or are you accused, that you are pro-Rus, pro-Putin, against NATO, against UE? Are you accused of pro-Putin, against UE? Are you accused of pro-Putin or pro-Rus?
[00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:43.789]  First of all, I am pro-Romani.
[00:45:44.409 --> 00:45:45.050]  That's how I am to be.
[00:45:46.250 --> 00:46:06.110]  The second thing is that I don't want to, and I don't want to, as I'm accused of Romania from UE or NATO, But I can say that in any state meeting or in the international community,
[00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:11.289]  we will negotiate only the German international interest.
[00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:13.349]  What does this mean?
[00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:18.590]  I declare today, with the subject and predicates, that we will stand in the legs, not in the genunchi.
[00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:20.250]  But the political class...
[00:46:21.619 --> 00:46:24.280]  Asta s-a observat de foarte mulți ani de zile.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:29.159]  A avut un complex de inferioritate atunci când s-a întâlnit cu Vestul sau cu Occidentul.
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.019]  Acest lucru va lua sfârșit.
[00:46:31.199 --> 00:46:33.639]  Vom juca și vom vorbi de la egal la egal.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:34.800]  Asta voi face eu.
[00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:44.679]  This is the anti-globalist message so powerful that the elites felt compelled to annul an election and postpone it indefinitely in the heart of the European Union.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.260]  But don't think they're done with Georgescu yet.
[00:46:47.659 --> 00:46:54.440]  According to a WF insider, Romania's rightful president, the People's President, has every reason to fear for his life.
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:47:02.739]  If the elite have their way, 2025 will mark the return of political assassinations, with Georgescu at the very top of their list.
[00:47:04.329 --> 00:47:10.010]  The mainstream media is in full spin mode, frantically portraying the annulled election as a legitimate move.
[00:47:10.289 --> 00:47:16.590]  They're even calling it the Romanian version of the Russia-Russia-Russia collusion hoax we saw in the United States.
[00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:19.929]  But let's be honest, this story doesn't hold water.
[00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:23.650]  The cracks are showing, and the people are starting to see through the facade.
[00:47:24.369 --> 00:47:30.409]  Carleen Drogescu is the People's President, and the Global League are doing everything they can to silence their voice.
[00:47:42.029 --> 00:47:43.469]  Alright, let's stop here.
[00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:59.389]  Robert Fico, also a leader in one of the Eastern European countries, Slovakia, got shot, closed at five, six times, barely left, because he didn't want to have war with Russia.
[00:48:00.809 --> 00:48:07.730]  It's been a politically motivated attack by a pro-war, pro-Ukraine war person.
[00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:14.650]  And we already had a U.S. mercenary that had been in Ukraine come to try to kill Trump at the golf course.
[00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:15.590]  You all know about that.
[00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:18.269]  So this is serious business.
[00:48:19.449 --> 00:48:26.949]  And again, the big takeaway here is this is how world wars start.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:42.480]  I told you three weeks ago that within a few days I would imagine the different top military heads and others would start saying that World War III or a new world war has begun or that we're at war with Russia, that Russia would say they're at war with the West, and that no longer would be a proxy war or hybrid war.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:56.820]  And now you've seen Putin, you've seen the MI6, you've seen the head of the NATO Military Council, Bauer, Admiral Bauer, you've seen the Swedes, the Germans, say prepare for nuclear war.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:04.500]  And if you study the first two world wars, they didn't call them world wars at the time.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.880]  You just wake up in one.
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:15.519]  And we are being sleptwalked, sleepwalked into this.
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:22.840]  And the globalists want to continue their UN treaty to take over our bodies with the new pandemic treaty.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:27.900]  They want to get their new global cashless society ESG social credit score.
[00:49:29.239 --> 00:49:30.139]  System in.
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:31.360]  That's their main mission.
[00:49:31.519 --> 00:49:34.139]  They want their global carbon tax control system.
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.980]  They openly want all of this.
[00:49:39.159 --> 00:49:41.300]  They want to keep their people in power.
[00:49:43.699 --> 00:49:52.059]  And so they'll do anything, including risk nuclear war, to get it.
[00:49:53.239 --> 00:49:54.239]  So what are the tracks?
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:50:00.099]  Release a new virus or viruses or hype up deaths already happening from the poison shot.
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.920]  Say there's new diseases, use that for new lockdowns.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.380]  They're proposing that, pushing it everywhere.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:16.539]  You've got the spokespersons for the UN and for Big Pharma like Hotez and others saying, we need to have NATO, we need to have the military, we need to have Homeland Security arrest people that are against the next lockdown.
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:20.500]  You have the former head of Google, still the big owner of it.
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:23.780]  Eric Schmidt sang that at Stanford two months ago.
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:45.920]  We've got the Democrats saying that, oh, Trump's going to attack and kill migrants, and then we're going to have a civil war, we're going to have blue cities and states secede, and then if Trump calls out the military, he's a dictator, and we've got the military leaders saying we're not going to follow illegal orders,
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:51.860]  and then the Ninth Circuit says those are legal orders, not to kill illegals, but to deport them.
[00:50:53.159 --> 00:51:00.579]  So they have the race-based trigger cover for a civil emergency slash martial law to remove Trump.
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:02.500]  That's a big track.
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:10.539]  The new virus or new pandemic fear-mongering to take control of his agenda and shut down the economy even if he stays in office.
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:28.159]  They've got the big war track that I was saying if they start overthrowing more countries on the board with Russia or saying Russia's trying to overthrow one, And we even singled out Romania,
[00:51:28.539 --> 00:51:31.739]  General Flynn, Scott Bennett, and others.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:32.900]  General Flynn is on tomorrow.
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:42.380]  And then I have another source that doesn't want to be named that sent me information that I'll cover when we start the next hour.
[00:51:43.429 --> 00:51:50.469]  And then we've got the entire Middle East being handed over to Wahhabists, and I don't like Iran's Shiite movement either.
[00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:54.630]  But remember, the Muslims fight with each other more than they fight with us.
[00:51:55.070 --> 00:52:08.289]  So you've got the Shiites, controlled by Iran, hereditary Mohammedans, who believe it's like a royal bloodline for Mohammed, and they're roughly 19% of Islam.
[00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:20.780]  And then you've got 79% being Wahhabists and another 2 or 3% being other little groups.
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.420]  And they're fighting.
[00:52:22.679 --> 00:52:35.380]  And so Israel and America and the West have made a deal with Saudi Arabia to remove all of the Shiites and create a unified Wahhabist.
[00:52:35.619 --> 00:52:37.340]  That's Al-Qaeda movement.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.820]  I've got maps and documents on that.
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:40.300]  They're not even denying this.
[00:52:41.199 --> 00:52:44.199]  So, yeah, I don't support our government doing that.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.579]  I don't support Israel doing that.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:48.079]  I don't support Israel creating Hamas.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:58.179]  And I don't come at that from an anti-Israel perspective, just like I'm against our own government doing things it's doing.
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:00.699]  It's also part of that.
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:07.920]  I don't blame all the American people for it, but I am against the destabilization processes of Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:16.739]  And I understand divide and conquer and Israel's arguments, but it's beyond defending yourself of divide and conquer.
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.460]  It's stirring up divide and conquer to conquer.
[00:53:20.219 --> 00:53:23.000]  And that's what General Wesley Clark confessed to.
[00:53:23.179 --> 00:53:24.019]  That's in the documents.
[00:53:24.019 --> 00:53:24.500]  That's admitted.
[00:53:24.639 --> 00:53:25.619]  It's all coming up next hour.
[00:53:26.099 --> 00:53:34.199]  Please remember, the real power of this broadcast is you deciding to share the link at Real Alex Jones and at AJM Live on X, the live feeds.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:38.599]  Instead of getting 5-10 million viewers on there, we'll get 20, 30, 40, 50 million if you do that.
[00:53:39.389 --> 00:53:40.929]  And then tell those who share it to share it.
[00:53:40.969 --> 00:53:42.110]  The second hour is coming up.
[00:53:42.489 --> 00:53:44.150]  But this is really bad.
[00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:46.469]  And the public is not really aware of this.
[00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:48.750]  I think everything's fine because Trump's coming in.
[00:53:48.849 --> 00:53:52.469]  But the globalists have officially brought us into a new world war.
[00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:53.769]  The question is, will it go nuclear?
[00:53:54.329 --> 00:53:55.869]  It's all coming up next hour.
[00:53:55.989 --> 00:54:00.869]  But please share the links from Infowars.com forward slash show and video on Real Alex Jones.
[00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:02.969]  And there's a big federal hearing tomorrow.
[00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:04.449]  Infowars could be shut down tomorrow.
[00:54:04.469 --> 00:54:05.130]  I'll tell you about that.
[00:54:07.679 --> 00:54:09.219]  That is a badass shirt.
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:12.019]  That is the best Trump 47 shirt out there.
[00:54:12.139 --> 00:54:13.300]  That is my idea.
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:19.320]  And I knew that the Verizon, you know, better coverage than Verizon Trump shirt would be a big seller.
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.480]  It is a best seller.
[00:54:20.639 --> 00:54:21.559]  I think this is way better.
[00:54:21.679 --> 00:54:22.719]  I'm going to wear this.
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.539]  This is the Trump shirt I'm going to wear.
[00:54:24.699 --> 00:54:27.739]  That's available at the AlexJonesStore.com.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:28.860]  And this is a war.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.739]  It takes money to win wars.
[00:54:30.739 --> 00:54:31.920]  And they got it in stock.
[00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:33.130]  They're making them right now.
[00:54:33.289 --> 00:54:36.010]  They are shipping within two days of your order coming in.
[00:54:36.269 --> 00:54:38.849]  You gotta get your orders in by the 16th to get it before Christmas.
[00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:40.030]  It's all shipped out of Arkansas.
[00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:41.329]  They do the t-shirts.
[00:54:41.449 --> 00:54:41.909]  They make them.
[00:54:41.969 --> 00:54:42.570]  They make it all.
[00:54:42.809 --> 00:54:44.090]  And they ship out of Arkansas.
[00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:45.030]  They have their own fulfillment center.
[00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:46.130]  They are great patriots.
[00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:46.449]  You know them.
[00:54:46.469 --> 00:54:46.989]  We've had them in here.
[00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:51.590]  There's over 250 designs of t-shirts, ball caps, and hoodies now at thealexshownstore.com.
[00:54:51.730 --> 00:55:02.150]  It is definitely the biggest patriot, anti-New World Order, Trump, anti-globalist, 1776 Americana clothing shop in the galaxy.
[00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:06.250]  So, the best Trump gear, the best patriot gear, the best InfoWars gear, it's all there.
[00:55:06.409 --> 00:55:07.429]  Thealexshownstore.com.
[00:55:18.329 --> 00:55:23.210]  All right, we are into our number two of this live Sunday transmission.
[00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:34.050]  A lot of stations, we're on over 450 stations, do not carry the first six minutes, but the internet does, so I like to do this five minutes.
[00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:48.199]  But I'm going to get back into the big global conflict, World War III escalation that is so It's so dangerous and so historic and so incredibly happening.
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:49.659]  I mean, it's not coming.
[00:55:50.659 --> 00:55:51.679]  It's here.
[00:55:52.099 --> 00:55:58.539]  And I want to go into the meat and potatoes of it and then talk about the different scenarios that will come out of this on the current trajectory.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:06.800]  And if you go back six months ago, three months ago, a month ago, last week, I mean, I continue to nail it because this is not hard.
[00:56:07.059 --> 00:56:08.699]  This has all been war-gamed out.
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:15.610]  And By myself and by General Flynn and by major think tanks.
[00:56:16.389 --> 00:56:26.909]  And the Pentagon comes out with the same scenarios but says, oh, we're going to win this war and we don't think the Russians will use nukes, but even if they do, we'll win that.
[00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:28.090]  Well, nobody wins that.
[00:56:28.469 --> 00:56:29.949]  So I'm going to get to that coming up.
[00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:38.889]  But with such a giant audience and such important stuff going on, for the full audience, I'm not going to talk about myself coming up next segment.
[00:56:38.909 --> 00:56:40.070]  I'm going to get this out of the way now.
[00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:41.469]  But it is a big deal.
[00:56:42.989 --> 00:56:55.289]  There's been a long saga for decades, but intensely for seven years with the Democratic Party and Michael Bloomberg and everybody suing me with these big PR-rigged court cases to try to shut us down and fake billion-and-a-half-dollar judgments.
[00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:57.469]  They asked for $2.76 trillion.
[00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:58.610]  I know that doesn't sound real.
[00:56:58.829 --> 00:56:59.949]  It's just totally insane.
[00:57:01.429 --> 00:57:02.489]  They've done all this.
[00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:08.389]  And then twice in the last six months, they've had U.S. trustees from the Justice Department without court orders try to close the building.
[00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:10.389]  They even came here and turned the Internet off on...
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:16.900]  November 14th, coming up on a month ago, and said The Onion owned it, and now they admit in court documents.
[00:57:17.079 --> 00:57:28.420]  It's really the Bloomberg's Everytown gun control group, and they bragged about it, so they got real issues.
[00:57:29.699 --> 00:57:36.699]  And there is the evidentiary hearing tomorrow that the judge won it.
[00:57:38.039 --> 00:57:41.619]  Now, the judge ordered the quote, owner of the onion to be deposed.
[00:57:41.719 --> 00:57:42.719]  They said they're not doing it.
[00:57:44.199 --> 00:57:46.139]  There's going to be some fireworks there.
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:54.199]  The judge said at a hearing two weeks ago, almost two weeks ago, two Mondays ago, 13 days ago, that they really shouldn't be calling themselves Infowars, that they did not buy it.
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:58.079]  He didn't need to do a temporary restraining order to stop doing it.
[00:57:58.079 --> 00:57:59.039]  He said they're smart.
[00:57:59.239 --> 00:57:59.900]  They don't own it.
[00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:00.679]  They better stop it.
[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:02.039]  Well, they don't care.
[00:58:02.119 --> 00:58:03.699]  They still go around saying they own this.
[00:58:04.079 --> 00:58:07.860]  That's major causes of action there, and I am suing them, and that takes money to do that, obviously.
[00:58:09.019 --> 00:58:10.800]  But we've survived so many times.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.000]  A couple different things happen.
[00:58:12.079 --> 00:58:13.000]  People think, well...
[00:58:13.949 --> 00:58:16.210]  You know, Jones has survived this long.
[00:58:16.369 --> 00:58:17.369]  He'll survive the next time.
[00:58:18.889 --> 00:58:21.550]  It's all by the grace of God that we've survived this long in your support.
[00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:25.530]  And then other people say, well, there's no way you're going to win.
[00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:28.969]  So, you know, this is a big deal.
[00:58:30.449 --> 00:58:38.530]  So if they shut down these historic studios and take over Infowars, we will go out of our backup studios that I don't own and that aren't mine.
[00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:40.610]  And so the bad guys have no claim to try to get those.
[00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:43.190]  They don't own the sponsor, the AlexJonesStore.com.
[00:58:44.090 --> 00:58:45.349]  That's the great folks at Bigly.
[00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:46.849]  So we're going to continue on.
[00:58:47.809 --> 00:58:49.989]  And the bigger studio is almost done as well right now.
[00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:51.630]  We just have the basic one-man studio.
[00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:52.690]  It's nice and works well.
[00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:55.289]  Have a Rush Limbaugh style studio.
[00:58:56.329 --> 00:58:59.909]  So we're not going to give up one way or the other.
[00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:02.730]  But it is a big deal tomorrow in Houston.
[00:59:03.889 --> 00:59:07.050]  And the U.S. trustee called the security people last week.
[00:59:08.639 --> 00:59:15.360]  And said, well, you know, if the judge approves the sale, we're going to turn the show off as soon as he rules that.
[00:59:16.559 --> 00:59:18.380]  Well, the judge never even said they could have an auction.
[00:59:18.539 --> 00:59:19.280]  He didn't even know they were going to.
[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:22.420]  He said they could have one in the future, but he had to have hearings about what could even be sold.
[00:59:22.679 --> 00:59:24.940]  So I don't imagine the judge is going to do that tomorrow.
[00:59:25.139 --> 00:59:31.800]  But if the judge is specific, this guy will do that because he said that's what the plaintiffs want.
[00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:34.449]  So it's all about taking us off the air.
[00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:43.250]  So just remember that, that the globalists want this show off the air because it's effective, it tells the truth, and it's promoting peace and justice and liberty.
[00:59:43.690 --> 00:59:46.230]  So remember, the bad guys don't want this getting out.
[00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:50.369]  It'd be a terrible thing if you shared the links to the articles and told everybody to tune in.
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:41.360]  All right, let me finish up with the global escalation into total World War III news.
[01:00:42.679 --> 01:00:44.800]  And I'll get to the most important points now.
[01:00:45.219 --> 01:00:47.139]  And then I'm going to turn to Trump.
[01:00:48.199 --> 01:00:59.500]  And what he's been announcing, what he's been doing, how he is fulfilling, going after the promises that he made.
[01:01:00.159 --> 01:01:13.639]  He's doing a really good job up front, even before he's in office, trying to stop the war in Ukraine, trying to de-escalate World War III, going after the corrupt FDA, going after the totally open border of the smuggled, disappeared women and children.
[01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:17.869]  I've got a bunch of just amazing clips of him in Europe.
[01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:20.170]  Very powerful information.
[01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:26.710]  A lot of other really critical medical news, economic news, and so much more.
[01:01:26.949 --> 01:01:31.550]  And on the track of stirring up racial division as the smoke screen cover...
[01:01:32.099 --> 01:01:47.219]  For civil unrest that they will then try to use to drive Trump from office and uses the cover for blue cities and states to secede and declare the Trump administration illegitimate and plunge America into civil war.
[01:01:47.599 --> 01:02:01.639]  They are using the recent ruling on Daniel Penney I'm being acquitted of manslaughter when the guy's a hero.
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:03.519]  Black folks on the train said that.
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.519]  That's what he was.
[01:02:05.739 --> 01:02:08.900]  This guy was like a psychotic, arrested hundreds of times that was attacking people.
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:13.039]  The BLM folks run by Soros are promising to burn down America.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:24.360]  So that's just a case of one guy dying in moderately questionable circumstances that have now been vetted to have been legitimate.
[01:02:27.719 --> 01:02:38.980]  And can you imagine if a hundred or more migrants or Democrats out protesting deportations that some right-wing Trump supporter, close quote, shoots and kills a bunch of them?
[01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:41.860]  Can you imagine the trigger that's going to be?
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:52.519]  I mean, if George Floyd got large swaths of the country burned down, you know, the media hyping that up, and the Democrats have said Trump's coming to kill the migrants with no evidence.
[01:02:53.639 --> 01:02:55.039]  And oh, we've got to have uprisings.
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.940]  Carville and all these Democrat governors and mayors.
[01:02:59.139 --> 01:03:00.380]  This is their move.
[01:03:00.619 --> 01:03:16.679]  A new virus, a new scare, escalated war, racial division, to then position Trump as a dictator and as a pretext for secession of Democrat-controlled areas.
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.360]  I mean, this is official news now.
[01:03:18.599 --> 01:03:21.059]  This isn't me years ago saying this is what they did.
[01:03:21.159 --> 01:03:21.719]  This isn't...
[01:03:21.719 --> 01:03:22.099]  No, no.
[01:03:23.079 --> 01:03:24.960]  And by the way, I wasn't just predicting that.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:47.960]  John Podesta said in August of 2020 in a huge article in the New York Times where the New York Times was at the big war game, a three-day war game, and they war-gamed if Trump won in 2020, how they would use racial division and other things as the trigger to say he was illegitimate before he got into office.
[01:03:49.039 --> 01:03:56.860]  As president-elect, and then they would have Western blue states and other blue states secede, and blue cities secede, and have an uprising.
[01:03:57.139 --> 01:04:01.219]  And then Carville went on TV two weeks before the election and said the same thing, and a bunch of others.
[01:04:02.239 --> 01:04:08.280]  So, do you understand that I am not up here predicting this?
[01:04:08.539 --> 01:04:09.699]  They're doing it.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.659]  Now, I don't know if the new viral scare will be successful.
[01:04:12.679 --> 01:04:13.260]  Probably won't.
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:16.880]  People are awake to it, and definitely Trump's not going to go along with it.
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:17.920]  So they got a big problem there.
[01:04:19.019 --> 01:04:21.820]  But they said it'll come crashing down on him and take control of his administration.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:22.820]  Hotez said it last week.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:31.000]  And then you've got the war, which is their going ahead with, which it looks like their main attack.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:36.519]  And then you've got this whole race-based civil war thing going.
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.980]  And there's other crap they can pull too.
[01:04:40.119 --> 01:04:42.440]  A big cyber attack, knock out half the power or more.
[01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:43.659]  Say the Russians did it.
[01:04:43.719 --> 01:04:44.579]  They've been pre-programming.
[01:04:44.659 --> 01:04:45.659]  That's going to happen with no evidence.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:50.400]  They tell you what they're going to do and they tell you who they're going to blame for it before they do it.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:05:06.599]  I mean, that's their weakness, but it's also them pre-programming it into the minds of people and also a confidence act for their own bureaucracy and their minions in government corporations and academia and media to feel confident about how they're going to win.
[01:05:07.569 --> 01:05:13.409]  Don't worry, it'll look like a red mirage, but we've got the votes, the mail-in votes, he will lose, Pelosi and all of them said.
[01:05:14.349 --> 01:05:19.369]  And others went, we're not sure, we'll just have a civil war and secede and have our own inauguration.
[01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:24.070]  And the DNC decided they were going to do that, the New York Times reported.
[01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:26.570]  I've shown the article over and over again.
[01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:31.690]  And Breitbart had a good boil-down of it with an easier-to-remember headline.
[01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:32.929]  I always forget the New York Times headline.
[01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:40.179]  The New York Times headline I showed last week was something like, I think?
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:01.619]  Why would they have the New York Times to their war game and then report on it?
[01:06:01.679 --> 01:06:07.880]  Because they want to normalize it like, yeah, he's going to be a dictator, and we're going to overthrow him, and we're going to secede, and we're going to have a civil war.
[01:06:08.139 --> 01:06:17.260]  And they make movies like Civil War showing that very scenario where a Trumpian figure gets killed, where a bunch of states get together with what's left of the U.S. military, and they go kill Trump.
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:25.460]  Now they're saying, well, the military's meeting to not follow illegal orders once it gets in, because we know he's going to kill the black people and Hispanics, and no, they're going to provide that.
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:31.019]  In the scenario, California, Oregon, and Washington then threatened to secede from the United States.
[01:06:31.119 --> 01:06:32.320]  Mr. Trump took office as planned.
[01:06:33.179 --> 01:06:34.460]  The House named Mr. Biden President.
[01:06:34.579 --> 01:06:38.159]  The Senate and the House stuck with Trump.
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:44.119]  At that point in the scenario, the nation stopped looking to the media for cues and wanted to see what the military would do.
[01:06:46.559 --> 01:06:53.800]  So, that was their old plan, and now it's their new plan because they're executing on the preparatory phases of it.
[01:06:54.949 --> 01:07:01.769]  And again, you get home after football practice, it's 5.30, you're 14 years old, and you know Mom, she cooks dinner.
[01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:07.110]  At least in my traditional, you know, I'm old enough to still have that going on.
[01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:09.469]  I'd come in, I'd need to ask Mom what was for dinner.
[01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:13.730]  I could walk right in and look what was on top of the stove and what she was doing.
[01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.929]  I'd go, oh man, chicken fried steak, great.
[01:07:16.110 --> 01:07:17.150]  You make a mashed potatoes too.
[01:07:17.269 --> 01:07:18.849]  And oh, salad, Mom, you're the best.
[01:07:19.329 --> 01:07:20.230]  Oh yeah, honey.
[01:07:20.429 --> 01:07:22.449]  And there's squash casserole in the...
[01:07:23.079 --> 01:07:23.460]  Oven.
[01:07:23.679 --> 01:07:24.719]  Man, she spoiled the hell out of us.
[01:07:24.739 --> 01:07:25.119]  What a cook.
[01:07:26.039 --> 01:07:28.000]  And I also got some rolls.
[01:07:30.039 --> 01:07:31.099]  Do me a favor, honey.
[01:07:31.219 --> 01:07:33.039]  I forgot the dog food in the back of the Land Cruiser.
[01:07:33.159 --> 01:07:34.179]  Go unload it for me.
[01:07:34.559 --> 01:07:35.579]  And clean your room.
[01:07:35.719 --> 01:07:37.000]  And then dinner will be ready in 30 minutes.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:40.039]  They got the food on the stove.
[01:07:40.599 --> 01:07:42.300]  And it's not chicken fried steak.
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:44.519]  It's not fried chicken.
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:47.519]  It's not meatloaf.
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:55.820]  It's total war with Russia, race war, bioweapon releases, globalist martial law, because they want an age of tyranny.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.219]  They want you in slavery.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.159]  They want you locked down.
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:07:58.860]  They want control.
[01:07:59.139 --> 01:08:04.320]  They want to bring in this new AI system in their own words, where you'll own nothing and be happy and eat the bugs.
[01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:07.059]  It is dystopia by design.
[01:08:09.079 --> 01:08:17.720]  So when I use the analogy of preparatory, in case you missed it, dinner is almost cooked on the stovetop.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.340]  Mama is setting the table.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.359]  And this ain't our mama.
[01:08:22.479 --> 01:08:23.119]  This is the devil.
[01:08:25.199 --> 01:08:28.600]  She's got, you know, the iced tea out.
[01:08:29.079 --> 01:08:31.239]  She's pouring the glasses of iced tea.
[01:08:37.819 --> 01:08:39.579]  She's telling us, wash our hands.
[01:08:39.779 --> 01:08:43.260]  I mean, we're up to that point right now.
[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:53.260]  And Syria, Georgia, Romania, and you know more is about to kick off.
[01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:57.960]  They're going to pull some crap, probably attack Poland and say the Russians did.
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:01.619]  They've already tried that with some missiles and the Poles shot them down before they detonated.
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.960]  So they got the tail numbers and said, no, it's Zelensky.
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:05.279]  It's also like, it doesn't matter.
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:05.960]  No, it's Russia.
[01:09:06.079 --> 01:09:06.579]  Attack, attack.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.100]  Remember that?
[01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:11.729]  Remember Biden saying we can't give him tanks and F-16s?
[01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:13.229]  That's World War III because it is.
[01:09:13.329 --> 01:09:15.789]  Because you keep escalating, keep escalating, keep escalating.
[01:09:15.869 --> 01:09:18.550]  It's not hard to predict the next move because that's all there is.
[01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:22.329]  And so the headlines, oh, Russia's in deep trouble.
[01:09:22.489 --> 01:09:24.510]  Russia's having its Saigon moment in Syria.
[01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:26.390]  Oh, Russia's getting routed.
[01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:27.409]  Oh, Russia's surrounded.
[01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:34.109]  Oh, boy, look, Romania, you know, isn't going to accept the new president that just got elected because he's anti-war with Russia.
[01:09:35.529 --> 01:09:38.869]  So Russia sees a coup in Syria.
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:45.640]  Multiple coups in Ukraine on their doorstep by NATO, and so they move in.
[01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:48.920]  Now they see another coup in Romania.
[01:09:49.239 --> 01:09:50.659]  What is Russia going to do?
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:58.060]  But even if Russia doesn't do anything, which I think they're going to be restrained, Russia knows what's going on.
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:09:59.560]  They're trying to hold until Trump gets in.
[01:10:00.619 --> 01:10:01.520]  But if...
[01:10:03.829 --> 01:10:11.350]  If Russia doesn't do anything, which I'm predicting Russia won't, the globalists will provide a false flag and say Russia did it, like blowing up the Nord Stream pipeline and saying Russia did it.
[01:10:11.409 --> 01:10:11.689]  Remember that?
[01:10:11.850 --> 01:10:13.010]  Later they had to admit the West did it.
[01:10:15.069 --> 01:10:16.229]  But that doesn't matter.
[01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:32.890]  Because Romania and its new totalitarian unelected government is already saying Russia will pay and it will now announce, according to my sources, very soon that, oh, we've had troops in Russia.
[01:10:33.829 --> 01:10:45.029]  Ukraine, which has admitted for at least a year and a half, and we're at war with Russia, and they're a NATO member, and now NATO has brought in Article 5 into it.
[01:10:45.789 --> 01:10:47.170]  I said Article 7 earlier.
[01:10:48.289 --> 01:10:51.050]  So, let's go over this.
[01:10:51.489 --> 01:10:55.630]  Then I'll get into the Middle East and why that's so serious for all the Christians getting slaughtered.
[01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:59.770]  Under the new thing that's been done.
[01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.510]  All right.
[01:11:01.479 --> 01:11:02.140]  Here it is.
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.000]  From an associate in Romania.
[01:11:04.859 --> 01:11:09.819]  And we can show this information that I was sent by a high-level source.
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:16.180]  By February 20th, the Biden administration wants to start a war involving the U.S. without the U.S. starting the war.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:21.819]  The logical sequence of events for this purpose will be as follows.
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:27.439]  Romania already has troops in Ukraine without publicly acknowledging this blatant threat.
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:33.180]  We're good to go.
[01:11:38.579 --> 01:11:39.739]  A reason is needed.
[01:11:39.939 --> 01:11:40.920]  A pretext.
[01:11:41.119 --> 01:11:45.760]  The reason is Russia's alleged involvement in the Romanian elections in a hostile manner.
[01:11:46.119 --> 01:11:57.239]  Romania will announce, obviously on U.S. orders, its involvement in the conflict alongside Ukraine in order to ostensibly defend its democracy threatened by the tainted elections.
[01:11:57.239 --> 01:11:59.000]  That's their cover for setting up a dictatorship.
[01:11:59.199 --> 01:12:00.159]  Oh, because we're in a war now.
[01:12:00.239 --> 01:12:00.779]  That's why we did it.
[01:12:01.039 --> 01:12:01.800]  Same thing with Zelensky.
[01:12:02.609 --> 01:12:09.989]  The Russians will probably retaliate violently and NATO and Biden's orders will come to Romania's aid with troops already stationed in Romania.
[01:12:10.649 --> 01:12:18.010]  The conflict becomes global through NATO's involvement and therefore the U.S. declares war on Russia.
[01:12:18.729 --> 01:12:27.989]  The Biden administration declares the establishment of a state of war and the suspension of certain democratic rights including the natural course of the outcome of the presidential elections.
[01:12:28.989 --> 01:12:36.949]  Trump will no longer be named President of the United States, and by virtue of the state of war, he will be arrested and his entire staff.
[01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:49.210]  What is happening in Romania is not only a preview of what will happen throughout Europe, but also what will happen in the USA, the establishment of a neo-fascist regime, and dictatorship of the neo-Marxists of Soros.
[01:12:49.390 --> 01:13:10.289]  Very quickly, the conflict will spread throughout the world and the USA. The bandits in Washington hope We'll thus cover the whole of thousands of trillions that has accumulated since 1972 when Nixon gave free reign the printing of dollars without gold backing.
[01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:13.750]  Yeah, very astute because the old financial order is coming to an end.
[01:13:13.949 --> 01:13:17.069]  They need a global war as the political smokescreen for that.
[01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:19.569]  And that's excellent breakdown.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.340]  I was also sent this information by the same source.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.979]  Israel's love affair with Syrian jihadists.
[01:13:28.359 --> 01:13:30.560]  Massive report on the mass murder of the Christians.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.739]  It's already happened and will accelerate now under this liberation of Syria.
[01:13:34.199 --> 01:13:35.340]  Another excellent breakdown.
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.319]  The end of pluralism in the Middle East.
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:39.500]  Showing the devil's bargain.
[01:13:42.659 --> 01:13:44.300]  With the West and Israel.
[01:13:44.579 --> 01:13:47.119]  With the Wahhabists.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.000]  With the Sunni.
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:52.000]  That is the majority of Islam against the Shiites.
[01:13:53.739 --> 01:14:00.000]  And the Christians under the obvious Saudi Arabian backs will not do well.
[01:14:00.119 --> 01:14:00.640]  They will be murdered.
[01:14:02.119 --> 01:14:04.079]  So that's the deal going on.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:25.750]  We're going to be talking more about that, but I wanted to just play for you an eight-plus-year-old political ad based in total truth and futurist analysis What would have happened potentially if Hillary Clinton would have been able to win or steal the 2016 election?
[01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:33.090]  And then I want to come out of that with a short clip from The End of the Planet of the Apes.
[01:14:33.529 --> 01:14:44.710]  We just sure hope our ancestors living in the nuclear fallout mutant zones aren't too angry with us because I guess some of us did try hard, but I guess some of us didn't try hard enough.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:57.399]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:05.619]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:08.020]  As president, I will make it clear.
[01:15:08.779 --> 01:15:13.500]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:19.340]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.479]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[01:15:22.739 --> 01:15:25.760]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:28.600]  We came, we saw, he died.
[01:15:30.850 --> 01:15:36.789]  With her, you'll end up in World War III. I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:44.890]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:58.779]  The US military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[01:15:59.159 --> 01:16:01.659]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[01:16:01.939 --> 01:16:03.779]  Of course not, because she's...
[01:16:03.779 --> 01:16:10.300]  All right, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:12.600]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:20.810]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:17:00.739 --> 01:17:01.920]  Oh, my God.
[01:17:02.739 --> 01:17:03.899]  I'm back.
[01:17:05.899 --> 01:17:07.319]  I'm home.
[01:17:08.199 --> 01:17:09.779]  All the time.
[01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:15.579]  We finally really did it.
[01:17:16.439 --> 01:17:18.619]  You maniacs!
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:21.260]  You blew it up!
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.100]  Oh, damn you!
[01:17:24.979 --> 01:17:26.100]  God!
[01:17:26.939 --> 01:17:29.060]  You all to hell!
[01:17:42.979 --> 01:17:43.880]  All right, folks.
[01:17:44.659 --> 01:17:48.840]  I'm going to conclude now most of the World War III escalation.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:54.600]  I want to come back and get into the attack on Christians and what that's looking like and what's going to come out of Assyria.
[01:17:55.619 --> 01:18:02.619]  And I also want to talk about the ongoing escalations into World War III. We'll just recap it and talk about the different scenarios that come next.
[01:18:02.819 --> 01:18:08.319]  But I do want to then talk about the positive things Trump is doing and what is unfolding there.
[01:18:08.619 --> 01:18:15.199]  The problem is that it is because Trump is so good and the whole world's waking up so fast.
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:18.960]  That the globalists are doing what they're now doing.
[01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:24.539]  And they were always planning this, but often a little bit more in the future, according to the reports I've seen.
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:26.140]  And they're on record about this.
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:28.159]  So this is a big deal.
[01:18:28.979 --> 01:18:34.859]  Please remember before we go to break that we have incredible products at our wonderful sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:18:34.899 --> 01:18:36.819]  Whatever happens to InfoWars, that's not owned by me.
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:38.359]  The bad guys have no claim on it.
[01:18:38.399 --> 01:18:44.979]  It'll be the sponsor, the big sponsor to keep us on with the new Alex Jones Network at AJNLive on X. Be sure and follow us there.
[01:18:45.119 --> 01:18:48.359]  You really want to support and get great Christmas presents and great...
[01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:56.960]  We're good to go.
[01:19:13.199 --> 01:19:14.960]  Iodine, the biggest sales of the year are there.
[01:19:15.359 --> 01:19:17.260]  30 to 40% off on top of the giant.
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:21.800]  Discounts take action now, ladies and gentlemen, at thealexchannelstore.com.
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:33.699]  My dad is chemistry background, also a retired doctor, but he came in to help me run my supplement division 13 years ago.
[01:19:34.159 --> 01:19:35.479]  The deep state sued the hell out of him.
[01:19:35.619 --> 01:19:36.920]  We're going to our guest in a moment, but I gotta do this.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:37.340]  Thank you, sir.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:41.500]  And they basically almost destroyed my parents.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.180]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family.
[01:19:45.590 --> 01:20:01.289]  We're good to go.
[01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:11.390]  Personal request I ask you to support him because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[01:20:11.569 --> 01:20:21.569]  He was giving everything to Infowars and then personally going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me because that's how dads are.
[01:20:22.069 --> 01:20:23.069]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[01:20:23.229 --> 01:20:29.350]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office and I got pissed.
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:37.100]  So, it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day, and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[01:20:37.539 --> 01:20:38.800]  The supplements are there.
[01:20:38.979 --> 01:20:39.600]  They're great.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:40.939]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:41.880]  He's put everything into it.
[01:20:41.899 --> 01:20:42.319]  He has.
[01:20:42.399 --> 01:20:42.960]  They're incredible.
[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:52.920]  I've given so much this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything, that I don't want to belabor this.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.220]  We have important topics to cover.
[01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:56.289]  Please support us.
[01:20:56.489 --> 01:20:58.510]  Go to drjonesdadgrills.com.
[01:20:58.569 --> 01:20:59.289]  There's a new sale.
[01:20:59.510 --> 01:21:00.989]  Everything is 30% off.
[01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:10.609]  Next Level Foundational Energy, All Fluoride-Free Toothpaste, Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver, CoQ10, and Corseton Max that are high-end Corseton and CoQ10 for 40% off.
[01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:13.029]  Or try these other amazing products.
[01:21:13.329 --> 01:21:17.149]  Ultimate longevity pack for 50% off a big sale.
[01:21:17.489 --> 01:21:25.050]  And my dad literally took a loan last week to be able to buy the product that's coming in finally next week.
[01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:27.329]  Turbo Force, things like that that are popular.
[01:21:27.529 --> 01:21:30.029]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[01:21:30.779 --> 01:21:34.520]  And the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.199]  My dad won't stop fighting.
[01:21:36.399 --> 01:21:36.960]  He's a fighter.
[01:21:37.079 --> 01:21:37.939]  Hell, he's my dad.
[01:21:38.079 --> 01:21:39.039]  I think I'm a fighter.
[01:21:39.279 --> 01:21:40.680]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[01:21:41.199 --> 01:21:48.880]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[01:21:49.039 --> 01:21:51.739]  But this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[01:21:51.859 --> 01:21:52.819]  It's about my parents.
[01:21:53.489 --> 01:21:58.930]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's what the enemy targeted them.
[01:21:59.390 --> 01:22:02.409]  So, please, support the Info War today.
[01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:04.510]  Support my mother and my father.
[01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:07.489]  I'm asking you personally for you to do it now.
[01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:12.250]  And if 5% of the millions watching would go do it, all our problems will be over in one minute.
[01:22:12.409 --> 01:22:17.909]  But it's less than one-half, one percent to ever buy anything from drjonesnackels.com, the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:20.710]  And for those that do support, thank you for keeping us in the fight.
[01:22:20.859 --> 01:22:23.560]  We're good to go.
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:32.920]  We're good to go.
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:36.880]  We're good to go.
[01:22:39.829 --> 01:22:40.489]  In a week.
[01:22:41.489 --> 01:22:45.810]  And then his lady called, said, oh, he's sorry, he can't make it.
[01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:46.270]  He's sick.
[01:22:46.350 --> 01:22:47.310]  And then he was dead a week later.
[01:22:48.069 --> 01:22:49.590]  So I missed out on that interview.
[01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:52.289]  Though I did get a lot of Willie Nelson interviews.
[01:22:53.329 --> 01:22:55.050]  Not bragging, it's just fun little stories.
[01:22:58.850 --> 01:23:00.270]  Out of kindness, I suppose.
[01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:03.770]  Out of kindness, I suppose.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:16.199]  It'll really be a bummer we blow up this beautiful, wonderful, fun earth with all the little doggies and horsies and birdies because we're too busy killing each other.
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:21.739]  All right, let me just finish up here with the World War III situation.
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:28.279]  Then I'll shift gears into why the globalists want that and the good things Trump's doing.
[01:23:30.609 --> 01:23:37.770]  Look, NATO has been bombing Russia trying to escalate the situation as much as they can.
[01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:40.590]  And we all know about that.
[01:23:42.329 --> 01:23:47.390]  But they're not going to be able to get away with this unless they have some pretext.
[01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:54.750]  So, are they going to bomb Poland again and blame Russia, but this time...
[01:23:56.409 --> 01:24:00.229]  The missiles don't get blown up in air, so their tails don't survive.
[01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:03.810]  And the Poles have a new government that's pro-war.
[01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:06.529]  And they say, no, it was the Russians.
[01:24:06.909 --> 01:24:08.010]  Something like that.
[01:24:08.850 --> 01:24:11.010]  That already happened almost two years ago.
[01:24:12.029 --> 01:24:13.770]  What, nine, ten months into the war?
[01:24:13.930 --> 01:24:17.829]  It'll be three years old in February, on February 24th of next year.
[01:24:20.319 --> 01:24:26.500]  Or will they do a big cyber attack and knock out a bunch of power in Europe or here or both and say the Russians did it?
[01:24:26.579 --> 01:24:28.140]  They've been pre-programming and hyping that.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:31.180]  What else will they do?
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:33.819]  Well, we should talk about that, alas, General Flynn, tomorrow.
[01:24:35.359 --> 01:24:41.180]  But that's where we are because the globalists will lose all their power if they're not able to pull this off.
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:49.359]  And you saw the date we were given from our high-level source.
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:25:00.500]  The word is they're going to get this war fully going and claim that Russia's at war with Romania, who's a part of NATO, so NATO can officially come into the war with the United States by February 20th.
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:03.239]  And you say, well, that's a month after Trump gets in.
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:09.920]  It'll take him six months, even if he does a perfect job, to get full control of the federal government.
[01:25:12.699 --> 01:25:14.979]  And I mean just to control a policy.
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:18.079]  Again, I got 50 employees or so.
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:24.520]  If they weren't all awesome and on board with what I was wanting to do, we couldn't function.
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.479]  Imagine the millions of people under Trump.
[01:25:29.739 --> 01:25:35.520]  So people expecting perfection from him, even if he was perfect, which he's not, can't do it.
[01:25:35.699 --> 01:25:36.119]  We're humans.
[01:25:37.659 --> 01:25:39.899]  So, this is where we are.
[01:25:41.199 --> 01:25:52.289]  And I can intellectually look at it, politically, militarily, spiritually look at it, and it gives me a sick feeling in my stomach.
[01:25:53.210 --> 01:25:58.770]  If you look at world history, war and conflict is the default position.
[01:25:58.770 --> 01:26:00.949]  Liberty and freedom and peace is rare.
[01:26:01.829 --> 01:26:08.350]  And we've had it so long comparatively to other societies and timelines and history, periods.
[01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:14.069]  That we do have a normalcy bias to believe that the good times are gonna go on forever, like the Cars song.
[01:26:14.289 --> 01:26:16.229]  Let the good times roll.
[01:26:17.310 --> 01:26:19.210]  Let them knock you around.
[01:26:20.789 --> 01:26:23.590]  Let them keep you up in the air.
[01:26:23.909 --> 01:26:26.489]  Let them wash your rock and roll hair.
[01:26:26.489 --> 01:26:27.930]  Let the good times roll.
[01:26:28.409 --> 01:26:31.869]  And believe me, I'd like to work five days a week, eight hours a day.
[01:26:31.869 --> 01:26:34.010]  I got lots of stuff I want to do.
[01:26:37.019 --> 01:26:50.140]  But I can't stop working seven days a week, on average, 16 hours a day, because I have a survival instinct.
[01:26:50.279 --> 01:26:51.979]  And I'm a man.
[01:26:52.239 --> 01:26:53.859]  And I have a responsibility.
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:59.020]  And 50 years ago, 100 years ago, I was just a common person.
[01:26:59.619 --> 01:27:02.880]  In this freakazoid world, I'm a weirdo.
[01:27:03.569 --> 01:27:14.130]  You know, they say in the land of the mad that the sane people are seen as crazy.
[01:27:15.609 --> 01:27:18.970]  You could also say in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
[01:27:24.850 --> 01:27:30.250]  So, Israel's now openly bragging that they helped overthrow Assad.
[01:27:31.579 --> 01:27:35.840]  Erdogan is bragging after denying it last week, and now they're dividing up the country.
[01:27:38.119 --> 01:27:40.079]  And they're not putting in nice people.
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:43.220]  I mean, I'll show you the headlines.
[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:48.600]  They are putting the former head of al-Qaeda and ISIS in the region in charge of it.
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.119]  It's all Saudi Arabia-backed.
[01:27:51.220 --> 01:28:01.470]  And that's the deal that's been made, is to help Saudi Arabia run out the Shiites, who are their arch-enemies, Out of the Middle East.
[01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:14.510]  And then as soon as the Shiites are contained or defeated, the Wahhabiists, the dominant form of Islam, almost 80% of the Muslims on Earth are in it.
[01:28:14.670 --> 01:28:15.829]  That's a billion plus people.
[01:28:16.670 --> 01:28:19.130]  They are going to turn towards us again.
[01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:23.310]  And our governments have opened the borders to them.
[01:28:24.989 --> 01:28:25.510]  So...
[01:28:29.619 --> 01:28:30.359]  There you have it.
[01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:47.619]  And with the evangelical Christians, who are nice people and good people on average, I don't think they're bad, they're always told, though, by their preacher leaders, they're literally getting talking points from the Pentagon and Israel on record, that whoever, you know, is in power anywhere in the Middle East is always the Antichrist, and it's God's will they be overturned.
[01:28:47.979 --> 01:29:00.090]  Well, how do the evangelicals that are celebrating Assad, because, you know, in Revelation, Israel's at war with Syria, And so, whoever's in there is always the devil.
[01:29:00.289 --> 01:29:03.010]  Well, you got your devil now.
[01:29:05.949 --> 01:29:14.130]  You've got your devil now because they're going to put radical jihadists, Wahhabists in control.
[01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:15.470]  I mean, they're not going to.
[01:29:15.609 --> 01:29:16.109]  They have.
[01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:26.649]  And then that new leadership will agree to give Turkey part of Syria and give Israel part of Syria.
[01:29:28.529 --> 01:29:30.350]  I guess some other countries will get a part of it.
[01:29:33.149 --> 01:29:34.829]  And that's pretty nasty.
[01:29:35.649 --> 01:29:36.409]  Big breakdown.
[01:29:36.590 --> 01:29:38.609]  Israel's love affair with Syrian jihadists.
[01:29:38.710 --> 01:29:39.430]  You should look this up.
[01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:42.149]  Big breakdown.
[01:29:42.329 --> 01:29:42.649]  There's another one.
[01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:44.350]  The end of pluralism in the Middle East.
[01:29:45.939 --> 01:29:51.840]  A truly seismic change in the Middle East appears to be happening very fast, and its heart is a devil's bargain.
[01:29:52.180 --> 01:30:08.899]  Turkey and the Gulf states accept the annihilation of the Palestinian nation, creation of the greater Israel, and return for the annihilation of the Shia minorities in Syria and Lebanon, and the imposition of Salafism across Europe.
[01:30:09.989 --> 01:30:11.210]  Eastern Arab world.
[01:30:11.489 --> 01:30:30.109]  This also spells the end of Lebanon and Syria's Christian communities as witness the tearing down of all Christian churches, the smashing of the alcohol and the forced imposition of the veil on women in Aleppo now.
[01:30:33.689 --> 01:30:44.359]  And of course you notice that the Syrian military never put up a fight.
[01:30:44.539 --> 01:30:57.720]  They'd been paid off, just like in Gulf War I and Gulf War II. So this is very sophisticated NATO-Israel-Turkish operation.
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:00.239]  I told you that a week ago.
[01:31:00.359 --> 01:31:01.340]  Oh, you don't know that.
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:03.659]  We don't know what's going on over there.
[01:31:03.739 --> 01:31:04.119]  Yeah, right.
[01:31:05.199 --> 01:31:06.199]  So there you go.
[01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:09.319]  And that's where we are.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:19.920]  And if you think this is going to be good for the average person anywhere in the world, the average Christian, the average anybody, and if you think that this isn't evil, well, I got a bridge I want to sell you.
[01:31:20.699 --> 01:31:22.859]  Or some oceanfront property in Arizona.
[01:31:23.279 --> 01:31:25.159]  And from my front porch, you can see the sea.
[01:31:26.159 --> 01:31:27.739]  And that ties into this article.
[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:30.619]  It's a good article from Gateway Pundit, you know.
[01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:38.449]  80 years ago, 70 years ago, 60 years ago, 50 years ago, you're a conspiracy theorist, but I've interviewed the Judge Advocate General that ran the trials.
[01:31:38.670 --> 01:31:49.430]  I've interviewed Admiral Moore, the former Joint Chiefs Staff Chairman, who was in there decades after, but was, you know, in the Pacific War when he was a young man, but he was involved in all of it.
[01:31:50.109 --> 01:31:54.989]  And, yeah, the U.S. and British had the purple and blue codes of the Japanese.
[01:31:55.149 --> 01:31:56.750]  They knew the exact day of the attack, what was going to happen.
[01:31:57.569 --> 01:32:04.050]  They had the aircraft carriers out on maneuvers because the battleships were basically worthless in future war.
[01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:07.729]  And they let the Japanese attack.
[01:32:07.869 --> 01:32:10.069]  Now that doesn't let the Japanese off the hook for what they did.
[01:32:10.770 --> 01:32:28.770]  The point is that Russia's being pushed in where the Japanese were and then all these other events and all the jihadists they brought into Europe and the United States and Canada They're going to be used as future triggers for attacks.
[01:32:29.109 --> 01:32:36.229]  And then when it all settles, when the dust settles, we'll have less rights and we'll be surveilled in a tyranny.
[01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:39.289]  And all the homeland security systems will be used on us, like I told you after 9-11.
[01:32:39.289 --> 01:32:39.949]  Now they are.
[01:32:40.090 --> 01:32:41.090]  It'll be even worse.
[01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:44.850]  So, there you go.
[01:32:46.449 --> 01:32:49.029]  Now, why do the globalists need all this tyranny?
[01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:52.890]  I mean, you've got, in every major European country, the Patriots winning.
[01:32:56.609 --> 01:33:00.609]  The AFD is set to probably have the chancellorship and the whole government soon.
[01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:11.409]  So their answer there is just outlaw the party because Germans don't want nuclear war and don't want communism and don't want leftist DEI and they're trying to reject it.
[01:33:11.529 --> 01:33:12.989]  So we've got all of that going on.
[01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:16.210]  But I gotta tell you, Scott Bennett...
[01:33:18.029 --> 01:33:19.369]  Was super accurate in all this.
[01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:23.109]  And I remember, we got to find the clip, months and months ago, he was on predicting they'd use Romania.
[01:33:23.329 --> 01:33:24.970]  I remember that as a trigger.
[01:33:25.170 --> 01:33:27.109]  This is part of NATO, and now that's happened.
[01:33:28.569 --> 01:33:32.569]  And the head of RT said Scott Bennett could have been killed for telling the truth.
[01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:33.949]  Yeah, I saw him a few months.
[01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:38.069]  I saw him like two days after Trump got shot, and he was fine.
[01:33:38.069 --> 01:33:41.130]  And then he just came back from Ukraine and dropped dead.
[01:33:44.449 --> 01:33:46.930]  So, one of those 24-hour cancers.
[01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:51.399]  So we need to find those clips of him talking about that.
[01:33:51.659 --> 01:33:53.420]  You can definitely find articles where he wrote about it.
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:55.760]  That'll be easier to do.
[01:33:56.739 --> 01:33:58.399]  But it's obviously a big deal.
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:00.939]  Okay, let's talk about why the globalists are so upset.
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:17.859]  If you wanted Trump to deliver, we told you from behind the scenes, we broke it three weeks ago, that Trump was having shadow detente trying to tell Zelensky, I'm going to probably be able to cut the funding through the Speaker of the House to you on the next big tranche of money you want if you don't back off.
[01:34:19.130 --> 01:34:22.770]  And if you don't, agree to a ceasefire and let's make a peace deal.
[01:34:24.090 --> 01:34:31.390]  And then Trump met with Zelensky yesterday in Paris at the Notre Dame reopening and it came out in mainstream news, showed the headline earlier, no, not doing a peace deal.
[01:34:31.670 --> 01:34:32.930]  And NATO's not doing a peace deal.
[01:34:32.989 --> 01:34:34.949]  We don't care if you cut the money off, we're going to still continue.
[01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:41.689]  And now you see them canceling the election today or yesterday in Romania.
[01:34:42.069 --> 01:34:54.470]  Oh, sorry, you're pro-Russia, which they're not even pro-Russia, they're just anti-World War III. So it's the same thing with leader after leader being shot or thrown out of office or not allowed to take office.
[01:34:55.409 --> 01:35:01.210]  And, you know, unlike the U.S. in 2020 where they just stopped the ballot box and said Trump lost.
[01:35:01.289 --> 01:35:12.289]  No, they said, yeah, you won, but you can't be yet because our intelligence group, NATO, says that we've got NATO troops here that run it and they say that you work for the Russians and so you just can't be president.
[01:35:13.789 --> 01:35:15.369]  We'll choose who the president is.
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:28.159]  So, then you got Trump saying, yeah, I'm putting RFK Jr. in as the head of Health and Human Services, and they even said they're going to criminally go after Big Pharma, not just stop these poison shots.
[01:35:29.319 --> 01:35:31.420]  And then Trump says, yeah, I'm going to free the J6ers.
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:35.479]  The whole thing was corrupt and political, and yeah, we're not going to separate the families.
[01:35:35.479 --> 01:35:39.500]  We're going to deport them all, and Yeah, I mean, you know, just hardcore.
[01:35:39.939 --> 01:35:40.880]  And it's not just talk.
[01:35:41.239 --> 01:35:43.460]  Of course, you know, when Trump says something, that's what he's doing.
[01:35:43.619 --> 01:35:46.319]  That's how people respect him if they don't agree with him.
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:50.399]  Foreign leaders is because they can actually deal with somebody that this is a deal.
[01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:55.359]  Whereas in the last 50 years, the United States government's been so corrupt, any deal it claims it goes back on.
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:57.079]  It's called double-crossing.
[01:35:58.039 --> 01:35:59.779]  So, I got a bunch of these clips.
[01:35:59.939 --> 01:36:02.199]  He did a fabulous job.
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:03.060]  This is...
[01:36:05.979 --> 01:36:10.460]  Trump on Meet the Press talking about the so-called vaccines, the poison shots here at us.
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:19.340]  Let me ask you about RFK Jr. He has obviously talked about his skepticism of vaccines.
[01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:22.319]  He's expressed opposition to childhood vaccines.
[01:36:22.539 --> 01:36:24.800]  Do you want to see childhood vaccines eliminated?
[01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:26.939]  If they're dangerous for the children.
[01:36:27.119 --> 01:36:27.960]  Look- So possibly?
[01:36:28.159 --> 01:36:36.689]  When you look at some of the problems, when you look at what's going on with disease and sickness in our country, Something's wrong.
[01:36:36.909 --> 01:36:37.850]  Are you talking about autism?
[01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:43.489]  Well, if you take a look at autism, you go back 25 years, autism was almost non-existent.
[01:36:43.630 --> 01:36:45.829]  It was, you know, one out of 100,000.
[01:36:46.289 --> 01:36:53.210]  And now it's close to one out of 100. I mean, what's happening if they can find it?
[01:36:53.310 --> 01:36:55.789]  Now, I did something the other night that was a little unusual.
[01:36:56.250 --> 01:37:00.649]  At Mar-a-Lago, I called the drug companies, the top drug companies, and I called...
[01:37:01.810 --> 01:37:05.029]  RFK Jr. and Dr. Oz and some of his people.
[01:37:05.329 --> 01:37:11.010]  And I said, let's all get together and let's figure out where we're going because we're going to do a lot of things.
[01:37:11.170 --> 01:37:16.229]  Number one, we're going to reduce prices because the middleman makes more money than the drug companies, in all fairness to the drug companies.
[01:37:16.670 --> 01:37:19.050]  There's a middleman that nobody even knows who they are.
[01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:24.930]  And you look at our drug prices, they're much higher than the prices for the same medicine, for the same stuff.
[01:37:26.579 --> 01:37:34.539]  We met, and we met for a long time, and we talked about pricing, and we talked about vaccines, you know, in terms of what happens.
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:37.520]  We talked about pesticides, we talked about everything.
[01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:41.180]  And I think a lot of good things are gonna come from him.
[01:37:41.439 --> 01:37:44.020]  And he's...
[01:37:45.329 --> 01:37:47.090]  He's not going to upset any system.
[01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:48.270]  He's not going to upset this.
[01:37:48.409 --> 01:37:51.529]  He's not looking to, you know, to reinvent the wheel totally.
[01:37:51.729 --> 01:37:56.350]  But when you look at the numbers, we really don't have a very healthy country.
[01:37:56.550 --> 01:38:03.310]  Sir, going back 25 years, studies show that there is no link between vaccines and autism.
[01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:07.550]  And yet it sounds like you are open to the possibility of him looking at getting rid of them.
[01:38:07.550 --> 01:38:08.229]  I'm open to anything.
[01:38:08.609 --> 01:38:10.149]  I think somebody has to find out.
[01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:13.170]  If you go back 25 years ago, you had very little autism.
[01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:17.609]  Now you have it Well, they say because they're better at identifying it.
[01:38:20.479 --> 01:38:26.020]  One in 100,000, and now it's one in 100. That's a pretty bad number.
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:26.920]  Childhood vaccines.
[01:38:27.239 --> 01:38:28.279]  I mean, something is going on.
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:29.380]  I don't know if it's vaccines.
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:32.300]  Maybe it's chlorine in the water, right?
[01:38:32.619 --> 01:38:34.800]  You know, people are looking at a lot of different things.
[01:38:34.939 --> 01:38:35.880]  You know, childhood vaccines.
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:37.159]  I want them to look at everything.
[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:37.579]  Everything.
[01:38:37.819 --> 01:38:42.600]  So childhood vaccines have prevented about 4 million deaths around the world every year.
[01:38:42.859 --> 01:38:43.000]  I think that's great.
[01:38:43.399 --> 01:38:43.859]  Pure crap.
[01:38:44.079 --> 01:38:44.420]  I'm all for it.
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:44.979]  I think it's great.
[01:38:45.039 --> 01:38:45.319]  Hey, look.
[01:38:45.399 --> 01:38:46.579]  I'm not against vaccines.
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.420]  The polio vaccine is the greatest thing.
[01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:52.920]  If somebody told me get rid of the polio vaccine, they're gonna have to work real hard to convince me.
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:58.159]  I think vaccines are, certain vaccines are incredible.
[01:38:59.609 --> 01:39:00.850]  But maybe some aren't.
[01:39:01.029 --> 01:39:02.729]  And if they aren't, we have to find out.
[01:39:02.930 --> 01:39:11.090]  But when you talk about autism, because it was brought up, and you look at the amount we have today versus 20 or 25 years ago, it's pretty scary.
[01:39:11.369 --> 01:39:15.550]  Well, again, scientists say that's because they've gotten better at identifying it, and there's no link in studies.
[01:39:15.949 --> 01:39:22.310]  But the drug companies are going to be working with RFK Jr., and he's been an interesting guy to me.
[01:39:22.710 --> 01:39:27.310]  I've watched him for 25 years, and he's been an interesting guy.
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:30.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, everything she said is pure crap.
[01:39:31.439 --> 01:39:38.220]  They've put out a few fake studies that later got overturned, literally withdrawn, the one in England, saying no causal connection.
[01:39:38.899 --> 01:39:40.579]  And it's not 1 in 100,000.
[01:39:40.739 --> 01:39:45.100]  It was in 1970. You can look this up.
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:50.439]  It was 1 in 54,300 or something.
[01:39:50.539 --> 01:39:51.319]  I remember the exact number.
[01:39:51.460 --> 01:39:52.359]  It was 54,000.
[01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:56.119]  And now it's 1 in...
[01:39:58.029 --> 01:39:59.149]  42 kids.
[01:40:00.130 --> 01:40:03.850]  It's 1 in 21 in South Korea.
[01:40:04.010 --> 01:40:04.449]  They're the worst.
[01:40:04.670 --> 01:40:05.310]  We're second.
[01:40:06.130 --> 01:40:13.689]  And they're estimating by the year 2030, it'll be 1 in 3. And yeah, some get overdiagnosed.
[01:40:13.909 --> 01:40:15.729]  And Trump's really astute here.
[01:40:15.890 --> 01:40:22.189]  It's not just the shots that cause a viral infection because there's live viruses in these shots.
[01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:26.149]  That's in the real studies under electron microscopes.
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:28.239]  They didn't even know the viruses.
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.840]  And some attack the heart.
[01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:30.840]  That's myocarditis.
[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:34.720]  Myocarditis naturally is caused by viruses too, but also synthetic ones.
[01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:43.220]  And then a lot of the stuff in the brain is viral attacks in the baby's brain from the shots that are, quote, contaminated with SV40 and others.
[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:44.460]  They put them in there on purpose.
[01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:50.159]  Not even in the manufacturing process of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 shot, and they're all in there because they put them in.
[01:40:52.270 --> 01:40:54.970]  And I've done a whole bunch of shows on that, shown you the research papers.
[01:40:55.069 --> 01:40:56.229]  Dr. McCullough just put one out.
[01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:58.149]  Dr. Mikevitz on last week.
[01:40:59.010 --> 01:41:00.210]  She worked on all this.
[01:41:01.229 --> 01:41:02.609]  But notice he said the chlorine.
[01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:03.989]  Well, yeah, chlorine's not good either.
[01:41:06.190 --> 01:41:08.289]  It's great for your pool, but it's cancer-causing.
[01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:09.550]  But no, it's the fluoride.
[01:41:09.710 --> 01:41:14.630]  And the FDA came out this year, six months ago, and said, yeah, it causes cancer and brain damage and infertility.
[01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:15.930]  I have articles right here in my stack.
[01:41:16.210 --> 01:41:17.710]  We're almost out of time, so I'll cover it tomorrow.
[01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:18.390]  I'm going to get more into this.
[01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:22.630]  Oh my God, the live expectancy is dropping all over the Western world for the first time since ever.
[01:41:24.529 --> 01:41:25.529]  Sperm counts plummeting.
[01:41:25.649 --> 01:41:26.369]  All cancer.
[01:41:26.489 --> 01:41:30.630]  I mean, they admit in all the studies the so-called COVID shots are causing all the new heart attacks and garbage.
[01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:33.449]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:38.369]  One in 36. And I was saying 40-something.
[01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:40.350]  That number's a year old.
[01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:43.010]  So maybe my number's two years old.
[01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:48.750]  I mean, that's one in 44. By the time I looked at it, you can argue it's in the low 40s.
[01:41:49.029 --> 01:41:56.350]  Some estimates are one in 36. But the point is, is it's trending by 2030 to be one in three.
[01:41:56.590 --> 01:41:57.170]  Look that up.
[01:41:57.970 --> 01:42:00.869]  So, see, the crew didn't always say that.
[01:42:00.930 --> 01:42:02.130]  I'm not making any of this up.
[01:42:02.170 --> 01:42:03.329]  I know what I'm talking about, folks.
[01:42:03.869 --> 01:42:05.569]  Anything I say, just type it in and you pull it up.
[01:42:06.479 --> 01:42:10.979]  And that's, by the way, from the CDC and the FDA and the American Medical Association.
[01:42:10.979 --> 01:42:11.859]  It's probably worse.
[01:42:12.079 --> 01:42:13.180]  But it's a cocktail.
[01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:14.119]  It's the fluoride.
[01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:14.739]  It's the chlorine.
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:15.600]  It's the pesticides.
[01:42:16.739 --> 01:42:19.720]  It's the shots.
[01:42:20.159 --> 01:42:24.300]  It's the GMO. It's the 5G. I mean, it's just we are being bombarded.
[01:42:26.359 --> 01:42:29.020]  Here is Trump on the J6ers.
[01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:31.550]  I'm gonna look at everything.
[01:42:31.789 --> 01:42:33.270]  We're gonna look at individual cases, yeah.
[01:42:33.489 --> 01:42:33.630]  Okay.
[01:42:33.810 --> 01:42:36.489]  But I'm gonna be acting very quickly.
[01:42:37.369 --> 01:42:39.850]  Within your first 100 days, first day?
[01:42:39.989 --> 01:42:40.510]  First day.
[01:42:40.850 --> 01:42:41.449]  First day?
[01:42:41.609 --> 01:42:42.710]  Yeah, I'm looking first day.
[01:42:42.729 --> 01:42:43.569]  You've issued these pardons.
[01:42:43.689 --> 01:42:45.050]  These people have been there, how long is it?
[01:42:45.090 --> 01:42:45.909]  Three or four years?
[01:42:46.949 --> 01:42:56.750]  You know, by the way, they've been in there for years, and they're in a filthy, disgusting place that shouldn't even be allowed to be open.
[01:42:58.420 --> 01:43:04.760]  Now, here is Trump on, don't worry, we're not gonna separate kids from their families.
[01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:13.960]  Well, I don't wanna be breaking up families, so the only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back.
[01:43:14.159 --> 01:43:18.300]  Is there a way to carry out mass deportation without separating families?
[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:20.439]  Of course there is.
[01:43:22.279 --> 01:43:23.720]  Families can be deported together.
[01:43:24.939 --> 01:43:30.649]  Now, Here she is saying Trump's trying to divide the country and it's the complete opposite.
[01:43:30.829 --> 01:43:31.390]  Trump nails her.
[01:43:32.729 --> 01:43:34.970]  Sir, I don't have to tell you this because you've talked about it.
[01:43:35.010 --> 01:43:37.949]  It comes at a time when the country is deeply divided.
[01:43:39.569 --> 01:43:43.210]  And now you're gonna be leading this country for the next four years.
[01:43:43.489 --> 01:43:51.170]  For the sake of unifying this country, will you concede the 2020 election and turn the page on that chapter?
[01:43:51.369 --> 01:43:51.529]  No.
[01:43:52.369 --> 01:43:52.710]  No.
[01:43:52.850 --> 01:43:53.630]  Why would I do that?
[01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:58.060]  But let me just tell you, when you say the country is deeply divided, I'm not the president.
[01:43:58.619 --> 01:43:59.840]  Joe Biden's the president.
[01:43:59.859 --> 01:44:00.880]  But you're gonna be the president.
[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:01.220]  No, no.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.020]  I'm not the president.
[01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:05.460]  So when you say it's deeply divided, I agree.
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:07.640]  But Biden's the president, I'm not.
[01:44:08.250 --> 01:44:09.529]  And he has been a divider.
[01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:13.590]  And you know where he divided it more than anything else and it probably backfired on him?
[01:44:13.670 --> 01:44:16.229]  I think definitely is weaponization.
[01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:20.090]  When he weaponized the Justice Department and he went after his political opponent, me.
[01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:24.210]  He went after his political opponent violently because he knew he couldn't beat him.
[01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:29.590]  And I think it really was a bad thing and it really divided our country.
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:32.180]  Sir, Democrats have control of the White House now.
[01:44:32.319 --> 01:44:40.199]  They didn't in 2020. If they're going around stealing elections- When you say Democrats have control now- Of the White House.
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:40.420]  Yeah.
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:42.579]  So why didn't they steal this election?
[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.079]  Since they have more power now.
[01:44:45.340 --> 01:44:46.800]  Because I think it was too big to rig.
[01:44:50.470 --> 01:44:51.569]  It's too big to Rick.
[01:44:52.369 --> 01:45:02.750]  To the people who say that you're now directing your Justice Department to investigate 2020 and they want to move on, is that a good use of precious resources?
[01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:04.189]  Is that what you want them to do?
[01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.789]  Just so you know.
[01:45:04.939 --> 01:45:07.279]  I have the right to do that, but I'm not interested in that.
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:09.020]  You're not gonna do that?
[01:45:09.079 --> 01:45:09.619]  I'm not interested.
[01:45:09.699 --> 01:45:10.760]  I have the absolute right.
[01:45:10.939 --> 01:45:12.640]  I'm the chief law enforcement officer.
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:13.460]  You do know that.
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:14.319]  I'm the president.
[01:45:14.739 --> 01:45:16.079]  But I'm not interested in that.
[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:17.420]  You know what I'm interested in?
[01:45:17.979 --> 01:45:23.699]  Drilling and getting prices down and stopping people from pouring into our border that come from prisons and mental institutions.
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:25.239]  Absolutely.
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:26.239]  Very powerful.
