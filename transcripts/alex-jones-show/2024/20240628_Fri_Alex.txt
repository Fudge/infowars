[00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:06.926]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:08.187 --> 00:00:12.550]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and support the InfoWars.
[00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:19.776]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, June 28th, 2024.
[00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:27.302]  We're going to have live post-debate coverage of the debate of the century with Jack Posobiec and more in studio.
[00:00:27.342 --> 00:00:28.764]  Stay with us, my friends.
[00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:30.987]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.196]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:32.317 --> 00:00:34.317]  today.
[00:00:34.317 --> 00:01:03.317]   I'm going to do a little bit of a more intense, more intense.
[00:01:03.317 --> 00:01:10.317]  [Music]
[00:01:10.317 --> 00:01:25.317]  [Music]
[00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:31.317]   While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:01:31.317 --> 00:01:35.317]  [Music]
[00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:36.491]  Both salaries.
[00:01:37.172 --> 00:01:57.498]   Making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with the COVID, excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with, look, if We finally beat Medicare.
[00:01:57.838 --> 00:02:01.081]  We're trying to find housing for black Americans.
[00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:14.114]   The impact of the choice, the idea that they're gonna, I'm not, I've been proposing that everybody, they pay, The millionaires pay 1%, 1%.
[00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:20.597]  So no one after, I've not raised the cost of Social Security for anybody.
[00:02:21.037 --> 00:02:25.259]  I got my handicap when I was Vice President down to a six.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:39.245]   And once you get away with it, you get rid of the ability of Medicare to, for the ability, Us to be able to negotiate drug prices with the big pharma companies.
[00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:41.426]  What I'm going to do is fix the tax system.
[00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:45.128]  For example, we have a thousand trillionaires in America.
[00:02:45.148 --> 00:02:46.488]  I mean billionaires in America.
[00:02:46.508 --> 00:02:47.229]  No one was hurt.
[00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:50.270]  No one Israeli was accidentally killed.
[00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.251]  And it stopped.
[00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:58.811]   And I'm going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the total initiative
[00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:03.931]   relative to what we're going to do with more border patrol and more asylum officers.
[00:03:03.931 --> 00:03:23.931]  [Music]
[00:03:23.931 --> 00:03:31.931]   All right, something historic and seismic happened last night, Friday, June 27th.
[00:03:32.422 --> 00:03:43.886]  It is now Friday, June 28th, but Thursday, June 27th, was so incredibly historic on so many fronts, my mind is just blown.
[00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:50.228]  There are so many levels to this, but Jack Posobiec hadn't even slept.
[00:03:50.668 --> 00:03:52.989]  He was on air until two in the morning.
[00:03:53.837 --> 00:03:55.478]  And then flew down here from DC.
[00:03:56.499 --> 00:04:02.024]  He had, on one stream alone, twelve and a half million viewers.
[00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:05.887]  We had on our streams, all total, about four million.
[00:04:06.187 --> 00:04:07.048]  We're not in a competition.
[00:04:07.108 --> 00:04:08.429]  In fact, I just love this.
[00:04:10.671 --> 00:04:11.672]  Elon Musk didn't tweet it.
[00:04:12.172 --> 00:04:12.592]  None of that.
[00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:17.016]  Twelve and a half million views.
[00:04:18.778 --> 00:04:22.661]  And he'll be close to me in hour two, three, and four today.
[00:04:24.437 --> 00:04:28.279]  Roger Stone's coming up and you say, okay, well, that's important, but why are you raising that first?
[00:04:28.299 --> 00:04:30.100]  It just shows how dead Legacy Media is.
[00:04:30.781 --> 00:04:35.483]  Now they tried to bully X and not letting us have commentary or cover it, but we still did it.
[00:04:35.563 --> 00:04:36.023]  Fair use.
[00:04:37.484 --> 00:04:38.905]  But that's not the issue.
[00:04:38.925 --> 00:04:47.770]  I've just brought up the fact that Jack had those record numbers for a live stream there on X and his analysis of Charlie Kirk, co-host.
[00:04:50.055 --> 00:04:59.982]  The big warning is Biden, the demon, came out whenever he would talk about nuclear war with Russia and invoking Article 5 in NATO, meaning striking Russia.
[00:05:00.923 --> 00:05:03.084]  So that's the big problem in all of this.
[00:05:03.365 --> 00:05:11.170]  There's a lot of other good news, obviously, but this was just an epic slaughter and the gaslighting blew up in their face spectacularly.
[00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.751]  We just blew up the Death Star.
[00:05:13.592 --> 00:05:14.893]  It's Friday, June 28th, 2024.
[00:05:17.114 --> 00:05:29.126]  Last night, on the evening of June 27th, you saw the complete and total House of Cards come down to its stinking, satanic foundations.
[00:05:29.806 --> 00:05:36.973]  We have successfully, not just here but globally, broken the back of the New World Order.
[00:05:37.113 --> 00:05:39.796]  Our enemies are being routed en masse.
[00:05:42.267 --> 00:05:48.389]  The problem is, the only time the demon came out that runs Joe Biden was when he talked about Article 5.
[00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.391]  And getting NATO into a war with Russia, and that means total thermonuclear war.
[00:05:53.671 --> 00:05:54.712]  That's the alliance.
[00:05:55.392 --> 00:06:00.354]  If any alliance is struck, which they're putting NATO troops in publicly, then they attack Russia publicly.
[00:06:01.414 --> 00:06:03.355]  And so Biden got very animated.
[00:06:04.015 --> 00:06:05.176]  Biden wants World War III.
[00:06:05.436 --> 00:06:11.378]   The great Jack Pacific will be joining me live in studio today to discuss The potentially world-ending developments.
[00:06:11.418 --> 00:06:19.580]  Let's play a short clip of this, because while we're all celebrating, they've got the ace in the hole that is thermal nuclear war.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.201]  And if you don't think they'll play it, well, you're a fool.
[00:06:23.861 --> 00:06:25.102]  So we'll discuss how we stop them.
[00:06:25.122 --> 00:06:26.282]  We'll also look at all the good news.
[00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:29.943]  But first, let's always put the main problem up front.
[00:06:30.363 --> 00:06:40.477]   Instead of running around celebrating like a bunch of drunken sailors, We have to understand we have blown up the Death Star, in a Star Wars analogy, but the Imperial Fleet's still out there.
[00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:59.014]  But this was their entire gaslighting that Biden is invincible and he's the smartest person in the world, you know about those compilations, you've seen the establishment saying it, gaslighting, lying to you, and that all these clips are out of context where he's bumbling and babbling and doesn't know who he is.
[00:06:59.977 --> 00:07:03.680]  Disappears for a week, resting, obviously getting blood transfusions.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.721]  That's what these globalists do.
[00:07:05.542 --> 00:07:08.244]  He was all plumped up, looked like he gained 10 pounds.
[00:07:08.684 --> 00:07:09.605]  That's blood, folks.
[00:07:10.366 --> 00:07:11.687]  That's what Lance Armstrong would do.
[00:07:13.468 --> 00:07:17.271]  And that's the tactic that the Royals do and all of them do.
[00:07:17.311 --> 00:07:18.632]  There's big corporate businesses doing that.
[00:07:18.672 --> 00:07:20.754]  I can just look at him and tell you he gained 10 pounds.
[00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:21.155]  That's blood.
[00:07:22.057 --> 00:07:27.041]  So that's one way to get old people to kind of get out of dementia for a little while, is blood.
[00:07:28.082 --> 00:07:32.606]  But you can see his arteries all bulging out of the sides, the veins all bulging out of the sides of his head.
[00:07:33.107 --> 00:07:36.870]  He was obviously on a lot of Adderall and other cocktails.
[00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:41.915]  But it didn't matter because he is a broken, pedophilic vessel.
[00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:46.759]  Then he starts saying we gotta have late-term abortion because families are having sex with their daughters.
[00:07:47.914 --> 00:07:48.695]  Whoa!
[00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:50.116]  I mean, yeah, we know, Joe.
[00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:55.039]  We know about your daughter's now confirmed diary that you're raping her in the shower when she's a little girl.
[00:07:55.719 --> 00:07:57.640]  I mean, this was just wild.
[00:08:00.022 --> 00:08:06.006]  And there they are trying to tell us he's a superhero, and then Trump just calmly eviscerated him.
[00:08:06.806 --> 00:08:11.329]  But here's the big problem up front, and then Jack will be with us in the second, third, and fourth hour today.
[00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.031]  In fact, he's hosting the fourth hour.
[00:08:15.012 --> 00:08:20.137]  I've got legal meetings I've got to go to behind the scenes to keep the ship going, this operation going.
[00:08:20.177 --> 00:08:21.439]  That's an ongoing daily fight.
[00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:25.803]  So pray, pray for info wars, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:26.204 --> 00:08:36.834]  But here's a short clip of him salivating about how he's going to escalate a war and then suddenly you see the eyes open wide like a great white shark and the demon is looking out at you.
[00:08:36.874 --> 00:08:37.255]  Here it is.
[00:08:38.536 --> 00:08:39.297]  Just do what you want.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:40.981]  There's a thing called Article 5.
[00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:43.723]  An attack on one is an attack on all.
[00:08:44.083 --> 00:08:45.204]  A required response.
[00:08:45.764 --> 00:08:46.525]  The idea.
[00:08:46.925 --> 00:08:47.586]  The idea.
[00:08:48.026 --> 00:08:51.909]  I can't think of a single major leader... It just goes on and on.
[00:08:51.929 --> 00:08:53.790]  You know, let's play the full Article 5 clip.
[00:08:55.692 --> 00:08:56.112]  Right now.
[00:08:56.633 --> 00:08:57.914]  Let's play the 2 minute, 26 second clip.
[00:08:57.934 --> 00:08:59.215]  Because this is a big deal.
[00:08:59.275 --> 00:08:59.615]  Here it is.
[00:09:00.561 --> 00:09:05.963]  As far as Israel and Hamas, Israel's the one that wants to go.
[00:09:05.983 --> 00:09:08.284]  He said the only one who wants to keep going is Hamas.
[00:09:08.644 --> 00:09:09.865]  Actually, Israel is the one.
[00:09:10.085 --> 00:09:12.226]  And you should let him go and let him finish the job.
[00:09:12.466 --> 00:09:13.206]  He doesn't want to do it.
[00:09:13.246 --> 00:09:14.787]  He's become like a Palestinian.
[00:09:15.327 --> 00:09:17.808]  But they don't like him because he's a very bad Palestinian.
[00:09:17.848 --> 00:09:18.568]  He's a weak one.
[00:09:19.929 --> 00:09:21.089]  President Biden, you have a minute.
[00:09:21.489 --> 00:09:22.890]  I've never heard so much foolishness.
[00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.051]  This is a guy who wants to get out of NATO.
[00:09:25.071 --> 00:09:26.051]  Are you going to stay in NATO?
[00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:27.692]  He's going to pull out of NATO.
[00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:32.169]  The idea that we have, our strength lies in our alliances as well.
[00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:42.093]  It may be a big ocean, but if we're able to avoid a war in Europe, a major war in Europe, what happens if in fact you have Putin continue to go into NATO?
[00:09:42.413 --> 00:09:45.534]  We have an Article 5 agreement, attack on one is attack on all.
[00:09:45.914 --> 00:09:54.117]  You want to start the nuclear war he keeps talking about, go ahead, let Putin go in and control Ukraine and then move on to Poland and other places.
[00:09:54.837 --> 00:09:55.818]  This is what happens then.
[00:09:56.258 --> 00:09:58.100]  He has no idea what the hell he's talking about.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:11.051]  And by the way, I got 50 other nations around the world to support Ukraine, including Japan and South Korea, because they understand that this kind of dislocation has a serious threat to the whole world peace.
[00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:15.255]  No major war in Europe has ever been able to be contained just to Europe.
[00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:17.937]  President Trump, just to follow up.
[00:10:18.539 --> 00:10:23.525]  Would you support the creation of an independent Palestinian state in order to achieve peace in the region?
[00:10:23.785 --> 00:10:28.751]  I'd have to see, but before we do that, the problem we have is that we spend all the money.
[00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:30.413]  So they kill us on trade.
[00:10:30.453 --> 00:10:33.136]  I made great trade deals with the European nations.
[00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:40.300]  Because if you add them up, they're about the same size economically, their economy is about the same size as the United States.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:47.930]  And they were written, no cars, no, they don't want anything that we have, but we're supposed to take their cars, their food, their everything, their agriculture.
[00:10:48.671 --> 00:10:49.352]  I changed that.
[00:10:49.953 --> 00:10:51.795]  But the big thing I changed is they don't want to pay.
[00:10:51.815 --> 00:10:59.402]  And the only reason that he can play games with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:10:59.482 --> 00:11:04.567]  I said, and he's right about this, I said, no, I'm not going to support NATO if you don't pay.
[00:11:05.225 --> 00:11:06.286]  They asked me that question.
[00:11:06.326 --> 00:11:08.007]  Would you guard us against Russia?
[00:11:08.548 --> 00:11:13.852]  At a very secret meeting of the 28 states at that time, nations at that time.
[00:11:14.152 --> 00:11:16.694]  And they said, no, if you don't pay, I won't do that.
[00:11:16.774 --> 00:11:17.535]  And you know what happened?
[00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:22.198]  Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next month.
[00:11:23.199 --> 00:11:24.960]  But now we're in the same position.
[00:11:25.161 --> 00:11:26.522]  We're paying everybody's bills.
[00:11:29.554 --> 00:11:36.358]  Jack Posobiec is really a serious expert on geopolitical matters in Eastern Europe, China, you name it.
[00:11:37.039 --> 00:11:42.142]  And he's been calling it for over a year that up against the election, they're going to try to accelerate the full war with Russia.
[00:11:43.243 --> 00:11:46.765]  So there's a lot of good news here, but the deep state is not going to give up.
[00:11:47.726 --> 00:11:52.028]  That said, radio listeners need to go to Real Alex Jones and see this video we just posted an hour ago.
[00:11:52.068 --> 00:11:52.809]  It's already gone viral.
[00:11:55.129 --> 00:11:57.090]  CNN cut to a wide shot, but we zoomed in.
[00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:05.252]  Trump walks off, goes to the backstage like any normal person does, and Biden just wanders off and Jill has to help him down the stairs.
[00:12:05.792 --> 00:12:08.573]  Little bitty tiny four inch stairs, four inch tall stairs.
[00:12:08.613 --> 00:12:12.734]  He can barely get down that and then just wanders around like a lost puppy with a lobotomy.
[00:12:13.655 --> 00:12:15.415]  This is such a powerful video.
[00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.996]  Again, it's a real Alex Jones, about 10 posts down.
[00:12:19.156 --> 00:12:21.337]  Shocking ending to the Trump versus Biden debate.
[00:12:21.657 --> 00:12:22.818]  What most people didn't see.
[00:12:23.317 --> 00:12:37.317]   here it is [music]
[00:12:37.317 --> 00:12:44.317]  [music]
[00:12:44.317 --> 00:12:51.317]  [music]
[00:12:51.317 --> 00:12:58.317]  [music]
[00:12:58.317 --> 00:13:05.317]  [music]
[00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:12.317]  [music]
[00:13:12.317 --> 00:13:15.317]  [music]
[00:13:15.317 --> 00:13:18.317]  [music]
[00:13:18.317 --> 00:13:25.317]  [music]
[00:13:25.317 --> 00:13:26.317]  [music]
[00:13:26.317 --> 00:13:27.317]  [music]
[00:13:27.965 --> 00:13:31.247]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:32.948 --> 00:13:53.622]  We need to start drilling into all this news, but you need to understand the globalist, or the corporate ruling class, the psychological warfare, tax-free foundations, so the same tactics used in New Zealand, Australia, Western Europe, Canada, the United States, are being used against the people of the planet.
[00:13:55.014 --> 00:13:56.836]  The very same tactics are being used.
[00:13:56.996 --> 00:14:10.368]  So, Macron threatens civil war in France if he is not re-elected.
[00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:13.651]  Widely unpopular.
[00:14:14.692 --> 00:14:16.293]  Macron, less than 20% support.
[00:14:16.313 --> 00:14:18.115]  His party has 50%.
[00:14:19.756 --> 00:14:20.837]  Now the Nationalists are over 30.
[00:14:22.332 --> 00:14:24.933]  Remember, it's parliamentary, so it's not two parties.
[00:14:25.853 --> 00:14:28.274]  Like in Canada, the Conservatives are like 43% now.
[00:14:29.574 --> 00:14:33.735]  Trudeau's at 14, but he still stays in power because of coalitions of the other parties.
[00:14:33.975 --> 00:14:36.516]  There's dozens of them.
[00:14:36.556 --> 00:14:41.357]  So wildly unpopular Macron threatens civil war in France if he loses upcoming snap election.
[00:14:43.437 --> 00:14:44.018]  In their parliament.
[00:14:44.358 --> 00:14:45.258]  In their legislature.
[00:14:46.485 --> 00:14:53.529]  Now, CIA, former CIA director under Bush says today's Republican Party is, quote, more nihilistic and dangerous than terror groups.
[00:14:54.169 --> 00:14:55.069]  That's Lennon Independent.
[00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.270]  Here's Newsweek.
[00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.591]  GOP is most dangerous political force in the world.
[00:14:59.011 --> 00:15:01.893]  Michael, piece of garbage, Hayden says.
[00:15:03.173 --> 00:15:04.434]  Also former head of the NSA.
[00:15:06.055 --> 00:15:08.176]  So they're telling you the quiet part out loud.
[00:15:08.196 --> 00:15:09.597]  That's why they're building all the FEMA camps.
[00:15:09.757 --> 00:15:10.837]  Beefing up was already there.
[00:15:11.738 --> 00:15:13.198]  Got a big whistleblower coming on on Monday.
[00:15:13.258 --> 00:15:14.019]  Already had one on yesterday.
[00:15:14.944 --> 00:15:16.825]  All they've got left is total tyranny.
[00:15:18.685 --> 00:15:30.729]  So just like Winston Churchill at the start of World War II, after the British forces were driven into the sea at Dunkirk, that famous speech said, all I can offer you is pain and suffering and blood and a long war.
[00:15:32.802 --> 00:15:34.864]  But in the end, you won't be slaves, we will prevail.
[00:15:35.304 --> 00:15:55.079]  I'm not gonna sit here and butter you up and say, oh, everything's fine, but we have the initiative, we're winning, we've turned the tide, but the enemy is going to strike back, and all I can promise you is blood, sweat, and pain, but victory in the end, which is way better than total slavery, with this pedophilic, devil-worshipping group.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.723]  But that's how I'm so cheerful in their persecution of me.
[00:16:01.218 --> 00:16:03.580]  I looked for a fight 30 years ago.
[00:16:05.241 --> 00:16:15.888]  We've changed the world together, and whatever happens to me is worth it because somebody has got to stand up for the children of our future, and my ancestors did it, and your ancestors did it, and by God, we're doing it again right now.
[00:16:15.948 --> 00:16:18.870]  We're bringing back manhood and honor and will.
[00:16:19.891 --> 00:16:27.516]  It is a distinct pleasure to stand up against this enemy and to be attacked.
[00:16:27.576 --> 00:16:28.356]  And I'm not a sadist.
[00:16:28.436 --> 00:16:29.117]  I'm not into pain.
[00:16:31.121 --> 00:16:32.402]  I'm not into giving people pain.
[00:16:32.802 --> 00:16:33.843]  I'm not a sadomasochist.
[00:16:33.863 --> 00:16:34.624]  I like pleasure.
[00:16:35.784 --> 00:16:44.571]  But the pleasure of liberty and freedom and truth is a trillion times better than the submission and playing along like I'm part of the system.
[00:16:44.971 --> 00:16:47.433]  I am so blessed here in the great fourth turning.
[00:16:49.995 --> 00:16:53.818]  This great turning to be with you, to know you.
[00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:05.637]  It brings tears to my eyes when I'm in a grocery store or at a hotel or airport and beautiful black families come over, beautiful white families, Hispanic families, Asian families.
[00:17:05.657 --> 00:17:07.839]  They have such love in their eyes, such light in their eyes.
[00:17:08.399 --> 00:17:09.040]  They love liberty.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.682]  They're thanking me for standing up, for fighting, for not backing down.
[00:17:12.042 --> 00:17:13.143]  And I get tears in my eyes.
[00:17:14.003 --> 00:17:20.769]  And that's why I know there's an anti-white agenda, and it's terrible, and whites should stand up and be proud of ourselves and Western civilization, and that's good.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:36.552]  But just because the enemy wants to play us off against each other racially, I can't sit there and then hate these brown and black people because they got red blood, and they got a spirit, and God made them, and they've got a lot of great contributions they've made, and we're gonna empower each other.
[00:17:37.873 --> 00:17:41.656]  That doesn't mean we'll be guilted into giving up our rights, the name of lovey-dovey and all this, that's a lie.
[00:17:41.956 --> 00:17:51.399]   But the real love that Christ brought, and that's why I reject the huge swing Against all this anti-white stuff.
[00:17:51.479 --> 00:17:54.460]  It's good to swing against it, but you've got to know why you're swinging against it.
[00:17:55.601 --> 00:17:58.242]  Because the enemy wants to divide and conquer us, because that's how they control us.
[00:17:59.182 --> 00:18:11.588]  It's good to reject the demonization and explain what's happening at the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center, but at the same time, I can't sit there and look into the eyes of these beautiful black people and these beautiful Hispanics and beautiful Asians.
[00:18:12.654 --> 00:18:13.895]  And sit there.
[00:18:14.775 --> 00:18:16.277]  And I know the globalists are hunting whites.
[00:18:16.337 --> 00:18:17.477]  I know they want to destroy the West.
[00:18:17.778 --> 00:18:23.301]  Because it's such a pillar of liberty and freedom and renaissance, that if it succeeds, the whole world will aspire to it.
[00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:30.126]  But we've got to have a ladder up to people, as Trump has said, not sit there and whack people on the head as they try to climb up the ladder.
[00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:33.732]  We're just becoming the New World Order at that point who wants to kill us all.
[00:18:33.932 --> 00:18:37.754]  They want to kill not just people they think aren't as smart or aren't as good.
[00:18:38.154 --> 00:18:38.934]  They sell that.
[00:18:39.154 --> 00:18:41.315]  They want to get rid of the people that are the smartest.
[00:18:41.395 --> 00:18:49.839]  In a real social Darwinistic system, the so-called elites, inbred, degenerate, out of control, go after the best people.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.441]  So, they're coming after all of us.
[00:18:56.024 --> 00:18:58.426]  And yes, I'm proud to be an Anglo-Saxon.
[00:18:59.266 --> 00:19:00.808]  I am proud of my ancestors.
[00:19:00.828 --> 00:19:01.968]  They did incredible things.
[00:19:02.289 --> 00:19:03.530]  But I don't live off their laurels.
[00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.672]  And I never get into my ancestors that much, but it's illustrious.
[00:19:07.032 --> 00:19:08.233]  Ridiculous on both sides.
[00:19:08.613 --> 00:19:11.736]  And the genetics flow through me, and the talents flow through me of my ancestors.
[00:19:11.756 --> 00:19:13.517]  I want them to flow through my children into the future.
[00:19:14.585 --> 00:19:16.106]  And I am proud to be a white person.
[00:19:16.146 --> 00:19:17.207]  I'm proud of white people.
[00:19:17.247 --> 00:19:18.548]  I'm proud of Western civilization.
[00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.169]  And I will not be ashamed of that.
[00:19:20.189 --> 00:19:21.010]  And I will promote that.
[00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:34.440]  But I will also not sit there and be on the counterside of the globalist Hegelian dialectic of balkanization and destruction.
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.861]  And I'm done ranting about that.
[00:19:36.881 --> 00:19:40.124]  It's just people ask me, you know, why do I have my views?
[00:19:40.464 --> 00:19:42.726]  Or, you know, where am I really going with this?
[00:19:44.138 --> 00:19:59.662]  President Trump, forever at his golf courses and hotels, has hired people from all over the world, and he finds they're hardworking, and they're smart, and they're dutiful, and they're loyal, and they're black, and they're white, and they're brown, and he doesn't care what color they are as long as they kick ass.
[00:20:00.302 --> 00:20:08.884]  And I am exactly the same as President Trump, and I think the fact that he has that view is why they hate him so much, because he likes people.
[00:20:10.379 --> 00:20:11.560]  And he likes prosperity.
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.661]  When he went to Kim Jong-un, and Kim Jong-un reportedly cried in the meeting.
[00:20:15.642 --> 00:20:16.702]  Three hour meeting the first one.
[00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:18.924]  Four hour meeting the next time.
[00:20:20.124 --> 00:20:21.545]  And he cried when he came out with Trump.
[00:20:21.565 --> 00:20:22.185]  He was crying.
[00:20:23.066 --> 00:20:25.107]  And Trump said, stop being a puppet of the Chinese.
[00:20:25.747 --> 00:20:26.608]  Build hotels.
[00:20:26.688 --> 00:20:27.728]  Build golf courses.
[00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:30.010]  South Korea is the richest country in the world per capita.
[00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.590]  You could be just as rich as them.
[00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:32.531]  Stop being a punk.
[00:20:32.551 --> 00:20:35.633]  Reportedly Trump told him, stop being a punk.
[00:20:37.293 --> 00:20:48.235]   And showed him a CG graphic of the buildings being built, and the golf courses, and the fields, and the farms, and the vineyards, and the jets landing, and the money, and the success.
[00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:50.979]  See, that's what Trump wants.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.123]  And the New World Order doesn't want prosperity.
[00:20:53.343 --> 00:20:54.164]  They don't want freedom.
[00:20:55.014 --> 00:21:01.299]  They want all of us poor, no matter what color we are, while they fly around above us like gods, like something out of The Hunger Games.
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.703]  And it's not Hunger Games that's being copied, it's Hunger Games copying the dystopia.
[00:21:06.264 --> 00:21:08.646]  You watch Hunger Games, that's what the New World Order has planned.
[00:21:08.926 --> 00:21:20.696]  Super high-tech nation-states are gone, super high-tech city-states, and all the rest of us literally living hand-to-mouth, and that's the few percentage they're even allowed to live.
[00:21:22.338 --> 00:21:24.779]  And then we're just used in gladiatorial games for these people.
[00:21:25.659 --> 00:21:36.722]  It's BS and it's wrong, but with all this power and all this success and all of these ideas, you've got to make your children work hard, you've got to be strong, because success breeds decadence.
[00:21:38.583 --> 00:21:43.925]  Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create bad times.
[00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:48.686]  And that's the paradox of freedom.
[00:21:49.546 --> 00:21:50.927]  That's why you've got to have competition.
[00:21:51.792 --> 00:22:11.600]  And while you've got to have combat sports, and you've got to have people base jumping, and you've got to have people in the military, you've got to have people out there busting their ass, and you've got to throw people in jail if they shoot fellow kids in high school, but turn a blind eye when they're out back beating the living hell out of each other, because that's what you're supposed to do.
[00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:20.185]  So, we've got to be men again, and you've got to be women again, and we've got to be who we are.
[00:22:20.745 --> 00:22:21.966]  And dammit, we're going to do it.
[00:22:23.207 --> 00:22:26.989]  So, I could play the clips all day.
[00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:34.014]  We probably should get, you guys, just go into, there's archives of it, go into the post-debate CNN meltdown.
[00:22:34.954 --> 00:22:36.295]  We should probably air some clips of that.
[00:22:37.236 --> 00:22:39.938]  Roger Stone's coming up and jacking us up for three hours in studio with us.
[00:22:40.922 --> 00:22:42.363]  But, I mean, they shit their britches.
[00:22:43.144 --> 00:22:45.505]  They completely freaked out and said what they already knew.
[00:22:46.066 --> 00:22:47.887]  Biden is a near-vegetable.
[00:22:49.088 --> 00:22:51.310]  He is a total liability.
[00:22:51.330 --> 00:23:08.463]  And Axelrod's like, well, you better worry, we're going to replace him and the new person you better look out, because there will be no baggage with this new person, Big Mike, Hillary Clinton, Gavin Newsom, and then they slide him right in there and say, oh, it's a woman, it's Hillary, it's Kamala, oh, we're going to, you know, keep the loving abortion going.
[00:23:11.533 --> 00:23:16.094]  That's their plan to try to convince you that when they steal the election, they actually won.
[00:23:16.274 --> 00:23:18.215]  But they're now admitting Biden cannot win.
[00:23:18.555 --> 00:23:23.817]  CNN, AP, Reuters, MSNBC, Biden can't win, Biden can't win, Biden can't win.
[00:23:23.857 --> 00:23:25.317]  They've pulled the ripcord.
[00:23:25.857 --> 00:23:26.998]  They've pulled the parachute.
[00:23:28.418 --> 00:23:32.460]  But imagine them, four years ago, next level censorship.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.701]  Alex Jones is a new level of censorship, along with 11 other people.
[00:23:36.961 --> 00:23:39.962]  He's a dangerous person, you're allowed to call for violence against him, Facebook said.
[00:23:41.718 --> 00:23:42.098]  Remember that?
[00:23:42.759 --> 00:23:44.741]  They think organized violence can be so dangerous.
[00:23:46.242 --> 00:23:47.483]  And why did they quote?
[00:23:48.804 --> 00:23:52.287]  They said, Jones claims Biden has had some cognitive event.
[00:23:53.208 --> 00:23:54.389]  I said a stroke, an aneurysm.
[00:23:54.429 --> 00:23:54.730]  I don't know.
[00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:56.231]  He's had aneurysms before.
[00:23:56.471 --> 00:23:58.113]  He's had major brain surgery repeatedly.
[00:23:58.493 --> 00:24:03.618]  I said he went from like babbling some, but still sharp, you know, still there 90% to being there 50%.
[00:24:03.478 --> 00:24:13.076]   to being there 50%. That was seven and a half, eight years ago.
[00:24:13.076 --> 00:24:23.077]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:24:14.723 --> 00:24:25.546]  That was... That was the system totally getting upset that I was pointing out that Biden didn't know what planet he was on.
[00:24:27.346 --> 00:24:31.207]  And now he completely doesn't, and they tried to tell you those were fake videos.
[00:24:31.507 --> 00:24:35.188]  Now they know a deepfake is a completely computer-generated AI BS.
[00:24:36.208 --> 00:24:36.768]  CGI.
[00:24:37.609 --> 00:24:38.749]  Or AI.
[00:24:39.926 --> 00:24:41.507]  So they go, oh, we'll call it a cheap fake.
[00:24:41.547 --> 00:24:42.287]  That's a new thing.
[00:24:42.827 --> 00:24:45.188]  Meaning, well, it's not really fake, but it's edited deceptively.
[00:24:45.548 --> 00:24:46.068]  No, it's not.
[00:24:46.128 --> 00:24:52.690]  You can watch any Biden event and it is like watching cockroaches mate or something.
[00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:55.631]  I mean, it is disgusting.
[00:24:58.532 --> 00:25:00.693]  And so they told you he's really a genius.
[00:25:01.193 --> 00:25:03.473]  And what you saw on display is he is not a genius.
[00:25:03.814 --> 00:25:04.794]  He is a moron.
[00:25:05.839 --> 00:25:15.768]  And then, thousands of people on X, Rumble Crash, which is why it's important to have multiple platforms, why we have to pay for our own bandwidth, we streamed everything at Infowars.com forward slash show and man.video.
[00:25:16.108 --> 00:25:19.431]  We had over a million people watch on our streams last night.
[00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:37.516]   Three plus million on our multiple streams on X, but Jack Posobiec and Charlie Kirk, Infowars.com historic Jack Posobiec and Charlie Kirk's
[00:25:37.516 --> 00:25:45.137]   debate coverage gets 12.5 million, vitamin C trillion, views on X.
[00:25:45.137 --> 00:25:55.437]   Legacy Media is d-d-d-d-d-d-dead. And I didn't have time this morning to go check a bunch of stuff, but I saw dozens
[00:25:55.437 --> 00:25:58.137]  of accounts with hundreds of thousands or millions of views.
[00:25:58.137 --> 00:26:03.516]   And you know there's hundreds. So if we got three plus million on X alone, and then millions on radio stations
[00:26:03.516 --> 00:26:07.536]   listening, and a million on our system, the rest of it, Let's just be conservative.
[00:26:07.996 --> 00:26:09.798]  Seven million people tuned in to us last night.
[00:26:10.499 --> 00:26:12.981]  CNN normally, on its top show, has a million viewers.
[00:26:13.241 --> 00:26:14.822]  Most of its shows, 80,000.
[00:26:14.902 --> 00:26:16.144]  Is there not?
[00:26:16.284 --> 00:26:16.144]  80,000?
[00:26:16.304 --> 00:26:19.306]  86,000.
[00:26:17.465 --> 00:26:19.306]  Their average show, 86,000 viewers.
[00:26:19.346 --> 00:26:20.107]  They're a joke!
[00:26:20.487 --> 00:26:27.794]  This giant, rotting facade, thousands of employees, bureaus all over the country, huge buildings, and their average show has 80,000 views.
[00:26:27.834 --> 00:26:35.728]   I mean, I could Put a camera in my house on the wall of drying paint it had millions of views.
[00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.871]  These people are, they're a facade.
[00:26:42.851 --> 00:26:55.716]  And what happened last night was the last vestiges, because the cards have been dropping, the house of cards has been collapsing for years, but now in front of everybody we pull back and see the cards are all over the table, laying flat.
[00:26:56.796 --> 00:26:58.577]  There's not one card on top of another.
[00:27:00.177 --> 00:27:08.129]   The castles Built on sand, will fall into the sea, eventually.
[00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.131]  To quote the great, Jimi Hendrix.
[00:27:12.111 --> 00:27:14.751]  So, that's where we are.
[00:27:14.751 --> 00:27:24.271]  Come on, come on up.
[00:27:24.271 --> 00:27:27.470]  Come on, come on up.
[00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:30.711]  Come on, come on up.
[00:27:30.711 --> 00:27:40.711]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:27:32.099 --> 00:27:35.123]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby!
[00:27:35.404 --> 00:27:37.146]  Come on, come on, come on!
[00:27:39.469 --> 00:27:40.270]  Join Liberty!
[00:27:40.371 --> 00:27:41.392]  Join Team Humanity!
[00:27:41.652 --> 00:27:42.834]  You're built to do it!
[00:27:43.435 --> 00:27:44.616]  Join me now!
[00:27:46.377 --> 00:27:58.105]  Whether it's the World Economic Forum, whether it's the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, whether it's Open Philanthropy and Dustin Moskowitz, we know that all of these organizations thought that they could bamboozle all of us.
[00:27:58.526 --> 00:28:03.269]  They thought that by putting fact-checkers on every post, we'd stop sharing posts.
[00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:07.652]  They thought by canceling people that we wouldn't actually listen to people's voices.
[00:28:07.752 --> 00:28:11.215]   But the bad news is for them, We continue to do it.
[00:28:11.595 --> 00:28:13.415]  So what are the simple things that you can do?
[00:28:13.776 --> 00:28:19.818]  The simple things you can do, like I said before, support the alternative platforms that are allowing these voices to be heard.
[00:28:20.118 --> 00:28:22.579]  Make sure that you actually have these conversations.
[00:28:22.739 --> 00:28:27.601]  Without the utility of this voice and this platform, we will lose the war.
[00:28:28.021 --> 00:28:29.402]  So our job is really simple.
[00:28:29.842 --> 00:28:30.342]  Share this.
[00:28:30.442 --> 00:28:31.183]  Communicate this.
[00:28:31.263 --> 00:28:33.044]  Support the InfoWar.
[00:28:33.424 --> 00:28:38.886]  Go to InfoWarStore.com for products to keep strong and prepared.
[00:28:39.207 --> 00:28:43.369]  Donate and share the videos at Band.Video.
[00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:48.871]  Well, we've got the clips going back three years ago, but we need to play them.
[00:28:49.111 --> 00:28:53.674]  Maybe we'll put them in post later when we archive this at X and Real Alex Jones and Band.Video.
[00:28:53.694 --> 00:29:05.262]   But Roger, like a Visionary parrot has just been saying constantly, they're going to remove Biden at the DNC.
[00:29:06.042 --> 00:29:08.122]  And now we know it's in Chicago, it's going to be virtual.
[00:29:08.182 --> 00:29:11.903]  Well, now Axelrod, they're all announcing it, all the DNC people.
[00:29:12.824 --> 00:29:13.784]  The question is, who will it be?
[00:29:13.804 --> 00:29:22.206]  Well, the same guy that said they replaced him three years ago says it's Big Mike, aka Michelle Obama.
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:29.346]  And so they let Biden, who refuses to step down, walk into machine gun fire last night.
[00:29:31.748 --> 00:29:34.952]  And they're having to abandon their puppeteer.
[00:29:34.972 --> 00:29:36.934]  They were arrogant enough to try to force on us.
[00:29:36.994 --> 00:29:43.440]   But this clip that I Had the idea for him, had Chase Geyser create it a few
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.490]  hours ago, it's now got millions of views.
[00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:50.369]   It's going viral right now. And it's just Trump normally walking off the stage to the backstage
[00:29:50.369 --> 00:29:54.049]   where he's supposed to go. And Biden's just wandering off, not knowing where he is. And
[00:29:54.049 --> 00:29:59.088]   his wife having to help him down the stairs. This is emblematic of them saying, no, Biden's great.
[00:29:59.088 --> 00:30:02.338]  Biden's wonderful. And you made it up. They're cheap fakes.
[00:30:02.338 --> 00:30:05.694]   Well, was the whole debate last No, it wasn't.
[00:30:06.154 --> 00:30:08.777]  So again, the credibility was basically at zero.
[00:30:08.797 --> 00:30:10.819]  The corporate media is now negative zero.
[00:30:11.536 --> 00:30:13.797]  Like garbage is something that's worthless, you throw it away.
[00:30:14.477 --> 00:30:18.379]  This is like the black plague or cyanide.
[00:30:18.479 --> 00:30:22.821]  It's not just toxic, it's not just garbage, it's death.
[00:30:23.341 --> 00:30:28.924]  It's something that you bury in a deep hole and put a fence around, or you put the heart of a mountain.
[00:30:29.444 --> 00:30:31.265]  I mean, these people are anathema.
[00:30:31.565 --> 00:30:33.386]  Here's the clip that's gone mega viral.
[00:30:33.505 --> 00:30:34.505]  Here it is.
[00:30:34.505 --> 00:30:35.505]  Look at the bar.
[00:30:35.505 --> 00:30:36.505]  It's a little bit of a mess.
[00:30:36.505 --> 00:30:37.505]  I'm going to clean it up.
[00:30:37.505 --> 00:30:38.505]  I'm going to clean it up.
[00:30:38.505 --> 00:30:39.505]  I'm going to clean it up.
[00:30:39.505 --> 00:30:40.505]  I'm going to clean it up.
[00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:41.505]  I'm going to clean it up.
[00:30:41.505 --> 00:30:42.505]  I'm going to clean it up.
[00:30:43.222 --> 00:30:46.387]  Trump knows to walk to the backstage like a normal person.
[00:30:46.987 --> 00:30:50.212]  Biden, meanwhile, is like a lobotomized walrus.
[00:30:51.433 --> 00:30:52.114]  The cribkeeper.
[00:30:52.534 --> 00:30:54.534]  Here he is.
[00:30:54.534 --> 00:31:04.534]  [Music]
[00:31:04.534 --> 00:31:12.534]   Who can say where the road goes Where the day flows
[00:31:12.534 --> 00:31:21.534]   Only time And who can say if your love grows
[00:31:21.534 --> 00:31:26.534]   As your heart chose Only time
[00:31:26.534 --> 00:31:28.534]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now.
[00:31:29.291 --> 00:31:31.873]  InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:31:36.297 --> 00:31:36.617]  Alright.
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.722]  It was election night 2016 with Roger Stone.
[00:31:42.803 --> 00:31:44.224]  And he was celebrating, so was Owen.
[00:31:44.885 --> 00:31:48.988]  And he's like, this is great, we're gonna save the country, we're gonna turn it around, America's gonna win.
[00:31:49.629 --> 00:31:52.471]  And I looked at Roger, who's very smart, and most of the time is smarter than me.
[00:31:53.072 --> 00:31:55.734]  And I said, Roger, I can feel the disturbance in the force.
[00:31:55.754 --> 00:31:56.775]  They're coming after us all.
[00:31:57.215 --> 00:31:57.976]  They're gonna try to kill us.
[00:31:57.996 --> 00:31:59.898]  The CIA already runs the country.
[00:32:00.398 --> 00:32:01.119]  Trump's for real.
[00:32:01.219 --> 00:32:02.160]  They're gonna come after us all.
[00:32:03.393 --> 00:32:04.514]  He said, we'll have the presidency.
[00:32:05.135 --> 00:32:06.656]  And the next morning, we stayed up all night.
[00:32:06.996 --> 00:32:08.318]  He drove off at like 6 a.m.
[00:32:08.338 --> 00:32:08.878]  to the airport.
[00:32:09.178 --> 00:32:10.179]  He just laughed at me.
[00:32:10.339 --> 00:32:14.904]  He said, Alex, be confident, you know, because he's been in administrations when, like, Nixon was actually president.
[00:32:14.924 --> 00:32:16.505]  So he's like, well, we're going to turn it around.
[00:32:16.965 --> 00:32:18.487]  I don't bring that up to toot my horn.
[00:32:19.328 --> 00:32:20.309]  I want to explain now.
[00:32:20.329 --> 00:32:21.570]  I have the opposite feeling.
[00:32:25.133 --> 00:32:27.595]  The entire power structure is collapsing worldwide.
[00:32:27.855 --> 00:32:29.157]  Populists are winning everywhere.
[00:32:30.848 --> 00:32:33.370]  Fake conservatives are being thrown out all over the place.
[00:32:34.251 --> 00:32:37.053]  True populists are winning every parliamentary election in the world.
[00:32:37.093 --> 00:32:38.754]  This is a global political realignment.
[00:32:39.414 --> 00:32:44.058]  I feel satisfaction that in 50 years I've never felt.
[00:32:44.898 --> 00:32:46.420]  And believe me, I felt some satisfaction.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.541]  Let's talk a little more action.
[00:32:50.703 --> 00:32:55.887]  To quote Elvis, I'm at a level of satisfaction right now that is dizzying.
[00:32:56.427 --> 00:33:00.150]  Now that said, the enemy is even more dangerous than trying to launch World War III.
[00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:02.872]  And they're going to use this to replace Biden.
[00:33:02.912 --> 00:33:04.494]  But they tried to prop him up.
[00:33:04.514 --> 00:33:08.599]  So no matter who they bring forward now, people recognize that these are puppets.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:16.789]  So no matter if they bring us the most sparkly puppet we've ever seen, the most effervescent little genius cherubim, no one is buying this.
[00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:20.434]  This is a global, massive, total rout.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.821]  And it's ours to lose.
[00:33:22.901 --> 00:33:32.289]  I mean, I just have to tell everybody, I 100% know the tide has completely turned and that we are in the driver's seat.
[00:33:32.369 --> 00:33:33.170]  It's ours to lose.
[00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.612]  But let's then not be too confident though, my spirit.
[00:33:36.432 --> 00:33:38.913]  is telling me, "Job well done, sir."
[00:33:38.913 --> 00:33:43.393]   Like, I've still got work to do, but this is a major completion moment
[00:33:43.393 --> 00:33:45.093]  in our primary operation.
[00:33:45.093 --> 00:33:48.791]   Roger, we haven't talked since last night when you went off at midnight with us.
[00:33:48.791 --> 00:33:54.552]   Jack Pasovic flew in, he hasn't slept, you probably haven't slept, my God.
[00:33:54.552 --> 00:33:58.752]   But as the Wolf says in Pulp Fiction, let's not start celebrating quite yet.
[00:33:58.937 --> 00:34:00.559]  So Roger, you just heard my intro.
[00:34:00.759 --> 00:34:04.141]  I don't know where you're at right now, but I don't know what you're feeling right now.
[00:34:04.181 --> 00:34:07.624]  The gut's always the most important, but this is spectacular.
[00:34:09.522 --> 00:34:20.213]  Well, Alex, I agree with you that the deep state, the Democrat fake news media cabal is in high dungeon this morning.
[00:34:20.993 --> 00:34:33.326]  What impressed me, of course, is the speed by which everybody on the Democratic left moved immediately to the pre-distributed talking points about Joe has to go.
[00:34:34.367 --> 00:34:50.907]  In retrospect, I always wondered why this debate challenge was made in June, months before the Democratic Party will have a legal nominee, weeks before, almost a month before, the Republican Party will have a legal nominee.
[00:34:50.947 --> 00:34:53.110]  And now I think we know the reason.
[00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:56.132]  Joe is notoriously stubborn.
[00:34:56.552 --> 00:34:59.234]  Joe's wife doesn't want to go anywhere.
[00:35:00.215 --> 00:35:05.899]  They're in denial about his physical condition or his ability to win an election.
[00:35:06.359 --> 00:35:13.164]  I suspect that they had already repelled efforts within the party, most likely led by the party leader.
[00:35:13.784 --> 00:35:16.446]  Barack Obama to step aside.
[00:35:17.226 --> 00:35:20.348]  Now, I think they've set this situation up.
[00:35:21.189 --> 00:35:28.733]  The only reason I say that with greater certainty is there was virtually no Democrat out defending Joe Biden yesterday.
[00:35:28.833 --> 00:35:29.914]  Virtually none.
[00:35:30.715 --> 00:35:42.442]  And the immediate reaction condemning his performance as horrific and calling for a reaction was universal with, of course, CNN leading the way.
[00:35:45.811 --> 00:35:51.113]  Roger, the story you tell all the time, I only bring it up because it's archetypal, on Election Night 2016.
[00:35:51.653 --> 00:35:54.674]  Talk about that, and then what is your gut now about what we're facing?
[00:35:55.514 --> 00:36:00.556]  Because I'm 50 now, and when I was younger I always ignored my spirit, my gut, the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:01.396 --> 00:36:02.237]  That's what it is, folks.
[00:36:02.677 --> 00:36:06.018]  It's our ancestors, it's God's connection, it's all our will, it's who we are.
[00:36:06.038 --> 00:36:08.379]  We're not just one person, we are an individual, we're a collective.
[00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:12.800]  The collective in me is just smelling victory, but the enemy has a lot of tricks.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.681]  But just, what is your gut right now?
[00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:21.152]  Well, first of all, looking at that clip, Alex, it's amazing how much both of us have aged since then.
[00:36:21.172 --> 00:36:24.713]  But it's also amazing how much both of us have been through.
[00:36:25.693 --> 00:36:27.994]  We're up against an implacable enemy.
[00:36:28.154 --> 00:36:32.115]  There is no limit to the tactics and things they will do.
[00:36:32.595 --> 00:36:38.297]  The law, the Constitution, the facts, the evidence, none of these things ever slow them down.
[00:36:38.657 --> 00:36:41.858]  They still have control of the legacy media.
[00:36:42.158 --> 00:36:45.059]  And we kid ourselves if we say that's not influential.
[00:36:45.819 --> 00:36:51.202]  It's no longer a monopoly as it once was, but it's still quite powerful.
[00:36:51.603 --> 00:36:54.064]  I think there are a lot of complications here for the Democrats.
[00:36:54.084 --> 00:36:58.007]  It's absolutely clear that Joe Biden cannot win this election.
[00:36:58.407 --> 00:37:01.709]  I don't think a second debate with Trump is likely.
[00:37:02.269 --> 00:37:04.711]  Trump should now challenge Joe to another debate.
[00:37:05.011 --> 00:37:06.552]  Joe will not accept.
[00:37:07.372 --> 00:37:10.274]  But they have a lot of internal problems.
[00:37:10.314 --> 00:37:12.115]  First of all, the successor.
[00:37:12.595 --> 00:37:20.541]  Now, yes, I have been predicting for over three years that Michelle Obama is the most likely nominee.
[00:37:21.122 --> 00:37:25.925]  Recognize I never said that she would reach for it or that she wanted to run for it.
[00:37:25.985 --> 00:37:28.207]  You've always said they will draft her in the 11 hour.
[00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:30.010]  Right, exactly.
[00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:36.593]  And they will convince her to do it based on the argument that she has the best chance to defeat Trump.
[00:37:37.093 --> 00:37:41.095]  We still don't have any polling that shows that, but let's see how that develops.
[00:37:41.555 --> 00:37:45.376]  But the Clinton crime family, clearly making their move.
[00:37:45.736 --> 00:37:50.878]  Hillary Clinton has never gotten over the fact that she was beaten in 2016.
[00:37:51.859 --> 00:37:57.721]  She demanded that Trump say before the election that he would accept the election results.
[00:37:58.181 --> 00:38:02.525]  He declined, saying, I'll only accept it if it's clean, fair, and honest.
[00:38:02.565 --> 00:38:10.332]  And of course, she was then the one who challenged the outcome of the election, filing for recounts in Michigan and Pennsylvania and so on.
[00:38:10.872 --> 00:38:13.034]  So they have to repel Hillary.
[00:38:13.134 --> 00:38:20.000]  I'm sure that she has designs on that presidential nomination, or maybe her strategy is more diabolical.
[00:38:20.281 --> 00:38:23.904]  In other words, maybe she wants the vice presidential nomination.
[00:38:23.924 --> 00:38:24.885]  Or Secretary of State again.
[00:38:26.253 --> 00:38:27.414]  I don't see her doing that.
[00:38:27.994 --> 00:38:29.515]  I think she's already had that job.
[00:38:30.256 --> 00:38:33.138]  This is no longer about Clinton's ability to steal.
[00:38:33.518 --> 00:38:38.942]  Now it's about power, raw power, and in many ways, revenge.
[00:38:40.243 --> 00:38:43.625]  And the Clintons and the Obamas, trust me, there is no love lost.
[00:38:44.065 --> 00:38:46.586]  Between those families, none whatsoever.
[00:38:47.066 --> 00:39:04.134]  What I think was a leaked story yesterday morning, appeared in both Axios and in the New York Post, that Michelle Obama refuses to campaign for Joe Biden because she does not like the treatment the Bidens are subjecting one of their daughter-in-laws to.
[00:39:04.194 --> 00:39:09.657]   I think this is, I believe it's Bo's late wife, although I'm not I read it very quickly.
[00:39:09.898 --> 00:39:11.399]  That was a planted story.
[00:39:11.459 --> 00:39:13.001]  There's no question in my mind.
[00:39:13.361 --> 00:39:25.294]  When you see something from Axios, that is the establishment, that is the Democrat-media combine floating trial balloons or going on the attack.
[00:39:28.635 --> 00:39:29.296]  Quantifying.
[00:39:29.858 --> 00:39:30.820]  How big a victory is this?
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.503]  But what are our chinks in the armor?
[00:39:32.944 --> 00:39:33.966]  What will the deep state do now?
[00:39:34.026 --> 00:39:37.032]  I mean, they're really hyping full war with Russia.
[00:39:37.052 --> 00:39:38.976]  They might even try to cancel the election.
[00:39:38.996 --> 00:39:39.818]  I mean, they're that desperate.
[00:39:40.802 --> 00:39:45.263]  Well, first of all, let's not, let's not understate what a tremendous victory this is for Donald Trump.
[00:39:45.623 --> 00:39:50.965]  As I said to you last night before the debate, this guy is just a cool customer.
[00:39:51.305 --> 00:39:53.286]  He was extremely disciplined.
[00:39:54.146 --> 00:39:55.986]  I think he made it all... I'm ultra impressed.
[00:39:56.026 --> 00:39:59.507]  He looks younger than four years ago and was just sly.
[00:39:59.647 --> 00:40:01.508]  I mean, it was just, it was amazing.
[00:40:02.128 --> 00:40:04.769]  I mean, he's definitely, he's more hardcore now.
[00:40:06.184 --> 00:40:10.110]  He's more hardcore and he never let the thing get under his skin.
[00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:12.333]  He was never condescending to him.
[00:40:12.353 --> 00:40:15.076]  I did get off some funny lines as he always does.
[00:40:15.737 --> 00:40:19.582]  I love that thing where he just kind of shakes his head like how ridiculous.
[00:40:19.803 --> 00:40:22.186]  Or when Biden says he's better at golf than Trump.
[00:40:23.362 --> 00:40:25.264]  Yeah, we need to schedule a round.
[00:40:25.284 --> 00:40:27.726]  I mean, that may be the biggest lie of the entire event.
[00:40:27.746 --> 00:40:29.387]  Let's go through Biden's lies.
[00:40:29.447 --> 00:40:33.151]  No, Trump did not tell people to inject bleach over COVID-19.
[00:40:33.211 --> 00:40:36.234]  No, he did not ever say the suckers and losers.
[00:40:36.254 --> 00:40:37.395]  There were 20 witnesses.
[00:40:37.875 --> 00:40:40.377]  One person said he said it, a guy that he fired.
[00:40:40.397 --> 00:40:41.578]  And he doesn't love Hitler.
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:45.262]  And there were 19 other witnesses who say it.
[00:40:45.942 --> 00:40:46.663]  Sorry, I'm interrupted.
[00:40:46.703 --> 00:40:47.203]  Go to the lies.
[00:40:47.243 --> 00:40:47.744]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:40:48.443 --> 00:40:49.682]  Not how he feels.
[00:40:49.682 --> 00:40:56.043]   And then, of course, the Charlottesville many fine people, which even Snopes, the
[00:40:56.043 --> 00:41:01.443]  most left wing of fact checkers debunked only days ago.
[00:41:01.443 --> 00:41:07.523]   Yet, if you go on the media today, it's all about the many lies.
[00:41:07.523 --> 00:41:12.443]  Why didn't Jake and Dana call Trump out on his lies?
[00:41:12.845 --> 00:41:18.767]  I can't find any lies, but the biggest lie of the night may be that Joe Biden has a six handicap at golf.
[00:41:19.787 --> 00:41:20.428]  I agree with Trump.
[00:41:20.448 --> 00:41:24.329]  I don't think he could hit the ball 50 yards, not 50 yards.
[00:41:25.529 --> 00:41:29.270]  And then he said that they're not supporting post-birth abortion.
[00:41:29.811 --> 00:41:31.431]  New York and other states have passed laws.
[00:41:31.491 --> 00:41:34.012]  The governor of Virginia at the time admitted it.
[00:41:35.771 --> 00:41:46.201]  Yeah, I just posted that link online a few minutes ago, where the governor said, yeah, we make the baby comfortable, then we consult with the mother, and then, you know, essentially we kill the baby.
[00:41:46.262 --> 00:41:52.548]  So, for those Democrats out there saying, oh no, there are no nine-month abortions, that is, of course, a lie.
[00:41:54.149 --> 00:42:10.190]   One thing I do think, one important impact here, I thought about this this morning, is In view of the fact that you could have one and maybe even two women on the Democratic ticket, I still think the president needs to preserve his options regarding a running mate.
[00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:15.718]  I think he may want to reconsider either Tulsi Gabbard or Elise Stefanik.
[00:42:16.258 --> 00:42:18.440]  Either one of which would be great with me.
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.242]  I'm a Tulsi supporter.
[00:42:20.262 --> 00:42:22.184]  I've made no bones about it.
[00:42:22.284 --> 00:42:24.926]  I think she would bring a great deal to the ticket.
[00:42:25.627 --> 00:42:29.350]  I think you may want to re-examine that in light of these developments.
[00:42:30.211 --> 00:42:37.658]  How can you pick your vice president when you don't even know who the Democrat nominee for president and vice president is going to be?
[00:42:38.238 --> 00:42:42.701]   And then additionally, you have Growing legal problems.
[00:42:42.821 --> 00:42:46.602]  I mean, I think it's too late to get Joe Biden's name off the ballot in Wisconsin.
[00:42:46.642 --> 00:42:49.903]  I believe it's too late to get his name off the ballot in Nevada.
[00:42:50.703 --> 00:42:52.164]  Georgia's very tight.
[00:42:52.204 --> 00:42:59.985]  You've got to get your name off 75 days or 74 days before the election or two months before the election.
[00:43:00.005 --> 00:43:00.505]  I guess it is.
[00:43:00.845 --> 00:43:08.067]   Texas is another place where Removal of Joe's name and replacement could be problematic.
[00:43:08.067 --> 00:43:11.907]  So they don't have a lot of time to work this out.
[00:43:11.907 --> 00:43:14.346]  They have to work it out immediately.
[00:43:14.346 --> 00:43:23.786]   I still think the course of events here is Barack Obama, ultimately if he has to, goes to Joe privately and says,
[00:43:23.786 --> 00:43:28.425]   "Look, we have enough votes within the cabinet and the acquiescence of the vice president
[00:43:28.425 --> 00:43:33.067]   to remove you under the 25th amendment for your own good Joe, because you're not well."
[00:43:33.524 --> 00:43:50.735]   And if you if you'll just simply announce that you're not going to run, but you don't have to resign, you can retain the power and the authority to pardon your son, pardon your brother, pardon yourself, pardon other members of 100% that's where that's going.
[00:43:50.835 --> 00:43:52.935]  So what's the time frame you say it's got to be done right now?
[00:43:54.156 --> 00:43:59.137]  I think it starts, if it hasn't already started, it'll start almost immediately.
[00:43:59.318 --> 00:44:00.458]  So that's going on right now?
[00:44:02.038 --> 00:44:03.019]  Most likely, sure.
[00:44:03.699 --> 00:44:12.282]  I mean, it's just, it's amazing the lockstep in which everybody fell in line within minutes of saying, that was a disaster, Joe has to go.
[00:44:12.522 --> 00:44:29.522]   I mean, it was, there was, I couldn't find a Democrat Okay, so let's look at this.
[00:44:29.702 --> 00:44:31.003]  Operation Replace Biden.
[00:44:31.103 --> 00:44:33.745]  That's drudge headline right now, today.
[00:44:34.205 --> 00:44:36.227]  Operation Replace Joe Biden.
[00:44:37.087 --> 00:44:42.451]  Then we've got David Asselrod tells GOP strategists, if Biden's replaced, you guys are in trouble.
[00:44:42.891 --> 00:44:43.892]  You think that's a true statement?
[00:44:44.132 --> 00:44:44.913]  I think that's more bluff.
[00:44:47.114 --> 00:44:52.238]  Uh, Axelrod has been one who has been critical of Biden.
[00:44:52.278 --> 00:44:57.942]  So that almost is completely inconsistent with his previous statements, as I recall.
[00:44:59.103 --> 00:45:02.986]  But and he is most definitely the Obama's front man.
[00:45:03.467 --> 00:45:17.615]   But if you were doing this privately, if you're doing it backstage, You might want to have Axelrod out as a decoy, so as to not reveal the fact that the Obamas are probably moving right now on Joe.
[00:45:19.236 --> 00:45:20.717]  Well, there's no doubt, and I'll read the headline again.
[00:45:20.757 --> 00:45:24.139]  David Axelrod tells GOP strategists, if Biden's replaced, you guys are in trouble.
[00:45:24.479 --> 00:45:27.541]  So he's actually saying, get rid of Biden, and you guys are in trouble.
[00:45:28.502 --> 00:45:33.845]  Again, why do you think Big Mike, even since for three years, why is Big Mike their favorite candidate?
[00:45:35.455 --> 00:45:40.183]  Uh, first of all, she's probably the most popular Democrat in the country.
[00:45:40.263 --> 00:45:44.991]  She has no voting record, no administrative record, no political record to be attacked.
[00:45:46.004 --> 00:45:52.129]  She can disassociate herself with some of the more disastrous policies of Joe Biden.
[00:45:52.629 --> 00:46:03.096]  And the media will help her get away with that, even though those policies were probably in many cases dictated by her husband or the people around him.
[00:46:04.097 --> 00:46:08.600]  Look, politics, as you know, Alex, a day is a lifetime.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:18.010]   It's very hard in polling to measure When you're in the middle of the eye of the storm, you kind of need to let things settle down a little bit.
[00:46:18.851 --> 00:46:29.961]  The polls that have been taken that show other candidates against Trump, either Gavin Newsom or even Michelle Obama herself, or Michelle Obama herself, or...
[00:46:31.801 --> 00:46:37.463]  Or Gavin Newsom, have shown Trump beating all three of them pretty handily.
[00:46:37.543 --> 00:46:42.205]  So, there is no empirical evidence to support what Axelrod has said.
[00:46:42.225 --> 00:46:43.986]  You're right, I misunderstood the headline there.
[00:46:44.386 --> 00:46:48.767]  But expanding on that, expanding on that, Jack Masabic's here, he's about to coast with me.
[00:46:49.228 --> 00:46:51.008]  He's really smart geopolitically, as you know.
[00:46:51.388 --> 00:46:53.269]  Not as soon as naval intelligence, but all those other connections.
[00:46:53.309 --> 00:46:54.109]  He's a smart guy.
[00:46:54.409 --> 00:46:55.010]  He's been dead on.
[00:46:56.130 --> 00:47:01.611]  He said the big takeaway is Biden getting all animated about Article 5 and NATO going to war with Russia.
[00:47:01.971 --> 00:47:06.832]  With 129 days left, isn't that the big October surprise we should be worried about?
[00:47:08.033 --> 00:47:10.253]  I think they've almost, they've virtually announced it.
[00:47:10.293 --> 00:47:14.354]  They say in September that Ukraine will be joining NATO.
[00:47:14.614 --> 00:47:17.235]  I'm afraid that that is a triggering event.
[00:47:17.835 --> 00:47:22.936]  And let's explain that because Article 5 says any attack on NATO, all of NATO will attack that target.
[00:47:24.216 --> 00:47:27.558]  Putin came in and said you're trying to join NATO and they said no we're not, no we're not.
[00:47:27.918 --> 00:47:36.123]  Now they're officially putting in NATO troops who have already been there for years and so now they're going to retroactively have them join and then say we're officially at war.
[00:47:36.203 --> 00:47:40.585]  So having Ukraine join is a declaration of war.
[00:47:40.605 --> 00:47:46.348]  People need to understand, having Ukraine join NATO is a declaration of war on Russia period 100% done.
[00:47:48.311 --> 00:47:58.823]  Well, and look at Max Blumenthal, whose politics are most certainly not mine, but even he has reported on the fact that the silos where the U.S.
[00:47:58.883 --> 00:48:02.928]  paid for NATO missiles would be mounted are already built.
[00:48:05.911 --> 00:48:14.455]  When you say join NATO, what we really mean is mount NATO missiles on the ground in Ukraine pointed at Russia.
[00:48:14.515 --> 00:48:17.316]  That, I'm afraid, is the triggering event.
[00:48:17.676 --> 00:48:20.777]  That is something that Putin cannot ignore.
[00:48:21.377 --> 00:48:27.480]   Putin has, my understanding, just based on reading, His own internal pressures.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.081]  He has a right wing, a militaristic right wing.
[00:48:30.621 --> 00:48:32.883]  They want to know why he's not being more aggressive.
[00:48:33.563 --> 00:48:41.046]  I'd hate to believe that that includes the use of tactical nuclear weapons, but they have them.
[00:48:41.146 --> 00:48:41.907]  They will use them.
[00:48:41.927 --> 00:48:51.071]  So do you think the establishment is crazy enough to do this or they let Trump get in and then crash the economy like Herbert Hoover and blame him that way?
[00:48:52.918 --> 00:48:53.879]  Well, a couple things.
[00:48:53.939 --> 00:49:02.025]  First, they may believe that in a wartime that the people will rally to a wartime president and that that may be a way to save Joe.
[00:49:03.946 --> 00:49:06.588]  I don't see how it bolsters a Joe replacement.
[00:49:06.948 --> 00:49:12.852]  The most important thing about last night is that Trump emerges as the peace candidate.
[00:49:13.233 --> 00:49:16.115]  He is without any question the peace candidate.
[00:49:16.915 --> 00:49:27.514]   The fact that the Libertarians nominated a Wild-eyed progressive who I think finds transgenderism as the driving issue of his presidential campaign means that
[00:49:28.454 --> 00:49:36.239]  Libertarians, both in the party and natural libertarians who aren't in the party, I think are going to gravitate to that pro-peace message.
[00:49:36.279 --> 00:49:43.683]  They certainly don't think Trump is perfect in every regard, but he really is... Sure, I totally agree.
[00:49:43.723 --> 00:49:46.865]  I mean, the real polls, Trump's 20 points ahead, 15 points in battlegrounds.
[00:49:47.145 --> 00:49:49.767]  As long as we go out and vote and expose the fraud, they don't have enough people to vote.
[00:49:50.387 --> 00:49:50.888]  In closing...
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.681]  How's Trump doing?
[00:49:53.701 --> 00:49:54.843]  You talk to him, I know, every day.
[00:49:54.863 --> 00:49:57.366]  I know you talked to him before the debate, you talked to him after.
[00:49:57.846 --> 00:49:58.867]  I'm really impressed.
[00:49:58.907 --> 00:50:03.172]  I mean, this is, for 78 years old, this is a man of steel, folks, because I work hard.
[00:50:03.232 --> 00:50:07.738]  I worked 17, 18 hours yesterday, and it beat the living hell out of me.
[00:50:08.118 --> 00:50:08.639]  I'm 50.
[00:50:08.759 --> 00:50:09.920]  How the hell does Trump do it?
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:11.262]  I mean, he is a war horse.
[00:50:13.174 --> 00:50:18.659]  Well, I haven't spoken to him yet today, but I must tell you that I've known him 45 years.
[00:50:18.699 --> 00:50:21.321]  He's always had this kind of stamina.
[00:50:21.381 --> 00:50:23.163]  He's always had this kind of work ethic.
[00:50:23.683 --> 00:50:29.168]  Before he was in politics in the winters, he would fly from New York to Palm Beach for the weekend.
[00:50:29.568 --> 00:50:37.035]  He would leave on Friday, usually in the late afternoon, but he would always insist on flying back not Monday morning, but Sunday night.
[00:50:37.695 --> 00:50:38.896]  And he was a billionaire.
[00:50:39.096 --> 00:50:42.618]  And I said, well, why don't you just take it easy and fly back Monday morning?
[00:50:42.698 --> 00:50:43.519]  Got your own jet?
[00:50:43.879 --> 00:50:44.959]  He said, no, no, no, no.
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.682]  I've got to be at my desk at 7 o'clock Monday morning to work.
[00:50:49.482 --> 00:50:51.123]  He's always had that work ethic.
[00:50:51.163 --> 00:50:56.026]  He's always had this kind of stamina, this kind of physical energy.
[00:50:56.346 --> 00:50:58.367]  He is an extraordinary athlete.
[00:50:58.467 --> 00:51:01.569]  I would love to see a round of golf with Joe Biden.
[00:51:01.649 --> 00:51:06.592]  I was about to say, not kissing his ass, but professional golfers say if they don't focus, Trump beats them.
[00:51:07.723 --> 00:51:08.464]  He's that good.
[00:51:08.524 --> 00:51:09.605]  He could have been a professional golfer.
[00:51:10.646 --> 00:51:11.747]  He's a scratch golfer.
[00:51:11.767 --> 00:51:18.573]  He just won, as he said last night, two tournaments, and they weren't even the senior tournaments.
[00:51:19.153 --> 00:51:22.456]  He's an amazing athlete, but it's more than just the physical.
[00:51:23.116 --> 00:51:24.978]  It's really the mental discipline.
[00:51:24.998 --> 00:51:27.000]  He has enormous mental discipline.
[00:51:28.261 --> 00:51:30.483]  I've never known him to be... And that's what the professional golfers said.
[00:51:30.523 --> 00:51:35.227]  They said, if Trump gets behind, and they don't totally pay attention to professional golfers, he beats them.
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:38.721]  I mean, he'll do like, he'll in two hits put it in the hole.
[00:51:38.761 --> 00:51:41.462]  They're like, if they don't do full focus, he beats him.
[00:51:42.742 --> 00:51:45.263]  Well, but the other point here is the mental discipline.
[00:51:45.303 --> 00:51:47.864]  In other words, given everything he's going through.
[00:51:47.884 --> 00:51:50.085]  My point though is when he's down, he gets even better.
[00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:52.311]  Yes, I think that's true.
[00:51:52.351 --> 00:51:54.832]  He's at his best under pressure.
[00:51:55.152 --> 00:51:56.173]  No question about that.
[00:51:56.233 --> 00:51:59.775]  And let's face it, he's a brawler and he relishes a fight.
[00:51:59.835 --> 00:52:02.337]  He never walks away from a fight.
[00:52:02.357 --> 00:52:08.801]  I mean, traditionally, as you know, Alex, you would have the presidential candidate remain above the fray.
[00:52:09.141 --> 00:52:16.345]  You'd have the vice presidential candidate be the person out there bringing the partisan fight to the Democrats, like Nixon did for Eisenhower.
[00:52:17.006 --> 00:52:19.888]  But Donald Trump is his own attack dog.
[00:52:19.989 --> 00:52:25.674]  I mean, he has no qualms about taking on the deep state, taking on the Democrats.
[00:52:26.855 --> 00:52:32.161]  He's an enormously talented, disciplined individual.
[00:52:32.181 --> 00:52:33.682]  Well, we should all be praying for him.
[00:52:33.902 --> 00:52:34.963]  StoneZone.com.
[00:52:35.043 --> 00:52:37.126]  Roger, I'm probably doing an emergency Saturday show tomorrow.
[00:52:37.686 --> 00:52:38.567]  The news is too important.
[00:52:38.587 --> 00:52:39.408]  Please join us again.
[00:52:39.448 --> 00:52:39.888]  We love you.
[00:52:39.928 --> 00:52:40.429]  Thank you, Roger.
[00:52:41.348 --> 00:52:42.268]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[00:52:42.108 --> 00:52:43.108]  God bless you.
[00:52:43.108 --> 00:52:46.428]   All right, I just did an hour of live radio and TV and did not plug once.
[00:52:46.428 --> 00:52:47.428]  So we found the operation.
[00:52:47.428 --> 00:52:54.188]   Go to drjonesnaturals.com, our amazing sponsor, a huge sales on TurboForce, 10-hour clean
[00:52:54.188 --> 00:52:59.708]   energy, next level foundational energy, all the nano silver products at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:52:59.708 --> 00:53:01.588]  You want to support us, get great products, go there now.
[00:53:01.588 --> 00:53:03.147]  We'll be right back with Jack Posobiec.
[00:53:03.147 --> 00:53:04.147]  Stay with us.
[00:53:04.147 --> 00:53:12.068]   When I look at Bitcoin as a historian, I don't like it because this is a money built on a
[00:53:12.068 --> 00:53:14.748]  distrust.
[00:53:13.925 --> 00:53:17.227]  The central idea of Bitcoin is basically electronic gold.
[00:53:17.988 --> 00:53:26.853]  That we don't trust the banks, the governments, so we don't want to give them the ability to create as much money as they like.
[00:53:27.573 --> 00:53:29.235]  So we create this Bitcoin.
[00:53:29.795 --> 00:53:31.856]  It's a currency of distrust.
[00:53:32.537 --> 00:53:32.877]  Of you.
[00:53:32.897 --> 00:53:35.759]  I do think that the future belongs to electronic money.
[00:53:36.679 --> 00:53:51.933]  But what we've seen over the last centuries is that it's actually a good idea to give banks and governments the ability to create more and more money for themselves in order to build more trust within society.
[00:53:53.243 --> 00:54:06.907]  So, I'm not sure what kind, what money would look like in 20 years or 30 years, but I hope it will be a currency of greater trust and not a currency of distrust.
[00:54:07.227 --> 00:54:10.968]  Finishing up, you all know Harari and just how full of crap he is as an economist.
[00:54:11.569 --> 00:54:12.769]  You as an economist watching him.
[00:54:13.993 --> 00:54:17.155]  So I'm watching that and I'm thinking, is this guy absolutely nuts?
[00:54:17.415 --> 00:54:18.576]  I mean, he is a smart guy.
[00:54:18.636 --> 00:54:20.518]  He's evil, but he's a smart guy.
[00:54:20.998 --> 00:54:35.628]  How could he say that printing money is going to bring trust when so much in our society right now is people can't afford to eat, they can't afford to pay their mortgage or their rent or buy food or do anything, right?
[00:54:35.828 --> 00:54:38.510]  Inflation doesn't bring trust.
[00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:41.032]  He's misusing the word trust.
[00:54:41.853 --> 00:54:46.373]  Because what he's actually saying is, hey, when we print money...
[00:54:47.122 --> 00:54:52.245]  We're going to be able to give you Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, handouts, stimulus.
[00:54:52.925 --> 00:54:56.187]  We'll raise the debt ceiling to keep this game perpetuated.
[00:54:56.607 --> 00:54:57.988]  We'll do all of this stuff.
[00:54:58.628 --> 00:55:02.090]  And so then the people will say, trust?
[00:55:02.170 --> 00:55:02.350]  What?
[00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:05.932]  It's like, I'll tolerate you because you're giving me free stuff.
[00:55:06.532 --> 00:55:07.693]  That's not trust.
[00:55:08.173 --> 00:55:12.155]  That's accepting they're garbage because they're giving you free stuff.
[00:55:12.215 --> 00:55:14.616]  That comes with printing of money excessively.
[00:55:15.137 --> 00:55:15.277]  So.
[00:55:15.837 --> 00:55:19.000]  Misuse of the word trust because I don't think he's a dumb guy.
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:24.465]  I think he's evil, beyond evil, who has no respect for human life.
[00:55:24.665 --> 00:55:27.608]  They just said that we're going to continue to print money.
[00:55:28.049 --> 00:55:34.475]  We're going to continue to make people dependent on the government for all of their needs.
[00:55:35.015 --> 00:55:39.458]  Because the government wants to take the place of God in people's lives.
[00:55:39.918 --> 00:55:43.761]  And that statement, when you dissect what he said, that's what he's saying.
[00:55:44.281 --> 00:55:46.223]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[00:55:46.503 --> 00:55:46.983]  Check them out.
[00:55:47.043 --> 00:55:47.644]  Go on the site.
[00:55:48.084 --> 00:55:48.464]  Call them.
[00:55:48.524 --> 00:55:49.385]  Get a consultation.
[00:55:49.485 --> 00:55:49.925]  Email them.
[00:55:49.945 --> 00:55:50.486]  Talk to them.
[00:55:50.506 --> 00:55:50.806]  720-605-3900.
[00:55:50.666 --> 00:55:51.666]  720-605-3900.
[00:55:51.666 --> 00:55:52.666]  Again, that's 720-605-3900.
[00:55:52.666 --> 00:56:01.505]   One of the most important calls you would make, obviously, and like he's been saying,
[00:56:01.505 --> 00:56:03.505]  get silver, 40% on the year.
[00:56:03.505 --> 00:56:07.705]   He says that he'll make such profits in silver, when the gold run starts, you use that profit
[00:56:07.705 --> 00:56:12.426]   to buy the gold and you sell it back to Dr. Kirk Elliott with zero cost, which no big
[00:56:12.426 --> 00:56:14.426]  broker, no big company does.
[00:56:14.426 --> 00:56:18.666]  That's why there are 4.7 star ratings that nobody else has.
[00:56:18.666 --> 00:56:25.666]   He's got a lot of people that are in the gold business, and he's got a lot of people that's
[00:56:25.666 --> 00:56:26.666]  in the silver business.
[00:56:26.666 --> 00:56:27.666]  He's got a lot of people that are in the gold business.
[00:56:27.666 --> 00:56:28.666]  He's got a lot of people that's in the silver business.
[00:56:29.161 --> 00:56:30.061]  What did he just say?
[00:56:31.422 --> 00:56:33.062]  He said there's a storm coming in.
[00:56:38.043 --> 00:56:38.463]  I know.
[00:56:40.184 --> 00:56:43.684]  We told you what was going to happen and it did.
[00:56:44.085 --> 00:56:51.085]  Now we're telling you what's coming at Real Alex Jones on X.
[00:56:51.085 --> 00:57:03.085]  [Music]
[00:57:03.085 --> 00:57:26.085]  [Music]
[00:57:27.085 --> 00:57:33.085]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[00:57:33.085 --> 00:57:35.085]  1776!
[00:57:35.405 --> 00:57:44.692]  1776!
[00:57:36.646 --> 00:57:44.692]  So this fight for America is key, not just for us, but the entire world.
[00:57:45.252 --> 00:57:58.801]  Because if this republic falls, the entire world falls to the UN and the globalists and their hellish plan to literally take everything you've got, including your children, away from you.
[00:57:58.821 --> 00:58:09.970]   And whether it's Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates or Yuval Noah Harari, They represent the globalist ruling class of the planet who say the future is not human.
[00:58:10.310 --> 00:58:11.931]  Well, we got news for them.
[00:58:12.231 --> 00:58:14.231]  The future is not globalist!
[00:58:14.231 --> 00:58:23.231]  The future is human.
[00:58:23.619 --> 00:58:29.443]  The lies they spread about Alex, they've tried to take him out more than they've tried to take any of us out.
[00:58:30.003 --> 00:58:31.084]  But let me tell you what it is.
[00:58:31.124 --> 00:58:44.054]  What they'll never say is that Alex Jones has spent 30 years being the loudest voice for freedom, for liberty, and for anti-war that this world has seen.
[00:58:44.334 --> 00:58:47.996]  He stood against them, and that's why they're against him.
[00:58:49.518 --> 00:58:56.563]  Well, they have tried to burn him to the ground, but he won't stop fighting!
[00:58:56.603 --> 00:58:58.185]  Let's launch Team Humanity!
[00:59:01.207 --> 00:59:02.488]  Team Humanity!
[00:59:05.351 --> 00:59:06.151]  Team Humanity!
[00:59:08.673 --> 00:59:12.877]  Are you going to let them brainwash and take your children?
[00:59:14.864 --> 00:59:25.131]  The answer to their 1984 anti-human, dehumanization world is humanity coming together and celebrating freedom that God gave us and saying no!
[00:59:25.311 --> 00:59:27.953]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[00:59:28.053 --> 00:59:34.357]  So I have a message to the globalists.
[00:59:35.078 --> 00:59:41.262]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[00:59:44.793 --> 00:59:47.094]  They declared war on us!
[00:59:47.954 --> 00:59:49.015]  They're attacking us!
[00:59:49.355 --> 00:59:50.395]  They're surveilling us!
[00:59:50.735 --> 00:59:51.756]  They're censoring us!
[00:59:52.096 --> 00:59:55.797]  They're cutting off our energy, our water, our communications, our freedom!
[00:59:56.097 --> 01:00:00.539]  We're simply recognizing it and saying, we're not gonna roll over and die!
[01:00:00.999 --> 01:00:06.421]  Our God is the God of the universe that created all, and your little God, Satan, is a loser!
[01:00:06.941 --> 01:00:12.126]  There is a global, worldwide, political realignment against the New World Order.
[01:00:12.447 --> 01:00:22.576]  The New World Order is a couple thousand arrogant people led by King Charles, who sits around and talks about how he wants to depopulate people, and so did his father, Prince Philip.
[01:00:22.937 --> 01:00:28.937]   And I'm telling them right now, we are not rolling over and dying for you inbred globalists.
[01:00:28.937 --> 01:00:31.937]  [Cheering]
[01:00:31.937 --> 01:00:34.937]  You will not divide and conquer us any longer.
[01:00:34.937 --> 01:00:38.937]  And as long as we never give up, we are invincible.
[01:00:38.937 --> 01:00:41.937]  [Cheering]

[01:01:49.066 --> 01:02:02.066]  [Music]
[01:02:02.066 --> 01:02:09.066]   All right, this isn't about tooting our horns here, but with all the huge debate news and the populism exploding,
[01:02:09.066 --> 01:02:14.066]   and what's really happening in Ukraine and China and the border and everything,
[01:02:14.729 --> 01:02:15.830]  He flew down here from D.C.
[01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:24.593]  He had 12.5 million viewers last night just on his main show, tens of millions of views of the clips of he and Charlie Kirk knocking it out of the park.
[01:02:24.613 --> 01:02:28.000]   You go to TV Insider, Nobody watches cable.
[01:02:28.781 --> 01:02:29.521]  3 million people.
[01:02:29.561 --> 01:02:31.701]  That's a record in the last few years for CNN.
[01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:32.322]  Record low.
[01:02:32.902 --> 01:02:36.523]  It's a record low, but record high for their new low.
[01:02:37.043 --> 01:02:39.104]  Their average show has 80-something thousand viewers.
[01:02:39.404 --> 01:02:40.084]  Oh yeah.
[01:02:40.124 --> 01:02:41.044]  So they're dead.
[01:02:41.444 --> 01:02:44.465]  And even with this biggest debate ever, they had 3 million viewers.
[01:02:44.505 --> 01:02:46.566]  Jack Mosevich had 12 and a half million.
[01:02:46.606 --> 01:02:48.806]  We had 4 million altogether.
[01:02:49.146 --> 01:02:54.268]  And there was thousands of folks streaming, which shows that why isn't Trump going and doing a debate?
[01:02:55.068 --> 01:02:58.972]  You know, hosted by Charlie Kirk and Jack Posobiec or Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson or Alex Jones.
[01:02:59.472 --> 01:03:00.933]  That would have a billion views.
[01:03:01.394 --> 01:03:02.535]  That's what people want.
[01:03:02.615 --> 01:03:06.478]  So, CNN, 3 million viewers and change.
[01:03:06.558 --> 01:03:09.520]  Jack Posobiec, 12.5 million historic.
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:13.383]  Jack Posobiec and Charlie Kirk's debate coverage gets 12.5 million views on X.
[01:03:14.224 --> 01:03:15.365]  Legacy Media is dead.
[01:03:15.405 --> 01:03:20.348]  So it's not about keeping score, except it is because they're such a joke.
[01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:24.431]  And they try to threaten everybody not to carry it, but Elon Musk said it's fair use.
[01:03:24.752 --> 01:03:25.092]  They have.
[01:03:25.752 --> 01:03:27.233]  But I wanted to say that first.
[01:03:27.253 --> 01:03:29.535]  You're also going to be co-hosting for the next three hours with me.
[01:03:30.055 --> 01:03:30.576]  Unhumans.
[01:03:31.488 --> 01:03:35.751]  Your new book, The Secret History of Communism as Revolutions, that's what we're facing right now.
[01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:40.675]  They say we're inhuman, and then they dehumanize us, but they're really the unhumans.
[01:03:40.955 --> 01:03:47.761]  We'll be talking about the book, it's already a bestseller, but Jack, wow, huge takeaways from this event we just witnessed.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:52.522]  Well, Alex, and on your debate coverage again, as you just said, and thanks for having me on here today.
[01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:56.944]  And look, it's the team with Charlie Kirk that we put together.
[01:03:56.984 --> 01:03:58.204]  We call the show Thoughtcrime.
[01:03:58.224 --> 01:03:59.305]  We do it every Thursday night.
[01:03:59.325 --> 01:04:00.866]  We've been doing it for about a year now.
[01:04:01.626 --> 01:04:04.267]  We've got Blake, we've got Tyler, we've got Andrew on there.
[01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:06.068]  Caitlin Sinclair joined us at one point.
[01:04:06.788 --> 01:04:08.029]  And look, it's...
[01:04:08.769 --> 01:04:13.413]  It's not just a testament to the downfall of the legacy media.
[01:04:13.473 --> 01:04:20.138]  It's a testament to the fact that people don't want the prescripted corporate narrative anymore.
[01:04:20.458 --> 01:04:24.641]  People want to hear actual opinions from what's going on behind the scenes.
[01:04:24.901 --> 01:04:35.710]  They want to know people who have real opinions, not ones that are plastered to them from the intelligence agencies, not ones that are shifted to them by the corporate oligarchs.
[01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:40.473]   But I will say this, Alex, that is Something that we got last night.
[01:04:40.713 --> 01:04:46.256]  Because if you want to hear the real opinions of real people, then you would watch shows like yours, you would watch shows like ours.
[01:04:46.516 --> 01:04:58.022]  But if you want to hear the response and the freakout and the switch that was flipped, really, I would say about halfway through the debate is when it happened.
[01:04:58.382 --> 01:05:00.663]  That's when they gave Biden the kill switch.
[01:05:01.004 --> 01:05:09.634]   They flipped the kill switch on Biden, then all of a sudden, remember, And that's when they realized that all their gaslighting, that he's a genius, he's wonderful, it all collapsed.
[01:05:09.694 --> 01:05:12.376]  Oh, he's sharp as a tack, he's great, he's great.
[01:05:12.436 --> 01:05:16.600]  And again, it already collapsed in our minds years ago, but they were still believing they could sell us a lie.
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.801]  That collapsed yesterday.
[01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:19.362]  A huge demoralization for them.
[01:05:19.502 --> 01:05:23.607]  But it is, but I would argue it's not a demoralization in another sense.
[01:05:23.927 --> 01:05:32.418]  Because, and I said this on the show, and I would say this is one of the reasons that when we really started picking traction, I said, you're not watching a debate.
[01:05:32.978 --> 01:05:34.400]  You are watching a coup.
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:39.900]  You are watching a Democrat coup of their own candidate.
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:44.380]   That's why the intelligence agencies, and we know the intelligence agencies directly
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:50.460]   got involved in interfering in the last two election cycles, 2016, 2020, vis-a-vis the
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.920]  Steele dossier and the Hunter Biden letter.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:56.259]  Then those were both planned in time for what?
[01:05:56.259 --> 01:05:57.259]  The debate.
[01:05:57.259 --> 01:05:59.641]  They always brought it up at the debate.
[01:05:59.641 --> 01:06:00.940]  So what did we see again?
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:01.940]  We guess what?
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:03.920]  It was another intelligence operation.
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:09.920]   one and to be fair to be fair I don't think a lot of people saw this coming
[01:06:08.295 --> 01:06:10.697]  This one was directed at Biden himself.
[01:06:10.857 --> 01:06:11.218]  No, you're right.
[01:06:11.278 --> 01:06:14.640]  It was a political coup against him.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:15.441]  Quantify that.
[01:06:15.481 --> 01:06:15.681]  Yes.
[01:06:16.041 --> 01:06:19.704]  So this is why you'll see all the same people in many cases.
[01:06:20.144 --> 01:06:27.450]  And, you know, maybe the team and I'm sure the human events team we're going to be asking about putting this together is compilations of people from, you know, Joe Scarborough.
[01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:28.691]  Oh, he's sharp as a tack.
[01:06:28.711 --> 01:06:29.692]  He's sharpest we've ever seen.
[01:06:29.932 --> 01:06:32.314]  So you juxtapose that to Joe Scarborough now.
[01:06:32.654 --> 01:06:36.495]  Well, you know, I think his time is gone and he had a great career.
[01:06:36.855 --> 01:06:41.717]  No, no, that is not you coming to some new revelation just because you watch that.
[01:06:41.797 --> 01:06:42.717]  You spent time with him.
[01:06:42.957 --> 01:06:44.478]  You know what it's like behind the scenes.
[01:06:44.818 --> 01:06:48.839]  Someone is in your ear making the decision in corporate media.
[01:06:48.879 --> 01:06:51.359]  to knife and throw the dagger at Joe Biden.
[01:06:51.359 --> 01:06:55.479]   And there's a number of instances that we can point to that showed this Michelle Obama
[01:06:55.479 --> 01:07:00.238]   coming out before the debate, throwing the dagger at the family, Hillary Clinton announcing
[01:07:00.238 --> 01:07:04.679]   that she is going to be going on a new public relations tour, that she's got a book coming
[01:07:04.679 --> 01:07:07.379]  out, she's making surprise appearances again.
[01:07:07.379 --> 01:07:11.078]   It's very clear that this has been in the works for some time now.
[01:07:11.078 --> 01:07:17.379]   But the switch that was flipped was the entire mainstream media all of a sudden turning on
[01:07:17.379 --> 01:07:19.619]  Biden guns blazing.
[01:07:19.423 --> 01:07:31.293]  And what you're seeing now play out is a factional, oligarchic civil war inside the Democrat Party because they don't have the ability to dislodge him very easily.
[01:07:31.533 --> 01:07:32.514]  So you know what's going on.
[01:07:32.734 --> 01:07:34.015]  This is like death of Stalin.
[01:07:34.155 --> 01:07:40.155]   This is, do we let the people know that the leader is dead or will we be thrown in the gulags?
[01:07:40.155 --> 01:07:42.155]   They don't care about Biden, but you know what they care about?
[01:07:42.155 --> 01:07:46.855]   They care about Merrick Garland, they care about the lawfare, they care about Matt Graves,
[01:07:46.855 --> 01:07:50.155]   they care about the fact that if they come out, then maybe they're going to be the ones
[01:07:50.155 --> 01:07:52.955]  that get the lawfare launched against them.
[01:07:52.955 --> 01:07:56.755]  This is the situation we're in. It's incredibly dangerous.
[01:07:56.847 --> 01:07:59.228]  We don't know which side is going to fire first.
[01:07:59.288 --> 01:08:00.229]  And so Trump did great.
[01:08:00.489 --> 01:08:01.069]  Don't get me wrong.
[01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:02.369]  And we could talk about that as well.
[01:08:02.609 --> 01:08:07.051]  But I think what I see from the power structure is absolute chaos.
[01:08:07.291 --> 01:08:15.793]  And this is when the most brutal, the most brutal and ruthless thugs and dictators, which by the way, is how Stalin got in power in the first place.
[01:08:16.174 --> 01:08:17.514]  This is when they rise to power.
[01:08:17.714 --> 01:08:23.840]  No, I totally agree with you that we shouldn't just focus on the positive things that happened, but what the establishment is really trying.
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:25.261]  It's obviously a coup against Biden.
[01:08:25.802 --> 01:08:29.806]  They knew he was marching up there to be destroyed, and that happened.
[01:08:29.846 --> 01:08:32.208]  But in a larger issue, they tried to prop him up.
[01:08:32.748 --> 01:08:35.431]  It's so discrediting, not of Biden, but of the system.
[01:08:35.871 --> 01:08:37.533]  As you said, we've got to put a compilation.
[01:08:37.573 --> 01:08:38.474]  Have McBrain do it right now.
[01:08:38.494 --> 01:08:39.174]  It'll be done in an hour.
[01:08:39.455 --> 01:08:43.178]   Just a basic one of them saying, We already played the compilation last week.
[01:08:43.258 --> 01:08:44.279]  Oh, Biden's the smartest.
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:45.300]  He's the greatest.
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:45.861]  He's the best.
[01:08:45.901 --> 01:08:46.381]  He's a genius.
[01:08:46.962 --> 01:08:48.804]  Now the same people, he's the biggest idiot ever.
[01:08:49.264 --> 01:08:52.047]  What I'm saying is it is a defeat of the establishment.
[01:08:52.427 --> 01:08:58.233]  They think they can reorganize deck chairs and bring in Big Mike, who again stabbed Biden in the back before the debate last night.
[01:08:58.253 --> 01:08:58.914]  You're absolutely right.
[01:08:59.294 --> 01:09:02.097]  But that's not going to work because people now see it as one group.
[01:09:02.861 --> 01:09:05.122]  Well Alex, think about it this way too.
[01:09:05.162 --> 01:09:22.371]  The same people who say that they are fighting for democracy, that they want democracy to win, that they are fighting against Trump for democracy, are now also openly telling you that they want to replace the candidate that their own voters actually put in office in the primaries.
[01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:33.260]  So, sorry to all the other Democrat candidates and the RFKs and the Greens and the Cordell Wests, because, no, they're telling you up front, we decide who our candidate is.
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:37.343]  Not you, not the people, and if we want to get rid of him, we're going to get rid of him.
[01:09:37.383 --> 01:09:42.447]  And this is a continuation of not letting there be Democrat debates, blocking the other candidates.
[01:09:42.707 --> 01:09:44.649]  And then, what were they thinking all along?
[01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:46.791]  Biden was brain dead four years ago, eight years ago.
[01:09:47.191 --> 01:09:48.012]  Why did they try this?
[01:09:48.712 --> 01:09:53.613]  Look, they wanted, and I've been reporting on this for years, they've been trying to dislodge Biden.
[01:09:53.873 --> 01:10:08.616]  Kamala Harris, and don't tell me for a second that Kamala Harris wasn't fully prepared with, she's got the suit, the dark suit, she's got the shaping, she's got the framing of the American flag hanging down there.
[01:10:09.036 --> 01:10:16.158]  She was designed, she and her team designed that appearance to have the presidential aesthetic.
[01:10:16.398 --> 01:10:19.660]   Now, she didn't say yet That she wants to take over.
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:24.645]  She didn't say anything about taking over but she designed it that way on purpose.
[01:10:24.865 --> 01:10:30.591]  There's a reason, by the way, that Kamala Harris was not there last night.
[01:10:30.671 --> 01:10:31.372]  Think about this.
[01:10:31.752 --> 01:10:32.653]  She was not there.
[01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:33.775]  Gavin Newsom was there.
[01:10:34.275 --> 01:10:34.475]  Right?
[01:10:34.755 --> 01:10:36.096]  So many other Democrats were there.
[01:10:36.216 --> 01:10:38.658]  Kamala Harris stayed in D.C.
[01:10:39.038 --> 01:10:56.249]  because she wanted to show that she was the one who could potentially take the reins, because she knew there's been a shade war in the entire White House since day one of their crooked regime, and now that shade war has blown out into the open in a full-on Democrat civil war.
[01:10:56.750 --> 01:11:00.932]  So there's no honor amongst thieves, and that's the thing.
[01:11:00.973 --> 01:11:02.974]  People ask, well, who is the new nominee?
[01:11:04.164 --> 01:11:06.225]  Going to be, and the answer is they're all battling.
[01:11:06.505 --> 01:11:16.048]  Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton, Big Mike, Gavin Newsom, with all their other little weird camps, which puts them totally off balance 129 days out from the election.
[01:11:17.749 --> 01:11:18.689]  They got a big problem.
[01:11:18.729 --> 01:11:20.030]  Will they be able to steal this from Trump?
[01:11:21.038 --> 01:11:24.983]  Well, Alex, there's a lot of things that can happen between now and the election.
[01:11:25.864 --> 01:11:37.579]  And honestly, the biggest thing on my mind, and I was texting you about this last night, I was texting Steve Bannon and telling everybody, I said, why does Biden keep bringing up Article 5 of NATO?
[01:11:37.819 --> 01:11:39.100]  This is the most important takeaway.
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:40.241]  Explain what Article 5 is.
[01:11:40.361 --> 01:11:48.828]  And Article 5 means, and he said it on the debate stage, and just completely unprovoked, right?
[01:11:48.928 --> 01:11:49.408]  Unprovoked.
[01:11:49.448 --> 01:11:50.909]  No one had been talking about NATO.
[01:11:51.009 --> 01:11:51.830]  It was his ace card.
[01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:54.112]  Every time Trump kicked his ass, he pulled out nuclear war.
[01:11:54.152 --> 01:11:55.153]  He would say nuclear war.
[01:11:55.453 --> 01:11:55.753]  Article 5.
[01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:57.775]  Attack on one is attack on all.
[01:11:57.795 --> 01:11:59.396]  And attack on one is attack on all.
[01:11:59.716 --> 01:12:03.997]  And Trump is over there saying, I want to de-escalate, I want to try to get to a peace deal, I want to offer him.
[01:12:04.037 --> 01:12:08.119]  By the way, Zelensky is over at the NATO Summit right now, and he's talking about settlement.
[01:12:08.399 --> 01:12:09.899]  Even Zelensky is talking about it.
[01:12:09.919 --> 01:12:10.579]  That was my next point.
[01:12:10.659 --> 01:12:12.420]  How big is it, Zelensky, just today?
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:13.520]  We have the video.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.621]  Ukraine does not want a prolonged war, they want to end it in two months.
[01:12:16.961 --> 01:12:18.862]  Sounds like they know the writing on the wall.
[01:12:19.002 --> 01:12:19.662]  Look, he knows.
[01:12:19.923 --> 01:12:21.363]  He knows that he's running out of men.
[01:12:21.423 --> 01:12:23.365]  He knows he's running out of military age men.
[01:12:23.625 --> 01:12:25.706]  He knows that they're the only force.
[01:12:25.746 --> 01:12:33.731]  And Alex, what have you and I been saying every single time that we've had one of these conversations going back six months, going back 10 months?
[01:12:34.031 --> 01:12:41.736]  The only way to prolong this war is the arrival of NATO, the arrival of NATO into the conflict.
[01:12:41.976 --> 01:12:48.120]  And then you tie that back to what was Joe Biden saying multiple times, unprovoked throughout the debate.
[01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:52.100]   I'm the commander in chief, I'm holding you hostage with a gun to your head.
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:56.420]   So what do you make, how big is it to have the leader of Hungary or Bonn, Viktor, coming
[01:12:56.420 --> 01:13:01.059]   out and saying, this is hopeless, I'm going to leave NATO if this continues.
[01:13:01.059 --> 01:13:02.059]  That is huge.
[01:13:02.059 --> 01:13:07.420]   Look, you're seeing the desperate rats trapped in the corner.
[01:13:07.821 --> 01:13:09.363]  That's Joe Biden right now.
[01:13:09.623 --> 01:13:11.144]  Zelensky's waving the white flag.
[01:13:11.525 --> 01:13:13.266]  Zelensky's up there waving the white flag.
[01:13:13.286 --> 01:13:14.767]  His military is collapsing.
[01:13:15.568 --> 01:13:17.490]  They have already collapsed.
[01:13:17.530 --> 01:13:18.551]  That's why they're conscripting.
[01:13:18.571 --> 01:13:21.494]  By the way, imagine you're one of these poor Ukrainians.
[01:13:22.014 --> 01:13:22.915]  You've got the kids.
[01:13:23.195 --> 01:13:29.641]  And then you've got the elderly that they're now sending into the trenches to have Russian artillery rain down on them.
[01:13:30.141 --> 01:13:37.708]  And these FPV drones with IEDs attached to them flying up and blowing apart people left and right next to you.
[01:13:37.748 --> 01:13:40.390]  And then you say, well, at least Joe Biden's got my back.
[01:13:40.690 --> 01:13:43.633]  At least the United States with Joe Biden at the helm's got the back.
[01:13:43.893 --> 01:13:49.538]  And then maybe if you catch a little Wi-Fi or catch a little signal, you see a piece of the debate and you go, wait a minute.
[01:13:49.978 --> 01:13:52.341]  That's the guy that we bet everything on.
[01:13:52.621 --> 01:13:54.764]  That's the guy that I bet my children's future on.
[01:13:55.004 --> 01:14:02.632]  That's the guy that's the reason that they have to dig up the bodies of the of the victims of the last war to re to extend this.
[01:14:02.653 --> 01:14:07.916]   So Biden is holding everybody hostage with the threat of nuclear He's holding them hostage with the threat of nuclear war, Alex.
[01:14:08.096 --> 01:14:10.517]  And I said this on the stream last night, and I'll say it again.
[01:14:10.817 --> 01:14:12.077]  They are going to be desperate.
[01:14:12.338 --> 01:14:13.498]  They know that they looked weak.
[01:14:13.758 --> 01:14:16.859]  He wants to, he wants to, quote unquote, project strength.
[01:14:17.239 --> 01:14:18.240]  I need to look strong.
[01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:21.261]  I need to show the world that I'm still strong, that I'm still tough.
[01:14:21.281 --> 01:14:21.921]  So what do you do?
[01:14:22.421 --> 01:14:25.542]  What do you do if you have control of the nuclear arsenal?
[01:14:25.782 --> 01:14:27.182]  If you have control of the U.S.
[01:14:27.222 --> 01:14:27.663]  military?
[01:14:27.683 --> 01:14:28.943]  If you have control of NATO?
[01:14:29.103 --> 01:14:32.124]  You're already in a proxy war with Russia.
[01:14:32.404 --> 01:14:35.665]  You're already looking at escalations with Taiwan.
[01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:46.148]  You've already got Israel now talking about an imminent, imminently... It sounds like Hitler losing in North Africa so he can't beat the British so he turns against Russia.
[01:14:46.468 --> 01:14:48.448]  It just smacks of total insanity.
[01:14:48.909 --> 01:14:49.269]  And so...
[01:14:50.649 --> 01:15:19.377]   Biden is now telling us, and this is the sense that I got through the debate, that Biden was telling us again and again and again that he wasn't warning of World War III, he was threatening World War III to save his own hide, to save his own skin, certainly to save his son, who is up to his ears in the very regime that provoked the war to begin with.
[01:15:19.678 --> 01:15:21.319]  It's all intrinsically.
[01:15:21.359 --> 01:15:32.168]  So the question is, is the inbred degenerate lawyers, the Harvard mafia that runs DC, are, do they get like, they're literally Hitler in 44, they're about to lose?
[01:15:33.308 --> 01:15:35.909]  And the General Staff trying to get rid of Hitler because they can sue for peace.
[01:15:35.929 --> 01:15:38.331]  Or are they going to just push all the way to total destruction?
[01:15:38.371 --> 01:15:39.791]  Because you've lost.
[01:15:39.811 --> 01:15:40.852]  I mean, that's what I told the globalists.
[01:15:41.272 --> 01:15:42.492]  You've lost right now.
[01:15:42.572 --> 01:15:44.953]  You could probably kill all of us, including yourselves.
[01:15:45.354 --> 01:15:48.135]  But the smart thing is, we'll put you on an island like Napoleon.
[01:15:48.535 --> 01:15:49.495]  Give up now.
[01:15:49.635 --> 01:15:50.456]  We've beaten you.
[01:15:51.192 --> 01:15:51.892]  You can go to Elba.
[01:15:52.412 --> 01:15:53.073]  More than happy.
[01:15:53.553 --> 01:15:55.814]  You can all go to Elba, and you can stay there.
[01:15:56.134 --> 01:15:58.275]  Joe Biden, you can go to Rehoboth.
[01:15:58.495 --> 01:16:00.475]  Your son, he'll have to do some time.
[01:16:00.575 --> 01:16:02.256]  I'm sorry, that just is what it is.
[01:16:02.636 --> 01:16:05.277]  Jill Biden, by the way, is the one we should be addressing.
[01:16:05.497 --> 01:16:07.758]  Because we all saw the videos after this.
[01:16:08.138 --> 01:16:11.200]  This is the national security crisis and constitutional crisis.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.261]  It's the same as the FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt.
[01:16:13.481 --> 01:16:15.021]  It's the same thing with Wilson at the end.
[01:16:15.242 --> 01:16:20.064]  What FDR, when they wheel him into Yalta, and he's surrounded by Alger Hiss and all the Soviet spies.
[01:16:20.084 --> 01:16:21.244]  We actually talk about that in the book.
[01:16:21.685 --> 01:16:25.006]  And then Eleanor Roosevelt was the one running the show.
[01:16:25.306 --> 01:16:26.907]  Now you got Dr. Jill.
[01:16:27.227 --> 01:16:31.189]  Dr. Jill from Jersey is the one who's running the show.
[01:16:31.289 --> 01:16:32.290]  And she's refusing to go.
[01:16:32.890 --> 01:16:34.111]  And she's refusing to go.
[01:16:34.351 --> 01:16:36.092]  She's refusing to let Joe Biden go.
[01:16:36.172 --> 01:16:42.234]  She's refusing to even let him acknowledge, by the way, his own granddaughter, Navy Joan, with London Roberts.
[01:16:42.615 --> 01:16:44.916]  She is the one calling the shots.
[01:16:44.956 --> 01:16:55.761]  It's very clear from everyone who saw this last night, she was handling him like a kindergartner, walking him around saying, by the way, Alex, I don't even think he realizes that he lost.
[01:16:56.161 --> 01:16:59.843]  Remember, she's telling him, she's over there telling him, oh you answered all the questions, Joe!
[01:17:00.483 --> 01:17:04.345]  You answered all the questions, you did a good job, here's a little ice cream cone.
[01:17:04.365 --> 01:17:06.286]  She treats him like a retarded puppy.
[01:17:07.006 --> 01:17:11.248]  She treats him like, I mean, just, she treats him like a special needs kid.
[01:17:12.209 --> 01:17:13.369]  There's no other way to say that.
[01:17:13.489 --> 01:17:14.910]  And he responds to her like that.
[01:17:15.170 --> 01:17:20.113]  And he is responding to her without, oh I did a good job, I did a good job.
[01:17:20.173 --> 01:17:22.854]  And look at her, she can see her in these videos, she's the president now.
[01:17:23.434 --> 01:17:24.554]  She's the one in charge.
[01:17:24.655 --> 01:17:26.135]  It's Jill Biden in the pantsuit.
[01:17:26.395 --> 01:17:30.777]  Jill Biden- Well, she, like, struts off planes in, like, hooker outfits and black fishnets.
[01:17:31.337 --> 01:17:33.358]  And she's the one who's in there.
[01:17:33.418 --> 01:17:55.986]   And so what you really have, because she's not actually smart enough to actually run any of these things, so you've got all the oligarchs, you've got the national security state that's running wild, you've got the Department of Justice that's running wild with Wray and Garland, you've got Tony Blinken, and up until recently, and probably a little bit behind the scenes, who, Vicky Newland, Over at the Department of State, Lloyd Austin checked, totally checked out at the Pentagon.
[01:17:56.446 --> 01:17:58.347]  This is mass insanity.
[01:17:58.667 --> 01:18:01.168]  We are being run by un-humans.
[01:18:01.488 --> 01:18:09.211]  And so people need to understand that this cabal will do anything to save their own skin.
[01:18:09.471 --> 01:18:12.913]  We're in a very dangerous moment right now.
[01:18:12.973 --> 01:18:16.934]  And I know people said, watching the debate, and rah, rah, and Trump did fantastic.
[01:18:16.954 --> 01:18:17.875]  It was command performance.
[01:18:17.935 --> 01:18:19.335]  Command performance by Donald Trump.
[01:18:19.495 --> 01:18:20.716]  It was the best debate performance.
[01:18:20.936 --> 01:18:23.177]  But Biden has got a gun to our head with nuclear war.
[01:18:23.197 --> 01:18:29.819]  Biden's got his finger, his decrepit finger on the trigger, and Jill Biden's hand is the one that might push it down.
[01:18:29.899 --> 01:18:30.359]  Well, that's right.
[01:18:30.399 --> 01:18:34.541]  And just because we haven't had nuclear war yet, I see the comments on X, oh, but there hasn't been a nuclear war yet.
[01:18:34.861 --> 01:18:36.842]  Yeah, because we barely stopped it over and over again.
[01:18:37.322 --> 01:18:39.243]  All the top analysts agree we've never been closer.
[01:18:39.643 --> 01:18:43.384]  People better take this damn serious, like the open border and the collapsing currency.
[01:18:43.404 --> 01:18:44.665]  Well, that's nothing compared to this.
[01:18:45.025 --> 01:18:47.886]  People better get serious because this is serious.
[01:18:49.704 --> 01:18:51.486]  There's no question in my mind, Alex.
[01:18:51.986 --> 01:18:54.429]  He was bringing up, and remember, he had the earpiece.
[01:18:54.869 --> 01:18:55.830]  He had the earpiece.
[01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:57.171]  He kept doing this.
[01:18:57.812 --> 01:19:09.644]  That's why he kept leaning over, because he's listening, and they're saying, Article 5, Article 5, Joe, Article 5, remember, Article 5, NATO, NATO, remember NATO, nuclear war, nuclear, and Trump's sitting there going, what are you talking about?
[01:19:09.924 --> 01:19:10.945]  I want to de-escalate.
[01:19:10.965 --> 01:19:15.749]   Zelensky wants to For people that don't know, they have little earpieces, they don't even have wires, they're wireless, they put it in the ear.
[01:19:15.869 --> 01:19:16.649]  It's wireless.
[01:19:16.749 --> 01:19:21.612]  It goes right into the ear, and so whoever's on the other end of that earpiece, that's the real president.
[01:19:21.912 --> 01:19:23.453]  That's the real person who's in power.
[01:19:23.714 --> 01:19:24.454]  That's the real person.
[01:19:24.474 --> 01:19:25.535]  So what's wrong with those people?
[01:19:25.555 --> 01:19:31.338]  Because you can look at this, if you're geopolitically savvy at any level, and see we're being led into total destruction.
[01:19:31.639 --> 01:19:32.359]  So who are, Obama?
[01:19:32.399 --> 01:19:33.460]  Who is on the line?
[01:19:37.282 --> 01:19:50.930]  Alex, remember, both world wars that we've experienced all began because of encroaching and entangling alliances that kicked off with flashpoints in Eastern and Southeastern Europe.
[01:19:54.052 --> 01:19:57.894]  250 years ago was against entangling alliances because he knew that's how the war started then.
[01:19:58.114 --> 01:19:58.294]  Right.
[01:19:58.594 --> 01:20:03.516]  And so we look at NATO and in the United States we say, oh, NATO is this great thing.
[01:20:03.576 --> 01:20:04.696]  It's this wonderful alliance.
[01:20:04.736 --> 01:20:05.896]  It keeps everybody safe.
[01:20:06.477 --> 01:20:12.999]  And yet Joe Biden himself is up there again and again and again through the earpiece.
[01:20:13.339 --> 01:20:18.221]  Whoever's on the other side of that earpiece is telling him, threaten them with nuclear war.
[01:20:18.641 --> 01:20:20.203]  Threaten them with nuclear war.
[01:20:20.262 --> 01:20:23.863]  he is threatening to incinerate the planet.
[01:20:23.863 --> 01:20:27.622]   Well, remember what Von Ruppe 10 years ago, the head of the EU said when the EU was breaking up,
[01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:31.021]  he said, "If you try to end Europe, we'll just start a war."
[01:20:31.021 --> 01:20:31.222]  Yes.
[01:20:31.222 --> 01:20:31.903]  That's their thing.
[01:20:31.903 --> 01:20:32.462]  We'll start a war.
[01:20:32.462 --> 01:20:33.702]  How's that sound?
[01:20:33.702 --> 01:20:36.143]   Because NATO, anytime it wants to go start a war with Russia.
[01:20:36.143 --> 01:20:40.301]   And Alex, you and I have said so many times, we said this is the biggest threat
[01:20:40.301 --> 01:20:42.342]   because the biggest threat will be suddenly there's going to...
[01:20:42.342 --> 01:20:43.301]  And they try it all the time.
[01:20:43.301 --> 01:20:44.301]  They try it all the time.
[01:20:44.301 --> 01:20:48.742]   They're going to say, "Oh, somebody bombed a hospital and look, it was Russians.
[01:20:48.742 --> 01:20:50.742]  and somebody bombed this thing in Europe.
[01:20:50.742 --> 01:20:52.742]  And missiles got shot into Poland.
[01:20:52.557 --> 01:21:10.288]  Poland and we think that was the Russians too and then something comes and all of a sudden all it takes is one operation and the New York Times already admitted that the CIA has 13 bases along the border whatever was the previous border between Russia and Ukraine.
[01:21:10.328 --> 01:21:12.269]  And Newland admitted they're bioweapon labs too.
[01:21:12.609 --> 01:21:20.435]  She, well she, remember, and it was Rubio, to his credit, your best friend Rubio, asking him, asking her actually, do you have bioweapons labs?
[01:21:20.455 --> 01:21:28.182]  She goes, we have research facilities into biological weapons programs, but they are not laboratories.
[01:21:28.222 --> 01:21:32.485]  And it's just totally, totally, you know, she's in the mumble tank on that one.
[01:21:32.625 --> 01:21:33.525]  No, she's admitting it.
[01:21:33.605 --> 01:21:36.907]  She's admitting the biological weapon stockpiles in Ukraine.
[01:21:36.927 --> 01:21:38.187]  That's exactly what that was.
[01:21:38.567 --> 01:21:47.091]  And so, they know that all of these things are out there, so all of a sudden it's, oops, you know, a bioweapon got loose and it was the Russians' fault.
[01:21:47.391 --> 01:21:47.671]  Oops.
[01:21:48.131 --> 01:21:52.613]  Or, God forbid, they use a tactical nuke and they blame it on Russia.
[01:21:52.673 --> 01:21:54.754]  They use a dirty bomb and they blame it on Russia.
[01:21:55.034 --> 01:22:05.480]  They could do any number of things, and what they will do, Alex, is they will cast Russia as being the aggressor against the world stage, they will bring back... They've already done it!
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:08.081]  They're going to expand it.
[01:22:08.161 --> 01:22:10.403]  They'll expand it, is what I mean, and they will...
[01:22:11.323 --> 01:22:26.752]  They will then tie that to Russia collusion, which is already their narrative, and they will say, all the Republicans, and the Jack Posobics, and the Alex Jones, and the Steve Bannon's, and the Tucker Carlson's, and the people who just say they want peace, and they don't want to end humanity, well, you're on the side of the Democrats.
[01:22:26.772 --> 01:22:27.092]  Exactly.
[01:22:27.132 --> 01:22:27.492]  This is key.
[01:22:27.532 --> 01:22:28.253]  Let's just slow down.
[01:22:28.273 --> 01:22:29.433]  This is so important what you're saying.
[01:22:29.494 --> 01:22:30.114]  It's so dead on.
[01:22:30.134 --> 01:22:31.094]  That's why I love you, Jack.
[01:22:31.435 --> 01:22:32.615]  You're the smartest guy on this.
[01:22:33.256 --> 01:22:34.797]  All this pre-programming makes no sense.
[01:22:34.837 --> 01:22:35.697]  We're all Russians.
[01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:38.479]  You want to own guns, control the border, and have a good dollar?
[01:22:39.099 --> 01:22:44.044]  They don't care, because once they start the full war, that's the pretext with the FEMA camps and the martial law.
[01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:45.485]  And it will make sense once they've done it.
[01:22:45.666 --> 01:22:48.709]  Yeah, once they've done it, you are on the wrong side of history.
[01:22:48.949 --> 01:22:52.633]  And once you're on that side, it becomes, oh, you're a suspected Russian agent.
[01:22:52.713 --> 01:22:55.756]  Anyone who's a suspected Russian agent, then the order goes out under martial law.
[01:22:55.776 --> 01:22:59.219]  Which, by the way, Ukraine is currently under martial law right now.
[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:00.380]  He's unelected now.
[01:23:01.101 --> 01:23:08.688]  His term ended, and so we're fighting for democracy to prop up a guy who was not in a democratically elected legal term as president.
[01:23:08.948 --> 01:23:14.513]  And so under their martial law, and people can go and view, everyone's seen the videos on the early parts of the war.
[01:23:14.773 --> 01:23:25.143]  If you're a suspected collaborator, a suspected collaborator, by the way, you're not brought into a courtroom where you have a defense lawyer and adjudication.
[01:23:25.163 --> 01:23:26.304]  You're taken out and shot.
[01:23:26.784 --> 01:23:32.507]  No, you get rolled up by the Azov battalion, you get rolled up by the hit squads, and what do you think are going to do that?
[01:23:32.547 --> 01:23:41.352]  You're going to see Antifa then, here in the United States, would be activated as anti-Russian brigades operating throughout the United States.
[01:23:41.372 --> 01:23:42.893]  By the way, folks, we're not just saying this.
[01:23:42.933 --> 01:23:44.073]  This is happening now.
[01:23:44.153 --> 01:23:45.454]  This is not our opinion.
[01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:48.476]  This is the crazy play they've set up the whole time.
[01:23:49.316 --> 01:23:51.217]  Hillary was supposed to already be in.
[01:23:51.477 --> 01:23:52.618]  This was already supposed to happen.
[01:23:53.038 --> 01:23:54.459]  And then if you're anti-war, you get arrested.
[01:23:54.499 --> 01:23:55.280]  And I'll throw a name out.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.221]  I'll throw a name out.
[01:23:56.521 --> 01:23:59.184]  If you don't believe me, go ask Gonzalo Lira.
[01:24:00.025 --> 01:24:05.790]  Go ask Gonzalo Lira, the YouTuber who stayed behind in Ukraine, who spoke out against Zelensky.
[01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:06.991]  He tried to get out.
[01:24:07.051 --> 01:24:08.512]  They locked him up as a...
[01:24:09.522 --> 01:24:10.163]  Knock, knock, knock.
[01:24:10.183 --> 01:24:11.164]  Stay there, stay there, stay there.
[01:24:11.204 --> 01:24:12.326]  Let's come back and talk about this.
[01:24:12.406 --> 01:24:14.028]  Everybody wants to celebrate the debate.
[01:24:14.208 --> 01:24:14.529]  Great.
[01:24:14.949 --> 01:24:16.872]  But how is the empire going to strike back?
[01:24:16.912 --> 01:24:17.953]  Jack Posobiec is our guest.
[01:24:18.354 --> 01:24:20.036]  Twelve and a half million viewers last night.
[01:24:20.076 --> 01:24:21.198]  Congratulations, Jack Posobiec.
[01:24:21.218 --> 01:24:22.079]  We're going to break it today.
[01:24:22.199 --> 01:24:23.381]  It's been sold out for a while.
[01:24:23.621 --> 01:24:26.123]   It is pure Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[01:24:26.283 --> 01:24:27.284]  It's so hard to make.
[01:24:27.344 --> 01:24:33.167]  You've got to have DEA-approved labs that do it, and it takes months and months to break it down in this special patented process.
[01:24:33.727 --> 01:24:35.788]  Nobody else has true nascent iodine.
[01:24:36.129 --> 01:24:41.772]  They put it on the label, but it's still bound to other elements, and it's not fully absorbable by the cells.
[01:24:41.932 --> 01:24:42.792]  It's the missing link.
[01:24:42.912 --> 01:24:47.535]  Even the UN estimates 2 plus billion people have cognitive disabilities because of iodine deficiency.
[01:24:47.655 --> 01:24:51.457]  Up until the 30s, we had major IQ reduction because of lack of iodine in the U.S.
[01:24:51.477 --> 01:24:53.298]   food supply, especially in the U.S.
[01:24:53.398 --> 01:24:58.619]  Midwest, from the 30s to the early 80s, the government put crappy iodine in the salt by law.
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.500]  And IQs went up 15 points on average.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:02.980]  Burton effects went way down.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.581]  Then in the early 80s, they took it out again.
[01:25:04.701 --> 01:25:08.602]  This is the Deep Earth Crystal Pure, meaning atomic, on the atomic table.
[01:25:08.782 --> 01:25:11.302]  And it goes into the cells at a cellular level.

[01:25:22.225 --> 01:25:25.626]  Now, folks, I want you to listen to me very, very carefully.
[01:25:25.646 --> 01:25:29.126]  I know we've got millions of viewers, millions of folks listening on talk radio.
[01:25:29.547 --> 01:25:31.027]  You've got the power, you can change this.
[01:25:31.107 --> 01:25:33.907]  Jack, I've known Jack for eight years, nine years.
[01:25:34.648 --> 01:25:37.788]  Naval intelligence, a lot of great connections and great work with the Trump campaign.
[01:25:37.808 --> 01:25:39.289]  Years, yeah, it's been eight years, that's right.
[01:25:39.689 --> 01:25:44.470]  You know what you're doing, and of all the analysts I have on, you've been the most accurate geopolitically.
[01:25:44.970 --> 01:25:47.670]   People that don't know history, Well, you're doomed to repeat it.
[01:25:48.231 --> 01:25:49.733]  I know most of you do, but let me explain something.
[01:25:50.414 --> 01:25:56.422]  Any empire in its death throes launches wars to get control over the central empire, even if it's going to destroy them.
[01:25:57.395 --> 01:26:00.137]  And so, when Hitler started losing in World War II, he attacks Russia.
[01:26:00.637 --> 01:26:02.118]  I mean, what's that about?
[01:26:02.778 --> 01:26:04.900]  So, why did Napoleon go into Russia?
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:09.622]  It's the same story over and over and over again.
[01:26:09.662 --> 01:26:11.524]  History doesn't just repeat, it rhymes.
[01:26:12.124 --> 01:26:14.505]  And so, re-state what you said.
[01:26:14.525 --> 01:26:23.972]   I know most people heard you say it twice, but very slowly, Biden signaled, literally going to the earpiece, he was like, And Trump's like, what are you doing?
[01:26:24.072 --> 01:26:24.453]  Hold on.
[01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:26.576]  Article 5, Article 5.
[01:26:26.616 --> 01:26:27.878]  You attack one, you attack all.
[01:26:27.918 --> 01:26:28.680]  War with Russia.
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:31.324]  I mean, they're literally holding a gun to our head.
[01:26:32.386 --> 01:26:34.068]  You cannot overstate this.
[01:26:34.509 --> 01:26:36.312]  So there's this celebration going on.
[01:26:36.372 --> 01:26:37.193]  Trump destroyed him.
[01:26:38.462 --> 01:26:39.463]  It was a coup against Biden.
[01:26:40.103 --> 01:26:41.344]  They've decided to get rid of him.
[01:26:42.064 --> 01:26:43.305]  It means they're going to their next plan.
[01:26:43.345 --> 01:26:44.445]  And yes, it weakens them.
[01:26:44.586 --> 01:26:45.506]  Yes, they're discredited.
[01:26:45.986 --> 01:26:51.790]  And I'm trying to speak to the Dana Bashes, who husband, you know, ran the whole 51 intelligence people.
[01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:58.073]  They need to know, look, guys, I'm not a globalist like you, but let me speak to you like I was one.
[01:26:59.234 --> 01:27:07.299]  In late 1943, early 44, the Nazis, who were warmongers, evil people, tried to kill Hitler with Operation Valkyrie because they could see they were going to lose.
[01:27:08.345 --> 01:27:12.106]  Now I'm not saying kill Biden, he's just a puppet, but kill your own political idea.
[01:27:12.566 --> 01:27:13.967]  You need to back off this.
[01:27:14.087 --> 01:27:14.927]  You will not win.
[01:27:14.987 --> 01:27:21.909]  You'll be in the Reich Chancellery, you'll be in the bunker, literally with the Russians again, 5 million of them coming down your neck.
[01:27:22.289 --> 01:27:25.550]  This is not going to go anywhere but in thermal nuclear war.
[01:27:26.010 --> 01:27:28.491]  You think you built bunkers everywhere like Zuckerberg's done.
[01:27:28.831 --> 01:27:31.712]  Everybody's going to come there for the food once there's a nuclear war.
[01:27:31.912 --> 01:27:32.472]  Stop it!
[01:27:33.172 --> 01:27:38.422]  I know you're lawyers and you think you can hide responsibility and give us poison shots and we're all dumb.
[01:27:38.562 --> 01:27:39.464]  No, we were asleep.
[01:27:39.524 --> 01:27:40.145]  We're not dumb.
[01:27:40.586 --> 01:27:43.231]  And so they will lose down every path.
[01:27:44.366 --> 01:28:07.842]  But surrendering, and I'm serious, and I don't know how that surrender looks, Jack, you can speak to that, but speak to the thermal nuclear war that's on the table, any other plans they've got, civil war they're trying to stir up, race war, if Trump does get elected, which I think he will, they're going to pull a bunch of stuff in the 79 days between his inauguration, the second 79 days of hell that I called four years ago, I mean this is going down, this is go hour.
[01:28:10.393 --> 01:28:12.553]  This is now, it's two-fold.
[01:28:12.973 --> 01:28:21.735]  So you mentioned the final stages of World War II, the final stages of the Third Reich, and how they went and became increasingly more and more desperate.
[01:28:22.015 --> 01:28:37.758]  They started, and just like you see in Ukraine now, by the way, the arming of the young, the arming of the infirm, the arming of the elderly, we're going to keep going, and you had the leader out there making these speeches as if everything was fine, making these speeches as if everything was, and it wasn't, you know, the allies...
[01:28:37.778 --> 01:28:43.858]   Bob. The allies are bombing the cities, Dresden is completely up in flames, and the Red Army
[01:28:43.858 --> 01:28:48.418]   is marching all the way across the east, which was Stalin's plan from the start, by the way.
[01:28:48.418 --> 01:28:52.898]   That Stalin always wanted to take over all of Europe through all of communism. And so
[01:28:52.898 --> 01:28:55.858]  that way, and he cuts out, he ends World War II, by the way.
[01:28:55.858 --> 01:29:00.938]   This is totally tangent here, but Stalin comes out of World War II with an empire from
[01:29:00.938 --> 01:29:03.538]  Berlin to Beijing under communism.
[01:29:03.610 --> 01:29:06.771]  So that's what that war ended up with.
[01:29:07.171 --> 01:29:10.473]  And Hitler, going along with the fight, paved the way.
[01:29:10.913 --> 01:29:20.257]  You've got a fifth of the world's population under the jackboot of godless atheist communism because of the role that Stalin played in World War II and the way that he...
[01:29:20.657 --> 01:29:22.737]  completely played the allies.
[01:29:22.737 --> 01:29:29.297]   And so guess what, boys and girls, Joe Biden is getting played right now by the globalists.
[01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:30.817]  Do you understand?
[01:29:30.817 --> 01:29:32.617]  They're the ones who are in charge.
[01:29:32.617 --> 01:29:38.617]   They're the ones who are ultimately putting that word in his earpiece to say, Article
[01:29:38.617 --> 01:29:41.855]  5, Article 5, an attack on one is an attack on all.
[01:29:41.855 --> 01:29:45.376]   And it will not work because they're getting desperate, Alex.
[01:29:45.376 --> 01:29:47.896]  They're the ones whose backs are up against the wall.
[01:29:47.896 --> 01:29:52.775]   They can see that the train of freedom keeps rolling directly towards them no matter what.
[01:29:52.775 --> 01:29:54.735]  And their financial Ponzi schemes coming to an end.
[01:29:54.735 --> 01:29:56.617]  Elon Musk has got the financial scheme.
[01:29:56.617 --> 01:29:58.537]  The U.S. dollar is already going down.
[01:29:58.537 --> 01:30:02.617]   The World Reserve currency, Saudi Arabia pulling out of the petrodollar.
[01:30:03.329 --> 01:30:16.856]  Imagine, if you think that us being on this show or the continuation of Alex Jones and Jack Posobiec upsets them, imagine what they will do when the petrodollar is on the line.
[01:30:17.297 --> 01:30:20.819]  Imagine the lengths they will go to to protect us.
[01:30:20.839 --> 01:30:24.100]  So yes, imperial overstretch is what we're seeing.
[01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:25.061]  They're overextended.
[01:30:25.081 --> 01:30:26.182]  The empire is overextended.
[01:30:27.142 --> 01:30:35.689]  The Empire still has severe and incredibly dangerous powers with which they can bring to bear to keep that empire secluded.
[01:30:35.749 --> 01:30:39.973]  And by the way, they're going to take their, who do you think they're going to take their frustrations out on, Alex?
[01:30:40.213 --> 01:30:51.983]  They're going to take their frustrations out on, because they can't beat the Russians in the field, they're going to take it out against Middle America, they're going to take it out against Southerners, they're going to take it out against Trump supporters, they're going to take it out against Trump persons.
[01:30:52.023 --> 01:30:52.504]  Catholics!
[01:30:52.764 --> 01:30:53.244]  Which they're going to...
[01:30:54.206 --> 01:30:54.969]  Coerced Catholics?
[01:30:55.230 --> 01:30:56.032]  Traditional Catholics?
[01:30:56.052 --> 01:30:57.357]  Yeah, what's the federation?
[01:30:57.377 --> 01:30:58.701]  What's the fetish with Catholics?
[01:30:59.144 --> 01:31:04.767]  Well, because the Catholics are and always have stood as a massive column in their way.
[01:31:04.887 --> 01:31:10.831]  We talk about this, by the way, in the book a ton, that it's always the Catholics in Russia, of course, the Orthodox and organized religion.
[01:31:10.871 --> 01:31:15.554]  So the most organized religion is always standing in the way of their new religion.
[01:31:15.814 --> 01:31:18.195]  Now, at the time, it was the new religion of Marxism.
[01:31:18.436 --> 01:31:21.317]  Today, we would call it the new religion of cultural Marxism.
[01:31:21.377 --> 01:31:22.278]  This is woke-ism.
[01:31:22.558 --> 01:31:23.619]  This is where it all comes from.
[01:31:23.639 --> 01:31:24.199]  No, no, no.
[01:31:24.539 --> 01:31:25.960]  It's just cultural Marxism.
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:27.301]  They took away the economics.
[01:31:27.341 --> 01:31:28.762]  They replaced it with sociology.
[01:31:28.802 --> 01:31:29.802]  we all get that.
[01:31:29.802 --> 01:31:34.202]   That's right, Americans wouldn't accept communism on economics if they did it socially.
[01:31:34.202 --> 01:31:40.401]   Right, because after the fall of the Soviet Union, you get into a situation where the
[01:31:40.401 --> 01:31:44.082]   people realize that the free market just works too well, it's just too powerful.
[01:31:44.082 --> 01:31:50.202]   Even the Chinese Communist Party under Deng Xiaoping after Chairman Mao dies in '76 realized
[01:31:50.202 --> 01:31:53.641]   that okay, we've got to do something because this is completely falling apart, we're going
[01:31:53.641 --> 01:31:59.481]   to lose power because the Chinese communists then see the fall of the Soviet Union and
[01:31:59.481 --> 01:32:01.322]  they get terrified of this.
[01:32:01.322 --> 01:32:05.481]   They get obsessed with the fall of the Soviet Union and the loss of power and say what do
[01:32:05.481 --> 01:32:06.481]  we need to do?
[01:32:06.481 --> 01:32:08.481]  And they said, you know what, we're going to make a deal.
[01:32:08.471 --> 01:32:20.373]  So, the Chinese Communist Party makes a deal in blood, in the blood of Tiananmen Square, and says, we are going to make a deal with the West, not the people, but the globalist class, and we are going to make... The middlemen Trump talks about.
[01:32:20.433 --> 01:32:21.574]  The middlemen, exactly.
[01:32:21.914 --> 01:32:37.377]  We are going to be the slave labor markets of the world, and they're going to provide the capital, they're going to provide the IP, they're going to provide all the stuff, they're going to sprinkle it all throughout the top, and we'll turn our people into slaves, and they will... Which is what the globalists wanted out of Russia, but the Russians were able to turn it around.
[01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:39.231]  Well they were about to.
[01:32:39.951 --> 01:32:52.983]  So for the first 10 years, the first 10 years under Yeltsin, after the fall of the wall, after the revolution, after Gorbachev comes down, Yeltsin gets in there and Yeltsin is run by the Clintons.
[01:32:53.264 --> 01:33:03.253]  There's even Time Magazine articles on the cover about how the Clintons installed Yeltsin and he was going to be their guy and they just started raping all the resources of Russia.
[01:33:03.493 --> 01:33:07.974]  The same way, by the way, they're doing to the resources of Ukraine and are poised to do even more now.
[01:33:08.154 --> 01:33:09.115]  They don't care about the people.
[01:33:09.155 --> 01:33:10.635]  They don't give a crap about the people.
[01:33:10.875 --> 01:33:12.356]  They want the resources of Ukraine.
[01:33:12.576 --> 01:33:13.536]  They want the mineral rights.
[01:33:13.556 --> 01:33:14.516]  Lindsey Graham is up there.
[01:33:14.996 --> 01:33:21.738]  The only truthful thing that he's ever said about this war is that there are trillions of dollars of minerals under the soil of Ukraine.
[01:33:21.758 --> 01:33:23.179]  He openly said we're going to take the goods.
[01:33:23.319 --> 01:33:24.319]  We want the goods.
[01:33:24.319 --> 01:33:25.319]  He's an associate of ours.
[01:33:25.319 --> 01:33:26.639]  He goes, "Americans don't want to pay for this.
[01:33:26.639 --> 01:33:27.639]  Don't worry."
[01:33:27.639 --> 01:33:30.158]  As if Americans actually get any of that anyways.
[01:33:30.158 --> 01:33:31.158]  Precisely.
[01:33:31.158 --> 01:33:33.199]  And it's not Americans that are getting access to it.
[01:33:33.199 --> 01:33:34.519]  No, it's the globalists.
[01:33:34.519 --> 01:33:35.519]  It's their cabal that gets access.
[01:33:35.519 --> 01:33:37.158]  The same ones shutting off our resources.
[01:33:37.158 --> 01:33:38.158]  This is your BlackRock.
[01:33:38.158 --> 01:33:39.158]  This is your Monsanto.
[01:33:39.158 --> 01:33:42.518]   By the way, Monsanto is, we're jumping all over the place here, but Monsanto, by the
[01:33:42.518 --> 01:33:45.998]  way, because remember, the EU, Alex, bans GMOs.
[01:33:46.237 --> 01:33:54.104]  The EU bans all of this transmogrified processed foods, processed goods, all of it, for coming into their lands, for being made there.
[01:33:55.962 --> 01:34:02.665]  Ukraine is not in the EU, yet Ukraine sits there in Europe, in what part of Europe?
[01:34:02.705 --> 01:34:04.306]  That's right, the breadbasket of Europe.
[01:34:04.386 --> 01:34:10.269]  Those territorial lands, the farmlands directly adjacent to the Black Sea, what do they call it?
[01:34:10.369 --> 01:34:11.249]  The black soil.
[01:34:11.529 --> 01:34:18.152]  This soil is so precious and so enriched for agriculture, you can't even export the black soil in the farmland of Ukraine.
[01:34:18.172 --> 01:34:20.193]  The whole bunch of rivers dump out there, so let me ask you this.
[01:34:20.213 --> 01:34:20.814]  They all want that.
[01:34:21.134 --> 01:34:24.635]  That's what this is about, getting Monsanto and the GMOs in there.
[01:34:24.756 --> 01:34:25.716]  I mean, that's one angle of it.
[01:34:25.796 --> 01:34:26.177]  No, you're right.
[01:34:26.197 --> 01:34:28.700]  They want to get that farmland for their total control.
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:33.106]  So Biden clearly is threatening nuclear war if we don't support him.
[01:34:33.166 --> 01:34:34.268]  How do you see that unfolding?
[01:34:34.308 --> 01:34:35.129]  How do we stop him?
[01:34:35.149 --> 01:34:36.451]  What should Trump be saying?
[01:34:36.471 --> 01:34:36.952]  What should we do?
[01:34:38.694 --> 01:34:46.345]   Honestly, at this point, in order to prevent this, And it's like, what are they going to do?
[01:34:46.445 --> 01:34:48.725]  They're already threatening to throw Trump in jail.
[01:34:49.285 --> 01:34:50.986]  Trump should meet with Zelensky.
[01:34:51.906 --> 01:35:01.208]  Trump should call up Zelensky, because Zelensky just came out and said that he's willing to hold a, to have a settlement, that he doesn't want to prolong the war.
[01:35:01.548 --> 01:35:05.269]  Trump should offer to bring Zelensky all the way to Mar-a-Lago.
[01:35:05.609 --> 01:35:07.050]  Call them out on their BS.
[01:35:07.090 --> 01:35:07.910]  He should Trump them.
[01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:09.430]  Trump them completely.
[01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:12.951]  Bring him down to Mar-a-Lago and say, I will meet with Zelensky.
[01:35:13.631 --> 01:35:17.973]  Because you said six months ago, they're about to get rid of Zelensky and blame him.
[01:35:17.993 --> 01:35:19.474]  So Zelensky now knows that.
[01:35:19.794 --> 01:35:24.217]  So Zelensky and I've been saying this over and over and over.
[01:35:24.577 --> 01:35:26.978]  You have the power to save your country.
[01:35:27.298 --> 01:35:29.139]  You have the power to save your people.
[01:35:29.659 --> 01:35:39.424]  You had the power back in 2019 when you could have told the truth and prevented the first impeachment of Donald Trump, which led to the installation of the regime in 2020.
[01:35:39.744 --> 01:35:42.146]  You could have spoke the truth at that time about Burisma.
[01:35:42.166 --> 01:35:42.526]  You didn't.
[01:35:43.066 --> 01:35:46.588]  How big is this, him and a NATO summit saying, I'm ready to do a deal in two months?
[01:35:46.868 --> 01:35:48.809]  Well, that's not what NATO wants him to say at all.
[01:35:49.209 --> 01:35:50.890]  NATO wants to fight to the last.
[01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:54.692]  So he's breaking with them because he's putting this breakout, saying we can't do this.
[01:35:54.752 --> 01:35:58.213]  Now, NATO is going to come in and say, well, we've got to backfill with NATO troops.
[01:35:58.453 --> 01:35:59.814]  That's how they're going to go to Macron.
[01:35:59.834 --> 01:36:01.175]  So he's got his election coming up.
[01:36:01.215 --> 01:36:04.776]  That's why Macron, by the way, is trying to ban all of his options.
[01:36:04.796 --> 01:36:05.677]  That was my next point.
[01:36:05.837 --> 01:36:06.497]  That was my next point.
[01:36:06.517 --> 01:36:09.879]  So we've got Macron saying, if you don't vote for me, there's civil war.
[01:36:10.539 --> 01:36:17.402]  And then we've got the former CIA director saying, the Republicans are the greatest terror threat to the world, the most dangerous group in the world.
[01:36:17.802 --> 01:36:26.825]  I mean, these are wild statements of the deep state, literally declaring Republicans, they're not even saying Trump now, they're saying the Republican Party needs to be outlawed.
[01:36:27.065 --> 01:36:31.871]  But Alex, here's where our contention, and we write this out in the book as well, we argue that it's not crazy.
[01:36:32.371 --> 01:36:33.793]  We argue that it is a system.
[01:36:34.133 --> 01:36:35.214]  No, no, I get it.
[01:36:35.254 --> 01:36:39.179]  The point is they're now openly declaring war on the populist party.
[01:36:39.279 --> 01:36:40.540]  I mean, they are in trouble.
[01:36:41.842 --> 01:36:47.202]   has already rogered up, because remember, Macron was a direct hire of the globalists.
[01:36:47.202 --> 01:36:52.082]   And you and I talked about this, what, seven years ago, when we had the macro leaks and
[01:36:52.082 --> 01:36:56.322]   the emails from his campaign, that he was a direct hire of the globalists.
[01:36:56.322 --> 01:36:59.401]  They directly installed him to run France.
[01:36:59.401 --> 01:37:02.162]   And why then- >> That's why he's been the biggest foe.
[01:37:02.162 --> 01:37:11.282]   The troops for this potential NATO stabilization force, NATO direct intervention force into
[01:37:11.282 --> 01:37:17.402]   what they're gonna call the green zone of Western Ukraine, is going to be French troops.
[01:37:17.544 --> 01:37:21.446]  They're going to put French in first, that'll be leading the way, and they're going to backfill it with what?
[01:37:21.846 --> 01:37:22.366]  Poland.
[01:37:22.686 --> 01:37:24.347]  Now Poland is going to go up next.
[01:37:24.567 --> 01:37:27.889]  So Poland's going to be in there, and this is going to be the way forward.
[01:37:28.109 --> 01:37:34.051]  So Biden might step back even a little bit and say, OK, we're not going to do Article 5, but we must have NATO involved.
[01:37:34.311 --> 01:37:35.712]  So now you've got NATO involvement.
[01:37:35.912 --> 01:37:37.693]  Now you've got French troops on the ground.
[01:37:37.933 --> 01:37:39.493]  Now you've got Polish troops on the ground.
[01:37:39.733 --> 01:37:45.355]  And they will send the Polish troops in under Donald Tusk, who has been in there, who is another globalist, direct installed.
[01:37:45.395 --> 01:37:47.156]  This guy was the head of the EU.
[01:37:47.256 --> 01:37:49.757]  And he's suddenly erasing the borders, everything.
[01:37:50.277 --> 01:37:52.858]  And so you predicted this a year ago, six months ago on the show.
[01:37:53.258 --> 01:37:55.139]  Predict what's coming next and how we stop it.
[01:37:55.399 --> 01:37:57.981]  So what's going to come next is that they've got to speed up the timetable.
[01:37:58.341 --> 01:38:01.043]  They're realizing that they've got less than four months.
[01:38:01.223 --> 01:38:03.925]  They've got less than four months to execute on all of these things.
[01:38:04.025 --> 01:38:17.594]  And so what President Trump must do, I'm not going to tell President Trump what he must do, but what President Trump could do as a potential way to end around all of this is do what he always does, these direct meetings for peace.
[01:38:17.874 --> 01:38:19.435]  He did it with Kim Jong Un.
[01:38:19.755 --> 01:38:21.817]  He did it with members of the Taliban.
[01:38:21.837 --> 01:38:23.518]  That's the perfect campaign tactic.
[01:38:23.638 --> 01:38:25.119]  Maybe he goes to Ukraine.
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.963]  He doesn't just invite him, he goes.
[01:38:28.163 --> 01:38:30.908]  Alex, if you put Trump in Ukraine, they'll try to kill him.
[01:38:31.048 --> 01:38:32.731]  They'll try to kill him and they'll blame it on the Russians.
[01:38:33.251 --> 01:38:39.081]  So maybe he lands in Poland and invites Zelensky there?
[01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:40.450]  He could do that.
[01:38:40.931 --> 01:38:45.953]  Zelensky comes to the West quite frequently, though, so he could easily... He's got a palace next to Mar-a-Lago.
[01:38:45.973 --> 01:38:47.094]  He could just come there.
[01:38:47.114 --> 01:38:47.894]  Yeah, he'd walk over.
[01:38:48.314 --> 01:38:50.275]  No, I would say do it at Mar-a-Lago.
[01:38:50.336 --> 01:38:51.216]  Do it at Mar-a-Lago.
[01:38:51.616 --> 01:38:58.640]  By the way, I don't even know if President Trump can travel internationally right now, given the fact that he is under this probationary release.
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:08.615]   And by the way, getting back to that, Imagine the pressure now that will be on Judge Juan Marchand to put Trump behind bars.
[01:39:08.655 --> 01:39:21.641]  Steve Bannon, who, as we all know, is going to be reporting on Monday morning at FCI Danbury in Connecticut, his last prediction is that Marchand will give a multi-year sentence to Donald Trump.
[01:39:21.661 --> 01:39:21.901]  Yes.
[01:39:22.161 --> 01:39:26.063]  And now the pressure on Marchand is completely ratcheted up.
[01:39:26.464 --> 01:39:32.607]  That he, that they will be going to him, and they took Marchand- And then they put Trump in Rikers, then they staged false flags and claimed Trump supporters did it.
[01:39:33.302 --> 01:39:34.723]  They'll say Trump supporters did it.
[01:39:34.783 --> 01:39:38.746]  They'll have the agitators out the same way they had the agitators out on January 6th.
[01:39:39.026 --> 01:39:40.747]  They'll say Trump supporters are a menace.
[01:39:40.987 --> 01:39:42.589]  Trump supporters are violent.
[01:39:42.609 --> 01:39:47.152]  And they're already testing, by the way, these types of things in France, where they're saying, we're just going to outlaw the party.
[01:39:47.392 --> 01:39:49.253]  We're going to outlaw the party prior to the election.
[01:39:49.273 --> 01:39:50.154]  Well, that's what Macron says.
[01:39:50.194 --> 01:39:52.776]  He says civil war, so there's a pincer attack.
[01:39:52.836 --> 01:39:55.157]  Civil unrest, civil war staged.
[01:39:56.278 --> 01:39:57.500]  War with Russia, that's the pincer.
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:01.064]  Look, you've got martial law currently in Ukraine.
[01:40:01.344 --> 01:40:09.434]  You've got France saying that because of the potential threat of civil unrest that they've got to ban people and ban parties from the ballot.
[01:40:09.554 --> 01:40:10.615]  Don't take our word for it, folks.
[01:40:11.036 --> 01:40:11.937]  Go look at Macron.
[01:40:12.277 --> 01:40:15.001]  And I don't want to write myself into this, but I'm not that important.
[01:40:15.481 --> 01:40:18.905]  The desperation of the federal trustee three weeks ago trying to lock the doors.
[01:40:19.286 --> 01:40:21.929]  The federal judge who's Trump appointed stopping him three times.
[01:40:21.949 --> 01:40:23.491]  Shutting down of opposition media.
[01:40:23.711 --> 01:40:24.672]  It's not that I'm that important.
[01:40:25.052 --> 01:40:25.913]  I'm just on the list.
[01:40:26.034 --> 01:40:27.355]  It's hysterical orders.
[01:40:27.796 --> 01:40:28.016]  Yes.
[01:40:28.036 --> 01:40:30.279]  Get this off ahead of whatever the event's about to be.
[01:40:30.599 --> 01:40:32.001]  They don't want us on air when this goes down.
[01:40:32.261 --> 01:40:32.581]  Of course.
[01:40:32.982 --> 01:40:36.247]  The shutting down of opposition media, the shutting down of platforms.
[01:40:36.267 --> 01:40:36.787]  That's a coup!
[01:40:36.908 --> 01:40:39.191]  That's the first thing you do in a coup.
[01:40:39.471 --> 01:40:42.155]  This is an un-human uprising.
[01:40:42.516 --> 01:40:43.737]  We've been talking about this.
[01:40:43.798 --> 01:40:44.639]  We've got the system.
[01:40:44.659 --> 01:40:45.901]  Yeah, you barely talked about your books.
[01:40:46.081 --> 01:40:47.222]  Give us a prelude to the next hour.
[01:40:49.085 --> 01:40:51.467]  This is what they've been doing for 250 years.
[01:40:51.487 --> 01:40:53.149]  200 French Revolution years.
[01:40:53.349 --> 01:41:00.556]  From the French Revolution, to Russia, to Spain, to China, it is the same thing every single time.
[01:41:00.956 --> 01:41:04.099]  Don't listen to what they say, look at what they do.
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:09.504]  Give us a prelude to the book on humans, and it comes out a couple days, people can order it right now.
[01:41:10.256 --> 01:41:11.597]  It comes out in just a couple of days.
[01:41:11.637 --> 01:41:13.018]  We've got a few signed copies.
[01:41:13.459 --> 01:41:14.720]  Unhumansbook.com.
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:16.841]  Steve Bannon actually signed a couple of copies.
[01:41:16.881 --> 01:41:20.224]  We were calling that the Political Prisoner Edition.
[01:41:20.284 --> 01:41:21.605]  So he wrote the foreword to the book here.
[01:41:21.625 --> 01:41:24.007]  We've only got, I've only got a few of those left, honestly.
[01:41:24.027 --> 01:41:28.230]  So if you want to get the Steve Bannon signed copy, you need to go to Unhumansbook.com right now.
[01:41:28.491 --> 01:41:29.712]  Because once they're done, they're done.
[01:41:29.852 --> 01:41:32.734]  And as you know, he's not going to be signing any more of these anytime soon.
[01:41:33.275 --> 01:41:34.115]  So that's up.
[01:41:34.135 --> 01:41:35.196]  Of course, Amazon Books A Million.
[01:41:35.236 --> 01:41:35.777]  Everybody, look.
[01:41:36.537 --> 01:41:38.762]  We've cracked the communist code.
[01:41:39.424 --> 01:41:40.867]  The subversion... We have the playbook.
[01:41:40.887 --> 01:41:41.508]  We can stop them.
[01:41:42.813 --> 01:41:54.316]  The disenfranchisement, the ability to unrest and unbalance a civilization in order to turn it against itself, to pit neighbor against neighbor.
[01:41:54.396 --> 01:41:55.036]  The Great Reset.
[01:41:55.376 --> 01:42:04.698]  The Great Reset, the Great Replacement, all of these things that they are doing to build what they call the coalition of the fringes.
[01:42:05.238 --> 01:42:08.439]  To build, to bring in illegal migrants.
[01:42:08.459 --> 01:42:12.320]  That's what the Clintons called it when they first got, they called it the broken coalition strategy.
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:13.021]  Precisely.
[01:42:13.241 --> 01:42:14.562]  The broken coalition strategy.
[01:42:14.622 --> 01:42:20.048]  And so in the broken coalition strategy, what you do is you have to bring in as many broken people as you can.
[01:42:20.269 --> 01:42:22.831]  And by the way, we're not saying broken in a literal sense.
[01:42:22.932 --> 01:42:26.896]  Broken in the sense that you are not part of the core traditional American population.
[01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:47.092]  So, your white, brown, black, the people that have been here for the longest time, those families, they want to dilute that, so they're going to bring in people who are liberals, they're going to bring in people who are third-worlders, they're going to increase that coalition, and then use that to target the rest of the population.
[01:42:47.153 --> 01:42:47.653]  What's they're doing?
[01:42:47.893 --> 01:42:52.738]  Which, and Alex, I'm arguing that this is what they've been doing for 250 years.
[01:42:53.179 --> 01:43:06.694]  And so you take one population and of course you predicate it on atheism, you predicate it on the cult of reason as they did in France, or nowadays you predicate it on your new religion of cultural Marxism.
[01:43:07.074 --> 01:43:20.803]  And so, you use that to target the religious, you target pro-lifers, you throw them up, you lock them up, you target anyone who's a patriot, and this is what they did on January 6th, which by the way, huge, we haven't talked about it, but they're- Yeah, we're talking about next hour.
[01:43:21.424 --> 01:43:23.245]  Major Supreme Court ruling on January 6th.
[01:43:23.325 --> 01:43:27.147]  It was the target, it was an entrapment operation and the targeting of patriots.
[01:43:27.468 --> 01:43:30.490]  They used that as an inverse Bastille.
[01:43:30.810 --> 01:43:32.151]  So we're talking about the French Revolution.
[01:43:32.191 --> 01:43:35.493]  No, it's the ruling elite running a revolution, not the people.
[01:43:35.553 --> 01:43:36.714]  That's what globalism is.
[01:43:37.554 --> 01:43:44.058]  So the revolution on January 6, and we actually refer to this as a micro-revolution because it's an example of a revolution.
[01:43:44.158 --> 01:43:48.721]  You have a series of micro-revolutions within a wider irregular revolution.
[01:43:49.521 --> 01:44:00.128]  And on January 6, they used this as a means to collect all the data and collect all the names, the selectors, the cell phone numbers, the cell phone data.
[01:44:00.368 --> 01:44:03.790]  A microcosm for the larger persecution coming.
[01:44:04.190 --> 01:44:04.770]  Precisely.
[01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:12.854]  And so, they get all the data of the patriots because they know those are the most engaged patriots, the 50 to 100,000 people who were there.
[01:44:13.134 --> 01:44:14.354]  We've got all the data now.
[01:44:14.594 --> 01:44:15.395]  So now we've got the list.
[01:44:15.415 --> 01:44:16.235]  January 6th was a war game.
[01:44:16.675 --> 01:44:17.356]  It was a war game.
[01:44:17.616 --> 01:44:20.297]  So now we've got the entire list of patriots.
[01:44:20.537 --> 01:44:22.578]  You go after the people who were the leaders first.
[01:44:23.058 --> 01:44:26.419]  Then you go after the people who were the most engaged.
[01:44:26.699 --> 01:44:29.980]  Then you use that event to go after people like Steve Bannon.
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:31.180]  You put up your show trial.
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:32.681]  Bannon says he doesn't want to get involved.
[01:44:32.701 --> 01:44:33.841]  So great, throw him in jail.
[01:44:34.081 --> 01:44:35.762]  Navarro, he's already behind bars.
[01:44:36.002 --> 01:44:39.443]  And then you go after any media figures who were associated with it.
[01:44:39.463 --> 01:44:40.763]  So you go after Alex Jones.
[01:44:40.963 --> 01:44:44.144]  You go, and Alex, we've got the video of you right on top of the trunk.
[01:44:44.164 --> 01:44:46.265]  Say, do not go in there.
[01:44:46.385 --> 01:44:48.526]  Don't give them up because you called it in real time.
[01:44:48.786 --> 01:44:57.189]   You could see the operation unfolding around you and you were trying to Well yeah, we had a rented area for Trump to come speak and the Secret Service wouldn't take him there.
[01:44:57.509 --> 01:44:58.889]  It was obvious we walked into a trap.
[01:44:58.949 --> 01:44:59.850]  I was like, oh my God.
[01:45:00.930 --> 01:45:19.137]  And you're one of the only people who realized it in real time as it was going on, but suddenly these federal operations, and this is why they didn't bring the National Guard in, and I want people to understand, they must understand, and there's a whole chapter on this in the book, that January 6th was an operation run against the American people.
[01:45:19.397 --> 01:45:23.220]  President Trump got pretty close, by the way, last night in that debate to bringing that up.
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:24.822]  He got pretty close to bringing that up.
[01:45:24.842 --> 01:45:32.188]  They kept cutting him off, but the good news is, people rejected January 6th, the fake committee had to destroy all the evidence because it was the proof of their crime.
[01:45:32.208 --> 01:45:32.728]  He did say that.
[01:45:33.149 --> 01:45:39.074]  He did say, he said, if this was such an upright committee, why did they delete all of their evidence?
[01:45:39.114 --> 01:45:39.974]  And it's very clear.
[01:45:40.234 --> 01:45:46.420]  It's very clear that they deleted their evidence because this was about, and again, I always say it again and again and again.
[01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:47.801]  Look at what they do.
[01:45:48.081 --> 01:45:49.201]  Don't listen to what they say.
[01:45:49.442 --> 01:45:50.082]  What are they doing?
[01:45:50.302 --> 01:45:51.643]  They're locking up patriots.
[01:45:51.843 --> 01:45:53.384]  They're shutting down patriots.
[01:45:53.644 --> 01:45:56.025]  They're destroying any semblance of freedom.
[01:45:56.045 --> 01:45:58.407]  And they do so in the name of democracy.
[01:45:58.647 --> 01:46:00.288]  They do so in the name of integrity.
[01:46:00.328 --> 01:46:02.829]  They say, we are the ones who are going to keep you safe.
[01:46:02.849 --> 01:46:06.732]  Let me ask you this, because, you know, we want to be positive about last night's debate.
[01:46:06.752 --> 01:46:08.773]  We shed some of the positive things to get into your book.
[01:46:10.498 --> 01:46:12.999]  But the negative is that they were planning to get rid of Biden.
[01:46:13.019 --> 01:46:13.759]  This was a coup.
[01:46:14.319 --> 01:46:17.000]  But at the same time, I look at the faces of their minions.
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:17.921]  I look at the globalists.
[01:46:17.941 --> 01:46:18.821]  They look scared.
[01:46:19.201 --> 01:46:21.262]  Their own white papers that leak say they're losing.
[01:46:21.802 --> 01:46:28.404]  I mean, I want people to have the faith, though, to know I believe we have the initiative because we understand our operation and we're actually winning.
[01:46:28.684 --> 01:46:32.626]  We have to admit how bad it is and make preparation for what the real threats are.
[01:46:32.666 --> 01:46:39.088]  But as long as we know we're winning, trust in God and admit how serious it is, I think it's fair to say we have the initiative.
[01:46:39.608 --> 01:46:41.250]  Alex, the entire final chapter.
[01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:42.832]  You're going to love the last chapter of this book, man.
[01:46:43.132 --> 01:46:44.554]  Because the final chapter... I'm going to read it tonight.
[01:46:44.574 --> 01:46:45.154]  I've been wanting a copy.
[01:46:45.195 --> 01:46:45.955]  The final chapter.
[01:46:45.975 --> 01:46:47.457]  I've got five copies right here for you.
[01:46:47.958 --> 01:46:49.139]  The final chapter on this?
[01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:51.081]  The counter-revolution.
[01:46:51.482 --> 01:46:54.085]  The counter-system to the Un-Humans playbook.
[01:46:54.465 --> 01:47:05.615]  How do you, once you understand their system, and we give you all the details of how they've used it in the past, we use 5G warfare, through my background in Navy Intelligence, through my background and what I've learned.
[01:47:05.635 --> 01:47:06.776]  And look, warfare has changed.
[01:47:07.036 --> 01:47:08.678]  So it's information warfare.
[01:47:08.958 --> 01:47:15.544]  It's building those networks, networks of men, networks of moms, becoming the sheriff of your territory.
[01:47:15.844 --> 01:47:25.330]   And then, Alex, and this is, if I can, and I just have to do this, I have to send a, An update, a software upgrade to the movement that's out there.
[01:47:25.690 --> 01:47:37.054]  I'm sick and tired of people thinking that if we just call out their hypocrisy, if we just point out that it's a double standard that we're going to win, we're saying you're not being fair.
[01:47:37.654 --> 01:47:41.335]  No, you have to actually take the fight to these people.
[01:47:41.375 --> 01:47:42.195]  And what do I mean by that?
[01:47:42.255 --> 01:47:43.436]  I mean reciprocity.
[01:47:43.716 --> 01:47:48.677]  I mean, if they're locking up Donald Trump and Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, then guess what?
[01:47:48.997 --> 01:47:50.958]  We need to start locking them.
[01:47:51.438 --> 01:47:53.757]  reciprocity once we finally realize.
[01:47:53.757 --> 01:47:55.877]  And it's exact reciprocity.
[01:47:55.877 --> 01:47:58.038]  I'm not talking about- We didn't draw first blood.
[01:47:58.038 --> 01:47:59.038]  We did not.
[01:47:59.038 --> 01:48:00.917]   But through the system legally lawfully, we gotta lock them up.
[01:48:00.917 --> 01:48:03.957]  This is because our society is unbalanced, Alex.
[01:48:03.957 --> 01:48:04.957]  It's totally unbalanced.
[01:48:04.957 --> 01:48:05.957]  It's a bunch of bullies.
[01:48:05.957 --> 01:48:08.518]  Too much power on one end.
[01:48:08.518 --> 01:48:13.797]   And the only way to fix that, to get back to what, and the Russians understand reciprocity,
[01:48:13.797 --> 01:48:14.797]  by the way.
[01:48:14.797 --> 01:48:21.837]   This is why when Biden gave the order for long range missiles to be used from Ukraine
[01:48:21.837 --> 01:48:26.597]   into Russia proper, into the motherland, then what does Russia respond with?
[01:48:26.867 --> 01:48:36.453]  Well, now all of a sudden you've got nuclear submarines off the coast of Miami, because they understand reciprocity is the only language that the un-humans speak.
[01:48:36.793 --> 01:48:42.496]  They'll say, fine, you don't want peace, you don't want to sit down and talk, we'll remind you what we can do.
[01:48:42.937 --> 01:48:46.179]  We'll remind you of the potential threat that...
[01:48:50.282 --> 01:48:57.749]  And the Russians put them in Cuba.
[01:48:57.989 --> 01:49:02.733]  So again, this is and this throughout the Civil War, this is what we refer to as atomic diplomacy.
[01:49:03.194 --> 01:49:08.078]  And so when we talk about reciprocity, it actually creates a balance.
[01:49:08.178 --> 01:49:13.303]  And it is the only way to build a situation where we don't have to be doing these things anymore.
[01:49:13.643 --> 01:49:14.883]  It will not stop, Alex.
[01:49:15.163 --> 01:49:16.624]  It will not stop on its own.
[01:49:16.864 --> 01:49:25.146]  And that is why the people of this audience, once they get this book, they will understand that you must hold our people, our side, to account.
[01:49:25.186 --> 01:49:26.587]  And by the way- Everyone should get the book.
[01:49:26.607 --> 01:49:27.007]  Stay there.
[01:49:27.407 --> 01:49:30.208]  We're going to run a promo for the next five minutes.
[01:49:30.328 --> 01:49:31.968]  Did you hear what Speaker Johnson just said this morning?
[01:49:32.108 --> 01:49:32.708]  No, come back.
[01:49:32.748 --> 01:49:33.809]  We got two hours left, brother.
[01:49:34.509 --> 01:49:38.150]  HSBC and JPMorgan Chase.
[01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:41.671]  So, you look at what do they do?
[01:49:41.731 --> 01:49:44.152]  What are they the biggest banks in the world of?
[01:49:44.872 --> 01:49:51.374]  Those two are number one and number two largest short sellers of silver on the planet.
[01:49:51.794 --> 01:49:52.514]  Those two banks.
[01:49:53.094 --> 01:49:57.756]  And now we're starting to see a short squeeze happening in silver.
[01:49:58.176 --> 01:50:05.158]  But we had 568 million ounces of silver being shorted, naked shorts.
[01:50:05.618 --> 01:50:06.959]  Meaning they don't own the assets.
[01:50:07.339 --> 01:50:12.382]  They just put these futures contracts on them to shorts to drive the price down.
[01:50:12.802 --> 01:50:26.849]  Well, when you have a short position and the value of the underlying thing that you're shorting goes up, Alex, you lose money hand over fist in multiples, not dollar for dollar, but multiples.
[01:50:27.289 --> 01:50:40.678]   The day before Iran basically sent those drones into Israel, China made this announcement, said, hey, everybody in China, start buying silver.
[01:50:41.238 --> 01:50:42.539]  Don't just buy gold.
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:43.840]  Buy silver.
[01:50:44.101 --> 01:50:48.944]  You made the point that China was trying to call the naked shorts of the Western central banks.
[01:50:49.485 --> 01:50:52.307]  Look at what's happened to silver since that time.
[01:50:53.087 --> 01:50:54.007]  Skyrocketing!
[01:50:54.488 --> 01:51:15.955]  You've got low supply, you've got high demand, you've got a short squeeze starting where the manufacturers of the world, the defense contractors, the aerospace industry, the fuel cell technology people, the solar people, they all need silver and there's not much available because India has already committed to 66% of the world's supply this year.
[01:51:15.995 --> 01:51:18.696]  So here's where we've got this short squeeze happening.
[01:51:18.856 --> 01:51:21.677]  Physical supply coming out of inventory.
[01:51:22.157 --> 01:51:25.358]  Not available for the manufacturers to purchase.
[01:51:25.958 --> 01:51:31.140]  And what has happened to the price of silver in the last two and a half months?
[01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:38.161]  Literally, the last 75 days or so, silver's gone from 22 and a half to almost 32.
[01:51:38.422 --> 01:51:42.883]  It's up like 45% in two and a half months.
[01:51:43.623 --> 01:51:50.145]  And you've got those Western banks that have millions, hundreds of trillions of ounces of silver short.
[01:51:50.985 --> 01:51:52.245]  And the price went up 45%.
[01:51:53.046 --> 01:51:55.386]  They are losing money hand over fist.
[01:51:55.787 --> 01:52:10.351]  So part of me says this kind of being on the wrong side of a price move when it's leveraged could cause HSBC and JP Morgan Chase to have a really, really, really big financial problem.
[01:52:10.671 --> 01:52:13.372]  And their CEOs are jumping ship.
[01:52:13.992 --> 01:52:15.172]  They're getting out of Dodge.
[01:52:15.732 --> 01:52:16.993]  Our firm is just different.
[01:52:17.393 --> 01:52:21.354]  We charge 8% when you purchase, 0% when you liquidate.
[01:52:21.714 --> 01:52:27.695]  We buy directly from the depository in Shiner, Texas, the Texas Precious Metals Depository.
[01:52:28.115 --> 01:52:32.596]  So their wholesale prices, you tack on 8%, they ship it directly to you.
[01:52:33.036 --> 01:52:35.997]  When you sell it back, we take nothing.
[01:52:36.697 --> 01:52:37.158]  Zero.
[01:52:37.658 --> 01:52:40.260]  And whatever the depository prices are, you get all of it.
[01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:54.168]  See, that's a huge difference from buying a rare coin, something that has a high commission, high premium, where even after the big move in silver that we've seen, you still haven't even broken even.
[01:52:54.529 --> 01:52:56.470]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:57.230]  Check them out.
[01:52:57.290 --> 01:52:57.871]  Go on the site.
[01:52:58.331 --> 01:52:58.712]  Call him.
[01:52:58.752 --> 01:52:59.613]  Get a consultation.
[01:52:59.713 --> 01:53:00.134]  Email him.
[01:53:00.194 --> 01:53:00.714]  Talk to him.
[01:53:00.734 --> 01:53:01.055]  720-605-3900.
[01:53:01.115 --> 01:53:01.595]  Again, that's 720-605-3900.
[01:53:01.676 --> 01:53:03.538]  One of the most important calls you would make, obviously.
[01:53:03.938 --> 01:53:05.420]  And like he's been saying, get silver.
[01:53:05.239 --> 01:53:11.719]   One of the most important calls you would make, obviously, and like he's been saying,
[01:53:11.719 --> 01:53:13.719]  get silver, up 40% on the year.
[01:53:13.719 --> 01:53:16.880]   He says that he'll make such profits in silver when the gold run starts.
[01:53:16.892 --> 01:53:24.495]  He used that profit to buy the gold, and you sell it back to Dr. Kirk Elliott with zero cost, which no big broker, no big company does.
[01:53:24.535 --> 01:53:27.536]  That's why there are 4.7 star ratings that nobody else has.

[01:54:27.637 --> 01:54:30.357]  InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:54:30.357 --> 01:54:43.316]   Making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able
[01:54:43.316 --> 01:54:54.676]   to do with the COVID, excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with, look, if
[01:54:54.676 --> 01:54:57.474]   *cries* We finally beat Medicare.
[01:54:57.815 --> 01:55:01.116]  We're trying to find housing for black Americans.
[01:55:01.196 --> 01:55:11.919]  The impact on the choice, the idea that they're gonna, I'm not, I've been proposing that everybody, they pay.
[01:55:12.839 --> 01:55:15.342]  The millionaires pay 1%, 1%.
[01:55:16.223 --> 01:55:20.587]  So no one after, I've not raised the cost of Social Security for anybody.
[01:55:21.028 --> 01:55:25.252]  I got my handicap when I was Vice President down to a six.
[01:55:26.153 --> 01:55:39.223]   And once you get away with it, you get rid of the ability of Medicare for the ability For us to be able to negotiate drug prices with the big pharma companies.
[01:55:39.643 --> 01:55:41.303]  What I'm going to do is fix the tax system.
[01:55:41.323 --> 01:55:45.104]  For example, we had a thousand trillionaires in America.
[01:55:45.144 --> 01:55:46.684]  I mean billionaires in America.
[01:55:46.744 --> 01:55:48.065]  No one was hurt.
[01:55:48.105 --> 01:55:50.265]  No one Israeli was accidentally killed.
[01:55:50.845 --> 01:55:52.226]  And it just stopped.
[01:55:52.346 --> 01:55:59.265]   I'm going to continue to move until we get the total ban, the total initiative relative
[01:55:59.265 --> 01:56:04.185]   to what we're going to do with more border patrol and more asylum officers.
[01:56:04.185 --> 01:56:13.705]   I went to the World War II cemetery, World War I cemetery, refused to go to.
[01:56:13.682 --> 01:56:19.206]  He was standing with his four-star general and he told me, he said, I don't want to go in there because they're a bunch of losers and suckers.
[01:56:19.706 --> 01:56:21.688]  My son was not a loser, was not a sucker.
[01:56:21.968 --> 01:56:22.669]  You're the sucker.
[01:56:22.829 --> 01:56:23.509]  You're the loser.
[01:56:24.150 --> 01:56:24.630]  President Trump?
[01:56:25.852 --> 01:56:27.213]  First of all, that was a made-up quote.
[01:56:27.253 --> 01:56:28.193]  Suckers and losers.
[01:56:28.233 --> 01:56:28.874]  They made it up.
[01:56:28.954 --> 01:56:32.536]  It was in a third-rate magazine that's failing, like many of these magazines.
[01:56:33.136 --> 01:56:33.796]  He made that up.
[01:56:34.197 --> 01:56:35.337]  He put it in commercials.
[01:56:35.437 --> 01:56:36.358]  We've notified him.
[01:56:36.718 --> 01:56:38.859]  We had 19 people that said I didn't say it.
[01:56:38.919 --> 01:56:39.479]  And think of this.
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:43.562]  Who would say I'm at a cemetery or I'm talking about our veterans?
[01:56:43.782 --> 01:56:45.423]  Because nobody's taken better care.
[01:56:45.443 --> 01:56:47.784]  I'm so glad this came up and he brought it up.
[01:56:48.764 --> 01:56:51.726]  There's nobody that's taken better care of our soldiers than I have.
[01:56:52.361 --> 01:56:56.786]  To think that I would, in front of generals and others, say, suckers and losers.
[01:56:56.806 --> 01:57:00.709]  We have 19 people that said, it was never said by me.
[01:57:01.210 --> 01:57:02.291]  It was made up by him.
[01:57:02.371 --> 01:57:04.413]  Just like Russia, Russia, Russia was made up.
[01:57:04.754 --> 01:57:08.017]  Just like the 51 intelligence agents are made up.
[01:57:08.627 --> 01:57:12.511]  Just like the new thing with the 16 economists are talking, it's the same thing.
[01:57:13.272 --> 01:57:17.856]  51 intelligence agents said that the laptop was Russia disinformation.
[01:57:17.996 --> 01:57:18.477]  It wasn't.
[01:57:18.737 --> 01:57:20.419]  That came from his son, Hunter.
[01:57:20.979 --> 01:57:22.621]  It wasn't Russia disinformation.
[01:57:22.881 --> 01:57:26.945]  He made up the suckers and losers, so he should apologize to me right now.
[01:57:27.774 --> 01:57:31.618]  Four-star general standing at your side who was on your staff who said you said it.
[01:57:32.058 --> 01:57:32.438]  Period.
[01:57:32.799 --> 01:57:33.539]  That's number one.
[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:39.605]  And number two, the idea, the idea that I have to apologize to you for anything along the line.
[01:57:40.025 --> 01:57:42.868]  We've done more for veterans than any president has in American history.
[01:57:43.388 --> 01:57:45.950]  American history and they now are in their family.
[01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:53.076]  The only sacred obligation we have as a country is to care for our veterans when they come home and their families and equip them when they go to war.
[01:57:53.556 --> 01:57:54.497]  That's what we're doing.
[01:57:54.797 --> 01:57:56.218]  That's what the VA is doing now.
[01:57:56.378 --> 01:58:19.978]   They're doing more for veterans than ever before in our history.
[01:58:19.975 --> 01:58:21.457]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:58:26.206 --> 01:58:30.070]  When I grow up, I want to be a threat to the New World Order.
[01:58:30.590 --> 01:58:31.171]  And guess what?
[01:58:31.231 --> 01:58:33.853]  I grew up, and I got a chance to do it.
[01:58:33.953 --> 01:58:36.395]  We now take you live to Jack Posobiec.
[01:58:36.696 --> 01:58:39.738]  Alright, we just spent an hour, Jack, which I think was very important to do.
[01:58:39.798 --> 01:58:43.842]  I did the same thing before we got in here, saying, hey, we had a big victory, but they're going to strike back.
[01:58:43.882 --> 01:58:44.322]  But now...
[01:58:45.615 --> 01:58:46.356]  The numbers are coming.
[01:58:46.376 --> 01:58:48.997]  You were just saying during the break, full panic mode.
[01:58:49.398 --> 01:58:55.101]  Warren Buffett has come out and said he has nothing to do with Bill Gates and his foundation, meaning Bill Gates is about to get in a lot of trouble.
[01:58:55.862 --> 01:59:00.985]  That's a big article out of CNBC News that we'll be getting to.
[01:59:01.786 --> 01:59:05.008]  We've got the Border Patrol Union saying we all do not support you.
[01:59:05.048 --> 01:59:06.209]  Biden is a liar.
[01:59:06.769 --> 01:59:10.812]  We've got a new Trump video you just sent them about locking these criminals up.
[01:59:11.352 --> 01:59:15.195]  No, Biden saying that he'll have Trump locked up.
[01:59:16.535 --> 01:59:17.856]  This is, this is Biden.
[01:59:17.876 --> 01:59:18.976]  We'll get the video in a second.
[01:59:19.036 --> 01:59:21.237]  Well, as soon as I have the video, we just talked 30 seconds ago.
[01:59:21.257 --> 01:59:23.498]  As soon as we have the video, let me know how many of you have it, guys.
[01:59:24.119 --> 01:59:25.459]  All right?
[01:59:25.539 --> 01:59:29.421]  So, this moment is major because they tried to prop up Biden.
[01:59:29.481 --> 01:59:30.962]  They thought they could continue him.
[01:59:31.322 --> 01:59:32.762]  Now they admit that's not the case.
[01:59:34.323 --> 01:59:36.404]  How would you quantify this moment we're in right now?
[01:59:37.457 --> 01:59:43.216]   We're in an incredibly dangerous moment. We're in a chaos point right now, because the power
[01:59:43.216 --> 01:59:48.097]   vacuum at the center, look, the United States government, the regime that controls the United
[01:59:48.097 --> 01:59:54.577]   States government is supposed to be sacrosanct. It's supposed to be stable. It is supposed to be
[01:59:54.577 --> 02:00:00.896]   in total control. There's never supposed to be a threat or a gaping maw at the center of that.
[02:00:00.896 --> 02:00:07.377]   And yet with Joe Biden's debate performance last night, suddenly he lost the political capital
[02:00:07.377 --> 02:00:12.097]   of the presidency. And that's something that had been propped up, as we explained over and over
[02:00:12.097 --> 02:00:18.176]   again, by what do they call it, cheap fake media that had been propped up by intelligence apparatchiks
[02:00:18.176 --> 02:00:23.297]   that had been propped up by oligarchs. Now we know that all of the money they spent propping
[02:00:23.297 --> 02:00:27.057]   up Biden has been completely lost. So now there's a power vacuum.
[02:00:27.233 --> 02:00:28.774]  Well, they flipped the switch.
[02:00:29.174 --> 02:00:33.416]  They flipped the switch to say he won't leave because they've been trying to get him to step down.
[02:00:33.657 --> 02:00:35.398]  Remember, they didn't want him to run.
[02:00:35.878 --> 02:00:37.679]  They wanted him to step down.
[02:00:37.939 --> 02:00:43.622]  They wanted Kamala to be the candidate or at least have one or maybe Newsom come up and Buttigieg or some other thing.
[02:00:43.882 --> 02:00:44.863]  But he refused.
[02:00:44.903 --> 02:00:46.324]  And really it was Joe Biden who refused.
[02:00:46.344 --> 02:00:52.947]  We reported this Human Events Daily day in, day out for two years straight, even on the very first episode of my own program.
[02:00:52.967 --> 02:00:53.808]  This is what we talked about.
[02:00:54.088 --> 02:01:07.825]  And we used to call it the shade war, that they didn't want him to run again, that they wanted it to be one term, they wanted him to make some announcement seven months ago about how, well, you know, I've been thinking about it, and taking some time for the family, and I had a good run, I made it to the presidency, but I'm gonna get out.
[02:01:07.845 --> 02:01:10.348]  So classically, their own internal... They refused.
[02:01:11.008 --> 02:01:13.051]  Their own political power struggles are undoing them.
[02:01:13.371 --> 02:01:16.914]  Their own political power struggles are undoing, so they couldn't get him to agree to it.
[02:01:16.954 --> 02:01:17.795]  This is the big problem.
[02:01:18.136 --> 02:01:27.224]  Because the way the Democrat structure is set up at the DNC, that unless he agrees to step down, they can't replace him.
[02:01:27.484 --> 02:01:32.289]  There's no function for them to be able to do so, even if they throw... because he already won the primary.
[02:01:32.569 --> 02:01:34.931]  And so if he's already won the primary, he's already got the delegates.
[02:01:35.231 --> 02:01:36.612]  All the superdelegates are pledged.
[02:01:36.792 --> 02:01:40.574]  So they're trying to find some other means to get rid of him.
[02:01:40.934 --> 02:01:43.016]  That's why they've turned on the firehose of the media.
[02:01:43.256 --> 02:01:45.017]  That's why they flipped the kill switch on Biden.
[02:01:45.277 --> 02:01:46.418]  They're going to try to do anything.
[02:01:46.558 --> 02:01:50.200]  Biden on the reverse side now is threatening World War III.
[02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:51.761]  He's threatening to have President Trump locked up.
[02:01:51.781 --> 02:01:53.142]  Did they say they have a clip?
[02:01:53.522 --> 02:01:54.283]  Yeah, they have the clip.
[02:01:54.303 --> 02:01:55.244]  Here is the clip.
[02:01:55.304 --> 02:01:56.165]  I got it backwards.
[02:01:56.185 --> 02:01:57.507]  We were talking during a one-minute break.
[02:01:57.707 --> 02:01:59.269]  Because people need to understand.
[02:01:59.289 --> 02:02:00.029]  Describe this clip.
[02:02:00.150 --> 02:02:00.971]  This is a big deal.
[02:02:01.031 --> 02:02:02.012]  This just happened.
[02:02:02.032 --> 02:02:07.618]  Yeah, I was getting coffee during the break and I saw him on TV saying something and I missed it.
[02:02:07.698 --> 02:02:08.359]  He was just saying it.
[02:02:08.479 --> 02:02:13.142]  And right, because, well, it's usually that chant, lock him up, lock him up, you usually think that's a Trump crowd.
[02:02:13.302 --> 02:02:16.384]  And we know that Trump's got a rally this afternoon here about Hillary.
[02:02:16.765 --> 02:02:17.645]  This is the opposite.
[02:02:17.925 --> 02:02:22.488]  This is a Biden crowd that's chanting, lock him up, lock him up.
[02:02:22.809 --> 02:02:25.330]  And then Biden responds, confirming it.
[02:02:25.329 --> 02:02:26.329]  Here it is.
[02:02:26.329 --> 02:02:27.329]  He's got more trials coming up.
[02:02:27.329 --> 02:02:28.329]  Lock him up, lock him up, lock him up, lock him up.
[02:02:28.329 --> 02:02:29.329]  It's time for that.
[02:02:29.329 --> 02:02:39.890]  Lock him up, lock him up, lock him up, lock him up.
[02:02:39.890 --> 02:02:44.809]   That is invaluable to Trump, them showing it's purely political, which we all know.
[02:02:44.809 --> 02:02:46.769]  There's an appointed time, Alex.
[02:02:46.769 --> 02:02:48.289]  There's an appointed time.
[02:02:48.289 --> 02:02:50.069]  The time has been appointed.
[02:02:50.069 --> 02:02:53.168]  We know that he's gonna be locked up.
[02:02:53.168 --> 02:02:57.208]   What did we just talk about last hour prior to Biden coming out and saying...
[02:02:57.227 --> 02:02:58.168]  When is Trump sentencing?
[02:02:58.348 --> 02:02:59.769]  July 11th.
[02:03:00.029 --> 02:03:03.191]  That's what he means, is that July 11th is coming in.
[02:03:03.551 --> 02:03:11.136]  Juan Marchand, who was the hand-selected judge for this, don't even tell me that, oh, it's just a random algorithm choice of the clerks.
[02:03:11.156 --> 02:03:11.637]  No, come on.
[02:03:11.757 --> 02:03:21.303]  Why doesn't Trump just go to, like, Texas and have the governor say, we're not putting up with this, it's a constitutional crisis, and force the Supreme Court to override this?
[02:03:21.423 --> 02:03:23.405]  Or, I think Trump's going to be Christ-like.
[02:03:23.465 --> 02:03:24.465]  He's going to go to Rikers.
[02:03:25.646 --> 02:03:32.289]  Because, and you saw him last night, Trump knows how many patriots would die in a Civil War scenario.
[02:03:32.329 --> 02:03:35.370]  He knows that the Civil War was the bloodiest war in our history.
[02:03:35.390 --> 02:03:37.351]  And that's why he was so strong.
[02:03:37.411 --> 02:03:39.392]  He was almost, he was sad when he walked out there.
[02:03:39.672 --> 02:03:41.193]  Look, he knew what he had to do.
[02:03:41.533 --> 02:03:45.695]  And you can tell, by the way, that, look, Trump's the guy, he wants a fair fight.
[02:03:45.795 --> 02:03:49.817]  He wants to go in there and throw some haymakers, and he wants someone who's on his level.
[02:03:49.857 --> 02:03:52.798]  And he said, this guy, he's already defeated himself.
[02:03:52.878 --> 02:03:53.999]  This guy is not a threat.
[02:03:54.679 --> 02:03:57.447]  So Trump will, he will report to President.
[02:03:58.353 --> 02:03:59.754]  But you're saying it on the 11th.
[02:03:59.774 --> 02:04:01.775]  Will he report is an interesting question.
[02:04:01.875 --> 02:04:02.716]  Will he report?
[02:04:02.996 --> 02:04:11.882]  Look, I think what you're hearing now is President Joe Biden is giving direct orders and certainly putting direct influence.
[02:04:12.183 --> 02:04:15.485]  I thought I thought for sure they'd be doing this behind the scenes, by the way.
[02:04:15.905 --> 02:04:19.248]  I thought this would be, you know, the phone calls and the smoke filled back rooms.
[02:04:19.488 --> 02:04:24.291]  But no, Joe Biden is doing it in public at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina.
[02:04:24.551 --> 02:04:26.753]  He's telling them affirmatively.
[02:04:26.773 --> 02:04:27.013]  That's right.
[02:04:26.893 --> 02:04:30.493]   What he's gonna do with Mershawn, he said there's a time for that.
[02:04:30.493 --> 02:04:36.292]   And they already tried to take Trump off the ballot, so this will send him even 10 points higher.
[02:04:36.292 --> 02:04:38.693]  And Alex too, what is July 11th?
[02:04:38.693 --> 02:04:44.292]   July 11th is the Thursday before the Monday of the start of the invocation of the Republican National Convention.
[02:04:44.292 --> 02:04:50.893]   So don't think for a second that Nikki Haley and the Uniparty isn't looking at that and saying, "Hmm."
[02:04:51.052 --> 02:04:59.680]  If he's been sentenced, is there any way that we can use this to our ends to put maybe someone else?
[02:04:59.780 --> 02:05:04.084]  And then they staged terror attacks and say conservatives did it, and they caused civil war and martial law.
[02:05:04.404 --> 02:05:06.366]  We'll play the clip back to back twice again.
[02:05:06.386 --> 02:05:07.107]  This is so big.
[02:05:07.147 --> 02:05:07.507]  Here it is.
[02:05:09.208 --> 02:05:10.610]  He's got more trials coming up.
[02:05:10.630 --> 02:05:12.491]  Lock him up!
[02:05:15.574 --> 02:05:15.874]  Lock him up!
[02:05:15.934 --> 02:05:16.515]  Lock him up!
[02:05:17.878 --> 02:05:20.379]  Look at that smile.
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:25.981]  He's got more trials coming up.
[02:05:26.642 --> 02:05:28.502]  He actually does have more trials coming up.
[02:05:28.542 --> 02:05:34.265]  Look at all these hopeless women cheering their pedophile God.
[02:05:36.626 --> 02:05:38.346]  You couldn't make something up this epic.
[02:05:38.366 --> 02:05:40.887]  That's why they say, Jack, truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:05:40.927 --> 02:05:42.048]  This is so insane.
[02:05:42.975 --> 02:05:45.997]  If we wrote this in a Hollywood script, it would get rejected.
[02:05:46.097 --> 02:05:47.137]  They say this is ridiculous.
[02:05:47.197 --> 02:05:47.837]  It never happened.
[02:05:47.857 --> 02:05:58.363]  You'd never have someone go from a debate like that to then coming out and calling for the arrest and the imprisonment of the man who bit.
[02:05:58.383 --> 02:06:06.266]  That's how bad he got beat last night, is that he's calling for his opponent to literally be imprisoned, and he's willing to do so.
[02:06:06.326 --> 02:06:12.129]   So this, by the way, Alex, they know that this No, I totally agree, but look how freaked out he looks at the rally.
[02:06:12.189 --> 02:06:12.749]  He's terrified.
[02:06:12.569 --> 02:06:16.569]  scenario. They want civil war. They want the civil unrest.
[02:06:16.569 --> 02:06:23.139]   They want to do anything to shut down this election. They know that in a fair fight,
[02:06:23.139 --> 02:06:29.029]   one on one, mano y mano, stand up, stand down, that Joe Biden goes down. >> No, I totally
[02:06:29.029 --> 02:06:32.969]   agree, but look how freaked out he looks at the rally.
[02:06:32.969 --> 02:06:38.448]   He's terrified. He's absolutely terrified cuz he knows what happened the night before.
[02:06:38.448 --> 02:06:39.889]  He knows that he doesn't have it left.
[02:06:39.923 --> 02:06:41.225]  And his own party wants him gone.
[02:06:41.945 --> 02:06:43.026]  And he knows what the stakes are.
[02:06:43.367 --> 02:06:46.109]  He knows that the kill switch has been engaged.
[02:06:46.450 --> 02:06:47.691]  And so he's responding.
[02:06:47.871 --> 02:06:49.873]  And Alex, this is exactly what I said.
[02:06:50.353 --> 02:06:52.856]  He's responding with anger.
[02:06:53.236 --> 02:06:55.838]  And he's responding with escalating.
[02:06:56.199 --> 02:06:57.680]  Now, so there's escalation.
[02:06:57.700 --> 02:07:00.123]  For three months when I was like 16, I was an exterminator.
[02:07:00.723 --> 02:07:05.787]  And we would go spray a house with poison, all of a sudden the roaches would start flopping around acting all weird.
[02:07:06.128 --> 02:07:07.649]  He looks like a poisoned cockroach.
[02:07:08.230 --> 02:07:12.233]  Like he knows he's politically gone, so he's just kind of wandering around right now.
[02:07:12.253 --> 02:07:19.039]  Right, but now imagine though, if the cockroach had sentience, and the cockroach had the ability to fight back.
[02:07:19.079 --> 02:07:19.920]  And launch nuclear war.
[02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:22.802]  And launch nuclear war, and knew that you were coming for them.
[02:07:22.822 --> 02:07:24.504]  So an angry cockroach would blow the planet up.
[02:07:25.256 --> 02:07:31.061]  Blow the planet up, would launch the country into civil domestic disturbances, would launch civil unrest.
[02:07:31.081 --> 02:07:36.305]  That's the thing, the globalists, the CIA former director says the number one threat is conservative Christians.
[02:07:36.345 --> 02:07:37.826]  They're the enemy, they're terrorists.
[02:07:37.906 --> 02:07:39.388]  Mainstream news, I read it last hour.
[02:07:40.108 --> 02:07:41.850]  No, you're the threat, Michael Hayden.
[02:07:41.890 --> 02:07:43.071]  You people did this.
[02:07:43.171 --> 02:07:44.532]  You're your biggest danger.
[02:07:44.832 --> 02:07:45.713]  You're the problem.
[02:07:45.933 --> 02:08:04.842]  Remember, Christian nationalism, appeal to heaven, anyone who prays the rosary, anyone who's got a rosary, anyone who goes to church, anyone who believes in, and by the way, and I'll talk about this, believes in active Christianity, meaning actually bringing those Christian morals back into the public space.
[02:08:05.042 --> 02:08:09.404]  Look, they freaked out when I talked about this at CPAC back in February.
[02:08:09.684 --> 02:08:12.665]  Mark Posobiec is the Christian nationalist leader of America.
[02:08:12.905 --> 02:08:14.446]  He's going to overthrow democracy.
[02:08:14.786 --> 02:08:15.306]  Excuse me.
[02:08:15.567 --> 02:08:16.887]  This is a Christian nation.
[02:08:17.167 --> 02:08:18.808]  It's always been a Christian nation.
[02:08:18.988 --> 02:08:20.629]  It was a Christian nation at the founding.
[02:08:20.749 --> 02:08:22.169]  It remains a Christian nation.
[02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:33.000]   And the only reason you won't admit it is because you've You've taken it out of the public square and you've replaced it with pedophilia, you've replaced it with grooming, you've replaced it with trans, drag, woke.
[02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:37.325]  And I want to be clear, whatever the system attacks, we shouldn't run from.
[02:08:37.425 --> 02:08:38.567]  Scared, we should embrace.
[02:08:39.107 --> 02:08:42.672]  And I think that's what Trump's finally getting, TPUSA action, having me there.
[02:08:43.212 --> 02:08:45.634]  They already know this, but it's the understanding.
[02:08:45.654 --> 02:08:46.574]  That was cool, by the way.
[02:08:46.595 --> 02:08:47.275]  Well, thanks for doing that.
[02:08:47.615 --> 02:08:48.936]  The point is their understanding.
[02:08:48.996 --> 02:08:52.559]  Stop being afraid of being the rebel when Satan's in charge.
[02:08:52.639 --> 02:08:54.420]  If Satan's in control, you've got to be a rebel.
[02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:56.622]  Stop being afraid of Satan attacking you.
[02:08:56.822 --> 02:08:57.622]  They're a joke.
[02:08:57.862 --> 02:08:58.883]  They're a paper tiger.
[02:08:59.303 --> 02:09:02.065]  Resistance to tyranny is allegiance to God.
[02:09:03.026 --> 02:09:06.528]  Resistance to tyranny is obedience to God.
[02:09:07.529 --> 02:09:13.951]  These people want to set themselves up as unhuman demigods on this world.
[02:09:14.292 --> 02:09:15.712]  They want to rule over you.
[02:09:15.992 --> 02:09:17.433]  They want to rule over your lives.
[02:09:17.473 --> 02:09:18.933]  They want to rule over your families.
[02:09:19.193 --> 02:09:20.574]  They want to rule over your children.
[02:09:20.614 --> 02:09:30.918]  They want to take your children from you and put them with the drag queens, put them in foster homes, put them with gay parents, whatever it is, to indoctrinate them to hate you.
[02:09:31.198 --> 02:09:32.359]  Give me an overhead shot.
[02:09:32.180 --> 02:09:35.659]   they did it in China throughout the 90s. I got the book right here. They did it
[02:09:35.659 --> 02:09:39.939]   throughout China to the children and they used the children to torture the
[02:09:39.939 --> 02:09:43.099]   parents. That's how much they indoctrinated them, Alex, to torture and
[02:09:43.099 --> 02:09:47.019]   kill their own parents, their own flesh. And give me an overhead shot.
[02:09:47.019 --> 02:09:51.500]  ZZ Ping's own sister got beat to death in front of him.
[02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:50.361]  He defended it.
[02:09:50.381 --> 02:09:50.962]  He got promoted.
[02:09:50.982 --> 02:09:57.509]  The LGBTQIA pedophile 2S indoctrination makes kids homosexual study shows.
[02:09:57.869 --> 02:09:58.230]  No kidding.
[02:09:58.250 --> 02:09:59.551]  They're literally grooming them.
[02:09:59.631 --> 02:10:01.554]  Men in clown suits.
[02:10:02.194 --> 02:10:03.936]  And now how many of them have killed their own parents?
[02:10:04.317 --> 02:10:08.436]   massive again and again we see these these these indoctrinated groomed
[02:10:08.436 --> 02:10:11.587]  children turn trans and then they get what there was one uh...
[02:10:11.587 --> 02:10:14.646]   was it was in texas was you hot utah the only time this week there was
[02:10:14.646 --> 02:10:18.666]   just one of them is it was on the run and that was utah and then they said they
[02:10:18.666 --> 02:10:22.655]   did they 'cause they put out the a_p_d_ and they put out the a_p_d_ looking for
[02:10:22.655 --> 02:10:26.417]   a woman because the police are so totally indoctrinated that they said all of
[02:10:26.417 --> 02:10:30.737]   the description is a it's a woman they identify as a woman that's what everybody
[02:10:30.737 --> 02:10:33.667]   was looking for but it was actually a dude it was actually a dude who had
[02:10:33.667 --> 02:10:37.365]   killed his parents they couldn't even find him because the police didn't want
[02:10:37.365 --> 02:10:40.317]   to be accused of spreading hate speech when you're looking for a mass
[02:10:40.317 --> 02:10:43.697]   murderer of their own and we've got a call the bullying and say folks it's a
[02:10:43.697 --> 02:10:47.008]   hundred times worse We'll just run to the red states.
[02:10:47.048 --> 02:10:48.449]  And they say, we'll just run to the red states.
[02:10:48.609 --> 02:10:50.489]  How red is- Utah is the reddest state there is.
[02:10:51.069 --> 02:10:52.249]  Utah is completely red.
[02:10:52.329 --> 02:10:53.750]  It's like an 80% state.
[02:10:54.130 --> 02:10:56.030]  And they still can do this in Utah.
[02:10:56.050 --> 02:10:58.851]  They've got the transgenders killing their parents.
[02:10:59.051 --> 02:11:01.791]  They got the transgenders shooting up Christian schools.
[02:11:02.211 --> 02:11:04.592]  Understand, you're looking at a system.
[02:11:04.852 --> 02:11:08.433]  You're looking at a playbook that can run again and again.
[02:11:08.593 --> 02:11:09.793]  It is a cult of death.
[02:11:09.913 --> 02:11:12.734]  It is anti-humanity at its core.
[02:11:12.974 --> 02:11:20.659]   And it's anti-humanity In order to establish a new order of totalitarian total control and total dominance.
[02:11:20.879 --> 02:11:22.180]  They've used it again and again.
[02:11:22.361 --> 02:11:26.184]  Look, the names change, the technology changes, the level of warfare changes.
[02:11:26.464 --> 02:11:28.486]  It's not the 1930s anymore.
[02:11:28.746 --> 02:11:29.567]  It's not the 40s.
[02:11:29.627 --> 02:11:30.948]  It's not the 60s or 70s.
[02:11:31.048 --> 02:11:31.628]  It's a new world.
[02:11:31.649 --> 02:11:35.532]  Well, any modern eradication of fire ants or whatever it is attacks the biology.
[02:11:35.712 --> 02:11:35.932]  Yes.
[02:11:36.192 --> 02:11:37.654]  And that's all this is.
[02:11:37.694 --> 02:11:41.237]  So, if you had Jack Masovic to score, this is a football game.
[02:11:41.337 --> 02:11:42.638]  A biopsychological warfare.
[02:11:43.058 --> 02:11:45.219]  What, exactly what quarter are we in?
[02:11:45.259 --> 02:11:45.699]  Who's winning?
[02:11:47.941 --> 02:11:49.842]  Look, Alex, we're in the fourth corner.
[02:11:50.422 --> 02:11:54.984]  And this was predicted by the authors of the fourth turning.
[02:11:55.465 --> 02:11:58.746]  So we are at the 80-year inflection point right now.
[02:11:59.047 --> 02:12:01.148]  Remember, 80 years ago was what?
[02:12:02.388 --> 02:12:04.689]  D-Day, Normandy, World War II.
[02:12:04.770 --> 02:12:05.550]  That was the last order.
[02:12:05.770 --> 02:12:06.911]  That was the last turning.
[02:12:07.916 --> 02:12:13.017]  Now, 80 years plus, what happened on D-Day today, that's the day Steve Bannon was sentenced.
[02:12:13.437 --> 02:12:16.078]  That's the day where they said, you must report.
[02:12:16.358 --> 02:12:20.219]  You will conduct this 80 years to the day, June 6, 2024.
[02:12:22.019 --> 02:12:25.980]  So to all those people who say, oh, the Neil Howe, that's a bunch of pseudoscience.
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:28.140]  He called it 80 years to the day.
[02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:30.681]  I mean, humans go in cycles, and this is a mega-turning.
[02:12:31.101 --> 02:12:32.703]  So we are now in this.
[02:12:33.063 --> 02:12:34.144]  So we're in the churn.
[02:12:34.505 --> 02:12:38.048]  So the question is that when something... Now what Trump's trying to do...
[02:12:39.266 --> 02:12:43.468]  In a way that I think only he can do, is try to off-ramp this as much as possible.
[02:12:43.768 --> 02:12:44.809]  Because the turning is this.
[02:12:45.149 --> 02:12:56.854]  The turning is, we're going from a system of United States and Western-backed hegemony, so the Western Atlanticist collective West hegemony over the world, into an era of multi-polarity.
[02:12:57.195 --> 02:13:07.660]  Now it's very easy for that to be turned into warfare by demonizing the countries that are... And the Western Empire's attempts to maintain control has accelerated the move.
[02:13:07.940 --> 02:13:08.280]  Precisely.
[02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:17.842]  And so, if you try to push that, you will fuse, you will fuse all of those countries against you, because they're responding to the provocations.
[02:13:18.102 --> 02:13:21.063]  They're responding to saying, wait, we want our freedom, we want to be nation-state.
[02:13:21.083 --> 02:13:22.843]  Yeah, the obvious answer is the West should back off.
[02:13:23.103 --> 02:13:24.544]  So Trump, that's what Trump is trying to do.
[02:13:24.924 --> 02:13:27.864]  Trump doesn't want the United States to be a global empire.
[02:13:28.164 --> 02:13:31.185]  Trump is attempting to restore the nation-state.
[02:13:31.385 --> 02:13:44.312]   And because America, going back to the founding, as you just talked about, Alex, very presciently, George Washington and his band of rebels, and this was an incredibly, the Revolutionary Wars, and 4th of July is coming up of course, it was incredibly bloody.
[02:13:44.632 --> 02:13:51.617]  But not only was it a war for freedom, it wasn't a philosophical, you know, it was just this debate between a couple of aristocrats in the 1770s, no.
[02:13:52.918 --> 02:13:53.078]  No.
[02:13:53.379 --> 02:13:54.200]  It was a war.
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:55.261]  People died.
[02:13:55.522 --> 02:13:56.303]  People were killed.
[02:13:56.343 --> 02:13:57.364]  People were mutilated.
[02:13:57.444 --> 02:13:59.547]  People were tortured over this.
[02:13:59.988 --> 02:14:07.978]  And George Washington understood that the only way that America could survive was to unplug from the globalist system of his time.
[02:14:08.499 --> 02:14:10.980]  That was called at the time, the British Empire.
[02:14:11.220 --> 02:14:13.381]  That was the globalist international system.
[02:14:13.601 --> 02:14:22.464]  So what we've done since World War II is recreate a version of the British Empire that is sort of controlled by the U.S.
[02:14:22.544 --> 02:14:26.845]  infrastructure, that's got its tangled octopus tentacles all over the world.
[02:14:26.865 --> 02:14:30.647]  Well, Winston Churchill wrote three books, History of the British People, admitting all that.
[02:14:30.787 --> 02:14:31.127]  Oh, yeah.
[02:14:31.187 --> 02:14:33.688]  By the way, this is something I'm telling you.
[02:14:33.728 --> 02:14:36.129]  Did you just see the video of him with Jill today?
[02:14:36.169 --> 02:14:37.189]  He is blasted.
[02:14:38.527 --> 02:14:40.771]  I mean, he is out of his gourd, so... There's the handler.
[02:14:40.971 --> 02:14:41.993]  There's the handler right there.
[02:14:43.697 --> 02:14:44.998]  There's the handler right there.
[02:14:45.738 --> 02:14:46.398]  Jersey Jill.
[02:14:47.158 --> 02:14:48.419]  Jersey Jill.
[02:14:49.179 --> 02:14:50.640]  She knows this is her last stand, too.
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:51.760]  Oh, she loves it.
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:52.861]  Look how much she loves it.
[02:14:53.221 --> 02:14:53.741]  She loves it.
[02:14:53.781 --> 02:14:56.643]  I don't care that my husband is a squash.
[02:14:57.003 --> 02:14:59.404]  I don't care at all, because I get to wear my vote dress.
[02:14:59.484 --> 02:15:00.724]  Vote, vote, vote.
[02:15:00.784 --> 02:15:01.965]  Nobody's voting for you, Jersey Jill.
[02:15:01.985 --> 02:15:04.766]  She's like a cheerleader doing backflips at a football game.
[02:15:05.286 --> 02:15:06.327]  To her, it's all cutesy.
[02:15:07.327 --> 02:15:09.248]  He's like, I'll start World War III right now.
[02:15:11.048 --> 02:15:13.809]  Because she wants, look, she wants the trappings of office.
[02:15:13.869 --> 02:15:15.190]  She wants the power.
[02:15:15.210 --> 02:15:16.770]  She's addicted to that.
[02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:23.832]  Alex, when I was younger, when I was still a student and then I started working at the University of Pennsylvania, I would see them all the time at the galas.
[02:15:24.092 --> 02:15:32.715]  I would see Jill and this when, so Biden was the vice president then and she's the second lady of the United States and she's out there and he was her arm candy.
[02:15:32.975 --> 02:15:34.375]  He's the arm candy to her.
[02:15:34.656 --> 02:15:35.816]  She don't care about him.
[02:15:36.116 --> 02:15:39.177]  She wants to be the one that everybody comes to and Amy Gutmann.
[02:15:39.437 --> 02:15:41.158]  And she's not even worried.
[02:15:41.178 --> 02:15:48.403]  She doesn't even understand MIRV technology, or cruise missiles, or submarines.
[02:15:48.484 --> 02:15:50.705]  She just knows that she wants the good life.
[02:15:50.745 --> 02:15:54.268]  This is like in Hunger Games, where they've got the capital and then the districts.
[02:15:54.488 --> 02:16:03.274]  And so the capital is waging horrific warfare on all the districts, and in the capital they've got the pink hair, and they've got their glitzy parties.
[02:16:03.474 --> 02:16:04.295]  That's what she wants.
[02:16:04.475 --> 02:16:06.196]  She doesn't care about the people out there.
[02:16:06.456 --> 02:16:12.199]   She's going to be at that stand, and then she's going to go back And that's the exact historical thing of disconnected elites that inherit power.
[02:16:12.299 --> 02:16:12.720]  Precisely.
[02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:13.680]  Waging war on people.
[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:14.960]  Precisely, Alex.
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:22.123]  And this is part of the imbalance that you see in a lot of these aristocracies because they don't want to listen to the grievances of the people.
[02:16:22.423 --> 02:16:25.624]  And when they don't listen to the grievance of the people, who comes around?
[02:16:25.925 --> 02:16:26.585]  The tyrants.
[02:16:26.865 --> 02:16:28.486]  That's how Lenins get traction.
[02:16:28.766 --> 02:16:32.427]  That's how people like the communists in Spain get traction, that we're totally backed by the tyrants.
[02:16:32.447 --> 02:16:32.747]  Exactly.
[02:16:32.807 --> 02:16:37.089]  Don't the corrupt elites think in their lawyer vacuum they're going to conjure the tyrant?
[02:16:37.748 --> 02:16:46.091]  Right, they say, they say, we're gonna, and then they'll even think, by the way, okay, here, here comes, here come these, these, these crazies, they're bubbling up, but we're just going to use them.
[02:16:46.551 --> 02:16:49.192]  We're going to use these, these, these freaks.
[02:16:49.212 --> 02:16:52.113]  We're going to use Antifa and BLM and all these things.
[02:16:52.133 --> 02:16:55.314]  We're going to use them to target Alex Jones and Jack Posobiec and Donald Trump.
[02:16:55.514 --> 02:16:57.615]  We're going to use them to target patriots, target the people.
[02:16:57.915 --> 02:16:58.555]  That are in our way.
[02:16:58.595 --> 02:17:05.999]  But all of a sudden, and by the way, Joe Biden may have just found that out last night, that the Mensheviks always get slaughtered by the Bolsheviks.
[02:17:06.299 --> 02:17:08.820]  The Mensheviks are the first ones against the wall.
[02:17:08.860 --> 02:17:13.422]  It's always the younger generation of revolutionaries that takes out the older generation.
[02:17:13.682 --> 02:17:15.543]  Go look what Stalin did to Trotsky.
[02:17:15.803 --> 02:17:19.505]  Go ask Trotsky about the Mexican ice pick if you want to see how that works out.
[02:17:19.725 --> 02:17:26.728]  So the younger generation that becomes more brutal, that becomes more revolutionary, that becomes more, uh, that becomes more ruthless.
[02:17:27.128 --> 02:17:30.310]  They are the ones that then throw all these orders at the nation.
[02:17:30.289 --> 02:17:33.208]   And that's what we're watching right now, in real time today.
[02:17:33.208 --> 02:17:39.169]   Is detente and chivalry and republic is to protect everybody.
[02:17:39.169 --> 02:17:44.329]   And the globalists get rid of that for control against the regular establishment that wants
[02:17:44.329 --> 02:17:49.128]   prosperity, then they remove the ecosystem that made them successful.
[02:17:49.128 --> 02:18:06.371]   So, you have a situation there where in seeking to maintain total control, and the un-humans do this inherently, because they view anyone who is successful, anyone who has For lack of a better term, built something.
[02:18:06.391 --> 02:18:06.951]  As a threat.
[02:18:07.531 --> 02:18:08.131]  As a threat.
[02:18:08.552 --> 02:18:16.495]  And by the way, it's never, and we haven't even mentioned it, but it's never about equality and justice and equity.
[02:18:16.655 --> 02:18:18.236]  Those are all just marketing terms.
[02:18:18.496 --> 02:18:24.838]  Okay, those are just marketing terms that they use to cover up for the real purpose for their machinations.
[02:18:25.058 --> 02:18:28.500]  Then the real purpose is avarice, it is greed, it is hate.
[02:18:28.620 --> 02:18:29.440]  It's monopoly.
[02:18:29.500 --> 02:18:30.120]  It's monopoly.
[02:18:30.180 --> 02:18:30.741]  And that's the thing.
[02:18:31.581 --> 02:18:36.764]  And how can I, and more importantly, how can I destroy those people that have been successful?
[02:18:36.643 --> 02:18:42.683]   for everybody, a communist or a jacobin thinks of any competition as bad.
[02:18:42.683 --> 02:18:49.643]   And how can I, and more importantly, how can I destroy those people that have been successful?
[02:18:49.643 --> 02:18:52.482]   Because it's like you have, we were talking about this earlier, it's like you have a town
[02:18:52.482 --> 02:18:56.043]   and at one end of the town there's always that one house that's bigger than everybody
[02:18:56.574 --> 02:19:06.157]  And, you know, other people might think, oh, that's a great house, you know, and I want to have a house like that someday, so I'm going to work hard, or maybe I'll start a business, or maybe I'll do something to be successful.
[02:19:06.457 --> 02:19:09.038]  But then you've got another guy who's a rabble-rouser saying, you know what?
[02:19:10.117 --> 02:19:13.580]  Let's go kill that guy and his family and take all of their stuff.
[02:19:13.821 --> 02:19:16.103]  And that's the reason that you don't have more.
[02:19:16.163 --> 02:19:19.226]  That's the reason that you guys at the other end of town are living in crap.
[02:19:19.486 --> 02:19:21.428]  Because this guy stole it from you.
[02:19:21.468 --> 02:19:24.611]  The truth is the big house becomes an example of even better houses around it.
[02:19:24.891 --> 02:19:25.252]  Exactly.
[02:19:25.712 --> 02:19:33.594]  So, that could be, we could all build our houses up and have great towns, or even we found our own town, by the way, and then you get to be the leader of that town, but they don't want to think that way.
[02:19:33.794 --> 02:19:38.955]  They want to kill you and take your stuff, and they want to kill your children and rape your wife, and they will do anything.
[02:19:38.975 --> 02:19:43.076]  And again, because you're not evil, folks, you can't believe it, but it's a historical fact.
[02:19:43.156 --> 02:19:44.356]  These people exist.
[02:19:44.677 --> 02:19:50.038]  Because you can, and we go through chapter and verse, verse and chapter again, around the world.
[02:19:51.298 --> 02:19:53.941]  I'll give you another one.
[02:19:54.321 --> 02:19:55.102]  I can't wait to read it.
[02:19:55.122 --> 02:19:57.425]  It comes out in like five days, four days.
[02:19:57.885 --> 02:19:58.426]  Unhumans.
[02:19:58.466 --> 02:19:59.207]  Jack Posobiec.
[02:19:59.487 --> 02:20:00.388]  Everybody should get the book right now.
[02:20:00.408 --> 02:20:00.868]  Where do they get it?
[02:20:01.249 --> 02:20:04.492]  Unhumansbook.com, Amazon, Books A Million, Barnes & Noble.
[02:20:04.532 --> 02:20:05.213]  Until we're banned.
[02:20:05.253 --> 02:20:05.954]  Until we're banned.
[02:20:06.474 --> 02:20:07.875]  It's up on all those places.
[02:20:07.895 --> 02:20:10.677]  We've got a couple editions left of the Steve Bannon signed copies.
[02:20:10.977 --> 02:20:17.801]  Look, if you want to understand the playbook that's being run now, if you want to understand the system, we cracked their codes.
[02:20:18.081 --> 02:20:21.923]  And we give you, and most importantly, the system to fight back.
[02:20:21.943 --> 02:20:22.964]  Yeah, that's the key last chapter.
[02:20:22.984 --> 02:20:26.966]  I'm going to read it this weekend, but plus... A lot of people are telling me they read the last chapter first.
[02:20:27.707 --> 02:20:29.488]  Sending this number one is a big F you to them.
[02:20:30.068 --> 02:20:31.909]  Look, if this goes number one, they're going to be terrified.
[02:20:31.929 --> 02:20:32.770]  They're going to be even more terrified.
[02:20:32.790 --> 02:20:34.231]  It's going to go number one right now.
[02:20:34.251 --> 02:20:35.932]  Probably your show last night with 12 million viewers.
[02:20:37.085 --> 02:20:37.785]  It's been doing well.
[02:20:38.426 --> 02:20:39.106]  It's been doing well.
[02:20:39.246 --> 02:20:40.567]  You've done well, Lord Vader.
[02:20:40.587 --> 02:20:41.807]  Yes, yes.
[02:20:41.927 --> 02:20:43.568]  Good, good.
[02:20:44.028 --> 02:20:46.249]  Everything is proceeding as I have planned.
[02:20:46.749 --> 02:20:49.710]  Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen it.
[02:20:50.371 --> 02:20:51.991]  We'll be right back with Jack Posobiec.
[02:20:52.031 --> 02:20:54.112]  He's hosting the fourth hour.
[02:20:54.132 --> 02:20:54.672]  Uh-oh.
[02:20:54.813 --> 02:20:55.333]  Stay with us.
[02:20:56.837 --> 02:20:59.438]  Your cardiovascular system is under attack.
[02:20:59.999 --> 02:21:00.739]  Everybody knows it.
[02:21:01.239 --> 02:21:07.843]  And I've got in my hands two products that are absolutely insane when it comes to what they do for your body and your overall health.
[02:21:08.464 --> 02:21:11.465]  One of them is the highest grade fish oil you can find.
[02:21:11.926 --> 02:21:13.466]  Everybody knows how good fish oil is.
[02:21:13.707 --> 02:21:14.727]  This is as good as it gets.
[02:21:15.087 --> 02:21:19.770]  And when you purchase it at InfoWarsTore.com, you support the broadcast, a 360 win.
[02:21:20.130 --> 02:21:21.531]  And then of course, Nitric Boost.
[02:21:21.571 --> 02:21:23.152]  You've heard all the rage about this.
[02:21:23.172 --> 02:21:25.053]  A whole bunch of concentrated natural compounds.
[02:21:25.373 --> 02:21:28.714]  The clean out your blood and clean out your cardiovascular system.
[02:21:28.934 --> 02:21:34.016]  Everybody should be taking both of these products at MFullWarStore.com.
[02:21:34.376 --> 02:21:38.057]  And both of them, by the way, are 40% off for a limited time.
[02:21:38.297 --> 02:21:43.479]  Now, the sale's going to end in about two weeks because we've already sold out of more than half of these products since they came back in.
[02:21:43.739 --> 02:21:50.081]  But if you want to get Ultimate Fish Oil and Nitric Boost for 40% off, get them both today at MFullWarStore.com.
[02:21:50.301 --> 02:21:51.962]  I want to thank you all for supporting the broadcast.
[02:21:52.262 --> 02:21:55.443]  I want to thank you all for spreading the word, because without you, we are nothing.
[02:21:56.503 --> 02:21:59.903]  The year is 2024.
[02:22:01.584 --> 02:22:04.284]  America is on the verge of total war with Russia.
[02:22:05.804 --> 02:22:10.605]  International CIA-run pedophile rings are using blackmail for total control.
[02:22:11.765 --> 02:22:17.366]  But across the planet, humanity is awakening, and the center of the storm is America.
[02:22:18.086 --> 02:22:36.271]   So in the last month, the desperation to shut down InfoWars, to me, I don't really think about myself, not out of some great altruism, but I know I'm not that important in the full scheme, but I've been targeted because a major move is happening, a full coup against the last vestiges of the Republic because the people are waking up.
[02:22:36.631 --> 02:22:40.735]  So Jack, we just spent an hour and a half, you'll be hosting the next hour by yourself, doing an incredible job, I know.
[02:22:41.315 --> 02:22:49.105]  You just had the record 12.5, it's growing, I checked earlier, like 14 million views right now on your analysis last night of the debate.
[02:22:49.125 --> 02:22:50.206]  Congratulations on that.
[02:22:50.226 --> 02:22:50.927]  Thank you.
[02:22:50.947 --> 02:22:52.268]  CNN only had 3 million viewers.
[02:22:52.749 --> 02:22:55.132]  This just shows how weak they are and how people are looking for the truth.
[02:22:55.893 --> 02:22:57.795]  And they even tried to take down Rumble, but that didn't matter.
[02:22:58.616 --> 02:23:00.437]  But let's talk about- Thanks to Elon.
[02:23:00.738 --> 02:23:01.798]  Thanks to Elon.
[02:23:01.878 --> 02:23:03.139]  Let's talk- speak to that if you want.
[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:04.040]  Whatever you want to say.
[02:23:04.520 --> 02:23:06.442]  But let's speak to the positive stuff.
[02:23:06.462 --> 02:23:10.305]  We just- because any military operation against tyranny, we don't want to get overconfident.
[02:23:10.325 --> 02:23:16.029]  We've spent an hour and a half, before you got here an hour, just- we didn't even talk before you came on except for a few text messages.
[02:23:16.049 --> 02:23:16.829]  I was on the same page.
[02:23:17.250 --> 02:23:18.370]  Let's not start celebrating yet.
[02:23:18.391 --> 02:23:19.211]  We haven't won this yet.
[02:23:19.711 --> 02:23:22.286]   But- Yeah, they're going to try to replace Biden.
[02:23:22.306 --> 02:23:22.766]  They're doing that.
[02:23:22.806 --> 02:23:23.387]  We predicted it.
[02:23:24.028 --> 02:23:26.411]  But at the same time, it does show how weak they are.
[02:23:26.591 --> 02:23:27.432]  Look in their eyes.
[02:23:28.093 --> 02:23:29.094]  They are collapsing.
[02:23:29.255 --> 02:23:31.117]  It's like they're running away right now.
[02:23:31.137 --> 02:23:36.023]  I'm sure they'll strike back, but I think we should also spend some time...
[02:23:36.602 --> 02:23:41.402]   Well now they tried to prop up Biden, say he's the smartest guy in the world, and now they've totally turned on him.
[02:23:41.402 --> 02:23:43.992]  We've got a compilation we'll post on Exxon, it'll go viral.
[02:23:43.992 --> 02:23:45.802]  We'll premiere it here in a moment.
[02:23:45.802 --> 02:23:50.602]   But spend a few minutes though, for everybody out there, on the positive that you saw last night.
[02:23:50.602 --> 02:23:56.002]   Ladies and gentlemen out there in the audience, you made that happen last night.
[02:23:56.144 --> 02:24:04.447]  You have brought this regime to the brink of their precipice of full and total collapse.
[02:24:04.867 --> 02:24:19.313]  We would not be here if not for the people specifically of the Alex Jones audience, if not for the people of the Patriot Movement, if not for Alex Jones for 30 years speaking out of the ills of this regime.
[02:24:20.053 --> 02:24:24.357]  We would not be here without the support that you have given to him.
[02:24:24.377 --> 02:24:27.339]  Exactly, the people did the groundwork.
[02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:29.862]  This was unthinkable 30 years ago.
[02:24:30.102 --> 02:24:37.268]  It was unthinkable that a movement could come in through a populist lane, not left.
[02:24:37.688 --> 02:24:39.469]  Not right, but up and down.
[02:24:39.930 --> 02:24:41.871]  Globalist versus nationalist.
[02:24:41.931 --> 02:24:44.713]  Do we want to be a global empire of the New World Order?
[02:24:44.993 --> 02:24:49.576]  Or do we want to be the nation state that America was always founded to be?
[02:24:50.036 --> 02:24:53.018]  Did we want to check out from the global order?
[02:24:53.258 --> 02:24:56.100]  That was what the 4th of July was all about.
[02:24:56.321 --> 02:24:59.182]  That's what 1776 was all about.
[02:24:59.262 --> 02:25:01.404]  Control of your own destiny.
[02:25:01.444 --> 02:25:06.988]  And you can't have control of your own destiny when you are completely involved in the destiny.
[02:25:07.608 --> 02:25:09.188]  It's an empire 4,000 miles away.
[02:25:09.228 --> 02:25:09.488]  Yes.
[02:25:09.928 --> 02:25:10.649]  It's impossible.
[02:25:10.689 --> 02:25:11.849]  It's completely impossible.
[02:25:11.869 --> 02:25:12.529]  There's no way.
[02:25:12.549 --> 02:25:15.890]  So we're reliving the American destiny and we're having a major victory.
[02:25:16.430 --> 02:25:20.391]  In a way, in a way, because if you take the fourth turnings back, it actually does give you 1776.
[02:25:20.611 --> 02:25:39.435]   In a small way, the thread of the Americanism, of Valley Forge, the valor of what happened during there that winter when Washington's forces were starving, when they had nothing, when the British had taken New York and Trenton and Philadelphia and New York.
[02:25:39.455 --> 02:25:41.215]  Their shoes fell apart.
[02:25:41.255 --> 02:25:43.616]  They were made out of leather and they kept fighting.
[02:25:43.656 --> 02:25:44.796]  Well, they stayed out there.
[02:25:45.036 --> 02:25:46.417]  They stayed through that winter.
[02:25:46.677 --> 02:25:56.740]  And then after that, they launched the crossing of the Delaware and took the flight to the British in Trenton and then all the way into Princeton, too, by the way.
[02:25:56.780 --> 02:25:58.380]  Princeton University, as a matter of fact.
[02:25:59.020 --> 02:26:01.961]  And they were able to be victorious.
[02:26:02.201 --> 02:26:04.042]  By the way, it's not just American historians.
[02:26:04.662 --> 02:26:11.207]  When Washington, with a few thousand troops, attacks a German Hessian force three times the size, right before dawn, the Germans panicked.
[02:26:11.227 --> 02:26:16.010]  They said, we had a thousand people shooting at him at 200 yards away and we couldn't hit him.
[02:26:16.130 --> 02:26:17.031]  They were, like, scared.
[02:26:17.591 --> 02:26:20.473]  And Washington would say it was the hand of Providence.
[02:26:20.893 --> 02:26:23.275]  That it was the hand of Providence that came through.
[02:26:23.315 --> 02:26:25.317]  There were a bunch of times, by the way, that that happened to him.
[02:26:25.617 --> 02:26:28.739]  More than 20 of his troops froze to death that night.
[02:26:28.959 --> 02:26:29.119]  Yeah.
[02:26:29.399 --> 02:26:36.024]  During the French-Indian Wars, there were a number of times where Washington was shot out when he was riding horse, and they would go through his petticoat.
[02:26:36.325 --> 02:26:42.610]  And they would go through the coat, and he would come out, and there would be bullet holes from the shot, from the grape shot that went through, and it never hit him.
[02:26:43.070 --> 02:26:43.871]  And it never hit him.
[02:26:43.931 --> 02:26:55.880]  And the Indians would tell stories of, we've always had a prophecy that there would be a great leader who would come against us, who would never be able to be taken out in battle.
[02:26:57.162 --> 02:26:58.362]  It's amazing, it actually happened.
[02:26:58.842 --> 02:26:59.803]  God was protecting him.
[02:27:01.043 --> 02:27:01.943]  There's no other question.
[02:27:01.983 --> 02:27:07.965]  There's no other question that God raises people up in certain places at certain times.
[02:27:08.185 --> 02:27:17.727]  If you read the Bible, and it's very clear in the Bible that God raises up imperfect vessels, that he works through imperfect vessels.
[02:27:18.127 --> 02:27:22.968]  Saul, King David, turning Paul, Saul of Tarsus.
[02:27:23.048 --> 02:27:23.669]  Saul of Tarsus.
[02:27:25.529 --> 02:27:36.851]  And so God uses this again and again and again to show His power in order to turn the imperfect into a vessel for the perfect.
[02:27:37.291 --> 02:27:44.573]  And so when you understand the animating situation that we're in right now, because there's no question, there's no question... What happened at Trenton?
[02:27:44.733 --> 02:27:47.933]  Literally a thousand troops had already gotten out of several thousand.
[02:27:47.953 --> 02:27:49.214]  They're all shooting right at him.
[02:27:49.234 --> 02:27:49.734]  They can't hit him.
[02:27:49.754 --> 02:27:50.354]  They panicked.
[02:27:51.061 --> 02:27:51.662]  They panic.
[02:27:51.802 --> 02:27:52.423]  They break.
[02:27:52.763 --> 02:27:53.444]  They flee.
[02:27:53.684 --> 02:27:54.886]  He's able to get the beachhead.
[02:27:54.906 --> 02:27:55.987]  He's able to cross over.
[02:27:56.047 --> 02:28:00.272]  So if you don't think that God has a hand in all of this, then you haven't been paying attention.
[02:28:00.313 --> 02:28:07.001]  There's no reason that they would tar- and if they weren't worried about God, they wouldn't be targeting all the Christians and all the believers, by the way.
[02:28:07.041 --> 02:28:09.704]   If they weren't worried about God, if God was Because they're scared of that power.
[02:28:09.724 --> 02:28:10.484]  They don't have any of this.
[02:28:10.524 --> 02:28:13.146]  They're scared of the one power.
[02:28:13.586 --> 02:28:17.408]  What scares the demons more than anything else is God.
[02:28:17.668 --> 02:28:23.311]  Because as creations, they are still subject to the orders of the Creator.
[02:28:23.531 --> 02:28:26.433]  They're still subject, even as demons.
[02:28:26.553 --> 02:28:29.015]  In the Bible, the devil has to go to God and ask permission.
[02:28:29.155 --> 02:28:29.315]  Right.
[02:28:30.095 --> 02:28:36.180]  He has to go to God, and so he must obey a direct command from God.
[02:28:36.220 --> 02:28:40.183]  There's no way around that, as a demon, as a member of that class, the fallen angel.
[02:28:40.223 --> 02:28:48.450]  So even though they have their ability to rebel, they still can't... They only have ability when we give up God and let them manipulate us.
[02:28:48.530 --> 02:29:06.185]   Well, so, and this is actually, to get it on a theological level, When the fallen angels and demons and Satan realized that they couldn't take the throne on head-on, they try that, they lose, they fail, they say, okay, but what we can do then is, God has this experiment that he's working on here on Earth.
[02:29:06.546 --> 02:29:13.414]  And that experiment is humanity, and he wants humans and he gave humans free will, and he gave humans animating liberty.
[02:29:13.854 --> 02:29:28.020]  And they said, well, if we can weaken free will, and if we can weaken their connection to God, we can defeat God through weakening His creations, through weakening their connection in their souls and in their heart to God.
[02:29:28.321 --> 02:29:32.042]  And so that's the way that they wage war against God now.
[02:29:32.402 --> 02:29:35.784]  They wage war on His creations, which is all of us.
[02:29:36.244 --> 02:29:37.945]  That's why they're so out for you.
[02:29:38.145 --> 02:29:39.205]  They don't care about you.
[02:29:39.405 --> 02:29:40.386]  They don't care about your children.
[02:29:40.426 --> 02:29:41.466]  They hate God.
[02:29:41.486 --> 02:29:41.807]  That's right.
[02:29:42.867 --> 02:29:44.588]  The sacrifice of a child is to hurt God.
[02:29:44.728 --> 02:29:45.409]  It's to hurt God.
[02:29:45.849 --> 02:29:46.630]  It's to hurt God.
[02:29:47.150 --> 02:29:49.232]  Because that's their ultimate goal.
[02:29:49.432 --> 02:29:59.399]  So the ultimate goal through the abortions, their ultimate goal through the deaths in war, their ultimate goal through launching new wars, is to hurt God by destroying and damaging his people.
[02:29:59.419 --> 02:30:01.501]  You look at Ukraine and Russia, that's a Christian war.
[02:30:01.741 --> 02:30:03.222]  That's two Christian nations.
[02:30:03.242 --> 02:30:04.683]  It's Russians killing Russians.
[02:30:05.084 --> 02:30:06.425]  It's Slavs versus Slavs.
[02:30:06.465 --> 02:30:08.566]  There's a whole bunch of us, but yes.
[02:30:10.627 --> 02:30:13.751]  You've got a group of people, and people know, you know, my wife is from that area.
[02:30:13.951 --> 02:30:19.016]  You've got a group of people that have an indelibly tied history.
[02:30:19.276 --> 02:30:21.058]  It's basically a civil war, is what I'm getting at.
[02:30:21.339 --> 02:30:24.362]  It's a civil war that never should have happened.
[02:30:24.642 --> 02:30:28.186]  It's a civil war from brother on brother, cousin on cousin.
[02:30:28.206 --> 02:30:30.849]  You've got people by the... When I say Ukraine's Russia, I know the history.
[02:30:30.889 --> 02:30:32.090]  Russia was founded in Ukraine.
[02:30:32.210 --> 02:30:33.151]  You're talking about the Kievan Rus.
[02:30:33.271 --> 02:30:33.472]  Yeah.
[02:30:33.712 --> 02:30:39.861]  You're talking about the Kievan Rus and the fact that they all stem, Eastern Europe, Eastern Slavs, all stem from that exact same root.
[02:30:39.881 --> 02:30:43.025]  I mean, this was the same country up until about 30 years ago.
[02:30:43.406 --> 02:30:47.592]  So it's a country of people, it's all... Yeah, why did Lenin give up Ukraine from Russia?
[02:30:49.562 --> 02:31:10.150]  So, the reason that Lenin does this, and we actually, we get into this a little bit in the book, to be honest, is that he was trying to, because remember, he was against the imperial, so he was against the aristocrats, he was against the Romanovs, he was against the family, and so this idea was that he would take all the disparate groups that were in the Russian Empire and say, I'm going to give you freedom.
[02:31:10.570 --> 02:31:12.611]  I'm going to give you freedom in a national movement.
[02:31:12.851 --> 02:31:21.375]  So, the Ukrainians at this point, who are really the Galatians, in what is now Western Ukraine, centered around Lvov, you said, I'm going to give you freedom, I'm going to give you your own country.
[02:31:22.016 --> 02:31:32.601]  And to the Finno-Baltics, and to the Siberians, and to the Tatars, and the Kazakhs, and again, and again, and again, the Bulgars, all throughout various points of Russia.
[02:31:32.881 --> 02:31:40.466]  Now of course, none of them actually get so, because your freedom only comes through the United System of Soviet Republics.
[02:31:40.686 --> 02:31:44.829]  And through the United Socialist Soviet Republics, the USSR, you have my freedom.
[02:31:45.129 --> 02:31:51.714]  And my freedom comes through you bowing down to the USSR and to the communist state.
[02:31:51.994 --> 02:32:02.501]  So yes, he administratively does this as a trick to say I'm anti-imperial on the front end, but then on the back end he makes them all submit to the USSR.
[02:32:04.222 --> 02:32:16.133]  And now you have a communist empire, where when Lenin goes down, it's really Stalin who comes in, because when he looks at World War II, his idea is, how do I expand my communist holdings?
[02:32:16.414 --> 02:32:18.356]  How do I get all of Eastern Europe?
[02:32:18.596 --> 02:32:19.737]  How do I get all of China?
[02:32:19.797 --> 02:32:21.058]  How do I get Korea?
[02:32:21.298 --> 02:32:22.179]  How do I get more?
[02:32:22.459 --> 02:32:25.722]  And then Stalin goes and he gets FDR!
[02:32:26.403 --> 02:32:36.797]  To eat out of his hand and he gets FDR who's just as invalid and decrepit and completely resigning, mentally gone as Joe Biden is right now.
[02:32:36.878 --> 02:32:41.364]  Churchill tries a little bit at the end to put Stalin in a box, but it doesn't work.
[02:32:41.683 --> 02:32:44.884]   It doesn't work completely because Churchill's going on along with this as well.
[02:32:44.884 --> 02:32:49.022]   So Stalin is the one who ends up coming out as the major victor of World War II.
[02:32:49.022 --> 02:32:52.683]   You have communism and he tried to get Spain, but they were stopped by a guy named General
[02:32:52.683 --> 02:32:54.243]  Franco who we talk about in the book.
[02:32:54.243 --> 02:32:58.923]  And the left will love Russia until 1991, 1999.
[02:32:58.923 --> 02:33:03.573]   And once they move away, now they- Raskin's father, Jamie Raskin, who was the head of the Jan
[02:33:03.573 --> 02:33:06.603]   6 Committee, he was the head of the impeachers.
[02:33:06.603 --> 02:33:11.243]   He was the chief, the chief inquisitor for all of these hearings.
[02:33:11.243 --> 02:33:17.442]   Jamie Raskin's father, Marcus Raskin, was a chief Bolshevik collaborator.
[02:33:17.442 --> 02:33:22.802]   He was a guy in Washington, D.C. who said, "We need to work with the Soviets.
[02:33:22.802 --> 02:33:25.183]  We need to put together these coalitions.
[02:33:25.183 --> 02:33:27.483]  We need to find ways to work together."
[02:33:27.483 --> 02:33:31.933]   And the entire thing- And now Russia, how much has Russia thrown off the old Bolshevik
[02:33:31.933 --> 02:33:32.603]  system?
[02:33:33.219 --> 02:33:37.304]  So the Bolsheviks don't really exist in any meaningful sense anymore in Russia.
[02:33:37.424 --> 02:33:42.169]  Putin is clearly in the vein of the previous system.
[02:33:42.189 --> 02:33:45.453]  By the way, look how evil Raskin's dad looks.
[02:33:45.473 --> 02:33:46.194]  Just put him up there.
[02:33:46.214 --> 02:33:46.514]  Keep going.
[02:33:48.680 --> 02:33:49.240]  And there you go.
[02:33:49.881 --> 02:33:50.601]  So there you go.
[02:33:51.181 --> 02:33:52.502]  You're looking at a Bolshevik, folks.
[02:33:52.802 --> 02:33:54.223]  These are the Bolsheviks.
[02:33:54.423 --> 02:33:57.304]  And a lot of these guys, by the way, end up being Trotskyites.
[02:33:57.825 --> 02:33:59.866]  They end up being people like Victoria Nuland, by the way.
[02:33:59.926 --> 02:34:01.987]  Her family was thrown out of the Odessa region.
[02:34:02.227 --> 02:34:05.268]  Victoria Nuland's family was thrown out of the Odessa region by Stalin.
[02:34:05.489 --> 02:34:08.290]  That's why they're obsessed with Russia so much.
[02:34:08.390 --> 02:34:09.030]  Does he kick their ass?
[02:34:09.050 --> 02:34:09.771]  That's why they want their rights.
[02:34:09.791 --> 02:34:13.713]  So it's not that they're not communists, they're just a different faction of the communists.
[02:34:13.733 --> 02:34:14.813]  They're Trotskyites, not Stalinists.
[02:34:14.833 --> 02:34:16.214]  So I want to play this clip.
[02:34:16.234 --> 02:34:16.874]  We put it together.
[02:34:16.954 --> 02:34:23.817]  You were mentioning it an hour and a half ago about how you said you put a compilation together of them worshipping Biden months ago.
[02:34:24.117 --> 02:34:25.278]  He's the smartest guy in the world.
[02:34:25.538 --> 02:34:26.298]  Now he's the dumbest.
[02:34:26.318 --> 02:34:28.339]  This is the 360 they just did.
[02:34:28.399 --> 02:34:28.880]  Here's the clip.
[02:34:30.500 --> 02:34:39.858]   Listen, if anybody in America thinks that that was even close to being an OK debate by Joe Biden, I'm living in a parallel universe.
[02:34:40.238 --> 02:34:44.481]  The universal reaction was somewhere approaching panic.
[02:34:44.681 --> 02:34:50.444]  Right now as we speak, there is a deep, a wide, and a very aggressive panic in the Democratic Party.
[02:34:50.605 --> 02:34:52.966]  There's a full-on panic about this performance.
[02:34:53.386 --> 02:34:54.547]  Biden had a terrible night.
[02:34:54.687 --> 02:34:56.168]  He could not land a thought.
[02:34:56.688 --> 02:35:00.511]  Not even in the closing statement, which is something, that's the easiest part.
[02:35:00.951 --> 02:35:04.293]  Write down a few words, go through, go through the thoughts.
[02:35:04.844 --> 02:35:10.407]  That was an unmitigated disaster for President Biden from the second he walked out to the closing statement.
[02:35:10.607 --> 02:35:11.988]  Again, it was terrible.
[02:35:12.268 --> 02:35:13.709]  It was terrible.
[02:35:13.809 --> 02:35:14.469]  That was painful.
[02:35:14.890 --> 02:35:16.991]  There's no way to spin it.
[02:35:17.251 --> 02:35:20.313]  This was a debate that your campaign wanted.
[02:35:20.373 --> 02:35:22.854]  You pushed for this debate at this moment.
[02:35:23.715 --> 02:35:32.860]  Obviously, I mean, you can't honestly say, I mean, can you say that you are not concerned at all having watched the president's performance tonight?
[02:35:34.795 --> 02:35:35.796]  It was a slow start.
[02:35:35.836 --> 02:35:36.877]  That's obvious to everyone.
[02:35:36.897 --> 02:35:38.218]  I'm not going to debate that point.
[02:35:38.538 --> 02:35:41.480]  Yeah, look, it was a really disappointing debate performance from Joe Biden.
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:43.642]  I don't think there's any other way to slice it.
[02:35:43.782 --> 02:35:47.445]  President Biden seeming extremely feeble, seeming extremely weak.
[02:35:47.685 --> 02:35:55.331]  The only job that Joe Biden had last night was to reassure America that he was not too old to do the job.
[02:35:56.678 --> 02:35:57.398]  And he failed.
[02:35:57.858 --> 02:36:00.179]  Joe Biden's job was to reassure them tonight.
[02:36:00.799 --> 02:36:07.042]  His job was to calm his party, to make them feel that, yes, I can do this.
[02:36:07.222 --> 02:36:08.602]  I have four more years in me.
[02:36:09.042 --> 02:36:13.744]  I have the ability and the stamina and the strength to do four more years.
[02:36:14.184 --> 02:36:14.944]  He did not do that.
[02:36:15.384 --> 02:36:17.085]  Joe, you did such a great job.
[02:36:17.125 --> 02:36:19.006]  You answered every question.
[02:36:23.875 --> 02:36:27.239]  And let me ask the crowd, what did Trump do?
[02:36:27.259 --> 02:36:27.440]  LIE!
[02:36:30.564 --> 02:36:33.508]  This cannot be real life!
[02:36:36.107 --> 02:36:36.908]  Alright, let's stop there.
[02:36:37.068 --> 02:36:38.710]  I wasn't clear with the crew hours ago.
[02:36:38.750 --> 02:36:39.731]  I thought I was.
[02:36:40.051 --> 02:36:47.438]  I want the clips, we played it last week, of them worshipping him, saying Joe Scarborough, he's the smartest guy in the world, he's so smart.
[02:36:47.478 --> 02:36:48.319]  Scarborough's attack.
[02:36:48.899 --> 02:36:50.221]  This is the best Biden.
[02:36:50.441 --> 02:36:51.082]  The best Biden.
[02:36:51.122 --> 02:36:52.503]  Check it on X. This is the best Biden.
[02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:59.181]  And then you put that in front of that clip to show the 360.
[02:36:59.681 --> 02:37:06.003]  And they kept saying, they kept saying that there was this, like, that there was a secret Biden that we couldn't see in public for somehow.
[02:37:06.163 --> 02:37:09.064]  They said, well, when I have dealings with him, he knows the issues.
[02:37:09.264 --> 02:37:09.944]  He knows the issues.
[02:37:09.984 --> 02:37:11.705]  That's because that's not what my sources have been saying.
[02:37:11.945 --> 02:37:19.767]  My sources were saying from the start that when the Israel war kicked off, that Biden was in briefings and he was getting confused between Israel and Ukraine.
[02:37:19.787 --> 02:37:22.648]  Well, no, he said the Mexican president was taking Palestine.
[02:37:22.728 --> 02:37:25.450]  He said the Mexican President was fighting Palestine.
[02:37:25.470 --> 02:37:26.691]  He said all this stuff.
[02:37:26.771 --> 02:37:27.551]  The guy does it.
[02:37:27.591 --> 02:37:29.473]  He actually thanked North Carolina last night.
[02:37:30.033 --> 02:37:41.000]  When he was at his post-debate, he did that thing with Jill, when she's up there talking and he's walking around like a kindergartner, special needs kindergartner, and he goes, thank you, North Carolina.
[02:37:41.020 --> 02:37:42.381]  He said, no, he wasn't in North Carolina today.
[02:37:42.401 --> 02:37:43.062]  He was still in Georgia.
[02:37:43.956 --> 02:37:45.357]  You guys have no idea where he's going.
[02:37:46.197 --> 02:37:47.238]  There is no secret, Biden.
[02:37:47.298 --> 02:37:48.779]  They were lying to you.
[02:37:49.139 --> 02:37:52.501]  They were lying to you until the kill switch was flipped.
[02:37:52.781 --> 02:37:56.903]  And that's what this montage, when we get it together, and we will, and I'm... Yeah, and we're gonna do the montage.
[02:37:57.043 --> 02:37:58.604]  It's, it's, it's... That's what it reveals.
[02:37:58.624 --> 02:37:59.504]  This is the best Biden.
[02:37:59.645 --> 02:38:00.405]  Just search that.
[02:38:00.765 --> 02:38:01.966]  This is the best Biden.
[02:38:03.248 --> 02:38:10.150]  Scarborough and a bunch of others, we played the clip last week, it was like seven, eight clips, and then show them saying he's got, or he's an idiot now.
[02:38:10.210 --> 02:38:13.751]  What it proves is that regime media takes orders.
[02:38:14.031 --> 02:38:19.732]  That regime media is, like Alex, you and I don't talk beforehand, or we're like, oh, what's your sense of this going to be?
[02:38:19.792 --> 02:38:21.413]  What's your take on that story?
[02:38:21.433 --> 02:38:21.953]  Do you agree with this?
[02:38:21.973 --> 02:38:23.833]  No, we could disagree, we could say whatever we want.
[02:38:23.853 --> 02:38:26.894]  Yeah, no, you're smart, you're interesting, you're going to come on, we're going to have a discussion.
[02:38:27.294 --> 02:38:35.625]  And that's what an actual conversation is like, of a couple of people that are trying to put something together, trying to work through history, trying to understand these deep hidden secrets.
[02:38:35.986 --> 02:38:36.947]  But not the other side.
[02:38:37.188 --> 02:38:43.836]  Regime media, corporate media... By the way, when they sued me in the last six years, in depositions they go, who's paying you, who gives you orders?
[02:38:44.542 --> 02:38:49.025]  And I said nobody, and the judges defaulted me, saying, we know you're getting orders.
[02:38:49.325 --> 02:38:50.226]  That's what the judges said.
[02:38:50.586 --> 02:38:52.587]  They said, where's the documents?
[02:38:52.727 --> 02:39:02.853]  When I've gotten reached out to a number of times by the feds and their buddies, they always say, so did President Trump, did the White House tell you to tweet that?
[02:39:03.154 --> 02:39:04.674]  Did the White House tell you to put that out?
[02:39:04.694 --> 02:39:06.055]  I said, well, why did you?
[02:39:06.075 --> 02:39:07.976]  They said, no, I did that on my own.
[02:39:07.997 --> 02:39:09.097]  So why did you post that meme?
[02:39:09.177 --> 02:39:09.858]  I said, I like memes.
[02:39:11.118 --> 02:39:11.818]  I just like memes.
[02:39:11.898 --> 02:39:14.199]  But see, they only take orders.
[02:39:14.379 --> 02:39:15.200]  I'm a creative person.
[02:39:15.220 --> 02:39:16.280]  You're like a real boy.
[02:39:16.300 --> 02:39:17.620]  You're not Pinocchio that's wooden.
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:19.841]  They're like, hey, how are you doing your own thing?
[02:39:19.921 --> 02:39:26.063]  But because they're they're telling on themselves, because that's how the media on their side operates.
[02:39:26.263 --> 02:39:32.849]  By the way, this is why when the Ukraine war kicked off, that Biden said, we're going to sanction all the oligarchs.
[02:39:32.869 --> 02:39:36.632]  And when we sanction the oligarchs, the oligarchs will go to Putin and take him out of power.
[02:39:36.732 --> 02:39:38.673]  And they'll say, that's going to work.
[02:39:38.814 --> 02:39:43.698]  You go after the oligarchs, you ratchet up the costs on them, you ratchet up the tensions, they'll put pressure on him.
[02:39:44.238 --> 02:39:49.422]  And everyone on the Russian side said, you don't understand that that's not how our system works.
[02:39:49.883 --> 02:39:53.606]  Our oligarchs over there only have power through Putin.
[02:39:53.966 --> 02:40:00.808]  They only have power because they've been appointed, okay, you're going to run the oil and gas, you're going to run the military, you're going to run this, you're going to run that, the Purgosian and all this.
[02:40:01.188 --> 02:40:02.308]  They're run through the oligarch.
[02:40:02.988 --> 02:40:06.249]  It's our system is the one that's controlled by the oligarchs.
[02:40:06.749 --> 02:40:11.991]  Our system is the one... Exactly, in Russia, it's not perfect, it's run with the central system.
[02:40:12.411 --> 02:40:13.651]  Here, we're actually run by oligarchs.
[02:40:13.931 --> 02:40:14.392]  Right.
[02:40:14.492 --> 02:40:15.873]  We're the oligarchy.
[02:40:16.174 --> 02:40:20.539]  We're the ones who are run by the people who are operating in secret.
[02:40:20.599 --> 02:40:22.120]  We're the ones with the strings.
[02:40:22.381 --> 02:40:23.882]  So now let's talk about Elon Musk.
[02:40:24.003 --> 02:40:24.763]  I mean, look.
[02:40:24.904 --> 02:40:27.246]  Well, Elon Musk is the rogue.
[02:40:27.807 --> 02:40:28.428]  He's the rogue.
[02:40:28.848 --> 02:40:32.170]  I think he, regardless of whether he's good or bad, he sees the old orders going down.
[02:40:32.490 --> 02:40:33.090]  He's joining us.
[02:40:33.130 --> 02:40:41.734]  Whether he's good or bad, it's a symbol of our victory over tyranny that he is completely coming over to- And now you're seeing more and more people following in his wake.
[02:40:42.055 --> 02:40:48.198]  A lot of these guys who have gotten a lot of this Silicon Valley money, people who are from- Record contributions, finally.
[02:40:48.258 --> 02:40:50.579]  Trump mainly gets small contributions, but now he's getting Silicon Valley.
[02:40:50.619 --> 02:40:50.979]  Exactly.
[02:40:51.219 --> 02:40:52.600]  People say, oh, Musk isn't perfect.
[02:40:52.900 --> 02:40:56.082]  He's an example for everybody to bandwagon for us.
[02:40:56.142 --> 02:40:56.762]  No, he's real.
[02:40:57.698 --> 02:40:59.901]  And by the way, you judge a tree by its fruits as Christ said.
[02:40:59.921 --> 02:41:02.164]  I'm not here to defend Musk, okay?
[02:41:02.204 --> 02:41:02.905]  I'm not a Musk guy.
[02:41:03.285 --> 02:41:08.332]  The point is, they, the system, this is a sign of the system's weakness that he's done this.
[02:41:10.492 --> 02:41:14.555]  He's realizing that the current system is crumbling.
[02:41:15.156 --> 02:41:16.978]  And this is a guy who knows how to look around corners.
[02:41:17.158 --> 02:41:18.239]  He's always known how to do this.
[02:41:18.699 --> 02:41:27.466]  And so, he says, this current system is crumbling, and I want to be the first guy out of the gate to be on the ground floor to build whatever comes.
[02:41:27.486 --> 02:41:27.907]  Exactly.
[02:41:28.527 --> 02:41:29.508]  That's what he's doing.
[02:41:29.528 --> 02:41:31.650]  Yeah, the old system's coming to an end, forth turning.
[02:41:32.050 --> 02:41:35.033]  He wants to exactly, and he's siding with us because we're the future.
[02:41:35.313 --> 02:41:38.155]  Right, because I'm going to side with the side that is forward-looking.
[02:41:38.415 --> 02:41:42.497]  I'm going to side with the side that is, and we, you and I talked about this with him on that X Spaces.
[02:41:42.697 --> 02:41:44.638]  We said, we are Team Humanity.
[02:41:44.918 --> 02:41:45.619]  We are the team.
[02:41:45.679 --> 02:41:46.259]  And he said, I agree.
[02:41:46.339 --> 02:41:47.160]  He said, that's the name.
[02:41:47.340 --> 02:41:49.081]  That's the name right there, Team Humanity.
[02:41:49.141 --> 02:41:52.323]  So we're talking about the un-humans, but we're Team Humanity.
[02:41:52.343 --> 02:41:56.105]  And this is the response that people have to understand, is that we are human.
[02:41:56.385 --> 02:41:58.066]  We want to remain human.
[02:41:58.106 --> 02:42:00.627]  We want our children to be human.
[02:42:00.727 --> 02:42:01.568]  We like ourselves.
[02:42:01.988 --> 02:42:02.689]  I think we're obsolete.
[02:42:03.029 --> 02:42:07.175]  So talk about that space of two and a half hours with Musk we did, and subsequent times.
[02:42:07.957 --> 02:42:13.444]  So explain the un-humans that say we're un-human, they're really the un-humans, versus Team Humanity.
[02:42:13.464 --> 02:42:14.927]  How do you define that key core?
[02:42:15.401 --> 02:42:46.645]   Well the key core is very simple and it's it it it comes with it goes back to what I was talking about about the town it it is it is do you want to be the type of person who builds things who goes out into the world and adventures and discovers and decides to take that to take what you've learned and apply that to doing something positive in the world and creating something creating a family creating a legacy creating even if it on the smaller level level, just creating a church group or creating a civic
[02:42:46.645 --> 02:42:50.205]   group, the civil, civic society that we used to have in this country.
[02:42:50.205 --> 02:42:52.605]  Or roofing your house or planting a garden.
[02:42:52.605 --> 02:42:58.285]   Precisely. A garden is a great example. Fantasma Tanya is an incredible gardener, right? And
[02:42:58.285 --> 02:43:04.344]   those are things that are positive and future-looking. The unhuman, the unhuman, these disgusting
[02:43:04.344 --> 02:43:09.804]   little Brian Stelter, well, he's not that little, freaks, they think, "Oh, the world
[02:43:09.804 --> 02:43:16.125]   is evil. The world is terrible. It's nihilism. And it's these people, these happy people,
[02:43:16.125 --> 02:43:19.855]  these builders, it's their fault. I've got to take them out.
[02:43:19.855 --> 02:43:23.205]   I've got to..." And you can see it on their faces. They're all disgusted.
[02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:28.044]  I love how the former CIA director, Hayden, said, we're nihilistic and dangerous.
[02:43:28.104 --> 02:43:28.885]  They're the nihilists.
[02:43:28.905 --> 02:43:39.353]  We're trying to save civilization, but because we're not afraid of them and are willing to die, they call us the most dangerous political force in the world is Republicans, because we have a populist beachhead.
[02:43:39.373 --> 02:43:45.358]  This is the CIA admitting the Republican Christians are the number one enemy, because we are the enemy of you.
[02:43:45.478 --> 02:43:46.279]  You're the nihilist.
[02:43:46.559 --> 02:43:47.400]  You're the satanist.
[02:43:47.660 --> 02:43:48.861]  You're the nuclear war lovers.
[02:43:48.921 --> 02:43:50.022]  You're the threat, not us.
[02:43:50.322 --> 02:43:55.507]  He doesn't even consider the irony that saying that you can't be nihilistic and Christian at the same time.
[02:43:55.547 --> 02:43:57.889]  So they're all Christian nationalists and they're also nihilistic.
[02:43:57.929 --> 02:43:58.469]  Which one is it?
[02:43:58.489 --> 02:44:00.591]  Because those are two vastly separate things.
[02:44:00.671 --> 02:44:01.712]  He means we're not afraid.
[02:44:02.013 --> 02:44:02.333]  Correct.
[02:44:02.433 --> 02:44:03.614]  He means we can't be intimidated.
[02:44:03.754 --> 02:44:04.054]  Correct.
[02:44:04.375 --> 02:44:05.335]  Because a Christian...
[02:44:06.036 --> 02:44:19.020]  A Christian who is someone who has God at the center of their heart, a Christian who knows that Jesus is still on the throne, that Christ is king of the universe, will not be swayed by these petty arguments.
[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:20.201]  And God says, don't have fear, son.
[02:44:20.721 --> 02:44:23.482]  Stand up for the children, no matter what happens, you're eternal.
[02:44:23.522 --> 02:44:24.502]  What's the last commandment?
[02:44:24.802 --> 02:44:26.063]  Thou shalt not covet.
[02:44:26.983 --> 02:44:30.404]  And that commandment stands in the way of all communism.
[02:44:31.165 --> 02:44:35.066]  That commandment stands in the way of everything, because that's what they want.
[02:44:35.086 --> 02:44:35.807]  They are covetous.
[02:44:36.287 --> 02:44:37.827]  They want to steal.
[02:44:38.167 --> 02:44:39.508]  They want to take.
[02:44:39.868 --> 02:44:41.549]  They want to destroy.
[02:44:41.869 --> 02:44:43.630]  They want to tear down.
[02:44:43.710 --> 02:44:44.810]  They're not builders.
[02:44:45.230 --> 02:44:46.651]  They've never built anything.
[02:44:46.931 --> 02:44:48.271]  They've never created anything.
[02:44:48.290 --> 02:44:51.790]  They hate people who run and build things.
[02:44:51.790 --> 02:44:55.110]  Why they hate women, because what do they target?
[02:44:55.110 --> 02:44:57.709]  Womanhood's most sacred act.
[02:44:57.709 --> 02:45:01.370]  There's nothing more fabulous than a woman can grow a baby.
[02:45:01.370 --> 02:45:05.270]   They're magic, they're holy, and they're attacking because they hate it.
[02:45:05.270 --> 02:45:10.190]   The most ancient institution that we have records for, through the archaeological record
[02:45:10.190 --> 02:45:12.390]  and evidence, is the nuclear family.
[02:45:12.656 --> 02:45:14.358]  Man, woman, children.
[02:45:14.578 --> 02:45:16.039]  Man, woman, children.
[02:45:16.079 --> 02:45:20.303]  And we've got bones from hundreds of thousands of years ago, and that's what we find in the caves.
[02:45:20.563 --> 02:45:22.926]  It's man, woman... And it's not politics, it's what we are.
[02:45:23.106 --> 02:45:24.547]  It's what we are.
[02:45:24.827 --> 02:45:29.832]  And that is a threat to them, because that is what they are against, because they are against humanity itself.
[02:45:29.872 --> 02:45:34.155]  Because they want to be God, and men and women together aren't God, but it's God's work.
[02:45:34.535 --> 02:45:35.315]  It's God's ritual.
[02:45:35.596 --> 02:45:40.219]  They can't compete against the purity and the ecstasy and the supremacy of the family.
[02:45:40.559 --> 02:45:40.719]  No.
[02:45:41.179 --> 02:45:44.501]  So to disrupt, to understand, they say, well, we want the new family.
[02:45:44.541 --> 02:45:45.542]  We want the new normal.
[02:45:45.762 --> 02:45:47.003]  We want the modern family.
[02:45:47.203 --> 02:45:54.488]  What they're doing is trying to overturn the very center core of what makes us human.
[02:45:54.808 --> 02:45:59.892]  The woman that is able to produce children is removed.
[02:46:00.112 --> 02:46:05.036]  The father that protects the family and leads them and guides them is also removed.
[02:46:05.396 --> 02:46:06.358]  Which is the ultimate team.
[02:46:06.698 --> 02:46:08.661]  I'll do five more minutes, you take over and host.
[02:46:09.142 --> 02:46:12.908]  Get the book Unhumans Now Everywhere by Jack Posobiec.
[02:46:13.229 --> 02:46:16.094]  And we need your support too at drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:46:17.188 --> 02:46:19.489]  I don't know what I'd do if I saw Fauci walking down the street or Bill Gates.
[02:46:19.569 --> 02:46:22.290]  I mean, he's so outrageously evil.
[02:46:22.730 --> 02:46:24.191]  He's such a murderer!
[02:46:24.671 --> 02:46:30.293]  And we need to have... You're a Christian, you're a father, you're a theologian, you're able to be really calm and nice about this.
[02:46:30.333 --> 02:46:33.754]  I know you're pissed off about it, but... The thing is, take action, folks.
[02:46:33.814 --> 02:46:34.474]  Resist them.
[02:46:34.795 --> 02:46:35.955]  Protect yourself from them.
[02:46:36.075 --> 02:46:36.815]  Expose them.
[02:46:37.636 --> 02:46:40.957]  What do we do biblically, do you think, to just spiritually be able to deal with this?
[02:46:42.025 --> 02:46:46.269]  Well, we can't deal with stuff like this on our own.
[02:46:46.769 --> 02:46:48.111]  You have to lean on God.
[02:46:48.851 --> 02:46:49.392]  You have to.
[02:46:49.432 --> 02:46:53.656]  Because when you look at what He is, He knows the beginning from the end.
[02:46:53.696 --> 02:46:55.637]  He knows everything that we're going through.
[02:46:56.238 --> 02:46:59.061]  In the midst of the storm, He brings peace.
[02:46:59.741 --> 02:47:02.424]  We know how this game ends.
[02:47:03.064 --> 02:47:04.305]  And we know who wins.
[02:47:05.166 --> 02:47:05.366]  Right?
[02:47:05.466 --> 02:47:07.907]  And the Bible tells us every knee must bow.
[02:47:08.248 --> 02:47:11.829]  The knee of sickness, the knee of disease, the knee of all these things that we're seeing.
[02:47:12.329 --> 02:47:14.651]  And we know what happens to the devil.
[02:47:15.071 --> 02:47:16.732]  Jesus throws him in the pit.
[02:47:17.452 --> 02:47:17.712]  Right?
[02:47:17.872 --> 02:47:20.113]  And so we know who wins this.
[02:47:20.213 --> 02:47:21.174]  But here's the thing.
[02:47:22.094 --> 02:47:25.196]  God never told us that this life was going to be easy.
[02:47:25.856 --> 02:47:26.717]  He never told us.
[02:47:26.837 --> 02:47:28.498]  In fact, He told us the opposite.
[02:47:29.118 --> 02:47:32.320]  He said, Jesus said, you know, take up your cross and follow me.
[02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:36.082]  People are going to oppose you for following me.
[02:47:36.583 --> 02:47:37.183]  But you know what?
[02:47:37.343 --> 02:47:42.246]  The end result is going to be better if you follow me than if you don't.
[02:47:42.726 --> 02:48:01.487]   Right, so look at the opposition, take the opposition, but never deviate from that path of following truth and following victory and that strength of God who created the universe, who put All of his creativity in us because we were created in his image.
[02:48:01.867 --> 02:48:26.146]   We have to realize we've got that power of God Pulsating through our veins every single day because we're created in his image and when we do that We can have confidence that like what Psalms tells us and we can rest under the shadow of his wings That the enemy will come near our tent, but they can't come into it Look at the enemy, they're all slaves. Satan always
[02:48:26.146 --> 02:48:26.666]  destroys them.
[02:48:26.666 --> 02:48:29.666]   Even before they die, we see them betrayed, we see them destroyed.
[02:48:29.666 --> 02:48:34.666]   And we see billions and billions of dollars spent by the federal government secretly,
[02:48:34.666 --> 02:48:38.666]  with just Walgreens and CBS alone, to not prescribe ivermectin.
[02:48:39.313 --> 02:48:44.035]  So all this evil, you wonder why are they not giving people the drugs that they now admit works?
[02:48:44.395 --> 02:48:52.178]  Because they wanted to hurt people, they wanted people fearful, but it took billions to buy them off to do the evil, and the devil has the control of the purse.
[02:48:53.038 --> 02:48:54.962]  He has the power of the earth right now.
[02:48:55.002 --> 02:48:56.405]  He's the god of this world right now.
[02:48:56.646 --> 02:49:03.840]  But it shows every bit of it is mercenaries working against their own self-interest for a little bit of money.
[02:49:05.316 --> 02:49:06.578]  Our firm is just different.
[02:49:06.998 --> 02:49:10.963]  We charge 8% when you purchase, 0% when you liquidate.
[02:49:11.303 --> 02:49:17.290]  We buy directly from the depository in Shiner, Texas, the Texas Precious Metals Depository.
[02:49:17.730 --> 02:49:22.196]  So their wholesale prices, you tack on 8%, they ship it directly to you.
[02:49:22.636 --> 02:49:28.637]   When you sell it back, We take nothing, zero, and whatever the depository prices
[02:49:28.637 --> 02:49:30.076]  are, you get all of it.
[02:49:30.076 --> 02:49:37.358]   See, that's a huge difference from buying a rare coin, something that has a high commission,
[02:49:37.358 --> 02:49:41.996]   high premium, where even after the big move in silver that we've seen,
[02:49:41.996 --> 02:49:43.836]  you still haven't even broken even.

[02:50:33.437 --> 02:50:34.898]  That is such a victory for all of us.
[02:50:34.938 --> 02:50:37.599]  CNN had three million views, this guy had twelve and a half million views.
[02:50:37.699 --> 02:50:42.103]  By the way, Alex, and I'll tell you, too, that, you know, what's my plan for after this?
[02:50:42.143 --> 02:50:44.344]  The reason that I'm doing a flight right after this?
[02:50:44.585 --> 02:50:46.206]  Because I want to see my kids this weekend.
[02:50:46.566 --> 02:50:47.407]  That's the only thing we got.
[02:50:47.747 --> 02:50:48.668]  I got plans with my kids.
[02:50:48.688 --> 02:50:49.709]  We're going to take some time.
[02:50:50.609 --> 02:50:52.411]  If the weather's good, we're going to get out.
[02:50:52.611 --> 02:50:54.012]  We're going to go to the pool.
[02:50:54.092 --> 02:50:55.914]  You've got to spend time with your family.
[02:50:56.154 --> 02:50:57.835]  You have to absolutely do that.
[02:50:57.855 --> 02:50:59.316]  So, yeah, we're humping the book.
[02:50:59.336 --> 02:51:00.237]  We're getting it out there.
[02:51:00.537 --> 02:51:01.838]  But I want to see my kids.
[02:51:02.619 --> 02:51:06.461]  You know the Godfather where he says to his son, he goes, are you spending time with your family?
[02:51:06.481 --> 02:51:06.921]  Yeah.
[02:51:06.941 --> 02:51:09.283]  There's a man that doesn't spend time with his family, he's not a man.
[02:51:09.303 --> 02:51:09.803]  That's right.
[02:51:10.383 --> 02:51:11.904]  That's right.
[02:51:11.944 --> 02:51:27.953]  People don't know, by the way, so, you know, and I'll say this again, that many moons ago, when I was just getting started in all of this, that I remember I used to come on with Alex in 2016 is when we started doing it, met you at the RNC in Cleveland, we did the rally by the river.
[02:51:28.093 --> 02:51:28.213]  Yeah.
[02:51:29.594 --> 02:51:33.556]  With Roger, and everyone's there, and Diamond and Silk were there, that was great.
[02:51:34.196 --> 02:51:39.258]  And back then, even before I was at One America, I used to host Hour Four.
[02:51:39.278 --> 02:51:40.238]  You remember that?
[02:51:40.418 --> 02:51:40.618]  Yeah.
[02:51:41.099 --> 02:51:43.359]  And you'd be like, I didn't even know you back then!
[02:51:43.499 --> 02:51:46.481]  And I was just some guy, and you were like, hey, your microphone's not good.
[02:51:46.501 --> 02:52:00.086]   So guys, Alex Jones sends me my first microphone that I've got set up in just like a spare bedroom in the house, and I'm doing it over my laptop, and he goes, Oh yeah, I need someone to host Hour 4.
[02:52:00.346 --> 02:52:01.907]  Get in there, just do it.
[02:52:01.927 --> 02:52:02.768]  What do you want me to talk about?
[02:52:02.948 --> 02:52:04.209]  Whatever you like, I gotta go.
[02:52:04.569 --> 02:52:07.550]  And I'm like, I'm just some guy at that point.
[02:52:08.231 --> 02:52:10.292]  I had been through 2016, we had met, etc, etc.
[02:52:10.352 --> 02:52:11.633]  No, but you were a smart guy.
[02:52:11.973 --> 02:52:18.176]  But my point though is that people don't realize how much Alex does behind the scenes to help people.
[02:52:18.456 --> 02:52:25.320]  People don't realize how much that Alex is just generous with his time, generous with his resources.
[02:52:25.640 --> 02:52:26.340]  And that's a sigh.
[02:52:26.661 --> 02:52:29.122]  And by the way, spends time with your family.
[02:52:29.822 --> 02:52:37.006]  And you know, something that I've always tried to say is like, there's this this media caricature of Alex Jones.
[02:52:37.167 --> 02:52:40.368]  And I'm like, that's not the guy that I've ever met.
[02:52:40.488 --> 02:52:41.489]  I've never met him.
[02:52:41.589 --> 02:52:42.910]  I've spent plenty of time with him.
[02:52:43.270 --> 02:52:44.711]  I've never met this guy.
[02:52:45.151 --> 02:52:46.351]  He sounds crazy.
[02:52:46.391 --> 02:52:50.513]  I don't know that I'd want to meet the guy that they take you out to be, because that's just not you.
[02:52:50.613 --> 02:52:57.455]  And so, I mean, I just want to take the opportunity real quick to just say thank you for all the help that you gave me when I was getting started.
[02:52:57.515 --> 02:53:03.237]  Well, thank you, Jack, but it wasn't because you were like, I was just, you know, you were a talented, smart guy and we're making great points.
[02:53:03.277 --> 02:53:05.617]  I'm like, well, hey, you need to get on air and you need to do more.
[02:53:05.997 --> 02:53:06.718]  We're going to go to break.
[02:53:06.738 --> 02:53:07.538]  He's going to take over.
[02:53:07.558 --> 02:53:09.419]  I haven't plugged in three hours.
[02:53:09.519 --> 02:53:10.559]  If we don't do that, we'll be gone.
[02:53:11.159 --> 02:53:16.920]  InfoWarsTore.com, big sale, Vitamineral Fusion back in stock, X2 back in stock.
[02:53:17.121 --> 02:53:19.061]  There's a good chance InfoWars will continue.
[02:53:19.141 --> 02:53:21.062]  It's a battle every day, so pray for us.
[02:53:21.142 --> 02:53:24.382]  InfoWarsTore.com, drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:53:24.422 --> 02:53:26.443]  My dad, two years ago, said they're going to shut you down.
[02:53:26.823 --> 02:53:28.603]  He already developed the supplements.
[02:53:28.903 --> 02:53:30.604]  He went and set up a warehouse in North Austin.
[02:53:30.924 --> 02:53:32.044]  He's there and he was right.
[02:53:32.524 --> 02:53:34.125]  So, great products there.
[02:53:34.185 --> 02:53:37.923]   We've got the Next level foundational energy.
[02:53:38.544 --> 02:53:42.367]  We've got the 10-hour clean energy turbo force and all the nano silver products.
[02:53:42.928 --> 02:53:45.931]  We've got the rocket rest sleep and so amazing.
[02:53:45.971 --> 02:53:48.714]  We've got the top brain incredible nootropic.
[02:53:49.194 --> 02:53:54.339]  Check it all out the nano silver products everything at drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:53:54.359 --> 02:53:55.020]  But let me tell you Jack.
[02:53:55.080 --> 02:53:57.883]  Alex when you're when you're working hard you got a bunch of back-to-back flights.
[02:53:57.923 --> 02:53:58.944]  What's what's what's good?
[02:53:58.964 --> 02:53:59.965]  What should I what should I go for?
[02:54:01.345 --> 02:54:04.006]  Well, these supplements are all so strong, I barely take them.
[02:54:04.466 --> 02:54:06.067]  But they all really work well.
[02:54:06.247 --> 02:54:07.387]  I mean, I take them all.
[02:54:08.127 --> 02:54:09.388]  I haven't taken any today.
[02:54:09.448 --> 02:54:11.108]  I should have, because I was up until 2 a.m.
[02:54:11.148 --> 02:54:11.649]  last night.
[02:54:12.449 --> 02:54:13.689]  But they're all excellent.
[02:54:13.709 --> 02:54:14.570]  They're all just clones.
[02:54:14.590 --> 02:54:15.670]  I've already messed something up.
[02:54:15.850 --> 02:54:18.011]  I want to get some before I get back on that plane.
[02:54:18.031 --> 02:54:18.671]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:54:19.211 --> 02:54:21.092]  Okay, well, I'm going to tell you right now if you want.
[02:54:21.152 --> 02:54:23.313]  I'm going to tell you what you want right now.
[02:54:23.493 --> 02:54:23.713]  Yeah?
[02:54:24.113 --> 02:54:27.374]  You want, well, nitric boost gives you a lot of stuff.
[02:54:28.604 --> 02:54:30.310]  You want... No, that's rocket rash.
[02:54:30.350 --> 02:54:30.972]  You need to sleep.
[02:54:31.072 --> 02:54:31.735]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:54:32.136 --> 02:54:33.079]  Well, I will take that later tonight.
[02:54:33.099 --> 02:54:33.701]  You want...
[02:54:35.071 --> 02:54:36.412]  Next level foundational energy.
[02:54:36.873 --> 02:54:37.233]  There it is.
[02:54:37.253 --> 02:54:37.694]  Let me see.
[02:54:37.734 --> 02:54:39.035]  And there's no speed in that.
[02:54:39.315 --> 02:54:40.777]  It's a methyl folate to break down.
[02:54:40.857 --> 02:54:41.477]  Oh, wow.
[02:54:42.138 --> 02:54:42.599]  Oh, yeah.
[02:54:42.699 --> 02:54:45.802]  It's methyl folate to break down of what's in spinach.
[02:54:45.962 --> 02:54:47.223]  There's a lot in here, too.
[02:54:47.243 --> 02:54:47.984]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:54:48.104 --> 02:54:48.885]  There's a ton in here.
[02:54:48.945 --> 02:54:50.166]  The point is, it's a great product.
[02:54:50.546 --> 02:54:54.110]  This isn't one of the ones where they, you know, put the cotton in on the top so you only get a little bit.
[02:54:54.150 --> 02:54:54.931]  This is full.
[02:54:54.971 --> 02:54:55.892]  You're nice to support us.
[02:54:56.312 --> 02:54:56.552]  All right.
[02:54:56.612 --> 02:54:58.594]  Jack Mazzobbi takes over in one minute.
[02:54:58.413 --> 02:54:59.413]  it. Stay with us.
[02:54:59.413 --> 02:55:28.413]  [Music]
[02:55:28.413 --> 02:55:49.413]  [Music]
[02:55:49.413 --> 02:55:56.413]   While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:55:56.413 --> 02:56:01.153]  (music)
[02:56:01.009 --> 02:56:08.449]   Making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've
[02:56:08.449 --> 02:56:18.048]   been able to do with the COVID, excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do
[02:56:18.048 --> 02:56:22.769]  with, look, if we finally beat Medicare.
[02:56:23.173 --> 02:56:26.476]  We're trying to find housing for black Americans.
[02:56:26.576 --> 02:56:35.762]  The impact on the choice, the idea that they're gonna, I'm not, I've been proposing that.
[02:56:36.462 --> 02:56:40.885]  Everybody, they pay, the millionaires pay 1%, 1%.
[02:56:41.606 --> 02:56:46.289]  So no one after, I've not raised the cost of social security for anybody.
[02:56:46.409 --> 02:56:50.532]  I got my handicap when I was vice president down to a six.
[02:56:51.492 --> 02:57:04.618]  And wants to get rid of the ability of Medicare, for the ability for us to be able to negotiate drug prices with the big pharma companies.
[02:57:05.018 --> 02:57:06.679]  What I'm going to do is fix the tax system.
[02:57:06.699 --> 02:57:10.480]  For example, we had a thousand trillionaires in America.
[02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:12.161]  I mean billionaires in America.
[02:57:12.201 --> 02:57:13.442]  No one was hurt.
[02:57:13.502 --> 02:57:15.643]  No one Israeli was accidentally killed.
[02:57:16.223 --> 02:57:17.584]  And it just stopped.
[02:57:17.944 --> 02:57:20.445]  And I'm going to continue to move until we get to total ban.
[02:57:20.904 --> 02:57:27.904]   on the total initiative relative to what we're gonna do with more Border Patrol and more
[02:57:27.904 --> 02:57:32.904]  asylum officers.
[02:57:32.904 --> 02:57:40.824]   Coming to you from a command bunker in an undisclosed location deep within the heart
[02:57:40.824 --> 02:57:47.344]   of the Patriot readout of Texas, Jack Posobiec has taken over InfoWars.
[02:57:47.645 --> 02:57:52.727]  Finally, Poso has come back to the revolution.
[02:57:52.847 --> 02:57:55.307]   This is The Resistance.
[02:57:55.307 --> 02:57:59.747]   If you are listening to this transmission, you are The Resistance.
[02:57:59.747 --> 02:58:01.747]  This is the nerve center.
[02:58:01.747 --> 02:58:04.586]  Look, we've got the great book, Unhumans.
[02:58:04.586 --> 02:58:06.086]  It's coming out right now.
[02:58:06.086 --> 02:58:11.567]   You guys need to get your copy of this because this will be your playbook.
[02:58:11.567 --> 02:58:18.067]   It will be your system guide, and it will be your map through what comes next.
[02:58:18.337 --> 02:58:23.560]  What is coming next, what the United States is entering into, is a very chaotic era.
[02:58:23.880 --> 02:58:31.965]  Now these eras have taken place throughout time, throughout different distances, throughout different places, throughout different parts of our world.
[02:58:32.665 --> 02:58:35.286]  And yet they all follow similar patterns.
[02:58:35.526 --> 02:58:37.807]  They all follow a similar playbook.
[02:58:38.007 --> 02:58:39.348]  We've got the playbook.
[02:58:39.668 --> 02:58:40.728]  This is the playbook.
[02:58:41.108 --> 02:58:51.152]  You've got to get your copy because it will show you how you can guide your family, how you can guide yourself, guide your business through the tumult that is coming.
[02:58:51.392 --> 02:58:52.913]  We promised you you would see this.
[02:58:53.860 --> 02:59:03.264]  We promised you that when we entered the fourth turning, that we are currently in, that you would face these things immediately.
[02:59:03.645 --> 02:59:17.970]   And now that it is happening, now that it is here, it is, and by the way, unquestionably begun as of last night, when the kill switch was flipped, when you saw, look, I predicted going into this, that we would see the intelligence
[02:59:17.970 --> 02:59:20.710]  operation run against the debate.
[02:59:20.710 --> 02:59:22.269]  I said there's going to be an intel operation.
[02:59:22.269 --> 02:59:26.649]   It was all Steve Bannon yesterday at the War Room doing his show down in Washington, DC.
[02:59:26.649 --> 02:59:30.189]   And I said, there's going to be an intelligence operation at the debate.
[02:59:30.189 --> 02:59:31.189]  Why?
[02:59:31.189 --> 02:59:33.648]  Because that's exactly what we saw in 2016.
[02:59:33.648 --> 02:59:35.430]  That's exactly what we saw in 2020.
[02:59:35.430 --> 02:59:40.190]   You saw the intel operation of the Steele dossier that Hillary launched with Jake Sullivan.
[02:59:40.190 --> 02:59:46.590]   You then saw, and by the way, Gary Gensler, who's the SEC chairman now today, was the
[02:59:46.590 --> 02:59:56.229]   CFO of Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016 that signed off on the payments for the dossier.
[02:59:56.293 --> 03:00:10.615]  By the way, don't seem to recall Hillary and Gary Gensler being arrested for this, for these illegal campaign donations, the way that Trump was, where he's now facing conviction and sentencing on July 18th.
[03:00:10.895 --> 03:00:21.257]  The next operation, of course, as we now know, was the Hunter Biden laptop response letter, the CIA-driven letter.
[03:00:22.332 --> 03:00:46.486]  That came out just before the debate, that was immediately done and designed to blunt the impact of Hunter Biden's laptop, which confirmed everything that we knew about charisma, that we knew about Ukraine, that we knew about the Bidens being up to their ears in corruption with Ukrainian and Chinese oligarchs from the Chinese Communist Party.
[03:00:48.339 --> 03:00:50.400]  They knew it was coming out by the first debate.
[03:00:50.680 --> 03:00:53.902]  The FBI already had it at the time of the first debate.
[03:00:54.582 --> 03:00:58.204]  It wasn't public yet at the time of the first debate, but the Deep State knew it was there.
[03:00:58.524 --> 03:01:00.965]  The Deep State knew that it was coming, and it was them.
[03:01:01.306 --> 03:01:21.987]   And Mike Morrell, the former CIA director, testified under oath in the House that James Clapper Was the coach behind the entire thing, putting together the 51, Jeremy Bash, former husband of Dana Bash, excuse me, Dana Bash, gotta say Dana Bash, Dana Bash, from CNN.
[03:01:23.527 --> 03:01:24.428]  Was one of the signers.
[03:01:25.248 --> 03:01:28.370]  But who was the quarterback of that operation?
[03:01:28.490 --> 03:01:29.931]  Who kicked it all into motion?
[03:01:30.251 --> 03:01:40.617]  Well, it was none other than Biden's senior foreign policy advisor for his campaign at the time, a man by the name of Tony Blinken, who is now the Secretary of State.
[03:01:40.877 --> 03:01:44.640]  So understand, the head of the SEC, the Secretary of the State.
[03:01:45.680 --> 03:02:00.647]  The National Security Advisor, all currently serving in the Biden regime, were all intrinsically tied as FBI and CIA assets who interfered in our elections through the vehicle of the debates.
[03:02:01.087 --> 03:02:05.329]  But what I didn't know, and I didn't realize this until the debate started.
[03:02:07.008 --> 03:02:09.290]  Was this time the target of the operation wasn't Trump.
[03:02:10.110 --> 03:02:14.033]  This time the target of the operation was Joe Biden.
[03:02:14.253 --> 03:02:26.643]  And go look at Kamala Harris because I've just seen some pictures right now that she all of a sudden has a whole profile that they're rolling out in Rolling Stone magazine.
[03:02:26.983 --> 03:02:30.625]  That Rolling Stone magazine is doing a whole spread on Kamala Harris.
[03:02:30.845 --> 03:02:33.206]  And look at her, she's wearing her virginal white.
[03:02:33.666 --> 03:02:36.468]  Ah yes, virginal white Kamala Harris.
[03:02:36.788 --> 03:02:39.929]  She didn't even wait 24 hours.
[03:02:40.249 --> 03:02:47.293]  Kamala, the body is still warm and you're already out there dancing on the grave of your predecessor.
[03:02:47.853 --> 03:02:49.314]  Because that's all she knows, folks.
[03:02:49.774 --> 03:02:50.414]  All she knows.
[03:02:50.634 --> 03:02:53.375]  There's no honor among un-humans.
[03:02:53.696 --> 03:02:56.877]  There's no honor among un-humans.
[03:02:57.157 --> 03:02:58.598]  The kill switch was flipped.
[03:02:59.438 --> 03:03:02.279]  Team Obama started throwing Biden under the bus.
[03:03:02.620 --> 03:03:10.863]  All of a sudden, CNN, MSNBC, all of the cast of characters that you know, and we're going to put together this montage, by the way.
[03:03:10.923 --> 03:03:12.104]  Alex was chatting about it earlier.
[03:03:12.904 --> 03:03:22.092]  Where the same people who were worshipping, genuflecting at his feet in recent weeks, all of a sudden are singing a different tune.
[03:03:23.013 --> 03:03:32.641]  And I submit to you, and this montage when we put it together will reveal it to you and show it to you, that the words coming out of their mouths are not their own.
[03:03:33.102 --> 03:03:34.843]  Their ideas are not their own.
[03:03:35.524 --> 03:03:38.787]  They are bought and sold and controlled.
[03:03:40.796 --> 03:03:45.237]  By the people behind the scenes, by the oligarchs, by the national security agencies.
[03:03:45.597 --> 03:03:52.699]  Those are the ones who decided to take Biden out because Biden wouldn't go out on his own.
[03:03:53.119 --> 03:03:54.699]  They were trying to get him not run.
[03:03:55.379 --> 03:03:56.840]  They were trying to get him out of there.
[03:03:57.180 --> 03:04:05.081]  They set him up with this early debate months before the convention because now they need to ratchet the pressure up on Biden.
[03:04:05.721 --> 03:04:13.566]   The danger, ladies and gentlemen, The danger is these unhumans are willing to sacrifice our country.
[03:04:13.927 --> 03:04:26.096]  They're willing to sacrifice our world through World War III to maintain their power, to maintain their pressure grip, their demonic grip on our society.
[03:04:27.102 --> 03:04:29.363]  So the question is, are you going to be ready?
[03:04:29.883 --> 03:04:33.125]  Are you going to be prepared when all of that comes?
[03:04:33.365 --> 03:04:36.767]  Because that's what we're entering into in this next phase.
[03:04:37.087 --> 03:04:41.489]  By the way, President Trump is expected to speak very soon here in Virginia.
[03:04:41.749 --> 03:04:42.770]  We're monitoring that.
[03:04:42.810 --> 03:04:44.251]  The team is monitoring that here.
[03:04:44.611 --> 03:04:48.273]  Stay tuned because we've got a great hour lined up for you.
[03:04:48.313 --> 03:04:54.016]  We're going to be walking through all of this and so much more here on InfoWars Hour 4.
[03:04:56.144 --> 03:04:57.125]  Okay, we're skipping that break.
[03:04:57.145 --> 03:05:03.170]  I want to go here to understanding what pieces are currently in play.
[03:05:03.470 --> 03:05:09.095]  This Supreme Court decision, which is something that Alex and I, I wanted to talk about this a little bit more when it was coming out.
[03:05:09.636 --> 03:05:17.183]  I wanted to give a little more explanation and President Trump we see, so he's there and I'm monitoring and I've got a second monitor over here.
[03:05:17.543 --> 03:05:23.982]   So he is expected to speak momentarily that And there down there you can see people.
[03:05:24.023 --> 03:05:25.083]  It's an outdoor rally.
[03:05:25.124 --> 03:05:25.564]  It's hot.
[03:05:25.664 --> 03:05:26.465]  It's Chesapeake.
[03:05:26.545 --> 03:05:28.627]  It's down in the Newport area there.
[03:05:28.647 --> 03:05:31.449]  The Hampton Roads area of Virginia.
[03:05:32.520 --> 03:05:35.162]  I spent a lot of time there in the military myself when I was in the Navy.
[03:05:35.242 --> 03:05:37.143]  Huge naval concentration area.
[03:05:37.163 --> 03:05:39.104]  A lot of military families.
[03:05:39.124 --> 03:05:41.345]  That's one of the huge red parts of the state.
[03:05:41.586 --> 03:05:46.829]  And those are the parts of the state that President Trump knows that he's got to turn out if he does want to flip Virginia.
[03:05:46.869 --> 03:05:55.874]  Of course, Glenn Youngkin, who won as governor, was someone who won in what a lot of people saw as an upset, because Virginia had been going and trending blue since the Obama era.
[03:05:56.775 --> 03:06:10.353]   This case that came out from the Supreme Court, January 6th case, Section 1512 C2 of the US Code regarding obstruction.
[03:06:10.854 --> 03:06:12.454]  Obstruction of justice.
[03:06:13.094 --> 03:06:15.135]  What was the obstruction of justice?
[03:06:15.635 --> 03:06:19.017]  Well, obstructing a government proceeding.
[03:06:19.937 --> 03:06:33.262]  The problem was, was that all of the J6ers, so many of the J6ers, up to and including, by the way, President Trump himself, were charged with obstruction of a proceeding.
[03:06:34.465 --> 03:06:35.205]  But here's the issue.
[03:06:36.045 --> 03:06:40.486]  That was written in a statute, and this gets deep into the legalities.
[03:06:41.787 --> 03:06:46.128]  That statute, that law, was only written for criminal proceedings.
[03:06:46.988 --> 03:07:04.770]   And so these people, Weisman, Merrick Garland, Matt Graves, the people, the scum, Who didn't care how many J6ers were shooting and killing themselves or hanging themselves because of the charges that kept being brought against them.
[03:07:05.050 --> 03:07:10.431]  Remember, the unhuman does not view a patriot death as a problem.
[03:07:10.691 --> 03:07:14.292]  The unhuman views a patriot death as the goal.
[03:07:14.752 --> 03:07:18.693]  Why do people still support communism after it's killed 100 million people?
[03:07:19.273 --> 03:07:22.495]  Because to them, 100 million people is a good start.
[03:07:22.916 --> 03:07:30.180]  That's 100 million people paving the road of skulls and blood and bodies to utopia.
[03:07:30.240 --> 03:07:36.665]  Remember, folks, remember, boys and girls, communism is only one genocide away from full utopia.
[03:07:36.945 --> 03:07:41.668]  Communism is only one mass killing away from getting it exactly right.
[03:07:41.728 --> 03:07:44.850]  And then later, you just claim that that wasn't real communism.
[03:07:45.070 --> 03:07:48.673]  See, this is how it works again and again and again throughout history.
[03:07:49.613 --> 03:08:06.166]  So for the un-humans here, the J6 operation was always about rounding up, naming patriots, identifying patriots, using that cell phone data that they were able to find from the Stingrays and the other various devices that the Secret Service...
[03:08:07.133 --> 03:08:09.734]  The Department of Homeland Security and others had set up that day.
[03:08:09.834 --> 03:08:10.235]  I was there.
[03:08:10.855 --> 03:08:13.536]  I was there reporting at the time.
[03:08:13.997 --> 03:08:15.618]  I saw what was happening at the Ellipse.
[03:08:15.958 --> 03:08:16.538]  I went up.
[03:08:16.618 --> 03:08:21.861]  I was watching the speech at the war room, come down, and what did I see?
[03:08:23.183 --> 03:08:28.568]  I saw the start, and we talk about this in the book, of an inverse Bastille event.
[03:08:29.169 --> 03:08:39.199]  We call it an inverse Bastille because the Bastille, during the French Revolution, was the targeting and the attempted liberation of political prisoners by the revolutionaries.
[03:08:39.660 --> 03:08:43.603]  This time, it was a revolution done on patriots themselves.
[03:08:43.984 --> 03:08:47.022]   The revolution Was done by the government.
[03:08:47.783 --> 03:08:54.169]  The government entrapped patriots, bringing them into January 6th, bringing them into that cauldron.
[03:08:54.429 --> 03:08:57.051]  And Alex told you the story, he's told you the story a million times.
[03:08:57.632 --> 03:09:04.178]  That he was planning to hold a separate rally on the steps of the Supreme Court in that area.
[03:09:04.559 --> 03:09:10.624]  It was a First Amendment permitted rally, had totally been set up, it had totally been prepared for.
[03:09:11.385 --> 03:09:14.527]  And that was why they were marching up.
[03:09:14.887 --> 03:09:15.628]  That was the goal.
[03:09:15.668 --> 03:09:21.651]  But all of a sudden, the infiltrators start showing up and saying, don't go here to the rally.
[03:09:22.132 --> 03:09:25.574]  Come over this way and go and fight.
[03:09:26.294 --> 03:09:27.355]  Go into the Capitol.
[03:09:27.915 --> 03:09:29.116]  Overthrow your government.
[03:09:29.516 --> 03:09:30.477]  That's the enemy.
[03:09:30.817 --> 03:09:31.457]  That's in there.
[03:09:31.517 --> 03:09:35.240]  And it's very interesting to me because I saw a lot of those agitators with my own two eyes.
[03:09:36.380 --> 03:09:37.141]  And even before then.
[03:09:38.556 --> 03:09:41.058]  I'm coming down 101 Constitution Avenue.
[03:09:41.218 --> 03:09:41.839]  Story's in the book.
[03:09:44.080 --> 03:09:46.702]  I see the protesters and I see the marchers.
[03:09:47.523 --> 03:09:53.186]  And I'll tell you something, and I will always remember this, that was a peaceful crowd.
[03:09:53.947 --> 03:09:58.789]  It was a crowd that was just every bit as peaceful as the people you see at any other Trump rally.
[03:09:59.250 --> 03:10:04.132]  You see the Trump rallies from time and time and time again, everyone was peaceful.
[03:10:04.172 --> 03:10:06.174]  There's a Trump rally going on right now, and guess what?
[03:10:06.514 --> 03:10:12.477]  Everyone's standing around, they're being very orderly, they're being completely peaceful, even outside, even in the heat.
[03:10:12.517 --> 03:10:13.858]  January 6th wasn't hot, it was cold.
[03:10:15.640 --> 03:10:18.642]  And then all of a sudden I hear, boom, boom!
[03:10:20.784 --> 03:10:25.487]  Stun grenades, two flashbangs thrown into a peaceful crowd.
[03:10:26.688 --> 03:10:28.129]  That's when chaos broke out.
[03:10:28.950 --> 03:10:31.431]  That's when people started saying, what's going on?
[03:10:31.832 --> 03:10:33.593]  Why are you pushing against us?
[03:10:34.634 --> 03:10:38.616]  They didn't know that agitators had cut down the fencing.
[03:10:39.353 --> 03:10:43.272]   that agitators had removed barricades that were supposed to be on the lawn.
[03:10:43.272 --> 03:10:47.433]   And they certainly didn't know that President Trump had called for 10,000 National Guardsmen
[03:10:47.433 --> 03:10:50.474]  to be there. And President Trump brought this up last night.
[03:10:50.474 --> 03:10:57.233]   He did excellent in making sure that he got his narrative, the true narrative of January 6th
[03:10:57.233 --> 03:11:05.343]   out amongst Biden's lies about what happened that day. So I saw the stun grenades thrown
[03:11:05.343 --> 03:11:07.433]  at the peaceful crowd.
[03:11:08.258 --> 03:11:09.598]  That's what started the violence.
[03:11:10.159 --> 03:11:11.680]  Then came the OC spray.
[03:11:12.180 --> 03:11:13.461]  Then came the tear gas.
[03:11:14.261 --> 03:11:15.902]  Mass pandemonium breaks out.
[03:11:16.262 --> 03:11:18.864]  People have no idea what's going on.
[03:11:19.084 --> 03:11:22.386]  They can't understand why the Capitol Police are attacking them.
[03:11:22.666 --> 03:11:26.668]  They can't understand why the Capitol Police has incited this violence.
[03:11:27.629 --> 03:11:29.730]  And we know the rest of the story.
[03:11:30.610 --> 03:11:33.132]  They then use that to target President Trump.
[03:11:34.226 --> 03:11:36.047]  They used that to target Steve Bannon.
[03:11:36.548 --> 03:11:38.369]  They used that to target Peter Navarro.
[03:11:38.770 --> 03:11:42.112]  They used that to target the patriot leaders of America.
[03:11:42.793 --> 03:11:48.257]  Because the patriot leaders always stood in the way of their total domination.
[03:11:48.577 --> 03:11:52.720]  And so, believe it or not, believe it or not, that's what you're living through.
[03:11:53.601 --> 03:11:56.823]  And this is how I can predict what will happen next.
[03:11:57.224 --> 03:12:07.628]   This is how, by understanding the system, by understanding The playbook that's been run again and again in these countries, we can then predict what will happen next.
[03:12:07.988 --> 03:12:12.012]  So when I say, okay, we're at the phase where the Bolsheviks are throwing off the Mensheviks.
[03:12:12.032 --> 03:12:12.813]  The younger, more virulent.
[03:12:17.048 --> 03:12:22.232]  More ruthless, more brutal Bolsheviks are saying the Mensheviks aren't going hard enough.
[03:12:22.833 --> 03:12:25.155]  Biden is not revolutionary enough.
[03:12:25.555 --> 03:12:27.337]  We want to throw him off.
[03:12:27.717 --> 03:12:31.240]  We want someone even more angry, like Gretchen Whitmer.
[03:12:31.780 --> 03:12:34.002]  You remember what she did during the lockdowns?
[03:12:34.543 --> 03:12:41.989]  Josh Shapiro, this absolute snake from Pennsylvania, a guy I've known for a very long time, by the way, since he was a state rep.
[03:12:43.740 --> 03:12:45.160]  Gavin Newsom?
[03:12:45.901 --> 03:12:52.842]  Do you have any idea what Gavin Newsom would do with the power of the presidency, with the power of the DOJ behind him?
[03:12:52.862 --> 03:12:59.024]  A guy who's already sold out half of his state, if not more, to the Chinese Communists?
[03:12:59.264 --> 03:12:59.984]  No, there's no question.
[03:13:00.684 --> 03:13:01.424]  There's no question.
[03:13:02.925 --> 03:13:03.805]  You need to be ready.
[03:13:05.097 --> 03:13:07.518]  You need to be ready for the chaos that's happening.
[03:13:07.538 --> 03:13:08.738]  So Kamala Harris is out there.
[03:13:08.758 --> 03:13:14.920]  What's interesting to me, I will say this, what's very interesting to me is that they don't seem to have a settled plan just yet.
[03:13:14.980 --> 03:13:18.762]  Because Biden was supposed to say that he wasn't running.
[03:13:19.522 --> 03:13:24.284]  And I spent two years telling you that this was coming, that this was all bubbling up behind the scenes.
[03:13:26.184 --> 03:13:33.027]  Because in Washington DC, where unfortunately I live and work, and have for the last 12 years now, a dozen years, I can't believe that.
[03:13:34.031 --> 03:13:35.451]  Alex is trying to talk me into coming to Texas.
[03:13:35.491 --> 03:13:35.832]  We'll see.
[03:13:35.972 --> 03:13:36.292]  We'll see.
[03:13:36.632 --> 03:13:37.592]  See, I kinda like it down here.
[03:13:37.872 --> 03:13:38.813]  I gotta admit.
[03:13:40.593 --> 03:13:42.654]  But it's the biggest little town in the world.
[03:13:43.314 --> 03:14:01.640]  Because everybody knows everybody in Washington, D.C., and you get contacts, and if you're working as a good collector, if you're working as a good intelligence operative, then you're making contacts and you're building rapport with people who have sources and sub-sources, or who are sources, in places of information that you need.
[03:14:02.199 --> 03:14:04.879]  So I hear what's going on on the Democrat side all the time.
[03:14:05.240 --> 03:14:14.481]  I've heard constantly about the infighting between Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, and the fact there's no love lost between each other, that the Obamas don't particularly like the Bidens.
[03:14:14.501 --> 03:14:16.302]  Remember, Biden was never supposed to be president.
[03:14:16.582 --> 03:14:18.782]  Hillary Clinton was supposed to be president in this moment.
[03:14:19.402 --> 03:14:23.603]  But instead, Biden ends up there kind of by default because they didn't really have anyone else.
[03:14:24.583 --> 03:14:28.604]  And remember, they're the ones who screwed over people in the primary against him.
[03:14:30.962 --> 03:14:34.963]  Now the full court press has begun to get Biden out.
[03:14:35.443 --> 03:14:37.324]  Kamala Harris, she's in business for herself.
[03:14:37.784 --> 03:14:39.404]  She's totally in business for herself.
[03:14:39.684 --> 03:14:41.225]  She's not working with the Obamas.
[03:14:41.465 --> 03:14:42.965]  She's not working with the Clintons.
[03:14:43.205 --> 03:14:44.886]  She's in business for herself.
[03:14:44.946 --> 03:14:47.506]  If anyone, she's actually kind of working with the squad.
[03:14:47.826 --> 03:14:51.327]  That's probably her closest allies that are out there right now.
[03:14:51.567 --> 03:14:54.048]  But of course, they just lost one of their own in Jamal Bowman.
[03:14:54.528 --> 03:14:57.889]  So they're not as powerful as she needs, but she's got some allies in the media.
[03:14:57.909 --> 03:15:04.151]  So she's running around CNN looking presidential Kamala, Rolling Stone with the new puff pieces up.
[03:15:04.191 --> 03:15:12.993]  By the way, if you guys can find that, those pictures of Kamala Harris that came out with the virginal white, virginal white Kamala Harris running around with her pantsuit.
[03:15:13.333 --> 03:15:15.454]  And then who else is poking her head around again?
[03:15:15.713 --> 03:15:21.873]   Oh, here comes Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton with the new book, with the new book tour,
[03:15:21.873 --> 03:15:25.834]  the PR tour, she's going to make noise again.
[03:15:25.834 --> 03:15:30.313]  She's going to come around again and say, guys, remember me?
[03:15:30.313 --> 03:15:31.693]  I'm still here.
[03:15:31.693 --> 03:15:32.693]  I'm still eligible.
[03:15:32.693 --> 03:15:35.432]  Why don't you let old Hill Dog back in?
[03:15:35.432 --> 03:15:41.033]   And I will say this, that when you're in one of these scenarios, death of Stalin scenario,
[03:15:41.033 --> 03:15:47.273]   when you're in the Bolsheviks versus the Mensheviks, when you're in a power vacuum, like the power
[03:15:47.273 --> 03:15:49.593]  vacuum that ensued after the death of Lenin.
[03:15:50.536 --> 03:15:59.486]  It is the most brutal, it is the most ruthless, it is the most, but the person who has the most support, and through those methods, that's able to win.
[03:15:59.506 --> 03:16:02.449]  In the Soviet Union, that was Joseph Stalin.
[03:16:02.810 --> 03:16:04.071]  That's how he came to power.
[03:16:04.432 --> 03:16:08.076]  And he locked up every single other member.
[03:16:09.508 --> 03:16:10.609]  Every single other member.
[03:16:10.869 --> 03:16:14.452]  Oh yeah, of the Russian Communist Party.
[03:16:14.492 --> 03:16:15.212]  Here's Hillary now.
[03:16:15.873 --> 03:16:17.014]  I'll be voting for Biden.
[03:16:17.034 --> 03:16:17.794]  Of course you are.
[03:16:18.215 --> 03:16:18.975]  Of course you are.
[03:16:19.756 --> 03:16:20.977]  But she's giving her interviews.
[03:16:21.017 --> 03:16:22.038]  She's putting it out there.
[03:16:22.298 --> 03:16:23.138]  Gavin Newscombe.
[03:16:23.619 --> 03:16:25.000]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[03:16:25.180 --> 03:16:26.481]  I'm not running.
[03:16:26.701 --> 03:16:26.881]  No.
[03:16:27.262 --> 03:16:27.462]  Me?
[03:16:27.722 --> 03:16:28.282]  Of course not.
[03:16:28.423 --> 03:16:29.003]  No, no, no.
[03:16:29.563 --> 03:16:30.204]  I'm not gonna run.
[03:16:31.601 --> 03:16:32.482]  We know what you're doing.
[03:16:33.102 --> 03:16:35.443]  It's not really all that complicated.
[03:16:35.963 --> 03:16:39.005]  You want to run, you want to be the guy, you want to get in there.
[03:16:39.025 --> 03:16:41.346]  Kamala Harris suddenly does all these interviews.
[03:16:41.687 --> 03:16:43.167]  Hillary Clinton's in the news again.
[03:16:43.447 --> 03:16:43.848]  It's clear.
[03:16:44.308 --> 03:16:45.629]  It's clear and it's obvious.
[03:16:46.809 --> 03:16:50.451]  This is an open and unbridled Democrat civil war.
[03:16:50.812 --> 03:16:54.273]  The question is, how does the Obama, so you have to understand there's various factions.
[03:16:54.474 --> 03:16:58.676]  There's the Obama faction, there's the Clinton faction, the Kamala faction, and the Biden faction.
[03:16:59.724 --> 03:17:02.625]  Now the Biden faction, they have control of the DOJ.
[03:17:02.925 --> 03:17:04.185]  They have the control of the FBI.
[03:17:04.405 --> 03:17:05.966]  They have control of the military.
[03:17:06.286 --> 03:17:08.466]  They have the ability to influence NATO.
[03:17:09.006 --> 03:17:12.767]  This is a massive problem because it's a threat.
[03:17:13.067 --> 03:17:14.148]  This is a threat to you.
[03:17:14.428 --> 03:17:15.648]  This is a threat to our world.
[03:17:15.908 --> 03:17:21.689]  And now you've got Joe Biden even openly announcing, and we had the clip earlier, saying, we're going to lock him up.
[03:17:22.310 --> 03:17:23.150]  We're going to lock him up.
[03:17:23.230 --> 03:17:23.990]  There's time for that.
[03:17:24.230 --> 03:17:25.690]  We're going to lock him up.
[03:17:26.070 --> 03:17:26.911]  Oh, there's time for that.
[03:17:27.051 --> 03:17:27.791]  We're locking him up.
[03:17:29.107 --> 03:17:30.888]  Folks, you need to be ready.
[03:17:31.509 --> 03:17:33.110]  You need to be ready for what's happening.
[03:17:33.630 --> 03:17:39.515]  Ready, willing, and able to guide your family through this, through this time.
[03:17:40.336 --> 03:17:41.116]  You can do this.
[03:17:41.576 --> 03:17:42.497]  We will do this.
[03:17:42.757 --> 03:17:53.926]  And we will come out on the other end in control of the greatest country and restoring the greatest republic that this world has ever seen or ever known.

[03:18:59.998 --> 03:19:02.219]  Infowars.com, hour four.
[03:19:02.299 --> 03:19:06.261]  President Trump there about to appear at this rally.
[03:19:06.361 --> 03:19:07.722]  Chesapeake, Virginia.
[03:19:08.202 --> 03:19:12.505]  But at this hour, I do want to say that we do have breaking news.
[03:19:12.985 --> 03:19:16.967]  And so if we can get we get a quick two shot, we'll put that off and then we'll go blow it up.
[03:19:18.948 --> 03:19:20.088]  When Trump gets up.
[03:19:20.128 --> 03:19:22.069]  So make sure we'll take that when he gets out.
[03:19:22.369 --> 03:19:25.750]  But I do want to say that there is breaking news on Stephen K. Bannon.
[03:19:25.950 --> 03:19:29.791]  And we are a no man left behind kind of movement around here.
[03:19:29.831 --> 03:19:40.954]  And I want people to understand that because no man left behind means that you don't forget, even though the news cycle is completely insane right now, the Supreme Court has just denied Steve Bannon's bid.
[03:19:41.454 --> 03:19:45.857]  To remain free, pending appeal of his contempt conviction.
[03:19:46.237 --> 03:19:48.879]  The full court denied the application.
[03:19:49.299 --> 03:19:51.440]  He reports to prison July 1st.
[03:19:51.900 --> 03:19:53.241]  Details to come.
[03:19:53.681 --> 03:19:55.823]  So that means we're waiting for President Trump here still.
[03:19:56.403 --> 03:20:08.731]  That means Steve Bannon, Monday morning, this Monday, he will be there, FCI, Federal Corrections Institute, Danbury, in Connecticut.
[03:20:09.588 --> 03:20:13.371]  Surrendering himself, remaining in custody for four months.
[03:20:14.452 --> 03:20:27.081]  So that also means on the 4th of July, this 4th of July, when we're celebrating freedom and independence and celebrating this country that we all love and that we're all willing to sacrifice for.
[03:20:28.402 --> 03:20:30.423]  But there's a guy by the name of Steve Bannon.
[03:20:31.044 --> 03:20:34.606]  And there's another guy, by the way, by the name of Peter Navarro.
[03:20:35.475 --> 03:20:39.516]  And they're currently political prisoners in this country.
[03:20:41.157 --> 03:20:46.079]  And they're alongside the political prisoners in the DC gulag of January 6.
[03:20:46.159 --> 03:20:56.262]  So understand, in an uprising of unhumans, gulags will always follow.
[03:20:56.602 --> 03:20:59.563]  Political prisoners will always follow.
[03:20:59.943 --> 03:21:01.004]  There's no question.
[03:21:01.464 --> 03:21:02.984]  It always ends up this way.
[03:21:04.265 --> 03:21:11.206]   And Steve Bannon, Look, he could have complied with Nancy Pelosi.
[03:21:12.006 --> 03:21:18.129]  He could have complied with Nancy Pelosi and given her everything she wanted, except for a little thing called executive privilege.
[03:21:19.450 --> 03:21:20.871]  But he refused to do that.
[03:21:21.691 --> 03:21:29.056]  He refused to break executive privilege, go along with the show trial, and so they are doing what they do.
[03:21:29.824 --> 03:21:42.388]  They're locking up the opposition, locking up White House officials of the opposition, locking up opposition leaders, trying to shut down opposition media like this very program right now.
[03:21:44.149 --> 03:21:52.472]  So once you understand the system, once you understand the background, it's very clear and it's very obvious why they're doing this, because it's what they always do.
[03:21:52.952 --> 03:21:55.633]  They do it again and again and again and again.
[03:21:56.533 --> 03:21:57.454]  And that's the Supreme Court.
[03:21:58.271 --> 03:22:03.174]  Supreme Court saying that this has been pushed all the way through, and they're going to come in with this.
[03:22:03.234 --> 03:22:06.756]  Now, I believe Steve, by the way, this was an emergency injunction.
[03:22:07.756 --> 03:22:12.759]  Steve also has a separate appeal regarding executive privilege.
[03:22:13.220 --> 03:22:22.605]  And I do believe that his appeal potentially on executive privilege would be more advantageous to his success than others.
[03:22:22.665 --> 03:22:29.388]   Now, this was an emergency bid in order to stop The time, stop the surrender that's happening on Monday, July 1st.
[03:22:29.889 --> 03:22:36.652]  But his bid regarding executive privilege speaks directly to a separation of powers argument in the Constitution.
[03:22:36.692 --> 03:22:53.259]  Because the separation of powers Constitution argument would be that the January 6th committee, even though it was completely illegitimately constituted, as the House even came out and stated, which nullifies all the subpoenas, by the way.
[03:22:53.997 --> 03:23:00.198]   So it should nullify the subpoena for Bannon and nullify the subpoena for Trump and nullify
[03:23:00.198 --> 03:23:07.118]  the subpoena for Peter Navarro.
[03:23:07.118 --> 03:23:14.317]   In this one, the executive privilege argument comes in and says, President Trump was on
[03:23:14.317 --> 03:23:15.917]  the phone with Steve Bannon.
[03:23:16.588 --> 03:23:20.570]  The Jan 6 committee was asking for questions about that phone call.
[03:23:21.598 --> 03:23:26.039]  That's a legislative committee, member of the legislative branch, Congress.
[03:23:26.699 --> 03:23:32.101]  Congress doesn't have direct oversight over the president like that.
[03:23:32.381 --> 03:23:32.901]  Doesn't work.
[03:23:33.401 --> 03:23:34.381]  Executive privilege.
[03:23:35.002 --> 03:23:45.124]  This is, by the way, the exact same argument that they're using for Merrick Garland and the Robert Hur tapes from the special counsel's office.
[03:23:45.524 --> 03:23:47.685]  So just be clear right here.
[03:23:48.826 --> 03:23:54.548]  They're exerting executive privilege and saying that's why the special counsel doesn't have to release these tapes.
[03:23:54.588 --> 03:24:02.530]  And by the way, when you saw Biden last night up on that debate stage, imagine how bad these tapes must be.
[03:24:02.930 --> 03:24:07.112]  Imagine how bad he is on these tapes if they won't even release them.
[03:24:08.032 --> 03:24:11.173]  If they won't even put him out, it's gonna be really bad.
[03:24:11.213 --> 03:24:11.733]  He's up there.
[03:24:12.113 --> 03:24:12.733]  Who even knows?
[03:24:13.233 --> 03:24:14.673]  And I think they were playing it earlier.
[03:24:14.734 --> 03:24:16.734]  Thousands and billions, thousands of billions.
[03:24:16.774 --> 03:24:18.934]  All right, President Trump hasn't come out yet.
[03:24:18.974 --> 03:24:28.837]  So we've got, by the way, that clip prepared, the montage earlier that we were talking about of the people praising him, and then the same people knifing him in the back.
[03:24:28.857 --> 03:24:30.337]  Guys, let's play the Biden montage.
[03:24:31.909 --> 03:24:38.588]   Your tape right now because I'm about to tell you the truth and F you if you can't handle the truth this
[03:24:38.588 --> 03:24:43.869]  Version of Biden is the best Biden ever. Do you know lost?
[03:24:43.869 --> 03:24:49.269]   Let's see, no, so long as you denied in fact, I think he's better than he's ever been
[03:24:49.269 --> 03:24:58.639]   President Biden has a photographic memory His understanding and mastery of a complicated geopolitical situation is remarkable.
[03:24:58.879 --> 03:25:04.386]  He is sharp, intensely probing, and detail-oriented and focused.
[03:25:04.626 --> 03:25:05.387]  Jackie, are you here?
[03:25:05.808 --> 03:25:06.328]  Where's Jackie?
[03:25:06.869 --> 03:25:08.932]  I don't think she wants to be here.
[03:25:09.389 --> 03:25:15.310]  I was sitting, you know, two feet from him, across the table, and he was, you know, intense.
[03:25:15.530 --> 03:25:17.251]  Had trouble walking sometimes?
[03:25:17.311 --> 03:25:18.471]  Yeah, so did FDR.
[03:25:18.651 --> 03:25:19.891]  He wanted GD war.
[03:25:20.012 --> 03:25:22.072]  But he's totally focused, he's very sharp.
[03:25:22.092 --> 03:25:23.792]  They say he's sharp in meetings and so on.
[03:25:23.812 --> 03:25:26.333]  Very lucid, very well informed.
[03:25:26.413 --> 03:25:28.373]  Biden is state lead, he comes with gravitas.
[03:25:28.453 --> 03:25:34.635]  There hasn't been, as far as I know, a single claim that Biden made a mistake.
[03:25:35.316 --> 03:25:42.293]  Listen, if anybody in America thinks that that was even close to being an okay debate by Joe Biden.
[03:25:43.416 --> 03:25:44.697]  I'm living in a parallel universe.
[03:25:45.057 --> 03:25:49.321]  The universal reaction was somewhere approaching panic.
[03:25:49.501 --> 03:25:55.266]  Right now as we speak, there is a deep, a wide, and a very aggressive panic in the Democratic Party.
[03:25:55.426 --> 03:25:57.808]  There's a full-on panic about this performance.
[03:25:58.208 --> 03:25:59.449]  Biden had a terrible night.
[03:25:59.749 --> 03:26:00.990]  He could not land a thought.
[03:26:01.531 --> 03:26:05.354]  Not even in the closing statement, which is something, that's the easiest part.
[03:26:05.794 --> 03:26:09.117]  Write down a few words, go through, go through the thoughts.
[03:26:09.673 --> 03:26:15.258]  That was an unmitigated disaster for President Biden from the second he walked out to the closing statement.
[03:26:15.439 --> 03:26:16.820]  Again, it was terrible.
[03:26:17.100 --> 03:26:18.562]  It was terrible.
[03:26:18.662 --> 03:26:19.302]  That was painful.
[03:26:19.723 --> 03:26:21.805]  There's no way to spin it.
[03:26:21.825 --> 03:26:27.010]  I mean, can you say that you are not concerned at all having watched the president's performance tonight?
[03:26:27.350 --> 03:26:28.331]  It was a slow start.
[03:26:28.371 --> 03:26:29.412]  That's obvious to everyone.
[03:26:29.452 --> 03:26:30.753]  I'm not going to debate that point.
[03:26:31.093 --> 03:26:34.035]  Yeah, look, it was a really disappointing debate performance from Joe Biden.
[03:26:34.075 --> 03:26:36.197]  I don't think there's any way, any other way to slice it.
[03:26:36.317 --> 03:26:40.000]  President Biden seeming extremely feeble, seeming extremely weak.
[03:26:40.220 --> 03:26:47.666]  The only job that Joe Biden had last night was to reassure America that he was not too old to do the job.
[03:26:49.033 --> 03:26:49.754]  And he failed.
[03:26:50.214 --> 03:26:52.517]  Joe Biden's job was to reassure them tonight.
[03:26:53.137 --> 03:26:59.404]  His job was to calm his party, to make them feel that, yes, I can do this.
[03:26:59.584 --> 03:27:00.965]  I have four more years in me.
[03:27:01.386 --> 03:27:06.110]  I have the ability and the stamina and the strength to do four more years.
[03:27:06.551 --> 03:27:07.292]  He did not do that.
[03:27:07.752 --> 03:27:09.454]  Joe, you did such a great job.
[03:27:09.494 --> 03:27:11.396]  You answered every question.
[03:27:16.234 --> 03:27:19.575]  And let me ask the crowd, what did Trump do?
[03:27:19.595 --> 03:27:19.775]  LIE!
[03:27:21.674 --> 03:27:25.853]  This cannot be real life.
[03:27:25.853 --> 03:27:33.414]  [MUSIC]
[03:27:33.414 --> 03:27:34.513]  Start your tape right.
[03:27:34.513 --> 03:27:40.094]  Can't handle the truth.
[03:27:40.094 --> 03:27:44.614]   This version of Biden is the best Biden.
[03:27:49.414 --> 03:27:51.734]  So absolutely hilarious.
[03:27:51.905 --> 03:27:56.248]  The only thing, guys, okay, so I'm live reacting here.
[03:27:56.288 --> 03:27:57.670]  I was waiting for President Trump to come out.
[03:27:58.290 --> 03:28:01.453]  And it looks as you can see, the crowd is getting pretty amped up.
[03:28:01.513 --> 03:28:03.014]  I think he's on his way very soon.
[03:28:03.034 --> 03:28:05.837]  That the only thing that I would add is like.
[03:28:06.833 --> 03:28:12.433]   So put some music, bed some music under the second half of that as well, because there's
[03:28:12.433 --> 03:28:13.632]  music in the first half.
[03:28:13.632 --> 03:28:18.633]   But then add a record scratch or something right in the middle of when it switches from
[03:28:18.633 --> 03:28:19.873]  the first to the second.
[03:28:19.873 --> 03:28:26.352]   So like a kind of scratch so that you have that audio kind of break in between the two.
[03:28:26.352 --> 03:28:29.672]  By the way, huge, huge update.
[03:28:29.672 --> 03:28:31.872]  I'm seeing this right here.
[03:28:31.872 --> 03:28:36.633]  This is a tweet from high command for the Democrats.
[03:28:37.036 --> 03:28:39.217]  The tweet from high command is coming out.
[03:28:39.257 --> 03:28:40.878]  The orders are being sent.
[03:28:41.238 --> 03:28:43.219]  So remember what I talked about the kill switch?
[03:28:43.599 --> 03:28:45.400]  The kill switch was sent last night.
[03:28:45.420 --> 03:28:48.981]  They were going to try to get him to drop out last night.
[03:28:49.782 --> 03:28:50.482]  He refused.
[03:28:50.902 --> 03:28:57.365]  Now, all of a sudden, we have a tweet up from none other than Barack Obama himself.
[03:28:58.085 --> 03:28:59.085]  What is Obama saying?
[03:28:59.386 --> 03:28:59.986]  Oh, look at this.
[03:29:01.701 --> 03:29:03.423]  Bad debate nights happen.
[03:29:04.004 --> 03:29:05.125]  Trust me, I know.
[03:29:05.886 --> 03:29:14.457]  But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life, and someone who only cares about himself.
[03:29:14.937 --> 03:29:20.804]  Between someone who tells the truth, who knows right from wrong, and will give it to the American people straight.
[03:29:22.116 --> 03:29:24.979]  And someone who lies through his teeth for his own benefit.
[03:29:25.359 --> 03:29:26.861]  Last night didn't change that.
[03:29:27.221 --> 03:29:29.624]  And that's why so much is at stake in November.
[03:29:29.644 --> 03:29:32.287]  So that's Obama giving the media their talking points.
[03:29:32.567 --> 03:29:37.492]  That's Obama hitting the reset button saying, okay, okay, we gave them 24 hours of that.
[03:29:37.512 --> 03:29:38.533]  We gave them 24 hours of chaos.
[03:29:38.733 --> 03:29:41.013]  We gave them 24 hours of chaos.
[03:29:41.013 --> 03:29:48.373]   We gave them 24 hours of unmitigated disaster to see if we could dislodge him.
[03:29:48.373 --> 03:29:49.373]  He refused.
[03:29:49.373 --> 03:29:53.973]   And here's the dirty little secret, and Darren Beatty's got the thread up as well on his
[03:29:53.973 --> 03:29:54.973]  Twitter.
[03:29:54.973 --> 03:29:59.373]   He says, "Technically, the DNC has many hundreds of members, but actual nerve centers of the
[03:29:59.373 --> 03:30:02.173]  party is the committee, small enough to fit in."
[03:30:02.140 --> 03:30:04.664]  In a single DNC hotel room.
[03:30:04.684 --> 03:30:08.409]  Just 30 members of the Rules and Bylaws Committee.
[03:30:08.729 --> 03:30:11.513]  So you've heard of people on this committee.
[03:30:11.593 --> 03:30:15.318]  Frank Leone, Ken Martin, Donald McDonald, David McDonald.
[03:30:16.730 --> 03:30:22.832]  So members of this committee, they are the ones who decide whether or not these rules can be shifted.
[03:30:23.172 --> 03:30:29.594]  The problem is, of course, is that the rules as they state right now are that Biden himself has to drop out.
[03:30:30.014 --> 03:30:34.395]  And so what I'm telling you is that they're weighing the options.
[03:30:34.676 --> 03:30:44.038]  They spent 24 hours with the kill switch, the piranhas were loosed, and the piranhas were swarming in the water to see whether or not they would take him out.
[03:30:44.799 --> 03:30:45.539]  He didn't drop out.
[03:30:47.196 --> 03:30:49.418]  But Biden's not the one who's taking the decision anyway.
[03:30:49.698 --> 03:30:51.219]  Biden's not making the decision, Jill is.
[03:30:51.499 --> 03:31:01.527]  Jill's the one making the decision because she's the handler for the special needs kindergartner that we saw up there, walking him around, helping him out.
[03:31:01.927 --> 03:31:04.530]  And she's been doing this time and time again.
[03:31:04.950 --> 03:31:12.135]  It's so obvious that it doesn't even, we don't even need, we don't even need me to be the one here telling you that that's what's happening.
[03:31:12.155 --> 03:31:15.038]  You can all see it with your own two eyes.
[03:31:16.659 --> 03:31:18.571]  Don't let them tell you that you can't.
[03:31:18.591 --> 03:31:18.732]  That's 1984.
[03:31:21.755 --> 03:31:25.678]  The single, final, most important command of the party.
[03:31:26.198 --> 03:31:28.640]  Do not believe what you see with your eyes.
[03:31:28.921 --> 03:31:31.122]  Do not believe what you hear with your ears.
[03:31:31.543 --> 03:31:32.203]  That's 1984.
[03:31:33.724 --> 03:31:35.025]  Don't let them gaslight you.
[03:31:35.506 --> 03:31:37.787]  Don't let them tell you it's not happening.
[03:31:38.008 --> 03:31:38.948]  It's all happening.
[03:31:38.968 --> 03:31:41.370]  We saw every second of it.
[03:31:41.911 --> 03:31:43.972]  Jill Biden is the one who's the handler.
[03:31:44.252 --> 03:31:47.135]  Now, the oligarchs are the ones making the decisions.
[03:31:47.495 --> 03:31:50.938]  So Barack Obama comes out and he's pumping the brakes.
[03:31:51.638 --> 03:31:54.640]  He's pumping the brakes because he's saying, well, hold on, hold on.
[03:31:55.621 --> 03:31:56.842]  We might have to stick with Joe.
[03:31:57.142 --> 03:32:02.465]  So I told you before that Obama is not out there helping out Kamala Harris.
[03:32:02.726 --> 03:32:05.067]  No, she's not part of that faction.
[03:32:05.287 --> 03:32:05.928]  Understand this.
[03:32:07.452 --> 03:32:09.893]  Kamala Harris is not part of the Obama faction.
[03:32:10.133 --> 03:32:11.573]  She's not part of the Hillary faction.
[03:32:11.833 --> 03:32:15.735]  So you're going to see all of... No one faction has any control.
[03:32:16.015 --> 03:32:19.956]  So that's Obama using the big voice of the party.
[03:32:20.616 --> 03:32:25.258]  Coming out, that's the head of the party, that's Big Brother, coming out saying...
[03:32:26.308 --> 03:32:27.288]  This needs to stop.
[03:32:27.829 --> 03:32:30.410]  We're going to figure it out behind the scenes.
[03:32:31.150 --> 03:32:35.813]  Because he doesn't want it happening in public anymore, because no faction has dominance.
[03:32:36.133 --> 03:32:40.115]  And he realized how bad it was making the entire party look.
[03:32:40.395 --> 03:32:42.056]  It made the regime look weak.
[03:32:42.076 --> 03:32:57.113]   Which, by the way, if you're an actual adversary of the country, if you actually want to take down the United States, or if any group out there wanted the Chinese Communist Party, the cartels, MS-13, Isis, Isis-K, who just came across the border.
[03:32:57.394 --> 03:33:04.583]  If you wanted to do something and you knew that there was a crisis of leadership in the government, that's when you would do it.
[03:33:04.944 --> 03:33:07.087]  That's why it's a national security crisis.
[03:33:08.709 --> 03:33:12.294]  And so my question is to Speaker Johnson.
[03:33:14.119 --> 03:33:17.882]  Are you going to affirmatively whip the votes?
[03:33:18.162 --> 03:33:22.265]  Don't just come out there and say, oh, I support inherit contempt on Merrick Garland.
[03:33:22.986 --> 03:33:39.719]  Inherit contempt means the Sergeant at Arms of the House marches over there to Main Justice, right down the street, right down Constitution Avenue, and then down Pennsylvania, and arrests Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress.
[03:33:40.945 --> 03:33:43.626]  Are you going to whip the votes, Speaker Johnson?
[03:33:43.687 --> 03:33:44.407]  That's very nice.
[03:33:44.787 --> 03:33:48.589]  That's very nice that you came out with a statement that you said something that was good.
[03:33:48.949 --> 03:33:52.711]  Annapolina Luna, the great congresswoman, is the one putting up this measure.
[03:33:53.932 --> 03:33:55.313]  Now you need to go whip the votes.
[03:33:55.993 --> 03:33:56.874]  Go whip the votes.
[03:33:57.984 --> 03:33:58.644]  Go and look.
[03:33:59.465 --> 03:34:00.725]  You got the votes for Steve Bannon.
[03:34:01.025 --> 03:34:01.506]  Didn't work.
[03:34:02.246 --> 03:34:03.046]  At the Supreme Court.
[03:34:03.206 --> 03:34:04.287]  Okay, moving on.
[03:34:04.747 --> 03:34:06.968]  This is the reciprocity that we call for.
[03:34:07.628 --> 03:34:10.569]  None of this changes until we have reciprocity.
[03:34:10.850 --> 03:34:14.031]  None of this changes until Democrats are in handcuffs.
[03:34:14.471 --> 03:34:14.811]  Okay?
[03:34:15.171 --> 03:34:15.832]  That's how it works.
[03:34:15.852 --> 03:34:17.252]  And I don't mean indiscriminately.
[03:34:17.572 --> 03:34:23.475]  I'm talking about something that's called the iron law of exact reciprocity.
[03:34:24.602 --> 03:34:31.867]  And under the iron law of exact reciprocity, that which you do to us will be done back to you.
[03:34:32.647 --> 03:34:34.829]  In some cases, it will be done tenfold.
[03:34:35.469 --> 03:34:44.976]  Doxing, harassing, lawfare, lawfare against Infowars, lawfare against President Trump, his supporters.
[03:34:46.257 --> 03:34:50.820]  The people that are doing it to us will have it done directly back to them.
[03:34:52.421 --> 03:34:54.182]  Again, not indiscriminately.
[03:34:55.233 --> 03:35:03.418]  The Democrats up in Pennsylvania right now are running fake messages telling people that President Trump doesn't want them voting early.
[03:35:03.818 --> 03:35:16.666]  Because they're taking, what they've done is they've spliced videos of Trump talking about the 2020 election and then going back forward and saying that he doesn't want you to vote in the 2024 election.
[03:35:18.327 --> 03:35:20.969]  All of those Democrats arrested, every single one of them.
[03:35:22.410 --> 03:35:24.331]  Folks, understand.
[03:35:26.738 --> 03:35:27.298]  We are winning.
[03:35:27.939 --> 03:35:28.839]  Let me be clear about that.
[03:35:29.139 --> 03:35:30.780]  I know I've been a little bit doom and gloom today.
[03:35:31.460 --> 03:35:32.000]  We are winning.
[03:35:33.981 --> 03:35:36.362]  We have their backs against the wall.
[03:35:38.003 --> 03:35:39.343]  We have them cornered.
[03:35:41.044 --> 03:35:44.806]  They've still got things they can do, and they will.
[03:35:45.366 --> 03:35:50.668]  They've got options, but only if they ratchet it up to a degree we've never seen before.
[03:35:51.328 --> 03:35:57.394]   You've got Biden out there saying, That he's going along with that crowd that's chanting, lock up President Trump.
[03:35:58.295 --> 03:36:02.796]  And he's saying, there's more trials to come, and there's time for that.
[03:36:03.076 --> 03:36:13.100]  And you got this Democrat, Juan Marchand, whose daughter directly works with the Democrats, who's a guy, by the way, not even born in this country.
[03:36:14.520 --> 03:36:25.275]   No other country would ever have something like this, by the way, a foreign-born judge Convicting and sentencing a former president of the United States.
[03:36:25.295 --> 03:36:27.078]  So a former president or world leader.
[03:36:27.239 --> 03:36:28.060]  You just wouldn't have it.
[03:36:28.501 --> 03:36:29.482]  It would not exist.
[03:36:30.458 --> 03:36:31.599]  Imagine Russia would do that.
[03:36:31.619 --> 03:36:33.119]  Imagine China would do that.
[03:36:33.139 --> 03:36:33.920]  It's ridiculous.
[03:36:34.420 --> 03:36:35.420]  It's completely insane.
[03:36:35.440 --> 03:36:36.681]  It's only here in the West.
[03:36:37.221 --> 03:36:41.923]  Only here in the West do they demand that these things happen again and again and again.
[03:36:42.203 --> 03:37:02.424]   Because if you come from a part of the world that doesn't have any conception of our legal traditions, that doesn't have any conception of our values, that doesn't have any conception of our background and our culture and the things that we did to create This Western civilization that we have, then you just look at the law as a way, if you are an unhuman.
[03:37:03.203 --> 03:37:04.324]  You're an unhuman as well.
[03:37:05.144 --> 03:37:11.589]  And you look at the wall, the law, as a way to punish your enemies, as a tool that you can use in the toolbox.
[03:37:11.829 --> 03:37:20.595]  You don't look at the law as something sacred that should always be honored, that should always be used for striving towards justice.
[03:37:21.136 --> 03:37:22.717]  No, you don't believe in such things.
[03:37:22.737 --> 03:37:28.901]  In many cases, you don't even have the conception for those abstract concepts of higher law and higher justice.
[03:37:29.381 --> 03:37:29.882]  No, you don't.
[03:37:31.007 --> 03:37:38.232]  What you know is locking up your opponents and doing so out of petty greed and avarice and pride.
[03:37:38.453 --> 03:37:39.874]  And that's why you're the unhumans.
[03:37:40.394 --> 03:37:40.994]  That is why.
[03:37:41.315 --> 03:37:43.376]  By the way, President Trump still hasn't come out here.
[03:37:44.137 --> 03:37:45.618]  We've only got about five minutes left.
[03:37:46.018 --> 03:37:48.760]  But if they want to take that, I'm sure you guys can check it out later.
[03:37:49.100 --> 03:37:54.504]  I expect this is going to be a very, very interesting rally with President Trump.
[03:37:56.526 --> 03:37:57.547]  And I'll leave it with this, folks.
[03:37:59.482 --> 03:38:01.363]  I'll leave it with this in my last couple of minutes here.
[03:38:03.924 --> 03:38:04.564]  We're close.
[03:38:05.984 --> 03:38:14.548]  We're so close right now to having Trump returned and restored as the rightful President of the United States.
[03:38:17.189 --> 03:38:19.189]  This interregnum will end.
[03:38:20.370 --> 03:38:28.753]  And with it, when he is restored, the new American Republic itself will be restored.
[03:38:30.458 --> 03:38:32.080]  And that means things will change.
[03:38:32.300 --> 03:38:33.401]  They absolutely will change.
[03:38:33.481 --> 03:38:38.746]  First and foremost, pardons for the political prisoners.
[03:38:39.687 --> 03:38:40.347]  That's day one.
[03:38:41.668 --> 03:38:44.391]  The mass deportations will commence.
[03:38:45.752 --> 03:38:48.395]  And by the way, that doesn't mean, you know, so I had this debate the other night.
[03:38:49.440 --> 03:38:51.921]  With the libertarian presidential candidate, Chase Oliver.
[03:38:52.722 --> 03:38:55.023]  And they were saying, well, it's going to cost you a trillion dollars.
[03:38:55.263 --> 03:38:58.445]  It'll cost you a trillion dollars to deport 20 million people.
[03:38:58.485 --> 03:38:59.445]  A trillion dollars.
[03:38:59.485 --> 03:39:01.546]  Shouldn't we use that trillion dollars for something else?
[03:39:01.967 --> 03:39:03.928]  Shouldn't we use that for something more important?
[03:39:04.268 --> 03:39:10.711]  And I would say, well, first of all, I'm not sure what's more important than stopping the invasion of our country.
[03:39:10.951 --> 03:39:13.292]  That where there's a massive invasion going on right now.
[03:39:13.332 --> 03:39:15.714]  I'm pretty sure that's kind of important, something to do.
[03:39:16.674 --> 03:39:25.621]  And when we take power back, and we will be taking power back, and I want people to understand that, this is one of the first things, and certainly will be the first thing that is stopped, is the invasion.
[03:39:26.642 --> 03:39:37.870]  Because when you're running a coalition of the fringes, like the left is doing, when you're running an unhuman uprising, what do you do other than to try to increase the level of those fringes?
[03:39:37.890 --> 03:39:51.199]   So you would want invaders, you would want migrants, you would want people that don't have any connection to our home, that don't have any connection to our values, You would want to increase their numbers in our society so that you could start flipping states like you did with California.
[03:39:51.219 --> 03:39:58.964]  Remember, California was a state that used to vote for Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon before that, and then is now voting solid blue.
[03:39:59.305 --> 03:40:04.408]  Arizona was the state that gave us one of the strongest anti-communists ever, Barry Goldwater.
[03:40:04.748 --> 03:40:05.669]  Now it's blue.
[03:40:06.290 --> 03:40:09.574]  Wisconsin was a state that gave us Senator Joseph McCarthy.
[03:40:09.834 --> 03:40:11.235]  And now they're a swing state.
[03:40:11.255 --> 03:40:12.577]  It's very hard for Republicans.
[03:40:12.597 --> 03:40:15.780]  You do still get some, but very hard for Republicans to win.
[03:40:15.820 --> 03:40:18.684]  By the way, we talk a lot about Joseph McCarthy in this book.
[03:40:19.189 --> 03:40:21.210]  I'm very upset when I say McCarthy was right.
[03:40:21.291 --> 03:40:22.651]  Well, what was he right about?
[03:40:23.032 --> 03:40:28.035]  Was he right about the fact that there was a communist infiltration of the State Department?
[03:40:28.456 --> 03:40:31.037]  That there was a communist infiltration coming of the CIA?
[03:40:31.078 --> 03:40:32.999]  A communist infiltration coming of Hollywood?
[03:40:33.279 --> 03:40:36.501]  A communist infiltration coming of every institution in America?
[03:40:36.742 --> 03:40:37.962]  That's what Joseph McCarthy said!
[03:40:38.863 --> 03:40:53.892]  And by the way, the Verona intercepts that we put out in this book also show the declassified NSA cables and declassified Soviet codes that have all the code names of every single member of the NKVDs.
[03:40:54.492 --> 03:40:56.854]  And the KGB's operatives here in America.
[03:40:57.154 --> 03:41:06.760]  And some of the names might surprise you because they are the names of the people that were building the nuclear program, that were building the nuclear bombs, and then leaked it to the Soviet Union.
[03:41:07.041 --> 03:41:10.823]  They were the traitors, and a number of those traitors got exactly what they deserved.
[03:41:11.263 --> 03:41:13.845]  So when we talk about this, that's what we say.
[03:41:14.325 --> 03:41:20.089]  That's what we say from the very start when we talk about McCarthy being right.
[03:41:20.950 --> 03:41:22.151]  Okay, I see us zooming in now.
[03:41:22.171 --> 03:41:23.852]  Does it look like President Trump is coming out?
[03:41:27.193 --> 03:41:28.214]  I think we're close, folks.
[03:41:28.054 --> 03:41:34.054]  I think we're close.
[03:41:34.054 --> 03:41:36.054]  Look at this.
[03:41:36.201 --> 03:41:37.463]  This is presidential.
[03:41:38.884 --> 03:41:45.030]  This is the new leader of a new era in American politics.
[03:41:45.550 --> 03:41:47.172]  An era of prosperity.
[03:41:47.232 --> 03:41:48.833]  An era of peace.
[03:41:49.904 --> 03:41:51.345]  An era of freedom.
[03:41:51.485 --> 03:41:52.346]  Go out on this, guys.
[03:41:52.386 --> 03:41:54.427]  President Donald J. Trump!
[03:41:54.608 --> 03:42:02.053]  And I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free.
[03:42:02.614 --> 03:42:08.378]  And I won't forget the men who died who gave that fight to me.
[03:42:08.438 --> 03:42:15.483]  And I gladly stand up next to you and admit hurt still today.
[03:42:15.342 --> 03:42:27.342]   'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land God bless the USA
[03:42:27.342 --> 03:42:42.342]   From the lakes of Minnesota To the hills of Tennessee
[03:42:42.342 --> 03:42:49.342]   Across the plains of Texas From sea to shining sea
[03:42:49.342 --> 03:42:55.342]   From Detroit down to Houston And New York to L.A.
[03:42:55.342 --> 03:42:59.769]   Where there's pride in every hour President Trump coming out now.
[03:42:59.789 --> 03:43:01.410]  Ties off.
[03:43:01.610 --> 03:43:03.672]  Looking loose.
[03:43:03.712 --> 03:43:04.292]  Looking limber.
[03:43:04.312 --> 03:43:05.653]  He's got the red hat on.
[03:43:06.693 --> 03:43:07.614]  Flags waving.
[03:43:07.634 --> 03:43:09.555]  It's an outdoor rally in Chesapeake.
[03:43:11.756 --> 03:43:13.998]  People holding up the mugshot.
[03:43:14.118 --> 03:43:14.958]  Never surrender.
[03:43:15.719 --> 03:43:19.501]  Never surrender has become the new motto of this movement.
[03:43:21.129 --> 03:43:22.110]  And it's a motto for Trump.
[03:43:22.751 --> 03:43:24.773]  Remember where we were three years ago.
[03:43:25.452 --> 03:43:28.452]  Remember where we were January 7th.
[03:43:28.452 --> 03:43:32.653]   And when we came out with Nitric Boost three years ago, it was a sleeper product.
[03:43:32.653 --> 03:43:33.652]  I didn't even promote it.
[03:43:33.652 --> 03:43:38.772]   But as listeners began to use it, it has become one of our top selling products because of
[03:43:38.772 --> 03:43:40.252]  the incredible results they get.
[03:43:40.252 --> 03:43:45.011]   If you want to give your cardiovascular system a leg up, if you want to go in and help clean
[03:43:45.011 --> 03:43:49.852]   out and purify your blood, ladies and gentlemen, Nitric Boost is the way to go.
[03:43:49.836 --> 03:43:52.758]  You've heard Dr. Judy Mikovits talk about how it's an amazing formula.
[03:43:53.078 --> 03:43:54.680]  This is what she's recommended to people.
[03:43:54.960 --> 03:43:58.503]  Ladies and gentlemen, it does so many great things.
[03:43:58.883 --> 03:44:01.345]  But you notice what happens in the morning if you're a man.
[03:44:01.365 --> 03:44:03.187]  I feel like I'm 16 years old again.
[03:44:03.507 --> 03:44:07.769]  When I was 16, I'd already had probably a... I hate to brag, so I'm not bragging.
[03:44:07.829 --> 03:44:08.590]  It's actually shameful.
[03:44:08.810 --> 03:44:10.390]  Probably 150 women or more.
[03:44:10.711 --> 03:44:11.331]  That's conservative.
[03:44:11.691 --> 03:44:13.392]  Nitric Boost is simply amazing.
[03:44:13.432 --> 03:44:14.633]  It's great for women as well.
