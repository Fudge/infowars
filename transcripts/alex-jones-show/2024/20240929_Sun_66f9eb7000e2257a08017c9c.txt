[00:00:06.853 --> 00:00:13.100]  The dislike of and anguish over social media is just growing and growing and growing.
[00:00:14.702 --> 00:00:21.769]  And it's part of our problem, particularly in democracies, in terms of building consensus around any issue.
[00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.112]  It's really hard to govern today.
[00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:34.209]  You can't, you know, there's no, the referees we used to have to determine what's a fact and what isn't a fact have kind of, you know, been eviscerated to a certain degree.
[00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:43.634]  The American taxpayers, my constituents that are having a hard time afford their groceries, pay for a car, buy a new home, spend 1.6 quadrillion dollars
[00:00:44.514 --> 00:01:08.193]  to fix a problem that a doesn't exist and as a matter of fact you might be exacerbating because it's unknown it is unknown at this time the low level that of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that might actually destroy life because plant life all depends as you know secretary plant life all depends on co2 and when we kill it then we're done too
[00:01:08.974 --> 00:01:09.675]  I yield the balance.
[00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:15.340]  Congressman, let me just say that I don't agree with what you're saying out there for any number of reasons.
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:28.913]  I don't have time to go into all of them now, but I'll just tell you point blank that the difference between the periods you're looking at in terms of heat, et cetera, and human input is night and day, number one.
[00:01:30.563 --> 00:01:38.588]  Why do you think 195 countries in the world, their prime ministers, their presidents... Because they're grifting like you are, sir.
[00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:56.760]  But look, if people go to only one source, and the source they go to is sick, and, you know, has an agenda, and they're putting out disinformation, our First Amendment stands as a major block to the ability to be able to just, you know, hammer it out of existence.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.302]  So what you need, what we need, is to
[00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:11.686]  ...is to win the ground, win the right to govern by hopefully winning enough votes that you're free to be able to implement change.
[00:02:12.906 --> 00:02:17.029]  Now, obviously, there are some people in our country who are prepared to implement change in other ways.
[00:02:18.283 --> 00:02:24.550]  You're questioning really if democracy can survive unregulated social media?
[00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:36.163]  I think democracies are very challenged right now and have not proven they can move fast enough or big enough to deal with the challenges that we are facing.
[00:02:36.886 --> 00:02:41.187]  And to me, that is part of what this race, this election is all about.
[00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:44.428]  Will we break the fever in the United States?
[00:02:44.848 --> 00:02:55.651]  See, while always ensuring and defending free speech, we must make it clear that it cannot be okay to bully and attack people online.
[00:02:56.653 --> 00:03:11.705]  Governments, and especially big technology companies, need to safeguard people's data and privacy and address online harassment and violence to ensure trust in technology.
[00:03:12.273 --> 00:03:15.875]  The Socialist Democratic Party just can't help prodding the sleeping giant.
[00:03:16.015 --> 00:03:20.877]  The left has made it abundantly clear that they want our president not just impeached, but beheaded.
[00:03:21.137 --> 00:03:22.998]  They have pushed that narrative repeatedly.
[00:03:23.158 --> 00:03:28.580]  But first, they must decapitate Infowars so that the heads of conservatives will roll.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.942]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[00:03:34.363 --> 00:03:39.545]  He launched similar attacks against the families whose six- and seven-year-old kids were slaughtered at Sandy Hook.
[00:03:40.265 --> 00:03:41.346]  These people are all lawyers.
[00:03:41.386 --> 00:03:42.067]  They're very smart.
[00:03:42.608 --> 00:03:55.602]  They've defamed me in fake lawsuits they filed, funded by the Democratic Party, knowing they're protected filing false statements under defamation in lawsuits, and then they do it as members of Congress protected with immunity for false statements.
[00:03:56.556 --> 00:04:15.127]  The Slade article references a study by Jonathan Albright, director of the Tau Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia, who found 9,000 videos on YouTube with titles that are, and I quote, a mixture of shocking, vile, and promotional themes that include rape game jokes, shock reality, social experiments, celebrity pedophilia, false flag rants,
[00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:19.308]  And terror-related conspiracy theories dating back to the Oklahoma City attacks
[00:04:32.353 --> 00:04:39.216]  Every one of your rights has been compromised by a totalitarian state grown to adulthood under your very nose.
[00:04:39.516 --> 00:04:44.138]  But the First Amendment is still holding its ground under a hail of globalist arrows.
[00:04:44.438 --> 00:04:46.739]  But it can't withstand the assault forever.
[00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.739]  We are reaching the critical moment.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.881]  Stand up, America, and reclaim your rights.
[00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:55.062]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:05:00.598 --> 00:05:02.280]  It is Sunday, September 29th, 2024.
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.244]  I am your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:05:07.764 --> 00:05:12.088]  We'll put on screen how many days we are out from the U.S.
[00:05:12.268 --> 00:05:12.889]  election.
[00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.671]  The most important election in world history.
[00:05:15.692 --> 00:05:17.793]  36 days, 7 hours, 53 minutes, 11 seconds.
[00:05:20.896 --> 00:05:21.136]  All right.
[00:05:21.156 --> 00:05:29.343]  The former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and the former top national security advisor for President Trump will be joining us coming up in about 40 minutes live in studio for over an hour.
[00:05:29.423 --> 00:05:30.724]  General Michael Flynn.
[00:05:31.485 --> 00:05:42.433]  And he will, of course, break down all the different globalist attempts to steal the election right in front of our eyes and the attempts on President Trump's life and what he believes the globalists are gonna be trying in the next 37 days.
[00:05:42.974 --> 00:05:46.016]  And if Trump's able to get through all the fraud and we're able to get through it, he gets in.
[00:05:46.337 --> 00:05:50.280]  Then what happens in the 76 days when he's president elect when all hell
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.202]  Is going to break loose in my.
[00:05:53.143 --> 00:05:54.745]  View in my prediction here.
[00:05:55.787 --> 00:05:56.107]  All right.
[00:05:59.251 --> 00:06:04.218]  We've got Israel and war as it was predicted, just expanding all over the places.
[00:06:04.338 --> 00:06:06.441]  Israel strikes four countries in the last few days.
[00:06:07.828 --> 00:06:13.511]  We've got ongoing big developments with Ukraine and Zelensky.
[00:06:14.671 --> 00:06:17.192]  And all the different things that are unfolding there.
[00:06:18.173 --> 00:06:21.754]  We have incredible news coming out on the border and Kamala's visit.
[00:06:22.514 --> 00:06:25.996]  Now claiming she was the greatest border czar ever after claiming she wasn't the border czar.
[00:06:26.916 --> 00:06:31.358]  And you've got walls and her being booed by crowds everywhere they travel.
[00:06:32.038 --> 00:06:32.639]  And then Trump
[00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:42.401]  Getting huge standing ovations at college football games in Alabama, while walls gets booed and chased out in Michigan.
[00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:44.662]  But we're told by the fake polls.
[00:06:45.582 --> 00:06:45.762]  That.
[00:06:48.863 --> 00:06:50.963]  Kamala Harris and Tim Walzert ahead.
[00:06:53.444 --> 00:06:54.164]  And then we've got.
[00:06:55.304 --> 00:06:57.065]  What I want to start with first, and that is the
[00:07:04.073 --> 00:07:09.957]  That are attacking sovereignty and human health and freedom and mobility and bringing in their global cashless society.
[00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:18.001]  Announcing at the WHO and the UN and the WEF and the Congress and the EU and all of them.
[00:07:18.922 --> 00:07:23.725]  Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Tim Walz and the list goes on and on in the New York Times.
[00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:26.547]  Saying the First Amendment's bad.
[00:07:26.687 --> 00:07:28.148]  It's time to repeal it.
[00:07:28.208 --> 00:07:29.528]  It's time to ban it.
[00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.630]  It's time to put people in jail.
[00:07:32.765 --> 00:07:37.027]  Because the public doesn't believe what the corporate media and government says anymore.
[00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:44.952]  And so we've got to silence everybody because you're a pack of lying scum caught in so many lies it makes my head spin.
[00:07:45.532 --> 00:07:51.496]  These are the people with the corporate and governmental censorship boards that will decide what's real and what isn't.
[00:07:52.196 --> 00:07:57.980]  And they are the world champion liars and gaslighters and BS artists the planet's ever seen.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.865]  Do I need to list all the record lies of Kamala recently on the debate stage with Trump?
[00:08:05.466 --> 00:08:06.787]  Trump, you want to ban fracking.
[00:08:06.807 --> 00:08:07.467]  That's insane.
[00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:08.148]  I never said that.
[00:08:08.168 --> 00:08:08.788]  You're a liar.
[00:08:09.148 --> 00:08:09.849]  Hundreds of clips.
[00:08:10.769 --> 00:08:12.050]  You want to ban semi-autos.
[00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.771]  I never said that.
[00:08:12.831 --> 00:08:13.672]  I love guns.
[00:08:14.152 --> 00:08:16.474]  Two days before, it said she wants to ban all semi-auto.
[00:08:16.734 --> 00:08:20.897]  Three days later, her official policy paper put out saying ban all semi-autos.
[00:08:22.951 --> 00:08:23.091]  On.
[00:08:24.251 --> 00:08:24.892]  And on.
[00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:26.512]  And on.
[00:08:27.472 --> 00:08:29.273]  Then saying she was the greatest border czar.
[00:08:29.293 --> 00:08:30.433]  Then she was never the border czar.
[00:08:30.473 --> 00:08:32.033]  Now she's the greatest border czar ever.
[00:08:32.894 --> 00:08:35.014]  Saying the last four years have been hell.
[00:08:35.254 --> 00:08:36.935]  We're going to change it once we get in.
[00:08:37.135 --> 00:08:38.035]  You've been in.
[00:08:38.975 --> 00:08:42.796]  They're just trying to murder logic in front of everybody's face 24-7.
[00:08:42.816 --> 00:08:43.736]  It really is.
[00:08:43.816 --> 00:08:44.556]  Next level.
[00:08:51.345 --> 00:08:56.770]  But if you look, and there's so many videos, I'll try to air them, but if I do, we won't have any time to even cover the news.
[00:08:57.311 --> 00:08:57.771]  It's everywhere.
[00:08:57.791 --> 00:09:00.714]  If you want to see it, go to X. She's being booed at the border.
[00:09:02.055 --> 00:09:02.776]  Protested.
[00:09:04.257 --> 00:09:06.840]  Walls is being booed and run out of football games.
[00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:09.763]  Trump gets giant standing ovations everywhere.
[00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:13.465]  They stole the election four years ago.
[00:09:13.485 --> 00:09:15.447]  They're trying to steal it again.
[00:09:15.987 --> 00:09:17.468]  Trump is more popular than ever.
[00:09:18.069 --> 00:09:20.230]  And they know they've only got so much fraud baked in.
[00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:22.312]  If Trump has a big enough landslide, he'll win.
[00:09:22.592 --> 00:09:24.894]  And that's why they tried to kill him at least twice we know of.
[00:09:25.354 --> 00:09:29.997]  They've got all these foreign hit teams in the country that they claim they're not involved in.
[00:09:30.358 --> 00:09:32.579]  But the deep state has the motive to get rid of Trump.
[00:09:32.859 --> 00:09:36.062]  We'll talk about that with General Flynn coming up in studio.
[00:09:37.583 --> 00:09:38.884]  But let's go to a little clip here.
[00:09:40.465 --> 00:09:43.728]  Of Kerry and then Clinton and then walls.
[00:09:44.608 --> 00:09:47.310]  And then back into carry the larger clip in context.
[00:09:48.211 --> 00:09:52.975]  Literally saying, Oh, well, there's all these lies and we've got to be able to counter all of that.
[00:09:53.495 --> 00:09:55.096]  We've got to be able to deal with all of that.
[00:09:55.216 --> 00:09:59.560]  So we have the First Amendment standing in our way.
[00:10:01.092 --> 00:10:11.516]  And all the New York Times and Washington Post headlines and the American Psychological Association came out Thursday and said, we need to teach children not to ask questions.
[00:10:11.596 --> 00:10:13.257]  We need to teach people not to ask questions.
[00:10:13.277 --> 00:10:16.118]  New York Times headline, why asking questions is bad.
[00:10:17.319 --> 00:10:25.362]  Because if you ask questions, you'll know that people telling you two men can have a baby and there's not X and Y chromosomes now are liars.
[00:10:26.963 --> 00:10:29.764]  So they're publicly out of desperation
[00:10:30.987 --> 00:10:33.728]  Declaring war on speech.
[00:10:33.968 --> 00:10:36.029]  That is not a symbol of their strength.
[00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:38.129]  It is a symbol of the fraud they are.
[00:10:38.169 --> 00:10:39.350]  But don't get too confident.
[00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:48.152]  Because they're planning power outages, cyber attacks, wars, false flag attacks, to be blamed on their opposition worldwide.
[00:10:48.713 --> 00:10:55.815]  And they're even more panicked because in every election, it is the populist and the anti-globalist being elected.
[00:10:58.419 --> 00:11:19.634]  Unless there's, in the case of fake conservative groups in, like Labor, just got in power with 18% of the vote, using a parliamentary manipulation with a coalition, because the fake conservatives were in power, so everybody voted them out, and then the left was able to do a coalition and get back into power, but they're even more unpopular.
[00:11:20.592 --> 00:11:25.495]  The conservatives got like 27% of the vote and then liberals got 18, but they're still in power.
[00:11:25.515 --> 00:11:28.697]  But everywhere else where there's a straight up election.
[00:11:30.619 --> 00:11:37.003]  The conservatives are winning just in Austria's right wing Freedom Party receives most votes in today's election wins.
[00:11:38.084 --> 00:11:42.627]  But now will a coalition of leftist groups form and still outvote them?
[00:11:42.667 --> 00:11:46.429]  Because again, they have dozens of parties, not two main ones like we do.
[00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:47.310]  That's how
[00:11:48.851 --> 00:11:51.152]  Netanyahu has 19% of the vote.
[00:11:52.973 --> 00:11:54.713]  Trudeau got 19% of the vote.
[00:11:56.234 --> 00:11:58.195]  Macron got, what, 16% of the vote.
[00:11:59.795 --> 00:12:03.357]  That's parliamentary manipulation, so they're not popular.
[00:12:04.403 --> 00:12:12.767]  But every election cycle, the anti-globalists get closer and closer to having such a big majority that they can override all the others.
[00:12:13.167 --> 00:12:20.150]  And that's why they're trying to arrest everybody and shut down free speech because we're inches away, all over the world.
[00:12:22.311 --> 00:12:24.151]  And what does the UN say?
[00:12:24.171 --> 00:12:29.554]  They want NATO and the UN to be able to ban people criticizing the next lockdown, the next poison shot.
[00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:32.022]  Everything they said about the shot was a lie.
[00:12:32.062 --> 00:12:32.563]  Remember that?
[00:12:33.224 --> 00:12:34.407]  They were the ones that were lying.
[00:12:34.607 --> 00:12:37.252]  But they're the ones that will decide what is the truth.
[00:12:38.594 --> 00:12:39.175]  On your body.
[00:12:39.917 --> 00:12:40.999]  On your right to self-defense.
[00:12:41.139 --> 00:12:41.920]  On your right to travel.
[00:12:43.168 --> 00:12:50.411]  And if they get their cashless society in place, their central bank digital currency that's already being rolled out in most parts of the world, China's had it for six, seven years.
[00:12:51.232 --> 00:13:00.396]  If you think JD Vance being denied access into an Italian restaurant chain in Pennsylvania, where they tried to just have a meal with some of his supporters.
[00:13:01.721 --> 00:13:08.425]  If you think the left's going to stop there, that's just the tip of the iceberg with the social credit score.
[00:13:09.065 --> 00:13:09.706]  So here's a short.
[00:13:10.446 --> 00:13:12.807]  Compilation and in it is the new announcement.
[00:13:12.827 --> 00:13:15.589]  The full five minute clip is an info wars dot com.
[00:13:15.609 --> 00:13:18.030]  If you want to see it of Kerry explaining.
[00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:22.713]  Why we've got to get rid of the First Amendment now last year and again this year, he said.
[00:13:22.873 --> 00:13:27.135]  Farming is bad and organic farming is the worst and we've got a quote.
[00:13:27.256 --> 00:13:28.476]  Get rid of a third of the world's
[00:13:33.049 --> 00:13:41.936]  That's like saying I need to put a noose around your neck and drop through a hatch in the floor and break your neck so you can breathe better.
[00:13:42.577 --> 00:13:47.080]  Or here, let me cut your head off in a guillotine so you'll be healthier.
[00:13:47.881 --> 00:13:50.383]  Let me pour gasoline on you and light it so you'll live longer.
[00:13:51.183 --> 00:13:59.570]  I mean, it's just, by the way, if you're a new viewer and you're like, or a new listener and you're like, John Kerry said we've got to get rid of farms or people will starve.
[00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.631]  That's an actual quote.
[00:14:03.345 --> 00:14:03.625]  Okay.
[00:14:04.085 --> 00:14:08.307]  And the UN's got their big global summit calling for AI to censor and control everybody.
[00:14:08.587 --> 00:14:09.807]  They just did that Thursday.
[00:14:09.847 --> 00:14:10.788]  I've got that report.
[00:14:11.888 --> 00:14:17.630]  This is just absolutely incredible that the mask is off at this level.
[00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.851]  Here's the compilation.
[00:14:20.931 --> 00:14:27.594]  Our first amendment stands as a major block to the ability to be able to just, you know, hammer it out of existence.
[00:14:27.634 --> 00:14:30.135]  So what you need, what we need is to
[00:14:31.332 --> 00:14:39.962]  ...is to win the ground, win the right to govern by hopefully winning enough votes that you're free to be able to...
[00:14:40.876 --> 00:14:42.497]  To implement change.
[00:14:42.997 --> 00:14:45.119]  And boosting Trump back in 2016.
[00:14:45.579 --> 00:14:52.304]  But I also think there are Americans who are engaged in this kind of propaganda.
[00:14:53.304 --> 00:15:01.810]  And whether they should be civilly or even in some cases criminally charged is something that would be a better deterrence.
[00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:03.811]  I think we need to push back on this.
[00:15:03.851 --> 00:15:09.595]  There's no guarantee to free speech on misinformation or hate speech, and especially around our democracy.
[00:15:09.616 --> 00:15:10.596]  It's so tough.
[00:15:10.716 --> 00:15:12.538]  Everybody's wrestling with that right now.
[00:15:14.339 --> 00:15:21.664]  And I think the dislike of and anguish over social media is just growing and growing and growing.
[00:15:23.286 --> 00:15:26.128]  And it's part of our problem, particularly in democracies.
[00:15:27.208 --> 00:15:30.291]  Uh, in terms of building consensus around any issue.
[00:15:30.311 --> 00:15:32.713]  It's really hard to govern today.
[00:15:33.834 --> 00:15:42.721]  You can't—you know, there's no— The referees we used to have to determine what's a fact and what isn't a fact have kind of, you know, been eviscerated to a certain degree.
[00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:50.284]  And people go and then people self-select where they go for their news or for their information.
[00:15:50.684 --> 00:15:52.585]  And then you just get into a vicious cycle.
[00:15:53.086 --> 00:16:00.529]  So it's really, really hard, much harder to build consensus today than at any time in the 45, 50 years I've been involved in this.
[00:16:02.997 --> 00:16:13.562]  There's a lot of discussion now about how you curb those entities in order to guarantee that you're going to have some accountability on facts, etc.
[00:16:14.322 --> 00:16:23.946]  But look, if people go to only one source, and the source they go to is sick, and has an agenda, and they're putting out disinformation,
[00:16:25.467 --> 00:16:32.111]  Our First Amendment stands as a major block to the ability to be able to just, you know, hammer it out of existence.
[00:16:32.171 --> 00:16:47.079]  So what you need, what we need, is to win the ground, win the right to govern by hopefully having, you know, winning enough votes that you're free to be able to implement change.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.422]  Now, obviously, there are some people in our country who are prepared to implement change in other ways.
[00:16:53.659 --> 00:16:54.640]  And that's where we're at.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:59.283]  So that's the guy in the UN is doing it in the Netherlands and Ireland Sri Lanka all over.
[00:16:59.323 --> 00:17:00.303]  They're just banning.
[00:17:01.744 --> 00:17:07.568]  Every year on average, 10% of the farms and ranches because quote they're toxic, though they're not.
[00:17:08.508 --> 00:17:12.291]  But see cows put off methane, even though we do, too.
[00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:15.453]  It's part of the atmosphere, but they can listen as a toxin.
[00:17:15.473 --> 00:17:19.135]  It's like carbon dioxide has been listed as evil.
[00:17:19.695 --> 00:17:20.596]  What do you exhale?
[00:17:20.736 --> 00:17:22.037]  What a plant used to live.
[00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:32.932]  See how that works?
[00:17:34.592 --> 00:17:37.533]  Now, I mentioned the U.N.
[00:17:37.553 --> 00:17:38.594]  so let me show you these articles.
[00:17:39.394 --> 00:17:47.217]  John Kerry derides First Amendment as major roadblock to government being able to hammer, that's a quote, dissent out of existence.
[00:17:48.217 --> 00:17:50.858]  Well, that sounds pretty totalitarian.
[00:17:50.898 --> 00:18:01.303]  Here's the United Nations Summit of the Future Outcome Documents, September 2024, Pact for the Future, Global, Digital, Compact, and Declaration of Future Generations.
[00:18:02.804 --> 00:18:17.451]  And they say, I covered it Friday, that AI will watch and censor in live time, they'll put you in jail, and deny man-made climate change and there are solutions to it, or you criticize open borders, or you report on anything they don't like.
[00:18:18.584 --> 00:18:19.866]  Or you don't want a poison shot.
[00:18:20.727 --> 00:18:26.154]  Or you criticize brainwashing children that are autistic that should have their genitals cut off.
[00:18:27.636 --> 00:18:30.219]  Meanwhile, in Germany, this happens every day.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.865]  If you report on it locally and say that it's Islamists doing it, you go to jail for two years.
[00:18:34.925 --> 00:18:35.606]  Same thing in the UK.
[00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:44.600]  Well, today, Germany, a machete-wielding Syrian, injures 31 during arson rampage, also burning everything down.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.985]  There's videos and photos if you'd like to see it for yourself on InfoWars.com.
[00:18:50.166 --> 00:18:56.014]  Then the media spins it like Trump's a police state thug when he says, I'll sign an executive order.
[00:18:57.418 --> 00:19:02.059]  That if the government colludes illegally with big tech to censor election information, you'll go to jail.
[00:19:02.319 --> 00:19:03.159]  That's already illegal.
[00:19:03.619 --> 00:19:04.919]  He says he'll sign another executive order.
[00:19:05.379 --> 00:19:08.000]  They spin it like, oh, he's going to prosecute his enemies.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.800]  That's Yahoo News and International Business Times.
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:17.522]  Trump vows to prosecute Google for surfacing only bad stories about him.
[00:19:17.542 --> 00:19:21.702]  Well, they wouldn't even say for two months that Trump had been shot or it was an assassination attempt, remember?
[00:19:23.483 --> 00:19:24.723]  That's like the lie
[00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:32.213]  That you hear over and over and over again.
[00:19:33.374 --> 00:19:36.376]  That Republicans are burning books and banning books.
[00:19:36.496 --> 00:19:36.756]  No.
[00:19:37.717 --> 00:19:44.161]  Republicans aren't going to the local porn shop and saying they can't sell Hustler to adults.
[00:19:44.882 --> 00:19:46.123]  Says 18 to come in the store.
[00:19:46.903 --> 00:19:53.288]  They're saying you don't give pedophilic pornography to
[00:19:55.054 --> 00:19:56.735]  Children as young as fifth grade.
[00:19:57.935 --> 00:20:03.298]  And we've gone to the Austin library for A. S. A I s t years ago, and they had the very famous books.
[00:20:04.678 --> 00:20:06.399]  That show graphic novels.
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:08.820]  Graphic illustrations.
[00:20:10.241 --> 00:20:11.982]  Of adults having sex with Children.
[00:20:12.442 --> 00:20:13.142]  How great it is.
[00:20:15.383 --> 00:20:16.284]  Bob's your neighbor.
[00:20:16.344 --> 00:20:17.144]  Your name's Billy.
[00:20:17.184 --> 00:20:17.664]  You're nine
[00:20:25.376 --> 00:20:34.563]  I mean, I remember just my kids are grown except for one right now, but I remember they were like four or five getting the, you know, the training DVDs that are like.
[00:20:35.224 --> 00:20:41.429]  If a stranger tries to grab by the arm and says, come with them, you drop the ground or run and yell and scream and saying, not my daddy, not my mommy.
[00:20:42.196 --> 00:20:51.739]  And then they have, you know, the videos for kids about if somebody starts touching you, that's not your parents to clean you or a doctor or something, you know, tell an adult, tell your parents.
[00:20:52.239 --> 00:21:00.562]  These are videos how to prime children, literal grooming books and videos they have in the schools and drag queen story time.
[00:21:01.662 --> 00:21:05.723]  It's just absolutely, unspeakably evil.
[00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:08.144]  And it's all out in the open.
[00:21:10.134 --> 00:21:13.777]  Trump blasts Fox News for airing part of Harris's BS Friday night speech.
[00:21:13.837 --> 00:21:15.358]  They shouldn't be allowed to put it on.
[00:21:15.438 --> 00:21:20.161]  So the media is trying to run this idea that Trump wants to censor, that he's the censor.
[00:21:20.722 --> 00:21:22.843]  He'll put everybody in prison when they're the ones actually doing it.
[00:21:23.204 --> 00:21:23.624]  Look at this.
[00:21:24.004 --> 00:21:30.709]  British couple find £3,000, that's like $5,000, after reporting migrant they found in the back of their van.
[00:21:31.009 --> 00:21:31.850]  Well, that'll teach it.
[00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:40.057]  How many more examples does Germany need to see of a failed policy of bringing in the Islamists and all the murder and death?
[00:21:40.077 --> 00:21:41.279]  Well, it's not a failed policy.
[00:21:41.299 --> 00:21:42.179]  It's a design takeover.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.642]  Maybe German politicians can't read a chart.
[00:21:47.124 --> 00:21:49.426]  Well, it's illegal to show these crime statistics in Germany.
[00:21:50.546 --> 00:21:52.887]  Who commits the most crime rapes.
[00:21:53.768 --> 00:21:54.768]  Just in the rape area.
[00:21:55.608 --> 00:21:59.010]  41% of all rapes in Germany are just Afghans alone.
[00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.931]  They're less than 1% of the population.
[00:22:01.951 --> 00:22:02.411]  They're growing.
[00:22:03.132 --> 00:22:03.932]  Africans are 23% of the raping.
[00:22:03.952 --> 00:22:04.312]  Foreigners.
[00:22:04.332 --> 00:22:05.933]  Germans are 0.6 of the rapes.
[00:22:16.345 --> 00:22:21.708]  But in the movies and TV shows, they always show it as an evil, blonde-haired, blue-eyed person doing it.
[00:22:22.188 --> 00:22:23.489]  And as I mentioned, here's the footage.
[00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:24.370]  I'm not going to show it.
[00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.411]  The guy running around starting fires and hacking people up with machetes.
[00:22:28.152 --> 00:22:29.012]  That's just today.
[00:22:30.753 --> 00:22:35.736]  It just goes on and on and on and on.
[00:22:35.856 --> 00:22:38.498]  And the Muslim imams saying, the West belongs to us.
[00:22:38.538 --> 00:22:39.358]  The women belong to us.
[00:22:39.378 --> 00:22:39.879]  We're going to go there.
[00:22:39.899 --> 00:22:40.519]  We're going to take it over.
[00:22:40.539 --> 00:22:41.419]  You know, there's 69 Islamic
[00:22:45.086 --> 00:22:52.070]  Countries in the world, and they don't put up or let Christians or other groups live in peace there.
[00:22:53.751 --> 00:22:56.913]  Some of them, it's completely banned, but others are persecuted.
[00:22:56.933 --> 00:22:58.594]  There's only a few Christians hanging on.
[00:23:00.175 --> 00:23:04.338]  But then when Islam comes here, they act real friendly until they become the majority, and then you're gone.
[00:23:05.619 --> 00:23:06.559]  And that's how this works.
[00:23:06.619 --> 00:23:08.501]  And coming up, they didn't just hire one.
[00:23:08.541 --> 00:23:09.221]  The news is saying one.
[00:23:09.261 --> 00:23:10.102]  It's two this week.
[00:23:11.169 --> 00:23:16.531]  Non citizens from Somalia on the police force in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[00:23:18.992 --> 00:23:22.673]  They're training you that citizens have no rights and foreigners have all the power.
[00:23:22.993 --> 00:23:24.234]  That's totally illegal.
[00:23:25.074 --> 00:23:27.075]  But that is what they are doing.
[00:23:27.695 --> 00:23:29.036]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:23:29.156 --> 00:23:35.038]  Come back with a ton of other breaking news and General Flynn's coming up at about 40 after in studio after we are a special report.
[00:23:37.063 --> 00:23:47.887]  As a lot of you probably heard, as I keep telling you, the federal court has ordered InfoWars sold on the chopping block on November 13th.
[00:23:48.047 --> 00:23:52.088]  And if good patriots buy it, and they don't censor me, and it's a new group, I will work for them.
[00:23:52.688 --> 00:23:54.049]  If not, InfoWars is gone.
[00:23:55.441 --> 00:23:55.601]  Now.
[00:23:56.562 --> 00:23:57.762]  It's great to support InfoWars.
[00:23:57.842 --> 00:23:58.863]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:23:58.903 --> 00:24:00.144]  Vitamineralfusion is amazing.
[00:24:00.164 --> 00:24:02.165]  40% off is the big sell right now.
[00:24:02.285 --> 00:24:06.468]  All the InfoWars MD gummies and CBD that's so good for inflammation and your whole body.
[00:24:06.688 --> 00:24:07.948]  The highest quality, lowest prices.
[00:24:08.048 --> 00:24:09.089]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:16.954]  InfoWars has a sponsor that's keeping us on the air right now and supporting us, but also a sponsor for whatever happens in the future.
[00:24:17.654 --> 00:24:23.478]  And they are also now helping support me and my legal fund to make sure
[00:24:24.574 --> 00:24:32.260]  That they're not able to steal my name or real Alex Jones or try to keep us off the air in the future, which they filed to do saying they own my identity.
[00:24:32.581 --> 00:24:36.304]  You think your new listener that doesn't sound American type in Sandy Hook families.
[00:24:36.324 --> 00:24:38.586]  That means people control the FBI and CIA that ran all this.
[00:24:39.206 --> 00:24:40.988]  Quote one Alex Jones of social media.
[00:24:41.868 --> 00:24:45.351]  Real Alex Jones and they want his name saying they own my name.
[00:24:46.252 --> 00:24:48.174]  The Alex Jones show, so that's a big fight.
[00:24:48.194 --> 00:24:48.714]  I got to do.
[00:24:49.034 --> 00:24:50.596]  We're going to win, but we still got to fight it.
[00:24:52.142 --> 00:24:58.348]  If you want to help me stay on the air one way or another, you support him for wars and you support what I'm going to do going forward.
[00:24:59.389 --> 00:25:01.471]  Helping us gear up behind the scenes.
[00:25:01.691 --> 00:25:04.173]  Regardless, we're not going to miss a lick, but we need your funds.
[00:25:04.233 --> 00:25:07.657]  If you come through and support us, we're going to stay on the air one way or another during this critical time.
[00:25:07.977 --> 00:25:12.321]  And during that right after the election will be more critical than before because Trump gets in, which I think is going to happen.
[00:25:12.782 --> 00:25:13.823]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:25:14.872 --> 00:25:20.315]  And then they're going to go crazy during the 76 days between him being president elect and president.
[00:25:21.215 --> 00:25:22.956]  So it is the bat signal.
[00:25:23.016 --> 00:25:24.097]  It is the action item.
[00:25:24.617 --> 00:25:25.717]  It is what you need to do.
[00:25:26.198 --> 00:25:29.239]  The Alex Jones store dot com and.
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:35.202]  Over 50 amazing Patriot T shirts, the very best designs and ball caps.
[00:25:35.962 --> 00:25:38.904]  And those shirts are very high quality fabric, very high quality
[00:25:42.742 --> 00:25:45.084]  But there is one shirt that isn't $30 or $25 or $35.
[00:25:51.536 --> 00:25:52.677]  We're good to go.
[00:25:52.697 --> 00:25:53.377]  We're good to go.
[00:25:53.397 --> 00:25:53.777]  We're good to go.
[00:25:53.797 --> 00:25:54.377]  We're good to go.
[00:25:54.397 --> 00:25:54.938]  We're good to go.
[00:25:54.958 --> 00:25:55.478]  We're good to go.
[00:25:55.498 --> 00:25:55.878]  We're good to go.
[00:25:55.918 --> 00:25:56.278]  We're good to go.
[00:25:56.318 --> 00:25:56.778]  We're good to go.
[00:25:56.798 --> 00:25:57.419]  We're good to go.
[00:25:57.459 --> 00:25:57.919]  We're good to go.
[00:25:58.519 --> 00:25:58.899]  We're good to go.
[00:25:58.919 --> 00:25:59.319]  We're good to go.
[00:25:59.339 --> 00:25:59.900]  We're good to go.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.380]  We're good to go.
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.120]  We're good to go.
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:01.520]  We're good to go.
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.081]  We're good to go.
[00:26:02.101 --> 00:26:02.801]  We're good to go.
[00:26:02.821 --> 00:26:03.261]  We're good to go.
[00:26:03.321 --> 00:26:03.781]  We're good to go.
[00:26:03.801 --> 00:26:04.322]  We're good to go.
[00:26:04.342 --> 00:26:04.682]  We're good to go.
[00:26:04.702 --> 00:26:05.142]  We're good to go.
[00:26:05.162 --> 00:26:05.562]  We're good to go.
[00:26:05.582 --> 00:26:05.902]  We're good to go.
[00:26:05.922 --> 00:26:06.503]  We're good to go.
[00:26:06.523 --> 00:26:06.843]  We're good to go.
[00:26:06.863 --> 00:26:07.403]  We're good to go.
[00:26:07.423 --> 00:26:08.363]  We're good to go.
[00:26:08.383 --> 00:26:08.824]  We're good to go.
[00:26:08.844 --> 00:26:09.664]  We're good to go.
[00:26:09.684 --> 00:26:10.264]  We're good to go.
[00:26:10.284 --> 00:26:11.145]  We're good to go.
[00:26:11.165 --> 00:26:12.245]  We're good to go.
[00:26:12.265 --> 00:26:12.645]  We're good to go.
[00:26:12.665 --> 00:26:13.065]  We're good to go.
[00:26:13.086 --> 00:26:13.186]  We're
[00:26:14.366 --> 00:26:15.547]  Now is the action time.
[00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:18.129]  Go to the Alex Jones store dot com for all the great designs.
[00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:22.993]  And if you want to really step up to the plate, get the limited edition.
[00:26:23.654 --> 00:26:32.761]  Info Wars shirt, a classic that's been brought back to remember him for wars of its shutdown or to celebrate if it survives, and we don't know it's in your hands.
[00:26:32.821 --> 00:26:33.622]  It's in God's hands.
[00:26:33.822 --> 00:26:34.683]  God works through you.
[00:26:35.263 --> 00:26:37.185]  The Alex Jones store dot com.
[00:26:37.745 --> 00:26:39.086]  The Alex Jones store .com.
[00:26:39.386 --> 00:26:46.671]  And when you go there, you can sign up for free with email to be put on the raffle for the incredible super off road Dodge truck and $10,000 cash on top of it.
[00:26:47.271 --> 00:26:47.691]  A $148,000 value.
[00:26:47.711 --> 00:26:48.212]  The truck's 138,000 plus 10,000.
[00:26:48.252 --> 00:26:48.432]  That's 148,000.
[00:26:48.512 --> 00:26:48.732]  I said, 146,000.
[00:26:48.772 --> 00:26:49.052]  Excuse me.
[00:26:49.072 --> 00:26:50.093]  Uh and then we buy products.
[00:26:50.113 --> 00:26:52.414]  You get entered five to 10 times putting on what you buy into the raffle as well.
[00:26:52.434 --> 00:26:53.855]  That's all the Alex Jones store .com.
[00:26:53.875 --> 00:26:54.435]  But it is an action item.
[00:27:06.943 --> 00:27:12.808]  Save the Alex Jones broadcast t-shirt and remember in full wars one way or another we've done incredible things together.
[00:27:12.828 --> 00:27:14.530]  Thank you all for your support to alexjonestore.com.
[00:27:19.534 --> 00:27:22.396]  You know I'm beyond enraged right now.
[00:27:23.792 --> 00:27:25.133]  I'm like a Tasmanian devil.
[00:27:25.993 --> 00:27:29.895]  You cannot cut the suspense and the danger and the history that's happening right now.
[00:27:30.596 --> 00:27:31.776]  So much good is happening.
[00:27:31.816 --> 00:27:32.977]  So much bad is happening.
[00:27:33.397 --> 00:27:40.481]  Our country is openly under globalist attack, but they're also getting their asses kicked politically everywhere, and the awakening is so huge!
[00:27:41.321 --> 00:27:46.464]  And a lot of people are starting to wake up, but if they knew how serious it was, they would be acting just like me.
[00:27:47.264 --> 00:27:49.325]  I mean, this is do or die time.
[00:27:49.445 --> 00:27:50.586]  Zero hour right now.
[00:27:52.427 --> 00:27:52.667]  All right.
[00:27:53.609 --> 00:28:14.761]  We're going to go to break in the middle of the segment here in a few minutes and bring in General Flynn, who I just can't wait to talk to about the state of the world and what he thinks the enemy's going to do and the Trump assassination attempts and all the wars and Zelensky and the open border and just all the craziness that's happening right now and the fact that our enemies are falling on their face everywhere, which is great, except then what do they do when that happens?
[00:28:14.781 --> 00:28:17.042]  They false flag, they escalate, they cyber attack.
[00:28:17.062 --> 00:28:18.403]  I mean, you can feel the danger.
[00:28:19.725 --> 00:28:20.806]  And it doesn't scare me.
[00:28:20.846 --> 00:28:24.370]  It makes me just absolutely go wild wanting to beat these people.
[00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:25.951]  But we've got to be smart about it.
[00:28:26.672 --> 00:28:29.715]  We've also got to realize how urgent the situation is every day.
[00:28:29.755 --> 00:28:34.079]  This isn't like, oh, it's a show or Trump's just another guy running for office.
[00:28:34.119 --> 00:28:39.103]  We're in the most important time in human history so far, in my view, since Christ walked the earth.
[00:28:39.524 --> 00:28:41.486]  That's the only other time as important as this one.
[00:28:42.572 --> 00:28:45.073]  And it's a time of great change.
[00:28:45.453 --> 00:28:48.233]  And evil knows that and is trying to make their move.
[00:28:48.914 --> 00:28:50.934]  You know, Trump last night made a great point.
[00:28:50.994 --> 00:28:51.294]  It's true.
[00:28:51.334 --> 00:28:53.695]  The media is attacking him because they're idiots and they hate him.
[00:28:53.735 --> 00:28:54.135]  It's true.
[00:28:54.675 --> 00:28:56.155]  Biden is completely out of his mind.
[00:28:56.275 --> 00:28:58.496]  And Harris has always been a mental midget.
[00:28:59.476 --> 00:29:02.157]  But we have to understand that's because they're puppets of the system.
[00:29:02.177 --> 00:29:02.657]  Here's the clip.
[00:29:04.977 --> 00:29:07.478]  Kamala is mentally impaired.
[00:29:08.238 --> 00:29:11.059]  Every Republican did what she did.
[00:29:18.701 --> 00:29:28.383]  If a Republican did what she did, that Republican would be impeached and removed from office, and rightfully so, for high crimes and misdemeanors.
[00:29:28.423 --> 00:29:30.944]  That would be high crimes and misdemeanors.
[00:29:31.784 --> 00:29:33.484]  Think of it.
[00:29:33.504 --> 00:29:38.306]  13,099 murderers, convicted of murder, not like convicted of murder.
[00:29:38.666 --> 00:29:39.766]  Some of the worst murders
[00:29:40.984 --> 00:29:43.425]  You've ever seen, they're all in our country now, every one of them.
[00:29:43.906 --> 00:29:47.928]  And I've been saying this for three years, and the fake news has been saying, well, you don't know that.
[00:29:47.948 --> 00:29:48.748]  Well, now we know it.
[00:29:49.429 --> 00:29:51.190]  They've never released a list like this.
[00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.131]  Not just on this, they've never done it.
[00:29:53.451 --> 00:29:54.812]  Over the years, they've never done it.
[00:29:55.793 --> 00:30:08.500]  She let in, and that's not even mentioning the rapists, the gang members, the drug dealers, the child predators, and the traffickers in women.
[00:30:09.815 --> 00:30:10.936]  In women, mostly women.
[00:30:11.416 --> 00:30:13.398]  Joe Biden became mentally impaired.
[00:30:13.858 --> 00:30:16.180]  Kamala was born that way.
[00:30:19.462 --> 00:30:30.090]  She was born that way.
[00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:36.154]  And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country.
[00:30:37.742 --> 00:30:38.723]  They did it on purpose.
[00:30:38.983 --> 00:30:46.187]  You see all these headlines about how, oh, Germany and Europe bringing in tens of millions of Muslims really failed.
[00:30:46.207 --> 00:30:48.429]  It was always their plan to break down society.
[00:30:48.909 --> 00:30:49.910]  They're at war with us.
[00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:51.351]  But I want to say something very clearly here.
[00:30:53.172 --> 00:30:57.355]  I am very honored and blessed to have been born in this time, and so, in my view, were you.
[00:30:58.749 --> 00:31:07.334]  And God put us here in this time and place so that we could change the world and out of all this terrible garbage that's happening, be even better.
[00:31:08.435 --> 00:31:11.857]  And it is just like Newtonian physics.
[00:31:12.057 --> 00:31:14.038]  For every action, there's an opposite-equal reaction.
[00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:21.343]  Every time I see the horrors and the tyranny and the corruption on display, that's there to try to break our will and demoralize us.
[00:31:21.383 --> 00:31:21.923]  We can't do that.
[00:31:21.943 --> 00:31:26.206]  We have to understand that there is the opposite of that incredible good happening as well.
[00:31:27.328 --> 00:31:30.891]  And I try to spend more time here on the show focusing on that.
[00:31:30.951 --> 00:31:38.278]  You know, there's a video that's up on my ex channel on Real Alex Jones that I'll try to get to later and over an hour after Flynn leaves us.
[00:31:39.719 --> 00:31:48.787]  Where one of these YouTubers goes out and wears the other team's jersey and walks around a campus and people are trying to beat him up.
[00:31:49.693 --> 00:31:53.936]  How stupid is that over a soccer team or a football team or a basketball team?
[00:31:54.576 --> 00:31:55.577]  But that's tribalism.
[00:31:55.597 --> 00:32:00.200]  People have been trained to only care about their team when that doesn't matter, unless you're on the team.
[00:32:01.101 --> 00:32:02.802]  And still, you don't beat somebody up over it.
[00:32:02.882 --> 00:32:03.542]  It's just a team.
[00:32:03.863 --> 00:32:04.803]  Where's the sportsmanship?
[00:32:06.464 --> 00:32:16.031]  People are supposed to get tribally upset about losing their country, their sovereignty, about wars being started that can kill us all, like we see happening right now.
[00:32:18.032 --> 00:32:18.713]  All over the planet.
[00:32:19.953 --> 00:32:26.138]  And that's what the Romans did to control their population was bread and circuses.
[00:32:27.739 --> 00:32:32.783]  So, I mean, I really wish that these young people, particularly,
[00:32:34.028 --> 00:32:38.530]  Could just sit back and be asked the question and listeners can do this because I'm sure you have family there like this.
[00:32:39.751 --> 00:32:43.032]  And say, Why do you get depressed for a week of your football team loses?
[00:32:43.633 --> 00:32:44.713]  Or why are you euphoric?
[00:32:45.373 --> 00:32:48.755]  When you're living vicariously through something else that doesn't matter if your team
[00:32:53.604 --> 00:33:04.652]  But when 325,000 children are smuggled in with the federal government's help and disappear into slave labor and sex slavery, and the government covers it up, God sees that.
[00:33:06.794 --> 00:33:08.655]  And then our children will be next.
[00:33:08.715 --> 00:33:12.978]  I mean, can't people get upset about things that really matter?
[00:33:12.998 --> 00:33:14.299]  People think, man, Jones is weird.
[00:33:14.539 --> 00:33:20.784]  He gets so upset about them trying to take our guns or killing nine-month-old babies and partial-birth abortion.
[00:33:22.489 --> 00:33:24.432]  Or hundreds of thousands of fentanyl deaths a year.
[00:33:24.993 --> 00:33:30.623]  But then if I yelled and screamed and painted myself all different colors and got drunk, it'd be, oh, he's a good American.
[00:33:30.663 --> 00:33:31.865]  He really cares about his team.
[00:33:31.965 --> 00:33:32.426]  Atta boy!
[00:33:32.446 --> 00:33:34.189]  No, that's not wholesome.
[00:33:34.489 --> 00:33:35.310]  That's sick.
[00:33:37.179 --> 00:33:39.042]  People all the time ask me, Hey, come over and watch the game.
[00:33:39.803 --> 00:33:42.026]  And it's just like I used to be in the football.
[00:33:42.046 --> 00:33:44.189]  I understand a good football game is fun.
[00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:50.538]  But when your country is literally being destroyed in front of you, I can't do it.
[00:33:51.219 --> 00:33:53.042]  And I know we all need rest and relaxation, but
[00:33:53.919 --> 00:33:54.679]  Things are out of balance.
[00:33:55.319 --> 00:33:57.320]  I'm not knocking you to go play golf or go bowl.
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.520]  I do that every once in a while.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:33:59.640]  Go fishing.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.241]  It's all great.
[00:34:00.361 --> 00:34:06.422]  But if it's your God, if it's the God you put before God, who's the real God, that's a false idol.
[00:34:06.802 --> 00:34:08.783]  And that's what happens when you worship crap.
[00:34:08.963 --> 00:34:11.503]  People are like, why are the Israelites worshiping a golden cow?
[00:34:11.523 --> 00:34:12.124]  That's stupid.
[00:34:12.284 --> 00:34:14.004]  Well, why are you worshiping LeBron James?
[00:34:14.404 --> 00:34:16.925]  It's a communist Chinese pimp on the payroll.
[00:34:17.925 --> 00:34:18.125]  All right.
[00:34:18.145 --> 00:34:21.066]  I'm going to settle down because Flynn's calm guy and only have a lot to say.
[00:34:21.106 --> 00:34:25.608]  And we're really blessed to have the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and former top national security advisor Trump.
[00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:32.771]  The deep state fears so much to kind of lay out the roadmap 36 days out for the most important election in world history.
[00:34:32.791 --> 00:34:32.771]  36, 37.
[00:34:34.713 --> 00:34:35.713]  At midnight tonight, it'll be 36.
[00:34:36.053 --> 00:34:38.594]  So we're going to go to break here real quick.
[00:34:39.134 --> 00:34:44.036]  Tell everybody, you know, tune in, repost and retweet at Real Alex Jones.
[00:34:44.536 --> 00:34:47.216]  Infowars.com forward slash show band dot video.
[00:34:47.977 --> 00:34:50.037]  And that's how we reach tens of millions of more people.
[00:34:50.717 --> 00:34:53.278]  And that's why I salute you all as the modern Paul Revere's.
[00:34:53.598 --> 00:34:56.619]  We'll be right back with General Flynn in studio.
[00:34:57.745 --> 00:35:06.457]  I got a great way for you to keep InfoWars on the air, and regardless of what happens, InfoWars keep me on the air, and that's thealexjonestore.com, a new key URL for you to mark down.
[00:35:06.918 --> 00:35:10.222]  I've teamed up with the folks that make a lot of the top-selling Trump shirts in the country.
[00:35:10.263 --> 00:35:12.085]  They've got the best t-shirt designers, Bigley.
[00:35:12.426 --> 00:35:14.468]  If you go to thealexjonestore.com,
[00:35:15.069 --> 00:35:16.170]  That's separate from InfoWars.
[00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:17.051]  That's key to support.
[00:35:17.191 --> 00:35:19.193]  Into the future, whatever happens here.
[00:35:19.213 --> 00:35:21.395]  30-plus amazing new t-shirt designs.
[00:35:21.655 --> 00:35:22.896]  New ones being added every day.
[00:35:23.276 --> 00:35:23.937]  They're incredible.
[00:35:24.197 --> 00:35:24.857]  Trump shirts.
[00:35:25.058 --> 00:35:25.558]  You name it.
[00:35:25.898 --> 00:35:27.680]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:34.426]  And every time you buy a shirt or 30-plus different great designs of Patriot ball caps, you get entered five or 10 times, depending on the day.
[00:35:34.466 --> 00:35:35.166]  It's different every day.
[00:35:35.567 --> 00:35:37.728]  Into the raffle to get $10,000 cash.
[00:35:38.229 --> 00:35:40.491]  Halloween's when the prize is announced, the winner.
[00:35:42.312 --> 00:35:53.141]  And a $138,000 turbo diesel super deluxe off road upgraded the best truck you can get over the top turbo diesel engine, A E V standard features, and then it's all upgraded.
[00:35:53.161 --> 00:35:54.662]  I tried to go over, take an hour.
[00:35:54.942 --> 00:35:57.465]  The best tires, the best shocks, the best systems.
[00:35:57.805 --> 00:36:02.689]  It's a 2024 Ram Prospector A E V Dodge turbo diesel.
[00:36:03.249 --> 00:36:04.069]  We're good to go.

[00:39:14.145 --> 00:39:15.605]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:39:28.332 --> 00:39:34.275]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:39:34.735 --> 00:39:51.423]  Alright, for the next hour and 15 minutes in studio, a great American, General Michael Flynn, GeneralFlynn.com, and of course, FlynnMovie.com.
[00:39:51.443 --> 00:39:52.083]  What an incredible
[00:39:53.463 --> 00:40:02.966]  Yeah, it's great to be back.
[00:40:03.026 --> 00:40:07.087]  I love I love being in studio with you, Alex, and thank you for what you're doing.
[00:40:07.107 --> 00:40:11.769]  I mean, fighting the good fight is this is a war that we are in, and I want people to understand that.
[00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:17.613]  Well, I just want to say you're always very calm, which I know is a very good leadership quality.
[00:40:18.353 --> 00:40:19.894]  I'm calm when I'm getting ready for the show.
[00:40:19.914 --> 00:40:27.099]  But when I finally get up here and John Kerry saying overthrow the First Amendment, Hillary saying and they're passing laws in California, the evil is so out in the open.
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:31.022]  Just just the magnitude of the moment history were in.
[00:40:32.671 --> 00:40:37.898]  I want the general viewer listener, but also the general public to understand the urgency.
[00:40:38.458 --> 00:40:47.450]  Can you just give us a 35,000 foot view of 37 days from the election, the Trump assassination attempts, all of it, for the moment in history we're in?
[00:40:48.072 --> 00:40:51.235]  Yeah, so this is the most consequential moment in United States history.
[00:40:51.275 --> 00:40:56.200]  We're kind of in, I call it the third arc of history, the first one being the American Revolution, the second one being the Civil War.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:12.535]  And then this is the moment where kind of the left, in this case, this communist movement that has risen in our country for at least the last 50 years, if not the last 100, has made the decision, and they really made it when they put Barack Obama in place,
[00:41:13.215 --> 00:41:16.377]  And the heir apparent to Barack was going to be Hillary Clinton.
[00:41:16.397 --> 00:41:18.078]  Of course, Donald Trump got in the way.
[00:41:18.858 --> 00:41:25.081]  And so when he got in the way, like, all bets were off as far as they were concerned.
[00:41:25.121 --> 00:41:27.822]  They decided then this will never happen again.
[00:41:27.842 --> 00:41:32.925]  And we are now in the throes of essentially a takeover of our government.
[00:41:32.965 --> 00:41:35.726]  And I do go back to the 5th of January.
[00:41:35.746 --> 00:41:36.747]  I always bring this date up.
[00:41:36.907 --> 00:41:38.027]  5th of January, 2017, in the Oval Office.
[00:41:39.628 --> 00:41:48.099]  Where Barack Obama, with all of his henchmen, Biden was in there with him, and Comey, Clapper, you know, all the likely suspects, Brennan, Rice, Sally Yates, they were all there.
[00:41:48.119 --> 00:41:50.562]  5 January 2017, it's been documented.
[00:41:51.303 --> 00:41:55.207]  And that's when they decided, basically, we gotta take out Trump.
[00:41:56.008 --> 00:42:01.270]  And when they decided to do that, you know, now you fast forward, right?
[00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:03.070]  So everybody knows all the background.
[00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:06.872]  You've been covering this, you know, really, really well over the last number of years.
[00:42:07.232 --> 00:42:10.913]  But now we're at a place where they're now trying to physically kill him.
[00:42:11.353 --> 00:42:16.975]  So these latest assassination attempts, this is not Iran that was trying to kill Donald Trump.
[00:42:16.995 --> 00:42:22.097]  These are actually people who are on, at least one of them on the FBI's radar, probably both.
[00:42:23.117 --> 00:42:34.788]  One of them clearly should have been, and my analysis is, was, and this is the second shooter, was on the CIA's radar, particularly with what he was doing over in Ukraine.
[00:42:35.188 --> 00:42:38.391]  We should expect to see another assassination attempt.
[00:42:38.471 --> 00:42:43.255]  There's all these reports about Iran after, you know, going after Donald Trump with these missiles and such.
[00:42:43.295 --> 00:42:45.537]  But I think that some of that is a deception.
[00:42:45.577 --> 00:42:48.140]  So I want people to understand that this is
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.543]  This is the period in U.S.
[00:42:50.563 --> 00:43:00.778]  history where the left, the Marxist left, has decided we are not going to allow Donald Trump, we're not going to allow for a fair election, we're not going to allow Donald Trump to come back into office.
[00:43:01.119 --> 00:43:03.482]  So they're going to do everything that they can to take him out.
[00:43:04.964 --> 00:43:06.666]  And we're in the throes of this.
[00:43:06.726 --> 00:43:24.120]  I mean, when you see what's happening in the Middle East, when you see what's happening in Eastern Europe, I mean, all this stuff that's going on in the Middle East, we don't even hear the things that are going on in Eastern Europe, and yet we're allowing ATACMS, which is a very sophisticated weapons system, which we're training the Ukrainian military on.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.582]  We probably have contract workers there, U.S.
[00:43:27.022 --> 00:43:30.265]  contract workers there in Ukraine that are helping to fire these systems.
[00:43:30.665 --> 00:43:31.406]  I mean, these people
[00:43:31.986 --> 00:43:36.147]  These people will accept a nuclear attack.
[00:43:36.207 --> 00:43:40.928]  They will accept a nuclear engagement in order to keep Donald Trump out of the White House.
[00:43:41.269 --> 00:43:49.431]  I mean, we are in a period where we're going to see such a level of desperation in these next 37 days, and I want people to understand that.
[00:43:50.091 --> 00:44:01.204]  What you think you have been through already, you know, the last eight years, what we are about to experience in these next couple of weeks, this next month plus, I think that it's going to blow the minds of people.
[00:44:01.224 --> 00:44:05.910]  I mean, I think we're going to see some things that we have not experienced as a nation.
[00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:07.531]  And as you said earlier,
[00:44:08.192 --> 00:44:22.220]  I actually feel very blessed to be alive right now because, I mean, I have studied our country, I have studied our founders, I've studied the warfare, the wars that we have been in, and I look at things and I say, God, you know, we're actually, we're in the lead here.
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:23.961]  We have the momentum on our side.
[00:44:24.021 --> 00:44:27.042]  We have the mass of people on our side.
[00:44:27.082 --> 00:44:27.683]  We have the
[00:44:28.223 --> 00:44:29.904]  You know, the majority on our side.
[00:44:30.005 --> 00:44:37.631]  All we have to do is make the decision to get out of the bleachers, get onto the field, folks, and leave it all on the field in these next 37 days.
[00:44:38.011 --> 00:44:45.818]  Do not leave yourself with any excuses on the 6th of November by saying, well, I would have, should have, could have done something else.
[00:44:46.298 --> 00:44:49.921]  You do it now and do it for the next 37 days as hard as you can.
[00:44:50.262 --> 00:44:54.946]  That's why I'm out here in studio with Alex, because I'm traveling again around this country
[00:44:55.746 --> 00:45:05.469]  Basically, with the same message, to get people fired up, to get people inspired, to give people hope, and to make sure that the American people understand that we are in a war right now.
[00:45:05.509 --> 00:45:10.331]  This is an intellectual, physical, emotional, and definitely a spiritual war.
[00:45:10.811 --> 00:45:17.814]  And I appreciate the fact that you, Alex, always bring the idea of faith back into this, because I think that people have to have faith in each other.
[00:45:18.514 --> 00:45:21.075]  We are facing a dark, soulless,
[00:45:21.955 --> 00:45:24.435]  A group of people, Marxists, that have no soul.
[00:45:24.856 --> 00:45:50.240]  They are dark-hearted, and their idea about the way the United States of America should be is without a constitution, you know, total control of the Supreme Court, total control of our lives, you know, own nothing, be happy, as Klaus Schwab has stated many times and written about in his book, The Great Reset, which I hate to even talk about it, but I want people to understand
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.321]  You have to understand your enemy.
[00:45:52.361 --> 00:45:53.741]  You have to read their doctrine.
[00:45:53.761 --> 00:45:55.242]  You have to listen to what they say.
[00:45:55.902 --> 00:46:09.927]  And the fact that I'm sitting here and understanding what our enemy is trying to do, because when I say our enemy, you know, I hate to say that about somebody who is an American serving in our government, but these people are enemies of America.
[00:46:10.127 --> 00:46:11.128]  They've hijacked the country.
[00:46:11.148 --> 00:46:13.589]  It'd be like if you're on a plane and hijackers take over.
[00:46:14.409 --> 00:46:16.911]  They can put the uniform of the captain, but they're not the captain.
[00:46:17.171 --> 00:46:18.632]  Right, right, General.
[00:46:18.672 --> 00:46:20.953]  You're on fire, and I want to just try to give you the floor.
[00:46:21.013 --> 00:46:23.615]  I'm serious, but I want to go back to where you started.
[00:46:23.675 --> 00:46:25.216]  That's what's so important.
[00:46:25.236 --> 00:46:31.419]  The way you lay this out because any real general or historian gives people the compendium to understand where they are now and then where they're going.
[00:46:31.459 --> 00:46:33.441]  That's the key to know history, so you don't repeat it.
[00:46:34.554 --> 00:46:42.438]  They targeted you, day one, as the number one threat, and Trump's even come out and said this in speeches years ago and recently, he didn't know what he was doing.
[00:46:43.199 --> 00:46:58.768]  And they brought him all these think tanks, these so-called Republican groups, and they recommended all these other neocons that were actually agents against him and others, and you were one of the only people, in fact, the only one in a major leadership position, a cabinet-level position,
[00:46:59.588 --> 00:47:02.430]  As the National Security Advisor, day one, they had the meeting.
[00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:03.371]  It's been declassified.
[00:47:03.391 --> 00:47:05.273]  It's been released years after they persecuted you.
[00:47:05.293 --> 00:47:06.994]  You were, of course, exonerated.
[00:47:07.975 --> 00:47:15.201]  They sent the FBI in to set you up and to lie, to stop you because you could help him bring in good people.
[00:47:15.441 --> 00:47:15.801]  We're good to go.
[00:47:37.628 --> 00:47:41.052]  Got the nomination in Cleveland to start spying on him.
[00:47:41.072 --> 00:47:42.013]  Crossfire Hurricane.
[00:47:42.634 --> 00:47:43.635]  Then he wins.
[00:47:43.695 --> 00:47:44.877]  Then you get in with him.
[00:47:45.678 --> 00:47:46.979]  They say, Okay, now he's in.
[00:47:47.039 --> 00:47:47.740]  Take him out.
[00:47:48.361 --> 00:47:48.941]  That's come out.
[00:47:49.001 --> 00:47:53.667]  Congress is all admitted people that said documented his whole history out there for new viewer and then.
[00:47:54.668 --> 00:48:08.960]  They fail through all the fake impeachments and all the Russiagate 1.0, 2.0, all of it, and then all the lawfare, and then the criminal indictments, and then the fake convictions, and then one assassination attempt, and then two, and now more that they say have gone on we don't know about.
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:16.186]  We're following this trajectory of total escalation, and as you said on the cover story of Iran, surface-to-air missiles,
[00:48:16.866 --> 00:48:18.707]  I mean, this is danger zone.
[00:48:18.727 --> 00:48:26.451]  So when I say my skin's crawling, I intellectually look at this, coldly studying and researching and listening to experts like you.
[00:48:26.471 --> 00:48:31.754]  And then when I get on air, it takes emotion to get people fired up, but I'm naturally that way.
[00:48:31.774 --> 00:48:36.377]  I just, you said it, this is the most consequential existential moment.
[00:48:36.437 --> 00:48:37.478]  I've been around 50 years.
[00:48:39.096 --> 00:48:41.478]  I'm having I wouldn't call it anxiety.
[00:48:41.518 --> 00:48:42.119]  It's the opposite.
[00:48:42.499 --> 00:48:49.745]  I've got 10 times the spider sense and energy right now to try to fight this to the point of it's like it's too much because
[00:48:50.942 --> 00:48:54.586]  At a spiritual level, but also at an intellectual level, I know this is the war.
[00:48:54.706 --> 00:48:55.547]  This is the big one.
[00:48:55.787 --> 00:48:59.411]  I know I'm ranting, but that's a lot I just said.
[00:48:59.471 --> 00:49:09.442]  This is a time that people like you, people like me, and many, many other people that are out there, and I know that you tell this to your audience all the time, this is, you know, you're blessed to be alive right now.
[00:49:09.782 --> 00:49:11.224]  I mean, we can do this.
[00:49:11.684 --> 00:49:14.066]  You know, and I'll just kind of go to another level here.
[00:49:14.246 --> 00:49:19.791]  When we think about the United States of America going through, you know, really consequential moments, right?
[00:49:20.132 --> 00:49:21.493]  And this is the third one.
[00:49:21.513 --> 00:49:25.957]  So the very first one was the Revolutionary War, the American Revolution.
[00:49:26.297 --> 00:49:31.041]  We had George Washington as the leader and, of course, our founders, and they created this beautiful country.
[00:49:31.081 --> 00:49:31.762]  The second one
[00:49:32.262 --> 00:49:34.283]  Now we're going through this third arc of US history
[00:49:54.915 --> 00:50:02.160]  You know, we had World War I, World War II, all these wars of the last century, but they weren't really existential threats to our country.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:03.961]  This time is.
[00:50:04.021 --> 00:50:05.482]  This third arc of U.S.
[00:50:05.522 --> 00:50:12.687]  history, the challenge that we have, that we face right now, is that we don't have that leader that we need in charge, right?
[00:50:13.047 --> 00:50:17.490]  We have Donald Trump, who is running for office, and they're doing everything that Alice just laid out.
[00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:20.492]  I mean, to the point of trying to kill this man.
[00:50:20.612 --> 00:50:24.035]  I mean, it's no longer maybe conspiracy theory.
[00:50:24.456 --> 00:50:28.799]  It's already happened twice, where the first one they tried to turn his head into red mist.
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:32.403]  So I want people to understand this arc that we are in.
[00:50:32.883 --> 00:50:33.864]  So who's in charge?
[00:50:33.904 --> 00:50:34.765]  Who's on our side?
[00:50:35.065 --> 00:50:36.926]  Who can we count on?
[00:50:37.367 --> 00:50:40.389]  We should now count on what the founders told us, which is ourselves.
[00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:41.090]  We the people.
[00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:45.294]  So this is a moment where the American people are going to have to stand up.
[00:50:45.774 --> 00:50:49.036]  You know, step up, speak up, and sound off.
[00:50:49.116 --> 00:50:57.602]  Do not allow—you know, this is kind of a cease and desist order that Trump put out a couple of weeks ago when he posted it, and I liked it.
[00:50:57.642 --> 00:50:59.323]  I appreciated the fact that he said that.
[00:50:59.863 --> 00:51:04.987]  What we want to do is we want to tell people in our local level—I always use the phrase, local action has a national impact.
[00:51:05.007 --> 00:51:05.947]  General, we've got to break.
[00:51:05.987 --> 00:51:06.648]  Satellites fire.
[00:51:07.308 --> 00:51:09.869]  And I said I'm not going to interrupt because I want to hear everything you say.
[00:51:09.889 --> 00:51:15.011]  I'm going to come back when you start over, go through it all, lay it out and just basically host the next hour.
[00:51:15.071 --> 00:51:17.492]  I'm going to sit over here and put a tennis ball in my mouth.
[00:51:17.993 --> 00:51:20.113]  And some stations don't carry the first five.
[00:51:20.134 --> 00:51:24.075]  So I'm going to air a promo for your film and other stuff for the next five minutes because I don't want anybody to miss this.
[00:51:24.415 --> 00:51:25.936]  We come back in at six after.
[00:51:26.316 --> 00:51:28.137]  I'm going to just sit over here and you're going to have the floor, sir.
[00:51:28.577 --> 00:51:32.619]  We're getting a briefing from the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency on the state of our republic.
[00:51:32.639 --> 00:51:34.400]  You're not going to get better information anywhere.
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:35.340]  General Flynn
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:47.264]  GeneralFlynn.com, stay with us.
[00:51:49.644 --> 00:51:53.025]  Flynn knew exactly how the system worked.
[00:51:53.085 --> 00:51:55.626]  He knew exactly what the intel world had been up to.
[00:51:55.686 --> 00:51:57.187]  He understood its funding.
[00:52:00.308 --> 00:52:01.108]  They had to get rid of Flynn.
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:08.683]  President's former National Security Advisor, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn pleaded guilty today to lying to the FBI.
[00:52:08.964 --> 00:52:11.705]  There was a moment where I just felt like I was drowning.
[00:52:11.765 --> 00:52:21.811]  We all knew that he was one of the most respected generals in the military.
[00:52:21.851 --> 00:52:23.332]  Plain and simple.
[00:52:33.973 --> 00:52:39.256]  Well, in 2012 he was appointed Director of Defense Intelligence Agency.
[00:52:39.276 --> 00:52:45.338]  He ordered the first audit of the use of DIA's use of contractors.
[00:52:46.139 --> 00:52:48.260]  This set off alarm bells.
[00:52:50.307 --> 00:52:52.569]  So I'm in there with these other political appointees.
[00:52:52.829 --> 00:52:55.871]  They're all supposed to go in there and tell what they believe to be the truth.
[00:52:56.111 --> 00:53:01.174]  What they did was they took my assessment and they wanted me to change it.
[00:53:01.194 --> 00:53:02.775]  I was like, I'm not changing it.
[00:53:03.276 --> 00:53:09.160]  Mike Flynn, whatever you think of him or his politics, did not lie, but instead told the truth.
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:16.024]  And so he was, by definition, the most dangerous possible person for Donald Trump to hire.
[00:53:16.545 --> 00:53:19.707]  President Obama said, but I do have one specific recommendation.
[00:53:20.627 --> 00:53:21.868]  Stay away from Michael Flynn.
[00:53:22.748 --> 00:53:23.548]  He's bad news.
[00:53:28.531 --> 00:53:30.892]  I went into the service because I love our country.
[00:53:31.252 --> 00:53:38.975]  And I come home and I find out that the worst enemy that I'm going to face in my life is right here in America.
[00:53:42.065 --> 00:53:49.988]  Even had he not served this country, even if he were not a combat veteran, to turn something like this loose on a family?
[00:53:50.308 --> 00:53:51.228]  I mean, it's monstrous.
[00:53:51.489 --> 00:53:54.630]  The media was out there in droves.
[00:53:56.050 --> 00:54:03.053]  I went into a very deep depression, like suicidal depression.
[00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:05.874]  The only thing that kept me alive was my son.
[00:54:07.515 --> 00:54:17.958]  We always knew that we somehow had to get through it because we knew we were guilty.
[00:54:17.978 --> 00:54:23.659]  Over time, instead of being pounded down below the surface of the ocean, we started to fight.
[00:54:24.399 --> 00:54:26.200]  I'm now above the surface.
[00:54:32.141 --> 00:54:33.421]  But I can see the shoreline.
[00:54:34.722 --> 00:54:36.182]  And I started to swim for it.
[00:54:48.283 --> 00:54:59.216]  One of the things that I would recommend for people to go look at, and I don't care what you think about this guy who I'm about to mention, but I was sent a video yesterday.
[00:54:59.637 --> 00:55:04.402]  It's basically a documentary, and late in the afternoon, so I watched it last night.
[00:55:05.023 --> 00:55:08.264]  And it's by Alex Jones, Info Wars.
[00:55:08.684 --> 00:55:14.827]  And the media has tarnished him with all sorts of name-calling, conspiracy theorists, bomb thrower.
[00:55:15.287 --> 00:55:20.749]  The one thing that I know about this gentleman, Alex Jones, is that he loves this country.
[00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:22.770]  He is as smart as a whip.
[00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:30.692]  He absolutely believes in what he believes in, and he also does his research and his homework.
[00:55:31.252 --> 00:55:35.553]  And so I sat, because a close friend of mine said, you've got to watch this.
[00:55:35.613 --> 00:55:36.793]  I just finished watching it.
[00:55:37.313 --> 00:55:45.095]  He actually put it out yesterday, and it's called An Emergency Broadcast, and it's based on InfoWars, and it's based on the whole COVID lie.
[00:55:46.455 --> 00:55:52.677]  And Alex takes his audience through an hour and a half worth of just incredible level of detail.
[00:55:53.357 --> 00:56:18.331]  of a of a war game that our government did back in the 2016-2017 time frame with with you know under a different name and they called it SPARS instead of SARS COVID right and it's this incredible runs parallel to everything that's going on today even in the war game that they did almost five years ago now four years ago now
[00:56:19.031 --> 00:56:23.213]  In the war game, they even put out social media things like tweets and such.
[00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:30.697]  And in the tweets that they use in the war game, they use the exact same tweets over the last year.
[00:56:30.837 --> 00:56:33.479]  I mean, the exact same words, the exact same hashtags.
[00:56:33.919 --> 00:56:35.560]  And it's like, it's one big setup.
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:44.945]  So let me, so that's just this thing that this thing that Alex Jones put out yesterday, it needs to get out in a bigger way because Alex walks through
[00:56:45.845 --> 00:56:48.027]  And again, whatever, I don't care what people think of him.
[00:56:48.127 --> 00:56:50.849]  He's incredibly detailed in his research.
[00:56:51.229 --> 00:56:52.350]  He loves this country.
[00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:53.390]  He is a patriot.
[00:56:53.711 --> 00:56:57.914]  And he's somebody who we better listen to, or others in this country better listen to.
[00:56:57.954 --> 00:57:08.681]  And there's a reason why the mainstream media calls a guy like him a bomb thrower or a conspiracy theorist, because they're in fear of the truth that he does actually bring out.
[00:57:08.841 --> 00:57:13.505]  And in this particular documentary that he did yesterday, it's fascinating.
[00:57:14.125 --> 00:57:21.650]  And it there's an awful, awful lot of parallels in it from what was done in a war game, so to speak, quote unquote.
[00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:24.412]  And then what we what the reality is that we're facing.
[00:57:26.933 --> 00:57:28.995]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:57:31.316 --> 00:57:36.960]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:54.886]  People say, Where are the generals who in the past like Eisenhower and many others stood up against the military industrial complex in the deep state?
[00:57:56.027 --> 00:57:58.588]  Where are the people that will do that?
[00:57:58.668 --> 00:58:04.773]  And well, most of them in compromising globalist, but General Flynn, one of those respected generals in modern history, did not do that.
[00:58:05.253 --> 00:58:08.896]  And he's with us in studio General Flynn dot com Flynn movie dot com.
[00:58:09.656 --> 00:58:11.477]  You definitely got to visit that and check the film out.
[00:58:11.537 --> 00:58:12.117]  It's incredible.
[00:58:12.558 --> 00:58:19.022]  Also his books on what's currently happening, understanding fifth generational warfare or beyond critical General Flynn dot com.
[00:58:19.422 --> 00:58:19.602]  All right.
[00:58:19.682 --> 00:58:21.763]  He was here for only 15 minutes at the end of the hour.
[00:58:21.783 --> 00:58:27.967]  I want him to recap what existential means, and I know most of you know that we literally have hundreds of thousands of listeners a day.
[00:58:28.447 --> 00:58:30.328]  Existential means life threatening.
[00:58:30.408 --> 00:58:34.351]  America is in a do or die battle for its existence.
[00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:37.753]  Existential means a battle of life and death.
[00:58:38.593 --> 00:58:43.154]  And there are powerful corporate interests, BlackRock's public now, that want to get rid of sovereignty.
[00:58:43.534 --> 00:58:46.335]  They don't want America to be there anymore because it's an example of freedom.
[00:58:46.635 --> 00:58:52.456]  They want to control us and have this new leftist world government, ESG, social credit score system.
[00:58:52.996 --> 00:58:55.717]  And they tried to steal the election in 2016.
[00:58:56.077 --> 00:58:57.177]  They tried to impeach Trump.
[00:58:57.197 --> 00:58:58.197]  They tried to put him in prison.
[00:58:58.857 --> 00:59:00.998]  They only made him more popular, so now they tried to kill him twice.
[00:59:01.798 --> 00:59:04.045]  And they stood down, and you've got this U.S.
[00:59:04.105 --> 00:59:08.820]  fighter, two Ukraine CIA connections, whistleblowers from the Secret Service saying...
[00:59:10.373 --> 00:59:12.054]  To the Senate that no, they stood down.
[00:59:12.074 --> 00:59:14.214]  These are service agents that work there.
[00:59:14.815 --> 00:59:16.055]  So now we know where we are.
[00:59:16.075 --> 00:59:17.296]  Where are they going to go next?
[00:59:17.316 --> 00:59:25.999]  But to understand that and to lay out the moment with 37 days left of what they're going to do and what we should do at this moment.
[00:59:26.019 --> 00:59:28.600]  And he said last hour, and I agree with him, we have the initiative.
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:29.660]  We're turning the tide.
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:32.321]  Populists and anti-globalists are winning everywhere.
[00:59:32.961 --> 00:59:34.082]  It's now household name.
[00:59:34.122 --> 00:59:34.703]  New World Order.
[00:59:34.743 --> 00:59:35.544]  Klaus Schwab.
[00:59:35.944 --> 00:59:36.805]  David Rockefeller.
[00:59:36.865 --> 00:59:39.748]  This was stuff that most people didn't know 10, 20, 30 years ago.
[00:59:40.248 --> 00:59:42.430]  So the Sleeping Giants awake.
[00:59:43.359 --> 00:59:44.760]  But now it's got to take action.
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:47.581]  So General Flynn for the rest of the hour will be basically hosting.
[00:59:47.621 --> 00:59:48.601]  I'll just take us in on a break.
[00:59:48.641 --> 00:59:49.861]  General Flynn, please start over.
[00:59:50.101 --> 00:59:51.202]  We're going to erupt in and continue.
[00:59:51.222 --> 00:59:52.062]  That's great.
[00:59:52.422 --> 00:59:53.983]  You know, so where are the generals?
[00:59:54.003 --> 00:59:55.063]  Let me answer that question.
[00:59:55.103 --> 00:59:56.144]  You're one of the generals.
[00:59:56.764 --> 01:00:00.765]  I'm one of the generals guys got, you know, we have people like Tucker Carlson out there.
[01:00:00.805 --> 01:00:02.966]  We have other big voices that are out there.
[01:00:04.387 --> 01:00:05.247]  Owen is another one.
[01:00:05.287 --> 01:00:10.349]  I mean, we have people that are standing up and speaking out existential.
[01:00:11.169 --> 01:00:12.250]  What existential means?
[01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:14.632]  It means the end of the republic, okay?
[01:00:14.672 --> 01:00:15.392]  That's what it means.
[01:00:15.452 --> 01:00:18.955]  It means the end of the republic as we know it, right?
[01:00:19.455 --> 01:00:22.338]  As Benjamin Franklin said, if you can keep it, right?
[01:00:22.978 --> 01:00:27.762]  So we are in a time frame right now, historically,
[01:00:28.442 --> 01:00:40.545]  When I laid out earlier, you know, prior to the break, I laid out these kind of arcs of history because, you know, every nation-state, you know, fact of life is that all nation-states end up coming to their end, right?
[01:00:40.585 --> 01:00:47.867]  I mean, there's no more Roman Empire, there's no more British Empire, there's no more Ottoman Empire, you know, Corinthians, Byzantine, I could go on and on.
[01:00:49.011 --> 01:00:51.352]  So when is ours going to come to an end?
[01:00:52.012 --> 01:00:53.092]  And that's a fact.
[01:00:53.252 --> 01:00:55.053]  It is a fact of human history.
[01:00:55.433 --> 01:00:56.813]  So where are we at right now?
[01:00:56.893 --> 01:01:12.338]  And where I believe we're at, we're at one of these moments in time, and this is the time right now where there has been a creeping of globalists in our system, in our body, in the body of the American public that has crept into
[01:01:13.238 --> 01:01:28.712]  Uh, what has amounted to one of the political parties, and that was the Democratic Party, and everybody, I think, believes and knows that back around the 1960 Great Society timeframe when Johnson was the president, that was when they decided we're going to basically capture one party, and they did.
[01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:41.359]  And now it's taken about 50 years to get here, and they've made certain decisions post the, really, the Clintons in the 90s, you know, the Bush-Gore debate in 2000, right?
[01:01:41.379 --> 01:01:42.259]  Everybody remembers that.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:46.181]  These people constantly learn lessons.
[01:01:46.261 --> 01:01:50.144]  They tried it again in the 2016 time frame.
[01:01:50.164 --> 01:01:51.004]  It didn't work for them.
[01:01:51.484 --> 01:01:52.205]  Trump gets in.
[01:01:52.305 --> 01:01:57.968]  So I jumped ahead of a lot of things there, but we are in a period of time where
[01:01:58.528 --> 01:02:03.012]  You know, there is a momentum that we currently have, and I can see this.
[01:02:03.673 --> 01:02:05.074]  I mean, I think Alex sees this.
[01:02:05.494 --> 01:02:08.217]  Many of the listeners probably see it, but may not.
[01:02:08.237 --> 01:02:20.468]  I mean, I feel like we have the momentum right now because every time we see some type of action on their part, they try to kill Trump, they try to impeach him, they try to Russiagate, they try to throw him in jail.
[01:02:21.048 --> 01:02:23.730]  Every single time that there's an action, there is a reaction.
[01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:27.292]  And frankly, the reaction is the American people aren't falling for it again.
[01:02:27.773 --> 01:02:29.334]  Okay, the old fool me once, right?
[01:02:29.814 --> 01:02:30.474]  Shame on you.
[01:02:30.554 --> 01:02:40.601]  So now we're at a place in our time where we have an opportunity to really get control of this country as we've always believed we the people.
[01:02:41.001 --> 01:02:41.582]  And I think that
[01:02:42.242 --> 01:02:51.104]  If we do the kinds of things that I know the American people are fully capable of doing, going out there, and the biggest thing is, it's a warning from me.
[01:02:51.124 --> 01:02:58.166]  A warning from me to anybody who is considering or being asked to undermine our elections.
[01:02:58.486 --> 01:03:00.107]  And I don't care which party you're part of.
[01:03:00.147 --> 01:03:01.307]  I don't care what side you're on.
[01:03:01.807 --> 01:03:11.634]  If you think that you're going to be part of this establishment crowd that's going to continue to take this country down this, this path towards communism, I'm telling you, it's just not going to work.
[01:03:11.974 --> 01:03:14.456]  There are tens of millions of Americans.
[01:03:14.936 --> 01:03:22.381]  One of the things that I want people to understand is it's like on the battlefield, you know, you got to have these incremental victories and we are having them left and right.
[01:03:22.821 --> 01:03:26.103]  We constantly are winning different little brush fire wars.
[01:03:26.524 --> 01:03:27.484]  We have been blessed.
[01:03:27.644 --> 01:03:31.347]  We have been blessed because, and there have been miracles and Trump knows this.
[01:03:31.827 --> 01:03:41.096]  I mean, the miracle of him surviving that first assassination attempt, you know, and then all of a sudden there's another one, and you kind of go, wait a second, what the hell's going on here?
[01:03:41.537 --> 01:03:50.906]  And I, you know, guarantee that there's going to be something else that's going to take place that's going to cause all of us to kind of go, to reel back and go, okay, enough is enough.
[01:03:51.366 --> 01:03:58.390]  So what we've got to do as Americans is we've got to be demanding, we've got to be questioning every single government official at our local level.
[01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:07.796]  We cannot go into this election blind and think that our vote on Election Day is going to count without being actively involved.
[01:04:08.496 --> 01:04:11.018]  And that's just what's going on right here.
[01:04:11.398 --> 01:04:27.410]  I mean, if we, God forbid, if Kamala Harris, and I wrote down a list of items here just on the break, the kind of things, if Kamala Harris becomes President of the United States, just off the top of my head, the filibuster's going to be abolished, that's a big deal.
[01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:29.051]  I don't know.
[01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:44.411]  We're good to go.
[01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:15.050]  It's unreal.
[01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:17.471]  It's like the Bolshevik Revolution all over again.
[01:05:17.931 --> 01:05:20.172]  They will de-platform people.
[01:05:20.192 --> 01:05:29.354]  I mean, they've already done this to many of us out here, and we've been able to fight and get ourselves back on solely because of you, because the people are demanding truth.
[01:05:29.714 --> 01:05:35.296]  But they wanted to establish, under this Biden-Harris administration, a ministry of truth, so to speak.
[01:05:35.836 --> 01:05:38.378]  You know, they call it the Disinformation Governance Board.
[01:05:38.838 --> 01:05:40.259]  Disinformation Governance Board.
[01:05:40.279 --> 01:05:48.245]  So, the people of this country went ballistic on their members of Congress, and they were able to quash that.
[01:05:48.385 --> 01:05:53.889]  All they did was they kept it in play, they just renamed it, and it's still there.
[01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:59.173]  If she wins, we're going to see the truth, the Department of Truth,
[01:05:59.713 --> 01:06:01.035]  And it's going to be their truth.
[01:06:01.475 --> 01:06:16.652]  Churches and religious institutions, for all the Christians out there that didn't vote in 2020, and the number's like 30 or 40 million, somewhere between 30 and 40 million Christians who are registered to vote, who can vote, but did not vote.
[01:06:17.293 --> 01:06:26.055]  You cannot, if you're looking for perfection in the president of the United States, like to be your priest or pastor, you're in the wrong place.
[01:06:26.495 --> 01:06:27.635]  We need leadership.
[01:06:27.655 --> 01:06:31.216]  We need strong leadership who are bold and willing to do the things.
[01:06:31.276 --> 01:06:36.597]  And this is a guy, in Trump's case, who's already proven himself as a president.
[01:06:36.617 --> 01:06:39.317]  So he's already done an amazing set of things.
[01:06:39.817 --> 01:06:41.738]  And I'm sitting here as a guy who
[01:06:42.598 --> 01:06:47.500]  He basically dismissed, after only a couple of weeks, I could sit here and be his worst enemy.
[01:06:47.961 --> 01:06:55.624]  But I'm not, because I know this man, and I know his character, and I know the type of, I know the love that he has for this country, but also his skill.
[01:06:56.064 --> 01:07:00.566]  His skill to be able to do the kinds of things that we need to have done now.
[01:07:01.847 --> 01:07:06.789]  And Trump has admitted, and he admitted it to me as well, he didn't know the ways of Washington, D.C.
[01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.570]  He didn't know how
[01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:10.951]  You know, all this machinations of D.C.
[01:07:10.991 --> 01:07:11.211]  work.
[01:07:11.451 --> 01:07:12.891]  And frankly, that's why we voted for him.
[01:07:12.911 --> 01:07:15.511]  That's why we made him the president in 2016.
[01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:22.553]  Because we didn't want this stale political establishment type, whether it was Republican or Democrat.
[01:07:22.573 --> 01:07:23.553]  We didn't want it anymore.
[01:07:23.933 --> 01:07:29.074]  So, as we go into this next election here, 37 days from now, Trump knows.
[01:07:29.514 --> 01:07:33.535]  He knows exactly the type of people, he knows exactly the type of things that he needs to do.
[01:07:34.315 --> 01:07:37.577]  And like he says, you know, we're going to measure ourselves by the success.
[01:07:37.597 --> 01:07:41.439]  We're going to stop these wars because I want to talk about these wars going on right now.
[01:07:41.939 --> 01:07:54.666]  Between now and Election Day, we're going to see we're going to see an increase in the kinds of things that are happening in the Middle East and, uh, and in Europe because it is an opportunity for them to basically make some decisions.
[01:07:54.726 --> 01:07:58.348]  If they feel they can't win this election, they'll declare some sort of national emergency.
[01:07:58.368 --> 01:08:02.170]  And by the way, a year ago and again six months ago, you literally predicted all of that.
[01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:03.130]  Yep.
[01:08:03.550 --> 01:08:07.652]  So, you know, then the other crazy stuff, right?
[01:08:07.732 --> 01:08:10.353]  Boys showering in girls' locker rooms.
[01:08:10.893 --> 01:08:17.455]  And one of the things I wrote down is teaching kids, I mean, teaching kids that they've been born in the wrong bodies.
[01:08:18.035 --> 01:08:23.097]  The things that I just mentioned, that litany of things, as well as the open border madness that we're going through.
[01:08:23.777 --> 01:08:29.503]  The things that I just mentioned, those are all things that Kamala Harris has stated.
[01:08:29.623 --> 01:08:40.054]  So I'm taking things that she has said, that she believes in, and there's a whole litany of other, I mean it could be another dozen things that I talk about, that she has actually said.
[01:08:40.495 --> 01:08:41.115]  So we can't
[01:08:41.696 --> 01:08:49.259]  All of a sudden fall into this trap and now I'm reaching out to those people that I know watch this show that are on the independent side.
[01:08:49.579 --> 01:08:50.739]  I'm a former Democrat.
[01:08:50.879 --> 01:08:56.061]  I come from the school of the Kennedy Democrat world.
[01:08:56.442 --> 01:09:04.705]  I'm a former Democrat who actually was looked at by Donald Trump in the summer of 2016 as a Democrat to be Vice President of the United States.
[01:09:04.745 --> 01:09:05.485]  How about that, folks?
[01:09:05.845 --> 01:09:08.707]  Me, Newt Gingrich, Chris Christie, Mike Pence.
[01:09:08.927 --> 01:09:11.209]  Mike Pence and all of them.
[01:09:11.289 --> 01:09:15.392]  I mean, it's just unbelievable, you know, where these people are at right now.
[01:09:15.412 --> 01:09:19.795]  I still am a fan of Newt Gingrich, but the other two I have no time for.
[01:09:20.155 --> 01:09:32.763]  Mike Pence is one of these people in the establishment that came in with Trump, was given to Trump, this is the guy that you're going to need because Pence was there to kind of temper Trump, right?
[01:09:33.184 --> 01:09:34.845]  To try to temper this lion.
[01:09:35.405 --> 01:09:38.426]  And this lion said, No, this is how things are going to be.
[01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:39.006]  But he got in.
[01:09:39.106 --> 01:09:40.067]  He got in my way.
[01:09:40.427 --> 01:09:43.428]  You know, obviously, vice president and decisions were made.
[01:09:43.848 --> 01:09:44.929]  And I I did.
[01:09:45.069 --> 01:09:47.630]  I believe the right thing at that moment in time.
[01:09:47.690 --> 01:09:50.651]  So that's a that's a story for another day.
[01:09:50.991 --> 01:09:56.133]  But when I talk about actions and reactions and counteractions, that's called war gaming.
[01:09:56.433 --> 01:10:02.515]  So when I as I look at as I look at the world and I look at scenarios, I look at at options.
[01:10:02.535 --> 01:10:04.576]  You know, the one thing that I always say about warfare.
[01:10:05.336 --> 01:10:09.179]  In warfare, you have to have the most options right up until the last possible minute.
[01:10:09.839 --> 01:10:19.146]  So, I know, as I contemplate the kinds of things that these people are considering, the type of scenarios that they are considering, right?
[01:10:19.867 --> 01:10:21.728]  A scenario where they just take it all.
[01:10:22.129 --> 01:10:30.435]  They take the presidency, they take the House, they take the Senate, they look at the down ballots, they look at a couple of other governorships maybe that are in play.
[01:10:30.455 --> 01:10:31.716]  And by the way, just to interrupt me briefly,
[01:10:32.642 --> 01:10:37.428]  Driving in today with you on the show that was supposed to be the headline for the show, and I forgot to post that.
[01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:43.915]  And you General Flynn to war game, the deep state's next moves and how we can stop them.
[01:10:43.935 --> 01:10:44.937]  And you thank God that me.
[01:10:45.337 --> 01:10:46.158]  I forgot about you.
[01:10:46.178 --> 01:10:46.839]  This is wargaming.
[01:10:47.219 --> 01:10:50.764]  How critical in politics and business in war wargaming is
[01:10:51.124 --> 01:10:51.565]  So much of it.
[01:10:51.585 --> 01:10:52.045]  It's everything.
[01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:53.267]  It's everything.
[01:10:53.287 --> 01:10:56.651]  You know, I mean, the whole idea about planning, you know, you got to plan, plan, plan, plan.
[01:10:56.791 --> 01:10:59.855]  And then once the first shot is fired, you know, all plans go to hell.
[01:10:59.895 --> 01:11:02.058]  But as long as you have thought through these things.
[01:11:02.078 --> 01:11:03.139]  You looked at all the angles.
[01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:03.680]  Exactly.
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:07.405]  So I, you know, a little, you know, 30 seconds on my background.
[01:11:07.765 --> 01:11:16.750]  My background is a person who, primarily in the intelligence world, where I always had to put my feet into the boots of our enemy and think like them.
[01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:22.933]  So that means I had to study their doctrine, I had to study their formations, I had to study their strengths, their weaknesses, all these different things.
[01:11:23.253 --> 01:11:28.696]  Because when I came in front of our commanders, in front of the commanders that I worked for over the years,
[01:11:29.076 --> 01:11:31.398]  You know, they were going to ask me, well, what is the enemy thinking?
[01:11:31.478 --> 01:11:32.499]  What is the enemy going to do?
[01:11:32.519 --> 01:11:33.040]  What are they going to do?
[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:35.762]  Because we have to plan our strategy around it, right?
[01:11:36.122 --> 01:11:39.445]  So I always tell people, if I can think it, they can think it.
[01:11:39.525 --> 01:11:47.052]  And they have people on their team that are very, that are smart, shrewd, savvy, they're strategic, and they are evil.
[01:11:47.592 --> 01:11:51.055]  And they don't have a moral high ground that conservatives have.
[01:11:51.556 --> 01:11:53.678]  And that's why they do things and you say to yourself,
[01:11:54.258 --> 01:11:55.758]  What the hell is going on here?
[01:11:55.798 --> 01:11:56.699]  Why are these people doing it?
[01:11:56.919 --> 01:11:58.679]  Why are they trying to kill this man, right?
[01:11:59.039 --> 01:12:00.480]  Why are they burning down cities?
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:02.540]  Why are they attacking statues?
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:03.741]  Why are they ripping statues?
[01:12:03.761 --> 01:12:05.321]  Why are they ripping our country apart?
[01:12:05.661 --> 01:12:11.863]  Why are they flying another flag on a government facility other than the American flag?
[01:12:11.883 --> 01:12:14.504]  I mean, all these things are happening and you say to yourself, wow.
[01:12:14.964 --> 01:12:20.466]  So as I sit here today and I think through the scenarios that we could see, so if it's Kamala,
[01:12:21.266 --> 01:12:28.953]  You know, the House, the Senate, you know, then you know that they have gone for the entire enchilada, so to speak.
[01:12:28.993 --> 01:12:31.915]  They've just decided, we're done, we're going to take it all.
[01:12:32.076 --> 01:12:32.996]  One-party system.
[01:12:33.257 --> 01:12:34.117]  One-party system.
[01:12:34.137 --> 01:12:39.102]  They don't care about what I call plausible deniability, because that's the second scenario.
[01:12:39.122 --> 01:12:47.049]  So the plausible deniability is a really, you know, as the media is doing, the media is doing this very strategically, it's very intentional.
[01:12:47.649 --> 01:12:51.312]  They're keeping the race close.
[01:12:51.332 --> 01:12:55.095]  They're going, well, the polls are here and there, but they're keeping the race close.
[01:12:55.155 --> 01:13:05.063]  As long as they can keep it in the mind of the American people and enough of the American people where, well, it's a close race, they're neck and neck going into Election Day.
[01:13:05.103 --> 01:13:06.244]  They can sell the steel.
[01:13:06.304 --> 01:13:07.124]  They can sell it.
[01:13:07.765 --> 01:13:13.129]  And how they'll do it is they'll give President Trump some states, right?
[01:13:13.149 --> 01:13:14.971]  They'll say, because remember, 270 electoral votes.
[01:13:16.952 --> 01:13:18.713]  So all you gotta do is have 270, right?
[01:13:19.073 --> 01:13:27.859]  So there's a plausible deniability scenario where Kamala ends up with 272 and Trump ends up with, I think it's 266.
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.801]  And everybody's gonna go, what the hell, what happened?
[01:13:30.821 --> 01:13:35.104]  And it all was close, the media's gonna jump on it, their corporate media, their cable media.
[01:13:35.124 --> 01:13:36.025]  Just like they did last time.
[01:13:36.045 --> 01:13:40.448]  And they're gonna go, well, it was a close race, it's been close, it was close the whole way in.
[01:13:40.688 --> 01:13:41.448]  It's not close.
[01:13:41.769 --> 01:13:42.609]  It is not close.
[01:13:42.969 --> 01:13:44.731]  Polls are meant to influence.
[01:13:45.131 --> 01:13:46.592]  Polls are like propaganda.
[01:13:47.172 --> 01:13:47.452]  Okay?
[01:13:47.792 --> 01:13:50.253]  Now, everybody's gonna go, well, this poll, that poll.
[01:13:50.954 --> 01:13:53.655]  The polls in 2020 had Donald Trump up.
[01:13:53.895 --> 01:13:58.637]  The rallies in 2020, 40,000, 50,000 people at his rallies.
[01:13:59.097 --> 01:14:04.140]  Joe Biden couldn't get, you know, a half a dozen people into white circles in somebody's backyard.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:04.720]  Yet,
[01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:06.521]  He gets 81 million votes.
[01:14:06.841 --> 01:14:09.182]  So plausible deniability is a scenario.
[01:14:09.202 --> 01:14:18.928]  And I use that phrase, plausible deniability, very precisely because it is where they can say, well, look, it was close the whole way into the 5th of November.
[01:14:19.528 --> 01:14:23.330]  And in this case, the American people, they didn't want Donald Trump anymore.
[01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:24.231]  And it was close.
[01:14:24.271 --> 01:14:25.071]  And so she wins.
[01:14:25.411 --> 01:14:28.053]  And what does that mean in that particular scenario?
[01:14:28.513 --> 01:14:29.573]  So what do they give him?
[01:14:29.613 --> 01:14:34.195]  Because they got to give him something to make it look like it was real, right?
[01:14:34.535 --> 01:14:36.535]  So maybe they give him some key states.
[01:14:36.915 --> 01:14:40.016]  Maybe they give him like a Pennsylvania, but they take North Carolina.
[01:14:40.436 --> 01:14:43.637]  Maybe they give him a Georgia, but they take Arizona and Wisconsin.
[01:14:43.917 --> 01:14:48.919]  So there's a, there is a, uh, a set of factors when you really analyze this.
[01:14:48.959 --> 01:14:53.720]  And I've done this with some really bright people to war game these various scenarios.
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.460]  They tell you what they're going to do by their pre-programming.
[01:14:55.621 --> 01:14:56.181]  Exactly.
[01:14:56.261 --> 01:14:56.781]  So again,
[01:14:57.481 --> 01:15:05.064]  The fact that I'm sitting here on Alex Jones' show telling you about these types of things, that means that they can also think it.
[01:15:05.104 --> 01:15:13.267]  And they're going to think through, you know, so many iterations of so many scenarios to make it appear as though we can actually win.
[01:15:13.287 --> 01:15:13.827]  So what do we do?
[01:15:14.107 --> 01:15:16.448]  And we can convince enough people in this country
[01:15:17.068 --> 01:15:20.391]  That it worked that that you know, she's actually who we want.
[01:15:20.971 --> 01:15:25.014]  So the other scenario, the other sort of big scenario is Trump wins.
[01:15:25.674 --> 01:15:26.795]  Okay, so Trump wins.
[01:15:27.216 --> 01:15:35.542]  And I always go back to and I and I started thinking about this after I heard Jamie Raskin out of I think Raskin's out of Maryland, civil war conditions.
[01:15:35.822 --> 01:15:42.745]  So when I heard Jamie Raskin give this thing a couple of weeks ago, and he says, well, if Trump wins, we are not going to certify the election.
[01:15:42.805 --> 01:15:43.786]  I said, OK.
[01:15:44.086 --> 01:15:45.606]  So that's another scenario.
[01:15:46.027 --> 01:15:52.289]  So they're already projecting some of the things that they're going to do, or that they are planning to do.
[01:15:52.429 --> 01:15:53.350]  When he's president-elect.
[01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:54.891]  So people, you've got to listen.
[01:15:54.911 --> 01:16:01.834]  You can listen to this show, because Alex is going to cover, he covers a breadth of stuff on a show like this.
[01:16:02.734 --> 01:16:04.935]  I watch the enemy, right?
[01:16:04.955 --> 01:16:09.456]  Just like I studied our enemy's doctrine on the foreign battlefields around the world here.
[01:16:09.976 --> 01:16:13.717]  I watch CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC.
[01:16:14.037 --> 01:16:16.918]  I read their online documents.
[01:16:16.998 --> 01:16:22.699]  I read some of the left-leaning authors that are out there that are talking about some of this stuff.
[01:16:23.039 --> 01:16:30.541]  So they're telling us, like they always do, they're telling us the kinds of scenarios, the kinds of options that they are considering right now.
[01:16:31.221 --> 01:16:41.534]  And what they do is they project them into the teams that are surrounding the strategic planning cell of the left.
[01:16:42.054 --> 01:16:44.918]  This is what's going on right now.
[01:16:45.278 --> 01:16:50.284]  And I want people to understand that, because I want to jump to the wars here, because these are part of the
[01:16:50.905 --> 01:16:57.027]  The sort of the push the way that they leverage international developments.
[01:16:57.247 --> 01:16:58.847]  In general, I want to go there, but you've got the floor.
[01:16:59.287 --> 01:17:00.167]  This is fascinating.
[01:17:00.187 --> 01:17:01.328]  You're absolutely right.
[01:17:01.628 --> 01:17:04.469]  I try to do wide spectrum, a lot of topics, people get general info.
[01:17:04.869 --> 01:17:05.729]  That's why you're here.
[01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.609]  You're right.
[01:17:06.649 --> 01:17:09.530]  Strategically, those last three scenarios
[01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:13.292]  We need to laser in on those because last time I could tell what they were going to do.
[01:17:13.332 --> 01:17:17.074]  I called it the 79 days of hell when he would become elect versus sworn in.
[01:17:17.134 --> 01:17:19.596]  It's 76 this time on the calendar.
[01:17:20.196 --> 01:17:24.859]  Bloomberg came out and they all said, and then John Podesta was in the New York Times war game.
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:26.961]  And they said, let him look like he wins.
[01:17:27.621 --> 01:17:29.822]  We'll have enough mail in balance no matter what.
[01:17:29.842 --> 01:17:31.383]  We're going to call it a red mirage.
[01:17:31.844 --> 01:17:34.926]  And they basically admitted they were going to steal it in their own publications.
[01:17:35.586 --> 01:17:37.291]  And then that's indeed what they did.
[01:17:37.632 --> 01:17:42.245]  They telegraphed to their own people and they're telegraphing different scenarios now.
[01:17:42.706 --> 01:17:43.388]  So we know.
[01:17:44.873 --> 01:17:49.998]  Which plays they may do, because they always have plan A, B, C, maybe even D. So we know their playbook.
[01:17:50.038 --> 01:17:52.039]  We just don't know what play they're going to run.
[01:17:52.059 --> 01:17:57.144]  But right after the day, they'll start initiating, depending on the scenarios, which one they're going to do.
[01:17:57.484 --> 01:18:00.727]  So that's literally, people ask how I know the future, how you know the future.
[01:18:00.987 --> 01:18:02.649]  No, we're just watching the enemy's movements.
[01:18:02.809 --> 01:18:03.269]  Exactly.
[01:18:03.449 --> 01:18:07.413]  And you know, I mean, so a lot of people out there right now, and you ought to be asking this question, so what?
[01:18:07.873 --> 01:18:11.594]  I mean, you know, are we ready for all of these scenarios?
[01:18:11.634 --> 01:18:13.935]  Do we have a counter strategy?
[01:18:13.975 --> 01:18:16.576]  Do we have a counter action to these strategies?
[01:18:16.636 --> 01:18:26.859]  And part of it is, you know, these people that are around President Trump right now and the team of people that I know that they are looking and considering all of these options.
[01:18:27.359 --> 01:18:32.661]  One of the challenges that we do have is the left is so well organized.
[01:18:32.681 --> 01:18:33.721]  I mean, they are organized.
[01:18:33.741 --> 01:18:36.002]  They say, this is the direction we're going to take.
[01:18:36.502 --> 01:18:41.925]  That's the direction that they take, where we have too often too many debates internally.
[01:18:42.345 --> 01:18:51.410]  And so one of the things that we do have, thank God, and he's alive still, is Donald Trump, who is just such an enormous historic figure.
[01:18:52.751 --> 01:18:57.635]  You know, we have had people we have had leaders come, you know, come throughout our the history of our country.
[01:18:57.695 --> 01:18:59.976]  These and the great captains throughout history.
[01:19:00.437 --> 01:19:02.258]  This is a guy like him or not folks.
[01:19:02.598 --> 01:19:08.223]  This is a guy that was put in for such a time as this and thank God that
[01:19:08.843 --> 01:19:20.473]  There's divine intervention in his life that has kept him alive and given him the energy to be able to do the things that he needs to still do because this is extraordinary pressure.
[01:19:20.493 --> 01:19:22.815]  This is extraordinarily hard work.
[01:19:22.835 --> 01:19:22.815]  78.
[01:19:23.375 --> 01:19:23.856]  Exactly.
[01:19:24.096 --> 01:19:26.419]  I mean, but he operates as a much younger guy.
[01:19:26.459 --> 01:19:33.627]  And I always remind people that this man was an athlete, never touched cigarettes, never touched alcohol, and both of his parents lived into their 90s.
[01:19:33.647 --> 01:19:37.532]  So this is not a guy that's going to, you know, like a wallflower, he's just going to waste away.
[01:19:37.552 --> 01:19:38.833]  There's no way in the world.
[01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:41.156]  This is a tough, tough, tough man.
[01:19:41.216 --> 01:19:42.578]  So a couple of things.
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.922]  So I laid out a couple of the scenarios.
[01:19:46.942 --> 01:19:47.222]  Stay there.
[01:19:47.242 --> 01:19:48.023]  We got one more break.
[01:19:48.343 --> 01:19:53.407]  And by the way, I'm not going to twist your arm, but I'm going for two hours after you leave, and it's actually basically commercial free.
[01:19:53.427 --> 01:19:54.428]  There's only like one break an hour.
[01:19:54.728 --> 01:19:56.369]  You can do a little bit more in the next hour on other topics.
[01:19:56.389 --> 01:19:57.530]  You can do it if you got to go understand.
[01:19:57.971 --> 01:19:59.192]  But General Flynn dot com.
[01:19:59.212 --> 01:20:01.413]  You've got to see the film Flynn movie dot com.
[01:20:01.433 --> 01:20:08.339]  We're back in just a few minutes with General Flynn because you could not get better Intel only 37 days out.
[01:20:08.499 --> 01:20:10.501]  You can cut the suspense with a knife.
[01:20:11.081 --> 01:20:15.930]  And I would just add, pray, pray, pray for peace, pray for Trump, pray for America, pray for a win.
[01:20:19.608 --> 01:20:41.643]  And folks, you're getting the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, one of the top strategists on record in his career at the Pentagon, predicting so much of what happened while he was there, and after the former National Security Advisor to President Trump, Michael Flynn, briefing you, the millions that are watching, and if you all share this live feed and then share the archive once it's at Rail Alex Jones tonight and Bandot Video and InfoWars, we'll reach millions more.
[01:20:41.683 --> 01:20:43.965]  It's up to you, as the Paul Reveres,
[01:20:44.625 --> 01:20:45.866]  To carry the ball here.
[01:20:46.026 --> 01:20:49.708]  America is facing a death battle, a fight for its very life.
[01:20:50.269 --> 01:20:52.390]  And it's not like some foreign cultures coming in.
[01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.931]  It's better.
[01:20:53.531 --> 01:20:56.653]  You know, you know, the Romans or something trying to take over Germany or Germania.
[01:20:57.073 --> 01:21:01.696]  This, and I'm not saying it's better overall, but you know, aqueducts, medicine, you know, things like that.
[01:21:02.417 --> 01:21:08.161]  This is a tyrannical, anti-human, satanic, new world order system that people now realize.
[01:21:08.301 --> 01:21:10.002]  I wasn't just calling it satanic 30 years ago.
[01:21:10.662 --> 01:21:11.503]  It really is.
[01:21:11.523 --> 01:21:13.905]  Uh, so you got interrupted by the break, sir.
[01:21:13.965 --> 01:21:14.465]  Please continue.
[01:21:14.905 --> 01:21:36.356]  Yeah, I mean, you know, this is really important and people can go back and look this up You know post-world war one is when the new world order that phrase came into vogue So this is this goes back over a hundred years The development of that idea and that strategy to get to where we are now, you know post-world war two I mean go look it up in the congressional record.
[01:21:36.396 --> 01:21:37.016]  I think there's 44 or 45
[01:21:38.717 --> 01:21:43.080]  You know, stages of things that the communists wanted to do to be able to take over our country.
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:50.064]  So all of these things, when you start to look at them over time, we are now here, okay?
[01:21:50.484 --> 01:21:57.289]  And I think that I tell people, because I'm going to talk about something called declared national emergencies here in a second.
[01:21:57.409 --> 01:21:59.190]  Most people don't even know what these things are.
[01:21:59.210 --> 01:22:00.331]  And COG.
[01:22:00.511 --> 01:22:00.751]  Right.
[01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:03.993]  So, yeah, continuity of government, continuity of operations.
[01:22:04.033 --> 01:22:06.214]  So, you know, I will just say that
[01:22:07.495 --> 01:22:30.285]  The majority of American people, you know, we're kind of to blame a little bit here, folks, because we've just sort of become complacent and lazy over the last, let's just say, 30, 40 years, where we just kind of, you know, we allow these politicians to go back into office, they come back, they tell us all these lies, we give them a little bit of money, and they go back in, and we just go about our business, you know, trying to live the lives that we want to live.
[01:22:30.865 --> 01:22:45.176]  And what has happened is they have progressively been consumed by this evil that does exist principally in Washington, D.C., but it has permeated down into the bowels of really even local levels.
[01:22:45.236 --> 01:22:46.597]  And everybody knows what I'm talking about.
[01:22:46.617 --> 01:22:48.338]  People see it in their own local governments.
[01:22:48.778 --> 01:22:52.141]  You know, district attorneys that people like George Soros has gotten behind.
[01:22:52.321 --> 01:22:53.081]  We're good to go.
[01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:53.621]  We're good to go.
[01:22:53.642 --> 01:22:54.082]  We're good to go.
[01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:54.502]  We're good to go.
[01:22:54.522 --> 01:22:54.902]  We're good to go.
[01:22:54.922 --> 01:22:55.762]  We're good to go.
[01:22:55.782 --> 01:22:56.863]  We're good to go.
[01:22:57.063 --> 01:22:57.563]  We're good to go.
[01:22:57.583 --> 01:22:58.103]  We're good to go.
[01:22:58.163 --> 01:22:58.623]  We're good to go.
[01:22:58.823 --> 01:22:59.264]  We're good to go.
[01:22:59.284 --> 01:22:59.664]  We're good to go.
[01:22:59.684 --> 01:23:00.024]  We're good to go.
[01:23:00.044 --> 01:23:00.464]  We're good to go.
[01:23:00.484 --> 01:23:01.004]  We're good to go.
[01:23:01.024 --> 01:23:01.364]  We're good to go.
[01:23:01.404 --> 01:23:02.045]  We're good to go.
[01:23:02.065 --> 01:23:02.465]  We're good to go.
[01:23:02.485 --> 01:23:03.425]  We're good to go.
[01:23:03.485 --> 01:23:04.325]  We're good to go.
[01:23:04.345 --> 01:23:05.066]  We're good to go.
[01:23:05.086 --> 01:23:05.706]  We're good to go.
[01:23:05.726 --> 01:23:06.166]  We're good to go.
[01:23:06.266 --> 01:23:06.646]  We're good to go.
[01:23:06.706 --> 01:23:07.447]  We're good to go.
[01:23:07.487 --> 01:23:08.087]  We're good to go.
[01:23:08.207 --> 01:23:09.247]  We're good to go.
[01:23:09.287 --> 01:23:09.647]  We're good to go.
[01:23:09.667 --> 01:23:10.187]  We're good to go.
[01:23:10.228 --> 01:23:10.848]  We're good to go.
[01:23:10.888 --> 01:23:11.408]  We're good to go.
[01:23:11.428 --> 01:23:12.108]  We're good to go.
[01:23:12.128 --> 01:23:12.748]  We're good to go.
[01:23:12.808 --> 01:23:13.909]  We're good to go.
[01:23:13.969 --> 01:23:14.969]  We're good to go.
[01:23:15.009 --> 01:23:15.629]  We're good to go.
[01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:16.130]  We're good to go.
[01:23:16.150 --> 01:23:16.270]  We're
[01:23:17.210 --> 01:23:20.572]  So there's something called Declared National Emergencies.
[01:23:20.672 --> 01:23:22.093]  Declared National Emergencies.
[01:23:22.653 --> 01:23:27.395]  And if I was to ask you, you know, do we have any Declared National Emergencies in this country right now?
[01:23:27.915 --> 01:23:29.896]  Most people would go, I don't know, go right over your heads.
[01:23:30.377 --> 01:23:31.017]  We actually have 43.
[01:23:33.078 --> 01:23:44.285]  So, 43 current declared national emergencies that are on the books, and a President of the United States can enact any one of them.
[01:23:44.345 --> 01:23:52.309]  Now, some of them are for countries that are, you know, like Iran, as an example, or Russia, or China.
[01:23:52.569 --> 01:23:58.833]  There's declared national emergencies in case of, you know, the glass needs to be broken because of something that they did.
[01:23:59.273 --> 01:24:04.519]  But there are about a third of these declared national emergencies that are domestic in purpose.
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:09.745]  For example, in 3 June 1994, Executive Order 12919, the National Defense Industrial Resource Preparedness,
[01:24:17.954 --> 01:24:19.655]  Okay, so what does it mean?
[01:24:20.035 --> 01:24:29.062]  It means that if a President of the United States wants to trigger that state of emergency, it then triggers an additional 150 statutes or laws.
[01:24:32.895 --> 01:24:33.155]  Okay?
[01:24:33.295 --> 01:24:36.358]  So I'm not, like, making this stuff up as I go here.
[01:24:36.678 --> 01:24:42.362]  So these are the kinds of things that are in play, and any president can do it.
[01:24:42.843 --> 01:24:45.885]  What we will see, I believe— You're talking about states of emergency.
[01:24:45.945 --> 01:24:47.486]  I'm talking about states of emergency.
[01:24:47.746 --> 01:24:50.729]  These are declared national emergencies.
[01:24:50.769 --> 01:24:55.932]  There's 43 of them in this country right now that are on the books, and all the president has to do is say,
[01:24:56.673 --> 01:24:57.233]  Pull the trigger.
[01:24:57.253 --> 01:24:58.013]  Okay?
[01:24:58.033 --> 01:25:05.075]  And once they pull the trigger, 150 laws kick in, and those statutes that when they kick in, it gives extraordinary power.
[01:25:05.095 --> 01:25:18.699]  It gives the power to the president, and then the president can push that power down to their various cabinet ministries, like Department of Agriculture can declare all farms are now going to be owned by the United States government.
[01:25:19.139 --> 01:25:21.200]  They can declare all banks.
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:25.722]  They can shut banks down or they can shut you down in your banks.
[01:25:26.202 --> 01:25:29.023]  I mean, these are the kinds of things that these are.
[01:25:29.063 --> 01:25:29.844]  That's big stuff.
[01:25:29.904 --> 01:25:31.084]  I mean, never mind the little stuff.
[01:25:31.104 --> 01:25:34.005]  So these are some of the things that are on the books right now.
[01:25:34.045 --> 01:25:34.966]  Let me just back up briefly.
[01:25:35.646 --> 01:25:39.611]  A year ago, the FDIC online, but they said we better not tell the public.
[01:25:39.831 --> 01:25:42.775]  They brag and say we're going to have a bail-in soon.
[01:25:42.795 --> 01:25:47.340]  We're going to get an order to seize people's money out of their accounts.
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:48.041]  It's coming.
[01:25:48.441 --> 01:25:49.843]  And I'm sure you've seen the video.
[01:25:49.863 --> 01:25:50.664]  They say that there.
[01:25:50.684 --> 01:25:53.087]  So they're even quietly preparing for all this.
[01:25:53.487 --> 01:25:53.667]  Yeah.
[01:25:53.807 --> 01:25:54.227]  Sorry to interrupt.
[01:25:54.247 --> 01:25:59.910]  So I'm going to read just, because this is stuff that I've written about, and I've talked about, and I think about, and I look at, and I examine.
[01:26:00.210 --> 01:26:01.571]  I mean, just to give you a couple ideas.
[01:26:01.951 --> 01:26:08.774]  Public and private materials, services, and facilities are to be allocated as deemed necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense.
[01:26:09.114 --> 01:26:16.697]  So the president can say, for national defense purposes, for national security, and this is already a declared national emergency that's on the books.
[01:26:16.717 --> 01:26:18.058]  Now all they got to do is say, trigger that.
[01:26:18.298 --> 01:26:18.578]  Okay?
[01:26:19.178 --> 01:26:23.000]  Another one would be, each cabinet member is given responsibility for his sector of the nation.
[01:26:24.568 --> 01:26:24.808]  Okay?
[01:26:25.068 --> 01:26:29.070]  Department of Homeland Security, Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense.
[01:26:29.410 --> 01:26:35.653]  The Secretary of Health and Human Services can tell hospitals who they can admit and who they may not treat.
[01:26:35.813 --> 01:26:39.955]  The Secretary of the Treasury can tell banks who can have an account and who cannot.
[01:26:40.095 --> 01:26:41.255]  And I just mentioned this.
[01:26:41.595 --> 01:26:44.797]  Secretary of Agriculture can tell farmers they cannot farm.
[01:26:45.317 --> 01:26:46.117]  I'm not kidding you.
[01:26:46.177 --> 01:26:48.478]  So, you know, I think you get the idea.
[01:26:48.698 --> 01:26:50.599]  And by the way, they're training wheel all this.
[01:26:51.019 --> 01:26:59.883]  We've had Kerry not just say get rid of the First Amendment yesterday, he's gone around giving speeches, I don't know if you know this, but for listeners may not, saying there's too many farmers, the U.N.
[01:26:59.923 --> 01:27:01.244]  needs to shut down more farms.
[01:27:01.284 --> 01:27:03.304]  I mean, they're actually already getting us ready.
[01:27:03.544 --> 01:27:04.765]  Don't get me going on the U.N.
[01:27:04.845 --> 01:27:09.487]  So let's talk about the wars overseas and how they play in because we're watching
[01:27:10.107 --> 01:27:15.491]  We're watching the potential in Eastern Europe for a nuclear exchange.
[01:27:15.531 --> 01:27:26.200]  And when I use the word nuclear as a weapon system, that's probably the most dangerous weapon system that we can imagine because of the devastating and long-term effects that it will have.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:50.316]  So I'll start with Eastern Europe, because I know there's constant breaking news with what's going on in the Middle East right now, and I'll give you my take on that as well, and how it impacts our election, and how they, the folks that are in power right now, may use these wars to potentially, I mean, so again, if I can think it, they can think it, to maybe even declare that we cannot have an election.
[01:27:50.456 --> 01:27:54.940]  I mean, that sounds crazy to us, but we're dealing in a different
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:56.621]  Period of history here.
[01:27:56.641 --> 01:28:05.605]  We're dealing in a different period of time with people who are, they have every desire to take this country over, and we never have another election.
[01:28:05.665 --> 01:28:24.616]  So, Eastern Europe, so we have now, we've increased the scale of the war, we've increased the scope of the war, we now have very, very sophisticated weapon systems that we have given to Ukraine, ATACMs, they call them, their long-range missile capabilities.
[01:28:25.356 --> 01:28:27.577]  And they're very sophisticated to use.
[01:28:27.877 --> 01:28:36.221]  The Ukrainians, I guess, can eventually learn how to use them, but they're using them almost immediately upon arrival, and they've been using them, and they've been firing them into Russia.
[01:28:36.741 --> 01:28:42.264]  So, in order to be able to do that in any kind of sophisticated way, it's going to take people that are trained on them.
[01:28:42.364 --> 01:28:43.904]  So, more than likely, we have U.S.
[01:28:43.964 --> 01:28:49.027]  contractors that are working on behalf of the Ukrainian military and Ukrainian government.
[01:28:49.067 --> 01:28:49.987]  So, that's that side.
[01:28:50.387 --> 01:28:51.728]  The other side, the Russian side.
[01:28:52.088 --> 01:29:00.214]  So, there have been all kinds of statements coming out, and you've got to listen to these people, all kinds of statements coming out of the various ministries of Russia.
[01:29:00.714 --> 01:29:11.862]  One of which, which I read the other day, it was probably, I think it was in a Newsweek article, a couple of articles, where they talked about Russia having adjusted its nuclear policy.
[01:29:12.403 --> 01:29:17.767]  So, it doesn't say what that means, but does the adjustment of their nuclear policy mean that it's first use?
[01:29:18.467 --> 01:29:20.808]  I mean, so what is the adjustment that they made?
[01:29:20.848 --> 01:29:27.132]  But there's clear evidence now that the Russians have adjusted their nuclear use policy.
[01:29:27.192 --> 01:29:35.857]  Now you have to start to really look at, you know, all of the intelligence capabilities that we have out there to be able to monitor the kinds of capabilities that they have.
[01:29:35.917 --> 01:29:36.978]  Bombers, submarines.
[01:29:37.458 --> 01:29:37.758]  I think so.
[01:29:58.792 --> 01:29:59.152]  We're good.
[01:30:28.732 --> 01:30:30.154]  We're good to go.
[01:30:46.374 --> 01:31:06.709]  They also said very recently, I think in less than a week ago, that the consequences of these engagements that are coming out of Ukraine right now against land-based targets inside of Russia, they are not going to just put the blame on Ukraine, that they've specifically said NATO and the United States of America.
[01:31:06.749 --> 01:31:15.496]  Putin said if any conventional heavy weapons fall on us, we may use nuclear weapons, not conventional, back in a national address Tuesday.
[01:31:15.916 --> 01:31:21.679]  So you have to start to, you know, again, you just look at that scenario and you look at what exists over there.
[01:31:21.919 --> 01:31:28.743]  Now, I can tell you, folks, that, you know, looking at these, you know, could you achieve peace in Eastern Europe?
[01:31:29.003 --> 01:31:29.583]  Absolutely.
[01:31:29.743 --> 01:31:31.084]  I mean, absolutely.
[01:31:31.104 --> 01:31:34.406]  I mean, if you go back and just read the Budapest Accords of 1994, you come forward
[01:31:36.767 --> 01:31:43.209]  You know, you look at the current situation, I mean, you look at the culture, the dynamics, the demographics, all these kinds of things.
[01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:47.170]  So when we start to talk about stopping the killing, right?
[01:31:47.190 --> 01:31:58.494]  I mean, Russia has, frankly, other than the use of nuclear weapons, Russia has zero capability to be able to go into NATO and take over NATO like they used to have during the days of the former Soviet Union.
[01:31:59.694 --> 01:32:06.881]  There is a lie that's happening in our country right now by saying, Russia, Russia, Russia, we've got to have a boogeyman.
[01:32:07.262 --> 01:32:16.832]  And one of the reasons why we have to have that boogeyman, and remind me about this because I won't dig into it just yet, maybe after the break, the United States government runs on two books.
[01:32:17.392 --> 01:32:17.752]  Two books.
[01:32:17.772 --> 01:32:21.054]  This is one of the reasons why they wanted me out of the White House so quickly.
[01:32:21.295 --> 01:32:22.175]  They run on two books.
[01:32:22.215 --> 01:32:28.139]  The books that are transparent, that the American people can see the budget of the United States, and another set of books.
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:30.281]  It's like a crime scene.
[01:32:30.561 --> 01:32:36.325]  And that other set of books is a completely different set of dollars, still U.S.
[01:32:36.365 --> 01:32:44.730]  taxpayer dollars, that flows into systems, programs, and nefarious activities that we get ourselves involved in worldwide.
[01:32:45.831 --> 01:32:47.172]  Talk about where the bodies are buried.
[01:32:47.672 --> 01:32:54.739]  I'm giving you a glimpse into where the bodies are buried right now, but until we get back in charge, which 37 days from now, let's work it hard.
[01:32:54.779 --> 01:32:59.684]  We need to get back in charge so we can unravel this mess that we have.
[01:32:59.924 --> 01:33:02.386]  So that's Eastern Europe right now.
[01:33:02.967 --> 01:33:07.151]  The threat of nuclear war is as high as I've ever felt it.
[01:33:07.791 --> 01:33:19.197]  And I've studied and looked and been part of our military over the last 40 years and certainly, you know, studied enough history to understand the potential times when nuclear weapons were in play.
[01:33:19.657 --> 01:33:21.698]  So now let's jump to the to the Middle East.
[01:33:21.878 --> 01:33:23.119]  Everybody's watching this.
[01:33:24.139 --> 01:33:25.160]  We're good to go.
[01:33:43.638 --> 01:33:45.100]  You know, come up for air here.
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:57.637]  If Khomeini doesn't come up out of his bunker pretty soon and say, we need to back channel some sort of suit for peace because, you know, these guys become cowards after a little bit when they start to hide in their own holes, right?
[01:33:57.657 --> 01:33:58.818]  Thinking that they're going to be safe.
[01:34:01.321 --> 01:34:11.428]  Israel has demonstrated a level of bullet, what I call bulletproof intelligence, to be able to do an incredible level of devastation in a period of about, I don't know, two weeks?
[01:34:11.948 --> 01:34:13.949]  Where they've taken out so many leaders.
[01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:19.713]  And when they take out these leaders... Are they using mainly HUMET or is it they've hacked into all the phones and machines they're listening to?
[01:34:20.494 --> 01:34:21.535]  It's a combination.
[01:34:21.655 --> 01:34:22.936]  It's definitely a combination.
[01:34:22.976 --> 01:34:24.077]  I think it's years.
[01:34:24.237 --> 01:34:25.698]  It's years of sacrifice.
[01:34:25.818 --> 01:34:28.701]  It's years of work in the intelligence arena.
[01:34:29.201 --> 01:34:31.563]  So it's a combination of all these ints, right?
[01:34:31.583 --> 01:34:35.807]  The human intelligence, geospatial intelligence, open source intelligence.
[01:34:35.887 --> 01:34:40.251]  I mean, you know, the signals, all of these kinds of things.
[01:34:40.351 --> 01:34:41.132]  It's spies.
[01:34:41.672 --> 01:34:42.853]  Spies are important.
[01:34:43.534 --> 01:34:44.335]  And part of it is
[01:34:44.915 --> 01:34:45.936]  We're good to go.
[01:35:07.481 --> 01:35:12.186]  The world is blown away by the level of bulletproof intelligence that the Israelis have demonstrated.
[01:35:12.207 --> 01:35:16.752]  They're no longer hiding what their plans are.
[01:35:17.052 --> 01:35:23.360]  Their plans are to take out the leadership, destroy these organizations, and stop Iran from saying
[01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:26.802]  You know, you're the son of Satan because we're the Satan.
[01:35:26.842 --> 01:35:29.885]  American people, you know, America is the real Satan according to Iran.
[01:35:30.225 --> 01:35:32.207]  And we are going to not destroy you.
[01:35:32.247 --> 01:35:33.388]  We're going to wipe you off.
[01:35:33.408 --> 01:35:35.449]  We're going to wipe you off the face of the planet.
[01:35:35.489 --> 01:35:39.152]  We're going to annihilate you as a society, as a nation.
[01:35:39.612 --> 01:35:40.813]  That's what Iran wants to do.
[01:35:41.594 --> 01:35:47.919]  And all these people out there online and the media and all these people that are the, you know, you can hate me, you can whatever.
[01:35:48.039 --> 01:35:48.579]  I don't care.
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:52.623]  I mean, we are now in a place where we have a country
[01:35:53.243 --> 01:35:59.525]  You know, whatever you think happened on the 7th of October, whatever the reasoning was, whatever the lack of security was.
[01:35:59.605 --> 01:36:03.967]  In fact, I think I was on this show very close on the tail of that attack.
[01:36:04.427 --> 01:36:06.248]  So I've already talked about that.
[01:36:06.288 --> 01:36:08.089]  Whatever you think about that, it doesn't matter.
[01:36:08.769 --> 01:36:10.290]  Israel's sitting there and they're attacked.
[01:36:10.350 --> 01:36:11.531]  We still have hostages.
[01:36:11.571 --> 01:36:13.693]  There are still hostages being held, right?
[01:36:14.093 --> 01:36:16.736]  And the hostages that were held were brutalized.
[01:36:17.096 --> 01:36:19.278]  So this is a murderous type of people.
[01:36:19.638 --> 01:36:20.999]  And I've been to Israel plenty of times.
[01:36:21.039 --> 01:36:22.760]  I've been to actually all these countries.
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.722]  I've been in all these countries in the Middle East.
[01:36:25.242 --> 01:36:30.026]  So I'm telling you something that I have personal experience, personal scar tissue over.
[01:36:30.547 --> 01:36:33.089]  And we're looking at a democracy
[01:36:34.386 --> 01:36:35.890]  In a cauldron of hatred.
[01:36:36.532 --> 01:36:37.615]  And we cannot have that.
[01:36:37.696 --> 01:36:38.438]  You can't have that.
[01:36:38.478 --> 01:36:41.647]  So, if we're trying to live in peace in the Middle East, so, okay.
[01:36:42.358 --> 01:36:46.641]  Again, you can debate me on where I stand.
[01:36:46.661 --> 01:36:48.181]  Regardless, how does it affect the election?
[01:36:48.382 --> 01:36:50.043]  So both of these things.
[01:36:50.083 --> 01:36:55.826]  So the administration right now, they are looking at how can they use this, right?
[01:36:55.886 --> 01:36:58.608]  How can they elevate the noise level?
[01:36:59.228 --> 01:37:03.811]  Because if it gets to a point where they feel like they're going to potentially lose everything,
[01:37:04.591 --> 01:37:12.679]  I don't think it's out of the question for them to say, declare a national emergency, and we're going to have to hold on the election.
[01:37:13.099 --> 01:37:14.100]  I mean, wow.
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:16.022]  Could the deep state stage false flags?
[01:37:16.062 --> 01:37:18.384]  Could the deep state stage false flags or even kill Trump?
[01:37:19.205 --> 01:37:20.005]  Would they do that?
[01:37:20.025 --> 01:37:20.806]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:37:20.826 --> 01:37:21.627]  We've already seen this.
[01:37:21.667 --> 01:37:22.648]  We've already seen it happen.
[01:37:22.668 --> 01:37:26.731]  So I know, and I know we're going to jump here in a second, but
[01:37:27.472 --> 01:37:45.300]  The other element, so this is a big deal, they're going to continue to drive us, and if you, all you gotta do is turn on any of the corporate media, and they're talking about these things all the time about, you know, how bad this is, how bad this, how bad the Russians are, how bad the Israelis are, and what they need to do to sue for peace with their, we gotta have peace, I mean when,
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:51.343]  When Biden and Macron out of France said it the other day, they said it as though they had talked to Netanyahu.
[01:37:51.383 --> 01:37:56.386]  Netanyahu stands up there in front of the World State and says, I wasn't part of that conversation.
[01:37:56.586 --> 01:37:58.387]  How about bringing us into that conversation?
[01:37:58.807 --> 01:38:01.488]  The people that are being constantly attacked, right?
[01:38:01.888 --> 01:38:12.134]  So I could go into great, great detail on both of these enemies, so to speak, the enemies in the Middle East, the enemies in Russia and Europe.
[01:38:12.694 --> 01:38:27.862]  In detail as to what their capabilities are, but what this administration, our administration is going to do, they're going to continue to use this and they're going to continue to beat on, you know, on Donald Trump as to what, how dangerous he is and what he would cause, you know, to happen in the world, right?
[01:38:28.162 --> 01:38:40.488]  And we already know the kinds of things that he did, but they're going to continue to lie and deceive enough people back to that scenario that I talked about with, that I call plausible deniability, where there's a, it's a 272 to 266 type
[01:38:42.689 --> 01:38:47.915]  We're going to have a health emergency, and we already have had a number of them declared, right?
[01:38:47.935 --> 01:38:50.237]  They've got those warmed up and ready.
[01:39:01.648 --> 01:39:12.713]  I mean, it was another report yesterday or I saw where people, you know, started to get they were they became contagious to somebody that came back from I think it was Asia.
[01:39:13.213 --> 01:39:17.395]  The other the other one that's a little bit bigger, and it's one that's not necessarily in our control.
[01:39:17.936 --> 01:39:18.476]  And in fact.
[01:39:19.196 --> 01:39:29.179]  If you look at Executive Order 14067, it's the declaration of a digital currency, a digital currency system in America.
[01:39:29.639 --> 01:39:36.181]  The Biden-Harris administration, they signed off on it about two and a half years ago, Executive Order 14067.
[01:39:37.461 --> 01:39:40.623]  And that's why I'm worried they're going to bring down the banking system and force us onto the new one.
[01:39:40.923 --> 01:39:52.770]  So the BRICS, Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, plus another consortium of countries that are joining it, they have their summit in about three weeks.
[01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:55.751]  And I believe this summit is going to be held in Russia.
[01:39:56.552 --> 01:39:58.413]  Russia is the head.
[01:39:58.553 --> 01:40:02.175]  They're the chair of the BRICS consortium now.
[01:40:02.955 --> 01:40:06.377]  And when they have this summit, they've already been talking about this.
[01:40:06.417 --> 01:40:15.622]  So if you've been following the different countries, you've been following the pre-meetings to the big meeting when all the leadership comes together, they've already made a lot of decisions about what they're going to do.
[01:40:16.023 --> 01:40:18.724]  So what they're going to do is they're going to move away from the U.S.
[01:40:18.764 --> 01:40:21.686]  dollar as the currency of choice for global trade.
[01:40:22.426 --> 01:40:28.471]  And they're going to move to a central bank digital currency system that will be backed by gold.
[01:40:29.032 --> 01:40:33.556]  Alex has talked about this on many shows about who is hoarding the gold out there.
[01:40:33.576 --> 01:40:35.818]  What are the nation states that are hoarding the gold?
[01:40:35.878 --> 01:40:38.080]  China, Russia, Saudis.
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:45.527]  I mean, all of these different nations that are hoarding gold because when they move to this central bank digital currency system, then
[01:40:46.127 --> 01:40:46.587]  The U.S.
[01:40:46.627 --> 01:40:55.730]  dollar, you know, I don't believe it will collapse, but what will happen is all of a sudden, you're going to find cash is not king anymore.
[01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:59.171]  You're going to find out that, okay, so what does that mean?
[01:40:59.191 --> 01:41:01.011]  Well, you better have your credit cards ready.
[01:41:01.031 --> 01:41:03.792]  You better know exactly how much you have in your savings.
[01:41:03.812 --> 01:41:05.873]  You better know exactly how much you have in the banks.
[01:41:06.353 --> 01:41:07.913]  It's going to have to be controlled.
[01:41:07.953 --> 01:41:10.594]  Otherwise, we're going to have absolute chaos.
[01:41:11.274 --> 01:41:14.215]  And I don't believe that they want that just yet.
[01:41:14.815 --> 01:41:16.596]  I don't believe that they want that just yet.
[01:41:16.656 --> 01:41:21.978]  It is like, it is like saying, you know, COVID has just hit national emergency.
[01:41:21.998 --> 01:41:23.179]  We're going to do all these things.
[01:41:23.199 --> 01:41:27.100]  We're going to take all these actions and they continue to do it in this administration.
[01:41:27.881 --> 01:41:30.882]  If they, if they move to this and they're going to, they're going to move to it.
[01:41:30.942 --> 01:41:42.187]  So, so, you know, I'm, I'm saying it right now and it, and the decision, the final decision where, where they're going to say, go, they pound the table is going to be in this, in this summit that's upcoming.
[01:41:42.667 --> 01:41:44.268]  And it is such an important thing to be,
[01:41:44.748 --> 01:41:45.468]  We're good to go.
[01:42:04.918 --> 01:42:12.502]  You've got the U. S. With its but also advising kind of with gates like they might merge the two that you've got the bricks with its own.
[01:42:13.282 --> 01:42:20.145]  And the Russians, the Chinese are using the word Ukraine to accelerate their central bank digital currency system being launched.
[01:42:20.906 --> 01:42:25.108]  And then we've been telegraphed by the WF and the U. S. Government that.
[01:42:26.124 --> 01:42:26.604]  We're good to go.
[01:42:56.084 --> 01:42:56.544]  We're good to go.
[01:42:56.684 --> 01:42:57.485]  We're good to go.
[01:42:57.505 --> 01:42:57.905]  We're good to go.
[01:42:57.945 --> 01:42:58.406]  We're good to go.
[01:42:58.426 --> 01:42:59.146]  We're good to go.
[01:42:59.186 --> 01:43:00.067]  We're good to go.
[01:43:00.127 --> 01:43:00.647]  We're good to go.
[01:43:00.707 --> 01:43:01.488]  We're good to go.
[01:43:01.508 --> 01:43:02.108]  We're good to go.
[01:43:02.148 --> 01:43:02.789]  We're good to go.
[01:43:02.809 --> 01:43:04.009]  We're good to go.
[01:43:04.029 --> 01:43:04.690]  We're good to go.
[01:43:04.990 --> 01:43:06.031]  We're good to go.
[01:43:06.071 --> 01:43:07.492]  We're good to go.
[01:43:07.512 --> 01:43:08.172]  We're good to go.
[01:43:08.192 --> 01:43:08.673]  We're good to go.
[01:43:08.693 --> 01:43:09.133]  We're good to go.
[01:43:09.153 --> 01:43:09.773]  We're good to go.
[01:43:09.813 --> 01:43:10.254]  We're good to go.
[01:43:10.294 --> 01:43:10.834]  We're good to go.
[01:43:10.994 --> 01:43:12.035]  We're good to go.
[01:43:12.055 --> 01:43:12.896]  We're good to go.
[01:43:13.056 --> 01:43:13.716]  We're good to go.
[01:43:13.736 --> 01:43:14.757]  We're good to go.
[01:43:14.797 --> 01:43:15.778]  We're good to go.
[01:43:15.798 --> 01:43:16.498]  We're good to go.
[01:43:16.618 --> 01:43:17.199]  We're good to go.
[01:43:17.219 --> 01:43:17.759]  We're good to go.
[01:43:17.779 --> 01:43:18.139]  We're good to go.
[01:43:18.159 --> 01:43:18.600]  We're good to go.
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:19.320]  We're good to go.
[01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:20.201]  We're good to go.
[01:43:20.221 --> 01:43:20.601]  We're good to go.
[01:43:20.621 --> 01:43:21.361]  We're good to go.
[01:43:21.381 --> 01:43:21.882]  We're good to go.
[01:43:22.062 --> 01:43:22.682]  We're good to go.
[01:43:22.702 --> 01:43:23.303]  We're good to go.
[01:43:23.323 --> 01:43:23.423]  We're
[01:43:24.446 --> 01:43:33.942]  This is a big deal because the currency of choice for global trade for 50, 60 years now has been the U.S.
[01:43:33.983 --> 01:43:34.884]  dollar, right?
[01:43:34.904 --> 01:43:35.806]  The petrodollar.
[01:43:35.826 --> 01:43:37.749]  It's been based on a variety of things.
[01:43:38.587 --> 01:43:55.726]  So if we move away from that, then we move away from where the United States of America is this global leader with the greatness of the American people behind it, and our ability to innovate, our ability to manufacture, our ability to do all these kinds of things.
[01:43:56.386 --> 01:43:58.907]  All of those things are going to be stolen from us.
[01:43:58.947 --> 01:44:00.368]  They'll be taken away from us.
[01:44:00.388 --> 01:44:01.148]  Stay right there, General.
[01:44:01.168 --> 01:44:01.648]  We got a break.
[01:44:01.949 --> 01:44:02.829]  Hour number three coming up.
[01:44:02.849 --> 01:44:04.870]  You're going to do 50 more minutes with us as Chase Kaiser takes over.
[01:44:05.210 --> 01:44:06.971]  When he says big, folks, he's very calm about it.
[01:44:06.991 --> 01:44:09.692]  Notice, when something's really important, he gets even quieter when I get louder.
[01:44:10.172 --> 01:44:13.494]  This is earth-shaking changes coming to a head now.
[01:44:13.894 --> 01:44:16.375]  Competing global systems, the old order going down.
[01:44:16.855 --> 01:44:18.016]  Regardless, it's going down.
[01:44:18.356 --> 01:44:20.258]  The question is what comes on the other side.
[01:44:20.518 --> 01:44:23.481]  They don't want Trump at the helm to keep America strong and free.
[01:44:23.921 --> 01:44:28.906]  They want America to basically be sucked into the larger world government via this crisis.
[01:44:28.926 --> 01:44:30.227]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:44:30.267 --> 01:44:30.687]  Stay with us.
[01:44:37.353 --> 01:44:39.054]  I'm gonna live forever.
[01:44:39.555 --> 01:44:41.296]  I'm gonna cross that river.
[01:44:41.796 --> 01:44:43.618]  I'm gonna catch tomorrow.
[01:44:43.638 --> 01:44:46.160]  All right, we're now into the Sunday night live portion.
[01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:46.940]  6 to 8 p.m.
[01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:48.701]  every Sunday that Chase Geyser hosts.
[01:44:48.741 --> 01:44:52.184]  He's ready like a racehorse, you know, with the gate about to open.
[01:44:52.704 --> 01:44:54.366]  And so he'll be coming here in about 15 minutes.
[01:44:54.386 --> 01:44:55.606]  But General Flynn's been very gracious.
[01:44:55.627 --> 01:44:57.068]  He's been traveling all over the country.
[01:44:57.768 --> 01:44:58.148]  We're good to go.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.841]  Just briefly before he hit those final points.
[01:45:17.821 --> 01:45:23.264]  I just cannot find words to describe the urgency and the average person because I talked to him goes.
[01:45:23.284 --> 01:45:24.525]  Well, what do I do?
[01:45:24.685 --> 01:45:25.865]  I can't beat him by myself.
[01:45:25.945 --> 01:45:27.666]  No, just get your family to vote.
[01:45:28.066 --> 01:45:28.647]  Speak out.
[01:45:28.927 --> 01:45:29.747]  Speak at your church.
[01:45:30.328 --> 01:45:31.128]  Raise your kids good.
[01:45:31.288 --> 01:45:41.592]  You know, teach a Sunday school class, pray to God, support this broadcast, become more educated, go out and protest against tyranny, go out and promote and support shows and things that tell the truth.
[01:45:42.072 --> 01:45:47.694]  Nobody's going to fix it all themselves, but all of us together can move the needle big time.
[01:45:48.414 --> 01:45:54.677]  And that's why they tried to kill Trump twice in the last two and a half months, is because for all the fraud they've got backed in,
[01:45:56.297 --> 01:45:57.557]  He's going to have such a landslide.
[01:45:57.617 --> 01:45:58.318]  He's going to win.
[01:45:58.358 --> 01:46:08.320]  I 100% take an hour to go over why I know that and on the ground evidence in the head of Raspi's and polls has been so accurate over the years, predicting that there wouldn't be enough big enough landslide four years ago.
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:10.541]  And so they were able to steal it.
[01:46:10.561 --> 01:46:13.122]  But now the landslide so big bigger than 2016.
[01:46:13.442 --> 01:46:15.722]  They're predicting he will win, and they've been very accurate.
[01:46:16.082 --> 01:46:17.683]  So there's a lot more that goes into that.
[01:46:17.703 --> 01:46:21.744]  So that's why the system so desperate, and I asked this question, but I belabored.
[01:46:21.784 --> 01:46:22.104]  It's maybe
[01:46:26.205 --> 01:46:27.406]  So you forget the first thing I asked.
[01:46:27.766 --> 01:46:36.949]  How angry do you think and apoplectic is the deep state that all the shenanigans going back now for eight years before he was even in office to take out Trump have failed?
[01:46:37.049 --> 01:46:38.830]  They've got to see the hand of God on him.
[01:46:39.170 --> 01:46:42.431]  That's got to really, really get in their brain.
[01:46:42.651 --> 01:46:44.572]  Yeah, I mean, you said this earlier.
[01:46:44.612 --> 01:46:46.973]  I mean, this is a this is satanic.
[01:46:47.053 --> 01:46:47.713]  I mean, these people.
[01:46:48.493 --> 01:46:49.994]  These people are evil.
[01:46:50.034 --> 01:46:56.560]  Never mind the World Economic Forum and the globalists that are outside of the contiguous borders of the United States of America.
[01:46:56.580 --> 01:47:04.206]  We have some of them right here in this country, in the likes of many of the people that are in the current government and those that are surrounded and swirl around it.
[01:47:04.906 --> 01:47:17.196]  One of the things that I, and I've written about this here recently, that I believe that Kamala and the cabinet right now, the cabinet that exists that's supposed to be serving us, I think that they have a duty under the 25th
[01:47:18.397 --> 01:47:19.219]  We're good to go.
[01:47:26.690 --> 01:47:27.010]  We're good.
[01:47:27.190 --> 01:47:27.551]  We're good.
[01:47:27.631 --> 01:47:28.672]  We're good.
[01:47:28.692 --> 01:47:29.172]  We're good.
[01:47:29.212 --> 01:47:30.373]  We're good.
[01:47:30.393 --> 01:47:30.654]  We're good.
[01:47:30.674 --> 01:47:31.014]  We're good.
[01:47:31.034 --> 01:47:31.334]  We're good.
[01:47:31.374 --> 01:47:32.355]  We're good.
[01:47:32.435 --> 01:47:32.715]  We're good.
[01:47:32.735 --> 01:47:33.116]  We're good.
[01:47:33.136 --> 01:47:33.456]  We're good.
[01:47:33.536 --> 01:47:33.756]  We're good.
[01:47:33.776 --> 01:47:34.076]  We're good.
[01:47:34.097 --> 01:47:34.437]  We're good.
[01:47:34.457 --> 01:47:35.117]  We're good.
[01:47:35.157 --> 01:47:35.478]  We're good.
[01:47:35.498 --> 01:47:35.778]  We're good.
[01:47:35.798 --> 01:47:36.118]  We're good.
[01:47:36.218 --> 01:47:36.499]  We're good.
[01:47:36.519 --> 01:47:36.759]  We're good.
[01:47:36.779 --> 01:47:37.099]  We're good.
[01:47:37.159 --> 01:47:37.820]  We're good.
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:38.080]  We're good.
[01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:38.420]  We're good.
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:38.640]  We're good.
[01:47:38.681 --> 01:47:39.041]  We're good.
[01:47:39.061 --> 01:47:39.481]  We're good.
[01:47:39.601 --> 01:47:40.122]  We're good.
[01:47:40.162 --> 01:47:40.702]  We're good.
[01:47:40.722 --> 01:47:41.083]  We're good.
[01:47:41.103 --> 01:47:41.343]  We're good.
[01:47:41.383 --> 01:47:41.843]  We're good.
[01:47:41.903 --> 01:47:42.104]  We're good.
[01:47:42.124 --> 01:47:42.324]  We're good.
[01:47:42.384 --> 01:47:42.664]  We're good.
[01:47:42.684 --> 01:47:42.944]  We're good.
[01:47:42.964 --> 01:47:43.305]  We're good.
[01:47:43.325 --> 01:47:43.525]  We're good.
[01:47:43.605 --> 01:47:44.025]  We're good.
[01:47:44.065 --> 01:47:44.325]  We're good.
[01:47:44.345 --> 01:47:44.686]  We're good.
[01:47:44.706 --> 01:47:45.186]  We're good.
[01:47:45.206 --> 01:47:45.406]  We're good.
[01:47:45.426 --> 01:47:45.627]  We're good.
[01:47:45.647 --> 01:47:45.867]  We're good.
[01:47:46.627 --> 01:47:46.928]  We're good.
[01:47:46.948 --> 01:47:47.348]  We're good.
[01:47:47.368 --> 01:47:47.668]  We're good.
[01:47:47.688 --> 01:47:47.929]  We're good.
[01:47:47.949 --> 01:47:48.229]  We're good.
[01:47:48.249 --> 01:47:48.509]  We're good.
[01:47:48.529 --> 01:47:48.769]  We're good.
[01:47:48.789 --> 01:47:49.010]  We're good.
[01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.370]  We're good.
[01:47:49.390 --> 01:47:49.670]  We're good.
[01:47:50.811 --> 01:47:57.373]  He's saying a secret committee runs the White House, but wait, even the Washington Post and New York Times have asked the last three months, who's running things?
[01:47:57.573 --> 01:47:59.213]  And they go, well, it's a cabal.
[01:47:59.553 --> 01:48:01.194]  Think about where we already are.
[01:48:01.274 --> 01:48:01.874]  Please continue.
[01:48:01.994 --> 01:48:02.894]  Think about that.
[01:48:03.194 --> 01:48:09.316]  So some group of people are running this country right now because Joe Biden clearly is not running the country.
[01:48:09.776 --> 01:48:12.558]  He clearly does not have the mental faculties to be able to do it.
[01:48:13.018 --> 01:48:27.066]  Kamala Harris is campaigning and we've all learned what we've, you know, the American people now have seen why she got no votes in the Democrat primary when she was running for president a number, you know, a fair number of years ago.
[01:48:27.186 --> 01:48:29.588]  So who's running the country?
[01:48:30.628 --> 01:48:35.011]  And that group of people, some of them are inside and some of them are outside.
[01:48:35.772 --> 01:48:44.218]  And you know, one of them's name starts with the letter O. So we are in a really different place right now.
[01:48:44.338 --> 01:48:57.467]  And I believe that as it stands right now, our country is on the brink of something that we cannot get ourselves out of anytime soon or in a way that we are victorious or we're the winners.
[01:48:57.507 --> 01:48:58.568]  We're on the good side of the
[01:48:59.568 --> 01:49:01.449]  Of the victory line, right?
[01:49:02.010 --> 01:49:02.750]  And I believe that.
[01:49:02.850 --> 01:49:03.731]  I believe that right now.
[01:49:03.831 --> 01:49:24.702]  So as I look at the world and as I look at all the dynamics that are happening from the invasion that's taken place in our country, the death toll from fentanyl that's Chinese-made, a Mexican cartel introduced, the Mexican cartels right now south of our border are going through a war, an internal war, and the consequences of that
[01:49:25.422 --> 01:49:30.767]  It's going to have another generation of leaders rising up to run those cartels.
[01:49:31.108 --> 01:49:34.571]  And these people are more dangerous than the ones that are currently there.
[01:49:34.972 --> 01:49:41.218]  And they are about to—they now have a communist as a president in Mexico.
[01:49:41.898 --> 01:49:43.839]  And you've got Trudeau up in the north.
[01:49:43.879 --> 01:49:45.559]  You've got, you know, Kamala.
[01:49:45.579 --> 01:49:49.260]  That's really I mean, Biden's not doing he's not in charge.
[01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:50.400]  He's definitely not in charge.
[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:55.601]  So I believe that there's a duty for her to take the cabinet to sit down with the cabin.
[01:49:55.641 --> 01:49:57.102]  I mean, let's face it, folks.
[01:49:57.122 --> 01:50:05.864]  The first cabinet meeting that they had was the other day after a year of no cabinet meetings and who chairs the cabinet meeting Jill Jill Biden.
[01:50:05.904 --> 01:50:06.704]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:50:07.144 --> 01:50:07.284]  So
[01:50:07.944 --> 01:50:10.969]  So we're in a really, we're in an interesting place.
[01:50:11.309 --> 01:50:15.756]  And I'm not, you know, I'm one of these people that like rise to the challenge, America, right?
[01:50:15.876 --> 01:50:16.897]  So, so what?
[01:50:17.038 --> 01:50:23.026]  In a little bit of time that I have left here, and thank you so much for allowing me to have this platform today.
[01:50:23.607 --> 01:50:35.891]  It's a very important platform for Alex and what we're trying to do, which is we're trying to raise the voices of those of us, you know, the Paul Reveres, like he says, you're all Paul Reveres out there, right?
[01:50:36.732 --> 01:50:41.073]  I am one of these, like, big fan favorites of Thomas Paine, right?
[01:50:41.113 --> 01:50:44.074]  This is not a time, you know, for summer soldiers, right?
[01:50:44.114 --> 01:50:49.476]  This is a time like Lincoln or like George Washington crossing the Delaware.
[01:50:49.836 --> 01:50:51.237]  The man got down on his knees.
[01:50:51.317 --> 01:50:51.757]  I know this.
[01:50:51.797 --> 01:50:52.237]  He prayed.
[01:50:52.837 --> 01:51:07.510]  I know that he prayed, I've read that letter that he wrote to his wife, and then he got up, and he got up off of his knees, and he went across in a very uncertain time, in very uncertain waters that were
[01:51:08.516 --> 01:51:09.457]  Mainly frozen.
[01:51:10.038 --> 01:51:13.121]  And right now, we kind of are in one of those places.
[01:51:13.161 --> 01:51:15.384]  Sort of metaphorically, we're in one of those places right now.
[01:51:15.824 --> 01:51:18.387]  And what we can't allow ourselves to be is frozen.
[01:51:19.128 --> 01:51:20.430]  We now have to stand up.
[01:51:20.710 --> 01:51:21.711]  Say your prayers.
[01:51:22.091 --> 01:51:22.852]  Get off your knees.
[01:51:23.553 --> 01:51:25.314]  Get organized at the local level.
[01:51:25.854 --> 01:51:27.955]  Do not allow these people to steal this election.
[01:51:27.995 --> 01:51:33.658]  Do not allow these people to undermine what we know is right within our Constitution.
[01:51:34.018 --> 01:51:37.820]  Don't let somebody tell you something that is just so unbelievable.
[01:51:38.261 --> 01:51:42.023]  If you have to take a minute, you have to reel back and you got to go do a little bit of research.
[01:51:42.403 --> 01:51:44.284]  Go do a little bit of research.
[01:51:44.764 --> 01:51:46.525]  Use your God-given common sense.
[01:51:47.065 --> 01:51:49.907]  Right now is the time for this country and the millions
[01:51:50.447 --> 01:51:58.010]  Millions and millions of people who know better, who know what's good for us, who know how to do things throughout this country.
[01:51:58.710 --> 01:52:05.052]  If we don't get behind Donald Trump, because right now I believe, and I wrote about this earlier today, in fact it'll
[01:52:05.712 --> 01:52:16.136]  Go out tonight, probably, that what this administration, what I say they're doing is they're allowing Kamala Harris to sleepwalk to this presidency.
[01:52:16.616 --> 01:52:23.698]  You know, not doing tough interviews, taking her down to the border now, you know, like she cares about the border.
[01:52:24.098 --> 01:52:26.919]  I mean, she didn't know, she couldn't give you a map.
[01:52:27.059 --> 01:52:33.741]  If you gave her a map of Europe and said, you know, write the names of these countries in, she could barely do that.
[01:52:33.761 --> 01:52:35.122]  She probably couldn't do it.
[01:52:35.362 --> 01:52:36.903]  Why did they choose such a moron?
[01:52:36.943 --> 01:52:38.004]  I mean, I've got my own idea.
[01:52:38.124 --> 01:52:46.671]  Well, you know, like I said, she's sleepwalking to the presidency because she's totally controlled, as is Joe Biden, as was Joe Biden.
[01:52:46.691 --> 01:52:47.692]  Joe Biden's been this way.
[01:52:48.353 --> 01:52:57.100]  His mental health issues have been known for a long time, and it's just gotten to the point where it's so bad that they need to declare the 25th Amendment.
[01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:57.900]  They have a duty.
[01:52:58.441 --> 01:53:00.022]  They have a duty to the Constitution.
[01:53:00.062 --> 01:53:01.884]  They have a duty to the American people to do that.
[01:53:02.264 --> 01:53:05.706]  Because we're already living under this bureaucratic star chamber secret coup.
[01:53:06.627 --> 01:53:06.827]  Yeah.
[01:53:07.167 --> 01:53:08.588]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:53:08.648 --> 01:53:14.992]  So, you know, I come on a stage, I pop in, I pop off, and I pop out.
[01:53:15.932 --> 01:53:22.697]  And what I'm hoping for, and I know Alex is doing this, he's in this every single day as I am in my own way.
[01:53:23.117 --> 01:53:26.959]  And we're out there trying to be champions, and we're looking for champions.
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:28.240]  And we need champions.
[01:53:28.260 --> 01:53:29.041]  I think what you're saying is,
[01:53:30.287 --> 01:53:32.670]  The listeners are more important than we are.
[01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:33.851]  We're just focal points.
[01:53:34.872 --> 01:53:38.216]  People have to really get in that understanding.
[01:53:38.576 --> 01:53:49.388]  The most important person on a presidential election day could be a precinct volunteer who sees something or waves the red flag of caution and says,
[01:53:50.549 --> 01:53:51.790]  We're not putting up with this stuff anymore.
[01:53:51.810 --> 01:53:53.231]  Look how narrowly they stole the last one.
[01:53:53.411 --> 01:53:53.891]  Exactly.
[01:53:54.231 --> 01:53:58.514]  So when we start, because we're going to see these same kinds of things.
[01:53:58.614 --> 01:54:00.736]  There are a couple of cases.
[01:54:00.776 --> 01:54:14.244]  There's going to be a hearing tomorrow, I believe, in a court in Georgia that has to do with this, and I won't get into the details of it, but it has to do with encryption keys that have been discovered in these machines that we use for our voting.
[01:54:14.585 --> 01:54:16.446]  And so now it's in a court.
[01:54:16.806 --> 01:54:19.647]  It's going to be heard tomorrow in, uh, in Georgia.
[01:54:19.927 --> 01:54:20.928]  Pay attention to that one.
[01:54:20.968 --> 01:54:22.128]  That's a big, big deal.
[01:54:22.148 --> 01:54:29.051]  And the feds are now coming into states where they're pulling illegal aliens, confirmed and dead people off the rolls and saying, you can't do that.
[01:54:29.391 --> 01:54:29.591]  Right.
[01:54:29.892 --> 01:54:33.153]  I mean, so at least we're forcing them out in the open that they're thieving.
[01:54:33.433 --> 01:54:35.514]  Yeah, and that's what we want to do.
[01:54:35.554 --> 01:54:37.736]  We want to put them on their heels constantly.
[01:54:38.696 --> 01:54:40.317]  Incremental victories on the battlefield.
[01:54:40.337 --> 01:54:51.864]  When you feel like all is lost and you're in the throes of your life, the good leaders will say, okay, I need to give the men some motivation.
[01:54:52.265 --> 01:54:54.446]  I need to get the troops fired up.
[01:54:54.686 --> 01:54:57.208]  We have been finding places to have victories.
[01:54:57.488 --> 01:54:58.949]  We've had a lot of victories, folks.
[01:54:59.289 --> 01:55:00.150]  You've got to go find them.
[01:55:01.070 --> 01:55:12.414]  You know, there's different victories that are happening in places like Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, some interesting developments in Michigan, Georgia, Nevada, all these different places.
[01:55:12.454 --> 01:55:14.515]  So we are fighting for these incremental victories.
[01:55:14.675 --> 01:55:19.617]  By the way, I mean, populists are getting elected all over the world, in Austria today, anti-globalists, Zuckerberg.
[01:55:19.977 --> 01:55:20.778]  We're good to go.
[01:55:50.037 --> 01:55:51.018]  They've got to make their move now.
[01:55:51.259 --> 01:55:55.163]  Yeah, the last thing that I will say is on the battlefield.
[01:55:55.203 --> 01:55:58.708]  You are given an objective to attack, right?
[01:55:59.248 --> 01:56:00.049]  And you attack it.
[01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:04.395]  But what you have to do is you have to fight through the objective, right?
[01:56:04.415 --> 01:56:05.937]  You have to go past it.
[01:56:06.457 --> 01:56:25.988]  And where we are right now, our objective, my objective has been over the last couple of years is to wake this country up and to the understanding, and Alex has done an amazing job of this, to the understanding that what we are facing, and we've been laying this out here over the last hour or so, so now what we have to do is we have to fight through this objective of getting our country back under the control of we the people.
[01:56:26.409 --> 01:56:31.712]  Because we have an individual in the case of President Donald J. Trump who is
[01:56:32.392 --> 01:56:40.558]  You know, the leading candidate, major party, he is being our champion out there, and we need to get him to that moral high ground.
[01:56:40.658 --> 01:56:55.290]  And he, I know, if you look at today, I mean, what he posted today was a beautiful sentiment for me, from my perspective, because it's my namesake's Archangel Michael's, today is the feast of St.
[01:56:55.310 --> 01:56:55.870]  Michael.
[01:56:57.331 --> 01:57:12.843]  And so when I saw what Trump posted, it was another realization to me that he understands that there is this giant connection between the beauty of our Constitution, the greatness of our people, and the faith that binds us all together.
[01:57:12.943 --> 01:57:13.784]  Divine inspiration.
[01:57:13.804 --> 01:57:15.065]  You got interrupted by a break last hour.
[01:57:15.105 --> 01:57:22.291]  You were talking about Trump's really, you talked to him obviously, but he's posting things and saying things that show he's exponentially learning now.
[01:57:23.031 --> 01:57:45.208]  And I know going back into the White House, going back into being the leader of the free world, of the United States of America, with all of the types of things that we are facing right now, I mean, God help us, we need this man to get back into office so we can actually recapture the essence of this greatness of what America
[01:57:45.908 --> 01:57:48.149]  You know, is, and what America can be.
[01:57:48.689 --> 01:57:51.430]  And that's why I love the bumper sticker, Make America Great Again.
[01:57:51.470 --> 01:57:54.390]  I love the phrase, America First.
[01:57:54.451 --> 01:57:57.691]  America First has been something that, you know, it's like, why not?
[01:57:58.212 --> 01:57:59.732]  You know, I take care of my family.
[01:57:59.792 --> 01:58:00.852]  I take care of my house.
[01:58:00.932 --> 01:58:01.913]  I take care of my home.
[01:58:01.953 --> 01:58:03.273]  I take care of my yard.
[01:58:03.753 --> 01:58:09.275]  I take care of all those things first to make sure that it's all set so I can go around this country to do what I'm doing.
[01:58:09.935 --> 01:58:10.936]  And that's all we're trying.
[01:58:10.956 --> 01:58:12.879]  That's all we're asking the American people to do.
[01:58:12.959 --> 01:58:20.689]  People need to recognize this is existential, which again, for people that don't really, I know most people get it, but quantify in closing what existential means.
[01:58:20.749 --> 01:58:23.933]  I know most people know, but we need to burn their brains.
[01:58:24.353 --> 01:58:24.533]  Yeah.
[01:58:25.214 --> 01:58:39.843]  Existential means the end of the republic, the end of this experiment in what the United States of America was created to be, which is this amazing place on the planet.
[01:58:40.404 --> 01:58:42.605]  In the history of the world, there's been nothing like it.
[01:58:43.166 --> 01:58:46.368]  It will mean the end of our constitutional republic.
[01:58:47.228 --> 01:58:50.330]  That's what this means if we don't get this election right.
[01:58:50.491 --> 01:58:52.672]  It's that important.
[01:58:52.772 --> 01:58:54.374]  And I want people to understand that.
[01:58:55.494 --> 01:58:58.116]  Be fearless.
[01:58:58.297 --> 01:59:02.320]  Be absolutely fearless about what you believe in.
[01:59:02.420 --> 01:59:05.162]  And use good God-given common sense to do the right thing.
[01:59:05.182 --> 01:59:07.844]  And the right thing is always harder to do.
[01:59:08.304 --> 01:59:09.225]  But take that path.
[01:59:09.565 --> 01:59:10.486]  And it but in the you're right.
[01:59:10.506 --> 01:59:14.071]  Moral courage is very rare, and it's hard, but it's what builds everything good.
[01:59:14.091 --> 01:59:15.092]  I'm gonna make this final point.
[01:59:15.653 --> 01:59:20.479]  The only reason you can travel the country tirelessly to reaching your shows all the time.
[01:59:20.559 --> 01:59:22.021]  Huge crowds, films, books.
[01:59:22.301 --> 01:59:24.283]  I mean, they hate your guts because you're effective.
[01:59:24.844 --> 01:59:27.525]  People back you and they support you at General Flynn dot com.
[01:59:28.065 --> 01:59:28.466]  I read it.
[01:59:28.506 --> 01:59:29.006]  It's amazing.
[01:59:29.026 --> 01:59:32.707]  Your fifth generational books on warfare that just came out.
[01:59:33.128 --> 01:59:33.848]  Absolutely essential.
[01:59:33.888 --> 01:59:34.628]  General Flynn dot com.
[01:59:34.648 --> 01:59:36.369]  Everybody should go to Flynn film dot com.
[01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:38.530]  If you haven't seen it, bring your neighbors over.
[01:59:38.610 --> 01:59:38.950]  Watch it.
[01:59:38.990 --> 01:59:40.231]  You're crazy if you don't get the books.
[01:59:41.311 --> 01:59:42.031]  You don't see the film.
[01:59:42.211 --> 01:59:44.493]  I'm taking on the deep state.
[01:59:44.593 --> 01:59:46.414]  The only reason I'm still here through all this.
[01:59:46.594 --> 01:59:47.174]  It's not me.
[01:59:47.334 --> 01:59:48.275]  I mean, I want to keep fighting.
[01:59:48.315 --> 01:59:48.735]  That's easy.
[01:59:48.755 --> 01:59:49.455]  I'm not going to give up.
[01:59:49.535 --> 01:59:51.076]  I'm like a horse will run to have a heart attack.
[01:59:51.536 --> 01:59:52.317]  That's not a problem.
[01:59:52.337 --> 01:59:55.919]  But if you don't back the horse, feed it, give it water and stuff, it'll fall over and die.
[01:59:56.279 --> 01:59:58.380]  And General Flynn's obviously the same way and you are.
[01:59:58.800 --> 02:00:04.424]  So when you pray for us, when you spread the word about what we're doing, and when you support us, that is beyond critical.
[02:00:04.464 --> 02:00:08.286]  Support Trump, pray for Trump, share his articles, share his events, share his speeches.
[02:00:08.326 --> 02:00:09.627]  That's how you override the enemy.
[02:00:09.907 --> 02:00:15.250]  Your power on your text message, on your email, word of mouth, tell folks about a local station you listen to.
[02:00:15.650 --> 02:00:16.351]  Feel small.
[02:00:16.751 --> 02:00:17.592]  There's millions of you.
[02:00:17.712 --> 02:00:18.492]  It's massive.
[02:00:18.532 --> 02:00:23.455]  When you get excited and you take action, nothing on earth can stop you because God's working through you.
[02:00:23.495 --> 02:00:25.196]  And if God's with us, who can be against us?
[02:00:25.216 --> 02:00:25.697]  So please,
[02:00:26.337 --> 02:00:28.038]  Go to the Alex Jones store dot com.
[02:00:28.459 --> 02:00:29.479]  Separate from InfoWars.
[02:00:29.519 --> 02:00:32.342]  Whatever happens to InfoWars, the Alex Jones store dot com is there.
[02:00:32.682 --> 02:00:35.644]  Those T-shirts, those ball caps, and more stuff's about to be added.
[02:00:36.004 --> 02:00:40.087]  That is what is going to allow, and it's already being done, the escape ship.
[02:00:40.328 --> 02:00:45.091]  And when they think they blow up one Death Star, they're going to go, Oh my God, when another one comes wheeling out at them.
[02:00:45.111 --> 02:00:46.012]  So I'm just going to stop right there.
[02:00:46.372 --> 02:00:53.998]  But the point is, we've got it basically, the new Death Star basically built, but we need some other things to get it fully armed and operational.
[02:00:54.398 --> 02:00:56.581]  So you want to see us continue to kick ass?
[02:00:56.921 --> 02:01:00.105]  Go to the Alex Jones store dot com and power up the next Death Star.
[02:01:00.125 --> 02:01:03.228]  I hate to use a bad guy term, but they see us like a Death Star of their operation.
[02:01:03.268 --> 02:01:08.754]  So the desk there's new say multiple Death Stars, but they got to get fueled up and ready.
[02:01:08.794 --> 02:01:09.275]  We're almost ready.
[02:01:09.275 --> 02:01:09.555]  We're good.
[02:01:09.575 --> 02:01:09.875]  We're good.
[02:01:10.156 --> 02:01:10.396]  We're good.
[02:01:10.436 --> 02:01:10.896]  We're good.
[02:01:10.976 --> 02:01:11.617]  We're good.
[02:01:11.637 --> 02:01:11.897]  We're good.
[02:01:11.917 --> 02:01:12.277]  We're good.
[02:01:12.297 --> 02:01:12.638]  We're good.
[02:01:12.658 --> 02:01:12.878]  We're good.
[02:01:12.898 --> 02:01:13.098]  We're good.
[02:01:13.118 --> 02:01:13.418]  We're good.
[02:01:13.438 --> 02:01:13.879]  We're good.
[02:01:14.219 --> 02:01:14.499]  We're good.
[02:01:14.519 --> 02:01:14.819]  We're good.
[02:01:14.839 --> 02:01:15.180]  We're good.
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:15.440]  We're good.
[02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:15.720]  We're good.
[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:16.000]  We're good.
[02:01:16.020 --> 02:01:16.280]  We're good.
[02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:16.561]  We're good.
[02:01:16.581 --> 02:01:16.841]  We're good.
[02:01:16.861 --> 02:01:17.161]  We're good.
[02:01:17.221 --> 02:01:17.842]  We're good.
[02:01:17.862 --> 02:01:18.142]  We're good.
[02:01:18.182 --> 02:01:18.562]  We're good.
[02:01:18.582 --> 02:01:19.003]  We're good.
[02:01:19.023 --> 02:01:19.623]  We're good.
[02:01:19.683 --> 02:01:19.943]  We're good.
[02:01:19.983 --> 02:01:20.243]  We're good.
[02:01:20.263 --> 02:01:20.524]  We're good.
[02:01:20.544 --> 02:01:20.844]  We're good.
[02:01:20.864 --> 02:01:21.064]  We're good.
[02:01:21.164 --> 02:01:21.464]  We're good.
[02:01:21.484 --> 02:01:21.705]  We're good.
[02:01:21.725 --> 02:01:21.965]  We're good.
[02:01:21.985 --> 02:01:22.185]  We're good.
[02:01:22.205 --> 02:01:22.445]  We're good.
[02:01:22.465 --> 02:01:22.665]  We're good.
[02:01:22.685 --> 02:01:23.046]  We're good.
[02:01:23.386 --> 02:01:23.766]  We're good.
[02:01:23.806 --> 02:01:24.066]  We're good.
[02:01:24.086 --> 02:01:24.527]  We're good.
[02:01:24.547 --> 02:01:24.907]  We're good.
[02:01:24.927 --> 02:01:25.147]  We're good.
[02:01:25.187 --> 02:01:25.447]  We're good.
[02:01:25.468 --> 02:01:25.728]  We're good.
[02:01:25.748 --> 02:01:26.008]  We're good.
[02:01:26.028 --> 02:01:26.348]  We're good.
[02:01:26.368 --> 02:01:27.029]  We're good.
[02:01:27.069 --> 02:01:27.409]  We're good.
[02:01:27.429 --> 02:01:27.669]  We're good.
[02:01:27.689 --> 02:01:27.909]  We're good.
[02:01:27.929 --> 02:01:28.370]  We're good.
[02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:28.750]  We're good.
[02:01:28.770 --> 02:01:29.130]  We're good.
[02:01:29.170 --> 02:01:29.431]  We're good.
[02:01:30.971 --> 02:01:34.012]  It's a real honor to know you and work with you and your great team.
[02:01:34.312 --> 02:01:39.973]  All right, we're gonna go to a quick break and the great Chase Geyser comes in for the next hour and 43 minutes.
[02:01:40.034 --> 02:01:40.534]  Stay with us.
[02:01:45.035 --> 02:01:50.776]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:01:51.857 --> 02:01:58.018]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:01:58.038 --> 02:01:59.719]  I'm down to my last few chips.
[02:02:00.956 --> 02:02:01.877]  It's like a video game.
[02:02:01.897 --> 02:02:07.722]  You're winning the last level, fighting the last boss, but you're on one life, quarter power, one more hit, you're blown up.
[02:02:08.402 --> 02:02:10.104]  I use the Raticon analogy.
[02:02:10.624 --> 02:02:12.606]  I'm not a big Star Trek fan, but I like that movie.
[02:02:12.986 --> 02:02:28.260]  Some of the 60s shows I liked growing up as a kid, but the point is, it's all put together with that movie, where the ship, you know, the big weapon's about to go off, they're gonna get killed, they're trying to race away from the detonation of the Genesis Project, and Kirk says to Scotty, I need warp one in five minutes and we're all dead.
[02:02:30.172 --> 02:02:30.884]  And that's not it.
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:33.180]  Really the case.
[02:02:33.301 --> 02:02:34.902]  I mean, there's a lot of stuff lined up.
[02:02:35.002 --> 02:02:38.244]  It takes a lot of time to deal with a lot of big groups want to come in and launch stuff.
[02:02:38.264 --> 02:02:39.124]  I've got to go through that.
[02:02:39.144 --> 02:02:40.926]  I've got to make sure they're not going to control what I say.
[02:02:41.446 --> 02:02:42.367]  We've got backups.
[02:02:42.407 --> 02:02:44.248]  We've got to, but it takes time to set that up.
[02:02:44.668 --> 02:02:56.836]  The person I trust the most is me and Alex Jones sitting on no money, basically, and not having money to, I have to personally go in and pay for, but they don't take my name, which is preposterous, but they're trying or the social media.
[02:02:57.056 --> 02:02:59.578]  If they shut down InfoWars, I have to be able to hold them off.
[02:02:59.618 --> 02:03:01.399]  Like I've been doing, they got Giuliani in a year.
[02:03:01.459 --> 02:03:02.380]  I've been fighting them seven years.
[02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:05.561]  So, grace of God, we're in the fight.
[02:03:06.161 --> 02:03:13.843]  But I've got to fight that and pay for the bankruptcy defense in the next few months, and it's conservatively $300,000.
[02:03:14.083 --> 02:03:19.584]  And you've got to sell a lot of t-shirts when you're only getting a few bucks per t-shirt yourself to pay for that.
[02:03:19.604 --> 02:03:21.245]  So they're great t-shirts.
[02:03:21.345 --> 02:03:21.805]  You need them.
[02:03:22.885 --> 02:03:24.145]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:03:24.766 --> 02:03:26.066]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:03:27.063 --> 02:03:29.486]  And a lot of folks are responding, and I don't want to belabor here.
[02:03:30.107 --> 02:03:32.250]  But I belabored yesterday, and we got big support.
[02:03:32.690 --> 02:03:35.514]  And it's nothing more frustrating than having to just cover this to survive.
[02:03:36.956 --> 02:03:37.757]  But that's what I'm doing.
[02:03:37.897 --> 02:03:38.919]  They are great t-shirts.
[02:03:39.059 --> 02:03:40.661]  It's all there, thealextrendstore.com.
[02:03:40.741 --> 02:03:42.023]  Separately, the sponsor.
[02:03:43.325 --> 02:03:47.287]  My dad's company, based right here in Central Texas, drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:03:47.847 --> 02:03:53.469]  Great nano silver products, great next level financial energy, KavaChill, Top Brain, RocketRest SleepAid.
[02:03:54.009 --> 02:03:56.250]  You go there and like 70% of the stuff's sold out.
[02:03:56.270 --> 02:03:57.671]  Because my dad's up against the wall.
[02:03:57.691 --> 02:03:59.372]  They've been attacking and going after him for two years.
[02:03:59.992 --> 02:04:01.613]  He spent basically everything he had on that.
[02:04:01.893 --> 02:04:09.596]  He put everything else he had in to get some staple products reordered and four new products that start coming in next week that are going to be great.
[02:04:09.696 --> 02:04:11.216]  So you go there and you're like, well there's almost nothing here.
[02:04:11.357 --> 02:04:12.237]  Now we're up against the wall.
[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:15.661]  So, go get what's there.
[02:04:15.941 --> 02:04:16.981]  Stuff that's left's all great.
[02:04:17.041 --> 02:04:19.282]  Silver Bullet, Audacio Energy, Comichel.
[02:04:19.302 --> 02:04:21.922]  A lot of other stuff.
[02:04:21.942 --> 02:04:23.463]  There's still, like, more than a dozen items left.
[02:04:23.483 --> 02:04:24.663]  There was, like, 50 there before.
[02:04:25.363 --> 02:04:27.304]  And just get it, and then you'll see the stuff come back.
[02:04:28.944 --> 02:04:29.704]  It's like farmers.
[02:04:31.065 --> 02:04:33.646]  They gotta have money to hold back to buy seed or save seed.
[02:04:35.166 --> 02:04:42.168]  Drjonesnaturals.com had to put everything in to get the next seeds to continue the cycle of funding our operation, and my dad's operation funding us.
[02:04:43.584 --> 02:04:45.325]  So that's why you're like, well, there's almost nothing left here.
[02:04:45.385 --> 02:04:47.387]  It's all got, we didn't have the money to buy more stuff.
[02:04:47.427 --> 02:04:48.568]  He didn't have money to buy more stuff.
[02:04:50.949 --> 02:04:53.011]  So we are up against the wall here.
[02:04:54.472 --> 02:04:56.973]  So I won't have to do this every show.
[02:04:58.274 --> 02:05:00.036]  If more than 1% go, you know what?
[02:05:00.156 --> 02:05:07.020]  I think I'm going to stand up for the country and myself in the future and support people that are obviously the top enemy of the globalists.
[02:05:07.061 --> 02:05:07.661]  It's a no brainer.
[02:05:08.081 --> 02:05:09.562]  And I'm going to get great products in the process.
[02:05:09.662 --> 02:05:10.223]  It's just,
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:13.020]  But I get it.
[02:05:13.100 --> 02:05:14.642]  Most people, this is just a show.
[02:05:14.662 --> 02:05:17.324]  This is not a show, people.
[02:05:18.144 --> 02:05:24.009]  This is the defense of the future of our species that's having a big effect on the enemy.
[02:05:25.029 --> 02:05:27.710]  So I want to thank those that understood this and have bought the products and love them.
[02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:34.072]  They've got like 4.7 star reviews, and I want to encourage those that haven't to go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:05:34.472 --> 02:05:35.452]  And then info or story.
[02:05:35.492 --> 02:05:38.273]  Anything you order, even if we get shut down, it's all there, won't be shut down for months.
[02:05:39.073 --> 02:05:43.234]  You know, if that's the case, because even though they sell it and bad guys get it, it'll take a few weeks, they say, to shut it down.
[02:05:43.254 --> 02:05:44.675]  So we're about two months out from shutdown.
[02:05:46.236 --> 02:05:54.163]  So you'll get all your product at m4store.com, Vitamin Refusions back in stock for 40% off and so much more at m4store.com as well.
[02:05:54.183 --> 02:05:55.425]  All right, I'm going to blitz news, stay with us.
