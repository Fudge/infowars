[00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:27.190]  Ladies and gentlemen, following on the news given in our bulletin a moment ago, the Government Meteorological Bureau has requested the large observatories of the country to keep an astronomical watch on any further disturbances occurring on the planet Mars.
[00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:34.929]  Due to the unusual nature of this occurrence, we have arranged an interview with a noted astronomer, Professor Pearson, who will give us his views on this event.
[00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:38.850]  In a few moments, we will take you to the Princeton Observatory at Princeton, New Jersey.
[00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:47.409]  We are ready now to take you to the Princeton Observatory at Princeton, where Carl Phillips, our commentator, will interview Professor Richard Pearson, famous astronomer.
[00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.890]  We take you now to Princeton, New Jersey.
[00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:53.729]  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.850]  Carl Phillips speaking to you from the Observatory at Princeton.
[00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.530]  I'm standing in a large semi-circular room, pitch-flat and step for an oblong slit in the ceiling.
[00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.069]  Through this opening, I can see a sprinkling of stars that cast a kind of faulty glow over the intricate mechanism of the huge telescope.
[00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.069]  The ticking sound you hear is the vibration of the clockwork.
[00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.790]  Professor Pearson stands directly above me on a small platform, peering through the giant lens.
[00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:23.989]  I ask you to be patient, ladies and gentlemen, during any delay that may arise during our interview.
[00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:30.049]  Besides a ceasefire watch of the heavens, Professor Pearson may be interrupted by telephone or other communications.
[00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.590]  During this period, he is in constant touch with the astronomical centers of the world.
[00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.049]  Professor, may I begin our question?
[00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:38.709]  Any time, Mr. Phillips.
[00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.170]  Professor, would you please tell our radio audience exactly what you see as you observe the planet Mars through your telescope?
[00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:47.450]  Nothing unusual at the moment, Mr. Phillips.
[00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.689]  A red disc, swimming in the blue sea.
[00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.670]  Transverse stripes across the disc.
[00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.579]  Quite distinct now, because Mars has to be at the point nearest the Earth, in opposition, as we call it.
[00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.540]  In your opinion, what do these transverse stripes signify, President?
[00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.859]  Not canals, I can assure you, Mr. Phillips.
[00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:06.239]  Yes.
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.400]  Although, that's the popular conjecture of those who imagine Mars to be inhabited.
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.780]  From a scientific viewpoint, stripes are merely the result of atmospheric conditions peculiar to the planet.
[00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:21.719]  Then, you're quite convinced, as a scientist, that living intelligence as we know it does not exist on Mars?
[00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.770]  The chances against it are a thousand to one.
[00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.389]  And yet, how do you account for these gas eruptions occurring on the surface of the planet at regular intervals?
[00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.169]  Well, if I cannot account for it.
[00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:38.330]  By the way, Tucker, for the benefit of our listeners, how far is Mars from the Earth?
[00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.330]  Approximately 40 million miles.
[00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:42.810]  Well, that seems a safe enough distance.
[00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.189]  Just a moment, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.289]  Someone has just handed Professor Pearson a message.
[00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:55.969]  While he reads it, let me remind you that we are speaking to you from the observatory in Princeton, New Jersey, where we are interviewing the world-famous astronomer, Professor Pearson.
[00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.509]  One moment, please.
[00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.909]  Professor Pearson has passed me a message which he has just received.
[00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.590]  Professor, may I read the message to the listening audience?
[00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:03.909]  Certainly.
[00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.569]  Ladies and gentlemen, I shall read you a wire addressed to Professor Pearson from Dr. Gray of the Natural History Museum, New York.
[00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.270]  Quote.
[00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:13.280]  9.15 p.m.
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.280]  Eastern Standard Time.
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.180]  Seismograph registered shock of almost earthquake intensity occurring within a radius of 20 miles of Princeton.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.500]  Please investigate.
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.520]  Signed, Lloyd Gray, Chief of Astronomical Division.
[00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:26.400]  Unquote.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.960]  Professor Pearson, does this occurrence possibly have something to do with the disturbances observed on the planet Mars?
[00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.280]  Hardly, Mr. Phillips.
[00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:38.620]  This is probably a meteorite of unusual size, and its arrival at this particular time is merely a coincidence.
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.400]  However, we shall conduct research as soon as daylight permits.
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.319]  Thank you, Professor.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:51.319]  Ladies and gentlemen, for the past ten minutes, we've been speaking to you from the Observatory at Princeton, bringing you a special interview with Professor Pearson, noted astronomer.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.060]  This is Carl Phillips speaking.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.680]  We are returning you now to our New York studio.
[00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:03.860]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, your host of The Alex Jones Show today.
[00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:21.879]  We've got amazing breaking reports coming up, reports from Alex Jones on some recent comments from RFK Jr. regarding Project 2025, as well as a groundbreaking report at the bottom of the hour from Alex Jones regarding the EU coming out and admitting that depopulation is part of their agenda.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.920]  Now, we know that there's been a lot of crazy news over the course of the last several days, if not weeks.
[00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:43.209]  Pertaining to these unidentified aerial phenomenon, and it seems very obvious now at this point, based on all the expert analysis, all the conversations we've had, all the research that we've done, that these craft are U.S. military-grade crafts.
[00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:54.370]  That are conducting either surveillance or dropping chemtrails on populations or even set up in a defensive position as a defensive array for long-range missiles.
[00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:58.689]  Stay tuned for more breaking news and reports from Alex Jones on the other side.
[00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.329]  We interrupt this broadcast with a special report from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.410]  Attempts have been made to neutralize the info warrior known as Alex Jones.
[00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.149]  Countless attacks have been witnessed and reported in an effort to bring him down.
[00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:27.990]  Alex Jones has been sighted on the battlefield fighting against the forces of evil.
[00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.629]  We're not gonna go down and just shut our mouths and you just put up with this.
[00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.910]  We know where the bodies are buried folks and one way or another we're gonna stay on here.
[00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:44.009]  We're receiving reports that Alex Jones has broken through the front lines and is now heading toward the broadcast studio.
[00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:46.730]  All efforts to silence him have failed.
[00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:50.769]  Emerging victorious against the New World Order, here's your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:55.329]  Find the InfoWars transmission at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.709]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.290]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, host of the Alex Jones Show today and tomorrow.
[00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:08.009]  Some of Wednesday, Owen Schroer will also be hosting on Thursday and Friday, I believe.
[00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.689]  We've got some great guest hosts coming up, great guests booked for the show this week as well.
[00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:21.110]  As all of these details continue to unfold, amazing reports from Alex Jones coming up right now as well.
[00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:34.069]  We see that there's been all of this talk about these UAPs, these UFOs, these drones all over the skies of New Jersey, the tri-state area now in Southern California being reported, overseas in France, China, other places as well.
[00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:41.649]  And it becomes more and more obvious the more you look at these details that something is deeply wrong with what is going on.
[00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:51.949]  I don't know if they're scouring or looking for a dirty bomb here in the United States of America, something that was missing from Ukraine after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
[00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:59.040]  Or if they're setting the stage for martial law or some major terrorist event to take place on the inauguration.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:14.259]  But one thing is for sure, this is a major distraction from everything that is going on with this Trump administration, with the Department of Government Efficiency, with the developments of artificial intelligence that are happening right before our eyes that could subjugate humanity under a new world order,
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.639]  a one world government.
[00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:23.899]  But right now we have this report, this is clip number 19. Of Alex Jones commenting remotely on some comments recently from RFK Jr. Let's watch.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:39.079]  I'm about to play you a very, very important short video of RFK Jr. in the last few days on a very popular podcast where he lays out the absolute facts Because I was there in 2016 when Trump got elected.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.459]  I was there behind the scenes stuff and knew what was happening.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.199]  And I tried to warn Trump and did warn him about some of the globalists that he was bringing in.
[00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:54.699]  Trump is really smart about business, about life, has great instincts, loves America, understands economics.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.259]  But he didn't understand how D.C. worked.
[00:07:57.399 --> 00:08:02.839]  He was an outsider other than the fact he knew that you just donated everybody and they stay out of your way with real estate business.
[00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:05.050]  And he got set up.
[00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:09.129]  And in the last nine years, he's figured out how things really operate.
[00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:15.449]  He's bringing in a really diverse team of populist, conservative, liberal, all those terms mean nothing.
[00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:20.449]  The point is, not predatory, not trying to set up monopolies, but trying to innovate.
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:32.460]  Trying to empower the people, trying to cut prices, trying to, you know, cheapen the price of energy, trying to stop war, trying to clean up the food and water and the, you know, drugs, all of it.
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:44.259]  And so what RFK Jr. says here is so key because so many people either got mad at Trump and thought he was bad because some of the bad people he brought in, or they think it's 3D chess, all that made up stuff that was sort of some master plan.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.539]  I've been there.
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.779]  I know the major players.
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.460]  What Kennedy is saying is dead on.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.820]  And Trump said similar things in the last year on the campaign trail.
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.220]  So this is what's going on.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.779]  Trump is admitting he got set up.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.179]  He's bringing in RFK Jr. to expose the poison shots and go after Big Pharma and all of it.
[00:09:00.299 --> 00:09:03.360]  And he's bringing Big Pharma in to let him know how the cow ate the cabbage.
[00:09:03.539 --> 00:09:04.919]  So this is critical.
[00:09:05.159 --> 00:09:05.899]  This is real.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.019]  It's a real revolution against the globalists.
[00:09:08.669 --> 00:09:10.350]  And their whole Agenda 2030 operation.
[00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.230]  And this is our chance to really turn things around.
[00:09:13.669 --> 00:09:14.450]  God bless you all.
[00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.190]  Here is this very, very important report.
[00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.389]  Back to the live broadcast.
[00:09:18.289 --> 00:09:19.389]  Here's what Trump said.
[00:09:19.529 --> 00:09:21.149]  You guys know what Project 2025?
[00:09:21.429 --> 00:09:22.490]  Yeah, I'm familiar.
[00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:24.210]  Here's what Trump said.
[00:09:24.289 --> 00:09:25.690]  I didn't even ask him about that.
[00:09:25.809 --> 00:09:36.649]  But he said to me, they're trying to pin me with Project 2025. He said, I never even heard of Project 2025. And he said, that was written by a right-wing asshole.
[00:09:37.649 --> 00:09:44.070]  And then he said to me, there are left-wing assholes and there are right-wing assholes, and it was a right-wing asshole that wrote that.
[00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.529]  That was his quote.
[00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:54.669]  President Trump, to me, in 2016, 2020, I fought everything he did.
[00:09:55.009 --> 00:10:12.860]  He appointed People to, you know, we've appointed an oil industry lobbyist, Ryan Linkey, to run Interior Department, a coal industry lobbyist to run the EPA, a pharmaceutical industry lobbyist to run Health and Human Services,
[00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:18.440]  a telecom lobbyist to run the federal communications decision, and so on.
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:24.740]  And these were all people who were taking those agencies and turning them predatory against the American public.
[00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:31.419]  I was suing him and I was fighting him, publicly criticizing him.
[00:10:31.659 --> 00:10:40.919]  He said to me when we met, he said, the last time I came into office in 2016, I had no idea how to govern.
[00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:44.019]  And he said, you know, we didn't even expect to win.
[00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:48.139]  Suddenly we won, and you have now two months to figure out who.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.179]  You know, he's got 14,000 appointments to make.
[00:10:52.679 --> 00:10:58.779]  He said, I was surrounded by business people and lobbyists who said, you've got to appoint this guy, this guy, this guy.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.460]  And he said, I listened to him, and I did it.
[00:11:02.659 --> 00:11:04.860]  He said they were a bunch of bad people.
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.360]  And he said, we're not going to do that this time.
[00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:27.519]  He's interested in his legacy and he wants his legacy to be the president who ended the wars, who brought the money home to rebuild the middle class in this country, who ended the censorship, who ended the power of the CIA over the American people,
[00:11:27.799 --> 00:11:30.460]  and who made America healthy again.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.220]  Now we've got countless reports.
[00:11:33.169 --> 00:11:35.190]  Of these drones flying all over the place.
[00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:45.610]  The most bizarre aspect of these developments is the fact that our establishment, this administration, whether it's Kirby or Mayorkas or others in the administration, are denying that there's any issue at all.
[00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:50.269]  They're saying that it's not us and it's not foreigners, but we can't do anything about it.
[00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:51.090]  We can't shoot them down.
[00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.110]  We can't neutralize them.
[00:11:52.409 --> 00:11:56.149]  Which implies to me, of course, that they're covering something up.
[00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:57.710]  They're hiding something.
[00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:08.529]  The most prevalent theory now, based on the conversations that I've had, the reports that I've seen, tie into a clip that Joe Rogan shared the other day.
[00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:12.870]  He says he's genuinely concerned about drone sightings after new theory emerges.
[00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:17.690]  There was a CEO of a drone military contractor who came out with a nine-minute video.
[00:12:17.809 --> 00:12:20.830]  And I'm not going to show you the whole video, though I may show you some of it.
[00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:25.169]  This is clip number 14. Came out and said...
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:40.320]  That he'd heard months ago one of the nuclear warheads from the Soviet era that went missing in Ukraine after the collapse of the Soviet Union was identified by a whistleblower who came to him and that it went missing.
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:52.480]  And it seems to me very likely that these drones are engaged in some sort of sweep where they may be looking for this dirty bomb, this nuclear warhead which could have made its way to the United States of America.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.940]  This is clip number 14. Let's show a couple minutes of this.
[00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.789]  Hey, everyone.
[00:12:58.169 --> 00:12:59.389]  My name is John Ferguson.
[00:12:59.629 --> 00:13:03.769]  I'm the CEO of Saxon Aerospace here in Wichita, Kansas.
[00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.950]  I'm not normally a TikTok kind of a guy.
[00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.710]  I like watching this stuff every once in a while.
[00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:18.980]  But I'm a manufacturer of unmanned aircraft, military-grade Unmanned aircraft, as you can see, one of my systems here.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.679]  There's all of these mysterious drones going on off the East Coast.
[00:13:24.919 --> 00:13:34.700]  And as a professional, as a subject matter expert, I wanted to give you all my opinion on what I think could be going on with these drones.
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.720]  I don't particularly believe that these have a nefarious intent.
[00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:40.759]  I could be wrong.
[00:13:41.419 --> 00:13:44.139]  But I want to give you the truth and what I believe.
[00:13:44.139 --> 00:13:47.740]  It's my own opinion and I've not bounced this off of anybody.
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.980]  So, you know, if you think it's bullshit, whatever, that's cool.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:58.179]  You know, I don't want to spread misinformation as we know that There's a lot of that going around.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:18.120]  But anyway, back in the 1980s, Ronald Reagan had dismantled the nuclear program and there were, with Russia, there were countless nuclear missiles that were disarmed and disposed of.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.940]  Well, There were over 80, I believe.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:29.279]  There were over 80 nuclear warheads that were in Ukraine that came up missing.
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.559]  We don't know where they are.
[00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:37.759]  Maybe somebody does, but nobody really knows where these are.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.340]  And I speak with some pretty high-level government officials on this stuff, and it seems as though that is the case.
[00:14:47.919 --> 00:15:07.320]  So I spoke to a gentleman a few months ago who was trying to raise an alarm to the highest levels of our government, which they had their ears closed, about this one particular nuclear warhead that he physically put his hands on.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.879]  He physically touched this warhead that was left over from Ukraine.
[00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:16.259]  And he knew that that thing was headed towards the United States.
[00:15:19.059 --> 00:15:19.500]  Okay?
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.340]  That is a very serious deal.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:37.480]  And everyone knows that- So he goes into more details over the course of the next several minutes about how there's no reason to fly drones at night because they can't see very well at night unless they're detecting for gas leaks or radiation, in which case it would make sense that there are drones flying at night.
[00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:40.500]  And it makes sense too that they're flying all over the tri-state area.
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:47.509]  Now, what I'm very concerned about, I'm very concerned There may be a terrorist attack planned for the inauguration.
[00:15:48.549 --> 00:15:53.029]  And I don't want to just make that prediction and say that and have it be unbacked.
[00:15:53.090 --> 00:16:01.269]  But my gut, my intuition, my speculation based on all the circumstantial evidence that I've seen here is that there's a missing dirty bomb.
[00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:02.669]  They're trying to find it.
[00:16:03.539 --> 00:16:04.659]  They're looking over the Pentagon.
[00:16:04.659 --> 00:16:05.779]  They're looking over the Capitol.
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:06.559]  They're in New Jersey.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.220]  They're in New York.
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:17.159]  They're in Washington, D.C. There's this major event coming up next month, January 20th, the inauguration of President Trump as President of the United States of America.
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.399]  Vance is gonna be there.
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.559]  I'm sure Musk is gonna be there.
[00:16:19.639 --> 00:16:22.419]  The entire cabinet, the administration, all in one place.
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:31.200]  It seems to me very possible that there's gonna be an attack on that day that could wipe out thousands or millions of people.
[00:16:34.019 --> 00:16:37.100]  And that the government will say, hey, we did everything we could to try to find this weapon.
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:37.759]  It was concealed.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.139]  It was a terrorist act by Iran, or it was a terrorist attack by Russia.
[00:16:42.019 --> 00:16:47.399]  And they'll institute continuity of government, and they'll get the World War III that they've been vying for.
[00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:51.240]  So if I were Trump, and he's got better intel than I have, obviously.
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:17:00.419]  If I were Trump, I would seriously consider doing a private inauguration in the White House, in the bunker, something like that, rather than a massive inaugural event.
[00:17:01.799 --> 00:17:04.359]  But we've got countless reports of these drones all over the place.
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.079]  Mysterious drones in New York State, paralyzed airport operations.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.099]  New York is coming out and saying that they're limited in what they can do.
[00:17:11.539 --> 00:17:13.900]  More reports of a potential dirty bomb.
[00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:18.319]  Nick Sordor, in clip number 39 here, shared this earlier today.
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:29.160]  One of my favorite follows on X. Make sure you follow him at Nick Sordor, S-O-R-T-O-R. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio shut down due to unauthorized drone activity in the area.
[00:17:29.259 --> 00:17:30.339]  This is clip number 39. Listen.
[00:17:31.529 --> 00:17:37.910]  Patterson Tower, MedFlight 8, 1900 feet, about 7 miles southwest of the field by transitioning to Delta Northeast Mountain.
[00:17:39.069 --> 00:17:44.529]  MedFlight 8, Patterson Tower, use extreme caution for heavy UAS movement on the base.
[00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:46.890]  Security Forces is handling the situation.
[00:17:47.230 --> 00:18:01.390]  Suggest that or above 1700 AGL. We will maintain 2000 and on our transition for MedFlight 8. And I gotta keep the lights down so that security forces can see.
[00:18:03.069 --> 00:18:04.049]  Roger that, no problem.
[00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:06.650]  Position approved, sir.
[00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:12.269]  Approved, Med Flight 8. Med Flight 8, tower.
[00:18:14.609 --> 00:18:19.589]  Go ahead, sir, Med Flight 8. Hey sir, you're still approved through our Class Delta.
[00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:25.809]  After you leave, Columbus is going to sterilize the Class Delta as of 0330 Zulu.
[00:18:26.369 --> 00:18:28.730]  Patterson, Class Delta is closed after your transition.
[00:18:32.609 --> 00:18:33.630]  I'm sorry about that.
[00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.210]  You got stepped on by other traffic.
[00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:35.809]  Can you say again?
[00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:38.829]  Yes sir, your transition is still approved.
[00:18:39.089 --> 00:18:46.109]  However, Patterson Class Delta is sterilized as of 0330 Zulu for heavy unknown UAS activity.
[00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:51.329]  Security Forces is handling it and Columbus is going to sterilize the airspace after you leave the Delta.
[00:18:53.529 --> 00:18:54.349]  Roger that.
[00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:54.710]  No problem.
[00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:55.150]  Thank you.
[00:18:58.349 --> 00:19:00.269]  All aircraft use extreme caution.
[00:19:00.609 --> 00:19:04.170]  Patterson Class Delta is now closed for heavy UAS activity.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:13.700]  Okay, so now we've got unidentified aerial phenomena interfering with airports, airbases all over the country.
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:25.079]  From Ohio to New York to New Jersey to Washington, D.C., Reports yesterday coming out in Southern California was having unidentified aerial phenomenon as well in the sky.
[00:19:25.359 --> 00:19:36.059]  And we've got an amazing report coming up from Alex Jones at the bottom of the hour about some of the comments made, some of the policies being advocated for from the EU pertaining to depopulation.
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.460]  But why is it that the Kirby's and others...
[00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:42.789]  Aren't doing anything about this.
[00:19:42.869 --> 00:19:46.950]  Now it's interfering with our air traffic, and I would think that Pete Buttigieg would just be irate.
[00:19:47.369 --> 00:19:53.789]  After all, he is the Secretary of Transportation, and he had such a good photo op in East Palestine after that train was derailed.
[00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:57.910]  This is really starting to harm his legacy as the Secretary of Transportation.
[00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:06.930]  You would think that if it's interfering with commercial flights, maybe our government would have an interest in doing something about this.
[00:20:07.069 --> 00:20:18.369]  You would think that if it's a foreign invasion, If it's not us, then that means by definition it's a foreign invasion that Mayorkas would do something about it.
[00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:23.089]  But here he is in clip number 20 saying he's limited in his authorities to take down these drones.
[00:20:23.309 --> 00:20:23.710]  Very bizarre.
[00:20:23.869 --> 00:20:24.029]  Watch.
[00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.650]  This morning, can you clear up the confusion here?
[00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.269]  Absolutely, George, and thank you very much for having me.
[00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:48.250]  There's no question that people are seeing drones, and I want to assure the American public that we, in the federal government, have deployed additional resources, personnel, technology to assist the New Jersey State Police in addressing the drone sightings.
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:52.000]  Some of those drone sightings are, in fact, drones.
[00:20:52.339 --> 00:20:56.200]  Some are manned aircraft that are commonly mistaken for drones.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.819]  And we do see duplicative reporting.
[00:20:58.819 --> 00:21:01.619]  But there's no question that drones are being sighted.
[00:21:01.799 --> 00:21:05.079]  Let me set the record straight here, George.
[00:21:05.319 --> 00:21:10.480]  There are thousands of drones flown every day in the United States.
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.920]  Recreational drones, commercial drones.
[00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:15.759]  That is the reality.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.640]  And now he's dismissing it.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.220]  So many people have drones.
[00:21:25.059 --> 00:21:34.420]  Oh, everybody just decided to fly their drone overnight at the same time?
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:35.539]  That is the reality.
[00:21:35.759 --> 00:21:39.200]  But I want to assure the American public that we are on it.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.539]  We are working in close coordination with state and local authorities.
[00:21:43.819 --> 00:21:54.339]  And it is critical, as we all have said for a number of years, that we need from Congress additional authorities to address the drone situation.
[00:21:54.759 --> 00:21:59.480]  Our authorities currently are limited and they are set to expire.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.740]  We need them extended and expanded.
[00:22:02.019 --> 00:22:03.440]  What exactly do you need?
[00:22:04.839 --> 00:22:05.799]  This is key right here.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:15.400]  We want state and local authorities to also have the ability to counter drone activity under federal supervision.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:22.579]  That is one important element that we have requested, and we've heard it echoed by the state and local officials themselves.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:31.279]  Look, every time something alarming happens, the government always uses it as an excuse to expand regulation and expand their own power.
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:41.059]  It's so beneficial to the government's agenda to expand its own power that some of these alarming things that have happened throughout history have, I believe, been false flags.
[00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:45.160]  They've been concocted by the government itself in order to justify this regulation.
[00:22:45.279 --> 00:22:47.220]  9-11 is something I think we could have easily prevented.
[00:22:47.779 --> 00:22:50.220]  But we use it as an excuse to establish the Patriot Act.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:23:03.599]  Pearl Harbor, I think, is something that we knew about it, but we used it as an excuse to get involved in World War II. So when there isn't really a catastrophe or an alarming situation, the government will manufacture one in order to justify instituting new regulations and policies.
[00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:09.869]  And we know that the government already has the power to disable any drone that they want.
[00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:11.130]  How many videos have you seen?
[00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:17.609]  I've certainly seen dozens of videos of people attempting to fly their own personal drones up to look at these drones.
[00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:20.009]  And the signal's totally blocked off.
[00:23:20.109 --> 00:23:22.130]  Full battery, fully operational drone.
[00:23:22.289 --> 00:23:26.849]  They can't even get it off of the ground or hovers a couple of feet off of the ground and then it lands itself.
[00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:28.410]  So they're already...
[00:23:29.469 --> 00:23:38.230]  Dispersing signals in these regions that don't allow recreational drone users, individual drone users to fly their own personal drones.
[00:23:39.069 --> 00:23:53.990]  While these are being allowed, that goes to show that it's definitely the government flying these, but then they're using this alarming instance or circumstance as an excuse to justify more regulation, more legislation to interfere with individuals' ability to use this technology.
[00:23:54.630 --> 00:24:09.539]  And I understand that there are Sensitive areas, Area 51 and others, where they don't want people flying recreational drones and observing classified information or monitoring whatsoever.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:16.420]  The fact of the matter is, the government hates this idea of individual autonomy or individual power.
[00:24:16.539 --> 00:24:17.519]  It's why they want to take your guns.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:28.289]  It's why they want to regulate the hell out of artificial intelligence to make it impossible to For anyone to make their own AI so they can have a monopoly over it.
[00:24:28.309 --> 00:24:30.069]  I mean, this is Marc Andreessen in clip number five here.
[00:24:30.309 --> 00:24:39.069]  This is Marc Andreessen talking about what provoked him to endorse Trump when he heard about what these AI policies were going to be.
[00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:39.789]  Let's watch clip five.
[00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:48.730]  We had meetings in D.C. in May where we talked to them about this, and the meetings were absolutely horrifying, and we came out basically deciding we had to endorse Trump.
[00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.329]  What did you hear in those meetings?
[00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:53.230]  AI is a technology basically that the government is going to completely control.
[00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:54.809]  This is not going to be a startup thing.
[00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:59.569]  They actually said flat out to us, don't do AI startups, like don't fund AI startups.
[00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.730]  It's not something that we're going to allow to happen.
[00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:03.470]  They're not going to be allowed to exist.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.319]  There's no point.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:14.619]  They basically said AI is going to be a game of two or three big companies working closely with the government, and we're going to basically wrap them in a, you know, I'm paraphrasing, but we're going to basically wrap them in a government cocoon.
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.119]  We're going to protect them from competition.
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.279]  We're going to control them, and we're going to dictate what they do.
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:26.259]  And then I said, I don't understand how you're going to lock this down so much because the math for AI is out there and it's being taught everywhere.
[00:25:26.599 --> 00:25:36.900]  And they literally said, well, during the Cold War, we classified entire areas of physics and took them out of the research community and entire branches of physics basically went dark and didn't proceed.
[00:25:37.119 --> 00:25:41.599]  And that if we decide we need to, we're going to do the same thing to the math underneath AI. Wow.
[00:25:42.039 --> 00:25:44.259]  And I said, I've just learned two very important things.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.460]  Because I wasn't aware of the former, and I wasn't aware that you were even conceiving of doing it to the latter.
[00:25:51.329 --> 00:26:04.130]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to have a groundbreaking report coming up on the other side of this break in 90 seconds from Alex Jones talking about recent developments and comments from the EU and its leadership pertaining to depopulation.
[00:26:04.349 --> 00:26:11.690]  This anti-human agenda, it's all tied together with this drone thing, with the AI stuff, with these globalist institutions.
[00:26:12.089 --> 00:26:14.849]  And that's why it's more important now than ever that you support InfoWars.
[00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:29.490]  Keep Alex Jones on the air by going to thealexjonesstore.com because if they eradicate, These alternative media outlets, voices, then they will successfully reacquire, reattain a monopoly on information.
[00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:33.829]  And once they have a monopoly on information, then subjugation is virtually guaranteed.
[00:26:34.049 --> 00:26:37.329]  We can't rely on rogue billionaires like Elon Musk to save us time and time again.
[00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:40.390]  This fight is going to continue on generation after generation.

[00:28:22.019 --> 00:28:22.400]  They're stronger.

[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.940]  Calendar, it's fun.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.220]  Folks that barely came up with this, it's a great way to give a gift.
[00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:50.589]  We have the campaign coins, liberty coins, that are nice mementos.
[00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:52.650]  From $9, you know, up to $25.
[00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:54.549]  And it all funds the Infowar.

[00:29:02.589 --> 00:29:05.369]  We'll know by the middle of January whether we're going to survive.
[00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.609]  The U.S. trustee's still been left there, though it was over.
[00:29:08.969 --> 00:29:12.029]  The judge said you're actually going to sell it to who actually offers the most money.
[00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.109]  We're going to work on that with outside groups that won't censor us.
[00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:17.829]  But who knows what Soros and Bloomberg are going to do.
[00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:20.450]  But regardless, we continue on.
[00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:21.589]  The info war is you.
[00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:21.990]  It's me.
[00:29:22.069 --> 00:29:22.710]  It's the people.
[00:29:22.849 --> 00:29:23.450]  It's questioning.
[00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:24.250]  It's researching.
[00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:25.329]  It's promoting liberty.
[00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:26.650]  It's resisting tyranny.

[00:29:59.839 --> 00:30:01.039]  Merry Christmas!
[00:30:05.639 --> 00:30:26.319]  We're good to go.
[00:30:31.609 --> 00:30:34.009]  You know Bill Gates says he wants to reduce the world population.
[00:30:34.289 --> 00:30:37.309]  But he also wants you to take these shots because he really wants you to live longer.
[00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:41.569]  But since they've rolled the shots out, they admit their racial immune system have killed over 30 million people.
[00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:52.230]  And now, for the first time since the Black Plague 550 years ago, the world population is actually dropping and life expectancy is going straight down.
[00:30:53.049 --> 00:30:59.890]  These so-called vaccines have had their definitions changed to just anything they want to put in your body.
[00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:07.130]  Ursula van der Leyen, the head of the unelected European Union.
[00:31:07.369 --> 00:31:19.849]  Oh, they have a ceremonial parliament that's elected, but the EU was set up in 56 with the Treaty of Rome as a trade agreement, and then the governments began transferring their power to the private corporate board.
[00:31:20.069 --> 00:31:20.930]  It's in their charter.
[00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.950]  Look it up.
[00:31:22.069 --> 00:31:30.289]  And it wasn't until 2000 that it officially became the EU, and since then it's been destroying whatever sovereignty was left in those countries while flooding those nations.
[00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:36.930]  With giant third world populations themselves displaced by the COVID lockdowns, the wars, and all the rest of it.
[00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:45.869]  So this is reverse colonization using third world populations as a weapon by the dictatorship of the EU that was first the brainchild of Adolf Hitler.
[00:31:45.869 --> 00:31:48.410]  Look it up, EU's roots to Hitler.
[00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:52.710]  The EU was the brainchild of Hitler and Joseph Goebbels.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.240]  It's insane.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.200]  So look this up for yourself.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:03.559]  Now, she's come out in a big rock star event and said, me and Bill Gates want to vaccinate 500 million children.
[00:32:03.779 --> 00:32:03.960]  Yay!
[00:32:04.519 --> 00:32:05.319]  Take all the shots.
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:06.200]  We love you.
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.700]  We care about you.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.019]  And then meanwhile, we'll show you that clip.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:12.119]  Then there's another clip of her recently.
[00:32:13.609 --> 00:32:19.769]  We're good to go.
[00:32:20.009 --> 00:32:26.150]  We're good to go.
[00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:38.329]  Talking about depopulating the earth as well and saying we're all dead if we don't do it.
[00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:39.970]  The sea levels are gonna rise and all the rest of it.
[00:32:40.069 --> 00:32:46.329]  Even though there's new reports out, the sea levels are actually dropping around the world, like in Alaska and Japan and other places, but just a little bit.
[00:32:46.509 --> 00:32:52.130]  And there are thousand-year-old statues on different beaches around the world, and they're still there.
[00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:56.829]  And there's photos from 150 years ago in New York, Staten Island, the exact same sea level.
[00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:05.630]  But they use this voodoo to scare you, to hate yourself, and believe you're bad, so they can cut off your resources to control you and finally depopulate you.
[00:33:05.769 --> 00:33:17.990]  So, here are the clips, back to back, the newest one, of her and her New World Order, where she comments and commits to vaccinate over 500 million children with Bill Gates.
[00:33:18.349 --> 00:33:29.640]  Then, continuing, Nothing to see here, just Ursula van der Leyen openly acknowledging the depopulation agenda of the Club of Rome inside the EU Parliament.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:42.220]  And then Club of Rome member Dennis Meadows hopes the necessary depopulation of the planet, down to 1 billion, an 87.5% reduction from today's population can occur in a civil way.
[00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:47.730]  Well, they're not doing it in a very civil way, are they, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:50.630]  So here are these clips, back to back to back.
[00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:55.029]  They look up State Department memorandum 200 and Henry Kissinger, and just go from there.
[00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:56.569]  This is official policy.
[00:33:56.849 --> 00:34:05.029]  And they think you and I are so stupid, they're going to do all these soft-kill, slow-kill weapons while they pose as the saviors, and we're not going to wake up to it and organize and stop them.
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.099]  And it really is an IQ test.
[00:34:07.099 --> 00:34:11.860]  If we do let them do this to us and the children, do we really kind of deserve it?
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.760]  Well, the children don't, and God's watching.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.360]  So here are the reports back to back.
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:19.199]  This is just the entrance to the rabbit hole, but it's the total proof of what they're doing.
[00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:22.820]  And this only is the surface of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.219]  These people are self-appointed like their gods.
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:31.920]  Even Plato, the top philosopher, proposed 2,200 years ago in his works, look it up, like in his Republic.
[00:34:32.619 --> 00:34:34.079]  Where he said we should depopulate.
[00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:35.699]  Back then they thought things were overpopulated.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.300]  Then Malthus, 250 years ago.
[00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:39.400]  Look up Plato in depopulation.
[00:34:39.539 --> 00:34:41.260]  Look up Malthus in depopulation.
[00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:45.019]  And then learn who Bill Gates' dad is, the head of Planned Parenthood previously.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:45.900]  All of this.
[00:34:46.079 --> 00:34:48.679]  And ask, are you going to sit here and let them kill you?
[00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:51.590]  Autism rates, 100,000 60 years ago.
[00:34:51.809 --> 00:34:56.110]  Now, 1 in 10. It's getting worse and worse and worse.
[00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:58.050]  They are killing us.
[00:34:58.469 --> 00:35:02.449]  Almost all the polio in the world now, the majority of it, caused by the Bill Gates Foundation.
[00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:03.409]  That's even Reuters.
[00:35:03.789 --> 00:35:05.869]  It's all hiding in plain view.
[00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:08.809]  So here are these people declaring war on you.
[00:35:08.969 --> 00:35:15.389]  They want to depopulate you in one announcement, and then separately over here saying, please take this, we love you, we care about you.
[00:35:16.139 --> 00:35:16.920]  This is sick.
[00:35:17.159 --> 00:35:21.969]  And while they kill us with chronic disease A lot of people just die right away, but others die slowly.
[00:35:21.969 --> 00:35:25.710]  They also then suck all the money out of the economy and wage war.
[00:35:25.969 --> 00:35:27.510]  That's their post-industrial world.
[00:35:27.969 --> 00:35:30.230]  That's, you will owe nothing and be happy because you'll be dead.
[00:35:30.369 --> 00:35:31.389]  That's, eat the bugs.
[00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:32.849]  And that's why you support InfoWars.
[00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:35.369]  That's why you support our sponsor, TheAlexinStore.com.
[00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:42.130]  That's why you go get great products and enrich your life and boost your immune system to counter these people while keeping us on the air to expose their agenda.
[00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:44.489]  We're reaching tens of millions of new people a day, thanks to you.
[00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:45.389]  So thanks for the support.
[00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:49.380]  So here are these diabolical statements back To back to back.
[00:35:49.579 --> 00:35:51.420]  And then after you watch it, research it.
[00:35:51.539 --> 00:35:53.019]  It's a lot worse than even telling you.
[00:35:53.139 --> 00:35:55.059]  And then share this report.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.900]  Because humanity is waking up and we will override this globalist death cult.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.980]  A better world also means a healthier world.
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:07.699]  And vaccination is our best chance to do this.
[00:36:08.639 --> 00:36:13.420]  Vaccines have saved millions of lives in the past 50 years.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:18.800]  But right now, millions of children are still at risk.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.500]  They need vaccines.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:26.739]  So we must continue to support vaccination around the world.
[00:36:27.019 --> 00:36:36.659]  And today, I am pleased to pledge $290 million for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
[00:36:38.289 --> 00:36:40.750]  Each child should be protected.
[00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.130]  And more will come.
[00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:53.969]  Together with Gavi, we have the goal to vaccinate 500 million children by 2030. Europe will do its fair share.
[00:36:54.449 --> 00:36:56.510]  You can count on us, my friends.
[00:36:57.679 --> 00:37:09.420]  Indeed, if we look back, a little over 50 years ago, the Club of Rome and a group of MIT researchers published the Limits of Growth report.
[00:37:10.079 --> 00:37:17.699]  It mapped the interaction between population growth, the economy, and the environment.
[00:37:18.579 --> 00:37:22.679]  And it came 50 years ago to a drastic conclusion.
[00:37:23.519 --> 00:37:26.800]  Stop economic and population growth.
[00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:30.349]  Or else our planet will not cope.
[00:37:30.869 --> 00:37:40.769]  So far, globally, you are so far above the population and the consumption levels which can be supported by this planet that I know in one way or another it's going to come back down.
[00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:42.750]  So I don't hope to avoid that.
[00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:52.530]  I hope that it can occur in a civil way.
[00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:58.050]  And I mean civil in a Special way.
[00:37:58.289 --> 00:37:59.010]  Peaceful.
[00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:12.650]  Peace doesn't mean that everybody's happy, but it means that conflict isn't solved through violence, through force, but rather in other ways.
[00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:14.449]  And so that's what I hope for.
[00:38:14.849 --> 00:38:22.170]  The planet can support something like a billion people.
[00:38:24.429 --> 00:38:30.550]  Maybe 2 billion, depending on how much liberty and how much material consumption you want to have.
[00:38:30.869 --> 00:38:36.130]  If you want more liberty and more consumption, you have to have fewer people.
[00:38:36.769 --> 00:38:39.190]  And conversely, you can have more people.
[00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:40.909]  I mean, we could even have...
[00:38:41.909 --> 00:38:46.969]  Eight or nine billion, probably, if we have a very strong dictatorship, which is smart.
[00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:50.230]  Unfortunately, you never have smart dictatorships.
[00:38:50.369 --> 00:38:50.869]  They're always stupid.
[00:38:51.289 --> 00:38:55.349]  But if you had a smart dictatorship and a low standard of living, you can have it.
[00:38:55.909 --> 00:39:00.409]  But we want to have freedom and we want to have a high sentence, so we're going to have a billion people.
[00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:03.369]  And we're now at seven, so we have to get back down.
[00:39:03.849 --> 00:39:06.670]  I hope that this can be slow, relatively slow.
[00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:21.309]  And that it can be done in a way which is relatively equal, you know, so that people share the experience and they don't have a few rich, you know, trying to force everybody else to deal with it.
[00:39:21.409 --> 00:39:22.250]  So those are my hopes.
[00:39:22.489 --> 00:39:25.010]  What do you see as the biggest challenges in conservation?
[00:39:25.929 --> 00:39:28.489]  The growing human population.
[00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:32.429]  Because where we are, there's nothing else.
[00:39:33.869 --> 00:39:35.989]  And do you have views about what should be done about that?
[00:39:37.309 --> 00:39:37.989]  Don't you guess?
[00:39:38.369 --> 00:39:41.690]  The D-Tap, the Hib, the polio.
[00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.349]  And how old are they at this stage?
[00:39:45.429 --> 00:39:46.010]  Four months?
[00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:46.590]  Four months.
[00:39:47.429 --> 00:39:50.750]  I mean, it's very hard to see it.
[00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:51.250]  Yeah.
[00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.889]  Two beautiful boys' lives destroyed.
[00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:54.210]  Yep.
[00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:57.269]  Do they, I mean, you've just been sitting staring.
[00:39:57.489 --> 00:39:59.050]  Is this what their life is like?
[00:39:59.289 --> 00:39:59.809]  What can they do?
[00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:01.369]  I mean, it's always a piece of blood.
[00:40:01.809 --> 00:40:02.190]  Yeah, no, this is it.
[00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:04.130]  I've never seen anything like this.
[00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:04.849]  This is it.
[00:40:06.039 --> 00:40:07.679]  Two-year-old, two-month-olds.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.099]  You know, they're frozen in time.
[00:40:10.679 --> 00:40:12.280]  The shots froze them in time.
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.539]  Let's just say a two-month well baby visit.
[00:40:14.639 --> 00:40:17.119]  There's a DPT. That's three shots, three antigens.
[00:40:17.519 --> 00:40:23.019]  Hib, Pravnar, Hep B, polio, rotavirus, six shots, eight antigens.
[00:40:23.119 --> 00:40:29.900]  Other people who couldn't even come onto the bus, who had to stay outside the bus, and we had to move all of our equipment outside and interview them there.
[00:40:30.159 --> 00:40:34.119]  We are going to stop this, because this, see?
[00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:36.260]  She knows.
[00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:38.079]  It's all right, Kelsey.
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.000]  Children's health defense got your back.
[00:40:41.659 --> 00:40:48.500]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, great report there from Alex Jones exposing the globalists and their agenda for depopulation.
[00:40:48.619 --> 00:40:49.760]  I mean, they say it themselves.
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:53.280]  Kamala Harris was found saying it as well, and then she walked it back later.
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.380]  But we know that it was a Freudian slip.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:11.460]  She said outwardly that what she had spoken about privately in meetings with bureaucrats and Other staffers and lobbyists and special interests, they want to depopulate the planet because they want to eradicate those from third world countries,
[00:41:11.619 --> 00:41:22.980]  second world countries who are a burden on the state, and then they want to enslave everyone else who has any value or skills and subjugate them under a new AI one world government.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.940]  This is the nature of power throughout history.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.760]  It is the nature of power to consolidate, conglomerate power.
[00:41:32.269 --> 00:41:43.409]  Those with power seek two things, to maintain their power or to expand it so naturally they have conspired together in order to establish a political class that transcends all borders.
[00:41:47.489 --> 00:41:49.530]  And that's why we have to elect people like Donald Trump.
[00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:50.110]  He's not perfect.
[00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:51.289]  He's gonna make mistakes, no doubt.
[00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:56.670]  That's why we have to support people like Marc Andreessen and support people like Elon Musk.
[00:41:57.409 --> 00:42:05.210]  When they're trying to do things to fight back against this seemingly insurmountable foe, we do have a new statement from Donald Trump.
[00:42:05.369 --> 00:42:09.969]  He did come out and make a one minute statement about the recent drone phenomena.
[00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:12.150]  Let's watch that and unpack it on the other side.
[00:42:13.429 --> 00:42:14.409]  Good to see you.
[00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:18.210]  Can you comment on the drones that are flying around New Jersey ports?
[00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:20.769]  It seems like the American people have a big disk.
[00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:23.349]  The government knows what is happening.
[00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:28.630]  Our military knows where they took off from.
[00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:32.190]  If it's a garage, they can go right into that garage.
[00:42:32.449 --> 00:42:35.130]  They know where it came from and where it went.
[00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:38.210]  And for some reason, they don't want to comment.
[00:42:38.809 --> 00:42:41.030]  And I think they'd be better off saying what it is.
[00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:43.750]  Our military knows and our president knows.
[00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:47.030]  And for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense.
[00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:51.730]  I can't imagine it's the enemy, because if it was the enemy, they'd blast it out.
[00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:53.610]  Even if they were late, they'd blast it out.
[00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:56.650]  Something strange is going on.
[00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.489]  For some reason, they don't want to tell the people.
[00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:00.610]  And they should, because the people are really...
[00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:02.869]  I mean, they happen to be over Bedminster.
[00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:07.789]  They're very close to Bedminster.
[00:43:07.889 --> 00:43:10.010]  I think maybe I won't spend the weekend in Bedminster.
[00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:12.590]  I've decided to cancel my trip.
[00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.030]  Have you received an intelligence briefing on the drones?
[00:43:15.309 --> 00:43:16.730]  I don't want to comment on that.
[00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:20.210]  Well, there you have it, folks.
[00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:22.590]  Donald Trump's first comments on the drones.
[00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:24.130]  Now, we do have breaking news on the desk.
[00:43:24.289 --> 00:43:25.949]  I'm going to show you clip 44 in a second here.
[00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:29.250]  Madison police are investigating a shooting at Abundant Life Christian School.
[00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:32.030]  Shooting was reported just before 11 a.m.
[00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:34.670]  at the school at 4901 East Buckeye Road.
[00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:36.550]  Multiple injuries were reported.
[00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:40.230]  The scene is considered active, and the public is asked to avoid the area.
[00:43:40.369 --> 00:43:45.530]  Roads around the 4900 block of Buckeye Road will be blocked off as law enforcement investigate.
[00:43:45.809 --> 00:43:47.070]  This is a breaking story.
[00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:51.929]  Let's watch clip 44. We are hearing from Madison police at this hour.
[00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:54.150]  This is officially happening, folks.
[00:43:54.329 --> 00:43:56.550]  We have multiple injuries that have been reported.
[00:43:56.989 --> 00:43:58.329]  Police are in the area.
[00:43:58.329 --> 00:44:00.449]  We have obviously heard of those casualties.
[00:44:00.869 --> 00:44:05.550]  This seemed considered very much active, and the public is asked to avoid the area.
[00:44:05.989 --> 00:44:08.030]  Again, this is on Madison's east side.
[00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:09.949]  This is an abundant life Christian school.
[00:44:10.349 --> 00:44:12.829]  All right, folks, so another Christian school being shot up.
[00:44:12.869 --> 00:44:15.829]  I hope it's not Deadly.
[00:44:15.909 --> 00:44:16.909]  I hope people are going to be okay.
[00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:17.670]  I know there's injuries.
[00:44:17.849 --> 00:44:18.829]  I hope everyone's going to be okay.
[00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:23.230]  But the first thing that comes to mind when you hear about a Christian school shooting is the Nashville school shooting.
[00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:41.070]  And I wonder if it's part of this leftist SSRI, brainwashing, psychological, MKUltra, Luigi Mangione-esque cult that's been cultivated in For years and years now,
[00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.869]  leading to this violence.
[00:44:41.989 --> 00:44:46.389]  So they use things like school shootings as an excuse to ramp up gun regulation.
[00:44:46.389 --> 00:44:56.090]  They use things like unidentified flying objects as an excuse to ramp up regulation around individual drone use.
[00:44:57.769 --> 00:45:04.170]  And now they're using things like the development of artificial intelligence to ramp up regulation around artificial intelligence.
[00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:19.210]  Every time something new is innovated, every time something good happens, every time individuals create successful businesses, it seems like the government finds a way to regulate around that, to create a fence around all of those rights, liberties, successes and values.
[00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:23.889]  And now we have reports.
[00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:32.309]  Autonomous AI may have to be unplugged before it's too late, says ex-Google CEO. This is a great report from Raw Egg Nationalist on Infowars.com.
[00:45:33.449 --> 00:45:43.630]  We're soon going to be able to have computers running on their own, deciding what they want to do, said Schmidt, a longtime prophet of the dangers of AI during an appearance on ABC's This Week on Sunday.
[00:45:44.289 --> 00:45:50.110]  Donald Trump has indicated his desire to make the U.S. the world's foremost player in AI while acknowledging the difficulties the technology could bring.
[00:45:50.329 --> 00:45:55.809]  Here is clip number 17 of Marc Andreessen talking about Google's new quantum computing capabilities.
[00:45:57.579 --> 00:46:18.519]  The most enticing thing of what they said, which is one of these things where you think about it and then you decide you have to stop thinking about it because you'll never think about anything else again, is that in theory, the lab demonstration that they have is doing a computation that the entire universe that we live in,
[00:46:18.579 --> 00:46:30.840]  if it was converted entirely to just a giant computer, If every atom in our universe was turned into a giant computer, that computer could not solve that problem before the universe ultimately dies of heat death.
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:44.559]  And the implication of that is that the computation therefore must be spread out across many other parallel universes, which is therefore proof that there are many other parallel universes.
[00:46:45.619 --> 00:46:47.280]  Oh, interesting.
[00:46:48.489 --> 00:46:53.590]  Right, in other words, if you weren't able to spread this computation out across many parallel universes, it could not have been done.
[00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:55.309]  Therefore, there must be many parallel universes.
[00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:57.250]  Therefore, we do actually live in a multiverse.
[00:46:57.829 --> 00:47:01.429]  And there are actually billions or uncountable numbers of parallel realities.
[00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:03.269]  It's insane.
[00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:04.750]  It's insane.
[00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:07.269]  So here we are in a multiverse.
[00:47:07.469 --> 00:47:08.789]  There are parallel realities.
[00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:12.110]  Mathematics, quantum mechanics, life is fiery with its beauty.
[00:47:13.679 --> 00:47:27.860]  And the only institutions and people that have access to this technology that can transcend the boundaries of our own universe and engage on a quantum level to compute at a massive scale, unprecedented scale, are the Googles and the open AIs and the government.
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:36.079]  AI could very soon pose an existential threat to mankind and might have to be unplugged for good, according to former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.
[00:47:38.489 --> 00:47:54.829]  Schmidt and other important tech figures and CEOs aren't worried so much about consumer AI systems like ChatGPT, which has improved exponentially in recent years, but more complicated artificial general intelligence, AGI, which could perhaps have real sentience and develop conscious motives that differ from those of their human masters.
[00:47:55.369 --> 00:48:17.849]  And if you think about the human mind as something that exists only within this universe, then that means by definition an artificial general intelligence powered by quantum computing is Would be impossible, physically impossible for a human brain to compete with without supplemental technology installed on the brain.
[00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:24.590]  We are tapping in to what the ancients would have called a spiritual realm.
[00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:29.190]  We're tapping in to a transcendent dimension.
[00:48:31.469 --> 00:48:46.800]  Using this technology for massive computing and the implications are Inspiring and terrifying all at the same time, but if we do not democratize this technology, then it will be impossible for us, we, as individuals,
[00:48:47.119 --> 00:49:04.280]  to compete with the motives We're good to go.
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.559]  All of your social media behavior is tracked.
[00:49:14.679 --> 00:49:15.840]  All of your browsing history is tracked.
[00:49:16.239 --> 00:49:17.659]  They know everything about you.
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:21.960]  There were studies that came out 10 years ago that Facebook knows more about you than your best friends.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.320]  Facebook knows when you use the restroom every day.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:42.820]  They know everything about you and you feed that data And all your other demographic information into an artificial general intelligence system and you give that artificial general intelligence the task of converting a person say to be a leftist Marxist,
[00:49:43.099 --> 00:49:48.820]  it's going to find a way to interact with you such that you are converted.
[00:49:50.809 --> 00:50:09.150]  If you think we have a cult problem right now with the likes of TikTok and Instagram and these algorithms manipulating our children because of the content that the algorithms choose to show our children, just imagine when the artificial intelligence isn't just showing content strategically to them, but making the content that's ideal for the stated objective.
[00:50:09.469 --> 00:50:15.309]  And they're going to do things like in the name of efficiency, come out and say that we need to have artificial intelligence in all of our schools.
[00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:31.670]  They're gonna have it run all of our investing, all of our healthcare, all of our government agencies, and then suddenly we are dependent on this multiverse technology that we do not understand to manage humanity itself.
[00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:36.309]  And I'm not opposed to technological innovations.
[00:50:36.449 --> 00:50:41.750]  I think technological innovation is inevitable, and if you fight against it, then you're clinging to the past.
[00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:43.750]  It's like fighting against the tide coming in.
[00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:48.869]  You have to find a way to ride the wave instead of fighting against it, but you have to democratize this technology.
[00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:56.510]  We cannot allow the government to have one universal artificial intelligence that becomes the Skynet over all of humanity.
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:03.980]  I'm going to show you one more clip of Mark Andreessen talking about how he's a volunteer for Doge.
[00:51:04.099 --> 00:51:07.579]  This is clip number 16. Former founder, I believe, of Netscape.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.719]  He's got a major background in big tech.
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:10.719]  He understands all this stuff.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:24.119]  Let's watch clip number 16. Okay, well speaking of sort of the next administration and the government, some have reported that you are considering in the running, I don't know what the right word is, to join DOGE. Is this true at all?
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.199]  I'm an unpaid volunteer.
[00:51:26.539 --> 00:51:31.039]  You're an unpaid intern for the new Department of Government Efficiency.
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:32.400]  Yes.
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:34.039]  What do you think it's going to do?
[00:51:35.239 --> 00:51:37.019]  There's basically two big parts to it.
[00:51:37.119 --> 00:51:45.659]  One is they're going to do a top-to-bottom review of government spending, and they're going to go cut as much cost as they possibly can, and they have a whole theory and strategy on that.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:50.119]  And then in conjunction with that and related to that, they're going to do the same thing for regulations.
[00:51:51.059 --> 00:51:56.300]  So they're going to basically do a top-to-bottom review of what we call the regulatory state or the administrative state.
[00:51:56.590 --> 00:52:08.269]  And the connective tissue there that they don't talk about in public is, I think, actually quite important, which is, like, a lot of the reaction of the doge from, like, institutional Washington is like, well, that's impossible.
[00:52:08.269 --> 00:52:09.090]  You can't do that.
[00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:10.710]  There are all these laws and statutes and regulations.
[00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:12.530]  There's this thing.
[00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:13.030]  There's this thing.
[00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:13.429]  There's this thing.
[00:52:13.489 --> 00:52:14.510]  You know the term impoundment?
[00:52:14.949 --> 00:52:15.269]  Yes.
[00:52:15.969 --> 00:52:23.800]  Yeah, so impoundment for those— Okay, so impoundment normally means, as a civilian, it normally means like your car gets impounded.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:28.320]  There's a different use of the word in the context of government spending.
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:38.099]  Impoundment is the principle in law today that the president has to go to Congress to get money for a program.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.619]  The president is not allowed to either overspend or underspend.
[00:52:45.279 --> 00:52:45.639]  What?
[00:52:45.639 --> 00:52:49.940]  So the president is obligated to spend the money whether he thinks it's a good idea or not.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:51.539]  That's insane.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.340]  On every government program.
[00:52:54.619 --> 00:52:55.460]  Look up impoundment.
[00:52:55.519 --> 00:53:01.840]  The president is required by law to spend every money allocated by every dollar allocated by Congress, whether he thinks it's a good idea to or not.
[00:53:02.099 --> 00:53:06.659]  And so the president literally, like legally, quote unquote, today can't actually save money.
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.139]  He can't say, I'm just not going to spend on this.
[00:53:08.219 --> 00:53:08.860]  He has to spend the money.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.239]  So this is like how crazy and like weird the thing has.
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:14.840]  By the way, the Constitution, there's a very good argument that's been litigated for a long time.
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:16.380]  The Constitution does not actually say this.
[00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:19.889]  The Constitution says the president needs to go get money from Congress.
[00:53:19.909 --> 00:53:21.070]  It doesn't say that he has to spend the money.
[00:53:21.429 --> 00:53:23.869]  So this is the kind of constitutional question.
[00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:28.650]  We've been living under a regime in which there's a lot of these things that have been taken for granted that are probably not constitutional.
[00:53:28.889 --> 00:53:30.630]  So that's one of the things that...
[00:53:31.139 --> 00:53:32.159]  I'm sure it's going to get looked at.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.440]  Just because you're brilliant in one area doesn't mean you're brilliant in another.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:38.280]  All right, folks, we've got an incredible guest coming up on the other side, Britt T. Griffith.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:41.800]  Britt was born and raised in Southern California and is no stranger to show business.
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:46.699]  Having worked in Hollywood from a young age, you may recognize him as a host of Ghost Hunters years ago.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:56.579]  One of Britt's lifelong hobbies is investigating claims of the paranormal, which led him to a friendship with Jason In 2008, Jason reached out to Britt and asked if he would like to assist on an important case they had coming up.
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:02.280]  Britt said yes and now found himself working all over the world in front of the camera investigating the paranormal.

[00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:25.250]  Unfortunately...
[00:55:26.449 --> 00:55:30.269]  This will solve all our problems, but they only made 2,000 in this limited edition.
[00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:36.369]  But it'll go a long way towards our lawsuits and funding our operations and the new network and everything else and keeping InfoWars on it.
[00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:37.210]  That continues.
[00:55:37.389 --> 00:55:38.210]  Look at this bad boy.
[00:55:38.329 --> 00:55:41.050]  The 1984 versus 1776 coin.
[00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.869]  I designed it.
[00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:46.789]  There's only 2,000 of these bad boys at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:48.289]  And they are a fundraiser.
[00:55:48.389 --> 00:55:49.769]  They are a piece of history.

[00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:57.039]  2,000 of these.

[00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:23.349]  That is our main sponsor with the Alex Jones Network and everything we're doing going into the future.
[00:56:23.489 --> 00:56:26.269]  So get this amazing coin now.

[00:56:40.579 --> 00:56:42.940]  And on the other side, it's got the Gadsden flag, don't tread on me.
[00:56:43.539 --> 00:56:46.039]  1776, another one with Alex Jones, yours truly on it.
[00:56:46.179 --> 00:56:49.079]  The answer to 1904 is 1776 with the Gadsden flag.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.619]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God on the other side.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.480]  And there's some other great challenge coins as well.
[00:56:53.659 --> 00:56:56.679]  At thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:58.980]  Now, this is even more exciting.
[00:56:59.199 --> 00:57:00.239]  They surprised me with this.
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:01.340]  I just learned this morning.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:05.699]  So it's in the mail from Arkansas where their factory is and their shipping department and all that.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.019]  The big lead that owns and runs thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:57:08.199 --> 00:57:13.179]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump on a Stump, 1995. Everybody loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:16.260]  This is Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:18.280]  Oh, my daughter loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:20.059]  We play with him and do all sorts of stuff.
[00:57:20.779 --> 00:57:23.119]  Catapult around the house, play with the cats, play with them.
[00:57:23.519 --> 00:57:26.860]  We probably got 15 of those Elf on a Shelf, both little elf village in the backyard.
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:27.699]  We have a lot of fun.
[00:57:28.119 --> 00:57:31.659]  She puts Christmas tree lights on these little trees we got in the backyard.
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:33.739]  Oh my gosh, I've got to have this.
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:34.559]  And I already called them.
[00:57:34.679 --> 00:57:36.699]  I said, I want 10 set aside for me.
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:37.599]  So that means there's...
[00:57:39.210 --> 00:57:41.090]  1,900 and something of these.
[00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:43.769]  And I'm telling you, this is going to sell out today.
[00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:46.190]  Why they didn't get 20,000 of them, I don't know.
[00:57:46.329 --> 00:57:47.449]  All my problems would be solved.
[00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:48.670]  We would have plenty of fun.
[00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:50.429]  This baby is amazing.
[00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:55.789]  Everybody needs to have this original Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.

[00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:41.369]  The internet's freaking out right now.
[00:58:42.429 --> 00:58:44.670]  There's viral videos everywhere of this show.
[00:58:45.469 --> 00:58:48.409]  On Instagram, on Twitter, on TikTok, on everywhere.
[00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:51.230]  There's even articles about abandon.
[00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:52.550]  You can't allow Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:54.590]  I mean, these old clips are even worse than his new ones.
[00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:57.170]  That's how it works.
[00:58:57.409 --> 00:58:59.010]  I'll be the ghost of the machine forever.
[00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:00.710]  And so we're all our listeners and viewers.
[00:59:02.769 --> 00:59:05.269]  Because the worse it gets, the more people remember what we said.
[00:59:05.489 --> 00:59:06.750]  That's the little secret.
[00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:18.010]  Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents.
[00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:24.110]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and the forced vaccines.
[00:59:24.659 --> 00:59:30.699]  The hell we're already living in that's just gonna continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:33.460]  But that story is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:59:33.579 --> 00:59:36.820]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:40.139]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:52.440]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[00:59:52.619 --> 00:59:55.739]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[00:59:55.940 --> 01:00:13.170]  I pray to God, I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength And the will to be able to face this harm and to give me the strength to carry on because I know why a lot of you don't wanna look at this information and just wanna comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards and I'm a liar.
[01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:17.130]  I know why, because it's scary.
[01:00:21.429 --> 01:00:23.510]  You're not gonna be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[01:00:25.809 --> 01:00:28.289]  You're not gonna be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[01:00:28.289 --> 01:00:32.860]  You're not gonna be able to just You know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[01:00:33.599 --> 01:00:47.059]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you, mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually.
[01:00:47.539 --> 01:00:57.280]  The only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[01:00:58.619 --> 01:01:03.940]  Once you've faced this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life.
[01:01:04.219 --> 01:01:05.719]  It should take over your life.
[01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:07.280]  I mean, what else?
[01:01:07.519 --> 01:01:08.780]  What else could it do?
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:21.199]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the controlled corporate media has been putting out for decades ahead of their open unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[01:01:23.019 --> 01:01:26.480]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[01:01:26.579 --> 01:01:34.219]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.599]  Win, lose, or draw, you need to choose a side.
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.340]  Old Cliffs are even worse than his new ones.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:41.900]  That's how it works.
[01:01:42.119 --> 01:01:43.800]  I'll be the ghost of the machine forever.
[01:01:44.019 --> 01:01:45.500]  And so are all our listeners and viewers.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.960]  Because the worse it gets, the more people remember what we said.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.480]  That's the little secret.
[01:02:02.099 --> 01:02:22.760]  I vow to you right now, I vow to you today, That as far as all of these people who have attacked Infowars are concerned, who have illegally attacked Infowars, I'm not talking about random people who speak out against Infowars, I believe in freedom of speech, but those who have maliciously and intentionally engaged in fraud to bring this operation down.
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:26.719]  I will burn thine house upon thee with fire.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:31.260]  I will burn thine house upon thee with fire.
[01:02:31.579 --> 01:02:32.380]  Listen again.
[01:02:32.699 --> 01:02:36.179]  I will burn thine house upon thee with fire.
[01:02:38.090 --> 01:02:41.590]  Alright folks, on the other side of this break we've got Britt T. Griffith joining us.
[01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:47.969]  Make sure you follow him on X at Britt T. Griffith, former host of Ghost Hunters, expert in all things paranormal.
[01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:54.809]  And we're going to talk about this UFO stuff as well as unpack an amazing report from Alex Jones.
[01:02:54.929 --> 01:02:56.750]  We're going to play that on the other side of this break.
[01:02:56.809 --> 01:02:57.550]  Make sure you stay tuned.
[01:02:57.670 --> 01:03:01.389]  Make sure you visit thealexjonesstore.com right now and be the reason we are still on the air.
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:13.500]  Let your lead out.
[01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:40.949]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, the host today of The Alex Jones Show.
[01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:42.909]  We've got an incredible guest joining us now.
[01:03:42.989 --> 01:03:44.289]  Your calls in the next hour.
[01:03:44.469 --> 01:03:49.929]  Britt T. Griffith was born and raised in Southern California and is no stranger to show business, having worked in Hollywood from a young age.
[01:03:50.150 --> 01:04:00.250]  One of Britt's lifelong hobbies is investigating claims of the paranormal, which led him to a friendship with Jason Hawes in 2008. Jason reached out to Britt and asked if he would like to assist on an important case they had coming up.
[01:04:00.329 --> 01:04:04.289]  Britt said yes and found himself working all over the world in front of the camera investigating the paranormal.
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:11.760]  Since his work on Ghost Hunters, Britt makes appearances at multiple guest events all over the country where he lectures and leads paranormal investigations.
[01:04:12.119 --> 01:04:14.820]  Follow him on X at Britt T. Griffith.
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:17.019]  Britt, it's an honor and a pleasure to have you, my friend.
[01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:20.150]  Chase, it's nice to see you and thank you.
[01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:27.050]  But the first thing I want to get out of the way is there's one thing we've learned over the last, well, 30 years of Alex Jones, maybe 50. I don't want to age him too much.
[01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:31.329]  But just really the last 10 years is that experts don't know what they're talking about.
[01:04:31.610 --> 01:04:37.550]  So please do not accuse me of being a journalist because they're scum or an expert because they're dumb.
[01:04:37.690 --> 01:04:43.409]  But I am a guy that spent probably 25,000 hours chasing the paranormal.
[01:04:43.409 --> 01:04:46.570]  So I do have some expertise in it, I guess.
[01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:50.489]  But mostly I'm just a common sense guy who looks at stuff and tries to debunk it.
[01:04:50.889 --> 01:04:51.210]  Absolutely.
[01:04:51.409 --> 01:04:52.710]  Well, we've got this new report from Alex.
[01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:53.510]  I haven't even seen it yet.
[01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:54.809]  He just sent it in and want us to air it.
[01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:56.429]  Let's run this report from Alex.
[01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:59.210]  It's just a couple of minutes long and then we'll unpack it together on the other side.
[01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.550]  Go ahead.
[01:05:02.409 --> 01:05:13.849]  I'm seeing a ton of videos going viral on X. And other places that show commercial airliners coming in for landing at night with their landing lights on.
[01:05:13.949 --> 01:05:15.869]  It looks like a UFO. People are panicking.
[01:05:16.809 --> 01:05:23.730]  I'm seeing people freak out over just private people's drones and the government sitting there saying they don't know what this is.
[01:05:23.809 --> 01:05:25.230]  It's just to add all the hysteria.
[01:05:25.409 --> 01:05:27.190]  I'm about to show you a great example of this.
[01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:37.519]  Last night, Over the Pentagon, there are whippoorwills, which are birds that live all over North America that will get in searchlights or get above shopping mall lights and eat the bugs.
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:40.280]  And we'll show you a picture of them right here.
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:45.940]  And people think that that's, again, UFOs or something.
[01:05:47.099 --> 01:05:53.940]  This is a major psyop that a lot of world leaders over the last few decades will be going back 56 years.
[01:05:55.179 --> 01:06:00.500]  And documents about how they would use a fake alien invasion as a big unifying factor for the Earth.
[01:06:00.659 --> 01:06:05.219]  They could also use an asteroid coming in as a pretext to unify the Earth, stopping the asteroid.
[01:06:06.039 --> 01:06:10.460]  Obviously wars, viruses, that's all the different UN documents like disease acts.
[01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:13.119]  But the fact that this is all happening right now is no mistake.
[01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:17.900]  And then Trump said last week he doesn't know what's going on, shoot him down if there are other restricted areas.
[01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:25.269]  But the word is, a lot of these crafts can't be picked up by sensors to be shot down, and that's the stuff that's 30 or 40 years advanced.
[01:06:25.469 --> 01:06:36.900]  And we know that the government and the major skunk works, aeronautics companies have, so we're really living in like the year 2070. That's just a dead reckoning estimation of where the technology's really at.
[01:06:37.679 --> 01:06:41.000]  So people need to stop being hysterical, thinking everything is aliens.
[01:06:41.659 --> 01:06:42.679]  This is a human.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:47.440]  People should be very concerned, though, about what they're about to pull, what they're about to stage, so everybody can see it and feel it.
[01:06:47.519 --> 01:06:48.219]  Something big's coming.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:52.639]  Keep tracking all this live here on air, but here's the footage over the Pentagon of the birds eating bugs.
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.519]  So yeah, here's the footage, Brett.
[01:06:55.019 --> 01:06:59.599]  And it looks like a beam from Independence Day with Will Smith.
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:02.079]  But those are just birds flying there in that beam.
[01:07:02.079 --> 01:07:06.059]  And the way the light is reflecting off of them makes them look like unidentified flying objects.
[01:07:06.059 --> 01:07:10.480]  You've been in the business of exploring the supernatural and the paranormal.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:21.079]  And correct me if I'm wrong, I don't want to speak for you, but I imagine that over the years you found a bunch of instances where something could be explained away and sometimes not, right?
[01:07:21.639 --> 01:07:23.960]  And so what's going on with this UFO stuff?
[01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:27.320]  Well, so yes, correct.
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:39.119]  Like when I was doing the paranormal thing, now when I was on the show Ghost Hunters, it's a little different because we had a big budget and we hopscotch to all the hotspots and we had teams that were local that were going in and pre-investigating.
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:45.500]  So the show had a much higher positive rate for ghostly activity because of their budget.
[01:07:45.679 --> 01:07:54.340]  But locally, you should be able to debunk 99.999% of ghosts, aliens, demons.
[01:07:54.679 --> 01:07:56.860]  You should be able to debunk it all because it's extremely rare.
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:58.440]  Are aliens here?
[01:07:58.619 --> 01:08:06.380]  I mean, I don't know for a fact, but I mean, I would be dumb to think that we're the smartest thing in the universe, but they could be here.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:15.280]  Watching those birds, the sun breaking through the clouds, is there a little bit of after effects going on there to enhance the sunbeam and darken everything?
[01:08:15.619 --> 01:08:16.020]  Absolutely.
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:18.020]  You've seen that done before, so it could be.
[01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:27.739]  My problem is, When this started, in the beginning, when it was a little here, a little there, and it was all being hush-hushed or just not covered, that was more the legitimate stuff that really got me curious.
[01:08:28.119 --> 01:08:29.979]  Today, I don't believe anything I see.
[01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:32.779]  Nothing I see because everybody wants the clickbait.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.380]  Everybody wants the engagement farm.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:38.420]  Everybody is just trying to get their 10 minutes of fame or whatever and make some money.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.920]  So everything today is probably BS, is probably messed with.
[01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:48.409]  I always go back to one question, Chase, and it's, what do they want?
[01:08:48.529 --> 01:08:50.210]  What are they trying to do, meaning our government?
[01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:55.189]  Are they trying to get more of our civil rights or our liberties away from us?
[01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:57.670]  Are they trying to do a 9-11 Patriot Act thing?
[01:08:57.810 --> 01:09:00.149]  And that's where I think this is going now, personally.
[01:09:00.949 --> 01:09:03.449]  But on the paranormal front, it's extremely rare.
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:10.180]  99.99% of the stuff that we see is debunkable if you look at it with a critical eye.
[01:09:10.539 --> 01:09:10.899]  Absolutely.
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:22.279]  Well, and that's one of the reasons why I wanted to have you on, Britt, not just because I love hanging out with you and we go way back, but because you're someone who has actually witnessed, captured, seen, experienced incredible things.
[01:09:22.279 --> 01:09:27.300]  You've showed me some of the footage of doors opening and balloons moving in and out and just bizarre stuff.
[01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:37.430]  I know that you believe that this paranormal stuff, supernatural stuff can happen or at least the inexplicable can happen in a way that you can't rationally explain even upon further investigation.
[01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:50.710]  And so to have you on to come out and look at this, a lot of people in the business that you've been in with your background would want this to be an example of a UFO because it's like, see, I told you, it's all real.
[01:09:50.829 --> 01:09:51.229]  See, I told you.
[01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:54.750]  And to have you come on and say, this seems like a PSYOP, I think is really powerful.
[01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:59.670]  Yeah, and my general rule of thumb, because the number one question I always get is, well, do you believe in ghosts?
[01:09:59.890 --> 01:10:03.109]  And my answer is, I've seen stuff I can't explain.
[01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:04.689]  Is it ghosts?
[01:10:04.930 --> 01:10:07.850]  Is it Uncle Fred hanging out in the basement doing weird stuff?
[01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:11.289]  Is it aliens that are observing us and watching us?
[01:10:11.329 --> 01:10:14.069]  I mean, I don't know about you, Chase, but when I was a kid, I had ant farms.
[01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:17.609]  And when they would get done building their homes, what was the first thing I would do as a kid?
[01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:19.529]  I would knock on that window and screw with them.
[01:10:19.729 --> 01:10:27.529]  So what if, you know, what if the Vulcans are up there watching us and every now and then you got a comedic scientist who's going to watch them and screw with these humans and they make something happen.
[01:10:27.569 --> 01:10:28.229]  So it could be that.
[01:10:28.409 --> 01:10:31.989]  It could just be, you know, different planes blending together.
[01:10:32.250 --> 01:10:34.069]  You know, the whole harmonics and frequency thing.
[01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:39.010]  The only reason that I can hold this microphone, stand here on the floor, is that we all vibrate at the same frequency.
[01:10:39.149 --> 01:10:43.569]  What if something's just a couple frequencies off and every now and then it blends and we cross paths and we see each other.
[01:10:43.710 --> 01:10:45.449]  So there's a lot of things that could be.
[01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:52.220]  All I know is I do not have the evidence to say that That our spirit stays on this earth and wanders.
[01:10:52.359 --> 01:10:53.260]  I don't have that evidence.
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:55.380]  But I also don't have the evidence to absolutely debunk it.
[01:10:55.539 --> 01:10:58.319]  So I just say I see stuff I can't explain.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.180]  But you're right, Chase.
[01:11:00.319 --> 01:11:01.460]  People want that.
[01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:05.060]  I don't know what the right word is.
[01:11:05.239 --> 01:11:07.520]  The look at me factor, I call it.
[01:11:07.579 --> 01:11:08.239]  Look what I found.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:08.840]  Look what I got.
[01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:24.090]  That weird narcissism or just the desire because they have daddy, mommy issues, whatever going on in their life, they're trying to fill a hole, that they will put fake stuff up that they know is fake just to get that attention, not realizing that it spins other people out to do crazy things.
[01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:32.960]  Well, undoubtedly, they're We're good to go.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:57.180]  But what's interesting to me about this particularly is, I don't know, I don't see a lot of people talking about this, but a couple of years ago, there was a lot of teasing of these UAPs.
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:05.659]  There were congressional hearings, there were whistleblowers coming out saying that we think these beings might be interdimensional and co-located with the Earth, right?
[01:12:06.119 --> 01:12:13.600]  And that kind of went away for a while after all these whistleblowers came out, and now we see this unprecedented drone activity.
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:18.739]  I almost wonder if I think?
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:38.340]  That, you know, had, you know, in my mind, they just had their best, our best interest in their heart to do best.
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.460]  I would go down that rabbit hole.
[01:12:40.699 --> 01:12:42.500]  They were just trying to promise to get us ready for it.
[01:12:42.899 --> 01:12:58.100]  Today, with what we know, with the stuff that Alex has dug up, that you've dug up, that the Bonginos, the Pools, even the Young Turks, for that matter, all the stuff that has just come out and that has crushed our trust and faith in our institutions, which sadly is what they want.
[01:12:59.159 --> 01:13:05.479]  I question everything now, Chase, and, you know, We like to say these people are idiots on the other side, these deep staters.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:08.680]  They're smart people, and they do long-term planning.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:15.100]  If you watch any of the Klaus Schwab World Economic Order stuff and the Davo stuff, they're planning long-term.
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:22.159]  Was that stuff a couple years ago just setting up this march to them controlling us and we becoming servs?
[01:13:22.890 --> 01:13:23.609]  It's possible.
[01:13:23.949 --> 01:13:30.550]  I mean, if you ever take the time, I mean, you can obviously watch the Klaus Schwab speech itself, which always gets all the news coverage.
[01:13:30.689 --> 01:13:37.670]  But if you really want to freak out, read the transcripts of the breakout sessions they have at their meetings that are not televised.
[01:13:37.949 --> 01:13:39.470]  That's where the scary stuff is at.
[01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:46.550]  And like Alex has said in the past, I believe you've said in the past, they're about 20 years behind, maybe 15. And it's interesting.
[01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:49.949]  You see what's going on today and you go back 15 years and you read those breakout transcripts.
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.140]  And it's, Alex is right.
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:54.500]  Once again, I gotta put another dollar in the Alex is right jar.
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:56.979]  Yeah, and it's like they intentionally make it so boring that nobody wants to pay attention.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:58.640]  Right, right.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:01.100]  And then they get behind closed doors and then they really get scary.
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:01.699]  Yeah.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:06.600]  And it takes a few people like, you know, like Alex to get in there and figure it out.
[01:14:06.699 --> 01:14:17.319]  But then, you know, he gets smeared and then like I have friends who when they hear that I'm going on the Alex Jones show or that I know Chase Geiser from the Alex Jones show, they look at me like I am crazy and evil.
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:18.079]  Oh, is that a drone?
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:18.380]  Yeah.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.239]  Are we showing a video of a drone now?
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:22.500]  Oh yeah, we've got a bunch of B-roll up with the drones as you're talking.
[01:14:22.619 --> 01:14:23.000]  It's just crazy.
[01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:23.619]  Oh, nice, nice.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:24.659]  Who knows what's real though?
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.239]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:14:26.439 --> 01:14:27.260]  I have a drone here.
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.520]  So I do fly a drone.
[01:14:28.779 --> 01:14:29.739]  Can I get it to come in?
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.319]  So I do fly a drone.
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.239]  So what's interesting about these drones is they do have...
[01:14:35.539 --> 01:14:36.260]  Sorry about that.
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:37.659]  They do have lights on them.
[01:14:37.859 --> 01:14:41.520]  And then you get them up in the air, and most of it's night, right?
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:46.079]  So then people grab their camera phones, and they point it at it, and the camera goes, oh, geez, it's dark.
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:48.140]  So they start slowing down the shutter speed.
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:51.880]  They start opening the aperture, start doing some software stuff to amplify the light.
[01:14:51.979 --> 01:14:54.859]  And then you get all these crazy streaks, and they look bigger than they really are.
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:58.319]  Like this one right here, out of focus, stuff going in circles.
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:01.880]  You know, is that just moisture getting caught up in the rotor wash?
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.399]  Is that, you know, so the camera starts just making art because it's digital.
[01:15:05.579 --> 01:15:09.819]  It starts making artifacts because it has to present something and it doesn't know what it is.
[01:15:09.899 --> 01:15:11.880]  And this happens in the paranormal world all the time.
[01:15:11.979 --> 01:15:13.140]  The camera sees something.
[01:15:13.279 --> 01:15:14.279]  It's really low light.
[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:17.479]  So just I got to put I got to color this pixel something.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.560]  So it just starts making artifacts.
[01:15:19.819 --> 01:15:20.979]  And then people get excited.
[01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:23.500]  They say, hey, we have an alien drone doing something crazy.
[01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:35.310]  Or like that other drone, did you see the footage of the drone that they said the one drone came in and then attacked the other drone and that drone went screaming down to the ground and crashed and all that stuff?
[01:15:35.489 --> 01:15:38.289]  I hadn't seen that video, but I did see a crash site of a drone or two.
[01:15:38.789 --> 01:15:45.449]  Okay, well there's actual video of two drones coming in and kind of doing the dance and the one just swoops in and hits it and then the other one goes down.
[01:15:45.689 --> 01:15:51.130]  Bottom line, you take out one propeller and the drone's useless and the one that got hit goes down.
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.300]  You know, they have landing feet under them.
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:56.319]  So the one drone came in on top, probably hit the propeller and dropped it.
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:59.460]  But those look like consumer drones.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:02.420]  They look like this DGI I just held up from China.
[01:16:02.619 --> 01:16:05.039]  You know, that records all of our information and sends it back to China.
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:05.899]  But, you know...
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:10.720]  But then people see it, they video it, and they go, hey, look at me.
[01:16:10.939 --> 01:16:11.539]  Here's the footage.
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.479]  We got some crazy drone stuff going on.
[01:16:13.619 --> 01:16:14.439]  Is this the government?
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:15.239]  I don't know, man.
[01:16:15.399 --> 01:16:21.420]  I just know that everything we're seeing now is fake, and I think our government is psyoping us because they want something.
[01:16:21.779 --> 01:16:22.739]  They want – and then what do we have?
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.039]  We have Kathy Hochul.
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:27.460]  We have – who's the governor of New Jersey?
[01:16:27.619 --> 01:16:28.460]  I'm forgetting now.
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:29.340]  I forget too.
[01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:33.270]  Yeah, they're – Yeah, they're screaming for our federal government.
[01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:34.329]  We want more law.
[01:16:34.449 --> 01:16:35.170]  We want more regulation.
[01:16:35.409 --> 01:16:35.409]  Right.
[01:16:35.529 --> 01:16:37.770]  Mayorkas even is saying that they want more drone regulation.
[01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.649]  Right.
[01:16:38.850 --> 01:16:39.670]  What are they after?
[01:16:39.689 --> 01:16:40.729]  What's going to be in that bill?
[01:16:40.810 --> 01:16:41.529]  I don't believe them.
[01:16:41.609 --> 01:16:42.369]  I don't trust them.
[01:16:42.609 --> 01:16:49.510]  I mean, I asked Gork, because I used Gork, not Chad GTP, to just list out some of the tragedies and then the laws and regulations that came after.
[01:16:49.569 --> 01:16:51.670]  And of course, the number one is 9-11 and then Patriot Act.
[01:16:57.450 --> 01:16:58.850]  Right.
[01:17:08.610 --> 01:17:09.010]  Exactly.
[01:17:09.289 --> 01:17:13.069]  But then there was like, I mean, it goes all the way back, like the Oklahoma City bombing with Timothy McVeigh.
[01:17:13.289 --> 01:17:17.229]  Could you imagine what we would know about that whole thing if we had today's technology back then?
[01:17:17.229 --> 01:17:18.770]  I really wonder what that was all about.
[01:17:18.949 --> 01:17:34.170]  But there was a lot of regulation and rules and stuff that was given to our government, our law enforcement and government that took away our civil liberties and gave them more power to investigate terrorists on the homeland, which they promptly used against citizens of America.
[01:17:34.369 --> 01:17:36.430]  And Edward Stone revealed it and had to escape his own country.
[01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:37.430]  Exactly.
[01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:39.289]  So what are they doing now?
[01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:41.390]  I mean, it started off as something, and this is what I think.
[01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:43.390]  I don't think when—I got another thing.
[01:17:43.489 --> 01:17:47.890]  So Sean Farage on Twitter, he posted this thing.
[01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:59.470]  It's from ABC7, and basically it is—from 23, there is an agreement in New Jersey with the government to open up a corridor for testing drones.
[01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:24.220]  And—I'm sorry, it's ABC8. I don't trust our government.
[01:18:24.279 --> 01:18:24.979]  I don't trust them.
[01:18:25.079 --> 01:18:27.539]  But they saw an opportunity to freak us out.
[01:18:27.989 --> 01:18:29.069]  And they're doing that now.
[01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:30.170]  And they really start playing up.
[01:18:30.430 --> 01:18:32.930]  Oh, it's nothing to worry about, but we don't know what it is.
[01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:34.430]  It's not Iran, but we don't know what it is.
[01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:36.949]  And then they're doing all this weird cagey stuff.
[01:18:37.069 --> 01:18:39.409]  And then you got the citizens coming in, sending their drones up.
[01:18:39.489 --> 01:18:42.010]  And then you get some local sheriff sending their drones up.
[01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:44.270]  And some people aren't even able to get their drones off the ground.
[01:18:44.329 --> 01:18:45.090]  Have you seen those reports?
[01:18:45.729 --> 01:18:46.409]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:47.770]  Which is not hard to do.
[01:18:47.970 --> 01:18:50.949]  I mean, just a simple jamming signal can happen.
[01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.890]  Yes, of course.
[01:18:52.069 --> 01:18:52.569]  I know my drone.
[01:18:52.689 --> 01:18:56.569]  So my drone, I was going to send it up in the air with the lights on and take some video of it last night.
[01:18:58.250 --> 01:19:09.470]  But because I'm within 30 miles of Disneyland, I can't fly my drone without reaching out to the drone maker and getting permission to have them zap in and adjust my geofencing.
[01:19:09.609 --> 01:19:11.310]  I can't fly my drone where I live.
[01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:13.489]  I have to go about another five miles away.
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:31.920]  Gee, I wonder what's going to be hidden in the fine print of that bill they're going to force through in the dark, you know, give the congressman, what, two hours to read it, and it's going to be 9,000 pages, and all of a sudden you and I aren't going to be able to leave our house and our electric cars because, you know, the 15-minute city thing.
[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:32.520]  Right.
[01:19:32.699 --> 01:19:34.399]  And they're going to have all the regulation for it.
[01:19:34.439 --> 01:19:39.119]  Well, you said something really, I think, powerful and important just in passing at the beginning of this segment.
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:42.560]  When I introduced you as an expert, you said, hey, I don't like being called an expert.
[01:19:42.859 --> 01:19:50.560]  And I'm with you on that because it's the appeal to authority fallacy where just because somebody has credentials doesn't mean that they're right about any given issue within their field.
[01:19:50.739 --> 01:19:52.720]  But I wanna show you clip number 31 and see what you think.
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:59.119]  This is RFK Jr. speaking the other day on trusting the experts is not very scientific.
[01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:05.210]  Let's watch clip 31. This phrase, trust the experts, It's not a thing.
[01:20:06.729 --> 01:20:10.109]  It certainly is not a feature of democracy.
[01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:12.850]  It's not a feature of science.
[01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:15.369]  In science, you don't trust the experts.
[01:20:15.630 --> 01:20:16.069]  Never.
[01:20:17.409 --> 01:20:21.210]  I've had over 500 cases.
[01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:26.270]  And in each one of them, there was scientific controversy and there was experts on both sides.
[01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:33.770]  When I sued Monsanto, Monsanto came in with experts from Stanford, Harvard, and Yale.
[01:20:35.289 --> 01:20:41.609]  My wife, who's an actor, came to court that day on the last day in their testimony.
[01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:52.750]  She watched these people and then afterwards, and they were so convincing, she walked out and she said, why are you even troubling this poor company to me?
[01:20:53.569 --> 01:20:55.649]  I was like, wait till tomorrow.
[01:20:56.189 --> 01:21:00.270]  The next day, we had our experts from Harvard, Stanford and Yale.
[01:21:01.399 --> 01:21:03.520]  And the jury gave us $2.2 billion.
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:08.119]  They had heard both of them, and they had to decide which expert is lying.
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:14.479]  And experts have their own prejudices, their own biases, and their own ambitions, etc.
[01:21:14.939 --> 01:21:19.460]  And so trusting the experts is not a feature of science.
[01:21:19.479 --> 01:21:21.380]  It's not a feature of democracy.
[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:24.979]  It's a feature of religion and totalitarianism.
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:26.840]  But it's not something we do.
[01:21:26.979 --> 01:21:27.859]  What do you think about that, Britt?
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:33.039]  You know, I did not know much about RFK until he came into the Trump orbit.
[01:21:33.039 --> 01:21:36.260]  And I said, hmm, I need to go down the rabbit hole on him.
[01:21:36.319 --> 01:21:37.199]  I just knew he was a Kennedy.
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:41.439]  I just assumed he was a leftist, you know, crazy Kennedy.
[01:21:42.979 --> 01:21:44.359]  And my God, I like this guy.
[01:21:44.539 --> 01:21:45.039]  Now, don't get me wrong.
[01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:48.420]  There are some things he really scares me on and I'm not on board with.
[01:21:48.539 --> 01:22:02.680]  But this whole – our health and the poisons in the food and the scientific research that goes on – I am on board with this guy 100% and I really hope that Trump just takes the leash off of him and says, go get him.
[01:22:02.899 --> 01:22:07.770]  Do what you gotta do to clean up this mess because Dude, he is so right.
[01:22:07.930 --> 01:22:09.170]  You get one expert that says one thing.
[01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:10.590]  Another expert says the exact opposite.
[01:22:10.829 --> 01:22:11.909]  And then how do you deal with that?
[01:22:12.069 --> 01:22:13.390]  You got to go to the white paper.
[01:22:13.489 --> 01:22:24.510]  And then now we know with the whistleblowers that have come out about these grants that are given to the scientists to research whatever, that if they research the wrong thing, they're not going to get the next round of grants.
[01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:29.409]  If they come up with the wrong conclusion, they're not going to get the next round of grants, which are all mostly government controlled.
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:38.960]  So are they shaping their outcomes and what they're doing to fit the narrative of what the government and the globalists want us, the serfs, to believe?
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:41.579]  I really think he's on to something.
[01:22:41.859 --> 01:22:51.859]  And sadly, the distrust in all of our systems, which the Marxists want, the distrust in all of our system is warranted and scary.
[01:22:51.859 --> 01:22:54.079]  And I don't know how we pull out of this.
[01:22:54.609 --> 01:23:01.550]  I really think that Trump and this little team of Avengers that he's assembled is our last chance to really straighten things out.
[01:23:01.689 --> 01:23:04.710]  But then after that, they're just going to be lying to us and we might as well be China.
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:16.640]  Yes, well you mentioned something too pertaining to the UFOs, or the drones rather, about New Jersey and legislation and policy that's allowing a certain corridor to be opened up to test drones in the area.
[01:23:16.899 --> 01:23:22.979]  And I found this clip that Joe Rogan actually shared the other day of Joey Diaz years ago talking about the number one.
[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:25.399]  Let's run this clip and unpack it on the other side and then we'll go to break.
[01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:34.079]  People don't know is that Hudson County, New Jersey, Northern New Jersey is the number one place in the country where they have the most UFO sightings.
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:35.199]  Really?
[01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:37.079]  Northern New Jersey?
[01:23:37.279 --> 01:23:39.899]  Look it up, Jamie, if you'll get a minute, please, not to be rude.
[01:23:40.119 --> 01:23:41.619]  But isn't that like near a couple airports?
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:42.359]  No.
[01:23:42.739 --> 01:23:47.340]  It's closer to, like, you know, like when you live in New York City and you look at the Hudson River?
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:52.479]  They say that people go on their balcony, they're drinking coffee, they talk on the phone, and they'll see a little flying saucer go by.
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:52.920]  Really?
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.739]  And I know for a fact that in 1976...
[01:23:56.739 --> 01:23:57.180]  Little one?
[01:23:57.779 --> 01:24:04.180]  Whatever the fuck they are, I know for a fact that in 1975 and 1976, you could check me out on this...
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:06.760]  A UFO landed in Hudson County Park.
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:09.479]  I was a kid and the next day the feds locked off the park.
[01:24:09.819 --> 01:24:11.079]  They had yellow tape.
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:11.960]  They had samples.
[01:24:12.399 --> 01:24:13.560]  Go look it up, dog.
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:16.260]  There's a UFO. You see that?
[01:24:17.439 --> 01:24:18.539]  That's called...
[01:24:18.539 --> 01:24:20.079]  North Bergen is where I'm from.
[01:24:20.619 --> 01:24:21.359]  That's called...
[01:24:21.359 --> 01:24:24.399]  I forget what it's called, but it's a circular building.
[01:24:25.050 --> 01:24:28.289]  So they did so much coke in there in the 80s, they called it the grinder.
[01:24:28.829 --> 01:24:31.310]  That's what they called it because it was shaped like the Stonehenge.
[01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:32.449]  The Stonehenge.
[01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:34.170]  I have a couple friends that lived there.
[01:24:35.069 --> 01:24:38.550]  People that lived in that building have seen UFOs for fucking years.
[01:24:38.770 --> 01:24:39.789]  So there you have it.
[01:24:39.829 --> 01:24:40.649]  I mean, what do you think of that?
[01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:43.550]  It implies to me that this is all- Number one, I love Joey.
[01:24:43.770 --> 01:24:43.970]  I know.
[01:24:44.029 --> 01:24:46.149]  Those stories that he tells are the best.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:47.659]  Oh, my God.
[01:24:47.819 --> 01:24:49.140]  But he's right.
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.739]  But then again, you've got to step back.
[01:24:51.819 --> 01:24:52.739]  And what's in the area?
[01:24:53.199 --> 01:24:56.720]  Military bases, trying to get out to the Atlantic to go out and test stuff.
[01:24:57.060 --> 01:25:01.079]  I mean, they obviously had this corridor that they officially designated.
[01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:03.180]  But how long have they been using that corridor?
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:10.239]  Again, when I was younger, probably 15 years ago, I was actually a hard rock gold.
[01:25:10.359 --> 01:25:13.279]  I did hard rock gold mining out in Death Valley.
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:14.520]  And I did it for two seasons.
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:20.930]  I spent eight months Yeah.
[01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:32.909]  Yeah.
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:40.840]  But it was fun to watch.
[01:25:40.939 --> 01:25:48.720]  But let me tell you, for the people that don't pay attention, the normies, as we like to call them, that are just living their life, they don't pay attention.
[01:25:48.819 --> 01:25:49.560]  They don't look up.
[01:25:49.659 --> 01:25:51.239]  They don't do any of that.
[01:25:52.119 --> 01:25:53.159]  So they don't know.
[01:25:53.279 --> 01:25:57.340]  And then all of a sudden, like what just happened here with the drones, it got on their radar.
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:58.460]  So now everybody's looking up.
[01:25:58.859 --> 01:26:00.479]  Everybody's now seeing everything.
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:06.479]  And the reality is 99.9% of it is just normal human vehicles in the sky.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:07.579]  I'm not going to...
[01:26:08.130 --> 01:26:08.829]  Stay with us, man.
[01:26:08.890 --> 01:26:10.210]  We're coming to break in 12 seconds.

[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:12.180]  And theologshownstore.com has brought back a fan favorite.
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:14.340]  We haven't had this shirt for five, six, seven years.
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:17.920]  It's the classic Infowars because there's a war on for your mind.

[01:27:41.119 --> 01:27:42.659]  This is going to be a bestseller as well.
[01:27:42.779 --> 01:27:44.899]  If you're blown away by these designs, this is just a few of them.

[01:27:55.710 --> 01:27:57.130]  Merry Christmas!
[01:28:19.949 --> 01:28:27.770]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geyser, joined by Britt T. Griffith, former host of Ghost Hunters, an expert in all things paranormal.
[01:28:28.859 --> 01:28:32.020]  Brett, I've got a couple of clips I want to show you and unpack with you.
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:35.439]  Let's start off, because I've heard rumors that maybe there's a dirty bomb.
[01:28:35.539 --> 01:28:53.420]  There was a report that was shared the other day that perhaps one of the Soviet-era nukes that was in Ukraine is in the United States, and these drones could be possibly being used to detect them, which would explain why the government is being so cryptic about what they are and why they're operating, because they wouldn't want to stir a panic and have everybody evacuate the entire region.
[01:28:53.539 --> 01:28:55.199]  Let's watch clip number 11 here.
[01:28:55.199 --> 01:28:56.920]  It's just two minutes long, Brett, and we'll unpack it together.
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:29:02.579]  Well, Putin said that he will use nuclear weapons if Russia is threatened.
[01:29:02.979 --> 01:29:06.140]  So is there actually a way of winning any war against Russia?
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:08.979]  Well, if he has nuclear, no one's winning, are they?
[01:29:10.119 --> 01:29:10.859]  Do you think he would?
[01:29:11.659 --> 01:29:12.760]  Yes, I think he would.
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:23.420]  I've got defence analysts feeding me information, and they're in, you know, services, and they're saying that there is going to be a nuclear detonation in Europe.
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:26.380]  Who buy?
[01:29:26.779 --> 01:29:28.859]  Well, it could be a dirty bomb.
[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:34.239]  I mean, there's a lot of nuclear material floating around in Ukraine from their nuclear reactors.
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:41.000]  I mean, to create contamination, all you need is some conventional explosives and some nuclear material, and you've got a dirty bomb.
[01:29:41.159 --> 01:29:43.800]  They may have already been set off in the Donbas area now.
[01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:46.380]  And that could be the false flag that starts the war?
[01:29:46.479 --> 01:29:46.579]  Yeah.
[01:29:47.239 --> 01:29:49.300]  There's many ways it can be done.
[01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:53.079]  Like 9-11.
[01:29:54.079 --> 01:29:55.079]  Like 9-11.
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:30:04.659]  And the other reasons we're having general elections is that Rishi's maintained that he's got inflation down to 2.3% and his plan's working.
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:08.560]  Well, if it was really working, he'd be waiting for the autumn to demonstrate it's working more.
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:14.720]  The fact is, he knows that food price inflation is going to rocket by the end of the summer.
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:20.859]  And that's going to be no relief on interest rates whatsoever.
[01:30:22.339 --> 01:30:25.520]  So this is as good as it gets for him on the economy.
[01:30:25.739 --> 01:30:31.680]  He's got to have an election by January next year, so there's no respite from the high interest rates.
[01:30:32.079 --> 01:30:37.960]  And the other thing is, of course, the disastrous and ineffective Rwanda.
[01:30:38.630 --> 01:30:43.529]  Bill, for dealing with the illegal migrants, that was only ever for show.
[01:30:43.829 --> 01:30:53.430]  Anyone who'd been in Parliament for more than five minutes looking at the legislature, it wasn't robust enough, not leaving the European Convention of Human Rights or the Treaty Convention on Refugees.
[01:30:53.829 --> 01:30:57.569]  All it was going to be is a blank cheque for lawyers to make a lot of money.
[01:30:57.770 --> 01:31:01.909]  There's more chance of you and I going to Rwanda than any illegal migrants, I can promise you.
[01:31:02.630 --> 01:31:08.350]  And of course, if you wait until November, that's going to be very apparent that no one's going to Rwanda.
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:19.000]  So, Brett, personally, I'm not very concerned about Russia using a dirty bomb in the United States, but I am concerned about the US government setting off a dirty bomb in the United States and blaming Russia.
[01:31:19.619 --> 01:31:21.359]  Do you think there's any merit to this angle?
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:23.300]  I have a few thoughts on that.
[01:31:24.119 --> 01:31:30.090]  Number one, they're pointing – If Putin's about to lose everything, of course he's gonna launch everything.
[01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:35.949]  But I'm sorry, but if Germany was about to lose everything or the EU and Poland, they would launch everything.
[01:31:35.989 --> 01:31:40.310]  If we here in the United States, we're about to lose everything, we would launch everything.
[01:31:41.069 --> 01:31:44.210]  And then the other thing you gotta look at and go back over history.
[01:31:45.479 --> 01:31:47.579]  The world powers are not good people.
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:50.380]  I mean, even us, we are not the good guys.
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:57.979]  You look at what Newland did or Blinken's doing or Hillary Clinton did or Rumsfeld did or Paul and Powell did.
[01:31:58.119 --> 01:32:00.399]  You can go back all the way to Kissinger for that matter.
[01:32:01.329 --> 01:32:09.130]  What our State Department has done around the world – and the only reason I know this is because when I was on Ghost Hunters International, I made a lot of friends with people in different countries.
[01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:10.930]  And they all told – we're not the good guys.
[01:32:10.989 --> 01:32:15.590]  Our State Department uses our name and our money to do really bad things.
[01:32:15.890 --> 01:32:18.390]  So let's just take that part of Putin.
[01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:20.470]  If he's going to lose everything, he's going to launch nukes.
[01:32:20.529 --> 01:32:21.369]  So he's really bad.
[01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:23.529]  We're going to do the same thing if we're about to lose everything.
[01:32:23.609 --> 01:32:24.970]  That's why we have them.
[01:32:25.789 --> 01:32:27.770]  As to the dirty bomb – so this is interesting.
[01:32:27.909 --> 01:32:28.609]  So I pulled this up.
[01:32:28.670 --> 01:32:31.340]  This is from – Nationalinterest.org.
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:41.920]  But in 1997, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, NIT, published a report that quoted that a former national security advisor from Russia, blah, blah, blah.
[01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:43.319]  There's about 100...
[01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:46.590]  Suitcase nukes that Russia lost track of.
[01:32:46.930 --> 01:32:47.109]  Yes.
[01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:48.869]  From 97, 2000, right in there.
[01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:49.789]  That are just gone.
[01:32:49.949 --> 01:32:54.050]  We have reports that, what is there, 80 nukes from Ukraine that they can't find?
[01:32:54.289 --> 01:32:54.689]  Warheads?
[01:32:54.930 --> 01:32:58.310]  Or they think they know where most are, but there's the one that they can't find.
[01:32:58.449 --> 01:33:00.210]  But who knows what they really know.
[01:33:02.170 --> 01:33:03.470]  Is it plausible, Chase?
[01:33:03.609 --> 01:33:04.930]  Yeah, anything's plausible.
[01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:07.949]  Do you think the drones are connected to the dirty bomb story at all?
[01:33:07.970 --> 01:33:10.109]  Do you think there's surveillance, or do you think there's something else going on?
[01:33:10.989 --> 01:33:15.300]  I... So when this first started, I was like, oh, aliens in the very beginning.
[01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:26.699]  And then I went to just government PSYOP testing stuff to now I think it's morphed into a – then I morphed into, man, what are they looking for?
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:27.979]  Chemical signature, nuclear bomb.
[01:33:28.119 --> 01:33:35.960]  I've gone through all this in my head and read all that I can on it and watched all that I can on it from these so-called experts.
[01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:45.289]  Where I'm at personally today – I think?
[01:34:01.159 --> 01:34:01.479]  Possibly.
[01:34:01.619 --> 01:34:03.020]  Look how open our border is.
[01:34:03.159 --> 01:34:04.600]  All the fentanyl that comes across.
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:06.659]  I mean, how hard is it to load a trunk with a suitcase?
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:09.359]  Yeah, I mean, over 20 million people came into the country illegally in the last three years.
[01:34:09.539 --> 01:34:10.220]  Yep, we don't know.
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:14.920]  And we know that I was watching the Sean Ryan show the other day, and he had that CIA analyst on.
[01:34:14.979 --> 01:34:15.939]  I forget her name for the live one.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:16.680]  She's really brilliant.
[01:34:16.779 --> 01:34:17.140]  Yeah, a thousand.
[01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:17.420]  Okay.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.319]  Yeah, there's a thousand that they know of in the United States.
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:22.640]  A thousand trained in the United States.
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:24.460]  So, yeah, we're in bad times.
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:33.279]  Well, it seems to me like, obviously, with the TikTok stuff going on, there's been a lot of antagonism toward Chinese data harvesting of U.S. citizens.
[01:34:33.899 --> 01:34:43.880]  And it's possible, since so many of these drones are made in China, that this is being used as an excuse to draft legislation to make it so your DJI doesn't work anywhere because of the Chinese data harvesting.
[01:34:44.539 --> 01:34:44.939]  Absolutely.
[01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:46.279]  That's absolutely possible.
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:48.789]  But That would make sense.
[01:34:48.989 --> 01:34:52.670]  I would look at that as a rational human being and go, that makes sense.
[01:34:52.829 --> 01:34:52.970]  Right.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:14.960]  What are they going to pack in there?
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:15.920]  That's what worries me.
[01:35:16.039 --> 01:35:18.300]  They're not going to give our politicians time to read it.
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:19.659]  They're not going to have time to read it.
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:21.180]  They're going to slam it through.
[01:35:21.319 --> 01:35:30.439]  And then it's going to be people like Alex Jones and you and your staff and others like the Bonginos and the Pools and the da-da-da that are going to start parsing through it after it's law.
[01:35:30.699 --> 01:35:32.460]  And then we're going to go, whoa, whoa.
[01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:39.899]  We as Americans are really horrible at understanding the law of unintended consequences that come.
[01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:43.829]  We also are so insulated by having two oceans on each side.
[01:35:43.949 --> 01:35:45.829]  We have Canada to the north that ain't going to fight nothing.
[01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:48.149]  And Mexico is so disorganized and corrupt, they can't.
[01:35:48.210 --> 01:35:49.130]  We are protected.
[01:35:49.130 --> 01:35:49.750]  We are spoiled.
[01:35:49.869 --> 01:35:51.069]  We have no idea what war means.
[01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:53.930]  We have no idea what suicide bomb.
[01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:57.970]  There has not been a single suicide bomber inside the United States.
[01:35:58.010 --> 01:35:58.510]  Did you know that?
[01:35:58.569 --> 01:35:59.409]  I just learned that the other day.
[01:35:59.529 --> 01:35:59.930]  Not one.
[01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:01.390]  Wow, I never thought of that.
[01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:11.420]  We don't know the horror of That the European country, the citizens over there go through, or the Middle East for that matter, we do not understand that horror.
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:15.319]  We do not understand the horror that the Jewish people deal with every day in Israel.
[01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:17.039]  We do not understand that horror.
[01:36:17.159 --> 01:36:17.680]  We don't.
[01:36:17.779 --> 01:36:18.899]  Because we're insulated.
[01:36:19.039 --> 01:36:21.899]  We're the biggest, baddest country on the block.
[01:36:23.029 --> 01:36:29.149]  And we're blessed with weak neighbors north and south and two big oceans that we can sit in our heated room.
[01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:30.810]  And for so long, our government didn't matter.
[01:36:31.050 --> 01:36:35.470]  It was so small and contained that it didn't matter what legislation they passed because it wouldn't have a direct impact.
[01:36:35.609 --> 01:36:41.069]  But now, since the federal government has become so overreaching, all this legislation really does matter.
[01:36:41.210 --> 01:36:45.430]  We're starting to feel the corruption at the lowest levels of our society in a really palpable way.
[01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:50.010]  I want to show you this clip 37. This is Tucker's take on the UABs.
[01:36:50.010 --> 01:36:52.590]  I'm not sure if you've seen this or not yet, but let's watch this and unpack it.
[01:36:52.670 --> 01:36:52.890]  Go ahead.
[01:36:53.109 --> 01:37:00.189]  One I've known, which is every president, who's been really read into this stuff, is unwilling to disclose what he learned.
[01:37:01.210 --> 01:37:03.729]  And you have to ask, like, why is that?
[01:37:03.869 --> 01:37:08.270]  So I think the truth is, and I haven't gotten to the truth, but I've gotten close enough that I'm like, oof.
[01:37:10.609 --> 01:37:13.970]  I think it's very, very disruptive, like way disruptive.
[01:37:14.189 --> 01:37:21.369]  It's not just that Lockheed is making a lot of money on anti-gravity technology or, you know, we've been visited by people from their planet or whatever.
[01:37:21.550 --> 01:37:22.569]  I mean, I think there's more there.
[01:37:22.750 --> 01:37:23.510]  I mean, there is more there.
[01:37:23.949 --> 01:37:25.670]  So and I'm not exactly sure.
[01:37:25.770 --> 01:37:26.489]  I'm not going to speculate.
[01:37:26.529 --> 01:37:28.090]  But I think it's a big deal.
[01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:32.710]  I think it's a bigger deal than we than we often allow for it being.
[01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.829]  Right.
[01:37:34.369 --> 01:37:37.010]  I mean, obviously, I mean, there's been going on for 80 years.
[01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:44.069]  So Yeah, I could literally, with this technology, not have to go to the airport, wait six hours, take my family with luggage.
[01:37:44.069 --> 01:37:47.710]  I could be at your house and have dinner with you right now.
[01:37:48.210 --> 01:37:53.069]  And to me, it's just a massive crime that we're allowing cancer.
[01:37:53.069 --> 01:37:54.210]  But can I ask you a question?
[01:37:55.409 --> 01:38:00.829]  There's this process of recovering of these craft, whatever they are, right?
[01:38:01.369 --> 01:38:04.390]  The so-called biologics that reside within, supposedly.
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:06.600]  And I'm sure you're aware of this.
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:09.840]  So how exactly are there so many crashed UAPs?
[01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:10.899]  What is that?
[01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:18.920]  They have the technology to, you know, travel 150 knots underwater, but they somehow crash a lot?
[01:38:19.119 --> 01:38:20.920]  I mean, it doesn't kind of make any sense.
[01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:22.699]  They just have, like, bad GPS or something?
[01:38:23.079 --> 01:38:27.279]  It's like they possess technology that defies the laws of physics, but they crash.
[01:38:27.739 --> 01:38:29.699]  So I just don't think that makes any sense.
[01:38:29.699 --> 01:38:32.600]  And what I believe is true is that...
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:38.960]  These recoveries have been the result of the summoning of these craft.
[01:38:39.279 --> 01:38:42.760]  And that's the word that was related to me, the summoning of these craft.
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:47.180]  So if you're summoning, what does that even mean?
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.640]  You're talking about a phenomenon that exists in the spiritual realm.
[01:38:51.819 --> 01:38:54.819]  I mean, that's more like a seance than a science expedition, right?
[01:38:55.239 --> 01:38:58.479]  It doesn't make it any less real, by the way, but it changes the category.
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:00.739]  What do you think about that, Brett?
[01:39:03.439 --> 01:39:05.119]  Again, absolutely plausible.
[01:39:05.359 --> 01:39:07.880]  In the realm of possibilities, I have entertained it.
[01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:09.720]  I have been around seances.
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:12.619]  I have witnessed seances where they were summoning stuff.
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:16.600]  Not that UFOs came, but weird stuff happened.
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:23.960]  Black, massy balls of stuff come in and go into the – so there's – it's possible.
[01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:29.130]  It's possible that what we're dealing with is from the spiritual realm or a different plane or whatever.
[01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:30.970]  I mean, it's absolutely possible.
[01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:40.460]  Well, and these drones could be cover for the actual interdimensional ones that do happen on a much less frequently – much less frequent – Absolutely.
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.560]  I mean, let's expand that out.
[01:39:42.659 --> 01:39:57.899]  So our government or the world leaders are summoning in stuff, but the consumer technology to observe what's going on has improved so much for us in the last 10, 15 years that they now have to throw up all this other smoke,
[01:39:57.899 --> 01:40:05.689]  which is all these other weird New Jersey drone sightings and Maybe they have operatives out just flying drones to confuse people just to cover up.
[01:40:05.789 --> 01:40:09.890]  Hey, we're going to summon whatever ship, whatever they're summoning, like Tucker's saying.
[01:40:10.029 --> 01:40:12.949]  And I'm just going down Tucker's rabbit hole here.
[01:40:13.239 --> 01:40:15.899]  Not that I necessarily believe in this or not, but it's interesting.
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:17.220]  It's an interesting thought experiment.
[01:40:17.399 --> 01:40:18.720]  But they're summoning it in.
[01:40:18.819 --> 01:40:20.859]  So okay, we're gonna bring this in.
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:23.000]  So right now, send everything up in the air.
[01:40:23.119 --> 01:40:24.399]  Confuse the hell out of everybody.
[01:40:24.779 --> 01:40:26.180]  Do cryptic messages.
[01:40:26.439 --> 01:40:29.479]  The government, oh, nothing to worry about, but we don't know what it is, but nothing to worry.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.600]  While they weave in whatever they're summoning.
[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:33.239]  Right.
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:35.359]  Well, and if you know anybody in tech...
[01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:40.829]  And in the government, they use terms like that to describe real technology.
[01:40:41.029 --> 01:40:45.130]  So, for example, the famous D-Day invasion was Operation Overlord.
[01:40:45.329 --> 01:40:48.829]  It didn't mean that there was actually an Overlord, but they used cool things like Overlord, right?
[01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:51.170]  Or they call something Skynet, which is a play on Terminator.
[01:40:51.369 --> 01:41:00.090]  And it makes sense to me that if you hack a drone and you force it to land or crash, that they might call that summoning the drone or summoning the target.
[01:41:00.170 --> 01:41:00.310]  Yeah.
[01:41:00.979 --> 01:41:02.500]  Well, I mean, it's in the manuals.
[01:41:02.659 --> 01:41:06.680]  When your drone gets too far out, you can summon it back.
[01:41:06.899 --> 01:41:07.060]  Yeah.
[01:41:07.539 --> 01:41:09.319]  You can just hit a button and it summons it back.
[01:41:09.319 --> 01:41:16.220]  And I don't disagree with Tucker that there are likely interdimensional entities that are co-located with the Earth that sometimes appear.
[01:41:16.479 --> 01:41:19.779]  But what we're seeing now in these reports are clearly drones.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:34.250]  We're not seeing the 90-degree angle turns, the flashing away, and then the reappearing 30 miles in We're good to go.
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:58.640]  And they were doing their whatever they were doing.
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:00.380]  I don't know anything about that world.
[01:42:00.479 --> 01:42:02.819]  I don't do seances, but they were doing their thing.
[01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:14.800]  And two of us at the same time saw this cat-sized ball at the kind of the corner of the upper ceiling wall, went scurrying across the wall, dropped down to the ground and shot into the room where they were doing the seance.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:18.600]  And the team member and I looked at each other and we went, did you just see that?
[01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:21.640]  And the team member said, like a small cat-sized black ball.
[01:42:21.739 --> 01:42:22.579]  I said, yeah.
[01:42:22.619 --> 01:42:23.020]  Yeah.
[01:42:23.119 --> 01:42:24.460]  So what was that all about?
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:27.319]  They were summoning something and something came.
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:34.180]  So have you arrived at a place personally based on all of your experiences where you believe that there is some spiritual realm?
[01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:37.800]  I think there is a greater being that's created us.
[01:42:37.939 --> 01:42:40.199]  I don't necessarily believe in organized religion per se.
[01:42:40.359 --> 01:42:43.359]  You gotta go to the, you gotta pray to the guy in the funny hat type of thing.
[01:42:45.239 --> 01:42:47.279]  There is something out there I cannot explain.
[01:42:47.479 --> 01:42:50.819]  But for me to be able to tell you what that is, I have no idea.
[01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:52.750]  There's just – it's energy.
[01:42:52.890 --> 01:42:58.289]  There's stuff out there, God, Allah, Buddha, whatever you want to call it.
[01:42:58.569 --> 01:43:02.430]  There's something that created us because we're too unique, too different.
[01:43:02.630 --> 01:43:02.770]  Yeah.
[01:43:03.390 --> 01:43:05.970]  Did you always believe that or has it been since your experience?
[01:43:06.510 --> 01:43:13.750]  No, I used to – well, I was – My mom went K-12 in the Catholic school, and the nuns beat religion right out of her.
[01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:18.170]  So not that I was raised in an anti-God house, but I was raised in a godless house.
[01:43:18.289 --> 01:43:19.310]  She didn't force it on us.
[01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:21.850]  So I kind of came up not really knowing anything about it.
[01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:22.569]  Then I was an atheist.
[01:43:22.670 --> 01:43:26.890]  I just thought, you die, you fade to black, we're done, we get one shot at this planet, enjoy it while you're here.
[01:43:27.050 --> 01:43:31.189]  And then I started to get into the paranormal, and then I went on hyperdrive when I got on Ghost Hunters.
[01:43:31.649 --> 01:43:34.970]  And I have seen so much stuff I have now tacked back to.
[01:43:36.449 --> 01:43:37.869]  There's something to it.
[01:43:38.130 --> 01:43:41.310]  There's something to this religious God-faith thing.
[01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:48.289]  I don't know exactly what it is, but I've just seen too much different stuff that there's a spirit inside of us.
[01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:54.829]  There's something, you know, the studies that they've done where when someone expires, what is it, the 26 ounces?
[01:43:55.289 --> 01:43:56.090]  26 ounces.
[01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.869]  Yeah, they lose weight.
[01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:58.109]  They lose weight.
[01:43:58.550 --> 01:44:07.350]  There's the experiments that they did in the hospitals back, I think it was North Carolina, where the out-of-body experiments, where they had the high shelves and they put paper up top with simple big words.
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:11.979]  And then patients would be on the table and they would die on the table and they would bring them back.
[01:44:12.159 --> 01:44:14.760]  And the people would say, I was above you looking down.
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:16.699]  I saw this paper with this writing on it.
[01:44:16.939 --> 01:44:18.100]  So there's something.
[01:44:18.439 --> 01:44:18.960]  They knew the words.
[01:44:19.159 --> 01:44:20.199]  They knew the words.
[01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:20.739]  Wow.
[01:44:21.180 --> 01:44:22.359]  You can look this up.
[01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:23.279]  This is legit stuff.
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:24.420]  Doctors did this.
[01:44:24.479 --> 01:44:25.220]  Surgeons did this.
[01:44:25.779 --> 01:44:26.500]  Psychologists did this.
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:28.539]  So there's something to it.
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:29.579]  That was my arc.
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:33.500]  And it was investigating the paranormal that really kind of opened my eyes to that.
[01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:34.939]  There's something to it.
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:35.640]  I don't know what.
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:36.739]  I really don't.
[01:44:36.739 --> 01:44:40.600]  I don't trust the human—I don't trust man in general.
[01:44:40.819 --> 01:44:45.359]  So Jesus did his thing 2,000 years ago, and then a few hundred years later they put it on paper.
[01:44:45.739 --> 01:44:53.359]  You know, that—or the King James edition of the Bible where King James had it rewritten to—so what was changed, what wasn't?
[01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:58.189]  Right, so you have doubts about the fact that Constantine— How true is it?
[01:44:58.689 --> 01:44:59.449]  I understand.
[01:45:00.409 --> 01:45:04.670]  Just because it's man writing it and man tends to shift things in their favor over time.
[01:45:04.850 --> 01:45:06.069]  But there's definitely something to it.
[01:45:06.149 --> 01:45:07.109]  That's just where I come from.
[01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:07.590]  Yeah.
[01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:10.489]  Well, it sounds like you, like everyone else, is in the middle of a journey.
[01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:15.449]  I want to know, though, from you, what is the craziest thing that you've experienced?
[01:45:15.449 --> 01:45:22.699]  What stands out as one of the top five My God, it is so hard to do that because I was on that show and we traveled everywhere.
[01:45:22.779 --> 01:45:25.220]  You can watch most of these on the show.
[01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:30.779]  We were at the Epstein Lighthouse and I'm sitting on the ground on these upper stairs and the claim was footsteps walk by.
[01:45:30.859 --> 01:45:31.300]  I'm sitting there.
[01:45:31.359 --> 01:45:32.399]  My hands are on the ground.
[01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:39.579]  Amy was sitting in another room on a bed and we start hearing footsteps and I felt the vibration of footsteps walk right by me.
[01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:41.000]  Like, I felt it.
[01:45:41.119 --> 01:45:41.699]  We heard it.
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:42.560]  She heard it.
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:43.500]  And I felt it.
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:44.500]  What was that all about?
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:45.439]  I don't know.
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:48.220]  We were, KJ and I were in a room.
[01:45:48.619 --> 01:45:50.659]  KJ was one of the partners on the show for a while.
[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:53.979]  And we were literally able to go, if you're here, open the door.
[01:45:54.079 --> 01:45:55.020]  And the door freaking opened.
[01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:57.659]  And then KJ goes, if you really want to impress us, close the door.
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:45:58.479]  And then the door closed.
[01:45:59.300 --> 01:45:59.619]  Wow.
[01:46:00.079 --> 01:46:04.180]  So if a door is going to, you know, unlatch and open one way, that's, you can debunk that.
[01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:05.640]  There's something, a truck going by, vibrate.
[01:46:05.779 --> 01:46:10.039]  But for it to open and close, to go against the ground, it's, Weird stuff like that.
[01:46:11.779 --> 01:46:14.819]  The frickin' ball thing with the seance thing was crazy.
[01:46:17.399 --> 01:46:20.939]  There's a place called the Urea Shrine, and it's in the south.
[01:46:21.159 --> 01:46:21.560]  I can't remember.
[01:46:21.619 --> 01:46:22.380]  I forget which state.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.520]  But they got a lot of black magic, a lot of voodoo magic, a lot of...
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:32.600]  They got a lot of stuff going on there, and we went there and investigated, and it went off the hook.
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:37.020]  There's just weird stuff going on there, weird energy, weird voice, like literally voices...
[01:46:38.579 --> 01:46:49.000]  Literally the spirit box thing, which is a radio frequency scanner, and then voices come through it, answering direct questions, saying my full name, saying my kid's name.
[01:46:49.439 --> 01:46:51.260]  So I've seen stuff I can't explain.
[01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:52.460]  I don't know what it is.
[01:46:52.739 --> 01:46:56.140]  Do you get the impression that it's like a dark energy or is it neutral?
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:57.500]  I think it's both.
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:46:58.619]  I think it's just like humans.
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:00.060]  There are good humans and there are bad humans.
[01:47:00.239 --> 01:47:01.779]  There are good energy and there's bad energy.
[01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:03.100]  The yin and the yang.
[01:47:03.770 --> 01:47:05.649]  You can't have darkness without light.
[01:47:06.189 --> 01:47:09.149]  Why do you think it is that these experiences are always kind of subtle?
[01:47:09.289 --> 01:47:12.630]  Why is it that it's not just clear as day, a ghost right in front of you talking to you?
[01:47:12.829 --> 01:47:15.329]  Why does it have to be a door opening or a weird radio frequency?
[01:47:17.149 --> 01:47:17.890]  Energy, maybe.
[01:47:18.090 --> 01:47:19.350]  Maybe it takes a lot of energy.
[01:47:19.770 --> 01:47:21.770]  I mean, I do know the whole cold spot thing.
[01:47:21.829 --> 01:47:24.069]  After paranormal activity happens, the room is cold.
[01:47:24.449 --> 01:47:26.949]  Well, heat is energy, so it zapped all the energy out of the air.
[01:47:27.949 --> 01:47:28.470]  Oh, yeah.
[01:47:29.409 --> 01:47:30.850]  Literally, I had a...
[01:47:33.630 --> 01:47:38.850]  Temperature reader with probes on it, and I was able to probe about a 10 degree difference of a ball of energy.
[01:47:39.029 --> 01:47:42.029]  It was like the ball was 10 degrees colder than everything around it.
[01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:43.430]  And then it kind of moved around the room.
[01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:44.289]  We were able to probe it.
[01:47:44.350 --> 01:47:45.050]  That's on camera.
[01:47:45.130 --> 01:47:58.390]  You can watch it on the Ghost Hunter series when it was on Syfy, not A&E. So I've done stuff that I cannot explain, and it's hard to tell people who just don't believe.
[01:47:58.649 --> 01:47:59.689]  They don't want to believe.
[01:47:59.829 --> 01:48:00.430]  They don't believe.
[01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:01.789]  They think it's all demon stuff.
[01:48:01.890 --> 01:48:02.630]  I don't think it's that.
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:06.359]  And I articulate it and they go, I don't believe you.
[01:48:06.479 --> 01:48:07.479]  There's nothing I can do about that.
[01:48:08.230 --> 01:48:10.449]  But I do try to use equipment to document it all.
[01:48:10.569 --> 01:48:11.289]  Sure, sure.
[01:48:11.409 --> 01:48:12.510]  It's fascinating to me.
[01:48:12.590 --> 01:48:17.090]  I don't dabble in it because I don't want to go down that road, but I'd love to hear about it from others who have dabbled.
[01:48:17.250 --> 01:48:18.630]  It's absolutely fascinating.
[01:48:18.850 --> 01:48:29.970]  And I do agree with Tucker, generally speaking, that we're likely contacted by co-located interdimensional beings, which are written about in ancient texts, whether it's the Bible or others, as angels or demons, right?
[01:48:30.050 --> 01:48:36.689]  That would be how someone from back then would maybe encapsulate or characterize whatever they're experiencing that they can't explain.
[01:48:39.540 --> 01:48:49.000]  But with this UFO thing, specifically the drone thing, very obvious that what we've seen over the last couple of weeks is our own government with its own technology being very weird.
[01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:49.960]  What are they hiding?
[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:53.380]  Oh man, they're hiding a lot.
[01:48:53.739 --> 01:48:58.460]  But obviously, I remember from the 80s, airquakes.
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:01.079]  We used to have airquakes in Southern California.
[01:49:01.729 --> 01:49:03.729]  It didn't register on the ground, but there were earthquakes.
[01:49:03.890 --> 01:49:14.670]  It turned out it was TRW, a defense contractor down in South Orange County, testing massive layers, blowing up 10 by 10 chunks of concrete because they were building Star Wars, the SDI initiative.
[01:49:15.239 --> 01:49:16.180]  I think?
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:41.640]  There was some weird drone stuff that happened probably because of this corridor.
[01:49:41.819 --> 01:49:42.479]  They're testing stuff.
[01:49:42.619 --> 01:49:43.699]  People started to freak out.
[01:49:43.819 --> 01:49:49.399]  And someone in the deep state, whatever you want to call that, the blog, figured out, hey, we can use this to grab more power.
[01:49:49.539 --> 01:49:50.899]  I mean, look at what they're doing to Trump.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.600]  They're selling off the border wall for pennies on the dollar.
[01:49:55.370 --> 01:49:56.770]  Right.
[01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:58.909]  Right.
[01:50:00.409 --> 01:50:00.930]  Right.
[01:50:15.939 --> 01:50:30.619]  Them testing stuff, people freaking out, then people sending up their own drones, and then people making fake stuff to screw with people, and our government going, hey, let's run up the fear factor, and then slam through some kind of patriot-type bill.
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:31.979]  That makes a lot of sense.
[01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:34.460]  Britt, it's been an honor and a pleasure to have you on The Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:35.420]  Thank you so much for joining me.
[01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:38.020]  Tell people where they can follow you, find you, and support you.
[01:50:38.479 --> 01:50:42.020]  Well, mostly I do all my politics on X, the only platform to be on.
[01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:46.399]  So it's Britt T. Griffith on X. And thanks for having me on, Chase.
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:47.060]  It was a blast.
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:47.659]  Absolutely.
[01:50:47.859 --> 01:50:48.819]  Come back anytime, Britt.
[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:50.239]  I'll call you later today.
[01:50:50.359 --> 01:50:50.920]  We'll debrief.
[01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:53.119]  All right, folks, we're coming up on a break here in two minutes.
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:55.279]  I am going to open up the phone lines.
[01:50:55.460 --> 01:51:02.859]  I want to talk specifically about this drone stuff, the UFO stuff, these phenomena, anything that Britt and I talked about as well as fair game.
[01:51:02.979 --> 01:51:06.699]  Please call in 877-789-2539.
[01:51:07.359 --> 01:51:10.840]  Again, that's 877-789-2539.
[01:51:11.630 --> 01:51:12.590]  One more time, finally.
[01:51:12.770 --> 01:51:14.930]  It's 877-789-2539.
[01:51:15.130 --> 01:51:17.869]  We'll be taking calls for the third hour of the show today.
[01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:22.449]  And in the fourth hour, we will have the great Gerald Salente hosting as well.
[01:51:22.949 --> 01:51:26.970]  Before we go to break, in this last 90 seconds, I do want to talk to you and remind you a little bit about Optimal Human.
[01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:28.310]  Optimal Human is back in stock.
[01:51:28.489 --> 01:51:29.329]  One of the best sellers.
[01:51:29.489 --> 01:51:31.270]  I think it's the best seller right now on the store.
[01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:35.760]  Since it's been back in stock last week, it's an amazing product, guys.
[01:51:36.159 --> 01:51:40.579]  I mean, even if it wasn't being sold on the AlexJonesStore.com, I would still be getting this.
[01:51:40.659 --> 01:51:42.239]  It's not a charity case to get this.
[01:51:42.239 --> 01:51:43.020]  It's so good for you.
[01:51:43.119 --> 01:51:50.899]  It's got vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, biotin, calcium, iron.
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:51.979]  I mean, it's just loaded.
[01:51:52.159 --> 01:51:53.779]  It's the best super green on the market.
[01:51:54.039 --> 01:51:56.140]  Great price at the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:51:56.260 --> 01:51:56.739]  Back in stock.
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:51:59.090]  Helps with things like Gut health and digestive health.
[01:51:59.229 --> 01:52:02.529]  Even if you don't have gut problems or you don't think you have gut problems, I guarantee you do.
[01:52:02.729 --> 01:52:09.350]  So please do something about it, whether it's getting optimal human or ultimate probiotic or ultimate gut cleanse from the Alex Jones store.
[01:52:09.489 --> 01:52:14.750]  This helps with brain and cognitive function, body balancing with adaptogens, nutrient-rich superfood.
[01:52:15.029 --> 01:52:18.609]  I think?
[01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:32.619]  Just because it's got all the nutrients your body's been starving for.
[01:52:32.779 --> 01:52:36.560]  So please, go to thealexjonesstore.com and get Optimal Human right now.
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:44.920]  Don't just get it because it's awesome for your mind and body, but get it because you're fighting for humanity, free speech, alternative media, Alex Jones, all at the same time at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:47.539]  Stay tuned for more breaking news and calls on the other side.
[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:51.380]  Christmas ornaments, drywall, and Jerry Epstein.
[01:52:52.119 --> 01:52:54.460]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:57.960]  There are three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:52:58.359 --> 01:53:01.560]  Drywall, Christmas tree lights, and Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:53:01.899 --> 01:53:04.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in free fall.
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:06.579]  Their entire criminal operation is collapsing.
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:13.060]  Trump is officially going after the Biden administration for the criminal human trafficking and sex slavery.
[01:53:13.479 --> 01:53:16.340]  We're going to take control January 20th, and people are going to be held accountable.
[01:53:16.659 --> 01:53:17.760]  We're going to be very transparent.
[01:53:17.979 --> 01:53:18.859]  We're going to get behind.
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:22.279]  What did the United Nations have to do with the open border crisis?
[01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:24.039]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[01:53:24.170 --> 01:53:28.310]  We're going to be very transparent American people, and we're going to tell them the truth of what happened on this border.
[01:53:28.470 --> 01:53:29.770]  Again, by design.
[01:53:29.949 --> 01:53:31.449]  And so much more is happening.
[01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:32.489]  This is an exciting time.
[01:53:32.729 --> 01:53:34.670]  But the globalists are striking back.
[01:53:34.810 --> 01:53:38.750]  That's why it's important to keep our operation on air now more than ever.
[01:53:38.869 --> 01:53:40.750]  And we can't do it without you.
[01:53:40.789 --> 01:53:41.710]  So we make it easy.
[01:53:41.850 --> 01:53:51.810]  Go to thealexshonestore.com and get the most amazing, widest selection of patriot apparel anywhere to spread the word, to meet like-minded people, and support the InfoWard.
[01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:52.250]  Now...
[01:53:52.789 --> 01:54:01.270]  The folks at Bigly that power the AlexJoStore.com have come out with some amazing limited edition Christmas hoodies and sweaters.
[01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:02.909]  And I personally love this one.
[01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:06.609]  I'm not usually into wearing a shirt with myself on it, but this one's really cool.
[01:54:06.810 --> 01:54:09.069]  And the family and friends will have so much fun.
[01:54:09.069 --> 01:54:10.390]  It's a great conversation piece.
[01:54:10.710 --> 01:54:12.170]  And this will horrify.
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:17.260]  Leftists, and then maybe you can be friendly to them once they are up against the wall, shaking and framing and walking on the street.
[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:17.939]  Say, it's okay.
[01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:23.039]  Alex Jones doesn't bite, though it kind of does look like I'm Jaws coming up on the swimmer there.
[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:29.680]  There's so many other great limited edition shirts, hoodies, sweaters right now.
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:33.119]  And then, of course, there's the Darth Sidious hoodies.
[01:54:33.739 --> 01:54:35.439]  Trump won, I'm afraid.
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:42.600]  While you're there, believe me, If you love our information, you're gonna love the supplements like Ultimate Sea Moss.
[01:54:42.699 --> 01:54:44.420]  That is the ultimate superfood.
[01:54:44.659 --> 01:54:46.859]  It's the strongest, one of the strongest out there.
[01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:48.979]  We get it from a top supplier.
[01:54:48.979 --> 01:54:49.800]  It's private label.
[01:54:49.819 --> 01:54:50.779]  It is super strong.
[01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:53.260]  Equivalent of 40 grams per serving.
[01:54:53.590 --> 01:54:58.630]  That's two capsules of sea moss with the very best organic iodine, the very best vitamin minerals.
[01:54:58.789 --> 01:55:02.369]  It's a superfood of superfoods for a reason.

[01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:35.270]  I am so addicted to it.
[01:55:35.729 --> 01:55:41.930]  I'd heard about CMOS being a superfood, our CMOS namely, but the folks immediately say, you're recommending all these supplements and that's great.
[01:55:42.489 --> 01:55:44.710]  Kind of got your vitaminal fusion with electrolytes.
[01:55:44.810 --> 01:55:50.789]  That's Hydroforce and a great gut cleanse and a great probiotic and energy gummies and sleep gummies.
[01:55:50.890 --> 01:55:53.170]  Those are all great, Mr. Jones, but those are great guys.
[01:55:53.250 --> 01:55:53.770]  They're so respectful.
[01:55:54.069 --> 01:55:57.670]  They're like, but have you looked at the CMOS? We've got one of the top suppliers that'll let us private label it.
[01:55:57.810 --> 01:56:01.949]  And I looked at it and I was like, oh my God, this is the superfood other than maybe hemp.
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:03.920]  But it does other effects than him.

[01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:29.420]  It's an exciting time to be alive.
[01:56:29.939 --> 01:56:32.180]  Pretty dangerous for me and Trump, but we wouldn't be anywhere else.
[01:56:32.380 --> 01:56:34.640]  Thanks for keeping me and President Trump with the fight.
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:35.920]  God bless and good luck.
[01:56:36.399 --> 01:56:37.560]  Oh, and I almost forgot.
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:40.439]  Merry, Merry Christmas to everybody.
[01:56:40.619 --> 01:56:43.500]  That's so triggering to the left, but I also love Christmas.
[01:56:43.859 --> 01:56:47.239]  And a Happy New Year with President Trump about to come into office.
[01:56:54.869 --> 01:56:58.649]  Pfizer was served its due at their main corporate headquarters.
[01:56:59.050 --> 01:57:02.729]  The Unjected podcast has taken the bull by the horns.
[01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:18.800]  They and others behind the cause known as Team Humanity have filed a landmark federal lawsuit in the United States District Court in Galveston, Texas, naming names including the Biden-Harris administration, The state of Hawaii,
[01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:34.579]  Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson& Johnson, the CDC, the NIH, FDA, EPA, NIAID, FEMA, the World Health Organization, the DOD, DOJ, FBI, DHS, US Air Force, Space Force,
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:38.039]  the FAA, and all commercial airlines.
[01:57:39.970 --> 01:57:49.470]  From their internal documents, delayed reporting the deaths of eight subjects, people who died with COVID who were vaccinated.
[01:57:50.130 --> 01:58:07.270]  And they delayed reporting it in spite of their own protocols that said they had to report deaths immediately so that they could Misinform the FDA in order to get the emergency use authorization that allowed the rollout of the vaccine that we all know about.
[01:58:07.770 --> 01:58:11.130]  Okay, well, this is us serving Pfizer Corporation.
[01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:12.569]  No, you can do this here.
[01:58:12.789 --> 01:58:12.949]  No, sir, you can.
[01:58:13.090 --> 01:58:13.529]  Security?
[01:58:13.909 --> 01:58:14.510]  I can leave.
[01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:15.350]  That's all we do.
[01:58:16.489 --> 01:58:17.250]  You've been served.
[01:58:17.409 --> 01:58:18.250]  Pfizer, you've been served.
[01:58:18.649 --> 01:58:21.550]  The lowest risk for getting COVID is if you've had zero vaccines.
[01:58:21.770 --> 01:58:24.750]  As you add vaccines, your risk to get COVID goes up.
[01:58:24.970 --> 01:58:26.970]  I've never seen a vaccine like this.
[01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:29.170]  That's not the basis of vaccines.
[01:58:29.310 --> 01:58:32.329]  They shouldn't have what we would call negative efficacy.
[01:58:32.569 --> 01:58:37.609]  That is a peer-reviewed, beautiful study from Cleveland Clinic, completely ignored.
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:38.800]  What's up, everybody?
[01:58:38.979 --> 01:58:45.100]  We're in Princeton, New Jersey, and we are here at the corporate headquarters of Moderna, serving legal paperwork.
[01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:46.340]  Let's do it!
[01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:46.840]  Hi there.
[01:58:47.159 --> 01:58:48.859]  So we're with Team Humanity.
[01:58:48.939 --> 01:58:52.239]  We needed to serve some legal paperwork to somebody that works at Moderna.
[01:58:52.460 --> 01:58:53.960]  Okay, um, you guys are recording?
[01:58:54.279 --> 01:58:54.520]  Yeah.
[01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:55.840]  You guys have just gone outside.
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:56.840]  You can't record it yet.
[01:58:56.859 --> 01:58:57.060]  Okay.
[01:58:57.279 --> 01:59:01.520]  I mean, I'd rather have it on film that we're handing it to somebody, and they can say, turn off the camera.
[01:59:01.640 --> 01:59:05.920]  We can say, how about you stop murdering 100 million people?
[01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:06.779]  Motherf***er.
[01:59:06.899 --> 01:59:08.640]  It's your legal obligation to take it.
[01:59:08.739 --> 01:59:11.119]  This is technically obstruction of justice right here.
[01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:16.420]  We're just gonna leave it, and I suggest you guys take it.
[01:59:16.699 --> 01:59:25.539]  There has been enough cases of people who have had the vaccine, received the vaccine, and then suffered a stroke.
[01:59:25.659 --> 01:59:26.020]  Good afternoon.
[01:59:26.119 --> 01:59:30.100]  I have some legal paperwork here that we need to hand to somebody at Johnson& Johnson.
[01:59:30.340 --> 01:59:30.659]  Okay.
[01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:31.560]  Have a seat, please.
[01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:31.880]  Okay.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:32.680]  Thank you.
[01:59:32.859 --> 01:59:33.239]  Thank you.
[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:36.920]  You have been served, Johnson& Johnson.
[01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:40.260]  You have been served for crimes against humanity.
[01:59:40.819 --> 01:59:44.100]  Did we just have some legal paperwork that we needed to drop off?
[01:59:45.619 --> 01:59:46.260]  Yes.
[01:59:46.659 --> 01:59:48.420]  For Merck.
[01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:51.380]  It has to be any employee at Merck can accept it.
[01:59:51.979 --> 01:59:53.720]  He just got Merck'd.
[01:59:53.920 --> 02:00:06.239]  Bill Gates, who was overseeing this simulation, made a argument 1.1 billion shares of BioNTech vaccine, which led to the Pfizer vaccine.
[02:00:26.669 --> 02:00:27.949]  Hey, what's up?
[02:00:28.090 --> 02:00:30.409]  We're the World Health Organization World Headquarters, baby.
[02:00:30.689 --> 02:00:41.729]  When the next pandemic comes knocking, and it will, We must be ready to answer decisively, collectively, and equitably.
[02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:44.869]  Hello.
[02:00:45.590 --> 02:00:46.329]  My name's Scott.
[02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:48.449]  I just had some documents I had to sign.
[02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:52.869]  This is just some legal paperwork that we needed to hand off to somebody here at the World Health Organization.
[02:00:53.529 --> 02:00:55.369]  I mean, she said she don't want it.
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:56.880]  Okay, well, we'll take it then.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:57.359]  Okay.
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:00.600]  Okay, so we have to literally just leave it.
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:02.100]  I just have to leave it here.
[02:01:02.380 --> 02:01:07.939]  Well, no, that's the thing is that this is a legal proceeding that's already in the courts and we are just notifying.
[02:01:08.079 --> 02:01:10.119]  So you've legally been notified is the thing.
[02:01:10.859 --> 02:01:15.380]  And so discarding that or throwing that away is considered obstruction of justice.
[02:01:16.100 --> 02:01:17.020]  All right, so there you go.
[02:01:17.159 --> 02:01:20.479]  So the World Health Organization, you saw it, they refused to take our summons.
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:25.460]  This gentleman who we've met in the mailroom says, you can hear, get a photo of them.
[02:01:26.399 --> 02:01:30.199]  That lady obviously works at the World Health Organization and they're talking about it.
[02:01:30.539 --> 02:01:31.840]  And so they've accepted it.
[02:01:32.039 --> 02:01:37.699]  To join the lawsuit and find out more, simply go to humanitiesuit.com.
[02:01:37.859 --> 02:01:40.880]  Again, that is humanitiesuit.com.
[02:01:41.159 --> 02:01:43.619]  John Baum, reporting for InfoWars.
[02:01:47.070 --> 02:01:50.970]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Chase Geiser, your host today on The Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:50.970 --> 02:01:53.810]  I will be hosting the show tomorrow as well and some of Wednesday.
[02:01:53.970 --> 02:01:56.569]  I believe Mike Adams is going to be in studio on Wednesday as well.
[02:01:56.689 --> 02:01:59.909]  As some other guest hosts, Owen Schroer will be hosting some at the end of the week.
[02:02:00.090 --> 02:02:13.890]  We are going to be taking your calls for this hour before the great Gerald Salente takes over and hosts the fourth hour of the broadcast before the great and esteemed Owen Schroer takes over hosting The War Room at 3 o'clock Central until 6 o'clock p.m.
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:18.840]  So we've got more developments coming in on this shooting.
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:20.500]  I'm going to show you a clip.
[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:24.060]  Breaking, police chief gives update on the shooting in Wisconsin.
[02:02:24.539 --> 02:02:27.439]  Multiple victims with at least three people that have lost their lives.
[02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:30.699]  I'm hearing reports that it could be more now, including at least one juvenile.
[02:02:30.979 --> 02:02:32.840]  A minor child is believed to be the culprit.
[02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:35.880]  Other children, at least seven, were transported to the hospital.
[02:02:36.020 --> 02:02:37.140]  We're going to show this clip in a second.
[02:02:38.159 --> 02:02:44.619]  Owen Schroer asks the question, what are the odds this was another leftist trans-motivated incident?
[02:02:46.090 --> 02:02:50.029]  Active Shooting and Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, multiple injuries reported.
[02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:52.430]  Let's watch this update from the police chief.
[02:02:53.630 --> 02:02:55.350]  Kindergarten through 12th grade.
[02:02:56.170 --> 02:02:59.729]  Police are walking to the microphone, so let's take a listen.
[02:02:59.909 --> 02:03:03.890]  This has so far been a combination of local police and Dane County sheriffs.
[02:03:04.069 --> 02:03:04.529]  Let's listen.
[02:03:05.229 --> 02:03:10.310]  The media is to our community, but the truth is today is a sad, sad day.
[02:03:10.869 --> 02:03:29.310]  Not only for Madison, but for our entire country, where yet another police chief Press conference to speak about violence in our community, specifically in one of the places that's most sacred to me as someone who loves education and to someone who has children that are in schools.
[02:03:29.989 --> 02:03:31.510]  So I'm going to tell you what I know.
[02:03:31.789 --> 02:03:33.989]  I'll answer any questions that I can.
[02:03:34.130 --> 02:03:37.890]  There'll be a secondary briefing that our PIO will let you know about, okay?
[02:03:39.010 --> 02:03:51.069]  Today, around 1057 a.m., our officers were responding to a call of an active shooter at the Abundant Life Christian School here in Madison.
[02:03:51.390 --> 02:03:57.050]  When officers arrived, they found multiple victims suffering from gunshot wounds.
[02:03:57.630 --> 02:04:01.869]  We train on this almost quarterly.
[02:04:02.329 --> 02:04:07.670]  The last time we trained on this as commanders was approximately two weeks ago.
[02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:10.520]  The protocols are simple.
[02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:12.079]  Stop the killing.
[02:04:12.319 --> 02:04:13.439]  Stop the dying.
[02:04:13.939 --> 02:04:15.060]  Find out who's doing this.
[02:04:15.260 --> 02:04:16.739]  And the officers did that.
[02:04:16.859 --> 02:04:17.920]  And they did that adamantly.
[02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:25.859]  We had officers from around the county and around the state that came in support of this particular incident.
[02:04:26.779 --> 02:04:33.460]  Officers located a juvenile who they believe was responsible for this deceased in the building.
[02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:43.699]  Additionally, the officers began administering life-saving efforts to anyone who was wounded and making sure that those persons were transported.
[02:04:44.020 --> 02:04:51.539]  What we know is that a total of about seven persons were transported from the scene to area hospitals for treatment.
[02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:57.289]  We know that at least three people have lost their lives, including a juvenile person.
[02:04:58.369 --> 02:05:14.010]  I don't have any other information about those persons who have lost their lives, and I'm not going to release that until we have, of course, spoken with family members and ensuring that they are fully aware of this tragic, tragic scene that occurred today.
[02:05:14.739 --> 02:05:17.760]  I want to thank all of the law enforcement partners.
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:21.060]  All right, folks, we will keep you updated as news develops on this story.
[02:05:21.199 --> 02:05:22.220]  Obviously, a tragic shooting.
[02:05:22.579 --> 02:05:26.800]  It certainly reminds me quite a bit of what happened in Nashville at that Christian school.
[02:05:28.479 --> 02:05:31.199]  Obviously, it's a tragedy when anything like this happens.
[02:05:31.319 --> 02:05:35.020]  Let's go to calls and switch back to the drone conversation.
[02:05:35.319 --> 02:05:36.039]  Eric in New Jersey.
[02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:37.319]  Eric, what's on your mind?
[02:05:38.359 --> 02:05:38.979]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:05:39.220 --> 02:05:39.420]  Good.
[02:05:39.579 --> 02:05:40.000]  Thanks for calling.
[02:05:41.119 --> 02:05:41.500]  No problem.
[02:05:42.970 --> 02:05:49.470]  I just had a thought about the fact that nobody seems to be talking about the port shutdown.
[02:05:50.670 --> 02:05:56.390]  I'm from up here, and it was an odd strike, and it was short.
[02:05:57.289 --> 02:06:05.609]  And I did see people putting pictures where military vehicles had been placed at ports in certain areas.
[02:06:06.329 --> 02:06:09.630]  And it's just like the connection, it's like there might be something there.
[02:06:09.829 --> 02:06:10.750]  When did the port shut down?
[02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:17.180]  It wasn't long before the drone thing started.
[02:06:18.920 --> 02:06:22.000]  I don't have an exact date, but maybe like a month and a half ago.
[02:06:22.239 --> 02:06:23.159]  Okay, I'm here in October.
[02:06:24.699 --> 02:06:27.880]  Yeah, and it was up and down the East Coast.
[02:06:28.779 --> 02:06:32.779]  But the nature of it getting resolved so quick, it was odd.
[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:34.539]  Yes, yes, that's right.
[02:06:34.659 --> 02:06:36.859]  Now, have you noticed anything in the skies in New Jersey?
[02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:40.079]  You know what, I haven't.
[02:06:41.539 --> 02:06:42.779]  I don't spend a lot of time.
[02:06:42.899 --> 02:06:45.340]  I know people that live near a naval weapons station.
[02:06:45.659 --> 02:06:46.840]  They've sent me videos.
[02:06:47.260 --> 02:06:48.060]  It's definitely there.
[02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:49.319]  Yes.
[02:06:50.159 --> 02:06:54.060]  But I'm not going outside to, you know, necessarily check it out.
[02:06:54.359 --> 02:06:57.180]  It's already consuming enough of my mind.
[02:06:57.399 --> 02:06:58.340]  Yeah, I understand.
[02:06:58.479 --> 02:06:59.239]  What do you think is going on?
[02:07:01.699 --> 02:07:03.899]  Well, I think the timing...
[02:07:03.899 --> 02:07:07.619]  This started right after we fired the missiles into Russia.
[02:07:07.899 --> 02:07:08.159]  Yep.
[02:07:09.100 --> 02:07:11.939]  It's hard to not put those two pieces together.
[02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:21.380]  So whether it's a defense array or something, I mean, it's all speculation.
[02:07:21.420 --> 02:07:23.380]  It's really hard to make sense of it.
[02:07:24.539 --> 02:07:25.539]  No, I'm with you on that.
[02:07:25.659 --> 02:07:28.300]  I think it's very suspicious, the timing of it as well.
[02:07:28.460 --> 02:07:29.539]  Eric, thank you so much for your call.
[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:30.159]  I appreciate it.
[02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:31.159]  Flatliner in Wisconsin.
[02:07:31.340 --> 02:07:32.279]  Flatliner, what's on your mind?
[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:34.279]  Hey, Chase, how you doing?
[02:07:34.420 --> 02:07:37.920]  Yeah, I wanted to talk about the guest you had on.
[02:07:39.109 --> 02:08:05.170]  And regarding the UAP, UAV, UFO situation we're in, I think the U.S. military, even way back when Nikola Tesla was working on this stuff, is making this technology to compete and get involved with the demonic world and spiritual world.
[02:08:05.529 --> 02:08:05.930]  Really?
[02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:11.850]  You think it's tied into some of the DMT experiments and things like that, where we're trying to tap into other dimensions and get intelligence?
[02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:30.829]  Well, more so over where they have, like, these robots and drones to kind of try to compete with the demonic world because they said that, like, demons can move so fast that you can only see them with a strobe light.
[02:08:30.930 --> 02:08:32.630]  You know, they're incredibly fast.
[02:08:33.270 --> 02:08:33.609]  Yeah.
[02:08:33.770 --> 02:08:37.989]  So the only way you could kind of compete with that is with advanced technology.
[02:08:39.289 --> 02:08:44.649]  So you think our government has identified intelligence that's not necessarily of the afterlife?
[02:08:44.970 --> 02:08:45.329]  Go ahead.
[02:08:46.029 --> 02:08:48.310]  I think our government is aware of the afterlife.
[02:08:48.810 --> 02:08:48.989]  Yeah.
[02:08:50.289 --> 02:08:51.210]  Well, that's fascinating.
[02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:53.810]  So are you glad the government's looking into it?
[02:08:53.829 --> 02:08:54.449]  Are you concerned?
[02:08:54.689 --> 02:09:00.609]  Because it seems to me that our government is as culpable for evil as demons themselves most of the time.
[02:09:02.579 --> 02:09:03.939]  Well, both.
[02:09:04.039 --> 02:09:06.180]  It depends on what they're going to do with the knowledge.
[02:09:06.619 --> 02:09:12.380]  You know, there was a CIA whistleblower that was in communication with the afterlife.
[02:09:12.859 --> 02:09:25.359]  J.P. Morgan was talking directly to Nikola Tesla to use his portal gateway technology to open up a portal to hell and get his family members out of hell.
[02:09:26.279 --> 02:09:26.880]  Wow.
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.119]  And obviously Nikola Tesla was like, I'm not going to do that, you know.
[02:09:30.530 --> 02:09:30.850]  Right.
[02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:32.630]  Well, thank you, Flatliner, for your call.
[02:09:32.729 --> 02:09:33.229]  I appreciate it.
[02:09:33.329 --> 02:09:33.930]  Ian in Connecticut.
[02:09:34.149 --> 02:09:35.069]  Ian, what's on your mind?
[02:09:38.029 --> 02:09:38.670]  Go ahead, Ian.
[02:09:38.710 --> 02:09:38.970]  Are you there?
[02:09:39.909 --> 02:09:40.229]  Yeah.
[02:09:40.329 --> 02:09:40.750]  Hey, Chase.
[02:09:40.869 --> 02:09:41.189]  What's up?
[02:09:41.369 --> 02:09:41.670]  What's up?
[02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:42.569]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:09:42.770 --> 02:09:42.970]  Sure.
[02:09:43.109 --> 02:09:45.829]  So, I've got some experience flying drones.
[02:09:46.630 --> 02:09:49.789]  Back a couple years ago, I was just kind of testing the waters to see...
[02:09:50.529 --> 02:09:55.050]  You know, how much he can fly in a place like New York City, which the whole thing is supposed to be geofenced.
[02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:58.649]  But at the time, I don't know, it's changed a few times.
[02:09:58.710 --> 02:10:02.850]  Like, when I go back sometimes and check it out, it's like sometimes I can take off and sometimes it won't let me.
[02:10:03.970 --> 02:10:08.149]  But it seems like the rivers, it lets you take off in the rivers, and sometimes it doesn't.
[02:10:09.219 --> 02:10:12.060]  But I don't see these things happening in New Jersey.
[02:10:12.239 --> 02:10:14.359]  These aren't DJI drones.
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:15.479]  These things are huge.
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:18.600]  I've seen the videos of them.
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:21.279]  That's not something you buy on Amazon.
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:25.340]  It's probably some kind of testing thing.
[02:10:30.779 --> 02:10:33.199]  You're breaking up a little bit, Ian, but I'm with you on that.
[02:10:33.359 --> 02:10:37.819]  I mean, some people are reporting that these drones are the size of a car, if not larger.
[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:46.060]  We know that we've had experts who are military contractors have reported about these drones, basically saying that they look like military drones.
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:47.600]  And so I agree with you.
[02:10:47.699 --> 02:10:49.100]  I think this is military stuff.
[02:10:49.199 --> 02:10:54.039]  That would explain why certain consumer-grade drones are unable to take off.
[02:10:56.910 --> 02:11:05.770]  Prohibitive frequency going out, blocking consumers from launching their own drones that their military drones can then bypass so only they can fly and we can't fly.
[02:11:05.890 --> 02:11:06.529]  And I'm with you on that.
[02:11:06.609 --> 02:11:08.329]  Let's go to John in Washington.
[02:11:08.510 --> 02:11:09.250]  John, what's on your mind?
[02:11:11.210 --> 02:11:11.850]  Hey, Chase.
[02:11:11.930 --> 02:11:12.329]  How you doing?
[02:11:12.510 --> 02:11:12.670]  Good.
[02:11:12.789 --> 02:11:13.149]  Thanks for calling.
[02:11:14.810 --> 02:11:15.430]  Thank you.
[02:11:15.649 --> 02:11:23.449]  I was listening to Britt there and he's talking about the seance, the gray ball he saw that disappeared and traveled.
[02:11:23.949 --> 02:11:24.789]  I was in church.
[02:11:24.989 --> 02:11:26.210]  We were in church having fellowship.
[02:11:26.430 --> 02:11:33.409]  We had a guest speaker come in, and he asked for appealing people to come forward for a prayer, and a woman stepped forward, Sister Bacon.
[02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:35.550]  They were praying for her.
[02:11:35.710 --> 02:11:52.149]  All of a sudden, this gray, like size of a grapefruit appeared upon the wall, hovered there, and I pointed to a brother and said, hey, look at that, and it traveled to our right and went out the door, and Sister Bacon took off her glasses and never put glasses on since.
[02:11:52.860 --> 02:11:54.239]  Wow, so she was cured?
[02:11:56.319 --> 02:11:57.699]  Right there, right in front of us.
[02:11:58.119 --> 02:12:05.939]  But this crazy thing appeared on the wall, and I've never seen that before, and it traveled, I don't know, 10-15 feet and went out the door.
[02:12:06.460 --> 02:12:07.520]  Wow, that's wild.
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:09.079]  John, thanks for calling in and sharing that story.
[02:12:09.199 --> 02:12:11.140]  Chad, Chad, let's go to you.
[02:12:11.420 --> 02:12:12.220]  What's on your mind?
[02:12:13.399 --> 02:12:14.439]  Good afternoon, Chase.
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:15.220]  Good afternoon.
[02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:23.420]  Calling about CBRN and this Drone situation.
[02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:44.000]  CBRN, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear, is pretty much the control under that is BARDA, which is under ASPR, which is under HHS. I'm assuming maybe this drone is some type of military operation,
[02:12:44.039 --> 02:12:45.140]  maybe it's a dry run.
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:13:01.409]  They're testing, but I would like to take into consideration that there are drones that can test for biological entities, you know, anything that's out there, chemical, radiological, all sorts of things,
[02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:01.689]  right?
[02:13:02.350 --> 02:13:09.989]  And I'm just curious, you know, you see some of the footage where drones are what it looks like, maybe tracers.
[02:13:10.609 --> 02:13:19.449]  But, you know, you start to think, like, maybe, are they practicing, like, if they lose one of their drones, they don't want that technology to be captured, maybe blow it up, you know?
[02:13:19.890 --> 02:13:21.050]  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.
[02:13:21.770 --> 02:13:32.170]  And then say, okay, well, some of these commercial where you see, maybe some people were flying commercial, and the military operation didn't want them being filmed, so they just took them out.
[02:13:32.970 --> 02:13:36.550]  And if that falls, yeah, okay, you pick that up, that's just commercial, cool.
[02:13:37.410 --> 02:13:52.470]  I'm concerned that this might, and I'm not trying to claim that this might, but there's all this talk about a black swan event, and this might be two-pronged, where you say, you know, one might be nuclear, what everybody's talking about, and this other might be a factor,
[02:13:52.750 --> 02:13:59.460]  and if RFK Jr. gets into HHS... All the biological stuff goes away.
[02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:00.539]  Hopefully, right?
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:01.319]  Cross our fingers.
[02:14:01.779 --> 02:14:01.960]  Right.
[02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:04.140]  So I'm concerned about that situation.
[02:14:04.420 --> 02:14:19.399]  And one last thing, in case it is something that's biological, hemorrhagic fever, if you go on to the PrEP Act on HHS, there are listings there as to what they have proposed in advance.
[02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:31.680]  Zika virus, pandemic influenza, anthrax, acute radiation syndrome, We're good to go.
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:43.920]  We're good to go.
[02:14:50.990 --> 02:14:52.130]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:14:52.670 --> 02:14:56.970]  I mean, honestly, the best thing you can do is just do everything you can to support your immune system.
[02:14:58.369 --> 02:15:00.510]  And here's what's terrifying to me about this.
[02:15:00.569 --> 02:15:11.949]  If we look at everything that the government has done in the last four years with the COVID pandemic, a manufactured pandemic with a manufactured virus, gain-of-function research funded by Fauci and others.
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:14.199]  We know this.
[02:15:14.439 --> 02:15:19.319]  And then they push the vaccine, which is even more harmful than the virus itself.
[02:15:19.539 --> 02:15:22.800]  We've all been victims of a biological weapon attack.
[02:15:22.979 --> 02:15:28.600]  Anybody who had COVID and anybody who got vaccinated has been victims of the response, the unjust response to it.
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:38.310]  Plus, we have all the proof now that over the last several years and before, But especially under this Biden administration, they've actively interfered with our freedom of speech on the internet.
[02:15:38.430 --> 02:15:40.010]  So they're attacking our freedom of speech.
[02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:42.270]  They're attacking our right to bear arms.
[02:15:42.529 --> 02:15:45.649]  They're literally attacking us with biological weapons.
[02:15:46.149 --> 02:15:50.289]  And then they're attacking us with a fake cure or treatment after the fact.
[02:15:51.130 --> 02:16:06.970]  They're trying to escalate World War III. We know that the number one way you could escalate to World War III and get people on board with it is if there was a dirty bomb or some radioactive explosion in the United States, all while they're simultaneously saying that the day after Trump is inaugurated, there's going to be another pandemic with viruses that they named,
[02:16:07.090 --> 02:16:09.770]  these experts, these so-called experts just naming every virus imaginable.
[02:16:09.869 --> 02:16:11.689]  So they're trying to terrify us with these drones.
[02:16:11.890 --> 02:16:16.390]  They're trying to terrify us with a potential new pandemic, even though the last one was all foe.
[02:16:17.250 --> 02:16:18.430]  They're trying to silence us.
[02:16:18.550 --> 02:16:19.789]  They're trying to disarm us.
[02:16:21.170 --> 02:16:27.670]  And they're trying to escalate to World War III, and they've only got, what, 34 days left to pull it off?
[02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:30.689]  I mean, all this just makes sense that it's happening right now.
[02:16:30.770 --> 02:16:32.350]  It's all unfolding right before our eyes.
[02:16:32.409 --> 02:16:34.750]  These are really scary times.
[02:16:35.850 --> 02:16:40.049]  I mean, I've got Bill Gates out here talking about killing all the cows.
[02:16:40.149 --> 02:16:40.969]  This is clip number nine.
[02:16:41.530 --> 02:16:47.489]  Six percent of emissions are from cows, so we have to figure out a way to make factory beef instead of using cows.
[02:16:47.610 --> 02:16:47.969]  Clip number nine.
[02:16:48.069 --> 02:16:48.549]  Let's watch this.
[02:16:49.659 --> 02:16:55.840]  Australia's very blessed, whether it's wind or solar, you know, it's quite phenomenal.
[02:16:56.100 --> 02:17:01.420]  And your land area per person, you know, compared to, say, Singapore's, is pretty good.
[02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:04.500]  And so, the...
[02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:16.299]  The opportunities created by a world that is getting rid of greenhouse gas emissions, Australia is rare in that the opportunities exceed the things you have to give up.
[02:17:16.399 --> 02:17:22.840]  You have to give up a large part of the, and eventually almost all of the coal mining activity.
[02:17:23.799 --> 02:17:40.790]  You know, what happens with beef, my climate This group, Breakthrough Energy, just announced literally today an investment in an Australian group called Ruminate that helps cows not be so much a source of methane emissions.
[02:17:41.069 --> 02:17:43.149]  So we have two paths to solving that.
[02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:45.750]  That's 6% of global emissions are cows.
[02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:51.260]  Who burp and fart methane to an extreme degree.
[02:17:52.239 --> 02:17:58.540]  You can either fix the cows to stop them doing that, or you can make beef without the cow.
[02:17:58.700 --> 02:18:09.000]  And both of those will be pursued to see which one can lead to the best product in terms of taste, health, and cost.
[02:18:12.850 --> 02:18:14.209]  Well, there you have it.
[02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.989]  Bill Gates again.
[02:18:15.569 --> 02:18:16.569]  Talking about the same thing.
[02:18:16.649 --> 02:18:18.569]  Jake in Ohio, what do you think about Trump and the inauguration?
[02:18:20.969 --> 02:18:29.889]  I think he needs to get as many world leaders there as he can, especially their dear Xi Jinping, because they certainly will not attack the Capitol if he is there.
[02:18:31.069 --> 02:18:40.030]  And if you want proof, as good a proof as you can get as far as extraterrestrial life goes, check out a book called The Ringmakers of Saturn.
[02:18:40.549 --> 02:18:42.989]  It left me speechless, dude.
[02:18:43.170 --> 02:18:50.790]  And it's written by the guy that kind of founded NASA and invented the Cassini space probe.
[02:18:51.049 --> 02:18:56.670]  And this thing has pictures of something building the rings of Saturn.
[02:18:57.549 --> 02:18:58.229]  Really?
[02:18:58.450 --> 02:19:00.229]  So the argument in the book is that they're manufactured?
[02:19:01.309 --> 02:19:02.270]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:19:02.409 --> 02:19:08.819]  The guy that invented the Cassini space probe Wrote the book, and he explains everything.
[02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:15.139]  He's got little arrows in the pictures and what these things are, you know, and there's such a massive scale.
[02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:18.540]  I mean, it is just unbelievable.
[02:19:19.260 --> 02:19:19.799]  That is unbelievable.
[02:19:19.899 --> 02:19:22.559]  I always thought the rings of Saturn were composed of lost airline luggage.
[02:19:26.379 --> 02:19:31.040]  Hey, another good book, dude, The Secret Destiny of America, manned by Banley P. Hall.
[02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:32.420]  Amazing, dude.
[02:19:32.620 --> 02:19:33.879]  Yeah, I like Maley P. Hall a lot.
[02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:34.940]  Yeah, that's good stuff.
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:39.020]  So, this book convinced you of the existence of extraterrestrial life?
[02:19:39.399 --> 02:19:43.020]  As far as I'm concerned, it's probably about the best proof that we have.
[02:19:43.719 --> 02:19:51.920]  Because it's in, I mean, it's from space, there are pictures from the space probes, and you can see them building the rings of Saturn.
[02:19:52.100 --> 02:19:56.360]  And the rings of Saturn are weird, because I guess they change size and thickness.
[02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:59.069]  And you can see it through your telescope.
[02:19:59.250 --> 02:20:01.430]  It's some amazing stuff, man.
[02:20:01.610 --> 02:20:04.729]  What do you think about this drone phenomenon that we're experiencing?
[02:20:05.790 --> 02:20:08.110]  I think it's all BS. Smoke and mirrors.
[02:20:08.549 --> 02:20:12.670]  I think there is something to that missing nuke.
[02:20:13.809 --> 02:20:14.610]  Yeah, I think so too.
[02:20:14.770 --> 02:20:17.649]  And that's why I'd say he needs to get Xi Jinping and all them guys.
[02:20:18.569 --> 02:20:21.549]  Put Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates right there beside him.
[02:20:21.549 --> 02:20:28.370]  Yeah, if they all decline the invitation, then it'll certainly make people wonder whether or not something bad is going to happen there.
[02:20:28.450 --> 02:20:30.129]  Ms. Liu in Florida, Ms. Liu, what's on your mind?
[02:20:32.829 --> 02:20:35.350]  Hey, I can hear you.
[02:20:35.370 --> 02:20:35.750]  Are you there?
[02:20:36.690 --> 02:20:37.270]  Okay, good.
[02:20:37.409 --> 02:20:37.809]  Yeah, I'm here.
[02:20:37.989 --> 02:20:38.350]  Very good.
[02:20:39.350 --> 02:20:42.510]  Listen, I agree with smoke and mirrors.
[02:20:42.860 --> 02:20:46.540]  But here's the thing, and you had Dark on one of your programs, I think, with Alex.
[02:20:46.799 --> 02:20:48.180]  Yeah, and he's going to be hosting this Thursday.
[02:20:49.239 --> 02:20:50.340]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:20:50.819 --> 02:20:56.860]  All this chaos, all this stuff going on, whether they're hunting for a nuclear thing, there's test sites all over.
[02:20:56.959 --> 02:20:59.299]  Apparently, New Jersey's huge for this kind of testing.
[02:20:59.579 --> 02:20:59.719]  Yeah.
[02:21:00.059 --> 02:21:03.739]  But the chaos, it's meant for fear porn.
[02:21:03.739 --> 02:21:11.600]  But now people are so inundated with chaos, they're like, it's almost being normalized, which has another danger to it.
[02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:22.819]  In any case, I think the continuation of government, the COG that was apparently put in by Cheney Bush around the time of 9-11, they're trying to ramp that up again.
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:28.899]  And I think they'll do anything they can between now and the 20th to nullify Trump's presidency.
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:43.889]  And if they can create a false flag event or a real event that gets people off track, then they can come in and say, The government stays the same, the regime stays the same, martial law, that's it.
[02:21:44.290 --> 02:21:52.370]  We're taking over now because we have this thing happening, whether it's UFOs or World War III or whatever.
[02:21:52.750 --> 02:21:57.389]  Well, that is 100% over the target, Ms. Liu, because people forget they already tried to kill him twice.
[02:21:58.280 --> 02:22:04.479]  With the Crooks guy whose house was professionally scrubbed, no silverware in his house afterwards, no other reporting about him whatsoever.
[02:22:04.479 --> 02:22:09.860]  All the cell phone data about where he'd been training, who he'd been associated with is very bizarre, very alarming.
[02:22:10.100 --> 02:22:11.280]  No one's ever talking about it.
[02:22:11.379 --> 02:22:15.520]  And then you have the Ryan Routh guy who's got his hair dyed like the colors of the Ukraine flag.
[02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:17.139]  You think he's deep state MK ultra op?
[02:22:17.219 --> 02:22:18.340]  It looked like it to me.
[02:22:18.500 --> 02:22:24.239]  And so if they tried to kill him twice already, then what would they be willing to do on January 20th?
[02:22:25.079 --> 02:22:28.040]  Well, the best line I've heard so far is they're not going to hand over the keys.
[02:22:28.739 --> 02:22:29.180]  Yeah.
[02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:35.420]  And you see, globalist communists will do anything, anything to maintain power.
[02:22:35.620 --> 02:22:39.719]  And by the way, Bill Gates, every time he opens his mouth, is 20% of messy.
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:45.360]  So, keep the cows and get rid of Bill Gates.
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:48.700]  That would be the first thing to fix climate change.
[02:22:49.100 --> 02:22:49.739]  Absolutely, Ms. Liu.
[02:22:49.819 --> 02:22:50.579]  Thank you so much for your call.
[02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:52.180]  Folks, we're coming up on a break in 90 seconds.

[02:25:30.430 --> 02:25:35.170]  This is now available at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:25:35.329 --> 02:25:35.930]  It's amazing.
[02:25:36.110 --> 02:25:38.010]  And then separately, everybody wanted it.
[02:25:38.110 --> 02:25:38.590]  You got it.

[02:25:48.489 --> 02:25:49.809]  Thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:25:50.450 --> 02:25:53.610]  And then, you can't get it before Christmas to start shipping.
[02:25:53.809 --> 02:25:57.430]  Everybody that ordered will get it before Christmas, but more is coming in, but it won't ship till the 23rd.
[02:25:57.670 --> 02:26:00.209]  You still order Trump on a Stump Elf.
[02:26:00.290 --> 02:26:02.670]  It'll be great year-round, but great for next year as well.
[02:26:02.829 --> 02:26:20.500]  But more of those coming the 23rd, you can pre-order that We did just get an update from our command post.
[02:26:20.719 --> 02:26:23.319]  Five deceased at this time, five injured.
[02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:30.020]  Again, this is an ever-evolving situation.
[02:26:32.569 --> 02:26:35.530]  Just hearing that, what does that make you think?
[02:26:35.670 --> 02:26:36.649]  How does that make you feel?
[02:26:36.930 --> 02:26:46.909]  That we have to do a better job in our community on a Monday, so close to Christmas, that we're updating victims.
[02:26:47.430 --> 02:26:52.770]  And so there's a lot of work that has to be done, and we're committed to doing that work.
[02:26:52.950 --> 02:26:54.049]  We just ask for your patience.
[02:26:54.709 --> 02:27:05.409]  I think the most important part is the reunification, again, that we spoke about, making sure that those persons who are in the schools, whether they're staff, whether they're staff, students.
[02:27:05.610 --> 02:27:10.790]  And Nick Sorter just posted a short eight-second clip about 12 minutes ago, about 14 minutes ago or so.
[02:27:11.459 --> 02:27:15.819]  This same police chief said he doesn't know whether or not the culprit was male or female.
[02:27:16.059 --> 02:27:20.399]  And now I'm not sure if he doesn't know because he doesn't know, or I'm not sure if he doesn't know because they couldn't tell.
[02:27:20.979 --> 02:27:23.840]  We'll see more developments to keep you updated.
[02:27:24.059 --> 02:27:29.840]  Just in, Canadian Prime Minister is considering resigning imminently per CTV News.
[02:27:30.079 --> 02:27:36.659]  This comes just days after Trump clowned on Trudeau, calling him the governor of the 51st state of Canada.
[02:27:37.350 --> 02:27:42.489]  Even Canada is sick of the leftist BS as Trudeau has become wildly unpopular as Prime Minister.
[02:27:44.549 --> 02:27:46.930]  According to this report, Freeland resigns.
[02:27:47.010 --> 02:27:49.209]  Trudeau considering his options as leader, according to sources.
[02:27:49.389 --> 02:27:55.989]  Trudeau's considering his options as leader, sources tell CTV News after Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland revealed she will quit Cabinet.
[02:27:56.229 --> 02:28:10.950]  In an explosive resignation letter published Monday morning, Freeland ignited a storm of confusion and speculation on Parliament Hill the same day she was set to table her fall economic statement, a document that typically includes key economic metrics such as size of Canada's deficit.
[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:14.540]  We'll keep you updated as that story develops as well.
[02:28:14.879 --> 02:28:16.399]  And the crew just put this on my desk.
[02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:21.360]  This is interesting in conjunction with the drone stuff that we've been covering.
[02:28:21.940 --> 02:28:26.600]  Boston police arrest two men accused of hazardous drone operation.
[02:28:28.010 --> 02:28:35.350]  Amid multiple reports of possible drone activity over Massachusetts, the Boston Police Department arrested two men who are accused of hazardous drone operation in the Boston Harbor Islands.
[02:28:35.670 --> 02:28:45.950]  Robert Duffy, 42 of Charlestown, and Jeremy Fulchick, 32 of Bridgewater, Massachusetts, were arrested Saturday night by the Boston Police Harbor Patrol Unit on Long Island, which is part of the Boston Harbor Islands.
[02:28:46.649 --> 02:28:52.950]  Police said that the two men were operating the drone near Logan Airport's airspace, and they now face charges of trespassing with additional fines.
[02:28:53.889 --> 02:28:55.709]  The incident began around 4.30 p.m.
[02:28:55.870 --> 02:29:03.569]  Saturday, police said, when an officer specializing in real-time crime surveillance detected an unmanned aircraft system operating dangerously close to the Logan International Airport.
[02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:10.850]  They were able to identify the location by triangulating the signal, and apparently one of them took off in a boat.
[02:29:11.309 --> 02:29:12.110]  Very bizarre.
[02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:13.450]  Very bizarre stuff going on.
[02:29:13.530 --> 02:29:14.430]  All right, let's go back to the calls.
[02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:15.930]  James in Indiana.
[02:29:16.430 --> 02:29:17.149]  James, what's on your mind?
[02:29:19.120 --> 02:29:20.739]  Hey, we got some news coming out of Florida.
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.360]  The VA has been abusing the Baker's Act.
[02:29:23.559 --> 02:29:30.280]  And what that does is it puts a 72-hour involuntary mental health hold on somebody that's deemed a threat to themselves or others.
[02:29:30.520 --> 02:29:31.860]  They did this to a veteran.
[02:29:32.790 --> 02:29:36.350]  He said he'd never ask for help again, and then six months later ended up dead.
[02:29:36.610 --> 02:29:39.489]  Another veteran said, don't go to the VA or they will just kill you.
[02:29:39.729 --> 02:29:42.149]  This is just other news agencies are picking up on that.
[02:29:42.149 --> 02:29:42.829]  Wow, that's crazy.
[02:29:42.989 --> 02:29:48.670]  Well, and it's all in the context of Canada now reporting that one in 20 of its deaths last year were euthanasia.
[02:29:48.809 --> 02:29:55.850]  And so you wonder if the VA is actually trying to help people or if it's just part of this euthanasia, depopulation, dehuman, anti-human agenda.
[02:29:56.110 --> 02:29:56.870]  Thanks for your call, James.
[02:29:57.030 --> 02:29:57.889]  I'm so sorry to hear about that.
[02:29:58.030 --> 02:29:58.889]  Daryl in North Carolina.
[02:29:59.090 --> 02:29:59.889]  Daryl, what's on your mind?
[02:30:00.889 --> 02:30:01.370]  Hey, Chase.
[02:30:01.590 --> 02:30:05.629]  I was going to call about the drones, but I'm seeing this breaking news out of France.
[02:30:05.950 --> 02:30:09.010]  The island of Mayotte, which is off of Africa.
[02:30:09.209 --> 02:30:10.069]  It's a French region.
[02:30:10.430 --> 02:30:13.729]  It looks like the weather weapons have struck again.
[02:30:13.989 --> 02:30:16.409]  They say that there's thousands feared dead.
[02:30:16.409 --> 02:30:19.709]  It's from a cyclone, which I guess is like a hurricane to us.
[02:30:20.049 --> 02:30:23.549]  And, of course, it only hit the poorest region of France.
[02:30:24.039 --> 02:30:28.659]  It's absolutely a poorest region located on what looks like a really nice tropical island.
[02:30:28.840 --> 02:30:33.860]  So it looks to me like weather weapons again and clearing out an area for a smart city.
[02:30:34.360 --> 02:30:34.799]  Wow.
[02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:35.899]  Crazy, Derek.
[02:30:35.940 --> 02:30:36.819]  What do you think about these drones?
[02:30:36.940 --> 02:30:37.579]  Tell me about that, too.
[02:30:38.579 --> 02:30:39.040]  Oh, okay.
[02:30:39.139 --> 02:30:39.680]  So the drones.
[02:30:39.819 --> 02:30:40.459]  So check it out, man.
[02:30:40.479 --> 02:30:43.520]  I've been following these drones and also the orbs of light.
[02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:51.139]  So I think there's military-grade drones chasing the orbs of light because in 1942, there was the Battle of Los Angeles.
[02:30:51.680 --> 02:30:56.420]  Thousands of people reported seeing these orbs of light going all over the sky.
[02:30:56.680 --> 02:31:02.239]  The military freaked out, fired thousands of rounds into the air, and then a few days later said, ah, it was nothing.
[02:31:02.379 --> 02:31:03.920]  People just saw, you know, whatever.
[02:31:04.299 --> 02:31:05.319]  Just like they're doing now.
[02:31:05.479 --> 02:31:13.200]  And also, those orbs of light, you can see video of them going in and out of Mount Popocateli volcano in Mexico.
[02:31:13.799 --> 02:31:15.020]  And there's video of that.
[02:31:15.180 --> 02:31:25.100]  So there's a difference between these round orbs that go thousands of miles an hour in all these directions and then the mechanical drones that are kind of following them.
[02:31:25.299 --> 02:31:26.040]  That's what I think.
[02:31:26.780 --> 02:31:27.760]  Wow, crazy stuff.
[02:31:27.879 --> 02:31:30.379]  Now, do you think it's a PSYOP? Do you think it's a defensive array?
[02:31:30.420 --> 02:31:31.700]  Do you think they're looking for a dirty bomb?
[02:31:31.819 --> 02:31:32.739]  I mean, what's going on?
[02:31:33.780 --> 02:31:46.639]  I like all those theories, but also if you look back, even from the 50s all the way through the 80s, whenever Russia and America were about to nuke each other, they would see these glowing orbs that would come over and shut down the nuclear facilities.
[02:31:46.940 --> 02:31:52.319]  I'm thinking if there's about to be a nuclear event, these balls of light are going to shut it down before it happens.
[02:31:52.440 --> 02:31:56.180]  Because for whatever reason, I think it doesn't just affect us, it affects them as well.
[02:31:56.600 --> 02:31:57.540]  Great call, Daryl.
[02:31:57.639 --> 02:31:58.159]  I appreciate it.
[02:31:58.340 --> 02:31:59.200]  Taylor in Idaho.
[02:31:59.399 --> 02:32:00.340]  Taylor, what's on your mind?
[02:32:01.809 --> 02:32:02.469]  Hey, Chase.
[02:32:02.969 --> 02:32:03.670]  Thanks for calling.
[02:32:04.010 --> 02:32:06.069]  Yeah, I agree with the last caller.
[02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:10.389]  I think yours and Britt's analysis were really good.
[02:32:12.229 --> 02:32:15.090]  Yeah, there's something weird going on for sure.
[02:32:15.469 --> 02:32:32.190]  But I guess, you know, I just want to make the point that they totally have this technology, like this super advanced flying saucer technology Technology.
[02:32:32.450 --> 02:32:39.069]  That's how I woke up to InfoWars and just the New World Order.
[02:32:39.250 --> 02:32:41.290]  I was totally asleep.
[02:32:41.530 --> 02:32:59.950]  And when I lived in Colorado Springs, I actually saw what you would describe as a flying saucer and went down the rabbit hole and just found Alex Jones and Bill Cooper and Never looked back.
[02:33:00.069 --> 02:33:07.350]  But that was in 2011. So, I mean, yeah, they're testing stuff all the time.
[02:33:07.489 --> 02:33:14.409]  And Colorado Springs, you know, has got NORAD and a bunch of Air Force bases and Army base.
[02:33:14.690 --> 02:33:18.270]  And whatever it is, they know about it.
[02:33:18.430 --> 02:33:20.069]  They know about it.
[02:33:20.209 --> 02:33:22.450]  And, I mean, I think it's us.
[02:33:23.219 --> 02:33:27.159]  And you can have the debate where it came from, but like, yeah.
[02:33:27.659 --> 02:33:37.500]  Well, and if you've seen Trump's statement from today, even he implied it was very obvious that the intelligence that he received was that our government knows exactly what's going on.
[02:33:37.879 --> 02:33:39.520]  And it's even implied that it's us.
[02:33:39.620 --> 02:33:44.399]  In fact, we actually have a new report just in from Alex Jones talking about Trump's statement.
[02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:46.280]  I want to run that and then go to more calls.
[02:33:46.319 --> 02:33:47.520]  Taylor, thank you so much for your call.
[02:33:47.620 --> 02:33:49.340]  I appreciate it and your support as a listener.
[02:33:52.989 --> 02:33:54.770]  Trump just came out an hour ago.
[02:33:54.950 --> 02:34:04.350]  We're about to play a statement with an extremely important response to the drone hysteria taking place across the United States right now.
[02:34:04.510 --> 02:34:07.250]  And he basically restated exactly what I've been saying.
[02:34:07.489 --> 02:34:08.809]  There is no mystery.
[02:34:09.110 --> 02:34:10.370]  The mystery is solved.
[02:34:11.329 --> 02:34:13.170]  These are drones.
[02:34:13.469 --> 02:34:14.389]  These are human made.
[02:34:14.569 --> 02:34:17.809]  The Pentagon knows exactly where they're coming from, where they're going.
[02:34:18.309 --> 02:34:25.129]  They're showing particular interest in his Westminster golf course club, a state area where he was already planning to go in a few days.
[02:34:25.129 --> 02:34:26.590]  He says he's canceled his trip there.
[02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:28.739]  He says they're not a foreign adversary.
[02:34:29.139 --> 02:34:33.159]  And he says that the president, the current president, Biden, has been read in and knows.
[02:34:33.399 --> 02:34:34.940]  And they say, well, have you been given a security briefing?
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:36.139]  He says, I won't comment on that.
[02:34:36.399 --> 02:34:40.459]  He's telling you what he's been told in the security briefing because he is the president-elect.
[02:34:40.719 --> 02:34:43.819]  This is exactly what I did, a two-hour special report last night.
[02:34:44.299 --> 02:34:47.600]  Mystery of the UAV drone hysteria solved.
[02:34:47.860 --> 02:34:55.260]  And I laid out the legislation they're trying to pass right now that would ban all civilian use of drones, have monopoly of big corporations and government over it.
[02:34:55.690 --> 02:34:56.770]  This is a big deal.
[02:34:56.909 --> 02:34:59.110]  This is a PSYOP ahead of Trump getting in in 34 days.
[02:34:59.709 --> 02:35:00.770]  Trump understands that.
[02:35:00.930 --> 02:35:03.270]  This is a dead-on statement from Trump.
[02:35:03.409 --> 02:35:14.170]  From all the research and sources I have, I have a lot of Pentagon sources, a lot of corporate sources in Aeronautics, Space Aeronautics, they confirm this is a giant PSYOP. They may crash into a plane.
[02:35:14.329 --> 02:35:15.270]  They may attack somebody.
[02:35:15.510 --> 02:35:17.430]  They're also promoting that nukes are missing.
[02:35:17.690 --> 02:35:21.270]  I've warned they may get nukes ahead of Trump getting in and blaming on Russia or Iran.
[02:35:21.430 --> 02:35:22.629]  And now that's happening.
[02:35:22.829 --> 02:35:27.049]  This is a giant psyop, just like COVID, just like all this different crap.
[02:35:27.329 --> 02:35:32.090]  So they got a lot of tracks trying to stop Trump and trying to change the agenda for Make America Great Again.
[02:35:32.629 --> 02:35:34.370]  The globalists are desperate.
[02:35:34.569 --> 02:35:35.860]  His cabinet is They're powerful.
[02:35:36.059 --> 02:35:40.760]  They know Trump's coming in to restore our republic and punish the wrongdoers so they can't do it again.
[02:35:41.420 --> 02:35:50.340]  And we're gonna keep watching this whole UAP UFO hysteria very, very closely with live reports here and a real Alex Jones on X. So follow this and share this report.
[02:35:50.479 --> 02:35:53.559]  Here is the president's statement that I just broke down for you.
[02:35:53.819 --> 02:35:57.459]  Can you comment on the drones that are flying around New Jersey's reports?
[02:35:57.879 --> 02:36:00.000]  It seems like the American people have a big disk.
[02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:02.620]  The government knows what is happening.
[02:36:05.389 --> 02:36:07.889]  Our military knows where they took off from.
[02:36:08.809 --> 02:36:11.450]  If it's a garage, they can go right into that garage.
[02:36:11.709 --> 02:36:14.409]  They know where it came from and where it went.
[02:36:15.370 --> 02:36:17.489]  And for some reason, they don't want to comment.
[02:36:18.069 --> 02:36:20.309]  And I think they'd be better off saying what it is.
[02:36:20.430 --> 02:36:23.010]  Our military knows and our president knows.
[02:36:23.790 --> 02:36:26.329]  And for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense.
[02:36:26.809 --> 02:36:30.989]  I can't imagine it's the enemy, because if it was the enemy, they'd blast it out.
[02:36:31.090 --> 02:36:32.750]  Even if they were late, they'd blast it.
[02:36:34.470 --> 02:36:35.930]  Something strange is going on.
[02:36:36.010 --> 02:36:37.750]  For some reason, they don't want to tell the people.
[02:36:37.930 --> 02:36:39.850]  And they should, because the people are really...
[02:36:39.850 --> 02:36:42.129]  I mean, they happen to be over Bedminster.
[02:36:43.309 --> 02:36:47.049]  They're very close to Bedminster.
[02:36:47.149 --> 02:36:49.270]  I think maybe I won't spend the weekend in Bedminster.
[02:36:50.110 --> 02:36:51.850]  I've decided to cancel my trip.
[02:36:52.370 --> 02:36:54.290]  Have you received an intelligence briefing on the drones?
[02:36:54.610 --> 02:36:56.010]  I don't want to comment on that.
[02:36:56.649 --> 02:36:58.229]  All right, let's go to Mike in Alaska.
[02:36:58.510 --> 02:37:00.309]  Mike in Alaska, what is on your mind?
[02:37:02.550 --> 02:37:03.510]  Hello, Chase.
[02:37:03.629 --> 02:37:04.370]  Thank you for putting me on.
[02:37:04.469 --> 02:37:15.790]  I was on Coast to Coast last night describing what we saw in South Bay down in Manhattan Beach, the disappearing, the most wicked-looking flying wing traveling at 15,000.
[02:37:15.790 --> 02:37:19.549]  I calculated 15,000-plus miles an hour across.
[02:37:19.750 --> 02:37:22.870]  It disappeared right before it went to Catalina.
[02:37:23.469 --> 02:37:26.049]  But anyway, this is a Navy operation.
[02:37:26.370 --> 02:37:28.149]  I worked on the base.
[02:37:28.329 --> 02:37:29.350]  My son worked on the base.
[02:37:29.350 --> 02:37:30.450]  He actually moved the bombs.
[02:37:30.979 --> 02:37:32.559]  He put his hand on the Super Hornets.
[02:37:32.799 --> 02:37:38.180]  If you could please, right now, search China Lake Super Hornet drone drop.
[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:44.110]  Ten years ago, they dropped hundreds of drones They're so synced.
[02:37:44.370 --> 02:37:45.329]  They could be anything.
[02:37:45.530 --> 02:37:48.389]  They turn them into a swarm of bees, and not one of them hit each other.
[02:37:48.469 --> 02:37:49.030]  It's amazing.
[02:37:49.250 --> 02:37:50.370]  They turn them into an arrow.
[02:37:50.610 --> 02:37:54.850]  They turn them into a line across the desert, and they march the drones.
[02:37:55.069 --> 02:37:56.370]  And then they turn them into a circle.
[02:37:56.549 --> 02:38:00.350]  They go each direction, and then the circle chokes them down.
[02:38:00.670 --> 02:38:02.149]  It is amazing.
[02:38:02.729 --> 02:38:05.889]  But yeah, go to that, and China Lake...
[02:38:06.250 --> 02:38:07.270]  It's the home of the drones.
[02:38:07.450 --> 02:38:11.409]  My friend who has a desert patented gold mine out there.
[02:38:11.430 --> 02:38:13.030]  I'm a gold miner from Parabanks.
[02:38:13.129 --> 02:38:13.370]  You know that.
[02:38:13.489 --> 02:38:14.829]  But I mined out in Mojave too.
[02:38:15.489 --> 02:38:17.250]  And your first host is awesome.
[02:38:17.350 --> 02:38:18.889]  I really got to talk to that guy.
[02:38:19.129 --> 02:38:21.069]  And plus, I have a painting of what I saw.
[02:38:21.329 --> 02:38:26.670]  If I could email it to you, Chase, I'll email you the painting I just finished of what I saw.
[02:38:26.670 --> 02:38:28.610]  And I gave it to George Knapp.
[02:38:28.690 --> 02:38:31.010]  I'm going to send it to George Knapp on Coast to Coast.
[02:38:31.010 --> 02:38:32.129]  I'm a regular on the show.
[02:38:32.829 --> 02:38:33.190]  Anyway...
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:34.920]  China Lake has drones.
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:43.579]  She called the base commander once, complained about the Hornets pivoting off the cell tower she has in her backyard.
[02:38:43.899 --> 02:38:49.379]  She sold her corner, a little corner, for $300,000 for the cell tower.
[02:38:49.500 --> 02:38:55.180]  But anyway, the F-18s would do a horseshoe around the cell towers.
[02:38:55.180 --> 02:38:57.780]  And I lived up on a mountain across the way.
[02:38:57.819 --> 02:38:58.659]  I used to love it.
[02:38:58.979 --> 02:39:01.299]  The sound is so outrageous, so loud.
[02:39:01.459 --> 02:39:03.739]  I could see the pilot's goggles.
[02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:07.840]  But he called the base commander, and this is no lie.
[02:39:08.180 --> 02:39:12.100]  Within 10 minutes, a freaking drone would circle her house.
[02:39:12.399 --> 02:39:14.239]  The wickedest thing you've ever seen.
[02:39:14.979 --> 02:39:18.079]  My friend was five miles further out in the desert.
[02:39:18.079 --> 02:39:22.360]  He was crushing rocks in his gold mine, and he's seen all of a sudden...
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:24.479]  This is how they spy on it.
[02:39:24.559 --> 02:39:26.399]  The Navy is so corrupt right now.
[02:39:26.579 --> 02:39:28.180]  The Navy's behind all of this.
[02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:29.079]  Guess who runs the Navy?
[02:39:29.799 --> 02:39:35.239]  A woke woman named Admiral Lisa Franchetti.
[02:39:35.479 --> 02:39:36.659]  She needs to be fired.
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:39.700]  They need to completely drain.
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:41.819]  The Navy is so corrupt.
[02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:46.059]  You know, when they get a budget, they have to spend every penny.
[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:49.639]  They have warehouses- Right, they have to spend every penny, otherwise the budget won't get renewed the next year.
[02:39:50.469 --> 02:39:53.149]  You should see the warehouses out there, Chase.
[02:39:55.110 --> 02:39:57.909]  I moved the Admiral from his old digs to his new digs.
[02:39:58.010 --> 02:39:59.049]  And let me tell you something.
[02:39:59.129 --> 02:40:01.950]  China Lake is a city that is totally hidden.
[02:40:02.149 --> 02:40:03.270]  You cannot see it.
[02:40:03.350 --> 02:40:04.270]  That's why they put it there.
[02:40:04.430 --> 02:40:05.989]  It's impossible to drive to.
[02:40:06.190 --> 02:40:07.370]  You cannot get to it.
[02:40:07.729 --> 02:40:11.270]  When I think it was Chuck Hanger flew over the desert, he said, that's the spot.
[02:40:11.979 --> 02:40:17.459]  But anyway, my dad also worked at Area 51 on the first atomic rocket missile.
[02:40:17.659 --> 02:40:22.799]  He was a contractor after combat in World War II. He helped build the silos, but he passed away from that.
[02:40:22.940 --> 02:40:31.219]  But I learned a lot from Mercury, Nevada, and Area 51. But anyway, Chase, this is a Navy operation, and it's going down.
[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:36.139]  Well, tell me, as a son of someone who works at Area 51, what do you know about the UFOs?
[02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:40.579]  Have we made contact with extraterrestrial beings, or is it just military technology being developed?
[02:40:42.399 --> 02:40:44.979]  UFOs are 100% underground.
[02:40:45.299 --> 02:40:46.780]  They live in vast caverns.
[02:40:46.860 --> 02:40:48.600]  They found a cavern under Death Valley.
[02:40:48.780 --> 02:40:51.020]  A gold miner fell through a prospector.
[02:40:51.059 --> 02:40:52.239]  It was hushed up.
[02:40:52.360 --> 02:41:05.799]  He fell through and he fell into a vast cavernous He said there was light coming through the walls of the exterior of the walls of the canyon.
[02:41:05.940 --> 02:41:08.899]  He said he poked his head out and he could look out and see the canyon down below.
[02:41:09.100 --> 02:41:11.440]  He said it was a vast underground cavern.
[02:41:13.579 --> 02:41:19.840]  We're good to go.
[02:41:34.569 --> 02:41:35.569]  They told Tommy.
[02:41:35.690 --> 02:41:36.250]  They trusted him.
[02:41:36.329 --> 02:41:45.969]  They told Tommy, my son-in-law, they were out in Death Valley just below Mount Tukey on the funeral range.
[02:41:46.149 --> 02:41:48.969]  And this one old-timer, he touched this quartz vein.
[02:41:48.969 --> 02:41:54.809]  He said he thought he saw gold running through the quartz, this vein on the fissure.
[02:41:54.930 --> 02:41:57.809]  And he said he touched it, and his hand disappeared.
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:02.659]  And he screamed, and he jumped back, and his friend said, what's wrong?
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:05.120]  His friend didn't see it, and he said, come over here, come over here.
[02:42:05.420 --> 02:42:07.739]  He goes, put your hand out there, touch that vein.
[02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:08.860]  Look at that vein.
[02:42:08.959 --> 02:42:11.860]  He put his hand in there, and he said his arm went halfway in.
[02:42:12.559 --> 02:42:16.819]  And he said both of them screamed and yelled, and they never went back to that place.
[02:42:17.139 --> 02:42:17.840]  Wow, Michael.
[02:42:18.319 --> 02:42:19.920]  There's a portal, and there's an underground.
[02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:21.879]  I believe every UFO we see...
[02:42:23.820 --> 02:42:25.040]  Is from underground.
[02:42:25.079 --> 02:42:26.139]  Now listen to this real quick.
[02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:27.479]  I'll make it less than 30 seconds.
[02:42:27.959 --> 02:42:31.700]  We all worked in Beverly Hills most of our life before I moved out of California.
[02:42:31.979 --> 02:42:36.799]  And we're at the campground we had built in the back of our construction yard in Manhattan Beach, Lawndale there.
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:38.020]  And we're warming up.
[02:42:38.159 --> 02:42:40.520]  And this is in 2006, February.
[02:42:40.819 --> 02:42:41.040]  Winter.
[02:42:41.379 --> 02:42:42.860]  Five of us drinking Coors.
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:44.000]  And...
[02:42:45.039 --> 02:42:45.700]  Carpenters, you know.
[02:42:45.860 --> 02:42:48.319]  And we worked up in Beverly Hills building a custom home.
[02:42:48.399 --> 02:42:49.520]  So we're relaxing.
[02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:50.340]  My back to the fire.
[02:42:50.459 --> 02:42:53.299]  I look to the right because I see something moving extremely fast.
[02:42:53.620 --> 02:42:56.979]  It's directly over LAX. And I'm looking towards South Bay, the beach.
[02:42:57.180 --> 02:42:59.180]  I'm looking towards Hermosa, Manhattan Beach.
[02:42:59.559 --> 02:43:01.379]  And this thing is moving so fast.
[02:43:01.479 --> 02:43:02.200]  I go, look up, you guys.
[02:43:02.280 --> 02:43:02.799]  Look at this.
[02:43:03.500 --> 02:43:07.399]  And Shane Stanscheit and Corey Verzell look straight up.
[02:43:07.950 --> 02:43:10.469]  And I looked up, and it was motoring.
[02:43:10.590 --> 02:43:11.489]  I could not believe.
[02:43:11.729 --> 02:43:13.829]  It covered 22 miles.
[02:43:14.129 --> 02:43:15.350]  I've got this all figured out.
[02:43:15.590 --> 02:43:21.090]  22 miles in 6 seconds calculates out to 50,840 miles an hour.
[02:43:21.270 --> 02:43:23.729]  It didn't leave any noise, no contrails.
[02:43:23.850 --> 02:43:31.889]  It had two oval holes in the wings, and it had, I call it, an electrified magnetic plasma ionized.
[02:43:31.969 --> 02:43:42.579]  It was like a flowing plasma that flowed back from the leading edge We're good to go.
[02:43:53.329 --> 02:43:55.049]  Which I calculated 22 miles.
[02:43:55.309 --> 02:43:58.010]  It disappeared like somebody threw a switch on.
[02:43:59.610 --> 02:44:01.110]  Well, Mike, thank you so much for your call.
[02:44:01.209 --> 02:44:03.530]  Those stories are really intriguing, really fascinating.
[02:44:03.670 --> 02:44:04.610]  I'd appreciate you calling in.
[02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:05.510]  RC in Colorado.
[02:44:05.709 --> 02:44:06.549]  RC, what's on your mind?
[02:44:07.950 --> 02:44:08.850]  How you doing, Chase?
[02:44:09.190 --> 02:44:09.290]  Good.
[02:44:09.290 --> 02:44:11.389]  I love it when you're on air, man.
[02:44:11.569 --> 02:44:11.870]  Thank you.
[02:44:12.010 --> 02:44:13.510]  Great addition to InfoWars.
[02:44:14.270 --> 02:44:17.909]  The vitamin B foundational energy has changed my life, man.
[02:44:18.049 --> 02:44:19.229]  Everybody should check that out.
[02:44:19.879 --> 02:44:23.479]  And I gotta say, it's also a miraculous hangover cure.
[02:44:25.420 --> 02:44:26.780]  Well, that's good to hear, man.
[02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:27.579]  I appreciate that.
[02:44:28.739 --> 02:44:29.040]  Yeah.
[02:44:29.780 --> 02:44:40.139]  On the practical side of the drones, that video that Joe Rogan posted about them, those drones trying to sniff out them.
[02:44:53.290 --> 02:45:00.510]  What do you think about the AI supercomputers and the alleged proof of a multiverse?
[02:45:01.049 --> 02:45:07.510]  Well, it's so funny because after you discussed all that, you said the implications are wild.
[02:45:08.319 --> 02:45:10.819]  That's exactly what David Bohm called.
[02:45:11.219 --> 02:45:12.940]  He had a word for it.
[02:45:14.459 --> 02:45:28.420]  There's the implicate universe and the explicate universe, and the explicate universe is what we can measure, and the implicate universe is on the other side of the veil, and it's what the explicate universe precipitates out of.
[02:45:29.559 --> 02:45:41.819]  If you're into shamanism and that kind of thing, think about it as sacred geometry, the way the spirit precipitates The Spirit arranges itself, and then that is...
[02:45:41.819 --> 02:45:41.879]  Sure.
[02:45:41.879 --> 02:45:46.040]  Well, it explains how God may be omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent.
[02:45:47.069 --> 02:45:49.930]  Yeah, I mean, everything exists for all time, always.
[02:45:50.170 --> 02:45:51.350]  All realities.
[02:45:51.590 --> 02:45:52.629]  I mean, it has to.
[02:45:52.829 --> 02:45:58.870]  It just has to when you start piercing the veil and really thinking about it.
[02:45:58.989 --> 02:46:00.030]  And you know what's crazy?
[02:46:00.209 --> 02:46:05.069]  Is the Q Shaman understands all of this, and he's really able to explain it really well.
[02:46:05.190 --> 02:46:06.010]  I love that guy.
[02:46:06.129 --> 02:46:06.690]  Yeah, I love him too.
[02:46:06.709 --> 02:46:08.030]  He's genuinely very kind.
[02:46:08.989 --> 02:46:11.450]  Yeah, he really understands.
[02:46:13.170 --> 02:46:15.170]  You know, how all of that works.
[02:46:15.569 --> 02:46:17.430]  And I got a lot of respect for him.
[02:46:17.809 --> 02:46:18.049]  Absolutely.
[02:46:18.389 --> 02:46:19.850]  Well, R.C., thank you so much for your call.
[02:46:19.969 --> 02:46:20.450]  I appreciate it.
[02:46:20.549 --> 02:46:22.549]  Let's go to Rich in New Jersey.
[02:46:22.709 --> 02:46:24.370]  Rich, what do you think about these drones?
[02:46:24.489 --> 02:46:24.989]  Have you seen any?
[02:46:26.010 --> 02:46:26.229]  Yes.
[02:46:26.549 --> 02:46:27.389]  Can you hear me, Chase?
[02:46:27.590 --> 02:46:28.069]  You sound great.
[02:46:28.850 --> 02:46:29.129]  Yeah.
[02:46:29.649 --> 02:46:29.989]  All right.
[02:46:30.290 --> 02:46:33.989]  I'm in North Jersey, and I'll be quite honest here.
[02:46:34.049 --> 02:46:35.329]  I'm going to make two quick points.
[02:46:35.610 --> 02:46:35.969]  One...
[02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:47.899]  Everything we're talking about, all this military tech speak and all this stuff that I hear from the callers and everything I've seen on X and everything, this is only relevant.
[02:46:48.120 --> 02:46:56.040]  The only thing that's relevant is what is the deep state going to do to leverage this going forward in the next few months.
[02:46:56.159 --> 02:46:56.940]  That's all that matters.
[02:46:57.059 --> 02:46:59.959]  I could care less where it comes from, what it is.
[02:47:00.360 --> 02:47:01.479]  You know what I told my family?
[02:47:01.639 --> 02:47:07.219]  I said, listen, if these things ain't shooting lasers coming out of the sky, I'm right in the middle of it.
[02:47:07.260 --> 02:47:13.819]  I know a lot of people that have seen this phenomenon, seen the drones, and it's like, I have really no interest in this.
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:15.020]  I'm way beyond it.
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:15.920]  Way beyond it.
[02:47:15.979 --> 02:47:16.639]  I really don't.
[02:47:17.299 --> 02:47:28.319]  And number two, Just as a curiosity, to make the story even sexier, a friend of mine told me that he was in Central Jersey, which is about maybe 15 miles.
[02:47:28.479 --> 02:47:42.860]  You know, I'm like 10 miles east of New York City, and in Central Jersey, which is about 20 miles east, or about 30 miles southeast of New York City, they saw a type of helicopter helicopter.
[02:47:44.670 --> 02:47:48.110]  Black, kind of like an unmarked cop car, but a helicopter.
[02:47:49.010 --> 02:47:50.569]  Spray red mist.
[02:47:50.930 --> 02:47:53.969]  Yeah, I've heard about some chemtrails and some sprays happening from these.
[02:47:54.309 --> 02:47:54.889]  Oh, really?
[02:47:55.149 --> 02:47:55.709]  Oh, okay.
[02:47:55.930 --> 02:47:56.489]  Red mist.
[02:47:56.670 --> 02:47:57.190]  I was like, what?
[02:47:57.430 --> 02:47:58.450]  I was like, yeah, you know.
[02:47:58.950 --> 02:48:00.090]  Because he texted me.
[02:48:00.149 --> 02:48:01.030]  He goes, Rich, what do you think?
[02:48:01.149 --> 02:48:02.110]  I'm like, you know what?
[02:48:02.829 --> 02:48:11.079]  Listen, I don't think I can almost bet my life There's not going to be a chemical, biological, nuclear, dirty bomb attack and nothing.
[02:48:11.319 --> 02:48:19.860]  The biggest thing is that I've seen this during COVID. As soon as I heard the new normal after March of 2020, I said we are screwed.
[02:48:20.139 --> 02:48:26.120]  And the way the PSYOP has the most powerful effect on us more than anything else could.
[02:48:26.370 --> 02:48:29.149]  I don't think they're that stupid to detonate anything.
[02:48:29.329 --> 02:48:35.069]  I don't think they're going to do anything crazy because I think people are a lot wiser than we were back before 9-11.
[02:48:35.329 --> 02:48:39.030]  I would like to think so, but those are just my two cents, Chase.
[02:48:39.430 --> 02:48:41.010]  Well, thank you so much, Rich, for your call.
[02:48:41.090 --> 02:48:41.610]  I appreciate it.
[02:48:41.670 --> 02:48:44.750]  I think that's a lot of good perspective and insight there.
[02:48:44.889 --> 02:48:46.270]  Let's go to one more caller.
[02:48:46.409 --> 02:48:50.129]  We've got two minutes left before the great Gerald Salente takes over.
[02:48:50.629 --> 02:48:52.129]  Let's go to Tony in Florida.
[02:48:52.370 --> 02:48:53.170]  Tony, what's on your mind?
[02:48:54.579 --> 02:48:56.319]  Hey, thank you so much, Chase.
[02:48:56.680 --> 02:48:56.979]  Thank you.
[02:48:57.620 --> 02:49:04.600]  Hey, I just have a major contrary opinion to just using the term drone.
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:07.239]  I'm not saying there's not drones out there.
[02:49:07.360 --> 02:49:07.760]  There are.
[02:49:08.079 --> 02:49:19.280]  But the question no one's asking is, if there was a big UFO flap in the United States, how would the government try to debunk it?
[02:49:19.500 --> 02:49:30.450]  I've personally seen a form of visual debunking Carried out by a C-130 flying over Tiger Point and Gulf Breeze in the 90s.
[02:49:30.610 --> 02:49:36.709]  It was telling a rose-colored cable, a rose-colored flare on a cable that was feeling little.
[02:49:36.850 --> 02:49:44.469]  And this was a week after we saw a major UFO over Gulf Breeze.
[02:49:44.700 --> 02:49:46.940]  It was a rose-colored plasma light.
[02:49:47.139 --> 02:49:51.659]  It broke into two, four, six, you know, two, four, eight, just totally fractaled out.
[02:49:52.020 --> 02:49:52.959]  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[02:49:53.379 --> 02:49:57.659]  And then there was thousands of these little things offline, and then they reformed.
[02:49:57.920 --> 02:49:58.860]  Wow, it just split.
[02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:07.399]  Like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256. Yeah, like an intelligent plasma communicating with us somehow, Chase.
[02:50:08.600 --> 02:50:13.000]  That, I think, is what we're seeing a lot of when you see these big swarms.
[02:50:13.180 --> 02:50:16.719]  Hey, let's go flossing drones so people don't believe in lion eyes.
[02:50:16.979 --> 02:50:18.399]  I think that's going on.
[02:50:21.130 --> 02:50:23.489]  I'm a Marine, and we had some Marines.
[02:50:23.790 --> 02:50:28.090]  Second Anglico, Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company, was my last unit.
[02:50:28.469 --> 02:50:31.489]  Talked to airplanes and boats, told them what the bad guys are.
[02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:46.200]  Well, we had some guys doing a close air support exercise out in Yuma, Arizona, and An F4 came on station, and at the time, we didn't have an F4 on station, and the Major said, that thing just flew past us too slow.
[02:50:46.600 --> 02:50:46.959]  Wow.
[02:50:47.020 --> 02:50:47.920]  Hey, Tony, I'm sorry.
[02:50:48.020 --> 02:50:48.500]  I gotta let you go.
[02:50:48.620 --> 02:50:49.700]  We're coming up on the end of the hour.
[02:50:50.260 --> 02:50:52.659]  Stay tuned, folks, for the great Gerald Salente on the other side.
[02:50:53.100 --> 02:50:58.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting to stop World War III. We are battling to get Trump into office.
[02:50:58.739 --> 02:51:00.040]  He's only president-elect right now.
[02:51:00.200 --> 02:51:01.940]  We are exposing the globalists.
[02:51:02.040 --> 02:51:04.959]  We are reaching 60, 70, 80 million people a day.
[02:51:04.959 --> 02:51:06.819]  We're back in the Infowar studios.
[02:51:07.180 --> 02:51:09.200]  The purchase was fraudulent.
[02:51:09.569 --> 02:51:11.690]  There's emergency hearings in court coming up next week.
[02:51:11.809 --> 02:51:17.530]  But regardless, I'm going to stay on air at the Alex Jones Network even if this shuts down.
[02:51:17.729 --> 02:51:23.010]  So when you go to our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, that's not owned by me.
[02:51:23.229 --> 02:51:31.709]  The Onion people and the National Gun Control Crew and the Democrats, even if they succeed, which I don't believe they will, will not get thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:51:31.790 --> 02:51:35.069]  They will not get the Alex Jones Network because I don't own it.
[02:51:35.450 --> 02:51:40.649]  So when you support our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com with some of the most incredible supplements ever.

[02:51:58.090 --> 02:51:58.889]  I've lost so much weight.
[02:51:59.149 --> 02:51:59.850]  It's insane.
[02:51:59.969 --> 02:52:05.659]  Get that and other supplements and then There's over 200 designs of t-shirts, ball caps, and hoodies now there.
[02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:12.180]  These folks that own it bigly were already one of the top producers of Trump and Patriot gear.
[02:52:12.299 --> 02:52:13.120]  They had the best designs.
[02:52:13.520 --> 02:52:15.260]  All of the new Trump One gear.
[02:52:15.360 --> 02:52:17.739]  There's more than 40 shirts and hoodies and ball caps there.
[02:52:18.079 --> 02:52:19.379]  These designs are incredible.
[02:52:19.559 --> 02:52:25.819]  And now there's all these amazing Alex Jones shirts that are limited edition and will keep me on the air one way or another.
[02:52:25.959 --> 02:52:26.540]  Here they are.
[02:52:26.719 --> 02:52:27.500]  Look at this one.
[02:52:27.659 --> 02:52:31.559]  That famous meme of me coming out of the tunnel with all the Alex Jones clones.
[02:52:31.799 --> 02:52:33.579]  We are all Alex Jones.
[02:52:33.719 --> 02:52:34.760]  You've got to get that.
[02:52:35.360 --> 02:52:37.079]  Gay frogs equals extinction.
[02:52:37.379 --> 02:52:38.020]  Oh my goodness.
[02:52:38.440 --> 02:52:41.639]  What a way to wake folks up about all the poison in the water that's now mainstream news.
[02:52:42.180 --> 02:52:45.040]  1984 is not an instruction manual.
[02:52:45.500 --> 02:52:46.659]  Team Humanity.
[02:52:46.860 --> 02:52:48.319]  Oh my gosh, that is amazing.
[02:52:48.440 --> 02:52:50.659]  Launched that over a year ago with Elon Musk.
[02:52:50.840 --> 02:52:52.620]  And then, Dale Grebel.
[02:52:53.040 --> 02:52:58.200]  Oh, warns you about the government was right the whole time.
[02:52:58.639 --> 02:52:59.559]  Darkest Hour.
[02:52:59.819 --> 02:53:01.040]  Me is Winston Churchill.
[02:53:01.280 --> 02:53:06.139]  And so much more at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:53:06.219 --> 02:53:08.299]  Now, we don't make a ton off the t-shirts.
[02:53:08.850 --> 02:53:13.670]  We don't make a ton off the supplements because there's not a lot of markup in those, but we do sell a lot.
[02:53:13.809 --> 02:53:26.290]  But where we do get major funds is the marked up classic Alex Jones Infowars red on navy blue shirt and a few other fundraiser shirts that aren't 25 or 30 bucks, they're 50, so we get real money in.
[02:53:26.350 --> 02:53:30.069]  Because these t-shirts are high quality, printed right here in Arkansas in the United States.
[02:53:30.559 --> 02:53:34.020]  And so, extra, extra, extra large is like 16, 17 bucks.
[02:53:34.139 --> 02:53:36.440]  A small is like 15. The printing costs money.
[02:53:36.579 --> 02:53:37.860]  The sponsor gets part of the money.
[02:53:37.959 --> 02:53:39.200]  We get part of it to operate.
[02:53:39.860 --> 02:53:42.379]  We're making like six, seven bucks on the average t-shirt, which is great.
[02:53:42.540 --> 02:53:43.379]  And they spread the word.
[02:53:43.459 --> 02:53:44.139]  You meet like-minded people.
[02:53:44.239 --> 02:53:50.540]  But when you get the marked up shirts, only two of them are marked up to 50, we get some real money in to the operation.
[02:53:50.600 --> 02:53:53.780]  So if you really want to support, get the fundraiser shirts.
[02:53:54.180 --> 02:54:04.780]  Also, The posters, limited edition, back-to-back-to-back Trump win, all those are marked up where they cost us six, seven bucks to print them and to put it in the tube.
[02:54:04.940 --> 02:54:07.379]  So we make like 40-something bucks off that.
[02:54:07.479 --> 02:54:17.680]  If you really want to support us and hang it on the wall and know you supported the second American Revolution right at the critical point, then get some of the limited edition posters as well.
[02:54:17.819 --> 02:54:19.659]  But regardless, you're going to love the supplements.
[02:54:19.879 --> 02:54:21.100]  You're going to want to order again.
[02:54:21.340 --> 02:54:23.559]  We can't stay on air without your support.
[02:54:23.860 --> 02:54:24.979]  I'm suing the deep state.
[02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:25.920]  We're going after them.
[02:54:26.020 --> 02:54:32.059]  We have put all the stuff they did and the bid rigging and everything in these lawsuits and court filings.
[02:54:32.399 --> 02:54:33.520]  We're going to win this thing.
[02:54:33.639 --> 02:54:37.280]  But regardless, we've got to have money to continue to fight them and stay on air.
[02:54:37.399 --> 02:54:46.879]  So go now to thealexjonesstore.com for amazing products and know you stood with fellow Americans at the critical time to save our republic.
[02:54:48.219 --> 02:54:49.540]  Thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:54:49.639 --> 02:54:50.860]  Thank you so much for your support.
[02:54:53.190 --> 02:54:56.110]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:56.370 --> 02:54:56.450]  Woo!
[02:54:56.889 --> 02:54:57.729]  Miss being there.
[02:54:58.209 --> 02:55:11.729]  But I'm so happy to be back and I'm so grateful for everything InfoWars does and the great products that they have to help build your health in many different ways.
[02:55:11.729 --> 02:55:20.510]  From the information they have on there, you know, it builds the health of your brain and the great products they have.
[02:55:21.049 --> 02:55:22.690]  It builds the health of your body.
[02:55:22.889 --> 02:55:31.670]  And I say that with all sincerity because many years ago, back in the 1980s, this is the first book I worked on, Natural Healing.
[02:55:33.010 --> 02:55:35.149]  So I'm a firm believer of that.
[02:55:35.270 --> 02:55:44.049]  And when you go to the AlexJonesStore.com, you get these great products to help keep you going strong because you really need it today.
[02:55:44.229 --> 02:55:48.250]  Matter of fact, you know, the New Trends Journal, the issue is coming out tomorrow.
[02:55:48.809 --> 02:55:54.319]  And just one of the articles in it, To show you how bad things are going with people.
[02:55:55.299 --> 02:55:59.059]  It's in our trends live view.
[02:56:00.780 --> 02:56:05.100]  Study links processed foods with colon cancer.
[02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:07.379]  Processed foods.
[02:56:07.520 --> 02:56:08.700]  How about eating crap?
[02:56:11.639 --> 02:56:13.020]  Drink a coke?
[02:56:13.260 --> 02:56:15.819]  Lose 12 minutes of your life.
[02:56:16.299 --> 02:56:17.819]  Study suggests.
[02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:22.360]  Yeah, drink a Coke, snort a Coke, whatever you want to do, you eat a Coke, man.
[02:56:22.879 --> 02:56:30.219]  I mean, so you get these products and they really help build you, your immune system, and you really have to do it today.
[02:56:30.459 --> 02:56:32.920]  You know, people talk about climate change.
[02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:35.200]  All the poisons they're putting in.
[02:56:35.280 --> 02:56:37.299]  You like those microplastics everywhere?
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:43.059]  I like those artificial colors, those artificial flavors, yeah.
[02:56:43.799 --> 02:56:48.489]  So anyway, Support Infowars because they're doing everything they can to support you.
[02:56:48.809 --> 02:56:50.629]  You know, I called the campaign wrong.
[02:56:50.770 --> 02:56:52.690]  I thought Harris would win.
[02:56:52.790 --> 02:56:54.350]  And I only do it because of the data.
[02:56:54.989 --> 02:56:58.969]  And when I looked at the 2022 elections, abortion was a big issue.
[02:56:59.069 --> 02:56:59.989]  This time it wasn't.
[02:57:00.569 --> 02:57:08.170]  And the big issue, of course, is that we, the plantation workers of Slavelandia, are having a tough time, the working class.
[02:57:08.969 --> 02:57:10.850]  And that's why Trump won.
[02:57:12.229 --> 02:57:12.709]  And...
[02:57:13.780 --> 02:57:29.540]  This just came out on CNBC. Majority of Americans are ready to support Trump and large parts of his agenda, says CNBC survey.
[02:57:30.340 --> 02:57:33.920]  And I am among that majority.
[02:57:34.879 --> 02:57:43.540]  And let me tell you one of the big things I support with Donald Trump that a lot of my libertarian friends don't agree with me.
[02:57:44.409 --> 02:57:45.950]  I believe in tariffs.
[02:57:47.389 --> 02:57:47.950]  Yep.
[02:57:48.350 --> 02:57:49.809]  Want to see those tariffs coming?
[02:57:51.389 --> 02:58:03.250]  Because when you go back, once upon a time, before that slimeball made rot in hell that brought us World War I, Woodrow Wilson, the Federal Reserve, federal income tax.
[02:58:04.510 --> 02:58:06.729]  Oh, and the banks, the bandits.
[02:58:07.010 --> 02:58:17.709]  Yeah, the Federal Reserve, the banks, the bandits, federal income tax, World War I, and the IRS. The money the government used to get was from tariffs.
[02:58:20.430 --> 02:58:23.110]  And so I started doing research on the tariffs.
[02:58:23.889 --> 02:58:25.530]  There were those who were opposed to it.
[02:58:25.649 --> 02:58:27.309]  The Democrats were opposed to it.
[02:58:27.469 --> 02:58:28.709]  The Republicans were in favor of it.
[02:58:30.250 --> 02:58:32.670]  And McKinley, one of the presidents, says, what do you want?
[02:58:32.750 --> 02:58:33.309]  Cheap labor?
[02:58:34.629 --> 02:58:36.709]  Cheap prices or high wages?
[02:58:39.270 --> 02:58:40.129]  And that's it.
[02:58:40.549 --> 02:58:43.110]  We need to bring manufacturing back to America.
[02:58:43.819 --> 02:58:46.100]  And the only way it's going to happen is with tariffs.
[02:58:47.040 --> 02:58:49.500]  And we could become a self-sustaining economy.
[02:58:50.520 --> 02:58:57.520]  And we wrote about this years ago that that is the future of the countries that are going to prosper, not globalization.
[02:58:58.379 --> 02:59:00.600]  And we're going to take a break shortly.
[02:59:00.840 --> 02:59:03.260]  When I come back, I'm going to give you the proof of that.
[02:59:04.180 --> 02:59:12.879]  And nobody could deny the proof that I'm going to give you that we need to be self-sustaining because other countries are and they're profiting from it.
[02:59:14.049 --> 02:59:16.969]  We have to get high-paying jobs back to America.
[02:59:17.350 --> 02:59:21.430]  And if Trump stands by his word, the tariffs can make it happen.
[02:59:21.709 --> 02:59:22.829]  We're going to be right back.
[02:59:23.229 --> 02:59:23.790]  Stay tuned.
[02:59:23.989 --> 02:59:27.590]  Hey, great, great, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:27.870 --> 02:59:33.709]  And again, do everything you can to support Infowars because they're doing everything they can to support you.
[02:59:34.190 --> 02:59:42.590]  I'm going to get to another article, too, about the importance of Infowars and, of course, our magazine, The Trends Journal.
[02:59:43.260 --> 02:59:45.040]  Because journalism is dead.
[02:59:45.620 --> 02:59:49.379]  And we have an article in this week's coming up about it, too.
[02:59:49.659 --> 02:59:52.600]  I'm going to get back to tariffs and Trump.
[02:59:52.940 --> 02:59:54.420]  Death of journalism.
[02:59:55.379 --> 03:00:02.600]  Billionaires try to instill confidence as they bleed readership.
[03:00:04.879 --> 03:00:05.520]  Yep.
[03:00:07.239 --> 03:00:09.020]  So, the billionaires.
[03:00:10.040 --> 03:00:11.000]  Different trips.
[03:00:11.239 --> 03:00:13.149]  So, going back to Tariffs.
[03:00:13.950 --> 03:00:18.350]  This morning, I was having a nice little biscuit.
[03:00:19.870 --> 03:00:21.809]  And I put it on this little plate.
[03:00:25.729 --> 03:00:37.850]  One of my books of everything I've written, this is one of them, of course, it's an international bestseller, Trends 2000. And Trend Tracking, far better than Megatrends, Time Magazine.
[03:00:39.409 --> 03:00:39.930]  But...
[03:00:40.620 --> 03:00:43.620]  My favorite book is What Zidzi Gave Honey Boy.
[03:00:44.760 --> 03:00:47.520]  Zidzi is the Neapolitan dialect for auntie.
[03:00:47.940 --> 03:00:55.540]  And that TV show, Everyone Loves Raymond, the woman Doris Roberts, the last starring role was playing my aunt in this book.
[03:00:55.840 --> 03:00:57.979]  But Doris Roberts died 15 minutes into the movie.
[03:00:58.139 --> 03:00:58.760]  You get it on YouTube.
[03:00:58.819 --> 03:01:01.239]  And you get this book by going to trendsjournal.com.
[03:01:01.379 --> 03:01:02.979]  This is what America used to be.
[03:01:03.319 --> 03:01:05.059]  I'm going back to Trump and tariffs.
[03:01:06.780 --> 03:01:09.700]  Once upon a time, I'm up here in Kingston, New York.
[03:01:09.780 --> 03:01:10.440]  It was the Gantt.
[03:01:11.939 --> 03:01:12.760]  Shirt factory.
[03:01:12.879 --> 03:01:14.200]  There's shirt factories all over here.
[03:01:15.899 --> 03:01:17.799]  So this morning I'm having a biscuit.
[03:01:19.700 --> 03:01:21.299]  And I put it on this little plate.
[03:01:22.799 --> 03:01:24.879]  This was from my aunt Zizzi.
[03:01:24.979 --> 03:01:26.000]  May she rest in peace.
[03:01:28.219 --> 03:01:30.120]  Here's what the back of the plate says.
[03:01:31.719 --> 03:01:32.899]  This nice little plate.
[03:01:37.139 --> 03:01:38.870]  Syracuse China.
[03:01:39.110 --> 03:01:39.809]  No, no, no.
[03:01:40.309 --> 03:01:41.530]  That's Syracuse, New York.
[03:01:41.670 --> 03:01:42.950]  They used to call this stuff China.
[03:01:43.309 --> 03:01:44.389]  It's not that China.
[03:01:45.270 --> 03:01:46.409]  Syracuse, China.
[03:01:52.709 --> 03:01:55.889]  USA. That's right.
[03:01:57.270 --> 03:01:59.329]  When you had manufacturing jobs.
[03:02:00.610 --> 03:02:03.069]  Now you got crap jobs.
[03:02:03.710 --> 03:02:05.770]  Hey, get a job at Target.
[03:02:06.010 --> 03:02:07.489]  No, I think I'll work at Home Depot.
[03:02:07.670 --> 03:02:09.110]  I think Lowe's is better.
[03:02:09.530 --> 03:02:11.290]  Oh, Kohl's would be great for me.
[03:02:11.750 --> 03:02:13.149]  They pay you nothing.
[03:02:13.649 --> 03:02:16.889]  You're not talking about a plantation worker of Slavelandia.
[03:02:18.670 --> 03:02:26.010]  Thanks to the slime balls that did away with all the the antitrust laws that made this happen.
[03:02:26.709 --> 03:02:36.129]  And speaking of slime balls, Arrogant little boy, not a man, an arrogant little nothing.
[03:02:38.489 --> 03:02:43.209]  This is one of my t-shirts back in 1992 when he ran for office.
[03:02:43.809 --> 03:02:44.530]  See that?
[03:02:45.610 --> 03:02:47.889]  Beware, slick willy.
[03:02:48.409 --> 03:02:48.829]  Yep.
[03:02:49.809 --> 03:02:59.909]  This is a slime ball that gave us NAFTA. So these Syracuse, they move out of Syracuse and they go down to Mexico for cheap labor.
[03:03:02.989 --> 03:03:04.190]  All the manufacturers.
[03:03:05.290 --> 03:03:06.809]  Get that cheap labor.
[03:03:07.329 --> 03:03:08.389]  Hey, you get a job.
[03:03:08.530 --> 03:03:12.649]  You get a job at, you know, waiting on tables.
[03:03:12.909 --> 03:03:15.469]  You don't have to work in a factory and make money.
[03:03:16.690 --> 03:03:20.670]  This is the Bill Clinton that brought China into the World Trade Organization.
[03:03:21.329 --> 03:03:25.229]  Officially, two weeks after 9-11, when nobody was watching.
[03:03:27.450 --> 03:03:36.809]  And all the manufacturers that left Europe And the United States to get that cheap labor so they can make more money.
[03:03:37.010 --> 03:03:41.770]  We don't have to pay you anything, but we'll make more money and we'll get rich and bigger.
[03:03:42.329 --> 03:03:44.790]  I am against globalization.
[03:03:47.969 --> 03:03:49.309]  In more than one way.
[03:03:50.010 --> 03:03:52.770]  I launched Occupy Peace over a decade ago.
[03:03:53.979 --> 03:03:57.079]  Close those 900 military bases overseas.
[03:03:57.159 --> 03:03:58.459]  Don't need to be in Italy.
[03:03:58.639 --> 03:03:59.620]  Don't need to be in Germany.
[03:03:59.860 --> 03:04:00.899]  Don't need to be in Japan.
[03:04:01.100 --> 03:04:06.360]  Don't need to be anywhere but in the USA. Bring home those troops and secure the homeland with them.
[03:04:06.520 --> 03:04:07.040]  That's right.
[03:04:08.020 --> 03:04:11.040]  And put them to work to rebuild our third world infrastructure.
[03:04:11.600 --> 03:04:14.219]  Like a work progress administration for the Great Depression.
[03:04:14.719 --> 03:04:19.860]  So it's not only on that level, and don't call me an isolationist.
[03:04:20.040 --> 03:04:22.639]  I believe in the founding fathers like George Washington.
[03:04:23.250 --> 03:04:24.690]  Who also believed in tariffs.
[03:04:25.549 --> 03:04:30.670]  And so don't love a nation or hate a nation because if you do, you become a slave to them.
[03:04:31.110 --> 03:04:32.149]  His words, not mine.
[03:04:32.829 --> 03:04:36.909]  And this crap has been going on for thousands of years overseas.
[03:04:37.389 --> 03:04:38.909]  We're not going to fix it.
[03:04:40.110 --> 03:04:42.389]  We get involved, it'll only make it worse.
[03:04:43.110 --> 03:04:47.010]  So, going back to tariffs and being self-sustaining.
[03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:49.090]  Facts, I said.
[03:04:49.250 --> 03:04:49.469]  Fact.
[03:04:51.920 --> 03:04:54.840]  And I would say this to Biden, fact you.
[03:04:56.139 --> 03:05:10.079]  Because you're the clown boy that said those tariffs and sanctions that you're going to put on Russia when the war began on February 24th, 2022, the Ukraine war, we're going to punish Putin.
[03:05:10.879 --> 03:05:12.280]  You didn't punish Putin.
[03:05:16.600 --> 03:05:18.100]  Russia's economy went up.
[03:05:18.959 --> 03:05:20.899]  We said it would when it happened.
[03:05:21.819 --> 03:05:22.440]  You know why?
[03:05:22.760 --> 03:05:30.420]  We said that Russia has everything that they need to be self-sustaining and self-sufficient.
[03:05:32.100 --> 03:05:35.680]  They have the human and natural resources to do so.
[03:05:36.319 --> 03:05:38.479]  And that's what happened.
[03:05:38.760 --> 03:05:46.459]  All those companies that fled out of Russia, the Russian people took them over.
[03:05:47.670 --> 03:05:49.229]  We'll rename McDonald's.
[03:05:49.329 --> 03:05:50.469]  Get Starbucks out of here.
[03:05:50.889 --> 03:05:52.190]  It's crap coffee.
[03:05:52.370 --> 03:05:53.629]  Anyway, a drink and a Coke?
[03:05:55.469 --> 03:05:56.930]  I don't know.
[03:05:57.209 --> 03:05:58.930]  But anyway, all of that's gone.
[03:05:59.190 --> 03:06:02.069]  Russians became more self-sustaining, self-sufficient.
[03:06:02.469 --> 03:06:03.409]  Their economy went up.
[03:06:07.649 --> 03:06:12.690]  I have been forecasting this for well over a decade.
[03:06:13.049 --> 03:06:17.129]  That America needs to become self-sustaining and self-sufficient.
[03:06:17.729 --> 03:06:22.450]  We have the human and natural resources that we need to make that happen.
[03:06:23.829 --> 03:06:32.530]  I grew up, I'm the same age as Trump, 78. By the way, when I was a kid, I was the youngest of five, born right after the war in the Bronx.
[03:06:32.670 --> 03:06:33.670]  They couldn't control me.
[03:06:34.290 --> 03:06:38.350]  They used to say they had to tie me to the crib with nylon stockings because I'm out the window.
[03:06:39.250 --> 03:06:41.049]  Now that I have my parents arrested for doing that.
[03:06:41.149 --> 03:06:48.690]  But anyway, when I was a young guy, they see a little SOB, you're not going to make it till 21. So, I mean, I was out there.
[03:06:48.909 --> 03:06:49.770]  I'm a wild guy, you know.
[03:06:50.329 --> 03:06:51.530]  I'm the same age.
[03:06:51.930 --> 03:06:53.729]  I'm mentioning this, the Vietnam War.
[03:06:54.430 --> 03:06:55.450]  Prime draft meet.
[03:06:56.690 --> 03:06:58.930]  We gotta stop those commies.
[03:06:59.690 --> 03:07:04.989]  We gotta stop those commies because if we don't stop them in Vietnam, those dominoes will keep falling.
[03:07:05.469 --> 03:07:08.049]  Same BS line they're selling about Ukraine, by the way.
[03:07:08.370 --> 03:07:09.309]  We don't stop them.
[03:07:09.489 --> 03:07:15.049]  The Russians in Ukraine, before you know it, they're going to go take care of going to all of Europe.
[03:07:15.290 --> 03:07:15.690]  Anyway.
[03:07:16.639 --> 03:07:20.959]  Killed over 3 million by 3.5 million Vietnamese.
[03:07:21.420 --> 03:07:22.860]  Poisoned the place with Agent Orange.
[03:07:23.399 --> 03:07:24.680]  Gotta get those commies.
[03:07:25.120 --> 03:07:27.399]  They only killed 60,000 Americans.
[03:07:29.319 --> 03:07:31.979]  250,000, 300,000 seriously wounded.
[03:07:33.399 --> 03:07:36.639]  Destroyed the lives of another couple of hundred thousand.
[03:07:38.079 --> 03:07:41.819]  To stop those lousy commies from taking over Vietnam.
[03:07:42.639 --> 03:07:42.760]  Huh.
[03:07:43.340 --> 03:07:43.780]  Vietnam.
[03:07:48.320 --> 03:07:51.760]  They are our second biggest importer.
[03:07:51.920 --> 03:07:53.000]  We import more.
[03:07:53.799 --> 03:08:00.139]  Second largest importer of clothing and shoes come from Vietnam.
[03:08:00.399 --> 03:08:00.920]  That's right.
[03:08:01.700 --> 03:08:04.479]  The ones that they taught us to hate and fight against.
[03:08:05.079 --> 03:08:08.840]  Hey, but we're making a lot of money getting that cheap stuff over here.
[03:08:09.360 --> 03:08:14.200]  So I totally support tariffs.
[03:08:15.319 --> 03:08:21.969]  And To go back to why I support them, and these are the facts.
[03:08:25.850 --> 03:08:44.450]  We didn't have an income tax where these slimeball lowlife pieces of arrogant scum politicians steal our money in the name of taxes because they don't work in their lives.
[03:08:49.110 --> 03:08:51.549]  They just suck off the public, you know what?
[03:08:52.629 --> 03:08:55.750]  They want our money, tax money.
[03:08:56.010 --> 03:08:59.409]  When you had tariffs, you didn't have income tax.
[03:09:00.389 --> 03:09:06.829]  So I say, tariffs and no income tax.
[03:09:07.209 --> 03:09:08.909]  Oh, prices will go up?
[03:09:09.190 --> 03:09:09.430]  Great.
[03:09:10.090 --> 03:09:11.770]  They'll go up short term.
[03:09:12.430 --> 03:09:18.270]  But do away with our income tax if you're going to put tariffs on, like it used to be.
[03:09:20.649 --> 03:09:21.229]  I pay what?
[03:09:21.309 --> 03:09:24.010]  About 40% taxes, 30-something percent.
[03:09:25.149 --> 03:09:26.190]  For what?
[03:09:26.729 --> 03:09:27.790]  For what?
[03:09:28.610 --> 03:09:29.190]  What's up?
[03:09:29.370 --> 03:09:31.090]  I'm Chuckie Schumer!
[03:09:32.010 --> 03:09:33.870]  No, no, I'm Adam Schitt!
[03:09:34.190 --> 03:09:35.770]  No, no, no, no, no!
[03:09:35.850 --> 03:09:37.229]  I'm Lindsey Graham!
[03:09:38.030 --> 03:09:43.290]  I'm a little slob that'll tell you what to do, and you pay me to do it!
[03:09:45.309 --> 03:09:49.549]  Yeah, tariffs and no taxes, it's a fact.
[03:09:50.620 --> 03:09:55.659]  We did not have income taxes until they lifted the tariffs.
[03:09:58.139 --> 03:09:59.940]  I'm for tariffs.
[03:10:00.239 --> 03:10:01.659]  I'm against income tax.
[03:10:01.959 --> 03:10:04.120]  It's stealing our money.
[03:10:06.180 --> 03:10:09.420]  So, those are just some of the facts.
[03:10:10.879 --> 03:10:11.600]  Here.
[03:10:11.920 --> 03:10:12.819]  Google it up.
[03:10:13.100 --> 03:10:13.840]  Go to Wikipedia.
[03:10:14.639 --> 03:10:19.159]  History of tariffs in the United States.
[03:10:22.110 --> 03:10:26.790]  And they got this quote here by McKinley.
[03:10:28.610 --> 03:10:29.469]  William McKinley.
[03:10:30.229 --> 03:10:33.809]  By the way, Yogi Berra used to be, you know, I was a Yankee fan as a kid.
[03:10:34.069 --> 03:10:35.670]  We used to go to games all the time, you know.
[03:10:36.290 --> 03:10:38.790]  Bronx guy, you know, we moved to Yonkers, still go right down there.
[03:10:39.030 --> 03:10:42.010]  But anyway, Yogi Berra, you know, he was a catcher.
[03:10:42.329 --> 03:10:44.309]  And McKinley was an empire.
[03:10:45.010 --> 03:10:49.549]  And McKinley called a ball that should have been a strike or a strike that should have been a ball or whatever.
[03:10:50.209 --> 03:10:55.409]  And Yogi Berra said to McKinley, the Empire, they shot the wrong McKinley.
[03:10:55.770 --> 03:10:57.549]  They shot William McKinley.
[03:10:57.690 --> 03:10:59.110]  Some guy killed the president.
[03:10:59.309 --> 03:11:00.969]  But anyway, it's a Yogi Berra story.
[03:11:02.610 --> 03:11:17.430]  President William McKinley stated that the United States stands under the Republican Party as, quote, Under free trade, the trader is the master and the producer the slave.
[03:11:18.979 --> 03:11:32.219]  Protection is but the law of nature, the law of self-preservation, of self-development, of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man.
[03:11:33.299 --> 03:11:36.280]  It is said that protection is immoral.
[03:11:36.860 --> 03:11:37.120]  Why?
[03:11:37.739 --> 03:11:44.219]  If protection builds up and elevates 63 million, that was the population back then.
[03:11:44.700 --> 03:11:48.540]  Again, if it builds up and elevates the population.
[03:11:49.809 --> 03:11:55.870]  The influence of those 63 million of people elevates the rest of the world.
[03:11:56.469 --> 03:12:03.909]  We cannot take a step in the pathway of progress without benefiting mankind everywhere.
[03:12:04.110 --> 03:12:04.770]  Isn't that nice?
[03:12:06.030 --> 03:12:07.590]  Those words are forgotten.
[03:12:08.969 --> 03:12:16.409]  Free trade destroys the dignity and independence of American labor.
[03:12:17.690 --> 03:12:22.129]  It will take away from the people of this country who work for a living.
[03:12:22.450 --> 03:12:22.829]  Yep.
[03:12:23.610 --> 03:12:25.030]  Exactly what's happened.
[03:12:25.530 --> 03:12:27.010]  Exactly what's happened.
[03:12:28.370 --> 03:12:33.649]  And the majority of them live by the sweat of their faces.
[03:12:34.090 --> 03:12:38.690]  It will take from them heart and home and hope.
[03:12:39.750 --> 03:12:42.590]  It will be self-destruction.
[03:12:46.549 --> 03:12:55.370]  He also categorically rejected the cheaper is better argument because that's the line that they're selling now.
[03:12:56.010 --> 03:12:57.090]  Cheaper is better.
[03:12:57.489 --> 03:12:58.850]  You want to pay more?
[03:12:59.290 --> 03:12:59.930]  You want to pay more?
[03:13:00.069 --> 03:13:00.690]  Cheap is better.
[03:13:01.170 --> 03:13:02.250]  Yeah, you got a cheap job.
[03:13:02.389 --> 03:13:03.430]  You could buy cheap stuff.
[03:13:06.569 --> 03:13:15.290]  He goes on to say, they, free traders, say, quote, buy where you can, buy the cheapest.
[03:13:16.750 --> 03:13:18.430]  That is one of their maxims.
[03:13:18.489 --> 03:13:22.930]  Of course, that applies to labor, as do everything else.
[03:13:23.790 --> 03:13:29.170]  Let me give you a maxim that is a thousand times better than that.
[03:13:30.190 --> 03:13:32.549]  And it is the protection maxim.
[03:13:33.750 --> 03:13:45.250]  Quote, buy where you can pay the easiest, and that spot on earth is where labor wins its highest rewards.
[03:13:45.950 --> 03:13:46.329]  Yeah.
[03:13:47.290 --> 03:13:49.750]  Where we win our highest rewards.
[03:13:52.049 --> 03:13:58.870]  They say if you had not the protective tariff things, it would be a little cheaper.
[03:13:59.389 --> 03:14:09.790]  Well, whether a thing is cheap or whether it is dear depends on what we can earn by our daily labor.
[03:14:10.870 --> 03:14:16.540]  Free trade cheapens the product By cheapening the producer.
[03:14:18.319 --> 03:14:26.459]  Protection cheapens the product by elevating the producer.
[03:14:29.399 --> 03:14:45.389]  He goes on to say the protective tariff policy of the Republicans has made the lives of the masses of our countrymen sweeter and brighter and has entered the homes of America Carrying comfort and cheer and courage.
[03:14:47.489 --> 03:14:56.209]  It gives a premium on human energy and awakens the noblest aspiration in the breasts of men.
[03:14:57.069 --> 03:15:10.790]  Our own experience shows that it is the best for our citizenship and our civilization and that it opens up a higher and better destiny for our people.
[03:15:11.129 --> 03:15:12.250]  So there you got it.
[03:15:14.540 --> 03:15:16.280]  Totally, totally support it.
[03:15:16.879 --> 03:15:25.860]  But again, yes, the cost of products will go up, but what we earn will go up.
[03:15:26.239 --> 03:15:30.120]  And again, I want to go back to McKinley Times.
[03:15:32.760 --> 03:15:35.100]  Tariffs and no income tax.
[03:15:36.200 --> 03:15:41.700]  Again, that slimeball made rotten hell Woodrow Wilson gave us the Federal Reserve.
[03:15:44.069 --> 03:15:45.530]  Internal Revenue Service.
[03:15:47.969 --> 03:15:49.149]  Federal taxes.
[03:15:50.309 --> 03:15:52.250]  And World War One.
[03:15:53.389 --> 03:15:55.909]  A war we never should have got involved in.
[03:15:56.129 --> 03:15:57.309]  Just like World War Two.
[03:15:58.250 --> 03:15:59.950]  And just like the other wars.
[03:16:01.750 --> 03:16:03.729]  So I totally support it.
[03:16:04.829 --> 03:16:06.350]  And we really need it.
[03:16:06.530 --> 03:16:09.010]  So on to where the economy is going under Trump.
[03:16:09.750 --> 03:16:10.989]  Here's my forecast.
[03:16:12.889 --> 03:16:18.750]  I think it's going to be a very good year, particularly for the equity markets.
[03:16:20.569 --> 03:16:28.590]  Most of the banksters are projecting like, you know, the S&P going up, you know, six, seven percent, which is good, you know, fine.
[03:16:29.889 --> 03:16:31.629]  But here's what I see happening.
[03:16:32.530 --> 03:16:34.350]  And again, I only go by the facts.
[03:16:39.870 --> 03:16:42.110]  Right now you're seeing Canada.
[03:16:42.860 --> 03:16:47.780]  Just lowered their, the Bank of Canada just lowered their interest rates 50 basis points last week.
[03:16:48.020 --> 03:16:48.860]  50 basis points.
[03:16:50.659 --> 03:16:54.479]  ECB this last week lowered theirs 25 basis points.
[03:16:54.979 --> 03:17:01.819]  So the value of the loonie and the euro going down because of their lower interest rates.
[03:17:02.379 --> 03:17:05.639]  As George Collins says, one big club and you ain't in it.
[03:17:06.299 --> 03:17:07.979]  So we're all in the same club.
[03:17:08.969 --> 03:17:11.889]  So America's gonna have to keep lowering their interest rates.
[03:17:12.049 --> 03:17:17.389]  Because if the dollar gets too strong, it's gonna destroy all these other currencies.
[03:17:18.549 --> 03:17:20.229]  And they don't want to see that happen.
[03:17:21.770 --> 03:17:31.930]  Number two, as I said, going by when he was in office, Trump is gonna do everything he can to keep boosting the economy.
[03:17:32.629 --> 03:17:43.040]  And the only way the economy is gonna keep boosting is Lower interest rates.
[03:17:46.159 --> 03:17:48.020]  Mortgage rates have to come down.
[03:17:48.420 --> 03:17:53.180]  You got home buying now is that, you know, terrible times, like going back to the 1990s.
[03:17:55.239 --> 03:17:58.139]  The mortgage rates are still too high.
[03:17:59.659 --> 03:18:09.040]  Before the COVID war in 2020, new home sales went to 40% of new home buyers.
[03:18:09.360 --> 03:18:09.899]  That's right.
[03:18:11.149 --> 03:18:17.629]  40% of the people buying new homes, buying homes, went to first-time buyers.
[03:18:17.870 --> 03:18:21.790]  Now that number's down to 27% because they can't afford to buy a house.
[03:18:23.010 --> 03:18:28.549]  So he's going to do what he can to jack up the economy.
[03:18:29.809 --> 03:18:32.489]  And that means to me lower interest rates.
[03:18:32.690 --> 03:18:37.770]  Now, the lower interest rates go, the higher gold prices will go.
[03:18:38.569 --> 03:18:43.049]  Since Trump came in, man, the gold boom, it peaked.
[03:18:43.750 --> 03:18:46.969]  Gold hit, what, 2,800 bucks an ounce.
[03:18:47.229 --> 03:18:51.469]  Now it's down to, what, 2,650-something dollars an ounce.
[03:18:53.030 --> 03:19:02.069]  Which is still up, by the way, one of our top trends for 2024 that came on on January 2nd of this year was a golden year for gold.
[03:19:02.209 --> 03:19:05.770]  Gold prices were up over $600 an ounce this year.
[03:19:06.500 --> 03:19:08.540]  But when Trump came in, the game changed.
[03:19:09.739 --> 03:19:11.299]  And what did the game change to?
[03:19:12.399 --> 03:19:12.879]  Bitcoin.
[03:19:14.159 --> 03:19:17.780]  Again, people sometimes call me a futurist.
[03:19:17.920 --> 03:19:19.340]  Nobody can predict the future.
[03:19:19.500 --> 03:19:20.440]  There are too many wild cards.
[03:19:21.299 --> 03:19:25.399]  And now the crypto card's just been played, and it's a wild card.
[03:19:26.780 --> 03:19:30.700]  Remember, Trump was not pro-Bitcoin at one time.
[03:19:30.940 --> 03:19:32.899]  He didn't say some nice things about it.
[03:19:33.239 --> 03:19:33.979]  The game changed.
[03:19:35.120 --> 03:19:41.420]  And now you're looking at the price of Bitcoin's gone up, what, well over 40% since he's gotten to office.
[03:19:42.000 --> 03:19:43.799]  Since he won the election, excuse me.
[03:19:46.239 --> 03:19:54.319]  So we see a very, very, very positive year for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
[03:19:58.180 --> 03:20:04.889]  And while gold will go up, It won't have the boom that it had before.
[03:20:06.209 --> 03:20:13.750]  And the reason why it won't have the boom that it had before is because more and more money is going to go into cryptos.
[03:20:14.510 --> 03:20:16.110]  It is the future.
[03:20:16.590 --> 03:20:17.909]  Like it or not.
[03:20:18.569 --> 03:20:20.110]  How long it will last?
[03:20:21.389 --> 03:20:31.549]  Because the other side of the equation is you're going to start seeing more and more banks go central bank digital currencies, CBDCs.
[03:20:32.549 --> 03:20:38.290]  And it may be one of the ways also to handle the debt problem that can't handle it.
[03:20:39.489 --> 03:20:42.170]  We did away with that dirty dollar.
[03:20:42.450 --> 03:20:43.649]  No more dirty dollars.
[03:20:43.649 --> 03:20:46.030]  We're going to digital cash.
[03:20:48.989 --> 03:20:51.450]  We're from dirty cash to digital trash.
[03:20:51.729 --> 03:20:52.989]  Because digital is backed by nothing.
[03:20:53.270 --> 03:20:54.090]  It's an invented thing.
[03:20:55.030 --> 03:20:57.049]  So we're still bullish on gold.
[03:20:57.969 --> 03:21:00.610]  Very bullish on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
[03:21:01.889 --> 03:21:08.909]  And again, the people Trump has brought into the administration, as you well know, a lot of them are crypto fans.
[03:21:09.989 --> 03:21:12.649]  So we see that is where it's going.
[03:21:13.110 --> 03:21:18.709]  We see the economy doing good and economy is doing good now.
[03:21:19.350 --> 03:21:21.350]  But again, not for the average person.
[03:21:22.729 --> 03:21:27.110]  And that's why the tariffs will change that once we get manufacturing back.
[03:21:27.370 --> 03:21:29.049]  But it's not going to happen overnight.
[03:21:29.530 --> 03:21:31.270]  There's ups and downs in life.
[03:21:31.969 --> 03:21:34.649]  And there'll be an up and down on the tariff thing as well.
[03:21:35.610 --> 03:21:38.149]  But I see it as a positive, not a negative.
[03:21:38.610 --> 03:21:41.170]  Because America needs to be self-sustaining.
[03:21:41.469 --> 03:21:47.469]  I'm not a fan of globalization, just like I'm not a fan of the United States getting involved in other people's wars.
[03:21:47.809 --> 03:21:48.870]  I'm an American.
[03:21:49.370 --> 03:21:51.670]  America first and America only.
[03:21:52.110 --> 03:21:53.709]  So we're going to take a break now.
[03:21:54.209 --> 03:21:57.170]  Remember, support Infowars because they're supporting you.
[03:21:57.489 --> 03:21:58.510]  We'll be right back.
[03:21:58.610 --> 03:22:00.829]  I have a lot more to tell you about the Trentons.
[03:22:01.309 --> 03:22:03.590]  We've been through a lot at Infowars.
[03:22:03.770 --> 03:22:06.309]  America and the world has been through hell.
[03:22:06.489 --> 03:22:07.790]  But the Great Awakening is here.
[03:22:07.989 --> 03:22:09.829]  The globalists are in full panic mode.
[03:22:09.989 --> 03:22:22.530]  And now it's more important than ever to keep the most powerful, effective voices at exposing the globalist agenda and promoting the Team Humanity agenda on air.
[03:22:23.129 --> 03:22:31.530]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, is owned by great patriots and some of the top makers of Patriot apparel.
[03:22:31.770 --> 03:22:42.850]  So whatever happens to Infowars in the future, they are going to back us to stay on air at the Alex Jones Network, at AJ and Live on X and at alexjones.network.
[03:22:42.969 --> 03:22:49.850]  So when you go to thealexjonesstore.com and get any of the great apparel, any of the amazing supplements, you're keeping us on air.
[03:22:50.049 --> 03:22:54.110]  Now, the t-shirts are affordable, the supplements are very competitively priced, and they're great.
[03:22:54.110 --> 03:22:59.309]  But we've got some items on the store for folks that really want to support and have mementos of your support.
[03:22:59.370 --> 03:23:02.129]  We have two new campaign coins.
[03:23:02.250 --> 03:23:03.969]  Two different coins right here.
[03:23:04.190 --> 03:23:09.270]  One is the answer to 1984 is 1776.com.
[03:23:09.670 --> 03:23:12.850]  And on one side, it's got the Gadsden flag.
[03:23:13.030 --> 03:23:15.950]  On the other side, it's got yours truly.
[03:23:16.290 --> 03:23:28.430]  The other great coin is 1776 limited edition coin with a Gadsden flag, don't tread on me, and 1776. Both are powerful coins, powerful coins.
[03:23:28.819 --> 03:23:29.280]  Messages.
[03:23:29.579 --> 03:23:30.520]  They weigh a lot.
[03:23:30.620 --> 03:23:31.200]  They feel good.
[03:23:31.319 --> 03:23:32.000]  They're a great gift.
[03:23:32.180 --> 03:23:33.879]  They're a great memento.
[03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:35.120]  They're a great keepsake.
[03:23:35.239 --> 03:23:37.159]  They're a great conversation starter.
[03:23:37.459 --> 03:23:44.280]  And both these coins are $14.97 at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:23:44.379 --> 03:23:45.799]  We can't do this without you.
[03:23:45.959 --> 03:23:48.440]  We want to sell you products you love so you come back again and again.
[03:23:48.659 --> 03:23:49.979]  Thanks for keeping us in the fight.
[03:23:50.180 --> 03:23:54.000]  Please visit thealexjonesstore.com today and get the campaign coins.
[03:24:01.159 --> 03:24:03.879]  Hey, great being on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:04.200 --> 03:24:05.000]  I miss being on.
[03:24:05.100 --> 03:24:06.020]  Very happy to be back.
[03:24:06.780 --> 03:24:10.659]  You know, with Alex Jones, they're talking about the products that they're selling.
[03:24:11.020 --> 03:24:13.200]  People ask me, what can I do?
[03:24:13.260 --> 03:24:13.840]  What should I do?
[03:24:14.059 --> 03:24:16.040]  I say, you've got to get in the best shape you can.
[03:24:16.879 --> 03:24:18.959]  Physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[03:24:20.379 --> 03:24:23.059]  And these products, think about it.
[03:24:23.399 --> 03:24:26.620]  Think about what you're getting at the Alex Jones store.
[03:24:27.649 --> 03:24:28.709]  Vitamins and supplements.
[03:24:28.950 --> 03:24:31.250]  And again, it's not BS coming from me.
[03:24:31.790 --> 03:24:35.989]  Again, this is the 1980s when nobody was talking about this stuff, natural healing.
[03:24:36.209 --> 03:24:37.409]  First book I worked on.
[03:24:37.549 --> 03:24:46.110]  I also have a honorary doctorate from the National University of Health Sciences for the work I've done in complementary and integrated medicine.
[03:24:46.370 --> 03:24:54.030]  So it's not BS. But I'm mentioning this because all things are connected.
[03:24:55.659 --> 03:24:57.540]  Go to the Cartoon News Network.
[03:24:58.620 --> 03:25:00.959]  Go to any of the major media.
[03:25:02.620 --> 03:25:04.120]  Listen to the ads.
[03:25:05.340 --> 03:25:06.719]  You're not feeling good?
[03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:08.239]  Take this pill.
[03:25:10.379 --> 03:25:15.659]  You're eating a lot of crap?
[03:25:16.120 --> 03:25:17.440]  Keep eating the crap.
[03:25:17.620 --> 03:25:18.579]  Just take this pill.
[03:25:18.719 --> 03:25:21.520]  You'll get rid of the blimpitis that you got.
[03:25:23.639 --> 03:25:25.420]  One drug ad after another.
[03:25:25.940 --> 03:25:27.620]  One drug ad again.
[03:25:28.459 --> 03:25:29.780]  You know he could thank for that?
[03:25:34.379 --> 03:25:35.340]  Slick Willie.
[03:25:36.180 --> 03:25:37.040]  That's right.
[03:25:40.500 --> 03:25:48.680]  Drug ads were not on TV until that slime ball let him come on in 1997. That's it.
[03:25:50.840 --> 03:25:55.540]  There's no allotropic drug that cures a chronic degenerative disease.
[03:25:56.479 --> 03:25:57.120]  None.
[03:25:57.840 --> 03:25:58.479]  Zero.
[03:25:59.000 --> 03:25:59.420]  None.
[03:26:01.319 --> 03:26:12.299]  So the vitamins and supplements that you're getting at the alexjonesstore.com is what you really need.
[03:26:12.399 --> 03:26:14.280]  And you need it now more than ever.
[03:26:15.040 --> 03:26:19.159]  Because they're killing us in a thousand different ways.
[03:26:20.389 --> 03:26:22.549]  Again, you like the microplastics?
[03:26:23.149 --> 03:26:27.569]  We still got the PSBCs or PBSs, whatever they are, in the Hudson River.
[03:26:28.049 --> 03:26:29.670]  I mean, crap everywhere.
[03:26:31.110 --> 03:26:36.329]  So get these products because it's very important to be in the best shape you can.
[03:26:37.290 --> 03:26:40.590]  And the better shape you're in, the better you do.
[03:26:41.530 --> 03:26:47.489]  So now I'm going to go back to what in the world is going on, what's next, and what to look for.
[03:26:47.930 --> 03:26:57.329]  And again, on the economic front, There are always the wild cards that nobody could predict.
[03:26:58.290 --> 03:27:07.209]  And the big one that only we at the Trends Journal are talking about is the office building bust.
[03:27:09.110 --> 03:27:13.610]  And the office building bust is going to make the banks go bust.
[03:27:15.030 --> 03:27:19.909]  No one is talking about this in the mainstream media.
[03:27:20.989 --> 03:27:26.860]  So, Tracking trends is the understanding of where we are, how we got here to see where we're going.
[03:27:28.079 --> 03:27:30.379]  Oh, we're going into January, right?
[03:27:30.739 --> 03:27:32.540]  A couple of weeks away.
[03:27:33.280 --> 03:27:38.079]  What happened five years ago on January 2020?
[03:27:38.719 --> 03:27:41.659]  On Chinese Lunar New Year, the year of the rat?
[03:27:42.319 --> 03:27:44.079]  They launched a COVID war.
[03:27:45.120 --> 03:27:46.979]  Everybody called it a COVID war.
[03:27:47.420 --> 03:27:48.719]  All the politicians.
[03:27:49.190 --> 03:27:49.909]  We're going to war.
[03:27:50.010 --> 03:27:50.629]  We're going to war.
[03:27:51.350 --> 03:27:53.690]  They say to go to war, the masses follow.
[03:27:57.170 --> 03:27:58.250]  You're back in your house.
[03:27:58.350 --> 03:27:59.309]  You can't go to work.
[03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:02.129]  People went back in the house.
[03:28:02.229 --> 03:28:02.989]  They're not going to work.
[03:28:05.030 --> 03:28:12.350]  Month after month, year after year, and they say, I'm getting up at five o'clock in the morning to go commute an hour and a half each way, spending all this money.
[03:28:12.530 --> 03:28:13.750]  I got to be out of my mind.
[03:28:14.409 --> 03:28:15.350]  I'm not doing it anymore.
[03:28:16.549 --> 03:28:17.030]  That's right.
[03:28:18.010 --> 03:28:25.129]  Now, let's say that you're a person that owns 10 floors, rents 10 floors in a building and you had all these people in there.
[03:28:26.729 --> 03:28:27.969]  I never see them anyway.
[03:28:28.110 --> 03:28:29.090]  They're sitting in cubicles.
[03:28:29.370 --> 03:28:30.030]  Yeah, stay home.
[03:28:30.250 --> 03:28:31.290]  I don't need all this space.
[03:28:34.409 --> 03:28:43.069]  Depending on whose data you look at, the office vacancy rate before the COVID war was like about 9%.
[03:28:43.069 --> 03:28:46.469]  Now at the lowest number, it's 14%.
[03:28:46.469 --> 03:28:47.010]  Vacant.
[03:28:47.110 --> 03:28:47.610]  Nobody in there.
[03:28:49.739 --> 03:28:50.360]  Nobody in there.
[03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:52.639]  And then as high as 20%.
[03:28:52.639 --> 03:28:55.319]  So depending on whose data you're looking at.
[03:28:56.959 --> 03:29:01.659]  You have some $2 trillion worth of commercial real estate loans coming due.
[03:29:01.879 --> 03:29:03.739]  Again, we're going back to five years now.
[03:29:04.319 --> 03:29:11.959]  So when these leases are long-term leases, like five and ten year leases, so now the leases are coming up.
[03:29:14.180 --> 03:29:16.000]  And they're not going to renew them.
[03:29:19.469 --> 03:29:22.090]  Down in New York City a couple of weeks ago.
[03:29:24.489 --> 03:29:29.829]  I had the major Russian, not RT, the big, big one, wanted to do an interview with me.
[03:29:30.729 --> 03:29:33.569]  And it was down, they wanted me to do it down at the Stock Exchange.
[03:29:35.750 --> 03:29:36.170]  Outside.
[03:29:36.530 --> 03:29:36.649]  See?
[03:29:36.770 --> 03:29:37.190]  We did it.
[03:29:38.950 --> 03:29:42.569]  And I have a buddy that has a great restaurant.
[03:29:42.750 --> 03:29:44.110]  It's called Tudor City.
[03:29:45.790 --> 03:29:46.709]  Beautiful place.
[03:29:46.969 --> 03:29:48.690]  Right in Tudor City, in this city.
[03:29:49.340 --> 03:29:50.840]  Up on 40th and 2nd.
[03:29:51.700 --> 03:29:58.840]  We walked from down to Wall Street all the way up to 40th and 2nd.
[03:30:00.959 --> 03:30:03.260]  Every block, everywhere you look.
[03:30:03.879 --> 03:30:07.420]  For rent, for rent, for rent, for rent, for rent.
[03:30:08.639 --> 03:30:14.799]  Then we walked from 40th and 2nd over to 48th and Park Avenue.
[03:30:15.459 --> 03:30:16.360]  Whole street.
[03:30:16.700 --> 03:30:17.659]  This is Midtown.
[03:30:18.079 --> 03:30:20.229]  This is Midtown.
[03:30:20.549 --> 03:30:21.469]  A whole street.
[03:30:22.049 --> 03:30:23.350]  Empty retail.
[03:30:23.969 --> 03:30:25.829]  That's the retail that's empty.
[03:30:26.069 --> 03:30:28.610]  Because of all the people that stopped coming to work.
[03:30:30.750 --> 03:30:32.510]  It was dependent on commuters.
[03:30:33.190 --> 03:30:34.850]  No one's talking about this.
[03:30:35.530 --> 03:30:37.370]  Your office occupancy rate.
[03:30:38.950 --> 03:30:42.350]  Meaning people going back to the office.
[03:30:42.649 --> 03:30:49.309]  It's around 50% according to Castle Systems with a K. That's right.
[03:30:51.520 --> 03:30:58.120]  There's going to be an office building bust that's going to bring down the banks like we've never seen before.
[03:30:59.120 --> 03:31:04.559]  And this may be the year it happens because now the commercial real estate loans are coming due.
[03:31:05.340 --> 03:31:13.559]  Again, depending on whose numbers, between $2 trillion to $4 trillion over the next two years.
[03:31:15.639 --> 03:31:16.920]  Ain't going to pay him.
[03:31:18.159 --> 03:31:19.440]  Ain't going to pay him.
[03:31:21.729 --> 03:31:23.829]  So, we don't give financial advice.
[03:31:24.030 --> 03:31:29.170]  And in your Trends Journal, which costs a grand total of $2.56 a week, which is nothing.
[03:31:31.030 --> 03:31:35.729]  The Charlotte paper record, the New York Slime, costs $4 a day.
[03:31:35.889 --> 03:31:37.829]  You get hardly anything from it other than propaganda.
[03:31:39.090 --> 03:31:44.350]  Wall, SHI, you know what, with another letter journal, $5 a day.
[03:31:44.530 --> 03:31:45.350]  It's turned to crap.
[03:31:45.629 --> 03:31:47.389]  There's hardly any reporting on it at all anymore.
[03:31:47.670 --> 03:31:49.430]  They keep firing people.
[03:31:51.459 --> 03:32:02.719]  We're giving you, when no one else is giving you, when we're talking about this, the implications of this office building bust.
[03:32:04.719 --> 03:32:11.260]  It goes back to tracking trends, how we got here, where we are, how we got here.
[03:32:12.379 --> 03:32:18.920]  It's not only that, it's brought down the global economy.
[03:32:20.440 --> 03:32:23.940]  Let's look at the top 10 countries in the world.
[03:32:25.200 --> 03:32:27.200]  The United States is doing better than anybody.
[03:32:28.500 --> 03:32:29.139]  China?
[03:32:30.000 --> 03:32:32.020]  Again, each week we report on it.
[03:32:33.100 --> 03:32:35.059]  What their lousy numbers are doing.
[03:32:36.379 --> 03:32:38.639]  Imports down, exports down.
[03:32:39.659 --> 03:32:49.559]  Well, they got between, again, depending on whose numbers, between 60 to 90 million empty, empty, empty apartment buildings, office, rooms.
[03:32:50.360 --> 03:32:51.000]  Apartments.
[03:32:51.680 --> 03:32:52.239]  Yeah.
[03:32:52.840 --> 03:32:54.239]  60 to 90 million.
[03:32:54.819 --> 03:32:56.280]  They overbuilt it.
[03:32:58.860 --> 03:33:00.879]  With every boom, there's a bust.
[03:33:01.260 --> 03:33:07.139]  And when they got into the World Trade Organization, two weeks after 9-11, we're always watching.
[03:33:07.479 --> 03:33:08.920]  Thanks again to Bill Clinton.
[03:33:09.819 --> 03:33:11.159]  They overbuilt it.
[03:33:11.239 --> 03:33:11.940]  They had a big boom.
[03:33:12.760 --> 03:33:18.319]  And then their three years of zero COVID policy made a very bad situation much worse.
[03:33:23.130 --> 03:33:24.829]  So, then we go to Europe.
[03:33:25.190 --> 03:33:28.329]  Again, I just mentioned the ECB lowered their interest rates.
[03:33:30.510 --> 03:33:33.690]  Germany, the third largest economy in the world is in recession.
[03:33:35.430 --> 03:33:40.610]  And the projections for next year is that they may have 0.1% growth, which is nothing.
[03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:41.649]  It's still a recession.
[03:33:42.329 --> 03:33:44.309]  This is the third largest economy.
[03:33:44.489 --> 03:33:46.729]  We just said the second largest economy, third largest economy.
[03:33:47.030 --> 03:33:49.110]  Oh, now India, the fifth largest economy.
[03:33:50.090 --> 03:33:51.090]  They're not doing good either.
[03:33:51.250 --> 03:33:51.930]  They're going downtown.
[03:33:52.729 --> 03:33:54.270]  They were going really strong.
[03:33:56.510 --> 03:34:10.370]  The fake buildup from the COVID war, when they pumped all of this cheap money in, backed by nothing and printed on nothing, and zero in negative interest rates, those days are over.
[03:34:10.969 --> 03:34:12.770]  And now we're paying the price for it.
[03:34:12.930 --> 03:34:15.690]  So, again, we don't give financial advice.
[03:34:16.829 --> 03:34:18.610]  We're still bullish on gold.
[03:34:19.579 --> 03:34:21.379]  And we're bullish on Bitcoin.
[03:34:22.299 --> 03:34:23.879]  Again, Bitcoin ate up.
[03:34:24.799 --> 03:34:27.680]  $107,000 for one coin.
[03:34:28.159 --> 03:34:37.000]  Oh, and my dear friend Max Keiser, matter of fact, I was on with Max on Infowars at the beginning of this year.
[03:34:37.600 --> 03:34:40.100]  And Max was going off the charts.
[03:34:40.739 --> 03:34:42.139]  Off the charts.
[03:34:45.000 --> 03:34:46.020]  On Bitcoin.
[03:34:46.799 --> 03:34:48.559]  I was on the gold side.
[03:34:51.619 --> 03:34:53.959]  Again, the wild card was played, the Trump card.
[03:34:55.540 --> 03:35:02.020]  And now Max Keiser is probably worth, you know, a couple of hundred billion dollars.
[03:35:02.540 --> 03:35:11.459]  This guy, I mean, I did talks to him, you know, going back, I think, like 2018 or something, 2009, 2020, down in Arizona, when he had a thing.
[03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:15.360]  Mark Moss, you know, all these guys have been into these cryptos.
[03:35:16.100 --> 03:35:16.940]  They've made it.
[03:35:18.319 --> 03:35:20.079]  Unfortunately, I didn't buy enough.
[03:35:21.379 --> 03:35:26.079]  But again, it's not what we want, what we like, or what we wish.
[03:35:26.340 --> 03:35:26.979]  It's what is.
[03:35:27.700 --> 03:35:33.559]  And now, you're seeing Europe going down.
[03:35:34.180 --> 03:35:35.040]  Every country.
[03:35:35.219 --> 03:35:36.559]  France is doing lousy.
[03:35:36.680 --> 03:35:40.379]  Look at the political upheavals going on in France.
[03:35:40.540 --> 03:35:41.180]  They're just all off.
[03:35:41.360 --> 03:35:43.459]  Schultz today got a no-confidence vote.
[03:35:44.860 --> 03:35:46.159]  It's one after another.
[03:35:46.340 --> 03:35:46.879]  You look at it.
[03:35:46.979 --> 03:35:51.959]  Matter of fact, There's an article coming out in tomorrow's Trends Journal.
[03:35:52.840 --> 03:35:57.860]  And we mentioned what in the world is going on here.
[03:35:58.180 --> 03:35:59.620]  And it's very important.
[03:36:02.000 --> 03:36:03.079]  Where is that?
[03:36:03.180 --> 03:36:12.440]  It was about the amount of how unpopular politicians are.
[03:36:12.760 --> 03:36:13.219]  There we go.
[03:36:14.340 --> 03:36:17.680]  Citizens look down upon leaders in developed nations.
[03:36:21.280 --> 03:36:33.459]  Leaders in some of the world's richest countries are deeply unpopular and this past year's elections in major countries show that the public is ready to take a stand and vote them out.
[03:36:33.799 --> 03:36:35.579]  Again, this is coming out tomorrow.
[03:36:37.899 --> 03:36:39.979]  We've been warning about this.
[03:36:40.680 --> 03:36:42.319]  Populism is the new way.
[03:36:43.879 --> 03:36:51.950]  You're going to see more and more populist movements and It goes back to what I began talking about.
[03:36:52.489 --> 03:36:53.649]  Tariffs.
[03:36:54.489 --> 03:37:10.489]  More and more countries becoming self-sustaining anti-globalization and, very big and very important, anti-immigration.
[03:37:13.399 --> 03:37:18.579]  Again, tracking trends is the understanding of where we are, how we got here, to see where we're going.
[03:37:20.260 --> 03:37:22.700]  Let's go back to immigration.
[03:37:24.639 --> 03:37:36.239]  When I was a young man, many, many years ago, I'll never forget listening to my parents, may they rest in peace, talking about trying to get their cousin Constantino from Italy to come to America.
[03:37:36.399 --> 03:37:37.440]  They wanted to come live here.
[03:37:37.659 --> 03:37:39.100]  It was very hard to get him here.
[03:37:40.379 --> 03:37:42.280]  The restrictions were so tight.
[03:37:44.840 --> 03:38:04.459]  Then, after they assassinated John F. Kennedy and that slime ball, may he rot in hell, LBJ, LB Jerkoff over there in Texas, got us into the Vietnam War eight months after they assassinated Kennedy.
[03:38:05.139 --> 03:38:07.040]  Now they're drafting all those guys.
[03:38:07.860 --> 03:38:09.659]  They needed more cheap labor.
[03:38:09.959 --> 03:38:10.920]  They needed labor.
[03:38:12.520 --> 03:38:21.280]  That's when they first Lowered the immigration rules to get more people as they were getting us killed.
[03:38:22.219 --> 03:38:37.879]  In my book, Trends 2000, international bestseller, and going back to that slimeball, arrogant piece of scum, crap, little nothing of a clown,
[03:38:38.540 --> 03:38:39.340]  Slick Willie Clinton.
[03:38:42.479 --> 03:38:48.629]  The internet revolution began In the early 1990s when he was president.
[03:38:52.450 --> 03:38:54.489]  People are making a lot of money.
[03:38:55.829 --> 03:39:01.229]  The internet revolution, Silicon Valley is booming in San Francisco.
[03:39:02.129 --> 03:39:03.889]  We need cheap labor.
[03:39:04.909 --> 03:39:07.870]  Ah, they gave us the H1B visas.
[03:39:08.629 --> 03:39:09.250]  Yeah.
[03:39:15.449 --> 03:39:22.370]  And under the Biden administration, immigration's flooding in.
[03:39:22.569 --> 03:39:23.049]  How come?
[03:39:23.629 --> 03:39:26.690]  Again, who wants to work at Target?
[03:39:26.969 --> 03:39:29.090]  Who wants to work at Dollar General?
[03:39:32.690 --> 03:39:35.270]  Who wants to work at a 7-Eleven?
[03:39:37.430 --> 03:39:39.950]  Go to Marshalls, go to any stores.
[03:39:41.290 --> 03:39:43.950]  As you're walking in on the door, help wanted.
[03:39:44.489 --> 03:39:45.590]  Full-time, part-time.
[03:39:47.690 --> 03:39:49.729]  That's why they need all the cheap labor.
[03:39:50.590 --> 03:39:52.750]  Now, make the connections.
[03:39:53.569 --> 03:39:59.950]  I just mentioned, again, how all of these economies are doing so lousy.
[03:40:01.010 --> 03:40:02.209]  One after another.
[03:40:03.149 --> 03:40:07.010]  How unpopular facts are there.
[03:40:07.430 --> 03:40:13.270]  I just read an article, part of an article, about how people are so discontented with the establishment.
[03:40:19.540 --> 03:40:21.260]  Immigration is going to be a huge issue.
[03:40:23.020 --> 03:40:26.620]  But then you have to look at why these people are leaving their countries.
[03:40:29.440 --> 03:40:46.200]  One of our top trends for 2020 that came out just before the COVID war, they come out like January 2nd or the end of December, and the COVID war begins in, you know, a couple of weeks later in January, was new world disorder.
[03:40:47.500 --> 03:40:50.479]  You go back to 2019. Germany was in a recession.
[03:40:50.659 --> 03:40:52.180]  That far from a recession.
[03:40:53.620 --> 03:40:57.000]  The yellow vests in France taking to the streets.
[03:40:58.620 --> 03:41:02.700]  Major, major protests going on in Algeria.
[03:41:02.860 --> 03:41:03.639]  This is a big country.
[03:41:05.340 --> 03:41:06.459]  South Africa.
[03:41:09.040 --> 03:41:09.639]  Chile.
[03:41:11.040 --> 03:41:11.639]  Bolivia.
[03:41:11.819 --> 03:41:13.000]  All over the world.
[03:41:13.440 --> 03:41:17.059]  People taking to the streets because of lack of basic living standards.
[03:41:18.379 --> 03:41:21.260]  Government corruption, crime and violence.
[03:41:21.659 --> 03:41:24.940]  This is before the COVID war.
[03:41:27.940 --> 03:41:31.799]  Now, let's fast forward five years.
[03:41:33.420 --> 03:41:39.540]  I just mentioned how terrible the developed nations economies are doing.
[03:41:40.319 --> 03:41:43.079]  You know how bad it is in the emerging markets?
[03:41:46.860 --> 03:41:52.920]  What are we looking at, according to the, I think, the IMF, the International Monetary Fund?
[03:41:55.340 --> 03:41:58.219]  $100 trillion worth of debt?
[03:42:01.079 --> 03:42:08.700]  This immigration issue is going to be a major, major issue in every campaign, in every developed nation.
[03:42:11.299 --> 03:42:16.950]  And, again, If I'm living in Haiti, man, I want to get out of it.
[03:42:16.989 --> 03:42:17.590]  I hate it.
[03:42:18.549 --> 03:42:20.229]  I'll do anything to get out of it.
[03:42:22.190 --> 03:42:24.129]  And it's one country after another.
[03:42:25.090 --> 03:42:27.950]  So you're going to see more and more populist movements.
[03:42:29.329 --> 03:42:36.729]  And what you're going to see, finally, are new political parties that are for the people.
[03:42:38.049 --> 03:42:40.129]  Not for the corporations.
[03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.909]  Lobbyists.
[03:42:42.950 --> 03:42:44.729]  Isn't that a nice word, lobbyists?
[03:42:45.229 --> 03:42:46.170]  How about gangs?
[03:42:47.670 --> 03:42:50.250]  Money junkies paying you off to do what you're told.
[03:42:50.590 --> 03:42:51.649]  I'm a lobbyist.
[03:42:51.750 --> 03:42:57.149]  I'm a slimeball selling my crap and you're going to buy it and I'm going to give you the money to do it.
[03:42:59.250 --> 03:43:01.850]  And again, talking about crime syndicate.
[03:43:02.889 --> 03:43:05.930]  Look at these banks, the bandits that are running the country.
[03:43:06.069 --> 03:43:09.770]  Look at what they charge you on interest rates for your credit cards.
[03:43:10.510 --> 03:43:12.270]  What is the average, like, 23%?
[03:43:13.250 --> 03:43:15.309]  Hey, the mafia was charging 10%.
[03:43:15.309 --> 03:43:16.290]  We gotta get rid of them.
[03:43:17.809 --> 03:43:18.649]  It's a mafia.
[03:43:19.489 --> 03:43:24.090]  As I said, if all the politicians in this country were Italian, they'd call it a mafia.
[03:43:24.489 --> 03:43:26.110]  I can't stand either party.
[03:43:26.209 --> 03:43:26.729]  They're not a party.
[03:43:27.409 --> 03:43:28.510]  Look, who's your favorite?
[03:43:28.569 --> 03:43:29.510]  Who's your favorite clown?
[03:43:30.530 --> 03:43:32.090]  You know, parties.
[03:43:33.469 --> 03:43:34.790]  Yeah, it's one big party.
[03:43:34.889 --> 03:43:36.430]  Again, you're not invited to it.
[03:43:37.209 --> 03:43:38.850]  So that's where we see things going.
[03:43:39.520 --> 03:43:42.399]  And then now we got to take a look at what's going on in the Middle East.
[03:43:43.420 --> 03:43:52.280]  And with that, not many people saw the overthrow of Assad over there and what's going on now.
[03:43:52.879 --> 03:43:54.780]  So here's a positive note.
[03:43:55.680 --> 03:44:01.459]  This is from, again, as the trend forecasters, we go around the world to hear what everybody's saying.
[03:44:01.659 --> 03:44:08.079]  So like the Israel war, we subscribe, we pay money to go to Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper.
[03:44:09.270 --> 03:44:13.110]  We don't have to pay, but we go to Times of Israel, a Jerusalem Post.
[03:44:13.309 --> 03:44:15.430]  Oh, we want to hear what the Iranians have to say, too.
[03:44:15.549 --> 03:44:18.909]  We go to Press TV, IRNA, ISNA, Tehran Times.
[03:44:19.069 --> 03:44:23.129]  Oh, we want to hear what the Arabs have to say, we go to Arab News, we go to Al Jazeera, et cetera, et cetera, okay?
[03:44:23.569 --> 03:44:25.329]  So this is from Haaretz.
[03:44:26.469 --> 03:44:33.170]  When asked if he trusts Netanyahu, Trump tells Time Magazine, I don't trust anybody.
[03:44:34.090 --> 03:44:35.389]  And again, Time Magazine.
[03:44:37.129 --> 03:44:40.129]  My book, Trend Tracking, far better than Megatrends, Time Magazine.
[03:44:42.469 --> 03:44:49.229]  He said, I think the Middle East war is an easy problem to handle than what's happening with Russia and Ukraine.
[03:44:49.670 --> 03:44:50.170]  Okay?
[03:44:50.430 --> 03:44:51.870]  I just want to say that up front.
[03:44:52.430 --> 03:44:55.489]  The Middle East is going to get solved, Trump says.
[03:44:57.770 --> 03:45:13.399]  He stated, I don't want to say that, but when asked if Netanyahu provided assurances about the war's end, Trump said, I don't want to say that, but I think he feels confident that, I think he feels very confident in me,
[03:45:13.440 --> 03:45:16.799]  and I think he knows I want it to end.
[03:45:20.120 --> 03:45:23.700]  I don't want people from either side killed.
[03:45:24.760 --> 03:45:35.360]  And that includes whether it's Russia, Ukraine, or whether it's the Palestinians and the Israelis.
[03:45:37.239 --> 03:45:42.280]  And all the, you know, the different entities that we have in the Middle East.
[03:45:43.120 --> 03:45:49.059]  Trump further stated that he supports, quote, a plan for peace.
[03:45:51.219 --> 03:46:03.040]  Well, as the man who launched Occupy Peace over a decade ago, and who has major rallies up here in Kingston, New York, I am pro-peace.
[03:46:04.239 --> 03:46:06.159]  And it's Christmas time.
[03:46:07.030 --> 03:46:07.930]  Peace on earth.
[03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:09.649]  Goodwill to all.
[03:46:10.309 --> 03:46:12.190]  So if Trump stands by this.
[03:46:13.469 --> 03:46:14.110]  Amen.
[03:46:15.049 --> 03:46:15.889]  And a women.
[03:46:19.790 --> 03:46:27.030]  When asked if Trump would halt Netanyahu from pursuing annexation, once again Trump said, we'll see what happens.
[03:46:27.690 --> 03:46:28.950]  Yeah, I did.
[03:46:29.090 --> 03:46:29.850]  I stopped him.
[03:46:30.149 --> 03:46:32.270]  But we'll see what happens.
[03:46:33.170 --> 03:46:35.049]  He talks about October 7th.
[03:46:39.419 --> 03:46:42.440]  So, that's what Trump is saying.
[03:46:42.719 --> 03:46:47.840]  In the meantime, Israel is stealing more and more land.
[03:46:48.879 --> 03:46:52.299]  They're stealing that land now more than the Golan Heights.
[03:46:53.440 --> 03:46:56.180]  The international community is coming out against them.
[03:46:56.280 --> 03:46:57.139]  They call it settlers.
[03:46:57.459 --> 03:46:58.159]  They're not settlers.
[03:46:58.440 --> 03:47:04.819]  This is in violation of the Geneva Convention and Article 242 of the United Nations.
[03:47:05.120 --> 03:47:06.020]  They're not settlers.
[03:47:06.540 --> 03:47:08.360]  That colonizes stealing land.
[03:47:09.260 --> 03:47:13.659]  So, very concerned about this war ramping up.
[03:47:14.200 --> 03:47:30.899]  And Netanyahu, as we're writing in this Trends Journal, is talking about ramping up the war with Iran.
[03:47:31.120 --> 03:47:31.780]  Here's one here.
[03:47:33.780 --> 03:47:37.360]  NetYahu set sights on Iran after Assad's fall.
[03:47:38.559 --> 03:47:39.239]  Okay?
[03:47:45.799 --> 03:47:47.100]  Another article.
[03:47:48.079 --> 03:47:55.440]  Israel to surge settler population in stolen Golan Heights and fortify military positions.
[03:47:55.899 --> 03:47:58.920]  So, Trump really has to come out for peace.
[03:47:59.620 --> 03:48:04.069]  And right now, The polls show the people are for him.
[03:48:04.530 --> 03:48:07.149]  And he has a great strong team behind him.
[03:48:07.889 --> 03:48:15.409]  So, as we're going into this, it may be a very Merry Christmas and a very Happy New Year.
