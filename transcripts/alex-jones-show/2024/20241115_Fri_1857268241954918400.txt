[00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:06.230]  All right, I shot a special report on this that I posted at RailOx Jones about two hours ago.
[00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:13.269]  And then I was actually reading the transcripts from the multi-hour emergency court hearing today in federal bankruptcy court in Houston.
[00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.510]  And then I called all the lawyers and talked to them, and they had a total consensus.
[00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:21.070]  They've never seen anything like it.
[00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:28.890]  The words were exactly, this was a private secret sale, basically illegal is the word that's used.
[00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.940]  Basically, it's Crime.
[00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.859]  I mean, bankruptcy crime.
[00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.979]  I mean, on its face.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.380]  Disguised as an auction that wasn't an auction.
[00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:47.600]  And the people didn't even pay real money.
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.179]  They paid some weird fiat thing that wasn't even agreed to by the judge's order.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.759]  And then they had the corporate media say that The Onion bought Infowars.
[00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:04.030]  And then the judge kept saying to the trustee that did this, I didn't give you the authority to do this.
[00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.489]  You were supposed to come to me about an auction.
[00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.469]  This isn't even an auction.
[00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.609]  And then it's just all over the news that they just bought it and they won the bid and they did that.
[00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.930]  But then they quote the US trustee going, well, it's not the highest bid, but it's the best bid.
[00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.530]  These people just, they didn't do anything.
[00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:21.689]  It's crazy.
[00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:34.870]  So, nobody sees how the federal judge, who's known for being straight-laced and not corrupt at all, Judge Chris Lopez, cannot end this fake sale, which he basically said didn't happen.
[00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.870]  He should have an emergency evidentiary hearing sometime next week.
[00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.849]  He hasn't announced the date yet.
[00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:43.870]  And bare minimum, there'll be a new open public auction.
[00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.290]  Probably more is going to happen.
[00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.129]  I mean, this is unprecedented, folks.
[00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.829]  Just like the last trustee he fired back on June 14th, tried to close the building without a court order.
[00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.189]  There's a lot of behind-the-scenes deep state goings on here.
[00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.010]  And this is a big deal.
[00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.750]  I've been up since 5 a.m.
[00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:03.209]  dealing with this.
[00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.950]  I'm about to go to sleep.
[00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.889]  I'll be covering it all live from the new studios at the Alex Jones Network at AJN Live on X. Please follow me there.
[00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.090]  But this is going to be big.
[00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:14.930]  Everybody out there thinking Infowars were shut down.
[00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.210]  You're in for a rude awakening.
