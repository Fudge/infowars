[00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:08.789]  It's Sunday, December 1st, 2024. It's official.
[00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.769]  Trump is going directly to war with the deep state.
[00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:15.949]  InfoWars.
[00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.750]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:01:15.239]  Well, those air raid sirens you hear playing have double meaning both for the world in danger of accelerated World War III that we're already in the beginning stages of the full thermonuclear war and the NATO, CIA, Mossad proxy operations launching huge uprisings and military operations in places like Syria and Georgia in the last 48 hours.
[00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:34.780]  But it also has double meaning for the establishment because the missiles of mass awakening, the explosions of peaceful renaissance are heralding the end of their anti-human death cult reign.
[00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.980]  And not soon enough is it coming to an end, to quote Master Yoda.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.879]  All right.
[00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:51.849]  I've been sitting back the last few weeks Saying, look, most of the Trump appointees are really good.
[00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:52.969]  Some are okay.
[00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:53.909]  Some are horrible.
[00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:04.109]  But I said, Trump understands politics and the economy and the media and what he's up against when it comes to tens of thousands of employees.
[00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:05.549]  He's going to miss some bad people.
[00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:11.210]  And I told all the different talk show hosts and people freaking out about the new Surgeon General and things.
[00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.409]  That's a ceremonial job.
[00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:14.009]  It doesn't matter.
[00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:25.330]  And then he put in this new NIH leader, Jay Bhattacharya, who is about as intelligent and hardcore and on to what's going on as anybody.
[00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:32.729]  I mean, we're talking Dr. Malone level or Dr. Peter McCullough level or...
[00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.979]  I mean, you name it, he is hardcore.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.520]  Well, then you've got Tom Homan to head up the border operation.
[00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:58.280]  And then you've got Kash Patel being announced last night, who totally scares the deep state to death, because he's been fighting for eight years, exposing what the deep state was doing illegally to Trump.
[00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.419]  And he's really smart and got a great intelligence background and is loyal to America.
[00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.300]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:15.889]  Then the things they announced, In just the last few days, you don't announce that unless you're going full-on war with the globalists.
[00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:25.270]  Because when you do announce that, it's going to make the deep state what's left of it, because it's badly coordinated now, not just here, but around the world.
[00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.169]  It's exposed.
[00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.050]  It's unpopular.
[00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.430]  Their own people are blowing the whistle more and more.
[00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.409]  The rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.330]  Or the rats are waking up drowned at the bottom of the ocean in a ship, waking up dead, politically, culturally.
[00:03:41.990 --> 00:04:04.099]  When Homan came out yesterday, and I'm going to play the clip coming up next segment, and said, we're going to prosecute the NGOs that ran the human trafficking up to the government agencies and government officials at the State Department and at DHS. I've known this for a while,
[00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:18.139]  and Flynn, two weeks ago on the show, remotely, he was in her studio last Monday as well, said, yeah, he's been working behind the scenes with the task force Trump's developing, but let's not let it all out yet, because I was laying out.
[00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:26.439]  What the task force should do and how it was going to operate, not even from White House sources.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.259]  I studied this as much as anybody, and that would be the most direct, proper way to do the right thing, save the children, and bring down the whole global system.
[00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.319]  And Flynn's like, stop!
[00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:37.379]  On air and off air.
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.620]  He goes, Alex, you're letting the plan out.
[00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:41.100]  He said that on air, too.
[00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.899]  And I said, well, I'm sorry, I can see the main move.
[00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.019]  We're good guys.
[00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.379]  He said, well, don't worry, it's coming.
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.160]  Holman announced it yesterday.
[00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.709]  Criminal investigations and prosecutions of the Biden administration for human trafficking and sex slavery.
[00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.850]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:15.970]  It is Sunday, December 1st, 2024, and I am going to make some massive, earth-shaking announcements Here tonight,
[00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:29.810]  we are 49 days, 18 hours, 53 minutes, 9 seconds to the inauguration of President Trump on January 20th, 2025. All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:51.759]  The appointments that Trump is putting in as FBI director and as the head of the border operations, the border czar, and his new attorney general and who he's put in over the National Institutes of Health and more,
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:06:11.050]  doesn't just signal total war with the criminal psychotic Deep State, it absolutely has launched it.
[00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.490]  Now, and I didn't see this in my stack.
[00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:16.529]  I almost forgot to send it.
[00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.829]  You guys, I tweeted it last night.
[00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:24.089]  I posted it on X. My post, the President's statement about going to war with BRICS as well.
[00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:27.290]  Please print me the President's statement on that from X. Thank you.
[00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:29.410]  We'll be getting into that as well.
[00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:41.980]  So Trump truly is America first, and he's gonna go after international organizations, countries, and groups that are trying to block America's success and prosperity and security and freedom.
[00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:49.439]  But to do that, he's got to go after the criminals that have hijacked the nation and sold us down the river first.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:06.269]  And I have said at least a thousand times since Biden stole the election four years ago, And accelerated mass human trafficking many of the people put into slave labor and sex slavery,
[00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:07.490]  including small children.
[00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:17.389]  And that's in the Senate reports and all confirmed, but we were there with whistleblowers and insiders and DHS folks that testified to Congress here in this studio.
[00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:22.370]  And the number's way above 325,000.
[00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.029]  That's just what they know that they had and were ordered to release, in many cases, two known pedophiles.
[00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:48.569]  And I have said until your ears bleed that Trump needs to have his new border czar and his head of DHS and his new attorney general and his new FBI director take the gloves off and not just stop the open border,
[00:07:50.709 --> 00:08:06.290]  But find the missing children, free them, save them, rescue them, and then prosecute the NGOs that Obama and then Trump ended it eight years ago,
[00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.769]  and then four years ago Biden brought it back and made it worse than ever, three times worse than Obama.
[00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:12.290]  That's the graphs, that's the numbers.
[00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.110]  At least three times we know.
[00:08:14.269 --> 00:08:16.149]  It's much worse than what we know three times.
[00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:17.550]  What was documented.
[00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.790]  For every crime you know about, there's a lot more going on.
[00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:27.750]  The Border Patrol estimates it's a million missing children under Biden that were disappeared.
[00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:53.759]  So until everybody's ears bled, and let's put that back on screen, that's just one of the interviews with Flynn on November 6th, 25 days ago, President Trump planning to launch a federal task force that will target the giant human trafficking networks controlled by the Democrats slash UN system.
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:02.320]  Now, I knew Flynn had been meeting with Trump's border task force leaders in transition.
[00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:06.120]  And I said, General, I believe this would be the best plan.
[00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:09.220]  And he says on there, he goes, yeah, just stop.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.940]  We don't want him to know too much.
[00:09:11.059 --> 00:09:12.840]  And then later I'm talking to him and he's going, so...
[00:09:13.769 --> 00:09:14.870]  Did you figure this out on your own?
[00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:15.389]  I said, yeah.
[00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.169]  And he goes, yeah, that's it.
[00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:23.330]  I said, you know, and I said this on air too, I said, you know the bad guys already know this is the move.
[00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.090]  I mean, it's what we morally have to do, plus it's going to destroy them.
[00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.309]  Not just here.
[00:09:28.429 --> 00:09:33.549]  The UN, NATO, the whole global crime syndicate at its base is narcotics and human trafficking.
[00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:34.429]  That's their currency.
[00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:37.570]  Weapons and things are a side issue.
[00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:38.429]  They're still big.
[00:09:39.809 --> 00:09:45.169]  And so I harped on this and harped on this and harped on this and harped on this.
[00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:46.549]  I'm just giving you one of the latest examples.
[00:09:49.929 --> 00:10:00.460]  Because you go after the NGOs and And if you've been to the border, and I've been in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas over and over again, and so is my crew.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:15.159]  We've interviewed whistleblowers and union people from the Border Patrol and federal judges and FBI agents and federal marshals that are good people who were telling me, go look at this, go look at that, go investigate this, look at this case, look at that case.
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:30.100]  And it was the Biden administration letting, in some cases, people who've been convicted five times, four times, of raping, kidnapping, you name it, children.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.059]  Murderers, arsonists, people that have shot cops.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.960]  I mean, you name it.
[00:10:38.379 --> 00:11:00.909]  And Merritt Garland, through federal regulations and law, and Trump's set to repeal this, The Justice Department can kill any federal prosecution at once by denying the prosecution from the beginning before they can even go out and get a grand jury.
[00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:04.210]  And I've talked to high-level federal judges.
[00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:05.269]  Told you about this over a year ago.
[00:11:05.669 --> 00:11:06.529]  Talked to multiple ones.
[00:11:08.049 --> 00:11:10.190]  I mean, we talk about head judges.
[00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:26.799]  Where they lay out that it's public knowledge, now this is even secret, that they're not allowed to prosecute somebody, the prosecutors aren't, unless the Justice Department says so.
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.120]  Under the law, they can hold somebody for a month if they're here illegally, that's it.
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:43.519]  But if you're literally caught with a dead kid, the Justice Department in most cases wouldn't even allow the prosecution.
[00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.649]  And of course, they disappear them.
[00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.190]  I thought it was a year and a half ago when it was public.
[00:11:50.429 --> 00:12:05.750]  I didn't know that the day Biden got in, within a few days, he quietly signed a secret order that no DNA testing of children at the border, which only takes a day or so to go through, and it tells you, is it a mom, is it a dad, is it an uncle, is it an aunt, is it a first cousin,
[00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:06.929]  or is it no relation?
[00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:08.669]  Just like that.
[00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:09.710]  Less than a day.
[00:12:11.629 --> 00:12:12.490]  They stopped that.
[00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.269]  Now, it came out in the news a year and a half ago, they stopped it.
[00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.309]  They just told Congress, we don't want the money anymore.
[00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:23.750]  Turns out, going back four years ago, they ended it all so they could help, again, cover up what was happening.
[00:12:23.929 --> 00:12:25.769]  And I've interviewed the whistleblowers here in studio.
[00:12:25.929 --> 00:12:39.809]  It's been in congressional testimony that babies as young as three months old with no paperwork flown on airplanes all over the country and handed to people with no paperwork in fields and Walmart parking lots and on tarmacs.
[00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:46.610]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, if that isn't human trafficking and smuggling and kidnapping, nothing is.
[00:12:47.830 --> 00:13:08.809]  So I have harped and I have harped and I have harped and I have harped that this is one of the biggest hidden in plain view, open and shut, prima facie on its face, ridiculously naked criminal operations ever dreamed of.
[00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:14.379]  I mean, this is Nazi-level stuff or communist...
[00:13:14.379 --> 00:13:16.779]  Soviet...
[00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:20.720]  I mean, they did better jobs at hiding the stuff they were doing.
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:26.460]  This is naked, meaning not hidden out in the open.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.039]  It's the right thing to do to go after them.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.100]  It's the right thing to do to find the kids and save them.
[00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:37.679]  And then it's the Achilles heel of the arrogant deep state...
[00:13:39.009 --> 00:13:46.490]  When you go to the Texas border, go there right now, and there are these giant, you drive every 10, 15 miles, you'll just go, what's that?
[00:13:46.549 --> 00:13:52.350]  It's these huge white tent buildings that go on for football field after football field after football field.
[00:13:52.809 --> 00:14:00.230]  One of them is the equivalent of each building's bigger than a football field, much bigger, and there's seven of them.
[00:14:01.889 --> 00:14:04.870]  Down in McAllen, I mean, you know, it's everywhere.
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.399]  You've all seen the footage, or you've been there.
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:10.879]  We show it all the time.
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:21.539]  And you will see literally purple and green-haired leftist men and women walking around, ordering the Border Patrol and National Guard around.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.820]  They're in charge of them.
[00:14:24.059 --> 00:14:26.960]  And the Border Patrol, everybody said, hey, we're completing the smuggling process.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.659]  This is illegal.
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.419]  It needs to stop.
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.379]  They would get sanctioned.
[00:14:31.419 --> 00:14:32.100]  They would get fired.
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.299]  They would go testify to Congress.
[00:14:33.419 --> 00:14:34.779]  They still did their job and exposed it.
[00:14:36.149 --> 00:14:38.629]  And they begged the American people, please stop this.
[00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.970]  But arrogant Mayorkas just sat up there and continued doing it.
[00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:47.070]  Because they thought they'd be able to steal every future election.
[00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.950]  Yeah, here's footage I shot out of a helicopter.
[00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.809]  And that was like three years ago.
[00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.809]  You go there now, that one facility right there is literally at least five times bigger.
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.960]  Because we've got newer footage, not in a helicopter from the ground we shot about a year ago.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.299]  And I mean, it's just...
[00:15:04.299 --> 00:15:11.480]  And you're talking 50 dump trucks at any time going by, and huge cranes, and just worker crews.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.639]  It looks like a frickin' anthill, okay?
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.580]  And they've got them all over.
[00:15:18.659 --> 00:15:22.960]  Illinois, New York, they've got them deep inside the country as well, where they fly them up there.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.639]  And then they just break them up around the country.
[00:15:24.779 --> 00:15:25.620]  So we have them.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.740]  Because they're engaging in such a mass crime.
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:37.080]  Biden said, once I win, I immediately surged the border, remember, four plus years ago.
[00:15:37.799 --> 00:15:39.200]  Four years and two months ago.
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:52.080]  And then, just because the head of the State Department said do it, or just because the head of DHS said do it, Mayorkas, or just because they waved a magic wand, doesn't mean that that wasn't all completely illegal.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:16:02.039]  And doesn't mean when they find the children, many of which they've been found by third parties, raped, killed, in slavery, you get the NGOs first.
[00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:06.679]  Because they were the main group in command.
[00:16:06.919 --> 00:16:11.480]  And then you go right above the funding to the big tax-free foundations.
[00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:30.100]  And then the federal funding up into the people that gave the orders of the State Department and DHS. And now you have the new border czar, Tom Homan, saying we're going after the NGOs, the UN, and the Biden administration officials that did this.
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.519]  And again...
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:49.240]  It's like when the police go to Jeffrey Dahmer's house, because the neighbor's reporting, hey, we think he's killing people in there, and they go in and there's a dude's head in the refrigerator, there's a bunch of bodies in barrels, and there's photos and videos, you know, he's shot of him torturing people to death.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.879]  It's open and shut, baby.
[00:16:52.379 --> 00:17:00.919]  I mean, this is like when they go to John Wayne Gacy's house, there's, you know, whatever it is, 23 or whatever it was, young men buried in the basement.
[00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:01.820]  I mean...
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:09.819]  Your ass is going on death row if there's any justice.
[00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:26.799]  So, I mean, it's like Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey Oswald on live Dallas television, national television, just walking up the revolver, pow, pow, pow.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.099]  I mean, Jack Ruby did it.
[00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:33.119]  There is no doubt about it.
[00:17:34.109 --> 00:17:34.950]  All right, I'm impressed.
[00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.309]  I just said Jack Ruby and they pulled it up in three seconds.
[00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:38.230]  How the hell did you do that?
[00:17:38.829 --> 00:17:39.910]  I didn't tell them to do that.
[00:17:41.009 --> 00:17:46.609]  Yeah, just fill up TV footage of Jack Ruby killing Lee Harvey Oswald.
[00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:49.690]  Yeah, they had the press conference.
[00:17:49.829 --> 00:17:51.890]  They walk him through the tunnel and Jack Ruby's waiting.
[00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.210]  The cops step back so he can do it.
[00:17:53.289 --> 00:17:53.869]  They were in on it.
[00:17:54.089 --> 00:17:54.890]  Pow, pow, pow.
[00:17:55.049 --> 00:18:05.829]  I mean, the crimes that Mayorkas and Harris and all of them have committed It's as open and shut as Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey Oswald at Point Black Range.
[00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.490]  I mean, it's open and shut, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:16.369]  And now, Tom Homan has a long, illustrious career.
[00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:17.950]  He's already been one of the top Border Patrol guys.
[00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.069]  He said, nope, I've been greenlit by Trump.
[00:18:22.069 --> 00:18:25.690]  We're criminally coming after you, and you can bet they are.
[00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.890]  Now, wow, that's exciting.
[00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:28.490]  That's amazing.
[00:18:28.589 --> 00:18:29.769]  That makes me feel proud to be an American.
[00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.650]  But it also makes me think about second and third order.
[00:18:35.609 --> 00:18:44.009]  Meaning, you look at the one objective, find the kids, free them, prosecute the globalists, and the next order, bring down their whole system internationally, because that's how they operate.
[00:18:44.009 --> 00:18:48.289]  This is really like a sweater where you get one string and it pulls the whole sweater apart.
[00:18:48.589 --> 00:18:49.670]  That's what this is.
[00:18:50.289 --> 00:18:50.690]  Guaranteed.
[00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:56.869]  And if this was happening, we've already got like a whole arm of the sweater off, and now we're up to the neck and the whole sweater is falling apart.
[00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.349]  Really fast.
[00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:02.200]  And the globalists know that.
[00:19:02.359 --> 00:19:08.000]  It's like when the water gets dumped on the witch in The Wizard of Oz, I'm melting, I'm melting.
[00:19:08.119 --> 00:19:10.119]  I mean, they're melting right now.
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:18.980]  But if the witch would have thought, while she was melting, she could have thrown some thunderbolts at Dorothy, but she didn't.
[00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:21.220]  And that's what I want to say in that analogy.
[00:19:21.579 --> 00:19:24.700]  The witch is going to melt and end up being a puddle of slime on the ground.
[00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:29.400]  But do you think they're going to try to...
[00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.269]  Throw some thunderbolts, throw some fireballs at us while they're going.
[00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:34.410]  Oh, you bet they are.
[00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:35.809]  Because this isn't a movie.
[00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.210]  And they're not a witch.
[00:19:37.329 --> 00:19:38.210]  There's something far worse.
[00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.589]  So, we better be talking about that.
[00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.470]  I mean, they are going to try to poison Holman.
[00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.049]  He better be watching what he drinks and eats.
[00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:49.750]  That's because they don't want to lionize him.
[00:19:50.109 --> 00:19:52.069]  They're going to really try to poison Trump.
[00:19:52.069 --> 00:19:56.650]  He should have never sat down next to Justin Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago Saturday night or Friday night.
[00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:57.390]  That's so dangerous.
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.740]  At this point, they might not shoot down his plane because that's too obvious.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:10.279]  They're going to go with poison or electromagnetic type Havana syndrome stuff.
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:22.799]  But I mean, look, their only move now is to launch a cyber attack and cut off the power and blame Russia and create so much hysteria that they think that'll let them declare martial law before Trump gets in in 49 days.
[00:20:24.019 --> 00:20:24.700]  Poison Trump.
[00:20:26.779 --> 00:20:33.180]  Keep attacking Russia and Russia's stupid and launches an attack so big back that NATO has an excuse to go to nuclear war.
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.740]  And notice they're trying that.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.619]  And it's not like I just heard him saying that a few weeks ago.
[00:20:36.759 --> 00:20:38.119]  I've been saying it for months and months and months.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.539]  He becomes president-elect.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:48.420]  They're going to try to start World War III. They got some big false flags up their sleeves to attack a group of migrants and then blame it on Trump.
[00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:49.559]  But that's once he gets in.
[00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:57.529]  Out of the blue, they keep saying Trump's going to murder a bunch of black people with no evidence, so look for that false flag coming to try to get us all killing each other.
[00:20:57.609 --> 00:21:01.109]  I think most people are smart enough to not go along with that.
[00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:12.150]  So, I'm going to play the new clip of home, but I'm sorry, I'm just obsessing with the border thing for the last 20 minutes.
[00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:29.190]  Then you've got Kash Patel, who for eight years in the Trump administration has His deputy head of intelligence analysis warned Trump about everything, told him day one what was happening,
[00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.289]  back when I was telling Trump as well.
[00:21:32.109 --> 00:21:35.890]  And as time went on, Patel got listened to more and more because he was dead on.
[00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:40.410]  And then of course, he's a loyalist, he's a smart guy.
[00:21:41.819 --> 00:21:44.480]  This is totally loyal to America, loyal to freedom.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:22:09.950]  This is totally a doomsday scenario for the political, globalist, New World Order, FBI, where people get into the FBI, they get into the intelligence section of it to serve the globalists and then get a revolving door job in the New World Order corporate system and then they get promoted back higher in the FBI and then back into the globalist system and then Finally,
[00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:15.769]  you know, the top of the FBI. And Kash Patel explains all of that.
[00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.930]  I mean, you listen to him, he sounds like me or Elon Musk.
[00:22:22.069 --> 00:22:24.069]  It's because we're looking at the same thing.
[00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.970]  We're not singing off the same sheet of music.
[00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:30.630]  We're looking at the same animal.
[00:22:30.869 --> 00:22:33.549]  You go to the zoo with your wife and kids, you go, there's the elephant.
[00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:34.750]  You all know it's an elephant.
[00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:42.250]  Now, the left, though, it's all based on fraud and lies and gaslighting and brainwashing.
[00:22:42.309 --> 00:22:43.309]  Oh, look, that's a woman.
[00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:44.069]  No, that's a man.
[00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:49.150]  But with reality-based people, it's so simple once you understand what you're facing.
[00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:58.730]  And then you've got his new head of NIH, which, again, is his hardcore, it sounds like RFK Jr., just as informed or more.
[00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:03.329]  You've got Jay Bhattacharya.
[00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.950]  I mean...
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.380]  Trump is putting some hardcore people in.
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:15.140]  And he's got this new lady at DOJ. She's hardcore.
[00:23:16.019 --> 00:23:19.640]  She's in the liberty cult.
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.059]  And everything's a cult, folks.
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.500]  There's the leftist cult, the transhumanist cult, the death cult.
[00:23:24.599 --> 00:23:25.180]  That's what we're fighting.
[00:23:25.339 --> 00:23:27.839]  Yeah, we're in the freedom cult.
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:28.740]  We're in the Jesus cult.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.660]  We're in the prosperity cult.
[00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:31.980]  We're in the straight shooter cult.
[00:23:33.109 --> 00:23:34.809]  We're in the honorable cult.
[00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:36.490]  We're in the freedom cult.
[00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:37.529]  Yeah, that's what we are.
[00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:38.990]  1776, we're all about it.
[00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:44.890]  And our cult was so good, the whole rest of the world in the last 150 years tried to model itself off us.
[00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:47.809]  Not that we were perfect, but we were the best.
[00:23:49.430 --> 00:24:00.029]  And so I've always bet on you and always believe that as their new world order, globalist, anti-human, stinking, great reset, you will eat the bugs, own nothing, be happy crap rolled out.
[00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:01.549]  I'm like, you know what?
[00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:03.109]  I don't think we are going to be happy.
[00:24:03.309 --> 00:24:09.069]  Well, you fly around your big jet airplanes and, you know, do all this and tell us old ladies they can't even have...
[00:24:10.359 --> 00:24:11.960]  Gas for heating in the winter.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:19.619]  I mean, just know we reject your Hollywood, globalist, satanic, selfish, disgusting, austerity crap.
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:29.299]  And the world's waking up to you, and if you thought you'd shut down Alex Jones the last eight years, well, now you've got everybody else to deal with, and I love it.
[00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:40.390]  Because I don't see all these other big talk show hosts and world leaders and politicians and top lawyers and theologians all sounding just like me.
[00:24:40.869 --> 00:24:44.230]  Well, I've been telling you for years, that's what the goal here.
[00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.690]  Because I know I'm seeing straight.
[00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:52.869]  I know I see for miles and miles and miles and miles, just like the Who says.
[00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.390]  And I want to win.
[00:24:59.599 --> 00:25:04.140]  I couldn't believe it over the last 30 years that the globalists published their plans.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.819]  They're in almost total control.
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:12.519]  They admit their plan to collapse civilization and literally exterminate 90 plus percent of us.
[00:25:13.579 --> 00:25:21.079]  You got the politicians and lawyers that wrote the Obamacare go on C-SPAN and go, it triples prices.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:25.880]  We want to collapse healthcare and not give people healthcare so they don't live as long.
[00:25:27.349 --> 00:25:28.890]  And I play the clip.
[00:25:29.069 --> 00:25:30.430]  I'm just like, really?
[00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:32.029]  We're going to put up with this?
[00:25:32.109 --> 00:25:37.769]  I mean, it's not hard to beat these people if you just admit they're pure murderous scum that hate your guts.
[00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:45.029]  They thought they'd traffic 325,000 plus missing little kids.
[00:25:46.609 --> 00:25:49.569]  On record in human slavery and sex slavery?
[00:25:49.809 --> 00:25:51.849]  And that arrogant son of a bitch?
[00:25:52.069 --> 00:25:53.869]  It's not even, that's mean to bastards.
[00:25:53.869 --> 00:25:54.730]  That creature?
[00:25:55.069 --> 00:25:56.630]  That demon, Mayorka?
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.160]  Smurking and smugly, just giggling in front of Congress.
[00:26:02.579 --> 00:26:05.920]  Well, he's not going to be laughing soon, and it's come out in the news.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:16.380]  He's up there trying to negotiate deals, quote, to not be prosecuted after he leaves, claiming all his immunity, and, you know, oh, I'll turn state's evidence against this group.
[00:26:16.579 --> 00:26:18.099]  We have them routed.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.599]  We have the rats leaving the sinking ship.
[00:26:20.859 --> 00:26:22.059]  This is beautiful.
[00:26:22.059 --> 00:26:22.980]  And you know what?
[00:26:24.319 --> 00:26:36.279]  When they tried to kill Trump, not once, not twice, it's been more than that, I can tell you, he finally understood these are pure evil and they cannot be dealt with with negotiations.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.200]  They have to be defeated and crushed.
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:44.779]  We are in a death battle, an existential life and death struggle with these people.
[00:26:45.789 --> 00:26:47.130]  They're not going to give you a quarter.
[00:26:47.289 --> 00:26:48.210]  They're not going to back down.
[00:26:48.369 --> 00:27:01.430]  Their main mission is turn the power off, turn your medicine off, take your jobs away to then make you capitulate to a global cashless society, social credit score, universal basic income, where you can then be induced into euthanasia.
[00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:03.309]  Okay?
[00:27:03.569 --> 00:27:04.769]  People are like, oh, this is depressing.
[00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:09.369]  No, it's good news to know how bad the enemy is because then people won't go along with them.
[00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.470]  You have to admit the full horror to defeat them.
[00:27:11.549 --> 00:27:12.369]  That's the trick.
[00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:13.450]  And it's happening.
[00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:16.710]  All right, so we got the huge news coming up.
[00:27:16.829 --> 00:27:17.230]  Stay with us.
[00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:29.150]  You know, I have said over and over again that the escalation into World War III, and we are in the first stages of it, as I told you three weeks ago, that's now mainstream news.
[00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:33.690]  All these different world leaders say, no, we're already in the beginning of World War III. The question is, will it go nuclear?
[00:27:34.329 --> 00:27:37.930]  I thought that could get me the most excited ever, which it did.
[00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:55.990]  But now, on the positive front, To know that Trump's developed his task force, to know that Trump said he's going to end the human trafficking and the sex slavery and all the rest of it, and then to have his new border czar head,
[00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:10.789]  who has been known for decades and decades, 40, almost 50 years of service as hardcore, and how arrogant the deep state was about this human trafficking, hiding it in plain view and disappearing the kids and others on purpose and putting them into hell on earth.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.779]  It's just incredible.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.460]  And again, I get chills when I talk about it.
[00:28:17.819 --> 00:28:20.200]  The globalists are completely cornered.
[00:28:20.279 --> 00:28:22.240]  And I've got so many other examples.
[00:28:22.759 --> 00:28:34.440]  George Clooney comes out publicly now and says Obama set him up to run the coup against Biden.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.720]  Yeah, you're playing general, punk.
[00:28:37.859 --> 00:28:38.779]  That's coming out.
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.759]  I mean, they are all turning on each other.
[00:28:41.839 --> 00:28:50.000]  You know, that was illegal as hell to disappear Biden for eight days and put out a fake resignation letter that was a fake signature and no presidential seal or even letterhead.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:56.460]  I said, my God, I wrote better fake absentee notes.
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:02.220]  I did that a few times to my principal, to my teachers.
[00:29:03.019 --> 00:29:06.680]  I mean, I wrote better letters in my mother's hand than they did.
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:09.980]  I mean, that's serious coup.
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:13.279]  That's a crime to make her the nominee.
[00:29:13.859 --> 00:29:19.980]  But see, they just thought we can human traffic, we can start World War III, we can smuggle kids, give them to pedophiles, whatever we want.
[00:29:22.759 --> 00:29:33.259]  Billions of dollars funded by the Pritzkers and others to literally brainwash without parents knowing and put kids into cults in public and private school to fast track them to be sterilized.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.279]  I mean, these are some bold creatures.
[00:29:37.019 --> 00:29:38.920]  But that's the nature of megalomania.
[00:29:39.099 --> 00:29:40.319]  They were in control.
[00:29:40.319 --> 00:29:41.799]  They're still in partial control.
[00:29:41.819 --> 00:29:44.420]  And they thought, let's just do whatever the hell we want.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.640]  Let's not think about second and third order consequences.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.380]  If you don't know what second and third and fourth order consequences are, just type it into Google.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.119]  It still gives a half decent definition.
[00:29:58.259 --> 00:30:06.299]  Or ask chat GPT. Either tonight or tomorrow, I'll do another interview with ChatGPT live on air.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.279]  Ask the computer that.
[00:30:07.759 --> 00:30:08.859]  I'll give you a better answer.
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:09.440]  You can, too.
[00:30:09.579 --> 00:30:14.720]  But second-order approximation, not just consequences.
[00:30:15.759 --> 00:30:29.180]  Approximation just means what is the second-order effects, is what is the long-term effects of a decision and also known as hidden consequences of First order consequences, the immediate feelings or results of a decision.
[00:30:29.339 --> 00:30:31.680]  Second order consequences, the long-term effects of a decision.
[00:30:32.079 --> 00:30:36.400]  Third order consequences, the significant long-term impact of a decision and eventual outcome.
[00:30:36.539 --> 00:30:55.900]  Now let me tell you, fourth order is taking hundreds or thousands of different decisions and scenarios and in Hegelian dialect, integrating them together to combine them And on a mass scale,
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.160]  compute what that would probably do.
[00:31:01.779 --> 00:31:15.119]  Now, the globalists use second, third, fourth order thinking, but they're so greedy to have power now and want it so fast that they just can't help it when they can smash somebody right now, right away.
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.700]  Not to think about what's that going to do.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.019]  So...
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:44.759]  Trump has done the second, third order thinking on what directly going to war and going right after the heart of the globalist program, human trafficking, slave labor, sex slavery, women, children, and men, mainly women and children,
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:45.759]  all over the world.
[00:31:46.079 --> 00:31:50.019]  I mean, the UN, NATO, thousands of articles, thousands of cases.
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.440]  And even 20 years ago, they used to get in trouble for it.
[00:31:54.519 --> 00:31:57.039]  They've had such control the last decade, they never even get in trouble for it.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.359]  I mean, massive, giant programs.
[00:32:01.799 --> 00:32:09.099]  Millions of people disappeared out of Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia.
[00:32:09.759 --> 00:32:10.420]  Millions.
[00:32:12.019 --> 00:32:14.859]  Industrial-level sex slavery of children.
[00:32:15.059 --> 00:32:16.799]  Industrial-level snuff films.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:22.579]  There's places you can go all over the world and strangle a kid for the right price.
[00:32:25.119 --> 00:32:26.700]  I mean, this is sick.
[00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:37.509]  But they do it because it's a secret so evil and so horrible that the people going to be involved in it, most of them know they're being inducted into a cult because you don't just pay the money.
[00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:43.089]  You now have to do service to the cult that fed your satanic desire.
[00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:48.309]  You're like, oh, like an initiation ritual.
[00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:49.390]  Yeah.
[00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:52.369]  I'm Mo Green.
[00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:55.849]  I made my bones when you were banging cheerleaders.
[00:32:58.089 --> 00:32:58.829]  From the godfather.
[00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:03.410]  That's just the good old fashioned sweet Italian mafia.
[00:33:03.569 --> 00:33:04.930]  Little angels compared to this.
[00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:10.089]  Gotta be Sicilian.
[00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:12.670]  Both sides of your family.
[00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:16.609]  And gotta kill people.
[00:33:17.009 --> 00:33:19.690]  So they got dirt on you and know you'll do it.
[00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:23.349]  That is the initiation ritual there.
[00:33:25.359 --> 00:33:27.339]  What's the initiation ritual for MS-13?
[00:33:27.559 --> 00:33:30.200]  You gotta torture an innocent person to death as Satan.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:30.880]  Look it up.
[00:33:33.059 --> 00:33:33.539]  Oh.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.240]  What do you think it is to get into the New World Order death cult?
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:38.759]  You don't just screw kids.
[00:33:38.759 --> 00:33:40.039]  You kill kids.
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:54.440]  So, if you wanna bring down the New World Order and do the right thing in front of God...
[00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:57.230]  You go after this.
[00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:59.990]  And what's the poison shots?
[00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:02.210]  Killed at least 30 million people according to insurance actuaries.
[00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:04.089]  You get the medical system to do it.
[00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:05.009]  They're compartmentalized.
[00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:05.849]  Most of them don't know.
[00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.409]  But once they find out they killed a bunch of people, what did most of them do?
[00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:23.750]  They side with the system and the insurance companies and the big pharma outfits and the corporate media and cover up what they were a part of and now they've been corrupted and now they can launch more deadly viruses and more deadly shots.
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:25.860]  It's called a corruption.
[00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:34.300]  Just like the trans agenda, sterilize kids, mutilate kids, induct them in public and private schools.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.199]  Oh, don't tell the parents that we've convinced the kid they're another sex.
[00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:42.079]  It's a cult.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.760]  It's cult programming.
[00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:51.760]  And a lot of people will finally wake up out of a cult when things get bad enough, but others will just commit deeper to the cult.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:52.780]  We'll talk about that next hour.
[00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:58.159]  And start self-harming and start committing suicide, which lepers are doing all over the world.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:07.960]  Women are becoming sterilized as a protest, not just shaving their heads for a non-existent imaginary threat of Donald Trump.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.820]  These are sciences of control that are ancient.
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:29.070]  So, All these legends aren't legends.
[00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.010]  They're based on real things that went on.
[00:35:31.849 --> 00:35:33.710]  And now you don't have to read legends.
[00:35:33.869 --> 00:35:45.570]  You can look around you and you can experience the California legislature passed the bill reducing penalties to a misdemeanor two days in jail for oral and anal sex with willing children.
[00:35:47.159 --> 00:35:51.079]  Now, if it's vaginal, you might get them pregnant, and that's a bigger crime to make a new human.
[00:35:51.179 --> 00:35:53.659]  So if you can't kill them outright, you want to kill their innocence.
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.039]  But don't commit the crime of maybe making another person.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.059]  So vaginal rape, still a felony.
[00:36:01.639 --> 00:36:04.940]  Anal rape, or oral rape, A-OK in California.
[00:36:05.179 --> 00:36:05.920]  Two days in jail.
[00:36:06.199 --> 00:36:06.599]  Law.
[00:36:09.679 --> 00:36:12.239]  This is the externalization of their evil.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:22.559]  This is this cult coming out in the open, and it came out in the open, and they almost took over America, and they almost defeated us, but we've turned the tide, but we haven't won the war yet.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:39.889]  So I'm going to lay out now Kash Patel, Tom Homan, A whole bunch of the other people Trump's put in.
[00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:41.590]  His new Attorney General.
[00:36:42.449 --> 00:36:44.710]  By the way, Patel doesn't have to get past confirmation.
[00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:48.030]  He'll be put in.
[00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:51.789]  And it all...
[00:36:54.049 --> 00:36:56.849]  Tells you Trump has gone the complete warpath against them.
[00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:57.429]  Because why?
[00:36:57.789 --> 00:36:59.610]  Trump knows they're not going to negotiate.
[00:36:59.789 --> 00:37:00.829]  Trump knows they're not going to give up.
[00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:02.429]  Trump knows they're not going to back down.
[00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:04.070]  Trump knows everybody tried to kill him.
[00:37:04.449 --> 00:37:06.010]  Trump knows they're going to destroy the planet.
[00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:10.889]  So, Trump is fully committed going for the jugular.
[00:37:11.809 --> 00:37:12.690]  Remember that thing?
[00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:18.190]  There's a video somewhere, famously, of a Ron Paul goes, it's happening, it's happening.
[00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.019]  Well, It's happening.
[00:37:21.199 --> 00:37:25.059]  There's Sunday Night Live's headline at Infowars.com and on Exit Real Alex Jones.
[00:37:25.139 --> 00:37:26.000]  Be sure to share the live feed.
[00:37:26.099 --> 00:37:26.840]  This is big news.
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:29.880]  Trump goes on total warpath against the deep state.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.380]  Incoming administration announces plan to prosecute Biden administration for human trafficking and sex slavery.
[00:37:37.719 --> 00:37:38.280]  Woo!
[00:37:41.059 --> 00:37:45.920]  Can we get a little compilation of Ric Flair, please?
[00:37:48.809 --> 00:37:49.730]  I'm going to explain something.
[00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:51.989]  People say, is Elon Musk for real?
[00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:55.710]  I don't even need to ask myself that.
[00:37:56.730 --> 00:38:09.949]  The fruits of the tree are devastating to the globalist and irrevocably good for humanity, being pro-humanity, having children, celebrating free will.
[00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:13.710]  Devastating globalist operations.
[00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:19.829]  And it's the same thing with these announcements by Homan and the announcements by Kash Patel and others.
[00:38:21.969 --> 00:38:23.610]  And the new Attorney General.
[00:38:23.909 --> 00:38:26.949]  You don't put the genie back in the bottle.
[00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:37.289]  When the new border czar comes out and says, we're going to investigate and prosecute from the NGOs to the UN to the federal government.
[00:38:37.289 --> 00:38:38.650]  He's saying...
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:55.460]  What they fired Lou Dobbs off of Fox Business for, what was it, six, seven years ago, when he showed the federal documents that the State Department was giving George Soros billions of dollars a year to flood Europe and the United States with smuggled humans.
[00:39:00.559 --> 00:39:01.800]  Now, I know that.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.699]  You know that.
[00:39:05.539 --> 00:39:07.820]  But they can't have that out there.
[00:39:11.639 --> 00:39:17.179]  So, when Tom Homan says, I've talked to the president and our task force, we're going to arrest the people that did this.
[00:39:18.039 --> 00:39:18.440]  Yes!
[00:39:20.039 --> 00:39:21.400]  You're not going to give us quarter?
[00:39:21.739 --> 00:39:22.559]  Well, guess what?
[00:39:22.619 --> 00:39:23.900]  We're not going to give you quarter anymore.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:30.579]  And if you don't know what that means in old-fashioned medieval war, it means a fight to the death, baby.
[00:39:32.219 --> 00:39:38.039]  And I don't mean literally we're fighting to the death, though that's what the globals would like to get it down to because we're losing the info war.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.300]  It means politically there's no prisoners taken.
[00:39:41.739 --> 00:39:43.219]  You're not taking prisoners.
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.940]  We're not taking prisoners.
[00:39:45.679 --> 00:39:46.539]  That's good.
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.300]  Let's roll up our sleeves right now.
[00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:52.420]  You're looking for the fight?
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.460]  Well, you came to the right place.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:00.119]  I'm glad we can get past all this talk.
[00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:01.949]  All the games.
[00:40:02.369 --> 00:40:04.630]  Yeah, you pulled out all the stops on us, didn't you?
[00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:12.090]  And you thought we were just gonna go get in a fetal position and piss all over ourselves.
[00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:15.730]  Well, I think you're starting to find out something a little bit different, aren't you?
[00:40:18.339 --> 00:40:25.820]  Because Admiral Yamamoto followed his orders from the Emperor of Japan, and he said, look, they got a giant industrial base.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.760]  We sneak attack and take out those battleships.
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:31.199]  They've already got a bunch of aircraft carriers, which he predicted wouldn't be there.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.300]  He could smell the setup.
[00:40:32.559 --> 00:40:38.599]  And he said, they will rapidly build a giant military in a year, and they will come here, and they will kill us.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.340]  And the Emperor did not understand the military.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.039]  He said, no, do it.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:52.260]  And he wrote to his wife after they blew up Pearl Harbor and killed 3,000 American sailors and Marines.
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:57.440]  And he said, I fear we have awoken a sleeping giant.
[00:40:57.659 --> 00:40:58.940]  You can pull it up in Japanese.
[00:41:00.239 --> 00:41:02.019]  Beautiful handwriting.
[00:41:07.059 --> 00:41:08.820]  Oh yeah, that's what you did.
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.039]  That's what you did.
[00:41:12.469 --> 00:41:13.550]  And I've been through a lot of hell.
[00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:14.550]  I've been persecuted a lot.
[00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:15.250]  So is my family.
[00:41:15.369 --> 00:41:15.929]  So is my crew.
[00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:17.250]  So yeah, I'll be honest with you.
[00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:34.210]  I am so thankful to God to keep me alive and on air to this point to see the tide completely turn and to know that these people are going to be absolutely brought to justice because there's no other way.
[00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:36.670]  They wanted the total war.
[00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:39.690]  They wanted to go all the way.
[00:41:40.809 --> 00:41:42.889]  They wanted to pull us in prison.
[00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:46.230]  Oh God, a Trump kid said he'll put us in prison.
[00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:49.110]  Yeah, because you smuggled little kids in sex slavery.
[00:41:50.449 --> 00:41:52.010]  Yeah, you have to go to jail.
[00:41:52.489 --> 00:41:55.150]  Or we are abetting you.
[00:41:55.429 --> 00:41:57.469]  We are aiding and abetting you.
[00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:59.369]  I will not aid and abet you.
[00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:00.809]  And I'll be honest with everybody.
[00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:02.409]  I've said this very calmly.
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:10.519]  And I've said behind the scenes, when people are calling up thanking me and, you know, the stuff that happens after somebody wins an election, I just say, listen, I don't want any thanks.
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.659]  I want delivery.
[00:42:15.039 --> 00:42:19.320]  I want the globalists prosecuted for the human trafficking.
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.420]  I want the Florida out of the water.
[00:42:22.639 --> 00:42:28.840]  I want us out of the UN. I want the DEI shutdown.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.619]  I want their whole agenda dismantled.
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:37.119]  And I want to organize society against Never-11.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.059]  It happened again.
[00:42:38.199 --> 00:42:38.860]  That's what I want.
[00:42:43.239 --> 00:42:45.440]  I don't want to wear tuxedos at Mar-a-Lago.
[00:42:45.559 --> 00:42:46.219]  Nothing against that.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.059]  I don't want to run around and, you know, like be in the cool club.
[00:42:49.239 --> 00:42:51.440]  I want to crush the globalist.
[00:42:52.019 --> 00:42:54.260]  I want to defeat the new world order.
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.760]  Conan, what is greatest in life?
[00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:03.550]  To crush your enemies.
[00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:05.829]  To see them driven before you.
[00:43:06.269 --> 00:43:07.829]  And the lamentation of the women.
[00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:11.150]  Well, I'll forget crying women and children.
[00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:11.929]  I'm not looking for that.
[00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:14.329]  But I want our enemies crushed.
[00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:16.130]  That is greatest in life.
[00:43:16.289 --> 00:43:18.590]  Because then the innocent are protected.
[00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:20.750]  To crush our enemies.
[00:43:21.269 --> 00:43:23.050]  To see them driven before you.
[00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:29.510]  So, we are now seeing them driven before us.
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:34.599]  And if they start World War III and nuclear war, they lose.
[00:43:35.039 --> 00:43:38.420]  And if they cut the power off, we know they did it, they lose.
[00:43:38.579 --> 00:43:40.519]  If they kill Trump, they lose.
[00:43:40.619 --> 00:43:42.800]  If Trump lives, they lose.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:46.659]  Alex Jones stays on the air, they lose.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.840]  Alex Jones has taken off the air, they lose.
[00:43:49.099 --> 00:43:51.500]  The world is awakening.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.619]  At the current awakened point, they're done.
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:57.179]  And it's just started, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:58.719]  Oh yeah!
[00:44:00.449 --> 00:44:05.090]  The New World Order's got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see.
[00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:11.809]  There won't be much left of me when you're through with me.
[00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:20.309]  So, we haven't won yet, but they've already lost.
[00:44:20.469 --> 00:44:21.130]  See what I'm saying?
[00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:24.710]  Only question is, can they take us with them?
[00:44:26.469 --> 00:44:31.070]  And at this point, these people are such scum.
[00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:33.929]  If God just blew the whole planet up right now, I wouldn't blame God.
[00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.250]  Would you?
[00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:36.210]  But God loves us a lot.
[00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:37.389]  God's going to give us another chance.
[00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:38.690]  Maybe even another one, another one.
[00:44:39.289 --> 00:44:40.050]  So, look.
[00:44:40.289 --> 00:44:41.170]  Here's what's going on.
[00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:49.090]  These are epic clips of Homan and of Patel.
[00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:50.469]  And I'm going to get to those next hour.
[00:44:51.210 --> 00:45:09.010]  I want to get to a clip, and we'll put it on screen, from November 7th, Just two days after the election with General Flynn, former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, where I'm proposing what the main first mission should be that will take down the deep state system,
[00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:13.789]  totally turn the public fully against them, and roll them up worldwide.
[00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:16.909]  Here's a little bit of that compilation, and now it's all happening.
[00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:18.570]  We'll come back next hour with all the details.
[00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:19.090]  Here it is.
[00:45:20.329 --> 00:45:27.710]  Two, three, four-year-old children, babies, right, up to teenagers, but babies that are out there being sex-slaved.
[00:45:27.849 --> 00:45:28.889]  This is sickening.
[00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:38.050]  And so this has got to be, like, sort of a first priority within this campaign, because that's part of what we, as Americans, should do.
[00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:42.650]  If we want to say we maintain the moral high ground, we should immediately go after this.
[00:45:44.529 --> 00:46:00.030]  A component of all this is, of course, to go after these criminals that we know came in with the illegal invasion, the terrorists that we know that came in that are on the books right now of the FBI and the CIA and all these other agencies, and clearly under DHS. These people know this.
[00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:06.550]  And we have people inside the government right now, some of whom are whistleblowers who are ready to go to work for us.
[00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:10.969]  And there's others that I know that are in the government that have been crushed.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.960]  When they have risen their heads to talk about this kind of stuff.
[00:46:14.079 --> 00:46:21.000]  As you said, go after the serious criminal gangs so the public sees it's the right thing to do and that Trump's protecting them.
[00:46:21.139 --> 00:46:23.659]  It legitimizes everything else he's doing that's the right thing to do.
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:32.460]  Go after the criminal gangs, go after the terrorists, and that's the war right there that's That's real and unifying and right.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.059]  People totally get behind him.
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:45.340]  Then the human trafficking at the same time, which goes right to the Democrats and the NGOs, and then that is the domino that's the right thing to do as well that brings them all down.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:53.980]  And I think people need to understand that the NGOs, there's a lot of churches, a lot of faith-based organizations that are involved in this kind of stuff.
[00:46:54.119 --> 00:46:56.239]  So this has got to be one of these...
[00:46:57.869 --> 00:47:10.510]  I don't use the word ruthless, but there's got to be a ruthlessness to the campaign that this undertakes, because some of these NGOs are directly involved, and we know exactly who they are.
[00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:16.030]  Some of these are faith-based organizations that hide behind that, and we know exactly who they are.
[00:47:16.369 --> 00:47:20.090]  And I will tell you, I keep a I keep a list right here.
[00:47:20.369 --> 00:47:21.670]  I'll show you this right here.
[00:47:21.989 --> 00:47:22.389]  Okay?
[00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:25.210]  This is my enemy terrain.
[00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:28.190]  And many of them that are part of that.
[00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:32.690]  This is something that I have been focused on for a long, long time.
[00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:35.070]  You know, you have a lot of different NGOs.
[00:47:35.449 --> 00:47:36.409]  And, you know, the...
[00:47:37.099 --> 00:47:38.780]  The Arabella Advisors, right?
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:39.900]  Arabella Advisors.
[00:47:40.019 --> 00:47:48.800]  I'm showing this on your show here because there is a scheme to the enemy terrain and to the enemy disposition on a battlefield.
[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:52.460]  This is the disposition of our foes, right?
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:48:00.340]  And a lot of these, their ultimate goal is what I describe as global power and a weak America.
[00:48:00.559 --> 00:48:08.760]  Well, we just won a major victory last night, and that victory has to be sealed by us continuing to fight, like I say, through this objective.
[00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:28.380]  And on this map are a series of non-governmental organizations, a number of faith-based organizations that are directly, directly involved in the illegal invasion that this country has been experiencing, even going back to Obama, but clearly during the last three and a half years under the Biden-Harris administration.
[00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:30.619]  And I'm telling you, these exist.
[00:48:30.619 --> 00:48:31.880]  We know where they are.
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:33.679]  We know exactly how they operate.
[00:48:33.719 --> 00:48:38.409]  And we need to go after every single one of these and dismantle this Formation.
[00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:40.010]  We have to dismantle a lot of this.
[00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:43.130]  I mean, this is a George Soros construction, okay?
[00:48:43.429 --> 00:48:48.610]  A construction type of organization.
[00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:53.409]  And what they've done is they've created for-profit organizations.
[00:48:53.489 --> 00:48:57.349]  And then under them, they have these non-profit organizations.
[00:48:57.349 --> 00:49:11.940]  And then they have these non-governmental organizations that tie directly into the U.S. government And get grants, I mean, to the tune of millions and millions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to be able to go and do these kinds of tasks that we're talking about right now.
[00:49:12.019 --> 00:49:13.260]  General, some of the NGOs get billions.
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:15.239]  Yeah, yeah, they do.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:21.559]  And some of them work directly for elements of the U.S. government, namely the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:25.559]  Some of them work for or underneath the USAID. So these...
[00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:27.610]  These are things...
[00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:32.769]  Alright, the full hour-long interview is on X. Just that one post of it got 15 million views.
[00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:35.869]  The other post got 5, 6, 7, 8 million apiece.
[00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:39.010]  And good job, listeners, making sure that interview went viral.
[00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:40.329]  And now, from your...
[00:49:41.739 --> 00:49:44.039]  Lips to Trump's ears, it's going down.
[00:49:44.519 --> 00:49:49.280]  But, and we went on to say, got to prosecute Mayorkas, got to prosecute them all, and we said all that.
[00:49:49.659 --> 00:50:00.780]  Now the new head, border czar, came out and said they're greenlit, we're coming after you criminally in the Biden administration for what you did with this agency.
[00:50:01.519 --> 00:50:02.920]  That is war.
[00:50:03.039 --> 00:50:04.280]  That is good.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.139]  That is cleaning house.
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:07.760]  That is draining the swamp, baby.
[00:50:08.119 --> 00:50:09.059]  This is it.
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:10.860]  Praise the Lord.
[00:50:12.659 --> 00:50:15.980]  I thank God for all of you out there because you did this.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.440]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:50:17.539 --> 00:50:21.219]  I'm going to come back with all the clips I mentioned, all the documents, all the Cash Patel information, all the Tom Homan information.
[00:50:21.219 --> 00:50:22.239]  It's a huge second hour.
[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:23.639]  I'm done ranting.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.440]  Now I'm going to go through it all.
[00:50:25.599 --> 00:50:26.940]  The rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[00:50:27.059 --> 00:50:28.099]  It's amazing, but they're dangerous.
[00:50:28.179 --> 00:50:28.800]  More dangerous than ever.
[00:50:30.059 --> 00:50:31.099]  I want to just let everybody know.
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:37.219]  We have the big Black Friday sale going on right now.

[00:51:56.659 --> 00:51:59.679]  Come up here in five minutes, but let me just say this clearly to everybody.

[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:23.920]  The Australian government's bitching and trying to ban Alex Jones and Joe Rogan and Elon Musk as we speak.
[00:52:24.039 --> 00:52:25.119]  That's coming up later in the hour.
[00:52:26.019 --> 00:52:31.440]  You're the reason the human trafficking and the sex slavery is all coming out.
[00:52:32.599 --> 00:52:34.420]  You're the reason we got Trump in.
[00:52:34.519 --> 00:52:39.119]  You're the reason we're getting Cash Patel as FBI director and Tom Homan as the border czar.
[00:52:39.219 --> 00:52:43.380]  And he's on Fox News saying, yes, we're not just going to stop the human trafficking.
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:44.880]  We're not just going to find the missing kids.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:54.780]  We're going to prosecute the grassroots smugglers, the NGOs, the UN, and the U.S. government officials that did these illegal acts.
[00:52:56.230 --> 00:53:02.570]  You have the heads of the agencies, the new heads, saying, we're coming after criminally.
[00:53:04.179 --> 00:53:06.699]  The previous administration, because it's justice.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.400]  They have to do it.
[00:53:08.699 --> 00:53:10.360]  You're aiding and abetting.
[00:53:10.519 --> 00:53:14.219]  You're just as guilty if you know it and don't fight back.
[00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:17.480]  And the globalists are going to keep doing it if we don't prosecute them.
[00:53:17.599 --> 00:53:19.619]  They're going to come back against everybody.
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:20.900]  This is cancer.
[00:53:21.139 --> 00:53:22.099]  This is war.
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:25.480]  We cannot give them any rest or quarter.
[00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:27.940]  They're never going to stop attacking us.
[00:53:28.079 --> 00:53:28.739]  They're tyrants.
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:29.639]  They're criminals.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.519]  They're arrogant scumbags.
[00:53:32.949 --> 00:53:34.210]  And we have them on the run.
[00:53:34.489 --> 00:53:44.610]  So, for another week, we're extending Black Friday sales, Cyber Monday, whatever you want to call it, the biggest sales ever.

[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.039]  That's not InfoWars.
[00:53:57.239 --> 00:54:02.619]  If the bad guys are able to get to this place, what they're trying to do right now, there's a hearing in seven days or eight days.

[00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:59.929]  We are now into our number two of this Sunday, December 1, 2024 transmission.
[00:55:59.969 --> 00:56:16.170]  We are 49 days out from the inauguration of President Trump, and Kash Patel has been selected, because it's not a nomination, the president has that power, as the new FBI director, sending shockwaves to the deep state system.
[00:56:16.289 --> 00:56:18.150]  This is a declaration of war against the globalists.
[00:56:20.519 --> 00:56:25.619]  I really tried to kill the president twice and tried to destroy this country and have committed crimes so massive it makes my head spin.
[00:56:26.099 --> 00:56:35.639]  And then you've got Tom Homan, the new border czar, saying, we're not just going after the NGOs, the UN. We're going after people in the administration that greenlit and ran all of this.
[00:56:35.739 --> 00:56:35.800]  Yeah.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.039]  How do you prosecute the human smugglers?
[00:56:38.199 --> 00:56:44.900]  How do you prosecute the NGOs for doing it when you don't prosecute the federal agency heads that did it who do not have immunity from these crimes?
[00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:50.429]  And it's in the news that Mayorkas is running around trying to get immunity right now.
[00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:52.010]  What are you going to offer for that?
[00:56:52.849 --> 00:56:54.269]  Tell us who your bosses are.
[00:56:54.369 --> 00:56:54.909]  We already know.
[00:56:55.429 --> 00:57:00.269]  The big UN NGOs, George Soros, the globalist, replacement migration.
[00:57:01.449 --> 00:57:04.010]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:57:08.349 --> 00:57:20.820]  So here is Tom Homan, clip 26. Talking about this, there's more lengthy clips up on Infowars.com and Relox Jones on X. Be sure and watch those and share those.
[00:57:21.239 --> 00:57:29.679]  I want to play clips 17 and 18 of the new incoming FBI Director Cash Patel on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein client list.
[00:57:29.679 --> 00:57:30.219]  Here it is.
[00:57:31.039 --> 00:57:33.760]  Not because of mismanagement, not because of incompetence by design.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000]  They want this open border.
[00:57:35.239 --> 00:57:43.300]  They obviously think these millions of people will be future Democratic voters, but also he overturned the Trump census rule with millions of people in sanctuary cities recounting the next census.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:44.320]  And what does that mean?
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:45.900]  More seats in house for the Dems.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:52.519]  But I tell you what, The Trump team coming to town, we're going to take control January 20th, and people are going to be held accountable.
[00:57:52.739 --> 00:57:53.920]  We're going to be very transparent.
[00:57:54.159 --> 00:57:55.059]  We're going to get behind.
[00:57:55.239 --> 00:57:58.480]  What did the United Nations have to do with this open-border crisis?
[00:57:58.699 --> 00:58:03.579]  Who in the administration, the Biden administration, opened the doors on this humanitarian crisis?
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:05.420]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[00:58:05.559 --> 00:58:09.679]  We're going to be very transparent to American people, and we're going to tell them the truth of what happened on this border.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:15.039]  Again, by design, and we're going to let the American people know who was involved, why, and hold them accountable.
[00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:18.659]  I'm not saying it's not there.
[00:58:19.039 --> 00:58:20.219]  Who are you going to get to get that?
[00:58:20.219 --> 00:58:28.980]  So who has, for instance, who is currently holding, this is way off the topic, but who has Jeffrey Epstein's...
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:29.519]  Black Book?
[00:58:29.659 --> 00:58:30.059]  Black Book!
[00:58:30.239 --> 00:58:32.659]  FBI. But who?
[00:58:33.679 --> 00:58:35.599]  That is, I mean, there's...
[00:58:35.599 --> 00:58:44.940]  Oh, that's under direct control of the director of the FBI. Just like the manifesto from the Nashville school shooting of the Catholic school.
[00:58:45.219 --> 00:58:46.440]  We still haven't seen that, right?
[00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:50.889]  It's not the Nashville police or PD saying, we don't want this out.
[00:58:51.130 --> 00:58:54.889]  The FBI airmailed into that operation and said, this is not getting out.
[00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:59.550]  Because they do that because this is another government gangster operation.
[00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:04.789]  All these local law enforcement communities get funding from the DOJ and FBI for local programs.
[00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:08.070]  And if you don't cooperate, you're not getting your million dollars for this.
[00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:10.449]  And that's a lot of money to these local districts.
[00:59:10.909 --> 00:59:11.969]  That's how they play the game.
[00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:13.789]  You know, it's the same thing with Epstein's List.
[00:59:13.889 --> 00:59:15.670]  It's like, what the hell are these Republicans doing?
[00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:20.429]  I saw you make news this morning about that.
[00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:21.429]  I gotta get to that.
[00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:24.190]  You say that the FBI has Epstein's list.
[00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:25.349]  They're sitting on it.
[00:59:25.469 --> 00:59:27.170]  That doesn't seem like something you should do.
[00:59:27.289 --> 00:59:29.010]  You're protecting the world's foremost predator.
[00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:33.989]  That seems like an evil thing to do, regardless of who may be embarrassed in the release of that list.
[00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:40.489]  Why is the FBI protecting the greatest pederast, the largest scale pederast in human history?
[00:59:40.909 --> 00:59:42.510]  Simple, because of who's on that list.
[00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:48.710]  You don't think that Bill Gates is lobbying Congress night and day to prevent the disclosure of that list?
[00:59:48.869 --> 00:59:57.769]  And why is it that the Senate, you know, and good for Senator Blackburn to try to get it out, but then Dick Turbin comes over the top and says, no, we're not going to release the names.
[00:59:57.869 --> 01:00:00.110]  I don't care about the list itself, but it released the names, right?
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.800]  What the hell are the House Republicans doing?
[01:00:03.139 --> 01:00:04.260]  They have the majority.
[01:00:04.519 --> 01:00:05.860]  You can't get the list?
[01:00:06.159 --> 01:00:13.280]  You're going to accept Dick Durbin's word or whoever that guy is as to who is on that list and who isn't and that it can and can't be released?
[01:00:13.699 --> 01:00:17.340]  Put on your big boy pants and let us know who the pedophiles are.
[01:00:17.519 --> 01:00:21.480]  We have an election coming up and we need to adjudicate this matter at the polls.
[01:00:21.659 --> 01:00:34.980]  God knows the FBI and DOJ aren't going to do anything, but how are you going to reward the FBI with a new headquarters building After their illegal surveillance on Donald Trump continues with a reauthorization of FISA, and we can't even get basic documents out.
[01:00:35.119 --> 01:00:36.920]  This is why America hates Congress.
[01:00:37.119 --> 01:00:42.639]  And this is why I'm tired of the Republican majority saying they're going to get the job done and failing.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:50.300]  Well, they've got the former deputy director totally discredited on TV. Oh God, he's so partisan.
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:51.420]  He's not independent.
[01:00:52.719 --> 01:00:59.179]  Independent, you guys are globalists that human traffic, kidnap kids, and persecute people for their legal, lawful politics.
[01:01:00.239 --> 01:01:08.219]  I mean, remember Obama had hundreds of thousands of Republican voters and people tortured by the IRS? And remember MSNBC going, well, of course we do.
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:08.960]  You deserve it.
[01:01:09.159 --> 01:01:10.500]  I mean, these people are criminals.
[01:01:11.199 --> 01:01:15.539]  Here's Cash Patel on shutting down the FBI Hoover building on day one.
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:21.340]  And then I'm going to go to another clip of Cash Patel.
[01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:28.289]  Meet your new FBI Director 19 and 20. Play all those.
[01:01:31.489 --> 01:01:34.710]  The biggest problem the FBI has had has come out of its intel shops.
[01:01:34.849 --> 01:01:36.210]  I'd break that component out of it.
[01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:42.110]  I'd shut down the FBI Hoover building on day one and reopening the next day as a museum of the deep state.
[01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:47.429]  And I'd take the 7,000 employees that work in that building and send them across America to chase down criminals.
[01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:48.230]  Go be cops.
[01:01:48.469 --> 01:01:49.070]  You're cops.
[01:01:49.269 --> 01:01:49.989]  Go be cops.
[01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:52.989]  Go chase down murderers and and drug dealers and violent offenders.
[01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:54.730]  What do you need 7,000 people there for?
[01:01:54.889 --> 01:01:57.630]  Same thing with DOJ. What are all these people doing here?
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.199]  Looking for their next government promotion.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.900]  Looking for their next fancy government title.
[01:02:01.079 --> 01:02:02.500]  Looking for their parachute out of government.
[01:02:02.619 --> 01:02:05.280]  So while you're bringing in the right people, you also have to shrink government.
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:10.639]  Anyway, the other thing that I put in the book that I recommended the boss to do hits on this.
[01:02:11.059 --> 01:02:14.340]  We need a 24-7 declassification office.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.159]  Rolling papers out 24-7.
[01:02:18.519 --> 01:02:21.940]  And not just like JFK and not just 9-11.
[01:02:22.079 --> 01:02:25.679]  You're talking the guy that's read the whole 9-11 report and those seven pages that people talk about.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:39.730]  But I believe, as like the guy who is an intel guy who believes wholeheartedly in the classified system of information, I believe that it has been over-abused by these corrupt officials in government to hide the truth and enact more corrupt activities.
[01:02:39.889 --> 01:02:44.289]  So what I told the boss was like, I don't care what you call it, truth and reconciliation, whatever, come up with a better name.
[01:02:44.989 --> 01:02:48.510]  But every agency and department literally submits all of their documentation.
[01:02:50.679 --> 01:02:52.260]  I believe you could get half out.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:52.800]  Half.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.139]  I still think the other half needs to remain classified.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:58.579]  I'll always argue that it does serve a purpose.
[01:02:59.059 --> 01:03:01.659]  Like you're seeing in these documents in the Jack Smith case.
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.519]  They're just redacting stuff that they lied about.
[01:03:03.699 --> 01:03:04.659]  That they broke the law.
[01:03:05.159 --> 01:03:06.219]  It's used to protect themselves.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:13.269]  And it's a public document in a federal court, which is a document for the people of the United States And we can have you run that office.
[01:03:13.409 --> 01:03:15.210]  You can come in and just be like, hey, I want all the Saudi documents.
[01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:16.070]  I'll gladly do that.
[01:03:16.329 --> 01:03:17.190]  I'd be so happy.
[01:03:17.429 --> 01:03:20.530]  So Luke will be the press secretary for the Libertarian Party.
[01:03:20.809 --> 01:03:22.030]  The declassifying documentary.
[01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:23.050]  The viceroy of declassification.
[01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:23.530]  Absolutely.
[01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:24.070]  I like that.
[01:03:24.449 --> 01:03:24.909]  I'm in.
[01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:26.429]  Where do I sign up?
[01:03:26.929 --> 01:03:29.530]  But I think that's how you earn the respect.
[01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:31.630]  Like you said, Donald Trump started talking about these things.
[01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:33.789]  Then we started putting these documents out there.
[01:03:33.929 --> 01:03:42.269]  And remember when I ran Russiagate, right, they came after me and said, if you put out the Nunes memo and you put this out that you wrote, our enemies and our allies are going to get murdered.
[01:03:42.449 --> 01:03:43.030]  No one died.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:54.300]  Donald Trump just nominated Cash Patel to be the next director of the FBI. Y'all, it's about to go down.
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:57.199]  Cash Patel is about to clean house.
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.139]  What you gonna do?
[01:04:00.699 --> 01:04:03.800]  What you gonna do, bad boys, bad boys?
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.019]  What you gonna do?
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.719]  Cash Patel is coming for you.
[01:04:19.929 --> 01:04:21.690]  I don't even know the lyrics.
[01:04:26.349 --> 01:04:36.070]  Y'all, this is about to be the best administration in the history of America.
[01:04:36.489 --> 01:04:37.889]  It is going down.
[01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:40.110]  Trump is not playing.
[01:04:41.059 --> 01:04:42.400]  He ain't coming to play.
[01:04:45.239 --> 01:04:52.199]  Y'all, I am so excited for the future of America.
[01:04:56.119 --> 01:04:57.219]  Trump coming for you.
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:04:59.860]  Cash Patel coming for you.
[01:05:01.059 --> 01:05:02.519]  Pam Bondi coming for you, too.
[01:05:07.259 --> 01:05:13.320]  You know, and look, I'm not the type of guy that likes to sit here and spike footballs in the end zone and stuff, because we're up against very dangerous enemies.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:19.440]  But the public has been demoralized, attacked, demonized, lied to, and people deserve to celebrate.
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:29.000]  But I'm really going to celebrate when these arrogant, master criminal supervillains start getting put in prison.
[01:05:30.909 --> 01:05:35.429]  I mean, we got really evil people running this country.
[01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:48.010]  And again, the boldness of the things they've done, the boldness of the things that they have gotten away with.
[01:05:48.530 --> 01:06:00.820]  And I just ask myself, if Donald Trump is a good person, if Tom Homan is a good person, if any of these people are good, The new Attorney General.
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:03.820]  Bondi.
[01:06:05.039 --> 01:06:10.059]  If they've got any soul, you've got to say, we're going to find the kids.
[01:06:10.199 --> 01:06:16.460]  I mean, when it's a U.S. citizen and the media decides to cover it, you'll hear about a missing kid for years.
[01:06:16.619 --> 01:06:23.219]  But then you realize there's massive tens of thousands every year come up missing.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:24.840]  And they go, well, most of those are runaways.
[01:06:25.539 --> 01:06:27.440]  Okay, let's say 70, 80% are.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:35.800]  Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands are kidnapped and raped and in some cases, many cases, murdered.
[01:06:36.719 --> 01:06:42.760]  And the cases are so brutal, when you get into crime statistics, you find out about these cases, you're like, where did I not hear about this one?
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.119]  Why did I not hear about that one?
[01:06:44.239 --> 01:06:45.659]  In your neighborhood, in your town.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.260]  It is massive.
[01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:54.170]  So the media will pick a few cases and make a big deal about that and act like they're covering it, but they're not reporting to people how big this is.
[01:06:54.230 --> 01:07:12.050]  Then you find out the biggest perpetrators of all of this is the UN and its NGOs and the central governments of Europe and The United States,
[01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:17.150]  Canada, the UK. I mean, look, if you've been hiding under a rock, you don't know this, but the listeners all know this.
[01:07:17.269 --> 01:07:22.409]  But for new listeners, new viewers, have you ever researched the UK and child sex slavery and pedophiles?
[01:07:22.530 --> 01:07:23.590]  It runs the government.
[01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:27.329]  It runs MI6. I mean, this is a cult.
[01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:31.090]  And you see them with the transgenderism and all this.
[01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:33.130]  They're coming for our children.
[01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:37.329]  Their religion is destroying our children's innocence.
[01:07:37.489 --> 01:07:37.889]  Right?
[01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:50.329]  And I know for the average person, it's hard to believe all this is going on.
[01:07:50.429 --> 01:07:51.190]  But it is.
[01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:54.630]  All right.
[01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:59.429]  I got a bunch of other news I'm going to hit here.
[01:07:59.989 --> 01:08:01.190]  And there is a lot of it.
[01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:07.269]  But I just spent the first hour and 18 minutes on this subject.
[01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:08.909]  Trump is really delivering.
[01:08:10.289 --> 01:08:10.690]  And...
[01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.010]  I'm glad he's not hiding it from them.
[01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:17.109]  Because look, they got all their phones tapped.
[01:08:18.109 --> 01:08:20.270]  They got globalist operatives in the whole system.
[01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:22.750]  But we're watching them too.
[01:08:23.609 --> 01:08:25.890]  We're fully aware of their MO and how they operate.
[01:08:26.130 --> 01:08:29.050]  So I just say get the whole thing out in the open.
[01:08:30.029 --> 01:08:36.869]  And if we're strong and we're not intimidated and we tell the truth, the globalists are never going to get away with any of this.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.260]  They are the villains.
[01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:41.319]  They are the bad guys.
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:47.359]  They are the ones selling dystopia as if it's the best thing since mother's milk and sliced bread.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.539]  And the dog doesn't hunt.
[01:08:51.819 --> 01:08:58.079]  So, very, very exciting time to be alive right now.
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.039]  All right.
[01:09:03.989 --> 01:09:04.829]  I'm going to go home now.
[01:09:05.109 --> 01:09:06.189]  I can't do the show anymore.
[01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:06.670]  I've got to go.
[01:09:08.409 --> 01:09:09.970]  We'll go to rebroadcast for a while.
[01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:11.350]  Chase is going to do his show.
[01:09:14.890 --> 01:09:16.630]  I am not going to blow up on air.
[01:09:16.829 --> 01:09:19.149]  So I've told everybody when I get to this point, I'm just going to leave.
[01:09:20.449 --> 01:09:21.430]  So I appreciate everybody.
[01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:25.029]  I'll try to come in tomorrow and do the show at 11 a.m.
[01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:26.590]  Central and get to all this other important news.
[01:09:26.670 --> 01:09:30.010]  It was all extremely vital, all extremely important, but I can't do it.
[01:09:30.310 --> 01:09:31.369]  So that's just where I'm at.
[01:09:31.569 --> 01:09:32.770]  Just cannot do it anymore.
[01:09:33.369 --> 01:09:35.149]  Cannot, cannot, cannot.
[01:09:36.210 --> 01:09:36.569]  So.
[01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:45.689]  That's where I was Friday.
[01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:47.329]  I just may have to go for a few weeks.
[01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:49.310]  I just, no, I'm leaving.
[01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:49.649]  It's okay.
[01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:51.710]  So, um, I love everybody.
[01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:52.250]  I just gotta go.
[01:09:53.050 --> 01:09:57.550]  Um, so, I mean, I'm glad all this other stuff's happening.
[01:09:57.689 --> 01:09:58.550]  I'm glad this is going on.
[01:09:58.649 --> 01:09:58.930]  It's great.
[01:10:00.970 --> 01:10:15.689]  But, you know, I just get loaded with information and, uh, And I just get where I can't look at it anymore.
[01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:18.949]  Even if good news is happening, I just can't do this anymore.
[01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:25.050]  I can't look at Obama or George Clooney.
[01:10:26.409 --> 01:10:31.529]  I can't look at these Australian officials wanting to arrest Americans for their free speech.
[01:10:32.649 --> 01:10:36.989]  I can't look at them cutting these little girls' breasts off and calling it trendy.
[01:10:38.189 --> 01:10:39.569]  You got Keira Starmer.
[01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:45.859]  Coming out and just totally flipping the script and saying, oh, it's the right wing that wants the open borders.
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:47.979]  I mean, talk about desperate gaslighting.
[01:11:10.170 --> 01:11:10.869]  I don't know anymore.
[01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:14.250]  I just hit a wall.
[01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:25.890]  I probably prepare for these shows too much.
[01:11:27.689 --> 01:11:28.649]  Because that's another thing.
[01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:30.350]  It's like I can't even do any of this justice.
[01:11:30.569 --> 01:11:37.310]  I could talk about this attack on free speech stack that's just like probably ten videos and a bunch of articles for like eight hours.
[01:11:41.439 --> 01:11:47.760]  And then I've got major British government study confirming everyone having the heart attacks.
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:49.020]  Myocarditis took the shot.
[01:11:49.359 --> 01:11:52.119]  It's 100% the shot, and it's designed to make you have a heart attack.
[01:11:52.479 --> 01:11:53.279]  I mean, just come on.
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:57.279]  Why aren't these people at the ends of ropes years ago?
[01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:00.619]  I mean, why do I have to beg people to care about this?
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:01.159]  Seriously.
[01:12:02.409 --> 01:12:03.470]  It's television, man.
[01:12:03.609 --> 01:12:07.670]  People have been raised from birth just in their crap-filled diapers watching television.
[01:12:07.909 --> 01:12:10.029]  And everything, everybody is just entertainment.
[01:12:10.449 --> 01:12:12.829]  Everything is a damn entertainment.
[01:12:13.109 --> 01:12:14.329]  It's not entertainment.
[01:12:14.609 --> 01:12:17.229]  We're being murdered by a psychotic death cult.
[01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:18.449]  And I'm sick of it.
[01:12:19.229 --> 01:12:21.890]  And these people cannot be arrested soon enough.
[01:12:28.369 --> 01:12:29.149]  I mean, look at this.
[01:12:29.609 --> 01:12:30.310]  New report.
[01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:34.510]  Liberal women are sterilizing themselves in response to truth election.
[01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:36.130]  Truth election.
[01:12:36.289 --> 01:12:36.970]  I just had a Freudian slip.
[01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:37.649]  Trump election.
[01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:39.470]  It is the truth election.
[01:12:42.029 --> 01:12:43.390]  Oh, my God.
[01:12:46.069 --> 01:12:54.890]  I also really wanted that Trump statement where he talked about going to war with Brex.
[01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:56.010]  I posted up one act.
[01:12:56.069 --> 01:12:57.609]  I thought I'd send it.
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:00.600]  That was kind of a big story, too.
[01:13:00.979 --> 01:13:02.180]  Let's cover it maybe tomorrow.
[01:13:14.159 --> 01:13:17.479]  I, uh...
[01:13:17.479 --> 01:13:18.060]  I don't know.
[01:13:25.779 --> 01:13:26.859]  So, uh...
[01:13:27.829 --> 01:13:28.689]  This is the new show now.
[01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:29.729]  That's what I'm going to do now on the show.
[01:13:30.729 --> 01:13:31.130]  Just sit here.
[01:13:31.229 --> 01:13:31.829]  Oh, yeah, great.
[01:13:33.949 --> 01:13:46.430]  I got all the Western countries from Asia, the United States, total population collapse, live expectancy plunging, sperm counting plunging, one in, you know, 10 people having autism for one in 50,000.
[01:13:46.949 --> 01:13:47.869]  I got it all right here.
[01:13:47.989 --> 01:13:48.989]  They're murdering everybody right now.
[01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:49.890]  So does he like it?
[01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:51.010]  Is it fun?
[01:13:52.329 --> 01:13:53.569]  Everybody think it's cool?
[01:13:54.970 --> 01:13:55.729]  Everybody like it?
[01:13:57.279 --> 01:14:00.520]  Go to the D.R. Jones Naturals clip if you got that and we'll see what happens.
[01:14:00.699 --> 01:14:02.100]  I'm gonna see if I can get my...
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:07.000]  I'm gonna see if I can get my Trump Bricks statement maybe here.
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:08.220]  All right, here it is.
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:16.020]  My dad is chemistry background, also a retired doctor, but he came in to help me run my supplement division 13 years ago.
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:17.800]  The deep state sued the hell out of him.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.239]  We're going to our guest in a moment, but I gotta do this.
[01:14:19.319 --> 01:14:19.680]  Thank you, sir.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.819]  They basically almost destroyed my parents.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:30.380]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family that my dad was at the edge of bankruptcy himself with all the lawsuits the Democrats filed.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.380]  By the way, they said in court that their attorney's fees are 316 million yesterday.
[01:14:34.739 --> 01:14:37.340]  They filed before they've spent 80 million suing me.
[01:14:37.609 --> 01:14:39.170]  We spent $16 million fighting them.
[01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:41.029]  My dad spent $2 million fighting them.
[01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:42.189]  And we're finally winning.
[01:14:42.409 --> 01:14:50.270]  Not only does my dad's supplement company, drjonesnaturals.com, have some of the best supplements, it is a personal request I ask you to support him.
[01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:53.729]  Because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[01:14:53.829 --> 01:14:56.369]  He was giving everything to InfoWars.
[01:14:56.470 --> 01:15:02.789]  And then personally going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me.
[01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:03.890]  Because that's how dads are.
[01:15:04.090 --> 01:15:05.409]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:10.430]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office.
[01:15:10.609 --> 01:15:11.670]  And I got pissed.
[01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:19.409]  So it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:21.130]  The supplements are there.
[01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:21.909]  They're great.
[01:15:22.069 --> 01:15:23.250]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[01:15:23.329 --> 01:15:24.210]  He's put everything into it.
[01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:24.630]  He has.
[01:15:24.710 --> 01:15:25.289]  They're incredible.
[01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:35.250]  I've given so much to this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything, But I don't want to belabor this.
[01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:36.529]  We have important topics to cover.
[01:15:37.369 --> 01:15:38.609]  Please support us.
[01:15:38.829 --> 01:15:40.829]  Go to drjonesdadgrills.com.
[01:15:40.909 --> 01:15:41.630]  There's a new sale.

[01:15:58.729 --> 01:15:59.489]  A big sale.
[01:15:59.649 --> 01:16:06.510]  And my dad literally took a loan last week to be able to buy the product that's coming in finally.
[01:16:06.829 --> 01:16:09.670]  Next week, turbo force, things like that that are popular.
[01:16:09.850 --> 01:16:12.369]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:16.869]  And the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down.
[01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:18.529]  My dad won't stop fighting.
[01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:19.289]  He's a fighter.
[01:16:19.409 --> 01:16:20.250]  Hell, he's my dad.
[01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:21.369]  I think I'm a fighter.
[01:16:21.630 --> 01:16:23.010]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:31.210]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[01:16:31.369 --> 01:16:34.069]  But this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:34.170 --> 01:16:35.149]  It's about my parents.
[01:16:35.710 --> 01:16:41.250]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's what the enemy targeted them.
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:44.739]  Please support the info war today.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.840]  Support my mother and my father.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.840]  I'm asking you personally for you to do it now.
[01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:52.720]  And at 5% of the millions watching, we go do it.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:54.560]  All our problems will be over in one minute.
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:17:00.199]  But it's less than one-half, one percent to ever buy anything from drjonesnagros.com, thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:03.840]  And for those that do support, thank you for keeping us in the fight for our futures.
[01:17:04.239 --> 01:17:07.520]  So, thealexjonesstore.com, drjonesnagros.com.
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.140]  I'm going to shut up at the balance of this hour.
[01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:14.170]  Alright, here's what I'm going to do.
[01:17:21.449 --> 01:17:26.569]  I'm going to try to do the rest of the show.
[01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:29.569]  At least the next couple of segments.
[01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:31.109]  And then Chase is coming in here.
[01:17:32.369 --> 01:17:38.529]  The big thing is, you know, I'm just fed up, man.
[01:17:38.970 --> 01:17:40.029]  I'm just sick of these people.
[01:17:41.970 --> 01:17:43.770]  And maybe I should just take a vacation.
[01:17:45.630 --> 01:17:49.210]  Because all I do is look at these maggots all day long.
[01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:51.970]  They're just scum and they think they're better than us.
[01:17:52.029 --> 01:17:54.149]  They get away with all these crimes and they love it.
[01:17:54.829 --> 01:17:56.189]  I just can't wait.
[01:17:57.010 --> 01:17:58.189]  I can't wait.
[01:17:58.569 --> 01:17:59.569]  They're destroyed.
[01:18:00.829 --> 01:18:02.529]  See, I'm gonna really get mean on there.
[01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:03.449]  That's why I probably need to leave.
[01:18:05.899 --> 01:18:08.020]  Look, I know you're just as pissed off as I am.
[01:18:08.479 --> 01:18:11.960]  We've been through a long war with these demons.
[01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:18.060]  And a lot of really insanely good things are happening.
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:24.340]  And I'm going to do my best job here in the last 30 minutes of this show to cover as much news as I can.
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:29.460]  And then I'm going to hand the baton to Chase Geisers and come in here and do a great job along with the rest of the crew.
[01:18:30.239 --> 01:18:31.260]  I really appreciate.
[01:18:32.819 --> 01:18:33.579]  I, uh...
[01:18:34.939 --> 01:18:37.300]  I understand why people can't face all this.
[01:18:38.899 --> 01:18:41.100]  But I'm kind of the other extreme.
[01:18:41.239 --> 01:18:41.920]  This is all I do.
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:45.960]  And I know these people up one side and down the other.
[01:18:46.119 --> 01:18:47.819]  I know every one of their damn plans.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.460]  I know just how to stop them.
[01:18:49.819 --> 01:18:51.319]  And I'm sick of them.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.300]  I want them off of me.
[01:18:54.399 --> 01:18:55.380]  I want them off of you.
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:01.260]  And we're going to do it.
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:02.939]  So...
[01:19:05.399 --> 01:19:07.640]  We're kind of in the last mile here of the marathon, though.
[01:19:09.199 --> 01:19:18.539]  We've just got to be wise as serpents and peaceful as doves and just stay on target and get it done.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:22.279]  I'm going to get into Trump on bricks here in a moment.
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:23.300]  This is really important.
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:30.119]  But I want to show you something here that's really illustrative of the establishment.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:34.939]  And Their mindset.
[01:19:36.399 --> 01:19:37.239]  Okay.
[01:19:38.939 --> 01:19:41.239]  Here's the New York Times headline.
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:43.039]  Listen to this.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.260]  This came out Friday.
[01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:49.079]  Republicans built an ecosystem of influencers.
[01:19:55.439 --> 01:19:58.560]  Some Democrats want one too.
[01:20:01.079 --> 01:20:02.479]  Like a soul?
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:14.560]  Now, my main frustration is I could do two hours on this one article.
[01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:17.380]  I mean, this tells you everything.
[01:20:17.859 --> 01:20:19.800]  And there's a lot of facets to it.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:29.479]  A, the people putting this out know that what they're saying here isn't true.
[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:33.739]  On so many levels.
[01:20:35.359 --> 01:20:37.300]  And Elon Musk made the point.
[01:20:38.619 --> 01:20:42.220]  Responding to Wall Street, Mav, this is so wrong.
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:47.140]  The Republicans did not build an ecosystem of influencers.
[01:20:47.539 --> 01:20:57.800]  The conservative ecosystem of large-account influencers happened organically, despite the Republican establishment never giving its support or paying any attention.
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:03.079]  And Elon Musk said, true, the New York Times is pure propaganda.
[01:21:05.659 --> 01:21:07.899]  Now, here's the actual...
[01:21:18.909 --> 01:21:19.649]  Article.
[01:21:20.909 --> 01:21:23.289]  Republicans built an ecosystem of influencers.
[01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:25.829]  Some Democrats want one too.
[01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:42.630]  Democrats were badly outflanked online in the election and progressive influencers are now trying to create networks to be a left-wing answer to Turning Point USA. Oh my God.
[01:21:47.479 --> 01:22:00.579]  Barron Trump, and it's true because I've asked around, literally in the last six months of the campaign convinced his dad by showing him graphs and numbers that are publicly available of analytics and statistics.
[01:22:03.159 --> 01:22:11.520]  That he needed to stop caring about Fox News and MSNBC and CNN. And then Fox's biggest shows had 4 million.
[01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:13.739]  CNN's biggest, a million.
[01:22:14.619 --> 01:22:16.239]  MSNBC's biggest, a million and a half.
[01:22:16.659 --> 01:22:23.060]  When medium-sized podcasts have hundreds of thousands, big ones, tens of millions.
[01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:27.279]  And when Trump goes on them, hundreds of millions.
[01:22:27.479 --> 01:22:31.199]  Or when he went on Musk, space is a billion.
[01:22:33.170 --> 01:22:36.090]  Now you talk about leading a horse to water and trying to get it to drink.
[01:22:38.409 --> 01:22:41.670]  This is emblematic of the old Republican establishment.
[01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:54.210]  Now Trump's not really part of that, but he's still almost 80 years old and is habituated to still thinking cable news is important.
[01:22:56.029 --> 01:23:06.510]  Cable news is only important Because Republicans, the good ones, continue to act like it has any power and it gives it relevancy.
[01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:22.310]  So when they're constantly making crap up, Trump would respond to them and keep him off of his message by constantly responding to attacks and garbage that didn't make a difference with the voters because they knew it was a load of horseshit.
[01:23:23.770 --> 01:23:26.569]  Now, that's only one layer of this.
[01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:38.789]  The other layers, and there's a lot of them, one of the other big ones is, the Republicans have a group of influencers?
[01:23:40.649 --> 01:23:43.310]  And now the Democrats want one too.
[01:23:43.869 --> 01:23:54.189]  Implying the Democrats didn't have all the corporate media and Facebook and Instagram and Google and YouTube and Apple and every other damn thing.
[01:23:54.369 --> 01:24:05.270]  Force feeding establishment, BlackRock, NGO, New World Order, Agenda 2030, WEF bullcrap.
[01:24:06.170 --> 01:24:07.029]  And...
[01:24:08.689 --> 01:24:25.630]  Disney and all the programs and Star Wars and the Netflix and movies like Civil War and leaving forever, leaving the world forever, on and on and on and on.
[01:24:25.729 --> 01:24:34.949]  And the colleges and the private schools and the public schools and the corporate DEI and the brainwashing and the political correctness.
[01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:36.590]  I mean, we're just bathing in it.
[01:24:36.729 --> 01:24:37.949]  We're drowning in it.
[01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:44.090]  And they're like, oh, we want one too.
[01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:55.569]  A, the Republican Party isn't even smart enough to try to interface with the popular host.
[01:24:57.689 --> 01:25:04.529]  And then the popular hosts are not Republicans and they're not even what you call conservatives.
[01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:06.689]  They are informed.
[01:25:06.930 --> 01:25:09.770]  They are populist.
[01:25:09.930 --> 01:25:11.930]  They are libertarian.
[01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:13.829]  They are Christian.
[01:25:14.170 --> 01:25:16.029]  They are American firsters.
[01:25:16.210 --> 01:25:17.609]  They are capitalist.
[01:25:17.989 --> 01:25:19.590]  They are realist.
[01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:21.510]  They are common censers.
[01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:24.149]  They are logical people.
[01:25:25.170 --> 01:25:43.039]  And the left and the globalist and the Democratic Party and their cohorts around the world The WEF, BlackRock, New World Order cult are wildly deceptive,
[01:25:43.359 --> 01:26:05.149]  wildly predatory, insanely evil, and what they're promoting is dystopic nightmare sci-fi hellscape And so it's not Republicans.
[01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:08.609]  It's humanity.
[01:26:08.989 --> 01:26:12.529]  It's team humanity saying no to all of this.
[01:26:15.090 --> 01:26:30.149]  What the Democrats have is hundreds of thousands of influencers on X, on YouTube, on Instagram, on Facebook, on and on and on, Reddit, LinkedIn.
[01:26:30.449 --> 01:26:34.510]  I mean, there's just thousands of these outlets that just shovel feces in our faces.
[01:26:36.289 --> 01:26:48.869]  And no matter what show you watch or what program on MSNBC or The Young Turds, it is the same talking points, the same garbage, the same lies, the same deception.
[01:26:49.289 --> 01:26:58.229]  That's why you're not popular, because what you're pushing as anti-human is classic totalitarianism with a high-tech upgrade.
[01:27:02.519 --> 01:27:09.659]  And despite all the force-feeding, the audiences of all these outlets have shrunk down to almost nothing.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:33.039]  And collectively, the only power they have left is just pure hoaxes, pure lies, getting us into fights with them to stay relevant and tie us up in knots, responding to their BS. So,
[01:27:33.039 --> 01:27:44.800]  you know, they said in a bunch of establishment publications right before the election, they said, you know, if we can't win this, this will mean we're discredited and don't have the power anymore and that we're dead.
[01:27:45.739 --> 01:27:47.819]  You were dead a long time ago.
[01:27:47.819 --> 01:27:51.039]  You were just stealing elections, you scum, and you know it.
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:58.500]  The damn landslide was so big, probably 75% of voters, that you couldn't override it because of the simple mathematics.
[01:28:06.010 --> 01:28:08.109]  So, they already know this.
[01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:10.989]  Who doesn't know it is their constituency.
[01:28:11.829 --> 01:28:15.289]  And that's where I move to this next report.
[01:28:18.109 --> 01:28:19.789]  This is also in Newsweek.
[01:28:20.010 --> 01:28:20.630]  This is real.
[01:28:20.829 --> 01:28:21.729]  This is really happening.
[01:28:22.329 --> 01:28:23.270]  Here's Gateway Pundit.
[01:28:24.789 --> 01:28:25.850]  New report.
[01:28:26.869 --> 01:28:33.890]  Liberal women are sterilizing themselves in response to Trump election because they say Trump's coming for their uterus, so you cut it out yourself.
[01:28:36.159 --> 01:28:41.720]  You cut out your fallopian tubes, and you read the women they quote in here, and they're shaving their heads and everything else.
[01:28:41.779 --> 01:28:43.060]  They go take their 10th booster.
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:52.699]  This is what cults do in their final stage, is they start self-harming and killing themselves.
[01:28:52.939 --> 01:28:57.840]  Here's two young girls who had their breasts cut off.
[01:28:58.279 --> 01:28:59.640]  This isn't some horror movie.
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:00.399]  This is the real world.
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:02.920]  They go against their humanity, pink hair, blue hair.
[01:29:04.869 --> 01:29:05.350]  It's a cult.
[01:29:05.649 --> 01:29:06.949]  They cut their breasts off.
[01:29:07.369 --> 01:29:08.510]  They'll show everybody.
[01:29:10.770 --> 01:29:16.090]  You know, just a few years ago, you cut yourself, they send you to a mental institution.
[01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:18.510]  But now, oh, the doctors will do it for you.
[01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:19.890]  Yeah, you think you're in a cult?
[01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:26.270]  Rob Reiner's so upset about Trump winning, he said he checked himself into a lunatic asylum.
[01:29:36.119 --> 01:29:40.439]  See, they've been in the scam so long and invested in it so much, their whole identity's in it.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:41.760]  They're supposed to be the elite.
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:42.800]  They're supposed to be in power.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.020]  They're the ones that follow the orders.
[01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:46.020]  They take the serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[01:29:46.119 --> 01:29:47.000]  They take the antidepressants.
[01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:48.060]  They take the 10th booster.
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:49.899]  They make their hair purple.
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:52.119]  They hate America.
[01:29:52.119 --> 01:29:52.920]  They hate men.
[01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:53.899]  They hate their family.
[01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:55.539]  But they love BlackRock.
[01:29:55.659 --> 01:29:56.539]  They love Bill Gates.
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:57.439]  They love Pfizer.
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:00.699]  They love MSNBC. They love the Democratic Party.
[01:30:01.939 --> 01:30:03.119]  They love lies.
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:05.300]  And now it's all caving in on them.
[01:30:05.479 --> 01:30:09.600]  And then they're, well, I'll just sterilize myself because I won't be able to get an abortion.
[01:30:09.859 --> 01:30:11.880]  There have been more abortions since Roe v.
[01:30:11.979 --> 01:30:13.699]  Wade got overturned, statistically.
[01:30:15.739 --> 01:30:19.680]  There'll still be states where you can go get it done, but that's the federalist system.
[01:30:19.819 --> 01:30:21.560]  Some states are going to say, we don't do that here.
[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:23.140]  No one's coming for you.
[01:30:23.239 --> 01:30:24.600]  No one's trying to enslave you.
[01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:34.260]  Everyone is so upset by the death cult and by children's body parts being sold, and you guys calling it a wonderful sacrament that it's being rejected, and it should be.
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:42.020]  California legislature passes bill reducing penalties for oral and anal sex with willing children.
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:53.020]  California Attorney General Rob Boda wants holiday shoppers to spy on businesses and report stores without gender-neutral kids sections.
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.159]  Yeah, can't let boys and girls be boys and girls.
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:56.779]  What a cult.
[01:30:57.359 --> 01:31:00.680]  Fines of $150 for the first offense, $500 for the repeats.
[01:31:01.039 --> 01:31:06.140]  California thieves get a pass, but businesses are punished for not being woke enough.
[01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:06.960]  Woke enough?
[01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:09.560]  They are destroying...
[01:31:11.130 --> 01:31:14.710]  The family, the biological system of mammals.
[01:31:16.529 --> 01:31:25.050]  All over the U.S. and Europe, they're not saying ladies and gentlemen at the beginning of sports games or music events because ladies and gentlemen is hurtful.
[01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:27.069]  You're under attack.
[01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:33.029]  This was produced and created to destabilize civilization.
[01:31:33.029 --> 01:31:36.149]  It's not whacked out liberals making a mistake.
[01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:38.029]  They know what they're doing.
[01:31:40.289 --> 01:31:41.729]  The cult members don't, though.
[01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:44.750]  So how are they responding?
[01:31:45.569 --> 01:31:47.810]  Let's get the Keir Starmer clip ready, please.
[01:31:48.029 --> 01:31:49.470]  Then I'll play the Australia clip.
[01:31:50.210 --> 01:31:54.029]  Keir Starmer, the British Prime Minister, came out Friday.
[01:31:56.850 --> 01:32:00.949]  And he said, it's the conservatives that wanted open borders.
[01:32:01.010 --> 01:32:02.470]  It's the Brexit people.
[01:32:02.630 --> 01:32:03.810]  It's Nigel Farage.
[01:32:06.009 --> 01:32:10.390]  One England, you know, one country means the whole world.
[01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.909]  No, no, no.
[01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:17.590]  It's the left and the UN and the EU that have the migrant quotas.
[01:32:17.789 --> 01:32:20.989]  And yeah, are the Tories leftist in disguise?
[01:32:20.989 --> 01:32:23.250]  Yeah, but it wasn't the Brexit movement.
[01:32:24.829 --> 01:32:32.310]  Yeah, Boris Johnson flipped on Nigel Farage and betrayed them, but Farage exposed him.
[01:32:32.409 --> 01:32:39.439]  But to say that it's the right-wingers, That did this is gaslighting.
[01:32:39.579 --> 01:32:49.800]  And remember what Keir Starmer just a few months ago with the Islamists rioting and raping and killing and people fought back and he called them all terrorists and he wants Elon Musk arrested and Elon Musk to come testify in their parliament.
[01:32:50.539 --> 01:32:56.560]  And now he does a 180 and Keir Starmer comes out and says, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:57.880]  It's not labor.
[01:32:59.439 --> 01:33:00.460]  It's the conservatives.
[01:33:01.199 --> 01:33:10.239]  And yeah, they've been a part of it as well, but not the Brexit movement, not UKIP before that, or the new party that's surging, led by Nigel Farage.
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:15.420]  And yeah, you get traitors, just like we have traded Republicans, that don't deliver what they're supposed to, that we remove them.
[01:33:16.319 --> 01:33:19.939]  And yeah, they stole an election four years ago, so we had such a landslide, we overrode that.
[01:33:20.119 --> 01:33:20.899]  It's called a fight.
[01:33:21.039 --> 01:33:21.859]  It's called a struggle.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.340]  So, this is total desperation.
[01:33:33.619 --> 01:33:35.659]  You know, he only won by 17, 18 points.
[01:33:36.119 --> 01:33:37.579]  You go, wait a minute, how did that happen?
[01:33:38.079 --> 01:33:39.180]  Parliamentary manipulation.
[01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:41.699]  Labor's been in power the most over the years.
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:49.140]  They wrote the rules that for their seats in parliament, they're counted many times more than other seats.
[01:33:49.939 --> 01:33:51.579]  It's a seniority system.
[01:33:51.939 --> 01:34:03.560]  So even though his party got less than 20% of the vote, and other parties got more, They have seniority, so he's in there.
[01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:11.220]  And now he knows there's a new election being formed, because they can force that with petitions, record level signed.
[01:34:11.439 --> 01:34:14.439]  And so now he's like, oh, no, [...] no.
[01:34:14.739 --> 01:34:15.739]  I'm going to fix it.
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:18.220]  We're the party that wants border control.
[01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:22.020]  Kind of like Harris said, I'm the border czar, open borders, everybody's got to be legalized.
[01:34:22.119 --> 01:34:24.239]  Then, I was never the border czar.
[01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:26.710]  Six months ago, and then a few months before the election.
[01:34:26.850 --> 01:34:28.029]  I was the border czar!
[01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:29.250]  I built the wall!
[01:34:29.409 --> 01:34:31.250]  As if you have no memory!
[01:34:37.489 --> 01:34:38.729]  Here's Keira Starmer.
[01:34:40.090 --> 01:34:44.130]  What the British people are owed is an explanation.
[01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:50.210]  Because a failure on this scale isn't just bad luck.
[01:34:50.770 --> 01:34:54.310]  It isn't a global trend or taking your eye off the ball.
[01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:57.859]  No, this is a different order of failure.
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:02.739]  This happened by design, not accident.
[01:35:03.539 --> 01:35:08.340]  Policies were reformed, deliberately, to liberalise immigration.
[01:35:09.079 --> 01:35:17.239]  Brexit was used for that purpose, to turn Britain into a one-nation experiment in open borders.
[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:19.279]  Global Britain.
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:21.399]  Remember that slogan?
[01:35:22.119 --> 01:35:23.680]  That is what they meant.
[01:35:24.369 --> 01:35:29.470]  A policy with no support, of which they then pretended wasn't happening.
[01:35:33.989 --> 01:35:42.470]  No, saying that a country's one nation means we're not in the EU with the EU dictating open borders.
[01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:53.090]  And then Boris Johnson betrayed all that and continued it, and now it's gotten way worse under the last two governments, including...
[01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:58.520]  The Tories, the mainline fake conservatives, just like our neocons, our rhinos.
[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:04.939]  And then now labor gets in and is flooding it at record levels.
[01:36:05.859 --> 01:36:08.060]  And now flip-flops and says they're not.
[01:36:08.239 --> 01:36:10.960]  I mean, these people are incredible.
[01:36:11.479 --> 01:36:13.340]  Meanwhile, and there's so many examples of this.
[01:36:14.399 --> 01:36:16.460]  Walmart getting rid of DEI, all of it.
[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:31.859]  Now Apple, and I don't have time to run it, but I'll run it tomorrow, has this Christmas ad for iPads and stuff that's all about family and mothers and fathers and little girls and little boys, brothers and sisters, and beautiful, and how the best thing in the world's families.
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:34.180]  You would never see this until now.
[01:36:34.739 --> 01:36:36.520]  And now suddenly it's not just them.
[01:36:36.939 --> 01:36:48.100]  It's all the big, because the corporate pushed their attack, pushed their thing to break our will, and then once we got mad and woke up, they back away, and they're going to try to hide in the shadows until we fall back asleep.
[01:36:49.590 --> 01:36:50.670]  And that's all that's happening.
[01:36:52.050 --> 01:37:07.029]  But Australia, let's demonize myself and countless other people for free speech, has now come out and blamed Joe Rogan for the unpopularity of their government and their poison shots and their lockdowns.
[01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:09.409]  And Joe was a big part of that, but...
[01:37:11.050 --> 01:37:12.109]  What about the Australian people?
[01:37:12.210 --> 01:37:13.270]  What about all the other shows?
[01:37:13.409 --> 01:37:14.029]  What about all the...
[01:37:14.029 --> 01:37:16.010]  But they love to pick one person.
[01:37:16.069 --> 01:37:17.250]  Kind of like I was picked eight years ago.
[01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:19.869]  Oh, all this populism is Alex Jones.
[01:37:20.090 --> 01:37:21.409]  Everything's happening because of him.
[01:37:21.569 --> 01:37:24.329]  If we just get him off the air, that'll stop it all.
[01:37:25.729 --> 01:37:27.949]  And that wasn't even the case back then.
[01:37:28.630 --> 01:37:32.149]  Though I was one of the only popular people telling the truth.
[01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:35.029]  Now it's everybody because the awakening's here.
[01:37:36.189 --> 01:37:40.210]  But these arrogant stooges think attacking him...
[01:37:40.890 --> 01:37:43.130]  And saying he plays on fears.
[01:37:43.149 --> 01:37:44.869]  He lies to people.
[01:37:45.689 --> 01:37:47.430]  They're the ones that lied about the virus.
[01:37:47.569 --> 01:37:48.770]  They're the ones that lied about the shots.
[01:37:48.909 --> 01:37:57.130]  They're the ones that admitted they wanted fear all over the world and made kids wear masks and quarantines and all this for total power and said don't watch the sunset.
[01:37:59.829 --> 01:38:07.210]  Australian Broadcasting Corporation boss Kim Williams launches an unhinged tirade against Joe Rogan.
[01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:08.210]  I'm jealous.
[01:38:09.689 --> 01:38:12.770]  People like Mr. Rogan prey on people's vulnerabilities.
[01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:14.590]  They prey on fear.
[01:38:14.710 --> 01:38:15.470]  They prey on anxiety.
[01:38:15.710 --> 01:38:18.970]  That's exactly what they did and even got declassified.
[01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:27.470]  UK, Australia, Europe, US, Canada, all run by Pentagon and their own military psychological divisions to, quote, create fear.
[01:38:28.329 --> 01:38:38.750]  I personally find it deeply repulsive and to think that someone has such remarkable power in the United States is something that I look at in disbelief.
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:46.659]  You are the ones that don't have any power, except whatever you say, people go, well, I'll do the opposite.
[01:38:47.279 --> 01:38:51.239]  So you have the power for everybody to do the opposite of what you say.
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:53.579]  And thank God you haven't figured out reverse psychology yet.
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:57.300]  If this woman told you not to take shots, people go start taking them.
[01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:10.369]  I am absolutely in dismay that this can be a source of public entertainment where it's really threatening the public and As plunder for purposes that are really quite malevolent.
[01:39:11.489 --> 01:39:11.970]  Really.
[01:39:12.590 --> 01:39:23.829]  I've got stacks of documents and new studies from all the world where everyone that they look at with all these new blood clots and heart attacks, macronitis, is the shots.
[01:39:25.069 --> 01:39:34.430]  Country by country, including Australia, New Zealand, England, Ireland, Scotland, Canada, the U.S. I mean, look at these new studies right here.
[01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:39.800]  Look at this.
[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:43.579]  I've got new studies.
[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:49.659]  I thought this was the right stack.
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:50.500]  There's so many of these.
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:55.119]  Oh, here's the head of NIH over vaccine saying it's all a fraud.
[01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:55.739]  None of it works.
[01:39:56.779 --> 01:40:10.119]  I had it in my stack Friday where the British government It said 1.7 million kids have had heart attacks from myocarditis, and they have a database.
[01:40:10.119 --> 01:40:12.199]  It's only the ones that took the shots that had it.
[01:40:12.439 --> 01:40:13.060]  I'll find it.
[01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:13.800]  We'll cover it tomorrow.
[01:40:14.539 --> 01:40:19.840]  The point is, the point is, these people are in deep crap.
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:20.399]  Oh, here it is.
[01:40:20.439 --> 01:40:20.720]  Here it is.
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:21.020]  Here it is.
[01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:21.279]  Here it is.
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:23.060]  Oh, so many stacks.
[01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:23.560]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:24.199 --> 01:40:26.939]  This is a Cambridge...
[01:40:30.210 --> 01:40:52.189]  Slash Harvard study with the government data of just 40%, that's what the government database had, of the public that took just the Pfizer shot and it found 1.7 million kids and teens who got Pfizer COVID vaccine found myocarditis only existed in the vaxxed groups.
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:56.920]  I said Cambridge.
[01:40:57.039 --> 01:40:57.720]  See, I flipped it.
[01:40:57.779 --> 01:40:58.640]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:58.859 --> 01:41:01.640]  Oxford and Harvard study with the British government.
[01:41:01.819 --> 01:41:02.119]  Sorry.
[01:41:02.899 --> 01:41:05.579]  I always mix up Cambridge and Oxford in my brain.
[01:41:05.979 --> 01:41:06.680]  Oxford, excuse me.
[01:41:07.359 --> 01:41:09.560]  So, Oxford, Harvard.
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:14.039]  So, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:17.060]  Look, oh, he's spreading fear.
[01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:18.239]  He's malevolent.
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:19.560]  No, you are your murderers.
[01:41:21.210 --> 01:41:22.689]  All right, Chase is going to take over.
[01:41:22.810 --> 01:41:23.630]  He always kicks ass.
[01:41:24.670 --> 01:41:26.689]  I prepared too much.
[01:41:26.869 --> 01:41:28.109]  I only covered like five stacks.
[01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:28.829]  There's like ten others.
[01:41:29.489 --> 01:41:31.229]  I don't care what I do.
[01:41:31.369 --> 01:41:33.710]  I'm going to come in and hit the rest of this tomorrow and everything else.
[01:41:34.460 --> 01:41:35.680]  I didn't get to the BRICS stuff.
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:40.779]  Trump is America first, folks, and people aren't going to like it around the world.
[01:41:41.159 --> 01:41:45.399]  That's how America dominates economically and culturally, not with missiles.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.899]  So good move for American economy, good move for Americans.
[01:41:49.319 --> 01:41:55.180]  It ain't going to be good for the Russians and the Chinese and the Indians and the Mexicans, I can assure you of that.
[01:41:56.140 --> 01:41:57.899]  But he's doing what he said he'd do.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.340]  You want somebody to stand up for you?
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.140]  Baby, you got it.
[01:42:01.930 --> 01:42:04.109]  And I'm trying my best as well, so thanks for your support.
