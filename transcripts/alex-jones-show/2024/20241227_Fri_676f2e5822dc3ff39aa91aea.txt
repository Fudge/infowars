[00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:26.109]  It's Friday, December 27, 2024. And I come to you from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:30.910]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:32.649]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:43.780]  Well, we were supposed to be taken off the air and removed from these studios a long time ago.
[00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:52.500]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:53.179 --> 00:01:03.340]  But thanks to you taking action, spreading the word, and supporting this broadcast, we are still here and stronger than ever.
[00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:15.049]  We are 24 days out from the inauguration of the 47th President of the United States, Donald John Trump, in the greatest comeback story in modern history.
[00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:23.230]  A contest between populist and team humanity and the globalist satanic death cult.
[00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:31.909]  Thank you again for joining us on this live Friday worldwide transmission.
[00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.959]  Okay.
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:42.780]  Wow, we've got quite a four hours laid out before us, and it's going to be very interesting, to say the least.
[00:01:43.239 --> 00:02:02.920]  I have been warning and warning and warning and warning, shooting up the red flags, lighting the watchtowers, and so is my great crew of researchers and journalists and pundits.
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:21.520]  That the globalists have announced how they will try to either kill Trump, stop him from getting into office, or hand him such disasters that he's unable to reverse their planned collapse of civilization for the post-industrial world great reset that we're fighting with the Great Awakening.
[00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:24.680]  And we've talked a lot about the way they're trying to do that.
[00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:41.330]  Escalation of war with Russia and others, that's the big one, obviously, trying to launch new hysterical Psychological warfare pandemics, civil unrest, billed as a race war to lead into a national emergency,
[00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.330]  and more.
[00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.090]  And all of those tactics are on the fast track right now.
[00:02:51.729 --> 00:03:07.610]  But yesterday at 8 a.m., The Hill, the main publication in D.C., there in Mordor on the Potomac, Democrat Party lawyers, backed by Jamie Raskin and others,
[00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.129]  came out and said, well, here's the headline.
[00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.349]  Congress has the power to block Trump from taking office, but lawmakers must act now.
[00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.830]  And I shot a report on this yesterday afternoon.
[00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:32.210]  And when I went back and I was sending the article to the crew to print it up for today, I noticed that last night it changed to this headline.
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.120]  And they even added the article some.
[00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:40.199]  Congress does not have to accept Trump's electoral votes.
[00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:53.180]  So they're introducing the idea of this, but this caused such a giant backlash and trended number one across the internet that Congress has the power, what, to override the votes of the people?
[00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.060]  So much for peaceful transfer of power, so they...
[00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.430]  Edited the article and watered it down.
[00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:10.849]  But Raskin said in August of this year that they were going to launch this plan.
[00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.389]  And it just so happens we have the details of the plan.
[00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.810]  Not just him saying we've got a plan we're going to launch.
[00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:20.589]  They war-gamed this plan in August four years ago.
[00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.990]  He said it in August six, seven months ago this year.
[00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:43.480]  But four years ago they said We have a plan, and the tops of the Democratic Party, the head of the DNC, the old war game with Obama, the New York Times wrote about it in August of 2020, that they would not accept the election of President Trump in 2020,
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.740]  and how they would have a civil war and secession.
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.220]  I'm going to show you the quotes.
[00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.730]  So that's why I've been taking this so seriously.
[00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.470]  People said, oh, they won't try it this time.
[00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.290]  That's too outrageous.
[00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:55.529]  Well, the hell they won't.
[00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:57.829]  Now, they're probably going to fail.
[00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:04.370]  And they're going to fail for sure if we don't just sit here like pigs in you-know-what and ignore what's going on.
[00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.949]  All right, stay with us on this Friday transmission.
[00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:09.149]  Remember, you're the Paul Revere's.
[00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.209]  Share the live links from Ronald Jones right now.
[00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.750]  Stay with us.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.560]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.879]  Right here on The Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.579]  It is Friday.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.079]  December 27th.
[00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:55.620]  2024, I am your embattled host, coming to you from the battle-hardened studios of InfoWars in Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.439]  All right, we have a huge, incredibly important transmission today, obviously.
[00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:17.629]  The globalists, not just here, but in Europe and around the world, are openly escalating us into economic collapse, full World War III. Virus, hysteria,
[00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:23.310]  pandemic garbage to try to bring us psychologically under their control.
[00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:37.009]  We also have big developments on the Ukraine war itself out of the Biden administration, out of the incoming Trump administration, and from Russia.
[00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:48.310]  What's happening in Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Vladimir Putin putting forward a call for an official negotiation ground to be in Slovakia.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:07:02.360]  The Biden administration is now announcing a slowing and perhaps a halting 24 days until President Trump is inaugurated of the cruise missile bombing of Russia.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:17.779]  That is certainly a good development showing that Trump is now exerting some change in this heretofore serious escalatory situation.
[00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:20.399]  It's all coming up.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:39.620]  Today, we also have the controversy of these HB1 skilled visas and Trump being critical of them, his constituency being critical of them, myself being critical of them, because the program has been massively abused by the Democrats.
[00:07:42.089 --> 00:08:06.790]  And there still is a place for it for truly highly skilled people, but not for the whole BlackRock globalist movement to replace people in Europe and the United States with foreigners that they can fully control so that you don't get any type of worker power within these companies here in the United States.
[00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.810]  You've got people they can send back anytime they...
[00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:20.370]  It really takes a lot of bargaining away from Americans, and we know American workers have been targeted for annihilation as part of this globalist siege operation.
[00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:24.470]  And so Elon's weighted big in the debate.
[00:08:24.689 --> 00:08:25.329]  Others have.
[00:08:27.379 --> 00:08:32.460]  Gave my take on what Elon was really saying last night versus what people were misrepresenting.
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:37.799]  He came back with a response to me saying exactly, so we'll look at that.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.879]  But we got Harrison Smith coming in here with me later.
[00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.690]  I agree to that to a great extent.
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:02.659]  But I also understand the perspective of people like Elon Musk, who's not flip-flopping.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.639]  He's always been for bringing in a lot of skilled foreign workers to get the job done.
[00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:11.720]  I mean, he himself is a foreign, highly skilled engineer and brain.
[00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:15.639]  So certainly nothing hypocritical from Elon, no betrayal from him.
[00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:21.220]  He really helped get Trump elected once the wide open border shut down, once all these unskilled people and criminals deported.
[00:09:23.909 --> 00:09:26.629]  That's the leg cut off that we're bleeding to death from.
[00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.909]  And then everybody's talking about a scratch on our cheek that's got a couple drops of blood coming out of it.
[00:09:32.149 --> 00:09:35.070]  So yeah, we need to fix the scratch on the cheek.
[00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:42.610]  But at the same time, there are some skilled workers that you can't get enough of here in America.
[00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:47.440]  And I think the whole argument, well, Americans are lazy and dumb, so that's why we've got to bring them from overseas.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.500]  Vivek kind of came out and said that, and I don't really agree with the way he put it, very ham-fisted.
[00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:56.620]  And so that's been reflecting on Elon.
[00:09:56.799 --> 00:10:00.879]  I mean, I still really like Vivek a lot, but I thought we almost got kind of a leftist answer from him.
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:07.000]  So I think there's a lot more to the story here, so I'll give you my take on that coming up as well.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.200]  But first...
[00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:13.519]  I want to hit the big enchilada in front of us.
[00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:20.740]  Now, when Jamie Raskin, the head of the J6 Fraudulent Committee, came out in August and promoted this of this year, I said, this is serious.
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.759]  They're going to make this move.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.940]  People said, oh, no way.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.399]  That's too crazy.
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:32.220]  They're not going to not have Congress certify Trump and then just null and void the election if he wins.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.259]  And I said, the hell they won't.
[00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:35.940]  But you see...
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:54.700]  Now that they've openly announced this and are trying this, it's official in Congress, there's one last ingredient they'll need, and that's false flags here in the next few weeks that will legitimize the political climate they believe to somehow create such a civil crisis,
[00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:58.240]  civil emergency, national emergency, they can do it.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.860]  I don't believe they're going to get away with it.
[00:11:01.299 --> 00:11:03.980]  I believe it's going to backfire because we got ahead of it.
[00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:07.580]  That said, though, we still have to focus on it.
[00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:09.720]  Now, here's a great example of that.
[00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:11.460]  This headline goes up 8 a.m.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.279]  yesterday on the Hill.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.059]  It was also pushed by CNN, MSNBC, New York Times, Washington Post.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.500]  Had similar articles, but not with a headline this strong.
[00:11:19.039 --> 00:11:24.580]  So they're making their moves, so they start their propaganda offensive first, 24 days out from the inauguration.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.120]  25 yesterday.
[00:11:26.679 --> 00:11:31.360]  Congress has the power to block Trump from taking office, but lawmakers must act now.
[00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:47.029]  Now, last night, this one up at 8 a.m., last night, they changed the headline to Congress does not have to accept Trump's electoral vote.
[00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:51.929]  And they actually edited the article, too, so they spun it.
[00:11:53.610 --> 00:12:00.029]  So that shows there's major opposition to, yeah, openly stealing an election after someone's won it.
[00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:03.370]  But that's what NATO just did a month ago in...
[00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:22.490]  Romania, they elected a popular anti-globalist that doesn't want war with Russia, so NATO just said, through your intelligence agency, we null and void your election, and there's basically a dictatorship now, just like Zelensky canceled elections a year ago and is a dictator, and has outlawed his political opposition and the Orthodox Church and everything else.
[00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.509]  So this is a big deal, and I'm going to break this down in detail.
[00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:27.590]  There's been more detail since I shot this report.
[00:12:28.439 --> 00:12:32.679]  Yesterday afternoon, but we did a good job laying it out.
[00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:37.220]  When I say we, I shot a lot of it, but then Rob and I worked on the documents, the research, the background.
[00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:43.000]  And this is the best analysis of what's currently going on and why this is so serious.
[00:12:43.019 --> 00:12:44.279]  It's about 11 minutes long.
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:52.659]  Then I'm going to come back and give some more details of this and how we stop this next desperate move by the globalists.
[00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:53.240]  Here it is.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:08.860]  Well, the Democrats were unable to steal the 2024 election, and now, just as Jamie Raskin promised, they are moving to block Congress from certifying the election, claiming Trump was convicted of insurrection, something that never happened.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.580]  We're about to lay it out right now.
[00:13:20.309 --> 00:13:35.769]  Is to turn the Islamists loose, turn the Black Lives Matter loose, turn the Antifa loose, turn the MS-13 loose, and murder and kill and burn and bomb and say, it's because of Trump,
[00:13:35.769 --> 00:13:37.370]  he's a white supremacist.
[00:13:37.889 --> 00:13:39.789]  He's created this crisis.
[00:13:40.169 --> 00:13:43.570]  We've got to remove him in a national crisis from power.
[00:13:43.909 --> 00:13:49.190]  So either way, they've telegraphed, they've prepared, they've gotten ready for what they're going to do.
[00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.710]  I mean, this is really bad.
[00:13:51.929 --> 00:13:54.429]  This is an open declaration of civil war.
[00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.370]  These people are, they're our enemies.
[00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.929]  This clip that I'm going to do videos on will be on Infowars.com.
[00:14:02.029 --> 00:14:03.210]  I haven't put it out on X yet.
[00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.330]  That they brought me, and I checked, this is just a day or so ago.
[00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:24.500]  High-level Democrat operative, his father, famous communist operative of the Soviet Union, Representative Jamie Raskin, It says Congress will stop Donald Trump on J6 using the 14th Amendment and create civil war conditions once President Trump is elected.
[00:14:27.259 --> 00:14:29.039]  Civil war conditions.
[00:14:29.379 --> 00:14:30.379]  They already tried to kill him.
[00:14:31.139 --> 00:14:32.980]  Now they're trying to start a war with Iran.
[00:14:33.159 --> 00:14:35.320]  This is crazy town stuff.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:39.019]  Everything they accuse Trump of, they're publicly doing.
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.000]  I am predicting Trump and the American people will override this.
[00:14:44.129 --> 00:14:54.009]  If they don't kill Trump in the next 14 days, and I'm going to say this again, he becomes president-elect, that's when they start the civil unrest and the wars, because they're still going to be in control, and he's not going to be the president yet.
[00:14:54.250 --> 00:15:04.669]  And now Carble and all of them are on the television saying, we need an armed uprising if Trump is re-elected.
[00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:06.169]  Wow!
[00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.490]  Can you imagine if I said that?
[00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.909]  By the way, if they steal the election, that's the last thing we want.
[00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:18.629]  That'll blow up in their face so big if we don't uprise, it'll destroy them politically 100 times.
[00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.429]  But they're gonna provide the attacks and blameless, don't you worry.
[00:15:24.309 --> 00:15:25.570]  Little hearts about that.
[00:15:26.769 --> 00:15:29.370]  So, there is no longer any doubt.
[00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:38.490]  I had seen some signs two weeks ago that some of the more sane arms of the globalists were saying, okay, we'll try to discredit Trump once he gets in and hand him the lemon economy.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.860]  And I saw some behavior as if they were thinking about pulling back.
[00:15:44.039 --> 00:15:45.659]  Nope, they're not pulling back.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:57.539]  But every globalist publication, from the New York Times, the London Guardian, to the Atlantic Monthly, they're all telling you civil war martial law, and they got the movies and all of it prepared.
[00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:07.320]  And then all their surrogates are all over the place saying, civil war is coming, it's all Trump's fault, he's going to have the military kill you.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:17.519]  Now that's so they can bait and switch it while he's president-elect and they use the military on him after they trigger a bunch of stuff and false flags to blame Trump supporters.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:29.240]  Or if he gets in, they've got legislation introduced under Senator Blumenthal to strip the executive the power of the military domestically, which is a constitutional crisis and a legislative coup against the executive.
[00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:31.799]  I keep explaining.
[00:16:31.799 --> 00:16:34.340]  They're clearly planning civil unrest.
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.000]  They're gonna bill it as race war.
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.960]  They're gonna declare martial law.
[00:16:40.429 --> 00:16:43.549]  When and if President Trump wins the election or even if he doesn't.
[00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:49.190]  And I literally have hundreds of clips of all the top strategists and pundits saying this.
[00:16:50.730 --> 00:17:15.210]  Well, so much for a peaceful transfer of power that the Democrats were making such a big deal about because they thought they'd be able to steal the 2024 election like they were able to do the 2021. No, Jamie Raskin, who helped head up the fraudulent January 6th committee and a bunch of Democrat Party lawyers have been writing pieces in places like The Hill today and other publications saying Congress must act now.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:28.700]  To block Trump's electors coming up in the next few weeks for his certification on January 6th to be the 47th president of the United States.
[00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:35.920]  They want to block the popular vote that Trump won and of course the Electoral College that he won.
[00:17:36.119 --> 00:17:42.759]  In a landslide, despite the entire establishment coming after him and the American people.
[00:17:42.859 --> 00:17:48.240]  And why this is such a huge concern is, they don't have a leg to stand on, but they don't care.
[00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:56.839]  They cite in the Hill article, basically exact stuff that Jamie Raskin, that fraud's been pushing, that three times he was found to have committed an insurrection.
[00:17:57.119 --> 00:18:09.180]  In the first impeachment, well, actually there, Or their first source is one of his impeachments for insurrection, but he was found not guilty by the Senate.
[00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:10.220]  They didn't have the votes.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:37.359]  Then they mentioned a judiciary hearing of judges in Colorado when they tried to take Trump off the ballot that was overridden by higher We're about to break it all down.
[00:18:38.019 --> 00:18:41.759]  What can be put into the Constitution can slip away from you very quickly.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:54.720]  And the greatest example going on right now before our very eyes is Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which they're just disappearing with a magic wand as if it doesn't exist, even though it could not be clearer What it's stating.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.180]  And so, you know, they want to kick it to Congress.
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:05.500]  So it's going to be up to us on January 6th, 2025 to tell the rampaging Trump mobs that he's disqualified.
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:21.519]  And then we need bodyguards for everybody and civil war conditions all because the nine justices, not all of them, but these justices who have not many cases to look at every year, not that much work to do, a huge staff, great protection,
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:31.049]  simply do not want To do their job and interpret what the great 14th amendment means and I'm glad that Sherilyn's creating her new center so we can bring that.
[00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:56.599]  Now we've seen a lot of fraud and a lot of hoaxes and lies with Democrats but the idea that section three of the 14th amendment from the civil war that civil war generals and Jefferson Davis the president of the Confederacy couldn't be in government It has nothing to do with President Trump who wasn't ever convicted of insurrection.
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.619]  And I've already made that point.
[00:19:58.759 --> 00:20:00.559]  But notice what Raskin said.
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:05.420]  He said, we implement this amendment and then we go to civil war conditions.
[00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:17.250]  And they had a plan, and we'll show you the articles, back in 2000, that if Trump won, they were gonna have Western blue states secede, and they would have their own inauguration for Joe Biden.
[00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:19.029]  I mean, this is real insurrection.
[00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.170]  This is real civil war.
[00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:27.390]  So as usual, what they're blaming Trump and Trump supporters and Republicans for is what they themselves are doing.
[00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:29.230]  And that's what's so dangerous here.
[00:20:29.809 --> 00:20:44.750]  Is that they are trying to have the electors not vote for Trump without a conviction, but pretending like in the news, and Raskin's been all over TV for months, as you know, saying this, that he is precluded by law from being the president.
[00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:49.029]  But notice they didn't make a big issue about that actually during the campaign.
[00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:54.569]  They just said they had it ready because they knew the public would get educated once that debate happened.
[00:20:54.589 --> 00:20:57.269]  So they want to sneak attack in and try to confuse people.
[00:20:57.329 --> 00:20:57.950]  But here's the key.
[00:20:59.839 --> 00:21:02.500]  They've been pre-programming that Trump supporters are gonna kill minorities.
[00:21:02.819 --> 00:21:07.359]  They need a false flag to legitimize all of this and get this done.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.160]  So a lot of people are laughing at this attempt.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.619]  It's no laughing matter.
[00:21:11.519 --> 00:21:12.799]  Or don't even have to kill them.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:18.059]  They just say, oh my God, white supremacists attacked and killed all these migrants.
[00:21:18.259 --> 00:21:19.039]  Oh, it's Trump's fault.
[00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:20.779]  And then burn down half the country.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.900]  And then the Democrats just say, Trump's not getting in.
[00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:26.000]  We've uncertified him.
[00:21:26.059 --> 00:21:27.220]  And you're like, well, that's unconstitutional.
[00:21:27.559 --> 00:21:29.279]  Yeah, all this is.
[00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:35.819]  And then that creates total bedlam and we basically have a civil war.
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.779]  And they're crazy enough to destabilize everything and wreck everything.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.660]  Even if they won't win this, they still may do it.
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:49.779]  And that's why we've got to admit they're doing it and admit they're programming it and admit they're trying it.
[00:21:50.579 --> 00:22:04.190]  If you think they're not going to stage some false flags, if you think they're not going to try to crank up some wars, launch a cyber attack, knock the power out, stuff like that, When they pre-programmed it all, then you're naive.
[00:22:05.069 --> 00:22:12.430]  But if they know, we know, and we're watching them, and they already got caught in all this election fraud, there's a good chance they'll stand down.
[00:22:12.809 --> 00:22:20.349]  I'd say about a 60% chance right now they stand down, which would be the smart move.
[00:22:20.609 --> 00:22:25.960]  In closing, This is completely undemocratic.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.920]  It's absolutely un-American.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:34.440]  And it really illustrates how the Democratic Party is not going to accept this election.
[00:22:34.819 --> 00:22:48.680]  And that even once Trump gets in, they've got a plan for civil uprisings that they claim are coming because Trump's gonna kill migrants, he's gonna kill black people, Raskin, Carville, all of them have said that Trump supporters are gonna massacre minorities.
[00:22:49.289 --> 00:22:56.430]  That's coming out of a clear blue sky unless they are planning to stage it or wind up a bunch of crazies to do it.
[00:22:56.549 --> 00:23:04.809]  And then that will be the excuse if he actually gets into office to drive him from office using civil war conditions that they've also talked about.
[00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.009]  To quote Carvel, Trump's coming to kill black people.
[00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.450]  They need to have an armed uprising if he gets into office.
[00:23:10.769 --> 00:23:11.829]  These people are dangerous.
[00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.750]  They're not just saying all this and doing all this for no reason.
[00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:16.029]  They are planning it.
[00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.670]  Trump needs to come out and speak out against this.
[00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:20.190]  All of us do.
[00:23:20.509 --> 00:23:27.029]  This is serious because they'll never get away with what they're trying unless they've got some big provocations.
[00:23:27.329 --> 00:23:29.890]  I'll be covering this all on the Friday show tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[00:23:30.009 --> 00:23:33.390]  Central and then fullwars.com forward slash show and ban.video.
[00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:34.829]  But this is very, very serious.
[00:23:35.009 --> 00:23:45.940]  They want to override the voters of America and try to put in who if he's not the That would disregard the entire election.
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:49.200]  That's called a coup hiding in plain view.
[00:23:49.339 --> 00:23:53.880]  Be sure to follow me on X for breaking news and updates because you are the resistance.
[00:23:54.279 --> 00:23:58.059]  Talk about the fact that President Trump incited an erection.
[00:24:01.559 --> 00:24:07.799]  His various cases of, you know, he's got inciting charges of inciting an erection.
[00:24:11.009 --> 00:24:15.250]  Donald John Trump incited the erection.
[00:24:17.809 --> 00:24:19.329]  They didn't like Donald Trump.
[00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.730]  They said he participated in an erection.
[00:24:23.809 --> 00:24:25.549]  I always call it massive.
[00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:28.009]  Sometimes they say huge.
[00:24:28.589 --> 00:24:29.950]  Really large.
[00:24:37.589 --> 00:24:42.150]  Now, We just laid out the facts there.
[00:24:42.369 --> 00:24:50.210]  And to me, this is a no-brainer how outrageous and dangerous this is.
[00:24:50.529 --> 00:25:09.269]  And it really illustrates that despite the major global political realignment happening, this is a lot bigger than just the United States, the leftist, black rock, globalist, political blob is not giving up.
[00:25:10.109 --> 00:25:11.130]  It's not going away.
[00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:16.690]  Now, that only enrages the populist population around the world.
[00:25:16.829 --> 00:25:20.049]  That only accelerates the Great Awakening.
[00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:26.750]  If they were smart, they'd back off and maintain their wealth and power and then sneak attack later once people went back to sleep.
[00:25:27.809 --> 00:25:40.640]  That's not what they're doing because They understand that they are fundamentally losing their power as new centers of wealth and new competition comes into the world.
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:58.140]  And technology's grown so much, and the globalist technocracy has been suppressing a lot of it, but it's still getting out there, that if they don't get full control, very, very soon, that's the point of world government, is to stop competition and basically sew up society so there's not a future.
[00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:06.269]  You can read quotes by Obama and Zbigniew Brzezinski and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and others, where they talk about the end of history.
[00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:17.609]  Meaning everything is corporate controlled, so sewn up, so totalitarian, that you own nothing, you eat the bugs, you're on a universal basic income.
[00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:20.990]  There's the illusion of competition, but it's really not there.
[00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:24.069]  There's a government corporate AI monopoly.
[00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:26.289]  I mean, all of this has come out now.
[00:26:27.279 --> 00:26:29.000]  All of these things have come out now.
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.599]  And we're going to go to break here in a few minutes.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.039]  And I'm going to come back with Julian Assange years ago.
[00:26:34.579 --> 00:26:37.299]  This is like eight, nine years ago making this point.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.519]  And it's even more true today.
[00:26:39.759 --> 00:26:42.059]  So this Julian Assange statement is not evergreen.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.779]  It's ultra green.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.000]  It doesn't stay strong.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.539]  It gets stronger with time.
[00:26:47.539 --> 00:26:51.599]  Then I'm going to shift into all the other big news that we're dealing with here.
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:52.500]  But please remember...
[00:26:53.349 --> 00:26:54.769]  I am taking on the deep state.
[00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:56.210]  I am taking on the globalists.
[00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:57.529]  They're in trouble.
[00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:04.089]  They're losing, but they are striking back at who they see as the leadership of the global awakening.
[00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:06.170]  And I am in that bucket.
[00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:12.589]  And I'm proud of that, proud of your support that we were able to get to that point because that means we've damaged them, we've hurt them.
[00:27:13.049 --> 00:27:14.309]  Team Humanity is turning the tide.
[00:27:14.509 --> 00:27:22.549]  But as an individual and as an organization, as we hurtle into 2025, myself and this crew is counting on you for support.

[00:27:32.369 --> 00:27:34.289]  God saved us three times the last seven months.
[00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:36.789]  I'm praying it'll happen again, but nothing's for sure.
[00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:38.470]  So pray for the broadcast.
[00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:39.289]  Pray for justice.

[00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:34.410]  I'm not about to see your light But if you wanna find help with me I'm gonna show you what it's like Till you're bleeding I'm not about to see your light It is Friday,
[00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:54.450]  December 27th, 2024. I am your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide in defense of liberty and in total resistance to tyranny!
[00:30:06.599 --> 00:30:12.579]  It's the spirit of liberty and the spirit of resistance that the tyrants hate.
[00:30:12.779 --> 00:30:23.619]  They thought they'd stamped out the fire of freedom of our hearts and minds and souls, but all they did was awaken the Sleeping Giant!
[00:30:37.599 --> 00:30:52.940]  Can you believe, and I know you can, because we all predicted it, and then they promoted it, and now they've openly launched a plan to stop the electors from certifying Trump on January 6th, everything they accused him of.
[00:30:53.799 --> 00:30:59.019]  And they clearly stole that election in 2020, and he was simply wanting an investigation, but they never allowed it.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:06.000]  But then the last four years, the investigation was done, and it was all proven to be true and worse than we had even said.
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:14.180]  And now they know that Trump's going to have his election integrity commission and they're going to ferret out the fraud in the blue cities and states.
[00:31:14.859 --> 00:31:17.000]  And it's bye-bye Democratic Party.
[00:31:18.299 --> 00:31:20.140]  They made their run at America.
[00:31:20.319 --> 00:31:22.460]  They tried to totally destroy this country.
[00:31:22.619 --> 00:31:25.380]  They did a pretty good job, but they didn't complete it.
[00:31:26.039 --> 00:31:27.279]  Yeah, we're torn up.
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.460]  But at the end of the day, it only makes us stronger.
[00:31:30.759 --> 00:31:34.559]  That which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:31:34.839 --> 00:31:35.779]  Frederick Nietzsche.
[00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:41.170]  All right, so don't forget what they're up to right now.
[00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:49.069]  Scurrying around up there, saying that they are going to try to block Trump.
[00:31:49.569 --> 00:31:51.329]  And you're thinking, well, that'll never work.
[00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:53.490]  That's outrageous, openly nullifying an election.
[00:31:53.730 --> 00:32:02.069]  Well, if they think they can get away with it, they are going to do it.
[00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:05.849]  And so, how do you stop that?
[00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:10.089]  Well, you admit they're up to it.
[00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:12.609]  You face it.
[00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:16.029]  It sounds crazy to say they're trying to nullify the election, but they are.
[00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:19.390]  It sounds crazy to say they're trying to legalize pedophilia, but they are.
[00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:24.930]  It sounds crazy to say they're trying to brainwash tens of millions of kids every year to be sterilized, but they are.
[00:32:25.009 --> 00:32:27.690]  It sounds crazy they're bombing Russia, but they are.
[00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:33.049]  It's all crazy that they just turned over Syria to al-Qaeda, but they did.
[00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.829]  So...
[00:32:35.859 --> 00:32:36.460]  It's crazy.
[00:32:36.619 --> 00:32:38.660]  We got a $37 trillion debt and growing.
[00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:42.220]  And basically half the money coming to the Treasury goes to the debt now.
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.220]  But it's happening.
[00:32:45.819 --> 00:32:49.839]  It's crazy that the insurance actuaries show 30 plus million dead from the shots.
[00:32:50.039 --> 00:32:50.980]  But it happened.
[00:32:51.339 --> 00:32:54.819]  And now it sounds crazy they're trying to launch a new pandemic hysteria.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.559]  But they are.
[00:32:56.579 --> 00:33:00.200]  So it's not negative to face bad things that are happening.
[00:33:00.339 --> 00:33:01.539]  It's extremely positive.
[00:33:01.539 --> 00:33:06.769]  What's negative is Is to have a tooth that's got a cavity and not going and getting it fixed.
[00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:09.890]  So a year later, the whole tooth's gone and rots out and they have to pull it.
[00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:12.950]  The tooth is savable.
[00:33:14.309 --> 00:33:15.750]  But not for much longer.
[00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.369]  And the good news is we politically are taking control.
[00:33:18.569 --> 00:33:23.609]  We're in the dentist's chair and they're drilling and getting it fixed and cleaned out and filled right now.
[00:33:24.089 --> 00:33:28.769]  And the bad guys do not like it to say the least.
[00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:31.490]  So just all this other news is insanely important as well.
[00:33:31.589 --> 00:33:40.099]  But to the Democrats, Sticking their head up and saying we're going to nullify the election and then pull them back because they met what?
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:40.720]  What'd they meet?
[00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:41.519]  Opposition.
[00:33:41.859 --> 00:33:45.619]  Informed, focused, dedicated opposition.
[00:33:45.819 --> 00:33:52.920]  All the victory you're seeing is because people got off the bench and started speaking out and started supporting.
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.160]  And that's how you win wars.
[00:33:57.319 --> 00:33:57.599]  All right.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.099]  I mentioned this earlier.
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:01.039]  I just want to play the clip now.
[00:34:01.299 --> 00:34:02.660]  This is Julian Assange.
[00:34:04.289 --> 00:34:07.869]  A long, long, long, long, long time ago.
[00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:11.269]  This was almost 10 years ago.
[00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:15.349]  Even before he was locked up and then actually put in prison.
[00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.090]  Now, of course, freed, thank God.
[00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:23.590]  And here's this journalist of journalists.
[00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:26.829]  Explaining that we don't have a society.
[00:34:27.309 --> 00:34:29.489]  That there's a broken social contract.
[00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:31.650]  That's what the environmental movement is.
[00:34:31.769 --> 00:34:33.969]  That's what globalism is as a post-industrial world.
[00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:36.349]  Neo-feudalism in their own words.
[00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:37.630]  The end of history.
[00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.449]  Shutting everybody down but their own operations.
[00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:44.969]  And now with populists winning elections everywhere.
[00:34:45.289 --> 00:34:46.750]  And Trudeau on his way out.
[00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:48.710]  And Keir Starmer on his way out.
[00:34:48.769 --> 00:34:49.610]  And the list goes on and on.
[00:34:49.809 --> 00:34:52.730]  And the corrupt globalists in Germany holding on by their fingernails.
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:54.760]  This is exciting.
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.139]  And it doesn't mean the new people are perfect.
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.800]  It doesn't mean the bad guys won't strike back.
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.480]  It doesn't mean we're saying there's some utopia around the corner.
[00:35:01.619 --> 00:35:08.599]  But it's a society based on prosperity and justice and freedom and security and competition.
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:20.679]  Reaching for that, instead of just giving up and letting the globalists run everything and run us into the ground, show that they have a total monopoly over every facet of human life.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.659]  Cultural, economic, spiritual, physical.
[00:35:27.539 --> 00:35:28.699]  Here's Assange.
[00:35:29.199 --> 00:35:33.139]  There is no society anymore.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:44.699]  What there is, is a transnational security elite That is busy carving up the world using your tax money.
[00:35:45.079 --> 00:35:49.139]  To combat that elite we must not petition.
[00:35:50.659 --> 00:35:52.519]  We must take it over.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:29.159]  We must form our own networks of strength and mutual value which can challenge those strengths and Self-interested values of the warmongers in this country and in others that have formed hand in hand an alliance to take money from the United States and every NATO country from Australia and launder it through
[00:36:29.159 --> 00:36:39.039]  Afghanistan, launder it through Iraq, launder it through Somalia, Launder it through Yemen.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.619]  Launder it through Pakistan.
[00:36:41.139 --> 00:36:43.780]  And wash that money in people's blood.
[00:36:45.099 --> 00:36:47.679]  And wash that money in people's blood.
[00:36:47.679 --> 00:36:51.980]  And now they've got Ukraine and Syria and all these other bigger money laundering operations.
[00:36:52.219 --> 00:36:54.079]  All of that is 100% true.
[00:36:54.239 --> 00:36:56.480]  That is a perfectly accurate statement.
[00:36:57.039 --> 00:36:58.039]  A hole in one.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.119]  And so the security state uses crises.
[00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:05.059]  They create or exacerbate.
[00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:06.460]  They don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.219]  Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel said.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.420]  And it's come out.
[00:37:11.539 --> 00:37:17.840]  Who's writing these articles in the New York Times and the Hill about don't seat Trump, block his election?
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.119]  Look up the writers of them.
[00:37:21.219 --> 00:37:28.179]  It's Obama officers, Obama operatives, Obama lawyers.
[00:37:29.719 --> 00:37:30.739]  That's who's doing this.
[00:37:32.219 --> 00:37:33.179]  They're the ones.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.739]  So, shifting gears into Ukraine...
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.840]  Big developments the last few days.
[00:37:39.059 --> 00:37:41.920]  Putin said, I believe in God and God is on our side.
[00:37:42.039 --> 00:37:43.000]  We cannot be defeated.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.239]  Boy, when leaders start talking like that, hmm.
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:55.460]  Lavrov, the foreign minister, Russia's patience on using nuclear weapons is not limitless and it would not hesitate to defend itself by all means necessary.
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:02.079]  Russian official deems Ukraine ceasefire a path to nowhere but welcomes Trump.
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:03.780]  Negotiations.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.460]  Lavrov goes on to say, we know the deep state runs things.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.800]  They ignored Trump when he said get out of Syria.
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.320]  We'll be surprised if they don't kill Trump.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.179]  Putin said that.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.280]  Lavrov said that.
[00:38:13.719 --> 00:38:16.679]  Yedyev's all said that months ago, weeks ago, and again over the weekend.
[00:38:17.219 --> 00:38:19.500]  They said, boy, we sure hope they don't kill Trump.
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:23.659]  We know he's not a psychotic, but these people do whatever they want.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.820]  Remember, they blew up the Nord Stream pipeline and blame Russia.
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.739]  And so Russia is saying, listen...
[00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:32.489]  NATO's been attacking us for 14 years in Ukraine.
[00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:38.010]  We're not going to make a deal unless they agree to not join NATO and demilitarize.
[00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:39.429]  That's why we went in there.
[00:38:40.889 --> 00:38:45.269]  Ukraine slows firing of missiles into Russia as Trump prepares to take office.
[00:38:45.469 --> 00:38:47.710]  New York Times, that's some good news.
[00:38:48.369 --> 00:38:51.309]  They admit Trump's putting pressure on Biden to de-escalate.
[00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:53.789]  He's already cut $24 billion.
[00:38:53.789 --> 00:38:57.630]  Trump did by pressure on the Speaker of the House a few weeks ago.
[00:38:58.739 --> 00:39:03.380]  Putin says Slovakia could be host for peace talks with Ukraine.
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:10.820]  Remember, the Slovakian president, Robert Fico, had been the main guy trying to get peace, so they pumped four bullets into him six months ago.
[00:39:12.679 --> 00:39:17.960]  Breaking ex-NATO chief Stoltenberg named new head of Bilderberg Group.
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.320]  It's even reported on the New York Times.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:25.219]  Just 15, 14 years ago, the New York Times...
[00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:38.210]  Would say Jones is insane in France or in Switzerland or in England or the U.S. or in Istanbul, Turkey covering Bilderberg meetings.
[00:39:38.489 --> 00:39:39.690]  Jones is insane.
[00:39:39.949 --> 00:39:44.730]  He's in the woods in Chantilly, Virginia at a hotel imagining there's world leaders there.
[00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.610]  Got footage of it, the helicopters, the troops.
[00:39:47.789 --> 00:39:49.730]  I stayed in once they actually closed it.
[00:39:49.929 --> 00:39:52.090]  The King of Spain showed up, got video of that.
[00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:53.789]  Then they threw me out.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.480]  They played the national anthem when he walked in.
[00:39:56.599 --> 00:40:00.940]  And the New York Times wrote a big article saying, Jones is insane.
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.320]  And I think the headline was like, New World Order, Alex Jones.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.780]  What year was that?
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:14.099]  That was 2009. I've got the exact headline, but I mean, I've shown it to you many times, you can pull it up.
[00:40:14.219 --> 00:40:18.079]  And it just says, Jones is schizophrenic in the woods, imagining that there's a world government.
[00:40:18.539 --> 00:40:19.920]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[00:40:20.039 --> 00:40:21.400]  Oh, where are they now?
[00:40:21.679 --> 00:40:22.940]  Oh, yeah, we got a world government.
[00:40:23.079 --> 00:40:23.880]  Yeah, it's unelected.
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.519]  Yeah, the EU Commission's unelected.
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:27.519]  It's for your own interest.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:29.920]  Trump's anti-democratic.
[00:40:32.139 --> 00:40:34.900]  So, wow, how far we've come.
[00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:40.449]  Ukraine says North Korean troops are suffering heavy battlefield losses, thousands of dead troops.
[00:40:40.809 --> 00:40:42.909]  Who knows if that's true, but it is all insane.
[00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:53.210]  Putin says Biden offered to delay Ukraine ascension into NATO in 2021. Russian president says the only thing I believe in is God and God is with us.
[00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:55.269]  This video is all of that.
[00:40:55.369 --> 00:40:56.010]  Here's one of them.
[00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:58.130]  It's subtitled, but let's just get it on record.
[00:40:58.769 --> 00:41:00.769]  Here's the foreign minister, Lavrov.
[00:41:05.639 --> 00:41:10.920]  Saying that Moscow has no illusions about an easy resolution of the Ukraine crisis.
[00:41:11.199 --> 00:41:11.440]  Here it is.
[00:41:12.239 --> 00:41:15.159]  We can't make a empty conversation.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.639]  All we hear is talking about the need to create some peace.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.480]  And we don't have to mention that this peace is needed to make peace for the rest of Ukraine.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.500]  To make peace for the rest of Ukraine.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:27.920]  To make peace for the rest of Ukraine.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.579]  To make peace for the rest of Ukraine.
[00:41:28.579 --> 00:41:29.860]  To make peace for the rest of Ukraine.
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:33.760]  To make peace for the rest of Ukraine.
[00:41:56.570 --> 00:42:04.199]  Now, I saw these videos yesterday on X, just separately, I didn't see anybody tying them together.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.079]  So that's something I'm going to do now.
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:09.300]  Just to give you a microcosm of leftist policies.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:12.280]  And now Russia has said, we don't want to transgender our kids.
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:12.860]  We don't want to...
[00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:14.989]  Eat a bunch of GMO food.
[00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:16.170]  We don't want world government.
[00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:17.389]  We want to have our own culture.
[00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:20.190]  And for that, they're so demonized by the left world.
[00:42:20.409 --> 00:42:20.409]  Why?
[00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:28.010]  Because for 85 years, Russia was under globalist leftist control and was a testing ground for their evil and a launch base to take over the world for communism.
[00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:30.429]  Now it's orthodox czarist.
[00:42:30.949 --> 00:42:32.190]  It's not communist.
[00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:35.230]  You hear a lot of right-wingers go, you know, they're still communist and they're...
[00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:36.090]  No, no.
[00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:37.369]  We're the communist here.
[00:42:38.099 --> 00:42:42.559]  And we're going through the same process Russia's gone through of trying to get back control of our country.
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:44.099]  Doesn't mean Russia's perfect.
[00:42:44.179 --> 00:42:46.119]  Doesn't mean we'll be perfect once we get back control either.
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.900]  But the new world order has got to go.
[00:42:49.159 --> 00:42:58.849]  So I saw the Russian Christmas Eve, because their Christmas starts later, Than ours.
[00:42:59.469 --> 00:43:04.170]  On the start of Russia, so it's called the Eve of the Start of their Christmas, because it's two weeks long.
[00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.190]  I'm butchering it, but it's longer than ours.
[00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:08.230]  And it goes into January.
[00:43:08.889 --> 00:43:24.449]  And so on the Eve of the Russian Christmas, on their Christmas Eve, at a church on national TV in Ukraine, broadcast into Russia, after they banned the Orthodox Church a year ago and banned all the other political parties, even ones that agreed with them, and took over all the media,
[00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:30.050]  they show devils In Ukrainian slash Russian, same language.
[00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:33.190]  It's like Texans talk different than New Yorkers.
[00:43:33.289 --> 00:43:33.869]  It's still English.
[00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:36.730]  Or, you know, Mexicans speak Spanish, but it's Spanglish.
[00:43:37.289 --> 00:43:38.489]  You know, there they are.
[00:43:38.789 --> 00:43:42.389]  And blasphemous stuff about, we're going to kill the Russians.
[00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:43.690]  Satan's going to give us power.
[00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:47.690]  In front of a...
[00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:53.550]  Orthodox church that they've seized, or inside one.
[00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:56.170]  So, I mean, imagine...
[00:43:57.869 --> 00:44:10.409]  This message, and just like our NFL's anti-Christian and Hollywood and the rappers and the rock and roll, I mean, almost every music video you see now, Katy Perry's put on a new satanic, demon-possessed thing for Christmas.
[00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:12.829]  So, it's about desecrating Christianity.
[00:44:14.739 --> 00:44:26.559]  Meanwhile, though, you don't see that for the Muslims, because Muslims won't put up with it, and you don't see that with Zelensky on state-run television over there as well.
[00:44:27.079 --> 00:44:28.400]  We'll run B-roll of that.
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:35.119]  It's clip 11. You've got Zelensky meeting with the Orthodox Jews, and they're having the menorah.
[00:44:35.679 --> 00:44:42.500]  And they're talking about how honorable it is, and they've got big lightings of them outside, and they're reading in Hebrew.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:43.880]  There's a whole bunch of these videos.
[00:44:44.019 --> 00:44:45.519]  It's very pretty, very nice, great.
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:55.760]  So imagine what these Jews would do if they had state-run TV inside a synagogue with a bunch of devils saying blasphemous stuff.
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:45:04.260]  And when I posted on X, there's a transcript of what they were saying in Ukrainian about Satan's got the power, we're going to kill all the Russians, we're going to murder you, on and on and on.
[00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:06.789]  And it's going on in Germany as well.
[00:45:06.949 --> 00:45:08.829]  They've got all this satanic stuff for Christmas.
[00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:13.030]  Islamist, liberal, nutball, whatever they are, running over people.
[00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:17.809]  And the media won't even say that it was a crazy Islamist or crazy Saudi Arabian doing it.
[00:45:17.889 --> 00:45:18.949]  They say a car did it.
[00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:21.650]  And then look at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.
[00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:27.050]  Nice, beautiful menorah up there in front of it.
[00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:33.369]  But nothing from the government.
[00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:35.630]  About Christmas.
[00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:45.670]  And the BBC responded when the crazy guy last week killed all those Christians or all those Christmas revelers in Germany by saying, we're not going to use the word Christmas anymore.
[00:45:45.789 --> 00:45:47.409]  It's causing this.
[00:45:48.449 --> 00:45:50.130]  So, Islam's okay.
[00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:51.329]  Judaism's okay.
[00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:52.590]  Buddhism's okay.
[00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:55.610]  Hinduism's okay.
[00:45:56.429 --> 00:45:59.650]  Satanism's promoted in the schools around the country, as you know, and around the West.
[00:45:59.809 --> 00:46:01.269]  But you...
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.159]  Do not promote anything connected to Christianity.
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.739]  That's got to be desecrated.
[00:46:12.559 --> 00:46:20.599]  And the other thing they do is the American flag and the founding fathers taking down their statues, even Teddy Roosevelt, who's a huge civil rights guy, because he's a white guy.
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.079]  And so that's where all this is going.
[00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:28.539]  Now, speaking of that, it's a very complex issue.
[00:46:28.539 --> 00:46:33.119]  We'll be covering it all more coming up in the second, third, and fourth hour interspersed with other news today.
[00:46:34.719 --> 00:46:38.000]  But I wanted to hit this right now on this December 27th Friday transmission.
[00:46:39.039 --> 00:46:42.619]  There are these HB1 highly skilled visas.
[00:46:43.599 --> 00:46:56.480]  And there's an example of this before they called it HB1 at the end of World War II. The US government wanted all the scientists and rocket experts and aerospace experts and experts on the Soviet Union's networks.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:01.199]  And so 20 plus thousand Nazis were brought over the United States in Operation Paperclip.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:04.699]  Now I think that's a bad example of what HB-1 became.
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:17.340]  But Wernher von Braun that created NASA was one of those Nazis, the head of the Nazi rocket program, space program, weapon program, super weapon program, to be technical, but they called it in German, translated.
[00:47:18.159 --> 00:47:18.599]  So...
[00:47:20.349 --> 00:47:25.909]  The United States has always brain-drained people, and we were seen as the best country in the world, and we still are in many ways.
[00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:35.869]  Everybody wanted to come here, and there was a lamenting around the world, whether they came from Europe or Asia or Latin America or Africa or wherever, that the best people tried to come here.
[00:47:35.969 --> 00:47:38.090]  We're under globalism and the left and replacement migration.
[00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:45.769]  They want the mentally ill, the criminals, the handicapped to weigh down the country and bankrupt it.
[00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:47.550]  I mean, what is it?
[00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:49.309]  Admittedly, just only legal aliens a year.
[00:47:49.610 --> 00:48:01.130]  The last number was $45 billion was spent in 2023 just federally on servicing the tens of millions of illegal aliens that have just gotten here in the last few years on top of all the others.
[00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:03.010]  So it balkanizes the culture.
[00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:04.329]  Most of them become leftist.
[00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:06.389]  They get signed up and indoctrinated.
[00:48:07.259 --> 00:48:09.619]  Musk and Trump and me and you, we want that shutdown.
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:20.260]  And if you look at the graphs, it took Trump a few years, but by his last year, 96% or so cut from the amount of illegals coming across that we saw under Obama.
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:23.400]  Then it more than tripled, almost quadrupled under O'Biden.
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:26.420]  So that's what we voted for Trump for.
[00:48:26.579 --> 00:48:29.260]  And Trump has talked about the abuse of the HB1 system.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:32.960]  There are a lot of folks that really aren't super brains.
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:37.000]  And Americans do get passed over, whether they be black, white, Hispanic.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:44.159]  And they bring in foreigners like Apple and others have settled lawsuits over because they can deport them or take away their visa if they don't like them.
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:45.659]  So they don't have bargaining power.
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:47.179]  And it is used to undercut Americans.
[00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:59.489]  So, Musk has always been for, and he is getting really highly skilled, so he sees that for himself, but he's not backstabbing anybody.
[00:48:59.489 --> 00:49:02.610]  He's not flip-flop, because he's always been for that.
[00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:05.530]  He's a product of the brain drain from the world.
[00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:09.670]  He's a South African by birth, but now an American here.
[00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:16.030]  So, here's some overhead shots of that, and I responded...
[00:49:18.139 --> 00:49:23.719]  Last night, to what Elon Musk had said, saying, you know, it's 0.1%.
[00:49:23.719 --> 00:49:30.300]  It is a classic American policy to brain drain the best from across the planet and bring them here.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.539]  Musk has always advocated for this policy.
[00:49:34.739 --> 00:49:39.260]  Everyone bitching that Elon Musk has flip-flopped are either ignorant or lying.
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:43.260]  Elon, to a great extent, is the poster child for this program working.
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:47.079]  And Elon then responded by...
[00:49:48.409 --> 00:49:51.610]  Here it is right here, saying exactly.
[00:49:53.309 --> 00:49:55.969]  So, that's been his policy.
[00:49:56.489 --> 00:49:58.289]  He said it needs to be reformed.
[00:49:58.409 --> 00:50:00.409]  Trump has said it needs to be reformed and abused.
[00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:03.309]  And I have Trump's statement from 2016 on that.
[00:50:03.469 --> 00:50:06.469]  We have videos of him saying that.
[00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:10.170]  And so this is people splitting hairs.
[00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:12.809]  But what we should know...
[00:50:14.329 --> 00:50:19.210]  Is that the Republican Party still has bluebloods in it, but they're a minority.
[00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:23.889]  But there is a debate between pure libertarians and American firsters in the party.
[00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:34.630]  I am 90% American firster, but I have some understanding that I don't agree with Vivek's kind of hamphysist statement that a lot of Americans are too lazy.
[00:50:34.929 --> 00:50:36.150]  Yeah, there are a lot of lazy Americans.
[00:50:36.289 --> 00:50:38.949]  There's also a lot of really smart engineers and hardworking people that have been undercut.
[00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:40.809]  Who are Americans?
[00:50:40.989 --> 00:50:42.789]  So I think Americans should have priority.
[00:50:42.989 --> 00:50:44.329]  There should be incentives for that.
[00:50:44.469 --> 00:50:48.389]  But obviously if somebody's got 180 IQ, super genius from China or India...
[00:50:49.539 --> 00:51:06.719]  Or a rocket program, and you go look at Elon's people, they're very diverse, and they're all just whoever's the best and gets the job done, and he's taken the space program further in 10 years than it has in the previous 60 or 70. So that's where Elon stands, and he's kind of the laissez-faire libertarian over here.
[00:51:07.179 --> 00:51:08.400]  He said he used to be a Democrat.
[00:51:08.679 --> 00:51:12.480]  I mean, you know, he's helping us overall now, and that's good.
[00:51:12.679 --> 00:51:15.500]  Then you've got the American firsters, and...
[00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:18.190]  The point is we've got to get Trump in.
[00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:19.409]  We've got to stabilize the economy.
[00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:21.010]  We've got to get energy prices down.
[00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:22.329]  We do want to innovate.
[00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:28.210]  But yeah, all these people that really aren't skilled, highly skilled, super skilled, it's being abused.
[00:51:28.429 --> 00:51:32.010]  The HB1 visa program needs to be abused.
[00:51:35.769 --> 00:51:38.590]  Massively curtailed, streamlined, and reformed.
[00:51:38.989 --> 00:51:40.889]  So that's where I am on that.
[00:51:41.429 --> 00:51:43.230]  Harris is going to come in and talk more about that.
[00:51:43.289 --> 00:51:43.809]  But here's an example.
[00:51:44.269 --> 00:51:50.250]  Apple settling claims that illegally favored immigrant workers in hiring practices for $25 million.
[00:51:50.429 --> 00:51:51.309]  And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:52.070]  Yeah.
[00:51:52.389 --> 00:51:53.610]  Are white males targeted?
[00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:55.289]  Are white males bullied in the colleges?
[00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:56.190]  Incredibly bad.
[00:51:56.369 --> 00:52:01.389]  It's worse than even hard to believe until you go to the colleges and see it for yourself.
[00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:04.489]  Is it wrong?
[00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:05.110]  Absolutely.
[00:52:05.429 --> 00:52:12.809]  But is that bleeding over then to blame any immigrant who's super hardworking and intelligent who comes here?
[00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:14.570]  So I get it.
[00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:15.929]  There's a lot of anti-white stuff.
[00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:22.710]  So whites have circled the wagons and are pissed off and are saying nobody until all this anti-white crap stops.
[00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:25.389]  I think that's a reasonable thing to say.
[00:52:25.989 --> 00:52:37.260]  I mean, the left's been so racist and said whites are inherently evil and all that stuff, but that's why I've said why can't you criticize People like Nick Fuentes that become very race-based and say it right back to you, then you freak out about it.
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:42.039]  Well, I mean, he's not saying half of what the ADL and other leftist groups or the Black Lives Matter say.
[00:52:42.219 --> 00:52:44.739]  I mean, they're more Nazi-sounding than the Nazis were.
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:48.579]  So I'm just saying, you're the ones that put us in this arena, left.
[00:52:49.079 --> 00:52:55.099]  And so I'm trying to build a stable, free, open society for everybody, and I love everybody.
[00:52:56.009 --> 00:53:03.570]  But the white guilt needs to end, and the ganging up on white people needs to stop, and white people need to stand up for themselves and say that, and we're doing that, and that's there.
[00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:12.250]  In my view, though, we don't want to then go over the extreme and just start becoming our own cult here.
[00:53:12.929 --> 00:53:14.289]  But the Republican Party's not a cult now.
[00:53:14.289 --> 00:53:15.329]  It's an open, free debate.
[00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:17.309]  You see that with Vivek and...
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.960]  Everybody else, Rand Paul and Elon and myself and you.
[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:23.099]  And that's what it's about.
[00:53:23.199 --> 00:53:24.940]  That's why I disagree with some stuff Harrison's saying.
[00:53:25.019 --> 00:53:25.639]  I agree with most of it.
[00:53:25.699 --> 00:53:26.699]  We have discussions.
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.019]  Harrison's coming up.
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:29.199]  More straight ahead.
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:29.880]  Please stay with me.
[00:53:30.869 --> 00:53:31.989]  It's time to take action.
[00:53:32.329 --> 00:53:38.170]  So for a lot of you out there, this is free and you can make supplemental money very easily.
[00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:41.630]  I mean, I would imagine most people can make hundreds of bucks a month with their eyes closed.
[00:53:41.849 --> 00:53:47.550]  And if you really kick ass, thousands of dollars, even if you have a tiny, you know, X account or Facebook or whatever.
[00:53:47.849 --> 00:53:56.250]  But if you're a talk show host, I mean, you can make a living and finance your show and maybe even, you know, hire reporters or whatever.
[00:53:56.389 --> 00:53:57.670]  I mean, this is exciting.
[00:54:01.019 --> 00:54:05.079]  And one other thing, there are five limited edition fundraiser posters.
[00:54:05.239 --> 00:54:07.019]  And by fundraiser, everything raises funds there.
[00:54:07.099 --> 00:54:10.719]  But the t-shirts cost like 16, 17 bucks a piece before you buy them.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:13.400]  And then the sponsor gets half and we get half.
[00:54:13.519 --> 00:54:17.840]  And to run all this and build a new network as a backup, you know, we're squeaking by.
[00:54:18.039 --> 00:54:24.880]  But when something says fundraiser on it, like a t-shirt that's cost double or a poster, yeah, the poster costs five, six bucks.
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.659]  I mean, the shipping we ship it in, the special packaging costs as much as the poster itself.
[00:54:29.219 --> 00:54:32.900]  So we're, you know, six, seven, eight, nine bucks for the poster cost with the packaging.
[00:54:33.059 --> 00:54:35.099]  And then we're selling it for 25, 30 bucks.
[00:54:35.219 --> 00:54:37.019]  That's because there's some real markup in there to fund it.
[00:54:37.079 --> 00:54:38.440]  So you know you're buying something.
[00:54:38.599 --> 00:54:40.780]  There's a memento that you really back what we're doing.
[00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:44.579]  The campaign coins, challenge coins, they're all there.
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:49.039]  So the posters run from $19.95 to $29.95.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:52.119]  And we'll have new limited edition posters after that.
[00:54:52.619 --> 00:54:57.960]  But the posters on January 6th will be no more.
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:03.559]  They're limited edition, so if you get your order in by then, you will get the poster because they're print on demand.
[00:55:03.559 --> 00:55:04.219]  They're in Arkansas.
[00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:07.000]  If you want one of these posters, there they are.
[00:55:07.519 --> 00:55:11.400]  And again, you've got until January 6th to get your order in.
[00:55:11.539 --> 00:55:12.760]  They look great hanging on the wall.
[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:14.480]  We got them hanging here in Arkansas.
[00:55:14.519 --> 00:55:15.039]  The office.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.440]  And I designed all of these.
[00:55:17.619 --> 00:55:22.900]  My favorite is the Trump graph that I showed the day before the election that predicted the election.
[00:55:23.039 --> 00:55:25.079]  I said, she's going to try to steal it, but it's going to fail.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:30.320]  So the blue line goes up, it goes straight up, but it's not enough fraud to overpower the landslide.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.480]  And that's actually the graph that actually happened.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:33.960]  The key battlegrounds.
[00:55:34.159 --> 00:55:35.900]  So you talk about nailing it, baby.
[00:55:36.219 --> 00:55:37.099]  That's my favorite.
[00:55:37.219 --> 00:55:38.039]  I designed that one.
[00:55:38.199 --> 00:55:40.340]  And then the 47th one I designed as well.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.579]  So I designed those.
[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:44.519]  I did not design the Darkest Hour one, but there it is.
[00:55:44.639 --> 00:55:45.320]  Thank you for the support.
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:46.000]  I'm done plugging.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:56.739]  I've just been looking at all the attacks and our victories in court, and I realized how much money it takes to take these people on, and they are so pissed we're still on air, and I have hired high-powered lawyers.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:08.000]  That's why we're winning, and they take My lawyers are working seven days a week.
[00:56:08.699 --> 00:56:10.199]  I go and meet with them almost every day.
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:13.980]  They call me at midnight and say, come to the office, I want you to read this, sign it, make sure it's accurate.
[00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:22.780]  If I told you all the suits we filed on and all the crap we're doing to bloom, to the whole deep state, because I can't be on defense anymore.
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:23.539]  I've got to go on offense.
[00:56:24.179 --> 00:56:25.619]  It would take an hour to go over it all.
[00:56:26.659 --> 00:56:28.559]  But you want me to fight, I'm fighting.
[00:56:29.559 --> 00:56:29.880]  So...
[00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:32.630]  You're financing the current operation.
[00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:35.090]  You're financing the back of Alex Jones Network if we get shut down.
[00:56:35.289 --> 00:56:38.630]  And that's still getting built and expanded, not a larger studio.
[00:56:38.949 --> 00:56:39.630]  Almost done.
[00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:42.750]  And you're financing the legal defense and offense.
[00:56:42.969 --> 00:56:43.909]  I mean, this is a war.
[00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:45.090]  You want somebody to fight for you?
[00:56:45.269 --> 00:56:46.489]  I love it.
[00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:49.849]  I mean, I'm begging for you to keep me in the game, keep me in the fight, Coach.
[00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:51.449]  But I'm here, you're serving.
[00:56:51.809 --> 00:56:52.809]  You commissioned me.
[00:56:53.849 --> 00:56:59.769]  Look, I won't stop regardless of what happens, but I'm asking you to empower me, and I will give you everything I got.
[00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:06.469]  I'm so focused right now and so sick of this crap and the stuff that I've been doing to my family behind the scenes, just absolutely criminal.
[00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:09.789]  And so all I'm asking for is the support to keep fighting.
[00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:11.750]  And we make it easy with incredible products.
[00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:12.469]  Okay, I'm done.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:50.639]  Waging war on corruption, crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:57:50.679 --> 00:57:56.260]  I am your host, Alex Jones, on this live Friday, December 27th, 2024 broadcast.
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:57.880]  All right.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:09.599]  I want to hit this tronch of news right now and then come back and get into a bunch of other really important health news and some of the positive things, really insanely positive developments that are happening.
[00:58:09.679 --> 00:58:10.940]  But first, let's look at the bad news.
[00:58:11.059 --> 00:58:12.519]  But it's also good news because we know now.
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:13.840]  Look at these headlines.
[00:58:15.159 --> 00:58:19.659]  CDC data could signal start a pandemic winter wave.
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:28.139]  USA Today, just like clockwork, Trump will have a new pandemic or pandemics cave in on his administration, Hotez said, three weeks ago.
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:31.559]  Dr. Malone, we're going to get him on this week or next week.
[00:58:32.539 --> 00:58:34.559]  Dr. Malone, this is on Infowars.com.
[00:58:34.679 --> 00:58:38.440]  Bird flu emergency in California is a case of psychological bioterrorism.
[00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:50.829]  To kill a bunch of cows and chickens, create fear, declare an emergency so that other blue cities and states can do it as we predicted they would do and as they are now doing it.
[00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:52.789]  This is how they want to maintain control.
[00:58:53.050 --> 00:59:03.190]  They tried to pass the bill a week and a half ago to give themselves draconian powers similar to the UN treaty, but it failed as well thanks to you and Elon Musk rallying the people and Infowars rallying them.
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:07.019]  Here's another report.
[00:59:07.159 --> 00:59:08.760]  I'm not going to play it, but it's amazing.
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:09.940]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:20.639]  The CDC is now saying there have been enough cases of people who have had the vaccine, received the vaccine, and then suffered a stroke to admit it's causing strokes, heart attacks, myocarditis, blood clots.
[00:59:20.719 --> 00:59:21.360]  Well, we already knew that.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:33.820]  They predicted it in October of 2020. The FDA had a working group list of probable adverse reactions, including all of that, infertility, turbo cancer, and more.
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:34.739]  But now...
[00:59:35.559 --> 00:59:39.019]  Years and years and years and years later, after we've hammered it, they're admitting it.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.500]  And look at this.
[00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:46.179]  FBI found evidence COVID was lab leaked but was not allowed to brief the president.
[00:59:46.639 --> 00:59:54.000]  The FBI said it was man-made and they knew day one, but they were never allowed to tell the president because of their bosses.
[00:59:55.519 --> 01:00:06.130]  We knew in February of 2020, for major universities in India and Australia that scanned the virus with the CRISPR system, And the U.S. has more CRISPRs than anybody.
[01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:08.309]  That it was man-made.
[01:00:08.469 --> 01:00:10.570]  Five viruses, a chimeric virus combined.
[01:00:11.309 --> 01:00:12.869]  And then now, here it is.
[01:00:12.949 --> 01:00:13.610]  London Telegraph.
[01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:17.869]  FBI found evidence COVID lab leak was not allowed to brief the president.
[01:00:18.389 --> 01:00:26.590]  The head of the FBI's program, the doctor of microbiology and former senior scientist, the FBI, has declared that more of a year of his life to discover the origins.
[01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:27.250]  Oh, yeah, right.
[01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:31.230]  FBI not allowed to brief Biden on COVID Lab League.
[01:00:31.389 --> 01:00:32.590]  Oh, Biden didn't know.
[01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:36.230]  They're now in the cover their ass mode.
[01:00:36.429 --> 01:00:52.710]  Meanwhile, long COVID study shows high rates of cognitive damage because it's a nanotech synthetic version of the HIV highly toxic self-replicating spike protein and creates protein clusters, as I told you four and a half years ago.
[01:00:53.619 --> 01:01:02.860]  In the brain, prions, a synthetic form of spongiform encephalophathy, also known as mad cow disease.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.280]  Vindicated again.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.619]  That's in a major, two new major studies.
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:12.099]  Read the details at...
[01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:16.949]  The CDC's own website and the National Institutes of Health.
[01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:23.210]  And don't forget, three months ago, the FDA came out and said, turns out fluoride does lower your IQ and cause cancer and infertility.
[01:01:23.289 --> 01:01:25.090]  Oh, wow, they knew that back when they did it.
[01:01:25.889 --> 01:01:27.369]  This is a plan.
[01:01:27.869 --> 01:01:29.630]  This is a operation.
[01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:33.829]  We're going to go to break for one minute, join a bunch of stations.
[01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:37.289]  After that, and people on X are like, why does he have breaks?
[01:01:37.409 --> 01:01:39.150]  Well, we have half the breaks of other radio shows.
[01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:40.130]  We're a TV show.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:52.239]  On the radio, I've been on radio for 30 years, almost 30, been on air, 31 in April, but 29 years on air on radio, and we're still on a bunch of radio stations, so we have the ads.
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:57.840]  We don't play our network ads, and you see our network ads played over the local ads, but that's how networks work.
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:00.500]  When you watch the NFL, you see national ads, you see your local ads.
[01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:05.210]  We're on those great stations, and that's how we were able to stay on air when they took me off the internet, basically.
[01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:07.769]  Six years ago was because of the AM and FM stations.
[01:02:07.909 --> 01:02:08.469]  We're very, very thankful.
[01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:09.969]  Be sure and support them.
[01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:16.929]  But whatever you do, follow me on X at Real Alex Jones, and in case they shut down InfoWars next month, at AJNLive on X. So critical.
[01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:19.150]  Follow me now at AJNLive.
[01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:20.309]  Everybody you know, follow us as well.
[01:02:20.409 --> 01:02:20.809]  We'll be right back.
[01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:26.449]  With more amazing health news, some really positive developments.
[01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:26.929]  Stay with us.
[01:02:40.579 --> 01:02:45.360]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[01:02:45.719 --> 01:02:50.239]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:03:00.480]  We're now well into our number two of this live Friday, December 27th, 2024 broadcast.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:12.500]  If you just joined us, the Democrats, the party, Jamie Raskin, all of them are officially moving in Congress to block the certification of President Trump as the 47th president on January 6th.
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:17.500]  They're writing op-eds everywhere, lying and saying he's convicted of insurrection when he never was.
[01:03:17.699 --> 01:03:21.679]  They are treating you like you have a 70 IQ, room temperature.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:22.840]  Amazing.
[01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:26.190]  But I wanted to talk about some of the positive news.
[01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:49.670]  To try to take control of the Trump administration and at least shut down blue cities and states to stymie a recovery.
[01:03:49.929 --> 01:03:52.230]  The bureaucrats in Europe are doing the same thing.
[01:03:52.369 --> 01:03:54.750]  Australia, New Zealand, because what did they say decades ago?
[01:03:54.849 --> 01:04:05.429]  The UN, the globalists, WF said, we'll use the threat of viruses and the fear to shut down economies for the effect of carbon shutdowns, carbon lockdowns.
[01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:08.510]  Oh, this was really a carbon lockdown, King Charles said.
[01:04:08.869 --> 01:04:12.610]  This is really a carbon lockdown, said Klaus Schwab.
[01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:29.030]  And I told you before they said that, these are really carbon lockdowns, because they'd war game previously, that locking everybody down for viruses, supposedly, was a good way to start training you that you can only leave your house when we say, or drive your car when we say, or have a car when we say, and eat the bugs when we say, own nothing and be happy.
[01:04:29.429 --> 01:04:31.610]  Well, we're not happy and we're not going along with it.
[01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:42.409]  So we're about to hit some really positive news on this front with RFK Jr. set to get confirmed as the head of HHS and really taking action.
[01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:44.510]  And he said Trump has taken the gloves off.
[01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:47.550]  This is a big part of stopping the globalists.
[01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:50.710]  It's making America and the world healthy again.
[01:04:50.909 --> 01:04:52.449]  Make America healthy again.
[01:04:54.389 --> 01:05:05.130]  The way we continue to make America and the world healthy is first mentally and spiritually with the truth so people know what's really going on and so they know that they're not alone in the fight against tyranny as we completely turn the tide.
[01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:07.309]  So, be healthy.

[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:48.380]  I'm driving around a little bit.
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:51.639]  So, thealexjohnestore.com.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:56.539]  And January 6th is the last day for the five collectible fundraiser posters.
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:02.860]  As a memento that you've been at the tip of the spear in the Infowar, and they've got some good markup, unlike the other products.
[01:08:03.219 --> 01:08:07.079]  We sell a lot, but there's not a huge markup in the T-shirts and supplements.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.719]  These have good markup in them, so we actually make some money.
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:16.760]  So if you really want to help us stay on the air and fight the globalists in our lawsuits against the deep state and all of them, and we're winning them, then get these collectible posters.

[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:22.760]  We'll come up with some new limited editions, but this is it for these amazing posters.
[01:08:22.859 --> 01:08:24.020]  I want to thank all of you that have gotten them.
[01:08:24.079 --> 01:08:24.920]  I want to encourage those that haven't.
[01:08:25.079 --> 01:08:28.020]  Get yours now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:08:28.369 --> 01:08:33.890]  Okay, here is Robert F. Kennedy saying we must fire FTE workers who don't protect us.
[01:08:34.050 --> 01:08:38.949]  And then other citizen journalists making very accurate on target points.
[01:08:39.090 --> 01:08:40.829]  But we're in the middle of this health revolution.
[01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:42.310]  It's happening.
[01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:44.569]  They're already pulling seed oils out of a bunch of the foods.
[01:08:44.729 --> 01:08:46.090]  They're already pulling fluoride out of things.
[01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:56.810]  They're already going in and pulling out the red dye without even a law, all because we're pushing back and people are becoming aware of this and we're aware of the poison shots and we're aware of the 5G and we're just aware of the glyphosate.
[01:08:57.130 --> 01:08:58.789]  This is how they've been killing us.
[01:08:59.149 --> 01:09:00.409]  And it's so exciting.
[01:09:00.609 --> 01:09:04.810]  So here's these important clips and I'll be right back with more news and Harrison Smith straight ahead.
[01:09:05.559 --> 01:09:14.720]  Clearing out the corruption in your terms, would that mean clearing out the top-level federal service workers that are currently at the FDA and CDC? In some categories, I would say.
[01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:15.500]  What does that look like?
[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:24.659]  In some categories of workers, there are entire departments, like the nutrition departments at FDA, that have to go.
[01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:28.729]  That are not doing their job.
[01:09:28.869 --> 01:09:30.210]  They're not protecting our kids.
[01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:36.989]  Why do we have Froot Loops in this country that have 18 or 19 ingredients and you go to Canada and it's got two or three?
[01:09:37.210 --> 01:09:38.710]  Would you eliminate any of the agencies?
[01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:47.329]  To eliminate the agencies, as long as it requires congressional approval, I wouldn't be doing that.
[01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:50.069]  I can get the corruption out of the agencies.
[01:09:50.069 --> 01:09:51.949]  That's what I've been doing for 40 years.
[01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:53.689]  I've sued all those agencies.
[01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:56.810]  I have a PhD in corporate corruption, and that's what I do.
[01:09:56.970 --> 01:10:04.170]  And once they're not corrupt, Once Americans are getting good science and are allowed to make their own choices, they're going to get a lot healthier.
[01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:07.970]  Heads up, my friends, these big food companies are getting slicker and slicker.
[01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:12.529]  They have changed the name of aspartame in food ingredients to amino-sweet.
[01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:20.170]  So if you're like me and want to stay away from artificial sweeteners and artificial things in your food, look for that amino-sweet in the labeling.
[01:10:20.449 --> 01:10:27.270]  Another little helpful hint, it's also manufactured by the same people that manufacture glyphosate, DBT, saccharin.
[01:10:27.569 --> 01:10:29.250]  Also things I try to stay away from.
[01:10:29.710 --> 01:10:30.909]  Stay awake out there!
[01:10:31.369 --> 01:10:36.510]  If I told you that my child was injured in a car accident, you would be so compassionate and worried.
[01:10:37.449 --> 01:10:41.850]  If I told you it was because the brakes had failed, you would be so shocked and appalled.
[01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:52.670]  If I told you that I found out that the manufacturers decided not to bother testing the brakes, you would be infuriated and tell me to sue them.
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:11:03.239]  If I told you that I found 60 studies that showed that they would fail but they opted to cover it up instead your head would be spinning.
[01:11:03.779 --> 01:11:24.869]  If I further told you that the government knew all about the dangers and that there were laws passed preventing anyone from being able to sue those manufacturers and that there were hundreds of thousands of injured and killed children Due to that negligence,
[01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:30.829]  you would be so beyond yourself in trying to find any way possible to help these kids.
[01:11:31.729 --> 01:11:35.010]  Now replace the word car with vaccine.
[01:11:36.109 --> 01:11:37.489]  How does it make you feel?
[01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:40.770]  Because this is a very real thing.
[01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:46.170]  There are millions of parents out there fighting every single day for their voices to be heard.
[01:11:46.789 --> 01:11:49.010]  The evidence is beyond question.
[01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:57.340]  These vaccines have not been properly tested, and there are hundreds of studies connecting the vaccines and these injuries.
[01:11:58.279 --> 01:12:00.979]  It's a tough pill to swallow, but you need to start listening.
[01:12:01.319 --> 01:12:03.880]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas.
[01:12:04.039 --> 01:12:16.939]  U.S. resistance against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big mega banks that set up Communist China in 1949. The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.
[01:12:17.439 --> 01:12:19.180]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[01:12:19.449 --> 01:12:21.550]  The Communist Chinese have to control the main universities.
[01:12:21.789 --> 01:12:22.930]  This is all confirmed.
[01:12:23.109 --> 01:12:23.909]  This is not a drill.
[01:12:24.109 --> 01:12:27.989]  Big tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:29.710]  They've officially become state run.
[01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:30.869]  Apple 100%.
[01:12:30.869 --> 01:12:36.250]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship.
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:41.640]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones to do that.
[01:12:41.859 --> 01:12:42.779]  This is happening.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:50.779]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:56.800]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:04.880]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[01:13:05.779 --> 01:13:09.500]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:13.020]  We adapt to being oppressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:23.340]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:28.539]  Total Internet of Things, integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[01:13:28.739 --> 01:13:48.850]  It is the virtual reality AI. I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering,
[01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:50.069]  ramming it out as much as I can.
[01:13:50.899 --> 01:13:59.880]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[01:13:59.979 --> 01:14:04.779]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[01:14:10.539 --> 01:14:18.060]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[01:14:18.439 --> 01:14:25.140]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:31.100]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and is being used against you.
[01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:32.819]  Only your full understanding of this.
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.880]  He will break you free from this paradigm.
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.000]  I have given you the transmission.
[01:14:38.319 --> 01:14:39.180]  Now break free!
[01:14:42.609 --> 01:14:51.750]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:58.810]  Thomas Jefferson If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:08.859]  Patriot Apparel, the supplements at the yellowstonestore.com do not have a lot of markup because we're being very competitive and it's critical to funding our operation.
[01:15:09.359 --> 01:15:18.119]  But we do have limited edition posters that do have a lot of markup in them so that if you really want to support or keep us on the air, you can go buy the products.
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:24.899]  Now, there are currently five limited-edition posters, and on January 6th, we're not going to make any more of these designs.
[01:15:25.079 --> 01:15:35.079]  So if you want to get them, hang them on the wall, hang them at your office, know that you really supported the InfoWare at a critical time, and know that we really got some major funds in from it, because the posters cost like $6, $7 a piece.
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:37.859]  We sell them for $25, $29, depending on the poster.
[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:46.779]  Again, it's a fundraiser, so you know you're really supported, but they're handsome, nice posters, and they're mementos of the Battle for the Republic in 1776 worldwide.
[01:15:46.939 --> 01:15:52.659]  So you've only got to January 6th to get these five limited edition posters, and they'll never be available again.
[01:15:52.899 --> 01:15:55.100]  I've got them hanging at my home and here at the office.
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:56.159]  I love them.
[01:15:56.260 --> 01:16:00.899]  So get your limited edition posters right now at thealexjonesstore.com while you can.
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:07.100]  Alright, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:07.539 --> 01:16:08.859]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:09.039 --> 01:16:13.300]  I'm Harrison Smith, sitting in for Alex this Friday, December 27th.
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.340]  I'll be with you until 2 p.m.
[01:16:16.109 --> 01:16:21.289]  A little over an hour and a half, in which time I'll be handing it off to Jay Dyer, the great Jay Dyer.
[01:16:21.970 --> 01:16:24.310]  And we have a lot to talk about today.
[01:16:24.689 --> 01:16:28.670]  And I imagine I'm going to open up the phone lines for your calls in the next hour.
[01:16:28.789 --> 01:16:30.149]  From 1 to 2, we'll take your calls.
[01:16:30.609 --> 01:16:38.189]  Especially on the topic that has absolutely dominated X over the last 48 to 72 hours.
[01:16:38.409 --> 01:16:40.350]  I don't think I've ever seen anything like this.
[01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:48.810]  Every once in a while, in fact, it's a pretty regular occurrence, about once a month, some topic sort of dominates X for a little bit.
[01:16:48.909 --> 01:16:50.050]  You kind of can't escape it.
[01:16:50.109 --> 01:16:52.630]  You just have to endure it for a few days.
[01:16:52.789 --> 01:16:54.930]  And it's like a cyclical thing, right?
[01:16:55.149 --> 01:16:57.310]  You sort of ignore it, but you keep seeing takes.
[01:16:57.430 --> 01:17:00.170]  You keep seeing takes and eventually think, all right, I better hop in on this.
[01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:02.090]  And then that just prolongs it for that much longer.
[01:17:03.239 --> 01:17:06.899]  But it's usually just one of many things being discussed at one time.
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:16.640]  The H-1B visa debate has been the only thing anybody has talked about on X for the last 48 hours.
[01:17:16.899 --> 01:17:17.380]  Like, that's it.
[01:17:17.439 --> 01:17:19.500]  It's the only thing anybody is posting about.
[01:17:19.699 --> 01:17:20.659]  It is wild.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:27.300]  I've never seen anything absolutely dominate the social media landscape like this has, and for good reason.
[01:17:27.779 --> 01:17:38.829]  First of all, We're good to go.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:53.380]  Well, since it got started, it sort of dragged in a bunch of other topics that we discuss on a regular basis.
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:59.600]  Immigration overall, but also censorship now being levied against people on the wrong side of this debate.
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:04.880]  Even Owen Schroer had his verified badge taken away and is now under review.
[01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:15.060]  And this has happened to several hundred people and several dozen very high-profile people have suddenly found that their verification badge is no longer there.
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:18.359]  And they're wondering why that is or who made that decision.
[01:18:24.409 --> 01:18:25.810]  We're good to go.
[01:18:36.810 --> 01:18:41.649]  We're good to go.
[01:18:41.649 --> 01:18:50.850]  We're good to go.
[01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:59.289]  Bring down the ban hammer and the account would be gone and you wouldn't be able to hear from them anymore.
[01:18:59.409 --> 01:19:00.069]  And that would be that.
[01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:12.729]  And I think they realized, partly because of Alex Jones' and Infowars' success in overcoming that type of censorship and the Streisand effect, causing more people to seek out the people that were banned.
[01:19:12.850 --> 01:19:16.850]  I think they figured out that, okay, banning people outright is sort of counterproductive.
[01:19:16.909 --> 01:19:19.069]  So instead, we need soft censorship.
[01:19:19.329 --> 01:19:23.390]  We need censorship that isn't quite as obvious and not quite as knowable.
[01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:31.949]  So you'll still think that you have a platform, you're able to speak, but your reach will be limited and you won't really be able to tell.
[01:19:31.949 --> 01:19:41.130]  It'll just seem to you like your ideas aren't quite as popular maybe as they used to be, when in reality they're just not being presented to as many people as they once were.
[01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:45.689]  And that's just one of a number of topics that I think relate to all of this.
[01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:49.510]  And Alex has talked a little bit about it on the show earlier today.
[01:19:49.789 --> 01:20:05.350]  And of course, We're good to go.
[01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:19.970]  Which, of course, means everybody except white Christian males, more or less.
[01:20:20.210 --> 01:20:20.829]  Very diverse.
[01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:26.210]  Of course, the classic image is you'll see a picture of a boardroom, and it's all black women.
[01:20:26.210 --> 01:20:27.710]  And they're like, it's so diverse.
[01:20:27.710 --> 01:20:29.569]  It's 100% diverse.
[01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:32.869]  It's like, that's not what that word means, actually.
[01:20:32.869 --> 01:20:34.149]  That is the opposite of diverse.
[01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:37.270]  That is uniform and monolithic.
[01:20:38.279 --> 01:20:54.699]  So the way these words are used, the way the language and argumentation sort of spirals out of control, it's all very interesting and pertinent as we look around the world today and we see the methods that the globalists are using to divide and conquer, which I think is exactly what's going on here.
[01:20:56.119 --> 01:20:57.439]  It's been fascinating.
[01:20:57.439 --> 01:20:58.399]  It's been very interesting.
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:03.779]  And if you're not on X, or if you just occasionally peruse X and aren't on there continuously...
[01:21:05.039 --> 01:21:09.060]  Like, my dad yesterday, you know, was just like, what's up with this H-1B thing?
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:12.079]  I'm just like, oh, well, how much time do you have?
[01:21:12.279 --> 01:21:13.560]  Where do you want to start?
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:14.600]  What do you want to know?
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:20.260]  Because the whole thing is a very tangled mess, and I do want to attempt to untangle it.
[01:21:20.399 --> 01:21:28.560]  But I want to sort of start by thanking Alex Jones for giving me this platform, because I've said it a million times, but it's worth reemphasizing.
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.680]  I have never been told what to say.
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:42.579]  There's been one time in the four-plus years, in fact, we're coming up on the fourth anniversary of the American Journal, the morning show that I do here on Infowars.
[01:21:42.739 --> 01:21:47.119]  There's one time in that entire four-year run that Alex Jones has...
[01:21:49.059 --> 01:21:50.819]  What to cover, how to cover something.
[01:21:51.159 --> 01:21:58.100]  And it was at the outbreak of the Ukraine war, he simply sent a message to Owen and I just saying, don't be flippant about this.
[01:21:58.199 --> 01:21:58.760]  This is war.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:21:59.579]  This is serious.
[01:21:59.979 --> 01:22:01.020]  Just treat it seriously.
[01:22:01.239 --> 01:22:01.800]  And that was it.
[01:22:02.119 --> 01:22:04.119]  And it was more advice rather than an order.
[01:22:04.159 --> 01:22:06.359]  And it wasn't you have to cover it this way and you have to cover it this way.
[01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:08.939]  It was just don't take this flippantly.
[01:22:09.159 --> 01:22:09.899]  This is war.
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:10.659]  This is serious.
[01:22:11.079 --> 01:22:12.600]  Treat it with the seriousness it deserves.
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:13.899]  People's lives are on the line.
[01:22:14.539 --> 01:22:15.079]  And that's it.
[01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:17.699]  I mean, in four years, that is the only direction I've gotten.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:27.960]  And it reminds me of the first day that I got to InfoWars, seven years ago, when I heard Owen Schroer talking to Alex Jones and saying, you know, I think I'm going to cover this.
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:28.899]  I think I'm going to cover it this way.
[01:22:28.979 --> 01:22:31.100]  And Alex just said, say whatever you want, just tell the truth.
[01:22:31.619 --> 01:22:32.300]  And that was it.
[01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:39.819]  And that's sort of the motto I've gone with and the mindset I've gone into every broadcast with.
[01:22:40.609 --> 01:22:41.649]  I'm allowed to say whatever I want.
[01:22:41.789 --> 01:22:42.810]  I just have to tell the truth.
[01:22:42.829 --> 01:22:52.670]  And I have this incredible platform that I take very seriously and that I attempt to treat with the respect it deserves and not take any of this flippantly.
[01:22:52.810 --> 01:23:03.390]  As I know, there are millions of people watching us every day and depend on us for giving them some semblance of truth in a world just beset continuously by lies.
[01:23:05.039 --> 01:23:21.760]  And so we're going to talk about the H-1B scandal on X over the last few days, and I'll try to break down sort of where the divergence comes from, because what it reminds me of is things like the gun control debate,
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:32.279]  where We're good to go.
[01:23:46.439 --> 01:23:55.800]  Are committed with pistols, and yet you're using that number to go after assault rifles, which more people are killed by hammers than assault rifles on any given year.
[01:23:56.199 --> 01:23:59.479]  So it's, you know, what's the classic phrase?
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.340]  Statistics don't lie, but liars use statistics.
[01:24:01.579 --> 01:24:09.500]  I think there's some aspect of that going on here where they're talking about H-1B visas, which we've known for years.
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:35.100]  And I'll show you clips from the 2016 presidential debate before Trump Was even the nominee for the Republicans when he's debating with Marco Rubio talking about H1B visas and how these things are abused continuously by massive corporations for the sole and overriding purpose of paying people less and having what amounts to indentured servitude by bringing in foreigners who have to work for a very low pay,
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:39.859]  have to work insanely long hours, and if they refuse, get sent back to their home country.
[01:24:39.979 --> 01:24:41.399]  It's a form of indentured servitude.
[01:24:45.780 --> 01:25:01.739]  We're good to go.
[01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:14.250]  Kind of similarly to the way you can conflate gun death statistics overall to try to get your gun control on assault rifles passed.
[01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:15.869]  It's all a little bit conflated.
[01:25:16.050 --> 01:25:17.569]  I'll try to get to the bottom of it.
[01:25:17.649 --> 01:25:23.250]  I'll try to lay it out for people that have not been embroiled in this controversy for the last 48 hours.
[01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:28.489]  And hopefully we can heal the wounds that have now been made apparent in the MAGA side.
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:36.159]  Patriot Apparel, the supplements, the yellowstonestore.com do not have a lot of markup because we're being very competitive and it's critical to funding our operation.
[01:25:36.619 --> 01:25:45.399]  But we do have limited edition posters that do have a lot of markup in them so that if you really want to support or keep us on the air, you can go buy the products.
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:52.199]  Now, there are currently five limited-edition posters, and on January 6th, we're not going to make any more of these designs.
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:26:02.380]  So if you want to get them, hang them on the wall, hang them at your office, know that you really supported the InfoWare at a critical time, and know that we really got some major funds in from it, because the posters cost like $6, $7 a piece.
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:05.199]  We sell them for $25, $29 depending on the poster.
[01:26:05.739 --> 01:26:14.079]  Again, it's a fundraiser, so you know you're really supported, but they're handsome, nice posters, and they're mementos of the battle for the Republic in 1776 worldwide.
[01:26:14.279 --> 01:26:19.960]  So you've only got to January 6th to get these five limited edition posters, and they'll never be available again.
[01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:22.399]  I've got them hanging at my home and here at the office.
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:23.460]  I love them.
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:28.220]  So get your limited edition posters right now at thealexjonesstore.com while you can.
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:34.460]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to this live Friday edition of The Alex Jones Show.
[01:26:34.619 --> 01:26:35.539]  I'm Harrison Smith.
[01:26:36.279 --> 01:26:39.420]  Sitting in for Alex Jones for the next hour and a half.
[01:26:39.579 --> 01:26:41.920]  And then I'll hand the baton over to Jay Dyer.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.960]  And I also want to open up the phone lines for your calls in the next hour.
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:50.479]  Probably mostly to talk about the MAGA Civil War.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:51.859]  At least that's what it's being called.
[01:26:51.979 --> 01:26:53.380]  Axios has an article.
[01:26:53.579 --> 01:26:58.680]  MAGA Civil War breaks out over American mediocrity culture.
[01:26:59.239 --> 01:27:04.180]  This relating to the post by Vivek Ramaswamy.
[01:27:05.529 --> 01:27:07.630]  And I'm not going to spend the whole show on this.
[01:27:07.729 --> 01:27:20.609]  There's a lot of other big news as well, including a revelation from the New York Post about spy bosses having silenced the Defense Department and FBI scientists from briefing Biden on the COVID lab leak evidence.
[01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:27.770]  There's also big moves in Europe as Germany's president dissolves their parliament and calls snap elections.
[01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:32.090]  This, of course, in response to the rise of right-wing politics.
[01:27:35.190 --> 01:27:37.210]  We're good to go.
[01:27:48.539 --> 01:27:55.039]  By Congress to block Donald Trump from taking office and the ex-NATO boss being made head of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:27:55.199 --> 01:28:05.199]  So major, major stories happening around the world when it comes to the quiet war being waged between nationalism and globalism.
[01:28:05.359 --> 01:28:15.239]  And that is the division, the division that Alex Jones identified long ago and so accurately laid out for all of humanity.
[01:28:15.239 --> 01:28:17.000]  And this is, again, a...
[01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:20.529]  It is a conflict between...
[01:28:20.529 --> 01:28:36.029]  When it gets to the H-1B visas, I see it as a conflict as to the very foundation of your views of what a nation is, what its purpose is, how and why such things as nations even exist.
[01:28:36.609 --> 01:28:38.170]  What is the point of a nation?
[01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:41.090]  And is it just to be an economic zone?
[01:28:41.229 --> 01:28:45.710]  Is it a sports team, as Elon Musk calls it, or is it a family and a home?
[01:28:49.710 --> 01:28:55.489]  We're good to go.
[01:29:04.539 --> 01:29:07.720]  At a whim, depending on how much money they bring in.
[01:29:07.859 --> 01:29:09.479]  A nation is a family.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:10.880]  It's an extended family.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.420]  And this is how nations have existed for all of time.
[01:29:14.539 --> 01:29:20.420]  It's where our concept of government comes from is an extension of the family or the patriarchy or whatever you want to call it.
[01:29:21.609 --> 01:29:32.829]  And when you think about it that way, a lot of these claims are absurd from the people who think that the GDP is the greatest way to judge the success or failure of a country.
[01:29:32.970 --> 01:29:35.270]  You would never do that for your family.
[01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:45.149]  I would never replace my children that my wife gave birth to with immigrant children because they bring more money to the household.
[01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:46.250]  That is crazy.
[01:29:46.279 --> 01:29:48.920]  A heartless and absurd way to behave, wouldn't it be?
[01:29:49.039 --> 01:29:49.979]  I mean, it's outrageous.
[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:51.020]  It would just never happen.
[01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:59.220]  We're not gonna adopt some teenager and get rid of our toddlers because the teenager can work at McDonald's and bring in a couple extra bucks.
[01:29:59.399 --> 01:30:00.819]  That's insane.
[01:30:00.979 --> 01:30:02.560]  That's an insane way to act and behave.
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:11.399]  And that's how I feel a lot of the statements from the likes of Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk have come across.
[01:30:11.579 --> 01:30:17.199]  And again, I like these guys for everything they've done for us.
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:18.960]  I will be forever thankful.
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.979]  I have my Twitter account back.
[01:30:21.159 --> 01:30:27.739]  My ex-account exists now because Elon Musk rolled back the censorship that was taking place on Twitter.
[01:30:27.979 --> 01:30:29.739]  And how could we not appreciate that?
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:34.060]  And his help to get Trump over the finish line, I think, was very necessary.
[01:30:34.279 --> 01:30:41.300]  And we might not have an incoming Trump administration if Elon Musk had not done what he did.
[01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:44.060]  So it's not too, you know...
[01:30:44.670 --> 01:30:47.770]  Throw these guys under the bus or throw the baby out with the bathwater.
[01:30:48.930 --> 01:30:52.170]  But this is what we've wanted.
[01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:53.770]  This is why you don't have censorship.
[01:30:53.770 --> 01:30:55.229]  So you can have these conversations.
[01:30:55.229 --> 01:30:56.470]  So you can make these arguments.
[01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:59.810]  So you can have these real debates about real things that matter.
[01:31:00.050 --> 01:31:09.560]  Hear from all sides and not Destroy people for their views or decide that one view is the right and the other view is racist or something.
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:18.800]  And that's one of the things that's been happening in response to a lot of people just saying they don't want to be competing with a worldwide labor pool.
[01:31:19.949 --> 01:31:26.090]  Because it's America, we don't have an option to go anywhere else, and we wouldn't want to go anywhere else anyway.
[01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:43.489]  And yet, we are now expected to compete in a worldwide market with people who have much lower living standards, who come from cultures where they'll work 12, 14 hours a day, seven days a week, and live in a very small,
[01:31:43.729 --> 01:31:48.430]  not very well-furnished apartment in Mumbai or something.
[01:31:49.329 --> 01:31:57.409]  If you give those people a one-room apartment in San Francisco to somebody who grew up in middle-class America, that would be a major downgrade.
[01:31:57.409 --> 01:32:03.350]  But for someone from overseas, from a third-world nation or a developing nation, that's a major benefit.
[01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:06.310]  And so they're willing to work a lot more for a lot less.
[01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:09.689]  And again, the question is, what is the purpose of this nation?
[01:32:09.829 --> 01:32:22.180]  Is it to just maximize GDP? Is it to get the most profit out of GDP? The workforce or is it to build something that is good and wonderful and a life worth living?
[01:32:23.079 --> 01:32:30.319]  And So I know Alex during the show was saying that Elon Musk is not, he hasn't betrayed anybody.
[01:32:30.319 --> 01:32:30.800]  I agree.
[01:32:30.899 --> 01:32:32.800]  I don't think Elon Musk has betrayed anybody.
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:35.720]  I don't think he's necessarily shifted his position.
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:41.760]  But I think the way that he's going about expressing this stuff is, frankly, extremely offensive.
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:51.539]  I mean, to be told that your nation or your home is just a sports team and you have to justify your existence here...
[01:32:52.289 --> 01:32:56.890]  That, to me, is extremely insulting, again, because I picture a nation as a family.
[01:32:57.029 --> 01:33:13.289]  Now, this isn't a racial thing because, especially in America, in Europe, somewhere like that, you might consider me a white nationalist because I think that there are native populations of UK and Germany and The Netherlands and these places, and they deserve to have a homeland, and they don't deserve to be demonized for wanting to have a homeland.
[01:33:13.810 --> 01:33:16.630]  And this is just a principled stance across the board.
[01:33:16.630 --> 01:33:21.630]  I believe this for everybody, white people, black people, Asian people, Hispanic people.
[01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:24.329]  Everybody deserves to have a homeland, no problem.
[01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:28.250]  I think that's a very standard and principled stance that you can take.
[01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:36.649]  In America, we're a little bit different because we have a different founding, because we have different populations that all came together to create a single country.
[01:33:37.730 --> 01:33:39.430]  So, there are a lot of people...
[01:33:40.710 --> 01:33:43.069]  That are white, Christian, German, or whatever.
[01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:48.510]  But if their family got here 50 years ago, well, there are black families down the road that have been here for 400 years.
[01:33:48.689 --> 01:33:51.449]  So you're gonna tell me they're more American than the black people?
[01:33:51.789 --> 01:33:52.529]  That's ridiculous.
[01:33:52.770 --> 01:33:54.609]  So there's an America.
[01:33:55.029 --> 01:34:04.949]  There's the nation of America, and there are people of all races, colors, and creeds that are a part of this nation and deserve to be served by the government of this nation and the corporations of this nation.
[01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:08.310]  And that, again, is across the board in terms of religion or race.
[01:34:09.119 --> 01:34:16.140]  And I truly believe that, and I think the solution to a lot of the division that we experience as Americans is nationalism.
[01:34:17.619 --> 01:34:23.199]  A lot of the division we experience now between races, it's like, but aren't we all Americans at the end of the day?
[01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:24.460]  And what does that mean?
[01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:27.520]  That means that we're on a team and everybody else is on a different team.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:28.979]  And it's as simple as that.
[01:34:29.619 --> 01:34:31.479]  You and me, we're both Americans.
[01:34:31.479 --> 01:34:33.920]  That means that we are a part of this nation.
[01:34:36.210 --> 01:34:40.390]  It's a unique population of people, and everybody else is not.
[01:34:40.529 --> 01:34:46.029]  And we have to watch each other's backs and care for each other, just like you care for a family.
[01:34:46.449 --> 01:34:47.489]  And this is one of the things.
[01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:52.310]  Adrian Dittman was in a space with a bunch of people, and he was asking...
[01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:58.449]  An American guy to basically justify his existence in America.
[01:34:58.590 --> 01:35:00.029]  Saying, what have you built for America?
[01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:02.630]  Why do you deserve America?
[01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:04.569]  What have you done for this country?
[01:35:04.729 --> 01:35:06.050]  I've paid tons of taxes.
[01:35:06.050 --> 01:35:06.949]  That was his argument.
[01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:14.510]  As I've paid so many taxes into America, which is of course ridiculous anyway, because taxes are, well, a giant scam.
[01:35:14.729 --> 01:35:21.260]  So what he's paid for, he's paid for Certain bombs to be dropped on Russia by Ukraine?
[01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:22.220]  I mean, what does that mean?
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:31.420]  That he's contributed to the infinite supply of money that the federal government summons from nowhere and injects into the pool?
[01:35:31.579 --> 01:35:32.479]  Like, this doesn't mean anything.
[01:35:34.409 --> 01:35:38.750]  But the point is that if you're American, you don't have to justify your existence in America.
[01:35:39.170 --> 01:35:43.569]  You don't have to provide anything to America to be an American.
[01:35:43.569 --> 01:35:44.449]  You are one.
[01:35:44.670 --> 01:35:45.649]  It's your birthright.
[01:35:45.869 --> 01:35:48.609]  And everybody who's not American doesn't enjoy that birthright.
[01:35:48.829 --> 01:35:50.010]  Sorry, that's just how it is.
[01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:52.449]  And again, it's the same thing as a family.
[01:35:52.949 --> 01:35:56.409]  My son doesn't have to justify his existence in my household.
[01:35:56.689 --> 01:35:58.010]  He is my son.
[01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:59.109]  He's my family member.
[01:35:59.250 --> 01:36:00.970]  He gets it de facto.
[01:36:00.970 --> 01:36:03.170]  He can't ever lose it, actually.
[01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:04.010]  He can't ever lose it.
[01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:05.510]  He never has to justify it.
[01:36:05.609 --> 01:36:07.069]  He's just in my family.
[01:36:07.210 --> 01:36:07.850]  That's the same way.
[01:36:07.989 --> 01:36:17.069]  So it's insulting to me to have somebody who admittedly has been very good for the cause of regaining America and making America great again.
[01:36:17.250 --> 01:36:26.899]  Somebody like Elon Musk has certainly helped out To bring back some foundational American principles into the conversation.
[01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:32.420]  But that being said, you don't get to ask an American to justify their existence in America.
[01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:38.119]  It's their birthright, and nobody can take that from them, and they don't have to justify it at all, ever.
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:39.340]  That's just the way it is.
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:43.159]  And part of this, I think, is...
[01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:57.810]  The fact that this has been going on for a long time, it's been going on for decades, the way that discrimination against the American people has been embedded in our every institution.
[01:36:57.850 --> 01:37:00.789]  And so it doesn't start when you're applying for jobs.
[01:37:00.930 --> 01:37:14.350]  It starts when you're in elementary or middle school and the entire We're good to go.
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:43.640]  We're good to go.
[01:37:53.489 --> 01:37:55.930]  To make up for what we've lost, it just makes no sense.
[01:37:56.069 --> 01:37:58.850]  But this is from a person named Louis Conde.
[01:37:59.189 --> 01:38:05.770]  They say, what made America a superpower was its logistics, in particular, allocating its human capital.
[01:38:06.170 --> 01:38:18.239]  American dominance in the 20th century was because it had an exceptional system where teachers all across the country knew to look for exceptionally bright students, make note of it, And make sure they got on a pipeline to elite institutions like MIT or Stanford.
[01:38:18.479 --> 01:38:29.479]  If you look at a lot of people from places like Bell Labs, they came from small towns you've never heard of, like Columbus, Nebraska, Petoskey, Michigan, Farmville, Virginia, or Visalia, California.
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:38.140]  This pipeline got disrupted in the 1970s, and we were coasting on inertia for some time, and now the pipeline has been completely blown up like the Nord Stream.
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:43.920]  This will cause a cascade of calamities as talented white men are frozen out for political reasons.
[01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:58.250]  And I think that's exactly right, and it's a corruption and inversion of what was a very good and fair system that allowed us to dominate the world for the better part of the 20th century.
[01:38:58.649 --> 01:39:09.770]  It was regular dudes, and If you look at World War II and the fact that after World War II, America stood astride the globe, more or less.
[01:39:09.869 --> 01:39:14.170]  Other than those places dominated by the Soviets, America dominated the whole globe.
[01:39:14.289 --> 01:39:17.310]  And the people who were placed almost as like...
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:26.659]  We're good to go.
[01:39:39.159 --> 01:39:43.939]  Serving as almost imperial governors of these entire swaths of the globe.
[01:39:44.479 --> 01:39:45.760]  That was our strength.
[01:39:46.279 --> 01:39:53.359]  Vivek Ramaswamy in his statement where he talks about jocks are the problem with America.
[01:39:53.539 --> 01:39:56.319]  I mean, it's all a little bit disjointed and nonsensical.
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:01.399]  And this is something that everybody my age and younger has experienced.
[01:40:01.439 --> 01:40:11.819]  Every white man my age or non-white person who's honest and actually notices this stuff, it is disadvantaging American citizens of any race, color, and creed.
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:24.090]  Again, it's not specifically a racial thing, except that a lot of the DEI programs are predicated on race, which again is why Is why we're talking about race, right?
[01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:28.170]  It wasn't us that started the conversation about race.
[01:40:28.329 --> 01:40:36.729]  It's the fact that a lot of these measures that are being put forward are based on race, and so it's on a racial basis that we counteract them or argue against them.
[01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:44.289]  And I think this Axios article does a pretty good job of laying out what exactly happened.
[01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:47.329]  MAGA civil war breaks out over American mediocrity culture.
[01:40:47.789 --> 01:40:56.489]  A MAGA world civil war erupted over Christmas when a social media post on American culture turned into a pitched battle over race, immigration, and billionaires versus the working class.
[01:40:56.770 --> 01:40:59.529]  The fight exposes one of MAGA movement's deepest contradictions.
[01:40:59.630 --> 01:41:08.229]  It came to prominence chiefly via the white, less educated working class, but is now under full control of billionaire technologists and industrialists, many of them immigrants.
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:13.220]  And let me just do this.
[01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:22.500]  Let me just zoom out a little bit and sort of talk about what I see as sort of the basis of all this.
[01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:31.939]  Why is it, other than profit, because obviously profit is one of the reasons that they want to bring in people who will work harder for less.
[01:41:32.939 --> 01:41:34.220]  That's obviously one of the reasons.
[01:41:35.779 --> 01:41:45.140]  But even the conversation about H-1B visas, it's not sufficient to explain the outrage here.
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:54.079]  And the outrage really is about the systematic dispossession of Native American citizens for the benefit of foreigners.
[01:41:55.189 --> 01:42:05.229]  And I actually really liked the illustration Alex gave at the beginning of this show where he said, you know, the H-1B visas is like a little scratch on your face when we're bleeding out because we got our leg cut off.
[01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:07.350]  I see this in exactly the same way.
[01:42:07.489 --> 01:42:13.430]  There's almost a triage situation that we're having to deal with here where we are being literally killed by illegal immigration.
[01:42:13.649 --> 01:42:20.210]  Like America as a nation, we're being bankrupted and replaced genetically by illegal immigration.
[01:42:20.210 --> 01:42:23.550]  That is an existential problem that we have to solve immediately.
[01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:26.189]  Immediately, and that has to be the overriding priority.
[01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:31.890]  That being said, the cut on the face can get infected, and it's a major problem as well.
[01:42:32.010 --> 01:42:35.789]  And it has a variety of sort of downstream effects that we have to pay attention to.
[01:42:37.579 --> 01:42:44.760]  And one of these stories went viral last year and continues to be brought up from Zero Hedge.
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:46.520]  Great replacement job shock.
[01:42:46.619 --> 01:42:52.640]  1.3 million native-born Americans lost their jobs replaced by 635 immigrants.
[01:42:52.859 --> 01:43:05.289]  So basically, since the COVID pandemic and the Build Back Better Great Reset, Full-time work has collapsed while part-time work has exploded.
[01:43:06.029 --> 01:43:13.590]  And almost all, in fact, I'll go ahead and say all, all new employment has gone to foreign-born workers.
[01:43:13.729 --> 01:43:27.310]  So this is change in employment by origin in August 2024. Foreign-born workers gained a little over 500,000 jobs, while native-born workers lost over a million, closer to 1.5 million jobs.
[01:43:27.489 --> 01:43:29.850]  So this, and you can see the chart here.
[01:43:30.279 --> 01:43:38.439]  So, again, this isn't about H-1B visas being used by big tech firms to bring in the best and the brightest.
[01:43:38.579 --> 01:43:39.659]  That's not really what's happening anyway.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:42.380]  It's about whether it's illegal or legal immigration.
[01:43:42.699 --> 01:43:45.779]  And these terms are not even really that set in stone.
[01:43:45.979 --> 01:43:49.359]  You know, the Haitians that were planted in Springfield, Ohio...
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:58.279]  It's the same thing we saw then, where you had business owners going, I can't, you know, the Americans don't want to work 12 hours a day, but these Haitians, they never let up.
[01:43:58.380 --> 01:44:03.020]  They'll do anything I say, and I can pay them peanuts, and it's amazing for my business and my profitability.
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:06.279]  This is like a very regular thing.
[01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:11.399]  This is happening systemically, and this also is an existential crisis for America.
[01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:24.229]  Whether native-born workers can get jobs, whether it's worth it to put in the effort to try to get a job in America as a native-born, especially a white American, a heritage American.
[01:44:25.390 --> 01:44:28.050]  Whether it's worth it or whether your job and your...
[01:44:29.649 --> 01:44:42.609]  Salary will be undercut by a foreign worker who will be paid significantly less and may even have their wages supplied by some sort of government program whose design is to sell out your job for pennies on the dollar.
[01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:47.590]  U.S. created zero jobs for native-born workers in the past six years.
[01:44:47.829 --> 01:44:55.250]  So this is change in employment since July 2018. In the hundreds of thousands, foreign-born workers have gained...
[01:44:55.250 --> 01:44:56.970]  What even is this number?
[01:44:57.229 --> 01:44:58.409]  Nearly five...
[01:44:59.539 --> 01:45:00.439]  Billion jobs?
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:01.260]  Five million jobs.
[01:45:01.699 --> 01:45:12.380]  Foreign-born workers have gained five million jobs since 2018. Native-born workers have lost nearly half a million jobs since 2018. So this isn't a small thing.
[01:45:12.479 --> 01:45:20.699]  This isn't just a few thousand engineers that big tech can't find from the American job pools.
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:24.319]  They have to outsource or insource by bringing in people from other countries.
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:41.859]  This is a systemic issue in which millions of native workers Born people are without jobs, and millions upon millions of foreign-born workers are being given those jobs because they'll work for less and be satisfied with a lower status of life.
[01:45:43.659 --> 01:45:48.159]  And Daniel Horowitz has a great article on this from December 1st.
[01:45:49.449 --> 01:45:54.250]  5th of this year, America last, foreign workers fill jobs while Americans are left out.
[01:45:54.649 --> 01:46:01.710]  Legal immigration since 1989 has transformed the nation, reaching a record 51.6 million foreign-born residents while sidelining American workers.
[01:46:02.069 --> 01:46:03.210]  Trump needs to act fast.
[01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:09.489]  And again, like I was saying about the Haitians, those are all technically legal immigrants because they've been given a temporary protective...
[01:46:09.899 --> 01:46:12.260]  Yeah.
[01:46:23.239 --> 01:46:27.359]  The foreign-born population has reached a record 51.6 million every year.
[01:46:27.460 --> 01:46:33.979]  The US issues 1.1 million green cards, 1 million guest worker visas, and 1.1 million foreign student visas.
[01:46:34.199 --> 01:46:38.560]  This level of immigration has transformed the nation over the past generation in unprecedented ways.
[01:46:38.739 --> 01:46:41.640]  The real debate should focus on how much immigration we can curtail.
[01:46:42.039 --> 01:46:50.560]  Unfortunately, influential forces connected to Trump donors and transition team leaders are pushing the foreign worker pool, even though America already has more than enough.
[01:46:51.739 --> 01:47:12.460]  And again, this article just goes on and on, laying out the numbers of exactly how many native-born workers have lost their jobs in favor of foreign-born workers who are brought in, have their wages subsidized by the government, or are able to be paid significantly less because they are satisfied with lower living standards than the American people.
[01:47:13.699 --> 01:47:16.439]  And no small part of this...
[01:47:17.739 --> 01:47:21.579]  It goes to this story here, originally from Business Insider.
[01:47:21.659 --> 01:47:30.239]  I believe this is a reprint from New York Post, but this is from all the way back in 2020. Whole Foods reportedly ranked stores based on risks they could unionize.
[01:47:30.359 --> 01:47:36.899]  And the big takeaway from this story was that they tracked stores and tracked employees when Amazon purchased Whole Foods.
[01:47:37.649 --> 01:47:53.649]  We're good to go.
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:03.880]  We're good to go.
[01:48:27.140 --> 01:48:28.579]  This is no small part of it.
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:30.340]  This is all a part of a grand design.
[01:48:30.739 --> 01:48:37.560]  Illegal immigration, legal immigration, it's all part of a method by which the globalists believe they can establish a system.
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:41.899]  I think of it like a laundry cycle where you're constantly bringing in new people.
[01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:50.960]  You're constantly refreshing the population with new arrivals from the third world and replacing the dying out population native to the country.
[01:48:51.239 --> 01:48:53.260]  And immigration is never going to end.
[01:48:53.479 --> 01:48:53.920]  It's never...
[01:48:54.859 --> 01:49:06.779]  Their plan is for it to never end, to be an endless cycle of replacement where you have first world production being absolutely massive and tons of surplus food and just material everything.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:09.300]  Send that to the third world.
[01:49:09.439 --> 01:49:11.460]  Keep the third world birth rates extremely high.
[01:49:11.779 --> 01:49:19.000]  The surplus population from the third world will be brought into the first world where they will be introduced to our suicidal life.
[01:49:20.069 --> 01:49:26.409]  We're good to go.
[01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:47.699]  And within a couple generations, their bloodline will die out.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:49.300]  Their kids won't have kids.
[01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:55.960]  Their kids will be poisoned and have their testosterone dropped massively by all the nanoplastics and all that stuff.
[01:49:56.140 --> 01:50:00.819]  And they'll eventually die out and have to be replaced by another tranche of people from the third world who...
[01:50:01.310 --> 01:50:03.590]  Are only there because of the surplus of the first world.
[01:50:03.710 --> 01:50:26.350]  And you just continually replace the population of a country over and over, piece by piece, for years on end, and nobody will ever have the cultural impetus or population This is a method by which the globalists plan to rule forever,
[01:50:26.989 --> 01:50:32.630]  getting rid eventually of national discrimination whatsoever, national delineations whatsoever.
[01:50:32.630 --> 01:50:48.430]  It'll just be a continually moving pit of or laundry cycle of population of people moving from one place to another, having their history and Power degraded and destroyed and then being replaced by a new group of people.
[01:50:48.789 --> 01:50:56.210]  Meanwhile, the globalists sit on top and watch everybody else be divided amongst ourselves and not focusing on what they're up to.
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:51:04.279]  The globalist, black rock, New World Order criminals want to make you poor and they want to make you sick.
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:05.760]  It's in their own admissions.
[01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:13.520]  Well, in any real revolution against tyranny, it is critical that we be independent and that we have the power of free speech.
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:19.380]  I'm bringing you the ultimate win-win or 360 win or non-zero-sum game.

[01:52:00.590 --> 01:52:01.850]  They want us isolated.
[01:52:01.989 --> 01:52:05.130]  They don't want all this Patriot apparel out there so we realize how strong we are.

[01:52:07.369 --> 01:52:09.609]  This thing is so exciting.
[01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:14.130]  I was sitting here before I sort of taping this announcement, and I was thinking, how do I hype this enough?

[01:54:56.609 --> 01:54:57.470]  Welcome back.
[01:54:57.609 --> 01:54:59.850]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is The Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:59.949 --> 01:55:02.869]  I'm your host, Harrison Smith, sitting in for Alex this hour.
[01:55:03.029 --> 01:55:12.090]  I'll be handing the baton off to Jay Dyer at the 2 o'clock central time frame, and very excited to hear from him as well.
[01:55:12.250 --> 01:55:22.409]  I've been talking about the big controversy that's been happening Absolutely dominating X. And again, I've never seen anything dominate the conversation this way.
[01:55:22.529 --> 01:55:30.090]  I've never seen a single topic of discussion that seems to crowd out every other topic of discussion out there.
[01:55:31.289 --> 01:55:34.350]  And it's interesting even just asking why that is.
[01:55:34.529 --> 01:55:46.010]  Why is this a topic that would so dominate and divide the MAGA world, the world that now sort of dominates on social media overall?
[01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:54.289]  And it's been very interesting to see where people fall on this dividing line.
[01:55:54.970 --> 01:55:56.109]  Because a lot of people...
[01:55:57.359 --> 01:56:01.960]  Even I think the Axios article is like, there's a division between the tech right and the far right.
[01:56:02.979 --> 01:56:05.140]  And that's just not the case.
[01:56:05.279 --> 01:56:06.739]  This is not a far right position.
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:11.180]  To be against the H-1B visas is not even remotely a far right position.
[01:56:11.300 --> 01:56:21.920]  In fact, it has been the position that Donald Trump has held since 2016. And this statement from Trump in March of 2016 Lays it out pretty clearly.
[01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:23.600]  Donald J. Trump position on visas.
[01:56:23.859 --> 01:56:53.930]  He says, I will end forever the use of H-1B as a cheap labor program and institute an absolute
[01:56:53.930 --> 01:56:59.250]  requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program, no exceptions.
[01:57:00.369 --> 01:57:05.430]  And this is one of the odd things, is that people on the other side are throwing around claims like racism.
[01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:12.850]  Going very libtard in their response to this, going, oh, these are just trolls and racist and Russian bots.
[01:57:13.029 --> 01:57:20.890]  And it's like, well, that's what you say when you can't actually answer the questions that we're presenting or counter the arguments that we're making.
[01:57:20.890 --> 01:57:21.810]  You call us names.
[01:57:21.989 --> 01:57:23.710]  It wasn't effective when the left did it.
[01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:27.810]  It's not going to be effective when people on the right do it.
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:33.699]  And Ashley St. Clair had some very interesting things to say about this.
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:35.880]  I'll read those to you on the other side of a break.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.079]  And it's not just Disney that has done this.
[01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:49.140]  Apple has paid a $25 million settlement over a suit favoring foreign hires and making it hard for U.S. workers to apply for jobs so that none of them actually got the jobs.
[01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:55.319]  Facebook settled claims it discriminated against U.S. workers for some jobs in favor of temporary visa holders.
[01:57:55.359 --> 01:57:57.520]  Because this isn't about getting the best and brightest.
[01:57:58.170 --> 01:58:10.869]  This is not about brain drain from the rest of the world and America being a bastion where people who dominate in their fields overseas can then come to America and lend that genius to us.
[01:58:11.010 --> 01:58:14.970]  This is about Globally sourced scab workers.
[01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.770]  That's what this is.
[01:58:15.890 --> 01:58:26.409]  This is globally sourced scab workers who will undercut the American people and take the position that a middle class American could have in a company.
[01:58:26.670 --> 01:58:30.510]  And of course, this is just downstream from the fact that this happens in universities.
[01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:31.779]  As well.
[01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:46.159]  And we actually have internal documents from the likes of Facebook and their diversity initiative where they talk about priority may be given to H1B applicants from China and Korea to foster larger communities of diverse workers at Facebook.
[01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:51.149]  When hiring for HR positions, it's important to prioritize H-1B visa workers.
[01:58:51.310 --> 01:58:55.449]  And this will stimulate the process of diversification of the workforce.
[01:58:55.710 --> 01:58:59.869]  Again, the predicate of this being that diversity is a good thing.
[01:59:00.029 --> 01:59:07.050]  Now, we don't agree that diversity is a good thing, but if you believe that diversity is de facto and by definition good, then you're going to be in favor of this.
[01:59:07.170 --> 01:59:08.250]  H-1B visa workers.
[01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:23.930]  Foster more creative and diverse efforts at MPK. Although not mandatory, we recognize that the priority of H-1B applicants in favor of American applicants is for the greater good of company culture, by which they mean the greater the diversity is in a population,
[01:59:23.930 --> 01:59:27.489]  the less likely they are to rebel against the management.
[01:59:27.869 --> 01:59:33.449]  So again, extrapolate that to a wider population, and I think you see the real underlying cause of this.
[01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:40.420]  Now, we'll get back to this on the other side, because you noticed it was HR people that were going to be the first prioritized, and there's a reason for that.
[01:59:40.939 --> 01:59:45.399]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to this live Friday broadcast of The Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:45.659 --> 01:59:48.340]  I'm your host, Harrison Smith, sitting in for Alex.
[01:59:48.659 --> 01:59:54.380]  For the next hour, I'm going to open up the lines for your calls, because I imagine a lot of people want to sound off on this.
[01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:57.539]  And this, again, is one of the beautiful things about Infowars.
[01:59:58.449 --> 02:00:07.090]  Not only do the hosts of the different shows might differ on certain topics, but we almost always open up the phone lines for your calls.
[02:00:07.210 --> 02:00:08.869]  And we want you to disagree with us.
[02:00:08.970 --> 02:00:09.869]  We want you to...
[02:00:12.869 --> 02:00:14.250]  We just want to be right.
[02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:19.510]  And I think back to the classic Winston Churchill quote where he says, I'd rather be right than consistent.
[02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:21.390]  I don't want to be consistently wrong.
[02:00:21.810 --> 02:00:25.649]  I don't value, well, I've had this position, I'll stick by it forever.
[02:00:25.770 --> 02:00:31.869]  If you can show me different information, I will absolutely change my position because I'd rather be right than consistent.
[02:00:33.300 --> 02:00:41.220]  And so we will open up the phone lines for people who agree or disagree, and we don't screen other than just taking your name and asking what you want to talk about.
[02:00:42.119 --> 02:00:46.600]  People sometimes call in and they lie about what they want to talk about because they think we're not going to let them on.
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:47.859]  No, we're going to let you on.
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:50.880]  And if you disagree with us, we'll let you on even quicker.
[02:00:51.609 --> 02:01:05.029]  To be honest with you, because we like when people disagree with us, we don't mind it, and that is the point of having an open system and free speech and a republic where you can actually work these things out in public, in conversations.
[02:01:05.029 --> 02:01:09.189]  You don't just have to mindlessly agree with whoever is in charge.
[02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:16.180]  That is sort of the basis of our nation, and we try to live that here in I'm going to go ahead and open up the phone lines right now.
[02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:20.859]  If you want to give us a call, call in at 1-877-789-2539.
[02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:24.520]  That's 1-877-789-2539.
[02:01:25.239 --> 02:01:29.399]  And as I'm mentioning it, let me remind you to go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:33.359]  Thealexjonesstore.com keeps us on the air and in the fight, whether we...
[02:01:36.690 --> 02:01:56.369]  We're good to go.
[02:02:01.820 --> 02:02:20.899]  We're good to go.
[02:02:22.210 --> 02:02:33.689]  And I hope that you can be a part of this and join us as an elite member of our resistance by going to thealexjonesstore.com, becoming a VIP member, or simply doing your shopping.
[02:02:33.890 --> 02:02:51.449]  We all have a few days left before New Year's, and I always encourage people to, and I do it myself, sort of, I orchestrate my New Year's resolutions around supplements, if I want to Get better sleep, I need the sleepy time gummies.
[02:02:51.590 --> 02:02:53.970]  If I want more energy, I need the energy gummies.
[02:02:55.390 --> 02:03:08.649]  Be ready to hit the ground running with your New Year's resolutions this New Year's Day by going now to thealexjonesstore.com and getting the supplements you need that can maximize your efforts to better your own life and be in the best health of your life.
[02:03:08.789 --> 02:03:13.949]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com, the CMOS, the t-shirts, the hats, the new mugs.
[02:03:14.890 --> 02:03:31.500]  It's one of my favorite mugs of all time, and I was very sad when we stopped selling them at the InfoWars store, but they're now on sale at thealexjonesstore.com, the Save the Frogs mug, an absolute classic, something you can take to work, and people just I think you're a lover of nature,
[02:03:31.659 --> 02:03:46.260]  and you are, but then you can start the conversation and tell them about Atrazine and other things that for a long time were only discussed on Infowars and have now finally broken through to the mainstream and are a topic of discussion at the highest levels of our government and on mainstream media.
[02:03:46.439 --> 02:03:49.920]  It's a beautiful, beautiful thing to see people finally catching up to this.
[02:03:50.239 --> 02:03:56.039]  And I guess it's up to us to help to guide and help facilitate that continuing awakening.
[02:03:59.580 --> 02:04:04.479]  Now, again, it's not even about necessarily the H-1B visa argument.
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:12.260]  This spirals out instantly into a number of different issues, one of them being that the American people are simply not being prioritized.
[02:04:12.359 --> 02:04:25.010]  And again, if you just think of it as a family, if you think of your nation and your fellow American citizens, As members of an extended family, your cousins and aunts and uncles, rather than just some person that happens to live next to you.
[02:04:25.149 --> 02:04:28.050]  But actually, think of them as an extended family.
[02:04:28.210 --> 02:04:34.250]  It becomes absurd, the idea that you would replace them in favor of somebody who can make you more money.
[02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:35.630]  That's not what family's about.
[02:04:35.710 --> 02:04:37.189]  It's not what families are for.
[02:04:37.369 --> 02:04:43.710]  So of course it spirals into just who we are as a nation, what the purpose of government is as a whole.
[02:04:44.130 --> 02:05:03.289]  And it also has now become embroiled in censorship as it seems like censorship is being brought down on X sort of for the first time since Elon Musk bought it and perhaps in response to Elon Musk Being countersignaled by so many on the right.
[02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:12.869]  And he posted something that said, if you're pissing off the 10% of the far left and the 10% of the far right simultaneously, you're doing something right.
[02:05:13.029 --> 02:05:15.569]  Because you want to piss off the extremists on either side.
[02:05:15.789 --> 02:05:17.590]  But that's not what's happening here.
[02:05:18.029 --> 02:05:28.550]  About 75% of the people on the right, Republicans or people who just fall to the right side of the dividing line, are against this.
[02:05:29.789 --> 02:05:43.409]  Infinite H-1B visas are against selling out the American people for slightly lower wages and an imported class of what amounts to indentured servitude.
[02:05:43.750 --> 02:05:55.350]  Former Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz saying, we welcomed tech bros when they came running our way to avoid the third grade teacher picking their kids' gender and the obvious Biden-Harris economic decline.
[02:05:55.350 --> 02:05:58.550]  We did not ask them to engineer an immigration system.
[02:05:58.829 --> 02:05:59.270]  Policy.
[02:05:59.409 --> 02:06:08.090]  And this is one of the other things, the great things that have been revealed throughout this entire conversation is that MAGA is the farthest thing from a cult that you could possibly have.
[02:06:08.210 --> 02:06:10.590]  A cult does whatever the leaders say.
[02:06:10.729 --> 02:06:16.329]  If you're in charge of the cult and you say the sky is red, well, that cult is going to start saying the sky is red.
[02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:17.649]  This is the opposite.
[02:06:17.949 --> 02:06:22.890]  And in a way, it is flexing our power as populists.
[02:06:23.149 --> 02:06:25.819]  That It doesn't matter how many billions you have.
[02:06:25.939 --> 02:06:28.640]  It doesn't matter whether you're even elected president.
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:32.659]  We have principles that we stick to and we will argue in favor of.
[02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:37.140]  And if you don't want to join us on this, then we'll leave you behind.
[02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:41.199]  They need us more than we need them at the end of the day.
[02:06:42.220 --> 02:06:44.119]  And again, I'm glad that they're on our side.
[02:06:44.279 --> 02:06:45.960]  I'm glad that they're helping Trump win.
[02:06:46.159 --> 02:06:49.600]  I'm glad that they're trying to do the Doge and the Department of Government Efficiency.
[02:06:50.689 --> 02:06:57.590]  But when they start talking about our nation and our home, like a sports team or a corporation, now we have an issue.
[02:06:57.750 --> 02:07:10.390]  And maybe we need to remind them, like, look, the other side, the left, want to and were starting to do any number of things to utterly destroy you.
[02:07:10.829 --> 02:07:14.130]  We covered it many times, the way that basically every...
[02:07:19.300 --> 02:07:33.619]  We're good to go.
[02:07:38.970 --> 02:07:42.710]  We're good to go.
[02:08:00.890 --> 02:08:10.109]  Actually have laws in place where you have to hire American citizens because they're dealing with secrets and they don't want foreign spies getting access to some of our advanced technology.
[02:08:10.409 --> 02:08:15.369]  And so in a way, it's like those are the only places that are still incentivized to hire American citizens.
[02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:26.409]  So it's like the people that are causing our problems by lobbying for war overseas so they can get government contracts and weapons orders to ship to Ukraine or Israel or wherever else.
[02:08:27.149 --> 02:08:31.329]  Are also the only ones that are forced and actually participate in hiring Americans.
[02:08:31.569 --> 02:08:35.270]  So it's kind of like they caused the problem, but they're also solving a different problem.
[02:08:35.470 --> 02:08:36.609]  It's all a little bit confusing.
[02:08:36.770 --> 02:08:45.840]  But the point is that they have gone after Elon and will go after Elon With insane intensity.
[02:08:46.140 --> 02:08:47.739]  Like, they want to destroy him.
[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:48.899]  They want him gone.
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:50.020]  Now, we like him.
[02:08:50.119 --> 02:08:51.479]  We want him to be able to operate.
[02:08:51.619 --> 02:08:58.199]  We want him to be able to continue to build rockets and launch satellites and open up X for free speech.
[02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:03.840]  But if you drive us away, it's like, I guess they're just gonna go, I guess they're just gonna destroy you.
[02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:05.760]  I guess the left is just gonna destroy you because...
[02:09:06.739 --> 02:09:12.460]  You've turned against the people that would defend and counteract their insane targeting.
[02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:16.840]  So it's weird.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:17.699]  It's a little weird.
[02:09:17.939 --> 02:09:19.859]  And some strange things are happening, right?
[02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:22.439]  Elon Musk said this yesterday.
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:30.979]  And really all of this started with the appointment of a figure by Donald Trump who was a lifelong antagonist.
[02:09:31.340 --> 02:09:42.560]  And until very recently, a Kamala supporter, the skirmish started Monday, this is according to Axios, when Trump named venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan as his advisor on AI policy.
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:51.420]  Krishnan's appointment triggered an anti-Indian backlash on social media, particularly given his past advocacy for lifting caps on green cards.
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:54.819]  Again, this is a slightly dishonest framing of the situation.
[02:09:56.109 --> 02:10:00.810]  We just don't want to be swamped by Indian people.
[02:10:00.970 --> 02:10:04.109]  And no offense to India, they have India.
[02:10:04.250 --> 02:10:06.409]  India is a country, it's theirs, it's all Indians.
[02:10:06.850 --> 02:10:09.289]  And they built it, and they've lived there forever.
[02:10:09.529 --> 02:10:13.949]  And there are 1.5 billion of them on that subcontinent.
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:16.460]  1.5 billion.
[02:10:16.899 --> 02:10:33.840]  So that means that you could, if you had a magic wand or some sort of horrifying device, if you replaced every single American citizen in America today with an Indian from India, they would still have the biggest population of the world.
[02:10:34.399 --> 02:10:40.699]  Their population would go from 1.5 billion to 1.2 billion, and there would be no more Americans' existence, right?
[02:10:40.859 --> 02:10:57.239]  So their population is unbelievably massive, and there has to be limitations to the number of Indians that can come over, because they could literally swamp us and replace us one-to-one and still have the highest population in the world back in India, despite losing 300 million Americans.
[02:10:57.640 --> 02:11:01.460]  So these numbers are incredible and massive.
[02:11:01.479 --> 02:11:19.920]  And basically what this Christian guy was advocating for was removing country caps for the H-1B visas, meaning that there would be no limitation to the number of Indian people from India who could apply for and probably get visas to come to America.
[02:11:20.199 --> 02:11:23.880]  And the fact is that you can pay them a lot less.
[02:11:24.100 --> 02:11:25.359]  They'll work well.
[02:11:26.179 --> 02:11:40.880]  Unreasonable hours that the American people wouldn't be okay with, and that would be a great benefit for the people at the top to make extra money, but in doing so is sacrificing the American population on the altar of GDP. And nobody...
[02:11:41.550 --> 02:11:45.949]  Who is actually American, wants that, or thinks that's a good thing.
[02:11:46.170 --> 02:11:53.630]  Because again, if you think of the nation as a family, this is replacing your family with higher production imports.
[02:11:53.630 --> 02:11:54.949]  And it's just like, that's insane.
[02:11:55.029 --> 02:11:55.970]  That's an insane thing to do.
[02:11:57.430 --> 02:12:00.630]  So then Elon Musk says we need double that number yesterday, right?
[02:12:00.689 --> 02:12:01.770]  We need more engineers.
[02:12:01.930 --> 02:12:09.970]  We need more, which is a little bit absurd anyway because, you know, very recently, like last year, Tesla laid off like tens of thousands of engineers.
[02:12:10.170 --> 02:12:15.810]  And when Elon Musk bought X, he laid off 80% of their worker pool.
[02:12:16.189 --> 02:12:19.310]  So, you know, clearly you're not...
[02:12:21.090 --> 02:12:25.930]  We're good to go.
[02:12:35.500 --> 02:12:45.380]  I wonder if they think that's true because the American applicants never get presented to them.
[02:12:45.500 --> 02:13:02.979]  I wonder if you've got this filter that every application has to go through and it's some hyper-radicalized leftist person that sees that it's a white dude from Kansas and just throws out their Throws out their resume in favor of,
[02:13:03.159 --> 02:13:06.140]  you know, to force the company to take somebody from India.
[02:13:06.319 --> 02:13:10.079]  So to the view of the CEO, he's like, there's no applications from American people.
[02:13:10.180 --> 02:13:18.979]  But the reality is, somewhere down the line, there's some leftist who thinks that they're, you know, achieving equality by throwing out the white guy's applications.
[02:13:18.979 --> 02:13:25.539]  So the CEO, he's being honest when he says he thinks that there are no applicants, when really there are, but they're not being...
[02:13:26.579 --> 02:13:27.260]  Allowed in.
[02:13:27.420 --> 02:13:29.319]  And again, this really is across the board.
[02:13:29.399 --> 02:13:32.699]  I have a friend who's not even white, but he's an American citizen.
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:33.779]  He's Middle Eastern.
[02:13:34.460 --> 02:13:39.159]  And he had a good degree from a prominent university.
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:43.439]  He applied to 700 jobs without hearing back.
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:47.439]  700 applications sent out without hearing back.
[02:13:48.630 --> 02:13:49.010]  Why?
[02:13:49.170 --> 02:14:03.109]  Because the firms that he was applying to got much cheaper wages from offshoring or inshoring their worker population from overseas.
[02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:19.859]  So, Elon Musk says, Now, somebody responded to this saying,
[02:14:21.739 --> 02:14:27.880]  With electric and computer engineering degrees in 2023, he cannot get an interview, let alone a job.
[02:14:28.060 --> 02:14:30.800]  Any white male he knew in college can't get jobs either.
[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:34.899]  Many are currently working in data center jobs that don't require their education.
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:44.960]  This was a user with only 300 followers and yet ratioed Elon Musk, meaning that they got 16,000 likes while Elon Musk only got 10,000.
[02:14:45.119 --> 02:14:46.720]  That account is now gone.
[02:14:47.479 --> 02:14:56.659]  That DRG accounts, whether they deactivated it themselves or it was deactivated for them, they don't exist anymore on X, which is extremely suspicious.
[02:14:58.260 --> 02:15:03.960]  And relates to some of the other censorship that we're seeing that has even hit the likes of our own Owen Schroyer.
[02:15:04.199 --> 02:15:11.359]  In fact, I have a video from him that I may go to in the next segment, but I do want to get out to your calls here momentarily.
[02:15:11.619 --> 02:15:26.119]  I'll just say this is one more sort of exchange that I think highlights the conversation that occurred yesterday and the day before on X. So this account called Autism Capital says, basically the right split into two factions, the tech right and the right right.
[02:15:26.810 --> 02:15:30.829]  And the tech right is like, hey, we need H-1B visa people to do the jobs.
[02:15:30.949 --> 02:15:33.569]  And the right right was like, no, you need to hire Americans.
[02:15:33.670 --> 02:15:36.250]  And the tech right is like, but you guys are retarded.
[02:15:36.430 --> 02:15:38.710]  And the right right is like, well, you don't train us.
[02:15:38.829 --> 02:15:41.989]  And the tech right is like, you can't out-train being retarded.
[02:15:42.170 --> 02:15:46.369]  And all while this was going on, we learned some people really don't like Indians.
[02:15:46.710 --> 02:15:49.229]  This from Elon Musk says, that pretty much sums it up.
[02:15:49.310 --> 02:15:49.909]  This was eye-opening.
[02:15:51.199 --> 02:15:54.260]  Again, the thing about not liking Indians, they started it.
[02:15:54.399 --> 02:15:58.079]  Let me just say they started it because people said, hey, look, we don't need...
[02:15:58.079 --> 02:16:03.600]  You've got this Indian guy who goes, hey, we don't need country caps because I want to bring in an infant number of Indians.
[02:16:04.579 --> 02:16:06.899]  The Americans go, well, we don't need Indians.
[02:16:07.079 --> 02:16:08.359]  We don't want to be India.
[02:16:08.359 --> 02:16:10.319]  We have our own country, our own culture.
[02:16:10.619 --> 02:16:11.680]  Why would we need Indians?
[02:16:11.939 --> 02:16:18.960]  And then you had a bunch of Indian people, including employees at X, who are Indian, saying, deal with it, white guy.
[02:16:19.100 --> 02:16:26.119]  We're going to take over and dominate, and you suck and are worthless and retarded, and so we're going to take your jobs and your country.
[02:16:26.239 --> 02:16:26.699]  Deal with it.
[02:16:28.010 --> 02:16:29.949]  So, let's just be clear here.
[02:16:30.210 --> 02:16:31.890]  How are you supposed to respond to that?
[02:16:32.110 --> 02:16:32.729]  Yes, sir.
[02:16:32.850 --> 02:16:33.409]  Oh, okay.
[02:16:33.409 --> 02:16:33.889]  I'm sorry.
[02:16:33.969 --> 02:16:35.989]  I didn't realize that you guys were so much better than us.
[02:16:36.110 --> 02:16:36.930]  Gee, sorry.
[02:16:37.229 --> 02:16:37.389]  No.
[02:16:37.510 --> 02:16:40.850]  You respond to it by going, what did you just say?
[02:16:40.930 --> 02:16:41.290]  I'm sorry.
[02:16:41.329 --> 02:16:42.750]  You want to compare India to America?
[02:16:42.930 --> 02:16:44.930]  You really want to go down this road?
[02:16:45.229 --> 02:16:47.290]  You really want to play this game, India?
[02:16:47.450 --> 02:16:51.329]  Because I got some documentaries I can show you that'll blow your mind.
[02:16:51.909 --> 02:16:53.110]  It'll probably make you puke.
[02:16:54.069 --> 02:16:55.950]  And then that's like, oh wow, they hate Indians.
[02:16:56.149 --> 02:16:58.149]  It's like, well, no, we don't hate Indians.
[02:16:58.270 --> 02:17:09.409]  It's just you've got a bunch of Indians who are actively insulting and discriminating against and just being very hateful towards Americans, so we don't have to take that.
[02:17:09.569 --> 02:17:12.010]  So even that is just, wow, they really don't like Indians.
[02:17:12.129 --> 02:17:13.409]  Well, no, we don't like Indians.
[02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:14.879]  People insulting us.
[02:17:14.959 --> 02:17:19.500]  We don't like people claiming that they're taking us over and then trying to change the laws to do just that.
[02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:20.860]  It's not about hating Indians.
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:21.620]  I love Indians.
[02:17:21.799 --> 02:17:27.219]  So my best friends are first or second generation Indian immigrants.
[02:17:27.540 --> 02:17:33.540]  That being said, go to Sugar Land, a town outside of Houston, 100% Indians.
[02:17:34.270 --> 02:17:34.750]  100%.
[02:17:34.750 --> 02:17:44.969]  They create ethnic conclaves where they bring in their own people, they do chain migration, and they completely take over places that were formerly filled with Americans of every race, color, and greed.
[02:17:45.049 --> 02:17:47.129]  They become monolithically Indian.
[02:17:47.489 --> 02:17:53.090]  And that's a strategy, it's a plan, it's one of the things that they do through the implementation of these conclaves.
[02:18:05.599 --> 02:18:11.180]  This is literally not at all what's happened.
[02:18:11.379 --> 02:18:15.059]  It started with a post where somebody suggested we remove caps from H-1Bs.
[02:18:15.159 --> 02:18:17.180]  This isn't our first H-1B rodeo.
[02:18:17.350 --> 02:18:23.770]  In 2016, Trump campaigned on ending the H-1B abuse, which drives down American wages and creates servants for the tech lords.
[02:18:24.049 --> 02:18:31.030]  Then, tech billionaires, after they were caught, conflated and obfuscated the argument to be about bringing in more super geniuses.
[02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:34.750]  But there's already visa programs for geniuses and very exceptional people.
[02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:36.870]  It's O-1 and EB-1 visas.
[02:18:37.049 --> 02:18:41.409]  So now they're conflating the argument with MAGA is retarded and racist.
[02:18:41.409 --> 02:18:43.629]  These are Democrat and MSM tactics, by the way.
[02:18:44.030 --> 02:18:52.370]  So now Americans are just too stupid to do jobs, and we have to be saved by H-1Bs doing entry and mid-level tech jobs, even though it's about the geniuses, right?
[02:18:52.770 --> 02:19:08.090]  Tech billionaires that were lifelong Democrats who hated Trump and MAGA until six months ago, who recently just started claiming they're pro-Trump and pro-MAGA, are now calling MAGA retards and racists, and the slightly smarter ones are still conflating arguments with H-1B and O-1 slash E-B-1,
[02:19:08.250 --> 02:19:09.709]  still a Democrat MSM tactic.
[02:19:09.909 --> 02:19:11.750]  They got caught, and this was a mask off.
[02:19:12.090 --> 02:19:13.750]  And I agree with that.
[02:19:13.850 --> 02:19:16.110]  I think that's a fair reading of the situation.
[02:19:16.370 --> 02:19:32.909]  And again, we don't have to take being told by foreign people that our culture is insufficient or lacking or that we just need to die and be replaced because we don't...
[02:19:34.250 --> 02:19:48.889]  Spend our Saturday nights pouring over study material, but actually choose to want to build a life where having fun and having family and having a life that's meaningful and social is a good thing.
[02:19:49.069 --> 02:19:49.670]  That's...
[02:19:51.309 --> 02:19:52.290]  It's actually true.
[02:19:52.430 --> 02:19:52.950]  It's actually true.
[02:19:53.069 --> 02:19:55.129]  That is a good thing and we should want more of that.
[02:19:55.309 --> 02:20:02.889]  And by the way, America absolutely dominated the entire world when it was run by people who were jocks in high school.
[02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:06.489]  The people who, you know, landed on the moon and stuff like that.
[02:20:09.180 --> 02:20:11.680]  I'll go out to college just as soon as we get back from the commercial break.
[02:20:11.739 --> 02:20:13.500]  I've got two minutes left in this segment.
[02:20:13.639 --> 02:20:23.059]  I do want to remind you to go to thealexjonesstore.com to support this singular, incredible, and unique platform for the truth, justice, and the American way, which is all this is.
[02:20:23.180 --> 02:20:24.620]  Again, people conflate it.
[02:20:24.819 --> 02:20:25.819]  They do it with everything.
[02:20:25.979 --> 02:20:27.340]  You say, hey, I don't want...
[02:20:27.930 --> 02:20:34.729]  I don't want an infinite number of Indians to be competing with my son when he grows up.
[02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:48.459]  And then they turn around and go, oh, so you hate Indians, huh?
[02:20:48.579 --> 02:20:49.639]  And it's like, what?
[02:20:49.979 --> 02:20:51.040]  What are you talking about?
[02:20:51.159 --> 02:20:52.139]  No, I don't.
[02:20:52.219 --> 02:20:54.000]  And then you got an Indian guy like, well, we hate you.
[02:20:54.120 --> 02:20:55.600]  And it's like, all right, cool.
[02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:57.100]  I guess this is where we're at now.
[02:20:57.639 --> 02:20:58.819]  No, don't conflate it.
[02:20:58.879 --> 02:20:59.340]  Don't, don't.
[02:21:00.090 --> 02:21:01.090]  Get it twisted.
[02:21:01.530 --> 02:21:06.629]  We love everybody all around the world and we want America to be the best, but we also want America to be America.
[02:21:06.889 --> 02:21:21.909]  And what we stand for are American principles and American foundational ideas, which are being undercut by people who would rather make a little bit of profit than support their fellow Americans and their drive for having a meaningful and comfortable life.
[02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:35.280]  Ashley St. Clair goes on to point out a system by which the H-1B visas are abused, saying a big-shot employment attorney in California said that the market is controlled by visa body shops.
[02:21:35.459 --> 02:21:37.559]  They apply for around 50% of the visas.
[02:21:37.780 --> 02:21:39.159]  The economics of it are this.
[02:21:39.299 --> 02:21:43.040]  These body shops are headed by former hiring managers from big tech companies.
[02:21:43.239 --> 02:21:48.280]  They bring people to America, rent apartments for them, and house about 10 together in one apartment.
[02:21:48.629 --> 02:22:15.569]  We're good to go.
[02:22:16.350 --> 02:22:28.190]  The all-time fan favorite bestseller, Vitamin Mineral Fusion is finally back in stock, exclusively available at drjonesnaturals.com, my dad's great supplement company website.

[02:23:18.030 --> 02:23:20.190]  Harrison Smith sitting in for Alex Jones.
[02:23:20.370 --> 02:23:27.290]  I usually host the American Journal each and every weekday morning here on Infowarsband.video, Infowars.com.
[02:23:27.370 --> 02:23:30.909]  We stream, of course, on X and Rumble and however you're finding us.
[02:23:31.010 --> 02:23:36.270]  Thank you for circumventing the control system and finding this forbidden information.
[02:23:36.469 --> 02:23:38.069]  So glad to have you here with us.
[02:23:38.149 --> 02:23:39.270]  Let's go out to the call now.
[02:23:39.670 --> 02:23:42.989]  This is Chase in Illinois on Line 11. Go ahead.
[02:23:43.149 --> 02:23:44.090]  You're on the air about immigration.
[02:23:44.090 --> 02:23:44.549]  Chase.
[02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:49.520]  Mr. Harris, it is my great pleasure to speak to you.
[02:23:50.659 --> 02:23:58.059]  I want to make, just really quick, a radical argument in the sense that words have a meaning, and so I want to agree with you.
[02:23:58.799 --> 02:24:01.340]  Like, even radix means, like, to the root, right?
[02:24:01.399 --> 02:24:02.500]  Going to the root of the issue.
[02:24:03.020 --> 02:24:05.040]  And I think you're right with the word family.
[02:24:07.219 --> 02:24:10.420]  Viewing a nation as a family, I want to say something about the meaning of the words, though.
[02:24:10.520 --> 02:24:12.520]  Like, to be a patriot, right?
[02:24:12.799 --> 02:24:13.200]  Patriot.
[02:24:13.780 --> 02:24:17.700]  Requires a patria, a patria in Latin, which is country.
[02:24:18.459 --> 02:24:23.520]  And a country, in order to have a patria, you need to have a patriarch.
[02:24:24.299 --> 02:24:28.459]  So it's patriarch, patria, patriot, it's all related.
[02:24:28.719 --> 02:24:37.680]  But our problem here is we have people like Elon Musk, and he's representative, I do believe, of the chief error, which is that, look at his family!
[02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:39.649]  He's promiscuous.
[02:24:40.030 --> 02:24:46.329]  There's not a sense of, I'm bound in sacred covenant with one wife till I die.
[02:24:46.450 --> 02:24:48.450]  It's like, I have 50 kids.
[02:24:48.670 --> 02:24:50.690]  I'm always getting a different girl pregnant.
[02:24:50.989 --> 02:24:57.989]  He's fundamentally in error on the most crucial, on the crux of the issue, really.
[02:24:58.489 --> 02:24:59.090]  So...
[02:25:00.139 --> 02:25:09.079]  And on that point, and then I'll wrap up with these issues here, is that, I mean, I believe fundamentally this is of divine and prophetic significance.
[02:25:09.079 --> 02:25:24.319]  Like in Deuteronomy 28, verse 43, Yahweh Elohim, the Almighty God, says He Himself When a land forsakes the commandments, when they forsake the law, when they forsake the faith of their patriarch, right?
[02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:28.659]  The faith of the Puritans, the faith of the pilgrims, the people that made this place.
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:38.079]  Not the Freemason usurpers of 1788 with, you know, the consolidated constitution that destroyed the confederacy of sovereign states.
[02:25:38.459 --> 02:25:39.420]  Not that program.
[02:25:39.559 --> 02:25:41.739]  But when we've forsaken them, we're cursed.
[02:25:41.799 --> 02:25:43.059]  He says, all cause foreigners.
[02:25:43.239 --> 02:25:46.979]  God says he'll bring foreigners in to rise above the native population.
[02:25:47.629 --> 02:25:54.989]  And on that point, native means someone that's, you know, a nation has to have natives.
[02:25:55.209 --> 02:25:55.629]  They're born there.
[02:25:55.850 --> 02:26:05.229]  The two other points I'll be done quickly is Jesus says that in the end times there will be nation against nation, but in Greek that's ethnos, epi-ethnos.
[02:26:05.430 --> 02:26:09.350]  It's literally ethnicities on top of or against one another.
[02:26:10.729 --> 02:26:25.969]  And then the final master key, which I've never heard anybody say this, but I do believe it's I believe that ties into the last world empire set forth in an image or icon that Daniel saw, where the iron,
[02:26:26.670 --> 02:26:29.069]  the ten toes of Daniel.
[02:26:29.370 --> 02:26:35.809]  If you understand those ten toes mixed with iron and clay, one leg was in western Rome, right, in Rome.
[02:26:36.010 --> 02:26:40.069]  The other leg was in the east, Constantinople, which is the Middle East.
[02:26:40.780 --> 02:27:10.819]  And I believe what we see there is an image of the iron technologically advanced Europe being forced through some political scheme together with the Adobe or third world mud class of the Middle East and they're forcing it to happen and it doesn't cohere and that is a sign of the times that this is the final error and eventually we get this sentient AI image of the beast that everybody has to honor or you can't buy and sell and so My
[02:27:10.819 --> 02:27:25.110]  encouragement is we need to be thinking about these two wings of the great eagle and fleeing to the country because it says the dragon pursues with the flood This woman, and the land opens its mouth and swallows this persecutorial flood from the dragon.
[02:27:25.290 --> 02:27:26.889]  How does the land do that?
[02:27:27.090 --> 02:27:39.049]  To me, it has to be some sort of coalition of farmers providing food from the land, because when this social credit score B system comes, you're not going to get the necessaries of life which come from the land.
[02:27:39.209 --> 02:27:43.809]  So, to me, that's it, and thank you very much for your time.
[02:27:44.010 --> 02:27:44.950]  Wow, fascinating.
[02:27:45.790 --> 02:27:47.610]  That was a great call, Chase.
[02:27:47.770 --> 02:27:49.290]  That was very thorough.
[02:27:49.290 --> 02:28:05.850]  I agree with you very sincerely, and I'll just say that obviously what the globalists are doing now is they are at war with God, which means they're at war with nature, and they are very deliberately trying to destroy our ability to enjoy the bounty of God,
[02:28:05.850 --> 02:28:12.629]  the The ability to plant a seed in the ground and have it grow and give us 10 more seeds to plant 100 more plants.
[02:28:12.750 --> 02:28:20.510]  I mean, that is the beauty of the system that God set up that they're trying to supplant with a mechanized, industrialized replacement of it.
[02:28:21.340 --> 02:28:37.579]  And we see that very clearly, which is why, you know, when you talk about Elon Musk maybe being a bit off on the basics, you're talking there about, you know, patriarch, I won't necessarily comment on that, but one thing I've always wanted to ask Elon Musk is, like, what is the purpose of civilization?
[02:28:37.579 --> 02:28:38.860]  He's always talking about civilization.
[02:28:38.860 --> 02:28:40.559]  He says we need to preserve civilization.
[02:28:40.559 --> 02:28:44.200]  We need civilization to continue long enough to become a multi-planet species.
[02:28:44.379 --> 02:28:47.260]  Like, what is civilization, and what is the point of civilization?
[02:28:47.719 --> 02:28:49.040]  And is somewhere like...
[02:28:49.860 --> 02:28:55.780]  Is China civilized or is it highly refined and technologically advanced barbarism?
[02:28:56.159 --> 02:28:58.899]  What is civilization and what's the point of civilization?
[02:28:59.239 --> 02:29:01.860]  And is civilization worth it without liberty?
[02:29:02.059 --> 02:29:06.000]  Is not liberty the purpose and the reason why you want a civilization?
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.319]  Because with civilization you can have order.
[02:29:08.459 --> 02:29:09.860]  With order you can have peace.
[02:29:09.979 --> 02:29:11.079]  With peace you can have freedom.
[02:29:11.299 --> 02:29:12.940]  Is not freedom the ultimate goal?
[02:29:13.079 --> 02:29:16.399]  And civilization just to step towards that or maybe even a...
[02:29:16.959 --> 02:29:18.940]  A side effect of that.
[02:29:19.299 --> 02:29:22.959]  So I think, again, that this idea of civilization above all else.
[02:29:23.079 --> 02:29:29.819]  Well, if the mark of the beast system would be a civilization, it'd be a very advanced civilization where you can't buy anything without submitting to the beast.
[02:29:29.940 --> 02:29:32.780]  You can't grow your own food and it all comes out of a machine.
[02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:44.170]  The brave new world was a very advanced civilization where everybody willingly went and died at age 60. There was no marriage and no children and everybody was born out of a test tube.
[02:29:44.329 --> 02:29:45.270]  I mean, that's a civilization.
[02:29:45.590 --> 02:29:46.549]  Is that what you want?
[02:29:46.670 --> 02:29:51.989]  Or is there something more meaningful that civilization can help us get to but isn't sufficient in and of itself?
[02:29:52.209 --> 02:29:58.389]  So I think there are some fundamentals we need to get a hang on before we start, you know, going to the stars necessarily.
[02:29:58.870 --> 02:29:59.809]  Thanks so much for that call.
[02:29:59.909 --> 02:30:00.209]  That was great.
[02:30:00.290 --> 02:30:01.590]  Let's go to Craig in Ohio now.
[02:30:01.750 --> 02:30:02.610]  Let's talk about the economy.
[02:30:03.030 --> 02:30:03.510]  Go ahead, Craig.
[02:30:03.670 --> 02:30:04.030]  You're on the air.
[02:30:05.069 --> 02:30:05.729]  Hey, Erickson.
[02:30:05.909 --> 02:30:11.530]  So I kind of want to tag on to what the prior guy was saying and what you were just saying and connect some of this stuff with the economy.
[02:30:11.729 --> 02:30:15.770]  I mean, I think the same thing is what happened during Operation Paperclip, right?
[02:30:15.850 --> 02:30:21.090]  You're bringing over the best scientists, and then you're putting them in sort of a legal environment, right?
[02:30:21.389 --> 02:30:25.629]  Dropping them in the Pentagon, putting them all these different places, and they're sort of illegal, right?
[02:30:25.690 --> 02:30:26.569]  So now what do you have?
[02:30:26.670 --> 02:30:28.389]  You have controlled, smart people.
[02:30:28.670 --> 02:30:30.030]  It's kind of the same thing, right?
[02:30:30.110 --> 02:30:34.299]  And so you have Wealth and power transfer from World War I and World War II, right?
[02:30:34.459 --> 02:30:39.299]  And essentially, what we're really talking about here is one form of slavery or another, right?
[02:30:39.399 --> 02:30:43.319]  Economic slavery, you know, illegal migration slavery, right?
[02:30:43.420 --> 02:30:45.280]  Which we know the central banks were behind.
[02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:49.799]  We know the corporations fully supported it, all the migration across our southern border.
[02:30:50.280 --> 02:30:57.719]  And I guess the point of all this is, you know, to the economy, is that there's slavery going on every day in these markets, right?
[02:30:57.799 --> 02:30:58.700]  The financial markets.
[02:30:58.860 --> 02:31:05.670]  We have Right now, I mean, I'm sitting here watching the NASDAQ sold off 700 points today, the high-tech sector, right?
[02:31:05.850 --> 02:31:11.790]  You know, sold off 700 points straight down, and then they get done with it, and then they turn around and they take it straight back up again.
[02:31:12.389 --> 02:31:21.610]  And so all the people out there just take all their hard-earned savings that they worked their whole life for, and then they put it back in these funds, and these funds give their money to who?
[02:31:21.790 --> 02:31:22.829]  To BlackRock, right?
[02:31:22.889 --> 02:31:23.030]  Yep.
[02:31:23.909 --> 02:31:24.870]  To all these different people.
[02:31:24.989 --> 02:31:29.829]  And so we're feeding our own circular slavery system, you know, by being on this whole deal.
[02:31:30.010 --> 02:31:41.649]  And so what you were saying about, you know, finding a difference between, you know, like, you know, freedom and, you know, and this technocracy, right?
[02:31:41.770 --> 02:31:43.569]  This battle between good versus evil.
[02:31:43.889 --> 02:31:52.030]  It really comes down to, you know, how do you use math and harmonics and different things, vibrational patterns that exist out in the world, right?
[02:31:52.620 --> 02:31:59.840]  That God's put in place, you know, since the earth has been formed and how everything's connected, right?
[02:31:59.899 --> 02:32:06.559]  And I know this sounds a little bit crazy, but I've talked to you before on here, you know, and I do a show that deals with this stuff every single day, you know?
[02:32:06.920 --> 02:32:09.139]  And how do you find the truth in markets?
[02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:11.700]  I mean, a lot of this stuff's based on fear and greed.
[02:32:11.920 --> 02:32:15.700]  That's what allows us to get pushed around by these people is fear and greed, you know?
[02:32:15.760 --> 02:32:24.379]  And so how do you take that fear and greed away by understanding what the truth is And once you understand what the truth is, now you can go into it honestly.
[02:32:24.620 --> 02:32:29.600]  You know, everybody was so negative to U.S. dollars just three months ago, you know, two months before Trump came in.
[02:32:29.680 --> 02:32:32.600]  I mean, you couldn't find a single soul that would buy the U.S. dollar.
[02:32:32.940 --> 02:32:37.379]  And I'm sitting there saying, like, look, if Trump gets in, his dollar is going to fly to the moon, right?
[02:32:37.420 --> 02:32:38.700]  And sure enough, here it is, right?
[02:32:38.739 --> 02:32:42.459]  So I hope all that stuff makes sense to the listeners out there, right?
[02:32:42.559 --> 02:32:44.260]  That all this stuff's connected, right?
[02:32:44.420 --> 02:32:45.319]  Don't be a slave.
[02:32:45.639 --> 02:32:46.920]  Choose not to be a slave.
[02:32:47.180 --> 02:32:48.479]  You know, choose to find the truth.
[02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:51.649]  You know, choose good versus evil.
[02:32:51.889 --> 02:32:54.969]  You know, Elon Musk clearly has an agenda, right?
[02:32:54.969 --> 02:32:59.950]  We can go back to Zip 2 in 95. We can go to, you know, we can go through it all.
[02:33:00.090 --> 02:33:02.290]  PayPal, X.com, SpaceX, right?
[02:33:02.370 --> 02:33:03.950]  X.com didn't just come about.
[02:33:04.110 --> 02:33:06.049]  He had that form before 2000, right?
[02:33:06.209 --> 02:33:07.969]  So he just rolled Twitter.
[02:33:08.170 --> 02:33:10.690]  So there's clearly an agenda here by this guy.
[02:33:10.750 --> 02:33:26.079]  And the question is, you know, is he out for the good of man or is he just really the Pentagon, you know, bringing in Yeah, and there's a lot of speculation about that, and I know a lot of people, it's kind of frustrating,
[02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:30.719]  people put out like, you don't realize what you're serving, it's like...
[02:33:32.180 --> 02:33:34.079]  This is what you saw over the last 48 hours.
[02:33:34.219 --> 02:33:43.479]  You saw that when Elon Musk goes against the will of the people, the people will rise up and argue with him and, you know, ratio him, sort of make a fool out of him.
[02:33:43.540 --> 02:33:50.159]  And he walked it back a little bit and he sort of, you know, called people trolls and it was not the greatest victory.
[02:33:50.280 --> 02:33:52.479]  Nobody is, you know...
[02:33:53.110 --> 02:34:14.829]  Willfully blind to some of the things Elon Musk is up to, the brain chips and how he is in a way contributing to the you will own nothing and be happy motto of the World Economic Forum because he wants to be the car fleet that replaces ownership of cars.
[02:34:14.989 --> 02:34:15.969]  You won't own cars anymore.
[02:34:15.969 --> 02:34:20.790]  Tesla will just have automated cars that will drive around and pick you up if your social credit score is high enough.
[02:34:21.450 --> 02:34:22.309]  Everybody's aware of that.
[02:34:22.430 --> 02:34:32.729]  However, the tangible things that he has brought have been hugely beneficial, and you can't just ignore that or act like that's a fluke or doesn't exist.
[02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:36.690]  He has brought free speech back to X. What we're seeing now is a consequence of that.
[02:34:36.829 --> 02:34:39.930]  He helped Trump get over the finish line, especially in places like Pennsylvania.
[02:34:40.190 --> 02:34:41.709]  You can't underestimate that.
[02:34:42.719 --> 02:34:45.479]  People want to either have a black and white view on this issue.
[02:34:45.659 --> 02:34:48.920]  I think it's a little bit more gray and nuanced when it comes to Elon Musk.
[02:34:49.040 --> 02:34:56.239]  And I'll celebrate him for the great stuff that he does that's good and contradict or argue against him when I think he's taking the wrong attack.
[02:34:56.459 --> 02:34:59.819]  So, you know, it's not extreme here.
[02:34:59.940 --> 02:35:01.659]  It's very pragmatic, in my opinion.
[02:35:01.860 --> 02:35:02.620]  Thank you for that call, Craig.
[02:35:02.799 --> 02:35:04.420]  Let's go to Ms. Liu in Florida.
[02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:07.379]  Ms. Liu is called in about the HB1 scandal.
[02:35:07.379 --> 02:35:08.600]  Go ahead, Ms. Liu, you're on the air.
[02:35:09.159 --> 02:35:10.459]  Hey, good morning, Harrison.
[02:35:10.899 --> 02:35:12.540]  Listen, you've done a great job.
[02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:14.899]  All this stuff is laying it out.
[02:35:15.139 --> 02:35:18.020]  So, if you agree or disagree, people can make a choice on that.
[02:35:18.239 --> 02:35:20.739]  And your assessment of Elon, I think, is correct.
[02:35:20.959 --> 02:35:23.260]  I think, at this point, to paint in black or white is silly.
[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:33.180]  But, in any case, I think we have a core problem in this country, which is leading to all these issues about STEM. They have, for years, denied Americans education.
[02:35:33.579 --> 02:35:34.379]  True education.
[02:35:34.579 --> 02:35:35.440]  Not indoctrination.
[02:35:35.700 --> 02:35:36.100]  Education.
[02:35:36.260 --> 02:35:41.309]  And I'm talking from Smaller schools all the way up to the universities, which we pay for.
[02:35:41.649 --> 02:35:44.530]  Bring in foreigns who are from other schools.
[02:35:44.670 --> 02:35:45.649]  I'm not going to single out India.
[02:35:45.729 --> 02:35:48.670]  I lived in India for two years, so I'm not going to be prejudiced against Indian.
[02:35:48.829 --> 02:35:56.370]  But they do have a huge population, many of them bent on coming here and continuing their education, which we subsidize.
[02:35:56.989 --> 02:36:02.030]  So now if they come in and replace Americans who are applying for these engineering jobs, okay?
[02:36:02.190 --> 02:36:04.850]  We're not talking about Americans who want to be plumbers.
[02:36:04.969 --> 02:36:06.329]  And that's fine, 100%.
[02:36:06.329 --> 02:36:07.250]  We need...
[02:36:07.700 --> 02:36:10.459]  We need workers across all spectrums, okay?
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:14.579]  They want to call the people who use their hands deplorables and that Walmart smells.
[02:36:14.700 --> 02:36:22.600]  Yeah, well, you can go into a fancy store on Madison Avenue and it can smell, too, of elitism and snobbism.
[02:36:23.260 --> 02:36:25.920]  So both extremes are not good.
[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:28.620]  We have to embrace each other as Americans.
[02:36:28.879 --> 02:36:31.659]  But number one, it has to be America first.
[02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:37.870]  Now, we've got 20 million illegal people in this country We're not going to assimilate so much.
[02:36:38.069 --> 02:36:40.129]  They're creating their own communities.
[02:36:40.270 --> 02:36:43.930]  We are feeding them, paying for them, paying for their health care.
[02:36:44.290 --> 02:36:49.870]  And meanwhile, Americans can't pay their rent or their grocery bills while everybody else is coming in.
[02:36:50.090 --> 02:37:05.549]  Now, as you pointed out, if they want to, if Elon Musk and all these guys in high tech want to bring in, whether it's from China or Taiwan, and I think there is a national security issue here that has to be looked at, But if they want to bring from India,
[02:37:05.870 --> 02:37:21.850]  England, wherever, if they get a student or students that look like they qualify for the other, you know, super smart, super great visas, there have to be conditions on them accepting train-ups in the field that we pay for.
[02:37:22.979 --> 02:37:25.159]  Yeah, no, I agree.
[02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:29.280]  And, you know, this video went viral a little while ago.
[02:37:30.399 --> 02:37:33.459]  Antunes1 on X just reposted it.
[02:37:33.639 --> 02:37:36.200]  It's a white guy who just graduated high school.
[02:37:36.379 --> 02:37:38.159]  He was number one in his class.
[02:37:38.299 --> 02:37:39.940]  His GPA was 5.09.
[02:37:39.940 --> 02:37:43.399]  His ACT was 35. He was the vice president of his class.
[02:37:43.540 --> 02:37:47.120]  And yet he was rejected from basically every school ever.
[02:37:47.549 --> 02:38:02.680]  Out there, and the crew can find it, Antunes, A-N-T-U-N-E-S-1 on X. And, you know, this is such a condemnation of our entire system that And it's a self-fulfilling thing, too.
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:08.639]  Why should white guys try and strive and do the necessary work to be the best?
[02:38:08.739 --> 02:38:11.860]  Do you have any idea how hard it is to be number one in your class?
[02:38:11.959 --> 02:38:19.520]  You've really got to dedicate yourself to that and at the sacrifice of a lot more fun things that you could be doing as a high schooler.
[02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:26.379]  Why would you dedicate yourself to that if you're rejected from Rice University, Harvard, Yale, Columbia?
[02:38:26.639 --> 02:38:28.399]  I mean, it goes on and on everywhere.
[02:38:29.020 --> 02:38:40.120]  Rejected him, even though he was number one in his class with a GPA of 5.09 and incredible auxiliary accomplishments like being the vice president.
[02:38:40.280 --> 02:38:41.200]  Columbia rejected him.
[02:38:41.319 --> 02:38:42.420]  Stanford rejected him.
[02:38:42.700 --> 02:38:43.559]  Harvard rejected him.
[02:38:43.620 --> 02:38:44.360]  Yale rejected him.
[02:38:44.459 --> 02:38:45.280]  Rice rejected him.
[02:38:45.620 --> 02:38:46.600]  MIT rejected him.
[02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:47.860]  He got rejected everywhere.
[02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:05.979]  We're good to go.
[02:39:11.149 --> 02:39:19.549]  Why am I going to dedicate myself to being the best if even if I'm the best, I am still not going to get accepted to any school, and I'm still not going to get the best job.
[02:39:19.690 --> 02:39:21.569]  So it's not just about job placement.
[02:39:21.750 --> 02:39:34.129]  It's about the way that especially native-born white Americans are discriminated against continuously from elementary school all the way up to placement in college.
[02:39:35.450 --> 02:39:39.329]  In employment following graduation, he got rejected from Duke.
[02:39:39.729 --> 02:39:41.250]  He got rejected from all of them.
[02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:42.590]  All of them.
[02:39:42.750 --> 02:39:46.049]  And he literally could not have done more, could not have done better.
[02:39:46.549 --> 02:39:49.010]  Why would anybody else try after that?
[02:39:49.190 --> 02:39:59.629]  So, you know, these things have been put in place deliberately to discriminate against the non-diverse people, that is, white males, Christians especially.
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.239]  Let's go to Robert in Oregon now.
[02:40:03.399 --> 02:40:05.799]  Robert in Oregon, you're on the air, sir.
[02:40:05.899 --> 02:40:06.120]  Go ahead.
[02:40:07.059 --> 02:40:08.399]  Harrison, God bless.
[02:40:09.899 --> 02:40:13.659]  Soon I'll be on this earth 65 years.
[02:40:14.540 --> 02:40:20.799]  I've watched this country change in ways that a lot of you young folks haven't experienced.
[02:40:21.479 --> 02:40:31.379]  And what the problem, the real problem, It's the laws that are passed and how padded they are with all these expenditures that we know nothing about.
[02:40:31.659 --> 02:40:40.100]  Even the people in Congress, both sides, have minutes, sometimes no tone, to review these things.
[02:40:40.979 --> 02:40:44.860]  That's one of the root problems, the laws that are passed.
[02:40:45.340 --> 02:40:49.620]  The power has been stripped year by year by year.
[02:40:50.200 --> 02:40:51.459]  Of the American voice.
[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:56.979]  Now take apart, and let's stand apart of the racism that's involved.
[02:40:57.379 --> 02:41:00.420]  But the people need to have a voice.
[02:41:00.959 --> 02:41:04.500]  The sham that's been pulled over all of our eyes.
[02:41:06.059 --> 02:41:11.559]  The soap opera of Republican, Democrat, horse crap.
[02:41:12.159 --> 02:41:14.260]  The American people have no voice.
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:31.450]  Now, with Elon Musk, the other things, I go from a biblical standpoint, and Jonathan Cahn, Rabbi Jonathan Cahn, and the books that he's wrote, basically, revelations coming true in all of his books,
[02:41:31.489 --> 02:41:33.670]  and the events that happen.
[02:41:33.870 --> 02:41:38.709]  I would tell people, the Jewish people are the ones who put Christ on the cross.
[02:41:39.209 --> 02:41:41.129]  Pilate washed his hands, big deal.
[02:41:42.069 --> 02:41:48.719]  The Jewish people that turn their heart to the Lord, Are very, very blessed.
[02:41:50.780 --> 02:42:01.540]  That's just something that people, I would like to relay that, so that if anyone is seeking the truth, to consider Jonathan Cahn.
[02:42:01.819 --> 02:42:05.219]  The man is truly touched by the Lord.
[02:42:05.840 --> 02:42:07.120]  But back to the subject.
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:19.659]  In order to have a voice, And to be able to rise above these two parties with all these bills that are being passed into law that are the root cause of our problems, we have to have a voice.
[02:42:20.280 --> 02:42:26.100]  Now, with Donald Trump coming into office, I think this country finally has a chance to have a voice.
[02:42:27.180 --> 02:42:32.680]  Anyone that votes in the future by law should have to have a voter ID card.
[02:42:32.879 --> 02:42:34.399]  I don't care where they're from.
[02:42:35.219 --> 02:42:36.360]  A true American.
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:50.090]  And in having that card have the right To review these bills and have enough time to review these bills, to have a voice of not one, but millions, millions upon millions.
[02:42:50.389 --> 02:42:50.889]  Absolutely.
[02:42:51.149 --> 02:42:54.409]  And I think there's a real opportunity to achieve that right now.
[02:42:54.569 --> 02:43:07.829]  It does seem like the division between the right and the left is becoming less certain, a little bit more obscured, and there's a real opportunity here to have a true populist movement rise up against the powers that be.
[02:43:27.549 --> 02:43:33.790]  I'm sorry, Ryan in Idaho has an interesting position here.
[02:43:33.930 --> 02:43:34.930]  Go ahead, Ryan, you're on the air.
[02:43:35.750 --> 02:43:36.370]  Hey, Harrison.
[02:43:36.709 --> 02:43:37.649]  I love you guys, man.
[02:43:37.670 --> 02:43:38.709]  I've been a big supporter.
[02:43:38.889 --> 02:43:39.790]  I just wanted to say that.
[02:43:40.250 --> 02:43:40.530]  Thank you.
[02:43:40.790 --> 02:43:43.370]  Just, you know, eye-to-eye and all that stuff.
[02:43:44.170 --> 02:43:50.129]  I've been hooked up to the Alex Jones, I think, VIP member.
[02:43:50.270 --> 02:43:54.309]  So I get my $30 or my $40 for my $30, you know?
[02:43:54.750 --> 02:43:55.069]  Excellent.
[02:43:55.209 --> 02:43:57.030]  Yes, thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:43:57.170 --> 02:44:00.450]  Sign up to be a VIP member and experience all of the benefits.
[02:44:00.629 --> 02:44:01.049]  They're incredible.
[02:44:01.190 --> 02:44:02.610]  Thank you for that, Ryan.
[02:44:02.790 --> 02:44:04.389]  But I know that's not what you called in about.
[02:44:04.389 --> 02:44:04.690]  Go ahead.
[02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:10.190]  Yeah, so the point is, I really enjoy the topic here.
[02:44:10.370 --> 02:44:11.549]  I work in the industry.
[02:44:11.549 --> 02:44:12.850]  I'm not going to say where I work.
[02:44:12.909 --> 02:44:13.569]  Can't do that.
[02:44:13.969 --> 02:44:21.610]  But I work in the tech industry, and I've been noticing this for a few years.
[02:44:23.170 --> 02:44:28.670]  Four years ago, man, they'd move you out where I live, and they'd pay for it, all that stuff.
[02:44:28.870 --> 02:44:31.409]  But I just see people getting dropped left and right.
[02:44:31.750 --> 02:44:33.790]  And a lot of the work...
[02:44:34.469 --> 02:44:36.870]  In my industry has been going to India.
[02:44:37.629 --> 02:44:39.569]  And it's actually been...
[02:44:39.569 --> 02:44:42.229]  It's been outsourced overseas.
[02:44:43.110 --> 02:44:43.690]  Right?
[02:44:43.950 --> 02:44:44.389]  So...
[02:44:44.389 --> 02:44:46.489]  They're not even doing it...
[02:44:46.489 --> 02:44:48.649]  They're not even doing it like...
[02:44:48.649 --> 02:44:50.229]  You know, where they're moving in.
[02:44:50.430 --> 02:44:52.909]  Like a lot of the earlier callers were saying.
[02:44:53.489 --> 02:44:54.149]  It's...
[02:44:54.149 --> 02:44:55.889]  We're seeing it just go.
[02:44:57.270 --> 02:45:02.670]  I'm blessed enough to be in a fairly senior level position to where...
[02:45:02.670 --> 02:45:03.750]  You know...
[02:45:04.750 --> 02:45:06.370]  I still have a job, right?
[02:45:06.629 --> 02:45:14.030]  But what I'm seeing is people like me, I spend my day training these guys.
[02:45:14.670 --> 02:45:23.610]  And if you don't know, India is probably 11 and a half, 12 and a half hours difference from where I am.
[02:45:23.989 --> 02:45:26.930]  But it's cheaper labor.
[02:45:28.450 --> 02:45:31.309]  And they can pay cheaper over there.
[02:45:32.049 --> 02:45:33.309]  So it's...
[02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:48.920]  It's interesting to see that post that you brought up because it hits a little bit harder because it's like, hey, you know, the people that are signing those checks and making those decisions are just looking at a spreadsheet.
[02:45:50.550 --> 02:45:54.430]  Right, they're not thinking about the effect that they're having on people.
[02:45:54.549 --> 02:45:57.989]  And look, this is just, it's an aspect of our broken system.
[02:45:58.149 --> 02:46:02.530]  And a lot of it has to do with the DEI ESG scores they go on.
[02:46:02.590 --> 02:46:05.690]  I'm constantly reminded of, I had a friend that worked at Whole Foods.
[02:46:05.790 --> 02:46:10.409]  They worked at the headquarters here in Austin, doing things for the corporate entity of Whole Foods.
[02:46:10.930 --> 02:46:13.909]  And Whole Foods was trying to be purchased by Amazon.
[02:46:14.069 --> 02:46:15.350]  It was right before they got purchased.
[02:46:15.930 --> 02:46:17.850]  And I did some work for them.
[02:46:18.690 --> 02:46:20.250]  Where it was all very...
[02:46:21.479 --> 02:46:22.899]  It was a scam, basically.
[02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:30.780]  It was like they were having me set up this office to look like they were doing this new program where they were going to attract all these young people.
[02:46:30.920 --> 02:46:38.659]  And the whole thing was just a presentation to give at a stockholder meeting in New York to pump up that stock price right before they were bought by Amazon.
[02:46:38.659 --> 02:46:40.840]  It was nothing they'd ever actually intended on implementing.
[02:46:40.879 --> 02:46:43.079]  It was a show they put on to pump their stock price.
[02:46:43.239 --> 02:46:48.540]  Same thing, I had a friend that worked at Whole Foods, and he would be talking to me and going, yeah, it's weird, man.
[02:46:48.620 --> 02:46:49.620]  We hired a girl.
[02:46:50.180 --> 02:46:51.780]  And we don't need another employee.
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:53.120]  But I'm training her.
[02:46:53.260 --> 02:46:55.340]  But I'm like, I don't know what you're going to be doing.
[02:46:56.379 --> 02:46:58.479]  And I had to tell him, dude, she's going to replace you.
[02:46:58.579 --> 02:46:59.559]  You get what's going on here.
[02:46:59.700 --> 02:47:05.879]  They want a higher diversity score because apparently that's how you value a company now is how many women and non-white people you have.
[02:47:06.420 --> 02:47:08.500]  And so I had white guy friends.
[02:47:08.559 --> 02:47:09.319]  Actually, this guy was Jewish.
[02:47:09.500 --> 02:47:12.100]  But either way, he was confused.
[02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:14.260]  He was like, why are we hiring these people if we don't need them?
[02:47:14.299 --> 02:47:14.719]  And sure enough...
[02:47:15.309 --> 02:47:21.110]  After training them for a week or two, he got fired, and Whole Foods was sold to Amazon.
[02:47:21.110 --> 02:47:28.090]  It was all about pumping up this totally arbitrary metric of ESG scores to get the highest payment from Amazon.
[02:47:28.290 --> 02:47:35.530]  So this stuff is destroying people's lives and getting people fired all over the place, and you don't even hear about it unless we report it here on Infowars.
[02:47:35.709 --> 02:47:36.809]  I think that's going to be it for me.
[02:47:36.930 --> 02:47:40.930]  Enjoy Jay Dyer in the fourth hour of The Alex Jones Show.

[02:47:43.389 --> 02:47:45.549]  Bladder rack and burdock root.
[02:47:45.850 --> 02:47:51.649]  Those aren't very sexy names, but what they do as superfoods is amazing.
[02:47:51.850 --> 02:48:08.010]  Then you add that to the superfood, Irish sea moss, and you are talking about glowing skin, weight loss, Mental clarity, focus, boosted immune system, all your electrochemical systems just operate in such a smooth way.
[02:48:08.489 --> 02:48:12.290]  That's why in the last three or four months, I've lost so much weight.
[02:48:12.389 --> 02:48:13.569]  I was already exercising.
[02:48:13.770 --> 02:48:19.989]  I was already taking some of the other supplements, but I was eating too much and I wasn't getting some of the other key nutrients I needed.
[02:48:20.170 --> 02:48:29.639]  And I'm telling you, when I got on Ultimate CMOS from the alexjonesstore.com, I saw dramatic effects and I religiously take Two capsules a day.
[02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:31.340]  That's the recommended amount.
[02:48:31.680 --> 02:48:36.639]  And that's the equivalent of 40 grams of Irish sea moss concentrated.
[02:48:37.100 --> 02:48:40.440]  And then you get the other superfoods in there as well.
[02:48:40.559 --> 02:48:44.219]  And it would take me 10 minutes to just break down what the other ingredients do.
[02:48:44.299 --> 02:48:51.149]  But please, Research these ingredients for yourself and find out why this is such an amazing formula.

[02:51:45.280 --> 02:51:46.260]  This is The Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:46.399 --> 02:51:48.500]  I'm Harrison Smith, sitting in for Alex.
[02:51:48.819 --> 02:51:54.899]  Jay Dyer will be taking over for me after this short, top-of-the-hour, five-minute break.
[02:51:54.899 --> 02:52:07.500]  And I'm glad I got this extra few minutes Let's talk about Vivek Ramaswamy's statement where he said that basically he was criticizing American culture.
[02:52:07.680 --> 02:52:27.219]  And he's talking about the fact that, and it's true to some extent, you know, the American culture Family is more likely to be camping on the weekend rather than training for some hardcore piano recital or something like that.
[02:52:27.340 --> 02:52:36.200]  There's a certain emphasis on academic and achievement like that in foreigners who arrive here in America.
[02:52:36.420 --> 02:52:53.299]  And all that means to me is that we've got some stiff competition and we have to Be our best and be at our best in order to retain our position here as Americans on top of the world and as the greatest country,
[02:52:53.579 --> 02:52:55.780]  most powerful nation to ever exist in history.
[02:52:56.440 --> 02:53:07.819]  Vivek Ramaswamy said, the reason top tech companies hire foreign-born and first-generation engineers over Native Americans isn't because of an innate American IQ deficit, a lazy and wrong explanation.
[02:53:08.100 --> 02:53:11.100]  The key part of it comes down to the C word, culture.
[02:53:11.659 --> 02:53:13.000]  Tough questions demand tough answers.
[02:53:13.260 --> 02:53:16.459]  And if we're really serious about fixing the problem, we have to confront the truth.
[02:53:16.659 --> 02:53:23.420]  Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long, at least since the 90s and likely longer.
[02:53:23.579 --> 02:53:24.440]  That doesn't start in college.
[02:53:24.440 --> 02:53:25.219]  It starts young.
[02:53:25.399 --> 02:53:27.180]  Now, a lot of people were offended by this.
[02:53:27.360 --> 02:53:29.379]  I'm rather offended by this as well.
[02:53:29.760 --> 02:53:30.840]  And yet...
[02:53:32.190 --> 02:53:34.569]  What you have to recognize is that this is deliberate.
[02:53:34.850 --> 02:53:35.670]  This is on purpose.
[02:53:35.969 --> 02:53:42.909]  It's not because Americans as a collective just decided one day to be weak and lazy and stupid.
[02:53:42.909 --> 02:53:53.309]  It's because our culture has been deliberately designed to weaken, impoverish, and compel us to be lazy and unexceptional.
[02:53:53.530 --> 02:53:58.190]  So I think that might be the delineation of people reading this.
[02:53:58.270 --> 02:54:12.879]  Some people see this We're good to go.
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:22.280]  And it's okay.
[02:54:22.479 --> 02:54:23.100]  It's okay.
[02:54:23.620 --> 02:54:26.860]  The first step in combating this is knowing about it.
[02:54:27.020 --> 02:54:32.120]  The second step is taking those steps necessary to reverse and overcome it.
[02:54:32.260 --> 02:54:39.860]  So it's not just that our media has been absolute trash celebrating and venerating the most pathetic people in the world.
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:43.860]  I mean, think about Alex Jones is probably the best rant of all time, his Justin Bieber rant.
[02:54:44.010 --> 02:54:59.090]  Isn't that rant about the shoving down the throat of the American youth, these pathetic, weak, unaccomplished losers like Justin Bieber over the heroes of history who we should be venerating, who we should be working to be like?
[02:55:00.329 --> 02:55:05.969]  In a way, Vivek Ramaswamy is right, but you have to understand that that's because America is under attack.
[02:55:06.110 --> 02:55:20.930]  The American people have been under attack, and it's not just psychologically through the media and through the programming and academia and all this stuff that is telling us to devolve to the lowest common denominator and to despise the exceptional and celebrate the...
[02:55:23.489 --> 02:55:33.629]  It's also chemically and physically attacking us by lowering our testosterone, the poisons in the food and water, the atrazine that's now a main topic of conversation.
[02:55:33.829 --> 02:55:41.690]  So if you want to fight back against that in particular, might I suggest you go to Dr. Jones Naturals and get yourself Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:55:41.729 --> 02:56:04.360]  You could take a variety of different supplements and all sorts of different capsules and pills and try to make up We're good to go.
[02:56:09.540 --> 02:56:18.940]  It has 100% daily value, but much more than that of all of the vitamins and minerals that you need, all the ones you can name, C, D, E, A, I mean, literally all of them.
[02:56:19.079 --> 02:56:30.780]  So you can either have a giant cabinet full of pill bottles, or you can have one delicious scoop of vitamin-mineral fusion now on sale at drjonesnaturals.com to fight back against mediocrity.
[02:56:31.079 --> 02:56:32.700]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:56:32.700 --> 02:56:34.319]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:50.139]  And we're going to be talking about something appropriate Today's drama on Twitter, and it goes along with what Harrison was talking about as well, which is this idea that America wasn't just some random country that was mediocre by accident.
[02:56:50.719 --> 02:57:07.659]  America was subjected to very intense levels of psychological warfare, attacks through the food, attacks through the culture that resulted in the degradation of the society and into the Halfway collapse that we're already seeing.
[02:57:08.020 --> 02:57:11.959]  The question is, how do we get here and how do we get out of this?
[02:57:12.200 --> 02:57:19.139]  I think in order to understand how we got there, it's good to read people that talked about this and what was coming back in the 1990s.
[02:57:19.260 --> 02:57:31.219]  In fact, there was a book written in 1992 that talked about the entirety of this plan being rolled out by our day, and particularly bringing in foreign entities, weapons of mass migration, so to speak.
[02:57:32.409 --> 02:57:45.510]  And what effect that would have on the native population, combined with the toxic culture, combined with all the other elements that were part of the Tavistock New World Order, you could say, Club of Rome plan.
[02:57:45.690 --> 02:57:57.750]  In fact, one member of the Club of Rome went and talked to people in the White House back in the 1970s, and they were talking about different projects and entities that they could use to bring about these plans.
[02:57:58.250 --> 02:58:13.729]  You've heard me talk before about the discussions with Kissinger during that time period when Kissinger really adopted the eugenics Malthusian worldview, not just for the third world like most people think, but actually for the entire Western world.
[02:58:14.129 --> 02:58:19.450]  And so part of this plan, it's known as the 2025 report or the 2020 report.
[02:58:19.690 --> 02:58:37.149]  You can find different versions of it, but In the very prophetic book written by a former British intelligence operative, Dr. John Coleman, he lists a series of things that they would plan—this is back in the 70s—that they would try to roll out within the next several decades.
[02:58:37.690 --> 02:58:43.649]  And I'm going to read some of the elements of this, and we're going to see what we think in terms of how much of this has come to pass.
[02:58:44.129 --> 02:59:12.780]  And you're going to notice that the open borders agenda is also a huge part of this plan, and it was— The first element that was listed in this discussion from the New World Order was the creation,
[02:59:12.920 --> 02:59:15.319]  first and foremost, of a One World Order.
[02:59:16.319 --> 02:59:35.139]  This one world order needed, first of all, a unified religion, a kind of new world order church, so to speak, as well as a one world government that would be set up sometime around perhaps the 1920s and 30s, at least modeled on what was set up in the 20s and 30s with the League of Nations and then the later United Nations.
[02:59:35.139 --> 02:59:44.440]  That would have to be probably replaced down the road or it would have to be given some kind of new authority and power rather than just being some sort of cultural debate for them.
[02:59:45.949 --> 02:59:57.450]  This religion would need to be based on a mix of the other religions, probably something like a blended Christianity or Islam or something New Age, Chrislam or something New Age.
[02:59:57.510 --> 03:00:08.690]  And we already see, by the way, of course, the Vatican pushing the idea of the monotheistic faith center where all of the religions are really combined in the Abu Dhabi faith center.
[03:00:09.530 --> 03:00:15.270]  Number two would be the removal and the destruction of all nation-state identity and national pride.
[03:00:15.450 --> 03:00:19.110]  That would have to be demonized and classed under racism.
[03:00:19.329 --> 03:00:23.489]  Of course, we've seen that immensely and pushed out in the last 20 years.
[03:00:23.989 --> 03:00:26.110]  I think?
[03:00:43.700 --> 03:00:44.860]  A flyover country.
[03:00:45.120 --> 03:00:54.159]  So they push the brainwashing and then the graduates then go into corporations, HR, you know, they become sort of the spokesman.
[03:00:54.340 --> 03:01:07.620]  And then that is what results in the corporations eventually after several years, you know, becoming woke because the people who go into the corporations have been through the corporate brainwashing system of the university.
[03:01:08.270 --> 03:01:12.090]  Now, you might think, well, the university is a state thing, or it's perhaps private.
[03:01:12.450 --> 03:01:14.790]  All of these entities are really joined at the top.
[03:01:14.950 --> 03:01:15.270]  That's the point.
[03:01:15.370 --> 03:01:34.690]  It doesn't really matter whether we're talking about public or private at this level, because this plan was essentially a private corporate plan that really took over government a long time ago, or you could say it took over the government in various stages to entrench itself and to really push the same agenda and the same plan.
[03:01:35.209 --> 03:01:36.750]  And it became eventually global.
[03:01:36.870 --> 03:01:53.649]  And I think everybody saw that in the COVID era because the entire world, in terms of the Fortune 100, Fortune 500, was enforcing the same policies, pushing the same hashtags, pushing all the same, you know, put this black image in your profile picture,
[03:01:53.909 --> 03:01:59.649]  or you're racist, you know, wear a mask, social distance, get your stabbies.
[03:02:00.010 --> 03:02:04.469]  Basically, every corporation in the world, Megacorp, was on board with that.
[03:02:05.950 --> 03:02:13.270]  And that shows that there's already sort of an entrenched governing body of corporate elites and government elites.
[03:02:13.270 --> 03:02:14.350]  They all collude together.
[03:02:14.350 --> 03:02:20.270]  It's a revolving door at a very high level that are planning a corporate technocratic socialism.
[03:02:21.450 --> 03:02:23.850]  Where do we get corporate technocratic socialism?
[03:02:24.090 --> 03:02:31.729]  Well, we have to go back to what John Coleman wrote this book about, The Committee of 300, which is the British East India Company.
[03:02:31.930 --> 03:02:35.430]  And this became really the ultimate corporation of its time.
[03:02:35.590 --> 03:02:42.670]  It was making more money in a day or a week than even if we adjust for, you know, the time difference.
[03:02:43.049 --> 03:02:44.670]  Even corporations today.
[03:02:44.930 --> 03:02:47.030]  So probably bigger than Apple or something like that.
[03:02:47.270 --> 03:02:51.549]  And so they were really above the government even.
[03:02:51.790 --> 03:02:53.670]  They could do pretty much whatever they wanted.
[03:02:53.670 --> 03:02:59.170]  And they didn't just specialize in Furs and goods like that.
[03:02:59.350 --> 03:03:07.790]  They also specialized in slave trade and narcotics, opium, all kinds of goods, so to speak.
[03:03:08.129 --> 03:03:12.750]  So this was really a corporate slavery that existed under the British East India Company.
[03:03:14.270 --> 03:03:17.290]  And they were really tied at the hip to the British government.
[03:03:17.290 --> 03:03:20.450]  So there wasn't really a difference between these two entities.
[03:03:20.629 --> 03:03:26.250]  And one could even argue that corporate governance I think?
[03:03:43.860 --> 03:03:54.920]  Liquidity and secrecy for Black operations during the Cold War, particularly drug running, drug trafficking, arms running, and Operation Gladio, which we've covered many, many times.
[03:03:56.799 --> 03:04:03.200]  So the corporate model functions as a perfect sort of inner, almost roundtable model.
[03:04:03.319 --> 03:04:17.790]  If you look at the Roundtable Society group out of the UK and Cecil Rhodes and those characters, really their secret model of an inner core elite of 12 people that they originally planned, it's kind of like a corporate governing board.
[03:04:18.209 --> 03:04:21.229]  So they're just calling it the Roundtable and the Wise Men.
[03:04:21.409 --> 03:04:24.409]  But it's the same type of structure of a kind of...
[03:04:27.630 --> 03:04:35.909]  It's like Plato's Council of the Night, which exists in his later works, where the Republic Magnesia is no longer run by one philosopher king.
[03:04:35.909 --> 03:04:40.489]  It's actually run by a board of oligarchs or basically intelligence operatives.
[03:04:40.940 --> 03:04:50.840]  Because if you listen to Plato, he describes that the governance board of Magnesia meets at night, hence they're the Council of Night, because they operate in secrecy.
[03:04:51.319 --> 03:05:00.979]  They send out spies, they govern the country without the knowledge of the people, because of course the people are too stupid and they need to be governed by this kind of esoteric elite.
[03:05:01.399 --> 03:05:16.920]  And interestingly, John Coleman in his book, I'm not saying I agree with everything in his book, I think he got some things wrong, but Writing this in 1992 is pretty profound because he was way ahead of his time, especially with the calls for technocracy and open border that he predicted,
[03:05:17.100 --> 03:05:21.479]  that that would be really essential to this plan and that it would roll that out in the next several decades.
[03:05:22.020 --> 03:05:32.979]  He goes on to talk about the destruction of the idea of American patriotism and pride, the destruction of all religions as they are known, and particularly the Christian religion.
[03:05:33.409 --> 03:05:42.049]  Isn't it interesting that they have to really destroy Christianity because that's the linchpin upon which Western civilization is built, and ideologically speaking.
[03:05:42.389 --> 03:05:49.049]  And that really means all the branches of Christianity, Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, and even Protestantism.
[03:05:49.049 --> 03:05:58.649]  They all have to really be diluted, infiltrated, destroyed from within, or co-opted to become just sort of cutouts for Christianity.
[03:06:01.540 --> 03:06:05.760]  We're good to go.
[03:06:05.760 --> 03:06:13.840]  We're good to go.
[03:06:26.429 --> 03:06:30.590]  Through some form of electronic or some form of mind control.
[03:06:31.149 --> 03:06:37.409]  And this is his definition of technocracy, and he's gotten it from Brzezinski's book from 1973, Between Two Ages.
[03:06:37.690 --> 03:06:39.250]  We've covered that many, many, many times.
[03:06:39.370 --> 03:06:40.250]  I'm not going to rehearse all that.
[03:06:40.489 --> 03:07:00.239]  But basically, the idea would be to robotize man, to make man more and more robotic, be that through a feedback loop of the information that he gets through the internet, making him more and more of a kind of a spurred Or through actual modification of humans through implantable chips,
[03:07:00.440 --> 03:07:04.260]  nanotech, signals, manipulation, all of the above.
[03:07:04.479 --> 03:07:11.180]  Really, if you read Brzezinski's book, he posits all of these as possibilities for the technocratic system when it rolls out.
[03:07:11.459 --> 03:07:19.360]  And we know that that was the plan that was chosen because it was really that book that caught the attention of David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger.
[03:07:19.500 --> 03:07:21.819]  So they were really impressed with Brzezinski's book.
[03:07:22.260 --> 03:07:23.659]  I've got it up here on my shelf.
[03:07:24.350 --> 03:07:29.750]  And when he wrote that, he was recruited into working for the establishment.
[03:07:29.909 --> 03:07:31.309]  There's really only one establishment.
[03:07:31.309 --> 03:07:34.450]  It's the people like this right here, this Rockefellers right there.
[03:07:35.149 --> 03:07:36.129]  That's who runs it.
[03:07:36.209 --> 03:07:46.110]  That's who set up the OSS and the CIA. That's who's aligned with the British Royal Society elites, the role in international affairs, Chatham House, etc.
[03:07:46.270 --> 03:07:47.350]  It's all the same establishment.
[03:07:47.510 --> 03:07:50.610]  All these different things are all part of the same octopus.
[03:07:51.620 --> 03:07:53.639]  They're all just tentacles on the same octopus.
[03:07:54.500 --> 03:08:10.200]  So don't get confused in all the entities, but just keep in mind that ultimately they're all the same people in all these entities, and these different frontispieces and foundations and think tanks and all that are really pushing the same thing, and that's essentially Skynet here.
[03:08:10.549 --> 03:08:15.489]  Now, I'm not saying all tech is bad or that all even implantable stuff is bad.
[03:08:15.729 --> 03:08:20.110]  I have family members that have Parkinson's that have benefited from these kinds of things.
[03:08:20.129 --> 03:08:22.129]  So it's not that the tech itself is bad.
[03:08:22.290 --> 03:08:28.170]  It's that the system wants to utilize these things for total tracking, tracing, and control.
[03:08:28.469 --> 03:08:40.149]  And I think everybody finally realized that the so-called conspiracy people were correct when we saw during COVID the push for vaccine passports, tracking, tracing, all of that.
[03:08:40.760 --> 03:08:46.299]  Especially the Gates Foundation and everything with ID that Gates was pushing.
[03:08:46.459 --> 03:08:47.719]  That's definitely what they wanted.
[03:08:48.040 --> 03:08:56.959]  And even to this day, you have people like Tony Blair still pushing a digital tracking and tracing control grid to make sure that you don't use too much carbon.
[03:08:57.159 --> 03:08:58.680]  That's essentially where it's going, right?
[03:08:58.860 --> 03:09:09.520]  It's not just about your health, so to speak, in terms of whether you contracted some fake made-up scam virus out of Wuhan or whatever.
[03:09:11.319 --> 03:09:20.139]  Whether or not you were actually, as a human being, a threat to society because of too much carbon output.
[03:09:20.920 --> 03:09:24.860]  And so really carbon tracking, tracing, all that, that's about controlling population.
[03:09:25.120 --> 03:09:28.379]  And controlling population doesn't just mean getting the population numbers down.
[03:09:28.399 --> 03:09:33.819]  That also means controlling you, tracking and tracing you on a day-to-day basis in everything that you do.
[03:09:34.629 --> 03:09:52.370]  And that's why he goes on to say the next part of this plan would be to end all industry and industrialization in the West, particularly cheap energy and cheap power, to eventually reach what the Club of Rome had deemed was the Zero Growth Society,
[03:09:52.770 --> 03:09:55.149]  sometimes called ZPG, Zero Population Growth.
[03:09:55.190 --> 03:09:56.450]  But it's not just about population.
[03:09:56.450 --> 03:09:59.049]  It's also zero economic growth.
[03:09:59.409 --> 03:10:14.850]  So what they want in the West, what they wanted for many, many years, was to de-industrialize the West and, through different government deals, send a lot of the industry purposefully overseas for China and other countries to be built up.
[03:10:15.049 --> 03:10:18.569]  And then they say, well, nobody in America wants to work, which is not true.
[03:10:18.610 --> 03:10:21.510]  This is actually a top-down agenda that was determined.
[03:10:22.370 --> 03:10:24.590]  And, I mean, this plan...
[03:10:37.419 --> 03:10:37.540]  We're good to go.
[03:10:55.809 --> 03:11:05.110]  It's not even so much about the cheap labor, but ultimately it's an issue of libertarian philosophy, which Silicon Valley purports to often believe.
[03:11:05.389 --> 03:11:08.010]  And in fact, I think in the early stages, a lot of people do believe in it.
[03:11:08.149 --> 03:11:13.049]  And then what happens is, and I'm not picking out anybody in particular, I think this happens across the board.
[03:11:13.229 --> 03:11:15.290]  Sometimes government comes in and buys out.
[03:11:15.549 --> 03:11:21.110]  Sometimes there's contracts between private entities and government, which allows certain companies to get an edge.
[03:11:22.760 --> 03:11:30.340]  We saw this especially with some of the big Silicon Valley companies that got seed funding from DARPA and the CIA, Facebook and others.
[03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:43.799]  And so what happens then is you get this sort of monopoly and oligopoly with these entities that can then have an immense amount of power to then try to say that they're going to fix society or whatever.
[03:11:43.940 --> 03:11:59.889]  But what happens is that There's a clash of duties or obligations because on the one hand, the corporation has obligations to the shareholders and they have obligations to save money, perhaps billions of dollars with labor.
[03:12:00.149 --> 03:12:11.270]  But at the same time, the population, the workers, the existing demographic group, they might have other allegiances that are not ultimately to shareholders or to a bottom line.
[03:12:11.409 --> 03:12:29.719]  So now we have a conflict between I'm not trying to just say kings were good, but one reason there were tariffs was because it was a protection for workers within that country.
[03:12:30.180 --> 03:12:38.819]  That meant that you couldn't just bring in foreign workers that would do the same work for pennies on the dollar and then send that money back home.
[03:12:39.700 --> 03:12:42.940]  There was a protection there through the tariff.
[03:12:43.520 --> 03:12:48.440]  And I don't know to what degree that does or doesn't exist in America anymore.
[03:12:48.659 --> 03:12:52.420]  I mean, Trump has made positive statements about bringing back tariffs.
[03:12:52.559 --> 03:12:53.379]  I think that's a good idea.
[03:12:53.979 --> 03:12:55.700]  That would definitely help the country.
[03:12:55.920 --> 03:13:12.620]  But there is a coordinated plan, is what I'm trying to say, that ultimately is all about de-industrializing the entire West, and especially the United States, because for the technocratic corporate socialist government to come about, America is really a big problem,
[03:13:12.780 --> 03:13:13.840]  and especially middle America.
[03:13:14.020 --> 03:13:23.200]  That's why the coastal cities hate middle America so much, is because they're part and parcel in this philosophy of creating a global socialist technocratic order.
[03:13:23.920 --> 03:13:28.819]  And unfortunately, as H.G. Wells said, sometimes libertarians can actually help participate in that.
[03:13:29.059 --> 03:13:46.440]  Because it's libertarian companies, supposedly Silicon Valley had this sort of libertarian ethos for so long, that really builds the infrastructure that then can be turned over to a socialist control, even though they have built a company for so long on the basis of liberty and freedom.
[03:13:47.010 --> 03:13:50.110]  But then it becomes Facebook, classic example, right?
[03:13:50.670 --> 03:13:52.709]  Silicon Valley is free market, supposedly.
[03:13:53.090 --> 03:13:56.709]  All the developers, investors, and all this pile in.
[03:13:56.809 --> 03:14:11.770]  And then you, as humans, contribute all the energy and all the information to essentially make Facebook as a test case into a giant entity that is basically spying on everyone's data collection and all that, which has all now been admitted.
[03:14:12.340 --> 03:14:18.680]  But it should have been evident from the beginning because, of course, it was funded by CIA money and QTEL money from the very get-go.
[03:14:18.979 --> 03:14:35.840]  But you can see that that was an example where even under the auspices of free market and all the people coming to it to be freely expressing their ideas, over time, it clamped down and shut down everybody's speech and was stealing everyone's data and was colluding with government.
[03:14:36.739 --> 03:14:40.979]  And then Zuckerberg apologizes, oh, my bad, sorry, I like Trump now, right?
[03:14:41.219 --> 03:14:53.459]  So that's a great example of what I'm talking about, where the libertarian phase was used to sort of dupe everyone, get them there, and then it flips over into a technocratic control.
[03:14:53.659 --> 03:15:04.360]  So we always have to be leery of this and this possibility, and so many tech companies have done this exact same plan and model to where it appears libertarian and free, and then it switches.
[03:15:07.629 --> 03:15:22.069]  Is something that won't actually work, though, if you export this to places where the labor is subpar or importation of entities and people that are subpar.
[03:15:22.290 --> 03:15:25.829]  This will actually destroy the existing company.
[03:15:25.989 --> 03:15:31.530]  So it doesn't seem very feasible to me other than through enforced DEI measures, which I totally disagree with.
[03:15:31.750 --> 03:15:33.829]  It doesn't make sense to actually do this.
[03:15:34.030 --> 03:15:38.190]  Why would you enforce these policies which actually Hurt the companies.
[03:15:38.409 --> 03:15:39.649]  And I don't just mean woke.
[03:15:39.829 --> 03:15:50.750]  I mean like hiring policies like diversity, equity, inclusion, which would actually not be based on the merit of the individuals coming in, but actually be based on these sort of affirmative action quotas.
[03:15:50.930 --> 03:15:54.309]  These are actually going to damage companies and they're going to damage production.
[03:15:54.450 --> 03:15:55.309]  They're going to damage goods.
[03:15:55.469 --> 03:15:58.610]  They're going to decrease the quality of everything in the West.
[03:15:58.770 --> 03:16:00.010]  And here's what I'm saying.
[03:16:00.170 --> 03:16:01.270]  That's by design.
[03:16:01.270 --> 03:16:11.739]  It's not just about We're good to go.
[03:16:34.220 --> 03:16:37.020]  I think?
[03:16:47.299 --> 03:16:57.219]  You understand, no, it makes perfect sense if there's a long-term plan to destroy the West and to flip it over into a kind of socialist technocracy.
[03:16:57.559 --> 03:17:02.700]  And they can utilize, as H.G. Wells said, a kind of libertarianism to get there.
[03:17:02.879 --> 03:17:11.059]  In fact, H.G. Wells, in one of his books, I remember his open conspiracy or neural order, he says to his fellow Marxists, you Marxists are too short-sighted.
[03:17:11.420 --> 03:17:15.440]  You think that the problem and your enemy is the free market capitalists.
[03:17:15.600 --> 03:17:16.420]  They're not your enemy.
[03:17:16.540 --> 03:17:19.739]  They're the ones that are going to build the infrastructure that we will take over.
[03:17:20.219 --> 03:17:27.860]  And when we take it over, we will create a technocratic control grid that won't be based on these Enlightenment libertarian ideas.
[03:17:28.879 --> 03:17:41.829]  So Coleman goes on to say that after they get this in place, when they have sufficiently de-industrialized the West, We're good to go.
[03:17:44.460 --> 03:17:47.540]  Oh, but look, we've got a UBI, a basic income that's going to come.
[03:17:47.639 --> 03:17:49.260]  It's going to be your credits that roll out.
[03:17:49.799 --> 03:17:53.280]  That is essentially what's already been announced and proposed.
[03:17:53.399 --> 03:17:58.520]  They haven't actually done it, but you notice, I mean, Zuckerberg was talking about a UBI a few years ago.
[03:17:58.719 --> 03:18:05.399]  So the very things that John Coleman wrote in 1992, this was way before Silicon Valley was even close to what it is today.
[03:18:05.600 --> 03:18:07.260]  I mean, it was big, but it wasn't like it is now.
[03:18:07.659 --> 03:18:15.409]  And he was telling you back then that they're going to try to roll out a technocratic Universal basic income, which is a form of socialism.
[03:18:16.770 --> 03:18:29.389]  And on top of that, the other ways that they would do this to de-industrialize would be to export all of the industry to countries where there's an available pool of slave labor.
[03:18:30.250 --> 03:18:34.250]  On top of that, he says and he mentions the Global 2000 Report of Kissinger.
[03:18:34.750 --> 03:18:41.870]  He talks about the legalization of all forms of vice and degeneracy to further demoralize the West.
[03:18:43.169 --> 03:18:58.350]  This demoralization is not accidental, it's by design, and it was part of the cultural warfare that entities like Tavistock had been studying since World War I, and even prior to that, with the lead-up to World War I through Wellington House.
[03:18:58.510 --> 03:19:08.329]  So they've mastered the techniques of propaganda, including culture war, and that's why they enlisted people like the Frankfurt School, who had engaged in culture war as well.
[03:19:08.590 --> 03:19:11.170]  This is the Alex Jones from your Guest Host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:19:11.430 --> 03:19:12.389]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:12.899 --> 03:19:20.479]  The globalist, black rock, new world order criminals want to make you poor and they want to make you sick.
[03:19:20.639 --> 03:19:21.959]  It's in their own admissions.
[03:19:22.260 --> 03:19:29.719]  Well, in any real revolution against tyranny, it is critical that we be independent and that we have the power of free speech.
[03:19:29.979 --> 03:19:35.579]  I'm bringing you the ultimate win-win or 360 win or non-zero-sum game.
[03:19:35.780 --> 03:19:41.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the AlexJonesStore.com affiliate program.
[03:19:41.940 --> 03:19:45.120]  It's so easy, even I know how to do it, and I'm not a big tech person.
[03:19:45.579 --> 03:19:46.219]  It's free.
[03:19:46.399 --> 03:19:52.200]  You go to the AlexJonesStore.com, you go sign up for free, you're giving your own affiliate link.
[03:19:53.030 --> 03:19:55.409]  And then each month you can cash it out.
[03:19:56.069 --> 03:20:06.190]  10% of every sale of game-changing supplements and amazing Patriot apparel and other great products that people love will go to you each month.
[03:20:06.430 --> 03:20:14.129]  So this is a way to help folks out getting great products to keep the show on the air and expanding in the face of the New World Order and to put money in your pocket.
[03:20:14.329 --> 03:20:15.649]  The globalists want you poor.
[03:20:15.750 --> 03:20:16.569]  They want you unhealthy.
[03:20:16.809 --> 03:20:18.049]  They want us isolated.
[03:20:18.170 --> 03:20:21.329]  They don't want all this Patriot apparel out there so we realize how strong we are.
[03:20:21.489 --> 03:20:23.110]  And so we don't meet like-minded people.
[03:20:23.510 --> 03:20:25.790]  This thing is so exciting.
[03:20:25.950 --> 03:20:28.149]  I was sitting here before I started taping this announcement.
[03:20:28.149 --> 03:20:30.309]  I was thinking, how do I hype this enough?
[03:20:30.969 --> 03:20:35.950]  If people get excited about this, if folks take action with this information, it's incredible.
[03:20:36.560 --> 03:20:42.500]  And the folks who are doing it with, our great sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, have done this with other talk shows, and it's been extremely successful.
[03:20:42.959 --> 03:20:45.680]  And this is a chance for you to join the Info War.
[03:20:46.000 --> 03:20:48.059]  So many people say, hey, we want to help you.

[03:21:12.799 --> 03:21:14.319]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:21:14.399 --> 03:21:15.479]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:21:15.659 --> 03:21:20.280]  I remind you that I will be live in Florida January 19th if you want to come see my event.
[03:21:23.699 --> 03:21:28.180]  We're good to go.
[03:21:49.950 --> 03:22:04.430]  We were talking about these reports, these different discussions amongst the Kissinger era of the government, Kissinger working really as sort of the liaison of the Rockefellers to set up the plans for depopulation.
[03:22:04.750 --> 03:22:15.629]  And I wanted to mention, as I've been pointing out quite a bit the last week, the rollout of the UFO nonsense is really ramped up intensely.
[03:22:16.850 --> 03:22:34.309]  And I think that that plays into this perfectly, because although I don't think Dr. Coleman mentions UFOs, what he does mention quite a bit in the book is the creation of a new mythos, of a new ideology for the West to believe in.
[03:22:34.770 --> 03:22:47.290]  But that mythos and that ideology has to really be amenable to and really sort of push people into The idea of a technocratic control by a global government.
[03:22:47.530 --> 03:22:50.409]  And so if the religion doesn't do that, it's really useless.
[03:22:50.670 --> 03:23:04.229]  But if you look at the whole history of the alien mythos of Roswell, Area 51, you know, the Betty and Barney Hill case, George Adamski, Alan Dulles as the head of the CIA, really protecting Adamski and furthering that narrative.
[03:23:04.569 --> 03:23:25.979]  If you watch documentaries like Mirage Men, you'll see people like Richard Doty are interviewed, who as a counterintelligence operator discusses at length We're good to go.
[03:23:28.359 --> 03:23:38.819]  Mr. Bob Moore, I think is the next guy, to really push out all this nonsense about reverse-engineered alien technology and that the government was keeping this as a secret.
[03:23:39.040 --> 03:23:42.739]  Well, now the government has come out the last couple of years and said, okay, yes, we found...
[03:23:43.100 --> 03:23:50.200]  Hidden alien tech, and now Tom DeLonge from Blink-182 is going to tell you the truth, and we've got generals who've talked to him.
[03:23:50.299 --> 03:23:56.020]  Trust us, it's all cool, which is all obviously a bunch of psychological operation nonsense.
[03:23:56.079 --> 03:23:57.799]  It's obviously fraudulent.
[03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:15.989]  There's not any explicitly clear evidence of We're good to go.
[03:24:32.190 --> 03:24:33.809]  You don't have to dig very far at all.
[03:24:34.010 --> 03:24:39.649]  And even the famous cases are all debunked as hoax stories borrowed from science fiction of abductions.
[03:24:39.989 --> 03:24:41.069]  So why is this?
[03:24:41.129 --> 03:24:42.549]  Why is this such a powerful narrative?
[03:24:42.729 --> 03:24:54.350]  Well, as we pointed out last week in the 1960s Brookings report, they said that they would be able to destroy Western civilization's mythos if they were to announce alien life.
[03:24:54.940 --> 03:25:16.319]  And so, when Reagan says in the United Nations back in the 80s that he's often concerned about how an external space threat would unite all the nations together and that they could put aside their differences with the Cold War, he might have been actually telling us where they wanted them to go with this idea of a fake narrative of,
[03:25:16.420 --> 03:25:22.659]  it doesn't have to be an invasion, it can just be, you know, the announcement of alien life, as the Brookings Institute Report says.
[03:25:23.170 --> 03:25:35.059]  to shake everyone's belief in the incarnation of Christ or whatever to introduce a new kind of religion Maybe that's the true religion that, you know, the Pope, because the Pope has even talked about alien life.
[03:25:35.180 --> 03:25:39.659]  So maybe he'll come out and support this announcement and, oh, yes, we need to support our space brothers.
[03:25:39.879 --> 03:25:46.639]  And that's what all the religions were really pointing to when they were talking about the, you know, belief in God or the angels or whatever.
[03:25:46.819 --> 03:25:47.700]  They're really just aliens.
[03:25:47.899 --> 03:25:53.600]  This fits perfectly with the new religious ethos that Coleman talks about.
[03:25:53.739 --> 03:25:55.319]  They want to introduce aliens.
[03:25:55.720 --> 03:26:13.000]  And again, this is all stuff, I mean, the religious, I don't know if the religious stuff is in there, but the Global 2000 report that we read about, people like Cyrus Vance, people like Henry Kissinger, they were talking about how to upend the West To make it more amenable to where they want to go.
[03:26:38.079 --> 03:26:45.620]  And the European Steel and Coal Community Project, those all were the beginnings of the European Union.
[03:26:46.079 --> 03:26:48.799]  But it took a lot of psychological operations.
[03:26:49.040 --> 03:26:53.420]  It took re-education, literally re-education camps in Germany to re-educate the Germans.
[03:26:53.420 --> 03:26:55.459]  That's what the OSS and the CIA set up.
[03:26:55.620 --> 03:26:59.299]  So you always think, oh, the communists, the Soviets set up re-education camps.
[03:26:59.520 --> 03:27:01.260]  Well, the OSS did it too.
[03:27:01.379 --> 03:27:08.180]  The CIA set up re-education camps in Germany to get Germans to not be interested in engineering.
[03:27:08.970 --> 03:27:11.629]  Absolutely, because Germans are some of the best engineers on the planet.
[03:27:11.790 --> 03:27:12.569]  Why would they do that?
[03:27:12.709 --> 03:27:16.049]  Because they didn't want Germany rebuilding and rearming.
[03:27:16.229 --> 03:27:18.850]  They wanted Germany to be agrarian.
[03:27:19.389 --> 03:27:25.829]  And I guess now into, you know, weird sprockets, sex stuff.
[03:27:26.010 --> 03:27:27.590]  I don't know what Germans are supposed to be into.
[03:27:28.090 --> 03:27:32.709]  But that was all run by Uncle Sam, right, to essentially...
[03:27:33.440 --> 03:27:41.040]  Re-engineer and retool a German state into something whatever they have now, which is basically something Islamic.
[03:27:41.649 --> 03:27:51.250]  And you can look at Europe and how they did that with Europe over the last several decades as a test case, as an example of what they want to do to America as well.
[03:27:51.569 --> 03:27:54.590]  It's a little bit more difficult because America is vast.
[03:27:54.690 --> 03:27:55.530]  It's sort of spread out.
[03:27:55.649 --> 03:27:56.649]  It's a lot of different states.
[03:27:56.950 --> 03:27:59.489]  Really, America is a bunch of different countries.
[03:27:59.870 --> 03:28:05.709]  The South bears little to no resemblance to California or something like that.
[03:28:05.790 --> 03:28:07.030]  So they're vastly different.
[03:28:07.069 --> 03:28:18.420]  So it's a little more challenging to make all of America We're good to go.
[03:28:39.860 --> 03:28:47.360]  In the plans of the Club of Rome, they discussed the fact that there's at least 3 billion, what they call, useless eaters.
[03:28:47.659 --> 03:28:57.139]  And so the Global 2000 report under Carter via Kissinger had stated that there would have to be a massive reduction of the population of the United States.
[03:28:57.159 --> 03:28:58.979]  This is back in the 1970s.
[03:28:59.319 --> 03:29:00.540]  To around 100 million.
[03:29:00.739 --> 03:29:16.340]  That was their projected plan back in the days of Kissinger and Carter and Cyrus Vance was to get the US down to 100 million by the year 2050. So notice that they had planned out many, many decades in the Global 2000 documents and others around that time.
[03:29:17.010 --> 03:29:23.549]  There's also the 1990, what is it, 91, 92 Rio meetings that Bush and Maurice Strong were at.
[03:29:23.709 --> 03:29:30.709]  They were discussing the same types of things of transitioning the American economy over into a de-industrialized service economy.
[03:29:31.629 --> 03:29:33.030]  This is all by design.
[03:29:33.149 --> 03:29:41.250]  That's the key thing is that people think that this is all just happening organically, and they don't think about long-term 50, 75-year plans.
[03:29:41.430 --> 03:29:52.600]  But the Global 2000 report That was accepted and approved by Carter officially as U.S. doctrine under the Secretary of State of the State Department.
[03:29:52.840 --> 03:29:57.639]  This became a plan to actually change America.
[03:29:57.979 --> 03:30:04.299]  It's not, everyone knows about, oh, well, Kissinger did a State Department Memorandum 200, which was about the depopulating of the Third World.
[03:30:04.520 --> 03:30:06.079]  Yeah, they also talked about America.
[03:30:06.579 --> 03:30:22.409]  And so this is why right around the same time, actually a couple years prior to this, You had the adoption of all of America's Planned Parenthoods that adopted the Berylson memo, which was a Rockefeller population report on pushing the gay lifestyle, pushing all alternative forms of living,
[03:30:22.930 --> 03:30:25.649]  open marriages, open whatever.
[03:30:25.829 --> 03:30:27.430]  That was all pushed.
[03:30:27.930 --> 03:30:45.690]  In the Barrelson memo, admittedly, to help change America into a socialist country, it actually says that they would have more taxes, there would be more socialism if they were able to get more and more people to not have families and to live in these sort of alternative lifestyles.
[03:30:45.770 --> 03:30:52.489]  At the same time, the Stanford Research Institute was putting out papers on alternative lifestyles, pushing alternative living.
[03:30:53.030 --> 03:31:07.469]  People like Alvin Toffler even talked about how they would attach alternative sexual lifestyles to other alternative movements like anarchism, vegetarianism, nowadays veganism, communal living, intentional communities.
[03:31:07.889 --> 03:31:16.149]  All these kinds of experimental lifestyles were pushed and promoted after the 1960s countercultural revolution by design in the white papers.
[03:31:16.329 --> 03:31:17.729]  So it's not organic.
[03:31:17.889 --> 03:31:18.370]  It's not random.
[03:31:18.950 --> 03:31:22.649]  You've got boomers at the Esalen Institute saying that they want to have sex with angels.
[03:31:23.590 --> 03:31:24.209]  And aliens.
[03:31:24.469 --> 03:31:24.989]  Literally.
[03:31:25.250 --> 03:31:31.069]  In the 1970s, they wanted to figure out how in rituals to have sex with alien angels.
[03:31:31.329 --> 03:31:31.829]  I'm not joking.
[03:31:31.870 --> 03:31:33.590]  That's in the official history of the Esalen Institute.
[03:31:34.250 --> 03:31:38.329]  So this sounds crazy to you, but this is all in the documents.
[03:31:38.329 --> 03:31:40.850]  When you actually read these documents, that's their actual plan.
[03:31:40.969 --> 03:31:49.409]  So that's why they pushed so hard the legalization of all forms of crazy drugs, which will eventually happen.
[03:31:50.210 --> 03:31:53.229]  I mean, I think there's a positive use for certain drugs.
[03:31:53.229 --> 03:32:02.209]  I'm not trying to say that, you know, I'm not someone like Puritan teetotaler here, but the point is that it's released on the public as a form of social engineering and weaponry.
[03:32:02.389 --> 03:32:02.950]  It's a weapon.
[03:32:04.969 --> 03:32:10.530]  And the packing people into massive megacities was a big part of this.
[03:32:10.629 --> 03:32:21.500]  In fact, the Club of Rome had studied this intently, according to Dr. Coleman and Dr. That people were much more easy to control and manage if they were sort of packed into these mega cities.
[03:32:26.040 --> 03:32:30.639]  Suppression of all scientific development except for that which is deemed beneficial by the committee.
[03:32:30.879 --> 03:32:38.659]  So this means that there's actual real advances that are made in medicine and technology, but they're actually suppressed because they don't want that out for the public.
[03:32:38.799 --> 03:32:42.399]  They want that only for certain select members of the elite.
[03:32:43.200 --> 03:32:51.659]  And they intentionally want to give us subpar or even damaging dysgenics-based products and technologies.
[03:32:52.340 --> 03:33:08.440]  Next, they would cause limited wars In certain regions and through certain advanced countries to create starvation and disease in third world countries that would help meet the third world goals of reducing the population by 3 billion.
[03:33:08.579 --> 03:33:25.879]  Now this does fit into Kissinger's State Department Memorandum 200 and the Global 2000 report because If you think about COVID, you know, Alex often talks about how many vast numbers of people died in the third world as a result of the COVID measures because supply chains were interrupted.
[03:33:26.120 --> 03:33:32.340]  And so you had really necessary, you know, fertilizers and other things, grain that didn't reach the third world.
[03:33:32.340 --> 03:33:43.920]  And you even had people from the establishment During the COVID nonsense, writing that, well, this is actually good because it helped the planet shut down and it helped the planet depopulate because humans are hurting the planet.
[03:33:44.200 --> 03:33:47.639]  So this is literally vindicated during the whole COVID nonsense.
[03:33:48.659 --> 03:34:06.219]  Next, he says that there would need to be all forms of demoralization released in the United States to weaken the moral fiber of the nation and to demoralize American workers and the working class by Number one,
[03:34:06.360 --> 03:34:11.280]  mass unemployment, but at the same time, importing masses of foreign workers.
[03:34:11.879 --> 03:34:15.540]  This would be done at a top-down elite corporate level.
[03:34:16.270 --> 03:34:31.450]  And thus the jobs would dwindle in the West by design as the Club of Rome helped to push zero-growth policies in the West, while none of those policies or those strictures are mandated for the East, for Asia, for China,
[03:34:31.569 --> 03:34:32.389]  for Eurasia, or whatever.
[03:34:32.610 --> 03:34:38.590]  So there's an intentional allowing and pushing and promoting of the building up of rival countries.
[03:34:38.809 --> 03:34:41.670]  So no, China at this level is not an enemy.
[03:34:42.129 --> 03:34:45.129]  They worked hand-in-hand with the global elite to be built up.
[03:34:46.139 --> 03:34:48.479]  I think?
[03:35:08.290 --> 03:35:11.750]  Thus, they would eventually not be able to pair, bond, and create families.
[03:35:11.989 --> 03:35:21.889]  This was all part of the Tavistock Institute's plans, who prepared their studies and their research for the global elites and the oligarchs to push this in America.
[03:35:22.049 --> 03:35:26.850]  Tavistock, for example, directed Stanford Research to undertake the works of Willis Harmon.
[03:35:27.370 --> 03:35:30.729]  I've quoted and cited Willis Harmon many, many times on my channel.
[03:35:30.829 --> 03:35:38.239]  You can notice right here, Coleman is arguing that this book, The Aquarian Conspiracy, which is not an Not a conspiracy book.
[03:35:38.819 --> 03:35:47.579]  It's actually a book about how the entire Western world needs to be essentially inverted.
[03:35:47.840 --> 03:35:49.979]  That women need to be running everything.
[03:35:50.280 --> 03:35:51.299]  Women need to be CEOs.
[03:35:51.520 --> 03:35:56.739]  We've listened too long to masculine patriarchal systems.
[03:35:56.739 --> 03:36:01.680]  It's time to invert and reverse all systems so that women run everything literally.
[03:36:02.139 --> 03:36:05.620]  And we have more and more essentially socialism.
[03:36:07.890 --> 03:36:17.370]  He argues that book wasn't actually written by Marilyn Ferguson, but was in fact put out by Stanford Research and was largely written by Willis Harmon, AKA Changing Images of Man and so forth.
[03:36:19.270 --> 03:36:24.729]  To keep people everywhere from deciding their own destinies, there would be many, many managed crises.
[03:36:25.829 --> 03:36:37.409]  So entities would be set up to stack layers and layers of governmental control, which are ultimately controlled, not even by the government or the elected officials, but by the deep state.
[03:36:37.670 --> 03:36:43.329]  So you would have entities like FEMA being set up that would have regional control.
[03:36:44.090 --> 03:36:46.790]  And it's just more and more management of crises.
[03:36:47.809 --> 03:36:53.989]  And the crises may be real or they might just be capitalized upon, if they're fake or whatever.
[03:36:54.629 --> 03:36:59.549]  But the point is that you use the crises, never let a good crisis go away.
[03:36:59.790 --> 03:37:02.569]  As Rahm Emanuel says, you steer it into what your goal is.
[03:37:02.670 --> 03:37:05.229]  So if your goal is more taxation, use the crisis.
[03:37:05.409 --> 03:37:09.530]  Oh, our, you know, entity, our government...
[03:37:10.569 --> 03:37:12.250]  Control system is underfunded.
[03:37:12.590 --> 03:37:15.930]  9-11 wouldn't have happened if we'd had billions of dollars more funding.
[03:37:16.450 --> 03:37:21.629]  So you see the crises lead to more funding, more taxation, and more problems.
[03:37:23.409 --> 03:37:30.069]  And as I said with the alien stuff, the introduction of more and more cults and new religions.
[03:37:30.329 --> 03:37:36.610]  These cults and new religions are actually key means by which alternative lifestyles can be promoted.
[03:37:36.610 --> 03:37:41.629]  And it's not just weird, wacky stuff, you know, Scientology or that kind of stuff.
[03:37:41.809 --> 03:37:43.670]  It's also Hindu.
[03:37:43.690 --> 03:37:45.370]  It's also New Age.
[03:37:45.469 --> 03:37:47.030]  It's also foreign religion.
[03:37:47.760 --> 03:38:03.879]  Religious traditions, Islam, mass imported as well to the West, and also the recent heresy of dispensationalism, which is all based on a recent invention that the nation-state of Israel is actually the church,
[03:38:03.879 --> 03:38:11.729]  and that's actually where everybody's focus should be, and the rapture is coming, and the antichrist is coming, all of which is a bunch of Nonsense in terms of historic Christianity.
[03:38:12.049 --> 03:38:15.729]  None of that was true in any Christian group 200 years ago.
[03:38:15.889 --> 03:38:21.809]  But that was actually a recently created idea for geopolitical ends as well as other things.
[03:38:22.969 --> 03:38:26.049]  He talks about liberation theology, Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:38:26.129 --> 03:38:30.110]  So you would basically have this importation into the West of all kinds of crazy ideas.
[03:38:30.329 --> 03:38:34.229]  Everything from, on the one hand, radical Islam, Salafi groups.
[03:38:34.229 --> 03:38:38.889]  As you know, I've debated all these top Muslims over the last five or six years.
[03:38:39.260 --> 03:38:40.559]  They're all public debates.
[03:38:40.819 --> 03:38:45.559]  I think the only one I haven't debated is Muhammad Hijab, and he says I'm not popular enough for him to debate.
[03:38:45.899 --> 03:38:55.739]  Now, that's an excuse, but the other ones that I've debated, you'll notice they're all basically Salafi, so they're all basically the most extreme branch of Islam.
[03:38:55.879 --> 03:38:59.680]  So why are the most vocal ones the ones that are the most extreme?
[03:38:59.860 --> 03:39:01.379]  Well, I think this is by design.
[03:39:01.379 --> 03:39:03.579]  I think there are entities that are pushing this in the West.
[03:39:04.129 --> 03:39:16.709]  Even the Tates have adopted Islam, or at least Andrew has adopted Islam, and pushed it heavily in the West because, I don't know why, maybe because he met with Saudis.
[03:39:16.790 --> 03:39:17.110]  Who knows?
[03:39:17.229 --> 03:39:29.090]  But he's pushed that because it's part of an overall agenda to push foreign religious commitments onto the West because they think that they've gained an upper hand in terms of the weakness of Christianity.
[03:39:29.250 --> 03:39:30.530]  And absolutely, Christianity is weak.
[03:39:31.090 --> 03:39:36.889]  I don't think most forms of Christianity could even be called Christianity.
[03:39:36.889 --> 03:39:41.909]  They're so bad with trans bishops, Episcopal, Methodists.
[03:39:42.010 --> 03:39:44.049]  All that stuff is just gone.
[03:39:44.610 --> 03:39:55.489]  So the people who at least believe in trying to adhere to Christian teaching, they're also still weakened by a bunch of weird heresies like the rapture and all kinds of nonsense like that.
[03:39:56.329 --> 03:39:56.930]  Dispensationalism.
[03:39:57.700 --> 03:40:12.139]  So that's put the West in an extremely terrible situation with the system, the government, and the corporate elite actually pushing and promoting all forms of weird, fringe, foreign religious groups, cults, and movements.
[03:40:13.899 --> 03:40:28.049]  And then Dr. Coleman goes on to say that you'll expect more and more of this because religious liberation and liberation theology is really a covert form of socialism, but it's not Marxists and KGB people in Moscow pushing it.
[03:40:28.170 --> 03:40:30.690]  It's actually pushed by Western elites, you see.
[03:40:30.989 --> 03:40:34.870]  In fact, the Rockefellers put out a report many, many years ago.
[03:40:35.110 --> 03:40:37.750]  You can still find this on academia.edu.
[03:40:38.389 --> 03:40:53.750]  Where they said that you might think that they would be against liberation theology back in the 70s and 80s, but actually Nelson Rockefeller said he supported it because liberation theology allowed Christians to finally accept birth control,
[03:40:54.010 --> 03:40:55.489]  abortion, and population control.
[03:40:55.670 --> 03:41:00.930]  So there's absolutely nothing that the Rockefeller Foundation saw as problematic with liberation theology.
[03:41:01.049 --> 03:41:02.069]  In fact, they loved it.
[03:41:03.030 --> 03:41:09.700]  Coleman says that expect in the next coming decades Massive amounts of terror, global terror.
[03:41:09.920 --> 03:41:23.040]  So here we are in 1992. He wrote this a year before the World Trade Center attack that was fostered by a false flag event with Ahmad Salam, who recorded being trapped into that event.
[03:41:23.340 --> 03:41:26.219]  That was, I think, supposed to be what 9-11 would end up being.
[03:41:27.309 --> 03:41:42.549]  So in 1992, he was warning about 1993 and 2001, and that we would see an outbreak of the global war on terror, which was intended intentionally to push the narrative of Islam versus the Christian West, which, of course,
[03:41:42.629 --> 03:41:59.809]  the Christian West here really bared no resemblance to the medieval Christianity, of Orthodox Christianity and the Roman Catholic world, you know, going to war against the We're good to go.
[03:42:21.219 --> 03:42:34.479]  The clashing together of all these things, whether it's capitalism versus communism or Islam versus Christianity, from the global elite perspective, they see no problem in this because this produces the necessary synthesis.
[03:42:34.799 --> 03:42:37.340]  They actually believe that this is necessary.
[03:42:40.960 --> 03:42:54.620]  We're good to go.
[03:43:07.730 --> 03:43:12.569]  We're good to go.
[03:43:32.569 --> 03:43:34.370]  Al-Qaeda and so forth.
[03:43:35.430 --> 03:43:38.270]  ISIS, you know, all these things.
[03:43:38.629 --> 03:43:42.110]  That was modeled on the structures of Gladio.
[03:43:42.329 --> 03:43:54.270]  All the terror cell networks that happened through Gladio literally just transferred into the same people training the Mujahideen to become Al-Qaeda and to become the so-called terror networks throughout the world.
[03:43:54.430 --> 03:44:01.690]  So the CIA, later on, Mossad as well, were involved in helping to train a lot of these groups, CIA especially, and Gladio.
[03:44:08.360 --> 03:44:10.840]  I'm not saying under the banner falsely.
[03:44:10.920 --> 03:44:12.219]  They really are Muslims.
[03:44:12.520 --> 03:44:17.020]  They really do have a lot of these Salafi beliefs and so forth.
[03:44:17.139 --> 03:44:19.139]  So that's by design.
[03:44:19.139 --> 03:44:23.500]  And the ultimate goal, he says, is to establish this movement.
[03:44:25.310 --> 03:44:36.170]  Synthesis where, because of terror, because of the threat that terror poses, you would have this total tracking and tracing and control as a result, and certainly that's what 9-11 produced.
[03:44:36.979 --> 03:44:55.079]  Yeah, I think.
[03:44:57.250 --> 03:45:03.170]  Lastly, he says to take control of education in America with the intent of completely destroying it and turning it into a socialist enterprise.
[03:45:03.629 --> 03:45:05.329]  So that's his Committee of 300 book.
[03:45:05.389 --> 03:45:09.950]  And he also has a great book called A One World Order Under a Socialist Dictatorship.
[03:45:10.469 --> 03:45:12.430]  And I recommend those if you haven't read them.
[03:45:12.530 --> 03:45:14.510]  They're good reads as well as his Tavistock book.
[03:45:14.629 --> 03:45:17.969]  And you can get my books over at jasonalsis.com if you're interested in it.
[03:45:26.170 --> 03:45:28.969]  It's time to take action.
[03:45:29.309 --> 03:45:35.170]  So for a lot of you out there, this is free and you can make supplemental money very easily.
[03:45:35.530 --> 03:45:38.649]  I mean, I would imagine most people can make hundreds of bucks a month with their eyes closed.
[03:45:38.979 --> 03:45:44.520]  And if you really kick ass, thousands of dollars, even if you have a tiny, you know, X account or Facebook or whatever.
[03:45:44.840 --> 03:45:53.239]  But if you're a talk show host, I mean, you can make a living and finance your show and maybe even, you know, hire reporters or whatever.
[03:45:53.360 --> 03:45:54.659]  I mean, this is exciting.
[03:45:54.860 --> 03:45:57.940]  So, go now to thelshostore.com.
[03:45:58.079 --> 03:45:59.020]  And one other thing.
[03:45:59.280 --> 03:46:02.059]  There are five limited edition fundraiser posters.
[03:46:02.219 --> 03:46:03.979]  And by fundraiser, everything raises funds there.
[03:46:04.079 --> 03:46:07.680]  But the t-shirts cost like 16, 17 bucks a piece before you buy them.
[03:46:07.819 --> 03:46:10.379]  And then the sponsor gets half or we get half.
[03:46:10.520 --> 03:46:14.819]  And to run all this and build a new network as a backup, you know, we're squeaking by.
[03:46:15.020 --> 03:46:21.840]  But when something says fundraiser on it, like a t-shirt that's cost double or a poster, yeah, the poster costs five, six bucks.
[03:46:22.280 --> 03:46:25.620]  I mean, the shipping, we ship it in the special packaging costs as much as the poster itself.
[03:46:26.190 --> 03:46:29.889]  So we're, you know, six, seven, eight, nine bucks for the poster cost with the packaging.
[03:46:30.049 --> 03:46:32.069]  And then we're selling it for 25, 30 bucks.
[03:46:32.190 --> 03:46:34.010]  That's because there's some real markup in there to fund it.
[03:46:34.069 --> 03:46:35.389]  So you know you're buying something.
[03:46:35.629 --> 03:46:37.750]  There's a memento that you really backed what we're doing.
[03:46:38.309 --> 03:46:41.569]  The campaign coins, challenge coins, they're all there.
[03:46:42.809 --> 03:46:46.030]  So the posters run from $19.95 to $29.95.
[03:46:46.489 --> 03:46:49.090]  And we'll have new limited edition posters after that.
[03:46:49.590 --> 03:46:54.909]  But the posters on January 6th will be no more.
[03:46:55.809 --> 03:47:00.530]  They're limited edition, so if you get your order in by then, you will get the poster because they're print on demand.
[03:47:00.530 --> 03:47:01.190]  They're in Arkansas.
[03:47:01.750 --> 03:47:03.969]  If you want one of these posters, there they are.
[03:47:04.450 --> 03:47:08.389]  And again, you've got until January 6th to get your order in.
[03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:09.729]  They look great hanging on the wall.
[03:47:09.770 --> 03:47:11.469]  We got them hanging here in Arkansas.
[03:47:11.500 --> 03:47:12.020]  The office.
[03:47:12.260 --> 03:47:14.420]  And I designed all of these.
[03:47:14.579 --> 03:47:19.860]  My favorite is the Trump graph that I showed the day before the election that predicted the election.
[03:47:20.020 --> 03:47:22.059]  I said, she's going to try to steal it, but it's going to fail.
[03:47:22.280 --> 03:47:27.299]  So the blue line goes up, it goes straight up, but it's not enough fraud to overpower the landslide.
[03:47:27.440 --> 03:47:29.459]  And that's actually the graph that actually happened.
[03:47:29.840 --> 03:47:30.920]  The Key Battlegrounds.
[03:47:31.120 --> 03:47:32.860]  So you talk about nailing it, baby.
[03:47:33.180 --> 03:47:34.079]  That's my favorite.
[03:47:34.200 --> 03:47:35.000]  I designed that one.
[03:47:35.239 --> 03:47:37.299]  And then the 47th one I designed as well.
[03:47:37.440 --> 03:47:38.540]  So I designed those.
[03:47:39.229 --> 03:47:41.510]  I did not design the Darkest Hour one, but there it is.
[03:47:41.610 --> 03:47:42.290]  Thank you for the support.
[03:47:42.389 --> 03:47:42.989]  I'm done plugging.
[03:47:43.409 --> 03:47:53.709]  I've just been looking at all the attacks and our victories in court, and I realized how much money it takes to take these people on, and they are so pissed we're still on air, and I have hired high-powered lawyers.
[03:47:53.850 --> 03:47:54.530]  That's why we're winning.
[03:48:00.440 --> 03:48:04.979]  My lawyers are working seven days a week.
[03:48:05.540 --> 03:48:07.159]  Because I go and meet with them almost every day.
[03:48:07.319 --> 03:48:09.200]  I mean, they call me at midnight and say, come to the office.
[03:48:09.219 --> 03:48:10.959]  I want you to read this and sign it, make sure it's accurate.
[03:48:11.100 --> 03:48:11.500]  I mean, we are.
[03:48:12.420 --> 03:48:19.739]  If I told you all the suits we filed on and all the crap we're doing to bloom, you know, to the whole deep state, because I can't be on defense anymore.
[03:48:19.780 --> 03:48:20.500]  I got to go on offense.
[03:48:21.139 --> 03:48:22.579]  It would take an hour to go over it all.
[03:48:23.620 --> 03:48:24.899]  But you want me to fight?
[03:48:25.059 --> 03:48:25.520]  I'm fighting.
[03:48:26.299 --> 03:48:26.620]  So...
[03:48:28.129 --> 03:48:29.590]  You're financing the current operation.
[03:48:29.750 --> 03:48:32.049]  You're financing the Backup Palace Jokes Network if we get shut down.
[03:48:32.270 --> 03:48:34.329]  And that's still getting built and expanded.
[03:48:34.469 --> 03:48:35.590]  Not, you know, a larger studio.
[03:48:35.909 --> 03:48:36.590]  Almost done.
[03:48:37.510 --> 03:48:39.690]  And you're financing the legal defense and offense.
[03:48:39.930 --> 03:48:40.889]  I mean, this is a war.
[03:48:40.969 --> 03:48:42.049]  You want somebody to fight for you?
[03:48:42.250 --> 03:48:43.450]  I love it.
[03:48:44.200 --> 03:48:46.819]  I mean, I'm begging for you to keep me in the game and keep me in the fight, Coach.
[03:48:47.000 --> 03:48:48.479]  But I'm here, your servant.
[03:48:48.780 --> 03:48:49.799]  You commissioned me.
[03:48:50.819 --> 03:48:56.739]  Look, I won't stop regardless of what happens, but I'm asking you to empower me, and I will give you everything I got.
[03:48:57.120 --> 03:49:03.440]  I'm so focused right now and so sick of this crap and the stuff I've been doing to my family behind the scenes, just absolutely criminal.
[03:49:04.059 --> 03:49:06.780]  And so all I'm asking for is the support to keep fighting.
[03:49:07.219 --> 03:49:08.719]  And we make it easy with incredible products.
[03:49:08.799 --> 03:49:09.500]  Okay, I'm done.
