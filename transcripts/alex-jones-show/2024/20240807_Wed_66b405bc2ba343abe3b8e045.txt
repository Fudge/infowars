[00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.112]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:32.412 --> 00:00:32.892]  Today.
[00:00:38.394 --> 00:00:45.196]  What could be weirder than signing a bill into law that requires schools to stock tampons in boys' bathrooms?
[00:00:45.917 --> 00:00:51.479]  Or weirder than signing legislation allowing minors to receive sex change operations?
[00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.241]  Try electing the man who signed those bills, Vice President of the United States.
[00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:00.742]  Enter Chief Weirdo Tim Walz.
[00:01:01.363 --> 00:01:11.568]  As Governor of Minnesota, Walz supported legislation that endangers minors, hurts women, and puts radical ideology ahead of common sense.
[00:01:12.188 --> 00:01:16.670]  Now Kamala wants Walz to enforce those laws on a national scale.
[00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.511]  Tim Walz.
[00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:19.611]  Too weird.
[00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:20.752]  Too radical.
[00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:30.024]  That's the Republicans countering this talking point we've seen the last few weeks of Trump's weird.
[00:01:31.505 --> 00:01:32.506]  Teddy Vance is weird.
[00:01:34.888 --> 00:01:37.851]  When they are not just weirdos, the Democrats, they are evil.
[00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:39.613]  They're a sick cult.
[00:01:40.493 --> 00:01:44.797]  Now look, I know who Tim Walz was and followed him back when he had the police stand down.
[00:01:45.692 --> 00:01:48.934]  Let BLM and the communists and the rest of them burn down half the state.
[00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:56.500]  And I knew he pushed really radical, aggressive sterilization and castration of boys and sterilization of girls.
[00:01:57.761 --> 00:02:04.306]  But since he was the official pick yesterday, I did the deep dive on him.
[00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:06.968]  This guy is a creepazoid.
[00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:09.990]  And let me just say this.
[00:02:11.946 --> 00:02:17.249]  If anybody could legally lawfully take a look on his computers, I think you'd find some very interesting stuff.
[00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.970]  He just has that whole look to him.
[00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:30.074]  And he wants to, he does, he wants to target and brainwash children and take them away from their parents and sterilize them.
[00:02:30.094 --> 00:02:32.816]  I mean, that's worse than physically raping them, in my view.
[00:02:33.316 --> 00:02:36.637]  If they can recover from that, you can't really recover from having your genitals actually cut off.
[00:02:37.598 --> 00:02:39.839]  So this guy is, you know, beyond
[00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:47.934]  Tampon Tim, as he's now known for by law putting tampons in the boys bathrooms.
[00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:51.918]  The guy is Hellraiser Tim.
[00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.700]  He wants to chop body parts off children.
[00:02:55.682 --> 00:03:01.168]  But then we've got his kook wife saying she loved the smell of burning buildings and burning tires and opened the windows up so she could smell it.
[00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:05.062]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[00:03:05.883 --> 00:03:11.847]  Trump's come out and says Biden will try to take back the nomination at the DNC after it was stolen by Kamala.
[00:03:11.927 --> 00:03:14.869]  I hear there's a big movement to bring back Crooked Joe.
[00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.270]  Trump has a lot of credibility.
[00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.171]  He has a lot of sources.
[00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:20.492]  Roger Stone's popping back in today.
[00:03:20.512 --> 00:03:21.353]  I'll ask him about that.
[00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:23.634]  I wouldn't count that out as crazy as it sounds.
[00:03:23.654 --> 00:03:24.515]  I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[00:03:24.535 --> 00:03:27.557]  In fact, I don't believe it will, but they may certainly try.
[00:03:28.905 --> 00:03:36.567]  Because, you know, the left are controlled by BlackRock and the big banks completely, and they're at war with the people, but they're also always fighting with each other over power continually.
[00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:39.127]  Harris-Waltz is that bad?
[00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:43.388]  CNBC host tells viewers, if you care about your paycheck, you go with Trump, which is true.
[00:03:43.408 --> 00:03:51.290]  And his co-host blamed the wrecked blue cities on Trump, and that Trump wants to, quote, destroy us.
[00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.990]  What?
[00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:54.991]  Unbelievable.
[00:03:57.256 --> 00:04:07.339]  Trump did really something big where he did not discriminate with federal stimulus money and economic zones, like Democrats do, just giving it to Democrat areas.
[00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.319]  He was very, very even-handed about it.
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.540]  The blue cities would be even more collapsed if Trump wasn't there for four years.
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.980]  We know that.
[00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:19.602]  Scott Jennings levels other CNN hosts by saying, Tim Walz is normal.
[00:04:20.162 --> 00:04:23.443]  Is it normal to let the biggest cities in your state burn for four days?
[00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:26.219]  We're good.
[00:04:47.168 --> 00:04:48.569]  I mean, I'm just getting started here.
[00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:49.830]  This guy is a total lunatic communist.
[00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.451]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:51.832]  All right, it is now official.
[00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:17.576]  The UN says they are set to declare monkeypox and bird flu a global emergency.
[00:05:18.478 --> 00:05:21.462]  And from New York City to Los Angeles, California.
[00:05:23.117 --> 00:05:27.520]  They're putting up billboards and running TV ads saying time to wear the mask again, time to take all your shots.
[00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:40.568]  The Biden-controlled FDA that's literally run by Big Pharma has gotten emergency authorization for the bird flu mRNA poison that does absolutely nothing to protect you, obviously.
[00:05:41.489 --> 00:05:42.570]  It's total insanity.
[00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:43.830]  So it's official.
[00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:50.495]  With just 90 days left, the most important election in world history, or technically 89 days, we'll put it on screen.
[00:05:51.297 --> 00:05:55.338]  They are going to try to roll out a global freak-out pandemic yet again.
[00:05:57.299 --> 00:06:06.241]  WHO chief poised to declare international health emergency as monkeypox spreads in Africa.
[00:06:07.261 --> 00:06:13.083]  And they've got all the usual suspects, the different UN spokespersons saying, COVID is back and it's super bad.
[00:06:15.624 --> 00:06:17.584]  Monkeypox is here, it's totally horrible.
[00:06:17.644 --> 00:06:19.545]  Bird flu is here, just run for the hills.
[00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:29.591]  Meanwhile, Pharma and WHO publicly team up to create permanent pandemic market, that's a quote, for mandated experimental vaccines, which aren't even vaccines.
[00:06:29.611 --> 00:06:30.512]  They've changed definition.
[00:06:31.392 --> 00:06:34.393]  So I'm going to be getting to that, and I'm glad it's finally getting some traction.
[00:06:34.433 --> 00:06:36.733]  I covered this Saturday and Sunday.
[00:06:36.773 --> 00:06:37.814]  I thought it was a big deal.
[00:06:39.194 --> 00:06:42.935]  And sure, the video's got a few million views, but they should have gotten a hundred million.
[00:06:44.856 --> 00:06:49.717]  Peter Hotez is officially a WHO CDC mouthpiece.
[00:06:51.442 --> 00:06:56.572]  And he came out and said, we need UN troops and NATO in America during the next lockdown.
[00:06:57.153 --> 00:06:58.796]  Now, we've always told you that's coming.
[00:06:58.816 --> 00:06:59.858]  That's what the UN treaty is about.
[00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.563]  It's what all the COVID camps are about all over the world.
[00:07:04.236 --> 00:07:08.778]  And we have the head of global crises response, Dr. Ryan at the U.N.
[00:07:08.878 --> 00:07:13.080]  saying the same thing years ago, but they're really serious about this.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.623]  It's not Alex Jones 30 years ago saying they've got plans to put U.N.
[00:07:17.643 --> 00:07:19.944]  troops in America, and people didn't think that would ever happen.
[00:07:20.304 --> 00:07:32.470]  I was going over the State Department documents from 1962, State Department memorandum, and several other documents.
[00:07:34.677 --> 00:07:36.519]  And I'll pull those back up for you today.
[00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:47.308]  But since the early 60s, the different foundations and the federal government and the CIA have really been promoting State Department memorandum 7277 and others.
[00:07:47.368 --> 00:07:58.397]  And Kissinger put out more memorandums in the early 70s saying similar things that they would use global pandemics to bring in the one world government and put UN troops in America.
[00:07:59.844 --> 00:08:08.826]  It's one thing to read it in a document, but when you see the different spokespersons of the UN running around saying it, it means they're really going to try it.
[00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:10.706]  And here's the deal.
[00:08:11.006 --> 00:08:12.187]  Yes, COVID was man-made.
[00:08:12.267 --> 00:08:13.287]  Yes, it spread quickly.
[00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:14.907]  Yes, it was novel.
[00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:17.128]  Yes, they would block normal treatment for it so you had some death.
[00:08:18.668 --> 00:08:22.949]  But they made it novel so that when virologists looked at it under an electron microscope,
[00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:28.600]  They would see a manufactured virus and it had five viruses put together.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.101]  We knew that back in February of 2020.
[00:08:32.162 --> 00:08:35.383]  And of course it all came out to be documented and accurate.
[00:08:36.804 --> 00:08:39.165]  That was meant to scare people because it was so obviously man-made.
[00:08:39.806 --> 00:08:41.286]  But then it was the shots that were...
[00:08:42.463 --> 00:08:47.986]  Enumerably worse than the actual so-called pathogen that's supposedly causing the disease.
[00:08:48.867 --> 00:09:02.434]  Now because of all the injections they gave people while they were sick, any virologist will tell you up until modern, the last few years, that causes insane mutations in the regular viruses and gives rise to all these new horrible viruses.
[00:09:03.455 --> 00:09:07.197]  And so there is all sorts of weird illness going on, all sorts of weird death going on,
[00:09:08.066 --> 00:09:12.130]  You have record levels of really bad colds and flus this summer.
[00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.713]  I know a lot of people have been very, very sick.
[00:09:16.434 --> 00:09:18.857]  Especially those that aren't taking the right supplements and things.
[00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:22.200]  And so there's a lot of weirdness going on.
[00:09:23.281 --> 00:09:25.323]  And they could very easily, at any time,
[00:09:26.334 --> 00:09:27.074]  We're good to go.
[00:09:49.614 --> 00:09:51.376]  Building it up right to the election.
[00:09:51.756 --> 00:10:08.030]  Now again, in normal times, it takes decades, if not hundreds of years, for a zoological virus that stays in dogs, or cats, or pigs, or cows, or bats, or armadillos, or anything else, or rats, to jump into humans.
[00:10:08.351 --> 00:10:09.231]  And it's very rare.
[00:10:10.192 --> 00:10:11.814]  Sometimes it's able to replicate, it can spread.
[00:10:12.734 --> 00:10:15.377]  But in laboratories, they're able to get this done very quickly.
[00:10:16.815 --> 00:10:27.125]  So for them to say six months ago, oh we need to think of the next six months, it's going to mutate and jump into humans, that's them saying they've got nastier versions they're getting ready to release.
[00:10:27.165 --> 00:10:39.157]  So just because they hit us with something that was novel but wasn't that powerful and mainly killed old people, which is still terrible, don't think they won't want something really nasty off the shelf.
[00:10:40.782 --> 00:10:42.682]  And Russian intelligence has gotten a lot of documents.
[00:10:43.262 --> 00:10:44.463]  I don't just believe Russian intelligence.
[00:10:44.483 --> 00:10:49.844]  I remember Obama, he was a senator going to Ukraine, setting up the bioweapon labs, and then when he was president.
[00:10:50.524 --> 00:10:52.524]  So Ukraine's one of the main places, not just China.
[00:10:53.624 --> 00:11:10.007]  And the Russians got documents, and I went and checked, a lot of these are already partially public, large sections of them are, and the documents the Russians got two years ago and last year, and then again a few months ago, their head of chemical biological weapons program came out and said, we believe the West is preparing a false flag, probably be blamed on Russia,
[00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:16.235]  And destabilize the rest of the world, and we believe they're getting ready to release a man-made virus.
[00:11:16.295 --> 00:11:20.738]  Well, you see all the pre-programming in the media, it does point towards that.
[00:11:20.818 --> 00:11:31.764]  So, coming up later in the hour, I'm going to go over all this in detail, play the Hotez Clubs, play Naomi Wolf, responding to it.
[00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:36.106]  Naomi Wolf, she's been coming on the show 25 years, but she's really not like me.
[00:11:36.407 --> 00:11:38.348]  But she's a real liberal, so she'd debate me.
[00:11:39.181 --> 00:11:40.562]  And we agreed on some things, not on others.
[00:11:40.602 --> 00:11:41.923]  Now she says it's an honor to come on.
[00:11:42.123 --> 00:11:42.903]  We need her back on.
[00:11:43.424 --> 00:11:45.365]  And then I was basically right about everything, unfortunately.
[00:11:46.065 --> 00:11:50.368]  Imagine her thinking we're total kooks 30 years ago, saying they have a plan for U.N.
[00:11:50.408 --> 00:11:53.269]  troops in America, and now it's being announced all over the place.
[00:11:53.449 --> 00:11:57.052]  I mean, it's just astounding.
[00:11:57.112 --> 00:12:01.394]  So they've been planning this for 40, 50 years, but it's here now.
[00:12:02.495 --> 00:12:05.897]  And that doesn't mean they're going to pull the pandemic card, though it looks like they've
[00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:14.534]  You know, you get home at six o'clock from school, from football practice, and mama's in the kitchen, and it smells good, and you're not sure what it is.
[00:12:14.554 --> 00:12:23.419]  You haven't asked her yet or looked in the oven, but, you know, looks like, hey, it smells like mama's making pot roast, or, you know, mom's making chicken fried steak, whatever it is.
[00:12:23.479 --> 00:12:24.620]  You can smell the food.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.861]  Well, you can smell the tyranny and smell the death.
[00:12:27.382 --> 00:12:28.422]  They've got it heated up.
[00:12:28.482 --> 00:12:29.723]  They've got it ready to serve.
[00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:36.327]  They got it all pre-programmed, and it looks like they're going to go ahead and go with the new pandemic.
[00:12:37.369 --> 00:12:41.733]  Though people aren't buying into it, so they're having big problems getting proper hysteria going, but they're trying.
[00:12:43.014 --> 00:12:49.599]  Then you've got the open borders, the terror attack threat, the expanding wars, the civil unrest, the left admits they want to stir up a civil war.
[00:12:52.341 --> 00:13:05.712]  And again, it's not me reading federal documents, of course it is, where Joe Biden said three years ago the main terror threat will be white people and conservatives who are going to outlaw MAGA, and then all the surrogates on MSNBC and CNN saying the same thing.
[00:13:08.049 --> 00:13:16.672]  They're now officially coming out and saying we're going to have a civil war in America and Trump will not be put back in even if he's elected.
[00:13:18.033 --> 00:13:19.833]  It's not just Jamie Raskin saying that.
[00:13:20.413 --> 00:13:22.034]  It's one of the top minions of the system.
[00:13:22.114 --> 00:13:27.856]  It's a bunch of them and so we should have a discussion.
[00:13:27.876 --> 00:13:28.636]  Open the phones up.
[00:13:29.677 --> 00:13:32.558]  What do we do about the UN planning to put UN troops in America?
[00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:36.168]  And NATO, sorry, I forgot about that.
[00:13:36.669 --> 00:13:40.191]  What do we do about their open plans for worldwide martial law and force injections?
[00:13:41.852 --> 00:13:44.893]  Because I don't believe we should ever offensively go after any of these people.
[00:13:46.354 --> 00:14:02.564]  I was listening to Glenn Beck this morning driving into work and he was saying, look, he doesn't think God will be on our side if we offensively ever do something, and I agree with that, but at a certain point, what is offense, what is defense when you're being hit with bioweapons, the borders are wide open, your government is at war with you,
[00:14:04.736 --> 00:14:07.237]  And everything they do is to undermine the country and they're targeting our children.
[00:14:08.457 --> 00:14:21.800]  I'm not saying or even hinting, go out and be violent, because they would really play off of that and that's what they want, because we're winning hearts and minds so fast, they can see that no matter what they do, they're out of power very soon, not just here but around the world.
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.500]  So they want to get the confrontation going.
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:33.082]  All I'm saying is, they do a cyber outage, they release some deadly virus, they got stuff locked down, the food supplies break down, you got riots and burning crap in the streets,
[00:14:34.605 --> 00:14:36.026]  You better be ready to protect yourselves.
[00:14:36.627 --> 00:14:46.396]  And then to the people in the government and the bureaucrats that they are intending to send out to people's houses to drag them off to these emergency pandemic centers.
[00:14:47.097 --> 00:14:50.720]  Look, I don't have any bloodlust and I know my listeners don't either.
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:57.806]  We don't want to fight with you, but let me just advise the FBI and the local police and the federal marshals and the military and everybody.
[00:14:58.547 --> 00:14:59.848]  I don't think you even need me to tell you this.
[00:15:00.348 --> 00:15:09.412]  Do you think total collapse and martial law and war on the streets and trying to take people to emergency centers is a very healthy job for you?
[00:15:11.133 --> 00:15:12.614]  Or for the people you're trying to come grab?
[00:15:12.994 --> 00:15:16.576]  No, it is going to descend into all-out war.
[00:15:17.897 --> 00:15:18.957]  And I'm trying to stop that.
[00:15:20.118 --> 00:15:20.278]  But
[00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:36.598]  I can play you, Hotez, and play you, Raskin, and play you dozens of clips off the top of my mind just last week with them giggling and laughing about how they're going to create a civil war in America and have a fight with the MAGA people.
[00:15:37.018 --> 00:15:37.278]  What?
[00:15:40.801 --> 00:15:46.805]  And yeah, Raskin wants to sit back while federal, state, and local forces get whipped into hysteria
[00:15:48.431 --> 00:15:53.573]  It'll kick off probably first with, you know, civil unrest and racial division and then a virus.
[00:15:54.313 --> 00:15:55.834]  And so it'll be like, everybody do what you're told.
[00:15:56.134 --> 00:15:57.154]  We'll get the power back on.
[00:15:57.174 --> 00:15:57.935]  We'll get you the food.
[00:15:57.975 --> 00:15:58.775]  We'll get you the medicine.
[00:15:58.795 --> 00:16:02.977]  And then the globalists stage some false flags to demonize right-wingers.
[00:16:04.417 --> 00:16:06.978]  And then they order the FBI to go out and start grabbing everybody.
[00:16:07.158 --> 00:16:12.000]  And it won't be like January 6th, where we all knew we got set up and we were trying to stabilize the country.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.501]  If the feds push,
[00:16:16.428 --> 00:16:26.097]  Into this next move, I can tell you most of the rank-and-file Border Patrol and other federal agents are bare minimum not going to show up.
[00:16:26.957 --> 00:16:28.679]  And a lot of them are actually going to show up with the people.
[00:16:28.719 --> 00:16:29.500]  That's guaranteed.
[00:16:30.635 --> 00:16:38.203]  So I would really advise Obama and the globalists and Hillary and their controllers and Raskin, know when you're beaten, okay?
[00:16:39.104 --> 00:16:51.276]  And just let us politically take the country back peacefully and turn the energy back on and try to stabilize inflation and try to control the border, try to take care of the military, try to take care of seniors, and try to stabilize the dollar, and
[00:16:52.697 --> 00:16:54.158]  You'll pretty much be left alone.
[00:16:54.198 --> 00:16:56.018]  Trump isn't looking to come after all you people.
[00:16:56.539 --> 00:16:59.120]  Except that really is his duty, but knowing Trump, he won't.
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.341]  But I would tell you, get out of the way.
[00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.102]  Everything you touch turns to crap.
[00:17:04.042 --> 00:17:05.443]  Every move you make doesn't work.
[00:17:06.063 --> 00:17:08.084]  You couldn't even, you know, kill Trump properly.
[00:17:09.364 --> 00:17:19.489]  And I'm telling you, just anybody can look at this and understand that you've got a bunch of crazy lawyers, like Swallowswell,
[00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:26.317]  When he was arguing with folks online, Joe Biggs, about how we're going to confiscate your guns.
[00:17:26.898 --> 00:17:31.202]  Remember back during the Democrat primaries, five years ago, four years ago, four and a half years ago.
[00:17:31.843 --> 00:17:32.344]  They're all up there.
[00:17:32.364 --> 00:17:33.525]  Hell yeah, we'll take your AR-15.
[00:17:33.565 --> 00:17:35.007]  Hell yeah, we're going to confiscate them.
[00:17:36.604 --> 00:17:39.546]  And big cities try to confiscate them, and that's going to cause 1776.
[00:17:40.967 --> 00:17:47.632]  And Swallow's Well, the Chinese communist agent, said, well, listen, we've got nuclear weapons, so we'll beat you.
[00:17:48.152 --> 00:17:49.513]  And Biden has said a bunch.
[00:17:49.834 --> 00:17:51.895]  We've got F-15s and F-18s.
[00:17:52.575 --> 00:17:54.717]  You don't use F-18s to confiscate guns.
[00:17:54.737 --> 00:17:55.938]  You don't use nuclear weapons.
[00:17:56.839 --> 00:18:02.342]  Nuclear weapons are to take out large military forces or, in a full-out exchange, major cities and industry.
[00:18:02.883 --> 00:18:04.364]  The cities are Democrat-run.
[00:18:04.384 --> 00:18:05.465]  You're going to nuke yourselves?
[00:18:07.008 --> 00:18:11.310]  No, it takes boots on the ground to go out and kick in doors and take those guns.
[00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:17.432]  And then once that kicks off, people aren't waiting in their house with the guns for you to come to them.
[00:18:18.152 --> 00:18:21.554]  Once it kicks off, they're going to come to you like the French resistance on steroids.
[00:18:22.814 --> 00:18:24.695]  So I've looked at every angle of this.
[00:18:25.815 --> 00:18:26.435]  It's insane.
[00:18:26.956 --> 00:18:32.598]  And you've got Raskin and Hotez and Biden and
[00:18:34.013 --> 00:18:39.517]  Swallows well, all talking about F-18s and nuclear weapons and UN troops.
[00:18:39.718 --> 00:18:41.819]  I mean, let me give the Globals a new slash.
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:52.848]  It's one thing to have a UN global treaty and have the UN be in charge of the tyranny, but it'll still come as local law enforcement if they follow the illegal orders.
[00:18:54.069 --> 00:18:57.411]  But you are dumb enough to put blue helmets on the ground in America?
[00:18:59.133 --> 00:19:00.374]  America will turn on you
[00:19:02.261 --> 00:19:03.922]  Basically, 99% will turn on you.
[00:19:04.963 --> 00:19:11.927]  So, and again, they're talking about NATO troops with the UN in America.
[00:19:15.869 --> 00:19:18.191]  And that's what they're sitting around in their boardrooms talking about.
[00:19:18.231 --> 00:19:20.032]  These people are crazy.
[00:19:20.872 --> 00:19:27.637]  And again, the average senator, the average Democrat senator is raised in a high-rise apartment, three generations, they don't know how to cook a hamburger,
[00:19:28.561 --> 00:19:34.127]  They don't even know how guns work, they don't know how electricity works, how gardening works, they don't know anything.
[00:19:35.688 --> 00:19:36.109]  Anything.
[00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:48.582]  I've worked in farming and ranching and everything, and construction, and I know a lot about guns, and I feel unprepared.
[00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:58.995]  And then I, because I'm no expert at any of that, I'm just a generalist, but I look at the average leftist, I mean, they are extremely domesticated and stupid.
[00:20:00.796 --> 00:20:08.940]  But they always count on the military, the same one they just injected with poison shots, and they're attacking.
[00:20:10.821 --> 00:20:16.524]  He's going to form up, and is going to march out,
[00:20:17.614 --> 00:20:19.335]  And win a war, but that's not what they're really planning.
[00:20:19.355 --> 00:20:35.707]  They plan on civil unrest and break down a food chain, and a supply chain, and then just say, do what we say, accept the new global ID, accept the new ESG score, accept the new unified ballot sheet for the central bank digital currency, and we will fix it.
[00:20:36.328 --> 00:20:41.131]  They just plan on holding us hostage at a much more intense level than we saw during the whole COVID scam.
[00:20:42.893 --> 00:20:45.635]  So they've only got limited power on what they can do, and they know that.
[00:20:46.857 --> 00:20:49.179]  That's why they want to trick us into offensive action.
[00:20:53.803 --> 00:20:54.743]  Because they know they're losing.
[00:20:54.924 --> 00:20:59.127]  That said, I'm not going to any FEMA camps.
[00:20:59.347 --> 00:21:00.968]  My family's not going to any FEMA camps.
[00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:06.433]  And if people came to take me to one, I would try to go out the back door and not have a confrontation.
[00:21:06.873 --> 00:21:09.956]  But that said, you're not taking me to one of your damn concentration camps.
[00:21:10.768 --> 00:21:14.912]  I'm not like the folks in World War II that loaded on the trains and did all that.
[00:21:15.072 --> 00:21:20.136]  Not going, not getting on the buses, not happening, not going to happen.
[00:21:20.937 --> 00:21:27.163]  And everybody else needs to make that decision whether you're going to go ahead and go to one of these damn places where they're going to shoot you up and kill your ass.
[00:21:27.883 --> 00:21:30.706]  And the average compartmentalized people running it won't even understand what's going on.
[00:21:31.366 --> 00:21:31.947]  And that's the thing.
[00:21:33.266 --> 00:21:41.791]  The compartmentalized people that they want to enforce all this, on average, do not really understand what's going on, but they are more and more, and when they do get presented with the facts, they join us.
[00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:43.733]  I'm gonna say it again.
[00:21:44.833 --> 00:22:01.744]  The local police are not your enemy, the fire department's not your enemy, the health department's not your enemy, the rank-and-file FBI is not your enemy, not the federal marshals, any of them, but their bosses are bad guys, on average, and are our enemy, and they intend on having this confrontation, this civil war.
[00:22:02.731 --> 00:22:05.533]  Raskin's one of the top strategists in their meetings.
[00:22:05.553 --> 00:22:06.013]  It's come out.
[00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:09.335]  And he's up there giggling and laughing about Civil War and how much fun it's going to be.
[00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:19.322]  Well, that's because he thinks he's going to give you orders to go start a fight with the American people who've already been totally put to the ringer.
[00:22:20.854 --> 00:22:21.814]  And so, you know what?
[00:22:21.874 --> 00:22:25.816]  If America is dumb enough to buy this crap and kill each other, we get what we deserve.
[00:22:26.756 --> 00:22:31.158]  But you will not defeat the New World Order killing a bunch of police and a bunch of feds.
[00:22:31.238 --> 00:22:33.078]  And I don't say that to kiss their ass, okay?
[00:22:36.159 --> 00:22:37.600]  That's why the higher-up feds want me arrested.
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:46.123]  I say that because if there is a civil war and they successfully trigger one, they're going to go out and commit massacres and blame it on us.
[00:22:47.003 --> 00:22:49.504]  Because they don't care how many of their minions get killed.
[00:22:50.871 --> 00:22:59.436]  So, all I'm saying is if a real civil war kicks off, it's like a video game, where if you shoot the bad guys, you know, you lose score.
[00:23:00.156 --> 00:23:10.482]  Well, in this video game, the cops and the feds, even if they're marching out to attack you, if you're dumb enough to engage them, and dumb enough to kill them, you're giving Raskin what he wants.
[00:23:13.583 --> 00:23:20.087]  In this atmosphere, in a situation like this, it's people like Raskin that think that they're immune.
[00:23:21.636 --> 00:23:22.896]  I think that he can get away with all this.
[00:23:25.137 --> 00:23:27.117]  And I'm not seeing harm ahead on Raskin's head.
[00:23:28.737 --> 00:23:30.678]  But he's the one saying he wants a civil war.
[00:23:31.118 --> 00:23:39.639]  If he successfully kicks one off, and people are running around murdering each other on both sides like a bunch of idiots, just know who's responsible.
[00:23:40.039 --> 00:23:40.479]  It's him.
[00:23:41.579 --> 00:23:42.700]  And the other scum around him.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.640]  And people like Hotez.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.420]  And people like Swallowswell.
[00:23:49.981 --> 00:23:50.101]  And...
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.983]  When they start fearing the people, we'll have liberty.
[00:23:55.245 --> 00:23:56.627]  When we fear them, we have tyranny.
[00:23:58.429 --> 00:23:59.270]  That's Thomas Jefferson.
[00:24:00.932 --> 00:24:02.333]  When the people fear the government, there's tyranny.
[00:24:02.353 --> 00:24:03.695]  When the government fears the people, there's liberty.
[00:24:05.317 --> 00:24:08.100]  This government is run by psychotic criminals that are out of control.
[00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:18.634]  And they've got a lot of really good people on average working under them that are compartmentalized, and we have to get the word out to all those people and stop this before it continues to get out of hand.
[00:24:19.135 --> 00:24:26.038]  Because again, I'm not the one up here talking about civil war and gunfights and food cutoff and burning cities.
[00:24:26.438 --> 00:24:32.081]  They're the ones with all the TV shows and movies and professors and talk show hosts saying how great it's going to be.
[00:24:32.941 --> 00:24:37.783]  How they're going to re-educate us and all this stuff, and how there's going to be a civil war, and I'm here saying no.
[00:24:38.023 --> 00:24:39.484]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:24:40.044 --> 00:24:41.164]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:24:43.005 --> 00:24:44.445]  I like the electricity turning on.
[00:24:44.846 --> 00:24:46.126]  You know, I like visiting my family.
[00:24:46.186 --> 00:24:49.227]  I like, you know, my seven-year-old daughter going to school and picking her up from school.
[00:24:49.767 --> 00:24:52.188]  I like pulling into a Mexican food restaurant and eating some enchiladas.
[00:24:52.749 --> 00:24:54.089]  I like going for a hike in the woods.
[00:24:54.109 --> 00:24:55.910]  I like going out with friends on their boat.
[00:24:56.806 --> 00:25:00.849]  And I like living in a free country, but the nation is under attack.
[00:25:00.989 --> 00:25:02.250]  The borders are dissolved.
[00:25:02.531 --> 00:25:04.512]  There is massive human trafficking, including of children.
[00:25:06.014 --> 00:25:13.219]  And the people running the federal government are at war with our dollar, our border, our sovereignty, our military, with everything.
[00:25:15.061 --> 00:25:20.145]  And their main plan is to get a civil war going in this country, and they've said that.
[00:25:20.265 --> 00:25:22.207]  So, they're the clear and present danger.
[00:25:22.487 --> 00:25:24.609]  They're the bad guys publicly plotting all this crap.
[00:25:26.207 --> 00:25:30.409]  They said before they stole the election four years ago in the New York Times at a big war game with John Podesta.
[00:25:30.429 --> 00:25:31.970]  They said, we're not going to accept him.
[00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:33.310]  We're going to have our own electors.
[00:25:33.571 --> 00:25:37.672]  We're going to go have our own thing in Colorado, and we're going to put Joe Biden in.
[00:25:38.833 --> 00:25:41.614]  That's everything they accused Trump of they were actually doing.
[00:25:43.335 --> 00:25:53.320]  And so they're going to do that again, except they're going to activate Black Lives Matter and Antifa and their Islamic sleeper cells that you know are allied with the left.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.521]  That's why Biden's been so standoffish about Iran.
[00:25:58.241 --> 00:25:59.802]  And they're going to blow this country up.
[00:26:00.883 --> 00:26:03.604]  And at that point, I'm a talk show host.
[00:26:03.664 --> 00:26:04.744]  It's all way ahead of the curve.
[00:26:04.904 --> 00:26:05.264]  I'm here.
[00:26:05.824 --> 00:26:07.505]  We'll be taking off the air, guaranteed.
[00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:08.706]  I'm just going to take care of my family.
[00:26:09.026 --> 00:26:13.347]  I'm going to say, hey folks, it's your ballgame now.
[00:26:14.228 --> 00:26:17.129]  And I say that because I want it to be clear where I stand.
[00:26:18.646 --> 00:26:21.589]  They take me off the air, they'll take everybody else off the air with the internet kill switch.
[00:26:21.689 --> 00:26:23.912]  Only government stuff will be available in their mouthpieces.
[00:26:24.352 --> 00:26:25.113]  And then what will they do?
[00:26:25.153 --> 00:26:29.638]  They'll blow up a federal building and say that, oh, the guy did it because he's a Trump supporter, an Alex Jones supporter.
[00:26:30.018 --> 00:26:33.341]  That is not true, and none of my supporters would ever do something like that.
[00:26:33.982 --> 00:26:43.669]  But that's the real issue here is once they cut the communications then they can stage events and blame it on the good guys to try to get public opinion on their side.
[00:26:43.949 --> 00:26:52.916]  That's why I've got to say all this now so people remember this and see this and can underground show this clip so that people know because I'm already having the war game.
[00:26:53.496 --> 00:26:54.777]  The worst case scenario is here.
[00:26:55.177 --> 00:26:57.018]  Now, we've got a very good chance of getting Trump in.
[00:26:57.419 --> 00:26:58.699]  The globalists are badly coordinated.
[00:26:58.739 --> 00:26:59.640]  Everything they're doing is failing.
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:04.723]  More and more of their people in government, corporations, know what's going on, are leaking information and not following orders.
[00:27:05.224 --> 00:27:08.286]  Bare minimum, just don't follow orders to attack the American people.
[00:27:09.086 --> 00:27:16.751]  And then the American people, just bare minimum, try to stay out of the way during a civil war, shooting random police, even if they're coming to do bad things, you know, just try to stay out of their way.
[00:27:17.231 --> 00:27:19.293]  You know, because it's a disaster.
[00:27:22.564 --> 00:27:24.605]  This whole thing is a damn disaster.
[00:27:25.206 --> 00:27:37.535]  Alright, I'm going to get to the specifics on the UN, then into this horrible VP, and I'm going to give the number out and take your calls, and then Roger Stone is coming up, and Max Keiser, but we'll take some calls.
[00:27:38.376 --> 00:27:39.237]  Nitric Boost.
[00:27:40.157 --> 00:27:40.658]  Turmeric 95.
[00:27:42.958 --> 00:27:45.840]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:51.763]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[00:27:52.263 --> 00:27:59.408]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[00:27:59.968 --> 00:28:01.949]  They let us private label their products.
[00:28:01.969 --> 00:28:02.950]  That's why you've already heard of them.
[00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:04.771]  Bodies Old Turmeric Formula?
[00:28:05.071 --> 00:28:07.832]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[00:28:08.072 --> 00:28:09.392]  This is just their brand of that.
[00:28:09.733 --> 00:28:13.034]  And so, it is available under Turmeric 95.
[00:28:13.414 --> 00:28:14.034]  That's the name.
[00:28:14.295 --> 00:28:20.777]  So, we're sold out of bodies, but we have Turmeric 95 that is, again, the same concentrated turmeric.
[00:28:20.997 --> 00:28:22.018]  Same thing with Nitric Boost.
[00:28:22.498 --> 00:28:24.120]  Nitric Boost came from this company.
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.162]  They even let us use their name.
[00:28:26.443 --> 00:28:27.444]  It's now our best seller.
[00:28:27.644 --> 00:28:28.645]  We sold out of our version.
[00:28:28.925 --> 00:28:30.367]  Their version has a white model.
[00:28:30.707 --> 00:28:32.109]  It's the exact same thing.
[00:28:32.629 --> 00:28:34.211]  You get it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:28:34.472 --> 00:28:37.074]  So check out InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:28:38.015 --> 00:28:38.296]  All right.
[00:28:38.436 --> 00:28:40.558]  Again, I want this to sink in for you right now.
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.641]  Here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28:44.568 --> 00:28:45.909]  The UN is all over the news.
[00:28:46.949 --> 00:28:52.833]  Around the world, our corrupt politicians are all over TV saying they want to use NATO and UN troops in a new pandemic.
[00:28:53.233 --> 00:28:57.956]  They're rolling out mousepox, bird flu, saying COVID's back, all this stuff right now.
[00:28:58.936 --> 00:29:01.177]  Right in time for the election, and for control around the world.
[00:29:03.319 --> 00:29:07.521]  They're also all over the news, and in fiction, just a full push that there's going to be a civil war.
[00:29:08.461 --> 00:29:09.082]  You know about that.
[00:29:09.942 --> 00:29:10.783]  I told you they're planning it.
[00:29:10.883 --> 00:29:12.684]  Now, they're all over the place saying that's their plan.
[00:29:14.053 --> 00:29:14.654]  This is crazy.
[00:29:16.075 --> 00:29:19.258]  When I played at the Jamie Raskin Club the last two days in a row.
[00:29:20.299 --> 00:29:22.181]  Up there just like a pig and you know what?
[00:29:22.221 --> 00:29:22.761]  So happy.
[00:29:22.841 --> 00:29:23.962]  Like the cat ate the canary.
[00:29:26.304 --> 00:29:29.667]  Talking about how we're a bunch of dumb pawns and how they're going to have us all kill each other.
[00:29:30.268 --> 00:29:31.950]  That really makes me angry.
[00:29:33.471 --> 00:29:34.512]  Because I don't like being played.
[00:29:35.893 --> 00:29:38.476]  And I sure don't like seeing Americans kill each other.
[00:29:38.516 --> 00:29:39.617]  But this guy thinks it's funny.
[00:29:40.745 --> 00:29:42.426]  And they set me up on January 6th.
[00:29:43.206 --> 00:29:44.887]  Trump asked for 10,000 National Guard.
[00:29:45.207 --> 00:29:47.088]  They refused it, even though he could have overridden it.
[00:29:47.728 --> 00:29:49.069]  Milley threatened to resign.
[00:29:49.089 --> 00:29:53.511]  And the Secret Service said, it's time for you to go to the Capitol during Trump's speech.
[00:29:54.431 --> 00:30:01.975]  When they'd already started the riot there, I get there, I climb up on the back of the chairs, a big stack of chairs, and I say, don't go in, don't go in.
[00:30:02.015 --> 00:30:03.376]  My bullhorn only went 100 yards.
[00:30:04.256 --> 00:30:05.277]  And thousands didn't go in.
[00:30:05.937 --> 00:30:07.678]  And most people agreed with me and said, thanks, Alex.
[00:30:07.698 --> 00:30:08.638]  We didn't know what was going on.
[00:30:08.918 --> 00:30:10.039]  But a few said, you're a wimp.
[00:30:11.923 --> 00:30:12.563]  Let's storm it.
[00:30:16.044 --> 00:30:19.024]  That was a small minority of people, provocateurs, people like Ray Epps.
[00:30:21.105 --> 00:30:26.046]  But the issue here is that it wasn't wimpy for me to get up there and try to stop people.
[00:30:26.106 --> 00:30:27.166]  I said, this is gonna be a new Kent State.
[00:30:27.466 --> 00:30:28.626]  They're gonna kill people, which they did.
[00:30:28.646 --> 00:30:29.367]  They killed four people.
[00:30:30.147 --> 00:30:30.847]  None of them cops.
[00:30:31.807 --> 00:30:32.727]  I don't want cops to die either.
[00:30:33.247 --> 00:30:35.908]  So this is a no-brainer that anybody
[00:30:37.247 --> 00:30:45.874]  That you're hanging out with, or you're shooting with, or anybody that's trying to get you to talk about killing people, or train offensively to go out and have some war with the federal government, is a Fed.
[00:30:47.075 --> 00:30:47.676]  99% chance.
[00:30:48.256 --> 00:30:54.861]  And the Patriot Front, all these groups trying to stir stuff up, a lot of them are useful idiots, but I guarantee you there's Feds all over the place there.
[00:30:55.382 --> 00:31:00.166]  And just think what they did with Governor Whitmer, and the fake kidnapping plot there that came out in court.
[00:31:01.946 --> 00:31:02.907]  In all three of the trials.
[00:31:03.427 --> 00:31:04.948]  That's why two of the trials, they'd let him go.
[00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:07.611]  They finally rigged one of them and got convictions on some of them.
[00:31:08.271 --> 00:31:09.372]  So, that's where we are.
[00:31:10.313 --> 00:31:15.337]  And I can harp about this all day long because I have a real sense of dread here.
[00:31:16.377 --> 00:31:23.323]  And a real sense of extreme frustration that it's enough to walk into one trap on January 6th.
[00:31:23.463 --> 00:31:24.804]  I don't want to see us all do it again.
[00:31:25.625 --> 00:31:27.026]  And again, we've had so many big Trump rallies.
[00:31:27.046 --> 00:31:27.806]  We've had two in D.C.
[00:31:27.826 --> 00:31:28.407]  the month before.
[00:31:28.427 --> 00:31:30.288]  A half million at both those.
[00:31:31.277 --> 00:31:32.478]  We had a stage set up for Trump.
[00:31:32.498 --> 00:31:33.359]  He was going to go speak there.
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.200]  And then nobody was there.
[00:31:35.241 --> 00:31:35.981]  No security.
[00:31:36.622 --> 00:31:37.863]  Secret Service wouldn't take him there.
[00:31:38.003 --> 00:31:38.844]  They set us up.
[00:31:40.125 --> 00:31:41.366]  And Trump said, go there peacefully.
[00:31:41.386 --> 00:31:43.808]  And they're trying to put him in prison for that.
[00:31:43.828 --> 00:31:48.692]  They're trying to put Tommy Robinson in prison for saying, don't be violent, be peaceful.
[00:31:48.933 --> 00:31:49.873]  Saying he called for violence.
[00:31:50.794 --> 00:31:56.639]  And now the EU and the UK want to arrest Elon Musk for having free speech.
[00:31:56.659 --> 00:31:57.900]  And they're blaming the riots on him.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:03.001]  No, their policies are bringing in millions of Muslims and letting them be above the law is what's triggering the anger.
[00:32:04.642 --> 00:32:09.803]  So, we're winning this culturally, economically, politically.
[00:32:10.143 --> 00:32:11.924]  They needed to get us to violence.
[00:32:11.944 --> 00:32:14.104]  They need to get us to violence very, very quickly.
[00:32:15.365 --> 00:32:27.668]  And so I would suggest and I would ask that the other talk show hosts and other people that I know watch this show get on the ball and start focusing on this, which is starting to happen.
[00:32:28.493 --> 00:32:30.914]  I heard Glenn Beck talking about this same subject this morning.
[00:32:31.474 --> 00:32:32.795]  I just said, let's see what Glenn's talking about.
[00:32:32.895 --> 00:32:33.875]  What, the 1200 OAI?
[00:32:36.096 --> 00:32:36.356]  Boom.
[00:32:37.137 --> 00:32:37.957]  Talked about it for 10 minutes.
[00:32:38.057 --> 00:32:38.457]  That's good.
[00:32:39.117 --> 00:32:39.938]  He has a giant audience.
[00:32:40.218 --> 00:32:40.838]  He's a smart guy.
[00:32:42.079 --> 00:32:44.680]  It sounds radical to say the Feds are planning civil war.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:45.500]  They're out of control.
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:46.100]  They are!
[00:32:47.401 --> 00:32:50.282]  And I'm gonna ask the Feds themselves that aren't part of the command structure.
[00:32:50.622 --> 00:32:52.643]  Do you really want a physical war with us?
[00:32:52.943 --> 00:32:53.664]  Obviously you don't.
[00:32:54.644 --> 00:32:55.344]  This is stupid.
[00:32:56.045 --> 00:32:56.765]  This is idiotic.
[00:32:58.152 --> 00:33:00.893]  And I played this clip probably 500 times over the years.
[00:33:00.933 --> 00:33:01.593]  I'll just mention it.
[00:33:02.193 --> 00:33:08.776]  From Russia With Love opening scene, where the head of Spectre calls in his underlings and says, look at the Siamese fighting fish.
[00:33:08.816 --> 00:33:10.296]  Yeah, they're brave, but on the whole stupid.
[00:33:10.857 --> 00:33:12.417]  You have the two that basically kill each other.
[00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:13.778]  One dies, the other's wounded.
[00:33:14.118 --> 00:33:17.419]  Then the smart one swoops in after he's had the two groups fight each other.
[00:33:18.837 --> 00:33:20.037]  That's basically what we're facing.
[00:33:20.718 --> 00:33:31.141]  So it is a big deal to have Peter Hotez and others saying let's put NATO troops during the next pandemic and the UN troops in America because we're quote saving lives.
[00:33:32.182 --> 00:33:35.303]  Here's Hotez and then back to back let's go to Naomi Wolf talking about it.
[00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:43.434]  Fortunately, I have to give you a very long, I-don't-know-the-answer-to-your-question answer, because it is very complicated.
[00:33:43.474 --> 00:33:51.119]  And quite honestly, you know, the health sector doesn't know what to do, because this is now first and foremost a political problem.
[00:33:52.239 --> 00:34:00.224]  And what I've said to the Biden administration is the health sector can't solve this on its own.
[00:34:00.244 --> 00:34:01.605]  We're going to have to bring in
[00:34:03.001 --> 00:34:08.543]  Homeland Security, Commerce Department, Justice Department to help us understand how to do this.
[00:34:08.703 --> 00:34:21.168]  And I've said the same with, I met with Dr. Tedros last month in Geneva, WHO, the Director General, to say I don't know that the World Health Organization can solve this on our own.
[00:34:21.228 --> 00:34:23.729]  We need the other United Nations agencies
[00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:33.771]  NATO, this is a security problem because it's no longer a theoretical construct or some arcane academic exercise.
[00:34:34.231 --> 00:34:39.453]  200,000 Americans died because of anti-vaccine aggression, anti-science aggression.
[00:34:39.953 --> 00:34:53.416]  And so this is now a lethal force that, and now I feel as a pediatric vaccine scientist, it's just as though it's important, just as it's important for me to make new vaccines to save lives,
[00:34:54.096 --> 00:34:59.479]  The other side of saving lives is countering this anti-vaccine aggression.
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:03.742]  And so they're trying to militarize medical dissent.
[00:35:04.162 --> 00:35:06.484]  They're trying to criminalize medical dissent.
[00:35:07.444 --> 00:35:08.745]  And so listen to his language.
[00:35:08.765 --> 00:35:15.910]  And I've made this case ever since I wrote The End of America, and I looked at how democracies turn into fascist states or totalitarian states.
[00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:22.394]  There's always this mission with language where free speech turns into violence.
[00:35:23.355 --> 00:35:34.202]  Whether it's incitement or subversion, or in his case, he's coining some phrases that have probably been focus group tested, and there's probably a campaign with a global ad agency waiting in the works to release them.
[00:35:34.903 --> 00:35:37.885]  Anti-science aggression and anti-vaccine aggression.
[00:35:38.185 --> 00:35:41.348]  Well, that makes you and me, my friend, aggressors.
[00:35:41.728 --> 00:35:44.370]  Anti-science and anti-vaccine aggressors.
[00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.031]  So who's being aggressed?
[00:35:46.772 --> 00:35:48.253]  We're creating victims.
[00:35:49.133 --> 00:35:55.635]  He's claiming that we've killed 200,000 people through our anti-science aggression that makes us murderers.
[00:35:55.955 --> 00:36:02.136]  This is a brilliant rhetorical tactic to deflect from the fact that I'm saying that they're murderers, right?
[00:36:02.176 --> 00:36:05.717]  That they created a mass murder through these injections.
[00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:15.980]  So by doing this and then bringing in, he's really, it's like a mafia type threat, you know, bringing in the Justice Department, Department of Homeland Security, NATO,
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:16.680]  Right?
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:27.784]  Multiple layers of, like, federal law enforcement, you know, meta-federal law enforcement, global law enforcement, the UN, right?
[00:36:27.824 --> 00:36:28.824]  Meta-national.
[00:36:29.224 --> 00:36:37.607]  Well, if he can get the UN to adjudicate our anti-science aggression, that transcends our rights under the Constitution.
[00:36:38.667 --> 00:36:40.108]  He's basically serving as their little bitch.
[00:36:40.168 --> 00:36:40.408]  I'm sorry.
[00:36:40.448 --> 00:36:42.969]  I try to be nice, but that man is just so... You have trouble with that, Naomi.
[00:36:42.989 --> 00:36:44.510]  You have trouble being nice.
[00:37:07.082 --> 00:37:11.744]  If you go back to State Department memorandum 7277 we showed on screen earlier, they said they would use U.N.
[00:37:11.764 --> 00:37:18.827]  troops in America for civil uprisings or viruses, and then they repeated that on and on and on.
[00:37:18.847 --> 00:37:22.828]  It's in my film Endgame that I made 17, 18 years ago, showing the U.N.
[00:37:22.869 --> 00:37:28.431]  documents, and then Operation Lockstep in 2010, described everything they would do.
[00:37:29.591 --> 00:37:38.213]  And then in 2004, George Herbert Walker Bush put it into the pandemic preparedness plan, the mask, the six-foot social distancing, all this crap has been pre-planned.
[00:37:38.653 --> 00:37:57.897]  And I'm always explaining, I don't know when they're going to pull it, I don't know when they're going to do it, but they're not building emergency COVID-slash-virus centers, giant camps, in Canada, in the U.S., in Mexico, in the U.K., in Europe, and Australia and New Zealand for no reason.
[00:37:59.344 --> 00:38:04.747]  It's their cover for martial law when the world financial system that's at the end of its bubble goes down.
[00:38:05.467 --> 00:38:11.210]  And the UN, the WF, got it all ready for the vaccine passport as the new global ID.
[00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:13.891]  And Australia has already officially adopted it.
[00:38:15.592 --> 00:38:16.632]  So have places like Italy.
[00:38:17.293 --> 00:38:19.293]  So this is a plan we're living through.
[00:38:19.333 --> 00:38:20.934]  And the good news is people aren't complying.
[00:38:20.974 --> 00:38:21.815]  It's not going well.
[00:38:22.295 --> 00:38:23.055]  They don't care.
[00:38:23.475 --> 00:38:26.457]  They're now saying bird flu, monkey pox, new COVID.
[00:38:27.779 --> 00:38:30.680]  I've got all the articles and local, I've got dozens of videos here.
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.180]  You want to see them?
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:31.900]  I guess I could play them.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:36.301]  They're very obnoxious and annoying, but it's time to wear your mask again.
[00:38:36.501 --> 00:38:50.325]  LA, California, New York, New York City, England, London, Dublin, Ireland, Berlin, Germany, Paris, France.
[00:38:50.425 --> 00:38:52.345]  It's all the same global propaganda.
[00:38:53.246 --> 00:38:54.086]  Sydney, Australia.
[00:38:56.141 --> 00:38:56.801]  So they're doing it.
[00:38:56.881 --> 00:38:58.042]  They're planning it.
[00:38:58.122 --> 00:39:02.144]  So we have to get ahead of it and speak out against it and say we're not going to buy it.
[00:39:02.665 --> 00:39:04.246]  And Hotez says, we're violent.
[00:39:04.266 --> 00:39:07.327]  We killed 200,000 people with our anti-vaccine aggression.
[00:39:07.828 --> 00:39:08.888]  Their shot didn't work.
[00:39:09.949 --> 00:39:11.030]  It's supposedly going to stop COVID.
[00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:11.510]  It didn't.
[00:39:12.551 --> 00:39:14.472]  And then the shots made all those people sick or die.
[00:39:14.492 --> 00:39:21.796]  And he just sits there as their spokesperson saying this.
[00:39:24.767 --> 00:39:29.390]  So, I've got all the news on Tim Walz.
[00:39:30.031 --> 00:39:33.873]  And I've got all the news on the attacks on free speech and them wanting to arrest Elon Musk.
[00:39:33.893 --> 00:39:36.695]  And I've got all the news on the economy and breaking.
[00:39:37.176 --> 00:39:40.118]  Far-left squad member Cori Bush loses in Missouri primary.
[00:39:40.178 --> 00:39:40.758]  That's good news.
[00:39:42.139 --> 00:39:47.203]  Biden administration declares war on plastic silverware as green obsession goes insane.
[00:39:50.299 --> 00:40:00.647]  We've got a lot of news to cover, but I also want to open the phones up on the subject of open discussion of UN and NATO troops in America, and open discussion about how the left's going to trigger a civil war.
[00:40:01.628 --> 00:40:02.429]  They're out in the open.
[00:40:02.549 --> 00:40:11.436]  What do we do about it with peaceful civil disobedience and activism to put it on the front burner and get ahead of this with 90 days to the election?
[00:40:11.656 --> 00:40:18.622]  Because as you approach the election in 90 days, the rollout accelerates, and then it goes into overdrive when he's president-elect.
[00:40:20.285 --> 00:40:26.027]  And they had this plan on the shelf, and then Trump was able to beat him on the landslide in 2016.
[00:40:26.127 --> 00:40:31.849]  And then they went ahead and launched it, but it partially failed in Trump, under Trump.
[00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:38.112]  So now they've been in a holding pattern for four years with O'Biden, and they're going to try it again.
[00:40:38.152 --> 00:40:39.792]  They are trying it again right now.
[00:40:40.092 --> 00:40:40.893]  There's no doubt about that.
[00:40:41.813 --> 00:40:45.714]  So, what do we do to get ahead of that right now?
[00:40:47.535 --> 00:40:48.695]  That's the big question.
[00:40:48.755 --> 00:40:49.596]  That's the big issue.
[00:40:50.529 --> 00:40:54.170]  Now I got Roger Stone coming up in about, in exactly 45 minutes.
[00:40:55.191 --> 00:40:57.591]  So I'm only going to put eight calls on the board.
[00:40:58.192 --> 00:40:59.452]  That way I'll get to all of you before Roger.
[00:41:00.432 --> 00:41:01.193]  The toll-free number is 877-789-2539.
[00:41:01.213 --> 00:41:01.333]  877-789-Alex.
[00:41:01.353 --> 00:41:01.393]  877-789-2539.
[00:41:01.433 --> 00:41:03.714]  On this subject of civil unrest, martial law, what are the triggers for it?
[00:41:03.734 --> 00:41:05.854]  It's a huge subject area.
[00:41:05.874 --> 00:41:07.175]  Open discussion of UN troops in America.
[00:41:19.974 --> 00:41:21.575]  The Democrats say they're going to trigger a civil war.
[00:41:22.156 --> 00:41:25.378]  What do we do when people are openly running another criminal operation against us?
[00:41:26.679 --> 00:41:28.220]  Well, we spotlight who the bad guys are.
[00:41:30.162 --> 00:41:34.125]  And we get the governors and legislatures and attorney generals to take action, which they're doing.
[00:41:35.066 --> 00:41:41.271]  And we let the people that want to sit back in the shadows and punch the buttons and pull the strings know, you're going to be held accountable.
[00:41:42.652 --> 00:41:43.552]  And that's how you stop them.
[00:41:44.953 --> 00:41:45.214]  All right.
[00:41:46.345 --> 00:41:53.248]  I want to, as we get ready to go to your calls at 877-789-2539 on this important subject, and I'll hit the other subjects as well.
[00:41:54.108 --> 00:41:55.208]  Roger joins us and more.
[00:41:55.308 --> 00:41:58.390]  Got a lot of clips, a lot of insanity from this Tim Walls guy.
[00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:02.531]  I knew who he was and I'd covered him some, but my God, he was way worse than I thought.
[00:42:02.571 --> 00:42:07.373]  This guy is a globalist, thoroughbred, New World Order sicko.
[00:42:08.493 --> 00:42:09.574]  So we've got all that coming up.
[00:42:10.854 --> 00:42:12.915]  Elon Musk saying that
[00:42:15.714 --> 00:42:18.817]  Kamala Harris is a communist, which is what, in her words, she is.
[00:42:19.217 --> 00:42:19.977]  Classic communist.
[00:42:21.279 --> 00:42:23.200]  We'll be looking at it all coming up here today.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.504]  And people ask me, I saw it on X a lot of questions, why did I have Jackson Hinkle on yesterday?
[00:42:28.104 --> 00:42:28.805]  I'm not a communist.
[00:42:28.845 --> 00:42:32.087]  I disagree with him on that big time, but he's an interesting reporter.
[00:42:32.127 --> 00:42:33.308]  He was down in Venezuela for two weeks.
[00:42:33.368 --> 00:42:34.349]  Let's get the other side.
[00:42:34.709 --> 00:42:35.890]  You're big boys and girls.
[00:42:36.811 --> 00:42:37.512]  I'm a big boy.
[00:42:38.052 --> 00:42:39.233]  You can hear the other side.
[00:42:39.673 --> 00:42:41.375]  If Maduro would come on the show, I'd have him on.
[00:42:42.961 --> 00:42:44.442]  The left never wants to hear from the other side.
[00:42:44.682 --> 00:42:47.664]  I want to hear the different factions and perspectives here.
[00:42:48.105 --> 00:42:53.649]  But just because I have somebody on doesn't mean I agree with a lot of what they had to say.
[00:42:53.809 --> 00:42:55.850]  So let's be 100% clear about that.
[00:42:57.211 --> 00:43:08.800]  Now, since I mentioned it for posterity, here's a clip of almost four years ago when I was being set up along with Trump and I got there trying to stop people from going into the Capitol.
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:09.120]  Here it is.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:15.524]  Alright, I need everybody out of the way because I've got to get this crowd off there because they're trying to provide deterrence so Trump won't come.
[00:43:15.584 --> 00:43:15.805]  Easy.
[00:43:15.845 --> 00:43:16.405]  Watch the tree.
[00:43:16.445 --> 00:43:17.366]  Watch the people sitting down.
[00:43:17.426 --> 00:43:17.546]  USA!
[00:43:17.566 --> 00:43:17.766]  USA!
[00:43:17.906 --> 00:43:17.966]  USA!
[00:43:18.006 --> 00:43:18.387]  USA!
[00:43:18.407 --> 00:43:18.647]  USA!
[00:43:18.787 --> 00:43:19.308]  USA!
[00:43:19.828 --> 00:43:19.988]  USA!
[00:43:20.048 --> 00:43:20.689]  USA!
[00:43:30.555 --> 00:43:30.995]  USA!
[00:43:31.315 --> 00:43:31.855]  USA!
[00:43:31.955 --> 00:43:32.896]  USA!
[00:43:32.956 --> 00:43:34.356]  Listen to me.
[00:43:34.396 --> 00:43:35.837]  Listen to me.
[00:43:35.897 --> 00:43:38.918]  We've got a permit on the other side.
[00:43:39.398 --> 00:43:40.598]  It's great that this happened.
[00:43:40.918 --> 00:43:43.639]  But the Trumps not going to come when we've taken this over.
[00:43:44.119 --> 00:43:45.160]  We're not Antifa.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.880]  We're not DeOtto.
[00:43:47.341 --> 00:43:47.881]  You're amazing.
[00:43:47.981 --> 00:43:48.621]  I love you.
[00:43:49.081 --> 00:43:50.802]  Let's march around on the other side.
[00:43:51.382 --> 00:43:56.303]  And let's not fight the police and give the system what they want.
[00:43:56.684 --> 00:43:57.644]  We are peaceful.
[00:43:59.241 --> 00:44:12.066]  We won this election, and as much as I love seeing the Trump flags flying over this meeting to not have the confrontation with the police, we're going to make that the story.
[00:44:12.966 --> 00:44:19.008]  I'm going to march to the other side where we have a stage where we can speak and occupy peacefully.
[00:44:19.709 --> 00:44:22.770]  Tell everybody behind you, march to the other side.
[00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:24.971]  March to the other side.
[00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:36.745]  You guys are great, but the police provocateurs have caused a problem and the police are throwing flashbangs.
[00:44:36.805 --> 00:44:39.730]  We don't want to have a kid state here.
[00:44:40.632 --> 00:44:50.134]  So, I love you, we're saving the republic, this is beautiful, but please tell everyone you know, march to the other side!
[00:44:50.655 --> 00:44:57.216]  We're gonna march, Trump, Trump is gonna speak over here!
[00:44:57.256 --> 00:45:01.137]  Trump is coming, Trump is coming on the other side!
[00:45:01.217 --> 00:45:05.278]  So march with us, go slow!
[00:45:07.279 --> 00:45:07.919]  And again,
[00:45:08.819 --> 00:45:11.341]  I didn't know at that time that he'd cancelled going.
[00:45:12.702 --> 00:45:15.665]  So I was trying to, and I predicted they would kill Ashley Babbitt.
[00:45:15.725 --> 00:45:16.926]  I mean, they killed people, they did.
[00:45:17.886 --> 00:45:18.407]  Right after this.
[00:45:20.028 --> 00:45:22.450]  But I did get a mass of people away from going in the building.
[00:45:24.432 --> 00:45:25.973]  For that, they tried to put me in prison.
[00:45:26.433 --> 00:45:27.954]  And Raskin, you know, interrogated me.
[00:45:28.495 --> 00:45:30.496]  And of course, he destroyed the records of it.
[00:45:30.516 --> 00:45:31.177]  It all came out.
[00:45:34.201 --> 00:45:43.409]  So, we should post this whole video, because the one that's viral on X was the one Jack Pasubic that day posted, because I was banned on X then, and it's just one shot of me.
[00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:48.453]  We should post this whole 12-minute video, you know, what really happened on January 6th.
[00:45:48.553 --> 00:45:51.395]  Alex Jones releases what really happened on January 6th.
[00:45:51.435 --> 00:45:57.440]  We should call it that, and put that out on X right now, because it's important to get this out.
[00:46:00.222 --> 00:46:00.482]  All right.
[00:46:02.765 --> 00:46:09.354]  Jim, Corey, Josh, John, Hammer, Jeff, and others, we're going to start the next hour here soon.
[00:46:09.394 --> 00:46:10.576]  I want to add some other news now.
[00:46:11.513 --> 00:46:16.997]  And I'll go right to your phone calls, head of Roger Stone, big breaking news coming up, but I'm just going to say this again.
[00:46:17.797 --> 00:46:20.519]  We are in the most dangerous point in world history, not just American history right now.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:25.243]  I need everybody to fight like your lives depend on it, to share the articles and share the videos.
[00:46:25.323 --> 00:46:27.524]  We're Alex Jones, thenfulwars.com.
[00:46:28.745 --> 00:46:30.867]  We barely stayed on air by the grace of God in your prayer.
[00:46:31.307 --> 00:46:32.388]  We're barely hanging on here.
[00:46:33.148 --> 00:46:36.070]  And if we don't have the funds, we will be shut down in the next few months.
[00:46:36.511 --> 00:46:38.993]  If we get the funds, there's a very good chance without giving out strategy.
[00:46:39.733 --> 00:46:41.894]  We're going to stay on air, by the grace of God.
[00:46:42.855 --> 00:46:48.918]  But I need you to make the decision to go, hey, I'm going to back one of the most important, informative transmissions out there that the enemy hates.

[00:46:58.344 --> 00:46:58.704]  Thank you.

[00:49:40.208 --> 00:49:41.369]  We just don't gouge you.

[00:50:00.406 --> 00:50:01.007]  I'm asking you.
[00:50:01.307 --> 00:50:01.948]  I'm in your hands.
[00:50:02.248 --> 00:50:03.129]  I'm firing the bat signal.
[00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:06.232]  All right.
[00:50:06.792 --> 00:50:07.453]  I'm going to go to break.
[00:50:08.524 --> 00:50:08.964]  We're good to go.
[00:50:33.001 --> 00:50:33.782]  We'll do the dive.
[00:50:34.744 --> 00:50:35.465]  Not a deep dive.
[00:50:35.505 --> 00:50:36.707]  A deep dive would take five hours.
[00:50:36.747 --> 00:50:37.970]  This guy, I've done the deep dive.
[00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:45.002]  This guy, I mean, just his obsession with cutting children's testicles off, little girl's breast off is next level.
[00:50:45.883 --> 00:50:46.725]  That's all coming up.
[00:50:47.998 --> 00:50:48.718]  With his monster.
[00:50:48.838 --> 00:50:50.599]  And then the Elon Musk stack is important.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:56.642]  MPs want to haul Elon Musk before Parliament after brazen UK riot post-Stoke tensions.
[00:50:57.002 --> 00:51:00.323]  He just exposed that the government stood down and the Islamists were starting him.
[00:51:00.984 --> 00:51:03.825]  Breaking Trump to hold major interview with Elon Musk Monday.
[00:51:06.046 --> 00:51:10.988]  Elon Musk goes there, makes stunning admission on X Kamala Harris is quite literally a communist.
[00:51:13.888 --> 00:51:22.731]  Right on cue, Britain's crazed leftists demand governments shut down X, prosecute Elon Musk, and even compare Platform to Nazi Germany.
[00:51:25.592 --> 00:51:29.113]  Are the authorities powerless to stop Tommy Robinson's online output?
[00:51:29.353 --> 00:51:30.553]  They say he's calling for violence.
[00:51:30.673 --> 00:51:31.573]  They never show one quote.
[00:51:31.793 --> 00:51:32.594]  He's calling for the opposite.
[00:51:34.354 --> 00:51:39.656]  They are desperate, and they want violence, and they want to arrest those of us that are trying to stop it, and they're showing you the truth.
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.141]  That's why they want to shut down X. That's why they want to shut down Trump.
[00:51:43.421 --> 00:51:45.122]  That's why they want to shut down Elon Musk.
[00:51:45.662 --> 00:51:46.862]  Because we're telling the truth.
[00:51:46.882 --> 00:51:48.183]  That's why they want to shut down Tucker Carlson.
[00:51:48.643 --> 00:51:57.747]  And that's why it's so important in this critical time that you obviously back the organizations and groups that will not back down and that are reaching tens of millions of people a day.
[00:51:58.067 --> 00:51:59.127]  Musk is reaching hundreds of millions.
[00:51:59.207 --> 00:52:00.087]  I'm reaching tens of millions.
[00:52:00.828 --> 00:52:01.888]  Tucker's reaching tens of millions.
[00:52:02.168 --> 00:52:03.949]  Joe Rogan's fully awake now, like I told you he was.
[00:52:05.652 --> 00:52:16.935]  So we've got a real shot at this, but it's so critical every new person you reach, because if the election is such a landslide for Trump, it'll be too big to rig.
[00:52:17.955 --> 00:52:23.416]  And that's why they tried to kill him on July 13th, was because they know Trump's going to win.
[00:52:23.436 --> 00:52:27.277]  And if he does win, they're planning civil unrest.
[00:52:28.763 --> 00:52:29.503]  And Civil War.
[00:52:29.983 --> 00:52:31.524]  And that's coming up with your phone calls.
[00:52:31.964 --> 00:52:33.625]  These are incredible admissions of U.N.
[00:52:33.665 --> 00:52:34.605]  troops in America.
[00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:37.126]  Do you believe they're just admitting all of this?
[00:52:37.146 --> 00:52:41.187]  Alright, we'll come back with hour number two.
[00:52:41.387 --> 00:52:45.208]  Please, share the live link at RealAlexJones, everybody you know, and those you don't know.
[00:52:46.009 --> 00:52:46.529]  Take action.
[00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:47.389]  You're the Paul Reveres.
[00:52:47.849 --> 00:52:49.830]  Share the live feed at RealAlexJones now on X.
[00:53:00.731 --> 00:53:13.544]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements, because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[00:53:13.984 --> 00:53:16.186]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[00:53:17.007 --> 00:53:22.433]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[00:53:23.487 --> 00:53:32.053]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[00:53:32.393 --> 00:53:34.255]  We had five companies making product for us.
[00:53:34.875 --> 00:53:39.378]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're InfoWars.
[00:53:40.099 --> 00:53:45.743]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[00:53:45.763 --> 00:53:48.685]  I'm not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[00:53:49.486 --> 00:53:51.007]  And they said, listen, you know
[00:53:52.216 --> 00:54:08.212]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[00:54:08.613 --> 00:54:15.280]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[00:54:16.334 --> 00:54:17.656]  We're good to go.
[00:54:28.251 --> 00:54:36.355]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private-labeled from them before we were even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[00:54:36.435 --> 00:54:43.079]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[00:54:43.239 --> 00:54:45.720]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:47.801]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[00:54:48.001 --> 00:54:57.785]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[00:54:58.405 --> 00:55:00.806]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[00:55:00.866 --> 00:55:01.926]  Take Turmeric 95.
[00:55:03.607 --> 00:55:10.310]  Turmeric 95 isn't called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:16.073]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[00:55:16.193 --> 00:55:24.717]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[00:55:24.757 --> 00:55:27.198]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line, and
[00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:41.740]  Because of the bankruptcy, the attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:46.623]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[00:55:46.703 --> 00:55:51.347]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[00:55:52.368 --> 00:55:57.591]  So I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[00:55:57.691 --> 00:55:58.292]  It's amazing.
[00:55:58.432 --> 00:55:59.352]  It's super high quality.
[00:55:59.412 --> 00:56:01.253]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[00:56:21.587 --> 00:56:22.068]  Thank you.
[00:56:50.515 --> 00:56:52.375]  We are now into hour number two.
[00:56:53.796 --> 00:57:08.199]  Taking your phone calls on the deep state, emerging out of the shadows and openly saying they want a race war, martial law, and UN troops in America as they launch their new pandemics, bird flu, monkey pox, and quote new COVID.
[00:57:09.299 --> 00:57:11.499]  So right now let's go in the order the calls are received.
[00:57:11.519 --> 00:57:14.340]  Let's talk to Hammer in Florida on Civil War.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:14.760]  Go ahead.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.421]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[00:57:19.741 --> 00:57:29.444]  I just want to say, you know, this reminds me of that movie 300, and there's a couple of lessons in that movie that I think most people don't really recognize at first.
[00:57:30.185 --> 00:57:42.849]  And the first lesson that I learned from that movie and that whole story is that when you're faced with an enemy that's determined to either kill or enslave you, being peaceful is really just surrender.
[00:57:43.689 --> 00:57:49.251]  And so, you know, I don't really see how we can avoid this because we're
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:58.267]  Regardless of whether or not we do anything offensive, they're just gonna stage something, blame it on us anyway, and we're in the same predicament.
[00:57:58.467 --> 00:58:01.930]  So, yeah, that's my two cents.
[00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:05.833]  I don't really... Well, sure, I mean, look, I'm not calling for anything against Bill Gates or anybody.
[00:58:06.353 --> 00:58:06.873]  I'm just saying...
[00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:11.773]  The way they pre-programmed it is you fight the government by going out and fighting the military.
[00:58:11.813 --> 00:58:19.920]  No, in a real civil war, if we go to that, if they start, people will go after Fauci, Bill Gates, the globals, which I'm not saying do.
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:28.327]  I'm just saying, if they want to start one, we should understand that, you know, it's the people that did this that need to be dealt with.
[00:58:30.103 --> 00:58:39.347]  Yeah, and that's what I think they know is going to happen, because we had that individual talk, I forget his name, just talking about Civil War, saying that they're all going to need bodyguards.
[00:58:39.888 --> 00:58:40.748]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:58:40.768 --> 00:58:42.069]  That's Congressman Raskin.
[00:58:43.189 --> 00:58:44.290]  Yes, that guy.
[00:58:44.490 --> 00:58:51.673]  Because that's the logical step, is not to go after your sheriff, not to go after your school board, but the people who actually voted for these laws.
[00:58:52.974 --> 00:58:57.156]  So yeah, I mean, that's... Well, it's not just voted for it, it's the people commanding it.
[00:58:57.796 --> 00:58:59.177]  And I just want them to know that
[00:59:00.814 --> 00:59:03.477]  Yeah, and they brought in people that are actually going to follow those orders.
[00:59:03.497 --> 00:59:06.040]  I was actually very happy during 2020 when most of our police forces
[00:59:17.316 --> 00:59:17.777]  I don't think so.
[00:59:33.865 --> 00:59:36.706]  Yeah, so that's my thoughts on it, but thanks for taking my call.
[00:59:36.766 --> 00:59:37.247]  Hey, great point sir.
[00:59:37.267 --> 00:59:37.867]  Thank you so much.
[00:59:37.887 --> 00:59:39.107]  Let's jam in one more.
[00:59:39.127 --> 00:59:39.928]  Jeff in Missouri, go ahead.
[01:00:01.775 --> 01:00:03.836]  Hey Alex, ex-Army Ranger here.
[01:00:04.396 --> 01:00:09.937]  I want to speak to the gaslighting of the immorality to cause this civil unrest.
[01:00:11.017 --> 01:00:20.239]  For the last 10 years, they've been hardening the heart of the left against the right.
[01:00:20.259 --> 01:00:25.861]  And these people are going to come after us because we're Christian.
[01:00:26.061 --> 01:00:26.541]  Opposed
[01:00:27.085 --> 01:00:32.951]  To us going after them, say, because they are a Muslim or some other ethnicity.
[01:00:34.572 --> 01:00:37.655]  I spent a lot of time in Bosnia, which was a civil war.
[01:00:39.337 --> 01:00:41.899]  And people don't understand what that really means.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:51.629]  When you stand over a mass grave of 300 women, children, it hardens your heart.
[01:00:52.168 --> 01:00:56.251]  That makes you want to do everything you can to stop that from happening here.
[01:00:56.531 --> 01:00:57.732]  I tell you what, Jeff, don't hang up.
[01:00:57.772 --> 01:00:58.352]  I gotta go to break.
[01:00:58.392 --> 01:01:00.354]  Come back and recap your story and then finish your story.
[01:01:00.374 --> 01:01:01.154]  People need to hear this.
[01:01:01.775 --> 01:01:02.355]  We're gonna go to break.
[01:01:02.395 --> 01:01:03.035]  Don't hang up, Jeff.
[01:01:03.055 --> 01:01:07.258]  Then we'll go to Dave and Travis and Chuck and John and Corey and Matt and Jim.
[01:01:07.278 --> 01:01:08.179]  That'll be it for calls.
[01:01:08.719 --> 01:01:10.541]  I got Roger Stone coming up and then I got, um,
[01:01:14.648 --> 01:01:17.532]  Other big guests, Max Keiser coming up today.
[01:01:18.434 --> 01:01:20.256]  And some other surprises as well.
[01:01:20.877 --> 01:01:22.079]  So please stay with us.
[01:01:22.099 --> 01:01:23.341]  But yeah, we're in crazy times.
[01:01:24.002 --> 01:01:25.144]  We're in very dangerous times.
[01:01:25.184 --> 01:01:28.148]  And I want the people trying to start all this to know, better watch it.
[01:01:28.168 --> 01:01:29.630]  Because you're the one starting it.
[01:01:30.635 --> 01:01:33.097]  And you're in a bad position, so knock it off right now.
[01:01:33.697 --> 01:01:34.258]  No one to quit.
[01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:35.519]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:35.539 --> 01:01:35.939]  Stay with us.
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:40.963]  And we are now into our number two broadcasting worldwide.
[01:01:41.644 --> 01:01:42.905]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:01:43.065 --> 01:01:44.526]  Roger Stone's come up with big breaking news.
[01:01:44.566 --> 01:01:48.229]  By the hour, we're taking your phone calls on the Democrat Party operatives and U.N.
[01:01:48.329 --> 01:01:50.871]  operatives all over the news saying martial law, U.N.
[01:01:50.911 --> 01:01:55.655]  troops, NATO troops in America with a new pandemic, civil war to drive Trump from office if he's reelected,
[01:01:56.175 --> 01:01:58.617]  This is crazy what they're saying and what they're doing.
[01:01:58.637 --> 01:02:05.381]  We were talking to Jeff in Missouri, who said he'd been over in Serbia during that whole civil war and saw mass graves.
[01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:10.265]  Tell us why you were there, recap your story, and then give us your take on what's coming.
[01:02:11.465 --> 01:02:16.289]  Well, my mission over there was to take kids to school, to avoid laying mine.
[01:02:17.009 --> 01:02:17.830]  And that's what I did.
[01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:21.032]  But, you know, occasionally we'd have to go out.
[01:02:21.661 --> 01:02:27.966]  And we would find these mass graves, you know, 20, 30, 50 people just shot dead for whatever reason.
[01:02:29.227 --> 01:02:36.873]  And the left has been gaslighting half of America to harden their hearts against the other half of America.
[01:02:37.794 --> 01:02:47.101]  But people don't realize when you pull that trigger and there's a person dead in front of you, you've committed the whole act of immorality.
[01:02:47.761 --> 01:02:49.803]  And that's what the left has been preaching
[01:02:51.543 --> 01:03:08.529]  What do you make of Raskin and all them calling for martial law and civil war, and giggling about it?
[01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:15.231]  They're talking about something so dangerous, so bad, like it's no big deal, and it's because I think they've never probably been in a fistfight.
[01:03:15.271 --> 01:03:18.212]  They've just been in control, so they don't realize how real this is.
[01:03:19.332 --> 01:03:28.821]  Well you can look at Jamie Raskin and know that he would be behind 50 people saying what he's gonna say and send other people out to fight his battle.
[01:03:29.842 --> 01:03:30.803]  He won't get scathed.
[01:03:30.923 --> 01:03:31.703]  He won't get hurt.
[01:03:31.944 --> 01:03:34.606]  It'll be the common Joe on the street that gets hurt.
[01:03:35.447 --> 01:03:43.915]  And be left, I don't care left or right, that's still a dead person and they still have a family and everybody, you know, people they care about.
[01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:49.922]  Well, they're openly planning a civil war and total collapse, and I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:03:49.942 --> 01:03:50.402]  Great points.
[01:03:51.023 --> 01:03:54.003]  Dave in Arizona, you're on the air on Civil War, the left's promoting.
[01:03:54.023 --> 01:03:54.303]  Go ahead.
[01:03:55.384 --> 01:03:56.304]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[01:03:56.364 --> 01:04:00.265]  I have thoughts on Waltz, too, but the civil war thing is way more important.
[01:04:00.285 --> 01:04:01.205]  Go ahead, cover both of them.
[01:04:02.085 --> 01:04:02.805]  Okay, thank you, sir.
[01:04:03.266 --> 01:04:03.926]  I love the show.
[01:04:04.486 --> 01:04:12.908]  So, the sociopathic overlords in our establishment class are trying to stoke up civil war because it's the age-old adage
[01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:19.786]  That if they keep we, the people, divided, we won't train our eyes on them.
[01:04:20.006 --> 01:04:20.327]  Bingo.
[01:04:20.567 --> 01:04:28.091]  Because I'll argue that we've been in a post-constitutional era, not for years, but for decades.
[01:04:28.151 --> 01:04:28.371]  Yes.
[01:04:28.671 --> 01:04:35.635]  And the fact of the matter is, if they can convince us, both sides, and I think the country's 70-30, not 50-50.
[01:04:35.675 --> 01:04:40.778]  No, the globalists are robbing and destroying all of our futures, but if they can divide and conquer us, that's the oldest trick.
[01:04:42.333 --> 01:04:43.054]  Absolutely.
[01:04:43.174 --> 01:04:52.040]  So people don't realize that it's really the people in charge that are doing all of this to us intentionally.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.683]  And that's why they steal our money through taxes and license fees.
[01:04:56.063 --> 01:05:02.668]  If people would sit down and realize that half of what they earn on a daily basis goes to pay somebody else, then what are they doing?
[01:05:02.709 --> 01:05:03.529]  Our roads aren't better.
[01:05:03.549 --> 01:05:05.431]  The bridges aren't better.
[01:05:05.471 --> 01:05:07.212]  I mean, that's proven every day.
[01:05:07.312 --> 01:05:09.793]  Well, yeah, they can issue any amount of money they want since 1913.
[01:05:10.153 --> 01:05:11.154]  It doesn't go to run the country.
[01:05:11.514 --> 01:05:13.595]  It goes to keep little people down.
[01:05:15.616 --> 01:05:16.416]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:05:16.436 --> 01:05:18.017]  It's money laundering 101, sir.
[01:05:18.337 --> 01:05:19.518]  It's exactly what it is.
[01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:36.305]  And if I could mention the thing with Waltz, this scares me because it reminds me, I actually went back and looked at some of my Twix posts from late 2020, that they would put up two Nihilist Marxists on the ticket and they put up an empty vessel in 2020.
[01:05:37.245 --> 01:05:40.227]  That shows me that they know the game is won.
[01:05:40.627 --> 01:05:42.028]  They will count enough votes
[01:05:43.556 --> 01:05:48.120]  For their side to win, because it's Tammany Hall 2024, just like 2020.
[01:05:49.221 --> 01:05:52.504]  It's vote counters that matter, not the votes, nor the voters.
[01:05:52.524 --> 01:05:53.585]  And that's what Stalin said.
[01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:55.227]  I don't care who casts ballots.
[01:05:55.387 --> 01:05:55.787]  I don't care.
[01:05:55.827 --> 01:05:57.309]  Sorry to interrupt you, but you're absolutely right.
[01:05:57.789 --> 01:06:03.574]  This morning I was thinking, to pick Kamala and pick Walls, they're so bad, it shows they think the fix is in.
[01:06:03.594 --> 01:06:03.835]  Go ahead.
[01:06:05.174 --> 01:06:05.534]  Yes, sir.
[01:06:05.875 --> 01:06:06.555]  I think that's it.
[01:06:06.616 --> 01:06:08.117]  That's just the point I'm trying to get through.
[01:06:08.437 --> 01:06:11.060]  Now, we're certainly active out here in State 48.
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:14.443]  We're PC's, the most local of the political party.
[01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:20.349]  We go to rallies, plant seeds, everybody sharing the word with everybody.
[01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:21.550]  We're still active.
[01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:22.271]  We're going to vote.
[01:06:22.351 --> 01:06:23.572]  I'm not being a black pill.
[01:06:23.993 --> 01:06:26.916]  I'm just saying, I think that they've played their hand and they've shown us
[01:06:27.516 --> 01:06:32.920]  And it was evident in 2022 out here in our midterms.
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:40.606]  Three out of five election sites were down on election day because they know Republicans distrust mail-in ballots.
[01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:49.792]  In the Republican areas, they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:06:49.812 --> 01:06:50.152]  Absolutely.
[01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:55.415]  We have to be honest about how bad things are to then raise our awareness and our action to that level.
[01:06:55.855 --> 01:06:56.595]  Great points, sir.
[01:06:56.635 --> 01:06:57.276]  Thank you so much.
[01:06:57.316 --> 01:07:02.738]  Since you mentioned Kamala and Tim Walz, here's a couple clips.
[01:07:03.139 --> 01:07:04.519]  Here's the first clip that Elon's saying.
[01:07:04.559 --> 01:07:05.220]  She's a communist.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.481]  This is classic communism is what she's saying.
[01:07:07.861 --> 01:07:11.083]  And then here's Walz saying, hey, socialism is just being a good neighbor.
[01:07:11.123 --> 01:07:11.443]  Here it is.
[01:07:12.304 --> 01:07:15.565]  It has to be about a goal of saying everybody should end up in the same place.
[01:07:15.845 --> 01:07:19.166]  And since we didn't start in the same place, some folks might need more.
[01:07:20.046 --> 01:07:21.346]  Equitable distribution.
[01:07:22.486 --> 01:07:24.747]  Giving resources based on equity.
[01:07:24.807 --> 01:07:28.608]  Understanding that we fight for equality, but we also need to fight for equity.
[01:07:28.648 --> 01:07:31.009]  Understanding not everyone starts out at the same place.
[01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:34.449]  So there's a big difference between equality and equity.
[01:07:36.270 --> 01:07:40.991]  Equality suggests often everybody should get the same thing.
[01:07:42.762 --> 01:07:46.125]  Well, that often assumes everybody started out in the same place.
[01:07:47.786 --> 01:07:51.929]  As opposed to equity, which is everyone should end up in the same place.
[01:07:53.331 --> 01:07:58.175]  And if you then understand not everybody started out in the same place, you understand some people need more.
[01:08:00.016 --> 01:08:01.677]  So we all end up in the same place.
[01:08:02.418 --> 01:08:03.099]  Right?
[01:08:04.259 --> 01:08:08.143]  We are proud of the fact that equity is one of our guiding principles.
[01:08:09.164 --> 01:08:15.108]  Proud of the fact that we understand equality is important, but not everybody starts out on the same base.
[01:08:15.988 --> 01:08:21.892]  We see that people in our country are having an experience that is not equal.
[01:08:24.074 --> 01:08:36.802]  So when we talk about the work we are doing here together, it is recognizing that and being guided by this principle of what we must do in the spirit and in the interest of equity.
[01:08:38.635 --> 01:08:45.161]  To put equity firmly at the center of our economic policy.
[01:08:46.162 --> 01:09:03.298]  But no, if you look at the reality of who will benefit from certain policies, when you take into account that they're not starting at the same place and they're not starting on equal footing, it will directly benefit black children, black families, black homeowners.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.240]  I think we need to push back on this.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:11.062]  There's no guarantee to free speech on misinformation or hate speech, and especially around our democracy.
[01:09:11.502 --> 01:09:12.502]  But we can get out there.
[01:09:12.782 --> 01:09:13.262]  Reach out.
[01:09:13.502 --> 01:09:14.023]  Make the case.
[01:09:14.303 --> 01:09:17.903]  And for one thing, don't ever shy away from our progressive values.
[01:09:18.524 --> 01:09:21.044]  One person's socialism is another person's neighborliness.
[01:09:21.464 --> 01:09:23.205]  Classic communist takeover.
[01:09:33.186 --> 01:09:37.611]  Cut off the resources, and then tell people you're gonna give them free stuff, and they just burn everything down.
[01:09:38.572 --> 01:09:39.252]  Give your comments.
[01:09:39.272 --> 01:09:41.455]  Socialism is just being a good neighbor.
[01:09:56.917 --> 01:09:58.177]  Would you be mine?
[01:09:58.338 --> 01:09:59.438]  Could you be mine?
[01:09:59.698 --> 01:10:01.839]  Won't you be my neighbor?
[01:10:01.879 --> 01:10:05.480]  They're getting ready to turn all this loose.
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:06.600]  2020 was just a beta test.
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:11.162]  Please, won't you be my neighbor?
[01:10:11.222 --> 01:10:12.603]  And that's why they put Tim Walz in.
[01:10:14.263 --> 01:10:18.945]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:10:19.065 --> 01:10:21.065]  Travis in Utah on civil unrest.
[01:10:21.086 --> 01:10:21.906]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:10:23.306 --> 01:10:24.387]  Yeah, hi Alex, how you doing?
[01:10:24.667 --> 01:10:25.247]  I'm alright, brother.
[01:10:26.141 --> 01:10:26.521]  You hear me?
[01:10:26.561 --> 01:10:27.141]  Okay, alright.
[01:10:27.661 --> 01:10:29.502]  Oh boy, this triggers me, I'll tell you what.
[01:10:30.122 --> 01:10:31.342]  You guys are right on point.
[01:10:32.402 --> 01:10:37.984]  This goes back, I used to pay attention to Bogradz back in the 80s, talking about the UN and stuff like that.
[01:10:38.184 --> 01:10:40.364]  And the first time I ever voted was for him.
[01:10:41.025 --> 01:10:43.305]  Anyway, that's been a major question in my mind.
[01:10:43.785 --> 01:10:44.325]  What do we do?
[01:10:44.405 --> 01:10:45.506]  Because they want to divide us.
[01:10:45.926 --> 01:10:47.206]  They want us to fight each other.
[01:10:47.797 --> 01:10:52.842]  And it's like the only answer I have to this topic is I think it's dynamic.
[01:10:52.882 --> 01:10:56.486]  We've got to, like, react defensively as things roll out.
[01:10:56.886 --> 01:11:01.391]  And we've just got to help each other and be there and team up with neighbors and family and friends.
[01:11:01.451 --> 01:11:02.852]  And, you know, prepping's done.
[01:11:03.193 --> 01:11:05.054]  I'm there, but I'm too old for this.
[01:11:05.114 --> 01:11:06.316]  I thought it was coming sooner.
[01:11:06.356 --> 01:11:08.057]  So I'm ready to help others around me.
[01:11:08.538 --> 01:11:09.859]  And so, you know, what do you do?
[01:11:09.879 --> 01:11:11.481]  Because they're going to bring it to our door.
[01:11:12.065 --> 01:11:15.226]  You know, they're going to bring the fight to us, eventually.
[01:11:15.706 --> 01:11:19.948]  And best, my opinion and advice is, I mean, how do you avoid the fray?
[01:11:19.968 --> 01:11:21.329]  Don't get pulled into their fight.
[01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:22.609]  That's when they get us.
[01:11:22.749 --> 01:11:25.851]  We get pulled into when they want us to react, we lose.
[01:11:25.991 --> 01:11:26.911]  No, I agree.
[01:11:27.011 --> 01:11:34.414]  And they've told us they're planning a civil war, civil unrest, racial division, and new viruses, which are already rolling out.
[01:11:34.474 --> 01:11:35.515]  So what do we do?
[01:11:35.555 --> 01:11:36.255]  We expose it?
[01:11:37.137 --> 01:11:38.997]  But we need to see Trump talking about it.
[01:11:39.057 --> 01:11:39.838]  He is starting to.
[01:11:39.858 --> 01:11:42.538]  This is serious, folks.
[01:11:42.578 --> 01:11:45.119]  Because we're sitting here like we're in a normal election.
[01:11:45.179 --> 01:11:48.159]  No, they've told us, they've telegraphed what their plans are.
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:50.760]  That's exactly right.
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:53.260]  I've known this since I was a little kid.
[01:11:53.921 --> 01:11:54.881]  I called in and talked to you.
[01:11:54.901 --> 01:11:58.301]  My grandma, Reva, you said a prayer for her on 9-1-1 time.
[01:11:58.962 --> 01:11:59.802]  She woke me up.
[01:12:01.545 --> 01:12:05.169]  None dare call a conspiracy book and fightin' the fluoride and all that stuff.
[01:12:05.229 --> 01:12:08.813]  And, you know, I just had to call in today because this is the second part of the equation.
[01:12:09.354 --> 01:12:10.335]  You know, we, uh...
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.061]  I just, I know it's coming.
[01:12:13.241 --> 01:12:15.583]  I can't prove it, and people think I'm nuts.
[01:12:15.723 --> 01:12:16.984]  Well, you can't prove it.
[01:12:17.004 --> 01:12:17.724]  God bless you, brother.
[01:12:17.984 --> 01:12:19.565]  They're out in the open saying they're doing it.
[01:12:19.805 --> 01:12:20.346]  Thanks for the call.
[01:12:20.866 --> 01:12:21.927]  Matt in North Carolina.
[01:12:22.027 --> 01:12:22.227]  U.N.
[01:12:22.267 --> 01:12:23.688]  takeover coming, bird flu pandemic.
[01:12:24.028 --> 01:12:26.170]  By the way, if you just joined us, the U.N.
[01:12:26.190 --> 01:12:32.594]  spokespersons, I've got not just hotels, I've got a bunch of clubs saying, the pandemic's here, new global lockdowns, they're going to try it again.
[01:12:33.194 --> 01:12:35.536]  I've got like seven clips of the U.N.
[01:12:36.236 --> 01:12:37.797]  So, I mean, this is going on.
[01:12:37.837 --> 01:12:38.157]  Go ahead.
[01:12:38.498 --> 01:12:39.058]  Go ahead, Matt.
[01:12:40.188 --> 01:12:40.929]  Yep, yep.
[01:12:41.049 --> 01:12:41.649]  Hi, Alex.
[01:12:41.869 --> 01:12:42.970]  Thanks for all you do.
[01:12:44.191 --> 01:12:51.196]  Yeah, I mean, I feel like I'm parroting a lot of callers that just called in, but to me, it is about the signal.
[01:12:51.256 --> 01:12:52.557]  What is the signal?
[01:12:52.697 --> 01:12:54.498]  What is the truthful signal that's going out?
[01:12:54.618 --> 01:12:57.761]  And it just seems to be dynamic, always changing.
[01:12:57.781 --> 01:13:07.128]  I appreciate your analysis, and I even listen to this show just to get the signal as I listen to this show, although it's filtered and there's less noise around it.
[01:13:07.768 --> 01:13:08.909]  So I really appreciate that.
[01:13:09.854 --> 01:13:26.946]  But on the mask issue, I feel the whole mask pushing is just about, at the very least, just to perpetrate more fraud during the election coming up so that those doing that have a hidden identity, at its very least.
[01:13:27.026 --> 01:13:29.067]  And if they can go beyond that, they will.
[01:13:30.808 --> 01:13:35.851]  And so I appreciate that signal coming out of this conversation.
[01:13:38.059 --> 01:13:41.421]  It all goes back to just seems like the fog of war, right?
[01:13:41.661 --> 01:13:47.043]  And just pushing all the way to UN boots on the ground in the U.S.
[01:13:47.263 --> 01:13:48.984]  is just an unthinkable thing.
[01:13:50.884 --> 01:13:54.366]  But when it comes to feeling like, you know, what can I do?
[01:13:54.426 --> 01:13:55.266]  What can I say?
[01:13:55.366 --> 01:14:02.209]  What can I, you know, more people I talk to, I mean, going even a couple years back, I said, do you know who Alex Jones is?
[01:14:02.989 --> 01:14:04.590]  They'd look at me and, no, who's that?
[01:14:05.865 --> 01:14:06.827]  We're good to go.
[01:14:20.159 --> 01:14:21.320]  Well, let me add something to that.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.382]  It's not about me, but I'm a public figure that's known.
[01:14:24.742 --> 01:14:28.084]  So if I'm only getting love, or 99% love now, that shows we're winning.
[01:14:28.104 --> 01:14:32.947]  Separate from the globalist propaganda that we're losing, no, we are winning, because you're absolutely right.
[01:14:33.047 --> 01:14:34.468]  People are really starting to get it.
[01:14:34.528 --> 01:14:36.609]  Larger and larger portions of people.
[01:14:36.989 --> 01:14:38.510]  That's why the globalists are so desperate.
[01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:39.290]  They're going to go for broke.
[01:14:41.191 --> 01:14:41.412]  Yes.
[01:14:42.192 --> 01:14:42.852]  Yeah.
[01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:47.235]  When I talk to like-minded folks, we get into subjects of
[01:14:48.004 --> 01:14:58.486]  Of what to do, what to say, and there's this feeling of being paralyzed and being neutered to speak out at work with friends, even with my wife.
[01:14:58.666 --> 01:15:08.708]  My wife doesn't want me to talk about it, and I need to keep her anxiety level down, but I can take on a lot more anxiety or these type of thoughts than I think she can.
[01:15:08.748 --> 01:15:11.829]  So it's just so tempered, and then
[01:15:12.659 --> 01:15:15.441]  Well that's the problem is, I get it.
[01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:17.583]  People don't want to admit this and I appreciate your call.
[01:15:17.983 --> 01:15:19.744]  People don't want to admit this is happening.
[01:15:20.065 --> 01:15:20.725]  And I get that.
[01:15:20.805 --> 01:15:21.406]  But it is.
[01:15:21.446 --> 01:15:22.226]  So we have to admit it.
[01:15:22.266 --> 01:15:22.607]  Thank you.
[01:15:23.928 --> 01:15:27.290]  And your wife, I understand she doesn't want to believe this stuff because it's scary.
[01:15:27.810 --> 01:15:30.252]  But it still doesn't mean that it's not happening.
[01:15:30.532 --> 01:15:31.033]  It is happening.
[01:15:31.573 --> 01:15:34.556]  Jim in North Carolina on unlawful orders on Americans.
[01:15:34.596 --> 01:15:34.856]  Go ahead.
[01:15:36.448 --> 01:15:37.529]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:40.353]  I just, you know, a little bone to pick with you here.
[01:15:40.513 --> 01:15:41.815]  I want to ask you a question.
[01:15:41.855 --> 01:15:43.397]  Qualify this for us if you could.
[01:15:43.477 --> 01:15:45.640]  You keep saying legal and lawful all the time.
[01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:46.361]  Legal and lawful.
[01:15:46.401 --> 01:15:47.142]  Legal and lawful.
[01:15:47.202 --> 01:15:49.305]  Is the Declaration of Independence legal and lawful?
[01:15:51.255 --> 01:15:54.518]  Oh, there is a right to revolt in the Declaration of Independence.
[01:15:54.598 --> 01:15:56.219]  It doesn't give us the right, it just points it out.
[01:15:56.819 --> 01:15:59.782]  You've got places like New Hampshire that have a right to revolt in their constitution.
[01:16:00.482 --> 01:16:05.566]  And I'm not saying people don't have a right to do whatever they think is right at this point because they're such a criminal government.
[01:16:05.686 --> 01:16:08.749]  I'm saying they want violence because they're going to pre-program that.
[01:16:08.769 --> 01:16:10.690]  They're going to have violence either way, Alex.
[01:16:10.810 --> 01:16:12.031]  They're coming either way.
[01:16:12.091 --> 01:16:12.852]  See, that's the point.
[01:16:13.272 --> 01:16:15.274]  They're coming either way, and you freaking know that.
[01:16:15.574 --> 01:16:16.214]  They're coming either way.
[01:16:16.234 --> 01:16:16.995]  Well, let me just stop you.
[01:16:17.235 --> 01:16:18.937]  Hey, hey, hey, you're the big man.
[01:16:19.637 --> 01:16:21.237]  So, you're the general.
[01:16:21.317 --> 01:16:21.677]  What do we do?
[01:16:21.697 --> 01:16:22.618]  Who do we go kill today?
[01:16:23.178 --> 01:16:24.718]  Because I'm a wimp.
[01:16:24.818 --> 01:16:31.240]  I'm just up here under total globalist attack, putting my whole family and life on the line, trying to expose the enemy, trying to stop it, having huge effects here.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:34.360]  And then you call in and say, hey, Jones, you're being a wimp.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:35.680]  It's time for violence.
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.061]  It's in the Declaration of Independence.
[01:16:37.101 --> 01:16:39.941]  So you're going to go out and kill some people today?
[01:16:40.001 --> 01:16:40.802]  Who are you going to kill?
[01:16:46.203 --> 01:16:47.143]  Oh, Cricket's right there.
[01:16:48.868 --> 01:16:49.448]  Yeah, he's gone.
[01:16:49.668 --> 01:16:50.189]  He hung up.
[01:16:50.489 --> 01:16:51.149]  I didn't hang up on him.
[01:16:52.270 --> 01:17:01.836]  Man, these guys I see online, nobody knows who they are, they got some avatar up, and they call into the show, and they say, hey man, you're a wimp.
[01:17:01.956 --> 01:17:02.936]  We need violence.
[01:17:03.056 --> 01:17:04.637]  I'm like, hey, you're in charge, buddy.
[01:17:05.338 --> 01:17:06.238]  Who we go kill today?
[01:17:07.359 --> 01:17:08.600]  And I'm not saying do what he says.
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.661]  My point is, is that
[01:17:14.005 --> 01:17:19.450]  I mean, if somebody went and blew up the Democrat Party headquarters in Austin, Texas today, God forbid, that would make them victims.
[01:17:20.190 --> 01:17:22.192]  Don't worry, when this all goes down, they're going to do it to themselves.
[01:17:23.113 --> 01:17:26.515]  So we've got to expose their tactics and that they're the bad guys ahead of time.
[01:17:29.097 --> 01:17:30.759]  So, I want to ask you a question, Jones.
[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:35.202]  You know, we've got a right to get violent, and I'm like, okay, you're in charge, buddy.
[01:17:35.322 --> 01:17:36.303]  You're in charge, right now.
[01:17:37.364 --> 01:17:38.505]  You tell us what we're supposed to do.
[01:17:38.585 --> 01:17:40.547]  Oh, crickets, crickets, crickets, crickets.
[01:17:41.576 --> 01:17:45.600]  All the people shooting their mouths off about violence all day, they sure as hell aren't going out and doing it.
[01:17:48.582 --> 01:17:49.924]  People have to be awake first.
[01:17:49.944 --> 01:17:52.606]  They have to know who the bad guys are.
[01:17:52.646 --> 01:17:53.667]  We want to avoid violence.
[01:17:54.948 --> 01:17:56.469]  What do you think this show's doing over the years?
[01:17:56.489 --> 01:17:57.931]  Why do you think they want it off air?
[01:17:58.371 --> 01:18:00.673]  We're identifying the globals, their operations, and their tricks.
[01:18:01.274 --> 01:18:02.515]  So if it does go to war,
[01:18:04.019 --> 01:18:05.020]  We got a good chance to win it.
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:07.241]  But I'm trying to avoid that.
[01:18:07.821 --> 01:18:09.943]  Just like on January 6th, I tried to stop people going in the building.
[01:18:10.143 --> 01:18:11.243]  And I did stop a lot going in.
[01:18:12.084 --> 01:18:13.545]  And my reward was them trying to put me in prison.
[01:18:13.865 --> 01:18:14.505]  It's okay, though.
[01:18:14.585 --> 01:18:16.847]  I can stand before God and know I did the right thing.
[01:18:16.867 --> 01:18:22.350]  So there's a lot of Monday morning quarterbacks out there, folks.
[01:18:25.752 --> 01:18:30.095]  Who are mad at me because I'm not saying, attack this, attack that.
[01:18:31.721 --> 01:18:34.142]  I already said, if they want a civil war, who's calling for it?
[01:18:34.162 --> 01:18:34.723]  Who's behind it?
[01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:36.583]  They're the ones that are the real enemies.
[01:18:36.603 --> 01:18:40.305]  I mean, right there's the answer to all of this.
[01:18:40.746 --> 01:18:44.908]  We need to expose them so they know not to do it, and let them know they'll be held accountable.
[01:18:45.848 --> 01:18:48.309]  They're trying to threaten us, we need to let them know we're what they're doing.
[01:18:48.329 --> 01:18:49.890]  It's real simple what I just said.
[01:18:51.271 --> 01:18:52.211]  And I'm mad at the caller.
[01:18:53.532 --> 01:18:55.853]  You called me out, I called you out, you hung up.
[01:18:56.994 --> 01:18:58.535]  You're not willing to have an argument with me?
[01:18:58.655 --> 01:19:00.996]  But you're gonna lead us in armed conflict?
[01:19:01.883 --> 01:19:02.163]  Okay.
[01:19:03.244 --> 01:19:04.885]  My name is Alexander Emmerich Jones, man.
[01:19:04.905 --> 01:19:05.766]  I've been on here 30 years.
[01:19:05.846 --> 01:19:06.747]  I am who I say I am.
[01:19:07.247 --> 01:19:08.408]  I believe every damn thing I say.
[01:19:08.768 --> 01:19:10.129]  I'm wrong sometimes, but not most of the time.
[01:19:10.649 --> 01:19:13.451]  And if you think violence is the answer at this point, you're wrong.
[01:19:15.413 --> 01:19:17.274]  Now they start trying to round us up, put us in FEMA camps.
[01:19:17.474 --> 01:19:18.235]  Katie, bar the door.
[01:19:18.295 --> 01:19:19.055]  It's off the races.
[01:19:20.957 --> 01:19:24.839]  So have you discussed in your civil war who your targets are?
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:25.760]  See?
[01:19:29.543 --> 01:19:30.463]  Cory in Missouri.
[01:19:30.483 --> 01:19:30.984]  You're on the air.
[01:19:31.024 --> 01:19:31.284]  Go ahead.
[01:19:34.113 --> 01:19:35.313]  Hey, what's going on?
[01:19:35.333 --> 01:19:35.814]  Can you hear me?
[01:19:35.894 --> 01:19:36.074]  Good.
[01:19:36.114 --> 01:19:36.754]  Live show, sir.
[01:19:36.774 --> 01:19:37.014]  Go ahead.
[01:19:37.054 --> 01:19:37.594]  You want to comment?
[01:19:38.814 --> 01:19:41.135]  Yeah, so I'm glad you actually came in at this time.
[01:19:41.215 --> 01:19:47.417]  So, yeah, we need to identify exactly in our state who is causing these issues.
[01:19:47.457 --> 01:19:50.338]  So there's a scripture that's Proverbs 21, 12.
[01:19:50.678 --> 01:19:59.660]  It says the righteous one takes note of the house of the wicked and brings the wicked to ruin.
[01:20:00.361 --> 01:20:01.221]  We need to take note.
[01:20:02.193 --> 01:20:03.634]  of the House of the Wicked.
[01:20:03.654 --> 01:20:08.278]  See, the wicked lie in wait, it says, to lay ambush to the righteous.
[01:20:08.658 --> 01:20:12.181]  They lie and see how they can attack us and overthrow us.
[01:20:12.621 --> 01:20:18.866]  We need to take note of who exactly wants this civil war, who is provoking it.
[01:20:19.366 --> 01:20:22.409]  Literally, guys, like, grab a piece of paper and a pen and take notes.
[01:20:22.969 --> 01:20:23.850]  Bible says take notes.
[01:20:24.450 --> 01:20:30.315]  And if we can turn our spiritual attention, our intention towards
[01:20:31.181 --> 01:20:41.374]  Those in charge of this, right now, turn our spiritual eyes to them, we can all unite, and just look at them in the spirit, about to walk in the spirit, look at them, and we have to freak the devil out.
[01:20:41.414 --> 01:20:45.079]  We have to realize these are demons in these people taunting us.
[01:20:46.192 --> 01:20:51.474]  We have to realize that the Bible says we have authority over all the powers of the devil.
[01:20:51.554 --> 01:20:52.894]  Nothing shall by any means hurt us.
[01:20:52.975 --> 01:20:53.495]  Absolutely.
[01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:55.115]  So let me ask you this and you can elaborate.
[01:20:55.455 --> 01:20:56.476]  What do you make of that caller?
[01:20:56.556 --> 01:21:01.718]  Maybe he's a fed, probably not, calling in trying to get me to call for violence or I'm not a tough guy.
[01:21:02.318 --> 01:21:04.119]  But then when I told him, okay, what do we do?
[01:21:04.139 --> 01:21:04.959]  He didn't want to talk, did he?
[01:21:06.263 --> 01:21:09.445]  Yeah, I think he's not realizing this is a spiritual thing first.
[01:21:09.465 --> 01:21:17.451]  You got to stop it spiritually or else, yeah, the devil loves men to get so mad at men that they fight each other and kill each other and step back and laugh.
[01:21:17.911 --> 01:21:20.753]  I was in Nicaragua during the Civil War in 2018.
[01:21:20.813 --> 01:21:22.934]  I've been there 10 years and I saw it.
[01:21:23.535 --> 01:21:28.578]  And if you could stop it spiritually first, it's much better because the devil wins when we all kill each other.
[01:21:29.039 --> 01:21:33.742]  But if we can identify who the devil is using, take notes, let them know we're watching them.
[01:21:34.358 --> 01:21:34.598]  Right?
[01:21:34.678 --> 01:21:37.160]  Hit him up on X, like, hey, we see what you're doing.
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:39.542]  And just put, tag that scripture.
[01:21:40.082 --> 01:21:40.462]  Proverbs 21, 12.
[01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:42.644]  We're watching.
[01:21:42.964 --> 01:21:44.966]  I mean, Luke 10, last thing real quick.
[01:21:45.346 --> 01:21:51.110]  It says, I have given you, verse 18, he replied, I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
[01:21:51.170 --> 01:21:56.374]  I've given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and overcome all the power of the enemy.
[01:21:57.014 --> 01:21:57.855]  Nothing will harm you.
[01:21:58.359 --> 01:22:03.904]  We've got to realize we're not victims of these people, we're victors over the demons, and they're subject to it.
[01:22:03.964 --> 01:22:04.564]  That's right.
[01:22:04.645 --> 01:22:08.068]  They return and say, even the demons are subject to it.
[01:22:08.288 --> 01:22:16.195]  I forget the exact verse, but the Spirit of God does not give us over to fear and cowardice, but a spirit of overcoming.
[01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:17.736]  Correct.
[01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:21.029]  I'm not trying to be mad at the guy.
[01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:23.910]  I've had that call a thousand times in 30 years.
[01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:25.611]  Hey, you're a wimp.
[01:22:25.651 --> 01:22:27.592]  We need to call for violence.
[01:22:27.692 --> 01:22:28.492]  And it's like, really?
[01:22:28.892 --> 01:22:29.693]  Where does that start?
[01:22:29.753 --> 01:22:30.373]  Who does that?
[01:22:31.233 --> 01:22:35.075]  Like, okay, they're coming down the road with army vehicles, rounding us up, taking us to camps.
[01:22:35.655 --> 01:22:36.696]  Sorry, tried to fix it.
[01:22:36.816 --> 01:22:37.436]  Sorry for them.
[01:22:37.957 --> 01:22:38.637]  We are where we're at.
[01:22:39.137 --> 01:22:40.878]  I'm trying to stop that ahead of time.
[01:22:43.482 --> 01:22:48.226]  Literally, guys, I'm telling you, I've lived through crazy spiritual battles in Central America.
[01:22:48.246 --> 01:22:57.235]  Write a list down of the names of the people that you know that are wicked, bring it to God, pray to God, and say, let the wicked fall into their own traps.
[01:22:57.975 --> 01:22:58.896]  Pray that it works.
[01:22:58.976 --> 01:22:59.557]  I've seen it.
[01:22:59.577 --> 01:23:01.018]  Alright, thank you, Corey.
[01:23:01.118 --> 01:23:01.699]  I gotta jump.
[01:23:02.159 --> 01:23:02.880]  Great, great points.
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:03.841]  Look, here's the deal.
[01:23:05.253 --> 01:23:08.694]  The globalists want violence because they're losing every day.
[01:23:09.414 --> 01:23:10.574]  All over the world, not just here.
[01:23:11.394 --> 01:23:14.115]  So we don't want violence because that's what they want.
[01:23:14.775 --> 01:23:18.095]  And they're gonna try to create an atmosphere that forces us into that.
[01:23:21.116 --> 01:23:25.116]  And then I see the commenters, you know, when's Jones gonna be a man and call for violence?
[01:23:25.176 --> 01:23:27.117]  Well, they're not doing it, because they're probably a fed.
[01:23:27.137 --> 01:23:29.777]  Not saying that last caller was, but maybe.
[01:23:31.777 --> 01:23:34.458]  But as soon as the shoe's put back, okay, what do we do then?
[01:23:35.854 --> 01:23:37.576]  See, I'm supposed to call to the violence.
[01:23:38.918 --> 01:23:45.106]  And if I literally thought there was one person we could go after, like it was Hitler, and we could stop all this, I would do that.
[01:23:45.507 --> 01:23:45.967]  But it's not.
[01:23:46.007 --> 01:23:46.888]  It's a bureaucracy.
[01:23:46.928 --> 01:23:47.790]  It's a corrupt system.
[01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:50.053]  It is spiritual, as the last caller said.
[01:23:50.493 --> 01:23:51.955]  All right, John and Chuck, I'll get to you after.
[01:23:51.995 --> 01:23:53.817]  Roger Stone, if you want to hold, if not, you can hang up.
[01:23:54.554 --> 01:23:55.375]  We got some calls in.
[01:23:55.395 --> 01:23:55.915]  That was good.
[01:23:55.995 --> 01:23:56.535]  Very interesting.
[01:23:56.575 --> 01:23:57.156]  Very informative.
[01:23:57.176 --> 01:23:57.896]  Very thought-provoking.
[01:23:58.456 --> 01:23:59.037]  We're going to go to break.

[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.164]  Only at InfowarsStore.com
[01:25:15.524 --> 01:25:26.568]  And former chief political advisor to President Trump, longtime 45-plus year confidant, Roger Stone joins us with only 89 days left, the most historic election in world history.
[01:25:27.248 --> 01:25:32.110]  We have the left rasking of Congress, others saying we want martial law, we want civil war.
[01:25:33.210 --> 01:25:36.071]  We have Peter Hotez saying we want UN troops in America.
[01:25:36.091 --> 01:25:38.032]  I mean, these people are desperate, they are crazy.
[01:25:38.472 --> 01:25:44.314]  And we got Tim Walz, as Roger was saying during the break, as we connected, a treasure trove of disaster.
[01:25:45.114 --> 01:25:51.958]  Not just wanting to chop little kids' penises off and little girls' breasts off, not just supporting defunding police and Black Lives Matter burning down half of Minnesota.
[01:25:52.478 --> 01:25:55.399]  His wife's saying she loves the smell of burning tires opening the windows up.
[01:25:55.739 --> 01:25:57.180]  We've got him attacking free speech.
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.081]  We've got him endorsing socialism.
[01:25:59.561 --> 01:26:01.903]  I mean, this guy is a train wreck.
[01:26:02.403 --> 01:26:04.684]  The article's on Infowars.com with a full interview.
[01:26:04.724 --> 01:26:08.506]  Tim Walz, no right to free speech if government deems misinformation or hate speech.
[01:26:08.806 --> 01:26:11.948]  So if they define it, just like the EU, you don't have it.
[01:26:11.968 --> 01:26:12.428]  Here's the clip.
[01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:19.052]  There's no guarantee to free speech on misinformation or hate speech and especially around our democracy.
[01:26:19.633 --> 01:26:21.074]  I think we need to push back on this.
[01:26:21.114 --> 01:26:26.898]  There's no guarantee to free speech on misinformation or hate speech and especially around our democracy.
[01:26:27.478 --> 01:26:28.919]  I think we need to push back on this.
[01:26:28.959 --> 01:26:29.940]  There's no guarantee.
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:32.722]  Yeah, so this guy, this guy is incredible.
[01:26:33.223 --> 01:26:35.944]  You were the first to predict he would be the guy three weeks ago.
[01:26:36.545 --> 01:26:37.345]  Now he is.
[01:26:38.326 --> 01:26:45.595]  I mean, there's tampon Tim, you know, passing laws, but tampons and men's bathrooms in the high schools and places.
[01:26:46.356 --> 01:26:48.598]  I mean, this guy is a real kook.
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:51.422]  Why do you think they chose him?
[01:26:51.642 --> 01:26:52.263]  Where is this going?
[01:26:53.666 --> 01:26:55.607]  Well, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[01:26:55.647 --> 01:26:56.788]  He's he's a weirdo.
[01:26:56.848 --> 01:26:58.349]  That's absolutely clear.
[01:26:58.789 --> 01:27:02.712]  I think he was selected kind of as the least of all evils.
[01:27:02.792 --> 01:27:13.299]  In other words, initially, even I predicted that Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro would be the obvious candidate, Pennsylvania being a crucial swing state.
[01:27:13.679 --> 01:27:23.446]  But then Barack Obama put heavy pressure on Kamala Harris and her advisers not to take Shapiro because he believed it would lose them.
[01:27:23.926 --> 01:27:32.512]  Minnesota and Michigan, where you have very, very large Muslim American populations that are very influential in the Democrat Party.
[01:27:33.413 --> 01:27:52.746]  Then, of course, the candidacy of Mark Kelly, the former astronaut imploded when it was learned that he's actually in a partnership with a communist Chinese company that makes the satellite surveillance balloons that were used to spy on the United States.
[01:27:53.226 --> 01:27:54.327]  It's kind of the end of him.
[01:27:54.747 --> 01:28:00.272]  So the last man standing turned out to be Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.
[01:28:00.372 --> 01:28:08.218]  But the deeper you dig into his background, this is a veritable treasure trove of insanity.
[01:28:08.238 --> 01:28:11.100]  The thing that bothers me the most is really twofold.
[01:28:11.621 --> 01:28:15.864]  He's used his military service as a credential to get elected.
[01:28:16.384 --> 01:28:17.085]  But as J.D.
[01:28:17.165 --> 01:28:24.191]  Vance pointed out this morning, when his unit was called up to go to Iraq, well, he dropped out.
[01:28:24.871 --> 01:28:26.673]  So he evaded his service.
[01:28:27.373 --> 01:28:29.935]  Yet he continues to wear it on his sleeve.
[01:28:30.416 --> 01:28:38.042]  And then secondarily, the three-day delay between the time that the mayor of Minneapolis asked
[01:28:38.402 --> 01:28:40.324]  Thank you very much.
[01:28:54.318 --> 01:28:58.882]  Burning, looting, mayhem, carnage, violence against people.
[01:28:59.562 --> 01:29:07.929]  And then he blames the mayor for the three-day delay, even though it's not the mayor who had the authority to call out the National Guard.
[01:29:07.969 --> 01:29:10.952]  It was the sole authority of the governor.
[01:29:13.095 --> 01:29:15.237]  And just the stolen valor thing.
[01:29:15.277 --> 01:29:17.619]  I'm not a military expert, but I've talked to a lot of people that were involved.
[01:29:17.999 --> 01:29:24.144]  To resign his commission right when we went to war is one of the purest forms of cowardice.
[01:29:24.324 --> 01:29:28.067]  Everything about this guy is spectacularly disgusting.
[01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:35.173]  I think it is potentially a drag on the ticket.
[01:29:35.233 --> 01:29:42.497]  Now, traditionally, as you know, Alex, the selection of a vice presidential candidate has rarely actually mattered.
[01:29:43.918 --> 01:29:47.780]  And in the old days, of course, there was an effort to balance the ticket.
[01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:51.262]  Lyndon Johnson, thought to be a more moderate Democrat, takes
[01:29:51.602 --> 01:29:51.722]  Yeah.
[01:30:10.891 --> 01:30:14.834]  Well that's right, and Elon just came out and called her a communist.
[01:30:14.954 --> 01:30:15.594]  That's what she is.
[01:30:23.359 --> 01:30:28.482]  Well, Walsh is at a minimum, he's woke to the nth degree.
[01:30:29.023 --> 01:30:34.226]  He refuses to even acknowledge that there's a crisis at our southern border, for example.
[01:30:35.046 --> 01:30:45.613]  He says that people are insane when they got upset that Target was partnering with a satanic designer to promote trans products for children.
[01:30:45.633 --> 01:30:46.734]  And as you point out,
[01:30:47.558 --> 01:30:58.567]  Insisting on having tampon dispensers in the men's room in Minnesota, as well as in the public schools, in the boys' rooms.
[01:30:59.167 --> 01:31:00.988]  That's insanity, is what that is.
[01:31:01.589 --> 01:31:01.849]  It is.
[01:31:01.929 --> 01:31:04.711]  And since you mentioned it, here's the new Trump ad dealing with that.
[01:31:04.731 --> 01:31:05.812]  They have the nerve to call J.D.
[01:31:05.892 --> 01:31:06.453]  Vance weird.
[01:31:06.493 --> 01:31:06.773]  Here it is.
[01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:14.638]  What could be weirder than signing a bill into law that requires schools to stock tampons in boys' bathrooms?
[01:31:15.419 --> 01:31:20.945]  Or weirder than signing legislation allowing minors to receive sex change operations?
[01:31:21.706 --> 01:31:26.711]  Try electing the man who signed those bills, Vice President of the United States.
[01:31:27.492 --> 01:31:30.195]  Enter Chief Weirdo Tim Walz.
[01:31:30.835 --> 01:31:41.025]  As Governor of Minnesota, Walz supported legislation that endangers minors, hurts women, and puts radical ideology ahead of common sense.
[01:31:41.665 --> 01:31:46.150]  Now Kamala wants Walz to enforce those laws on a national scale.
[01:31:47.231 --> 01:31:47.971]  Tim Walz.
[01:31:48.352 --> 01:31:49.092]  Too Weird.
[01:31:49.393 --> 01:31:50.233]  Too Radical.
[01:31:51.368 --> 01:31:54.670]  Roger, before we get your take on this, here's the Raw clip.
[01:31:54.690 --> 01:31:57.171]  We played with Mr. Rogers' music earlier, but I want to play it Raw.
[01:31:57.892 --> 01:32:00.373]  Here he is saying, to be a good neighbor is to be socialist.
[01:32:00.393 --> 01:32:01.834]  Here it is.
[01:32:01.994 --> 01:32:03.875]  Don't ever shy away from our progressive values.
[01:32:04.475 --> 01:32:07.017]  One person's socialism is another person's neighborliness.
[01:32:07.257 --> 01:32:09.738]  Just do the damn work.
[01:32:09.878 --> 01:32:11.759]  Don't ever shy away from our progressive values.
[01:32:12.359 --> 01:32:14.901]  One person's socialism is another person's neighborliness.
[01:32:15.141 --> 01:32:16.622]  Just do the damn work.
[01:32:17.022 --> 01:32:18.003]  And he's an extraordinary elitist.
[01:32:18.043 --> 01:32:20.225]  He basically denounced the people in rural Minnesota as
[01:32:40.683 --> 01:32:43.345]  All that's out there are mostly rocks and cows.
[01:32:43.845 --> 01:32:50.350]  Meanwhile, the education standards in the public schools in Minnesota continue to plummet.
[01:32:51.010 --> 01:32:53.412]  He wants to phase out fossil fuels.
[01:32:53.712 --> 01:33:02.358]  It's also against fracking and also against continued drilling and exploration of natural gas and oil in the United States.
[01:33:02.378 --> 01:33:02.818]  He's a nightmare.
[01:33:03.777 --> 01:33:13.726]  Yeah, and he's a carbon copy of his running mate, Kamala Harris, because he shares all of her far-out Marxist views.
[01:33:14.547 --> 01:33:21.674]  You know, if the idea was to have somebody who could talk, because their real problem politically here, Alex, is
[01:33:22.274 --> 01:33:24.995]  Kamala Harris cannot speak extemporaneously.
[01:33:25.055 --> 01:33:26.655]  She's not capable of it.
[01:33:26.675 --> 01:33:37.179]  I notice even now when she gets off a plane and there's a brief period in which she actually comes in contact with the media, they have her reading from a notebook.
[01:33:38.159 --> 01:33:40.600]  So she hasn't given a press conference.
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:43.881]  She hasn't done a one-on-one interview with any
[01:33:45.717 --> 01:33:50.360]  So they're hiding her just like Joe Biden.
[01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:53.922]  What is the end effect of this going to be?
[01:33:55.383 --> 01:34:02.107]  I think it will be ineffective, very tough to run a campaign in which your candidate can't actually speak.
[01:34:02.187 --> 01:34:06.970]  So they're going to try to limit her to canned speeches right off the teleprompter.
[01:34:07.710 --> 01:34:11.993]  And this whole charade about debates is exactly that, a charade.
[01:34:12.737 --> 01:34:14.080]  She doesn't want to debate.
[01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:17.567]  She's not going to debate if she can possibly help it.
[01:34:17.947 --> 01:34:18.569]  Donald Trump
[01:34:19.533 --> 01:34:28.538]  Who went into the CNN debate completely unafraid, despite the fact that the rules were rigged against him, entirely disadvantageous to him.
[01:34:28.859 --> 01:34:32.401]  Still went into the lion's den, but she won't go into Fox.
[01:34:32.461 --> 01:34:37.404]  In fact, the truth is, she won't go in anywhere because she fears a debate.
[01:34:37.744 --> 01:34:41.626]  Say anything you want about Donald Trump, one thing he's not is scared.
[01:34:41.666 --> 01:34:43.707]  He's never been scared in his life.
[01:34:44.007 --> 01:34:44.948]  He's afraid of nothing.
[01:34:45.737 --> 01:34:49.879]  And again, he said he would debate her, and then she said he wouldn't, and then now she refuses the Fox debate.
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:52.741]  Do you think they'll actually try to put that idiot up there?
[01:34:54.402 --> 01:34:58.384]  Sooner or later, I think it'll be governed by their poll numbers.
[01:34:58.484 --> 01:35:06.428]  I mean, recognize that I'm also predicted, said this on the show yesterday, that there is going to be chaos within her campaign.
[01:35:07.069 --> 01:35:11.111]  You have Barack Obama sending David Plouffe, sending
[01:35:11.531 --> 01:35:14.074]  This is too many chiefs and not enough Indians situation.
[01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:40.412]  So I think you're going to have infighting and infighting in a campaign, any campaign, but particularly a presidential campaign is a recipe for disaster.
[01:35:40.692 --> 01:35:44.813]  Your campaign has to be united under one leader and move forward.
[01:35:45.254 --> 01:35:54.216]  I predict there's going to be a lot of backbiting and a lot of disagreement within her campaign about whether she should debate, how she should debate.
[01:35:54.276 --> 01:35:54.696]  Absolutely.
[01:35:55.496 --> 01:35:57.638]  She's going to duck it as long as she possibly can.
[01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:16.390]  Trouble.
[01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:21.633]  He said we can make sure those weapons of war that I carried in war are only carried in war.
[01:36:21.953 --> 01:36:22.493]  Tim Walz.
[01:36:23.054 --> 01:36:27.256]  What's more disturbing about Tim Walz says here, Governor Walz was never in any war yet.
[01:36:27.496 --> 01:36:28.437]  Clearly said he did.
[01:36:28.477 --> 01:36:35.941]  Just like Senator Blumenthal was involved as a Marine at the Senate in a Toys for Tots program.
[01:36:35.981 --> 01:36:36.801]  Never left the U.S.
[01:36:37.161 --> 01:36:39.503]  Governor Walz again is a far-left gun grabber.
[01:36:39.823 --> 01:36:40.863]  So this is a big deal.
[01:36:40.883 --> 01:36:41.764]  He needs to be put on
[01:36:43.922 --> 01:36:45.709]  The Star Chamber, you know, debate here.
[01:36:45.749 --> 01:36:48.660]  He's been put on the spot about saying he was in combat.
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:49.082]  Here's the clip.
[01:36:51.949 --> 01:36:56.771]  Hope woke up like many of you did five weeks ago and said, Dad, you're the only person I know who's in elected office.
[01:36:56.791 --> 01:36:58.432]  You need to stop what's happening with this.
[01:36:58.532 --> 01:37:00.272]  I'll take my kick in the butt for the NRA.
[01:37:00.312 --> 01:37:02.413]  I spent 25 years in the Army, and I hunt.
[01:37:02.793 --> 01:37:05.194]  And I gave the money back, and I'll tell you what I have been doing.
[01:37:05.234 --> 01:37:09.576]  I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks.
[01:37:09.636 --> 01:37:10.877]  We can do CDC research.
[01:37:11.117 --> 01:37:18.460]  We can make sure we don't have reciprocal carry among states, and we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons were at.
[01:37:21.357 --> 01:37:22.838]  He carried in war.
[01:37:22.858 --> 01:37:24.858]  I want to get your take on that.
[01:37:24.958 --> 01:37:27.659]  And then Raskin, this cannot be underestimated.
[01:37:27.679 --> 01:37:30.400]  We know Raskin is one of the top strategy individuals.
[01:37:31.081 --> 01:37:35.262]  The congressman ran the fake J6 committee, interrogated myself, you, and others.
[01:37:35.322 --> 01:37:36.543]  We took the fifth wisely.
[01:37:36.563 --> 01:37:43.705]  Not that we had anything wrong to hide, but he would twist it, you know, saying we're going to have a civil war atmosphere.
[01:37:43.805 --> 01:37:45.646]  We're going to remove Trump when he wins.
[01:37:46.206 --> 01:37:48.327]  Let's go ahead and get that clip out of the way and get Roger's take on it.
[01:37:50.226 --> 01:38:05.189]  What can be put into the Constitution can slip away from you very quickly and the greatest example going on right now before our very eyes is Section 3 of the 14th Amendment which they're just disappearing with a magic wand as if it doesn't exist even though it could not be clearer
[01:38:05.869 --> 01:38:35.289]  What it's stating and so, you know, they want to kick it to Congress so it's gonna be up to us on January 6th 2025 to tell the rampaging Trump mobs that he's disqualified and then we need bodyguards for everybody in Civil War conditions all because the nine justices not all of them, but these justices who have Not many cases to look at every year not that much work to do a huge staff great protection simply do not want
[01:38:36.810 --> 01:38:43.097]  So he needs bodyguards for civil war.
[01:38:43.838 --> 01:38:47.843]  He's the guy that tried to take Trump off the ballot with no legal backing.
[01:38:48.363 --> 01:38:50.826]  Now he says that's tyranny of the Supreme Court.
[01:38:50.846 --> 01:38:53.369]  He's telegraphing something here very, very serious, Roger.
[01:38:54.778 --> 01:38:56.740]  Yeah, it's really, it's actually shocking, Alex.
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:01.663]  If I said anything even close to that, the FBI would raid my home again.
[01:39:02.544 --> 01:39:11.051]  Here he is basically saying that if Trump is elected, it's up to us in Congress to void that election.
[01:39:12.132 --> 01:39:22.803]  As far as the Constitution, Amendment 14, Article 3, which federal court has convicted Trump of the crime of insurrection?
[01:39:22.843 --> 01:39:24.024]  That would be none.
[01:39:24.665 --> 01:39:28.489]  And he's not even charged with that, not even in D.C.
[01:39:28.929 --> 01:39:32.553]  So I think because he's consumed with hate,
[01:39:33.333 --> 01:39:35.554]  And he has to blurt out their plan.
[01:39:36.294 --> 01:39:37.915]  He's laying it all out there.
[01:39:37.935 --> 01:39:40.496]  They don't really care how the people vote.
[01:39:40.596 --> 01:39:45.978]  They intend to try to void Trump's election if he wins.
[01:39:46.338 --> 01:39:50.199]  Raskin comes from a long line of Marxist radicals.
[01:39:50.939 --> 01:39:58.562]  He specifically leaked that he had proof of my involvement of January 6th, produced nothing whatsoever.
[01:39:59.042 --> 01:40:01.045]  And then destroyed the record afterwards.
[01:40:01.085 --> 01:40:01.807]  So you're dead on.
[01:40:01.827 --> 01:40:02.448]  You're just at the nail.
[01:40:02.548 --> 01:40:02.988]  Elaborate.
[01:40:03.389 --> 01:40:04.992]  He just let slip their plan.
[01:40:06.594 --> 01:40:07.476]  What do we do to counter this?
[01:40:08.590 --> 01:40:11.451]  Yeah, you've covered this extremely well at InfoWars.
[01:40:11.691 --> 01:40:28.675]  There is the same cabal of people, including a number at Georgetown University, who were involved in the Russian collusion hoax, who were involved in the two phony impeachments, who were involved deeply in the heisting of the 2020 election.
[01:40:30.255 --> 01:40:31.936]  And they're at it again.
[01:40:32.016 --> 01:40:38.541]  They're prepared to try to undo the 2024 election when President Donald Trump wins.
[01:40:39.301 --> 01:40:43.204]  And they're very extraordinarily open about this.
[01:40:43.724 --> 01:40:46.406]  Raskin just blurted it out there.
[01:40:46.986 --> 01:40:49.187]  I think that that's advocating insurrection.
[01:40:49.207 --> 01:40:51.609]  I actually think he's the guy who's in
[01:40:51.849 --> 01:40:53.429]  Violation of the law.
[01:40:54.189 --> 01:40:58.610]  But the brazenness of this is really extraordinary.
[01:40:59.230 --> 01:41:04.791]  And the attacks on the US Supreme Court, we've actually never had that in our country before.
[01:41:05.131 --> 01:41:10.252]  Do you think Richard Nixon was happy when the Supreme Court ordered that he had to release his tapes?
[01:41:10.372 --> 01:41:10.632]  No.
[01:41:10.893 --> 01:41:12.753]  What he did was comply.
[01:41:13.053 --> 01:41:14.713]  That's how our system works.
[01:41:15.573 --> 01:41:18.494]  You know, somebody might point out to Congressman Raskin,
[01:41:19.214 --> 01:41:25.098]  That we have three co-equal branches of government, and the Congress does not have precedence over the U.S.
[01:41:25.118 --> 01:41:25.879]  Supreme Court.
[01:41:26.539 --> 01:41:26.919]  Well, that's right.
[01:41:26.939 --> 01:41:41.809]  He's talking about a coup over the Supreme Court, which Democrats are openly saying, including Biden last week in a speech in Austin, that they plan to pack the Supreme Court and appoint a special prosecutor or overseer of it.
[01:41:42.249 --> 01:41:43.090]  What's the term they use?
[01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:43.890]  Not prosecutor.
[01:41:43.950 --> 01:41:45.691]  It's an inspector general.
[01:41:46.592 --> 01:41:47.853]  How does the legislative
[01:41:48.413 --> 01:41:51.580]  Put an inspector general over another branch of government.
[01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:59.176]  This is really an attempted legislative coup, but Democrats don't have full control of Congress, so he's kind of telling us he thinks they're going to steal Congress.
[01:42:00.666 --> 01:42:10.114]  Well, most importantly, it's a total violation of the separation of powers, which has served this country well for over 200 years.
[01:42:10.794 --> 01:42:12.776]  They're very brazen about this.
[01:42:12.836 --> 01:42:17.860]  Look, they are back to trying to use the criminal justice system in D.C.
[01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:23.585]  to try to get Donald Trump to trial on some charge prior to the election.
[01:42:24.145 --> 01:42:35.267]  The courts refused to delay his sentencing for the New York conviction that'll, without any question, in my view, be overturned on appeal.
[01:42:35.307 --> 01:42:40.708]  But remember, Trump can't file an appeal until after he's sentenced.
[01:42:40.768 --> 01:42:42.168]  And that was my next question, Roger.
[01:42:42.469 --> 01:42:49.010]  How is the lining up now with 90 days left to the election with all these frivolous civil and criminal cases?
[01:42:49.290 --> 01:42:50.130]  What's the numbers on that?
[01:42:51.601 --> 01:42:54.784]  Well, first of all, every single minute, every single day is crucial.
[01:42:54.844 --> 01:42:57.026]  We really are in the stretch now.
[01:42:57.586 --> 01:42:59.648]  Both parties have their candidates.
[01:43:00.529 --> 01:43:14.641]  And if they could get Donald Trump off the campaign trail on this New York charge, if he ends up being incarcerated, even if it's for 60 days or 90 days, that would be the most egregious example.
[01:43:14.681 --> 01:43:17.323]  And if they tried to kill him in Butler, they're going to try to kill him at Rikers.
[01:43:18.894 --> 01:43:19.154]  All right.
[01:43:35.736 --> 01:43:40.602]  Or at least I should say another assassination attempt against Trump.
[01:43:41.122 --> 01:43:48.450]  But just getting him off the campaign trail for any period of time between now and the election would be exactly what it looks like.
[01:43:48.670 --> 01:43:50.252]  Interference in the election.
[01:43:50.965 --> 01:43:54.946]  Look, what we're in the middle of here is a gigantic psyop.
[01:43:55.327 --> 01:43:59.688]  They're trying to convince us that Kamala Harris is wildly popular.
[01:44:00.248 --> 01:44:03.649]  They're trying to convince us that she is surging in the polls.
[01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:19.595]  They are money laundering millions and millions and millions of dollars into her campaign coffers through ActBlue, coming from donors who never really gave, in some cases may not even actually exist.
[01:44:20.315 --> 01:44:25.439]  It is a psy-op that is fueled by the mainstream media.
[01:44:26.119 --> 01:44:31.943]  You would think reporters or you would think real journalists would be asking, why no press conference?
[01:44:32.304 --> 01:44:34.145]  Why no one-on-one interviews?
[01:44:34.725 --> 01:44:38.888]  Why won't she submit to a questioning from real journalists?
[01:44:39.008 --> 01:44:43.311]  But no, what you get from the mainstream media is cheerleading.
[01:44:43.431 --> 01:44:44.152]  That's what you get.
[01:44:44.332 --> 01:44:50.917]  That's right, the time we have left, StoneZone.com, your own show, your own great events, it's all there, StoneZone.com, everybody should follow that, they are.
[01:44:51.698 --> 01:44:56.221]  Tulsi Gabbard, this is a microcosm, and you've helped break this the last week.
[01:44:57.402 --> 01:45:01.746]  Targeted for spying by the Obama administration, just to show you how criminal these people are.
[01:45:02.166 --> 01:45:05.989]  A woman, highly decorated, no criminal record, very popular, and they're spying on her.
[01:45:07.512 --> 01:45:09.273]  Yeah, actually, I want to correct myself.
[01:45:09.353 --> 01:45:10.334]  So here's what happened.
[01:45:10.874 --> 01:45:20.699]  As you know, she bested Kamala Harris in an extraordinary debate during the 2020 Democrat contest for the nomination.
[01:45:21.639 --> 01:45:23.801]  This was actually during the Trump administration.
[01:45:23.861 --> 01:45:25.381]  I was incorrect about that.
[01:45:26.322 --> 01:45:28.283]  But here's what's most interesting.
[01:45:28.703 --> 01:45:31.885]  The very next day, the day after the debate,
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:45.343]  Her name was placed on a secret domestic terrorist watch list and actual physical surveillance of her began the following day.
[01:45:46.093 --> 01:45:53.018]  Involving as many as five assets from TSA and federal marshals.
[01:45:53.078 --> 01:46:12.473]  Now we only know this because federal air marshals who have come forward and talked not only about the fact that we have really cut back federal air marshals on our flights and sending them instead to the southern border to hand out water bottles, have also come out with this extraordinary story that
[01:46:13.033 --> 01:46:25.556]  Tulsi Gabbard, a four-term congresswoman, a decorated combat veteran in both Iraq and Kuwait, and currently a lieutenant colonel in the U.S.
[01:46:25.716 --> 01:46:26.636]  Army Reserve.
[01:46:26.976 --> 01:46:40.239]  In fact, she was on Army Reserve duty this weekend when this story broke, is now being spied on by the Biden-Harris administration, started under Trump.
[01:46:41.119 --> 01:46:44.884]  Doubtful that Trump or anyone around him knew about it.
[01:46:44.924 --> 01:46:46.105]  Sure, sure, that's bureaucracy.
[01:46:46.165 --> 01:46:50.831]  So the point is, totally illegal, and they've even weaponized the TSA.
[01:46:50.971 --> 01:46:53.034]  I mean, there should be congressional hearings over this alone.
[01:46:54.566 --> 01:46:56.308]  It's clearly unconstitutional.
[01:46:56.328 --> 01:47:00.612]  There's no probable cause to surveil this patriot.
[01:47:00.932 --> 01:47:04.816]  She's being surveilled because she embarrassed Kamala Harris.
[01:47:04.876 --> 01:47:08.900]  And that's my final point, is we knew Trump was under surveillance the 2016 campaign and after.
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:11.462]  I first broke that, you broke it, it all turned out to be accurate.
[01:47:12.463 --> 01:47:14.165]  Imagine how much they're spying on Trump right now.
[01:47:15.543 --> 01:47:15.943]  Well, maybe.
[01:47:32.219 --> 01:47:33.520]  But maybe it's not the Iranians.
[01:47:56.846 --> 01:47:58.067]  Yeah, exactly what you said.
[01:47:58.127 --> 01:48:13.834]  So I think it was 48 hours after there was an attempt to kill Donald Trump and Butler, where Corey Comparatore, a brave Italian-American firefighter, did give his life, shielding his daughter and his wife.
[01:48:14.534 --> 01:48:18.676]  Yet the assassination deniers try to tell us that nothing happened.
[01:48:18.696 --> 01:48:21.077]  There was never any really an assault on Trump.
[01:48:21.797 --> 01:48:28.640]  48 hours after that, suddenly the FBI announces they've uncovered an Iranian plot to kill Trump.
[01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:46.568]  This to me smells like a setup, so that if there's another attack on Trump of any kind, a road bomb, a drone, or God forbid, another bullet, well then they can conveniently blame the Iranians.
[01:48:47.188 --> 01:48:49.669]  This story that a Pakistani man
[01:48:50.169 --> 01:48:53.791]  Trump was busted for planning to assassinate Trump.
[01:48:53.991 --> 01:48:58.613]  And it says, according to these stories, and other political figures, doesn't tell us who those are.
[01:48:59.334 --> 01:49:01.575]  This is all extremely suspicious.
[01:49:01.935 --> 01:49:12.540]  This looks to me like disinformation that's being put out in advance because they believe or they know there'll be another attack on Trump.
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:14.561]  We don't wish that into being.
[01:49:14.881 --> 01:49:16.442]  We pray that is not the case.
[01:49:16.522 --> 01:49:18.363]  We pray for his safety.
[01:49:18.983 --> 01:49:21.024]  But you ask me, the whole thing stinks.
[01:49:21.624 --> 01:49:27.066]  And I was able to predict it on July 13th and 14th on my show, they would blame Iran.
[01:49:27.106 --> 01:49:29.007]  Two days later they did, and now they've done this.
[01:49:29.067 --> 01:49:30.408]  Do five more minutes with us, Roger.
[01:49:30.908 --> 01:49:33.329]  Stonezone.com, stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:49:33.869 --> 01:49:41.372]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[01:49:41.992 --> 01:49:44.193]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[01:49:44.873 --> 01:49:55.066]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation, and that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[01:49:55.446 --> 01:50:01.614]  And I'm asking you now, at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison,
[01:50:02.515 --> 01:50:11.181]  To double down and support the broadcast more than ever, to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:50:11.401 --> 01:50:20.487]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[01:50:20.867 --> 01:50:22.028]  These are very, very popular.
[01:50:22.068 --> 01:50:23.109]  And I went and looked it up online.
[01:50:23.509 --> 01:50:24.430]  It is very, very popular.
[01:50:25.010 --> 01:50:25.931]  It's not an investment.
[01:50:26.131 --> 01:50:26.771]  It's a collectible.
[01:50:26.952 --> 01:50:33.856]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:50:34.317 --> 01:50:35.357]  Best group out there.
[01:50:35.678 --> 01:50:36.438]  Highest ratings.
[01:50:36.959 --> 01:50:37.839]  Amazing prices.
[01:50:37.879 --> 01:50:38.319]  The best.
[01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:42.622]  This is a collectible and a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[01:50:43.183 --> 01:50:50.908]  Then the bankruptcy started and the people that came in from the court said, we're not going to keep the outside people's products in here in your store.
[01:50:51.989 --> 01:50:52.830]  And they kicked him back.
[01:50:54.091 --> 01:50:57.673]  To the folks, despite the fact we'd already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[01:50:57.993 --> 01:51:09.140]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company, and now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:18.045]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[01:51:18.605 --> 01:51:19.947]  They're amazing cards.
[01:51:19.967 --> 01:51:21.789]  It's got original art I came up with.
[01:51:21.809 --> 01:51:23.711]  It's got the little bar of gold in there.
[01:51:23.751 --> 01:51:26.674]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Info War.
[01:51:26.694 --> 01:51:27.474]  You'll have a historical memento.
[01:51:41.568 --> 01:51:46.469]  As a keepsake for yourself, your family, for your children, and your grandchildren, because this is a historic fight.
[01:51:46.869 --> 01:51:50.690]  And this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[01:51:51.050 --> 01:51:52.370]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:55.911]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[01:51:56.491 --> 01:51:59.491]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[01:51:59.851 --> 01:52:04.692]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[01:52:05.072 --> 01:52:07.172]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[01:52:07.973 --> 01:52:09.953]  We've only got a few thousand of these left.
[01:52:10.453 --> 01:52:13.935]  And I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[01:52:13.955 --> 01:52:14.576]  Now, I want to be clear.
[01:52:15.136 --> 01:52:17.317]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[01:52:17.337 --> 01:52:18.118]  That's not what this is.
[01:52:18.138 --> 01:52:19.199]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[01:52:19.799 --> 01:52:32.887]  This is like, on NPR, if it still gets taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug that costs them $5, or a baseball cap that costs them $10, and you make a $100 donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the New World Order.
[01:52:33.167 --> 01:52:34.088]  I know you don't want to do that.
[01:52:34.808 --> 01:52:37.812]  This cost, I think they told me, more than $10 per card.
[01:52:38.613 --> 01:52:39.954]  Something like that, $10 or $11.
[01:52:40.495 --> 01:52:45.181]  And so the other $80-something will go to fund the operation.
[01:52:45.221 --> 01:52:48.364]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[01:52:48.905 --> 01:52:52.049]  So get your collectible card, your piece of art.
[01:52:52.449 --> 01:52:56.553]  With a little piece of gold in it today, and you will help keep us on air.
[01:52:56.934 --> 01:52:58.035]  The decision is yours.
[01:52:58.475 --> 01:52:59.516]  This is a limited edition.
[01:53:00.117 --> 01:53:04.461]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[01:53:05.142 --> 01:53:10.087]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time.
[01:53:10.387 --> 01:53:11.227]  Thank you for your support.
[01:53:11.247 --> 01:53:12.768]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[01:53:33.817 --> 01:53:34.437]  All right, Roger.
[01:53:34.697 --> 01:53:39.179]  One of the chief things I wanted to get you on about today was these claims that Iran's trying to kill Trump.
[01:53:39.699 --> 01:53:42.780]  I predicted days after they tried to kill him on the 13th, they would do that.
[01:53:42.821 --> 01:53:45.001]  They then put the story out, nobody bought it.
[01:53:45.341 --> 01:53:50.283]  Now they've made this arrest of this Pakistani national supposedly trying to organize people to kill Trump and others.
[01:53:51.144 --> 01:53:56.186]  This looks very clear to me that they're trying to set up a new attempt, the deep state is, and they want this as the cover.
[01:53:56.306 --> 01:54:00.407]  And Trump kind of fell into the trap with a true social post that if he's killed, blow up Iran.
[01:54:02.328 --> 01:54:03.749]  I don't want Trump to dig his own grave here.
[01:54:03.769 --> 01:54:04.950]  We've got four minutes to break.
[01:54:04.970 --> 01:54:06.071]  You've got the floor to break this down.
[01:54:07.112 --> 01:54:09.734]  Yeah, Alex, this is very, very, very disturbing.
[01:54:10.175 --> 01:54:23.326]  The first thing is a Fox story that says that the FBI comes out publicly and says that the Iranians are seeking to infiltrate and disrupt Donald Trump's campaign.
[01:54:23.948 --> 01:54:26.489]  Didn't get much coverage, but it was a marker.
[01:54:27.009 --> 01:54:38.453]  Then, of course, is the attempt on Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania, where, through the grace of God, he survives by turning his head at exactly the right moment.
[01:54:39.274 --> 01:54:45.516]  And we find more and more about the fact that it appears the Secret Service stood down.
[01:54:46.076 --> 01:54:50.758]  Two days later, we hear of an Iranian plot to kill Trump.
[01:54:51.598 --> 01:54:54.200]  Which, to me, is deeply disturbing.
[01:54:54.781 --> 01:55:04.568]  And then that's followed by the charges against this Pakistani national, claiming that he was planning to assassinate Trump and others.
[01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:12.835]  My fear is kind of obvious, that these are all being set up as a pretext for another attack on Trump.
[01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:24.289]  We've talked on your show about how a number of Christian prophets, some that you found out about, others I learned about, predict exactly that.
[01:55:24.449 --> 01:55:34.438]  So if there was ever a time that we needed to be praying for the safety of Donald Trump, as God has preserved his life so far, I think we'll continue to do so.
[01:55:34.839 --> 01:55:38.862]  But if there was ever a time for prayer, that time would be now.
[01:55:39.443 --> 01:55:40.143]  The entire
[01:55:41.084 --> 01:55:53.868]  The public relations operation of the deep state is trying to set up Iran as the bad guy here, so that if something happens to Trump, well, they can conveniently blame the Iranians.
[01:55:54.188 --> 01:55:55.189]  By the way, it's interesting.
[01:55:55.449 --> 01:56:07.513]  Lyndon Johnson tried to blame the Russians and the Cubans for the murder of John F. Kennedy, when in fact, neither one of them had anything whatsoever to do with John Kennedy's death.
[01:56:07.873 --> 01:56:08.793]  Well, exactly, Roger.
[01:56:08.813 --> 01:56:09.774]  And to show how clear this is.
[01:56:10.954 --> 01:56:21.258]  I said on the 13th 14th and 15th and they said the next day on the 16th that Iranians may be involved and then and then they bring it back out again and now made these arrests.
[01:56:21.858 --> 01:56:31.702]  This looks to me like very clear cover right after Trump says last week if I get killed and it's Iran blow Iran up and I'm not trying to criticize Trump but he kind of is walking into their trap right there.
[01:56:31.962 --> 01:56:35.463]  To me this is very obvious to the point of I predicted it before it happened.
[01:56:37.051 --> 01:56:48.034]  Well, and also it's an attempt to immunize themselves from the criticism that they're not on top of it, that they're not sufficiently guaranteeing the president's safety.
[01:56:48.094 --> 01:56:54.215]  So they indict this guy to kind of reassure people that, no, no, we are doing the job.
[01:56:54.275 --> 01:56:57.616]  I think it had that effect as well.
[01:56:58.236 --> 01:57:02.237]  Look, I don't trust anything they say based on their track record.
[01:57:02.277 --> 01:57:05.918]  And I still believe prayer is our best course right now.
[01:57:06.258 --> 01:57:07.563]  I totally agree with you.
[01:57:07.603 --> 01:57:09.911]  StoneZone.com, you host your own shows.
[01:57:10.292 --> 01:57:11.456]  What time are those shows, Roger?
[01:57:12.293 --> 01:57:16.196]  Eight o'clock tonight on Rumble, The Stone Zone on Rumble.
[01:57:16.437 --> 01:57:19.719]  Check us out, eight o'clock Eastern, The Stone Zone.
[01:57:20.060 --> 01:57:24.703]  We have a great, great show today with J.C.
[01:57:24.763 --> 01:57:25.144]  Hawkins.
[01:57:25.164 --> 01:57:41.057]  He talked to us about the history of the deep state and comparing the assassinations of James Forrestal, Secretary of Defense, Joe McCarthy, John F. Kennedy, with the attempted murder of Donald J. Trump.
[01:57:41.517 --> 01:57:44.660]  Well, not just going back to Butler, which I get why Trump's doing it.
[01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:45.721]  Very dangerous, he's doing it.
[01:57:46.201 --> 01:57:48.783]  He needs to come out and the Secret Service clearly stood down.
[01:57:48.843 --> 01:57:49.624]  There's a consensus.
[01:57:50.084 --> 01:57:57.270]  We know that he needs to get on the offense and let them know that if they do it, he's not going to blame the Iranians because that's a very dangerous thing that happened.
[01:57:57.630 --> 01:57:58.951]  Roger Stone, thank you so much.
[01:58:00.392 --> 01:58:01.453]  Great to be with you, Alex.
[01:58:01.473 --> 01:58:03.375]  Let's hope the President sees this show.
[01:58:04.011 --> 01:58:04.391]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:05.032 --> 01:58:05.392]  All right.
[01:58:05.553 --> 01:58:11.318]  There goes Roger Stone back in 60 seconds with Max Keiser on the economy, Bitcoin and more.
[01:58:11.358 --> 01:58:11.778]  Stay with us.
[01:58:11.979 --> 01:58:18.785]  We're going to Max Keiser on all the big political developments, Bitcoin, Trump, the assassination attempt, everything in this hour.
[01:58:19.285 --> 01:58:21.207]  But I'm going to spend a few minutes here reminding you.
[01:58:22.208 --> 01:58:23.509]  It takes money to win a war.
[01:58:23.929 --> 01:58:25.450]  Plus, we've got great products you need.
[01:58:25.911 --> 01:58:30.894]  So, I need you to go to drjonesnaturals.com for the next level foundational energy that's selling out.
[01:58:31.254 --> 01:58:32.995]  It's not like any other energy system out there.
[01:58:33.015 --> 01:58:35.217]  It is a stimulant, but it has a massive effect, but don't let down.
[01:58:35.557 --> 01:58:37.919]  And all the nano silver products, drjonesnaturals.com.

[01:58:44.483 --> 01:58:49.787]  These are amazing, game-changing products, and you have to make the decision to fund us in this fight.
[01:58:49.867 --> 01:58:50.807]  We can't do it without you.
[01:58:50.867 --> 01:58:51.748]  I'm asking humbly.
[01:58:53.009 --> 01:58:53.931]  Get these great products.
[01:58:54.071 --> 01:58:54.972]  Empower yourself.

[01:59:13.325 --> 01:59:15.246]  I cannot do it without you.
[01:59:15.326 --> 01:59:16.227]  I need your support.
[01:59:16.367 --> 01:59:17.308]  Plus, these are great products.
[01:59:17.688 --> 01:59:18.749]  Make the decision out of it.
[01:59:18.789 --> 01:59:22.311]  I know there's all this media and all this entertainment and all this stuff, but we're the tip of the spear.
[01:59:22.671 --> 01:59:23.832]  But we cannot do it without you.
[01:59:23.892 --> 01:59:27.114]  drjonesnaturals.com or infowarrestore.com.
[01:59:27.354 --> 01:59:30.316]  Here's a quick clip on Dr. Jones Naturals and we'll go to Max Keiser.
[01:59:31.677 --> 01:59:32.537]  Nitric Boost.
[01:59:33.478 --> 01:59:33.938]  Turmeric 95.
[01:59:36.212 --> 01:59:39.134]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[01:59:40.075 --> 01:59:45.059]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[01:59:45.559 --> 01:59:52.724]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[01:59:53.265 --> 01:59:55.266]  They let us private label their products.
[01:59:55.286 --> 01:59:56.147]  That's why you've already heard of
[01:59:57.027 --> 01:59:58.067]  Body's Old Turmeric Formula?
[01:59:58.387 --> 02:00:01.128]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[02:00:01.388 --> 02:00:02.688]  This is just their brand of that.
[02:00:03.049 --> 02:00:06.329]  And so, it is available under Turmeric 95.
[02:00:06.729 --> 02:00:07.330]  That's the name.
[02:00:07.610 --> 02:00:14.071]  So, we're sold out of Body's, but we have Turmeric 95 that is, again, the same concentrated turmeric.
[02:00:14.291 --> 02:00:15.352]  Same thing with Nitric Boost.
[02:00:15.792 --> 02:00:17.412]  Nitric Boost came from this company.
[02:00:17.452 --> 02:00:19.473]  They even let us use their name.
[02:00:19.753 --> 02:00:20.753]  It's now our best seller.
[02:00:20.953 --> 02:00:21.953]  We sold out of our version.
[02:00:22.233 --> 02:00:23.674]  Their version has a white model.
[02:00:24.014 --> 02:00:25.354]  It's the exact same thing.
[02:00:25.934 --> 02:00:27.616]  You get it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:00:27.776 --> 02:00:30.378]  So check out InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:33.081]  InfoWarsMD.
[02:00:34.042 --> 02:00:34.763]  Nitric Boost.
[02:00:34.943 --> 02:00:35.764]  Tumeric 95.
[02:00:35.824 --> 02:00:36.324]  It's all there.
[02:00:36.384 --> 02:00:37.205]  InfoWarsMD.
[02:00:37.645 --> 02:00:38.646]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:00:39.287 --> 02:00:39.607]  All right.
[02:00:39.707 --> 02:00:41.749]  Couldn't get Max Keiser on at a better time.
[02:00:41.869 --> 02:00:43.431]  What a great geopolitical strategist.
[02:00:43.951 --> 02:00:46.113]  Been interviewing Max for at least 20 years.
[02:00:46.774 --> 02:00:48.796]  He was a top stockbroker decades ago.
[02:00:48.836 --> 02:00:50.397]  He's a Bitcoin master.
[02:00:51.218 --> 02:00:57.581]  And we've got Trump just a week or so ago at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville saying, I'm going to do a strategic reserve of Bitcoin.
[02:00:58.101 --> 02:01:02.963]  Sure, Bitcoin went down, everything went down on this big sell-off, but with Trump getting in, what would happen to that?
[02:01:03.003 --> 02:01:08.785]  You have Bukele, where he lives down in El Salvador, in three years turning everything around.
[02:01:09.265 --> 02:01:13.647]  We are going to go over all of it with the mighty Max Keiser in the next 50 minutes.
[02:01:14.007 --> 02:01:17.689]  But Max, as a geopolitical analyst, we'll cover Bitcoin, we'll cover everything you want to get to.
[02:01:18.129 --> 02:01:25.972]  But first, the attempted assassination of Trump, the Israel escalation with Iran.
[02:01:26.732 --> 02:01:28.533]  How would you describe this time we're in?
[02:01:29.713 --> 02:01:31.594]  And what would your advice be to Trump?
[02:01:31.714 --> 02:01:33.175]  And what would have happened if Trump got killed?
[02:01:33.215 --> 02:01:36.676]  I mean, people need to understand the danger zone we're in.
[02:01:36.696 --> 02:01:40.958]  So just your response to the Trump assassination attempt.
[02:01:42.102 --> 02:01:48.245]  Back on July 13th, you know, now almost a month ago, and where do you see this going?
[02:01:49.785 --> 02:01:53.567]  I was totally shocked by the July 13 assassination attempt.
[02:01:54.347 --> 02:02:08.713]  And I, as a media person, I was shocked that they had some Pulitzer Prize winning photographers that had never gone to a Trump rally before waiting there on stage to take the photos of his splattered brains.
[02:02:09.433 --> 02:02:15.939]  To get that on the news wires as quickly as possible to shock America into accepting this agenda.
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:20.424]  That is so key because they hadn't covered in a year any of his rallies live.
[02:02:20.444 --> 02:02:20.784]  You're right.
[02:02:21.144 --> 02:02:24.267]  They had all these reporters there and they were all covering on every channel.
[02:02:24.407 --> 02:02:25.909]  Wow, that's a big piece of evidence.
[02:02:27.165 --> 02:02:44.619]  Yeah, and it was set up as a photo op in that regard, and they wanted to create post-traumatic stress disorder by flashing that photo of Trump head exploding on the air for 24 hours a day for weeks on end, like 9-11.
[02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:46.441]  Yeah.
[02:03:01.593 --> 02:03:01.994]  I don't
[02:03:17.253 --> 02:03:22.718]  A dictatorial style government in the United States.
[02:03:22.999 --> 02:03:24.440]  But you just said it perfectly.
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:28.864]  They wanted to blow his head off to demoralize and trigger a civil war.
[02:03:28.904 --> 02:03:31.667]  We have Jamie Raskin saying they're only planning a civil war now.
[02:03:32.888 --> 02:03:34.790]  How is it going for the globalist faction?
[02:03:34.830 --> 02:03:35.911]  What do you think is going to unfold now?
[02:03:38.169 --> 02:03:45.580]  Well, for those who pray to God, I think let's pray harder because I think that's the only thing that stands between the U.S.
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:47.642]  and outright tyranny at this point would be
[02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:50.781]  The God as he intervened on July 13th.
[02:03:51.561 --> 02:03:59.604]  I really do believe that that five one hundredths of a second difference between life and death for Trump on that date was divine intervention.
[02:04:00.345 --> 02:04:02.306]  And that's what we have to rely on.
[02:04:02.446 --> 02:04:05.027]  And throughout history, sometimes that's the only thing you have to rely on.
[02:04:05.067 --> 02:04:05.987]  And sometimes it works.
[02:04:06.607 --> 02:04:10.289]  And I think the US is on the precipice now of being completely obliterated.
[02:04:10.869 --> 02:04:11.970]  We're good to go.
[02:04:32.142 --> 02:04:35.786]  Last week, they had a huge story about the yen carry trade.
[02:04:36.006 --> 02:04:39.670]  You know, this is something that was suddenly on everyone's lips.
[02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:41.812]  It's something I've talked about for many years.
[02:04:41.852 --> 02:04:43.974]  I've talked to you on your show about it.
[02:04:44.014 --> 02:04:45.315]  What is the yen carry trade?
[02:04:45.676 --> 02:04:52.622]  And it just speaks to the nature of the global central banking system, which has never been more leveraged and never been more fragile.
[02:04:53.618 --> 02:05:12.245]  And they are in a position where they have to either print $30, $40 trillion worth of more fiat paper to bail out these banks, or if they go into a situation where they let the banks fail, then that definitely will precipitate complete social unrest and then they want to be able to deal with that.
[02:05:12.325 --> 02:05:13.806]  I noticed last week the only stock
[02:05:14.466 --> 02:05:14.867]  I think so.
[02:05:32.884 --> 02:05:36.888]  Hard money and real money and real accountability and real accounting.
[02:05:37.328 --> 02:05:38.950]  And they rely on money printing.
[02:05:39.610 --> 02:05:43.574]  And the money printing is always in the hands of the worst parts of society.
[02:05:44.154 --> 02:05:46.877]  And you have the worst people in charge of the money printers.
[02:05:46.957 --> 02:05:51.501]  It's called, technically it's called a kakistocracy, ruled by the worst amongst us.
[02:05:51.581 --> 02:05:53.163]  It's worse than even a kleptocracy.
[02:05:53.803 --> 02:06:04.416]  And this is the problem, is that the people with the worst intentions are the ones with the greatest control over the money printing, and they're doing the worst possible things they can do.
[02:06:04.796 --> 02:06:06.919]  With real leadership, I can instantly turn things around.
[02:06:07.984 --> 02:06:12.825]  Yeah, but Kelly is really the new shining city on a hill.
[02:06:12.905 --> 02:06:14.725]  El Salvador is coming out of the fourth turning.
[02:06:14.785 --> 02:06:16.846]  El Salvador was in a 40-year bear market.
[02:06:16.866 --> 02:06:23.227]  They went through a civil war, they went through the gang war, and they really are really what America should be aspiring to.
[02:06:23.567 --> 02:06:34.368]  They also put Bitcoin as a strategic reserves on the state's balance sheet, and they made Bitcoin legal tender, and it's ironic that now Trump is now saying we want to put Bitcoin on our balance sheet.
[02:06:34.468 --> 02:06:36.569]  That was my next question, so stay there.
[02:06:36.609 --> 02:06:37.229]  Let's play the club.
[02:06:37.629 --> 02:06:40.631]  This is Trump making Bitcoin a strategic reserve.
[02:06:41.131 --> 02:06:41.992]  This is amazing.
[02:06:42.012 --> 02:06:42.512]  Here it is.
[02:06:42.552 --> 02:06:46.895]  This is what Max was calling for on the show a year ago, six months ago, two months ago.
[02:06:47.235 --> 02:06:54.760]  He said Trump, if he's elected, I don't know if you remember he said this, Trump should follow Bukele and he should make it a strategic national reserve.
[02:06:54.781 --> 02:06:55.121]  Here it is.
[02:06:55.561 --> 02:07:02.045]  Americans do not realize that the United States governor is among the largest holders of Bitcoin.
[02:07:02.065 --> 02:07:02.866]  Does anyone know that?
[02:07:04.364 --> 02:07:05.005]  How about that?
[02:07:05.425 --> 02:07:12.892]  The federal government has almost 210,000 Bitcoin, or 1% of the total supply that will ever exist.
[02:07:13.392 --> 02:07:19.878]  But for too long, our government has violated the cardinal rule that every Bitcoiner knows by heart.
[02:07:20.398 --> 02:07:22.640]  Never sell your Bitcoin, right?
[02:07:28.105 --> 02:07:29.306]  That's right, isn't it, huh?
[02:07:29.606 --> 02:07:30.107]  That's right.
[02:07:32.133 --> 02:07:33.254]  How did I figure that one?
[02:07:34.174 --> 02:07:35.875]  Never sell your Bitcoin!
[02:07:35.915 --> 02:07:51.563]  And so, as the final part of my plan today, I am announcing that if I am elected, it will be the policy of my administration, United States of America, to keep 100% of all the Bitcoin the U.S.
[02:07:51.623 --> 02:07:55.245]  government currently holds or acquires into the future.
[02:07:55.285 --> 02:07:55.645]  We'll keep 100%.
[02:07:55.705 --> 02:07:57.866]  I hope you do well, please.
[02:08:00.267 --> 02:08:08.352]  This will serve, in effect, as the core of the strategic national Bitcoin stockpile, as you know.
[02:08:10.573 --> 02:08:14.875]  Max Keiser, is that not a direct threat on the private central banks, what he just did?
[02:08:15.175 --> 02:08:16.676]  Is that not a total declaration of war?
[02:08:18.337 --> 02:08:19.978]  Totally, you know, absolutely.
[02:08:20.018 --> 02:08:26.902]  Now, to put this in a context, on your show, going back to 2019, I coined the term global hash war.
[02:08:28.186 --> 02:08:31.088]  And at that time people were saying, well, what if governments ban Bitcoin?
[02:08:31.168 --> 02:08:34.910]  What if, what if, what if, uh, you know, and I said, no, the opposite is going to happen.
[02:08:34.970 --> 02:08:37.672]  Governments are going to embrace it and they're going to want to put it on their reserves.
[02:08:38.452 --> 02:08:41.274]  And in fact, they're going to be competitively trying to do so.
[02:08:41.874 --> 02:08:44.496]  And this is part of the game theory built into Bitcoin.
[02:08:44.796 --> 02:08:47.678]  And now the United States is entering into the global hash war.
[02:08:48.138 --> 02:08:50.659]  The El Salvador is already leading the global hash war.
[02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:54.582]  And other countries like Argentina and others are waking up to the fact that
[02:08:55.842 --> 02:09:00.325]  It's like, let me put this into really the context here for you, Alex.
[02:09:00.785 --> 02:09:02.646]  It's like when gunpowder came around.
[02:09:02.966 --> 02:09:07.389]  When gunpowder came around, the countries that adopted gunpowder stayed in the game.
[02:09:07.569 --> 02:09:11.931]  But those who did not got eaten by the countries that had gunpowder.
[02:09:12.271 --> 02:09:20.456]  Like if you don't have Bitcoin on your strategic reserve as a country, you're going to go fade away, you're going to disappear or be gobbled up by the countries that don't have Bitcoin.
[02:09:20.496 --> 02:09:21.677]  Sure, it's like Nobel invented dynamite.
[02:09:21.837 --> 02:09:22.157]  Same thing.
[02:09:24.110 --> 02:09:24.751]  Exactly right.
[02:09:24.931 --> 02:09:30.153]  So Bitcoin is to money what dynamite or gunpowder is to warfare.
[02:09:30.293 --> 02:09:35.595]  It's perfect money and everything else, as I say, goes to zero against Bitcoin.
[02:09:35.975 --> 02:09:42.158]  So Trump, anyway, he made this announcement and of course the Bitcoin audience is very excited by it.
[02:09:42.258 --> 02:09:49.121]  But it is a direct threat to the central banks because the central banks are empowered by the fact that they can print
[02:09:49.801 --> 02:09:50.001]  Yeah.
[02:10:10.091 --> 02:10:10.511]  I think so.
[02:10:26.657 --> 02:10:40.821]  El Salvador, as he made a misstatement of fact, in fact saying that El Salvador was dumping criminals in the U.S., and he has since walked that statement back after a lot of us Bitcoiners got in touch with his people and said, yo, dude, you're absolutely wrong about that.
[02:10:41.221 --> 02:10:43.001]  So he corrected himself on that.
[02:10:43.121 --> 02:10:48.163]  So I appreciate his ability to stay up to date on what's really happening in El Salvador.
[02:10:48.183 --> 02:10:48.363]  Sure, sure.
[02:10:48.383 --> 02:10:49.623]  So only back to Bitcoin, but larger picture.
[02:10:51.769 --> 02:10:58.499]  Did Buffett know Japan was going to have the problem, or did he trigger the problem selling 55% of Apple stock last Friday?
[02:11:00.542 --> 02:11:04.247]  He's got a huge position in Apple, obviously.
[02:11:04.287 --> 02:11:05.609]  I think there's two things going on there.
[02:11:05.649 --> 02:11:07.992]  Number one is that
[02:11:09.222 --> 02:11:09.843]  We're good to go.
[02:11:27.197 --> 02:11:31.261]  And number two, he's also going to be passing the baton on to his successor.
[02:11:31.761 --> 02:11:43.111]  And the word I'm getting is that he wants to hand them a lot of cash so they can manage Berkshire Hathaway in their own image without having the burden of having to deal with his portfolio that he built up over the years.
[02:11:43.131 --> 02:11:44.672]  So he's raising cash for his successors.
[02:11:44.712 --> 02:11:47.915]  But he now has $250, $260 billion in dollars, a quarter trillion of dollars.
[02:11:47.935 --> 02:11:49.156]  But you know, all those dollars are
[02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:54.340]  We're good to go.
[02:12:23.980 --> 02:12:24.381]  We're good.
[02:12:38.669 --> 02:12:42.513]  How Bitcoin will help America get rid of their $32 trillion worth of debt.
[02:12:42.533 --> 02:12:43.995]  I mean, this is how you do it.
[02:12:44.015 --> 02:12:53.224]  You have to leverage your way out of your debt hole by using cheap interest rates to sell... There's no doubt Bitcoin's not going to be stopped now.
[02:12:54.065 --> 02:12:57.046]  So larger picture, where is the global economy right now?
[02:12:57.587 --> 02:12:58.387]  What do you expect to happen?
[02:12:58.407 --> 02:13:07.511]  The global economy, okay, to get back to the yen carry trade for a second, so what people don't understand in the last 20 years, I mean, they understand how leverage works.
[02:13:07.551 --> 02:13:11.693]  They understand how the derivatives market is just more leverage on top of leverage.
[02:13:11.713 --> 02:13:12.834]  That's what a derivative is.
[02:13:12.934 --> 02:13:18.096]  It derives its value from another contract that derives its value from a third contract, and they're all debt.
[02:13:18.596 --> 02:13:20.257]  So you have a layer cake of debt.
[02:13:20.718 --> 02:13:23.640]  And so the global economy is $300 trillion in debt.
[02:13:24.321 --> 02:13:27.563]  And it's the highest debt level it's ever been in.
[02:13:27.583 --> 02:13:38.011]  And so what's happening now is that at the foundational level of the global debt pyramid has always been the Japanese yen, because the Japanese yen starting in 1989 went into recession.
[02:13:39.452 --> 02:13:39.733]  Yes, we are.
[02:13:56.857 --> 02:14:08.234]  Is getting to the point where the Japanese government has to defend the yen from crashing so they're raising interest rates and this effectively is calling time on the global Ponzi scheme.
[02:14:09.036 --> 02:14:11.259]  Last week we saw a huge sell-off as the yen
[02:14:12.375 --> 02:14:12.495]  What's
[02:14:30.666 --> 02:14:36.131]  The very last inning of this 30-year global debt Ponzi scheme based on the Japanese yen carry trade.
[02:14:36.151 --> 02:14:40.695]  We made a film about it for Al Jazeera, you know, 15 years ago about the yen carry trade.
[02:14:40.715 --> 02:14:52.686]  So this has been building in the system now for 15-20 years, and like any system where it becomes ultimately overly leveraged, it gets to a point where you have systemic collapse.
[02:14:53.127 --> 02:14:56.010]  And so the 2008 collapse, which was enormous,
[02:14:56.710 --> 02:15:04.177]  Uh, this is, this is now going to be the 2024-2025 collapse, which would be much bigger because it'll be... No, I totally agree.
[02:15:04.237 --> 02:15:04.998]  So let me ask you this.
[02:15:06.072 --> 02:15:09.574]  How is the establishment going to respond versus how we should respond?
[02:15:09.614 --> 02:15:14.476]  Because we have the FDIC report video last year where they said bail-ins are coming.
[02:15:14.836 --> 02:15:15.737]  We'll play that clip.
[02:15:16.077 --> 02:15:21.300]  I mean, clearly they want to create a unified ledger, make everybody give up their assets, put it in a big pool, you'll owe nothing, you'll be happy.
[02:15:21.700 --> 02:15:22.420]  That's their plan.
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:26.422]  In fact, let's play that FDIC clip.
[02:15:26.442 --> 02:15:28.023]  Here it is.
[02:15:28.043 --> 02:15:31.485]  There are some market tests of whether you're being heard.
[02:15:32.165 --> 02:15:33.326]  And I think about TLAC.
[02:15:34.497 --> 02:15:43.323]  So TLAC spread should respond to good and bad news about the institutions.
[02:15:43.403 --> 02:15:44.704]  And it's really important.
[02:15:44.724 --> 02:15:47.026]  I mean, it's a little bit conflicted, right?
[02:15:47.086 --> 02:15:53.551]  I mean, it's important that people understand they can be bailed in, but you don't want a huge run on the institution.
[02:15:53.651 --> 02:15:55.492]  But they're going to be.
[02:15:55.912 --> 02:15:59.295]  And it could be an early warning signal.
[02:16:00.197 --> 02:16:04.619]  to the FDIC and the primary regulators when these things happen.
[02:16:04.659 --> 02:16:19.345]  And there may be some other prices, this is similar to what Jay was saying, in the market that you can tell whether people understand who's going to be protected, who isn't going to be protected.
[02:16:19.365 --> 02:16:27.168]  It would be, I think, an interesting study to look at the evolution of market prices in a situation like March of 2020.
[02:16:28.536 --> 02:16:31.641]  For example, and see whether people understood what might happen.
[02:16:42.298 --> 02:16:53.709]  Well, you know, bail-ins are something that have been talked about for a while, since Cyprus bail-in around the 2007-2008 year, I believe, during that last crisis.
[02:16:54.069 --> 02:17:00.636]  But I think since then, we've had the central bank digital currency, or the CBDC, has really matured, and that becomes an option.
[02:17:00.816 --> 02:17:04.598]  And so, where we're heading, I would look at what's happening in the UK right now, the United Kingdom.
[02:17:04.618 --> 02:17:14.203]  The United Kingdom is becoming a 360-degree panopticon surveillance state, including, that'll include a CBDC introduction.
[02:17:14.684 --> 02:17:23.789]  Every single, every moment, every, there's just, the number of cameras per square meter in the UK is incredibly high, could be the highest in the world.
[02:17:24.685 --> 02:17:28.067]  It's becoming really dystopian, nightmarish surveillance state in the UK.
[02:17:28.787 --> 02:17:31.269]  And I think that's where the globe is heading.
[02:17:31.289 --> 02:17:33.670]  I think that the UK is already kind of there.
[02:17:33.690 --> 02:17:43.736]  You know, they're on the leading edge of how the state is going to react to this financial nightmare as it unfolds.
[02:17:43.756 --> 02:17:47.418]  They're going to become, the surveillance aspect will be pushed
[02:17:48.178 --> 02:17:50.899]  I think harder than the bail-in.
[02:17:51.300 --> 02:17:55.922]  So in other words, if your surveillance is good enough, then you'll just be rationed money.
[02:17:56.342 --> 02:17:59.584]  So you will be rationed a certain number of dollars per week.
[02:17:59.644 --> 02:18:03.085]  And by the way, the UK is calling for lockdowns because of civil unrest.
[02:18:03.465 --> 02:18:05.827]  They're calling for arresting Elon Musk, everybody else.
[02:18:06.227 --> 02:18:06.827]  I have all the clips.
[02:18:06.847 --> 02:18:07.467]  You're absolutely right.
[02:18:07.487 --> 02:18:08.568]  They are going to full tyranny.
[02:18:09.540 --> 02:18:24.130]  Yeah, and you know, what I've said on your show probably for 20 years is I mentioned the casino gulag, and what I mean by that is that you're locked in your home, you're being surveyed 24-7, you have access to the internet,
[02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:48.004]  And the only way you have you can afford you can eat food for that day is to click on ads on online and you get a little protein pill or something and but you're in a gulag you're in a digital gulag and and you and it's a it's it's designed like a casino so you're you think you know it's like it's it's an artificial AI driven casino world and you're that's how you exist in that world
[02:18:48.764 --> 02:18:52.027]  And I think that we're seeing that play out in the UK right now.
[02:18:52.107 --> 02:18:52.587]  I agree.
[02:18:52.607 --> 02:18:56.050]  So how does that clash between the world waking up work with that?
[02:18:57.812 --> 02:19:02.335]  Well, in the United States, we have the Second Amendment and, you know, more every day.
[02:19:02.355 --> 02:19:08.460]  You know, the importance of that feature in the Constitution is becomes more
[02:19:09.992 --> 02:19:10.353]  I think so.
[02:19:25.473 --> 02:19:28.175]  And Jamie Raskin and all of them are saying they want civil war.
[02:19:28.255 --> 02:19:28.876]  That's their answer.
[02:19:52.472 --> 02:19:55.636]  Well, you know, freedom's not free, Alex.
[02:19:56.377 --> 02:20:10.153]  And when you have a group of entrenched monopolists who are looting, and looting has become the way of life, and looting has become accepted, then you have an economy that's destroyed.
[02:20:10.473 --> 02:20:10.873]  I agree.
[02:20:10.893 --> 02:20:11.253]  Stay there.
[02:20:11.333 --> 02:20:12.714]  Back with Max Keiser straight ahead.
[02:20:12.734 --> 02:20:15.015]  Many years ago, I coined the term 360Win.
[02:20:33.001 --> 02:20:35.664]  That's another way of saying it's a non-zero-sum game.
[02:20:36.044 --> 02:20:40.808]  When you have a sum game, it's a pizza, there's only so many pieces, it doesn't get bigger.
[02:20:41.209 --> 02:20:47.094]  But if something is symbiotic, if something empowers everybody involved with it, it is a 360 win.

[02:21:40.433 --> 02:21:41.174]  Big picture.
[02:21:41.334 --> 02:21:42.776]  We're at the end of a financial era.
[02:21:43.397 --> 02:21:45.199]  They want to bring in the central bank digital currencies.
[02:21:45.219 --> 02:21:46.280]  They're in total panic mode.
[02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:49.163]  Trump says he'll stop the central bank digital currencies.
[02:21:49.684 --> 02:21:50.645]  They're totally scared of Trump.
[02:21:50.665 --> 02:21:51.646]  They're obviously going to try again.
[02:21:52.107 --> 02:21:54.429]  How would you quantify where we are right now?
[02:21:54.449 --> 02:21:57.633]  And what are you personally thinking is going to happen?
[02:21:59.884 --> 02:22:07.690]  I think you're at the bitter end, Alex Jones, and it's time to make a choice.
[02:22:09.331 --> 02:22:16.997]  My choice is to have an exit strategy and be in El Salvador, and I think that a lot of people should make that choice.
[02:22:17.017 --> 02:22:21.160]  Others are going to say, you know what, I'm going to stay and I'm going to fight
[02:22:22.140 --> 02:22:27.043]  And that's a choice other people, you know, everyone's going to have to make their own choice.
[02:22:27.123 --> 02:22:38.750]  But we're at the end, and this is the time now to think about how you want to deal with this.
[02:22:39.150 --> 02:22:42.112]  The need to go to war is paramount.
[02:22:42.872 --> 02:22:47.395]  The bills have to be paid to the globalists, and so the war
[02:22:48.614 --> 02:22:57.879]  The wars are happening, the bankruptcies are happening, the hyperinflation is happening, and the vortex has opened up and it's swallowing all decency.
[02:22:58.479 --> 02:23:01.620]  And the only thing left are the money printers and the devils.
[02:23:02.221 --> 02:23:04.622]  So, you know, you have to plan accordingly.
[02:23:05.022 --> 02:23:05.802]  It's pretty obvious.
[02:23:05.862 --> 02:23:11.125]  I don't see... I mean, getting back to the assassination attempt, it was a shocking and blatant public
[02:23:11.705 --> 02:23:12.525]  We're good to go.
[02:23:41.374 --> 02:23:44.958]  That the U.S.
[02:23:45.478 --> 02:23:48.762]  would stage an assassination like that.
[02:23:48.822 --> 02:23:53.046]  I guess it's because there was never real any accountability for the JFK assassination.
[02:23:53.406 --> 02:23:55.569]  There was no accountability for the COVID hoax.
[02:23:55.929 --> 02:24:01.194]  There was no accountability for any of the things that have happened over the past few decades.
[02:24:01.374 --> 02:24:02.516]  Everyone got away with it.
[02:24:02.996 --> 02:24:04.337]  So they keep raising the bar.
[02:24:05.138 --> 02:24:09.962]  And now they have literally put everyone's life and livelihood at risk.
[02:24:10.542 --> 02:24:22.871]  Literally, they've put 330 million lives at risk by waving a red flag at Russia, Iran, China, by starting a proxy war in the Middle East.
[02:24:23.931 --> 02:24:25.672]  You know, these guys are out there.
[02:24:25.732 --> 02:24:26.433]  They are.
[02:24:26.553 --> 02:24:27.593]  It's a horror movie.
[02:24:27.733 --> 02:24:29.715]  It's a horror movie unfolding before our eyes.
[02:24:29.755 --> 02:24:33.377]  So, you know, in the horror movie, there's always somebody who's like, you know, this doesn't look too good.
[02:24:33.837 --> 02:24:36.799]  And they get out, you know, like the Blair Witch Project or something.
[02:24:36.819 --> 02:24:37.420]  They leave.
[02:24:37.480 --> 02:24:38.741]  It's like, this doesn't look good.
[02:24:39.541 --> 02:24:45.845]  And for me, I'm like, you know, I'm happy to go to El Salvador and build a Bitcoin country.
[02:24:45.885 --> 02:24:47.166]  They made Bitcoin legal tender.
[02:24:47.859 --> 02:24:52.001]  The President Bukele is the sharpest, smartest leader in the world.
[02:24:52.161 --> 02:24:53.822]  He's carrying the torch of freedom.
[02:24:54.202 --> 02:24:56.744]  The Statue of Liberty is now a volcano in El Salvador.
[02:24:57.665 --> 02:25:04.168]  If you want to live in a country of economic freedom, with a leader that is helping and responding to the people, move to El Salvador!
[02:25:04.888 --> 02:25:08.510]  And, you know, that's where America is now.
[02:25:08.590 --> 02:25:10.331]  America is now in El Salvador.
[02:25:10.471 --> 02:25:14.793]  It's no longer between the two oceans, Canada and Mexico.
[02:25:14.853 --> 02:25:19.275]  That landmass has now effectively been destroyed.
[02:25:19.495 --> 02:25:19.755]  It's gone.
[02:25:19.775 --> 02:25:22.016]  So it's not actually... No, but I agree with you.
[02:25:22.056 --> 02:25:24.357]  So what do you make of Kamala Harris not being able to talk?
[02:25:25.257 --> 02:25:30.362]  Uh, this new, uh, Tim Walz and all his bizarre statements about communism being good.
[02:25:30.902 --> 02:25:32.784]  I mean, how could they come up with bigger clowns?
[02:25:33.505 --> 02:25:39.851]  These people, like, if I was trying to find somebody this revolting, why is the power structure picking such revolting people?
[02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:42.621]  It's easier to sell that.
[02:25:43.322 --> 02:25:45.164]  It's marketing 101.
[02:25:45.705 --> 02:25:49.108]  You buy the sizzle, not the steak.
[02:25:49.649 --> 02:25:53.854]  You are sold stuff that you shouldn't be buying all the time.
[02:25:53.914 --> 02:25:57.658]  If you knew the actual ingredients, you wouldn't be buying half the stuff you're buying.
[02:25:58.158 --> 02:25:58.338]  Right.
[02:25:58.398 --> 02:26:04.502]  So if they if Kamala talks, if she does real interviews, et cetera, then people would not like what they hear.
[02:26:04.542 --> 02:26:16.349]  So they have to keep the illusion going that she's an unknown quantity and that so people will project their insecurities onto her and say that they're going to she's going to help them.
[02:26:17.229 --> 02:26:21.190]  That was my next question, so let's look at some of these headlines here.
[02:26:41.076 --> 02:26:44.320]  They want him arrested in Brazil, they want him arrested in the EU, now the UK.
[02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:46.802]  He's pointing out that Kamala Harris is a communist.
[02:26:47.683 --> 02:26:49.885]  What are they going to do with the wild card of Elon Musk?
[02:26:51.744 --> 02:26:54.225]  Well, you know, God may be on our side.
[02:26:54.265 --> 02:27:06.371]  So between Elon and Trump and President Bukele and a few other people, maybe the end of the story will be a shining moment of clarity and we make it to the other side of this madness.
[02:27:07.092 --> 02:27:16.196]  But they obviously don't like to have any accountability whatsoever and Elon Musk is forcing people to have some accountability.
[02:27:16.477 --> 02:27:18.718]  It was quite shocking to them because he took over
[02:27:19.298 --> 02:27:19.418]  Yeah.
[02:27:19.438 --> 02:27:23.042]  And so it shows you what one man can do, you know, with a vision and the genius.
[02:27:23.062 --> 02:27:24.203]  I mean, he's without a doubt
[02:27:40.171 --> 02:27:45.438]  Probably an engineering genius on the scale of Leonardo da Vinci or Michelangelo.
[02:27:45.458 --> 02:27:48.903]  Folks could deny he was a maverick before.
[02:27:49.264 --> 02:27:51.066]  They can't deny the stuff now.
[02:27:52.199 --> 02:27:56.683]  Yeah, I mean, just listen to him free associate engineering concepts on, like, the Rogan Show.
[02:27:56.783 --> 02:28:00.346]  Like, you know, how would you build a, you know, a tunnel between here and Mars or something?
[02:28:00.366 --> 02:28:04.610]  He'd be like, well, he can, like, put it in his brain and come up with an actual answer.
[02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:06.471]  And you think, oh, that couldn't possibly work.
[02:28:06.511 --> 02:28:13.938]  And then two weeks later, he's got the super mega rocket, you know, landing back on a small raft in the middle of the ocean.
[02:28:13.958 --> 02:28:17.341]  You're like, well, this guy is like the Da Vinci of our time.
[02:28:18.001 --> 02:28:27.389]  So, if anyone, is the timing of his appearance and what's happened with the bullet-missing Trump, is all this divine intervention?
[02:28:27.429 --> 02:28:31.952]  Is it just God putting on the greatest show on Earth?
[02:28:32.153 --> 02:28:34.574]  You know, God loves to be entertained as well.
[02:28:34.855 --> 02:28:43.241]  Maybe he's just like, I'm going to bring it all the way down to the last possible second, and then we're going to, you know, flip-pivot into the saving.
[02:28:43.522 --> 02:28:45.343]  Let me ask you this.
[02:28:45.964 --> 02:28:47.085]  I hate to be macabre here,
[02:28:48.024 --> 02:28:51.947]  But what would have happened if they killed Trump, looking at a crystal ball, on the 13th of July?
[02:28:52.027 --> 02:28:53.528]  If they'd have blown his head off, what would have happened?
[02:28:55.529 --> 02:29:01.293]  Well, we would all be in that shock, as we already talked about it.
[02:29:01.433 --> 02:29:09.538]  They would rush through an enormous amount of legislation that would have put us under- They would have blamed Iran, probably hit Iran.
[02:29:13.123 --> 02:29:18.808]  Yeah, when you're in shock like that, people would listen to anything and anything.
[02:29:19.168 --> 02:29:22.791]  You become very primal and feral.
[02:29:22.931 --> 02:29:25.854]  It's like, I just want to make sure I have something to eat.
[02:29:26.054 --> 02:29:27.135]  You're not going to be looking for
[02:29:28.616 --> 02:29:29.437]  Any explanations?
[02:29:29.477 --> 02:29:30.378]  You're like you're scared.
[02:29:30.418 --> 02:29:31.739]  You're scared to death, essentially.
[02:29:31.799 --> 02:29:32.299]  Everyone would be.
[02:29:32.319 --> 02:29:33.540]  I would be scared.
[02:29:33.580 --> 02:29:41.427]  I mean, I personally, you know, would have been scared just to have that actually witnessed that and understand that it was a freaking coup.
[02:29:41.947 --> 02:29:44.429]  And it would be frightening, you know, to me.
[02:29:44.509 --> 02:29:47.472]  And the banks would probably shut down and all these things would happen.
[02:29:47.512 --> 02:29:49.614]  And everything is very fragile in terms of the economy.
[02:29:49.654 --> 02:29:50.855]  It's all very highly leveraged.
[02:29:50.915 --> 02:29:54.398]  So any kind of tipping point would just kind of
[02:29:55.158 --> 02:30:00.100]  Um, shut the economy down again, and they've already shown what happens when they do shut the economy down.
[02:30:00.580 --> 02:30:01.540]  And that was a beta test.
[02:30:01.580 --> 02:30:04.701]  In fact, in England, they're calling for lockdowns, the civil unrest.
[02:30:04.741 --> 02:30:08.103]  So that's a great point.
[02:30:09.063 --> 02:30:10.864]  Obviously, they're going to try to kill Trump again, then.
[02:30:11.744 --> 02:30:13.024]  How do you agree with that?
[02:30:13.184 --> 02:30:14.485]  A, B, how do we stop that?
[02:30:14.885 --> 02:30:17.706]  Elon Musk, I told Elon Musk two months ago, I said, you better get more security.
[02:30:17.726 --> 02:30:19.107]  He responded back and said, I think you're right.
[02:30:19.127 --> 02:30:20.527]  I'm going to increase my security.
[02:30:20.847 --> 02:30:22.848]  I think Elon is as big a target, maybe bigger than Trump.
[02:30:24.858 --> 02:30:42.071]  Yeah, Alex, this is one of those moments where it really does become biblical, where you are asking yourself for God's help, because we humans have gotten ourselves into
[02:30:42.911 --> 02:30:44.353]  A real big mess here.
[02:30:44.593 --> 02:30:46.855]  You know, we've gotten over over indebted.
[02:30:47.375 --> 02:30:48.636]  We've got atomic weapons.
[02:30:48.877 --> 02:30:51.659]  We've got a media that's in the service of psychopaths.
[02:30:52.260 --> 02:30:57.965]  We've got politicians that are clearly on the take of the worst elements of the globalist
[02:30:58.405 --> 02:31:00.846]  He said we all got together in the cabinet and prayed.
[02:31:27.884 --> 02:31:28.404]  We prayed.
[02:31:29.345 --> 02:31:31.247]  And he said, you know, we prayed and it worked.
[02:31:31.627 --> 02:31:36.671]  So, you know, maybe President Bukele, look to President Bukele as the leader of the free world.
[02:31:36.771 --> 02:31:37.732]  You know, what does he do?
[02:31:37.772 --> 02:31:38.512]  What is he doing?
[02:31:38.592 --> 02:31:39.653]  Well, he's praying.
[02:31:39.833 --> 02:31:40.674]  He's asking God.
[02:31:40.954 --> 02:31:42.095]  Maybe that is the answer.
[02:31:42.215 --> 02:31:46.358]  And I think it's certainly worked in El Salvador and historically.
[02:31:47.179 --> 02:31:49.761]  That's why we have the concept of God.
[02:31:49.801 --> 02:31:52.743]  You know, the concept of God has, you know, been around for a while.
[02:31:53.183 --> 02:32:00.348]  Occasionally, liberal societies turn their back on God, you know, and you have a different experience in different periods of time.
[02:32:00.549 --> 02:32:03.270]  But it comes back to it.
[02:32:03.350 --> 02:32:07.493]  If you want another historical interesting precedent, it would be Weimar Republic in their 20s in Germany when
[02:32:09.895 --> 02:32:22.058]  You had hyperinflation, and the society went into a decadent bacchanal that was really disgusting, where sex and all kinds of things were just openly on the streets.
[02:32:22.078 --> 02:32:29.419]  I mean, if you look at the gay pride parade this year, and you had men, you know, fornicating on the streets in front of kids, right?
[02:32:29.739 --> 02:32:32.420]  That's a level of decadence that is rare.
[02:32:32.480 --> 02:32:34.340]  That's always a signpost of collapse.
[02:32:34.840 --> 02:32:36.361]  Why is it always a signpost?
[02:32:39.977 --> 02:32:41.278]  Well, that was hyperinflation.
[02:32:41.338 --> 02:32:49.661]  So the hyperinflation, when you... Money is a unit of exchange and a unit of value that represents the value of society in a lot of ways.
[02:32:49.721 --> 02:33:01.306]  And during hyperinflation, where an ounce of gold went from 1 to 1 Reichmark exchange rate to something like a trillion to 1, values themselves in that society crashed.
[02:33:01.606 --> 02:33:07.009]  So these things that we would normally find abhorrent become normalized.
[02:33:07.549 --> 02:33:09.710]  And that's what we're seeing in the U.S.
[02:33:09.790 --> 02:33:19.672]  right now, is because of the inflation, because of the loss of values, the aberrant behavior that society would normally look down on is becoming normalized.
[02:33:20.133 --> 02:33:24.154]  And what happened in Germany in the 20s during that period?
[02:33:24.194 --> 02:33:27.975]  Well, there was a group of vigilantes on the street.
[02:33:28.895 --> 02:33:41.499]  Uh, who, uh, were there to restore some order and bring back some values, you know, and they metastasized into the National Socialist Party, uh, which then we gave us the World War II.
[02:33:41.959 --> 02:33:54.303]  So, you know, this is another possible outcome, is during this hyperinflation and inflationary period and, and law, utter complete loss of, of social standards, what, what will emerge from that?
[02:33:54.383 --> 02:33:56.784]  You know, a demagogue, an ideologue,
[02:33:57.504 --> 02:34:05.208]  Um, this is the brush that they're going to try to paint Trump with, but of course, you know, he is probably the opposite of that in that.
[02:34:06.148 --> 02:34:16.132]  So, but, but if you are, have, um, so many people, I'll give you another interesting chart, you know, in economics, a lot of times you find inspiration in unusual places.
[02:34:16.713 --> 02:34:21.475]  So there's a chart of the growth of antidepressants.
[02:34:21.835 --> 02:34:23.756]  You're always on fire, but you're here right now with us.
[02:34:50.092 --> 02:34:52.113]  Max Keiser talking about the epicness.
[02:34:52.133 --> 02:34:55.596]  We have millions of people tuned in right now looking at the markets.
[02:34:55.636 --> 02:34:57.037]  They can't prop it up much longer.
[02:34:57.057 --> 02:34:58.698]  They're trying to create civil war.
[02:34:58.718 --> 02:35:00.479]  You got Jamie Raskin saying we're gonna have a civil war.
[02:35:00.519 --> 02:35:02.941]  You got Democrats saying we're gonna have martial law.
[02:35:03.221 --> 02:35:04.002]  That's insane.
[02:35:04.262 --> 02:35:05.083]  That's not gonna work.
[02:35:05.143 --> 02:35:07.124]  So what are the time frames here?
[02:35:07.164 --> 02:35:12.268]  I mean, you can't put numbers on it or days on it, but you're sitting there in El Salvador watching this.
[02:35:15.150 --> 02:35:16.671]  What are the different signposts you see?
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:29.914]  Well, this November election, it would be the ultimate kind of goal line that we're shooting for here.
[02:35:30.034 --> 02:35:31.096]  Either Trump wins, or you have
[02:35:38.484 --> 02:35:43.269]  You know, I think it's well said by many, including Trump, what the alternative is.
[02:35:43.289 --> 02:35:45.031]  There is no alternative.
[02:35:45.311 --> 02:35:46.953]  Economic collapse, World War III.
[02:35:47.113 --> 02:35:48.274]  And it's really going to happen.
[02:35:48.294 --> 02:35:48.935]  It's all set up.
[02:35:49.896 --> 02:35:52.178]  Why would the establishment want World War III?
[02:35:52.198 --> 02:35:53.420]  Because they're definitely pushing for it.
[02:35:54.807 --> 02:35:55.968]  Well, look at the stock market.
[02:35:56.008 --> 02:36:00.833]  As I said a few moments ago, the defense contracting stocks are up big, right?
[02:36:00.873 --> 02:36:01.573]  There's huge money.
[02:36:02.114 --> 02:36:14.225]  And if you feel that you've created a fortress and that you're safe and your family is safe, and you can go out there and stir up a war and profit handsomely from that war, you know why you're going to do it.
[02:36:15.526 --> 02:36:16.307]  I really trace it all back to 9-11.
[02:36:16.327 --> 02:36:21.211]  I think 9-11 is the day when the establishment in the United States, the elite as they're called in the United States, the wealthy
[02:36:34.377 --> 02:36:38.598]  They've decided to take as much as they possibly can and run for the hills.
[02:36:39.498 --> 02:36:41.018]  And they have gutted the economy.
[02:36:41.378 --> 02:36:42.938]  And they don't care if it collapses.
[02:36:42.998 --> 02:36:51.280]  They've got their 300-foot yachts out in the Mediterranean, their chateaus in Switzerland, and they're just looting wholesale for the last 24 years.
[02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:52.620]  And everything's been stolen.
[02:36:53.100 --> 02:36:59.101]  And in San Francisco, they say, oh, the looters can take up to $900 worth of goods and we won't prosecute them for looting.
[02:36:59.521 --> 02:37:03.202]  Well, that's because the laws that were passed to make that possible are from people
[02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:05.630]  Who are looting billions of dollars.
[02:37:06.091 --> 02:37:08.972]  And they're putting those away very safely way offshore.
[02:37:09.612 --> 02:37:12.173]  And that's the mentality now in the U.S.
[02:37:12.193 --> 02:37:12.673]  The U.S.
[02:37:12.933 --> 02:37:18.715]  since 9-11 is a country that has no stewardship.
[02:37:19.095 --> 02:37:19.975]  There's nobody in charge.
[02:37:19.995 --> 02:37:20.795]  Hasn't been in charge.
[02:37:20.855 --> 02:37:21.756]  It's a runaway train.
[02:37:21.796 --> 02:37:25.957]  But don't the globals feel danger getting rid of any checks and balances?
[02:37:28.223 --> 02:37:32.366]  Well, again, another theme I talk about is the return of feudalism.
[02:37:32.586 --> 02:37:36.689]  So it's not about even having a high concentration of wealthy.
[02:37:36.729 --> 02:37:39.170]  It's about having lords and serfs.
[02:37:39.250 --> 02:37:46.195]  It's about having maybe 500 families on planet Earth with 99.999% of the wealth.
[02:37:46.555 --> 02:37:49.057]  And everyone else is essentially in the casino gulag.
[02:37:49.117 --> 02:37:50.718]  Everyone else is a serf.
[02:37:51.158 --> 02:37:57.663]  So they see feudalism is a form of governance that was very popular if you're a monarch.
[02:37:58.583 --> 02:38:10.971]  And what happened during the plague years of the 1400s, they wiped out half the population of Europe and then suddenly the elites to get to work the land, they had to pay people.
[02:38:11.192 --> 02:38:18.957]  And that was the beginning of the merchant class or the middle class, which went on for the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the American Revolution, and became the
[02:38:19.697 --> 02:38:21.238]  They don't want any competition.
[02:38:21.318 --> 02:38:23.398]  So in closing, we've got like seven minutes left.
[02:38:49.273 --> 02:38:52.416]  Bitcoin, the economy, what are you betting on?
[02:38:52.536 --> 02:38:55.218]  Any other key points you wish you would have added after you leave?
[02:38:56.359 --> 02:38:58.941]  Well, everything goes to zero against Bitcoin.
[02:38:59.081 --> 02:39:00.242]  And, you know, what do I mean by that?
[02:39:00.322 --> 02:39:02.304]  I mean that in terms of purchasing power.
[02:39:02.844 --> 02:39:06.868]  So your purchasing power of your dollar, obviously, is going to go down versus Bitcoin.
[02:39:07.248 --> 02:39:17.817]  But your purchasing power in terms of gold, property, fine art, your business, stocks, bonds, everything, the purchasing power of everything relative to Bitcoin is going to go down.
[02:39:18.397 --> 02:39:26.648]  Because it's only a $1.2 trillion asset in a world of $400 trillion worth of financial assets, financialized assets.
[02:39:26.668 --> 02:39:32.676]  And just like software ate the world during the 70s and 80s, and every company in the world became essentially a software company.
[02:39:32.696 --> 02:39:35.880]  You know, car companies are a software company, airlines are a software company.
[02:39:36.820 --> 02:39:39.823]  All value will become priced in Bitcoin.
[02:39:39.943 --> 02:39:42.385]  Everything will be priced in Bitcoin, particularly energy.
[02:39:42.405 --> 02:39:52.513]  I would say the next big prediction, I'll make a prediction here, is that within 24 months, all the major global energy contracts will be priced in Bitcoin, not dollars.
[02:39:53.054 --> 02:39:59.599]  And that will be the end of the fiat money world, as we know it officially, and the beginning of the Bitcoin epoch.
[02:40:00.459 --> 02:40:01.801]  What comes after Bitcoin?
[02:40:04.025 --> 02:40:09.867]  Well, what comes after it is the demonetization of violence and the monetization of love.
[02:40:10.948 --> 02:40:17.491]  Not to get too freaking over-the-top crazy, Alex, but I really do liken it to like a Christ 2.0.
[02:40:18.291 --> 02:40:29.736]  It's a story about love, where if you cannot steal somebody's wealth through violence because Bitcoin is unconfiscatable, you can only approach people with the intention of fair trade.
[02:40:30.456 --> 02:40:36.444]  And that demonetizes violence and the profound quality of this is what happened in El Salvador.
[02:40:36.464 --> 02:40:43.793]  They made Bitcoin legal tender and within three months, the president put 70,000 gangsters in jail because Bitcoin makes you think differently.
[02:40:43.813 --> 02:40:45.435]  You know, you don't change Bitcoin.
[02:40:45.475 --> 02:40:46.477]  Bitcoin changes you.
[02:40:47.282 --> 02:40:52.543]  And this is what the world has on the other side of this fiat money collapse.
[02:40:52.623 --> 02:41:02.566]  If we get there, if we survive the next 24 months in the fiat money collapse, we will wake up as a global Bitcoin standard and a moment of Christ-like universal love.
[02:41:02.766 --> 02:41:03.466]  If we can get there.
[02:41:03.506 --> 02:41:05.066]  We got to get through the next 24 months.
[02:41:05.146 --> 02:41:06.327]  We got to get Trump in office.
[02:41:06.807 --> 02:41:08.467]  We have to defeat the global bankers.
[02:41:11.608 --> 02:41:11.808]  Hello?
[02:41:14.008 --> 02:41:15.089]  I'm listening to you right now.
[02:41:15.369 --> 02:41:20.512]  It's just very profound to see this unfolding.
[02:41:21.032 --> 02:41:22.213]  What happens in the Ukraine war?
[02:41:22.253 --> 02:41:24.014]  What happens, do you think, with Israel and Iran right now?
[02:41:26.255 --> 02:41:42.384]  Well, Ukraine, under Victoria Nuland, was a coup in 2014, and it was an invalidation of all the post-war treaties that were made with Russia, as they never said NATO would expand east, and of course that was never kept.
[02:41:43.691 --> 02:41:49.956]  And by NATO, and so they encroached essentially too close to Russia.
[02:41:50.056 --> 02:41:56.481]  You know, Russia, put into this context, Russia and Iran are not part of the global banking system.
[02:41:57.442 --> 02:42:09.611]  Okay, when you talk about the global derivatives market and the Ponzi scheme that is fiat money and how it's relating to the yen carry trade, two big exceptions would be Russia and Iran.
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:18.827]  In my view, the reason why Russia and Iran are in conflict with everybody else is really a conflict between a hard money economy.
[02:42:18.887 --> 02:42:25.613]  Russia is the biggest commodity producers in the world with very little debt, and Iran is a huge energy producer.
[02:42:25.653 --> 02:42:27.775]  But theologically and whatever, they have a history.
[02:42:27.795 --> 02:42:29.216]  They're not part of the U.S.
[02:42:29.297 --> 02:42:29.597]  scheme.
[02:42:30.017 --> 02:42:31.358]  But nevertheless, so you have
[02:42:32.609 --> 02:42:34.009]  That's where this war is.
[02:42:34.029 --> 02:42:36.150]  That's the demarcation of this war.
[02:42:36.290 --> 02:42:40.351]  It's about hard assets versus funny money, Wall Street assets.
[02:42:41.071 --> 02:42:45.412]  And so Russia, you know, it's like rock, paper, scissors.
[02:42:45.432 --> 02:42:46.993]  You know that game, rock, paper, scissors?
[02:42:47.333 --> 02:42:50.594]  Well, you know, if you look at it like this, Russia has
[02:42:52.274 --> 02:42:54.915]  Sure, so is the arrogance of the globalists put on, or do they really think they're winning?
[02:42:54.955 --> 02:42:57.075]  Because you can clearly see they're losing.
[02:43:13.380 --> 02:43:18.661]  Well, I think, you know, they say never get high on your own supply, right?
[02:43:18.781 --> 02:43:21.482]  I mean, or Tony Montana or somebody like that.
[02:43:23.383 --> 02:43:26.843]  The globalists are smelling their own flatulence, right?
[02:43:26.923 --> 02:43:30.684]  And they think it smells like Dior, Christian Dior, right?
[02:43:30.724 --> 02:43:32.345]  They're high on their own delusions.
[02:43:32.385 --> 02:43:33.905]  They've got a God complex.
[02:43:34.365 --> 02:43:36.626]  Again, God is not in the room.
[02:43:37.378 --> 02:43:41.303]  Because these globalists think they're God, right?
[02:43:42.745 --> 02:43:45.829]  So they have a God complex.
[02:43:45.869 --> 02:43:49.693]  They really believe that they're doing righteous things by
[02:43:51.058 --> 02:44:01.725]  By undermining human values and human rights, and by imposing their dictatorial, communist-like, neo-feudal casino gulags.
[02:44:01.745 --> 02:44:03.886]  Because they say, we have the power, we have a right to do it.
[02:44:04.306 --> 02:44:05.987]  But don't they see the whole world turning against them?
[02:44:06.007 --> 02:44:08.149]  All these attorney generals are going after BlackRock?
[02:44:10.330 --> 02:44:14.432]  No, because they would position themselves as victims, of course.
[02:44:14.933 --> 02:44:19.996]  The dictators are always pushing the line that they are the victim, like Maduro.
[02:44:20.814 --> 02:44:22.735]  In Venezuela, right?
[02:44:22.875 --> 02:44:26.736]  He stole an election and he's saying I'm the victim.
[02:44:27.797 --> 02:44:32.698]  I'm suffering so much from all of you people questioning the fact that I'm such a fantastic leader.
[02:44:33.359 --> 02:44:35.499]  So he's like a tin-pot dictator.
[02:44:35.539 --> 02:44:41.722]  He's a low-rent dictator, whereas someone like a Bill Gates is like a Maduro of technology.
[02:44:41.762 --> 02:44:42.682]  You know, he's a smoother digital
[02:44:45.223 --> 02:44:45.703]  I agree.
[02:44:45.723 --> 02:44:51.525]  We had Warren Buffett getting out of Bill Gates three months ago and Buffett dumping all that stock.
[02:44:51.606 --> 02:44:53.706]  We got Buffett running from Gates.
[02:45:10.345 --> 02:45:14.587]  Well, I mean, OK, we're talking Apple versus Microsoft, which is a slightly different case.
[02:45:14.627 --> 02:45:17.108]  But clearly Buffett is raising cash.
[02:45:17.848 --> 02:45:21.510]  And, you know, Buffett said famously, he says a lot of famous things.
[02:45:21.590 --> 02:45:23.650]  One of the things he said was never sell America short.
[02:45:24.131 --> 02:45:26.472]  But apparently he is now selling America short.
[02:45:26.532 --> 02:45:28.312]  So he's had a big change of heart.
[02:45:28.332 --> 02:45:29.233]  Hold on, do five more minutes.
[02:45:29.293 --> 02:45:31.173]  Max Keiser, MaxKeiser.com.
[02:45:31.814 --> 02:45:37.176]  Five more minutes on the economy, on the stock market, on what just happened with Apple and his predictions.
[02:45:37.216 --> 02:45:38.416]  Five more minutes with Max Keiser.
[02:45:38.877 --> 02:45:39.197]  And then?
[02:45:39.997 --> 02:45:41.577]  Special guest host takes over.
[02:45:41.977 --> 02:45:43.478]  This is really important stuff.
[02:45:43.518 --> 02:45:44.678]  Max Keiser is on fire.
[02:45:45.378 --> 02:46:08.742]  Be sure and follow him on Orange Pill on YouTube and Max Keiser on X. I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements.
[02:46:09.721 --> 02:46:16.144]  Because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up, and it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[02:46:16.965 --> 02:46:32.013]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking, some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[02:46:32.373 --> 02:46:34.234]  We had five companies making product for us.
[02:46:34.855 --> 02:46:39.337]  Three of them notified us that, we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're InfoWars.
[02:46:40.074 --> 02:46:45.738]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[02:46:45.758 --> 02:46:48.620]  Not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[02:46:49.441 --> 02:47:02.871]  And they said, listen, you know we were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label
[02:47:04.131 --> 02:47:08.172]  On our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[02:47:08.573 --> 02:47:11.874]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup.
[02:47:11.914 --> 02:47:18.676]  And I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling our products and a lot of the products that we developed.
[02:47:19.356 --> 02:47:27.219]  But so many of these products that they had put out, again, were the exact same thing that we were putting out.
[02:47:28.217 --> 02:47:36.321]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we're even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[02:47:36.401 --> 02:47:43.045]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[02:47:43.205 --> 02:47:45.686]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[02:47:45.866 --> 02:47:47.787]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[02:47:47.987 --> 02:47:57.755]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[02:47:58.375 --> 02:48:00.777]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[02:48:00.837 --> 02:48:01.898]  Take Turmeric 95.
[02:48:03.579 --> 02:48:10.281]  Turmeric 95 is called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[02:48:10.401 --> 02:48:16.043]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[02:48:16.163 --> 02:48:24.665]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[02:48:24.725 --> 02:48:26.826]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[02:48:27.046 --> 02:48:27.166]  And
[02:48:28.433 --> 02:48:41.726]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[02:48:42.227 --> 02:48:46.611]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[02:48:46.671 --> 02:48:51.316]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[02:48:52.337 --> 02:48:57.560]  So I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[02:48:57.660 --> 02:48:58.261]  It's amazing.
[02:48:58.401 --> 02:48:59.321]  It's super high quality.
[02:48:59.381 --> 02:49:01.243]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[02:49:21.556 --> 02:49:22.036]  Thank you.
[02:49:50.566 --> 02:49:54.809]  Mike Adams in six minutes is set to take over in the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:49:54.829 --> 02:49:55.470]  He's loaded for bear.
[02:49:55.490 --> 02:49:56.511]  You don't want to miss it.
[02:49:58.813 --> 02:50:02.395]  You can go on for a long time.
[02:50:03.016 --> 02:50:05.238]  Run on for a long time.
[02:50:05.978 --> 02:50:08.160]  Run on for a long time.
[02:50:08.760 --> 02:50:11.182]  Sooner or later, gonna cut you down.
[02:50:11.783 --> 02:50:14.145]  Sooner or later, gonna cut you down.
[02:50:14.946 --> 02:50:16.728]  So Max, finishing up, we appreciate your time.
[02:50:17.389 --> 02:50:21.234]  Max Keiser on YouTube, OrangePill, at Max Keiser on Axe.
[02:50:23.557 --> 02:50:29.584]  Looking at, did Buffett call the top of the market or did he cause the end of the market?
[02:50:30.145 --> 02:50:30.926]  What do you make of that?
[02:50:33.484 --> 02:50:37.347]  I think, you know, he's getting out because stocks are overextended, right?
[02:50:37.387 --> 02:50:39.148]  Their valuations are high.
[02:50:40.069 --> 02:50:46.134]  And so he's a guy who has already stated what metrics he would look at to raise cash.
[02:50:46.234 --> 02:50:54.561]  There's nothing compelling for him to buy because things are overpriced and you have companies trading at levels that are historically very high.
[02:50:55.301 --> 02:51:00.045]  And so he's raising cash and he's a bellwether.
[02:51:00.385 --> 02:51:04.248]  So other people in the money management business are going to follow what Warren Buffett does.
[02:51:04.348 --> 02:51:10.251]  So there is a compounding effect and you do have people walking away from the stock market.
[02:51:10.291 --> 02:51:21.759]  If you look at some of the data, for example, what's called breadth in the market, not breath, but breadth with a D. This is the number of stocks making new highs versus new lows.
[02:51:22.519 --> 02:51:27.261]  And it gives you an indication of internally what are people really thinking about the stock market.
[02:51:27.321 --> 02:51:34.904]  And last week you had the highest number of stocks making new lows relative to new highs you've had probably ever.
[02:51:35.464 --> 02:51:39.825]  And it just shows you that the conviction of the people in the market is low.
[02:51:40.125 --> 02:51:47.128]  There's only maybe seven stocks, the magnificent seven, and they account for something like 25 to 30 percent of the movement of the overall market.
[02:51:47.148 --> 02:51:49.729]  Their market capitalizations are in the multi-trillion dollar level.
[02:51:50.945 --> 02:52:04.329]  And just like in 1987 or the dot-com era in 2001, once confidence shifts away from that very highly concentrated group of popular stocks, it can take the entire market down.
[02:52:04.389 --> 02:52:12.712]  As it did in 1987, which I know very well because I was a stockbroker at that time, or in 2001 during the dot-com crash, I know very well because I had a dot-com company.
[02:52:13.372 --> 02:52:16.394]  And so you can get a 25, 30, 40 percent markdown very quickly.
[02:52:16.454 --> 02:52:30.304]  What this has is it cuts into people's ability to spend money because although the economy kind of sinks and like fast food restaurants are cutting back, there are millions of people in the United States and around the world.
[02:52:30.324 --> 02:52:33.827]  There are something like 50 million millionaires in the world.
[02:52:34.659 --> 02:52:36.740]  Don't quote me on that number, but something on that scale.
[02:52:37.240 --> 02:52:39.241]  And a lot of their wealth is tied to the stock market.
[02:52:39.281 --> 02:52:51.348]  So when Microsoft or Nvidia or Apple stock is trading at multi-trillion dollar levels, you know, there are millions of people in America with a 401k plan or a stock account, a Schwab that have 5, 10, 15 million bucks in those accounts.
[02:52:51.488 --> 02:52:53.789]  And they built it up over the boomers.
[02:52:53.829 --> 02:53:00.092]  And like me, over 20, 30 years, you know, I bought Berkshire Hathaway stock in my IRA in 1980.
[02:53:02.413 --> 02:53:06.094]  Uh, three at something like $2,000 a share, right?
[02:53:07.055 --> 02:53:09.596]  It's in the multi-hundreds, $1,000 per share now.
[02:53:10.136 --> 02:53:21.340]  And so, but when, so when you, when the market crashes, like we saw, saw this in 2008, when you had a big market crash, you know, the Porsche dealers report overnight that sales have stopped to a dead stop, right?
[02:53:21.420 --> 02:53:23.200]  It's just, it comes to a dead stop.
[02:53:23.681 --> 02:53:27.362]  And, and so then the Fed comes in and they try to reinflate the bubble.
[02:53:27.782 --> 02:53:32.404]  They've been doing this now since Alan Greenspan of the 80s and under Ronald Reagan.
[02:53:32.424 --> 02:53:42.669]  He became the activist fed who's decided that they were going to make the stock market go higher and that's what they've been doing through Greenspan all the way up to the current Jay Powell.
[02:53:43.090 --> 02:53:51.574]  But it is an enormous Ponzi scheme because the underlying economy doesn't generate enough taxes to pay the debt that they issued to float that amount of currency.
[02:53:52.014 --> 02:54:12.234]  So it's just a matter of time, and with the yen carry trade now collapsing, which is the base layer of the global derivatives Ponzi scheme, we may in fact be looking at a 150 to 200 trillion dollar crash of the global economies of the world, which would put 85% of the world's population into insolvency.
[02:54:12.895 --> 02:54:14.717]  That is not going to be a pretty picture, Alex.
[02:54:16.246 --> 02:54:17.827]  Max Keiser, thank you so much.
[02:54:17.867 --> 02:54:19.649]  Can't wait to come see you soon in El Salvador.
[02:54:20.429 --> 02:54:21.030]  God bless you.
[02:54:21.070 --> 02:54:21.690]  Thanks for the time.
[02:54:23.632 --> 02:54:25.633]  Until next time, buy Bitcoin!
[02:54:26.254 --> 02:54:26.654]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:27.455 --> 02:54:27.935]  All right.
[02:54:28.956 --> 02:54:31.358]  Mike Adams is loaded up and ready to go.
[02:54:31.798 --> 02:54:32.819]  He's about to take over.
[02:54:32.859 --> 02:54:37.623]  Then, in 55 minutes, Owen Schroyer, The War Room, 3 p.m.
[02:54:37.703 --> 02:54:38.704]  Central today.
[02:54:39.084 --> 02:54:40.685]  Please follow me on X at RealAlexJones.
[02:54:41.366 --> 02:54:43.267]  Mike Adams takes over in 60 seconds.
[02:54:43.287 --> 02:54:43.668]  Stay with us.
[02:54:44.128 --> 02:54:48.991]  So they always tell you it's the most important election of your lifetime, but of course this one actually is.
[02:54:49.051 --> 02:54:54.253]  That's demonstrable and it's also because it is so important being censored at every level by the tech companies.
[02:54:54.954 --> 02:55:04.739]  We were thinking about this a couple of months ago and we thought why not get on the road live in front of actual people, live audiences, coast to coast, a nationwide tour where we can't be censored.
[02:55:05.499 --> 02:55:06.040]  That'd be good.
[02:55:06.180 --> 02:55:07.041]  It would also be fun.
[02:55:07.061 --> 02:55:07.701]  So we're doing it.
[02:55:07.721 --> 02:55:18.071]  We're going to be on stage with some of our friends, some of the most fascinating people we know, the most recognizable people we know, responding to what is happening in America this September in real time.
[02:55:18.976 --> 02:55:21.198]  It'll be just like the podcast, but it's gonna be live.
[02:55:21.799 --> 02:55:26.384]  So we're excited to announce our friend Larry Elder is coming to join us in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
[02:55:26.404 --> 02:55:29.748]  Our friend John Rich will be there with us in Sunrise, Florida.
[02:55:29.768 --> 02:55:30.709]  We're adding more stops.
[02:55:30.729 --> 02:55:33.652]  We just added another stadium show in Redding, Pennsylvania.
[02:55:34.052 --> 02:55:36.355]  We'll be joined on stage by Alex Jones.
[02:55:36.395 --> 02:55:37.796]  They tell you what Alex Jones is like.
[02:55:37.997 --> 02:55:38.938]  Have you seen him in person?
[02:55:38.958 --> 02:55:39.538]  You should.
[02:55:40.019 --> 02:55:40.820]  Make up your own mind.
[02:55:41.421 --> 02:55:46.093]  It's going to be fun as hell and interesting and intense, and we hope you will join us.
[02:55:46.454 --> 02:55:49.341]  Go to TuckerCarlson.com right now to get your tickets.
[02:55:49.682 --> 02:55:50.023]  See you there.
[02:55:56.957 --> 02:55:59.178]  All right, an outstanding event there from Tucker Carlson.
[02:55:59.218 --> 02:56:00.098]  Folks, you don't want to miss that.
[02:56:00.298 --> 02:56:01.719]  Welcome back to the show.
[02:56:01.759 --> 02:56:08.962]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, and I'm Mike Adams, the health ranger here from Brighton and Natural News.
[02:56:09.642 --> 02:56:10.763]  You know my work, probably.
[02:56:10.783 --> 02:56:15.205]  I want to tell you, I've got Clay Clark coming up at the bottom of this hour as our special guest.
[02:56:15.265 --> 02:56:18.246]  He's the coordinator of the Reawaken America Tours.
[02:56:19.126 --> 02:56:31.050]  And we've got a lot to talk about, especially Walz, the VP pick for Kamala, or Kamala, excuse me, I'm still struggling with the correct pronunciation, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.
[02:56:31.850 --> 02:56:36.571]  And hey, wasn't it the Democrats who told us that Walz don't work all these years?
[02:56:36.631 --> 02:56:41.573]  I thought they said Walz don't work, and now I guess the Walz are closing in or something like that.
[02:56:42.033 --> 02:56:43.393]  Talk about Walz here coming up.
[02:56:44.534 --> 02:56:45.474]  And in addition to that,
[02:56:46.192 --> 02:56:48.973]  We've got a lot of breaking news and analysis.
[02:56:49.013 --> 02:56:58.196]  I've got some new intel coming from some of my military contacts about orders affecting the 82nd and 101st Airborne.
[02:56:58.876 --> 02:57:08.080]  There's been a widespread alert in military circles to be ready for deployment in case Iran launches missiles against Israel.
[02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:12.121]  You've seen the House Speaker Johnson say that if Israel is attacked,
[02:57:12.581 --> 02:57:16.022]  Then the United States will declare war on Iran.
[02:57:16.802 --> 02:57:21.383]  And it's not clear to me what exactly he means by that, or if all of Congress would support that.
[02:57:21.443 --> 02:57:21.903]  I doubt it.
[02:57:22.943 --> 02:57:24.824]  Or even if the White House would support that.
[02:57:25.604 --> 02:57:28.845]  But clearly, tensions are heightened right now.
[02:57:28.905 --> 02:57:30.445]  We're entering a very dangerous time.
[02:57:30.945 --> 02:57:33.786]  And Iran is being given weapons by Russia.
[02:57:34.666 --> 02:57:39.267]  Advanced weapons, ballistic missiles, and apparently Iskander missiles, and much more.
[02:57:40.362 --> 02:57:45.670]  Things are going to get very tenuous and dangerous here very quickly.
[02:57:46.150 --> 02:57:50.817]  And I'd like to also ask the producers there to bring up a map of the Strait of Hormuz.
[02:57:51.478 --> 02:57:56.245]  So if you look at the Strait of Hormuz on a southern portion of the Iranian coastline there,
[02:57:57.208 --> 02:58:03.010]  And then also, of course, the northern tip of the UAE with Oman to the east of that.
[02:58:03.610 --> 02:58:10.692]  If you look at this map, sorry to spring that on you last minute, you look at this map, the Strait of Hormuz is very, very narrow right there.
[02:58:11.232 --> 02:58:23.236]  And of course, a tremendous portion of the energy that is shipped to the West, including to Western Europe, moves through the Strait of Hormuz, H-O-R-M-U-Z, if you all want to look it up.
[02:58:23.979 --> 02:58:27.761]  Now, Iran has absolute control over the Strait of Hormuz.
[02:58:27.801 --> 02:58:29.582]  You've heard Alex talk about it and others.
[02:58:30.282 --> 02:58:34.224]  The thing to note about this strait is that it's so narrow.
[02:58:34.244 --> 02:58:35.825]  And there it is.
[02:58:35.905 --> 02:58:39.387]  It's kind of the upward curvy portion of this map.
[02:58:39.407 --> 02:58:42.948]  You can see it's on sort of the right quadrant.
[02:58:43.148 --> 02:58:44.129]  Yeah, thank you for zooming in.
[02:58:45.166 --> 02:58:46.667]  You can see that it's very narrow.
[02:58:46.707 --> 02:58:48.729]  Now, you may not even know how narrow this is.
[02:58:49.190 --> 02:58:56.636]  There are actually, it's only about roughly 12 to 15 miles wide at its narrowest point in there.
[02:58:57.037 --> 02:59:02.361]  And there are two shipping lanes that go through there, one going east and one going west.
[02:59:02.401 --> 02:59:06.645]  And those two shipping lanes are each only about two miles wide each, right?
[02:59:07.106 --> 02:59:09.167]  And then between them, there's a two-mile buffer zone.
[02:59:09.708 --> 02:59:11.690]  So there's only actually six miles
[02:59:12.313 --> 02:59:25.025]  That comprises the traffic lanes, like the highways in the ocean, that connect the Persian Gulf to the rest of the world, to all the export pathways, the Gulf of Oman, as you can see there.
[02:59:26.226 --> 02:59:31.771]  Now, this is going to be incredibly easy for Iran to shut down, should they so choose.
[02:59:32.515 --> 02:59:41.759]  Now, it would be very politically difficult for them to do so because it would deprive a lot of revenues to many of the other countries in the region that depend on these energy exports for their revenues.
[02:59:41.819 --> 02:59:54.004]  However, in the case of an all-out war, Iran would have that option to shut off energy exports to the West, which would absolutely crush Western Europe.
[02:59:55.063 --> 03:00:09.891]  So Western Europe already struggling under the destruction of the Nord Stream Pipeline, which we believe was carried out by the United States military, the Navy in particular, in order to stop Gazprom from Russia from being able to export energy to Germany.
[03:00:10.586 --> 03:00:14.047]  Because that was shut down, Europe is already reeling under a lack of energy.
[03:00:14.067 --> 03:00:17.108]  And this is why Europe's economy is in absolute shambles.
[03:00:17.728 --> 03:00:21.069]  Also, of course, Europe, as you know, is right now being completely overrun.
[03:00:21.489 --> 03:00:28.431]  And the European officials, especially in the UK, have no willingness whatsoever to defend their borders, defend their culture, or defend their own people.
[03:00:28.851 --> 03:00:30.391]  It's outstanding.
[03:00:30.912 --> 03:00:33.792]  I mean, it's outlandish to watch that happening.
[03:00:35.533 --> 03:00:39.814]  If I were to use the word outstanding, I would attribute that to the fact that
[03:00:40.598 --> 03:00:54.810]  From the point of view of Islam, their people are doing an outstanding job of pushing Western Europe, while from the point of view of the West, it's outlandish that they're not willing to defend their own country, and defend their own culture, and defend their own people or their own children.
[03:00:55.031 --> 03:00:56.692]  So, it just depends on your point of view, right?
[03:00:56.912 --> 03:00:59.995]  But Islam is flooding into Western Europe.
[03:01:00.355 --> 03:01:04.399]  Western Europe's economy is crumbling because of the energy losses.
[03:01:05.245 --> 03:01:24.530]  The United States military took out the Nord Stream pipelines, and now if Israel launches a preemptive strike against Iran, which they're threatening to do, or if they attack Hezbollah in Lebanon with another preemptive strike, then we could be drawn into a conflict where energy exports are extremely limited from that entire region.
[03:01:25.521 --> 03:01:47.825]  And given the fact that the Biden administration has shot down domestic energy production in the United States, taking us away from the energy independence that we had under Trump, then the United States would find itself reeling with outrageous energy prices and outrageous food inflation, and a difficulty with transportation and farming, you know, because of rising diesel prices.
[03:01:48.745 --> 03:01:53.426]  The fuel that powers the barges that ship many of our goods up and down the rivers of America.
[03:01:54.520 --> 03:01:59.507]  And many other areas of even air transportation and so on would all be impacted.
[03:01:59.988 --> 03:02:07.218]  So this is why the US State Department right now under Biden is practically begging Iran not to attack Israel.
[03:02:07.972 --> 03:02:13.496]  The back channels, those discussions that are happening right now are off the charts insane.
[03:02:13.656 --> 03:02:18.280]  The White House is, I'm told, promising all kinds of things to Iran.
[03:02:18.720 --> 03:02:20.522]  Don't attack, don't attack Israel.
[03:02:21.042 --> 03:02:22.243]  We'll give you whatever you want.
[03:02:22.263 --> 03:02:26.847]  It's almost like Iran has the US State Department held hostage in essence.
[03:02:27.607 --> 03:02:32.871]  But the US State Department is offering to drop all economic sanctions, I'm told, from Iran.
[03:02:33.752 --> 03:02:35.994]  I mean, to end all sanctions, Western sanctions.
[03:02:36.633 --> 03:02:38.674]  But you know what's bizarre about that?
[03:02:39.754 --> 03:02:45.576]  Well, fast forward another year or 18 months, those Western sanctions aren't going to matter much anyway.
[03:02:46.137 --> 03:02:56.741]  Because Iran, and Russia, and China, and South Africa, and other countries have already rolled out the infrastructure, or they're in the process of rolling it out for the BRICS system.
[03:02:57.381 --> 03:03:04.023]  And the BRICS system, by the way, is an honest ledger system that no country can counterfeit.
[03:03:04.764 --> 03:03:05.744]  So think about this.
[03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:10.721]  You just saw a segment with Max Keiser right before this segment.
[03:03:11.001 --> 03:03:15.763]  Max Keiser was right on when he's talking about the fact that Bitcoin can't be counterfeited.
[03:03:16.543 --> 03:03:18.384]  Bitcoin is an honest ledger.
[03:03:19.024 --> 03:03:23.645]  And did you know that Russia just legalized Bitcoin for use in international trade settlements?
[03:03:24.725 --> 03:03:24.966]  Why?
[03:03:25.286 --> 03:03:30.707]  Because the West keeps weaponizing the Western dollar, the Western currencies, and the SWIFT system.
[03:03:31.388 --> 03:03:35.989]  Weaponizing it as punitive sanctions against countries that the West doesn't like.
[03:03:36.809 --> 03:03:40.972]  For example, Iran, or for Russia, or China, or what have you.
[03:03:41.633 --> 03:03:46.597]  So all those countries got together, mostly led by Russia, and said, we're going to have our own currency.
[03:03:46.997 --> 03:03:48.318]  It's going to be called the BRICS currency.
[03:03:48.839 --> 03:03:50.200]  We're going to switch over to that system.
[03:03:50.340 --> 03:03:52.402]  And that switchover begins this year.
[03:03:52.422 --> 03:03:56.465]  A lot of it will be implemented by late this year, with a lot more happening in 2025.
[03:03:56.505 --> 03:03:59.928]  They're going to have their own international settlements.
[03:04:00.766 --> 03:04:07.368]  Of buying and selling trading goods and government debt instruments and so on among each other without using dollars at all.
[03:04:08.148 --> 03:04:14.970]  And over 90% of the trade right now between Russia and China is carried out in non-dollar denominations.
[03:04:15.631 --> 03:04:17.891]  And that's a major shift just in the last couple of years.
[03:04:18.631 --> 03:04:23.933]  So the bottom line is that the dollar will ultimately collapse in value.
[03:04:24.773 --> 03:04:25.634]  We're over $35 trillion in debt.
[03:04:27.774 --> 03:04:34.297]  The money printing hasn't stopped and the dollar is a dishonest ledger because it can be counterfeited at any time.
[03:04:34.897 --> 03:04:40.080]  And it is being counterfeited and being printed and handed out all around the world and then weaponized against the enemies.
[03:04:41.540 --> 03:04:43.822]  Bitcoin can never function that way.
[03:04:44.062 --> 03:04:49.284]  No one can control Bitcoin because it's distributed by design, right?
[03:04:49.724 --> 03:04:52.145]  Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of nodes running around the world.
[03:04:52.205 --> 03:04:56.007]  Nobody can fudge the system or counterfeit currency into that system.
[03:04:56.528 --> 03:04:57.328]  Same thing with bricks.
[03:04:58.044 --> 03:05:05.888]  Now, interestingly, Bitcoin is a permissionless distributed ledger, whereas the BRICS system will be a permissioned distributed ledger.
[03:05:06.309 --> 03:05:11.312]  You'll only be allowed to run a node on BRICS if you're given that permission.
[03:05:11.332 --> 03:05:19.496]  It's just going to be the key countries who are involved running those nodes, which makes it more secure against hacker attacks, for example, or brute force work attacks.
[03:05:20.317 --> 03:05:23.158]  So the bottom line is BRICS is going to be backed by 40%.
[03:05:23.198 --> 03:05:24.419]  Gold is the current rumor.
[03:05:26.940 --> 03:05:38.885]  So you're going to have metals backing an international currency, the BRICS currency, that can't be counterfeited, can't be weaponized, which means that most of the world is going to flood into the BRICS system very quickly.
[03:05:38.905 --> 03:05:40.546]  They're going to abandon the dollar.
[03:05:40.566 --> 03:05:41.886]  The U.S.
[03:05:42.026 --> 03:05:50.050]  and Israel will be left just holding bags of dollars that are losing value and that they cannot weaponize any longer.
[03:05:51.098 --> 03:05:52.538]  Because who's going to want to take the dollars?
[03:05:53.098 --> 03:05:55.239]  Saudi Arabia doesn't want dollars anymore.
[03:05:55.259 --> 03:05:57.019]  Russia doesn't need dollars.
[03:05:57.099 --> 03:05:58.060]  Iran doesn't need dollars.
[03:05:58.100 --> 03:06:01.180]  Turkey has already said it doesn't have to use dollars.
[03:06:01.240 --> 03:06:02.601]  Turkey's going to join the BRIC system.
[03:06:03.521 --> 03:06:14.803]  So we're talking about the major manufacturers around the world, China, the major, number one manufacturer, plus all these other countries that are involved in energy production, Russia in particular and Iran and other countries.
[03:06:15.743 --> 03:06:17.964]  These countries are not going to use the U.S.
[03:06:18.004 --> 03:06:18.244]  dollar.
[03:06:19.088 --> 03:06:19.628]  So the U.S.
[03:06:19.669 --> 03:06:29.215]  dollar is going to be just this dinosaur of currency that's going to be printed to oblivion, and the U.S.
[03:06:29.235 --> 03:06:34.880]  won't be able to use it to fund any kind of actual production of weapons to win any wars in the Middle East.
[03:06:35.800 --> 03:06:40.784]  And the thing is, Iran knows this, and Russia knows this, and that's why they're delaying for time.
[03:06:41.670 --> 03:06:52.296]  All that Russia and China and Iran have to do, or the strategic opponents or enemies of the United States, all they have to do, and they know this, and Kim Dotcom tweeted about this the other day as well.
[03:06:52.356 --> 03:06:52.737]  He's right.
[03:06:53.277 --> 03:06:54.498]  All they have to do is sit back and wait.
[03:06:55.578 --> 03:06:56.019]  The U.S.
[03:06:56.059 --> 03:07:03.403]  is destroying itself, sadly, and it's going to be up to people like you and I to try to save this country and bring it back from the brink of destruction.
[03:07:04.517 --> 03:07:17.003]  And have an honest monetary system, which means the whole current system, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the dollar printing, that's got to be completely replaced with something closer to Bitcoin.
[03:07:17.443 --> 03:07:19.844]  Which is why Trump just talked about how the U.S.
[03:07:19.864 --> 03:07:21.765]  needs to be a leader in Bitcoin and the U.S.
[03:07:21.805 --> 03:07:28.468]  needs to have a massive national reserve of Bitcoin because it can't be cheated, it can't be counterfeited.
[03:07:28.509 --> 03:07:30.469]  Trump is very pioneering in this understanding.
[03:07:30.850 --> 03:07:31.470]  He's got it right.
[03:07:32.270 --> 03:07:32.670]  The U.S.
[03:07:32.690 --> 03:07:36.833]  needs a national currency that is honest, and then there'd be an economic boom.
[03:07:38.174 --> 03:07:55.644]  And if Kamala and Walls, if they get somehow elected or cheat their way into office, then you're going to see probably a breakup of the United States, and you're going to see new nations formed, such as the Republic of Texas probably, that will launch their own BRICS-like currencies, which will be
[03:07:56.664 --> 03:08:02.508]  Backed at least partially by precious metals, and it will be honest currency that can't be counterfeited by the state.
[03:08:03.309 --> 03:08:09.733]  And then the businesses will flock to those regions like they're fleeing California now and already moving to Texas and Florida and other states.
[03:08:09.753 --> 03:08:16.758]  And you're going to see a massive wave of economic abundance in those states, or new nations or new republics or whatever that looks like.
[03:08:17.439 --> 03:08:17.539]  Now,
[03:08:18.402 --> 03:08:34.009]  What I've got coming up for you here more today is an analysis of what Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, what's the real plan with Barack Obama behind the scenes, how they plan to carry out massive sabotage against the United States of America if Trump is elected in November.
[03:08:34.729 --> 03:08:39.431]  Of course, they plan to cheat, but they also know that their chances of winning are very slim at this point.
[03:08:39.911 --> 03:08:41.512]  And that's why they picked Walz, I believe.
[03:08:41.552 --> 03:08:43.393]  I'll give you that analysis in the next segment.
[03:08:44.096 --> 03:08:58.589]  But they plan to carry out sabotage operations against the United States and its economy and its currency, and to start World War III, and to cripple the domestic energy infrastructure to the maximum extent possible, and also to set off race wars.
[03:08:59.169 --> 03:09:06.936]  And what that's looking like now is that the radical left is going to pivot Antifa and other similar left-wing groups into the Free Palestine movement.
[03:09:07.811 --> 03:09:16.413]  Which even many Palestinians are not happy about that taking place because it's just going to radicalize that wing of the protests.
[03:09:17.494 --> 03:09:29.617]  So you're going to see the so-called free Palestine movements then waging lots of protests, kind of like what's happening in the UK right now between the conservatives and the Islamic people in the UK.
[03:09:29.837 --> 03:09:32.758]  You're going to see that on steroids in the United States if Trump wins.
[03:09:33.385 --> 03:09:39.367]  And between Election Day in November and then January 20th, you're gonna see massive riots.
[03:09:39.387 --> 03:09:43.389]  You're gonna see all kinds of kinetic damage, buildings being set on fire and so on.
[03:09:44.089 --> 03:09:55.394]  This is designed to hand Trump the weakest nation possible with the worst possible economy and the worst problems internationally dealing with wars.
[03:09:56.309 --> 03:10:01.413]  Russia, possibly Iran, China versus Taiwan situation, and so much more.
[03:10:01.833 --> 03:10:04.275]  And on top of that, having a domestic nightmare.
[03:10:04.695 --> 03:10:17.924]  So if you thought that the sabotage against Trump was bad during his first administration, hold on to your hats, folks, because it's gonna get ten times worse in Trump's next administration, which is technically his third administration.
[03:10:18.804 --> 03:10:25.389]  Don't you find it interesting that Trump will be the first president in US history to have won three elections but only served two terms?
[03:10:26.118 --> 03:10:27.001]  Hmm, interesting.
[03:10:27.603 --> 03:10:30.070]  But I guess that means we all get a chance to vote for him a third time.
[03:10:30.090 --> 03:10:31.895]  So that's good news.
[03:10:32.586 --> 03:10:33.947]  But we have to be ready.
[03:10:34.027 --> 03:10:34.867]  We have to be prepared.
[03:10:34.887 --> 03:10:37.048]  And that's part of what we're talking about here today.
[03:10:37.688 --> 03:10:41.150]  And if you could show me the clock, I'm not seeing it right now, that would be really helpful.
[03:10:41.190 --> 03:10:43.371]  But I know we're going to go to break shortly.
[03:10:43.951 --> 03:11:00.678]  And then when we come back in the next segment coming up, we're going to go over all the details of the exact sabotage plans, the invaders that have been sent into the United States, and also their plan, what they're going to attack, what their targets are, because they're being handed lists of targets, actually.
[03:11:01.238 --> 03:11:05.721]  And those are infrastructure targets that will be extremely vulnerable.
[03:11:06.182 --> 03:11:10.685]  Some of those will include power grid and energy infrastructure and many other things along those lines.
[03:11:11.325 --> 03:11:12.306]  Okay, I'm good.
[03:11:12.346 --> 03:11:13.306]  Sorry about that interruption there.
[03:11:14.587 --> 03:11:16.569]  So I'm just going to go into that right now because we've got time.
[03:11:17.529 --> 03:11:17.949]  So here we go.
[03:11:18.430 --> 03:11:25.915]  My military or former military intelligence contacts have told me about what has been smuggled into the United States.
[03:11:27.060 --> 03:11:36.614]  And I received another question today from another former veteran who pointed out that one of the weapon systems that's been smuggled is a ground-to-air missile system.
[03:11:37.254 --> 03:11:38.216]  The US State Department
[03:11:39.362 --> 03:11:41.984]  Put up all kinds of red flags about this over a year ago.
[03:11:42.544 --> 03:11:49.707]  They knew that across the open border, a surface-to-air missile system had been smuggled in successfully, and they were trying to locate it in the United States.
[03:11:50.148 --> 03:11:51.388]  I don't have a model number on that.
[03:11:51.448 --> 03:11:52.749]  I wasn't given that information.
[03:11:53.129 --> 03:11:58.452]  But apparently, it's a pretty hefty system that requires being towed or carried in a vehicle.
[03:11:58.472 --> 03:11:59.952]  It's not just some handheld thing.
[03:12:01.333 --> 03:12:03.014]  So fast forward to today.
[03:12:04.255 --> 03:12:07.297]  You've got the Trump administration coming up.
[03:12:07.818 --> 03:12:09.139]  They tried to kill Trump already.
[03:12:10.620 --> 03:12:14.422]  They shot him in the ear, missed their real target, his head.
[03:12:14.442 --> 03:12:16.064]  They tried to assassinate him.
[03:12:16.624 --> 03:12:20.747]  What's the next most logical expansion of their weapon systems against Trump?
[03:12:21.367 --> 03:12:25.791]  Well, Matt Bracken deserves a lot of credit on this because he's spoken about this quite a bit.
[03:12:26.611 --> 03:12:28.192]  They are area effect weapons.
[03:12:28.913 --> 03:12:30.474]  That includes surface-to-air missiles.
[03:12:31.235 --> 03:12:41.183]  So we need to get a message to Trump and his team urgently to have extra security at every location where his plane is taking off and landing.
[03:12:41.883 --> 03:12:53.592]  Because there are surface-to-air missiles in the hands of some kind of terrorist groups, possibly run by intelligence community members, possibly sock puppet kind of actors.
[03:12:54.393 --> 03:12:59.837]  And they could take out Trump's plane when it's taking off or landing at an airport.
[03:13:00.467 --> 03:13:06.412]  And I absolutely, obviously, I don't ever want to see any kind of violence like that happen against any candidate.
[03:13:06.892 --> 03:13:11.595]  Not any Democrat, not any Republican, not Trump, not Kamala, no one.
[03:13:12.196 --> 03:13:15.458]  That kind of violence is not acceptable, but it may be deployed.
[03:13:16.599 --> 03:13:21.143]  And we need to be realistic that they're going to move into area effect weapons to try to take out Trump.
[03:13:22.804 --> 03:13:27.868]  If Trump wins, the sabotage operations will include the activation of people
[03:13:28.562 --> 03:13:33.983]  Who are the military-age combat veterans who have been put into this country.
[03:13:34.203 --> 03:13:39.104]  They have invaded, they have occupied, and they will be given access to storage lockers.
[03:13:39.544 --> 03:13:51.187]  These will be containers and storage facilities across the country that are already pre-equipped with a tremendous amount of equipment, which includes, as Customs and Border Protection has already interdicted some of these,
[03:13:51.747 --> 03:13:58.790]  It includes full auto drop-in triggers or sears mechanisms for both AK and AR platforms.
[03:13:59.471 --> 03:14:01.672]  It includes night vision equipment.
[03:14:01.872 --> 03:14:06.774]  It includes illegal suppressors that have been shipped in from China and put into storage.
[03:14:08.011 --> 03:14:15.653]  It probably also includes some kinds of like homemade explosives of some kind, but we know for sure it includes mortars.
[03:14:16.314 --> 03:14:30.238]  So portable mortar systems, I don't know if they're 60 millimeter mortars or what they are, but they're portable mortar systems and they can be deployed against, you know, sadly, refineries and energy infrastructure because
[03:14:31.184 --> 03:14:34.425]  Their area effect weapons and refineries are very, very vulnerable.
[03:14:34.845 --> 03:14:44.587]  So I would urge like the governor of Texas, the people in Texas, the people in Louisiana, wherever you have energy infrastructure, please double down on your security.
[03:14:45.008 --> 03:14:52.590]  Please widen your security to the areas around your refineries because there are mortar systems.
[03:14:52.710 --> 03:14:56.591]  I don't know what the range is on them, but let's say thousands of meters.
[03:14:56.611 --> 03:14:57.491]  I don't know the exact right.
[03:14:57.511 --> 03:14:58.111]  I don't know the specs.
[03:14:59.071 --> 03:15:07.316]  But these could devastate our domestic energy supply, and that's going to be the effort that will be activated, that will be underway.
[03:15:07.957 --> 03:15:13.240]  In addition to that, and it pains me to bring you this information because I don't want to see America hurt.
[03:15:13.260 --> 03:15:14.901]  I don't want to see any bloodshed whatsoever.
[03:15:15.261 --> 03:15:16.282]  I want us to be vigilant.
[03:15:16.322 --> 03:15:18.663]  I want us to be safe and protected against this.
[03:15:20.164 --> 03:15:24.527]  But these enemy combatants, and Michael Yan has spoken about them at great length,
[03:15:25.288 --> 03:15:31.213]  They are given instructions, well they will be given instructions, excuse me, to attack law enforcement centers.
[03:15:31.233 --> 03:15:33.955]  They will attack police stations, they will attack sheriff's offices.
[03:15:34.635 --> 03:15:39.379]  So all of you listening who are in law enforcement, sheriff's deputies, police, SWAT team members,
[03:15:40.587 --> 03:15:44.230]  Double down on your security, internal security.
[03:15:44.370 --> 03:15:46.632]  Plan on your buildings being breached.
[03:15:46.993 --> 03:15:48.514]  How are you going to handle that threat?
[03:15:48.834 --> 03:15:53.178]  And this isn't just some idle lone shooter type of person who doesn't have experience with weapons.
[03:15:53.678 --> 03:15:56.381]  These are going to be teams that assault your positions.
[03:15:56.421 --> 03:15:58.342]  They're going to break in the back door, let's say.
[03:15:58.362 --> 03:16:01.845]  They're going to come in shooting, and their job is to try to wipe out all police.
[03:16:02.646 --> 03:16:05.949]  So I need you, please take this seriously.
[03:16:05.989 --> 03:16:06.970]  This intel comes from
[03:16:07.927 --> 03:16:11.709]  Many different sources spanning the last, well, 18 months in the aggregate.
[03:16:12.449 --> 03:16:19.753]  Targets will include bridges, not just refineries, but bridges and ports, and they will include power infrastructure.
[03:16:20.274 --> 03:16:22.475]  Even the FBI has warned about some of this as well.
[03:16:23.435 --> 03:16:26.217]  They've been sounding the alarm, and they're not wrong on that point.
[03:16:27.097 --> 03:16:30.099]  America's domestic infrastructure is absolutely being targeted.
[03:16:30.971 --> 03:16:42.598]  And if there's an activation day here, which could be a combination of things, it could be war with Iran sets this off, and then all of the Middle Eastern combat fighters in America go active.
[03:16:42.978 --> 03:16:51.583]  Or it could be that Trump wins the election, and then elements of the deep state, they go active with their actors and their saboteurs who are already here domestically.
[03:16:51.963 --> 03:16:54.145]  Or it could be both of those things happening at the same time.
[03:16:54.585 --> 03:16:58.247]  We don't know what's going to activate first, but we know we're vulnerable.
[03:16:58.917 --> 03:17:08.362]  And so, folks, get ready with your backup supplies, everything, energy, food, emergency medicine, all the things that you need in order to stay safe.
[03:17:08.823 --> 03:17:10.244]  Make sure you've got a bug-out plan.
[03:17:10.284 --> 03:17:12.845]  Make sure you've got a bug-out vehicle, a location.
[03:17:13.405 --> 03:17:14.366]  Make sure you are ready.
[03:17:15.166 --> 03:17:18.068]  Please support the rule of law in your community.
[03:17:18.108 --> 03:17:20.249]  Support local law enforcement if they need your help.
[03:17:22.029 --> 03:17:25.075]  Support civility and help those in need wherever you can.
[03:17:25.435 --> 03:17:29.402]  We'll be right back after this break with more straight ahead on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:17:34.801 --> 03:17:37.702]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[03:17:38.643 --> 03:17:43.625]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[03:17:44.125 --> 03:17:51.288]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[03:17:51.828 --> 03:17:53.809]  They let us private label their products.
[03:17:53.829 --> 03:17:54.710]  That's why you've already heard of
[03:17:55.590 --> 03:17:56.611]  Body's Old Turmeric Formula?
[03:17:56.951 --> 03:17:59.693]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[03:17:59.953 --> 03:18:01.254]  This is just their brand of that.
[03:18:01.594 --> 03:18:04.536]  And so, it is available under Turmeric 95.
[03:18:05.297 --> 03:18:05.897]  That's the name.
[03:18:06.157 --> 03:18:12.641]  So, we're sold out of Body's, but we have Turmeric 95 that is, again, the same concentrated turmeric.
[03:18:12.882 --> 03:18:13.922]  Same thing with Nitric Boost.
[03:18:14.362 --> 03:18:15.984]  Nitric Boost came from this company.
[03:18:16.024 --> 03:18:18.045]  They even let us use their name.
[03:18:18.325 --> 03:18:19.326]  It's now our best seller.
[03:18:19.526 --> 03:18:20.527]  We sold out of our version.
[03:18:20.807 --> 03:18:22.248]  Their version has a white model.
[03:18:22.568 --> 03:18:23.949]  It's the exact same thing.
[03:18:24.489 --> 03:18:26.090]  You get it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:18:26.310 --> 03:18:28.872]  So check out InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:18:29.753 --> 03:18:29.993]  All right.
[03:18:30.033 --> 03:18:30.833]  Welcome back, folks.
[03:18:30.913 --> 03:18:33.255]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:18:33.475 --> 03:18:34.876]  I'm Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.
[03:18:34.916 --> 03:18:37.918]  We've got a great guest lined up for you joining us just in a minute.
[03:18:38.218 --> 03:18:40.039]  It's Clay Clark from the Reawaken America Tours.
[03:18:40.419 --> 03:18:42.681]  I just want to mention something up front.
[03:18:43.747 --> 03:18:46.628]  Because there are a lot of amazing connections happening right now.
[03:18:47.248 --> 03:18:57.632]  And as you may recall, last week Alex had on the show Pastor Steve Ciccolanti and Brandon Biggs, who is a friend of Steve and also a pastor himself.
[03:18:57.692 --> 03:19:04.014]  And he had a prophetic vision months ago that Trump would be nearly shot, that a bullet would graze his right ear.
[03:19:04.034 --> 03:19:07.495]  And Pastor Biggs was right on track with that.
[03:19:08.216 --> 03:19:11.617]  And I want to thank Alex for having both of them on the show.
[03:19:12.282 --> 03:19:25.764]  Now, I've been a follower of Pastor Ciccolanti for many, many years, at least seven or eight years, and he has moved to Florida now, and he's setting up his new church, which is called Discover Church.
[03:19:26.551 --> 03:19:26.871]  I think so.
[03:19:46.182 --> 03:19:47.343]  I interviewed him yesterday.
[03:19:47.724 --> 03:19:54.009]  I'm actually publishing that interview tomorrow as well, which will be on Brighteon.com and also, you know, Rumble and other places.
[03:19:54.349 --> 03:19:55.770]  And there's one other thing I want to say here.
[03:19:55.810 --> 03:19:56.411]  Well, two things.
[03:19:57.952 --> 03:20:07.440]  Pastor Ciccolanti filmed that interview with Biggs with the prophecy in the living room of Clay Clark, who is our guest right now.
[03:20:07.480 --> 03:20:09.521]  We're gonna bring on Clay in just a second, but I want to show you something else.
[03:20:09.842 --> 03:20:11.103]  Oh, and here's Clay!
[03:20:12.104 --> 03:20:12.784]  Hi there, Clay!
[03:20:12.824 --> 03:20:13.545]  Welcome to the show!
[03:20:14.770 --> 03:20:35.726]  Hey, brother, I appreciate you, and I want people to know, I know Kim Clement had a prophetic word years ago involving me, and then we have this incredible prophecy from Brandon Biggs and Steve Cioccoloni in my kitchen, and I don't even know what to do with that, Mike, because I don't claim to be a prophet, nor the son of a prophet, but if you read the book of Amos, I feel like I have a lot in common with Amos.
[03:20:35.786 --> 03:20:38.048]  My job is just to share the truth.
[03:20:38.388 --> 03:20:59.843]  I know that's what you do, that's what Alex does, and whenever you have a prophecy that's broadcasted from your living room or from your kitchen or a prophecy from a Kim Clement about you, it's sort of an awe-inspiring, humbling, overwhelming thing, and so if you haven't watched that prophetic word from Brandon Biggs and Steve Cioccoloni, I encourage everybody to watch it.
[03:21:01.792 --> 03:21:02.433]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:21:02.533 --> 03:21:03.934]  I totally agree with that.
[03:21:04.094 --> 03:21:06.616]  And Clay, you're doing amazing work for America right now.
[03:21:06.656 --> 03:21:15.164]  And what you and I are observing, and Pastor Steve and others, is that God is working through us in very interesting and unexpected ways.
[03:21:15.224 --> 03:21:17.586]  And I want to share something with you here.
[03:21:17.646 --> 03:21:18.627]  This was given to me.
[03:21:18.667 --> 03:21:21.470]  This is the Holy Bible of my great-grandfather.
[03:21:21.490 --> 03:21:22.731]  It was given to him in 1959.
[03:21:22.771 --> 03:21:25.553]  And he was an ordained minister with the Assembly of God.
[03:21:28.820 --> 03:21:37.449]  And he traveled around the Midwest, Arkansas and Texas and Missouri and Oklahoma and other places and preached the Word of God back in those days.
[03:21:38.110 --> 03:21:41.554]  And I have been called to help share the Word.
[03:21:42.236 --> 03:21:48.739]  And to help share just a practical analysis of scripture, I've been putting out sermons myself lately.
[03:21:48.779 --> 03:21:52.221]  I'm doing 100 sermons in 100 days leading up to the election.
[03:21:52.561 --> 03:21:54.122]  I finished 10 somehow, Clay.
[03:21:54.222 --> 03:21:54.662]  I got through 10.
[03:21:55.002 --> 03:22:01.906]  I don't know how I'm going to do 90 more, but you know all about the scripture a lot more than I do.
[03:22:02.126 --> 03:22:03.666]  What do you think is happening right now?
[03:22:03.726 --> 03:22:06.808]  Why are people called to faith right now in this moment in American history?
[03:22:08.596 --> 03:22:21.202]  Okay, well, if you open your Bible to Revelation chapter 16, verse 12-14, Revelation chapter 16, verse 12-14, the Bible states, and I'm going to paraphrase this, but I encourage everyone to read it, and please assume I'm making this up, okay?
[03:22:21.542 --> 03:22:25.564]  The Bible states five things will happen, Revelation chapter 16, verse 12-14, seriously.
[03:22:25.884 --> 03:22:33.608]  The Bible states that when the Euphrates River dries up, and it is, the false prophet will show up, and Yuval Noah Harari is,
[03:22:34.441 --> 03:22:37.522]  And the beast technology will show up.
[03:22:37.842 --> 03:22:39.682]  Yuval, by the way, refers to AI as the beast.
[03:22:40.322 --> 03:22:44.463]  That the nations of the earth will gather against Israel and things will start to blow up.
[03:22:44.703 --> 03:22:44.863]  What?
[03:22:45.383 --> 03:22:47.864]  And China and Russia will team up.
[03:22:48.484 --> 03:22:54.665]  So everything that was prophesied in Revelation chapter 16 verse 12 through 14 is happening simultaneously.
[03:22:54.685 --> 03:22:58.486]  And if you say, you're taking that out of context, you can open your Bible to Mark chapter 13.
[03:22:59.796 --> 03:23:02.400]  Matthew Chapter 24 and Luke Chapter 21.
[03:23:02.580 --> 03:23:03.341]  A lot of Bible verses.
[03:23:03.401 --> 03:23:06.965]  Mark Chapter 13, Matthew Chapter 24, and Luke Chapter 21.
[03:23:07.206 --> 03:23:10.830]  And so I believe the Bible was written not to scare, but to prepare us.
[03:23:10.870 --> 03:23:13.674]  And I believe because you, Mike Adams, actually read the Bible,
[03:23:14.651 --> 03:23:17.292]  And because I actually read the Bible.
[03:23:17.352 --> 03:23:27.396]  I saw Alex Jones the other day do a wonderful broadcast where he was talking about how Satan in large part has dominion over large aspects of life on earth.
[03:23:27.556 --> 03:23:39.760]  You need to read the Bible because 27% of the Bible is prophetic, 73% of the Bible is historical, and I believe that people that do read the Bible are going to be the ones who actually know what's going on.
[03:23:40.180 --> 03:23:42.201]  The people who have discernment to understand what's happening.
[03:23:43.931 --> 03:24:02.585]  Well, thank you, Clay, and I would add to that that, you know, I had never read the entire Bible until recently, now going through it, you know, verse by verse, and just absolutely fascinated by, you know, like the philosophy of Paul and the questions of Job.
[03:24:02.925 --> 03:24:05.547]  And also, I was doing a sermon on Matthew 24.
[03:24:05.967 --> 03:24:09.570]  That's my sermon for today, by the way, just a little piece of it because it's a lot to handle.
[03:24:11.974 --> 03:24:21.740]  I just want to encourage everybody out there, if you've never read the Bible, if you've never gone to church, if you've never even considered yourself, you know, Christian or spiritual or religious, guess what?
[03:24:22.061 --> 03:24:23.301]  You can look at it with fresh eyes.
[03:24:23.341 --> 03:24:24.162]  And you know what, Clay?
[03:24:24.522 --> 03:24:28.725]  What really resonates with me about the Bible and about Paul the Apostle, for example,
[03:24:29.454 --> 03:24:30.374]  The persecution.
[03:24:30.735 --> 03:24:33.796]  And that's something that we can all resonate with right now.
[03:24:34.316 --> 03:24:38.918]  I don't think you can even understand the Bible unless you've gone through some form of persecution yourself.
[03:24:39.319 --> 03:24:46.602]  As we have, all of us who have been Trump supporters or conservatives or those who speak with righteousness, Clay, we have been persecuted.
[03:24:46.662 --> 03:24:53.405]  And so many of the people that you connect with, that you have on stage speaking at your Reawaken America tours, they're all persecuted too.
[03:24:53.785 --> 03:24:57.627]  Isn't that a core theme of our time right now that's actually bringing us in a way closer to God?
[03:24:59.983 --> 03:25:06.148]  Yes, Matthew 5.10 from the Bible says, Blessed are ye who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for they shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.
[03:25:06.168 --> 03:25:12.835]  Again, Matthew 5.10 from the Bible says, Blessed are ye who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.
[03:25:12.875 --> 03:25:22.064]  Now, again, I say that because we were backstage at one of the events, and I encourage anybody, Mike, who hasn't been to a Reawaken America Tour, you know, the final stop for us will be October 18th and 19th.
[03:25:22.124 --> 03:25:23.025]  It's going to be in Salem.
[03:25:23.625 --> 03:25:24.346]  North Carolina.
[03:25:24.366 --> 03:25:28.509]  And folks, you can get tickets or learn more about it by going to Timetofreeamerica.com.
[03:25:28.929 --> 03:25:30.570]  Timetofreeamerica.com.
[03:25:30.610 --> 03:25:35.794]  And again, the mainstream media likes to say you can't name your price, but you can name your price at Timetofreeamerica.com.
[03:25:36.014 --> 03:25:38.376]  And if you use promo code Mike Adams, we no longer charge you more.
[03:25:38.917 --> 03:25:40.077]  That's Timetofreeamerica.com.
[03:25:40.097 --> 03:25:41.939]  But anyway, we're backstage at the Reawakened Tour.
[03:25:42.419 --> 03:25:49.741]  And I'm there talking to Eric Trump, I'm talking to General Flynn, Mike Lindell, really people that are much more well known than I am.
[03:25:50.221 --> 03:25:54.922]  And one of these amazing speakers looks and they look off to their left and they said, who's that guy?
[03:25:55.322 --> 03:25:56.542]  And I said, I don't know who that guy is.
[03:25:56.562 --> 03:26:02.663]  Well, I find out that the guy backstage was the son, he was a son of one of the speakers, probably 16 years old.
[03:26:03.163 --> 03:26:07.864]  And one of the speakers, I won't mention his name, but he said to me, I don't feel comfortable about this kid.
[03:26:07.884 --> 03:26:08.565]  And I said, why not?
[03:26:08.605 --> 03:26:10.145]  He said, well, he's not being sued.
[03:26:10.876 --> 03:26:12.116]  He's not being subpoenaed.
[03:26:12.496 --> 03:26:13.817]  He's not being prosecuted.
[03:26:13.837 --> 03:26:17.098]  I mean, don't you have to show your papers to get backstage?
[03:26:17.458 --> 03:26:20.518]  And it was kind of a joke, because we're in this high-security situation, right?
[03:26:20.799 --> 03:26:22.299]  There's a lot of security threats.
[03:26:22.859 --> 03:26:27.620]  And it was kind of that gallows humor, but the joke that resonated with everybody was, it's true.
[03:26:27.820 --> 03:26:36.883]  You almost have to be, at this point, sued, subpoenaed, persecuted or prosecuted, deplatformed to be backstage at the Reawaken America Tour.
[03:26:36.903 --> 03:26:38.383]  And if you look at the lineup of speakers,
[03:26:38.883 --> 03:26:41.126]  Peter Navarro just got out of jail.
[03:26:41.566 --> 03:26:45.711]  He's one of the key speakers in Selma, North Carolina, October 18th and 19th.
[03:26:45.771 --> 03:26:47.432]  General Flynn lost his family.
[03:26:48.073 --> 03:26:55.241]  He was an honored military man who had served in our military, a veteran who had served honorably for 33 years in the military.
[03:26:56.041 --> 03:26:56.421]  I don't
[03:27:12.210 --> 03:27:12.570]  I don't know.
[03:27:35.035 --> 03:27:39.377]  Prosecution persecution is how I would describe it, or in my case to a certain extent.
[03:27:39.877 --> 03:27:47.741]  I've been in a lawsuit for three and a half years related to comments that people have said on the stage at the Reawaken America tour that happened to be true.
[03:27:50.582 --> 03:28:01.908]  Oh wow, so for the record I think the judgment that was handed down by the, I would call it a rigged court trial system against Alex Jones, something approaching 1.5 billion dollars,
[03:28:03.451 --> 03:28:06.833]  And also, General Flynn, as you just mentioned, let me plug his movie.
[03:28:06.853 --> 03:28:08.614]  It's called FlynnMovie.com.
[03:28:08.914 --> 03:28:10.795]  If you haven't yet seen the movie, folks, go there.
[03:28:10.895 --> 03:28:11.896]  FlynnMovie.com.
[03:28:12.256 --> 03:28:12.997]  Watch the trailer.
[03:28:13.317 --> 03:28:17.579]  I just interviewed Scott Wiper yesterday, also, who's the producer of that film.
[03:28:17.619 --> 03:28:18.680]  We had an amazing conversation.
[03:28:19.160 --> 03:28:20.081]  General Flynn has
[03:28:21.119 --> 03:28:25.741]  He has been tortured by this deep state, and he stood his ground the entire time.
[03:28:26.241 --> 03:28:27.862]  He has done the Christian thing.
[03:28:28.342 --> 03:28:38.205]  You know, he held his ground on principle, even when everything was threatened against him, and they took everything from him that is material, you know, money, assets, home, all of that.
[03:28:38.806 --> 03:28:40.606]  So, General Flynn is an American hero.
[03:28:40.766 --> 03:28:41.887]  Clay, question to you.
[03:28:42.707 --> 03:28:47.829]  Do you think that General Flynn will serve again if he is called to by President Trump again?
[03:28:49.580 --> 03:28:50.301]  Well, I'll say this.
[03:28:50.361 --> 03:29:01.050]  I consider myself a little bit of an insider because I do speak to Eric Trump and General Flynn and Kash Patel and Alina Haba and all these people on a daily basis in many instances.
[03:29:01.070 --> 03:29:06.015]  So I don't want to share anything that's confidential, but I would say that General Flynn loves President Trump.
[03:29:06.582 --> 03:29:10.987]  I mean, he loves him in a way like you love your brother, you love your sister.
[03:29:11.047 --> 03:29:20.597]  I mean, he has an unbelievable loyalty to President Donald J. Trump, and he believes that President Trump is really the only option that we have to save our country.
[03:29:20.617 --> 03:29:22.178]  I don't mean that as a backhanded compliment, Mike.
[03:29:22.198 --> 03:29:23.500]  You and I have talked about this offline.
[03:29:23.940 --> 03:29:32.310]  But I mean, President Trump is really the only thing standing in the way between the Great Reset or this digital dystopian dictatorship, right?
[03:29:32.350 --> 03:29:41.461]  This social credit score, this green New Deal, this carbon credit score, this 15-minute city, this fourth Industrial Revolution.
[03:29:41.801 --> 03:29:48.810]  The only thing standing in the way between that occurring and the American freedoms that we grew up with is President Donald J. Trump.
[03:29:48.870 --> 03:29:51.894]  And so General Flynn has recognized that for a long time.
[03:29:51.934 --> 03:29:56.860]  He campaigned for free for President Trump, as you'll see in General Flynn's documentary in 2015-2016.
[03:29:58.562 --> 03:30:11.929]  And General Flynn really respects President Donald J. Trump a lot, and I know that he would be happy to, eager to, excited to serve in any capacity that Donald J. Trump would ask General Flynn to help save this country.
[03:30:12.949 --> 03:30:25.015]  Again, there's just an unbelievable loyalty that General Flynn has, and I underscore that because the media always tries to create division and try to imply that there's some sort of rift, but nothing could be further from the truth.
[03:30:25.075 --> 03:30:27.056]  General Flynn loves Donald J. Trump.
[03:30:28.317 --> 03:30:31.783]  Yeah, absolutely, as do, I think, most real Americans.
[03:30:32.464 --> 03:30:39.897]  And I want to say, too, for the record, the last time that I interviewed you, several months ago, well before the assassination attempt of Trump,
[03:30:41.695 --> 03:30:51.463]  I was really frustrated that day, and I was expressing some concern about a couple of issues that I had problems with Trump, Operation Warp Speed and all that.
[03:30:51.503 --> 03:31:00.710]  And I got to say, you know what, after the assassination attempt, and after seeing the wretched evil that the left and the deep state have put on display for us, I got to say,
[03:31:01.468 --> 03:31:05.671]  All the criticisms, even in my own mind, that I had of Trump, they've melted away.
[03:31:05.711 --> 03:31:07.112]  They're irrelevant at this point.
[03:31:07.613 --> 03:31:09.854]  If we want to have a nation, it's Trump.
[03:31:10.275 --> 03:31:15.879]  I mean, Trump is the one that we've got to get into office to literally drain the swamp this time.
[03:31:15.899 --> 03:31:19.502]  I mean, well, I suppose metaphorically, but I mean, get it done this time.
[03:31:20.062 --> 03:31:27.308]  So, Clay, I mean, everything that I was asking about Trump or concerned about Trump, it doesn't even seem to matter at this point.
[03:31:27.348 --> 03:31:27.528]  Sure.
[03:31:29.065 --> 03:31:29.886]  Well, I'll say this.
[03:31:29.986 --> 03:31:35.629]  I mean, Mike, this is before I met you, but my wife knew who you were because my wife listens to your show a lot more than me, Mike.
[03:31:35.669 --> 03:31:40.592]  This is when I was doing my Thrive Time Show podcast where I only talked about business and how to grow businesses.
[03:31:40.612 --> 03:31:41.912]  I never talked about these kind of topics.
[03:31:42.473 --> 03:31:45.555]  I told my family and friends, I said, President Donald J. Trump is a great fit.
[03:31:45.615 --> 03:31:47.536]  I initially wanted Ben Carson to win, right?
[03:31:47.956 --> 03:31:49.537]  And so I wasn't talking about it on my show.
[03:31:49.557 --> 03:31:50.798]  I was just talking to family and friends.
[03:31:50.838 --> 03:31:51.338]  And I said, you know,
[03:31:51.838 --> 03:31:56.162]  Trump beat Ben Carson and Trump is the only viable option we have to save this country.
[03:31:56.582 --> 03:32:00.245]  I said it then, I meant it then, and then people ask me, well, what do you think about Pence?
[03:32:00.305 --> 03:32:01.866]  I said, I don't think Pence is a good guy.
[03:32:02.066 --> 03:32:03.647]  I don't think Pence is America first.
[03:32:03.667 --> 03:32:04.588]  That's my take on it.
[03:32:05.068 --> 03:32:15.697]  And I believe they're going to try to infiltrate or to, uh, I would say maybe the word is retard or to slow down or to obstruct the America first agenda of Trump by surrounding him by idiots.
[03:32:16.137 --> 03:32:20.260]  And I believe, I do believe this today, we will see a similar attempt again.
[03:32:20.280 --> 03:32:21.201]  I think you're going to try to see
[03:32:22.161 --> 03:32:30.423]  Trump, you're going to try to see those that do not like America first, that do not like Trump, to try to surround him with nefarious people that do not want what is best for our country.
[03:32:30.443 --> 03:32:40.326]  And so my prayer is that President Donald J. Trump will have that discernment and I would just like to humbly submit the following five people that I think should be serving in Trump's administration on providing solutions.
[03:32:41.146 --> 03:32:45.247]  One, I really do believe that Ben Carson should help dismantle the medical-industrial complex.
[03:32:45.267 --> 03:32:46.708]  That's Ben Carson.
[03:32:46.788 --> 03:32:56.050]  Second, wouldn't you love to see Laura Trump being our press secretary, or Tucker Carlson being our press secretary, or Alina Haba being our press secretary?
[03:32:56.070 --> 03:32:59.131]  I mean, how about a Tucker Carlson press secretary?
[03:32:59.151 --> 03:33:00.012]  What would that look like?
[03:33:00.072 --> 03:33:01.252]  I mean, wow, that would be a lot of fun.
[03:33:01.592 --> 03:33:04.913]  So I'd love to see Tucker Carlson, Laura Trump, Alina Haba in there in some capacity.
[03:33:05.593 --> 03:33:09.336]  I'd really, really like to see Douglas McGregor retired.
[03:33:09.496 --> 03:33:12.098]  You know, this is again Douglas McGregor, retired military.
[03:33:12.438 --> 03:33:14.379]  I'd love to see him serving in that administration.
[03:33:14.399 --> 03:33:14.820]  Would love to see it.
[03:33:14.840 --> 03:33:20.243]  I'd love to see General Flynn serving there in that, serving under President Donald J. Trump.
[03:33:20.504 --> 03:33:22.265]  And I'd also love to see Kash Patel.
[03:33:22.305 --> 03:33:23.225]  Love to see Kash Patel.
[03:33:23.506 --> 03:33:26.147]  And I'd love to see Eric Trump serve as some sort of Chief of Staff.
[03:33:26.748 --> 03:33:28.149]  Eric Trump has great discernment.
[03:33:28.169 --> 03:33:28.369]  Absolutely.
[03:33:28.389 --> 03:33:31.031]  And that's just a handful of people that I'd like to see around Trump.
[03:33:31.911 --> 03:33:36.655]  I can't speak to who all the bad actors are and that sort of thing, but I want to see people that know Trump, that love Trump.
[03:33:36.675 --> 03:33:40.498]  I'd love to see Eric Trump working as a chief of staff because it's such an important role.
[03:33:40.898 --> 03:33:45.882]  And Eric Trump does a great job leading the Trump Organization, which by the way has thousands of employees.
[03:33:46.402 --> 03:33:49.845]  And the reason why the systems work is because nothing works unless your people work.
[03:33:50.225 --> 03:33:52.467]  And so Eric Trump brings in those A players.
[03:33:52.827 --> 03:33:55.008]  He's a great staffer, a great recruiter, a great leader.
[03:33:55.289 --> 03:33:57.230]  I'd love to see Eric Trump be that chief of staff.
[03:33:57.290 --> 03:33:59.632]  Again, love to see Tucker Carlson be that press secretary.
[03:34:00.112 --> 03:34:03.533]  Love to see Ben Carson dismantle that medical-industrial complex.
[03:34:03.613 --> 03:34:08.394]  Love to see General Flynn wage war against the military-industrial complex.
[03:34:08.454 --> 03:34:09.974]  It's just a handful of people I'd love to see.
[03:34:09.994 --> 03:34:11.414]  I'd love to see Kash Patel get in there.
[03:34:12.115 --> 03:34:18.236]  Again, I don't know everybody, but I know who some of the bad actors are, but those are just some of the names I would submit as the good guys.
[03:34:19.096 --> 03:34:20.156]  Well, I think that's really critical.
[03:34:20.456 --> 03:34:22.757]  That's an excellent list, and you're exactly right.
[03:34:22.877 --> 03:34:23.597]  This time around,
[03:34:24.435 --> 03:34:38.165]  Trump has got to exercise discernment, not let the pences in, not let the backstabbers anywhere near him and make sure that Chief Counsel and other key members in the White House are not working against him or working for the globalist agenda.
[03:34:38.585 --> 03:34:40.386]  Now, let's shift gears.
[03:34:40.566 --> 03:34:44.429]  What happens if the Democrats manage to rig this thing?
[03:34:44.449 --> 03:34:50.113]  I don't think they can win it organically, but they can rig it and they're working hard to rig it.
[03:34:50.653 --> 03:34:52.535]  What does our country look like if we get a
[03:34:53.316 --> 03:34:59.707]  Kamala Harris, Tim Walz administration, you know, straight up Marxist-Communist.
[03:34:59.727 --> 03:35:00.469]  What does that look like?
[03:35:02.190 --> 03:35:05.331]  Well, I just talked today to one of the wealthiest men in Minnesota.
[03:35:05.571 --> 03:35:10.153]  So I had a conversation today with one of the wealthiest men in Minnesota, and I grew up in Minnesota.
[03:35:10.173 --> 03:35:20.096]  So, Mike, occasionally, if we're having a really good conversation, if it's late at night, I might say, oh, don't you know, oh, for a cute Mike, don't you know, you know, I might go into hardcore Minnesota.
[03:35:20.116 --> 03:35:27.278]  And if I'm if I spend any time at all, seriously, with people from Minnesota, I'll start to say, oh, for a cute or don't you know.
[03:35:27.498 --> 03:35:28.739]  I mean, it's just a bizarre thing.
[03:35:28.779 --> 03:35:30.239]  My wife is like, what has got into you?
[03:35:30.299 --> 03:35:31.880]  Why do you keep saying Oofta?
[03:35:32.000 --> 03:35:34.961]  And it's just because you slip back into that Minnesotan very quickly.
[03:35:35.501 --> 03:35:40.463]  So I left Minnesota, not because I don't like the state, but the state tends to be blue.
[03:35:41.644 --> 03:35:43.105]  Tends to be a blue state.
[03:35:43.145 --> 03:35:46.486]  The farm community is heavily subsidized.
[03:35:46.506 --> 03:35:52.309]  There tends to be kind of a downtown, non-American demographic down there.
[03:35:53.169 --> 03:35:56.111]  I'm not a big fan of a lot of the politics in Minnesota.
[03:35:56.571 --> 03:35:58.552]  And a friend of mine is very wealthy.
[03:35:58.612 --> 03:35:59.312]  He lives in Minnesota.
[03:35:59.332 --> 03:36:01.293]  One of the most successful entrepreneurs in Minnesota.
[03:36:01.333 --> 03:36:01.833]  No hyperbole.
[03:36:01.853 --> 03:36:03.654]  I mean, this guy's killing the game.
[03:36:04.326 --> 03:36:07.668]  And he says to me, this guy is the worst governor.
[03:36:07.688 --> 03:36:19.235]  This guy actually contemplated moving from Minnesota for the sole reason that the governor of Minnesota made it so hard for him to run his businesses with his thousands of locations.
[03:36:19.416 --> 03:36:22.177]  He thought about moving his business from Minnesota.
[03:36:22.197 --> 03:36:25.860]  This is a nationwide company with thousands of locations.
[03:36:25.920 --> 03:36:32.704]  And he contemplated just getting out of Minnesota entirely because there's so much red tape and so much outright communism.
[03:36:34.423 --> 03:36:35.603]  Well, I understand that.
[03:36:35.643 --> 03:36:41.584]  I mean, I run a business in Texas, and I'm so grateful for the legislature in Texas.
[03:36:41.664 --> 03:36:44.925]  I mean, we've got a governor who's pro-business and pro-energy.
[03:36:45.805 --> 03:36:53.046]  We are really blessed in Texas, but if I were in a state like Minnesota, I'd probably leave, too, just as a business owner.
[03:36:53.586 --> 03:36:56.487]  I mean, how's Oklahoma for business?
[03:36:56.527 --> 03:36:58.027]  Probably pretty good, I would imagine, huh?
[03:36:59.928 --> 03:37:01.568]  Well, you know, our governor
[03:37:02.930 --> 03:37:10.437]  Governor Stitt, he classifies himself as one of the freest governors in America.
[03:37:10.457 --> 03:37:11.998]  I'm not really sure what that means, Mike.
[03:37:12.018 --> 03:37:16.602]  I'm a big fan of this thing called the Constitution, this First Amendment right to peaceably gather.
[03:37:17.103 --> 03:37:18.204]  I don't know what it means to be
[03:37:19.802 --> 03:37:23.064]  More free, but in my opinion, we should just be the home of the free, land of the brave, right?
[03:37:23.825 --> 03:37:29.590]  But in Oklahoma, we did have lockdowns, we did have quarantines, they did put a lot of energy into pushing the shots.
[03:37:30.792 --> 03:37:36.116]  But in contrast to the friends and family that I know that live in Minnesota, Minnesota was radical.
[03:37:36.297 --> 03:37:38.639]  The lockdowns, the quarantines, the curfews.
[03:37:39.199 --> 03:37:42.221]  The mask mandates, this is the jackassery, the wokeness.
[03:37:42.241 --> 03:37:48.005]  Did you know that the governor of Minnesota, this is true folks, and I apologize, this is true, and if you want to put earmuffs, you can.
[03:37:48.345 --> 03:37:58.512]  The governor of Minnesota, this is fact, he has demanded that tampons must be available in the boys' restroom in high schools.
[03:38:01.173 --> 03:38:02.094]  Think about that for a second.
[03:38:02.374 --> 03:38:05.076]  That's the tampon gym meme there, yeah.
[03:38:06.448 --> 03:38:07.809]  I mean, what does that mean?
[03:38:07.869 --> 03:38:10.291]  Is he expecting a flood of women to go into the men's restroom?
[03:38:10.311 --> 03:38:10.992]  Or what was he thinking?
[03:38:12.253 --> 03:38:14.174]  Well, I don't know, but I'm interested.
[03:38:14.194 --> 03:38:16.176]  Did they come with instructions or something?
[03:38:16.236 --> 03:38:18.257]  Because wouldn't it be confusing to all the young men?
[03:38:18.297 --> 03:38:20.919]  Like, what exactly are we doing with these things, you know?
[03:38:21.860 --> 03:38:26.343]  Maybe Walls can demonstrate that as part of the campaign message.
[03:38:26.404 --> 03:38:29.026]  Maybe he can show the young men how to use the tampons.
[03:38:29.306 --> 03:38:29.706]  Who knows?
[03:38:30.467 --> 03:38:32.308]  That might be very popular on the left.
[03:38:34.009 --> 03:38:34.650]  Mike, I'll say it.
[03:38:35.776 --> 03:38:36.396]  A true story.
[03:38:36.436 --> 03:38:37.737]  This is kind of a sad story, but it's true.
[03:38:38.477 --> 03:38:43.878]  A young man who, I'll be very vague, but in the state of Oklahoma, his father is my friend.
[03:38:43.898 --> 03:38:45.318]  So there's a guy I know very well.
[03:38:45.338 --> 03:38:46.038]  I know the father.
[03:38:46.058 --> 03:38:46.638]  I don't know the son.
[03:38:47.359 --> 03:38:58.461]  But the young man, the son, discovered that at certain schools, you're allowed to now go into the women's restroom or the women's locker room if you identify as a woman.
[03:38:59.330 --> 03:39:00.531]  You know, Mike, think about this.
[03:39:00.991 --> 03:39:03.052]  You're a 16-year-old horndog, okay?
[03:39:03.232 --> 03:39:09.376]  You're the popular kid in school, you know, and you figured out, hey, I can go into the girls' locker room whenever I want.
[03:39:09.396 --> 03:39:12.317]  I mean, this guy is like the Stifler, you know, from American Pie?
[03:39:12.617 --> 03:39:16.319]  This young man, my friend's son is like Stifler of his school.
[03:39:16.380 --> 03:39:20.142]  He's just a testosterone freak, you know what I mean?
[03:39:20.162 --> 03:39:23.744]  This kid needs to be, like, put on a shot collar or something, you know what I mean?
[03:39:23.764 --> 03:39:24.864]  His parents need to beat him.
[03:39:25.244 --> 03:39:27.926]  So he figures out that he can work his way into
[03:39:28.849 --> 03:39:30.491]  The girl's locker room whenever he wants.
[03:39:31.232 --> 03:39:40.302]  And so the dad tells me, he says, can you believe that my son is able to get into the girl's locker room whenever he wants because he simply states that he identifies as a woman?
[03:39:42.017 --> 03:39:43.358]  Unfortunately, I can.
[03:39:43.598 --> 03:39:53.023]  To move on, this guy, this is a friend of mine who's not political at all, he said in Oklahoma schools there is now kitty litter in the bathrooms of many of the schools.
[03:39:53.323 --> 03:39:54.784]  Kitty litter.
[03:39:55.084 --> 03:39:55.524]  Kitty litter.
[03:39:55.584 --> 03:39:56.324]  I'm not making this up.
[03:39:56.505 --> 03:39:56.745]  What?
[03:39:56.885 --> 03:39:59.106]  I mean, this is for kids to identify as an animal.
[03:39:59.586 --> 03:40:06.590]  So I would just say this, if you're out there today, I mean this sincerely, if you're out there today and you're listening and you say, well what can I do to save this country?
[03:40:07.011 --> 03:40:09.712]  I've got three calls to action for you, real quick, 90 miles an hour.
[03:40:10.153 --> 03:40:15.436]  One is if you haven't watched FlynnMovie.com, as you mentioned earlier, the Flynn documentary really is a powerful
[03:40:16.736 --> 03:40:27.181]  Second, if you haven't got your tickets for the Reawaken America Tour, we are having Peter Navarro, Laura Trump, Eric Trump, Kash Patel, General Flynn, Team America.
[03:40:27.201 --> 03:40:28.761]  I mean, we've had Alex Jones at these events.
[03:40:28.781 --> 03:40:32.823]  We've had Owen Schroer, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, Dr. Richard Bartlett.
[03:40:32.843 --> 03:40:34.683]  If you get injured, you'll be just fine.
[03:40:34.704 --> 03:40:35.744]  We have a lot of doctors on site.
[03:40:36.124 --> 03:40:38.045]  Dr. Jane Ruby, it's going to be a blasty blast.
[03:40:38.125 --> 03:40:40.766]  That's going to be North Carolina, October 18th and 19th.
[03:40:41.006 --> 03:40:44.147]  That website is timetofreeamerica.com, timetofreeamerica.com.
[03:40:44.187 --> 03:40:58.092]  And then call to action number three, if you're taking notes today while navigating on a skateboard over a gravel road, trying to take notes with some pocket lint and a pen that doesn't work, that website again is timetofreeamerica.com, timetofreeamerica.com.
[03:40:59.073 --> 03:40:59.753]  All right, hold on, Clay.
[03:41:00.093 --> 03:41:02.654]  Now, but you, I got to hold you on this.
[03:41:02.774 --> 03:41:04.475]  You have told me previously
[03:41:05.293 --> 03:41:08.297]  That it was the last event like a year ago.
[03:41:08.317 --> 03:41:08.757]  I know.
[03:41:08.978 --> 03:41:12.322]  And then there's another event added and another event added.
[03:41:13.483 --> 03:41:14.224]  You are sick!
[03:41:14.244 --> 03:41:15.666]  I've been noticing this place.
[03:41:15.886 --> 03:41:16.727]  So what's the story?
[03:41:18.750 --> 03:41:31.566]  I have committed to Eric Trump, committed to General Flynn, that I am going to do everything I can possibly do to help save this country and to put President Donald J. Trump back in office between now and November.
[03:41:31.587 --> 03:41:32.688]  That's the commitment I've made.
[03:41:32.708 --> 03:41:34.390]  You and I have talked about this a little bit offline.
[03:41:34.690 --> 03:41:37.214]  That's the mindset I have is we've got to get Trump in office, right?
[03:41:37.774 --> 03:41:49.672]  So when you've got the soon-to-be Commander-in-Chief, President Donald J. Trump's son asking you to do one more, and General Flynn asking you to... Because our events are kind of like the reverse of the RNC.
[03:41:49.752 --> 03:41:51.194]  I mean, there's no censorship at all.
[03:41:51.946 --> 03:41:55.587]  There's no sponsorship, which by the way, Mike, that's the key to me losing copious amounts of money.
[03:41:55.607 --> 03:41:57.487]  I found a way to not have corporate sponsorships.
[03:41:57.787 --> 03:41:59.508]  So there's no censorship.
[03:41:59.828 --> 03:42:00.948]  Yes, you've been to our events.
[03:42:00.988 --> 03:42:02.688]  I mean, I never tell you what to say.
[03:42:02.968 --> 03:42:04.069]  There's no teleprompter.
[03:42:04.329 --> 03:42:07.069]  When you spoke at our events, I had no idea what you were going to say.
[03:42:07.609 --> 03:42:14.711]  And so what's happened is the world, there's really no other event in the world, is my understanding, in the world where there is no censorship.
[03:42:15.251 --> 03:42:18.213]  And no corporate sponsorship to try to steer the conversation.
[03:42:18.274 --> 03:42:21.036]  And so I've been asked to host one more, so I said, okay.
[03:42:21.376 --> 03:42:22.717]  So here we go, final one, October.
[03:42:22.877 --> 03:42:30.423]  All right, Clay, we're run up out of time here right now, but timetofreeamerica.com is your event website.
[03:42:30.843 --> 03:42:31.984]  Folks, go there and check it out.
[03:42:32.544 --> 03:42:39.109]  And also, by the way, support this channel, support the sponsors, drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:42:39.350 --> 03:42:40.130]  Thanks for watching today.
[03:42:40.170 --> 03:42:41.852]  I'm Mike Adams, The Health Ranger.
[03:42:41.892 --> 03:42:42.212]  Take care.
[03:42:52.935 --> 03:43:08.359]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high-quality supplements, because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up, and it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[03:43:09.199 --> 03:43:14.620]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[03:43:15.689 --> 03:43:24.252]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[03:43:24.592 --> 03:43:26.452]  We had five companies making product for us.
[03:43:27.073 --> 03:43:31.574]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're InfoWars.
[03:43:32.294 --> 03:43:37.976]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[03:43:38.356 --> 03:43:40.857]  Not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[03:43:41.677 --> 03:43:43.198]  And they said, listen, you know
[03:43:44.420 --> 03:44:00.412]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[03:44:00.793 --> 03:44:07.478]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[03:44:08.533 --> 03:44:09.675]  We're good to go.
[03:44:20.453 --> 03:44:28.557]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we're even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[03:44:28.637 --> 03:44:35.260]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[03:44:35.420 --> 03:44:37.921]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[03:44:38.081 --> 03:44:40.002]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[03:44:40.202 --> 03:44:49.968]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[03:44:50.609 --> 03:44:53.010]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[03:44:53.070 --> 03:44:54.111]  Take Turmeric 95.
[03:44:55.792 --> 03:45:02.514]  Turmeric 95 isn't called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[03:45:02.614 --> 03:45:08.276]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[03:45:08.376 --> 03:45:16.898]  So, Boddy's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[03:45:16.958 --> 03:45:19.019]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[03:45:20.649 --> 03:45:33.954]  Because of the bankruptcy, attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[03:45:34.434 --> 03:45:38.835]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[03:45:38.895 --> 03:45:43.537]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[03:45:47.440 --> 03:45:49.781]  So I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[03:45:49.881 --> 03:45:50.482]  It's amazing.
[03:45:50.622 --> 03:45:51.542]  It's super high quality.
[03:45:51.622 --> 03:45:53.464]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[03:46:13.777 --> 03:46:14.257]  Thank you.
