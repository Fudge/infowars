[00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.969]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.669]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and support the Infowars.
[00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.589]  It's Thursday, October 17th, 2024.
[00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.230]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.530]  The preparations for martial law are now being openly announced.
[00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.460]  We are 18 days, 14 hours, 59 minutes, 36 seconds, the most important election in world history.
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.439]  It is October 17th, 2024.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:59.679]  It's 26 days until Infowars is auctioned off, and the feds have filed in federal court a motion to the judge to say they own the name Alex Jones, and that they own real Alex Jones, which all the courts have the passive rule they can't do.
[00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.519]  We're obviously going to file motions and block that, but that's par for the course what we're facing.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.299]  Well, the EU has been saying it for six months.
[00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.980]  They've now officially announced their plan.
[00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:13.280]  And I said this two weeks ago.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.939]  It was so obvious it would happen.
[00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:18.079]  They used the tyrants in Brazil as the model.
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.379]  They finally found a way to break Musk.
[00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:21.840]  And I don't blame him.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.680]  I understand he's under a major attack.
[00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:43.650]  And to go along with the government banning certain accounts of their political opposition, including their major political opposition, major senators and others from having X accounts, they started targeting SpaceX and SpaceX His satellite company,
[00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.349]  and all the rest of it.
[00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.870]  Starling.
[00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.909]  Well, now the EU has announced that they're not just going to fine X, 6% of its global revenue as punishment.
[00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.989]  They're going, and they say for, quote, allowing free speech, in quotes.
[00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:00.090]  I have the document right here.
[00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.349]  But that they're going to basically try to seize control of all of his other companies, imitating what...
[00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:10.740]  Brazil did.
[00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:14.919]  So everybody on the fence not defending Elon Musk is an idiot.
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:27.599]  He is devastating the globalists in live time on every front, reaching, it's got to be a billion people a day with stuff, sounds like I said it, documents, videos.
[00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.900]  I mean, he's just slaying them.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.060]  He's grand slamming them.
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.979]  He's hole-in-one-ing them.
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.639]  And then we pray to God for an awakening.
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.259]  We pray to God for people with power to stand up against tyranny.
[00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:42.219]  And then when it comes, eh, it's not perfect.
[00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.360]  Or, you know, 32 million Christians in a big study.
[00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:46.620]  We're not going to vote.
[00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:47.419]  Trump's not perfect.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.060]  You got Satan in you.
[00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:52.659]  You got the devil in you.
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.800]  Musk might turn on us down the road.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.219]  Doesn't mean you totally trust him, but my goodness gracious...
[00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:09.659]  When somebody is blasting the globalists, causing irrevocable damage to their operation, and they're coming after them, the proof's in the pudding.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]  Or as Jesus said, you judge a tree by its fruit.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.300]  So, shame on everybody not backing Trump and Elon Musk or Infowars.
[00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.639]  You are dumber than a box of rocks.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.460]  I see the federally run Q-tards running around.
[00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:32.870]  You know, with all their crap gloating over Infowars being shut down because they run by the CIA. It's just unbelievable.
[00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.409]  Now, that's a big story, and it ties into the tax on us that's major news.
[00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.469]  And if all the other talk show hosts and people don't rally to Infowars, you're next.
[00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.650]  I mean, how many times have you got to see this happen?
[00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.550]  I'm the canary in the coal mine.
[00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:55.000]  But the bigger fish to fry is Musk.
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.340]  He's hurting the globalists a hundred-fold what I am.
[00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:06.979]  Now, Infowars laid the groundwork, the launch pad, and assembled the rocket.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.800]  Musk is just putting it in orbit, literally and figuratively.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.080]  And we created the talking points, the research.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.580]  It's now devastating the enemy across the board.
[00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:24.589]  And we still have important work to do there, creating the analysis that has been adopted by Everyone.
[00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:32.350]  And, you know, the good news is, I can just shoot, if they ever tried to even take me off here completely, I'll just shoot a private briefing video and send it to all the top thought leaders, and you won't stop a damn thing.
[00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.910]  And plus, people have already got their understanding curve up so fast that I will soon be obsolete.
[00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:47.050]  Because we'll be in total martial law, or we'll turn the tide, which we're starting to turn, so there you go.
[00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:49.110]  I'll still have some work to do, but it won't be so desperate.
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.060]  Because we'll either be shut down completely, and you will be too, or we're going to turn the tide.
[00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:55.579]  We'll have lots more work to do.
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.779]  Alright.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.639]  It's finally hit the news, what we reported on two weeks ago.
[00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.959]  The DOD Directive for Martial Law on Killing Americans.
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.459]  Welcome to this Thursday, October 17th, 2024 transmission.
[00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:17.980]  We are only 18 days out from the most important election in world history.
[00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:32.870]  And we are 26 days out to the potential shutdown of the number one longest running pro-human team humanity, pro-God, pro-human transmission in the world.
[00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:34.170]  Vaunted.
[00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:35.709]  Legend.
[00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:37.870]  And it's not about me.
[00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:41.230]  It's about the guests, the films, the crew, and everything we've done together.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:58.720]  Though, I have been working out quite a bit, enjoying it, and just an example of how popular freedom is today, I went into a big gym, and I tried to go over to a corner and work out, and I had about six, seven people walk by and come over,
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.040]  black, white, Hispanic, female, and you know what they all said?
[00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:04.279]  They said the legend.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.480]  Now, that isn't about me.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.920]  That's about the broadcast, everything we do.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:18.379]  But in their minds, after all the demonization and all the attack, I'm being addressed as the legend.
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.720]  Now, how does that tell you the New World Order is doing?
[00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:37.569]  And then that explains why they hate my gut so much, because this broadcast, the guests, the crew, everything we've done, has achieved folk hero status all over the world.
[00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.230]  Tucker Carlson and others have told me, they'll be in Hungary.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.560]  They'll be in Germany.
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.980]  They'll be in the UK. They'll be in Russia.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.920]  They'll be in Japan.
[00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:46.060]  They'll be in Brazil.
[00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:50.500]  And they see people with InfoWars shirts that are homemade or spray painted on the wall.
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.699]  People come up to them and say, you know Alex Jones.
[00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:53.319]  We love you.
[00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:53.819]  We love him.
[00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:55.899]  Again, that isn't about me.
[00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:13.600]  It's about the symbol that I am of a pro-human, pro-God, pro-family populist standing against the establishment, and they've thrown literally thousands of national TV productions and programs, hundreds of documentaries,
[00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:18.980]  hundreds of movies, hundreds of thousands of news articles.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.379]  I mean, some days, I don't even do it anymore.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.560]  I've been looking at Google Alerts.
[00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:26.040]  I would say, you have 14,900 articles.
[00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.930]  And a few of them would be the Alex Jones lady on the BBC. Very lovely lady.
[00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:34.250]  Very nice.
[00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.910]  I guess we could get married and it'd be Mr.
[00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.230]  and Mrs.
[00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.410]  Alex Jones for real.
[00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.009]  Both Alex Jones, both Welsh, I guess.
[00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:41.810]  I got some Welsh in me.
[00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:42.470]  She's pure Welsh.
[00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.649]  The point is, is that, you know, maybe 20 of them are about her.
[00:07:46.829 --> 00:07:48.370]  You know, how is it, you know, tens of thousands.
[00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.810]  One time it was like 35,000 articles.
[00:07:54.069 --> 00:08:05.329]  Well, that's because every publication in the country, at some point, when they're given the order to the CIA that has these pre-programmed systems, they would then report the script they were given.
[00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:08.529]  And, you know, AP is in every local newspaper.
[00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.029]  It's in every local TV station or almost every.
[00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.490]  So, you know, AP would come out.
[00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:16.250]  It would be 8,000 AP same articles.
[00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.269]  That's how you got those numbers.
[00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.430]  But it would still be hundreds of different ones every day.
[00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:21.709]  Saying, I am Satan.
[00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:22.730]  I am the devil.
[00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:23.629]  I am horrible.
[00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.230]  I pee on children's graves.
[00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.670]  I have hundreds of millions of dollars I stole from children.
[00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:30.889]  I murdered children.
[00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:32.250]  I'm Adam Lanza.
[00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:34.909]  I'm racist.
[00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:39.429]  None of it works anymore because people know they're a pack of globalist liars.
[00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:46.289]  So I thought I'd give you the good news, because again, you're not a public figure, which is great.
[00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:53.309]  That is the greatest thing ever, to have anonymity, privacy, people don't know who you are, you're not really getting looked at.
[00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.250]  It's a very positive thing.
[00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:10.669]  But the positive part, there's a lot of negative on being very famous and infamous, as they would have it, notorious is the real word, is that I get to see what's really going on.
[00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:18.769]  I'll wear sunglasses and a ball cap if I'm going to be walking a long way through the city.
[00:09:19.549 --> 00:09:37.929]  Not because I'm disguised, because I'm scared of people, but if I've got places I've got to go, or let's say I'm on a news trip, part of the operation, I will wear sunglasses and wear a ball cap because I want to get up at 6 a.m.,
[00:09:37.929 --> 00:09:39.929]  drink some coffee, maybe go for a five-mile walk.
[00:09:42.299 --> 00:09:46.659]  And I can't do it if I don't cover up who I am.
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:53.860]  I mean, the police stop, the fire department, Amazon trucks, people come out of their houses.
[00:09:54.539 --> 00:09:56.320]  I mean, every 50 yards.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.440]  They run out of restaurants.
[00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:02.620]  And then I don't want to be rude and not talk to them, but I'm trying to get my fat ass moving.
[00:10:03.159 --> 00:10:03.600]  So...
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:14.299]  You can look at polls and see the world waking up and populists getting elected everywhere and Trump super popular and Elon Musk super popular and everybody else that talks about the New World Order now super popular.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.899]  Trump's talking about the globalist New World Order openly.
[00:10:19.759 --> 00:10:27.600]  But until you actually are on the ground and experience it you don't realize how popular freedom is.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:33.500]  So I don't need to look at polls even though they show what I just said to tell you the New World Order is in deep crap.
[00:10:41.089 --> 00:10:48.330]  And I guess it really is true what we've done with God working through us, with all the work we've done in the last 30 years, it is legendary.
[00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:51.169]  But all glory goes to God.
[00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:58.690]  And temporarily, on the ground, with the American people, the credit goes to you.
[00:10:59.769 --> 00:11:01.570]  Alright, I'm going to move on to the big news here.
[00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:04.250]  I've given you the good news, and I don't think you...
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.639]  Just want to hear the good news, do you?
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.179]  I think you want to hear the serious news.
[00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:09.919]  And I think most of you, again, don't know everything I'm saying.
[00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:12.740]  You don't need me to tell you this, but I've got some angles here and some new developments.
[00:11:15.059 --> 00:11:16.940]  The corrupt deep state knows they're cornered.
[00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:17.960]  They know they're in deep trouble.
[00:11:18.059 --> 00:11:22.220]  That's why I just described how popular freedom is to you, just in case you feel isolated and don't know.
[00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:24.399]  Wear an InfoWars t-shirt.
[00:11:24.539 --> 00:11:25.360]  Wear an Alex Jones t-shirt.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.440]  Wear a Trump t-shirt.
[00:11:26.539 --> 00:11:28.399]  You'll find out very quickly how popular freedom is.
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.340]  It's an adventure.
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.340]  Just make your own shirt saying, I hate the New World Order.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.139]  Or I hate Bill Gates.
[00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:39.059]  He'll probably get your dinner bought for you half the time you go out to eat.
[00:11:40.899 --> 00:11:42.159]  By the way, I've talked about this.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.240]  People are all over X now because I see it posted and I've retweeted some of it.
[00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:56.379]  Going, man, I went to a liberal folk festival and I would get 10 supports for every ugly lair.
[00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:02.710]  I mean, it is an adventure to wear a Patriot t-shirt.
[00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.029]  I mean, I don't just say that.
[00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.769]  People are like, my God, it is crazy.
[00:12:05.909 --> 00:12:07.429]  Wow, somebody just bought my dinner.
[00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:08.529]  Somebody just bought me a drink.
[00:12:10.769 --> 00:12:12.529]  I was speeding 20 miles over the speed limit.
[00:12:12.529 --> 00:12:15.049]  Cop pulled me over, saw my shirt, said, hey, I love Alex Jones.
[00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.230]  I mean, it's going down.
[00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.429]  So we are the majority.
[00:12:20.429 --> 00:12:21.529]  We have common sense.
[00:12:21.649 --> 00:12:22.909]  People don't want to eat bugs.
[00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.350]  They don't want to live under a world government.
[00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:29.559]  They don't want to have their sons castrated, their daughter's breasts cut off.
[00:12:30.019 --> 00:12:31.580]  We don't want to be forcibly injected.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.059]  We don't want human trafficking of sex slave children.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:40.419]  I mean, it's really not a surprise that freedom's popular, but that's why they don't want it on the air.
[00:12:41.419 --> 00:12:44.279]  But freedom and courage is infectious, and now it's happening.
[00:12:44.659 --> 00:12:46.000]  So, let me give you the bad news.
[00:12:47.659 --> 00:12:52.980]  Of course, I've made five films on the subject and written books on the subject, and I would say I'm a leading expert on it because...
[00:12:54.139 --> 00:13:02.320]  I discovered it from military whistleblowers 27 years ago, 28 years ago, and I became the black helicopter man in the news.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.860]  That's what they called me.
[00:13:04.179 --> 00:13:11.000]  And I just had the military, because I was on the number one talk station in Central Texas and Fort Hood was listening.
[00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:13.320]  Our ratings came in from Fort Hood, number one.
[00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:24.730]  And I had Fort Hood military, you know, when I do remote sometimes at Fort Hood for the station, I'd go to their big convention center thing and they'd have me over there as part of the event.
[00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.950]  The military would come over and say, hey, listen, we're training to take guns and take on American people.
[00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:31.710]  Have you seen this?
[00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:35.529]  And I mean, repeatedly, we broke secret documents on air.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.500]  Under Clinton and then under Obama and Bush.
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.059]  This is just ongoing.
[00:13:41.299 --> 00:13:44.840]  I was at a San Antonio gun rally 10 years ago, 11 years ago.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.679]  And they go, hey, we're with Army Intelligence.
[00:13:47.799 --> 00:13:48.539]  Here's a secret document.
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.240]  It's not out yet.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:56.500]  And it was Obama preparing civil internment camps and used the term re-education.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.960]  They used the Soviet term re-education.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.039]  And the public was like, that can't be real.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.019]  And it got some coverage.
[00:14:03.139 --> 00:14:04.299]  And then two years later...
[00:14:05.669 --> 00:14:07.250]  The Army declassified.
[00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:12.929]  Just type in Obama U.S. Army re-education camp document.
[00:14:14.129 --> 00:14:16.850]  And you'll get the Army document on the Army website.
[00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:23.370]  And look, I get it back then that Obama was creeping around trying to get the military ready for re-education camps.
[00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.970]  And then of course people at Fort Hood are like, Jesus, this is totally illegal.
[00:14:27.169 --> 00:14:27.950]  Get it to Alex Jones.
[00:14:31.289 --> 00:14:48.370]  But two weeks ago, I saw Elijah Schaefer found a news article with a link to the Department of Defense website saying that the military has been directed by the executive branch and put out a memorandum to prepare for domestic operations,
[00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.289]  civil unrest, martial law, killing U.S. citizens.
[00:14:51.309 --> 00:14:55.929]  I've gone over the document probably ten times since then, but it got no traction.
[00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:00.730]  I mean, yeah, maybe a million views on my coverage, but on X, millions heard it here.
[00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.529]  But nobody else picked it up.
[00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:05.669]  That didn't happen yesterday.
[00:15:07.529 --> 00:15:17.649]  Suddenly, all the other patriots, but kind of patriot-like, picked it up, ended up on Fox News.
[00:15:17.909 --> 00:15:22.330]  It trended top of X and a bunch of other places as the top trend.
[00:15:22.909 --> 00:15:27.720]  Biden-Harris administration's Authorization of military force against Americans.
[00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.230]  And my point is multifaceted there.
[00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:38.149]  Why wasn't that big two weeks ago when Elijah Schaefer was the first person I saw break it and link to it?
[00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.070]  I said, hey, Elijah Schaefer broke this.
[00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.470]  This was signed weeks ago.
[00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:42.169]  That was weeks then.
[00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:43.110]  It was about a month ago now.
[00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.370]  I mean, why isn't it bigger when I say it or Elijah Schaefer?
[00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.549]  You could go to the Army's website, the Pentagon website, and read the damn thing.
[00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:51.450]  We link to it.
[00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:52.590]  I mean, it's not like we're making it up.
[00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:55.129]  But still, it's like, well, that's Alex Jones.
[00:15:56.429 --> 00:15:57.730]  That's Elijah Schaefer.
[00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:59.490]  I mean, we're not quite sure about that.
[00:16:01.399 --> 00:16:13.320]  Here's 15 studies on atrazine attacking mammals, fish, birds, amphibians, and destroying their fertility and turning the majority of them homosexual.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.080]  Well, that's Alex Jones.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.240]  We're not going to look at the study of university.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.100]  And you scroll down to the document.
[00:16:22.179 --> 00:16:23.779]  There's a link to it right on Infowars.com.
[00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.649]  That's from October 8th, but we've been writing about it ever since it broke two weeks ago.
[00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:43.049]  DOD Directive 5240.01, and go to page 13, the Directive of the Secretary of Defense, and just read all about, and by the way, the document's way worse than, I mean, I've already covered this stuff before, because they've done this secretly before.
[00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.590]  The point is, this is public, which means they're getting ready to go operational.
[00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.750]  They have to normalize it with the troops by hiding it in plain view.
[00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:55.649]  Doing it secretly makes it all taboo, and then it leaks, and ooh, we caught them, and said like, yeah, we're getting ready to kill you, big deal.
[00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:58.299]  Yeah, we're shipping kids in, kidnap, big deal.
[00:16:58.399 --> 00:17:00.360]  Yeah, we're starting World War III. Yeah.
[00:17:01.399 --> 00:17:02.740]  Yeah, we hate America.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.839]  And the troops don't like it.
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.279]  This is the criminals that run it.
[00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:12.700]  But, there it is.
[00:17:12.779 --> 00:17:13.880]  Secretary of Defense approval.
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.539]  Go read just that one page of the 20-something pages.
[00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:21.000]  And it's how they're surveilling us and how they're, just all of it.
[00:17:23.299 --> 00:17:41.799]  And then, of course, the government leaves the borders open, brings in all the crime gangs, all the foreign armies, so that we'll need the military domestically, except it'll be controlled, and the military's response will be controlled, so the globalists can look like the heroes and respond to the military uprisings by foreign troops and other terror cells,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:52.160]  and then they'll be the saviors, but the martial law that's brought into, in the disintegration of society, the destabilization, that the left's going to launch...
[00:17:54.579 --> 00:18:15.819]  We're good to go.
[00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:27.569]  Biden put out the official policy report saying the main mission of the Department of Defense and the CIA and all 16 other agencies and the Justice Department is fighting white supremacy.
[00:18:27.569 --> 00:18:28.349]  It's everywhere.
[00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:44.769]  And then they said in the document that Biden put out publicly, white supremacy is not wanting open borders, not wanting lockdowns, not wanting forced shots, criticizing lockdowns.
[00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.450]  All right.
[00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:55.869]  So, the good news is people now know about this, and it was also trending on X. People are going, wait a minute.
[00:18:56.230 --> 00:19:04.849]  Kamala says Trump's going to use troops on us and have martial law, but they removed Biden in a coup and installed her and say she's basically the president now.
[00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:06.829]  She didn't get one vote in the primaries.
[00:19:07.509 --> 00:19:12.950]  And they're saying that they're going to have civil war conditions if Trump wins and not certify him.
[00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:18.240]  And Biden's saying, ha ha ha, we're going to lock up Trump just two days ago again.
[00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:20.740]  People are really seeing through and going, wait a minute.
[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.799]  You're authorizing the military to operate domestically.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.140]  And it describes, you read the whole 20-something page document.
[00:19:26.259 --> 00:19:30.720]  I mean, it's just everything I put in my films, everything I warned you about, but just public.
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.680]  This isn't...
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:37.220]  I mean, the FBI once gave us a secret document.
[00:19:40.019 --> 00:19:42.480]  That's in my second police state film, The Takeover.
[00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:48.509]  And I'm not going to get into when that happened or how that happened, but it's in the film.
[00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:55.990]  The secret document of the military prepared to carry out martial law and take our guns and everything else.
[00:19:56.109 --> 00:19:58.529]  So these documents aren't new.
[00:19:59.329 --> 00:20:02.029]  They're just telling you it now.
[00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:03.269]  Now, what is...
[00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:05.470]  Again, we all talk about betas kept in the dark.
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:20.900]  This operational is out in the open because once the guns are blazing, once the power is off, once there's a cyber attack, once World War III starts, once the race war starts, they got all those cards in play, they're not going to be able to hide the militaries running around killing people.
[00:20:21.849 --> 00:20:26.569]  And the military needs to see them out in the open saying it because that's how you hide it in plain view.
[00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.990]  You don't bring in the military and say, we're trying to take on constitutional terrorists.
[00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:38.130]  You'll be working with local law enforcement to drill to take on right-wing militias that have illegal weapons stockpiles.
[00:20:38.289 --> 00:20:41.349]  That's real drills been done over and over again since Clinton.
[00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:45.170]  Really, Herbert Walker Bush was doing it, but it first leaked under Clinton.
[00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.450]  And we got the documents and I got leaked training videos.
[00:20:49.829 --> 00:20:50.670]  And others did.
[00:20:51.009 --> 00:20:56.630]  The military would send us, all right, here's our training videos of our training at this military base, at that military base.
[00:20:57.009 --> 00:20:58.430]  We're training to kill Americans.
[00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:02.529]  So, now they're like, okay, well, don't hide it.
[00:21:02.609 --> 00:21:03.730]  Just say it's good.
[00:21:08.529 --> 00:21:13.549]  So, that lets you know they took the safety off the gun, it's loaded, and they got it up to our head.
[00:21:14.849 --> 00:21:16.210]  And the military's not our enemy.
[00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.910]  They're being asked to do something illegal.
[00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:35.230]  And again, they're creating a destabilized climate where you got Venezuelan gangs and all these communist Chinese gangs and Islamic gangs activated by the left who they're bringing in and protecting and these assassin teams trying to kill Trump that turns out the FBI and CIA runs mainstream news the last month.
[00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:42.950]  Well, I mean, if you got I mean, there's hundreds of thousands of military age men just from Islamic countries in there that do work for Iran.
[00:21:44.299 --> 00:21:51.819]  So if the United States does start bombing Iran, and Iran does activate those cells, I'll be on air saying we need the U.S. military to put them down.
[00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:53.119]  See how that works?
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:22:11.259]  They put you in a position where you gotta have it, and there's gonna be U.S. citizens working with these Islamic groups and MS-13 groups and Venezuelan gangs, and so now we've been put in a climate Where now they can legitimize this to the military because they've set the country up for a fall.
[00:22:11.779 --> 00:22:13.400]  But here's the spin.
[00:22:13.599 --> 00:22:19.319]  Once they defeat this uprising, once they defeat this threat, then it stays in place.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.180]  But it gets worse.
[00:22:21.359 --> 00:22:27.299]  They're going to have the left uprise claiming it was done because a cop shot an innocent black person or something.
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:28.460]  They're already trying that.
[00:22:28.779 --> 00:22:29.960]  Call it mostly peaceful.
[00:22:30.559 --> 00:22:32.059]  Then it gets out of hand.
[00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:35.650]  Then they stage false flags and say right-wingers are doing it.
[00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:42.690]  Call that a civil war, and then the military comes in and rounds up the leftists and the right-wingers.
[00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:50.089]  Just like you saw over 1,000 arrested from January 6th, most of them totally innocent, did nothing.
[00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:54.569]  The most guilty would have maybe gotten a month in jail on a $5,000 fine.
[00:22:56.049 --> 00:23:01.750]  Kamala Harris bails out people that firebomb federal buildings and attack federal officers with hatchets.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.900]  They don't even get charged.
[00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:10.099]  An old woman walks through velvet ropes with a police waiver in.
[00:23:10.579 --> 00:23:13.519]  Yeah, lady, you get six months in a federal prison.
[00:23:13.619 --> 00:23:14.579]  How's that sound, cupcake?
[00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:19.630]  Owen Schroyer didn't go in the building.
[00:23:19.769 --> 00:23:20.809]  Bullhorn, don't go in.
[00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:21.650]  With me.
[00:23:21.869 --> 00:23:22.970]  They put in the federal filing.
[00:23:23.289 --> 00:23:24.710]  Your Honor, he doesn't work at InfoWars?
[00:23:24.829 --> 00:23:25.490]  That's a lie.
[00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:26.490]  Yes, it's true.
[00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:28.009]  Alex Jones says don't go in.
[00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:30.089]  Owen Schroyer was there instigating.
[00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:31.089]  He went in the building.
[00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:32.210]  Didn't do that.
[00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:33.869]  They don't care.
[00:23:34.089 --> 00:23:35.170]  They don't care.
[00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:36.390]  They don't care.
[00:23:37.869 --> 00:23:41.869]  In the federal filings, we've shown you, they said, Owen doesn't work here.
[00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:44.150]  No, he worked here seven years before that.
[00:23:45.069 --> 00:23:47.190]  Six years before January 6th.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.000]  Now it's even longer.
[00:23:52.759 --> 00:23:56.500]  But they don't care because lying is what they do at the top.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.259]  And they've weaponized most of the judiciary and they think they're going to defeat America.
[00:24:02.559 --> 00:24:07.400]  But boy, Ron Paul, who I love to death, why he came out yesterday.
[00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:12.130]  Or, actually, Tuesday.
[00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:16.130]  And he talked about it and showed the document and said, yeah, they're getting ready for martial law.
[00:24:16.289 --> 00:24:16.450]  And why?
[00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:19.230]  Everybody went, well, it must be real if Ron Paul said it.
[00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:21.970]  Well, all you had to do was follow the links.
[00:24:23.039 --> 00:24:28.019]  On our articles, it would take you right to the Pentagon's website, and we told you go to page 13.
[00:24:28.299 --> 00:24:30.619]  Hell, we write the article and got screenshots of it.
[00:24:30.759 --> 00:24:34.440]  Here's a screenshot of it, and here's a link to the Pentagon.
[00:24:37.039 --> 00:24:37.980]  That's Alex Jones.
[00:24:38.099 --> 00:24:39.839]  You know, he's a little too alarmist.
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.140]  Now, scroll down and show him.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.279]  You know, we can't scroll down.
[00:24:45.299 --> 00:24:45.579]  It's fine.
[00:24:45.799 --> 00:24:46.720]  Let me just show you an overhead shot.
[00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:47.660]  Let's go to overhead shot right here.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:49.759]  So, so...
[00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.849]  This is what we're dealing with.
[00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:54.609]  So lethal force on the American people.
[00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.470]  But you need to read the whole document.
[00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:04.809]  Because if you want to see how martial law is going to go down, it is a total blueprint for it.
[00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:14.549]  But again, they need a cover story for why they're locking in your houses and denying medical care to people having heart attacks and trying to give you poison experimental shots.
[00:25:14.769 --> 00:25:17.430]  We're protecting you from a virus that they made.
[00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:19.789]  And who made the virus?
[00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:22.410]  The Pentagon under Bill Gates and Obama's directive.
[00:25:22.849 --> 00:25:25.329]  And they shipped it to China to have plausible deniability.
[00:25:26.009 --> 00:25:28.789]  I'll blame the Chinese communists in 10 seconds for something if they're guilty.
[00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:32.710]  But they were working there in a co-operation.
[00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:37.650]  But it was old Billy Gates and old Fauci and the Pentagon.
[00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.029]  And it's even mainstream news.
[00:25:39.089 --> 00:25:41.410]  I told you five years ago, four and a half years ago.
[00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:42.390]  But it's mainstream news now.
[00:25:42.569 --> 00:25:43.630]  It was a Pentagon operation.
[00:25:44.089 --> 00:25:46.690]  And the Pentagon told the four different vaccine makers...
[00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:55.690]  What they were supposed to do, and none of it's a vaccine, it's a replicator system for HIV-spiked protein.
[00:25:57.849 --> 00:26:00.309]  Imagine how sensational that statement is, but it's all true.
[00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:10.490]  All right, National Russian TV is live right now, and they want to ask me questions, interview me, so we'll do a simulcast for 15 minutes after the break.
[00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:15.430]  Done this with the BBC, the Japanese, everybody, but I'll go on, though.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.019]  Russian television telling what's going on with our elections.
[00:26:19.819 --> 00:26:20.819]  So we're going to do that.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.839]  You know, the left tells us to don't even touch anything Russian.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.920]  We're not supposed to talk to the Russians.
[00:26:24.079 --> 00:26:24.119]  Why?
[00:26:24.359 --> 00:26:26.000]  Biden hadn't talked to Putin in years.
[00:26:26.299 --> 00:26:30.880]  Well, Kennedy talked to Khrushchev all the time and stopped World War III. We should be talking to the Russians.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.859]  A lot of folks are scared to talk to the Russians.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.900]  A lot of people told Tucker Carlson you shouldn't go talk to Putin.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.019]  We need more discussions, more talk.
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.119]  Very, very important.
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.720]  We'll put Russian TV on screen here as we go out to break so you can see what they're doing.
[00:26:46.299 --> 00:26:54.180]  And then when we come back from break, we're going to be talking to those folks straight ahead for just about 15 minutes.
[00:26:54.319 --> 00:27:00.200]  And then I'm going to plunge into the globalist martial law takeover plan and the different ways they can do it.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.839]  And I'm now very clear on what they're planning.
[00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:04.900]  I don't know exactly what they're going to trigger first, but I've got their number.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.680]  I know you do as well.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.259]  And here's the big thing you need to take away here.
[00:27:09.319 --> 00:27:15.099]  I know you know this, but most of you, for those that don't, exposing this mitigates it massively.
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:23.000]  And the military is listening so they can compare notes with us on air and they'll see I'm telling the truth because I know what I'm talking about.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.420]  And then they'll understand more of what's unfolding and they'll give us intel to understand what's happening.
[00:27:27.619 --> 00:27:29.660]  And together we can save the republic and stop martial law.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.200]  How's that sound?
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.579]  InfoWars is up for sale November 13th.
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.839]  That's 28 days from the time I'm taping this on October 15th.
[00:27:37.259 --> 00:27:39.480]  But regardless what happens to InfoWars, it's just a building.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.880]  The people are the InfoWars.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:41.779]  I'm the InfoWars.
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.220]  So I intend to stay on air.
[00:27:43.339 --> 00:27:46.079]  But to do that, our outside sponsors need your support.
[00:27:46.299 --> 00:27:50.380]  And one of the greatest ones is drjonesnaturals.com, my dad's supplement company.

[00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:34.390]  Alright, here we are, ladies and gentlemen, on the live broadcast.
[00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:41.849]  We have very, very important, massive news and information to cover today.
[00:28:42.869 --> 00:28:46.109]  We're at the most critical juncture in U.S. history.
[00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:51.690]  And all of the secretive military preparation for war with the American people...
[00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:54.250]  Is now public.
[00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.349]  And what does that tell you?
[00:28:56.569 --> 00:29:00.089]  And again, I'm not talking to the audience, the general audience, that is very informed.
[00:29:00.309 --> 00:29:06.809]  We really care about you, but we also care about folks that are tuning in for the first time that do not understand what's going on.
[00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:21.269]  Most of the military are great people, and they're being given cover stories, and for decades, since George Herbert Walker Bush, they've been training in earnest to go up against the American people, but they need cover stories to do it.
[00:29:22.089 --> 00:29:28.950]  Now, we're the closest to them actually trying to end the republic using crises to bring in a permanent emergency.
[00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:31.430]  Civil emergency.
[00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:36.930]  Now, Ron Paul, in the last 48 hours, came out and talked about it.
[00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:45.029]  And the listeners are like, hey, we've already heard this for two weeks from you about the latest public document from the DOD about lethal force against the American people.
[00:29:49.289 --> 00:29:54.690]  But the good news is this trended top story yesterday, even bigger than the Brett Baer interview with the idiot Kamala.
[00:29:55.049 --> 00:30:00.930]  And that's fun to play and show how she's an idiot, but it's really just political fluff at the end of the day.
[00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:07.769]  And we got some of that coming up today, and Roger Stone's joining us with the latest on the campaign and inside baseball in the last 45 minutes of the next hour.
[00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:11.410]  And then I'll continue with news and calls throughout the transmission, but...
[00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:27.650]  I've learned that when I cover something 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, a year ago, two weeks ago, and you have 5, 10 million people hear about it, I've got to come back to it when the general public now actually wants to know what's going on.
[00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:42.450]  But it is very, very ominous when you have this DOD directive and then everything else going on in the background And the talk of how Trump's going to bring in martial law, they're getting you ready for that.
[00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:49.190]  All the Hollywood movies about civil war and a Trumpian character being killed by the military and they're the good guys killing him.
[00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:54.450]  They are really setting the table or the table is set, I would say.
[00:30:58.089 --> 00:31:00.250]  Just a little over two weeks now.
[00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:02.849]  18 days now.
[00:31:04.059 --> 00:31:08.500]  From this incredibly urgent existential election.
[00:31:09.119 --> 00:31:11.579]  So here is former Congressman Dr.
[00:31:11.819 --> 00:31:29.940]  Ron Paul reading the actual document and then I've done this some but I want to go over more of it because if you think them talking about killing American citizens is bad The whole document itself is a compendium of all the preparations that are going on for full out military rule,
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:38.160]  which is always the main staple of living in martial law, North Korea, Nazi Germany, so on and so such, and so forth.
[00:31:38.559 --> 00:31:39.640]  So here's Ron Paul.
[00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:44.160]  But we want to start off with a headline from Zero Hedge.
[00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:45.960]  It's a pretty hot headline.
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:52.619]  U.S. military now is authorized to kill Americans on U.S. soil.
[00:31:52.859 --> 00:31:54.859]  That can't be possible.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:02.259]  This would open up the door for the careless use and more frequent and Legal.
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.019]  It'll be legal now, so nobody will have to worry about that.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.059]  Send in the troops.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.140]  We need you to shoot a couple of these people.
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.900]  They're opposing our policies.
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:15.940]  They're demonstrating against COVID rules or something they'll come up with.
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.240]  So I think it's very, very dangerous.
[00:32:18.759 --> 00:32:19.440]  So here it is.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:25.440]  Now, Zero Hedge picked it up from Armageddon Pros, which is a substack which they often run.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.420]  It says, U.S. military now authorized to kill Americans on U.S. soil?
[00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:39.329]  Just ahead, intriguingly, of November elections, and that was my second thought, the military has granted itself permission to unleash lethal force on the civilian population.
[00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:47.069]  Again, I thought this has got to be an exaggeration, so I went and looked, and actually go to the next one, because this explains what it is.
[00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:48.190]  Now, it's not a law.
[00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:50.509]  It's a DOD directive.
[00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:54.250]  So this is the whole administrative state where they take over.
[00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:55.569]  They don't pass laws.
[00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.150]  They are laws unto themselves.
[00:32:57.529 --> 00:33:00.250]  Go to the next one if you can because this is what they're talking about.
[00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:02.430]  And I went in and I read this secondly.
[00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:10.970]  And it talks about a reissued DOD directive That was reissued just on September 27th, 2024.
[00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:20.769]  It governs the Department of Defense intelligence activities and now includes provisions authorizing lethal force in certain circumstances.
[00:33:21.069 --> 00:33:25.269]  And it supplants the 2016 version, which did not mention that.
[00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:27.849]  So I read all of this, too, which is someone else's analysis.
[00:33:28.029 --> 00:33:30.230]  I said, okay, this sounds even more troubling.
[00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:32.470]  I want to go look at the document itself.
[00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:33.990]  And so go to the next one.
[00:33:34.049 --> 00:33:36.809]  I actually went and looked at the DOD Directive.
[00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:40.329]  It's DOD Directive 5240.01.
[00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:41.809]  Now go to the next one.
[00:33:41.869 --> 00:33:45.710]  I'm just gonna get to this really quick so I can just show people this is on their own website.
[00:33:45.869 --> 00:33:48.289]  Now this is section three of that directive.
[00:33:49.009 --> 00:33:53.609]  Assistance to law enforcement agencies and other civil authorities.
[00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:55.329]  Now go to the next one.
[00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:56.890]  Now this is levels of authority.
[00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:58.930]  This is section 3.3.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:15.739]  Defense intelligence components may provide personnel to assist a federal department or agency, including a federal law enforcement agency or a state or local law enforcement agency, when lives are in danger in response to such a request.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.980]  For such assistance in accordance with the following approval authorities.
[00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:21.400]  Now here are the authorities.
[00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:24.039]  I'm sorry to get so far into the woods here, but go to the next one.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:41.699]  Responding with assets with potential for lethality, and I underline this, I highlighted it, or any situation where it is reasonably foreseeable That providing the requested assistance may involve the use of force that is likely to result in lethal force,
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.019]  including death or serious bodily injury.
[00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:46.119]  I'm sorry to bog the discussion down with that, Dr.
[00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:49.699]  Ball, but I really wanted to hone in on this is their actual document.
[00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:51.159]  It's not just someone's analysis.
[00:34:52.539 --> 00:34:57.179]  It's the actual document, not just someone's analysis.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:12.440]  So, over two weeks ago, like 16 days ago, Elijah Schaefer On his show, gets a tip about it being on the Pentagon website.
[00:35:14.099 --> 00:35:15.219]  And he talks about it.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.800]  And then other groups went and called the Pentagon and got responses.
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:18.739]  Yeah, it's real.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:29.239]  And now they're running from it.
[00:35:30.159 --> 00:35:31.420]  And now people are going, wait.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.559]  Biden says Trump's going to be a dictator and use martial law.
[00:35:35.019 --> 00:35:36.420]  Harris has said it this week.
[00:35:37.519 --> 00:35:41.519]  They're all over their different channels saying it while they're doing this.
[00:35:41.619 --> 00:35:42.980]  And here's the big issue.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:55.659]  Kamala Harris, going back now, what was it, four months ago, was selected.
[00:35:57.599 --> 00:35:59.320]  Biden has a medical emergency.
[00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:00.420]  He disappears.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.659]  Laura Loomer rightfully was the first to report it.
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.480]  The media says she's crazy.
[00:36:07.619 --> 00:36:08.159]  He's fine.
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:10.960]  Later they released the police scanners.
[00:36:11.139 --> 00:36:12.360]  No, he had a medical emergency.
[00:36:12.639 --> 00:36:13.539]  They were taken to the hospital.
[00:36:13.719 --> 00:36:14.639]  Instead they put him on a plane.
[00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:31.760]  Fly him to Delaware, and he disappears for almost eight days, seven and a half days, emerges with his hair sticking up, with a wrinkled suit, stumbling around on a tarmac, and the media says, why are you stepping down from the campaign?
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.000]  He says, what?
[00:36:33.219 --> 00:36:33.920]  I'm not.
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.340]  And wanders off.
[00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:55.880]  And then we have a fake resignation letter put out several days after he disappeared with no watermark, no Office of the President seal, and the signature was completely fake, looked nothing like Joe Biden's signature.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.960]  And no one knows who put it out.
[00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:00.340]  It's just posted on Twitter.
[00:37:01.539 --> 00:37:08.920]  X. On Biden's X. And the media all says, oh, he's resigned from the campaign.
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.679]  And then Pelosi says, yeah, that doesn't look like his signature.
[00:37:15.679 --> 00:37:17.300]  I don't think that letter's from him.
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.719]  Because she knows that's a huge scandal waiting in the wings.
[00:37:32.029 --> 00:37:39.769]  We're good to go.
[00:37:42.059 --> 00:37:48.000]  And now since the last four years there's been lawsuits and cases, everything Trump talked about and we talked about turned out to be true.
[00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:49.400]  In fact, it's worse than we said.
[00:37:49.579 --> 00:37:57.780]  The illegals voting and the same ballots being recounted over and over again and counting in the dead of night when they said the polling tabulation centers were closed.
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:01.219]  So...
[00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.590]  Now they just normalize it and go on 60 Minutes everywhere else.
[00:38:06.869 --> 00:38:10.150]  Yeah, she wasn't elected in the primary to be the candidate.
[00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:11.250]  It's new.
[00:38:11.369 --> 00:38:13.929]  It's never happened in our history, but it's just the way it is.
[00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:16.409]  So, I'm going to say it again.
[00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:19.150]  We're already in a globalist coup.
[00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:40.010]  And then they come out with a DOD directive in the middle of September that nobody picks up on for two weeks And then October rolls around and Elijah Schaefer does a report on it and says Alex Jones is right.
[00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:41.869]  I've been warning of this.
[00:38:45.269 --> 00:38:49.510]  And it doesn't trend, number one, for over two weeks.
[00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:53.429]  And to his credit, Ron Paul two days ago talks about it.
[00:38:53.489 --> 00:38:54.449]  He's got so much credibility.
[00:38:54.949 --> 00:38:57.969]  People actually go, we better go to the DOD website and look at it.
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.059]  So, the point is, we're moving too slow, people.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.480]  My films are free.
[00:39:06.639 --> 00:39:07.380]  Police State 1.
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.599]  Police State 2.
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:11.400]  Police State 3.
[00:39:11.559 --> 00:39:12.179]  Police State 4.
[00:39:12.539 --> 00:39:13.340]  Police State 5.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:20.699]  And everything in this DOD document is in other documents word for word.
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.860]  The difference is...
[00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:31.579]  They're now making it public because what do you do before you roll out a long planned operation?
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:37.059]  You get ahead of it and tailor it so that people are prepared for it.
[00:39:37.219 --> 00:39:49.260]  And that means they're getting ready for civil unrest, martial law, and then we have Pelosi and Biden and Raskin and all of them.
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:57.750]  Hillary, Cheney, Trump is going to create martial law.
[00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:00.269]  Trump is going to create civil unrest.
[00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:04.309]  If he's not elected, he's going to trigger martial law by uprisings.
[00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:16.949]  If he is elected, he's going to trigger martial law because they're getting ready to create the triggers and then blame Trump whether he gets it stolen or whether he wins.
[00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:23.329]  They are, regardless of that, going ahead with this with 18 days of the election.
[00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:26.829]  In fact, they found the clip again two weeks ago, but we didn't play it.
[00:40:26.849 --> 00:40:28.889]  Can you guys find the Biden clip again where he said two weeks ago?
[00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:32.730]  I'm worried about violence after the election.
[00:40:35.469 --> 00:40:46.510]  And you've got Hillary and you've got all the other surrogates running around saying, get rid of the First Amendment because Trump's a threat to democracy.
[00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:48.889]  Oh my gosh.
[00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:58.090]  Whoever's running the Biden-Harris administration, and that's the deep state, and Obama's one of their top strategists.
[00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:02.590]  He's actually at that level in the council.
[00:41:02.769 --> 00:41:03.570]  He's highly respected.
[00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:04.809]  He's calling shots.
[00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:19.860]  You know, they get the orders from the globalists, but then the generals that implement it are people like John Podesta, Senator Blumenthal.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:24.579]  Barack Obama.
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.739]  Before it was Hillary Clinton.
[00:41:31.099 --> 00:41:33.800]  She's not really in charge of anything now, the deep state.
[00:41:34.239 --> 00:41:35.980]  They're kind of rivals with Obama.
[00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:39.320]  You've got different camps in the whole leftist New World Order system.
[00:41:41.179 --> 00:41:48.159]  And so, they are 100% about to pull some major stuff.
[00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:59.650]  And we can look at the different angles of that we have, but we should be asking ourselves, why isn't Trump coming out and saying, you know, it's really strange.
[00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:02.289]  They keep saying, I'm going to have martial law and use the military and everybody.
[00:42:03.369 --> 00:42:24.860]  But whoever's running the Biden-Harris operation, the deep state, whoever's loading her teleprompter, Has told the DOD to issue a public statement they're preparing for war with the people because of imminent civil unrest and terror attacks.
[00:42:28.639 --> 00:42:30.300]  Trump needs to get ahead of this.
[00:42:30.579 --> 00:42:37.699]  But even if Trump isn't going to get ahead of it, because that sounds too alarmist, we have to.
[00:42:38.619 --> 00:42:43.179]  And again, I would ask Trump and his people, and I can call them up, I can get them on the phone.
[00:42:44.679 --> 00:42:48.500]  And, you know, Trump and his people, they'll go, yeah, that's really smart.
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:49.519]  That's really a great idea.
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:51.320]  And then they'll do the opposite.
[00:42:51.659 --> 00:42:52.139]  Sometimes.
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:52.900]  Sometimes they listen.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:59.340]  But it's extremely frustrating.
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:17.239]  I've used the analogy of you drive through a green light and you look over and some drunk or some old lady, those are just cases I've seen, Runs the red light at 60 miles an hour and you go,
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.579]  holy hell, I'm about to get T-boned.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.679]  You make the split-second decision.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.320]  You slam the brakes on, you hit the accelerator.
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:25.280]  How do you get out of the way of this car?
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.800]  And I've dodged him a few times.
[00:43:27.019 --> 00:43:28.360]  A few times I haven't dodged him.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:35.260]  Those are the wrecks I've had as a tornado blew us off the road once, me and my dad coming back from Fredericksburg.
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:38.780]  It's got to be 16, 17 years ago now.
[00:43:39.099 --> 00:43:43.010]  And the other times I've had people run red lights and Hit me.
[00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:45.090]  And time slows down.
[00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:48.929]  And that's how I feel with 18 days of the election.
[00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:55.250]  I'm just sitting there watching them totally get ready for martial law and flipping all the switches and they've got it all ready.
[00:43:55.969 --> 00:43:57.510]  The other analogy is like a meal.
[00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:04.190]  The table's set, the candles are lit, the kitchen door is there, the doors are opening, and here come the dishes.
[00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:07.909]  And they've got covers on the dishes, but I can smell them.
[00:44:07.989 --> 00:44:12.010]  And I'm like, that smells, that doesn't smell like a delicious ham or a turkey.
[00:44:13.409 --> 00:44:14.690]  That doesn't smell like roast beef.
[00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:16.530]  No, that smells like death.
[00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:17.610]  That smells like martial law.
[00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:22.210]  And of course, I've been in the kitchen over the years, 30 years on air.
[00:44:22.289 --> 00:44:23.750]  I know what they cook in the kitchen.
[00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:31.750]  So, they're bringing the dishes over, and I can smell the stench of death, and I'm like, boy, this is really bad, folks.
[00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:39.630]  So, here we are.
[00:44:41.869 --> 00:44:52.289]  And I can harp on this until the cows come home, but stage violent attacks on Harris or Biden.
[00:44:52.429 --> 00:44:54.949]  They could kill Biden, say Trump supported it, kill Harris.
[00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.730]  They don't even do that.
[00:44:55.909 --> 00:44:59.369]  Or try to kill her, or say they tried to kill her and blame us.
[00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:03.630]  Truck bombings, any big gathering of black people, so they'll hit a...
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.380]  Mass shooting in a black grocery store.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.260]  I predicted two weeks before they actually did it in Buffalo.
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:09.039]  Remember that a few years ago?
[00:45:10.519 --> 00:45:12.280]  So they'll probably hit a black grocery store in the next few weeks.
[00:45:13.219 --> 00:45:13.880]  Something like that.
[00:45:14.179 --> 00:45:16.619]  And also said black church, black college.
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:26.760]  Wherever there's a bunch of black people, they'll truck bomb it because that's easy to then cover up and then say the Patsy, you know, died the bomb or something.
[00:45:27.659 --> 00:45:43.179]  I mean, that's their MO. Or They shoot Trump's plane out of the sky with a service-to-air missile and say Iran did it, and then kill two birds with one stone and go to war with Iran,
[00:45:43.179 --> 00:45:44.539]  and that's your big October surprise.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:52.019]  Or they do the big cyber attack and knock out a bunch of the power communications to disrupt the election.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:56.420]  They have an excuse to have a bunch of battleground states go on past November 5th.
[00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:00.289]  And the FBI and the Department of Defense put out memos.
[00:46:00.429 --> 00:46:04.510]  Oh yeah, Trump supporters are going to get violent when the election goes longer.
[00:46:04.809 --> 00:46:07.530]  In 60 minutes, oh imminent, Trump's going to cause violence.
[00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:09.429]  I mean, you see him scripting it.
[00:46:10.429 --> 00:46:18.230]  I wonder if some new big hurricane will form and just magically smack right into the conservative areas of battleground states on the East Coast.
[00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:34.820]  And then with this climate of all these foreign fighters and military-age men here, And Trump's saying, I want Army Special Operations to protect me because the Secret Service can't because Biden won't give him enough Secret Service.
[00:46:39.019 --> 00:46:43.099]  And so there's a backdrop of...
[00:46:44.469 --> 00:46:51.530]  It'll look like we need the military because we will because we've been put in a position of that crisis.
[00:46:51.769 --> 00:46:52.849]  See how that works.
[00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:56.570]  And now the president said, put that New Yorker magazine headline back up.
[00:46:56.929 --> 00:47:03.550]  Yeah, there's so many headlines every day, everywhere in corporate media and the Atlantic Monthly is the CIA mouthpiece.
[00:47:03.809 --> 00:47:05.130]  It's actually the Jeffrey Epstein headline.
[00:47:06.949 --> 00:47:10.389]  Basically the magazine is published or was published literally from Epstein Island.
[00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:14.329]  The owner of it is one of the most frequent attendees.
[00:47:15.429 --> 00:47:16.590]  Steve Jobs' wife.
[00:47:17.389 --> 00:47:21.210]  Martial law would sweep the country into a great legal unknown.
[00:47:22.469 --> 00:47:30.570]  The prospect while still remote is purely hypothetical in the current crisis and the risk is great.
[00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:31.510]  Oh.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.679]  So, and you got New York Times headlines.
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.380]  Time to get rid of the Constitution.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:39.880]  Another New York Times headline.
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.480]  Don't ask questions.
[00:47:41.599 --> 00:47:42.320]  That's disinformation.
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:48.179]  And now official publications for young children in public school tell them, don't ask questions.
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:49.300]  Don't question.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.539]  And now Trump has asked...
[00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:09.460]  For military aircraft that have flares on them and alarms so that if a service-to-air missile is fired, they fire flares so the heat-seeking missile doesn't go right into the engine.
[00:48:10.139 --> 00:48:14.039]  And then the media spins that like Trump wants martial law.
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:19.219]  No, the military 100% can have that function of defense and protection.
[00:48:19.599 --> 00:48:25.380]  And the military can be called out by governors, by the president, you know, if there is a major terror attack.
[00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:42.289]  But when you go to the training that I put in my films, it's even been on local and national news, what you saw in Katrina for gun confiscation, the main focus and in O'Biden's June 2021 national directive is to take on Trump supporters.
[00:48:43.869 --> 00:48:51.570]  And we've seen all of this big push everywhere.
[00:48:57.639 --> 00:48:59.579]  To normalize this in America.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.019]  So, the system's going to lose if they don't create a big crisis.
[00:49:07.639 --> 00:49:09.260]  And so they're going to create a big crisis.
[00:49:09.679 --> 00:49:12.559]  How do we get ahead of it and expose them and stop them?
[00:49:12.659 --> 00:49:20.860]  And how do we make a move where, okay, that car, split-second decision, that car's about 50 yards, 40 yards, split-second.
[00:49:23.199 --> 00:49:25.280]  Well, this is your brain in like a millisecond.
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:26.539]  Well, I'm driving a high-powered car.
[00:49:27.619 --> 00:49:28.559]  Let me look in front of me.
[00:49:28.679 --> 00:49:31.000]  Okay, the other car's 50 yards ahead of me.
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.420]  I can do rapid acceleration.
[00:49:33.659 --> 00:49:34.699]  All done in a millisecond.
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.579]  And car misses you.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:37.760]  Barely.
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.519]  And that's where, but see, we got to make the decision.
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:52.039]  And it'd be a lot easier if we got Elon Musk talking about this, and Trump talking about it, and Tucker already is, and Joe Rogan.
[00:49:53.239 --> 00:50:05.880]  Because once they get their permanent civil emergency, we'll call it, martial law in place, then they can have new lockdowns and new forced injections and internet kill switches and shutting down other talk show hosts and disappearing people and lawfare.
[00:50:06.059 --> 00:50:09.039]  And the climate gets a lot darker in that scenario.
[00:50:09.179 --> 00:50:11.219]  And you say, well, would they dare do that?
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:15.099]  That's their only move other than backing off and capitulating.
[00:50:17.269 --> 00:50:21.750]  Alright, I'm going to talk about the attacks on free speech that have gone to the next level against Elon Musk, myself and others.
[00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:25.070]  Biggest developments yet on multiple fronts.
[00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:26.650]  I'll cover that the first 20 minutes of the next hour.
[00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:30.289]  Then Roger Stone joins us with a bunch of big breaking political news and inside baseball.
[00:50:31.519 --> 00:50:39.300]  Please remember, as you see all over the news, the feds have filed to take my name and say I can't use my name and Real Alex Jones and take it away from me and steal my identity.
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:40.619]  We can beat it in court.
[00:50:40.719 --> 00:50:44.079]  It's going to take legal actions and federal battles and it will go on.
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:49.500]  And that alone will cost $300,000 in the next six months.
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.219]  They'll spend millions against me.
[00:50:51.719 --> 00:50:56.960]  Well, if you go to realalexjones.com, that's the Give, Send, Go account, we haven't raised $300,000 yet.
[00:50:57.099 --> 00:50:58.059]  I haven't checked it today.
[00:50:58.159 --> 00:50:58.480]  Let's pull it.
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:50:59.980]  It was like $280,000 yesterday.
[00:51:00.869 --> 00:51:02.849]  And I've got four other legal actions I've got to fight.
[00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:05.469]  Trump needs hundreds of millions to beat all the fake crap on him.
[00:51:05.650 --> 00:51:06.489]  I just need millions.
[00:51:06.949 --> 00:51:07.110]  Okay?
[00:51:07.429 --> 00:51:10.949]  So go to realalexjones.com and make a donation there.
[00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:13.030]  The Legal Defense Fund.
[00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:18.110]  realalexjones.com realalexjones.com I mean, it's not like I'm playing games here.
[00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:20.010]  It's not like the enemy doesn't try to get us off the air.
[00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:20.929]  It's not like we're not effective.
[00:51:21.659 --> 00:51:23.400]  So if you don't bet on us, you're betting against yourself.
[00:51:23.619 --> 00:51:24.599]  I want to thank those that have supported.
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.199]  I want to encourage those that are on the fence.

[00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:58.710]  Alright, I am going to lay out more of the globalist martial law plan that they are openly implementing now in live time.
[00:53:58.869 --> 00:54:01.349]  That doesn't mean they won't back off of it, but it's being implemented.
[00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:03.449]  Something this big, they've got to start rolling.
[00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:07.829]  That's coming up with myself and Roger Stone in the next segment, but first, this important message.
[00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:29.550]  Mm-hmm.
[00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:32.929]  I went back to NBC. We had all these fact checkers.
[00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:34.090]  It was all true.
[00:54:34.269 --> 00:54:36.250]  We found out all this stuff he was saying was true.
[00:54:36.469 --> 00:54:44.409]  And here I am across from you, Harvard-educated Johns Hopkins, attending physicians, saying, yeah, fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good.
[00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:45.190]  It's crazy.
[00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:46.730]  Yeah, it's simple.
[00:54:47.469 --> 00:54:55.050]  It's because what I've been covering on the air for over 30 years is from the globalists' own documents, their own battle plans, their own white papers, their own publications.
[00:54:55.869 --> 00:55:04.710]  And when I first got on air 30 years ago, I looked back at what the globalists said they would do in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, early 90s, and I saw that they'd gotten almost all of it done.
[00:55:05.619 --> 00:55:13.000]  So then I said, while these folks pretty much are in control, trying to get full control, I'd better look into what their future plans were.
[00:55:13.519 --> 00:55:15.019]  And it's absolutely hellish.
[00:55:15.099 --> 00:55:24.579]  80% forced global depopulation, making the humans that are still alive be biomedically controlled with poisons and things introduced to their bodies when they're young, so the medical system has...
[00:55:24.929 --> 00:55:35.849]  Complete control over you the rest of your life, no borders, the destruction of the nuclear family, pedophilia being normalized, literally a satanic world government system.
[00:55:36.489 --> 00:55:41.130]  And if you look at everything that we've been exposing, it's all out in the open now.
[00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:43.730]  The enemy has taken off the mask.
[00:55:43.889 --> 00:55:53.000]  And they knew that as this system goes from beta to operational, as it begins to emerge in everybody's face, That we're going to have incredible credibility.
[00:55:53.539 --> 00:55:55.440]  And that's why they need us off the air.
[00:55:55.679 --> 00:55:59.800]  Because my work, my most important work, isn't the past.
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:02.199]  It's what we're going to do in the present and the future.
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:19.099]  So regardless of what happens to Infowars, in 28 days from the time I'm taping this, on Tuesday, October 15th, if you simply support our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, We will work with the sponsor and ensure that not just my show, but our investigative reports and everything that we're currently doing,
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:22.400]  and hopefully in the future expanding, continues on.
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:24.679]  But we cannot do it without you.
[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:27.599]  So when you call in thanking me, I always say back, what?
[00:56:27.679 --> 00:56:28.380]  I want to thank you.
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:30.400]  You're the reason we're still on air.
[00:56:30.519 --> 00:56:32.840]  You're the reason we've had all this incredible success.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.300]  So I salute you and thank you for your past support.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.239]  And I tell you now, look at the world.
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:38.340]  Look at our credibility.
[00:56:38.519 --> 00:56:39.719]  Look at everything that's happening.
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:43.599]  The public's mind and hearts and souls are ready for the truth.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:46.199]  And our most important work is just now beginning.
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:48.980]  So please, keep me on the air one way or another.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.159]  It's in your hands, not the globalist hands.
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:52.239]  They're not in control of this.
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:52.719]  It's you.
[00:56:53.170 --> 00:57:02.150]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com, get incredible supplements like Ultimate Seamoss Gummies, and now we have the powdered pills that are twice as strong as the gummies.
[00:57:02.389 --> 00:57:05.070]  It is the superfood.
[00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:09.889]  It is mixed with a whole bunch of other incredible superfoods that turbocharge it.
[00:57:09.969 --> 00:57:18.230]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com and look at the ingredients and research them for yourself, and then most importantly, order a bottle and try it, and I know you're going to be hooked.
[00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:19.550]  You're going to love it.
[00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:34.409]  Stamina, libido, Focus, energy, your health, your immune system, all electrochemical activities have to have iodine, and that's just one of the naturally occurring compounds that is in the Ultimate Sea Moss from Irish Sea Moss and more.
[00:57:34.889 --> 00:57:41.769]  And then, ladies and gentlemen, all of these amazing Patriot Design t-shirts, hoodies, and ball caps, new ones are being added every day.
[00:57:41.909 --> 00:57:44.969]  There's over 120 different designs on the site.
[00:57:55.050 --> 00:58:10.610]  Yeah, back when Alice Cooper wrote this song 35,
[00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:11.650]  40 years ago...
[00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:16.670]  If the mainstream news said you were a bad guy, nobody wanted to be seen with you.
[00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:17.289]  Nobody liked you.
[00:58:17.909 --> 00:58:26.110]  But now the corporate media is so discredited and so hated, rightfully so, as the enemy of the people, it's a total endorsement.
[00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:34.130]  And only the dumbest morons hate you if the system that's destroying everybody is attacking you.
[00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:42.409]  Alright, so I spent most of the last hour not talking about Kamala acting like a complete witch on Bret Baier.
[00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:57.670]  We got some clips of that with Roger Stone coming up, and it is important, but it doesn't even begin to get close to the Democrat Party, Kamala Harris, Biden,
[00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:58.630]  all these puppets.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:10.659]  And whoever's running the Biden-Harris administration, we know that's the deep state, whoever loads the teleprompter, saying martial law and civil unrest and civil war are imminent.
[00:59:10.659 --> 00:59:36.750]  Now, we knew they were going to push this officially right before the election because in the last year there have been Netflix shows produced by Obama about martial law and right-wing, left-wing civil war and giant budget movies called Civil War and literally that I've seen hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of leftist articles and professors and pundits Both saying we're going to round up all the Trump supporters and we're going to deprogram them and we're going to re-educate them and we're going to burn them down and these are quotes.
[00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:42.349]  And then separately claiming Trump's going to politically persecute us, he's going to have martial law.
[00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:56.690]  And now, it's not just their surrogates, it's the top puppets themselves are saying this is imminent while they've opened the borders, brought in the foreign military-aged men, got all the preparations ready.
[00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:13.780]  Remember just five weeks ago, it was all over local news in Texas and Colorado and Illinois and New York and about Venezuelan gangs taking over places, robbing people, killing people, shooting people, and being let out by Soros prosecutors.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.880]  The governor of Colorado said it was a fantasy.
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:33.710]  Well, now the Houston Chronicle is reporting that That a evil super gang has seized four apartment complexes in major Texas City in new terrifying show of strength.
[01:00:33.909 --> 01:00:37.469]  And there's videos and photos of it on the local news in San Antonio.
[01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:45.809]  And video of them beating up apartment managers that don't give them half the money and don't let them take over.
[01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:48.510]  And they come to people's doors and shove guns in their faces.
[01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:52.650]  But wait a minute, the Democrats told me that didn't exist.
[01:00:57.579 --> 01:01:27.929]  Austin, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, El Paso All the local news report on the Venezuelan gangs Let me tell you about some of them in New York Got a bunch of those here Little devil Venezuelan terror teen busted again for New York City
[01:01:27.929 --> 01:01:29.250]  armed robberies.
[01:01:29.789 --> 01:01:32.989]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:34.070]  Unsustainable.
[01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:37.030]  Indiana residents sound alarm after a city overwhelmed by illegals.
[01:01:37.929 --> 01:01:39.210]  Same everywhere.
[01:01:40.269 --> 01:01:43.130]  And that's why there's a new big study out.
[01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:47.429]  Trust in corporate media drops to all-time low.
[01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:50.710]  Almost no one...
[01:01:52.349 --> 01:01:54.070]  Believes any of their crap.
[01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:02.030]  Well, I didn't send a crew because our crew's been crushed down to almost nothing.
[01:02:02.429 --> 01:02:03.710]  But we don't have an excuse.
[01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:05.329]  San Antonio's an hour away.
[01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:07.250]  Maybe 70 minutes with traffic.
[01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:09.949]  And you can just go.
[01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.929]  There's newscasts.
[01:02:11.010 --> 01:02:11.550]  You can go send them.
[01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:13.010]  Ain't guns that you can take it out of here.
[01:02:13.909 --> 01:02:14.570]  Police do nothing.
[01:02:18.389 --> 01:02:19.530]  Sanctuary City.
[01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:32.690]  And in California and in Texas and all over, at the local school boards, parents come in and say, hey, MS-13 is trying to recruit my 11-year-old.
[01:02:32.929 --> 01:02:35.969]  And the school says, well, we allow MS-13.
[01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:39.889]  They're citizens, or they're not citizens, but they get the same rights too.
[01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:45.130]  Remember what Hillary...
[01:02:46.949 --> 01:02:48.269]  You know, said about the gangs.
[01:02:48.369 --> 01:02:49.550]  Remember what Pelosi said about them?
[01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:51.369]  They're all God's children.
[01:02:53.710 --> 01:03:00.389]  So, you have all the Islamic military age groups coming in with the same backpack, same clothing, same boots, clearly military.
[01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:02.510]  The Chinese military coming in.
[01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:05.429]  The Pentagon confirms what's going on.
[01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:11.269]  You've got Chinese government setting up bases next to military bases all over the country, right here in Texas.
[01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:19.150]  You got drone swarms coming into the most secret nuclear bases and then nothing's done to shoot them down.
[01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:25.769]  But low-flying, 20-foot-long drones just show up with eight propellers.
[01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:33.590]  The defunding of the police.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:47.320]  Over a thousand towns and cities under the control of Soros, DAs and county attorneys letting, as long as they're leftist criminals committing crime they want, as long as they're not white, starting to get what's happening.
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:04:06.320]  They're trying to prime the gangs to have uprisings and to do whatever they want as long as it's racially motivated against whites because the media is going to frame it that it's a race war and have some excuse because some cop Might hurt an innocent brown person or black person.
[01:04:08.179 --> 01:04:14.940]  And that will be the trigger, but on a bigger scale, just like the summer of love and the mostly peaceful protest in 2000.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.900]  And we're 18 days out from it.
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:22.500]  And they have the clip of Biden.
[01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:23.059]  Let's pull it up.
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:25.820]  He said this a bunch, but here's one of the clips a few weeks ago.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.719]  He's like, oh, I'm really worried about after the election.
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:28.619]  I'm worried about violence.
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.480]  And they have generals on 60 Minutes.
[01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:33.420]  Oh, yeah.
[01:04:34.059 --> 01:04:39.440]  Trump people are going to get violent when the votes don't get counted the first night.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.840]  They're going to supply the violence and blame us.
[01:04:43.119 --> 01:04:44.679]  This is all happening.
[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:48.139]  It's as plain as the nose on anybody's face.
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.019]  There's not even a debate about it.
[01:04:50.739 --> 01:04:51.659]  They're openly...
[01:04:51.659 --> 01:04:56.639]  This real Pentagon document that's on the Pentagon website, I'll show you a shot of it right now.
[01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:05.570]  Isn't just about the Pentagon will use lethal force on Americans.
[01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:12.269]  When you read it, it's all about surveillance, control, civil unrest, breakdown of society, martial law.
[01:05:12.929 --> 01:05:13.829]  Go read it.
[01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:16.090]  Go read the table of contents.
[01:05:16.269 --> 01:05:17.630]  It's only 20-something pages long.
[01:05:19.329 --> 01:05:21.170]  Read page 13 and 14.
[01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:25.070]  But read the whole thing.
[01:05:27.719 --> 01:05:33.739]  And it's all about control of the internet, control of power, control of the people, armed troops, take over local governments.
[01:05:37.519 --> 01:05:38.500]  Command and control.
[01:05:44.159 --> 01:05:45.460]  Look at page 12.
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.079]  Oh, that's a really important page that nobody's covering.
[01:05:50.019 --> 01:05:51.639]  Federalizing the law enforcement.
[01:05:52.079 --> 01:05:54.900]  And I told you it's an executive order that's been reauthorized by Biden.
[01:05:56.219 --> 01:06:00.690]  EO12333. But we know Biden's not really in control.
[01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:05.889]  Look at page 13.
[01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:09.150]  Secretary of Defense approval.
[01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:16.429]  Any type of assistance.
[01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:25.750]  A result of lethal force including death and serious bodily injury of U.S. citizens.
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:43.559]  And it's got all the approval for it, and the considerations, and all the training, and all the preparation, and the glossary, and all the executive orders.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:50.179]  And see, when I reported on this weeks ago, I said it's a new executive order, and people go, no, no, no, it's just a DOD directive.
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:53.639]  No, it's a directive off of the executive order.
[01:06:53.719 --> 01:06:57.039]  So let me show you the executive orders you might want to go read.
[01:06:58.659 --> 01:07:01.119]  It's on page 18.
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:02.539]  Term definitions.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:05.159]  Definition of IC Directive 304.
[01:07:05.699 --> 01:07:09.579]  Defense intelligence defined DOD 514301.
[01:07:12.239 --> 01:07:18.320]  Defense intelligence components defined DOD DM 5240.1.
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:19.179]  I'm going to go read these.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:24.780]  Employees defined executive order 1-2-3-3-3-3.
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:28.420]  Foreign intelligence defined EO 1-2-3-3-3.
[01:07:28.599 --> 01:07:30.440]  Name anybody they don't like as a foreign power.
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:31.940]  Enemy combatant.
[01:07:32.079 --> 01:07:34.739]  IC defined EO 1-2-2-3-3-3.
[01:07:35.099 --> 01:07:37.739]  Intelligence defined EO 1-2-2-3-3-3.
[01:07:38.699 --> 01:07:40.500]  It's all in EO 1-2-3-3-3.
[01:07:41.199 --> 01:07:46.960]  Reissued by Biden with new parameters.
[01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:52.170]  And again, not really by Biden.
[01:07:55.329 --> 01:07:56.849]  I haven't gotten to this yet.
[01:07:56.849 --> 01:07:57.789]  I mentioned it.
[01:07:57.869 --> 01:07:59.670]  I will do it after Roger leaves us.
[01:07:59.969 --> 01:08:01.510]  But also bring it up to Roger.
[01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:07.789]  But meanwhile, federal employees are worried about the return of Donald Trump to the White House and martial law.
[01:08:07.949 --> 01:08:09.550]  They're panicked by it.
[01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:13.409]  Just like Harris said two days ago, he's going to use the military on the people.
[01:08:15.289 --> 01:08:16.689]  And Trump doesn't go funny.
[01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:18.090]  He just signed an executive order.
[01:08:19.289 --> 01:08:29.590]  To nationalize the election and not certify the winner if they say, with no evidence, foreign intelligence was involved.
[01:08:34.449 --> 01:08:37.069]  And executive orders for martial law.
[01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:45.590]  That's what this executive order and the corresponding DOD memorandum directive is.
[01:08:52.189 --> 01:09:05.390]  So, you tie that in with free speech alert, Dems launch federal court filing in bid to take over major MAGA X accounts.
[01:09:06.489 --> 01:09:14.310]  Alex Jones bankruptcy trustee aims as a federal Justice Department person to sell social media accounts, including real Alex Jones and the name Alex Jones.
[01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:18.109]  And he says it doesn't violate the 13th Amendment because Alex Jones is not a normal person.
[01:09:18.289 --> 01:09:20.789]  It actually says it in Bloomberg and in the federal filing.
[01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:23.130]  You cannot make it up.
[01:09:23.289 --> 01:09:28.630]  I did a whole hour on it live last night from the Alex Jones Network X account that you definitely want to follow.
[01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:38.710]  AJNLive.com We'll put that on screen as a URL. At AJNLive.
[01:09:38.829 --> 01:09:40.270]  That's a new thing for you to follow.
[01:09:41.369 --> 01:09:43.710]  Or you can roll over and give up.
[01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:50.689]  And it says right here that it doesn't violate the 13th Amendment because Alex Jones is different.
[01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:56.569]  Alex Jones' social media accounts are not the ordinary accounts of a private citizen.
[01:09:56.810 --> 01:09:57.189]  Oh, really?
[01:09:58.010 --> 01:09:59.449]  So I don't...
[01:09:59.449 --> 01:10:00.449]  The sale of that...
[01:10:00.449 --> 01:10:01.090]  This is the document.
[01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:02.630]  The Alex Jones Bankruptcy Estate...
[01:10:03.479 --> 01:10:13.500]  Interest in the social media accounts does not require Alex Jones to perform any personal services that would otherwise violate the 13th Amendment, the federal agent said.
[01:10:15.279 --> 01:10:16.859]  But the 13th Amendment is very clear.
[01:10:16.939 --> 01:10:29.699]  You can't take somebody's name or likeness, and the X terms of service are they let people be on there as a platform, and you can't transfer your private identity to somebody else.
[01:10:29.699 --> 01:10:30.739]  It's identity theft.
[01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:35.250]  And we've hired big top law firms to look at it, do our own filings.
[01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:36.770]  They're like, 100% they can't do this.
[01:10:36.829 --> 01:10:43.170]  They said, oh, the trustee's not going to try this, even though the Sandy Hook families, being Democratic Party, have asked for it previously.
[01:10:43.529 --> 01:10:44.609]  Remember the headline in Reuters?
[01:10:44.970 --> 01:10:49.350]  Sandy Hook families want Alex Jones' name and his social media.
[01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:52.010]  And they say in the federal filing, we own the name Alex Jones.
[01:10:53.789 --> 01:10:57.270]  Like I'm Prince and signed a deal with Sony that they own my name and likeness.
[01:10:57.390 --> 01:10:57.630]  No.
[01:10:58.069 --> 01:10:59.649]  My whole show's always been free to air.
[01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:01.770]  And that ties in with this.
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:21.260]  The EU has now officially come out and said they're not just going to fine X 6% of their gross profit every year for, quote, allowing free speech, as he says in the document, but they're now going to start seizing his other companies like SpaceX,
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:28.100]  Starlink, his Boeing sector, and Tesla.
[01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:39.449]  I told you when he caved in to the Brazilian tyrant that they would use that tactic now at the EU, and they are.
[01:11:39.550 --> 01:11:40.170]  Not hard to predict.
[01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:56.119]  So they're openly saying Trump is going to use the military as the people while they put out an executive order that then becomes a directive For the military, for martial law, and the total takeover of society, everybody's focusing on the lethal force on citizens.
[01:11:56.119 --> 01:11:57.300]  That's just page 13.
[01:11:57.399 --> 01:12:00.000]  That's just one paragraph from the Secretary of Defense.
[01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:02.420]  Yeah, that's sensational.
[01:12:02.699 --> 01:12:03.720]  That's incredible.
[01:12:04.399 --> 01:12:07.079]  But it's the whole document I discovered last hour.
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:15.000]  So, you've seen all this stuff before in my films and books when it was secret and leaked.
[01:12:16.739 --> 01:12:20.000]  The difference is now they're making it public.
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:38.079]  Meaning they're getting ready to do it and when they create the conditions of civil unrest or terror attacks or false flags or Trayvon Martin or any of it 2.0 George Floyd 2.0 that it's Trump's fault.
[01:12:38.939 --> 01:12:41.600]  So they're getting ready to make their move.
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:43.479]  Exposing them I believe can stop them.
[01:12:43.539 --> 01:12:44.739]  I want to get into this with Roger Stone.
[01:12:46.079 --> 01:12:49.680]  18 days is just this epic referendum against globalism.
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:51.260]  He's very optimistic.
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:52.000]  I am too.
[01:12:52.659 --> 01:12:55.979]  The numbers are Trump just continues to surge past their level of fraud.
[01:12:56.119 --> 01:12:57.300]  That's why they tried to kill him twice.
[01:12:58.899 --> 01:13:16.930]  Trump, as I told you before, now it's mainstream news, has asked for military C-130s that have flares on them and have anti-service-to-air missile sensors so that if a service-to-air missile is launched at Trump Force One, The C-130 flying beside it shoots out the flares,
[01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:19.090]  and the missile hits the flares.
[01:13:20.069 --> 01:13:21.130]  Guys, just show people.
[01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:30.310]  Type in helicopters launch anti-missile defense, C-130s launch anti-service-to-air missile defense.
[01:13:31.029 --> 01:13:35.890]  And everybody's seen it, but you see the C-130 where the flares go out, helicopter flares go out.
[01:13:36.859 --> 01:13:38.659]  Because they won't give him the Secret Service he needs.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:42.840]  So then he says, okay, can I get DOD? That's not Trump wanting martial law.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.500]  That's a constitutional function.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.199]  The military can protect him.
[01:13:46.659 --> 01:13:50.399]  If the Secret Service can't provide the protection, that's the federal law.
[01:13:51.100 --> 01:14:00.800]  This is the military taking over and killing citizens at the behest of the Obama third term if they get his fourth term via fraud.
[01:14:02.330 --> 01:14:04.050]  So, that's the big meat and potatoes.
[01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:06.489]  We've got a lot of other big developments with Roger Stone with the balance of the hour.
[01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:12.170]  Stonezone.com, former chief political advisor to President Trump and close confidant.
[01:14:12.329 --> 01:14:13.329]  Roger, good to have you here.
[01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:18.050]  Wow, everything I talked about decades ago from the documents is now not secret.
[01:14:18.109 --> 01:14:19.310]  It's out in the open to me.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.359]  I don't think it's to me.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:21.800]  It's clear.
[01:14:21.939 --> 01:14:26.220]  They're telegraphing Biden saying he's worried about violence during and after the election.
[01:14:26.699 --> 01:14:30.380]  They've got all these former generals on TV that are globalists saying the same thing, that Trump's going to get violent.
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:33.819]  Clearly, they're preparing to stage some violence and blame Trump and Trump supporters.
[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:34.939]  What do you think, Roger?
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:43.720]  Yeah, I'm gonna order one of those Alex Jones was right t-shirts right after the show, cuz you called all of this.
[01:14:44.079 --> 01:14:50.720]  Alex, the same thing jumped out at me in Kamala Harris's disastrous interview with Brett Baer.
[01:14:51.159 --> 01:14:56.779]  She said, we quoted exactly, Donald Trump wants to turn the military on the American people.
[01:14:56.939 --> 01:15:08.079]  No, actually, it's her administration that has just released these DOD regulations that allow them to use lethal force against Americans.
[01:15:09.529 --> 01:15:17.810]  It's mind-boggling, but as you go through these lists, she took responsibility for nothing.
[01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:21.529]  She continues to promulgate the same lies over and over again.
[01:15:21.609 --> 01:15:26.550]  No, the Lankford border bill would not have secured our border.
[01:15:26.869 --> 01:15:35.250]  It would have allowed the grandfathering of 2 million illegals in the country every year, about 150,000 a month.
[01:15:35.670 --> 01:15:38.270]  Most of the money in the bill went to Ukraine.
[01:15:38.770 --> 01:15:41.890]  More money went to Ukraine than went to sealing the border.
[01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:44.390]  None of it went to sealing the border, by the way.
[01:15:45.069 --> 01:15:51.869]  Yes, there were some additional border agents, but most of the money went for attorneys for the illegals.
[01:15:52.149 --> 01:16:00.529]  Monies to the NGOs that are moving illegals and money for processing the two million people it would have let in the country.
[01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:07.149]  Yet she continues to insist that it's Trump who played politics with our immigration policy.
[01:16:07.329 --> 01:16:12.010]  She would take no responsibility for the illegals who entered the country.
[01:16:12.250 --> 01:16:25.000]  And when confronted with the list of young Americans, like Lake and Riley, who were murdered by illegals, she blames that on Donald Trump, as if he's been in charge over the last three years.
[01:16:26.079 --> 01:16:31.500]  Just totally, from every point of view, that was a train wreck.
[01:16:31.699 --> 01:16:33.479]  I didn't get to see it in real time.
[01:16:33.699 --> 01:16:34.880]  I watched it this morning.
[01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:41.100]  Owen Schroer texted me immediately afterwards and said, that was the worst interview I have ever seen.
[01:16:41.319 --> 01:16:45.359]  I have to conclude that he was absolutely right.
[01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:53.829]  This is a woman who's in desperate trouble politically, and she doesn't want to accept responsibility for anything.
[01:16:54.069 --> 01:16:59.369]  She pretends she's outside of government, that she's the change agent.
[01:16:59.510 --> 01:17:01.170]  She's going to bring a change.
[01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:06.199]  I frankly thought Brett Baier handled this pretty well.
[01:17:06.319 --> 01:17:15.399]  I mean, he was thought to be hostile because, of course, he famously called Arizona on election night for Joe Biden while people in Arizona were still voting.
[01:17:15.819 --> 01:17:20.079]  But I think, frankly, he did as good a job as you possibly can.
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:26.619]  She talked over him for most of the interview, and she avoided virtually every single question.
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:31.039]  Where I think she was worse is when it came to Iran.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:34.319]  The problems with Iran are Donald Trump's fault.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:52.060]  No, the problems with Iran came with the unfreezing of $190 billion in assets in which we gave them the money so they could restart their nuclear weapons development program and finance Hezbollah and Hamas.
[01:17:52.399 --> 01:17:58.180]  I had Colonel John Mills on my show yesterday who says, look, they already have a nuclear bomb.
[01:17:58.439 --> 01:17:59.600]  It may be primitive.
[01:17:59.779 --> 01:18:04.500]  It may not be that deliverable, but given their closeness to China, it's a pretty good bet.
[01:18:04.859 --> 01:18:11.119]  When you combine that with the money we have now given them, it's highly likely that they have a capability.
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:17.340]  Barack Obama, for some reason, thinks that that would provide for a more stable Middle East.
[01:18:17.539 --> 01:18:20.760]  No, I thought that was an absolute train yesterday, Alex.
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.180]  Well, it certainly is.
[01:18:24.239 --> 01:18:36.369]  I'm going to play some clips of that coming up in the next segment, but Let's hone in on all the talk about dictatorship, martial law, civil unrest, that they're predicting that we're going to trigger when clearly they're the ones getting it already.
[01:18:36.649 --> 01:18:40.789]  It looks very clear to me that they're planning something really nasty.
[01:18:40.949 --> 01:18:49.590]  I mean, they're saying, Biden says, Kamala says, violence after the election when the election isn't decided the first day.
[01:18:49.689 --> 01:18:50.850]  They're pre-programming that.
[01:18:50.909 --> 01:18:52.189]  Can you analyze that for a few minutes?
[01:18:52.579 --> 01:18:54.920]  Yeah, I think you're exactly right.
[01:18:55.619 --> 01:18:57.119]  We've seen this before.
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:10.750]  So, for example, when I said, look in a speech to the young Republicans in Jacksonville, look, if they lock us out of the counting centers like they did in Detroit and Philadelphia, You'll have to first go get a court order.
[01:19:10.890 --> 01:19:12.409]  That's a legal process.
[01:19:12.810 --> 01:19:18.810]  And then you may need a security guard to go back in to the polling places with your court order.
[01:19:19.229 --> 01:19:23.609]  Headline, Stone wants to place security guards at every polling place.
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.380]  Not even remotely what I said.
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:34.619]  So it's just typical of the kind of rhetoric where they again are saying, we're going to engage in violence.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.560]  No, we renounce violence.
[01:19:36.739 --> 01:19:38.199]  We have no violence planned.
[01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:46.439]  They are the ones who will use the machinery of government, the military, the police.
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:52.899]  It was the Detroit police who threw the Republican observers out of the counting centers in Detroit.
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:54.100]  In 2020.
[01:19:54.439 --> 01:19:54.899]  And let's go further.
[01:19:55.119 --> 01:20:01.140]  It was officially announced with the Democrats yesterday that they're going to put FBI at the polling places to make sure Trump people behave themselves.
[01:20:01.359 --> 01:20:05.220]  So they're already pre-scripting that Trump people are bad.
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:14.239]  And we've got lawsuits all over the country, Michigan, you name it, where the Democrats are not letting Republican observers again into the tabulation centers in total violation of state and federal law.

[01:21:21.649 --> 01:21:32.789]  Roger Stone went super viral with me a few days ago with his analysis on the executive order where they can clearly come in and claim foreign interference with no evidence and then not certify President Trump.
[01:21:32.989 --> 01:21:33.789]  And who would do that?
[01:21:33.909 --> 01:21:35.930]  It would be Kamala Harris over her own election.
[01:21:36.630 --> 01:21:38.010]  And there's more coming out on that.
[01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:40.930]  And Roger, the Brett Baird thing is amazing.
[01:21:41.210 --> 01:21:42.630]  She totally melted down.
[01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:44.390]  The left spun it as a victory.
[01:21:44.850 --> 01:21:46.970]  They do that in every case.
[01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:53.090]  They said Biden was a super genius when he couldn't even talk until suddenly he needed to be removed via the...
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:54.619]  25th Amendment.
[01:21:55.079 --> 01:21:56.420]  So she fell on her face.
[01:21:56.539 --> 01:21:57.220]  They're incredible clips.
[01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:58.000]  They're very entertaining.
[01:21:58.140 --> 01:21:58.880]  They're very disgusting.
[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:08.760]  When she's all over the place saying, I want to fund prisoners, including convicted murderers and rapists, having their penises cut off, and including breast implants in some prisons.
[01:22:08.859 --> 01:22:15.319]  They do up like $100,000 of crap on these insane lunatic men that they put in women's prisons where they rape and impregnate women.
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:19.880]  I mean, sure, it's a strong issue to show how crazy they are, how out of control they are.
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:37.359]  But compared to an executive order Biden updated and then directed against the American people for lethal force and troops on the streets and taking over society, while they say Trump's planning that, and while they say civil war conditions if Trump wins, and we've already had a coup,
[01:22:37.439 --> 01:22:49.380]  they already installed her and whoever's loading the teleprompter, obviously Obama and that whole clique, you're an expert on that branch of the deep state, and there's different factions obviously, so that's another question for you.
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:50.899]  That I want to ask.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:51.600]  You study them.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:52.279]  You know the names.
[01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:53.640]  You know who's actually calling the shots.
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:55.479]  I know as well.
[01:22:55.579 --> 01:23:01.199]  One reason we got targeted is you and I, you more than I, were telling Trump early on who was good, who was bad.
[01:23:01.319 --> 01:23:02.720]  We got a lot of them thrown out.
[01:23:02.859 --> 01:23:07.760]  Like Fiona Hill, they had 60 Minutes shows about you and I, how mean we were, lying about her.
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.439]  She doesn't even know George Soros.
[01:23:09.579 --> 01:23:11.239]  She doesn't know what globalism is.
[01:23:11.399 --> 01:23:16.739]  She was just on the board of his Open Society Foundation and the head of theglobalist.com.
[01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:19.850]  But yeah, Trump's a new guy.
[01:23:19.949 --> 01:23:20.770]  He's got the intel.
[01:23:20.909 --> 01:23:24.170]  He knows how to drain the swamp with the key people he puts in, but...
[01:23:25.159 --> 01:23:27.600]  They are literally pre-programming all this.
[01:23:27.659 --> 01:23:28.739]  We've already had a coup.
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.680]  And to me, that's the central issue.
[01:23:31.739 --> 01:23:33.140]  It's starting to get some traction.
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:41.500]  Also, the 325,000 missing kids she brought in and them stopping the DNA testing to cover the tracks, many of them in slave labor, many in sex slavery.
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:48.840]  That's another big issue I hope Trump goes all in on, not just mentioning the missing kids, but pledging to fine them and prosecute those that have been abusing them.
[01:23:49.279 --> 01:23:50.880]  That's a big, huge issue for him.
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:55.420]  The next level of the border and something that unifies everybody, And then calling her out.
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:56.520]  I know you talk to Trump all the time.
[01:23:56.819 --> 01:24:03.779]  Calling her out for being part of the administration, preparing the military to kill Americans, which we know the military doesn't want to do.
[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:05.659]  Trump's got to get on that.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:10.920]  And then, again, the fact that she was appointed, not elected as the nominee.
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:12.579]  I mean, those are the big enchiladas.
[01:24:12.939 --> 01:24:15.779]  Instead, they turn it around and claim what they're doing, Trump's doing.
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:22.979]  I mean, I'm not mad at Trump, but I don't understand why he's responding to stupid attacks and stuff and responding to a movie about...
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:28.060]  You know, you and him, which I haven't seen yet, you told me you saw it.
[01:24:28.159 --> 01:24:30.640]  I know you advised Trump not to watch it, but he's still talking about it.
[01:24:30.939 --> 01:24:32.220]  I mean, it's just crazy, Roger.
[01:24:32.399 --> 01:24:33.819]  It's just, look, I love Trump.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:34.859]  He's doing a great job.
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:35.800]  His energy is incredible.
[01:24:36.079 --> 01:24:38.579]  So I'm not a Monday morning quarterback.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:43.460]  I'm not a backseat driver, but holy Toledo, Roger, they're getting ready, obviously, for martial law.
[01:24:44.689 --> 01:24:47.250]  Alex, look, on some of that you're not wrong.
[01:24:47.449 --> 01:24:49.569]  On the other hand, the election's not tomorrow.
[01:24:49.810 --> 01:24:51.550]  So I really do think you're absolutely right.
[01:24:51.689 --> 01:25:01.039]  I think he needs to counter message this preparation for the violence that They have planned.
[01:25:01.199 --> 01:25:07.619]  He needs to be saying right now, no, they are the ones who are planning violence against the American people.
[01:25:07.779 --> 01:25:09.199]  I have no disagreement with that.
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:10.159]  It's very interesting.
[01:25:10.279 --> 01:25:16.420]  If you saw him at the Chicago Economic Club, he actually thought he was going there to give a speech.
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:24.569]  He didn't really realize he was going there for an inquisition, which really made his performance All the more impressive.
[01:25:24.869 --> 01:25:32.810]  I mean, he had an incredibly hostile and pompous moderator, a known never-Trumper.
[01:25:32.949 --> 01:25:36.069]  I think it was one of his best performances ever.
[01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:37.729]  So, yeah, I agree with you.
[01:25:37.829 --> 01:25:46.590]  I think the president needs to start identifying in advance what they have planned because they're being very, very clear about it.
[01:25:46.739 --> 01:25:55.460]  I don't think the strident nature of Kamala's rhetoric and her insistence on recycling the same lies.
[01:25:55.779 --> 01:26:00.439]  No, she said, I never said it shouldn't be a crime to come in the country legally.
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:01.399]  Of course she did.
[01:26:01.739 --> 01:26:03.840]  She said she didn't want to defund the police.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.819]  She did want to defund the police.
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:09.000]  So he's gotta continue to call her out on her lies.
[01:26:09.239 --> 01:26:14.020]  One that I just continue to find kind of almost amusing.
[01:26:14.399 --> 01:26:30.239]  Yes, the chief of staff who he canned for incompetence and for his constant efforts to dilute the president's agenda and his refusal to follow the orders of the commander in chief, he says Trump is unfit.
[01:26:30.529 --> 01:26:40.750]  His national security advisor, who used to go out and get drunk and say, I'm the only thing standing between us and World War III. I've got to stop Trump.
[01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:43.949]  Yeah, that guy says Trump is unfit.
[01:26:44.729 --> 01:27:04.260]  Mike Pence, the vice president, Who bought somebody else's legal analysis of the electoral college vote when it was, by every lawyer I've talked to that I respect, at a minimum an open question as to what his authority was when it came to the certification Of electors.
[01:27:04.399 --> 01:27:11.500]  And we had the president of John F. Kennedy in 1960, who filed alternative electors in Hawaii.
[01:27:11.779 --> 01:27:20.399]  Fortunately, he did, because when they finished counting all the votes, he actually had one, and those alternative electors became the electors.
[01:27:20.529 --> 01:27:23.689]  By the way, I hate to tell the people at the New Republic this.
[01:27:23.850 --> 01:27:26.050]  There is no such thing as a fake elector.
[01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:39.649]  That is a term made up by the talking heads at MSNBC. I'm not a lawyer, but even I can read the Electoral College Act allows for alternative electors, particularly when there's a pending lawsuit involved.
[01:27:39.949 --> 01:27:43.529]  They continue to say there was no fraud in the last election.
[01:27:43.949 --> 01:27:45.970]  62 legal cases denied it.
[01:27:46.069 --> 01:27:49.630]  No, 62 legal cases were never heard.
[01:27:50.279 --> 01:27:56.079]  They were all dismissed on the basis of standing or some other technical issue.
[01:27:56.399 --> 01:27:59.979]  So they continue to promulgate the same lies.
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:00.760]  Why?
[01:28:01.539 --> 01:28:07.560]  Polling's not good for them, Alex, despite the fact that I think most people don't realize that.
[01:28:07.699 --> 01:28:15.199]  Trump is being massively, massively outspent on media, particularly digital media.
[01:28:15.359 --> 01:28:16.779]  He's being outspent on cable.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.479]  He's being outspent on broadcast.
[01:28:18.899 --> 01:28:21.779]  He's really being outspent on digital media.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:23.779]  And it's not working.
[01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:29.029]  If it were working, then this race would not be moving directionally to Trump.
[01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:32.949]  And even the latest polls this morning continue to show that.
[01:28:34.970 --> 01:28:37.010]  Roger, I'm going to go back to the point I keep hammering.
[01:28:37.090 --> 01:28:38.449]  Everything you say is incredibly important.
[01:28:38.949 --> 01:28:43.189]  But they're like side dishes to the main steak on the table.
[01:28:44.189 --> 01:28:48.649]  The Democrats are like a tree full of parrots.
[01:28:49.870 --> 01:28:58.350]  Saying violence, civil unrest, martial law, civil war conditions, Kamala, Biden, all of them worried about violence, Trump's going to be violent, the FBI, memos.
[01:28:59.689 --> 01:29:02.470]  They are telegraphing their move in 18 days.
[01:29:03.550 --> 01:29:06.850]  And I, as I said again, this is an emergency, Roger.
[01:29:07.289 --> 01:29:10.930]  We're not seeing any response from the campaign to get ahead of this.
[01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:20.350]  They are framing Trump and his supporters, and God knows you and I are right on the top of the list, for something that'll make January 6th look like a cakewalk.
[01:29:20.869 --> 01:29:25.510]  So, I want to get back into that, and I want to get into the Fox interview that you've been talking about.
[01:29:26.670 --> 01:29:29.510]  Look, Alex, I don't disagree with you.
[01:29:29.630 --> 01:29:31.630]  Let's see what the campaign says tomorrow.
[01:29:31.810 --> 01:29:33.750]  Let's see what they say over the next couple days.
[01:29:34.449 --> 01:29:36.890]  Trump is certainly working hard.
[01:29:37.029 --> 01:29:40.850]  They would give me the impression that his health is bad.
[01:29:40.989 --> 01:29:42.250]  You keep saying he's in bad health.
[01:29:42.609 --> 01:29:44.329]  No, he's in excellent health.
[01:29:44.569 --> 01:29:48.630]  They keep saying that he's unfit, that he's unhinged.
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.439]  He's neither one of those things.
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:53.079]  Actually, I think he's in the best shape of his life.
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:54.619]  He's lost a little bit of weight.
[01:29:54.619 --> 01:29:56.399]  He's doing 10 interviews a day.
[01:29:56.539 --> 01:29:57.420]  The guy is a...
[01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:01.060]  I'm 50 and in pretty good shape, and I love to talk.
[01:30:01.239 --> 01:30:03.699]  I can't do 10 hours a day like him every day.
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:05.399]  The guy is a frickin' machine.
[01:30:06.109 --> 01:30:08.470]  No, his energy level is extraordinary.
[01:30:08.710 --> 01:30:11.510]  And by the way, when he called me, it was one o'clock in the morning.
[01:30:11.829 --> 01:30:13.810]  And we were both still working.
[01:30:13.970 --> 01:30:15.609]  Tells you something right there.
[01:30:15.909 --> 01:30:20.729]  So look, I think that he has hit his stride here on the campaign.
[01:30:20.949 --> 01:30:22.329]  He's not going to let up.
[01:30:22.489 --> 01:30:25.390]  I don't disagree with you in terms of the messaging.
[01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:32.130]  I do think he needs to begin to prepare people to understand that they are the ones planning violence.
[01:30:32.369 --> 01:30:41.869]  They are the ones who intend to use the government The military, the police, to shut down those who might ask a legitimate question.
[01:30:42.069 --> 01:30:50.850]  Here in Florida, it's a felony to ask an election board official the same question twice.
[01:30:51.109 --> 01:30:52.310]  That's absurd.
[01:30:52.630 --> 01:30:55.050]  But that's our new state law.
[01:30:57.239 --> 01:30:59.539]  Roger, let's start getting into some of these clips.
[01:31:00.140 --> 01:31:07.300]  Before we do that, I can tell people, unless they back out, I don't think they will, Trump reportedly is going to be in Austin next week to go on Joe Rogan.
[01:31:08.399 --> 01:31:16.039]  Rogan's policy is he's not going to interview just one of them, so the Trump interview is still hinging on her committing.
[01:31:17.439 --> 01:31:19.840]  And that would be the next week.
[01:31:20.819 --> 01:31:21.760]  And so...
[01:31:22.890 --> 01:31:36.970]  Talking about that, if she got pulled off the stage 25 minutes into the Brett Baer interview yesterday, it's on video, and then Baer talked about how, we'll play the clips in a moment, literally, they're all waving their arms, screaming, it's over, it's over, it's over.
[01:31:37.029 --> 01:31:39.109]  Like when they end those press conferences, you hear them screaming at the media.
[01:31:39.409 --> 01:31:40.810]  They were in panic mode.
[01:31:40.989 --> 01:31:47.310]  They sure didn't think she did a good job, though they spun it later that it was the greatest thing since Moses parted the Red Sea.
[01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.789]  And why?
[01:31:50.069 --> 01:31:57.210]  They've got to be really desperate if they're going to go on Rogan, because I hate to even say this on air, but all I do is tell the truth, so I give out inside baseball.
[01:31:57.409 --> 01:32:00.229]  They're nuts if she goes on there.
[01:32:01.170 --> 01:32:05.729]  He's going to let her talk, and she's going to make a complete fool out of herself.
[01:32:07.050 --> 01:32:14.350]  Well, look, it's no surprise to you, Alex, that I'm not the biggest Rogan fan, but I will say this.
[01:32:14.890 --> 01:32:19.689]  Joe Rogan's not going to let himself be treated the way Bret Baier was just treated on Fox.
[01:32:19.810 --> 01:32:21.569]  Not a chance in the world.
[01:32:21.710 --> 01:32:23.090]  Not a chance in the world.
[01:32:23.489 --> 01:32:25.270]  And she doesn't want to answer questions.
[01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:32.010]  She wants to talk over the host and keep spewing this constant, hey, this Trump is dividing us.
[01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:32.729]  Trump is dividing us.
[01:32:32.729 --> 01:32:34.930]  Oh, I would love to see her do that with Rogan.
[01:32:35.699 --> 01:32:37.039]  I'd like to see her try it.
[01:32:37.079 --> 01:32:39.840]  It would be very entertaining, very entertaining.
[01:32:40.739 --> 01:32:45.979]  Look, I just watched a terrific interview with President Trump with Patrick David.
[01:32:46.319 --> 01:32:47.260]  You're absolutely right.
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:33:00.289]  He totally understands And you knew this probably earlier than most, the value of alternative media, the value of these major influencer podcasts.
[01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:02.449]  He's now working it very hard.
[01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:07.609]  His son, Barron, I think has been a major catalyst for that.
[01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:15.989]  I think Barron is really the one who enlightened his father about the millions of people that you can reach through this alternative media.
[01:33:16.789 --> 01:33:18.710]  Yeah, a billion on Musk?
[01:33:18.909 --> 01:33:19.829]  I mean, come on.
[01:33:19.949 --> 01:33:24.130]  And look, in 1920, cars were the alternative to horses.
[01:33:24.649 --> 01:33:27.829]  By 1930, horses were the alternative to cars.
[01:33:28.069 --> 01:33:32.369]  By 1950, horses were basically not used anymore for transportation.
[01:33:32.829 --> 01:33:36.270]  So it's not just that the alternative media is the alternative.
[01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:38.850]  We're now the car in 1950.
[01:33:39.529 --> 01:33:41.390]  CNN is now the horse.
[01:33:41.630 --> 01:33:42.369]  It's over.
[01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:43.130]  They're done.
[01:33:44.489 --> 01:33:45.770]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:33:46.010 --> 01:33:49.510]  So what's happening here is cable is going the way of network television.
[01:33:50.050 --> 01:33:52.189]  Network television is an anachronism.
[01:33:52.329 --> 01:33:53.369]  They're not making any money.
[01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:54.369]  Nobody's watching.
[01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:57.029]  They really have no point.
[01:33:57.149 --> 01:33:58.050]  Poor Leslie Stahl.
[01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.989]  Nobody's watching.
[01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:02.069]  And thus it is with cable.
[01:34:02.270 --> 01:34:07.810]  So Trump, I think, has been very wise to pursue this podcast strategy.
[01:34:07.970 --> 01:34:08.409]  And you're right.
[01:34:08.989 --> 01:34:10.529]  They're not easy, by the way.
[01:34:10.670 --> 01:34:12.149]  I mean, you've got to be on your toes.
[01:34:13.109 --> 01:34:14.470]  And they want you there in person.
[01:34:14.609 --> 01:34:15.250]  So let me ask you this.
[01:34:15.329 --> 01:34:16.310]  I'll go back to what I said again.
[01:34:16.949 --> 01:34:18.170]  And I know you're dialed in.
[01:34:18.250 --> 01:34:19.489]  We even talked privately about this.
[01:34:19.649 --> 01:34:27.850]  But, Roger, they are 100% preparing to try to steal it or not certified, as you said, it went viral days ago, as it's true in the executive order.
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:30.300]  They know they're going to lose.
[01:34:30.439 --> 01:34:36.000]  So I get with 18 days, you're in campaign mode to make sure his win's so big it overcomes the fraud.
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:36.659]  Too big to rig.
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:37.600]  I get your strategy.
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:38.439]  It's the winning strategy.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:49.300]  But separately, they better move from 100% campaigning to, say, 80% campaigning, 20% preparing for the fight that comes.
[01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:52.039]  The day after November 5th.
[01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:53.460]  I mean, my goodness gracious.
[01:34:53.939 --> 01:35:02.520]  And as we approach the election, the day of the election, he better shift gears completely into the deep state because they're not going away easy, brother.
[01:35:04.079 --> 01:35:16.739]  Well, combine that, Alex, and I got your message, but combine that, Alex, with the fact that the president, as you pointed out, has now asked for additional security measures and technology to protect him.
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:23.260]  He clearly understands that the alternative to stealing the election is trying to kill him.
[01:35:24.439 --> 01:35:30.430]  Yeah, every time he gets up in Trump Force One, That's the obvious move.
[01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:32.189]  Deep State takes him out with a surface air missile.
[01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:36.510]  And his request for the missile defense systems that, again, aren't on the ground, folks.
[01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:37.350]  They're in the planes.
[01:35:37.689 --> 01:35:40.829]  A C-130 with it behind him will stop the missiles.
[01:35:41.210 --> 01:35:42.750]  And is that going to happen, Roger?
[01:35:44.409 --> 01:35:45.489]  Excellent question.
[01:35:45.689 --> 01:35:49.069]  I can't see the Biden administration doing that for him.
[01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:57.369]  They haven't even given him, in truth, they lie about this, they haven't even given him the additional Secret Service protection that he's asked for.
[01:35:57.590 --> 01:36:00.649]  So I think he grasps this now.
[01:36:00.789 --> 01:36:06.189]  I think he understands that if they can't beat him at the polling box, they might want to put him in a box.
[01:36:06.569 --> 01:36:19.930]  And we still have no answers about the last I'm pointing out this guy Ryan Routh, they have now postponed his trial indefinitely.
[01:36:20.409 --> 01:36:25.329]  They say there's so much evidence now that we can't possibly get through all of it.
[01:36:25.489 --> 01:36:29.829]  It'll take us eternity evidently because he's never gonna go to trial.
[01:36:30.329 --> 01:36:39.970]  And then they take this poor guy, Vem Miller, who was not posing any threat to Trump, who's a Trump supporter who did nothing wrong.
[01:36:40.189 --> 01:36:41.050]  You had him on.
[01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.890]  I had him on.
[01:36:42.050 --> 01:36:43.310]  They smear this guy.
[01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:44.390]  They say all kinds.
[01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:46.470]  He had fake passports.
[01:36:46.630 --> 01:36:47.250]  No, he didn't.
[01:36:47.529 --> 01:36:49.989]  He had a fraudulent pass to the Trump rally.
[01:36:50.210 --> 01:36:51.130]  No, he didn't.
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:54.140]  So they use anything they can to create fear.
[01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:58.699]  So Roger, let's start getting to the Brett Baer clips here, because you're right, they're important.
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:04.640]  Let's go ahead and play four and five back-to-back, showing how rigged this was and how they hit the panic button and put the hook in.
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:05.039]  Here it is.
[01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:08.409]  I hope you got to say what you wanted to say about Donald Trump.
[01:37:08.949 --> 01:37:16.989]  There are a lot of things that people want to learn about you and your policies and that's why we invited you here.
[01:37:16.989 --> 01:37:30.369]  I invite everyone to go to KamalaHarris.com and you will see that I have 80 Pages of policies that are quite comprehensive and should be accessible to anyone who would like to read them.
[01:37:30.630 --> 01:37:37.789]  And it includes what I intend to do about affordable housing, what I intend to do about small businesses, what I intend to do to strengthen our economy.
[01:37:37.789 --> 01:37:40.430]  And that's why we invited you here, to see where you were in 2019 and where you are now.
[01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:45.689]  To support America's military and ensure we have the most lethal and best fighting force in the world.
[01:37:45.930 --> 01:37:48.189]  Madam Vice President, they're giving me a hard wrap here.
[01:37:48.189 --> 01:37:49.289]  Well, I thank you for the time.
[01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:50.229]  I thank you for the time.
[01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:50.850]  It's good to meet you.
[01:37:50.869 --> 01:37:51.510]  Thank you very much.
[01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.850]  Thank you.
[01:37:52.479 --> 01:37:54.039]  Dana, you've been on the other side.
[01:37:54.319 --> 01:37:59.600]  You've been on the rapper as a press secretary interviewing a president.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.699]  And, you know, I'm talking like four people waving their hands like it's got to stop.
[01:38:05.319 --> 01:38:06.600]  So, Martha, final.
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:10.000]  Yeah, I had to dismount there at the end.
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:13.380]  There's so many things and she maybe should do more of these.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:16.100]  Madam Vice President, they're giving me a hard wrap.
[01:38:16.239 --> 01:38:17.180]  Well, I thank you for the time.
[01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:18.140]  I thank you for the time.
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:18.760]  It's good to meet you.
[01:38:18.859 --> 01:38:19.920]  So, Roger.
[01:38:22.130 --> 01:38:26.369]  The system's got to know that they've got a problem with her and that she's super unpopular.
[01:38:26.850 --> 01:38:35.529]  You've been saying that they would love to have Biden step down to use the gimmick of her being the first female president just days before the election.
[01:38:35.829 --> 01:38:45.590]  And we saw a video that will B-roll here while you talk at an event where Obama is clearly, clearly chewing out Trump.
[01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:52.949]  Biden is mad at him, and Biden grabs by the arm, and it looks very, very submissive.
[01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:57.949]  All is not well in the swamp right now.
[01:38:59.149 --> 01:39:05.350]  No, I think Joe Biden himself, in his lucid moments, still continues to be very bitter about being pushed aside.
[01:39:05.909 --> 01:39:21.949]  Now, he did launch a particularly nasty attack on Donald Trump, calling him a criminal, which is pretty funny for a guy who took bribes from China and whose son took bribes from China, Russia, Romania,
[01:39:22.909 --> 01:39:23.569]  Ukraine.
[01:39:23.569 --> 01:39:25.550]  We could keep going on and on.
[01:39:25.930 --> 01:39:30.069]  But yeah, I think that they are unhappy with their choice now.
[01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:34.210]  I don't think Barack Obama ever wanted her to be the nominee.
[01:39:34.489 --> 01:39:41.470]  I think he took her only grudgingly because he couldn't convince their strongest candidate, Michelle Obama, to run.
[01:39:41.829 --> 01:39:54.489]  But that explains the 10-day interregnum between the time that Joe got out and the Clintons endorsed Kamala Harris, but Barack Obama and Michelle Obama did not do so.
[01:39:54.829 --> 01:39:58.170]  It's too late to swap her out.
[01:39:58.329 --> 01:39:59.750]  That's not going to happen.
[01:39:59.970 --> 01:40:02.810]  It's too late to swap Tim Walz out.
[01:40:02.949 --> 01:40:05.869]  That guy Is an unmitigated disaster.
[01:40:05.970 --> 01:40:08.329]  You have to wonder about the vetting on him.
[01:40:08.529 --> 01:40:09.569]  There is no question.
[01:40:09.810 --> 01:40:12.069]  He lied about his military service.
[01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:13.810]  He lied about his rank.
[01:40:13.949 --> 01:40:15.729]  He lied about being in combat.
[01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:21.050]  He's got ties to Russia that are deeply troubling.
[01:40:21.439 --> 01:40:28.960]  He has been involved in an immigration scandal in his own state.
[01:40:29.159 --> 01:40:35.460]  They could not possibly have selected him if they knew about any of these things in advance.
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:37.680]  Remember, he was the default candidate.
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:50.159]  The Democrats were poised to nominate Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania until Barack Obama vetoed that, saying it would cost them Michigan and Minnesota.
[01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:51.880]  And now there's a lot of smoke coming out.
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:41:03.619]  I think?
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:22.640]  What do we do if they refuse to certify Trump, if Kamala, the person he's running against, who would be in that position as vice president, refuses to certify him and certifies herself?
[01:41:22.859 --> 01:41:24.460]  What do we do in that constitutional crisis?
[01:41:25.170 --> 01:41:26.949]  I can't answer the question.
[01:41:27.550 --> 01:41:35.369]  Because first of all, anything we will say, they'll say, oh, Jones and Stone, there they were advocating violent revolution, violent overthrow of the government.
[01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:39.069]  So I'm not walking into the trap because that's not what I'm for.
[01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:42.810]  This is a question, unfortunately, for the lawyers.
[01:41:43.529 --> 01:41:46.189]  I don't know what your redress is.
[01:41:46.270 --> 01:41:48.930]  I was about to say the Supreme Court has to step in and override it.
[01:41:49.710 --> 01:41:52.390]  I would think that that would be the case.
[01:41:53.489 --> 01:41:59.649]  It's so broad and so general, but you see them laying the groundwork for it constantly.
[01:42:00.710 --> 01:42:01.109]  That's right.
[01:42:01.130 --> 01:42:06.750]  When you responded to their open coup against Trump saying they won't certify, the headlines were Roger Stone planning a coup.
[01:42:07.010 --> 01:42:08.430]  They have replaced Biden.
[01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:09.310]  They've installed her.
[01:42:09.390 --> 01:42:10.289]  It's an admitted coup.
[01:42:10.710 --> 01:42:12.050]  Even 60 Minutes admits that.
[01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:13.149]  PBS admits that.
[01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:14.189]  They're just normalizing it.
[01:42:14.289 --> 01:42:17.989]  And then you say, yeah, they're doing a coup, and then you're pushing a coup.
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:25.460]  Yeah, because what I really said was there's a million non-existent voters on the voting rolls in the swing states.
[01:42:26.239 --> 01:42:36.060]  And I had a guest on the show, Chris Jersky, who talked about the completely legal process of identifying and getting those people removed from the rolls.
[01:42:36.359 --> 01:42:42.180]  I never said that legitimate voters who are on the roll should be disenfranchised.
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:43.960]  That's Not what I said.
[01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:45.699]  No, we're taking the illegal aliens off of it.
[01:42:45.779 --> 01:42:48.020]  StoneZone.com, another powerful interview.
[01:42:48.159 --> 01:42:48.840]  Thank you, Roger Stone.
[01:42:49.539 --> 01:42:51.159]  Great to be with you, Alex, as always.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:52.199]  Thank you, sir.
[01:42:52.779 --> 01:42:57.520]  All right, I'm going to cover all the news, the mass censorship, the globalists, the military news.
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:01.920]  They're saying mainstream news, they're going to give nuclear weapons to Ukraine.
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:06.060]  You cannot make up the magnitude of that insanity.
[01:43:06.979 --> 01:43:09.060]  That's Bild, German newspaper reporting that.
[01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:12.539]  But I plugged for 30 seconds in the first hour.
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:14.199]  We're not going to be able to operate at that level.
[01:43:14.319 --> 01:43:16.239]  I need your support, plus we've got great products.

[01:44:36.859 --> 01:44:42.079]  There's also the Fentanyl, the Dragon Limited Edition, and Special Edition Halloween shirts.
[01:44:42.199 --> 01:44:57.699]  It's all there at thealexjonesstore.com, and there's also Optimal Human, the most powerful superfood green drink, even better than AG Greens, which is excellent, by the way, and 40% less than they sell it for, and just as much product at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:44:57.859 --> 01:44:58.840]  So get great products.
[01:44:59.100 --> 01:44:59.960]  Keep us on the air.
[01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:15.420]  Whatever happens to InfoWars, whatever they do trying to say I can't use my name or, you know, can't use whatever, We're working with folks that are setting up the Alex Jones Network on X. Follow us there at AJNLive.
[01:45:15.779 --> 01:45:19.300]  That's key to follow us there and so much more.
[01:45:19.899 --> 01:45:21.260]  Yep, worried about them taking that away?
[01:45:21.439 --> 01:45:23.880]  Well, we'll just keep fighting at AJNLive.
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:25.260]  AJNLive.
[01:45:25.539 --> 01:45:29.100]  And I'm doing another live show tonight at AJNLive.
[01:45:29.359 --> 01:45:31.659]  We're going to do that tonight at AJNLive.
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:43.560]  The deep state hates me almost more than anybody in the world except President Trump.
[01:45:43.739 --> 01:45:45.479]  That's because I've got their number.
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:55.159]  We've got a giant audience of activists like you that understand what's happening as well and aren't going to roll over and let them take over our planet and enslave us and depopulate us.
[01:45:55.180 --> 01:45:56.600]  We're going to stop this death cult together.
[01:45:57.079 --> 01:46:00.439]  But the enemies of freedom are trying to shut us down November 13th.
[01:46:00.659 --> 01:46:05.119]  Regardless, our great sponsors are going to keep the broadcast going no matter what.
[01:46:05.239 --> 01:46:06.539]  But we need funds to do it.
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:11.960]  So please go to our amazing sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com and get some of these amazing designs.
[01:46:12.250 --> 01:46:14.289]  More than 15 years ago, I designed this baby.
[01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:15.130]  We've brought it back.
[01:46:15.310 --> 01:46:15.970]  I love it.
[01:46:16.130 --> 01:46:16.909]  It's a collectible.
[01:46:17.050 --> 01:46:17.949]  It's limited edition.
[01:46:18.210 --> 01:46:19.770]  It's at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:46:19.949 --> 01:46:27.449]  And now, they've added long-sleeved, lightweight, and heavyweight hoodies for cool weather and super cold weather with all these incredible designs.
[01:46:27.569 --> 01:46:29.630]  They're now available at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:46:29.729 --> 01:46:30.829]  And it gets even crazier.
[01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:34.220]  These shirts are being made right now, so I don't have one, but tomorrow we'll have one.
[01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:35.300]  It's in the mail to us right now.
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:36.279]  Look at this.
[01:46:36.359 --> 01:46:37.220]  You talk about fun.
[01:46:37.859 --> 01:46:42.359]  I was going to be a Democrat for Halloween, but my head wouldn't fit up my ass.
[01:46:42.739 --> 01:46:43.619]  Gotta love that.
[01:46:43.939 --> 01:46:44.579]  Here's another one.
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:47.159]  Make Halloween Great Again with the evil Trump.
[01:46:47.399 --> 01:46:49.039]  Make the frogs straight again.
[01:46:49.439 --> 01:46:53.560]  All these great designs and more are available at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:54.859]  It keeps us on the air.
[01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:58.380]  It's critical time in the face of the globalists, and they're amazing shirts.
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:01.699]  You'll meet so many great people when you're out wearing these.
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:04.539]  It's an adventure to wear these shirts, and it keeps us on air.
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:06.199]  Thank you for standing with us.
[01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:07.659]  Thank you for supporting Free Speech.
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:09.159]  You are the reason we're still here.
[01:47:09.439 --> 01:47:10.000]  God bless you.
[01:47:10.079 --> 01:47:12.100]  Now, please visit thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:47:12.359 --> 01:47:14.579]  And again, I want to thank all those that have gone and gotten the shirts.
[01:47:14.859 --> 01:47:16.000]  Thank you so much for what you're doing.
[01:47:16.199 --> 01:47:16.899]  You are amazing.
[01:47:23.039 --> 01:47:26.399]  We interrupt our program to bring you this important message.
[01:47:26.739 --> 01:47:29.079]  All other networks lie to you about what's happening now.
[01:47:29.779 --> 01:47:32.359]  InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:47:32.899 --> 01:47:36.579]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:40.079]  Alright, here's what I'm going to do.
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:42.560]  I must cover all this news.
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:44.560]  I'm going to laser focus...
[01:47:46.409 --> 01:47:54.930]  Like a robot, give you my analysis on all this critical intel for 20 minutes when we start the next segment and 300 plus stations join us.
[01:47:55.970 --> 01:48:03.909]  And then I'm opening the phones up specifically because I'm trying to get everybody focused on the Democrats openly preparing civil war and martial law.
[01:48:04.510 --> 01:48:07.430]  And Roger said, I got your message because I know he talks to Trump every day.
[01:48:08.890 --> 01:48:15.810]  And behind the scenes I twist Roger's arm and he's told Trump all this stuff.
[01:48:17.710 --> 01:48:18.970]  But everybody needs to do it.
[01:48:19.550 --> 01:48:24.189]  And I can call the campaign head and other people, but the best way to do it is just on air and get all of you to do it too.
[01:48:24.850 --> 01:48:27.649]  He needs to be exposing what they're planning to try to steal it again.
[01:48:27.729 --> 01:48:28.689]  He's got to get ahead of this.
[01:48:29.369 --> 01:48:30.310]  Don't say that, sir.
[01:48:30.409 --> 01:48:33.050]  It looks like, you know, you're planning to steal it or you're not confident.
[01:48:33.550 --> 01:48:35.470]  My God, they're totally gearing up.
[01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:36.609]  You've got to expose it.
[01:48:37.689 --> 01:48:51.319]  Now, coming up, the news I'm going to cover is Bill, that's a very credible, the top publication in Germany, has come out and said Ukraine is going to get nuclear weapons.
[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:53.640]  So this is a major beyond escalation.
[01:48:53.979 --> 01:49:00.279]  I'm going to hit that and break down what's really behind that and get into the censorship of the EU that affects us here big time.
[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:02.220]  They're coming after Musk and you and I and everybody.
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:03.380]  This is huge.
[01:49:04.199 --> 01:49:07.859]  It's an example of globalist tyranny and more and your calls.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.079]  I'll give the number out when we come back.
[01:49:09.539 --> 01:49:10.699]  But first, this important report.
[01:49:11.130 --> 01:49:22.250]  Here's your chance to keep my broadcast, which the globalists absolutely hate, which is devastating them, on the air and empower your body, your overall health, your immune system, your mental clarity.
[01:49:22.630 --> 01:49:33.949]  Now, anybody that knows about supplements and what is the most popular stuff out there knows that Irish sea moss has compounds in it that make it arguably the greatest superfood out there.
[01:49:34.109 --> 01:49:38.050]  It's got one of the best bioavailable forms of iodine in it.
[01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:50.880]  It's got all these key minerals, all of these key vitamins, and a bunch of other what they call ring structures involved in it that help the vitamins and minerals and other compounds like iodine get directly into your cells.
[01:49:51.079 --> 01:50:06.680]  So you want to go to thealexjonesstore.com and get this incredible ring We're good to go.
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:08.659]  We're good to go.
[01:50:11.590 --> 01:50:18.390]  And there's also amazing t-shirts, hoodies, and ball caps that have the message of liberty, Infowars, Alex Jones, President Trump.
[01:50:18.689 --> 01:50:27.090]  All of these messages support and promote freedom and exercise your First Amendment in the face of the leftist tyrants that want to silence all of us.
[01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:36.510]  So, it is a 360 win to keep my broadcast on the air, one way or another, when you go to the alexjogestore.com and get Ultimate CMOS and some of the other products that are there.
[01:50:36.670 --> 01:50:38.689]  I can't do this without your help.
[01:50:38.869 --> 01:50:43.489]  I try to bring you products that I know are really going to work so you'll love them, so you'll come back and get them again and again.
[01:50:43.630 --> 01:50:44.689]  I will never give up.
[01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:45.670]  I will never sell out.
[01:50:45.729 --> 01:50:46.510]  I will never back down.
[01:50:46.609 --> 01:50:48.250]  But we could give out without your support.
[01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:55.210]  Look, the globalists with all their big fake lawsuits and rig courts openly told me, stop promoting the Second Amendment, stop promoting Trump, we'll drop all this.
[01:50:55.460 --> 01:51:00.119]  They literally think that I will buckle to them, that I will bow to them, that I will give in to them.
[01:51:00.199 --> 01:51:01.840]  I will never do that.
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.119]  I will never sell out.
[01:51:03.199 --> 01:51:03.680]  It's impossible.
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:04.500]  Can't even think about it.
[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:10.039]  But I could give out, as I keep saying, so please keep us on the air.
[01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:11.939]  We have broken so many huge stories.
[01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:18.359]  We've exposed the poison shots, the open borders, the globalist pedophile rings, the World War III situation.
[01:51:18.779 --> 01:51:23.140]  Almost everybody I interview that's prominently fighting the New World Order now says I woke them up.
[01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:24.399]  People like Tucker Carlson.
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:27.180]  Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:32.000]  So the show has been a devastating weapon against the New World Order.
[01:51:32.449 --> 01:51:37.090]  But it cannot continue on, no matter what happens to Infowars here in the next few weeks, without your support.
[01:51:37.229 --> 01:51:54.010]  So please make the decision now to keep me on air and to keep the crew working and to keep the special reports coming out by going to thealexjonesstore.com and getting the ultimate CMOS, getting t-shirts, hoodies, ball caps, new designs being added, limited edition, super high quality at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:51:54.350 --> 01:52:02.329]  Again, I humbly thank you for all your support and I ask you to please keep me in the game, make the decision now to go to thealexjonesstore.com and God bless you all.
[01:52:02.439 --> 01:52:16.939]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's go to the news and take your phone calls in this hour.
[01:52:17.119 --> 01:52:20.039]  I'll host a little bit in the next hour when Andrew Hernandez takes over out of Owen Schroer at 3 p.m.
[01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:24.000]  Central with the amazing, informative, dynamic War Room.
[01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:43.020]  And we are 26 days out from the Democrats trying to shut down Infowars, and they filed in federal court through the Justice Department to take my name and real Alex Jones on X. They say they own the name Alex Jones Show, and they own everything in violation of the 13th Amendment.
[01:52:43.779 --> 01:52:46.739]  We'll be getting to the bigger attack.
[01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:53.279]  Notice I'm spending a little bit of time on myself today, even though it's a big story, it affects us all, because the attack on Elon Musk is bigger.
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:13.880]  We're good to go.
[01:53:14.229 --> 01:53:17.710]  They were the first in Germany to report on the U.S. government blowing up the Nord Stream pipeline.
[01:53:17.909 --> 01:53:22.430]  So they are very credible, not as good as Shai Hirsch, who I'd give a 99.
[01:53:22.630 --> 01:53:23.949]  I'd give Bill about a 90.
[01:53:24.710 --> 01:53:28.430]  But for legacy media, you know, they're usually right.
[01:53:28.850 --> 01:53:31.130]  And of course, I don't just go off what they say.
[01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:33.590]  I know the background and how this works in escalation.
[01:53:35.569 --> 01:53:51.430]  Biden, over a month ago, almost five weeks ago, meets with Keir Starmer, and the Brits had already announced, yeah, we're going to give jointly U.S.-British-made Storm Shadow heavy cruise missiles directed and launched by the West into Russia.
[01:53:52.189 --> 01:53:59.289]  Now, you've already had the Ukrainians blowing up bridges and sending drones and attacking Moscow and big incursions 100 miles in, and the war is just completely out of control.
[01:54:00.149 --> 01:54:03.409]  And the Russians have won their aims.
[01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:15.460]  And so NATO is escalating and sitting in heavier and heavier weapons and attacking nuclear reactors and blaming the Russians and being caught doing it.
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:20.220]  And it's just totally dangerous and escalatory and insane.
[01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:31.659]  But that's because the old globalist empire is dying and is trying to hold World War III gun, not just new bioweapon releases, to our head and everybody's brain.
[01:54:33.769 --> 01:54:49.210]  So, BUILD is reporting, you can read the article, and of course they've leaked this on purpose out of NATO, that NATO officials, high level, have told BUILD, so they want the Russians to know,
[01:54:49.670 --> 01:54:59.890]  that Ukraine has nuclear reactors, Ukraine has scientists, and Ukraine is weeks away from having atomic bombs.
[01:55:01.279 --> 01:55:06.359]  And Ukraine might use atomic bombs on Russia.
[01:55:08.279 --> 01:55:10.239]  Boy, that's quite a headline.
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:12.500]  Because that's really what it should read.
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:17.140]  Not German news publication claims Ukraine could have nuclear weapons within weeks.
[01:55:18.239 --> 01:55:23.399]  Germany's most respected news publication reports, according to high-level NATO officials.
[01:55:25.539 --> 01:55:27.140]  The headline is...
[01:55:28.010 --> 01:55:39.689]  Globalists threaten Russia with nuclear-armed Ukraine in greatest nuclear war escalation in human history.
[01:55:40.050 --> 01:56:01.000]  Or you'd have another headline that actually approaches the dire existential ultra-urgent Armageddon-flirting nuclear conflagration-pushing It's satanic behavior.
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:04.479]  I mean, words don't even approach it.
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:05.579]  It's just...
[01:56:05.579 --> 01:56:08.520]  So...
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:12.500]  First, we're going to rain missiles down on you.
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:13.720]  Roger's like, we'll go to nuclear war.
[01:56:13.939 --> 01:56:16.100]  And they're just like, well, we're not going to start the nuclear war.
[01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:18.000]  But Ukraine might...
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.880]  That way they have plausible historical deniability.
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:22.279]  Wow!
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:23.979]  So I was saying last...
[01:56:24.779 --> 01:56:38.239]  Three weeks, since five weeks ago, when they escalated right up to the verge, Russia said, fine, we'll start attacking NATO targets if you get us with any conventional weapons inside Russia, any conventional heavy weapons, and target our military bases.
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:50.340]  And I saw them starting, oh, maybe we'll make a deal, and Zelensky came over with Trump, and I saw a lot of signs that maybe they were coming up for air, leveling up towards sanity.
[01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:52.020]  No, no.
[01:56:52.969 --> 01:56:53.609]  No.
[01:56:54.289 --> 01:56:54.890]  No.
[01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:58.569]  I didn't say they were becoming sane.
[01:56:58.569 --> 01:57:02.430]  I said I was seeing some signs of it, and that I was hopeful.
[01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:05.510]  Well, this is not hopeful.
[01:57:05.710 --> 01:57:22.590]  This is a direct threat through a credible publication by NATO to Russia that, okay, we'll just give our surrogate proxy military in this hybrid war that's turned into a full regional war, threatening total war,
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:33.760]  Nuclear weapons, and then when it comes out that NATO blew up the Nord Stream, they'll fall back to, oh, actually, Ukraine, five guys on a sailboat did it.
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:38.319]  Oh, we didn't detonate a nuclear weapon in the middle of Russian forces.
[01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:42.180]  No, the Ukrainians did, so what are you going to do now?
[01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:52.000]  The denial, just like weather weapons, they don't want to admit they've got them, which they earlier did, because then they get in trouble.
[01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:53.260]  Oh, it's not us.
[01:57:54.810 --> 01:57:57.529]  Oh, it's not us letting in the fentanyl, killing hundreds of thousands a year.
[01:57:57.750 --> 01:58:04.789]  Oh, it's not BlackRock funding the schools to put pro-pedophile books in all the public schools.
[01:58:05.069 --> 01:58:05.689]  No, no, no.
[01:58:05.689 --> 01:58:06.989]  It's all plausible deniability.
[01:58:07.149 --> 01:58:09.409]  Oh, it's Soros funding open borders, not the State Department.
[01:58:11.369 --> 01:58:21.170]  And so the headline is, NATO threatens Russia with Ukraine as the nuclear war trigger.
[01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:26.770]  Like China uses North Korea as the plausible deniability mechanism.
[01:58:29.729 --> 01:58:30.390]  Wow.
[01:58:32.029 --> 01:58:35.789]  Yeah, the build headline is Ukraine to have the atom bomb.
[01:58:40.810 --> 01:58:43.829]  Speaking of Donald Trump, I told him, what is the way out of this?
[01:58:44.109 --> 01:58:49.770]  Either Ukraine will have nuclear weapons, and they will serve as protection, or we need to be in some kind of alliance.
[01:58:49.770 --> 01:58:54.449]  We don't know any effective alliances except NATO, Zelensky said to Trump.
[01:58:55.470 --> 01:59:04.770]  And now, they've had NATO tell, build, okay, well, we'll just wink, wink, hey kid, here's a nuclear weapon.
[01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:10.430]  Like handing a machine gun to a chimpanzee that you've given methamphetamines to.
[01:59:13.649 --> 01:59:14.890]  Kind of a big deal.
[01:59:15.909 --> 01:59:17.630]  What do callers think about that?
[01:59:17.770 --> 01:59:19.970]  And what do you think about the domestic escalation?
[01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:23.890]  Civil war conditions, martial law, troops on the streets to kill Americans.
[01:59:24.090 --> 01:59:26.550]  The troops are coming to kill you, Kamala Harris says.
[01:59:28.930 --> 01:59:35.149]  And then they have an executive order and have the Pentagon put a report for full martial law and killing citizens.
[01:59:35.350 --> 01:59:40.369]  And everybody that finally focused on it focuses on the Pentagon saying we'll kill citizens with lethal force.
[01:59:42.010 --> 01:59:42.489]  Lethality.
[01:59:44.699 --> 01:59:46.979]  We're not for global government, we're for global governance.
[01:59:47.359 --> 01:59:48.720]  Same thing, but different word.
[01:59:49.439 --> 01:59:55.380]  So, this is a big deal.
[01:59:56.020 --> 02:00:01.779]  And that's just what I keep telling people is, you study history, geopolitics and stuff, none of this has ever been done.
[02:00:01.899 --> 02:00:07.619]  This is all uncharted, cuckoo for cocoa puffs, crazy town.
[02:00:11.310 --> 02:00:12.789]  Alright, the toll-free number to join us.
[02:00:12.850 --> 02:00:14.470]  I'm just going to take eight calls after the break.
[02:00:14.770 --> 02:00:16.189]  Still got 15 minutes more news to cover.
[02:00:17.409 --> 02:00:21.069]  But I want to hear from you just on the massive escalations and what do we do to get ahead of it?
[02:00:21.130 --> 02:00:25.229]  Well, obviously we get Elon Musk and Trump to talk about it.
[02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:27.989]  But if they're not going to do it, we're going to do it.
[02:00:28.329 --> 02:00:29.930]  And yeah, okay, I'm reaching...
[02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:33.159]  20 million people today, maybe?
[02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:35.199]  If we're lucky, probably 10, 15.
[02:00:35.399 --> 02:00:36.000]  Okay, that's great.
[02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:38.399]  What if you all get upset about this?
[02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:40.000]  What if you take the clips of the show?
[02:00:40.199 --> 02:00:45.000]  What if once we archive this in a few hours to X and band out video, what if you go get it and share it?
[02:00:45.060 --> 02:00:49.260]  Because that's why the deep state wants us off air, because we're having very sane, real discussions here.
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:55.779]  And they know not just the general public, but policymakers around the world tune into this show or see clips and go, God, that guy knows what he's talking about.
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:56.359]  How does he know that?
[02:00:56.579 --> 02:00:57.439]  Well, that's what I do.
[02:00:58.909 --> 02:01:01.989]  I knew more when I was 15 years old than the average general.
[02:01:02.170 --> 02:01:06.430]  Because they just compartmentalize, go play golf, and fill out paperwork and act like they know what they're talking about.
[02:01:06.590 --> 02:01:07.529]  They're not interested in it.
[02:01:07.609 --> 02:01:08.390]  They don't care about it.
[02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:09.310]  I do care about it.
[02:01:11.289 --> 02:01:13.529]  I've read probably 50 books put out by the Rand Corporation.
[02:01:13.789 --> 02:01:15.689]  And I'm not trying to sound smart.
[02:01:15.869 --> 02:01:18.789]  I'm just telling you, I know what I'm talking about.
[02:01:18.949 --> 02:01:19.989]  This is what I do.
[02:01:21.170 --> 02:01:28.930]  And I'm telling you, everybody can feel the grave danger, and the left thinks it's because of Trump, and they misdirect their subconscious and spiritual fear.
[02:01:29.369 --> 02:01:43.149]  You know, it's because the globalists are coming to their end and have a nuclear war gun to our head, and martial law gun to our head, and financial collapse gun to our head, and if we don't expose, they're the ones behind it, and a bioweapon gun to our head, they're going to do it!
[02:01:43.210 --> 02:01:44.329]  Probably all of it!
[02:01:46.789 --> 02:02:01.460]  They always lay the groundwork before they do something, and they're laying groundwork At an amplitude and a velocity that is 10 times anything I've ever heard.
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:09.380]  I mean, they are screaming global crises coming out of our rear ends.
[02:02:11.949 --> 02:02:15.409]  And they're doing all this lawless stuff to anybody that's a patriot.
[02:02:15.729 --> 02:02:19.210]  They are doing crazy stuff to me and my crew and my family.
[02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:21.229]  And I don't sit there and go, oh, I'm a victim.
[02:02:22.149 --> 02:02:23.930]  Me, me, me, me.
[02:02:24.069 --> 02:02:24.890]  You know, I said no.
[02:02:25.489 --> 02:02:32.770]  When they sent in armed private security without a warrant or a judge's order to shut us down, and I said to the security, we're not leaving the building.
[02:02:33.590 --> 02:02:34.250]  Where's the warrant?
[02:02:34.329 --> 02:02:34.670]  Where's the court?
[02:02:34.750 --> 02:02:35.170]  They go, you're right.
[02:02:35.210 --> 02:02:35.810]  We're not going to do it.
[02:02:37.130 --> 02:02:40.109]  I didn't go on air that day and say, oh, it's about me.
[02:02:41.109 --> 02:02:43.390]  No, they're about to try to kill Trump.
[02:02:44.210 --> 02:02:45.670]  And what they do a few weeks later.
[02:02:46.270 --> 02:02:47.310]  This is so obvious.
[02:02:50.609 --> 02:02:52.250]  I'm just a century on the wall.
[02:02:53.470 --> 02:02:59.229]  And if I'm sitting there at 2 a.m., And an arrow shoots right by me.
[02:02:59.789 --> 02:03:02.470]  Or an arrow shoots by me and shoots the other sentry in the chest.
[02:03:02.649 --> 02:03:06.210]  And then I look into the woods 60 yards away, and I see a bunch of movement.
[02:03:06.449 --> 02:03:07.810]  I ring the alarm bell.
[02:03:07.949 --> 02:03:09.329]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[02:03:09.590 --> 02:03:12.550]  I light the emergency torches because...
[02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:15.289]  And then 10,000 people come out of the woods with their ladders.
[02:03:17.010 --> 02:03:18.109]  It's on, baby!
[02:03:18.789 --> 02:03:19.869]  So I got arrows going...
[02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:25.859]  The one who kicks me in the arm, I'm like, I'm like, oh, I got hit the arm by an arrow.
[02:03:25.899 --> 02:03:26.699]  I'm like, it's on!
[02:03:26.859 --> 02:03:27.180]  It's on!
[02:03:27.239 --> 02:03:27.920]  The enemy's here!
[02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:28.439]  Get ready!
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:29.279]  Defend yourselves!
[02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:33.539]  And I'm a happy warrior about it.
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:34.760]  God, I'm fired up.
[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:35.520]  I'm climbing the walls.
[02:03:35.619 --> 02:03:36.800]  I got so much damn energy.
[02:03:36.979 --> 02:03:39.199]  That lightning bolt's shooting out my arse.
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:42.720]  And my eyes.
[02:03:43.739 --> 02:03:44.079]  But...
[02:03:47.239 --> 02:03:48.100]  I love Roger Depp.
[02:03:48.180 --> 02:03:48.520]  Super smart.
[02:03:48.619 --> 02:03:51.359]  I'm like, behind the scenes, all he talks about is martial law and the takeover.
[02:03:51.439 --> 02:03:53.680]  But he's like, well, I don't want them to take it out of context when I say.
[02:03:54.079 --> 02:03:59.220]  And I'm not mad at Roger, but he admitted Trump doesn't talk about this because, well, that's weird to talk about martial law.
[02:03:59.380 --> 02:04:00.199]  Well, they're funny.
[02:04:00.399 --> 02:04:03.960]  They're accusing you of it everywhere, every second, because they're getting ready for it.
[02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:05.039]  I mean, my God here.
[02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:08.390]  If arrows are shooting by you at 2 a.m.
[02:04:08.569 --> 02:04:20.569]  up on the parapet, and all of a sudden you see a giant mass of men running out of the woods about to try to climb the walls, are you going to get in trouble if you raise the alarm and say we're under attack?
[02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:23.409]  Da-ding, da-ding, da-ding, da-ding, and light the emergency torches?
[02:04:23.569 --> 02:04:23.770]  No.
[02:04:23.930 --> 02:04:25.770]  If you didn't do it, they'd hang your ass later.
[02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:27.390]  If you keep the city.
[02:04:28.369 --> 02:04:32.789]  So, I'll ring the alarm bells, I'll light the damn torches, and I'll tell you this is going down.
[02:04:34.170 --> 02:04:35.869]  Just like I told you the day they tried to kill him.
[02:04:35.930 --> 02:04:36.890]  The Secret Service stood down.
[02:04:36.989 --> 02:04:37.590]  It's a total setup.
[02:04:37.850 --> 02:04:38.470]  It all came out.
[02:04:38.649 --> 02:04:42.909]  I'm not going to wait and sit here and hesitate while the damn walls are overrun.
[02:04:44.170 --> 02:04:47.210]  Maybe some crazy person just shot an arrow at me in the night.
[02:04:47.949 --> 02:04:50.289]  I'll say later, you know, there's the arrow.
[02:04:50.430 --> 02:04:50.989]  It's over there.
[02:04:51.689 --> 02:04:52.590]  They'll say, good job.
[02:04:52.710 --> 02:04:53.229]  False alarm.
[02:04:54.829 --> 02:04:57.170]  If it was a real attack, you know, you would have saved the city.
[02:04:57.329 --> 02:05:04.949]  But I've had 50 arrows shoot at me and I'm watching 10,000 barbarians run out of the woods about to climb the damn walls, kill the men, and take our women and children.
[02:05:07.489 --> 02:05:09.329]  Literally with the illegal alien invasion.
[02:05:10.489 --> 02:05:11.409]  History just repeats.
[02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:12.630]  It's more complex and bigger.
[02:05:15.930 --> 02:05:24.279]  There's an article up on InfoWars.com by a renowned lip-reader, That Biden and Obama in that exchange were saying we're totally screwed.
[02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:25.520]  She's not strong.
[02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:26.939]  What are we going to do?
[02:05:27.140 --> 02:05:28.260]  Obama says there's still time.
[02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:30.699]  We can still, you know, win.
[02:05:31.579 --> 02:05:34.060]  That's a pretty big article up on InfoWars.com.
[02:05:36.819 --> 02:05:37.920]  Now listen to this.
[02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:53.170]  You've seen the videos, men, women, you name it, where they'll be praying across the street Catty corner from an abortion clinic praying silently and they get arrested, but now they've got the first known conviction of thought crime in modern British history.
[02:05:53.609 --> 02:05:59.869]  The guilty man, a veteran, was spotted praying silently for his dead son outside an abortion clinic.
[02:06:03.770 --> 02:06:04.789]  Prison sentence.
[02:06:05.329 --> 02:06:11.890]  Because you say, oh, well, why do we care what happens to the UK or the EU? Because it's global.
[02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:16.109]  And they're now using EU regulations and laws.
[02:06:16.270 --> 02:06:18.670]  Every time you go to a website that pops up and says, is it okay if we have cookies?
[02:06:18.869 --> 02:06:19.729]  That's an EU law.
[02:06:22.210 --> 02:06:28.630]  We're complying with EU laws and in Congress to pass laws shielding US citizens and companies from other countries' laws.
[02:06:29.050 --> 02:06:36.470]  Like Brazil seizing Starlink assets and arresting ex-employees.
[02:06:39.130 --> 02:06:40.529]  Threatening to arrest Elon Musk.
[02:06:41.170 --> 02:06:57.829]  And then as soon as Elon rolled over to that, which he had no choice because the government didn't stand up for a U.S. citizen, I said, watch, the EU and Australia, I said this two weeks ago, on record, I said, we'll be next seizing not just X, but seizing, and now they said we're going to seize his Boeing division,
[02:06:58.310 --> 02:07:03.649]  Starlink, Tesla, X, SpaceX.
[02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:06.369]  Here's the article right here today.
[02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:09.569]  EU says, yeah, it looks like we're just going to do that.
[02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:18.989]  The EU is going to tell an American citizen, and they say in the statements, he's allowing free speech.
[02:07:18.989 --> 02:07:20.050]  They don't even hide it.
[02:07:22.510 --> 02:07:24.050]  They don't even try to cover it up.
[02:07:24.210 --> 02:07:33.390]  They say there's illegal content or disinformation that they decide, no judge, no jury, that he'll be fined tens of millions of dollars, and they say that's not enough.
[02:07:33.829 --> 02:07:48.720]  Now they say we're going to go after all Of his global revenue, including SpaceX, Neuralink, XAI, and the Boeing division he's got, under the EU's Digital Services Act.
[02:07:49.220 --> 02:07:52.840]  Go read their statements right here for yourself.
[02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:01.359]  And that's why I got a call from one of Musk's people.
[02:08:01.439 --> 02:08:02.199]  I'll leave it at that yesterday.
[02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:02.739]  Legal.
[02:08:04.229 --> 02:08:06.890]  Before I even knew about this filing, I learned about it right after it.
[02:08:07.010 --> 02:08:14.050]  Hey, because they understand the Democrats now say they can own my name and own real Alex Jones.
[02:08:14.609 --> 02:08:23.050]  For those that don't know law, the 13th Amendment, you can't not just make somebody be a slave, you can't take somebody's name or likeness.
[02:08:23.710 --> 02:08:27.470]  But they say, well, Alex Jones is not like other individuals.
[02:08:27.649 --> 02:08:28.470]  The hell I'm not.
[02:08:31.449 --> 02:08:33.369]  It's always the Alex Jones exception.
[02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:38.500]  People are like, well, you know, you raised $300,000 at Real Alex Jones.
[02:08:38.619 --> 02:08:39.619]  That's probably enough for your legal defense.
[02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:45.680]  The Democrats have five in state and federal court, unconstitutional actions against me right now.
[02:08:46.659 --> 02:08:51.960]  We've been beating them because the stuff they're filing isn't in totally rigged courts like they did in Austin and Connecticut.
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:54.840]  And we're winning our appeals against them.
[02:08:56.119 --> 02:09:03.329]  But it takes money to So, as you saw, they claimed that hundreds of millions of dollars, and now I admit none of that was true.
[02:09:03.670 --> 02:09:06.869]  Egg on the Democrats' face, egg on the Sandy Hook Democrat Party combine.
[02:09:07.770 --> 02:09:08.710]  Everything I said was true.
[02:09:08.829 --> 02:09:09.750]  They said, oh, go to jail.
[02:09:09.750 --> 02:09:10.630]  He has all this hidden money.
[02:09:10.670 --> 02:09:11.170]  He's a crook.
[02:09:11.310 --> 02:09:11.670]  Where is it?
[02:09:11.689 --> 02:09:11.930]  Not true.
[02:09:14.010 --> 02:09:22.529]  I've got a $9 million donation of Bitcoin, put it all into the operation, and it was the exact amount we needed in that two-plus years when we did all the accounting.
[02:09:22.649 --> 02:09:24.149]  It was just the number we needed to stay on air.
[02:09:24.710 --> 02:09:25.909]  Crazy how God works through people.
[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:29.680]  So, I don't need $9 million right now.
[02:09:30.300 --> 02:09:31.479]  That'd be really nice.
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:43.180]  What I need is people to go to the AlexJonesStore.com and get t-shirts and high-quality supplements that'll blow you away, that'll change your life that are so amazing, like Ultimate CMOS, an awful human.
[02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:50.439]  And I need you to then go to my legal defense and emergency broadcast fund, but almost all it's going to legal defense.
[02:09:50.979 --> 02:09:53.439]  Some of it's going into a few little other thingies.
[02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:56.689]  And I need money to fight a war.
[02:09:56.869 --> 02:10:06.930]  Go to realalexjones.com, a URL, not X, realalexjones.com, and make a $5,000, $100,000 donation.
[02:10:07.229 --> 02:10:13.649]  You've got all these wealthy, middle-class folks that are conservative and populist that think, well, we'll just keep our heads down.
[02:10:14.010 --> 02:10:16.229]  We are coming to the crux of the battle.
[02:10:17.350 --> 02:10:18.329]  Vote for Trump.
[02:10:18.489 --> 02:10:19.250]  Support Trump.
[02:10:19.590 --> 02:10:21.210]  They're outspending him three to one.
[02:10:21.390 --> 02:10:22.829]  He's still beating him by sheer will.
[02:10:24.079 --> 02:10:24.840]  I'm not Trump.
[02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:25.500]  I'm not Musk.
[02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:27.659]  I don't have a war chest, though we're very effective.
[02:10:27.899 --> 02:10:29.460]  And we're junior to Musk and Trump.
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:37.159]  But in the annals, we have created the blueprint, reverse-engineered diagram of the enemy and how to blow their operation.
[02:10:37.779 --> 02:10:43.859]  And I continue to create research material that's dead-on on enemy weakness points, how to crush them.
[02:10:45.810 --> 02:10:49.210]  And so I believe I'm worthy and my crew is worthy of your support.
[02:10:49.390 --> 02:10:51.270]  And so I'm saying, make the decision.
[02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:53.930]  I want you to consciously say, I'm not going to go to Real Alex Jones and I'm not going to donate.
[02:10:54.369 --> 02:10:54.970]  Okay, fine.
[02:10:55.189 --> 02:10:55.770]  That's your choice.
[02:10:55.850 --> 02:10:56.229]  I respect it.
[02:10:57.289 --> 02:10:58.010]  I'm a Christian.
[02:10:58.130 --> 02:10:58.710]  Trump's not perfect.
[02:10:58.869 --> 02:11:00.430]  I'm just going to vote for Satan by not voting.
[02:11:00.909 --> 02:11:01.770]  Okay, that's your decision.
[02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:11.000]  But if you don't go to Real Alex Jones and donate, just remember when all this happens to you or the people standing up for your rights like myself and Trump and Musk get shut down.
[02:11:11.380 --> 02:11:15.439]  And just remember, you're the target and you did nothing at the point of that.
[02:11:15.779 --> 02:11:16.960]  I know you're praying for the show.
[02:11:17.079 --> 02:11:18.060]  I know you're sharing the articles, videos.
[02:11:18.239 --> 02:11:18.859]  Great, keep doing it.
[02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:21.590]  And those that have supported, I salute you.
[02:11:21.829 --> 02:11:24.149]  But now is not the time for half measures or games.
[02:11:24.289 --> 02:11:25.850]  Go to realalexjones.com and make a donation.
[02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:33.649]  Or just go get the CMOS and feel how great it makes you feel and the amazing things it does so you'll get hooked and then get it from us.
[02:11:35.569 --> 02:11:36.770]  And get some t-shirts.
[02:11:37.609 --> 02:11:41.010]  I mean, you'll probably get, even in a leftist thing, mainly love.
[02:11:41.170 --> 02:11:42.510]  People talk about it online.
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:45.000]  Most areas you'll get nothing but love.
[02:11:45.539 --> 02:11:46.399]  It's an adventure.
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:47.720]  It's a win-win.
[02:11:48.079 --> 02:11:49.039]  The Alex Jones store.com.
[02:11:49.159 --> 02:11:50.159]  The Alex Jones store.com.
[02:11:50.979 --> 02:11:51.680]  Real Alex Jones.
[02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:53.239]  To donate.
[02:11:54.819 --> 02:11:58.180]  I love the two Halloween limited edition shirts.
[02:11:58.260 --> 02:11:59.819]  Those will no longer be available after Halloween.
[02:12:00.399 --> 02:12:01.979]  These are amazing t-shirts.
[02:12:02.399 --> 02:12:03.600]  I can't do it without you.
[02:12:03.619 --> 02:12:04.779]  I want to thank those that have.
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:05.479]  And just say again.
[02:12:06.699 --> 02:12:07.720]  History's happening now.
[02:12:08.039 --> 02:12:09.520]  Oh, we now have women's shirts.
[02:12:09.739 --> 02:12:10.380]  Cut for women.
[02:12:11.739 --> 02:12:15.260]  And even softer fabric, though the men's shirts are really soft and all cotton and really nice as well.
[02:12:15.420 --> 02:12:16.380]  They got the big hoodies.
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:17.840]  They got the ball caps.
[02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:20.640]  I mean, it's got to be over 150 different items in there now.
[02:12:22.479 --> 02:12:25.779]  It's, I mean, Bigly makes the best t-shirts.
[02:12:26.659 --> 02:12:28.760]  So, and they're really just a great sponsor.
[02:12:28.939 --> 02:12:32.560]  And don't forget my dad and his supplement company, the highest quality.
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:34.180]  People go, man, these supplements are just as good as yours.
[02:12:34.779 --> 02:12:36.859]  My dad came to work with me 13 years ago.
[02:12:36.859 --> 02:12:40.100]  He made sure we got the best, private labeled the highest rated or created new formulas.
[02:12:42.090 --> 02:12:58.489]  The next level of foundational energy, no letdown, not a classical stimulant, but acts like one, cleans out your cells, the breakdown of key compounds that your cells can't process, most people can't, like public acid, it's the methylfolate breakdown of that with a bunch of other key compounds.
[02:12:59.050 --> 02:13:08.850]  Next level of foundational energy, the fluoride-free, fortified with nano-silver, iodine, tea tree, and a bunch of other essential oils, super blue toothpaste, it's all there.
[02:13:10.089 --> 02:13:17.590]  At drjonesnaturals.com, a whole food multivitamin, organic, highest quality, the fiber greens, concentrate of the seed sprouts.
[02:13:18.010 --> 02:13:19.470]  Everybody knows a little shot of wheatgrass is great.
[02:13:19.529 --> 02:13:20.189]  That's only one of the ingredients.
[02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:24.609]  This is way beyond each pill, something like 10 shot glasses equivalent.
[02:13:26.449 --> 02:13:30.489]  The gummies are 20 to 1 concentrate of wheatgrass.
[02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:37.109]  The CMOS. The pills are 40 to 1 concentrate.
[02:13:37.770 --> 02:13:41.369]  That's the stuff you get at the AlexJonesStore.com and drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:48.609]  Go there now, get great products, and know you are in the fight for humanity's future, not just for America's future, at the critical juncture.
[02:13:50.569 --> 02:13:53.710]  Everybody's like, watching so much entertainment, so many other shows, people think, oh, this is another show.
[02:13:53.850 --> 02:13:54.810]  This isn't another show.
[02:13:55.229 --> 02:13:57.149]  This is humanity fighting for its very survival.
[02:14:00.260 --> 02:14:03.619]  As you know, I am fighting the deep state to keep my broadcast on air.
[02:14:03.859 --> 02:14:07.699]  But if you simply support my sponsors, we will stay on the air one way or another.
[02:14:07.859 --> 02:14:09.100]  So I thank you for your past support.
[02:14:09.279 --> 02:14:13.800]  But I try to make it easy for you to support our sponsors by bringing you the very best products.
[02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:17.600]  This product, Optimal Human, is simply game-changing.
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:25.199]  Now as you know, green superfoods for decades have been all the rage because they really work and because you absorb things better in the gut.
[02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:26.680]  And there's a lot of great ones out there.
[02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:32.939]  But ladies and gentlemen, Optimal Human has the highest quality ingredients, 90 plus ingredients.
[02:14:33.319 --> 02:14:34.960]  It does amazing things.
[02:14:35.060 --> 02:14:37.659]  I've been taking it for months and I want you to get it.
[02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:40.800]  And understand this, it's leading competitor is amazing.
[02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:43.180]  And I've been using it and love it.
[02:14:43.579 --> 02:14:52.159]  But this has the same ingredients and even more, and it's stronger, and it's the same serving amount, but for a lower price.
[02:14:52.300 --> 02:14:54.439]  So the leading competitor, everybody knows their name.
[02:14:54.579 --> 02:14:56.760]  It starts with A and ends with G. This is amazing.
[02:14:56.899 --> 02:14:59.380]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com and get Awful Human.
[02:14:59.699 --> 02:15:03.880]  For 35 years, I've been researching in-depth the New World Order.
[02:15:04.180 --> 02:15:06.260]  I've been on air 30-plus years.
[02:15:08.119 --> 02:15:16.060]  And I read the books and the publications written by presidents, prime ministers, think tank heads about the hellish world they were going to build.
[02:15:16.239 --> 02:15:20.000]  And I saw that much of what they said they would build, previously they got done.
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:24.460]  So I said, I'm going to fight these people.
[02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:26.939]  Humanity doesn't need to be slaves.
[02:15:26.939 --> 02:15:28.560]  We don't need to go along with this.
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:34.739]  I don't believe humanity will want to be controlled by these monsters and depopulated.
[02:15:35.439 --> 02:15:37.220]  That's not a very hard decision to make.
[02:15:38.090 --> 02:15:41.270]  But people are like, I don't choose to believe these bad things are happening.
[02:15:41.350 --> 02:15:42.369]  That's gloom and doom.
[02:15:42.630 --> 02:15:44.350]  I got a bowling league to go to.
[02:15:44.529 --> 02:15:45.609]  I got a golf game to play.
[02:15:45.850 --> 02:15:47.970]  You don't think I don't love golf?
[02:15:48.130 --> 02:15:49.850]  You don't think I love to bowl?
[02:15:50.029 --> 02:15:53.909]  You don't think I don't love to hunt dove?
[02:15:54.029 --> 02:15:55.710]  You don't think I don't love to hunt elk?
[02:15:55.890 --> 02:15:59.710]  You don't think I don't love to hunt hogs out of a helicopter?
[02:16:01.989 --> 02:16:03.869]  You don't think I don't love to play pool?
[02:16:04.630 --> 02:16:07.229]  You don't think I don't love to go out on a boat?
[02:16:08.289 --> 02:16:09.069]  And drink beer.
[02:16:09.449 --> 02:16:10.470]  Oh, I love it.
[02:16:11.010 --> 02:16:12.729]  I can do it all day long.
[02:16:12.930 --> 02:16:13.489]  Real easy.
[02:16:14.029 --> 02:16:24.789]  But see, if I'm out in a parking lot walking out of a restaurant with my family and some mugger walks up and puts a gun to my head, well, I've got to deal with that.
[02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:31.210]  And instinctively, I'm going to feign that he's in control.
[02:16:31.649 --> 02:16:34.110]  I'm going to grab the gun, force it up.
[02:16:36.739 --> 02:16:54.379]  Squeeze it out of his hand, and then I'm going to jump on top of him in one purposeful move with the decision and intent to kill him, and I'm going to ram his head full power in the concrete, and then five more times, I'm going to slam it with intention and feel the skull break because I have got will.
[02:17:00.770 --> 02:17:14.329]  Now, you have will too, not to just beat somebody's brains out, but to wake up and decide you're under attack and admit you're under attack and then not put up with it politically, culturally, spiritually, and then fire up against these people.
[02:17:20.309 --> 02:17:23.569]  So, you're under attack.
[02:17:23.649 --> 02:17:24.190]  You like it?
[02:17:24.850 --> 02:17:27.209]  You like being pissed all over and crapped all over?
[02:17:27.370 --> 02:17:29.370]  You like these damn pedophiles running everything?
[02:17:31.079 --> 02:17:33.100]  You think your ancestors would like what's going on?
[02:17:33.260 --> 02:17:34.959]  What the hell's going on out there?
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:45.040]  If I went to some stupid football game and painted myself up in the team's colors and yelled and screamed like that, that's a good American.
[02:17:45.739 --> 02:17:50.100]  But I get fired up about trying to stop World War III and it's weird.
[02:17:50.940 --> 02:17:52.540]  And that's why we're screwed up.
[02:17:52.659 --> 02:17:59.959]  But if I was around 150 years ago and the people then could see what was going on, they'd be acting crazier than me.
[02:18:04.860 --> 02:18:06.440]  But we've gotten domesticated.
[02:18:07.239 --> 02:18:08.239]  I didn't give the number down.
[02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:08.639]  I'm an idiot.
[02:18:10.079 --> 02:18:11.280]  So let's take a few calls.
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:12.239]  Here's the toll-free number.
[02:18:12.959 --> 02:18:14.819]  On martial law being openly announced.
[02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:17.200]  The military being announced for martial law and killing us.
[02:18:17.299 --> 02:18:18.319]  And then they say Trump's going to do it.
[02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:19.819]  I mean, that's the big story.
[02:18:20.299 --> 02:18:21.799]  Along with World War III and the open border.
[02:18:22.379 --> 02:18:23.239]  And the human trafficking.
[02:18:23.340 --> 02:18:24.219]  Just to show how bad they are.
[02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:27.040]  That totally convicts and indicts the establishment.
[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:28.540]  Mayorkas and all the scum.
[02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:29.520]  Harris, all of them.
[02:18:31.079 --> 02:18:31.399]  And...
[02:18:32.860 --> 02:18:36.000]  Trump, for all his energy and all his topics, is shooting at the enemy.
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:37.680]  I don't mean this literally, it's an analogy.
[02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:39.920]  With a.301 mag.
[02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:45.680]  Trump's got hydrogen political bombs he can drop on him.
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:48.079]  He's not doing it.
[02:18:49.219 --> 02:18:54.120]  So I can sit up here and just play interesting clips and laugh at Kamala and Bret Baier all day long.
[02:18:55.239 --> 02:18:57.139]  But does that really matter at the end of the day?
[02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:08.840]  877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[02:19:12.620 --> 02:19:17.319]  Now, I've got all this other news, and I'm going to start going over it right now.
[02:19:18.719 --> 02:19:27.520]  But if I wasn't the person this was happening to, I would be covering this just as much as I'm covering it.
[02:19:30.350 --> 02:19:32.030]  I mean, you need to go read the federal filing.
[02:19:32.170 --> 02:19:33.590]  It's linked to the Bloomberg articles and others.
[02:19:34.290 --> 02:19:47.489]  It says, in the filing, in federal court, by the U.S. Trustee's Office of Justice Department, that the 13th Amendment says you can't take somebody's name and use it, or their private social media, but Alex Jones is different, and it doesn't say why.
[02:19:49.870 --> 02:19:50.870]  Might want to read it.
[02:19:51.590 --> 02:19:52.329]  Overhead shot, please.
[02:19:53.489 --> 02:19:59.030]  Now, do you think they're doing that just to get Alex Jones...
[02:20:00.370 --> 02:20:00.729]  No.
[02:20:01.209 --> 02:20:04.950]  Alex Jones bankruptcy trustee aims to sell social media accounts, including his personal accounts.
[02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:06.690]  And they say they own my name.
[02:20:06.809 --> 02:20:09.610]  And right here, it quotes the document.
[02:20:14.170 --> 02:20:20.010]  Alex Jones' social media accounts are not the ordinary accounts of a private citizen.
[02:20:20.469 --> 02:20:25.610]  And the sale of the Jones bankruptcy estate interest in the social media accounts...
[02:20:26.579 --> 02:20:33.399]  Does not require Alex Jones to perform any personal services that would otherwise violate the 13th Amendment prohibition of slavery.
[02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:39.739]  But it does, and the previous rulings say you can't take somebody's social media.
[02:20:40.459 --> 02:20:45.639]  That's why, and that's why not just X, but the others say you can't transfer your personal account.
[02:20:47.180 --> 02:20:54.399]  Yeah, if I was a car dealership owner, because I had the law firms look it up, I already knew what it was going to say.
[02:20:54.559 --> 02:20:55.079]  I already know the law.
[02:20:56.360 --> 02:21:07.739]  And I went bankrupt, and the car dealership had a Facebook account that it had run advertising on and built up over years.
[02:21:08.420 --> 02:21:11.680]  You could transfer that in the bankruptcy to the creditors.
[02:21:11.840 --> 02:21:24.659]  But if the owner, Big Bob, or whatever his name is, has his own personal account that he puts pictures up of his kids and occasionally promotes his dealership with, you don't get it because it's Big Bob.
[02:21:29.319 --> 02:21:36.680]  They're saying, yeah, you can still be Alex Jones, but you can't say it's the Alex Jones show that's in the filing, and you can't use real Alex Jones because we own that.
[02:21:37.180 --> 02:21:44.700]  That's like telling you you can't hang a sign outside your barbershop saying come into David's Barbershop.
[02:21:46.180 --> 02:21:51.639]  Oh, you went bankrupt, so now you can't call it David's Barbershop when you reopen it after you're bankrupt.
[02:21:52.579 --> 02:21:54.260]  So again, they never wanted money.
[02:21:54.559 --> 02:21:55.280]  They've said it.
[02:21:55.319 --> 02:21:55.959]  I played the clips.
[02:21:59.270 --> 02:22:00.309]  They want me silenced.
[02:22:01.889 --> 02:22:09.370]  And everyone should be rallying behind Elon Musk and Trump and myself.
[02:22:11.430 --> 02:22:15.049]  But instead, people are like, oh, well, Brazil started seizing the companies and everything.
[02:22:15.250 --> 02:22:17.809]  And yeah, now that you used to take over X, whatever.
[02:22:18.450 --> 02:22:19.930]  You know, Elon Musk getting perfect anyways.
[02:22:20.049 --> 02:22:21.010]  You know, let's just let him do that.
[02:22:22.020 --> 02:22:24.920]  Because, you know, you don't want to look like you're brown-nosing Elon Musk.
[02:22:25.059 --> 02:22:25.719]  I mean, you don't want to.
[02:22:25.840 --> 02:22:37.659]  You're holier than thou as the super patriot, and, you know, he's not perfect, so screw X and screw E. Okay.
[02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:40.739]  See where that gets you.
[02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:49.319]  Speaking of the EU, EU's digital ID push sparks fears of privacy and rushed rollout, and it's all with the UN and Bill Gates standardizing it for the whole world.
[02:22:50.739 --> 02:22:57.959]  And it'll be used as internet IDs where you can't get on the internet unless they have your identity, and then they can ban you whenever they want and kick you off the web for your behavior.
[02:22:58.319 --> 02:22:59.379]  People are like, why don't they hide?
[02:22:59.420 --> 02:23:03.040]  Let me have a digital ID. They're going to use it to control you.
[02:23:03.100 --> 02:23:04.280]  That's why they don't have one.
[02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:05.059]  It's dangerous.
[02:23:09.379 --> 02:23:11.559]  And it's because the system knows they're losing.
[02:23:11.700 --> 02:23:12.579]  They admit they're losing.
[02:23:13.840 --> 02:23:15.299]  Right here, great news.
[02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:17.540]  Americans trusting mass media hits all-time low.
[02:23:22.370 --> 02:23:23.090]  Look at this.
[02:23:25.809 --> 02:23:29.489]  Disgraced Fulton County DA. Boy, every one of these DA's has been disgraced.
[02:23:30.709 --> 02:23:34.649]  Fannie Willis begs court to reinstate, dropped Trump charges.
[02:23:35.389 --> 02:23:38.549]  She needs to go to prison for all the money laundering and lies and perjury.
[02:23:39.549 --> 02:23:40.569]  Here's another one.
[02:23:41.430 --> 02:23:45.190]  The views Joy Behar worried about Trump's trending positive and winning.
[02:23:45.350 --> 02:23:46.069]  Think so?
[02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:54.790]  Biden-Harris-DOJ to monitor voting over intimidation concerns of Trump voters.
[02:23:55.870 --> 02:23:56.350]  Huh?
[02:23:57.049 --> 02:24:02.170]  Kamala won't support voter ID because rural Americans don't have access to photocopy machines.
[02:24:02.270 --> 02:24:05.489]  Is that where you get your driver's license or ID? From a photocopying machine?
[02:24:06.170 --> 02:24:07.469]  No, it's so illegal aliens can vote.
[02:24:07.569 --> 02:24:08.090]  They admit it.
[02:24:09.430 --> 02:24:17.569]  My God, the Secretary of State in Texas, two weeks ago, came out in an official statement and said, and in a video to the key...
[02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:20.170]  Polling place officials.
[02:24:21.090 --> 02:24:24.409]  Somebody doesn't need a US ID. They don't need to be a citizen to vote.
[02:24:24.729 --> 02:24:24.989]  Okay.
[02:24:25.850 --> 02:24:30.889]  But they indicted Trump in Georgia and one of the indictment points is disinformation.
[02:24:31.250 --> 02:24:32.250]  That's not even a law.
[02:24:33.049 --> 02:24:34.530]  But Fannie Willis put it in there.
[02:24:35.209 --> 02:24:37.030]  Trump says illegals are voting.
[02:24:37.170 --> 02:24:39.930]  Turned out way more voted in Georgia than he thought did.
[02:24:42.149 --> 02:24:44.850]  More than 30,000 illegals confirmed to vote in Georgia.
[02:24:45.149 --> 02:24:47.469]  How many votes did Trump lose Georgia by?
[02:24:48.329 --> 02:24:49.930]  I forget because I mixed it all together.
[02:24:50.629 --> 02:24:52.309]  I think Georgia was 6,000 votes.
[02:24:53.629 --> 02:24:55.469]  Michigan was like 12,000 or something.
[02:24:56.110 --> 02:24:56.930]  Look it up.
[02:25:01.309 --> 02:25:02.649]  Because they were so lazy.
[02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:03.569]  They knew Trump once.
[02:25:03.690 --> 02:25:05.770]  They would just go stuff because Biden was so far behind.
[02:25:06.010 --> 02:25:06.590]  You've seen the graph.
[02:25:06.889 --> 02:25:07.709]  Trump's right here.
[02:25:07.850 --> 02:25:08.670]  Biden's way below him.
[02:25:09.049 --> 02:25:11.129]  And then, man, that's perfect.
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:19.680]  There's a big report with videos you gotta watch on Infowars.
[02:25:19.780 --> 02:25:26.040]  I don't have time to play it all, but Canadian woman shares appalling story of Care Center trying to execute her father.
[02:25:26.219 --> 02:25:28.540]  That's going on all over the Western world.
[02:25:28.659 --> 02:25:31.200]  The Netherlands is the epicenter of it, but now Canada is.
[02:25:33.299 --> 02:25:37.059]  You know, I told you about this 25 years ago.
[02:25:39.219 --> 02:25:45.120]  Back then, the TVs weren't smart, meaning they weren't robot computers with all the microphones and cameras hidden in them.
[02:25:45.159 --> 02:25:50.280]  It was the cable boxes, particularly the Scientific Atlantic cable box.
[02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:56.520]  And boy, I got harassed by the FBI after I broke that story.
[02:25:58.239 --> 02:26:05.299]  Disgraced Fulton County DA Fannie Willis begs court to reinstate dropped Trump charges.
[02:26:06.809 --> 02:26:26.430]  And now this, smart TVs, a vast system of digital surveillance that targets everyone, especially kids, with built-in microphones and cameras, and in the terms of service of all the major companies, they tell you that they are recording and videoing you and that you better watch what you do.
[02:26:26.610 --> 02:26:29.610]  The actual, I covered this 11 years ago.
[02:26:30.590 --> 02:26:43.530]  I remember my divorce started with my first wife 11 years ago and I move out and I go, well, I'll get a new TV. And I go buy a Samsung TV. Let me just read the terms of service.
[02:26:43.649 --> 02:26:45.069]  It's 20, 30 pages long.
[02:26:45.450 --> 02:26:53.409]  And it actually said, don't do anything you're not supposed to do because we're videoing and audioing you and selling it to third parties.
[02:26:54.190 --> 02:26:57.909]  And I showed that on air.
[02:26:57.950 --> 02:26:59.790]  We ought to find the video I shot of that.
[02:27:01.170 --> 02:27:02.149]  And played on air.
[02:27:02.370 --> 02:27:03.729]  And people are like, that's not true.
[02:27:03.889 --> 02:27:07.909]  My TV. And then too lazy to go pull it up in the terms of service.
[02:27:09.790 --> 02:27:11.190]  What do you think your phone does?
[02:27:11.329 --> 02:27:12.549]  What do you think all this crap does?
[02:27:12.889 --> 02:27:16.170]  Ford just got in trouble because they got caught listening to everybody in the car.
[02:27:16.409 --> 02:27:17.270]  And videotaping.
[02:27:17.569 --> 02:27:18.409]  Not videotaping.
[02:27:18.649 --> 02:27:19.430]  Camera recording.
[02:27:22.510 --> 02:27:23.530]  They're all doing it.
[02:27:24.049 --> 02:27:25.290]  And it's just ubiquitous.
[02:27:25.649 --> 02:27:28.870]  And then I'm telling people when it's first coming out 25 years ago...
[02:27:30.629 --> 02:27:46.290]  I remember 25 years ago, going under the new Telecommunications Act of 96, under federal law, all cell phones use cell phone towers to triangulate GPS and track everywhere you go,
[02:27:46.450 --> 02:27:49.069]  and people are like, you're making that up, they don't do that, that's not happening.
[02:27:50.850 --> 02:27:51.930]  And now everybody knows it.
[02:27:51.930 --> 02:27:58.209]  See, they just get it out there where it's totally normalized, and then you just accept it, like the pedophilia, like the drag queen story time.
[02:27:58.209 --> 02:27:58.930]  Let's go to phone calls.
[02:28:00.020 --> 02:28:02.040]  Brian in Minnesota, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:28:02.219 --> 02:28:02.680]  Thanks for calling.
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:04.200]  It's an honor, Alex.
[02:28:05.020 --> 02:28:10.600]  I've been a software and hardware engineer for decades, and I think that one of the most important things right now is communication.
[02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:15.639]  Obviously, we can see how they've been trying to break that down during COVID-1984, etc.
[02:28:15.899 --> 02:28:17.840]  Communication is the thing that they fear most.
[02:28:18.979 --> 02:28:26.420]  I think that we should all be setting up at the very least, practically, CB radio systems, but there's also the capability of using software-defined radio.
[02:28:26.799 --> 02:28:27.899]  Everybody can do this.
[02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:42.940]  I can send you the open source code and the schematics where we can set up neighborhood-based communication sectors, which can allow neighbors to communicate if everything gets shut off, and this can be run on solar power or any kind of renewable energy, even a crankshaft.
[02:28:43.100 --> 02:28:55.309]  So I think it's essential that we all set up communication systems to be We're ready to be able to communicate with each other and if martial law were to break out to keep reminding our neighbors do not play into the trap of civil unrest.
[02:28:57.409 --> 02:28:57.809]  Absolutely.
[02:28:58.090 --> 02:29:02.989]  And then when illegal aliens loot your house and you fight back, they're going to say, white man murders innocent Hispanics.
[02:29:03.670 --> 02:29:07.110]  They create the crisis and then they exacerbate.
[02:29:07.209 --> 02:29:14.350]  I mean, like the media, for two weeks before the police released the body cam in Virginia, they do a well check on the lady.
[02:29:14.750 --> 02:29:17.190]  She opens the door, tries to stab him, does stab him.
[02:29:17.389 --> 02:29:20.510]  And then Black Lives Matter said, white cop shoots unarmed woman.
[02:29:20.549 --> 02:29:21.270]  We need riots.
[02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:23.649]  And then, of course, later it turns out none of it's true.
[02:29:23.829 --> 02:29:26.329]  But that's exactly what's going to happen during all this.
[02:29:27.059 --> 02:29:27.420]  Exactly.
[02:29:27.760 --> 02:29:30.040]  And, yep, I can't agree with you more.
[02:29:30.219 --> 02:29:32.340]  And then communication, again, to remind our neighbors.
[02:29:32.819 --> 02:29:37.500]  And then if anybody could patch into your show, that can be broadcast over this neighborhood sector.
[02:29:38.780 --> 02:29:45.760]  Even if it's not a public show, I'm not sure how you're going to do this if the worst-case scenario happens with these illegal cases.
[02:29:45.940 --> 02:29:51.340]  Well, I'll tell you, listen, if they do this selective internet kill switch grid control, they'll do it in selected sectors.
[02:29:51.340 --> 02:29:56.159]  They're just going to cut all the patriots off immediately, probably kill Musk, Trump at the same time, probably kill me, Tucker Carlson.
[02:29:56.260 --> 02:29:56.959]  I mean, that's the plan.
[02:29:58.250 --> 02:30:05.309]  It won't be my current show you'll hear, but any old show will be just as pertinent in the future as any live program.
[02:30:05.790 --> 02:30:09.110]  That's where everybody should be saving the archives and saving the shows to your hard drives.
[02:30:09.409 --> 02:30:16.809]  If we go into the total takeover, the information on the show will be ultra green, meaning more powerful than it is today.
[02:30:17.649 --> 02:30:19.069]  That's exactly what I've been thinking.
[02:30:19.229 --> 02:30:23.190]  And then I'd be able to rebroadcast that and remind people, look, this has already been planned.
[02:30:23.190 --> 02:30:24.690]  This is what we need to do.
[02:30:26.389 --> 02:30:27.129]  Yeah, that's fantastic.
[02:30:27.170 --> 02:30:28.409]  I do download all your shows.
[02:30:28.569 --> 02:30:40.430]  I'm trying to find, I'm not sure exactly where to go to get all the video archives, but I do have almost every single show, and sometimes I record it live just for this exact purpose in case we had to do that.
[02:30:40.450 --> 02:30:54.649]  Well, the last CRO here, when he was getting rid of our sponsors and shutting everything down while he claimed he was our best buddy and trying to set me up and all the rest of it, he would not pay for the archive system, and so it shut down.
[02:30:55.629 --> 02:31:01.610]  And then now the new U.S. trustee, they're asking us, where's your video archives?
[02:31:01.909 --> 02:31:05.829]  And we're like, we have it on record that it didn't get paid and they didn't fix it.
[02:31:06.389 --> 02:31:11.190]  I mean, it's like when the Sandy Hook people said, take his videos down, he's attacking us, which I wasn't even talking about him.
[02:31:11.389 --> 02:31:13.350]  They were all part of getting me banned.
[02:31:13.649 --> 02:31:17.049]  And then they turned around and said, default him, his archive is gone.
[02:31:18.010 --> 02:31:23.530]  So, you know, we use YouTube as like the cloud, which is what it is, and, you know, where you don't keep stuff yourself.
[02:31:23.629 --> 02:31:24.670]  I know you know that as a software guy.
[02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:25.549]  It's just crazy.
[02:31:25.690 --> 02:31:26.209]  Thanks for the call.
[02:31:26.729 --> 02:31:28.649]  Hey, do what you can, folks.
[02:31:31.370 --> 02:31:38.129]  They're also claiming in federal court, the Democrats are, that Bandot Video is owned by them.
[02:31:40.449 --> 02:31:43.850]  And that everyone that's contributed to Bandout Video, they own your stuff.
[02:31:43.969 --> 02:31:46.569]  And we're like, no, the way the contract works is the same with Facebook or YouTube or anything.
[02:31:46.770 --> 02:31:47.610]  It's your content.
[02:31:47.790 --> 02:31:52.250]  We have users that go on there and they follow the rules, not have porn or crime or anything illegal.
[02:31:52.450 --> 02:31:54.889]  It's like the internet was free 10 years ago.
[02:31:54.969 --> 02:31:56.090]  Just don't violate the law.
[02:31:56.229 --> 02:31:57.329]  And we got great folks that don't.
[02:31:57.750 --> 02:31:59.629]  And we got hundreds and hundreds of contributors on there.
[02:31:59.709 --> 02:32:00.770]  And they're just like, no, we own all that too.
[02:32:02.049 --> 02:32:05.510]  It's not like, it's just, we own you, we own your name, we own all your people.
[02:32:05.690 --> 02:32:06.690]  We own you, we own you, we own you.
[02:32:07.889 --> 02:32:08.690]  I just showed you the article.
[02:32:08.889 --> 02:32:12.069]  Well, you know, 13 in a minute applies to everybody but Alex Jones, and anybody on that video.
[02:32:12.610 --> 02:32:13.989]  Of course, it's lawsuit city.
[02:32:14.129 --> 02:32:16.370]  You can all go file on the federal court and challenge it if you want.
[02:32:17.290 --> 02:32:18.690]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[02:32:18.889 --> 02:32:20.610]  But see, they have unlimited money, so they don't care.
[02:32:21.209 --> 02:32:23.010]  They just hope I run out of money fighting them.
[02:32:23.110 --> 02:32:24.149]  But we're going to beat everything.
[02:32:24.250 --> 02:32:24.969]  We're going to defeat them.
[02:32:25.030 --> 02:32:25.649]  We're going to crush them.
[02:32:25.709 --> 02:32:26.430]  You're supporting us.
[02:32:27.250 --> 02:32:29.270]  I'm not going to say we have a robust defense or anything.
[02:32:29.930 --> 02:32:32.610]  That's why I keep begging and begging for support, because I want to win.
[02:32:33.709 --> 02:32:35.729]  And I think keeping us around is an important part of the fight.
[02:32:35.850 --> 02:32:36.690]  But hey, you make the decision.
[02:32:37.250 --> 02:32:39.250]  Thealexjonesstore.com, realalexjones.com to donate.
[02:32:39.829 --> 02:32:41.409]  Jay in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:32:41.469 --> 02:32:41.809]  Go ahead.
[02:32:43.129 --> 02:32:43.790]  Hey, Alex.
[02:32:43.790 --> 02:32:44.209]  How you doing?
[02:32:44.430 --> 02:32:44.969]  All right, brother.
[02:32:45.010 --> 02:32:45.270]  Go ahead.
[02:32:46.309 --> 02:32:53.790]  Yeah, I just want to let you know, when that judge came out, or that attorney came out and said, Don, if you think about supporting Alex Jones, you're crazy.
[02:32:53.930 --> 02:32:57.850]  The first thing I did was went to the website and bought The Great Awakening.
[02:32:58.389 --> 02:33:01.909]  And then also got the Mineral Fusion and the...
[02:33:06.829 --> 02:33:07.950]  You're keeping us on air.
[02:33:08.090 --> 02:33:15.850]  And remember, that's the former federal prosecutor famous for setting up the Republican governor who was innocent in Connecticut, putting him in prison, works directly for Blumenthal and his son.
[02:33:17.930 --> 02:33:20.030]  They keep saying, we want money, we want money.
[02:33:20.110 --> 02:33:23.190]  And then they admit in the filings, we don't want money, shut down InfoWars.
[02:33:24.129 --> 02:33:26.350]  And then they still say, Alex won't give us his money.
[02:33:26.489 --> 02:33:28.129]  So they think you're stupid.
[02:33:29.769 --> 02:33:33.290]  It's absurd the amount of money they even save for somebody to pay.
[02:33:34.909 --> 02:33:35.489]  It's crazy.
[02:33:35.729 --> 02:33:36.610]  I can't even find a word for it.
[02:33:36.610 --> 02:33:38.190]  Well, when you got rigged courts, that's what you do.
[02:33:38.309 --> 02:33:40.229]  You lie and say I have hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:33:40.450 --> 02:33:47.530]  You lie and say I made it off them when they run fundraisers off me for the last six, seven years and raised hundreds of millions of dollars admittedly.
[02:33:47.790 --> 02:33:48.969]  They stalk me.
[02:33:49.129 --> 02:33:49.969]  They lie about me.
[02:33:50.049 --> 02:33:51.370]  They say I'm attacking them.
[02:33:51.709 --> 02:33:53.170]  Didn't do anything to these people.
[02:33:53.790 --> 02:33:56.889]  And then again, I said the name of one of the plaintiffs.
[02:33:57.049 --> 02:33:59.510]  The internet said the video looked weird of him laughing.
[02:33:59.809 --> 02:34:01.629]  I showed it and said, yeah, it looks weird to me.
[02:34:01.770 --> 02:34:04.969]  And then he just runs around as a victim all over the news raising money.
[02:34:05.069 --> 02:34:06.370]  Oh God, Alex is attacking me.
[02:34:06.450 --> 02:34:08.190]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:34:08.750 --> 02:34:09.850]  And people see through it.
[02:34:10.069 --> 02:34:13.350]  You go to YouTube even and 99% of the comments see through these people.
[02:34:13.770 --> 02:34:15.250]  So they just keep going though.
[02:34:15.290 --> 02:34:15.989]  They just keep going.
[02:34:16.090 --> 02:34:16.709]  They just don't care.
[02:34:18.159 --> 02:34:18.659]  Anything else?
[02:34:18.780 --> 02:34:19.079]  For sure.
[02:34:19.659 --> 02:34:23.799]  I want to also let everybody know that if you download the app XRecorder, it's free.
[02:34:23.979 --> 02:34:30.879]  You can watch your show daily, clip important parts and articles, and post them to Facebook.
[02:34:31.219 --> 02:34:33.260]  And Facebook does not pick up on that.
[02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:36.739]  So you are getting out there on Facebook, or at least I'm trying to.
[02:34:36.899 --> 02:34:37.780]  I lost a few times.
[02:34:39.379 --> 02:34:40.979]  What app are you using to do that with?
[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:43.000]  It's called XRecorder.
[02:34:43.879 --> 02:34:47.459]  Like an orange little app logo thing.
[02:34:48.030 --> 02:34:48.930]  Well, it's free.
[02:34:49.229 --> 02:34:51.770]  You can edit and trim videos right on your phone.
[02:34:53.389 --> 02:34:54.270]  Well, that's great.
[02:34:54.530 --> 02:35:00.030]  I mean, listen, it's not that you're important as listeners getting clips.
[02:35:00.170 --> 02:35:00.850]  You're everything.
[02:35:01.329 --> 02:35:04.370]  I mean, the audience needs to get it.
[02:35:04.489 --> 02:35:06.190]  This is a participation sport.
[02:35:06.649 --> 02:35:07.950]  I know most of you get it, but some don't.
[02:35:08.229 --> 02:35:10.250]  It's not like I'm the special guy here.
[02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:11.670]  I'm just a focal point of this.
[02:35:11.850 --> 02:35:13.870]  What they hate is the audience of activists.
[02:35:14.989 --> 02:35:17.530]  The guests, they hate everything about this.
[02:35:17.629 --> 02:35:20.989]  I'm just the guy crazy enough to get up here and take these people on.
[02:35:21.149 --> 02:35:22.209]  I appreciate your call, brother.
[02:35:22.709 --> 02:35:30.989]  And I'll tell you, I'm upset about what's happening, but I'm climbing the walls with the joy of battle.
[02:35:31.649 --> 02:35:33.110]  I mean, I don't like the tyranny.
[02:35:33.209 --> 02:35:35.090]  I hate it, but it's so intense.
[02:35:35.090 --> 02:35:35.950]  It's so crazy.
[02:35:35.950 --> 02:35:43.450]  We're having so many victories that I'm having the time of my life because I'm doing what I know is right.
[02:35:44.459 --> 02:35:47.860]  And I have the worst enemies, the worst people hate my guts.
[02:35:48.399 --> 02:35:50.799]  And the word isn't pride.
[02:35:51.020 --> 02:35:52.239]  I know you feel this as well, folks.
[02:35:52.399 --> 02:35:52.840]  I love you.
[02:35:53.920 --> 02:35:54.659]  We're like family.
[02:35:54.760 --> 02:35:55.260]  We are family.
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:56.719]  Spiritual family.
[02:35:56.860 --> 02:35:57.239]  We love God.
[02:35:57.299 --> 02:35:57.739]  We love justice.
[02:35:57.840 --> 02:35:58.940]  We're just decent, hardworking people.
[02:35:59.020 --> 02:35:59.579]  We're badasses.
[02:36:00.500 --> 02:36:02.059]  You never want to mess with a good guy.
[02:36:02.139 --> 02:36:02.860]  Everybody knows they're the toughest.
[02:36:03.299 --> 02:36:04.860]  And you guys are amazing.
[02:36:05.059 --> 02:36:07.639]  The toughest when it comes to working hard and being strong and doing the right thing.
[02:36:08.079 --> 02:36:09.819]  And open a can and we'll pass if you got to.
[02:36:11.069 --> 02:36:18.870]  It's a feeling of decency and your ancestors and your current family and your future progeny.
[02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:24.049]  You just know you're doing the right thing and it just feels like you're where you're supposed to be.
[02:36:24.729 --> 02:36:25.989]  People call that pride.
[02:36:26.309 --> 02:36:27.629]  Pride is like, I'm so great.
[02:36:27.729 --> 02:36:28.610]  I'm feeling so good about myself.
[02:36:28.750 --> 02:36:29.329]  That's not what I mean.
[02:36:29.729 --> 02:36:34.549]  It's a feeling of completion and doing what you're supposed to do and having your head screwed on straight.
[02:36:34.969 --> 02:36:43.260]  And I value the most evil people on earth hating me As the third most important thing in my life.
[02:36:44.020 --> 02:36:52.200]  God, my family, and that means all of us together, an extension of my family.
[02:36:52.299 --> 02:36:53.100]  I'm an extension of your family.
[02:36:53.159 --> 02:36:53.799]  That's what it is.
[02:36:53.959 --> 02:36:55.159]  We're a tribe of liberty.
[02:36:55.440 --> 02:36:56.360]  Every race, color, and creed.
[02:36:56.459 --> 02:36:57.020]  We can feel it.
[02:36:57.219 --> 02:36:58.360]  You can feel it, can't you?
[02:36:58.799 --> 02:37:00.120]  Our destiny is freedom.
[02:37:00.260 --> 02:37:01.239]  Our ancestors were strong.
[02:37:01.440 --> 02:37:02.159]  We're going to be strong.
[02:37:02.260 --> 02:37:04.000]  We're becoming strong and we're waking up.
[02:37:05.379 --> 02:37:05.780]  And...
[02:37:06.909 --> 02:37:10.209]  It's stepping into timelessness, to the past, the present, the future.
[02:37:10.370 --> 02:37:11.969]  It's doing what you're supposed to do.
[02:37:11.989 --> 02:37:14.389]  It's fulfilling your destiny.
[02:37:15.090 --> 02:37:16.069]  That's what it is.
[02:37:16.409 --> 02:37:18.170]  And I'm fulfilling my destiny.
[02:37:20.209 --> 02:37:23.350]  I mean, this is not even a high.
[02:37:23.530 --> 02:37:26.930]  It's not even exhilaration or ecstasy.
[02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:30.149]  It is timelessness.
[02:37:30.370 --> 02:37:35.129]  It is stepping into your true purpose.
[02:37:36.510 --> 02:37:38.129]  And it's the most beautiful thing ever.
[02:37:38.870 --> 02:37:42.049]  I'll take a few more calls and then hand the baton to the great Drew Hernandez.
[02:37:42.549 --> 02:37:50.709]  Jared, Eric, Darcy, and Steve, and then Drew Hernandez, always loaded for bear, is going to be taking over ahead of the mighty Owen Schroyer, 3 p.m.
[02:37:51.209 --> 02:37:52.709]  Central today.
[02:37:53.569 --> 02:37:56.549]  And we're talking about 26 days.
[02:37:56.690 --> 02:37:58.170]  Hell, it's really 25 now.
[02:37:59.430 --> 02:38:00.850]  Trying to broadcast every day.
[02:38:02.989 --> 02:38:15.610]  I said I was going to do an emergency Saturday show because I want to broadcast every day, but I've got to run around behind the scenes and build infrastructure and get energon cubes.
[02:38:15.809 --> 02:38:18.049]  That's all money is to me is energy to do the right thing.
[02:38:18.770 --> 02:38:21.649]  And we're working on getting the energon cubes.
[02:38:24.389 --> 02:38:34.840]  And I just had this instinctive spiritual understanding that I should not just maintain under attack That I've been wrong in only trying to maintain.
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:37.920]  Because when you maintain, you get ground down and actually get reversed.
[02:38:38.079 --> 02:38:38.260]  No.
[02:38:39.059 --> 02:38:40.120]  Shoot for the moon.
[02:38:40.340 --> 02:38:41.120]  Go all the way.
[02:38:41.780 --> 02:38:42.719]  Swing for the fences.
[02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:43.840]  Total commitment.
[02:38:44.879 --> 02:38:49.280]  And so I pledge to you to intensify the energy and focus.
[02:38:49.340 --> 02:38:50.479]  To intensify the broadcast.
[02:38:50.639 --> 02:38:51.639]  To intensify the mission.
[02:38:51.719 --> 02:38:52.719]  To intensify the truth.
[02:38:53.559 --> 02:38:54.819]  To intensify.
[02:38:55.059 --> 02:38:56.239]  And we are intensifying.
[02:38:56.620 --> 02:38:57.100]  Intensifying.
[02:38:57.340 --> 02:38:58.280]  Raising to the challenge.
[02:38:58.620 --> 02:39:01.000]  Just like that great song, Eye of the Tiger.
[02:39:01.930 --> 02:39:03.750]  Let's come in at 6 after with Eye of the Tiger.
[02:39:04.049 --> 02:39:05.569]  Rising up to the challenge, folks.
[02:39:06.809 --> 02:39:11.829]  This is something that's next level and something I'm going to be talking a lot about, and I only bring you things that are game-changing.
[02:39:11.989 --> 02:39:16.709]  But of everything we've ever put out, this is the game-changer.
[02:39:17.129 --> 02:39:21.670]  If you think X2 and X3, deep-earth crystal ionium, are game-changing, they are.
[02:39:21.969 --> 02:39:24.350]  Nobody ever put this out until I started 12 years ago.
[02:39:24.750 --> 02:39:28.989]  If you get a DEA license from deep-earth crystals on the ground, it goes right into your bloodstream.
[02:39:29.090 --> 02:39:29.850]  It does amazing things.
[02:39:31.030 --> 02:39:58.709]  The only thing you could say might be as good or maybe even better is sea moss and that's why it's been all the rage the last few years because it has no mercury in it unlike fish but it's bioavailable because it's in the special type of sea moss and it delivers all these super nutrients and the ring structures of how the nutrients are together bound with the iodine and other things does incredible things in the body.
[02:39:59.870 --> 02:40:10.409]  So if you want energy, libido, stamina, immune system, your skin to look beautiful, if you think the iodine was great, this is next level.
[02:40:10.590 --> 02:40:12.450]  It's the ultimate CMOS gummies.
[02:40:12.569 --> 02:40:13.290]  It's a concentrate.
[02:40:13.549 --> 02:40:14.549]  It's super strong.
[02:40:14.549 --> 02:40:16.209]  It will blow you away.
[02:40:16.690 --> 02:40:20.430]  It'll take a week or so for the effects for you to start seeing, and I've got to take it for a month.
[02:40:20.610 --> 02:40:21.469]  It's incredible.
[02:40:21.629 --> 02:40:23.889]  I've been taking these for over a month.
[02:40:24.010 --> 02:40:27.870]  It's one of the reasons that I'm so much healthier and look so much better.
[02:40:28.569 --> 02:40:32.090]  And now it's available to you exclusively at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:40:32.350 --> 02:40:34.530]  There's a lot of CMOS out there and a lot of it's great.

[02:40:50.229 --> 02:41:02.370]  CMOS is a natural source of iodine in a key type, which is in the plant, so it goes differently into the body, which is essential for maintaining healthy thyroid function, helping regulate your metabolism and hormone production.
[02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:07.479]  Rich in nutrients that are in a just super organic bioavailable form.
[02:41:07.700 --> 02:41:09.479]  It all goes together.
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:09.979]  It's next level.
[02:41:10.639 --> 02:41:20.639]  Seamoss is packed with vitamins and minerals like iodine, iron, magnesium, potassium, vitamins A, C, and K. These nutrients support overall health, including immune function and energy levels.
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:23.180]  So you need to get it.

[02:41:39.459 --> 02:41:41.659]  Nobody has got something at this quality.
[02:41:42.319 --> 02:41:46.020]  This is the best from the top manufacturer that lets us private label it.
[02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:47.579]  There's only one other place to get it.
[02:41:47.840 --> 02:41:48.899]  There's hundreds of brands of this.
[02:41:48.979 --> 02:41:49.600]  This is the best.
[02:41:50.059 --> 02:41:52.600]  This is the best at thealexjohnstore.com.
[02:41:52.739 --> 02:41:55.020]  It'll blow you away and it keeps us on air one way or another.

[02:42:07.250 --> 02:42:08.549]  Jared, Missouri, you're on the air.
[02:42:08.649 --> 02:42:08.870]  Welcome.
[02:42:10.989 --> 02:42:11.690]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:42:11.850 --> 02:42:12.209]  Good, brother.
[02:42:12.329 --> 02:42:12.569]  Welcome.
[02:42:14.049 --> 02:42:16.170]  I just was calling about everything.
[02:42:16.370 --> 02:42:19.290]  They got the rules for radicals, tactics happening.
[02:42:19.489 --> 02:42:21.170]  I know you've talked about that many times.
[02:42:21.270 --> 02:42:21.670]  Oh, exactly.
[02:42:21.850 --> 02:42:25.129]  Infuse your enemy of what you're going to do, and he pledged the book, Saul Alinsky to Lucifer.
[02:42:26.290 --> 02:42:26.610]  Absolutely.
[02:42:26.930 --> 02:42:28.329]  And I have a couple bullet points.
[02:42:28.409 --> 02:42:30.250]  I'll make it brief so you can move on, and I apologize.
[02:42:30.489 --> 02:42:31.069]  I appreciate your time.
[02:42:31.229 --> 02:42:31.829]  I love you, brother.
[02:42:31.889 --> 02:42:32.190]  Go ahead.
[02:42:32.370 --> 02:42:32.409]  That's correct.
[02:42:32.899 --> 02:42:34.159]  Yeah, misdirection.
[02:42:34.299 --> 02:42:40.180]  By accusing an opponent of what you yourself are doing, you shift attention away from your own actions and create confusion.
[02:42:40.520 --> 02:42:42.059]  And there's also guilt by association.
[02:42:42.420 --> 02:42:48.899]  By linking your opponent to the behavior you're accusing them of, you attempt to taint their reputation to undermine public trust.
[02:42:49.620 --> 02:42:50.059]  Diversion.
[02:42:50.420 --> 02:42:56.860]  The tactic can distract from the actual issues, evidence making it harder for opponents to officially counter your claims.
[02:42:57.540 --> 02:43:08.959]  Unite people around a common enemy or perceived injustice rather than focus on the actual issues and also create a sense of urgency like Kamala did in that interview by framing the opponent's actions as a threat.
[02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:11.600]  You can galvanize support for your cause.
[02:43:11.719 --> 02:43:13.899]  They literally are running that playbook.
[02:43:14.020 --> 02:43:17.219]  If you want to know their plans, it's 99.9% of what they use.
[02:43:17.379 --> 02:43:21.440]  And if people can understand that they use these tactics, maybe more people can wake up.
[02:43:22.399 --> 02:43:23.500]  Well, that's right.
[02:43:23.639 --> 02:43:35.719]  And when they say Trump's going to have martial law and send the military to kill citizens, right when Biden puts out an executive order or whoever's controlling him, they already had a coup installing Kamala, and they say there's going to be civil war, and Trump's saying the opposite.
[02:43:35.979 --> 02:43:36.860]  They're telegraphing.
[02:43:36.940 --> 02:43:37.760]  That's their next move.
[02:43:38.879 --> 02:43:39.540]  Boom, there you go.
[02:43:39.680 --> 02:43:41.459]  Again, all you have to do is...
[02:43:41.459 --> 02:43:43.780]  What you've done for many years is...
[02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:48.139]  Tell the people exactly what they're doing by what they're actually saying that they're doing.
[02:43:48.260 --> 02:43:48.780]  It's not hard.
[02:43:48.860 --> 02:43:49.500]  It's not complex.
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:50.540]  It's pretty simple.
[02:43:50.819 --> 02:43:53.420]  It's simplifying it makes it so you can understand it better.
[02:43:53.979 --> 02:43:55.040]  But yeah, that's exactly what they're doing.
[02:43:55.180 --> 02:44:00.479]  And it's unfortunate that what they've done to you and the attack on you, everything they've done is...
[02:44:01.940 --> 02:44:02.579]  It's disgusting.
[02:44:03.079 --> 02:44:04.159]  I guess it's the best word.
[02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:05.700]  No, it is.
[02:44:05.860 --> 02:44:22.399]  And I remember, I only read Rules for Radicals once, like 20 years ago or 30 years ago, but Saul Alinsky pledges it to the first radical, Lucifer, and it's all how to be totally deceptive, how to lie, how to betray people, how to steal, how to just be total scum,
[02:44:22.479 --> 02:44:24.340]  and Hillary and others admit it's their Bible.
[02:44:24.950 --> 02:44:27.469]  It's Obama's Bible, and it's just like, wow!
[02:44:28.170 --> 02:44:32.190]  And the people that buy into this have Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:44:32.409 --> 02:44:34.469]  I mean, why would you love these horrible criminals?
[02:44:35.899 --> 02:44:37.420]  Yeah, I wouldn't.
[02:44:37.500 --> 02:44:37.899]  I don't know.
[02:44:38.079 --> 02:44:44.559]  I mean, I feel bad for people who can't understand that all this stuff they hold onto, their money, their treasure, all this stuff, it's going to be gone.
[02:44:44.700 --> 02:44:52.799]  Like I said, we need to help people like yourself to get us out of this because you're the only person that's actually done something for us other than, like, Musk and all these other people.
[02:44:52.899 --> 02:44:55.920]  I mean, you are a key figure in waking me up.
[02:44:56.100 --> 02:44:57.280]  I always thought something was off.
[02:44:57.440 --> 02:44:58.120]  I appreciate it.
[02:44:58.159 --> 02:45:01.079]  I've been listening to you for many years, like 16, 17 years.
[02:45:01.459 --> 02:45:05.659]  And everything and all the accusations and all the lies, it's just garbage, man.
[02:45:05.860 --> 02:45:06.739]  It's deception.
[02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:08.500]  It's not real.
[02:45:08.819 --> 02:45:15.139]  And if I could ask people out there to actually support somebody like you to get something done, I would recommend it.
[02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:16.559]  Because it's not going to be like this.
[02:45:16.620 --> 02:45:18.420]  If they get in, which they already have what?
[02:45:18.889 --> 02:45:21.049]  Georgia has already turned in a record number of ballots.
[02:45:21.209 --> 02:45:22.149]  I'm concerned, man.
[02:45:22.250 --> 02:45:26.069]  I mean, I know if this wasn't rigged and whatever, then we'd be okay.
[02:45:26.290 --> 02:45:29.149]  But they're not going to give up power.
[02:45:29.790 --> 02:45:35.090]  Because they're literally devil worshippers, but they're being exposed in their fraud.
[02:45:35.409 --> 02:45:36.469]  They've lost the initiative.
[02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:37.829]  We're winning one way or another.
[02:45:38.190 --> 02:45:39.430]  We're winning the hearts and minds.
[02:45:39.569 --> 02:45:40.530]  Thank you so much, Jared.
[02:45:40.670 --> 02:45:41.110]  Stay with us.
[02:45:41.409 --> 02:45:43.309]  The enslavement is happening.
[02:45:43.569 --> 02:45:45.270]  It's unfolding all around us.
[02:45:45.899 --> 02:45:54.420]  We must rise the challenge with God's Spirit filling our sails with the focus and clarity and energy To do the right thing.
[02:45:54.680 --> 02:45:56.899]  Two final callers and the great Drew Hernandez takes over.
[02:45:57.159 --> 02:46:06.479]  But first, the crew put together a little promo from my first emergency broadcast from the emergency studios of the Alex Jones Network.
[02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:09.180]  AlexJones.network.
[02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:10.940]  Tonight, 7 p.m.
[02:46:11.319 --> 02:46:11.340]  Central.
[02:46:11.639 --> 02:46:18.719]  Another emergency transmission as we turn up the heat in the face of the deep state assault.
[02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:23.440]  I don't fight tyranny because I hate the tyrants.
[02:46:24.180 --> 02:46:25.520]  Oh, I do hate them.
[02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:28.879]  I do it because I love the people behind me I'm defending.
[02:46:29.340 --> 02:46:35.120]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:40.399]  I've been holding back my real capabilities.
[02:46:41.139 --> 02:46:43.500]  Almost a shame of a little scary.
[02:46:43.899 --> 02:46:52.770]  I have decided, even just now, accessing the genetic memory codes to release My full potential against the New World War.
[02:46:57.370 --> 02:46:58.870]  Good luck, globalists.
[02:46:59.729 --> 02:47:06.770]  Because if you thought Alex Jones was a problem before, I want you to throw everything you've got in.
[02:47:08.090 --> 02:47:10.309]  Whatever you think it is you need to do.
[02:47:17.909 --> 02:47:20.069]  The fight for the future is now.
[02:47:20.450 --> 02:47:22.530]  Drew Hernandez takes over in a moment.
[02:47:22.829 --> 02:47:25.209]  But first, Eric in New Mexico and then Steve in Arizona.
[02:47:25.430 --> 02:47:26.670]  You're our tail gunners.
[02:47:30.309 --> 02:47:31.030]  Welcome, Eric.
[02:47:32.430 --> 02:47:33.010]  Hey, Alex.
[02:47:34.049 --> 02:47:41.389]  Me and the kids have been doing time capsules and we decided to put like a Bible in it and Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[02:47:41.510 --> 02:47:43.649]  And I was thinking it'd be kind of cool if you sold one.
[02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:51.239]  That had like at least a summary of your archives and stuff, you know, to preserve for the future.
[02:47:51.540 --> 02:47:54.760]  Oh yeah, well the Democrats say that they're going to own all that and ban it all.
[02:47:54.899 --> 02:47:56.200]  Literal digital book burning.
[02:47:56.340 --> 02:47:58.440]  But you guys, my stuff's everywhere.
[02:47:58.860 --> 02:47:59.899]  It's all free to air.
[02:47:59.959 --> 02:48:00.780]  It's always been free.
[02:48:00.899 --> 02:48:01.840]  You've always owned it.
[02:48:01.879 --> 02:48:03.840]  No matter what they say, they'll never be able to block you.
[02:48:05.930 --> 02:48:08.649]  Everybody, whoever's got the capabilities, go download InfoWars.
[02:48:09.049 --> 02:48:10.030]  Upload your own version.
[02:48:10.149 --> 02:48:11.030]  It's free to the public.
[02:48:11.430 --> 02:48:13.790]  All my films, all my material, everything.
[02:48:14.010 --> 02:48:14.629]  It's all yours.
[02:48:15.829 --> 02:48:22.690]  Yeah, it would just be kind of cool for me to, you know, see something like that in your market and buy a timed capsule ready to go, you know?
[02:48:23.270 --> 02:48:24.329]  Well, absolutely.
[02:48:24.889 --> 02:48:26.750]  And that's something that we've been working on.
[02:48:26.889 --> 02:48:28.190]  So, you read my mind.
[02:48:29.209 --> 02:48:29.569]  Oh, wow.
[02:48:29.750 --> 02:48:30.010]  Awesome.
[02:48:30.510 --> 02:48:30.909]  And...
[02:48:31.700 --> 02:48:37.360]  You know, put a Bible in it and put Constitution, Dead Sea Scrolls, whatever you can think of that matters, you know?
[02:48:37.959 --> 02:48:38.819]  That's a great idea.
[02:48:38.959 --> 02:48:43.860]  You know, according to The Globalist, any thought crime in the future is a thought crime in the past.
[02:48:44.100 --> 02:48:50.920]  So something that's not a thought crime today, that is in the future, they'll still ban you or deplatform you or persecute you for it.
[02:48:50.979 --> 02:48:52.139]  So you're talking about a lot of evil stuff.
[02:48:52.239 --> 02:48:53.680]  Alex Jones archives, the Bible.
[02:48:54.299 --> 02:48:57.040]  I mean, this, the Constitution, woo!
[02:48:57.280 --> 02:48:58.979]  The New York Times has banned that thing.
[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:00.100]  Great idea.
[02:49:00.200 --> 02:49:00.739]  Sir, anything else?
[02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:02.360]  No, that's it.
[02:49:02.540 --> 02:49:02.840]  Thank you.
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:03.459]  Love you, brother.
[02:49:03.620 --> 02:49:03.979]  Thank you.
[02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:06.659]  Steve in Arizona, welcome to the airwaves.
[02:49:06.860 --> 02:49:07.200]  Go ahead.
[02:49:08.319 --> 02:49:09.579]  Alex, Alex, hi.
[02:49:10.659 --> 02:49:11.100]  Welcome.
[02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:11.860]  Can you hear me?
[02:49:11.959 --> 02:49:12.500]  I sure can.
[02:49:13.500 --> 02:49:13.860]  Okay.
[02:49:14.260 --> 02:49:15.360]  I'll get to it, Alex.
[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:16.540]  I only got one thing to say.
[02:49:16.719 --> 02:49:20.500]  I wish you would lead us in prayer every hour on the hour.
[02:49:20.659 --> 02:49:22.420]  We've got like 24 days left.
[02:49:22.700 --> 02:49:25.000]  You've got an incredible pool of energy out here.
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:30.120]  15 million people ready to pray for Infowars, for Donald Trump's safety.
[02:49:30.809 --> 02:49:33.530]  For peace in America and a fair election.
[02:49:34.110 --> 02:49:41.909]  If you let us in prayer on bullet point things like that, once an hour or even once every half hour, we can change the world.
[02:49:42.770 --> 02:49:43.950]  What do you think about that?
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:46.079]  Well, prayer is real.
[02:49:46.219 --> 02:49:47.639]  God listens and we pray together.
[02:49:47.819 --> 02:49:49.260]  It's incredibly powerful.
[02:49:49.379 --> 02:49:51.420]  What two of us agree on earth, God makes it so in heaven.
[02:49:51.799 --> 02:49:56.299]  Hernandez is a pastor and a really, really smart guy and I agree with his theological view.
[02:49:56.379 --> 02:49:58.000]  That's my similar understanding of it.
[02:49:58.540 --> 02:49:59.739]  Perhaps he'll lead us in a prayer.
[02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:01.899]  I tend to pray in private.
[02:50:02.100 --> 02:50:09.020]  I have prayed on air some and I tend to pray when everybody's asleep or in the middle of the day when nobody's around.
[02:50:09.760 --> 02:50:12.260]  I really don't ask for stuff from God.
[02:50:12.459 --> 02:50:25.120]  I actually Just try to make contact, which I do, with God, and then ask God what I'm supposed to do so I can be really focused on God and get the discernment of being led God and directed.
[02:50:25.260 --> 02:50:30.280]  So I would pray that God move into people's hearts and minds who are open to it.
[02:50:30.340 --> 02:50:36.000]  I would pray for people to pray, open themselves up to God more in the Holy Spirit, and that God would lead God and direct them.
[02:50:36.500 --> 02:50:38.559]  And I would leave that as people's personal...
[02:50:42.129 --> 02:50:59.270]  I would pray for the children in bondage, both in slave labor and sex slavery worldwide, particularly here because of the globalist operations.
[02:50:59.530 --> 02:51:01.950]  And I would pray that President Trump would focus particularly on that.
[02:51:02.309 --> 02:51:06.969]  And the preparations for martial law, and that the Great Awakening already happening will accelerate.
[02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:13.709]  And I just thank God for seeing the Great Awakening happening that God told me 25 years ago would be happening when the globalists went into their operational mode.
[02:51:13.829 --> 02:51:21.750]  And so all of what God has told me that I've repeated on air decades ago has now come true, proof of how incredible God is and how real.
[02:51:22.699 --> 02:51:30.700]  Thank God for his revelation of John, the revelator on the Isle of Patmos, as we now see it all being fulfilled.
[02:51:30.979 --> 02:51:33.680]  And thank you for your Son, Christ Jesus, and the sacrifices on the cross.
[02:51:34.790 --> 02:51:35.270]  I'm in.
[02:51:35.469 --> 02:51:37.290]  I mean, I just don't know what else to say.
[02:51:37.649 --> 02:51:45.030]  If I was you, I would personally just pray for the Holy Spirit to more intensely come in and to lead God and direct you and have God tell you what God wants you to do.
[02:51:45.510 --> 02:51:47.010]  Drew Hernandez is a great talk show.
[02:51:47.069 --> 02:51:51.430]  He's a really smart guy and also a great reporter and father of a family.
[02:51:51.909 --> 02:52:01.829]  And so, Drew, I don't usually tell you what I want you to do, but if you would indulge the caller and feel the spirit right now to do it, would you lead us in prayer and then get into your segments here on the show?
[02:52:01.829 --> 02:52:02.809]  Thank you so much, Drew Hernandez.
[02:52:04.189 --> 02:52:04.629]  Absolutely.
[02:52:04.909 --> 02:52:09.270]  If the crew would like to maybe just run some video while I pray, that'd be great.
[02:52:09.969 --> 02:52:12.610]  I mean, as a Christian, I'm never going to turn that down.
[02:52:12.809 --> 02:52:17.110]  So right out the gate, Lord Jesus, we just come before you and we're here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:52:17.209 --> 02:52:24.389]  We're here on the Infowars Network on the brink of absolute defeat.
[02:52:24.389 --> 02:52:33.610]  But we know that that has happened many times in your people's history where your back is up against the wall, back is up against the Red Sea, and there's nowhere to go.
[02:52:34.520 --> 02:52:35.180]  But to you.
[02:52:35.440 --> 02:52:41.760]  And so not only do we pray for the future of Infowars, but we pray for the stability of our country in this upcoming election.
[02:52:42.059 --> 02:52:47.600]  We pray for the salvation of souls, not only in the United States of America, but across the entire globe.
[02:52:48.219 --> 02:52:55.059]  Because at the end of the day, everything that is tangible and physical, all of this is going to burn away.
[02:52:55.239 --> 02:52:59.799]  And the only thing that will remain and last forever is your word is you.
[02:53:00.639 --> 02:53:05.110]  And Everything that is preserved by your very word and you yourself.
[02:53:05.549 --> 02:53:14.809]  So we just pray for the salvation of souls here listening today, whether it be on X or Bandot Video or Rumble or wherever my voice is being transmitted through radio.
[02:53:15.010 --> 02:53:28.590]  We just pray that people all around the world that are worried about World War III and total annihilation and devastation of humanity and civilization, we know that the ultimate preservative is you and eternal salvation through your son, Jesus Christ.
[02:53:29.479 --> 02:53:36.420]  And we know that faith in your son Jesus Christ alone is our salvation via repentance and accepting the gospel.
[02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:43.920]  That if we confess Jesus Christ as Lord and believe in our heart that God had raised him from the dead, we shall be saved.
[02:53:44.100 --> 02:53:54.100]  So we pray for that eternal reality in the souls of all people that may hear this right now or maybe missionaries around the entire world that are doing the work of ministry.
[02:53:54.219 --> 02:53:58.520]  Empower them, equip them, encourage them, strengthen them.
[02:53:59.110 --> 02:54:05.809]  Even in the face of martyrdom, we just pray, Lord, for your glory to be revealed in absolutely everything.
[02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:14.389]  Because regardless of what outcomes may be, you are eternal, you are Lord, and you yourself reign forever and will always be good.
[02:54:15.190 --> 02:54:19.549]  And so with that said, we love you regardless of what the outcomes are.
[02:54:19.709 --> 02:54:22.049]  We trust you regardless of what the outcomes are.
[02:54:22.270 --> 02:54:25.709]  But still, faith without works is dead.
[02:54:26.229 --> 02:54:28.430]  This doesn't mean we sit around and do nothing.
[02:54:28.430 --> 02:54:30.229]  So we pray for the energy.
[02:54:30.389 --> 02:54:31.629]  We pray for the resources.
[02:54:31.850 --> 02:54:32.930]  We pray for the guidance.
[02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:34.329]  We pray for the wisdom.
[02:54:34.510 --> 02:54:35.709]  We pray for the discernment.
[02:54:35.889 --> 02:54:41.090]  We pray for the vision to do your work that you've called every single one of us to do.
[02:54:41.290 --> 02:54:52.549]  And at the end of the day, all glory to God, all dominion, all power, all supremacy forever and ever to Christ Jesus our Lord because Christ is eternally King forever.
[02:54:52.829 --> 02:54:54.110]  In Jesus' name, amen.
[02:54:55.250 --> 02:55:02.409]  All right, well, I'll never turn down the opportunity to pray when I'm asked.
[02:55:03.090 --> 02:55:05.750]  We know how Jesus feels about praying in public, etc.
[02:55:06.049 --> 02:55:10.709]  But still, that's why I asked the crew to just play some video because it's not about me.
[02:55:10.770 --> 02:55:11.530]  It's not about Alex.
[02:55:11.690 --> 02:55:13.329]  It's all about Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[02:55:13.610 --> 02:55:29.450]  And sitting there as I'm praying and I'm thinking and The direction of where our nation is going and what I'm seeing is people waking up, which is a great thing, which is a good thing.
[02:55:30.510 --> 02:55:47.549]  But what people need to understand, especially in terms of a biblical worldview and the direction things are going, people really do need to understand that, yes, we do God's will, but that doesn't always mean safety,
[02:55:49.349 --> 02:55:52.309]  And humanistic thinkings of comfort and security.
[02:55:52.510 --> 02:55:54.409]  Now, the Holy Spirit will always comfort us.
[02:55:54.510 --> 02:55:58.329]  What I mean is that God's will, that's what we ultimately pray for.
[02:55:58.469 --> 02:56:01.829]  Lord, may your will be done in Jesus' name, right?
[02:56:01.930 --> 02:56:03.389]  That's the ultimate prayer.
[02:56:04.969 --> 02:56:08.790]  Whatever that outcome is, we gotta be content with that.
[02:56:09.290 --> 02:56:14.969]  And we will continue to worship and follow him regardless of what the outcomes may be.
[02:56:15.680 --> 02:56:20.420]  And just real quick, if the crew can hear me, I don't have a timer.
[02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:21.719]  I can't see a clock.
[02:56:22.219 --> 02:56:26.579]  So I don't know when the next break is and I don't want to awkwardly get cut off.
[02:56:26.680 --> 02:56:32.120]  So if you guys could just let me know in the air piece when we got like 30 seconds left, I'd appreciate that if you guys can hear me.
[02:56:32.719 --> 02:56:49.450]  But continuing, what I am seeing and what I am experiencing is a lot of people waking up, is a lot of people that are coming to the conclusion That what is happening to our nation, what is happening to our world,
[02:56:49.729 --> 02:56:58.629]  goes far beyond political differences, goes far beyond political ideologies, that goes far beyond even cultural issues.
[02:56:59.149 --> 02:57:06.969]  Because obviously there are cultural issues of our diverse world, and I don't use the word diverse in the gay leftist way.
[02:57:07.069 --> 02:57:09.309]  No, we are literally a diverse community.
[02:57:11.250 --> 02:57:11.670]  Culture.
[02:57:11.870 --> 02:57:15.209]  We are literally a diverse planet, civilization.
[02:57:15.969 --> 02:57:18.010]  And with that, you're gonna have all kinds of differences.
[02:57:18.229 --> 02:57:20.629]  With that, you're gonna have all kinds of difference of worldview.
[02:57:20.870 --> 02:57:22.829]  You're gonna have different languages, etc., right?
[02:57:23.389 --> 02:57:39.239]  And so, with that said, you are inevitably going to run into a situation where there is going to be opposing views to the points of war and to the points of Killing, and I'm not calling for that.
[02:57:39.280 --> 02:57:43.239]  I'm just saying this is the nature of fallen humanity without God.
[02:57:44.200 --> 02:57:52.860]  And so what I'm watching happen right now is people are getting to this place where they're identifying, yes, there is a real info war.
[02:57:53.799 --> 02:57:56.559]  Yes, there is a real political war.
[02:57:57.399 --> 02:58:00.500]  Yes, there is a real cultural war.
[02:58:01.489 --> 02:58:06.209]  And yes, when you take a look at the world around you, there is a real scientific war.
[02:58:06.510 --> 02:58:09.809]  There is a real medical tyrannical war.
[02:58:10.590 --> 02:58:13.450]  All of this is very, very real.
[02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:25.229]  And a lot of things that Alex has been teaching us for the past 30 years have all come to pass because they've been in these globalist white papers and writings and they love to talk about it and project about it and predict about it.
[02:58:25.590 --> 02:58:28.430]  Because that's exactly what they're all about is doing.
[02:58:29.779 --> 02:58:31.739]  Implementing, not just talking.
[02:58:32.739 --> 02:58:34.799]  And that's the difference that I find.
[02:58:35.319 --> 02:58:37.680]  I've been a Christian for maybe over 12 years.
[02:58:38.100 --> 02:58:39.280]  I don't keep count.
[02:58:39.799 --> 02:58:43.079]  Just when I think about it, I'm like, wow, it's been that long.
[02:58:44.020 --> 02:58:47.780]  I'm definitely always eternally grateful for my salvation, but...
[02:58:48.530 --> 02:58:53.909]  I try not to do anything that's counting days or I've been X amount of days without this.
[02:58:54.209 --> 02:58:59.969]  I'm not saying that's bad if you've been delivered out of alcoholism or drug addiction or anything like that.
[02:59:00.030 --> 02:59:01.889]  That's great, just for me personally.
[02:59:02.649 --> 02:59:05.090]  Try to not get in a religious mindset.
[02:59:05.950 --> 02:59:23.100]  However, when I look back and I take a look at the State of the church and there's a lot of controversy because a lot of evangelical Christians and I talked about this last week when I was on the Alex Jones show as to why Christians more than 50% may be sitting out these upcoming elections.
[02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:35.079]  There's reasons to that that I think that the Trump campaign has caused that the Harris campaign has kind of leaned into and baited Trump into on the issues of abortion, etc.
[02:59:35.399 --> 02:59:37.120]  Not gonna say that all over again.
[02:59:38.030 --> 02:59:57.850]  But the other side of that coin is just simply weak so-called pastors and beta male so-called pastors and these congregations and these churches that take a look at our world around us and somehow they are told and they are taught not to engage in the world of politics on a spiritual and a biblical level,
[02:59:57.969 --> 03:00:00.309]  which I do not understand and I will never understand.
[03:00:01.170 --> 03:00:05.549]  And in my opinion, I think that is absolutely negligent.
[03:00:06.649 --> 03:00:07.010]  It's weak.
[03:00:07.129 --> 03:00:07.610]  It's coward.
[03:00:08.469 --> 03:00:08.950]  Cowardice.
[03:00:09.090 --> 03:00:12.209]  I mean, I don't understand how you could claim to be born again.
[03:00:12.370 --> 03:00:15.290]  I don't understand how you can claim to be a Christian.
[03:00:15.549 --> 03:00:22.149]  I don't understand how you can claim to be indwelt in housing the most powerful, powerful.
[03:00:23.530 --> 03:00:26.969]  I don't want to use the word force because it demeans the Holy Spirit.
[03:00:28.149 --> 03:00:28.629]  Spirit.
[03:00:28.969 --> 03:00:29.690]  That's appropriate.
[03:00:29.909 --> 03:00:31.350]  The most powerful spirit.
[03:00:31.909 --> 03:00:33.850]  It's God himself, God the Holy Spirit.
[03:00:33.989 --> 03:00:45.510]  How are you claiming to be indwelt with such a power that is eternal, that is undefeated forever, and not engage in your civilization that is falling all around you?
[03:00:45.690 --> 03:00:51.809]  That, I just, as a born-again Christian, I cannot, I will not ever comprehend.
[03:00:51.809 --> 03:00:57.510]  I understand why, but for me, I can't sit there and conclude, yeah, I'm not going to ever fight.
[03:00:58.690 --> 03:01:04.459]  And I'm talking about even when the right wing starts to And compromise on biblical values.
[03:01:04.639 --> 03:01:06.180]  Start to engage that as well.
[03:01:06.260 --> 03:01:07.780]  You don't back down from that.
[03:01:08.219 --> 03:01:09.659]  You expose that too.
[03:01:09.739 --> 03:01:16.719]  It's not just these radical leftist antichrist psychopaths that hate Jesus and that are in opposition towards the Bible.
[03:01:16.819 --> 03:01:18.280]  It's happening in the right wing as well.
[03:01:18.440 --> 03:01:25.280]  And when the right wing throws in the towel and starts to compromise biblical values, you don't back down and let it happen.
[03:01:26.850 --> 03:01:27.850]  Even more so.
[03:01:27.850 --> 03:01:39.409]  That's even more of a wolf in sheep's clothing scenario because a lot of these right-wingers that claim to have biblical values are running around claiming to redefine what it means to be a Christian in the political sphere and world.
[03:01:39.629 --> 03:01:41.690]  You don't just throw the towel in on that.
[03:01:41.829 --> 03:01:43.329]  You don't just let that go.
[03:01:43.590 --> 03:01:49.469]  You don't just let that happen like some beta male, beta female cuck and sit there and just take it.
[03:01:49.930 --> 03:01:51.930]  See, this is what I don't understand about the church.
[03:01:51.930 --> 03:01:52.790]  I really don't.
[03:01:54.129 --> 03:01:55.389]  I don't agree with it.
[03:01:56.250 --> 03:01:57.590]  I don't identify with it.
[03:01:59.149 --> 03:02:04.989]  And I sure, sure, surely don't support it.
[03:02:05.750 --> 03:02:06.670]  Can you tell?
[03:02:07.690 --> 03:02:27.250]  And so I think going into the future, because I've been kind of watching this, particularly the past eight years with the advent of Trump, we've seen a rise of Taking a stance against gay marriage,
[03:02:27.450 --> 03:02:27.569]  right?
[03:02:27.729 --> 03:02:29.930]  Taking a stance against the transhuman agenda, right?
[03:02:30.090 --> 03:02:33.170]  I mean, these are, this is not, it's like, come on, man.
[03:02:33.190 --> 03:02:34.510]  You look at the Bible, it's so simple.
[03:02:34.649 --> 03:02:40.270]  It's literally a kindergartner can sit there and read the Bible through, okay?
[03:02:41.770 --> 03:02:50.690]  And conclude that those are some pretty hallmark pillars of the Christian faith.
[03:02:53.219 --> 03:03:09.760]  So right now when there is a full-scale assault against those things, while your civilization is being hijacked by demonic powers across the entire globe, particularly the United States of America, it's an antichrist system, it's an antichrist machine,
[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:13.219]  it's an antichrist spirit, it's an antichrist agenda.
[03:03:14.469 --> 03:03:30.329]  Now see, this is where I think evangelicals and Christians that somewhat engage in eschatology, which is the study of the end times, particularly in Christian theological circles, because you can have Muslim eschatology, you can have Christian eschatology, you could even have your own eschatology,
[03:03:30.409 --> 03:03:30.549]  right?
[03:03:31.010 --> 03:03:39.870]  But it's the study of the end times, and I am a born-again Christian, so I believe in the biblical eschatology and end times accounts and predictions.
[03:03:40.549 --> 03:03:48.329]  Those that were predicted thousands of years ago that have come to pass and those that have been predicted thousands of years ago that are to come to pass.
[03:03:49.209 --> 03:03:52.569]  God's track record is 100% accurate all the time.
[03:03:53.049 --> 03:04:09.909]  So if you ever get around a man or a woman that claims to be a prophet speaking on behalf of God, making predictions, speaking on behalf of God, and they get it wrong, if they get 99.9% right,
[03:04:10.520 --> 03:04:14.479]  And they get that point percent off, they're a false prophet.
[03:04:14.780 --> 03:04:15.819]  That's not my opinion.
[03:04:16.040 --> 03:04:17.440]  That's the Bible, okay?
[03:04:18.020 --> 03:04:34.000]  And so with that said, as Christ has warned, as the apostles have warned that in these last days, you will see false messiahs, false Christs, false saviors, imposters, false prophets, false teachers, people that are spreading misinformation.
[03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:40.229]  And when I say this word, I don't say it like this current tyrannical Psychotic antichrist government.
[03:04:40.389 --> 03:04:43.610]  I'm talking about real misinformation, real disinformation.
[03:04:43.950 --> 03:04:50.030]  I'm talking about real skewings of the truth and real actual psyops that are being run on the general public.
[03:04:50.309 --> 03:04:52.709]  Is it interesting how they even hijack those terms?
[03:04:53.469 --> 03:05:03.430]  Where when you hear someone like me use the word misinformation or disinformation in the context of where I'm actually warning people about it, you're kind of like, what are you saying, man?
[03:05:03.809 --> 03:05:12.350]  Is it interesting how they've even hijacked terms that Are supposed to be accurately used in accurate contexts?
[03:05:13.290 --> 03:05:15.549]  Yeah, these people are redefining everything.
[03:05:15.709 --> 03:05:17.430]  They're redefining even who God is.
[03:05:18.030 --> 03:05:20.350]  Obviously, they're wrong, and it's blasphemous.
[03:05:20.729 --> 03:05:25.229]  But no man on planet Earth, even Christians, don't have the ability to define who God is.
[03:05:26.329 --> 03:05:27.629]  The Bible defines.
[03:05:27.889 --> 03:05:29.229]  God defines who he is.
[03:05:29.350 --> 03:05:30.649]  God speaks on his own behalf.
[03:05:30.829 --> 03:05:36.510]  We as Christians, we as the church, we interpret his scriptures correctly, right?
[03:05:37.549 --> 03:05:39.729]  We exegete the scripture, not eisegete.
[03:05:39.790 --> 03:05:42.610]  That means you pull out what the Bible is saying for itself.
[03:05:42.610 --> 03:05:45.430]  You don't read into what you think the Bible is saying.
[03:05:47.129 --> 03:05:48.069]  We interpret.
[03:05:48.250 --> 03:05:49.489]  God just speaks for himself.
[03:05:50.670 --> 03:05:54.649]  Same thing with some of his pillars, even in society, such as marriage.
[03:05:55.729 --> 03:06:05.090]  And so as I'm watching this all around me, and I think what happens in the church is the lines get blurred and they get skewed where...
[03:06:05.870 --> 03:06:10.670]  It's almost like I like to call it like a lazy theological mindset.
[03:06:11.790 --> 03:06:13.090]  And it goes like this.
[03:06:13.170 --> 03:06:15.090]  You probably know people like this, right?
[03:06:16.090 --> 03:06:18.309]  Well, Jesus Christ is coming back anyways.
[03:06:19.270 --> 03:06:21.110]  I mean, take a look at the world around you.
[03:06:21.229 --> 03:06:22.149]  Matthew 24.
[03:06:22.569 --> 03:06:24.309]  I mean, look at 1 and 2 Timothy.
[03:06:24.569 --> 03:06:27.690]  I mean, the Apostle Paul warned exactly about these days.
[03:06:27.850 --> 03:06:28.750]  Romans chapter 1.
[03:06:28.870 --> 03:06:29.889]  It's like reading the newspaper.
[03:06:30.069 --> 03:06:34.770]  It's like opening up Infowars.com and reading the front page of the breaking news.
[03:06:36.899 --> 03:06:37.940]  Yeah, agree.
[03:06:39.020 --> 03:06:46.639]  But this is where I don't agree, is they will go right there and they'll say everything correctly.
[03:06:46.780 --> 03:06:55.079]  Jesus said this, Jesus said that, look at the last days here, look at the last days there, look at the Middle East, look at these possible developing prophecies that might unfold.
[03:06:55.920 --> 03:07:00.579]  So enjoy the show.
[03:07:01.719 --> 03:07:02.159]  Brother?
[03:07:02.159 --> 03:07:03.139]  You know what I mean?
[03:07:03.760 --> 03:07:06.100]  Enjoy the show, Brother Drew.
[03:07:06.299 --> 03:07:06.819]  You know what I mean?
[03:07:06.920 --> 03:07:08.020]  It's like, what do you mean?
[03:07:08.940 --> 03:07:10.440]  I've literally been told this.
[03:07:11.139 --> 03:07:12.639]  So what are you implying?
[03:07:12.760 --> 03:07:13.579]  Well, enjoy the show.
[03:07:13.719 --> 03:07:16.559]  Jesus is probably gonna come back within the next 20 years.
[03:07:16.870 --> 03:07:23.469]  A lot of weak-minded, I think misdirected boomers think this way because they're kind of at the end of their lifetime.
[03:07:23.709 --> 03:07:27.149]  And yes, things are as the Bible described in the last days.
[03:07:27.290 --> 03:07:34.530]  And I could get how you get into this mindset where, yeah, you got like 20 years left to live and you think that Jesus Christ could return at any moment, which he can.
[03:07:34.850 --> 03:07:36.469]  But, you know, I'm going to die anyway.
[03:07:36.750 --> 03:07:39.629]  So just chill out, young man, and enjoy the show.
[03:07:40.430 --> 03:07:41.129]  I can see it.
[03:07:41.190 --> 03:07:41.450]  Thank you.
[03:07:43.750 --> 03:07:44.110]  No.
[03:07:45.059 --> 03:07:46.620]  No man knows the day or the hour.
[03:07:46.899 --> 03:07:49.200]  We could be here for another 500 years fighting.
[03:07:50.139 --> 03:07:51.360]  So I disagree with that.
[03:07:51.780 --> 03:07:52.500]  We'll be right back.
[03:07:53.059 --> 03:07:53.899]  Make sure to share the links.
[03:07:54.440 --> 03:08:03.840]  Irish sea moss has been all the rage in the last five years because when folks started discovering it, it took the country and the world by storm because of the incredible effects it has.
[03:08:04.059 --> 03:08:06.399]  It's probably the greatest superfood out there.
[03:08:06.840 --> 03:08:10.559]  Full of organic-based iodine and a whole bunch of vitamins and minerals.

[03:08:52.620 --> 03:08:53.340]  Now, thanks for the support.
[03:08:54.280 --> 03:08:59.520]  All righty, you are now watching the fourth hour of The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:59.940 --> 03:09:02.299]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:02.540 --> 03:09:04.299]  We gotta make that a thing, don't we?
[03:09:04.520 --> 03:09:07.319]  We gotta find a way to create, I just had this idea.
[03:09:07.520 --> 03:09:12.319]  We gotta find a way to create some kind of campaign where you just say Alex Jones' name.
[03:09:12.959 --> 03:09:13.319]  Right?
[03:09:13.520 --> 03:09:25.899]  Because they're not only trying to hijack the man's name, it's hijacking the man's identity to the point where you can't start your own new thing because your name is so powerful and popular.
[03:09:26.340 --> 03:09:31.000]  It's synonymous obviously with Infowars, but it's always going to succeed.
[03:09:31.739 --> 03:09:32.260]  I don't know.
[03:09:32.360 --> 03:09:38.620]  Maybe we could start some kind of social media campaign where you just like, it's like, say his name, Alex Jones, say his name.
[03:09:38.719 --> 03:09:39.159]  I don't know.
[03:09:39.600 --> 03:09:41.680]  Something around those lines.
[03:09:41.819 --> 03:09:42.100]  I don't know.
[03:09:42.420 --> 03:09:44.520]  Chase Geyser is better than me at the meme thing.
[03:09:44.639 --> 03:09:46.299]  So maybe you could figure something like that out.
[03:09:46.420 --> 03:09:47.860]  But just an idea.
[03:09:48.040 --> 03:09:50.500]  But with that said, you guys got to support the broadcast.
[03:09:50.700 --> 03:09:55.659]  I'm telling you right now, go to thealexjonesstore.com, thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:09:55.799 --> 03:09:59.200]  With a full-scale assault against Infowars.
[03:09:59.719 --> 03:10:01.000]  Just got the confirmation.
[03:10:01.319 --> 03:10:09.219]  I got my black and red Infowars classic OG. OG classic Infowars logo t-shirt.
[03:10:09.319 --> 03:10:10.600]  So I'm excited about that.
[03:10:10.840 --> 03:10:14.059]  Right when that thing comes in, I'm going to wear that everywhere.
[03:10:14.440 --> 03:10:16.680]  So make sure you get yours because that thing is a relic.
[03:10:17.049 --> 03:10:24.649]  That thing will go down into the past when World War III and the nuclear holocaust literally is unleashed all over the place.
[03:10:24.889 --> 03:10:36.110]  And it's like straight up Terminator salvation into the future war and it's total annihilation everywhere, nuclear fallout, post-nuclear apocalyptic scenario.
[03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:37.909]  You'll see two things.
[03:10:38.229 --> 03:10:40.889]  You will see an American flag posted somewhere.
[03:10:44.149 --> 03:10:46.790]  It will still be somewhere and you will see.
[03:10:52.690 --> 03:10:56.090]  We're good to go.
[03:11:17.549 --> 03:11:18.709]  This brings me to this.
[03:11:19.870 --> 03:11:24.930]  If you actually think about it, all of our efforts are never in vain, right?
[03:11:24.989 --> 03:11:26.190]  The Bible makes that very clear.
[03:11:26.309 --> 03:11:29.750]  You do good, you do good, and your works will never be in vain.
[03:11:29.809 --> 03:11:31.670]  It's not that you do good to be saved.
[03:11:32.250 --> 03:11:34.870]  It's your good works as a born-again Christian.
[03:11:35.049 --> 03:11:37.569]  I mean, that's God has created us, right?
[03:11:37.649 --> 03:11:40.909]  We are his workmanship created for good works that we should walk in them.
[03:11:40.989 --> 03:11:42.170]  That's after salvation.
[03:11:42.850 --> 03:11:43.969]  God uses us.
[03:11:45.049 --> 03:11:49.590]  For his own will, for his own purposes, and for his righteousness sake.
[03:11:49.829 --> 03:11:52.250]  That has an effect on planet Earth.
[03:11:52.389 --> 03:11:54.969]  That has an effect on the world around us.
[03:11:55.229 --> 03:11:56.729]  Now, we don't know the day or the hour.
[03:11:56.809 --> 03:11:58.270]  We don't know when this is all gonna end.
[03:11:58.370 --> 03:12:02.010]  We don't know when the end finally comes.
[03:12:02.819 --> 03:12:06.819]  Well, all I know is that the Bible calls me to fight this righteous right of faith.
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:09.879]  The Bible calls me to fight the good fight of faith.
[03:12:10.040 --> 03:12:14.239]  The Bible calls me to be obedient to Christ regardless if it's convenient or inconvenient.
[03:12:14.500 --> 03:12:18.360]  I know that the Bible calls me to follow Christ in all circumstances.
[03:12:19.899 --> 03:12:32.989]  So even if I knew that Jesus Christ was coming in five minutes, if I just somehow knew that, not claiming I know that, I'm just saying if I hypothetically somehow knew that, I'm not sitting around chilling out.
[03:12:34.370 --> 03:12:38.450]  I am actually taking it into high gear.
[03:12:39.649 --> 03:12:57.629]  Because if I got five minutes left to preach this gospel and reach and pull people out of this satanic kingdom of darkness matrix simulation, if all I got is five minutes left to go, then I'm going to make the most of those five minutes because you want to know what?
[03:12:58.930 --> 03:13:01.229]  I believe that Christ Jesus would expect me to do that.
[03:13:02.270 --> 03:13:10.850]  As a born again Christian, as his son, as someone that has been saved and plucked out of that same kingdom of darkness, I don't take my salvation for granted.
[03:13:11.790 --> 03:13:18.930]  And whether I have five minutes, or whether I have five days, or five weeks, or five months, or five years, or 500 years.
[03:13:19.030 --> 03:13:22.049]  And I'm not saying this to virtue segment like, Drew, you're such a strong Christian.
[03:13:22.129 --> 03:13:23.190]  I'm just being completely honest.
[03:13:23.309 --> 03:13:24.270]  This is how I feel.
[03:13:25.559 --> 03:13:27.680]  And I don't understand how people don't feel this as well.
[03:13:27.959 --> 03:13:29.920]  And it is devastating.
[03:13:30.100 --> 03:13:31.180]  It's looking bad out there.
[03:13:31.659 --> 03:13:41.620]  All the news that Alex just covered about the EU, going after Elon Musk, going after his companies, the ultimate end game is what Alex is experiencing now.
[03:13:41.899 --> 03:13:44.340]  It's the total hijack of your identity entirely.
[03:13:45.059 --> 03:13:57.040]  And I think once AI and artificial intelligence Becomes more of a weaponized reality, right?
[03:13:57.139 --> 03:14:03.239]  Because all technology, especially now in this modern age, like pre-World War II, I mean, you can argue before, right?
[03:14:03.299 --> 03:14:06.079]  This has been happening, but let's just start there, right?
[03:14:06.500 --> 03:14:17.219]  Excuse me, post-World War II. All of this advent and technological boost, most of technology, especially digitally, is being weaponized against humanity, civilization.
[03:14:17.219 --> 03:14:19.340]  That makes sense to me from a biblical perspective.
[03:14:20.989 --> 03:14:28.809]  Demonic legions, Lucifer, Satan, this Antichrist system will be used against civilization in the end.
[03:14:29.430 --> 03:14:36.190]  I truly believe, this is just my opinion, that the mark of the beast will be some type of technological advancement.
[03:14:37.610 --> 03:14:40.370]  That's just my opinion, biblical opinion.
[03:14:41.309 --> 03:14:44.870]  And so with that said, and that doesn't mean that technologically itself is evil.
[03:14:45.030 --> 03:14:46.229]  Technology is great.
[03:14:46.350 --> 03:14:47.829]  Technology could be used for good.
[03:14:48.090 --> 03:14:50.110]  Technology could be used for the kingdom of heaven.
[03:14:50.290 --> 03:14:53.950]  But at the same time, technology can be used for the kingdom of darkness.
[03:14:55.049 --> 03:14:59.309]  And so with that said, yes, that's the ultimate endgame.
[03:14:59.469 --> 03:15:03.790]  They want to completely take you of your identity.
[03:15:03.969 --> 03:15:12.270]  Listen, if they can't kill you, if they can't bankrupt you, if they can't slander you, And discredit you.
[03:15:13.450 --> 03:15:19.870]  Alex Jones really is the model of where this goes, right?
[03:15:20.149 --> 03:15:24.290]  I think they're too afraid to assassinate someone like Alex Jones.
[03:15:24.510 --> 03:15:25.149]  Now, God forbid.
[03:15:25.389 --> 03:15:26.590]  I pray against this all the time.
[03:15:26.670 --> 03:15:29.129]  Same for Donald Trump and everybody involved.
[03:15:29.270 --> 03:15:32.770]  This is not just the guys behind the microphone, okay?
[03:15:32.989 --> 03:15:38.270]  And if you saw what happened after January 6th of 2021, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[03:15:38.829 --> 03:15:40.049]  Everybody's on a damn list.
[03:15:46.160 --> 03:15:46.720]  Everybody!
[03:15:46.720 --> 03:15:48.840]  You know what's an interesting case?
[03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:50.559]  What's her name from the Young Turks?
[03:15:50.840 --> 03:15:52.500]  Anna Kerespian?
[03:15:52.639 --> 03:15:53.379]  Did I pronounce that right?
[03:15:53.459 --> 03:15:54.000]  I forget.
[03:15:54.260 --> 03:15:54.579]  I forget.
[03:15:54.979 --> 03:15:56.120]  I mean, I don't watch the Young Turks.
[03:15:57.799 --> 03:16:07.639]  Watching her kind of get red-pilled and detach herself from the radical left because she's kind of realized how psychotic they are.
[03:16:08.940 --> 03:16:10.020]  When she...
[03:16:12.049 --> 03:16:23.430]  I think she was walking somewhere outside of her apartment or her house in the street and she got sexually assaulted by a male and decided to go public and talk about it.
[03:16:24.069 --> 03:16:38.850]  And immediately, Immediately, her followers, her own cult following, all of these psycho leftists immediately turned it on her and said, what you're saying is actually going to damage those that are marginalized.
[03:16:39.889 --> 03:16:41.209]  Marginalized communities.
[03:16:42.850 --> 03:16:45.030]  Meaning blacks or browns or whatever.
[03:16:45.250 --> 03:16:47.790]  And she didn't even mention the race of her attacker.
[03:16:48.409 --> 03:16:52.770]  And it turned out her attacker was white and it totally just threw her off.
[03:16:53.790 --> 03:16:55.670]  And I was reading her piece.
[03:16:56.629 --> 03:17:02.229]  When she put this out, it went super viral, and she said she just couldn't believe that.
[03:17:02.329 --> 03:17:03.569]  I'm paraphrasing, right?
[03:17:03.649 --> 03:17:17.129]  This is what I got from it, that she just was stunned that her side took it to that extreme without any facts and turned it around on her without even knowing the situation.
[03:17:17.450 --> 03:17:23.690]  And I use that as an example is because that is a cult.
[03:17:23.950 --> 03:17:25.430]  You are in a cult.
[03:17:25.649 --> 03:17:25.870]  Ha!
[03:17:27.149 --> 03:17:28.969]  That's what's happening to a lot of people.
[03:17:29.129 --> 03:17:31.149]  Look at the red pilling of Elon Musk.
[03:17:31.270 --> 03:17:33.409]  Elon Musk is on his way, right?
[03:17:33.670 --> 03:17:36.049]  Look at the red pilling of Joe Rogan.
[03:17:36.170 --> 03:17:38.370]  Joe Rogan's on his own journey, right?
[03:17:39.110 --> 03:17:42.850]  A lot of these guys are dealing with this tyranny.
[03:17:42.989 --> 03:17:44.809]  They're dealing with this federal government.
[03:17:44.950 --> 03:17:49.229]  They're dealing with this on a personal level, on a personal basis.
[03:17:50.090 --> 03:18:03.069]  And see, unfortunately, That's what it takes in order to wake you up because you're sitting on the sidelines and you're watching the destruction of Infowars and Alex Jones and the depersoning, the debanking and the deplatforming.
[03:18:03.309 --> 03:18:09.729]  And you're watching all this from the sidelines and you think to yourself, well, gee, as long as I don't go where he went, I'll be okay.
[03:18:09.930 --> 03:18:10.250]  Wrong!
[03:18:12.590 --> 03:18:14.129]  Because you're dealing with a cult.
[03:18:15.350 --> 03:18:18.149]  And in a cult, you don't have any options.
[03:18:18.149 --> 03:18:19.209]  You don't have a choice.
[03:18:20.030 --> 03:18:21.129]  You are told what to believe.
[03:18:21.129 --> 03:18:22.309]  You are told what to say.
[03:18:22.430 --> 03:18:23.469]  You are told what to read.
[03:18:23.670 --> 03:18:25.110]  You are told what to listen to.
[03:18:25.350 --> 03:18:26.690]  You are told how to react.
[03:18:26.989 --> 03:18:28.270]  You are told how to live.
[03:18:28.549 --> 03:18:35.309]  You are told how to breathe and when to breathe and what to eat and when not to eat, when to drink and what not to drink, the Kool-Aid or not.
[03:18:36.729 --> 03:18:38.510]  You do not have a choice.
[03:18:39.170 --> 03:18:43.569]  I think that is part of the big great awakening that's taking place right now.
[03:18:44.450 --> 03:18:48.530]  Because I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I don't fully trust Elon Musk.
[03:18:48.989 --> 03:18:52.610]  I've just been watching this guy and I'm like, dude, this guy is on a journey, man.
[03:18:53.850 --> 03:19:01.829]  It is very much a net positive to have Elon Musk where he is right now.
[03:19:02.670 --> 03:19:05.530]  And we want him to go further, right?
[03:19:06.709 --> 03:19:10.110]  Someone like Elon Musk receives the gospel and is born again.
[03:19:10.229 --> 03:19:11.069]  That's where we need him.
[03:19:11.649 --> 03:19:12.809]  But he's on his journey.
[03:19:13.770 --> 03:19:17.469]  And we are seeing, we are gaining ground big time.
[03:19:18.549 --> 03:19:28.450]  We are gaining ground big time in the culture, gaining ground big time in a lot of these influential institutions that have been hijacked.
[03:19:28.729 --> 03:19:33.350]  But the reason why that's happening is because people are doing the work.
[03:19:33.790 --> 03:19:44.090]  People are pushing back peacefully, legislatively, intellectually, educationally, culturally, technologically, right?
[03:19:44.829 --> 03:19:52.649]  Whatever sphere you find yourself, whatever career path or influence you find yourself, that's where you do the work.
[03:19:53.530 --> 03:19:58.649]  And the ones that are going to do the heavy lifting, obviously, we've seen Alex Jones doing this.
[03:19:59.010 --> 03:20:00.950]  We've seen Donald Trump doing this.
[03:20:01.190 --> 03:20:02.709]  We've seen people like Roger Stone.
[03:20:02.889 --> 03:20:08.170]  We've seen everyone that has been particularly getting hit hard in the past eight years.
[03:20:08.290 --> 03:20:10.530]  But Alex has been dealing with this for decades, right?
[03:20:10.709 --> 03:20:11.510]  And for wars itself.
[03:20:14.680 --> 03:20:20.280]  But however, there's no sitting on the sidelines watching anymore.
[03:20:21.120 --> 03:20:27.920]  And I think people understand that and a lot of very influential people are understanding that.
[03:20:28.440 --> 03:20:41.440]  Which by the way, this is why there's some crisis within the Harris campaign because if you pay attention to what they're saying, MSNBC, when they first started to call on Kamala Harris to come out of hiding and do some interviews.
[03:20:42.639 --> 03:20:44.979]  Because her internal polling was looking terrible.
[03:20:45.239 --> 03:20:47.500]  It was literally just falling, falling, falling.
[03:20:47.600 --> 03:20:55.440]  She's doing horrible with men, black men particularly, Latino men particularly, and another demographic she's not doing well with.
[03:20:55.500 --> 03:20:58.079]  I think this is why Mark Cuban is now campaigning for her.
[03:20:58.799 --> 03:21:02.340]  Isn't he doing his first rally with her today or tomorrow, right?
[03:21:02.520 --> 03:21:03.360]  That'll be hilarious.
[03:21:03.440 --> 03:21:04.260]  That guy can't talk.
[03:21:04.500 --> 03:21:07.020]  That guy has the worst political takes.
[03:21:07.579 --> 03:21:10.020]  Mark Cuban is smart, smart businessman.
[03:21:10.959 --> 03:21:13.840]  Would love to know what the skeletons are in that guy's closet.
[03:21:15.819 --> 03:21:19.659]  But, dude, when it comes to politics, you're a train wreck, dude.
[03:21:20.260 --> 03:21:26.379]  But anyways, part of the demographic she's not doing well with is business owners.
[03:21:27.500 --> 03:21:28.100]  Right?
[03:21:28.940 --> 03:21:29.540]  Entrepreneurs.
[03:21:31.180 --> 03:21:39.020]  People that are actually paying attention to her economic policies that will make a major, major impact.
[03:21:39.989 --> 03:21:42.649]  If you are a business owner, right?
[03:21:43.889 --> 03:21:46.430]  And you saw MSNBC all complaining about this.
[03:21:46.510 --> 03:21:48.149]  They were literally saying this on the air.
[03:21:48.209 --> 03:21:53.950]  And that's what I believe led her to the media blitz and led her to the downfall of this last interview on Fox News last night.
[03:21:54.270 --> 03:21:59.090]  Which is just like inevitable, not surprising, but that's what you're going to get with Kamala Harris, right?
[03:22:00.629 --> 03:22:01.030]  Right?
[03:22:02.409 --> 03:22:04.809]  You order a cheeseburger, you're going to get a cheeseburger.
[03:22:06.720 --> 03:22:09.440]  That's what the Democrats ordered and that's what they're gonna get.
[03:22:09.600 --> 03:22:10.920]  That's what you got, right?
[03:22:11.280 --> 03:22:12.680]  And it's so crazy.
[03:22:13.120 --> 03:22:18.780]  Dude, I was watching that clip last night of Joe Biden and Obama in that church.
[03:22:19.559 --> 03:22:22.799]  I was watching that clip over, I don't know, maybe you guys were too.
[03:22:22.899 --> 03:22:23.540]  I know I was.
[03:22:23.600 --> 03:22:26.719]  I was watching it over and, oh, what are they saying?
[03:22:26.860 --> 03:22:27.659]  Oh my gosh.
[03:22:27.959 --> 03:22:31.059]  If we could obtain that audio, I wish I was a lip reader.
[03:22:32.059 --> 03:22:42.399]  But I will tell you, because the New York Post came out, With an expert that's involved with law enforcement as well, with lip reading, came out and said that Biden just straight up told Obama, yeah, she's not as strong as me.
[03:22:43.559 --> 03:22:45.559]  And Obama said, I know, right?
[03:22:45.920 --> 03:22:46.360]  Allegedly.
[03:22:48.059 --> 03:22:54.459]  But even without knowing what was being said out of Obama's mouth, especially, it was strange.
[03:22:54.459 --> 03:22:57.360]  You look at that video, and I'm being completely honest here.
[03:22:57.379 --> 03:22:58.879]  I was watching that last night.
[03:22:58.879 --> 03:23:04.000]  I was even showing it to my wife, and she's like, yeah, Obama looks pissed, right?
[03:23:04.790 --> 03:23:05.950]  He's like, Obama looks pissed.
[03:23:06.069 --> 03:23:09.049]  He gives some kind of backhanded comment.
[03:23:09.209 --> 03:23:10.129]  You can totally see it.
[03:23:10.129 --> 03:23:11.229]  It's written all over his face.
[03:23:11.450 --> 03:23:14.889]  A total, passive, aggressive, backhanded comment.
[03:23:15.930 --> 03:23:17.170]  I know that look.
[03:23:17.930 --> 03:23:18.489]  Right?
[03:23:20.030 --> 03:23:26.270]  But what's interesting was, didn't Biden look somewhat coherent and cognitive in that conversation?
[03:23:26.729 --> 03:23:28.370]  It was weird, dude.
[03:23:28.569 --> 03:23:29.450]  I was watching that.
[03:23:29.510 --> 03:23:31.750]  I've been watching it all night last night.
[03:23:32.719 --> 03:23:33.860]  I'm looking at Joe Biden.
[03:23:33.959 --> 03:23:36.299]  I'm like, dude, he looks cognitive.
[03:23:36.620 --> 03:23:41.219]  He looks like he's fully understanding what Obama is saying to him.
[03:23:41.739 --> 03:23:43.319]  It was a strange moment.
[03:23:43.500 --> 03:23:44.559]  But you want to know what?
[03:23:45.840 --> 03:23:46.319]  Panic.
[03:23:47.799 --> 03:23:52.680]  And the verge of failure and destruction is sobering.
[03:23:53.780 --> 03:23:56.200]  And I think that is what is happening currently.
[03:23:56.379 --> 03:24:01.340]  If you are Barack Obama right now, if you are Joe Biden, if you're Joe Biden, you're like, hmm.
[03:24:02.500 --> 03:24:05.180]  Yeah, she's not as strong as me.
[03:24:06.420 --> 03:24:08.219]  I know, right?
[03:24:08.940 --> 03:24:16.739]  And to be completely honest with you, we know that Biden is a train wreck and his polling numbers were horrible.
[03:24:17.479 --> 03:24:20.979]  But he might have actually done a little better running.
[03:24:21.579 --> 03:24:23.559]  Oh, it would have been hilarious, right?
[03:24:23.559 --> 03:24:24.420]  It would have been a blowout.
[03:24:24.620 --> 03:24:26.940]  Either way, the riggers are going to try to rig this damn thing, right?
[03:24:27.040 --> 03:24:28.879]  Or just refuse to certify the election.
[03:24:28.899 --> 03:24:30.040]  That's where I think it's going.
[03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:34.790]  Honestly, I think Biden would have done better in Pennsylvania.
[03:24:35.010 --> 03:24:36.170]  She is struggling.
[03:24:37.129 --> 03:24:41.430]  Have you guys seen the new recent reports of internal Harris campaign operatives?
[03:24:41.729 --> 03:24:42.809]  They're all complaining.
[03:24:42.950 --> 03:24:48.010]  They're all fighting with each other, particularly in Pennsylvania, because she has campaign managers in Pennsylvania.
[03:24:49.569 --> 03:24:51.530]  They're complaining they don't know what she's doing.
[03:24:51.729 --> 03:25:01.090]  It's like, yeah, that's what happens, dude, when you roll out this DEI inclusive nonsense where everybody gets appointed because of the color of their skin or their sexual orientation.
[03:25:01.559 --> 03:25:02.000]  Right?
[03:25:04.120 --> 03:25:06.100]  Nobody is there because of their capabilities.
[03:25:06.340 --> 03:25:07.680]  Well, now you're going to suffer from that.
[03:25:07.799 --> 03:25:10.020]  Now you're going to experience the consequences of that.
[03:25:10.780 --> 03:25:19.200]  However, I think that's what is beginning to set in, not only in the mainstream media, but within the Harris campaign.
[03:25:19.379 --> 03:25:20.479]  Obama looks pissed.
[03:25:22.139 --> 03:25:24.399]  You want to know why else I think Obama's pissed?
[03:25:24.680 --> 03:25:27.180]  Because not even he is able to save Kamala Harris.
[03:25:27.379 --> 03:25:31.000]  Not even he is able to sell Kamala Harris.
[03:25:31.139 --> 03:25:36.680]  The fact that Barack Obama cannot sell Kamala Harris to black men is so insane, dude.
[03:25:37.459 --> 03:25:40.100]  Like, if you really think about that, right?
[03:25:40.299 --> 03:25:41.959]  Like, bro, you got guys like Lord Jamal.
[03:25:42.059 --> 03:25:42.860]  Have you seen the interview?
[03:25:43.239 --> 03:25:43.819]  Oh my gosh.
[03:25:43.940 --> 03:25:50.500]  If you have not seen that guy's interview, he's like a super old school 90s OG rapper.
[03:25:50.780 --> 03:25:51.340]  Lord Jamal.
[03:25:51.440 --> 03:25:52.899]  Is it Jamar or Jamal?
[03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:54.079]  I think it's Jamar, right?
[03:25:54.879 --> 03:25:55.659]  Look it up, dude.
[03:25:55.860 --> 03:26:00.100]  It's probably one of the best interviews I've seen this entire election cycle.
[03:26:00.239 --> 03:26:01.420]  He just obliterates.
[03:26:01.579 --> 03:26:08.120]  This black dude obliterates and unpacks, de-masks Kamala Harris and Obama and Democrats.
[03:26:08.299 --> 03:26:08.680]  It's great.
[03:26:08.799 --> 03:26:09.500]  It's where we need to be.
[03:26:09.579 --> 03:26:10.559]  But again, that's what I'm saying.
[03:26:11.040 --> 03:26:14.600]  There are people waking up, but we don't stop.
[03:26:15.879 --> 03:26:16.979]  We don't stop.
[03:26:18.120 --> 03:26:20.799]  Because you begin to let up.
[03:26:21.639 --> 03:26:30.299]  That means that you are giving up critical ground that we have gained in the culture, in politics, legislatively, in the media, etc.
[03:26:31.399 --> 03:26:31.840]  Right?
[03:26:32.399 --> 03:26:36.440]  Look at the gains that Band.Video obviously Infowars has made.
[03:26:37.340 --> 03:26:38.840]  Look at the gains that Rumble.
[03:26:39.379 --> 03:26:41.000]  Now look at X. Right?
[03:26:41.100 --> 03:26:41.620]  Look at Gab.
[03:26:41.860 --> 03:26:46.879]  Look at all these independent platforms that are now growing and exploding.
[03:26:47.219 --> 03:26:48.280]  You take a look at Kik.
[03:26:48.420 --> 03:26:49.020]  Kik is huge.
[03:26:49.159 --> 03:26:50.899]  Kik is not the biggest...
[03:26:52.000 --> 03:27:01.020]  Free speech platform, but there's a lot of Zoomers on Kik, and that's a pretty big platform right there, an alternative to Twitch, right?
[03:27:01.620 --> 03:27:04.479]  And so there is this resurgency.
[03:27:04.719 --> 03:27:14.959]  There is this awakening with independent media, talk show hosts, shows themselves, news, culture, commentary, opinion, right?
[03:27:15.079 --> 03:27:16.639]  There is this resurgency.
[03:27:16.639 --> 03:27:17.639]  It's had an effect.
[03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:25.239]  And also within government, we've had some America first congressmen, congresswomen, senators.
[03:27:25.500 --> 03:27:30.000]  I mean, Donald Trump is literally the front man of this movement, you could literally argue, right?
[03:27:30.860 --> 03:27:31.840]  He's changed things.
[03:27:32.000 --> 03:27:39.020]  I think Patrick Beck David just straight up told Trump in his interview today, you killed the mainstream media.
[03:27:39.239 --> 03:27:40.219]  I think that's what he said.
[03:27:40.360 --> 03:27:42.860]  Something like, you literally killed or destroyed the mainstream.
[03:27:42.959 --> 03:27:43.799]  It's true, and it's true.
[03:27:44.969 --> 03:27:50.090]  And a lot of people have followed that, but Alex Jones has been on that trajectory for a while.
[03:27:51.190 --> 03:27:54.729]  However, it's leading me to where we are now, currently.
[03:27:55.729 --> 03:28:10.989]  And when I see a pissed-off Barack Obama, an irritated Barack Obama, where Barack Obama himself, the Democrat Party, the Black Messiah, their golden calf, the first black president of the United States,
[03:28:11.010 --> 03:28:16.940]  according to their definition, That is their God, right?
[03:28:17.159 --> 03:28:28.299]  The fact that their God cannot sell Kamala Harris to black people is going to lead them into a direction.
[03:28:28.459 --> 03:28:41.520]  And this brings me to what Alex was talking about before he passed the baton to me, is yes, you are seeing the Biden administration, the DOD, move in a direction, mobilizing.
[03:28:42.290 --> 03:28:44.090]  The military preparing the military.
[03:28:44.329 --> 03:28:53.510]  We saw just a couple weeks ago that Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray held a press conference getting ready, priming the masses.
[03:28:54.770 --> 03:28:57.149]  Remember when they came out and they threw Tenet under the bus?
[03:28:57.969 --> 03:29:02.770]  And in that press conference, they said, well, they literally just used Tenet as a fall guy.
[03:29:02.889 --> 03:29:03.270]  That's it.
[03:29:03.370 --> 03:29:03.870]  You know what I mean?
[03:29:05.809 --> 03:29:13.559]  And In that press conference, they said, well, you know, Russia's already attempting to interfere and meddle in this election.
[03:29:14.059 --> 03:29:20.760]  They're already, we got Russia, we got China, they're already trying to psyop Trump into believing that Iran is actually trying to kill him.
[03:29:20.879 --> 03:29:21.760]  Like, give me a break, dude.
[03:29:21.879 --> 03:29:22.180]  Come on.
[03:29:22.479 --> 03:29:22.780]  Come on.
[03:29:23.159 --> 03:29:23.360]  Right?
[03:29:25.180 --> 03:29:42.850]  And so we have these movements where They are moving in this direction and just me personally, I've been saying this for like the past two years that they'll probably just straight up let Trump win and then refuse to certify the election and then any retaliation peaceful,
[03:29:43.010 --> 03:29:44.690]  peaceful protest, right?
[03:29:46.030 --> 03:29:57.030]  Or response to the election, which I think is going to be a lot bigger if they actually steal this thing and they refuse to certify the election.
[03:29:57.680 --> 03:30:04.319]  I think the response is going to be a lot bigger than it was on January 6th.
[03:30:04.659 --> 03:30:12.399]  And not just because we're in the middle of these mass lockdowns and COVID freakout, right?
[03:30:12.819 --> 03:30:14.819]  And I'm not talking in terms of violence.
[03:30:14.819 --> 03:30:17.020]  I'm not talking in terms of acts of violence.
[03:30:20.149 --> 03:30:22.989]  Physical destruction of property or anything like that.
[03:30:23.069 --> 03:30:27.209]  What I'm saying is there has been a shift and a change.
[03:30:27.549 --> 03:30:32.770]  There's a lot more people that are not trusting what this government is doing.
[03:30:33.209 --> 03:30:40.450]  There's a lot more people that I think if they see another steal, especially right now, right?
[03:30:40.709 --> 03:30:47.729]  With Kamala just completely tanking, you see Barack Obama looking pissed off talking to Joe Biden in a church.
[03:30:47.909 --> 03:30:48.809]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:30:50.379 --> 03:30:52.899]  Nobody likes Kamala Harris.
[03:30:54.879 --> 03:31:01.620]  Dude, nobody believes that Kamala Harris is more popular than Donald Trump, dude.
[03:31:03.239 --> 03:31:07.899]  All politics aside, all politics aside, okay?
[03:31:08.260 --> 03:31:10.200]  Set aside your political opinions.
[03:31:10.559 --> 03:31:14.299]  Set aside policy opinions, differences.
[03:31:14.680 --> 03:31:15.500]  Set all that aside.
[03:31:15.739 --> 03:31:16.860]  Who is more popular?
[03:31:18.969 --> 03:31:21.670]  Let's just leave it to a popularity contest.
[03:31:21.889 --> 03:31:24.229]  Yes, yes, right?
[03:31:24.510 --> 03:31:27.290]  Because I think this will actually kind of wake people up.
[03:31:27.450 --> 03:31:32.790]  I think viewing it this way will cause people to be like, yeah, doesn't make any sense.
[03:31:33.889 --> 03:31:38.250]  You actually believe that Donald Trump is less popular than Kamala Harris?
[03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:42.969]  That's what they're trying to tell me.
[03:31:43.149 --> 03:31:45.250]  That's what they're trying to tell you in the mainstream media.
[03:31:45.510 --> 03:31:48.690]  That's what they're trying to tell black men that are clearly rejecting Kamala Harris.
[03:31:49.030 --> 03:31:53.030]  That's what they're trying to tell Latino men like myself that are clearly rejecting Kamala Harris.
[03:31:53.909 --> 03:31:56.270]  And millions of other Americans here on planet Earth.
[03:32:00.329 --> 03:32:01.950]  You would have to believe that.
[03:32:04.530 --> 03:32:12.969]  And so with that said, I think, now I don't know, I just think between November and January, Democrats are already talking about it.
[03:32:13.809 --> 03:32:22.469]  Jamie Raskin already said, well, we'll disqualify Trump on January 5th, 2025, or 6th, before the inauguration.
[03:32:22.909 --> 03:32:29.569]  They're already interviewing Democrat congresswomen and men asking them, if Trump wins, will you guys certify it?
[03:32:29.629 --> 03:32:30.709]  And they're saying, we don't know.
[03:32:30.790 --> 03:32:33.069]  We're just going to have to make sure it was a legit win.
[03:32:33.469 --> 03:32:35.030]  We got to make sure it was real.
[03:32:36.350 --> 03:32:37.809]  So I predict...
[03:32:39.540 --> 03:32:42.319]  Trump will win in a massive landslide.
[03:32:42.860 --> 03:32:45.559]  I think the too big to rig theory will turn out to be true.
[03:32:46.780 --> 03:32:48.780]  And I think they will not certify it.
[03:32:48.879 --> 03:32:57.680]  And we will end up in a serious constitutional destabilized crisis between November and January in the upcoming months.
[03:32:57.940 --> 03:32:59.100]  So pray for this country.
[03:33:00.579 --> 03:33:01.620]  Pray for this country.
[03:33:02.280 --> 03:33:05.479]  Because that's gonna really put us in a very serious position.
[03:33:05.680 --> 03:33:10.799]  I think anybody that protests it will be called a terrorist, even if you are a liberal.
[03:33:12.299 --> 03:33:14.520]  And this is why I've been trying to tell you, look out.
[03:33:14.920 --> 03:33:16.540]  All right, guys, the War Room is up next.
[03:33:16.680 --> 03:33:18.420]  Make sure to follow me on x at Drew HLive.
[03:33:18.639 --> 03:33:19.719]  I'll see you guys on the next one.
[03:33:20.299 --> 03:33:21.819]  Hi, I'm Kamala Harris.
[03:33:22.059 --> 03:33:31.319]  When I'm elected president, platforms that promote free speech, truth, and resilience to the new world order, like thealexjonesstore.com, will be banned.
[03:33:31.819 --> 03:33:36.540]  Sites that profit off dangerous truths are a threat to our democracy.
[03:33:36.860 --> 03:33:45.719]  Shirts sold at the AlexJonesStore.com, like the Infowars limited edition fundraiser t-shirt, will no longer be tolerated.
[03:33:46.180 --> 03:33:50.139]  And let's be clear, if you're caught wearing one of these shirts, you will face arrest.
[03:33:50.670 --> 03:34:02.069]  Whether it's the Alex Jones for President 2028 shirt or any other merchandise pushing harmful messages of patriotism, family, faith, and freedom, this kind of propaganda has no place in our future.
[03:34:02.530 --> 03:34:06.290]  We will create a future where safety, censorship, and tyranny prevail.
[03:34:06.930 --> 03:34:12.750]  Don't go to thealexjonesstore.com to purchase products that keep Alex Jones on the air.
[03:34:12.989 --> 03:34:15.649]  Don't wear the shirts or support humanity.
[03:34:15.829 --> 03:34:19.629]  If you do, you'll be the first in line for my depopulation agenda.
[03:34:20.280 --> 03:34:23.879]  Now obviously that is AI satire of Kamala Harris.
[03:34:24.180 --> 03:34:25.379]  That's not really her.
[03:34:25.680 --> 03:34:32.180]  But if you look at her policies and what she supported and what big tech and the Democrats won and what Hillary Clinton has said.
[03:34:32.319 --> 03:34:38.040]  There are Americans who are engaged in this kind of propaganda.
[03:34:38.299 --> 03:34:46.540]  They are directly speaking to millions and millions of people without any level of oversight or regulation.
[03:34:47.010 --> 03:34:55.329]  Whether they should be civilly or even in some cases criminally charged is something that would be a better deterrent.
[03:34:55.510 --> 03:34:57.870]  There's no guarantee to free speech on misinformation.
[03:34:58.329 --> 03:35:01.750]  They indeed do want to put people in jail for their free speech.
[03:35:01.909 --> 03:35:09.950]  And the Justice Department that she's controlled by, that's hijacked this country, has been running the whole operation trying to shut down InfoWars.
[03:35:10.280 --> 03:35:13.680]  And on November 13th, it goes up for auction.
[03:35:14.159 --> 03:35:16.600]  And the Democrats have said, they never wanted money from me.
[03:35:16.680 --> 03:35:17.780]  They wanted me silenced.
[03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:20.340]  That was always their goal.
[03:35:20.659 --> 03:35:24.879]  Take Alex Jones' platform that he talks about away.
[03:35:25.600 --> 03:35:28.879]  I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild.
[03:35:29.299 --> 03:35:35.600]  There's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the course of Infowars and the bankruptcy estate.
[03:35:35.860 --> 03:35:39.379]  And over the course of that process, that could get very, very dangerous for Mr.
[03:35:39.540 --> 03:35:39.680]  Jones.
[03:35:40.000 --> 03:35:45.100]  I hope that we never see someone like him again.
[03:35:46.200 --> 03:35:56.260]  And if you're out there right now and you're one of Alex Jones' audience members, and you're considering giving him money, I just want you to know that based on the jury's verdict today, it's not a very good bet.
[03:35:56.979 --> 03:36:06.979]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he can't do it again.
[03:36:07.930 --> 03:36:16.709]  They're scared of satire because real satire, powerful satire, takes a truth and then basically presents it to show how absurd it is.
[03:36:16.870 --> 03:36:30.329]  So I'm asking all of you for your support to fund the AlexJonesStore.com and get these great t-shirts and ball caps so one way or another, my broadcast continues on regardless of what happens.
[03:36:30.469 --> 03:36:36.540]  We may be able to get some patriots to outbid Soros and Media Matters, For Infowars and this operation.
[03:36:36.819 --> 03:36:39.840]  But regardless, myself and the crew want to come roaring back.
[03:36:39.979 --> 03:36:43.059]  So support our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:36:43.299 --> 03:36:44.379]  Get these amazing shirts.
[03:36:44.639 --> 03:36:46.340]  That's how you keep us on air.
[03:36:46.680 --> 03:36:48.520]  And these shirts are so timely.
[03:36:48.879 --> 03:36:52.459]  Launching the First Amendment and Second Amendment Defense League.
[03:36:52.680 --> 03:36:55.219]  Standing up for the right of free speech and self-defense.
[03:36:55.620 --> 03:36:57.860]  This shirt and so many other amazing shirts.
[03:36:58.059 --> 03:37:01.159]  Now available exclusively at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:37:01.459 --> 03:37:02.379]  This is serious.
[03:37:02.700 --> 03:37:04.620]  This affects the entire country and the world.
[03:37:04.799 --> 03:37:08.079]  They're trying to get through me, as Trump says, to get to you.
[03:37:08.420 --> 03:37:09.399]  So please stand with us.
[03:37:09.639 --> 03:37:10.860]  I thank you all for your support.
