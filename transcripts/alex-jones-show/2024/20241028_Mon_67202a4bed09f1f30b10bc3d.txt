[00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.649]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:38.369]  We are living in extremely historic times.
[00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.590]  It is Monday, October 28th, 2024.
[00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.070]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.729]  We are seven days, 12 hours, 59 minutes, 20 seconds to hands down the most important election in world history.
[00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.899]  All right.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:04.359]  As of Friday, it was 5,500 TV newscasts nationally and newspaper articles saying Trump is Hitler, going to Madison Square Garden because the Nazis were there 85 years ago.
[00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.599]  That completely blew up in their face.
[00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:09.159]  It's a giant joke everywhere.
[00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.719]  They're now saying, well, Trump's dad was part German, so he's bad.
[00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:16.340]  I mean, this is...
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.040]  That's CNN, by the way.
[00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:20.140]  Well, I'm half German.
[00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:21.040]  I guess I'm bad too.
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.700]  These people are desperate.
[00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:30.159]  So, what are they going to do is the big question.
[00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:39.840]  And everywhere I go, at the gas station, at the gym, at the grocery store, walking down the street, my phone blows up just 24-7.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.659]  What's going to happen?
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.819]  And I can answer that question for you.
[00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.959]  We don't know because the globalists aren't all powerful.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.219]  And we're contending with them.
[00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.260]  And they're not exactly sure what they're going to do.
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.819]  They got different plans in play.
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.500]  But they are hesitating right now.
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:04.640]  And I'm seeing a lot of signs that if they steal it from Trump, the smarter ones understand it'll be a pyrrhic victory.
[00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:06.439]  They will win the battle but lose the war.
[00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:14.219]  They're going to try to just infiltrate his administration and sabotage him like they did eight years ago.
[00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:15.800]  Starting eight years ago.
[00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.500]  Now that's one big camp, and I'm seeing a lot of signs that's what they're going to go with.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:35.379]  But there's different camps in there, and the other camp is just going with full Civil War, armed uprising, non-certification of a Trump win.
[00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:37.879]  And of course, you don't need me to tell you that.
[00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:38.539]  You see it everywhere.
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.340]  So that's about 80% of what they're preparing for.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.340]  But the 20% of them getting ready to capitulate just started bubbling a month ago.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.259]  And within just a few days, it's happening quick.
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.080]  It'll probably be 30, 40, 50%.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.120]  And they're trying to get that message out within their own system.
[00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:01.439]  But they got a lot of true believers and crazies.
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.340]  And again, the globalists are not one perfect block.
[00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:06.639]  They've got their own factions.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:18.740]  The Trump win is so big, and the global political realignment is so big, that if I was the New World Order, I would lick my wounds and live to fight another day.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:34.120]  But instead, they are going full bore, currently, to steal the election, Block certification, hold it up for weeks, whatever they can do.
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.280]  If they can't steal it outright, they'll hold it up and try to create civil unrest, stage some false flags, blame on Trump supporters.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.699]  That's all pre-programmed.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.840]  And if they can't stop him, then they're going to have uprisings when he's president-elect.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.800]  That's all on record.
[00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.259]  And that's the official Democrat plan that they say they're going to do it.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.639]  Not just Carville, that's legislation introduced.
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.840]  To block Trump, once he's even president, from stopping uprisings that are illegal.
[00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:07.759]  So, I don't know exactly what the establishment's going to do, because there's a battle going on, clearly.
[00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.680]  And they even now admit that in the news, that Democrats are preparing to capitulate.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.099]  A lot of top Democrats behind the scenes are preparing for a loss.
[00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.720]  They're telling their people to prepare for it.
[00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.240]  I've got all those articles, I'll go over them.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:27.199]  I think Tucker Carlson's eight and a half minute speech last night in Madison Square Garden was not just the best speech of the night.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.420]  It was the best speech.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.759]  And boy, does he give good speeches, great speeches.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.399]  The best ever.
[00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:33.879]  So that's coming up.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.360]  And it's just an incredible time to be alive.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.800]  But remember, this is not a spectator sport.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.480]  Freedom is not a spectator sport.
[00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:42.160]  It is a...
[00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:44.790]  Sport where you all got skin in the game.
[00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.509]  So take the live feed, whether you're listening on local radio or watching on TV or watching us on Real Alex Jones on X and share this live feed right now on the show.
[00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:52.050]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:52.170 --> 00:05:09.810]  We are now seven days out from D-Day and I'm going to lay out the very best analysis and thinking on what's currently happening and all the different signals being sent We're good to go.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.899]  Austria.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.759]  The list goes on and on.
[00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:37.519]  And their only fallback is to bring in a total dictatorship and have staged elections like Venezuela or like they're doing in Brazil that the CIA has been helping with in the case of Brazil.
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.019]  So don't think the globalists aren't going to try to stay in power.
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.839]  They are.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.519]  And so I'm going to walk through those different scenarios here today and all the different developments that are unfolding today.
[00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:54.449]  On this Monday, October 28th, 2024 transmission.
[00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:01.449]  Now, let's get into it together here.
[00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.370]  And there is a lot of it.
[00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:09.620]  First off, the Madison Square Garden event was a seismic event.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:23.120]  It was a coming home for the favorite son of New York, totally demonized, lied about, set up, and the fact is, it's completely backfired, as you know, not just around the country, but in New York itself.
[00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:36.920]  The mayor's been defending Trump, saying it's complete crap, that he's a Nazi, that, oh, the Nazis were there 85 years ago, so that means he's there, when the Democrats have had a bunch of conventions there, so the Republicans, it's just ridiculous.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.620]  Now CNN's saying the Trumps try to hide their German heritage.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.459]  Now, just being German means you're a Nazi, because his dad was German or part German.
[00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:48.800]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:52.060]  Absolute, pure...
[00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:58.329]  Devastation of the system.
[00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.569]  And then a Tony Hitchcliffe, good friend of mine, joke about his humor.
[00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.189]  He attacks white people, Hispanics, blacks, Jews, everybody.
[00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.629]  You know, good old-fashioned Richard Pryor type stuff.
[00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.050]  Made a joke about Puerto Rico being a floating island of garbage.
[00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.449]  Actually, a very pretty island, but there is a lot of garbage.
[00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.689]  That he hates Hispanics.
[00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:17.970]  Nobody's buying that crap.
[00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.069]  So it's just crazy.
[00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.709]  Tucker had the best speech last night.
[00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.870]  Elon did a great job as well.
[00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.769]  And I want to play Elon's speech coming up because what he says is true.
[00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:42.410]  Prosperity, if you have a competitive society and if you have cheap energy and you have innovation, which we have all of those, if the globalists got off our backs, is the default position.
[00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.050]  It is the default position.
[00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:52.250]  And so, a lot of folks, it's become a news story, why am I wearing black aviator glasses?
[00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:55.110]  I'm going to say this once today and then move on.
[00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.310]  It happens every four or five years.
[00:07:57.449 --> 00:07:59.589]  It seems to happen around election time, like the last two times it happened.
[00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:01.790]  I'll just wake up with a busted blood vessel in my eye.
[00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:09.529]  And it might be weightlifting related because I was doing some deadlifts, not even that heavy, Thursday.
[00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:11.310]  And then I had a broken blood vessel Friday.
[00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.009]  It got worse over the weekend and it hurts.
[00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:13.870]  The light hurts.
[00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.930]  It doesn't hurt that bad now.
[00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.509]  I don't mind the vampire look with the red eyes.
[00:08:19.769 --> 00:08:21.290]  It's about 60% better.
[00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.769]  So this will be the last day.
[00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.209]  Hopefully I'm wearing these aviator glasses.
[00:08:25.209 --> 00:08:28.449]  I'm not doing it to try to look cool or be like Joe Biden.
[00:08:29.269 --> 00:08:30.089]  But that's a...
[00:08:31.939 --> 00:08:41.580]  Less of a stretch to say I'm Joe Biden because I'm wearing black aviator glasses than saying Trump's a Nazi because 85 years ago in 1939, the American Nazi Party had a rally there.
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.019]  So by extension, Hitler breathed air, you breathe air, you're Hitler.
[00:08:45.179 --> 00:08:47.919]  Hitler drank water, you drink water, you're Hitler.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.000]  Hitler drove a car, you drive a car, you're Hitler.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.179]  Hitler wore sunglasses, sometimes you wear sunglasses, you're Hitler.
[00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:58.659]  Joe Biden wears sunglasses, you wear sunglasses, you're Joe Biden.
[00:08:59.929 --> 00:09:02.330]  I mean, it's just mindless, isn't it?
[00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:12.690]  What does it say about what the globalist establishment and their puppets have to offer in the realm of substance that that's all they've got?
[00:09:13.529 --> 00:09:15.649]  I mean, it really tells you everything you need to know.
[00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.009]  But Tucker completely nailed it, so I want to start with his speech right now.
[00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:21.169]  It's only eight and a half minutes long.
[00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:30.960]  And in this speech of eight and a half minutes, I could teach a college course on populism and world politics and Americana and just everything.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.620]  He says it all in eight and a half minutes.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:50.779]  And the biggest takeaway is that Trump is the litmus test with all the establishment demonization saying he is Satan incarnate and the worst person since Satan or Adolf Hitler and Stalin and Mao all rolled into one and none of it's true.
[00:09:52.769 --> 00:09:59.009]  And then people love him more because they don't believe the establishment and have caught them in so many lies.
[00:09:59.289 --> 00:10:00.470]  That's a big takeaway.
[00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:05.110]  Also the fact that Kamala Harris is as popular as death.
[00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.429]  She's as popular as cancer.
[00:10:08.629 --> 00:10:13.149]  And the fact that they're going to try to sell her as the winner...
[00:10:15.039 --> 00:10:30.139]  When all of the scientific polls and betting averages and big AI indexes of positive comments that corporations and governments really look at show a mega-massive landslide, CNN even admits Trump, right now, the election was held,
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.519]  even with their skewed polls and oversample Democrats, that Trump will win the popular vote.
[00:10:35.899 --> 00:10:41.240]  Something he reportedly didn't win in 2016 or 2020, but he did win the Electoral College in 2016.
[00:10:41.539 --> 00:10:44.360]  And of course, we know they stole it, and that's all been evidence and proven.
[00:10:46.509 --> 00:11:13.940]  With all the investigations that have happened and now we have Colorado, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona where they're finding caches of thousands of fake voter registrations in the last few months trying to get Fake names and people that are dead and people that never voted and people that live out of district,
[00:11:14.259 --> 00:11:20.480]  but also just no names on a lot of them, sent out to these addresses but also put on the voter rolls.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:29.940]  And so last Thursday and Friday, one county found thousands and thousands and they confirmed it was a fraud and went out to people's houses that were real names.
[00:11:30.039 --> 00:11:31.679]  And they said, no, I didn't sign up for this.
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:32.240]  I'm not a voter.
[00:11:32.419 --> 00:11:34.220]  I didn't fill this out.
[00:11:35.539 --> 00:11:37.659]  And so a bunch of other counties started finding the same thing.
[00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:47.960]  And so hackers hit the database of voter registration and brought down the state database.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.259]  And then similar things happened in other battlegrounds.
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.460]  And remember what the feds said two months ago?
[00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:58.379]  And I showed this in a Saturday emergency report I did, where you just type into a search engine, feds warn voters.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.179]  State voter databases to be targeted during election.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:17.740]  And then magically, right when states start finding it in Colorado and Pennsylvania and other places, oh, there's outages and oh, it looks like somebody took this down.
[00:12:19.879 --> 00:12:23.820]  Yeah, it's called the CIA, who's protecting the election.
[00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:32.269]  And of course, they're finding in Pennsylvania and other states that the fraud is Democrats, people being registered as Democrats who aren't voters.
[00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.669]  And of course, it's the Democrats behind it.
[00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.169]  They go out and hire private groups to do it.
[00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.929]  It's the plausible liability.
[00:12:38.309 --> 00:12:39.190]  They get caught.
[00:12:39.429 --> 00:12:45.830]  How do you prove, how do you check to see the voter registration rolls if they're real people or not?
[00:12:45.889 --> 00:12:47.129]  Well, you have a database of that.
[00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.629]  And now the databases is right where you'd hit if you were the Democrat deep state.
[00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.169]  Stop that.
[00:12:52.309 --> 00:12:55.970]  I mean, they have the motive, they have the history, and then they hit the targets that help them.
[00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.970]  That's what you call motive and means.
[00:13:00.889 --> 00:13:01.330]  Capability?
[00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.549]  So, that's happening.
[00:13:05.789 --> 00:13:10.210]  But notice this time, during the election, because it's ongoing, as you know, for weeks.
[00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:11.169]  We're in the election now.
[00:13:11.769 --> 00:13:13.669]  Election day is the 5th.
[00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.129]  Next Tuesday, but it's happening now.
[00:13:19.429 --> 00:13:24.409]  So it's seven days, if you count election day, it's eight days till the election day is done.
[00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:28.250]  And the Democrats have pledged it's going to go on for weeks and weeks.
[00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:40.110]  Oh my God, the Trump supporters are going to kill black people and Trump's going to use the military on black people and Hispanics and brown people and there's going to be terror attacks by Trump supporters.
[00:13:40.769 --> 00:13:43.269]  FBI alerts with no evidence.
[00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:46.450]  We have an FBI that staged January 6th.
[00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:48.750]  We have an FBI that staged the Whitmer kidnapping, fake plot.
[00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:49.330]  That's come out.
[00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:50.889]  They have the means.
[00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.509]  They have the motive.
[00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:52.269]  They have the history.
[00:13:53.970 --> 00:14:00.190]  And then the last piece will be terror attacks on black people or Hispanics or both.
[00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:08.330]  And I hope by exposing this and pointing out that's the logical last piece by the people that have the motive who've done stuff like this before.
[00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:10.250]  I mean, will we get another Oklahoma City bombing?
[00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:13.950]  You research that, boy, we know exactly who did it.
[00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:25.950]  In the Clinton administration, the Justice Department, working with the CIA. I've written books and made films, interviewed the experts, the witnesses, and just everybody.
[00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:28.990]  I mean, for folks that never investigated Oklahoma City, that's a whole other show.
[00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:33.190]  But that's the model of what we're seeing here.
[00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:41.710]  Because you're being told by the Vice President and by Tampon Tim and by all of them that Trump is going to kill you right now.
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.899]  And they're coming to kill minorities, who are the majority now in most areas, right now.
[00:14:47.659 --> 00:15:01.259]  And they're trying to steal the election in front of us, and I've got more reports out of Virginia and North Carolina and Alabama and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Arizona, everywhere.
[00:15:03.379 --> 00:15:06.519]  The federal judges are ruling, Democrats all, that are doing it.
[00:15:07.019 --> 00:15:08.159]  Oh, you know what?
[00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:17.519]  We're just going to keep all these phantom voters that have never been on the voter rolls, or in some cases have been, but aren't even real people in many cases, or are dead.
[00:15:18.159 --> 00:15:20.600]  We're going to keep them on the rolls.
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.200]  I've got those articles I'll show you, but you've already heard about them.
[00:15:23.539 --> 00:15:24.960]  There's been more federal rulings.
[00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:30.460]  Oh, 500,000 plus in Michigan's, the biggest one.
[00:15:31.399 --> 00:15:32.500]  They're not even voters.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.360]  Some of the names aren't even real.
[00:15:35.259 --> 00:15:37.960]  But they're like, oh yeah, we're just going to keep that on there.
[00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:42.200]  So these people coming, whoever they are, to vote in those names can.
[00:15:44.179 --> 00:15:55.759]  That's 10 times plus what Trump lost Michigan by four years ago that they have just in a cache of $500,000 and change.
[00:15:58.159 --> 00:16:01.519]  And you've got similar crap all over the country happening.
[00:16:02.539 --> 00:16:13.120]  And places like Virginia, it's bipartisan law that if you're an illegal alien and that you're not supposed to be on the voter rolls or it's a fake name, it's removed.
[00:16:14.299 --> 00:16:16.639]  Federal judge just ruled, yep, it all stays on.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:26.019]  So, despite all that, though, a bunch of states...
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.340]  Have removed millions of illegal aliens and dead people off the rolls like Texas.
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:37.799]  And the feds are claiming there's a rule you can't do it close to the election.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:42.500]  So that's how they're keeping even more they found on the rolls.
[00:16:42.799 --> 00:16:44.740]  So yeah, they're trying to steal it.
[00:16:45.419 --> 00:16:48.500]  But it's like trying to eat an elephant when you're trying to stop a landslide.
[00:16:49.659 --> 00:16:53.019]  So extremely, extremely big deals.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:53.820]  So let me just...
[00:16:56.129 --> 00:17:03.690]  Go to this Tucker Carlson speech that is absolutely dead on about the realignment, the great awakening.
[00:17:03.809 --> 00:17:04.769]  Trump is going to win.
[00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.690]  And we're seeing more and more signs of the establishment capitulating and realizing that I'll cover after the break.
[00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.309]  There's Tucker Carlson last night knocking it out of the park.
[00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:12.230]  His greatest speech yet.
[00:17:12.529 --> 00:17:13.650]  Not just the greatest speech of the night.
[00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.150]  Greatest speech of Tucker Carlson.
[00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:16.430]  Absolutely dead on.
[00:17:16.509 --> 00:17:16.849]  Here it is.
[00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:19.990]  I'm...
[00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.910]  I saw the Grateful Dead in this arena in 1987.
[00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:27.349]  I was seated right there.
[00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:28.690]  How weird.
[00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.430]  It's such an honor to be here.
[00:17:33.829 --> 00:17:35.190]  And it's wild.
[00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.250]  Just another day following Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.250]  at a Donald Trump rally in Madison Square Garden.
[00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:47.450]  That's totally normal.
[00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:52.710]  Liz Cheney is out there with Kamala Harris.
[00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:57.869]  And there's Bobby Kennedy calling to protect women's sports at a Trump rally.
[00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.549]  It's a realignment.
[00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:02.130]  It's unbelievable.
[00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.490]  And the fact that it's here is even sweeter.
[00:18:07.229 --> 00:18:21.490]  Imagine if you're, and just pause for one moment, imagine you're Donald Trump, you're from New York City, you become famous in New York City, you make your fortune in New York City, and all of a sudden the leadership of New York City decides they're gonna destroy you because they don't like your politics.
[00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.730]  And so they, yeah boo, imagine if that were you though.
[00:18:26.369 --> 00:18:32.910]  And they try and take everything that you have, they try and put you in prison, they try and put your children in prison.
[00:18:33.769 --> 00:18:37.589]  If that happened to you, how often do you think you'd be going back to New York City?
[00:18:38.369 --> 00:18:39.390]  How about never?
[00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:41.490]  And yet he's here.
[00:18:41.609 --> 00:18:43.069]  It's like getting thrown out of a bar.
[00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:47.349]  And you think to yourself, well, you know, all my friends are in the bar.
[00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.390]  And you approach the door and there's the bouncer like, you're not allowed in here.
[00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.450]  But from behind the bouncer, you hear the cheers of your friend.
[00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:56.309]  Come on in!
[00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.769]  And the bouncer hangs his head in shame.
[00:19:00.009 --> 00:19:00.289]  Ugh.
[00:19:01.859 --> 00:19:06.640]  He's embarrassed that he's working for the man trying to keep the most popular person out of the bar.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:14.200]  And that's Donald Trump back in the city that produced him with no embarrassment at all in a room full of his friends.
[00:19:16.319 --> 00:19:22.400]  The stones that takes, the bravery that takes is incredible.
[00:19:23.299 --> 00:19:24.920]  Donald Trump's gonna win.
[00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:27.779]  He's gonna win.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.519]  I know that that's true.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.539]  Why is Donald Trump gonna win?
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.380]  The people he's about to defeat have no idea.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.299]  And they're panicked.
[00:19:38.339 --> 00:19:40.140]  They have no idea why people like Donald Trump.
[00:19:41.329 --> 00:19:46.130]  And their first theory was, well, Donald Trump is evil, so half the country's evil also.
[00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:52.630]  And that's one of the reasons they spent the last four years trying to destroy the country, because they're mad at its voters for liking Donald Trump.
[00:19:52.910 --> 00:20:01.609]  How much easier would it have been just to pause for 20 minutes and ask yourself honestly in some silent place, why do people like Donald Trump?
[00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:08.690]  And if they had been honest enough to ask themselves that question, they would have come up with the two main reasons, and here's what they are.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.779]  The first reason that people like Donald Trump is because he likes them.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:13.940]  That's why.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.180]  And it's real.
[00:20:16.279 --> 00:20:18.059]  Affection is something you can't fake.
[00:20:18.779 --> 00:20:23.059]  I don't care how many times Kamala Harris would tell me she loves me, I don't believe her.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.259]  I saw her kiss her husband with a mask on.
[00:20:28.839 --> 00:20:30.380]  A mask on.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.259]  That's her version of love.
[00:20:35.299 --> 00:20:35.960]  It's fake.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:36.880]  It's not real.
[00:20:37.519 --> 00:20:40.700]  They spent 10 years telling you Trump is a hater.
[00:20:40.839 --> 00:20:41.720]  Do you feel that on him?
[00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:42.460]  No, you don't.
[00:20:43.059 --> 00:20:44.019]  Because it's not there.
[00:20:44.099 --> 00:20:45.259]  I've spent a lot of time with Trump.
[00:20:46.259 --> 00:20:51.680]  And there's not one moment I've ever been with him off camera where he's spending his time grousing about people he hates.
[00:20:52.099 --> 00:20:52.500]  Ever.
[00:20:53.119 --> 00:20:56.720]  He's talking about the people and the country he loves in his private time.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.559]  Trust me.
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:11.220]  And people know in a country that has been taken over by a leadership class that actually despises them and their values and their history and their culture and their customs really hates them to the point that it's trying to replace them.
[00:21:12.369 --> 00:21:16.849]  They know someone who actually has affection for them, and that's Donald Trump.
[00:21:17.089 --> 00:21:18.109]  And it's requited.
[00:21:18.529 --> 00:21:19.390]  It's requited.
[00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:19.829]  They know.
[00:21:20.109 --> 00:21:24.589]  When he goes to McDonald's and serves fries, it's like, he's not faking that at all.
[00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.069]  That's why that worked.
[00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.170]  Democratic media consultants are like, how is that working?
[00:21:29.369 --> 00:21:30.230]  Because it's real.
[00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:31.069]  That's why.
[00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:37.410]  And the second reason that people love Trump, and I put myself in this category, it's why I'm here today.
[00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:42.589]  It's because he's liberated us in the deepest and truest sense.
[00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:47.730]  And the liberation he has brought to us is the liberation from the obligation to tell lies.
[00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:54.289]  Donald Trump has made it possible for the rest of us to tell the truth about the world around us.
[00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:59.250]  And that's the single most liberating thing you can do for people.
[00:21:59.809 --> 00:22:05.630]  If you want to enslave people, if you want to degrade them, force them to tell lies.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.299]  And they have.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.519]  They forced us to lie about everything at gunpoint, effectively.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.160]  They put people in prison for refusing to lie.
[00:22:15.519 --> 00:22:21.819]  And not just the obvious lies that men can become women or Vladimir Putin blew up the Nord Stream pipeline.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:22.819]  No, honestly, he did.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.940]  January 6th was an insurrection.
[00:22:26.079 --> 00:22:27.940]  They were unarmed, but it was very insurrection-y.
[00:22:28.599 --> 00:22:31.380]  Not even the obvious ones, but the big lie.
[00:22:31.779 --> 00:22:33.059]  You know what the big lie is?
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.660]  The big lie is that they're impressive.
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.140]  That's what the big lie is.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.119]  That the people in charge have somehow earned the right to rule over you, and they haven't.
[00:22:41.299 --> 00:22:42.420]  And you know that.
[00:22:43.079 --> 00:22:46.160]  These are the single most useless people in the United States.
[00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:48.380]  They have no skills whatsoever.
[00:22:50.059 --> 00:22:53.619]  They've got three quarters of the money and they didn't earn it.
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:23:02.039]  They set up a system precisely for the purpose of awarding themselves wealth and power when it's undeserved.
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:13.019]  You look at Liz Cheney and you ask yourself honestly, What skill could she possibly have that allowed her to send hundreds of thousands of people to their deaths?
[00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:14.380]  Did she earn that?
[00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:15.500]  I don't think she did.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.339]  No fair system would make Liz Cheney powerful.
[00:23:19.579 --> 00:23:21.759]  No fair system would make Larry Fink rich.
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:27.599]  No fair system would elevate someone like Kamala Harris to a presidential nomination.
[00:23:28.579 --> 00:23:30.019]  She's never been...
[00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.309]  Accused of doing anything useful.
[00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.829]  She has precisely no achievements.
[00:23:34.829 --> 00:23:36.970]  She's a nominee without getting a single vote.
[00:23:37.609 --> 00:23:54.109]  She is a metaphor for the system they created to make themselves rich and powerful, and then they have the gall to lecture you, the people who can actually change a flat tire and repair a power grid, who have useful jobs, who pay your taxes and work 40 hours a week,
[00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.809]  lecture you that you are somehow immoral.
[00:23:57.799 --> 00:24:05.220]  And Donald Trump has empowered the rest of us through mostly just sticking around in the face of their hate and abuse and persecution.
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.119]  He has given the rest of us the right to call BS on the charade.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.819]  No, you are not better than us.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.339]  No, you are not smarter than us.
[00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:16.460]  No, you do not deserve what you have.
[00:24:16.579 --> 00:24:17.799]  You probably stole it.
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.440]  No, you're not going to bully me into silence anymore.
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:28.700]  And I can promise you at this point, Nine days out when Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:37.859]  and Elon Musk and Tulsi Gabbard and pretty much every high school senior and college shorty girl in the country has come out finally saying, yeah, I am for Donald Trump, actually.
[00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:43.210]  When the entire country has realized there is nothing embarrassing about this.
[00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:48.970]  What's embarrassing is to take a perfectly great country and destroy it as they have.
[00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.009]  I'm not ashamed.
[00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:52.190]  You should be.
[00:24:52.890 --> 00:25:01.130]  At that moment, it's going to be pretty tough for them 10 days from now to look in the eye to America with a straight face.
[00:25:02.049 --> 00:25:04.069]  It's going to be pretty hard to look at us.
[00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.029]  And say, you know what?
[00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:10.650]  Kamala Harris, she's just, she got 85 million votes because she's just so impressive.
[00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:21.200]  As the first Samoan Malaysian Low IQ former California prosecutor ever to be elected president.
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.420]  It was just a groundswell of popular support.
[00:25:23.779 --> 00:25:26.480]  And anyone who thinks otherwise is just a freak or a criminal.
[00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:37.819]  At this stage of the game, after nine years of listening to their lies and finding every single one of them totally false, no, it's not safe and effective, and no, she's not impressive.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:43.119]  It's very hard for me to believe the rest of us are going to say, you know what, Joe Scarborough, you're right.
[00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.650]  You're right.
[00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.710]  She won fair and square because she's just so impressive.
[00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:49.970]  I don't think so.
[00:25:50.589 --> 00:25:53.549]  And to me, that is liberation.
[00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:59.630]  It's the freedom to say what's obviously true as a free man and not a slave.
[00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:03.829]  And I just want to say thank you, Donald Trump, for that.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.559]  The speech is up at Real Alex Jones on X. I suggest you share it.
[00:26:12.619 --> 00:26:13.819]  He says it all in eight and a half minutes.
[00:26:14.019 --> 00:26:15.019]  This is liberation.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:21.119]  This is the bullying and the trance and the mind control being broken on the people.
[00:26:21.519 --> 00:26:22.940]  It's a lot bigger than Trump.
[00:26:23.599 --> 00:26:31.039]  It's about finding our will and our destiny again and realizing these people will try to bully and intimidate us and put their boot on our necks.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:42.720]  And are trying to bankrupt us in their own policies to make us so poor they can dictate absolute hellish social control to the point of sterilization, depopulation, and death.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.599]  It's really a death cult.
[00:26:44.859 --> 00:26:57.000]  And thanks to all of you in this audience, something we talked about decades ago that almost no one knew, is now the number one topic with Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Elon Musk and Donald Trump and RFK Jr.
[00:26:57.019 --> 00:26:58.859]  And there's no putting the genie back in the bottle.
[00:26:59.039 --> 00:27:00.900]  And Tulsi Gabbard and the list goes on and on.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:02.839]  We have the initiative.
[00:27:02.839 --> 00:27:05.339]  We are winning big time, hearts and minds.
[00:27:05.559 --> 00:27:08.740]  The system's cornered, and it'll do almost anything to stay in power.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.880]  But nothing they do is going to work now.
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.900]  They can win a battle, but they're always going to lose the war.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:27:15.119 --> 00:27:15.480]  Stay with us.
[00:27:15.559 --> 00:27:16.039]  We'll be right back.
[00:27:41.719 --> 00:27:42.940]  You got it right here.
[00:27:43.339 --> 00:27:44.700]  The ultimate gut cleanse.
[00:27:44.819 --> 00:27:46.420]  This is not just a gut cleanse.
[00:27:46.779 --> 00:27:47.920]  It's not just a detox.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.220]  It doesn't just have natural ingredients that gently get rid of parasites.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.539]  Oh, it's got that covered.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.960]  It's then got a whole bunch of stuff in it like saw palmetto that's good for all your glands.
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.940]  And even the government admits great for men's prostates.
[00:28:00.099 --> 00:28:02.140]  And it goes on and on.
[00:28:02.319 --> 00:28:03.839]  I cannot read all the ingredients.
[00:28:04.019 --> 00:28:04.980]  They're concentrated.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.059]  They're incredible.
[00:28:06.339 --> 00:28:11.500]  You want to get it right now at thealexjonesstore.com for between 30 and 50% off.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.900]  50% off if you do the combo and get it with the ultimate probiotic.
[00:28:16.019 --> 00:28:18.259]  I'm hosting all four hours today until 3 p.m.
[00:28:18.339 --> 00:28:20.259]  Central when Owen Schroyer takes over for the war room.
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:25.279]  Del Bigtree behind the Maha Trump-RFK Jr.
[00:28:25.539 --> 00:28:31.460]  Alliance will be in the studio to cover the waterfront, the election, the realignment, the poison shots, all the news coming out on that.
[00:28:31.599 --> 00:28:37.420]  Del Bigtree putting out these amazing TV ads exposing the globalists thanks to the financing of Elon Musk.
[00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:41.849]  That is all coming up in the third and fourth hour today.
[00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:50.690]  And we have a really interesting, informative talk show host, Candace Horbach, joining us to talk about the election and more next hour.
[00:28:51.849 --> 00:29:07.950]  Also, I am planning, I'll be announcing it tomorrow, starting later in the week, and then right through next week on election night, we're going to be doing special live nighttime shows here out of the Infowar studios that can be shut down in just 15 days,
[00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:15.289]  and out of the new studios at the Alex Jones Network, and that is at AJNLiveOnX.
[00:29:15.309 --> 00:29:15.789]  Follow us.
[00:29:15.809 --> 00:29:27.250]  We're good to go.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.059]  But the evidence is the system's starting to cave in.
[00:29:44.259 --> 00:29:45.759]  The landslide's too big to steal.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:51.920]  I'm not making a perfect prediction on that, but I am seeing some very, very good signs that are accelerating.
[00:29:52.599 --> 00:29:54.819]  First off, I'm taking on the deep state.
[00:29:54.819 --> 00:29:56.119]  I'm taking on the globalist.
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.299]  And if you back me, I can beat them with your help.
[00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:00.730]  Plus, we have great products you need.
[00:30:00.809 --> 00:30:02.930]  So you really need to go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:30:03.349 --> 00:30:13.190]  We launched this sweepstakes with our great sponsors there with $136,000 amazing Dodge Turbo Diesel, super off-road package, the most incredible truck I've ever driven.
[00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:17.369]  $36,000 value plus $10,000 cash.
[00:30:17.509 --> 00:30:23.069]  On top of that, that will be announced Wednesday here on the broadcast.
[00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:28.549]  So that is very, very exciting.
[00:30:28.769 --> 00:30:31.849]  And you can go to the site and put in your email for free and get entered to win.
[00:30:32.049 --> 00:30:36.190]  Every time you buy a t-shirt or a supplement or a hoodie or a ball cap, you get entered a whole bunch of times.
[00:30:36.609 --> 00:30:40.329]  So last chance to be part of that at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:46.470]  Also, when you go to thealexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP, or there's a big red link at the top, It's $30 a month.
[00:30:46.609 --> 00:30:47.329]  Cancel any time.
[00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:48.609]  That way you remember to support.
[00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:51.910]  You get $40 of purchase in the store.
[00:30:52.089 --> 00:30:56.890]  That's making $10 a month extra if you're going to be buying stuff in the store.
[00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:59.490]  And that just backs what we're doing.
[00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:03.289]  It gives us that support we need to go into the future.
[00:31:03.819 --> 00:31:10.799]  I want to thank all of you that have become members of the VIP. You also get even bigger discounts on top of things, and you get special offers and special deals.
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.480]  There's going to be custom knives made in Arkansas.
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.940]  The last one we offered sold out in two days.
[00:31:16.059 --> 00:31:18.240]  It'll just be for VIP members.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.299]  Stuff like that is imminent.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:31.440]  And you've seen all the new top-of-the-line supplements being added, the CMOS, the Hydro Force, that isn't just an amazing fruit punch.
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:35.740]  Electrolytes.
[00:31:35.859 --> 00:31:37.140]  It's got the vitamins, the minerals.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.480]  It's a pre-workout, post-workout.
[00:31:39.599 --> 00:31:40.759]  It's just so good for you.
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:41.740]  Hydroforce.
[00:31:42.279 --> 00:31:45.160]  All of the supplements are up to 55% off when you get three bottles.
[00:31:45.259 --> 00:31:46.220]  50% when you get two.
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.140]  40% is the deal going right now when you buy one.
[00:31:49.559 --> 00:31:50.700]  And it's all in stock.
[00:31:50.859 --> 00:31:52.680]  The CMOS that is the ultimate superfood.
[00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:54.259]  I'm not going to spend an hour telling you why it's so great.
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.759]  It's got the organic iodine and everything else in it.
[00:31:56.839 --> 00:31:57.960]  The CMOS is just magic.
[00:31:58.519 --> 00:31:59.259]  That's up there.
[00:31:59.539 --> 00:32:01.480]  There's so much more at the AlexJonesStore.com.
[00:32:01.599 --> 00:32:02.500]  And now is the time...
[00:32:03.109 --> 00:32:16.390]  To be part of history and fund this operation because whatever happens to Infowars and the Deep State's seven-year battle to shut us down, and it's been going on before that, but it's been very intense for seven years, we will continue on thanks to your backing, and now is the time.
[00:32:16.529 --> 00:32:18.369]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:32:18.849 --> 00:32:24.069]  Also, our other great sponsor, my ad supplement company with amazing products, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:32:24.069 --> 00:32:25.509]  Be sure and mark that down.
[00:32:25.829 --> 00:32:30.430]  All of these are the destinations to get great products and be part of the second American Revolution worldwide.
[00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:31.509]  We're so close to winning.
[00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:46.609]  And we need to still be on the air, obviously, when he's president-elect and president to fight the globalists, but also alert Trump to any bad guys inside his operations, something we did in his first term that we really got targeted for, but we're not going to back down in that.
[00:32:46.769 --> 00:32:53.650]  So two days, 15 hours, 22 minutes until we announce the winner of the big sweepstakes, the Alex Jones store.com.
[00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:57.190]  And again, there are so many other great products there on the site.
[00:32:57.799 --> 00:32:59.059]  I want to thank all you for your support.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:32:59.940]  I want to encourage folks.
[00:33:00.119 --> 00:33:01.579]  Now, history's happening.
[00:33:01.819 --> 00:33:02.759]  I bet on freedom.
[00:33:02.759 --> 00:33:03.480]  I believe in you.
[00:33:03.559 --> 00:33:04.200]  You believe in us.
[00:33:04.319 --> 00:33:05.059]  We've come so far together.
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.339]  I want to thank those that have been supporting.
[00:33:06.519 --> 00:33:08.079]  I want to encourage those that have been on the fence.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.200]  You really want these products.
[00:33:09.319 --> 00:33:19.720]  By the way, they're super concentrated antiviral pro-immune system product right now with concentrated elderberry and more.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.480]  And during this time of the year, that's something really important to do.
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.960]  That's the new product being added today.
[00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:29.549]  at thealexjonesstore.com as I just said.
[00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:30.869]  So action is victory.
[00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:39.789]  Please take action now and fund the media operation the globalists fear the most because they fear we the people and we're here energizing the population.
[00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:42.130]  We're here explaining how the globalists operate.
[00:33:42.309 --> 00:33:49.130]  We're here exposing their plans and decompartmentalizing their operations and defeating them time and time again.
[00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:55.200]  So it's a badge of honor to be targeted by these people But without you, we cannot do it.
[00:33:55.259 --> 00:33:59.299]  But we have the power of the people, and that's why we've still been able to hang on here and be so successful.
[00:33:59.299 --> 00:34:05.079]  We're reaching so many new people today right now, and all glory goes to God, but God's working through you, so I thank you all.
[00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:08.360]  Okay, let's go ahead and plow through it.
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:10.739]  Overhead shot, then I'll get into the details.
[00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:12.929]  Breaking.
[00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:15.429]  More states in play for Trump.
[00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:20.110]  Look at what's happening in two more safe blue states that are no longer safe.
[00:34:20.269 --> 00:34:27.409]  Those are New Mexico and New Hampshire that have got Trump leading or positive in a dead heat with Kamala.
[00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:29.010]  That's why they're so scared.
[00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:29.809]  Panic time.
[00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:35.130]  Long time Nevada early vote analyst announces code red for Kamala Harris.
[00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:38.309]  This guy's called all the Nevada elections going back for 40 years.
[00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:40.250]  That's a big deal.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.019]  Fourth Circuit, though, sides with DOJ in Virginia.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.340]  Non-citizen voter skirmish.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.960]  Next stop, Supreme Court.
[00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:54.320]  And even though the law in Virginia is bipartisan, for decades the illegal aliens can't vote.
[00:34:54.519 --> 00:34:56.039]  Everybody just thinks that's the case.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.340]  The feds have said no.
[00:34:58.719 --> 00:35:00.059]  The court has said no.
[00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:01.179]  The Fourth Circuit has said no.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:01.820]  They can vote.
[00:35:02.719 --> 00:35:03.880]  CNN analyst.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.800]  Trump on course to win popular vote.
[00:35:09.539 --> 00:35:10.199]  Think about that.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.659]  Republican winning the popular vote.
[00:35:12.519 --> 00:35:14.739]  Last time that happened was 1988.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:20.239]  And that's, again, in these skewed polls, it's even worse for them.
[00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.699]  And that's one reason.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:28.659]  Now he's getting the majority of the Muslim groups are endorsing Trump because he's anti-war.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:36.500]  And the system is in absolute, complete meltdown, panic mode right now.
[00:35:37.389 --> 00:35:38.690]  Time to abort the Democrats.
[00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:41.210]  I agree with the headline out of Town Hall.
[00:35:41.909 --> 00:35:45.750]  The Madison Square Garden rally is the perfect setup for vindicating Trump.
[00:35:45.889 --> 00:35:47.989]  That's exactly what it did.
[00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:50.670]  And then continuing on here...
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:56.039]  Far-left media launches all-out Trump-Hitler blitzkrieg.
[00:35:56.219 --> 00:36:02.579]  5,500 and counting stories in one week that Trump is Hitler, but that didn't work.
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:09.940]  We've got the MSNBC report saying, look, for the first time since 1939, 85 years ago, Nazis are meeting.
[00:36:10.119 --> 00:36:14.659]  So they call Trump a Nazi and then say, look, Nazis met there 85 years ago.
[00:36:16.489 --> 00:36:22.329]  But the mayor came out and said this is absolutely preposterous and ridiculous and un-American and he should be allowed to be there and he's not a Nazi.
[00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:30.469]  Much to Democrats' chagrin, no Nazis were found at Trump's MAGA Square Garden rally.
[00:36:31.789 --> 00:36:36.929]  But then CNN has this headline, Trump's family denied German heritage for years.
[00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:38.650]  And you read the article, it's just made up.
[00:36:39.389 --> 00:36:43.110]  Trump's, his dad, dad mainly German, his mom's Scottish.
[00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:46.389]  Not hiding his, Trump's a German name.
[00:36:47.789 --> 00:36:51.530]  So, again, just absolute insanity.
[00:36:51.969 --> 00:36:56.349]  Elon Musk, enemy of open borders, launched his career working illegally.
[00:36:56.369 --> 00:36:59.329]  That's the kind of crap that, I mean, that's all they've got.
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:07.280]  And when you expand on that, we have Jewish people attending mass.
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.639]  Trump Nazi rally in Madison Square Garden.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.500]  Didn't they get the memo?
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:15.980]  So there's some of the news on that front.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:22.300]  But as Liberation Day approaches, the left has gone completely apoplectic.
[00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:33.750]  Despite all the big tech censorship, all the big corporate donations going to Kamala, 90 plus percent of them, it's still not working because once the public's awake, it's game over.
[00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:37.210]  The desperation of Kamala Harris is palpable.
[00:37:37.949 --> 00:37:40.769]  Dems are privately admitting that Kamala is going to lose.
[00:37:41.369 --> 00:37:43.550]  They're gearing up people to get ready for that.
[00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:53.030]  Kamala overtaken by the spirit of Breaks out cringe preacher accent for Philadelphia Church.
[00:37:54.469 --> 00:37:58.670]  We're going to get to that first here in a moment.
[00:37:58.989 --> 00:38:04.449]  That clip of her doing her new preacher voice.
[00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:34.909]  She's an unveiled valley girl and black southerner and metro Detroit voices and Indian voices and no one really knows her real voice, but Scorched on sacred ground Kamala Harris heckled at Pennsylvania Church at reclaiming voting for her fulfills God's will a week and a half after being at a rally and people say Christ is king and
[00:38:34.909 --> 00:38:49.179]  she says you're at the wrong rally that's the one down the road the smaller one and then we got footage it was a little gymnasium she was in and Trump had a giant rally probably 30 times bigger so That's just how ridiculous this is.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:39:12.179]  Then we've got Tampon Tim running around saying that he's going to make sure that AOC becomes the Speaker of the House and he's playing video games with Kamala to show how real he is and then he comes out and says that Musk is prancing and skipping around on the stage like a pansy.
[00:39:12.559 --> 00:39:19.920]  I mean, this is from a guy when it comes to being light in the loafers and Skipping around and acting like a complete clown.
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:25.800]  When Musk does his hopping around and skipping, it's very enduring.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.539]  People like it.
[00:39:26.659 --> 00:39:31.190]  It's actually a super brainiac Nerd celebration.
[00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:36.610]  And then with walls, well, it's got the pedo flavor to it, doesn't it?
[00:39:37.289 --> 00:39:38.190]  It certainly does.
[00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:39.369]  I'm not saying he's a pedophile.
[00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:47.070]  I'm saying if I was going to cast a person to play a pedophile that drives around in an ice cream truck kidnapping children, it would be him, wouldn't it?
[00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:49.610]  Wouldn't you cast him as a pedophile for a movie?
[00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:52.610]  Oh, look, we're regular guys.
[00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:53.550]  We play football.
[00:39:53.849 --> 00:39:55.150]  We play video games.
[00:39:55.269 --> 00:39:56.230]  He's America's dad.
[00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:57.329]  He's the coach.
[00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:01.469]  What Alexander Soros said a few months ago, he goes, oh my god, coaches are really popular.
[00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:02.650]  This is our secret weapon.
[00:40:03.389 --> 00:40:04.809]  Coach walls, yeah.
[00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:07.090]  And tampon Tim, and yeah.
[00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:11.949]  And let's load shotgun shells in the butt of the rifle and talk about how we're a gun expert.
[00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:17.949]  I mean, this is just cringe on full...
[00:40:20.239 --> 00:40:20.719]  Display.
[00:40:20.719 --> 00:40:22.619]  Here is Kamala unveiling.
[00:40:23.099 --> 00:40:24.719]  And she looks so maniacal.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.300]  If you're a radio listener, you're going to miss it.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:32.579]  But, I mean, the face is just, she looks like a jack-o'-lantern that's that gasoline poured on it.
[00:40:32.619 --> 00:40:33.059]  Here it is.
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.579]  Weeping may endure for a night.
[00:40:38.179 --> 00:40:41.079]  But joy cometh in the morning.
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:49.679]  The path may seem hard, the work may seem heavy, but joy cometh in the morning.
[00:40:50.059 --> 00:40:53.079]  And church morning is on its way.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.820]  And there's longer versions of it, but I'm not gonna subject you.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.739]  I'm not gonna subject you to that.
[00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:09.210]  But since we talked about Walls and his skipping comment, let's play Walls talking about Elon Musk.
[00:41:11.269 --> 00:41:17.769]  And then let's play a little short compilation of the dancing fairy, Tampon Tim.
[00:41:19.269 --> 00:41:25.050]  Elon's on that stage, jumping around, skipping like a dipshit on these things.
[00:41:25.369 --> 00:41:26.250]  You know it.
[00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:28.030]  You are the dancer.
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.420]  Oh my God.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:12.360]  Can you imagine the system trying to install these completely revolting people?
[00:42:12.539 --> 00:42:17.260]  I mean, when I say Tim Walz is the creepiest man I've ever seen, it's hands down.
[00:42:17.599 --> 00:42:23.280]  And when I say Kamala comes off the most witch-like of any woman I've ever seen, I mean, she makes Hillary Clinton look likable.
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.860]  Where the hell did Satan find these people?
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.519]  But that's who the establishment is.
[00:42:30.619 --> 00:42:33.179]  They hijacked our country when America became the global empire.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:38.940]  70 years ago, and they're now three generations into these establishment globalists.
[00:42:39.099 --> 00:42:43.460]  You look at Blinken or Raskin or any of them, they're all given power by their parents.
[00:42:43.559 --> 00:42:47.980]  Hillary's dad was the second-in-command mob boss under Mayor Daley in Chicago.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:43:00.300]  I mean, Obama's parents and grandparents, CIA. I mean, it's all these self-appointed people that think if they trot out Bruce Springsteen, they'll say, Trump's not a real American.
[00:43:00.559 --> 00:43:02.219]  He doesn't know anything about America.
[00:43:03.289 --> 00:43:05.150]  The Democrats want to get rid of America.
[00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:06.510]  They hate the American flag.
[00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:12.130]  They have people bow or kneel in a disrespectful way during the National Anthem.
[00:43:12.889 --> 00:43:14.949]  They don't even want national sovereignty to exist.
[00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:15.849]  You know, they attacked Trump.
[00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:18.809]  He said yesterday, they want to ban your cows.
[00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:20.150]  I meant to cover that.
[00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.829]  Will you guys pull me the articles from yesterday's stacker?
[00:43:21.909 --> 00:43:24.650]  Just type in, should we ban beef for the environment?
[00:43:24.789 --> 00:43:25.969]  Or moves to ban beef.
[00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:28.289]  I mean, that's a well-known globalist tactic.
[00:43:28.469 --> 00:43:31.949]  They're getting rid of the cows in Ireland and in the Netherlands and everywhere else.
[00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:34.349]  And then Trump, they go, he's crazy.
[00:43:34.909 --> 00:43:36.329]  They're not trying to get rid of the cows.
[00:43:36.469 --> 00:43:37.329]  Well, the hell they're not.
[00:43:38.989 --> 00:43:41.630]  I mean, yeah, it sounds crazy that they're doing all this.
[00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:42.469]  I mean, it sounds crazy.
[00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:44.710]  She just says ban fracking and ban semi-autos.
[00:43:44.869 --> 00:43:45.510]  She did say it.
[00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:46.670]  Trump brings it up.
[00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:47.550]  She goes, ha, ha, ha.
[00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:51.389]  You're crazy.
[00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:53.809]  It's like one of those animatrons.
[00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.190]  Ha, ha.
[00:43:59.369 --> 00:44:12.849]  So, let's get to Elon Musk's short four and a half minute speech last night because at Madison Square Garden at the MAGA Square Garden event because I want to just spend a few minutes after it explaining what he's saying is totally true.
[00:44:12.969 --> 00:44:13.230]  Here it is.
[00:44:37.769 --> 00:44:38.449]  Alright!
[00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:41.750]  As you can see...
[00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:56.010]  I'm not just MAGA, I'm dark, gothic MAGA. Well, it's...
[00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:57.969]  The energy in this room is incredible.
[00:45:04.389 --> 00:45:06.409]  What a great group of people.
[00:45:07.489 --> 00:45:11.449]  I've only got one question for you and then I'm getting out of here because this is your stage.
[00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:13.489]  But we set up Doge.
[00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:14.250]  Yes.
[00:45:14.429 --> 00:45:22.690]  How much do you think we can rip out of this wasted 6.5 trillion dollar Harris-Biden budget?
[00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:25.429]  Well, I think we can do at least two trillion.
[00:45:25.989 --> 00:45:26.190]  Yeah!
[00:45:27.849 --> 00:45:28.369]  Yes.
[00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:29.289]  Two trillion.
[00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:33.489]  I mean, at the end of the day, you're being taxed.
[00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:34.849]  You're being taxed.
[00:45:35.389 --> 00:45:37.210]  All government spending is taxation.
[00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:43.590]  So whether it's direct taxation or all government spending, it either becomes inflation or it's direct taxation.
[00:45:43.929 --> 00:45:49.050]  Your money is being wasted and the Department of Government efficiency is going to fix that.
[00:45:53.409 --> 00:45:57.429]  We're going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook.
[00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.670]  America is not just going to be great.
[00:46:06.929 --> 00:46:10.130]  America is going to reach heights that it has never seen before.
[00:46:10.449 --> 00:46:13.269]  The future is going to be amazing!
[00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:23.730]  Viva!
[00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:24.670]  Viva!
[00:46:25.989 --> 00:46:26.590]  Viva!
[00:46:26.949 --> 00:46:27.550]  Viva!
[00:46:27.869 --> 00:46:28.469]  Viva!
[00:46:28.769 --> 00:46:29.369]  Viva!
[00:46:34.059 --> 00:46:35.000]  You guys are awesome.
[00:46:35.239 --> 00:46:38.420]  Honestly, this is like...
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:52.199]  I mean, this is the kind of positive energy that America is all about.
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.019]  Yeah.
[00:47:03.799 --> 00:47:13.199]  USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! Yes!
[00:47:17.039 --> 00:47:22.039]  Now, I have something I want to ask you to do, though.
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:27.900]  Because, obviously, we're somewhat preaching to the converted in this stadium.
[00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:35.559]  But there's a lot of people out there who We need to vote for President Trump.
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:39.380]  This is a real battle.
[00:47:39.559 --> 00:47:40.739]  This is a real election battle.
[00:47:41.239 --> 00:47:44.739]  So you need to get friends and family to vote.
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:45.920]  Make sure they vote.
[00:47:46.019 --> 00:47:46.940]  Vote early.
[00:47:47.199 --> 00:47:48.380]  This is important.
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.340]  We're going to be putting up a scorecard.
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:55.860]  An early vote scorecard, state by state, county by county.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.739]  What is the scorecard?
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.039]  Vote early.
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.219]  Vote now.
[00:48:09.929 --> 00:48:18.349]  Make the margin of victory so big that you know what can happen.
[00:48:30.449 --> 00:48:39.510]  Massive, overwhelming sweep of every swing state and even some of the states that people don't think are swing states.
[00:48:41.849 --> 00:48:43.510]  Massive crushing victory.
[00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:48.389]  Get everyone, friends, family, people on the street, put the signs up, put the hat on.
[00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:49.090]  Let's go!
[00:48:59.369 --> 00:49:07.489]  And with that, it is my honor to introduce the first lady, Melania Trump.
[00:49:11.449 --> 00:49:14.449]  I love how the media claims she doesn't like Trump and has left Trump.
[00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:15.510]  All that's lies.
[00:49:16.699 --> 00:49:17.719]  All that's lies.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:25.300]  We have a really interesting, informative talk show host, Candace Horbach, joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:31.059]  Then Del Bigtree of the Maha alliance with Trump and RLK Jr.
[00:49:31.199 --> 00:49:32.360]  instrumental in getting that done.
[00:49:33.099 --> 00:49:38.280]  We're going to talk about that, talk about the current stuff that's happening, talk about the future, how they get good people in and drain the swamp.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:45.000]  That's coming up with a deep dive with Del Bigtree in the third and fourth hour today.
[00:49:45.239 --> 00:49:47.380]  He's bringing a big list of things, a bunch of videos.
[00:49:47.559 --> 00:49:48.820]  You don't want to miss that as well.
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.380]  All right, getting into what...
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.539]  The Maverick was talking about there.
[00:49:55.219 --> 00:50:02.139]  Elon Musk, who's also funding Maha with all these great ads, you're seeing that we've been airing and playing and that are all over the place, that Musk has been posting.
[00:50:02.639 --> 00:50:05.579]  It's just the busy beavering that's going on around here.
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:11.719]  The income tax was set up in 1913.
[00:50:12.579 --> 00:50:20.300]  It is set up for social engineering, and since the 70s, none of the money from the income tax goes around the country.
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.780]  The debt is monetized, the Federal Reserve just issues the money.
[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:29.079]  And they give it to the private central banks, and they give it to the regional banks, they loan it out to you.
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:45.059]  But they give it to themselves up front, to the ESG scores, corporations that play ball with the globalists, They get unlimited money, and if you don't follow all the rules, you wonder why all these governments and all these corporations and all these countries have drag queen pedophile time,
[00:50:45.079 --> 00:50:52.440]  or you wonder why they put men and women's sports and why Bud Light did what it did, because they're paid to send that message.
[00:50:52.519 --> 00:50:55.900]  Why does every Hollywood movie have anti-family messages and the same propaganda?
[00:50:57.059 --> 00:51:00.119]  Why is the new Microsoft software AI for censorship coming out?
[00:51:00.179 --> 00:51:04.300]  I got an article right here where it's going to ban the word mother and father and thousands of other words.
[00:51:04.659 --> 00:51:07.179]  Because it's an ESG. It's a global plan.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.539]  BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street are all in by the same group.
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.280]  87% of world assets.
[00:51:12.599 --> 00:51:14.000]  They want to control you.
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:20.260]  Cheap energy, low taxes, getting rid of income taxes.
[00:51:22.059 --> 00:51:27.000]  Replacing it with tariffs will bring the jobs back.
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.000]  And again, because of monetization of debt, it's not even needed.
[00:51:30.159 --> 00:51:32.880]  It doesn't fund the country.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.559]  It is a destructive tax.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:38.159]  The income tax is in the Communist Manifesto.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:42.599]  The income tax didn't even affect the average American until the late 40s.
[00:51:42.719 --> 00:51:45.519]  It was only for the richest, and they had loopholes to get out of it.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.519]  The ultra-rich don't even really pay taxes.
[00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:50.789]  Must, to make an example, has paid tens of billions a year.
[00:51:50.969 --> 00:51:51.769]  It's just true.
[00:51:52.469 --> 00:51:55.510]  Google, these other big owners of these companies, they pay almost nothing.
[00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:56.789]  They've got it all set up.
[00:51:56.889 --> 00:52:00.809]  So while they lecture you all day how you need higher taxes to pay more, it runs nothing.
[00:52:00.809 --> 00:52:01.710]  It's all a scam.
[00:52:02.349 --> 00:52:05.429]  Globalism is about artificially making you poor for social control.
[00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:06.210]  It's feudalism.
[00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:07.170]  2.0.
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:09.400]  Alright, we're going to start next hour.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:10.980]  Getting our guest in here.
[00:52:11.039 --> 00:52:11.900]  You don't want to miss any of that.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.960]  I'm going to talk with her about the different plays, what the deep state's going to do, how we stop them, and so much more.
[00:52:18.219 --> 00:52:24.039]  Don't forget, in just two and a half days, we announce the winner at thealexjonesstore.com for the amazing truck and cash.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.860]  Plus, it supports the broadcast, amazing t-shirts, supplements, and more at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:29.000]  We're giving back to you.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:30.679]  It's your chance to sign up.
[00:52:31.249 --> 00:52:33.269]  So, I'm just asking you to keep me in the fight.
[00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:39.570]  And we got great t-shirts and incredible blow-you-away supplements and everything, and our great sponsor, yellowshownstore.com.
[00:52:39.909 --> 00:52:53.250]  There's a VIP section on there that I noticed was getting really a lot of traction, because I hadn't really, you know, because other folks on this, other folks that are great run this, the folks at Bigly, great patriot backers, total patriots, J-sexers, you name it.
[00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:56.469]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[00:52:56.530 --> 00:53:00.449]  So, when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[00:53:01.159 --> 00:53:11.280]  So if you're a member of the Alice Jones VIP Club at alicejonesstore.com forward slash VIP or there's just a big link at the top of the page, this is a critical time in our nation.
[00:53:11.659 --> 00:53:14.099]  We don't know what the future holds for the operation.
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:18.539]  The following information I'm about to relay to you is imperative so we can stay in touch.
[00:53:18.639 --> 00:53:21.739]  You can get great products and keep me on the air one way or the other along with the crew.
[00:53:22.039 --> 00:53:23.360]  Monthly member credits.
[00:53:23.739 --> 00:53:29.000]  Every month as a VIP member, you get $40 of free store credit.
[00:53:29.389 --> 00:53:30.429]  Did you hear what I just said?
[00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:30.869]  That's right.
[00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:34.570]  It's like money in your pocket with the best products on the planet.
[00:53:34.809 --> 00:53:38.889]  So you pay 30 bucks to be a VIP, and then you get 40 bucks free.
[00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.969]  That's $10 you make.
[00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:50.829]  All the Alex Jones products at the best prices, we're talking about 10 to even 40% off the already existing sales, so sometimes it becomes lost leaders, in the store 24-7, 365 days a year.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.760]  This is an unbeatable pricing you'll never find anywhere else.
[00:53:55.239 --> 00:54:03.519]  Automatic double entries in any of the giveaways, like the awesome turbo diesel super truck, $138,000 value, plus $1,000 cash.
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:06.880]  The winner of the sweepstakes we announced the 30th this month.
[00:54:07.239 --> 00:54:07.900]  You want to win?
[00:54:08.119 --> 00:54:09.039]  I know you do.
[00:54:09.239 --> 00:54:11.800]  Because the VIP will get double entries in every single giveaway.
[00:54:12.119 --> 00:54:14.440]  No effort, just double your chances just like that.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.659]  Exclusive VIP-only giveaways.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.579]  This is where it gets big, folks.
[00:54:18.719 --> 00:54:22.199]  VIP members get entered into their own exclusive giveaways every month.
[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:23.920]  Nobody else is allowed in these.
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.699]  Early access to products, promos, and giveaways.
[00:54:27.039 --> 00:54:31.980]  VIP members get first access to new products, promotions, and giveaways before anyone else.
[00:54:32.179 --> 00:54:33.219]  You're in the know.
[00:54:33.619 --> 00:54:35.440]  Oh, and did I mention orders over $99?
[00:54:36.019 --> 00:54:36.679]  Pre-shipping.
[00:54:36.699 --> 00:54:39.820]  We're not letting shipping costs slow you down.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.239]  It just goes on from there.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:48.360]  So, theallocshownstore.com forward slash VIP. Or just at the top of theallocshownstore.com, you see the VIP button.
[00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:50.690]  We're fighting the new world order.
[00:54:50.889 --> 00:54:52.570]  I don't have billionaire backers.
[00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:57.289]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[00:54:57.469 --> 00:54:58.710]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[00:55:01.219 --> 00:55:06.739]  It's up to you whether you want to back the number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:16.039]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[00:55:16.219 --> 00:55:23.300]  And I just don't know why I'm such a lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.440]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:28.400]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:29.639]  We've already...
[00:55:30.519 --> 00:55:31.599]  Just devastated them.
[00:55:31.739 --> 00:55:34.760]  I mean, world government, the dual orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[00:55:35.059 --> 00:55:36.320]  The whole world's turning against them.
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:37.900]  They're super dangerous.
[00:55:38.079 --> 00:55:40.619]  They're throwing the kitchen sink at us, trying to keep control.
[00:55:41.079 --> 00:55:51.300]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've understood, that I should let these Criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[00:55:51.599 --> 00:55:53.079]  So, again, I don't give up.
[00:55:53.219 --> 00:55:55.940]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:59.579]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:02.039]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[00:56:02.159 --> 00:56:03.519]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[00:56:03.739 --> 00:56:12.239]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over the social credit score and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:20.590]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:23.090]  I mean, it's just...
[00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:24.389]  This is a joke.
[00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:25.909]  This is ridiculous.
[00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:27.469]  We're changing the world.
[00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:30.449]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
[00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:37.969]  The globalist deep state just took their war on free speech and our very identities and our very freedoms to the next level.
[00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:51.639]  They have now introduced a lawsuit against me Where they literally claim they own my name, my social media, and me personally in violation of the 13th Amendment that we fought the Civil War over.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:56.579]  They're actually saying I'm an indentured servant, that I am a slave.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm always the canary in the coal mine.
[00:56:59.519 --> 00:57:00.840]  I am the test case.
[00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:03.260]  When they get through me, they're coming after you.
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:10.579]  They're not just saying they own me.
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:23.820]  They've also filed in federal court and also in the state court saying they own the name Alex Jones and that they own real Alex Jones on X. Now, the courts have all said you can't do things like that, but they're trying it.
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:30.900]  And if I don't aggressively battle them in the state and federal court, they will get a win if I don't challenge it.
[00:57:31.039 --> 00:57:33.760]  And then they'll be able to use that tactic on you as well.
[00:57:35.389 --> 00:57:41.650]  And in the words of President Trump, when that bullet grazed his ear, defiantly rising up and saying, fight, fight, fight!
[00:57:42.269 --> 00:57:43.269]  That's how we fight.
[00:57:43.449 --> 00:57:48.889]  In the information war, winning hearts and minds, and we're unstoppable if you simply decide to take action.
[00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:56.559]  So for all your word of mouth, all your prayers, and all your support over the years, I salute all of you and remind you that you are the Paul Revere's.
[00:57:56.719 --> 00:57:57.840]  You are the resistance.
[00:57:58.179 --> 00:57:59.659]  You are the people.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:02.699]  And I am so proud to have been working with all of you through the years.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:05.760]  And now the fight is entering the most intense part of the phase.
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:08.780]  So let's redouble our efforts and let's win this thing.
[00:58:09.099 --> 00:58:11.280]  Or we can roll over and be slaves to the New World Order.
[00:58:11.559 --> 00:58:14.739]  As for me, I'll quote Patrick Henry, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:17.980]  And I'll quote Colonel Travis the Alamo, victory or death.
[00:58:30.719 --> 00:58:36.300]  This is something that's next level and something I'm going to be talking a lot about, and I only bring you things that are game-changing.
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:41.190]  Out of everything we've ever put out, This is the Game Changer.
[00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:46.110]  If you think X2 and X3, Deep Earth Crystal Ionim are game changing, they are.
[00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:48.769]  Nobody ever put this out until I started 12 years ago.
[00:58:49.329 --> 00:58:54.250]  If you get a DEA license from Deep Earth Crystals on the ground, it goes right into your bloodstream, it does amazing things.
[00:58:55.429 --> 00:59:25.869]  The only thing you could say might be as good or maybe even better is sea moss and that's why it's been all the rage the last few years because it has no mercury in it unlike fish but it's bioavailable because it's in the special type of sea moss and it delivers all these super nutrients and the ring structures of how the nutrients are together bound with the iodine and other things does incredible things in the body So if you want energy,
[00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:34.829]  libido, stamina, immune system, your skin to look beautiful, if you think the iodine was great, this is next level.
[00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:36.889]  It's the ultimate CMOS gummies.
[00:59:36.969 --> 00:59:37.710]  It's a concentrate.
[00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:38.949]  It's super strong.
[00:59:38.949 --> 00:59:40.650]  It will blow you away.
[00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:44.869]  It'll take a week or so for the effects for you to start seeing, and I've taken it for a month.
[00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:45.889]  It's incredible.
[00:59:46.090 --> 00:59:48.369]  I've been taking these for over a month.
[00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:52.309]  It's one of the reasons that I'm so much healthier and look so much better.
[00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:56.550]  And now it's available to you exclusively at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:58.949]  There's a lot of CMOS out there and a lot of us great.

[01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:26.809]  CMOS is a natural source of iodine in a key type, which is in the plant, so it goes differently into the body, which is essential for maintaining healthy thyroid function, helping regulate your metabolism and hormone production.
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:31.900]  Rich in nutrients that are in a just super organic bioavailable form.
[01:00:32.099 --> 01:00:33.900]  It all goes together.
[01:00:34.059 --> 01:00:34.400]  It's next level.
[01:00:35.079 --> 01:00:45.079]  Sea moss is packed with vitamins and minerals like iodine, iron, magnesium, potassium, vitamins A, C, and K. These nutrients support overall health, including immune function and energy levels.
[01:00:45.619 --> 01:00:47.599]  And so you need to get it.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:48.579]  It's next level.
[01:00:49.059 --> 01:00:51.780]  Ultimate Sea Moss, the latest supplement.
[01:00:54.159 --> 01:01:02.780]  With bladder, rack, and burdock root, and it is just the ultimate formula.
[01:01:03.839 --> 01:01:06.099]  Nobody has got something at this quality.
[01:01:06.519 --> 01:01:10.440]  This is the best from the top manufacturer that lets us private label it.
[01:01:10.679 --> 01:01:12.000]  There's only one other place to get it.
[01:01:12.199 --> 01:01:13.320]  There's hundreds of brands of this.
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:14.039]  This is the best.
[01:01:14.239 --> 01:01:17.039]  This is the best at thealexjohnstore.com.
[01:01:17.139 --> 01:01:19.440]  It'll blow you away and it keeps us on air one way or another.
[01:01:19.639 --> 01:01:21.199]  Go down to thealexjohnstore.com.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.559]  There's some new t-shirts there as well.
[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:24.760]  Be sure to check those out at thealexjohnstore.com.
[01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:34.960]  Well, I'd already seen her show some and some of her viral videos, and then Chase went on her show, and I really thought it was informative.
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.619]  So I wanted to get Candace Horbach on the show.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:44.360]  She's a popular talk show host and also a mother, and also I would think it's fair to say a Trump supporter, but she also likes RFK Jr.
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:46.519]  and the whole Maha movement and what's happening.
[01:01:46.639 --> 01:01:48.119]  So I thought we'd get her in studio.
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:55.719]  With us as part of our election coverage here, Del Bigtree of the Maha Movement, who heads it up with RFK Jr.
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:58.519]  and is working closely with Elon Musk with all these great ads you've been seeing.
[01:01:58.719 --> 01:02:01.260]  He'll be with us in studio next hour.
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:02.880]  But Candice, great to have you here.
[01:02:03.079 --> 01:02:03.860]  Thank you for having me.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:04.539]  I'm so excited.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.179]  People can find you.
[01:02:06.619 --> 01:02:07.980]  What's the best places to find you?
[01:02:08.519 --> 01:02:09.280]  Chattingwithcandice.com.
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:11.400]  It has all my podcasts, socials, all that good stuff.
[01:02:12.219 --> 01:02:13.119]  Chattingwithcandice.com.
[01:02:13.239 --> 01:02:16.900]  They can also find you on X. So people should definitely follow you there.
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:17.960]  Thank you.
[01:02:18.639 --> 01:02:19.059]  Wow.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:25.920]  How would you describe your political awakening and just where America and the world is right now?
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.320]  It's a huge political realignment.
[01:02:27.679 --> 01:02:29.599]  The establishment admits they know that.
[01:02:29.719 --> 01:02:31.780]  I don't know if you saw Tucker's speech yesterday and some of the others.
[01:02:32.239 --> 01:02:38.199]  Mass Square Garden, I know you were at the Rescue Republic event a few weeks ago up in D.C. How would you describe this moment in history?
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:45.760]  I think it's this weird convergence of all of these really unique thought leaders that you wouldn't see typically coming together.
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:50.780]  When RFK decided to join Trump's campaign, I think that that set everything on fire.
[01:02:51.019 --> 01:02:54.079]  A lot of people would try to dismiss Trump very easily.
[01:02:54.079 --> 01:02:56.139]  They said that they didn't like his personality.
[01:02:56.139 --> 01:03:11.809]  But when you talk to moms and you talk to women and you see what they're doing in the schools, what they're feeding our kids, it's really easy to get behind something that is like, let's stop Let's stop giving parents choice over what vaccines you're gonna put in your child's body before you send them to school.
[01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:17.550]  And let's maybe talk about having a closed border so that we can feel safe in our homes and in our state.
[01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:26.110]  So I think that this, seeing RFK, seeing Tulsi, seeing all of these different-minded people going behind Trump is really creating a movement we haven't seen before.
[01:03:26.849 --> 01:03:28.449]  Tucker made that point last night.
[01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:31.289]  It's surreal to have Tulsi Gabbards and RFK Jr.
[01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:37.769]  and Hulk Hogan and Elon Musk and everybody there saying, we don't like the globalists.
[01:03:37.849 --> 01:03:39.130]  We don't like this establishment.
[01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:41.210]  It's literally at war with the people.
[01:03:41.409 --> 01:03:44.309]  And when I go on the street, I see almost nothing but Trump support.
[01:03:44.489 --> 01:03:48.449]  And I've been supporting him since he ran almost 10 years ago.
[01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:55.449]  And it was always big, but I mean, now, I'm just seeing landslide all over the place despite all the fraud.
[01:03:55.550 --> 01:03:56.530]  I think it's gonna be mitigated.
[01:03:56.889 --> 01:03:58.110]  What are you seeing on the ground?
[01:03:58.369 --> 01:03:59.670]  So I'm in North Carolina.
[01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:01.369]  I really hope that you're right.
[01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:05.289]  I went to do early voting, and when I went, it seemed pretty blue.
[01:04:05.949 --> 01:04:11.510]  But then I talked to some friends that voted later on in the day and a couple days later, and they said it was just all Trump.
[01:04:11.769 --> 01:04:12.849]  So I have no idea.
[01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:18.269]  All the signs that I see in my neighborhood are all for Trump, so I'm hoping that that's the case.
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.239]  Do you live in like a blue town or city?
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:22.659]  We're a flip city.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:27.079]  So like we've, I think that it went Obama, Trump, and then Biden.
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.539]  So we'll see what happens.
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:29.639]  I'm in Wilmington.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.519]  So North Carolina in general, I feel like it tends to maybe be a little bit more blue, but I think it's gonna go red.
[01:04:35.199 --> 01:04:36.280]  I mean, you lived there.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.340]  How bad was the hurricane?
[01:04:38.179 --> 01:04:39.039]  I'm at the beach.
[01:04:39.239 --> 01:04:42.199]  So thankfully we didn't get hit, but Asheville is, it's wrecked.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:43.519]  I don't know if it'll ever be the same.
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:44.539]  Wow.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:47.440]  And then FEMA's response, what's your take on that?
[01:04:48.539 --> 01:04:48.940]  Insane.
[01:04:49.099 --> 01:04:58.519]  And then when you see the Harris signs in North Carolina, what I don't understand is when you see how they responded to North Carolinians, and they said, well, you just lost your entire livelihood.
[01:04:58.519 --> 01:05:01.000]  Some people have had this land for hundreds of years.
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:02.980]  There's no power.
[01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:03.980]  There's no water.
[01:05:04.139 --> 01:05:04.940]  There's nowhere to stay.
[01:05:05.059 --> 01:05:09.500]  But hey, if you can somehow find a computer, you can apply, maybe get approved for $750.
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:10.960]  That is a joke.
[01:05:11.139 --> 01:05:12.679]  It's a joke, and it took weeks.
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:17.980]  So I don't understand how anyone in North Carolina can sleep at night and have a Harris sign in their yard.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.960]  I love how the left keeps claiming they are the rebels and we're the establishment.
[01:05:24.019 --> 01:05:26.639]  I want to show viewers an overshot of this.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:29.639]  Here are graphs of the current corporate donations.
[01:05:30.139 --> 01:05:31.579]  Trump's average donation is less than $50.
[01:05:32.079 --> 01:05:38.400]  But you can see right here the big corporations who they're giving to here.
[01:05:38.539 --> 01:05:40.380]  Here's a closer shot of it.
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.960]  It's over 90% of the big corporate money.
[01:05:43.599 --> 01:05:44.659]  Is going to Harris.
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.780]  And so right there is the Maverick, just that alone.
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:49.059]  He is not the establishment.
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:51.320]  He is not selling out the establishment.
[01:05:52.019 --> 01:05:55.480]  There are a lot of billionaires, people that were attacking him that are now going neutral.
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:06:00.920]  A bunch of newspapers are refusing to endorse Kamala because they smell defeat.
[01:06:02.659 --> 01:06:05.039]  What are you predicting is going to happen in seven days?
[01:06:05.739 --> 01:06:06.739]  I think Trump wins.
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:09.860]  And I think that they're gonna somehow try to say that it wasn't legitimate.
[01:06:10.119 --> 01:06:17.760]  And there were some clips of Kamala saying they're ready, they have their attorneys on speed dial, and that for some reason she doesn't win, that they're gonna look into it.
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:24.559]  And then I don't understand how that's not being ridiculed in the same way when Trump said this might not have been a legitimate election.
[01:06:24.559 --> 01:06:27.639]  And maybe there was some interference, but she's allowed to have those same uncertainties.
[01:06:27.679 --> 01:06:29.519]  It just seems a little bit hypocritical.
[01:06:29.849 --> 01:06:30.230]  Well, that's right.
[01:06:30.369 --> 01:06:32.570]  And Jamie Raskin is one of their top strategists, the congressman.
[01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:35.110]  He said in a bunch of interviews, we're not going to certify it.
[01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:38.849]  And that would be Kamala as the VP not certifying it.
[01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:40.349]  Yeah, interesting.
[01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:45.929]  Reminds me of Arizona where the lady running for governor was the head of elections and certified her own election.
[01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:47.489]  Seems legitimate.
[01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:52.010]  But then they always say that he's the fascist and that he's gonna be the dictator.
[01:06:52.170 --> 01:06:54.050]  But everything, she hasn't even had a single vote.
[01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:56.449]  She just took the nominee for the Democratic Party.
[01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:59.750]  So how, it just, I don't understand the cognitive dissonance that's happening.
[01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.829]  How would you describe Kamala Harris?
[01:07:04.769 --> 01:07:06.110]  She's got a great laugh.
[01:07:08.469 --> 01:07:09.269]  Great personality.
[01:07:09.329 --> 01:07:10.230]  She's very quick.
[01:07:10.389 --> 01:07:12.409]  No, I think that she's simply a puppet.
[01:07:12.409 --> 01:07:13.710]  She's doing what she's told.
[01:07:13.869 --> 01:07:16.309]  I think she's given some talking points before she goes out.
[01:07:16.409 --> 01:07:18.010]  Sometimes she hits it, sometimes she doesn't.
[01:07:18.090 --> 01:07:20.449]  But I think she's very much just someone there to play ball.
[01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:22.590]  I agree.
[01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:27.949]  Why do you think the system would pick two such loathsome people?
[01:07:28.090 --> 01:07:31.130]  I mean, it's hard to find people more creepy than her and Tim Walz.
[01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:31.949]  I mean, that's quite a duo.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.159]  I was really surprised by that pick.
[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:35.320]  I'm like, he's not likable.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:41.280]  And then I was talking to someone and they said that typically when you have the VP debate, it doesn't really move the needle at all.
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:50.860]  But for the first time, maybe ever, that it made a significant difference when you had Vance and Walls go head to head because you just see the insanity there.
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:53.300]  Well, my mother's a very smart person.
[01:07:53.599 --> 01:07:56.199]  She's a history degree, but that's what she's into.
[01:07:56.699 --> 01:07:59.940]  She's always very kind, very Christian, doesn't really talk bad about people.
[01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:14.059]  I was over there last night with some of my younger children and visiting with her, and we're having a little Halloween thing, a little dinner, and she just said, he is the most disgusting man I've ever seen She never talks about this.
[01:08:14.099 --> 01:08:17.460]  She goes, I would become a lesbian before I would have anything.
[01:08:17.619 --> 01:08:18.899]  I was like, whoa, Mom.
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:19.760]  She goes, I hate him.
[01:08:19.819 --> 01:08:20.659]  He's so gross.
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:23.159]  I'm like, my mom's 76 years old.
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:24.560]  I was like, wow, Mom.
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:26.420]  That's a real quote.
[01:08:26.899 --> 01:08:27.800]  That's amazing.
[01:08:28.699 --> 01:08:30.460]  What would elicit something like that?
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.079]  I mean, look at the guy.
[01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:32.899]  He just...
[01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:34.939]  He oozes creepiness.
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.020]  Yeah, he really does.
[01:08:36.239 --> 01:08:39.800]  And then what was the thing with the tampons and the women's bathroom that everyone's talking about?
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:40.359]  The boys' bathrooms.
[01:08:40.579 --> 01:08:41.720]  Yeah, the boys' bathrooms.
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:44.279]  So he's just like, that's one of his talking points?
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:46.239]  No, he had a law put in there.
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:46.659]  Oh.
[01:08:46.859 --> 01:08:49.520]  And then he had the police stand out and burn down half the state.
[01:08:49.939 --> 01:08:52.479]  And then he's just, everything about him is a lie, too.
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.180]  Every award he got, it's all a lie.
[01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:55.739]  And he's a communist Chinese agent.
[01:08:56.199 --> 01:08:56.779]  He's a what?
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.060]  A communist Chinese agent.
[01:08:58.239 --> 01:08:58.439]  Okay.
[01:08:58.739 --> 01:09:00.760]  Well, yeah, so let's maybe not vote for that, people.
[01:09:02.119 --> 01:09:03.699]  So I could ask you a million questions.
[01:09:03.859 --> 01:09:04.720]  I've seen your talk shows.
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:05.640]  It's very, very good.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.399]  Amazing topics.
[01:09:07.579 --> 01:09:08.399]  I've watched it quite a bit.
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:13.859]  I've got a hundred questions here for you, Candace, but front and center, what's on your radar?
[01:09:14.079 --> 01:09:15.659]  And I agree with you.
[01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:20.979]  No one can underestimate the power of RFK Jr., how smart he is, the support he had.
[01:09:22.119 --> 01:09:25.180]  Trump was going to win, but he might not have been able to override the fraud.
[01:09:25.659 --> 01:09:27.720]  The Kennedy thing is the game changer.
[01:09:28.239 --> 01:09:32.319]  I think so too, because there were so many people that were, I think most people exist in the middle.
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:40.600]  Everything that gets all of the attention, especially online, it's like the extreme just rhetoric that everyone wants to rage bait.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.420]  But most people exist in the middle.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:45.960]  Most people wanna have peace, safety, security, sovereignty.
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:53.090]  And if you have someone like RFK that can just present Just like a sound reality to this and say, hey, I'm supporting this man.
[01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:54.270]  He's clearly not what you think.
[01:09:54.409 --> 01:09:57.189]  I think people get mischaracterized a ton in the public.
[01:09:57.310 --> 01:09:59.109]  I think you're one of those people as well, right?
[01:09:59.229 --> 01:10:02.270]  So you have all of this machine essentially going against you.
[01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:07.989]  And the same machine's going against RFK, but he is a little bit softer, a little bit more digestible for some people.
[01:10:08.189 --> 01:10:15.289]  So what I am trying to get across, especially with my new segment that I'm doing, which is like a weekly roundup, is just keeping people sovereign.
[01:10:15.659 --> 01:10:18.739]  And you have the right to protect yourself, your family.
[01:10:18.939 --> 01:10:21.779]  You have the right to say that my food shouldn't be poisoned anymore.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.880]  You have the right to say that anyone in this country should be here legally.
[01:10:26.199 --> 01:10:29.300]  And that doesn't make you anti-immigration at all.
[01:10:29.399 --> 01:10:31.680]  I think immigrants are amazing, but just do it the right way.
[01:10:31.859 --> 01:10:38.140]  So just having people take their emotions out of it, because I think that is leading a lot of decisions and has been for the last four years.
[01:10:38.239 --> 01:10:39.699]  And just say, look at the actual facts.
[01:10:39.699 --> 01:10:41.800]  And how has the country been for the last four years?
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:42.699]  Are you happy?
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:43.979]  Can you afford your groceries?
[01:10:44.079 --> 01:10:45.420]  It's insane out there right now.
[01:10:45.649 --> 01:10:51.109]  And going back to RFK Jr., I'm into a meritocracy, so...
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.579]  Most of Kennedy's, it's just globalist trash.
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:09.000]  But he's gone against the grain, and he has a 40-year history plus of real environmental activism, like toxic waste dumps and things like that, and stopping and cleaning up major rivers, and really standing up for health freedom, medical freedom.
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:14.439]  And he's just really an amazing, amazing person and has incredible integrity.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:20.640]  And the fact that he would endorse Trump for people that were believing in propaganda, it made them look twice at Trump and find out they've been lied to.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:26.439]  Yeah, and then obviously World War Three should probably be the most pressing issue that we're voting on.
[01:11:26.579 --> 01:11:33.659]  And it kind of blows my mind that abortion is still a main talking point of the left because there will be no babies if we go into nuclear war.
[01:11:33.779 --> 01:11:40.140]  So who is the person that is championing and spending billions and billions of dollars to keep these forever wars going?
[01:11:40.319 --> 01:11:44.960]  And then who is the one that had an interview And they said, do you support Russia or do you support Ukraine?
[01:11:45.039 --> 01:11:47.300]  And he's like, I support people to stop dying.
[01:11:47.319 --> 01:11:48.819]  I want to see soldiers to stop dying.
[01:11:48.819 --> 01:11:52.159]  So I think that we should actually just delegate, have a conversation with Putin.
[01:11:52.199 --> 01:11:53.779]  And they're like, you support Russia.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:58.260]  It's like, no, he just doesn't want to send young men off to die a war that is not ours.
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:58.960]  Absolutely.
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:01.159]  Plus the West in the last 14 years started that war.
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:01.500]  Yeah.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.659]  I mean, if the Russians were on our doorstep, we'd be doing the same thing.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:05.159]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:12.119]  Heaven forbid they are able to steal the election.
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:14.739]  They're going to try to stir up violence and claim Republicans did it.
[01:12:14.819 --> 01:12:16.500]  I think Republicans are smart enough not to do that.
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:17.420]  It'll be a pyrrhic victory.
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.539]  If they do that, it'll defeat the globalists even faster.
[01:12:19.939 --> 01:12:21.239]  Trump's going to be handed a mess.
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:23.960]  So I still want him to win.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.060]  I want to defeat the fraud.
[01:12:25.899 --> 01:12:27.300]  And it's a vindication story.
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.939]  But at the same time, what are your concerns if they're able to steal it?
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.560]  That it might be the last election.
[01:12:34.739 --> 01:12:37.340]  I know that might sound hyperbolic to a lot of people.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.939]  But to me, what Trump represents is anti-establishment.
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:43.359]  And it's what we were kind of founded on.
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:44.960]  Anyone should be able to run for president.
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:46.500]  You shouldn't be a career politician.
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:50.739]  Anyone should be able to throw their hat in the ring and make a case and see if the American people support them.
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:13:00.100]  And what I see happening is he was just so anti-establishment and so irritating to the powers that be that they're doing everything that they can to stop him.
[01:13:00.279 --> 01:13:03.319]  What gives me hope, though, is how much they're still trying.
[01:13:03.579 --> 01:13:09.159]  So to me, that says that there's still a lot of power in that position in D.C. So I'm hoping, obviously, that he wins.
[01:13:09.239 --> 01:13:12.479]  But if he doesn't, it's like, okay, well, now use that donation sheet, right?
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.520]  Like the machine just won.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.079]  And then how do you go back from there?
[01:13:16.119 --> 01:13:17.840]  And I'll show that again for TV viewers.
[01:13:18.119 --> 01:13:23.659]  Over 90% of major corporate donations to Kamala Wall's campaign.
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.199]  And you just look at Trump.
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:29.260]  I mean, it is night and day right there.
[01:13:29.539 --> 01:13:33.779]  And of course, the mad guys still give a little to Trump because that's their claim entryway.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:34.979]  That's the way politics works.
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:37.840]  But that is just them as a backup plan.
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.800]  And the truth is, donations don't work on Trump.
[01:13:41.439 --> 01:13:43.600]  You don't get Trump's support by a corporate donation.
[01:13:44.039 --> 01:13:45.439]  That's another reason the money's not there.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.600]  No, that makes a lot of sense.
[01:13:47.699 --> 01:13:52.220]  And it's also infuriating that money has such an influence on most people who you're voting for.
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:57.199]  What Google thinks and who Google wants should have nothing to do with who the president is.
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:59.279]  Because Google doesn't represent the American people.
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:10.359]  And as Professor Epstein testified eight years ago and four years ago on this show, and they've done the breakdowns, Google will not show you pro-Trump information, nothing but positive.
[01:14:10.359 --> 01:14:14.100]  They won't show you local Republican races, and they won't send out voting reminders.
[01:14:14.439 --> 01:14:18.779]  Even if you don't ask for it, if you're a Democrat, you get the voting reminders, but they don't send them out to Republicans.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:19.859]  That's election meddling right there.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:21.239]  They have over 90% of search results.
[01:14:21.939 --> 01:14:24.479]  Yeah, it was right after the assassination attempt.
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.880]  And then when you did that, it was all the Reagan that was coming up.
[01:14:26.979 --> 01:14:29.840]  And you're like, clearly no one is trying to look at Ronald Reagan right now.
[01:14:29.939 --> 01:14:34.520]  Why are you trying to dampen this monumental event that could have changed the world?
[01:14:34.890 --> 01:14:37.250]  What would have happened if they had killed Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania?
[01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:38.529]  Oh my gosh.
[01:14:38.689 --> 01:14:39.989]  I think absolute chaos.
[01:14:40.329 --> 01:14:43.109]  And then they would have still, they probably would have taken all of the guns.
[01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:44.949]  It would have been the reason that they needed, right?
[01:14:45.029 --> 01:14:50.729]  Like, oh, look at a presidential candidate just got killed in plain sight, so we're going to take all of the guns back.
[01:14:51.069 --> 01:14:56.350]  I think you would have seen a huge restriction on personal freedoms, and they would have done it under the guise of safety, as it always is.
[01:14:57.069 --> 01:15:01.069]  And we would have just put Kamala in, because now we're in, what do you call it?
[01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:03.989]  Like a martial law kind of situation.
[01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:08.630]  So again, it's for your best interest, but you just lost all of your privileges as an American citizen.
[01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:13.369]  I want to talk about the great awakening effect and studying the globalist.
[01:15:13.890 --> 01:15:19.250]  The left is there to try to intimidate people and try to say, we're the moral authority.
[01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:24.250]  If you don't support all of our political views, you're a Nazi, you're a devil, you're all these things.
[01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:27.369]  And they thought they'd intimidated the American people.
[01:15:27.529 --> 01:15:30.289]  But in my research, most Americans were asleep.
[01:15:31.039 --> 01:15:34.640]  Now, once people are awakening and they're being bullied, it's not having the desired effect.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:43.079]  I want to play the Eddie Bravo clip that's on the list that I played last night because I had dinner with him after he did JRE. Saturday, he called me after it, and we went and got dinner.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.439]  And he was saying all this great stuff.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.520]  I said, you got to say that on camera because we talk a lot about it.
[01:15:48.539 --> 01:15:49.699]  We're both good friends with Joe Rogan.
[01:15:49.939 --> 01:15:51.199]  So we know the inside baseball.
[01:15:51.319 --> 01:15:52.060]  And I said this about...
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:58.800]  Three years ago, I said, the left trying to bully Rogan and going after him is only going to make him get more populous, more hardcore.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:07.220]  And now, on air and behind the scenes, Joe is as wake as I am, super hardcore, but he's doing it in his way to be nonpartisan so that he can reach more people on the left.
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:08.880]  And he's a huge game changer.
[01:16:10.170 --> 01:16:11.069]  Bigger than Joe Rogan.
[01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:16.890]  Look at Elon Musk, how they took his son and sterilized him, how his brother almost died from the shot.
[01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:18.250]  A bunch of his employees got sick.
[01:16:18.609 --> 01:16:20.630]  Then he just bought X to have some freedom of speech.
[01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:21.430]  They attacked him.
[01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:22.590]  George Soros came after him.
[01:16:22.710 --> 01:16:25.989]  And then Elon Musk said, hey, you're going to try to destroy me because I allow free speech?
[01:16:26.109 --> 01:16:27.010]  Go fuck yourselves.
[01:16:27.449 --> 01:16:29.949]  So we really reached that tipping point.
[01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:33.229]  And historically, once you do that, it's not just here, it's all over the world.
[01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:35.489]  There's no putting the genie back in the bottle.
[01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:37.529]  And that's why I tell the globalists, you need to give up.
[01:16:38.079 --> 01:16:42.699]  You need to capitulate, but instead they want to start World War III, start a race war, chival war.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:47.119]  I mean, they're openly pushing that, and it looks like they may not, you know, live to fight another day.
[01:16:47.199 --> 01:16:49.159]  It looks like they're going to go ahead and push all the way over the top.
[01:16:49.659 --> 01:16:51.140]  My question is, how do we respond to that?
[01:16:51.199 --> 01:16:53.119]  I'll ask you that question, Candice, in a moment, but here's the clip.
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.119]  Teddy Bravo?
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:56.699]  Yo, I don't know nothing.
[01:16:57.079 --> 01:16:59.119]  I love Kamala and Walsh.
[01:16:59.119 --> 01:17:04.020]  I'm going for Kamala and Walsh because they have such great policies.
[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:05.819]  Hey, you were just on the JRE tonight.
[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:06.560]  Yes.
[01:17:06.699 --> 01:17:09.000]  And we were talking about how they tried to harass me and make me quit at work.
[01:17:09.619 --> 01:17:10.420]  Russell Brand didn't work.
[01:17:10.539 --> 01:17:12.279]  And also they went after Joe and it did what?
[01:17:13.479 --> 01:17:14.880]  They turned him into a monster.
[01:17:15.279 --> 01:17:17.560]  Every time they go after somebody, it doesn't work.
[01:17:17.699 --> 01:17:18.840]  They went after you like a...
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.399]  You're still yipping in the yapping every day.
[01:17:23.319 --> 01:17:31.699]  At one point, at some point, they got to figure out, like, damn, if we go after these guys, it just makes them even worse.
[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:34.300]  So they got strategy.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:37.560]  They think we're like the lawyers and the scum that work for them.
[01:17:37.779 --> 01:17:39.699]  They start messing with real red-blooded people.
[01:17:39.699 --> 01:17:40.520]  It doesn't work that way.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.880]  Hey listen, I'm just trying to live my life.
[01:17:45.159 --> 01:17:48.979]  I hope Kamala has a good Christmas.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:56.239]  And Tim Walz, Tampon Tim, I hope he has a fabulous holiday.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:00.699]  They did mess with Joe.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.920]  When he wasn't even going after him, that didn't work too well.
[01:18:03.619 --> 01:18:05.739]  Every time they go after somebody, it doesn't work out.
[01:18:05.899 --> 01:18:07.279]  They went after Russell Brand, what happened?
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:09.800]  They went after Elon Musk, tried to bully him three years ago.
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:10.420]  How'd that turn out?
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.539]  That didn't turn out too good.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.239]  Hey, who is running this?
[01:18:13.579 --> 01:18:15.640]  Yo, we gotta stop going after these.
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:17.359]  It just makes them into monsters.
[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:19.699]  Right?
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:20.359]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:21.619]  Hey, look at you.
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:25.699]  They went after you harder than anybody, and you weren't shutting the up.
[01:18:25.979 --> 01:18:27.020]  You're louder than ever.
[01:18:27.539 --> 01:18:29.100]  Yeah, we reached about 30 million people there now.
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:30.000]  Yeah, and you're bigger than ever.
[01:18:30.569 --> 01:18:34.229]  Like at some point you would think like, okay, we got to rethink this.
[01:18:35.109 --> 01:18:36.029]  What's your take on this?
[01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:41.789]  I think that the power goes to the people, and that they try to silence people, and it just backfires.
[01:18:42.069 --> 01:18:44.449]  And more people come together, and more people come to Trump.
[01:18:44.710 --> 01:18:47.050]  You're making a good point about how it's an illusion of power.
[01:18:47.229 --> 01:18:49.069]  They only have the illusion of control, right?
[01:18:49.210 --> 01:18:52.770]  And once that illusion is gone, then the real power comes back to the people.
[01:18:52.890 --> 01:18:54.729]  There's way more of us than there is of them.
[01:18:54.949 --> 01:18:57.649]  And when we all collectively come together, we can destroy them.
[01:18:58.069 --> 01:18:58.789]  And we are.
[01:18:59.029 --> 01:18:59.869]  It's a great awakening.
[01:19:00.029 --> 01:19:00.850]  It's a great awakening.
[01:19:01.050 --> 01:19:01.750]  And we're winning.
[01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:02.609]  Eddie?
[01:19:03.319 --> 01:19:03.880]  Anything else?
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:05.520]  It is a great awakening.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:11.199]  Candace Horbach, responding to the bullying, do you agree with my statement or can you elaborate on it?
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:16.819]  Why do they keep attacking people thinking that'll make them bow?
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:17.359]  It's not working.
[01:19:17.890 --> 01:19:23.949]  I think that most people in legacy media, they think that they can just tell people what to think.
[01:19:24.090 --> 01:19:28.329]  And like you said, I think a lot of people were asleep, but they're waking up, so their old tactics aren't working anymore.
[01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:33.810]  It was just like, I'm just gonna tell you that this person is bad, or this person is a liar, and then you shouldn't ask any questions.
[01:19:33.829 --> 01:19:36.829]  Just take what I'm saying at face value and be like a good little dog.
[01:19:36.989 --> 01:19:40.369]  And I think people are now seeing the realities of their grocery bills.
[01:19:40.569 --> 01:19:48.090]  Or you have your three-year-old going to school and then they give you the reading list and you're like, Why am I learning that John was always Jane at three years old?
[01:19:48.270 --> 01:19:49.350]  That doesn't make any sense.
[01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:52.090]  And that's actually happening because that's happening in my son's school.
[01:19:52.210 --> 01:19:54.829]  So I have to actively pull him out on DEI days.
[01:19:54.949 --> 01:19:55.689]  And he's four.
[01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:57.069]  So it is bummer.
[01:19:57.069 --> 01:20:01.890]  And then when they get confused, they secretly don't tell the parents and fast track them for sterilization.
[01:20:02.050 --> 01:20:03.409]  Tell us about the school and your son.
[01:20:03.619 --> 01:20:07.020]  Okay, so it's a private school and I think those tend to actually be worse.
[01:20:07.119 --> 01:20:09.859]  So you have to be so diligent, ask for the reading materials.
[01:20:09.859 --> 01:20:12.300]  If they have a DEI program, ask what they're teaching.
[01:20:12.859 --> 01:20:19.399]  And even then, I had them lie to me in a conference that we had because I was like, I need to know all the materials that you're gonna be showing my son.
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.819]  And they're like, oh, we're just trying to teach them inclusivity, be nice to other people.
[01:20:22.979 --> 01:20:24.199]  Some foods smell different, right?
[01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:25.439]  And I was like, oh, that sounds good.
[01:20:25.619 --> 01:20:28.840]  And then I talked to a different mom and she sent me the actual reading list.
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:29.140]  Wow.
[01:20:29.319 --> 01:20:36.319]  And it was a lot of pride books, a lot of gay family books, a lot of transitioning at a very young age book.
[01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:45.420]  And to me, that is insane, because it's like, unless you're gonna explain all of the complexities, which you absolutely should not to a 3, 4, 5, any child that's not yours- It's designed to confuse them.
[01:20:45.569 --> 01:20:45.789]  Right.
[01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:52.529]  You have all of this, like, neurochemistry that's changing, their brains are pruning, and then you're going to say, hey, you can actually be a unicorn if you want.
[01:20:52.569 --> 01:20:53.529]  That makes no sense.
[01:20:53.649 --> 01:20:57.310]  That's how you create a mentally ill person with serious mental problems.
[01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:58.970]  For sure, too many choices, right?
[01:20:59.029 --> 01:21:05.289]  You overwhelm them with things, and then they lose their touch of reality, which they don't already have because they're a child.
[01:21:05.619 --> 01:21:07.960]  And let's let this sink in, because it comes out in the news.
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:09.079]  We've had parents on about it.
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:10.439]  Every state does it.
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:13.500]  Some of the most elite private schools are the worst, not just public schools.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:16.479]  And they keep it secret from the parents.
[01:21:16.739 --> 01:21:20.680]  And then as the child gets older, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, they put them in a secret file.
[01:21:20.899 --> 01:21:22.640]  They tell the kid, don't tell your parents.
[01:21:22.819 --> 01:21:23.960]  It's literally a cult.
[01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:28.520]  And the states like Oregon passed laws to take children from parents if they don't agree with it.
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:33.000]  And now the Biden administration actually federally has an initiative to do that.
[01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:36.850]  Which is insane because their argument is that, sorry, I have to do that.
[01:21:37.050 --> 01:21:41.529]  Their argument is that if you tell the parent, the parent is gonna start abusing the child.
[01:21:41.649 --> 01:21:45.649]  Well, if you have any indication to believe that that parent is abusive, you should have already reported the parent.
[01:21:45.829 --> 01:21:52.270]  So if the real issue is safety or alleged issue of safety, then you're also not doing your job because you didn't make that call beforehand.
[01:21:52.449 --> 01:21:55.890]  So that's not your job to say, should they tell the parent or not?
[01:21:55.949 --> 01:21:56.689]  That's not your child.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:57.680]  It's grooming.
[01:21:58.199 --> 01:22:03.579]  It's a tab of stock MI6 CIA program to break down the family and society.
[01:22:03.579 --> 01:22:08.500]  The new Microsoft AI censorship tool coming out will ban the name mother and father.
[01:22:08.699 --> 01:22:09.479]  No way.
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:09.920]  Yeah.
[01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:11.060]  I mean, this is a cult.
[01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:12.279]  This is the takedown of society.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:23.720]  So when I did all of the labor classes, the maternity classes, and when I was trying to find my doula, it was finding a needle in a haystack to find someone that wasn't using the word birthing person.
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:31.239]  And I would write to them and I would say, I'm a mother, I'm a woman, and if your contract that you're sending me says birthing person, I'm not working with you.
[01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:32.859]  And they're like, we're so sorry you feel that way.
[01:22:33.079 --> 01:22:34.399]  More people need to say that.
[01:22:34.539 --> 01:22:36.460]  Well, I don't wanna start a fight and I need a doula.
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.840]  There's a doula, find one.
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:39.359]  Find one that works on an army base.
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:40.520]  There are people.
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:44.300]  And the final equation is this isn't just some weird grassroots cult.
[01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:46.279]  It's funded by the biggest banks, by BlackRock.
[01:22:46.399 --> 01:22:47.720]  It is a societal takeover.
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:48.699]  It is a cult.
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:53.100]  It's not because they're liberals and mean well, and these people are following criminal orders.
[01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:54.100]  It's criminal.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.680]  I mean, this is grooming, just like a pedophile tries to groom a kid.
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.439]  But they're grooming them not just to rape them.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:02.979]  They're grooming them to sterilize them and wreck their life and medicalize them.
[01:23:03.319 --> 01:23:05.260]  Oh, because the money in that is insane.
[01:23:05.479 --> 01:23:14.079]  It's a massive industry, so I can keep you on hormones for the rest of your life and then give you another pill to cure the sexual dysfunction that you caused by these puberty blockers.
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:15.720]  And then, oh wait, you're actually super depressed.
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:16.880]  We have something for that too.
[01:23:16.979 --> 01:23:18.539]  So you're constantly on this pill mill.
[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:22.939]  The Wachowski brothers are coming out with a new movie, ones that made The Matrix.
[01:23:23.079 --> 01:23:27.680]  They're both, I think they're women now, where the trans person goes around murdering the straight men.
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:34.060]  And the new Hellraiser is a man-to-woman that kills people and chops their penises off.
[01:23:34.159 --> 01:23:35.199]  I mean, this is Hellraiser.
[01:23:35.399 --> 01:23:36.359]  That's insane.
[01:23:36.899 --> 01:23:37.920]  Absolute Hellraiser.
[01:23:38.319 --> 01:23:40.020]  Candice Horbach, you are our guest.
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:43.000]  Again, we'll put the URL on screen for TV. We order for radio listeners.

[01:23:58.210 --> 01:24:00.930]  And then we will get into all the other news.
[01:24:01.050 --> 01:24:03.270]  And I'll give you some of my angles on what's coming next.

[01:25:09.039 --> 01:25:14.579]  Dollar is so worthless that it's almost financially impossible for kids to move out of the house when they're 18.
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:18.020]  When it was possible 50 years ago, a lot of people started families when they were 18.
[01:25:18.039 --> 01:25:20.979]  My parents got married when they were 23 and started having kids right away and had their own house.
[01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:35.630]  It's just so financially difficult to accomplish that now that we have like 28 year olds, 29 year olds, 30 year olds even, that still act like college kids or seniors in high school because financially speaking it's been very difficult for them to just get to the point where they can't even afford to get out of the basement.
[01:25:35.770 --> 01:25:51.430]  Even like the idea of moving out, especially a young couple moving out and getting Your own home is relatively new because it used to be you'd have the family farm and the family plantation and like you would have your own space but you were all working together and you would have multiple generations on.
[01:25:51.649 --> 01:25:52.710]  So you want to go back to plantations?
[01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.609]  Compound?
[01:25:53.909 --> 01:25:55.930]  Absolutely, I would do a compound with enough land.
[01:25:56.170 --> 01:26:02.930]  I love that concept and there's this idea that it was actually kind of propagandized by mortgage companies because they wanted more people buying houses.
[01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:09.050]  They were like, oh, you're 18, you need to be able to, like, get busy with your lady and not have mom and dad right there.
[01:26:09.369 --> 01:26:10.289]  Buy your own house.
[01:26:10.409 --> 01:26:12.609]  And then they started to kind of split up the family that way.
[01:26:14.529 --> 01:26:17.250]  You can be a left-wing populist or you can be a right-wing populist.
[01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:20.090]  What is populism for the average person that has no idea?
[01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:24.010]  Populism is simply the belief that it's not about the left versus the right.
[01:26:24.029 --> 01:26:26.189]  It's about the people versus the political class.
[01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:27.069]  Seems reasonable.
[01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:29.949]  So you can be a left-wing populist or you can be a right-wing populist.
[01:26:30.010 --> 01:26:34.250]  It's just the belief that no one on the political class represents the interests of the people.
[01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:40.050]  And therefore, as a populist, I believe in taking power back from the political class and putting it into the hands of the people.
[01:26:40.079 --> 01:26:43.779]  Wasn't that one of the main critiques about Trump when he was first running?
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.279]  They're like, oh, he's a populist candidate.
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:49.859]  Anyone who voted for someone because they were a populist sounds like they were retarded.
[01:26:50.039 --> 01:26:50.220]  Yeah.
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:50.760]  Why?
[01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:55.699]  Political class hates populism because populism is about taking power away from the political class.
[01:26:55.899 --> 01:27:01.520]  So you even have Nancy Pelosi in a recent debate talking about how populism was anti-democratic or a threat to democracy.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:02.659]  It's like, you fucking idiot.
[01:27:02.739 --> 01:27:07.560]  It's like a form of representation for the people that's superior to your bullshit democracy life.
[01:27:07.689 --> 01:27:19.989]  Yeah, there's definitely a threat, but the thing is, the more the political class fails us, and this is true for any nation throughout history, the more the political class has failed the people, whether you go back to the Weimar Republic or what's happening now in the United States, the more populous the people become.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:29.539]  Candace Horbach is our guest in the studio for the next 30 minutes and then Dale Bigtree.
[01:27:29.699 --> 01:27:39.739]  Dale Bigtree is joining us, the head of the Maha movement, critical in the RFK-Trump merger that's got the globalists crapping their britches.
[01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:49.079]  Candace, I wanted to talk about the attacks on comedy and how they tried to claim this was a Nazi event because the Nazis 85 years before had a rally at Madison Square Garden.
[01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:58.560]  That means anybody else, the RNC, the DNC that was there, Rolling Stones, you know, Tupac, anybody that ever played there, is now a Nazi.
[01:27:59.359 --> 01:28:01.619]  To me, I don't understand how they could...
[01:28:02.279 --> 01:28:03.920]  I mean, that is not even thin.
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:05.720]  That is completely empty and a joke.
[01:28:05.859 --> 01:28:06.479]  It blew up in their face.
[01:28:06.579 --> 01:28:13.520]  But then they got Tony Hitchcliffe, a good friend of mine, done his show many times, his comedy many times, at the Vulcan Gas Company and the Mothership with Joe.
[01:28:14.119 --> 01:28:15.579]  He makes jokes about everybody.
[01:28:15.739 --> 01:28:17.640]  He makes a joke about Puerto Rico floating garbage.
[01:28:17.819 --> 01:28:19.539]  And now they say, see, it's Nazis.
[01:28:19.539 --> 01:28:20.779]  I want to play some of these clips.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.239]  Then AOC responded today and called it Filthadelphia.
[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:26.659]  So she used her own term about a blue city.
[01:28:26.899 --> 01:28:28.840]  And now, but that's okay when she does it.
[01:28:29.319 --> 01:28:29.840]  Of course.
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:31.159]  Party of double standards.
[01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:33.550]  But it's not working anymore.
[01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:35.369]  No, I don't think so.
[01:28:35.430 --> 01:28:39.649]  If you saw all the feedback on that clip of Tony, everyone was like, it's a joke.
[01:28:39.649 --> 01:28:40.529]  He's a comedian.
[01:28:40.529 --> 01:28:43.310]  You're not supposed to take anything that he is saying seriously.
[01:28:43.369 --> 01:28:44.789]  It's all meant in good fun.
[01:28:44.890 --> 01:28:46.329]  And the crowd didn't really like that one either.
[01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:50.029]  And then he pivoted and he found his group there.
[01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:51.829]  Yeah, there's supposedly Nazis.
[01:28:51.930 --> 01:28:56.050]  One joke you could say is quasi-racist against Hispanics.
[01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:57.909]  The crowd didn't like it.
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:00.180]  Right, and there was a ton of Hispanics there.
[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:01.560]  I was watching this one woman there.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:04.300]  She said there was a bunch of Jewish New Yorkers.
[01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:05.960]  There were black New Yorkers.
[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:07.600]  It was just a whole mixed race.
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:10.199]  And you're like, for a Nazi party, they're not doing so good.
[01:29:10.199 --> 01:29:11.500]  It's the wrong audience.
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:12.119]  No, they're not.
[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:17.420]  So first, before we play the supposedly racist joke, let's play the one I really liked about the Clintons.
[01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:18.079]  It's not a joke.
[01:29:18.159 --> 01:29:21.119]  They're all the P-ditty or pedo-ditty party.
[01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:23.560]  Then we'll play his, we'll just play them all back-to-back.
[01:29:23.859 --> 01:29:25.840]  Then we'll play his clip that they're saying it's racist.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:27.439]  Then we'll play AOC's response.
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:27.880]  Here they are.
[01:29:29.859 --> 01:29:33.180]  Hillary Clinton said that this is a Nazi rally here today.
[01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:40.779]  Can you believe that?
[01:29:41.699 --> 01:29:49.800]  For the most anti-war president of my entire lifetime, and she calls him Hitler.
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:56.760]  Let me remind you, Hillary, it was your husband who shot innocent people, or as he called them, interns.
[01:30:01.130 --> 01:30:04.170]  Yeah, Hillary, I bet you did not see that one coming.
[01:30:06.890 --> 01:30:10.409]  By the way, if I commit suicide in three weeks, I didn't.
[01:30:13.569 --> 01:30:16.869]  I did not.
[01:30:19.050 --> 01:30:21.770]  The other side's got a lot of crazy endorsements.
[01:30:21.970 --> 01:30:24.989]  Swift, Eminem, Leo DiCaprio, Beyonce.
[01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:30.229]  Every day the Democratic Party looks more and more like a P. Diddy party.
[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:33.780]  Oh!
[01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:34.840]  Oh, okay!
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.399]  Okay, that's what you guys want!
[01:30:39.539 --> 01:30:41.319]  All right, heck yeah!
[01:30:41.619 --> 01:30:42.420]  These are terrifying.
[01:30:42.819 --> 01:30:44.800]  It is absolutely wild times.
[01:30:45.359 --> 01:30:47.340]  It really, really is.
[01:30:47.859 --> 01:30:50.920]  And, you know, there's a lot going on.
[01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:56.779]  Like, I don't know if you guys know this, but there's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now.
[01:30:57.079 --> 01:30:57.560]  Yeah.
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:59.119]  I think it's called Puerto Rico.
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:01.659]  Okay.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:02.579]  All right.
[01:31:03.119 --> 01:31:03.560]  Okay.
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:04.760]  We're getting there.
[01:31:06.159 --> 01:31:07.619]  Who is that, Jack Watt?
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:08.260]  Who is that guy?
[01:31:08.279 --> 01:31:11.199]  Actually, I think that's Tony Hinchcliffe, which is super disappointing.
[01:31:11.699 --> 01:31:13.500]  I mean, he's a comedian.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:14.760]  Oh, I think she likes Tony.
[01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:18.319]  I don't follow this, like, career very closely.
[01:31:18.659 --> 01:31:19.659]  The girls like Tony.
[01:31:19.899 --> 01:31:23.079]  This was what, when he went down after Helene, the horrific...
[01:31:23.109 --> 01:31:39.590]  We're good to go.
[01:31:44.789 --> 01:31:46.270]  People in Puerto Rico are citizens.
[01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:49.470]  They pay taxes and they serve in the military at almost a higher rate than anybody else.
[01:31:49.930 --> 01:31:50.050]  Yeah.
[01:31:50.210 --> 01:31:51.550]  I mean, it's like super upsetting.
[01:31:51.729 --> 01:31:52.930]  Obviously, it's super upsetting.
[01:31:53.329 --> 01:31:54.890]  My family is from Puerto Rico.
[01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:55.710]  I'm Puerto Rican.
[01:31:55.890 --> 01:32:04.270]  And like, the thing that is so messed up that I wish more people understood is that...
[01:32:05.949 --> 01:32:18.609]  The things that they do in Puerto Rico are a testing ground for the policies and the horrors that they wish to and that they do unveil in working class communities across the United States.
[01:32:18.609 --> 01:32:19.350]  Oh, like the blue cities?
[01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:33.430]  And I need people to understand that when you have some a-hole calling Puerto Rico floating garbage, know that that's what they think about you.
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:36.779]  That's just what they think about you.
[01:32:36.779 --> 01:32:39.500]  It's what they think about anyone who makes less money than them.
[01:32:39.619 --> 01:32:42.619]  It's what they think about the people who serve them food in a restaurant.
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:48.239]  It's what they think about the people who fold their clothes in a store.
[01:32:48.659 --> 01:32:49.500]  No, this is what the Democrats think about us.
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:52.119]  Dude, are you serious?
[01:32:52.539 --> 01:32:53.659]  Like, are you serious?
[01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:57.659]  Yeah, the privilege of being on this campaign is traveling across the entire country.
[01:32:57.899 --> 01:33:04.359]  There are hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans across in battleground states that need to send them a message.
[01:33:04.479 --> 01:33:05.539]  So this is their best shot.
[01:33:05.859 --> 01:33:08.720]  I want them to, like, roll that.
[01:33:08.939 --> 01:33:11.220]  I want everyone in Philadelphia to see that clip.
[01:33:11.649 --> 01:33:15.890]  If you live in Philly, why don't you go and see that clip?
[01:33:16.270 --> 01:33:19.989]  If you live in Redding, Pennsylvania, which I was there.
[01:33:20.090 --> 01:33:21.189]  I was in Redding last week.
[01:33:21.329 --> 01:33:28.010]  If you're in Redding, if you're in Philly, look at that trash.
[01:33:28.829 --> 01:33:33.909]  What is trash is people actually just...
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:36.939]  Thinking of other human beings that way.
[01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:39.319]  Are you actually for real?
[01:33:39.439 --> 01:33:48.399]  And the thing that gets me is that these people rely, their entire lives rely on working class people.
[01:33:48.659 --> 01:34:03.479]  If you have someone that's not there to harvest the crops that show up in your grocery store, in your Erewhon or your Whole Foods or wherever it is that you go to eat, if you think lesser of...
[01:34:04.210 --> 01:34:06.090]  Of working class Americans.
[01:34:06.609 --> 01:34:07.649]  Caring for children.
[01:34:08.409 --> 01:34:09.210]  That's a long club.
[01:34:09.329 --> 01:34:09.949]  You heard her say Philadelphia.
[01:34:10.510 --> 01:34:16.050]  But the bigger point is there they are on their little online thing trying to counter Madison Square Garden.
[01:34:16.170 --> 01:34:16.670]  It's not working.
[01:34:16.729 --> 01:34:17.729]  They both look desperate to me.
[01:34:18.069 --> 01:34:26.029]  Yeah, I mean, his little Twitch setup that he had that he posted was so pitiful, and it just shows how much they're really trying to get the young male vote.
[01:34:26.250 --> 01:34:28.829]  I don't know if it's gonna work because no one's dating anymore.
[01:34:29.029 --> 01:34:30.310]  I think young men are fed up.
[01:34:30.449 --> 01:34:34.289]  They have to see the prices of what they're earning, what they're paying in taxes.
[01:34:34.649 --> 01:34:35.710]  They can't afford a date.
[01:34:35.770 --> 01:34:40.069]  So I don't know that we're going to see the wave of these young male feminists anymore.
[01:34:40.069 --> 01:34:41.489]  I think that they're kind of fed up.
[01:34:41.649 --> 01:34:43.810]  So I think that is a wasted effort.
[01:34:43.869 --> 01:34:45.310]  And it's just very thirsty.
[01:34:45.310 --> 01:34:46.109]  It's obvious.
[01:34:46.130 --> 01:34:48.850]  If I put these headphones on, I'm going to resonate with young men.
[01:34:48.970 --> 01:34:49.810]  It's a joke.
[01:34:49.829 --> 01:34:50.510]  It's cosplay.
[01:34:50.770 --> 01:34:58.170]  What did you make, I don't know if you saw it, of Obama and then Michelle Obama and all of them criticizing black men that are voting for Trump?
[01:34:58.399 --> 01:34:59.439]  That was insane.
[01:34:59.699 --> 01:35:05.579]  How patronizing that if you're black, you have to vote for the black ambiguous lady.
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:08.500]  And if you're not voting for her, it's because you clearly don't like women.
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:11.979]  It's like, if that's all she's running on, no one should be voting for her.
[01:35:12.119 --> 01:35:14.600]  You're actually making a wild case against her.
[01:35:14.659 --> 01:35:15.520]  What are her policies?
[01:35:15.659 --> 01:35:16.739]  What change does she want to make?
[01:35:16.939 --> 01:35:20.520]  She went on an interview and said, I would have done absolutely nothing different than Joe Biden.
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:22.079]  So we say that we want change.
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:24.579]  No one is happy where we are, but she said it herself.
[01:35:24.939 --> 01:35:26.159]  She wouldn't have done anything differently.
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:28.020]  So why are you voting for this person?
[01:35:28.350 --> 01:35:34.289]  I don't understand how we're supposed to resonate with someone just because they're the same sex as us or the same race as us.
[01:35:34.329 --> 01:35:38.310]  That says nothing about your character or what your vision for the future is.
[01:35:38.869 --> 01:35:47.909]  Candace, do you think anything that the corporate establishment running the Democratic Party is pushing, are any of their pitches resonating other than misrepresenting Roe v.
[01:35:47.989 --> 01:35:51.050]  Wade, which is just handing it back to the states, are any of their pitches working?
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:52.600]  I don't think so, no.
[01:35:52.779 --> 01:36:05.000]  And that's the one that I think is still a hangup, because when you talk to young women, women that are still in their fertile years, they think that automatically the entire state, they don't have access, or in the entire country, they don't have access to abortion at all.
[01:36:05.079 --> 01:36:09.619]  And it's exactly as you said, it's just going back to states' rights, which we should all be for, right?
[01:36:09.699 --> 01:36:11.039]  We all should want smaller government.
[01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:16.380]  It has turned into this Goliath and this machine, which is why we are where we are.
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:18.960]  So no, go back to states' rights, especially for things like that.
[01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:26.810]  Candace, looking at the left, I mean, they say Republicans want to ban books.
[01:36:26.970 --> 01:36:27.229]  No.
[01:36:27.649 --> 01:36:31.850]  What you just mentioned with your son, who's in preschool, they're trying to brainwash him.
[01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:37.350]  We don't want, not just sex books, that'd be bad enough, Playboys or whatever.
[01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:41.130]  We've showed them on air, what's in the Austin Library for middle schoolers.
[01:36:41.250 --> 01:36:46.390]  I mean, hardcore graphic sex novels of children having sex with adults.
[01:36:46.569 --> 01:36:48.430]  It's total grooming.
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:52.899]  I mean, it's not banning alcohol to say don't give it to 5-year-olds.
[01:36:53.020 --> 01:36:56.079]  It's not banning cigarettes to say don't give it to 10-year-olds.
[01:36:56.180 --> 01:36:58.300]  It's not saying you're banned from the military.
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:36:59.260]  You just have to be 18.
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:09.119]  So this idea, when it's the Democrats censoring political speech and conservatives and populists, that's not working either.
[01:37:09.579 --> 01:37:16.520]  No, it's wildly misleading because they're trying to say that they're the party that is championing free speech by doing this.
[01:37:16.619 --> 01:37:17.920]  Look at the party that's burning books.
[01:37:18.119 --> 01:37:23.659]  Well, no, there's certain levels of what is age appropriate, and these books are certainly not age appropriate.
[01:37:23.659 --> 01:37:28.300]  I don't think that any four-year-old needs to go see a book about transitioning.
[01:37:28.479 --> 01:37:32.649]  I don't think that any- Ten-year-old needs to learn how to use toys, right?
[01:37:32.770 --> 01:37:36.869]  That was in a lot of the books where they're showing if you're trans, how to use specific adult toys.
[01:37:37.090 --> 01:37:43.289]  You can't go into the adult store unless you're 18, so why are you giving a book to someone who is under 18 with the things that they're not even allowed to purchase?
[01:37:43.289 --> 01:37:44.149]  It's pedophile grooming.
[01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:45.170]  Yeah, it's insane.
[01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:51.109]  But the parents that are defending it, I wonder, why do they think that this is supposed to be sex ed?
[01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:56.630]  And then they're like, oh, they're trying to take us back to Handmaid's Tales, and we're going to actually have more teen pregnancies, and this is a big issue.
[01:37:56.670 --> 01:37:59.270]  There's only nine states that have abstinence-only policies.
[01:37:59.270 --> 01:38:01.829]  So it's just a boogeyman that doesn't exist.
[01:38:02.069 --> 01:38:05.069]  I want to play a clip of this new TV ad they're running nationwide.
[01:38:07.739 --> 01:38:08.899]  This is a clip 18.
[01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:12.899]  Ad by pro-Democrat group features a man masturbating.
[01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:14.859]  And again, he's doing it under a cover.
[01:38:14.979 --> 01:38:17.619]  I hate to play stuff like this for a show that so many people watch.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.779]  It's not that big a deal, but it's not graphic.
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:24.439]  But the point is, it's really cheesy and stupid in my view.
[01:38:24.539 --> 01:38:25.619]  I don't know if you've seen this ad yet.
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:26.560]  I've seen clips, yeah.
[01:38:26.939 --> 01:38:29.159]  And so a Republican...
[01:38:30.069 --> 01:38:34.810]  Creepy guy, kind of like Tim Walls, pops in and says, what are you doing?
[01:38:35.569 --> 01:38:45.090]  So again, now they're going after the porn viewer or I guess guys that are married to their computer angle here.
[01:38:45.250 --> 01:38:46.250]  Wankers of the world unite.
[01:38:46.989 --> 01:38:52.130]  Pro-Harris PAC goes hard after the key wanker American demographic.
[01:38:52.569 --> 01:38:53.770]  And again, I watched this ad.
[01:38:54.090 --> 01:39:00.909]  Who wants to be this guy who's sitting there and this is how they think they're going to get voters?
[01:39:01.050 --> 01:39:06.829]  I mean, to me, they're doing stuff that makes them look absolutely ridiculous.
[01:39:06.829 --> 01:39:07.569]  Here it is.
[01:39:09.529 --> 01:39:10.050]  Oh!
[01:39:12.730 --> 01:39:14.430]  Sorry, you can't do that.
[01:39:14.569 --> 01:39:15.369]  What the hell, man?
[01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:16.289]  How'd you get in here?
[01:39:16.409 --> 01:39:18.010]  I'm your Republican congressman.
[01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:21.869]  Now that we're in charge, we're banning Bourne nationwide.
[01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:23.270]  You can't tell me what to do.
[01:39:23.369 --> 01:39:24.689]  Get out of my bedroom, you creep!
[01:39:25.010 --> 01:39:27.710]  I won the last election, so it's my decision.
[01:39:28.210 --> 01:39:32.090]  I'm just gonna watch and make sure you don't finish illegally.
[01:39:33.369 --> 01:39:36.109]  But they're the ones going after our kids and trying to sexualize them.
[01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:37.229]  They're the ones doing all this.
[01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:44.829]  So they're trying to make this link to Project 2025, which Trump has said countless times has nothing to do with him.
[01:39:45.029 --> 01:39:47.489]  He doesn't support it, that they're pretty radical.
[01:39:47.989 --> 01:39:50.710]  To me, I believe him when he says that.
[01:39:50.850 --> 01:39:54.010]  I believe that he respects the Constitution and the First Amendment.
[01:39:54.250 --> 01:39:58.069]  I don't see the Republican Party trying to take away free press.
[01:39:58.850 --> 01:40:04.670]  Larry Flint has a really good quote on this, and he says, you can't be halfway pregnant, so you either have a free press or you don't.
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:08.939]  So to me, when I look at Trump, I think that he is a staunch defender of the Constitution.
[01:40:08.939 --> 01:40:11.340]  I don't see him taking that away whatsoever.
[01:40:11.819 --> 01:40:14.199]  You've obviously had your run in with this as well.
[01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:16.960]  It's like you either believe in the First Amendment and freedom or you don't.
[01:40:17.039 --> 01:40:22.260]  So I think, again, they're presenting this weird boogeyman that the bad conservatives are gonna come take away your porn.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:31.100]  Yes, there is a lot of interesting things happening in individual states when it comes to that First Amendment and certain, I guess, firewalls that are popping up.
[01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:35.829]  But that's, again, that's not something to vote on necessarily because it doesn't exist.
[01:40:36.069 --> 01:40:40.109]  This radical party project 2025 has nothing to do with Trump.
[01:40:40.289 --> 01:40:44.829]  And the thing is, they're like, well, this one person used to work on his cabinet, so then that means he's linked to it.
[01:40:44.909 --> 01:40:47.850]  I'm not responsible for what my employees do when they're not working for me.
[01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:48.739]  Exactly.
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:52.840]  It's the Heritage Foundation, one of the biggest Republican think tanks.
[01:40:52.939 --> 01:40:55.319]  They always put out their recommendations for the Republican platform.
[01:40:55.479 --> 01:40:58.500]  But as you said, a year before, Trump has his platform.
[01:40:58.699 --> 01:41:02.199]  And what his platform is with Trump, you can be sure what he says he's going to do, he's going to do.
[01:41:02.279 --> 01:41:02.920]  That's not even on the radar.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  Yeah, so I believe him.
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:06.840]  I don't think that he's coming for your free speech.
[01:41:06.939 --> 01:41:08.359]  I don't think he's coming for your porn.
[01:41:08.899 --> 01:41:10.880]  I am a freedom maximalist.
[01:41:11.060 --> 01:41:13.640]  I think that it's protected there for a reason.
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:14.460]  It needs to stay there.
[01:41:14.619 --> 01:41:17.420]  That doesn't mean that there's not issues with it whatsoever.
[01:41:17.659 --> 01:41:20.739]  But no, I don't think that that makes sense as a campaign ad.
[01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:39.630]  So, I've talked a lot about this, and I know you're up on this because you're a new sound like I am and be your show almost every day, but the Democrats have said they're going to contest the election, they're not going to certify it, they're going to create civil war conditions, they want armed uprisings, James Carville, they're already getting their new electors ready,
[01:41:39.909 --> 01:41:42.909]  and they say they're going to stretch this out forever.
[01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:48.659]  The average populist or conservative or just anti-establishment person, that's really what this is now.
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:55.720]  I mean, you know, Joe Rogan made the point with Trump Friday on the podcast on the road from here that, I mean, the Republicans really are the rebels now.
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:58.300]  Kind of the blue blood's been pushed out, the neocons have been pushed out.
[01:41:58.739 --> 01:42:01.039]  Republicans aren't perfect, but it's definitely the party of change.
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:09.470]  And I don't see Republicans getting violent if the election gets stretched out a few weeks.
[01:42:09.649 --> 01:42:11.149]  They're obviously hoping that happens.
[01:42:11.310 --> 01:42:14.029]  I'm concerned about the deep state staging things to blame on us.
[01:42:14.090 --> 01:42:14.810]  What's your take on that?
[01:42:15.010 --> 01:42:16.789]  Well, yeah, you'd have agent provocateurs, right?
[01:42:16.890 --> 01:42:19.069]  Those have existed for a very long time.
[01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:21.470]  That's why there's a word for it.
[01:42:21.569 --> 01:42:22.329]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:22.590 --> 01:42:23.710]  It's because it exists.
[01:42:24.130 --> 01:42:28.010]  I am concerned about what's gonna happen probably the fifth or the sixth.
[01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:33.510]  And it is also really concerning that we don't have results right away, that they're like, it could take weeks to get this.
[01:42:33.670 --> 01:42:34.569]  That's unacceptable.
[01:42:34.670 --> 01:42:35.430]  It's scanned.
[01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:36.050]  It's processed.
[01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:37.890]  You should absolutely know within the same day.
[01:42:38.029 --> 01:42:45.289]  But I am worried if you see all of the violence that's happened over 2020, 2021, it wasn't in red counties or red states.
[01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:50.789]  It was all these blue cities and it was It was what you would think, the typical Democratic voter.
[01:42:51.010 --> 01:42:54.109]  So I think you stay in, you stay safe.
[01:42:54.289 --> 01:42:58.989]  You have your second amendment for a reason, but I am concerned as well, especially as a mother.
[01:42:59.109 --> 01:43:03.069]  I'm like, if things get crazy, especially downtown where it's more populated, what do I do?
[01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:13.449]  And it's crazy that we're in this place where an election goes away that you don't like, or you have something like an agent provocateur, and you have to worry about real violence in a country like the United States of America.
[01:43:13.630 --> 01:43:16.909]  You have to worry about real Riots.
[01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:17.949]  It makes no sense.
[01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:25.050]  We used to have these peaceful concessions of power, or it's just like, I don't like the guy, but yeah, he won fair and square.
[01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:27.189]  I agree.
[01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:29.090]  Well, you make a lot of great points on your show.
[01:43:29.170 --> 01:43:30.149]  You make a lot of great ones here.
[01:43:30.289 --> 01:43:31.949]  In the time we've got left, five, six minutes left.
[01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:37.369]  As an American, as a woman, as a mother, what is your message to America?
[01:43:37.970 --> 01:43:44.430]  And just, if you were talking to 10 million people, which you are, conservatively, what is your message to them?
[01:43:44.649 --> 01:44:08.170]  I would say that you have to vote for the party and the person that is on the side of humanity, on the side of life, that wants to see your kids have a bright future, that doesn't want to send us into World War III, that wants them to be healthy, that wants them to stop eating poisoned food and taking poisonous medications and telling them that their body is incorrect and just support the party of life.
[01:44:09.710 --> 01:44:11.069]  I mean, that's what Elon Musk has said.
[01:44:11.130 --> 01:44:12.350]  He said, with Trump, he got a shot.
[01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:13.649]  With Kamala Harris, it's doom.
[01:44:13.829 --> 01:44:18.050]  I mean, they're literally coming in here saying we're gonna ban eating meat.
[01:44:18.210 --> 01:44:19.590]  And then Trump says they want to ban eating meat.
[01:44:19.609 --> 01:44:20.329]  They go, you're crazy.
[01:44:20.689 --> 01:44:21.909]  They can't have it that way.
[01:44:22.029 --> 01:44:29.090]  Well, they serve it on the menu at the WEF. So they're telling you that you're gonna eat bugs, but I get to have this filet mignon.
[01:44:30.329 --> 01:44:33.149]  It's hypocrites all the way down.
[01:44:33.310 --> 01:44:34.449]  It's hypocrites all the way down.
[01:44:34.609 --> 01:44:35.810]  How long have you supported Trump?
[01:44:36.579 --> 01:44:41.000]  This will technically be my third time voting for him because we had to vote for him to be on the ticket in North Carolina.
[01:44:41.399 --> 01:44:43.159]  So yeah, I did early voting the day of.
[01:44:43.939 --> 01:44:44.460]  I knew that.
[01:44:44.539 --> 01:44:45.220]  I was just letting you say it.
[01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:46.960]  So it's not like you're some fly-by-night person.
[01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:47.699]  But I want to say this.
[01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:50.539]  We should support people that are just now waking up.
[01:44:50.619 --> 01:44:51.600]  We have to be ready to win.
[01:44:52.239 --> 01:44:56.279]  And the fact that the system's starting to say, well, maybe he is the one we can't stop it.
[01:44:56.319 --> 01:44:57.460]  They go, oh God, he's sold out.
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:44:59.000]  He's not selling out to anybody.
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:00.819]  Nobody runs Trump but Trump.
[01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:03.340]  But I do agree with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:03.739]  and others.
[01:45:03.899 --> 01:45:05.420]  We're talking about this next hour with Del Bigtree.
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:10.039]  Who's instrumental in the whole Maha movement, really, other than Kennedy, the head of it.
[01:45:10.479 --> 01:45:17.920]  We have got to hold, not hold Trump's feet to the fire, but his people, because that's where the real change comes and drain the swamp.
[01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:21.220]  It's not just putting a good cabinet in, but making sure none of the globalist operatives are in there.
[01:45:21.949 --> 01:45:23.310]  No, I'm really hopeful too.
[01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:28.529]  And I think I went to this really progressive conference recently and I was definitely the most right person there.
[01:45:28.710 --> 01:45:35.890]  And I just sat down and spoke to people that had never considered voting for Trump and I swayed two people at least.
[01:45:36.689 --> 01:45:40.609]  The reason is they're getting totally different news than the rest of the world.
[01:45:40.810 --> 01:45:48.890]  So if you were looking at what was happening in North Carolina at the time, right after the hurricane hit, if you went on something like X or Fox News, they were showing the devastation.
[01:45:48.989 --> 01:45:50.430]  They were showing the people that had lost everything.
[01:45:50.430 --> 01:45:54.270]  They were showing that they had to somehow find a computer to apply for that $750.
[01:45:54.649 --> 01:45:59.710]  And just like how much of a mess the federal government and even the local government was making of everything.
[01:45:59.890 --> 01:46:05.569]  If you went on to CNN, all you saw was this is because of climate change and now the mountains aren't safe.
[01:46:05.890 --> 01:46:07.710]  So they're literally getting different news.
[01:46:07.829 --> 01:46:12.850]  So it comes down to just having these conversations with people from a place of trying to change hearts and minds.
[01:46:12.850 --> 01:46:14.829]  And hopefully we'll see a big red wave.
[01:46:15.149 --> 01:46:19.210]  Since you mentioned it as a mother, you guys sent us another clip I want to play here.
[01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:24.510]  And that's Candace on cereal and kids.
[01:46:24.649 --> 01:46:25.989]  And this is a big deal.
[01:46:26.109 --> 01:46:27.430]  I want to play clip B right now.
[01:46:27.609 --> 01:46:28.250]  Here it is.
[01:46:28.909 --> 01:46:30.369]  So my oldest is four.
[01:46:30.569 --> 01:46:32.350]  He's never had cereal in his life.
[01:46:32.430 --> 01:46:33.890]  He's never seen a box of cereal.
[01:46:34.130 --> 01:46:36.869]  My sister's kids live a very different lifestyle.
[01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:43.670]  And they came over and they brought a pantry worth of stuff that he's never seen.
[01:46:43.930 --> 01:46:48.170]  Cheetos, neon blue taquitos, like Oreo, golden Oreo.
[01:46:48.369 --> 01:46:49.170]  And he's just looking at it.
[01:46:49.229 --> 01:46:50.369]  He's like, what is all of this?
[01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:55.109]  He was a different child, like off the walls, chaotic, jumping, screaming.
[01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:57.310]  And he's a very chill dude.
[01:46:57.590 --> 01:47:03.170]  And it's sad because you see, you have parents that are exhausted, overworked, feel like they're at their wit's end.
[01:47:03.289 --> 01:47:05.329]  So like, I can't wake up early enough to make breakfast.
[01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:06.869]  I'm going to pour this thing of cereal.
[01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:08.529]  And then you think you have a problematic kid.
[01:47:08.649 --> 01:47:12.729]  So then you drug your kid instead of just waking up and maybe it's going to sound judgmental.
[01:47:12.789 --> 01:47:15.689]  Wake up 10 minutes early and crack a couple eggs in a pan.
[01:47:15.810 --> 01:47:17.170]  I mean, that's what I do every day.
[01:47:17.289 --> 01:47:22.630]  My kids every single day have eggs, maybe some oatmeal, some kind of like meat protein and fruit.
[01:47:22.789 --> 01:47:23.949]  Like that's breakfast every day.
[01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:24.949]  It's non-negotiable.
[01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:26.640]  And again, he hasn't seen a box of cereal.
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:36.239]  If I started his journey with solids, with, you know, lucky charms, of course he's gonna be like, oh, I don't want these eggs, give me the sugar marshmallows for breakfast, of course!
[01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:47.520]  So you have to kind of just take the things away and ultimately all of these things that seem like hurdles are going to be so much better for your family to where you're not medicating your small child.
[01:47:48.590 --> 01:47:48.909]  Wow.
[01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:54.109]  Candace Horbach, thank you so much for being with us today and coming down here from North Carolina.
[01:47:54.210 --> 01:47:55.250]  We wish everybody well up there.
[01:47:56.109 --> 01:47:57.689]  You're going to be back in town, I'm told, next week.
[01:47:57.829 --> 01:48:00.390]  Yes, I'm going to try to do something for the election, so we'll see.
[01:48:00.649 --> 01:48:00.989]  Oh, good.
[01:48:01.090 --> 01:48:02.369]  What's bringing you to Austin so much?
[01:48:02.729 --> 01:48:03.529]  Just lots of podcasts.
[01:48:03.630 --> 01:48:04.350]  This is where everyone is.
[01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:05.210]  This is the new Mecca.
[01:48:05.310 --> 01:48:08.170]  If you're trying to create change and amplify your voice, you want to be in Austin.
[01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:18.510]  I live in a beautiful town in North Carolina, which is great for raising small children, but it's not great for raising a business, so I try to do both, so pop in and Well, we'd love to have you back in studio and do the other shows as well.
[01:48:18.689 --> 01:48:19.270]  I'd love to, yeah.
[01:48:19.369 --> 01:48:19.670]  Thank you.
[01:48:19.930 --> 01:48:20.170]  Fantastic.
[01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:21.069]  We're going to go to break.
[01:48:22.069 --> 01:48:23.130]  Don't run off yet.
[01:48:23.170 --> 01:48:24.369]  I don't want to say bye to you.
[01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:25.850]  And again, thank you and your crew for coming.
[01:48:26.489 --> 01:48:29.529]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can't fight the globalists without your support.
[01:48:29.689 --> 01:48:31.630]  They're trying to shut us down, but our sponsors...
[01:48:31.979 --> 01:48:34.319]  We're getting it all set up as we continue to operate.
[01:48:34.460 --> 01:48:35.359]  Plus, we've got great products.
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:38.939]  Two days left and the big sweepstakes on the truck and $10,000 cash.
[01:48:39.039 --> 01:48:40.760]  That's a $146,000 value.

[01:48:55.539 --> 01:48:57.260]  That's funding the second American Revolution.
[01:48:57.439 --> 01:49:02.180]  George Soros, the globalists, have fought like the devil to take us off air, but they haven't because of your support.
[01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:04.140]  We could be shut down in 15 days.
[01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:13.020]  Regardless, I intend to keep fighting, so energize our sponsors at thealexjonesstore.com and the great supplement company, drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:16.079]  That's my dad's company, incredible supplements, drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:49:16.199 --> 01:49:18.779]  Those are the coordinates of the fight for freedom.

[01:49:28.699 --> 01:49:35.100]  drjonesnaturals.com and thealexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP. Our number Number three, Adele Bigtree straight ahead.
[01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:35.739]  Stay with us.
[01:49:35.899 --> 01:49:37.079]  You see it everywhere.
[01:49:37.380 --> 01:49:38.399]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:49:38.539 --> 01:49:39.619]  Alex Jones is vindicated.
[01:49:40.159 --> 01:49:48.479]  I personally appreciate folks that defend me because I've been through a lot of attacks from the deep state and the corporate media and their minions.
[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:55.319]  But really, it's more important to me that people realize that I've not been playing games and I've been accurate about 98% of the time.
[01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:57.100]  I've never gotten things wrong on purpose.
[01:49:57.300 --> 01:49:58.279]  I've never lied to you on purpose.
[01:49:58.420 --> 01:49:58.939]  I've made mistakes.
[01:49:59.829 --> 01:50:07.069]  The reason I like the vindication is people can now pay more attention to what I'm currently saying about what's happening in the world.
[01:50:07.189 --> 01:50:11.310]  And we're reaching tens of millions of new people every day.
[01:50:11.569 --> 01:50:12.989]  I mean, this is amazing.
[01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:15.829]  Just on X alone, but all over the place.
[01:50:16.010 --> 01:50:17.289]  And that's thanks to you spreading the word.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:21.079]  But there's one part of the equation that if it fails, the whole thing falls.
[01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:29.300]  Infowars is up for sale, could easily be shut down on November 13th, a few days after the election, which we now know is going to be contested.
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:31.960]  And the deep state wants me off really, really bad.
[01:50:32.079 --> 01:50:34.600]  But regardless of that, if our sponsors are backed...
[01:50:35.329 --> 01:50:41.710]  There's been backup systems set up, and things are ready to continue on regardless of what happens.
[01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:46.109]  But the funds are not there to make sure we can hire the whole crew, the folks I'm working with.
[01:50:46.189 --> 01:50:50.310]  The funds are not there yet to make sure we get the rest of the equipment that's needed with the folks I'm working with.
[01:50:50.569 --> 01:50:52.869]  So I need you to support my sponsors.
[01:50:52.869 --> 01:50:54.670]  Plus, it's really easy to do.
[01:50:55.500 --> 01:51:01.159]  These are amazing products with five-star reviews with my dad's company, drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:12.720]  And it's got a lot of the classic supplements I've promoted for years, but also a lot of new proprietary ones and other top products, private labeled by my dad, who will always back me as long as he gets the support.

[01:51:41.199 --> 01:51:43.479]  Oh, you think you've heard of all the energy pills out there?
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:46.640]  This isn't an energy pill, but it gives you energy.
[01:51:46.979 --> 01:51:57.199]  It is the breakdown that the cells create of folic acid, methylfolate with a bunch of other natural compounds that supercharge it into the cells like organic B-complex.
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:04.640]  This cleans out the mitochondria, gives you instant energy within 30 minutes with no letdown.
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:05.779]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:52:05.899 --> 01:52:10.920]  And a lot of people have issues with processing folic acid, particularly Northern Europeans.
[01:52:11.319 --> 01:52:12.600]  But everybody feels it.
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:17.439]  But if you've had an issue in your cells, you can have genetics tested for this if you want.
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:17.939]  A lot of people do.
[01:52:18.199 --> 01:52:22.239]  And you find out you've got broken genes for absorbing folic acid.
[01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:26.850]  Be careful and just take one pill the first time because it's crazy.
[01:52:27.149 --> 01:52:29.850]  You want to experience next level of foundational energy.
[01:52:29.949 --> 01:52:33.850]  Just like our information, it's absolutely amazing, and I know you're going to want to order it again.

[01:52:40.590 --> 01:52:42.010]  So, limited supply came back in.

[01:52:53.149 --> 01:52:54.149]  Try Rocket Rest.
[01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:59.310]  If you want a stimulant that's all natural and really works well, well, that's top brain, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:59.510 --> 01:53:00.010]  It's strong.
[01:53:00.189 --> 01:53:01.289]  People are blown away by it.
[01:53:01.609 --> 01:53:03.409]  They're like, wow, this is something else.
[01:53:03.529 --> 01:53:04.829]  Yeah, we're not playing games.
[01:53:05.130 --> 01:53:09.649]  And then, of course, there's a good, high-quality, staple, organic base, so it's not synthetic.
[01:53:10.029 --> 01:53:13.289]  Whole food, concentrate, multivitamin, good basis.
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:15.659]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[01:53:15.899 --> 01:53:16.960]  Foundation for everything you're doing?
[01:53:17.079 --> 01:53:17.859]  That's a good staple.
[01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:22.979]  If you're looking for high-quality multivitamin, it's a private label of a very top, high-rated one that's got five stars.
[01:53:23.439 --> 01:53:29.920]  And so many other great products, like the concentrated seed sprouts that are so good for your gut, so good for your body.
[01:53:30.319 --> 01:53:37.140]  Just some of the sprouts, your gut uses them, it's a long story, to create a special type of...
[01:53:37.579 --> 01:53:42.880]  I mean, no acid that only your intestines can create that helps regrow, you know, tendons, muscle.
[01:53:43.079 --> 01:53:44.899]  I mean, it's gut wall health.
[01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:47.319]  You want to get fiber green concentrates.
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:51.359]  All of these products and more are at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:59.100]  So if you want to back what we're doing, you want to keep us on the air and your great products at the same time, go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:01.739]  I mean, quite frankly, folks, we can't do this without you.
[01:54:02.239 --> 01:54:07.239]  Um, If we had some big billionaires that wouldn't control what I said, wouldn't have given me money, I would take it.
[01:54:07.319 --> 01:54:08.039]  But that's not happening.
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:13.260]  I'm backed by common folks just like you, just like Trump mainly is backed by small donations.
[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:16.000]  And so you can see it as a donation, but it's not.
[01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:18.180]  I want to form a long-term relationship with you.
[01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:20.239]  I want you to see how great these products are.
[01:54:20.279 --> 01:54:21.020]  My dad does.
[01:54:21.159 --> 01:54:22.739]  I need to sponsor into the future.
[01:54:22.779 --> 01:54:26.079]  So I want you to get high-quality products that really work so you come back.
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:27.420]  Again and again.
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:30.399]  Like a restaurant that serves really good, healthy, high-quality, delicious food.
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:31.680]  I want the line around the block.
[01:54:31.819 --> 01:54:32.880]  My dad wants the line around...
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:35.300]  My dad wants the line around the block.
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:37.979]  So you've got to try it to see how great it is.
[01:54:38.579 --> 01:54:39.380]  DRJonesNaturals.com.
[01:54:39.479 --> 01:54:42.880]  And separately, our other big sponsor is the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:48.460]  They will continue to make sure we stay on the air with T-shirts, with other high-quality supplements, with ball caps, with hoodies.
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:49.899]  There's some amazing designs.
[01:54:50.199 --> 01:54:52.479]  Some of the shirts are $20, $25, $30.
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:56.399]  But there are two shirts, the classic InfoWars red on navy blue.
[01:54:57.810 --> 01:55:08.369]  And a rebellion to tyrants shirt that are both $50 that have extra markup in them if you really want to support us being sure we have the funds we need to go in the future.
[01:55:08.609 --> 01:55:11.329]  And on my children, we are behind on funds.
[01:55:12.670 --> 01:55:17.010]  I haven't been defeated yet because you've been backing me, but we are so close right now.
[01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:26.550]  And so I'm here asking for your support and asking you humbly to take action now and get great products at thealexjonesstore.com as well as drjonesnagrills.com.
[01:55:26.670 --> 01:55:31.710]  And there's a bunch of specials at thealexjonesstore.com that are running right now.
[01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:36.069]  There's a VIP program that's $30 a month.

[01:56:05.689 --> 01:56:09.130]  A lot of fun stuff happening at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:56:09.449 --> 01:56:18.649]  But check out the VIP section, thealexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP. But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast, share the articles and videos, because that's what's having the big effect.
[01:56:18.750 --> 01:56:19.750]  And I see you doing it.
[01:56:19.869 --> 01:56:20.989]  You understand the urgency.
[01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:22.090]  So I salute you.
[01:56:22.149 --> 01:56:25.310]  So for myself and the whole crew, thanks for keeping us in the fight.
[01:56:25.569 --> 01:56:26.449]  Thanks for coming through.
[01:56:26.670 --> 01:56:29.430]  Now go to drjonesnaturals.com, thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:56:29.569 --> 01:56:31.310]  And I humbly and respectfully thank you.
[01:56:32.029 --> 01:56:34.149]  Show, I'm just asking you to keep me in the fight.
[01:56:34.609 --> 01:56:38.029]  And we got great t-shirts and incredible blow-you-away supplements and everything.
[01:56:38.170 --> 01:56:40.470]  And our great sponsor, yellowshownstore.com.
[01:56:40.770 --> 01:56:45.770]  There's a VIP section on there that I noticed was getting really a lot of traction.
[01:56:45.949 --> 01:56:54.149]  And I, cause I hadn't really, you know, cause other folks on this, other folks that are great run this, the folks at Bigly, great Patriot backers, total Patriots, J-sexers, you name it.
[01:56:55.239 --> 01:56:57.399]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[01:56:57.619 --> 01:57:01.359]  So when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:12.159]  So if you're a member of the Alex Jones VIP Club at alexjonesstore.com forward slash VIP, or there's just a big link at the top of the page, this is a critical time in our nation.
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:14.920]  We don't know what the future holds for the operation.
[01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:19.420]  The following information I'm about to relay to you is imperative so we can stay in touch.
[01:57:19.579 --> 01:57:22.640]  You can get great products and keep me on the air one way or the other along with the crew.
[01:57:22.979 --> 01:57:24.239]  Monthly member credits.
[01:57:24.619 --> 01:57:29.880]  Every month as a VIP member you get $40 of free store credit.
[01:57:30.159 --> 01:57:31.300]  Did you hear what I just said?
[01:57:31.399 --> 01:57:31.760]  That's right.
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:35.439]  It's like money in your pocket with the best products on the planet.
[01:57:35.819 --> 01:57:39.760]  So you pay $30 to be a VIP, and then you get $40 free.
[01:57:39.899 --> 01:57:40.859]  That's $10 you make.
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:51.699]  All the Alex Jones products at the best prices, we're talking about 10 to even 40% off the already existing sales, so sometimes it becomes lost leaders, in the store 24-7, 365 days a year.
[01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:55.640]  This is an unbeatable pricing you'll never find anywhere else.
[01:57:56.159 --> 01:58:04.420]  Automatic double entries in any of the giveaways, like the awesome turbo diesel super truck, $138,000 value, plus $1,000 cash.
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:07.779]  The winner of the sweepstakes will be announced the 30th this month.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:08.800]  You want to win?
[01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:09.920]  I know you do.
[01:58:10.119 --> 01:58:12.680]  Because the VIP will get double entries in every single giveaway.
[01:58:12.939 --> 01:58:15.319]  No effort, just double your chances, just like that.
[01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:17.560]  Exclusive VIP-only giveaways.
[01:58:17.779 --> 01:58:19.460]  This is where it gets big, folks.
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:23.079]  VIP members get entered into their own exclusive giveaways every month.
[01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:24.819]  Nobody else is allowed in these.
[01:58:25.010 --> 01:58:27.609]  Early access to products, promos, and giveaways.
[01:58:27.930 --> 01:58:32.869]  VIP members get first access to new products, promotions, and giveaways before anyone else.
[01:58:33.069 --> 01:58:34.109]  You're in the know.
[01:58:34.510 --> 01:58:36.350]  Oh, and did I mention orders over $99?
[01:58:37.010 --> 01:58:37.569]  Free shipping.
[01:58:37.569 --> 01:58:40.710]  We're not letting shipping costs slow you down.
[01:58:40.890 --> 01:58:42.130]  It just goes on from there.
[01:58:42.689 --> 01:58:49.250]  So, thealexhownstore.com forward slash VIP. Or just at the top of thealexhownstore.com, you see the VIP button.
[01:58:49.649 --> 01:58:51.590]  We're fighting the new world order.
[01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:53.470]  I don't have billionaire backers.
[01:58:53.649 --> 01:58:58.189]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[01:58:58.369 --> 01:58:59.609]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[01:59:00.409 --> 01:59:01.329]  Yellowshowstore.com.
[01:59:01.930 --> 01:59:04.649]  It's up to you whether you want to back.
[01:59:05.239 --> 01:59:07.619]  The number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[01:59:07.859 --> 01:59:16.939]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:24.180]  And I just don't know why I'm this lovable, friendly person, but Satanism pedophiles do not like me.
[01:59:24.319 --> 01:59:26.340]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:29.300]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[01:59:29.739 --> 01:59:30.539]  We've already...
[01:59:31.380 --> 01:59:32.479]  Just devastated them.
[01:59:32.619 --> 01:59:35.640]  I mean, world government, the dual orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[01:59:35.859 --> 01:59:37.220]  The whole world's turning against them.
[01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:38.800]  They're super dangerous.
[01:59:38.939 --> 01:59:41.500]  They're throwing the kitchen sink at us to try to keep control.
[01:59:41.939 --> 01:59:49.020]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've ever understood, that I should let these...
[01:59:49.690 --> 01:59:52.189]  Criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[01:59:52.510 --> 01:59:53.970]  So, again, I don't give up.
[01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:56.850]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[01:59:57.149 --> 02:00:00.489]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[02:00:00.649 --> 02:00:02.949]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[02:00:03.069 --> 02:00:04.430]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[02:00:04.609 --> 02:00:21.489]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over the social credit score and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery and you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum And are we gonna sell out our species like this?
[02:00:22.789 --> 02:00:23.970]  I mean, it's just...
[02:00:23.970 --> 02:00:25.250]  This is a joke.
[02:00:25.670 --> 02:00:26.789]  This is ridiculous.
[02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:28.369]  We're changing the world.
[02:00:28.510 --> 02:00:31.369]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:43.779]  If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you.
[02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:49.760]  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too.
[02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:56.760]  If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about, don't deal in lies.
[02:00:57.159 --> 02:01:03.520]  Or being hated, don't give way to hating, and yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise.
[02:01:05.069 --> 02:01:24.329]  If you can dream and not make dreams your master, if you can think and not make thoughts your aim, if you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two impostors just the same, if you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
[02:01:24.590 --> 02:01:41.229]  or watch the things you gave your life to broken and stoop and build them up with worn-out tools, If you can make one heap of all your winnings, and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss, and lose and start again at your beginnings,
[02:01:41.529 --> 02:01:43.869]  and never breathe a word about your loss.
[02:01:44.289 --> 02:01:56.850]  If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after they are gone, and so hold on when there is nothing in you except the will which says to them, hold on.
[02:01:57.789 --> 02:02:17.189]  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings, nor lose the common touch, if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, if all men count with you, but to none too much, if you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run,
[02:02:17.949 --> 02:02:21.310]  yours is the earth and everything that's in it.
[02:02:22.069 --> 02:02:26.609]  And, which is more, you'll be a man, my son.
[02:02:31.729 --> 02:02:34.350]  We are announcing Ultimate Hydro Force.
[02:02:34.770 --> 02:02:38.069]  Now, this is not just electrolytes, okay?
[02:02:38.449 --> 02:02:46.310]  This is really a superfood, similar to Vitamin Mineral Fusion, but with a whole bunch more electrolytes and other things in there.
[02:02:46.409 --> 02:02:51.789]  It would take me a long time to go through the ingredients, three pages of them here, and what they do.
[02:02:52.010 --> 02:03:07.739]  But it's got super high-quality Vitamin C, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, It's got panthenogenic acid, vitamin B5, so key, calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, chloride, sodium,
[02:03:08.319 --> 02:03:09.180]  and more.
[02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:11.079]  Potassium, the list goes on and on.
[02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:17.000]  And it's all the highest quality sources of it on top of that.
[02:03:17.159 --> 02:03:22.500]  And then it funds my broadcast, And the crew and all of us continuing on.
[02:03:22.659 --> 02:03:25.960]  So we need your support if Infowars shuts down November 13th to continue on.
[02:03:26.279 --> 02:03:30.220]  Regardless, it's going to help us up our game if Infowars survives.
[02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:38.920]  So please, go check out this amazing supplement, the highest quality you're going to find, with big discounts and other great supplements at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:51.369]  We sought out The very best, highest quality, rehydrating product for pre-workout, post-workout, you name it.
[02:03:51.569 --> 02:03:55.649]  And we found a top company with top reviews with Let Us Private Label it.
[02:03:55.829 --> 02:03:58.310]  And it's beyond just hydration.
[02:03:58.609 --> 02:04:01.109]  It's beyond just getting your electrolytes.
[02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:02.750]  It's a super food.
[02:04:02.869 --> 02:04:03.649]  It's a pre-workout.
[02:04:03.710 --> 02:04:04.630]  It's a post-workout.
[02:04:04.770 --> 02:04:08.409]  You've got to go read all the ingredients that are in this bad boy.
[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:18.399]  And then look at the insane low prices between 30 and 50% off depending on how many canisters you get of Ultimate Hydro Force.
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:25.220]  Now again, go look at the ingredients for yourself and the quality of the ingredients and the amount of the ingredients.
[02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:27.560]  This baby is next level.
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:33.539]  This is beyond anything out there at anywhere near this low price.
[02:04:34.119 --> 02:04:44.619]  As you know, I always seek to bring you the very best supplements possible so you get a great response, great effects, and you want to come back and get them again.
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:47.100]  Like a restaurant wants to have tasty, good, delicious food.
[02:04:47.239 --> 02:04:48.539]  So there's a line out the door.
[02:04:48.899 --> 02:04:57.020]  Well, I've got to admit some false advertising, and next time we reproduce this, or my sponsors do, we're going to probably have to change the name.
[02:04:57.380 --> 02:04:58.619]  And why is that?
[02:04:58.739 --> 02:04:59.319]  Well, it's simple.

[02:05:03.869 --> 02:05:07.510]  But it's really a superfood, post-workout, pre-workout.

[02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:25.989]  Dale Bigtry coming up.
[02:05:32.220 --> 02:05:36.279]  If you are a young adult or the parent of one, please listen carefully.
[02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:41.239]  The United States is closer now to World War III than ever before.
[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:45.659]  Russia, China and Iran have announced the three nations are seeking to strengthen ties.
[02:05:45.880 --> 02:05:49.199]  The alliance that's been formed should kill us all to the bone.
[02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:58.479]  In preparation for war, 100% of Democrats in the House Armed Services Committee support the military drafting of women aged 18 to 25.
[02:05:58.819 --> 02:06:02.819]  Congress advancing a plan to draft women into the military.
[02:06:03.020 --> 02:06:07.779]  The proposals would automatically register men for the draft on their 18th birthday.
[02:06:08.039 --> 02:06:09.899]  It would also require women to enter.
[02:06:10.119 --> 02:06:13.539]  Even so, Republican pushback is holding the bill back.
[02:06:13.819 --> 02:06:16.420]  What else do we know about this population, 18 through 24?
[02:06:16.939 --> 02:06:18.279]  They are stupid.
[02:06:19.239 --> 02:06:22.460]  That is why we put them in dormitories.
[02:06:22.859 --> 02:06:25.359]  They make really bad decisions.
[02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:32.840]  For the love of our sons and daughters, whatever you do, do not vote blue.
[02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:40.539]  Paid for by Maha Alliance and not authorized by any candidate or candidates committee.
[02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:45.500]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[02:06:46.140 --> 02:06:55.739]  It is the third hour of the Alex Jones Show and riding shotgun with us well into the fourth hour is Del Bigtree, an amazing former top TV producer.
[02:06:56.800 --> 02:07:09.020]  And, of course, he is the CEO of the Maha Alliance, former communications director for Robert Kennedy Jr., MahaAlliance.com, make America healthy again, Alliance at Maha Alliance.
[02:07:09.140 --> 02:07:18.779]  You've seen, hands down, the most powerful, truthful ads in the last few months, four of them dropping just over the weekend from the Maha Alliance with also the great support of Maha.
[02:07:19.239 --> 02:07:19.920]  Elon Musk.
[02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:22.520]  This is such an exciting time to be alive.
[02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:23.880]  He's got a lot to cover.
[02:07:24.279 --> 02:07:27.939]  And we've also got to spend some time on the updates on the poison shots and all that.
[02:07:28.119 --> 02:07:28.880]  We're totally indicated.
[02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:30.819]  And the UN treaty is in trouble.
[02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:32.600]  And Bill Gates has been indicted.
[02:07:32.819 --> 02:07:35.659]  And RFK is just already huge.
[02:07:35.939 --> 02:07:37.060]  Exploded to all-time highs.
[02:07:37.119 --> 02:07:38.279]  Definitely the game-changer.
[02:07:38.479 --> 02:07:41.359]  Because Trump was going to win, but there was so much fraud, he wouldn't make it over the top.
[02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:42.159]  Everybody agrees.
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:43.840]  It's going to be RFK Jr.
[02:07:43.899 --> 02:07:45.560]  is going to deliver this victory.
[02:07:45.699 --> 02:07:47.779]  But the deep state got a lot of tricks up their sleeves.
[02:07:47.939 --> 02:07:49.079]  So, Dale Bigtree, thanks for being here.
[02:07:49.229 --> 02:07:51.250]  You know, Alex, it's really a pleasure.
[02:07:51.390 --> 02:07:52.449]  We've both been so busy.
[02:07:52.569 --> 02:07:54.750]  I've been watching you all through this election season.
[02:07:54.750 --> 02:07:56.430]  You know, I was with Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:07:56.630 --> 02:08:01.710]  the last 18 months, running the most successful independent campaign since Ross Perot.
[02:08:01.930 --> 02:08:03.689]  I saw some of your beefs with Bobby.
[02:08:03.890 --> 02:08:05.489]  I saw you supporting some of the things.
[02:08:06.149 --> 02:08:07.229]  It's all coming together.
[02:08:07.409 --> 02:08:08.270]  You know, it's really great.
[02:08:08.510 --> 02:08:09.069]  Well, that was politics.
[02:08:09.310 --> 02:08:09.829]  Yeah, it is.
[02:08:09.909 --> 02:08:14.949]  I mean, I don't take orders from the Trump people, but they were asking me to do it.
[02:08:15.569 --> 02:08:16.750]  I think they were getting a little nervous.
[02:08:17.250 --> 02:08:17.670]  They were.
[02:08:17.970 --> 02:08:19.010]  We didn't lose Alex.
[02:08:20.689 --> 02:08:22.250]  Trump starts asking.
[02:08:23.149 --> 02:08:24.789]  I mean, I love Kennedy.
[02:08:24.890 --> 02:08:25.729]  We all know he's the real deal.
[02:08:25.970 --> 02:08:26.710]  Yeah, he's the real deal.
[02:08:26.890 --> 02:08:28.470]  I mean, I can say that...
[02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:29.250]  We're just nudging.
[02:08:29.670 --> 02:08:30.529]  Yeah, well, look.
[02:08:31.409 --> 02:08:32.270]  Like Darth Vader joints.
[02:08:32.430 --> 02:08:34.090]  It's what media is supposed to be, right?
[02:08:34.170 --> 02:08:38.149]  You're supposed to press into the things you have questions about and say, how are you going to be on guns?
[02:08:38.250 --> 02:08:39.229]  How are you going to be on these issues?
[02:08:39.449 --> 02:08:44.310]  Because we're all trying to make the most important decision, I think, in our lifetimes right now in this election.
[02:08:44.670 --> 02:08:46.770]  There's never been a more important time.
[02:08:47.149 --> 02:08:47.890]  Everyone's saying it.
[02:08:48.010 --> 02:08:49.909]  And so, you know, I'm always about it.
[02:08:49.970 --> 02:08:51.329]  I'm glad you were questioning him.
[02:08:51.409 --> 02:08:52.989]  It was making us have those conversations.
[02:08:52.989 --> 02:08:53.909]  They were real questions.
[02:08:54.130 --> 02:08:54.970]  They were real questions.
[02:08:55.010 --> 02:08:56.449]  I just had the top of the Trump campaign.
[02:08:56.569 --> 02:08:57.210]  Why are you...
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:08:59.000]  Why are you being too nice?
[02:08:59.399 --> 02:09:02.100]  I was like, the 10th phone call said, fine, I'll ask the question.
[02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:05.739]  Yeah, so I just want to say about Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:09:05.899 --> 02:09:07.720]  They say you should never meet your hero.
[02:09:07.899 --> 02:09:12.779]  I actually got to work 18 months side by side with that guy, Alex, and he's the real deal.
[02:09:13.079 --> 02:09:14.300]  I mean, he really is the real deal.
[02:09:14.399 --> 02:09:16.000]  That guy is as genuine as it gets.
[02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:24.079]  Everyone saw these deep, profound answers and all the long-form podcasts he's been doing since all of mainstream media wouldn't let him on at all.
[02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:28.619]  I mean, it was really just a total blackout by He's a mile wide and a trillion feet deep.
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:28.920]  Yeah.
[02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:31.119]  And so, I mean, he got to show the world that.
[02:09:31.279 --> 02:09:36.600]  And so it was really a blast working with him and to get the world to see who he really is.
[02:09:36.699 --> 02:09:43.880]  I mean, after spending over a decade just being labeled anti-vaxxer, anti-vaxxer, you know, for people to see, this is a guy that writes history books.
[02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:47.720]  He has a knowledge of what makes the world tick and had really good thoughts.
[02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:50.840]  And now to think he's coming together with Trump, who's just this powerhouse.
[02:09:51.420 --> 02:09:58.579]  But I think we're going to see a really different Trump presidency now with what I call the dream team.
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:06.939]  We're calling it Freedom Force with Tulsi Gabbard, Bobby Kennedy, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, J.D. Vance.
[02:10:07.739 --> 02:10:15.119]  One of the things, Alex, I think is huge is that they say about Trump, you know, all my liberal family members and friends, oh, he's a dictator.
[02:10:15.439 --> 02:10:18.220]  I mean, first of all, why wasn't a dictator the four years ago?
[02:10:18.340 --> 02:10:19.279]  Why did we have an election?
[02:10:19.420 --> 02:10:24.239]  Why did he walk out of the White House if he really didn't believe in stepping down?
[02:10:24.479 --> 02:10:39.840]  So, you know, ultimately, all of this stuff The accusations are being made, but what kind of dictator surrounds themselves with dynamic, powerful individuals themselves with huge ideas on what they want to do in the world?
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:44.220]  I keep saying it's like Abraham Lincoln had his team of rivals.
[02:10:44.359 --> 02:10:47.000]  We had the Civil War going on.
[02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:48.279]  He thought, how are we going to get through this?
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:54.039]  We've got to bring people together from all sides to show that we're able to communicate, that we can work our way through this.
[02:10:54.220 --> 02:10:58.079]  I think that's what Donald Trump is doing in a way that we've never seen before.
[02:10:58.180 --> 02:11:08.159]  We've got Tulsi Gabbard, former Democrat, Bobby Kennedy, former Democrat, Elon Musk, you know, former, I think he's a Democrat, but, you know, who knows with Elon, maybe he's just from another planet.
[02:11:08.479 --> 02:11:12.899]  But all of these people coming together, and as it's been, you know, Don Jr.
[02:11:12.979 --> 02:11:23.119]  has been saying so brilliantly and, you You know, saying, you know, ultimately we traded, you know, Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney for Tulsi Gabbard and Bobby Kennedy.
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:26.880]  We're not, we're not, no, no, no returns on those trades.
[02:11:27.119 --> 02:11:31.600]  How tone deaf are they trotting out the Cheneys who are universally unpopular?
[02:11:32.180 --> 02:11:38.000]  I grew up, I mean, literally Dick Cheney was called Darth Vader in the house, in my liberal household growing up.
[02:11:38.119 --> 02:11:51.699]  And even my own father, like I, you know, said to me, because he's pretty well got Trump derangement syndrome right now, and we were, you know, having the argument everyone's having across this country, he said, even Dick Cheney's leaving Donald Trump to go to Kamala Harris.
[02:11:51.819 --> 02:11:54.399]  I'm like, Dad, it's my effing point.
[02:11:55.250 --> 02:11:56.850]  You know, this party has changed.
[02:11:56.989 --> 02:11:58.130]  It's a party of war.
[02:11:58.609 --> 02:11:59.729]  Trump had no war.
[02:11:59.869 --> 02:12:01.130]  He was backing us out of war.
[02:12:01.229 --> 02:12:04.449]  And now all of a sudden, we're on the verge of World War III in Ukraine.
[02:12:04.649 --> 02:12:06.369]  There's no negotiations going on.
[02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:07.770]  No one's talking to Putin.
[02:12:07.970 --> 02:12:11.670]  You've got Israel in the Middle East, you know, crumbling down around us.
[02:12:11.930 --> 02:12:13.470]  China and tensions growing there.
[02:12:13.630 --> 02:12:15.670]  I mean, this is the least talented.
[02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:18.310]  North Korean troops are now in Ukraine, by the way.
[02:12:18.439 --> 02:12:19.520]  Just come on now.
[02:12:19.619 --> 02:12:20.819]  We need a negotiator.
[02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:23.020]  It's been great having the opportunity.
[02:12:23.159 --> 02:12:26.899]  I've gotten to speak on the stage at two of the Trump rallies just last week.
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.659]  I was down in Georgia, then in Las Vegas.
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:35.489]  And to really hear Trump lay out discussions I mean, he's so much fun to watch.
[02:12:35.550 --> 02:12:45.149]  If you haven't seen him live, you've got to check out President Trump Live because, I mean, he's just storytelling about these moments where negotiations are happening.
[02:12:45.390 --> 02:12:50.909]  And you know when he's talking about it, he's like describing weird little eccentricities of people.
[02:12:51.050 --> 02:12:52.470]  Like, you know he's giving you the stories.
[02:12:52.670 --> 02:12:53.649]  You know he was there.
[02:12:53.729 --> 02:13:01.329]  You know, whether it's exaggerated at times, but the truth is when it comes down to it, this is a man that was negotiating for peace all along and still is.
[02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:03.010]  They hate Trump because he's real.
[02:13:03.189 --> 02:13:03.649]  He's real.
[02:13:03.829 --> 02:13:20.569]  And when someone says, well, there's generals coming out against him, the same way the generals came out against JFK and would have come out against Robert Kennedy had they not killed him before he got in there because they were saying, look, we do not want to be in pointless wars that are just spreading the war machine and selling bombs and missiles.
[02:13:20.949 --> 02:13:22.890]  We want to be a nation of peace.
[02:13:23.029 --> 02:13:24.609]  That's what JFK, what Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:13:24.710 --> 02:13:29.909]  has been saying all along, that one of the things that JFK said when asked, what do you want written on your tombstone?
[02:13:30.090 --> 02:13:31.869]  And he said he kept the peace.
[02:13:32.449 --> 02:13:37.149]  The president's job is to keep the peace around the world, not to incite wars for no reason.
[02:13:37.390 --> 02:13:40.430]  And you also know a man like RFK Jr.
[02:13:40.689 --> 02:13:41.869]  or Trump by their enemies.
[02:13:42.109 --> 02:13:43.569]  Just last week it came out.
[02:13:44.050 --> 02:13:46.130]  MI6 connected company and group.
[02:13:47.189 --> 02:13:50.510]  Literally saying we're doing black ops against RFK Jr.
[02:13:50.529 --> 02:13:52.470]  We want to destroy him.
[02:13:53.050 --> 02:13:54.390]  More documents have come out.
[02:13:54.529 --> 02:13:54.890]  Same thing.
[02:13:54.989 --> 02:13:55.590]  The British government...
[02:13:56.039 --> 02:13:59.659]  With the Harris, whoever's running that coup, saying we gotta get Elon Musk.
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:02.500]  I mean, people that are fighting back like Trump and others, they're trying to kill.
[02:14:02.819 --> 02:14:04.439]  The globalists are really making their move.
[02:14:04.859 --> 02:14:10.460]  I think we are looking at really the last election if the globalists take over.
[02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:14.699]  I've been saying it on my show, The High Wire, you know, and going into territories.
[02:14:14.699 --> 02:14:21.699]  I started just talking about vaccines and drugs and pharmaceutical products, which is where I came into this, having left the doctor's television show.
[02:14:22.050 --> 02:14:39.729]  But now you just can't help but look at this globalist agenda, the WEF, the World Health Organization, the UN, all of these things working to the same agenda to destroy the sovereignty of the United States of America, to tear down our walls, which they've achieved over the last four years, letting migrants just pour in the way they've destroyed Europe.
[02:14:39.930 --> 02:14:41.149]  I was just in Switzerland.
[02:14:42.579 --> 02:14:45.859]  Protesting the WHO treaty, which, you know, we held back on some level.
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:46.859]  It got some things through.
[02:14:47.039 --> 02:14:51.699]  But when you're there, all the Europeans are coming up to me and saying, Del, you guys are just behind us.
[02:14:51.779 --> 02:14:54.119]  This happened to us over the last five and ten years.
[02:14:54.300 --> 02:15:01.399]  They're letting all these migrants push into our cities, into our countries, and it's just tearing our country apart.
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:02.539]  Not that we're against diversity.
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:06.000]  Villages of a hundred Germans or French, they'll put like 500 illegals.
[02:15:06.020 --> 02:15:08.020]  Yeah, just like we've done.
[02:15:08.180 --> 02:15:12.539]  You've got Haitians moving in that are now outnumbering the population that was there.
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:17.399]  We believe in immigration in this country, but legal immigration.
[02:15:17.579 --> 02:15:21.420]  But it's all a part of a plan, and they prophesied and talked about these things.
[02:15:21.439 --> 02:15:26.000]  You look at the WF. They put out that video you and I have shown a million times.
[02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:28.319]  Everyone in America is going to be renting.
[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:29.800]  No one will own anything.
[02:15:30.199 --> 02:15:33.399]  America will not be a leading voice in the world.
[02:15:33.930 --> 02:15:47.329]  That's their goal, and yet we have presidents like Barack Obama, Joe Biden, you know, going to these meetings in Davos and coming back with a big smile on their face like we got an agenda now to destroy the borders of the United States of America.
[02:15:47.670 --> 02:15:53.789]  It's critical, and to see, as you're pointing out, the known attacks on Robert Kennedy Jr., We knew that was happening.
[02:15:53.789 --> 02:15:55.310]  You know you're being censored.
[02:15:55.390 --> 02:15:56.569]  You know you're being shut down.
[02:15:56.710 --> 02:15:58.369]  I was being shut down on the high wires.
[02:15:58.430 --> 02:15:59.689]  Why Bobby and I came together?
[02:15:59.789 --> 02:16:05.090]  You know, he said to me, I want you to run my media, Del, because we know we're going to get censored.
[02:16:05.210 --> 02:16:14.909]  And somehow, when you put out Vax and you did everything you did, you've managed to keep your audience going, even though your YouTube got shut down, even though your Facebook got shut down.
[02:16:14.909 --> 02:16:15.770]  You've got the proven...
[02:16:16.300 --> 02:16:17.560]  Infrastructure to get around the center of the show.
[02:16:17.739 --> 02:16:17.739]  That's it.
[02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:18.979]  And you're similar.
[02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:21.619]  We're not afraid of the controversial headline.
[02:16:21.939 --> 02:16:23.180]  I lean into it.
[02:16:23.220 --> 02:16:25.500]  We use it as a badge of honor, and we spread it around.
[02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:32.559]  So we were able to take his campaign, which wasn't getting any mainstream views.
[02:16:32.559 --> 02:16:33.860]  He wasn't getting any interviews.
[02:16:34.079 --> 02:16:43.680]  But through social media and podcasts, he was polling 20% to 25% coming into this year, which was amazing, until they denied him access to the debate, which, you know...
[02:16:43.930 --> 02:16:46.110]  That's how you want to just shut down any possibility.
[02:16:46.510 --> 02:16:47.129]  Here's the deal.
[02:16:47.590 --> 02:16:50.829]  No independent, Trump's been saying this all along, no independent can win.
[02:16:50.909 --> 02:16:53.069]  You can't be allowed under the debate stage.
[02:16:53.149 --> 02:17:01.110]  And so that was really- And what was done to Sanders and then RFK Jr., now that, you know, I mean, that ill is, and then Biden being removed and Kamala being installed.
[02:17:01.329 --> 02:17:02.209]  I mean, this is tyranny.
[02:17:02.430 --> 02:17:04.549]  It's certainly not democracy.
[02:17:04.989 --> 02:17:06.569]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:17:06.809 --> 02:17:08.370]  When you think of, just think for a moment.
[02:17:08.610 --> 02:17:14.149]  Just think, I mean, to me, you know, it's sort of the way people are responding to Kennedy.
[02:17:14.270 --> 02:17:18.530]  When you look at the DNC, you have a Kennedy and Robert Kennedy Jr., right?
[02:17:18.729 --> 02:17:24.329]  The namesake of Robert Kennedy Sr., one of the great heroes of the Democratic Party.
[02:17:24.489 --> 02:17:26.889]  His son decides to run as a Democrat.
[02:17:27.049 --> 02:17:31.989]  He's arguably the greatest environmental attorney of all times.
[02:17:32.290 --> 02:17:34.209]  A real environmentalist.
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:03.159]  Let's just say it.
[02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:04.239]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:18:04.420 --> 02:18:11.440]  would have had a real shot of beating Trump if the Democrats would have got out of the way, but because he was a man of principle and a good person and not a globalist, they wouldn't let him happen.
[02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:12.739]  Exactly, because what do you run on?
[02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:14.620]  I'm going to end corruption in our government.
[02:18:14.620 --> 02:18:18.440]  I am going to kick out the money changers in our regulatory agencies.
[02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:24.239]  I'm going to break up the CIA so they're not both clandestine and starting wars at the same time.
[02:18:24.420 --> 02:18:26.879]  I mean, he had plans to really just clean out that government.
[02:18:26.899 --> 02:18:30.360]  Stop big pharma, stop big poison food, fix healthcare, everything.
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:31.479]  But now...
[02:18:31.639 --> 02:18:33.200]  That brings us to the next big enchilada.
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:40.120]  I mean, Kennedy's in there, he's advising, but still, we're going to have issues with the swamp trying to get their people in place.
[02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:48.479]  When Trump gets elected, and I won't get your take if you think he's about to, I think he is, the real fight is going to be immediately who Trump puts in, not just the cabinet, but 10-20 deep.
[02:18:48.959 --> 02:18:49.819]  That's the real fight.
[02:18:50.170 --> 02:18:52.629]  That's the real fight, and it's a very complicated fight, right?
[02:18:52.690 --> 02:18:59.309]  It's a huge web that has been, you know, sewn together really since, I think, the assassination of his father, Robert Kennedy.
[02:18:59.530 --> 02:19:02.430]  From that moment on, the globalists did take over this country.
[02:19:02.569 --> 02:19:07.690]  And for those that don't know, the bureaucracy, if you try to get rid of them, they just shut the government down.
[02:19:07.940 --> 02:19:08.860]  Not through Congress.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:10.100]  They just shut it down.
[02:19:10.219 --> 02:19:10.479]  That's what.
[02:19:10.579 --> 02:19:12.360]  They threaten, hey, you mess with us.
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:15.180]  We'll make you look worse than you've ever looked in your life.
[02:19:15.379 --> 02:19:18.219]  So that's why I think one of the- It's like the CIA botched bad pigs.
[02:19:19.059 --> 02:19:19.420]  Exactly.
[02:19:19.719 --> 02:19:27.420]  That's why I think one of the most important things that they're talking about, that Bobby's talking about, that President Trump is talking about, is ending direct-to-consumer marketing.
[02:19:27.549 --> 02:19:29.049]  I think they've got to do that on day one.
[02:19:29.170 --> 02:19:33.690]  You've got to go in and remove the pharmaceutical industry's power over our television set.
[02:19:33.770 --> 02:19:42.350]  For people that don't know what that means, 50 to 70 percent of all advertising on every network that you are watching your news on is coming from the pharmaceutical industry.
[02:19:42.649 --> 02:19:54.770]  Why do you think you never get a decent conversation about the dangers of the COVID vaccine or the fact that it's not stopping transmission, as Alex and I said, from day zero with that product?
[02:19:54.770 --> 02:19:57.930]  You're not getting it because they're not allowed to tell those stories.
[02:19:58.090 --> 02:20:06.409]  And I'm going to tell you, Alex, you and I both know there are great journalists inside of every one of these agencies, just like I was there before, but they're not allowed to speak.
[02:20:06.549 --> 02:20:10.809]  They're not allowed to do these stories because of that control by the pharmaceutical industry.
[02:20:11.370 --> 02:20:18.649]  If you're watching your news anchor and you think 70% of the check that's being written to them is the pharmaceutical industry, guess who their boss is?
[02:20:18.790 --> 02:20:19.370]  It's pharma.
[02:20:19.549 --> 02:20:24.069]  Well, here's gonna be the problem, Alex, is when we go in and you imagine Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:20:24.530 --> 02:20:29.950]  bringing in all of the scientists, kicking out all the special interest shills that have been working for pharma.
[02:20:30.209 --> 02:20:40.170]  In every one of our regulatory agencies, kicking out the shills from big ag, big food that have been destroying our food supply and poisoning us more than any other nation in the world.
[02:20:40.329 --> 02:20:41.870]  When you do that, what are they going to do?
[02:20:41.989 --> 02:20:45.250]  Pharma's going to say to their news anchors, tell them it's a Russian invasion.
[02:20:45.450 --> 02:20:47.989]  Tell them the United States government is under attack.
[02:20:48.549 --> 02:20:57.409]  Well, we're going to have to remove that bullhorn from the pharmaceutical industry and these special interests, I think, if you want to at least have the news do its job.
[02:20:57.569 --> 02:21:04.850]  You take away that false funding, and all of a sudden, now the news agencies have got to appeal to the consumer again.
[02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:06.209]  They're at an all-time low.
[02:21:06.350 --> 02:21:07.569]  People are barely watching it.
[02:21:07.690 --> 02:21:09.129]  You're killing them on your show.
[02:21:09.209 --> 02:21:10.530]  I'm killing them on my show.
[02:21:10.850 --> 02:21:12.329]  Joe Rogan, I mean, all these people.
[02:21:12.450 --> 02:21:21.549]  And then the news, just all they want to do is get Kamala in, So they can control the internet, so that they can get back to being in power, whether, you know, citizens want to watch them or not.
[02:21:21.649 --> 02:21:34.950]  But we've got to stop that lie machine coming through mainstream media, or it's going to get really, really hard to get anything done, because you're just going to have them ramping our country into, you know, an absolute...
[02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:36.430]  You're a really dialed-in guy.
[02:21:36.930 --> 02:21:38.850]  You know, Big Tree hosts the High Wire.
[02:21:39.459 --> 02:21:48.360]  And of course, the guy right there working with Kennedy and Trump on Make America Healthy Again, Maha Alliance with MAGA. Let's talk about worst case scenario.
[02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:50.520]  If they're able to steal the election and get in, what are they going to do?
[02:21:50.579 --> 02:21:51.040]  They've told us.
[02:21:51.139 --> 02:21:56.100]  I mean, Bill Gates has just come out with this whole new censorship AI system.
[02:21:56.180 --> 02:21:59.239]  He was on TV last week going, and you know, hatred and racism.
[02:21:59.340 --> 02:22:02.739]  And if somebody questions a safe shot, it's not allowed.
[02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:05.260]  But the good news is he's been indicted in the Netherlands.
[02:22:05.579 --> 02:22:05.940]  We're lying.
[02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:10.659]  I mean, as you know, the guys dodged other giant lawsuits against him before.
[02:22:10.979 --> 02:22:12.219]  But I think, rest assured...
[02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:15.809]  I've learned to take these people for their word, right?
[02:22:16.010 --> 02:22:33.930]  If they are telling you all the time that they do not believe in free speech, there's nothing in the First Amendment that says if the language is hateful, if the language is against the government, if it's misinformation or malinformation, these are all fabrications of people that are out to destroy the First Amendment.
[02:22:34.149 --> 02:22:35.010]  That's what they're saying.
[02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:37.219]  There's no caveat to free speech.
[02:22:37.379 --> 02:22:38.579]  We have had a challenge.
[02:22:38.780 --> 02:22:54.260]  We've had Jewish lawyers represent, you know, neo-Nazis that march down the street saying, look, they may be deplorable, must be, you know, we may not agree with them, but this is the United States of America, and if they're not involved in violence, then, you know, this is a free country.
[02:22:54.479 --> 02:22:55.500]  I don't agree with that.
[02:22:55.540 --> 02:22:58.020]  Let me be perfectly clear, because you know it's going to be taken out of context.
[02:22:58.139 --> 02:22:59.479]  Dale said he supports neo-Nazis.
[02:22:59.579 --> 02:23:02.700]  The point is that this has been challenged all the way through us.
[02:23:02.700 --> 02:23:07.469]  You have to support the most abhorrent speech, or everybody loses That's it, or there is no free speech.
[02:23:07.610 --> 02:23:14.430]  There's no sometimes we have free speech, or if it's inconvenient for the government, which, by the way, is the most important free speech there is.
[02:23:14.569 --> 02:23:20.030]  Well, the Democrats misrepresented what I said and did, had show trials, and admitted I was a test case from day one.
[02:23:20.030 --> 02:23:23.209]  You were supportive of it six years ago when nobody else was.
[02:23:23.479 --> 02:23:31.979]  Yeah, and Alex, I did one of my favorite interviews of all times with you, and that case against you scares the hell out of everyone, including me.
[02:23:32.399 --> 02:23:37.440]  Whether or not we make mistakes, every reporter does.
[02:23:37.659 --> 02:23:44.370]  I'm still waiting for Rachel Maddow to To apologize for saying that if you take this vaccine, the virus stops.
[02:23:44.510 --> 02:23:45.329]  It stops with you.
[02:23:45.430 --> 02:23:46.510]  It can't go forward.
[02:23:46.690 --> 02:23:48.010]  Where is your apology?
[02:23:48.270 --> 02:23:49.329]  That was a total lie.
[02:23:49.450 --> 02:23:51.770]  You guilted everybody in to take this vaccine.
[02:23:51.790 --> 02:23:54.530]  You were dead wrong by doing it.
[02:23:54.629 --> 02:23:55.809]  And where's the apology now?
[02:23:55.950 --> 02:23:56.690]  No apology.
[02:23:56.750 --> 02:23:57.329]  I haven't heard it.
[02:23:57.389 --> 02:23:58.069]  I'm still waiting.
[02:23:58.360 --> 02:24:02.020]  And now they admit what you and I said over four years ago with the experts, it erases your immune system.
[02:24:02.100 --> 02:24:10.860]  It erases your immune system, which is really, in fact, is now downgrading it so that you're vulnerable to everything and you can't mount an immune response.
[02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:15.120]  This IgG4 production, you've probably covered it, but...
[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:15.959]  Can't talk about it enough.
[02:24:16.059 --> 02:24:21.780]  It's really, really scary that it's doing the exact opposite of what we want a vaccine to do.
[02:24:21.899 --> 02:24:23.319]  If a vaccine had ever worked...
[02:24:23.319 --> 02:24:24.659]  Oh, and then a new virus comes along.
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:26.040]  Not shut it down.
[02:24:26.219 --> 02:24:26.920]  Very convenient.
[02:24:27.270 --> 02:24:28.090]  Yeah, it is.
[02:24:28.090 --> 02:24:34.889]  It's shockingly convenient, and you could jump to a lot of conspiracy theories, but as Brett Weinstein said on my show, here's all I know.
[02:24:35.430 --> 02:24:48.440]  Everyone that took that mRNA vaccine after their second or third shot is now being made more vulnerable to future COVID-19 Outbreaks or whatever we want to call these things.
[02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:56.899]  There's only one country that didn't get the mRNA vaccines that haven't created susceptibility, and it's China.
[02:24:57.440 --> 02:24:59.719]  Now maybe that's convenient, maybe it's accidental.
[02:24:59.719 --> 02:25:03.159]  There's a lot of things that happen out of stupidity.
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:05.340]  Binary weapon, come on.
[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:07.159]  Erase your immune system.
[02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:08.280]  They hit us with something later.
[02:25:08.459 --> 02:25:09.540]  And forget about it.
[02:25:09.540 --> 02:25:11.579]  We never even get to that point.
[02:25:11.739 --> 02:25:20.180]  We have so many people dying of cancer now because their immune systems cannot mount a defense, aren't recognizing that they're under attack by cancer cells.
[02:25:20.239 --> 02:25:23.659]  I was just talking to a doctor from Norway two days ago.
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:26.200]  He said cancer is skyrocketing.
[02:25:26.379 --> 02:25:31.239]  What used to take, he said it used to take between four and five years to go from stage one to stage four.
[02:25:31.420 --> 02:25:32.860]  Now it's happening in a year.
[02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:35.260]  People are just, he's like, they're just accelerating.
[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:38.360]  And every time we look, they got the COVID vaccine.
[02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:40.819]  This is just, it's- And remember the FDA document.
[02:25:41.319 --> 02:25:44.120]  Remember the FDA document in October 2000 predicted all this stuff.
[02:25:44.469 --> 02:25:44.969]  It did.
[02:25:45.229 --> 02:25:50.850]  You know, and speaking of documents, I mean, that's where I'm most proud of the work that we've done with Informed Consent Action Network.
[02:25:51.049 --> 02:25:56.950]  You know, because of our legal work, we won the Pfizer documents when they wanted to hold them back for 75 years.
[02:25:57.129 --> 02:25:58.489]  A lot of people heard this story.
[02:25:58.610 --> 02:25:59.370]  They saw the headlines.
[02:25:59.530 --> 02:26:06.430]  We don't jump up and down saying that was us because we didn't want to undermine our lawyer inside the courtrooms as he was fighting to get more and more of that data.
[02:26:06.549 --> 02:26:08.069]  But now the Pfizer data...
[02:26:08.069 --> 02:26:08.290]  That's right.
[02:26:08.329 --> 02:26:11.069]  I should have introduced you just to know who's effective.
[02:26:11.549 --> 02:26:13.610]  We're killing it.
[02:26:37.069 --> 02:26:38.629]  Text fields are now coming to us.
[02:26:38.790 --> 02:26:43.969]  We won back the religious exemption from Mississippi last year that they didn't have since 1970s.
[02:26:44.069 --> 02:26:49.989]  We just, about two or three weeks ago, won back religious exemption for all UC University schools.
[02:26:50.209 --> 02:26:56.829]  Now, starting this semester, everyone going to a UC University can now claim a religious exemption from vaccines.
[02:26:57.010 --> 02:27:01.149]  And of course, the big kahuna, we want to destroy SB 277.
[02:27:01.149 --> 02:27:08.959]  We're going to get the religious exemption back into California so that Everybody has a choice whether they want to vaccinate their child or not to go to school.
[02:27:09.159 --> 02:27:10.520]  We call it freeing the five.
[02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:12.760]  We're going after the five states that still remain.
[02:27:12.899 --> 02:27:19.780]  And all over the place, nurses and metro workers in San Francisco who were fired for not taking the shots, they're winning lawsuits.
[02:27:20.190 --> 02:27:21.270]  They're winning lawsuits.
[02:27:21.569 --> 02:27:25.049]  Some of those lawsuits are coming through, again, our work.
[02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:31.190]  We've told our lawyer we will get behind any lawsuit that gets people back their jobs, their rights.
[02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:32.329]  We won for the military.
[02:27:32.750 --> 02:27:40.450]  We sued and funded the military so that many of the Air Force were able to get reinstated after our best and brightest.
[02:27:40.489 --> 02:27:42.309]  I feel like we ought to be carrying you around on our shoulders.
[02:27:42.610 --> 02:27:46.709]  Everybody knows, but remind them, your show, the organization, how they support it.
[02:27:46.950 --> 02:27:50.270]  So thehighwire.com is where I do a weekly show every Thursday.
[02:27:50.629 --> 02:27:56.510]  You can get to icandecide.org, which is our non-profit work that funds the High Wire right now.
[02:27:56.510 --> 02:28:00.329]  I'm CEO of a super pack called mahaalliance.com.
[02:28:00.430 --> 02:28:02.549]  We're putting out the most important commercials of the moment.
[02:28:02.629 --> 02:28:05.649]  We're going to play some as we come back, but get back to the poison shots, the campaign, everything.
[02:28:05.770 --> 02:28:06.129]  Stay with us.
[02:28:06.229 --> 02:28:06.450]  All right.
[02:28:06.790 --> 02:28:17.909]  As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm dark MAGA. A few weeks ago, when I saw Elon Musk in Pennsylvania with Trump at Butler, and he had that dark MAGA hat on, I said, we've got to have our own.
[02:28:18.190 --> 02:28:19.409]  And we've come out with it.
[02:28:19.850 --> 02:28:24.709]  Yeah, we can put one out that, you know, just says, Make America Great Again, and that's available at TheAlexShowStore.com.
[02:28:24.790 --> 02:28:26.389]  But I personally like this one.
[02:28:26.950 --> 02:28:31.649]  Murdered out, it fits great, and it funds the info war and supports President Trump.
[02:28:32.110 --> 02:28:34.709]  And if you don't like Murdered Out, we got it white on black.
[02:28:34.889 --> 02:28:44.950]  So get yours right now and a bunch of other great designs of hoodies and t-shirts and top of the line supplements that all fund the second American Revolution at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:28:45.069 --> 02:28:45.889]  Let me show you a few more of these.
[02:28:46.110 --> 02:28:52.569]  Now that the FDA admits fluoride does lower your IQ and give you cancer and infertility, it's a great time to wear one of these beautiful hats.
[02:28:52.809 --> 02:28:55.129]  And it's a great way to start a conversation and warn people.
[02:28:55.290 --> 02:29:03.610]  Here's the classic Make America Great Again Murdered Out, and we've got the Save the Frogs, over 50 designs, all at thealexjonesstore.com, and it keeps us on air, and it spreads the word.
[02:29:03.770 --> 02:29:06.270]  Please go to alexjonesstore.com and get your Patriot gear.
[02:29:12.610 --> 02:29:19.569]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you wanna fight?
[02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:21.930]  You better believe you've got one!
[02:29:24.030 --> 02:29:29.030]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:29:39.389 --> 02:29:41.909]  At least for 10, 12 years, I guess, or longer.
[02:29:42.389 --> 02:29:48.850]  And of course, he's been here in Austin, maybe it's 15, with your great studios, the work you're doing, and you're always a guy in the trenches.
[02:29:49.309 --> 02:29:56.489]  And I'm familiar, follow your work every day, and know all the great stuff you've done, but I've never heard you come on air and start reporting to people.
[02:29:56.549 --> 02:29:59.729]  But I know why you did that, and I didn't talk to you during the break, but tell me if I'm wrong.
[02:30:00.450 --> 02:30:02.950]  You're giving people a report that we've got the initiative.
[02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:04.069]  We're having victories.
[02:30:04.250 --> 02:30:07.530]  Their support of the work you're doing, I can't think of anywhere.
[02:30:08.030 --> 02:30:14.170]  Trump, Elon Musk, you, Tucker Carlson, I'm in there, but it's not about credit.
[02:30:14.170 --> 02:30:20.989]  It's about betting on and amplifying and supporting and praying for and sharing the links and donating.
[02:30:21.270 --> 02:30:23.629]  You got caught off on the break as I was looking at the clock.
[02:30:24.229 --> 02:30:25.909]  Talk about the victories again.
[02:30:26.170 --> 02:30:33.270]  This is a report to the people, and What's happening and what we're going to do once Trump gets in.
[02:30:33.829 --> 02:30:38.610]  I mean, first of all, you have corruption in your regulatory agencies, which is what I've been focused on.
[02:30:38.729 --> 02:30:39.750]  It's why I'm really close to running.
[02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:42.469]  Well, was I right on the point of why you went ahead and told people all that?
[02:30:42.590 --> 02:30:45.510]  Yeah, because, look, you have to recognize we're winning, right?
[02:30:45.829 --> 02:30:47.549]  Hashtag winning is happening right now.
[02:30:47.690 --> 02:30:53.149]  But the more, it's Newton's law, you know, of equal opposites, you know.
[02:30:53.250 --> 02:30:54.350]  The harder we push, the harder they push back.
[02:30:54.370 --> 02:30:54.610]  That's it.
[02:30:54.670 --> 02:30:58.270]  The harder we push, the more we win, the more we get opposition against us.
[02:30:58.510 --> 02:30:59.569]  That's why the investigation...
[02:30:59.569 --> 02:31:00.690]  We're reaching the heart of the battle.
[02:31:00.709 --> 02:31:02.870]  We are, and we're beating the government.
[02:31:03.010 --> 02:31:05.610]  This is what I want to say, that we did differently than a non-profit.
[02:31:05.809 --> 02:31:06.469]  It's historic.
[02:31:06.750 --> 02:31:12.190]  When I started the Informed Consent Action Network, one of the things everyone was telling me, you can't sue vaccine makers.
[02:31:12.190 --> 02:31:15.229]  They're protected in 1986 by the 1986 Act.
[02:31:15.370 --> 02:31:17.850]  I found a lawyer in Aaron's Siri that said, okay...
[02:31:18.040 --> 02:31:20.520]  Maybe we can't sue the manufacturers, but you know what we're gonna do?
[02:31:20.659 --> 02:31:27.899]  We're gonna sue the government that's covering up then and is taking on the responsibility for the pharmaceutical industries and their failings in the vaccine program.
[02:31:27.899 --> 02:31:32.000]  So we started winning lawsuits against NIA, CDC, FDA, Health and Human Services.
[02:31:32.239 --> 02:31:39.399]  When they say that I'm spreading misinformation on every major media, whether it's New York Times or CNN, I say, really?
[02:31:39.639 --> 02:31:43.620]  You ought to try to win lawsuits against the government of the United States using misinformation.
[02:31:44.100 --> 02:31:48.239]  There's a reason we have the most winning track record of any non-profit.
[02:31:48.280 --> 02:31:49.540]  So we won all that.
[02:31:49.639 --> 02:31:50.739]  And then, as I said...
[02:31:50.739 --> 02:31:52.200]  And you've got MI6 coming after you.
[02:31:52.260 --> 02:31:53.920]  Yeah, we've got everyone coming after us.
[02:31:53.959 --> 02:32:00.819]  And you've got that jerk-off over in England that's sitting there trying to get us kicked off the internet.
[02:32:00.819 --> 02:32:02.180]  And that's MI6. Yes.
[02:32:03.229 --> 02:32:03.750]  Keep going, Sergeant.
[02:32:03.989 --> 02:32:10.149]  So then when the government rushed the COVID vaccine onto the people, they said, oh, we're going to be totally transparent.
[02:32:10.190 --> 02:32:11.309]  We know we're rushing it.
[02:32:11.370 --> 02:32:13.129]  We know we skipped out of the safety trials.
[02:32:13.270 --> 02:32:15.690]  Well, we said we're going to hold your feet to the fire, and we have.
[02:32:15.709 --> 02:32:23.610]  As I said before, the Pfizer data, when we said we want that data, ICANN is requesting that data through a Freedom of Information Act request.
[02:32:23.809 --> 02:32:25.209]  They said, no, you can't get it.
[02:32:25.270 --> 02:32:29.350]  We brought a lawsuit, and in that lawsuit, they ended up saying, this was against the FDA, remember?
[02:32:29.610 --> 02:32:30.569]  This wasn't against Pfizer.
[02:32:30.709 --> 02:32:34.590]  Our own FDA said, we're holding back that data for 75 years.
[02:32:34.729 --> 02:32:36.329]  And we said, are you out of your mind?
[02:32:36.489 --> 02:32:38.190]  A product that we don't know what it's doing?
[02:32:38.309 --> 02:32:39.950]  We don't know what the long-term effects are going to be?
[02:32:40.069 --> 02:32:42.850]  And we got the judge to say, that sounds crazy to me, too.
[02:32:42.969 --> 02:32:45.010]  In fact, you know, I don't know where the judge got the shot.
[02:32:45.170 --> 02:32:45.770]  Probably did.
[02:32:45.829 --> 02:32:48.129]  But he's probably thinking, I'd like to see that data, too.
[02:32:48.270 --> 02:32:49.629]  So we won that lawsuit.
[02:32:49.690 --> 02:32:50.690]  But they lied, Alex.
[02:32:50.909 --> 02:32:54.489]  They said, well, we only have, you know, 5 million pages of documents.
[02:32:54.530 --> 02:32:55.090]  Yeah, they slow-roll.
[02:32:55.120 --> 02:32:56.260]  So we said, okay.
[02:32:56.500 --> 02:32:59.799]  And the judge said, well, five million, this many per day gets us to five million.
[02:32:59.920 --> 02:33:02.500]  The year came up and we were still getting data.
[02:33:02.620 --> 02:33:03.700]  We're like, wait, why is there still data?
[02:33:03.780 --> 02:33:04.719]  We're supposed to have all of it.
[02:33:04.940 --> 02:33:09.319]  We went back to court, said to the judge, FDA actually lied to us for Pfizer.
[02:33:09.540 --> 02:33:11.260]  They have millions of more documents.
[02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:14.420]  Judge went crazy, admonished the Department of Justice.
[02:33:14.680 --> 02:33:16.639]  They had to give us more documents every day.
[02:33:16.760 --> 02:33:18.920]  Then we got the Moderna data coming in.
[02:33:19.020 --> 02:33:19.739]  That's pouring in.
[02:33:19.860 --> 02:33:23.239]  Then we got the V-Safe, which was this app that the CDC made.
[02:33:23.549 --> 02:33:26.590]  Handed out to everybody in the vaccine so they could track their health outcomes.
[02:33:26.770 --> 02:33:30.129]  That thing's a total scam because the only thing they asked about was, do you have a headache?
[02:33:30.309 --> 02:33:31.250]  Do you have swelling in the arm?
[02:33:31.469 --> 02:33:32.069]  Forget about it.
[02:33:32.090 --> 02:33:34.469]  Did you get a blood clot like we were seeing in all of our trials?
[02:33:34.469 --> 02:33:35.569]  Did you have a heart attack?
[02:33:36.649 --> 02:33:37.569]  Turbo cancer?
[02:33:37.950 --> 02:33:38.530]  Turbo cancer?
[02:33:38.559 --> 02:33:42.600]  None of those questions, but they did have this box where you had to write in.
[02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:45.200]  If we haven't asked you the question, anything else happened?
[02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:47.420]  Well, they gave us all of the push button.
[02:33:47.620 --> 02:33:48.600]  I had a headache data.
[02:33:48.739 --> 02:33:57.520]  And in that data, by the way, Alex, we discovered that more than 30% of the people that got the COVID vaccine either missed work, school, or were hospitalized.
[02:33:57.920 --> 02:33:59.840]  That is a horrible product.
[02:34:00.100 --> 02:34:02.420]  One in three could not perform.
[02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:05.139]  And the medical system is incentivized to cover it up.
[02:34:05.489 --> 02:34:05.889]  Correct.
[02:34:06.049 --> 02:34:09.950]  And so all of that's available because of the work my nonprofit's doing.
[02:34:10.209 --> 02:34:18.530]  And to bring it back to your point, the only way we can do these things, I'm not getting funded by Pfizer or Moderna or Exxon or Pampers or Coca-Cola.
[02:34:18.770 --> 02:34:19.850]  Neither are you.
[02:34:19.989 --> 02:34:22.069]  And this is what's so important for us right now.
[02:34:22.530 --> 02:34:27.090]  You and I, we should not be competing over the same donations from the same people.
[02:34:27.090 --> 02:34:32.870]  But those people that are donating to both you and I have to recognize you are the future of the world right now.
[02:34:33.049 --> 02:34:38.309]  It's only these, you know, groups like ours that need your personal funding that make this happen.
[02:34:38.450 --> 02:34:42.930]  And it's not like we're not winning either.
[02:34:43.090 --> 02:34:44.510]  Now we're pushing it over the top.
[02:34:44.649 --> 02:34:46.069]  We have an amazing track record.
[02:34:46.129 --> 02:34:47.309]  That's what I say every single week.
[02:34:47.430 --> 02:34:51.670]  Who else is winning, you know, against the government of the United States of America?
[02:34:51.889 --> 02:34:52.590]  And so...
[02:34:52.590 --> 02:34:54.069]  But you listed all the stuff you're doing.
[02:34:54.170 --> 02:34:55.729]  I mean, these new ads are just...
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:34:56.139]  We're killing it.
[02:34:56.180 --> 02:34:57.559]  So now let's get to the ads.
[02:34:58.120 --> 02:34:59.799]  That's my non-profit work.
[02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:01.239]  Give us all the websites first.
[02:35:01.459 --> 02:35:04.219]  Okay, so first of all, all that, thehighwire.com.
[02:35:04.219 --> 02:35:05.979]  We talk about all the wins we've had.
[02:35:06.899 --> 02:35:09.340]  Icandecide.org is our white papers on the issues.
[02:35:09.340 --> 02:35:11.079]  If you're questioning vaccines...
[02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:28.959]  We're good to go.
[02:35:33.049 --> 02:35:36.389]  But I was, you know, running all the media for Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:35:36.670 --> 02:35:41.209]  I feel really good about the fact that, you know, we got some of Vivek's people when he dropped out.
[02:35:41.370 --> 02:35:48.209]  Some of his media team came over and they said, you know, guys, your media, your social media, you were the standard.
[02:35:48.430 --> 02:36:02.889]  We're good to go.
[02:36:04.680 --> 02:36:08.059]  They turned to me and said, Del, look, we know what we're doing here.
[02:36:08.139 --> 02:36:11.360]  You've got to go out and help the Kennedy voters move over to Donald Trump.
[02:36:11.479 --> 02:36:13.120]  You've got to start running ads on television.
[02:36:13.319 --> 02:36:14.940]  You've got to run ads on social media.
[02:36:15.100 --> 02:36:18.559]  So I started Maha Alliance just over a month ago.
[02:36:18.639 --> 02:36:24.200]  And if you go to our website, Maha Alliance, look how many commercials we made in just about two and a half weeks.
[02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:26.459]  I think they're the best commercials you're going to see.
[02:36:26.639 --> 02:36:26.799]  They are.
[02:36:26.899 --> 02:36:32.440]  And really, the reason it's important, the work that we're doing, is, you know, I think Donald Trump has an incredible base.
[02:36:32.579 --> 02:36:33.959]  The MAGA base has been powerful.
[02:36:34.020 --> 02:36:35.600]  In many ways, it's been immovable.
[02:36:35.659 --> 02:36:39.579]  But in so many ways, as you said, he'll probably win.
[02:36:39.579 --> 02:36:44.040]  But will it be enough to overcome any skullduggery, as Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:36:44.239 --> 02:36:44.620]  calls it?
[02:36:45.420 --> 02:36:48.559]  I think it's Maha, make America healthy again.
[02:36:48.899 --> 02:36:50.040]  It's those Kennedy voters.
[02:36:50.159 --> 02:36:55.860]  They were at about 8% to 10% when they did the last poll of Kamala, Robert Kennedy Jr., and President Trump.
[02:36:55.860 --> 02:36:56.540]  And let's just say it.
[02:36:56.620 --> 02:36:57.959]  Trump won't admit he's wrong.
[02:36:58.159 --> 02:37:01.340]  He wasn't 10% as bad as the Democrats trying to make us take the shots.
[02:37:01.479 --> 02:37:02.059]  He got set up.
[02:37:02.159 --> 02:37:03.899]  I think we should talk all about that.
[02:37:04.700 --> 02:37:05.420]  Let's do that then.
[02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:06.200]  We'll do the ads.
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:12.020]  But bringing Kennedy in is his way of doing it and letting us know that he's not going to go down that anymore.
[02:37:12.040 --> 02:37:13.120]  We have the tape getting leaked.
[02:37:13.219 --> 02:37:16.920]  It shouldn't have gotten leaked, but it's Trump admitting, yeah, the shot's probably not good for kids.
[02:37:17.180 --> 02:37:18.840]  Trump will never admit he's wrong.
[02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:19.479]  It's part of his strength.
[02:37:19.579 --> 02:37:20.139]  It's also a weakness.
[02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:21.579]  But look, give us the inside baseball.
[02:37:21.979 --> 02:37:24.739]  Because Trump's for real, but he also makes mistakes.
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:25.979]  But this shows how real he is.
[02:37:26.180 --> 02:37:30.180]  I mean, look, I think that we all see in Donald Trump, this guy's a winner, right?
[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:33.020]  He's not really big on talking about his losses.
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:34.280]  Everybody takes losses.
[02:37:34.559 --> 02:37:36.299]  You know, we all have, you know...
[02:37:36.299 --> 02:37:39.059]  Yeah, Rogan, in the interview this weekend, is like, what have you done wrong?
[02:37:39.139 --> 02:37:42.459]  And Trump goes, well, I did all this good stuff, but yeah, I let bad guys in.
[02:37:43.290 --> 02:37:50.110]  One of my favorite quotes is Winston Churchill, you know, success is moving from failure to failure and never losing your enthusiasm.
[02:37:50.450 --> 02:37:50.690]  Yes.
[02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:51.430]  You know what I mean?
[02:37:51.549 --> 02:37:55.409]  In many ways, when you're fighting the beast the way that you are, you're going to take some big hits.
[02:37:55.829 --> 02:38:00.989]  I think President Trump admits, what he is admitting publicly is, I did get swamp creatures.
[02:38:00.989 --> 02:38:02.309]  I did let swamp creatures in.
[02:38:02.309 --> 02:38:05.090]  I know I promised all of you I was going to drain the swamp.
[02:38:05.250 --> 02:38:10.930]  I wasn't really aware that I had to fill like 5,000 to 10,000 positions within three months of winning.
[02:38:10.930 --> 02:38:11.670]  And they lie to you.
[02:38:12.100 --> 02:38:13.360]  I promise they're going to follow the agenda.
[02:38:13.719 --> 02:38:14.840]  But who are you going to turn to?
[02:38:14.940 --> 02:38:18.340]  Who knows anything about, you know, oil and gas?
[02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:22.940]  Who knows about, I mean, you end up going to the guys that are drilling to say, hey, could you work in my government?
[02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:23.700]  And you said the key.
[02:38:23.979 --> 02:38:27.319]  The bureaucrats will sabotage you if you don't get rid of all of them.
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:27.860]  That's it.
[02:38:27.979 --> 02:38:36.479]  And so if you only need a couple to remain around to just contaminate everything that's going on, I think you and I think one of the greatest mistakes of all times is Tony Fauci.
[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:39.280]  I mean, this guy was just an absolute disaster.
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:39.979]  And Pompeo.
[02:38:40.159 --> 02:38:43.180]  You know, and Pompeo, you know, and these are swamp creatures.
[02:38:43.340 --> 02:38:46.280]  I mean, Tony Fauci's been there longer than anyone on the planet.
[02:38:46.379 --> 02:38:49.920]  I mean, you know, at least as far as being a part of the U.S. government paid higher.
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:50.680]  Master criminal.
[02:38:51.079 --> 02:38:52.219]  But I wanna say this.
[02:38:52.639 --> 02:38:53.879]  You know what I wanna say about Trump?
[02:38:53.959 --> 02:38:55.299]  This is my perspective of his vaccine.
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:38:57.139]  I wish I could get him to say it like this.
[02:38:57.239 --> 02:39:01.879]  And Donald, if you're listening, here's what I think his answer should be when asked about COVID or the vaccines.
[02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:03.700]  This is what I saw him do.
[02:39:03.879 --> 02:39:07.000]  I think he should say, I was president for the United States of America.
[02:39:07.430 --> 02:39:07.750]  All right?
[02:39:07.889 --> 02:39:17.090]  So when a pandemic came, you know, that was unlike anything we'd seen in certainly my lifetime, you know, in most of our lifetime, as president, what did he do?
[02:39:17.209 --> 02:39:22.969]  For everyone that wanted a vaccine, he made a vaccine faster than anyone in the history of the presidency.
[02:39:23.329 --> 02:39:26.250]  Funded more money to get that vaccine, raced through.
[02:39:26.409 --> 02:39:30.649]  Those of us that don't like vaccines, weren't crazy about it, but for everyone that does, they loved him.
[02:39:30.790 --> 02:39:31.909]  But he didn't stop there.
[02:39:32.030 --> 02:39:38.889]  He also said if you want a drug to be available, if there's some drug that already exists that could do this, he discovered hydroxychloroquine.
[02:39:38.989 --> 02:39:42.709]  He was listening to Didier Ryut and Zelensky.
[02:39:42.850 --> 02:39:45.110]  I mean, what's his name in New York?
[02:39:45.690 --> 02:39:45.889]  Zelenko.
[02:39:46.090 --> 02:39:46.489]  Zelenko.
[02:39:46.590 --> 02:39:46.950]  Zelenko.
[02:39:47.049 --> 02:39:47.409]  Thank you.
[02:39:47.969 --> 02:39:51.389]  And he brought it forward to the country and said, look, there's this drug.
[02:39:51.389 --> 02:39:53.670]  He opened the floodgates, and in that, the bad guy's got it.
[02:39:53.690 --> 02:39:53.889]  Right.
[02:39:53.930 --> 02:39:58.049]  He said, look, everyone in this country, hydroxychloroquine looks like it works.
[02:39:58.190 --> 02:39:59.090]  You don't have to take it.
[02:39:59.270 --> 02:40:00.170]  And ivermectin.
[02:40:00.270 --> 02:40:01.530]  But he took them himself.
[02:40:01.770 --> 02:40:02.750]  I mean, we'll talk about a leader.
[02:40:02.950 --> 02:40:04.629]  This guy didn't just say, I like this drug.
[02:40:04.750 --> 02:40:06.989]  He started taking hydroxychloroquine himself.
[02:40:07.190 --> 02:40:07.969]  And monoclonals.
[02:40:08.110 --> 02:40:13.069]  That's a general that charged the bunker and said, I'm going to try it on myself in front of everybody.
[02:40:13.290 --> 02:40:15.709]  Yeah, they panicked him into going along with them.
[02:40:15.809 --> 02:40:16.110]  Correct.
[02:40:16.370 --> 02:40:18.829]  But then, this is what I truly believe about him.
[02:40:18.870 --> 02:40:19.969]  There's a third category.
[02:40:20.129 --> 02:40:31.629]  And I think he should say, for all of you that don't like ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, no pharmaceutical product at all, no vaccines, you want to drink orange juice, you want to jog down the road, and you want to handle everything naturally, guess what?
[02:40:31.750 --> 02:40:33.250]  This is the United States of America.
[02:40:33.250 --> 02:40:34.090]  It's a free country.
[02:40:34.090 --> 02:40:37.559]  I'm never going to mandate Any drug or vaccine on you.
[02:40:37.739 --> 02:40:39.840]  And that is something that he has always said.
[02:40:39.860 --> 02:40:44.440]  We do not see a mandate from him of any kind, not of the COVID vaccine or any of it.
[02:40:44.559 --> 02:40:46.959]  Of course, it all sort of happened right after he left.
[02:40:47.059 --> 02:40:48.559]  But I do believe him there.
[02:40:48.700 --> 02:40:51.399]  And so really, what more do we want in a president?
[02:40:51.540 --> 02:40:52.860]  Someone that says, you like vaccines?
[02:40:52.940 --> 02:40:53.559]  Here's a vaccine.
[02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:54.840]  You want an existing drug?
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:55.500]  Here's a drug.
[02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:59.799]  You want the freedom to take vitamins and run down the road and not wear a mask or do anything because it's a free country?
[02:41:00.020 --> 02:41:01.000]  Hey, I'm your president.
[02:41:01.399 --> 02:41:03.299]  That is what a president's supposed to do in America.
[02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:04.659]  That's it.
[02:41:05.530 --> 02:41:06.129]  That's it.
[02:41:06.530 --> 02:41:11.229]  Wow, so there are concerns, there should be concerns, because it's a huge job.
[02:41:11.329 --> 02:41:12.809]  I have a small company, small crew.
[02:41:12.950 --> 02:41:15.309]  If they weren't behind me putting up with me, we couldn't get anything done.
[02:41:15.690 --> 02:41:21.729]  Imagine hundreds of thousands of employees, bureaucrats, liars, intelligence agencies, fake leakers, all of it.
[02:41:22.170 --> 02:41:32.190]  Trump is taking on a Herculean feat of the Aegean stables here, and he's bringing in great people to help him, but now is the time to be getting ready, and then once he's president-elect...
[02:41:33.420 --> 02:41:34.879]  I know a lot of that's happened behind the scenes.
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:39.340]  Where are you right now is your prognosis on how this draining of the swamp is going to go?
[02:41:39.479 --> 02:41:41.299]  Well, look, I think you just said it exactly.
[02:41:41.319 --> 02:41:42.600]  You have to do it ahead of time.
[02:41:42.719 --> 02:41:44.200]  You have to be prepared ahead of time.
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:46.219]  And that's exactly what's going on right now.
[02:41:46.340 --> 02:41:48.940]  There is a transition team, not like the last time he ran.
[02:41:49.159 --> 02:41:50.079]  Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:41:50.180 --> 02:41:55.180]  is in meetings right now with Amaryllis Kennedy, who was our campaign director.
[02:41:55.899 --> 02:41:57.239]  They're already a part of the team.
[02:41:57.559 --> 02:41:58.920]  Tulsi Gabbard is on the team.
[02:41:59.139 --> 02:42:06.260]  She's assembling the people that she thinks need to be taking, the people that need to be coming out of the CIA, the ones that need to be going in.
[02:42:06.379 --> 02:42:08.079]  Those that are going to be in the State Department.
[02:42:08.219 --> 02:42:08.879]  Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:42:08.959 --> 02:42:13.500]  is looking at the FDA, the CDC, Health and Human Services, NIH. Who should be leading these organizations?
[02:42:13.719 --> 02:42:20.059]  How deep into this bench do we need to go before we can get to real clarity, real sanity?
[02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:24.219]  And they know the change is real because the establishment is running around crazy.
[02:42:24.599 --> 02:42:24.959]  Absolutely.
[02:42:25.219 --> 02:42:27.459]  And that's one of the things I think we should feel the best about.
[02:42:27.780 --> 02:42:30.819]  When people are like, aren't you afraid the election is going to be stolen?
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:31.840]  I'll say this.
[02:42:32.180 --> 02:42:41.979]  Based on the way I see Hillary coming out and Barack Obama and Kamala and the attacks and the Nazis and the this and that, they are running with their hair on fire.
[02:42:42.139 --> 02:42:44.420]  If they thought they could rig this election, I don't think they'd be looking at this.
[02:42:44.420 --> 02:42:46.739]  Look at the lip reading video two weeks ago that was confirmed.
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:47.780]  They're like panicking.
[02:42:47.940 --> 02:42:48.799]  They are panicking.
[02:42:48.979 --> 02:42:52.559]  I mean, the fact that they were going to think about putting Joe Biden back into the last minute.
[02:42:53.319 --> 02:42:56.700]  But look at the choice they gave America.
[02:42:57.020 --> 02:43:00.100]  A woman in Kamala Harris, I have nothing against women.
[02:43:00.100 --> 02:43:04.000]  In fact, I think Tulsi Gabbard will be the first female president of this country.
[02:43:04.139 --> 02:43:05.040]  She is dynamic.
[02:43:05.159 --> 02:43:06.379]  She is brilliant.
[02:43:06.639 --> 02:43:07.680]  She is strong.
[02:43:07.700 --> 02:43:09.899]  She's a soldier but doesn't want war.
[02:43:10.020 --> 02:43:13.040]  But she's also feminine and beautiful and wonderful.
[02:43:13.260 --> 02:43:13.559]  She's got it all.
[02:43:13.760 --> 02:43:18.420]  She's got it all and she's gonna represent women the way they want to be represented as far as I'm concerned.
[02:43:18.540 --> 02:43:22.180]  Yeah, what does it have to women to hire the most unsavory, creepy woman?
[02:43:22.340 --> 02:43:26.059]  A woman won't be present for another 100 years if Kamala gets in.
[02:43:26.139 --> 02:43:28.020]  They'll be like, oh my God, we're never doing that again.
[02:43:28.299 --> 02:43:30.120]  I mean, she can't answer a question.
[02:43:30.219 --> 02:43:32.239]  She doesn't have a single policy idea.
[02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:51.520]  We're good to go.
[02:43:54.299 --> 02:43:59.459]  She reminds me of Miss South Carolina when she goes, tough Africa such as...
[02:43:59.459 --> 02:44:00.520]  Right, I know, right.
[02:44:00.840 --> 02:44:04.840]  Guys, pull up the famous clip of Miss South Carolina beauty pageant.
[02:44:05.739 --> 02:44:07.739]  I mean, that's what Kamala comes off like.
[02:44:07.920 --> 02:44:08.200]  It does feel that way.
[02:44:08.200 --> 02:44:09.719]  Have you seen her in her new preacher voice?
[02:44:10.100 --> 02:44:11.459]  I did.
[02:44:11.459 --> 02:44:12.159]  I just saw that.
[02:44:12.260 --> 02:44:16.540]  The way that she keeps changing accents depending on who she's talking to.
[02:44:16.540 --> 02:44:17.420]  That is scary.
[02:44:18.319 --> 02:44:19.040]  It is.
[02:44:19.739 --> 02:44:21.440]  There's so much that is scary.
[02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:24.159]  But the most scary part is forget about what she isn't saying.
[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:26.059]  What she is saying is censorship.
[02:44:26.319 --> 02:44:29.360]  What she is saying is they're coming and Waltz is saying it.
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:30.819]  You know, you've got John Kerry.
[02:44:30.979 --> 02:44:35.020]  You see John Kerry in that statement he made at the WEF. First Amendment's the problem.
[02:44:35.100 --> 02:44:35.780]  Yeah, it's getting in the way.
[02:44:35.780 --> 02:44:36.940]  He also said farms.
[02:44:37.120 --> 02:44:38.819]  If we don't get rid of farms, we'll starve.
[02:44:39.090 --> 02:44:39.350]  Right.
[02:44:39.809 --> 02:44:40.690]  No, amazing.
[02:44:40.909 --> 02:44:42.329]  And saying things like...
[02:44:42.329 --> 02:44:43.889]  We don't cut our leg off, we'll bleed to death.
[02:44:43.989 --> 02:44:44.290]  What did he say?
[02:44:44.649 --> 02:44:50.909]  Democracy, you know, democracy, he's like, I think that we may be proving that it just is moving too slow for the modern times.
[02:44:51.719 --> 02:44:52.459]  So it's over.
[02:44:52.659 --> 02:44:53.079]  That's it.
[02:44:53.139 --> 02:44:53.920]  We're throwing in the towel.
[02:44:54.040 --> 02:44:55.659]  Let's just go back to authoritarianism.
[02:44:55.739 --> 02:44:57.920]  These people are promising.
[02:44:58.139 --> 02:44:59.959]  And again, what are they saying to us?
[02:45:00.100 --> 02:45:01.860]  They're all talking about depopulation.
[02:45:02.180 --> 02:45:16.239]  When Bill Gates says to you, we need to reduce the population worldwide, and then his number one most invested in product is the current vaccine, and then every test for COVID he's getting paid for, and he's behind the entire COVID pandemic.
[02:45:16.260 --> 02:45:19.260]  And tens of millions are linked to And then who did it kill?
[02:45:19.459 --> 02:45:20.200]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:27.659]  What I saw in the United States of America, it appeared to be killing the entire pension class in the United States of America and the rest of the world.
[02:45:27.719 --> 02:45:33.659]  So everybody that they've already spent their pensions on God knows what and their Social Security, you know, it'd be a really good answer.
[02:45:33.780 --> 02:45:38.159]  Jeez, if you could just kill everyone over the age of 70, that'd be amazing.
[02:45:38.459 --> 02:45:43.260]  And that's what this vaccine, it's what the pandemic seemed to do.
[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:52.780]  And They got away with it for a while, but would you agree with me that accelerating the global awakening to historic proportions and the global realignment is the poison shot?
[02:45:53.670 --> 02:45:54.329]  I agree.
[02:45:54.530 --> 02:45:58.250]  I think the greatest thing, I mean, really, it's one of those double-edged swords.
[02:45:58.350 --> 02:46:03.649]  The greatest thing that happened to our movement and any movement towards truth was the COVID pandemic.
[02:46:03.989 --> 02:46:10.829]  Because what it did was, for me, I was almost strictly into a vaccine investigation on the high wire.
[02:46:10.930 --> 02:46:13.569]  It's a huge part of what we did after I made the film Vaxxed.
[02:46:13.629 --> 02:46:22.610]  But when we watched COVID ramping up and then Donald Trump said we're warped speeding the vaccine, I sat my team down and said, this is the moment we've been waiting for.
[02:46:22.940 --> 02:46:25.440]  Now it's no longer going to be about the childhood vaccines.
[02:46:25.600 --> 02:46:30.200]  And for whatever reason, and I was starting to say to Alex, to people, go, I can't win this, argue my family.
[02:46:30.340 --> 02:46:31.840]  I said, stop talking about the kids.
[02:46:32.159 --> 02:46:35.020]  People will put their kids in front of those vaccines and not think twice.
[02:46:35.180 --> 02:46:38.739]  Just turn it and say, you know that they're about to have adult vaccine mandates?
[02:46:39.040 --> 02:46:39.360]  What?
[02:46:39.479 --> 02:46:39.600]  No.
[02:46:39.739 --> 02:46:41.840]  Over my dead body, suddenly the conversation changed.
[02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:44.479]  They just got 72 vaccines in their...
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:49.200]  Baby, but you tell them they're about to be vaccinated themselves and the whole conversation changed.
[02:46:49.340 --> 02:46:54.399]  So I was saying all along, it's going to be the adult vaccine mandate that's going to change this conversation forever.
[02:46:54.399 --> 02:46:55.079]  That was the jumping.
[02:46:55.379 --> 02:46:56.219]  That was the jump.
[02:46:56.479 --> 02:46:57.239]  That's what happened.
[02:46:57.260 --> 02:46:57.799]  Jumping of the shark.
[02:46:57.959 --> 02:47:07.620]  As soon as they decided, oh, we're going to force vaccinate adults, an adult that was Jogging down the street yesterday is now laid up in a bed with seizures and has blood clots and is dying.
[02:47:07.979 --> 02:47:09.440]  Many of them doctors and lawyers.
[02:47:09.600 --> 02:47:10.639]  They can talk.
[02:47:10.799 --> 02:47:12.879]  They're not an infant trying to express to their mom.
[02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:14.319]  A mom saying, I don't know.
[02:47:14.420 --> 02:47:16.620]  They were focusing on me before they got the vaccine.
[02:47:16.620 --> 02:47:17.799]  After all, you're crazy.
[02:47:17.920 --> 02:47:21.819]  What about the new development where there's kids that parents did protect them?
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:25.120]  They're having kids that are totally on the soccer team when they're five.
[02:47:25.299 --> 02:47:27.000]  Now they're vegetables from shots.
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:29.000]  Now it's happening to kids that can sing.
[02:47:29.139 --> 02:47:32.180]  And kids on the soccer field dropping over with heart attacks.
[02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:43.760]  We have, you know, we have kids all across the world, young athletes in the prime of their careers, grabbing their chests and falling forward on basketball courts, on football fields, on soccer fields.
[02:47:43.899 --> 02:47:46.379]  We've never seen anything like this.
[02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:53.159]  And so all of that, I mean, as tragic as it is, I guess it's like, you know, Shakespeare said, all of life is a stage.
[02:47:53.500 --> 02:47:54.840]  Somebody's got to play the bad guy.
[02:47:55.049 --> 02:47:56.850]  And somebody's got to play the people that died.
[02:47:57.010 --> 02:48:03.989]  And so that's what I really came to terms with during COVID, was I was getting so angry with people that weren't listening to me that were taking this vaccine.
[02:48:03.989 --> 02:48:06.069]  And finally, I just said, you know what?
[02:48:06.389 --> 02:48:07.809]  They're playing their part.
[02:48:07.909 --> 02:48:14.090]  It is going to be the millions of people that end up dying from having taken that that will make sure that we never do this again.
[02:48:14.229 --> 02:48:24.659]  But that's only going to be the case if voices like yours, voices like mine, Joe Rogan's, You know, Tucker Carlson, people, all of us have been kicked out of mainstream because it's owned by our enemies.
[02:48:24.659 --> 02:48:25.979]  It's owned by darkness.
[02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:29.440]  But we're seeing the end of the establishment where none of it works anymore.
[02:48:29.659 --> 02:48:31.540]  And the independent media is the new media.
[02:48:31.540 --> 02:48:35.639]  And now we've reached a tipping point where all the top talk show hosts, which I'm saying more competition.
[02:48:35.940 --> 02:48:36.760]  I love it.
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:38.819]  I'm not in competition with other people.
[02:48:38.860 --> 02:48:40.540]  I'm in competition with the lie of the globalist.
[02:48:40.639 --> 02:48:41.559]  I want to be made obsolete.
[02:48:41.799 --> 02:48:44.819]  And so now I can look at it politically with a cold, hard thing.
[02:48:44.959 --> 02:48:46.680]  They'll never put the genie back in the bottle.
[02:48:46.790 --> 02:48:47.270]  I agree.
[02:48:47.389 --> 02:48:48.209]  There's no going back.
[02:48:48.389 --> 02:48:49.149]  There's just too much out.
[02:48:49.309 --> 02:48:53.870]  There's too many great scientists are now looking at all the things that were called conspiracy theories.
[02:48:54.069 --> 02:49:03.030]  Even when the COVID vaccine was first really failing, you know, the early on Robert Malone, the Peter McAuliffe's, they were still saying, oh, but the childhood vaccine is great.
[02:49:03.170 --> 02:49:03.950]  It's just this vaccine.
[02:49:04.030 --> 02:49:06.809]  And I was pulling them aside saying, I want you to look at our data.
[02:49:06.950 --> 02:49:11.809]  Well, now you have great scientists like McAuliffe, like Malone, Brent Weinstein.
[02:49:12.090 --> 02:49:16.030]  All of these people have started doing the research and they're coming back to me saying, Del, my God.
[02:49:16.520 --> 02:49:17.100]  I'm shocked.
[02:49:17.100 --> 02:49:18.399]  There's no science here.
[02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:20.500]  How did the vaccine program get as far down the road?
[02:49:20.500 --> 02:49:23.680]  And it's because they're good people and it's hard for them to imagine something as evil.
[02:49:23.799 --> 02:49:23.959]  It is.
[02:49:23.959 --> 02:49:28.739]  But you know about the FDA document back in 2000 where they're all sitting around saying, oh my God, we've got to cover this up.
[02:49:28.819 --> 02:49:29.159]  They've known.
[02:49:29.540 --> 02:49:29.899]  That's it.
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:30.700]  They didn't know.
[02:49:30.879 --> 02:49:32.040]  They hadn't done their research.
[02:49:32.219 --> 02:49:42.180]  They were under the assumption that somehow in the last 50 years of medicine and science around this vaccine program, good science must have been done to say that this is making kids healthier.
[02:49:42.319 --> 02:49:51.790]  But as soon as you investigate it, When you finally look and you go down the rabbit hole, nobody with blood moving through their brain can come away with a conclusion that the vaccine program is working.
[02:49:52.010 --> 02:50:04.389]  Well, I remember- It's destroying health in this country, and I stand by that, and I challenge anyone at the New York Times, anyone at the Washington Post, you show me one safety trial that used a placebo prior to licensing that product.
[02:50:04.389 --> 02:50:05.350]  You can't do it.
[02:50:05.409 --> 02:50:06.370]  You've said it's misinformation.
[02:50:06.670 --> 02:50:07.450]  It's a fact.
[02:50:07.590 --> 02:50:11.030]  Tony Fauci said it to our face the first time Donald Trump- You know about this?
[02:50:11.129 --> 02:50:14.629]  Donald Trump said Bobby Kennedy and me- All the way back in 2017.
[02:50:15.069 --> 02:50:24.870]  And a bunch of scientists said, go to the NIH. Bring all of your problems with the vaccine program in front of Tony Fauci, Francis Collins, and all the luminaries of our vaccine development programs.
[02:50:25.069 --> 02:50:25.709]  And we said, hey.
[02:50:25.709 --> 02:50:27.309]  We're all invested in the vaccine companies.
[02:50:27.510 --> 02:50:27.510]  That's it.
[02:50:27.510 --> 02:50:28.049]  We went there.
[02:50:28.069 --> 02:50:32.170]  We're like, hey, we can't find a single placebo trial of any of the childhood vaccines.
[02:50:32.370 --> 02:50:33.489]  What is going on here?
[02:50:33.549 --> 02:50:35.629]  Are you doing them and not showing anybody?
[02:50:35.829 --> 02:50:39.129]  Or are you just skipping the only safety test there actually is?
[02:50:39.250 --> 02:50:43.409]  In the end, they said we don't do placebo trials because it'd be unethical.
[02:50:43.649 --> 02:50:46.170]  And then we said this, and this is the biggest thing I said.
[02:50:46.409 --> 02:50:47.229]  So instead you just tested on everybody.
[02:50:47.459 --> 02:50:55.819]  Instead, the entire world is your test, and there's no way to absolutely, there's no post-marketing surveillance systems accurate enough to figure out.
[02:50:55.840 --> 02:50:58.559]  They'll just tell you, well, it's correlation, not causation.
[02:50:59.600 --> 02:51:02.459]  And now they've gone further with mRNA that's not even of action.
[02:51:02.600 --> 02:51:03.040]  Oh, my God.
[02:51:03.239 --> 02:51:05.200]  Now we're in Scaryville, right?
[02:51:05.379 --> 02:51:08.340]  Now you're messing with your DNA. And I just did an interview.
[02:51:08.520 --> 02:51:10.879]  I don't know if you've had on Naomi Wolf yet.
[02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:11.520]  Have you had her on?
[02:51:12.260 --> 02:51:13.379]  It's amazing.
[02:51:13.719 --> 02:51:18.940]  Because she's looking at the data that we won from the Informed Consent Action Network, the Pfizer data right now.
[02:51:18.979 --> 02:51:23.399]  And what she's saying is there's a shocking amount of investigation into fertility.
[02:51:23.770 --> 02:51:29.750]  This was a vaccine that was supposed to be about your lungs, about an upper respiratory condition.
[02:51:29.829 --> 02:51:35.030]  But it seems that all these people, the real trials they're doing on is, did you lose your period?
[02:51:35.190 --> 02:51:36.530]  Did you hemorrhage in your period?
[02:51:36.670 --> 02:51:38.090]  What happened to your eggs?
[02:51:38.290 --> 02:51:39.709]  Did your sperm last?
[02:51:39.870 --> 02:51:43.370]  What's happening to the testes of a baby when their mother's vaccinated?
[02:51:43.469 --> 02:51:48.250]  They're testing the effectiveness of their weapon.
[02:51:48.430 --> 02:51:49.209]  That's it.
[02:51:49.309 --> 02:51:50.190]  Did you see the show?
[02:51:50.659 --> 02:51:51.219]  Look at it.
[02:51:51.260 --> 02:51:57.500]  The show, Utopia, like 10 years ago in England, and three years ago, four years ago, it came out right before, six years ago.
[02:51:57.620 --> 02:51:59.659]  It's all about what they actually did.
[02:51:59.840 --> 02:52:00.059]  Yeah.
[02:52:00.239 --> 02:52:00.959]  They even tell you.
[02:52:01.100 --> 02:52:02.079]  They told you.
[02:52:02.620 --> 02:52:07.700]  The entire practice, they did the run-through that Mickey Welles talks about so brilliantly.
[02:52:08.100 --> 02:52:10.200]  They were practicing on what?
[02:52:10.670 --> 02:52:13.290]  A COVID virus sweeping the world.
[02:52:13.530 --> 02:52:19.690]  I mean, they did a whole practice run through on how we're going to have to get everybody to mask and how we're going to have to ramp up a vaccine.
[02:52:20.010 --> 02:52:24.569]  You know, it was like a table read for a movie we all lived through a year later.
[02:52:24.930 --> 02:52:25.290]  Exactly.
[02:52:25.510 --> 02:52:28.229]  And people asked how I knew, you know, videos from 14 years ago.
[02:52:28.790 --> 02:52:47.389]  We're good to go.
[02:52:48.300 --> 02:52:50.219]  Well, and I think- You know about that, right?
[02:52:50.399 --> 02:52:51.360]  I do know about that.
[02:52:51.520 --> 02:52:51.520]  Crazy.
[02:52:51.520 --> 02:52:54.620]  And I actually think we sort of rushed, we might have rushed their game.
[02:52:55.120 --> 02:52:58.940]  One of my theories, you know, Alex, is that we were having so much success.
[02:52:59.139 --> 02:52:59.940]  You'd been- Hold on, stay there.
[02:52:59.979 --> 02:53:00.700]  We're going to start the next hour.
[02:53:00.780 --> 02:53:01.120]  Let's do it.
[02:53:01.139 --> 02:53:10.260]  And I want to get back in to where we're going, this, I want to play the ads, the campaign, Trump, what we do if they try to steal it, how we respond if they do, which I think is too big to rig.
[02:53:10.479 --> 02:53:14.469]  I'm already seeing signs of capitulation to Trump right now in- I feel like that's the case.
[02:53:14.690 --> 02:53:15.670]  Well, you're an expert on this.
[02:53:15.709 --> 02:53:16.709]  You're one of the smartest guys I know.
[02:53:16.770 --> 02:53:18.069]  So just lay it all out.
[02:53:18.149 --> 02:53:20.129]  We'll get into some of the campaign, but also back of the shots.
[02:53:20.469 --> 02:53:22.229]  You said you could stay an hour and a half, maybe longer.
[02:53:22.309 --> 02:53:22.590]  You got to go.
[02:53:22.709 --> 02:53:23.969]  I've got nowhere to go, man.
[02:53:24.149 --> 02:53:24.690]  Let's do this.
[02:53:24.850 --> 02:53:26.069]  Let's do the whole next hour.
[02:53:26.209 --> 02:53:26.569]  All right.
[02:53:26.889 --> 02:53:28.590]  Dale Bigtree is in fuego!
[02:53:30.100 --> 02:53:31.459]  All right, and support us, folks.

[02:53:56.840 --> 02:53:58.799]  It would take me a long time to go through the ingredients.
[02:53:59.579 --> 02:54:02.239]  There's three pages of them here and what they do.
[02:54:02.420 --> 02:54:17.430]  But it's got super high quality vitamin C, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, It's got panthenogenic acid, vitamin B5, so key, calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, chloride,

[02:55:35.909 --> 02:55:37.989]  This baby is next level.
[02:55:38.229 --> 02:55:43.969]  This is beyond anything out there at anywhere near this low price.
[02:55:44.590 --> 02:55:55.030]  As you know, I always seek to bring you the very best supplements possible so you get a great response, great effects, and you want to come back and get them again.
[02:55:55.209 --> 02:55:57.530]  Like a restaurant wants to have tasty, good, delicious food.
[02:55:57.629 --> 02:55:58.969]  So there's a line out the door.
[02:55:59.329 --> 02:56:07.469]  Well, I've got to admit some false advertising, and next time we reproduce this, or my sponsors do, we're going to probably have to change the name.
[02:56:07.809 --> 02:56:09.049]  And why is that?
[02:56:09.170 --> 02:56:09.750]  Well, it's simple.
[02:56:09.850 --> 02:56:13.729]  This is called Ultimate HydroForce Electrolyte Drink Mix.
[02:56:14.360 --> 02:56:17.959]  But it's really a superfood, post-workout, pre-workout.
[02:56:18.100 --> 02:56:21.799]  That's why it's Ultimate HydroForce and more, I guess you'd say.
[02:56:22.799 --> 02:56:28.399]  Hydration, energy, vitamins, minerals, health, immune system.
[02:56:28.760 --> 02:56:31.760]  Get your HydroForce exclusively at TheAlexYoungStore.com.
[02:56:43.030 --> 02:56:47.489]  By now, most Americans are aware that big media is corrupt and dishonest.
[02:56:48.090 --> 02:56:55.489]  Like magicians, they use the art of redirection to lure your attention, then deceive you.
[02:56:57.290 --> 02:57:01.969]  As a case study, let's replay this infamous clip from 2017.
[02:57:02.370 --> 02:57:07.989]  But you also had people that were Very fine people on both sides.
[02:57:08.209 --> 02:57:15.250]  To this day, Democrats insist that former President Trump has failed to disavow the racist elements within that crowd.
[02:57:15.549 --> 02:57:18.709]  And what did the president then at the time say?
[02:57:19.090 --> 02:57:21.170]  There were fine people on each side.
[02:57:21.350 --> 02:57:23.870]  There were very fine people on both sides.
[02:57:24.149 --> 02:57:25.190]  My God.
[02:57:25.969 --> 02:57:26.870]  That's what he said.
[02:57:28.489 --> 02:57:32.090]  Would it shock you to learn that exactly 50 seconds after Mr.
[02:57:32.250 --> 02:57:33.569]  Trump made that initial comment?
[02:57:33.709 --> 02:57:35.729]  Very fine people on both sides.
[02:57:35.930 --> 02:57:36.870]  He then said this.
[02:57:38.969 --> 02:57:44.649]  And I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists because they should be condemned totally.
[02:57:44.870 --> 02:57:54.049]  The fact-checking sites finally debunking Democrats' claims that then-President Trump called neo-Nazis and white nationalists, quote, very fine people.
[02:57:54.469 --> 02:57:58.110]  Ask yourself, how did they hide this for seven years?
[02:57:59.149 --> 02:58:02.709]  Then ask yourself, what else are they hiding?
[02:58:03.389 --> 02:58:06.030]  That Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler.
[02:58:06.209 --> 02:58:10.010]  Described American fallen soldiers as suckers and losers.
[02:58:10.270 --> 02:58:13.149]  He's determined to convince you there is a crisis at the border.
[02:58:13.290 --> 02:58:17.129]  Quote, it doesn't cost 60,000 bucks to bury an effing Mexican.
[02:58:17.329 --> 02:58:20.090]  Warning of a, quote, bloodbath if he loses the election.
[02:58:20.250 --> 02:58:22.329]  Admitting that he will, in fact, be a dictator.
[02:58:22.530 --> 02:58:24.309]  Called for the suspension of the Constitution.
[02:58:24.629 --> 02:58:26.969]  And is a sexist and a sexual harasser.
[02:58:27.229 --> 02:58:28.129]  They're playing the public.
[02:58:28.430 --> 02:58:28.950]  You.
[02:58:30.430 --> 02:58:38.129]  If we are ever going to heal as a nation, we must demand integrity from those entrusted as the broadcasters of critical information.
[02:58:40.049 --> 02:58:45.229]  Together we will pull back the curtain to expose and hold accountable every network of deception.
[02:58:45.389 --> 02:58:50.290]  Without truth, there is no trust.
[02:58:50.889 --> 02:58:52.969]  Without trust, there is no unity.
[02:58:53.610 --> 02:58:57.069]  Without unity, there is no United States.
[02:58:58.860 --> 02:59:04.520]  Paid for by Maha Alliance and not authorized by any candidate or candidates committee.
[02:59:05.760 --> 02:59:35.370]  Oh Lord my God How great Thou Maha Alliance is responsible for the content of this advertising.
[02:59:41.120 --> 02:59:48.399]  Soon after I was nearly assassinated in Pennsylvania last month, Bobby called me to express his best wishes.
[02:59:48.840 --> 02:59:53.360]  In honor of Bobby, I will establish a new commission on assassination.
[02:59:53.360 --> 03:00:01.659]  And they will be tasked with releasing all of the documents pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
[03:00:24.770 --> 03:00:30.530]  We're going to make America healthy again.
[03:00:31.129 --> 03:00:34.969]  Maha Alliance is responsible for the content of this advertising.
[03:00:41.129 --> 03:00:45.090]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[03:00:49.569 --> 03:00:53.889]  Alex Jones, a far-right conspiracy theorist who was apparently...
[03:01:00.290 --> 03:01:01.489]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:01:04.569 --> 03:01:05.110]  Scum!
[03:01:05.629 --> 03:01:07.090]  Russian scum!
[03:01:10.209 --> 03:01:11.629]  Until wars comes to mind.
[03:01:15.350 --> 03:01:17.030]  Your reputation is amazing.
[03:01:17.290 --> 03:01:18.850]  I will not let you down.
[03:01:19.069 --> 03:01:21.969]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:01:27.639 --> 03:01:31.799]  Dale Bigtree of the High Wire is live in the fourth hour now.
[03:01:32.360 --> 03:01:36.340]  350 plus radio stations and some cable and TV stations don't carry the first five minutes.
[03:01:36.420 --> 03:01:39.540]  So I heard some of those amazing ads that you guys have produced, the Maha Alliance.
[03:01:40.600 --> 03:01:43.459]  But I want to get to more of those in this hour with you and cover things.
[03:01:43.559 --> 03:01:46.959]  But we were talking during the break, Dale, and there's some people need to know about how real Trump is.
[03:01:47.360 --> 03:01:48.959]  Behind the scenes, he's admitted this.
[03:01:49.949 --> 03:01:51.389]  His family's a better desk.
[03:01:51.510 --> 03:01:52.069]  You've talked to him.
[03:01:52.129 --> 03:01:52.770]  I've talked to him.
[03:01:52.930 --> 03:01:54.430]  We were sharing these stories.
[03:01:54.770 --> 03:02:03.590]  It was Jared Kushner and Trump's daughter that were basically double agents and working with Google and the establishment, and they were scared.
[03:02:03.729 --> 03:02:05.329]  They're kind of Stockholm Syndrome people.
[03:02:06.069 --> 03:02:11.569]  When they stole the election from Trump four years ago and those two didn't back him, they weren't sidelined.
[03:02:11.829 --> 03:02:14.510]  They are nowhere to be seen and are not in the doghouse.
[03:02:14.590 --> 03:02:17.370]  They've been put on Mars on a rocket ship with Elon.
[03:02:17.670 --> 03:02:18.909]  You sent them off to Mars.
[03:02:19.069 --> 03:02:21.209]  So that's a good first sign.
[03:02:21.309 --> 03:02:22.229]  You want to elaborate on that?
[03:02:22.610 --> 03:02:23.690]  Well, I mean, I don't know.
[03:02:23.809 --> 03:02:28.750]  I mean, I know they're his family, and so I'm sure, as all things, I think they meant well from their perspective.
[03:02:28.930 --> 03:02:30.069]  I don't know how deep that goes.
[03:02:30.149 --> 03:02:45.659]  But I do know one of the people that I've had an opportunity to meet, that Robert Kennedy Jr., when he first came from the first meeting with Donald Trump right after the assassination attempt, In Butler, Bobby came out of that meeting and said, you know, this Don Jr.
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:47.719]  guy, I've had the wrong opinion about him.
[03:02:47.719 --> 03:02:53.540]  He's really actually a neat guy, has done a lot of beautiful things in his life, is a conservationist.
[03:02:53.620 --> 03:02:59.510]  We had a lot of great conversations about not necessarily environmentalism, but we all want to be able to eat the We want fish coming out of the river.
[03:02:59.629 --> 03:03:00.610]  We want clean air.
[03:03:00.790 --> 03:03:02.909]  We want a clean food supply for our family.
[03:03:03.110 --> 03:03:04.049]  And Don Jr.
[03:03:04.270 --> 03:03:07.610]  seems to be, you know, he was very quiet in the first presidency.
[03:03:07.809 --> 03:03:10.709]  It appears that he's really gonna be a part of this now.
[03:03:10.889 --> 03:03:12.930]  He's deeply a part of this transition team.
[03:03:13.809 --> 03:03:15.090]  He got Vance in there.
[03:03:15.209 --> 03:03:16.409]  He got Vance in there.
[03:03:16.530 --> 03:03:21.709]  I just think when you look at, as you said, you've got to look at who someone's surrounding themselves with.
[03:03:21.809 --> 03:03:25.270]  And we're just seeing a very different President Trump right now.
[03:03:25.430 --> 03:03:30.430]  Also, I think you have to look at the fact that President Trump doesn't need to get re-elected.
[03:03:30.530 --> 03:03:32.149]  He's got four more years and that's it.
[03:03:32.370 --> 03:03:33.329]  And they tried to kill him twice.
[03:03:33.360 --> 03:03:35.239]  They've already tried to kill him twice.
[03:03:36.139 --> 03:03:38.100]  So here's what we do know.
[03:03:38.500 --> 03:03:41.020]  Threatening his life does not back this guy away.
[03:03:41.159 --> 03:03:42.899]  I mean, you've got to hand it to him.
[03:03:43.059 --> 03:03:45.899]  He is walking boldly onto every stage.
[03:03:46.100 --> 03:03:47.600]  Nothing seems to be bothering him.
[03:03:47.879 --> 03:03:48.780]  That's incredible.
[03:03:49.079 --> 03:03:50.659]  Oh, I said he should retract some.
[03:03:50.659 --> 03:03:51.200]  He hasn't.
[03:03:51.389 --> 03:03:52.329]  No, he hasn't.
[03:03:52.489 --> 03:04:03.569]  I mean, he is, I think, you remember the scene in Pulp Fiction where the guy, like, fires his bullet a bunch of times as Samuel Jackson, and suddenly he just feels like he's somehow endowed by God that nothing can kill him.
[03:04:03.729 --> 03:04:05.170]  I kind of think that that's where Donald Trump is right now.
[03:04:05.170 --> 03:04:06.430]  Trump said that's what happened, basically.
[03:04:06.629 --> 03:04:06.729]  Right?
[03:04:06.790 --> 03:04:08.190]  He's like, I don't think they can kill me.
[03:04:08.250 --> 03:04:08.790]  They keep trying.
[03:04:08.790 --> 03:04:09.670]  It's not going to happen.
[03:04:09.790 --> 03:04:10.270]  He's competent.
[03:04:10.649 --> 03:04:19.250]  But look, I think what you're watching now, And one of the things I just want to say behind the scenes, when Robert Kennedy Jr.
[03:04:19.409 --> 03:04:23.510]  started having conversations with President Trump, it wasn't just the two of them.
[03:04:23.670 --> 03:04:24.989]  As he said, Don Jr.
[03:04:25.149 --> 03:04:25.370]  was there.
[03:04:25.530 --> 03:04:28.569]  But Elon Musk wanted to see this happen.
[03:04:28.790 --> 03:04:31.549]  You had Tulsi Gabbard in the conversation.
[03:04:31.649 --> 03:04:33.969]  You had Tucker Carlson.
[03:04:34.170 --> 03:04:38.030]  And even Joe Rogan behind the scenes was having some comments about.
[03:04:38.129 --> 03:04:39.209]  And part of it was...
[03:04:39.530 --> 03:04:57.290]  We're good to go.
[03:05:00.049 --> 03:05:02.909]  Does he really have the in-depth insight that Robert Kennedy Jr.
[03:05:03.110 --> 03:05:03.229]  does?
[03:05:03.370 --> 03:05:07.469]  So it was really a lot of powerful people that brought these two together.
[03:05:07.649 --> 03:05:13.809]  Callie and Casey Means, right after that brilliant interview they did with Tucker Carlson, were reaching out.
[03:05:14.129 --> 03:05:17.829]  And so unlike, I think a lot of people remember, Robert Kennedy Jr.
[03:05:18.069 --> 03:05:23.209]  was offered to run a vaccine safety commission by Donald Trump in the first election.
[03:05:23.350 --> 03:05:25.409]  But then he went out in front of the CNN cameras.
[03:05:25.719 --> 03:05:28.440]  And said, hey, I've been asked to run the Vaccine Safety Commission.
[03:05:28.700 --> 03:05:31.760]  And then that got reneged like three or four hours later.
[03:05:32.319 --> 03:05:33.700]  Bill Gates swooped in.
[03:05:33.899 --> 03:05:37.219]  Swooped in, scared Trump and who knows who else.
[03:05:37.559 --> 03:05:39.159]  And suddenly, oh, no, Robert Kennedy Jr.
[03:05:39.299 --> 03:05:39.879]  was mistaken.
[03:05:40.479 --> 03:05:42.639]  That's actually where I got involved with Robert Kennedy.
[03:05:42.780 --> 03:05:44.979]  Like, you know, the inside baseball on that.
[03:05:45.299 --> 03:05:46.600]  I had vaxxed.
[03:05:46.639 --> 03:05:47.899]  We were starting to tour the country.
[03:05:48.280 --> 03:05:50.079]  And we were out there.
[03:05:50.200 --> 03:05:51.879]  We were, you know, making a lot of progress.
[03:05:52.229 --> 03:05:53.469]  But Robert Kennedy Jr.
[03:05:53.690 --> 03:06:00.629]  had this giant phone call with a lot of people that were in the space saying, you know, he just basically called me a liar on television.
[03:06:00.629 --> 03:06:01.930]  I'm not very happy about it.
[03:06:01.989 --> 03:06:02.489]  I'm a Kennedy.
[03:06:02.709 --> 03:06:06.649]  I'm not supposed to allow someone to talk about us that way, as though somehow I misunderstood.
[03:06:07.069 --> 03:06:10.250]  But I was in that think tank and just kept giving my thoughts.
[03:06:10.250 --> 03:06:11.250]  And I was saying, you know...
[03:06:11.469 --> 03:06:16.709]  Bobby, Donald Trump's the only president that has ever said he believes that vaccines cause autism.
[03:06:16.889 --> 03:06:21.110]  He's the only one that's really looked at vaccines and saying something needs to change.
[03:06:21.250 --> 03:06:22.969]  Maybe we're giving too many too often.
[03:06:23.209 --> 03:06:24.610]  Maybe there's studies we can do.
[03:06:24.770 --> 03:06:27.889]  Maybe we can test people before they get the vaccines to see if there's susceptibilities.
[03:06:28.290 --> 03:06:29.829]  He had those thoughts.
[03:06:29.969 --> 03:06:32.010]  They said, we don't want to burn that bridge.
[03:06:32.329 --> 03:06:34.809]  And looking back now, I'm really glad that we didn't.
[03:06:34.930 --> 03:06:40.350]  Looking back now, I don't think Donald Trump really fully knew how corrupt the whole space was.
[03:06:40.469 --> 03:06:41.069]  He said that.
[03:06:41.209 --> 03:06:42.430]  Trump said he didn't know how bad it was.
[03:06:42.670 --> 03:06:43.290]  He did not know.
[03:06:43.489 --> 03:06:48.950]  And now, not just the words, but the actions and the leaks, the establishment is apoplectic.
[03:06:49.110 --> 03:06:52.170]  I mean, they are so scared of this brain trust coming in.
[03:06:52.549 --> 03:06:54.049]  And it's not going to be a matter of roses.
[03:06:54.049 --> 03:06:54.969]  Nothing's going to be perfect.
[03:06:55.190 --> 03:06:56.649]  But this is exciting.
[03:06:56.850 --> 03:06:57.870]  It's very exciting.
[03:06:58.149 --> 03:07:08.379]  And really, you know, one of the things I want to say is this, that We're good to go.
[03:07:24.299 --> 03:07:29.659]  Well, all we wanted from the beginning is just to have vaccinated versus an unvaccinated study.
[03:07:29.940 --> 03:07:36.420]  Take all of the vaccinated people in that database and then, you know, compare them to all the unvaccinated and ask, who has more cancer?
[03:07:36.620 --> 03:07:37.780]  Who has more diabetes?
[03:07:38.139 --> 03:07:39.520]  Who has more, you know...
[03:07:39.520 --> 03:07:41.000]  Similar to the leak we got out of New Zealand.
[03:07:41.260 --> 03:07:42.219]  Right, exactly.
[03:07:42.559 --> 03:07:57.299]  So one of the things that's going to happen right away, and think about this, Alex, even if you weren't able to change a single scientist or doctor or corrupt person in there, which I know is going to happen, one thing that will happen immediately is all those databases are going to be made public.
[03:07:58.049 --> 03:08:00.069]  We fought and made the Pfizer data public.
[03:08:00.530 --> 03:08:05.450]  Naomi Wolf is now able to do the work and scientists are looking at it because they've got the data and they start crunching the numbers.
[03:08:05.629 --> 03:08:08.090]  We've got AI. We've got Elon Musk.
[03:08:08.190 --> 03:08:09.149]  We've got computer learning.
[03:08:09.290 --> 03:08:10.250]  We're the home of Apple.
[03:08:10.370 --> 03:08:11.209]  We're the home of Microsoft.
[03:08:11.450 --> 03:08:12.870]  We're the home of Google.
[03:08:13.090 --> 03:08:31.149]  So what happens when suddenly all the data that's been hidden on what the heck is happening to us, whether it's the color in our fruit loops that is illegal in other countries, but we're eating it here, We're going to have answers to what's doing that to our health simply because those databases are going to be made public the way they should have always been.
[03:08:31.329 --> 03:08:36.010]  We're talking about this one thing you know Donald Trump's going to do because it's at no risk whatsoever.
[03:08:36.149 --> 03:08:41.190]  What Robert Kennedy Jr., they're going to take these databases and say no longer is this hidden from the public.
[03:08:41.329 --> 03:08:43.110]  This is going to be a transparent government.
[03:08:43.229 --> 03:08:47.389]  This is a government for and by the people and let the people look at this data.
[03:08:47.559 --> 03:09:05.020]  Let the scientists around the world crunch these numbers and tell us what's poisoning us, what's killing us, because you know we have gone from 12% chronic illness in the 1980s to now 60% of our population have a chronic illness, either a neurological disorder or an autoimmune disease.
[03:09:05.260 --> 03:09:07.239]  We are the sickest nation in the world.
[03:09:07.420 --> 03:09:07.860]  Fact.
[03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:09.659]  We have the sickest children in the world.
[03:09:09.860 --> 03:09:10.340]  Fact.
[03:09:10.459 --> 03:09:13.719]  We have the sickest generation of children we've ever seen in this country.
[03:09:14.020 --> 03:09:14.500]  Fact.
[03:09:14.829 --> 03:09:16.870]  We are doing something wrong.
[03:09:17.049 --> 03:09:19.370]  And you've got people saying, well, Del, how do you know it's vaccines?
[03:09:19.549 --> 03:09:22.709]  How do you know it's not the colors and the dyes in our fruit loop?
[03:09:22.770 --> 03:09:23.270]  It's all of it.
[03:09:23.370 --> 03:09:28.510]  How do you know it's not the hormones in our beef or the glyphosate sprayed over all of our vegetables?
[03:09:28.729 --> 03:09:33.229]  And I say, you know, no matter what it is, it's the same regulatory agencies that are passing it.
[03:09:33.530 --> 03:09:38.290]  Whatever it is, it's the fault of the CDC, the FDA, NIH, Healthy Immune Services.
[03:09:38.510 --> 03:09:45.569]  You're sick because they said something was safe that should never been allowed into your body, into your air, into your food, into your water.
[03:09:45.709 --> 03:09:50.329]  And finally, we have people going into government that know exactly how to do this.
[03:09:50.500 --> 03:09:52.020]  They know exactly who to get rid of.
[03:09:52.079 --> 03:09:52.739]  Robert Kenney Jr.
[03:09:52.920 --> 03:09:54.299]  is not just a guy with an opinion.
[03:09:54.440 --> 03:09:58.479]  He's been someone that's been winning lawsuits against these people his entire career.
[03:09:58.680 --> 03:10:04.739]  40 years he spent fighting for citizens, fighting corporations, getting, you know, cleaning up the Hudson River.
[03:10:04.840 --> 03:10:05.940]  You know how hard that was?
[03:10:06.079 --> 03:10:25.819]  To clean up the Hudson River was like a death We're good to go.
[03:10:29.129 --> 03:10:30.129]  You got the floor, buddy.
[03:10:30.250 --> 03:10:31.909]  I'm not interrupting you.
[03:10:31.969 --> 03:10:34.329]  I only interrupt guests when they're not saying anything.
[03:10:34.530 --> 03:10:36.950]  I cut you a clip when Robert Kennedy Jr.
[03:10:37.129 --> 03:10:37.850]  suspended his campaign.
[03:10:37.969 --> 03:10:38.590]  Why don't we play that?
[03:10:38.590 --> 03:10:39.129]  Yeah, let's play that.
[03:10:39.229 --> 03:10:40.969]  Let me see.
[03:10:41.170 --> 03:10:43.149]  That's RFK suspension clip five.
[03:10:43.270 --> 03:10:44.069]  Let's roll clip five.
[03:10:44.110 --> 03:10:44.530]  Here it is.
[03:10:47.069 --> 03:10:51.250]  I watched generations of children get sicker and sicker.
[03:10:51.250 --> 03:10:53.989]  I had 11 siblings and I had seven kids myself.
[03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:58.520]  I was conscious of what was happening in their classrooms and to their friends.
[03:10:58.719 --> 03:11:01.559]  And I watched these sick kids, these damaged kids.
[03:11:02.540 --> 03:11:05.680]  In that generation, almost all of them are damaged.
[03:11:06.379 --> 03:11:10.219]  And nobody in power seemed to care or to even notice.
[03:11:10.500 --> 03:11:13.860]  For 19 years, I prayed every morning.
[03:11:14.680 --> 03:11:19.379]  That God would put me in a position to end this calamity.
[03:11:19.860 --> 03:11:28.219]  The chronic disease crisis was one of the primary reasons for my running for president, along with ending censorship in the Ukraine war.
[03:11:28.700 --> 03:11:33.799]  It's the reason I've made the heart-wrenching decision to suspend my campaign.
[03:11:34.930 --> 03:11:36.930]  And to support President Trump.
[03:11:37.069 --> 03:11:45.829]  Ultimately, the future, however it happens, is in God's hands and in the hands of the American voters and those of President Trump.
[03:11:46.670 --> 03:11:56.530]  If President Trump is elected and honors his word, the vast burden of chronic disease that now demoralizes and bankrupts the country will disappear.
[03:11:57.530 --> 03:11:59.629]  This is a spiritual journey for me.
[03:12:00.729 --> 03:12:14.909]  I reached my decision through deep prayer, through hard-nosed logic, and I asked myself, what choices must I make to maximize my chances to save America's children and restore national health?
[03:12:15.450 --> 03:12:27.409]  I felt that if I refused this opportunity, I would not be able to look myself in the mirror, knowing that I could have saved lives of countless children and reversed this country's chronic disease epidemic.
[03:12:28.840 --> 03:12:30.159]  I'm 70 years old.
[03:12:30.379 --> 03:12:33.479]  I may have a decade to be effective.
[03:12:34.219 --> 03:12:43.500]  I can't imagine that a President Harris would allow me or anyone to solve these dire problems.
[03:12:43.700 --> 03:12:50.809]  After eight years of President Harris, Any opportunity for me to fix the problem will be out of my reach forever.
[03:12:51.549 --> 03:12:55.190]  President Trump has told me that he wants this to be his legacy.
[03:12:56.049 --> 03:12:59.049]  I'm choosing to believe that this time he will follow through.
[03:12:59.510 --> 03:13:10.690]  Ultimately, the only thing that will save our country and our children is if we choose to love our kids more than we hate each other.
[03:13:11.500 --> 03:13:17.219]  The most unifying theme for all Americans is that we all love our children.
[03:13:17.739 --> 03:13:26.719]  If we all unite around that issue now, we can finally give them the protection, the health and the future that they deserve.
[03:13:27.180 --> 03:13:45.840]  You see, there's not just evil in the universe, and we're seeing the initiative of good turn the tide, and we are really seeing a corrupt, arrogant force that is at war with us, that is nihilistic, that is transhumanist, that is satanic, realize that they've got a real fight on their hands,
[03:13:46.079 --> 03:13:46.260]  Del.
[03:13:46.440 --> 03:13:46.819]  They do.
[03:13:47.360 --> 03:13:52.120]  It's the fight that has to be had, and it's really the last hour.
[03:13:52.829 --> 03:14:02.350]  I think, you know, one of the things that makes you so spectacular, Alex, is long before any of us were here, you were starting to talk about this deep state.
[03:14:02.530 --> 03:14:13.930]  You were talking about this, you know, a government that was supposed to be of, for, and by the people that was being robbed from us by corporate interests, by special interests, by globalists, long before anybody else ever did.
[03:14:14.459 --> 03:14:20.440]  And to imagine you sitting here in this moment, and I've been at this for about 10 years.
[03:14:20.559 --> 03:14:22.260]  I always, you know, I was aware of things.
[03:14:22.399 --> 03:14:25.280]  I grew up with parents that, you know, told me to question the authority too.
[03:14:25.459 --> 03:14:27.500]  But we are in that impactful moment.
[03:14:27.620 --> 03:14:29.799]  And in many ways, not enough people are listening to you.
[03:14:30.139 --> 03:14:45.319]  And I want to say that, you know, I think the vaccine, and we've talked about this before, that was the tip of the spear of the final death blow, which was if we can inject you and own your bodies and own the bodies of your children and pass laws that say that, you know, because of vaccinations,
[03:14:45.319 --> 03:14:47.360]  we've decided that we own your children.
[03:14:47.540 --> 03:14:48.379]  We make a decision.
[03:14:48.440 --> 03:14:49.739]  That's a revolutionary takeover.
[03:14:49.770 --> 03:14:51.350]  It was a revolutionary takeover.
[03:14:51.790 --> 03:14:54.010]  And so people like me got alarmed by that.
[03:14:54.170 --> 03:14:58.610]  And we joined forces with people like you that have been really talking about it for a long time.
[03:14:58.729 --> 03:15:01.670]  But I would say that we're at the very last stage.
[03:15:01.770 --> 03:15:06.750]  I was just speaking publicly and this woman said, if things don't happen that fast, you're being really dramatic.
[03:15:06.930 --> 03:15:09.110]  I don't think this election matters that much.
[03:15:09.270 --> 03:15:13.670]  I was like, that's because you're looking at this over the last year or maybe two years.
[03:15:13.829 --> 03:15:17.649]  There's people like Bobby that's been fighting the corporate establishment for 40 years.
[03:15:18.030 --> 03:15:27.110]  As a lawyer that watched his father when he was 13 years old be killed for exactly this battle and his uncle when he was 10 years old.
[03:15:27.530 --> 03:15:40.069]  So depending on what window you look at this, we're really at the end stage of a takeover and destruction of the one thing that stands in the way of globalist thinking, which is the Constitution of the United States of America.
[03:15:40.250 --> 03:15:49.340]  And whether you're looking at it because of the vaccine issue Or you're looking because of Federal Reserve banking issues, or you're looking at it for the war machine or whatever it is.
[03:15:49.520 --> 03:15:53.360]  When you get in a room with any of these people like me, I don't know a lot about those issues.
[03:15:53.500 --> 03:15:57.700]  But when we start talking, I can start finishing their sentences because it's the same game.
[03:15:57.700 --> 03:15:58.139]  Same enemy.
[03:15:58.430 --> 03:16:08.290]  Same enemy, same game, same way they keep putting the power players into your regulatory agencies, the power players into the CIA, people that do not care about American citizens.
[03:16:08.670 --> 03:16:20.250]  So when Robert Kennedy Jr., in that moment, which I think when people, you know, General Flynn called it one of the greatest political speeches of all times, and if people haven't seen it, they should go to Robert Kennedy Jr.'s website and watch that speech.
[03:16:20.450 --> 03:16:26.209]  It is the most impassioned, powerful statement about the state of America that I've ever seen.
[03:16:26.370 --> 03:16:27.389]  It brought tears to my eyes.
[03:16:27.530 --> 03:16:29.649]  It brought tears to my eyes, and I was standing in that room.
[03:16:29.750 --> 03:16:34.809]  And just to give a little inside baseball to people, you know, we had spent a month going back and forth.
[03:16:35.149 --> 03:16:41.270]  Bobby Kennedy had this amazing moment when Donald Trump, when that bullet clipped his ear, Bobby said to us, I gotta call him.
[03:16:41.290 --> 03:16:42.110]  I gotta call him right now.
[03:16:42.170 --> 03:16:43.370]  And he reached out to president.
[03:16:43.409 --> 03:16:44.709]  He's obviously thinking about his dad and uncle.
[03:16:44.889 --> 03:16:45.250]  Immediately.
[03:16:45.590 --> 03:16:46.530]  This is the finals.
[03:16:47.350 --> 03:16:49.549]  Seal that this guy's anti-establishment.
[03:16:49.809 --> 03:16:51.989]  All the corporate money going to Kamala.
[03:16:53.290 --> 03:16:55.170]  He's like, wait, this is my whole life.
[03:16:55.270 --> 03:16:56.190]  This is my destiny.
[03:16:56.350 --> 03:16:57.329]  This is my whole life.
[03:16:57.409 --> 03:16:58.489]  This is what I've been fighting.
[03:16:58.649 --> 03:17:00.389]  And this has just gone too far.
[03:17:00.530 --> 03:17:01.549]  It has gone too far.
[03:17:01.670 --> 03:17:02.989]  The rhetoric has gone too far.
[03:17:03.170 --> 03:17:08.959]  One of the things I loved about working with Bobby is he said to us from day one, I'm not going to run any attack ads.
[03:17:09.079 --> 03:17:11.260]  I'm not going to speak down about the people around me.
[03:17:11.340 --> 03:17:13.659]  We're going to stick with policy and talk about that.
[03:17:13.760 --> 03:17:20.639]  But he called Donald Trump at that moment, just hours after the bullet had clipped him and just nearly took his life.
[03:17:20.639 --> 03:17:22.399]  And he just said, look, we need to talk.
[03:17:23.720 --> 03:17:25.760]  I, you know, first of all, how are you doing?
[03:17:25.899 --> 03:17:27.639]  But more importantly, how's your family?
[03:17:27.760 --> 03:17:32.360]  I was the son, you know, of why I watched my father be assassinated.
[03:17:32.479 --> 03:17:33.959]  I watched my uncle be assassinated.
[03:17:34.180 --> 03:17:35.299]  There is trauma.
[03:17:35.299 --> 03:17:41.059]  And Bobby's realizing, I mean, he's realizing the same deep state that killed his dad and uncle.
[03:17:41.219 --> 03:17:44.299]  He's understanding this is his chance to actually bring them down.
[03:17:44.500 --> 03:17:44.719]  Right.
[03:17:44.840 --> 03:17:47.659]  Well, and I don't even think at that moment, I think really it was just about...
[03:17:48.760 --> 03:17:51.459]  President Trump, I respect you, and that should have never happened.
[03:17:51.620 --> 03:17:54.719]  But what happened in that conversation is President Trump said, I'm glad you called.
[03:17:54.840 --> 03:17:55.719]  Bobby, we need to talk.
[03:17:55.860 --> 03:18:00.920]  And these two guys really started talking about, let's talk about the things that we're both seeing the same.
[03:18:01.040 --> 03:18:02.520]  We are both being censored.
[03:18:02.959 --> 03:18:03.799]  Robert Kennedy Jr.
[03:18:04.040 --> 03:18:08.420]  has one of the most powerful cases against the Biden administration for censorship because of social media.
[03:18:08.600 --> 03:18:14.819]  The judge in the case that ruled in his favor said that this is one of the most egregious attacks on the First Amendment we've ever seen.
[03:18:15.049 --> 03:18:23.149]  But beyond that, we were not allowed on CBS, NBC, ABC. He wasn't allowed on the debate stage, even though he should have been there.
[03:18:23.250 --> 03:18:25.590]  And to Trump, I want to make sure that everyone knows this.
[03:18:25.889 --> 03:18:31.469]  One of the things that was amazing about Trump, when Joe Biden was said to CNN, I will not appear in that debate if Robert Kennedy Jr.
[03:18:31.829 --> 03:18:33.569]  shows up, you know what President Trump was saying?
[03:18:33.870 --> 03:18:35.229]  Publicly, he was saying...
[03:18:35.489 --> 03:18:36.510]  I think Robert Kennedy Jr.
[03:18:36.690 --> 03:18:37.590]  should be on that debate stage.
[03:18:37.790 --> 03:18:39.350]  Everyone should hear what this guy has to say.
[03:18:39.469 --> 03:18:39.889]  It's important.
[03:18:39.969 --> 03:18:40.969]  I think he's a good guy.
[03:18:41.129 --> 03:18:41.889]  He means well.
[03:18:42.049 --> 03:18:46.010]  And behind the scenes, he was saying to CNN, you should have Robert Kennedy Jr.
[03:18:46.129 --> 03:18:46.250]  in this.
[03:18:46.430 --> 03:18:59.590]  So anyone that says the dictator was President Biden, who didn't want to have any challenge whatsoever, but Donald Trump, even in that moment, and think about that, Bobby Kennedy was polling equally from Biden and from Trump.
[03:18:59.790 --> 03:19:01.350]  No one could figure out who he was hurting.
[03:19:01.350 --> 03:19:02.430]  But Trump was not a totality.
[03:19:02.930 --> 03:19:03.870]  That was it.
[03:19:03.969 --> 03:19:05.510]  He was like, look, it's freedom of speech.
[03:19:05.670 --> 03:19:06.510]  Get this guy in here.
[03:19:06.590 --> 03:19:07.309]  Let's have a debate.
[03:19:07.450 --> 03:19:09.010]  Let's put these ideas on the table.
[03:19:09.209 --> 03:19:12.930]  So when they're having that conversation, they realize you've been censored.
[03:19:13.069 --> 03:19:13.790]  I've been censored.
[03:19:13.870 --> 03:19:15.129]  They just tried to kill you.
[03:19:15.229 --> 03:19:17.489]  They've been character assassinating me.
[03:19:17.610 --> 03:19:19.909]  We were just starting to get on all 50 states.
[03:19:20.069 --> 03:19:21.780]  One of the most- They didn't give Bobby secret service.
[03:19:21.899 --> 03:19:22.600]  They didn't give Trump enough.
[03:19:22.760 --> 03:19:25.420]  They didn't give Bobby secret service until after that moment.
[03:19:25.639 --> 03:19:41.549]  And then, you know, when we finally got on the ballot, New York, we started getting lawsuits all across the country trying to kick off the ballot after hundreds of thousands of people have been through the snow and the rain doing what Americans do and getting people to sign their names and say, we want Robert- The message is,
[03:19:41.770 --> 03:19:45.010]  even though those battles were lost, we're now winning the war, never give up.
[03:20:05.549 --> 03:20:12.809]  And so after about four weeks of back and forth, I will say it wasn't easy for Robert Kennedy Jr., you know, a Kennedy Democrat.
[03:20:12.809 --> 03:20:14.510]  He left the party, went independent.
[03:20:14.690 --> 03:20:17.030]  But in that moment, we finally, we had a meeting.
[03:20:17.129 --> 03:20:18.370]  I got called to Hyannisport.
[03:20:18.450 --> 03:20:19.270]  We all sat down.
[03:20:19.409 --> 03:20:24.829]  Some of the great minds from all around the world, I pinched myself for being allowed and invited into that room.
[03:20:24.950 --> 03:20:26.770]  But everybody weighed in, Alex.
[03:20:27.279 --> 03:20:30.840]  Some of us, even me, I was like, I don't know if this is the right idea for you, Bobby.
[03:20:31.059 --> 03:20:32.579]  I have spiritual issues with it.
[03:20:32.620 --> 03:20:33.719]  We all weighed in.
[03:20:33.860 --> 03:20:37.520]  And just like Trump is right now, Bobby heard from all of us.
[03:20:37.579 --> 03:20:38.860]  He heard from every perspective.
[03:20:38.979 --> 03:20:40.659]  And then we all just thought about it.
[03:20:40.659 --> 03:20:43.120]  And what it came down to is what he said in that speech.
[03:20:43.620 --> 03:20:46.159]  Is in the end, am I gonna win this as an independent?
[03:20:46.420 --> 03:20:46.579]  No.
[03:20:46.799 --> 03:20:48.020]  This thing is rigged against me.
[03:20:48.079 --> 03:20:49.120]  There's no way whatsoever.
[03:20:49.379 --> 03:20:53.620]  So I can be a martyr, which what good does that do in the face of what we're looking at?
[03:20:53.940 --> 03:20:57.680]  Or President Trump is offering me the opportunity to help build a cabinet.
[03:20:57.860 --> 03:21:04.780]  And what he said and was leaked in that video, which is really unfortunate, You know, President Trump did say, our kids are being poisoned, Bobby.
[03:21:05.139 --> 03:21:06.340]  You've been on this forever.
[03:21:06.479 --> 03:21:07.319]  This is your focus.
[03:21:07.620 --> 03:21:09.860]  What if I gave you the ability to focus on that?
[03:21:09.979 --> 03:21:10.979]  Go in and clean this up.
[03:21:11.280 --> 03:21:12.959]  Figure out how to make our children healthier.
[03:21:13.180 --> 03:21:14.979]  Figure out how to make this nation healthier.
[03:21:15.379 --> 03:21:16.479]  You know, I believe in you.
[03:21:16.579 --> 03:21:19.100]  I've always respected you, and I'm really tired of fighting you.
[03:21:19.219 --> 03:21:32.299]  And even if Kennedy would have gotten in the first time, You can say maybe he would have stopped the whole COVID thing, but regardless, now that they did that, it's blown up their face bigger, and now the climate's perfect for him to come in and turn the tide on the whole big pharma poison system.
[03:21:32.360 --> 03:21:33.680]  And now you have the people behind you.
[03:21:33.780 --> 03:21:35.120]  I don't know if you would have in the first time.
[03:21:35.219 --> 03:21:37.020]  Like, you know, God works in mysterious ways.
[03:21:37.059 --> 03:21:38.719]  I was about to say, God works in mysterious ways.
[03:21:38.879 --> 03:21:40.860]  I mean, in the end, it's happening now for a reason.
[03:21:40.860 --> 03:21:41.760]  And we're simpatico.
[03:21:41.840 --> 03:21:43.280]  I was about to say, God works in mysterious ways.
[03:21:43.559 --> 03:21:43.959]  That's it.
[03:21:43.979 --> 03:21:45.180]  You can see God's hand in this.
[03:21:45.440 --> 03:21:46.340]  You can feel it.
[03:21:46.459 --> 03:21:47.680]  And I mean, that's what's...
[03:21:47.680 --> 03:21:49.799]  But you're saying all this, it's all true.
[03:21:49.879 --> 03:21:50.520]  It makes me understand.
[03:21:51.350 --> 03:21:53.049]  We can't underestimate the bad guys.
[03:21:53.049 --> 03:21:54.049]  They're trying to steal it.
[03:21:54.090 --> 03:21:55.010]  They're catching them everywhere.
[03:21:55.350 --> 03:21:57.209]  A lot of rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[03:21:57.389 --> 03:22:00.850]  All these other pundits like Cuomo are now saying nice things about Trump.
[03:22:03.090 --> 03:22:05.090]  Let's look at the dark side here.
[03:22:05.889 --> 03:22:07.370]  What could the bad guys do?
[03:22:08.770 --> 03:22:17.250]  I mean, I always think that, you know, in the Bible it says, you know, the sons of darkness will be smarter in their time or something like that than the sons of light.
[03:22:17.950 --> 03:22:20.569]  I don't know what time we're in, but I will say this.
[03:22:20.790 --> 03:22:22.909]  I feel pretty good about the ads that we're putting out.
[03:22:23.010 --> 03:22:26.530]  I was about to say, I don't know if evil's been having its time.
[03:22:26.530 --> 03:22:27.750]  I feel like it's had its time.
[03:22:28.059 --> 03:22:30.440]  I feel like it's had its time, and I think people are seeing it.
[03:22:30.520 --> 03:22:31.600]  You know what evil can't do?
[03:22:31.659 --> 03:22:33.620]  It's not moving hearts and minds anymore.
[03:22:33.700 --> 03:22:35.739]  It is so run on fear.
[03:22:35.959 --> 03:22:42.459]  I mean, you watch this insanity of what they just said about this brilliant Madison Square Garden.
[03:22:42.620 --> 03:22:47.479]  The fact that they're going with a Hillary Clinton playbook, calling more than half of Americans.
[03:22:47.479 --> 03:22:49.579]  85 years ago, Nazis were there.
[03:22:50.079 --> 03:22:50.760]  What the hell is that?
[03:22:50.760 --> 03:22:51.059]  I mean, it's outrageous.
[03:22:51.379 --> 03:22:52.579]  I mean, this is how bad this...
[03:22:52.579 --> 03:22:54.399]  This is how bad a state they're in.
[03:22:54.620 --> 03:23:01.860]  A woman who couldn't win on basket of deplorables now appears to be in charge of the entire common campaign saying, no, we just weren't hard enough.
[03:23:02.040 --> 03:23:04.200]  Call them all a bunch of Nazis and that'll work.
[03:23:04.319 --> 03:23:05.319]  It doesn't matter that there's a...
[03:23:05.739 --> 03:23:12.360]  You know, an entire side of this building filled with Hasidic Jewish people and Israel, you know, flags flying everywhere.
[03:23:12.600 --> 03:23:14.059]  No one will pay attention to that.
[03:23:14.200 --> 03:23:16.780]  It's all backfiring because they're so desperate.
[03:23:16.780 --> 03:23:19.440]  Because in the end, they don't have God.
[03:23:19.600 --> 03:23:20.000]  And what does that mean?
[03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:23.219]  No, I agree with you, but because they're so desperate, that's what makes them so...
[03:23:23.219 --> 03:23:23.739]  They'll do anything.
[03:23:24.139 --> 03:23:25.559]  There's no doubt about it.
[03:23:25.600 --> 03:23:26.440]  And this is what I said.
[03:23:26.920 --> 03:23:27.639]  I don't know.
[03:23:27.760 --> 03:23:28.879]  I haven't done enough investigation.
[03:23:28.879 --> 03:23:32.280]  I've never been able to prove whether or not the last election was stolen.
[03:23:32.280 --> 03:23:34.879]  I have serious questions about it, but I will say this.
[03:23:34.979 --> 03:23:41.239]  As the director of communications for Robert Kennedy Jr., he was cheated the entire time in the Democratic Party.
[03:23:41.420 --> 03:23:44.979]  They actually passed a rule because we were doing really well in New Hampshire.
[03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:46.879]  It's usually the first primary state.
[03:23:47.239 --> 03:23:55.979]  The Democratic Party passed a rule that if you had gone in and campaigned in New Hampshire, in the primary, all of your votes would automatically go to Joe Biden.
[03:23:56.260 --> 03:23:58.180]  And they just removed Biden.
[03:23:58.280 --> 03:24:04.100]  Let's finish that and then get into more of these ads and just talk about, man, Dale, you're always doing a great job.
[03:24:04.200 --> 03:24:05.180]  This is amazing.
[03:24:05.180 --> 03:24:07.479]  This interview, we're going to put it all out later.
[03:24:07.600 --> 03:24:09.379]  It's live right now, but we got to cut this up.
[03:24:09.739 --> 03:24:10.100]  Wow.

[03:25:10.569 --> 03:25:13.469]  Well, the one, the only Dale Bigtrees here, and I want to say something.
[03:25:14.250 --> 03:25:15.750]  It's a liberal...
[03:25:18.390 --> 03:25:27.590]  I've been on there 30 plus years, 30 years and a half, but within about 27 years ago, they'd have articles in the local paper saying, boy, is Alex Jones on cocaine.
[03:25:27.770 --> 03:25:28.870]  Let's be 100% clear.
[03:25:28.989 --> 03:25:32.389]  My only problems have been with depressants, alcohol, and I haven't been drinking a long time.
[03:25:32.870 --> 03:25:34.770]  But the point is, people say, why are you so excited?
[03:25:35.010 --> 03:25:50.329]  How are you not excited when I was reading globalist books published by them, The Club of Rome, Limits to Growth, we're going to have world government, we're going to demonize the family, we're going to put chemicals in the food and water to lower their fertility, we're going to put compounds in the shots to sterilize people, the UN got caught in the 90s doing it,
[03:25:50.709 --> 03:25:54.549]  adding hormones attached to the shots, there's a trillion, it just goes on and on.
[03:25:55.520 --> 03:25:58.200]  And how do you not get excited about a tyrannical group?
[03:25:58.200 --> 03:26:02.479]  Bill Gates, 15 years ago, you know, at a TED Talk saying we're going to depopulate the earth.
[03:26:02.639 --> 03:26:05.079]  The real name of his foundation is the Global Population Control Fund.
[03:26:05.219 --> 03:26:06.500]  They have award ceremonies.
[03:26:06.979 --> 03:26:09.700]  I mean, I would get excited if I saw my neighbor being mugged.
[03:26:09.879 --> 03:26:14.860]  If I could be totally calm in my bathrobe and I see my neighbor being mugged, I'm going to grab a gun and go, you know, you know what?
[03:26:15.209 --> 03:26:16.870]  I mean, that's what men act like.
[03:26:17.309 --> 03:26:19.090]  And, you know, Del Bigtree's obviously in great shape.
[03:26:19.209 --> 03:26:21.350]  He's not on cocaine and privately super calm.
[03:26:21.549 --> 03:26:25.670]  Once he gets on air, he's reporting to you giant crimes being committed.
[03:26:26.469 --> 03:26:31.969]  Nuremberg, you know, 10.0, the crimes are, as Naomi Wolf has said, studying history, the biggest crimes ever.
[03:26:32.610 --> 03:26:34.770]  And you're supposed to get excited.
[03:26:34.790 --> 03:26:40.110]  If you go to a sports game and you yell and scream about your team and pay yourself up and go crazy, that's a good American.
[03:26:40.270 --> 03:26:46.250]  But if you raise your voice and get upset about total tyranny and now starting to win against it, that's weird.
[03:26:46.389 --> 03:26:49.510]  No, we need to make it normal to get excited like Dale Bigtrick.
[03:26:49.530 --> 03:26:52.329]  He's one of the only other, and he's a great TV producer, researcher, you name it.
[03:26:52.590 --> 03:27:01.110]  Here he is for over an hour and a half, super excited, even more than me, because he has been fighting and he sees the tide being turned, and that is exciting.
[03:27:01.149 --> 03:27:04.870]  So you said earlier, You're talking about what must it be like to be Alex Jones.
[03:27:05.049 --> 03:27:08.930]  I was thinking that, just like I thought the Lord works mysterious ways you said that.
[03:27:08.989 --> 03:27:15.889]  I was about to say, literally, coming into the break, but you jumped in, which is great, like we're telepathing here or something.
[03:27:16.170 --> 03:27:19.649]  You literally said, I can't imagine what it's like to be here this long and to see it.
[03:27:19.729 --> 03:27:24.229]  And I wanted to say, I don't think you're right about this is coming to a head now.
[03:27:24.370 --> 03:27:25.209]  I know it.
[03:27:25.379 --> 03:27:27.040]  I mean, baby, I'm getting chills.
[03:27:27.280 --> 03:27:31.540]  This is game time for the whole future of the frickin' species.
[03:27:31.840 --> 03:27:37.079]  And you study the history books and you study philosophers, good wakes up in the final quarter, folks.
[03:27:37.200 --> 03:27:38.239]  And again, it's happening.
[03:27:38.420 --> 03:27:39.200]  I mean, woo!
[03:27:39.440 --> 03:27:40.700]  Being alive right now, brother!
[03:27:40.840 --> 03:27:41.120]  It's good.
[03:27:41.139 --> 03:27:43.239]  Thank you for everything you and your crew have done.
[03:27:43.420 --> 03:27:46.739]  You guys are literally the Michael Jordans of the damn fight.
[03:27:47.120 --> 03:27:50.219]  It's not about credit, but it's about betting on the horse that wins.
[03:27:50.360 --> 03:27:51.879]  You guys got the triple crown.
[03:27:52.180 --> 03:27:55.920]  Your whole crew, RFK Jr., all of you, I salute you.
[03:27:56.059 --> 03:27:57.139]  I appreciate it, Alex.
[03:27:57.299 --> 03:27:57.639]  Boom!
[03:27:58.639 --> 03:28:01.719]  I really appreciate that, and I am very excited.
[03:28:01.879 --> 03:28:06.139]  We are on the five-yard line here in a spot that no one said we would ever be able to get to.
[03:28:06.280 --> 03:28:08.520]  They said the people are asleep, they'll never care.
[03:28:08.739 --> 03:28:11.440]  They own the television sets, Alex, and we did it without them.
[03:28:11.600 --> 03:28:14.040]  I mean, we are finding ourselves in a position for anyone.
[03:28:14.200 --> 03:28:15.940]  I know there's like Debbie Downers out there.
[03:28:16.040 --> 03:28:19.159]  Oh, they're going to steal the election anyway, or all that.
[03:28:19.399 --> 03:28:22.000]  Or, I don't know if I trust Donald Trump.
[03:28:22.120 --> 03:28:24.959]  But as you said, what would it look like?
[03:28:25.219 --> 03:28:26.100]  This is what I keep saying.
[03:28:26.260 --> 03:28:30.420]  What would the moment look like if you were about to take back your country?
[03:28:30.659 --> 03:28:35.040]  If the United States of America was really falling apart, you felt like it wasn't speaking for you.
[03:28:35.239 --> 03:28:38.600]  Everyone in America is polling saying that the television is lying to me.
[03:28:38.680 --> 03:28:39.899]  I don't trust my government.
[03:28:39.899 --> 03:28:41.440]  I don't trust the television.
[03:28:41.639 --> 03:28:43.120]  Well, what would it look like?
[03:28:43.260 --> 03:28:49.219]  What would that new force, that bright light coming in to break down that castle wall and take back the kingdom?
[03:28:49.500 --> 03:28:50.620]  It looks like this.
[03:28:50.739 --> 03:28:54.739]  And it looks like rivals that once said bad things about each other.
[03:28:55.020 --> 03:29:01.680]  I mean, think about through history, whether it was the clans, you know, you think about Braveheart in the movie and how it represents all the different clans.
[03:29:01.780 --> 03:29:05.120]  The Lord's showing up and they're all pushing around like, well, I don't know what we're going to do.
[03:29:05.239 --> 03:29:08.579]  And, you know, William Wallace rushes in there and says, I'm going to pick a fight.
[03:29:08.959 --> 03:29:09.780]  That's what I'm going to do.
[03:29:09.860 --> 03:29:12.020]  And frankly, that's been my point all along, too.
[03:29:12.180 --> 03:29:13.200]  I've been picking a fight.
[03:29:13.280 --> 03:29:14.520]  I've been poking this bear.
[03:29:14.639 --> 03:29:15.719]  I've been suing the government.
[03:29:15.879 --> 03:29:17.100]  I am going to come after you.
[03:29:17.239 --> 03:29:19.600]  I want everyone in my audience to know who you are.
[03:29:19.819 --> 03:29:22.280]  I'm winning legal cases against you.
[03:29:22.479 --> 03:29:23.559]  We've poked that bear.
[03:29:23.700 --> 03:29:24.239]  It's pissed.
[03:29:24.360 --> 03:29:25.600]  It's swinging wildly.
[03:29:25.719 --> 03:29:27.540]  It's screaming you're all a bunch of Nazis.
[03:29:27.790 --> 03:29:28.329]  It's making mistakes.
[03:29:28.610 --> 03:29:30.069]  It's making huge mistakes.
[03:29:30.309 --> 03:29:32.069]  It's a disaster area right now.
[03:29:32.190 --> 03:29:41.969]  And so we've been able to catapult ourselves into a position where if we all come together right now, if we put aside our petty little differences and we're not going to agree on everything.
[03:29:42.129 --> 03:29:43.549]  But we agree on stopping the globalists.
[03:29:43.629 --> 03:29:49.049]  We agree on stopping the globalists and standing for liberty and freedom and the right to live our lives in peace.
[03:29:49.590 --> 03:29:50.170]  Live and let.
[03:29:50.250 --> 03:29:52.069]  Live here in the United States of America.
[03:29:52.270 --> 03:29:54.950]  If that's what you believe in, then what does it look like?
[03:29:55.069 --> 03:29:56.489]  The clans are coming together.
[03:29:56.649 --> 03:30:01.229]  The Kennedys and the Gabbards and the Trumps and the, you know, Elon Musk.
[03:30:01.329 --> 03:30:02.930]  I mean, look at what he's saying he's going to do.
[03:30:03.049 --> 03:30:13.209]  He's going to ram AI so far up the ass of this government, use it for what it should be used for, not following and tracking everything we're doing, following all the lies and the deceit and the corruption.
[03:30:13.350 --> 03:30:16.090]  It's run the vaccine database with the death and illness database.
[03:30:16.569 --> 03:30:16.790]  Boom.
[03:30:16.930 --> 03:30:17.370]  Ten minutes.
[03:30:17.489 --> 03:30:17.610]  Boom.
[03:30:17.639 --> 03:30:18.040]  Boom!
[03:30:18.280 --> 03:30:18.879]  We're going to have the answer.
[03:30:18.959 --> 03:30:21.260]  Do you realize we will have the answers to vaccines?
[03:30:21.360 --> 03:30:28.639]  If you believe they're safe, all you'll have to do is run a decent AI program into that database, 10 million people, and just say, who's sicker?
[03:30:28.879 --> 03:30:29.579]  Who's healthier?
[03:30:30.100 --> 03:30:31.319]  Just go ahead and ask the question.
[03:30:31.319 --> 03:30:32.819]  And again, we already know what...
[03:30:32.819 --> 03:30:34.200]  We know what that answer is.
[03:30:34.280 --> 03:30:36.700]  New Zealand and what other government came out...
[03:30:37.079 --> 03:30:38.760]  New Zealand's got some interesting studies.
[03:30:38.899 --> 03:30:42.280]  Norway has had some interesting studies, especially around the COVID vaccines.
[03:30:42.420 --> 03:30:45.280]  But in the end, they can have this answer, and you have to know.
[03:30:45.399 --> 03:30:46.579]  I've said this to begin with.
[03:30:46.700 --> 03:30:48.879]  When we went to that meeting with Robert Kennedy Jr.
[03:30:49.219 --> 03:30:58.420]  that Donald Trump set up in 2017, we were at the NIH. They said they weren't doing any safety trials using placebos on vaccines, which is the most egregious thing to admit.
[03:30:58.680 --> 03:30:59.420]  There is.
[03:30:59.520 --> 03:31:00.280]  We say, okay, fine.
[03:31:00.399 --> 03:31:05.899]  If that's unethical, why won't you do a comparative study, the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, in that database?
[03:31:06.120 --> 03:31:06.979]  Then we'll have the answers.
[03:31:07.100 --> 03:31:08.680]  And it's that we don't know how to do that study.
[03:31:08.760 --> 03:31:10.399]  And this is what I've said from the beginning, Alex.
[03:31:10.840 --> 03:31:12.399]  You know they've done that study everywhere.
[03:31:12.639 --> 03:31:13.399]  They're obsessed with it.
[03:31:13.420 --> 03:31:14.700]  They've done that a million times.
[03:31:14.840 --> 03:31:15.940]  It's target accuracy.
[03:31:16.379 --> 03:31:20.100]  They cannot manipulate that data in a way that actually shows that vaccinated are healthier.
[03:31:20.100 --> 03:31:21.399]  Because if they could...
[03:31:21.629 --> 03:31:24.090]  If they could, it would be every headline.
[03:31:24.489 --> 03:31:29.129]  Comparative study, the biggest database in the world shows vaccinated are healthier than unvaccinated.
[03:31:29.469 --> 03:31:30.409]  Alex Jones is done.
[03:31:30.610 --> 03:31:31.329]  Del Bigtree is done.
[03:31:31.430 --> 03:31:32.110]  Robert Keddie Jr.
[03:31:32.290 --> 03:31:33.829]  We never have to hear from him again.
[03:31:34.090 --> 03:31:35.729]  Why have you never seen that headline?
[03:31:35.889 --> 03:31:40.430]  Because no matter how you slice it, vaccinated people are sicker than unvaccinated.
[03:31:40.610 --> 03:31:44.090]  They know it, and they cannot figure out how to do that study to show otherwise.
[03:31:44.350 --> 03:31:45.850]  Well, that study is going to finally get done.
[03:31:46.069 --> 03:31:51.430]  Those databases are going to finally open up, and now the world will know the truth, and what they'll know is, holy cow!
[03:31:51.459 --> 03:31:54.020]  Our governments have been lying to us.
[03:31:54.120 --> 03:31:55.360]  They've been poisoning us.
[03:31:55.459 --> 03:31:56.559]  They've been killing us.
[03:31:56.639 --> 03:31:58.760]  And they had this information the whole time.
[03:31:58.799 --> 03:32:00.479]  And we're right there, Alex.
[03:32:00.620 --> 03:32:03.000]  And right now, we've got to put aside our differences.
[03:32:03.219 --> 03:32:04.379]  We've got to stop squabbling.
[03:32:04.459 --> 03:32:07.879]  Right now, I'm seeing people saying, well, why are we talking poison food?
[03:32:08.040 --> 03:32:09.239]  I noticed Robert Kennedy Jr.
[03:32:09.379 --> 03:32:10.780]  is not talking about vaccines now.
[03:32:10.959 --> 03:32:12.100]  I mean, he just dropped everything.
[03:32:12.239 --> 03:32:13.440]  And they're making arguments.
[03:32:13.600 --> 03:32:15.149]  No, the poison food's It's another huge issue.
[03:32:15.290 --> 03:32:16.389]  It's a huge issue.
[03:32:16.409 --> 03:32:21.629]  And by the way, you're going to figure out what's going on with that the same way with drugs and guns or whatever else.
[03:32:21.709 --> 03:32:23.629]  And we're knowing it's the tobacco industry.
[03:32:23.729 --> 03:32:24.969]  And even before that, it's the same industry.
[03:32:25.049 --> 03:32:26.450]  They've been making it addictive for 80 years.
[03:32:26.629 --> 03:32:28.610]  We are so close, Alex.
[03:32:28.770 --> 03:32:31.229]  We are this close to taking back this country.
[03:32:31.370 --> 03:32:33.569]  And frankly, Donald Trump is that...
[03:32:33.719 --> 03:32:35.780]  He's that sledgehammer to pound through the wall.
[03:32:35.879 --> 03:32:43.620]  But this time, instead of him standing there alone and having a bunch of vampires glom onto him, he is surrounded by some of the most dynamic individuals.
[03:32:43.860 --> 03:32:45.479]  Honestly, presidents themselves.
[03:32:45.760 --> 03:32:48.840]  Robert Kennedy Jr., I still think, would be the greatest leader.
[03:32:49.120 --> 03:33:03.280]  We're good to go.
[03:33:15.250 --> 03:33:23.629]  I remember the moment that he introduced, after Bobby stepped down that speech, I'm going to bring this weave, as Donald Trump calls it, all the way back around.
[03:33:23.809 --> 03:33:25.729]  That morning, Robert Kennedy Jr.
[03:33:25.950 --> 03:33:28.549]  gave that speech where he says, I'm suspending my campaign.
[03:33:28.549 --> 03:33:29.629]  I'm joining Donald Trump.
[03:33:29.790 --> 03:33:31.190]  I was with him for the four weeks.
[03:33:31.290 --> 03:33:33.090]  It was one of the most difficult decisions I ever made.
[03:33:33.190 --> 03:33:34.750]  But the night before, I went into him.
[03:33:34.989 --> 03:33:36.969]  And I'll tell you, he looked like crap.
[03:33:37.440 --> 03:33:42.440]  It was weighing on him so heavy because what people don't think about, Alex, it wasn't just about the fact that he was a Kennedy.
[03:33:42.659 --> 03:33:53.159]  It wasn't just about the fact that he was once a Democrat or that his family's going to turn on or even his own children that go to family weddings and things would have to be in the black sheep family.
[03:33:53.299 --> 03:33:54.420]  All of that was weighing on him.
[03:33:54.559 --> 03:34:03.860]  But on top of that, across this country, hundreds of thousands of volunteers had worked tirelessly to get signatures to get him on the ballot in all 50 states.
[03:34:03.940 --> 03:34:06.579]  So for him to just say, yep, that doesn't matter anymore.
[03:34:06.700 --> 03:34:07.280]  I'm joining Trump.
[03:34:07.420 --> 03:34:08.840]  That weighed heavy on him.
[03:34:08.840 --> 03:34:13.340]  But the only way for him to actually deliver to them would be to make sure he brought that into the campaign.
[03:34:13.340 --> 03:34:14.020]  That was it.
[03:34:14.139 --> 03:34:16.979]  But he knew, and there still are people that are really upset.
[03:34:17.000 --> 03:34:19.659]  Why did I get you on the ballot if you were just going to turn to Trump?
[03:34:19.799 --> 03:34:22.659]  What they don't recognize is that's what gave the power.
[03:34:22.879 --> 03:34:24.840]  That's what made it appealing for Donald Trump to bring him in.
[03:34:24.840 --> 03:34:26.899]  And by the way, people ask, is he going to really bring him in?
[03:34:27.000 --> 03:34:27.920]  He's already brought him in.
[03:34:27.920 --> 03:34:29.920]  The message is exploding.
[03:34:30.079 --> 03:34:31.399]  We're having total victory.
[03:34:31.760 --> 03:34:32.659]  It's total victory.
[03:34:32.819 --> 03:34:33.940]  It's total victory right now.
[03:34:33.979 --> 03:34:35.760]  Don't explain whether they steal the election or not.
[03:34:35.940 --> 03:34:37.399]  We've won the hearts and minds.
[03:34:37.540 --> 03:34:37.920]  It's global.
[03:34:38.219 --> 03:34:38.459]  We have the people.
[03:34:38.860 --> 03:34:40.940]  Establishment candidates, globalists are being run out.
[03:34:41.139 --> 03:34:42.120]  They're in trouble everywhere.
[03:34:42.120 --> 03:34:43.860]  We're routing the damn enemy.
[03:34:44.120 --> 03:34:45.680]  That's what people need to understand.
[03:34:45.680 --> 03:34:47.360]  There's not just evil in the universe.
[03:34:47.700 --> 03:34:49.219]  People have to be ready for victory.
[03:34:49.440 --> 03:34:49.700]  Amen.
[03:34:49.700 --> 03:34:52.819]  And it's going to take you, you know, getting over being afraid.
[03:34:52.920 --> 03:34:54.139]  Like, I'm really tired of people.
[03:34:54.260 --> 03:34:55.680]  Like, oh, Del, thank you for being so brave.
[03:34:55.700 --> 03:34:57.239]  I need you to be brave.
[03:34:57.559 --> 03:34:58.940]  Don't stand out there and do all this.
[03:34:59.079 --> 03:35:01.379]  Go, oh, Alex Jones, Del Beatrix, clap.
[03:35:01.590 --> 03:35:02.290]  We can't do this alone.
[03:35:02.290 --> 03:35:03.250]  I say this every day.
[03:35:03.469 --> 03:35:04.790]  People call in and go, thanks for being brave.
[03:35:04.850 --> 03:35:09.110]  I go, I'd have to be really brave and dumb to let this evil thing continue to take over.
[03:35:09.190 --> 03:35:10.350]  I'm not doing this as I'm brave.
[03:35:10.530 --> 03:35:11.770]  It's called a survival instinct.
[03:35:11.909 --> 03:35:13.049]  What the hell do you think it is?
[03:35:13.069 --> 03:35:15.530]  I want everybody that you've got eight days right now.
[03:35:15.750 --> 03:35:17.469]  At least turn one person.
[03:35:18.049 --> 03:35:18.950]  And they don't have to be hard.
[03:35:19.069 --> 03:35:22.290]  I'm not asking you to go to your, you know, totally, you know, democratic.
[03:35:22.690 --> 03:35:23.829]  I was in a sauna.
[03:35:24.069 --> 03:35:25.229]  Turn someone this week.
[03:35:25.250 --> 03:35:28.350]  I was in a sauna this morning at a club, you know, a workout club.
[03:35:28.949 --> 03:35:30.590]  One of their 20 minutes after I worked out.
[03:35:30.870 --> 03:35:31.670]  And I'm sitting there.
[03:35:31.729 --> 03:35:32.309]  Nobody's talking.
[03:35:32.450 --> 03:35:34.049]  It's totally jam-packed because this is Monday.
[03:35:34.090 --> 03:35:35.590]  Everybody's trying to sweat out the alcohol over the weekend.
[03:35:35.649 --> 03:35:36.069]  I wasn't.
[03:35:36.629 --> 03:35:39.690]  And there's two women and like six dudes in there.
[03:35:39.989 --> 03:35:42.370]  And I just started going, so everybody voting?
[03:35:43.250 --> 03:35:44.610]  And they go, yeah, Alex.
[03:35:44.729 --> 03:35:46.750]  Like five of them are like, yeah, Alex, we already voted.
[03:35:46.870 --> 03:35:47.469]  We're going to vote.
[03:35:47.530 --> 03:35:48.149]  And the lady's like, yeah.
[03:35:48.250 --> 03:35:50.790]  And they're talking about fraud and, you know, the New World Order.
[03:35:50.969 --> 03:35:52.270]  And I'm like in a song.
[03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:54.229]  Basically, one guy didn't talk.
[03:35:54.600 --> 03:35:56.639]  I mean, that gives you an idea how big the awakening is.
[03:35:56.719 --> 03:35:57.280]  Yes, it is.
[03:35:57.360 --> 03:35:57.860]  It's huge.
[03:35:58.000 --> 03:35:58.260]  It's huge.
[03:35:58.500 --> 03:35:59.479]  And it's cab drivers.
[03:35:59.579 --> 03:36:06.000]  I've been traveling nonstop, you know, all over the country, having a blast speaking on the stage with Donald Trump.
[03:36:06.219 --> 03:36:07.120]  But you know what?
[03:36:07.399 --> 03:36:10.700]  Cab drivers, when they just bring up, you know, what do you think of Trump?
[03:36:10.879 --> 03:36:12.399]  And they're like, I was like, oh, you're asking me?
[03:36:12.520 --> 03:36:13.520]  They're like, I'm thinking about it.
[03:36:13.739 --> 03:36:17.979]  You know, it doesn't matter, black, white, yellow, red, whoever's sitting in that cab, they're talking about it.
[03:36:17.979 --> 03:36:18.819]  They're getting ready to try to convert you.
[03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:20.159]  Bartenders are talking about it.
[03:36:20.600 --> 03:36:21.600]  Waiters are bringing it up.
[03:36:21.700 --> 03:36:25.559]  We are not in the same, oh my God, you can't talk about Donald Trump anymore.
[03:36:25.940 --> 03:36:27.200]  It's why, I'll show you the ad.
[03:36:27.620 --> 03:36:29.719]  The bullying is broken.
[03:36:29.959 --> 03:36:31.840]  I made an ad especially about this.
[03:36:31.940 --> 03:36:33.799]  Can we just run really quickly, number four?
[03:36:33.920 --> 03:36:36.280]  This is a blast because this is what I actually think is happening in this case.
[03:36:36.280 --> 03:36:37.180]  It's short, here it is.
[03:36:41.879 --> 03:36:42.819]  It's a good ad, isn't it?
[03:37:04.850 --> 03:37:05.930]  Guess I don't have to hide anymore.
[03:37:07.729 --> 03:37:09.489]  So he was really always a supporter.
[03:37:09.729 --> 03:37:11.729]  And we know Trump is the biggest phenomenon.
[03:37:11.889 --> 03:37:13.690]  People are scared to say it in polling, you name it.
[03:37:13.870 --> 03:37:18.129]  And it really is a referendum on breaking the back of the establishment and the bullying.
[03:37:18.389 --> 03:37:20.389]  And so it's a lot bigger than Trump.
[03:37:20.569 --> 03:37:21.110]  It's transcendent.
[03:37:21.190 --> 03:37:22.270]  It's bigger than Trump.
[03:37:22.430 --> 03:37:23.649]  I mean, and it always is.
[03:37:23.750 --> 03:37:25.649]  There's not one person can change the world.
[03:37:25.790 --> 03:37:26.750]  And I've said that.
[03:37:27.159 --> 03:37:30.719]  But what we're looking at right now is it's a movement, right?
[03:37:30.899 --> 03:37:32.079]  And it's not just one person.
[03:37:32.139 --> 03:37:33.579]  We've said before, we've got this dream team.
[03:37:33.700 --> 03:37:38.180]  You got Bobby Kennedy, you got Tulsi Gabbard, Elon Musk, Vivek Rosami, JD Vance.
[03:37:38.340 --> 03:37:41.059]  But what we said, it's in God's hands.
[03:37:41.379 --> 03:37:43.639]  They all have a movement behind them now.
[03:37:43.959 --> 03:37:49.920]  They all have, you know, 30 to 50% of Americans that said no to the vaccine.
[03:37:49.920 --> 03:37:51.440]  I was like, I'm questioning that.
[03:37:51.639 --> 03:37:55.440]  They're questioning all the different issues that, you know, respect Elon Musk.
[03:37:55.559 --> 03:37:59.739]  They just watched him, as Trump said so many times, land a rocket, you know, and get caught.
[03:38:00.599 --> 03:38:01.319]  Forget Nassau.
[03:38:01.479 --> 03:38:03.760]  Let's get a guy in here that pulls off miracles.
[03:38:03.760 --> 03:38:05.799]  By the way, I sent you that clip yesterday.
[03:38:06.020 --> 03:38:07.639]  It's Joe Rogan talking about the...
[03:38:07.639 --> 03:38:12.719]  I mean, Elon, a few years ago, goes, I want a giant arm to grab it to make sure it doesn't get damaged.
[03:38:12.959 --> 03:38:14.159]  And then it's like...
[03:38:14.159 --> 03:38:17.879]  I mean, the thing is like a 50-story building and it lands with a big robot arm.
[03:38:18.360 --> 03:38:20.120]  You would think that...
[03:38:21.159 --> 03:38:23.079]  When you're going to choose a side, which side do you want to choose?
[03:38:23.239 --> 03:38:27.819]  You want to choose the side that says, I have technology that's going to find out where our expenditures are gone.
[03:38:27.940 --> 03:38:31.280]  I'm going to track down the people that have been committing fraud inside of our government.
[03:38:31.459 --> 03:38:42.940]  I think I'll hand it to the guy that built the Tesla that has the top-running AI and just caught a 50-story building out of the sky that fell to Earth in a hand and didn't damage it so he can use it again.
[03:38:43.239 --> 03:38:47.579]  These are the types of people around Donald Trump right now, and he knows it.
[03:38:47.819 --> 03:38:48.620]  They know it.
[03:38:48.700 --> 03:38:49.899]  Remember, they know each other.
[03:38:50.219 --> 03:38:53.700]  So, you know, you got to hand it to President Trump right now.
[03:38:53.819 --> 03:38:59.819]  When you bring in individuals that powerful around you, you got to have the type of confidence that he has.
[03:39:00.139 --> 03:39:02.000]  Something really dynamic is here.
[03:39:02.139 --> 03:39:04.540]  And so what I'm saying, it's that Braveheart moment.
[03:39:04.600 --> 03:39:06.159]  Are we going to take this castle or not?
[03:39:06.280 --> 03:39:08.180]  Or are we going to stand right out here at the moment?
[03:39:08.219 --> 03:39:10.379]  We're finally there to say, I don't know if he's the guy.
[03:39:10.540 --> 03:39:11.420]  I don't know if I agree.
[03:39:11.899 --> 03:39:12.840]  Well, let me say this.
[03:39:13.100 --> 03:39:15.020]  32 million Christians in Big...
[03:39:27.620 --> 03:39:30.420]  You know...
[03:39:30.600 --> 03:39:40.260]  I don't think, when we look at our founding fathers, which is I grew up a liberal, I look back now and I hate his stories about our founding fathers, and we talk about their failures as human beings.
[03:39:40.260 --> 03:39:49.139]  They had slaves, definitely, they had their issues, they had multiple wives, whatever the case, but God moves from, look at Paul and Saul, look at Saul, right?
[03:39:49.799 --> 03:39:54.680]  God moves through people that maybe don't look like you expected a great person.
[03:39:54.680 --> 03:39:56.440]  Saul of Tarsus hunted down Christians.
[03:39:56.639 --> 03:40:00.040]  You know, hunted down Christians before God speaks through him.
[03:40:00.180 --> 03:40:02.459]  Right now, and I want to say this about Robert Kennedy Jr.
[03:40:02.819 --> 03:40:04.780]  I wouldn't say he's a religious person.
[03:40:04.780 --> 03:40:07.260]  I'd say he was probably one of the most spiritual people ever.
[03:40:08.199 --> 03:40:10.299]  For me, the most spiritual person's ever run.
[03:40:10.579 --> 03:40:10.780]  You can tell.
[03:40:12.020 --> 03:40:14.500]  God moves for that guy every day.
[03:40:14.639 --> 03:40:17.780]  Every decision he's making, he's waiting to be guided.
[03:40:18.020 --> 03:40:19.180]  He walks in faith.
[03:40:19.340 --> 03:40:25.819]  He made this decision to join Donald Trump because in deep prayer, he realized, put my ego aside.
[03:40:26.040 --> 03:40:29.799]  Put all of the things that would say you shouldn't do this and all the headlines that are there.
[03:40:29.979 --> 03:40:31.860]  Am I going to get to heal children here?
[03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:34.139]  And he said, I don't see any other option.
[03:40:34.260 --> 03:40:34.459]  I will.
[03:40:34.739 --> 03:40:35.879]  Kamala's not going to let me do that.
[03:40:36.190 --> 03:40:36.610]  Let's be clear.
[03:40:36.770 --> 03:40:37.370]  Let's be clear.
[03:40:37.370 --> 03:40:39.450]  He was huge being suppressed before that.
[03:40:39.930 --> 03:40:41.549]  People say, is he coming in?
[03:40:41.629 --> 03:40:42.469]  It's already happened.
[03:40:42.629 --> 03:40:43.350]  It's already the dominant.
[03:40:43.510 --> 03:40:44.010]  It's everywhere.
[03:40:44.250 --> 03:40:46.069]  And of course, people say, oh, it's all the vaccines.
[03:40:46.250 --> 03:40:47.469]  No, it all ties together.
[03:40:47.909 --> 03:40:50.190]  Big pharma, big food, all the same thing.
[03:40:50.290 --> 03:40:52.809]  The insurance companies, the chemicals in the water.
[03:40:53.690 --> 03:40:55.569]  We're annihilating them right now.
[03:40:56.040 --> 03:40:56.440]  This is massive.
[03:40:56.559 --> 03:41:01.780]  This is a, you know, as Tulsi Gabbard just said the other day, this is a disruptive government.
[03:41:01.780 --> 03:41:06.120]  And it's weird that word's tough because I was just at a conference, like a disrupt conference.
[03:41:06.340 --> 03:41:15.100]  I was like, that's a word that gives me PTSD because disruptive was always my parents coming home from my third grade class after a parent-teacher meeting saying, your teacher said you were disruptive.
[03:41:15.100 --> 03:41:16.879]  And it meant I was like grounded for two weeks.
[03:41:17.129 --> 03:41:19.590]  You're fighting Hitler in World War II. You're disruptive of Hitler.
[03:41:19.889 --> 03:41:20.290]  Exactly.
[03:41:20.530 --> 03:41:27.690]  So now, you know, I've come to terms with there's disrupting, you know, a business and having a deal and looking at it.
[03:41:27.870 --> 03:41:28.750]  That's what's happening here.
[03:41:28.750 --> 03:41:36.629]  When Congress attacked me and stuff, and FBI memos leaked like eight years ago, they said, we keep tracking back so much of what's going on, the disruption to Infowars.
[03:41:36.920 --> 03:41:38.020]  I'm not trying to bring myself in.
[03:41:38.059 --> 03:41:39.180]  They used that term, disruptive.
[03:41:39.420 --> 03:41:42.700]  And then we know with the FBI and CIA coming after me, they said disrupt him.
[03:41:42.879 --> 03:41:43.040]  Right.
[03:41:43.180 --> 03:41:44.159]  That's the term they use.
[03:41:44.299 --> 03:41:44.639]  Guess what?
[03:41:44.700 --> 03:41:46.379]  Our founding fathers were disruptive.
[03:41:46.559 --> 03:41:47.139]  Very disruptive.
[03:41:47.239 --> 03:41:48.340]  You know, they were very disruptive.
[03:41:48.420 --> 03:41:49.559]  They didn't like what they were seeing.
[03:41:49.860 --> 03:41:52.020]  You know, they didn't want to be under the king any longer.
[03:41:52.059 --> 03:41:53.540]  And let me stop you here because we've got to do this.
[03:41:53.680 --> 03:41:53.799]  Okay.
[03:41:53.979 --> 03:41:56.940]  Yes, we're winning humanity, but they're coming after everybody.
[03:41:56.940 --> 03:41:57.899]  They're coming after Trump.
[03:41:58.020 --> 03:41:58.739]  They're coming after Kennedy.
[03:41:59.040 --> 03:41:59.840]  We need your support.
[03:41:59.840 --> 03:42:00.899]  And you don't even come here and do this.
[03:42:01.649 --> 03:42:04.049]  Folks, I need your support because I'm backed by the people.
[03:42:04.170 --> 03:42:05.629]  I need to go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:42:05.729 --> 03:42:07.690]  We can be shut down in 14 days.
[03:42:08.600 --> 03:42:10.700]  They're doing all these lawsuits trying to take my name.
[03:42:10.799 --> 03:42:11.540]  People say they can't do that.
[03:42:11.659 --> 03:42:12.520]  Well, I got to defend those.
[03:42:12.700 --> 03:42:13.319]  We're going to win.
[03:42:13.440 --> 03:42:13.920]  We're already winning.
[03:42:14.020 --> 03:42:15.100]  The judge shut them down last week.
[03:42:15.219 --> 03:42:19.340]  That took high-powered lawyers and that, you know, 50 grand right there to have those briefs ready, okay?
[03:42:19.520 --> 03:42:20.920]  This is total war.
[03:42:21.299 --> 03:42:22.440]  We make it easy.
[03:42:22.520 --> 03:42:25.399]  Great supplements, great t-shirts, great everything.
[03:42:25.659 --> 03:42:27.379]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:42:27.500 --> 03:42:28.520]  Come a VIP member.

[03:42:30.659 --> 03:42:31.520]  You make 10 bucks on that.
[03:42:31.659 --> 03:42:32.760]  It reminds you, go back to the store.
[03:42:33.079 --> 03:42:35.219]  Incredible supplements, the ultimate CMOS, superfood.
[03:42:35.360 --> 03:42:37.809]  It's all there at The Alex Jones Store.
[03:42:38.469 --> 03:42:39.290]  Thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:42:39.409 --> 03:42:40.530]  My dad's a great supplement company.
[03:42:41.350 --> 03:42:42.229]  drjonesnatorals.com.
[03:42:42.489 --> 03:42:44.270]  That's how we're funding this operation.
[03:42:44.409 --> 03:42:54.909]  Separate from InfoWars, you go there, you get t-shirts, you get ball caps, you spread the word, you meet like-minded people, you're a walking billboard for freedom, it's a great adventure, and you know you're funding our operation.
[03:42:54.969 --> 03:42:55.690]  We need funds.
[03:42:55.770 --> 03:42:56.149]  I'm about...
[03:42:56.590 --> 03:42:58.049]  This week, you'll see it in the news.
[03:42:58.389 --> 03:43:00.309]  I'm going on offense against these people, okay?
[03:43:00.629 --> 03:43:01.450]  You keep wanting me to do it?
[03:43:01.530 --> 03:43:02.270]  Well, it takes money.
[03:43:02.409 --> 03:43:04.690]  And I'll go on the offense and just hope the money comes in.
[03:43:04.750 --> 03:43:05.709]  But we're going on the offense.
[03:43:05.870 --> 03:43:06.530]  We caught them.
[03:43:06.590 --> 03:43:07.309]  We got the documents.
[03:43:07.430 --> 03:43:10.110]  I told you I'll sue the CIA and FBI. Get ready.
[03:43:10.409 --> 03:43:11.629]  First steps start this week.
[03:43:11.649 --> 03:43:12.409]  And the enemy already knows.
[03:43:13.250 --> 03:43:15.209]  But I need money to do it.
[03:43:15.250 --> 03:43:17.270]  And look, I don't even think about my life or any of that.
[03:43:17.309 --> 03:43:17.850]  That doesn't matter.
[03:43:17.889 --> 03:43:18.569]  I'm on this mission.
[03:43:18.590 --> 03:43:19.129]  I love it.
[03:43:19.170 --> 03:43:19.649]  This is great.
[03:43:20.129 --> 03:43:22.170]  But I need funds to fight a war.
[03:43:22.670 --> 03:43:23.649]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[03:43:24.309 --> 03:43:25.270]  DrJonesNationals.com.
[03:43:25.370 --> 03:43:27.430]  Those are the coordinates of the resistance.
[03:43:27.590 --> 03:43:29.250]  I need your support now.
[03:43:29.389 --> 03:43:30.229]  There are great products.
[03:43:30.370 --> 03:43:32.389]  Take Action History is happening now.
[03:43:33.159 --> 03:43:34.540]  Del, people need to support you as well.
[03:43:34.579 --> 03:43:35.020]  How do they do it?
[03:43:35.360 --> 03:43:36.620]  Alex, first of all, I want to thank you.
[03:43:36.799 --> 03:43:42.040]  It just shows how awesome you are that you'll bring somebody on and say, go ahead and ask for money yourself.
[03:43:42.200 --> 03:43:44.399]  But first of all, give to Alex Jones.
[03:43:44.559 --> 03:43:50.020]  I don't want this guy to have to be wearing a symbol and we're all going to say, the truth teller formerly known as Alex Jones.
[03:43:50.100 --> 03:43:51.280]  Let's not let that happen.
[03:43:51.500 --> 03:43:53.020]  Oh, they're trying to make an example out of me.
[03:43:53.440 --> 03:43:56.020]  I'm not that important, but I've become a rallying point.
[03:43:56.159 --> 03:43:58.360]  I've become like a Roman standard they want to capture.
[03:43:58.579 --> 03:43:59.040]  Explain that.
[03:43:59.100 --> 03:43:59.459]  You're...
[03:43:59.549 --> 03:44:08.469]  Look, I mean, if we don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the First Amendment, if, you know, media, which is, look, it never said only newspapers or the media.
[03:44:08.649 --> 03:44:17.489]  It was anyone that wants to challenge government, anyone that's willing to put the feet to the fire of corporate interests of your government, that is supposed to be free.
[03:44:17.629 --> 03:44:18.649]  Electronic soapbox.
[03:44:19.139 --> 03:44:23.319]  In the end, if you lose, Alex, we all lose.
[03:44:23.440 --> 03:44:29.680]  We will all lose the ability to do tough stories, to take risks, to plant flags where we think there's an issue.
[03:44:29.860 --> 03:44:30.979]  Sometime we'll get it wrong.
[03:44:31.139 --> 03:44:33.180]  I said before, you do a daily show.
[03:44:33.319 --> 03:44:35.079]  It's impossible to nail that to the wall.
[03:44:35.180 --> 03:44:36.120]  I do a weekly show.
[03:44:36.260 --> 03:44:37.659]  I spend more time vetting it.
[03:44:37.760 --> 03:44:38.639]  They're two different animals.
[03:44:38.780 --> 03:44:39.840]  They can't be compared to each other.
[03:44:39.840 --> 03:44:41.180]  They also take stuff out of context.
[03:44:41.319 --> 03:44:41.780]  I'm exaggerating.
[03:44:41.809 --> 03:44:43.170]  Absolutely, that's true.
[03:44:43.329 --> 03:44:44.430]  All right, so let me get back to...
[03:44:44.430 --> 03:44:46.069]  Look, there's two things you can do.
[03:44:46.069 --> 03:44:49.350]  If you really want to get involved in the lawsuits that we have going, I'll look over here.
[03:44:49.409 --> 03:44:53.549]  The lawsuits that we have going, then go to thehighwire.com.
[03:44:53.629 --> 03:44:55.209]  Check out the show I do every Thursday.
[03:44:55.590 --> 03:44:56.469]  Boom, right there.
[03:44:57.110 --> 03:44:58.850]  And you can donate there.
[03:44:58.989 --> 03:45:00.889]  I'll also hit you up if you're watching the show.
[03:45:01.010 --> 03:45:02.909]  But all of that work is really important.
[03:45:03.129 --> 03:45:03.969]  You can help there.
[03:45:04.069 --> 03:45:05.110]  But right now...
[03:45:05.280 --> 03:45:06.719]  Right now, I have eight days.
[03:45:06.899 --> 03:45:09.219]  I built Maha Alliance just over a month ago.
[03:45:09.399 --> 03:45:11.340]  You've been watching these ads the whole time.
[03:45:11.420 --> 03:45:12.540]  They're not like anything you've seen.
[03:45:12.680 --> 03:45:19.040]  They're also designed to be going after the candidate voters and move them over to Donald Trump.
[03:45:19.180 --> 03:45:23.200]  We truly believe that those are the only voters that are really available to Donald Trump.
[03:45:23.340 --> 03:45:25.340]  He's got MAGA. He's got all of you.
[03:45:25.549 --> 03:45:33.030]  But we need those people that were supporting the independent spirit of Robert Kennedy Jr., you know, that take back America and clean up the regulatory agencies.
[03:45:33.090 --> 03:45:40.350]  So I've made ads that are going to target them in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.
[03:45:40.750 --> 03:45:41.049]  Share them.
[03:45:41.209 --> 03:45:41.569]  Donate.
[03:45:41.790 --> 03:45:43.489]  So go to mahaalliance.com.
[03:45:43.590 --> 03:45:47.530]  Your $5, your $10 helps me push it into another commercial.
[03:45:47.629 --> 03:45:49.069]  I want to buy another commercial spot.
[03:45:49.209 --> 03:45:50.729]  We put a million dollars in Pennsylvania.
[03:45:50.930 --> 03:45:52.270]  We put a million dollars in Wisconsin.
[03:45:52.489 --> 03:45:53.770]  Put a million dollars in Michigan.
[03:45:54.110 --> 03:45:55.149]  I want to put a million dollars.
[03:45:55.209 --> 03:45:56.850]  Can we show the ad that Mickey Willis made?
[03:45:57.030 --> 03:45:57.270]  Yeah.
[03:45:57.370 --> 03:45:59.329]  I want a million dollars behind this one ad.
[03:45:59.329 --> 03:45:59.829]  Which one?
[03:45:59.829 --> 03:46:00.409]  There's a bunch of them.
[03:46:00.469 --> 03:46:01.610]  This is the Dear Kamala.
[03:46:01.729 --> 03:46:02.090]  Oh my gosh.
[03:46:02.670 --> 03:46:03.750]  Play it now.
[03:46:03.770 --> 03:46:04.090]  Play it now.
[03:46:04.149 --> 03:46:04.950]  It's exactly enough time.
[03:46:05.030 --> 03:46:05.329]  Here it is.
[03:46:06.149 --> 03:46:07.649]  Go ahead and play Dear Kamala.
[03:46:08.760 --> 03:46:12.780]  Dear Kamala Harris, let's get one thing crystal clear.
[03:46:13.180 --> 03:46:18.500]  The vast majority of American men have no issue with electing a female president.
[03:46:20.069 --> 03:46:22.329]  Our issue lies solely with you.
[03:46:22.930 --> 03:46:26.729]  You were second in charge of California for 13 years.
[03:46:26.950 --> 03:46:35.370]  As California's Attorney General, Harris promoted enforcement of a law that allowed prosecutors to seek jail time for parents of truant kids.
[03:46:35.530 --> 03:46:38.850]  As a prosecutor and law enforcement, I have a huge stick.
[03:46:39.030 --> 03:46:43.610]  So I decided I was going to start prosecuting parents for truancy.
[03:46:43.950 --> 03:46:45.270]  I thought that was crazy.
[03:46:45.510 --> 03:46:49.770]  I was like, how can you lock parents up?
[03:46:49.950 --> 03:46:53.750]  If you don't go to school, Kamala's gonna put you and me in jail.
[03:46:55.870 --> 03:46:58.149]  Yes, we achieved an intended effect.
[03:46:58.969 --> 03:47:04.489]  I opened the door and I see at least seven or eight cops that wanted to arrest me.
[03:47:04.629 --> 03:47:05.389]  As a matter of fact, they did.
[03:47:05.549 --> 03:47:09.069]  And frankly, you know the prosecutors in my office who volunteered to do this?
[03:47:09.920 --> 03:47:11.500]  My homicide prosecutors.
[03:47:11.860 --> 03:47:13.799]  My gang prosecutors.
[03:47:14.639 --> 03:47:17.639]  And they went over there and I said, when you go over there, look really mean.
[03:47:18.059 --> 03:47:26.620]  She had me arrested and prosecuted because my handicapped daughter was sick in the hospital and had missed some days of school.
[03:47:26.840 --> 03:47:34.420]  I learned That with the swipe of my pen, I could charge someone with the lowest level offense.
[03:47:34.659 --> 03:47:36.239]  That person could be arrested.
[03:47:36.360 --> 03:47:40.280]  They could lose time from work and their family maybe lose their job.
[03:47:40.459 --> 03:47:43.760]  They'd have to come out of their own pocket to help hire a lawyer.
[03:47:44.000 --> 03:47:45.920]  They'd lose standing in their community.
[03:47:46.180 --> 03:47:50.940]  I lost my job and couldn't pay rent and we got evicted.
[03:47:51.719 --> 03:47:56.520]  Weeks later, I could dismiss the charges, but their life would forever be changed.
[03:47:56.780 --> 03:47:57.920]  I became homeless.
[03:47:58.200 --> 03:47:59.920]  We had to move into a motel.
[03:48:00.100 --> 03:48:02.879]  All because of the swipe of my pen.
[03:48:03.079 --> 03:48:09.500]  I don't agree what Kamala Harris did to my mom, and I don't agree with what she's done to other parents as well.
[03:48:09.719 --> 03:48:13.079]  You were second in charge of the United States for four years.
[03:48:13.280 --> 03:48:18.819]  If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?
[03:48:19.959 --> 03:48:27.659]  There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of, and I've been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact.
[03:48:27.819 --> 03:48:30.899]  Inflation is hitting the highest level in 39 years.
[03:48:31.280 --> 03:48:33.000]  A record high number of illegal crossings.
[03:48:33.100 --> 03:48:35.059]  Crime's been surging across the nation.
[03:48:35.239 --> 03:48:36.600]  Huge spikes in homicide.
[03:48:36.719 --> 03:48:45.139]  Could we be heading toward World War III? After 17 years of failed leadership, you are now asking us to trust you as first in charge of our country.
[03:48:45.629 --> 03:48:48.069]  I am concerned and focused on big issues.
[03:48:48.489 --> 03:48:53.649]  Elementary and middle school truancy is actually a big issue if we're trying to save the state money.
[03:48:53.850 --> 03:49:00.170]  Because of truancy, California public schools lose $1.4 billion a year in funding.
[03:49:00.489 --> 03:49:01.549]  I want money.
[03:49:03.790 --> 03:49:10.069]  My message to all Americans, do not trust Kamala Harris.
[03:49:10.739 --> 03:49:17.639]  As men and protectors of women and children, you are simply a risk we are not willing to take.
[03:49:19.639 --> 03:49:21.979]  Paid for by Maha Alliance.
[03:49:22.520 --> 03:49:25.959]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is history happening.
[03:49:26.079 --> 03:49:27.780]  The revolution against tyranny is now.
[03:49:28.000 --> 03:49:29.120]  God bless you all.
[03:49:29.219 --> 03:49:30.180]  Owen Schroer coming up now.
[03:49:30.340 --> 03:49:31.940]  Please support us at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:49:31.940 --> 03:49:32.600]  I need your help.
[03:49:33.100 --> 03:49:34.420]  You see it everywhere.
[03:49:34.680 --> 03:49:35.719]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:49:35.860 --> 03:49:36.940]  Alex Jones is vindicated.
[03:49:37.930 --> 03:49:45.809]  I personally appreciate folks that defend me because I've been through a lot of attacks from the deep state and the corporate media and their minions.
[03:49:46.510 --> 03:49:52.649]  But really, it's more important to me that people realize that I've not been playing games and I've been accurate about 98% of the time.
[03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:54.430]  I've never gotten things wrong on purpose.
[03:49:54.569 --> 03:49:55.610]  I've never lied to you on purpose.
[03:49:55.750 --> 03:49:56.290]  I've made mistakes.
[03:49:57.149 --> 03:50:04.389]  The reason I like the vindication is people can now pay more attention to what I'm currently saying about what's happening in the world.
[03:50:04.590 --> 03:50:08.629]  And we're reaching tens of millions of new people every day.
[03:50:08.870 --> 03:50:10.309]  I mean, this is amazing.
[03:50:10.950 --> 03:50:13.149]  Just on X alone, but all over the place.
[03:50:13.329 --> 03:50:14.610]  And that's thanks to you spreading the word.
[03:50:15.030 --> 03:50:18.409]  But there's one part of the equation that if it fails, the whole thing falls.
[03:50:19.309 --> 03:50:26.629]  Infowars is up for sale, could easily be shut down on November 13th, a few days after the election, which we now know is going to be contested.
[03:50:27.159 --> 03:50:29.280]  And the deep state wants me off really, really bad.
[03:50:29.420 --> 03:50:39.040]  But regardless of that, if our sponsors are backed, there's been backup systems set up and things are ready to continue on regardless of what happens.
[03:50:39.040 --> 03:50:43.440]  But the funds are not there to make sure we can hire the whole crew, the folks I'm working with.
[03:50:43.520 --> 03:50:47.639]  The funds are not there yet to make sure we get the rest of the equipment that's needed with the folks I'm working with.
[03:50:47.879 --> 03:50:50.200]  So I need you to support my sponsors.
[03:50:50.200 --> 03:50:52.020]  Plus, it's really easy to do.
[03:50:52.819 --> 03:50:58.479]  These are amazing products with five-star reviews with my dad's company, drjonesnaturals.com.

[03:51:41.239 --> 03:51:43.979]  This isn't an energy pill, but it gives you energy.
[03:51:44.319 --> 03:51:54.420]  It is the breakdown that the cells create of folic acid, methylfolate with a bunch of other natural compounds that supercharge it into the cells like Organic B Complex.
[03:51:57.920 --> 03:52:01.959]  This cleans out the mitochondria, gives you instant energy within 30 minutes with no letdown.
[03:52:02.120 --> 03:52:03.100]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:52:03.219 --> 03:52:08.239]  And a lot of people have issues with processing folic acid, particularly Northern Europeans.
[03:52:08.639 --> 03:52:09.920]  But everybody feels it.
[03:52:10.040 --> 03:52:14.760]  But if you've had an issue in your cells, you can have genetics tested for this if you want.
[03:52:14.840 --> 03:52:15.260]  A lot of people do.
[03:52:15.520 --> 03:52:19.559]  And you find out you've got broken genes for absorbing folic acid.
[03:52:20.350 --> 03:52:24.190]  Be careful and just take one pill the first time because it's crazy.
[03:52:24.469 --> 03:52:27.170]  You want to experience next level foundational energy.

[03:52:58.899 --> 03:53:00.760]  They're like, wow, this is something else.
[03:53:00.860 --> 03:53:02.139]  Yeah, we're not playing games.
[03:53:02.420 --> 03:53:06.979]  And then, of course, there's a good, high-quality, staple, organic base, so it's not synthetic.
[03:53:07.319 --> 03:53:10.620]  Whole food, concentrate, multivitamin, good basis.
[03:53:12.159 --> 03:53:13.000]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[03:53:13.180 --> 03:53:14.280]  Foundation for everything you're doing?
[03:53:14.379 --> 03:53:15.180]  That's a good staple.

[03:53:34.899 --> 03:53:40.200]  I mean, no acid that only your intestines can create that helps regrow, you know, tendons, muscle.
[03:53:40.379 --> 03:53:42.219]  I mean, it's gut wall health.
[03:53:42.379 --> 03:53:44.639]  You want to get fiber green concentrates.

[03:53:59.639 --> 03:54:04.579]  Um, If we had some big billionaires that wouldn't control what I said, wouldn't have given me money, I would take it.
[03:54:04.639 --> 03:54:05.360]  But that's not happening.
[03:54:05.540 --> 03:54:10.579]  I'm backed by common folks just like you, just like Trump mainly is backed by small donations.
[03:54:10.879 --> 03:54:13.319]  And so you can see it as a donation, but it's not.
[03:54:13.500 --> 03:54:15.500]  I want to form a long-term relationship with you.

[03:54:30.959 --> 03:54:32.620]  My dad wants the line around the block.
[03:54:32.799 --> 03:54:35.299]  So you got to try it to see how great it is.

[03:58:50.940 --> 03:58:55.500]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[03:58:55.700 --> 03:58:56.920]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[03:58:57.680 --> 03:58:58.659]  Yellowshowstore.com.
[03:58:59.200 --> 03:59:04.940]  It's up to you whether you want to back The number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[03:59:05.200 --> 03:59:14.260]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[03:59:14.440 --> 03:59:21.520]  And I just don't know why I'm such a lovable, friendly person, but Satanists and pedophiles do not like me.
[03:59:21.659 --> 03:59:23.659]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[03:59:24.180 --> 03:59:26.620]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[03:59:27.079 --> 03:59:27.860]  We've already...
[03:59:28.739 --> 03:59:29.819]  Just devastated them.
[03:59:29.940 --> 03:59:32.959]  I mean, world government, the New World Orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[03:59:33.200 --> 03:59:34.540]  The whole world's turning against them.
[03:59:35.020 --> 03:59:36.120]  They're super dangerous.
[03:59:36.260 --> 03:59:38.819]  They're throwing the kitchen sink at us to try to keep control.
[03:59:39.260 --> 03:59:49.500]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've ever understood, that I should let these criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[03:59:49.700 --> 03:59:51.299]  So, again, I don't give up.
[03:59:51.440 --> 03:59:54.180]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[03:59:54.690 --> 03:59:57.790]  I mean, I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[03:59:58.010 --> 04:00:00.270]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[04:00:00.389 --> 04:00:01.750]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[04:00:01.909 --> 04:00:10.450]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control overs with a social credit score and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[04:00:10.649 --> 04:00:15.450]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum.
[04:00:16.590 --> 04:00:18.809]  And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[04:00:20.459 --> 04:00:21.299]  I mean, it's just...
[04:00:21.299 --> 04:00:22.659]  This is a joke.
[04:00:22.959 --> 04:00:24.120]  This is ridiculous.
[04:00:24.600 --> 04:00:25.700]  We're changing the world.
[04:00:25.819 --> 04:00:28.659]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
