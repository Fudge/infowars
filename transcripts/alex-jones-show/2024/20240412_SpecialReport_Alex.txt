[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:07.152]  The desperate deep state has been forced to reveal itself, to emerge from the shadows because the global awakening is so massive.
[00:00:07.472 --> 00:00:21.297]  There are now congressional hearings on FISA and the warrantless wiretapping and spying on the American people where they're openly discussing the FBI and CIA's operations against myself and Tucker Carlson designed to destroy us.
[00:00:21.857 --> 00:00:24.498]  The entire House of Cards is coming down now.
[00:00:24.978 --> 00:00:27.280]  You can kind of put anyone in jail if you know what to do.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.861]  How?
[00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:28.701]  You set them up.
[00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:30.423]  Does the Bureau practice entrapment a lot?
[00:00:31.444 --> 00:00:32.265]  We get really close.
[00:00:32.385 --> 00:00:33.706]  We call it a nudge.
[00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:34.547]  A nudge?
[00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:35.507]  A nudge.
[00:00:36.188 --> 00:00:36.368]  Mmm.
[00:00:36.508 --> 00:00:39.331]  Sometimes you just gotta get a quick little... just to see what happens.
[00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:41.873]  Sometimes you light the fuse and just wait for it to follow.
[00:00:42.253 --> 00:00:44.976]  Nothing like putting out a fake social media thing to like really get people mad.
[00:00:45.376 --> 00:00:50.947]  The undercover footage of Gavin Oblenus, former FBI, current CIA, has taken the internet by storm.
[00:00:51.287 --> 00:00:52.470]  Hundreds of millions of people have seen it.
[00:00:52.991 --> 00:00:55.595]  But this is only a tiny window into this world.
[00:00:56.698 --> 00:01:03.885]  Where they're openly admitting that they're targeting Tucker Carlson, targeting Alex Jones, putting us on list, trying to shut us down.
[00:01:04.285 --> 00:01:12.073]  Remember three years ago, Tucker Carlson said, hey, I just got told by high-level sources the NSA spying on me and giving it illegally to the Washington Post, his text messages.
[00:01:12.453 --> 00:01:15.716]  And the Washington Post came out and said, you're right, we are, and here's your text messages.
[00:01:16.497 --> 00:01:23.159]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is total, warrantless, lawless tyranny to suppress the people.
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.581]  And it is the greatest threat facing our nation and the world.
[00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:28.481]  Do you trust the government?
[00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:33.103]  In 2021, the FBI conducted over 3 million FISA searches of Americas.
[00:01:33.563 --> 00:01:38.925]  And in 2022, the FBI was still conducting hundreds of such warrantless queries per day.
[00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:42.307]  We often hear the claim that it's for your safety.
[00:01:42.927 --> 00:01:46.028]  So do you think that members of Congress get spied on through these loopholes?
[00:01:46.624 --> 00:01:46.824]  Yes.
[00:01:47.745 --> 00:01:46.824]  100%.
[00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:53.188]  In fact, I'm quite confident in some capacity that I'm sure I'm on the list.
[00:01:53.268 --> 00:02:01.953]  The FBI conducted over 278,000 searches of the 702 FISA database that violated the Justice Department's own rules.
[00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:08.417]  Anytime the government tells us it's for your safety, the American people really question what that means.
[00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:13.631]  Alex Jones, if you're listening, Alex Jones, you have a right to be a little bit flustered, right?
[00:02:13.991 --> 00:02:19.815]  Your feathers should be flustered right now with what that agent, that former CIA guy, or that CIA guy said about you.
[00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:21.136]  And same with Tucker.
[00:02:21.536 --> 00:02:23.517]  I'll tell you, go after him, go after him.
[00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:29.301]  This weaponization that the Republicans have said has happened with the DOJ, it's true, America.
[00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:35.384]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:02:36.405 --> 00:02:37.686]  InfoWars.com forward slash go.
[00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:47.624]  We are about to break information critically vital, not just to the future of America, but the future of free peoples across the world.
[00:02:48.425 --> 00:03:00.592]  Myself, my crew, my organization, and my family have been the victims in the last seven years of a CIA, Justice Department, FBI, globalist attack.
[00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:05.956]  Now, I didn't understand the full scope of this until just the last year.
[00:03:06.823 --> 00:03:13.288]  But listeners and viewers have heard me break down the fact that it was a CIA-FBI coordinated operation.
[00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:17.652]  It's now begun to come out in just the last week.
[00:03:18.112 --> 00:03:29.702]  There have been congressional hearings, there have been documents, there have been operatives who've been caught in clandestine recordings, and even more is set to come out in the next week to two weeks.
[00:03:30.363 --> 00:03:32.845]  So this information is explosive.
[00:03:33.482 --> 00:03:41.524]  Now, a lot of the regular viewers and listeners of my syndicated daily show know the details of this, but we've talked about it in chunks and pieces.
[00:03:41.984 --> 00:03:47.446]  Now we're going to lay it all out succinctly with the new information here today.
[00:03:47.606 --> 00:03:48.766]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:03:48.806 --> 00:03:50.867]  Let's start going through the articles and start here.
[00:03:51.907 --> 00:03:57.749]  GOP lawmakers condemn CIA, FBI attack against Alex Jones.
[00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:01.292]  And this is in congressional hearings and in interviews.
[00:04:01.712 --> 00:04:09.654]  Breaking Republican congressmen and women call for official investigation to FBI, CIA set up of Alex Jones.
[00:04:09.714 --> 00:04:26.478]  Representative Troy Nels, Representative Paulina Luna, Representative Mike Lee, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene and more are now calling for official hearings and criminal investigations of the information that's broken in the last week.
[00:04:26.858 --> 00:04:31.479]  Alex Jones, if you're listening, Alex Jones, you have a right to be a little bit flustered, right?
[00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:37.660]  Your feathers should be flustered right now with what that agent, that former CIA guy or that CIA guy said about you.
[00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:38.981]  And same with Tucker.
[00:04:39.381 --> 00:04:41.381]  I'll tell you, go after him, go after him.
[00:04:41.721 --> 00:04:45.782]  This weaponization that the Republicans have said has happened with the DOJ.
[00:04:46.142 --> 00:04:47.163]  It's true, America.
[00:04:47.443 --> 00:04:48.843]  They're coming after Donald Trump.
[00:04:48.863 --> 00:04:51.604]  They're coming after anybody that's a mega movement individual.
[00:04:51.944 --> 00:04:52.844]  We got to push back.
[00:04:53.524 --> 00:04:54.084]  Let's win!
[00:04:54.724 --> 00:05:17.632]  It's important to understand that the information that broke four days ago, the former FBI and current CIA operative Gavin Oblemus' revelations, that indeed the agencies were working in tandem against myself and my operation to quote, cut our legs off and attempt to dial back or suppress the reach we have, warning the public about the globalist operations.
[00:05:18.192 --> 00:05:20.514]  You can kind of put anyone in jail if you know what to do.
[00:05:20.794 --> 00:05:21.074]  How?
[00:05:21.234 --> 00:05:22.115]  Who set him up?
[00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:22.695]  Alex Jones.
[00:05:22.735 --> 00:05:24.657]  Yeah, so, we were after him.
[00:05:24.897 --> 00:05:26.018]  Was that court case used?
[00:05:26.578 --> 00:05:27.159]  Was that a CIA case?
[00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:29.901]  It sure was, but we were looking at all of his followers.
[00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:33.343]  Thomas, Paul, who's up in the latest, right?
[00:05:33.884 --> 00:05:36.245]  Does the Bureau practice entrapment a lot?
[00:05:36.345 --> 00:05:37.266]  Yeah, we get really close.
[00:05:37.286 --> 00:05:38.647]  It's a civil matter.
[00:05:40.068 --> 00:05:48.074]   Since they got all this access to his stuff, and it's If he's not there, what can we go find?
[00:05:49.134 --> 00:05:50.115]  And the goal with him was what?
[00:05:50.155 --> 00:05:51.035]  Just to bankrupt him?
[00:05:51.395 --> 00:05:52.376]  Uh, pretty much.
[00:05:52.416 --> 00:05:54.917]  There's nothing federally, federal law, we can do.
[00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:59.139]  But civilly, we just go at him that way.
[00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.000]  Chop his legs off.
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.900]  Is he still out there?
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.440]  Yeah.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.241]  He's still chirping?
[00:06:03.361 --> 00:06:03.841]  He can chirp.
[00:06:04.241 --> 00:06:05.702]  Are you still watching him?
[00:06:05.902 --> 00:06:06.542]  Yeah.
[00:06:06.562 --> 00:06:06.882]  Why?
[00:06:07.102 --> 00:06:08.103]  I did what we wanted.
[00:06:09.283 --> 00:06:09.764]  Which was what?
[00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.851]  He took his money away.
[00:06:12.031 --> 00:06:12.171]  Oh.
[00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:18.499]  But you do have the option for a civil case, which is a pretty good case.
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.800]  Nice.
[00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:30.878]   Now before we get into the newest revelations that we just showed you a piece of, it's
[00:06:30.878 --> 00:06:36.519]   important to go back and do a quick summary of what actually happened to InfoWars and
[00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:41.759]   how the Deep State used the Sandy Hook narrative to create a false strawman of myself and my
[00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:47.639]   organization so they could then sell the idea of destroying it to the public to then set
[00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.439]  the president to destroy anyone else they want to target.
[00:06:50.819 --> 00:07:01.184]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[00:07:02.424 --> 00:07:07.426]  He even said, and this really just is so disgusting.
[00:07:08.587 --> 00:07:13.389]  He even said the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors.
[00:07:14.406 --> 00:07:16.887]  And no one was actually killed there.
[00:07:17.007 --> 00:07:25.572]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[00:07:26.692 --> 00:07:28.953]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[00:07:29.434 --> 00:07:34.416]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing.
[00:07:34.516 --> 00:07:35.837]  I will not let you down.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:52.785]  A few months before the election in 2016, Hillary Clinton and her opposition research decided to target then candidate Trump by claiming that I was his brain and that I was directing his campaign, which was not true.
[00:07:53.786 --> 00:08:03.759]  Then they misrepresented what I had said and what I had done in the past and claimed that I'd done all these terrible things so they could then try to attach that to Trump.
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:09.006]  And now we know that huge PR firms were involved.
[00:08:09.426 --> 00:08:19.077]  Taking things I've said out of context, exaggerating them, lying about them, and then running thousands of news articles and hundreds of national TV programs.
[00:08:19.197 --> 00:08:23.682]  Late Night Comedy, PBS, CNN, ABC News, NBC.
[00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:29.580]   There was literally not one news channel, national or local or even international, that
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:36.500]   did not run with the story in 2016 and 2017 every day that I was sending people to Sandy
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.581]   Hook family's homes, that I was sending people to urinate on graves.
[00:08:40.581 --> 00:08:41.981]  Never any proof of that.
[00:08:41.981 --> 00:08:45.081]  Never any proof of anybody urinating on graves.
[00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:50.260]   And that I was doing all this somehow in the direction of Trump, when I hadn't even talked
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:55.662]   about Sandy Hook for years and years and years before they started this disinformation PR
[00:08:55.662 --> 00:08:56.221]  campaign.
[00:08:56.716 --> 00:09:01.179]  And what's amazing now is the PR firms themselves are bragging how they did this.
[00:09:01.939 --> 00:09:17.391]   Do you have any people being paid by the CIA who are contributing To a major circulation, American Journal.
[00:09:18.071 --> 00:09:22.493]  We do have people who submit pieces to American Journal.
[00:09:22.653 --> 00:09:36.301]  Do you have any people paid by the CIA who are working for television networks?
[00:09:39.255 --> 00:09:45.880]  This, I think, gets into the kind of getting into the details, Mr. Chairman, that I'd like to get into an executive session.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.402]  One of my jobs was that of analyst.
[00:09:49.062 --> 00:10:00.010]  I also was an interrogator and, indeed, briefed the press when we, the CIA, wanted to circulate disinformation on a particular issue.
[00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.572]  Disinformation is not necessarily a lie.
[00:10:03.953 --> 00:10:05.194]  It may be a half-truth.
[00:10:06.094 --> 00:10:07.775]  And we would pick out a journalist.
[00:10:07.855 --> 00:10:13.639]  I would go do the briefing and hope that he would put the information in print.
[00:10:14.119 --> 00:10:34.712]  At any rate, this analysis that we made of the CIA's media operations disclosed, among other things, that they deliver, through CIA couriers, ready-to-print or ready-to-broadcast news, and I put that in inverted commas, which is used by the media.
[00:10:36.195 --> 00:10:38.676]  And this is created by the CIA.
[00:10:39.176 --> 00:10:43.818]  At the same time, that capability at any time could be turned around on the American people.
[00:10:45.418 --> 00:10:50.660]  And no American would have any privacy left such as the capability to monitor everything.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.400]  Telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn't matter.
[00:10:54.701 --> 00:11:01.443]  There would be no place to hide if this government ever became a tyranny.
[00:11:02.423 --> 00:11:05.044]  If a dictator ever took charge in this country.
[00:11:06.089 --> 00:11:16.057]  The technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny.
[00:11:16.617 --> 00:11:18.617]  Who would be like a big influence that you're...
[00:11:18.617 --> 00:11:20.617]  Influencer that you're after?
[00:11:20.617 --> 00:11:22.617]  You're... like a...
[00:11:22.617 --> 00:11:24.617]  I don't know, like a...
[00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:26.617]  I don't even know these names.
[00:11:26.248 --> 00:11:30.990]  Like a Fox News person, or like a Tucker Carlson, or like... Oh, I'm sure he's one.
[00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.011]  That's right.
[00:11:32.031 --> 00:11:33.631]  You always want the biggest and loudest.
[00:11:34.432 --> 00:11:35.452]  Like that, what was his name?
[00:11:35.472 --> 00:11:39.634]  The one that said, uh... The Sandy Hook didn't happen.
[00:11:39.774 --> 00:11:40.294]  Alex Jones.
[00:11:40.354 --> 00:11:40.714]  Yeah.
[00:11:40.774 --> 00:11:42.235]  So, we were after him.
[00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:43.215]  You are?
[00:11:43.515 --> 00:11:44.176]  Are you still after him?
[00:11:44.796 --> 00:11:44.976]  Yeah.
[00:11:45.016 --> 00:11:45.176]  Why?
[00:11:45.236 --> 00:11:46.016]  Because he's broke.
[00:11:46.357 --> 00:11:47.897]  He got found guilty.
[00:11:48.477 --> 00:11:49.638]  And had to pay like a hundred million dollars.
[00:11:50.618 --> 00:11:51.679]  So why were you after him?
[00:11:52.219 --> 00:11:52.879]  We're not in it anymore.
[00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:54.280]  Just to get the money for him?
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:54.540]  Yeah.
[00:11:56.092 --> 00:11:57.213]  Was that court case used?
[00:11:57.774 --> 00:11:58.374]  Was that a CIA case?
[00:11:58.394 --> 00:11:58.875]  It sure was.
[00:11:59.075 --> 00:12:00.176]  That was the agency there?
[00:12:00.577 --> 00:12:02.499]  Well, actually it was a defamation case.
[00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:04.961]  So it's a civil, not government case.
[00:12:06.042 --> 00:12:11.088]  But we were looking at all of the spoilers, comments, calling like, who's up in this?
[00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:11.488]  Right?
[00:12:12.489 --> 00:12:18.075]  So, even though it's technically not our, well not the agency definitely, but the Bureau for instance.
[00:12:19.178 --> 00:12:19.999]  Yeah, that's not our purview.
[00:12:20.059 --> 00:12:22.041]  It's a civil matter.
[00:12:22.922 --> 00:12:31.572]  But, since they got all this access to his stuff, and it's there, what can we go find?
[00:12:32.693 --> 00:12:33.935]  And did you find anything?
[00:12:33.995 --> 00:12:35.516]  I can't tell you anything.
[00:12:36.077 --> 00:12:38.199]  So in a quick summation, here's how it works.
[00:12:39.195 --> 00:12:40.496]  Trump is winning in the polls.
[00:12:41.316 --> 00:12:43.297]  Nothing they were doing against him was working.
[00:12:43.917 --> 00:12:50.920]  So they go in, focus on Alex Jones, lie about what I've said and done, claim I'm attacking families of dead children.
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:13:13.079]  Put it all over the news, and then claim that Trump is directing it, and then file lawsuits against me, get all the discovery, find no evidence of what they were claiming, and then they had judges in Austin, Texas and in Connecticut rule that I was defaulted, so I was already guilty.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:27.146]  Then they had show trials on the damages I would pay but told the juries that I was guilty and instructed my lawyers that I couldn't say I was innocent and couldn't put on a defense because I'd already been found guilty.
[00:13:27.787 --> 00:13:34.670]  But they still wanted to have a show trial because Americans still in the back of their mind believe that you're supposed to get a trial in America.
[00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:49.443]  Once they'd won the predetermined show trials, the lawyers in Connecticut and Texas, all connected to the Democratic Party at the highest levels, openly came out and said, we don't want his money, the supposed billions I had that was totally made up.
[00:13:49.863 --> 00:13:53.407]  No, our mission is to take him off the air.
[00:13:53.867 --> 00:13:55.469]  Our mission is to silence him.
[00:13:56.369 --> 00:14:05.057]   I ask that with your verdict, you not only Take Alex Jones' platform that he talks about away.
[00:14:05.877 --> 00:14:10.121]  I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild the platform.
[00:14:10.621 --> 00:14:11.642]  That's what matters.
[00:14:13.744 --> 00:14:23.912]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he can't do it again.
[00:14:25.553 --> 00:14:26.574]  That is punishment.
[00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:28.636]  That is deterrence.
[00:14:30.416 --> 00:14:35.298]  I hope that we never see someone like him again.
[00:14:37.139 --> 00:14:39.740]  I hope that with your verdict he can go away.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:51.544]  Alex Jones is patient zero for our society's inability to speak without lies.
[00:14:53.185 --> 00:14:53.785]  I believe it.
[00:14:55.966 --> 00:15:02.754]   When it comes to stopping Alex Jones, that would be the most important work that you One minute.
[00:15:03.975 --> 00:15:04.596]  Alex Jones.
[00:15:05.356 --> 00:15:08.179]  And the question is going to be, where is Alex Jones when that happens?
[00:15:10.782 --> 00:15:11.843]  Is he in the studio?
[00:15:12.243 --> 00:15:19.243]  Get ready to bounce, or will you stop it?
[00:15:19.243 --> 00:15:22.363]   But the important part of that is we're not going to be spinning in two years going up
[00:15:22.363 --> 00:15:23.762]  to Texas Supreme Court or whatever.
[00:15:23.749 --> 00:15:25.009]  Nobody's going to waste their money doing that.
[00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:26.570]  We're going to this bankruptcy court.
[00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.352]  And those claims are going to have to get valued and resolved in that bankruptcy estate.
[00:15:30.432 --> 00:15:37.635]  And when we have a litigable basis to potentially wrap this case up for years and then ultimately collect our entire punitive damage argument?
[00:15:38.275 --> 00:15:41.517]  Yeah, there's going to be a resolution made on to what these claims are valued at.
[00:15:41.877 --> 00:15:47.640]  And that's also going to have to take into account what the Lafferty claims are valued at, and the Posner claims are valued at, and the Fontaine claims are valued at.
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:57.805]  And that is why I've been saying that what this is heading towards is there's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of InfoWars and the bankruptcy estate.
[00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:01.847]  And over the course of that process, that could get very, very dangerous for Mr. Jones.
[00:16:02.964 --> 00:16:05.546]  But we will be at it as long as it takes.
[00:16:06.267 --> 00:16:16.455]  And if you're out there right now and you're one of Alex Jones' audience members, and you're considering giving him money, I just want you to know that based on the jury's verdict today, it's not a very good bet.
[00:16:17.616 --> 00:16:25.123]  And to go back to what Robbie Parker said, all Alex Jones does is take from you, exploit you, lie to you.
[00:16:26.374 --> 00:16:26.834]  Take Mr. Jones out!
[00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:29.854]  your fears and your anxieties and your mistrust.
[00:16:29.854 --> 00:16:33.413]  And the only person that benefits in that equation is him.
[00:16:33.413 --> 00:16:35.092]  Well that stops.
[00:16:35.092 --> 00:16:38.493]   That's stopping today thanks to the courage of these families.
[00:16:38.493 --> 00:16:39.493]  Thank you very much.
[00:16:39.493 --> 00:16:41.614]  Thanks everybody.
[00:16:41.614 --> 00:16:43.614]  Take Mr. Jones out.
[00:16:43.614 --> 00:16:46.492]  Don't ever let him do it again.
[00:16:46.492 --> 00:16:47.413]  But what did I do?
[00:16:47.993 --> 00:16:49.856]  They never put on any evidence I did anything.
[00:16:50.637 --> 00:16:54.402]  I never even said the names of any of the parents except one person.
[00:16:55.263 --> 00:17:05.796]   Now let's get in to the major evidence outside of the Undercover videos coming out that prove it and that are triggering congressional investigations.
[00:17:06.236 --> 00:17:11.038]  Let's look at the open evidence of the FBI being involved in my targeting from day one.
[00:17:11.658 --> 00:17:13.898]  First, let's look at William Aldenberg.
[00:17:13.918 --> 00:17:18.320]  He was already a senior FBI agent in Connecticut when Sandy Hook happened.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.140]  He reportedly responded to the tragedy.
[00:17:21.881 --> 00:17:30.223]  William Aldenberg was already a senior agent when Sandy Hook happened, but shortly after he was made the head FBI agent lawyer in the state of Connecticut.
[00:17:31.035 --> 00:17:34.138]  In January, did you assume a new position?
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:47.790]  I was put into a position they call Chief Division Counsel, which is the head attorney for that FBI division.
[00:17:47.851 --> 00:17:51.874]  You give legal counsel to the leadership of the division.
[00:17:52.195 --> 00:17:56.519]  I was put in that position temporarily, and then about a month later, I was appointed to that position.
[00:17:57.614 --> 00:18:02.037]  So you were the top lawyer providing advice to the FBI in Connecticut?
[00:18:03.077 --> 00:18:03.998]  In-house, yes sir.
[00:18:04.058 --> 00:18:04.338]  In-house?
[00:18:04.398 --> 00:18:04.798]  Yes sir.
[00:18:05.278 --> 00:18:12.202]  The first time I ever heard of William Aldenburg was when I was sued in Connecticut for questioning Sandy Hook.
[00:18:13.203 --> 00:18:17.445]  And Mr. Aldenburg was actually asked on the stand, has Mr. Jones ever said your name?
[00:18:17.505 --> 00:18:19.486]  Has his crew ever talked about you?
[00:18:19.706 --> 00:18:20.627]  Have you ever been on his website?
[00:18:21.047 --> 00:18:21.768]  And he said no.
[00:18:22.288 --> 00:18:23.889]  How many times did Jones call you?
[00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:26.297]  He didn't call me, sir.
[00:18:27.859 --> 00:18:31.723]  Did you ever see this photograph 289 on InfoWars?
[00:18:33.765 --> 00:18:34.426]  I didn't, no sir.
[00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:37.309]  Do you know whether he ever talked about you on InfoWars?
[00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:38.511]  I don't, I don't know.
[00:18:39.693 --> 00:18:54.745]  And here he is admitting that he went to the Costco firm, and that they developed this system, and that they filed this lawsuit, and that they came after me, and I've never even said his name, never even talked about him, didn't even know who he was.
[00:18:55.366 --> 00:18:57.968]  How can something like this happen in America?
[00:18:58.268 --> 00:19:05.494]  How can we be denied a real trial where we're innocent until proven guilty, not guilty until proven how guilty?
[00:19:05.888 --> 00:19:09.511]  When's the first time you watched a video of Mr. Helbig on Mr. Jones' show?
[00:19:10.412 --> 00:19:15.456]  I would be guessing, sir, I would bet I would say approximately like 2016.
[00:19:15.916 --> 00:19:17.097]  Where were you when you saw that?
[00:19:17.298 --> 00:19:20.180]  I was sitting in my office on the second floor at FBI New Haven.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.962]  You didn't file a suit at that point in 2016?
[00:19:23.443 --> 00:19:25.284]  No, at that point I couldn't get anybody to help me.
[00:19:26.205 --> 00:19:26.726]  You were looking?
[00:19:27.746 --> 00:19:35.512]   I was, by then I was pretty certain by 2016 I had contacted The Agents Association.
[00:19:35.532 --> 00:19:36.572]  I've been looking for people.
[00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:38.133]  I've been asking the U.S.
[00:19:38.193 --> 00:19:39.314]  Attorney's Office to help me.
[00:19:39.354 --> 00:19:42.195]  I've been asking the FBI New Haven to help me.
[00:19:42.215 --> 00:19:43.416]  So yes, I was looking for help.
[00:19:43.816 --> 00:19:49.259]  And then finally, you know, the only person to ever even listen was Mr. Koskoff.
[00:19:51.563 --> 00:19:57.563]   He's, he, you know, he was gentleman and gracious enough to listen to me and that's why we're here.
[00:19:57.563 --> 00:19:58.362]  Is there going to be a waiver?
[00:19:58.362 --> 00:20:06.123]   It's no mistake that the FBI consigliere, the head legal officer for the FBI in Connecticut,
[00:20:06.123 --> 00:20:11.003]   went to the Koskoff law firm, which itself is heavily connected to the Democratic Party,
[00:20:11.003 --> 00:20:13.323]  Senator Blumenthal, and others.
[00:20:13.457 --> 00:20:21.325]  Let's look now at Chris Maddy, a former federal prosecutor whose specialty is throwing Republicans in prison.
[00:20:21.845 --> 00:20:27.671]  He helped quarterback the operation for putting the governor of Connecticut, a Republican, in prison.
[00:20:28.171 --> 00:20:38.877]  Then, of course, we've got Matt Blumenthal, the son of the stolen Valor father, Senator Blumenthal, who, in the depositions, was there interrogating me.
[00:20:39.578 --> 00:20:48.523]  And then, of course, you've got Josh Koskoff, the generational heir to the most powerful ambulance-chasing law firm on the East Coast.
[00:20:49.002 --> 00:20:54.482]   They're now doing the same thing in Canada with Pierre Polliev, who is leading by massive
[00:20:54.482 --> 00:20:58.601]   numbers against Trudeau in the race to be the leader of Canada right now, claiming that
[00:20:58.601 --> 00:21:02.841]   secretly he gets talking points from me and that I'm running the Conservative Party in
[00:21:02.841 --> 00:21:03.841]  Canada.
[00:21:03.841 --> 00:21:09.782]   They're running the exact same playbook they ran in 2016 against Trump against the Conservatives
[00:21:09.782 --> 00:21:10.782]  in Canada.
[00:21:10.782 --> 00:21:13.841]  History is repeating itself again.
[00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:18.002]   Take a flamboyant individual like Alex Jones, take what he said out of context, totally
[00:21:18.002 --> 00:21:23.402]   make stuff up, rig court trials against him, and then set the precedent to take down whoever
[00:21:23.402 --> 00:21:25.721]  you want, whenever you want, however you want.
[00:21:25.756 --> 00:21:31.432]   And I knew The Deep State was running this going back six, seven years ago because I wasn't that important.
[00:21:32.153 --> 00:21:35.915]  Thousands of news articles, hundreds of national TV programs lying about me.
[00:21:36.736 --> 00:21:43.321]  I knew they were setting the precedent to deplatform me, to use lawfare to try to shut us down, to set the precedent for others.
[00:21:43.361 --> 00:21:44.342]  That was obvious.
[00:21:44.382 --> 00:21:48.325]  This was a level of propaganda you only see before the U.S.
[00:21:48.405 --> 00:21:49.486]  invades a country.
[00:21:50.387 --> 00:21:51.668]  But they were invading a country.
[00:21:51.708 --> 00:21:53.209]  They were invading America.
[00:21:53.449 --> 00:22:05.399]  They were getting ready to list all of their opposition, all Trump supporters as terrorists, as extremists, as white supremacists that must be censored, that must be surveilled, that must be silenced.
[00:22:05.659 --> 00:22:07.060]  And that's why this is so important.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:15.988]   But if you can demonize an Alex Jones, And then carry out these operations against him and others don't defend you because they're scared they're going to be labeled.
[00:22:16.548 --> 00:22:19.611]  Now the first domino has fallen and no one is safe.
[00:22:20.171 --> 00:22:35.965]  But the good news is Congress and governors and attorney generals and others across the country are recognizing how serious this is and are seeing the same lawfare tactics being used against Trump and other populists and are beginning to organize against it.
[00:22:36.425 --> 00:22:40.888]  So, do you think that members of Congress get spied on through these loopholes?
[00:22:40.707 --> 00:22:44.707]   and more information is imminently set to come out very, very soon.
[00:22:44.707 --> 00:22:48.707]   So, do you think that members of Congress get spied on through these loopholes?
[00:22:48.707 --> 00:22:50.707]  Yes. A hundred percent.
[00:22:50.595 --> 00:22:55.560]  In fact, I'm quite confident in some capacity that I'm sure I'm on the list.
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:23:08.494]  I think that the administration has made it very evident that they believe that if you are Christian, if you are Republican, if you're conservative, if you say the words, shall not be infringed, if you believe in the constitution, that you're likely a domestic terrorist.
[00:23:09.008 --> 00:23:12.270]  This is all about intimidating the people of America.
[00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:14.270]  This is all about scaring people.
[00:23:14.511 --> 00:23:22.094]  When they won their $1.5 billion dollar rigged judgment in Connecticut, the lawyers came out and said, that's not enough.
[00:23:22.214 --> 00:23:23.935]  We want $2.75 trillion.
[00:23:23.975 --> 00:23:25.335]  That's the GDP of India.
[00:23:28.817 --> 00:23:32.281]  And then they lie and say, Jones won't pay his debt to the families.
[00:23:32.321 --> 00:23:33.703]  He won't pay his 1.5 billion.
[00:23:34.264 --> 00:23:37.547]  I'm negative millions of dollars that I owe.
[00:23:38.228 --> 00:23:39.710]  I've been in bankruptcy for two years.
[00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:41.432]  They knew all this back at the time.
[00:23:41.832 --> 00:23:48.741]  But again, they lied about it and claimed I had hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars and that I made it off these people?
[00:23:49.773 --> 00:23:55.776]  When all they entered into evidence from all these years of me talking about Sandy Hook was 22 minutes.
[00:23:56.336 --> 00:23:58.137]  This is an un-American fraud.
[00:23:58.477 --> 00:23:59.778]  It's an un-American lie.
[00:24:00.198 --> 00:24:05.101]  And as Mark Twain said, a lie goes halfway around the world before the truth puts its pants on.
[00:24:05.621 --> 00:24:08.823]  But in the end, the truth almost always comes out on top.
[00:24:09.243 --> 00:24:10.964]  And it's happening right now.
[00:24:11.364 --> 00:24:13.505]  This is a lot bigger than vindicating Alex Jones.
[00:24:14.025 --> 00:24:14.946]  Yes, I was targeted.
[00:24:15.466 --> 00:24:16.507]  Yes, I was set up.
[00:24:17.367 --> 00:24:20.329]  But again, I was being set up because they're setting you up.
[00:24:20.409 --> 00:24:27.855]  They are casting you, like it's a Hollywood movie, because you're a populist, or a conservative, or a Christian, or a capitalist, as an evil, bad person.
[00:24:28.636 --> 00:24:40.705]  The deep state knows it's unpopular, and it's declared war on not just the people of America, but free, independent people around the world, from the Netherlands, to Sri Lanka, to Ireland, to Canada, to the U.S.
[00:24:40.905 --> 00:24:42.327]  They're shutting down farms.
[00:24:43.007 --> 00:24:44.850]  They're shutting down dairies.
[00:24:45.131 --> 00:24:46.914]  They're going after small businesses.
[00:24:47.195 --> 00:24:49.258]  They're waging economic war against us.
[00:24:49.278 --> 00:24:51.182]  They're cutting off our pipelines.
[00:24:51.442 --> 00:24:53.045]  They're devaluing our currency.
[00:24:53.646 --> 00:24:56.050]  Our cities are falling apart.
[00:24:57.366 --> 00:25:07.311]  And the same globalists that say I'm the ultimate demon, that I'm the bad guy, are the ones that lied about WMDs in Iraq, are the ones that have been caught involved in all these incredible crimes.
[00:25:07.791 --> 00:25:15.154]  Not one person on the Jeffrey Epstein pedophile list has been indicted or arrested, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:16.195 --> 00:25:21.237]  And that very same corrupt establishment can point its finger at me and say Alex Jones is the bad guy.
[00:25:21.998 --> 00:25:26.320]  Most people that buy this propaganda actually think I killed the kids.
[00:25:27.179 --> 00:25:28.440]  They don't even know it was Adam Lanza.
[00:25:29.121 --> 00:25:38.789]  When I do get confronted by people that buy into the HBO documentaries and the rest of it, they walk up to me and say, how dare you do what you did to those kids?
[00:25:38.929 --> 00:25:45.655]  I had a woman just three days ago walk up to me and say, how dare you urinate on their graves?
[00:25:45.695 --> 00:25:47.477]  And I looked at her and I said, are you crazy, lady?
[00:25:48.037 --> 00:25:50.139]  Did you ever see any proof of anybody urinating on a grave?
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.702]  And she just said, F you and your family and walked off.
[00:25:53.322 --> 00:25:54.003]  But here's the good news.
[00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:59.693]  For every time that happens, I shake thousands of hands and get people's support.
[00:26:00.053 --> 00:26:02.535]  And the majority of people see through this garbage.
[00:26:02.555 --> 00:26:08.959]  But for those that are brainwashed, it's so incredibly sad to see that they've fallen under the control of this.
[00:26:09.479 --> 00:26:13.281]  So I'm going to end this with a clip of Madeleine Albright on 60 Minutes.
[00:26:14.182 --> 00:26:24.689]  Madeleine Albright, as the Secretary of State under the Clinton administration, tripled the sanctions on Iraq, a mainly desert country that was importing 80% of its food and medicine, or more.
[00:26:25.731 --> 00:26:31.574]  When she tripled the sanctions, they were already crippling before that, it killed overall 3 million people.
[00:26:31.794 --> 00:26:36.636]  But the time she was asked about it, partway on the sanctions, it had killed a million people, half of them children.
[00:26:38.477 --> 00:26:40.958]  We have heard that a half a million children have died.
[00:26:41.798 --> 00:26:46.180]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[00:26:46.941 --> 00:26:50.122]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[00:26:51.215 --> 00:26:55.878]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.
[00:26:56.198 --> 00:26:59.301]  So this woman says, I'll do it again.
[00:26:59.701 --> 00:27:07.867]  I'll kill millions of people with starvation and lack of medical care, but she's a woman with a brooch and she's in charge like Barbie, so it's okay.
[00:27:08.647 --> 00:27:11.429]  She's a good person, lauded and loved.
[00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:16.533]  Like Victoria Nuland trying to start World War III in Ukraine, but Alex Jones.
[00:27:17.489 --> 00:27:28.293]  that saw the internet questioning a mass shooting and covered it a few times and had a debate with both sides once why he made all his money on it and he lives it and it's his whole world.
[00:27:28.513 --> 00:27:50.535]   No, the truth is PR firms from the Democratic Party with law firms directed by the FBI with CIA Operation Mockingbird in the media, it's all out now, and this congressional hearing's coming, came in, created this straw man of myself, had rigged trials, tried to shut me down, To set the precedent to intimidate and scare everybody else, and it's totally un-American.
[00:27:50.936 --> 00:28:03.665]  And the truth is, the foundations and the charities in and around gun control, on my name, by attaching themselves to me, in the last six, seven years, have raised hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:28:04.165 --> 00:28:06.747]  They're the ones that make money off Sandy Hook.
[00:28:07.047 --> 00:28:11.771]  They're the ones that got 70-plus million from Remington, the oldest gun manufacturer in America, and bankrupted it.
[00:28:12.071 --> 00:28:21.004]   They're the ones, 11 years later, That literally have built their entire house on these sad dead children who I'm so sorry are dead and I do believe died.
[00:28:21.725 --> 00:28:22.865]  And I'm not the one.
[00:28:23.006 --> 00:28:24.186]  I'm not Mr. Sandy Hook.
[00:28:24.587 --> 00:28:25.587]  I'm not Adam Lanza.
[00:28:25.788 --> 00:28:28.990]  I didn't kill the kids and I didn't do 99% of the things they said I did.
[00:28:31.667 --> 00:28:32.427]  God bless you all.
[00:28:32.507 --> 00:28:34.708]  Major action coming soon.
[00:28:34.768 --> 00:28:35.929]  I'm not a litigious person.
[00:28:36.109 --> 00:28:40.891]  I don't want to have to take on the CIA and the FBI, but we need new Senator Frank Church type hearings.
[00:28:41.571 --> 00:28:46.934]  We're talking to some of the top law firms in the country right now that are very, very interested and want to take action.
[00:28:47.434 --> 00:28:50.996]  And I'm going to do this to draw this lie out in the open further.
[00:28:51.656 --> 00:28:55.417]  So with Alex Jones, you were watching him long before anything ended up happening.
[00:28:55.236 --> 00:29:00.596]   to terrorize and intimidate the American people that would make the KGB blush.
[00:29:00.596 --> 00:29:01.596]  So thank you for your support.
[00:29:01.596 --> 00:29:06.075]   We'll keep fighting as long as we can at InfoWars.com and Band.Video as well as Real Alex Jones
[00:29:06.075 --> 00:29:19.636]  on the Mighty X platform.
[00:29:19.705 --> 00:29:21.086]  Just to bankrupt him?
[00:29:21.307 --> 00:29:21.947]  Oh, pretty much.
[00:29:22.047 --> 00:29:23.909]  And we let the families do it.
[00:29:23.949 --> 00:29:24.409]  What?
[00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:26.071]  We let the families do it.
[00:29:26.391 --> 00:29:28.393]  Were they encouraged to do that by the Bureau?
[00:29:28.413 --> 00:29:29.494]  Like nudged?
[00:29:29.514 --> 00:29:31.856]  We don't encourage people.
[00:29:31.896 --> 00:29:36.980]  We just say there's no federal statute being broken.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.344]  But you do have the option for a civil case.
[00:29:41.444 --> 00:29:42.785]  It's a pretty good case.
[00:29:43.926 --> 00:29:46.167]  That's our opinion.
[00:29:46.247 --> 00:29:48.348]  Oh, that makes so much sense.
[00:29:48.368 --> 00:29:50.569]  I have a cousin who's a lawyer.
[00:29:50.609 --> 00:29:53.951]  So that's a lot of these cases, they're kind of encouraged by the FBI?
[00:29:53.991 --> 00:30:01.294]  Yeah, like, there's even federal law we can do, but civilly, just go at them that way.
[00:30:01.374 --> 00:30:03.755]  And they did?
[00:30:04.415 --> 00:30:05.376]  So the FBI was happy?
[00:30:05.856 --> 00:30:08.577]  They didn't care, we were like, awww.
[00:30:09.658 --> 00:30:11.639]  Basically, the citizens did your job.
[00:30:11.699 --> 00:30:11.839]  Yeah.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.681]  So you can encourage a civil lawsuit.
[00:30:14.721 --> 00:30:16.561]  Not encourage.
[00:30:16.721 --> 00:30:17.222]  Educate.
[00:30:17.442 --> 00:30:18.222]  Educate.
[00:30:20.723 --> 00:30:26.485]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:30:27.185 --> 00:30:27.765]  InfoWars.com.
[00:30:31.223 --> 00:30:35.786]  We predicted, Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, so many others, everything that's now come to pass.
[00:30:35.886 --> 00:30:37.727]  We're actually on the mark.
[00:30:38.247 --> 00:30:39.768]  We actually want a civilization.
[00:30:39.868 --> 00:30:40.908]  We want prosperity.
[00:30:41.629 --> 00:30:42.409]  I'm liking it too.
[00:30:42.609 --> 00:30:44.150]  I'm selling for free.
[00:30:44.611 --> 00:30:48.533]  I'm giving away ice cold water with lemon in it in the Sahara Desert.
[00:30:49.249 --> 00:30:51.870]  And the left's selling sand in the Sahara Desert.
[00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:59.211]  They're selling things that go against, you'll have nothing, you'll eat bugs, you'll drink sewage water, your families are horrible.
[00:30:59.231 --> 00:31:02.932]  You said earlier, we offer abortion and cutting your son's penis off.
[00:31:03.352 --> 00:31:04.453]  It's like, it's Hellraiser.
[00:31:04.973 --> 00:31:08.094]  And when you just sit back and go, wait, this can't be real.
[00:31:08.474 --> 00:31:10.834]  Klaus Schwab is promoting stuff that sounds like Hellraiser.
[00:31:11.154 --> 00:31:12.795]  Well, so is Hitler, so is Stalin.
[00:31:13.195 --> 00:31:17.916]  And we realize that this is an evil manifestation that crops up in our species.
[00:31:18.556 --> 00:31:19.816]  A bad people want power.
[00:31:20.136 --> 00:31:26.998]  The problem is good people don't seek power because we're going to be left alone, hang out with our families, go fish, go hunt, go to dinner, go play golf.
[00:31:27.118 --> 00:31:27.738]  I'm the same way.
[00:31:28.118 --> 00:31:29.059]  But I'm sorry, folks.
[00:31:29.419 --> 00:31:35.220]  Good people can't sit there and say, I'm too good for this because we will be destroyed if we don't.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.561]  And that's what evil fears.
[00:31:36.621 --> 00:31:40.342]  So the good men and women are now standing up and we're super popular.
[00:31:40.562 --> 00:31:41.922]  Every popular talk shows.
[00:31:42.062 --> 00:31:45.946]  There's no one that's popular promoting the New World Order.
[00:31:46.607 --> 00:31:53.153]  Look at the positiveness of how humans desire, like a man in the desert wants water, freedom.
[00:31:53.694 --> 00:31:57.057]  And all we're doing is promoting the natural programming that works.
[00:31:57.598 --> 00:31:58.439]  And so it's easy.
[00:31:58.539 --> 00:31:59.180]  We're the winners.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.121]  We're the victors.
[00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:00.981]  We're not the cancer.
[00:32:01.222 --> 00:32:02.863]  We're following the program God gave us.
[00:32:03.644 --> 00:32:08.407]  That is like oxygen and we have to just declare the enemy cancer and just say we're done.
[00:32:08.607 --> 00:32:09.087]  Shun them.
[00:32:09.747 --> 00:32:10.828]  Don't engage in violence.
[00:32:10.848 --> 00:32:15.471]  They want that and just give them no support and the maximum back the truth and we will win.
[00:32:17.011 --> 00:32:17.092]  Wow.
[00:32:18.252 --> 00:32:20.333]  As I listen to you talk, I'm like, why?
[00:32:21.514 --> 00:32:24.776]  Why is Alex Jones getting cancelled?
[00:32:24.796 --> 00:32:25.796]  Well, you haven't been cancelled.
[00:32:26.117 --> 00:32:26.537]  Thank God.
[00:32:31.264 --> 00:32:37.327]  I know, as viewers and listeners, you've heard callers call in and talk about how X3 has changed their life.
[00:32:37.988 --> 00:32:41.589]  You've heard listeners talk about how incredible 10-hour clean energy turbo force is.
[00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:44.571]  Well, both products are back in stock right now.
[00:32:44.891 --> 00:32:54.997]   In fact, X3 has been sold out for more than six months, but despite that, it is 40% off, because I want the people Who have never tried the product to try it.
[00:32:55.137 --> 00:32:58.979]  Our regular listeners and the folks that have already tried it are chomping at the bit to get it.
[00:32:59.259 --> 00:33:00.140]  We appreciate them.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:04.002]  But less than 1% of you ever buy a product at importwarsware.com.
[00:33:04.522 --> 00:33:05.003]  Go there.
[00:33:05.203 --> 00:33:06.524]  Try X3.
[00:33:06.864 --> 00:33:10.846]  Get the missing link that's essential to all electrochemical activity in your body.
[00:33:11.187 --> 00:33:14.489]  This is the purest, highest quality triiodine out there.
[00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:18.771]  You owe it to yourself to get a bottle and experience it for yourself.
[00:33:18.831 --> 00:33:20.112]  Takes a few weeks to kick in.
[00:33:20.612 --> 00:33:24.971]  average get x3 while you're at it.
