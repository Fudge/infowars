[00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.689]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and support the Infowars.
[00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:30.929]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:32.710]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.969]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWar and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.329]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.490]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.620]  We are unified by our spirit that God made and our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.379]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of intervention.
[00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.299]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.519]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:42.159]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.159]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.879]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good, it's crazy.
[00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:56.219]  The real war's here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the New World Order and BlackRock.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.680]  AlexJones.network is tomorrow's news today.
[00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.819]  Infowars can be shut down in just a few weeks.
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.520]  But regardless, the fight continues at AJNLive on X, the Alex Jones Network.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.419]  If the globalists think they're going to shut us down, we've got another thing coming.
[00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:27.879]  The Second American Revolution continues on at AJNLive.
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.319]  Follow me there now for news updates and critical intel as we restore our republic.
[00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.430]  It is Thursday, November 7th, 2024.
[00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:47.449]  I am your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the Embattled Studios in Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.430]  Thank you so much for joining us today, my friends.
[00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:07.599]  I cannot stress enough to all of you That we have a real chance, not just at restoring our republic and fully retaking it from the grasp of the kleptocratic New World Order globalist death cult.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:16.759]  We are within striking distance of completely destroying and stopping the New World Order global government project.
[00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.020]  They are admitting...
[00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.610]  In their own publications, and I don't just believe them.
[00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.289]  I can see it.
[00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.430]  I can know it before they said it.
[00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.030]  I'm saying it for 30 years.
[00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:36.990]  That what they're pushing is so evil, so draconian, so out of control, so destructive, so anti-human, that it has a leg up on us because it's so horrible.
[00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.129]  People just can't interface with this level of evil.
[00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.250]  They just can't admit it to themselves.
[00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:47.849]  But if you do admit it and actually research their own admissions and their own plans, then they're so arrogant it's all laid out there.
[00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:52.349]  Then humanity will wake up and fully reject it.
[00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.210]  And so, yesterday I'd had like three hours sleep, did a pretty good job, but I was shell-shocked by the victory.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.719]  I got eight hours sleep last night.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.319]  Feel great.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.060]  Totally energized.
[00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:06.120]  And I'm crystal clear on what's going on and what's unfolding.
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.599]  And just devastating victory.
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.719]  Congratulations, everyone.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.939]  We overpowered the deep state.
[00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.259]  They tried to steal it.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.039]  Massive fraud.
[00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:19.720]  But as I told you from the numbers, a massive landslide could override them and then would just look like a moderate victory.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.439]  But he did win the popular vote.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.740]  We won the popular vote and, of course, the Electoral College.
[00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.040]  So that's the first time for Trump doing that because of the fraud that was baked in the first time.
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.300]  He won the electoral but not the popular.
[00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:45.000]  And it looks like we're going to keep the House, though not with a big majority, but in a way that's better because then the patriots that are in there can control things to an even greater extent as long as there's not more defections to the Democrats.
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.279]  So We just had an unbelievable transmission today.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.000]  Special guest in the studio, your phone calls, the next spaces, and so much more.
[00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:01.089]  And, just to show how urgent everything is, InfoWars will be shut down on the 13th, next Wednesday.
[00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.069]  So, the planets are aligned.
[00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:04.430]  The Great Quickening is here.
[00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.149]  Stay with us.
[00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.790]  This is a live emergency post-Victory Thursday broadcast.
[00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.670]  Trump won.
[00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:13.990]  I'm about to break down what comes next.
[00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:20.029]  Must Watch Share, live edition of the most censored broadcast, The Tyrant's Fear in the World.
[00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:26.860]  And it is you, the listeners, the men and women in the arena, That have spread the word, prayed for the broadcast, and supported us.
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:34.879]  That have held us up there under unprecedented deep state attacks so that we can be on air during this most critical of times.
[00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:44.740]  The 76 days, and now we're only 74, to the inauguration of the 47th President of the United States.
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.639]  We overpowered the election fraud.
[00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:52.620]  We overpowered the psyops, the gaslighting, the propaganda, the brainwashing.
[00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:56.370]  And it was a massive victory.
[00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:58.850]  Trump supposedly got the same amount of votes he got.
[00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:03.879]  In 2016, Kamala Harris got $16 million less than Joe Biden.
[00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:05.540]  Do you believe any of that?
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:20.959]  Because the RNC got taken over by the Trumps, because we had the lawyers and the poll watchers, and I've talked to friends, family, and people I know around the country, there were just Trump poll watchers and lawyers everywhere, because you gave Trump billions of dollars in small donations,
[00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:35.680]  and it was a lot less than what the big corporations gave Kamala, because you stood up, because you took action, because you got off the bench, We just scored the biggest victory against the globalist New World Order's 80-year history.
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.779]  Their entire world government project is falling apart.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:55.500]  Klaus Schwab, Yuval Harari, the Financial Times of London, the Atlantic Monthly, the New Yorker magazine, all of the different globalist mouthpieces and organs are Are admitting they're in free fall.
[00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:00.160]  You look at the body language and statements by Jack Smith and the fake prosecutions of Trump that were dropped yesterday.
[00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:02.019]  Totally scared.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.759]  Leticia James can barely talk.
[00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:04.459]  Deer in the headlights.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.120]  Totally scared.
[00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:10.439]  They're all scared because, listen to me, they've committed massive crimes.
[00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:12.399]  They believe they were invincible.
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:29.060]  Mayorkas, literally a UN former official, an NGO official of the open border operations, Under this crime syndicate, smuggled over 25 million illegals in the country, millions of them children.
[00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:33.959]  In their own report, they released children, 325,000 and growing.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.540]  That's a Senate report two months ago, as you know.
[00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:38.300]  Many of which went into slave labor and sex slavery.
[00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:41.040]  Senate report with the names, the numbers, all of it.
[00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:45.180]  The Senate was given where many of the children disappeared to that they did track.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.620]  And that, of course, was then leaked to...
[00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:53.449]  The Muckraker team.
[00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.470]  And they're giving their information to Congress.
[00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.790]  So, just that alone.
[00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:06.569]  Trump, 70-something days out from getting his people in at DHS. And I can tell you he's getting a team and a task force ready.
[00:08:06.709 --> 00:08:08.290]  You heard General Flynn that's advising him yesterday.
[00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:14.930]  That interview, 20-plus million views on X. I reposted this morning to the top of Real Alex Jones.
[00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.269]  It's about five posts down.
[00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:17.449]  Go get it.
[00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:19.610]  Let's get it up to 100 million.
[00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:37.070]  Because it's a battle plan that if you go after the people that smuggle the kids, the NGOs that violated federal law, doesn't matter that Mayorkas waved a wand, it's still organized crime, human trafficking, Trump starts busting them,
[00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:45.710]  they flip, NGOs, then you're up to the non-profits, then you're up to Soros and the UN and the State Department.
[00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:53.750]  And their entire project, mass human trafficking, sex slavery, disappearing identities of children on purpose.
[00:08:53.909 --> 00:08:54.470]  They didn't lose them.
[00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.450]  They disappeared them.
[00:08:55.889 --> 00:09:00.309]  That brings down the entire global pedophile network.
[00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.110]  I'll show you the General Flynn interview I want.
[00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.470]  That was Wednesday morning interview at 2 a.m.
[00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.250]  with General Flynn.
[00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.190]  The one we want is at Real Alex Jones.
[00:09:14.889 --> 00:09:16.549]  And you go to Real Alex Jones.
[00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:17.190]  There it is.
[00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:25.259]  President Trump planning to launch federal task force that will target the giant human trafficking networks controlled by the Democrat slash UN system.
[00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:34.019]  And then below I wrote, if Trump executes this plan, it will bring down the entire global New World Order state.
[00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:37.320]  Because they use the human trafficking and sex slavery...
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:44.440]  That governments under NGO control carry out to then corrupt all the agencies.
[00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:48.360]  Remember the head of the Border Patrol three years ago said we now complete the smuggling process.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.240]  We don't want to do it.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:49.659]  It's illegal.
[00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:56.320]  And all the hundreds of whistleblowers that went public, senior, Border Patrol, ICE, you name it, to Congress saying stop this.
[00:09:56.539 --> 00:09:58.659]  They're ordering us to help them disappear kids.
[00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:03.340]  They get them on the planes and buses and vans, and then they disappear.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:18.840]  And then we've had investigators that come out on the ground all over the country, Florida, New York, everywhere, Illinois, Washington State, Minnesota, Colorado, Oklahoma, everywhere, where they're dumped out, in many cases no paperwork, as long as three months old,
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:19.960]  and disappeared.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.559]  And...
[00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.110]  You go after this.
[00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.450]  You don't just, quote, deport the gangs.
[00:10:27.629 --> 00:10:29.769]  You don't just shut down the border.
[00:10:30.009 --> 00:10:35.110]  You don't just kick the NGOs out that are in command of the Border Patrol on record when you go down there.
[00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:41.710]  You, simultaneously in the task force, and General Flynn agreed, and that's what's going on, by the way.
[00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:49.070]  You go after the human traffickers at the grassroots.
[00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.929]  And then they all roll and you already have the blueprint.
[00:10:52.929 --> 00:10:54.269]  It was all publicly done.
[00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.210]  And then you move straight up.
[00:10:57.009 --> 00:11:05.490]  And then the public sees that and the deportation starting with the criminal gangs, the MS-13, the Venezuelan gangs, and the human traffickers.
[00:11:05.909 --> 00:11:07.970]  Everyone gets behind the deportations.
[00:11:08.289 --> 00:11:12.029]  And then you move down to the military-age males and the rest of it.
[00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.549]  And the women that were smuggled here and the children, they are refugees.
[00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:20.889]  They are victims of the globalists, of the UN, of the Democrat crime syndicate.
[00:11:21.289 --> 00:11:24.850]  And then you make them public.
[00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:26.840]  You give them support.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.340]  You bring in real conservative and Christian and patriotic nonprofits.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.600]  And they are refugees from the UN sex slave trade and slave trade.
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.799]  And they get to stay.
[00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:42.860]  That's what Trump does.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.539]  And then we make them Americans.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.340]  That's the moral high ground.
[00:11:50.139 --> 00:11:52.220]  We let the government commit these crimes against them.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.139]  We bring it all out.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:54.960]  We admit it all.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:02.399]  We have, just like the communists do, but we do it as patriots, truth and reconciliation commissions.
[00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:12.039]  It's all over television for years, and we destroy the Democratic Party, we destroy the UN, we destroy the NGOs, and we regain America's soul at the same time.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.120]  Now, that's my plan.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.139]  And I can tell you that's the common sense plan.
[00:12:18.379 --> 00:12:26.419]  And I can tell you that that is the plan that is being prepared right now.
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.720]  And you heard Flynn say, yeah, Alex, let's not tell him too much.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.299]  We want to be caught flat-footed.
[00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:34.019]  They know.
[00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:37.019]  And I'm going to say this again.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.379]  If we don't hit them hard with this, A, it's the right thing to do.
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.100]  God's watching.
[00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:44.240]  We weren't given this victory.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.700]  God's hand wasn't on Trump for nothing.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.399]  We then morally are now aiding and abetting this.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.179]  We don't go all the way.
[00:12:52.379 --> 00:12:57.519]  And if we don't get the enemy off balance and defeat them now, they're going to reconstitute and they're coming after all of us.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.779]  So yeah, they're right.
[00:12:58.899 --> 00:13:00.840]  When we got into office, we are coming for you.
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.600]  It's true.
[00:13:02.019 --> 00:13:03.559]  Because you've committed mass crimes.
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.600]  It's not a vengeance.
[00:13:05.039 --> 00:13:05.799]  It's justice.
[00:13:05.799 --> 00:13:07.200]  And we can't let you commit it again.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:18.539]  Now, you already see the Border Patrol and the DHS and the NGOs, people that were contractors going public all over the place for years, saying, we're not part of this.
[00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:20.600]  Those people are heroes.
[00:13:21.059 --> 00:13:22.960]  And so it's not the Border Patrol.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.899]  It's not mostly even the employees.
[00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:25.899]  They hate it.
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:34.059]  Then they hand them off to people literally on airfields and in fields and in parking lots at Walmarts at 3 a.m.
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.740]  And like, there's no paperwork.
[00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.250]  And so that's where the investigation starts.
[00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.950]  And so those whistleblowers are all in Congress.
[00:13:44.129 --> 00:13:44.870]  More whistleblowers.
[00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:45.769]  Hearings.
[00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:47.470]  You bring it out.
[00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.929]  And then Trump will have control of the Justice Department.
[00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:57.190]  And then these criminals that have been hijacking the government to commit these crimes, just like the Nazis, they have to learn they're not above the law.
[00:13:57.909 --> 00:13:58.549]  Nuremberg, too.
[00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:01.129]  Because if Trump goes after...
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:07.539]  Little stuff like Hunter Biden and all the things the media tries to get us to focus on, that's a diversion.
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.799]  Sure, put him in prison too.
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.399]  But we'll get to him later.
[00:14:11.419 --> 00:14:14.840]  Trump says, we're going to find the missing children.
[00:14:16.019 --> 00:14:22.159]  And that's what the task forces going out are doing when they're going out to the gangs and the human traffickers as the same people.
[00:14:22.519 --> 00:14:24.139]  We're finding the children.
[00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.690]  And you protect their identities and things, but you blur out their faces and all of it.
[00:14:30.809 --> 00:14:33.129]  You interview the mothers that have been separated.
[00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.289]  You reunite them.
[00:14:35.669 --> 00:14:37.470]  You find the mothers in other countries.
[00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:38.649]  Prove it with a DNA test.
[00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:39.590]  You fly them here.
[00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:40.929]  You reunite them.
[00:14:42.029 --> 00:14:44.750]  You ask them, do you want to stay?
[00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.870]  You're a refugee of this, or would you like a million dollars to go back to your country?
[00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:49.870]  Seriously.
[00:14:50.929 --> 00:14:51.950]  Because they're victims.
[00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.029]  And then we have the moral high ground.
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.399]  We shut down the criminal gangs and then ride up the chain.
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.179]  Let me explain how this works.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.580]  The Catholic Church, for example.
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:15.200]  Going back 60 plus years ago, there were, in the ecclesiastical movements, not just the Catholic Church, but that was mainly targeted throughout all the major denominations, basically globalist, leftist, homosexual rings.
[00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:16.970]  We're pedophilic.
[00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:31.649]  They go into a parish, they go into an area, they start abusing, it comes out, and then the higher-ups are told by their higher-ups, hey, cover it up, just move them to another town, another parish, because if this comes out, it'll hurt the church.
[00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.129]  But that was the plan.
[00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:42.850]  So once the church started covering it up, more and more of them get recruited in, they start taking over, to the point of, some estimates are, 30% of Catholic priests are pedophiles.
[00:15:43.049 --> 00:15:50.870]  That discredits the church, discredits We're good to go.
[00:16:10.649 --> 00:16:14.110]  And then the scouts cover it up because, oh, that'll bring us down.
[00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:17.730]  They didn't route it out until it fully basically took it over.
[00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:22.809]  And now it is a full subsidiary in almost every area of hardcore leftist pedophilia.
[00:16:22.929 --> 00:16:23.929]  That's mainstream news.
[00:16:24.789 --> 00:16:26.350]  That's how they take over institutions.
[00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:34.250]  So going back to the CIA and MI6 in the 50s using sex operatives and then kids as sex operatives to compromise people.
[00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.129]  That's all come out.
[00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:39.230]  That's what Epstein and Diddy, they're all just arms of that.
[00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:39.990]  They're just tentacles.
[00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:41.169]  They're not at the top of it.
[00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.309]  They're not even at the middle of it.
[00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:42.830]  They're at the bottom.
[00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:46.289]  That is used for global corruption.
[00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.970]  You have the UN, back when the press wasn't totally controlled.
[00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.590]  In the 90s, 2000s, thousands of articles.
[00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:52.309]  It's in my films.
[00:16:54.669 --> 00:17:09.440]  And The UN all over the world, Africa, Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, caught kidnapping children, women, loading them on aircraft, disappearing them into sex slavery.
[00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:14.559]  NATO, that's one of NATO's main businesses because that's the big secret.
[00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:15.900]  That's how they corrupt everybody.
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.019]  Everywhere the UN goes, the peacekeepers raping, murdering children, women, men.
[00:17:21.059 --> 00:17:23.599]  It's a pedophile, satanic army.
[00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.349]  And that's how they recruit, and that's how they get bad people in positions.
[00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:28.289]  And it's come out in the news.
[00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:33.829]  In Western Germany, from the 60s on to the 90s, came out in mainstream news five years ago.
[00:17:34.329 --> 00:17:42.930]  30,000 plus children placed with convicted pedophiles, part of a State Department slash German CIA project, to create a new culture and a new family.
[00:17:43.109 --> 00:17:44.910]  Little girls with pedophile women.
[00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.670]  Little boys with pedophile men.
[00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:47.890]  At age three.
[00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.069]  Then developed into sex operatives.
[00:17:50.309 --> 00:17:52.210]  Deployed by age seven.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:18:08.940]  In a giant mind control operation, Jolly and West, Ewing Cameron, partially declassified CIA programs back to the 60s, taking foster children by the tens of thousands and putting them into brainwashing, MKUltra, sex slavery, assassin programs.
[00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:12.799]  That's all on History Channel shows 20 years ago.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.920]  And who was the doctor assigned to him?
[00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:22.680]  He died recently, Jolly and West, the deputy of Ewing Cameron, the head of the MKUltra program.
[00:18:24.819 --> 00:18:27.019]  Who was the doctor with Theodore Kaczynski?
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.740]  The Unabomber in the MKUltra program.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.559]  Oh, you didn't know that?
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:30.900]  Look up.
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.660]  Theodore Kaczynski, MKUltra.
[00:18:33.299 --> 00:18:33.900]  Ewing Cameron.
[00:18:35.319 --> 00:18:37.859]  So, I'm giving you the names here.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.380]  This is how this works.
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.579]  I'm going right to the heart of it.
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:51.559]  And the globalists are going to cut off the energy, destroy the country, comfort our children, externalize the pedophilia with the transgenderism, which is beyond just raping them.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.019]  It's cutting their genitals off or chemically sterilizing them.
[00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:55.579]  Look how it's hiding in plain view, the horror.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.640]  How we've been conditioned through peer pressure.
[00:18:58.539 --> 00:19:04.240]  You have to go in and Trump has to say, or the media is going to spin it.
[00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:10.180]  There's operatives still inside DHS that will go out and do PR events.
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.799]  Where they raid women and children.
[00:19:13.059 --> 00:19:14.359]  It'll look terrible.
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:15.920]  It will backfire.
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:24.059]  That's the leftist plan to make this task force of deportations look like totalitarian when it's really survival of the sovereignty.
[00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:28.920]  So you go after the gangs, which are also the human traffickers.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.099]  You then begin to find where these 325,000 children are.
[00:19:34.259 --> 00:19:38.519]  And when they find 100 of them, it's going to be ultra-massive news everywhere.
[00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:45.990]  When they then find 1,000, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, and they are going to be found in sex slavery, slave labor.
[00:19:46.049 --> 00:19:46.730]  They already have been.
[00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.289]  Even the New York Times reported on it a year ago.
[00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.069]  They know it's coming.
[00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.210]  They got ahead of it, so they go, oh, look, we reported on it.
[00:19:51.309 --> 00:19:52.230]  Yeah, just a little bit of it.
[00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.269]  And then that annihilates the Democratic Party.
[00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.109]  The party will then be dead.
[00:19:57.109 --> 00:19:58.450]  You won't have to outlaw it.
[00:19:58.869 --> 00:20:00.710]  No one will be associated with it.
[00:20:00.869 --> 00:20:06.329]  And then you will basically have a new libertarian party.
[00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:15.009]  I'm not saying it will be the libertarian party itself, but a new liberal libertarian party that's kind of an RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbards type arm.
[00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:19.589]  And then you've got the Republican Party that's populist conservative.
[00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.609]  And then we have the two-party system there.
[00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.789]  And that is what I'm proposing.
[00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:25.970]  We must go for the jugular.
[00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:27.509]  They've already gone for ours.
[00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:28.809]  They're totally criminal.
[00:20:29.369 --> 00:20:31.210]  A bunch of neocons are pedophiles.
[00:20:31.309 --> 00:20:32.130]  They were all part of the club.
[00:20:32.309 --> 00:20:38.849]  But we've beachheaded and now expanded and are 90% control of the Republican Party right now.
[00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:49.549]  If Trump goes in and puts his people in, supercharges the economy, clamps down the border, Deports the drug gangs and the human smugglers.
[00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:50.970]  Saves the children.
[00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.569]  Doesn't just say, where are the kids?
[00:20:52.569 --> 00:20:53.490]  They're in sex slavery.
[00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:54.589]  Some are being killed.
[00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:55.390]  They're in slave labor.
[00:20:55.569 --> 00:20:56.150]  That's all confirmed.
[00:20:56.369 --> 00:20:59.029]  And then he adds, and we're going to find them.
[00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.269]  We're going to find them.
[00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.089]  And you will instantly find them.
[00:21:05.589 --> 00:21:12.589]  Muckraker and others, a three-person team, have gone out and found, just in a week, dozens of them.
[00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.970]  Or other houses.
[00:21:15.329 --> 00:21:16.869]  Hey, we're giving a four-year-old girl.
[00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:17.250]  Where is she?
[00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.089]  I had her two days, six months ago.
[00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:20.210]  I just gave them to somebody.
[00:21:20.869 --> 00:21:21.609]  Go to another house.
[00:21:22.009 --> 00:21:22.910]  Where's the seven-year-old?
[00:21:23.589 --> 00:21:25.349]  I don't know where she is.
[00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.970]  They like the girls.
[00:21:26.509 --> 00:21:27.809]  I don't know where she is.
[00:21:27.869 --> 00:21:28.849]  I sold her.
[00:21:29.769 --> 00:21:30.430]  They don't even have it.
[00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:31.089]  I sold her.
[00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:32.049]  Who?
[00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:32.490]  I don't know.
[00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:33.630]  Some guy in a van.
[00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.309]  I mean, this is congressional testimony.
[00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:40.690]  And they just thought they'd do something so evil, so crazy...
[00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:46.710]  That the Border Patrol and the judges and everybody would all be corrupt and they'd just cover it up.
[00:21:46.829 --> 00:21:48.470]  No, they didn't make them cover it up.
[00:21:48.809 --> 00:21:51.710]  I have had meetings with top federal judges.
[00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.950]  Top federal officers.
[00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.230]  I mean, when I say top, I mean in whole sectors.
[00:21:59.089 --> 00:21:59.410]  Alright?
[00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:02.410]  And many of those meetings.
[00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:04.450]  Asking me what they should do.
[00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:07.150]  And I said, well, I mean, I know this is going on, but you're the ones that see it all.
[00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.730]  What should I do?
[00:22:07.829 --> 00:22:08.589]  You've got this backwards.
[00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:10.690]  They said, well, do what you do.
[00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:11.710]  Get the word out.
[00:22:11.849 --> 00:22:13.230]  And here are our court cases.
[00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:13.930]  This is not secret.
[00:22:14.329 --> 00:22:19.670]  We're not allowed to prosecute four-time convicted pedophiles caught running disabled children's buses in this town in Texas.
[00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:20.250]  Here's the article.
[00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:20.970]  Here's the case.
[00:22:21.069 --> 00:22:21.369]  Do this.
[00:22:21.829 --> 00:22:23.069]  We can't get anybody to cover it.
[00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.109]  This is a good place to start.
[00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:33.329]  And we've got the footage of them every hour handing off babies in South Texas at the airport with no paperwork and saying, this is my baby when it's not.
[00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:38.589]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:22:40.809 --> 00:23:01.509]  So, if you want to stop these people, we can fight a whole bunch of battles with them and go, you know, oh, we're going to indict this former head of a federal agency because they had a secret email server and we're secretly, you know, getting hundreds of thousands of dollars from an energy company that they advise Congress to fund.
[00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:04.509]  We can do that later.
[00:23:06.299 --> 00:23:08.799]  You go after the human traffickers, the gangs.
[00:23:08.819 --> 00:23:10.000]  It is legitimate.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.920]  It's the right thing to do.
[00:23:11.119 --> 00:23:16.299]  And then you obviously go after the really bad guys first and everybody gets behind it.
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.059]  They're planning on trying to demonize it and make it look bad.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.880]  No, you go after the hardcore criminals, the smugglers, you save the kids.
[00:23:23.259 --> 00:23:24.180]  That's phase one.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.200]  And then you go after all the military-aged men and the people that are on welfare that are illegally.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.500]  And, you know, there's 25 million of those just the last four years.
[00:23:32.599 --> 00:23:34.039]  They got plenty to do.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:42.700]  And then you got to go after the liberal NGOs, the law firms, the leftist groups that sign them up for welfare, sign them up for jobs, take most of their paycheck.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:43.960]  These people are being exploited.
[00:23:45.019 --> 00:23:46.319]  And you arrest them.
[00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:47.920]  You indict them.
[00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:59.970]  I mean, when they just start indicting the first few groups, the corporate media this time may not even try to defend it.
[00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:00.990]  They're just going to roll over.
[00:24:01.109 --> 00:24:10.710]  I mean, these people overreached so bad and committed wild-eyed crimes so gargantuan and so totally on record.
[00:24:12.869 --> 00:24:14.710]  And they just thought, well, we're the heads of federal agencies.
[00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:22.950]  We'll order them not to DNA test this little girl that's obviously not with her father or family, who they've seen come through three times with different people in the last month.
[00:24:23.049 --> 00:24:24.349]  They just used the child to get in.
[00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.190]  There's different types of crimes that are being committed.
[00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:30.109]  They just use them to get in and out and in and out over and over again.
[00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.349]  They'll just sell them to whoever will buy them.
[00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:39.130]  I mean, it is just mass corruption, but the main crime is telling them, come here.
[00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:41.710]  Once I get elected, as Biden said, immediately surge the border.
[00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:51.089]  They get here and They're sent out all these different families and people that then get a welfare check from the government.
[00:24:51.309 --> 00:24:53.309]  Part of that money is then given to the NGOs.
[00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:58.690]  So a lot of the kids are just with, you know, Democrat families that think they care and it's okay.
[00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:08.549]  And then a lot that are teenagers, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, they get put in tire factories and cereal factories and corn processing facilities.
[00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:09.349]  That's come out.
[00:25:09.809 --> 00:25:14.309]  Living on mats, not going to school, working 16-hour days illegally?
[00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:21.289]  In Michigan, in Iowa, in New Jersey, in Oklahoma.
[00:25:22.289 --> 00:25:23.670]  And they're trying to normalize it.
[00:25:23.769 --> 00:25:27.450]  You know, even the governor of Oklahoma came out a month ago and said, actually, there are a bunch of migrants.
[00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:28.289]  Let's put them to work.
[00:25:28.609 --> 00:25:31.690]  Oh, I see with these big companies with slave labor.
[00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:36.089]  And don't you know those big international companies have been caught running slave labor all over the world?
[00:25:37.109 --> 00:25:38.470]  Slavery is bigger than it ever was.
[00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:42.430]  So this is the second great abolitionist movement.
[00:25:43.319 --> 00:25:44.920]  And the UN is all about human trafficking.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.319]  They said they'd use human trafficking to bring down the West.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:26:00.319]  They'd use our social safety net when the illegals get here to farm them and hook them into welfare, into services to then drain that out, bring down the economy while the NGOs fund themselves with it.
[00:26:02.339 --> 00:26:06.220]  Then they sign them up to vote, control them as a permanent underclass.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.380]  And it hits on all areas.
[00:26:08.539 --> 00:26:12.519]  You have to understand the same models already done in Europe years before us.
[00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:14.400]  Now it's been perfected.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.099]  It's being done here.
[00:26:15.259 --> 00:26:17.220]  You expose the entire project.
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:28.059]  You educate the public by SWAT teaming and arresting the violent drug gangs, the smugglers, finding the children, tracking it back to where they were brought in.
[00:26:29.319 --> 00:26:30.599]  Having the Border Patrol as witnesses.
[00:26:30.779 --> 00:26:32.940]  Yeah, I remember this four-year-old coming through who ordered a release her.
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.000]  No DNA test.
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.220]  They testified to Congress.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:50.680]  And then you just have the hearings and then indicted the NGOs, indicted the non-profits, indicted the law firms, indicted Mayorkas, indicted Kamala Harris, indicted,
[00:26:50.759 --> 00:26:54.880]  indicted, indicted, indicted, indicted, indicted.
[00:26:55.529 --> 00:27:07.470]  This is the blueprint if we really want to remove the cancer, save the children, restore the republic, and then it rolls up into the UN, into NATO, all their human trafficking, all of it, the entire criminal network.
[00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:10.029]  If you really want to do it.
[00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:22.369]  And of course, the argument will be we can't roll those networks up, so they were set up by the US government at the end of World War II. And, no, you're just honest about it all.
[00:27:22.509 --> 00:27:26.029]  You roll up the networks, And you defeat it and you stop it.
[00:27:26.069 --> 00:27:26.950]  That's how we get our soul back.
[00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.930]  That's it.
[00:27:28.109 --> 00:27:29.869]  So, that's the master blueprint.
[00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:35.450]  I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's gonna save this country and nothing's gonna stop it.
[00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:40.009]  I've only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.809]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[00:27:42.869 --> 00:27:43.690]  I'm still not in shape.
[00:27:44.609 --> 00:27:46.009]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:47.069]  Don't tell me eating right.
[00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:47.950]  I'm not gonna buy that shit.
[00:27:48.639 --> 00:27:51.440]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[00:27:52.319 --> 00:27:53.279]  Oh no!
[00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:56.160]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:02.259]  I did it all from the alexjonesstore.com with ultimate sea moss, the ultimate seafood.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.200]  That's why, right here.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.039]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.839]  The Ozempic of the sea!
[00:28:11.319 --> 00:28:12.759]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:19.430]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the sea moss.
[00:28:19.529 --> 00:28:20.549]  And I am doing a plug here.
[00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.730]  Because, you know, we could be shut down next Tuesday.
[00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:26.190]  InfoWars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court.
[00:28:26.349 --> 00:28:29.529]  But we'll continue on in the air one way or another, working with great folks.
[00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:34.930]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not resting after this big victory.
[00:28:35.369 --> 00:28:37.349]  I am fighting through the objective.
[00:28:37.349 --> 00:28:41.890]  I am pressing the attack and saying what needs to be done.
[00:28:42.309 --> 00:28:44.309]  The place to hit the globalists...
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:29:10.980]  Out of the sea of corruption and crimes they've committed openly out of total arrogance and believing they were above the law is the Democratic Party and the UN's NGO operation We're good to go.
[00:29:16.949 --> 00:29:19.529]  Slave labor operations and sex slavery.
[00:29:20.009 --> 00:29:24.730]  And all the great investigative journalists, from James O'Keefe to Muckraker to us.
[00:29:25.089 --> 00:29:26.690]  I mean, it's like shooting fish in a barrel.
[00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:38.589]  You go down there and it's babies with no paperwork being handed over to people in buses, aircraft, weirdo men coming out, loading little girls on buses, saying they're mine, ha ha ha.
[00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:42.390]  We had undercover cops in where he's saying, I'm here for little girls, get them to me.
[00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:46.470]  I mean, that's three years ago we got that footage.
[00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.670]  It's so insane.
[00:29:49.289 --> 00:29:50.930]  It's so cut and dry.
[00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:54.750]  It's ridiculous.
[00:29:55.009 --> 00:29:59.670]  It is unbelievable, and it's how the globalists blackmail and control.
[00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:06.430]  It will make the Epstein affair look like a grain of sand in a sandbox.
[00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.349]  Okay?
[00:30:09.009 --> 00:30:14.549]  And you pull this thread out like the Christmas sweater, the whole thing just unravels.
[00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.369]  Right up the arm, right up the neck, and the whole thing just...
[00:30:17.369 --> 00:30:21.289]  And the public knows, the public understands.
[00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.049]  That's how they took over the Vatican and the Catholic Church.
[00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:25.210]  It's how they took over the Boy Scouts.
[00:30:25.349 --> 00:30:26.630]  It's how they're taking over the colleges.
[00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:30.069]  It's how they're taking over the primary schools.
[00:30:31.369 --> 00:30:41.789]  I mean, they're setting up these LGBTQ clubs and then counseling your children secretly as young as five or four, that you're really another gender, don't tell your mommy, don't tell your daddy.
[00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.730]  That's grooming.
[00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:47.849]  And it's being done out in the open, hiding in plain view like it's normal.
[00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:50.869]  This is their societal takeover.
[00:30:51.069 --> 00:30:55.430]  But humanity finally woke up to the men and women's sports and all of this.
[00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:59.849]  They're doing outlandish, outrageous things to break our will.
[00:31:00.029 --> 00:31:05.829]  To normalize totally bizarre stuff that there are no X and Y's chromosomes and two men can have a baby.
[00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:11.109]  Those are litmus tests of the cult to get you to accept anything.
[00:31:12.109 --> 00:31:15.869]  And then 325,000 missing children?
[00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:20.109]  That the government brought in and disappeared?
[00:31:21.349 --> 00:31:26.069]  Remember, we got the news a year ago that Biden ended DNA testing that only cost like $100.
[00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:27.630]  They get in less than a day.
[00:31:27.849 --> 00:31:32.130]  They can tell if it's a mother, the father, the aunt, the uncle, a first cousin, second cousin, no relation.
[00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:36.150]  You see a little girl, a little boy that you've already seen a couple times come through.
[00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:40.609]  There was some men that the child speaking in Spanish going, no papa, no papa.
[00:31:41.329 --> 00:31:42.930]  Me, my, my mommy, my mommy.
[00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:49.730]  A lot of these kids, I've talked to the war patrol on air and whistleblowers are like, you'll be talking to a six-year-old girl begging in Spanish.
[00:31:50.829 --> 00:31:52.210]  I was grabbed in my town.
[00:31:52.329 --> 00:31:53.390]  This is my mommy and daddy.
[00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:53.849]  They live there.
[00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:54.710]  Please take me home.
[00:31:55.829 --> 00:31:56.829]  This is not my father.
[00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:57.569]  This is not my mother.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:03.000]  And then Mayorka's, on record, testimony, they say, sorry, you have to stay.
[00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:18.099]  And we're going to just take away your identity, in most cases, no paperwork, and just fly you to New Jersey, fly you to New York, fly you to Illinois, fly you to Florida, fly you to Oklahoma, fly you to Washington State, fly you to Colorado, fly you to North Dakota, fly you there,
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:23.839]  and just, the vans pull up, people get out, they hand over the kids, as young as three months.
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.180]  Congressional reports.
[00:32:27.799 --> 00:32:30.440]  And they thought they'd commit a crime that big.
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.460]  And that it'd be so horrible that they would just normalize it.
[00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:40.180]  Kind of like killing 30 million people according to insurance actuaries with the poison shots.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.380]  In the government databases, directly that.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.799]  That's set to all be released.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.740]  We've already got databases out of three countries that were leaked.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.400]  They arrested all those that leaked them.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:49.960]  But now we know.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.380]  So we're going to get them.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.839]  And we're going to expose it all.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.779]  But you release the vaccine files, then you indict Fauci and others.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:06.160]  You release the information on the NGOs, the trafficked children.
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.339]  Trump has a task force to go find the children.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.619]  That's the first thing he does.
[00:33:10.839 --> 00:33:14.559]  On the leading tip of the spear edge of the deportation operation.
[00:33:15.099 --> 00:33:17.420]  The gangs, the smugglers, where are the children?
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.559]  That's mission one.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.160]  Then you move down to the military-aged men, the Hezbollah, the Hamas.
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.259]  And then the whole public gets behind it.
[00:33:24.279 --> 00:33:25.099]  It's the right thing to do.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:30.259]  And you bring down the entire leftist power structure right into the UN, right into the globalist operation overseas.
[00:33:31.579 --> 00:33:33.440]  This is how they got the government corrupt.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:38.579]  This is how they took over with the pedophile rings decades and decades ago of the major institutions.
[00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:40.710]  And now it's happening everywhere.
[00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:49.869]  And the exact same blueprint you saw the Catholic Church taken over in many areas by these people is the blueprint they're using against every other institution.
[00:33:49.869 --> 00:33:55.529]  Think, if they can get the Catholic Church, I mean, where the Pope is, you know, a kingpin that used this to get into power.
[00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:58.809]  That was their final coup getting this current guy in.
[00:34:00.289 --> 00:34:01.890]  Think about what else they can take over.
[00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:03.369]  Well, they almost got America.
[00:34:03.789 --> 00:34:06.529]  And for four years, they've been in control.
[00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:09.429]  And then they thought, well, let's just totally normalize it all.
[00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:10.789]  Bring in the kids.
[00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:11.670]  Don't do DNA testing.
[00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.889]  Because I thought a year ago he officially ended it.
[00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:24.070]  But it turned out when he got elected and stole the election within two months of being in office in 2021, that came out in congressional testimony.
[00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:27.650]  They ended all DNA testing at the border to cover the tracks.
[00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:43.929]  And when the Border Patrol would do their job and say, hey, this guy's got three or four convictions for pedophilia, Guatemala, Venezuela, Mexico, they would tell the federal judges and magistrates, you're not allowed to prosecute because the Justice Department controls that.
[00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:47.090]  I've had top federal judges to my face tell me that.
[00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:48.269]  And it came out in the news later.
[00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:54.769]  All they can do is hold them one month for being here illegally, statutorily, the Justice Department can't stop that.
[00:34:55.469 --> 00:35:00.829]  So they hold them for one month, We're good to go.
[00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:06.550]  We're good to go.
[00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:11.760]  And they also say, hey, here's this guy operating here.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.159]  Try to get him for something else.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:19.039]  And the cops follow him, pull him over, try to find something illegal in the car, child porn on their phone, and get him that way.
[00:35:19.219 --> 00:35:24.239]  But you imagine law enforcement and the good judges, federal and local, putting up with this.
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:28.699]  But they stay in there because they can still find ways to get some of these people.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.920]  And the vast majority of the police and the feds are good.
[00:35:34.179 --> 00:35:35.940]  They are compartmentalized.
[00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:37.260]  It is the top...
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:42.760]  It's the same federal task force units that staged the Whitmer fake kidnapping.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.159]  This came out in Congress that ran the J6 setup.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.579]  There's only a few of these units, folks.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.340]  Most of the...
[00:35:53.269 --> 00:36:01.369]  The bureaus of the Justice Department are political and corrupt, but nothing compared to the Southern District and D.C. They run all the political attacks.
[00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:03.510]  Trump will be in control of those.
[00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:09.110]  So he puts his people in, and they already tried to kill him.
[00:36:09.269 --> 00:36:10.489]  They're coming after all of us.
[00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.809]  Yeah, they're going to try to kill us again.
[00:36:11.929 --> 00:36:12.989]  They're going to try to put me in prison.
[00:36:13.719 --> 00:36:15.579]  But I'm not going to sit up here and be a coward.
[00:36:15.679 --> 00:36:16.039]  And let me know.
[00:36:16.179 --> 00:36:18.300]  I mean, let me tell you, I've got a gut and I'm smart.
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:24.400]  I know doing this right now is the most hardcore thing, the most dangerous thing to the globalists.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.159]  These are serious, hardcore demons.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.460]  But somebody's got to stand up for these children.
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:33.380]  And they're just going to reconstitute and come after everybody anyways if we don't beat them.
[00:36:33.519 --> 00:36:40.199]  So you've got to politically, culturally, legally, and lawfully cut the head off.
[00:36:41.489 --> 00:36:43.469]  So, they've been trying to cut our heads off.
[00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:48.570]  They've been trying to kill us and put us in prison and killed a bunch of people and all this stuff.
[00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:51.190]  So I'm just like, alright, well, you want to fight?
[00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.869]  You got one.
[00:36:52.289 --> 00:36:54.050]  So, here I am.
[00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:55.110]  And here I am.
[00:36:55.289 --> 00:36:55.829]  That's it.
[00:36:56.909 --> 00:37:00.170]  I told you a lot that we're not stopping and we're going to beat you.
[00:37:00.409 --> 00:37:02.070]  I believe in humans.
[00:37:02.449 --> 00:37:04.869]  I believe in the good guys more than I believe in the bad guys.
[00:37:05.539 --> 00:37:06.480]  I think you're like me.
[00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:07.460]  I think you're red-blooded.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.400]  I think you love God.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.320]  I think you're strong.
[00:37:09.519 --> 00:37:10.980]  I think you don't want to be part of this.
[00:37:11.079 --> 00:37:13.360]  And I think you're tired of living on your knees or on your belly.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:20.320]  So I want you to take this live feed at Real Alex Jones right now and I want you to email it on your email list.
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.099]  Text message to your whole text message list.
[00:37:22.619 --> 00:37:33.679]  Share it all over X. Share it where you say, Alex Jones is on air laying out the blueprint of if Trump really wants to come in with a direct blow and put them completely on their heels.
[00:37:34.639 --> 00:37:36.000]  It's all cut and dry.
[00:37:36.239 --> 00:37:37.179]  It's all public.
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.219]  It's all illegal.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.760]  Roll it up.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.679]  Go with the gangs.
[00:37:42.059 --> 00:37:43.599]  Go with the human smugglers.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.320]  Start fighting the children.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.119]  You'll be heroes.
[00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:48.360]  It's the right thing to do.
[00:37:48.619 --> 00:37:52.380]  It will destroy the enemy once and for all, politically, culturally.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.079]  It will assassinate their character.
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.500]  It will kill their character.
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:59.159]  It will kill their names.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.280]  It will destroy them.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:00.980]  They deserve it.
[00:38:01.019 --> 00:38:01.820]  It's who they are.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.780]  And then the public will demand this.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.420]  The complete dismantling of their operation and you bring it down.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:16.559]  Because the pedophile human trafficking slavery system sits at the top of this control arm worldwide.
[00:38:18.699 --> 00:38:19.679]  Now let's go.
[00:38:21.219 --> 00:38:22.159]  Let's do it.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:34.920]  And anybody around Trump telling him not to do this, just like I told Trump eight years ago, When he called me right after the election, and I said, listen, thank you for thanking me.
[00:38:35.519 --> 00:38:36.880]  Oh, yeah, we're going to cut the taxes.
[00:38:37.099 --> 00:38:37.599]  It's going to be great.
[00:38:37.699 --> 00:38:38.199]  We're going to make America great.
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.539]  And I said, sir, you know, they're inside.
[00:38:39.539 --> 00:38:40.280]  They're coming after you.
[00:38:41.019 --> 00:38:42.980]  And I said, you've got to go after them.
[00:38:45.059 --> 00:38:47.280]  And that's what this is about.
[00:38:49.099 --> 00:38:57.900]  So only General Flynn and Steve Bannon inside that first Trump few months were telling him the same thing.
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:38:59.800]  And that's why we all got targeted.
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.460]  Well, they've got a bigger problem now.
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.820]  They've got to target everybody, don't they?
[00:39:04.619 --> 00:39:11.500]  And I briefed Joe Rogan, and I briefed a bunch of other people on this.
[00:39:11.579 --> 00:39:11.980]  They agree.
[00:39:12.719 --> 00:39:16.039]  And I'm educating everybody about where to hit the enemy.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.059]  And it's the right place to hit them.
[00:39:21.059 --> 00:39:26.639]  It will totally turn what needs to be done shutting down the UN replacement migration.
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:32.539]  It will make it glow with a heavenly glow because it's the right thing to do.
[00:39:33.639 --> 00:39:39.840]  And it will make us basically invincible if we just execute this because God's on our side.
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.980]  So that's it.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:43.900]  That's what you do.
[00:39:44.239 --> 00:39:46.519]  That's more important than turning the economy back on.
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.340]  It's more important than all the other issues, which are important.
[00:39:49.599 --> 00:40:05.340]  But if you don't stop the human slavery, the sex slavery, if you don't bring that out, the networks inside the government that ordered people to commit these crimes, who will be given amnesty because they go public,
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.519]  the low-level people, they will continue to run these networks.
[00:40:09.119 --> 00:40:10.820]  And they will continue to abuse children.
[00:40:11.159 --> 00:40:13.219]  And they will continue to control the government with this.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.699]  You have to remove it.
[00:40:16.769 --> 00:40:18.570]  And you have to shut them down.
[00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:21.010]  It's absolutely essential.
[00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:24.489]  This is how you defeat them.
[00:40:24.829 --> 00:40:26.250]  This is how you stop them.
[00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:28.250]  This is what must be done.
[00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:35.650]  And I'm going to take this first 45 minutes of the show or so, in just the next 30 minutes or so, it'll be on X at Real Alex Jones.
[00:40:36.329 --> 00:40:41.929]  And it's great that the Flynn interview yesterday has 20 million views or whatever.
[00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:43.949]  We have...
[00:40:43.949 --> 00:40:45.750]  I gave you wrong numbers yesterday.
[00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:54.530]  I was saying we had 200 plus million views Tuesday night and yesterday morning.
[00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:55.389]  That's not true.
[00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:59.269]  It's almost 400 million.
[00:41:00.489 --> 00:41:06.769]  So I can tell you right now, just anywhere I go, this is being talked about everywhere.
[00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:13.969]  So no matter what happens to me, in fact, if something happens to me, take this show and this is why they killed me.
[00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.829]  All right?
[00:41:16.099 --> 00:41:17.760]  Or they indict me or whatever.
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:23.380]  And I've already made my decision.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.579]  I feel really good about this.
[00:41:24.659 --> 00:41:25.360]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.460]  I'm on the side of these people.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.039]  Those children are in sex slavery begging God for help right now.
[00:41:30.139 --> 00:41:31.860]  And physical slavery.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.820]  They're calling out to God right now.
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.679]  And God then calls out to his people to go save them.
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.159]  God is working through us, and I will follow God's orders.
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:46.000]  I will execute these orders as if they are the word of God, because it is.
[00:41:46.199 --> 00:41:47.820]  I take my orders from God.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.460]  I will follow these orders with extreme prejudice.
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:54.920]  Alright?
[00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:57.099]  So, that's it.
[00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.429]  And if you don't believe in God, that's your issue.
[00:42:01.489 --> 00:42:03.170]  But I'm saying, do you have a moral compass?
[00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:03.949]  Do you believe in anything?
[00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:13.369]  How would you like to be a three-year-old grabbed out of your backyard in Guatemala and shipped up here, and now you're five in two years of sex slavery with up to 15 men a day raping you?
[00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:15.809]  How would you like that, having your soul destroyed?
[00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:23.329]  Because if you don't do something about that, you are aiding and abetting it.
[00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:28.630]  All right, I'm going to stop getting into this now because I've got a lot of other angles to cover.
[00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:35.309]  And what else Trump needs to do, and what the left's up to, and more.
[00:42:35.469 --> 00:42:39.429]  And then a special guest in studio, your calls, and so much more today.
[00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.230]  But I'm going to say this right now.
[00:42:42.949 --> 00:42:44.769]  Now is the time to wear Trump gear.
[00:42:44.909 --> 00:42:47.909]  And we've got the best designs at the AlexJonesStore.com.
[00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:50.210]  You support the Second American Revolution.
[00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:52.030]  You exercise your free speech.
[00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:53.949]  You stand up to the bullies.
[00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.289]  You exercise your will.
[00:42:59.539 --> 00:43:04.480]  And it keeps this broadcast, if we're shut down next week, still on the air at the Alex Jones Network.
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:08.780]  It'll be on the radio, the TV, all the same stations.
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:09.840]  It's all set up.
[00:43:10.639 --> 00:43:13.039]  The crew, the studios, all of it.
[00:43:13.139 --> 00:43:19.019]  But we need more funds to ensure we're full power when we continue our assault.
[00:43:20.329 --> 00:43:24.449]  So you're literally, in the information war, refueling the aircraft, loading the weapons, arming them.
[00:43:25.289 --> 00:43:32.809]  We've already got a lot of weapons loaded, but we need to be fully loaded when we take off at maximum load for maximum attack when we do our attack runs in the information war.
[00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:34.150]  So...
[00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:37.570]  We're on the tarmac right now, making sure everything's straight here.
[00:43:38.289 --> 00:43:40.469]  You need to go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:43:41.489 --> 00:43:44.050]  Beautiful black shirt with an American eagle in gold.
[00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:44.909]  Says Trump won.
[00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:46.650]  Beautiful red hoodie.
[00:43:46.769 --> 00:43:48.050]  People are going crazy over that.
[00:43:48.489 --> 00:43:49.889]  We're on white with Trump won.
[00:43:50.989 --> 00:43:53.070]  Today is your Independence Day, 129.
[00:43:54.259 --> 00:43:58.719]  25, yeah, that's when we really have the Independence Day, when we keep him alive and he gets in there.
[00:43:59.179 --> 00:43:59.800]  That's great.
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:03.119]  So many new hats, all of it made right there in Arkansas.
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.400]  So you get this stuff quick.
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:05.380]  It's already being made right now.
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.300]  A lot of new Trump shirts and stuff.
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.179]  You'll take them weeks to get done.
[00:44:08.179 --> 00:44:08.980]  Not our sponsor.
[00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:09.940]  They're ready right now.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.659]  Let's get your orders in at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:44:13.639 --> 00:44:15.980]  So many amazing designs, thealexjonesstore.com.

[00:44:45.889 --> 00:44:47.090]  So InfoWars...
[00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:49.210]  It's going to be shut down next week.
[00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:51.349]  We need your support with the sponsors to continue on.

[00:44:59.309 --> 00:45:00.789]  So incredible for your whole body.
[00:45:00.929 --> 00:45:06.329]  Just the organic-based iodine in it alone is the game-changer.
[00:45:06.809 --> 00:45:09.829]  And there's a whole bunch of other game-changing amazing supplements there as well.

[00:45:25.619 --> 00:45:31.500]  And when I told the sponsor, when we were gearing up six months ago, it took them six months to get all this done.
[00:45:31.579 --> 00:45:33.880]  I said, here's some of the top manufacturers, here's the groups.
[00:45:34.179 --> 00:45:39.320]  I recommend you just get private labels from these folks who are already certified, totally badass, and already best-selling.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:40.539]  That way it's a guaranteed victory.
[00:45:40.539 --> 00:45:40.940]  You love it.
[00:45:41.019 --> 00:45:41.320]  It's great.
[00:45:41.619 --> 00:45:42.579]  And we get a good deal.

[00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:56.050]  Plugging.
[00:46:56.889 --> 00:47:01.469]  If a big surprise guest will tell you about coming up in the next hour, just about eight, nine minutes.
[00:47:03.969 --> 00:47:06.610]  But I want to go ahead now and just look at this.
[00:47:06.769 --> 00:47:09.170]  Talk about fear.
[00:47:10.449 --> 00:47:12.570]  Talk about the globalists knowing they're in.
[00:47:13.699 --> 00:47:14.340]  Deep trouble.
[00:47:14.579 --> 00:47:26.059]  Watching the body language of Jack Smith, the body language of Letitia James, the known Soros operative that pledged when she got elected Attorney General of New York to put, when she was running, to put Trump in prison.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:31.039]  And she's up there trying to threaten, saying Trump's going to come after New York, cut off money to New York.
[00:47:31.099 --> 00:47:31.659]  He's not going to do that.
[00:47:32.159 --> 00:47:33.679]  And that they're going to stand against him.
[00:47:33.719 --> 00:47:34.820]  They're going to keep coming after him.
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:40.239]  And the longer press conference, she says, well, we're having to drop some of this stuff, but we're going to have new charges against him.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.969]  But she looks like And so did Kamala yesterday.
[00:47:44.949 --> 00:47:49.070]  All of them just like they know they've been defeated because they've committed a lot of crimes.
[00:47:49.869 --> 00:47:53.570]  And the whole Soros network and the rest of it knows Trump is coming after them.
[00:47:54.429 --> 00:47:57.010]  They already tried to kill him, so the gloves are off, folks.
[00:47:57.789 --> 00:47:59.690]  And this is historic, so pray for Trump.
[00:47:59.869 --> 00:48:02.190]  But let's go ahead and play some of these clips.
[00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:05.309]  Let's go ahead and play...
[00:48:07.699 --> 00:48:11.980]  Clip 13, Leticia James declares she is the guardian of the law.
[00:48:12.119 --> 00:48:12.719]  Yeah, right.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:20.760]  And then we've also got the Department of Justice and Jack Smith immediately dropped their fake cases against Trump that had already collapsed anyways.
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.599]  So there you go, here's the clips.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.400]  So here we are.
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.019]  We've studied their platforms.
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:33.199]  We've identified certain possibilities, fact patterns.
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:36.039]  We've created contingency plans.
[00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:42.010]  So no matter what the next administration throws at us, we're ready.
[00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:45.949]  We're ready to respond to their attacks.
[00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:55.869]  We're ready to respond to any attempts to cut or eliminate any funding to the great state of New York, as the governor outlined.
[00:48:56.949 --> 00:49:09.469]  So despite what has happened on the national stage, we will continue to stand tall in the face of injustice, Revenge or retribution.
[00:49:10.869 --> 00:49:17.389]  We will continue to protect and our most vulnerable and marginalized amongst us.
[00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:27.909]  Because it is my sworn duty and responsibility to lead that fight, working with the governor of this great state, Kathy Hochul.
[00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:33.929]  This is not the time to be fearful, New York, but faithful.
[00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:36.309]  And steadfast.
[00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:44.210]  Knowing that I as the Attorney General, along with my entire team, we are guardians of the law.
[00:49:45.679 --> 00:49:49.659]  And we are prepared, my friends, to fight back.
[00:49:50.199 --> 00:49:50.820]  Thank you.
[00:49:51.019 --> 00:49:56.460]  Yeah, Chris, it's not a surprise that these cases can't go forward when Donald Trump takes office.
[00:49:56.639 --> 00:50:07.260]  What's interesting here is that the DOJ is moving to end them even before he takes office, citing the longstanding DOJ policy that sitting presidents can't be prosecuted.
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:17.719]  And there was some thought that maybe Special Counsel Jack Smith was going to sprint through the finish line, was going We're going to work up until the last day, force Trump to fire him, wait till a new attorney general was appointed.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.840]  But that does not appear to be the thinking inside the department.
[00:50:21.019 --> 00:50:23.739]  The thinking is that these cases can't go forward.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:29.860]  There's no reasonable prospect of getting to trial within the three months before Donald Trump takes office.
[00:50:30.099 --> 00:50:36.420]  These cases are mired in legal issues that would be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court had Donald Trump lost the election.
[00:50:36.599 --> 00:50:46.519]  So now that he's won the election, DOJ officials are thinking We're good to go.
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:51:02.400]  We're good to go.
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:03.840]  We're not subject to that policy.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.980]  And it's been dismissed, obviously, but that dismissal has been appealed.
[00:51:07.199 --> 00:51:11.739]  And the DOJ considers that ruling to be a very bad law that it would like to be overturned.
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:14.920]  So that appeal may continue in some form.
[00:51:15.119 --> 00:51:18.639]  But the reality is that Donald Trump is not going to be a part of these cases.
[00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:20.480]  And what this means, I mean, we knew this.
[00:51:20.949 --> 00:51:30.590]  Right, but just coming to grips with what this means intellectually is that Donald Trump is not likely to be held accountable on these very serious federal criminal charges.
[00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:34.690]  The president under federal law and the Constitution can declassify anything he wants.
[00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:38.269]  Biden kept stuff when he was vice president.
[00:51:38.269 --> 00:51:39.409]  That's totally illegal.
[00:51:40.489 --> 00:51:41.989]  In his garage.
[00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:44.789]  I mean, it's absolute crap.
[00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:48.190]  So you heard him just say, Trump won't be held accountable like he's guilty.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:55.420]  With the former UN war crimes prosecutor who has the worst case history ever of losing cases in the US because he's a fraud.
[00:51:56.619 --> 00:51:59.260]  And so there's a separation of powers.
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.400]  You remove a president by voting him out or impeachment.
[00:52:01.679 --> 00:52:02.739]  That's the checks and balances.
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:06.960]  Not other agencies or any DA who wants to put the president in jail.
[00:52:07.119 --> 00:52:11.179]  You can't do that or we would be in constant civil war like the left's trying to do.
[00:52:12.659 --> 00:52:15.260]  So it's not a DOJ policy they had to drop these.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:16.019]  It's the law.
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.179]  But see, people are like, oh, it's a DOJ policy.
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:18.780]  They're in charge.
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:19.000]  No.
[00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:22.320]  The DOJ, if they had that power, would be the king.
[00:52:22.519 --> 00:52:23.820]  They're claiming Trump's the king.
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:24.099]  No.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:29.199]  Merrick Garland's been acting like a king with that pedophile kingpin, Mayorkas.
[00:52:30.489 --> 00:52:31.469]  These are criminals.
[00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:32.590]  They must pay.
[00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:34.510]  We must save the children.
[00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:35.710]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:38.429]  Show, I'm just asking you to keep me in the fight.
[00:52:38.869 --> 00:52:42.289]  And we got great t-shirts and incredible blow-you-away supplements and everything.
[00:52:42.449 --> 00:52:44.730]  And our great sponsor, gallashownstore.com.
[00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:50.030]  There's a VIP section on there that I noticed was getting really a lot of traction.
[00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:51.829]  Because I hadn't really...
[00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:53.349]  There's other folks on this.
[00:52:53.449 --> 00:52:54.570]  Other folks that are great run this.
[00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:55.269]  The folks at Bigly.
[00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:56.750]  Great patriot backers.
[00:52:56.829 --> 00:52:57.409]  Total patriots.
[00:52:57.469 --> 00:52:57.929]  J-sexers.
[00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.409]  You name it.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.659]  I didn't realize how good the VIP thing was.
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:05.579]  So when I saw this the other day, I said, I better talk about this.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:16.420]  So if you're a member of the Alex Jones VIP Club at alicejonesstore.com forward slash VIP, or there's just a big link at the top of the page, this is a critical time in our nation.

[00:54:46.969 --> 00:54:53.510]  So, theallocshowstore.com forward slash VIP. Or just at the top of theallocshowstore.com, you see the VIP button.
[00:54:53.909 --> 00:54:55.829]  We're fighting the new world order.
[00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:57.710]  I don't have billionaire backers.
[00:54:57.869 --> 00:55:02.449]  I am not controlled by anybody, but my own soul, my own brain.
[00:55:02.449 --> 00:55:03.889]  I'm trying to do the best job I can.
[00:55:04.610 --> 00:55:11.880]  yellowshowstore.com It's up to you whether you want to back The number one broadcaster that the enemy hates the most.
[00:55:12.079 --> 00:55:21.199]  I mean, they literally hate my guts because they know I'm for real, and I can't be bought, and I can't be intimidated, and I'm wild, and I scare them.
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:28.460]  And I just don't know why I'm such a lovable, friendly person, but Satanist pedophiles do not like me.
[00:55:28.599 --> 00:55:30.599]  And that's good, because I don't like them either.
[00:55:31.119 --> 00:55:33.559]  And look, we've already done irrevocable harm to them.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:34.780]  We've already...
[00:55:35.659 --> 00:55:36.760]  Just devastated them.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:39.920]  I mean, world government, the new world orders, everywhere is being talked about.
[00:55:40.139 --> 00:55:41.480]  The whole world's turning against them.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:43.059]  They're super dangerous.
[00:55:43.239 --> 00:55:45.760]  They should throw in the kitchen sink at us and try to keep control.
[00:55:46.219 --> 00:55:56.440]  And I just don't think at 50 years old, after 30 years, when I understand things better than I've ever understood, that I should let these criminals, these globalists, run me to ground.
[00:55:56.599 --> 00:55:58.239]  So, again, I don't give up.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:01.119]  Vince Lombardi, winners never quit and quitters never win.
[00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:04.750]  I have moral fortitude and will and commitment.
[00:56:04.969 --> 00:56:07.210]  I just instinctively can't stand these people.
[00:56:07.329 --> 00:56:08.690]  I know they're super dangerous villains.
[00:56:08.869 --> 00:56:17.389]  I know they want to break all of our wills and make us super poor to dictate total control over the social credit score and that it's a super high-tech system of slavery.
[00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:22.389]  And you look at the globalists, they're the most slithering, disgusting snakes and scum.
[00:56:23.469 --> 00:56:25.750]  And are we going to sell out our species like this?
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.280]  I mean, it's just...
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:29.579]  This is a joke.
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:31.079]  This is ridiculous.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:32.639]  We're changing the world.
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:35.619]  They want to censor everybody because the globalists are weak.
[00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:42.199]  Tonight, with the crew in the same studio as we were eight years ago, and I just want to salute everybody.
[00:56:43.119 --> 00:56:44.239]  It is the victory.
[00:56:45.309 --> 00:56:47.769]  Who knows what they're going to pull now, but Trump has won.
[00:56:47.989 --> 00:56:49.190]  It's already being announced.
[00:56:50.090 --> 00:56:51.730]  This is a day long remembered.
[00:56:51.889 --> 00:56:52.530]  Come in here, crew.
[00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:53.090]  I love you.
[00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:55.250]  You have put up with so much.
[00:56:55.389 --> 00:56:56.389]  You've gone through so much.
[00:56:56.469 --> 00:56:59.150]  Owen went to prison, and they're going to come after us again.
[00:56:59.289 --> 00:56:59.829]  But you know what?
[00:56:59.949 --> 00:57:00.989]  They know we're not intimidated.
[00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:02.309]  They know we're going to keep fighting.
[00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:04.190]  God bless you all.
[00:57:04.269 --> 00:57:06.750]  Anybody else need to do any more of this delicious apple juice?
[00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:08.110]  I love you guys.
[00:57:08.389 --> 00:57:08.889]  Oh, yes.
[00:57:08.909 --> 00:57:10.269]  Let me give the lady here.
[00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:12.360]  Some of this here.
[00:57:12.619 --> 00:57:17.159]  All right, sorry, we were, I was dumbfounded, God smacked here.
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:21.079]  Here is to all the listeners and viewers that kept us in attack formation.
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:26.420]  Here's the President Trump, our champion, his incredible stalwart, Will, his family standing with him.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:28.820]  Here's to God, of course, number one.
[00:57:29.179 --> 00:57:32.840]  And of course, we are now going to go after the child traffickers and find out where the children are.
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:34.980]  We're going to take the floor out of the water.
[00:57:35.119 --> 00:57:36.679]  We're going to go after the poison vaccines.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.719]  We're going to stop World War III if God is with us.
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:41.420]  All praise goes to God, but God works through the people.
[00:57:41.719 --> 00:57:47.760]  And so for myself and the whole crew, on the eve of our shutdown next week, We will never surrender in the face of tyranny.
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:49.079]  We know more obstacles are coming.
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:52.199]  We know the real fight starts in the 76 days while he's president-elect.
[00:57:52.380 --> 00:58:05.619]  We pray for President Trump, but now we take a moment to celebrate that we stood against the tyrants and have won a major strategic, historic battle against the globalists, and this is just the beginning.
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:10.239]  They declared war on us, and we accepted the challenge!
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.000]  Yes!
[00:58:16.329 --> 00:58:17.550]  Yes, I love you all.
[00:58:17.949 --> 00:58:21.750]  It's been a war, and the war continues.
[00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:24.949]  I love you, Owen.
[00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:26.110]  I love all of you.
[00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:33.090]  Incredible job, and we only got two microphones here, but I would like to maybe have folks come up to the microphone in the other studio so everybody can get on air.
[00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:34.170]  But this is just crazy.
[00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:36.630]  Owen, get in here, and then Harrison, broadcast them.
[00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:37.510]  Give us your views right here.
[00:58:38.389 --> 00:58:40.389]  I think my lob mic might still be on.
[00:58:40.829 --> 00:58:41.949]  It's okay, sit down right here.
[00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:44.510]  It's over in Pennsylvania.
[00:58:44.829 --> 00:58:45.210]  It's over.
[00:58:45.369 --> 00:58:46.190]  The numbers are in.
[00:58:46.389 --> 00:58:47.409]  They can't come back.
[00:58:47.889 --> 00:58:49.269]  It's officially 270.
[00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:53.989]  Trump might wait until they officially declare it, but it's done.
[00:58:54.489 --> 00:58:55.429]  We did it.
[00:58:56.599 --> 00:58:59.460]  Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona might go for Trump too.
[00:58:59.659 --> 00:59:01.119]  So it's a little bit of a light landslide.
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:05.780]  Looks like Republicans are gonna get at least plus three in the Senate, at least plus four in the House.
[00:59:06.139 --> 00:59:10.280]  We have new leadership at both the Senate and the House level that are serious.
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:11.199]  They're behind Trump.
[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:13.000]  We have Elon Musk on our team.
[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:15.900]  We've got Vivek Ramaswamy changing the message for the future.
[00:59:16.099 --> 00:59:19.400]  We have JD Vance, who's about as down to earth as it gets.
[00:59:19.519 --> 00:59:20.340]  We have RFK Jr.
[00:59:20.519 --> 00:59:24.159]  who wants to take the fluoride out of the water, the microplastics out of the food.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:29.219]  I don't know, I'm almost in suspension right now.
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:40.539]  I can't even believe that everything we've worked for, everything we've envisioned, all the common sense barriers for us to take down to release the American potential, the potential of the American citizen.
[00:59:42.730 --> 00:59:43.670]  I really mean this.
[00:59:43.809 --> 00:59:51.409]  I hope to all the brainwashed, deranged leftists that are suffering tonight that this will be your last moment of suffering.
[00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:53.869]  I hope that they will join us in this victory.
[00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:55.309]  This is a victory for you too.
[00:59:55.570 --> 00:59:56.690]  We are freeing you.
[00:59:56.909 --> 00:59:58.250]  We are freeing your minds.
[00:59:58.429 --> 00:59:59.610]  We are freeing your bodies.
[00:59:59.789 --> 01:00:00.969]  We are freeing your souls.
[01:00:01.269 --> 01:00:02.329]  Join our team.
[01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:04.030]  We are raising the tides.
[01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:05.389]  We are raising all the ships.
[01:00:06.239 --> 01:00:09.019]  And just join the team.
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:17.579]  Even if you hate Donald Trump and you can't stand the side of him, join Team Humanity, join Team Common Sense, join Team America.
[01:00:18.039 --> 01:00:20.840]  This could be the American Revolution 2.0.
[01:00:21.059 --> 01:00:24.519]  When America was founded, it changed the entire course of human history.
[01:00:24.739 --> 01:00:26.059]  We're doing it again tonight.
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.000]  We're taking our country, man!
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:28.719]  Yeah!
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:29.599]  Yeah!
[01:00:30.219 --> 01:00:30.739]  Yeah!
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:34.360]  That's it.
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:35.000]  Anybody else?
[01:00:35.099 --> 01:00:35.619]  Get in there.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:36.179]  Come on in.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:36.800]  Rex Jones.
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:37.519]  No, I'm all right.
[01:00:37.679 --> 01:00:38.059]  All right.
[01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:39.219]  Cheers.
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:42.139]  Rob Dew, you want to scream?
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.199]  You want to let a...
[01:00:43.199 --> 01:00:44.619]  I'm just going to say this.
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:46.480]  I agree with your message.
[01:00:46.679 --> 01:00:58.519]  You know, with putting a hand out to these people who are under some serious mind control, there's a mind control going on in this country, and it's ending now.
[01:00:59.119 --> 01:01:02.079]  And people are going to see how much better their lives are going to be.
[01:01:02.179 --> 01:01:04.059]  Because a lot of these leftists are into health.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:10.900]  And now when that RFK is coming out and he's going to be hardcore on what's in our food and get that stuff, that's where it's going to happen.
[01:01:11.139 --> 01:01:14.000]  That's where these people are going to go, wait a minute, maybe I was on the wrong side.
[01:01:14.099 --> 01:01:16.079]  Maybe I didn't know what was going on.
[01:01:16.559 --> 01:01:21.400]  And if they catch more of this cheating that they're doing, we've got to get rid of these goddamn election machines.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:22.260]  They suck.
[01:01:23.619 --> 01:01:24.380]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:24.900]  Stay with us.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.420]  Well, I've been following this guy for years.
[01:01:28.539 --> 01:01:35.440]  Dave Smith's a super popular comedian and one of the most frequent guests in the Joe Rogan experience at Comic Dave Smith on excomicdavesmith.com.
[01:01:35.699 --> 01:01:38.059]  He's a comedian, political commentator, radio and TV personality.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.480]  Dave's a regular guest, obviously, on Joe Rogan and many other shows, Tim Pool and many others.
[01:01:42.679 --> 01:01:45.360]  In 2017, Dave debuted comedy special...
[01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:49.010]  We're good to go.
[01:02:02.659 --> 01:02:06.360]  Is going to be doing a show with Elon Musk down in his studios in Houston.
[01:02:06.659 --> 01:02:08.019]  So a lot of exciting stuff.
[01:02:08.179 --> 01:02:09.199]  And boy, we need Trump quickly.
[01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:11.780]  Illegal surge U.S. border out of Trump inauguration.
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:14.179]  He'll close borders with extreme security.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.780]  Yeah, we're going to find the human traffickers that Mayorkas allowed to have the children.
[01:02:18.099 --> 01:02:19.159]  I've confirmed that.
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.659]  Trump is setting up a task force.
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:27.019]  And at the tip of it, we'll be deporting the smugglers and the crime gangs from Venezuela, MS-13, El Salvador.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:31.059]  Sending them back down there to Bukele so they can get put in the slammer.
[01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:35.889]  And going after the NGOs that were involved in the human trafficking, modern slavery.
[01:02:36.289 --> 01:02:37.530]  Dave Smith, great to have you here, brother.
[01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:39.610]  Thank you so much for having me, Alex.
[01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:43.849]  And like, you know, I was a hardcore Ron Paul guy back in his presidential elections.
[01:02:43.849 --> 01:02:48.389]  And I used to, you were the only one who would give him long-form interviews back in the day, man.
[01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:49.329]  So it's cool to be here.
[01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:57.389]  And boy, is this not, they're talking about abolishing the private Federal Reserve, getting rid of the FDA. I mean, and let me tell you, they tried to kill Trump.
[01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:59.409]  He's super informed now for nine years of battles.
[01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:00.809]  This is going to be insane.
[01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:05.349]  It's really something to watch, and we'll see.
[01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:19.429]  Obviously, as you know, as well as anyone, and don't get me wrong, because this is a time for celebration, and I never want to step on anybody's optimism, but the battle is just starting, and this is going to be a battle, and even though he's got...
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:22.840]  Better people around him, I think, than he's ever had before.
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:34.320]  As you know, when you're going up against those three-letter agencies, they're going to be doing everything they can to remove all the good people in his cabinet, get him to put bad people in his cabinet, and so it's going to be...
[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:36.340]  It's going to be a real challenge.
[01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:40.800]  And hopefully he stays away from the Mike Pompeo's of the world.
[01:03:41.079 --> 01:03:44.219]  He stays away from Liz Cheney's pick for defense secretary.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.800]  And I'm optimistic that he's got...
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.860]  I think J.D. Vance has some good instincts on foreign policy.
[01:03:50.059 --> 01:03:59.000]  I think that Vivek Ramaswamy and Bobby Kennedy and Tucker Carlson and a lot of these people around him are really good on the issues that really matter.
[01:03:59.179 --> 01:04:01.679]  And to your point, I mean, on illegal immigration...
[01:04:02.519 --> 01:04:04.280]  You know, they like to use the word mandate.
[01:04:05.219 --> 01:04:16.019]  I've never seen a mandate on an issue greater than this one right now, where Donald Trump at the center of his campaign in 2016 was, we need to build a wall, we need to control illegal immigration.
[01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:20.539]  He was demonized in the most outlandish way for this position.
[01:04:20.699 --> 01:04:28.420]  And now essentially everybody has come around to admit that, yeah, this is an absolute crisis and we need to be able to control the floods of people coming into our country.
[01:04:28.619 --> 01:04:28.900]  So...
[01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:35.519]  Man, if we can't get something done about that issue now, this is the last chance.
[01:04:36.579 --> 01:04:41.579]  Well, the game changer has been Trump and how stalwart and dauntless he's been.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:51.199]  And then Elon Musk is, to use a cheesy analogy, like the first episode of Star Wars, where at the end, Millennium Falcon knocks Darth Vader out so Luke Skywalker can blow up the Death Star.
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:56.639]  I mean, Elon Musk is literally the Millennium Falcon knocking out Darth Vader there so Luke Skywalker can blow up the Death Star.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:06.320]  And, I mean, just on X, and this is how popular freedom is, everybody was having similar things happen, we had close to 400 million people watch the clips.
[01:05:06.899 --> 01:05:08.719]  Just Tuesday night through Wednesday morning.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:09.860]  I looked it up this morning.
[01:05:10.219 --> 01:05:11.199]  I stopped counting.
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:12.460]  It was up to like 380 million.
[01:05:12.579 --> 01:05:14.539]  We have at least more than that.
[01:05:14.739 --> 01:05:17.039]  We had like five videos of over 50, 60 million.
[01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:17.679]  So right there.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.739]  And then just dozens of videos of 23.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.179]  When I say, folks, it's probably, somebody's got to count it up.
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.340]  I bet it's 800 million.
[01:05:26.559 --> 01:05:29.739]  And we have the impressions on the site.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.519]  We know the numbers here.
[01:05:31.059 --> 01:05:32.519]  Tens of millions watched on our streams.
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:33.699]  It's insane.
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:36.460]  I mean, that is an indicator of how popular freedom is.
[01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:47.309]  And look, I mean, the truth is that Elon Musk buying Twitter was even more important than Donald Trump winning this election, and partially because one allowed the other.
[01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:50.789]  You know, your show is called Infowars for a reason, right?
[01:05:50.869 --> 01:06:01.690]  The whole game has always been this battle of narrative control, the propaganda of the regime versus the people who are able to kind of break that propaganda and show people how...
[01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:03.909]  Cartoonishly false it all is.
[01:06:04.289 --> 01:06:16.469]  And man, him getting Twitter, it's like, I think you've been saying this for a long time, but as long as we have freedom of speech in a meaningful way, as long as we can get our message out, the regime loses.
[01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:20.909]  Because truth, there's an unbelievable power that truth has.
[01:06:21.070 --> 01:06:22.750]  It's just more powerful than lies.
[01:06:22.949 --> 01:06:31.090]  And Elon Musk making Twitter a free speech platform, or at least a Much closer to a free speech platform than it ever was before.
[01:06:31.389 --> 01:06:35.409]  You've seen the ripple effects of tech censorship kind of being defeated.
[01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:38.389]  Yeah, ripple effects like a hydrogen bomb going off the ocean.
[01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:43.949]  Yeah, and look, obviously there's still a lot of shady stuff that goes on.
[01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:49.010]  I mean, I don't know, I'm sure you saw Elon was posting stuff about Google and what they were doing during the election.
[01:06:49.150 --> 01:07:13.159]  I mean, there was We're good to go.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.400]  This is devastating.
[01:07:15.559 --> 01:07:30.679]  We have a real chance to roll up the whole globalist, blackrock, kleptocratic system, and we're not offering some utopia, but it won't be globalists trying to make us poor, trying to divide us, trying to create racial division for control, trying to make us poor so they can dictate a global social credit score.
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:39.300]  I mean, we're promoting freedom and good societies versus the real dystopia that has been proposed and being pushed by the WEF crowd.
[01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:40.949]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:45.250]  And look, Donald Trump did some very good things in his first term.
[01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:47.449]  He also made a lot of mistakes in his first term.
[01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:50.710]  I'm really hoping that he's learned from some of that.
[01:07:51.070 --> 01:08:06.039]  And particularly, what really encourages me is that, first of all, All the people around him who I was just naming, like this kind of new core group of Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson and J.D. Vance and Vivek Ramaswamy, they're all good on Ukraine.
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:07.980]  They all want to end that war.
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:12.920]  And this war, as you know, very easily could be negotiated to a piece.
[01:08:13.059 --> 01:08:14.739]  I mean, there's just no reason to have this.
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:26.239]  Putin said up front for years, I'm going to invade and take a third of the country as a buffer zone if you continue to try to overthrow it and join NATO. And he could have already taken the whole country, and he's completely on record what he wants.
[01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:30.159]  Yeah, look, the head of NATO, whose name I always butcher, Stoltenberg.
[01:08:30.159 --> 01:08:30.579]  Stoltenberg.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:31.359]  Stoltenberg.
[01:08:31.619 --> 01:08:37.960]  He admitted, he said that, Vladimir Putin said, if you just put in writing that you won't bring Ukraine into NATO, I won't invade.
[01:08:38.119 --> 01:08:40.380]  And he bragged about how they refused.
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:45.520]  Okay, so then he invaded and now hundreds of thousands of people have died.
[01:08:45.819 --> 01:08:56.819]  And of course, it's been widely reported that there was a peace deal in the works very early in the war, that Boris Johnson went as an agent of the West to make sure that Zelensky didn't negotiate with Putin.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.319]  So all you got to do is negotiate that one away, end that war.
[01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:04.710]  What I'm a little bit more concerned about is the war in Gaza right now.
[01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:07.949]  I think a lot of people around Trump are not good on that.
[01:09:08.109 --> 01:09:15.350]  And I think that our message right now should just be very clear that Donald Trump, you have a mandate right now.
[01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:22.810]  And the mandate is control illegal immigration, turn this economy down, grapple with inflation, and end the wars.
[01:09:23.039 --> 01:09:25.460]  The American people don't want to do this anymore.
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:34.000]  We've had 20 plus years of disastrous, catastrophic terror wars that were all based on lies, had nothing to do with the people who attacked us on 9-11.
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:36.380]  None of it was going after the Sunni radical.
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:44.640]  We went after secular dictators and regime change wars in countries that had nothing to do with 9-11.
[01:09:45.039 --> 01:09:50.239]  And so anyway, at this point, we don't need to have this relationship with Israel.
[01:09:50.239 --> 01:09:53.640]  We don't need to fund and arm their slaughter of the Palestinians.
[01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:59.399]  And I think if we can get that message through to Donald Trump, and he puts the right people in his cabinet.
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:06.159]  Look, if he could just control illegal immigration, end the war in Ukraine, end our support for Israel's slaughter of Palestine.
[01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:08.010]  And turn the economy around?
[01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:09.770]  Put him on Mount Rushmore.
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:35.739]  Just don't give them any money.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.859]  Hey, do what you want.
[01:10:36.979 --> 01:10:37.819]  We're not part of it.
[01:10:37.979 --> 01:10:38.279]  That's right.
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:42.239]  And of course, it's just like, it's the same as the economic principle, right?
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:46.899]  When you bail out big banks or when you bail out big corporations, it creates a moral hazard.
[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:50.680]  Now they can be more reckless because they know they can rely on the bailout.
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:53.899]  And in the same way, we have this same dynamic with our foreign policy.
[01:10:54.119 --> 01:11:02.199]  If we give Israel a blank check and unconditional support, then of course they're going to be more aggressive than they otherwise would be.
[01:11:02.359 --> 01:11:04.800]  Yeah, because if they get a full With Iran, they know we're gonna join them.
[01:11:05.079 --> 01:11:14.420]  Right, it's like if you were to go to a bar, and then you had Mike Tyson, and he goes, hey, if anyone messes with you, I'm gonna beat the crap out of them.
[01:11:14.699 --> 01:11:20.140]  Then okay, you're gonna be a little bit more aggressive at that bar than you would be if you just had to fight the fight on your own.
[01:11:20.279 --> 01:11:22.039]  And so it's the same thing.
[01:11:22.159 --> 01:11:26.380]  And of course, as you said, Hezbollah and Hamas, they've committed atrocities.
[01:11:26.659 --> 01:11:28.340]  Nobody's on their side.
[01:11:29.050 --> 01:11:35.810]  But Israel has also committed a lot of atrocities, and they're doing it with our money and our weapons and our logistical intelligence support.
[01:11:35.989 --> 01:11:39.489]  And it's all on TV, so it's hurting us.
[01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:44.970]  I'm sad for the innocents that are dying as well, but I mean, come on people, this is bad.
[01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:56.430]  And then, I mean, I saw Mossad a few weeks ago put out videos of them with all these blown up houses and women and children and the soldiers aiming heavy machine guns at them and laughing.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:03.359]  And Israel's putting that out to enrage the Muslims and enrage people to try to get a bigger war.
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:05.779]  And that's what I said.
[01:12:05.899 --> 01:12:07.779]  I said, folks, do you see what Israel's doing there?
[01:12:08.039 --> 01:12:12.199]  I mean, that is being done literally to make this get worse.
[01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:14.750]  Yeah, well, look, two things I'll say real quick.
[01:12:14.869 --> 01:12:30.569]  Number one, to your point about how unpopular Netanyahu is, also keep in mind that after bending over backward to give him everything he wanted, I mean, things that previous presidents, moving the embassy to Jerusalem, the Abraham Accords, all the funding in the world,
[01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:34.930]  he turned around and threw Trump under the bus, stabbed him in the back.
[01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:36.029]  Wouldn't even return his phone calls.
[01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:38.470]  Yes, and he congratulated Joe Biden.
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:44.319]  Well before the results were clear, if they ever were, of the 2020 election.
[01:12:44.319 --> 01:12:47.960]  He threw him under the bus while the election was being contested, okay?
[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:49.699]  So that's number one.
[01:12:49.819 --> 01:12:57.829]  And number two, just look, keep in mind, Benjamin Netanyahu, Is the longest serving prime minister in the history of Israel.
[01:12:58.270 --> 01:13:01.409]  He was the prime minister on 9-11.
[01:13:01.670 --> 01:13:08.590]  And he came over here in 2002 and testified to our Congress and advocated that we overthrow Saddam Hussein.
[01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:10.529]  We have a regime change war in Iran.
[01:13:10.729 --> 01:13:12.829]  He advocated for overthrowing Muammar Gaddafi.
[01:13:12.949 --> 01:13:15.229]  He advocated for overthrowing Bashar al-Assad.
[01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:17.369]  He lied about WNDs.
[01:13:17.409 --> 01:13:18.430]  He's John McCain.
[01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:23.609]  If you're America first, if you're Donald Trump, well, then he's Liz Cheney.
[01:13:23.710 --> 01:13:24.909]  He's your enemy.
[01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:27.250]  He's not on the side of the America first movement.
[01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:31.569]  And right now they're trying to get us into war with Iran, which would be an absolute It's an absolute catastrophe.
[01:13:31.829 --> 01:13:33.810]  It would be ten times worse than the war in Iraq.
[01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:36.329]  So this is like priority number one.
[01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:41.170]  And of course, as you know, you don't have to hate the Jews or hate Israel or anything like that.
[01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:42.050]  I'm Jewish, by the way.
[01:13:42.869 --> 01:13:44.109]  That's not what this is about.
[01:13:44.289 --> 01:13:51.750]  The point is that America does not need to be this empty war machine that has done nothing but hollow out this country.
[01:13:52.069 --> 01:13:52.710]  Haven't we learned?
[01:13:52.989 --> 01:13:53.670]  No, exactly.
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.699]  NATO's pushed up to Russia's borders.
[01:13:57.319 --> 01:13:58.979]  China's in Russia allied with Iran.
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:01.060]  This is World War III. It's got to stop.
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:02.260]  That's absolutely right.
[01:14:02.399 --> 01:14:10.539]  And, you know, it's the old Einstein quote where he said, I don't know what weapons will be used in World War III, but World War IV will be sticks and rocks.
[01:14:11.670 --> 01:14:15.210]  It's not an option for us to go to war with Russia and China.
[01:14:15.369 --> 01:14:20.789]  This isn't as horrific as the world wars in the 20th century were, and they're the worst things that have ever happened in the history of the world.
[01:14:20.850 --> 01:14:21.930]  They'll be mild compared to them.
[01:14:21.989 --> 01:14:22.470]  That's right.
[01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:23.430]  We can't do it.
[01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:25.470]  Everybody's got too many H-bombs.
[01:14:25.569 --> 01:14:27.289]  We can't go to war with these countries.
[01:14:27.449 --> 01:14:28.130]  And also...
[01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:32.369]  My God, it's like the same thing you and Ron Paul and people have been saying for so many years.
[01:14:32.569 --> 01:14:33.850]  This is America.
[01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:46.569]  We have two giant oceans, the biggest, most powerful military in the history of the world, a huge stockpile of atomic weapons, and what do we have, 400, 500 million guns in this country?
[01:14:46.729 --> 01:14:49.210]  No one poses any threat to us.
[01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:59.529]  The only threat to the United States of America is D.C. And so enough with this foreign adventurism, peace and Absolutely.
[01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:01.010]  Absolutely.
[01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:02.710]  Absolutely.
[01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:02.949]  Absolutely.
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:20.460]  And again, Russia and China have said, prepare for war.
[01:15:20.619 --> 01:15:21.680]  We're ready to go to war.
[01:15:21.819 --> 01:15:23.079]  This has to stop.
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:24.199]  It's insane.
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.460]  And Trump is uniquely positioned to be able to do it.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:32.960]  You know, it's like the old, only Nixon could go to China type deal.
[01:15:33.159 --> 01:15:33.220]  Exactly.
[01:15:33.399 --> 01:15:39.140]  Where, you know, you kind of have to, obviously, a weak leftist isn't the one who's going to be able to bring peace.
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:40.859]  Because no one, you know what I mean?
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.220]  They see them as weak.
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:43.579]  But Donald Trump...
[01:15:43.949 --> 01:15:53.949]  Look, for some of the mistakes he made in his first administration, I know you were one of the people who pointed it out, his bombing of Syria, his backing up the Saudis in their war against Yemen.
[01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:55.949]  He made a lot of very, very big mistakes.
[01:15:56.670 --> 01:16:02.710]  But the silver lining in that now is that he's got a credible threat of not being a wimp.
[01:16:02.829 --> 01:16:10.189]  So he can come from a position of strength, and people will know he's not messing around, and say that he's gonna be the one who's ready to do this.
[01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:21.000]  And I'll tell you, all those people you were saying, All those foreign governments, China, Russia, Iran, while they might be ready for war, they're also all ready to make a deal.
[01:16:21.199 --> 01:16:23.319]  They'd also be happy to avoid the war.
[01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:26.239]  Donald Trump is in a unique position where he can do that.
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:26.859]  That's right.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:34.399]  And just to harp on Netanyahu, when he stabbed Trump in the back, Trump called for his help, wouldn't take the call, came out first to stab him in the back.
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.079]  Trump's got to remember that.
[01:16:37.279 --> 01:16:38.899]  And here's the thing about Netanyahu, okay?
[01:16:39.730 --> 01:16:41.970]  Again, he would already be removed from office.
[01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:44.210]  He stood down on October 7th.
[01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:46.310]  He said, well, we'll find out after the war why this happened.
[01:16:46.729 --> 01:16:48.149]  So he's cornered.
[01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:51.689]  We don't need World War III just so Benjamin Netanyahu can stay in power.
[01:16:51.909 --> 01:16:54.010]  I mean, he's got to be removed.
[01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:55.810]  Yeah, and like, come on, man.
[01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:57.590]  He was propping up Hamas for years.
[01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:59.270]  Like, look, October 7th was terrible.
[01:16:59.510 --> 01:17:00.149]  It was an atrocity.
[01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:03.489]  Innocent people dying anywhere at any time is horrible.
[01:17:03.569 --> 01:17:04.869]  It's the worst thing in the world.
[01:17:05.029 --> 01:17:06.550]  But if you...
[01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:13.329]  You're, let's say like in Mexico, we were occupying Mexico since the 1960s, okay?
[01:17:13.569 --> 01:17:18.949]  And then there was like a secular government or a group that wanted to rise up and be the government and make a two-state deal.
[01:17:18.989 --> 01:17:26.470]  And we decided to fund the jihadists so that they wouldn't have to rise up and we wouldn't have to give them their statehood.
[01:17:26.609 --> 01:17:28.409]  And then those jihadists attacked us.
[01:17:28.890 --> 01:17:31.170]  And by the way, that's admitted, just like the left got caught.
[01:17:31.409 --> 01:17:36.289]  Creating fake militia groups and white supremacy groups so that they can demonize a populist movement here.
[01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.789]  It's the same thing.
[01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:45.329]  Israel admits they helped fund and create Hamas, this is AP Reuters, starting in the late 70s and the 80s, to literally not have a legitimate government to deal with.
[01:17:45.489 --> 01:17:49.970]  And then now they have set up a Hamas dictatorship and they do enslave the people and they are horrible.
[01:17:50.489 --> 01:17:53.369]  And Israel, the corrupt interest there, did that.
[01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:59.789]  And it's the same thing that other governments do, like the British stayed in control of India for hundreds of years by funding bad rebel groups too.
[01:17:59.890 --> 01:18:01.109]  It's called divide and conquer.
[01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:04.170]  Yeah, it's a very old strategy, and it still exists because it works.
[01:18:04.270 --> 01:18:05.010]  It's very effective.
[01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:12.569]  But in that scenario, then, sorry, cry me a river about turning to the rest of the world and saying, we have to fund your war.
[01:18:12.729 --> 01:18:14.189]  You created this problem.
[01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:16.470]  You're the one who wanted to play this game.
[01:18:16.569 --> 01:18:21.510]  And just to your point, it's not even just the AP. I mean, it was on October 8th.
[01:18:21.649 --> 01:18:24.029]  There was a huge piece in the Times of Israel about it.
[01:18:24.109 --> 01:18:26.310]  There was a huge piece in Haaretz, New York Times.
[01:18:26.449 --> 01:18:27.529]  This is widely reported.
[01:18:27.710 --> 01:18:28.710]  Everybody admits that happened.
[01:18:28.729 --> 01:18:29.649]  Seven and a half hours stand down.
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:47.819]  We're good to go.
[01:18:47.850 --> 01:18:49.850]  I mean, look, so I don't know.
[01:18:50.109 --> 01:18:58.229]  You remember there was that hot mic or a secret recording of John Kerry when he was talking about the rise of ISIS in Syria?
[01:18:58.550 --> 01:19:05.949]  And he basically admitted that the Obama administration, they wanted to overthrow Bashar al-Assad, so they started funding any anti-Assad groups.
[01:19:06.090 --> 01:19:09.909]  And they knew that the money and weapons were going to ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[01:19:10.710 --> 01:19:17.289]  And John Kerry says on this tape, he goes, we saw the rise of ISIS, and we thought, oh, we could use them.
[01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:27.300]  We're good to go.
[01:19:34.319 --> 01:19:36.600]  There was intelligence that they were planning this attack.
[01:19:36.859 --> 01:19:42.279]  There were people who were warning the Israelis in their own intelligence community that they were training for it.
[01:19:42.439 --> 01:19:44.039]  No one did anything about that.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:50.720]  Listen, it's very hard to understand, as you said, how you have Gaza, which is the most surveilled area in the world.
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:53.100]  You have Israel, which is the fortress of the world.
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:57.500]  How does it take so many hours to have a response?
[01:19:57.779 --> 01:20:00.159]  I mean, you're talking about New Jersey.
[01:20:00.479 --> 01:20:03.000]  This is not like a huge landmass.
[01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:09.869]  You know, that's about as much as I know, but it certainly is enough to say that warrants an investigation.
[01:20:09.869 --> 01:20:11.109]  Here's an example, exactly.
[01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:24.550]  Israel just, proving some of the best intelligence in the world, wiped out all these Hezbollah and Hamas leaders in all these surrounding countries down to everywhere, I mean, basically never missed, and then magically didn't know anything before.
[01:20:24.569 --> 01:20:25.409]  Give me a break.
[01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:37.210]  And a lot of people, Max Blumenthal over at the Grey Zone, he's done some fantastic reporting on the Hannibal Directive or a version of that that was used.
[01:20:37.289 --> 01:20:43.489]  But I remember the day after, like on October 8th, I remember seeing pictures of cars lined up and they're incinerated.
[01:20:43.649 --> 01:20:49.489]  And I'm no military expert here, but I'm like, you're telling me they did that with rifles and hand grenades?
[01:20:49.649 --> 01:20:51.710]  Because that looks like a Hellfire missile to me.
[01:20:51.869 --> 01:20:52.630]  You know what I mean?
[01:20:52.750 --> 01:21:00.010]  And it does turn out that yes, Some degree of the death and destruction on October 7th was caused by the Israeli government.
[01:21:00.250 --> 01:21:02.829]  And I don't know exactly what percentage was what.
[01:21:03.210 --> 01:21:04.550]  But friendly fire always happens.
[01:21:04.909 --> 01:21:05.029]  Sure.
[01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:06.770]  Then they tried to deny it, but later had to admit it.
[01:21:06.829 --> 01:21:07.930]  No, that's what happens in a war zone.
[01:21:08.050 --> 01:21:08.170]  Yeah.
[01:21:08.449 --> 01:21:08.710]  Yes.
[01:21:08.869 --> 01:21:09.909]  Because war is hell.
[01:21:10.109 --> 01:21:12.590]  And you want to avoid them as best you can.
[01:21:12.829 --> 01:21:17.310]  Well, it's like the favorite general of the Civil War, Stonewall Jackson, got shot by his own troops.
[01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:17.590]  Right.
[01:21:17.890 --> 01:21:18.770]  That just goes on.
[01:21:18.989 --> 01:21:19.109]  Yeah.
[01:21:19.329 --> 01:21:20.090]  No, 100%.
[01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:22.289]  And look, the America...
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:30.920]  Of course, has always been, look, the United States of America has always been a tremendous force for good and a tremendous force for bad in the world.
[01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:31.460]  You know what I mean?
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:43.159]  And the great things about this country have always been our liberty, our creativity, our culture, our art, our economic advancements, things like that.
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.489]  You don't want to be known as World War III creators.
[01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:46.029]  That's right.
[01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:48.529]  But this is what's done more to liberate the world.
[01:21:48.710 --> 01:21:54.569]  It was never any neoconservative or Wilsonian, we're gonna set the world free with our military.
[01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:58.369]  We set the world free with our blue jeans and our rock and roll music.
[01:21:58.689 --> 01:21:58.810]  Soft power.
[01:21:58.970 --> 01:21:59.550]  Yes, exactly.
[01:21:59.770 --> 01:22:01.529]  And that's what America's supposed to be.
[01:22:01.689 --> 01:22:05.949]  Like Thomas Jefferson and Ron Paul always said, we're supposed to be a city on a hill.
[01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:08.390]  We have to work, you know, think about the idea.
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:21.340]  That Washington DC is gonna go around and solve a violence problem in the Middle East when they can't even solve the violence problem in Washington DC. It's absurd on its face.
[01:22:21.479 --> 01:22:23.300]  We can't even get liberty right here.
[01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:25.340]  We're not in a position to spread it throughout the world.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.920]  Let's try to get it right here.
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:42.770]  And I will say, man, I hope I really hope that Ron Paul is some type of advisor to Donald Trump, because if you really do want to drain the swamp, and I know this isn't the sexiest issue to talk about these days, but it's the stuff that the Tea Party was talking about, the stuff that Ron Paul was talking about.
[01:22:42.949 --> 01:22:47.750]  If you want to drain the swamp, what you need to do is have drastic cuts in government spending.
[01:22:48.650 --> 01:22:49.930]  That is the swamp.
[01:22:50.029 --> 01:22:51.350]  That's the guaranteed way to do it.
[01:22:51.449 --> 01:23:00.989]  As long as we have $6 trillion plus a year that's being extracted from the American people and handed out to people who are politically connected, that's the swamp.
[01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:06.050]  And this is why there's more millionaires in the suburbs outside of Washington, D.C. than anywhere else in the world.
[01:23:06.170 --> 01:23:07.050]  The richest city in the world.
[01:23:07.130 --> 01:23:07.409]  That's right.
[01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:13.670]  And it's not because there's great big factories there and they're making things and this is capitalism and they're providing more wealth.
[01:23:13.689 --> 01:23:18.130]  I've spent a lot of time in D.C. It was bad before COVID, but it's like a wasteland.
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:19.920]  Yeah, yeah, no, 100%.
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:26.539]  And look, a lot of these things, I mean, obviously, there's a lot of factors into why Donald Trump was able to win this landslide election.
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:42.600]  But I will say that one of the major factors here was the COVID regime and the fact that the media, you know, like we may have said that the corporate media had been discredited many years ago, but it's a whole different level right now.
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:44.359]  Dave Smith, man, you're awesome.
[01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:57.239]  Let's come back and get into the election, what you think Trump should do, how the left, not even the left, the fake left, the corporate bots are going to respond, what we can do, and just what a historic time.
[01:23:57.359 --> 01:23:59.279]  You cannot gauge how big this victory is.
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:02.699]  A total repudiation of the entire disinformation complex.
[01:24:03.199 --> 01:24:05.000]  It's happening, like Ron Paul said.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:05.859]  We'll be right back.
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:06.500]  Stay with us.

[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:07.239]  Welcome back.
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:10.380]  I've been watching Dave Smith's comedy and his show for years.
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:12.579]  Love him on Rogan, but man, he is great in studio.
[01:25:12.579 --> 01:25:13.680]  He's with us for another hour.
[01:25:14.239 --> 01:25:19.880]  And then for the last hour and a half of my show, I'm going to cover news, developments, take your calls, Owen Schroyer, 3 p.m.
[01:25:20.439 --> 01:25:21.359]  Central today.
[01:25:21.859 --> 01:25:24.659]  So I totally agree with your foreign policy ideas.
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:29.539]  It's all dead on common sense, great historical understanding of the different pieces there.
[01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:46.010]  Looking at Trump and looking at the corporate media and just the cartoon-level brainwashing, gaslighting, lies we saw, as you said, we've known the corporate media has lost its power and has been dead for a long time, but a lot of people like Trump still didn't understand that,
[01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:50.689]  no, Joe Rogan's a lot bigger than all these other big nightly news shows combined.
[01:25:51.829 --> 01:25:52.829]  This show is.
[01:25:54.109 --> 01:25:57.640]  Trump went on It did a two and a half hour spaces with Musk.
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.500]  They should have done more of them.
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:00.420]  It had a billion people that clicked on it.
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:01.739]  I mean, that's a billion people.
[01:26:01.899 --> 01:26:07.579]  We covered it live and we had like 50 something million on it and millions on our site.
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:10.560]  So that's just a billion on their stream.
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:21.819]  So this is an awakening of The power structure knows that it's been bluffing for many years, and there's a real desire for freedom by people of every race, color, and creed around the world, not just Americans.
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:34.880]  And I call it 1776 worldwide, not America conquering the world with military and things, but with our ideas, people adopting it, and really humans, when the good people are engaged, as Thomas Jefferson said, can do incredible things.
[01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:36.180]  And so just because we've been living under...
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:40.079]  So much corruption for so long, people get demoralized and can't believe it's real.
[01:26:40.239 --> 01:26:40.380]  No.
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:43.460]  Good is stronger than evil, but it's got to take action.
[01:26:43.810 --> 01:26:59.609]  Yeah, I mean, look, think about if you had been around in the 1760s, and someone had suggested that I think we should break away from the most powerful military in the history of the world, the British Empire,
[01:26:59.770 --> 01:27:00.789]  and we could defeat them.
[01:27:00.970 --> 01:27:03.949]  That would have sounded like pie in the sky, ridiculous thinking.
[01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:08.470]  If you had sat around, my friend Gene Epstein, who's a brilliant economist, always makes this point.
[01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:16.449]  If you had sat around in 1850, And said, you know, I think in 20 years, slavery is going to be abolished across the West.
[01:27:16.630 --> 01:27:18.310]  People would have thought you were nuts.
[01:27:18.449 --> 01:27:19.529]  There's no way.
[01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:21.689]  But that really did happen, man.
[01:27:21.850 --> 01:27:27.310]  So never forget that God is good and America is amazing and incredible things can happen.
[01:27:27.609 --> 01:27:36.289]  And one of the things that's really encouraging to me, and this was a detail that I think some people are missing because there's so much going on right now.
[01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:41.689]  But Donald Trump spoke at Madison Square Garden and there was no protest.
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:46.500]  There was like, I think the Secret Service said there were like 100 people outside.
[01:27:46.619 --> 01:27:51.279]  If he had spoken in 2016 at Madison Square Garden, there would have been massive protests outside.
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:54.760]  There would have been Proud Boys and Antifa fighting outside and all this.
[01:27:54.859 --> 01:27:59.000]  And it does seem to me that something has drastically changed here.
[01:27:59.199 --> 01:28:08.960]  And even what the media, you know, if you think about what they were able to pull off with the Russiagate nonsense, where they sat and framed the sitting president for treason for three years.
[01:28:10.090 --> 01:28:19.329]  Once that collapsed, and they had nothing, and then COVID came, and they got it all wrong, and lockdowns, and the vaccine, and everything was just based off lies.
[01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:26.840]  And now, through this election cycle, it's just like, look, as you know, as well as anyone, They've always been lying, right?
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:28.180]  Like, they lied us into Vietnam.
[01:28:28.199 --> 01:28:31.180]  They lied us into World War I. They lied us into Iraq, right?
[01:28:31.399 --> 01:28:35.739]  But the lies are getting more ridiculous and easier to see through.
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:39.159]  I mean, look, when- Trump's gonna ban interracial marriage with Goldberg?
[01:28:39.159 --> 01:28:39.920]  Come on, man.
[01:28:40.159 --> 01:28:45.539]  And look, it was a Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden, or they tried to play like my buddy Tony Hinchcliffe.
[01:28:45.619 --> 01:28:53.760]  They tried to pretend that he was just like a guy making a comment, rather than obviously a comedian doing a Don Rickles bit where he was- A famous roaster.
[01:28:54.130 --> 01:28:55.789]  Yes, where he was ribbing everybody.
[01:28:55.789 --> 01:28:58.569]  He made fun of Jews and Muslims and Puerto Ricans.
[01:28:59.670 --> 01:29:13.750]  And then, look, after the Joe Biden as sharp as a tack, and then they tried to pretend that Kamala Harris was joy and hope and change, and she was gonna be the next Obama phenomenon.
[01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:20.310]  They've just gone to the well too many times, to the point that, look, the results speak for themselves.
[01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:23.250]  They told you that Donald Trump was Adolf Hitler.
[01:29:23.550 --> 01:29:29.050]  And then he won a landslide victory, which by the way, I will say I did think Donald Trump was gonna win.
[01:29:29.229 --> 01:29:32.149]  I was shocked that he won by as much as he did.
[01:29:32.409 --> 01:29:37.029]  In today's political environment, I didn't think it was possible to have a landslide victory like this.
[01:29:37.170 --> 01:29:46.710]  And so it really is like a repudiation of the corporate media, what they used to call the mainstream media, but we really can't call it that anymore.
[01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:47.409]  I call it the dinosaur.
[01:29:47.439 --> 01:29:48.340]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:29:48.619 --> 01:29:52.199]  Because look, that's your show and Joe Rogan's show and all these.
[01:29:52.439 --> 01:30:02.520]  I mean, Donald Trump did Andrew Schultz's podcast and he did Theo Vaughn's podcast and he did Lex Friedman and he did a whole bunch of them.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:07.939]  These numbers dwarf anything that the corporate media is putting out.
[01:30:08.079 --> 01:30:14.500]  Even Fox News, who's the biggest in the cable news space, they don't put up numbers anything like what these other guys are.
[01:30:14.619 --> 01:30:16.939]  I was watching Fox's screams.
[01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:19.750]  And they had like 30,000 people on it.
[01:30:19.930 --> 01:30:25.750]  And we had all these different streams with, you know, 6, 7, 8 million people watching all the time during the election.
[01:30:25.930 --> 01:30:26.770]  It's a joke.
[01:30:27.210 --> 01:30:29.529]  I mean, folks, go to Real Alex Jones right now.
[01:30:29.909 --> 01:30:31.569]  Count up just the last two days and stuff.
[01:30:31.689 --> 01:30:34.609]  When I said, I just threw out, because I quit counting, 304 million.
[01:30:34.710 --> 01:30:35.989]  No, it's probably 700 million.
[01:30:36.090 --> 01:30:39.369]  I can't even, I mean, I saw like 6, 7, 8 videos over 50 million.
[01:30:39.829 --> 01:30:41.109]  Dozens with 20, 30 million.
[01:30:41.369 --> 01:30:45.250]  And just everything else with 10, 5, 12 million, I mean, and we see the numbers here.
[01:30:45.409 --> 01:30:47.010]  Our servers are melting.
[01:30:47.069 --> 01:30:49.310]  And again, everybody's getting huge numbers.
[01:30:49.649 --> 01:30:55.630]  Everybody who, and look, all the hottest talk show hosts, Elon Musk, everything's, you know, anti-establishment.
[01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:57.279]  Yeah, 100%.
[01:30:57.279 --> 01:31:02.359]  I mean, by the way, I'm like a hardcore Ron Paul libertarian.
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:06.859]  So I love Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard and all the great libertarian economists.
[01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:18.170]  And man, watching Elon Musk on Joe Rogan's podcast explain property and production and the way an economy works, it was like, to me, this was just Perfection.
[01:31:18.649 --> 01:31:21.010]  And to think of how many people are seeing that now.
[01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:33.930]  When I used to watch you and Ron Paul back in 2008, we never could have imagined that we'd be in the position that we're in right now.
[01:31:34.029 --> 01:31:34.630]  You know what I mean?
[01:31:34.729 --> 01:31:36.529]  The tools that we have.
[01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:42.149]  Back then, if you were blacked out of the corporate media, that was it.
[01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:45.029]  There was no other way to get your word out.
[01:31:45.109 --> 01:31:48.850]  I mean, you could have a little newsletter or something like that.
[01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:51.189]  But now, that's the whole game.
[01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:55.970]  And the fact that it actually decided a presidential election, like the narrative rights itself.
[01:31:56.149 --> 01:32:00.369]  He went on Joe Rogan, she refused, and she got blown out.
[01:32:00.569 --> 01:32:01.649]  That is beautiful.
[01:32:01.689 --> 01:32:04.250]  And the possibilities are really endless.
[01:32:04.590 --> 01:32:10.550]  And then as people like Trump, who is a maverick, is anti-establishment, who's pro-prosperity, anti-war...
[01:32:11.150 --> 01:32:18.390]  Still, he admits, and I was told before it came out, Barron had to explain to him his young son, and it's the same thing.
[01:32:18.529 --> 01:32:19.989]  But all the Mitch McConnells are going away.
[01:32:20.050 --> 01:32:20.810]  It's all going away.
[01:32:20.890 --> 01:32:24.510]  And the old guards realizing it doesn't matter if CNN attacks you.
[01:32:24.609 --> 01:32:25.329]  You don't have to respond.
[01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:26.869]  They have almost no viewers.
[01:32:27.029 --> 01:32:27.529]  It's a joke.
[01:32:27.829 --> 01:32:30.250]  The last power the corporate dinosaur media had was...
[01:32:30.789 --> 01:32:38.489]  Older people in government corporations believe we can have power and being bullied by them and letting them set the agenda by putting out lies that people responded to.
[01:32:38.630 --> 01:32:45.029]  At a certain point, now I get attacked every day, I don't even respond to it, because it's just changing the subject from us setting the agenda.
[01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.810]  Oh, that's right.
[01:32:45.989 --> 01:32:49.029]  I mean, because they're just, again, they just lie too much.
[01:32:49.149 --> 01:32:51.109]  And now nobody's trusting them anymore.
[01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:53.979]  And so, you know, they're- That is the dynamic.
[01:32:54.279 --> 01:33:00.039]  And in fact, you could even go a step further and go, that's the sign that you're being successful and you're being effective.
[01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:07.920]  If you're being effective, then you're going to be attacked by CNN. If you're not being attacked by CNN, that's kind of suspicious in a way.
[01:33:08.039 --> 01:33:10.359]  Like, what's going on with you that they're not trying to smear you?
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:11.939]  And that's right.
[01:33:12.039 --> 01:33:22.770]  And look, to Donald Trump, and hopefully he's at this point, Where you go, look man, every time you try to play nice with them, they're still gonna throw you under the bus and attack you.
[01:33:22.829 --> 01:33:24.750]  They're still gonna smear you in the most vicious ways.
[01:33:25.010 --> 01:33:26.710]  Look, they've tried to impeach the guy.
[01:33:26.890 --> 01:33:28.289]  They've tried to imprison the guy.
[01:33:29.109 --> 01:33:31.250]  They've tried to assassinate the guy.
[01:33:31.489 --> 01:33:34.529]  So at this point, why not just go for it?
[01:33:34.829 --> 01:33:37.710]  Why not just say like, hey, we're really gonna roll this thing back.
[01:33:37.869 --> 01:33:39.930]  We're really gonna drain the swamp.
[01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:44.529]  But the answer here, right, is that, and I know you know this, there is no reform.
[01:33:45.529 --> 01:33:48.090]  We need institutions abolished.
[01:33:48.109 --> 01:33:54.770]  If we really want to do this, the CIA and the NSA and the FBI all have to go.
[01:33:55.010 --> 01:34:02.189]  And I know that's scary to a lot of Americans, but believe me, this is actually what's occupying our government right now.
[01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:06.649]  And all those people in the corporate media, you know, they're totally beholden to the intelligence agencies.
[01:34:06.829 --> 01:34:09.250]  I mean, half of them probably are the intelligence agencies.
[01:34:11.329 --> 01:34:12.550]  Give them disinfo.
[01:34:12.689 --> 01:34:16.470]  Give them lies as they're spying on the American people.
[01:34:16.770 --> 01:34:17.789]  This is a joke.
[01:34:18.670 --> 01:34:19.229]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:31.109]  And so, look, it's the machine, the propaganda machine has been fractured, again, like I said, in a way that would have been a pipe dream just 15, 20 years ago.
[01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.829]  So the spell is dropping.
[01:34:31.949 --> 01:34:32.750]  The illusion is crushed.
[01:34:32.869 --> 01:34:33.729]  They now admit it.
[01:34:33.850 --> 01:34:34.170]  They look...
[01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:49.050]  We're good to go.
[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:55.840]  We have to create some amnesty program.
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:16.439]  Don't trigger a new war or something to try to stay in power, which they're saying they're thinking about doing.
[01:35:16.899 --> 01:35:22.239]  Because I'd like to have some detente to the establishment, abolish the agencies, do all that, put some of the kingpins in prison, that's justice.
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:31.359]  But at the same time, studying history and warfare, the problem is they're so corrupt, even if Trump offered them detente, I don't know if this corrupt Western establishment will do it.
[01:35:31.439 --> 01:35:32.260]  So how do you see that unfolding?
[01:35:32.539 --> 01:35:38.640]  Yeah, man, I mean, that really is kind of the most important question, and I'm not going to pretend I have the perfect answer for it.
[01:35:38.779 --> 01:35:53.539]  I mean, I know you can look at, so I know when the Soviet Union collapsed and there was German reunification, a lot of those people who were like commies in East Germany, but rank and file, they paid them off.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.100]  They gave them their pensions.
[01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:55.979]  You know what I mean?
[01:35:55.979 --> 01:35:58.279]  It's kind of like, listen, we're going to move past this.
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:03.880]  We're going to forgive and forget the fact that you were part of the communist system because we can't prosecute everybody.
[01:36:05.199 --> 01:36:06.119]  I agree with you.
[01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:08.460]  The top level people need to be prosecuted.
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:15.619]  But there has to be a certain line where you draw it and you say, okay, everybody below this, go on your way.
[01:36:15.859 --> 01:36:16.619]  We're making peace.
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:17.960]  Just like at the end of our civil war.
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:18.859]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:20.220]  Because what else are you going to do?
[01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:23.779]  And so that is a big thing that we got to figure out moving forward.
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:27.340]  And I will say that I've seen a lot of people.
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:40.359]  Okay, look, we all know, right, one of the best parts of Donald Trump winning the presidency, both in 2016 and again in 2024, is watching CNN and The View and People melt down and lose their minds.
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:41.439]  It's very satisfying.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:42.140]  It's very funny.
[01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:48.979]  But I do also see a lot of people posting videos of just some crazy left-wing person crying.
[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:52.600]  And you're like, listen, I understand what they've done to you.
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:56.319]  I understand how evil and how much they smeared you.
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:00.960]  This is your fellow American who has clear mental health issues.
[01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:07.449]  I think that right now, there's an opportunity for Trump supporters to To be the bigger person.
[01:37:07.609 --> 01:37:09.670]  Again, not with the people in the corporate media.
[01:37:10.069 --> 01:37:11.770]  Not with the people at the highest level of government.
[01:37:11.869 --> 01:37:12.810]  Those are criminals.
[01:37:12.970 --> 01:37:13.590]  Not with Fauci.
[01:37:13.670 --> 01:37:13.930]  Bill Gates.
[01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:15.350]  He belongs in prison.
[01:37:15.489 --> 01:37:18.850]  I'm talking about your crazy left-wing neighbor.
[01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:21.449]  We don't want to be at war with ourselves.
[01:37:21.689 --> 01:37:23.850]  And they want us to be at war with each other.
[01:37:24.050 --> 01:37:32.409]  Why do you think it is that the corporate media has been fanatically pushing for the last decade every single divisive issue that will pit Americans against each other?
[01:37:32.409 --> 01:37:34.720]  By the way, since you say this to I was already thinking about playing it.
[01:37:34.739 --> 01:37:36.779]  Guys, get the ultimate compilation of the leftists flipping out.
[01:37:36.899 --> 01:37:38.100]  It's only two minutes long from yesterday.
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:39.300]  I want to play that moment.
[01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:43.060]  But I said the same thing yesterday because I've studied history, how this works.
[01:37:43.279 --> 01:37:50.859]  We're not trying to develop and have an open debate about some type of amnesty for lower-level people because we don't want to stop the corruption.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:51.380]  It's the opposite.
[01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:54.140]  Historically smart folks, when there's a turnover...
[01:37:55.050 --> 01:38:09.770]  Know how to get the bad guys to shut down the criminal networks, and it's justice, you've got to do it, but you've got to have some program to try to reach out to the people and wake them up, or that leaves something that can grow back later that you're going to have to deal with.
[01:38:09.850 --> 01:38:20.409]  The real way to win when you've defeated people is to get them to realize they're defeated, to get them to realize they were the bad guys, to get them to realize they were in the wrong, and then to have some program to bring them back into reality.
[01:38:20.630 --> 01:38:21.250]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:38:21.529 --> 01:38:26.289]  And look, to your point, in some ways, there's a tremendous opportunity right now.
[01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:28.970]  But in some ways, this is also the most dangerous moment.
[01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:36.710]  It's like when there's an abusive husband, when the wife tries to leave, that's the most dangerous moment right there.
[01:38:36.869 --> 01:38:41.430]  Now, the correct answer is for the wife to leave, but that's a very, very dangerous time.
[01:38:41.529 --> 01:38:44.909]  Yeah, I remember one time, I think it was in an interview with you.
[01:38:45.449 --> 01:38:50.609]  I can't, but it was when Ron Paul was running for president, and someone said, I think it was you, but I could be wrong about this.
[01:38:50.789 --> 01:38:55.130]  But you were asking him, okay, when you get in there, what are you going to say to the CIA, to this, to this?
[01:38:55.250 --> 01:38:57.390]  Are you going to tell them we're shutting this down, we're shutting this down?
[01:38:57.529 --> 01:39:00.630]  And he was like, I'll probably try to be nice about it.
[01:39:01.090 --> 01:39:05.270]  Because he's just a little bit like, well, look, you got to be careful in this situation.
[01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:06.789]  You want to be smart.
[01:39:07.029 --> 01:39:08.130]  You want to give them a layout.
[01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:10.729]  If they feel cornered, then it's going to get violent.
[01:39:10.949 --> 01:39:11.270]  That's right.
[01:39:11.529 --> 01:39:17.489]  So you do want the woman who's being viciously, physically abused to leave her abusive boyfriend.
[01:39:17.649 --> 01:39:19.789]  But she should do it when he's at work.
[01:39:20.029 --> 01:39:20.430]  Exactly.
[01:39:20.710 --> 01:39:21.109]  Exactly.
[01:39:21.369 --> 01:39:21.850]  Well said.
[01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:29.149]  Well, that's why Trump's got to come in, like you said, and basically fire 20 deep immediately to decapitate, then go in and look and then do an assessment.
[01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:33.510]  And this is why it's so important that he won a landslide.
[01:39:33.670 --> 01:39:37.930]  Like, if he had just eked out a victory, that probably wouldn't have been enough.
[01:39:37.930 --> 01:39:45.449]  Because what you need is to kind of, like, take out the top people and then let everybody at the middle and bottom know, it's over.
[01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:46.829]  You've already lost.
[01:39:47.039 --> 01:39:50.880]  The entire country is behind this guy doing what he's doing right now.
[01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:53.460]  And then, look, this is what happened with the Soviet Union.
[01:39:53.659 --> 01:40:05.300]  There were people at the highest level of the Soviet Union, when the nation started to split apart and the things started to dissolve, who wanted to violently put down these movements and centralize the Soviet Union.
[01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:11.460]  And eventually, there were just so many people who didn't want to do it that they were like, we can't win this fight, and they let them go peacefully.
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:12.500]  That's what we need.
[01:40:13.369 --> 01:40:14.510]  Dave, this is so good.
[01:40:14.689 --> 01:40:16.130]  I was meaning to do this today intensely.
[01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:23.609]  I did it some yesterday, but you were just nailing it better than I could because people that haven't read hundreds of history books or studied things, which I've done, you've obviously done that.
[01:40:23.909 --> 01:40:25.050]  This is how it works.
[01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:30.449]  So the bad guys have got to be like Brennan, Clapper, that have been running this behind the scenes with Obama.
[01:40:30.649 --> 01:40:37.810]  They've got to get in some trouble, but we've got to have some type of program to reach out to people, or this fight's going to go on forever.
[01:40:38.050 --> 01:40:46.250]  And Lincoln knew that and was going to fix things, but a bunch of folks in his cabinet wanted the war to continue, wanted to loot the South, so they kind of stepped aside, let him get killed.
[01:40:46.289 --> 01:40:49.810]  This has come out in the history books, and then it created 100 years of problems in the South.
[01:40:50.649 --> 01:40:51.970]  It's going to be much worse this time.
[01:40:52.050 --> 01:40:52.609]  We've got...
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:54.960]  And Trump's starting to do this.
[01:40:55.039 --> 01:41:01.000]  We've got to develop some plan to remove the bad guys, but then have some type of cultural amnesty.
[01:41:01.199 --> 01:41:01.560]  That's right.
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:11.479]  And look, when you see the corporate media for the last six months or so, and they're all freaking out about how Donald Trump's going to prosecute his political enemies.
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:14.840]  And the first thing all of us think, obviously, is...
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:19.159]  How hypocritical and ridiculous, because that's exactly what they're doing to Donald Trump.
[01:41:19.359 --> 01:41:29.939]  But there's also something, when you listen to these guys, they give the game away in a little bit, because they actually are concerned that Donald Trump might come in and try to prosecute some of these criminals.
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:33.220]  And if they completely give up- It will go a lot easier on them.
[01:41:33.439 --> 01:41:34.300]  I mean, that's how this works.
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:37.939]  If you just give up, we've got to put your kingpins in jail.
[01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:38.439]  It's the right thing to do.
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:39.420]  We've got to find the missing kids.
[01:41:39.699 --> 01:41:40.800]  But we understand.
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:42.260]  We just want to win and get this over with.
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:43.420]  We just want prosperity and security.
[01:41:43.579 --> 01:41:48.060]  So I'm just telling you, seriously, roll over, signal, and then we'll move past you.
[01:41:48.159 --> 01:41:50.800]  But there's going to be people that don't give up, and it's not going to go well.
[01:41:50.899 --> 01:41:51.640]  We're fully committed.
[01:41:51.859 --> 01:41:53.079]  As I told you, we're not going to stop.
[01:41:53.319 --> 01:42:01.140]  Yeah, well, you know, you think about it like, look, if one little guy, say you're walking down the street with your wife, and one little guy comes up to you and goes, give me your wallet.
[01:42:01.479 --> 01:42:03.399]  You're like, I'm gonna knock this guy out.
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:09.340]  But if five guys come up to you with guns by their side, and they go, give me your wallet...
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:22.079]  Probably gonna go like, alright, now, if you in your mind think that these five guys with guns are gonna assault your wife, you'll probably go out fighting and die.
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:29.960]  But if you know that you can just give them your wallet and then you and your wife can move along safely, you're just gonna give them your wallet because that's the same.
[01:42:30.079 --> 01:42:34.899]  So you have to kind of in some way, and I'm not- No, no, we gotta say, hey, we won fair and square.
[01:42:35.159 --> 01:42:36.340]  You know you're gonna lose.
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:39.779]  Give us the keys and you can move on.
[01:42:39.899 --> 01:42:40.239]  That's right.
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:42.239]  You have to somehow create that.
[01:42:42.239 --> 01:42:44.119]  That's what George Washington did after the war here.
[01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:44.600]  He did the same thing.
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:44.779]  Right.
[01:42:45.199 --> 01:42:47.119]  And so this is the moment.
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:49.220]  This is 2024.
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:52.579]  This is our 1776 moment.
[01:42:52.819 --> 01:43:06.140]  This could be, at least it has the potential to be, a great moment in the history of the United States of America where we reclaim the republic and we return to prosperity and morality and all of these things.
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:08.220]  But it's got to be handled well.
[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:09.619]  And I want to say this to the establishment.
[01:43:10.319 --> 01:43:13.500]  People have been serving evil just because they followed orders, want their pension or whatever.
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:15.439]  Look at the establishment now.
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:18.939]  World War III, open borders, human trafficking, total brainwashing.
[01:43:19.359 --> 01:43:20.659]  They're out of control.
[01:43:21.619 --> 01:43:23.359]  They're the danger to you.
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:26.720]  I mean, you ought to be glad we're here taking the keys away from the drunk.
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:27.260]  I mean...
[01:43:27.799 --> 01:43:28.319]  100%.
[01:43:28.319 --> 01:43:37.079]  And I think a lot of people are waking up to the idea that at a certain point, it's risky to fight the establishment.
[01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:39.420]  You know personally better than most people.
[01:43:39.619 --> 01:43:42.079]  But at a certain point, it's also risky not to.
[01:43:42.279 --> 01:43:44.960]  And we're way past that point.
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:56.720]  If we don't control our borders right now, if we don't rein in the war machine, if we don't rein in government spending and debt, this nation is going to collapse.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:57.340]  Very soon.
[01:43:57.439 --> 01:43:57.619]  Yeah.
[01:43:57.710 --> 01:44:01.329]  I mean, they're adding trillions a week now, and it was trillions a year before.
[01:44:02.199 --> 01:44:03.279]  So it's existential.
[01:44:03.279 --> 01:44:04.600]  And people can feel it.
[01:44:04.699 --> 01:44:05.319]  They can see it.
[01:44:05.399 --> 01:44:07.140]  If they're informed, they know it intellectually.
[01:44:08.239 --> 01:44:11.260]  We're not here saying some weird calculation.
[01:44:11.399 --> 01:44:11.880]  We're not sure what's right.
[01:44:11.979 --> 01:44:12.960]  It's like 1 plus 1 equals 2.
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:13.880]  This is guaranteed.
[01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:18.239]  And this is a crazy thing about today's day and age.
[01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:24.239]  At the same time, while there are all of these very real dangers, we have these wonders.
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:32.579]  Firstborn.
[01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:36.800]  If I had had him 30 years ago, I'd just lost my child.
[01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:40.279]  But now the amazing things these doctors can do, they just repair his heart.
[01:44:40.279 --> 01:44:40.800]  He's fine.
[01:44:40.899 --> 01:44:42.000]  He's living a totally great life.
[01:44:42.180 --> 01:44:44.279]  We have these wonders all around us.
[01:44:44.279 --> 01:44:44.279]  Beautiful.
[01:44:44.479 --> 01:44:45.560]  And we can't, you know what I mean?
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:47.420]  Like, we can live in this great world.
[01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:50.640]  We've got to believe there's good because there is, and we've got to celebrate it and defend it.
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:51.359]  That's right.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:55.579]  And so the threats are very real, but we also live in a great time to be alive.
[01:44:55.859 --> 01:45:00.880]  And the truth is that the struggles that we go through right now are...
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:04.899]  Men have been through much worse in the history of mankind.
[01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:11.920]  I was about to say, I've been through a lot, Trump's with a lot of others, but compared to past struggles for freedom, this is a cakewalk.
[01:45:12.039 --> 01:45:12.579]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:45:12.859 --> 01:45:18.779]  I mean, you know, like I mentioned Ludwig von Mises before, he was a great, in my opinion, the greatest economist who's ever lived.
[01:45:19.370 --> 01:45:26.510]  He was a refugee from World War II and he had his library burned and he had to flee to escape.
[01:45:26.850 --> 01:45:32.149]  And then he came to a country where he didn't speak the language and then he learned the language and then he published books in this language.
[01:45:32.369 --> 01:45:37.670]  There's just so many people like this who went through like enormous things and kept fighting for liberty.
[01:45:38.090 --> 01:45:46.130]  And so then you kind of look around at yourself and you go like, okay, well, if those guys could go through that and keep fighting for a free society, then we got to do the same.
[01:45:46.570 --> 01:45:48.069]  We're going to go to break in a few minutes.
[01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:49.090]  You've got to come back more often.
[01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.630]  This is great.
[01:45:49.710 --> 01:45:53.390]  I'm so glad you're here to ask producers before, but we finally got you this time.
[01:45:54.609 --> 01:45:56.670]  I want to come back out of the break.
[01:45:56.989 --> 01:45:59.250]  It's a short little segment coming up, and we have some longer segments.
[01:45:59.609 --> 01:46:02.970]  I want to come back and play that two-and-a-half-minute compilation of the freakouts.
[01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:05.010]  And when I put this out here, I said, is it right to laugh?
[01:46:05.010 --> 01:46:08.729]  And I went on in another video and on the show to say...
[01:46:09.159 --> 01:46:12.420]  Look, I get it, and we deserve some entertainment, okay?
[01:46:12.699 --> 01:46:19.619]  But when you think about the serious mental illness that these people have been induced into, these are victims.
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:24.699]  And really, it's not right to make fun of a mentally ill person, though I do do it myself.
[01:46:24.699 --> 01:46:25.619]  I'm not a hypocrite.
[01:46:25.699 --> 01:46:26.340]  I like it.
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:27.760]  But it's sick.
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:30.960]  If we don't reach some point...
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:32.119]  In fact, let's go ahead and play it now.
[01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:34.880]  We'll go to break, come back and get your take on this.
[01:46:35.239 --> 01:46:36.300]  But here it is.
[01:46:36.399 --> 01:46:38.260]  Then we'll start the third hour.
[01:46:38.619 --> 01:46:39.340]  Dave Smith's here.
[01:46:39.979 --> 01:46:42.739]  ComicDaveSmith.com on X at Comic Dave Smith.
[01:46:42.779 --> 01:46:45.000]  I watch his podcast all the time, especially on road trips.
[01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:47.819]  And it's just awesome to have him here with us.
[01:46:48.119 --> 01:46:49.039]  Hour number three coming up.
[01:46:49.119 --> 01:46:50.199]  He'll be gone in about 35 minutes.
[01:46:50.359 --> 01:46:51.300]  And then we'll take your calls.
[01:46:51.359 --> 01:46:54.560]  Got a bunch of other news and analysis and what Trump needs to do to stop the globalists.
[01:47:03.489 --> 01:47:05.510]  How did we get here?
[01:47:07.050 --> 01:47:08.770]  How did we get here?
[01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:13.470]  What in the Alice in Wonderland nightmares is going on right now?
[01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:17.789]  All I can say is how dare you.
[01:47:18.369 --> 01:47:27.829]  If you voted for that man, if you voted for anybody other than Kamala, and you live in one of the states, that it was close.
[01:47:29.069 --> 01:47:31.689]  Or if you didn't vote, you.
[01:47:32.770 --> 01:47:34.310]  Go to the Senate race.
[01:47:34.449 --> 01:47:35.390]  It's not gonna happen.
[01:47:36.449 --> 01:47:37.390]  Go Kamala.
[01:47:39.779 --> 01:47:40.899]  I chose family.
[01:47:41.159 --> 01:47:42.020]  I chose women.
[01:47:42.260 --> 01:47:43.380]  I chose America.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:45.000]  I love you.
[01:47:45.279 --> 01:47:47.500]  How the is this still happening?
[01:47:47.859 --> 01:47:51.039]  All I've ever known politically is hatred.
[01:47:51.539 --> 01:47:51.960]  I'm done.
[01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:53.359]  I'm done.
[01:47:53.579 --> 01:47:54.140]  I'm done.
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:56.159]  I'm done with you.
[01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:59.539]  I'm done with you and your mother and your sister.
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:02.100]  I'm just done with all of this.
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:10.579]  I'm sorry to all my friends who are troll supporters.
[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:14.439]  I don't understand how scared of this man I am.
[01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:21.899]  If this guy does end up winning again, all of the people who voted for him will be happy and he'll just be celebrating.
[01:48:22.279 --> 01:48:26.539]  And everyone else, everyone who feels threatened by him is fucking scared.
[01:48:27.579 --> 01:48:30.460]  We're scared for our lives, we're scared for our friends.
[01:48:30.619 --> 01:48:40.140]  How dare you put this man into office for another four years knowing damn well what it means for our country, what it means for us as a people.
[01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:47.750]  To know that there is that much ignorance and that much hate in this country, it's so terrifying.
[01:48:48.810 --> 01:48:50.250]  It's so terrifying.
[01:48:50.949 --> 01:48:54.770]  How the are we back in this same situation again?
[01:48:56.989 --> 01:48:59.909]  Who the is voting for him?
[01:49:00.489 --> 01:49:01.130]  Genuinely.
[01:49:01.930 --> 01:49:05.270]  you, I don't want to hear about how shitty your life gets under his policies.
[01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:11.640]  Live with that decision.
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:12.539]  Sit with it.
[01:49:12.739 --> 01:49:14.300]  Let it make you uncomfortable.
[01:49:16.039 --> 01:49:16.520]  you.
[01:49:24.119 --> 01:49:25.340]  They're coming after everybody.
[01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:26.300]  They're coming after Trump.
[01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:27.159]  They're coming after Kennedy.
[01:49:27.439 --> 01:49:28.260]  We need your support.
[01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:29.279]  And you don't even come here and do this.
[01:49:29.479 --> 01:49:30.720]  Alex, first of all, I want to thank you.
[01:49:30.819 --> 01:49:31.800]  Give to Alex Jones.
[01:49:31.979 --> 01:49:37.159]  I don't want this guy to have to be like wearing a symbol and we're all going to say, you know, the truth teller formerly known as Alex Jones.
[01:49:37.279 --> 01:49:38.439]  Let's not let that happen.
[01:49:38.739 --> 01:49:40.180]  Well, they're trying to make an example out of me.
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:43.180]  I'm not that important, but I've become a rallying point.
[01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:45.520]  I've become like a Roman standard they want to capture.
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:46.199]  Explain that.
[01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:46.600]  You're...
[01:49:46.699 --> 01:49:55.640]  Look, I mean, if we don't have freedom of speech, if you don't have the First Amendment, if, you know, media, which is, look, it never said only newspapers or the media.
[01:49:55.779 --> 01:50:04.659]  It was anyone that wants to challenge government, anyone that's willing to put the feet to the fire of corporate interests of your government, that is supposed to be free.
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:05.819]  Electronic soapbox.
[01:50:06.090 --> 01:50:10.050]  In the end, if you lose, Alex, we all lose.
[01:50:10.170 --> 01:50:16.029]  We will all lose the ability to do tough stories, to take risks, to plant flags where we think there's an issue.
[01:50:16.210 --> 01:50:17.289]  Sometime we'll get it wrong.
[01:50:17.449 --> 01:50:19.350]  I said before, you do a daily show.
[01:50:19.489 --> 01:50:21.250]  It's impossible to nail that to the wall.
[01:50:21.329 --> 01:50:22.289]  I do a weekly show.
[01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:23.829]  I spend more time vetting it.
[01:50:23.949 --> 01:50:24.810]  They're two different animals.
[01:50:24.949 --> 01:50:25.970]  They can't be compared to each other.
[01:50:25.970 --> 01:50:27.350]  They also take stuff out of context.
[01:50:27.489 --> 01:50:27.970]  I'm exaggerating.
[01:50:28.229 --> 01:50:29.329]  Absolutely, that's true.
[01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:37.979]  You know, one of the things that makes you so spectacular, Alex, is long before any of us were here, You were starting to talk about this deep state.
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:49.560]  You were talking about this, you know, a government that was supposed to be of, for and by the people that was being robbed from us by corporate interests, by special interests, by globalists, long before anybody else ever did.
[01:50:50.109 --> 01:50:55.069]  And to imagine you sitting here in this moment, we are in that impactful moment.
[01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:57.350]  And in many ways, not enough people are listening to you.
[01:50:57.529 --> 01:51:12.869]  And I want to say that, you know, I think the vaccine, and we've talked about this before, that was the tip of the spear of the final death blow, which was, if we can inject you and own your bodies, and own the bodies of your children, and pass laws that say that, you know, because of vaccinations,
[01:51:12.869 --> 01:51:15.930]  we've decided that we own your children, we make your decisions.
[01:51:15.930 --> 01:51:17.369]  That's a revolutionary takeover.
[01:51:17.399 --> 01:51:21.560]  It was a revolutionary takeover, and so people like me got alarmed by that.
[01:51:21.739 --> 01:51:26.159]  And we joined forces with people like you that have been really talking about it for a long time.
[01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:29.220]  But I would say that we're at the very last stage.
[01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:33.319]  I was just speaking publicly, and this woman said, things don't happen that fast, Dale.
[01:51:33.439 --> 01:51:34.300]  You're being really dramatic.
[01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:36.659]  I don't think this election matters that much.
[01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:41.220]  I was like, that's because you're looking at this over the last year, maybe two years.
[01:51:41.399 --> 01:51:44.640]  There's people like Bobby that's been fighting the corporate establishment for 40 years.
[01:51:56.569 --> 01:52:06.670]  We're really at the end stage of a takeover and destruction of the one thing that stands in the way of globalist thinking, which is the Constitution of the United States of America.
[01:52:06.909 --> 01:52:08.909]  They're doing all these lawsuits trying to take my name.
[01:52:09.010 --> 01:52:09.729]  People say they can't do that.
[01:52:09.850 --> 01:52:10.710]  Well, I got to defend those.
[01:52:10.850 --> 01:52:11.510]  We're going to win.
[01:52:11.649 --> 01:52:12.109]  We're already winning.
[01:52:12.210 --> 01:52:13.289]  The judge shut them down last week.
[01:52:13.409 --> 01:52:17.270]  That took high-powered lawyers and that, you know, 50 grand right there to have those briefs ready, okay?
[01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:18.569]  This is total war.
[01:52:18.770 --> 01:52:19.590]  We make it easy.
[01:52:19.689 --> 01:52:21.789]  Great supplements, great t-shirts, great everything.
[01:52:22.090 --> 01:52:23.750]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:52:23.810 --> 01:52:24.649]  Come a VIP member.
[01:52:24.670 --> 01:52:25.729]  You get 40 bucks free a month.
[01:52:25.850 --> 01:52:27.350]  For 30 bucks, you make 10 bucks on that.
[01:52:28.329 --> 01:52:49.649]  We're good to go.
[01:52:52.180 --> 01:53:04.180]  We're good to go.
[01:53:06.460 --> 01:53:08.500]  But I need funds to fight a war.
[01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:09.979]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[01:53:10.779 --> 01:53:11.600]  DrJonesNationals.com.
[01:53:11.819 --> 01:53:13.760]  Those are the coordinates of the resistance.
[01:53:14.119 --> 01:53:22.000]  It's all there, and it's great products, at great prices, highest quality, and it funds the fight against the New World Order that's coming down on us with both damn feet.
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:23.899]  But at least we're in the fight, and we're starting to win.
[01:53:24.399 --> 01:53:25.539]  Dave Smith's in studio.
[01:53:25.699 --> 01:53:28.500]  Incredible comedian, podcaster, comic Dave Smith on X-Comic.
[01:53:29.210 --> 01:53:29.930]  DavidSmith.com.
[01:53:30.149 --> 01:53:34.630]  This is a short segment about hundreds of stations joining us at 6 after, but you just saw that clip.
[01:53:35.010 --> 01:53:37.710]  We posted two versions of it, 100 million views on X yesterday.
[01:53:38.229 --> 01:53:45.590]  And I asked in the second video I posted where I responded, I said, basically what you said, but you said it more eloquently, this is a problem we've got.
[01:53:45.689 --> 01:53:48.130]  I mean, what do you see in those videos?
[01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:50.229]  Yeah, well, I see mentally ill people.
[01:53:50.489 --> 01:53:53.949]  And, you know, look, again, I feel exactly like you said.
[01:53:54.090 --> 01:53:56.010]  I'm not, like, saying I'm better than any of you guys.
[01:53:56.010 --> 01:53:56.930]  I'm guilty of it, too.
[01:53:57.369 --> 01:53:58.810]  I've laughed at this stuff.
[01:53:59.310 --> 01:54:04.829]  It's like when you see, like, a really bratty kid, you know, and you're just like, oh, my God, this kid is the worst.
[01:54:04.909 --> 01:54:07.390]  Then you realize his parents are really bad parents.
[01:54:07.869 --> 01:54:09.869]  That's what I said is these are grown toddlers.
[01:54:10.050 --> 01:54:10.649]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:12.649]  And, look, a lot of them are...
[01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:23.470]  They are victims of this system, this really cruel system that has broken up families and put kids on medication and got them into this college trap.
[01:54:23.470 --> 01:54:24.670]  Oh, you know they're all on project.
[01:54:24.810 --> 01:54:25.609]  Oh, 100%.
[01:54:25.609 --> 01:54:36.609]  And it got them into this racket that is higher education in America, where you're basically going into 100 grand of debt so they can fill your head with socialist nonsense.
[01:54:36.989 --> 01:54:38.850]  And again, I'm not...
[01:54:39.210 --> 01:54:40.970]  I understand the impulse to laugh at them.
[01:54:41.090 --> 01:54:44.710]  I'm sure that these people, if you were down, would be very nasty to you.
[01:54:45.329 --> 01:54:55.890]  But I do think at a certain point, if we're ever going to get out of this cycle, we do have to recognize that a lot of these people are victims, and it's horrible what's happened to them.
[01:54:56.029 --> 01:54:58.869]  And yes, they need professional help, and I don't know if they are going to get it.
[01:54:58.869 --> 01:55:03.029]  And they have Stockholm Syndrome, so let me ask you, smart guy, how would you reach out to one of them?
[01:55:04.199 --> 01:55:10.159]  You know, I think that it's almost, it is like, you know, Stockholm Syndrome, it's almost like being in a cult.
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:15.720]  I don't know exactly the best way, but it can't just be ridiculing them.
[01:55:15.899 --> 01:55:23.359]  At some point, what we have to do, I think the best thing to do is to try to attack the system that creates people like this.
[01:55:23.359 --> 01:55:23.439]  Exactly.
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:25.699]  And turn off the brainwashing machine.
[01:55:25.890 --> 01:55:35.590]  Yeah, well, I mean, first of all, we have to have, and this is why, and I don't agree with him on everything, but this is why I'm very excited at the prospect of Bobby Kennedy being involved in this administration.
[01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:45.649]  In terms of health, and this is mental health, physical health, all of it, what we have done to our children is disgusting.
[01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:48.529]  And we need to...
[01:55:48.529 --> 01:55:50.869]  They've been medicalized and institutionalized.
[01:55:50.949 --> 01:55:51.250]  That's right.
[01:55:51.369 --> 01:55:52.909]  And we need to stop doing that.
[01:55:53.029 --> 01:55:58.810]  And I don't exactly know what the path toward that is, but we need to stop putting kids on all of these drugs.
[01:55:59.010 --> 01:56:05.109]  We need to end the policies that are breaking up families, and we've got a lot of them, by the way, in I think inflation is a major factor in that.
[01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:14.189]  You know, people sometimes get, like Ron Paul used to always say, people act like you have economic issues over here and social issues over here, but really they're all one and the same.
[01:56:14.369 --> 01:56:18.310]  I mean, what do you think it is when the price of housing and groceries becomes unaffordable?
[01:56:23.099 --> 01:56:25.039]  We're good to go.
[01:56:26.020 --> 01:56:27.899]  We're good to go.
[01:56:48.239 --> 01:56:55.960]  It is crazy because they also know they're victims, but then they act like we're the ones victimizing them because we're not in their cult.
[01:56:56.239 --> 01:56:58.439]  And so they set the cameras up and then flip out.
[01:56:58.579 --> 01:57:01.859]  It's almost performance art, but they're believing it as well.
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:05.079]  And it's almost just laugh with them and say, come on, you know it's not that bad.
[01:57:05.239 --> 01:57:06.819]  Why is Tulsi Gabbard and RFK Jr.
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:07.520]  endorsing Trump?
[01:57:09.029 --> 01:57:18.109]  You know the Ukraine war is insane, World War III, but the problem is they have such a limited base of knowledge about the economy and the world that it's like you're trying to talk to Helen Keller.
[01:57:18.829 --> 01:57:20.550]  They're intellectually deaf, dumb, and blind.
[01:57:20.949 --> 01:57:36.560]  Yeah, well, I mean, look, a lot of this is the fact that The government control, you know, they go to government schools from kindergarten through 12th grade, and then they go to universities, which are essentially, if they're not government schools,
[01:57:36.699 --> 01:57:39.100]  it's all a big government scheme anyway.
[01:57:39.359 --> 01:57:51.119]  And so I would say, you know, we want to have a mass movement of pulling people out, pulling their kids out of government schools, homeschooling, or send them to a good school that has your values.
[01:57:51.819 --> 01:57:58.000]  A peaceful cultural revolution, basically, of an intervention from the system.
[01:57:58.220 --> 01:57:58.899]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:06.979]  And I would love if Donald Trump would try to go after the funding for some of these universities.
[01:58:06.979 --> 01:58:07.279]  I agree.
[01:58:07.359 --> 01:58:08.619]  Dave Smith, stay there back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:09.140 --> 01:58:10.380]  Headed on the highway!
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:13.439]  Oh, we got adventure now.
[01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:17.020]  And whatever comes our way.
[01:58:18.079 --> 01:58:21.300]  I don't want to hear anybody tell me this is an exciting time to be alive.
[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:24.399]  Reality is the real TV program.
[01:58:25.079 --> 01:58:29.779]  So many opportunities and good just exploding, rising, the great awakening.
[01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:31.539]  Humanity has the initiative.
[01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:32.720]  The good guys have the initiative.
[01:58:32.859 --> 01:58:33.460]  It's not just here.
[01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:35.600]  Populists are getting elected everywhere.
[01:58:35.979 --> 01:58:42.659]  And you see Yuval Noah Harari and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Tedros at the UN, and they are just saying, we are screwed.
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:50.329]  The head of the PR program three months ago, James O'Keefe got an undercover video of him, the global head of UN We're a criminal organization.
[01:58:51.270 --> 01:58:54.489]  We've committed all these crimes, human trafficking, just total corruption.
[01:58:55.010 --> 01:58:56.449]  They're going to throw us all in prison.
[01:58:57.250 --> 01:58:59.550]  Yeah, they know they're the baddies.
[01:58:59.729 --> 01:59:04.229]  What was that show 20 years ago where it's the Nazis and they're sitting there going on the Eastern Front?
[01:59:04.289 --> 01:59:05.630]  They go, what if we're the baddies?
[01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:10.819]  I forget what show that is, but we've really reached that point here, and it's a tipping point.
[01:59:11.079 --> 01:59:13.340]  Now, how do we not screw this up, Dave Schmidt?
[01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:14.619]  We've kind of already talked about that.
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:16.939]  What do you think Trump's main goal should be?
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:18.760]  That we need to keep him alive.
[01:59:19.079 --> 01:59:20.720]  He needs to get good people in.
[01:59:21.079 --> 01:59:22.539]  He's got to prosecute the bad guys.
[01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:23.479]  That's just justice.
[01:59:23.479 --> 01:59:26.939]  He's got to get them off balance, but also amnesty for the lower-level people.
[01:59:27.239 --> 01:59:28.060]  You're a smart guy.
[01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:29.739]  What else do you see happening?
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:37.180]  More hearings, expose big tech and the censorship, because only X is the only one not doing it, other than shows like this and Rumble.
[01:59:37.439 --> 01:59:39.039]  I mean, there's a lot to do.
[01:59:39.199 --> 01:59:46.140]  How could we squander this explosion of liberty and the greatest opportunity, really, in modern history?
[01:59:46.399 --> 01:59:56.680]  Okay, so, well, my biggest concern is that Donald Trump, at his last rally before the election, had Mike Pompeo speaking there.
[01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:01.899]  And Mike Pompeo bragging about how he's the most loyal one to Donald Trump.
[02:00:02.060 --> 02:00:04.880]  And look, this was always the weakness of Donald Trump, right?
[02:00:05.039 --> 02:00:08.420]  And this is something critics and supporters alike have acknowledged.
[02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:13.340]  And look, he's a human being, you know, and Donald Trump is very subject to flattery.
[02:00:13.439 --> 02:00:22.779]  And so if somebody comes along like a Mike Pompeo and starts telling him he's the greatest thing in the world and he's such an amazing leader, Donald Trump has a tendency to say, I like that guy.
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:24.039]  And Pompeo worked.
[02:00:24.199 --> 02:00:25.699]  I know you know this stuff, so tell people.
[02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:28.079]  He worked against Trump and the CIA the whole time.
[02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:31.560]  He's a neocon just as bad as Netanyahu.
[02:00:31.779 --> 02:00:37.039]  Trump needs to keep Nikki Haley and him and John Bolton and Ron Paul's been warning of this far away.
[02:00:37.279 --> 02:00:38.420]  And Trump will listen to us.
[02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:40.720]  So absolutely, that was scary.
[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:42.159]  We put out some reports on that.
[02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:43.340]  That was dangerous.
[02:00:43.579 --> 02:00:46.180]  And Trump does have some serious issues.
[02:00:46.210 --> 02:00:49.329]  We're good to go.
[02:00:52.010 --> 02:01:06.489]  We're good to go.
[02:01:06.949 --> 02:01:07.430]  Well, it is.
[02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:08.210]  Right, exactly.
[02:01:10.010 --> 02:01:13.970]  It's funny how they use the Nazi thing for Donald Trump.
[02:01:14.090 --> 02:01:15.029]  They always call him a Nazi.
[02:01:15.149 --> 02:01:17.970]  And as you know, all these guys are Nazis.
[02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:37.560]  I mean, if Barack Obama is, from the perspective of Libya or Syria or Yemen, he's there, Adolf Hitler, responsible for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, Well, as you know, the neocons that still run the Democrat foreign policy are Straussians from the Chicago Business School.
[02:01:37.979 --> 02:01:44.460]  They actually embrace totalitarian Hitler-like ideology, but not from an Aryan perspective.
[02:01:44.739 --> 02:01:45.300]  Yeah, well, that's right.
[02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:52.960]  But look, if you add up the death toll from the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia...
[02:01:53.449 --> 02:01:54.390]  You're in the millions.
[02:01:54.930 --> 02:01:57.510]  Millions of innocent people have been slaughtered in these wars.
[02:01:57.810 --> 02:02:03.489]  And look, Donald Trump in his last administration was responsible for a lot of that stuff too.
[02:02:03.949 --> 02:02:09.729]  And he fell for the Assad fake chemical gas attacks.
[02:02:10.039 --> 02:02:19.859]  And he, you know, look, he made mistakes, he put the wrong people around him, and that's, so to me right now, like from now to January 20th, that's the big game.
[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:35.819]  And we needed everybody, and you're one of the major voices in this, and all of the people who are good, who have some influence with Donald Trump, need to be trying to keep this monster, Liz Cheney's pick for defense secretary, as far away from the cabinet, as far away from the administration as possible.
[02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:36.539]  Well, that's right.
[02:02:36.859 --> 02:02:42.340]  Pompeo, if you describe him as one person, he's Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld rolled all into one.
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:44.420]  And look, they're all the same, right?
[02:02:44.579 --> 02:02:50.579]  And this was the thing that I think people woke up to about the pre-Trump political dynamic in America.
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:51.600]  Is that...
[02:02:51.859 --> 02:02:53.100]  It's a uniparty, right?
[02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:56.279]  There's no difference between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama.
[02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:59.680]  There's no difference between Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell.
[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:02.399]  I mean, maybe, like, the slightest little tinker.
[02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:04.699]  It's only over who gets to have power, but they agree on the same policies.
[02:03:04.779 --> 02:03:06.399]  And we saw that in this campaign.
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:13.239]  Why did the Democrats think, going, oh, we've got Liz Cheney endorsing us when she's hated by Democrats and Republicans.
[02:03:13.399 --> 02:03:15.899]  She's the most unpopular Republican in polls ever.
[02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:17.899]  She lost her race by the biggest...
[02:03:17.899 --> 02:03:19.340]  I mean, what were they thinking?
[02:03:19.739 --> 02:03:21.560]  Well, I mean, it's a good question.
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:31.359]  And I think that sometimes you see candidates and they're not actually playing to the voting base, they're playing to the power structure.
[02:03:31.619 --> 02:03:37.760]  So I think she was trying to signal to the military industrial complex that I'm your person.
[02:03:38.039 --> 02:03:40.119]  Look, I got Liz Cheney right here with me.
[02:03:40.220 --> 02:03:42.800]  I'm gonna be good for business for you, weapons companies.
[02:03:43.039 --> 02:03:47.000]  Now, obviously, this backfired, and she got blown out in the race.
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:48.779]  But that is the whole game.
[02:03:48.899 --> 02:04:03.710]  Look, when it comes to the most important issues, okay, which is war and peace, immigration, monetary policy, economic policies, all of these issues, There's no difference between the Republican and Democratic establishment.
[02:04:03.970 --> 02:04:08.449]  They may have a slight difference about some issue that doesn't mean anything to those in power.
[02:04:08.609 --> 02:04:15.689]  But when it comes to the issues that mean something for those in power, where do they stand on the CIA? Exactly the same.
[02:04:16.850 --> 02:04:21.329]  Now, Trump is actually different from the establishment Republicans and Democrats.
[02:04:21.710 --> 02:04:23.189]  Vivek Ramaswamy is different.
[02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:24.930]  J.D. Vance seems to be different.
[02:04:25.250 --> 02:04:26.289]  Bobby Kennedy is different.
[02:04:26.409 --> 02:04:27.470]  Tucker Carlson is different.
[02:04:27.829 --> 02:04:31.800]  So we want those people and the people that Elon Musk.
[02:04:32.199 --> 02:04:36.060]  And look, Donald Trump, you have great people who are allies of yours.
[02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:37.800]  Call Rand Paul.
[02:04:38.039 --> 02:04:39.220]  Call Ron Paul.
[02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:40.500]  Call Thomas Massey.
[02:04:41.199 --> 02:04:45.579]  Take advice from these people and don't call John Bolton.
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:51.739]  And so, by the way, he did defend having John Bolton as his national security advisor on the Joe Rogan podcast the other day.
[02:04:51.859 --> 02:04:58.819]  He kind of half-admitted he put some bad people in positions, and then also said that, like, well, it was kind of good to have this crazy John Bolton guy there.
[02:04:59.239 --> 02:05:00.500]  That's the wrong attitude.
[02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:02.720]  Keep that guy away from your administration.
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:07.420]  And there's much saying with you, I agree that we should not empower neocon warmongers.
[02:05:08.140 --> 02:05:09.680]  So let's speak to this.
[02:05:09.859 --> 02:05:13.680]  Why is the power structure so scared of Trump?
[02:05:14.439 --> 02:05:23.319]  Well, I think there's a few qualities to Donald Trump that I think scared the bejesus out of the establishment.
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:30.920]  One of them is that Donald Trump is, by his very nature, a boss.
[02:05:31.779 --> 02:05:33.600]  That's just what Donald Trump does.
[02:05:33.779 --> 02:05:35.819]  Donald Trump is the you're fired guy.
[02:05:36.060 --> 02:05:38.340]  He's the guy who ran great big companies.
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:49.399]  And when you run a multi-billion dollar company and you're the CEO of it, you're used to actually being the boss, being the person who makes the decisions.
[02:05:49.579 --> 02:05:50.800]  The buck stops with you.
[02:05:50.939 --> 02:05:53.420]  If you want to allocate resources here, then you do it.
[02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:55.720]  If you want to fire this person, then you do it.
[02:05:56.079 --> 02:06:03.369]  And one of the things, I know you know this stuff, Alex, but Presidents aren't really presidents.
[02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:06.590]  John F. Kennedy tried to really be president.
[02:06:07.229 --> 02:06:09.369]  Richard Nixon tried to really be president.
[02:06:09.670 --> 02:06:12.489]  And one of them got murdered and the other one got framed and removed.
[02:06:12.729 --> 02:06:19.409]  And so by the very nature of Donald Trump actually expecting to really be the president, I think that freaked them out.
[02:06:19.550 --> 02:06:21.829]  And then he's saying, I'm gonna drain the swamp.
[02:06:22.050 --> 02:06:26.149]  He's saying Obama created ISIS. He's saying all of these things.
[02:06:26.329 --> 02:06:28.149]  He was saying he was gonna lock up Hillary Clinton.
[02:06:28.270 --> 02:06:30.710]  And this freaked out all of them.
[02:06:30.869 --> 02:06:51.270]  The prospect that somebody with real popular support, with tens of millions of Americans who are loyal to them, coming in and actually believing that they are the executive, they are the commander in chief, and then very casually, and I gotta say, I don't know, but I think that Donald Trump didn't really understand No.
[02:07:09.770 --> 02:07:15.069]  Dave Smith, I mean, I've watched your podcast quite a bit, but I'm just saying I am super impressed.
[02:07:15.409 --> 02:07:19.689]  That is the, from my view, better said than I can put it, exactly right.
[02:07:19.989 --> 02:07:21.750]  That is 100% in.
[02:07:21.970 --> 02:07:37.149]  You have these bureaucracies and these agencies hooked into these big corporations, so they all have their own agendas, and That also lets them never be able to be blamed for the larger overall unified agenda because they can say,
[02:07:37.350 --> 02:07:38.409]  oh, we're compartmentalized.
[02:07:38.529 --> 02:07:43.550]  And that creates real danger of World War III and other disasters because none of them are really in charge.
[02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:48.170]  And that's why they didn't like Nixon because he was really the president and called the shots and was micromanaging things.
[02:07:48.489 --> 02:07:50.149]  And he was the most popular president in modern history.
[02:07:50.529 --> 02:07:52.890]  I mean, and it goes on and on.
[02:07:53.069 --> 02:08:00.970]  So they don't like Trump, even though he goes along with them some and makes mistakes and has blind spots, because when he comes in there, he's in charge.
[02:08:01.229 --> 02:08:07.850]  And the power structure wants to be in charge of their own thing, and it's really just a runaway train, because none of them have any accountability.
[02:08:07.850 --> 02:08:08.829]  They can just rob us.
[02:08:08.930 --> 02:08:11.670]  And that's why, with him...
[02:08:12.010 --> 02:08:13.569]  That they know he calls the shots.
[02:08:13.729 --> 02:08:18.050]  And at first he thought he could come in, turn the economy on, and all the corporations go, hey, we'll double your profits.
[02:08:18.130 --> 02:08:19.210]  You can still be in charge of your stuff.
[02:08:19.369 --> 02:08:20.489]  I just direct it.
[02:08:20.689 --> 02:08:23.390]  And it was about power and their control and their club.
[02:08:23.390 --> 02:08:24.930]  And they said, you've never been in our club.
[02:08:25.550 --> 02:08:26.810]  We're not going to let you have it.
[02:08:26.810 --> 02:08:31.010]  If you look at the bureaucrats in both parties, it's generational families like Blinken and all this.
[02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:35.229]  I mean, Obama, the CIA. And so they're like, dude, you're not in the club.
[02:08:35.529 --> 02:08:36.329]  We don't care.
[02:08:36.489 --> 02:08:37.430]  Yeah, we're mismanaging it.
[02:08:37.489 --> 02:08:39.909]  Yeah, we're driving it over the opposite cliff, but we're not going to let you.
[02:08:40.050 --> 02:08:41.489]  And so they hated him then.
[02:08:41.630 --> 02:08:42.710]  Now they've tried to kill him.
[02:08:42.989 --> 02:08:44.890]  Now Trump knows about the New World Order.
[02:08:44.970 --> 02:08:46.850]  Now Trump understands really how bad it is.
[02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:48.710]  Now he's really listening to me.
[02:08:48.850 --> 02:08:49.909]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[02:08:50.050 --> 02:08:51.590]  And really listening to RFK Jr.
[02:08:51.970 --> 02:08:53.289]  And really listening to Tucker Carlson.
[02:08:53.449 --> 02:08:55.510]  I'll leave it alone the phone calls I got yesterday.
[02:08:55.989 --> 02:08:59.189]  But I can tell you right now, we're in the driver's seat.
[02:08:59.609 --> 02:09:01.970]  And they're going to try to service an air missile, they're going to try to poison him.
[02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:05.069]  We're not out of the woods yet, but even if they do that, it'll blow up even bigger.
[02:09:05.210 --> 02:09:09.729]  So the power structure's going out unless they can have a nuclear war, which is a real danger.
[02:09:09.750 --> 02:09:12.550]  So I just want to say that that is dead on what's happening.
[02:09:12.550 --> 02:09:18.069]  The permanent, feckless, incompetent, insane, arrogant power structure's going down.
[02:09:18.109 --> 02:09:30.340]  I want to play the clip they found of Pompeo that doesn't get the traction it needs from a couple years ago, where he's on TV... On C-SPAN, but acting like the general public doesn't watch this, talking about how they lie to us and how we're a joke.
[02:09:30.439 --> 02:09:31.140]  And he would lie to Trump.
[02:09:31.460 --> 02:09:33.640]  Trump would sign executive orders and give directives.
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:35.020]  They'd throw it in the trash can.
[02:09:35.439 --> 02:09:35.720]  Okay?
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:37.279]  Remember, it was in AP and all that.
[02:09:37.399 --> 02:09:39.920]  Oh, General Kelly's main job is keeping Alex Jones away from Trump.
[02:09:39.979 --> 02:09:41.979]  Because I was talking to him, telling him, this person's a globalist.
[02:09:42.100 --> 02:09:43.380]  This person's on the Soros board.
[02:09:43.579 --> 02:09:44.500]  That's the person leaking.
[02:09:44.789 --> 02:09:47.109]  I could look at them and tell who was doing it and who was over what.
[02:09:47.489 --> 02:09:49.529]  That's when they turned the CIA and FBI loose on me.
[02:09:49.649 --> 02:09:51.229]  And people go, oh God, well you should back off.
[02:09:51.310 --> 02:09:57.770]  No, that's a badge of honor because they're not all powerful and people want security and freedom and justice and we're going to get it.
[02:09:57.850 --> 02:09:59.210]  But here's the Pompeo clip.
[02:10:00.289 --> 02:10:02.130]  I was the CIA director.
[02:10:02.270 --> 02:10:03.590]  We lied, we cheated, we stole.
[02:10:04.409 --> 02:10:08.989]  It was like, we had entire training courses.
[02:10:11.670 --> 02:10:12.489]  It, uh...
[02:10:14.410 --> 02:10:18.569]  It reminds you of the glory of the American experiment.
[02:10:19.130 --> 02:10:20.050]  So let's stop there.
[02:10:20.130 --> 02:10:22.229]  I have one more story and then you have the floor, but this is key.
[02:10:22.470 --> 02:10:23.890]  I forget who he was.
[02:10:25.050 --> 02:10:28.750]  There was a couple of them, but he was the main architect of Obamacare.
[02:10:29.689 --> 02:10:31.010]  It wasn't Rahm Emanuel's brother.
[02:10:31.109 --> 02:10:31.750]  He was the other one.
[02:10:32.369 --> 02:10:36.729]  I forget his name, but he went on C-SPAN. This is like 10 years ago.
[02:10:37.710 --> 02:10:43.189]  And he said, you know, I go to these government meetings and I teach them how to lie.
[02:10:44.170 --> 02:10:50.529]  And he said, we then create the packages to explain that Obamacare is going to make everything cheaper when we all knew it would triple the prices.
[02:10:50.649 --> 02:10:51.170]  Ha ha ha.
[02:10:51.390 --> 02:10:54.710]  And the insurance companies wrote it, but we acted like we were against the insurance companies.
[02:10:54.869 --> 02:11:02.609]  And they're all clapping as he's teaching them how to lie there, and they're saying it on TV. And then we got the clip, and it was in the news, and it was a big deal.
[02:11:02.670 --> 02:11:03.949]  But the point is, the...
[02:11:04.289 --> 02:11:09.069]  I used to read criminology when I was growing up, and I'd watch supervillains in movies and stuff and say, why do they brag?
[02:11:09.149 --> 02:11:09.949]  Why do they tell their plan?
[02:11:10.090 --> 02:11:11.470]  If I was a supervillain, I wouldn't do that.
[02:11:11.529 --> 02:11:12.109]  Well, I'm not a supervillain.
[02:11:12.310 --> 02:11:21.710]  It's part of criminology that they do all this covertly, but also tell you, like serial killers taunting the police with letters about, you can't stop me, I'm going to strike here next.
[02:11:21.890 --> 02:11:26.090]  And that's going to be their undoing because of this weird thing they do.
[02:11:26.149 --> 02:11:28.670]  And I'm kind of bringing a lot up there today, but what What do you make of that?
[02:11:28.770 --> 02:11:31.329]  No, there's something very interesting about that, and it is true.
[02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:38.489]  It's like serial killers in general almost always could get away with it if they didn't just get in their own way.
[02:11:39.289 --> 02:11:45.489]  But there is this weird human impulse, even in evil human beings, to confess.
[02:11:46.100 --> 02:11:48.880]  You know, it's like confessions, a big part of Catholicism.
[02:11:49.020 --> 02:11:51.619]  I mean, there's something very powerful about that idea.
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:54.739]  And Jews have the Day of Atonement with Yom Kippur.
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:58.699]  It's like very hardwired in us to confess sins.
[02:11:59.140 --> 02:12:00.899]  I like saying the bad stuff I've done.
[02:12:01.109 --> 02:12:01.390]  Yeah.
[02:12:01.470 --> 02:12:02.689]  I'm not proud of it, actually.
[02:12:02.890 --> 02:12:04.569]  Yeah, there's something about that.
[02:12:04.689 --> 02:12:10.170]  And so in a weird way, I'm kind of grateful for Mike Pompeo at least admitting it in that clip.
[02:12:10.689 --> 02:12:25.569]  But it is important for people to understand that, like, you know, when you have this view of history that, say, like, My grandfather, who had a hand in raising me, he fought in World War II. This is not that long ago.
[02:12:25.789 --> 02:12:30.869]  The CIA didn't exist until 1947, I believe, is when they were- National Security Act.
[02:12:30.970 --> 02:12:31.090]  Right.
[02:12:31.489 --> 02:12:38.029]  And so you have this control of the government is still a relatively new phenomenon.
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:43.060]  This is what's amazing about it, is that it doesn't have to be forever.
[02:12:43.220 --> 02:12:46.800]  And we've got them right here on tape admitting that they lie, cheat, and steal.
[02:12:46.939 --> 02:12:49.539]  And by the way, they're not just doing that to foreigners.
[02:12:49.899 --> 02:12:52.100]  They're doing that to the American people.
[02:12:52.140 --> 02:12:53.899]  And they have been from the very beginning.
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:58.260]  Oh, it's come out that, I mean, in court, the FBI and the CIA ran the attacks on me.
[02:12:58.399 --> 02:13:00.460]  But I knew it was all over the news, PR firms.
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:01.739]  I mean, they were testing it on me.
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:11.899]  Yeah, and I mean, listen, if you want to go through the declassified CIA documents of what they've done to the American people, I mean, experimenting on them, torturing them, all types of...
[02:13:11.899 --> 02:13:18.920]  They admitted the CIA and MI6 and the Canadian and the EU intelligence ran the COVID brainwashing and fear-mongering.
[02:13:19.390 --> 02:13:22.229]  Remember, they came out in the news and said later, yeah, we did it for your own good.
[02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:23.930]  We, quote, brainwashed you.
[02:13:24.229 --> 02:13:25.069]  Yeah, no, that's right.
[02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:32.510]  And the case for optimism here is that they were very, very good at it for many years.
[02:13:32.909 --> 02:13:35.010]  They are not nearly as good at it anymore.
[02:13:35.010 --> 02:13:37.609]  And I do think that COVID was a huge turning point.
[02:13:37.770 --> 02:13:45.390]  I think that it's probably going to be 10, 20 years before we even understand exactly what that did to damage the credibility of all of these institutions.
[02:13:45.390 --> 02:13:45.930]  Well, there's...
[02:13:45.970 --> 02:13:47.529]  There's that confession thing again.
[02:13:47.729 --> 02:13:48.649]  And they did it on purpose.
[02:13:48.909 --> 02:14:07.590]  The same week, about three years into it, when the lockdowns were ending, the same week, all the major papers, England, the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, all came out and said, our intelligence agencies, with our militaries, directed the doctors and the media to exaggerate it and scare you for your own good,
[02:14:07.609 --> 02:14:11.369]  and we're proud of it, and we're now involved, domestically targeting it, which has been going on forever.
[02:14:11.670 --> 02:14:14.010]  Obama, as you know, made it legal when it was illegal before.
[02:14:14.270 --> 02:14:14.689]  But...
[02:14:15.569 --> 02:14:19.850]  I mean, again, there they are trying to hide it in plain view that, yeah, we did this, but it's for your own good.
[02:14:20.550 --> 02:14:21.369]  It is crazy.
[02:14:21.689 --> 02:14:26.510]  Well, you know, look, if you think about, say, like, just take an example like the war in Iraq.
[02:14:26.729 --> 02:14:28.090]  They lied us into this war.
[02:14:28.329 --> 02:14:30.029]  Everybody knows they lied us into the war now.
[02:14:30.189 --> 02:14:34.449]  Nobody is even pretending that, like, there really were weapons of mass destruction or anything like that.
[02:14:34.550 --> 02:14:44.229]  But the reality is that The way the system has kind of worked out, okay, tens of thousands of soldiers committed suicide in the wake of these wars.
[02:14:44.430 --> 02:14:46.310]  It's horrific, it's really horrible.
[02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:49.670]  But it's tens of thousands in a country of hundreds of millions.
[02:14:50.710 --> 02:14:57.050]  Not that many Americans actually have to go to these wars that they lie us into, actually have to make these sacrifices.
[02:14:57.350 --> 02:15:00.550]  The difference with COVID is that it affected everybody.
[02:15:01.459 --> 02:15:07.720]  Almost everybody's life was in some way altered or affected by lockdowns and the COVID hysteria.
[02:15:07.859 --> 02:15:20.520]  And it was the official CIA, Carnegie Endowment, Rockefeller Foundation plan lockstep to bring in the world government, to bring in the global ID using a disease X. And so we are all veterans of this giant psyop.
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:25.020]  And nobody can deny that it was all based off lies.
[02:15:25.199 --> 02:15:26.020]  It was all ridiculous.
[02:15:26.439 --> 02:15:32.720]  I mean, my good friend of mine, Tom Woods, he's a brilliant historian.
[02:15:33.180 --> 02:15:39.180]  His last book is called Diary of a Psychosis, and it's all about the insanity of the COVID regime.
[02:15:39.479 --> 02:15:41.699]  And I mean, he goes through it so meticulously.
[02:15:41.739 --> 02:15:50.279]  If you look at every lockdown area versus the ones that didn't have lockdowns, if you look at the counties that had mass compliances versus the ones that didn't, there's no difference.
[02:15:50.590 --> 02:15:56.010]  It was the Democratic cult literally putting our kids in masks, shooting poison in us, locking us in our houses.
[02:15:56.010 --> 02:15:59.310]  It was an attempt, like when a woman's trying to leave an abusive husband, to keep us in the house.
[02:15:59.449 --> 02:16:16.149]  Yeah, and do you remember the picture that I think sums up the COVID regime and just American Politics better than anything else is Stacey Abrams with that, like, it's like a kindergarten or a first grade and all the kids are in masks and she doesn't have one on.
[02:16:16.489 --> 02:16:18.970]  And you're just watching this, like, this fat lady.
[02:16:19.289 --> 02:16:21.670]  She's the only one who doesn't have a mask on.
[02:16:21.770 --> 02:16:23.109]  She's the only one at risk.
[02:16:23.390 --> 02:16:28.829]  Stacey Abrams' photo with masked students and then people started pointing out everywhere else and they'd also get caught on hot mics.
[02:16:28.970 --> 02:16:30.350]  Hey, we wear this to scare them.
[02:16:30.829 --> 02:16:35.290]  Remember, they'd be walking on the stage in Australia here where they'd say, oh, don't forget to put your mask on.
[02:16:35.370 --> 02:16:37.979]  They put it on just for TV. I remember I had this moment.
[02:16:37.979 --> 02:16:39.540]  It always stuck with me.
[02:16:39.639 --> 02:16:45.719]  But I was on an airplane, and the woman next to me had a baby.
[02:16:46.319 --> 02:16:50.040]  And I got babies of my own, and I love little kids.
[02:16:50.420 --> 02:16:54.760]  This was at the height of COVID, where there were Nazis about wearing the mask on the airplane.
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:55.200]  You had to.
[02:16:55.299 --> 02:16:57.100]  And I remember just looking over and smiling.
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:17:01.020]  I made eye contact with a baby and just smiled, as you do when you make eye contact with a little kid.
[02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:02.260]  Just like, hey...
[02:17:03.610 --> 02:17:06.590]  And then I had this moment where I was like, oh, my face is covered.
[02:17:07.329 --> 02:17:11.569]  Like, even just like a baby can't see a smile on somebody's face.
[02:17:11.709 --> 02:17:13.149]  And they admit it really hurt them, and they knew that.
[02:17:13.209 --> 02:17:16.069]  Yeah, like how profoundly awful that is.
[02:17:16.489 --> 02:17:18.250]  A cult's put mask on people.
[02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:19.010]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:22.409]  By the way, they found the CNN article from like 10 years ago.
[02:17:22.469 --> 02:17:23.250]  Let's see, it was 10 years ago.
[02:17:23.489 --> 02:17:24.950]  Here's the guy that actually was the architect.
[02:17:25.459 --> 02:17:25.940]  Pull it up.
[02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:31.719]  And he bragged on television how he lied and how he taught the government and the media how to lie.
[02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:34.920]  They actually found it because he was the guy that actually architected how to lie.
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:35.979]  He just found it like three minutes ago.
[02:17:36.079 --> 02:17:37.180]  I want to show it because I forgot his name.
[02:17:37.299 --> 02:17:38.219]  I got obsessed on things like that.
[02:17:38.299 --> 02:17:38.899]  But there it is.
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:42.379]  Obamacare architect discusses misleading public on fourth newly uncovered video.
[02:17:42.799 --> 02:17:43.459]  Okay, scroll up.
[02:17:43.559 --> 02:17:44.420]  I've got to have his name.
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:45.479]  I'm kind of OCD about this.
[02:17:45.959 --> 02:17:47.379]  As Congress, what's his name?
[02:17:48.409 --> 02:17:49.590]  Jonathan Gruber, that's right.
[02:17:49.850 --> 02:17:52.030]  You gotta go watch those Jonathan Gruber clips.
[02:17:52.350 --> 02:17:54.049]  And again, there's so many of these.
[02:17:54.350 --> 02:17:55.729]  Oh, we're gonna triple the prices.
[02:17:55.870 --> 02:17:56.690]  We're gonna rip them off.
[02:17:56.770 --> 02:17:57.190]  Ha ha ha!
[02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:59.989]  And they're all laughing, a bunch of professors of communications.
[02:18:00.290 --> 02:18:00.870]  Well, in a way...
[02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:02.049]  I mean, what a bunch of dicks!
[02:18:02.170 --> 02:18:07.110]  Yeah, but it does make our job easier because it's kind of like, hey, you don't have to take our word for it.
[02:18:07.209 --> 02:18:09.250]  Like, here is the guy admitting it.
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:10.399]  This is the game.
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:11.780]  It's the old George Carlin.
[02:18:11.899 --> 02:18:13.540]  It's a big club and you ain't in it.
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:14.639]  This is their game.
[02:18:14.739 --> 02:18:16.659]  And they feel very entitled to this.
[02:18:16.799 --> 02:18:24.079]  You think about Hillary Clinton posting the picture of herself and congratulating herself on being a future president.
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:25.719]  Happy birthday to this future president.
[02:18:25.899 --> 02:18:29.040]  They feel very entitled to rule over us.
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:33.180]  Their mentality is that they rightfully get to rule over us.
[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:39.280]  But of course, the essence of the American experiment has always been that no, you freaking don't.
[02:18:39.379 --> 02:18:41.559]  You don't have a right to rule over people.
[02:18:41.739 --> 02:18:45.879]  So the greatest document in the history of the world is the Declaration of Independence.
[02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:48.459]  And it's just like, that's it.
[02:18:48.959 --> 02:18:50.520]  God wants us to be free.
[02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:52.399]  And we say that that's self-evident.
[02:18:52.540 --> 02:18:58.459]  Which, by the way, if you're really being literal and logical, it's not exactly self-evident.
[02:18:59.170 --> 02:19:00.809]  But screw you, we say it is.
[02:19:00.950 --> 02:19:03.450]  It's self-evident that we set the agenda, not you.
[02:19:03.610 --> 02:19:03.930]  That's right.
[02:19:04.190 --> 02:19:09.610]  And so that's what America represents, and hopefully that's what this moment in Trump's second term represents.
[02:19:09.829 --> 02:19:31.930]  I remember reading the articles 20-something years ago when she was really the president with We're good to go.
[02:19:33.219 --> 02:19:37.000]  And if they brought a dog in a check for bonds, you'll get that guy cussing like a sailor.
[02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:37.799]  Don't you look at me.
[02:19:37.899 --> 02:19:38.760]  You understand you're nobody.
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:40.540]  I mean, this is a monster.
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:44.379]  But I read in the papers, imagine acting like that.
[02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:46.819]  These are selfish, crazy monsters.
[02:19:47.239 --> 02:19:50.200]  Yeah, well, I mean, look, think about it like this.
[02:19:50.299 --> 02:19:54.819]  As a regular person, whoever's listening to this show, think about your life, okay?
[02:19:55.180 --> 02:20:02.620]  Hillary Clinton's husband, Bill Clinton, Has been accused of rape by how many women?
[02:20:03.399 --> 02:20:04.239]  I mean, like, how many?
[02:20:04.479 --> 02:20:04.860]  And he's at Epstein Island.
[02:20:05.100 --> 02:20:09.420]  Right, and he's, I believe he flew to Thailand with Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:20:09.659 --> 02:20:12.540]  Like, what are they doing in Thailand?
[02:20:12.760 --> 02:20:13.180]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:20:13.219 --> 02:20:14.120]  I know you gotta go to the airport.
[02:20:14.379 --> 02:20:15.180]  We're gonna go to break.
[02:20:15.319 --> 02:20:16.780]  Five more minutes, we'll play a clip, and you can go.
[02:20:17.100 --> 02:20:18.340]  Dave Smith, I am so impressed.
[02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:19.420]  I mean, I always watch you on Rogan.
[02:20:19.719 --> 02:20:20.399]  Rogan's dropped, right?
[02:20:20.479 --> 02:20:20.860]  Your interview with Rogan?
[02:20:20.860 --> 02:20:22.200]  I just dropped, just right now.
[02:20:22.299 --> 02:20:23.280]  We recorded yesterday, yeah.
[02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:24.840]  Well done, Lord Vader.
[02:20:25.540 --> 02:20:26.780]  All right, Dave Smith, very impressive.
[02:20:26.860 --> 02:20:28.059]  Alex Jones, we'll be back.
[02:20:28.420 --> 02:20:30.219]  Man, every time you come to us, please come in.
[02:20:30.340 --> 02:20:31.700]  I will hit you up every time I'm here.
[02:20:31.860 --> 02:20:33.139]  All right, we'll be right back, folks.
[02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:34.959]  And then I'm going to open the phones up, cover all the news.
[02:20:35.059 --> 02:20:35.579]  There's so much.
[02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:36.520]  Huge victory.
[02:20:36.659 --> 02:20:38.020]  I'm still just, I knew it was coming.
[02:20:38.139 --> 02:20:39.459]  I mean, I said, he's going to have a landslide.
[02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:40.120]  They'll try to steal it.
[02:20:40.299 --> 02:20:40.899]  That happened.
[02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:42.079]  We called it again.
[02:20:43.059 --> 02:20:46.280]  Infowars.com can be shut down next week, so be sure to follow me on X at Real Alex Jones.
[02:20:46.600 --> 02:20:48.399]  And we'll tell you a little bit more when we come back.
[02:20:48.770 --> 02:20:59.450]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I say I'm excited about bringing you the ultimate gut cleanse, exclusively available at thealexjonesstore.com, I'm not joking around.
[02:20:59.629 --> 02:21:02.930]  We don't sit there and shoot in the dark.
[02:21:03.229 --> 02:21:13.670]  We go out and we find what are already the best-selling, highest-rated products in the country, and we say, hey, we'd like to private label it, but we'd like you to make it a little bit stronger for us so it's proprietary.
[02:21:14.229 --> 02:21:15.530]  You got it right here.
[02:21:16.159 --> 02:21:17.299]  The ultimate gut cleanse.
[02:21:17.420 --> 02:21:19.020]  This is not just a gut cleanse.
[02:21:19.379 --> 02:21:20.520]  It's not just a detox.
[02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:23.799]  It doesn't just have natural ingredients that gently get rid of parasites.
[02:21:24.100 --> 02:21:25.139]  Oh, it's got that covered.
[02:21:25.479 --> 02:21:29.540]  It's then got a whole bunch of stuff in it like saw palmetto that's good for all your glands.
[02:21:29.819 --> 02:21:32.479]  And even the government admits great for men's prostates.
[02:21:32.809 --> 02:21:34.709]  And it goes on and on.
[02:21:34.889 --> 02:21:36.389]  I cannot read all the ingredients.
[02:21:36.489 --> 02:21:37.549]  They're concentrated.
[02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:38.629]  They're incredible.

[02:21:48.579 --> 02:21:49.799]  Well, Dave Smith is convenient.
[02:21:49.959 --> 02:21:52.659]  You can do Rogan's show a mile and a half away and come right over here.
[02:21:52.780 --> 02:21:54.559]  Your Rogan interview just dropped minutes ago.
[02:21:54.559 --> 02:21:56.639]  People should be sure and watch that and share it.
[02:21:56.760 --> 02:21:58.600]  It's invaluable information you're breaking down.
[02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:00.440]  You're going to leave here in a few minutes.
[02:22:00.520 --> 02:22:03.180]  I'm going to come back, cover other news, take calls for this historic victory.
[02:22:03.200 --> 02:22:04.159]  But we were getting into...
[02:22:04.620 --> 02:22:08.360]  P. Diddy, Epstein, all of that stuff is starting to come out.
[02:22:08.420 --> 02:22:18.600]  And you were mentioned in that famous clip that's literally gotten hundreds of millions of views, different versions of it, that they put out whenever the lawyer goes, you say the government's involved in the trafficking of children with the Clintons.
[02:22:18.639 --> 02:22:20.100]  And I go, you mean like Jeffrey Epstein?
[02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:21.239]  Yeah, that's funny.
[02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:25.879]  Of all the angles to go at you, you're like, that's what, you know this has come out, right?
[02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:27.780]  And so it's kind of, you know, it's like...
[02:22:28.639 --> 02:22:32.639]  Whatever, it's like the frogs being, which by the way, you were wrong.
[02:22:32.860 --> 02:22:34.600]  They weren't turning the frogs gay, they're turning them trans.
[02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:36.219]  So you should make a correction.
[02:22:36.420 --> 02:22:38.620]  But it is funny that they would still even go with that.
[02:22:38.719 --> 02:22:45.340]  But what a beautiful time to be alive, man, where like everybody knows that they're lying through their teeth about all of this stuff.
[02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:50.180]  But look, with the P. Diddy stuff, finding the cameras in all the rooms in his house.
[02:22:50.319 --> 02:22:52.299]  I mean, this is a huge part of how this works.
[02:22:53.270 --> 02:22:54.329]  Blackmail operations, you know?
[02:22:54.469 --> 02:22:58.370]  And so you got to keep that in mind that a lot of these people are compromised.
[02:22:58.850 --> 02:23:00.729]  And, you know, isn't that how it is now?
[02:23:00.930 --> 02:23:07.430]  Every time you see a celebrity come out and like endorse Kamala Harris over the last month, isn't your immediate instinct, you're like, oh, what do they got on you?
[02:23:07.690 --> 02:23:08.530]  What did you do?
[02:23:08.670 --> 02:23:08.930]  Absolutely.
[02:23:08.989 --> 02:23:10.709]  I'm not a huge Hollywood guy, but I've been in a few movies.
[02:23:10.829 --> 02:23:12.389]  They invited me to be in a lot of TV shows.
[02:23:12.489 --> 02:23:13.629]  I've been out there really...
[02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:33.409]  Yeah, look man, I mean, it's easy...
[02:23:33.989 --> 02:23:38.809]  You know, when you think about, like, the war machine, it's easy to feel like, hey, that's over there.
[02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:44.489]  You know, okay, sure, we slaughtered a million Iraqis based off lies, but that's, we do that to Iraqis.
[02:23:44.569 --> 02:23:45.170]  We don't do that, sorry.
[02:23:45.430 --> 02:23:50.590]  But, man, people who are so evil that they would do that, what do you think they're doing?
[02:23:50.909 --> 02:23:58.190]  You know, it's like, if you found out that somebody had abused little kids, would you ever have them babysit your kids?
[02:23:58.389 --> 02:23:59.770]  Of course not, you know?
[02:23:59.909 --> 02:24:00.569]  Well, look at Tim Walz.
[02:24:00.569 --> 02:24:01.530]  You would never be like, oh, they do it to them.
[02:24:01.709 --> 02:24:03.469]  I'm not saying Tim Walz is a pedophile.
[02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.819]  Although he did counsel the young gay students.
[02:24:06.899 --> 02:24:07.200]  It seems weird.
[02:24:07.399 --> 02:24:13.319]  What I'm saying is, if I was going to cast somebody in a movie that drives running in an ice cream truck kidnapping kids, it'd be him.
[02:24:13.959 --> 02:24:15.180]  Yeah, he really was.
[02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:17.540]  I mean, there's something profoundly creepy about that guy.
[02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:18.659]  And also, I don't know what he did.
[02:24:18.719 --> 02:24:22.120]  But then you find out he was having these trips and taking these young kids over there.
[02:24:22.260 --> 02:24:22.700]  It's like, ugh.
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:24.860]  There is a...
[02:24:24.860 --> 02:24:30.659]  If you want to look at it in religious terms or secular terms, if you want to think of it as demonic or you just want to think...
[02:24:31.129 --> 02:24:35.010]  No matter whether you're an atheist or a religious person, evil is real.
[02:24:35.790 --> 02:24:36.889]  Evil exists.
[02:24:37.489 --> 02:24:41.629]  And man, it permeates the ruling class in the United States of America.
[02:24:42.409 --> 02:24:45.469]  And when you deny it, that's what gives it power.
[02:24:45.469 --> 02:24:47.170]  But there is the awakening of that fact.
[02:24:47.309 --> 02:24:48.610]  In closing, I want to say this.
[02:24:49.579 --> 02:24:57.540]  The reason I know we've won, unless they blow the planet up with nuclear war, which is a real possibility, so that's the first thing, get Trump in in 73 days, take the nuclear keys away, de-escalate all this.
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:03.959]  Now he's already behind the scenes trying to get him to do a deal ahead of time, which he may be able to do with Putin and Zelensky and the rest of it.
[02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:10.270]  No matter what happens to me, I see you, and you've been around forever and were super smart.
[02:25:10.469 --> 02:25:24.870]  There are so many prominent talk show hosts that are just reaching tens of millions a day like you do, nailing it, that the globalists thought taking me off the air or persecuting me or getting Trump when there weren't a lot of us as prominent eight, nine years ago.
[02:25:25.190 --> 02:25:41.659]  Now, the crop of super smart, eloquent people that have been around a long time and were already big that are huge now because the public is tuning into it because their awakening The growth curve of people understanding this and our initiative getting so strong, that's why I tell the New World Order,
[02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:46.840]  you need to capitulate now because I kind of start in this like we started it.
[02:25:46.979 --> 02:25:54.600]  I don't see how the globalist, corrupt, kleptocratic, corporate, transhumanist system survives now.
[02:25:54.760 --> 02:25:55.659]  I mean, they can't.
[02:25:56.920 --> 02:26:03.280]  Yeah, and as you've said many times over the years, it's not a left-right dynamic.
[02:26:03.559 --> 02:26:06.780]  It's more of like a corrupt versus honest dynamic.
[02:26:06.959 --> 02:26:08.579]  And you see a big awakening.
[02:26:08.799 --> 02:26:15.780]  Look, people like Joe Rogan and Elon Musk and Bobby Kennedy and Nicole Shanahan and Tulsi Gabbard, they're liberals.
[02:26:16.479 --> 02:26:18.079]  And they haven't stopped being liberals.
[02:26:18.379 --> 02:26:20.239]  They didn't become right-wing conservatives.
[02:26:20.239 --> 02:26:21.760]  They're the same they always were.
[02:26:21.860 --> 02:26:24.280]  Glenn Greenwald's the same as he always was.
[02:26:24.459 --> 02:26:27.659]  They call them right-wingers now because they're like, you know what I mean?
[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:29.299]  Many of them endorse Donald Trump.
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:30.200]  Because they're sane.
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:31.459]  Yeah, they're just waking up.
[02:26:47.959 --> 02:26:50.180]  I've never heard of him, but he's got a big show out there.
[02:26:50.590 --> 02:26:56.709]  I see now the most effective people with the films, the documentaries, the books, the ads for Trump.
[02:26:56.889 --> 02:27:00.129]  Like Mickey Willis, big liberal, loving guy, super sweet, naive.
[02:27:00.569 --> 02:27:02.270]  Works the highest levels for Bernie Sanders.
[02:27:02.510 --> 02:27:03.569]  Goes to the closed door meetings.
[02:27:03.649 --> 02:27:04.549]  They go, yeah, we're all communists.
[02:27:04.629 --> 02:27:05.649]  We're going to have a purge and take over.
[02:27:05.709 --> 02:27:07.069]  He goes, well, I don't want a communist purge.
[02:27:07.290 --> 02:27:14.350]  And now he's the guy with Elon Musk funding them and Dale Bigtree that put out some of the most devastating ads that had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[02:27:14.409 --> 02:27:15.510]  I mean, he came and quantified it.
[02:27:16.069 --> 02:27:26.309]  I've played on national TV, and I look at the real loving liberals that were good people but were deceived, and as the system got so obvious, they are now some of the most powerful people in the fight.
[02:27:26.469 --> 02:27:33.909]  And of course, as you know, I came into this game with Ron Paul's 2008 presidential campaign.
[02:27:33.909 --> 02:27:38.709]  It was the Ron Paul Giuliani moment is what first sparked my interest in all of this stuff.
[02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:50.579]  And You know, you, Alex, I mean, can you imagine in the year 2007, if I had to think about where the average Republican voter was then, to where the average Republican voter is now?
[02:27:50.860 --> 02:27:58.760]  I mean, they were, you could count on them to be loyal foot soldiers for the FBI, the CIA, the military, just support any war.
[02:27:58.899 --> 02:28:01.059]  Now, they don't trust any of it.
[02:28:01.159 --> 02:28:03.219]  They know that it's all based on lies.
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:04.579]  That is amazing.
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:05.360]  The Great Awakening.
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:06.180]  It's amazing.
[02:28:06.459 --> 02:28:10.420]  And you were there so you remember it, but you can read State Department reports and the congressional hearings they've had.
[02:28:10.579 --> 02:28:12.500]  It's not about putting myself in the story, it's history.
[02:28:12.899 --> 02:28:17.059]  Time Magazine articles back when Time was really Time, they would go the origins of Trump.
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:24.100]  They would go back to Ron Paul, the Tea Party, and then my show explaining the globalist system that Paul would get some into.
[02:28:24.549 --> 02:28:44.649]  And then they admitted, they did surveys back then, 20 years ago, 15 years ago, of the people, and they said, it's Alex Jones and Ron Paul that then with this Republican Tea Party that we took over, then Paul did those presidential runs, they blocked him out, cheated, he didn't win, but he won the hearts and minds of a beachhead in the Republicans to then lay the groundwork for Trump,
[02:28:44.649 --> 02:28:45.909]  who wasn't fully awake.
[02:28:46.250 --> 02:28:47.129]  Now we've...
[02:28:47.409 --> 02:28:55.309]  Woken him up, and now we've, quote, radicalized him, and now Ron Paul's coming in, now Elon Musk, and you can see it.
[02:28:55.569 --> 02:28:56.309]  It's here.
[02:28:56.430 --> 02:28:58.270]  You can see God's hand on this.
[02:28:58.370 --> 02:28:59.870]  Yeah, no question about it.
[02:28:59.950 --> 02:29:11.430]  I mean, I've always said that the Ron Paul campaigns in 2008 and 2012 are what laid the groundwork for Donald Trump in 2016 to be able to turn to Jeb Bush and say, your brother lied us into war.
[02:29:11.530 --> 02:29:15.309]  And for the entire Republican audience who voted for...
[02:29:15.559 --> 02:29:21.100]  George W. Bush and defended that war, they were able to look at each other and go, you know what?
[02:29:21.159 --> 02:29:21.719]  He's right.
[02:29:22.159 --> 02:29:22.780]  He's right.
[02:29:22.959 --> 02:29:23.639]  They did lie.
[02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:25.559]  So the Republicans began to find their soul.
[02:29:25.739 --> 02:29:27.440]  How do we, final comment, I gotta go.
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:31.680]  How, Dave Smith, do we get Democrats, go back to the first question, but now we can answer it.
[02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:32.360]  I'm thinking of this.
[02:29:32.909 --> 02:29:36.149]  We go, look, Republicans found their soul as a constituency.
[02:29:36.190 --> 02:29:38.729]  We haven't taken it over completely yet, but we were wrong.
[02:29:38.829 --> 02:29:39.450]  We did bad stuff.
[02:29:39.750 --> 02:29:42.049]  The Republican Party was just as bad as Democrats 10, 15 years ago.
[02:29:42.149 --> 02:29:47.430]  But we're the beachhead of populism and common sense now, not because we're perfect, but because it's the only place it's allowed.
[02:29:48.049 --> 02:29:49.469]  Can you find your soul again?
[02:29:50.190 --> 02:29:53.010]  Well, you know, look, I don't know.
[02:29:53.370 --> 02:29:53.770]  But...
[02:29:54.540 --> 02:30:00.600]  Like I just said, the transformation from the Republican voters over the last 20 years has been nothing short of miraculous.
[02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:06.239]  And so never close yourself off to the possibility that maybe something similar can happen on the other side.
[02:30:06.639 --> 02:30:08.420]  Listen, we need this.
[02:30:08.700 --> 02:30:15.299]  We can't have, the fact that, say, major cities are being destroyed across America over the last few years particularly.
[02:30:15.889 --> 02:30:20.770]  And I've seen right-wingers who live in more rural areas going like, good, that's what they voted for.
[02:30:20.850 --> 02:30:21.489]  They deserve that.
[02:30:21.549 --> 02:30:22.530]  It's like, no, no, no.
[02:30:22.530 --> 02:30:25.670]  The globalists admit they're collapsing the cities and collapse the whole thing.
[02:30:25.709 --> 02:30:26.090]  That's right.
[02:30:26.229 --> 02:30:27.549]  This is the United States of America.
[02:30:27.649 --> 02:30:30.909]  We don't want to have disaster zones anywhere in our country.
[02:30:31.709 --> 02:30:33.170]  There's something about that, too.
[02:30:33.350 --> 02:30:36.530]  It's like if anyone, a nation is kind of like a family.
[02:30:36.639 --> 02:30:38.340]  I'm glad the left saw dying from the shots.
[02:30:38.540 --> 02:30:38.719]  No!
[02:30:38.979 --> 02:30:40.059]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:30:40.200 --> 02:30:41.239]  We don't root for that.
[02:30:41.340 --> 02:30:41.979]  We want to heal.
[02:30:42.200 --> 02:30:46.479]  And I am, right now, I'm as optimistic as I've ever been about the future.
[02:30:47.440 --> 02:30:49.360]  Dave Smith, I'm very impressed.
[02:30:49.500 --> 02:30:49.840]  Amazing.
[02:30:50.159 --> 02:30:51.959]  Thank you so much, Dave Smith.
[02:30:53.560 --> 02:30:57.920]  Comicdavesmith.com at Comic Dave Smith on X. We're going to air this just a few minutes.
[02:30:58.500 --> 02:31:00.360]  We called it hours before everybody else.
[02:31:00.520 --> 02:31:01.420]  We got the champagne out.
[02:31:01.520 --> 02:31:01.959]  We were right.
[02:31:03.040 --> 02:31:06.159]  This is from Tuesday evening still.
[02:31:06.319 --> 02:31:08.239]  It hadn't even gone into Wednesday yet.
[02:31:08.739 --> 02:31:09.899]  And it was amazing.
[02:31:10.100 --> 02:31:11.659]  We're going to air this for a few minutes while he leaves.
[02:31:11.780 --> 02:31:14.000]  I'm going to come back, give up the number, cover all the news, take your calls.
[02:31:14.280 --> 02:31:15.180]  Dave Smith, thank you so much, brother.
[02:31:15.459 --> 02:31:16.120]  Thank you so much.
[02:31:16.319 --> 02:31:16.959]  Thank you for having me.
[02:31:17.040 --> 02:31:17.559]  Very impressive.
[02:31:17.840 --> 02:31:18.620]  Love the audience.
[02:31:18.780 --> 02:31:19.280]  Love the crew.
[02:31:19.459 --> 02:31:20.399]  We're so blessed to be here.
[02:31:20.620 --> 02:31:21.360]  We'll be right back.
[02:31:22.329 --> 02:31:25.770]  Tonight with the crew in the same studio as we were eight years ago.
[02:31:26.469 --> 02:31:28.090]  And I just want to salute everybody.
[02:31:29.010 --> 02:31:30.090]  It is the victory.
[02:31:31.190 --> 02:31:33.670]  Who knows what they're going to pull now, but Trump has won.
[02:31:33.870 --> 02:31:35.090]  It's already being announced.
[02:31:35.989 --> 02:31:37.629]  This is a day long remembered.
[02:31:37.770 --> 02:31:38.430]  Come in here, crew.
[02:31:38.590 --> 02:31:38.989]  I love you.
[02:31:39.489 --> 02:31:41.149]  You have put up with so much.
[02:31:41.270 --> 02:31:42.290]  You've gone through so much.
[02:31:42.350 --> 02:31:45.030]  Owen went to prison, and they're going to come after us again.
[02:31:45.170 --> 02:31:45.729]  But you know what?
[02:31:45.870 --> 02:31:46.889]  They know we're not intimidated.
[02:31:47.149 --> 02:31:48.190]  They know we're going to keep fighting.
[02:31:49.090 --> 02:31:50.090]  God bless you all.
[02:31:50.190 --> 02:31:52.649]  Anybody else eat any more of this delicious apple juice?
[02:31:52.989 --> 02:31:53.989]  I love you guys.
[02:31:54.270 --> 02:31:54.790]  Oh, yes.
[02:31:54.809 --> 02:31:56.149]  Let me give the lady here.
[02:31:57.389 --> 02:31:58.250]  Some of this here.
[02:31:58.469 --> 02:32:03.030]  All right, sorry, we were, I was dumbfounded, God smacked here.
[02:32:03.709 --> 02:32:06.950]  Here is to all the listeners and viewers that kept us in attack formation.
[02:32:07.309 --> 02:32:12.309]  Here's the President Trump, our champion, his incredible stalwart, Will, his family standing with him.
[02:32:12.709 --> 02:32:14.709]  Here's to God, of course, number one.
[02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:18.729]  And of course, we are now gonna go after the child traffickers and find out where the children are.
[02:32:19.350 --> 02:32:20.889]  We're gonna take the floor out of the water.
[02:32:21.010 --> 02:32:22.569]  We're gonna go after the poison vaccines.
[02:32:22.709 --> 02:32:24.610]  We're gonna stop World War III if God is with us.
[02:32:24.829 --> 02:32:27.309]  All praise goes to God, but God works through the people.
[02:32:27.569 --> 02:32:33.620]  And so for myself and the whole crew, on the eve of our shutdown next week, We will never surrender in the face of tyranny.
[02:32:33.700 --> 02:32:34.959]  We know more obstacles are coming.
[02:32:35.219 --> 02:32:38.100]  We know the real fight starts in the 76 days while he's president-elect.
[02:32:38.319 --> 02:32:49.819]  We pray for President Trump, but now we take a moment to celebrate that we stood against the tyrants and have won a major strategic, historic battle against the globalists.
[02:32:49.920 --> 02:32:51.459]  And this is just the beginning.
[02:32:51.719 --> 02:32:56.120]  They declared war on us, and we accepted the challenge!
[02:32:56.840 --> 02:32:57.360]  Yes!
[02:32:58.059 --> 02:32:58.139]  Yes!
[02:33:02.139 --> 02:33:03.440]  Yes, I love you all.
[02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:07.620]  It's been a war, and the war continues.
[02:33:08.579 --> 02:33:10.819]  I love you, Owen.
[02:33:11.120 --> 02:33:11.979]  I love all of you.
[02:33:13.059 --> 02:33:18.979]  Incredible job, and we only got two microphones here, but I would like to maybe have folks come up to the microphone in the other studio so everybody can get on air.
[02:33:19.079 --> 02:33:20.059]  But this is just crazy.
[02:33:20.200 --> 02:33:22.520]  Owen, get in here, and then Harrison, broadcast them.
[02:33:22.559 --> 02:33:23.399]  Give us your views right here.
[02:33:24.260 --> 02:33:26.260]  I think my lav mic might still be on.
[02:33:26.719 --> 02:33:27.840]  It's okay, sit down right here.
[02:33:29.069 --> 02:33:30.430]  It's over in Pennsylvania.
[02:33:30.770 --> 02:33:31.110]  It's over.
[02:33:31.270 --> 02:33:32.090]  The numbers are in.
[02:33:32.270 --> 02:33:33.290]  They can't come back.
[02:33:33.489 --> 02:33:35.170]  It's officially 270.
[02:33:36.049 --> 02:33:39.870]  Trump might wait until they officially declare it, but it's done.
[02:33:40.430 --> 02:33:41.370]  We did it.
[02:33:41.950 --> 02:33:45.350]  Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona might go for Trump too.
[02:33:45.549 --> 02:33:47.049]  So it's a little bit of a light landslide.
[02:33:47.129 --> 02:33:49.629]  Looks like Republicans are gonna get at least plus three in the Senate.
[02:33:50.280 --> 02:33:51.680]  At least plus four in the House.
[02:33:52.059 --> 02:33:56.159]  We have new leadership at both the Senate and the House level that are serious.
[02:33:56.340 --> 02:33:57.079]  They're behind Trump.
[02:33:57.360 --> 02:33:58.899]  We have Elon Musk on our team.
[02:33:59.180 --> 02:34:01.780]  We've got Vivek Ramaswamy changing the message for the future.
[02:34:01.940 --> 02:34:05.280]  We have JD Vance, who's about as down to earth as it gets.
[02:34:05.399 --> 02:34:06.239]  We have RFK Jr.
[02:34:06.420 --> 02:34:10.059]  who wants to take the fluoride out of the water, the microplastics out of the food.
[02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:11.540]  I don't know.
[02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:15.100]  I'm almost in suspension right now.
[02:34:15.239 --> 02:34:26.459]  I can't even believe That everything we've worked for, everything we've envisioned, all the common sense barriers for us to take down to release the American potential, the potential of the American citizen.
[02:34:27.059 --> 02:34:37.309]  I hope, I really mean this, I hope to all the brainwashed, deranged leftists that are suffering tonight, That this will be your last moment of suffering.
[02:34:37.549 --> 02:34:39.750]  I hope that they will join us in this victory.
[02:34:39.889 --> 02:34:41.190]  This is a victory for you too.
[02:34:41.469 --> 02:34:42.549]  We are freeing you.
[02:34:42.809 --> 02:34:44.149]  We are freeing your minds.
[02:34:44.329 --> 02:34:45.489]  We are freeing your bodies.
[02:34:45.709 --> 02:34:46.850]  We are freeing your souls.
[02:34:47.149 --> 02:34:48.209]  Join our team.
[02:34:48.469 --> 02:34:49.930]  We are raising the tides.
[02:34:50.069 --> 02:34:51.270]  We are raising all the ships.
[02:34:52.069 --> 02:34:54.889]  And just join the team.
[02:34:55.620 --> 02:35:03.459]  Even if you hate Donald Trump and you can't stand the side of him, join Team Humanity, join Team Common Sense, join Team America.
[02:35:03.959 --> 02:35:06.719]  This could be the American Revolution 2.0.
[02:35:06.860 --> 02:35:10.399]  When America was founded, it changed the entire course of human history.
[02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:11.959]  We're doing it again tonight.
[02:35:12.260 --> 02:35:13.940]  We're taking our country back!
[02:35:19.799 --> 02:35:20.260]  That's it.
[02:35:20.379 --> 02:35:20.899]  Anybody else?
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:21.520]  Get in there.
[02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:22.120]  Come on in.
[02:35:22.139 --> 02:35:22.700]  Rex Jones.
[02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:23.420]  No, I'm all right.
[02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:23.920]  All right.
[02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:25.120]  Cheers.
[02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:26.799]  Anybody else want to go?
[02:35:26.799 --> 02:35:28.020]  Rob Dew, you want to scream?
[02:35:28.219 --> 02:35:29.020]  You want to let a...
[02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:30.520]  I'm just going to say this.
[02:35:30.819 --> 02:35:32.379]  I agree with your message.
[02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:44.440]  You know, with putting a hand out to these people who are under some serious mind control, there's a mind control going on in this country, and it's ending now.
[02:35:45.020 --> 02:35:47.959]  And people are going to see how much better their lives are going to be.
[02:35:48.100 --> 02:35:49.940]  Because a lot of these leftists are into health.
[02:35:50.219 --> 02:35:56.780]  And now when that RFK is coming out and he's going to be hardcore on what's in our food and getting that stuff, that's where it's going to happen.
[02:35:57.079 --> 02:35:59.879]  That's where these people are going to go, wait a minute, maybe I was on the wrong side.
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:01.979]  Maybe I didn't know what was going on.
[02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:07.239]  And if they catch more of this cheating that they're doing, we got to get rid of these goddamn election machines.
[02:36:07.430 --> 02:36:08.149]  They suck.
[02:36:08.549 --> 02:36:09.989]  They just suck.
[02:36:10.290 --> 02:36:12.350]  This thing where it takes 14.
[02:36:12.670 --> 02:36:13.530]  Yeah, it's gotta go.
[02:36:13.729 --> 02:36:19.610]  I like one day make it a national holiday, make everybody dip their thumb in purple ink and let's just do it.
[02:36:19.809 --> 02:36:21.170]  You know, let's stop screwing around.
[02:36:21.270 --> 02:36:22.430]  There's no reason.
[02:36:22.510 --> 02:36:24.850]  There's no reason to be messing around with this anymore.
[02:36:25.250 --> 02:36:27.549]  All right, the mainstream media is defunct.
[02:36:27.850 --> 02:36:29.110]  They should be shunned.
[02:36:29.329 --> 02:36:30.889]  All these people should go away.
[02:36:31.090 --> 02:36:32.090]  They're disgusting.
[02:36:33.010 --> 02:36:34.809]  And then they're not gonna stop either.
[02:36:34.909 --> 02:36:35.909]  They're gonna keep coming after us.
[02:36:36.030 --> 02:36:39.389]  We cannot let them get an ounce of breath at this point.
[02:36:39.489 --> 02:36:43.510]  Fix me and add something in full war with the 1776 Devastator.
[02:36:44.090 --> 02:36:50.030]  Yeah, no, without mail-in ballots and illegal immigration, this election wouldn't even be close at all.
[02:36:50.190 --> 02:36:51.149]  Everywhere is shift red.
[02:36:51.329 --> 02:36:54.049]  I hope this is utterly demoralizing for the left.
[02:36:54.139 --> 02:37:04.280]  I hope that they realize that it doesn't matter how many times you call us racist, how many smears you come up with, how many lies you run with, how many scandals you fabricate from whole cloth, it doesn't work.
[02:37:04.340 --> 02:37:06.540]  The American people have risen up, so you can shut up now.
[02:37:06.639 --> 02:37:07.379]  You can just shut up.
[02:37:07.459 --> 02:37:08.879]  You can stop all of your little tricks.
[02:37:08.979 --> 02:37:10.479]  You can stop all of your little scams.
[02:37:10.700 --> 02:37:11.860]  It's got to be exhausting.
[02:37:11.860 --> 02:37:14.079]  You put a lot of work into it, and you fail.
[02:37:14.260 --> 02:37:14.840]  So enough.
[02:37:15.139 --> 02:37:15.840]  Go away.
[02:37:16.059 --> 02:37:16.840]  Leave us alone.
[02:37:17.299 --> 02:37:18.000]  Shut up.
[02:37:18.180 --> 02:37:20.840]  I'm not trying to be rude here, but it's time.
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:25.549]  It's time for- And stay away from our kids, and we're going to find the missing kids, and we're going to put your leaders in prison.
[02:37:25.629 --> 02:37:26.049]  How's that sound?
[02:37:26.879 --> 02:37:30.540]  Alright, I want to give the number, I want to cover a ton of news, a ton of clubs, breaking news.
[02:37:31.139 --> 02:37:36.059]  Kamala and her speech yesterday where a squirrel runs on stage for Peanut, goes to Peanut.
[02:37:36.299 --> 02:37:40.399]  But let me just say this, I got so hyped up and so very impressed with Dave Smith in person.
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:41.819]  Already impressed, but super impressed.
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:42.659]  The guy knows what he's talking about.
[02:37:42.979 --> 02:37:45.159]  That's the guy that knows what's going on.
[02:37:46.799 --> 02:37:53.579]  Got a major grasp of politics and life and history and to say the stuff he was saying, you can't fake that.
[02:37:54.139 --> 02:37:55.579]  That I didn't even plug last hour.
[02:37:56.530 --> 02:37:57.850]  We're in the middle of a fundraiser.
[02:37:58.709 --> 02:38:02.389]  We could be shut down next Wednesday if the bad guys buy this.
[02:38:02.510 --> 02:38:03.370]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:38:04.049 --> 02:38:12.930]  We've got backup stuff, the servers, the satellite uplinks, the money for the crew, and there's enough to barely operate.
[02:38:14.549 --> 02:38:23.790]  Plus, these are great products you need, so I want you to go to the AlexJonesStore.com, because even if InfoWars gets shut down, our sponsor's great, and that will keep us on the air.
[02:38:24.430 --> 02:38:26.309]  All the great new Trump gear is there.
[02:38:26.430 --> 02:38:30.870]  These are the best-looking Trump shirts ever, because they've got great designs.
[02:38:30.870 --> 02:38:31.670]  They're made here in America.
[02:38:31.670 --> 02:38:32.350]  They're in Arkansas.
[02:38:32.989 --> 02:38:33.430]  And...
[02:38:34.290 --> 02:38:35.409]  It's Trump won!
[02:38:36.110 --> 02:38:38.409]  Beautiful red and white hat with the gold eagle.
[02:38:39.209 --> 02:38:40.190]  Amazing hoodies.
[02:38:40.450 --> 02:38:41.370]  Amazing shirts.
[02:38:41.930 --> 02:38:44.569]  The landslide definition shirt is what everybody ought to wear.
[02:38:45.270 --> 02:38:48.950]  It's got the website on there as well.

[02:39:53.559 --> 02:39:56.940]  No, it's Irish CMOS, the recognized superfood, probably the best in the world.
[02:39:57.670 --> 02:40:00.250]  You can say hemp derivatives, or it's a superfood.
[02:40:00.469 --> 02:40:04.790]  And you can say a few other things, garlic stone, or red wine concentrate.
[02:40:06.229 --> 02:40:07.729]  Ultimate Seamoss is right up there.
[02:40:07.909 --> 02:40:10.430]  Probably the best superfood out there.

[02:40:19.329 --> 02:40:22.350]  The gummies, the powdered capsules are twice as strong.
[02:40:22.750 --> 02:40:24.930]  Ultimate Seamoss, the Alex Jones store.com.

[02:40:47.190 --> 02:40:48.489]  We want you to love the products.
[02:40:49.450 --> 02:40:50.530]  Try the HydroForce.
[02:40:50.610 --> 02:40:53.309]  That's vitamins and minerals with the great electrolytes.
[02:40:53.450 --> 02:40:55.709]  It's like vitamin and mineral fusion, but with electrolytes, it's amazing.
[02:40:56.229 --> 02:41:00.329]  High-end of a top company that let us private label it, so it's already rated and loved by everybody.
[02:41:00.709 --> 02:41:01.409]  It's real simple.
[02:41:01.409 --> 02:41:02.170]  Our research works.
[02:41:02.250 --> 02:41:04.430]  Just go out and get whoever's already got the best and then private label it.
[02:41:04.530 --> 02:41:05.629]  And most folks let us do it.
[02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:07.290]  So most of the stuff you get there is private label.
[02:41:07.370 --> 02:41:08.090]  Some things we...
[02:41:10.359 --> 02:41:14.399]  Proprietarily copy what's already a bestseller and highest rated and then make it a little bit better so we can say it's the best.
[02:41:14.799 --> 02:41:16.139]  So our stuff's really top of the line.
[02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:17.020]  Our sponsor's top of the line.
[02:41:17.100 --> 02:41:17.579]  They work with me.
[02:41:17.659 --> 02:41:18.280]  They listen to me.
[02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:20.360]  That's why it took six months to get this stuff going.
[02:41:20.479 --> 02:41:22.500]  We were working with them for three, four months before they became a sponsor.
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:23.600]  They got this lined up.
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:25.139]  Still took months to get the stuff in.
[02:41:25.340 --> 02:41:27.340]  It's in the AlexShillStore.com.
[02:41:27.459 --> 02:41:30.520]  But the Trump gear It's amazing.
[02:41:30.780 --> 02:41:32.120]  And you exercise your free speech.
[02:41:32.540 --> 02:41:33.920]  You stand for the bullies.
[02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:36.200]  You let everybody know that, hey, we took the country back.
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:37.760]  We're not going to let you take it back from us.
[02:41:38.420 --> 02:41:40.840]  We won the big battle, but now we're going to win the war.
[02:41:41.500 --> 02:41:42.719]  And you support our broadcast.
[02:41:42.739 --> 02:41:43.760]  That is a trifecta.
[02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:44.420]  You support Trump.
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:45.260]  You support the win.
[02:41:45.340 --> 02:41:46.020]  You support the country.
[02:41:46.059 --> 02:41:46.819]  You spread the word.
[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:48.340]  You exercise your free speech.
[02:41:48.899 --> 02:41:52.860]  And you support this operation that is a real thorn on the side of the New World Order.
[02:41:52.940 --> 02:41:56.000]  So that's kind of four or five things, but it's bigger than the trifecta.

[02:42:27.370 --> 02:42:28.370]  They sell a lot of it.

[02:43:05.079 --> 02:43:12.280]  On the election, on Trump, on the victory, what you think's most important, what you think the deep state's going to pull.
[02:43:12.420 --> 02:43:15.780]  We're talking about this major battle, historic, that's been won.
[02:43:17.069 --> 02:43:18.909]  73 days till he is in office.
[02:43:19.110 --> 02:43:20.450]  What are they going to pull between then?
[02:43:20.690 --> 02:43:22.409]  They look pretty dejected.
[02:43:22.450 --> 02:43:24.309]  They look defeated, but they're still going to keep attacking.
[02:43:24.610 --> 02:43:27.329]  If Trump doesn't go on total offense, it's the right thing to do.
[02:43:27.430 --> 02:43:28.030]  It's not vengeance.
[02:43:28.610 --> 02:43:30.069]  They will come back.
[02:43:30.549 --> 02:43:33.870]  And so we've got a war game, this.
[02:43:33.969 --> 02:43:35.409]  And I can tell you, we've got the president's ear.
[02:43:35.850 --> 02:43:37.649]  We've got the ears of all his other advisors.
[02:43:38.649 --> 02:43:39.329]  They all listen.
[02:43:39.850 --> 02:43:41.690]  They all listen pretty much every day.
[02:43:42.030 --> 02:43:45.370]  And because of you spreading the word and your support, we are in a great position together.
[02:43:45.610 --> 02:43:50.409]  I mean, I just, real Alex Jones alone, the game changer of action, I mean, I didn't count it all up.
[02:43:50.489 --> 02:43:59.329]  I stopped counting this morning, because I didn't have time, just going through, and I saw over 300 million views just the last day, and I stopped.
[02:43:59.809 --> 02:44:01.610]  I mean, if I kept going...
[02:44:03.270 --> 02:44:08.370]  I mean, just the General Flynn interview yesterday broke it up in three pieces.
[02:44:09.170 --> 02:44:13.049]  This morning I looked at it and it had 60 million views.
[02:44:14.030 --> 02:44:21.270]  And we're talking about rolling up the deep state child predator networks that goes right to the top and how that's the most deadly blow.
[02:44:21.270 --> 02:44:22.069]  It's the right blow.
[02:44:23.190 --> 02:44:25.090]  It's the one that will destroy the system.
[02:44:25.350 --> 02:44:28.510]  It's the thing that will roll them all up because they're using the pedophilia to control it.
[02:44:28.610 --> 02:44:30.590]  So you've got to go after that or you never get control of it.
[02:44:30.649 --> 02:44:31.489]  Plus it's the right thing to do.
[02:44:31.590 --> 02:44:32.069]  But yeah.
[02:44:33.729 --> 02:44:37.850]  You heard Flynn go, well, Alex, let's not, you know, yeah, that's the plan.
[02:44:38.030 --> 02:44:40.409]  I'm like, yeah, and later I'm talking to folks off air.
[02:44:40.510 --> 02:44:43.770]  They're like, yeah, Jones, you're, you know, we understand you understand all this.
[02:44:43.870 --> 02:44:48.889]  You always know exactly, you know, what the right thing to do is, and that's the death blow and the right thing.
[02:44:49.209 --> 02:44:51.270]  But we don't want them to know we're coming for them.
[02:44:51.590 --> 02:44:52.229]  They know.
[02:44:52.809 --> 02:44:55.850]  Okay, so let's just get it all out in the open.
[02:44:55.989 --> 02:44:57.489]  Let's sign our John Hancock at the bottom.
[02:44:58.079 --> 02:44:58.719]  And let's go.
[02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:01.280]  And if anything happens to me, it's because of this.
[02:45:01.479 --> 02:45:03.860]  It's the most dangerous thing I've ever done is what I'm doing right now.
[02:45:03.959 --> 02:45:06.340]  I do it with pleasure and no fear.
[02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:09.899]  My only fear is God's watching me and God hates cowards.
[02:45:09.959 --> 02:45:13.780]  And I'm saluting the big guy and saying, you tell me what to do.
[02:45:13.940 --> 02:45:15.780]  I'm doing it to the best of my ability.
[02:45:19.659 --> 02:45:22.459]  I mean, I can't even call God my king, my master, my ruler.
[02:45:22.979 --> 02:45:24.020]  God is just everything.
[02:45:24.520 --> 02:45:26.139]  And I am in alignment with God.
[02:45:26.659 --> 02:45:33.700]  And God says, save the children and bring those to justice that are setting it up, and I will heal your land.
[02:45:34.059 --> 02:45:43.100]  And you get in there, and I rose you up for this, and you go in there, and you sound the bugle and the charge of the attack pattern, and you get in there, Jones, now!
[02:45:43.559 --> 02:45:44.319]  Do it!
[02:45:45.020 --> 02:45:45.899]  Yes, sir!
[02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:48.239]  Yes, sir!
[02:45:52.200 --> 02:45:53.379]  And you know what I say to God?
[02:45:55.360 --> 02:45:59.979]  Whatever has to happen to me, I'll follow that order.
[02:46:00.440 --> 02:46:02.440]  I don't say, please protect me when I do this.
[02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:04.280]  I say, your will be done.
[02:46:04.420 --> 02:46:05.319]  Thy kingdom come.
[02:46:06.459 --> 02:46:14.739]  Unless you've been hiding under a rock, you know that the pesticides that are in our food and our water destroy natural gut health.
[02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:20.559]  Not to mention all the chlorine and chemicals in the tap water that then also gets into the crops and the food.
[02:46:20.620 --> 02:46:21.500]  It's just all around us.
[02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:24.860]  So the globalists have been doing this by design.
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:25.440]  Bill Gates.
[02:46:26.100 --> 02:46:33.719]  Is basically investing billions of dollars in trying to manipulate the guts of people with so-called mRNA vaccines.
[02:46:33.959 --> 02:46:34.540]  It's insane.
[02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:40.959]  But all the research is just overwhelming that happy gut means happy, healthy body.
[02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:51.760]  We now have the ultimate gut combo with the ultimate probiotic with 60 billion, super high quality, with this baby, ultimate gut cleanse.
[02:46:51.940 --> 02:46:55.079]  Now, These are both private labeled, some of the top brands in the country.
[02:46:55.299 --> 02:46:57.940]  Our sponsors had to make it a little bit stronger, so it's proprietary.
[02:46:58.780 --> 02:47:02.159]  And the probiotics are very exciting and just a foundational thing that everybody should be doing.
[02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:04.159]  This is amazing.
[02:47:04.159 --> 02:47:05.540]  It's not just a gut cleanse.
[02:47:06.360 --> 02:47:13.100]  We may rename it down the road to gut cleanse, detox, anti-parasite.
[02:47:13.870 --> 02:47:25.690]  Pro-prostate, because it's concentrated, it's super strong, and it's got the gut cleanse, it's got the anti-parasite, it's got the sawpaw meadow.
[02:47:25.950 --> 02:47:32.159]  For not just your prostate, it's good for all your glands, but even the government's admitted for decades, sawpaw meadow is Insane.
[02:47:32.239 --> 02:47:32.600]  Look it up.
[02:47:32.700 --> 02:47:35.100]  So this is beyond a gut cleanse.
[02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:37.319]  It's got the trifecta going.
[02:47:37.559 --> 02:47:46.299]  I don't have time to read to you all of the amazing ingredients in this, but you can get Ultimate Gut Cleanse for 30 to 50% off, depending on how many bottles you get.
[02:47:46.479 --> 02:47:51.340]  And you can get Ultimate Probiotic for 30 to 50% off, depending on how many bottles you get.
[02:47:51.500 --> 02:47:58.500]  Or you can get both together in the Ultimate Combo for 50% off as an introductory offer right now.
[02:47:59.469 --> 02:48:02.709]  at thealexjonesstore.com and it's going to keep the broadcast on the air.
[02:48:02.889 --> 02:48:03.549]  That's a win-win.
[02:48:03.750 --> 02:48:04.370]  Please take action.
[02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:12.680]  I respectfully ask you to pay attention to what I'm about to say because it is critical in three important ways.
[02:48:12.899 --> 02:48:15.299]  It'll keep my broadcast on the air.
[02:48:15.620 --> 02:48:27.979]  It will get you the highest quality, amazing CBD that's so good for your whole body, inflammation, joints, you name it, and you're getting the best deal you're going to find anywhere.
[02:48:28.219 --> 02:48:31.200]  I've been promoting and selling CBD for more than 20 years.
[02:48:31.399 --> 02:48:35.639]  Everybody knows how amazing it is, but not all CBD is equal.
[02:48:36.209 --> 02:48:49.030]  This is a high-quality, made-in-Texas, very strong CBD, 1,000-milligram tincture that has been put in nanoparticles, so it's eight to nine times stronger than regular CBD that already gives you great effects.
[02:48:49.610 --> 02:48:59.590]  On top of that, we private label it from a top company that sells it to a bunch of other companies that sell it from between $140 to $90 to $76.
[02:49:00.489 --> 02:49:06.489]  This is the lowest price you're going to find on CBD of this quality anywhere in the market.
[02:49:06.709 --> 02:49:09.489]  The industry just massively marks it up.
[02:49:09.649 --> 02:49:17.750]  There's still some good margin in here for our sponsor to support their operation and support us, and then that savings is passed on to you.
[02:49:17.829 --> 02:49:24.569]  So if you want to get great CBD and keep the broadcast on air, visit JonesCBD.com.

[02:49:32.469 --> 02:49:33.530]  And Dreamwave.
[02:49:33.790 --> 02:49:36.930]  You want to get both of these, and it supports the broadcast.
[02:49:36.930 --> 02:49:46.649]  You will not be disappointed, particularly if you're already into CBD, and you take this that costs a third or half of what you're paying, and you get a great response.

[02:49:48.059 --> 02:49:52.399]  That's what I'm looking for is repeat customers for our sponsor, jonescbd.com.

[02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:06.840]  You know, if I'm going to open the phones up, I might want to give the phone number out.
[02:50:06.959 --> 02:50:08.000]  We're into the fourth hour now.
[02:50:08.239 --> 02:50:09.399]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[02:50:10.520 --> 02:50:10.920]  And...
[02:50:12.210 --> 02:50:14.590]  If you listen to what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying.
[02:50:14.670 --> 02:50:15.930]  You know how the networks of evil work.
[02:50:16.469 --> 02:50:17.770]  We know right where to hit them.
[02:50:17.969 --> 02:50:18.430]  Let's hit them.
[02:50:19.590 --> 02:50:21.969]  And folks are getting on board with this.
[02:50:22.530 --> 02:50:23.790]  Trump's getting on board with it.
[02:50:24.809 --> 02:50:28.510]  And so we're closing in.
[02:50:29.770 --> 02:50:32.590]  So that's where we are.
[02:50:33.309 --> 02:50:36.489]  Only by going on offense will we rout the enemy.
[02:50:37.549 --> 02:50:42.850]  This is the safest move to do, and it's the only way to go, and it's what God wants us to do.
[02:50:43.370 --> 02:50:55.149]  So just remember, the people trying to shut us down are fully backing all of this, and anything that happens to me, it's over this information, and that'll just make the information bigger.
[02:50:56.170 --> 02:50:59.450]  And it's all in God's plan, and I'm just doing what God says.
[02:51:00.250 --> 02:51:02.129]  So, that's where we are.
[02:51:03.759 --> 02:51:08.420]  Now, the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[02:51:10.479 --> 02:51:16.299]  877-789-ALEX. 877-789-2539.
[02:51:17.020 --> 02:51:32.920]  And we will take your calls on this historic election, your take on it, where you think this is going, how the power structure will strike back, What you think Trump's most important things are, stay alive, get into office, get good people in, stop World War III, secure the border,
[02:51:33.280 --> 02:51:37.620]  guard the human traffickers, the NGOs, roll it up, prosecute Mayorkas.
[02:51:41.540 --> 02:51:42.620]  That's what has to be done.
[02:51:42.739 --> 02:51:46.659]  I've got some clips I want to play right before I go to your calls and a lot more.
[02:51:47.809 --> 02:51:48.750]  But I want to say this.
[02:51:49.069 --> 02:51:58.969]  The enemies have said in court, Democratic Party, that them trying to take over InfoWars is about getting the catalog of my show so they can use bots to ban it everywhere.
[02:51:59.430 --> 02:52:00.629]  We have the documents.
[02:52:00.770 --> 02:52:01.549]  We have the contracts.
[02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:02.450]  We have the statements.
[02:52:02.690 --> 02:52:08.450]  It's like four inches thick, hundreds of videos, going back 25 years on InfoWars, you know, the site, been on Air 30.
[02:52:08.950 --> 02:52:11.370]  InfoWars is 27 years old, set up in 1996.
[02:52:12.969 --> 02:52:14.010]  97, early 97.
[02:52:14.350 --> 02:52:15.770]  Weird PD says 99, that's not true.
[02:52:16.489 --> 02:52:19.610]  And they got my middle name spelled wrong too, so there you go.
[02:52:19.750 --> 02:52:20.690]  Believe me, it's my name, I know.
[02:52:21.690 --> 02:52:23.930]  So, this is all free to air.
[02:52:24.069 --> 02:52:30.549]  Like, if I wrote Linux, which I didn't hypothetically, and gave it to the world free, and I declared bankruptcy 30 years later, they don't own Linux.
[02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:34.350]  Or I wrote a book and said it's free to the world, no publishing rights, it belongs to you.
[02:52:34.510 --> 02:52:37.909]  They can't come back and if I declare bankruptcy and some other thing, own that book.
[02:52:39.049 --> 02:52:41.489]  So, they don't want these shows on the air.
[02:52:42.799 --> 02:52:51.139]  And so before they can kill me or put me in prison, they've already tried to steal my identity and create a straw man of me and then silence me so that straw man can live on.
[02:52:51.260 --> 02:52:52.280]  It's a similar form of murder.
[02:52:52.440 --> 02:52:57.159]  It's just assassinating you and your ability to defend yourself so the straw man can operate as you.
[02:52:59.059 --> 02:53:01.459]  They know everything I've said for 30 years on air.
[02:53:01.540 --> 02:53:05.420]  People are digging up 30-year-old stuff now and it's going mega viral because it's not just evergreen, it's ultra green.
[02:53:06.430 --> 02:53:10.850]  They know that killing me will do nothing but make all of that more powerful.
[02:53:11.049 --> 02:53:16.469]  So they're like, well, we can get everything he said taken down, and then we can kill him.
[02:53:16.690 --> 02:53:18.870]  So I personally don't want to die.
[02:53:19.969 --> 02:53:23.129]  I personally don't want that to unfold.
[02:53:23.829 --> 02:53:26.049]  I would like to continue living and doing my job.
[02:53:26.649 --> 02:53:29.049]  And, you know, they shoot me in a red light and say that I'm...
[02:53:30.409 --> 02:53:34.329]  You know, a carjacker did it, or I'm found dead in a hotel room with a heroin needle in my arm.
[02:53:34.409 --> 02:53:34.850]  Don't do that.
[02:53:34.950 --> 02:53:36.309]  It's not for a month in those hotel rooms.
[02:53:36.850 --> 02:53:42.770]  Or their favorite thing to do is they come to your house and kill your wife and kids and then kill you and say you murder suicide.
[02:53:42.770 --> 02:53:43.709]  That would never happen.
[02:53:43.889 --> 02:53:45.590]  So, I mean, I get ahead of all that.
[02:53:46.430 --> 02:53:49.129]  I would never commit suicide, never hurt my family, any of that stuff.
[02:53:50.069 --> 02:54:00.729]  But I just want to get it 100% clear that if they thought they had a problem before with me advising Trump, Everybody else is awake, so they're all Alex Jones now, too.
[02:54:00.889 --> 02:54:03.790]  So I've already, like Agent Smith, put it in a good way, replicated.
[02:54:04.069 --> 02:54:05.709]  So there's an army in Alex Jones'.
[02:54:06.750 --> 02:54:08.930]  And so, it's came over.
[02:54:09.409 --> 02:54:10.430]  God has won.
[02:54:10.729 --> 02:54:11.629]  God did this, not me.
[02:54:11.829 --> 02:54:16.829]  But God through me, I mean, God working through me, is I have won.
[02:54:17.190 --> 02:54:18.010]  God has.
[02:54:18.149 --> 02:54:19.469]  I am invincible.
[02:54:19.909 --> 02:54:23.590]  The New World Order has been defeated when it comes to Alex Jones.
[02:54:23.750 --> 02:54:24.549]  And it's the same for you.
[02:54:25.049 --> 02:54:25.930]  God did it.
[02:54:25.950 --> 02:54:27.309]  But I am now victorious.
[02:54:27.809 --> 02:54:29.170]  We are now live.
[02:54:30.680 --> 02:54:36.139]  In hour number four, about to take your phone calls, two days in with a devastating victory.
[02:54:36.600 --> 02:54:40.159]  Owen Schroer's coming up in 53 and a half minutes with the war room.
[02:54:40.239 --> 02:54:44.840]  He is really good with all the numbers, but looks like we will keep the House with a narrow majority.
[02:54:45.180 --> 02:54:47.000]  Some major gains in the Senate.
[02:54:48.260 --> 02:54:54.860]  Trump is super hardcore, bathed in persecution and fire, battle-hardened.
[02:54:55.120 --> 02:54:56.000]  So are we.
[02:54:57.309 --> 02:54:58.409]  This is an amazing time.
[02:54:58.750 --> 02:55:01.950]  But Dave Smith in studio last hour was dead on.
[02:55:02.030 --> 02:55:02.770]  I want to show people this image.
[02:55:03.209 --> 02:55:04.350]  Radio listeners, I'll describe it.
[02:55:04.569 --> 02:55:23.129]  It's a bathtub, a cast iron tub with feet, old-fashioned bathtub with the frog, the patriot frog with the red hat on, and the nozzle of the shower is a MPC leftist,
[02:55:23.149 --> 02:55:25.250]  and the tears are bathing the frog.
[02:55:26.470 --> 02:55:42.969]  Now, the average brainwashed leftist thinks they're a rebel, thinks they're against the establishment when they work for it, they're brainwashed, and we can sit there and laugh at them, and I do it just as much as you, so I'm not lecturing you and I'm not saying I'm not guilty of it, and I know it's fun,
[02:55:43.170 --> 02:55:50.649]  but at the end of the day, These people are victims and bots of the enemy.
[02:55:51.149 --> 02:55:55.469]  And God wants us to try to reach out to them and deprogram them.
[02:55:55.510 --> 02:55:58.450]  Now, we shouldn't spend much of our time on that.
[02:55:58.610 --> 02:56:02.709]  We need to wake up people that already want to be fully awakened and help those that are already somewhat awake.
[02:56:02.950 --> 02:56:04.110]  That's more important.
[02:56:04.290 --> 02:56:06.069]  And back those that are fighting tyranny.
[02:56:06.590 --> 02:56:14.370]  But we need to talk about how we reach out to these people when we can and when the opportunities arise to do it.
[02:56:14.489 --> 02:56:15.829]  Pull up this heavy metal clip.
[02:56:16.860 --> 02:56:17.799]  Folks, put this out today.
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:18.940]  It's on X on Real Alex Jones.
[02:56:19.739 --> 02:56:20.899]  I love these folks.
[02:56:21.159 --> 02:56:25.340]  The same group's taking a lot of my rants and turn them into heavy metal or death metal.
[02:56:25.500 --> 02:56:29.260]  But metal song using an unhinged leftist rant as vocals.
[02:56:29.559 --> 02:56:32.100]  I said, I think she should go on tour.
[02:56:32.739 --> 02:56:37.100]  You could do a spinoff of The Little Mermaid and call it Ursula and the Sea Witches.
[02:56:37.819 --> 02:56:39.819]  People really like this.
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:41.340]  Did you guys get this clip when I sent it to you?
[02:56:42.040 --> 02:56:42.639]  We have it.
[02:56:42.879 --> 02:56:43.479]  It's short.
[02:56:43.579 --> 02:56:43.940]  Here it is.
[02:57:20.850 --> 02:57:22.370]  I mean, yeah, it's funny.
[02:57:22.950 --> 02:57:25.809]  But they all have that demonic look in their eyes.
[02:57:25.969 --> 02:57:28.629]  It's crazy women that are mainly under this.
[02:57:29.549 --> 02:57:34.069]  And beta dudes think it's cool and cry as well.
[02:57:34.409 --> 02:57:41.770]  And all we're trying to do is stop World War III and stabilize the currency and stop the human trafficking at the greatest levels ever seen in history.
[02:57:42.549 --> 02:57:46.049]  And you've got the most vicious central banks that are openly trying to implode the economy.
[02:57:46.209 --> 02:57:49.610]  They're in their own words to enslave us under economic tyranny.
[02:57:50.889 --> 02:57:53.030]  They just killed 30 million people with poison shots.
[02:57:53.270 --> 02:57:55.770]  And these people, and I've seen them around Austin.
[02:57:56.190 --> 02:58:01.850]  I've seen them walking, you know, I was up, I didn't sleep very much a couple hours ago.
[02:58:03.730 --> 02:58:05.450]  Tuesday night into Wednesday morning.
[02:58:05.569 --> 02:58:06.329]  Slept here on the couch.
[02:58:07.250 --> 02:58:12.590]  And so I drove home in the morning to do some stuff and drove through some neighborhoods.
[02:58:12.790 --> 02:58:14.750]  And I saw leptis walking their dogs and stuff.
[02:58:14.930 --> 02:58:16.649]  And they looked like they'd been run over by a truck.
[02:58:16.729 --> 02:58:17.809]  And I didn't go, oh, that's great.
[02:58:18.149 --> 02:58:19.010]  I've defeated them.
[02:58:19.129 --> 02:58:20.670]  I'm like, man, they are really stupid.
[02:58:21.049 --> 02:58:22.950]  I mean, we're trying to save their ass too.
[02:58:23.639 --> 02:58:29.280]  And it's so cut and dry that all the top real liberal intellectuals like Naomi Wolf and RFK Jr.
[02:58:29.459 --> 02:58:40.459]  and Tulsi Gabbards and Jimmy Dore and just everybody else has joined us and Elon Musk because they're like, yeah, the Democratic Party are anti-human death cult psychotics.
[02:58:41.760 --> 02:58:43.559]  Absolute dangerous lunatics.
[02:58:44.239 --> 02:58:44.620]  And...
[02:58:45.870 --> 02:58:51.729]  And again, we're attacking Pompeo and all the neocons that are just in ways worse because they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:58:51.829 --> 02:58:55.069]  But the average Republican voter has woken up and is rejecting this.
[02:58:55.209 --> 02:59:05.469]  I'd love for the Democratic Party to suddenly reform itself and remove its bad leadership and say, oh, look how God made that thing that's been evil for so long good.
[02:59:05.690 --> 02:59:06.930]  And God does that sometimes.
[02:59:07.030 --> 02:59:08.649]  But I don't think that's going to happen.
[02:59:09.370 --> 02:59:09.770]  So...
[02:59:10.960 --> 02:59:28.920]  We've got the attention, we've got the initiative, and I think exactly what our last guest was saying is, we just shun it, we withdraw support from it, we laugh at it, and we prosecute the leadership of it, but the people protesting by the tens of thousands in Chicago...
[02:59:31.159 --> 02:59:40.500]  Trump out, and then when Trump fulfills his promise to start going and getting the gangs and the human smugglers and deporting them, they'll use a few examples of, you know, women or whatever.
[02:59:40.600 --> 02:59:41.319]  Oh, he's a Nazi!
[02:59:41.479 --> 02:59:42.139]  Oh, it's terrible!
[02:59:44.379 --> 02:59:56.700]  We have to get ahead of that and just nail the human traffickers, nail the drug dealers, nail the MS-13, the Venezuelan gangs, And then roll up the NGOs and make it all about that because that's the worst group and that's who runs it.
[02:59:56.780 --> 02:59:58.520]  That way you stop them doing it in the future as well.
[02:59:59.040 --> 03:00:00.879]  And then we can move on to the military-aged men.
[03:00:02.219 --> 03:00:11.540]  But the women and children that were brought here, most of them are refugees of the globalist lockdown that was designed to collapse them and flood them here.
[03:00:11.700 --> 03:00:30.969]  So I think we develop a plan For them to go back to their country if they want, but those that were really trafficked, our government ran it with the UN. I think that they need to be paid.
[03:00:31.629 --> 03:00:38.729]  Because I'm not into reparations when it's 170 years ago and it's not the people that it happened to.
[03:00:39.740 --> 03:00:40.479]  No, no, no, no.
[03:00:40.780 --> 03:00:56.520]  When a government's been hijacked and does this, and again, it's the right thing to do, this will also take the moral high ground, and then you prosecute those that did it, and then the government, I mean, the government all over the country,
[03:00:56.719 --> 03:01:05.760]  nurses and bus drivers and people that got fired for not taking the poison shot, on average, they're getting like a million dollars.
[03:01:05.940 --> 03:01:07.739]  And people lost their jobs three, four years ago.
[03:01:08.800 --> 03:01:13.280]  And that teaches the government and the system you're not going to do that again.
[03:01:13.739 --> 03:01:17.420]  So losing your job over a poison shot, you get a million bucks in San Francisco.
[03:01:17.860 --> 03:01:19.680]  And that'll teach them not to be able to do it again.
[03:01:20.219 --> 03:01:21.520]  That's why justice is important.
[03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:39.020]  I mean, I think these people that can prove they've been kidnapped and brought here, children especially, God knows where their parents even are, where they were grabbed, three-month-old babies that are now two, three years old, You add that caveat,
[03:01:39.260 --> 03:01:45.299]  oh yeah, we're rounding up the criminals, the military-age men, but we got real sex-traffic slaves that the Democrats helped bring in and cover up.
[03:01:45.659 --> 03:01:47.739]  We don't just throw the Democrat leadership in prison.
[03:01:48.819 --> 03:01:49.180]  Money.
[03:01:50.340 --> 03:01:58.540]  And the left will see that, and that will finally click for those that actually think they're the moral high ground and go, oh my God, we're the monsters.
[03:01:58.680 --> 03:01:59.760]  Yeah, you are the monsters.
[03:02:01.520 --> 03:02:03.860]  And this is a big deal.
[03:02:03.920 --> 03:02:05.459]  So I've laid out the whole plan for Trump.
[03:02:06.579 --> 03:02:11.500]  And I've laid it out to his advisors, and it's the right thing to do.
[03:02:13.780 --> 03:02:15.959]  It's inspired by God.
[03:02:16.700 --> 03:02:18.940]  I mean, God is telling me to say this, okay?
[03:02:19.680 --> 03:02:21.219]  And people say, oh yeah, you talk to God.
[03:02:21.340 --> 03:02:22.139]  No, God talks to me.
[03:02:23.399 --> 03:02:24.799]  It's not a two-way thing.
[03:02:24.940 --> 03:02:26.579]  I mean, I don't even attempt it.
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:28.399]  So people say, oh yeah, right, talk to God.
[03:02:28.700 --> 03:02:30.319]  You know, that turns off people that don't believe in God.
[03:02:30.479 --> 03:02:32.540]  Well, God believes in you, and so does the devil.
[03:02:33.589 --> 03:02:34.889]  This force, it's real.
[03:02:35.049 --> 03:02:40.030]  Whatever you want to call it, whatever your view of where it comes from, you need to recognize it because it's the only way to get out of this.
[03:02:40.559 --> 03:02:42.379]  Alright, we're going to go to your phone calls.
[03:02:42.600 --> 03:02:48.500]  Lily, Jared, Pete, Lynn, Randy, Jeff, Mike, Tim, Carlos, Josh, and others.
[03:02:48.639 --> 03:02:50.100]  Carlos has been calling in for 20 years.
[03:02:50.700 --> 03:02:51.899]  We've said his full name on air.
[03:02:52.159 --> 03:02:56.879]  Very statesman, businessman, engineer, very smart guy.
[03:02:57.020 --> 03:02:57.700]  Knows what he's talking about.
[03:02:57.940 --> 03:03:01.879]  I wanted to go to him and talk about Trump won what's next for America.
[03:03:02.719 --> 03:03:04.260]  Carlos, always good to hear from you.
[03:03:04.299 --> 03:03:04.559]  Go ahead.
[03:03:05.860 --> 03:03:06.459]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:03:06.719 --> 03:03:12.360]  I kept quiet for many, many months, not wishing to interfere with your political destiny.
[03:03:12.719 --> 03:03:19.959]  And I want to congratulate InfoWars for your hard work and giving the results to the American people, which is priceless.
[03:03:20.680 --> 03:03:23.299]  Now, having said that, I want to comment on...
[03:03:23.299 --> 03:03:27.219]  I'm not going to go into the mechanics of your election because that is not my place.
[03:03:27.360 --> 03:03:28.280]  I'm Canadian.
[03:03:28.280 --> 03:03:29.059]  I'm not American.
[03:03:29.469 --> 03:03:31.590]  And that's up to you and all to us all.
[03:03:31.809 --> 03:03:46.950]  But with regards to the history of the presidency of the United States, I'd like to point out that President Trump has mentioned that he would, in a way, be modeling his presidency on Republican President William McKinley.
[03:03:47.250 --> 03:03:54.270]  And William McKinley, as people should know, he was a reformer of the political system.
[03:03:54.489 --> 03:04:06.209]  And he, like President Trump, Strengthened and revived the Republican Party that was dominant for decades after his presidency.
[03:04:07.069 --> 03:04:15.670]  And as you know, and people might not know, he's one of the least recognized presidents for being assassinated.
[03:04:15.969 --> 03:04:19.770]  He was assassinated in September 1901.
[03:04:20.209 --> 03:04:32.909]  And in the sense that President Trump We'll now model in the sense of his contribution to American history as much as McKinley did or could go beyond.
[03:04:33.309 --> 03:04:37.229]  I want to remind President Trump that two things.
[03:04:37.370 --> 03:04:49.450]  Number one, he should care for his life and to understand that American presidents in a great percentage, which he didn't state, have been subject to assassination attempts.
[03:04:50.149 --> 03:04:56.309]  Many of the assassination attempts, you and I will discuss another day, have come from the same group of people.
[03:04:56.549 --> 03:05:02.989]  And these people are still extant, and they're capable, able, willing, and they can achieve it.
[03:05:03.190 --> 03:05:14.530]  So I warn President Trump, please, sir, understand that if you don't know enough about history, learn about it, because history is the solution to the problems that face America today.
[03:05:14.930 --> 03:05:32.549]  On the second level, I'd like to say that There's a book that perhaps people don't realize from Carol Quigley, and that great book, brilliant thesis, and simple, it's a very brilliant thesis, is that it's called The Evolution of Civilizations.
[03:05:32.850 --> 03:05:43.709]  And in this book, Carol Quigley, Professor Quigley, mentioned the thesis that organizations develop in societies to serve functions.
[03:05:44.270 --> 03:05:51.569]  And people use these functions and take the grouping or the system forward into what is civilized society.
[03:05:51.850 --> 03:06:00.850]  But in time, there's an inversion that takes place where the people who are supposed to be serviced by these institutions now become reversed.
[03:06:01.049 --> 03:06:04.930]  Now the institutions, you know, use the people to service themselves.
[03:06:05.209 --> 03:06:06.670]  And I think that's what's happened.
[03:06:06.930 --> 03:06:08.909]  You and I talked about inversion before.
[03:06:09.290 --> 03:06:10.610]  This is the inversion we're in.
[03:06:11.010 --> 03:06:22.389]  President Trump should realize in history that the background history to the CIA is that the CIA really does not belong to the United States of America anymore, and the Federal Reserve does.
[03:06:22.709 --> 03:06:30.690]  And that is a lesson in history that has to be understood because it serves the interests of a foreign group of a foreign power.
[03:06:31.030 --> 03:06:32.750]  And that's my last point to you.
[03:06:32.850 --> 03:06:33.950]  And good luck, Alex.
[03:06:34.129 --> 03:06:37.409]  We'll talk about the future of Infowars next time I call.
[03:06:37.870 --> 03:06:38.229]  Thank you.
[03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:54.659]  We're good to go.
[03:07:07.760 --> 03:07:11.579]  The United States taking over the culling stations in the Pacific Ocean, and that's just one of them.
[03:07:11.959 --> 03:07:18.239]  But out of that, by World War II, the U.S. had become the new British Empire.
[03:07:18.440 --> 03:07:21.680]  It had merged into us as a junior with all its infrastructures.
[03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:29.479]  And the CIA with the National Security Act could operate in secret or whatever it wanted to, and it's just expanded out from there.
[03:07:29.520 --> 03:07:31.139]  And you see its policies and what it's done.
[03:07:31.280 --> 03:07:33.899]  You're getting rid of the family, getting us into debt, making us weak.
[03:07:34.909 --> 03:07:38.690]  And the tax-free foundations themselves basically advise and run that.
[03:07:39.569 --> 03:07:42.389]  So the former head of the Carnegie Endowment is the CIA director right now.
[03:07:43.309 --> 03:07:48.069]  And all these policies and plans come out of what we see.
[03:07:48.170 --> 03:07:49.649]  We're going to use a virus to take over.
[03:07:49.809 --> 03:07:52.709]  We're going to shut down the third world and flood the third world here.
[03:07:53.069 --> 03:07:54.610]  We're going to play them off against each other.
[03:07:54.750 --> 03:07:56.649]  We're going to have reverse colonial operations.
[03:07:58.129 --> 03:07:59.309]  People ask how I know all this.
[03:07:59.450 --> 03:08:00.829]  I mean, I read what they put out.
[03:08:01.010 --> 03:08:01.909]  And they don't even hide it.
[03:08:02.030 --> 03:08:06.670]  I mean, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation has come out in FOIA requests.
[03:08:06.750 --> 03:08:10.110]  You know, they're saying 20 years ago, we've got to stop Ron Paul, we've got to stop Alex Jones.
[03:08:10.790 --> 03:08:12.750]  And that's because we were the ones reaching the most people.
[03:08:14.309 --> 03:08:18.370]  And then you get, you know, the last guest in here, and he's quite the buff on that.
[03:08:18.430 --> 03:08:19.110]  He recognizes that.
[03:08:19.170 --> 03:08:20.870]  I mean, that's not about the credit.
[03:08:21.010 --> 03:08:32.290]  It's about understanding where this came from and how we, this audience, I include myself with you, Are seen as the real brain trust of the operation against them.
[03:08:32.629 --> 03:08:33.770]  So it's a big deal.
[03:08:35.329 --> 03:08:37.590]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lily in Washington.
[03:08:37.590 --> 03:08:38.229]  You're on the air.
[03:08:38.350 --> 03:08:38.610]  Go ahead.
[03:08:39.870 --> 03:08:40.889]  Hi, Alex.
[03:08:41.250 --> 03:08:44.209]  I appreciate the chance to speak with you and your audience.
[03:08:44.950 --> 03:08:56.899]  And I just wanted to point out that Scott Bassant, I don't know if I'm saying his name correctly, He's being considered for the Treasury Secretary.
[03:08:57.479 --> 03:09:03.520]  And I didn't know if you were aware that he actually has worked with George Soros for a very long time.
[03:09:03.780 --> 03:09:13.340]  And the fund that he most recently had, his hedge fund, got off the ground with the money of George Soros.
[03:09:14.940 --> 03:09:35.309]  And so I just wanted to point that out and also point out that I'm looking at the Reuters' list of persons that are being considered for various positions, and I'm really disappointed that I don't see Matt Whitaker's name or Doug Collins or people like Ron Johnson.
[03:09:35.489 --> 03:09:42.450]  I mean, they've been really, really, I think, those are people he should consider, I think.
[03:09:43.219 --> 03:09:47.540]  Well, I'm glad you called about this, Lily, because Trump has a problem.
[03:09:47.540 --> 03:09:50.399]  If he tries to not draw from people in the swamp...
[03:09:51.530 --> 03:09:54.069]  Then it's hard, but there are good people that he can do that.
[03:09:54.149 --> 03:09:54.870]  And here's the issue.
[03:09:55.350 --> 03:09:57.510]  Soros is a globalist intelligence frontman.
[03:09:57.729 --> 03:10:01.790]  So basically, most people at one level have done business with him.
[03:10:01.829 --> 03:10:04.329]  And I'm not defending this candidate or this potential candidate.
[03:10:05.209 --> 03:10:06.790]  We should all investigate him.
[03:10:07.010 --> 03:10:10.590]  The really bad ones that we know up front are bad, we should expose.
[03:10:10.790 --> 03:10:13.129]  If bad ones slip in, we should expose them, get them removed.
[03:10:13.329 --> 03:10:20.879]  But this is the real fight in the next 73 days, is making sure that That good people get in.
[03:10:21.020 --> 03:10:24.139]  Trump also has to have people that can get approved by the Senate.
[03:10:24.399 --> 03:10:27.180]  But now that the Republicans have the Senate, that will be easier.
[03:10:27.860 --> 03:10:29.360]  So you're absolutely right.
[03:10:29.540 --> 03:10:30.940]  Trump will be sabotaged.
[03:10:31.059 --> 03:10:33.559]  We will be sabotaged if the bad guys get in.
[03:10:33.659 --> 03:10:41.059]  And so what you're doing now, starting this human intelligence processing of looking at all the candidates and what's going forward and early.
[03:10:41.280 --> 03:10:43.000]  Notice this didn't happen eight years ago.
[03:10:43.690 --> 03:10:47.129]  Getting right up front and looking into it.
[03:10:47.729 --> 03:10:49.770]  But there it is, Washington Post.
[03:10:49.870 --> 03:10:52.110]  A conservative publisher actually had ties to Soros.
[03:10:53.450 --> 03:10:54.610]  Litigation ensued.
[03:10:55.549 --> 03:10:59.329]  But then you've got to ask, and I'm not saying this is the case, oh, the Washington Post is smart.
[03:10:59.329 --> 03:11:07.250]  They're the CIA. If this guy's flipped to us, or he had fights with Soros later, which they're saying, they can go, oh, look, he's Soros.
[03:11:08.100 --> 03:11:13.239]  So that we're against him, but then Trump believes he's actually flipped to us, and we have to be ready for that to happen to it.
[03:11:13.319 --> 03:11:14.139]  I'm not saying that's happened here.
[03:11:14.299 --> 03:11:18.040]  That's why this is going to be a big job, because this is like agents, double agents.
[03:11:18.260 --> 03:11:24.120]  I mean, it's a job, and I'm glad 73 days out, here we are doing it with you right now.
[03:11:24.299 --> 03:11:26.340]  So, anybody else you're concerned about?
[03:11:26.540 --> 03:11:29.899]  I mean, I know they're talking about Pompeo has been up on stage with Trump.
[03:11:30.100 --> 03:11:31.079]  That is insane.
[03:11:31.239 --> 03:11:33.079]  Trump shouldn't get within a thousand miles of that guy.
[03:11:33.510 --> 03:11:34.510]  That's totally insane.
[03:11:34.989 --> 03:11:40.989]  And also, I mean, there's basically very large, financial, powerful people like John Paul Fund.
[03:11:41.090 --> 03:11:43.989]  I mean, these hedge funds have been eating up our country.
[03:11:44.149 --> 03:11:45.590]  They're buying up real estate.
[03:11:45.590 --> 03:11:57.030]  They're hurting the regular average American citizen by what they're doing in real estate and forcing people to rent, buying up homes, forcing to put clothing on people's homes.
[03:11:57.149 --> 03:12:04.159]  I mean, I can't say that the hedge funds these people are attached to are doing that, but the hedge funds have really hurt this country.
[03:12:06.020 --> 03:12:19.459]  Yeah, and of course, Black Rock and State Street, all those guys are one consortium, and they're predatory, and they admit they did the lockdowns to hurt the real economy, to vertically integrate, and they want to put us in a permanent system of this, and you're dead on.
[03:12:19.600 --> 03:12:20.799]  They're not free market.
[03:12:21.079 --> 03:12:23.959]  Why are the states and the pension funds letting them manage the money?
[03:12:24.239 --> 03:12:25.840]  Take the money away from them.
[03:12:26.549 --> 03:12:27.069]  Thank you.
[03:12:27.270 --> 03:12:28.909]  Tim in California, you're on the air.
[03:12:29.010 --> 03:12:29.270]  Go ahead.
[03:12:31.510 --> 03:12:32.850]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[03:12:33.069 --> 03:12:34.049]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:12:34.229 --> 03:12:39.729]  And I watched you guys all the way through all the activity, you know, Tuesday night.
[03:12:39.930 --> 03:12:41.129]  So you guys are outstanding.
[03:12:41.329 --> 03:12:42.209]  The crew's outstanding.
[03:12:42.469 --> 03:12:43.170]  Everything was great.
[03:12:43.350 --> 03:12:44.030]  That was awesome.
[03:12:44.530 --> 03:12:45.149]  Thank you, brother.
[03:12:45.469 --> 03:12:52.170]  But what I called about, you know, at Bill Gates, and I'm thinking Bill Gates versus Elon Musk, you know, a couple of billionaires.
[03:12:52.370 --> 03:12:56.799]  Bill Gates, you know, I don't know if you knew this, he's They're gonna fire up Three Mile Island.
[03:12:56.940 --> 03:13:01.479]  That's been the biggest nuclear disaster site in all of US history.
[03:13:01.739 --> 03:13:03.360]  And they're gonna fire that thing up again.
[03:13:03.500 --> 03:13:09.159]  And he's already bought the contract to all the electricity that comes out of it just so he can fire up his AI stuff.
[03:13:09.579 --> 03:13:10.639]  That kind of stuff.
[03:13:10.840 --> 03:13:19.940]  And he's released untold billions of Of mosquitoes, which, hey man, that is the world's deadliest creatures for all of history.
[03:13:20.180 --> 03:13:24.520]  Those killed untold millions of people all over the earth every single year without fail.
[03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:28.719]  And he's just, you know, creating them in factories like it's fun for him.
[03:13:28.860 --> 03:13:32.520]  And speaking of that, you know, he's bought up all of our farmland.
[03:13:32.700 --> 03:13:38.860]  And now he talks about stopping the sun, or how about vacuuming up all the carbon and putting it in the ground and stuff.
[03:13:39.620 --> 03:13:43.139]  He and his family wanted to kill babies in large part.
[03:13:43.280 --> 03:13:45.200]  He's all about destruction and taking.
[03:13:45.420 --> 03:13:50.680]  Flip that over to the Elon Musk side of this equation.
[03:13:50.739 --> 03:13:52.500]  It's all about creation.
[03:13:52.920 --> 03:13:54.680]  It's all about giving.
[03:13:55.159 --> 03:13:57.780]  It's all about we need more babies.
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:06.139]  It's not about these vaccines where we're going to sicken all the kids all over the world just so I can make my money.
[03:14:06.569 --> 03:14:09.229]  Or release all these mosquitoes so you'll need me more.
[03:14:09.829 --> 03:14:25.430]  No, instead, when somebody really did need somebody, like the people in North Carolina when that flood stuff came in and the hurricane thing came in, hey, one called Elon Musk, we need you to release this internet over the sky that you've created.
[03:14:25.430 --> 03:14:26.969]  Please do this to help us.
[03:14:27.110 --> 03:14:29.329]  And, bing, just in an instant, he did it.
[03:14:31.469 --> 03:14:34.610]  Well, sure, let me comment on that.
[03:14:36.359 --> 03:14:38.959]  Yeah, Musk says we need a bigger population.
[03:14:38.959 --> 03:14:39.819]  He's pro-human.
[03:14:40.079 --> 03:14:43.420]  Bill Gates is openly engaged in all these supervillain crimes.
[03:14:43.459 --> 03:14:46.600]  It sounds like it's a Marvel comic plot, but it's really going on.
[03:14:46.659 --> 03:14:49.059]  And now you've had Musk for years openly attacking Gates.
[03:14:49.360 --> 03:14:50.940]  Trump now going after him.
[03:14:51.139 --> 03:14:53.559]  This is a beautiful moment.
[03:14:53.780 --> 03:14:55.780]  And yes, Google...
[03:14:58.670 --> 03:15:02.409]  Amazon, Gates, they're all not just firing up Three Mile Island.
[03:15:02.530 --> 03:15:06.049]  Well, they moved to cut off our fossil fuels, our natural gas, our energy.
[03:15:06.690 --> 03:15:08.930]  They're not just firing up old reactors.
[03:15:09.090 --> 03:15:13.030]  They're firing up all these mini-reactors where they get energy, but we don't.
[03:15:13.270 --> 03:15:14.809]  And see, that's the plan.
[03:15:14.969 --> 03:15:16.010]  That's the neo-feudalism.
[03:15:16.090 --> 03:15:16.610]  Thanks for the call.
[03:15:16.709 --> 03:15:17.430]  Incredible points.
[03:15:18.389 --> 03:15:19.709]  Yeah, Bill Gates needs to go to prison.
[03:15:20.030 --> 03:15:21.549]  Jeff in Georgia, you're on the air.
[03:15:21.629 --> 03:15:21.930]  Go ahead.
[03:15:24.389 --> 03:15:25.030]  Yes, sir.
[03:15:26.049 --> 03:15:27.170]  Third time caller.
[03:15:28.159 --> 03:15:44.040]  I got a few kids, and in the last few days, it was expressed to me that three out of the four oldest were totally anti-Trump, and it just feels like the future,
[03:15:44.540 --> 03:15:53.159]  four years from now, considering two of these four kids are going to be able to vote, is not looking like we thought it would.
[03:15:54.040 --> 03:16:02.379]  I'm still concerned, as I called a few weeks ago, I'm still concerned about what the future has to bring.
[03:16:02.799 --> 03:16:04.200]  Well, we got to educate people.
[03:16:04.299 --> 03:16:05.100]  We got to inform people.
[03:16:05.180 --> 03:16:07.620]  And one thing about kids is they're getting brainwashed at school.
[03:16:07.979 --> 03:16:10.639]  So you need to talk to them and show them how they're wrong and deprogram them.
[03:16:10.760 --> 03:16:11.440]  That's your job.
[03:16:12.139 --> 03:16:22.319]  But yeah, but right now we got to get rid of the deep state, cut off the propaganda just by not supporting it and not having the government secretly run it illegally and get free speech back, not just on X, but everywhere.
[03:16:22.780 --> 03:16:24.840]  And we'll fix that problem, Jeff.
[03:16:26.739 --> 03:16:35.079]  Yeah, I just, like, I tried to teach them to be free thinkers, and I tried to teach them, like, okay, you're not in history unless you're there.
[03:16:35.399 --> 03:16:36.420]  Everything else is propaganda.
[03:16:36.899 --> 03:16:45.399]  But it just seems like the school system still has such a 99% grasp on their development, if you know what I mean.
[03:16:45.479 --> 03:16:45.899]  No, you're right.
[03:16:45.959 --> 03:16:47.239]  And we've got to address the problem and move forward.
[03:16:47.340 --> 03:16:48.200]  And that's what you've done.
[03:16:48.360 --> 03:16:49.780]  So we've got to talk about the problem.
[03:16:49.840 --> 03:16:50.459]  Let's fix it now.
[03:16:50.739 --> 03:16:52.040]  I mean, say, hey, I'm your dad.
[03:16:53.539 --> 03:16:54.559]  Show them the evidence.
[03:16:54.940 --> 03:16:55.600]  Explain to them.
[03:16:55.700 --> 03:17:02.879]  Say, these people, you know, they've set it up where people don't have enough money to get their kids educated somewhere properly, and explain to them they're brainwashing them.
[03:17:03.280 --> 03:17:04.979]  And, you know, you've got to do it early.
[03:17:05.100 --> 03:17:06.959]  You shouldn't put them in public school, but I know it's hard.
[03:17:07.520 --> 03:17:08.600]  We just got to do the best we can.
[03:17:08.639 --> 03:17:09.079]  Stay with us.
[03:17:09.510 --> 03:17:20.610]  As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm dark MAGA. A few weeks ago, when I saw Elon Musk in Pennsylvania with Trump at Butler, and he had that dark MAGA hat on, I said, we've got to have our own.
[03:17:20.889 --> 03:17:22.110]  And we've come out with it.
[03:17:22.590 --> 03:17:27.430]  Yeah, we can put one out that, you know, just says, Make America Great Again, and that's available at TheAlexShowStore.com.
[03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:29.090]  But I personally like this one.
[03:17:29.670 --> 03:17:34.350]  Murdered out, it fits great, and it funds the info war and supports President Trump.
[03:17:34.819 --> 03:17:37.420]  And if you don't like Murdered Out, we got it white on black.
[03:17:37.620 --> 03:17:47.659]  So get yours right now and a bunch of other great designs of hoodies and t-shirts and top of the line supplements that all fund the second American Revolution at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:17:47.739 --> 03:17:48.600]  Let me show you a few more of these.
[03:17:48.799 --> 03:17:55.280]  Now that the FDA admits fluoride does lower your IQ and give you cancer and infertility, it's a great time to wear one of these beautiful hats.
[03:17:55.530 --> 03:17:57.829]  And it's a great way to start a conversation and warn people.
[03:17:58.030 --> 03:18:00.590]  Here's the classic Make America Great Again Murdered Out.
[03:18:00.770 --> 03:18:04.370]  And we've got the Save the Frogs, over 50 designs, all at thealexshowstore.com.
[03:18:04.450 --> 03:18:06.329]  And it keeps us on air and it spreads the word.

[03:18:09.229 --> 03:18:12.930]  All right, I'm going right back to your phone calls, interspersed with some clips and news and breaking information.
[03:18:12.930 --> 03:18:14.309]  But I want to just say this right now.
[03:18:15.090 --> 03:18:20.409]  We're fundraising in case we're shut down next Wednesday when InfoWars is on the chopping block and the bad guys say they're going to buy it.
[03:18:20.469 --> 03:18:21.149]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[03:18:21.229 --> 03:18:21.809]  I'm praying about it.
[03:18:21.829 --> 03:18:22.549]  I hope we stay here.
[03:18:22.909 --> 03:18:24.329]  Hope the good guys are able to buy it.
[03:18:25.290 --> 03:18:26.629]  But we're not going to just give up.
[03:18:26.790 --> 03:18:31.430]  So backup studios, websites, satellite uplink, servers, crew, all that takes money.
[03:18:31.549 --> 03:18:32.389]  Legal to keep fighting.
[03:18:32.809 --> 03:18:33.850]  We're winning, by the way.
[03:18:33.930 --> 03:18:35.110]  That's why you don't see it in the news right now.

[03:18:58.979 --> 03:19:03.159]  With the biggest sale yet, they just launched the Trump One Ultimate Victory Bundles.
[03:19:03.280 --> 03:19:15.559]  There's three tiers of it, where you get all the Trump gear, all the supplements, a whole bunch of bottles of each supplement, stock up on it, and have it, and support us now, and get a great discount.
[03:19:15.899 --> 03:19:17.700]  These are insane deals.

[03:19:23.379 --> 03:19:26.979]  Or you can get one t-shirt or one ball cap.
[03:19:27.079 --> 03:19:27.399]  That's great.
[03:19:27.600 --> 03:19:34.079]  But if you really want to support and get a great deal, there's three tiers of these where you're saving over 60%.
[03:19:34.079 --> 03:19:43.260]  And so we're talking about a bundle of That would be, and we can put up on screen, guys, the actual, just go to the alexjonesstore.com.
[03:19:43.360 --> 03:19:46.340]  This was printed for me so small I can't read it.
[03:19:46.860 --> 03:19:53.680]  But, you know, we're talking about a $1,000 plus cost for the mega bundle, and you're getting it for $524.
[03:19:54.440 --> 03:19:57.620]  So that's a $1,649 value for the biggest bundle.
[03:19:57.739 --> 03:19:58.219]  It's huge.
[03:19:58.920 --> 03:20:00.600]  For $524.97.
[03:20:00.840 --> 03:20:04.500]  We basically almost make no money on this, but I guess the thought behind it is you're going to love it and get it again.
[03:20:05.350 --> 03:20:08.209]  That's three packs of everything and all the clothes.
[03:20:08.530 --> 03:20:12.409]  And they got the other packs.
[03:20:12.629 --> 03:20:14.069]  So if you get the biggest pack, it's 50%.
[03:20:17.799 --> 03:20:21.920]  That's $1,049 value for $524.
[03:20:22.860 --> 03:20:25.020]  You get the two pack of everything.
[03:20:25.440 --> 03:20:28.840]  That's a $699 value for $384.

[03:20:53.440 --> 03:20:54.639]  So thank you so much.
[03:20:55.979 --> 03:21:06.079]  Check it all out right now, thealexshonestore.com and everybody, if you're going to buy anything, you should become a VIP, pay 30 bucks, boom, 50 bucks, 40 bucks, put in your account right then.
[03:21:07.010 --> 03:21:08.370]  And you're making $10 on that.
[03:21:08.809 --> 03:21:09.450]  What a deal.
[03:21:09.549 --> 03:21:11.590]  You gotta get the CMOS. You gotta get the HydroForce.
[03:21:11.629 --> 03:21:12.549]  You gotta get the gut cleanse.
[03:21:12.670 --> 03:21:13.469]  You gotta get the gummies.
[03:21:13.690 --> 03:21:14.750]  You gotta get the t-shirts.
[03:21:14.889 --> 03:21:16.250]  The new designs are amazing.
[03:21:16.770 --> 03:21:17.469]  I'm done plugging.
[03:21:17.750 --> 03:21:18.610]  Thank you for your support.
[03:21:19.110 --> 03:21:19.389]  Alright.
[03:21:21.229 --> 03:21:22.290]  I got a bunch of calls.
[03:21:22.370 --> 03:21:22.930]  Loaded lines here.
[03:21:22.950 --> 03:21:23.750]  And I want to go back to your calls.
[03:21:23.829 --> 03:21:25.090]  But I gotta go to some of these clips.
[03:21:26.329 --> 03:21:28.290]  The first one I want to play is Candace Owens.
[03:21:28.409 --> 03:21:29.049]  This has gone viral.
[03:21:29.430 --> 03:21:31.469]  And it trended on X this morning.
[03:21:32.069 --> 03:21:33.110]  I'm like looking at the trend.
[03:21:33.250 --> 03:21:35.370]  I'm like, oh, Alex Jones is press secretary.
[03:21:35.969 --> 03:21:36.989]  And Don Jr.
[03:21:37.110 --> 03:21:37.989]  has talked about this.
[03:21:38.590 --> 03:21:45.510]  And I'm actually told as a troll that they're going to be bringing a bunch of people through.
[03:21:46.049 --> 03:21:47.010]  Rotating people through.
[03:21:47.250 --> 03:21:49.229]  So I'm actually told this is serious.
[03:21:49.469 --> 03:21:51.129]  And I'm going to get a phone call about it.
[03:21:54.760 --> 03:21:58.120]  I mean, it would be fun to tell the corporate press they're fake and get in their face.
[03:21:58.239 --> 03:22:00.200]  And I'm supposedly the ultimate demon other than Trump.
[03:22:00.500 --> 03:22:05.200]  And to show them that none of their programming or them dictating who we like and who we support works.
[03:22:05.340 --> 03:22:07.379]  To show all their lies about me are a lie.
[03:22:07.520 --> 03:22:08.319]  To double down.
[03:22:08.479 --> 03:22:09.719]  That's the smart maverick move.
[03:22:09.799 --> 03:22:11.819]  And yes, I would be happy for a month.
[03:22:11.840 --> 03:22:16.520]  I don't want to do it more than that and be in D.C. I would go do press conferences every day and I would destroy them.
[03:22:17.200 --> 03:22:19.440]  And then they would attack me and it would blow up in their face.
[03:22:19.559 --> 03:22:20.360]  And it's a great idea.
[03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:21.319]  Yeah.
[03:22:22.709 --> 03:22:25.530]  I thought it was a joke, you know, whenever Don's talked about it quite a bit.
[03:22:25.590 --> 03:22:26.969]  He said, you know, just for a week or a month.
[03:22:27.389 --> 03:22:31.610]  And now I'm told they're understanding being the Mavericks, being, quote, radical.
[03:22:31.770 --> 03:22:32.309]  We're not radical.
[03:22:32.430 --> 03:22:33.329]  They're the ones that are radical.
[03:22:33.530 --> 03:22:42.309]  They say the people that don't want open borders and child trafficking and World War III and devalued dollars and the New World Order and social credit scores and cashless societies, we're crazy.
[03:22:42.450 --> 03:22:43.190]  You know, they're crazy.
[03:22:44.469 --> 03:22:49.149]  If Trump wins three days ago, he said the world government won't, people won't swear allegiance to it.
[03:22:49.809 --> 03:22:50.950]  And then he's the normal one?
[03:22:51.229 --> 03:22:52.670]  No humans will be in the future?
[03:22:52.690 --> 03:22:53.569]  The future's not human?
[03:22:53.590 --> 03:22:54.590]  No, I'm the normal one.
[03:22:54.649 --> 03:22:55.270]  You're the normal one.
[03:22:55.590 --> 03:23:00.770]  So yeah, it's the ultimate double down, the ultimate your trance is broken.
[03:23:02.309 --> 03:23:03.930]  And of course, that's why Don Jr.
[03:23:04.129 --> 03:23:05.170]  said he's not even joking.
[03:23:05.409 --> 03:23:06.829]  So here's Candace Owens on that.
[03:23:06.870 --> 03:23:08.149]  It's bigger than me, but yeah.
[03:23:10.250 --> 03:23:18.989]  Electing Trump to spot all their election fraud and all their censorship and all their control and 95% of the corporate money going to Kamala Harris, that broke their will.
[03:23:19.110 --> 03:23:24.149]  And that showed other people who've been under the intimidation and the bullying to stop caring about that.
[03:23:24.170 --> 03:23:26.290]  And that's the final thing to free in our minds.
[03:23:26.870 --> 03:23:30.190]  I mean, the ultimate example of that happens in the real world all the time.
[03:23:30.290 --> 03:23:34.450]  But in V for Vendetta, it turns out he's had her in what she thinks is a jail cell.
[03:23:35.969 --> 03:23:41.129]  To, you know, make her think she's finally going to die and she doesn't give up and she goes, go ahead and kill me.
[03:23:41.770 --> 03:23:42.909]  He says, now you're free.
[03:23:43.309 --> 03:23:44.750]  And that's what this is.
[03:23:44.909 --> 03:23:48.229]  So, electing Trump, that's already been done.
[03:23:48.610 --> 03:23:52.270]  But yeah, I've been invited to Mar-a-Lago and I could have got Trump on all this stuff.
[03:23:53.190 --> 03:23:58.850]  And when the people talked about it, I said, you know, it might be a distraction now because they've demonized me so much, it'll divert away.
[03:23:59.170 --> 03:24:04.870]  But I said, once he's president-elect, once he's the president, sure, because it's good to show the system.
[03:24:04.989 --> 03:24:06.950]  See, the guy you said at the very worst, you failed.
[03:24:07.110 --> 03:24:08.350]  The people know that's not true.
[03:24:08.530 --> 03:24:11.030]  We put Trump in, and now we support Alex Jones.
[03:24:12.459 --> 03:24:15.100]  But that's only because it's important to do that.
[03:24:15.299 --> 03:24:16.540]  It's not about me.
[03:24:16.799 --> 03:24:20.520]  What matters is we stay on the air and continue to analyze what's happening.
[03:24:20.639 --> 03:24:22.219]  But here's Candace Owens on the subject.
[03:24:22.540 --> 03:24:24.340]  Very clear about Alex Jones.
[03:24:25.479 --> 03:24:31.780]  I will crawl over broken glass and give him everything I earn.
[03:24:31.979 --> 03:24:35.959]  If all he needs is someone to pay the salary, leave it to me.
[03:24:36.389 --> 03:24:36.850]  Leave it to me.
[03:24:37.149 --> 03:24:40.729]  I'll get a second job to pay, whatever salary he wants to be the press secretary.
[03:24:40.909 --> 03:24:43.670]  If he's like, I'm gonna need half a million dollars a year, leave it to me.
[03:24:43.989 --> 03:24:45.610]  Like I said, I will pick up a job.
[03:24:45.809 --> 03:24:46.770]  I will raise the money.
[03:24:46.889 --> 03:24:49.889]  It'll be totally fine if we get Alex Jones.
[03:24:49.950 --> 03:24:50.690]  We are not worthy.
[03:24:50.850 --> 03:24:51.790]  We are not worthy.
[03:24:51.889 --> 03:24:54.350]  But Trump, please, it would be the greatest troll.
[03:24:54.590 --> 03:24:56.649]  And by the way, he is more than equipped for it.
[03:24:56.709 --> 03:24:58.290]  He has run a show for decades.
[03:24:59.090 --> 03:25:01.229]  All he does is talk and answer and respond to questions.
[03:25:01.350 --> 03:25:02.889]  He is totally equipped from it and they hate him.
[03:25:03.129 --> 03:25:06.370]  The deep state hates Alex Jones with a vengeance.
[03:25:06.809 --> 03:25:09.889]  X-Smokes writes, Candace, you should be Trump's press secretary.
[03:25:09.989 --> 03:25:14.129]  Look, I would be very good at that job, but come on, Alex Jones?
[03:25:14.290 --> 03:25:17.469]  There could be no one better suited for that job that would make us happier.
[03:25:17.510 --> 03:25:21.309]  We would be watching press briefings every single day like it was Game of Thrones.
[03:25:21.549 --> 03:25:24.889]  We'd just be in seasons of Game of Thrones watching Alex Jones respond to the press.
[03:25:25.010 --> 03:25:26.370]  So that is my vote.
[03:25:27.750 --> 03:25:30.690]  It is a great idea, but I think I do it for a month.
[03:25:31.329 --> 03:25:33.069]  Candace Owens does it for a month.
[03:25:37.309 --> 03:25:39.190]  Elon Musk for a month, but he's too busy.
[03:25:39.489 --> 03:25:41.090]  I mean, yeah, no, I would...
[03:25:41.090 --> 03:25:46.950]  What's crazy is people are breaking the system's brainwashing conditioning so much that now this is serious.
[03:25:47.450 --> 03:25:49.290]  This trended at the top of X today.
[03:25:51.350 --> 03:25:51.750]  So...
[03:25:51.750 --> 03:25:54.250]  I hate DC, but I'd do it.
[03:25:55.520 --> 03:25:56.399]  Absolutely in a minute.
[03:25:57.219 --> 03:26:02.799]  And, you know, I'd invite the press in, host the show for three, four hours in front of them.
[03:26:03.360 --> 03:26:04.280]  Hell, bring them on as guests.
[03:26:04.920 --> 03:26:08.940]  And then, okay, now you're going to get a two-hour press briefing, and I'm going to destroy you.
[03:26:10.159 --> 03:26:12.200]  And it's just, can you imagine?
[03:26:13.739 --> 03:26:14.559]  I like it.
[03:26:14.899 --> 03:26:15.620]  I like it.
[03:26:15.780 --> 03:26:17.139]  Hey, God, if you want it, do it.
[03:26:17.979 --> 03:26:18.840]  It's your will, God.
[03:26:19.559 --> 03:26:22.479]  But very, very exciting.
[03:26:22.600 --> 03:26:23.159]  Very, very fun.
[03:26:24.020 --> 03:26:24.540]  All right.
[03:26:25.879 --> 03:26:29.760]  Let's go to clip 16 from yesterday with Kamala.
[03:26:31.440 --> 03:26:36.319]  And she says, only when it's dark enough can you see the stars reading up a teleprompter.
[03:26:36.799 --> 03:26:42.719]  America, let us fill the sky with the light of brilliant billions of stars.
[03:26:44.559 --> 03:26:47.760]  So, she says, you saw it probably in parts of it.
[03:26:47.959 --> 03:26:51.979]  She says, yes, I capitulate, but I will still fight him and he's still evil.
[03:26:52.219 --> 03:26:58.559]  And basically, Biden said that too after his wife probably voted for him and he put on the MAGA hat and she wore a red dress voting.
[03:26:58.700 --> 03:26:59.819]  I mean, that's definitely a message there.
[03:26:59.979 --> 03:27:01.899]  So, They're routed.
[03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:02.760]  They're scared.
[03:27:02.959 --> 03:27:03.659]  They're crazy.
[03:27:04.540 --> 03:27:05.899]  They don't know what to do.
[03:27:06.159 --> 03:27:15.399]  And if Trump and the rest of us get in a position of letting the corporate media still get us off balance and respond to them and care what they say, this is not going to go as good as it could.
[03:27:15.819 --> 03:27:17.680]  I mean, nothing will put them back together again.
[03:27:17.940 --> 03:27:20.260]  I mean, here's the deal.
[03:27:20.420 --> 03:27:26.030]  If Trump tried to sell out, which he wouldn't, And tried to go against this, it would just piss people off more.
[03:27:26.190 --> 03:27:28.649]  I mean, you do not put this genie back in the bottle.
[03:27:29.149 --> 03:27:34.350]  Unless Satan can convince his minions to blow the earth up, I don't think God's going to let that happen at this point.
[03:27:34.709 --> 03:27:35.790]  Satan's not in full control.
[03:27:38.239 --> 03:27:39.520]  So, and that's very biblical.
[03:27:39.700 --> 03:27:41.500]  Old and New Testaments, it's there.
[03:27:42.139 --> 03:27:48.520]  And, you know, the God, literally Satan comes in front of God and asks for permission to be able to do this and that.
[03:27:49.020 --> 03:27:50.280]  And a lot of times God says no.
[03:27:50.379 --> 03:27:52.979]  Sometimes God says, yeah, they've not been, you know, heeding the warnings.
[03:27:53.139 --> 03:27:53.379]  Go ahead.
[03:27:53.440 --> 03:27:54.120]  You can be in control.
[03:27:54.840 --> 03:27:56.520]  So, you know, that's there.
[03:27:57.159 --> 03:27:58.280]  Satan is not in full control.
[03:27:58.360 --> 03:28:02.139]  So he's the prince and power of the air and the governments and the systems, but...
[03:28:02.760 --> 03:28:05.399]  God is the ultimate arbiter and of course is in full control there.
[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:07.459]  Let's go to Mike in New Jersey.
[03:28:07.659 --> 03:28:09.260]  I said I'd play the Kamala clip, here it is.
[03:28:10.299 --> 03:28:14.799]  When it is dark enough, can you see the stars?
[03:28:17.000 --> 03:28:21.260]  I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time.
[03:28:22.620 --> 03:28:27.399]  But for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case.
[03:28:27.719 --> 03:28:38.600]  But here's the thing, America, if it is, Let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars.
[03:28:40.840 --> 03:28:51.620]  The light of optimism, of faith, of truth, and service.
[03:28:55.210 --> 03:29:07.889]  So, what they do is, as you know, is they have the supposed leader, the puppet, always optimism, love, we're together, and then all their surrogates, we're dead, it's over, they're gonna kill us, the world's screwed up, humans are bad, depopulate the earth, don't have children.
[03:29:08.370 --> 03:29:11.409]  And then she's like, I know you're scared, because we scared you.
[03:29:11.829 --> 03:29:15.450]  But, you know, we just gotta be optimistic and we'll fix things.
[03:29:16.430 --> 03:29:18.909]  Mike in New Jersey, thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[03:29:20.500 --> 03:29:23.520]  Hey Alex, there was two things I wanted to cover with you.
[03:29:23.659 --> 03:29:26.620]  The second being a question I have for you regarding fundraising.
[03:29:27.520 --> 03:29:33.030]  Foremost, I've viewed the election results with cautious optimism.
[03:29:33.809 --> 03:30:00.979]  In other words, while the conservative movement did manage to come out of the election with pretty substantial control over all three branches of government, I think the time has really come to hold our politicians' feet to the fire and demand answers and action to the very many Inconsistencies with our current government.
[03:30:01.260 --> 03:30:10.500]  My question to you is what steps do you recommend that we take now to be fully ready to demand such action?
[03:30:11.059 --> 03:30:13.280]  Well, we don't just run around celebrating the victory.
[03:30:13.680 --> 03:30:15.520]  We look at everybody Trump's bringing in.
[03:30:15.659 --> 03:30:17.620]  As soon as it looks bad, we expose the person.
[03:30:17.739 --> 03:30:19.840]  We nominate publicly good people.
[03:30:20.120 --> 03:30:21.860]  We protect Trump until he gets in.
[03:30:22.260 --> 03:30:25.540]  When they try to stir up riots or false flags, we expose them.
[03:30:26.280 --> 03:30:34.840]  And we just continue to educate others and continue to be open about what we support and not be bullied and stop keeping our information, our light to ourselves.
[03:30:35.079 --> 03:30:36.540]  Got to be light in the world, as Christ said.
[03:30:38.390 --> 03:30:42.430]  And we need to, you know, like I said, find the missing children.
[03:30:42.590 --> 03:30:43.469]  Don't just shut down the border.
[03:30:43.569 --> 03:30:44.989]  Don't just deport the criminal gangs.
[03:30:45.110 --> 03:30:46.069]  Just don't deport the military.
[03:30:46.290 --> 03:30:50.690]  Man, Trump needs to say we're going to find the missing children and prosecute those involved.
[03:30:50.969 --> 03:30:55.090]  And then that moral high ground, right thing to do, puts the enemy on their back foot.
[03:30:55.250 --> 03:30:59.790]  They use the human trafficking and sex slavery as their secret currency of control and blackmail.
[03:30:59.829 --> 03:31:03.809]  So you attack the heart of their control system and do the right thing at the same time.
[03:31:03.809 --> 03:31:04.370]  So you do that.
[03:31:04.899 --> 03:31:09.780]  You go in and say the money's cut off and NATO's not going to take over Ukraine.
[03:31:10.100 --> 03:31:11.079]  It's going to be neutral.
[03:31:11.260 --> 03:31:12.239]  Putin signs the agreement.
[03:31:13.139 --> 03:31:14.719]  And then that gets shut down.
[03:31:15.180 --> 03:31:17.579]  You stop the Iran war, dial that back.
[03:31:18.239 --> 03:31:19.819]  You stabilize the currency.
[03:31:20.239 --> 03:31:22.940]  You tell everybody that business is welcome back in America.
[03:31:22.940 --> 03:31:24.079]  You crank up the energy.
[03:31:24.239 --> 03:31:25.040]  That lowers prices.
[03:31:25.200 --> 03:31:28.159]  That will mitigate inflation, but it's already so out of control.
[03:31:28.559 --> 03:31:31.229]  Trump even said you can't End it.
[03:31:31.350 --> 03:31:42.530]  The prices are up now, but you just stop the increase or slow it and then just create a massive new innovation that they've been suppressing and then turn that loose.
[03:31:42.969 --> 03:31:45.909]  And so that's basically part of what we do.
[03:31:46.149 --> 03:31:47.610]  And I've been hammering that.
[03:31:47.709 --> 03:31:48.129]  Does that make sense?
[03:31:49.030 --> 03:31:50.290]  It makes perfect sense.
[03:31:50.610 --> 03:31:59.530]  My second question, Alex, is would you ever consider doing an in-person event for the purpose of fundraising for Infowars?
[03:32:00.120 --> 03:32:07.780]  Something with speakers and merch sales and all of the proceeds go to Infowars.
[03:32:08.299 --> 03:32:09.879]  Yeah, I mean, I would do something like that.
[03:32:09.979 --> 03:32:10.659]  I appreciate your call.
[03:32:10.739 --> 03:32:11.299]  I mean, here's the deal.
[03:32:12.399 --> 03:32:14.860]  I've been working 16, 18 hours a day for months.
[03:32:15.879 --> 03:32:21.200]  And I've had to spend a lot of my time, you know, trying to go around scrounge up money.
[03:32:22.379 --> 03:32:33.239]  And Again, more than 50% of the money that comes in, for me personally, in the operation, goes to the legal.
[03:32:33.399 --> 03:32:37.180]  Because there's a bunch of huge fights going on, and we blocked them, we beat them, they're really pissed off.
[03:32:37.600 --> 03:32:39.319]  And there's a whole bunch of other great stuff happening.
[03:32:41.280 --> 03:32:46.360]  And then the rest goes into satellites, all the stuff that goes into that, and the servers and the rest of it.
[03:32:47.909 --> 03:32:49.389]  We're doing okay.
[03:32:50.250 --> 03:32:54.209]  We have enough to launch if we're shut down next week.
[03:32:54.690 --> 03:33:00.790]  It's just that I don't like running on, okay, I've got a gallon of gas and I've got to go 25 miles.
[03:33:01.629 --> 03:33:05.069]  And this much gas, you know, the indicator says we'll get me 25 miles.
[03:33:05.850 --> 03:33:12.959]  And then because I'm stressed out by that, I have to spend my time on that, like some of my time today.
[03:33:13.180 --> 03:33:20.120]  I'd rather shoot special reports and analyze information that will reach tens of millions of people conservatively, but it draws me away.
[03:33:20.979 --> 03:33:30.600]  So getting on a plane, going somewhere for a fundraiser, most of the time costs most of the money of the trip and the people in the event.
[03:33:31.840 --> 03:33:36.399]  So I appreciate your call, but I don't see how that does it.
[03:33:39.129 --> 03:33:40.629]  We have a gigantic audience.
[03:33:41.069 --> 03:33:42.430]  Less than 1% ever buys anything.
[03:33:42.530 --> 03:33:44.430]  And people just go, hey man, this is the thing to bet on.
[03:33:44.649 --> 03:33:45.709]  The bad guys want this off the air.
[03:33:45.870 --> 03:33:48.450]  It's defending you to support the broadcast.
[03:33:48.450 --> 03:33:49.350]  And I'm not bitching.
[03:33:49.930 --> 03:33:56.209]  It's just that if 3% of the audience bought something once a year, I'd plug once a year.
[03:33:56.469 --> 03:33:58.110]  Instead, it's a fraction of 1%.
[03:33:58.110 --> 03:33:58.649]  Because I get it.
[03:33:58.690 --> 03:33:59.469]  The media is everywhere.
[03:33:59.770 --> 03:34:02.069]  People take this subconsciously just like another show.
[03:34:02.780 --> 03:34:03.639]  Not the tip of the spear.
[03:34:03.739 --> 03:34:05.600]  Not the thing the enemy hates more than anything other than Trump.
[03:34:06.139 --> 03:34:08.360]  People get Trump so they donated to him.
[03:34:08.520 --> 03:34:10.319]  The enemy's still outspending, but it was enough.
[03:34:10.459 --> 03:34:15.899]  It took him billions, billions of his own money and billions, billions to barely beat these people.
[03:34:16.600 --> 03:34:18.059]  So, you know, whatever.
[03:34:18.059 --> 03:34:18.840]  I'm not complaining.
[03:34:19.000 --> 03:34:22.379]  It's just the nature of there being so much media.
[03:34:23.389 --> 03:34:24.770]  That people just still hear.
[03:34:24.909 --> 03:34:27.049]  They're like, yeah, okay, I'm hearing a guy say this, you know, whatever.
[03:34:27.569 --> 03:34:28.069]  Okay, fine.
[03:34:28.250 --> 03:34:30.350]  But it's the action on this.
[03:34:30.409 --> 03:34:31.750]  This is not a normal show.
[03:34:32.149 --> 03:34:33.829]  This is attacked by the new world.
[03:34:33.950 --> 03:34:35.129]  People are like, well, I see all the other shows.
[03:34:35.229 --> 03:34:36.670]  They got some ads and asked for money.
[03:34:36.770 --> 03:34:38.590]  But why is this guy money, money, money, money, money, money?
[03:34:38.750 --> 03:34:43.209]  I mean, I've got the Democratic Party spent $80 million the last six, seven years.
[03:34:43.569 --> 03:34:44.370]  It's in the news.
[03:34:44.610 --> 03:34:45.809]  It's up at $80 million now.
[03:34:46.209 --> 03:34:48.389]  I've spent $15 million fighting back.
[03:34:49.510 --> 03:34:51.170]  And my dad spent $2 million.
[03:34:51.170 --> 03:34:53.750]  They sued him just because I was in business with him with a supplement company.
[03:34:53.989 --> 03:34:54.690]  He's out of money.
[03:34:54.770 --> 03:34:55.809]  He's backs against the wall.
[03:34:56.350 --> 03:34:58.069]  He didn't tell the family any of this stuff.
[03:34:58.090 --> 03:34:59.270]  I just discovered it by...
[03:34:59.270 --> 03:35:00.850]  I was like, why is my mom stressed out?
[03:35:00.909 --> 03:35:01.329]  What's going on?
[03:35:01.370 --> 03:35:02.450]  Oh, they're out of town visiting family?
[03:35:02.569 --> 03:35:03.389]  I dug through the stuff.
[03:35:04.059 --> 03:35:05.979]  And, you know, and that's how they get you.
[03:35:06.559 --> 03:35:08.079]  And so it pisses me off.
[03:35:08.819 --> 03:35:14.959]  And so I don't even have the money, and I'll be honest with you, if I got a big donation or stuff, my dad's key to all this, and his supplement company's great.
[03:35:15.360 --> 03:35:18.319]  I mean, if I had plenty of money, actually, I'd go help my dad.
[03:35:18.500 --> 03:35:22.260]  I mean, the wolves have got me, you know...
[03:35:22.819 --> 03:35:23.520]  Run to ground.
[03:35:23.700 --> 03:35:25.620]  And I'm having more success ever in the infowars.
[03:35:25.700 --> 03:35:30.739]  I'm up here broadcasting, fighting, hitting home runs, holes in ones, thanks to all your support.
[03:35:31.040 --> 03:35:35.799]  And what we've done over the years, we're hitting just like by light years, the most important work we've ever done.
[03:35:36.700 --> 03:35:40.340]  And then there's the paradox that the wolves are, it's like I'm up on a boulder.
[03:35:40.920 --> 03:35:42.280]  It's eight feet tall and the wolves are...
[03:35:44.149 --> 03:35:44.930]  You know, like this.
[03:35:45.090 --> 03:35:46.549]  And I'm just still broadcasting.
[03:35:47.049 --> 03:35:50.450]  They're snapping and bit my foot and, you know, dragging my family down.
[03:35:50.569 --> 03:35:52.190]  And they're eating my family in front of me.
[03:35:52.250 --> 03:35:53.950]  And I'm just like, well, all right.
[03:35:54.829 --> 03:35:59.709]  You know, my parents are like, when I confronted them with it, they're like, hey, we don't want to bother you.
[03:35:59.790 --> 03:36:00.170]  It's okay.
[03:36:00.329 --> 03:36:01.110]  Just fight harder.
[03:36:01.989 --> 03:36:03.149]  And I'm just like, wow.
[03:36:03.750 --> 03:36:06.690]  You know, I mean, it's just, it's just disgusting.
[03:36:08.010 --> 03:36:13.569]  I mean, they've deposed my dad like eight times, harassed a living hell and called him a criminal on all the news, said he got hundreds of millions of hidden money.
[03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:14.329]  None of it was true.
[03:36:15.709 --> 03:36:17.110]  They've been suing him for two years.
[03:36:17.829 --> 03:36:21.090]  And it's just, that's what they do.
[03:36:21.670 --> 03:36:26.329]  But I mean, the difference is, is my parents are like, we want you to fight harder.
[03:36:26.629 --> 03:36:29.809]  We don't want you to back down one millisecond.
[03:36:30.579 --> 03:36:38.180]  And so, again, the globalists think terrorizing my family, and there's been a lot of other stuff, too, is going to do something.
[03:36:38.299 --> 03:36:44.479]  I mean, you know, they've got my wife's phone number, and they'll call her up all the time, and it's a woman's voice.
[03:36:44.540 --> 03:36:45.860]  Oh, hi, this is such-and-such.
[03:36:46.700 --> 03:36:47.899]  Is Alex there?
[03:36:48.639 --> 03:36:49.399]  No, he's not here.
[03:36:49.459 --> 03:36:49.719]  Who's this?
[03:36:49.819 --> 03:36:50.719]  Oh, just a friend.
[03:36:51.219 --> 03:36:51.959]  Well, who is this?
[03:36:52.239 --> 03:36:53.819]  Well, I mean, he's my fiancée.
[03:36:53.899 --> 03:36:54.340]  I'm pregnant.
[03:36:54.520 --> 03:36:55.120]  You know, just stuff.
[03:36:55.889 --> 03:36:58.389]  And they did that to my ex-wife too, and she bought into it.
[03:36:58.510 --> 03:37:00.190]  I mean, it's...
[03:37:00.190 --> 03:37:06.010]  They had AI call me one afternoon with Tucker Carlson's number spoof.
[03:37:06.090 --> 03:37:06.870]  So I said, Tucker Carlson.
[03:37:07.309 --> 03:37:10.649]  And I answer it, and it sounds just like Tucker Carlson.
[03:37:10.950 --> 03:37:15.149]  But then when he started saying he wanted to have sex with me and stuff, I figured out...
[03:37:16.100 --> 03:37:17.280]  That it wasn't Tucker.
[03:37:17.440 --> 03:37:23.440]  And then I realized, oh my God, in the last four or five days I was getting texts of Tucker saying, why'd you do this?
[03:37:23.500 --> 03:37:24.100]  Why'd you do that?
[03:37:24.139 --> 03:37:25.180]  I never called him.
[03:37:25.700 --> 03:37:27.120]  I just sent texts back on Tucker.
[03:37:27.239 --> 03:37:27.700]  That's not true.
[03:37:27.799 --> 03:37:28.159]  That's not true.
[03:37:28.219 --> 03:37:29.079]  So I actually called him.
[03:37:29.239 --> 03:37:30.159]  He called me back.
[03:37:30.299 --> 03:37:33.510]  I said, I just got hit with AI. I know you saw those texts.
[03:37:33.610 --> 03:37:34.389]  He goes, yeah, I didn't know what to think.
[03:37:34.569 --> 03:37:35.370]  I didn't respond.
[03:37:35.469 --> 03:37:36.909]  I didn't know what was happening.
[03:37:37.209 --> 03:37:44.090]  And then the comedian group out of Canada came out and said, yeah, I just recorded Alex Jones with fake stuff.
[03:37:44.190 --> 03:37:45.870]  I spoofed Tucker's number and did all this.
[03:37:46.170 --> 03:37:48.190]  Tucker had lawyers get on him, so they never released the tape.
[03:37:49.790 --> 03:37:58.299]  But, I mean, that's just a microcosm of the type of crap That goes on.
[03:37:59.059 --> 03:38:04.159]  And they had operatives in here, three of them, that we caught in the last seven years.
[03:38:05.639 --> 03:38:18.799]  And this one operative went around the office six years ago and said that on the surveillance cameras, I grabbed a female employee and drug her in an office and raped her.
[03:38:19.690 --> 03:38:22.989]  And then people came and asked the person, they said, that's insane.
[03:38:23.190 --> 03:38:26.629]  They came to me, and I was like, you think I'd do that?
[03:38:27.290 --> 03:38:27.729]  Okay?
[03:38:29.870 --> 03:38:47.010]  This same person went and told the head graphics guy, who's now been here like 12 years, he'd been here like five or six then, told him, Robert, that because he's Hispanic, I hate him and talk bad about him and hate his wife and Love the guy.
[03:38:47.629 --> 03:38:48.469]  He's a sweetheart.
[03:38:49.229 --> 03:38:49.670]  Badass.
[03:38:49.989 --> 03:38:52.850]  And I'd see him sometimes and he'd start crying.
[03:38:53.750 --> 03:38:55.190]  That's who these people are.
[03:38:55.270 --> 03:38:56.350]  There's hundreds of other stories.
[03:38:57.030 --> 03:38:58.450]  From my mind, I just move on.
[03:38:59.649 --> 03:39:02.149]  These people are demons, folks.
[03:39:02.370 --> 03:39:04.809]  And they do the same crap to Trump way worse.
[03:39:05.930 --> 03:39:09.110]  And I know I've also found out they do letter campaigns around the country.
[03:39:09.190 --> 03:39:10.469]  They do it to Trump too, but much worse.
[03:39:10.909 --> 03:39:13.989]  They do it in Canada and the UK where they send letters from me.
[03:39:14.960 --> 03:39:17.180]  Saying horrible things to prominent people and threats.
[03:39:17.379 --> 03:39:19.959]  And they call people in my voice and spoof me.
[03:39:20.600 --> 03:39:21.620]  These have been uploaded to YouTube.
[03:39:21.719 --> 03:39:22.260]  A lot of people have seen them.
[03:39:22.680 --> 03:39:24.579]  Even before they had AI, they would use soundboards.
[03:39:25.459 --> 03:39:29.579]  And I had one guy show up at the office like 10 years ago saying, I'm going to kill you here in Austin.
[03:39:30.079 --> 03:39:36.120]  Because they were calling a bunch of people and threatening them and attacking them and saying it was me and then telling them my address.
[03:39:36.440 --> 03:39:37.540]  Oh yeah, you're not going to do anything?
[03:39:37.700 --> 03:39:38.420]  Here's my address.
[03:39:38.879 --> 03:39:41.360]  And we had a guy show up here with a gun to kill me.
[03:39:42.559 --> 03:39:43.500]  Like 10 years ago.
[03:39:44.500 --> 03:39:50.399]  And he was so pissed that I was smiling like an old hillbilly guy that finally, the police got involved.
[03:39:50.500 --> 03:39:52.079]  They finally convinced him and said no.
[03:39:52.219 --> 03:39:54.959]  Because the police were getting threats from me.
[03:39:55.520 --> 03:39:57.139]  And they were getting fax machines.
[03:39:57.139 --> 03:39:59.579]  I'm going to kill you with the phone number.
[03:39:59.680 --> 03:40:01.319]  I'm coming to kill the police department.
[03:40:01.659 --> 03:40:05.360]  And, of course, it wasn't me saying I'm going to kill the police department.
[03:40:05.979 --> 03:40:09.680]  So, I mean, it just, it's, it's, that's nothing.
[03:40:10.579 --> 03:40:11.059]  Okay?
[03:40:11.479 --> 03:40:15.420]  That is absolutely not even one-tenth of it.
[03:40:16.659 --> 03:40:19.219]  They did it to my family previously.
[03:40:19.559 --> 03:40:22.120]  They haven't been able to manipulate my current wife.
[03:40:22.340 --> 03:40:27.219]  But they did this, and they did this, and they did this, and they did this, and they did this.
[03:40:27.700 --> 03:40:28.780]  You know, they would...
[03:40:31.170 --> 03:40:37.469]  Call her up, send people over, have newspapers come over and say, you know, Alex Jones is going to marry Leanne McAdoo.
[03:40:37.829 --> 03:40:39.510]  Never kissed her, never had sex with her.
[03:40:39.610 --> 03:40:40.750]  Great reporter, good friend of mine.
[03:40:41.309 --> 03:40:42.229]  Told her that.
[03:40:42.370 --> 03:40:43.270]  That got me divorced.
[03:40:43.829 --> 03:40:45.790]  You know, I mean, I should tell all these stories.
[03:40:45.889 --> 03:40:46.670]  Leanne knows all about it.
[03:40:46.729 --> 03:40:47.129]  She can tell you.
[03:40:47.709 --> 03:40:50.270]  And they harassed her so bad she finally, you know, couldn't handle it.
[03:40:50.489 --> 03:40:50.709]  Quit.
[03:40:51.329 --> 03:40:51.950]  Great lady.
[03:40:52.149 --> 03:40:52.850]  Really sweetheart.
[03:40:52.969 --> 03:40:53.409]  So smart.
[03:40:53.649 --> 03:40:54.270]  Good friend of mine.
[03:40:55.489 --> 03:40:58.329]  And, you know, I mean...
[03:40:59.610 --> 03:41:00.729]  I'm done talking about it.
[03:41:00.809 --> 03:41:01.409]  Owen's coming up.
[03:41:01.590 --> 03:41:04.850]  It's just, this is what these demons do.
[03:41:04.989 --> 03:41:08.750]  And imagine with their psychological warfare, what they do to kids.
[03:41:10.920 --> 03:41:12.379]  Imagine what they do in the colleges.
[03:41:12.420 --> 03:41:13.219]  You know what they do in colleges?
[03:41:14.139 --> 03:41:18.360]  The nerds show up, they're already profiled, and they get there and they go, there's an NGO. They go, oh God, come in here.
[03:41:18.459 --> 03:41:19.440]  There's white supremacists here today.
[03:41:19.780 --> 03:41:20.700]  We're going to protect you.
[03:41:21.020 --> 03:41:23.540]  And they bring them in and brainwash them and put them in basically the cult.
[03:41:24.139 --> 03:41:29.180]  Or PETA's there, and they go, oh, come in here and see some videos of animals being butchered, and they get them in a cult.
[03:41:29.739 --> 03:41:32.260]  It's all cult CIA programming.
[03:41:33.799 --> 03:41:36.379]  And so, you've got to be aware of it.
[03:41:36.420 --> 03:41:36.819]  I'm out of time.
[03:41:36.899 --> 03:41:39.260]  I'm sorry the other callers get their names and numbers.
[03:41:39.319 --> 03:41:40.159]  They want me to call them back tomorrow.
[03:41:40.299 --> 03:41:40.459]  I will.
[03:41:40.639 --> 03:41:41.780]  I'm doing a special broadcast tonight.
[03:41:41.840 --> 03:41:42.319]  I almost forgot.
[03:41:42.899 --> 03:41:46.659]  It'll be at 7 or 8.
[03:41:47.239 --> 03:41:54.739]  Let's go for 8 o'clock p.m., two hours, only on at AJNLime on X. The Alex Jones Network.
[03:41:54.780 --> 03:41:56.979]  Got to have that backup tested, fired up, ready to go.
[03:41:57.700 --> 03:41:59.000]  Days were shut down next Wednesday.
[03:41:59.940 --> 03:42:03.299]  So, you'll see it at Real Alex Jones on X. And you'll see it.
[03:42:04.739 --> 03:42:06.420]  At AJN. Be sure and follow me there.
[03:42:07.040 --> 03:42:08.219]  All right, he's fired up.
[03:42:08.319 --> 03:42:09.020]  He's ready to go.
[03:42:09.139 --> 03:42:10.139]  He's a former political prisoner.
[03:42:10.260 --> 03:42:11.440]  See how nice the New World Order is?
[03:42:12.299 --> 03:42:14.520]  Owen Schroer coming up straight ahead.
[03:42:14.620 --> 03:42:16.440]  But despite all the attacks, we get it through.
[03:42:16.860 --> 03:42:17.659]  Praise God.
[03:42:17.799 --> 03:42:18.979]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:42:19.260 --> 03:42:20.540]  Owen Schroer coming up.
[03:42:21.079 --> 03:42:26.719]  What I'm about to break down can benefit you in multiple ways, three different ways.
[03:42:28.219 --> 03:42:32.780]  Number one, it will keep this transmission against the globalists that they absolutely hate.
[03:42:33.620 --> 03:42:43.399]  On the air and we'll keep a broadcast and news information system that is credited by the most evil people on earth as being one of the main thorns in their side.
[03:42:43.659 --> 03:42:49.540]  So you keep us out there fighting for you, fighting for ourselves, fighting for our future when you get this product.
[03:42:49.780 --> 03:42:51.760]  Now here's the other two big benefits.
[03:42:52.980 --> 03:43:04.500]  Everybody knows that CBD from the hemp plant is absolutely incredible, anti-inflammatory, great for mental clarity and focus, but also being relaxed at the same time.
[03:43:04.860 --> 03:43:08.239]  Just so good for your immune system, all your cells, your whole body.
[03:43:08.420 --> 03:43:09.680]  It is a gift from God.
[03:43:09.860 --> 03:43:11.299]  So everybody knows that.
[03:43:11.600 --> 03:43:13.420]  Hell, medical doctors are prescribing it everywhere.
[03:43:14.559 --> 03:43:18.100]  But then here's the other part, and this is the part you may not know.
[03:43:19.680 --> 03:43:30.879]  When you see the high-end 1,000-milligram CBDs out there, and they're retailing at 120 or 140 or 150 from your doctor, these are the discounted brands for $75.
[03:43:31.500 --> 03:43:33.940]  That's about the market rate.
[03:43:34.909 --> 03:43:37.409]  That's a good deal compared to 120 or 150.
[03:43:37.969 --> 03:43:41.290]  But, ladies and gentlemen, there's a ton of markup in there.
[03:43:41.610 --> 03:43:50.809]  One of the top manufacturers in the country that has scores of companies private labeling their highly rated product is owned by a listener.
[03:43:51.350 --> 03:44:01.969]  And so I've been talking to them really for over a year, but in the last six months we got serious with one of my sponsors for them to go and private label them from them and for us to be authorized.
[03:44:02.930 --> 03:44:14.129]  To bring you the lowest price you're going to find anywhere on high-quality CBD. So I want to introduce to you JonesCBD.com.
[03:44:15.569 --> 03:44:16.930]  JonesCBD.com.
[03:44:17.129 --> 03:44:30.530]  Ladies and gentlemen, this 1,000-milligram concentrated nanotincture, which means it's way more highly absorbable, Could easily retail for $120 and sell all day.
[03:44:30.649 --> 03:44:32.250]  And some people will pay more if they think it's better.
[03:44:32.450 --> 03:44:32.809]  No.
[03:44:33.170 --> 03:44:40.649]  This same CBD is sold by different people that probably label it from $140, $120, $75.
[03:44:41.409 --> 03:44:44.370]  Nobody, even when they discount it, is going below that.
[03:44:44.940 --> 03:44:47.379]  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing Ultra Green.
[03:44:47.760 --> 03:44:54.719]  This is a thousand milligram, high-end, nano-process, so it goes into the cells.
[03:44:54.959 --> 03:44:56.600]  Much better at the statistics here.
[03:44:56.600 --> 03:44:57.340]  It's on the website.
[03:44:57.600 --> 03:45:00.180]  And this is all documented, all certified.
[03:45:00.799 --> 03:45:07.040]  This is the best steel you're going to find anywhere, and it's only $47.95.
[03:45:07.280 --> 03:45:10.540]  And when you combo it, It's even less.
[03:45:10.680 --> 03:45:13.040]  So let me read some of the facts off here.
[03:45:13.600 --> 03:45:20.239]  It's nano-sized bioavailability, supercharged, delivering eight to nine times the absorption of standard formulas.
[03:45:20.559 --> 03:45:25.940]  If you're done with watered-down, underpowered products, UltraGreen is here to bring you the real deal.
[03:45:26.459 --> 03:45:27.379]  Demand the best.
[03:45:27.600 --> 03:45:32.459]  Grab Ultra Green Nano CBD at jonescbd.com today.
[03:45:32.780 --> 03:45:36.940]  And then there's another great product that's even less, $39.95.
[03:45:36.940 --> 03:45:44.440]  And it's got the Nano CBD in it and then a whole bunch of other known concentrated herbs that give you deep, restful sleep.
[03:45:44.440 --> 03:45:47.860]  And the CBD does that as well.
[03:45:48.260 --> 03:45:51.219]  So I'm up to sell you on CBD. I'm up to sell you on supporting the broadcast.
[03:45:51.620 --> 03:45:56.319]  All I'm asking you to do is to try this And what do you have to lose?
[03:45:56.440 --> 03:45:57.479]  You've funded the broadcast.
[03:45:57.659 --> 03:45:58.239]  You're fighting tyranny.
[03:45:58.379 --> 03:46:09.879]  And when you get a great response from this CBD and you take it and it works better than CBD that costs twice as much or more, you're going to say, Alex Jones did not steer me wrong again.
[03:46:10.159 --> 03:46:14.840]  I didn't bring a silver or gold sponsor on until about 13 months ago.
[03:46:15.139 --> 03:46:17.059]  I've been in silver and gold for 30 years.
[03:46:17.299 --> 03:46:21.059]  For 12, I haven't promoted it because the silver and gold market was down.
[03:46:22.509 --> 03:46:24.290]  And most of the dealers were overcharging.
[03:46:24.430 --> 03:46:26.489]  So I didn't promote silver or gold for 12 years.
[03:46:26.889 --> 03:46:41.120]  When I knew it was going to explode, and I was sure of it, with all the indicators, because I read the economists' work across the board every day, I got a sponsor that's highly rated on, and silver, since he came on, is up almost 50%.
[03:46:41.120 --> 03:46:42.559]  Gold's exploded as well.
[03:46:42.760 --> 03:46:45.540]  So, I don't steer you wrong.
[03:46:45.959 --> 03:46:55.780]  And when I tell you that if you already like CBD, and most folks do and know how great it works, this is high-end, high-quality, at the lowest price you're going to find.
[03:46:55.860 --> 03:46:59.520]  This is just some of the products that are at jonescbd.com.
[03:46:59.719 --> 03:47:15.430]  We are very excited about this, and it is helping fund The Alex Jones Network at AJN Live on X and the studios, the satellite uplinks for radio and TV, the crew, the legal, everything we're doing.
[03:47:15.649 --> 03:47:16.989]  So it is a match made in heaven.
[03:47:17.909 --> 03:47:30.409]  All you've got to do is go to jonescbd.com, buy the product, you support the broadcast, you win right there, you get it, and you take it, and you get a great experience.
[03:47:30.409 --> 03:47:31.430]  It works great.
[03:47:31.629 --> 03:47:32.950]  Believe me, I use it all the time.
[03:47:33.129 --> 03:47:34.290]  My family uses it.
[03:47:35.129 --> 03:47:35.610]  And...
[03:47:36.569 --> 03:47:37.690]  Then I want you to do something else.
[03:47:37.829 --> 03:47:40.590]  If you've not known how good CBD was, you're going to go, this is great.
[03:47:40.690 --> 03:47:41.530]  You're into CBD now.
[03:47:42.879 --> 03:47:50.260]  Go out and get one of the other brands that's even more money and then just see if this doesn't work better or just as good because this is high-end.
[03:47:50.819 --> 03:47:56.379]  The same company we're getting this from, people sell it for twice as much or more all day long.
[03:47:56.659 --> 03:48:01.340]  Now again, if you are a CBD person, you'll know immediately when you take it that is high quality.
[03:48:01.559 --> 03:48:05.719]  Now, can you pay three times as much and get 3,000 milligram and even more concentrate?
[03:48:06.040 --> 03:48:07.940]  Yeah, but it becomes overkill.
[03:48:08.079 --> 03:48:11.930]  So instead of taking, you know, Four or five drops of the super strong stuff.
[03:48:12.090 --> 03:48:15.510]  You take six, seven, eight drops of this, and it's just as good.
[03:48:15.590 --> 03:48:16.270]  You got a lower price.
[03:48:16.649 --> 03:48:19.909]  And again, 1,000 milligram is very high on the spectrum.
[03:48:19.909 --> 03:48:20.829]  It's already very strong.
[03:48:20.850 --> 03:48:23.309]  But to be honest, there's stuff even stronger out there.
[03:48:23.370 --> 03:48:24.149]  But this is high quality.
[03:48:24.409 --> 03:48:25.110]  It's nano.
[03:48:25.389 --> 03:48:26.569]  It funds the operation.
[03:48:26.889 --> 03:48:31.469]  This is, hands down, the best deal there is out there.
[03:48:31.930 --> 03:48:38.049]  So please visit jonescbd.com today and keep this transmission on one way or another.
[03:48:38.229 --> 03:48:39.629]  I humbly thank you.
[03:48:39.750 --> 03:48:48.389]  I respectfully thank you for what you've done because I can't do this without you and we are funding our operations against the globalists of retail sales.
[03:48:49.059 --> 03:48:56.239]  And as you know, it's been all over the newspapers, have spent close to $80 million of lawsuits and garbage trying to shut us down the last seven years.
[03:48:56.459 --> 03:49:00.600]  And because of your support, we have been able to fight them off and stay on air.
[03:49:00.700 --> 03:49:07.459]  But now is our most critical time to ensure that this new system is able to stay on air, regardless of what happens to Infowars.
[03:49:07.600 --> 03:49:09.420]  So this is a time for action.
[03:49:09.840 --> 03:49:11.340]  And you don't just vote for Trump.
[03:49:12.010 --> 03:49:16.370]  You also support the independent organizations that are exposing the globalists.
[03:49:16.469 --> 03:49:21.729]  That's why they're obsessed with censorship, because with the truth getting out there, their lies cannot stand.
[03:49:21.950 --> 03:49:31.209]  So get a great deal, empower your body, reduce inflammation, have a better immune system, enjoy all the great benefits of CBD and more.
[03:49:31.549 --> 03:49:36.190]  Get a great deal and keep us on air all at jonescbd.com.
