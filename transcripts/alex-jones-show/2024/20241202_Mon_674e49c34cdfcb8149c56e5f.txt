[00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.710]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and support the Infowars.
[00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:28.609]  It's Monday, December 2nd, 2024. And the deep state is in total panic mode as Trump begins to deliver on his promises.
[00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.949]  InfoWars.
[00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:32.649]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:47.679]  48 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes, 16 seconds, until President Trump is inaugurated.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:01:02.020]  As the 47th President of the United States of America, it is Monday, December 2nd, 2024. I am your embattled.
[00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.870]  Battle-hardened.
[00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:14.170]  Host, after 30-plus years in the trenches, we see globally the tide has completely turned.
[00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:22.750]  The New World Order transhumanist death cult is on its heels, and humanity is rising.
[00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.689]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I am loaded for bear.
[00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.159]  I am ready to go for the next four hours of this Monday transmission.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:48.180]  Now let's put up on screen the live show Feeds from X so everybody can see the headline and so everybody can share it if you want to continue to win against the tyrants.
[00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:51.090]  Massive bombshell developments.
[00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.730]  Trump pledges to prosecute Biden administration UN NGOs for human trafficking and sex slavery.
[00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.290]  Deep State now in total panic.
[00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.930]  Must watch share live feed of this transmission.
[00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.710]  100% Trump's for real.
[00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.870]  100% it's going down.
[00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.689]  When you've studied history, there are these moments, these great turnings.
[00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.150]  And it looks like evil is invincible.
[00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.270]  It's dancing on humanity's grave.
[00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.669]  It's committing mass crimes out in the open.
[00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.050]  The arrogance.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.539]  Close.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:49.240]  The self-satisfied smirks gleam until it all starts disintegrating like vampires in the midday sun.
[00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:54.360]  And we are now at that beginning of the climax.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:12.699]  And it is a very dangerous moment as well because the future projection Of humanity's destiny in the next thousand years is now laying out before us.
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.960]  What a time to be alive, my friends.
[00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:37.460]  And obviously, we're not offering some utopia on the other side of this, but a system at least driven by the will of the people To survive and prosper and have some semblance of justice,
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.639]  prosperity, basic freedom.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.860]  The other choice is total despotism.
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.460]  So here's what's coming up today.
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.520]  Oh, we're gonna revisit with the new developments what we covered last night.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:16.100]  Oh, all the big new administration officials are announcing that indeed they're going to be prosecuting not just the low-level human smugglers, but the NGOs, the non-profits, the for-profits, and the Biden administration officials like Alejandro Mayorkas and others.
[00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:36.730]  But in response, they're all scrambling around asking for blanket, total, open-ended pardons like Hunter Biden just got.
[00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:39.589]  Oh, there's so much to cover today.
[00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:42.930]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:43.810]  Stay with us.
[00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:50.689]  Thank you for joining us on this live teleprompter-free populist rebellion against tyranny.
[00:04:50.870 --> 00:05:02.269]  It's Monday, December 2nd, 2024. We are 48 very long, very dangerous days away from President Trump being inaugurated on the south side of the U.S. Capitol in Mordor.
[00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:13.060]  Alright, Trump is 100% delivering on what he said he would do.
[00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:31.939]  It's obviously not perfect, because only God's perfect, and there's quite a few things I don't like that Trump pushes, but overall he's not out to get us, and he cares about the country and justice and freedom, and he is doing the things he said he would do,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.370]  and the system is Is beyond apoplectic.
[00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:38.750]  They are beyond chickens with their heads cut off running around.
[00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.149]  And they are as dangerous as hell.
[00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:53.829]  That said, they're badly coordinated, turning on each other, and are absolutely falling all over themselves.
[00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:57.970]  And this is spectacular.
[00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.980]  Now, Yesterday, I got particularly prepared for the show.
[00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:07.399]  I mean, I probably prepared six, seven hours yesterday.
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:25.839]  And then I did an hour on the biggest news, and then I just, I hit a wall, and this doesn't happen very often, where I've done so much preparation, and it would take probably five hours to cover it all, that I just, every once in a while, I just go,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.100]  like Robbie the robot when he has too much information, cannot compute, cannot compute, smoke coming out of my ears.
[00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:33.910]  But I'm refocused, prepared.
[00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.149]  I don't just have all the other news I didn't get to yesterday that I prepared for.
[00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:43.170]  I prepared a lot for all this other stuff, so I've cleared the deck of guests.
[00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:52.389]  I may take calls, but it won't be to the third or fourth hour because I need to cover all of this.
[00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:59.350]  And again, the problem is each article I can do an hour on easily.
[00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:03.779]  Because it's full depth understanding of something that really gives us victory.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.439]  I mean, like this story I've had since Friday that I meant to cover.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.579]  And it didn't cover Friday, didn't cover Saturday, didn't cover Sunday.
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.060]  It's so spectacular.
[00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:19.519]  The U.S. government came out and admitted basically to all their weather control.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.720]  And said, but we're creating a new weather control bureau like a bunch of other countries have.
[00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:36.750]  To stop other countries from attacking us with it and keeping other people from being able to do it individually or through a business, a corporation.
[00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.129]  And I mean, you talk about a deep dive.
[00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:47.610]  I mean, this is beyond geoengineering, beyond terraforming, beyond just what's going on there and how massive that is.
[00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:51.290]  The fact that they're coming out with it, why is that?
[00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:52.470]  And then...
[00:07:54.019 --> 00:08:01.439]  This story feeds into everything else on how the globalists operate and how their control is coming to an end.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.379]  I mean, that story alone gives me a headache.
[00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:05.319]  It's so important.
[00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:07.860]  And by headache, I mean my head just...
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:13.240]  Yesterday, I spent about an hour just reading that and printing documents and thinking about it.
[00:08:13.399 --> 00:08:16.860]  And I wrote more than 30 notes just about it.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.839]  And each note would take five minutes.
[00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:22.569]  So that's where I'm at.
[00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.610]  That's one stack.
[00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:39.610]  There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 stacks.
[00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.110]  Some stacks are more than 20 articles.
[00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.289]  I've got 50-something videos here.
[00:08:46.029 --> 00:08:47.690]  You're like, well, then get to it, Jack.
[00:08:47.889 --> 00:08:49.750]  Okay, I'm going to.
[00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:55.490]  But each one of these stacks brings up a whole database in my head, and I'm just like, ah!
[00:08:58.779 --> 00:09:03.700]  Because one thing to sit in my office, because the brain moves so quick, it's then, how do you boil it down?
[00:09:03.799 --> 00:09:04.919]  How do you put in a spoken word?
[00:09:05.139 --> 00:09:11.340]  It's each one of these stacks is like a whole speech that a professor or politician would spend weeks getting ready for.
[00:09:11.419 --> 00:09:11.840]  See what I mean?
[00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:14.200]  So it's painful.
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.019]  Like Musk says, the brain is hurting, but it's good.
[00:09:18.299 --> 00:09:19.200]  It's good for you.
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:26.100]  Like all that exercising I did for an hour and a half this morning, it got a little painful, but it feels good now.
[00:09:28.439 --> 00:09:32.720]  So, that said, I had a little temper tantrum about an hour and a half of the show.
[00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:34.220]  I apologize to the crew and everybody else for that.
[00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:35.120]  That's not fake.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:35.620]  It's real.
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.080]  And that's Robbie the Robot having fire shooting out of my ears.
[00:09:40.059 --> 00:09:43.899]  And I get why a lot of people don't want to know about reality because it's complex and it's wild.
[00:09:43.899 --> 00:09:46.879]  And the deeper you get into it, the more deep it gets and the more you want to know.
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.139]  And, woo, it's wild!
[00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:51.470]  And it's fulfilling.
[00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:57.950]  But it's like sometimes, it's like driving in a race car, 250 miles an hour, it's like, when do I get off this thing?
[00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:04.889]  So, let me, let me just do this.
[00:10:05.029 --> 00:10:07.029]  I think the only way to do this is just start per stack.
[00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:09.629]  It's like you're about to start a marathon.
[00:10:09.629 --> 00:10:11.169]  It's like, ah, ooh, ooh.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.820]  It's like, I hate to use a bad analogy, but I am a dirty devil at points.
[00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:22.419]  It'd be like 20 of the most beautiful women you've ever seen in your life.
[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.759]  You got one day to be cool.
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.860]  I'm sorry, sorry, I'm being bad.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.559]  The point is, because each one of these is devastating to the New World Order.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.019]  And I really want to hit the nail on the head with all these.
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.100]  So...
[00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:51.289]  I mean, this right here is a big deal.
[00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:53.629]  I should probably do the whole show on this.
[00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:55.110]  You know what this is?
[00:10:55.929 --> 00:10:59.929]  This is what I told you months and months and months ago was coming because they said it was coming.
[00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.029]  And then no one else talked about it but them.
[00:11:02.769 --> 00:11:03.950]  It's the Marshall Law Plan.
[00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:06.649]  Kind of a big deal.
[00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:13.970]  And this is their fallback plan that they can't kill Trump or stop him from winning the election, which he did, thanks to you.
[00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:28.120]  They're going to stage uprisings and do big false flags, racial false flags, as their pretext for civil war.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.200]  Kind of a big deal.
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.000]  This is how they plan to stop the agenda right here.
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:39.039]  And if you're a regular listener, you've heard me talk about this probably 100 times or more in the last year.
[00:11:40.139 --> 00:11:42.860]  If you listen every day, probably 300 times.
[00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:45.000]  But this is big.
[00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:50.080]  And it ties into all the rest of this.
[00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:59.299]  Democrat senators urge Biden to try to limit Trump's ability to use the military domestically.
[00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:03.940]  NBC News.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:10.259]  Now, again, this article gives me a headache because it's got hundreds and really more than that data points.
[00:12:11.409 --> 00:12:27.929]  This is a legislative coup over the executive, and they think if Biden, outgoing, somehow certifies that the presidency no longer has the power over the military, the command of it, Congress has the funding, that it's legitimate.
[00:12:27.929 --> 00:12:28.950]  That's one level.
[00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.769]  But the bigger issue is, what are they planning?
[00:12:31.909 --> 00:12:34.169]  Well, they say there's going to be uprisings against Hitler.
[00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:37.769]  I mean, obviously, Hitler 2.0, Donald John Trump...
[00:12:39.079 --> 00:12:43.080]  And the Trump supporters are going to kill the migrants and kill the black people.
[00:12:44.539 --> 00:12:50.399]  They just say that with surety out of a clear blue sky because they're going to do the false flags.
[00:12:51.639 --> 00:12:52.120]  Duh!
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:13:00.440]  So I'm just sitting here waiting when Trump gets in and they're going to have white supremacists mow down a bunch of migrants.
[00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.809]  To set up Tom Homan and Trump and all of us, this is a big deal.
[00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.450]  And all of this is a big deal.
[00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:11.490]  Yeah, like the U.S. government's going to create a weather control bureau.
[00:13:11.769 --> 00:13:13.570]  Oh, like they just now started it.
[00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:14.450]  That's kind of big.
[00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:15.870]  That's two stories.
[00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:19.450]  Oh, my God.
[00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.210]  So, I mean, then you got this.
[00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.490]  Oh, this is not just a big deal.
[00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:28.529]  This is ginormous.
[00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:32.200]  And it's exactly what Dr. Kirk Elliott keeps saying.
[00:13:32.679 --> 00:13:33.580]  Great economist.
[00:13:33.899 --> 00:13:34.600]  Really smart guy.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.460]  Everybody that's lovey-dovey with Putin just because he's been anti-globalist.
[00:13:41.539 --> 00:13:45.059]  Everybody that thinks we're going to have a bunch of sweetie kissy time with the Russians.
[00:13:46.229 --> 00:13:47.190]  That's not happening.
[00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.470]  Trump never worked with the Russians.
[00:13:48.649 --> 00:13:50.049]  Trump isn't on the payroll of the Russians.
[00:13:50.950 --> 00:14:03.289]  Trump is 100% a nationalist pro-America, and he is going to destroy the BRICS. And with him at the helm, he will win.
[00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.250]  He's not going to blow the Russians up.
[00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.389]  With bombs, that's a stupid way to do it.
[00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:14.850]  He is going to keep the dollar as the global power.
[00:14:15.129 --> 00:14:17.210]  You're like, well, wait, that's how the globalists control things.
[00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:17.909]  Yeah.
[00:14:18.169 --> 00:14:22.809]  And if you think Trump's going to give up that power, he's going to take it away from the globalists.
[00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:27.149]  And then he's going to turn us into a giant economic war machine.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:35.700]  So, Trump warns BRICS nations they will face 100% tariffs if they abandon the U.S. dollar.
[00:14:35.899 --> 00:14:40.159]  The globalists were manipulating America into the new global currency.
[00:14:40.299 --> 00:14:46.440]  To have the new global currency, you've got to have the dollar massively diminished.
[00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:54.399]  And then they were going to have this new global system, but then the Russians and the Chinese double-crossed the globalists and were setting up their system.
[00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.110]  You see?
[00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:01.909]  So Trump goes, nope, we'll just take the dollar back over and we're not going to have it go away.
[00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.350]  And bye-bye to the New World Order.
[00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.250]  Bye-bye to the Russian New World Order.
[00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:06.730]  Bye-bye to the Chinese New World Order.
[00:15:06.909 --> 00:15:08.450]  Bye-bye to India's New World Order.
[00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:10.309]  Bye-bye to the EU's New World Order.
[00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:13.970]  Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye.
[00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.470]  This is what America first looks like.
[00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:19.669]  Okay, so there's that stack.
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:29.000]  You've obviously got the Hunter Biden unilateral.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.360]  What's the term they officially use with the BBC headline backup?
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.700]  And I've got it here in the pardon, but what's the word?
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:35.519]  Unconditional.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.100]  360 total.
[00:15:38.379 --> 00:15:44.919]  Any crimes he committed since 2014 forward.
[00:15:46.419 --> 00:15:47.799]  You ever heard of a pardon like that?
[00:15:48.899 --> 00:15:50.080]  An omnibus.
[00:15:52.789 --> 00:15:53.389]  Unconditional.
[00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:54.029]  That's the word.
[00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.850]  Biden gives son, Hunter, unconditional pardon.
[00:15:59.009 --> 00:16:03.950]  That's called a get-out-of-jail-free card.
[00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:07.690]  Spectacular.
[00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:11.169]  Now, what goes back to 2014?
[00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.330]  Well, Hunter wasn't really running anything big or important.
[00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:18.870]  He was doing some bag man operations before that, but...
[00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:27.509]  Biden was big vice president then and all the rest of it, so there was big money to get on the Chinese communist hind tit.
[00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:36.090]  And there's the bioweapons labs in Ukraine and the energy scams and Biden bragging about it.
[00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:43.169]  Yeah, that's what this is all about, is protecting that entire criminal network that he was the bag man the whole time for.
[00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.429]  So this was a well-thought-out scam before Biden's brain completely rotted.
[00:16:48.819 --> 00:16:50.580]  So, that's what this is really all about.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:17:01.240]  Of course, there's more than one way to skin a rabbit, or a cat, or a pedophile, politically, non-violently, constitutionally.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:06.900]  And that's the states coming after him, which, if it's good for the goose, it's good for the gander.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.880]  And so, I don't think old Hunter, the smartest man he knows, is going to get away with this.
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:14.940]  But...
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:24.079]  This is a lot bigger than a gun charge and IRS stuff and crack and crack whores and all the rest of these degenerates are up to.
[00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:26.319]  So we've got that stack.
[00:17:27.779 --> 00:17:32.119]  So what I've just mentioned, three stacks out of 36. Well, you get the idea.
[00:17:33.579 --> 00:17:40.380]  You got the Australian government coming after America's free speech, demonizing Joe Rogan.
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.480]  There's a lot to unpack there.
[00:17:45.099 --> 00:17:47.779]  And don't ever interrupt your enemies when they're destroying themselves.
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.480]  And we've got a lot here.
[00:17:51.619 --> 00:17:57.140]  We've got Kara Starmer admitting that replacement migration is a real plan and all done by design, close quote.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.160]  You've got liberal women getting sterilized after Donald Trump's victory.
[00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.630]  Talk about taking yourself out of the game.
[00:18:04.569 --> 00:18:12.329]  You've got all sorts of just insane news with the rats leaving the sinking ship.
[00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:18.150]  You've got big developments militarily in Ukraine, in Georgia, in Syria.
[00:18:20.049 --> 00:18:23.990]  They've got new plandemic plans they're rolling out.
[00:18:24.109 --> 00:18:47.210]  World leaders sign new censorship declaration at the UN event while Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez pushes for increased online censorship and a global internet ID. And you've got Australia passing an internet ID law under the guise of protecting kids from porn.
[00:18:47.430 --> 00:19:02.549]  As much as I like Ken Paxton, Republicans here in the United States, and the same thing is going on in Europe with conservative parties there, are, oh, in the name of protecting children from porn,
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.660]  Setting up internet IDs.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.059]  And that's where this goes.
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:15.839]  And so, Texas is in the next to last step like Australia just did.
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.220]  It's one thing to tell companies, hey, you gotta have age verification yourself.
[00:19:21.839 --> 00:19:22.819]  But then when you...
[00:19:22.819 --> 00:19:25.440]  And now the left's saying, well, that's not fair to federal courts.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.880]  We don't just want Pornhub, the biggest porn site, to have to do this.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.859]  It's not fair.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.240]  Only seven companies by Texas law.
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:34.960]  No, we want everyone.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.619]  And the federal courts are getting ready to rule.
[00:19:36.779 --> 00:19:37.619]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:41.599]  Texas can't have unjust weights and measures.
[00:19:42.079 --> 00:19:44.359]  You can't just make seven porn sites.
[00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.349]  That are responsible, they say, for 90% of the porn.
[00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.609]  You can't just have age verification there.
[00:19:50.730 --> 00:20:05.170]  It's got to be if you want to go online to H-E-B grocery stores or Piggly Wiggly or Walmart and buy some beans and filet mignons or whatever.
[00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.789]  You got to do that too.
[00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:18.089]  Oh, it's a Trojan horse for Internet ID, and the Internet ID is the global digital ID that'll control everything.
[00:20:18.089 --> 00:20:23.589]  The social credit score, the mark of the beast, the enemy's main takeover plan.
[00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:26.309]  You think they're on our ass now, sweetheart?
[00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.309]  No.
[00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:31.089]  Parents, put the portal controls on the computers.
[00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.410]  Keep your kids off the computers.
[00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:34.349]  Protect them.
[00:20:35.849 --> 00:20:40.230]  It's not the government's job to control what you can do on the Internet.
[00:20:43.279 --> 00:20:45.900]  I mean, I don't have to, do I have to really explain this to people?
[00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:47.319]  I mean, come on.
[00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:50.180]  I mean, it's admitted that's the plan.
[00:20:51.259 --> 00:20:54.420]  Bill Gates and the rest of them in the UN are pushing this crap.
[00:20:54.619 --> 00:20:57.099]  And I've got the articles, I'll show you everything I just said.
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.799]  Oh, Democrats file lawsuits.
[00:21:00.039 --> 00:21:00.880]  Oh, Texas, no.
[00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:01.720]  You know what?
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.980]  We agree with this internet ID. But Ken Paxton's wrong.
[00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:07.200]  We want it for everybody.
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.960]  You want to go shop and buy some new tires like I was doing this morning?
[00:21:13.299 --> 00:21:16.940]  Been about 30 minutes poking around trying to find the best cheap tires for my car.
[00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:19.400]  All tires on the front.
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:23.619]  Oh, sorry, Internet ID. It's not here yet, but it will be soon.
[00:21:27.059 --> 00:21:29.240]  You think they've been debanking us so far?
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.319]  Yeah, debanking Trump's whole family, debanking me over and over again?
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.559]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:21:35.859 --> 00:21:40.319]  All right, that is a small snapshot of what is coming up today.
[00:21:40.319 --> 00:21:41.680]  Now let me get into...
[00:21:44.309 --> 00:21:47.190]  The big, massive news.
[00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.849]  And there's been new developments since last night.
[00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:52.450]  You got Tom Holman, the new Borders are.
[00:21:52.589 --> 00:21:54.529]  You got Kash Patel, the new FBI director.
[00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.630]  And he doesn't have to face Senate approval.
[00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:01.930]  They just got to fire or make the old FBI director resign.
[00:22:05.529 --> 00:22:07.130]  And you've got...
[00:22:11.569 --> 00:22:14.349]  Exactly what we called for, exactly what I was told was going on.
[00:22:17.609 --> 00:22:32.549]  The new borders are Tom Homan saying, I'll play the clip coming up, that they are going to criminally not just go after the NGOs, not just go after the human traffickers at the ground level, where the rubber meets the road, at the tire asphalt level.
[00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:52.309]  That's important, but they're going to go after the NGOs and the for-profits and the State Department and Alejandro I don't normally revel in things,
[00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:53.910]  but I really don't like these people.
[00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.809]  And I really want to save the children.
[00:22:56.589 --> 00:22:58.990]  You think your kids are safe while this is going on?
[00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.190]  You think they're going to stop with just the poor migrant kids?
[00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:03.930]  Let me tell you something.
[00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:05.309]  It's in the news.
[00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:08.210]  He's running around trying to get immunity right now.
[00:23:11.059 --> 00:23:13.440]  Ah, good luck, you piece of filth.
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.119]  You piece of fucking shit.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.359]  I'm gonna tell you, I don't drink anymore.
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:30.119]  But when that bastard gets sentenced to life in prison in a supermax prison, I'm gonna get some Dom Perignon.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.200]  I am.
[00:23:32.819 --> 00:23:35.180]  I'm not even swing from the chandelier at my house.
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:35.980]  I'm serious.
[00:23:36.779 --> 00:23:40.400]  I never swung from a chandelier, but I'm gonna get a stepladder, I'm gonna swing on it.
[00:23:42.259 --> 00:23:42.720]  I am.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.220]  I'm going to dance on the table.
[00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:47.900]  Nobody triggers me like him.
[00:23:50.339 --> 00:24:00.200]  My spirit goes, that's the bad guy, right?
[00:24:02.259 --> 00:24:03.420]  It's okay, just stop.
[00:24:04.759 --> 00:24:06.019]  Okay, I'm going to go to break.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.380]  I'm going to leave you a little compilation about the Hunter Biden pardon.
[00:24:10.579 --> 00:24:12.140]  That's the whole crime syndicate pardon right there.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.819]  Look at that face.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.660]  Look at that arrogance.
[00:24:19.539 --> 00:24:21.839]  Here's a little compilation of Nobody's Above the Law.
[00:24:32.319 --> 00:24:35.980]  Is the President of the United States Above the Law?
[00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:40.009]  No person is above the law.
[00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:41.490]  No one is above the law.
[00:24:41.529 --> 00:24:42.569]  No one is above the law.
[00:24:42.609 --> 00:24:46.410]  No one is above the law.
[00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:49.170]  He's certainly not above the law.
[00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:50.130]  Nobody's above the law.
[00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:51.269]  No one is above the law.
[00:24:51.329 --> 00:24:56.630]  No one is above the law, not even the President of the United States.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.720]  No one is above the law, not even the President of the United States.
[00:24:59.759 --> 00:25:01.759]  This President believes he is above the law.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.500]  And no one, not even the President, should be above the law.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.099]  No one is above the law.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.819]  It's certainly not the President.
[00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:09.720]  Oh my God!
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:13.500]  Again, I'll repeat, no one, not even the President, is above the law.
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.700]  Oh my god, do you know what this means?
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.039]  We finally got him!
[00:25:17.099 --> 00:25:19.319]  We have a president who believes he is above the law.
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.920]  No person is above the law.
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.180]  Nobody's above the law.
[00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:24.640]  We don't believe that anybody should be above the law.
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.380]  He is not, as some people have tried to suggest, above the law.
[00:25:27.519 --> 00:25:29.519]  The president is declaring himself above the law.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:34.259]  No one, not even the president of the United States, Is above the law.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.880]  Donald Trump has tried to put himself above the law.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.359]  And that's not how it works.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.140]  That's not how any of this works.
[00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:43.019]  You are above the law.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:48.920]  In my view, there is nothing more dangerous than an unethical president who believes they are above the law.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.460]  You guys think you're above the law?
[00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:52.250]  You ain't above mine.
[00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:56.269]  These are felony crimes in New York State, no matter who you are.
[00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:57.589]  No one is above the law.
[00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.210]  Nobody is above the law.
[00:25:59.369 --> 00:26:01.829]  We must ensure that no one is above the law.
[00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:06.829]  Dear God, this guy cannot in any way be allowed to be above the law.
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.839]  This is the United States of America.
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.599]  No one is above the law.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:12.880]  No one.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:13.680]  No one.
[00:26:13.759 --> 00:26:15.319]  No one is above the law.
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.140]  No one is above the law.
[00:26:17.359 --> 00:26:18.180]  Not Donald Trump.
[00:26:18.339 --> 00:26:18.839]  Not anybody.
[00:26:19.099 --> 00:26:21.079]  I tend to think that nobody is above the law.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.119]  No person above the law.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.200]  No one is above the law.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.980]  Looks like Donald Trump may have broken the law.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.039]  No one is above the law.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.400]  No one, not even the president, is above the law.
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:32.740]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[00:26:33.559 --> 00:26:34.039]  Adjourn.
[00:26:36.779 --> 00:26:38.920]  Biological attack is imminent!
[00:26:39.539 --> 00:26:40.119]  Imminent!
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.180]  It's going to happen.
[00:26:41.339 --> 00:26:44.900]  It's not a question of will it happen, but when it happens.
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:56.579]  A bioweapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to counter a global problem, and the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:03.079]  This is a biological warfare agent that had leaked out of the Wuhan laboratory.
[00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.210]  We've been through a lot at Infowars.
[00:27:10.369 --> 00:27:12.910]  America and the world has been through hell.
[00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:14.410]  But the Great Awakening is here.
[00:27:14.869 --> 00:27:16.450]  The globalists are in full panic mode.
[00:27:16.609 --> 00:27:29.150]  And now it's more important than ever to keep the most powerful, effective voices at exposing the globalist agenda and promoting the Team Humanity agenda on air.
[00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:38.150]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, is owned by great patriots and some of the top makers of Patriot apparel.

[00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.750]  We have two new campaign coins.
[00:28:08.869 --> 00:28:10.589]  Two different coins right here.
[00:28:10.809 --> 00:28:15.369]  One is the answer to 1984 is $17.76.
[00:28:16.289 --> 00:28:19.470]  And on one side, it's got the Gadsden flag.
[00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:22.589]  On the other side, it's got yours truly.
[00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:35.029]  The other great coin is 1776 limited edition coin with a Gadsden flag, don't tread on me, and 1776. Both are powerful coins, powerful coins.
[00:28:35.819 --> 00:28:50.900]  Messages, they weigh a lot, they feel good, they're a great gift, they're a great memento, they're a great keepsake, they're a great conversation starter, and both these coins are $14.97 at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.420]  We can't do this without you.
[00:28:52.539 --> 00:28:55.059]  We want to sell you products you love, so you come back again and again.
[00:28:55.299 --> 00:28:56.579]  Thanks for keeping us in the fight.
[00:28:56.779 --> 00:29:00.619]  Please visit thealexjonesstore.com today and get the campaign coins.
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:23.039]  Ladies and gentlemen, I come to you from the battle-scarred headquarters of Infowars, vaunted in our history, battling tyrants, and our epic success,
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:35.819]  sounding the alarm, lighting the watchtowers, to rally humanity in our darkest hour.
[00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:38.450]  We'll never be erased.
[00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:44.509]  And not just the world's been watching and listening, but God's been watching.
[00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:46.289]  Never forget that.
[00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:47.869]  God is on the throne.
[00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:52.390]  Alright, let's get into the big story.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:27.609]  The obvious move to do the right thing and save the children and not aid and abet the globalist in the biggest public human trafficking sex slavery operation in history and to bring down the globalist global network is to go into the NGOs in the last four years that have been in full command Of the DHS
[00:30:27.609 --> 00:30:29.769]  ICE Border Patrol systems.
[00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:46.769]  You go to the border, and it's in the documents, we've shot the video, literal communists with purple-green hair are ordering and commanding the National Guard and the Border Patrol around.
[00:30:50.809 --> 00:30:54.670]  And the Border Patrol came out and their heads of their unions said, we're completing a smuggling process.
[00:30:54.670 --> 00:31:05.250]  They said that a month in to Biden stealing the election in 2021. And they had tons of people resign and quit because they wouldn't be part of it.
[00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:08.230]  And whistleblowers and congressional testimony.
[00:31:10.109 --> 00:31:12.250]  And the corporate media tried to suppress it.
[00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:16.549]  And AOC would go and cry at the border to empty fields.
[00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:19.390]  And Trump's putting kids in cages before that.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:43.680]  And the obvious move is that if you study the UN and NATO for 30 years at least, it would be even the BBC and the London Telegraph and Le Figaro and Der Spiegel and Bild.
[00:31:45.359 --> 00:31:46.819]  Not in the last 10 years or so.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.680]  Corporate control was so great, it wasn't really in the news anymore.
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.480]  AP was the last big report I saw like five years ago about Haiti.
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:32:00.940]  Admitting, oh, the UN kidnapped and ran tens of thousands of children out of here and disappeared a bunch of them, and some have been found dead.
[00:32:01.779 --> 00:32:04.799]  And that AP multi-year report...
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.140]  Our reporters have been there as well.
[00:32:07.539 --> 00:32:09.180]  Got almost zero coverage.
[00:32:09.519 --> 00:32:17.680]  So, see, it's important before I just tell you what Homan and Kosh Patel and the rest of them are saying Trump's ordered them to do.
[00:32:17.859 --> 00:32:19.339]  Go after the NGOs.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.319]  Go after the UN. Go after the non-profits.
[00:32:22.559 --> 00:32:23.839]  Go after the poor profits.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:30.519]  And go after the administration officials that were in command of it.
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:35.000]  They do not have immunity.
[00:32:36.589 --> 00:32:44.750]  You have immunity when you're executing lawfully your office, not when you're executing it unfaithfully or criminally.
[00:32:46.630 --> 00:33:00.809]  So, literally, I have seen thousands of articles when I first got on air 30 years ago through about a decade ago.
[00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:02.450]  It used to.
[00:33:02.769 --> 00:33:13.710]  UN caught with five passenger planes chartered with kidnapped women and children being flown to sex slavery destinations.
[00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:24.730]  And Halliburton caught in nine countries with over 100,000 slave laborers from Asia.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.920]  They'd fly them to Africa, Middle East.
[00:33:30.059 --> 00:33:32.519]  I mean, you're reading this stuff, and they have photos of it.
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:39.259]  They'd have congressional testimony, and ask Halliburton, you know, and other companies about how they're running giant slave operations.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:40.099]  They go, well, it's legal.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:49.480]  Rumsfeld gets asked about it, and he goes, well, you know, DynCorp got caught running tens of thousands of kidnapped kids in Europe for the UN. And he goes, well, they did get put in a penalty box.
[00:33:49.539 --> 00:33:50.759]  They weren't given contracts for a year.
[00:33:51.819 --> 00:33:53.039]  You can pull that up on YouTube.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:53.819]  It's probably still there.
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:54.359]  They didn't take it down.
[00:33:54.619 --> 00:33:56.359]  We played it probably 200 times over the years.
[00:33:56.599 --> 00:34:04.819]  I haven't played it in years, but he's asked about it by Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney.
[00:34:06.039 --> 00:34:13.829]  She goes, well, the Dine Corps got caught kidnapping all these women and children, sex slavery, and He goes, they didn't get in trouble.
[00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:17.030]  And he goes, well, they got put in a penalty box for a year.
[00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.550]  He doesn't even deny it.
[00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:24.329]  Just type in Rumsfeld questioned on human trafficking in Congress.
[00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:26.329]  He doesn't even deny it.
[00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:30.070]  So my point is, this has been going on huge in Europe.
[00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:32.750]  Because they get the top dollar.
[00:34:33.789 --> 00:34:38.130]  And they would grab mainly out of Eastern and Central Europe.
[00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:41.820]  Kids down to like a year or two old, just out of the backs of yards.
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:48.039]  But their favorite thing would be like a 10 or 12-year-old girl with these fake modeling agencies.
[00:34:48.039 --> 00:34:51.900]  They'd come to town, set up a little modeling agency, good-looking women there.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.159]  Oh, you're going to be in a model.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.239]  We're going to take photos of you.
[00:34:54.579 --> 00:34:58.679]  We need you to go ahead and come and have a drink with us here in the back.
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:06.300]  They'd drug them, put them in a van, and take them to an airplane run by the UN, by DynCorp.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.880]  By you name it.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:10.840]  And...
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.500]  Never seen again.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.760]  And boy, the Arabs would pay a lot.
[00:35:16.039 --> 00:35:16.780]  They have.
[00:35:18.179 --> 00:35:21.460]  Still, in a bunch of Middle Eastern countries, what they call harems.
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.739]  Let's pull up the definition of a harem or a haram.
[00:35:28.099 --> 00:35:30.579]  And that's your building full of slave women.
[00:35:31.019 --> 00:35:32.119]  And they call...
[00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:37.429]  The girls below the age of 10 in Islam, virgins.
[00:35:37.889 --> 00:35:40.929]  You hear, oh, you get 57 virgins when you blow yourself up.
[00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:42.550]  That means little girls.
[00:35:43.909 --> 00:35:44.449]  Pedophilia.
[00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:48.289]  You know, Muhammad married a nine-year-old.
[00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:49.489]  It's in the Koran.
[00:35:51.409 --> 00:35:52.989]  So that's not blasphemy.
[00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.150]  It's your own history book.
[00:35:55.989 --> 00:36:01.650]  Mecca was the slave center out of Asia into the west of slaves from the east.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.579]  And Muslims traffic slaves all the way in the Pacific Ocean.
[00:36:06.579 --> 00:36:10.159]  That's why a bunch of countries in the Pacific Ocean, like Indonesia, are Muslim.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:22.519]  You know the song about, from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, we will fight our country's battles.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:38.599]  That's when President Thomas Jefferson sent the Leathernecks, the Marines on ships, Over the Mediterranean and other areas into the Arabian Sea.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:56.179]  Because the Muslims were hijacking all the different shipping of Europe and running raids again and kidnapping women out of Europe on their shores in Italy, in Greece, and in southern Spain.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:00.480]  So he sent a bunch of Marines over to kill their ass.
[00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:08.469]  And they got the name Leatherneck because they wore leather armor up around their cheeks and iron helmets.
[00:37:08.789 --> 00:37:15.170]  And when the Muslims would jump on the ships and try to cut their heads off, they'd bounce off their armor.
[00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:18.969]  So that's why Marines are called Leathernecks today.
[00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:22.469]  That was the first foreign war of the United States.
[00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:23.389]  Look it up.
[00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:26.889]  That was basically the Ottoman Empire.
[00:37:28.559 --> 00:37:30.980]  My point is, this has been going on a long time.
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:37.599]  And Mayorkas and the Democrats thought, well, we'll just publicly run what we've been doing over there, over here.
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:43.440]  So you see, NATO, look it up.
[00:37:43.519 --> 00:37:47.300]  Look up NATO, human trafficking, sex trafficking, sex slavery, kidnapped children.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:53.940]  You'll have to, like, click Google images or really go back because it's no reporting in 10 years that I've seen much on.
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.800]  It used to be big.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:56.739]  I mean, there was still...
[00:37:56.739 --> 00:37:57.679]  This is wrong.
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:04.840]  They had PBS documentaries I saw 20-something years ago on PBS about the UN kidnapping all these women out of Europe.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:05.860]  I mean, this is horrible.
[00:38:06.179 --> 00:38:06.940]  And finding them?
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.400]  Oh, by the way, Israel's big on that, too.
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.219]  Israel's got a bunch of sex slaves in it.
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.920]  Israel, it's just a Middle Eastern thing, I guess.
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.260]  Look at Israel.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.340]  They're heavily involved as well.
[00:38:17.079 --> 00:38:18.079]  Saudi Arabia.
[00:38:18.679 --> 00:38:19.940]  Oh, it's disgusting.
[00:38:21.019 --> 00:38:22.960]  So this Middle Eastern flavor...
[00:38:24.889 --> 00:38:32.369]  By the way, you know, in the ancient European societies, especially the Germanic ones, the Roman histories are written on this.
[00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:36.869]  Keeping sex slaves was an executable offense, by the way.
[00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:46.670]  Yeah, 2006 Defense Department Budget House Armed Services Committee about the kidnapped kids and Dine Corps.
[00:38:47.469 --> 00:38:51.809]  By the way, you know, Dine Corps all over the country runs most of the private CPS contractors.
[00:38:54.139 --> 00:38:56.639]  So, this is a big...
[00:38:56.639 --> 00:39:04.300]  Oh, there's NATO force feeds Kosovo sex trade, London Guardian, 2004. So, it used to be a big story.
[00:39:04.539 --> 00:39:08.699]  So, we're all hearing about this here and seeing it, and the whistleblowers were like, ah, that sounds unbelievable.
[00:39:09.519 --> 00:39:11.980]  No, they were just like...
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.920]  Yeah, there's Epstein's company.
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.739]  They're like, oh...
[00:39:17.739 --> 00:39:21.340]  He flew a lot of his girls over here when they were like 10...
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.940]  And then they would become the managers over the younger girls in sex slavery later.
[00:39:28.139 --> 00:39:31.340]  And Gisling Maxwell was a sex slave of her father and a sex operative as well.
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.239]  So it was a family business.
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:35.000]  But Epstein's just a little piece of it.
[00:39:35.059 --> 00:39:36.860]  A little window, though, and a keyhole.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.039]  Like, ooh, what's going on there?
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.719]  So, see, I don't want to just come tell you about the latest.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.159]  Just a little snapshot of the past.
[00:39:44.199 --> 00:39:45.340]  You can look up all this for yourself.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.440]  So this is a giant industrial-scale...
[00:39:51.539 --> 00:39:53.139]  Yeah, there's the Times of London.
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:58.320]  Wow, that's only six years ago.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:58.659]  Wow.
[00:39:59.019 --> 00:40:06.599]  I don't know how many children I raped while working for the UN. So...
[00:40:07.719 --> 00:40:20.360]  And you've got Der Spiegel, 30-plus thousand children taken and given to convicted pedophiles by the CIA-controlled operation from the 60s to the 90s to create a, quote, new culture and to get rid of the nuclear family.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.519]  What do you think California legalizing pedophilia is about?
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.179]  It's a pedo cult.
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:29.420]  And if you're a new listener, you're like, this just can't be happening.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:30.039]  This isn't real.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:32.840]  Just search engine everything I say like the crew does.
[00:40:33.849 --> 00:40:34.929]  And it gets a lot worse.
[00:40:35.369 --> 00:40:38.670]  Look into NATO and snuff films.
[00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:40.829]  You want to read those reports?
[00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:42.949]  I've read the international police reports.
[00:40:44.409 --> 00:40:46.150]  You want me to describe one for you?
[00:40:47.389 --> 00:40:48.869]  I don't even want to think about it.
[00:40:50.639 --> 00:40:55.860]  I read one report about 25 years ago on air and a couple stations dumped me and said, we don't care if it's true.
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.019]  We can't have that on air.
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:58.739]  I understand.
[00:40:58.739 --> 00:41:14.719]  It's like parents that go to this school board and read what their sixth grader checked out in the library and it's graphic novels of men raping little boys and the little boys enjoying it, literally priming and grooming your kids and then mothers get up.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:22.969]  Our own reporters have, Christy Lee, and try to read it At the Austin school board and the police come and say, you can't read that.
[00:41:23.369 --> 00:41:25.849]  Oh, but kids can have it in the sixth grade.
[00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:36.170]  You mean to tell you about one of the stuff films that NATO, Interpol, was involved in?
[00:41:37.309 --> 00:41:38.730]  Let me describe one of them for you.
[00:41:38.929 --> 00:41:40.090]  I think I should describe it for you.
[00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.989]  You want to know?
[00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:42.409]  I don't think you want to know.
[00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:47.670]  It involves men gang raping two two-year-old boys.
[00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:53.809]  And then blowing their heads off with large revolvers.
[00:41:58.989 --> 00:42:00.610]  I'm not going to tell you the rest of it.
[00:42:02.909 --> 00:42:06.210]  Raping children until their guts spill out of the rear ends.
[00:42:06.489 --> 00:42:07.230]  Sorry, I just, you know.
[00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:08.329]  I understand.
[00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:11.269]  We're not supposed to read this at the school boards.
[00:42:11.409 --> 00:42:12.590]  We're not supposed to tell you.
[00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:17.650]  The only reason they get away with it is because it's so horrible people can't believe it.
[00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:19.969]  And that's evil's defense mechanism I'll explain coming up.
[00:42:22.269 --> 00:42:23.230]  AP exclusive.
[00:42:23.489 --> 00:42:25.929]  UN child sex ring left victims but no arrest.
[00:42:26.869 --> 00:42:29.210]  Yeah, that was one of their last big reports.
[00:42:38.469 --> 00:42:41.909]  Because obviously, if you want to rape two-year-olds, you don't want to just rape them.
[00:42:41.949 --> 00:42:43.170]  You want to hurt children.
[00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:45.929]  Can I explain it again?
[00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:49.010]  Raping children is just the gateway drug.
[00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:51.969]  They murder them.
[00:42:52.329 --> 00:42:53.489]  Oh, Washington Post.
[00:42:53.869 --> 00:42:58.250]  Obama administration placed children with human traffickers, report says.
[00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.710]  That's nine years old.
[00:43:01.869 --> 00:43:02.670]  Let's see if my memory serves.
[00:43:02.809 --> 00:43:03.150]  Scroll down.
[00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:07.909]  Is that nine years old?
[00:43:11.279 --> 00:43:16.340]  Yep, 2016. Eight and a half years ago.
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:27.400]  So see, there used to even be a soul, but around 10 years ago in the corporate media, they just basically stopped reporting.
[00:43:27.519 --> 00:43:29.940]  I mean, it's still here and there, but it used to was a big deal.
[00:43:30.079 --> 00:43:31.039]  Like, this is pretty important.
[00:43:31.099 --> 00:43:32.139]  We better report on this.
[00:43:35.269 --> 00:43:39.630]  You got all these CIA contractors disappearing these kids with little to no documentation.
[00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:44.690]  You got the federal government since Obama's third term four years ago started under Biden.
[00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:53.570]  Not doing the DNA testing of the kids when they're obviously not with their parents.
[00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:56.949]  So I've kind of set the table here.
[00:43:58.929 --> 00:44:10.809]  When you hear Tom Homan say, we've been greenlit with the task force to go after the smugglers, the NGOs, and the administration officials involved, that is the right thing to do.
[00:44:10.929 --> 00:44:12.050]  We need to find the children.
[00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:15.309]  We need to then prosecute the people that did it so they can't do it again.
[00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:31.449]  And then it'll take down the entire globalist network that uses the sex slavery as a currency of control and of Initiation rituals.
[00:44:33.929 --> 00:44:36.489]  So justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:38.849]  This is the reality.
[00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:41.949]  How evil will evil get?
[00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:43.250]  As evil as you let it.
[00:44:43.449 --> 00:44:44.570]  It has no limits.
[00:44:44.989 --> 00:44:48.670]  They just killed 30 million plus people with the poison shots insurance actuaries.
[00:44:49.630 --> 00:45:06.349]  Major British Oxford Harvard study Every one of the new heart attack, myocarditis cases in children, 1.7 million, was injected with the Pfizer shot alone.
[00:45:07.329 --> 00:45:08.530]  I've got the study right here.
[00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:09.170]  I'll get to that.
[00:45:12.849 --> 00:45:15.070]  You're like, why would you do something like that?
[00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:16.610]  Well, there's a lot of reasons.
[00:45:16.769 --> 00:45:17.610]  I'll explain it next hour.
[00:45:17.849 --> 00:45:22.750]  Because if you understand the mindset of why they do it, there's a philosophy.
[00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:25.349]  See, there's two types of knowledge.
[00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:28.289]  There's knowledge of good, and there's knowledge of evil.
[00:45:28.449 --> 00:45:31.309]  And knowledge means you'd understand how the systems work.
[00:45:32.449 --> 00:45:36.550]  One builds strength and beauty and honor and life and power and success.
[00:45:36.769 --> 00:45:38.929]  The other, destruction and death and betrayal.
[00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:41.230]  But there are ways you can do things.
[00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:45.610]  And see, good people don't really have knowledge of evil.
[00:45:47.489 --> 00:45:52.530]  Which you can say is good at one level, because when no one has knowledge of it, no one does it.
[00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:55.309]  And you just operate on as God designed you.
[00:45:55.469 --> 00:46:05.349]  But since evil's been introduced and evil systems developed and set up as perpetual motion machines, we need to stop being naive and face the horror.
[00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:10.550]  If you want to dismantle the horror...
[00:46:13.199 --> 00:46:18.400]  You don't make a friend of horror, as Colonel Kurtz says in Apocalypse Now.
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:34.800]  You make it your mortal enemy so that you can know it, but then understand it and put yourself in its shoes, in its boots, so you can understand why it's doing it.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.719]  Because killing people is just part of it.
[00:46:48.489 --> 00:46:48.909]  I will.
[00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:50.110]  I still have three plus hours coming up.
[00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:53.469]  I'll get to everything else, but I need to spend some more time on this, as you can see.
[00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:56.889]  Because I could go for 10 hours just on this.
[00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:57.429]  That's a problem.
[00:46:58.369 --> 00:46:59.469]  Like, when do you cut it off?
[00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:04.250]  Because I just keep going and going and going and going, and people go, oh, I'm told about lizards.
[00:47:04.349 --> 00:47:05.550]  That's when they go, oh, yeah, oh.
[00:47:05.849 --> 00:47:07.050]  Because you don't need to just hear it from me.
[00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:08.269]  You're like, oh, yeah, that's how they go.
[00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:09.750]  Oh, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:47:09.889 --> 00:47:10.550]  Oh, yeah, see?
[00:47:10.789 --> 00:47:11.429]  Oh, yeah.
[00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:12.969]  You put the glasses on.
[00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:13.949]  It's not me telling you.
[00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:15.030]  You just see it now.
[00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:21.599]  And once you see it, There's no going back.
[00:47:22.199 --> 00:47:27.039]  It's like Morpheus tells Neo, listen, I'm not promising you anything but reality, okay?
[00:47:27.239 --> 00:47:29.400]  You take the blue pill, you go back to Wonderland.
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:33.340]  You take the red pill, you come to reality, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[00:47:41.039 --> 00:47:42.940]  All I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:54.119]  And yeah, it's the metaphor in such a great screenplay of an amazing novel of They Live.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.920]  Where the glasses give you a headache.
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.000]  It's just like, what?
[00:48:03.539 --> 00:48:05.480]  Yeah, it's easy to be in the Matrix.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.559]  But it'll kill you.
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:07.440]  Kill your soul.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.699]  But it's easy on the surface.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:10.980]  Just like not exercising.
[00:48:11.699 --> 00:48:14.920]  Sitting on your ass and eating bonbons all day and weighing 400 pounds.
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:20.960]  So we're going to start the next hour.
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:26.219]  I'm going to play all the clips, get to it all, finish up at least 20 minutes, and then I'm going to go to all the rest of it, I promise.
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:26.860]  It's important.
[00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:29.710]  And then we'll cut this live show up.
[00:48:29.789 --> 00:48:38.789]  And I have a sneaking suspicion my report on the globalist plan to trigger martial law once Trump gets in will be listened to by the president and everyone else.
[00:48:38.989 --> 00:48:42.670]  And they'll say, oh yeah, we already see all the pieces of that.
[00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:43.650]  We already knew that.
[00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:45.710]  But were you paying attention?
[00:48:45.929 --> 00:48:54.809]  See, the reason I'm so successful at getting corporations and governments to listen to me that aren't committed to evil and the bad guys listen to is they already know all this.
[00:48:54.969 --> 00:48:56.590]  They're just not paying attention.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.300]  They get distracted.
[00:48:58.559 --> 00:49:01.659]  My job is to get people back on target.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.460]  What are the bad guys planning?
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.099]  What have they signaled?
[00:49:05.219 --> 00:49:06.280]  What have they telegraphed?
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:09.239]  Show that we're waiting for them when they try it.
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:12.400]  Or the bad guys get smart and run up that white flag.
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.079]  Which I'm seeing a lot more of.
[00:49:17.159 --> 00:49:21.099]  And so instead of getting depressed, just focusing on the evil, I have prayed about it.
[00:49:21.159 --> 00:49:24.260]  I've decided to be very happy and appreciate the victories we're having.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:29.559]  And that's why I'm probably going too far the other way and having a little bit of reveling and shortening.
[00:49:31.579 --> 00:49:33.119]  But this is better than being upset.
[00:49:34.139 --> 00:49:36.360]  Because we are starting to have big victory, and I thank God.
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:40.719]  But I also ask God to temper my celebrations a bit.
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.519]  Because we need to not be overconfident.
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:45.480]  Though things are going quite well.
[00:49:46.179 --> 00:49:47.480]  So that's coming up.
[00:49:49.559 --> 00:49:52.420]  I've been waiting a long time for this globalist.
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:54.840]  You know it too, don't you?
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:50:07.940]  So, if you think this show, exposing the enemy's next moves and winning is important, I humbly ask you to do the right thing, get incredible products, and keep us on the air.

[00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:27.019]  The best gut cleanse.
[00:50:27.159 --> 00:50:32.840]  The best vitamin, mineral, hydro-relief, hydro-force.

[00:53:01.559 --> 00:53:04.780]  And that is the special right now.
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:06.760]  Black Friday, Cyber Monday.
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:11.539]  Right now, 25% off site-wide on top of all the discounts.
[00:53:11.739 --> 00:53:13.579]  And so some of these are lost leaders now.
[00:53:13.619 --> 00:53:14.900]  So I should have told you about that.
[00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:17.449]  It's just automatic at checkout on top of the other specials.
[00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:18.289]  That's insane.
[00:53:18.489 --> 00:53:23.030]  That's why the owner of the company was here last week and he said, he said, Alex, you say we do too many discounts.
[00:53:23.269 --> 00:53:24.150]  Sometimes they're not enough profit.
[00:53:24.269 --> 00:53:25.250]  He goes, we're really going to hate this.
[00:53:25.409 --> 00:53:25.869]  Uh, yeah.
[00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:35.199]  But their thought is you're going to love the product so much, you will get addicted to the ultimate CMOS. What it does, your energy, stamina, libido, focus, clarity, health.
[00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:36.500]  It's just a total superfood.
[00:53:36.579 --> 00:53:37.380]  That's what I'm on right now.
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:39.280]  People see how my skin glows, so much energy.
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.239]  It's just amazing.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:42.179]  So we try to make it easy for you to support.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.280]  You really want the supplements at TheAlexShieldStore.com.
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:46.500]  They really are game-changing.
[00:53:46.579 --> 00:53:47.239]  They really do work.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:48.019]  They really are amazing.
[00:53:48.199 --> 00:53:51.780]  The t-shirts, hundreds and hundreds of great designs of ball caps, t-shirts, hoodies.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:52.880]  I mean, they're just amazing.
[00:53:53.099 --> 00:53:53.920]  So proud of them.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.480]  With our great sponsor, The Alex Shield Store.
[00:53:55.619 --> 00:53:56.800]  Which, again, is not owned by me.
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:00.119]  Even if the bad guys are able to get InfoWars, they have no claim on that.
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:02.219]  It'll continue on as our sponsor at the Alex Jones Network.
[00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:04.800]  So now is the time to take action.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:08.300]  The Alex Jones gear, the Patriot gear, the 1776 gear.
[00:54:08.519 --> 00:54:15.420]  I'd put it in Trump gear, Alex Jones InfoWars gear, and Patriot 1776 Founding Father type stuff.
[00:54:15.579 --> 00:54:16.559]  That's my favorite gear.
[00:54:16.699 --> 00:54:18.860]  And funny, the stuff I like the best is the best selling.
[00:54:19.099 --> 00:54:21.199]  It goes Patriot gear, Alex Jones gear.
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.829]  It's the same thing, but, you know, with And then the Trump gear.
[00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:28.769]  And these are great Trump gear, but quite frankly, the Trump, that shirt's really popular right there.
[00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:31.849]  Trump, better coverage than Verizon, now do you hear us.
[00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:35.469]  But no, the Trump gear is the least popular category.
[00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:38.050]  People like the anti-New World Order, pro-America stuff.
[00:54:38.289 --> 00:54:38.690]  That's...
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.340]  That's what I guess would be most popular.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.199]  That's what's most popular.
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:43.239]  I would think Team Humanity would be very popular.
[00:54:43.239 --> 00:54:43.679]  It's not.
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.380]  That's what we are on.
[00:54:45.719 --> 00:54:50.199]  So, and then as I said, also all those other specials and more.
[00:54:50.519 --> 00:54:51.980]  So 25% off on top of everything.
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:53.340]  At checkout, it's just automatic.
[00:54:53.719 --> 00:54:56.860]  And 40% off on the t-shirts and hats.
[00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:02.469]  35% off on the hoodies, 30% off on the supplement bundle on top of the other specials.
[00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:14.210]  And VIP members will be emailed a link where you'll either have $30, $40, or $50 extra on top of the $40 you get a month being a VIP to spend in the store for $30 a month you spend.
[00:55:14.389 --> 00:55:16.730]  And you get all those other great specials, cancel anytime.
[00:55:16.969 --> 00:55:19.329]  All at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:55:28.849 --> 00:55:31.150]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars is back on the air.
[00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:32.869]  The judge is having emergency hearings.
[00:55:32.989 --> 00:55:35.010]  Looks like their fraudulent sale won't go through.
[00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:42.469]  But regardless, I'm suing the daylights out of the Democratic Party and the big national gun control group that's actually behind the onion and has now admitted it in court.
[00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:45.389]  So, we also have backup studios at the Alex Jones Network.
[00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:52.489]  Whatever they do, we're staying on air to make sure Trump gets into office and to back him and his agenda to stop World War III, secure the borders and more.
[00:55:52.909 --> 00:55:54.369]  We can't do it without your support.
[00:55:54.530 --> 00:56:01.889]  So there are all these new, amazing, incredible designs up on thealexjonesstore.com that has nothing to do with InfoWars.
[00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:04.809]  Not owned by me, so they can never get that.
[00:56:04.929 --> 00:56:08.130]  That's how we stay on the air even if they're successful in shutting us down.
[00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:18.670]  If you go to thealexjonesstore.com and you get great supplements, t-shirts, limited edition collectible fundraiser, posters, and more, you will keep me on the air regardless of the Alex Jones Network.
[00:56:18.929 --> 00:56:20.289]  Please go to the site now.
[00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:23.369]  TheAlexJonesStore.com and keep us on air.
[00:56:23.449 --> 00:56:24.530]  They're amazing products.
[00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:26.050]  Thank you so much for taking action.
[00:56:26.269 --> 00:56:27.130]  You are the resistance.
[00:56:28.809 --> 00:56:43.630]  Alright, I'm going to run through the rest of the devastating activities of the incoming Trump administration where they are openly announcing that they are going to criminally go after the entire human trafficking sex network of the New World Order.
[00:56:44.579 --> 00:56:46.340]  And hey, it's the right thing to do.
[00:56:46.559 --> 00:56:47.840]  They're not giving anybody quarter.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.079]  We've got to find these kids.
[00:56:49.599 --> 00:56:51.059]  So just let them have it.
[00:56:51.159 --> 00:56:52.159]  We'll destroy them all.
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:56.219]  It'll annihilate the leftist globalist parties, all of them.
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:57:00.659]  It'll go right up to BlackRock, right up to the top globalists, and we just have to do it.
[00:57:00.699 --> 00:57:02.440]  Or they're going to have World War III and kill us all.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.079]  See, that's the thing.
[00:57:04.119 --> 00:57:06.659]  It's the right thing to do anyway, so we should have been doing it.
[00:57:07.139 --> 00:57:09.139]  But also, these people aren't going to go away.
[00:57:09.199 --> 00:57:10.159]  We've got to just get them.
[00:57:11.599 --> 00:57:13.159]  And this will unify everybody.
[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:16.099]  It's the end of the new world order if we want it.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:22.320]  It'll still be evil, but it'll have to hide and creep around the shadows, not run around doing it in mass scale in front of everybody.
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:25.420]  Now, a lot of stations don't carry this first five.
[00:57:25.559 --> 00:57:27.480]  Remember, we're on 400 plus stations now.
[00:57:28.079 --> 00:57:29.679]  Streisand effect, and thank all the stations.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:30.519]  Be sure and support them.
[00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:37.429]  So when we come back at 6 after, I'm going to just judiciously hit this, Cash Patel info, finish up, play the clips.
[00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:39.030]  I've already given you the background on the last hour.
[00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:39.909]  I know most of you already knew that.
[00:57:39.969 --> 00:57:42.230]  Remember, we're reaching new people that are waking up now.
[00:57:43.239 --> 00:57:46.119]  And if you're a new viewer of the cruise, just putting in whatever I say.
[00:57:48.079 --> 00:57:49.780]  They found the congressional testimony video.
[00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:50.599]  We'll play that.
[00:57:51.039 --> 00:57:53.599]  Problem is it's hours long, but we'll see if they found the right clip.
[00:57:53.719 --> 00:57:54.219]  Not their fault.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:58.079]  They can't know exactly which clip I want, but I have to go check it during the break and make sure it's there.
[00:57:58.639 --> 00:58:02.139]  But keeping us on air is the key to this victory, and I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:58:02.179 --> 00:58:02.880]  Here's an important message.
[00:58:04.269 --> 00:58:10.909]  My dad is chemistry background, also a retired doctor, but he came in to help me run my supplement division 13 years ago.
[00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:12.710]  The deep state sued the hell out of him.
[00:58:12.809 --> 00:58:14.150]  We're going to our guest in a moment, but I gotta do this.
[00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:14.570]  Thank you, sir.
[00:58:15.130 --> 00:58:18.730]  And they basically almost destroyed my parents.
[00:58:18.849 --> 00:58:25.289]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family that my dad was at the edge of bankruptcy himself with all the lawsuits the Democrats filed.
[00:58:25.449 --> 00:58:29.309]  By the way, they said in court that their attorney's fees are $316 million yesterday.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.239]  They filed before they've spent $80 million suing me.
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.059]  We've spent $16 million fighting them.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.940]  My dad spent $2 million fighting them.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.099]  And we're finally winning.
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:48.619]  Not only does my dad's supplement company, drjonesnaturals.com, have some of the best supplements, it is a personal request I ask you to support him because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[00:58:48.739 --> 00:58:51.260]  He was giving everything to Infowars.
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:58.800]  And then personally going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me because that's how dads are.
[00:58:59.159 --> 00:59:00.300]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:05.340]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office.
[00:59:05.519 --> 00:59:06.579]  And I got pissed.
[00:59:07.199 --> 00:59:14.320]  So, it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[00:59:14.949 --> 00:59:16.030]  The supplements are there.
[00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:16.809]  They're great.
[00:59:16.989 --> 00:59:18.170]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:19.530]  He's put everything into it he has.
[00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:20.190]  They're incredible.
[00:59:20.550 --> 00:59:30.130]  I've given so much to this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything, that I don't want to belabor this.
[00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:31.449]  We have important topics to cover.
[00:59:32.269 --> 00:59:33.510]  Please support us.
[00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:35.730]  Go to drjonesdadryls.com.
[00:59:35.849 --> 00:59:36.530]  There's a new sale.
[00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:38.210]  Everything is 30% off.
[00:59:38.409 --> 00:59:39.610]  Next Level Fundational Energy.
[00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:40.869]  All fluoride-free toothpaste.
[00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:42.130]  Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver.
[00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:47.829]  CoQ10 and Corsets and Macs that are high-end Corsets and CoQ10 for 40% off.
[00:59:48.070 --> 00:59:50.250]  Or try these other amazing products.
[00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:53.489]  Ultimate Longevity Pack for 50% off.
[00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:54.389]  A big sale.
[00:59:54.550 --> 01:00:01.690]  And my dad literally took a loan last week to be able to buy the product that's coming in finally today.
[01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:04.550]  Next week, turbo force, things like that that are popular.
[01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:07.250]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[01:00:07.809 --> 01:00:11.750]  And the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down.
[01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:13.409]  My dad won't stop fighting.
[01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:14.170]  He's a fighter.
[01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:15.130]  Hell, he's my dad.
[01:00:15.309 --> 01:00:16.269]  I think I'm a fighter.
[01:00:16.489 --> 01:00:17.909]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[01:00:18.570 --> 01:00:26.090]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:28.949]  But this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:30.030]  It's about my parents.
[01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:36.150]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's what the enemy targeted them.
[01:00:37.809 --> 01:00:39.630]  Please support the Infowar today.
[01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:41.750]  Support my mother and my father.
[01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:44.750]  I'm asking you personally for you to do it now.
[01:00:44.969 --> 01:00:47.630]  And at 5% of the millions watching, we go do it.
[01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:49.469]  All our problems will be over in one minute.
[01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:55.130]  But it's less than one half, one percent to ever buy anything from drjonesnacros.com or the AlexJonesStore.com.
[01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:57.929]  And for those that do support, thank you for keeping us in the fight.
[01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:25.050]  I'm going to show you Satanist what it's like.
[01:01:30.029 --> 01:01:30.829]  Yes.
[01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:32.309]  I'll get you.
[01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:34.449]  You'll burn.
[01:01:34.849 --> 01:01:37.190]  We've got our hands around their throats.
[01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:44.789]  And now all we gotta do is squeeze and focus and watch those eyes go blank.
[01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:47.869]  Politically, non-violently, lovingly.
[01:01:52.059 --> 01:01:53.000]  Yeah, let me show you a reporter.
[01:01:53.139 --> 01:02:00.179]  I just showed you BBC, AP, Reuters, Giant, UN, DynCorp, Halliburton, child kidnapping, slave rings run worldwide.
[01:02:01.139 --> 01:02:03.679]  And until about 10 years ago, it was in the news all the time.
[01:02:04.659 --> 01:02:08.820]  Evidence of sexual exploitation and abuse in the aid sector.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.539]  Big International.
[01:02:11.239 --> 01:02:12.280]  Amnesty International.
[01:02:14.239 --> 01:02:16.380]  Parliamentary reports out of the UK right here.
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:27.699]  And then Cash Patel says we're going after the international child trafficking networks and the Drudge Report and the Washington Post say he's a conspiracy theorist.
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:35.260]  They said it's like if you cross Alex Jones with J. Edgar Hoover.
[01:02:38.539 --> 01:02:39.880]  Oh my God.
[01:02:40.079 --> 01:02:42.940]  If you actually knew about J. Edgar Hoover, he was one of their people.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.219]  That's how they controlled him.
[01:02:45.739 --> 01:02:48.599]  This sex crap's been going on for a long time.
[01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:54.130]  And people are finally waking up.
[01:02:56.329 --> 01:03:00.369]  It's not just the right thing to do to save the children and stop this stuff.
[01:03:01.989 --> 01:03:08.750]  You don't stop the new world order unless you bring this down.
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:13.340]  You think God's just going to let evil attack these kids and we're not going to get judged?
[01:03:13.599 --> 01:03:14.559]  Yeah, put the headline back up.
[01:03:14.699 --> 01:03:15.820]  Oh, look!
[01:03:16.599 --> 01:03:22.559]  MSNBC writer says Kash Patel as FBI director would be like if you crossed Alex Jones with J. Edgar Hoover.
[01:03:23.179 --> 01:03:24.059]  That's hilarious.
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:27.900]  They are crapping their britches.
[01:03:29.719 --> 01:03:32.099]  So, they did dig it up.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:49.190]  There's hours of this testimony, but this is from 2004, 2006, I forget, but they had congressional hearings and this came up, and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld didn't even deny it.
[01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:50.289]  He's like, yeah, no big deal.
[01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:53.090]  So this is the arrogance.
[01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:57.150]  And of course, DynCorp and these companies were never put in a penalty box.
[01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:58.090]  They didn't even get in trouble.
[01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:00.150]  They didn't even lose their contractability.
[01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:04.789]  Yeah, it was the 2006 Defense Department Budget, House Armed Services Committee.
[01:04:04.929 --> 01:04:05.630]  Here's part of the clip.
[01:04:08.159 --> 01:04:12.019]  I thank the gentleman, the gentlelady from Georgia, Ms. McKinney.
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:14.320]  Oh, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[01:04:16.039 --> 01:04:29.360]  Mr. Secretary, I watched President Bush deliver a moving speech at the United Nations in September 2003, in which he mentioned the crisis of the sex trade.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:34.340]  The President called for the punishment of those involved in this horrible business.
[01:04:34.679 --> 01:04:43.340]  But at the very moment of that speech, DynCorp was exposed for having been involved in the buying and selling of young women and children.
[01:04:44.289 --> 01:04:56.809]  While all of this was going on, DynCorp kept the Pentagon contract to administer the smallpox-nanthrax vaccines and is now working on a plague vaccine through the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program.
[01:04:58.119 --> 01:05:03.880]  Mr. Secretary, is it policy of the U.S. government to reward companies that traffic in women and little girls?
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:05.699]  That's my first question.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:17.019]  My second question, Mr. Secretary, according to the Comptroller General of the United States, there are serious financial management problems at the Pentagon, to which Mr. Cooper alluded.
[01:05:17.719 --> 01:05:21.059]  Fiscal year 1999, 2.3 trillion missing.
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:24.820]  Fiscal year 2000, 1.1 trillion missing.
[01:05:25.639 --> 01:05:30.420]  And DOD is the number one reason why the government can't balance its checkbook.
[01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:38.590]  The Pentagon has claimed year after year that the reason it can't account for the money is because its computers don't communicate with each other.
[01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:46.730]  My second question, Mr. Secretary, is who has the contracts today to make those systems communicate with each other?
[01:05:46.989 --> 01:05:49.670]  How long have they had those contracts?
[01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:52.829]  And how much have the taxpayers paid for them?
[01:05:53.590 --> 01:06:03.809]  Finally, Mr. Secretary, after the last hearing, I thought that my office was promised a written response to my question regarding the four war games on September 11th.
[01:06:03.989 --> 01:06:16.909]  I have not yet received that response, but would like for you to respond to the questions that I've put to you today, and then I do expect the written response to my previous question, hopefully by the end of the week.
[01:06:19.139 --> 01:06:21.699]  Thank you, Representative.
[01:06:22.699 --> 01:06:27.119]  First, the answer to your first question is no, absolutely not.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:37.260]  The policy of the United States government is clear, unambiguous, and opposed to the activities that you described.
[01:06:37.579 --> 01:06:50.769]  The second question Well, how do you explain the fact that Dyncor and its successor companies have received and continue to receive government contracts?
[01:06:52.369 --> 01:07:07.190]  I would have to go and find the facts, but there are laws and rules and regulations with respect to government contracts, and there are times that corporations do things they should not do, in which case they tend to be suspended for some period.
[01:07:07.449 --> 01:07:25.849]  There are times then that under the laws and the rules and regulations passed by the Congress and implemented by the executive branch, that corporations can get off of Out of the penalty box, if you will, and be permitted to engage in contracts with the government.
[01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:29.050]  They're generally not barred in perpetuity.
[01:07:29.269 --> 01:07:33.710]  This company was never in the penalty box.
[01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:35.690]  If you could proceed to my second question, please.
[01:07:36.849 --> 01:07:39.610]  The second question...
[01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:46.969]  I've forgotten what the second question was.
[01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:49.289]  I think Ms. Jonas knows it.
[01:07:49.449 --> 01:07:49.730]  Okay.
[01:07:52.130 --> 01:07:53.550]  Thank you, Ms. McKinney.
[01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:54.429]  I appreciate the question.
[01:07:54.590 --> 01:07:57.690]  I appreciate your interest in the department's financial condition.
[01:07:57.909 --> 01:07:59.030]  All right, let's stop right there.
[01:07:59.349 --> 01:08:02.250]  And of course, another decade, same story.
[01:08:02.429 --> 01:08:03.949]  Trillions more are missing from the Pentagon.
[01:08:05.449 --> 01:08:07.550]  And boy, they don't want Trump investigating that.
[01:08:07.869 --> 01:08:09.289]  Well, you're not the government.
[01:08:09.289 --> 01:08:10.289]  You work for us.
[01:08:10.369 --> 01:08:11.170]  This is out of control.
[01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:12.409]  It's been out of control forever.
[01:08:13.369 --> 01:08:26.229]  So when we hear about Mayorkas and Harris and Biden and all them of this massive record level human trafficking in the millions, 25 million total, millions, not just 325,000.
[01:08:27.289 --> 01:08:31.510]  They've had the ICE top people say, oh, it's in the millions.
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:45.279]  Over a million children, but what they know that they had and were ordered to turn over, in many cases with no documentation, babies as young as three months old, loaded on airplanes with no diapers, no milk, no formula.
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:50.399]  I played the congressional testimony and had the whistleblowers here in studio for a new viewer.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.779]  And the whistleblowers are sitting there.
[01:08:55.039 --> 01:08:56.319]  This is right when Biden got in.
[01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:56.979]  They've been doing this before.
[01:08:57.079 --> 01:08:57.899]  None of this happened under Trump.
[01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:01.150]  Stopped.
[01:09:01.150 --> 01:09:03.130]  It was going on some under Obama.
[01:09:04.210 --> 01:09:07.010]  And they're like, they're not telling you where you're going.
[01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:08.170]  And you fly to one destination.
[01:09:08.449 --> 01:09:10.149]  They're on the plane for like 10 hours.
[01:09:10.489 --> 01:09:12.909]  And the children are defecating all over the place.
[01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:14.609]  Babies.
[01:09:14.829 --> 01:09:16.850]  And there's not even food for them.
[01:09:17.729 --> 01:09:22.649]  And then they land on a tarmac and buses pull up and they just hand babies over.
[01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:25.789]  In some cases with no information at all.
[01:09:26.050 --> 01:09:27.050]  Not, who is this?
[01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:28.430]  What's the kid's name?
[01:09:28.670 --> 01:09:30.170]  I mean, that...
[01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:39.689]  You need a driver's license to get a library card, but not to vote in these states that vote Democrat.
[01:09:39.689 --> 01:09:42.829]  Every state that doesn't have voter IDs, whether they stay in power.
[01:09:45.109 --> 01:09:45.590]  So...
[01:09:47.109 --> 01:09:53.189]  I could talk for 100 hours about this, there's so much evidence, but the point is, this is not new, it's just getting worse, and it's out in the open.
[01:09:56.250 --> 01:10:10.250]  And when it really started to become a top issue 10 years ago, big money came in to the universities and the think tanks and the watchdog NGOs against the other NGOs and the corporate media, and it just stopped.
[01:10:11.109 --> 01:10:14.949]  It went from a deluge, a fire hose of information to a trickle.
[01:10:15.729 --> 01:10:25.750]  And it's gotten much worse and is now out in the open with almost no resistance to it other than conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones and Kash Patel.
[01:10:26.369 --> 01:10:31.229]  Yeah, Kash Patel was the deputy head of one of the most important intelligence agencies.
[01:10:32.010 --> 01:10:36.609]  Oh, but he's a conspiracy theorist about releasing the Epstein list that they admit they have, they won't release?
[01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:38.010]  That's not a conspiracy theory.
[01:10:38.289 --> 01:10:42.029]  Or going after the NGOs that did the record-level human trafficking here in America?
[01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.390]  Yeah.
[01:10:44.010 --> 01:10:49.090]  Are Tom Homan saying we're going after the NGOs, the UN, and the administration operatives?
[01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:50.710]  Yes!
[01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:51.529]  Yes!
[01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:52.449]  Yes!
[01:10:54.409 --> 01:11:03.750]  And if they just do that, because the Globals are coming after us anyways, and I say that to people in government, that are not bad people, they're like, if we really do this, the public can't handle it.
[01:11:04.109 --> 01:11:06.350]  Yeah, the public can handle the truth.
[01:11:06.609 --> 01:11:07.510]  Remember in a few good men?
[01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:12.810]  Jack Nicholson playing the Marine Corps officer, talking to the Marine Corps lawyer.
[01:11:14.659 --> 01:11:17.659]  Or the Navy lawyer, Tom Cruise.
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:19.840]  He says, you want answers?
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.279]  I'll give you the answers.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.079]  You want the truth?
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:24.760]  You can't handle the truth.
[01:11:24.939 --> 01:11:31.760]  Well, you can handle the truth because living under the tyranny of denying all this stuff is a trillion times worse.
[01:11:33.319 --> 01:11:36.579]  Infowars, because you can handle the truth.
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:38.560]  You want answers?
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.039]  I got answers for you.
[01:11:41.909 --> 01:11:42.869]  You don't have to believe me.
[01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:45.890]  You can go check out every damn thing I say.
[01:11:56.329 --> 01:12:00.069]  Including calling to the minute when Trump would come out and announce his victory.
[01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:01.029]  Two and a half hours before.
[01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:08.350]  A little over the horizon stuff, too.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:16.359]  And if I get told to do a lot more than I will, but only when I get told to.
[01:12:16.739 --> 01:12:20.760]  Oh, and it's not from the Mercers or the Vatican or the Israelis.
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.100]  I don't get told to do anything by them.
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:23.859]  I get told by the Holy Spirit.
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:27.960]  And that's why the bad guys don't like this show.
[01:12:31.399 --> 01:12:33.039]  So, let's continue here.
[01:12:33.899 --> 01:12:35.560]  And yeah, I'm very satisfied.
[01:12:36.239 --> 01:12:37.100]  I wouldn't call it...
[01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:47.229]  It borders on reveling, because these people are really evil, and they are going to continue to attack everybody, and things are going to get a lot darker if we don't turn this around.
[01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:53.210]  And I see humanity starting to really wake up fast and turn the ship around, and that's very exciting.
[01:12:54.079 --> 01:12:55.960]  It'd be really nice to not have a nuclear war.
[01:12:56.119 --> 01:12:59.840]  Wouldn't it be really nice to stabilize inflation and get lower energy costs?
[01:12:59.939 --> 01:13:01.779]  It'd be really nice to go after hardcore criminals.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.180]  It'd be really nice to free children and sex slavery.
[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:05.300]  It'd be really good.
[01:13:05.539 --> 01:13:06.640]  It'd be really good.
[01:13:06.819 --> 01:13:07.739]  Wouldn't it be nice?
[01:13:07.859 --> 01:13:09.060]  Yeah, well, we're getting there.
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.460]  And it's real.
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:18.000]  And Rob Reiner and all these leftists are leaving the country and leaving X and checking themselves into mental institutions and bragging about it.
[01:13:19.819 --> 01:13:21.000]  Because, folks...
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:25.819]  They're all part of this thing you don't get in those clubs.
[01:13:31.579 --> 01:13:37.720]  I was talking to an individual, I'll sleep with a tat, about pedophiles in Hollywood a few days ago.
[01:13:38.619 --> 01:13:42.239]  And he said, oh yeah, let me tell you about, I mean, the person knows these people.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.199]  And I said, oh, he's a such and such, how do you know?
[01:13:45.279 --> 01:13:46.659]  And I got told that by a movie producer.
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.560]  18, 19 years ago.
[01:13:49.899 --> 01:13:50.859]  He was just going down a list.
[01:13:50.979 --> 01:13:53.060]  This person, that person, this person.
[01:13:53.239 --> 01:13:55.060]  And I said, well, we gotta go tell the police that.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.699]  And he's like, well, I mean, I just talked to the guys that saw it.
[01:14:01.779 --> 01:14:03.760]  I said, well, you need to get them to go to the police.
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:21.760]  And it was a very well-known Hollywood person that when they're on location and shoots in Latin America with the security team, That just grab women out of the villages and just rape them.
[01:14:24.779 --> 01:14:25.479]  And kids.
[01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:34.520]  And that's just, you know, that's just, that's just the way this works.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.779]  So, yeah, this is going on.
[01:14:39.899 --> 01:14:41.239]  These people think they're God.
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:43.939]  They like to hurt good people.
[01:14:47.819 --> 01:14:53.680]  You want to give a nice little kid you see in some village a balloon or give him a piece of candy or something to be nice to him?
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.760]  No, these people want to murder him because it's about them.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.779]  They destroy somebody's future.
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:14:59.720]  They got power.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.659]  They get off on evil.
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:07.760]  And the more you commit evil, the more you get into it, you need to do more of it and more of it and more of it and more of it.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:08.720]  Read about psychotics.
[01:15:08.819 --> 01:15:09.659]  Read about psychopaths.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:12.260]  Read about serial killers when they talk to psychiatrists.
[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:15.760]  The only time they're happy is when they're doing something really nasty.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.020]  Like arsonists and all these people.
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:21.060]  They like doing bad things.
[01:15:25.399 --> 01:15:29.000]  And these Hollywood movies where the Joker's a hero now.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.800]  He's so intellectual.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:31.859]  He's so good.
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:33.800]  He wants to burn down the world.
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.899]  Oh, he's a good person.
[01:15:36.239 --> 01:15:36.520]  No.
[01:15:36.939 --> 01:15:40.000]  The Joker needs a bullet in the back of his head.
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:44.699]  He's not cool.
[01:15:44.699 --> 01:15:46.359]  He's a piece of crap.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:52.539]  That archetype of the smiling joker, that demon, that punk.
[01:15:55.359 --> 01:16:01.039]  So, here's a clip at home and a full interview from Fox is up there that's being announced.
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:03.659]  The task forces you heard Flynn weeks ago say, no, they're doing it.
[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:06.340]  He's like, don't go to the whole plan, Alex.
[01:16:06.439 --> 01:16:07.779]  I'm like, well, it's obviously the plan.
[01:16:09.010 --> 01:16:11.130]  It's the right thing to do and it will take them down.
[01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:12.310]  I mean, it's the big daddy.
[01:16:12.649 --> 01:16:14.229]  You want to demonize the establishment?
[01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:16.149]  You want to destroy them forever because they are demons?
[01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:18.430]  You go, you unravel this sucker.
[01:16:18.850 --> 01:16:22.590]  They're all getting put in prison.
[01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:26.390]  And then some.
[01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:30.729]  And a lot of them are committing suicide.
[01:16:30.729 --> 01:16:32.270]  A lot of them are leaving the country now.
[01:16:32.670 --> 01:16:33.409]  It's happening.
[01:16:36.819 --> 01:16:37.939]  And that's going to happen.
[01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:40.520]  I mean, a lot of them are going to fall down and hit their heads.
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:52.960]  So, these jokers are in a lot of trouble because he who laughs last wins.
[01:16:54.739 --> 01:16:56.420]  But we're not going to be laughing.
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:00.180]  We're just taking out the trash.
[01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:02.180]  Doing our duty.
[01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:05.420]  You wanna burn down the world?
[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:06.720]  We're gonna burn you down.
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:09.399]  Here's Tom Homan.
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:12.479]  Not because of mismanagement, not because of incompetence by design.
[01:17:12.779 --> 01:17:13.739]  They want this open border.
[01:17:13.819 --> 01:17:22.039]  They obviously think these millions of people will be future Democratic voters, but also he overturned the Trump census rule with millions of people in sanctuary cities recounting the next census.
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:23.060]  And what does that mean?
[01:17:23.199 --> 01:17:24.640]  More seats in house for the Dems.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:31.260]  But I tell you what, the Trump team coming to town, we're going to take control January 20th, and people are going to be held accountable.
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:32.659]  We're going to be very transparent.
[01:17:32.739 --> 01:17:37.189]  We're going to get behind What did the United Nations have to do with this open border crisis?
[01:17:37.449 --> 01:17:42.310]  Who in the administration, the Biden administration, opened the doors on this humanitarian crisis?
[01:17:42.529 --> 01:17:44.149]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:48.430]  We're going to be very transparent American people, and we're going to tell them the truth of what happened on this border.
[01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:53.829]  Again, by design, and we're going to let the American people know who was involved, why, and hold them accountable.
[01:17:55.770 --> 01:17:57.590]  And hold them accountable.
[01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.890]  Tell me more.
[01:18:01.989 --> 01:18:02.810]  I already know.
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:13.960]  Because I can play chess as good as a lot of folks, and this is a real chess board with our lives involved, and we have them in check.
[01:18:22.029 --> 01:18:24.750]  And it's not just the first order right thing to do.
[01:18:24.930 --> 01:18:39.289]  It's the second order, the third order, the fourth order, the fifth order, the sixth order, the seventh order, the eighth order, the ninth order, the tenth order, the eleventh order, the twelfth order.
[01:18:39.869 --> 01:18:41.590]  Oh, my goodness.
[01:18:43.449 --> 01:18:49.250]  The twelfth order is the mind of God, perfection, eternity, total completion.
[01:18:50.739 --> 01:18:53.760]  Here's a couple little clips with the rats leaving the sinking ship.
[01:18:54.319 --> 01:18:58.680]  The bag man for the Obamas and others with hundreds of criminal operations is Hunter.
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.779]  They believe by giving him cover, it gives them cover.
[01:19:01.819 --> 01:19:02.500]  It's not gonna work.
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:03.859]  Here's some clips, I'm gonna explain why.
[01:19:04.359 --> 01:19:09.699]  From a presidential perspective, is there any possibility that the president would end up pardoning his son?
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:10.239]  No.
[01:19:11.439 --> 01:19:12.899]  I just said no.
[01:19:13.119 --> 01:19:13.619]  I just answered.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:18.699]  Hunter Biden is now the first son of a sitting US president to be convicted of a crime.
[01:19:18.859 --> 01:19:20.840]  I'm extremely proud of my son Hunter.
[01:19:21.199 --> 01:19:22.920]  He has overcome an addiction.
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:27.119]  He's one of the The greatest, most decent man I know.
[01:19:27.859 --> 01:19:32.619]  And I am satisfied that I'm not going to do anything I said.
[01:19:32.619 --> 01:19:34.100]  I abide by the jury decision.
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:36.699]  I will do that and I will not pardon him.
[01:19:36.779 --> 01:19:40.239]  Does the president have any intention of pardoning him?
[01:19:40.439 --> 01:19:42.260]  We've been asked that question multiple times.
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.079]  Our answer stands, which is no.
[01:19:45.279 --> 01:19:46.159]  It's still a no.
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:46.960]  It's still a no.
[01:19:47.979 --> 01:19:48.899]  It's still a no.
[01:19:49.039 --> 01:19:49.899]  It will be a no.
[01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:51.000]  It is a no.
[01:19:51.119 --> 01:19:52.800]  And I don't have anything else to add.
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:54.180]  Will he pardon his son?
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:54.579]  No.
[01:19:55.279 --> 01:19:59.380]  Will you accept the jury's outcome, their verdict, no matter what it is?
[01:19:59.619 --> 01:19:59.939]  Yes.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.619]  And have you ruled out a pardon for your son?
[01:20:03.079 --> 01:20:03.380]  Yes.
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:07.119]  President Biden says that he's not gonna pardon his son, Hunter.
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.300]  Is he gonna ask Donald Trump to do that?
[01:20:09.939 --> 01:20:11.859]  I don't have anything else to share about that.
[01:20:11.979 --> 01:20:14.180]  I'm not gonna go down a rabbit hole on this.
[01:20:14.319 --> 01:20:17.220]  I've been very clear, the president's been very clear when we've been asked this question.
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:22.399]  And is there any world in which President Biden would consider pardoning the former president?
[01:20:22.579 --> 01:20:23.819]  I'm just not gonna speak to that.
[01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:24.640]  No comment.
[01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:35.109]  We have a piece of crack cocaine no bigger than this quarter that I'm holding in my hand.
[01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:36.829]  One quarter of one dollar.
[01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:41.550]  We passed a law through the leadership of Senator Thurman and myself and others.
[01:20:41.829 --> 01:20:44.470]  A law that says you're caught with that.
[01:20:44.649 --> 01:20:48.989]  You go to jail for five years.
[01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:51.329]  You get no probation.
[01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:56.960]  You get Nothing other than five years in jail.
[01:20:57.239 --> 01:20:59.039]  Judge doesn't have a choice.
[01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:05.680]  Under our forfeiture statutes, you can, the government can, take everything you own.
[01:21:06.319 --> 01:21:18.619]  Everything from your car to your house, your bank account, not merely what they confiscate in terms of the dollars from the transaction that you just got caught engaging in.
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:19.840]  They can take everything.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.359]  I don't care why they become a sociopath.
[01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:27.560]  We have an obligation to cordon them off from the rest of society.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.239]  They are in jail.
[01:21:30.859 --> 01:21:35.199]  Away from my mother, your husband, our families.
[01:21:35.779 --> 01:21:39.460]  So I don't want to ask, what made them do this?
[01:21:39.699 --> 01:21:42.680]  They must be taken off the street.
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:46.560]  Alright, we're going to go to break in 50 seconds.
[01:21:47.359 --> 01:21:49.039]  And I am going to...
[01:21:50.829 --> 01:21:57.909]  Break down the enemy's response to what Trump is doing and what we should expect from the bad guys.
[01:21:58.670 --> 01:22:03.789]  And then some of the latest crime sprees by the illegal aliens running around thumbing at the mouth.
[01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:10.949]  Because many of them came here dumped out of prisons, expressly told from places like Venezuela to come here and have a free-for-all.
[01:22:11.930 --> 01:22:14.350]  Someone hit that, how the enemy's going to respond.
[01:22:15.649 --> 01:22:21.869]  This is key information that is vital to defeating the New World Order.
[01:22:22.050 --> 01:22:24.430]  We have the enemy plan.
[01:22:24.430 --> 01:22:31.229]  I know the enemy plan before they even give the orders to their operatives.
[01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:35.489]  I am inside the enemy's brain right now.
[01:22:35.789 --> 01:22:36.970]  Stay with us.
[01:22:37.819 --> 01:22:41.279]  Well, the winner, Chris DiLaro, is here in studio from New Jersey.
[01:22:41.319 --> 01:22:45.199]  Former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[01:22:45.199 --> 01:22:46.319]  What an amazing aircraft.
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:50.680]  This is one of the pinnacles of my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there.
[01:22:50.739 --> 01:22:52.899]  Just being in this studio, I never imagined I'd be.
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:53.880]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[01:22:53.939 --> 01:22:54.560]  You're the reason we're here.
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:55.460]  I can't wait.
[01:22:55.949 --> 01:22:58.130]  To learn who the next winner is.
[01:22:58.310 --> 01:23:00.729]  And even though they shut out InfoWars, the Alex Jones Network continues on.
[01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:02.890]  TheAlexJonesTour.com is not owned by me.
[01:23:03.050 --> 01:23:07.109]  So we now know it's the Democratic Party and the biggest gun control group that was behind all the fake lawsuits.
[01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.829]  We already knew that.
[01:23:07.949 --> 01:23:09.170]  But now they've bragged about it.
[01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:14.390]  Whether these people are successful or not, and I believe they won't be, we're going to continue on to the Alex Jones Network.
[01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:18.449]  And so this baby is a new promotion and I will be...
[01:23:18.930 --> 01:23:26.810]  Delivering this bad boy and $10,000 cash to you, from myself and the entire Infowars family and the Alk Shows Network family.
[01:23:26.989 --> 01:23:28.430]  You are our family.
[01:23:28.710 --> 01:23:29.890]  God bless you all.
[01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:33.109]  Now go to thealkshowstore.com and get entered to win this bad boy.
[01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:34.970]  Please stand by for further details.
[01:23:34.970 --> 01:23:37.329]  We return you now to your regularly scheduled program.
[01:23:37.609 --> 01:23:39.189]  Oh my gosh, I don't know.
[01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:40.409]  This is insane.
[01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:43.729]  We're an hour and a half into this powerful transmission.
[01:23:45.569 --> 01:23:54.489]  I've got two and a half hours left here, and I'm going to continue just rampaging through the news, but a 600-page report just dropped.
[01:23:55.810 --> 01:24:07.609]  During the four-minute break, I just read the first few pages of it, and man, if I was happy earlier, right now I am having a mental orgasm.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.079]  I mean, seriously, I'm having trouble even doing the show at this point.
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:27.220]  I'm gonna have to cover this later, though, because I need to scan through it some more before I get to it.
[01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:29.460]  I mean, we already know everything in it, but...
[01:24:32.050 --> 01:24:33.850]  Because we already know this up one side and down the other.
[01:24:33.970 --> 01:24:40.329]  But this is a big step towards putting Bill Gates and Fauci and Peter Daszak and the rest of them in prison if they're lucky.
[01:24:41.329 --> 01:24:46.489]  And there's a video of Bill Gates being chased through the streets of England, screaming at him that he's a tyrant, murdering everybody with a shot.
[01:24:46.609 --> 01:24:47.189]  So I got that video.
[01:24:47.609 --> 01:24:50.569]  I mean, this is, ooh boy, the synopsis pages alone.
[01:24:51.829 --> 01:24:52.689]  What do they call that?
[01:24:52.729 --> 01:24:53.390]  The glossary?
[01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.949]  The syllabus?
[01:24:54.250 --> 01:24:56.489]  The, uh...
[01:24:56.489 --> 01:24:57.250]  Mmm.
[01:24:58.529 --> 01:24:59.189]  Ha ha ha ha.
[01:25:00.079 --> 01:25:01.260]  Oh, this doesn't look good.
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:02.079]  Here, let me tell you.
[01:25:03.119 --> 01:25:05.340]  You guys thought you were going to get away with all this.
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:06.880]  Doesn't look like you are to me.
[01:25:07.859 --> 01:25:09.680]  No, in fact, you're not getting away with it.
[01:25:09.739 --> 01:25:10.819]  You haven't gotten away with it.
[01:25:10.979 --> 01:25:21.420]  And just what's been done to you so far in the information war is starts the big capital D. Devastating.
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:25.699]  That's devastating.
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:35.130]  So, Oh my gosh.
[01:25:35.369 --> 01:25:38.449]  Oh, goody, goody gumdrops.
[01:25:40.489 --> 01:25:41.890]  Stay on target.
[01:25:42.930 --> 01:25:44.250]  Stay on target.
[01:25:45.609 --> 01:25:45.649]  Okay.
[01:25:49.670 --> 01:25:51.550]  Okay, control yourself.
[01:25:52.810 --> 01:25:54.470]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:25:57.619 --> 01:25:58.939]  Oh my gosh.
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:04.100]  This calls for a drink of delicious cold spring water.
[01:26:09.899 --> 01:26:10.479]  Refreshing.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:15.840]  Stop it.
[01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:21.539]  Seriously, I'm having an endorphin kick right now.
[01:26:23.190 --> 01:26:25.949]  My cells, my very cells are like, good job.
[01:26:26.130 --> 01:26:26.810]  Oh, yes.
[01:26:29.529 --> 01:26:32.369]  Excuse me.
[01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:37.510]  Yeah, I can't continue the show at this point.
[01:26:40.050 --> 01:26:41.050]  Just need a moment here.
[01:26:41.210 --> 01:26:41.529]  Excuse me.
[01:26:46.029 --> 01:26:51.310]  All right.
[01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:59.810]  Boy, do I have a lot of stuff to cover here.
[01:27:01.069 --> 01:27:03.229]  I don't know how anybody could ever claim there's a slow news day.
[01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:03.909]  It's the opposite.
[01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:20.890]  I'm like a guy that loves steak, and there's like a hundred perfectly cooked, delicious, mouth-watering ribeyes, porterhouses, New York strips sizzling in front of me,
[01:27:21.029 --> 01:27:21.970]  ready to be gobbled.
[01:27:22.859 --> 01:27:26.000]  But at the end of the day, I'm like, wow, how am I going to eat all this?
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:28.600]  Because I really, you know, I just want to eat one.
[01:27:28.779 --> 01:27:32.819]  I want to eat like a 25-ounce ribeye or maybe a 30-ounce porterhouse.
[01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:38.020]  And I, because, you know, this is all coffin nails in the water.
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:41.380]  This is what it looks like when they are in free fall collapse.
[01:27:41.939 --> 01:27:45.819]  But at the same time, I did pretty good.
[01:27:45.819 --> 01:27:49.359]  I took a few deep breaths at the start of the show, I told you, and I did a good job.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:51.020]  But this is hard.
[01:27:51.319 --> 01:27:52.000]  I'm trying.
[01:27:54.819 --> 01:27:57.119]  Because I'm not going to just cover the surface of these things.
[01:28:07.739 --> 01:28:08.779]  Let me tell you something.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:24.079]  When the Senate puts out a report like that, it makes the top of my head a blow-off because that's just another giant flamethrower signal that there's a total civil war within the power structures of the planet.
[01:28:25.359 --> 01:28:33.079]  And there's a lot of corrupt people, obviously, because a lot of people were just asleep, and now they realize how much danger everybody's in by the main group, the main establishment.
[01:28:33.619 --> 01:28:49.140]  And so humanity is like a truck stuck in the mud, and you finally start to get traction, and you're coming out of it, and you get that moment where you know you've made it out, and you're still...
[01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:53.590]  Moving slow, every second you move faster.
[01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:54.989]  I mean, that's where we are.
[01:28:55.329 --> 01:28:59.510]  And so it's like a giant weight is being lifted off of me.
[01:28:59.510 --> 01:29:06.189]  And it doesn't mean we're out of the woods, but man, I mean, I've had this weight on me for at least 35 years.
[01:29:06.329 --> 01:29:09.029]  A mission just burning in my bones like Ezekiel talks about.
[01:29:09.109 --> 01:29:09.869]  I mean, burning.
[01:29:10.029 --> 01:29:11.050]  I'm burning right now.
[01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:11.649]  Burning.
[01:29:13.149 --> 01:29:13.550]  And...
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:24.659]  I've got dozens and dozens of big reports here that are just devastating.
[01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:29.760]  But then I start thinking, oh my God, the enemy is going to pull out all the stops.
[01:29:30.359 --> 01:29:33.060]  So then I'm like, whoa, I've got to expose that.
[01:29:33.619 --> 01:29:34.720]  You've got to expose that.
[01:29:34.779 --> 01:29:36.359]  We've got to get this information out to everybody.
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:42.000]  I mean, this is epic, historic stuff going on right now.
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:43.520]  I mean, this is amazing.
[01:29:49.939 --> 01:29:51.880]  By the way, I'm not doing this to be dramatic right now.
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:58.039]  I'm still got such a big adrenaline, endorphin rush.
[01:29:59.359 --> 01:30:07.760]  I would imagine if Star Wars was real, you know, when they're, see the Death Star blow up, 10 seconds before they get blown up, imagine, I think you'd kind of get a little high for a minute.
[01:30:08.239 --> 01:30:10.199]  I mean, this is like, Death Stars, Death Stars!
[01:30:13.110 --> 01:30:16.590]  And then I start thinking, extrapolating out what that means, and I'm just like, oh!
[01:30:18.529 --> 01:30:18.890]  So...
[01:30:18.890 --> 01:30:22.369]  Oh, my goodness.
[01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:26.109]  Oh, God is so good.
[01:30:26.250 --> 01:30:26.729]  Thank you, Lord.
[01:30:28.050 --> 01:30:29.729]  Oh, please, God, protect the children.
[01:30:29.909 --> 01:30:31.350]  Please, please, please, please.
[01:30:32.770 --> 01:30:33.630]  Oh, my goodness.
[01:30:40.159 --> 01:30:58.329]  And also what I'm doing is usually I look at the stack and I already have this big database of info I want to go over and then now I just got off into this high as a kite thing and I'm only on coffee and water and haven't even eaten today and I'm not a hard drug user,
[01:30:58.350 --> 01:30:59.350]  I guess I can't really say.
[01:31:01.069 --> 01:31:02.130]  I'm high right now.
[01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:03.649]  High on life.
[01:31:03.869 --> 01:31:04.710]  High on victory.
[01:31:05.409 --> 01:31:07.489]  High on the excitement of being a man in the arena.
[01:31:07.930 --> 01:31:09.489]  Engaged with all these other men and women in the arena.
[01:31:09.989 --> 01:31:10.729]  Battling tyranny.
[01:31:10.890 --> 01:31:11.409]  It's so epic.
[01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:12.130]  It's so delicious.
[01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:12.930]  It's so fulfilling.
[01:31:13.109 --> 01:31:13.750]  It's so real.
[01:31:13.930 --> 01:31:15.449]  It's so what we need to be.
[01:31:16.789 --> 01:31:17.149]  Oh!
[01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:19.369]  Oh, thank you, God.
[01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:20.170]  I just want to thank God.
[01:31:22.529 --> 01:31:23.689]  I want to pray right now to God.
[01:31:23.829 --> 01:31:26.890]  I just can't even do it because I'm just already praying right now to God.
[01:31:27.050 --> 01:31:27.710]  That's what's happening.
[01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:37.010]  Okay, let me get control of myself here.
[01:31:39.130 --> 01:31:40.329]  It's information overload.
[01:31:40.489 --> 01:31:43.829]  See, I was totally ready for the next attack, the next...
[01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:47.300]  Three stacks that all tie together.
[01:31:47.479 --> 01:31:49.939]  They all tie together, but these really tie together in a particular area.
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:54.819]  And then I went to break and started reading this, and I just was like...
[01:31:54.819 --> 01:31:57.520]  All right.
[01:31:57.899 --> 01:31:59.079]  Let me just do this.
[01:32:09.539 --> 01:32:10.000]  Yeah.
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:11.060]  Yeah, that's...
[01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:12.220]  That's good.
[01:32:13.079 --> 01:32:14.880]  Let's play Trump calls for...
[01:32:15.850 --> 01:32:17.170]  Execution of human traffickers.
[01:32:17.329 --> 01:32:24.189]  And then now, his administration says they're going to investigate and prosecute government officials that ran it with the UN, that were in charge of it.
[01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:29.270]  And Holman's very grave when he's looking at the camera saying that, because he's not stupid.
[01:32:29.529 --> 01:32:39.250]  He understands that if we don't win, he just signed his death warrant, just like I have committed, and just like many of you have committed to this fight.
[01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:43.829]  So, we are facing the real heart of the war now.
[01:32:44.649 --> 01:32:45.090]  But...
[01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:47.300]  I don't have a good feeling.
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.779]  I know we're going to win.
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:50.000]  It's going to be hard.
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:50.880]  It's not going to be pretty.
[01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:53.640]  For some of us, it's not going to be enjoyable.
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:08.260]  Enjoyable at the moment sometimes, but very fulfilling, empowering, enriching, completing, completing, completion.
[01:33:09.239 --> 01:33:10.739]  It's beyond satisfaction.
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:23.140]  It's I guess in the Zen term, encompassing all of time and space in the purity and perfection of God.
[01:33:25.399 --> 01:33:26.739]  Oneness with God.
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:46.399]  I am not one with God yet, but I can feel the approach of I can get a little inkling, which is the most powerful feeling you'll ever feel.
[01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:49.119]  So enriching.
[01:33:50.399 --> 01:33:53.699]  Every cell in your body crying out for it.
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:56.960]  Wanting it to go back to the source.
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:02.020]  Back into the embrace of the almighty.
[01:34:03.279 --> 01:34:04.300]  There's Trump.
[01:34:05.630 --> 01:34:17.989]  I was thrilled to host a screening at Bedminster of the important new film, Sound of Freedom, about the power of faith in overcoming evil, and in particular, the evil of child trafficking.
[01:34:17.989 --> 01:34:18.810]  Big problem.
[01:34:19.050 --> 01:34:24.890]  We had it down to the lowest number in many years, just four years ago, and now it's gone through the roof.
[01:34:25.319 --> 01:34:34.199]  Even though the fake news media has tried to ignore it, Sound of Freedom has been a national sensation and a colossal success at the box office.
[01:34:34.399 --> 01:34:35.380]  Really big numbers.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:37.020]  Everyone should see it.
[01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:44.840]  This is a very important film and very important movie and it's a very important documentary all wrapped up in one.
[01:34:45.489 --> 01:34:49.550]  It's really about an issue that has to be discussed.
[01:34:49.810 --> 01:34:57.630]  Under my leadership, we did more than any administration in history to combat human trafficking and to end modern-day slavery.
[01:34:57.949 --> 01:35:13.229]  In one of my first acts in office, I signed an executive order targeting I signed the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act,
[01:35:13.369 --> 01:35:18.670]  authorizing $430 million to fight sex and labor trafficking.
[01:35:18.930 --> 01:35:27.869]  I signed legislation to crack down on foreign countries who are not meeting standards for eliminating trafficking, of which there are many.
[01:35:28.090 --> 01:35:39.029]  I also signed into law the Abolish Human Trafficking Act, Which strengthened programs supporting survivors and provided more resources for ending modern slavery.
[01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:41.909]  We do have modern slavery, if you can believe it.
[01:35:42.130 --> 01:35:47.949]  Additionally, I created the first ever White House position focused solely on combating human trafficking.
[01:35:48.289 --> 01:35:53.329]  And perhaps most importantly, we created the most secure border in US history by far.
[01:35:53.869 --> 01:35:57.229]  Dealing a major blow to the cartels and traffickers.
[01:35:57.409 --> 01:35:59.750]  We built hundreds of miles of wall.
[01:35:59.949 --> 01:36:03.010]  We renovated hundreds of miles of wall.
[01:36:03.170 --> 01:36:05.090]  We never had anything like it.
[01:36:05.229 --> 01:36:13.069]  And then I got Mexico free of charge to give us 28,000 soldiers to protect us from people coming into our country illegally.
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:22.319]  When I am back in the White House, I will immediately end the Biden border nightmare that traffickers are using to exploit vulnerable women and children.
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:24.579]  We will fully secure the border.
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:32.960]  I will wage war on the cartels just as I destroyed the ISIS caliphate, 100% gone, 100% destroyed.
[01:36:33.239 --> 01:36:35.960]  They'll come back now because we have a weak administration.
[01:36:36.529 --> 01:36:45.649]  I will use Title 42 to end the child trafficking crisis by returning all trafficked children to their families in their home countries and without delay.
[01:36:45.989 --> 01:37:00.079]  And I will urge Congress to ensure that anyone caught trafficking children across our border Receives the death penalty immediately, and that includes also for women, because women, as you know, are number one in trafficking.
[01:37:00.479 --> 01:37:02.100]  Children are actually number two.
[01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:10.539]  I want to thank Eduardo, Jim, Tim Ballard, and everyone else involved in this film for their incredible efforts and their great genius.
[01:37:10.899 --> 01:37:16.699]  Together, we will end the scourge of human trafficking, and we will defend the dignity of human life.
[01:37:16.859 --> 01:37:17.739]  Thank you very much.
[01:37:21.249 --> 01:37:25.770]  Agenda 47 president calls for death penalty for human traffickers.
[01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:30.489]  And now his incoming administration has pledged to target the administration officials.
[01:37:31.989 --> 01:37:34.050]  You don't need to fill in the blank.
[01:37:38.029 --> 01:37:38.949]  All right.
[01:37:39.810 --> 01:37:42.329]  So how are the bad guys going to strike back?
[01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:57.970]  Senator Blumenthal, one of the nastiest of the nasties, quarterbacking operations against Infowars, and yours truly, look it up, with the Justice Department and the CIA and their little buddies in Connecticut.
[01:37:58.430 --> 01:38:00.170]  Their little buddies.
[01:38:00.909 --> 01:38:21.520]  They introduced legislation eight months ago That would strip the executive branch, the president, the chief executive, of the power to command the U.S. military forces.
[01:38:26.039 --> 01:38:30.239]  Oh, look, Senator Blumenthal calls the onions acquiring him for war sweet justice.
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:31.220]  Oh, really?
[01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:33.739]  The judge said again last week, did not happen, it was a fraud.
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:37.859]  Nothing out of Blumenthal.
[01:38:38.119 --> 01:38:40.279]  Stolen valor, Blumenthal.
[01:38:42.239 --> 01:38:44.039]  Disgraced, Blumenthal.
[01:38:44.539 --> 01:38:46.520]  Disgusting, Blumenthal.
[01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:49.739]  Evil, pathetic, Blumenthal.
[01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:53.159]  Enemy of humanity, Blumenthal.
[01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:56.640]  Scourge on the earth, Blumenthal.
[01:38:57.260 --> 01:38:58.819]  The anathema creature.
[01:38:59.859 --> 01:39:03.859]  The servant of the devil, Blumenthal.
[01:39:06.239 --> 01:39:07.720]  And a few other names he deserves.
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:10.600]  Look at that guy.
[01:39:13.859 --> 01:39:15.079]  Da Nang Dick.
[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:15.960]  Yeah, that's his name.
[01:39:16.819 --> 01:39:17.960]  Combat veteran of Vietnam.
[01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:18.680]  Never out of country.
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:22.260]  He ran the Toys for Tots program at the Capitol.
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:23.579]  Oh, yeah.
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:26.439]  Always helping the children.
[01:39:26.779 --> 01:39:28.699]  Always close to the children.
[01:39:30.579 --> 01:39:33.579]  So, what are these guys going to do?
[01:39:36.409 --> 01:40:06.600]  Well, that's a pretty big constitutional crisis to introduce a bill that's just sitting there like a shark hunting seals to strip Trump of the military war powers And defense of the National Guard in America.
[01:40:07.619 --> 01:40:10.760]  That is a legislative coup against the executive.
[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:13.420]  Completely unconstitutional.
[01:40:14.819 --> 01:40:16.100]  And it's been waiting.
[01:40:16.279 --> 01:40:20.039]  And they said, well, if Trump wins, we know there'll be uprisings because he's Hitler.
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:29.880]  And we can't allow him to be a dictator, which he's not.
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:30.439]  He's elected.
[01:40:31.930 --> 01:40:33.229]  And he has a job to do.
[01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:49.930]  And so they've said when he rounds up the illegals, the human traffickers, all of them, and when there's these uprisings that mayors and governors and Sean Penn and all of them have called for, California governor, Massachusetts governor, New York,
[01:40:50.010 --> 01:41:00.449]  all of them, they're going to call for citizens, as they've been doing, to uprise and physically battle I'll show you some more headlines in a moment.
[01:41:00.989 --> 01:41:16.810]  The feds, who are doing a constitutional court-ordered duty, and then obviously they'll stage a false flag against some of the illegal aliens and say, look, Trump's Hitler, and then when they order the left to burn down the cities, in the blue cities they still control the police standing down,
[01:41:17.069 --> 01:41:34.560]  they will then say he's a dictator, and when he tries to call out the National Guard, They think they'll create a constitutional crisis and have the Congress strip him.
[01:41:35.239 --> 01:41:42.199]  Now, they didn't win the election, but they do have some rhinos working for him, as you know.
[01:41:42.699 --> 01:41:44.199]  And so they could get that done.
[01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:46.619]  But we're exposing it beforehand.
[01:41:46.619 --> 01:41:50.880]  Now, I know you've heard me cover this probably a couple hundred times as a regular listener.
[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:54.199]  The difference is we're now in the future...
[01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:58.329]  We're now, what, 48 days?
[01:41:58.489 --> 01:41:58.989]  How many is it?
[01:41:59.090 --> 01:42:00.090]  To his inauguration.
[01:42:00.489 --> 01:42:02.329]  And so here's NBC News.
[01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:04.130]  AP Reuters are all reporting it today.
[01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:12.189]  Democrat senators urge Biden to try to limit Trump's ability to use the U.S. military domestically.
[01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:31.520]  And they have that on CNN at the Pentagon's meeting and preparing to not follow illegal orders for the National Guard or the military to aid ICE. Now,
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:35.680]  I already did a whole hour on this last week, but we've had lawyers on to agree with me.
[01:42:35.779 --> 01:42:42.199]  It's a fact that, and you look at what Eisenhower did and other presidents, he could call out the regular army.
[01:42:42.279 --> 01:42:43.279]  He could call the Marines out.
[01:42:43.399 --> 01:42:44.279]  They have before.
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:51.760]  But no, it's just going to be the feds and a lot of jurisdictions that are going to help them.
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:53.180]  It's a federal duty.
[01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:54.140]  It's constitutional.
[01:42:54.439 --> 01:42:56.119]  One of the three main duties of the federal government.
[01:42:56.239 --> 01:42:57.180]  It's in the damn Constitution.
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:57.819]  Go look it up.
[01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:03.029]  The Declaration of Independence is all about controlling illegal aliens.
[01:43:03.250 --> 01:43:03.850]  Go read it.
[01:43:05.029 --> 01:43:06.649]  I mean, that's July 4th, folks.
[01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:07.289]  Heard of that day?
[01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:09.930]  That was one of their biggest beefs.
[01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:12.470]  It wasn't about a 3% tea tax.
[01:43:12.569 --> 01:43:14.470]  That was just one thing they went after as an example.
[01:43:18.890 --> 01:43:27.270]  They are already pre-positioning this that if he tries to do anything during civil unrest, they are preparing that he's a tyrant.
[01:43:28.939 --> 01:43:34.739]  Two Democrat senators are urging, see, they want Biden to get behind it before Trump leaves to make it look legitimate.
[01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:37.699]  Here, Biden, go along with us taking your constitutional power away.
[01:43:38.699 --> 01:43:50.880]  Two Democrat senators are urging the Biden administration to issue a policy directive that could temporarily limit President-elect Trump's ability to deploy U.S. military troops domestically after he takes office.
[01:43:51.439 --> 01:43:52.060]  Mm-hmm.
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:58.779]  Putting handcuffs on before they blow the country up, burn the country down, but it's mostly peaceful, so don't worry.
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:16.960]  Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat Massachusetts, and Richard Blumenthal, Democrat Connecticut, both members of the Armed Services Committee, sent a letter dated November 26 to President Joe Biden, the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that's being fired, that urged them to issue a policy directive that would ensure that U.S. troops,
[01:44:17.119 --> 01:44:28.409]  oh, not from the President, no, no, Lloyd Austin's the President, Can be used only when local or state authorities ask for federal help or are unable or unwilling to protect the public.
[01:44:29.569 --> 01:44:31.350]  What'd you see with defund the police and the rest of it?
[01:44:32.649 --> 01:44:37.430]  They're going to have Democrat governors, Newsom's already said this, even secede.
[01:44:37.510 --> 01:44:40.850]  And by the way, I talked, I didn't break this last week because I wanted to make some more calls.
[01:44:41.789 --> 01:44:49.430]  I talked to some folks in Silicon Valley that are well-placed and they told me specifically about mayors and city councils that they've been in the meetings with.
[01:44:51.449 --> 01:44:58.670]  That have been in the meetings with Newsom, where they are planning to basically have California secede.
[01:44:58.810 --> 01:45:01.750]  They won't call it that, but that's what it'll be in the fine print.
[01:45:04.590 --> 01:45:19.569]  Remember what, in 2020, in the New York Times, right before the election, they had that big war game article of how to contest the election, saying we won't accept a Trump win, we'll have our own inauguration, and we'll have Democrat states break off.
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:26.500]  So, that was their plan then if Trump overrode the fraud, which he didn't.
[01:45:27.039 --> 01:45:30.399]  And so they're going right back to their public plan then, now.
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:38.800]  That's how I've known for months and [...] months this was coming and that we should understand that and that Trump needs to what?
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:41.979]  Get ahead of it.
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:44.859]  Yeah, that's the Time Magazine when I forget the New York Times.
[01:45:46.079 --> 01:45:55.890]  Type in John Podesta war-gamed Not accepting a Trump win in 2020. And it was the Democrat Party, DNC officially.
[01:45:56.710 --> 01:45:58.109]  It has an innocuous headline.
[01:45:58.250 --> 01:45:59.050]  It's like a huge article.
[01:45:59.270 --> 01:46:04.090]  But when you read into it, in the article it says right there that they weren't gonna...
[01:46:04.090 --> 01:46:07.149]  John Podesta proposes alternate inauguration.
[01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.829]  Stuff like that.
[01:46:07.989 --> 01:46:08.810]  That'll pull it up.
[01:46:10.529 --> 01:46:12.170]  So this has been their plan.
[01:46:12.170 --> 01:46:13.109]  It is the plan.
[01:46:13.449 --> 01:46:16.770]  And again, how do you make Trump look illegitimate?
[01:46:17.050 --> 01:46:19.270]  Well, you gotta kill a bunch of Democrats.
[01:46:20.939 --> 01:46:27.979]  And they've mainly been programming that, you know, oh, the white supremacists are going to blow up all the power stations, and then they keep provocateuring it, the FBI does.
[01:46:28.119 --> 01:46:30.000]  And oh, they're going to kill migrants.
[01:46:30.119 --> 01:46:44.079]  So you either have some lunatics you wind up and pay to do it, or the globalists do it, or some Merck group does it, and then you blame Trump supporters, and then you have the left and the counties and cities and states they control just burn everything down.
[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:51.020]  And then when Trump rightfully has the military go in, like they did in the L.A. riots in the early 90s.
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:53.159]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:57.600]  Democrats' war game for election includes West Coast secession, possible civil war.
[01:46:57.779 --> 01:47:01.100]  Yeah, that's the Breitbart article, and then it links to the New York Times.
[01:47:01.239 --> 01:47:02.319]  Good, good, good, good, good, good.
[01:47:02.659 --> 01:47:03.619]  Oh, you found it.
[01:47:03.659 --> 01:47:03.960]  There it is.
[01:47:04.359 --> 01:47:06.460]  How the media could get the election wrong.
[01:47:07.529 --> 01:47:11.590]  Why we may now not know the results for days or even weeks.
[01:47:12.189 --> 01:47:15.229]  So it's time to rethink election night.
[01:47:16.109 --> 01:47:17.489]  Print me that.
[01:47:17.729 --> 01:47:19.590]  And then in that article, everything I said is there.
[01:47:21.489 --> 01:47:22.470]  Good job, crew.
[01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:26.670]  So it's kind of a big deal, right?
[01:47:27.149 --> 01:47:29.109]  Yeah, it's the enemy counter-strike plan.
[01:47:29.210 --> 01:47:29.829]  We have it.
[01:47:29.989 --> 01:47:32.930]  They think we're so stupid that they openly prepare it.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:39.319]  And then they have all the pre-preparation, and now they're hyping up the final preparation for it right now.
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:43.500]  With an overlay of a cyber attack, they claim the Russians did to knock out the power in certain areas.
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:45.159]  Yep.
[01:47:46.739 --> 01:47:48.380]  Are we going to let them do this?
[01:47:48.619 --> 01:47:49.420]  Stay with us.
[01:47:50.279 --> 01:47:57.720]  Well, the winner, Chris DiLaro, is here in studio from New Jersey, former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:47:58.840]  What an amazing aircraft.
[01:47:59.079 --> 01:48:00.500]  Chris, I got to say, man, we love you.
[01:48:00.579 --> 01:48:01.319]  Thanks for the support.
[01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:02.840]  I love you, Alex.
[01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:05.100]  I love Bigley, Nate, Colin.
[01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:05.760]  Thanks, Chris.
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:10.920]  This is one of the pinnacles in my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there, just being in this studio.
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:12.100]  I never imagined I'd be.
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:13.060]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:13.760]  You're the reason we're here.
[01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:16.319]  It's so cool how cool the listeners are.
[01:48:16.399 --> 01:48:16.800]  It is.
[01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:17.279]  Yes.
[01:48:17.479 --> 01:48:17.979]  Wow, thank you.
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:19.279]  The listeners are amazing.
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:25.279]  Like, everyone that goes to the Alex Jones store, obviously you're in it to win this truck, but this experience of coming on the show, how is this, Chris?
[01:48:25.439 --> 01:48:29.119]  I mean, is this not, this is like a, it's a dream, I would feel like, for the winner, right?
[01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:40.560]  Fortunately, I slept pretty good last night, but it's been very stressful because he said, Colin said, you're going on the show, and I was like, I'm a little camera shy, but here I am.
[01:48:40.699 --> 01:48:41.840]  And I've done well, old Vader.
[01:48:42.859 --> 01:48:45.220]  I said, I'll do whatever I need to do to help Alex and Big Lee.
[01:48:45.859 --> 01:48:47.060]  Well, I'm glad I got to meet you.
[01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:48.899]  We're going to eat some barbecue from Terry Black's here in a minute.
[01:48:49.199 --> 01:48:50.619]  Am I starting to mouthwater when you said that?
[01:48:50.779 --> 01:48:51.239]  No, I'm starving.
[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:55.359]  Now, real quick, this is all done by a computer, by a professional company.
[01:48:55.579 --> 01:48:56.699]  I was talking to you guys before.
[01:48:57.260 --> 01:48:58.600]  Sometimes it's in the middle of it.
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:48:59.439]  Sometimes it's at the end.
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:00.439]  Sometimes it's at the start.
[01:49:01.199 --> 01:49:03.619]  Have you seen where somebody who entered on the first day won?
[01:49:03.939 --> 01:49:09.619]  You know, honestly, we've done probably 30 of these giveaways and have never seen someone win on the very first day.
[01:49:09.859 --> 01:49:15.460]  But we have these multipliers that, you know, go into place, you know, maybe at the first week in the last week of the giveaway, right?
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:18.779]  And during these multipliers, if you spend, you know, $10, you get 100 entries.
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:20.859]  If you spend $100, you get 1000 entries, right?
[01:49:20.979 --> 01:49:23.539]  It's a 10x multiplier for when you enter during that time period.
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:26.399]  You actually enter during the 10x time period, right?
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:29.380]  And at the end of the giveaway, we run the 10x time period as well.
[01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:31.899]  So it was one of the best times to enter to win.
[01:49:32.199 --> 01:49:34.939]  And, I mean, you got, you know, more entries for how much you spent.
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:36.479]  With the new contest, where are we right now?
[01:49:36.659 --> 01:49:39.920]  It's a brand new Ford F-250 Super Duty trimmer.
[01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:40.520]  It's sick.
[01:49:40.659 --> 01:49:41.920]  It's all black, jacked up.
[01:49:42.079 --> 01:49:43.880]  It's Alex Jones verified for sure.
[01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:45.100]  He picked the wheels.
[01:49:45.239 --> 01:49:45.960]  He picked the tires.
[01:49:46.199 --> 01:49:46.979]  It looks good.
[01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:47.359]  I don't know.
[01:49:47.479 --> 01:49:48.500]  Yeah, we're showing it right here.
[01:49:48.739 --> 01:49:51.399]  It also comes with $10,000 in cash as well.
[01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:52.399]  Chris, do you have that on you?
[01:49:52.539 --> 01:49:54.100]  Yeah, this is not a hoax, people.
[01:49:54.510 --> 01:50:02.689]  He is the winner of all the thousands of folks that came to thealexjonesstore.com and got products to be entered to win or just put your email in for free and you're entered to win.
[01:50:02.850 --> 01:50:07.149]  He bought two t-shirts, ladies and gentlemen, and he won this incredible super truck.
[01:50:07.250 --> 01:50:08.289]  Somebody can be like Chris.
[01:50:08.409 --> 01:50:09.970]  They can go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:50:09.989 --> 01:50:22.029]  They can order the great CMOS, order any of the great supplements, t-shirts, hats, whatever, and you're entered to win a badass, brand new F-250 trimmer, fully loaded pickup truck, and you get $10,000 in cash, and we fly you down here.
[01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:23.000]  You get to meet Alex.
[01:50:23.119 --> 01:50:23.800]  You get to be on the show.
[01:50:23.939 --> 01:50:26.300]  If you just enter your email, you're still entered to win.
[01:50:26.479 --> 01:50:28.279]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:50:28.399 --> 01:50:29.020]  Enter your email.
[01:50:29.359 --> 01:50:30.380]  Join the VIP club.
[01:50:30.579 --> 01:50:33.739]  I promise you next week what you'll get for being in the VIP club.
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:35.000]  You'll be very excited.
[01:50:35.199 --> 01:50:39.579]  I knew folks would love the last truck, and I know you'll love this truck as well.
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:42.579]  Another incredible pickup truck.
[01:50:42.939 --> 01:50:45.439]  Super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[01:50:45.619 --> 01:50:46.579]  It's a beautiful truck.
[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:52.520]  Super high ratings and you get $10,000 in cash on top of it for the lucky winner.
[01:50:52.939 --> 01:51:09.920]  A 2024 Ford F-250 Super Duty Diesel Tremor Edition, 6.7 liter high output power stroke diesel engine with 500 horsepower and 1,200 lb-ft per torque, 2-inch ready lift kit, 37-inch Toyo off-road tires,
[01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:16.479]  20-inch black Rhino wheels, 12-inch touchscreen with 360-degree cameras to see all around the truck.
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:18.380]  Well, it's a kick-ass truck.
[01:51:18.579 --> 01:51:20.779]  I'm sorry to see it go, but it's going to a great guy, Chris.
[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:22.119]  Chris, love you, brother.
[01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:22.880]  Love you, man.
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:23.239]  Thank you.
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:25.640]  Somebody's about to get this sweetheart right here.
[01:51:26.159 --> 01:51:29.079]  And listen, they said I could drive it while I was down here for the last month and a half.
[01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:30.060]  I only drove it once.
[01:51:30.439 --> 01:51:31.380]  Things are too nice.
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:33.579]  The winners are going to get these pristine trucks.
[01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:36.279]  So, we'll see you at thealexhillstour.com, and thanks for all your support.
[01:51:48.150 --> 01:51:51.670]  If you just joined us, a lot of stations don't carry this first five minutes.
[01:51:51.810 --> 01:52:09.210]  That's why I tend to still cover important information in the first five, but I need the full audience of 400 plus radio stations to hear this because obviously I already knew this was important when I was just covering last segment,
[01:52:09.630 --> 01:52:25.560]  but rereading it and looking at it again, I haven't dropped the ball, but I have dropped the ball.
[01:52:27.439 --> 01:52:35.579]  Like, we've done the best job, my guests, myself, the crew, exposing what the deep state's planning to do once Trump gets in way ahead of time.
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:39.800]  And then now we're living in exactly what I predicted.
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:42.000]  It's not hard to predict because they said what they would do.
[01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:42.939]  In fact, it's not even a prediction.
[01:52:45.119 --> 01:52:47.579]  And I'm sitting here reading this.
[01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:59.510]  And they're going to do this as soon as Trump gets in.
[01:53:00.090 --> 01:53:02.409]  Or they might try to kill him again before then.
[01:53:02.529 --> 01:53:04.329]  But I'm just...
[01:53:04.329 --> 01:53:07.270]  I get really happy about all the positive things happening.
[01:53:07.329 --> 01:53:09.350]  I actually get euphoric, which I don't normally do.
[01:53:09.489 --> 01:53:11.949]  Because this has been a long fight and such good stuff's happening.
[01:53:12.829 --> 01:53:16.289]  But at the same time, they're not going to give up.
[01:53:18.829 --> 01:53:20.670]  They got the World War III thing going on.
[01:53:20.970 --> 01:53:26.609]  They've got the pre-programming of with no evidence the Russians are going to turn the lights out with a cyber attack.
[01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:30.010]  Well, they explain that they're going to create the Civil War.
[01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:34.649]  They got all their Civil War movies and crap out there.
[01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:36.609]  This is just stunning.
[01:53:39.850 --> 01:53:49.199]  So, I'm going to come back and I'm going to get to all of this In great detail.
[01:53:51.539 --> 01:53:54.060]  And we'll also get more into that LABO report.
[01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:58.319]  Yeah, we should get out of the UN. That's what Trump did.
[01:53:58.819 --> 01:54:00.779]  Trump got us out of the UN migration pact.
[01:54:01.539 --> 01:54:02.319]  UNESCO garbage.
[01:54:02.579 --> 01:54:02.939]  All of it.
[01:54:04.039 --> 01:54:05.319]  And so, 100%.
[01:54:05.319 --> 01:54:07.880]  And then you've got to go up to the child trafficking because that brings the whole thing down.
[01:54:07.979 --> 01:54:09.640]  But I need to get into this more.
[01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:17.180]  Because it just hit me while I was sitting here reading the articles that This is it.
[01:54:17.340 --> 01:54:17.800]  Stay with us.
[01:54:18.619 --> 01:54:22.119]  Well, we are in the middle of the danger zone.
[01:54:24.460 --> 01:54:32.119]  I am your host, Alexander Emmerich Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, from the embattled InfoWars News Studios.
[01:54:34.819 --> 01:54:35.579]  All right.
[01:54:38.359 --> 01:54:46.430]  I've done a good job in the last two hours and seven minutes in covering The epic developments.
[01:54:47.529 --> 01:54:54.689]  Now, I've got my work cut out for me to cut in live here all of these clips and this news.
[01:54:54.689 --> 01:54:57.470]  I've got to at least hit the surface of these babies.
[01:54:57.890 --> 01:55:01.470]  I mean, the U.S. Government Weather Control Office?
[01:55:01.670 --> 01:55:02.829]  Just come on.
[01:55:03.310 --> 01:55:06.270]  I mean, these developments are all just a quickening.
[01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:07.149]  It's frantic.
[01:55:07.149 --> 01:55:07.909]  It's faster.
[01:55:09.369 --> 01:55:11.890]  It's crescendos triggering things.
[01:55:13.090 --> 01:55:15.270]  Finales that trigger mega finales.
[01:55:15.449 --> 01:55:16.289]  I mean, it's just...
[01:55:16.289 --> 01:55:18.569]  It's wild.
[01:55:21.250 --> 01:55:22.470]  Massive developments.
[01:55:23.210 --> 01:55:45.329]  But I just ended the last hour with CNN, ABC News, NBC News, Politico, Atlantic Monthly, all of them running around Saying,
[01:55:45.329 --> 01:55:56.109]  as you heard in the weeks before the election, with no evidence out of the clear blue sky, Trump is going to kill the migrants and kill the black people.
[01:55:56.270 --> 01:55:58.430]  We need an armed uprising to stop him.
[01:56:00.270 --> 01:56:01.590]  Civil war conditions.
[01:56:02.010 --> 01:56:02.909]  Jamie Raskin.
[01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:04.369]  James Carville.
[01:56:05.069 --> 01:56:05.930]  John Podeska.
[01:56:07.409 --> 01:56:10.470]  And they said if they couldn't steal it in 2020...
[01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:34.020]  They were going to have a civil war and not accept his election and then have Democrat states break off and create a new country and then organize those segments to then have a military-civil war and that in the scenario the U.S. military would join them,
[01:56:34.779 --> 01:56:39.579]  they mean they control the leadership, to then remove Trump.
[01:56:39.739 --> 01:56:41.659]  Now that was four years ago.
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:48.100]  Two years ago, they started production of an almost $400 million movie that came out this year.
[01:56:52.039 --> 01:56:57.039]  And idiots were like, even conservatives were like, we don't know what the plot is.
[01:56:57.279 --> 01:57:00.359]  It doesn't say if the government's right wing or left wing.
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:03.460]  What type of moron would you have to be?
[01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:10.220]  And I did a review of Civil War, but I should watch it again and write notes into it.
[01:57:10.479 --> 01:57:11.899]  Well, hell, it's completely out now.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:12.600]  I can show the clips.
[01:57:12.699 --> 01:57:14.659]  In fact, I'm going to do a report on it in the next 48 hours.
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:28.560]  It's white people working for a Trump presidency in the future, going around murdering migrants and black people, and so the rest of the country...
[01:57:32.180 --> 01:57:41.979]  The Western Alliance, which is the globalist and the anti-Western, so it's a perfect name, march on D.C. and they kill the president and the Secret Service.
[01:57:44.979 --> 01:58:05.529]  Now, in the real world, Podesta and the Democrats' war game two months before the 2020 election, that exact scenario, so when they stole it from Trump and thought he could never come back, they still produced a movie that Fantasizing about what they would do or taking out a future president like him.
[01:58:05.909 --> 01:58:09.010]  But instead, they got the exact same president back now.
[01:58:13.789 --> 01:58:19.310]  So, you know, there's these evil white towns that aren't playing along that don't have all the crime and poverty.
[01:58:19.449 --> 01:58:19.970]  How dare them?
[01:58:20.090 --> 01:58:21.130]  And they've got to be dealt with, too.
[01:58:22.479 --> 01:58:28.819]  And all this murder porn where the Latin American armies that are with the US military slaughter the evil white people.
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.920]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:39.079]  And then the Black Alliance female officer executes Donald Trump.
[01:58:43.979 --> 01:58:45.640]  And then you've got this.
[01:58:46.479 --> 01:58:51.140]  Democrat senators urge Biden to try to limit Trump's ability to use the US military.
[01:58:52.350 --> 01:59:07.010]  They ask the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to do what's already been reported on weeks ago, to prepare the military to not follow Trump's orders, which include having the National Guard stop violent burning of the nation.
[01:59:07.989 --> 01:59:09.329]  Already covered that last hour.
[01:59:09.550 --> 01:59:14.710]  Now, I mentioned these key articles, and the crew dug them up quickly on the fly.
[01:59:15.670 --> 01:59:17.630]  Here's the Breitbart that boils it down.
[01:59:17.869 --> 01:59:28.890]  Democrats' war game, that's a quote, they call it a war game, for a war, for election includes West Coast secession, possible civil war.
[01:59:30.529 --> 01:59:41.619]  That's August 2020. Here's the actual article, and there's a bunch of others.
[01:59:41.779 --> 01:59:44.539]  How the media could get the election story wrong.
[01:59:44.699 --> 02:00:04.880]  This is where they talk about the military siding with the Democrat states, having their own inauguration, declaring that they're their own government to try to legitimize the Civil War, and then launching a physical U.S. military, now under globalist control, attack on Trump.
[02:00:14.910 --> 02:00:18.470]  So, they are, here's the analogy.
[02:00:18.710 --> 02:00:27.229]  You know, let's say you got a store-bought frozen lasagna in the refrigerator and mom doesn't want to cook dinner that night.
[02:00:27.369 --> 02:00:27.710]  She's tired.
[02:00:27.829 --> 02:00:28.250]  Dad's tired.
[02:00:28.430 --> 02:00:32.189]  So, she makes a salad and throws the lasagna in the oven.
[02:00:35.039 --> 02:00:42.100]  The lasagna was already taken out of the freezer four years ago and then put back in when they stole the election.
[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:49.119]  Then a few months ago, really about eight months ago, they took it out of the refrigerator freezer again and stuck it in the oven.
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:01:00.020]  So now the lasagna has come out of the oven, is on the kitchen counter, and they are slicing it up into squares, preparing to put it on plates.
[02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:02.319]  That's how close we are to civil war.
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:03.659]  It's totally staged.
[02:01:04.670 --> 02:01:16.890]  And again, there'll be racial attacks on illegal aliens, just like the movie Civil War as the pretext, and the Democrats are everywhere saying, it's imminent, Trump's going to kill the illegal aliens.
[02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:20.050]  Now, obviously Trump wouldn't do that.
[02:01:20.130 --> 02:01:20.569]  It's wrong.
[02:01:20.569 --> 02:01:21.310]  He doesn't want to do that.
[02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:22.869]  It would destroy his credibility.
[02:01:22.989 --> 02:01:24.270]  That is preposterous.
[02:01:24.329 --> 02:01:28.090]  No, they're going to stage the mass killing of the migrants.
[02:01:29.869 --> 02:01:33.229]  That is not even 2 plus 2 equals 4. That is...
[02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:35.229]  It's lasagna.
[02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:36.289]  You can read the box.
[02:01:37.770 --> 02:01:38.829]  It's put in the oven.
[02:01:39.010 --> 02:01:39.729]  It's pulled out.
[02:01:40.029 --> 02:01:41.909]  It's 400 degrees.
[02:01:41.909 --> 02:01:45.350]  It's cooked for 30 minutes, an hour, whatever.
[02:01:45.670 --> 02:01:57.189]  And they're slicing it up and they've got it on the spatula, putting it on the plate right now.
[02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:04.279]  So, we don't want this dish to get served.
[02:02:05.899 --> 02:02:20.920]  So, I need everybody to take the live show feed right now, and once this is archived in the next few hours, on Alex Jones and Bandot Video, I need you to take this, just like you did with the General Flynn interview on November 7th,
[02:02:21.039 --> 02:02:37.899]  with that headline, just one version got 15.6 million views, All together, different clips of it, over 35 million views on Exxon that I saw, and I know the president saw it, and I know that it got them to already focus on what they already knew,
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:42.239]  and that you've seen them come out now and say, no, we are going to go after the administration.
[02:02:42.699 --> 02:02:45.819]  We are going to put them in jail for the crimes they committed, because they already know that.
[02:02:46.479 --> 02:02:47.039]  Do it.
[02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:49.760]  Because they've already launched their attacks.
[02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:51.140]  We already know what they're going to do.
[02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:52.359]  Just get it out in the open.
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:53.199]  Now.
[02:02:54.489 --> 02:02:58.369]  You counter them by saying you're a bunch of child trafficking pedophiles.
[02:02:59.430 --> 02:03:03.050]  You start marching the victims up as they're already doing at press conferences at the border.
[02:03:05.010 --> 02:03:09.949]  And you get ahead of their operation before they kill a bunch of migrants.
[02:03:13.229 --> 02:03:14.409]  And then that's happening.
[02:03:14.590 --> 02:03:15.710]  So that's good.
[02:03:15.989 --> 02:03:23.149]  So we don't want just 5, 10, 20 million viewers for what I just said in the last few hours.
[02:03:24.510 --> 02:03:28.010]  We're going to cut this up into more digestible pieces.
[02:03:29.210 --> 02:03:45.649]  And then we're going to post it at Real Alex Jones on X. And then if you want to stop these people and have your electricity and water running and not have World War III and not have total globalist leftists cut off the resources and plunge the country into third world hellscape forever...
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:04:03.319]  You're gonna take these reports about this right now, and you're going to share it, and we're gonna reach 30, 40, 50 million people, and then they're gonna reach more people, and we're gonna stop the globalists dead in their tracks.
[02:04:05.119 --> 02:04:12.279]  See, we've reached a point now in America and the world where a large portion of people, a majority, are somewhat awake.
[02:04:12.279 --> 02:04:15.439]  A huge minority are super awake and active.
[02:04:16.689 --> 02:04:24.850]  And since we're not naive anymore, people are listening and people in government and corporations are listening and they're going, yeah, that's all true.
[02:04:25.010 --> 02:04:26.470]  Yeah, because I just showed you where they said it.
[02:04:26.729 --> 02:04:26.930]  Okay?
[02:04:27.170 --> 02:04:28.149]  So this isn't hard.
[02:04:29.189 --> 02:04:30.329]  It's crazy.
[02:04:30.850 --> 02:04:44.449]  It's hard to deal with it, but isn't it better if something, you know, like nobody wants a fire in their house, but if you wake up and smell smoke and, you know, there's a fire in the heater or whatever and you grab the, you know, it's fire extinguisher and you put it out.
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:51.659]  Admitting the problem meant the whole house didn't burn down.
[02:04:52.460 --> 02:04:54.560]  And maybe you and your wife and kids get killed.
[02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:56.500]  I mean, you know, oh, I smell smoke.
[02:04:56.579 --> 02:04:57.979]  Well, I just choose to ignore that.
[02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:00.939]  No, you jump up at the fire extinguisher and go put the son of a bitch out.
[02:05:01.079 --> 02:05:04.100]  And if it's so bad you can't put it out, you grab your family and you get the hell out of the house.
[02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:08.760]  So, that's another analogy.
[02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:10.760]  I mean, we got a fire in the furnace here.
[02:05:11.439 --> 02:05:12.880]  Flames are shooting out to the ceiling.
[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:14.760]  And we got...
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:18.300]  A minute to get to the fire extinguisher and put it out.
[02:05:22.460 --> 02:05:25.500]  Because you don't want to be in the position where the fire gets out of control.
[02:05:28.100 --> 02:05:29.500]  And then the whole house burns down.
[02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:43.140]  And then we got to talk about, if we do got, I mean, I mean, you will, if the commies take over, you'll, they're going to get a civil war, all right.
[02:05:44.929 --> 02:05:46.670]  Does anybody really want that?
[02:05:46.789 --> 02:05:47.649]  I know some of you do.
[02:05:47.789 --> 02:05:48.890]  I don't think you really thought it through.
[02:05:49.390 --> 02:05:50.649]  Yeah, we'll win.
[02:05:52.949 --> 02:05:54.869]  But do you have any idea what they're going to do during that?
[02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:56.729]  They're going to release bio-weapons.
[02:05:57.050 --> 02:05:58.529]  They're going to cut the power.
[02:05:58.949 --> 02:06:00.649]  They're going to starve people to death.
[02:06:02.810 --> 02:06:09.789]  And if some governors and others rally immediately and put a stop to it and just don't follow the globalist orders...
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:17.000]  We'll be able to get the power on in a week or two, and then we'll have to get the military and march on their ass.
[02:06:18.380 --> 02:06:19.640]  But I don't want that.
[02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:24.119]  I know some people will think it's going to be cathartic and all this other stuff.
[02:06:25.359 --> 02:06:29.319]  99% of the people we're going to be fighting in this scenario don't know what's going on.
[02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:36.720]  There's nothing cathartic about killing, in a civil war, a bunch of dumbasses.
[02:06:37.979 --> 02:06:39.520]  You want to help the dumbasses.
[02:06:39.760 --> 02:06:41.300]  You want to inform the dumbasses.
[02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:47.380]  You want to be the smart people that are engaged now so this doesn't happen.
[02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:52.779]  So we are in grave danger.
[02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:55.199]  At least more people are awake.
[02:06:55.399 --> 02:06:57.079]  We're gaining control of the country.
[02:06:58.500 --> 02:07:00.739]  But this is what they're planning.
[02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:04.640]  And so it's not my opinion.
[02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:06.880]  They've said this is what they're doing.
[02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:26.060]  And by the grace of the almighty God, working through viewers and folks like you, supporting the transmission, we're still on air exposing this and reaching more people than ever.
[02:07:26.239 --> 02:07:28.479]  Thanks again to you sharing the information.
[02:07:29.319 --> 02:07:35.520]  All right, let me stop there and I want to get into more of this and then tie it into the censorship and the rats leaving the sinking ship.
[02:07:35.899 --> 02:07:37.560]  I'm going to then hurry through a bunch more of this.
[02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:42.819]  But I just realized that I get so busy and so focused.
[02:07:43.060 --> 02:07:45.760]  I did a little two-minute plug at the end of the first hour.
[02:07:46.380 --> 02:07:51.140]  Didn't plug or promote anything in the second hour.
[02:07:51.300 --> 02:07:57.100]  And now I'm 20 minutes in to this hour and have not mid-air refueled.
[02:07:57.180 --> 02:07:58.619]  And you're the refuelers in the war.
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.119]  I make it easy.
[02:08:00.300 --> 02:08:00.880]  Great supplements.
[02:08:01.039 --> 02:08:01.819]  Great Patriot Greer.
[02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:02.439]  Great products.
[02:08:02.539 --> 02:08:06.060]  TheAlexinStore.com We have the Black Friday sales.
[02:08:07.369 --> 02:08:17.250]  They go through this week, extended, and hundreds and hundreds of t-shirt, hoodie, and ball cap designs.
[02:08:17.550 --> 02:08:18.970]  I mean, there's like three or four new ones a day.
[02:08:19.069 --> 02:08:19.909]  It's all made in Arkansas.
[02:08:21.729 --> 02:08:23.449]  So many people are supporting.
[02:08:23.609 --> 02:08:24.810]  I want to thank you all for that.
[02:08:24.949 --> 02:08:25.750]  So many of you haven't.
[02:08:25.890 --> 02:08:27.869]  Folks, these are the best Christmas sweaters.
[02:08:28.409 --> 02:08:29.789]  These are the best hoodies.
[02:08:30.649 --> 02:08:31.489]  Limited edition.
[02:08:32.850 --> 02:08:33.829]  It just goes on and on.
[02:08:33.930 --> 02:08:35.750]  I want to thank all the viewers and listeners that have supported.
[02:08:35.829 --> 02:08:36.970]  I want to encourage everybody else.
[02:08:37.409 --> 02:08:39.909]  The bad guys want this broadcast off the air.
[02:08:40.449 --> 02:08:42.270]  You want our HydroForce.
[02:08:42.390 --> 02:08:45.029]  You want Ultimate CMOS. You want our probiotic.
[02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:46.069]  You want our gut cleanse.
[02:08:46.210 --> 02:08:48.350]  You want our energy gummies and our sleep gummies.
[02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:54.130]  They're all private labeled from top brands at the highest quality at very competitive prices.
[02:08:54.329 --> 02:08:56.270]  Right now with these sales, ridiculous prices.
[02:08:57.829 --> 02:08:58.670]  That's the paradox.
[02:08:58.829 --> 02:09:01.649]  A lot of money comes in, but only a slice of it's money to fund things.
[02:09:02.399 --> 02:09:05.479]  Right now, three shirts or three hats, 40% off.
[02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:07.819]  Two hoodies, 35% off.
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:09.699]  Ultimate supplement bundle, 30% off.
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:16.380]  On top of the already discounts, VIP members always get $40 a month to spend in the store for your $30 as a membership.
[02:09:16.579 --> 02:09:19.300]  So if you're going to be buying products, you make money that way.
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:28.239]  But you're also getting $30 to $50, depending on the gift, Free gifts emailed to you to claim your free gift when you're a VIP member.
[02:09:28.359 --> 02:09:31.260]  So everybody that's going to support should become a VIP member.
[02:09:31.359 --> 02:09:32.920]  Then you get special offers, special discounts.
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:37.560]  It reminds you you're a member so that you can support and get that $40 to spend in the store each month.
[02:09:38.739 --> 02:09:39.880]  You enjoy the supplements.
[02:09:39.899 --> 02:09:40.979]  You see how great they are.
[02:09:41.319 --> 02:09:43.880]  And you continue to be a VIP. We want to keep you happy.
[02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:46.600]  We want a relationship, a civilization with you.
[02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:50.859]  So please...
[02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:53.649]  The information's hardcore.
[02:09:53.890 --> 02:09:54.789]  The bad guys hate it.
[02:09:55.170 --> 02:09:56.850]  Why don't you try the products?
[02:09:57.869 --> 02:10:01.829]  Product-wise, they're just as good as their information.
[02:10:02.409 --> 02:10:04.289]  Friends and family, take the supplements.
[02:10:05.170 --> 02:10:05.970]  Supplements are huge.
[02:10:06.109 --> 02:10:10.090]  Everybody knows how great things that God gave us are, but they're not all created equal.
[02:10:10.770 --> 02:10:11.829]  I mean, take turmeric.
[02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:16.149]  Most turmeric is 4% raw.
[02:10:16.609 --> 02:10:21.010]  The turmeric we sell is 95% of humanoid, the strongest out there.
[02:10:21.109 --> 02:10:21.829]  It's just a concentrate.
[02:10:22.029 --> 02:10:22.510]  Why not?
[02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:26.649]  My wife, you know, plays a lot of sports and stuff, tennis, you name it.
[02:10:26.710 --> 02:10:28.909]  She's like, man, you know, I take these big turmeric horse pills.
[02:10:29.010 --> 02:10:30.229]  They help some for hip pain.
[02:10:31.529 --> 02:10:32.949]  And her ankle pain from playing tennis.
[02:10:34.090 --> 02:10:36.189]  And I'm like, just take these.
[02:10:36.329 --> 02:10:37.609]  She goes, no, I already take these big, big ones.
[02:10:37.710 --> 02:10:39.250]  And I said, take these.
[02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:41.609]  She goes, I started like eating four horse pills.
[02:10:42.109 --> 02:10:44.010]  She says, yeah, I take like four of them, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:46.130]  And I said, honey, this is raw turmeric.
[02:10:47.090 --> 02:10:47.989]  I said, take this.
[02:10:48.409 --> 02:10:50.550]  A couple days later, she goes, that works way better.
[02:10:50.689 --> 02:10:54.109]  And it's, it's, why is it, it's just, these are smaller capsules.
[02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:55.149]  I said, it's concentrated.
[02:10:56.510 --> 02:10:59.590]  It's 95, see the back, 95% curcuminoid.
[02:11:02.159 --> 02:11:03.039]  And it's the same.
[02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:03.979]  The sea moss.
[02:11:04.119 --> 02:11:05.079]  Yeah, raw sea moss.
[02:11:05.199 --> 02:11:06.079]  Irish sea moss is great.
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:10.720]  Key vitamins, key minerals, the way God grows it, the way it just naturally has it.
[02:11:10.859 --> 02:11:11.819]  The iodine's the best.
[02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:15.600]  Raw sea moss is great.
[02:11:15.779 --> 02:11:17.439]  And a lot of the brands are just raw sea moss.
[02:11:17.560 --> 02:11:24.779]  This is the equivalent of 40 grams per serving, two capsules, of Irish sea moss in a serving.
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.100]  40 grams is a lot.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.779]  And that's just one of the ingredients in it.
[02:11:38.929 --> 02:11:41.550]  Burdock, root, the bladder, rack.
[02:11:42.130 --> 02:11:44.149]  Not pretty names, but powerful.
[02:11:44.590 --> 02:11:46.329]  They all go together synergistically.
[02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:47.670]  You want to take it.
[02:11:47.770 --> 02:11:49.390]  You want to experience it.
[02:11:50.750 --> 02:11:58.210]  And you go become a member, $30 a month, and then you get $10 extra, $40, and you get your...
[02:12:00.420 --> 02:12:01.300]  Seamoss every month.
[02:12:01.899 --> 02:12:03.819]  And then you check out the t-shirts and the knives.
[02:12:03.979 --> 02:12:05.000]  A bunch of new products are getting added.
[02:12:05.359 --> 02:12:07.779]  And you come back and that's...
[02:12:07.779 --> 02:12:08.340]  Wow.
[02:12:09.439 --> 02:12:20.439]  You know, Jeff Bezos is working with Bill Gates to inject a mutinogenic compound into all the cows where they don't produce methane anymore.
[02:12:21.159 --> 02:12:22.420]  So that'll, quote, save the earth.
[02:12:22.439 --> 02:12:24.359]  Of course, it screws up their guts and screws up the meat.
[02:12:25.340 --> 02:12:26.760]  Why are you supporting him?
[02:12:30.250 --> 02:12:37.430]  If you start shopping with the patriots, if you start shopping with people that are fighting the tyrants, you will build the new economy.
[02:12:37.529 --> 02:12:38.529]  They're so scared of that.
[02:12:39.810 --> 02:12:43.649]  Separately, then I'm going to go into more news here and get into it all.
[02:12:44.569 --> 02:12:45.710]  And I want to cover it.
[02:12:45.770 --> 02:12:47.149]  It's just so much.
[02:12:49.470 --> 02:12:51.850]  Because I refuse to just cover the surface.
[02:12:53.170 --> 02:12:54.930]  But that's better than not covering it.
[02:12:57.409 --> 02:12:59.329]  So I got a job in front of me when we come back.
[02:13:00.149 --> 02:13:00.770]  But it's important.
[02:13:01.590 --> 02:13:02.909]  And the bad guys don't like it.
[02:13:03.029 --> 02:13:03.909]  So I'm going to do it.
[02:13:04.810 --> 02:13:06.609]  Separately, my dad's great supplement company.
[02:13:08.729 --> 02:13:09.550]  DrJonesNaturals.com.
[02:13:09.630 --> 02:13:10.710]  Whatever happens to Infowars.
[02:13:11.109 --> 02:13:12.029]  TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:13:12.550 --> 02:13:13.210]  TheArJonesNaturals.com.
[02:13:13.350 --> 02:13:14.090]  Not owned by me.
[02:13:14.850 --> 02:13:16.149]  They can't get our sponsors.
[02:13:16.350 --> 02:13:17.729]  They can't shut down our sponsors.
[02:13:17.869 --> 02:13:19.109]  That means they can't shut me down.
[02:13:19.289 --> 02:13:20.229]  They shut this down.
[02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:21.229]  There's a hearing.
[02:13:21.369 --> 02:13:22.590]  The evidentiary hearing is next Monday.
[02:13:22.850 --> 02:13:24.789]  The bad guys are refusing their depositions.
[02:13:24.909 --> 02:13:26.689]  The judge ordered, so I don't know if that'll even be on.
[02:13:27.989 --> 02:13:28.630]  Oh, yeah.
[02:13:29.350 --> 02:13:31.630]  They're not acting too happy over there.
[02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:35.029]  What you scared of?
[02:13:36.569 --> 02:13:40.069]  But it takes money to do all this and fight back, so there you go.
[02:13:41.310 --> 02:13:43.189]  drjonesnaggles.com, powering the resistance.
[02:13:44.260 --> 02:13:55.159]  The concentrated fibergreens are all the key known seed sprouts that just have the super compounds in them that are so good for your energy, your stamina, your veto, your immune system, your gut health.
[02:13:56.060 --> 02:13:57.039]  It's global foundational energy.
[02:13:57.079 --> 02:13:58.079]  It's not a stimulant.
[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:01.239]  But it's so strong, I really shouldn't take it.
[02:14:01.319 --> 02:14:05.819]  I took some yesterday and I was bouncing off the walls because it doesn't have a letdown because it's not a stimulant.
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:19.020]  It just feels like one because it's the concentrate, the breakdown of The equivalent of something like five pounds of spinach in a dose of folic acid.
[02:14:19.180 --> 02:14:21.199]  But most people can't break down folic acid properly.
[02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:27.439]  So it's the breakdown of that methylfolate with a key organic B-complex.
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:28.859]  Ooh, baby!
[02:14:29.579 --> 02:14:31.600]  You think Popeye's strong eating that spinach?
[02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:32.220]  Try this.
[02:14:32.819 --> 02:14:35.859]  But if you already got a temper like me, look out.
[02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:37.119]  I mean, seriously.
[02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:39.319]  People get these problems and go, wow, you're not kidding me.
[02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:40.399]  Yeah, look out.
[02:14:42.090 --> 02:14:43.569]  Next level of foundational energy.
[02:14:46.130 --> 02:14:53.689]  Everything at drjonesnaturals.com is at least 30% off up to 50% off when you get CoQ10, ProLiposomal, and Corsetin Max.
[02:14:54.210 --> 02:14:57.130]  I don't have to tell you about Corsetin and CoQ10.
[02:14:57.229 --> 02:15:00.909]  These are high quality concentrate of it at very low prices.
[02:15:00.930 --> 02:15:04.270]  You're not going to find Corsetin and CoQ10 anywhere near these prices.
[02:15:04.550 --> 02:15:09.109]  Get them together for 50% individually, 40% at drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:15:10.510 --> 02:15:13.130]  There's also some great challenge coins, don't tread on me.
[02:15:14.210 --> 02:15:20.489]  And when treason becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.
[02:15:21.529 --> 02:15:23.869]  Those are as low as $9 to $14 a piece.
[02:15:23.989 --> 02:15:28.270]  They're heavy, they're beautiful, they're nice, they're great conversation pieces, great stocking stuffers, great gifts.
[02:15:30.029 --> 02:15:37.149]  Thealexjonesstore.com and drjonesnatorials.com Okay, I'm done.
[02:15:39.079 --> 02:15:42.000]  But we won't be here if it's not for you supporting us, so thank you.
[02:15:42.359 --> 02:15:43.640]  Folks that do support, you know you are.
[02:15:43.699 --> 02:15:48.060]  You are the few, the proud, the core of the core of the resistance.
[02:15:48.079 --> 02:15:49.079]  And this is a war.
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:52.319]  We're all veterans of a bioweapon attack in the New World Order.
[02:15:52.420 --> 02:15:54.779]  I mean, we're under total globalist psychological attack.
[02:15:55.039 --> 02:15:55.659]  But guess what?
[02:15:55.720 --> 02:15:56.260]  We're aware of it.
[02:15:56.319 --> 02:15:56.840]  We're not giving up.
[02:15:56.920 --> 02:15:57.600]  And we're getting stronger.
[02:15:57.659 --> 02:15:58.539]  They're getting weaker.
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:15:59.960]  Just like lifting weights.
[02:16:01.149 --> 02:16:03.770]  That which does not kill us only makes us stronger.
[02:16:04.930 --> 02:16:06.170]  Massive news straight ahead.
[02:16:06.369 --> 02:16:07.069]  Stay with us.
[02:16:07.409 --> 02:16:12.510]  I'm here to tell you, brother, Donald Trump's gonna save this country and nothing's gonna stop it.
[02:16:13.390 --> 02:16:17.069]  I only lost 30-something pounds, 33, 40 pounds.
[02:16:17.250 --> 02:16:19.890]  I'm going down another 20 or 30, so I'll actually be in shape soon.
[02:16:20.029 --> 02:16:20.789]  I'm still not in shape.
[02:16:21.630 --> 02:16:23.090]  Alex, how are you doing that?
[02:16:23.229 --> 02:16:24.170]  Don't tell me eating right.
[02:16:24.250 --> 02:16:24.869]  I'm not gonna buy that.
[02:16:25.740 --> 02:16:28.520]  Well, I mean, I'm not taking Ozempic, if that's what you ask.
[02:16:30.659 --> 02:16:33.239]  Nick is a big Ozempic fan.
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:39.340]  I did it all from the AlexJonesStore.com with Ultimate Seamoss, the ultimate seafood.
[02:16:39.540 --> 02:16:40.280]  That's why, right here.
[02:16:40.979 --> 02:16:46.120]  This is the Ozempic of vitamins, the superfood.
[02:16:46.239 --> 02:16:47.899]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:49.840]  The Ozempic of the sea.
[02:16:52.559 --> 02:16:56.520]  It's got the best iodine and all these weird minerals and vitamins that are only in the sea moss.
[02:16:56.639 --> 02:16:59.819]  And I am doing a plug here, because, you know, we could be shut down next Tuesday.
[02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:06.620]  InfoWars is up for sale next Tuesday, forced by the court, but we'll continue on in the air one way or another, working with great folks.
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:13.879]  Rising from the ashes of censorship, it's Alex Jones.
[02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:19.680]  All of us together are gonna lift the curse off of this country, and we're gonna send the globalists to prison!
[02:17:20.799 --> 02:17:23.879]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:17:24.159 --> 02:17:27.680]  First they come for Alex Jones, and then they're gonna come for us.
[02:17:27.799 --> 02:17:31.100]  And they try to bankrupt Alex Jones or try to put Alex Jones in prison.
[02:17:31.239 --> 02:17:38.059]  The demonization of Alex Jones should be of profound interest to everybody all across the board, even progressives.
[02:17:38.260 --> 02:17:39.760]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:17:39.940 --> 02:17:42.879]  Alex Jones taught me about this shit 20 years ago.
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:43.559]  Listen!
[02:17:43.860 --> 02:17:49.479]  I don't know how all this is gonna end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one!
[02:17:56.040 --> 02:18:00.739]  The Alex Jones Network is tomorrow's news today.
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:09.040]  All right, so the Democrats have officially said they're going to trigger civil unrest.
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:15.959]  They're going to obviously stage some false flags to make Trump look like a demon to try to legitimize that.
[02:18:16.239 --> 02:18:19.479]  The good news is they're badly coordinated.
[02:18:19.479 --> 02:18:25.950]  We know what they're trying and Most of their minions and operatives aren't even following orders at this point.
[02:18:26.909 --> 02:18:30.229]  Zuckerberg is completely capitulated and rolled over, at least on the surface.
[02:18:30.989 --> 02:18:33.329]  Jeff Bezos is thrown in the towel publicly.
[02:18:34.389 --> 02:18:38.569]  Whether that's on the surface or not, that signifies a lot.
[02:18:39.350 --> 02:18:41.209]  Their people are rolling over everywhere.
[02:18:41.770 --> 02:18:44.030]  It's not just happening here, it's happening all over the world.
[02:18:44.370 --> 02:18:46.889]  I mean, we have the initiative.
[02:18:48.399 --> 02:19:06.180]  But if we're naive about this and if Trump and his people don't talk about it and say, well, that's a funny plan you've got for civil unrest and then claim I'm a dictator when we follow our duty and stop it, you better watch it.
[02:19:06.260 --> 02:19:07.719]  That's a crime you're talking about.
[02:19:07.860 --> 02:19:12.899]  Just like they told these governors and these mayors that we're going to physically confront you.
[02:19:13.020 --> 02:19:14.139]  We're going to come after you.
[02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:24.149]  And Then they tried to say, oh, actually, no, we're not, because Homan said, well, that's a crime, we'll just arrest you.
[02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:28.969]  I mean, that's a real insurrection right there.
[02:19:29.409 --> 02:19:33.389]  Oh, you're going to come with judge's orders and deport human traffickers and drug dealers?
[02:19:33.729 --> 02:19:36.729]  Oh, we're going to meet you at the county line and fight you physically.
[02:19:37.590 --> 02:19:39.110]  Okay, we're going to arrest you for that.
[02:19:39.250 --> 02:19:39.950]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:19:41.309 --> 02:19:45.209]  Actually, let me walk that back, the mayor of Denver and others said.
[02:19:45.469 --> 02:19:48.190]  But others are shooting their mouths off, so let me just hit this, I'll get to the other news.
[02:19:49.739 --> 02:19:54.479]  Democrats' mayors say they will use police to obstruct Trump's deportation of illegals.
[02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:56.799]  Big Zero Hedge article.
[02:19:57.219 --> 02:20:01.219]  And a whole bunch of these Democrats saying they're going to do that.
[02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:08.799]  Remember, the Democrats only went in these states with no voter ID. This is a good boil down of them openly talking about it.
[02:20:08.840 --> 02:20:14.260]  So the sanctuary cities will again expand basically their secession from America.
[02:20:15.969 --> 02:20:23.370]  Continuing, security guard, there's hundreds of these today, arrested for allegedly molesting children staying at New York City's shelter for illegals.
[02:20:24.930 --> 02:20:25.829]  Here's another one.
[02:20:26.670 --> 02:20:32.969]  Nearly 60,000 criminal migrants now call New York City home with serious criminal records like rape, robbery, murder.
[02:20:34.389 --> 02:20:35.209]  This is nuts.
[02:20:35.610 --> 02:20:42.010]  U.S. taxpayers paying government of Pakistan hundreds of millions of dollars to house migrants in New York City.
[02:20:42.569 --> 02:20:43.989]  You can't make this up.
[02:20:44.149 --> 02:20:46.110]  These reports have videos, documents, everything.
[02:20:47.069 --> 02:20:52.750]  Germany, Green Party politician leads fight against 130 migrants for Bavarian village and only 280 residents.
[02:20:52.909 --> 02:20:57.069]  So even the left's claiming they're against open borders now in total panic mode.
[02:20:57.170 --> 02:21:04.430]  And you saw Starmer admit to replacement migration and that it's all, you know, a UN globalist operation and that it's a part of a plan and that he's against it.
[02:21:04.829 --> 02:21:08.590]  That's like a fox being caught with a chicken in his mouth saying he's against eating chickens.
[02:21:09.930 --> 02:21:21.000]  Muslim member of parliament demands blasphemy laws in the UK. Mexican illegal arrested for torching mobile home killing two people in Phoenix.
[02:21:23.319 --> 02:21:25.079]  Just stack after stack of that.
[02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:26.959]  Okay, let me get to some really huge news here.
[02:21:30.059 --> 02:21:43.180]  Trump Saturday came out with this news and this is one of those stories that has so many levels to it, so many layers to it.
[02:21:44.100 --> 02:21:47.040]  But this is what people need to know about Trump.
[02:21:49.420 --> 02:21:53.639]  When people claim he works for the Russians, or people...
[02:21:53.639 --> 02:21:55.200]  It's ridiculous.
[02:21:56.459 --> 02:22:01.780]  Trump is a classical Americana supporter.
[02:22:03.260 --> 02:22:07.659]  And what made the country great was tariffs and made us the biggest exporter in the world.
[02:22:08.379 --> 02:22:16.780]  You've seen what letting China and other countries buy their slave labor and cheap energy, the equivalent of massive tariffs on our goods, that we...
[02:22:17.870 --> 02:22:19.649]  I've seen our industrial base destroyed.
[02:22:21.010 --> 02:22:24.389]  And then now they're shutting down our energy base and our farming base.
[02:22:24.649 --> 02:22:29.010]  And John Kerry, you know, the climate envoy, we need to get rid of most farming or half the farming.
[02:22:29.290 --> 02:22:31.430]  If we don't cut off the farming, people will starve.
[02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:32.030]  That's a quote.
[02:22:33.469 --> 02:22:34.329]  I'm not kidding.
[02:22:34.909 --> 02:22:38.709]  John Kerry says, reduce farming or people will starve.
[02:22:39.329 --> 02:22:41.430]  And then when everybody starves, oh, look, it's global warming.
[02:22:42.809 --> 02:23:10.959]  So when Trump came out and said, and I'll read his statement in a moment, We're not ending dollar dominance, dollar hegemon, hegemonic power, which the left has been doing and purposely Going along with it because they thought they'd collapse the dollar and have this new globalist BlackRock U.N. currency,
[02:23:10.979 --> 02:23:12.579]  but that never got done.
[02:23:12.899 --> 02:23:18.680]  So now the Chi-Coms and the Russians and the BRICS, 70% of the world's population roughly, is here.
[02:23:19.020 --> 02:23:24.879]  And if we don't have an industrial base or cheap energy and then we lose the dollar, we lose everything.
[02:23:25.729 --> 02:23:30.850]  So yeah, the globalists have used dollar domination to dominate the world, and they were moving on from that to their new system.
[02:23:31.149 --> 02:23:39.309]  Trump's against the new global, central bank digital currency with the UN and BlackRock, and he's against BRICS. He's declared both he's going to stop.
[02:23:39.610 --> 02:23:44.069]  In fact, he said six months ago in one of his video releases, he hasn't said it since.
[02:23:44.229 --> 02:23:45.110]  He said it in a few speeches.
[02:23:45.610 --> 02:23:47.170]  We need to find that, put that back out.
[02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:49.450]  That'll get 20 million views that are important and wake people up.
[02:23:49.969 --> 02:23:51.030]  I've got the exact headline.
[02:23:52.219 --> 02:23:59.399]  Something like, Trump pledges, not something like, Trump pledges to kill central bank digital currencies.
[02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:00.579]  Get me that clip.
[02:24:01.159 --> 02:24:01.600]  Please.
[02:24:02.020 --> 02:24:04.600]  Even if we run out of time here on air with it, I'm going to put a report on today.
[02:24:04.799 --> 02:24:06.260]  Because that ties into this.
[02:24:06.379 --> 02:24:16.959]  So, he's going to kill that horrible police state, new world order, cashless society, social credit score, world government, WF, bark of the beast, nightmare.
[02:24:19.219 --> 02:24:21.100]  And he said, no, no, no.
[02:24:21.319 --> 02:24:22.319]  No with rickies.
[02:24:24.559 --> 02:24:26.319]  That's power through economics.
[02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:42.459]  And just like Kirk Elliott, the economist, said months ago, he's looked at the policies, and once Trump won, it is going to Hurt the economies of a bunch of other countries.
[02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:46.319]  Which I don't take pleasure in, but once we get stabilized, we can help them.
[02:24:46.500 --> 02:24:47.719]  But we're in deep trouble.
[02:24:47.879 --> 02:24:50.959]  And we've been sold out for the globalists, so we have to do this.
[02:24:51.260 --> 02:24:52.719]  It is brutal, though.
[02:24:53.920 --> 02:24:56.420]  Trump is going to be brutal.
[02:24:59.479 --> 02:25:00.500]  Brutal to China.
[02:25:00.879 --> 02:25:02.139]  Brutal to Russia.
[02:25:03.379 --> 02:25:03.879]  Brutal.
[02:25:06.620 --> 02:25:08.879]  And so, if you want...
[02:25:10.889 --> 02:25:12.149]  America first, baby.
[02:25:12.489 --> 02:25:13.309]  You're about to get it.
[02:25:13.889 --> 02:25:15.110]  Here's what Trump said.
[02:25:16.489 --> 02:25:17.170]  Saturday.
[02:25:18.370 --> 02:25:26.430]  The idea that BRICS countries are trying to move away from the dollar while we stand by and watch is over.
[02:25:27.069 --> 02:25:50.799]  We require a And should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. economy.
[02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:54.299]  They can go find another, quote, sucker.
[02:25:54.719 --> 02:25:59.559]  There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the U.S. dollar, international trade.
[02:25:59.780 --> 02:26:04.000]  And any country that tries should wave goodbye to America.
[02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:08.440]  94.7 million people read that.
[02:26:11.020 --> 02:26:13.520]  That's more viewers than CNN has in a month.
[02:26:16.700 --> 02:26:19.000]  The mainstream media is not...
[02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:21.270]  Dead.
[02:26:21.530 --> 02:26:22.090]  They're buried.
[02:26:22.610 --> 02:26:23.649]  They're dust.
[02:26:25.370 --> 02:26:26.870]  Just a little side point.
[02:26:29.409 --> 02:26:30.290]  So...
[02:26:30.290 --> 02:26:35.350]  This is a big deal.
[02:26:37.270 --> 02:26:38.149]  And...
[02:26:38.149 --> 02:26:47.469]  The United States was inches away from sinking into history under the waves.
[02:26:49.860 --> 02:26:54.780]  And that would be a terrible future for the rest of the world if the United States is promoting freedom again.
[02:26:55.319 --> 02:26:57.319]  And baby, that's what you're about to see.
[02:26:58.979 --> 02:27:06.459]  There are a lot of powerful institutions that are not satanic completely, and they're not run by megalomaniac, total lunatics.
[02:27:07.819 --> 02:27:18.399]  And just the evil of the globalists and their plan to dominate the world by selling out the West, and then of course China and others double-crossed them, was stupid, even from an evil perspective.
[02:27:20.879 --> 02:27:24.180]  And America's lost its soft power, it's lost its name, everything.
[02:27:24.799 --> 02:27:26.520]  And the globalists are a joke.
[02:27:29.219 --> 02:27:44.520]  So, it is economically, culturally, spiritually, ethically, the only move is to reject all the carbon taxes,
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:46.899]  all the leftist BlackRock crap, all of it.
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:49.920]  And I'm hearing a lot of talk about how we've defeated it.
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:50.780]  We've not defeated it.
[02:27:50.819 --> 02:27:52.159]  They still are brainwashing kids.
[02:27:52.559 --> 02:27:53.799]  It's all over the media.
[02:27:56.559 --> 02:28:07.479]  That stuff has to all get cut off by us not supporting any of it and withdrawing ourselves from it and getting government funding cut off from it.
[02:28:08.860 --> 02:28:23.120]  Because even if these different anti-human operations are only getting 30-40% government funding on average one way or another and then a bunch of foundation money, All these groups will stop it if they don't get the government grants anymore.
[02:28:24.159 --> 02:28:35.739]  And that's why almost every major, even big Christian school in Austin, I've looked into it, without telling the parents, is teaching transgenderism, grooming, pedophilia, basically.
[02:28:39.500 --> 02:28:49.700]  And I think the parents are all just isolated when they learn about it, and your kid's already there, and you already paid a bunch of money, and Trinity, the big Christian school, all of them.
[02:28:52.059 --> 02:28:59.639]  Well, you pull your kids out of there, but it's hard to then find schools because it's everywhere.
[02:28:59.719 --> 02:29:01.739]  You cut the damn funding.
[02:29:04.379 --> 02:29:08.819]  So, we're close.
[02:29:09.159 --> 02:29:16.139]  By the way, in California, Attorney General urges snitches to report stores without gender-neutral children's sections.
[02:29:17.059 --> 02:29:18.219]  That's beyond grooming.
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:23.420]  Oh my God, you've got a girl's section with dolls and stuff, and you've got a boy's section over here.
[02:29:25.719 --> 02:29:29.540]  The mind control, the level of that social engineering, and then the snitching.
[02:29:30.799 --> 02:29:33.399]  And don't use the word mother or father, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:33.559 --> 02:29:35.079]  I mean, that's a cult, and we know that.
[02:29:36.139 --> 02:29:39.579]  $500 fines when you don't have all of it mixed together?
[02:29:41.979 --> 02:29:45.399]  As if any parent doesn't take their sons and daughters to the toy store.
[02:29:46.950 --> 02:29:54.069]  Or when you go to the grocery store or you go to the drug store and your child goes, let me look at the toy aisle.
[02:29:54.709 --> 02:29:56.389]  It's just they don't look at all of it.
[02:29:56.709 --> 02:30:03.110]  And then your daughter wants a little toy robot and she also wants the doll.
[02:30:05.049 --> 02:30:08.850]  And you just get them what they want because they did their chores for the week.
[02:30:09.309 --> 02:30:13.290]  And then your son, he wants the Hot Wheels and the toy gun.
[02:30:15.229 --> 02:30:18.790]  And the boys, Never want the doll.
[02:30:20.610 --> 02:30:23.969]  Even if they're raves in a single home, unless the mothers try to make them.
[02:30:24.270 --> 02:30:26.430]  Now the little girls, they like everything.
[02:30:27.489 --> 02:30:41.969]  You look at my youngest daughter, you look at her toy boxes and stuff, it's frisbees and footballs and dart guns and dolls and blocks and...
[02:30:41.969 --> 02:30:44.229]  I got three daughters and a son.
[02:30:45.719 --> 02:30:47.559]  The sons never want the girl toys.
[02:30:49.579 --> 02:30:51.500]  The little girls want all the toys.
[02:30:54.920 --> 02:31:02.100]  Especially if their father sits down and shows them how much fun it is to shoot dart guns.
[02:31:08.379 --> 02:31:09.540]  It doesn't hurt anything.
[02:31:09.540 --> 02:31:10.159]  They love it.
[02:31:10.719 --> 02:31:14.840]  You know, a little dart gun, old-fashioned, once you shove the dart in, it's got the rubber tip.
[02:31:15.860 --> 02:31:26.299]  The first time you're sitting there with your five-year-old daughter and the squirrel's sitting on the backyard, you go, honey, the squirrel's sitting there eating the sunflower seeds you put out for it.
[02:31:26.360 --> 02:31:26.840]  It's not mean.
[02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:27.299]  It's fun.
[02:31:27.420 --> 02:31:27.979]  It's normal behavior.
[02:31:28.360 --> 02:31:29.780]  You just go, watch this, sweetheart.
[02:31:31.299 --> 02:31:32.280]  Shoot that squirrel.
[02:31:32.459 --> 02:31:33.280]  He comes back later.
[02:31:33.940 --> 02:31:35.500]  And she goes, that's fun.
[02:31:35.620 --> 02:31:36.280]  That's hunting.
[02:31:36.959 --> 02:31:38.360]  And now she goes, I want more.
[02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:39.159]  I want more guns.
[02:31:39.280 --> 02:31:39.879]  I want more guns.
[02:31:39.959 --> 02:31:41.340]  Well, let's go shoot a real one tomorrow.
[02:31:43.299 --> 02:31:51.340]  And they love fishing and they love driving a tractor, but they gravitate towards the dolls because it's instinctive.
[02:31:53.139 --> 02:31:58.000]  And they gravitate to the kitchen and want to cook stuff because that's what women in our species do.
[02:31:58.219 --> 02:31:59.059]  The men do it too.
[02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:05.319]  The point is, is they want to get us out of our natural selves to screw us up and not make us fulfilled.
[02:32:05.500 --> 02:32:10.590]  They want robots to Elon Musk says, you know, everybody wants a robot to cook their dinner?
[02:32:10.709 --> 02:32:12.750]  Well, maybe Elon Musk does, he's so busy, but no.
[02:32:13.709 --> 02:32:16.610]  One of my favorite things to do when I got the time is cook dinner.
[02:32:16.809 --> 02:32:17.649]  I like it.
[02:32:18.569 --> 02:32:19.750]  So does my wife.
[02:32:20.049 --> 02:32:21.329]  And so does my children.
[02:32:21.530 --> 02:32:22.270]  That's normal.
[02:32:23.989 --> 02:32:24.889]  All right, I'm digressing.
[02:32:26.950 --> 02:32:29.829]  So this Trump thing is a really, really, really, really, really big deal.
[02:32:30.309 --> 02:32:31.430]  Talk about America first.
[02:32:32.549 --> 02:32:33.469]  There it is.
[02:32:33.629 --> 02:32:34.170]  All right.
[02:32:35.579 --> 02:32:38.840]  How are they going to counter us?
[02:32:40.139 --> 02:32:42.120]  Well, here it is right here.
[02:32:42.340 --> 02:32:43.940]  Got a bunch of stacks on this.
[02:32:45.120 --> 02:32:55.280]  World leaders sign new censorship declaration at UN event while Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez pushes for increased online censorship.
[02:32:55.440 --> 02:32:58.819]  You gotta go read the actual reports for yourself.
[02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:03.120]  But it's an internet ID. It's for adults and children.
[02:33:03.120 --> 02:33:04.639]  It tracks everything you do.
[02:33:04.780 --> 02:33:06.139]  And then you get punished.
[02:33:06.340 --> 02:33:07.600]  The countries sign on to the agreement.
[02:33:07.760 --> 02:33:09.319]  Follow UNESCO, UN directives.
[02:33:09.399 --> 02:33:09.979]  Don't say mother.
[02:33:10.100 --> 02:33:10.600]  Don't say father.
[02:33:11.180 --> 02:33:13.159]  It's not about stopping kids looking at porn.
[02:33:13.379 --> 02:33:22.020]  It's about internet IDs for taxation, control, censorship, and blacklisting people that aren't good little globalists where you can't even get online, which then means you can't go to the grocery store.
[02:33:22.079 --> 02:33:22.940]  You can't drive a car.
[02:33:23.100 --> 02:33:24.399]  It's the social credit score.
[02:33:24.620 --> 02:33:25.680]  A huge article.
[02:33:25.860 --> 02:33:26.440]  A big deal.
[02:33:28.430 --> 02:33:29.590]  On Infowars.com.
[02:33:30.129 --> 02:33:31.329]  And you got good news.
[02:33:31.489 --> 02:33:39.770]  Incoming FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, combating tech censorship is going to be one of our top priorities, Fox News.
[02:33:40.409 --> 02:33:44.569]  Because if any of these groups take federal funding, it's illegal to do that.
[02:33:45.250 --> 02:33:48.110]  But they've been doing it, and it's about to run into a brick wall.
[02:33:48.290 --> 02:33:51.209]  It's not the FCC coming and controlling big tech's activities.
[02:33:51.489 --> 02:33:57.709]  They're just saying, you do that, we're going to cut any government contracts off your butt.
[02:34:02.590 --> 02:34:03.809]  And that brings me to Texas.
[02:34:04.889 --> 02:34:06.510]  Texas war on porn.
[02:34:08.110 --> 02:34:09.549]  And it's Ken Paxton.
[02:34:09.770 --> 02:34:12.889]  And they just made the seven biggest porn operations.
[02:34:13.829 --> 02:34:15.950]  They're 90 plus percent of all porn.
[02:34:16.790 --> 02:34:18.129]  Get age verification.
[02:34:18.350 --> 02:34:19.030]  Sounds reasonable?
[02:34:19.250 --> 02:34:21.270]  A good first level move.
[02:34:22.350 --> 02:34:26.450]  The problem is you look at second, third order consequences.
[02:34:26.530 --> 02:34:38.659]  It gives you an internet ID... Which then the Democrats have filed lawsuits in Texas and other states, three other states they're doing this, to say, well, that's not fair.
[02:34:38.899 --> 02:34:43.840]  Everybody has to have their internet ID. And some Republicans are like, okay, we'll do that for everything now.
[02:34:44.079 --> 02:34:44.440]  See?
[02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:48.719]  It's up to parents to keep their children off that, not the government.
[02:34:50.010 --> 02:34:52.889]  And that's just what's happening in Europe and Australia.
[02:34:53.389 --> 02:34:58.450]  Australian Parliament banned social media for under-16s with world's first law.
[02:34:58.649 --> 02:35:06.889]  First it was porn, a year later, now it's social media, and everybody's got to have internet ID to do it, and they said they're going to control everything you do in surveillance.
[02:35:07.889 --> 02:35:08.889]  See how it works?
[02:35:09.290 --> 02:35:11.709]  It's not my opinion this is a bad move.
[02:35:11.930 --> 02:35:13.250]  It is a bad move.
[02:35:13.250 --> 02:35:15.489]  It's a Trojan horse, and it's stupid.
[02:35:19.659 --> 02:35:21.000]  That now leads me to this.
[02:35:23.260 --> 02:35:24.799]  You've got EU officials.
[02:35:24.959 --> 02:35:31.340]  You've got the Australian government and Broadcasting Association coming out because nobody's listening to them or watching them now.
[02:35:32.239 --> 02:35:34.200]  Puppet after puppet keeps getting thrown out.
[02:35:36.399 --> 02:35:38.520]  And they go, it's Joe Rogan's fault.
[02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:39.319]  He's nasty.
[02:35:39.319 --> 02:35:39.879]  He's mean.
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  He's praying on people's fears.
[02:35:41.379 --> 02:35:43.459]  He's saying the shots weren't good for you.
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:45.079]  They lied about it all.
[02:35:45.219 --> 02:35:46.440]  I'll show you a bunch of documents in a moment.
[02:35:47.889 --> 02:35:49.629]  The globalists are in full crisis mode.
[02:35:55.209 --> 02:35:55.770]  No.
[02:35:56.129 --> 02:36:00.069]  Joe Rogan had expert guests on and had the courage to warn people he's a hero.
[02:36:01.350 --> 02:36:03.829]  Everybody that shared the information are heroes.
[02:36:04.389 --> 02:36:05.909]  And he's been proven right.
[02:36:06.129 --> 02:36:06.969]  We've been proven right.
[02:36:07.850 --> 02:36:10.149]  Elon Musk's brother almost got killed by the shot.
[02:36:11.489 --> 02:36:12.590]  He's been proven right.
[02:36:13.090 --> 02:36:13.649]  So...
[02:36:15.059 --> 02:36:18.979]  Everything they say in this short clip is what they themselves have done.
[02:36:19.100 --> 02:36:19.540]  Here it is.
[02:36:20.520 --> 02:36:29.139]  I have a question about Joe Rogan, and you've sort of touched on elements of this in the US. He's obviously the world's most popular podcast host.
[02:36:29.299 --> 02:36:30.579]  He has three billion listeners.
[02:36:30.860 --> 02:36:34.819]  He's sort of managed to successfully capture that bro market in America.
[02:36:35.139 --> 02:36:44.299]  And his influence is such that in the wake of the US election, the Democrats have said that one of Kamala Harris's mistakes was that she didn't appear on his program.
[02:36:44.969 --> 02:37:02.329]  So I'm just wondering if you had any observations about what's behind the Joe Rogan effect, how you believe he's managed to so successfully capture this huge market, and then for us here in Australia, you know, how would or should the ABC be going about capturing that kind of audience?
[02:37:04.010 --> 02:37:08.530]  Look, I'm not sure that I'm the right person to respond to that question.
[02:37:08.530 --> 02:37:16.030]  I am not a consumer or enthusiast about Mr Rogan and his work.
[02:37:17.510 --> 02:37:20.229]  I am not one of the $3 billion.
[02:37:21.020 --> 02:37:25.479]  And I'm unlikely to be $3.1 billion any time soon.
[02:37:26.600 --> 02:37:33.440]  I think people like Mr Rogan prey on people's vulnerabilities.
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:35.280]  They prey on fear.
[02:37:36.110 --> 02:37:39.030]  They prey on anxiety.
[02:37:39.030 --> 02:37:46.350]  They prey on all of the elements that contribute to uncertainty in society.
[02:37:46.610 --> 02:37:58.030]  And they entrepreneur fantasy outcomes and conspiracy outcomes as being a normal part of social narrative.
[02:37:58.629 --> 02:38:02.170]  I personally find it deeply repulsive.
[02:38:03.170 --> 02:38:14.889]  And to think that someone has such remarkable power in the United States is something that I look at in disbelief.
[02:38:15.149 --> 02:38:32.030]  I'm also absolutely in dismay that this can be a source of public entertainment when it's really treating the public as plunder for purposes that are really quite malevolent.
[02:38:32.709 --> 02:38:34.809]  All right, I can talk for an hour about that clip.
[02:38:35.229 --> 02:38:44.909]  So having dozens and dozens and dozens of top scientists on, laying out how the shots erase your immune system, make you really sick, showing all the facts, the studies, that's entertainment.
[02:38:45.649 --> 02:38:48.850]  Also, three billion people, I don't even know where they get those numbers.
[02:38:48.950 --> 02:38:51.969]  The point is, Elon Musk had Trump on and had a billion listeners.
[02:38:52.370 --> 02:38:53.709]  All these shows are viral.
[02:38:53.930 --> 02:38:57.809]  Rogan is consistently on all platforms at the top.
[02:38:59.399 --> 02:39:02.139]  But they try to act like, oh, it's just this one guy.
[02:39:02.139 --> 02:39:02.940]  He did it.
[02:39:03.159 --> 02:39:04.500]  And it's just entertainment.
[02:39:05.979 --> 02:39:07.159]  Let me show you this.
[02:39:07.940 --> 02:39:11.979]  I'm going to shoot a special report on this today because I could do an hour on this.
[02:39:13.079 --> 02:39:16.000]  Here's the Senate Select Committee Coronavirus Pandemic.
[02:39:17.149 --> 02:39:19.010]  After action review of the COVID-19 pandemic.
[02:39:19.209 --> 02:39:20.530]  It is incredible.
[02:39:20.729 --> 02:39:21.409]  Just came out.
[02:39:21.850 --> 02:39:23.030]  600 pages long.
[02:39:23.170 --> 02:39:24.069]  Just the synopses.
[02:39:24.270 --> 02:39:25.430]  It was lab made.
[02:39:25.569 --> 02:39:26.049]  They lied.
[02:39:26.170 --> 02:39:26.969]  The shots don't work.
[02:39:27.110 --> 02:39:27.770]  It's total tyranny.
[02:39:27.870 --> 02:39:28.870]  The lockdowns hurt kids.
[02:39:29.030 --> 02:39:29.549]  It's all a fraud.
[02:39:29.709 --> 02:39:31.049]  It was number of psychological warfare purposes.
[02:39:31.329 --> 02:39:33.829]  They recommend criminal investigations for everybody involved.
[02:39:33.969 --> 02:39:35.530]  None of these groups should ever get government funding again.
[02:39:35.850 --> 02:39:37.329]  It's just insane.
[02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:39.350]  Okay.
[02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:41.170]  Oh, that's Joe Rogan, huh?
[02:39:41.850 --> 02:39:55.809]  Major British study with Oxford and Harvard of the government database that comprises 40% of the people that took the Moderna shot, that's how big the database is, found 1.7 million kids and teens who got the Pfizer shot found myocarditis only in the vax groups.
[02:39:57.770 --> 02:40:01.590]  Bombshell study, 1.7 million vaccinated kids now have severe heart problems.
[02:40:04.090 --> 02:40:06.909]  Here's Obama going in and telling kids to take their shots.
[02:40:07.829 --> 02:40:11.170]  Here's Biden saying, we're not going to tolerate you not taking the shots, you must take them.
[02:40:11.370 --> 02:40:12.389]  Violates the Nuremberg Code.
[02:40:12.590 --> 02:40:16.549]  Here's Joe Rogan with a guest talking about the insurance actuaries, tens of millions dead.
[02:40:17.149 --> 02:40:18.010]  It's all here.
[02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:28.129]  And now, Trump picks Jay Bhattacharya, top scientist, he exposes all this, as his NIH head.
[02:40:29.290 --> 02:40:32.309]  Trump picks lockdown critic to lead health agency.
[02:40:35.079 --> 02:40:38.139]  It goes on and on and on.
[02:40:38.979 --> 02:40:42.260]  So, that's the facts, Jack.
[02:40:46.579 --> 02:40:52.780]  And now, the head of the UK, Keir Starmer, has come out and said...
[02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:59.729]  Oh, turns out replacement migration's real and it's deliberate to destroy our countries when he's been massively behind it.
[02:40:59.870 --> 02:41:02.389]  I mean, it's just a rout of these people.
[02:41:02.549 --> 02:41:11.309]  You get a bunch of dinosaurs like the Broadcasting Association had with a bunch of corporate media with almost no viewers going, it's just ridiculous.
[02:41:11.309 --> 02:41:12.850]  I don't know what's going on.
[02:41:13.010 --> 02:41:14.610]  He somehow convinced them.
[02:41:14.709 --> 02:41:15.629]  He hypnotized them.
[02:41:15.969 --> 02:41:18.170]  No, we know you're a pack of scum.
[02:41:19.139 --> 02:41:20.680]  You're going to prison, dirtbag!
[02:41:20.899 --> 02:41:27.120]  I am cutting this important announcement right in the middle of the November 5th, 2024 election.
[02:41:27.239 --> 02:41:28.659]  We'll be running this for a week or so.
[02:41:28.899 --> 02:41:34.479]  And it looks like a big Trump win, but they are in full steam ahead with election fraud at levels that were foreseen.
[02:41:35.239 --> 02:41:50.219]  Regardless of whether we're able to defeat this fraud or not, the awakening And the massive amount of support for Trump and traditional liberals and others waking up and joining us and realizing the Democratic Party ally with the neocons is cancer has been incredible.
[02:41:50.219 --> 02:41:52.920]  And it's part of the larger global realignment happening all over the planet.
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:56.200]  But we can't control everything individually.
[02:41:56.200 --> 02:41:58.000]  We can just work towards a better outcome.
[02:41:58.020 --> 02:41:59.840]  And it's a process and we're starting to get traction.
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:00.860]  And I've got faith.
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:19.860]  But regardless, with all the garbage and all the viruses out there and all the drug resistance and Antibiotic-resistant bacteria and crap that's out there, especially in the winter when our immune systems are down, it is so important to boost our body's defenses naturally that God gave us.
[02:42:20.340 --> 02:42:23.760]  Now, if you go to our great sponsor, DrJonesNaturals.com, there's a lot of great products.
[02:42:23.899 --> 02:42:29.059]  And they're key to keeping us on the air if InfoWars is shut down next week or if we're not shut down, continuing on here.
[02:42:29.299 --> 02:42:31.579]  We try to bring you through our sponsor's amazing products.
[02:42:31.700 --> 02:42:35.860]  Now, we've got two new products at DrJonesNaturals.com that are staples.
[02:42:36.229 --> 02:42:37.969]  They're known and amazing.
[02:42:38.229 --> 02:42:44.270]  And these are high-quality versions of it, the best organic sources, and at very, very low prices.
[02:42:44.770 --> 02:42:48.309]  Two new products, introductory price, limited time, 40% off.
[02:42:48.430 --> 02:42:52.670]  And everybody needs quercetin, and everybody needs high-quality CoQ10.
[02:42:52.870 --> 02:42:57.629]  And both of these are high-quality, large doses, at a very low price.
[02:42:58.329 --> 02:43:04.409]  Most competing brands, say, of CoQ10 of this quality and this dose, on average are about $60 a bottle.
[02:43:05.360 --> 02:43:08.979]  This is way, way lower than that, and it funds the Infowar.
[02:43:09.159 --> 02:43:13.159]  And then, of course, Quercetin Max, really strong, high-powered Quercetin.
[02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:15.840]  Let me tell you, in case you don't know, what these do.
[02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:23.079]  CoQ10, massive energy production, cellular power, cleaning out the cells, antioxidant properties, heart health.
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:23.879]  This is all on record.
[02:43:23.940 --> 02:43:24.459]  This is admitted.
[02:43:25.709 --> 02:43:32.030]  Improved exercise performance, cognitive health, diabetes management, skin health, immune support.
[02:43:32.270 --> 02:43:34.870]  I mean, you just ask chat GPT this and it'll tell you.
[02:43:35.270 --> 02:43:44.049]  Let's look at quercetin, antioxidant properties, immune system support, anti-inflammatory effects, allergy relief, heart health, antiviral and antibacterial properties.
[02:43:44.170 --> 02:43:44.729]  That's the big one.
[02:43:45.209 --> 02:43:52.090]  Supports respiratory health, blood sugar regulation, improves exercise performance, brain health, cognitive, all of it.
[02:43:52.639 --> 02:44:02.719]  So these are amazing known staples that are so good for your body, your immune system, but not just so you have a better chance of not getting ill.
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:06.440]  It's the overall general quality of life you're going to have.
[02:44:06.600 --> 02:44:10.219]  So I take both of these now at drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:12.479]  They're available for 40% off limited time.
[02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:16.420]  And if InfoWars shuts down next week, We're not going to have InfoWare Store anymore.
[02:44:16.739 --> 02:44:27.059]  We're going to have our sponsors like drjonesnaturals.com and the alexjonesstore.com for the equipment, the satellite uplinks, the crew, the servers, the reporters, the writers, just all of it.
[02:44:27.180 --> 02:44:29.940]  And the legal as we keep battling the globalists as they try to shut us down.
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:31.500]  So we're going to continue our amazing work.
[02:44:31.600 --> 02:44:32.799]  We cannot do it without your support.
[02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:34.079]  This is a no-brainer.
[02:44:34.219 --> 02:44:35.860]  You need to get this wherever you get it.
[02:44:36.079 --> 02:44:39.360]  If you got this stuff at Whole Foods, you know, they've got other great versions there.
[02:44:39.440 --> 02:44:41.139]  Everybody knows about Coruscant and CoQ10.
[02:44:41.420 --> 02:44:42.200]  These are established.
[02:44:42.360 --> 02:44:42.920]  These are known.
[02:44:43.079 --> 02:44:44.139]  These are the game changers.

[02:45:02.090 --> 02:45:11.569]  While humanity slept, the satanically controlled globalists spun their webs across the planet to ensnare humanity.
[02:45:11.930 --> 02:45:27.379]  But now, After hundreds of millions have been slowly murdered by the tyrants, humanity has struggled out of the depths of their coma, and now the mass awakening is accelerating.
[02:45:28.639 --> 02:45:35.399]  I want to hit some more news before we talk to some special guests coming up in studio.
[02:45:36.639 --> 02:45:54.500]  But since I mentioned earlier, talking about Trump and BRICS, And how he's going after these nations that are trying to replace the dollar, and what an incredible America First movement that is, and how it's going to kill the BRICS system and the globalist cashless society,
[02:45:54.879 --> 02:45:56.040]  central bank digital currency.
[02:45:56.319 --> 02:46:03.579]  That's very important to stop the globalist operation, the CHICOM operation, but also rebuild America.
[02:46:05.139 --> 02:46:08.559]  Here's Trump pledging to stop central bank digital currencies previously.
[02:46:11.399 --> 02:46:12.579]  But Vivek is great.
[02:46:12.780 --> 02:46:13.399]  He's really great.
[02:46:13.479 --> 02:46:16.219]  But he wanted this, and I'll give him full credit for it.
[02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:17.200]  It's very important, actually.
[02:46:17.399 --> 02:46:21.780]  I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.
[02:46:23.959 --> 02:46:28.239]  I will keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your Bitcoin.
[02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:34.579]  And I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.
[02:46:38.059 --> 02:46:42.719]  And tonight I'm also making another promise to protect Americans from government tyranny.
[02:46:42.940 --> 02:46:48.360]  As you're president, I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:53.639]  I didn't know you know so much.
[02:46:54.020 --> 02:46:56.180]  Well, New Hampshire, very smart people.
[02:46:57.399 --> 02:46:58.700]  Very, very current.
[02:46:58.959 --> 02:46:59.860]  You know what they're doing.
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:05.700]  Such a currency would give a federal government, our federal government, the absolute control over your money.
[02:47:05.819 --> 02:47:08.239]  They could take your money, you wouldn't even know it was gone.
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:14.739]  This would be a dangerous threat to freedom, and I will stop it from coming to America.
[02:47:15.860 --> 02:47:17.459]  All right, here's the deal.
[02:47:20.040 --> 02:47:23.780]  This new Senate report on the COVID power grab is so key, I'm gonna shoot a report.
[02:47:25.059 --> 02:47:26.239]  It'll be out in the next few hours.
[02:47:26.860 --> 02:47:30.520]  I'm going to shoot one on bricks with just a quick boil down on a few other documents.
[02:47:31.059 --> 02:47:34.799]  And then I've been trying to cover this since Friday, but I just keep running out of time.
[02:47:35.959 --> 02:47:39.239]  The federal government is getting ready to roll out and they're announcing it.
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:40.899]  This is getting almost no attention.
[02:47:41.139 --> 02:47:42.479]  A weather control bureau.
[02:47:42.659 --> 02:47:43.659]  I thought there's no weather control.
[02:47:43.860 --> 02:47:44.860]  This is a big deal.
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:49.680]  The U.S. is building an early warning system to detect geoengineering.
[02:47:50.399 --> 02:47:51.819]  We'll get into the fine print.
[02:47:53.780 --> 02:47:54.659]  Coming up.
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:47:58.399]  All right.
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:07.780]  I covered about half the news.
[02:48:08.079 --> 02:48:09.020]  That's better than usual.
[02:48:11.159 --> 02:48:12.739]  The rest of the hour is coming up.
[02:48:16.280 --> 02:48:19.680]  The war room is in 57 minutes with the great Owen Schroer.
[02:48:19.940 --> 02:48:21.139]  I was going to say this.
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.260]  We've survived so many attacks thanks to your support.
[02:48:24.540 --> 02:48:25.139]  Couldn't do it without you.
[02:48:25.239 --> 02:48:29.000]  It's taken a lot of money to fight the Democratic Party lawfare.
[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:30.379]  Other people didn't hold out this long.
[02:48:30.500 --> 02:48:31.000]  Trump did.
[02:48:31.159 --> 02:48:32.040]  He's got a lot more money than I do.
[02:48:32.100 --> 02:48:32.559]  So did Musk.
[02:48:32.959 --> 02:48:37.760]  I'm in another category reaching 100 million people a day, 100 million views.
[02:48:37.959 --> 02:48:39.100]  We're having a big effect.
[02:48:39.940 --> 02:48:40.979]  It's not a competition.
[02:48:41.819 --> 02:48:44.620]  But I'm junior, way junior when it comes to money.
[02:48:45.879 --> 02:48:46.979]  I'm basically out of money.
[02:48:47.379 --> 02:48:48.420]  I need your support.
[02:48:48.420 --> 02:48:49.479]  Plus, I've got great products.
[02:48:49.680 --> 02:48:50.739]  Please take action.
[02:48:52.370 --> 02:48:55.370]  For the Victory Fund to save him for wars and keep him for wars.
[02:48:55.489 --> 02:48:58.690]  But regardless, when you buy products, the AlexJonesStore.com, that's an outside sponsor.
[02:48:59.129 --> 02:49:01.090]  They're supporting the Alex Jones Network as well.
[02:49:01.350 --> 02:49:02.309]  Everything going on there.
[02:49:02.450 --> 02:49:06.309]  And I tell you, at these hearings, the Democrat Party lawyers just get so pissed.
[02:49:06.430 --> 02:49:09.469]  The judges are like, that's totally legal for him to do another network with other people he's working with.
[02:49:10.090 --> 02:49:12.590]  You know, with other bosses, Jones wants to work with.
[02:49:13.010 --> 02:49:17.610]  And, you know, with all these fake judgments, the rest of it, I just can't own the companies.
[02:49:17.690 --> 02:49:18.149]  Well, that's fine.
[02:49:18.149 --> 02:49:19.290]  I don't want to own a company.
[02:49:19.290 --> 02:49:20.809]  I want to have total free speech on the air.
[02:49:21.899 --> 02:49:27.840]  So I still own InfoWars for now, and I think we'll survive because what they did was ridiculous with new owners, good Patriot owners.
[02:49:28.020 --> 02:49:29.260]  I think the bad guys are going to fail.
[02:49:30.149 --> 02:49:32.969]  If there's any justice, but we gotta make sure we have a backup.
[02:49:33.170 --> 02:49:34.989]  So support me now, our work.
[02:49:35.309 --> 02:49:36.229]  Can't do it without you.
[02:49:36.409 --> 02:49:37.590]  Plus, the products are great.
[02:49:38.110 --> 02:49:40.690]  The Alex Show Store.com, Black Friday sales is going on right now.
[02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:41.350]  Best deals ever.
[02:49:41.510 --> 02:49:42.989]  We are now into hour number two.
[02:49:43.129 --> 02:49:47.729]  It is Friday, November 22nd, 2024. I'll be going through the entire four hours until 3 p.m.
[02:49:47.870 --> 02:49:48.370]  Central today.
[02:49:49.030 --> 02:49:52.090]  Then Ellen Schroyer will be hosting the War Room 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:49:52.149 --> 02:49:56.370]  from the Infowars studios that we were kicked out of by the Justice Department illegally with no court order.
[02:49:57.209 --> 02:49:59.270]  Last Thursday, we were back in Friday.
[02:49:59.690 --> 02:50:01.069]  Where's the national news?
[02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:02.790]  The judge said the auction didn't happen.
[02:50:03.590 --> 02:50:05.510]  They tried to kick us out May 31st.
[02:50:05.610 --> 02:50:09.530]  That's how desperate the system is to take this broadcast off the air.
[02:50:09.649 --> 02:50:14.489]  So I've talked about and broke the secret peace summit that Trump is having at Mar-a-Lago.
[02:50:14.649 --> 02:50:15.750]  I told you that yesterday.
[02:50:15.829 --> 02:50:17.149]  It's in the news today.
[02:50:17.629 --> 02:50:19.049]  Should be a lot bigger deal.
[02:50:19.209 --> 02:50:20.270]  Thank God Trump's doing that.
[02:50:20.450 --> 02:50:22.530]  The head of NATO is there right now.
[02:50:23.290 --> 02:50:25.370]  The globalists will try to sabotage that.
[02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:26.909]  We'll be talking about it.
[02:50:27.030 --> 02:50:34.530]  I'll open the phones up for the balance of the broadcast and cover all the other news and the appointment fights and what's happening in the economy and more.
[02:50:35.049 --> 02:50:37.690]  But something very exciting is happening today.
[02:50:37.850 --> 02:50:53.219]  If you remember going back two months ago, We're good to go.
[02:50:58.780 --> 02:51:06.059]  The Alex Jones Network at AJN Live on X. And we did when we got shut down just for a day last week.
[02:51:06.159 --> 02:51:07.379]  Before that, we'd done test broadcast.
[02:51:07.760 --> 02:51:11.979]  Those broadcasts, that broadcast Thursday from there.
[02:51:12.239 --> 02:51:14.700]  And we were still there Friday, even though we could get back in the building.
[02:51:14.700 --> 02:51:17.819]  We were already set there, so we did another day from the Alex Jones Network.
[02:51:19.059 --> 02:51:24.979]  We were able to tie into our studios here and stay on all the radio and TV satellites and reach tens of millions that way.
[02:51:26.530 --> 02:51:32.329]  We reached over 140 million people on X alone last Thursday and Friday.
[02:51:32.790 --> 02:51:34.670]  That's delivering the truth to the people.
[02:51:34.969 --> 02:51:47.290]  That's what you invested in when you go to thealexjohnstore.com and get incredible patriot apparel to spread the word and meet like-minded people when you get some of the most incredible supplements and fundraiser posters and more.
[02:51:47.469 --> 02:51:49.930]  You are at the tip of the spear, not me.
[02:51:50.409 --> 02:51:59.559]  You are at the tip of the spear with me, fighting the globalists with the key analysis and key guest, And reports that they absolutely hate.
[02:51:59.780 --> 02:52:02.680]  So, Bigly's been around for a long time.
[02:52:02.799 --> 02:52:05.479]  They're some of the big sponsors of some of the top patriot shows out there.
[02:52:05.579 --> 02:52:10.360]  They're, I think, the best designers and one of the top selling designers of Trump and Patriot gear.
[02:52:10.620 --> 02:52:12.319]  And they've been trying to work with me for a while.
[02:52:12.700 --> 02:52:14.540]  And I was just so busy not focused on it.
[02:52:14.600 --> 02:52:17.260]  But I did because I knew Infowars could be shut down.
[02:52:17.860 --> 02:52:22.020]  And so we needed a backup system, and they were a lot of folks we talked to and looked at.
[02:52:22.219 --> 02:52:28.239]  They were the best folks to work with, and they got their factories making knives and everything up in the t-shirts up in Arkansas.
[02:52:28.239 --> 02:52:29.979]  We wanted that to help American workers.
[02:52:30.200 --> 02:52:31.540]  They got a lot of veterans that worked there.
[02:52:32.239 --> 02:52:41.799]  And they said, you know, we've done this for Crowder and a bunch of other people, over 100 hosts, giveaways of trucks and cars and Off-road vehicles and all sorts of other cool stuff.
[02:52:42.200 --> 02:52:43.059]  We want to do it with you.
[02:52:43.340 --> 02:52:44.479]  They said, what type of truck do you like?
[02:52:44.540 --> 02:52:45.479]  And I said, well, this is a cool truck.
[02:52:46.079 --> 02:52:47.340]  And they said, okay, so they got it.
[02:52:47.420 --> 02:52:47.899]  Then I drove it.
[02:52:47.979 --> 02:52:49.020]  I was like, my gosh, I love this.
[02:52:49.139 --> 02:52:49.620]  It's so smooth.
[02:52:49.959 --> 02:52:50.659]  So amazing.
[02:52:51.440 --> 02:52:52.639]  $136,000 value.
[02:52:53.500 --> 02:52:57.680]  Just the baddest turbo diesel off-road package basically there is.
[02:52:58.439 --> 02:52:59.600]  It's just insane.
[02:52:59.879 --> 02:53:04.200]  I'm not knocking my 12-year-old Ford truck, but man, it is a rattle trap compared to this.
[02:53:04.340 --> 02:53:05.940]  Of course, the new Fords are super smooth as well.
[02:53:06.120 --> 02:53:09.579]  So this is not your granddaddy's pickup truck or even your pickup truck.
[02:53:10.700 --> 02:53:14.520]  And so anybody that bought product there on the site got entered to win.
[02:53:14.819 --> 02:53:16.799]  You didn't have to buy something.
[02:53:16.899 --> 02:53:19.159]  You can also put your email in and get entered once to win.
[02:53:19.219 --> 02:53:24.760]  But when you bought product, you got entered 5, 10x, depending on the day, it varied every day, into the sweepstakes.
[02:53:25.610 --> 02:53:32.829]  And so I also added on, I said, well, that's $136,000 truck, $138,000 truck and $2,000 cash.
[02:53:33.030 --> 02:53:37.629]  I said, let's add getting the winner here to Austin, Texas as well.
[02:53:37.809 --> 02:53:40.629]  So what a wild card.
[02:53:40.809 --> 02:53:46.430]  Who knows who the winner would be of tens of thousands of people that go buy products, and we have the winner here.
[02:53:46.959 --> 02:53:49.139]  And you guys are obviously patriots.
[02:53:49.280 --> 02:53:50.120]  You're really...
[02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:51.940]  I watch your videos all the time, guys.
[02:53:52.479 --> 02:53:55.020]  Nate Hughes and Colin Sanders.
[02:53:55.260 --> 02:53:58.620]  But I just met Chris Delaro today.
[02:53:59.079 --> 02:54:02.159]  Learned he was the winner a few days ago.
[02:54:02.360 --> 02:54:04.659]  He's an Air Force veteran, a patriot.
[02:54:04.879 --> 02:54:06.139]  But he came down to Austin, Texas.
[02:54:06.260 --> 02:54:07.059]  You guys flew him down.
[02:54:07.260 --> 02:54:09.639]  The folks at the AlexJoneStore.com.
[02:54:09.760 --> 02:54:11.379]  So very, very exciting.
[02:54:11.540 --> 02:54:14.239]  And it turns out he's been listening for a long time.
[02:54:14.780 --> 02:54:15.840]  Very exciting.
[02:54:16.500 --> 02:54:22.200]  Interesting story, how he found the show, and it's just great to have him here.
[02:54:22.479 --> 02:54:27.219]  So, Nate Hughes, Colin Sanders, you want to start first and tell us about this?
[02:54:27.280 --> 02:54:32.100]  This is a lot of fun, and I also can't wait, whether we're in these studios or not, this is going to continue on.
[02:54:32.579 --> 02:54:38.360]  In a few months, we'll have the new winner, and if they want to come here, they'll be here, and I can't wait to buy you lunch, brother.
[02:54:39.299 --> 02:54:40.959]  I hope you can go on the other shows as well.
[02:54:41.159 --> 02:54:42.260]  So, who wants to start first?
[02:54:42.600 --> 02:54:43.120]  I can go.
[02:54:43.920 --> 02:54:51.959]  Yeah, Chris is the first official winner of the Alex Jones store giveaway, the first truck giveaway that I believe you've ever done, correct Alex?
[02:54:52.100 --> 02:54:52.260]  Yes.
[02:54:52.479 --> 02:54:56.600]  Yeah, first ever vehicle giveaway, $136,000 value giveaway.
[02:54:56.860 --> 02:54:57.879]  Chris is the big winner.
[02:54:58.340 --> 02:55:02.219]  I think you bought two t-shirts, and was it two t-shirts, Chris?
[02:55:02.379 --> 02:55:03.319]  Two t-shirts, yes.
[02:55:03.659 --> 02:55:06.739]  Yeah, two t-shirts, so I think a $75 order.
[02:55:09.099 --> 02:55:16.979]  Returned $136,000 truck, $10,000 in cash, and you get to come down here, be on the show with Alex, meet Alex, and we're gonna eat some food here in a little bit.
[02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:19.899]  So I think it's, man, it's awesome.
[02:55:20.340 --> 02:55:20.700]  Congratulations.
[02:55:21.040 --> 02:55:28.440]  And thank you, Alex, for allowing Bigly, myself and Colin and our 100 employees back home in Arkansas, thank you for giving us this opportunity.
[02:55:28.819 --> 02:55:31.239]  And we're just excited to be here and do this giveaway.
[02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:33.420]  Well, I want to go to Chris now, but I wanted to say this.
[02:55:34.450 --> 02:55:35.450]  I want to thank the listeners.
[02:55:35.629 --> 02:55:38.370]  They're all the winners, and so are we.
[02:55:39.329 --> 02:55:51.690]  Hands down, 100%, we would not be on the air right now if you guys hadn't pestered the daylights out of me for over a year before and pestered my crew because I just get so busy and I'm not even really focused on money.
[02:55:51.790 --> 02:55:53.590]  I'm focused on the show, but I need money to fight.
[02:55:54.110 --> 02:55:57.350]  So we try to come up with things that are great people like so they get it and keep funding us.
[02:55:58.049 --> 02:56:03.129]  But I'm so glad we got to working with you because we wouldn't be here right now.
[02:56:03.850 --> 02:56:05.170]  We're barely here right now.
[02:56:05.649 --> 02:56:12.569]  I'm having to sue the Democrat operatives, the gun control group, the onion people, the US trustee from the Justice Department for what they did.
[02:56:12.750 --> 02:56:13.049]  We're winning.
[02:56:13.569 --> 02:56:14.969]  It takes a lot of money to do that.
[02:56:15.129 --> 02:56:15.729]  This is a fight.
[02:56:15.829 --> 02:56:17.909]  The globalists are coming after me as a symbol of liberty.
[02:56:18.479 --> 02:56:21.879]  And they're going to keep harassing me and my family, but I'm a big boy.
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:25.719]  I knew what I was getting into, but everybody's a winner that entered the contest.
[02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:29.219]  You have a lot of other things you never even told me you would do, other little special prizes.
[02:56:29.219 --> 02:56:33.559]  Anybody that is a VIP member gets 40 bucks a month to spend in the store for $30 a month, canceling time.
[02:56:33.739 --> 02:56:37.780]  They get special sales on top of sales, special offers, special products nobody else gets access to.
[02:56:38.180 --> 02:56:42.559]  Everybody needs to go to the Alex SchoenStore.com and become a VIP. This is history.
[02:56:42.760 --> 02:56:44.239]  You are the reason we're here.
[02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:45.360]  I want that to sink into listeners.
[02:56:45.940 --> 02:56:48.979]  So, Chris, thank you so much for being here.
[02:56:49.780 --> 02:56:52.100]  And I was talking to you before the show, you're a pretty smart guy.
[02:56:52.340 --> 02:56:53.559]  My listeners are pretty amazing.
[02:56:53.979 --> 02:56:56.100]  Tell us about yourself, how you found the show, and what you think of winning.
[02:56:57.120 --> 02:57:11.010]  Well, first, if I may take a moment, a couple days ago you had Lara, Logan on, and Larry Pickney two consecutive days, and they both Sung your praises extensively, which was completely appropriate, and I just would like to dovetail on that.
[02:57:11.770 --> 02:57:24.389]  You've made me a lot smarter person, and I don't mean to be obsequious, and it's a big word for sickeningly respectful, but I am sickeningly respectful, and this is a great moment in my life.
[02:57:24.510 --> 02:57:41.120]  I've had children, marriage, great careers, and this is pinnacle right here to be with someone who's Just restored truth and it's just been a big part of my life and I never imagined this.
[02:57:41.399 --> 02:57:43.000]  Wow, this is incredible.
[02:57:44.389 --> 02:57:45.129]  What was the question?
[02:57:45.309 --> 02:57:45.790]  I'm a little nervous.
[02:57:45.850 --> 02:57:48.129]  No, no, Chris, I want to be 100% clear.
[02:57:48.290 --> 02:57:53.909]  I am sickeningly reverent for the listeners because all I want to do is fight the globalists.
[02:57:54.030 --> 02:57:54.610]  They're pure evil.
[02:57:54.809 --> 02:57:55.969]  I don't like being attacked.
[02:57:56.069 --> 02:57:56.809]  I don't like being enslaved.
[02:57:56.809 --> 02:58:00.450]  We have to collectively understand that and come together as individuals to beat them.
[02:58:00.690 --> 02:58:01.829]  So I always say this.
[02:58:01.950 --> 02:58:03.309]  When the listeners thank me, are you kidding?
[02:58:03.750 --> 02:58:04.590]  This is all.
[02:58:04.709 --> 02:58:07.569]  I'm obsessed with liberty, and thank you for keeping me in the fight.
[02:58:07.809 --> 02:58:10.930]  Thank you for listening for many years, and thank you for going to the store.
[02:58:11.209 --> 02:58:12.489]  You're the reason we're here.
[02:58:12.930 --> 02:58:13.610]  It's you.
[02:58:14.229 --> 02:58:15.549]  I understand that completely.
[02:58:15.770 --> 02:58:15.870]  Okay.
[02:58:15.930 --> 02:58:18.909]  Let me tell you, those two guys right over there are incredible.
[02:58:19.190 --> 02:58:21.750]  I just got to know them with texting and phone calls.
[02:58:21.870 --> 02:58:22.870]  Yeah, thanks for harassing me.
[02:58:23.110 --> 02:58:24.430]  Absolutely, that's what we're here for.
[02:58:24.569 --> 02:58:24.670]  Hey, thanks for the opportunity.
[02:58:25.790 --> 02:58:26.629]  They're for real.
[02:58:26.870 --> 02:58:31.909]  For us, it's a good versus evil fight, and we feel blessed to fight with the Infowars team.
[02:58:32.090 --> 02:58:35.850]  And no matter what happens, we're here, and we'll keep Alex around for sure.
[02:58:36.209 --> 02:58:38.229]  Me and Nate are dedicated to that, so thank you.
[02:58:38.329 --> 02:58:40.110]  Nate's even had Lapis come attack his house.
[02:58:40.600 --> 02:58:41.040]  Oh yeah.
[02:58:41.219 --> 02:58:42.420]  And our business, damn it.
[02:58:42.639 --> 02:58:43.639]  They rated our business?
[02:58:43.979 --> 02:58:44.579]  Oh yeah.
[02:58:44.739 --> 02:58:49.299]  Yeah, they rated me for J6 at the office, right in front of the office.
[02:58:49.360 --> 02:58:50.940]  They staked it out for two years, which is crazy.
[02:58:51.219 --> 02:58:57.159]  Then yeah, I had a guy two weeks ago come tear down my Trump sign and cut down my American flag off my property.
[02:58:57.159 --> 02:58:58.879]  And he's the son of a Democrat state rep.
[02:58:58.959 --> 02:58:59.479]  That was a setup.
[02:58:59.700 --> 02:59:00.819]  Yeah, wasn't that crazy?
[02:59:00.959 --> 02:59:02.860]  I think they were trying to get me to do a reaction with that.
[02:59:02.860 --> 02:59:03.219]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[02:59:03.620 --> 02:59:08.379]  But, I don't know, I've become smarter than that over the last two years, I feel like.
[02:59:08.500 --> 02:59:09.540]  I'm kind of retarded.
[02:59:09.579 --> 02:59:13.559]  And tell them for J6, because I've seen someone handed you a shield and you set it down.
[02:59:14.020 --> 02:59:16.360]  Yeah, so- Yeah, J6 was wild.
[02:59:16.540 --> 02:59:24.780]  So the big thing that I'm in trouble for over J6 is there was a riot shield that was passed over the head of a person in front of me and I passed it behind me.
[02:59:24.979 --> 02:59:31.399]  Now I'm convicted of felony civil disorder and felony impeding police and blocking the entrance to a Capitol.
[02:59:31.879 --> 02:59:35.159]  And I thank God every day that President Trump won this election.
[02:59:35.620 --> 02:59:50.379]  And I pray to God that he's gonna free us and free all the rest of the political prisoners from the J6ers to the people that prayed in front of the abortion clinics to Tina Peters who outed election fraud in Colorado to, I mean, shit, Edward Snowden, you go down the line, right?
[02:59:50.600 --> 02:59:50.680]  Yep.
[02:59:50.780 --> 02:59:51.379]  Yep, there we go.
[02:59:51.639 --> 02:59:52.739]  There's the action shot.
[02:59:52.879 --> 02:59:53.680]  Yep, 100%.
[02:59:53.680 --> 02:59:55.819]  And tell everybody what you're facing.
[02:59:56.700 --> 03:00:00.159]  Trump winning literally kept you free, but tell everybody what you're facing.
[03:00:00.389 --> 03:00:10.209]  So five to eight years in prison is what they want for me, while a leftist Antifa protester can go burn down a whole damn city block, and they get their charges dropped, right?
[03:00:10.290 --> 03:00:10.729]  It's crazy.
[03:00:10.969 --> 03:00:12.290]  It's political persecution.
[03:00:12.450 --> 03:00:16.469]  They're coming after people that are against the system, and this is not right versus left.
[03:00:16.569 --> 03:00:19.270]  It's the people versus the establishment, the corrupt system.
[03:00:19.590 --> 03:00:25.370]  And we took a W on November 5th, and Chris took a big W with one in this truck.
[03:00:25.389 --> 03:00:26.590]  It's all positive energy, right?
[03:00:26.750 --> 03:00:30.250]  We just got to keep the positive vibes going, and we got to keep- We've got the initiative.
[03:00:30.370 --> 03:00:31.149]  Yeah, we're winning.
[03:00:31.250 --> 03:00:32.250]  We got the momentum, so.
[03:00:32.750 --> 03:00:34.770]  Chris, you were talking about how you found the show.
[03:00:35.069 --> 03:00:38.690]  I was talking before the show, you're an eloquent guy.
[03:00:39.649 --> 03:00:41.430]  What do you want to talk about here to the millions of viewers?
[03:00:42.489 --> 03:00:42.850]  Wow.
[03:00:44.270 --> 03:00:50.909]  Well, I was telling the gentleman across the table that I think we need to have, how did I phrase it?
[03:00:51.870 --> 03:00:53.090]  Sound mind doctrine.
[03:00:53.430 --> 03:00:53.729]  Yeah.
[03:00:53.829 --> 03:00:55.590]  Well, first, let me say what my dentist told me.
[03:00:55.649 --> 03:01:00.510]  He said we need to have an amendment to the Constitution where we have health freedom and we can reject shots.
[03:01:00.770 --> 03:01:01.530]  Absolutely, I agree.
[03:01:02.329 --> 03:01:03.250]  He's a great doctor.
[03:01:03.909 --> 03:01:10.930]  He's very, but a sound mind doctrine, meaning it's okay if you wanna take drugs and be happy to go out the door and live your life.
[03:01:11.010 --> 03:01:17.510]  But if you are presiding over anyone's future, you need to take a blood test every couple weeks randomly, a blood test, not a urine.
[03:01:18.140 --> 03:01:22.840]  And if you fail for any psychotropic drugs, you're out.
[03:01:23.260 --> 03:01:24.659]  Anyway, that's- That's a good point.
[03:01:24.739 --> 03:01:29.040]  They say something like half of Congress are on speed and antidepressants.
[03:01:29.299 --> 03:01:32.219]  Yeah, there was an article that you put out where I get truth.
[03:01:32.600 --> 03:01:45.340]  And it was a pharmacist in the basement of the Capitol and he said, I'm giving these people strong drugs and they're taking a lot of them and they're making laws and running the government.
[03:01:46.110 --> 03:01:46.989]  And that was alarming.
[03:01:47.049 --> 03:01:48.069]  And then you never heard from him again.
[03:01:48.209 --> 03:01:49.690]  They said, well, let's just quiet that down.
[03:01:49.770 --> 03:01:50.590]  I don't know what happened.
[03:01:50.809 --> 03:01:53.069]  But it's alarming.
[03:01:53.250 --> 03:02:00.659]  And as I was mentioning to you guys in Revelation 18, 23, by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
[03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:05.299]  And if you touch sorceries and get to the concordance, pharmakia, I'm sure this has been gone over many times.
[03:02:05.420 --> 03:02:05.780]  Drugs.
[03:02:06.120 --> 03:02:06.479]  Pharmakia.
[03:02:07.319 --> 03:02:08.739]  Pharmacy is the root word.
[03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:09.819]  Well, exactly.
[03:02:09.979 --> 03:02:11.600]  Sorcery means basically take drugs.
[03:02:11.719 --> 03:02:14.319]  Yeah, so they deceive the entire world there.
[03:02:14.319 --> 03:02:15.299]  So that has taken place.
[03:02:15.299 --> 03:02:19.299]  So the prophecy of the Bible is quite accurate, of course, as you know.
[03:02:19.520 --> 03:02:20.219]  No, you're dead on.
[03:02:20.299 --> 03:02:22.239]  No, I'm glad you raised that because we don't raise that enough.
[03:02:22.739 --> 03:02:23.860]  So tell us about yourself.
[03:02:23.860 --> 03:02:24.559]  You're an interesting guy.
[03:02:24.889 --> 03:02:26.149]  Well, I'm a family man.
[03:02:26.290 --> 03:02:26.809]  I'm retired.
[03:02:27.149 --> 03:02:28.370]  I've had a good career.
[03:02:28.670 --> 03:02:34.649]  And my wife and I, we're gonna be living in Monte Carlo.
[03:02:36.409 --> 03:02:38.989]  But 1979 Monte Carlo, it's up on blocks.
[03:02:39.270 --> 03:02:40.329]  Got a big back seat.
[03:02:40.770 --> 03:02:41.670]  All right, that was a little joke.
[03:02:42.389 --> 03:02:44.170]  No, we're going to now be living in the truck.
[03:02:45.629 --> 03:02:47.329]  All right, thank you for the courtesy chuckle.
[03:02:48.690 --> 03:02:50.889]  I thought you were really moving to Monte Carlo.
[03:02:51.010 --> 03:02:54.149]  I know, it's like a Johnny Cash song.
[03:02:54.510 --> 03:02:58.049]  I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die, so ultimate arrogance.
[03:02:58.489 --> 03:03:02.090]  And when I hear that whistle blow and I hang my head and cry, it's the ultimate humility.
[03:03:02.690 --> 03:03:03.709]  I had my hang.
[03:03:04.979 --> 03:03:09.360]  You go from the finest neighborhood on the planet to homelessness in one verse.
[03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:11.159]  So it's a little humor there.
[03:03:11.340 --> 03:03:18.500]  But no, I live in New Jersey, just saying it for my Jersey people, but I kind of live in a stronghold of wokeism to some extent.
[03:03:19.180 --> 03:03:20.059]  It's hard to say.
[03:03:20.239 --> 03:03:24.620]  You don't really want to have a conversation every day where it can get ugly.
[03:03:24.799 --> 03:03:26.659]  So I don't check people out that way.
[03:03:27.180 --> 03:03:30.440]  We dance around the subject sometimes and sometimes get to truth.
[03:03:31.270 --> 03:03:32.250]  In any case, yeah.
[03:03:32.649 --> 03:03:37.770]  So I was an aviator for my career, and I worked for 34 and a half years.
[03:03:38.069 --> 03:03:38.729]  What'd you fly?
[03:03:38.989 --> 03:03:41.549]  I retired off the 777 International.
[03:03:41.870 --> 03:03:42.290]  Wow.
[03:03:42.590 --> 03:03:44.170]  Yeah, it was exciting, tremendous.
[03:03:44.389 --> 03:03:53.100]  Last great Boeing airplane The engineering masterpiece would fly like 16, 17 hours to India, and it just did everything.
[03:03:53.440 --> 03:03:59.399]  It was back when the Boeing engineers were allowed to be creative, and now everything's become about money.
[03:03:59.520 --> 03:04:03.520]  And prior to that, I had a military career, and I was fortunate enough and blessed enough, it was a high point.
[03:04:03.579 --> 03:04:07.920]  I was an F-16 pilot for seven years, and we did it in an unusual role.
[03:04:08.180 --> 03:04:09.659]  We were an air defense unit.
[03:04:09.659 --> 03:04:11.659]  It was designed as a day VFR fighter.
[03:04:12.040 --> 03:04:20.340]  But we were flying a much older jet before that, the F106 Delta Dart as interceptor pilots out of Atlantic City.
[03:04:20.920 --> 03:04:25.979]  And we would go put eyeballs on Russian planes, which I did once or twice.
[03:04:26.200 --> 03:04:28.959]  But I took some pictures once, and I got on the front page of the newspaper.
[03:04:29.629 --> 03:04:31.270]  I love how cool our listeners are.
[03:04:31.270 --> 03:04:31.870]  He's a badass.
[03:04:32.069 --> 03:04:33.090]  He's a fighter pilot.
[03:04:33.229 --> 03:04:33.729]  Let's go.
[03:04:33.889 --> 03:04:34.469]  I love that.
[03:04:34.870 --> 03:04:35.850]  Yeah, that was a good case.
[03:04:35.930 --> 03:04:36.350]  From New Jersey.
[03:04:36.469 --> 03:04:37.110]  From New Jersey.
[03:04:37.309 --> 03:04:37.829]  Not New Hampshire.
[03:04:37.829 --> 03:04:43.290]  It gave me credibility that I might not really deserve, but I was able to survive the programs, and here I am.
[03:04:43.569 --> 03:04:51.290]  But I mean, I kind of wish I was telling these guys, I wish I'd won this by writing a good essay, but all I did was draw my name, but I'm like, I will take it.
[03:04:51.629 --> 03:04:55.450]  It makes me think, though, imagine how cool all the other listeners are.
[03:04:55.649 --> 03:04:56.469]  Oh, for sure.
[03:04:56.850 --> 03:04:57.889]  The majority are like that.
[03:04:58.290 --> 03:04:58.950]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:04:59.270 --> 03:05:02.889]  Another interesting note too, Chris, you ordered on the first day of the Alex Johnson.
[03:05:02.889 --> 03:05:03.690]  Okay, I saw it, Nate.
[03:05:03.909 --> 03:05:07.030]  September 11th, the launching day, which is awesome.
[03:05:07.190 --> 03:05:08.149]  So thank you for that support.
[03:05:08.190 --> 03:05:09.790]  And I know you guys use a big company to do it.
[03:05:09.889 --> 03:05:10.409]  It's all scientific.
[03:05:10.549 --> 03:05:10.950]  I mean, how?
[03:05:10.989 --> 03:05:11.450]  How does that work?
[03:05:11.569 --> 03:05:12.030]  You were telling me about it.
[03:05:12.030 --> 03:05:12.229]  We do.
[03:05:12.350 --> 03:05:15.110]  We use a third party vendor called Sweepstakes Pro.
[03:05:15.309 --> 03:05:16.530]  So it's federally registered.
[03:05:16.690 --> 03:05:17.709]  It indemnifies us.
[03:05:17.709 --> 03:05:19.030]  So we have to follow the rules.
[03:05:19.250 --> 03:05:21.610]  The rules are pre-made before the date.
[03:05:21.829 --> 03:05:24.969]  So if it's 10X, we decided that before, right?
[03:05:25.049 --> 03:05:25.870]  And put that in the rules.
[03:05:27.829 --> 03:05:32.309]  VIPs, if you're listening, next week, there is a lot of special stuff coming for you guys.
[03:05:32.610 --> 03:05:33.729]  Black Friday, Cyber Monday.
[03:05:33.930 --> 03:05:35.610]  Black Friday, Cyber Monday is coming.
[03:05:35.870 --> 03:05:38.170]  For the best deals on the internet, you know Alex.
[03:05:38.350 --> 03:05:39.950]  He's going to tell you all about his lost leaders.
[03:05:40.170 --> 03:05:44.950]  He's going to be pretty fucking pissed at us next week because we got a lot of good things coming for you guys.
[03:05:45.469 --> 03:05:47.190]  Well, I'm not mad about him getting good deals.
[03:05:47.209 --> 03:05:50.190]  If we sell super tons, then we get money.
[03:05:50.329 --> 03:05:50.770]  Right, right.
[03:05:50.829 --> 03:05:52.870]  But man, I mean, I'm fighting the judge department.
[03:05:53.170 --> 03:05:53.569]  Yep, yep.
[03:05:54.289 --> 03:05:55.370]  That's why Trump won, folks.
[03:05:55.530 --> 03:05:56.229]  You gave him millions of bucks.
[03:05:56.370 --> 03:05:57.090]  I don't need millions.
[03:05:57.090 --> 03:05:59.069]  I need millions, but I'm fighting the same damn people.
[03:05:59.590 --> 03:06:00.989]  And I mean, I'll beg.
[03:06:01.129 --> 03:06:01.930]  All I want to do is beat them.
[03:06:02.030 --> 03:06:02.649]  I mean, what do I got to do?
[03:06:02.729 --> 03:06:11.649]  Because seriously, I tell you, when they said they took over last week, killed the Infowars store, even though they didn't, and they don't own the Alex Jones store, but it hurt it bad.
[03:06:11.809 --> 03:06:18.409]  Explain to people, even if the Onion Weasels take this over, which we don't think will happen because we're fighting them, they're not taking over your company.
[03:06:18.409 --> 03:06:18.930]  It's separate.
[03:06:19.389 --> 03:06:20.010]  Absolutely, yeah.
[03:06:20.129 --> 03:06:22.030]  We are completely separate from Infowars.
[03:06:22.170 --> 03:06:22.989]  We're separate from Alex.
[03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:27.170]  It's thealexjonesstore.com, but they can't shut us down.
[03:06:27.270 --> 03:06:30.270]  I mean, they can come after us and they can do the same thing, but they're not gonna shut us down.
[03:06:30.569 --> 03:06:36.290]  No matter if we've got to go over it, under it, around it, through it, we will accomplish the objective and we're gonna win.
[03:06:37.430 --> 03:06:38.510]  I'm not mad at the listeners.
[03:06:38.690 --> 03:06:40.250]  I just didn't think they'd have to tell them.
[03:06:41.359 --> 03:06:42.299]  Hey, no, no.
[03:06:42.399 --> 03:06:47.120]  The Alex Jones store is for the Alex Jones network and everything else and supporting this, but they can't get it.
[03:06:47.180 --> 03:06:48.059]  They have no claim to it.
[03:06:48.159 --> 03:06:49.100]  I have zero ownership.
[03:06:49.559 --> 03:06:49.700]  Yep.
[03:06:49.879 --> 03:06:51.780]  Yeah, it's completely separate from InfoWars.
[03:06:51.940 --> 03:06:54.139]  If InfoWars shuts down, we are not missing a beat.
[03:06:54.200 --> 03:06:57.340]  We will keep going on the Alex Jones network and the Alex Jones stores.
[03:06:57.639 --> 03:07:01.040]  And I appreciate you guys because, you know, you guys aren't communists.
[03:07:01.120 --> 03:07:02.260]  You got a lot of crew and a lot of people.
[03:07:02.340 --> 03:07:06.280]  You guys really foregoed, you know, some of the profit you'd make because you understand we need it.
[03:07:06.639 --> 03:07:06.959]  100%.
[03:07:06.959 --> 03:07:09.500]  I mean, because all my children, this is not about money, folks.
[03:07:09.620 --> 03:07:15.860]  I am fighting with everything I got right now against really bad people who've promised to put me in prison and threaten me for what I'm doing.
[03:07:15.879 --> 03:07:17.739]  I don't care about getting put in prison or any of that.
[03:07:17.840 --> 03:07:18.420]  I mean, I don't want to be.
[03:07:18.540 --> 03:07:19.600]  But I'm not stopping.
[03:07:19.799 --> 03:07:21.020]  Only you can stop me.
[03:07:21.379 --> 03:07:21.940]  Share the article.
[03:07:22.100 --> 03:07:22.659]  Share the videos.
[03:07:22.799 --> 03:07:23.420]  Pray for us.
[03:07:24.180 --> 03:07:26.360]  Share the links on your email, your text messages.
[03:07:26.559 --> 03:07:27.059]  Share it everywhere.
[03:07:27.219 --> 03:07:30.719]  They hate this broadcast and support us at thealexshowstore.com.
[03:07:30.899 --> 03:07:36.040]  Yeah, there I am last Friday with the sink, just like when Elon came into Twitter and took it over.
[03:07:36.180 --> 03:07:38.600]  I mean, notice they've been real quiet right now.
[03:07:38.780 --> 03:07:39.739]  They don't know what to say now.
[03:07:39.840 --> 03:07:40.680]  Like, you took it over.
[03:07:40.700 --> 03:07:41.620]  Why am I here a week later?
[03:07:41.850 --> 03:07:43.409]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[03:07:43.610 --> 03:07:50.229]  Alex, when you fight back against these people, they go and cower like the cowards that they are, right?
[03:07:50.329 --> 03:07:52.989]  A lot of these people, they talk all this trash, all this shit, right?
[03:07:53.209 --> 03:07:57.750]  But once you confront them and say, like Gandalf in Lord of the Rings, you shall not...
[03:07:57.930 --> 03:07:58.370]  Pass!
[03:07:58.649 --> 03:07:58.709]  Right?
[03:07:58.809 --> 03:08:01.670]  You do that, and it scares them, right?
[03:08:01.750 --> 03:08:03.010]  They run and hide, so.
[03:08:03.329 --> 03:08:04.649]  But you've got to really do it.
[03:08:04.989 --> 03:08:05.350]  100%.
[03:08:05.350 --> 03:08:06.530]  I mean, that's what we've done.
[03:08:06.690 --> 03:08:10.149]  We're like, in fact, we should come back from break with that, with the bulrog chasing him.
[03:08:10.649 --> 03:08:13.569]  Maybe have a minute of it before, and then he stops, and then the bulrog comes.
[03:08:13.889 --> 03:08:15.450]  But notice, he thinks he's done.
[03:08:15.590 --> 03:08:16.350]  He's like, ugh.
[03:08:16.649 --> 03:08:17.729]  It gets him, though.
[03:08:17.829 --> 03:08:17.969]  Yeah.
[03:08:18.149 --> 03:08:19.569]  But he comes back even stronger.
[03:08:19.709 --> 03:08:20.489]  It's all those archetypes.
[03:08:20.649 --> 03:08:23.149]  Like, Trump was Gandalf, got sucked down into hell.
[03:08:23.389 --> 03:08:24.930]  Now he's come back Gandalf the White.
[03:08:25.459 --> 03:08:27.959]  It's the hero's story, or the hero's journey, right?
[03:08:28.120 --> 03:08:31.879]  You know, Trump has come full circle, and I just, you know, I pray these appointments go good, right?
[03:08:32.020 --> 03:08:33.600]  Like, he's doing a great job so far.
[03:08:33.700 --> 03:08:38.440]  But I want to explain something to listeners, because I never think about marketing or, you know, like some plan.
[03:08:38.559 --> 03:08:39.639]  I just think about, how do I think?
[03:08:39.700 --> 03:08:43.200]  Like, if I like something I said, if I think something I said, it turns out the audience is like me.
[03:08:44.510 --> 03:08:48.049]  So there's no, like when the Democrats sued us, when all this discovery, they go, who's telling you what to do?
[03:08:48.229 --> 03:08:49.010]  What's the plan?
[03:08:49.170 --> 03:08:50.709]  There's no planning documents around here.
[03:08:50.790 --> 03:08:52.430]  It's just, what do we think the truth is?
[03:08:52.489 --> 03:08:55.229]  We're not perfect, but we get it right more than almost anybody else.
[03:08:56.990 --> 03:09:00.049]  And I really shouldn't even just plug this, hey, keep me on air.
[03:09:00.229 --> 03:09:02.569]  Folks, this isn't some snake oil.
[03:09:03.489 --> 03:09:11.149]  I mean, CMOS is really recognized as probably the super plant, other than like hemp, and hemp does different things than this.
[03:09:11.709 --> 03:09:25.280]  CMOS has all of these minerals that they say aren't essential, but really are, and the regular minerals, and the way the plant grows it, and then the Powdered caplets are the equivalent of 40 grams of the key ingredients concentrated.
[03:09:25.659 --> 03:09:27.520]  The gummies are the equivalent of 20 times.
[03:09:27.780 --> 03:09:29.260]  So the capsules are even stronger.
[03:09:29.639 --> 03:09:31.100]  I've been gobbling this for months.
[03:09:31.180 --> 03:09:32.200]  That's part of why I'm so healthy.
[03:09:32.340 --> 03:09:33.899]  I've lost weight while my skin's shining.
[03:09:34.079 --> 03:09:36.219]  I mean, this is energy, but it didn't feel like speed.
[03:09:36.540 --> 03:09:37.700]  Great for your whole immune system.
[03:09:37.860 --> 03:09:39.000]  It is magic.
[03:09:39.200 --> 03:09:40.000]  I mean, you think...
[03:09:40.549 --> 03:09:42.850]  You know, the old days they knew spinach was good for you as a folic acid.
[03:09:43.370 --> 03:09:46.610]  Spinach is like cardboard compared to this, nutritionally.
[03:09:46.870 --> 03:09:47.190]  Okay?
[03:09:47.409 --> 03:09:54.229]  It is a superfood, and you guys private label it from one of the top companies, because you said, hey, we're going to go into supplements because you know you want them.
[03:09:54.329 --> 03:09:56.090]  We're talking like months and months and months before you sponsor.
[03:09:56.590 --> 03:09:57.549]  We're about to do it.
[03:09:57.610 --> 03:09:59.370]  And I said, well, here's the places I'd use.
[03:09:59.469 --> 03:09:59.969]  Here's the groups.
[03:10:00.190 --> 03:10:02.969]  All you do is private label already a top brand that it's all certified.
[03:10:02.969 --> 03:10:03.670]  It's already loved.
[03:10:03.770 --> 03:10:04.370]  It's already tested.
[03:10:04.909 --> 03:10:06.610]  Obviously, you test it again because that's the law.
[03:10:06.809 --> 03:10:08.770]  And then we know we're selling them something.
[03:10:08.909 --> 03:10:09.709]  You know, it's like...
[03:10:10.319 --> 03:10:14.899]  It's like selling a brand new Dodge Hellcat and then you just put a different logo on it.
[03:10:14.979 --> 03:10:18.459]  You know it's the Dodge Hellcat or you know it's the Porsche or whatever.
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:24.040]  And so you need CMOS. Even if you don't get it from us, if you get good CMOS, you're gonna be blown away.
[03:10:24.520 --> 03:10:25.479]  Ours is quality.
[03:10:25.719 --> 03:10:26.940]  It keeps us on air.
[03:10:27.309 --> 03:10:30.190]  And at 55% off of three bottles, we're not making much.
[03:10:30.290 --> 03:10:31.590]  The 40%, we make some good money.
[03:10:31.909 --> 03:10:34.750]  But it's competitively priced compared to the best CMOS out there.
[03:10:34.909 --> 03:10:38.350]  You need Ultimate CMOS, and you need to keep us on air fighting these bastards.
[03:10:38.530 --> 03:10:39.750]  Go to thealexchillstore.com.
[03:10:39.750 --> 03:10:40.670]  You will not be disappointed.
[03:10:40.969 --> 03:10:42.010]  We're going to break in a minute, Chris.
[03:10:42.110 --> 03:10:43.950]  We're going to come back and talk more with you guys about the world, the news.
[03:10:44.049 --> 03:10:46.450]  But are you disappointed with your purchase of two T-shirts?
[03:10:47.090 --> 03:10:48.290]  Not at all, not at all.
[03:10:48.709 --> 03:10:55.069]  I was excited about a bug out vehicle, but I was saying, where are you gonna bug out when you're bugging out the tires and the glass melt?
[03:10:55.329 --> 03:10:55.670]  Yeah.
[03:10:55.829 --> 03:11:00.430]  That's where we are, so it's a little beyond alarming that we're dealing with fiendish people.
[03:11:01.600 --> 03:11:02.500]  So there we are.
[03:11:02.620 --> 03:11:08.459]  But the day that they were shutting you down, the bad people, I got a text from Colin.
[03:11:08.659 --> 03:11:11.000]  And it was just a name like you would see, Colin Sanders.
[03:11:11.120 --> 03:11:11.899]  Like, do I know a Colin?
[03:11:12.280 --> 03:11:15.520]  And it said, hey, Chris, this is Colin Sanders of Bigley and Alex Jones.
[03:11:15.700 --> 03:11:17.020]  I was like, yeah, sure, a text.
[03:11:17.139 --> 03:11:17.819]  And I delete.
[03:11:18.139 --> 03:11:19.180]  Then I got another one, delete.
[03:11:19.639 --> 03:11:22.639]  And then later that day, he's like, we're gonna have to move on.
[03:11:22.680 --> 03:11:25.840]  I got a phone, voicemail, phone call, and a text.
[03:11:25.940 --> 03:11:28.520]  And I'm like, maybe I should Listen to the voicemail.
[03:11:28.840 --> 03:11:30.239]  And then I talked to Colin.
[03:11:30.879 --> 03:11:33.239]  That's like people that find the winning lottery ticket later.
[03:11:33.739 --> 03:11:34.780]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:11:34.920 --> 03:11:35.940]  There was that guy in California.
[03:11:35.940 --> 03:11:37.059]  So what did you think when he actually called you?
[03:11:37.299 --> 03:11:38.180]  When you actually talked to him?
[03:11:38.659 --> 03:11:40.459]  I was kind of calm, but it was surreal.
[03:11:40.719 --> 03:11:47.899]  It was like, Yeah, cuz I knew immediately, I clicked back to you saying, well, I saw the day that I saw Nate.
[03:11:48.020 --> 03:11:52.819]  I was like, that's past me, with the hair and stuff, my growing up and so forth.
[03:11:52.959 --> 03:11:56.159]  And I liked him immediately, and I liked- You're like, what's this hippie doing?
[03:11:56.360 --> 03:11:57.639]  No, no, I like- I'm joking.
[03:11:58.180 --> 03:12:01.600]  That's a little secret, the rednecks have had long hair before the hippies.
[03:12:01.700 --> 03:12:02.420]  Hell yeah, we have.
[03:12:02.940 --> 03:12:05.139]  Yeah, what is that Charlie Daniels song?
[03:12:05.860 --> 03:12:06.940]  Long hair country boy.
[03:12:07.059 --> 03:12:07.520]  Yeah, long hair country boy.
[03:12:07.520 --> 03:12:09.399]  Leave this long-haired country boy.
[03:12:21.639 --> 03:12:28.180]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:12:28.219 --> 03:12:30.120]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:12:32.670 --> 03:12:39.290]  My fellow patriots, there are a lot of amazing patriot gear, supplements, you name it, at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:12:39.409 --> 03:12:42.930]  But we've now added a whole bunch of other really cool items.
[03:12:43.149 --> 03:12:49.250]  There are a bunch of amazing campaign coins for InfoWars for $17.76.
[03:12:49.850 --> 03:12:53.530]  We're the fight for liberty on the site as low as $9.99.
[03:12:54.069 --> 03:12:56.309]  Some of the challenge coins are $14.97.
[03:12:56.809 --> 03:12:58.430]  They're great fundraisers for us.
[03:12:58.530 --> 03:12:59.809]  They have a lot of weight in them.
[03:12:59.909 --> 03:13:00.750]  They look great.
[03:13:01.090 --> 03:13:07.370]  They're great conversation starters, great gifts, great keepsakes, mementos, and you know that you've supported the InfoWars.
[03:13:07.569 --> 03:13:16.590]  So I want to thank you all for your past support and encourage you now to go to thealexjonesstore.com, our amazing sponsor, that will keep us on air one way or the other.
[03:13:19.840 --> 03:13:20.780]  They're a great sponsor.
[03:13:20.879 --> 03:13:25.280]  They're not owned by me, and the bad guys won't be able to shut down the AlexJonesStore.com.
[03:13:25.379 --> 03:13:30.040]  So go there for the campaign coins and so much more today, and keep me in the fight.
[03:13:30.239 --> 03:13:31.379]  Thank you so much for your support.
[03:13:32.180 --> 03:13:38.819]  Here's the last nine years of President Trump battling the deep state in a nutshell.
[03:14:27.329 --> 03:14:32.389]  I am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Arnor.
[03:14:33.110 --> 03:14:37.370]  The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Uldund!
[03:14:46.870 --> 03:14:49.049]  Go back to the shadow!
[03:14:58.729 --> 03:14:59.190]  Hell no!
[03:15:22.229 --> 03:15:24.629]  We're good to go.
[03:15:30.469 --> 03:15:41.709]  We're good to go.
[03:15:42.920 --> 03:15:43.959]  And understand the urgency.
[03:15:44.239 --> 03:15:44.780]  We will win.
[03:15:44.940 --> 03:15:50.040]  But that means you've got to keep the broadcast and organizations at the tip of the spear on air.
[03:15:50.260 --> 03:15:51.239]  You are the tip of the spear.
[03:15:51.680 --> 03:15:56.200]  Now, getting back to Chris DeLauro, getting back to Nate Hughes, getting back to Colin Sanders.
[03:15:56.440 --> 03:16:02.399]  You can find Nate at RallyNate, and you can find Colin Sanders at Colin J. Sanders on X as well.
[03:16:02.579 --> 03:16:04.239]  And we've got Chris here, the winner.
[03:16:04.559 --> 03:16:06.059]  We got cut off by the break.
[03:16:07.479 --> 03:16:08.600]  Chris, that's an interesting story.
[03:16:09.040 --> 03:16:10.899]  So how long have you been listening to the show?
[03:16:11.239 --> 03:16:14.520]  I don't know, but I think it was well pre-9-11.
[03:16:14.799 --> 03:16:17.219]  Somehow or another I was listening to you pre-9-11.
[03:16:17.659 --> 03:16:21.159]  Or maybe I'm melding with David J. Smith.
[03:16:21.520 --> 03:16:23.620]  You were saying that's how you found me, was the David J. Smith book?
[03:16:23.719 --> 03:16:24.120]  Yes.
[03:16:24.379 --> 03:16:26.079]  Well, no, his shortwave radio show.
[03:16:26.200 --> 03:16:32.040]  And then I just, yeah, I never really tracked when I found you, but I know it's way early on.
[03:16:32.159 --> 03:16:36.309]  And then Yeah, that's something the way my mind clicks.
[03:16:36.450 --> 03:16:37.569]  You have a photographic memory.
[03:16:37.709 --> 03:16:38.110]  Not anymore.
[03:16:39.250 --> 03:16:40.290]  I don't know, I beg you.
[03:16:40.290 --> 03:16:42.930]  It used to be, it used to be, no, no, no, no, still decent.
[03:16:43.370 --> 03:16:48.329]  So how has the world changed since you were in the Air Force?
[03:16:49.670 --> 03:17:01.149]  Well, it's gotten much more, evildoers and seducers have waxed worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived, the second Timothy chapter three.
[03:17:03.079 --> 03:17:06.600]  I think it's just, there's no comparison.
[03:17:07.100 --> 03:17:11.700]  I mean, one of the t-shirts I bought said I miss the America I grew up in.
[03:17:12.139 --> 03:17:13.680]  And then the second one was prophetic.
[03:17:13.899 --> 03:17:16.600]  I said I'm on a government watch list, which is happening today.
[03:17:18.639 --> 03:17:23.059]  I didn't want anything too aggressive that would get me punched randomly because I'm an old guy.
[03:17:23.899 --> 03:17:27.239]  But yeah, it's just changed in every way.
[03:17:27.559 --> 03:17:29.700]  The information war has ramped up.
[03:17:29.780 --> 03:17:33.219]  There's mass brainwashing, mass poisoning.
[03:17:33.639 --> 03:17:38.899]  People are Doing the craziest things.
[03:17:39.299 --> 03:17:42.780]  And people don't, they self-censor too, people.
[03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:45.159]  They don't want the truth, generally speaking.
[03:17:45.379 --> 03:17:47.899]  And so, cast not your pearls among swine.
[03:17:48.059 --> 03:17:52.420]  At some point, you try to get to people.
[03:17:53.129 --> 03:17:54.190]  What was that verse again?
[03:17:54.290 --> 03:17:54.790]  Because that's key.
[03:17:54.950 --> 03:17:56.530]  I remember reading that years ago in the Bible.
[03:17:57.489 --> 03:17:58.510]  Deceiving and being deceived.
[03:17:58.729 --> 03:17:59.010]  That's the thing.
[03:17:59.129 --> 03:18:03.510]  That's 2 Timothy chapter 3. The whole chapter is very short, but it's, yeah.
[03:18:03.909 --> 03:18:06.909]  This know also in the last days, perilous times shall come.
[03:18:07.569 --> 03:18:09.930]  For men shall be, and it goes on.
[03:18:10.030 --> 03:18:10.930]  I could read it off my phone.
[03:18:10.989 --> 03:18:11.709]  All the terrible things.
[03:18:11.950 --> 03:18:12.530]  It's happening.
[03:18:12.709 --> 03:18:13.450]  And it lists them.
[03:18:13.610 --> 03:18:15.309]  And then, so the verse was...
[03:18:15.780 --> 03:18:23.180]  You know, evildoers and seducers will wax, become, I mean, wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
[03:18:23.579 --> 03:18:28.920]  And so- That's the thing about people that get into evil, they deceive people, and it's like a mind virus.
[03:18:29.100 --> 03:18:30.360]  They're then easy to deceive.
[03:18:30.459 --> 03:18:32.360]  They're all deceiving each other in the back.
[03:18:32.479 --> 03:18:38.260]  It was like there were three factions possibly working to remove Biden, and they were all deceiving each other.
[03:18:39.989 --> 03:18:43.409]  At some point, it doesn't work out well for him.
[03:18:43.790 --> 03:18:45.190]  It gives you a headache.
[03:18:45.909 --> 03:18:46.930]  Yeah, it gives you a headache.
[03:18:47.629 --> 03:18:51.309]  When do we think the woke mind virus started taking over, in your opinion, Chris?
[03:18:51.729 --> 03:18:52.610]  In the Garden of Eden.
[03:18:53.129 --> 03:18:53.729]  Makes sense.
[03:18:54.110 --> 03:18:54.309]  Yeah.
[03:18:54.530 --> 03:18:55.430]  You're exactly right.
[03:18:55.770 --> 03:18:56.790]  Yeah, wow.
[03:18:57.590 --> 03:18:58.610]  When were you in the Air Force?
[03:18:59.409 --> 03:19:05.329]  My last day was February 29th, 1996. So I gave him two weeks notice prior to that.
[03:19:05.530 --> 03:19:06.430]  That was my last flight.
[03:19:06.610 --> 03:19:07.489]  That was my Finney flight.
[03:19:08.479 --> 03:19:14.819]  I was down in Panama, and they forced me to go on a deployment, and it wasn't really technically legal.
[03:19:15.079 --> 03:19:19.899]  But anyway, I was working concurrently with the airline, and I had a couple little kids.
[03:19:20.120 --> 03:19:26.000]  And I was like, yeah, this is becoming too much, too big of a demand on my life.
[03:19:26.280 --> 03:19:29.620]  And so I let that go and stayed with the airline.
[03:19:29.840 --> 03:19:34.879]  Although now, I see friends that I don't know them anymore, but they became generals.
[03:19:34.879 --> 03:19:38.190]  I'm like, Well, that was their thing.
[03:19:38.389 --> 03:19:39.790]  That's just the way it worked out.
[03:19:39.950 --> 03:19:41.430]  But that wasn't a bad career.
[03:19:41.590 --> 03:19:44.430]  I'm thinking that was probably my best job, although the airline was good.
[03:19:44.670 --> 03:19:52.329]  But the airline management, and I don't want to say anything because my son's an airline pilot for the same company, but say anything too diabolical.
[03:19:52.469 --> 03:19:59.969]  But they've kind of go in the direction of Boeing where Boeing is just putting forth products before they're ready.
[03:20:00.450 --> 03:20:07.370]  Whereas, like I was saying, the 777, they would say to the engineers, just apparently they would say, just make it perfect and let us know when you're done and take about seven years.
[03:20:07.889 --> 03:20:11.909]  And that all transpired back when Frederico Pena, was he under Obama?
[03:20:12.989 --> 03:20:15.690]  He said, we'll not let another startup carrier fail.
[03:20:15.809 --> 03:20:17.149]  And so there was JetBlue.
[03:20:17.559 --> 03:20:23.700]  And they were an all-European fleet, subsidized by the EU. So they were pumping in European airplanes, undermining our economy.
[03:20:23.819 --> 03:20:27.319]  And they, from conception to production, were three and a half years, half the time of Boeing.
[03:20:28.120 --> 03:20:30.340]  And there were so many other things that went into it.
[03:20:30.479 --> 03:20:34.600]  So they undermined our economy, they undermined Boeing, and- Undermined air quality.
[03:20:34.979 --> 03:20:37.860]  Yeah, and so- Well, here's an example, a big article out today.
[03:20:39.059 --> 03:20:45.780]  There's a whole class of these really, obviously, we now know dangerous We're good to go.
[03:20:57.860 --> 03:20:59.079]  And that's what they're doing.
[03:20:59.819 --> 03:21:01.879]  It's just, build airplanes that don't work.
[03:21:02.020 --> 03:21:03.180]  Build, make drugs that kill.
[03:21:03.260 --> 03:21:04.559]  I mean, they just don't give a damn anymore.
[03:21:04.659 --> 03:21:07.579]  It's like, it's a green light to just run around screwing everybody.
[03:21:07.879 --> 03:21:13.979]  Who would want to be a powerful, rich person in a world where you screw everybody as if it doesn't blow back on you?
[03:21:14.059 --> 03:21:17.680]  And I look at different globalists statistically, and I know people that know them, and I'm...
[03:21:17.989 --> 03:21:20.190]  They have the highest rates of suicide in their kids.
[03:21:20.430 --> 03:21:21.969]  They're all super mentally ill.
[03:21:22.510 --> 03:21:25.209]  Almost all the globalists, like half their sons are trans.
[03:21:25.709 --> 03:21:29.129]  I mean, they, like you said, they're on a bunch of drugs themselves.
[03:21:30.329 --> 03:21:31.750]  The elite is insane.
[03:21:32.090 --> 03:21:39.350]  Men of corrupt minds, that's in that 2 Timothy chapter 3. So a corrupt, if something becomes corrupted, it's irreversibly damaged, apparently.
[03:21:40.069 --> 03:21:43.389]  I mean, they're men of corrupt minds that are making these decisions.
[03:21:43.569 --> 03:21:44.450]  So can they be redeemed?
[03:21:44.530 --> 03:21:45.049]  I don't know.
[03:21:45.960 --> 03:21:49.899]  And evil people think if you don't do evil, squirrely, weird stuff, you're dumb.
[03:21:50.139 --> 03:22:04.639]  No, I understand the evil, and I love being straight up, because the more you do it, your brain works faster and better, because it's not thinking of squirrely stuff, it's going directly what's the most accurate, what's the most truthful, what's the most honorable, and then you get blessed.
[03:22:06.700 --> 03:22:07.100]  100%.
[03:22:07.100 --> 03:22:10.000]  It's weird how these people think being evil is smart.
[03:22:10.360 --> 03:22:13.520]  I mean, if you're positive and you raise your vibes, right?
[03:22:13.760 --> 03:22:23.739]  If you're positive, if you give, do daily affirmations, if you have the mindset of love, joy, respect, give honor, appreciation, you lower that ego.
[03:22:24.059 --> 03:22:25.020]  I mean, good things come to you.
[03:22:25.159 --> 03:22:25.819]  Look at you, Chris.
[03:22:25.940 --> 03:22:26.899]  You're a great guy, right?
[03:22:26.899 --> 03:22:27.680]  Look what God's done.
[03:22:27.899 --> 03:22:29.799]  You weren't a DEI hire back in the day.
[03:22:29.840 --> 03:22:31.100]  I don't even think they did that then, right?
[03:22:31.620 --> 03:22:32.540]  It might have been.
[03:22:32.620 --> 03:22:33.000]  I don't know.
[03:22:34.520 --> 03:22:38.180]  No, but God rewards those that diligently seek him.
[03:22:38.379 --> 03:22:39.299]  And I was joking with these guys.
[03:22:39.459 --> 03:22:40.700]  I said, what does he reward them with?
[03:22:41.200 --> 03:22:41.639]  Trucks.
[03:22:42.079 --> 03:22:43.920]  No, but the truth.
[03:22:44.559 --> 03:22:47.180]  The truth is the greatest reward because what does it do?
[03:22:47.280 --> 03:22:48.139]  It sets you free.
[03:22:48.399 --> 03:22:50.079]  And you've achieved that freedom.
[03:22:50.340 --> 03:22:54.180]  You are under such duress that it's unimaginable.
[03:22:54.579 --> 03:23:05.479]  But you just precisely continue to fight back and it's- What's the Bible verses about God's, the Psalms, God's prepared a place for me in the midst of my enemies?
[03:23:06.530 --> 03:23:08.309]  Oh, that's in the 23rd Psalm.
[03:23:08.530 --> 03:23:08.850]  Yes.
[03:23:09.090 --> 03:23:09.549]  He prepares.
[03:23:09.829 --> 03:23:10.030]  Yeah.
[03:23:10.969 --> 03:23:11.569]  23rd Psalm.
[03:23:11.629 --> 03:23:12.350]  And I read that now.
[03:23:12.489 --> 03:23:17.049]  It's like the widow's might, too.
[03:23:17.149 --> 03:23:17.930]  And I get it.
[03:23:18.489 --> 03:23:20.290]  It's a real football game.
[03:23:20.370 --> 03:23:21.889]  It really matters.
[03:23:21.989 --> 03:23:22.649]  I'm like a football game.
[03:23:22.930 --> 03:23:26.969]  God always keeps it, though, like we're literally one point ahead.
[03:23:27.350 --> 03:23:29.809]  It's like God always is like, nope, I'm not going to make it easy.
[03:23:29.850 --> 03:23:30.889]  And now I can see why.
[03:23:31.069 --> 03:23:31.690]  But it's...
[03:23:32.110 --> 03:23:34.090]  Yeah, we become arrogant, I think.
[03:23:35.049 --> 03:23:37.450]  We're fallen creatures, and we've got to be careful.
[03:23:37.670 --> 03:23:38.510]  And I think complacent.
[03:23:39.030 --> 03:23:39.690]  Complacent, yeah.
[03:23:40.250 --> 03:23:47.370]  Because the attacks and the urgency, and just how evil these people are, has been my most valuable life lessons.
[03:23:49.030 --> 03:23:54.510]  It's literally, it's like taking a sword in the smith and beating it for six months to make a really powerful sword.
[03:23:54.750 --> 03:23:58.270]  It's hot, it's painful, but you're a sword at the end of it.
[03:23:58.960 --> 03:23:59.659]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:23:59.819 --> 03:24:01.959]  I haven't actually done that, so I can't speak at that.
[03:24:02.260 --> 03:24:04.059]  Well, I have a blacksmith here, but I've read about it.
[03:24:04.360 --> 03:24:05.840]  My dad blacksmiths are some of the hobby.
[03:24:05.940 --> 03:24:07.940]  But the point is, I'm just saying- Yeah, it's a great analogy.
[03:24:08.100 --> 03:24:08.280]  Yeah.
[03:24:08.620 --> 03:24:08.799]  Yeah.
[03:24:09.600 --> 03:24:10.579]  It's wild, though.
[03:24:10.780 --> 03:24:19.639]  So with your Air Force military background and all that, I mean, what do you make of the encroachment of NATO and Russia, Russia testing the ICBM and getting through the missile defenses?
[03:24:20.159 --> 03:24:22.860]  And then Lloyd Austin saying, oh, it's a bluff.
[03:24:23.280 --> 03:24:24.520]  They don't have any good weapons.
[03:24:25.360 --> 03:24:30.260]  Well, I think there's people that aren't suitable mentally for the positions they're in.
[03:24:30.659 --> 03:24:41.899]  And I don't, I mean, thank God for men like Bigley, obviously you, and all the listeners, as you mentioned, that are fighting back.
[03:24:42.100 --> 03:24:51.440]  But there are people that aren't corrupt minds, but it seems like there's a weird human nature aspect that people gravitate to power that aren't quite stable.
[03:24:52.349 --> 03:24:56.950]  And then there are some good ones that gravitate, and they get attacked.
[03:24:59.750 --> 03:25:03.489]  But now, the question was in the military, what did you ask me?
[03:25:03.549 --> 03:25:05.610]  Just what's your take on where we are militarily?
[03:25:06.049 --> 03:25:09.250]  I mean, I think hands down it's the most dangerous time in history where we are.
[03:25:09.469 --> 03:25:12.670]  I feel we're probably, I haven't studied that aspect.
[03:25:12.670 --> 03:25:15.950]  I'm not privy to what everything is and where they're located.
[03:25:16.110 --> 03:25:26.309]  But I think we're unprepared Mentally and logistically on a really frightful level.
[03:25:26.989 --> 03:25:31.010]  But it's God that will give us victory if he chooses.
[03:25:32.090 --> 03:25:33.829]  Exactly, there's no doubt.
[03:25:35.450 --> 03:25:40.049]  And I've studied all the military postures and then the numbers.
[03:25:41.409 --> 03:25:45.110]  And there's lots of lying on both sides, both hiding stuff and then exaggerating stuff.
[03:25:45.270 --> 03:25:45.850]  Both goes on.
[03:25:45.969 --> 03:25:48.190]  But that's why it's mutually destroyed destruction.
[03:25:48.309 --> 03:25:51.909]  That's why there's, you know, a hundred times the nukes on both sides that are needed.
[03:25:52.290 --> 03:25:56.489]  Because even if half of them don't work or 80% get shot down, everybody's still dead.
[03:25:56.889 --> 03:26:01.850]  So it's just, that's why it's, I mean, we could destroy the earth over and over again, folks, by the late 60s.
[03:26:01.989 --> 03:26:05.750]  So people saying, oh, we could have a survivable nuclear war and stuff, they are full of it.
[03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:06.860]  And it's not just Russia.
[03:26:06.959 --> 03:26:11.579]  The minute Russia goes into nuclear war, their allies, China and others, it's total commitment.
[03:26:11.940 --> 03:26:14.180]  And then India and Pakistan start killing each other.
[03:26:14.319 --> 03:26:14.860]  It's not good.
[03:26:15.200 --> 03:26:15.399]  Yeah.
[03:26:15.879 --> 03:26:17.299]  What was your guess there?
[03:26:17.420 --> 03:26:22.260]  You had to clip 72 hours, 72 hellish hours to have.
[03:26:22.379 --> 03:26:27.700]  And that's three days of just all hell breaking loose.
[03:26:28.540 --> 03:26:30.520]  But that describes fervent heat.
[03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:32.479]  I mean, I don't know.
[03:26:32.899 --> 03:26:34.520]  Matthew 24 talks about the end of time.
[03:26:34.579 --> 03:26:37.159]  It also talks about Nineveh, and they got 100-year reprieve.
[03:26:37.260 --> 03:26:40.719]  So maybe what you're spearheading, you're the tip of the spear.
[03:26:41.360 --> 03:26:43.459]  Well, whatever God wants to do, God's gonna do.
[03:26:43.579 --> 03:26:47.799]  But God tells us to be here and occupy, so I'm just gonna do my job.
[03:26:47.879 --> 03:26:50.860]  But yeah, I'm gonna try to stop World War III. I really like living.
[03:26:51.079 --> 03:26:51.440]  Yeah.
[03:26:54.189 --> 03:27:00.569]  It's really frustrating to look at my children, and they're 22, 20, 16, and seven.
[03:27:01.229 --> 03:27:03.569]  But man, looking at the little one, it just pisses me off.
[03:27:03.790 --> 03:27:05.430]  I'm just like, these people are crazy.
[03:27:05.649 --> 03:27:05.969]  Yeah.
[03:27:06.229 --> 03:27:07.010]  I agree completely.
[03:27:07.549 --> 03:27:12.690]  And they're just ushering in their own servitude, slavery, whatever you want to call it.
[03:27:12.969 --> 03:27:16.389]  But oppression has been the order of the day throughout most of history.
[03:27:16.690 --> 03:27:20.850]  And the liberty that was created here in this country was amazing.
[03:27:22.560 --> 03:27:22.960]  Amazing.
[03:27:22.960 --> 03:27:24.219]  That's why we gotta fight for it.
[03:27:24.420 --> 03:27:25.739]  We squandered it, of course.
[03:27:26.120 --> 03:27:37.100]  If I had to say anything to the listeners, I would say, as just an average Arkansan who loves my country, loves God, I'm counterculture because I love my family, I love God, and I work my ass off, right?
[03:27:37.200 --> 03:27:38.540]  And I don't expect free things.
[03:27:39.040 --> 03:27:47.920]  But if you just step up locally, step up at your gym, step up to your barista and just ask her if she likes not having her tips taxed.
[03:27:48.139 --> 03:27:53.940]  Or ask a guy in the sauna if he would be okay with me sitting next to his 12-year-old daughter.
[03:27:54.280 --> 03:27:59.639]  Start having these conversations that are brave, that like you said, you're a little scared to speak up in New Jersey.
[03:27:59.799 --> 03:28:05.100]  But I would challenge you on the local level intimately to start just bringing things up that you agree with.
[03:28:05.799 --> 03:28:10.139]  Die on your shield inside, on your morals, and live on them, right?
[03:28:10.819 --> 03:28:12.500]  Don't be scared to tell people about God.
[03:28:12.659 --> 03:28:14.559]  Don't be scared to tell them chicks don't have dicks.
[03:28:14.860 --> 03:28:15.819]  Proudly say it, right?
[03:28:16.340 --> 03:28:20.180]  If you know your truth, everyone listening, if you do that, it'll make a tide.
[03:28:20.360 --> 03:28:23.760]  It'll really start a change in this country from the ground up.
[03:28:23.940 --> 03:28:24.860]  Courage is contagious.
[03:28:25.280 --> 03:28:25.459]  Yeah.
[03:28:25.979 --> 03:28:27.120]  Wear the hat, too.
[03:28:27.340 --> 03:28:30.440]  You wear the Trump hat, they will melt in front of you.
[03:28:30.659 --> 03:28:34.799]  You wear the Trump hat, and you see, you can tell when someone doesn't like when you're wearing the hat, right?
[03:28:34.879 --> 03:28:35.500]  Whether it's the red hat.
[03:28:35.500 --> 03:28:36.319]  It's like truth serum.
[03:28:36.540 --> 03:28:36.819]  It is.
[03:28:37.379 --> 03:28:44.280]  Alex, you look at them in the eyes, and if you hold a little stare for a couple seconds, they immediately look down on that coward, because they're cowards.
[03:28:44.459 --> 03:28:45.260]  Well, let me explain.
[03:28:46.360 --> 03:28:47.379]  I'm not saying, oh, I'm well-known.
[03:28:47.500 --> 03:28:51.020]  I mean, people that have an anemone need to wear the hat or a shirt if they want to experience it.
[03:28:51.120 --> 03:28:54.200]  Or we got other low-key shirts, like you said, that just to meet black-minded patriots.
[03:28:54.299 --> 03:28:55.680]  It's kind of like choose your own adventure.
[03:28:55.920 --> 03:28:58.139]  But being Alex Jones, that's what happens.
[03:28:58.399 --> 03:29:02.899]  And I'll be walking down the hiking bike trail, and people are walking by a dog.
[03:29:02.979 --> 03:29:03.680]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[03:29:03.700 --> 03:29:05.639]  Most people that recognize me are listeners.
[03:29:06.799 --> 03:29:11.180]  So freedom is way more popular than it is negative, even in a place like Austin, supposedly deep blue.
[03:29:11.840 --> 03:29:16.139]  But when you see the lepers, they'll go, and then they'll look down like you said.
[03:29:16.620 --> 03:29:17.260]  Yeah, they will.
[03:29:17.719 --> 03:29:18.520]  It's the craziest thing.
[03:29:18.520 --> 03:29:20.459]  They used to say stuff, now they just look down.
[03:29:20.639 --> 03:29:21.260]  They're cowards.
[03:29:21.299 --> 03:29:23.659]  And all you have to do is look at them in the eye and say, how are you?
[03:29:23.879 --> 03:29:26.799]  Just kill them with kindness and love, which is what we believe, right?
[03:29:26.959 --> 03:29:28.100]  And truth.
[03:29:28.840 --> 03:29:31.879]  Sometimes they'll go, F you and your family, and I just go, are you on your 10th booster?
[03:29:32.120 --> 03:29:32.620]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:29:33.739 --> 03:29:34.059]  Literally.
[03:29:35.059 --> 03:29:35.680]  That's funny.
[03:29:35.920 --> 03:29:36.540]  It's true, though.
[03:29:36.719 --> 03:29:37.159]  I mean, it's true.
[03:29:37.280 --> 03:29:38.100]  Courage is contagious.
[03:29:38.319 --> 03:29:44.799]  If people just stand up and draw the line in the sand, I know there's a lot of people that don't have a voice because they work for a woke corporation.
[03:29:45.200 --> 03:29:47.059]  Back home, it's Walmart, Tyson, J.B. Hunt.
[03:29:47.159 --> 03:29:47.979]  Nothing wrong with them, right?
[03:29:48.139 --> 03:29:50.079]  But woke corporations have woke ideals.
[03:29:50.200 --> 03:29:57.120]  You have the DEI, you have the ESG, which I'm thankful for Robbie Starbuck for exposing a lot of that and getting these corporations to end that, right?
[03:29:57.280 --> 03:30:05.079]  But If you just stand up and draw a line in the sand and say, hey, I'm not taking it anymore, and be courageous, it's very contagious, and you can get other people to do the same thing.
[03:30:05.260 --> 03:30:06.879]  You can change the world and change the culture.
[03:30:08.200 --> 03:30:09.559]  And back to that.
[03:30:10.690 --> 03:30:17.049]  When they, World Net Daily, like 15 years ago, sued and got the Clinton papers.
[03:30:17.829 --> 03:30:30.610]  And in it, even before they're in office, when he's president-elect, they're like, we gotta shut down conservative and Christian and populist businesses and churches and magazines and newspapers and these guys that are making underground movies.
[03:30:31.010 --> 03:30:39.229]  Because this stuff is so popular already, if people ever figure out supporting conservative or populist or nationalist media, it will take over.
[03:30:39.329 --> 03:30:40.110]  Well, look, that happened.
[03:30:40.639 --> 03:30:45.899]  And so now we're actually in the dominant position only when it comes to actual viewers and listeners, the patriots.
[03:30:46.059 --> 03:30:50.840]  The globalists love all the money and the propaganda and a lot of the courts, but they're losing that.
[03:30:51.000 --> 03:31:02.379]  So when people shop with the AlexShoneStore.com or just mom and pops or local businesses, I mean, I think people Should start sticking a Trump flag in their business and let the people that don't want to go there go there.
[03:31:02.520 --> 03:31:09.700]  I bet you in almost even blue areas you'll get more business because the Trump supporters are the majority and they want to support.
[03:31:09.899 --> 03:31:13.000]  So I like it when leftists say no Trump people in this business.
[03:31:13.159 --> 03:31:15.680]  I mean, I wish they would all do that so I can stay away from them.
[03:31:16.079 --> 03:31:16.399]  100%.
[03:31:16.399 --> 03:31:26.280]  There's a local butcher shop back home in Fayetteville where I get, you know, whether it's, we usually buy a cow, but if it's chicken or something else, I go in there and I go in there and I'll wear my red MAGA hat and I get a lot of compliments.
[03:31:26.459 --> 03:31:27.280]  So it's like, well, you know what?
[03:31:27.479 --> 03:31:28.799]  I'm not shopping at Walmart anymore.
[03:31:28.840 --> 03:31:29.979]  I'm not shopping at Whole Foods.
[03:31:30.100 --> 03:31:31.879]  I'm not shopping at any of the other chains, right?
[03:31:31.940 --> 03:31:33.319]  I'm going to support my local business.
[03:31:33.420 --> 03:31:42.540]  If you support local businesses, small business in general, whether it's the Alex Jones store, whether it's, you know, the local meat market, whatever it is, if you support local and support people that support you.
[03:31:42.680 --> 03:31:44.059]  And then it grows that market.
[03:31:44.159 --> 03:31:45.100]  And it lowers the prices.
[03:31:45.360 --> 03:31:49.059]  You grow that ecosystem of like-minded people and like-minded businesses.
[03:31:49.059 --> 03:31:58.280]  And I know most listeners get that, but I wanted to really sink in that the first mission of the Clintons was, they did it with the IRS and stuff, don't let the people have their own ecosystem.
[03:31:58.860 --> 03:31:59.500]  Look at us.
[03:31:59.579 --> 03:32:00.239]  We're winning.
[03:32:00.340 --> 03:32:01.620]  We're winning the culture war.
[03:32:01.780 --> 03:32:04.520]  You have NFL players doing the Trump, right?
[03:32:04.639 --> 03:32:05.620]  When's the last time that happened?
[03:32:05.719 --> 03:32:15.100]  Oh, they thought in their own congressional hearings and stuff eight years ago, They said if we can shut Alex Jones down, because I was one of the only people at this level doing this, we'll beat them.
[03:32:15.280 --> 03:32:17.059]  Now it's Elon Musk and Joe Rogan.
[03:32:17.940 --> 03:32:18.819]  How crazy.
[03:32:19.059 --> 03:32:22.440]  It's really God is what it is now, and it's too big for them to shut down.
[03:32:22.559 --> 03:32:26.819]  And that's why with this election, the mainstream media died, and so did the deep state.
[03:32:26.979 --> 03:32:29.540]  It might take some slow bleeding out, but we're winning.
[03:32:29.700 --> 03:32:33.920]  So stay brave, stay courageous, and more than anything, live a fact-based life, right?
[03:32:34.139 --> 03:32:35.579]  Call things out for reality.
[03:32:35.780 --> 03:32:36.139]  Don't get...
[03:32:36.770 --> 03:32:39.909]  We're overtaken by the woke mind virus and just be based.
[03:32:41.049 --> 03:32:42.370]  God is real, right?
[03:32:42.469 --> 03:32:46.549]  You can't go outside and look at the sunshine and tell me there's not a God out there, right?
[03:32:46.750 --> 03:32:52.129]  So live a fact-based life, feel courageous to do that, and the world will change for the good.
[03:32:52.489 --> 03:33:06.479]  And I think Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Elon Musk need to- Stand behind you and point out more on a daily basis what has happened to you, the persecution, the lawfare, and just to be more supportive of you.
[03:33:06.559 --> 03:33:11.100]  I know they support you, but- Yeah, I mean, I was talking to- Joe reached out last night.
[03:33:11.970 --> 03:33:14.629]  Actually, I missed his text days ago, and I'm sorry to see your text.
[03:33:14.709 --> 03:33:15.909]  He said, is it true?
[03:33:16.489 --> 03:33:18.350]  They grabbed your building and now you're back in?
[03:33:18.409 --> 03:33:18.989]  I sent him the articles.
[03:33:19.129 --> 03:33:19.969]  He said, this is insane.
[03:33:20.129 --> 03:33:21.309]  So he's going to cover it.
[03:33:21.770 --> 03:33:25.989]  But yeah, Tucker's, I talked to Tucker quite a bit, but lately I haven't because we've all been so busy.
[03:33:26.670 --> 03:33:29.190]  If this was happening to them, I'd definitely be talking about it.
[03:33:29.450 --> 03:33:31.010]  But it's kind of like, it's also a paradox.
[03:33:31.149 --> 03:33:32.590]  People are so used to me being under attack.
[03:33:34.280 --> 03:33:37.159]  I mean, you know, now Trump would have to dodge five bullets for people to carry.
[03:33:37.239 --> 03:33:38.479]  It's like we've been through so much.
[03:33:38.579 --> 03:33:40.180]  He goes, well, you know, those guys will always be there.
[03:33:40.500 --> 03:33:41.819]  No, we won't if you don't support us.
[03:33:43.479 --> 03:33:47.319]  Who's the guy that wrote Nobody Died at SH? I don't even wanna say the name, that's a hot potato.
[03:33:47.559 --> 03:33:48.500]  Was it James Fetzer?
[03:33:48.659 --> 03:33:48.840]  Yeah.
[03:33:49.159 --> 03:33:54.799]  Yeah, so I googled his name years ago, and there was a phone number I called, he answered, he was quite gracious, and we spoke at length.
[03:33:55.040 --> 03:33:56.239]  He said his book is banned.
[03:33:56.540 --> 03:33:57.000]  It is.
[03:33:57.600 --> 03:33:57.920]  Crazy.
[03:33:58.340 --> 03:34:01.739]  Yeah, and they're the guys that questioned it, the Internet, when it was a huge controversy.
[03:34:01.899 --> 03:34:03.399]  I just covered it a few times.
[03:34:04.219 --> 03:34:05.879]  Yeah, what does that tell you when it's banned?
[03:34:06.110 --> 03:34:06.469]  Exactly.
[03:34:06.709 --> 03:34:14.969]  They hired PR firms to just make up all the stuff I didn't do to raise money for the National Violence Policy Center, Brady Group.
[03:34:15.149 --> 03:34:16.649]  Now, Everytown's the new name.
[03:34:16.809 --> 03:34:24.049]  So they've raised money off my name, claimed I raised money off their name, then sued me, rigged the court cases, did all this, and now I'm suing their ass.
[03:34:24.229 --> 03:34:24.409]  Good.
[03:34:24.819 --> 03:34:32.180]  What's even crazier is after, I guess, last week, whenever The Onion was, they were so courageously going on mainstream, which who gives a flying fuck?
[03:34:32.340 --> 03:34:36.940]  They got about half a million views, probably cumulative, and were so proud of just canceling you.
[03:34:37.040 --> 03:34:38.299]  It wasn't for anything else.
[03:34:38.559 --> 03:34:43.819]  And that was, again, I'm just an average American who loves my family and loves God and loves freedom, right?
[03:34:44.000 --> 03:34:45.299]  It was very, very shocking.
[03:34:45.879 --> 03:34:47.079]  Imagine how they feel now.
[03:34:47.319 --> 03:34:47.799]  Yeah, right.
[03:34:48.180 --> 03:34:49.500]  Oh, you bought it, huh?
[03:34:50.220 --> 03:34:50.620]  See?
[03:34:51.340 --> 03:34:53.299]  And you bought it, but Alex is still on air.
[03:34:53.299 --> 03:34:53.719]  And mocked you after.
[03:34:54.459 --> 03:34:57.520]  My lawyers are top lawyers, and they say they never want to say a sure thing.
[03:34:57.840 --> 03:34:59.340]  They've never seen something that's ridiculous.
[03:34:59.579 --> 03:35:06.600]  So when there's finally the evidence you're hearing, I mean, we put these lawsuits that this is criminal.
[03:35:06.979 --> 03:35:09.680]  And we show the U.S. it's cut and dry criminal.
[03:35:10.520 --> 03:35:11.420]  Yeah, it is criminal.
[03:35:12.379 --> 03:35:16.260]  It's like they didn't want the money, even though they, you know, you had the billion dollar judgment, right?
[03:35:16.340 --> 03:35:17.120]  But they didn't want the money.
[03:35:17.200 --> 03:35:18.180]  They just want you shut down.
[03:35:18.299 --> 03:35:19.260]  That's bullshit, right?
[03:35:19.520 --> 03:35:21.920]  And we tried to settle with them.
[03:35:21.959 --> 03:35:23.340]  They said, we don't want money.
[03:35:23.500 --> 03:35:23.719]  Yeah.
[03:35:24.200 --> 03:35:26.940]  So it was, and I just wanted to get, but of course they never were.
[03:35:27.020 --> 03:35:27.559]  So here's the deal.
[03:35:27.680 --> 03:35:30.969]  It's T-A-S. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[03:35:32.170 --> 03:35:33.750]  ADS, Alex Derangement Syndrome.
[03:35:33.969 --> 03:35:35.209]  Yeah, it is.
[03:35:35.430 --> 03:35:37.270]  Well, what it is, they hate God.
[03:35:37.510 --> 03:35:38.709]  They hate anybody standing up for God.
[03:35:39.129 --> 03:35:44.149]  So again, I'm gonna come back, open the phones up, cover all the news, recap breaking stuff.
[03:35:44.409 --> 03:35:48.569]  Isn't it great news that Trump Is having a secret peace summit.
[03:35:48.709 --> 03:35:50.110]  It's now admitted that NATO's there.
[03:35:50.409 --> 03:35:51.290]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:35:51.569 --> 03:35:52.829]  That is such good news.
[03:35:52.969 --> 03:35:54.409]  But the bad guys are going to pull crap.
[03:35:54.610 --> 03:35:56.329]  I'll break down how I think they're going to strike back.
[03:35:56.430 --> 03:35:58.049]  How we stop them next hour.
[03:35:58.309 --> 03:36:01.309]  But I just want to do five more minutes with you guys when we come back here briefly.
[03:36:01.690 --> 03:36:03.229]  But I just also want to encourage listeners.
[03:36:03.829 --> 03:36:05.530]  It's not just about supporting us.
[03:36:06.370 --> 03:36:11.450]  You want to get Ultimate CMOS. It really is the ultimate superfood.
[03:36:11.709 --> 03:36:13.270]  We take an hour to describe it all.
[03:36:13.610 --> 03:36:16.110]  Just take it for a few days and see what you feel like.
[03:36:16.190 --> 03:36:17.149]  Take it for a few weeks.
[03:36:17.350 --> 03:36:18.250]  I mean, I am...
[03:36:19.319 --> 03:36:22.440]  I always take some of the supplements, but now I'm taking them all.
[03:36:22.540 --> 03:36:25.399]  But I'm telling you, the CMOS is insane.
[03:36:25.819 --> 03:36:27.540]  I already knew it was a superfood.
[03:36:27.819 --> 03:36:31.659]  They came to me and said, what about CMOS? I looked it up, and I said, yeah, just get the best source of it.
[03:36:31.719 --> 03:36:32.200]  They said, we already do.
[03:36:32.280 --> 03:36:32.780]  What do you think of this company?
[03:36:32.840 --> 03:36:37.079]  They said, oh my God, that's the top rated, like 4.9 stars, so you put your name on it.
[03:36:37.459 --> 03:36:39.159]  And it's just incredible.
[03:36:39.379 --> 03:36:46.680]  Everybody, for your energy, stamina, libido, immune system, focus, your eyes, your cardiovascular, your blood sugar.
[03:36:47.239 --> 03:36:49.399]  I mean, this stuff is amazing.
[03:36:49.459 --> 03:36:55.659]  And it's the concentrate of the CMOS and several other amazing natural compounds that are also known to do incredible stuff.
[03:36:55.840 --> 03:36:56.780]  It is strong.
[03:36:57.319 --> 03:36:58.239]  Support us.
[03:36:58.459 --> 03:36:59.500]  Try it out.
[03:37:00.309 --> 03:37:07.870]  Go get the Ultimate CMOS. Get one of the fundraiser posters that has big markup in it, because the other products don't, where we actually get some real money.
[03:37:07.950 --> 03:37:15.069]  And if you really want to help us, get some of the collectible limited edition posters all at thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:37:15.149 --> 03:37:20.430]  But we've got the winner of the first big offering, and we're very excited to have him here with us.
[03:37:20.629 --> 03:37:22.129]  And we've got a new truck.
[03:37:22.290 --> 03:37:24.469]  Everybody that spends any money in the store gets entered to win.
[03:37:31.440 --> 03:37:38.100]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[03:37:38.280 --> 03:37:40.479]  You better believe you've got one!
[03:37:42.340 --> 03:37:47.600]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:37:59.400 --> 03:38:06.100]  My dad is chemistry background, also a retired doctor, but he came in to help me run my supplement division 13 years ago.
[03:38:06.540 --> 03:38:07.879]  The deep state sued the hell out of him.
[03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:09.319]  We're going to our guest in a moment, but I gotta do this.
[03:38:09.399 --> 03:38:09.739]  Thank you, sir.
[03:38:10.319 --> 03:38:13.920]  And they basically almost destroyed my parents.
[03:38:14.040 --> 03:38:20.459]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family that my dad was at the edge of bankruptcy himself with all the lawsuits the Democrats filed.
[03:38:20.639 --> 03:38:24.500]  By the way, they said in court that their attorney's fees are $316 million yesterday.
[03:38:25.049 --> 03:38:27.409]  They filed before they've spent $80 million suing me.
[03:38:27.690 --> 03:38:29.229]  We spent $16 million fighting them.
[03:38:29.510 --> 03:38:31.129]  My dad spent $2 million fighting them.
[03:38:31.250 --> 03:38:32.270]  And we're finally winning.
[03:38:32.489 --> 03:38:43.790]  Not only does my dad's supplement company, drjonesnaturals.com, have some of the best supplements, it is a personal request I ask you to support him because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[03:38:43.989 --> 03:38:46.430]  He was giving everything to InfoWars.
[03:38:46.569 --> 03:38:53.969]  And then personally going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me because that's how dads are.
[03:38:54.370 --> 03:38:55.489]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[03:38:55.649 --> 03:39:00.510]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office.
[03:39:00.690 --> 03:39:01.750]  And I got pissed.
[03:39:02.370 --> 03:39:09.510]  So, it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day, and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[03:39:10.139 --> 03:39:11.219]  The supplements are there.
[03:39:11.379 --> 03:39:12.000]  They're great.
[03:39:12.180 --> 03:39:13.360]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[03:39:13.440 --> 03:39:14.700]  He's put everything into it he has.
[03:39:14.799 --> 03:39:15.360]  They're incredible.
[03:39:15.659 --> 03:39:25.319]  I've given so much to this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything, that I don't want to belabor this.
[03:39:25.319 --> 03:39:26.639]  We have important topics to cover.
[03:39:27.440 --> 03:39:28.700]  Please support us.
[03:39:28.899 --> 03:39:30.920]  Go to drjonesdactuals.com.
[03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:31.700]  There's a new sale.

[03:39:48.799 --> 03:39:49.559]  A big sale.
[03:39:49.739 --> 03:39:56.879]  And my dad literally took a loan last week to be able to buy the product that's coming in finally online.
[03:39:56.909 --> 03:39:59.750]  Next week, turbo force, things like that that are popular.
[03:39:59.930 --> 03:40:02.450]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[03:40:03.010 --> 03:40:06.930]  And the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down.
[03:40:07.290 --> 03:40:08.610]  My dad won't stop fighting.
[03:40:08.729 --> 03:40:09.370]  He's a fighter.
[03:40:09.489 --> 03:40:10.350]  Hell, he is my dad.
[03:40:10.510 --> 03:40:11.450]  I think I'm a fighter.
[03:40:11.709 --> 03:40:13.090]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[03:40:13.760 --> 03:40:21.280]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[03:40:21.459 --> 03:40:24.120]  But this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[03:40:24.260 --> 03:40:25.219]  It's about my parents.
[03:40:25.799 --> 03:40:31.340]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's why the enemy targeted them.
[03:40:32.979 --> 03:40:34.819]  Please support the info war today.
[03:40:35.079 --> 03:40:36.920]  Support my mother and my father.
[03:40:36.979 --> 03:40:39.920]  I'm asking you personally for you to do it now.
[03:40:40.139 --> 03:40:42.799]  And at 5% of the millions watching, we go do it.
[03:40:42.920 --> 03:40:44.659]  All our problems will be over in one minute.
[03:40:44.760 --> 03:40:50.280]  But it's less than one half, one percent to ever buy anything from drjonesnagros.com, thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:40:50.360 --> 03:40:53.920]  And for those that do support, thank you for keeping us in the fight for our futures.
[03:40:54.319 --> 03:40:57.600]  So, thealexjonesstore.com, drjonesnagros.com.
[03:40:57.680 --> 03:40:59.200]  I'm going to shut up at the balance of this hour.
