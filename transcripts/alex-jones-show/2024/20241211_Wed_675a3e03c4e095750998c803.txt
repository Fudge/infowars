[00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.950]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.689]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:37.210]  It's our will against the globalists.
[00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:40.729]  It's our choice to be slaves or be free humans.
[00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.729]  It's our choice to join Team Satan or join Team Humanity.
[00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.329]  It is Wednesday, December 11th.
[00:00:51.859 --> 00:01:14.560]  2024. And we are still in the InfoWars studios, surviving since May 31st, in the last seven months, three Justice Department attempts with no court orders or no authority to shut the doors of this operation.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:29.189]  And it is only because of God Almighty Acting and intervening through human agency and free will that we are still here.
[00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.670]  And I thank the listeners and the viewers, the activists for the incredible work you've done keeping us on air.
[00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:49.489]  Now, I have incredibly important news and I am laser focused today and I'm going to go over a ton of it.
[00:01:51.709 --> 00:02:06.890]  But I do hear at the first broadcast with a lot of people tuning in wanting to get my response to what happened last night with the judge overruling the Shanghai attempt, the hijacking operation attempt to shut this facility down.
[00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.650]  And it's a big deal.
[00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:33.360]  Now, I told you back on November 14th when the federal agent Shut the building down that they did not have an order and that it was a repeat of what had happened on May 31st and that the federal judge had gotten rid of the last trustee.
[00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.020]  And I told the crew, we'll be back in a couple days.
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.599]  We were.
[00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.319]  And then the corporate media refused in the last 27 days to ever...
[00:02:49.949 --> 00:03:01.590]  Tell anyone that the judge had said at that hearing on November 14th, at another hearing two Mondays ago, 16 days ago, that the sale did not go through.
[00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:02.810]  Alex Jones is still the owner.
[00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.750]  And they still continue to say they were, that I was a liar.
[00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:16.990]  Well, the Bloomberg company, Global Tetrahedron, financed through his Everytown group that he...
[00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:26.770]  Is the 90 plus percent financier of did take off their Twitter page.
[00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:27.750]  I don't want to pull that up.
[00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:28.650]  We showed it last night.
[00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.430]  It's also on Chase Geiser's action.
[00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.629]  We'll see screenshots of it.
[00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:41.189]  They took down that they were info wars and put a prison cage around the planet where they tell you what they really want to do to you, but also make it a joke.
[00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.969]  Now, that's what's being set up by the globalists.
[00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:48.180]  So they say, look, we're going to enslave you, but it's a joke.
[00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.800]  No, you did try to have a rigged auction.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.139]  You did try to run a scam, and you got caught.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:08.340]  And I don't want to have to go after these people, lawsuit-wise, but we have to.
[00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.050]  Because if you don't, then you're aiding and abetting them to do it to other people.
[00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.430]  They made some big mistakes.
[00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:24.209]  I'm going to lay out this huge First Amendment, freedom of the press, and reprocess victory, and then hit all the other news straight ahead on this live Wednesday, December 11, 2024 transmission.
[00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.370]  Be sure to follow me on XrealAlexJones and at AJNLive.
[00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.209]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.769]  to 3 p.m.
[00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:31.110]  Central.
[00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.050]  I'm here in Central Texas, the Infowars historic embattled studios.
[00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.629]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:04:40.329 --> 00:04:50.149]  And I am, first and foremost, thankful to God for holding us in this position to continue to expose the works of darkness and try to reprove them.
[00:04:50.930 --> 00:05:00.970]  And then, of course, I'm very thankful to all of you, the activists, the men and women in the arena in the information war, and, of course, the crew and my family.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.660]  We are all family.
[00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:06.199]  All right.
[00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.420]  If this had happened to anybody else, I'd be covering it today.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.740]  And I'm going to cover it now for maybe 15, 20 minutes.
[00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:16.759]  And then I'm going to move on.
[00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:26.439]  Because we've got a lot of global news, political news, economic news, global government, casual society news, big moves there.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.139]  That's the key to their takeover.
[00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:30.540]  I mean, that's the change going on, sweetheart.
[00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.910]  And the whole house of cards, the pedophile rings coming down, more arrests, more indictments.
[00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:45.410]  Tom Homan back saying, we're in 39 days, and we are going after the human traffickers and the NGOs and the government officials that were part of this.
[00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:48.149]  We're going to find the 325,000 missing children.
[00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.170]  I mean, it is on.
[00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:54.509]  It is on like Donkey Kong.
[00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.050]  We have got so much to hit here today.
[00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:05.149]  And I was sitting there before I went live writing the headlines for X and Infowars.
[00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:17.689]  But I'm going to also add some other statements to the links I'm going to send out on X at Real Alex Jones and at AJN so people know what we're talking about.
[00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.029]  I had meant to go with this headline.
[00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:22.930]  That's the most important thing.
[00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:26.120]  In my view, to focus on today.
[00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:31.459]  And then I started thinking about our First Amendment, freedom of the press, due process victory, and I wrote the headlines about that.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.079]  Could we pull up real Alex Jones?
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:41.959]  And major victory for freedom of the press and due process, federal judge blocks the Bloomberg-backed attempt by The Onion to shut down Infowars.
[00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:47.459]  Alex Jones is live on air right now, breaking down exclusive details of the historic ruling and other major news.
[00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:53.300]  And that's great, but I can't send it out myself right now, so the crew take dictation and send this out.
[00:06:54.219 --> 00:07:02.800]  Because this is going to be the big thing I'm going to start with in the news at the bottom of the hour after we cover what's happening with Infowars that's important to a lot of people, including the bad guys.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:19.500]  And that is Trump's new national security advisor, and I've already been told this privately, and we've talked about it, but now I'm seeing this from his other cabinet picks, is saying, look, when we say enemy within, about Congressman Waltz,
[00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:25.680]  Waltz, Waltz, We're not talking about the American people.
[00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:29.079]  We're talking about globalist operatives that are trying to sabotage the country.
[00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:32.079]  The enemy within wants to cut our fuel and energy off.
[00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:33.560]  The enemy within wants to implode our borders.
[00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:34.819]  The enemy within wants to human traffic.
[00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:36.600]  The enemy within wants to devalue the dollar.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.060]  The enemy within is at war with the people.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:50.519]  And he came out and said, look, these Democrats, like Adam Schiff, are the enemy within, and we intend to prosecute them.
[00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.529]  They've committed a lot of crimes.
[00:07:53.949 --> 00:07:55.930]  And we list them.
[00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:56.569]  We will list them.
[00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.910]  So, we didn't start the fight.
[00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:06.410]  We didn't do all this to the minions of the system.
[00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:12.750]  They charged and harassed and sued and demonized and surveilled and censored.
[00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:17.910]  Massive numbers of patriots, not just here but around the world.
[00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:19.730]  Patriots to humanity and freedom.
[00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:29.490]  And they've tried to intimidate us and drive us into submission, and they're on top of us, and they've committed a lot of crimes.
[00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:40.830]  They have looked and looked and looked and can't find teen humanity members, not just here, but in Australia and in Germany and in the UK and everywhere.
[00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:47.690]  I mean, they've shot dozens of major patriot leaders in Europe just the last year, killed many of them.
[00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:51.019]  Stabbed them, attacked their families.
[00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:56.580]  AFD party leaders get attacked physically all the time.
[00:08:56.799 --> 00:08:57.460]  The police do nothing.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.899]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:09.559]  You've seen Congressman Scalise shot and Rand Paul physically attacked and ribs broken and lungs punctured and just everything else.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.639]  They are the violent ones.
[00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:14.799]  They commit 99% of the political violence.
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.820]  And now they're gearing up for big political violence.
[00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:28.350]  When Trump gets in in 39 days and in framing him saying he's going to kill the migrants and kill the black people with no evidence of that because they're going to false flag it.
[00:09:28.429 --> 00:09:28.909]  That's obvious.
[00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:38.549]  And that's one of the big tracks they've got to try to stop our reformation of this tyranny.
[00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:48.940]  So that's a big area I'm going to be getting into because We have a responsibility to prosecute these people.
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.940]  Or they're going to continue to do what they've been doing.
[00:09:53.019 --> 00:10:00.700]  If they would just leave and the Globals would just go somewhere else, it'd still be mean to wherever they went to let them go feed on those folks.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:09.159]  But if they would just disappear and go away, it'd be better for everybody than to go through this long, protracted fight.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.460]  But they're not going to go away.
[00:10:11.139 --> 00:10:12.340]  And they're not going to stop.
[00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.250]  Until we stop them.
[00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:21.490]  So let's stop playing games and let's say to them, look, you're not offering quarter.
[00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:23.590]  You're not giving quarter.
[00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.090]  We're not going to give it back.
[00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:31.730]  So this is a fight all the way to the end.
[00:10:32.669 --> 00:10:38.870]  And I've told Trump and I've told his advisors, I've said, you just come out and say you're going to come after him criminally.
[00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:40.330]  That's what people want.
[00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:41.269]  It's the right thing to do.
[00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:42.370]  Why men's words?
[00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:45.990]  Why let them turn it around like it's bad for us to do that?
[00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:47.289]  No, it's got to be done.
[00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.070]  And oh, sure, they'll target us more.
[00:10:50.309 --> 00:10:50.509]  Good.
[00:10:51.929 --> 00:10:54.409]  It's good to fight out in the sunshine instead of the dark.
[00:10:56.669 --> 00:10:58.309]  So they want to fight.
[00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.269]  They started a fight.
[00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.250]  They initiated it.
[00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.230]  They drew first blood.
[00:11:02.289 --> 00:11:03.370]  They started it.
[00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.789]  They're the bad guys.
[00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.649]  And so I like our odds.
[00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:11.909]  Just taking the gloves off.
[00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:13.529]  I don't like our odds.
[00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:14.629]  That's how we win.
[00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:20.610]  It's been playing games with these people where they tell us to compromise, but they never compromise.
[00:11:21.129 --> 00:11:23.009]  We're getting pushed back to the edge of a cliff.
[00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:24.629]  Just go back another foot.
[00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:26.289]  Compromise.
[00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:27.149]  We move back another foot.
[00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:28.330]  No, another foot.
[00:11:28.549 --> 00:11:29.230]  Another five feet.
[00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.850]  And we're at the edge of the cliff, and they've never moved back.
[00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:32.950]  They've never backed off.
[00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.049]  They've never moved an inch.
[00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:39.610]  Because they feel insulated from their bullying criminal actions.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:49.980]  Well, we got a choice, go over the edge of the cliff and take our civilization and children over it with us, or we can do what must be done.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:12:00.539]  Well, as for me and my house, they declared war on us, and I've accepted the challenge, because there's nowhere to go but to fight.
[00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:04.320]  And that means spiritually, economically, culturally.
[00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:09.120]  And we're stronger, we're smarter, we're better.
[00:12:10.299 --> 00:12:12.039]  It's not even a matchup.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:22.879]  We're orders of magnitude stronger than them, smarter than them, but we just sit back and abdicate our responsibility and just hand it over to them.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.700]  So, I'm not going to sit here and live on my knees sucking on their boots.
[00:12:30.039 --> 00:12:36.000]  So, all over the place, the new Trump administration said, yeah, your crooks were coming after you.
[00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:51.830]  And there's all the videos of Schiff, that disgusting pencil neck pumpkin head, and all the crowds he's committed, I'll go over some of them here coming up at the bottom of the hour, saying, oh, we're going to prosecute all the Republicans, we're going to put them all in prison, we've got to get them,
[00:12:51.929 --> 00:12:52.429]  it's the right thing to do.
[00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:58.490]  Now he's like, oh, it's so political and illegal to go after us, no one should go after anybody and charge anybody.
[00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.330]  And he's yesterday like, I don't want a pardon, that makes us look guilty.
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.860]  Well, you committed a lot of crimes, Buster.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:22.700]  You used government funds along with Hillary to pay for fake dossiers framing a U.S. president and heavily involved in the crossfire hurricane waging war against the people's president.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.940]  That's treason.
[00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:30.120]  And you created the fake January 6th committee and got caught putting fake documents in.
[00:13:30.259 --> 00:13:31.440]  You know, they had me in front of the committee.
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:32.759]  Of course, they destroyed all that video.
[00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:34.279]  Destroyed that hearing.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.740]  People said, why'd you take the fifth?
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.000]  That's self-incrimination.
[00:13:39.299 --> 00:13:45.019]  No, it's because they'll set you up and say you lied to Congress by saying you lied when you didn't.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.980]  And I said, I'm not going to declare executive privilege because I wasn't in the White House.
[00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:51.039]  It's how they put Bannon in prison.
[00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:52.460]  You know, right thing to do.
[00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:53.360]  He did have executive privilege.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.639]  But I said, with me, I'm not answering any of your questions.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:01.120]  I said, because Adam Shipp is a criminal who's already been caught putting fake documents and fake emails and editing stuff.
[00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:02.799]  And I gave examples to the committee.
[00:14:03.179 --> 00:14:11.100]  And I said, so I'm not going to respond because you are not a duly We're good to go.
[00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:19.759]  We're good to go.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.139]  We're good to go.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.379]  It's not just the right against self-incrimination.
[00:14:28.539 --> 00:14:32.539]  It's also the right to keep your mouth shut when you're in a fraudulent star chamber.
[00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:34.019]  And I said, that's it.
[00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:35.620]  I basically said that exactly.
[00:14:35.799 --> 00:14:37.179]  I said, I'm done talking to you.
[00:14:37.259 --> 00:14:39.659]  And I took the Fifth Amendment 98 times.
[00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:51.539]  And they tried to get me indicted.
[00:14:54.659 --> 00:15:12.019]  And it came out in the Washington Post that, to his weird credit, Merritt Garland, this is in the Washington Post, like a 25-page article, two years ago, they said, well, the D.C. District, the main political prosecutors,
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:22.279]  and it's the worst, Southern District of New York's really bad, too, as you know, they said, no, the Attorney General said it's just too political.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.500]  To indict me for January 6th.
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.080]  They were going to try to indict me.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.360]  They were putting Owen in prison.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.039]  He was with me there.
[00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:37.759]  Saying he went in the building.
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:38.179]  Never did.
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.620]  Trying to stop people going in.
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.960]  They had all that video.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.139]  And all of my security people's body cam that we put up the whole thing.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.799]  Unedited online.
[00:15:51.269 --> 00:16:00.190]  And D.C., it was in the Washington Post, it was accurate because I've learned this from my lawyers, went to them and said, yeah, we've got a grand jury ready to indict Alex Jones.
[00:16:01.409 --> 00:16:03.950]  And the Attorney General said, no.
[00:16:06.909 --> 00:16:10.470]  You'll never, even in D.C., get away with that.
[00:16:12.149 --> 00:16:15.769]  And they cited the video of us keeping people going in.
[00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:19.289]  And me telling the cops, get on your loudspeakers, get on your...
[00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:24.620]  PA system that they did turn on that evening that was, you could hear it eight blocks away.
[00:16:25.519 --> 00:16:29.860]  They wouldn't get on it because they were told to stand down and say, leave the building, don't go.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.399]  You've got hundreds of thousands of people, they don't know what's going on.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.539]  Then they open the doors, wave them all in.
[00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:38.779]  They indicted a bunch of those people that just walked between the velvet robes.
[00:16:39.919 --> 00:16:47.379]  The reason I raised that, see I'm already kind of covering it now, I'll get to the bottom of the hour, is this guy's a crook.
[00:16:49.929 --> 00:17:08.390]  And it came out that the committee did recommendations and was coordinating with the Justice Department and got the D.C. District and the U.S. Attorneys ready to indict me.
[00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.549]  They had the indictment ready to be signed by a grand jury.
[00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:16.910]  And finally, at some moment, Merrick Garland went, that's a little too much.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.680]  I mean, I'm not John Gotti, folks.
[00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:26.220]  So, that's just how crooked these people are.
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:33.819]  So, should we sit here when Adam Schiff wanted to put me in federal prison for conspiracy to attack the Capitol?
[00:17:33.859 --> 00:17:36.240]  That's what they were going to charge you with, the Proud Boy stuff.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.119]  Which, they weren't a conspiracy either.
[00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:41.500]  That was never even proven.
[00:17:47.339 --> 00:17:53.059]  And he would sit back at night at his house and feel good about me rotting in a prison knowing I'm innocent.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.339]  Well, guess what, buddy?
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.059]  If I have anything to do with it, you're going to be rotting in prison.
[00:17:57.759 --> 00:18:00.299]  And not because I'll get off on it and have some triumph.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.039]  Oh, you know, Adam Schiff's in prison.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.140]  No, you're a monster.
[00:18:04.279 --> 00:18:05.559]  You're a dangerous tyrant.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.440]  You're a threat to this country and every person in it.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:25.109]  So yeah, I hope and pray your pencil neck pumpkin head with your little bug eyes I mean, I'm not saying Schiff's a pedophile, but if I was going to cast somebody for a movie to play the part of a pedophile that like kidnaps kids and eats them in dungeons or something, I mean, he would be great.
[00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.230]  His sidekick would be like Ryan Stelter.
[00:18:30.069 --> 00:18:34.410]  One of the other people, you know, in the torture dungeon would be Tim Walz.
[00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.769]  But I'm not saying they're pedophiles, I'm just saying they look and act just like them.
[00:18:38.849 --> 00:18:41.849]  I mean, man, they make the skin on the back of my neck crawl.
[00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:43.109]  But I'm sorry, I'm digressing.
[00:18:43.509 --> 00:18:45.849]  I'm being a little mean here, but they are bad people, so they deserve it.
[00:18:48.089 --> 00:18:48.630]  All of them.
[00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.029]  I mean, look at Kamala Harris makes my skin crawl.
[00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:52.690]  Joe Biden makes my skin crawl.
[00:18:52.809 --> 00:18:54.190]  His son makes my skin crawl.
[00:18:54.349 --> 00:18:55.869]  Because they're evil people.
[00:18:56.509 --> 00:19:00.809]  And most of the time, you can judge a book by its cover.
[00:19:01.829 --> 00:19:03.650]  It's like the portrait of Darian Gray.
[00:19:04.009 --> 00:19:05.089]  You can see it.
[00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:24.000]  So, the big takeaway, we need to put that headline out, something like, Breaking Trump's national security advisor, Congressman Waltz,
[00:19:24.319 --> 00:19:51.599]  Michael Waltz, begins naming deep state enemies within as the incoming administration of DJT Prepares to defeat the swamp.
[00:19:52.599 --> 00:19:54.180]  You don't drain the swamp.
[00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:55.299]  It could just be reflooded again.
[00:19:56.599 --> 00:19:58.900]  You defeat the swamp.
[00:20:03.859 --> 00:20:06.900]  So, we'll be hitting that coming up.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.220]  And a lot more.
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.720]  And look, I've talked a lot about this, but I haven't talked about it enough.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.119]  Because people are arguing with me here at the office.
[00:20:17.019 --> 00:20:27.720]  I mean, the crew's informed, so they're not arguing, but some people around here are arguing with me that all these UAVs, these UFOs are aliens.
[00:20:28.059 --> 00:20:29.740]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:33.200]  And they go, look, it looks like a flying saucer.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:40.480]  It's a group of drones flying around in sync, and any moron can look at them.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.279]  Anybody can look at that.
[00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:44.009]  And see it.
[00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.049]  So, why is that happening?
[00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:51.309]  Well, we had guests on years ago.
[00:20:55.349 --> 00:20:57.490]  And we're going to do a flashback of this coming up.
[00:20:57.769 --> 00:21:01.089]  Stephen Greer predicting in the next few years this would start.
[00:21:01.329 --> 00:21:02.170]  And explaining why.
[00:21:02.329 --> 00:21:03.569]  This is a really important interview.
[00:21:03.769 --> 00:21:05.150]  I want to repost this.
[00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:07.210]  Probably not even on my ex account.
[00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:08.650]  Let's get this out.
[00:21:09.609 --> 00:21:21.789]  Top 10. Researcher Stephen Greer predicted current rollout of Project Bluebeam.
[00:21:26.809 --> 00:21:28.210]  What was this, three years ago?
[00:21:31.329 --> 00:21:33.650]  There's a flashback today, but I forget the exact date.
[00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.009]  I'm glad the crew reminded me of this.
[00:21:37.089 --> 00:21:38.069]  This is dead on.
[00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:40.410]  So we got that coming up.
[00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:42.109]  But...
[00:21:44.289 --> 00:21:47.890]  April 22nd, 2021, so three years ago like I predicted, or like I remembered.
[00:21:48.089 --> 00:21:56.670]  Okay, I'm going to do something now.
[00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:00.230]  I'm going to come back into the First Amendment issue, and then I'll get into all that other stuff.
[00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:05.289]  But I wanted to just show you a couple things here that I got.
[00:22:07.589 --> 00:22:10.109]  This is important on a lot of fronts.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:19.559]  And then I'm going to go to break and come back and I'm going to judiciously, in a focused manner, go through all of this.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.299]  Where's my Trump elf?
[00:22:24.279 --> 00:22:25.200]  I steal it.
[00:22:26.119 --> 00:22:28.319]  Those things, I leave it in Harrison's studio.
[00:22:29.619 --> 00:22:34.460]  Listen, the reason you want these supplements is really simple.
[00:22:35.279 --> 00:22:37.200]  They work really, really good.
[00:22:37.359 --> 00:22:41.000]  They make your life a lot better.
[00:22:42.589 --> 00:22:45.990]  And the bad guys absolutely hate this broadcast.
[00:22:51.809 --> 00:22:55.970]  And we're really doing revolutionary things here together on air.
[00:22:57.089 --> 00:22:58.970]  So I make it simple.
[00:22:59.309 --> 00:23:12.509]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com And there is Ultimate Seamoss, Irish Seamoss, which is, just go research it yourself, Irish Seamoss is like the superfood.
[00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:18.069]  Only thing else I can think of that has properties that are just as powerful but in different areas would be like hemp.
[00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.430]  Everybody knows like, ooh, hemp's really incredible.
[00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:26.329]  Everybody knows ginger's amazing, but Seamoss is spectacular.
[00:23:29.849 --> 00:23:32.329]  Somebody's been eating all day, so this bottle's almost empty.
[00:23:33.049 --> 00:23:34.869]  When you get in, the bottle's brimming with them.
[00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:37.349]  Whether it's the capsules, the gummies, they're amazing.
[00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:40.569]  We got big sales going right now.
[00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:53.069]  Do your Christmas shopping at thealexjonesstore.com, and then we can continue the infowars, continue the operation, continue in our legal defense and offense to go after the deep state that's trying to take us off air, and you just saw our victory.
[00:23:54.289 --> 00:23:57.869]  Your victory yesterday in federal court that I'll cover when we come back.
[00:23:58.269 --> 00:23:59.769]  But we're not a normal show.
[00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:01.769]  We're like, this guy's trying to raise money all the time.
[00:24:02.069 --> 00:24:03.750]  We've actually built a media system.
[00:24:03.869 --> 00:24:06.029]  We reached tens of millions of new people a day.
[00:24:06.349 --> 00:24:08.349]  We're kicking ass thanks to you.
[00:24:08.529 --> 00:24:09.650]  This is your success.
[00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:12.930]  But I'm up against Bloomberg and the Democrats and all of them.
[00:24:14.829 --> 00:24:19.470]  And we're defeating them and people are finally waking up to what they did and they're in a lot of trouble.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:35.779]  So now is when we've turned the tide, now is the time to support, but you really want Ultimate CMOS. The new product, Ultimate Turmeric, concentrated in some of the strongest turmeric out there, incredible anti-inflammatory properties, health effects across the board.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.000]  And it's not just turmeric, it's just the name, Ultimate Turmeric.

[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.059]  Very strong, one of the strongest formulas out there.

[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.579]  Trump, 2024. Better coverage than Verizon.

[00:26:34.619 --> 00:26:38.000]  It's the classic InfoWars because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:43.069]  And then we've got the alchemy of the deadly chemical accuracy bending our genders and the frogs' genders.
[00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.769]  The frogs go through the prism and they come out.
[00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:47.250]  Well, you know the rest of the story.
[00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:53.910]  And who can forget the chart that saved President Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania when he turned his head on the right wing of the chart?
[00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:55.609]  Everybody's got to get one of these.
[00:26:55.769 --> 00:26:57.130]  I predict it'll be a bestseller.
[00:26:57.309 --> 00:27:00.990]  Donald Trump reborn as a Jack Daniels bottle.
[00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:02.750]  This is going to be a bestseller as well.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.980]  If you're blown away by these designs, it's just a few of them.
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.119]  There's over 200 designs right now at theallshowstore.com.

[00:27:16.119 --> 00:27:17.220]  Merry Christmas!
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:47.859]  Alright, just while I was on the air the last 30 minutes, a bunch of big news broke, and it's just more confirmations of what we already knew was going to happen.
[00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:53.559]  NATO rained down more attack of missiles on Russian targets.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:06.859]  The Democrat governors are coming out and organizing their preparations to stage civil unrest as a pretext to secede with a race-based conflict smokescreen.
[00:28:08.289 --> 00:28:11.069]  There's a bunch of news as they hype the next plandemic.
[00:28:11.529 --> 00:28:14.490]  Mike Adams is in the third hour to break down all the details of that with us.
[00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:19.490]  This is going to be a very important transmission in the time we have left the next three and a half hours.
[00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:27.890]  But let me get to the big victory on the freedom of the press, freedom of due process situation.
[00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:39.420]  I told everyone that the Justice Department appointed individual, because the feds can intervene in a case, Like it's Enron or something.
[00:28:39.519 --> 00:28:40.180]  Like I'm a crook.
[00:28:41.059 --> 00:28:48.660]  And they've been at the depositions and harassed the snot out of me for the last two years looking for all this hidden money and all these crimes I committed.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:49.599]  Of course I didn't.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:56.779]  And that's all been admitted.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:00.200]  And the judge watched this for the first year and went along with anything they wanted to do.
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.059]  Oh, we want to spend...
[00:29:02.579 --> 00:29:06.440]  Infowars money for an outside accounting firm to come in.
[00:29:06.759 --> 00:29:09.680]  And then they found nothing in six months, so they won another one.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.099]  Then they won another one.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:11.579]  Three.
[00:29:11.779 --> 00:29:13.200]  They had the IRS auditors.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.519]  Mr. Jones overpaid taxes.
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.079]  $4.3 million tax return over four years.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.759]  Of course, that went into bankruptcy, but they started getting really upset.
[00:29:23.799 --> 00:29:27.880]  And the headline, New York Times, turned out he always had meager assets.
[00:29:28.819 --> 00:29:29.299]  Meager.
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.299]  I mean, I wouldn't call it meager, but I didn't...
[00:29:33.299 --> 00:29:37.160]  I mean, don't need to get bigger than a four-bedroom house and a little pool, a small hot tub.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.940]  I like my Ford truck.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.880]  I like my Dodge Charger.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.339]  I'm good.
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.740]  I mean, you can't get me to sell out for money.
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.900]  I don't do this for money.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:50.740]  There's nothing wrong with it.
[00:29:50.779 --> 00:29:54.259]  It's good to have money so you're independent, but, I mean, they want to make us all poor so they can control us.
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.819]  So you heard all that.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.779]  You saw all that.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.779]  Jones is going to prison.
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:58.440]  He's hiding money.
[00:29:58.579 --> 00:29:59.059]  All the news.
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:29:59.839]  Thousands of articles.
[00:30:00.849 --> 00:30:01.750]  Don't send him money.
[00:30:01.849 --> 00:30:02.349]  Don't support him.
[00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:03.210]  He's got plenty of money.
[00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:04.549]  Remember all those lies?
[00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:09.109]  And don't buy supplements.
[00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:10.210]  They're not FDA approved.
[00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:11.470]  1996 law.
[00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:12.390]  The Grass Act.
[00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:19.130]  There is no jurisdiction of the FDA in supplements.
[00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:23.470]  They tried to take it over and Congress passed a law saying you can't take it over.
[00:30:23.569 --> 00:30:24.190]  You have no jurisdiction.
[00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.910]  So they say he has unapproved supplements.
[00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:28.829]  None of them are approved.
[00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.970]  It's not their jurisdiction.
[00:30:32.479 --> 00:30:48.880]  Yesterday, or Monday when the hearing started the investigation, Elon Musk's lawyers were there and they said, you can't have Alex Jones' ex-accounts, but if you get a judge to say you own his old content, we're not saying that you can do that or not.
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:49.700]  That's not our jurisdiction.
[00:30:50.759 --> 00:30:53.140]  People spun that, oh, Musk betrays Jones.
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:57.200]  Musk has no jurisdiction over my content.
[00:30:57.339 --> 00:30:57.940]  That's my fight.
[00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:04.250]  So everything is a spin, a lie.
[00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:13.910]  And then I told you that they tried to shut us down on the 31st of May, and that came out in the hearings later.
[00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:14.630]  People were like, really?
[00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:15.869]  The feds were there without a warrant?
[00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.630]  Yeah, right, Alex.
[00:31:16.869 --> 00:31:18.329]  Why did you stick a camera in their face?
[00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:22.750]  Well, I mean, it's the U.S. trustee.
[00:31:22.869 --> 00:31:24.349]  I mean, they're the ones in the wrong.
[00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:25.930]  I'm not going to get aggressive with them.
[00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:33.450]  In a confrontation, I'm going to get aggressive in court.
[00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:36.109]  I'm going to give them plenty of rope to hang themselves.
[00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:39.650]  Then it came out weeks later in court that indeed they tried to shut us down by an order.
[00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:40.690]  The judge said you couldn't do that.
[00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.970]  And everybody said, oh, he told the truth.
[00:31:42.069 --> 00:31:42.970]  Well, of course I told the truth.
[00:31:44.599 --> 00:31:46.640]  I wouldn't want to lie anyways, but use your head.
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:49.819]  If I lied to my listeners about something like that, my show would be over.
[00:31:50.319 --> 00:31:51.579]  Start making up.
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.059]  The feds are here without warrants trying to shut us down.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:54.900]  That's crazy.
[00:31:55.259 --> 00:31:56.539]  What they did is crazy.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.619]  I know it sounds crazy to say they did it because they did it.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.200]  It's on record.
[00:32:00.359 --> 00:32:05.460]  And then they tried it on November 14th and said they had the auction.
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:06.539]  It wasn't an auction.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.200]  And the judge said it wasn't an auction.
[00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:09.319]  And we've been here since then.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.680]  And I said, I believe the judge will probably do the right thing.
[00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:14.509]  It's the court system on trial here, not me.
[00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:16.890]  And he did last night and said, this is bull.
[00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.630]  No one can understand this.
[00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:21.990]  This is fiat money.
[00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:27.410]  It's exactly what I said to you when this all went down almost a month ago.
[00:32:28.309 --> 00:32:30.150]  So, I told the truth.
[00:32:30.509 --> 00:32:31.930]  I was accurate.
[00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:37.549]  I was faithful to you because I'm faithful to myself.
[00:32:43.289 --> 00:32:44.109]  Remember all the headlines?
[00:32:44.289 --> 00:32:45.390]  He'll soon be shut down.
[00:32:46.869 --> 00:32:49.230]  And then the judge had a two-day hearing.
[00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:54.250]  He went until 10-something at night last night.
[00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:01.650]  And you're not allowed to record, federal court, but we were in here listening to it.
[00:33:03.549 --> 00:33:07.369]  It's on video too, but we weren't on the computer in there, but you can also dial it on the phone.
[00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:13.170]  And I listened to his 25-minute ruling, and I was nervous because he was showing both sides of it.
[00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:18.190]  But then he came back and said, this so-called auction was doomed from the beginning.
[00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:18.750]  That's a quote.
[00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:21.549]  And he just said, this wasn't an auction.
[00:33:23.829 --> 00:33:25.450]  And he changed the rules over and over again.
[00:33:26.869 --> 00:33:30.910]  And if you go over all the stuff they did, I mean, it will literally give you a headache.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:47.940]  And then two times the last week, they changed what they said the winning bid was again, even though they'd already given orders to the judge, or proposed orders, they wanted him to certify the last stuff, because the math they put that was based on fiat made-up money didn't add up.
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:53.859]  I mean, just throw feces on the wall and see what sticks.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.900]  Would be a more effective thing.
[00:33:58.099 --> 00:33:58.519]  So...
[00:34:01.279 --> 00:34:14.420]  The establishment is in really pissed off mode because, I mean, when I say they've run tens of thousands of articles against me over the decades, that's a low number.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.539]  I can't keep track of it.
[00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:27.000]  I get Google alerts, rarely look at it now, but I remember when they first were attacking me intensely eight years ago when Trump was first getting in, I would get Google alerts that would say 27,000 new articles.
[00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:28.449]  In one day.
[00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:32.769]  Now that's AP, and Reuters would do an article, and that would get syndicated everywhere.
[00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:38.989]  Every newspaper, every news site, every TV station that published it, it would show another hit.
[00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:49.670]  But there would be hundreds of articles a day, for years on end, every day, thousands and thousands of local newscasts a month, hundreds of national attacks every month.
[00:34:49.789 --> 00:34:54.349]  I mean, I'd be in a bar, a restaurant, in a hotel, turn the TV on, it'd be me being lied about.
[00:34:55.369 --> 00:34:56.150]  We're under attack.
[00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:56.750]  Help us.
[00:34:56.829 --> 00:34:57.230]  He's coming.
[00:34:57.409 --> 00:34:58.550]  He's sending people to harass us.
[00:34:58.650 --> 00:34:59.889]  He's peeing on our children's graves.
[00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:00.650]  None of it was true.
[00:35:00.889 --> 00:35:06.110]  And raising money for Bloomberg's gun control group, they didn't send out things saying, give us money to take the guns.
[00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:07.130]  It was give us money.
[00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:07.750]  He's attacking.
[00:35:08.269 --> 00:35:09.949]  They attached themselves to me.
[00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:11.690]  They raised money off me.
[00:35:11.909 --> 00:35:21.909]  They exaggerated to the 10th degree, to the 10th power, the few little things I did when the internet didn't believe it happened, and I covered it a few times.
[00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:23.210]  And then years later, they sue me.
[00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:34.650]  And the judges find me guilty and have show trials produced by HBO. This was lawfare to the next level.
[00:35:34.769 --> 00:35:41.369]  And they said on CNN and MSNBC years ago, they said, what we're doing to Joe is a test for Trump and other patriots like Tucker Carlson and Glenn Beck.
[00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:58.599]  MSNBC, CNN both said that with the Democrat operatives on TV. And So I went into federal bankruptcy two years ago saying, well, these state courts,
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:12.659]  this judge shopping they did to do these events, surely, you know, if we go into federal bankruptcy, I mean, I can't believe all the judges are, you know, just bizarrely, grotesquely corrupt.
[00:36:14.119 --> 00:36:33.940]  And I, you know, went and talked to a lot of very respected, you know, top of the line Lawyers that are known for being, you know, really straight-laced, and they said, no, we don't think these federal bankruptcy judges are crooks.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.079]  You're going to get a lot better shaken there.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.079]  And Judge Lopez hadn't done me any favors the last two years.
[00:36:41.159 --> 00:36:46.300]  I mean, he said that when he got rid of the last trustee in the CRO on June 14th.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:58.099]  He said, you've had two years in all these investigations that Against Mr. Jones, and you never brought a claim, never brought a suit, never brought anything he did after you said he did all this stuff, and that's when he turned on him.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.059]  And just stopped believing everything.
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:09.300]  I mean, yesterday, when they'd be saying stuff, he'd say, oh, yeah, well, I'm sure, I'm sure you.
[00:37:10.099 --> 00:37:11.199]  Yeah, yeah, right.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.179]  Yeah, I'll take your word for it, but I'm still not going to.
[00:37:15.639 --> 00:37:17.000]  I'm still going to want to see that proof.
[00:37:18.059 --> 00:37:18.960]  To everything they said.
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:19.960]  And they would go, oh.
[00:37:21.159 --> 00:37:23.199]  He'd say, yeah, so let me, show me.
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.619]  I mean, I take your word for it, but just go ahead and show me.
[00:37:26.719 --> 00:37:36.340]  Because they go in there and they lie and they lie and they lie and they lie and they put in fake filings over and over and over.
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:37.420]  I mean, they put in filings.
[00:37:37.739 --> 00:37:40.739]  Mr. Jones is hiding 69 million dollars.
[00:37:43.719 --> 00:37:47.159]  They hadn't even examined our books yet two years ago.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.440]  And my lawyers were like, do you got $69 million?
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.059]  I said, no, here's my books.
[00:37:52.199 --> 00:37:52.539]  They're like, yeah.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.260]  They had outside, my own people didn't believe me.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.159]  We got to hire outside accounting firms.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.159]  And they said, listen, we want to go all the way here.
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.199]  I'm hiring an outside group.
[00:38:02.239 --> 00:38:04.280]  We're going to search your house and all your storage facilities.
[00:38:05.239 --> 00:38:06.219]  I said, here's the keys.
[00:38:06.239 --> 00:38:06.800]  I'm going to be at work.
[00:38:12.739 --> 00:38:14.320]  Because they knew the Justice Department was involved.
[00:38:14.539 --> 00:38:15.699]  They weren't saying they were going to put me in prison.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:24.159]  And at the end of it, this outside firm said, well, we've collectively been doing this hundreds of years.
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:29.340]  Our company, just our investigators, they said, we've never seen someone tell the truth like you.
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.179]  We've never seen someone so accurate.
[00:38:31.679 --> 00:38:34.739]  We've never seen someone submit to the process like this.
[00:38:36.179 --> 00:38:38.360]  They literally said, you're like a really...
[00:38:40.449 --> 00:38:41.050]  Good person.
[00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:45.570]  We never see businesses of this size that are doing exactly what they say.
[00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:47.369]  Most people just can't help it.
[00:38:47.409 --> 00:38:48.170]  They hide money and stuff.
[00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:50.050]  And I said, they're trying to put me in prison.
[00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:51.469]  Plus, I don't have a bunch of money.
[00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:52.090]  I don't care.
[00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:56.570]  So if they're going to set me up, it's going to be cut and dry.
[00:38:56.610 --> 00:39:01.739]  And I have No fear of that because God's on my side.
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:09.659]  And I said, I have been through rigged trials produced by HBO and the Justice Department and the CIA. It's all come out.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.820]  And I said, they want to put me in prison.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:20.559]  I said, I welcome as many investigators in here as possible to watch their people to make damn sure they don't plant something.
[00:39:24.179 --> 00:39:26.519]  And there's a lot of stuff I haven't told you that went on.
[00:39:26.659 --> 00:39:27.760]  It's been wild.
[00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:39.289]  Foreign intelligence agencies, I mean, here, in Austin, paying people to try to break in and stuff.
[00:39:39.389 --> 00:39:40.210]  I mean, it's been fun.
[00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:44.550]  So, can you imagine what it's like for Trump?
[00:39:44.769 --> 00:39:46.409]  I mean, a thousand times worse.
[00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:55.710]  So, but after Trump, nobody's had this concerted attack on them.
[00:39:57.599 --> 00:40:01.920]  But I'm still super ultra junior to that, and I don't want to be anywhere near the attacks he's been under.
[00:40:02.019 --> 00:40:02.940]  I don't want to be under any attack.
[00:40:03.039 --> 00:40:04.039]  But I'm a big boy.
[00:40:04.059 --> 00:40:04.719]  I knew what I was doing.
[00:40:06.139 --> 00:40:07.559]  I mean, I expected to be attacked.
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.460]  Hell, I thought I'd be dead or in prison by now.
[00:40:09.519 --> 00:40:11.860]  I just made the commitment to fight, and whatever happens, happens.
[00:40:12.019 --> 00:40:12.500]  It's up to God.
[00:40:13.039 --> 00:40:13.780]  Give it to God.
[00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:20.030]  But God works through you and it's been your support and your prayer and your word of mouth that's kept us here.
[00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:21.349]  You are everything.
[00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:25.190]  You're the reason we've survived this with some scars.
[00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.010]  But I see them as beauty marks.
[00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:28.289]  So thank you.
[00:40:28.769 --> 00:40:30.210]  You call in thanking me, man.
[00:40:30.269 --> 00:40:31.349]  Hey, I'm in your hands.
[00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:39.929]  I mean, I just, you literally like found me floating around in the ocean about to drown and you hauled me onto your boat.
[00:40:42.539 --> 00:40:50.780]  And then I'm sitting there all freezing wet with a towel, and you're thanking me, and I'm like, well, you got this backwards, sweetheart.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:51.579]  Thank you.
[00:40:52.059 --> 00:40:54.500]  I mean, I literally depend on you.
[00:40:54.659 --> 00:40:56.019]  I am in your hands.
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.719]  You don't support me.
[00:40:59.059 --> 00:41:00.480]  You don't share information.
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.320]  It goes nowhere.
[00:41:02.699 --> 00:41:03.820]  You don't buy our products?
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.119]  We fail.
[00:41:05.519 --> 00:41:06.500]  And you fail too.
[00:41:06.599 --> 00:41:10.239]  And I just want you to understand who is the head of the dog.
[00:41:10.239 --> 00:41:10.960]  I'm the tail.
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.519]  Yeah, I'll keep doing what I'm doing regardless.
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:22.559]  But if you don't boost me, if you don't back me, if you don't stand with me, I don't have one one millionth of the power and capabilities.
[00:41:23.039 --> 00:41:25.139]  You are the info war.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.880]  You have had the victories.
[00:41:27.119 --> 00:41:28.559]  You have had the successes.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:35.230]  You have Think of the other accomplishments in your life.
[00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:37.070]  I'm sure a lot of you have amazing accomplishments.
[00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:38.150]  All of you have great accomplishments.
[00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:42.349]  Think about the accomplishment you've had by supporting this broadcast.
[00:41:42.809 --> 00:41:44.409]  Think about the crew, their accomplishments.
[00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:48.250]  Think about getting Trump in despite all the deep state attacks.
[00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:49.369]  Think about that accomplishment.
[00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:53.909]  Start thinking about the power you've had because you stood up.
[00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:56.750]  Now, let me just finish up and move on.
[00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:59.130]  Here's some of the headlines.
[00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:00.190]  AP, there's thousands of them.
[00:42:00.289 --> 00:42:02.610]  Sale of Alishone's Infowars, The Onion, Rejected.
[00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:06.829]  The Onion's purchase of Alex Jones InfoWars stopped by a U.S. judge.
[00:42:07.409 --> 00:42:09.670]  Judge refused to allow sale of InfoWars to the Onion.
[00:42:10.329 --> 00:42:12.170]  Alex Jones keeps InfoWars for now.
[00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:14.909]  And it goes on from there.
[00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:18.849]  And then you can read the Democrat, former federal prosecutor who specialized in putting innocent...
[00:42:19.619 --> 00:42:22.619]  In my opinion, Republican governors and others in prison.
[00:42:23.079 --> 00:42:32.179]  He says in here, and this Alex Jones celebrates the judge, Rob's bombshell decision on Infowars, controversial sale to Michael Bloomberg's funded onion.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.920]  And then when you get to it, got a picture of the judge, Chris Lopez here.
[00:42:38.119 --> 00:42:43.820]  It's got Chris Maddy, the Fed, a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families who sued Jones of Connecticut.
[00:42:44.519 --> 00:42:55.420]  Said they were disappointed that the judge rejected the onions bid after it was recommended by the trustee as being in the best interest of Jones creditors.
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:15.780]  These families, always the families, who have already preserved and persevered through countless delays and roadblocks, while they fundraised off my name and played victim, saying I did things to them, remain resilient and determined as ever to hold Alex Jones and his corrupt business.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:16.980]  I've never been found to be corrupt.
[00:43:17.139 --> 00:43:17.940]  That's defamation.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.019]  Accountable for the harm he has caused, Maddie Jones.
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:37.639]  It's literally an Eddie Munster lookalike said in a statement late last night the decision doesn't change the fact that soon Alex Jones will begin to pay the debt to these families and he will continue doing that for as long as it takes.
[00:43:38.159 --> 00:43:39.780]  Now what a deceptive statement.
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:47.340]  They go tell this jury that I have hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars that I made it off these people.
[00:43:47.559 --> 00:43:48.679]  Both of that's not true.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:55.280]  And then They refuse a settlement.
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:03.119]  And I told my lawyers, I said, I've never made $70 million in 30 years on air, personally.
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:07.280]  But I said, okay, they want $70 million.
[00:44:07.639 --> 00:44:09.039]  I said, I'll do it over 10 years.
[00:44:10.039 --> 00:44:11.400]  And I said, but watch, they'll reject it.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.119]  And they came out and they go, yeah, actually, they don't want that.
[00:44:13.159 --> 00:44:14.179]  They want $90-something million.
[00:44:14.909 --> 00:44:16.550]  And they want you to control your speech.
[00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:17.489]  And I said, let me guess.
[00:44:17.489 --> 00:44:18.289]  It's not just guns.
[00:44:18.409 --> 00:44:18.929]  There's going to be a list.
[00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:20.070]  Yeah, actually, there's a whole list.
[00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:22.210]  Yeah, they've already done this in private mediation.
[00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:23.809]  And I said, no.
[00:44:24.769 --> 00:44:26.650]  Quote, Tony Montana, fuck no.
[00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:31.409]  And what, I mean, I didn't sell out to the Globals before.
[00:44:31.469 --> 00:44:32.550]  I'm not going to sell out to you.
[00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:42.309]  And so, little grocers for the New World Order, little errand boys, I mean, it's off-record meetings.
[00:44:42.469 --> 00:44:45.369]  I said they were off-record, so there's nothing criminal, so I won't say...
[00:44:45.369 --> 00:44:53.989]  I mean, I've been in the meetings with the big globalists a lot a few times and turned down their loving offers, which aren't loving at all.
[00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:55.949]  It's the carpet of gold or carpet of bombs thing.
[00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:57.670]  Do you think I'm scared of you?
[00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:00.230]  Little small-time Eddie Munsters?
[00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:02.969]  So...
[00:45:02.969 --> 00:45:05.070]  Literal ambulance chasers?
[00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:07.289]  They are royalty of the ambulance chasers.
[00:45:08.409 --> 00:45:08.849]  So...
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:11.840]  Senator Blumenthal runs that.
[00:45:13.019 --> 00:45:15.420]  So, or Blumenthal, excuse me.
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:28.239]  So, they turn down all this money and then run around saying he won't give us our money And they don't want a deal where they get a percentage of money.
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.079]  No, they've said on the courthouse, we want him off the air.
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:32.199]  This isn't about money.
[00:45:32.599 --> 00:45:34.380]  Then they're in the news thinking you're stupid all the time.
[00:45:34.519 --> 00:45:38.300]  He won't give us money, that cheap ass, you know, for our fake...
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.739]  Meanwhile, I have appeals going.
[00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:51.800]  But they were going to pledge my future money they think I owe them that I would never even make a fraction of to pay...
[00:45:53.139 --> 00:45:59.280]  For their takeover of my site to then misrepresent it and steal our identity to confuse people.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.039]  They said that.
[00:46:00.599 --> 00:46:04.659]  I mean, is that not the most villainous stuff you ever heard?
[00:46:06.139 --> 00:46:09.719]  So just remember that, that that's who these people are.
[00:46:10.199 --> 00:46:18.320]  All right, here is a clip from November 14th, the day they tried to throw us out of the building and cut the internet off and all the rest of us.
[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:22.519]  We went to the backup studios of the AJN Network at AJNLime on X. Be sure to follow us there.
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:26.699]  And here's one of the videos I posted at like 11 o'clock at night.
[00:46:28.639 --> 00:46:33.059]  Flashback clip 18. Here it is from November 14th.
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:39.860]  All right, I shot a special report on this that I posted at Red Lock Showns about two hours ago.
[00:46:40.559 --> 00:46:46.900]  And I was actually reading the transcripts from the multi-hour emergency court hearing today in federal bankruptcy court in Houston.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:52.139]  And I called all the lawyers and talked to them, and they had a total consensus.
[00:46:53.119 --> 00:46:54.679]  They've never seen anything like it.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:47:03.079]  The words were exactly, this was a private secret sale, basically illegal is the word that's used, basically.
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:05.579]  Crime.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.559]  I mean, bankruptcy crime.
[00:47:08.739 --> 00:47:09.599]  I mean, on his face.
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:15.000]  Disguised as an auction that wasn't an auction.
[00:47:18.239 --> 00:47:21.219]  And the people didn't even pay real money.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:25.820]  They paid some weird fiat thing that wasn't even agreed to by the judge's order.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:31.360]  And then they had the corporate media say that The Onion bought Infowars.
[00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:37.650]  And then the judge kept saying to the trustee that did this, I didn't give you the authority to do this.
[00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:39.110]  You were supposed to come to me about an auction.
[00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:40.090]  This isn't even an auction.
[00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:46.230]  And then it's just all over the news that they just bought it and they won the bid and they did that.
[00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:50.590]  But then they quote the U.S. trustee going, well, it's not the highest bid, but it's the best bid.
[00:47:51.309 --> 00:47:54.150]  These people just, they didn't do anything.
[00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:55.369]  It's crazy.
[00:47:57.769 --> 00:48:08.489]  So, nobody sees how the federal judge, who's known for being straight-laced and not corrupt at all, Judge Chris Lopez, cannot end this fake sale, which he basically said didn't happen.
[00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:12.510]  He should have an emergency evidentiary hearing sometime next week.
[00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:13.489]  He hasn't announced the date yet.
[00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:17.489]  And bare minimum, there'll be a new open public auction.
[00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:20.909]  Probably more is going to happen.
[00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.750]  I mean, this is unprecedented, folks.
[00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:29.449]  Just like the last trustee he fired back on June 14th, tried to close the building without a court order.
[00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:32.809]  There's a lot of behind-the-scenes deep state goings on here.
[00:48:33.409 --> 00:48:34.650]  And this is a big deal.
[00:48:35.269 --> 00:48:36.369]  I've been up since 5 a.m.
[00:48:36.409 --> 00:48:36.829]  dealing with this.
[00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:37.550]  I'm about to go to sleep.
[00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:44.519]  I'll be covering it all live from the new studios at the Alex Jones Network at AJN Live on X, please follow me there.
[00:48:44.659 --> 00:48:46.679]  But this is going to be big.
[00:48:46.679 --> 00:48:48.579]  Everybody out there thinking M4s were shut down.
[00:48:48.739 --> 00:48:49.860]  You're in for a rude awakening.
[00:48:51.059 --> 00:48:51.960]  Was I right?
[00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:53.719]  Were they wrong?
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:54.579]  Yeah, I was right.
[00:48:54.579 --> 00:48:55.099]  They were wrong.
[00:48:55.179 --> 00:48:55.900]  Thanks for standing with us.
[00:48:57.239 --> 00:49:00.239]  Here's a little bit of the first reaction last night.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:05.940]  I was here at the studios, went live on air, had already been live, right after the judge made his ruling.
[00:49:06.099 --> 00:49:06.340]  Here it is.
[00:49:07.139 --> 00:49:11.139]  Finally, a judge followed the law.
[00:49:13.699 --> 00:49:15.840]  In the lawfare fiascos.
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:22.980]  And ruled in Infowar's favor.
[00:49:25.519 --> 00:49:33.619]  Now, the judge told them 27 days ago, Bloomberg's every town that turned out is the group behind it.
[00:49:34.139 --> 00:49:35.719]  The Onion's their front group.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:40.119]  He told them they didn't know it and he said they need to stop saying that.
[00:49:40.619 --> 00:49:41.900]  They did not stop.
[00:49:45.429 --> 00:49:46.630]  Major cause of action.
[00:49:47.329 --> 00:49:50.730]  And I'm not a litigious person, but they're trying to destroy us and destroy free speech.
[00:49:50.869 --> 00:49:52.409]  So you know what's going to happen to them.
[00:49:53.389 --> 00:49:56.090]  And Michael Bloomberg, Mr. Babyfeet.
[00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:00.190]  Yeah, Bloomberg, we know all about you.
[00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:09.449]  So, I didn't start this fight, but when I say I'm going after the bad guys, I don't mean the front group and these families they use and manipulate.
[00:50:10.289 --> 00:50:11.690]  They're just victims of this process.
[00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:12.730]  I'm talking about the establishment.
[00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:16.369]  So, the judge just ruled in our favor.
[00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:27.769]  You know we put in our filings that we believe a crime has been committed and this should be referred to the Justice Department.
[00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:30.170]  There's a new Justice Department coming in.
[00:50:30.269 --> 00:50:34.429]  I can tell you that they are looking very strongly at this.
[00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:39.010]  They like open and shut cases of bid rigging.
[00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:43.550]  Of price fixing.
[00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:46.710]  And of collusion.
[00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.010]  All three of those are felonies.
[00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:50.409]  You're talking 10 years in federal prison.
[00:50:51.809 --> 00:50:52.769]  All right, we're going to break.
[00:50:52.869 --> 00:50:54.650]  Come back with the World War III news that just broke.
[00:50:54.769 --> 00:50:56.210]  The U.S. is bombing Russia again.

[00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:00.369]  There are three things that don't hang themselves.
[00:52:00.809 --> 00:52:03.969]  Drywall, Christmas tree lights, and Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:52:04.329 --> 00:52:07.010]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in free fall.
[00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:08.989]  Their entire criminal operation is collapsing.
[00:52:09.429 --> 00:52:15.469]  Trump is officially going after the Biden administration for the criminal human trafficking and sex slavery.
[00:52:15.889 --> 00:52:18.750]  We're going to take control January 20th, and people are going to be held accountable.
[00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:20.170]  We're going to be very transparent.
[00:52:20.369 --> 00:52:21.269]  We're going to get behind.
[00:52:21.469 --> 00:52:24.710]  What did the United Nations have to do with the open border crisis?
[00:52:24.889 --> 00:52:26.449]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[00:52:26.559 --> 00:52:30.719]  We're going to be very transparent American people and we're going to tell them the truth what happened on this border.
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.159]  Again, by design.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:33.860]  And so much more is happening.
[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:34.900]  This is an exciting time.
[00:52:35.139 --> 00:52:37.079]  But the globalists are striking back.
[00:52:37.219 --> 00:52:41.159]  That's why it's important to keep our operation on air now more than ever.
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.159]  And we can't do it without you.
[00:52:43.219 --> 00:52:44.119]  So we make it easy.

[00:53:03.769 --> 00:53:05.329]  And I personally love this one.
[00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:09.010]  I'm not usually into wearing a shirt with myself on it, but this one's really cool.
[00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:11.489]  And the family and friends will have so much fun.
[00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:12.789]  It's a great conversation piece.
[00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:14.750]  And this will horrify.
[00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:19.670]  Leftists, and then maybe you can be friendly to them once they are up against the wall shaking and firing and walking on the streets.
[00:53:19.809 --> 00:53:20.369]  Say, it's okay.
[00:53:20.849 --> 00:53:25.449]  Alex Jones doesn't bite, though it kind of does look like I'm Jaws coming up on the swimmer there.
[00:53:25.929 --> 00:53:32.030]  There's so many other great limited edition shirts, hoodies, sweaters right now.
[00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:35.530]  And then, of course, there's the Darth Sidious hoodies.
[00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:37.849]  Trump one, I'm afraid.
[00:53:38.289 --> 00:53:44.969]  While you're there, believe me, If you love our information, you're going to love the supplements like Ultimate Sea Moss.
[00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:46.829]  That is the ultimate superfood.

[00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:44.349]  I'd heard about CMOS being a superfood, our CMOS namely, but the folks immediately say, you're recommending all these supplements and that's great.
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:53.199]  Kind of got your vitaminal fusion with electrolytes, that's hydroforce, and a great gut cleanse, and a great probiotic, and energy gummies, and sleep gummies.

[00:55:00.219 --> 00:55:04.340]  And I looked at it, and I was like, oh my god, this is the superfood other than maybe hemp.
[00:55:04.949 --> 00:55:06.329]  But it does other effects than him.

[00:55:32.349 --> 00:55:34.590]  Pretty dangerous for me and Trump, but we wouldn't be anywhere else.
[00:55:34.769 --> 00:55:37.050]  Thanks for keeping me and President Trump with the fight.
[00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:38.329]  God bless and good luck.
[00:55:38.929 --> 00:55:39.949]  Oh, and I almost forgot.

[00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:45.929]  That's so triggering to the left, but I also love Christmas.
[00:55:46.269 --> 00:55:49.650]  And a Happy New Year with President Trump about to come into office.
[00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:52.610]  The mission is not impossible to bring down the globalists.
[00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.989]  All right.
[00:55:54.429 --> 00:55:55.409]  This is a short little segment.
[00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:56.670]  It's important news right now.
[00:55:56.809 --> 00:56:00.329]  And then when we start the next segment in six minutes, all the stations join us.
[00:56:00.449 --> 00:56:01.690]  I don't care the first five.
[00:56:01.889 --> 00:56:06.610]  I'm going to get into the huge political developments that are so important.
[00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:09.550]  The Democrats doing what I told you they would do.
[00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:14.329]  Getting ready to create civil unrest and try to secede and drive Trump from power.
[00:56:14.469 --> 00:56:15.250]  They're not going to give up.
[00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:19.530]  And top Trump administration officials saying, well, we're just going after them.
[00:56:19.690 --> 00:56:20.630]  They're enemies within.
[00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:22.329]  Not the people, the globalists.
[00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:24.210]  So they've got to be stopped.
[00:56:25.389 --> 00:56:26.630]  We'll get to those clips.
[00:56:27.489 --> 00:56:31.469]  New Tom Homan clips confirming they're going to find the missing kids and prosecute the bad guys.
[00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:36.690]  The United States bombing Russia again today and more.
[00:56:39.849 --> 00:56:44.570]  And then I'm going to get into these UFOs that they're trying to act like are aliens.
[00:56:45.639 --> 00:56:48.619]  And the fact that this is the soft rollout of Project Bluebeam.
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:49.920]  Here's a short clip.
[00:56:50.019 --> 00:56:51.019]  We'll get to more of it later.
[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:53.760]  Three years ago with Dr. Stephen Greer predicting all of this.
[00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:54.219]  Here it is.
[00:56:55.159 --> 00:56:59.320]  There's a new video this morning that some say may be proof we're not alone in the universe.
[00:56:59.619 --> 00:57:04.559]  A UFO in the form of a bright light is seen descending over the dome of the rock in Jerusalem.
[00:57:05.039 --> 00:57:06.940]  The video is said to be taken over the weekend.
[00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:10.320]  Then suddenly the light shoots up into the sky.
[00:57:10.579 --> 00:57:11.119]  There you see it.
[00:57:11.179 --> 00:57:14.360]  Another video from a different angle appears to show the light doing the same thing.
[00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:31.829]  This seems potentially like one of the biggest stories of my lifetime.
[00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:35.250]  And I don't care if it's about UFOs or whatever you call it.
[00:57:35.369 --> 00:57:41.110]  Something that we don't understand is getting very close to our military aircraft and the government isn't responding adequately.
[00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:42.889]  And I hope you keep sounding the alarm on this.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:53.000]  I think it will take congressional hearings to get to the bottom of all this.
[00:57:53.099 --> 00:57:57.179]  This is the next big thing that they want the public to be afraid of.
[00:57:59.179 --> 00:58:09.920]  Well, they fired this electromagnetic weapon, they collided, two went down near Roswell, and one wasn't found until 1951 up in the northern New Mexico desert.
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:33.880]  Everyone wonders why this conservative Republican president named Five Star General Eisenhower said on his last speech to the nation as he left office, beware the military industrial complex.
[00:58:34.099 --> 00:58:40.280]  We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought.
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:43.239]  By the military industrial complex.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.760]  He wasn't talking about his brethren in the military.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.340]  No, he said a technological elite in control of it.
[00:58:48.639 --> 00:59:00.440]  We must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite.
[00:59:00.739 --> 00:59:10.380]  People don't realize that Eisenhower, on his watch, Lost control of the technology transfer issue around ET spacecraft.
[00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:13.340]  They circled the wagons and cut him out.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:23.380]  So that's where I get into the Majority Intelligence Committee, MAJIC. It's pronounced magic, ironically, or not ironically.
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:27.619]  And that is a blend of both corporate and government programs.
[00:59:27.619 --> 00:59:29.380]  And I've met with a number of them.
[00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:32.130]  Who are involved at that level.
[00:59:32.409 --> 00:59:38.530]  And they all have this agenda to want to control the world through one calamity after another.
[00:59:38.829 --> 00:59:44.170]  And the big one they've been planning is to host sort of an alien threat from outer space.
[00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:47.309]  You know, Wernher von Braun back in the 70s...
[00:59:47.449 --> 00:59:51.610]  All right, that's just part of his report three years ago that we've added a lot of clips and video to.
[00:59:51.969 --> 00:59:56.889]  The full thing's being posted right now on Real Alex Jones on X. It's free to all of you, belongs to you.
[00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:59.289]  Everything I've ever done is free to the world.
[00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:02.429]  That's why even the bad guys were ever able to actually take this place over.
[01:00:02.769 --> 01:00:07.030]  We're going to devastate them in court because it's all been published to the world and free to everybody.
[01:00:07.429 --> 01:00:12.630]  And so other shorter clips of that are also going up on Real Alex Jones here in the next 10 minutes.
[01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:13.710]  So be sure and share those.
[01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:14.710]  Those belong to you.
[01:00:14.889 --> 01:00:16.110]  They've always belonged to you.
[01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:16.989]  They belong to the people.
[01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:18.570]  It's beyond fair use.
[01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:20.750]  It is an open, non-exclusive license of the world.
[01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:24.469]  Everything I do here on air belongs to you.
[01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:27.349]  And the scumbags can burn in hell.
[01:00:28.050 --> 01:00:30.650]  Well, I too, spreading out their propellers tonight.
[01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:36.510]  That's all these government, deep state DARPA drones flying around harassing everybody.
[01:00:37.329 --> 01:00:40.570]  Yep, they're rolling out Project Bluebeam, the fake alien invasion.
[01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:41.789]  I'll get to that later in the hour.
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:57.599]  And they've rolled out World War III, and they are rolling out the civil unrest, race war, smokescreen, for an attempt to launch a civil war.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:02.800]  But Trump knows what's going on, and he's moving to counteract it as we speak.
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:06.880]  Breaking news on that front, and so much more this hour.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:11.280]  Then the New World Order move with a bunch of fake plandemics.
[01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:17.690]  We'll do the deep dive on that with the latest information in the next hour in T-53 minutes.
[01:01:18.969 --> 01:01:19.670]  All right.
[01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:37.510]  So, as you know, the White House gaslighter, the Secretary of Gaslighting, KJP,
[01:01:39.519 --> 01:01:42.940]  Came out and announced, oh, $50 billion to Ukraine.
[01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:47.460]  Doesn't matter that the Speaker of the House has killed $24 billion.
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:53.179]  As Trump puts pressure, not even an office yet, for 39 days on Zelensky.
[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:59.119]  Zelensky told him on the weekend in Paris at the Notre Dame reopening that we're not going to stop the war.
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:02.199]  We're going to continue to escalate it.
[01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:05.219]  You've seen NATO and Israel and Turkey overthrow Ukraine.
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:19.159]  Syria, you hand it over to Al-Qaeda, you see the NATO overthrow of the election, the canceling of the winter in Romania, and you've seen the civil war that's starting in Georgia, and a lot more is coming.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:24.860]  So they've decided to escalate what's already World War III into something much worse, potentially nuclear.
[01:02:26.179 --> 01:02:33.719]  And today, in the last hour and a half, the United States started bombing Russia again with attack of missiles.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.940]  We're going to go over that first.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:49.559]  But here is KJP. And kind of like the Bloomberg Everytown Onion Company called The War Is Over.
[01:02:49.659 --> 01:02:50.760]  That's the name of their consortium.
[01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:51.699]  We learned the documents.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.900]  Just came up with this funny money thing that nobody ever heard of.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.260]  Never in bankruptcy, never in court.
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:58.039]  It's a new thing.
[01:02:58.719 --> 01:03:01.340]  My money in the future to buy my company.
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:14.019]  So they use my money that doesn't exist and their fake rulings on appeal to buy my company and shut it down.
[01:03:17.539 --> 01:03:19.019]  And the judge said no.
[01:03:23.619 --> 01:03:25.599]  They couldn't even tell him what the winning bid was.
[01:03:25.659 --> 01:03:26.599]  He said, is this a joke?
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:39.969]  It's very rare to have a federal judge override a Justice Department trustee It's happened twice, actually three times, since May 31st.
[01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:43.949]  May 31st, they tried it.
[01:03:44.829 --> 01:03:46.769]  November 14th, they tried it.
[01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:52.610]  And they tried it again on Tuesday, December 10th, yesterday.
[01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:59.030]  So, strike one, strike two, strike three, you're out.
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:02.260]  Now the judge has him on a very short leash.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.019]  So I have time later.
[01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:03.760]  I'll get into that.
[01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:07.199]  And what is the future of M4? There's a lot of different moving parts there.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:10.340]  But let's just say this.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.679]  Things aren't going too well for the Democrats.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.639]  And that's just a canary in the coal mine microcosm.
[01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:17.139]  But back to...
[01:04:18.589 --> 01:04:20.849]  Congress is supposed to fund wars, and they said no.
[01:04:21.969 --> 01:04:33.889]  And so, oh, we're going to say that the Russian asset derivatives, which they don't even have most of these assets, they just say these assets don't belong to you, even though most of them aren't even in the United States, and most of them are in Russia.
[01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:39.610]  The State Department just says, we own all these Russian companies now, according to that, around the world.
[01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:42.929]  So those Russian companies have trouble operating around the world, but they don't have the assets.
[01:04:43.989 --> 01:04:44.690]  It's sanctions.
[01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:50.170]  In the globalist social credit score, ESG, even against countries.
[01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:56.869]  Because the Russians, you know, won't let them cut the little Russian boys' penises off.
[01:04:57.010 --> 01:05:00.269]  That's the big litmus test, literally.
[01:05:01.769 --> 01:05:05.969]  And so they're like, well, we just, 50 billion.
[01:05:08.849 --> 01:05:11.010]  We just pledged this made-up money.
[01:05:12.869 --> 01:05:17.130]  And then whatever they can scrape together, you know, goes right back to the Democrats.
[01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:20.889]  So they're just stealing everything, including the kitchen sink.
[01:05:33.369 --> 01:05:36.750]  So let's go ahead and go to the press secretary.
[01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:37.250]  Here it is.
[01:05:38.659 --> 01:05:42.260]  The United States and G7 are now making good on that commitment.
[01:05:42.599 --> 01:05:55.579]  Together, we will leverage income earned from frozen Russian sovereign assets to provide a total of $50 billion of extraordinary revenue, acceleration, ERA loans to Ukraine.
[01:05:55.579 --> 01:06:00.579]  This will lend vital support to the people of Ukraine as they defend their country.
[01:06:00.579 --> 01:06:08.480]  And it also makes clear aggressors and tyrants will be responsible for the damage they cause.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.360]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:31.909]  Netanyahu on Saturday when Israel took the Golan Heights said that they were doing it for the security and now they've gone deeper into Syria just 24 kilometers from the capital Damascus and Turkey's taking a bunch to the north and Netanyahu said,
[01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:45.989]  well, we've got to have a buffer zone for our security in case whoever takes over, which is Al-Qaeda that Israel openly funded and admits, along with Turkey and NATO, that's CNN. Oh, this guy's former head of Al-Qaeda, but it's okay.
[01:06:46.769 --> 01:06:49.670]  It's in the Israeli papers that Israel funded him, one of the big groups.
[01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:53.269]  But it's okay when Israel does it, so I guess, you know, it's loving.
[01:06:54.530 --> 01:06:54.929]  And...
[01:06:56.989 --> 01:06:57.489]  There it is.
[01:06:57.590 --> 01:06:59.250]  U.S. hypocrisy reaches a new level.
[01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:02.150]  Israel's occupation of Syria is security.
[01:07:02.329 --> 01:07:04.369]  Russia's moves in Ukraine are aggression.
[01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:13.309]  Oh, my God.
[01:07:13.449 --> 01:07:15.670]  The UFO hysteria just hit all-time highs.
[01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:17.389]  Wait till we hit this.
[01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:19.969]  I gotta budget some time at the end of the hour to hit that.
[01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:20.329]  I will.
[01:07:20.909 --> 01:07:21.070]  All right.
[01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:22.130]  Moving back to this.
[01:07:22.909 --> 01:07:23.309]  So...
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:29.599]  Ukraine strikes Russia again with U.S.-made attack of missiles.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:42.559]  Well, that's an in-force headline, and that's what they're saying, but it's really NATO runs those, the U.S. runs those, so it's NATO attacks Russia with U.S.-made missiles launched from Ukraine.
[01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:43.639]  That's the actual headline.
[01:07:45.249 --> 01:07:48.449]  Netanyahu assails media as he testifies for the first time in his corruption trial.
[01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:49.869]  Why do I put these together?
[01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:56.389]  Well, you got Biden in trouble and the deep state in trouble, trying to use an expanded war as a smokescreen, and you got Netanyahu in all this trouble.
[01:07:57.050 --> 01:08:03.449]  And the standout of October 7th, which they admit the Israeli military did for seven and a half hours, he said, well, when the war is over, we'll investigate.
[01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:04.769]  But it was never going to end.
[01:08:06.369 --> 01:08:08.889]  And then now Israel's going to have to fight the al-Qaeda they put in.
[01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:20.010]  Now, Israel needs to take half of Syria because, you know, Al-Qaeda, they have to blow up all the Navy and the weapons stores, the radar, because Al-Qaeda might get it who they put in.
[01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:28.449]  And then, of course, a lot of the weapons came from the 87 billion in weapons and hardware that Biden left on purpose.
[01:08:28.449 --> 01:08:29.329]  It wasn't an accident.
[01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:34.710]  In Afghanistan, and I said it'll be used mainly in Syria than other areas.
[01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:36.630]  And that's exactly what's going on.
[01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:40.090]  When you look at the Al-Qaeda fighters, you notice they've got AR-15s.
[01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:41.430]  You notice they've got M4s.
[01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:47.489]  You notice they've got U.S. grenade launchers and U.S. heavy machine guns.
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:49.840]  Have you noticed?
[01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:51.260]  Almost all of them.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.680]  Not the old AK-47 anymore.
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.600]  So, that's what's going on here.
[01:08:58.699 --> 01:08:59.720]  It's just a diamond denied.
[01:09:00.119 --> 01:09:00.500]  She's like, yep.
[01:09:01.939 --> 01:09:03.380]  So, very immoral.
[01:09:06.739 --> 01:09:08.380]  U.S. hypocrisy reaches a new level.
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.119]  Israel's occupation of Syria is security.
[01:09:10.239 --> 01:09:11.659]  Russia's moves to Ukraine are aggression.
[01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:16.989]  IDF tanks reach just 25 kilometers from Damascus.
[01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:19.170]  Netanyahu declares Golan is ours forever.
[01:09:24.869 --> 01:09:30.010]  And meanwhile, Turkey's Erdogan is now threatening Israel, saying you better get out, but he's going to take part of the country.
[01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:32.810]  So they're fighting over the spoils.
[01:09:36.670 --> 01:09:37.550]  Pretty wild.
[01:09:38.529 --> 01:09:39.289]  All right.
[01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:42.949]  Moving on now from that.
[01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:49.500]  Let's talk about what I was hitting in the first hour as a prelude that is now happening.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:54.239]  Because just since I talked about what I'm about to hit, this came out.
[01:09:56.079 --> 01:10:04.819]  Democratic governors quietly prep extensive plans to counter Trump, CNN. They're calling it ultra-sanctuary cities.
[01:10:11.659 --> 01:10:17.220]  They call it Super sanctuary cities in some areas like California.
[01:10:19.239 --> 01:10:25.260]  And it says they're going to pay for their dental, health care, insurance, homes, free money, everything with illegal aliens.
[01:10:25.699 --> 01:10:28.439]  Which of course then they'll scrape a big piece off for themselves.
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:39.359]  And they're going to have the governors talking about secession and then you got all these mayors saying we're going to rise up and fight the feds and And it's illegal to come in here and get illegal aliens.
[01:10:39.479 --> 01:10:41.279]  Even the Ninth Circuit said, no, that's in the Constitution.
[01:10:41.899 --> 01:10:44.359]  That's one of the few federal functions they're supposed to be.
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:46.659]  Completely constitutional, completely illegal.
[01:10:46.779 --> 01:10:48.420]  In fact, it's illegal for the feds not to do it.
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:55.760]  That's what the Democrats have done the last four years, is accelerate and accentuate and catapult the illegals in.
[01:10:55.859 --> 01:10:56.579]  Pay them to come.
[01:10:56.699 --> 01:10:57.340]  Tell them to come.
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:00.380]  Soon as I win the election, immediately surge the border, said Biden.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:05.180]  And the NGOs with your tax money from the feds and the State Department, right into those.
[01:11:05.909 --> 01:11:06.529]  Bringing them here.
[01:11:07.109 --> 01:11:11.250]  And the human trafficking and the disappearing of the kids and stopping the DNA testing.
[01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:17.210]  And so that's the enemy within.
[01:11:17.210 --> 01:11:19.770]  The one starting World War III. The one dissolving the border.
[01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:24.630]  The one censoring and surveilling and demonizing the American people.
[01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:30.909]  And you read this article, it's basically a rehash of the New York Times four years ago.
[01:11:31.210 --> 01:11:47.010]  If Trump would have won, they said, well, we're just going to hype up unrest and anger, and we're going to start having states say they're not going to follow orders, and then we're going to, I'm sure Trump's going to attack the migrants, it's going to happen magically, and then we're going to just declare secession, and then we're going to have the military,
[01:11:47.029 --> 01:11:51.569]  and they're already saying this, having meetings about not following his illegal orders to round up the illegals.
[01:11:52.289 --> 01:11:54.890]  Which the court already said is not unconstitutional.
[01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:57.930]  So none of that's going to work.
[01:11:58.069 --> 01:11:58.970]  None of that's going to hunt.
[01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:08.210]  That dog won't hunt unless there's, again, a bunch of the migrants, illegal aliens getting killed or Democrats protesting the deportations getting killed.
[01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:13.350]  And the Democrats are saying Trump supporters are going to come kill Democrats while they protest and migrants.
[01:12:13.819 --> 01:12:14.760]  Now, do you really believe that?
[01:12:14.899 --> 01:12:18.020]  Or are they telling you the last move to legitimize all this?
[01:12:18.119 --> 01:12:24.939]  Because it'll end up putting these governors and mayors in prison if they say, rise up and attack the feds doing constitutional duty.
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:28.340]  So how do you launch an insurrection that is an insurrection?
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:32.539]  Will you do it by waving a bloody shirt with Asian provocateurs?
[01:12:33.579 --> 01:12:40.520]  And you look at what they tried to do with January 6th or what they tried to do with Charlottesville.
[01:12:41.530 --> 01:12:43.470]  Calling it worse than Pearl Harbor and all this.
[01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:46.189]  Imagine somebody mows down 100 illegal aliens or something.
[01:12:47.210 --> 01:12:48.710]  That's the obvious next move.
[01:12:48.869 --> 01:12:51.810]  I've been telling you this for months and months and months and months and now they're prepping it all.
[01:12:51.869 --> 01:12:52.470]  It's just right there.
[01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:56.189]  So what is the answer to that?
[01:12:57.789 --> 01:12:59.250]  Well, you've got to go on the offense.
[01:12:59.550 --> 01:13:00.710]  You've got to find the missing kids.
[01:13:00.869 --> 01:13:01.729]  You've got to go after the NGOs.
[01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:04.289]  You've got to go after the non-profits, the four-profits, right up to the feds.
[01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:09.289]  You've got to prosecute them because it's the right thing to do and find the children and it gets them off balance.
[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:15.239]  Before they launch all of their race war narratives that they're already rolling out.
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.479]  But they haven't gone into full launch mode.
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:21.000]  It's like when a rocket starts taking off, it's going slow, you know, big heavy.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:23.800]  It goes faster and faster and faster.
[01:13:24.039 --> 01:13:26.119]  It's still leaving the gantry right now.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  And so we have to non-violently, politically, it's an analogy, blow it up on the launch pad.
[01:13:33.619 --> 01:13:35.600]  Target, maximum firepower.
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:40.060]  And how do you blow it up on the launch pad?
[01:13:42.930 --> 01:13:46.229]  You immediately launch investigations, subpoenas.
[01:13:46.409 --> 01:13:48.829]  You drag them in at the lowest level.
[01:13:48.949 --> 01:13:50.470]  They immediately flip on the level above.
[01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:54.390]  There's only a few levels up, and then you're already at Mayorkas.
[01:13:54.569 --> 01:13:57.729]  You're already at that idiot criminal investigation.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:01.180]  Kamala Harris, and you're just, you're in there.
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:07.020]  You're in the Soros Foundation, you're in the State Department, and they're all a bunch of cowards, and they are going to turn and run.
[01:14:07.119 --> 01:14:08.279]  No one's ever pushed back.
[01:14:08.579 --> 01:14:10.840]  No one's ever, they thought they were going to steal the election again.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.319]  They thought they were going to be able to traffic the kids.
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:16.060]  They thought they were just, that is their weakness has been their arrogance.
[01:14:16.399 --> 01:14:24.039]  And so, And I told everybody, I've told Trump, I've said it on air a thousand times, you must tell them you're coming.
[01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:26.000]  And people are like, don't tell them we're coming.
[01:14:26.399 --> 01:14:30.640]  They already know that's the smart move, the right move that'll bring them down.
[01:14:30.859 --> 01:14:37.100]  Whatever they tell you not to do, oh God, don't cover us politically, that's mean, that's evil, that's aggressive, that's tyrannical.
[01:14:37.579 --> 01:14:40.159]  No, you're the tyrants and you've got to be dealt with.
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.460]  We can't let Frankenstein keep roaming around in the countryside.
[01:14:43.859 --> 01:14:46.319]  Or it's our responsibility when he breaks somebody's neck.
[01:14:47.689 --> 01:14:51.590]  So, do what must be done, Lord Vader.
[01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:57.069]  Show no mercy, or there will be endless civil war.
[01:14:58.069 --> 01:15:11.489]  So, Trump's National Security Advisor, Michael Waltz, officially classifies Adam Schiff as the enemy within, while simultaneously obliterates legacy media.
[01:15:11.710 --> 01:15:14.250]  And let's play the clip now.
[01:15:15.289 --> 01:15:32.770]  What's clear about why Kelly has said this now, or really reiterated it, confirmed it, is that he has a lot of concerns about Trump talking about this enemy within, this idea of using the American military to target his own political opponents,
[01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:36.510]  which is a very un-American idea, and that that is something.
[01:15:36.829 --> 01:15:37.970]  That's the timing.
[01:15:38.109 --> 01:15:40.189]  To your timing question, that's the answer there.
[01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:41.229]  Well, perhaps.
[01:15:42.119 --> 01:15:43.239]  I don't know John Kelly.
[01:15:43.399 --> 01:15:44.640]  I don't think I've ever even met him.
[01:15:45.079 --> 01:15:50.300]  He clearly has a deep disdain for Donald Trump and was fired by him.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:16:15.529]  You also have the owner of the Atlantic magazine is a huge donor for Kamala Harris and a close We're good to go.
[01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:18.510]  Congressman, he's talked about.
[01:16:19.050 --> 01:16:21.630]  He has named the Pelosi's congressman.
[01:16:21.829 --> 01:16:24.149]  He has named your colleague Adam Schiff.
[01:16:24.170 --> 01:16:32.750]  You have Adam Schiff on this network and many others lying to the American people, opening a hearing, lying to the American people, saying that he had seen...
[01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:33.569]  But you raised him.
[01:16:33.609 --> 01:16:35.470]  No, but whatever you think of him.
[01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:37.729]  And saying he had seen...
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:56.899]  We're good to go.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:04.699]  We have to quell riots and keep law and order, and if the military needs to support law enforcement, fine.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:10.640]  And on the other hand, he said we have people that are misleading the American public, that's causing chaos.
[01:17:10.819 --> 01:17:11.640]  I just want to be clear.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:12.479]  I hope you can roll the tape.
[01:17:12.479 --> 01:17:17.640]  He's talked about the National Guard, and then he talked about the military.
[01:17:17.779 --> 01:17:18.960]  But let's go back to this.
[01:17:19.739 --> 01:17:25.079]  This notion of fascism and centralized control because we have an allegation of rhetoric.
[01:17:25.079 --> 01:17:27.699]  We have, you know, he said versus he said.
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:32.619]  And then what I'm seeing are actual actions by the progressive left.
[01:17:32.939 --> 01:17:38.920]  I mean, fascism really is about no checks and balances, no controls.
[01:17:39.569 --> 01:17:41.289]  They want to stack the Supreme Court.
[01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:42.489]  I've seen that legislation.
[01:17:42.850 --> 01:17:49.550]  They want to eliminate the filibuster, our last kind of harbinger of bipartisanship.
[01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:55.829]  They want to eliminate the electoral college, which would have just a couple of cities determining our next president.
[01:17:56.050 --> 01:17:58.090]  Those are critical checks and balances.
[01:17:58.710 --> 01:18:00.689]  That will check power for anyone.
[01:18:00.909 --> 01:18:04.729]  And the left is actually moving to eliminate them because they don't like them.
[01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:20.510]  So what I think voters are going to have to decide in these next couple of weeks is we have allegations of rhetoric from a conversation four years ago or actions that they are seeing right now from the left or the lack of action in terms of making their lives better in the economy,
[01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:23.510]  in crime, in the border and in global chaos.
[01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:25.229]  And I think it's those actions that...
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:28.720]  So that's from during the election, but he's made similar statements yesterday.
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:36.779]  The point is they are the enemy within, and now they're officially trying to get a race war going, as we told you they would, and they've got plans for secession.
[01:18:36.779 --> 01:18:37.760]  That's mainstream news.
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:43.859]  That is what Hollywood's promoting with these films like Civil War, and it's here.
[01:18:43.979 --> 01:18:44.439]  They're doing it.
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:53.739]  It wasn't hard to predict that the U.S. would start bombing Russia as soon as Trump was president-elect to destabilize things and hand him an escalated fiasco.
[01:18:54.890 --> 01:19:08.329]  Now here's Adam Schiff saying, you absolutely must not be political and go after people criminally, talking about Trump, but then that's all he ever did.
[01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:09.510]  Here it is.
[01:19:10.289 --> 01:19:14.949]  I don't think the incoming president should be threatening his political opponents with jail time.
[01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:19.590]  That's not the kind of talk we should hear from a president in a democracy.
[01:19:19.949 --> 01:19:21.930]  So I know this sounds bizarre.
[01:19:22.409 --> 01:19:25.710]  It sounds like if I said this five years ago, you'd lock me up.
[01:19:30.239 --> 01:19:34.500]  On the day Donald Trump leaves office, the Justice Department may indict him.
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:38.640]  Very strongly in favor of indicting the president when he is out of office.
[01:19:38.859 --> 01:19:43.439]  I don't think the incoming president should be threatening his political opponents with jail time.
[01:19:43.859 --> 01:19:48.100]  That's not the kind of talk we should hear from a president in a democracy.
[01:19:50.319 --> 01:19:52.539]  And Schiff committed a lot of crimes, as you know.
[01:19:52.739 --> 01:19:55.760]  Fake January 6th committee, fake documents, destroying the evidence.
[01:19:56.819 --> 01:19:59.899]  Helping create this dossier of crossfire hurricane.
[01:19:59.899 --> 01:20:02.520]  He is an enemy of this country.
[01:20:03.619 --> 01:20:13.960]  And he supports all of the attempts to suppress Americans, censor Americans, surveil Americans.
[01:20:14.659 --> 01:20:21.979]  And that's why he's one of the main targets of the incoming Trump administration's Justice Department.
[01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:29.859]  And, you know, FBI Director Wray is now, they announced, is going to resign so that Trump doesn't have to fire him.
[01:20:31.279 --> 01:20:33.680]  And you're going to get Cash Mattel and he's going to get approved.
[01:20:34.319 --> 01:20:40.159]  And I've got some clips on that with Senator Thune talking about, no, they're getting behind the Trump agenda.
[01:20:40.159 --> 01:20:41.039]  They're going to do it all.
[01:20:43.239 --> 01:20:46.960]  And so Trump is delivering on everything he said he would do.
[01:20:47.079 --> 01:20:52.460]  He's lining it all up to do it, to stop the war, secure the border, stabilize the dollar, get energy prices cut.
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:55.000]  That's the foundation of getting inflation down.
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.319]  He's getting ready to pull out of the Paris Accords.
[01:20:58.439 --> 01:21:00.060]  We got John Kerry flipping out about that.
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:01.779]  That would totally destroy our country forever.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:09.180]  And the outgoing Biden administration is now charging people for environmental crimes of carbon.
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:12.500]  And you're like, oh, well, good.
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:14.840]  Somebody brought Freon into the U.S., put them in jail for 10 years.
[01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:18.960]  They also list carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas and evil.
[01:21:19.279 --> 01:21:20.640]  To what plants breathe, folks.
[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:22.659]  You want to go to jail for that?
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.079]  That's what they're already doing in Europe.
[01:21:25.239 --> 01:21:27.579]  So you want to be a slave.
[01:21:27.579 --> 01:21:28.920]  You want to live under feudalism.
[01:21:29.159 --> 01:21:32.819]  You want to have your energy rations, your carbon credit.
[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:34.199]  This is here.
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:37.640]  And I've got articles today where they're rolling out all of this all over the world right now.
[01:21:38.710 --> 01:21:48.090]  So we need to get Trump in and have him kill the ESGs, kill the central bank digital currencies, kill the global carbon program, which is already happening.
[01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:49.350]  It's falling apart.
[01:21:49.710 --> 01:22:00.689]  So praise Jesus, praise the Lord, and pass the ammunition, the peaceful, nonviolent ammunition of the Infowar.
[01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:03.890]  And this broadcast is a giant munitions dump.
[01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:17.989]  Of weapons of truth, flaming arrows and daggers and swords, catapulting the truth directly at the enemies of humanity.
[01:22:18.329 --> 01:22:19.829]  It's an epic time to be alive.
[01:22:19.829 --> 01:22:21.109]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:42.600]  Thank you, sir.
[01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:46.770]  They basically almost destroyed my parents.
[01:22:46.869 --> 01:22:53.310]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family that my dad was at the edge of bankruptcy himself with all the lawsuits the Democrats filed.
[01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:57.329]  By the way, they said in court that their attorney's fees are $316 million yesterday.
[01:22:57.729 --> 01:23:00.270]  They filed before they spent $80 million suing me.
[01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:02.090]  We spent $16 million fighting them.
[01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:03.970]  My dad spent $2 million fighting them.
[01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:05.130]  And we're finally winning.
[01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:16.659]  Not only does my dad's supplement company, drjonesnaturals.com, have some of the best supplements, it is a personal request, I ask you, To support him because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[01:23:16.819 --> 01:23:26.840]  He was giving everything to InfoWars and then personally going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me because that's how dads are.
[01:23:27.279 --> 01:23:28.340]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:34.619]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office and I got pissed.
[01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:42.350]  So, it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day, and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[01:23:42.789 --> 01:23:44.050]  The supplements are there.
[01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:44.850]  They're great.
[01:23:45.029 --> 01:23:46.189]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[01:23:46.210 --> 01:23:47.550]  He's put everything into it he has.
[01:23:47.649 --> 01:23:48.210]  They're incredible.
[01:23:48.489 --> 01:23:58.170]  I've given so much to this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything, that I don't want to belabor this.
[01:23:58.210 --> 01:23:59.470]  We have important topics to cover.
[01:24:00.319 --> 01:24:01.539]  Please support us.

[01:24:22.579 --> 01:24:23.699]  And my dad...
[01:24:23.729 --> 01:24:30.289]  Literally took a loan last week to be able to buy the product that's coming in finally next week.
[01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:32.590]  Turbo Force, things like that that are popular.
[01:24:32.789 --> 01:24:35.289]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[01:24:35.850 --> 01:24:39.789]  And the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down.
[01:24:40.130 --> 01:24:41.449]  My dad won't stop fighting.
[01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:42.210]  He's a fighter.
[01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:43.170]  Hell, he's my dad.
[01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:44.310]  I think I'm a fighter.
[01:24:44.529 --> 01:24:45.930]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:54.130]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:56.989]  But this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:57.109 --> 01:24:58.069]  It's about my parents.
[01:24:58.649 --> 01:25:04.170]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's what the enemy targeted them.
[01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:07.649]  Please, support the Infowar today.
[01:25:07.869 --> 01:25:09.789]  Support my mother and my father.
[01:25:09.869 --> 01:25:12.770]  I'm asking you personally for you to do it now.
[01:25:12.989 --> 01:25:15.649]  And at 5% of the millions watching, we go do it.
[01:25:15.789 --> 01:25:17.510]  All our problems will be over in one minute.
[01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:23.149]  But it's less than one half, one percent to ever buy anything from drjonesnacros.com or thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:25.970]  And for those that do support, thank you for keeping us in the fight.
[01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:26.800]  For our futures.
[01:25:27.479 --> 01:25:30.439]  So, the AlexJonesStore.com, DRJonesStore.com.
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.039]  I'm going to shut up at the balance of this hour.
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:39.279]  Here's what I'm going to do before Mike Adams comes on with a deep dive on the attempt to roll out a new pandemic, lockdowns, all of it.
[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:39.699]  They've said it.
[01:25:39.779 --> 01:25:40.220]  They're doing it.
[01:25:40.859 --> 01:25:41.479]  Big deal.
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:42.420]  Got to get ahead of it.
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:46.699]  World War III, track to take control of society.
[01:25:46.939 --> 01:25:52.000]  They're rolling out the Blue Beam operation, the fake alien invasion, race war, all of it.
[01:25:53.569 --> 01:25:54.869]  And we're here exposing it.
[01:25:54.909 --> 01:25:55.829]  That's why they don't like us on here.
[01:25:56.810 --> 01:25:58.350]  Remember, we were supposed to be gone.
[01:25:58.449 --> 01:25:59.289]  The Onion bought us.
[01:25:59.409 --> 01:25:59.970]  They said so.
[01:26:00.090 --> 01:26:01.229]  New York Times said so.
[01:26:02.069 --> 01:26:06.529]  I told you on November 14th that wasn't the case.
[01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:11.369]  Did I tell you the truth or did they tell you the truth?
[01:26:12.989 --> 01:26:14.390]  Big surprise, they lie.
[01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:16.409]  All right.
[01:26:20.439 --> 01:26:25.359]  I got a couple of days of stacks here that I didn't get to in the last few days, and then new stuff that broke today.
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:34.220]  So I want to spend some time here on the main initiative of the destruction of the family programs.
[01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:37.560]  We've got a lot of them, and that's the whole transgender movement.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:41.340]  And most of the transgender people are just brainwashed victims or autistic people.
[01:26:42.710 --> 01:26:43.869]  From the chemicals and all the rest of it.
[01:26:43.949 --> 01:26:44.569]  They're victims.
[01:26:44.689 --> 01:26:45.329]  I don't hate them.
[01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:46.550]  Most of them are not bad people.
[01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:52.850]  People say, well, you've been on the air for 30 years exposing the transgender movement before anybody else was, but then you're nice to the transgender people.
[01:26:53.029 --> 01:26:54.770]  I don't hate them as individual people.
[01:26:56.010 --> 01:26:57.649]  And people say they're born that way.
[01:26:59.229 --> 01:27:11.329]  In utero, just atrazine, the allowable levels in the water, doesn't create a male to female, but it creates hermaphroditic effects in brain structure.
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:18.560]  So they're not men that are really women, or they're not women that are really men, a lot of them.
[01:27:18.779 --> 01:27:20.279]  I mean, they look different, too.
[01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:37.020]  The ones that are truly, you know, genetic, a mutation, embryonic development in the zygote in the first few weeks of cell replication, you know, after the egg meets the sperm, and you have an insemination,
[01:27:37.159 --> 01:27:39.520]  and then the fertilization.
[01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:45.329]  They are mutants.
[01:27:47.529 --> 01:27:49.670]  And this is being done artificially.
[01:27:50.170 --> 01:27:52.569]  So I don't hate mutants.
[01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:53.670]  I feel sorry for them.
[01:27:54.689 --> 01:27:57.710]  And they've tried, as humans do, to adapt to what they are.
[01:27:58.189 --> 01:28:03.250]  And the globalists, this is a long-term strategic plan that I told you about decades ago that's now admitted.
[01:28:04.729 --> 01:28:06.250]  So this has been done by design.
[01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:13.029]  Now, a lot of them are just pedophiles and criminals and, you know, sickos.
[01:28:15.010 --> 01:28:16.770]  But, you know, Tim Walz types.
[01:28:17.689 --> 01:28:29.189]  But the point is, is that we have to get the chemicals out of the water and the food.
[01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:31.590]  And that's what Make America Healthy Again is about.
[01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:33.189]  We are the most unhealthy country in the world.
[01:28:33.310 --> 01:28:34.010]  We're the main target.
[01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:35.829]  Trump's like, we're gonna get the fluoride out.
[01:28:36.029 --> 01:28:36.789]  It's happening.
[01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:39.409]  And the system's scared.
[01:28:41.409 --> 01:28:43.529]  But I got a big stack of news on this today.
[01:28:45.010 --> 01:29:04.210]  And as they blur the sexes and do all of this, and when a boy has lower bone mass than his ancestors, and what his genetic complement should manifest and express, and when a girl has these male attributes,
[01:29:04.210 --> 01:29:10.170]  she's not really a male, but she's been bent that direction, because all embryos at the first stage of development are female.
[01:29:10.369 --> 01:29:10.770]  Look it up.
[01:29:12.010 --> 01:29:13.890]  That's why men have nipples.
[01:29:18.090 --> 01:29:20.390]  And then they start saying, well, there is no male or female.
[01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:32.350]  Because it's in Brave New World, written in 1931, published in 1932. Brave New World Revisited, published in 1961. Aldous Huxley, brother transhumanist head, head of the UN UNESCO program.
[01:29:32.489 --> 01:29:36.949]  And he said in the nonfiction, 1961, Brave New World Revisited, that I tell you about all the time.
[01:29:37.050 --> 01:29:39.630]  You can go listen to his speech at Berkeley on.
[01:29:39.689 --> 01:29:40.949]  It's only an hour and two minutes long.
[01:29:41.670 --> 01:29:43.229]  He says, no, this is really our plan.
[01:29:43.369 --> 01:29:46.430]  Chemicals in the water to bend the genders and finally get rid of them.
[01:29:46.890 --> 01:29:49.670]  So, I mean, they've been doing this a while, folks.
[01:29:50.489 --> 01:29:52.250]  And what I'm telling you isn't my opinion.
[01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:53.229]  It's a fact.
[01:29:53.529 --> 01:30:11.079]  So instead of us all fighting each other and just hating these people who are brainwashed and who the globalists are pushing as a cult that wants in our bathrooms and women's sports, You've got to cut the head off the snake and understand it's a project.
[01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:13.060]  It's an operation.
[01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:18.579]  I mean, if you're into animal husbandry or studied it or worked around it like I have or you're into...
[01:30:19.930 --> 01:30:21.609]  Farming and agriculture and all of that.
[01:30:22.109 --> 01:30:30.090]  Since the 50s, US scientists and others came up with systems to mitigate this fly or this ant or this moth.
[01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:35.050]  And they learned really quick, pesticides don't get them all and are expensive and hurt other life.
[01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:46.310]  Well, so they come up with systems that biologically, chemicals and other things, now they've got mutinogens and things and basically mRNA and things that go in, they spray, and it just sterilizes the animals.
[01:30:48.590 --> 01:31:00.689]  Or makes them not attracted to the opposite sex, or in the case of atrazine and frogs and anybody else that comes in contact, any other species, whether it's mammalian or amphibian or...
[01:31:00.689 --> 01:31:04.090]  Ornithologists will tell you it does anything to birds.
[01:31:06.329 --> 01:31:15.310]  You hit the eggs, you hit the embryos, that's what a frog egg is, an embryo, developing frog into a tadpole and then into a frog.
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:22.380]  You just hit it with allowable levels of atrazine, and most of the frogs never have sex, and the ones they are attracted to are other males.
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:28.939]  So, this is being done by design.
[01:31:29.359 --> 01:31:38.340]  So, they want you just to get angry and fight with the mutants instead of going and explaining it to them, you know, what's happened to them.
[01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:43.039]  Because I always use the analogy of the last man on Earth that got made into...
[01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:48.460]  Omega Man with Charlton Heston and then Will Smith with I Am Legend.
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.300]  I need to do a review of this sometime.
[01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:52.859]  I've talked about it a lot but I've never actually shown it.
[01:31:53.359 --> 01:31:58.319]  But the first one came out in the early 60s and it was a great big movie.
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:04.039]  It's with Vincent Price.
[01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:10.779]  And so he's a scientist and this virus gets released and it's pretty clear the military leaked it.
[01:32:11.470 --> 01:32:12.369]  And everybody's dying.
[01:32:12.829 --> 01:32:16.170]  But some of them get back up after they're dead.
[01:32:16.170 --> 01:32:17.689]  It's one of the first zombie movies.
[01:32:18.369 --> 01:32:20.350]  And kind of start the zombie genre.
[01:32:20.909 --> 01:32:23.829]  And then they go around killing people.
[01:32:24.149 --> 01:32:30.029]  But a small percentage of those that survive but become zombies still have their intelligence.
[01:32:31.670 --> 01:32:34.109]  And they don't want to stop being zombies.
[01:32:34.130 --> 01:32:35.229]  And they don't want the cure.
[01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:37.430]  To stop being undead.
[01:32:37.649 --> 01:32:48.050]  In fact, they want the last man left in the city, Los Angeles, Vincent Price, and then Charlton Heston, and then in the New York-style remake, Will Smith, dead.
[01:32:51.609 --> 01:32:59.430]  And, you know, it's cheesy as hell, but it's probably the best version of all three for making it so clear with the Christlike figure of Charlton Heston.
[01:33:00.810 --> 01:33:03.770]  He goes to him and he says, look, I'm a scientist.
[01:33:03.949 --> 01:33:04.810]  I survived.
[01:33:05.109 --> 01:33:07.149]  Obviously, it's because my blood has the antibody.
[01:33:08.909 --> 01:33:10.510]  You can be fixed.
[01:33:10.710 --> 01:33:12.770]  And they said, no, we're going to kill you.
[01:33:12.770 --> 01:33:13.449]  And they do.
[01:33:18.170 --> 01:33:19.569]  And then they crucify him.
[01:33:20.850 --> 01:33:27.050]  But then he's already gotten into a group of scientists outside the city that's surviving, and now they have the cure.
[01:33:28.130 --> 01:33:32.489]  But the point is, Vincent Price is like, you know, sitting there and he's like, look, I got the cure.
[01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:33.789]  And they go, we don't want the cure.
[01:33:33.869 --> 01:33:36.590]  And they throw, you know, a spear right into his chest.
[01:33:36.689 --> 01:33:37.289]  Same thing with Heston.
[01:33:38.350 --> 01:33:41.369]  And that's the issue with the left and the mutants.
[01:33:42.069 --> 01:33:43.930]  Because we're all been mutated to a certain extent.
[01:33:44.050 --> 01:33:46.409]  I mean, penis sizes generation for generation are going down.
[01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:48.010]  Testosterone's down.
[01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:50.970]  Bone density in men is down.
[01:33:53.989 --> 01:33:55.409]  I mean, we're...
[01:33:55.409 --> 01:33:56.750]  I mean, I'm masculine.
[01:33:58.310 --> 01:34:02.229]  But I'm not as masculine as my grandfathers.
[01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:09.289]  I mean, my dad's dad looked like what John Wayne wished he looked like.
[01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:13.029]  I mean, he'd come in the room and I was like, whoa, that's the alpha right there.
[01:34:14.850 --> 01:34:17.229]  I mean, you look at it, men aren't like we used to be.
[01:34:17.609 --> 01:34:29.090]  And when these children have already been given this bent, depending on how it manipulated them in development, There's a lot of different spectrums, different chemicals mixed together to different things.
[01:34:29.250 --> 01:34:30.369]  It's a giant experiment.
[01:34:32.649 --> 01:34:37.430]  The children then go, oh, you're not really feeling really masculine or whatever.
[01:34:37.529 --> 01:34:39.130]  Well, that's because we want to bend it more.
[01:34:39.329 --> 01:34:40.789]  Let's give you female hormones.
[01:34:40.890 --> 01:34:41.810]  Let's give you puberty blockers.
[01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:43.949]  Let's make you express that more.
[01:34:44.109 --> 01:34:45.949]  Instead, a lot of studies are coming out.
[01:34:46.010 --> 01:34:46.729]  Of course, it's common sense.
[01:34:47.970 --> 01:34:49.010]  People should be...
[01:34:49.010 --> 01:34:50.310]  We should admit this is going on.
[01:34:50.369 --> 01:34:51.350]  Look at the different syndromes.
[01:34:51.409 --> 01:34:52.109]  Look at the different problems.
[01:34:52.329 --> 01:34:53.050]  And then say...
[01:34:54.159 --> 01:34:59.699]  And then the medical system can actually make money, but helping people and reversing this, but you always got to make them money or they won't do it.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.140]  You got to create a market that can get rid of a bad market.
[01:35:02.279 --> 01:35:02.579]  It's a good market.
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:05.479]  And then you go in and get assessed and genetically looked at.
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:08.579]  And then your kids, if you think they're bent that way, you start watching it.
[01:35:08.659 --> 01:35:20.869]  And then like when kids used to not have a pituitary gland to produce enough growth hormone, And they still do it, and you notice, you know, dad's 6'4", and mom's, you know, 5'10", but your three-year-old's not growing.
[01:35:21.090 --> 01:35:24.170]  Well, by age five, they go, oh, we've tested your child's blood.
[01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:25.050]  There's no growth hormone.
[01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:27.149]  We're going to give your child growth hormone.
[01:35:27.289 --> 01:35:33.270]  And then your child's healthier, lives longer, and grows up to a normal size instead of being three feet tall.
[01:35:34.289 --> 01:35:35.029]  A midget.
[01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:36.989]  See, dwarfs its genetics.
[01:35:38.899 --> 01:35:41.460]  Midgets are a lot more rare, but people call dwarfs midgets.
[01:35:41.619 --> 01:35:44.060]  A midget is anatomically correct.
[01:35:44.319 --> 01:35:49.520]  The hands are the right size, the head's all proportionate, but they're just little.
[01:35:50.979 --> 01:36:01.880]  So when people are about to be a midget, because there's no pituitary growth hormone, you give them human growth hormone, and then they are healthier and live longer and are able to have a good life.
[01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:04.600]  So we should be going, oh...
[01:36:06.199 --> 01:36:06.960]  All over the world.
[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:09.699]  Oh, your kid's going to commit suicide if you don't let us take control.
[01:36:09.779 --> 01:36:10.979]  When they tell the kid, you're going to commit suicide.
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:11.640]  We're going to save you.
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:12.100]  You're going to commit suicide.
[01:36:12.239 --> 01:36:13.079]  He's like, I'm going to commit suicide.
[01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:14.260]  Yeah, do what we say.
[01:36:14.399 --> 01:36:15.000]  Take these chemicals.
[01:36:15.159 --> 01:36:16.920]  They see the kid's already bent.
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:17.939]  They go and they target them.
[01:36:17.979 --> 01:36:18.640]  They put them in a cult.
[01:36:18.859 --> 01:36:19.899]  Don't tell the parents what's going on.
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:23.140]  Take them away politically or physically if they need to.
[01:36:24.779 --> 01:36:27.000]  And then continue them down, the bending them.
[01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:28.800]  Oh, we bent your kid this way with chemicals.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:30.420]  Now we're going to bend them all the way.
[01:36:30.619 --> 01:36:32.220]  But you won't really be a woman.
[01:36:33.319 --> 01:36:37.380]  We'll just cut your penis off and your testicles, that way you never have any children.
[01:36:43.119 --> 01:36:50.460]  And then the estrogen members in the food and everything further accentuate that, but then what's it do to a woman?
[01:36:51.409 --> 01:36:53.010]  What do these chemicals do to a woman?
[01:36:53.489 --> 01:36:59.029]  And there's a whole bunch of different classes of them, but in general, they make them bulkier, stockier, more masculine.
[01:36:59.029 --> 01:37:00.369]  They go into puberty earlier.
[01:37:00.930 --> 01:37:02.329]  They don't live as long.
[01:37:02.529 --> 01:37:03.810]  They have higher cancer rates.
[01:37:04.689 --> 01:37:19.670]  And they tell those women, whether it's been done by the chemicals or whether it's a tomboy, Oh, you're really a man, so now we're going to give you this chemical.
[01:37:20.130 --> 01:37:31.630]  So they bend you away you're not supposed to be, and then instead of saying we're going to bend you back, and that's the parents' decision, oh no, don't ever bend them back to what they're supposed to be.
[01:37:31.770 --> 01:37:33.170]  No, we're going to bend you the other way.
[01:37:33.649 --> 01:37:35.609]  They have no moral argument in that.
[01:37:37.449 --> 01:37:39.250]  So, I'm saying it.
[01:37:39.369 --> 01:37:45.449]  There needs to be systems launched, programs, studies, and kids can do that, and then bend the kids back.
[01:37:47.010 --> 01:37:48.670]  As close to where they're supposed to be.
[01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:57.569]  The average male in America, depending on the age, it varies, but it's got about a third of the testosterone we had in 1960. Look it up.
[01:37:59.590 --> 01:38:02.970]  So, this is a program.
[01:38:03.729 --> 01:38:05.729]  It didn't just magically fall out of the sky.
[01:38:05.729 --> 01:38:07.369]  We're not just not living as long.
[01:38:07.529 --> 01:38:09.130]  We're not just having all these new diseases.
[01:38:09.289 --> 01:38:10.850]  We're not just having lowered IQs for no reason.
[01:38:11.069 --> 01:38:12.810]  The fluoride, all of that did it.
[01:38:14.439 --> 01:38:25.960]  And just like they mitigate fire ants or other species by putting chemicals on them or biologically manipulating them or spraying chemicals on different things that you want to affect their development and mitigate them.
[01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:31.140]  It's the same thing with us and that's what the vaccines and all of this is.
[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:33.119]  It's none of it's for what they say it's for.
[01:38:33.439 --> 01:38:35.760]  And you see the effects of the projects.
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:38.119]  So...
[01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:42.590]  Mel Gibson nailed it when super viral yesterday.
[01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:51.329]  Hundreds of millions of views on X. Mel Gibson praises those exposing all those wolves in sheep's clothing that prey upon our young and powerful Mar-a-Lago speech.
[01:38:52.590 --> 01:38:53.109]  That's right.
[01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:54.270]  Go after the pedophiles.
[01:38:54.329 --> 01:38:55.210]  That brings them all down.
[01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:56.050]  It's the right thing to do.
[01:38:56.770 --> 01:39:01.369]  Then Bill Maher slams Neal Zagrass Tyson for refusing to say men have advantage over women in sports.
[01:39:01.489 --> 01:39:02.850]  And we've got all the science here.
[01:39:02.949 --> 01:39:06.229]  But it's like saying, do you need a science class to tell you the sun's hot?
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:09.300]  Or to say that women have a uterus and men don't?
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:12.699]  Or that women have, on average, half the muscle strength and half the bone density?
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:14.659]  I mean, we already know all this.
[01:39:14.779 --> 01:39:17.159]  But Neal Zagrass Tyson goes, science, science, science.
[01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:18.000]  The shots work.
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:19.000]  Totally protect you.
[01:39:19.159 --> 01:39:19.640]  All a lie.
[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:21.479]  There are no X and Y chromosomes.
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:23.319]  Women are just as strong as men.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:24.439]  Not true.
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:25.439]  Not true.
[01:39:25.859 --> 01:39:26.140]  Not...
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:29.159]  They need to prop all this up while they blur the sexes.
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:32.399]  And tell us the problem is you're not bent enough.
[01:39:35.399 --> 01:39:37.439]  So I'm like Omega Man and so are you.
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:41.220]  I'm like Charlton Heston in that great 1960s movie.
[01:39:41.859 --> 01:39:43.619]  Or Vincent Price, Last Man on Earth.
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:47.720]  And I'm coming to the mutants.
[01:39:48.199 --> 01:39:50.960]  And I'm saying, listen, this was done to you.
[01:39:51.039 --> 01:39:51.699]  This is not good.
[01:39:51.819 --> 01:39:52.619]  You're not going to live as long.
[01:39:52.699 --> 01:39:53.220]  It hurts you.
[01:39:53.439 --> 01:39:54.479]  You're in a lot of danger.
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:57.260]  Cancer is way up in groups that have really been hit by this.
[01:39:58.010 --> 01:39:59.550]  We need to study this and work together.
[01:39:59.710 --> 01:40:03.010]  And I'm not mad at you that you feel like you're a woman and that you're attracted to men.
[01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:04.250]  I'm not saying you're a bad person.
[01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:08.489]  What I'm saying is this has been done to you and it's being done to more people and it's more intense.
[01:40:08.670 --> 01:40:09.850]  We need to fix this together.
[01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:11.189]  And listen, I'm a mutant too.
[01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:12.970]  We've all been affected by this.
[01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:15.350]  But I'm a mutant because I'm Caucasian.
[01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:19.590]  And all Caucasians are an extreme mutation.
[01:40:20.890 --> 01:40:23.489]  You only see the black racist groups go, you're a mutant also.
[01:40:23.729 --> 01:40:24.489]  Well, yeah, we are.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:27.699]  But with mutations, some good things happen too.
[01:40:29.710 --> 01:40:34.430]  But the point is, is that that's been a natural process on this planet.
[01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:37.470]  Not one artificially done with directed evolution.
[01:40:37.789 --> 01:40:39.270]  And that's what we're under right now.
[01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:42.970]  Just like with Pfizer creating deadly viruses, that's directed, accelerated evolution.
[01:40:43.470 --> 01:40:55.550]  And I don't want to get in an argument with people that take the interpretation of Christians 200 years ago and having fake scientific discussions, putting their scientific understanding onto the Bible when they can't even read it and understand it.
[01:40:57.699 --> 01:41:01.399]  You got the Nephilim down here genetically manipulating us and God didn't like it and wiped him out.
[01:41:01.479 --> 01:41:02.619]  You guys don't even know how to read the Bible.
[01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:06.319]  Yeah, the evolution, they say that we came from a fish that became a monkey.
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:08.119]  Yeah, that evolution is not real.
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:11.359]  But there's evolution all around you.
[01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:21.710]  You give a woman allowable levels of atrazine And in many cases, the baby comes out with a vagina and a penis.
[01:41:22.430 --> 01:41:23.430]  That's a mutation.
[01:41:23.949 --> 01:41:27.569]  And when they pass that mutation on, that's evolution.
[01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:30.029]  That's science.
[01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:31.029]  That's going on.
[01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:34.970]  And we know in species development that they never...
[01:41:34.970 --> 01:41:36.069]  It doesn't happen over a long period.
[01:41:36.090 --> 01:41:36.829]  It jumps.
[01:41:37.069 --> 01:41:40.909]  There's these huge jumps in the fossil record and all of it.
[01:41:40.989 --> 01:41:44.649]  And now they're digging stuff up that's hundreds of thousands of years old, millions of years old, still intact.
[01:41:44.649 --> 01:41:45.750]  They got the genetics.
[01:41:45.890 --> 01:41:46.229]  They know.
[01:41:48.010 --> 01:41:55.750]  They dig up a mammoth from a thousand years before, and suddenly they dig up one in the same frozen ravine that's a thousand years later, and its genetics are wildly different.
[01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:57.409]  But it's related to that one.
[01:41:57.569 --> 01:41:59.569]  What made it change so quick?
[01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:03.069]  Solar radiation and different deep space radiation.
[01:42:03.069 --> 01:42:05.350]  That goes in and hit your cells constantly.
[01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:10.069]  And it depends on what's hitting the planet at what time.
[01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:11.050]  That's the big driver.
[01:42:16.810 --> 01:42:19.630]  We're electrochemical, transceivers.
[01:42:19.989 --> 01:42:21.050]  We receive and transmit.
[01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:23.250]  The space winds affect us.
[01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:30.470]  Why do you think the moon is a documented scientific effect on people's brains?
[01:42:30.729 --> 01:42:32.149]  Why are we synced to it?
[01:42:32.210 --> 01:42:34.449]  Why are women's menstrual cycles on 28 day cycle?
[01:42:34.729 --> 01:42:37.670]  We are synced to the universe, people.
[01:42:38.569 --> 01:42:43.430]  And they come in and put a bunch of chemicals in the water knowing exactly what they're doing.
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:47.100]  So, I care about all the mutants.
[01:42:48.039 --> 01:42:49.880]  Because we're all mutants at the end of the day.
[01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:52.720]  But did we mutate slowly under God's plan?
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:55.300]  Or was these people playing God doing it?
[01:42:56.130 --> 01:43:00.850]  And then Niels de Grasse Tyson gets up and says, there's no difference between men and women.
[01:43:01.050 --> 01:43:02.670]  That's a cult, people.
[01:43:02.949 --> 01:43:16.670]  When someone tells you something on its face that is preposterously ridiculous, they know it's a lie, and they're there gaslighting you to make sure you never get any basic scientific understanding to understand what is happening to us.
[01:43:17.130 --> 01:43:18.710]  Why is this going on?
[01:43:18.890 --> 01:43:21.229]  And what are we going to do about it?
[01:43:29.090 --> 01:43:34.149]  All right, let's go to Mel Gibson lazing the target.
[01:43:34.289 --> 01:43:34.689]  Here it is.
[01:43:34.970 --> 01:43:37.550]  Four years of thinly veiled Marxism.
[01:43:38.789 --> 01:43:43.590]  And now I think what we have is a four year grace period.
[01:43:44.930 --> 01:43:46.970]  But we have to work hard, all of them.
[01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:53.489]  And I don't know, the president's got a big job on his hands to turn this place around.
[01:43:53.630 --> 01:43:54.890]  A lot of damage is done.
[01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:58.449]  And they continue to start fires, just like around my house.
[01:44:01.149 --> 01:44:05.750]  But I'd like to thank what the general here is doing.
[01:44:06.130 --> 01:44:11.810]  He's no small part of this because the problem here is many, many faceted.
[01:44:12.449 --> 01:44:19.529]  And for he and his sister Mary for exposing all these wolves in sheep's clothing that prey upon our young.
[01:44:22.090 --> 01:44:23.670]  I mean, I got nine kids.
[01:44:24.289 --> 01:44:28.329]  I don't know, if one of them got stolen or trafficked or something, I'd have to kill someone.
[01:44:34.170 --> 01:44:36.529]  So that we tolerate this as we do.
[01:44:36.670 --> 01:44:39.130]  Well, we see people here we won't tolerate.
[01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:41.149]  And that should work.
[01:44:41.289 --> 01:44:45.409]  But look, I'm just happy to be here and accept this, very proud.
[01:44:45.810 --> 01:44:54.609]  And I hope in the next four years we can get back some of that precious commodity that this country has.
[01:44:54.949 --> 01:44:57.350]  That commodity called freedom, alright?
[01:44:57.569 --> 01:45:07.100]  So it's like, we'll see how much This administration can claw back from the Philistines.
[01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:08.359]  Okay, thank you very much.
[01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:28.840]  Okay, I'm gonna bring Kid Rock up here in a second.
[01:45:30.389 --> 01:45:36.710]  One of the things, just because I really do very much appreciate everybody's patience.
[01:45:36.949 --> 01:45:38.949]  I mean, it's a very exciting night.
[01:45:39.149 --> 01:45:40.829]  It's a big group here.
[01:45:40.949 --> 01:45:46.050]  We have over 700, I think 720 people that maxed this room out.
[01:45:46.170 --> 01:45:51.829]  We're so grateful for everybody and everybody's support, everybody's patience.
[01:45:52.949 --> 01:45:54.829]  These nights are fleeting.
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:46:03.619]  One of the things, and I won't talk about it in any sort of detail because I want to get Kid Rock up here, but one of the things that I was...
[01:46:03.619 --> 01:46:13.199]  And Tom Homan said again yesterday, we'll play the clip coming up, they're going criminally after the NGOs, they're going to fine the kids, they're going to go after the administration.
[01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:17.310]  We're going to go to break.
[01:46:17.609 --> 01:46:23.890]  In a few minutes, we're going to come back, and I'm going to get to the Nils de Grice Tyson clips, and then Mike Adams is on with us.
[01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:26.930]  But I want to get this on record about the transgender operation and show you some of the documents.
[01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:29.310]  You don't need me to tell you men and women are different.
[01:46:29.829 --> 01:46:31.449]  It's the same in all the species.
[01:46:31.890 --> 01:46:35.829]  Birds, fish, amphibians, mammals, marsupials.
[01:46:38.869 --> 01:46:44.970]  And, again, think of our fellow humans that have been put in a cult believing there's not a difference.
[01:46:45.699 --> 01:46:46.640]  Between the sexes.
[01:46:46.859 --> 01:46:52.720]  And the blurring of it is a good thing when it's a major project to turn us into factory farm creatures.
[01:46:52.939 --> 01:46:55.100]  That's the New World Order plan for what's left.
[01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:56.779]  A commodity, a replicant.
[01:46:57.420 --> 01:46:59.000]  These people playing God.
[01:46:59.239 --> 01:47:00.399]  They, the Morlocks.
[01:47:01.199 --> 01:47:02.359]  We, the Eloys.
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:08.659]  In H.G. Wells' analogy, which he read in books, non-fiction, saying that's the real plan.
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:09.739]  Alright.
[01:47:10.399 --> 01:47:11.340]  We're going to go to break.
[01:47:11.699 --> 01:47:12.779]  Start the next hour.
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:13.380]  Never forget.

[01:47:29.409 --> 01:47:31.710]  And with Trump coming in, hopefully we shut this down.
[01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:37.670]  And we can use the money you send us to expand and get more reporters 24 hours a day and really do what we're supposed to do.

[01:49:30.289 --> 01:49:36.380]  Unfortunately, This will solve all our problems, but they only made 2,000 in this limited edition.
[01:49:36.859 --> 01:49:42.479]  But it'll go a long way towards our lawsuits and funding our operations and the new network and everything else and keeping InfoWars on it.
[01:49:42.619 --> 01:49:43.319]  That continues.
[01:49:43.479 --> 01:49:44.319]  Look at this bad boy.
[01:49:44.439 --> 01:49:47.180]  The 1984 versus 1776 coin.
[01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:47.979]  I designed it.
[01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:52.899]  There's only 2,000 of these bad boys at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:49:53.039 --> 01:49:54.399]  And they are a fundraiser.
[01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:55.880]  They are a piece of history.
[01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:57.880]  They're pure silver.
[01:49:58.300 --> 01:50:00.819]  They are minted here in America.
[01:50:01.949 --> 01:50:03.149]  2,000 of these.
[01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:05.590]  I predict these sell out in just a couple days.

[01:50:18.109 --> 01:50:32.399]  And it's not, the store's not owned by me, so even if the globalists come after us, So get this amazing coin now.
[01:50:32.579 --> 01:50:46.430]  And if you don't want to, don't have the money to get that, because it's marked up for a fundraiser, a memento, a limited edition, We have challenge coins, a whole bunch of them, between 995 and 1495. When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.
[01:50:46.710 --> 01:50:49.029]  And on the other side, it's got the Gadsden flag, don't tread on me.
[01:50:49.649 --> 01:50:52.130]  1776, another one with Alex Jones, yours truly on it.
[01:50:52.270 --> 01:50:55.170]  The answer to 1904 is 1776 with the Gadsden flag.
[01:50:55.529 --> 01:50:57.729]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God on the other side.
[01:50:57.850 --> 01:50:59.569]  And there's some other great challenge coins as well.
[01:50:59.770 --> 01:51:02.789]  At thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:51:02.970 --> 01:51:05.090]  Now, this is even more exciting.
[01:51:05.289 --> 01:51:06.350]  They surprised me with this.
[01:51:06.430 --> 01:51:07.449]  I just learned this morning.
[01:51:07.470 --> 01:51:11.810]  So it's in the mail from Arkansas where their factory is and their shipping department and all that.
[01:51:12.029 --> 01:51:14.130]  The big lead that owns and runs thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:51:14.329 --> 01:51:19.289]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump on a Stump, 1995. Everybody loves Elf on a Shelf.
[01:51:19.449 --> 01:51:22.369]  This is Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[01:51:22.529 --> 01:51:24.390]  Oh, my daughter loves Elf on a Shelf.
[01:51:24.569 --> 01:51:26.149]  We play with him, do all sorts of stuff.
[01:51:26.890 --> 01:51:29.229]  Catapult around the house, play with the cats, play with them.
[01:51:29.689 --> 01:51:33.010]  We've probably got 15 of those Elf on a Shelf, both little elf village in the backyard.
[01:51:33.250 --> 01:51:33.810]  We have a lot of fun.
[01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:37.770]  She puts Christmas tree lights on these little trees we got in the backyard.
[01:51:38.109 --> 01:51:39.829]  Oh my gosh, I've got to have this.
[01:51:39.970 --> 01:51:40.670]  And I already called them.
[01:51:40.789 --> 01:51:42.789]  I said, I want 10 set aside for me.
[01:51:42.869 --> 01:51:43.710]  So that means there's...
[01:51:45.319 --> 01:51:47.199]  1,900 and something of these.
[01:51:47.319 --> 01:51:49.880]  And I'm telling you, this is going to sell out today.
[01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:52.300]  Why they didn't get 20,000 of them, I don't know.
[01:51:52.439 --> 01:51:53.560]  All my problems would be solved.
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:54.779]  We would have plenty of fun.
[01:51:54.939 --> 01:51:56.539]  This baby is amazing.
[01:51:56.739 --> 01:52:01.899]  Everybody needs to have this original Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:05.800]  Celebrate Christmas with the Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:09.060]  The ultimate conversation starter for your tree or mantle.
[01:52:09.439 --> 01:52:09.699]  Fully...
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:17.199]  Poseable and ready to take on the globalist, this festive figure can be positioned in any stance, from bold and defiant to perfectly perched.
[01:52:17.340 --> 01:52:25.380]  Whether you're decking the halls or making a statement, this patriotic decoration will keep the spirit of 1776 alive all season long, right into Trump getting inaugurated next month.
[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:27.180]  Get your Trump on a stump now!
[01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:35.420]  Ultimate CMOS, Patriot Year, amazing hoodies, Christmas sweaters and more, and fund the second American Revolution worldwide at the Alex Jones store dot com.
[01:52:44.729 --> 01:53:00.430]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, transmitting worldwide in defense of liberty and resistance to tyranny, and it is you, the audience of activists that hold us in position as the sentinel.
[01:53:00.689 --> 01:53:02.550]  This is your fortress.
[01:53:02.890 --> 01:53:05.010]  This is your weapon system of truth.
[01:53:05.250 --> 01:53:12.149]  This is your defense system.
[01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:14.739]  And I thank you for keeping us on air.
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:17.479]  All right.
[01:53:18.659 --> 01:53:21.640]  Let's play a clip of the idiot.
[01:53:22.539 --> 01:53:23.720]  He knows he's an idiot.
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:24.840]  He knows what he's doing.
[01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:27.920]  Neil Segras Tyson on Piers Morgan.
[01:53:28.699 --> 01:53:34.359]  He's under a lot of attacks saying women that are the same size as a man are just as strong on average.
[01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:35.819]  That is not true.
[01:53:35.979 --> 01:53:36.680]  I've got the studies right here.
[01:53:36.819 --> 01:53:39.760]  Men are on average twice as strong pound for pound.
[01:53:40.569 --> 01:53:42.270]  So a little guy and a little woman, man.
[01:53:42.909 --> 01:53:45.710]  Big woman, man the same size.
[01:53:45.989 --> 01:53:46.609]  Middle-sized man.
[01:53:47.090 --> 01:53:47.710]  Twice as strong.
[01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:50.390]  I mean, they got a uterus.
[01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:51.510]  We can't make babies.
[01:53:54.069 --> 01:53:55.710]  I mean, it's just...
[01:53:55.710 --> 01:54:00.109]  It'd be like saying with lions that the females are as strong as the male.
[01:54:01.529 --> 01:54:05.390]  A male lion, on average, is twice as strong as the female.
[01:54:05.630 --> 01:54:07.010]  That's how it works in mammals.
[01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:08.430]  Did you know that?
[01:54:09.409 --> 01:54:09.850]  Nope.
[01:54:11.470 --> 01:54:14.550]  A female lion is as strong as a male lion.
[01:54:14.689 --> 01:54:15.909]  In fact, there's no difference between them.
[01:54:16.050 --> 01:54:20.149]  I mean, imagine if you were watching David Attenborough on BBC say that.
[01:54:20.210 --> 01:54:21.630]  You'd go, who is this lunatic?
[01:54:25.170 --> 01:54:27.250]  Here is Neal Zagrass Tyson.
[01:54:28.119 --> 01:54:46.500]  What I said was, the idea of creating categories within a sport, splitting them, in the example I gave, which I just made it up, like hormone ratios, is not fundamentally weird compared to dividing wrestlers by weight.
[01:54:46.750 --> 01:54:51.310]  Because the only reason why you do this is to make an interesting contest.
[01:54:51.489 --> 01:54:54.609]  And so you said Floyd Merriweather fighting a woman.
[01:54:54.609 --> 01:55:05.569]  You're not allowing for the superior male biology when it comes to lung capacity, stamina, to body mass, to muscle mass, all those things.
[01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:09.649]  If you just take one criteria of hormones, you're not allowing all that.
[01:55:09.949 --> 01:55:10.609]  I'll give an example.
[01:55:10.789 --> 01:55:11.470]  Caitlyn Jenner.
[01:55:11.810 --> 01:55:15.310]  Who obviously, hang on, hang on, let me finish my point.
[01:55:15.569 --> 01:55:19.970]  Caitlyn Jenner was a Olympic male decathlon gold medal winner.
[01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:22.329]  Caitlyn is a big golf fan.
[01:55:22.609 --> 01:55:31.329]  And when she started playing golf after she transitioned, She was allowed to play off the women's tees, which are 50 yards further than the men's tees.
[01:55:31.470 --> 01:55:38.989]  And she quickly realized that she was still smashing it 300 yards down, and obviously was then beating all the women that she played.
[01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:44.050]  So she now plays back off the male tees because her biology is that of a man.
[01:55:44.210 --> 01:55:47.909]  And I feel that that was the most honest way to deal with it.
[01:55:48.090 --> 01:55:51.569]  I also feel that if you want to have a separate category, have a trans category.
[01:55:52.239 --> 01:55:56.279]  Or have trans women compete against men, which is their biology.
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:59.460]  Isn't that the scientific way to resolve this?
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:02.739]  All right, I don't say this to be mean.
[01:56:02.739 --> 01:56:03.840]  I'm saying this to be scientific.
[01:56:04.399 --> 01:56:09.760]  And any real scientist or biologist will tell you this.
[01:56:11.479 --> 01:56:13.340]  We need a mutant category.
[01:56:14.939 --> 01:56:17.520]  I mean, that's what these people are.
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:18.859]  I mean, some of them are just freaks.
[01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:23.909]  But, no, we've been directed evolution, de-evolution.
[01:56:25.369 --> 01:56:30.010]  You know, if there's a big nuclear war, there'll be a lot of mutants later, a few generations down.
[01:56:30.829 --> 01:56:33.170]  You've got, you know, seven fingers, you know, whatever.
[01:56:33.930 --> 01:56:34.890]  Penis and a vagina.
[01:56:35.130 --> 01:56:36.590]  But the chemicals do other things.
[01:56:36.710 --> 01:56:38.489]  So we just need a mutant category.
[01:56:38.670 --> 01:56:42.649]  But what we really need to do is take all this stuff out of the food supply.
[01:56:42.829 --> 01:56:46.090]  We'll be right back with Mike Adams with massive breaking news.
[01:56:46.210 --> 01:56:46.689]  Stay with us.
[01:56:51.539 --> 01:56:55.720]  Our spirit that God made and our connection to the creator of the universe and our children.
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:57:00.520]  And this is the genesis point of the new revolution of information.
[01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:07.399]  I will always believe and I will always say in public that Alex Jones is the most extraordinary person I've ever met.
[01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:10.659]  I'll tell you, that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:13.319]  Alex Jones has been right a lot of times.
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:16.279]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:19.979]  Fluoride, just like Alex Jones was saying, not good, it's crazy.
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:27.340]  The real war's here with the globalists and Soros and Obama and the new world order and BlackRock.
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:30.939]  They've declared war on us and we accept the challenge.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:39.739]  Alex Jones dot network is tomorrow's news today.
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:57.539]  Well, one of my favorite guests, one of my favorite Texans, the great Mike Adams of naturalnews.com, known this guy 15 plus years, joins us and he comes to us from his studios right outside Austin, Texas at his farm, ranch and giant research scientific facility.
[01:57:59.450 --> 01:58:02.069]  And he's also a scientist and bestselling author, as you know.
[01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:05.350]  I want to cover the waterfront in this hour with him.
[01:58:06.270 --> 01:58:09.710]  I want to look at what's happening with Trump, what's happening with the war.
[01:58:09.909 --> 01:58:11.310]  Just briefly hit on these topics.
[01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:21.750]  I want to get into, obviously, the big rollout of all these hysterical pandemics and Hotez, the new Fauci saying, oh, it's going to come crashing down on Trump.
[01:58:21.869 --> 01:58:22.869]  We'll control his administration.
[01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:27.350]  The mystery disease X in the Congo.
[01:58:27.770 --> 01:58:29.729]  The bird flu is about to jump into humans.
[01:58:29.909 --> 01:58:32.069]  And, oh, they're turning the PCR test up.
[01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.989]  And just all of it.
[01:58:33.069 --> 01:58:38.130]  And the different tracks that the globalists have to drive Trump from office.
[01:58:38.689 --> 01:58:40.310]  False flags against migrants.
[01:58:40.329 --> 01:58:42.069]  They already basically said that's going to happen.
[01:58:43.409 --> 01:58:45.170]  Democrat states and they're going to secede.
[01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:47.109]  There's that track of civil war.
[01:58:47.289 --> 01:58:49.810]  There's the nuclear war, World War III track.
[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:53.899]  There is the track with the pandemic.
[01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:56.220]  We're here now.
[01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:59.800]  And then he's got a bunch of other key topics that he wants to get into.
[01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:01.100]  And...
[01:59:02.119 --> 01:59:03.000]  There's a lot here.
[01:59:03.220 --> 01:59:04.079]  We're going to look at the omniverse.
[01:59:04.239 --> 01:59:12.340]  We're going to look at the population agenda shifting to overt phase in 2025, humanoid robot world simulators, and the coming AI revolution.
[01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:14.739]  So, Mike, you're welcome to start anywhere you want.
[01:59:15.359 --> 01:59:20.880]  You always are very thought-provoking, and I appreciate you coming on to just cover the waterfront.
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:26.909]  But just briefly, because people want to know, and I haven't talked about it in about an hour and a half, And I haven't talked to you.
[01:59:27.229 --> 01:59:30.789]  I asked the producer to get you on a few days ago, but I haven't talked to you in months in person.
[01:59:30.850 --> 01:59:32.210]  We should get dinner or something.
[01:59:32.630 --> 01:59:36.810]  But I always really respect your view of things, and it tends to be right almost all the time.
[01:59:36.949 --> 01:59:45.229]  What do you make of the attempts to shut down Infowars three times by the Justice Department in the last seven months, and what this judge did, and where this is going?
[01:59:45.890 --> 01:59:50.590]  I mean, I see it as a pretty big canary in the coal mine that the tide's starting to turn on a lot of fronts on lawfare.
[01:59:50.789 --> 01:59:53.270]  Just a few minutes on that, because personally, I want to know what you think.
[01:59:54.140 --> 02:00:00.279]  Well, first of all, by the way, congratulations on your personal transformation, your physical transformation.
[02:00:01.220 --> 02:00:02.340]  You're putting in the work.
[02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:03.199]  It's working.
[02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:04.420]  Everybody can see it.
[02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:11.380]  You're looking lean and strong and you know what it takes because you've done that so many times before and so you're an inspiration.
[02:00:11.619 --> 02:00:12.600]  So keep it up.
[02:00:12.699 --> 02:00:14.000]  Awesome, awesome job right there.
[02:00:14.539 --> 02:00:18.479]  To get your question about Infowars, I even tweeted about this yesterday.
[02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:24.180]  I said, finally, some sense of rationality is starting to emerge in the court system.
[02:00:24.619 --> 02:00:34.119]  And, you know, in context, as you well know, the entire trial against free speech systems was, in my view, completely rigged.
[02:00:34.279 --> 02:00:35.539]  It was extra judicial.
[02:00:35.899 --> 02:00:37.760]  You never got a trial by jury.
[02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:42.939]  It was, you know, the judge announced that you were guilty without a trial, you know, on and on and on.
[02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:45.279]  All of due process was violated.
[02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:51.500]  In the effort to get you, and it was all deep state pushed, as we know, because of videos that have come out, etc.
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:58.539]  So the fact that right now, I think because of the victory of Trump, we're starting to see the deep state panic.
[02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:10.720]  And they're starting to, I think, arm twist the judges a little bit less now, allowing some logic to emerge, which is what just happened, I believe, in the decision yesterday.
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:14.659]  To essentially vacate that fake auction.
[02:01:14.939 --> 02:01:17.380]  So I'm very curious about where it's gonna go from here.
[02:01:17.779 --> 02:01:21.180]  But of course, prayers toward the future.
[02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:25.479]  I hope that friendly forces can maintain control over InfoWars.
[02:01:25.699 --> 02:01:42.550]  Along those same lines, Alex, understand the State Department has decided it's going to dismantle the GEC. This is one of the key censorship engines that was funded with over $100 million and that laundered censorship efforts through NGOs overseas,
[02:01:42.729 --> 02:01:47.869]  especially in the UK, which then pushed those demands back to big tech platforms in the United States.
[02:01:48.590 --> 02:01:58.409]  Now, in my lawsuit, our Brighton Systems lawsuit filed this year, we sued the State Department, we sued the DOD, we sued Google, Facebook, and so on.
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:05.560]  And specifically, the smoking gun evidence came out of this State Department group that is now being dismantled.
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:12.920]  So they are running scared, understanding that the court systems are no longer going to cover up their crimes.
[02:02:13.079 --> 02:02:23.109]  We believe we're going to get a fair hearing in court now, just as finally yesterday for the first time you got What seems to be a fair hearing by that judge.
[02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:25.590]  And so the tide is turning.
[02:02:25.829 --> 02:02:26.689]  Things have changed.
[02:02:26.890 --> 02:02:35.829]  And if Mr. Carr as FCC gets nominated and into power, he's gonna push back hard against censorship.
[02:02:36.170 --> 02:02:52.890]  And the Trump administration throughout every department, even the head of FBI, Kash Patel and so on, Even head of DOJ, they're gonna push back hard against these censorship efforts that are unconstitutional, un-American, and that contributed to the harm and deaths of,
[02:02:53.050 --> 02:03:07.390]  I believe, millions of Americans during the COVID years when our voices of truth and reason were silenced on purpose by a malicious FDA that was attacking ivermectin while you and I, Alex, were advocating ivermectin.
[02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:12.270]  You were eating ivermectin on camera to show people I was taking ivermectin.
[02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:16.619]  We helped save lives, but we could have helped save a lot more without the censorship.
[02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:25.840]  And it turned out 2.4 billion was serially given by the federal government to the major pharmacies, CBS and Walgreens and others, to not prescribe it.
[02:03:26.140 --> 02:03:27.939]  And now federal courts have ruled it does work.
[02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:28.600]  We were right.
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:29.279]  It was criminal.
[02:03:30.819 --> 02:03:31.340]  Exactly.
[02:03:31.819 --> 02:03:34.539]  So understand, people died because of censorship.
[02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:37.000]  People died because of censorship.
[02:03:37.759 --> 02:03:43.060]  And they want to say that you're bad because you questioned Sandy Hook narratives?
[02:03:43.319 --> 02:03:45.560]  No, you were right to question everything.
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:47.899]  We are all right to question everything.
[02:03:48.039 --> 02:03:52.920]  Doesn't mean we always get it 100% correct, but to question is always correct.
[02:03:54.119 --> 02:04:06.439]  What we did not engage in, which is what the government did, is malicious censorship as violence to kill people by denying them access to information that could have saved their lives.
[02:04:06.579 --> 02:04:18.420]  And I believe that Trump's victory is going to put an end to that, especially if we get RFK Jr. in as head of HHS, which I am strongly advocating for RFK Jr. in that position.
[02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:20.960]  And that's why he has so much resistance from Big Pharma.
[02:04:21.159 --> 02:04:22.739]  So that's kind of my...
[02:04:23.170 --> 02:04:25.810]  You know, that's the context of, I think, what we're gonna talk about here today.
[02:04:26.029 --> 02:04:27.729]  You want me to go into the pandemic next?
[02:04:28.369 --> 02:04:30.149]  I was about to say, yes, please.
[02:04:31.250 --> 02:04:42.869]  Okay, all right, so of course you've covered the Peter Hotez video where he essentially promised all these viruses and pandemics that are going to magically appear the day after Trump is sworn in.
[02:04:43.050 --> 02:04:49.149]  So we know now looking at Joe Biden potentially offering a pardon to Fauci.
[02:04:49.630 --> 02:04:54.869]  I've joked and said, well, it's Fauci's freezer that's about to be unleashed on America.
[02:04:54.869 --> 02:05:08.649]  So just like With Hunter Biden being given a pardon after 10% for the big guy, money laundering through Ukraine, but the guy that receives the 10%, Joe Biden, he gets to cover up the crimes by pardoning his son.
[02:05:08.949 --> 02:05:16.949]  He, I believe, is going to pardon Fauci, even as the Fauci bioweapons, which are really, I believe, more contact poisons.
[02:05:16.949 --> 02:05:17.909]  We can talk about that.
[02:05:18.319 --> 02:05:30.800]  But the bioweapons crimes that are about to be committed and unleashed against America in 2025 are going to be preemptively covered up through pardons by Joe Biden.
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:41.989]  So not only are they going to attack America with poisons and weapons and sheddings, And more vaccine mandates and try to blame it all on Trump once again.
[02:05:42.250 --> 02:05:45.270]  They are also covering up their own crimes with pardons.
[02:05:45.529 --> 02:05:54.930]  So it is critical that the new head of the DOJ understands just because somebody is pardoned doesn't mean they can't be prosecuted.
[02:05:55.130 --> 02:05:57.010]  They can still be prosecuted.
[02:05:57.130 --> 02:06:00.390]  They just can't actually serve a sentence that's handed down to them.
[02:06:00.859 --> 02:06:02.260]  They can still be investigated.
[02:06:02.399 --> 02:06:10.239]  There can still be civil lawsuits against them for their alleged crimes or their involvement in bioweapons or the mass killing of the American people.
[02:06:10.479 --> 02:06:12.300]  A pardon does not stop that.
[02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:21.380]  And Alex, I would argue that Joe Biden's pardons are null and void because fraud vitiates everything and Joe Biden was never elected president.
[02:06:21.539 --> 02:06:23.180]  It was rigged from the start.
[02:06:24.010 --> 02:06:27.390]  Everything that Joe Biden signed is technically null and void.
[02:06:27.630 --> 02:06:33.550]  Every executive order, every law that he signed is null and void because he was never elected president.
[02:06:33.829 --> 02:06:36.250]  And more truth has come out about that.
[02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:44.029]  So, yes, disease X, they're pushing that now in the Congo regions, and they're trying to build a narrative.
[02:06:44.289 --> 02:06:51.710]  They're going to push the low-hanging fruit of gullible, obedient people into another round of vaccine euthanasia.
[02:06:52.720 --> 02:07:00.060]  But my prediction is, and this is why I sent you documents about the robots and the AI training world simulator.
[02:07:00.990 --> 02:07:14.829]  What's going to happen, I believe, in 2025 is that the depopulation agenda will begin to transition from the covert phase, which is the hidden form of it where, hey, we're trying to help you take these shots.
[02:07:14.989 --> 02:07:15.949]  They're good for you.
[02:07:16.050 --> 02:07:17.010]  They'll stop infections.
[02:07:17.170 --> 02:07:18.069]  They'll stop transmissions.
[02:07:18.229 --> 02:07:19.189]  We're the good guys.
[02:07:19.329 --> 02:07:20.090]  Big Pharma loves you.
[02:07:20.170 --> 02:07:20.989]  Government loves you, right?
[02:07:21.189 --> 02:07:22.229]  All of that nonsense.
[02:07:22.890 --> 02:07:24.149]  That's what it has been.
[02:07:24.529 --> 02:07:40.050]  Soon, in the next two years, depends on the timeline of the humanoid robots, it's going to shift into the overt phase, where they drop the facade, they no longer pretend they're trying to help you, they're just literally out to kill you, to exterminate you,
[02:07:40.170 --> 02:07:43.090]  to achieve global depopulation, and they don't care if you know.
[02:07:43.329 --> 02:07:56.029]  And the reason this shift is happening is largely because of, you know, websites like yours, your broadcast, my broadcast, others in independent media, We, collectively, all of us together, we red-pilled so many people.
[02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.949]  Well, that's another point.
[02:07:56.949 --> 02:07:59.750]  Let me interject your take on this, and please continue with your excellent breakdown.
[02:08:01.770 --> 02:08:18.550]  Separate from Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, all that, Elon Musk on many fronts exposing the globalists, while in some areas obviously involved heavily in those industries that are inducive to a larger plan, But looking at this,
[02:08:19.029 --> 02:08:22.869]  all the most popular talk show hosts now around the world are anti-globalists.
[02:08:22.970 --> 02:08:25.109]  Then in Romania, an anti-globalist gets elected.
[02:08:25.310 --> 02:08:25.770]  Super hardcore.
[02:08:25.989 --> 02:08:26.949]  Sounds like you or me.
[02:08:27.329 --> 02:08:31.250]  Then NATO just disregards it and has a coup and says your elections don't matter now.
[02:08:31.609 --> 02:08:33.729]  I mean, this is explosive.
[02:08:34.210 --> 02:08:40.010]  There is an exponential awakening to team humanity versus team dehumanization, team death cult.
[02:08:41.910 --> 02:08:45.369]  I mean, the Great Awakening is in full explosive bloom right now.
[02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:49.189]  We're only in the first phases of this, and it's moving very quickly.
[02:08:49.310 --> 02:08:50.149]  I think you agree with that.
[02:08:50.449 --> 02:08:53.550]  But the globalists are obviously going to counter it with global crises and other things.
[02:08:53.609 --> 02:09:01.020]  But how would you describe the moment When we've gone directly into the heart of the zeitgeist, what you and I do.
[02:09:01.439 --> 02:09:05.819]  And again, it's very heartening, but it shows our real research is just assessing the real world.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.680]  Something that the globalists just try to deny and not look at.
[02:09:08.779 --> 02:09:09.539]  There's no global government.
[02:09:09.659 --> 02:09:10.619]  There's no transhumanism.
[02:09:10.779 --> 02:09:11.939]  Now they're like, hell yeah, it's here.
[02:09:12.020 --> 02:09:15.640]  I mean, I think you're saying the answer is they're just going to become completely uncloaked.
[02:09:16.859 --> 02:09:18.460]  This is the collapse of the matrix.
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:29.520]  So we've all been living in this artificial world with artificial history, artificial news, artificial elections, fake science, fake medicine, fake vaccines, fake pandemics, all of it.
[02:09:29.739 --> 02:09:44.220]  And this matrix system in which we've been existing, just like in the movie The Matrix, we have been tapped and exploited for our human brainpower, our human labor, and for our support of a system that enslaves us.
[02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:53.739]  And just like in the matrix, a lot of people don't want to have their matrix challenged because it's too shocking to think about surviving outside of that system.
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:56.199]  But now the matrix is collapsing.
[02:09:57.250 --> 02:10:01.590]  All the official narratives upon which modern culture has been based.
[02:10:01.829 --> 02:10:03.569]  The narrative that government is good.
[02:10:03.829 --> 02:10:07.170]  The narrative that science is trustworthy and self-correcting.
[02:10:07.250 --> 02:10:08.729]  What a joke that has become.
[02:10:08.949 --> 02:10:12.529]  The narrative that drug companies want to help you heal and so on.
[02:10:12.970 --> 02:10:15.829]  And that hospitals want to help you get better.
[02:10:16.079 --> 02:10:20.760]  Actually, they're being paid to murder you, and then they collect up to half a million dollars as an incentive.
[02:10:20.939 --> 02:10:32.699]  So all these narratives, even faith in the education system, faith in churches, mainstream churches that have turned against the teachings of Christ also, all that trust is shattering.
[02:10:32.949 --> 02:10:40.310]  As a result, the matrix worldview, which has been a kind of cultural simulation, is collapsing.
[02:10:40.569 --> 02:10:52.949]  From this point forward, now humanity is going to go through a time of great chaos, and there will be some substantial die-off that happens here coming very, very soon for reasons that we can discuss.
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:57.199]  And part of that is because a lot of people don't realize where we are in history.
[02:10:57.420 --> 02:11:00.020]  They still think we're living in 1994 or whatever.
[02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:04.119]  They probably won't survive if they don't wake up and realize what's happening.
[02:11:04.279 --> 02:11:06.460]  But your viewers will survive.
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:07.859]  They're well informed.
[02:11:08.020 --> 02:11:08.899]  They're capable.
[02:11:09.180 --> 02:11:09.979]  They're thinkers.
[02:11:10.439 --> 02:11:12.699]  And that's gonna represent the future of humanity.
[02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:15.579]  And the future, I believe, Alex, this is critical.
[02:11:15.939 --> 02:11:21.739]  We are going to see the end of many centralized systems of control over humanity.
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:26.439]  We can build a future that is decentralized.
[02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:37.779]  We can build a future with decentralized money, which is where crypto comes in, decentralized knowledge, which is where, by the way, open source AI engines like the one I've been working on for over a year.
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:39.100]  I'll tell you about that later.
[02:11:40.279 --> 02:11:43.420]  And I'm also training on some of your material, by the way, that's very interesting.
[02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:50.619]  It's had a lot of trouble with some of the dialogue coming out of Infowars, but it's because of the programming that we are overwriting.
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:12:00.800]  So the future can be decentralized knowledge and Part of this is like what RFK Jr. needs to do is get into HHS and radically reform that.
[02:12:01.039 --> 02:12:03.739]  For example, we don't need an NIH at all.
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:10.600]  We don't need governments funding scientific research because when governments do that, they demand the results they want in advance.
[02:12:10.899 --> 02:12:16.140]  They say here, here's $10 million, find me evidence of climate change.
[02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:23.810]  And then that's what they get, a thousand studies every month about climate change, all government funded, but all nonsense, all complete nonsense.
[02:12:24.250 --> 02:12:30.369]  So centralized control is what is actually dissolving in this pivotal moment for human history.
[02:12:30.369 --> 02:12:37.369]  And we are moving into the world of decentralization, which is why we need to free Roger Ver, by the way.
[02:12:37.659 --> 02:12:39.800]  Who, you know, Bitcoin Jesus is his nickname.
[02:12:40.060 --> 02:12:44.859]  He is a champion of decentralization, and he's being persecuted by the Justice Department.
[02:12:45.039 --> 02:12:46.720]  They want to put him in prison for life.
[02:12:46.859 --> 02:12:51.199]  He didn't do anything wrong, but he's an advocate of self-custody of your crypto.
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:56.439]  You're absolutely right, and we understand the future is decentralization.
[02:12:56.819 --> 02:12:58.800]  The globalists want centralization.
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.520]  We need decentralization of everything.
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:02.859]  That is freedom.
[02:13:04.289 --> 02:13:04.969]  100%.
[02:13:04.969 --> 02:13:11.630]  And every crisis that the government engineers is a way to re-centralize control.
[02:13:11.989 --> 02:13:19.869]  Every war, every panic, every fear that they can push is a means to scare people back into obedience.
[02:13:20.109 --> 02:13:21.069]  That's all it is.
[02:13:21.250 --> 02:13:30.289]  And the number one thing that the people watching this need to understand about what's about to happen in 2025 is that most of it is illusion.
[02:13:31.079 --> 02:13:38.640]  You're gonna see videos probably on CNN of people with the next virus, disease X. They're gonna be bleeding out of their eyeballs and ears.
[02:13:39.020 --> 02:13:43.020]  And you're gonna be told you have to go to the hospital and get this vaccine or you might die too.
[02:13:43.439 --> 02:13:45.319]  You need to look at that and say, nope.
[02:13:46.039 --> 02:13:46.680]  That's staged.
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:47.859]  That's a contact poison.
[02:13:48.079 --> 02:13:51.659]  I mean, yeah, that person is actually bleeding out, but that's because they were poisoned.
[02:13:51.819 --> 02:13:59.500]  There was a dispersed contact poison that was put into the subway system or wherever, maybe New York City, wherever, and a bunch of people got sick.
[02:13:59.500 --> 02:14:00.300]  It's not a germ.
[02:14:00.420 --> 02:14:01.180]  It's not a virus.
[02:14:01.340 --> 02:14:02.220]  I don't need a vaccine.
[02:14:02.420 --> 02:14:08.520]  No, I totally, or they can do what they did all over the world from Singapore to the U.S., I think?
[02:14:24.460 --> 02:14:28.300]  It's a PSYOP. All of it's a PSYOP. And they're gonna amp it up.
[02:14:28.380 --> 02:14:30.439]  And you've seen all these mystery drones flying around.
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:31.619]  You've reported on that.
[02:14:31.779 --> 02:14:35.220]  They might do a faked alien invasion mothership in the sky.
[02:14:35.399 --> 02:14:35.739]  Who knows?
[02:14:36.020 --> 02:14:56.380]  But understand, 2025, once Trump is sworn in, Starting January 21st, just like Hotez said, they're going to unleash every false flag, every psyop, every illusion they can to try to convince people to be afraid and to reject their own power and to put power back in trusted systems,
[02:14:56.380 --> 02:14:57.840]  which none of us trust anymore.
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:14:58.199]  Exactly.
[02:14:58.319 --> 02:15:01.260]  So COVID failed and blew up in their face as a psyop for control.
[02:15:02.039 --> 02:15:03.960]  And so now they're hitting everything.
[02:15:04.460 --> 02:15:07.180]  I mean, there's clearly a soft launch of Bluebeam going on.
[02:15:07.300 --> 02:15:11.020]  And the corporate media and the FBI and the Pentagon saying, we don't know where these drones came from.
[02:15:11.119 --> 02:15:11.859]  We don't know what's going on.
[02:15:11.939 --> 02:15:12.779]  They're all behind it.
[02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:15.899]  Now they're claiming Iran might be behind it with no evidence.
[02:15:16.039 --> 02:15:18.159]  We'll cover that in detail towards the end of the hour, but please continue.
[02:15:19.140 --> 02:15:28.399]  Yeah, when you think about these large drones the size of cars are flying around over US Air Force bases for weeks.
[02:15:28.850 --> 02:15:31.090]  And the Air Force doesn't do anything to stop them?
[02:15:31.229 --> 02:15:31.729]  I mean, come on.
[02:15:31.989 --> 02:15:32.470]  What are we talking about?
[02:15:32.470 --> 02:15:32.550]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:32.550 --> 02:15:35.130]  Let me tell people that aren't pilots or don't know the default law.
[02:15:35.369 --> 02:15:41.109]  If a plane of any size is flying around in restricted airspace, F-16s or others are launched within minutes.
[02:15:41.489 --> 02:15:42.869]  They get directed to land.
[02:15:42.869 --> 02:15:47.510]  And when they don't land, they then try to get a visual to see if the person's passed out or died.
[02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:55.470]  And if not, and that person is obviously in the cockpit alive, they shoot it down with Sidewinder, Or with Sparrow missiles.
[02:15:55.689 --> 02:15:56.470]  That is default.
[02:15:56.890 --> 02:15:59.329]  So huge drones over nuclear weapons bases.
[02:15:59.970 --> 02:16:03.770]  Those are DARPA. Those are NASA. Those are the Pentagon.
[02:16:04.170 --> 02:16:06.050]  Now the people at the base aren't being told that.
[02:16:06.229 --> 02:16:08.810]  So when they come out and say, we don't know what they are, it's because they're not being told.
[02:16:08.930 --> 02:16:09.829]  This is ridiculous.
[02:16:10.149 --> 02:16:11.930]  And people see all these, it looks like craft.
[02:16:12.109 --> 02:16:15.109]  It's a bunch of drones flying in unison just like China does publicly.
[02:16:15.689 --> 02:16:18.250]  And they just make it look like a flying saucer.
[02:16:18.329 --> 02:16:19.649]  This is ridiculously obvious.
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:26.100]  You've seen the videos of the giant dragon in the sky with all the drones that you were talking about there, right?
[02:16:26.420 --> 02:16:31.579]  So China can launch 10,000 drones that are orchestrated in their light show.
[02:16:31.699 --> 02:16:33.500]  It's really quite astonishing.
[02:16:33.719 --> 02:16:36.459]  But like you said, they can make that into any shape they want.
[02:16:36.579 --> 02:16:39.159]  They can turn it into a giant alien mothership.
[02:16:39.319 --> 02:16:46.360]  They could turn it into the face of Jesus, and they could try to convince the Christians that this is the second coming of Jesus, a booming voice in the sky.
[02:16:46.620 --> 02:16:49.579]  And probably some people would believe that, but you and I know.
[02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:51.600]  No, that's government.
[02:16:52.139 --> 02:16:55.520]  They're doing that to try to, yeah, there's an example right there, right?
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:57.879]  So organized drone flights.
[02:16:58.020 --> 02:17:08.200]  Now, understand, and this kind of segues to what we're going to talk about, especially in the next segment, which is the autonomous killbot systems, or Skynet, becoming reality.
[02:17:08.549 --> 02:17:15.610]  So all of this technology that coordinates these drone swarms in the sky for a light show, this is actually military technology, right?
[02:17:15.889 --> 02:17:27.190]  So this is drone swarm logic and navigation algorithms, communications, payload lifting, battery life, navigation, all these things, so that they can be used to do what?
[02:17:27.329 --> 02:17:28.329]  To kill humans.
[02:17:28.549 --> 02:17:30.110]  That's exactly what this is.
[02:17:30.250 --> 02:17:36.930]  Every light show that you see right now in the coming years, it will be a bomb show or a kamikaze drone show.
[02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:39.860]  And they will all have thermal cameras.
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:44.020]  They'll be able to spot human beings and they'll track you by your mobile phone.
[02:17:44.649 --> 02:17:56.590]  So wherever you are, just like the J6 people were tracked by their mobile phone geolocation metadata, and that's why they're in prison now, because they had their phones with them, and the cell towers were spying on them.
[02:17:56.889 --> 02:17:58.129]  Well, guess what?
[02:17:58.229 --> 02:18:06.930]  The drones are gonna have access to all your mobile phone metadata geolocation data, and that's how they know where you are, and they'll come in and bomb you.
[02:18:08.149 --> 02:18:16.610]  Or they'll have the dog drones, the doggy robots on the ground that will be able to traverse terrain and enter homes and things like that.
[02:18:16.770 --> 02:18:19.510]  So that's the warfare against humanity that's coming next.
[02:18:19.629 --> 02:18:24.409]  And that is, again, what I call the overt stage of the extermination agenda.
[02:18:24.590 --> 02:18:28.510]  So Skynet is about to become real in 2025 and beyond.
[02:18:29.129 --> 02:18:37.969]  We'll lay that out when we come back, but I'm gonna show folks some amazing Human military drones.
[02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:40.770]  And again, a lot of this is showing Russia, hey, we got this.
[02:18:41.409 --> 02:18:42.409]  China shows it all.
[02:18:42.510 --> 02:18:43.549]  The US isn't showing it.
[02:18:43.610 --> 02:18:44.329]  Europe's not showing it.
[02:18:44.430 --> 02:18:46.069]  But you can look at them.
[02:18:46.129 --> 02:18:46.790]  I'll show the footage.
[02:18:46.909 --> 02:18:47.510]  It's drones.
[02:18:47.729 --> 02:18:55.930]  And you got congressmen and senators and governors and state reps going, I saw the UFO and then the light turned off when it saw me.
[02:18:57.099 --> 02:19:03.120]  And you can even hear them with their jet engines, some of the bigger ones, and it's human craft.
[02:19:03.299 --> 02:19:06.860]  And again, you see the different ways the Chinese just show it off.
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:09.399]  Here they go, we don't know what this is.
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:11.920]  And I've seen this decades ago.
[02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:13.500]  One time I was out of Monument Valley, Utah.
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:15.100]  Gosh, decades ago.
[02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:15.860]  It was like 30 years ago.
[02:19:15.979 --> 02:19:16.319]  I was like...
[02:19:17.209 --> 02:19:20.770]  Like, 19. And I saw these going around.
[02:19:20.850 --> 02:19:28.110]  And you could hear their engines, and then you could tell they've got, you know, not even anti-grab, they've got propellers that aren't as loud, you know, when they hover.
[02:19:28.530 --> 02:19:32.250]  But it's just similar to more advanced, you know, Harrier jump jets.
[02:19:32.629 --> 02:19:34.430]  We'll talk about this and more when we come back.
[02:19:34.430 --> 02:19:34.950]  Stay with us.
[02:19:35.159 --> 02:19:42.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, my fellow patriots, it's December 2024, and that means it's Christmas at InfoWars.
[02:19:42.479 --> 02:19:47.700]  And our big present, President Trump, about to be in office in just a few weeks.
[02:19:47.819 --> 02:19:52.659]  Now, let me show you some of the amazing designs that are limited edition right now at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:53.739]  Talk about fun.
[02:19:53.879 --> 02:19:56.040]  Talk about a conversation piece.
[02:19:56.159 --> 02:19:59.620]  Talk about a way to trigger liberals and find fellow patriots on the street.
[02:20:00.959 --> 02:20:06.100]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the Alex Jones Rampant Christmas Sweater.
[02:20:06.219 --> 02:20:09.700]  Ah, then of course there's the Darth Sidious Hoodies.
[02:20:09.979 --> 02:20:11.899]  Trump won, I'm afraid.
[02:20:12.729 --> 02:20:17.370]  Now, out of the hundreds of amazing designs, the AlexShoneStore.com, I knew this would be popular.
[02:20:17.489 --> 02:20:19.370]  It turns out it is one of the top five bestsellers.
[02:20:19.590 --> 02:20:22.750]  Trump, 2024. Better coverage than Verizon.
[02:20:22.989 --> 02:20:24.129]  Can you hear us now?
[02:20:24.350 --> 02:20:27.409]  And the AlexShoneStore.com has brought back a fan favorite.
[02:20:27.530 --> 02:20:29.590]  We haven't had this shirt for five, six, seven years.
[02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:33.149]  It's the classic InfoWars because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:20:33.450 --> 02:20:38.229]  And then we've got the alchemy of the deadly chemical accuracy bending our genders and the frogs' genders.
[02:20:38.430 --> 02:20:40.930]  The frogs go through the prism and they come out.
[02:20:41.069 --> 02:20:42.389]  Well, you know the rest of the story.
[02:20:42.709 --> 02:20:49.069]  And who can forget the chart that saved President Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania when he turned his head on the right wing of the chart?
[02:20:49.649 --> 02:20:50.770]  Everybody's got to get one of these.
[02:20:50.950 --> 02:20:52.250]  I predict it'll be a bestseller.
[02:20:52.510 --> 02:20:56.149]  Donald Trump reborn as a Jack Daniels bottle.
[02:20:56.350 --> 02:20:57.909]  This is going to be a bestseller as well.
[02:20:58.030 --> 02:21:00.110]  If you're blown away by these designs, this is just a few of them.
[02:21:00.290 --> 02:21:03.270]  There's over 200 designs right now at theauctionstore.com.
[02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:05.190]  Get them, spread the word, and keep us on the air.
[02:21:05.370 --> 02:21:06.229]  God bless you all.
[02:21:06.229 --> 02:21:07.149]  Have a wonderful Christmas.
[02:21:09.239 --> 02:21:10.620]  Ho ho ho!
[02:21:10.959 --> 02:21:12.379]  Merry Christmas!
[02:21:35.239 --> 02:21:53.239]  I remember being 11 years old 40 years ago, and my dad just had all these books by patriots, by anti-globalists, and he also had books by Zbigniew Brzezinski and everything else just everywhere.
[02:21:54.139 --> 02:21:58.219]  And I remember starting to read those and like, wow, this is fantastical.
[02:21:59.310 --> 02:22:14.030]  And, you know, reading about, oh, different proposals by UN officials about using an alien invasion, a fake one, to unify the Earth, or an anti-asteroid global government, you know, pushing global government, the name of that.
[02:22:14.190 --> 02:22:16.610]  So that's why I got into researching this.
[02:22:16.670 --> 02:22:17.530]  It was so fascinating.
[02:22:17.530 --> 02:22:21.030]  I'm like, these aren't, like, fantasy, like, comic books that I liked.
[02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:24.069]  And I'd read, like, the, you know, 1930s Conan books.
[02:22:24.489 --> 02:22:24.889]  Yeah.
[02:22:26.180 --> 02:22:27.000]  Written here in Texas.
[02:22:27.159 --> 02:22:28.020]  I mean, I was into all that.
[02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:28.760]  I was a big reader.
[02:22:28.860 --> 02:22:30.200]  By the time I was like six, I was a great reader.
[02:22:30.899 --> 02:22:34.399]  But I kind of got out of fiction because reality was so much more interesting.
[02:22:35.420 --> 02:22:39.420]  And then we saw world leaders talk about how they'd use alien invasion for control.
[02:22:39.680 --> 02:22:40.819]  We're here now.
[02:22:41.260 --> 02:22:46.540]  And I want to get into the biological androids, the drone swarms, this rise of the robots here.
[02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:55.520]  But To see, and I want to show that footage shot here in the United States, and we'll play it with audio here in a minute, of those aircraft, and you can hear the engines.
[02:22:55.780 --> 02:22:57.440]  And then people are like, are those aliens?
[02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:00.219]  And the government then says, we don't know what they are.
[02:23:00.459 --> 02:23:08.879]  So they came out earlier today, mystery New Jersey drones are coming from Iranian mothership offshore, congressman suggests, should be shot down.
[02:23:09.709 --> 02:23:13.229]  Well, the Pentagon doesn't want locals to start taking pot shots at their own aircraft.
[02:23:13.389 --> 02:23:15.149]  And so, oh no!
[02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:17.670]  It's not Iranian, but it's not us.
[02:23:18.709 --> 02:23:25.270]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a giant PSYOP. They are rolling out Bluebeam, the fake alien invasion.
[02:23:25.409 --> 02:23:29.149]  This is the soft rollout or a test rollout, in my humble opinion.
[02:23:30.069 --> 02:23:31.469]  And we are living in history.
[02:23:32.250 --> 02:23:35.250]  So they are, as I predicted, as Mike Adams predicted in the last...
[02:23:37.500 --> 02:23:40.719]  We're good to go.
[02:23:57.959 --> 02:24:00.059]  So, this is it.
[02:24:00.180 --> 02:24:01.120]  And Mike nailed it.
[02:24:01.379 --> 02:24:02.719]  They want your mind.
[02:24:02.719 --> 02:24:04.840]  They want you to be so confused by everything.
[02:24:05.280 --> 02:24:08.000]  And you're so worried about a virus or aliens.
[02:24:08.219 --> 02:24:16.760]  And by the way, the UN, after weeks of the mystery thing, killing hundreds in the Congo, London Guardian, it's malaria.
[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:19.479]  Well, that's far from a mystery disease.
[02:24:20.260 --> 02:24:20.780]  So...
[02:24:22.260 --> 02:24:24.719]  That's one of the oldest documented known diseases.
[02:24:24.940 --> 02:24:29.860]  I mean, you know, this is something, one of the first things they figured out in the theory of microbes was this.
[02:24:30.559 --> 02:24:39.020]  So, not new, not X, but A. So, I want to play with audio, though, because listen to the engines of these.
[02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:44.440]  And then the aircraft go, you know, mock two or three in just seconds and then stop.
[02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:46.379]  And people go, what's that?
[02:24:46.559 --> 02:24:49.739]  Well, it's obviously got multiple propulsion systems.
[02:24:49.860 --> 02:24:50.379]  Here's the video.
[02:25:14.930 --> 02:25:21.889]  I've been around 51 years coming up here in February and I've been all over the country and a lot of places in the world.
[02:25:22.049 --> 02:25:25.850]  I've sat out and been into amateur astronomy and things.
[02:25:26.709 --> 02:25:34.049]  Since I was young, I have, you know, my dad's like, oh, look, there's satellites up there, and you'd see them, you know, when the sun hit them.
[02:25:34.829 --> 02:25:50.409]  But I've also, since I was, you know, 15, 20, I've seen this many times, Utah, Montana, West Texas, go out to Big Bend, you know, some of the darkest skies in North America, and you'll be looking at what looks like a star, and you're sitting out there,
[02:25:50.510 --> 02:25:55.729]  you know, while your telescope, whatever, all of a sudden you see that star move, and then...
[02:25:58.090 --> 02:26:00.489]  You listen to those, those are jet engines, boys and girls.
[02:26:01.370 --> 02:26:01.809]  Alright?
[02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:07.309]  But the governors are like, and then the lights went off when the aliens see us.
[02:26:07.409 --> 02:26:09.129]  So, it's like we're pygmies.
[02:26:10.749 --> 02:26:15.350]  Or the Aztecs, the first time they saw a Spanish ship pull up.
[02:26:15.489 --> 02:26:16.950]  They don't know what to make of it.
[02:26:17.229 --> 02:26:21.110]  But they're treating us like we've got bones in our noses.
[02:26:21.770 --> 02:26:24.469]  It reminds me of Google ten years ago, five years ago.
[02:26:24.549 --> 02:26:27.069]  They'll be in Congress, Mike, as you know, the famous videos.
[02:26:27.450 --> 02:26:31.770]  And the congressman will go, how do I put my name in and see my face?
[02:26:31.850 --> 02:26:33.149]  How'd my granddaughter see that?
[02:26:33.250 --> 02:26:36.569]  I hear you track where I go with the Googler.
[02:26:37.149 --> 02:26:39.469]  And then they had a Google go, sir, we don't track you with Google.
[02:26:39.549 --> 02:26:40.850]  Well, it's the app that does that.
[02:26:40.950 --> 02:26:42.870]  They play that game.
[02:26:43.010 --> 02:26:47.229]  And Congress just now figured out, these things track is how it do that.
[02:26:47.590 --> 02:26:50.770]  And so now they're doing this giant rollout.
[02:26:50.909 --> 02:26:53.969]  They're obviously drones from different sophistications of speeds.
[02:26:54.770 --> 02:26:59.790]  You can see them in formations doing the same thing the Chinese do, as you said, to deceive people.
[02:26:59.950 --> 02:27:01.549]  And then the Pentagon's like, don't shoot them down.
[02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:04.010]  They're actually not the Iranians, but they're not ours either.
[02:27:04.190 --> 02:27:06.829]  I mean, blue beam isn't coming.
[02:27:07.409 --> 02:27:08.930]  We can stick a fork in it.
[02:27:09.030 --> 02:27:10.149]  It's begun, Mike.
[02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:12.569]  The question is, do you agree with me, and how intense will it get?
[02:27:12.649 --> 02:27:13.049]  Please continue.
[02:27:13.959 --> 02:27:14.979]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:20.399]  That is exactly what's coming and what has just happened this calendar year.
[02:27:20.719 --> 02:27:27.819]  So for the rest of history, 2024, the AI infrastructure that emerged will be pivotal.
[02:27:28.139 --> 02:27:35.600]  It will be recognized as a turning point for the future of the world and ultimately what ended up killing billions of people.
[02:27:35.899 --> 02:27:38.680]  So from what you just said there, that's the perfect segue.
[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:49.559]  Those drone swarms, the question is, how are they programmed to exterminate humans, which has long been the goal of globalists and even going back to the Nixon administration.
[02:27:49.780 --> 02:27:53.899]  Let's put infertility chemicals in the food that we export to Africa, etc.
[02:27:54.239 --> 02:27:55.200]  All of that, right?
[02:27:55.379 --> 02:27:56.520]  So it's the same agenda.
[02:27:56.680 --> 02:27:58.059]  Now they have a new way to do it.
[02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:00.979]  So let me explain something that's just earth shattering.
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.020]  It's gonna take me just a couple of minutes to explain.
[02:28:03.260 --> 02:28:11.159]  And this is a development by the company known as NVIDIA. And I'm not disparaging NVIDIA here at all.
[02:28:11.639 --> 02:28:15.799]  The NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang, he's a brilliant man.
[02:28:15.959 --> 02:28:17.399]  He's from Taiwan, by the way.
[02:28:17.819 --> 02:28:23.219]  And he has led the way in AI infrastructure development tools.
[02:28:23.819 --> 02:28:39.020]  And one of these tools is called the Omniverse, there you go, with the universal scene description, the USD. Now, what this does for military contractors, now remember, I've been steeped in the AI space for about one year now, working with a lot of engineers,
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:43.719]  building models, doing a lot of internal development.
[02:28:44.399 --> 02:28:50.889]  And the things that I've seen with my own eyes, Alex, in the last 30 days, Are so mind-blowing.
[02:28:51.170 --> 02:28:55.870]  I have seen what would take a thousand human hours of research and writing time.
[02:28:56.049 --> 02:28:58.190]  I have seen that compressed to five minutes.
[02:28:58.670 --> 02:29:05.889]  I've done it myself on my own computer with open source models, off the shelf hardware from NVIDIA. The world has no idea what's coming.
[02:29:06.770 --> 02:29:23.510]  In the Earth simulator that NVIDIA has built, which is called the Omniverse, they have built a time accelerated robotic physics simulation engine, a digital Earth, where companies that are building autonomous systems- And say that again,
[02:29:23.569 --> 02:29:25.110]  we're gonna pull it up for people, say it again.
[02:29:25.719 --> 02:29:28.219]  Okay, it's a digital Earth.
[02:29:28.459 --> 02:29:32.639]  It is a physics simulator for autonomous systems.
[02:29:32.979 --> 02:29:35.639]  And yeah, there it is, the NVIDIA Omniverse.
[02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:37.579]  And this is a tool set.
[02:29:37.719 --> 02:29:41.159]  Again, I'm not disparaging NVIDIA. They're providing tools.
[02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:42.120]  They're providing a hammer.
[02:29:42.260 --> 02:29:44.559]  It's up to users to decide how to use it.
[02:29:44.659 --> 02:29:45.739]  But just say what it is.
[02:29:45.879 --> 02:29:47.219]  It's gonna be able to predict the future.
[02:29:48.020 --> 02:29:50.079]  No, it's a training ground.
[02:29:50.219 --> 02:29:50.920]  It's a hologram.
[02:29:51.079 --> 02:29:53.280]  It's a giant robot model of the Earth.
[02:29:54.239 --> 02:30:12.680]  Yes, yes, and then companies that are building robotic systems like Skynet Terminators, they can then sort of upload their robots into this physical simulator and let the robots try out hundreds of years of different code permutations and algorithms and different movement.
[02:30:13.149 --> 02:30:22.149]  In order to learn and evolve the correct behavior models that will achieve the goals for the robots inside the simulated Earth.
[02:30:22.350 --> 02:30:26.870]  That's what I'm saying is they can war game to then war game and predict what they do in a battle in the future is what I'm going to say.
[02:30:27.270 --> 02:30:27.690]  100%.
[02:30:27.690 --> 02:30:28.770]  Yeah, you're exactly right.
[02:30:29.079 --> 02:30:34.399]  And then, but all of this can happen in minutes instead of taking years, decades, or centuries.
[02:30:34.659 --> 02:30:35.719]  It can happen in minutes.
[02:30:35.920 --> 02:30:40.280]  And so then that final solution, like you give it a question.
[02:30:40.420 --> 02:30:43.840]  Hey, robot, how would you climb that wall and attack that bunker?
[02:30:44.270 --> 02:30:46.469]  And throw grenades and kill those enemy troops over there.
[02:30:46.530 --> 02:30:47.110]  How would you do that?
[02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:51.850]  And it goes down into the simulator, runs a bunch of NVIDIA GPUs internally.
[02:30:52.129 --> 02:30:57.690]  60 seconds later, it's mastered 100 years of trial and error to build a behavior model.
[02:30:57.829 --> 02:31:07.190]  This behavior model then gets pushed into the active memory of the humanoid robot in our world, and then that robot instantly knows how to attack a bunker.
[02:31:07.440 --> 02:31:19.940]  It instantly knows how to fly a helicopter, instantly knows how to cook a meal, fold laundry, stock a warehouse, do fulfillment for Amazon, drive a truck, drive a tank, anything.
[02:31:20.200 --> 02:31:28.200]  Or speak in your mother's voice or your father's voice that's long dead and totally mimic them, or simulate sex with you so you don't need other humans.
[02:31:29.139 --> 02:31:36.450]  Well, yeah, I'm sure that aspect is coming, but the number one thing that What these companies want to do right now, it's military.
[02:31:36.709 --> 02:31:38.370]  It's all about military.
[02:31:38.930 --> 02:31:51.770]  They, you know, again, those drone swarm demonstrations, that's about having weapons systems so that, I mean, you know, you think about what's happening in the Middle East right now with, you know, Israel and the IDF, they don't want to lose soldiers.
[02:31:51.969 --> 02:31:53.809]  So what they want, autonomous systems.
[02:31:54.170 --> 02:32:00.270]  To replace the humans so that they're not attreating human beings because they don't have that many people compared to the other countries, right?
[02:32:00.549 --> 02:32:03.909]  But everywhere in the world, Russia, Ukraine, China, US, Mexico.
[02:32:03.909 --> 02:32:04.690]  It's all drone war.
[02:32:04.909 --> 02:32:05.909]  It's already accelerating.
[02:32:06.110 --> 02:32:08.229]  That's how they knocked out Syria so fast was drones.
[02:32:09.170 --> 02:32:10.229]  A hundred percent.
[02:32:10.510 --> 02:32:24.129]  But what I'm saying is that first, we're going to see human armies transition into humanoid robotic and dog robot armies that are trained on this digital world simulator, which has a physics engine in it.
[02:32:24.229 --> 02:32:29.250]  It simulates gravity, it simulates friction, mass, momentum, air, everything.
[02:32:29.530 --> 02:32:32.270]  It's like a matrix for robot training, okay?
[02:32:32.530 --> 02:32:38.459]  And No longer does a programmer have to specifically code the movements of a robot.
[02:32:38.639 --> 02:32:43.020]  No, you just give the missions and then it war games every possible scenario and finds the best.
[02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:45.659]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:32:45.920 --> 02:32:53.120]  And just like generative text models right now or generative video models can produce a movie now, and they can reproduce you.
[02:32:53.239 --> 02:32:58.260]  They can produce an Alex Jones broadcast that's pretty similar to your likeness.
[02:32:58.379 --> 02:33:05.200]  Well, they're going to be able to produce behavior models now with these physical robots that can manipulate things in the physical world.
[02:33:05.340 --> 02:33:06.940]  And then, Alex, where this goes next?
[02:33:07.280 --> 02:33:10.920]  After they prove these robots on the battlefield, they're coming for us.
[02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:12.139]  We're next.
[02:33:12.360 --> 02:33:22.040]  And by the way, Eric Schmidt, who's running all this with the Pentagon, who says we should ban free speech and use the military against anti-vaxxers, said that at Stanford three months ago.
[02:33:22.479 --> 02:33:24.260]  He says this is the entire future.
[02:33:24.459 --> 02:33:25.200]  Humans are gone.
[02:33:25.340 --> 02:33:31.739]  And meanwhile, they're sabotaging the human systems, poisoning us, castrating our sons, cutting off the food.
[02:33:31.899 --> 02:33:35.340]  John Kerry said this year, we got to cut off half the farming or people will starve.
[02:33:35.780 --> 02:33:36.860]  He actually said that.
[02:33:36.959 --> 02:33:37.639]  I mean, this is it.
[02:33:38.860 --> 02:33:39.360]  Well, right.
[02:33:39.559 --> 02:33:43.340]  And agriculture will at first be taken over by the robots, right?
[02:33:43.500 --> 02:33:47.760]  Because they'll have opposable thumbs and they can go in and pick strawberries and things.
[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:53.760]  So as soon as that happens, then at some point there will be centralized control over the robot systems.
[02:33:53.879 --> 02:33:56.260]  It'll be classified, it'll be Pentagon controlled, whatever.
[02:33:56.479 --> 02:33:58.340]  And then they can just turn off farms.
[02:33:58.479 --> 02:33:59.440]  They can just turn them off.
[02:33:59.540 --> 02:34:05.180]  What they can do is they can sweep in just like the USDA says, let's test milk for bird flu, which is ridiculous.
[02:34:05.399 --> 02:34:05.940]  It's absurd.
[02:34:06.299 --> 02:34:10.479]  But they can say, well, we went to this farm, and we found a strawberry with bird flu.
[02:34:10.920 --> 02:34:14.780]  Shut down the farm, and all they do is they turn off all the robots, and it's done.
[02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:16.819]  You can't fight back against that.
[02:34:16.940 --> 02:34:18.000]  They just turn them all off.
[02:34:18.059 --> 02:34:19.600]  This is like the movie iRobot, right?
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:26.329]  And it sounds good, and under the ESG. BlackRock's saying we don't want any more pesticides, which sounds great.
[02:34:26.430 --> 02:34:32.149]  Now we're going to have robots with lasers that kill all the bugs and kill all of the weeds that's already rolling out.
[02:34:32.590 --> 02:34:36.389]  So again, by law, you have to replace the humans because it's for the earth.
[02:34:37.540 --> 02:34:41.940]  And so then the globalists, as you well know, they've always called us useless eaters.
[02:34:42.100 --> 02:34:47.500]  They're going to say, well, gosh, we no longer need 70, 80% of the human population.
[02:34:47.879 --> 02:34:51.680]  So that's when they're going to turn the robots against the people that already have them.
[02:34:51.819 --> 02:34:54.760]  But they have to make you obsolete first.
[02:34:54.920 --> 02:34:59.620]  That's why McDonald's and Whataburger and all are going to these things with robots where there's no humans.
[02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:01.659]  Then when there's a virus, everything's locked down.
[02:35:01.780 --> 02:35:02.840]  Robots sliver your food.
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.879]  It's all the little ads for robots with smiley faces.
[02:35:05.879 --> 02:35:07.299]  We're all being taught how great this is.
[02:35:08.159 --> 02:35:08.899]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:35:09.120 --> 02:35:14.219]  Now, what I'm describing, Alex, is a few years away, but I have a rule of thumb I want to share with you.
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:18.860]  Never invite a robot into your home that can grab a steak knife.
[02:35:19.819 --> 02:35:20.219]  Right?
[02:35:20.620 --> 02:35:25.219]  Don't have robots with opposable thumbs, seriously, because they can be taken over.
[02:35:25.379 --> 02:35:27.340]  There could even be malicious hijacking.
[02:35:27.540 --> 02:35:30.379]  And of course, they'll just blame Iran like they're doing with the drones.
[02:35:30.540 --> 02:35:36.760]  They'll say, well, Iran took over, hijacked all the robots in Texas, and all the robots killed all their own.
[02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:38.739]  And again, people think of robots as humanoid.
[02:35:39.250 --> 02:35:47.170]  But now all the appliances are spying, the smart meters, all the cars by law already have all the tracking systems.
[02:35:47.309 --> 02:35:50.049]  Most of them already have the driverless systems, and they don't just tell you.
[02:35:50.170 --> 02:35:52.530]  So we're only talking about a maximum overdrive scenario.
[02:35:53.540 --> 02:36:02.959]  Yeah, and the world we're going into is, you know, beyond the surveillance, but physical robots that can manipulate the world around you.
[02:36:03.100 --> 02:36:05.840]  They can grab a pillow and suffocate your face, okay?
[02:36:06.280 --> 02:36:07.979]  That kind of thing is what I'm talking about.
[02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:08.920]  That day is coming.
[02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:11.319]  Oh, I've said Musk idea that robots can cook your dinner.
[02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:12.200]  I want to cook my dinner.
[02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:12.620]  It's fun.
[02:36:12.819 --> 02:36:14.219]  I mean, I want to keep breathing.
[02:36:14.260 --> 02:36:15.040]  I don't need a respirator.
[02:36:15.159 --> 02:36:16.059]  It'd be easier if you had a respirator.
[02:36:16.139 --> 02:36:17.979]  Let's just get rid of your, you know, your legs.
[02:36:18.139 --> 02:36:19.879]  You know, let's just put your head in a jar.
[02:36:20.350 --> 02:36:22.969]  And so I want to think Musk is good in a lot of ways.
[02:36:23.170 --> 02:36:24.409]  Team humanity's got 11 kids.
[02:36:24.690 --> 02:36:25.729]  Surely he wants them to have a future.
[02:36:25.930 --> 02:36:27.709]  He's mad about his son being taken away and sterilized.
[02:36:28.129 --> 02:36:34.829]  But looking at, and obviously I'm not against technology itself, but this Atlantean explosion of it is very dangerous.
[02:36:34.969 --> 02:36:36.389]  What do you think his real game is?
[02:36:37.229 --> 02:36:39.270]  Well, yeah, I'm not opposed to technology either.
[02:36:39.409 --> 02:36:41.389]  I mean, I'm building AI systems right now.
[02:36:41.530 --> 02:36:46.430]  And as soon as there are perimeter patrol robot dogs available, I'm going to get one.
[02:36:46.989 --> 02:36:49.670]  And what Musk is doing is building infrastructure.
[02:36:49.930 --> 02:36:56.329]  But what will happen is Musk's technology can be taken over by a rogue government.
[02:36:56.670 --> 02:37:00.389]  Without his consent, without his permission, and that's where these things go.
[02:37:00.569 --> 02:37:15.649]  I mean, look at the construction of the first atomic bomb, and not all those scientists were on board with how that was used against civilians in Hiroshima and not- Let's be clear, the ESG BlackRock Combine, 87% of world assets says- Everything invested is anti-human to,
[02:37:15.750 --> 02:37:18.569]  quote, reduce carbon footprint to make us obsolete.
[02:37:18.790 --> 02:37:20.170]  So this plan is rolling forward.
[02:37:20.290 --> 02:37:22.190]  So never go to a robot restaurant.
[02:37:22.370 --> 02:37:25.389]  Never go to these new McDonald's and things where there's no humans.
[02:37:25.510 --> 02:37:26.329]  You go program it.
[02:37:26.549 --> 02:37:28.930]  That is literally them phasing out the human grid.
[02:37:29.129 --> 02:37:32.229]  Don't go to Michael's where there's no checkout people anymore.
[02:37:33.030 --> 02:37:34.090]  Notice you go to the grocery store.
[02:37:34.229 --> 02:37:35.750]  20 of the checkouts are self-checkout.
[02:37:35.850 --> 02:37:37.350]  They leave one open with a human.
[02:37:37.450 --> 02:37:38.450]  Everybody goes to the human one.
[02:37:38.889 --> 02:37:40.629]  Refuse to go anywhere where there aren't humans.
[02:37:40.750 --> 02:37:43.090]  We need to keep humans in the loop.
[02:37:43.890 --> 02:37:48.870]  Yeah, and don't buy a robot that you can't beat in a fight.
[02:37:49.790 --> 02:37:51.729]  Don't buy robots with opposable thumbs.
[02:37:51.790 --> 02:37:52.309]  This is what I'm saying.
[02:37:52.610 --> 02:38:00.069]  Like a dog robot that's just got blunt paws and a mouth that doesn't work, but it's a patrol robot.
[02:38:00.069 --> 02:38:02.809]  I can see that being very useful in a lot of situations.
[02:38:03.309 --> 02:38:03.770]  Exactly.
[02:38:03.989 --> 02:38:06.590]  Humans control technology and purpose it for us.
[02:38:07.069 --> 02:38:12.690]  Always, though, don't turn your back on it and always understand it can be hijacked by the bad guys any moment.
[02:38:13.889 --> 02:38:18.629]  And this is why I believe surviving humans are going to become experts in killing robots.
[02:38:18.809 --> 02:38:20.149]  And I'm not joking about that.
[02:38:20.350 --> 02:38:28.809]  And the good news is that most of these robots will have lithium-ion batteries, which are highly flammable when they are ventilated with AR-15 rounds.
[02:38:29.469 --> 02:38:34.469]  And the battery capacity currently doesn't allow humanoid robots to carry a lot of armor.
[02:38:34.610 --> 02:38:36.010]  It's just too heavy, too cumbersome.
[02:38:36.149 --> 02:38:39.549]  So if you own a robot, you should also own an AR-15.
[02:38:40.100 --> 02:38:42.139]  You should be able to kill that robot.
[02:38:42.540 --> 02:38:44.260]  Otherwise, you have no business having one.
[02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:47.219]  And that's going to be the next thing is laws to protect robots.
[02:38:48.379 --> 02:38:50.219]  Yeah, well, good luck with that.
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:51.780]  A robot turns on me.
[02:38:51.879 --> 02:38:53.180]  I'm going to blast it.
[02:38:54.340 --> 02:38:56.559]  I mean, I'm not going to even have one near me like that.
[02:38:56.659 --> 02:38:59.280]  But other people will have robots.
[02:38:59.399 --> 02:39:03.639]  And these robots, when they turn against humans, they can kill everybody in the current household.
[02:39:03.639 --> 02:39:05.979]  And then they can just go to the next door in the neighborhood.
[02:39:06.100 --> 02:39:07.020]  Kill everybody in that house.
[02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:07.719]  Go to the next door.
[02:39:07.799 --> 02:39:13.139]  We're talking about And again, the government can just say, well, Iran did it.
[02:39:13.219 --> 02:39:13.819]  It was hacked.
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.020]  Well, that's what I wanted to say.
[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:18.440]  We see the longshoremen complaining of being replaced by robot trucks and everything.
[02:39:18.639 --> 02:39:23.100]  I'm not against innovation, but it's all being deployed by globalists to make us obsolete.
[02:39:23.299 --> 02:39:23.940]  I think...
[02:39:24.829 --> 02:39:30.469]  Brands and companies should say we're all human, made by humans, and then we can choose to buy from the human infrastructure.
[02:39:30.790 --> 02:39:32.629]  I think we really need to start doing that now.
[02:39:32.750 --> 02:39:45.770]  And we should really keep the super high technology on reservations and have a real racism towards robots, a prejudice against them to absolutely keep them controlled.
[02:39:46.819 --> 02:39:49.700]  Well, as long as the robot is white, you can discriminate against it.
[02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:52.659]  So good thing that's what Elon Musk is putting out.
[02:39:53.500 --> 02:39:55.159]  Any other color, you're out of luck.
[02:39:55.420 --> 02:39:56.540]  You'll be charged with a crime.
[02:39:57.379 --> 02:39:59.479]  Well, they panned it up rainbow for sure.
[02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:01.290]  Yeah, right.
[02:40:01.489 --> 02:40:03.870]  You can have your LGBT robot.
[02:40:04.729 --> 02:40:11.530]  The point is that we have to use some technology, but selectively and with ethics and morality.
[02:40:11.889 --> 02:40:16.329]  And that is what's lacking in our society, it's lacking in our government, it's lacking in corporations.
[02:40:16.569 --> 02:40:20.090]  They're all driven by greed and profits, especially the military industrial complex.
[02:40:20.549 --> 02:40:23.389]  And globally, there's an effort now to exterminate human beings.
[02:40:23.569 --> 02:40:25.969]  But here's my official prediction on your show.
[02:40:26.479 --> 02:40:45.239]  Is that beginning in 2025, the veil will be dropped, the matrix shell will collapse for many people, and the globalists will overtly begin talking about and acting on a desire to thin the human population by whatever means is necessary.
[02:40:45.559 --> 02:40:48.000]  And they'll probably declare a climate emergency to justify it.
[02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:48.719]  So that's coming.
[02:40:50.090 --> 02:40:51.030]  Oh, I totally agree.
[02:40:51.190 --> 02:40:57.450]  And they have to artificially cut off resources and then tell people, hey, if we don't take care of grandma, we can hire 10 teachers, the famous Bill Gates quote.
[02:40:57.649 --> 02:41:06.549]  This is create artificially lowered energy and resources and then get the managerial class and others to get on board.
[02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:08.930]  That's really what the leftist cult's always been.
[02:41:09.049 --> 02:41:12.110]  They're just going to externalize the hierarchy of their eugenics operation.
[02:41:12.930 --> 02:41:14.469]  Yes, that's 100%.
[02:41:14.469 --> 02:41:18.790]  But Alex, I have to tell you something else about this too, that's really important to understand.
[02:41:19.430 --> 02:41:25.489]  The ability to run these physics simulations, this is now available at a prosumer level.
[02:41:25.690 --> 02:41:32.190]  This doesn't require centralized control of massive server banks run by trillion dollar corporations.
[02:41:32.450 --> 02:41:38.270]  This can be accessed by countries like North Korea, countries like Iran.
[02:41:38.579 --> 02:41:48.739]  Or even small terror cells in certain areas, wherever they happen to be or whatever their mission is- And that's what guarantees this is going to keep accelerating is because the arms race.
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:51.319]  This is absolutely an arms race.
[02:41:51.760 --> 02:41:55.659]  And this cannot be controlled.
[02:41:55.799 --> 02:41:58.360]  The spread of technology cannot be controlled.
[02:41:58.459 --> 02:42:10.250]  This is why the internet itself We escaped control of the censors, and that's why they had to start pushing extreme censorship in 2015, and you know the rest of that story, attacking you and me and everybody else.
[02:42:10.250 --> 02:42:13.030]  So it's from Indian fire, and it needs to be decentralized.
[02:42:13.290 --> 02:42:22.149]  Again, the answer to all of this is we aren't afraid of it, but we do respect it and are concerned about it, and we become experts in it, which is what the globalists don't want.
[02:42:22.250 --> 02:42:26.729]  They want only approved AI that's come out that no one else has.
[02:42:26.729 --> 02:42:28.049]  They only want approved robots.
[02:42:28.549 --> 02:42:35.790]  But the answer is, you know, the best advancements in using these big AI systems has been the small shops and individuals who actually innovate and learn it.
[02:42:35.850 --> 02:42:40.149]  The system's actually afraid of it, and the big corporations are having big trouble figuring out how they want to deploy it.
[02:42:41.279 --> 02:42:42.959]  Yes, exactly right.
[02:42:43.100 --> 02:42:52.379]  And we need to be extremely cautious, but there will be uses of this technology for personal defense, for your own personal security or neighborhood security or corporate security.
[02:42:52.600 --> 02:43:02.739]  You might have an open-source friendly robot dog in the InfoWars studios one day to help alert people.
[02:43:02.979 --> 02:43:11.120]  For stalkers or anybody that's threatening the studios or as what recently happened, like illegal unconstitutional shutdown orders and things like that.
[02:43:11.260 --> 02:43:11.879]  You don't know.
[02:43:12.340 --> 02:43:19.120]  But it needs to be open source, it needs to be distributed, and the future of humanity, I believe, is a decentralized future.
[02:43:19.719 --> 02:43:35.360]  And part of that, by the way, I'm aware there are going to be major lawsuits filed against the FDA after Trump is sworn in, assuming RFK Jr. gets into HHS, major lawsuits coming to challenge the FDA's free speech restrictions on nutritional supplements.
[02:43:35.559 --> 02:43:43.370]  Alex, imagine being able to talk about your own supplements and tell the truth Without being threatened by the FDA. That could become a reality.
[02:43:43.729 --> 02:43:45.370]  And those lawsuits are going to happen.
[02:43:45.530 --> 02:43:46.149]  Well, that's right.
[02:43:46.190 --> 02:43:48.149]  We need a pro-human, team-humanity revolution.
[02:43:49.069 --> 02:43:51.190]  That is the answer to all of this.
[02:43:51.350 --> 02:43:52.510]  And learn the knowledge.
[02:43:54.069 --> 02:43:54.909]  Decentralize the truth.
[02:43:55.309 --> 02:43:56.409]  That's all you and I do.
[02:43:56.469 --> 02:43:57.649]  That's why the system doesn't like us.
[02:43:57.649 --> 02:43:59.270]  We do the real research.
[02:43:59.270 --> 02:44:03.370]  We want everybody else to do the research and find out it's true and even learn more than we know.
[02:44:03.870 --> 02:44:04.729]  That's the answer.
[02:44:04.829 --> 02:44:06.729]  It's getting people smarter, not more ignorant.
[02:44:07.879 --> 02:44:13.260]  That's right, Google is a disinformation engine that has tried to isolate humanity from knowledge.
[02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:23.360]  But you and I, Alex, and all those with us, and Tucker Carlson, etc., we are all about informing people, connecting them to knowledge, also a lot of hidden knowledge, lost knowledge.
[02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:27.299]  Or it's not misinformation, it's missing information.
[02:44:27.540 --> 02:44:32.899]  And we're bringing that missing information back to people's consciousness because people have short memories.
[02:44:33.100 --> 02:44:35.620]  And that is what is going to conquer the future.
[02:44:35.899 --> 02:44:37.420]  This is the info war.
[02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:39.239]  Ultimate info war.
[02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:43.799]  And we can succeed because decentralization is winning.
[02:44:44.280 --> 02:44:46.079]  Centralized control is losing big time.
[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:48.000]  Every day centralized control is losing.
[02:44:48.399 --> 02:44:49.299]  Censorship is losing.
[02:44:49.559 --> 02:44:52.600]  They didn't take you off the air except for a few hours that one day.
[02:44:53.170 --> 02:44:54.389]  And that's it, you know?
[02:44:54.610 --> 02:44:57.049]  And they haven't been able to silence me either.
[02:44:57.290 --> 02:44:59.129]  And they're done.
[02:44:59.350 --> 02:45:01.270]  So decentralization is the future.
[02:45:01.629 --> 02:45:02.809]  Not everybody's going to survive.
[02:45:03.190 --> 02:45:05.329]  People need to be prepared for what's coming.
[02:45:05.530 --> 02:45:09.649]  It's going to rock your world, and it will fracture your psychology.
[02:45:09.870 --> 02:45:13.450]  Do five more minutes with us, and then I'm going to get a bunch of the news and other guests joining us.
[02:45:13.809 --> 02:45:15.649]  I want you, because I really respect you.
[02:45:15.690 --> 02:45:22.770]  You're one of the most smartest people I know, who's also an engineer and a scientist, but you also have a lot of general knowledge, street smarts, so I really respect that.
[02:45:23.439 --> 02:45:31.680]  When you talk about, they've artificially say it's global warming when it was a global lockdown where they threw the IMF and World Bank, told the third world countries how to produce food.
[02:45:32.180 --> 02:45:36.600]  93% in big studies and others, 97% coming in, said we don't have food.
[02:45:36.680 --> 02:45:42.100]  We're told to come here by the UN. So it wasn't COVID killed all those people starving to death and brought them here, the survivors.
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:43.159]  It was the lockdown.
[02:45:43.399 --> 02:45:45.360]  They have already pulled the rug out from the global economy.
[02:45:45.479 --> 02:45:47.819]  They've already cut global fertilizer production by 30% or more.
[02:45:48.020 --> 02:45:51.159]  So the dominoes are already falling when you say billions are going to die.
[02:45:51.399 --> 02:45:52.440]  Let's talk about it when we come back.
[02:46:00.719 --> 02:46:08.459]  I've got a very simple but important, powerful, and completely truthful proposal for you.
[02:46:09.329 --> 02:46:10.790]  Keep Info Awards on the air.
[02:46:10.950 --> 02:46:23.489]  Keep our broadcast fighting the globalists at this critical time in history and massively increase your overall health, your vibrancy, your stamina, your libido, everything.
[02:46:24.129 --> 02:46:33.250]  Ladies and gentlemen, Seamoss, Irish Seamoss specifically, is known as one of the top, if not the top, superfoods on the planet.
[02:46:33.409 --> 02:46:35.569]  It certainly gives hemp a run for its money.
[02:46:35.850 --> 02:46:38.350]  And what it does to the body is just incredible.
[02:46:38.969 --> 02:46:50.350]  Well, the CMOS we have at thealexjonesstore.com is a private label of one of the top rated strongest CMOS formulas in the country.
[02:46:50.770 --> 02:46:52.469]  So we're not reinventing the wheel here.
[02:46:52.610 --> 02:47:21.059]  We're bringing you the known top superfood from a top producer that our great sponsors at thealexjonesstore.com have gotten the authorization because the owners of the formula We're good to go.
[02:47:28.200 --> 02:47:38.059]  What some of the superfoods, because it's not just sea moss that's in it, though it is the equivalent of 40 grams concentrated sea moss in one serving, two capsules.
[02:47:38.200 --> 02:47:44.739]  It's also got the bladder rack and the burdock root, as well as concentrated pepperdine and more.
[02:47:44.979 --> 02:47:48.559]  So here's what Irish sea moss does, according to ChatGPT.
[02:47:48.760 --> 02:47:50.299]  Rich in nutrients.
[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:54.559]  Contains 92 of the 102 essential minerals the body needs.
[02:47:54.979 --> 02:47:56.520]  Boost immune system support.
[02:47:56.950 --> 02:47:59.209]  Packed with antioxidants and antiviral properties.
[02:47:59.690 --> 02:48:01.010]  Supports digestive health.
[02:48:01.270 --> 02:48:02.489]  Enhances skin health.
[02:48:02.670 --> 02:48:03.909]  Promotes thyroid function.
[02:48:04.290 --> 02:48:05.350]  Aids weight loss management.
[02:48:05.649 --> 02:48:06.829]  Improves energy levels.
[02:48:07.110 --> 02:48:08.389]  Supports respiratory health.
[02:48:08.690 --> 02:48:09.709]  That's just the sea moss.
[02:48:10.069 --> 02:48:11.190]  Now let's look at bladder rack.
[02:48:11.530 --> 02:48:12.469]  Thyroid support.
[02:48:12.750 --> 02:48:13.870]  Anti-inflammatory.
[02:48:14.190 --> 02:48:14.989]  Digestive aid.
[02:48:15.329 --> 02:48:16.069]  Rich in antioxidants.
[02:48:16.549 --> 02:48:17.350]  Skin health.
[02:48:17.629 --> 02:48:18.790]  Weight management.
[02:48:19.190 --> 02:48:19.850]  Joint support.
[02:48:20.489 --> 02:48:22.549]  Improves vision and so much more.
[02:48:22.709 --> 02:48:23.909]  Now let's look at burdock root.
[02:48:24.430 --> 02:48:37.129]  Detoxifies the body, rich in antioxidants, improves skin health, supports digestive health, boosts immune system function, balances blood sugar, anti-inflammatory, supports circulation, and again, so much more.
[02:48:37.270 --> 02:48:41.930]  And it's not just Ultimate CMOS Formula that's amazing at thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:48:42.290 --> 02:48:54.260]  Incredible Patriot gear, Infowars gear, Trump 1 gear, we have limited edition fundraiser posters, And all of these products keep our transmission on the air.
[02:48:54.440 --> 02:49:00.600]  Whether InfoWars gets shut down by the bad guys or not, looks like it's not going to be by the grace of God, so keep praying for us and keep supporting.
[02:49:01.020 --> 02:49:05.700]  But regardless, we've set up the Alex Jones Network and are ready in case it shuts down.
[02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:07.040]  To not miss a beat.

[02:49:40.860 --> 02:49:46.340]  And I want to thank you for keeping us on the air and encourage you now to support so we stay on the air in the face of the New World Order.
[02:49:52.440 --> 02:49:56.420]  All right, final segment with naturalnews.com.
[02:50:00.090 --> 02:50:14.590]  We're good to go.
[02:50:16.590 --> 02:50:18.790]  So they're artificially already pulling the rug out from under it.
[02:50:19.250 --> 02:50:23.909]  Trump represents more sane members of the human community, along with Musk.
[02:50:24.270 --> 02:50:25.930]  We need a bigger population.
[02:50:26.489 --> 02:50:30.010]  And Musk has said, you collapse everything, there'll be giant wars.
[02:50:30.010 --> 02:50:31.309]  The globalists will never survive it.
[02:50:31.329 --> 02:50:36.290]  It's just a bad model, even if you had agreed with that sinister aim from a very selfish perspective.
[02:50:36.569 --> 02:50:39.809]  So, I mean, team humanity needs to face what we're up against.
[02:50:39.950 --> 02:50:46.030]  But on current trajectories, just with these developments decentralizing regardless, what are we looking at?
[02:50:47.159 --> 02:50:51.139]  Well, we have to start with the financial side of that to understand where this is going.
[02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:58.360]  The US government is insolvent and it's unfunded entitlements and obligations to the American people.
[02:50:59.860 --> 02:51:04.120]  Federal workers who have retired, etc., is I think somewhere close to $230 trillion.
[02:51:04.420 --> 02:51:05.840]  That can never be met.
[02:51:05.979 --> 02:51:15.700]  So the only way actually for governments like the US, Canada, France, and so on, the UK, to remain solvent is through what's called tapering the population.
[02:51:15.799 --> 02:51:24.020]  They have to kill off people at a certain rate or better than that, or higher than that, in order for the governments to remain solvent.
[02:51:24.059 --> 02:51:27.600]  And they openly say this, and that's what COVID was a beta test.
[02:51:29.019 --> 02:51:29.899]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:51:30.260 --> 02:51:37.340]  And remember, the easiest way for a government to eliminate these debt obligations from its balance sheet is to kill the people who would be collecting that.
[02:51:37.739 --> 02:51:44.040]  And that's one of the reasons why elderly were encouraged to go get shots and why so many of them are now, of course, dead.
[02:51:45.249 --> 02:51:51.250]  But the tapering that they tried with the vaccines, it wasn't happening quickly enough.
[02:51:51.450 --> 02:51:57.670]  Too many people learned about ivermectin and zinc and vitamin C and whatever, and it just didn't have the kill rate that the globalists wanted.
[02:51:57.790 --> 02:52:09.610]  That's why they're going to shift into this more overt phase or try another round of a scarier pandemic with blood coming out of people's eyes and then see if that gets some more people to commit vaccine euthanasia.
[02:52:09.850 --> 02:52:16.819]  But assuming that they can even do that, At most, they could get maybe one to two billion people through that.
[02:52:17.059 --> 02:52:27.159]  They still need wars, they need famine, and they need Skynet in order to get the other 7.5 billion people that they want to exterminate.
[02:52:27.299 --> 02:52:31.399]  So they're going to use all of those things, one by one, all of those things.
[02:52:31.739 --> 02:52:46.030]  And remember that the globalists see the purpose of human beings was to serve the temporary role of having brain power and muscle power In order to get us to the robotic takeover age, the AI age.
[02:52:46.469 --> 02:52:49.750]  And that's why they officially say at the WF, the human era is over.
[02:52:49.969 --> 02:52:50.770]  The future is not human.
[02:52:50.889 --> 02:52:52.149]  That's what they say, exactly.
[02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:57.379]  And so they no longer see most humans as necessary at all.
[02:52:57.620 --> 02:53:00.059]  And you're gonna see the replacements really beginning to happen.
[02:53:00.280 --> 02:53:06.700]  This is what's kind of funny because the American people are being replaced by these illegal migrants in many cases.
[02:53:06.879 --> 02:53:08.659]  Well, the migrants are about to be replaced by robots.
[02:53:08.819 --> 02:53:10.920]  So the replacement works both ways.
[02:53:11.040 --> 02:53:12.159]  I mean, it keeps going.
[02:53:12.299 --> 02:53:14.739]  The robots will be replacing the migrant workers.
[02:53:15.079 --> 02:53:23.180]  And then the globalists only need enough humans around who understand how to build more complex robotic systems.
[02:53:23.280 --> 02:53:32.719]  And even that is only a short period because within about the next five years, the AI systems will take over all capabilities of human intelligence.
[02:53:33.329 --> 02:53:38.790]  Including, I mean, they won't replace creativity, the inspiration from the divine.
[02:53:39.010 --> 02:53:45.389]  They won't replace free will, but they will replace engineering, technology, mathematics, protein.
[02:53:45.489 --> 02:53:53.889]  And that's why we need a human union where humans buy from humans, support humans, so that we can't be made obsolete, which is the amended plan.
[02:53:54.010 --> 02:53:55.690]  We have to decentralize now.
[02:53:57.899 --> 02:54:00.959]  It's a survival strategy at this point.
[02:54:01.120 --> 02:54:04.120]  Yes, it's an existential threat against humanity.
[02:54:04.299 --> 02:54:11.840]  So look, it's gonna be a rough time, but I'm so glad that InfoWars is viable, that we are all still here.
[02:54:12.059 --> 02:54:15.899]  We are going to witness the deaths of billions of people in the years ahead.
[02:54:16.610 --> 02:54:19.250]  And they're going to try to scare us into killing ourselves off.
[02:54:19.389 --> 02:54:21.450]  But with the right information, we can resist that.
[02:54:21.610 --> 02:54:22.489]  We can empower others.
[02:54:22.610 --> 02:54:23.309]  We can stay informed.
[02:54:23.430 --> 02:54:24.069]  We can stay alive.
[02:54:24.129 --> 02:54:25.510]  We can raise healthy children.
[02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:27.209]  And we can help humanity survive.
[02:54:27.250 --> 02:54:35.329]  And we can take control of governments and systems now to reverse this anti-human project and explain to the globals like Musk has done, you'll get destroyed in this too.
[02:54:35.829 --> 02:54:37.389]  Thank you, Mike Adams, naturalnews.com.
[02:54:37.530 --> 02:54:38.370]  Incredible hour.
[02:54:38.510 --> 02:54:39.209]  One of the best ever.
[02:54:39.530 --> 02:54:40.610]  Thank you so much for my friend.
[02:54:40.790 --> 02:54:41.129]  Merry Christmas.
[02:54:41.149 --> 02:54:41.489]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:42.010]  God bless.
[02:54:42.670 --> 02:54:43.129]  We'll be right back.
[02:54:43.209 --> 02:54:43.530]  Stay with us.
[02:54:44.200 --> 02:54:46.479]  Well, we're in an incredible time of change.
[02:54:46.780 --> 02:54:49.280]  The current global power blocks know that.
[02:54:49.860 --> 02:54:55.940]  Their answers make people stupider, more unhealthy, so we don't get in the way of their battle for control.
[02:54:56.280 --> 02:55:00.639]  Well, we want to decentralize the knowledge so people actually understand what the choices are.
[02:55:00.819 --> 02:55:02.000]  We believe in free will.
[02:55:02.159 --> 02:55:03.040]  We believe in human destiny.
[02:55:03.180 --> 02:55:04.020]  We know God's real.
[02:55:04.620 --> 02:55:06.760]  So this broadcast could not be more important.
[02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:08.579]  And we would have been shut down last night.
[02:55:08.739 --> 02:55:10.819]  The Justice Department, U.S. trustee assigned to the case...
[02:55:13.409 --> 02:55:15.229]  That he was going to close us last night.
[02:55:15.309 --> 02:55:19.389]  The judge ruled that the fake sale that never happened was real.
[02:55:19.510 --> 02:55:19.969]  It wasn't.
[02:55:20.190 --> 02:55:21.969]  So I want to thank you all for your prayer.
[02:55:22.190 --> 02:55:24.049]  I want to thank you all for your support, your word of mouth.
[02:55:24.549 --> 02:55:26.629]  This is a microcosm of all of our fights.
[02:55:26.770 --> 02:55:36.649]  But to decentralize society with farming and energy and humanity is to decentralize the mind from the globalists first by knowing their operation and then thinking about alternatives to it.
[02:55:37.239 --> 02:55:39.299]  You can't just challenge a bad structure.
[02:55:39.459 --> 02:55:41.819]  You've got to also promote other ones.
[02:55:41.940 --> 02:55:43.899]  And the first thing is to know how the world works.
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:45.319]  We know how it works.
[02:55:45.459 --> 02:55:46.319]  We document everything.
[02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:48.180]  That's why they want us off the air.
[02:55:48.559 --> 02:55:51.860]  They don't want narratives countervailing what they're doing.
[02:55:52.340 --> 02:55:58.020]  So I want to hit some financial news, some other political news, big developments there in the hyper-accelerated change happening.
[02:55:59.559 --> 02:56:01.899]  But before I do that, I just want to explain something.
[02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:06.159]  We are now spending, which is fine, it's a war.
[02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:17.299]  70% of the money coming in at the AlexJonesStore.com in counter lawsuits on the offense and defense.
[02:56:17.559 --> 02:56:21.079]  You know how much it costs to depose a bunch of people in the Justice Department last week?
[02:56:22.079 --> 02:56:23.540]  To depose their operatives?
[02:56:24.120 --> 02:56:26.620]  And then to nail their ass in court in the last two days?
[02:56:27.819 --> 02:56:29.559]  It costs a lot of money, okay?
[02:56:29.700 --> 02:56:32.819]  To have real lawyers and real people and real preparation and real research.
[02:56:34.159 --> 02:56:34.899]  It's okay.
[02:56:34.899 --> 02:56:35.559]  It's a war.
[02:56:36.440 --> 02:56:38.959]  Trump was given $3 billion by the American people.
[02:56:39.100 --> 02:56:43.940]  He spent hundreds of millions just on lawyers and poll watchers and all the key battlegrounds, and we mitigated the fraud in one.
[02:56:44.500 --> 02:56:46.379]  Well, Infowars doesn't need billions.
[02:56:46.379 --> 02:56:52.700]  We need Six, seven million dollars in the next six months.
[02:56:52.979 --> 02:56:54.079]  And we add more than that.
[02:56:54.239 --> 02:56:56.280]  We will destroy these people in court.
[02:56:56.379 --> 02:56:57.659]  We have their ash.
[02:56:57.819 --> 02:57:02.500]  And I'm not going to give out all of the strategy and stuff, but we're having defectors from their side.
[02:57:02.600 --> 02:57:03.299]  It's all coming out.
[02:57:03.420 --> 02:57:04.239]  The big turning.
[02:57:04.639 --> 02:57:06.159]  Humanity senses the globalist threat.
[02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:08.020]  People know it's serious deep down.
[02:57:08.260 --> 02:57:09.100]  It's a huge exit.
[02:57:09.180 --> 02:57:09.680]  It's out of the city.
[02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:10.559]  People say, I got to get out.
[02:57:10.620 --> 02:57:10.879]  I don't know.
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:11.540]  It's not safe.
[02:57:11.860 --> 02:57:12.020]  Yeah.
[02:57:12.260 --> 02:57:13.180]  People are decentralizing.
[02:57:13.340 --> 02:57:13.739]  It's happening everywhere.
[02:57:13.979 --> 02:57:15.420]  We were 90% urban 10 years ago.
[02:57:15.500 --> 02:57:16.620]  We're like 82% now.
[02:57:16.719 --> 02:57:17.360]  People are getting it.
[02:57:18.229 --> 02:57:22.370]  And so, there's a lot happening in the collective unconscious.
[02:57:22.530 --> 02:57:22.989]  People know.
[02:57:23.190 --> 02:57:31.819]  But when you support the Infowar, You have to understand, we create the most accurate, countervailing narratives to the globalists.
[02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:32.780]  They admit that.
[02:57:32.899 --> 02:57:36.079]  They have Armed Services Committee hearings saying, I've got to be taken off the air eight years ago.
[02:57:36.219 --> 02:57:41.959]  I've been targeted by the criminals because I have all the best guests on, all the best scientists, all the best economists, all the best researchers.
[02:57:42.079 --> 02:57:43.620]  I mean, this is God's work here.
[02:57:43.700 --> 02:57:44.399]  This is you.
[02:57:44.479 --> 02:57:45.180]  This is all of us together.
[02:57:45.319 --> 02:57:45.659]  It's the crew.
[02:57:46.379 --> 02:57:53.600]  So we try to make it easy for you to support us and get things you're going to love that will empower and enrich you and make you feel great so you love it.
[02:57:54.770 --> 02:58:11.069]  And so when you go to the yellowshowstore.com and you get these incredible products like the new Ultimate Turmeric Formula, it's concentrated in the strongest turmeric out there, gummies, with concentrated ginger and black pepper extract, all of that's super anti-inflammatory, all of that's super anti-cancer,
[02:58:11.149 --> 02:58:13.670]  all of that is so good for your eyes and your heart and your lungs.
[02:58:13.809 --> 02:58:14.750]  It's amazing.
[02:58:16.299 --> 02:58:20.020]  That product's now available, discounted, out of the gates, at thealexonestore.com.
[02:58:20.299 --> 02:58:26.520]  And the Sambucus concentrated antiviral, antibacterial, immune-boosting gummies as well.
[02:58:26.639 --> 02:58:29.520]  And then fun stuff like Trump on the Stump Elf.
[02:58:33.280 --> 02:58:39.000]  We're good to go.
[02:58:47.110 --> 02:58:54.129]  Hoodies and Christmas sweaters and limited edition stuff at the AlexJonesStore.com.
[02:58:54.350 --> 02:58:56.530]  And it takes money to win wars.
[02:58:56.909 --> 02:58:59.389]  And so the funds are coming in to keep InfoWars in the year.
[02:58:59.489 --> 02:59:04.870]  If they end up getting that, which it's not looking like now, but that takes funds to battle to get that final victory.
[02:59:05.090 --> 02:59:06.610]  How much we've come three times.
[02:59:07.530 --> 02:59:14.069]  In the last seven months, the Justice Department intervening in the bankruptcy has tried to shut us down without a court order.
[02:59:14.270 --> 02:59:16.290]  But I had to fight like hell.
[02:59:16.510 --> 02:59:18.030]  They just thought we'd roll over.
[02:59:18.750 --> 02:59:21.989]  So, thank you for keeping me on air.
[02:59:22.129 --> 02:59:22.690]  It's you.
[02:59:22.829 --> 02:59:23.610]  This is your fight.
[02:59:23.709 --> 02:59:24.489]  This is a tug-of-war.
[02:59:25.270 --> 02:59:26.569]  And I'm working harder than ever.
[02:59:26.649 --> 02:59:29.430]  You see that because I know we're entering the fourth turning.
[02:59:30.250 --> 02:59:31.770]  So, theallowshownstore.com.
[02:59:32.030 --> 02:59:34.729]  Become a VIP for $30 a month, canceling time month to month.
[02:59:34.809 --> 02:59:36.110]  Get $40 to spend on the store each month.
[02:59:36.209 --> 02:59:38.629]  And when you remember, you get special discount codes, free gifts.
[02:59:38.729 --> 02:59:39.229]  It's insane.
[02:59:40.319 --> 02:59:43.760]  And one lucky winner gets an incredible off-road truck every month.
[02:59:44.180 --> 02:59:46.739]  You get entered to win every time you buy something a whole bunch of times.
[02:59:46.940 --> 02:59:47.700]  You can do it for free.
[02:59:47.739 --> 02:59:49.819]  Just put your email in and you get entered to win as well.
[02:59:50.319 --> 02:59:52.239]  I mean, there's a lot of exciting things.
[02:59:52.280 --> 02:59:53.680]  We'll make it fun to fight tyranny.
[02:59:53.760 --> 02:59:55.200]  But we have to build our own economy.
[02:59:55.299 --> 02:59:58.000]  You've got to fund the patriots and shop with the good guys.
[02:59:58.280 --> 03:00:01.120]  When you shop with the globalists, and we all do it because it's hard.
[03:00:01.319 --> 03:00:02.379]  They've got so much stuff out there.
[03:00:02.760 --> 03:00:05.059]  But I go to mom and pops almost always.
[03:00:05.059 --> 03:00:07.260]  I try to go to the, you know, thrift stores.
[03:00:07.440 --> 03:00:08.719]  I try to support the Patriots.
[03:00:08.799 --> 03:00:10.899]  I try to look at what the companies stand for.
[03:00:10.959 --> 03:00:15.559]  And if I even have to pay more somewhere else for a service, but it's a good service, I'll do it because it's decentralized.
[03:00:16.719 --> 03:00:18.120]  So this is economic warfare.
[03:00:18.280 --> 03:00:19.399]  This is psychological warfare.
[03:00:19.559 --> 03:00:20.559]  This is information warfare.
[03:00:21.079 --> 03:00:25.920]  And your support, getting great products that enrich your life, doesn't just support you.
[03:00:25.920 --> 03:00:27.440]  It supports everything we're doing.
[03:00:27.579 --> 03:00:30.620]  We're reaching over 10 million new people today, conservatively.
[03:00:30.959 --> 03:00:33.120]  The globalists are apoplectic.
[03:00:33.120 --> 03:00:33.979]  So thank you.
[03:00:34.159 --> 03:00:35.180]  And thank God.
[03:00:35.340 --> 03:00:36.899]  And thank you for all of your prayers.
[03:00:37.959 --> 03:00:39.440]  Thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:00:39.520 --> 03:00:44.959]  Do your Christmas shopping there and give yourself the gift of credible products, health, and fighting tyrants.
[03:00:45.020 --> 03:00:45.879]  It's a 360 win.
[03:00:46.739 --> 03:00:47.760]  But it's all in your hands.
[03:00:47.920 --> 03:00:48.379]  Thank you.
[03:00:48.920 --> 03:00:49.799]  TheAlexJonesTore.com.
[03:00:50.079 --> 03:00:50.299]  All right.
[03:00:51.239 --> 03:00:52.879]  Dr. Kirk Elliott is taking over.
[03:00:53.059 --> 03:00:54.819]  Then Owen in about 44 minutes.
[03:00:55.079 --> 03:00:57.139]  And I'll be back with special reports and more today.
[03:00:57.139 --> 03:00:58.280]  We're still here.
[03:00:58.280 --> 03:00:59.180]  Thanks to you.
[03:00:59.559 --> 03:01:00.500]  Let that sink in.
[03:01:00.940 --> 03:01:01.959]  Look at these headlines.
[03:01:02.399 --> 03:01:06.659]  And there's been big breaks developments, huge developments, big stuff going on around the world.
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:07.620]  This affects everybody.
[03:01:08.829 --> 03:01:10.270]  All we got left basically is the dollar.
[03:01:10.450 --> 03:01:11.750]  Trump's trying to get the industry turned back on.
[03:01:11.930 --> 03:01:13.969]  U.S. economy, Trump is inheriting as a nightmare.
[03:01:14.250 --> 03:01:17.829]  And now the media is already trying to blame it on the Trump slump, as we predicted.
[03:01:18.750 --> 03:01:21.329]  There is also a precious metal update.
[03:01:21.770 --> 03:01:22.709]  Gold price.
[03:01:23.649 --> 03:01:27.530]  Goldman Sachs predicts $3,000 by the end of next year.
[03:01:27.809 --> 03:01:29.510]  Gold prices get at $3,000.
[03:01:30.049 --> 03:01:30.629]  Gold price.
[03:01:30.809 --> 03:01:31.389]  Silver's up.
[03:01:31.530 --> 03:01:31.989]  All of it.
[03:01:32.129 --> 03:01:33.309]  A lot of big developments.
[03:01:33.530 --> 03:01:35.290]  Also, FBI Director Wray preparing to resign.
[03:01:36.350 --> 03:01:40.030]  That is being announced right now and so much more.
[03:01:40.590 --> 03:01:49.850]  All right, Dr. Kirk Elliott, who's a huge sponsor but also a great economist with one of the most accurate records predicting things and also a theologian, great friend of mine, takes over.
[03:01:49.950 --> 03:01:51.149]  He's also a fabulous sponsor.
[03:01:51.209 --> 03:01:54.729]  If you're going to get gold and silver, they have the highest ratings of the biggest silver company in North America.
[03:01:54.989 --> 03:01:58.670]  They'd be the biggest gold, but they're not pushing that because silver's got the biggest move in it.
[03:01:58.829 --> 03:01:59.790]  But gold's still great.
[03:01:59.790 --> 03:02:03.309]  If you want it, you call him and you get it for wholesale.
[03:02:03.790 --> 03:02:04.149]  They...
[03:02:07.270 --> 03:02:14.190]  We're good to go.
[03:02:22.069 --> 03:02:27.309]  I knew this guy was 20 plus years ago, and I love him to death, and he's a brother of mine in Christ.
[03:02:27.649 --> 03:02:34.909]  So you need to go right now, if you're going to get gold and silver, one of the smartest moves you can make at kepm.com forward slash gold, kepm.com forward slash gold.
[03:02:35.110 --> 03:02:41.790]  Put your email in, they'll call you back, get a free consultation, 720. You can also call 720-605-3900.
[03:02:43.450 --> 03:02:44.969]  720-605-30000.
[03:02:44.969 --> 03:02:49.889]  If you'd bought gold and silver a year ago, well, you'd be up on silver, like 50% gold massively.
[03:02:50.450 --> 03:02:51.690]  Nothing performs like this.
[03:02:51.950 --> 03:02:54.149]  720-605-30000.
[03:02:54.250 --> 03:02:55.690]  I'm all for Bitcoin, too.
[03:02:55.750 --> 03:03:00.030]  It's great to be in multiple things, but people are trying to claim it's two competing things.
[03:03:00.129 --> 03:03:02.110]  No, it's two things that augment each other and complement.
[03:03:02.549 --> 03:03:04.809]  720-605-30000.
[03:03:04.930 --> 03:03:05.450]  Make the call.
[03:03:05.690 --> 03:03:07.530]  Dr. Elliott, you are in command now.
[03:03:09.450 --> 03:03:10.190]  Great, Alex.
[03:03:10.370 --> 03:03:11.750]  It's so great to be back.
[03:03:11.969 --> 03:03:18.069]  And oh my goodness, there is big, big things happening in the precious metals markets.
[03:03:18.069 --> 03:03:23.629]  And you know what they all kind of boil down to is Trump tariffs right now.
[03:03:23.809 --> 03:03:29.670]  Literally, this is what's causing the explosion in metals.
[03:03:29.909 --> 03:03:32.270]  So when you look at...
[03:03:33.059 --> 03:03:37.760]  The nature of the people that call our office every single day.
[03:03:38.420 --> 03:03:39.239]  You know what?
[03:03:39.299 --> 03:03:39.979]  They're scared.
[03:03:40.260 --> 03:03:41.659]  They truly are, Alex.
[03:03:41.799 --> 03:03:42.459]  They're scared.
[03:03:42.639 --> 03:03:52.139]  But I was reading some scripture earlier today and go back way old school, Old Testament prophecy in Isaiah 9-6.
[03:03:52.340 --> 03:03:54.760]  It talks about Jesus being born, right?
[03:03:54.799 --> 03:03:56.100]  It's Christmas season.
[03:03:56.100 --> 03:03:58.879]  And what does the prophecy from Isaiah say?
[03:03:58.979 --> 03:04:06.420]  It says, To us a son is given, and the government shall be on his shoulders, right?
[03:04:06.600 --> 03:04:16.540]  So here's where we have this faith and this confidence moving forward that just like what we've seen with Infowars and what's happening in the legal battle, an answer to prayer.
[03:04:17.190 --> 03:04:34.670]  So here's where...
[03:04:35.500 --> 03:04:46.379]  Trump, being elected, comes into power again on January 20th, is already making dramatic global changes to the economy, right?
[03:04:46.520 --> 03:04:58.559]  And so you look at the tariffs, and so what I wanna talk about First of all, is about a week and a half ago, Trump met with Xi, president of China.
[03:04:58.840 --> 03:05:00.440]  Well, what did he tell him?
[03:05:00.540 --> 03:05:03.680]  He said, we're gonna have 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, right?
[03:05:03.879 --> 03:05:08.059]  So here's where, I don't know if it's gonna be 100%.
[03:05:08.059 --> 03:05:10.819]  My guess is it's gonna be more like 60%.
[03:05:10.819 --> 03:05:16.780]  It's a lot of political movements to actually get 100%.
[03:05:16.780 --> 03:05:17.399]  But you know what?
[03:05:17.579 --> 03:05:22.590]  With Trump, Maybe it's gonna be 150 or 200% tariffs, right?
[03:05:22.690 --> 03:05:35.930]  Because he is a bulldog and he's going to get his way to make America great again, which is why the globalists and the banking sector are actually really scared about what he's going to do.
[03:05:36.030 --> 03:05:41.069]  Because when America becomes great again, the rest of the world actually will suffer some, right?
[03:05:41.170 --> 03:05:45.969]  When tariffs are imposed on other countries' goods, it's gonna make them way more expensive.
[03:05:46.190 --> 03:05:47.590]  But it's gonna work, right?
[03:05:47.709 --> 03:05:49.540]  So anyways, He met with Xi.
[03:05:50.200 --> 03:05:51.020]  Talked to him.
[03:05:52.379 --> 03:05:56.040]  And he's gonna slap tariffs on Chinese goods.
[03:05:56.219 --> 03:05:57.280]  He said 100%.
[03:05:57.280 --> 03:05:58.920]  Let's say it's 60 to 100%.
[03:05:58.920 --> 03:06:00.000]  The number doesn't matter.
[03:06:00.120 --> 03:06:00.680]  It's gonna be big.
[03:06:01.399 --> 03:06:07.319]  10% tariffs on Mexico, which are already having an impact, right?
[03:06:07.440 --> 03:06:11.299]  Because when you put tariffs on Mexican goods in exchange for what?
[03:06:11.909 --> 03:06:18.850]  Why do you want to put tariffs on other countries' products to get them to comply with policy on our end?
[03:06:18.950 --> 03:06:20.069]  Well, what's the policy?
[03:06:20.309 --> 03:06:22.829]  We don't want fentanyl coming in across the border.
[03:06:22.930 --> 03:06:24.049]  We don't want illegal drugs.
[03:06:24.209 --> 03:06:25.430]  We don't want human trafficking.
[03:06:26.290 --> 03:06:32.690]  And we want to have you help us remove the illegal aliens that are here.
[03:06:32.889 --> 03:06:33.770]  Get them back.
[03:06:33.950 --> 03:06:35.129]  Close down that border, right?
[03:06:35.329 --> 03:06:38.370]  So the president of Mexico, she said, all right.
[03:06:39.110 --> 03:06:40.670]  Just don't slap tariffs on us, right?
[03:06:40.750 --> 03:06:41.950]  This is our economy.
[03:06:42.610 --> 03:06:43.989]  We don't want that.
[03:06:44.190 --> 03:06:47.309]  So we're gonna get help along the border.
[03:06:47.430 --> 03:06:51.829]  Now, here's where the tariffs for China become a big, massive thing, right?
[03:06:51.909 --> 03:06:53.290]  Just absolutely massive.
[03:06:53.690 --> 03:06:59.110]  Because the BRICS nations are, which China is the C in BRICS, right?
[03:06:59.329 --> 03:07:00.590]  R is Russia.
[03:07:00.809 --> 03:07:08.229]  And then you've got India, you've got South Africa, and you've got now 13 more countries that are basically waiting in the wings.
[03:07:09.370 --> 03:07:13.030]  For this upcoming BRICS session, right?
[03:07:13.190 --> 03:07:16.569]  They've already petitioned for membership, then they're gonna be voted on, right?
[03:07:16.729 --> 03:07:32.350]  So when you think about this and how does this apply to the gold and silver markets, it's like Alex and InfoWarriors out there, biggest news to hit the gold and silver market possibly ever, literally possibly ever.
[03:07:32.889 --> 03:07:41.299]  So when you look at the price of gold and silver, There's futures contracts, right?
[03:07:41.459 --> 03:07:52.420]  And what we've talked about numerous times over the last year is that Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, manipulating the silver market for decades, right?
[03:07:52.420 --> 03:07:56.739]  And so when you issue short positions, it causes the price to come down.
[03:07:56.860 --> 03:07:58.760]  That's how they've been manipulating it, right?
[03:07:58.920 --> 03:08:05.739]  So what happens when they have all these short positions outstanding and the price goes up?
[03:08:06.450 --> 03:08:08.469]  They lose money hand over fist.
[03:08:08.969 --> 03:08:15.309]  See, and I think this is part of the BRICS nation's plan to de-dollarize the world, right?
[03:08:15.389 --> 03:08:27.510]  It's like, okay, if we can attack the banks of America, right, we're gonna create crisis and havoc, and people aren't gonna have peace or confidence in the financial system, and this is part of their war, right?
[03:08:27.690 --> 03:08:31.069]  So here's where I do think that Trump is going to win this game.
[03:08:31.920 --> 03:08:43.680]  Right, but here's where I think it becomes extremely difficult for them to win because we actually have a strong leader, right?
[03:08:43.819 --> 03:08:52.040]  It takes somebody with thick skin to deal with the political aftermath of having financial considerations put on those BRICS nations, right?
[03:08:52.959 --> 03:08:58.319]  So when you look at the gold and silver market, you look at the futures price.
[03:08:58.459 --> 03:09:05.379]  And as we record this, the futures prices on silver and gold are insane.
[03:09:05.540 --> 03:09:10.459]  For example, silver today is in the low 32s.
[03:09:10.500 --> 03:09:13.299]  Call it $32.10 an ounce.
[03:09:13.899 --> 03:09:17.659]  The futures price is pushing $33 an ounce.
[03:09:17.819 --> 03:09:23.079]  So moving into the future, the futures price tells us they expect this price of silver to go up, right?
[03:09:23.319 --> 03:09:36.860]  So when you look at the contracts that are coming due in silver, March of 2025 is the next contract date, and gold is February of 2025. What happens before then?
[03:09:38.069 --> 03:09:40.590]  Trump gets in on January 20th.
[03:09:40.729 --> 03:09:51.329]  And if he's successful in implementing his tariffs, which the world financial markets are telling us, they think he is going to be successful in implementing these tariffs.
[03:09:51.569 --> 03:09:53.569]  That's why you see the futures price going up.
[03:09:53.690 --> 03:10:04.440]  So if you are the holder of a short contract, How do you get rid of those, right?
[03:10:04.540 --> 03:10:08.219]  Because the banks are gonna want to get rid of them, right?
[03:10:08.340 --> 03:10:19.959]  Because if the price goes up, and estimates are right now that these big monster banks, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, lose about $600 million every time silver goes up a dollar.
[03:10:20.659 --> 03:10:21.319]  Guess what?
[03:10:21.540 --> 03:10:24.680]  Silver went up about a dollar in the last three days, right?
[03:10:24.879 --> 03:10:26.200]  So they're losing a lot of money.
[03:10:26.399 --> 03:10:32.639]  So what happens when tariffs are put on gold and silver?
[03:10:33.020 --> 03:10:43.760]  Because when you look at the COMEX deliverable gold and silver, COMEX is the global depository, the global exchange where all those are coming from.
[03:10:45.909 --> 03:10:51.450]  There's only certain types of hallmarks or certain refineries and mintages that they allow.
[03:10:51.930 --> 03:10:59.750]  So globally, there's 140 approved COMEX refineries with the hallmarks.
[03:11:00.090 --> 03:11:06.909]  Guess how many of them are coming from countries that are gonna have tariffs slapped on them?
[03:11:08.010 --> 03:11:17.549]  45 of the 140 COMEX deliverable refineries that go to COMEX are coming from countries that are gonna have tariffs slapped on them.
[03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:21.270]  So let's just say it's a 60% tariff, not even 100%.
[03:11:21.270 --> 03:11:28.969]  If it's 100% and those metals are coming in from those countries, that doubles the price of the metal.
[03:11:29.409 --> 03:11:40.159]  So if silver's $32, well then the cost of physically owning it's gonna be 64. If it's 60%, you just add whatever the tariff is onto the price.
[03:11:40.639 --> 03:11:51.920]  So if they lose hundreds of millions of dollars every time silver goes up a dollar, they are gonna want to get out and cancel those contracts.
[03:11:52.100 --> 03:11:54.219]  Now, they've gotta get out or else they're gonna go out of business.
[03:11:55.599 --> 03:11:58.979]  But Trump's tariff policies are going to be impacted.
[03:11:59.200 --> 03:12:05.020]  So now, what we're seeing in the silver market is absolutely extraordinary, in my opinion.
[03:12:05.159 --> 03:12:21.559]  Because when you look at physical delivery, like 1,000-ounce bars, which is what manufacturers need for silver, most individual investors aren't buying 1,000-ounce bars unless you have a really, really large account and you don't want to take delivery of it and you store it.
[03:12:22.990 --> 03:12:30.309]  Well, the mint companies that are melting things down to make coins or bars or whatever, they're using 1,000-ounce bars.
[03:12:30.729 --> 03:12:35.629]  Samsung, LG, Sony, they're using 1,000-ounce bars because that's the cheapest form to buy silver.
[03:12:35.790 --> 03:12:38.629]  That's the manufacturing industrial size.
[03:12:39.209 --> 03:12:45.909]  So as of this morning, you look at the premiums, the cost of buying and selling.
[03:12:46.629 --> 03:12:51.209]  I would say a two or three cent adjustment in the price is big.
[03:12:51.530 --> 03:13:02.350]  They're up 25 cents just this morning because they're seeing that silver is going to run out and these banks are basically afraid.
[03:13:02.549 --> 03:13:08.969]  They're afraid that these tariffs are gonna slap huge massive price increases on these things.
[03:13:09.170 --> 03:13:13.889]  And so we're starting to see massive supply and demand discrepancies.
[03:13:14.479 --> 03:13:19.180]  Because there's a lot of physical silver leaving the depositories.
[03:13:19.340 --> 03:13:20.420]  And where are they going?
[03:13:21.120 --> 03:13:29.700]  When you look at COMEX on the website and you can see the available inventories that are available, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down.
[03:13:29.860 --> 03:13:30.840]  Where are they going?
[03:13:31.159 --> 03:13:34.079]  That's the unknown element that we don't know.
[03:13:34.340 --> 03:13:42.420]  But I could speculate that I would say banks are having to take physical delivery now to cover their short positions.
[03:13:42.659 --> 03:13:56.139]  Or you've got companies, the industrial users of silver, let's say Samsung, they're buying their inventory now before tariffs hit it and the price goes up 50 to 100%.
[03:13:56.139 --> 03:14:01.559]  So you're seeing a massive supply and demand constraint here.
[03:14:01.719 --> 03:14:03.659]  And this is going to be really big.
[03:14:04.319 --> 03:14:05.340]  Really big for silver.
[03:14:05.459 --> 03:14:07.399]  And so we're starting to see this move now.
[03:14:07.479 --> 03:14:16.100]  It's broken out of a technical pattern, right, where the next thing that we could see is possibly $40 an ounce silver.
[03:14:16.700 --> 03:14:19.860]  Realize, it's $32 right now.
[03:14:19.959 --> 03:14:26.979]  So when you look at the demand for silver and where it's been from just China, let's just look at China, okay?
[03:14:29.040 --> 03:14:37.120]  China in 2023 used 20,000 tons of silver for manufacturing.
[03:14:37.540 --> 03:14:49.540]  In 2025, next year, they're projected to consume 12,000 tons solely for photovoltaic and electric vehicle applications.
[03:14:49.780 --> 03:14:50.139]  That's it.
[03:14:50.600 --> 03:14:58.690]  So last year, 2023, the total Supply and demand for silver was 20,000 tons.
[03:14:58.930 --> 03:15:02.850]  Next year, 12,000 is just for those two things.
[03:15:03.600 --> 03:15:06.000]  Right, so what did China do recently?
[03:15:06.540 --> 03:15:20.579]  China approved a significant stimulus program that's gonna further boost its silver consumption in 2025. And then like Alex and I talked about, oh man, Alex, I think this was maybe three months ago.
[03:15:20.879 --> 03:15:24.280]  We basically exposed the story about Samsung.
[03:15:24.639 --> 03:15:37.569]  Samsung created a new solid state battery that will charge an electric vehicle Fully, not in like 12 or 17 hours, like what it takes now, but in nine minutes.
[03:15:38.190 --> 03:15:58.870]  So that, actually, they're starting to build up inventory for that because that technology becomes live, estimated now by 2027. So what we're seeing here is if you were an electric vehicle manufacturer, why would you not want to have solid-state silver batteries if you can fully charge a car in nine minutes versus a dozen hours?
[03:15:59.700 --> 03:16:02.559]  Well, you're gonna be behind the eight ball if you don't.
[03:16:02.680 --> 03:16:15.620]  So this rapid electrification efforts of everything from solar power to solid state batteries to electric vehicles is absolutely massive, right?
[03:16:15.620 --> 03:16:16.659]  It's absolutely massive.
[03:16:17.920 --> 03:16:25.260]  Right now, 30% of all global mining of silver is actually just from silver mines.
[03:16:25.559 --> 03:16:30.120]  70% comes as a byproduct of copper mining, gold mining, things of that nature.
[03:16:30.340 --> 03:16:34.920]  So what we're seeing then is a massive supply chain disruption.
[03:16:35.100 --> 03:16:40.959]  We're going to run out of supply of silver, and it's gonna happen Before we know it, right?
[03:16:41.059 --> 03:16:47.059]  Which is why you're seeing the futures prices have this huge spread over spot price right now.
[03:16:47.280 --> 03:16:52.559]  This tells us that silver is going to grow and it's going to grow pretty dramatically.
[03:16:53.139 --> 03:16:57.159]  And it's a lot of this is because of Trump's tariff policies, right?
[03:16:57.280 --> 03:17:00.459]  Great for America, great for all of us who invested in gold and silver.
[03:17:00.659 --> 03:17:03.299]  And there's more to come after the break.
[03:17:03.459 --> 03:17:04.920]  We'll be right back with you.
[03:17:05.370 --> 03:17:07.649]  We've been through a lot at Infowars.
[03:17:07.829 --> 03:17:10.350]  America and the world has been through hell.
[03:17:10.569 --> 03:17:11.829]  But the Great Awakening is here.
[03:17:12.290 --> 03:17:13.870]  The globalists are in full panic mode.
[03:17:14.049 --> 03:17:26.590]  And now it's more important than ever to keep the most powerful, effective voices at exposing the globalist agenda and promoting the Team Humanity agenda on air.
[03:17:27.159 --> 03:17:35.579]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, is owned by great patriots and some of the top makers of Patriot apparel.

[03:18:03.430 --> 03:18:06.170]  We have two new campaign coins.
[03:18:06.309 --> 03:18:08.010]  Two different coins right here.
[03:18:08.270 --> 03:18:16.819]  One is the answer to 1984 is 1776. And on one side, it's got the Gadsden flag.
[03:18:16.819 --> 03:18:20.040]  On the other side, it's got yours truly.
[03:18:20.340 --> 03:18:32.200]  The other great coin is 1776 limited edition coin with a Gadsden flag, don't tread on me, and 1776. Both are powerful coins, powerful coins.
[03:18:33.609 --> 03:18:34.569]  They weigh a lot.
[03:18:34.670 --> 03:18:35.250]  They feel good.
[03:18:35.370 --> 03:18:36.069]  They're a great gift.
[03:18:36.229 --> 03:18:37.950]  They're a great memento.
[03:18:38.049 --> 03:18:39.170]  They're a great keepsake.
[03:18:39.309 --> 03:18:41.209]  They're a great conversation starter.
[03:18:41.530 --> 03:18:48.329]  And both these coins are $14.97 at thealexjonesstore.com.

[03:19:05.120 --> 03:19:07.959]  So we're seeing gold and silver go up.
[03:19:08.120 --> 03:19:15.260]  Now, over the last six months, China stopped purchasing gold for whatever reason, right?
[03:19:15.360 --> 03:19:21.639]  They were massive purchasers, and then they just kind of went on a hiatus, and we don't know why.
[03:19:21.739 --> 03:19:27.600]  But during this time, they were encouraging their citizens to buy gold, all the Chinese people.
[03:19:27.739 --> 03:19:28.600]  So why?
[03:19:28.719 --> 03:19:40.510]  Because they literally, even after the six-month hiatus, they have Thousands and thousands and thousands of tons of gold backing their currency, right?
[03:19:40.590 --> 03:19:44.950]  They want to back the BRICS currency, have it be 40% weighted into gold.
[03:19:45.110 --> 03:19:48.190]  So they're buying mountains of it.
[03:19:48.309 --> 03:19:54.510]  They're the largest miner of gold in the world as a country, and they don't sell any of it.
[03:19:54.799 --> 03:19:55.979]  None of it hits the open market.
[03:19:56.139 --> 03:19:58.020]  Everything they mine, they keep for themselves.
[03:19:58.280 --> 03:20:02.799]  But they're also the second largest now purchaser of gold on the planet.
[03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:09.020]  Poland, of all countries, surpassed them in 2024 as the largest purchaser, right?
[03:20:11.399 --> 03:20:13.260]  They did an about face, right?
[03:20:13.520 --> 03:20:16.520]  So last week, they made an announcement.
[03:20:17.200 --> 03:20:22.379]  They're three of the largest commercial banks in China, told their citizens, it's like, hey, you know what?
[03:20:22.540 --> 03:20:24.440]  You guys have all been purchasing gold, that's great.
[03:20:24.940 --> 03:20:30.420]  However, any purchases of gold moving forward, we are going to block those transactions.
[03:20:30.840 --> 03:20:32.040]  It's like, what gives?
[03:20:32.540 --> 03:20:35.120]  Does China now all of a sudden hate gold?
[03:20:35.319 --> 03:20:35.739]  Nope.
[03:20:36.479 --> 03:20:43.360]  They love it, or else they wouldn't be buying it and keep having thousands of tons of this stuff to back their currency.
[03:20:43.559 --> 03:20:51.319]  But there's a difference, just like in this country, what the government wants and what the government wants the people to have.
[03:20:51.719 --> 03:20:53.079]  They still love gold.
[03:20:53.239 --> 03:21:09.280]  They just don't want the people to have it, which tells me These developments with central bank digital currency and this digital money and the complete intrusion on our lives and the loss of privacy and the loss of our financial freedom is going to be here before we know it.
[03:21:09.600 --> 03:21:11.540]  It's really gonna be here before we know it.
[03:21:11.719 --> 03:21:22.840]  Because there's no reason why China would tell their citizens to stop buying gold unless They don't want people to have a private transaction.
[03:21:23.079 --> 03:21:30.340]  They don't want people to have a private asset, something that gets out of their digital system, which is complete people control.
[03:21:31.139 --> 03:21:45.379]  And when you go back to what the World Economic Forum, which by the way, World Economic Forum is meeting in Davos, Switzerland, coming up here pretty soon, where they're gonna expose yet even more mayhem on the world, I am sure, because they do every single year.
[03:21:45.540 --> 03:21:48.680]  It was last year that they said CBDCs were coming.
[03:21:49.360 --> 03:21:54.059]  And it was two years ago that Dr. Pippa Malmgren at the World Economic Forum says, you know what?
[03:21:54.260 --> 03:21:56.280]  The CBDC thing, it's gonna be great.
[03:21:56.379 --> 03:21:57.319]  It's programmable money.
[03:21:57.440 --> 03:22:07.559]  And they're bragging about how they can control a population by shutting off people's bank accounts based on their ideology and their use of funds.
[03:22:07.620 --> 03:22:09.420]  And if it doesn't match up with theirs, they'll shut them off.
[03:22:09.579 --> 03:22:22.110]  So when you see what's happening in China and the commercial banks Now, stopping and blocking the purchase of precious metals by their citizens tells me that they don't want people to have a private asset.
[03:22:22.409 --> 03:22:24.229]  So something big is coming, right?
[03:22:24.409 --> 03:22:26.129]  But I don't think it stops.
[03:22:26.760 --> 03:22:28.879]  With three of the largest commercial banks in China.
[03:22:29.079 --> 03:22:34.579]  I think it's gonna spread like these horrible tentacles to other banks in China and then to other countries around the world.
[03:22:34.680 --> 03:22:42.280]  Because you realize there's over 90% of the world's countries are adopting central bank digital currency standards.
[03:22:42.559 --> 03:22:47.879]  And this is why you're seeing gold and silver go up in price.
[03:22:48.020 --> 03:22:52.680]  This is why you're seeing cryptocurrency like Bitcoin going up in price.
[03:22:52.959 --> 03:22:56.590]  Because people We're good to go.
[03:23:24.500 --> 03:23:26.559]  And you're seeing the same thing in gold and silver.
[03:23:26.680 --> 03:23:28.440]  It's just a different type of private asset.
[03:23:28.600 --> 03:23:30.860]  One is physical delivery that you can use for barter.
[03:23:31.139 --> 03:23:33.000]  The other one is decentralized blockchain.
[03:23:33.680 --> 03:23:37.379]  Everybody's got a different comfort level with technology.
[03:23:37.399 --> 03:23:44.760]  And most of my clients are going to say, I don't know about this cryptocurrency stuff.
[03:23:44.760 --> 03:23:45.739]  I don't understand it.
[03:23:45.799 --> 03:23:47.879]  And I'm not technologically savvy.
[03:23:48.889 --> 03:23:51.709]  For those of you who are, have a nice balanced approach to it, right?
[03:23:51.790 --> 03:23:58.790]  For those of you that are not, go with the tried and true that's been around for centuries, you know, since the beginning of time.
[03:23:59.069 --> 03:24:05.909]  It's what kings and kingdoms have fought after and tried to acquire and hold was gold.
[03:24:06.559 --> 03:24:06.760]  Right?
[03:24:07.020 --> 03:24:09.200]  So you're seeing this blockage.
[03:24:09.260 --> 03:24:13.379]  And what I think is gonna happen with that is banks start to block transactions.
[03:24:14.780 --> 03:24:23.559]  The globalists and the global banking cartels are gonna say, look, we're gonna destroy the demand for gold, silver.
[03:24:23.680 --> 03:24:24.200]  No, they're not.
[03:24:24.520 --> 03:24:25.979]  They're gonna increase it.
[03:24:26.639 --> 03:24:28.479]  Imagine, all of you viewers out there, right?
[03:24:28.579 --> 03:24:38.290]  If you're thinking like me, if you're thinking like Alex, and you think, well, If somebody's gonna block my transactions in the future, I better get it now, quite honestly, right?
[03:24:38.549 --> 03:24:46.649]  So this is what's starting to happen, is the supply is diminishing, the demand is outpacing that, and you're starting to see the prices really go up.
[03:24:46.809 --> 03:24:55.270]  So I think the unintended consequence of those globalist actions are actually causing silver and gold to go up a lot.
[03:24:55.610 --> 03:24:58.149]  And I'm talking a lot, right?
[03:25:00.219 --> 03:25:07.979]  When you look at what causes things like gold and silver to go up, it's not just economic considerations.
[03:25:07.979 --> 03:25:10.700]  It's not just banks running out of money.
[03:25:10.920 --> 03:25:12.860]  It's not banks being undercapitalized.
[03:25:13.000 --> 03:25:20.879]  It's not the potential for the condo cliff in Florida that's happening right after the hurricanes.
[03:25:20.879 --> 03:25:26.860]  And you've had entire condo complexes that just fell apart, right?
[03:25:26.959 --> 03:25:28.340]  They collapsed.
[03:25:29.139 --> 03:25:33.659]  Now, you've got massive amounts of HOA fees.
[03:25:34.079 --> 03:25:39.620]  There's one complex in Miami, West Palm Beach area.
[03:25:40.319 --> 03:25:43.540]  They're going to have $200,000 assessments.
[03:25:44.590 --> 03:25:48.850]  On each condo owner because they've got to rebuild these things.
[03:25:49.010 --> 03:25:54.709]  And most of the condos, 70% of all the condos on the east coast of Florida are over 30 years old.
[03:25:54.829 --> 03:25:56.090]  They have to retrofit, right?
[03:25:56.170 --> 03:25:57.069]  Well, what's that going to mean?
[03:25:57.450 --> 03:26:03.010]  The massive amount of supply because people are selling these things before they get an assessment.
[03:26:03.329 --> 03:26:08.190]  And so now DeSantis is having to step in and say, I don't know what we're going to do here, right?
[03:26:08.270 --> 03:26:10.610]  This is unprecedented, right?
[03:26:10.729 --> 03:26:28.069]  Where people aren't going to want to Have these condos if they know that if everyone's leaving, they live in a condo complex with 100 people living in it, 100 different families, and 60 or 70% of them leave because they don't want the assessments.
[03:26:28.069 --> 03:26:33.870]  And the assessments are gonna be spread between even a smaller number of people, and they become larger, right?
[03:26:33.989 --> 03:26:38.129]  So there's the new emerging stories of real estate collapses.
[03:26:38.250 --> 03:26:39.590]  This is what Trump is inheriting.
[03:26:40.250 --> 03:26:46.969]  This is gonna be difficult for him and Elon Musk and Vivek.
[03:26:47.549 --> 03:26:50.469]  It's not just cutting expenditures, right?
[03:26:50.569 --> 03:26:54.290]  They wanna cut $2 trillion of government expenditures.
[03:26:54.389 --> 03:26:58.370]  They're gonna do that by getting rid of even entire departments like the Department of Education.
[03:26:58.729 --> 03:27:04.270]  But when you're talking about slashing that much, you're gonna have to start cutting into entitlements.
[03:27:04.909 --> 03:27:15.409]  Which is the political nightmare that Congress is going to have to decide, do they want to do what's right for the people and actually get us financially stable and secure again?
[03:27:15.450 --> 03:27:18.069]  Or are we just going to continue to print money willy-nilly?
[03:27:18.229 --> 03:27:22.930]  I don't think that with this new administration, you're going to just be able to print money willy-nilly.
[03:27:24.039 --> 03:27:27.659]  Because the BRICS nations took away the petrodollar status.
[03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:39.940]  I mean, this is why you need a really, really, really strong leader to actually help and tell Congress, you better actually have some fiscal responsibility and more discretion in your spending.
[03:27:40.159 --> 03:27:46.979]  See, this is how you're gonna make America great again, but it's going to be kind of a hard path to get to that point.
[03:27:47.100 --> 03:27:48.520]  There's gonna be some pain points.
[03:27:49.069 --> 03:27:59.750]  Because when you just can't print money like there's nobody's business, you're going to see certain markets that have been held together with stimulus money being propped up are going to come crashing down.
[03:27:59.930 --> 03:28:02.069]  It's always a function of money, right?
[03:28:02.190 --> 03:28:04.270]  The banking system, why do banks fail?
[03:28:04.930 --> 03:28:05.329]  Simple.
[03:28:05.770 --> 03:28:11.110]  Banks fail because you have more withdrawals coming in out than you have deposits going in.
[03:28:11.430 --> 03:28:19.170]  Right in an inflationary world, as we saw this morning, the numbers just came out on inflation a little bit hotter than expected.
[03:28:19.510 --> 03:28:22.229]  Well, of course, a little bit hotter than expected.
[03:28:22.610 --> 03:28:25.469]  And on core inflation was up 3.3%.
[03:28:26.750 --> 03:28:30.149]  You know, from month to month, it's like, okay, this is pretty bad, right?
[03:28:30.270 --> 03:28:31.549]  This is not good.
[03:28:31.829 --> 03:28:36.270]  So Trump is inheriting an inflation economy.
[03:28:36.489 --> 03:28:39.969]  When 2017, when he came in, it was different.
[03:28:40.190 --> 03:28:43.209]  Interest rates were very, very low, right?
[03:28:43.409 --> 03:28:45.110]  You actually had...
[03:28:46.850 --> 03:28:56.229]  A lot of money coming into America back then, even back then, which allowed him to have almost free reign on his fiscal programs.
[03:28:56.729 --> 03:28:59.450]  This time it's different because America's tapped out.
[03:28:59.629 --> 03:29:07.610]  So what he inherited last time was a country that was relatively financially healthy.
[03:29:07.850 --> 03:29:09.989]  It wasn't healthy, we still had mountains of debt.
[03:29:10.209 --> 03:29:12.629]  But now he inherited an empty refrigerator.
[03:29:13.290 --> 03:29:14.829]  Literally, there's nothing there.
[03:29:15.519 --> 03:29:16.700]  Unemployment is sky high.
[03:29:16.860 --> 03:29:17.899]  Inflation is persisting.
[03:29:18.000 --> 03:29:20.299]  Interest rates are much higher than they were back then.
[03:29:20.459 --> 03:29:29.219]  And he's starting at a much lower starting point because of four years of Bidenomics.
[03:29:30.079 --> 03:29:31.799]  And so, but can he get it done?
[03:29:31.920 --> 03:29:32.659]  Of course he can.
[03:29:32.799 --> 03:29:37.440]  And he will, because he's got an amazing team that he's assembling to get this done.
[03:29:37.559 --> 03:29:38.680]  But there's gonna be opposition.
[03:29:38.899 --> 03:29:40.860]  There's gonna be opposition from China.
[03:29:41.020 --> 03:29:46.079]  There's going to be already, because of the tariffs, what is Trump going to face?
[03:29:46.479 --> 03:29:48.500]  China retaliating, right?
[03:29:48.840 --> 03:29:56.840]  They're basically banning exports of many strategic rare earth metals and things like that to the United States.
[03:29:57.559 --> 03:30:00.579]  So they're already playing this game against Trump.
[03:30:00.659 --> 03:30:03.540]  And this is where you need a strong leader to actually win these things.
[03:30:03.659 --> 03:30:04.780]  And we are going to win.
[03:30:04.940 --> 03:30:16.540]  But one of the big things that causes gold and silver to go up is perception of kind of global peace, right?
[03:30:18.520 --> 03:30:25.860]  To the first four years of Trump, you look back to really 20 years of Reagan policies.
[03:30:26.479 --> 03:30:29.700]  Because Reagan was there for eight, Bush there for eight, Clinton there for eight.
[03:30:29.799 --> 03:30:31.959]  They all used Reagan's economic policies.
[03:30:32.200 --> 03:30:35.180]  And during that time, you had interest rates that came way down.
[03:30:35.319 --> 03:30:38.680]  Remember, interest rates in 1983 were 17%.
[03:30:39.610 --> 03:30:40.950]  On a 30-year mortgage.
[03:30:41.170 --> 03:30:44.649]  If he had bad credit, it was above 20, for crying out loud.
[03:30:45.049 --> 03:30:51.809]  So Reagan lowered those down massively, and that created a growth economy, right?
[03:30:51.850 --> 03:30:53.129]  So the stock market was booming.
[03:30:53.350 --> 03:30:54.469]  Real estate was booming.
[03:30:55.030 --> 03:30:56.709]  It created jobs, right?
[03:30:56.790 --> 03:30:58.850]  Because people had more money to spend.
[03:30:59.229 --> 03:31:03.930]  That made corporate America more profitable, and they would hire more people, and now there's more people to spend.
[03:31:04.370 --> 03:31:12.719]  See, this is what Trump is going to do again, but It's gonna be harder this time because he's starting from such a bad position.
[03:31:13.479 --> 03:31:18.379]  And he is gonna have inflation in a Trump White House.
[03:31:18.559 --> 03:31:19.280]  There will be.
[03:31:19.420 --> 03:31:21.239]  But not all inflation is bad.
[03:31:21.379 --> 03:31:28.920]  We have to remember that inflation just means higher prices is part of a growing economy because more people can afford the higher prices.
[03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:34.270]  See, as long as wages keep up with inflation, we're gonna be just fine.
[03:31:34.549 --> 03:31:42.790]  The problem with Biden's economy is wages were coming down while inflation was persisting, and this gap became really huge and massive.
[03:31:42.969 --> 03:31:49.430]  And now we've got people that can't afford to live, and they're living paycheck to paycheck, and they can't pay their debts.
[03:31:49.469 --> 03:31:55.430]  And they have to have this horrible tradeoff of, are we gonna pay our rent or our mortgage or our utilities and buy groceries?
[03:31:55.610 --> 03:31:56.889]  Or what are we gonna do?
[03:31:57.860 --> 03:31:59.860]  Right, and so they curtail their spending.
[03:32:00.059 --> 03:32:07.920]  So, but one of the biggest fundamental things is geopolitical conflict that caused gold and silver to go up.
[03:32:08.180 --> 03:32:13.280]  Well, what are we seeing since over the weekend Damascus fell?
[03:32:14.560 --> 03:32:23.239]  Syria no longer has Assad, a secular Islamic leader, running the show.
[03:32:23.360 --> 03:32:28.100]  For over 50 years, 50, the Assad family has been running Syria, right?
[03:32:28.219 --> 03:32:30.659]  But now, it's been overtaken by Al-Qaeda.
[03:32:31.559 --> 03:32:34.040]  So what happens geopolitically?
[03:32:34.260 --> 03:32:43.500]  You've got Israel right here, and you've got Lebanon, you've got the Palestinians, you've got now Syria falling to al-Qaeda.
[03:32:43.680 --> 03:32:49.780]  They're surrounded by kind of rogue religious people.
[03:32:51.250 --> 03:32:52.250]  Dictators, right?
[03:32:52.670 --> 03:32:56.209]  That want to do away with the big Satan and the little Satan, America and Israel.
[03:32:56.489 --> 03:33:01.989]  So Israel's completely surrounded now without the buffer in Syria.
[03:33:02.110 --> 03:33:04.209]  So what did Israel do?
[03:33:04.590 --> 03:33:06.250]  I mean, just an onslaught.
[03:33:06.450 --> 03:33:16.709]  Over the last couple of days, 250 missiles have gone into Damascus to try to destabilize Al-Qaeda before they can actually gain any kind of momentum.
[03:33:17.270 --> 03:33:19.309]  Well, what happened?
[03:33:20.290 --> 03:33:33.569]  Last time, we had a big insurgence against a rogue kind of religious leader in the Islamic world.
[03:33:34.010 --> 03:33:34.969]  9-11 happened.
[03:33:35.920 --> 03:33:36.139]  Right?
[03:33:36.319 --> 03:33:39.659]  So what we're going to possibly see is retaliation.
[03:33:39.819 --> 03:33:44.379]  And this is, again, where it takes a strong leader, right, to overcome that.
[03:33:44.520 --> 03:33:47.079]  But with Assad leaving, we don't know where he is.
[03:33:47.180 --> 03:33:48.799]  Maybe he fled to Russia.
[03:33:48.959 --> 03:33:52.940]  Maybe he's in the United Arab Emirates in Dubai.
[03:33:53.079 --> 03:33:54.780]  We don't know where the Assad family left.
[03:33:54.879 --> 03:33:56.440]  All we know, there's now a void.
[03:33:57.059 --> 03:33:58.879]  There's no longer a strongman there.
[03:33:59.079 --> 03:34:04.579]  And just like what happened in Iraq, you're gonna have factions of warlords starting to run the show.
[03:34:04.659 --> 03:34:06.940]  And that's gonna be very destabilizing.
[03:34:08.159 --> 03:34:15.639]  Destabilizing on a geopolitical scale when countries are already at war is going to increase the probability of war.
[03:34:24.790 --> 03:34:35.870]  Well, sitting on the sidelines in cash five years ago, It was a good option, right?
[03:34:35.969 --> 03:34:37.829]  Just to take a very defensive posture.
[03:34:38.030 --> 03:34:48.389]  But now with banks being underfunded, and like what Alex and I have talked about, FDIC only having 1.17% of all deposits insured, banks running out of capital.
[03:34:48.629 --> 03:34:53.790]  You've got unrealized losses in commercial real estate, not just here, but in China and all over the world.
[03:34:54.190 --> 03:34:57.590]  Boy, these are destabilizing economic and political things.
[03:34:57.770 --> 03:35:02.430]  And so when people have that, perception is reality.
[03:35:03.779 --> 03:35:11.479]  Whether you like it or not, whether you believe it or not, whether it's real or not, right?
[03:35:11.620 --> 03:35:15.159]  We don't know if there's gonna be military incursions bigger than what we already have.
[03:35:15.159 --> 03:35:15.639]  We don't know.
[03:35:15.760 --> 03:35:19.319]  But in people's hearts and minds, they think that there's going to be.
[03:35:19.479 --> 03:35:23.319]  And this starts to impact the psychology of investors.
[03:35:23.950 --> 03:35:33.409]  Right, and so I think what we're going to see is normal traditional markets start to come down because A, there's no stimulus money anymore when we lost the petrodollar.
[03:35:34.370 --> 03:35:39.329]  Granted, the perception that Trump is going to grow the economy is big.
[03:35:40.219 --> 03:35:42.059]  It's big and massive, right?
[03:35:42.219 --> 03:35:48.739]  And the deregulation in the crypto space is why cryptocurrencies are exploding, why the stock market's really high right now.
[03:35:48.840 --> 03:35:51.799]  But you have to realize, these things are always a function of revenue.
[03:35:52.260 --> 03:35:57.680]  And it's going to take a while for Trump's policies to really take effect.
[03:35:58.059 --> 03:36:04.000]  And in that transition is where people could actually lose their shirts or allocate properly to build for the next chapter.
[03:36:04.879 --> 03:36:15.180]  This is where we're starting to see perception take place and become reality as the demand for precious metals is greatly outstripping the supply.
[03:36:15.559 --> 03:36:27.280]  It's just a function of the geopolitical, political landscape, the economics uncertainties, the unrealized losses on banks' portfolios and balance sheets, right?
[03:36:27.479 --> 03:36:30.819]  So take advantage of that, right?
[03:36:30.879 --> 03:36:33.760]  So how do we do that?
[03:36:34.559 --> 03:36:37.559]  So there's different ways you can do it.
[03:36:37.659 --> 03:36:50.260]  Now, you can take gold or silver for physical delivery at home, in which case you would want small You know, bars, one ounce rounds of silver, 10 ounce bars.
[03:36:50.620 --> 03:36:52.780]  People that have storage can do 100 ounce bars.
[03:36:53.579 --> 03:36:56.920]  But if you don't have the space for it, well then store it.
[03:36:57.340 --> 03:37:05.000]  Store it at a private depository that's fully insured in a segregated account like the one that we recommend all of our clients go to in Texas.
[03:37:05.319 --> 03:37:06.219]  Safe, that's right.
[03:37:06.459 --> 03:37:07.159]  Store all of mine.
[03:37:08.280 --> 03:37:10.340]  See, the key is just get started.
[03:37:10.520 --> 03:37:11.040]  It doesn't matter.
[03:37:11.719 --> 03:37:14.100]  If you say, I'm never gonna have something stored.
[03:37:14.139 --> 03:37:15.040]  I don't trust anybody.
[03:37:15.260 --> 03:37:16.360]  Great, then keep it at home.
[03:37:16.739 --> 03:37:20.020]  Some of you that say, well, I don't trust my neighborhood.
[03:37:20.360 --> 03:37:22.840]  I don't feel safe having precious metals at home.
[03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:24.620]  Well, then great, then store it, right?
[03:37:24.739 --> 03:37:30.879]  But most of the capital that we see coming into our country is through retirement accounts, right?
[03:37:31.020 --> 03:37:31.739]  Through IRAs.
[03:37:32.020 --> 03:37:36.739]  Doing IRA rollovers that you can actually then allocate into physical metals.
[03:37:37.710 --> 03:37:39.209]  I'm not talking about ETFs.
[03:37:39.270 --> 03:37:40.250]  I'm not talking about mining shares.
[03:37:40.370 --> 03:37:42.610]  I'm not talking about certificates or stocks.
[03:37:42.610 --> 03:37:50.909]  I'm talking about physical metals, 100-ounce bars of silver, 10-ounce bars of silver, 1-ounce rounds, 1-ounce gold bars or kilobars of gold, right?
[03:37:51.049 --> 03:37:54.549]  So it's physical that somebody has to take delivery of.
[03:37:54.690 --> 03:37:57.190]  In this case, it would be the IRA custodian.
[03:37:58.389 --> 03:38:02.069]  And the way that our firm operates is different than other firms, right?
[03:38:02.209 --> 03:38:08.270]  Because we want you to realize 100% of the gain of your investments, because ultimately you're gonna sell.
[03:38:08.930 --> 03:38:12.950]  Everybody's goal as a wise and prudent investor is to buy low and sell high.
[03:38:13.049 --> 03:38:16.770]  Well, when you decide to sell, we don't charge anything, just like what Alex always tells you.
[03:38:16.930 --> 03:38:18.750]  We don't charge a commission when you liquidate.
[03:38:18.870 --> 03:38:20.850]  I want that all to be yours.
[03:38:21.600 --> 03:38:23.280]  And then when you purchase, it's 8%.
[03:38:23.280 --> 03:38:31.940]  Well, that gives us a really nice, easy, simple, very few moving parts, knowing what the entry cost is.
[03:38:32.059 --> 03:38:35.139]  And then when we don't charge anything moving forward, nothing to liquidate, all right.
[03:38:35.559 --> 03:38:40.159]  Silver and gold doesn't need to move that much for you to break even, and then everything after that's pure profit.
[03:38:40.579 --> 03:38:42.319]  See, look at the banks.
[03:38:42.899 --> 03:38:43.899]  The banks.
[03:38:44.719 --> 03:38:49.780]  Are gonna lose money hand over fist as silver goes up because they're shorting it.
[03:38:50.000 --> 03:38:52.479]  They've been manipulating the price for years.
[03:38:52.600 --> 03:39:01.579]  So this is where once you identify What they're doing and what makes them profitable or not, right?
[03:39:01.760 --> 03:39:04.399]  It's like, okay, we don't like central banks.
[03:39:04.540 --> 03:39:06.920]  We don't like their intrusion on our lives.
[03:39:07.020 --> 03:39:09.659]  We don't like it that central bank digital currency is coming.
[03:39:09.780 --> 03:39:15.219]  We don't like it that our spending is gonna be tested against ideological differences.
[03:39:16.069 --> 03:39:16.870]  We don't like that.
[03:39:17.090 --> 03:39:27.809]  And so most of Info Warriors and our clients don't really care if the banks start to fail as long as you are allocated properly.
[03:39:28.030 --> 03:39:30.069]  Here's my encouragement to everybody.
[03:39:30.920 --> 03:39:44.979]  This is, you know, our investments that we have made into physical metals as an insurance policy against a collapsing dollar have the added benefit of growth and a lot of growth over the last few years, right?
[03:39:45.120 --> 03:39:47.559]  And here's where perception comes into play, right?
[03:39:47.739 --> 03:39:53.299]  Since Trump was elected, Gold and silver came down for like two and a half weeks.
[03:39:53.620 --> 03:39:56.780]  Came down because the perception was he's gonna grow the economy.
[03:39:56.899 --> 03:39:57.780]  This is gonna be great.
[03:39:58.120 --> 03:40:03.979]  And there's gonna be tariffs on foreign goods in the US. We're gonna make America great again, make America healthy again.
[03:40:04.180 --> 03:40:10.760]  We're gonna actually get back some of our lost freedoms that the enemy has stolen, that the devil has taken away from us.
[03:40:10.920 --> 03:40:15.120]  Our religious freedoms, political freedoms, economic freedoms, personal freedoms.
[03:40:15.299 --> 03:40:16.459]  They're all gonna come back.
[03:40:16.600 --> 03:40:27.440]  But now, a few weeks later, when the dust settles, People are realizing, whoa, there's a lot of demand for silver from an industrial capacity.
[03:40:27.719 --> 03:40:38.459]  And when Trump grows the economy, and 90% of the demand for silver is industrial demand, it's not investor demand like you and I, it's industrial demand.
[03:40:38.659 --> 03:40:44.229]  And he's gonna grow the economy, that's gonna add To the acceleration of the price, right?
[03:40:44.430 --> 03:40:53.190]  So I know that sometimes I may sound like a broken record because we keep coming up with the same solution to protect and preserve and to grow and to thrive.
[03:40:53.790 --> 03:40:57.729]  Well, it's because it is the best solution for right now.
[03:40:57.829 --> 03:40:59.969]  If it wasn't, I wouldn't talk about it.
[03:41:00.149 --> 03:41:02.450]  But it is, right?
[03:41:02.649 --> 03:41:13.500]  So when you look at these tensions, When you look at the persisting inflation, which the Fed can't figure out, right?
[03:41:13.639 --> 03:41:18.899]  You keep looking at these numbers and it's like, man, the inflation went up again.
[03:41:19.340 --> 03:41:21.860]  And now they want to keep lowering rates.
[03:41:22.040 --> 03:41:28.799]  Well, if you lower rates when inflation is still persisting, the inflation is going to get worse.
[03:41:29.770 --> 03:41:33.790]  People say, well, Kirk, aren't you talking about out of both sides of your mouth?
[03:41:33.950 --> 03:41:39.209]  Trump is gonna grow the economy and inflation is gonna persist and he wants to lower rates to try to stimulate things.
[03:41:39.370 --> 03:41:41.190]  It's like, yes, he does.
[03:41:41.629 --> 03:41:47.690]  And I'm not concerned about inflation when you have wage growth that's going to come with it.
[03:41:48.030 --> 03:41:56.409]  What I am concerned about is the last four years, how you've had wage reduction, unemployment increases.
[03:41:57.309 --> 03:42:04.290]  And then you just print money willy-nilly to try to stimulate the economy ever since COVID. And people are hurting.
[03:42:04.610 --> 03:42:06.309]  People in America are hurting.
[03:42:06.829 --> 03:42:16.049]  And the de-dollarization efforts from the globalists and from other countries and from the global banks, they're going to continue.
[03:42:16.049 --> 03:42:17.809]  It's going to be an onslaught.
[03:42:17.950 --> 03:42:26.629]  But here's where we started the show with, right, was the prophecy out of Isaiah 9. Talking about the birth of Jesus, right?
[03:42:26.750 --> 03:42:29.870]  He's the Prince of Peace, our counselor.
[03:42:30.049 --> 03:42:31.229]  He brings us peace, right?
[03:42:31.409 --> 03:42:33.870]  And the government will be on his shoulders.
[03:42:34.569 --> 03:42:35.629]  He's like, don't worry.
[03:42:36.510 --> 03:42:39.309]  You know, Trump is an answer to prayer.
[03:42:39.870 --> 03:42:43.649]  That's one thing I know about prayer and God, is he always answers them.
[03:42:43.729 --> 03:42:47.930]  Sometimes he answers our prayers in a way that we don't want him to.
[03:42:48.870 --> 03:42:50.290]  But he knows best, right?
[03:42:50.489 --> 03:42:52.389]  But Trump, to me, is an answer to prayer.
[03:42:52.590 --> 03:42:53.790]  There is no way.
[03:42:54.510 --> 03:43:06.270]  I can't see a plausible way that America would have succeeded and been around five years from now without Trump being elected.
[03:43:06.270 --> 03:43:07.670]  That is an answer to prayer.
[03:43:08.090 --> 03:43:10.329]  But here's what I think is also coming.
[03:43:10.549 --> 03:43:14.909]  I think two to three years from now, we won't have paper currency anymore.
[03:43:15.629 --> 03:43:21.850]  We're heading down the digital space where you're going to have digital wallets, digital money, cryptocurrencies, things of that nature.
[03:43:22.069 --> 03:43:27.370]  And with that and central bank hands, it's going to be complete loss of financial freedom.
[03:43:27.610 --> 03:43:28.829]  Take advantage of these.
[03:43:29.010 --> 03:43:31.809]  Call us, 720-605-3900.
[03:43:32.030 --> 03:43:33.170]  Let us know Alex sent you.
[03:43:33.329 --> 03:43:34.170]  We'll take good care of you.
[03:43:35.079 --> 03:43:42.440]  Well, the winner, Chris Delaro, is here in studio from New Jersey, former F-16 Air Force fighter pilot and flew the big 777s.
[03:43:42.479 --> 03:43:43.559]  What an amazing aircraft.
[03:43:43.819 --> 03:43:45.219]  Chris, I gotta say, man, we love you.
[03:43:45.299 --> 03:43:46.040]  Thanks for the support.
[03:43:46.620 --> 03:43:47.559]  I love you, Alex.
[03:43:47.719 --> 03:43:49.819]  I love Bigley, Nate, Colin.
[03:43:50.100 --> 03:43:50.459]  Thanks, Chris.
[03:43:50.540 --> 03:43:55.639]  This is one of the pinnacles in my life, and there have been a few good ones, but this is right up there, just being in this studio.
[03:43:55.639 --> 03:43:56.799]  I never imagined I'd be.
[03:43:56.819 --> 03:43:57.780]  Well, we appreciate you, brother.
[03:43:57.860 --> 03:43:58.479]  You're the reason we're here.
[03:43:58.739 --> 03:44:01.040]  It's so cool how cool the listeners are.
[03:44:01.120 --> 03:44:01.500]  It is.
[03:44:01.879 --> 03:44:02.000]  Yes.
[03:44:02.180 --> 03:44:02.700]  Wow, thank you.
[03:44:02.930 --> 03:44:04.010]  The listeners are amazing.
[03:44:04.250 --> 03:44:09.989]  Like, everyone that goes to the Alex Jones store, obviously you're in it to win this truck, but this experience of coming on the show, how is this, Chris?
[03:44:10.170 --> 03:44:13.850]  I mean, is this not, this is like a, it's a dream, I would feel like, for the winner, right?
[03:44:14.049 --> 03:44:25.290]  Fortunately, I slept pretty good last night, but it's been very stressful because he said, Colin said, you're going on the show, and I was like, I'm a little camera shy, but here I am.
[03:44:25.409 --> 03:44:26.590]  You've done well, Lord Vader.
[03:44:27.579 --> 03:44:29.940]  I said, I'll do whatever I need to do to help Alex and Bigley.
[03:44:30.620 --> 03:44:31.780]  Well, I'm glad I got to meet you.
[03:44:31.819 --> 03:44:33.620]  We're going to eat some barbecue from Terry Black's here in a minute.
[03:44:33.979 --> 03:44:35.360]  I'm starting to mouthwater when you said that.
[03:44:35.479 --> 03:44:35.959]  Oh, I'm starving.
[03:44:36.079 --> 03:44:37.299]  Now, real quick.
[03:44:37.860 --> 03:44:40.100]  This is all done by a computer, by a professional company.
[03:44:40.299 --> 03:44:41.420]  I was talking to you guys before.
[03:44:41.899 --> 03:44:43.319]  Sometimes it's in the middle of it.
[03:44:43.379 --> 03:44:44.159]  Sometimes it's at the end.
[03:44:44.260 --> 03:44:45.159]  Sometimes it's at the start.
[03:44:45.840 --> 03:44:48.379]  Have you seen where somebody who entered on the first day won?
[03:44:48.620 --> 03:44:54.340]  You know, honestly, we've done probably 30 of these giveaways and have never seen someone win on the very first day.
[03:44:54.559 --> 03:45:00.180]  But we have these multipliers that go into place maybe at the first week and the last week of the giveaway, right?
[03:45:00.260 --> 03:45:03.500]  And during these multipliers, if you spend $10, you get 100 entries.
[03:45:03.559 --> 03:45:05.579]  If you spend $100, you get 1,000 entries, right?
[03:45:05.770 --> 03:45:08.270]  It's a 10x multiplier for when you enter during that time period.
[03:45:08.430 --> 03:45:11.110]  You actually entered during the 10x time period, right?
[03:45:11.389 --> 03:45:14.090]  And at the end of the giveaway, we run the 10x time period as well.
[03:45:14.129 --> 03:45:16.629]  So it was one of the best times to enter to win.
[03:45:16.889 --> 03:45:19.690]  And I mean, you got, you know, more entries for how much you spent.
[03:45:19.709 --> 03:45:21.209]  With the new contest, where are we right now?
[03:45:21.329 --> 03:45:24.629]  It's a brand new Ford F-250 Super Duty trimmer.
[03:45:24.770 --> 03:45:25.250]  It's sick.
[03:45:25.350 --> 03:45:26.629]  It's all black, jacked up.
[03:45:26.790 --> 03:45:28.590]  It's Alex Jones verified for sure.
[03:45:28.850 --> 03:45:29.829]  He picked the wheels.
[03:45:29.950 --> 03:45:30.690]  He picked the tires.
[03:45:30.969 --> 03:45:31.690]  It looks good.
[03:45:31.770 --> 03:45:32.069]  I don't know.
[03:45:32.190 --> 03:45:33.209]  Yeah, we're showing it right here.
[03:45:33.610 --> 03:45:36.129]  It also comes with $10,000 in cash as well.
[03:45:36.370 --> 03:45:37.110]  Chris, do you have that on you?
[03:45:37.270 --> 03:45:38.850]  Yeah, this is not a hoax, people.
[03:45:52.059 --> 03:45:53.040]  Somebody can be like Chris.
[03:45:53.139 --> 03:45:54.680]  They can go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:45:54.780 --> 03:45:57.979]  They can order the great CMOS, order any of the great supplements, t-shirts, hats, whatever.
[03:45:58.139 --> 03:46:04.120]  And you're entered to win a badass, brand new F-250 trimmer, fully loaded pickup truck.
[03:46:04.180 --> 03:46:05.500]  And you get $10,000 in cash.
[03:46:05.579 --> 03:46:06.760]  And we fly you down here.
[03:46:06.879 --> 03:46:07.739]  You get to meet Alex.
[03:46:07.819 --> 03:46:08.520]  You get to be on the show.
[03:46:08.659 --> 03:46:11.020]  If you just enter your email, you're still entered to win.
[03:46:11.200 --> 03:46:12.979]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:46:13.120 --> 03:46:13.760]  Enter your email.
[03:46:13.940 --> 03:46:15.100]  Join the VIP club.
[03:46:15.280 --> 03:46:18.479]  I promise you next week what you'll get for being in the VIP club.
[03:46:18.719 --> 03:46:19.760]  You'll be very excited.
[03:46:19.950 --> 03:46:24.309]  I knew folks would love the last truck, and I know you'll love this truck as well.
[03:46:24.489 --> 03:46:30.190]  Another incredible pickup truck, super off-road package, this time from Ford.
[03:46:30.370 --> 03:46:37.190]  It's a beautiful truck, super high ratings, and you get $10,000 in cash on top of it for the lucky winner.
[03:46:37.450 --> 03:46:54.629]  A 2024 Ford F-250 Super Duty Diesel Tremor Edition, 6.7-liter high-output power stroke diesel engine with 500 horsepower and 1,200 pound-feet per torque, 2-inch ready lift kit, 37-inch Toyo off-road tires,
[03:46:55.069 --> 03:47:01.209]  20-inch black Rhino wheels, 12-inch touchscreen with 360-degree cameras to see all around the truck.
[03:47:01.819 --> 03:47:03.120]  Well, it's a kick-ass truck.
[03:47:03.299 --> 03:47:05.500]  I'm sorry to see it go, but it's going to a great guy, Chris.
[03:47:05.639 --> 03:47:06.840]  Chris, love you, brother.
[03:47:07.000 --> 03:47:07.620]  Love you, man.
[03:47:07.680 --> 03:47:07.959]  Thank you.
[03:47:08.360 --> 03:47:10.360]  Somebody's about to get this sweetheart right here.
[03:47:10.879 --> 03:47:13.819]  And listen, they said I could drive it while I was down here for the last month and a half.
[03:47:13.979 --> 03:47:14.780]  Only drove it once.
[03:47:15.159 --> 03:47:16.100]  Things are too nice.
[03:47:16.399 --> 03:47:18.299]  The winners are going to get these pristine trucks.
[03:47:18.780 --> 03:47:21.020]  So, we'll see you at thealexhospore.com, and thanks for all your support.
