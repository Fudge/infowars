[00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.660]  Alright, this is the last update.
[00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.700]  I detailed all this on air today, but I learned even more tonight, and it's worse than I thought.
[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.759]  But here it is, very simply for everybody.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.439]  There was an auction order by the judge, but he wanted to have more hearings about it for the details to make sure it was all legal.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.699]  The U.S. trustee assigned with the Justice Department that was in charge of it went ahead and had what he said was an auction.
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:33.729]  But then it came out that he didn't make the auction public, didn't let people have bids, To go above the supposed highest bid, which means it's not a real auction.
[00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.810]  And then it turns out he ignored the highest bid and gave it to a lower bid because they were the Democrats.
[00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.509]  And so it was a private sale masquerading as an auction that did not happen.
[00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.850]  That's what the judge said today.
[00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.750]  He said it did not go through.
[00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.609]  He's having a full evidentiary hearing next week.
[00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.909]  In the meantime, the U.S. trustee, overstepping his power, came in and closed InfoWars and cut the broadcast off.
[00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.909]  So it is off the air.
[00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.569]  We're over at the Alex Jones Network at AJNLive on X and Real Alex Jones and the satellite up links to the radio stations.
[00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.790]  The TV stations.
[00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:09.689]  They're having to switch over to our new satellite.
[00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.349]  There was some problems there because it was just sneak attack.
[00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.989]  Boom.
[00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.670]  They have the auction.
[00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:15.629]  Keep it secret Wednesday.
[00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.890]  This morning they show up at 8 a.m.
[00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:18.670]  and say, shut the building.
[00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.189]  I go on and, you know, talk about it.
[00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.090]  Then they go order people to shut things off.
[00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.890]  Just saying, I'm a federal trustee.
[00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:25.530]  Do what I say.
[00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.189]  Like the last federal trustee did in June or late May, saying, shut the building with no court order.
[00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:33.819]  I didn't leave.
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.439]  I threatened to call the police.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.519]  And then they had an emergency hearing thinking I would be kicked out and the judge fired them.
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.120]  So this is the second time, second federal trustee doing this wild vigilante crap.
[00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.359]  So the Onion's everywhere announcing they bought it.
[00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.040]  The media is saying they got it.
[00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.140]  But Bloomberg and AP are going, well, now the judge said, no, no, no, he's questioning it.
[00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.659]  No, he said it didn't go through and he's going to decide what to do.
[00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.219]  And my lawyers are like, well, they've taken this thing off the air.
[00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:01.400]  These employees are out on the street.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]  The judge said, well, as soon as we can have it, it's early next week.
[00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:04.620]  I'll give you a date.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.620]  But yeah, this is crazy.
[00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:07.719]  So bring your evidence in.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.139]  But he said, this is unbelievable.
[00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.139]  And he said, this is not an auction.
[00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:13.000]  This is a private sale.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.719]  And this is not what I authorized.
[00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.340]  So that's what's going on, okay?
[00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:17.099]  That's the facts.
