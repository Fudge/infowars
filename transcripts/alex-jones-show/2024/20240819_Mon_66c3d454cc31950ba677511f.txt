[00:00:01.118 --> 00:00:06.900]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:08.181 --> 00:00:12.542]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and support the InfoWars.
[00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:25.507]  It's Monday, August 19th, 2024, and the DNC catastrophe in Chicago has now begun.
[00:00:25.587 --> 00:00:26.788]  Live coverage starts now.
[00:00:30.132 --> 00:00:34.247]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:53.533 --> 00:01:04.216]  Well, we are going to be busy beavers this week covering the DNC that, like everything, the Democrat, Communist, New World Order touches, turns to pure SH-T.
[00:01:05.237 --> 00:01:06.357]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:07.037 --> 00:01:09.338]  Got a lot of reporters and folks will be popping in from the ground.
[00:01:09.358 --> 00:01:13.519]  We have a lot of incredible videos coming in from Benny Johnson and many, many others.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.980]  The insane gaslighting that Trump's way behind is just wild.
[00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:21.181]  JD Vance and others have weighed in on that.
[00:01:21.221 --> 00:01:22.782]  They need to put out campaign ads showing how
[00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.711]  They said he'd lose in 2016 with similar BS.
[00:01:26.312 --> 00:01:29.674]  We have a lot of new Trump campaign ads that are amazing we're going to be airing today.
[00:01:30.274 --> 00:01:35.638]  We have the inventor of mRNA technology on the giant power grab that is Impox or MonkeyBox.
[00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:39.980]  We've got Robert Malone joining us in the third hour.
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.643]  And there has been a huge Harvard-backed, British government-backed study.
[00:01:46.044 --> 00:01:51.548]  This won't be new news to this audience, but major study, COVID shots are sole cause
[00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:57.011]  Of child heart failure surge.
[00:01:58.191 --> 00:01:59.812]  Unbelievable.
[00:01:59.893 --> 00:02:03.955]  And I have a huge stack on mpox and all the fear mongering and everything right here.
[00:02:03.975 --> 00:02:10.799]  We're going to be getting into some of this before Malone gets here and then deeper into it once he joins us.
[00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:22.607]  But in the first half or so of the show, I want to cover news and I want to open the phones up for listeners on election 2024 and all the other big developments, including this one.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.181]  We put it out on X just about 15 minutes ago.
[00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:27.961]  It's already gone viral.
[00:02:29.742 --> 00:02:31.783]  Putin's been saying he'd do this for a while.
[00:02:34.164 --> 00:02:35.544]  And now it's official.
[00:02:37.485 --> 00:02:46.329]  And I talked about this about a month ago, just briefly, but I've been offered asylum in Russia.
[00:02:47.449 --> 00:03:10.078]  And I've had a few other governments reach out, but Putin has now officially said anybody fleeing the New World Order or the satanic left, and he's issuing a list of countries and a decree that's going to come out in about a week and a half on September 1st that will be official, but they put it out on the Putin letterhead and the Russian Foreign Ministry that anyone that wants to flee
[00:03:12.472 --> 00:03:23.056]  And that signs a pledge that they're not a communist or devil worshiper, or they don't want to have sex with children, that they will not try to overthrow Russia, can move to Russia.
[00:03:23.956 --> 00:03:42.063]  So, just as my ancestors on the Mayflower, Protestants on both my father and mother's side, fled to the east coast of what is the United States today, but what was the wilderness then, now, I'm not saying Russia's perfect, far from it, but it's advertising itself as the new America.
[00:03:42.987 --> 00:03:48.192]  That's how far the UK and Europe and the US and Australia and New Zealand and Canada have fallen.
[00:03:48.212 --> 00:03:49.293]  This is just unbelievable.
[00:03:49.593 --> 00:03:55.378]  Putin signs a decree to assist foreigners fleeing neoliberal ideas for traditional Russia.
[00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:57.981]  We'll be reading the decree coming up.
[00:03:58.041 --> 00:04:03.045]  That is just wild that that's how cut and dry this has all gotten.
[00:04:04.386 --> 00:04:06.909]  Here's a copy of the decree for anybody that wants to see it.
[00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:08.930]  I've posted it on RealAlexJones on X.
[00:04:10.106 --> 00:04:18.809]  Russia offers safe haven for people trying to escape Western liberal ideals, which are the opposite of classical liberal.
[00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.331]  Liberal means keep more of your taxes, raise your own children, be able to defend yourself.
[00:04:22.791 --> 00:04:27.093]  Their idea of liberal is a total Borg hive system.
[00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:39.857]  We have the ongoing demonstrations and violence and people taking over stages and 150,000 that are set to protest and it's over 100,000 now starting today.
[00:04:41.278 --> 00:04:44.639]  The main Democrat Party criminals speak Wednesday and Thursday.
[00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:55.261]  We will have live coverage into the wee hours with our great crew and all the great listeners and viewers this Wednesday and Thursday of the devil
[00:04:56.697 --> 00:05:03.684]  All right, we'll be back in 60 seconds when a bunch of stations join us, and we will launch the main transmission.
[00:05:04.244 --> 00:05:10.230]  I'm Alex Jones, calling for all modern Paul Reveres to come to the aid, not just of their country, but of humanity now.
[00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.031]  We are Team Humanity.
[00:05:17.336 --> 00:05:18.157]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:22.133]  America is on the verge of being taken over by a communist.
[00:05:23.054 --> 00:05:24.015]  It's Monday, August 19th, 2024.
[00:05:24.055 --> 00:05:24.876]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:05:42.098 --> 00:05:43.379]  A digital frontier.
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.664]  I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer.
[00:05:50.464 --> 00:05:51.565]  What did they look like?
[00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:52.526]  Ships?
[00:05:52.706 --> 00:05:53.526]  Motorcycles?
[00:05:55.227 --> 00:05:56.909]  Were the circuits like freeways?
[00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.473]  I kept dreaming of the world I thought I'd never see.
[00:06:03.553 --> 00:06:04.914]  And then, one day, I got in.
[00:06:15.268 --> 00:06:30.378]  It is advertised as the God that can deliver us to Valhalla, but all it does is track and trace and control us and cheat us, and steal our identities, and show us back an image of ourselves in a mirror, and then it tells us that it is God.
[00:06:31.653 --> 00:06:32.273]  It is not.
[00:06:32.933 --> 00:06:46.238]  And InfoWars, not even knowing in the last 30 years, particularly in the last 25 since they launched the Google Secret AI project, has infested, invaded the entire AI grid, and that's one reason they're so pissed at us.
[00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:50.540]  And when you speak and you write, you program the AI.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:07:00.163]  That's why they're trying to train the AI only on Wikipedia and Communist New World Order garbage, and trying to wall it off from the public.
[00:07:01.203 --> 00:07:11.685]  That every time they try to turn it loose on the public, we have so much more information we're flooding the zone with, we quote, infect it and take it over.
[00:07:13.345 --> 00:07:16.246]  This is another example of how we are the ghost and the machine.
[00:07:17.026 --> 00:07:18.546]  Or we are the machine and the ghost.
[00:07:19.827 --> 00:07:20.787]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:23.768 --> 00:07:26.548]  Particularly interesting and important news today.
[00:07:26.568 --> 00:07:30.809]  I'm just going to start over here on the left-hand side.
[00:07:34.181 --> 00:07:39.945]  More lies and confusion concerning autopsy of Thomas Crooks, who would be assassin of former President Trump.
[00:07:40.405 --> 00:07:41.826]  Cover up from pillar to post.
[00:07:42.706 --> 00:07:43.247]  Look at this one.
[00:07:44.587 --> 00:07:47.069]  Communism, mass starvation, and the end of America.
[00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:49.450]  Zero hedge.
[00:07:51.151 --> 00:07:51.792]  This one above it.
[00:07:52.952 --> 00:07:56.615]  Eric Schmidt, that's the former Google head, the Pentagon man.
[00:07:56.635 --> 00:08:01.978]  AI think tank urges NATO to monitor disinformation in real time, coordinate responses.
[00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:04.797]  What did I tell you?
[00:08:05.579 --> 00:08:16.396]  Six years ago when the super intense censorship started, it was in the Wall Street Journal in a big article about how I was going to be the main target along with Julian Assange, set the precedent for deplatforming people and unpurchasing them.
[00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:29.703]  And in the article they said that at a NATO meeting in Germany, they said that once they took down Alex Jones and Julian Assange and no one stood up for us, they'd have the president set to take everybody else down.
[00:08:30.364 --> 00:08:38.907]  And now Facebook and other platforms are blocking and censoring the trailer and even advertising for Dennis Quaid's Reagan.
[00:08:41.147 --> 00:08:44.449]  A pretty big-budget, star-studded, looks-amazing film.
[00:08:44.469 --> 00:08:48.511]  In fact, I'm told in my mailbox I've got the Oppressor video.
[00:08:48.531 --> 00:08:49.532]  It comes out on the 30th.
[00:08:51.533 --> 00:08:53.834]  But I've got to get that out of the PO Box.
[00:08:53.934 --> 00:08:55.796]  I know it's there now, and to watch that tonight.
[00:08:55.856 --> 00:08:57.817]  But probably going to get Quaid and some other folks on.
[00:08:57.837 --> 00:08:58.937]  He was on Joe Rogan last week.
[00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:02.099]  But the reason I raise that is, first, it's Alex Jones.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.061]  And six years later, it's a movie with big stars about Ronald Reagan?
[00:09:07.843 --> 00:09:09.123]  They said, well, we're not going to let you do this.
[00:09:09.183 --> 00:09:09.764]  It's political.
[00:09:10.663 --> 00:09:19.508]  So they can flood the zone with all their globalist propaganda and censor us and brainwash our children, control the universities, you name it.
[00:09:20.348 --> 00:09:24.710]  But if you want to make a movie about Ronald Reagan, well that's prosata non grata as well.
[00:09:28.232 --> 00:09:28.892]  Continuing.
[00:09:29.673 --> 00:09:31.414]  Protests begin at the DNC event.
[00:09:32.346 --> 00:09:33.026]  It's been interrupted.
[00:09:33.726 --> 00:09:35.767]  Vance warns about fake polls on Fox.
[00:09:36.387 --> 00:09:41.248]  House concludes Biden actively participated in impeachable offenses.
[00:09:41.648 --> 00:09:42.068]  No kidding.
[00:09:43.688 --> 00:09:59.991]  Now we've got not one, not two, not ten, but dozens of news articles interviewing Tim Walz, the now governor and vice presidential installed candidate of the DNC, saying he's a communist, he's a socialist, we need to be like communist China.
[00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:03.039]  Taking groups of young people there to brainwash him.
[00:10:03.059 --> 00:10:04.360]  He's a communist Chinese agent.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.680]  And I covered some of this last night, but more has broken today.
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:15.882]  And these are incredible screenshots from the microfiche at the libraries of this guy.
[00:10:15.902 --> 00:10:18.222]  So good job researchers ferreting into this guy.
[00:10:19.042 --> 00:10:20.062]  A bunch of crazy talk.
[00:10:21.403 --> 00:10:22.883]  Kamala went off script a few times.
[00:10:23.483 --> 00:10:24.623]  Talked to the press just a little bit.
[00:10:25.303 --> 00:10:27.704]  It was the usual word salad blather.
[00:10:28.697 --> 00:10:29.677]  Got a bunch of clips of that.
[00:10:30.438 --> 00:10:41.603]  In military news, many members of the German Bundestag are saying Ukraine must pay Germany back for damage to the Nord Stream bombing, which they've now been admittedly done.
[00:10:43.304 --> 00:10:47.106]  Turning off the tap, Germany halts all future military aid to Ukraine.
[00:10:47.526 --> 00:10:47.626]  Oh.
[00:10:49.207 --> 00:10:55.690]  Apologize and keep quiet, Polish PM, former deputy head of the EU, tells Germans to shut up about Nord Stream pipeline sabotage.
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.742]  Ukraine pushing Russia to use nuclear bombs, says Belarus president.
[00:11:04.242 --> 00:11:05.483]  That's all pretty interesting.
[00:11:06.544 --> 00:11:07.264]  Pretty dangerous.
[00:11:08.044 --> 00:11:10.566]  Continuing along here, I'm going to get into all this in detail.
[00:11:12.387 --> 00:11:14.528]  In fact, this is one of the first things I want to hit coming up.
[00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:21.111]  Putin signs decree to assist foreigners fleeing neoliberal ideals for traditional Russia.
[00:11:21.151 --> 00:11:23.552]  Guys, I put an ex-post out about 30 minutes ago.
[00:11:23.572 --> 00:11:24.433]  Will you guys print that for me?
[00:11:24.853 --> 00:11:26.454]  I put out my own take on this.
[00:11:27.759 --> 00:11:35.204]  The decree allows such individuals to apply for temporary residence in Russia without needing to meet the usual requirements such as knowledge of the Russian language and history.
[00:11:35.644 --> 00:11:43.089]  Applicants must reject their home country's policies that impose destructive neoliberal ideas contrary to Russian spiritual and moral values.
[00:11:43.109 --> 00:11:51.335]  The Russian government will comply a list of countries promoting these unhealthy attitudes and the foreign ministry will begin issuing visas to such applicants as early as September.
[00:11:52.996 --> 00:11:54.637]  And here is the decree right here.
[00:11:55.916 --> 00:12:00.178]  Russia offers safe haven for people trying to escape Western liberal ideals.
[00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:05.500]  So I'm going to get to that coming up here in just a moment.
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:12.083]  Also, a big giant article that's got ADL, Southern Power Law Center, CIA written all over it.
[00:12:12.243 --> 00:12:24.148]  Inside the secret world of AP3 militias, they basically claim there's about to be giant violent terror attacks all over America as they prep for the false flags.
[00:12:26.223 --> 00:12:42.531]  Then in the third hour, Dr. Robert Malone joins us with the devastating intel on Monkeypox and where it really came from and all the different government war games they did two years ago predicting at this time it would roll out and kill tens of millions of people.
[00:12:43.291 --> 00:12:46.033]  They're now telling you you can catch it easily when that's not even true.
[00:12:46.093 --> 00:12:47.934]  So are they about to release a weaponized version?
[00:12:48.894 --> 00:12:54.517]  We'll talk about it with Dr. Robert Malone coming up and that dovetails with a Harvard British government study
[00:12:55.575 --> 00:12:56.576]  Very prestigious.
[00:12:57.576 --> 00:12:58.257]  All this and more...
[00:13:26.977 --> 00:13:35.044]  Coming up today, Ukraine has destroyed a third bridge in Russia's Kursk region.
[00:13:35.485 --> 00:13:37.507]  Zelensky stresses he'll keep the territory.
[00:13:42.331 --> 00:13:45.534]  Now, I intend to open the phones up.
[00:13:45.674 --> 00:13:46.375]  I'll get the number out.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.001]  Right before we go to break in about 15 minutes, and you're welcome to call in as first-time callers.
[00:13:52.021 --> 00:13:53.002]  We'll give you a chance today.
[00:13:53.762 --> 00:13:54.862]  Only first-time callers, please.
[00:13:55.882 --> 00:14:08.166]  On anything on the election you want to discuss, the DNC, the attempted assassination of Trump, the cover-up, and then socially Vladimir Putin's offer of amnesty or of escape or of
[00:14:12.647 --> 00:14:19.611]  Basically, that you are political asylum, is the word, refugees.
[00:14:20.952 --> 00:14:24.854]  Asylum for political refugees from the West.
[00:14:25.594 --> 00:14:29.357]  So those are the big subjects that I would kindly, politely ask the listeners.
[00:14:29.377 --> 00:14:35.160]  A lot of times we set up a free-for-all, but sometimes I say I specifically want to talk about certain subjects.
[00:14:36.641 --> 00:14:37.081]  And then
[00:14:39.167 --> 00:14:41.829]  Later in the week after Malone's on today, I want to open the phones up.
[00:14:42.409 --> 00:14:43.450]  It's time to do it again.
[00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.632]  Everybody to tell your so-called vaccine story.
[00:14:46.672 --> 00:14:48.794]  It's not really a vaccine.
[00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:54.318]  So this is just a snapshot of what is coming up today.
[00:14:55.899 --> 00:15:00.922]  So let's go ahead now and get into the Russia situation first.
[00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:05.606]  Overhead shot right here, please.
[00:15:06.857 --> 00:15:11.519]  This is from the Russian news agency, Government News press release.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.262]  And it's a copy of the decree that Putin has signed.
[00:15:16.282 --> 00:15:20.184]  The specifics of that will be officially rolled out in early September.
[00:15:20.204 --> 00:15:25.147]  I can tell you this program is already being beta tested and piloted around the world.
[00:15:26.227 --> 00:15:30.669]  Russia offers safe haven for people trying to escape Western liberal ideals.
[00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:31.290]  I'm going to read
[00:15:32.543 --> 00:15:37.146]  The decree here in a moment by Vladimir Putin, but first I want to just remind people what's going on.
[00:15:37.846 --> 00:15:48.612]  Already for at least six, seven years, Germans and Austrians are having their children taken if they won't teach them LGBT pedophile garbage.
[00:15:51.093 --> 00:15:54.255]  If parents don't let the schools brainwash them into Islam, they're taken.
[00:15:55.382 --> 00:16:07.642]  And especially Eastern Germany for a long time obviously took Christian families, children, but since the wall came down and even before under NATO control, Germany has been
[00:16:09.011 --> 00:16:14.052]  Taking the children of Christians and giving them to homosexuals, pedophiles, and others.
[00:16:14.072 --> 00:16:22.134]  There was a giant scandal from the 60s into the 90s that was declassified six years ago that we've covered probably a thousand times.
[00:16:22.994 --> 00:16:29.575]  You can just type in, German government gave children to convicted pedophiles.
[00:16:29.595 --> 00:16:33.056]  30,000 plus children and growing is what they've admitted to, as young as two.
[00:16:33.596 --> 00:16:38.077]  They would give boys to men and girls to women who would then brutally rape them.
[00:16:38.757 --> 00:16:42.900]  And they said the plan by the CIA funding it was to create a new type of family.
[00:16:44.761 --> 00:16:45.942]  A new family structure.
[00:16:47.203 --> 00:16:51.786]  And so Drag Queen Storytime and all of this stuff is about normalizing that.
[00:16:52.307 --> 00:16:53.748]  And again, totally destroying the family.
[00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:57.811]  The dark legacy of sexual liberation in Germany.
[00:16:57.851 --> 00:16:58.351]  DW.
[00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:02.394]  And just type in 30,000 children abused.
[00:17:02.534 --> 00:17:02.754]  There it is.
[00:17:02.794 --> 00:17:06.157]  Germany investigates 30,000 suspects over pedophile network.
[00:17:08.632 --> 00:17:10.133]  And even New Yorker Magazine's reported on it.
[00:17:10.153 --> 00:17:11.775]  When you read into it, it was the government.
[00:17:11.815 --> 00:17:14.677]  German officials placed children with known pedophiles for 30 years.
[00:17:15.898 --> 00:17:16.319]  Right, Bart?
[00:17:18.541 --> 00:17:26.448]  So, I've said I wish, in case America falls completely, which we're very close to, which was a place to run.
[00:17:26.468 --> 00:17:28.630]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:29.590]  The German experiment.
[00:17:29.831 --> 00:17:30.872]  Put up New Yorker Magazine, please.
[00:17:31.372 --> 00:17:34.495]  The German experiment that placed foster children with pedophiles on purpose.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:47.630]  And then they would supply them after training at age two, being raped till age six, they would supply them to satanic orgies carried out at castles, Catholic churches that Satan has taken control of.
[00:17:47.851 --> 00:17:53.196]  That's the total form of Satanism is to do it in the tabernacle, in the church, on the altar.
[00:17:53.796 --> 00:17:56.078]  That's what a Black Mass or Black Sabbath is.
[00:17:56.098 --> 00:17:58.040]  So when you see them,
[00:18:00.558 --> 00:18:18.966]  Different pedophile groups posing as drag queen story time, going out to baseball games and things at the beginning of it and, you know, humping on crosses and peeing on themselves and saying we love Satan and having upside down crosses on them, you know, with their hormone induced male breasts flopping around.
[00:18:19.627 --> 00:18:22.248]  That's an actual classic satanic ritual.
[00:18:23.817 --> 00:18:32.941]  So again, if you're a radio listener and you're hearing all this, my crew, without me even telling them I was going there, just typed in that and just showed you like seven or eight mainstream news articles.
[00:18:33.842 --> 00:18:36.383]  So it's not just that men are now women and compete in women's sports.
[00:18:37.163 --> 00:18:48.269]  The final form of one of these creatures is a ball-headed man, like you saw with a bunch of the government officials, including the doctor that runs the monkey pox program in the White House.
[00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:51.394]  It's for unprotected sex and all the rest of it.
[00:18:51.434 --> 00:18:59.817]  The final form is a man with a fake belly cutting a child out of it and drinking its intestines and blood.
[00:19:02.859 --> 00:19:11.162]  And if you go to any of these or see the videos of these gay pride events, you go there and this is the dominant thing.
[00:19:11.182 --> 00:19:12.663]  People simulating murder to babies.
[00:19:13.043 --> 00:19:15.244]  People defecating and peeing on each other.
[00:19:16.404 --> 00:19:17.805]  Wallowing around in monkey pox.
[00:19:18.942 --> 00:19:23.605]  And it's just a pure degradation of the human soul, pure degeneracy.
[00:19:26.067 --> 00:19:29.089]  And, you know, you do have the gays against groomers, a lot of groups coming out.
[00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:31.951]  And people say, well, you're a hypocrite.
[00:19:31.991 --> 00:19:33.552]  You know, you said you don't hate trans people.
[00:19:33.572 --> 00:19:34.693]  Well, I never have.
[00:19:35.634 --> 00:19:38.075]  I don't hate an adult that has their own life, does their own thing.
[00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:45.541]  But when you push it on children, and then you take the most brutal stuff, people that are into cutting their arms and legs off, it's a big fetish.
[00:19:47.247 --> 00:19:52.129]  There's a big fetish about going and getting an abortion and videotaping it and the women talk about how much they want to kill their children.
[00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:53.790]  I can show you a hundred videos of that.
[00:19:56.090 --> 00:20:01.112]  And they'll write on their stomach before the midterm abortion or late term abortion, you're a little brat.
[00:20:01.132 --> 00:20:02.813]  I'm going to kill you, kill you bastard.
[00:20:03.093 --> 00:20:04.853]  Here's your death day, burn in hell.
[00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:06.514]  I posted that on X last week.
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.261]  I mean, this is pure Satanism.
[00:20:10.681 --> 00:20:25.208]  And if you go to a pro-life event at the Texas Capitol or others, I've been there, Owen's been there, we've got video, you'll see a bunch of women in pantsuits and dresses, like normal-looking women, mainly white women, sticking their tongues out saying, I love Satan, I'm gonna kill babies.
[00:20:25.968 --> 00:20:30.850]  And they'll say they're just doing it to freak out Christians, but no, this is really the mindset that they've adopted.
[00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:32.691]  So, when Russia
[00:20:34.295 --> 00:20:34.575]  We're good.
[00:21:04.679 --> 00:21:08.280]  Or grazed in Butler, Pennsylvania, 40 days ago.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.261]  You see under Obama, open borders and children trafficking exploding.
[00:21:13.721 --> 00:21:15.382]  Then it goes down to almost nothing under Trump.
[00:21:16.902 --> 00:21:19.483]  And then doubles even what Obama was able to do.
[00:21:24.024 --> 00:21:31.766]  In just three and a half years under Biden, you're seeing Hieronymus Bosch, medieval painter of images of hell, on screen of your TV viewer.
[00:21:32.927 --> 00:21:35.327]  So that's what Russia is talking about.
[00:21:35.347 --> 00:21:40.208]  So let me go ahead and read the decree from Russia.
[00:21:40.328 --> 00:21:43.649]  Russia offers safe haven for people trying to escape Western liberal ideals.
[00:21:43.689 --> 00:21:59.332]  Under the document, such foreign nationals will have the right to apply for temporary residence in Russia outside the quota approved by the Russian government and without providing documents confirming their knowledge of the Russian language, Russian history, and basic laws.
[00:22:00.458 --> 00:22:03.960]  Moscow, August 19th, TASS News Agency.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:20.527]  Moscow will provide assistance to any foreigners who want to escape the neoliberal ideals being put forward in their countries and move to Russia, where traditional values reign supreme, according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin.
[00:22:21.485 --> 00:22:36.249]  Under the document such foreign nationals will have the right to apply for temporary residence in Russia outside the quota approved by the Russian government and without providing documents confirming their knowledge of the Russian language, Russian history and basic laws.
[00:22:36.929 --> 00:22:48.512]  Applicants may be based on the rejection of their country's policies aimed at imposing destructive neoliberal ideals on people which run counter to traditional Russian spiritual and moral values.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:54.262]  The values are listed in the foundations of Russian state policy in this field.
[00:22:54.782 --> 00:23:07.547]  While the Russian government is expected to compile a list of countries imposing unhealthy attitudes on their citizens, the Foreign Ministry has been instructed to start issuing three-month visas to such applicants as early as in September.
[00:23:08.147 --> 00:23:12.589]  In February, Putin supported the idea of Italian student Irene
[00:23:14.142 --> 00:23:14.943]  So short and sweet, there it goes.
[00:23:14.963 --> 00:23:15.443]  Look at this headline.
[00:23:36.087 --> 00:23:36.768]  From LifeSite.
[00:23:37.208 --> 00:23:45.075]  The UN and EU are targeting Bulgaria for moving to protect children from LGBTQIAPS2+.
[00:23:48.138 --> 00:23:48.438]  P2S+.
[00:23:49.099 --> 00:23:49.559]  What a cult.
[00:23:52.362 --> 00:23:52.702]  Shock!
[00:23:52.802 --> 00:23:55.865]  Pride Charity Founder Arrested on Child Sex Charges.
[00:23:56.245 --> 00:23:58.587]  Just every time, they're... That's what they do, man.
[00:23:58.607 --> 00:24:00.589]  I mean, these folks...
[00:24:02.665 --> 00:24:03.285]  Mean business.
[00:24:03.305 --> 00:24:04.726]  This is a pedophile cult.
[00:24:04.827 --> 00:24:06.247]  And they are strong and they are growing.
[00:24:06.828 --> 00:24:09.129]  And they are infiltrating our governments, education, everything.
[00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:12.852]  So this is a big, big deal.
[00:24:14.773 --> 00:24:17.415]  And of course, Ukraine is pushing all this stuff inside Ukraine.
[00:24:17.875 --> 00:24:22.659]  Ukraine destroys three bridges in Russia's Kursk region.
[00:24:23.179 --> 00:24:26.401]  Zelensky stresses he'll keep the territory and NATO backs it.
[00:24:28.202 --> 00:24:31.765]  Ukraine must pay Germany back for damages from Nord Stream bombing.
[00:24:34.226 --> 00:24:34.867]  Says lawmaker.
[00:24:36.328 --> 00:24:39.411]  Turning off the tap, Germany halts all future military aid to Ukraine.
[00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:44.315]  So, this coming out about Ukraine blowing up the Nord Stream Pipeline was really U.S.
[00:24:44.335 --> 00:24:44.655]  government.
[00:24:46.597 --> 00:24:50.100]  Cy Hirsch has the receipts, the sources, you know, he's always been proven deadly accurate.
[00:24:51.481 --> 00:24:52.402]  And he's been totally vindicated.
[00:24:52.422 --> 00:24:55.685]  So now they're trying to fall back and say, oh no, it's not us, it's six people in a sailboat.
[00:24:57.006 --> 00:24:57.607]  They did it all.
[00:24:59.189 --> 00:25:04.794]  I'm surprised they didn't claim that Santa Claus did it, or maybe the Easter money.
[00:25:04.814 --> 00:25:07.656]  All right, let me give out the toll-free number.
[00:25:07.676 --> 00:25:07.896]  It's 877-789-2539.
[00:25:07.916 --> 00:25:07.956]  877-789-2539.
[00:25:07.976 --> 00:25:09.978]  There it is right there on screen.
[00:25:09.998 --> 00:25:10.118]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:25:10.138 --> 00:25:13.561]  We're taking first-time callers' calls here today.
[00:25:27.282 --> 00:25:30.963]  And we have limited crew, but they're a group of badasses.
[00:25:32.363 --> 00:25:35.564]  And so to do this, some of them will have to work, most of them work 18 hours a day.
[00:25:36.224 --> 00:25:44.286]  We're talking about just doing Wednesday and Thursday with Governor Walz, Pelosi, Bill Clinton, Booty Juice, and Kamala Harris.
[00:25:44.986 --> 00:25:49.507]  But man, we got Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Hillary Clinton tonight.
[00:25:51.937 --> 00:25:55.939]  We've got Obama, Big Mike, and others, and J.D.
[00:25:55.959 --> 00:25:59.080]  Pritzker, the transgender pervert king.
[00:26:00.861 --> 00:26:04.403]  So, looks like we'll probably just cover all four nights here.
[00:26:04.423 --> 00:26:09.706]  I just don't want to give the crew a mission where it's that exhausting, but they're tough.
[00:26:11.246 --> 00:26:11.567]  We're on it.
[00:26:11.587 --> 00:26:12.087]  The crew wants it.
[00:26:12.427 --> 00:26:18.050]  Their mission they've accepted, because we've only got like... What is it?
[00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.810]  Eight?
[00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.370]  Eight?
[00:26:19.811 --> 00:26:20.331]  Eight or nine?
[00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:32.234]  Production crew now for the live shows we can call in some of the editors and people to come help like Rob do and McBrain and all hands on deck and I'll I'll be up here.
[00:26:34.055 --> 00:26:36.776]  So stuck with me, haha.
[00:26:37.656 --> 00:26:43.198]  And of course, we'll be chasing Harrison and Owen, but we'll rotate through the nights together.
[00:26:43.218 --> 00:26:47.500]  Please remember it takes money to do this and we had extra money.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.160]  We'd have more crew.
[00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:53.644]  The last CRO fired a lot of our people trying to shut us down, but now we've stabilized the company through the year.
[00:26:53.664 --> 00:26:55.325]  There's a good chance we're going to survive.

[00:29:15.213 --> 00:29:18.594]  77 days left to the most important election in world history.
[00:29:18.634 --> 00:29:22.376]  Then there's 79 days of hell once Trump's president-elect.
[00:29:23.757 --> 00:29:24.277]  Woo!
[00:29:24.377 --> 00:29:25.638]  What an exciting time.
[00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:28.471]  To be alive.
[00:29:28.491 --> 00:29:38.438]  All right, I want to play some clips that are important and then go to your calls and we'll intersperse other major news that I have in front of me and as it breaks here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:39.418 --> 00:29:42.260]  But JD Vance made a really great point.
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:46.343]  He made several great points about don't believe these fake polls.
[00:29:48.124 --> 00:29:49.145]  Republicans aren't doing
[00:29:50.356 --> 00:30:00.083]  These psychological polls, because I've been looking at their polls, they're not going out the methodology and trying to have Trump way ahead of what he is to create the illusion that he's invincible.
[00:30:00.103 --> 00:30:01.183]  They're doing real polls.
[00:30:02.284 --> 00:30:08.728]  The Democrats are just, as usual, putting out total frauds to create the illusion that, oh, she's neck and neck.
[00:30:08.828 --> 00:30:09.709]  Oh, she's way ahead.
[00:30:09.789 --> 00:30:11.090]  Oh, she has so much enthusiasm.
[00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:12.731]  Oh, her crowds are so huge.
[00:30:13.972 --> 00:30:18.355]  And then meanwhile, she drives into Chicago from the airport and there's all these Trump people lining the streets booing her.
[00:30:19.994 --> 00:30:23.677]  And then you've got 150,000 people set to demonstrate starting now against her.
[00:30:24.397 --> 00:30:29.301]  Their own party's people don't think they're communist or islamicist or pedophile enough.
[00:30:30.482 --> 00:30:33.043]  So this is a three-ring circus.
[00:30:33.063 --> 00:30:33.864]  So here's J.D.
[00:30:33.904 --> 00:30:37.647]  Vance on the polls, and then we'll play a clip of J.D.
[00:30:37.687 --> 00:30:40.589]  Vance on Kamala Harris being over the border.
[00:30:41.229 --> 00:30:45.032]  It's like putting Jeffrey Epstein over it.
[00:30:45.092 --> 00:30:48.555]  Well, yeah, I mean, that's the same group, so it actually is the same people.
[00:30:48.595 --> 00:30:48.875]  Here it is.
[00:30:49.753 --> 00:30:52.236]  Let me just say one final point on this, Shannon, because I think it's important.
[00:30:52.636 --> 00:31:04.348]  Consistently, what you've seen in 2016 and 2020 is that the media uses fake polls to drive down Republican turnout and to create dissension and conflict with Republican voters.
[00:31:04.728 --> 00:31:10.394]  I'm telling you, every single person who's watching this, the Trump campaign is in a very, very good spot.
[00:31:10.634 --> 00:31:13.057]  We're going to win this race, we just have to run through the finish line.
[00:31:13.277 --> 00:31:26.802]  Because the American people just don't buy the idea that Kamala Harris, who has been vice president for three and a half years, is somehow going to tackle the inflation crisis in a way tomorrow that she hasn't for the past 1,300 days.
[00:31:27.242 --> 00:31:33.864]  Giving Kamala Harris control over inflation policy, Shannon, it's like giving Jeffrey Epstein control over human trafficking policy.
[00:31:34.144 --> 00:31:36.305]  The American people are much smarter than that.
[00:31:36.565 --> 00:31:39.726]  They don't buy the idea that Kamala Harris represents a fresh start.
[00:31:40.106 --> 00:31:41.307]  She is more of the same.
[00:31:41.427 --> 00:31:51.991]  It is doubling down on the failed policies of the Harris administration to give Kamala Harris a promotion rather than defy her, which is what I think most Americans are going to do on November.
[00:31:52.891 --> 00:31:54.131]  So that's a double-edged sword.
[00:31:54.672 --> 00:32:00.474]  He's talking about giving her control over the economy.
[00:32:00.494 --> 00:32:03.155]  It's like giving Jeffrey Epstein, you know, control of children.
[00:32:04.158 --> 00:32:08.239]  But they're the DNC that used him for the blackmail and control.
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.200]  So it cuts both ways.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:16.462]  I mean, no matter how horrible you say something about her, even if you mean it as an analogy, even the analogy is true.
[00:32:17.543 --> 00:32:18.603]  Just absolutely incredible.
[00:32:21.924 --> 00:32:23.185]  Let's go to this next clip here.
[00:32:24.545 --> 00:32:25.586]  Clip 15.
[00:32:26.206 --> 00:32:29.167]  Palestinian protester rushes the stage at DNC.
[00:32:29.207 --> 00:32:30.147]  This is just this morning.
[00:32:30.407 --> 00:32:31.808]  This is going to be happening everywhere.
[00:32:35.247 --> 00:32:42.972]  Now here is Whitmer, who is the co-chair of the campaign, Total Globalist.
[00:33:05.219 --> 00:33:10.960]  They want to replace Kamala with her somewhere down the road because she works directly inside the deep state and is so evil.
[00:33:11.921 --> 00:33:14.801]  Here she is saying, oh, everybody agrees.
[00:33:14.861 --> 00:33:22.103]  Americans resonate with giving illegal aliens driver's license, free health care, free education, free housing, just free everything.
[00:33:23.203 --> 00:33:24.284]  But citizens don't get that.
[00:33:24.324 --> 00:33:25.264]  Plus, you couldn't pay for that.
[00:33:26.064 --> 00:33:28.825]  It's about bringing in those new voters that are totally dependent.
[00:33:28.845 --> 00:33:29.305]  They control.
[00:33:29.365 --> 00:33:29.745]  Here she is.
[00:33:31.172 --> 00:33:37.456]  Well, let me ask you about her running mate, Tim Walz, and particularly on the issue of immigration.
[00:33:37.536 --> 00:33:41.499]  Obviously, some of his policies in his state have come into focus.
[00:33:41.539 --> 00:33:56.309]  He signed into law initiatives allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for driver's licenses, quality for free tuition at public universities, and enroll in the state's free health care program for low-income residents.
[00:33:56.629 --> 00:34:00.892]  Would you like to see the Harris administration adopt those same policies, Governor?
[00:34:02.975 --> 00:34:05.537]  Well, I can tell you, you know, Tim Walz is a pragmatic guy.
[00:34:05.637 --> 00:34:14.885]  He's a Midwesterner, just like me, and I think some of the wonderful things he's done in Minnesota resonate with, you know, Americans in all states.
[00:34:16.286 --> 00:34:17.487]  Oh yeah, it really resonates.
[00:34:17.607 --> 00:34:23.151]  In every major poll out there, over 80 percent, some are as high as 92, most are about 87, 85.
[00:34:23.872 --> 00:34:28.115]  People are totally against, including Democrats, something like 67 percent is the last number I saw.
[00:34:29.396 --> 00:34:32.399]  Over 90 percent of Republicans are against giving illegal aliens everything free.
[00:34:34.002 --> 00:34:34.943]  Probably even higher than that.
[00:34:34.983 --> 00:34:36.084]  I mean, who is for that?
[00:34:36.104 --> 00:34:37.224]  I guess illegal aliens.
[00:34:37.985 --> 00:34:39.746]  I guess that's the 15-20% that are for it.
[00:34:40.807 --> 00:34:42.348]  They're already probably that much of the population.
[00:34:43.029 --> 00:34:44.630]  This is how you conquer a country.
[00:34:45.131 --> 00:34:46.091]  Rome did it by accident.
[00:34:46.111 --> 00:34:46.912]  Took a few hundred years.
[00:34:46.932 --> 00:34:48.994]  This is happening overnight in America.
[00:34:49.574 --> 00:34:53.657]  And of course, Harris wants to ban your guns and make you turn them in.
[00:34:53.897 --> 00:34:54.378]  Here she is.
[00:34:56.081 --> 00:35:06.816]  I support buybacks and I think that we have 5 million assault weapons on the streets of America and we have 5 million assault weapons on the streets of America.
[00:35:07.737 --> 00:35:09.279]  And assault weapons have been designed
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.201]  How mandatory is your gun buyback program?
[00:35:12.401 --> 00:35:13.141]  It's mandatory.
[00:35:13.161 --> 00:35:13.682]  Second Amendment?
[00:35:13.722 --> 00:35:14.722]  Second Amendment?
[00:35:14.742 --> 00:35:17.924]  Listen, we have to... We're gonna have to do it the right way.
[00:35:17.964 --> 00:35:19.185]  There's no question about that.
[00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:43.974]  We don't have any, we have to get these guns off the street.
[00:35:44.774 --> 00:35:55.961]  But I also, you know, I have faith in the American people to know that, you know, that we want to comply with our laws and that I know that to be true.
[00:35:57.041 --> 00:35:58.242]  I mean, what does that even mean?
[00:36:00.263 --> 00:36:10.309]  Yes, most of the mass shootings that are still very rare but are terrible, they use an AR-15 because that's advertised and these patsies go out and do this and a lot of this stuff obviously is being provocateured.
[00:36:12.779 --> 00:36:13.480]  Wind up toys.
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:17.444]  But the government has guns.
[00:36:17.484 --> 00:36:18.525]  The government has these AR-15s.
[00:36:18.605 --> 00:36:20.407]  It's not about duck hunting.
[00:36:20.427 --> 00:36:21.928]  It's not about deer hunting.
[00:36:22.669 --> 00:36:23.770]  And she wants your guns.
[00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:34.501]  Make no mistake, because they want a monopoly of power just like Venezuela, or the old Soviet Union, or North Korea, or Cuba, or Communist China, or Vietnam, or Cambodia.
[00:36:38.837 --> 00:36:42.900]  Giffords Group commits $15 million to boost Kamala Harris and gun safety candidates.
[00:36:43.901 --> 00:36:45.362]  They mean monopoly of power.
[00:36:45.862 --> 00:36:58.052]  The UN said back in 2000 that there must be a monopoly of power and that civilian ownership of guns must be eliminated.
[00:36:58.632 --> 00:37:00.814]  For there to be a monopoly of power of the global government.
[00:37:02.415 --> 00:37:05.317]  They are on record saying that that is their policy.
[00:37:05.978 --> 00:37:07.159]  That that is their plan.
[00:37:08.049 --> 00:37:09.130]  That that is their program.
[00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:12.892]  And the good news is they lie about most stuff, but they're open about open borders.
[00:37:12.933 --> 00:37:14.213]  They're open about wanting your guns.
[00:37:15.755 --> 00:37:28.224]  And now they want to steal the election again because they're a dying political party that has no excitement and almost no supporters other than government workers and mainly illegal aliens and old white women.
[00:37:28.824 --> 00:37:29.424]  And that's a fact.
[00:37:29.444 --> 00:37:36.710]  You look at the video or you look at the demographics of the voters and you go look at a Harris-Waltz pervert campaign event.
[00:37:37.697 --> 00:37:40.398]  And it's about 80% old white women.
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.961]  And they think the state's their god.
[00:37:44.981 --> 00:37:46.281]  They think it's really there to help them.
[00:37:48.222 --> 00:37:49.503]  It's very, very, very, very sad.
[00:37:50.384 --> 00:37:52.325]  But that's what this has come down to.
[00:37:54.125 --> 00:37:57.847]  Harrison Walsh went into a convenience store.
[00:37:59.348 --> 00:38:00.629]  And this is cringeworthy.
[00:38:00.669 --> 00:38:01.169]  Here's the clip.
[00:38:07.592 --> 00:38:13.715]  Oh look, they're regular people.
[00:38:13.755 --> 00:38:15.716]  They eat Doritos just like we do.
[00:38:38.482 --> 00:38:40.744]  Alexander Soros a couple weeks ago put a tweet out about Walsing.
[00:38:41.064 --> 00:38:41.785]  Great choice.
[00:38:42.425 --> 00:38:45.548]  He's a football coach and regular people like football coaches.
[00:38:45.568 --> 00:38:46.749]  He sounds like a space alien.
[00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:49.451]  But humans like football.
[00:38:50.292 --> 00:38:51.793]  We all simply say we like football.
[00:38:53.735 --> 00:38:55.736]  I remember Chuckie Schumer and I cook a hamburger.
[00:38:58.359 --> 00:39:00.020]  Pocahontas, Senator.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.802]  The thing where she goes, I like beer.
[00:39:02.862 --> 00:39:03.443]  Here's a beer.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:09.744]  And she takes the bottle opener and just touches it and falls right off.
[00:39:09.764 --> 00:39:10.925]  It was already open for her.
[00:39:11.525 --> 00:39:12.005]  Who are they?
[00:39:12.085 --> 00:39:13.627]  I mean, maybe they are space aliens.
[00:39:13.647 --> 00:39:17.930]  I mean, I don't literally believe that, but something's wrong with these people.
[00:39:18.931 --> 00:39:19.211]  All right.
[00:39:20.412 --> 00:39:22.673]  Let me show you some of the headlines as they spin things.
[00:39:24.155 --> 00:39:28.698]  Trump misses Biden and doesn't have the heart for a second battle with Harris.
[00:39:29.459 --> 00:39:30.279]  Trump's everywhere.
[00:39:30.319 --> 00:39:33.642]  Trump has more energy than all the top Democrats combined.
[00:39:37.179 --> 00:39:38.540]  But they just keep gaslighting.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:39.880]  Continuing.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.261]  Democrat National Convention.
[00:39:41.301 --> 00:39:46.604]  What to expect during a week of political stars protesting Kamala Harris' big moment.
[00:39:48.144 --> 00:39:56.408]  As she was installed and didn't get one vote, and Biden had a medical emergency and they removed him, that is a coup by every definition.
[00:39:56.748 --> 00:39:59.990]  A group inside the government, not elected, removes the nominee.
[00:40:05.023 --> 00:40:08.264]  Oh, but they're criticizing Trump saying he's making it up that she was installed.
[00:40:09.785 --> 00:40:14.347]  With false coup claims, Trump primes supporters to challenge a Harris win.
[00:40:14.807 --> 00:40:17.728]  No, he's pointing out that legally and lawfully it's illegal.
[00:40:18.649 --> 00:40:20.090]  The Washington Post says it's normal.
[00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:22.751]  Oh, look, it's a party.
[00:40:22.811 --> 00:40:24.651]  Obama, Biden, and Harris.
[00:40:25.132 --> 00:40:28.673]  Meanwhile, Biden's gonna leave after the first day and is all pissed off and admits he is.
[00:40:30.254 --> 00:40:32.415]  Because they took him out politically behind the shed and shot him.
[00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:37.773]  Kamala Harris, Democrats ride momentum at the National Convention in Chicago.
[00:40:38.674 --> 00:40:40.115]  Yeah, ooh, a lot of momentum.
[00:40:40.916 --> 00:40:43.017]  People look really excited in that gas station.
[00:40:43.037 --> 00:40:46.780]  They don't even let regular people in there, as much as their politicos in there.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.901]  Convention delegates.
[00:40:48.542 --> 00:40:50.063]  But look, oh look, they're in a gas station.
[00:40:50.083 --> 00:40:50.643]  They're normal.
[00:40:50.944 --> 00:40:51.584]  They're buying Doritos.
[00:40:53.615 --> 00:40:55.916]  Convention delegates will nominate Harris again this time.
[00:40:56.176 --> 00:40:58.818]  There's less suspense and more pizzazz.
[00:40:59.218 --> 00:41:00.619]  It's a virtual event.
[00:41:01.059 --> 00:41:03.941]  They're letting 10,000 paid media in as the crowd.
[00:41:03.981 --> 00:41:04.541]  That's admitted.
[00:41:05.562 --> 00:41:06.282]  And no one else.
[00:41:06.742 --> 00:41:13.646]  Political operatives, paid media that have signed non-disclosures, no real people, with 150,000 protesters outside.
[00:41:15.007 --> 00:41:15.827]  And she's installed.
[00:41:16.087 --> 00:41:17.188]  But Trump's crazy.
[00:41:18.248 --> 00:41:18.949]  This isn't a coup.
[00:41:20.805 --> 00:41:25.147]  Oh, there's less suspense because she's already installed, but more pizazz!
[00:41:27.568 --> 00:41:29.569]  Michelle Obama to address Democrat convention.
[00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:34.431]  She's officially talking Thursday, but I guess she's popping in Tuesday as well.
[00:41:36.372 --> 00:41:40.494]  Chicago gets ready for prime time as national TV networks converge on DC.
[00:41:40.534 --> 00:41:41.655]  Ooh, the prime time.
[00:41:42.195 --> 00:41:43.216]  Almost no one watching it.
[00:41:44.616 --> 00:41:49.939]  You know, X-Feed sitting here making fun of them and covering their lies will have more views than their channels.
[00:41:51.101 --> 00:41:52.942]  I mean, they do live feeds, got like 50 viewers.
[00:41:53.242 --> 00:41:54.543]  Their bigger one's 100, maybe 1,000.
[00:41:54.983 --> 00:41:57.905]  Surprise!
[00:41:57.945 --> 00:42:02.667]  DNC security measures crop up along Magmile, other parts of downtown.
[00:42:02.707 --> 00:42:03.928]  Oh, they're locking more of it down.
[00:42:05.649 --> 00:42:10.571]  Protesters plan large marches and rallies as Democrat National Convention kicks off in Chicago.
[00:42:11.452 --> 00:42:15.434]  As DNC hits Chicago, Microsoft warns of deepfake artificial intelligence attacks.
[00:42:17.455 --> 00:42:19.356]  You know, the fraudulent attacks of Microsoft.
[00:42:20.421 --> 00:42:21.902]  Remember, they are who knocked half the country out.
[00:42:22.562 --> 00:42:23.883]  Half the world out a few weeks ago.
[00:42:25.584 --> 00:42:29.886]  New CNN Road to 270 shows multiple pathways to victory for both Harris and Trump.
[00:42:32.167 --> 00:42:35.089]  Harris downplays gender in a shift in strategy from Clinton.
[00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.089]  2016.
[00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:38.111]  Alright, I'm gonna stop there.
[00:42:38.151 --> 00:42:39.011]  Go to your phone calls.
[00:42:41.572 --> 00:42:44.914]  Then, interspersed with all this, I've only covered about 10% of the news.
[00:42:46.275 --> 00:42:47.996]  And I see I'm getting more print-offs.
[00:42:48.016 --> 00:42:49.577]  They're bringing me more breaking stuff right now.
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:56.926]  Coming up, House concludes Biden actually participated in impeachable offenses.
[00:42:59.149 --> 00:43:05.917]  Eric Schmidt, AI of Google, think tank, urges NATO to monitor disinformation in real time, coordinate responses.
[00:43:06.929 --> 00:43:08.871]  And what have we been hearing from their other spokespersons?
[00:43:08.931 --> 00:43:15.617]  We want NATO and we want UN in the streets of countries that don't take the shots in the new lockdowns.
[00:43:15.677 --> 00:43:16.798]  That's word per word.
[00:43:17.479 --> 00:43:21.823]  They're actually test ballooning foreign troops in America.
[00:43:22.223 --> 00:43:23.184]  We have the video.
[00:43:24.085 --> 00:43:24.926]  I didn't see it on my list.
[00:43:24.966 --> 00:43:25.526]  Maybe it's there.
[00:43:25.566 --> 00:43:27.688]  Get me the Schmidt, new Schmidt video.
[00:43:27.708 --> 00:43:38.997]  There was other video of him last week saying he's an arms dealer now and just now got into it because of the Russians and is creating combat killer robots already in the field because he loves you and he's liberal when he's always been involved in that.
[00:43:40.018 --> 00:43:42.320]  That's all coming up today.
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:52.429]  All right, we got Don, Tim, Terry, Candace, Maynard, Zachary, Josh, Margo, Dante, Jacob,
[00:43:53.373 --> 00:43:55.233]  We're going to take these calls in order they're received.
[00:43:55.654 --> 00:43:57.234]  Let's talk to folks in Texas first.
[00:43:57.374 --> 00:43:58.294]  Tim, you're on the air.
[00:44:00.015 --> 00:44:00.615]  Hello, Alex.
[00:44:00.735 --> 00:44:01.515]  Can you hear me okay?
[00:44:01.555 --> 00:44:02.135]  I can, brother.
[00:44:03.176 --> 00:44:03.916]  I'm in Texas.
[00:44:03.956 --> 00:44:04.436]  Thank you, man.
[00:44:04.476 --> 00:44:10.938]  You woke me up in 2008 with the Aaron Russo interview, and I've been red-pilling people ever since, so thank you so much for that.
[00:44:11.138 --> 00:44:11.538]  Thank you.
[00:44:12.178 --> 00:44:16.279]  My son actually worked for you and sold ads for you back when you had an ad team.
[00:44:16.659 --> 00:44:17.439]  Boy, that's work.
[00:44:17.999 --> 00:44:19.820]  And he loved you, by the way.
[00:44:20.413 --> 00:44:20.974]  Thank you, brother.
[00:44:33.186 --> 00:44:33.587]  I don't know.
[00:44:52.788 --> 00:44:52.988]  Yes.
[00:45:14.609 --> 00:45:19.933]  And it just seems like they could pull that trigger any time they wanted.
[00:45:20.014 --> 00:45:22.235]  So they can turn these people loose.
[00:45:22.255 --> 00:45:33.164]  And it looks to me like what they're planning is to get enough chaos going and get us begging to give away all of our freedom so that they'll give us their version of our security, right?
[00:45:33.644 --> 00:45:35.346]  And I don't understand
[00:45:35.979 --> 00:45:39.505]  What's holding them up and that kind of involved in that?
[00:45:39.585 --> 00:45:41.588]  Is Trump just a big accident?
[00:45:42.089 --> 00:45:43.111]  Who's helping Trump?
[00:45:43.311 --> 00:45:45.635]  I mean, does he have military help?
[00:45:45.675 --> 00:45:47.398]  Does he have foreign nation support?
[00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:50.503]  But it just doesn't seem why it seems to me like
[00:45:51.092 --> 00:45:54.133]  They're holding all the cards when they turn these people loose.
[00:45:54.233 --> 00:45:55.913]  Oh, sir, sir, sir, sir, listen.
[00:45:56.453 --> 00:45:57.894]  The globals control the corporate media.
[00:45:57.934 --> 00:45:59.454]  They control almost all the big banks.
[00:46:00.014 --> 00:46:01.414]  They control the top of the military.
[00:46:01.474 --> 00:46:03.555]  Trump has support from the middle down.
[00:46:04.295 --> 00:46:05.735]  But the globals are the people in position.
[00:46:06.156 --> 00:46:12.037]  But all over the world, people are trying to elect populist or they're firing whoever the incumbents are, where they be controlled right wing or left wing.
[00:46:12.958 --> 00:46:14.821]  And so this is a global political realignment.
[00:46:14.861 --> 00:46:17.446]  Trump is not perfect, but he really was the president.
[00:46:17.727 --> 00:46:19.090]  He really tried to fix things.
[00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:20.833]  He really believes in what he's doing.
[00:46:20.873 --> 00:46:21.634]  He means well.
[00:46:22.135 --> 00:46:23.177]  And that's why they hate him.
[00:46:24.426 --> 00:46:31.335]  So it's the populist and the decentralized against the centralized and against big tech.
[00:46:32.036 --> 00:46:34.760]  And so, yeah, that's why the... Right, right.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.443]  It's nationalism versus globalism, right?
[00:46:37.663 --> 00:46:40.247]  It's patriots versus one world government.
[00:46:40.267 --> 00:46:42.209]  But that's why the Q thing was so dangerous.
[00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:43.650]  Yeah, I had the same thing going on.
[00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:47.012]  I was telling my friend, nobody's going to get in trouble, nobody's going to go to jail.
[00:47:07.939 --> 00:47:12.841]  And only people will be in trouble is Trump people, and now, eight years later, that's pretty much all that's happening.
[00:47:13.181 --> 00:47:16.183]  Exactly, but I mean, look at the assassination attempt.
[00:47:16.963 --> 00:47:28.548]  Cover up day one, no press conferences, total evidence of stand down, the deputy head of the Secret Service ran the operation, stand down, lying to Congress, Fauci not getting in trouble, all because they control the bureaucracy.
[00:47:29.946 --> 00:47:30.706]  People hate them.
[00:47:32.207 --> 00:47:35.368]  I mean, Trump's really 20 points ahead, 30 points ahead, depending on the area.
[00:47:35.969 --> 00:47:39.330]  So all they have is the illusion that we're not the majority now.
[00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:40.531]  But I go out on the street.
[00:47:40.731 --> 00:47:41.191]  I'm known.
[00:47:41.751 --> 00:47:43.572]  All I get is 99% love now.
[00:47:43.992 --> 00:47:46.253]  And I was getting 90% love five, six years ago.
[00:47:46.313 --> 00:47:47.974]  So they're done, folks.
[00:47:47.994 --> 00:47:49.855]  That could be the most liberal area, conservative area.
[00:47:50.195 --> 00:47:50.995]  People are awake.
[00:47:51.115 --> 00:47:51.635]  They're pissed.
[00:47:51.676 --> 00:47:52.416]  They know what's going on.
[00:47:52.456 --> 00:47:53.296]  God bless you for the call.
[00:47:54.097 --> 00:47:54.437]  All right.
[00:47:54.777 --> 00:47:55.897]  Thanks for calling in.
[00:47:55.937 --> 00:47:56.898]  Let's talk to Kansas.
[00:47:58.649 --> 00:48:03.432]  I just combined her name, Candace, and Texas as another name.
[00:48:03.972 --> 00:48:05.433]  Candace in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:48:05.473 --> 00:48:05.753]  Go ahead.
[00:48:06.714 --> 00:48:07.454]  What's up, Alex?
[00:48:07.514 --> 00:48:08.354]  Thanks for having me.
[00:48:08.394 --> 00:48:09.215]  Can you hear me okay?
[00:48:09.255 --> 00:48:09.415]  I can.
[00:48:09.455 --> 00:48:09.735]  Go ahead.
[00:48:10.656 --> 00:48:10.936]  All right.
[00:48:10.976 --> 00:48:14.638]  Well, first of all, first-time caller, big lover of your work.
[00:48:14.718 --> 00:48:16.439]  Thank you so much for everything that you do.
[00:48:17.019 --> 00:48:17.379]  Thank you.
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.921]  I have to tell you, so I'm in my mid-30s.
[00:48:21.941 --> 00:48:24.363]  I live in Texas, ex-Democrat.
[00:48:25.809 --> 00:48:30.274]  Um, I got up this morning reading the news and I was really distraught with some of the stuff that was coming out.
[00:48:30.734 --> 00:48:37.061]  And I felt the need to write a tweet and put it on X. So if you want, um, or if I can, can I read it?
[00:48:37.081 --> 00:48:38.782]  It'll take me maybe about 60 seconds.
[00:48:38.803 --> 00:48:41.025]  Yeah, listen, I don't really scream people's calls on air.
[00:48:41.085 --> 00:48:44.568]  So when you hear that on the phone system, that means you're on air.
[00:48:44.929 --> 00:48:45.489]  I'm not mad at you.
[00:48:45.509 --> 00:48:46.911]  It's for everybody else.
[00:48:47.331 --> 00:48:48.613]  You don't have to ask, are you here?
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.901]  Because you're speaking.
[00:48:51.622 --> 00:48:55.144]  And then, if you want to cover something, just say, hey, I wrote this tweet today.
[00:48:55.164 --> 00:48:55.845]  I want you to hear it.
[00:48:56.145 --> 00:48:56.706]  And just say it.
[00:48:56.726 --> 00:49:00.349]  Because, see, this is not like regular talk radio where we screen your calls before.
[00:49:00.369 --> 00:49:01.610]  We just make sure you have a clean line.
[00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:03.711]  And if you want to tell us what you're calling about, that's fine.
[00:49:04.132 --> 00:49:05.893]  And then we just want you to talk once you get on air.
[00:49:05.933 --> 00:49:07.214]  I'm not going to screen your call on air.
[00:49:07.234 --> 00:49:07.834]  Does that make sense?
[00:49:08.595 --> 00:49:09.356]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:49:09.436 --> 00:49:10.937]  OK, so let me just read this really quick.
[00:49:10.977 --> 00:49:12.678]  Or if you want to share it, you can.
[00:49:12.798 --> 00:49:13.559]  You can follow me.
[00:49:13.599 --> 00:49:15.540]  I'm at btvastro.
[00:49:17.062 --> 00:49:18.283]  So this is my tweet.
[00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:20.891]  This is my tweet for you.
[00:49:22.491 --> 00:49:23.492]  So let me get this straight.
[00:49:23.572 --> 00:49:33.996]  So Biden has committed treason since he was VP, essentially by accepting foreign business deals from lining his pockets with cash from adversaries who influence our leadership.
[00:49:34.657 --> 00:49:40.259]  If you think about it, it's a total of 11 years per the recent investigation as of this morning from the House.
[00:49:41.179 --> 00:49:44.621]  So he had his entire family in on it, like millions of dollars accepted.
[00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:48.073]  He's been dealing with dementia for at least the last year, admittingly.
[00:49:48.493 --> 00:49:50.014]  Could have been going on longer than we know.
[00:49:50.775 --> 00:49:55.680]  His handlers and his entire staff knew, as well as the Democrats, but most importantly Kamala Harris.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:03.126]  Kamala's apparently dealing with a serious addiction problem and is being kept from the press strategically because of her inability to stay on script.
[00:50:03.927 --> 00:50:07.571]  Her entire staff knows and claims that she's been unable to manage this addiction.
[00:50:08.311 --> 00:50:11.054]  Some are questioning her ability to serve as a presidential candidate.
[00:50:12.051 --> 00:50:21.357]  Critics are now slamming involvement of Planned Parenthood, and Palestinian protesters are promoting having abortions and vasectomies because it helps protect Palestinian rights and sovereignty.
[00:50:21.998 --> 00:50:34.766]  They're offering these services like candy just blocks away, commemorating the Democratic Convention with celebratory abortions because you're with her, because having an abortion is associated with supporting a female candidate in this election.
[00:50:35.547 --> 00:50:39.149]  Essentially, these protesters are celebrating eugenics like it's a badge of honor.
[00:50:40.023 --> 00:50:43.784]  All of this news comes out mere days before the Democratic National Convention.
[00:50:44.744 --> 00:50:49.665]  The convention in Chicago is calling for walls and barriers to be put up to keep out angry protesters.
[00:50:50.425 --> 00:50:53.745]  Yet they now want valid ID to gain access to the convention.
[00:50:53.945 --> 00:50:54.526]  The irony.
[00:50:55.486 --> 00:50:59.886]  For a party that runs on joy, it would seem as if this is anything but that at the moment.
[00:51:00.507 --> 00:51:04.267]  This has become the party of hate, contradictions, and dishonesty.
[00:51:04.867 --> 00:51:06.248]  What an absolute disgrace.
[00:51:06.988 --> 00:51:08.748]  How can anyone get behind any of this?
[00:51:09.574 --> 00:51:10.757]  What is the world come to?
[00:51:11.379 --> 00:51:12.461]  None of this is normal.
[00:51:13.063 --> 00:51:15.409]  People have become so desensitized, it's frightening.
[00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:18.938]  And if you're not condemning this right now, then you're not on the right side of history.
[00:51:21.209 --> 00:51:24.171]  Excellent point, and more people need to write like you did on X. I'm glad.
[00:51:24.532 --> 00:51:28.174]  If listeners want to call in with a brief written statement, that's always welcome.
[00:51:28.194 --> 00:51:30.036]  We just want to hear what you have to say.
[00:51:30.056 --> 00:51:32.337]  And remember Pelosi reviewing the troops at the Capitol?
[00:51:32.618 --> 00:51:34.679]  Remember all the fences around that for six months?
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:39.543]  They want permanent martial law, and they live behind walls, but we can't have our own border.
[00:51:39.923 --> 00:51:41.985]  That is total fraud and total hypocrisy.
[00:51:42.245 --> 00:51:43.286]  Thank you, Candace, for the call.
[00:51:44.264 --> 00:51:44.564]  All right.
[00:51:44.584 --> 00:51:51.568]  We're only a minute and a half out to break, starting the next hour, but I'm going to come right back and go to Margo and everybody else in the order your calls received.
[00:51:51.588 --> 00:51:56.611]  877-789-2539 is the number to join us.
[00:51:56.671 --> 00:52:00.713]  Again, this is the Alex Jones Show, Monday, August 19th, 2024.
[00:52:00.913 --> 00:52:10.158]  We will have live coverage tonight, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of the DNC debacle in Chicago.
[00:52:11.718 --> 00:52:14.599]  Please remember, ladies and gentlemen, we can't do this without you.
[00:52:14.679 --> 00:52:15.860]  You are the Paul Reveres.

[00:52:35.668 --> 00:52:36.929]  You've got all the power.
[00:52:38.154 --> 00:52:39.535]  They are planning civil unrest.
[00:52:39.555 --> 00:52:40.715]  They are planning a civil war.
[00:52:40.755 --> 00:52:41.635]  They admit they are.
[00:52:42.076 --> 00:52:42.936]  They are communists.
[00:52:42.956 --> 00:52:43.916]  They are totalitarians.
[00:52:43.936 --> 00:52:45.457]  They are on the Chinese Communist payroll.
[00:52:45.957 --> 00:52:46.937]  This is really happening.
[00:52:47.778 --> 00:52:49.738]  But we can stop it together.
[00:52:50.219 --> 00:52:53.160]  This is the real battle for our country.
[00:52:54.423 --> 00:52:55.764]  And the world right now.
[00:52:55.884 --> 00:52:57.945]  I cannot stress to you how serious this is.
[00:52:57.965 --> 00:53:01.886]  So please support our sponsor, DRJonesNaturals.com.

[00:53:52.998 --> 00:54:08.027]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking, some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[00:54:08.388 --> 00:54:10.249]  We had five companies making product for us.
[00:54:10.869 --> 00:54:15.352]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're InfoWars.
[00:54:16.067 --> 00:54:21.748]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[00:54:21.768 --> 00:54:24.629]  Not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[00:54:25.449 --> 00:54:38.872]  And they said, listen, you know we were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label
[00:54:40.154 --> 00:54:44.197]  On our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[00:54:44.597 --> 00:54:48.019]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup.
[00:54:48.039 --> 00:54:54.703]  And I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling our products and a lot of the products that we developed.
[00:54:55.384 --> 00:55:03.249]  But so many of these products that they had put out, again, were the exact same thing that we were putting out.
[00:55:04.241 --> 00:55:12.344]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private labeled from them before we're even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[00:55:12.424 --> 00:55:19.046]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, it's so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood.
[00:55:19.206 --> 00:55:21.707]  Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[00:55:21.867 --> 00:55:23.788]  Our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[00:55:23.988 --> 00:55:33.777]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[00:55:34.397 --> 00:55:36.800]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:37.901]  Take Turmeric 95.
[00:55:39.582 --> 00:55:46.304]  Turmeric 95 is called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[00:55:46.404 --> 00:55:52.086]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[00:55:52.166 --> 00:56:00.689]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsTour.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[00:56:00.749 --> 00:56:02.830]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line.
[00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:03.170]  And
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:17.723]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[00:56:18.224 --> 00:56:22.605]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[00:56:22.665 --> 00:56:27.306]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[00:56:28.347 --> 00:56:33.570]  So I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:34.271]  It's amazing.
[00:56:34.411 --> 00:56:35.331]  It's super high quality.
[00:56:35.411 --> 00:56:37.253]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[00:56:57.566 --> 00:56:58.046]  Thank you.
[00:57:38.473 --> 00:57:40.894]  I can feel freedom rising across the planet.
[00:57:46.697 --> 00:57:48.637]  I can feel human liberty exploding.
[00:57:49.538 --> 00:57:51.539]  I can feel your will.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:57.601]  Evil is in full panic mode right now.
[00:57:59.222 --> 00:58:00.183]  God is real.
[00:58:00.923 --> 00:58:01.783]  God is great.
[00:58:01.843 --> 00:58:05.645]  God is the compendium of the entire universe and beyond.
[00:58:09.241 --> 00:58:10.342]  I want all of you to hear me now.
[00:58:12.323 --> 00:58:18.608]  The tectonic developments, culturally, spiritually, economically, has just begun.
[00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:31.777]  And it is your choice, spiritually, now, which side you're going to be on that will predestine your entire future throughout the universe.
[00:58:32.918 --> 00:58:34.419]  Earth is only the launch point.
[00:58:36.076 --> 00:58:37.277]  The eye has not seen.
[00:58:37.297 --> 00:58:40.278]  The ear has not heard.
[00:58:40.298 --> 00:58:44.840]  The mind has not conceived what God has in store for us.
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:47.281]  You can feel it.
[00:58:47.721 --> 00:58:48.781]  You can see it.
[00:58:48.821 --> 00:58:50.042]  You can touch it.
[00:58:50.062 --> 00:58:50.842]  You can taste it.
[00:58:51.422 --> 00:58:53.263]  You know it in your very bones.
[00:58:53.983 --> 00:58:55.064]  The heart of your soul.
[00:58:56.972 --> 00:59:01.336]  Reach out to God and ask God to lead, guide, and direct you.
[00:59:02.256 --> 00:59:03.617]  Ask God to sanctify you.
[00:59:04.558 --> 00:59:05.779]  Ask God to purify you.
[00:59:06.359 --> 00:59:09.562]  Reach out across the time-space continuum.
[00:59:10.242 --> 00:59:19.089]  Make the electrical connection to infinity and transcend Satan, the failed little G-God of this world.
[00:59:21.711 --> 00:59:26.515]  We are living in such an incredibly historical time right now.
[00:59:27.515 --> 00:59:31.881]  Yes, these are the times that try men's souls.
[00:59:32.842 --> 00:59:40.731]  But it is the trying of the soul that makes us face reality and become what we really should be.
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:59.104]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:59.164 --> 01:00:00.546]  F-O-O-R!
[01:00:00.606 --> 01:00:01.086]  F-O-O-R!
[01:00:01.146 --> 01:00:02.247]  F-O-O-R!
[01:00:38.203 --> 01:00:44.826]  Where do you stand on defund the police?
[01:00:45.066 --> 01:00:49.608]  We need to take a look at these budgets and figure out whether it reflects the right priorities.
[01:00:49.768 --> 01:00:57.672]  It is outdated, it is wrong-headed thinking to think that the only way you're gonna get communities to be safe is to put more police officers on the street.
[01:00:57.732 --> 01:01:00.854]  We have to reimagine how we achieve public safety.
[01:01:00.894 --> 01:01:03.575]  Part of this has to be about upending the system.
[01:01:03.775 --> 01:01:13.207]  Politicians were successful in moving away critical funds to police stations and now what we are seeing across the country is violence surging.
[01:01:13.267 --> 01:01:19.655]  Cities across the country are seeing a major spike in violent crime now while cities are pushing to defund the police nationwide.
[01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:21.077]  We choose freedom.
[01:01:31.661 --> 01:01:38.044]  All right, folks, we're gonna go to break and join over 300 radio stations in just a few seconds, and then I'm gonna come right back to your phone calls.
[01:01:38.104 --> 01:01:38.724]  I'm gonna move quick.
[01:01:39.264 --> 01:01:51.790]  Already had some great callers last hour, but I want to get everybody on live before Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA technology, joins us with what he believes, and he's a smart cookie, what's coming down with this new global pandemic.
[01:01:52.847 --> 01:01:53.448]  And the UN.
[01:01:54.349 --> 01:01:59.797]  This is so important coming up in the third hour, and your calls are vital and important as well.
[01:02:00.478 --> 01:02:02.641]  So please remember the power you have, Paul Revere!
[01:02:03.709 --> 01:02:06.470]  You have the power of your destiny and the future in your hands.
[01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:08.351]  Share this transmission now.
[01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:10.832]  The weapon of truth against the globalist lies.
[01:02:11.312 --> 01:02:13.112]  The sword of truth is in your hands.
[01:02:13.593 --> 01:02:16.214]  Now it's your mission should you choose to accept it.
[01:02:16.594 --> 01:02:17.954]  Take action now.
[01:02:18.354 --> 01:02:23.236]  Share the live links, articles and videos now and follow us on X at RealAlexJones.
[01:02:23.996 --> 01:02:28.198]  We are now into hour number two and I'm going directly to your phone calls in one moment.
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:42.103]  And then as the horrid videos of the Democrat Party scurvy boil in, like monkey pox, we're going to be playing it for you.
[01:02:42.143 --> 01:02:49.504]  We have marchers saying, kill babies, cut your genitals off, free abortions, vasectomy trucks.
[01:02:51.885 --> 01:02:56.025]  We just have, you know, jihadis running around screaming death to America.
[01:02:56.626 --> 01:02:58.426]  And that's the Democrat Party constituents.
[01:02:59.892 --> 01:03:11.777]  And then we have little jewels like this that I'm gonna ask, I can't do it right now, ask the crew to repost this, and I would say this is part of the Democrat Party's official platform.
[01:03:12.057 --> 01:03:14.098]  That's what I would post this on X, you're about to see.
[01:03:15.659 --> 01:03:17.600]  This is what the Democrat Party leadership's been calling for.
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:24.543]  And that dovetails with this, and the Jamie Raskin clip, and all the rest of it.
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:31.841]  In fact, maybe I should wait on this till the bottom of the hour and get the Raskin clip and a bunch of others.
[01:03:31.861 --> 01:03:32.882]  I have to remember them.
[01:03:32.902 --> 01:03:34.282]  There's like 10 of them in the last month.
[01:03:35.082 --> 01:03:38.563]  Democrats calling for re-education camps, mass arrests of Republicans.
[01:03:39.463 --> 01:03:46.165]  They've got their pandemic centers as the cover for, oh, the contact tracing said you might be sick.
[01:03:46.405 --> 01:03:47.845]  That's why the neighbor disappeared.
[01:03:48.886 --> 01:03:50.206]  I mean, and you've got
[01:03:51.604 --> 01:03:56.625]  Hotez, get that clip too, who's the official W.E.F.
[01:03:57.286 --> 01:03:57.566]  U.N.
[01:03:57.586 --> 01:04:02.567]  spokesperson of the W.H.O., said we need to use NATO and U.N.
[01:04:02.587 --> 01:04:07.328]  troops to enforce lockdowns in America and to shut them down informationally.
[01:04:07.669 --> 01:04:11.210]  And now you've got Eric Schmidt right at the top of the Pentagon's A.I.
[01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:12.090]  weapon program.
[01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:15.691]  He left Google five, six years ago to go do this.
[01:04:16.641 --> 01:04:18.861]  He comes out and says, oh, I just got into this.
[01:04:18.941 --> 01:04:19.562]  I'm an arms dealer.
[01:04:19.582 --> 01:04:22.362]  We're going to have robots everywhere to protect you from invading Russians.
[01:04:23.702 --> 01:04:25.283]  Oh dear, the Russians are coming.
[01:04:25.543 --> 01:04:27.403]  I have to put combat robots everywhere around you.
[01:04:27.543 --> 01:04:28.603]  They're not for you, though.
[01:04:28.663 --> 01:04:29.963]  They're to keep you safe.
[01:04:30.704 --> 01:04:36.885]  Eric Schmidt's AI think tank urges NATO to monitor disinformation in real time, coordinate responses.
[01:04:38.345 --> 01:04:40.745]  Yeah, I'm going to hit this by the hour, because here's the new piece of news.
[01:04:41.986 --> 01:04:43.286]  I'll post it on X right now, though.
[01:04:44.082 --> 01:04:52.427]  Liberals argue for re-education camps for Republicans at DNC bodies outside of Unjust Law March in Chicago.
[01:04:53.607 --> 01:05:02.872]  Liberals argue for re-education camps for Republicans at DNC bodies outside of Unjust Law March in Chicago.
[01:05:02.953 --> 01:05:04.373]  That's just the weird names they have.
[01:05:06.875 --> 01:05:10.957]  So, and they're running around saying we're going to put you in camps.
[01:05:11.037 --> 01:05:12.538]  I mean, this is what these
[01:05:14.171 --> 01:05:15.191]  Lunatics, one.
[01:05:16.552 --> 01:05:18.853]  But then they're like, Trump's going to put us all in camps.
[01:05:19.313 --> 01:05:20.633]  Trump's going to mass arrest us.
[01:05:20.653 --> 01:05:22.874]  We've got Kamala Harris, all of them, on TV.
[01:05:23.014 --> 01:05:24.195]  Oh, he's going to build camps.
[01:05:24.235 --> 01:05:25.535]  He's going to put everybody in jail.
[01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:26.895]  He's going to have martial law.
[01:05:27.116 --> 01:05:28.976]  And they're the ones that just appointed a candidate.
[01:05:29.176 --> 01:05:31.057]  They're the ones that just removed Biden.
[01:05:32.878 --> 01:05:35.558]  Got Jamie Raskin calling for civil war.
[01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:38.459]  You mean just keep listing people in the last few weeks?
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:42.601]  Raskin, Schmidt, Hotez, the list goes on and on.
[01:05:45.376 --> 01:06:04.487]  And I saw it out there again, somebody pulled it out of the stack, that blue report, the National Security Report, June 2001, where Biden says, the number one threat is the white supremacists, and we define white supremacists as anyone that doesn't want lockdowns, open borders, or who's against forced injection.
[01:06:04.507 --> 01:06:06.888]  I think I'm gonna start doing their voices, Marvin the Martian.
[01:06:07.729 --> 01:06:12.492]  Oh, you pesky earth creature, my strontium-12 detonator will destroy the earth.
[01:06:13.746 --> 01:06:15.247]  Well, they just want to destroy all human life.
[01:06:15.267 --> 01:06:19.588]  I mean, these people are a maniac, mad scientist, cuckoo cult.
[01:06:20.688 --> 01:06:24.670]  Oh yeah, Biden said that if Trump wins, there won't be a peaceful transfer of power.
[01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:26.771]  I'm going to keep just thinking of these clips here.
[01:06:27.691 --> 01:06:28.531]  How many more do you want?
[01:06:30.432 --> 01:06:31.212]  Get me those clips.
[01:06:32.913 --> 01:06:33.373]  Biden.
[01:06:33.933 --> 01:06:34.553]  We got to stop there.
[01:06:34.633 --> 01:06:38.915]  I can play you Bill Mudd saying they're going to kill Trump, CIA.
[01:06:39.555 --> 01:06:39.735]  No.
[01:06:41.536 --> 01:06:41.896]  Biden.
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:50.883]  I mean, Raskin Hotels, and now Eric Schmidt.
[01:06:50.923 --> 01:06:51.463]  Get his video.
[01:06:52.764 --> 01:06:54.064]  So, you starting to figure this out?
[01:06:55.185 --> 01:06:55.945]  Think you are now, huh?
[01:06:57.946 --> 01:07:00.427]  Everything they say we're going to do, they're going to do.
[01:07:01.447 --> 01:07:02.888]  But until then, let's go to your calls.
[01:07:04.068 --> 01:07:05.189]  Margo in Florida.
[01:07:05.229 --> 01:07:06.109]  Margo, you're on the air.
[01:07:06.149 --> 01:07:06.469]  Welcome.
[01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:08.590]  Hello, my friend.
[01:07:09.451 --> 01:07:10.971]  What a blessing to talk to you today.
[01:07:11.071 --> 01:07:11.312]  Thank you.
[01:07:11.332 --> 01:07:12.192]  And I want to tell you that
[01:07:12.785 --> 01:07:18.590]  I pray for you and your staff for your safety and that you put on the armor of God every single day.
[01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:19.171]  Truly.
[01:07:19.191 --> 01:07:21.012]  I'm trying.
[01:07:21.453 --> 01:07:21.893]  I'm trying.
[01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:22.514]  You're absolutely right.
[01:07:23.575 --> 01:07:24.435]  And we're praying for you.
[01:07:24.495 --> 01:07:24.796]  Truly.
[01:07:24.856 --> 01:07:29.119]  My family and my friends and all that down in South Florida in Palm Beach I'm from.
[01:07:29.139 --> 01:07:37.687]  So I want to tell you in 2020 I was diagnosed with progressive multiple sclerosis and I've been taking your nerve renewal
[01:07:38.579 --> 01:07:43.802]  And for my trigeminal neuralgia and your tumor at 95 had truly kept me in remission.
[01:07:43.842 --> 01:07:45.143]  So I want to thank you for that.
[01:07:46.084 --> 01:07:51.207]  It saved me and it's keeping me, that it's not progressing anymore.
[01:07:51.247 --> 01:07:52.007]  So thank you for that.
[01:07:52.027 --> 01:07:52.487]  Well, thank you.
[01:07:52.507 --> 01:07:54.388]  Let me just tell you why all this stuff is so incredible.
[01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:59.772]  We don't eat really good, even myself, because I'm so adulterated.
[01:08:00.432 --> 01:08:03.094]  The soils have the proper minerals and things in them and cofactors.
[01:08:04.105 --> 01:08:15.716]  And so most people, even if you try, are not getting the essential minerals and cofactors, and a lot of things like the iodine that's in the environment is bound to other elements, so you don't absorb it.
[01:08:16.016 --> 01:08:25.225]  So we go out and look at what already the top supplements are, already the best ratings, already the best reviews, already the best science, and we private label it, we come up with our own, and make it better.
[01:08:25.666 --> 01:08:27.307]  So all of this is a missing link.
[01:08:27.327 --> 01:08:28.548]  Just type into a search engine,
[01:08:29.389 --> 01:08:31.109]  Global iodine deficiency.
[01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:41.392]  And you'll see all these UN and British Medical Journal reports about two plus billion people have cognitive disability from lack of iodine.
[01:08:42.012 --> 01:08:46.653]  Okay, so just that little thing, again, essential means without it you die.
[01:08:47.093 --> 01:08:48.993]  Might take you six months to die without any iodine.
[01:08:49.534 --> 01:08:55.555]  Take you four minutes without oxygen, it'll take you about four or five days without water, 30 days on average without food.
[01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:56.815]  What does food have?
[01:08:56.835 --> 01:08:57.756]  It has vitamins and minerals.
[01:08:57.776 --> 01:09:03.918]  But if the food itself doesn't have it, you get lots of calories and get fat, but you don't get the actual nutrients.
[01:09:03.938 --> 01:09:12.582]  So everything we sell, whether it's CBD oil or whether it is nitric boost, whatever it is, it's damn real.
[01:09:13.202 --> 01:09:14.242]  And it damn works.
[01:09:14.803 --> 01:09:17.284]  And the globalists are taking all this stuff as well.
[01:09:17.684 --> 01:09:18.904]  They don't want the public to know about it.
[01:09:18.944 --> 01:09:19.885]  So thank you for the support.
[01:09:19.905 --> 01:09:24.947]  But that's why you heard a caller earlier about he had serious mental stuff because of
[01:09:25.967 --> 01:09:26.427]  I don't know.
[01:09:41.517 --> 01:09:44.600]  And when he started talking about iodine, I'm like, wait, it's been two weeks since I took it.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:45.941]  I should be taking it every couple days.
[01:09:46.121 --> 01:09:48.223]  And I had my bottle right here, sort of slurping it.
[01:09:49.104 --> 01:09:51.606]  Because when I don't take it, I feel it, I see it.
[01:09:51.887 --> 01:09:57.392]  And I remember Dr. Group, when he told me about this 12 years ago, he said, this stuff we're coming out with, that's pure atomic iodine.
[01:09:57.412 --> 01:09:58.933]  He goes, you got sunspots on your face.
[01:09:59.413 --> 01:10:00.294]  And I was like, 38 then.
[01:10:00.334 --> 01:10:00.555]  I'm 50 now.
[01:10:02.416 --> 01:10:06.499]  And he goes, he goes, you take this, and he goes, in most cases, the sunspots go away.
[01:10:06.719 --> 01:10:11.423]  And you can look at videos, I mean, 12 years ago, and you could see sunspots all over my face.
[01:10:11.703 --> 01:10:12.884]  Folks, they ain't there.
[01:10:13.345 --> 01:10:16.827]  I mean, I've got some scars that have turned browner, you know, and stuff that I already had.
[01:10:16.867 --> 01:10:19.789]  So the scars are still there.
[01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:23.252]  But I mean, the sunspots are 98% gone.
[01:10:23.572 --> 01:10:25.354]  And I was kind of rolling my eyes at him.
[01:10:25.894 --> 01:10:28.657]  I mean, I respected him, but I still didn't understand how serious it was.
[01:10:28.677 --> 01:10:30.680]  So I'm going to X2, X3, get him.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:31.761]  Thank you for the plug.
[01:10:31.801 --> 01:10:32.522]  Now, what's on your mind?
[01:10:33.643 --> 01:10:37.247]  And I want to say that Dr. Judy Mikevich, she is in my phone.
[01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:38.609]  I can call her anytime.
[01:10:39.009 --> 01:10:44.595]  And she's the one that told me to go to your supplement, to get the turmeric, to get the
[01:10:45.518 --> 01:10:47.320]  The nerve renew.
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:49.902]  So I thank her, too, because she adores you.
[01:10:50.002 --> 01:10:50.682]  Oh, yeah.
[01:10:50.722 --> 01:10:51.703]  We don't pay her to say that.
[01:10:51.763 --> 01:10:53.484]  She just loves our formulas.
[01:10:53.524 --> 01:10:54.906]  So she's an awesome person.
[01:10:55.126 --> 01:10:56.107]  She's a famous scientist.
[01:10:57.187 --> 01:11:00.570]  And I'm blessed that she tells me I can call her anytime.
[01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:02.952]  So thank you, Judy, if you're listening.
[01:11:02.972 --> 01:11:03.432]  She's awesome.
[01:11:03.833 --> 01:11:13.981]  So I want to tell you that I'm with Defend Florida, which is a very large group of attorneys and people that are fighting for election integrity.
[01:11:14.765 --> 01:11:24.328]  And I mean, in 2020, just in Florida, people don't realize we had over 1 million irregularities, dead voters and fake ballots.
[01:11:24.748 --> 01:11:28.249]  And, you know, it's very sad just because we may be red.
[01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:30.189]  We got big problems here.
[01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:33.570]  You know, we're being overtaken by illegal criminals.
[01:11:34.210 --> 01:11:35.190]  I have a business.
[01:11:36.631 --> 01:11:39.212]  And two weeks ago, I was broken into.
[01:11:41.443 --> 01:11:45.185]  These people are desperate, and we are needing to fight back.
[01:11:45.445 --> 01:11:50.167]  I don't know what's going to happen on November 3rd.
[01:11:50.387 --> 01:11:50.927]  I really don't.
[01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:57.270]  But there are 350,000 now people organized by Trump, hundreds of thousands organized by others.
[01:11:57.630 --> 01:11:59.190]  That's really scaring the deep state.
[01:11:59.230 --> 01:11:59.731]  They're scared.
[01:12:00.011 --> 01:12:01.271]  That's why they tried to kill him.
[01:12:01.491 --> 01:12:04.993]  Folks, if their fix was unstoppable, they wouldn't have tried to blow Trump's head off.
[01:12:06.699 --> 01:12:08.200]  And so, you know, 100%.
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:21.747]  And we have a group here, which is the Club 47th, and every Tuesday meet-up, once a month, we have, you know, Michael Flynn, we've got, you know, Michael Young, Ann Vander Stil, they all come and they speak with us.
[01:12:21.907 --> 01:12:24.308]  And we fight back, and we are going to fight back.
[01:12:24.588 --> 01:12:30.671]  But the problem is we still have dominion voting systems here in Florida, and I don't see that changing.
[01:12:30.711 --> 01:12:35.614]  And I don't see DeSantis, who's compromised, I can say, fighting against that.
[01:12:36.215 --> 01:12:40.118]  You know, so I'm a little nervous because I know... No, we should be.
[01:12:40.358 --> 01:12:41.779]  We should be nervous, Margo.
[01:12:41.799 --> 01:12:43.521]  A hundred percent.
[01:12:43.721 --> 01:12:45.282]  And I just wanted to say that.
[01:12:45.302 --> 01:12:49.345]  And I want to thank you and your staff and Owen, I love, and you.
[01:12:49.586 --> 01:13:00.674]  And every morning I go in my store and I don't care if anybody thinks that I'm very bold about my faith and I'm bold about what I believe and put you on my TVs in my store.
[01:13:01.155 --> 01:13:05.358]  And there's people that sit there while I'm doing things in the back in my, you know, what I do for a living.
[01:13:05.971 --> 01:13:11.794]  And they will sit there and watch you and look to me and go, what is this?
[01:13:12.514 --> 01:13:14.335]  Well, you've been lied to.
[01:13:14.355 --> 01:13:15.355]  This is the truth.
[01:13:15.395 --> 01:13:16.155]  That's what this is.
[01:13:16.896 --> 01:13:23.279]  And they will come into my store just to sit there so that I can pray for them or, you know, you know, it's all about.
[01:13:23.559 --> 01:13:26.500]  You're creating, you're creating real community.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:27.020]  Beautiful.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:27.880]  God bless you.
[01:13:27.981 --> 01:13:28.621]  Thank you so much.
[01:13:29.437 --> 01:13:29.817]  Amazing.
[01:13:30.558 --> 01:13:34.359]  All right, let's move quick, because I said I'm going to move quick, but then these callers are great, so I'm going to talk to them forever.
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:36.441]  Dante in California.
[01:13:36.481 --> 01:13:37.041]  Thanks for calling.
[01:13:37.061 --> 01:13:37.701]  Go ahead, Dante.
[01:13:38.662 --> 01:13:39.422]  Hey, Alex.
[01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:41.443]  Oh, man, I'm a huge fan.
[01:13:41.523 --> 01:13:43.744]  First time call in.
[01:13:45.605 --> 01:13:48.787]  First of all, I just wanted to say I have a signed copy of The Great Awakening.
[01:13:48.807 --> 01:13:51.268]  It was a Christmas gift from a friend last Christmas.
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:55.922]  Yeah, so I'll just start by saying a little bit about me.
[01:13:56.742 --> 01:14:01.746]  I learned it at a very early age, and I'm very thankful for this, to question everything.
[01:14:01.786 --> 01:14:07.210]  It was actually an AP World History teacher that I had in high school.
[01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:15.536]  He showed a news article about a protest in Israel, and the newspaper clipping had a picture
[01:14:16.366 --> 01:14:16.747]  I'm good.
[01:14:28.519 --> 01:14:35.803]  You know, a lot of people said, obviously the person with the baton and then he gave the backstory and said, well, actually that soldier was protecting the exchange student.
[01:14:35.823 --> 01:14:37.805]  He was an exchange student from actually Florida.
[01:14:38.485 --> 01:14:43.448]  Um, and so he said, uh, you know, he taught us just, you know, question everything.
[01:14:43.648 --> 01:14:47.791]  And since then I've gotten really into the, you know, all kinds of different things.
[01:14:47.851 --> 01:14:48.831]  I love the paranormal.
[01:14:48.871 --> 01:14:51.433]  I love like, you know, unexplained phenomenon.
[01:14:51.833 --> 01:14:54.635]  But, um, so obviously I, I'm,
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:06.044]  I'm a huge fan of your work and your very simple message of just questioning everything, fighting people.
[01:15:07.124 --> 01:15:08.725]  And this is why I kind of wanted to call in.
[01:15:08.745 --> 01:15:14.947]  This was the big picture of kind of my philosophical thoughts about the current situation in the country.
[01:15:16.207 --> 01:15:23.070]  I think it's really dangerous to... If you do your due diligence and you arrive at a party, that's one thing.
[01:15:23.942 --> 01:15:31.150]  When you hear people going, come over to our side, and this is both sides, I have to say, come over to our side.
[01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:32.311]  Those guys are horrible.
[01:15:33.127 --> 01:15:43.877]  And then the rhetoric starts to get really, really, and both sides do this, and they hijack our wanting for a tribe or a group.
[01:15:44.377 --> 01:15:51.684]  But that's from, you know, evolutionarily, that's from our survival instinct to survive things that were non-human.
[01:15:51.804 --> 01:15:58.350]  You know, we'd group together as humans and, you know, fight things that were going to harm us.
[01:15:59.472 --> 01:15:59.793]  I'm good.
[01:16:13.974 --> 01:16:15.356]  It's good to question things.
[01:16:15.997 --> 01:16:21.183]  You can find good in both sides of this political divide.
[01:16:21.684 --> 01:16:29.874]  I do have to say, I think one side is much worse than the other right now, but that has to do with the organizational leadership roles that you talked
[01:16:30.594 --> 01:16:32.856]  Sure, well the system uses divide and conquer.
[01:16:32.876 --> 01:16:36.159]  And if you were back 20 years ago, the Republican Party was just as bad as the Democrats.
[01:16:36.579 --> 01:16:41.503]  But there's a beachhead of populism, and it tends to be right-wing that turns things around around the world.
[01:16:42.123 --> 01:16:43.705]  And so we are tribal creatures.
[01:16:43.745 --> 01:16:44.926]  We have to realize it's tribal.
[01:16:45.546 --> 01:16:45.966]  Hey Alex, God bless.
[01:16:45.986 --> 01:16:46.887]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:16:46.907 --> 01:16:47.147]  Thank you.
[01:17:08.952 --> 01:17:11.073]  Hey, I want to talk about the election real quick.
[01:17:11.134 --> 01:17:19.559]  Tucker Carlson said something a few months ago that really stayed with me, and it's like looking at it through a shower curtain.
[01:17:19.579 --> 01:17:20.479]  Look at the election.
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:28.264]  We know there's something going on, but can't put your finger right on it exactly what they're going to do, but we know there's something.
[01:17:29.445 --> 01:17:37.130]  And it seems like they're trying to demoralize the country by putting the stupidest people at the forefront.
[01:17:37.628 --> 01:17:39.870]  I'm listening to you, brother.
[01:17:39.930 --> 01:17:40.130]  And I.
[01:18:04.722 --> 01:18:07.424]  I, you know, am I, is it crazy to think that?
[01:18:07.464 --> 01:18:14.330]  Like, I know that there's no way that they're just going to let him walk right back in there and turn this whole ship around.
[01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:23.057]  I mean, this has been a plan for so long, and they've, you know, for the most part, they've been successful other than, you know, killing him a few weeks ago.
[01:18:23.598 --> 01:18:28.082]  Well, let me respond to what you said, and I appreciate your call because your phone's got some audio problems, but you made some really good points.
[01:18:32.074 --> 01:18:43.482]  Ian Bloomberg articles and Financial Times of London articles, and that's just a few I'm mentioning, going back 20 years ago, 15, you know, I mean, I've probably seen a thousand of these articles, okay?
[01:18:43.502 --> 01:18:45.303]  I'm just throwing out a few that I remember.
[01:18:46.824 --> 01:18:52.988]  There was one Bloomberg article about 10 years ago that said, in the future, there won't be elections, there'll be technocrats.
[01:18:54.409 --> 01:18:58.012]  And they went on to say, we need big corporations to run things, not these politicians.
[01:18:58.939 --> 01:19:03.296]  And they basically admitted there's moves to not have real leaders, or real leadership.
[01:19:03.316 --> 01:19:04.662]  That's how you get rid of a nation state.
[01:19:05.762 --> 01:19:21.428]  Because you carry out really corrupt, horrible global policies in the name of a nation-state, you have the nation-state pay for it, and then they blame the politicians that are just puppets for what was carried out, and so the people get more demoralized, the nation-state gets demonized, and then basically gets undermined and collapsed.
[01:19:21.468 --> 01:19:27.910]  They're not collapsing blue cities by mismanagement, though they set up mismanagement on purpose, they're doing it by design.
[01:19:28.150 --> 01:19:32.372]  They're not cutting off the energy and the fertilizer and dumbing people down in education,
[01:19:33.012 --> 01:19:39.978]  By accident, Kamala Harris's controllers, she is stupid, don't want price controls because they think it's going to work, it's because it's going to wreck things.
[01:19:41.059 --> 01:19:48.706]  For the smaller and mid-sized companies, but the globalists have unlimited money, they can sit back when things fall apart and consolidate control, vertical integration of the economy, centralization.
[01:19:49.527 --> 01:19:55.593]  That's the plan with the central bank digital currencies and the social credit scores and the ESGs and the rest of it.
[01:19:56.073 --> 01:19:57.615]  And so yes, there is a plan
[01:19:58.772 --> 01:20:06.276]  To put incompetent people in government who will get the blame, who will follow any orders, to demoralize and break the will of the people.
[01:20:06.756 --> 01:20:18.223]  It was declassified in the 80s, and starting in the 60s, the CIA paid for anti-family messages and ugly art and ugly architecture to dehumanize you and depress you.
[01:20:18.783 --> 01:20:21.464]  When you look at beautiful architecture, you feel uplifted.
[01:20:21.745 --> 01:20:26.107]  Whether it's in India, or the Middle East, or the cathedrals of Europe, it's beautiful.
[01:20:26.927 --> 01:20:27.668]  Now it's all ugly.
[01:20:28.598 --> 01:20:30.459]  And you can just, if you hear me say this, you can look it up.
[01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:32.940]  CIA paid for ugly art, ugly architecture.
[01:20:33.301 --> 01:20:36.523]  This has all been a long-term plan, okay?
[01:20:37.643 --> 01:20:42.046]  So, they're just training you to not value things that are good and not defend them.
[01:20:42.866 --> 01:20:47.849]  And the biggest thing is not valuing newborn babies, or babies in the womb, or valuing old people.
[01:20:48.289 --> 01:20:50.871]  They say they love humans, but oh, let's euthanize everybody.
[01:20:51.581 --> 01:20:52.301]  There's too many people.
[01:20:52.341 --> 01:20:53.262]  People are bad for the Earth.
[01:20:53.722 --> 01:20:55.783]  It's about training you to turn off your life force.
[01:20:56.363 --> 01:20:59.965]  It's about training you to turn off your will to survive.
[01:21:00.025 --> 01:21:04.967]  It's about turning off your vision of being part of the human compendium of past, present, and future.
[01:21:05.667 --> 01:21:07.248]  Let's jam in one more call before we go to break.
[01:21:07.368 --> 01:21:08.889]  Zachary in Louisiana.
[01:21:08.929 --> 01:21:09.669]  Welcome, Zachary.
[01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:11.430]  Hey, Alex.
[01:21:11.670 --> 01:21:12.831]  Thanks for having me on your show.
[01:21:14.211 --> 01:21:14.471]  Welcome.
[01:21:16.178 --> 01:21:19.862]  Graduating from college, my undergrad, in about four months.
[01:21:20.122 --> 01:21:22.785]  My wife, she'll be graduating from veterinary school in eight.
[01:21:23.606 --> 01:21:29.132]  And, you know, she's in her senior year, doesn't have a lot of time to, you know, kind of take any of this in.
[01:21:30.153 --> 01:21:31.674]  Doesn't really have the mental capacity for that.
[01:21:31.694 --> 01:21:34.177]  So I'm trying to do as much preparation as I can.
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:41.002]  The main thing that I'm worried about is, you know, I took a shot, the first shot, four years ago.
[01:21:41.142 --> 01:21:41.942]  She took three.
[01:21:42.222 --> 01:21:49.504]  She's in veterinary school, doesn't really have an option not to take it if she wants to continue school, work, also a very immunocompromised parent.
[01:21:50.305 --> 01:21:55.046]  So, what are some steps that we can take to combat these side effects?
[01:21:55.346 --> 01:22:01.808]  You know, specifically, if this, you know, sterilization really is, you know, one of the main side effects.
[01:22:02.712 --> 01:22:06.634]  Sure, sure.
[01:22:06.734 --> 01:22:12.918]  I'm not a scientist or medical doctor, though I interview a lot of them, and I'll ask Dr. Robert Malone that.
[01:22:12.938 --> 01:22:14.018]  In fact, I'm going to write a note down.
[01:22:14.058 --> 01:22:16.680]  Guys, actually write that out as a printout so I don't forget.
[01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:19.962]  Just say, ask Robert Malone about ways to detox.
[01:22:20.962 --> 01:22:22.564]  He's the inventor of mRNA technology.
[01:22:22.985 --> 01:22:24.707]  There's a cocktail of nano-lipid particles.
[01:22:24.727 --> 01:22:25.989]  There's a bunch of stuff in there.
[01:22:26.469 --> 01:22:34.039]  The good news is, if the shots get above 87 degrees for just a few minutes, the Pfizer and Moderna are the exact same shot.
[01:22:34.059 --> 01:22:37.904]  Just Moderna's four times stronger, or four times larger concentrate.
[01:22:39.185 --> 01:22:42.546]  Uh, then it doesn't have the self-replicating factor breaks down.
[01:22:42.586 --> 01:22:43.687]  It's still a toxic shot.
[01:22:44.807 --> 01:22:50.229]  And because of a lot of the incompetence and things, even inside the system, a lot of this stuff was not kept refrigerated.
[01:22:50.309 --> 01:22:52.410]  So that's a big part of what happened.
[01:22:52.490 --> 01:22:54.131]  Also, they sent out a lot of placebos.
[01:22:54.151 --> 01:22:54.951]  We knew that at the time.
[01:22:55.351 --> 01:22:56.732]  It's been confirmed all over the world.
[01:22:57.152 --> 01:22:59.073]  They sent out about half the shots were placebos.
[01:22:59.983 --> 01:23:10.507]  And they bombed conservative and Christian areas demographically by sending out lots that had a higher rate of actually having the cocktail of garbage in it.
[01:23:11.228 --> 01:23:14.049]  The mRNA and the delivery systems and the toxins and all the rest of it.
[01:23:14.529 --> 01:23:20.351]  They also put in the documents they changed up and mixed all sorts of weird blood thinners in with them to see what that would do.
[01:23:20.371 --> 01:23:22.412]  It was a giant war game test.
[01:23:23.412 --> 01:23:28.094]  So I would tell you, it's not worth it to have a heart attack or die of cancer to even have a veterinary degree.
[01:23:28.134 --> 01:23:28.975]  There are paths
[01:23:30.076 --> 01:23:36.289]  I understand at the time they tried to make it look like you had to, but the truth is they're losing all those lawsuits, the military's backed off.
[01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:39.772]  This lie that you've got to take all these shots is a bluff.
[01:23:40.032 --> 01:23:40.813]  I would not take them.
[01:23:41.553 --> 01:23:48.578]  I know Dr. Mickiewicz, when she saw our formula, said it's really good for detoxing the blood and thinning out the blood and doing a lot of things.
[01:23:48.878 --> 01:23:50.960]  I'm not going to say, you know, get that for that.
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:52.501]  It's just very, very good.
[01:23:52.541 --> 01:23:54.843]  You know, now they have signs all over buses and billboards.
[01:23:55.243 --> 01:23:56.284]  Kids have stroke too.
[01:23:56.424 --> 01:23:57.785]  You know, heart attacks are loving.
[01:23:58.185 --> 01:23:59.066]  Heart attacks are wonderful.
[01:23:59.086 --> 01:24:02.068]  There's a new Harvard UK government-backed study.
[01:24:02.728 --> 01:24:07.233]  I mean, overhead shot.
[01:24:07.733 --> 01:24:09.976]  This is something that you don't want to play around with.
[01:24:10.796 --> 01:24:19.205]  And so, yes, detox, and there's a lot of research out there, but at the same time, do not take any more of them.
[01:24:19.826 --> 01:24:21.627]  My goodness, you don't have to let these people do that.
[01:24:22.048 --> 01:24:23.009]  Stay there, Zachary.
[01:24:23.029 --> 01:24:24.470]  I want you to get some time to finish up.
[01:24:25.191 --> 01:24:29.113]  When we come back, and then I'm going to go to Jacob and others.
[01:24:29.654 --> 01:24:37.679]  We'll get through all the callers that are on the board right now, but no more callers after that, because Dr. Robert Malone, the father of mRNA, joins us in T-minus 32 minutes.
[01:24:43.524 --> 01:24:46.426]  High-quality CBD gummies.
[01:24:47.366 --> 01:24:52.349]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com via the InfoWars MD line.
[01:24:52.849 --> 01:25:00.014]  Now, this is a private label of one of the top supplement makers in the country of high-end quality at reasonable prices.
[01:25:00.574 --> 01:25:02.555]  They let us private label their products.
[01:25:02.575 --> 01:25:03.456]  That's why you've already heard of
[01:25:04.309 --> 01:25:05.350]  Bodies Old Turmeric Formula?
[01:25:05.670 --> 01:25:08.433]  Well, we got the 95% curcuminoid from them.
[01:25:08.673 --> 01:25:09.995]  This is just their brand of that.
[01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:13.278]  And so, it is available under Turmeric 95.
[01:25:14.018 --> 01:25:14.639]  That's the name.
[01:25:14.899 --> 01:25:20.585]  So, we're sold out of bodies, but we have Turmeric 95 that is, again, the same concentrated
[01:25:21.125 --> 01:25:23.326]  Alright, I'm going to finish up with Zachary.
[01:25:41.621 --> 01:25:45.703]  His wife's about to graduate as a veterinarian and they put up giving her three shots.
[01:25:45.743 --> 01:25:46.404]  He's taking one.
[01:25:46.424 --> 01:25:47.344]  He's went on a detox.
[01:25:47.384 --> 01:25:48.105]  He's wanting my advice.
[01:25:48.125 --> 01:25:52.427]  The last Dr Malone coming up his view on that before I go back to the callers, I'm going to hit.
[01:25:53.848 --> 01:25:56.690]  Not just here, but in Europe, the UK, Canada.
[01:25:57.822 --> 01:26:06.944]  Arresting peaceful protesters, taking their bank accounts away, and putting them in jail for three months, six months, two years.
[01:26:07.964 --> 01:26:10.305]  Most sentences are about 18 to 22 months long.
[01:26:10.785 --> 01:26:12.445]  And it's the same program all over the world.
[01:26:12.985 --> 01:26:19.627]  And now the Democrats are running around on the ground at the DNC in Chicago calling for it, while they say that we're going to do that to them.
[01:26:20.526 --> 01:26:22.186]  Remember, whatever they say we're going to do, they're going to do.
[01:26:23.187 --> 01:26:25.067]  I would never do that unless they'd committed crimes.
[01:26:25.147 --> 01:26:33.729]  The bosses need to go to jail because we'd be aiding and abetting them if we didn't get control of the Justice Department and give them lawful trials.
[01:26:33.809 --> 01:26:37.390]  But they're coming after everybody, folks.
[01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:39.290]  They're the totalitarians, so we'll hit that in a moment.
[01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:43.571]  But, Zachary, you heard my response to what you and your wife are going through.
[01:26:43.591 --> 01:26:46.552]  Do you have any other questions or statements?
[01:26:47.591 --> 01:26:47.931]  Yeah.
[01:26:48.091 --> 01:26:55.534]  So the last thing that I wanted to kind of ask you about is, you know, I know there's a lot that we, that I can't control and I'm, you know, I'm praying a lot and getting right with God.
[01:26:55.554 --> 01:27:00.196]  Um, you know, I take your iodine X2, which has been phenomenal.
[01:27:00.236 --> 01:27:14.362]  I'm on the wait list for their curcumin 95, just ordered the nitric boost, but this new monkey pox virus that's coming out, is that something that we really need to try to protect ourselves from through means other than this vaccine that they're trying to push?
[01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:19.921]  I'm sorry, say that last part again.
[01:27:21.622 --> 01:27:26.345]  This new monkeypox virus that's coming out, is that something that we need to try to take precautions?
[01:27:26.605 --> 01:27:34.310]  You know, not using the vaccine that they're trying to push, but through other means of, like, you know, continuing to take curcumin and other natural resources.
[01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:37.392]  Yeah, well you said, you said turmeric 95, you're on a waiting list.
[01:27:37.472 --> 01:27:39.714]  It came in last week, so you shouldn't be on a waiting list now.
[01:27:39.774 --> 01:27:40.514]  It should be shipping to you.
[01:27:40.594 --> 01:27:40.834]  Okay.
[01:27:45.805 --> 01:27:46.326]  Here's the deal.
[01:27:47.126 --> 01:27:49.308]  You only get monkey pox from sexual contact.
[01:27:49.948 --> 01:27:51.809]  99% of it is in the homosexual population.
[01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:54.591]  I showed the CDC and UN's own documents last night.
[01:27:55.112 --> 01:27:57.753]  So that report's on X. That's total hype.
[01:27:57.773 --> 01:27:59.675]  It's total hysteria, just like the bird flu.
[01:28:00.295 --> 01:28:06.879]  Unless they've got a weaponized form on the shelf they're getting to release, which we know they've weaponized it.
[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:08.981]  They've done war games about weaponizing it.
[01:28:11.206 --> 01:28:13.608]  We'll be talking about that next hour with Dr. Robert Malone.
[01:28:13.648 --> 01:28:15.789]  But I mean, look, that's what they're gonna do.
[01:28:15.829 --> 01:28:18.071]  They've already got a new bird flu mRNA shot ready.
[01:28:18.391 --> 01:28:20.333]  They're getting a monkeypox shot ready.
[01:28:20.733 --> 01:28:22.674]  There's no reason to take that.
[01:28:23.155 --> 01:28:24.156]  It's totally made up.
[01:28:24.536 --> 01:28:26.757]  The last shots did not protect people.
[01:28:26.777 --> 01:28:28.138]  They erased their immune system.
[01:28:28.499 --> 01:28:30.320]  You said your wife's immunocompromised.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:31.141]  Look up.
[01:28:31.401 --> 01:28:35.444]  mRNA COVID shot attacks the immune system.
[01:28:36.084 --> 01:28:37.285]  Weakens the immune system.
[01:28:37.666 --> 01:28:39.307]  Five shots basically gets rid of it.
[01:28:40.267 --> 01:28:43.108]  They don't know if it ever comes back in the studies, because there's not been enough time.
[01:28:43.508 --> 01:28:45.288]  So this is playing Russian roulette.
[01:28:45.448 --> 01:28:46.429]  God bless you and be safe.
[01:28:47.549 --> 01:28:48.609]  All right, let me hit this news.
[01:28:49.029 --> 01:28:53.210]  We'll go back to your calls, because I saw this video about 45 minutes ago.
[01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:55.031]  It's now posted on Alex Jones.
[01:28:55.991 --> 01:29:00.732]  And these are leftists running around Chicago saying they want re-education camps for Americans.
[01:29:01.552 --> 01:29:06.974]  Now, that's a standard Democrat Party weatherman underground that trained Barack Obama idea.
[01:29:07.779 --> 01:29:15.123]  And they estimated back in the 70s they'd have to put 50 million people in camps who were conservatives or Christians and kill half of them, 25 million.
[01:29:15.343 --> 01:29:19.666]  I could play that clip from the FBI trial of the Weathermen.
[01:29:20.786 --> 01:29:21.567]  They admitted all this.
[01:29:21.607 --> 01:29:29.451]  So that's what you're seeing is a bunch of Weathermen-esque, hardcore, sicko, crazy people that want to put people in camps.
[01:29:29.471 --> 01:29:30.772]  I mean, look how wild their eyes are.
[01:29:31.432 --> 01:29:33.333]  And then I'm going to show you this is coming from the top.
[01:29:33.593 --> 01:29:34.254]  So let's roll the clip.
[01:29:37.945 --> 01:29:40.006]  Only Republican voters.
[01:29:40.087 --> 01:29:43.069]  I would love everybody who's Republican to get down.
[01:29:43.229 --> 01:29:45.611]  When they say, oh we hate America, no we don't.
[01:29:45.711 --> 01:29:46.251]  We hate you.
[01:29:46.932 --> 01:29:47.833]  We love America.
[01:29:47.893 --> 01:29:48.773]  We hate you.
[01:29:48.913 --> 01:29:50.134]  It's not good to hate anyone.
[01:29:50.355 --> 01:29:51.235]  I don't hate anyone.
[01:29:51.255 --> 01:29:53.677]  Hey, let me ask you a question.
[01:29:55.584 --> 01:30:01.671]  If you were an elected official, do you think it might be a good idea to like, put these Republican Trump supporting QAnon voters in like, re-education facilities and stuff?
[01:30:01.691 --> 01:30:01.972]  Yes!
[01:30:02.032 --> 01:30:02.192]  Yes!
[01:30:02.392 --> 01:30:04.234]  Yeah, re-educate them?
[01:30:04.314 --> 01:30:04.535]  Yes!
[01:30:04.575 --> 01:30:04.975]  No!
[01:30:05.255 --> 01:30:05.496]  No!
[01:30:06.056 --> 01:30:12.003]  I spent four days, I went into the court in his trial in New York, and I spent four days with these people.
[01:30:12.043 --> 01:30:13.485]  We're trying to save them from themselves though.
[01:30:13.625 --> 01:30:14.346]  I'm sorry, but...
[01:30:15.687 --> 01:30:16.788]  I know what we want.
[01:30:16.848 --> 01:30:18.029]  I mean, I am serious.
[01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:19.231]  I'm not being facetious.
[01:30:19.351 --> 01:30:27.738]  I am seriously concerned for the psyche of people who will take, who will sell anything somebody says without critical thinking.
[01:30:28.499 --> 01:30:37.487]  You and I may disagree on something, but if we can critically think about it and say why we disagree and it is something factual or too much taxes,
[01:30:39.469 --> 01:30:48.018]  Let's just stop right there, because there's such idiots that they're both talking full blast, but if you tune her out and listen to him, he's like, white nationalists, blah, blah, blah, we're going to put them all in camps.
[01:30:48.038 --> 01:30:49.419]  Crazed, mindless maniacs.
[01:31:02.168 --> 01:31:03.529]  Now, where are they hearing this?
[01:31:04.130 --> 01:31:12.797]  Well, here's Peter Hotez, spokesperson for the WHO, talking about how they want to use NATO and the UN for martial law.
[01:31:12.957 --> 01:31:13.298]  Here it is.
[01:31:13.763 --> 01:31:20.547]  Unfortunately, I have to give you a very long, I-don't-know-the-answer-to-your-question answer, because it is very complicated.
[01:31:20.587 --> 01:31:28.232]  And quite honestly, you know, the health sector doesn't know what to do, because this is now first and foremost a political problem.
[01:31:29.353 --> 01:31:37.338]  And what I've said to the Biden administration is the health sector can't solve this on its own.
[01:31:37.358 --> 01:31:38.719]  We're going to have to bring in
[01:31:40.129 --> 01:31:45.673]  Homeland Security, Commerce Department, Justice Department to help us understand how to do this.
[01:31:45.813 --> 01:31:56.500]  And I've said the same with, I met with Dr. Tedros last month in Geneva, WHO, the Director General, to say I don't know that the World Health Organization
[01:31:56.980 --> 01:31:58.281]  We can solve this on our own.
[01:31:58.321 --> 01:32:00.884]  We need the other United Nations agencies.
[01:32:01.604 --> 01:32:09.811]  NATO, this is a security problem because it's no longer a theoretical construct or some arcane academic exercise.
[01:32:09.831 --> 01:32:10.832]  200,000 Americans died.
[01:32:13.112 --> 01:32:16.554]  Because of anti-vaccine aggression, anti-science aggression.
[01:32:17.054 --> 01:32:35.542]  And so this is now a lethal force that, and now I feel as a pediatric vaccine scientist, it's just as though it's important, just as it's important for me to make new vaccines to save lives, the other side of saving lives is countering this anti-vaccine aggression.
[01:32:36.249 --> 01:32:39.290]  With NATO, with the UN, with the military.
[01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:40.291]  And they built the camps.
[01:32:40.631 --> 01:32:42.312]  They've set in Canada and Australia and England.
[01:32:42.712 --> 01:32:50.075]  Next time there's a pandemic, which the UN has announced over monkey pox, 99% gay men and a bunch of children that have been raped.
[01:32:52.516 --> 01:32:52.976]  He says,
[01:32:55.046 --> 01:32:56.467]  That we need to put you in these camps.
[01:32:57.128 --> 01:32:58.509]  So that's what they're doing.
[01:32:58.569 --> 01:33:00.531]  That's what they're setting up.
[01:33:00.571 --> 01:33:03.353]  And I can play you Texas, the head of the Texas Health Department.
[01:33:03.373 --> 01:33:04.374]  The clip's like eight years old.
[01:33:05.015 --> 01:33:06.076]  I've played it probably 50 times.
[01:33:06.736 --> 01:33:07.997]  She's at a big event in Houston.
[01:33:08.017 --> 01:33:09.719]  She says, white people are the problem.
[01:33:09.999 --> 01:33:11.120]  They're not taking all their shots.
[01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:12.561]  We need to get rid of all the white people.
[01:33:12.581 --> 01:33:17.686]  I mean, just total totalitarian dreams of grandeur, but they're doing it.
[01:33:17.966 --> 01:33:21.068]  They already locked us down and people in the third world for over two years.
[01:33:21.809 --> 01:33:23.789]  They're bringing out worldwide vaccine passports.
[01:33:24.630 --> 01:33:25.550]  Here's Eric Schmidt.
[01:33:25.690 --> 01:33:30.311]  AI think tank urges NATO to monitor disinformation in real time, coordinate responses.
[01:33:30.751 --> 01:33:34.472]  NATO needs to run the response for lockdowns and force injecting.
[01:33:34.512 --> 01:33:36.972]  This is the head of the Pentagon's AI program.
[01:33:37.012 --> 01:33:37.412]  Here he is.
[01:33:38.333 --> 01:33:44.854]  Watching the Russians use tanks to destroy apartment buildings with little old ladies and kids just drove me crazy.
[01:33:45.723 --> 01:33:52.908]  So I decided to work on a company with your friend, Sebastian Thrun, as a former faculty member here, and a whole bunch of Stanford people.
[01:33:54.116 --> 01:33:57.537]  And the idea basically is to do two things.
[01:33:57.997 --> 01:34:01.998]  Use AI in complicated, powerful ways for these essentially robotic war.
[01:34:02.718 --> 01:34:05.078]  And the second one is to lower the cost of the robots.
[01:34:05.678 --> 01:34:09.279]  Now you sit there and you go, why would a good liberal like me do that?
[01:34:09.819 --> 01:34:16.161]  And the answer is that the whole theory of armies is tanks, artilleries, and mortar.
[01:34:16.861 --> 01:34:18.341]  And we can eliminate all of them.
[01:34:19.136 --> 01:34:23.217]  And we can make the penalty for invading a country, at least by law.
[01:34:23.257 --> 01:34:24.918]  You know, I sent the crew the article.
[01:34:24.938 --> 01:34:26.278]  The video's here.
[01:34:27.098 --> 01:34:28.358]  They're playing the one from last week.
[01:34:28.498 --> 01:34:30.799]  I'm just going to read you the transcript of what he said.
[01:34:30.839 --> 01:34:32.740]  We'll get it done old tech wise for you.
[01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:34.680]  But it's on InfoWars.com.
[01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:35.960]  Let's read the article.
[01:34:36.601 --> 01:34:41.862]  Eric Schmidt's AI think tank urges NATO to monitor this information in real time, coordinate responses.
[01:34:43.882 --> 01:34:45.623]  And he goes on from there.
[01:34:46.792 --> 01:34:55.859]  He says you might still think about Eric Schmidt as a big tech guy and businessman, but his passion for geopolitics will always be evident, even when he served as Google's CEO.
[01:34:56.199 --> 01:35:08.988]  These days, Schmidt is the chair of the Special Comprehensive Studies Project, a think tank that would like to position itself as the reference point to military alliance NATO and get in to monitor disinformation in real time.
[01:35:09.028 --> 01:35:12.611]  The SCPS's ambition is no less than to help craft
[01:35:13.567 --> 01:35:18.885]  New national security strategies always with the eye on the alleged attempts to increase his information.
[01:35:20.418 --> 01:35:23.399]  And of course, AI is to blame, but also ways to combat that.
[01:35:23.439 --> 01:35:26.821]  And here's SCSP's says, the U.S.
[01:35:26.861 --> 01:35:28.661]  must strengthen its AI competitiveness.
[01:35:28.982 --> 01:35:33.864]  The goal is to win what's referred to as the techno economic competition 2030.
[01:35:34.704 --> 01:35:38.045]  That's the deadline favored by many controversial globalist initiative.
[01:35:38.446 --> 01:35:43.308]  Here's the group would like NATO and its members to fight against what is described as AI disinformation.
[01:35:43.708 --> 01:35:45.428]  The new chapter in information warfare.
[01:35:45.488 --> 01:35:46.049]  Schmidt thinks
[01:35:46.829 --> 01:35:53.452]  Think Tank doesn't think that it's seen as the current reactive approach of the tried old debunking.
[01:35:53.753 --> 01:36:01.837]  That means there must be an active one and the replacement for debunking would logically be some form of dystopian concept of pre-bunking.
[01:36:02.637 --> 01:36:13.065]  The SCSP mentions both a desirable methods of late 2020 to report but this time shies away from using the latter term.
[01:36:13.765 --> 01:36:23.313]  The SCSP wants various actors to carry out the real-time surveillance of quote disinformation by means of spending money on tools fed with
[01:36:24.178 --> 01:36:29.960]  Publicly available online data, aka the cynically named open source data.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.082]  In other words, the real-time mass-scale internet data scraping.
[01:36:33.422 --> 01:36:38.144]  Such tools already exist and are used by law enforcement, causing various levels of controversy.
[01:36:38.524 --> 01:36:43.046]  Next comes pre-bunking even the latest batch of SCSP recommendations.
[01:36:43.126 --> 01:36:45.527]  Short, stop short of calling it that.
[01:36:45.887 --> 01:36:46.847]  But what do you call it?
[01:36:47.167 --> 01:36:53.490]  NATO, this is his quote, should provide its own positive narrative to get out ahead of disinformation and highlight failures
[01:36:54.671 --> 01:36:54.991]  All right.
[01:37:19.244 --> 01:37:20.285]  Let's continue on now.
[01:37:20.905 --> 01:37:22.387]  Let's look at this report right here.
[01:37:22.787 --> 01:37:29.413]  Remember this from June of 2021, National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.
[01:37:29.673 --> 01:37:33.997]  And it says if you're against lockdowns and forced injections, you need to be targeted as a terrorist.
[01:37:35.058 --> 01:37:38.361]  The UK came out on Friday and said misogyny is now terrorism.
[01:37:39.261 --> 01:37:40.883]  Let's continue with this overhead shot.
[01:37:42.492 --> 01:37:49.315]  UK to release 5,000 prisoners to make room for nationalists labeled far-right by the government.
[01:37:49.715 --> 01:37:54.176]  So they're emptying out the criminals, you see that everywhere, to put political dissonance in them.
[01:37:56.297 --> 01:38:00.539]  Now let's play a clip of Raskin talking about shibble war in America.
[01:38:00.679 --> 01:38:01.099]  Here it is.
[01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:03.004]  We're good to go.
[01:38:18.201 --> 01:38:19.122]  We're good to go.
[01:38:48.161 --> 01:38:52.225]  Are you confident that there will be a peaceful transfer of power in January 2025?
[01:38:52.265 --> 01:38:53.927]  If Trump wins, no I'm not confident at all.
[01:39:13.174 --> 01:39:15.716]  I mean, if Trump loses, I'm not confident at all.
[01:39:16.297 --> 01:39:17.137]  He means what he says.
[01:39:17.198 --> 01:39:18.318]  We don't take him seriously.
[01:39:18.539 --> 01:39:18.959]  That's enough.
[01:39:18.979 --> 01:39:19.439]  He means it.
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:20.620]  Okay.
[01:39:21.781 --> 01:39:22.842]  They found the clip very quickly.
[01:39:22.882 --> 01:39:23.583]  Great job, crew.
[01:39:23.623 --> 01:39:24.804]  This is Carol J. Baker.
[01:39:25.445 --> 01:39:29.328]  At the time, she was the deputy head of the state health department and over vaccines.
[01:39:29.708 --> 01:39:31.610]  Here she is saying, get rid of the white people.
[01:39:32.591 --> 01:39:32.971]  Fight.
[01:39:33.892 --> 01:39:35.573]  The battle is being fought.
[01:39:36.534 --> 01:39:37.215]  One family.
[01:39:37.871 --> 01:39:40.292]  One physician, one health center.
[01:39:40.912 --> 01:39:42.853]  That's why we're doing as well as we are.
[01:39:42.893 --> 01:39:47.134]  We're talking about the minority and strategies against the minority.
[01:39:47.194 --> 01:39:49.075]  So I have the solution.
[01:39:50.075 --> 01:40:01.618]  Every study published in the last five years, when you look at vaccine refusers, I'm not talking about, well, hesitance, most of them we can talk into coming to terms, but refusers.
[01:40:03.059 --> 01:40:06.240]  We'll just get rid of all the whites in the United States.
[01:40:07.256 --> 01:40:12.338]  Because Houston is the most diverse city in the entire United States.
[01:40:12.658 --> 01:40:15.438]  There's seven Asian languages spoken in that city.
[01:40:16.579 --> 01:40:21.500]  I've been a minority for more than 20 years in the city of Houston.
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:24.301]  The majority is, we call, Hispanic.
[01:40:25.201 --> 01:40:27.702]  That is not a race or an ethnicity.
[01:40:27.762 --> 01:40:29.603]  That is a political designation.
[01:40:29.683 --> 01:40:33.504]  But a lot of them are from Central, South America, Mexico.
[01:40:34.378 --> 01:40:36.939]  Guess who wants to get vaccinated the most?
[01:40:38.659 --> 01:40:39.259]  Immigrants.
[01:40:39.279 --> 01:40:44.681]  It's a death cult, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:44.821 --> 01:40:46.241]  Get rid of the white people.
[01:40:46.621 --> 01:40:48.782]  All right, I wanted to get all that together in one spot.
[01:40:49.782 --> 01:40:51.162]  Thanks for the crew grabbing it so quick.
[01:40:51.583 --> 01:40:52.623]  I kind of took us on a segue.
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:55.200]  A little detour, but it was important.
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:56.601]  Let's go to David.
[01:40:57.041 --> 01:40:58.441]  And of course, here's the headline.
[01:40:59.261 --> 01:41:05.342]  Doctors killed in Brazilian plane crash promise to release evidence to tying mRNA vaccines to turbo cancer.
[01:41:05.402 --> 01:41:07.043]  Hell, I got major studies here admitting it.
[01:41:07.783 --> 01:41:12.044]  Also, the doctor group reportedly had a 97% cure for many forms of cancer.
[01:41:13.644 --> 01:41:14.524]  Eight of them died.
[01:41:15.205 --> 01:41:21.286]  David is in New Mexico, retired airline pilot on the recent plane crash and has something to say about this.
[01:41:21.306 --> 01:41:21.586]  Go ahead.
[01:41:23.018 --> 01:41:23.979]  Yeah, I got several things.
[01:41:24.359 --> 01:41:27.000]  One critically important that I don't think you'll hear anywhere else.
[01:41:27.801 --> 01:41:30.642]  But first of all, most importantly, this is tongue-in-cheek.
[01:41:30.702 --> 01:41:31.603]  Don't get offended, Alex.
[01:41:32.083 --> 01:41:34.244]  There's an R in turmeric, Alex.
[01:41:34.264 --> 01:41:35.025]  You're driving me nuts.
[01:41:36.005 --> 01:41:36.386]  Turmeric.
[01:41:36.506 --> 01:41:36.846]  Turmeric.
[01:41:37.206 --> 01:41:37.566]  Just kidding.
[01:41:38.407 --> 01:41:39.847]  Are you really a retired airline pilot?
[01:41:41.008 --> 01:41:41.208]  Yeah.
[01:41:41.288 --> 01:41:42.169]  What do you want me to do?
[01:41:42.269 --> 01:41:42.669]  Test me.
[01:41:42.789 --> 01:41:43.149]  Test me.
[01:41:43.329 --> 01:41:45.431]  Actually, you can go to the FAA site and look up my name.
[01:41:45.451 --> 01:41:47.051]  Want to do that?
[01:41:47.071 --> 01:41:48.432]  No, you just don't sound like any airline pilot.
[01:41:48.452 --> 01:41:49.513]  Go ahead and make your point.
[01:41:50.569 --> 01:41:51.089]  Oh, okay.
[01:41:52.170 --> 01:41:52.850]  I didn't say any of it.
[01:41:53.291 --> 01:41:56.312]  I tell you what, I just don't like to play games, man.
[01:41:56.432 --> 01:41:56.733]  Okay?
[01:41:57.433 --> 01:41:58.894]  You don't like my Texas accent?
[01:42:00.295 --> 01:42:00.815]  Hang up on him.
[01:42:00.895 --> 01:42:01.355]  Hang up on him.
[01:42:01.375 --> 01:42:02.236]  Thanks for the call.
[01:42:03.116 --> 01:42:06.318]  Look, I love people that disagree, but I'm not going to play your games.
[01:42:06.338 --> 01:42:07.599]  You're not a retired airline pilot.
[01:42:07.619 --> 01:42:08.299]  You're full of crap.
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:11.541]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Dawn in Colorado.
[01:42:11.561 --> 01:42:12.041]  You're on the air.
[01:42:12.081 --> 01:42:12.622]  Go ahead, Dawn.
[01:42:14.043 --> 01:42:15.463]  Well, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:42:16.364 --> 01:42:17.304]  Good to talk to you.
[01:42:18.025 --> 01:42:19.806]  I had a disconnect earlier, but
[01:42:20.535 --> 01:42:21.515]  I do have an iPhone.
[01:42:22.276 --> 01:42:22.816]  Okay.
[01:42:24.857 --> 01:42:25.577]  I see you.
[01:42:25.597 --> 01:42:26.818]  I just wanted to let you know.
[01:42:26.838 --> 01:42:33.361]  I can close my eyes and I can see you fully dressed in the armor of God.
[01:42:33.381 --> 01:42:48.768]  It would be so cool to see your crew design that and put it up for us to see because your body and your everything is the armor of God.
[01:42:50.154 --> 01:42:53.477]  The lady from Florida earlier, Margo, she got the memo too, I guess.
[01:42:54.638 --> 01:42:57.900]  But we all need to be, I appreciate, we all need to be in the armor, God.
[01:42:58.181 --> 01:43:00.663]  I'm sure Chase Geiser with AI can put that out real quick.
[01:43:02.104 --> 01:43:02.884]  That would be great.
[01:43:03.265 --> 01:43:04.365]  Yeah, love Chase.
[01:43:06.087 --> 01:43:07.508]  Love, love Owen.
[01:43:07.748 --> 01:43:10.510]  He's one of my favorites and I listen to Harris every morning.
[01:43:10.631 --> 01:43:12.352]  So, you guys are great.
[01:43:12.672 --> 01:43:16.816]  My husband turned me on to you several years ago and we are
[01:43:19.051 --> 01:43:21.913]  A family of six children, 11 grandchildren.
[01:43:22.694 --> 01:43:25.196]  I am a three-time cancer survivor.
[01:43:25.216 --> 01:43:33.162]  I take your X3 survival shield, your bodies, your brain force ultra, and listen to me.
[01:43:33.382 --> 01:43:37.525]  I'm 63 years old, and I'm... No, I'm sorry.
[01:43:37.565 --> 01:43:39.467]  I'm 66 years old, and I'm full of it.
[01:43:39.947 --> 01:43:40.387]  Full of it.
[01:43:41.708 --> 01:43:47.633]  God has appointed me to learn how to grow food, and I have a magnificent garden going.
[01:43:48.325 --> 01:43:48.965]  Beautiful.
[01:43:50.046 --> 01:43:52.688]  Canning, I encourage everyone.
[01:43:53.408 --> 01:44:00.152]  My topic today, I'll get to that, there's a movie I saw several years ago called Don't Look Up.
[01:44:00.213 --> 01:44:01.133]  Did you ever see that?
[01:44:01.413 --> 01:44:01.733]  Yes.
[01:44:02.974 --> 01:44:03.294]  Okay.
[01:44:04.035 --> 01:44:09.318]  That female president reminds me so much of Kamala.
[01:44:10.879 --> 01:44:15.022]  I think maybe Kamala saw the movie herself.
[01:44:16.252 --> 01:44:44.320]  I may be mentored after that, but it is about this ginormous, for those who didn't see it, it's either a meteor or a comet headed for Earth, and this female president is lying to the people, it's basically set up to be America, and asking them, telling them, don't look up, because she's not
[01:44:44.847 --> 01:45:08.288]  Wanting them to understand or know what's really coming at us and what's going to happen the world is going to be destroyed so Kamala in comparison to that along with the blonde hair Her don't look up is don't come don't the border is secure so
[01:45:11.121 --> 01:45:31.187]  Her ginormous object headed for us is the invasion, an army of illegal immigrants that have come to this country with many sleeper cells just awaiting the order to attack the people.
[01:45:32.928 --> 01:45:39.390]  And I just wanted to give my viewpoint on that and let you know how much I care for you.
[01:45:40.393 --> 01:45:44.942]  And praise for you and your crew and the people who...
[01:45:47.774 --> 01:45:51.196]  Well, Don, I want to say thank you because we're all in this together.
[01:45:51.876 --> 01:45:53.797]  And the globalists do want to extinct humanity.
[01:45:53.837 --> 01:45:55.357]  They say they're going to create a new species.
[01:45:55.377 --> 01:45:56.818]  They are a group of mad scientists.
[01:45:57.318 --> 01:46:00.619]  So unlike an asteroid that's coming, this is something we can stop.
[01:46:01.099 --> 01:46:05.261]  We have to admit how horrific it is and how crazy it is and how evil it is.
[01:46:05.901 --> 01:46:09.563]  We put out a report over the weekend that dealt with the plan to extinct humanity.
[01:46:09.583 --> 01:46:12.424]  It's only five minutes long and it's got all their own admissions in it.
[01:46:12.924 --> 01:46:15.667]  So they're doing it chemically through the food and water at just one level.
[01:46:16.108 --> 01:46:17.149]  That's not happening fast enough.
[01:46:17.169 --> 01:46:18.411]  They're trying to start World War III.
[01:46:18.791 --> 01:46:20.533]  These people are really devils.
[01:46:20.553 --> 01:46:21.514]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:46:22.476 --> 01:46:25.019]  Now, Dr. Robert Malone is coming up at 6 after.
[01:46:25.039 --> 01:46:28.383]  We're going to connect a little bit after, you know, the hour starts.
[01:46:29.451 --> 01:46:32.933]  Because I don't want him to be interrupted with that short segment that some stations don't carry.
[01:46:33.213 --> 01:46:37.095]  But I will get a few more calls during that period as well.
[01:46:37.115 --> 01:46:39.256]  I want to thank you all for the support.
[01:46:39.276 --> 01:46:40.737]  You're the people calling in to buy the products.
[01:46:40.757 --> 01:46:41.737]  You're the reason we're here.
[01:46:41.817 --> 01:46:42.618]  So don't thank me.
[01:46:42.798 --> 01:46:44.619]  I want to thank you for keeping us on air.
[01:46:44.919 --> 01:46:45.699]  We're all in this together.
[01:46:45.719 --> 01:46:46.800]  They're great products you need.

[01:48:09.813 --> 01:48:13.575]  So be careful with it, especially if you've had deficiencies and the things that are in it.
[01:48:13.655 --> 01:48:16.797]  I'm not going to go all through it, but it's the concentrate of
[01:48:17.637 --> 01:48:20.802]  Bioavailable, folic acid, methylfolate with a bunch of other stuff.
[01:48:21.202 --> 01:48:21.743]  It's incredible.
[01:48:22.144 --> 01:48:25.008]  Next level of financial energy, top brain, rocket rest.
[01:48:25.068 --> 01:48:25.729]  It's all that.
[01:48:27.128 --> 01:48:30.369]  DrJonesNaturals.com, the whole food, multivitamin, and more.
[01:48:30.589 --> 01:48:48.315]  Now, we've got Nick, we've got David, we've got Jim, we've got John, and I don't want to cut Nick off and others, so I'm going to go to break and come right back in and try to give you, you know, a minute and a half, two minutes, and then if a few other callers want to hold, when Malone leaves, I'll do some time on the air into the fourth hour.
[01:48:48.335 --> 01:48:54.198]  They have a great guest host, always, Gerald Celente, in the fourth hour, but, you know, sometimes I carve out and kind of
[01:48:55.905 --> 01:48:56.787]  Commandeer, actually.
[01:48:56.807 --> 01:48:57.729]  I'm kind of commandeer.
[01:48:57.749 --> 01:48:58.911]  They understand part of doing the fourth hour.
[01:48:58.931 --> 01:49:01.236]  Sometimes I do that, but I want to thank you all.
[01:49:01.316 --> 01:49:02.077]  It's very humbling.
[01:49:02.678 --> 01:49:03.680]  I appreciate you all.
[01:49:04.676 --> 01:49:05.637]  I have a very good memory.
[01:49:06.258 --> 01:49:10.061]  I remember callers that called in, you know, 10 years ago and have not called in since.
[01:49:11.202 --> 01:49:14.105]  And I pretty much knew that earlier callers called in before.
[01:49:14.546 --> 01:49:16.948]  And I just told people playing games, saying he's a retired airline pilot.
[01:49:17.569 --> 01:49:20.291]  And, you know, he's like probably a 30-year-old guy sitting there playing video games.
[01:49:20.992 --> 01:49:22.193]  Not against you playing video games.
[01:49:22.293 --> 01:49:23.634]  I'm just, it's not a game, okay?
[01:49:23.915 --> 01:49:26.037]  And look, I know I say, I don't say pillow.
[01:49:26.157 --> 01:49:26.777]  I say pillow.
[01:49:27.618 --> 01:49:30.461]  And I know that I don't say ten, I say teen.
[01:49:31.041 --> 01:49:37.006]  Okay, because I'm from Texas and that's how I'm raised and that is my, that is how I speak.
[01:49:37.627 --> 01:49:40.029]  And so, you want to make fun of me for being from Texas?
[01:49:40.709 --> 01:49:45.253]  I could speak in a British accent for you if you like, it makes you sound more intelligent.
[01:49:45.553 --> 01:49:48.015]  But yes, I twist words on accident sometimes.
[01:49:48.296 --> 01:49:49.837]  That's the way it is.
[01:49:51.664 --> 01:49:59.047]  Alex Jones here with a call of action, a call to action for all the patriots out there watching or listening to this transmission.
[01:49:59.667 --> 01:50:01.948]  We can't fight the globalists without your support.
[01:50:02.548 --> 01:50:09.070]  And I can't think of an organization or group out there other than President Trump that has had more of an effect against the New World Order than this operation.
[01:50:09.090 --> 01:50:12.651]  And that's because of the grace of God and your support and our intrepid crew.
[01:50:13.132 --> 01:50:19.294]  And I'm asking you now at a critical time, going into this election, when the enemy is trying to shut everybody down and put everybody in prison.
[01:50:20.365 --> 01:50:28.868]  Double down and support the broadcast more than ever to share the articles, the videos, the links, and to get the products at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:50:29.069 --> 01:50:38.152]  So, two and a half years ago, one of our great supporters and sponsors came forward and said, you ought to sell collectible cards with a little ingot of gold in it.
[01:50:38.552 --> 01:50:39.653]  These are very, very popular.
[01:50:39.673 --> 01:50:40.773]  And I went looking up online.
[01:50:41.193 --> 01:50:42.114]  It is very, very popular.
[01:50:42.694 --> 01:50:44.435]  It's not an investment, it's a collectible.
[01:50:44.636 --> 01:50:51.541]  If you want to get gold or silver and get the best prices on it, that's Dr. Kirk Elliott and KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:50:52.001 --> 01:50:56.044]  Best group out there, highest ratings, amazing prices, the best.
[01:50:56.244 --> 01:51:00.327]  This is a collectible and a memento to know you supported the broadcast.
[01:51:00.848 --> 01:51:08.573]  Then the bankruptcy started and the people that came in from the court said, we're not going to keep the outside people's products in here, in your store.
[01:51:09.674 --> 01:51:10.495]  And they kicked him back.
[01:51:11.630 --> 01:51:15.356]  Uh, to the folks, despite the fact we'd already sold out of half of these in just a month.
[01:51:15.656 --> 01:51:17.539]  Well, now that I'm back in control of the company...
[01:51:18.385 --> 01:51:26.830]  And now that InfoWars itself is not in bankruptcy, I am able to offer these again, and this will help keep us on air.
[01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:35.735]  InfoWars has teamed up with one of the nation's leading mints to help you acquire this 24 karat .999 pure gold without paying thousands of dollars an ounce.
[01:51:36.235 --> 01:51:46.441]  Stock up on 24 karat .999 pure gold in the most popular size of one-tenth gram, an affordable, sleek card that fits your wallet, drawer, glove compartment, and is easy to travel with.
[01:51:46.841 --> 01:51:48.342]  They're amazing cards.
[01:51:48.702 --> 01:51:50.503]  It's got original art I came up with.
[01:51:50.603 --> 01:51:53.025]  It's got the little bar of gold in there.
[01:51:53.525 --> 01:51:56.147]  And it just lets you know that you supported the Info War.
[01:51:56.447 --> 01:52:02.510]  You'll have a historical memento as a keepsake for yourself, your family, for your children, and your grandchildren.
[01:52:02.530 --> 01:52:04.171]  Because this is a historic fight.
[01:52:04.551 --> 01:52:08.374]  And this is a true piece of Americana that we have here.
[01:52:08.734 --> 01:52:10.055]  So I'm very, very proud of it.
[01:52:10.695 --> 01:52:13.597]  Again, we sold out of half of these a couple years ago.
[01:52:14.157 --> 01:52:17.159]  They got put back to the company that paid to have them made.
[01:52:17.519 --> 01:52:22.383]  Now that I'm back in control, they shipped them back into our warehouse, and the other half are available right now.
[01:52:22.743 --> 01:52:24.844]  I would imagine they'll sell out in a month or so.
[01:52:25.645 --> 01:52:31.608]  We've only got a few thousand of these left, and I cannot fund this operation without you doing this.
[01:52:31.628 --> 01:52:32.249]  Now, I want to be clear.
[01:52:32.829 --> 01:52:35.011]  I'm not telling you to buy this as a gold investment.
[01:52:35.031 --> 01:52:35.751]  That's not what this is.
[01:52:35.771 --> 01:52:36.872]  It's a little piece of gold in there.
[01:52:37.452 --> 01:52:50.557]  This is like, on NPR, that still gives taxpayer money, they'll sell a coffee mug to cost them five dollars, or a baseball cap to cost them ten dollars, and you make a hundred dollar donation, and you get that as a memento that you supported communism and the new world order.
[01:52:50.837 --> 01:52:51.757]  I know you don't want to do that.
[01:52:52.477 --> 01:52:59.100]  This costs, I think they told me, more than ten dollars per card, something like that, ten or eleven dollars, and so the other
[01:53:00.123 --> 01:53:02.846]  $80-something will go to fund the operation.
[01:53:02.906 --> 01:53:06.049]  We need these funds to continue on in the fight.
[01:53:06.569 --> 01:53:14.257]  So, get your collectible card, your piece of art, with the little piece of gold in it, today, and you will help keep us on air.
[01:53:14.617 --> 01:53:15.718]  The decision is yours.
[01:53:15.738 --> 01:53:17.140]  This is a limited edition.
[01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:22.761]  It's something that people like, it's popular, and it's something that's collectible.
[01:53:22.801 --> 01:53:33.104]  But regardless, the real value is knowing you stood up for America at such a critical time, and myself and President Trump and others are under such massive, massive, massive levels of attack.
[01:53:33.464 --> 01:53:42.366]  So please take action now at InfoWarsTore.com and get the exclusive InfoWars limited edition proprietary 24 karat 999 pure gold collectible.
[01:53:42.746 --> 01:53:43.606]  Thank you for your support.
[01:53:43.966 --> 01:53:45.607]  Get this collectible now and help keep us on air.
[01:53:51.583 --> 01:53:54.696]  All right, we're into hour number three on this Monday, August 19, 2024 transmission.
[01:53:57.642 --> 01:54:05.984]  Hundreds of radio stations join us coming up in about six minutes, but we have this little five-minute piece that is going out on the internet and to many stations as well.
[01:54:06.444 --> 01:54:09.325]  And Dr. Robert Malone got on a little early, which we appreciate him doing.
[01:54:09.345 --> 01:54:10.185]  He's a very busy man.
[01:54:10.765 --> 01:54:15.026]  And so we're going to go right to him right now, and he'll give us a prelude of what's coming up, and we'll break it all down.
[01:54:15.046 --> 01:54:18.527]  I'm going to try to give him the floor as much as I can here today.
[01:54:18.627 --> 01:54:22.508]  He is probably the most influential and active person
[01:54:23.604 --> 01:54:36.809]  A lot of great people exposing what we've been through in the last four and a half plus years, and I really appreciate him coming on to respond to the audience's call to hear from a real expert about what's happening with the monkey pox and what's really going on.
[01:54:37.330 --> 01:54:40.231]  Now they tried a few years ago, so now they've rebranded it in pox.
[01:54:40.871 --> 01:54:44.615]  He wants to talk about disaster cronyism and psychological bioterrorism.
[01:54:45.476 --> 01:54:48.780]  Also the new book, Cywar Enforcing the New World Order.
[01:54:49.521 --> 01:54:50.121]  Hardcover.
[01:54:50.622 --> 01:54:53.385]  We're going to be talking about all of this with him.
[01:54:53.425 --> 01:54:53.926]  He sent us
[01:54:55.546 --> 01:54:56.908]  Literally hundreds of documents.
[01:54:56.968 --> 01:54:59.852]  I mean, probably over 100 articles of documents I've been given.
[01:55:00.833 --> 01:55:03.397]  So I'm going to try to, again, give him the floor.
[01:55:03.437 --> 01:55:05.059]  But just four minutes to break, sir.
[01:55:05.579 --> 01:55:07.702]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:55:08.223 --> 01:55:13.250]  Please give us a snapshot of what you're going to be talking about.
[01:55:15.051 --> 01:55:21.876]  Well, Alex, thanks a lot for having me on and I want to honor your leadership all the way through.
[01:55:22.757 --> 01:55:27.120]  It's over a decade now where you've been ahead of the curve again and again.
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:35.306]  So here we have a situation very much aligned with info wars or psychological bioterrorism or information warfare.
[01:55:36.106 --> 01:55:40.288]  And in particular right now you want to focus on the monkeypox story.
[01:55:40.388 --> 01:55:58.297]  So what's fascinating is it was just disclosed a few minutes ago by the World Health Organization that the prior monkeypox emergency declaration was set to expire tomorrow.
[01:55:59.403 --> 01:56:03.885]  Now, when they make these emergency declarations, it gives them power and money.
[01:56:04.805 --> 01:56:16.629]  And so no surprise that they have contrived to come out with yet another monkeypox emergency declaration two days before, literally, before the last one expired.
[01:56:16.649 --> 01:56:26.333]  So this is a lot like the gamesmanship that's been done by the Biden administration regarding the declaration of emergency for COVID.
[01:56:27.382 --> 01:56:38.753]  And the truth is that what we've got here going on in the Democratic Republic of Congo or the Congo Basin is something that's been going on for a few years.
[01:56:38.853 --> 01:56:46.921]  There's nothing particularly unusual here except for they're detecting more cases in surrounding countries.
[01:56:47.601 --> 01:56:50.644]  But this is still a variant
[01:56:51.425 --> 01:57:08.911]  Played 1B is what it's called, and there's some concern that it may be more infectious, but it's still restricted to basically men who have sex with men, prostitutes and others that are in contact with men who have sex with men that have developed cases of monkeypox.
[01:57:09.492 --> 01:57:18.635]  This is readily controlled, as the prior outbreak was, by just public education and getting people to, say, gently modify their behavior.
[01:57:19.575 --> 01:57:22.557]  This is not an international concern.
[01:57:22.577 --> 01:57:30.783]  It doesn't merit this, except for from the perspective of the leadership of the WHO, this gives them more power and money.
[01:57:31.464 --> 01:57:48.536]  And it also supports the interests of Moderna, which is trying to come out with a new vaccine, and Bavarian Nordic, which has already seen a huge pop in their stock price because they market the currently available smallpox vaccine that's been repurposed for monkeypox.
[01:57:49.036 --> 01:57:49.756]  Incredible.
[01:57:50.117 --> 01:57:50.477]  Incredible.
[01:57:50.517 --> 01:57:51.177]  So stay right there.
[01:57:51.257 --> 01:57:51.918]  Recap that.
[01:57:52.698 --> 01:57:53.939]  And you're gracious to be here, sir.
[01:57:54.039 --> 01:57:55.780]  Please just go through that again.
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:56.940]  And I didn't even know that.
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:00.022]  I remember them declaring the monkeypox emergency a few years ago.
[01:58:00.882 --> 01:58:06.325]  Now they changed the name a few days before issuing a new emergency to again give themselves more power.
[01:58:06.785 --> 01:58:07.085]  Wow.
[01:58:07.205 --> 01:58:09.126]  This is so incredible.
[01:58:09.166 --> 01:58:10.227]  Learning a lot already.
[01:58:10.267 --> 01:58:11.848]  Just a few minutes with Dr. Robert Malone.
[01:58:12.288 --> 01:58:17.334]  Be sure and follow him on X. We'll put that on screen and give that out on air.
[01:58:17.695 --> 01:58:18.536]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:18.776 --> 01:58:21.799]  RW Malone, MD on X. We'll be right back.
[01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:28.327]  All right, we could not have a more informed scientist on with us who understands the science.
[01:58:29.785 --> 01:58:32.668]  The politics, the psychology, the Dr. Robert Malone.
[01:58:33.689 --> 01:58:40.496]  Be sure and follow him on X for incredible information at rwmalonemd or just type in Robert Malone, Dr. Robert Malone.
[01:58:40.896 --> 01:58:41.517]  You can't miss it.
[01:58:41.537 --> 01:58:43.679]  He sent us a lot of documents, a lot of research.
[01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:46.401]  A lot of information, a huge folder.
[01:58:46.441 --> 01:58:49.802]  My crew gave me two other big folders and he just dropped a bombshell.
[01:58:49.842 --> 01:58:51.303]  He just joined us in the last little segment.
[01:58:51.863 --> 01:58:52.944]  I didn't even think about this.
[01:58:53.904 --> 01:59:02.028]  Several years ago, the UN declared its last monkeypox emergency that was set to expire here in a few days and right back to have all their emergency powers.
[01:59:02.048 --> 01:59:02.488]  They're here.
[01:59:02.928 --> 01:59:04.229]  They want to try to still ram through.
[01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:06.130]  Their pandemic treaty.
[01:59:06.150 --> 01:59:13.699]  We have all these chilling statements from Eric Schmidt with all the AI systems saying we want to censor people that question things.
[01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:15.141]  We want to use NATO.
[01:59:15.822 --> 01:59:19.847]  We have Hotez saying use NATO to censor and troops UN.
[01:59:20.668 --> 01:59:22.530]  We have Democrats talking about this.
[01:59:23.371 --> 01:59:26.073]  We have England arresting political dissidents for their speech.
[01:59:26.193 --> 01:59:28.114]  I mean, this is real totalitarianism.
[01:59:28.454 --> 01:59:29.575]  Then we have the bird flu.
[01:59:29.615 --> 01:59:30.655]  What's really happening with that?
[01:59:30.675 --> 01:59:32.716]  This emergency declaration.
[01:59:32.776 --> 01:59:35.838]  These new mRNA vaccines getting emergency approval.
[01:59:36.599 --> 01:59:40.681]  Dr. Malone, recap what you said for some stations that weren't carrying us, and then please continue.
[01:59:42.890 --> 01:59:54.854]  So the breaking news, as you just recapped Alex, is that, and this is literally just out in the last few minutes, I've been tracking this because Alex and his team asked me to speak about monkeypox today.
[01:59:55.494 --> 02:00:05.278]  And so I did a review of the current status of monkeypox and posted that on our substack as mpox slash monkeypox summer 2024 update.
[02:00:06.998 --> 02:00:24.478]  And just after posting that update of the current status and science and medical stance position right now in terms of monkeypox and particularly the clade 1b is what is being used for the latest round of fear.
[02:00:25.699 --> 02:00:29.103]  That is emanating from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
[02:00:29.203 --> 02:00:30.585]  So this is the deep Congo.
[02:00:31.165 --> 02:00:35.210]  And by the way, monkeypox is a zoonotic infection.
[02:00:35.871 --> 02:00:38.134]  It's endemic in the DRC.
[02:00:38.154 --> 02:00:43.320]  It exists in a variety of animal reservoirs, one of which, of course, is monkeys.
[02:00:44.501 --> 02:00:47.402]  And we're never going to eradicate monkeypox.
[02:00:47.462 --> 02:00:51.325]  There seems to be a genetic variant circulating.
[02:00:51.385 --> 02:00:53.426]  It's unclear how long it's been circulating.
[02:00:53.807 --> 02:01:02.252]  Might have been at least two years that may be somewhat more infectious in the susceptible population of individuals.
[02:01:02.312 --> 02:01:05.014]  Who's the susceptible population of individuals?
[02:01:05.494 --> 02:01:11.378]  Well, basically across the board, if you look at, for instance, the Pasteur Institute and
[02:01:11.898 --> 02:01:14.962]  Virtually all other responsible public health authorities.
[02:01:15.523 --> 02:01:28.680]  The people that are at risk for monkeypox are men who have sex with men, prostitutes, and others that are in close contact with men who have sex with men who become infected by monkeypox.
[02:01:29.301 --> 02:01:40.287]  You are not at risk if you're not somebody who has sex with men or, you know, a man who has sex with men or in close contact with those individuals.
[02:01:40.828 --> 02:01:51.373]  And another thing, all of the fear that stoked around this, you would think that this is essentially Ebola 2.0, that if you get monkey pox, it's going to kill you like smallpox.
[02:01:51.434 --> 02:01:52.514]  That's not true.
[02:01:53.014 --> 02:01:55.416]  Again and again and again, the statements from
[02:01:56.276 --> 02:02:07.039]  A leading, well-recognized public health experts across the world, except for those that are busy promoting fear porn, is that this is not a lethal infection.
[02:02:07.079 --> 02:02:15.141]  There's a small number of cases in the DRC, perhaps 500 cases in the DRC of people that have died with
[02:02:24.544 --> 02:02:43.831]  Monkeypox, and this is very much alike to the situation with the COVID coronavirus, where they mix up people that were infected with COVID at the time that they died with actually COVID causing those deaths.
[02:02:43.951 --> 02:02:52.915]  You know, this is, as I said so long ago on Joe Rogan, if somebody comes into Chicago Hospital with a gunshot wound to the head and they manage to get a positive PCR,
[02:02:53.775 --> 02:02:56.438]  They attribute his death to COVID.
[02:02:56.818 --> 02:02:58.660]  Same situation with monkeypox.
[02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:04.226]  So the total of 500 cases, maybe, that's disputed.
[02:03:04.246 --> 02:03:05.367]  The Pasteur says about 150.
[02:03:07.479 --> 02:03:11.660]  Over the last few years of death from monkeypox, this is not going to kill you.
[02:03:13.061 --> 02:03:26.005]  And it's readily controlled by behavioral modification and the repurposed vaccine that exists from the Belgian company Bavarian Nordic that was originally designed for smallpox.
[02:03:27.746 --> 02:03:32.630]  It has a partial effect on clade 2 monkeypox.
[02:03:33.071 --> 02:03:45.261]  We don't know if it's effective against clade 1 monkeypox, but the stock valuation of Bavarian Nordic is going through the roof and Moderna has a new vaccine and testing, etc, etc.
[02:03:46.722 --> 02:03:53.445]  And then the kicker was, well, you know, why are they suddenly ramping up the fear porn just now?
[02:03:54.226 --> 02:04:01.029]  And yeah, it's exactly, it's MSMs that are responsible for this.
[02:04:01.089 --> 02:04:02.430]  Why are they ramping it up right now?
[02:04:02.530 --> 02:04:12.215]  Just disclosed just shortly before our broadcast today was that their prior emergency declaration
[02:04:13.416 --> 02:04:19.202]  Of pandemic global pandemic concern was set to expire on the 20th ergo tomorrow.
[02:04:20.103 --> 02:04:25.610]  And so if that expires, then they would lose the additional funding and powers that they get.
[02:04:26.249 --> 02:04:29.410]  through the international health regulations.
[02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:37.112]  This is one of these things they've been fighting over together with the new pandemic treaty quote-unquote to get still additional powers.
[02:04:37.433 --> 02:04:51.477]  Well those powers would have expired tomorrow and so no surprise they've come out with this new announcement after convening a literally a zoom meeting a couple of days ago with 15 or 16 people that they've hand selected
[02:04:52.218 --> 02:05:01.953]  Who all agreed unanimously that this needs to be re-upped, that we need to have yet another declaration of
[02:05:03.366 --> 02:05:19.517]  A public health global public health concern associated with monkeypox on the basis of these little fragments of data having to do with clade 1b that's circulating in the DRC.
[02:05:19.977 --> 02:05:21.438]  So that's that's what's going on.
[02:05:21.478 --> 02:05:32.766]  This is another power play and that leads into disaster capitalism as Naomi Klein calls it or the disaster cronyism because I refuse to call this capitalism.
[02:05:33.647 --> 02:05:49.347]  And this process that was disclosed in 2017 by a former SVR Russian intelligence agent now based in New Zealand,
[02:05:49.987 --> 02:06:06.516]  That he called information bioterrorism and he laid out a series of steps that are well-known spycraft throughout the world to basically exploit the fear of infectious disease for a variety of purposes, financial power and otherwise.
[02:06:07.096 --> 02:06:14.620]  And we're basically right along the same script that was deployed for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID.
[02:06:15.761 --> 02:06:21.827]  And now being actively deployed in a second round for monkeypox.
[02:06:22.087 --> 02:06:27.672]  And of course, exactly what we saw play out with avian influenza.
[02:06:28.193 --> 02:06:37.342]  But unfortunately, in the case of avian influenza, the actual science hasn't fit with their model for how
[02:06:39.580 --> 02:06:44.482]  How to play one of these psychological bioterrorism events.
[02:06:45.603 --> 02:06:47.904]  And so it appears that they've had to kind of pivot.
[02:06:47.944 --> 02:06:49.885]  Now, does this have anything to do with the election?
[02:06:51.006 --> 02:06:53.067]  Your speculation is as good as mine.
[02:06:53.127 --> 02:06:57.189]  We'll see what they do with this over the next few months.
[02:06:57.349 --> 02:06:59.470]  But there's no question in my mind.
[02:07:00.190 --> 02:07:12.895]  That this, quote, emergency declaration that has been made by the World Health Organization is yet another example of disaster cronyism and psychological bioterrorism on the part of Tedros.
[02:07:13.815 --> 02:07:19.657]  And his kind of alarmism isn't even mirrored by his own internal people that are on the ground.
[02:07:20.497 --> 02:07:21.818]  And Dr. Fitzgerald, briefly.
[02:07:38.090 --> 02:07:39.771]  What you're saying is totally prima facie.
[02:07:39.791 --> 02:07:40.451]  It's on its face.
[02:07:41.051 --> 02:08:05.301]  You sent me literally three huge stacks of documents here, and I don't know which, which, you know, angle you want to go, because there's so much, everything you're saying, you sent me the reports, the studies, the proof, because as you're speaking, I'm looking at it, seeing it here, but I'm not a rocket scientist, but if they admit that 99% in UN studies, WHO, CDC, British studies, 99% are homosexual or bisexual men who have all these partners, they're doing really, you know, dangerous things,
[02:08:06.121 --> 02:08:09.104]  And then they're fear-mongering it like the end of the world.
[02:08:09.625 --> 02:08:15.430]  Right as their last emergency declaration for monkeypox goes away, they rebrand it as mpox.
[02:08:16.091 --> 02:08:18.153]  I mean, this is just incredibly transparent.
[02:08:18.874 --> 02:08:23.879]  And as you said, the medical literature says not a danger basically to anybody except for lifestyle.
[02:08:24.379 --> 02:08:27.422]  And then when you turn on the national news, they go, it's not a gay thing.
[02:08:27.783 --> 02:08:28.984]  It's actually super deadly.
[02:08:29.244 --> 02:08:35.786]  And then they had this drill two years ago that these governments put on where tens of millions die from the monkeypox.
[02:08:35.806 --> 02:08:37.927]  I mean, none of it makes sense when you're looking at it.
[02:08:37.987 --> 02:08:42.748]  It's three years ago, just to correct you, sorry, but you're exactly right.
[02:08:42.788 --> 02:08:49.871]  This was another agenda, I'm sorry, just as occurred with the COVID crisis.
[02:08:50.991 --> 02:08:52.011]  Sure, so I just said a lot.
[02:08:52.091 --> 02:08:53.372]  Unpack that because you're the expert.
[02:08:54.955 --> 02:09:13.423]  So, there absolutely was another one of these war games that played out in Germany three years ago, exactly one year almost to the day before the prior, quote, outbreak that was associated with the largest gay rave party in the world.
[02:09:14.784 --> 02:09:32.055]  And no surprise when Monkeypox was, let's say, somehow entered that population in the midst of that gay rave party, it suddenly spread explosively all over the world in those populations that engage in those practices.
[02:09:32.716 --> 02:09:38.840]  So that was anticipated literally.
[02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:54.232]  Precisely a year prior in a war game that was held in Germany, much as Event 201 amazingly precisely anticipated the events of the COVID crisis.
[02:09:55.112 --> 02:09:57.734]  And this gets to Kozmov's thesis.
[02:09:58.635 --> 02:10:00.477]  And he gave this interview in 2017.
[02:10:03.039 --> 02:10:16.351]  To a New Zealand journal, and this was following on the prior bird flu outbreak and fear porn campaign that some of you may remember.
[02:10:17.192 --> 02:10:26.600]  And he basically laid out a series of steps and rules that are used to wind up this kind of fear.
[02:10:27.601 --> 02:10:35.945]  And exploit it for other purposes, typically economic power, political disruption, etc.
[02:10:36.305 --> 02:10:42.007]  That this is basically well-known spycraft that is just being followed to the letter again and again.
[02:10:42.027 --> 02:10:50.291]  And then we have the whole history of Mr. Tedros, who has deep roots essentially in African terrorism.
[02:10:53.312 --> 02:11:10.899]  And in close connections with Bill Gates and with the CCP, who has been placed in this position and then had his position renewed by acclamation, no actual vote, of Director General of the World Health Organization.
[02:11:10.999 --> 02:11:14.600]  And I assert that he is clearly, explicitly,
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:29.088]  Engaging in psychological bioterrorism, the weaponization of fear of infectious disease as an existential crisis in order to affect various political and financial and power objectives.
[02:11:29.628 --> 02:11:31.509]  That is what he does routinely.
[02:11:32.069 --> 02:11:34.410]  Psychological bioterrorism is wrong.
[02:11:34.731 --> 02:11:35.791]  It's clearly wrong.
[02:11:35.891 --> 02:11:42.935]  It's clearly unethical, and it's clearly practiced on a routine basis by the current Director General of the World Health Organization.
[02:11:44.906 --> 02:11:46.507]  Please continue elaborating on that.
[02:11:48.589 --> 02:12:01.298]  So, psychological bioterrorism is the weaponization of fear associated with infectious diseases, and it's typically irrational fear.
[02:12:01.619 --> 02:12:02.860]  It's the fear of death.
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:13.748]  This is one of the most powerful means of manipulating individuals psychologically, is to confront them with the fear of death.
[02:12:14.605 --> 02:12:30.133]  And that is what was used all the way through the COVID crisis in order to promote these various policies that no one can dispute resulted in the most massive upward transfer of wealth in modern history.
[02:12:31.255 --> 02:12:44.433]  And the promotion of a variety of different outcomes, which we describe at length in this new book that's going to come out on the 8th from Skyhorse Publishing, called Cywarp, Enforcing the New World Order.
[02:12:46.415 --> 02:12:59.109]  And this is right in line with the InfoWars core thesis that you, Alex, have been talking about for decades now, that we are being subjected to information warfare.
[02:12:59.189 --> 02:13:02.793]  That is what psychological warfare or fifth-generation warfare is.
[02:13:03.974 --> 02:13:21.340]  And this is now come to a stage of development in which yes Rockefeller is at the core of this historically but this is come to a stage of advanced development as a technology platform that it can is able to control all information.
[02:13:22.676 --> 02:13:28.118]  And your feelings, your belief systems, your very thoughts.
[02:13:28.998 --> 02:13:39.561]  And it interfaces with this other important technological advance and business advance, which is often referred to now as surveillance capitalism.
[02:13:39.601 --> 02:13:49.384]  This is the business model that drives Google, Facebook, Amazon, and all of social media in which your thoughts, feelings, emotions, etc.
[02:13:49.504 --> 02:13:50.384]  are extracted.
[02:13:51.164 --> 02:14:04.549]  From all of your online activities what you say what you think what you click on it's extracted and then reformulated without your permission into behavioral futures.
[02:14:05.319 --> 02:14:13.001]  That are then sold, and they are sold, among other things, to various political organizations, etc.
[02:14:13.021 --> 02:14:18.863]  I mean, we saw this play out with the prior campaigns, and it's playing out in abundance with the current one.
[02:14:19.443 --> 02:14:24.085]  And then they use that information, whether it's to sell you soap or cars,
[02:14:25.405 --> 02:14:36.451]  Or politicians or policies such as central bank digital currency and all of the trappings associated with this new world order that's being promoted.
[02:14:37.091 --> 02:14:51.539]  And so what you have is this loop in which they're extracting your belief system your thoughts and feelings and then using that to manipulate you psychologically because they know what your hot buttons are.
[02:14:51.559 --> 02:14:53.200]  Mr. Dr. Epstein.
[02:14:55.201 --> 02:15:10.858]  Has documented this quite well in the case of Google, where he's been able to clearly demonstrate that for an undecided voter, Google is able to swing the voting behavior
[02:15:11.738 --> 02:15:24.586]  Of an undecided voter by 20 points through their algorithmic selection of what they present to you when you when you click on to the browser or make various inquiries.
[02:15:25.027 --> 02:15:32.652]  This is the same tech they used to sell you all these other things and it's all based on the ability to extract.
[02:15:33.567 --> 02:15:44.679]  Your emotions and thoughts and belief systems and then repackage it and sell it to third parties that want to use it for whatever it is that their objectives are.
[02:15:44.759 --> 02:15:47.602]  So that's that's this do loop that's happening now.
[02:15:48.363 --> 02:15:52.707]  And one of the most powerful tools in the weaponry.
[02:15:53.528 --> 02:15:57.030]  Or psychological manipulation of individuals is the fear of death.
[02:15:57.130 --> 02:15:59.051]  This is one of our most powerful fears.
[02:15:59.731 --> 02:16:07.616]  And so the fear of death can easily be used or weaponized by linking it to infectious disease.
[02:16:08.376 --> 02:16:10.657]  And that's what's being done on a routine basis.
[02:16:10.717 --> 02:16:14.619]  That's what Cosimov taught us about in terms of spy craft.
[02:16:15.140 --> 02:16:21.003]  And that's what we're seeing on play out on a routine basis right now in real time.
[02:16:21.563 --> 02:16:32.365]  With all the events that we've seen with the COVID crisis, what's been done with avian influenza, what's now being done with monkeypox, and so many other things.
[02:16:32.625 --> 02:16:35.286]  Climate, anthropomorphic climate change.
[02:16:35.306 --> 02:16:44.948]  I mean, we're just seeing layers and layers of the utilization of weaponized fear in order to psychologically manipulate people.
[02:16:45.236 --> 02:16:45.936]  I want you to continue.
[02:16:45.976 --> 02:16:52.840]  You want to talk about how you think you counter this, but everything you're saying for new viewers is on record in Canada, in the U.S., in the U.K., in Europe.
[02:16:53.460 --> 02:17:02.584]  They ran headlines later, a year later, when they started all this saying, oh, the military helped terrorize the public using psychological warfare with the media to make you stay in and make you take your shots.
[02:17:03.125 --> 02:17:04.665]  Then they lied and said the shots were good.
[02:17:04.786 --> 02:17:05.566]  That was all a lie.
[02:17:05.586 --> 02:17:09.108]  I mean, this is beyond just trying to extract our minds and our money.
[02:17:09.548 --> 02:17:11.069]  They want to control the whole economy.
[02:17:12.119 --> 02:17:14.822]  For social engineering, and I didn't look in a crystal ball.
[02:17:14.942 --> 02:17:21.228]  I was reading Operation Lockstep 14 years ago from the Rockefeller Foundation, saying they would do all this.
[02:17:21.328 --> 02:17:23.230]  I was reading the books written by them.
[02:17:24.111 --> 02:17:25.592]  Lou Dobbs got the secret documents.
[02:17:25.632 --> 02:17:28.815]  Judicial Watch did in 2006, where they met in Banff, Canada.
[02:17:28.855 --> 02:17:32.038]  They said, we're going to use a virus scare to bring in world government.
[02:17:32.419 --> 02:17:37.383]  I mean, that's where the Achilles heel, though, is they talk about us like we're little kids at the
[02:17:38.244 --> 02:17:42.347]  At the little kid table at Thanksgiving, and they're the big kids, the adults.
[02:17:42.707 --> 02:17:44.729]  I mean, they just basically admit all this stuff.
[02:17:45.009 --> 02:17:46.490]  Now, in the pop culture, they don't.
[02:17:46.510 --> 02:17:47.471]  They put the lies out.
[02:17:47.711 --> 02:17:50.173]  But the fine print, they talk about us like we're animals.
[02:17:50.573 --> 02:17:53.435]  And for me, it's so frustrating to see this happening.
[02:17:53.455 --> 02:17:55.997]  But thank God, real professionals, real scientists,
[02:17:56.417 --> 02:18:02.980]  I mean, the who's who of real scientists have come out by the tens of thousands, despite the persecution, and stood against this.
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:16.206]  So as negative and depressing as this all is, before we get back into more of this and solutions and some of the other things that are happening, all these new studies about the sole cause of the increased heart failure is the shots in these big studies.
[02:18:16.586 --> 02:18:16.686]  Yeah.
[02:18:18.247 --> 02:18:20.049]  I think this didn't go as well as they wanted.
[02:18:20.169 --> 02:18:25.416]  I think they've had, in fact, I know they have been really overplayed their hand.
[02:18:25.436 --> 02:18:26.237]  Do you agree with that?
[02:18:26.377 --> 02:18:28.500]  And how would you describe it?
[02:18:30.154 --> 02:18:43.424]  Well, they have overplayed their hand, and I've heard through back channels that some bleeding people, even in the Gates Foundation, have had cardiac damage and other adverse events associated with these products.
[02:18:43.964 --> 02:18:44.344]  Wow.
[02:18:44.585 --> 02:18:48.988]  And so there's an... forgive me, somebody is pestering me.
[02:18:49.188 --> 02:18:49.929]  I understand how it is.
[02:18:51.534 --> 02:19:12.354]  But the use of this infectious disease event, which was grossly overplayed, and that's now documented quite well, has compromised public trust in health.
[02:19:14.870 --> 02:19:24.936]  In medicine, in government, all across the world, it's played a major role in the rise of these populist movements, particularly throughout the Western nations.
[02:19:25.796 --> 02:19:34.021]  And they haven't reached critical mass yet because, in part, because these technologies for manipulating public opinion
[02:19:34.961 --> 02:19:36.522]  And public behavior.
[02:19:37.102 --> 02:19:40.604]  But the anger is just building and building and building.
[02:19:41.385 --> 02:19:51.090]  And we saw an outbreak of that recently, an expression of it in the UK under Starmer, as you noted in your opening here.
[02:19:52.490 --> 02:19:59.814]  And they have successfully suppressed that through arrests for
[02:20:01.531 --> 02:20:10.662]  Facebook and other social media crimes having to do with just reposting information about those protests and those riots that occurred.
[02:20:11.283 --> 02:20:12.804]  This is not going to be sustainable.
[02:20:13.903 --> 02:20:31.632]  And and that's that's where we're at is all of this is coming to a head and it's becoming increasingly not just totalitarian but authoritarian and backed by really power.
[02:20:32.390 --> 02:20:33.811]  And debanking and everything else.
[02:20:33.831 --> 02:20:34.951]  Stay right there.
[02:20:53.180 --> 02:20:55.182]  And again, this whole thing is surveilling us.
[02:20:55.243 --> 02:20:56.644]  Yeah, it sells us soap and cars.
[02:20:57.065 --> 02:20:59.788]  It also sells us shots that give us cancer and cause heart attacks.
[02:21:00.208 --> 02:21:04.954]  And then they try to ban and block and persecute scientists that have exposed it and been vindicated.
[02:21:05.234 --> 02:21:06.456]  Dr. Robert Malone is our guest.
[02:21:06.516 --> 02:21:07.277]  Back in four minutes.
[02:21:07.799 --> 02:21:08.800]  How's it going, Harrison?
[02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:10.181]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:21:10.201 --> 02:21:11.642]  You guys have the best crew.
[02:21:11.942 --> 02:21:13.123]  You guys are awesome.
[02:21:13.203 --> 02:21:14.565]  Just wanted to plug real quick.
[02:21:14.765 --> 02:21:21.810]  Just recently found out after 14 years, I got a quarter or half my muscle torn off from my shoulder blade.
[02:21:22.131 --> 02:21:22.451]  Right?
[02:21:22.471 --> 02:21:24.673]  So I've been in constant pain for years.
[02:21:25.133 --> 02:21:29.957]  And the turmeric, the nitric boost, the fish oil, everything.
[02:21:30.237 --> 02:21:34.019]  If I don't take it, dude, I'm totally feeling it and I'm on the floor.
[02:21:34.119 --> 02:21:38.241]  This is one of the only things is your products that gets me going.
[02:21:38.401 --> 02:21:41.803]  It's helping me and I've been in pain for 14 years.
[02:21:42.123 --> 02:21:43.684]  You guys gotta try some of it.
[02:21:43.924 --> 02:21:44.224]  Wow.
[02:21:44.564 --> 02:21:45.285]  It's true, folks.
[02:21:45.325 --> 02:21:47.186]  You hear people call in like this all the time.
[02:21:47.666 --> 02:21:53.910]  These products are life-changing if you take them as directed, especially combined with exercise and a good diet.
[02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:58.353]  Things like Bodies, the Turmeric Supplement, Turmeric 95 from InfoWarsMD.
[02:21:58.793 --> 02:22:02.435]  Incredibly powerful, life-changing stuff at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:22:02.455 --> 02:22:03.076]  Thanks for the call, Drew.
[02:22:16.835 --> 02:22:17.656]  We're unbalanced!
[02:22:17.936 --> 02:22:18.916]  It's not fair!
[02:22:24.020 --> 02:22:27.622]  I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires.
[02:22:28.062 --> 02:22:36.148]  We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong in dark rooms glued to their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials.
[02:22:36.588 --> 02:22:40.190]  Well, I think... NBC, you are here to listen and not speak.
[02:22:41.571 --> 02:22:43.493]  I think we should go with the good old-fashioned public health care.
[02:22:43.733 --> 02:22:43.913]  Yeah.
[02:22:45.276 --> 02:22:45.936]  A new disease.
[02:22:46.177 --> 02:22:46.817]  No one's immune.
[02:22:47.137 --> 02:22:50.399]  It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic.
[02:22:50.579 --> 02:22:52.281]  And instead of summer, it's all the time!
[02:22:52.961 --> 02:22:57.044]  Now, I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves.
[02:22:57.084 --> 02:22:58.745]  He loves being that guy.
[02:22:58.825 --> 02:23:01.286]  But, Janice, we do have standards.
[02:23:01.486 --> 02:23:03.208]  This can't be a made-up disease.
[02:23:03.448 --> 02:23:07.771]  The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.
[02:23:07.951 --> 02:23:11.353]  We do have something we've been holding on to, but it hasn't been tested.
[02:23:11.713 --> 02:23:12.614]  Get over here, NBC.
[02:23:14.796 --> 02:23:18.240]  Well, we certainly believe in testing, but I... Oh.
[02:23:20.663 --> 02:23:20.943]  Wow.
[02:23:21.644 --> 02:23:21.924]  Wow.
[02:23:22.204 --> 02:23:23.085]  Oh, yeah.
[02:23:23.125 --> 02:23:24.847]  So, we've got our deadly disease.
[02:23:25.248 --> 02:23:29.512]  Now we just have to blame it on something that's in every household.
[02:23:29.692 --> 02:23:32.075]  Something that people are a little bit afraid of already.
[02:23:32.478 --> 02:23:34.759]  House cat flu is coming, people.
[02:23:34.779 --> 02:23:42.441]  The Center for Disease Disinformation predicts with some degree of probability that the house cat flu might spread in the following hypothetical outbreak pattern.
[02:23:44.141 --> 02:23:49.742]  So petter beware, that warm body on your lap just might be ready to destroy your tender vittles.
[02:23:56.215 --> 02:24:00.856]  Springfielders are advised to stay tuned for more information if they experience any of the following symptoms.
[02:24:01.116 --> 02:24:04.137]  Mild thirst, occasional hunger, tiredness at night.
[02:24:05.678 --> 02:24:08.799]  You know, I don't know when this was ever a good idea.
[02:24:08.819 --> 02:24:18.662]  Hurry up, boy!
[02:24:18.762 --> 02:24:23.363]  We have to burn everything the cat touched before the virus makes us paranoid!
[02:24:27.878 --> 02:24:33.162]  Dr. Robert Malone is our guest, and my biggest frustration is also my biggest hope.
[02:24:34.143 --> 02:24:54.099]  If I can go read these books and white papers written by these mad scientists, and I know where it all came from, with the Austrian and Hungarian Empire and the British Empire 200 years ago, roughly, saying science is the future, we want to use it for total control, and then they just have been funding all these scientists and mad scientists, mixing in a bunch of eugenics,
[02:24:55.080 --> 02:25:05.122]  World views and now you've got you've all Noah Harari and all the Bill Gates saying the future is not human and we need to just get rid of this human culture and people are worthless.
[02:25:06.142 --> 02:25:06.942]  It's a nightmare.
[02:25:07.023 --> 02:25:12.984]  They are trying to take control of our evolution to create a new super sapien in their own words.
[02:25:13.444 --> 02:25:15.844]  We need to organize and say you're not taking control of our lives.
[02:25:16.164 --> 02:25:19.205]  This is beyond slavery and that's their master plan.
[02:25:19.225 --> 02:25:21.466]  So doctor your new book is coming out very very soon.
[02:25:21.506 --> 02:25:22.766]  I can't wait to read it.
[02:25:24.588 --> 02:25:33.153]  You can speak to the book now, or you can finish up with Solutions, which I think the book is a big part of, Psywar, psychological war, enforcing the New World Order.
[02:25:33.393 --> 02:25:34.714]  Where would you like to start this segment?
[02:25:36.823 --> 02:25:40.284]  Well, let's just launch since this is what you've got up on the screen.
[02:25:41.144 --> 02:25:47.226]  The book is intended as a tool basically to help you protect yourself.
[02:25:47.966 --> 02:26:01.911]  By understanding the methods and technologies and the why of the deployment of these methods on all of us, what I hope is that I can help those that are awake and listening.
[02:26:02.691 --> 02:26:09.995]  To become much more resistant to these technologies, just the same as the whoever you are now.
[02:26:11.435 --> 02:26:19.039]  Whenever you were born, you remember back when you were young, you were much more vulnerable to marketing technologies.
[02:26:19.179 --> 02:26:26.103]  Marketing is the kissing cousin to these kinds of psychological manipulations.
[02:26:27.123 --> 02:26:37.391]  And by learning how they do it, why they do it, how it's deployed, I'm hoping that you will become much more resistant to this.
[02:26:37.491 --> 02:26:44.036]  It's essentially armor for your mind, is the way one reviewer described it.
[02:26:45.076 --> 02:26:54.459]  So that's the general purpose of the book, is to help you to be better prepared and more resistant for these various psychological manipulation techniques.
[02:26:54.939 --> 02:27:00.421]  But Alex, I want to, you seem to be, you know, we must be resonating somehow.
[02:27:01.601 --> 02:27:22.871]  I'm just back from lecturing at the Liberty Forum in Silicon Valley on psychological warfare and these things like surveillance capitalism that are going on, and one of the hot topics there among those that I spoke with, had dinner with, etc., is the upcoming
[02:27:25.054 --> 02:27:42.300]  event associated with the development of artificial intelligence beyond a point in which the A.I.s and general A.I.s will become essentially much more intelligent than the likes of all of us as human beings.
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:43.501]  And what does that mean?
[02:27:44.338 --> 02:28:01.883]  What is really behind that and the logic that Elon Musk thinks he's going to have a deployable AI empowered robots within the next couple of years at a $20,000 price point for all of us who don't want to wash the dishes or vacuum the carpet?
[02:28:03.183 --> 02:28:07.406]  It also relates to the use of drones in warfare.
[02:28:07.466 --> 02:28:16.752]  They're now deploying artificial intelligence into drones, making them autonomous so they can't be disrupted by blocking satellite communications, etc.
[02:28:17.928 --> 02:28:21.531]  Uh, and giving them the power to make kill decisions autonomously.
[02:28:21.571 --> 02:28:25.274]  This technology is clearly being pioneered in the Ukraine right now.
[02:28:25.755 --> 02:28:37.485]  That's probably part of why the whole thrust in Ukraine is to further develop artificial intelligence in the surrounding weaponry as additional tools of war for the U.S.
[02:28:37.565 --> 02:28:38.646]  military and NATO.
[02:28:39.406 --> 02:28:52.811]  So we're moving to a world, as you point out, where the WEF, or the leadership within the WEF, or the thousand largest companies in the world, or however you want to express that cabal that exists.
[02:28:52.851 --> 02:28:54.172]  There's no question it exists.
[02:28:55.553 --> 02:28:57.515]  What, how are they seeing the world?
[02:28:57.535 --> 02:28:59.857]  Yuval Harari gives us a window into that.
[02:29:00.598 --> 02:29:10.849]  And it seems to be that they are buying into, many within Silicon Valley are buying into the thesis that the human species is obsolete.
[02:29:11.169 --> 02:29:15.494]  That we've done a bad job of taking care of our stewardship of the globe.
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:31.065]  And that it's a good idea to replace humankind with a human-machine or purely machine fusion in a world in which we'll upload our avatars, etc.
[02:29:31.765 --> 02:29:37.086]  And that may be what's driving some of this right now.
[02:29:37.166 --> 02:29:44.889]  I used to be very wary about talking about depopulation agendas until I read the Kissinger Report and saw it in black and white.
[02:29:47.270 --> 02:30:10.486]  We are moving into a situation within the next couple of years in which these very large corporations, or virtually anybody who has significant manufacturing capacity, can produce incredibly powerful weaponry, that being weaponized drones run by artificial intelligence, and basically field their own armies.
[02:30:11.266 --> 02:30:12.808]  That's that's where we're heading.
[02:30:13.148 --> 02:30:24.280]  And the belief is apparently that, you know, we hear these words like useless eaters, but a large part of the human population will be redundant.
[02:30:25.174 --> 02:30:25.995]  It's not needed.
[02:30:27.155 --> 02:30:30.858]  It's not necessary in order to contribute to economic activity.
[02:30:31.699 --> 02:30:35.201]  Much of the manufacturing capacity will become fully autonomous.
[02:30:35.962 --> 02:30:38.364]  And what are you going to do with all those folks?
[02:30:38.444 --> 02:30:46.149]  Well, somehow you've got a bridge from here to there, and you've got to reduce the population because it's going to be unnecessary.
[02:30:47.310 --> 02:30:51.253]  And furthermore, it's increasingly perceived as redundant.
[02:30:51.986 --> 02:31:19.482]  That humankind is has really not contributing or won't is anticipated to not contribute to this new future driven by machines that are more capable of processing information than the likes of you and I. And where what's really behind this is the belief that what makes us human is our cognition.
[02:31:19.562 --> 02:31:20.803]  It's our ability to think.
[02:31:21.616 --> 02:31:22.617]  But that's not true.
[02:31:23.497 --> 02:31:26.559]  All of us know in our hearts that that's not the case.
[02:31:26.619 --> 02:31:28.421]  There's something else called the soul.
[02:31:29.441 --> 02:31:31.963]  And artificial intelligence doesn't have soul.
[02:31:32.744 --> 02:31:44.712]  It's what that is really what makes us human is things like soul and love and companionship and community.
[02:31:45.584 --> 02:32:00.051]  And they may think, because they live in a world that's often psychopathic, where they're narcissistic and they're surrounded by other narcissists, and they don't really care about other human beings, they don't find them necessary.
[02:32:00.071 --> 02:32:04.593]  This is the classical computer scientist stereotype.
[02:32:06.274 --> 02:32:18.944]  And I think that, for instance, Bill Gates, just to take a person, very much embodies this kind of psychological state in which it's all about Bill and the rest of us are largely unnecessary.
[02:32:19.064 --> 02:32:19.945]  He's an archetype.
[02:32:20.665 --> 02:32:22.047]  Things to be manipulated.
[02:32:23.228 --> 02:32:23.548]  You're right.
[02:32:23.568 --> 02:32:26.250]  Just to add something here, I want you to finish your point, but this is key.
[02:32:27.291 --> 02:32:30.073]  I've studied the different arms of this.
[02:32:30.273 --> 02:32:32.055]  There's a lot of arms, but the two main ones are
[02:32:33.513 --> 02:32:38.357]  Kind of a Theodore Kaczynski type globalist elite, and they kind of have both philosophies at the same time.
[02:32:38.377 --> 02:32:51.407]  They're creating a dialectic, a Hegelian synthesis of this, that think AI is too dangerous and the technology will get out of hand, and the globalists, some of them believe it will destroy them.
[02:32:51.787 --> 02:32:55.951]  So they say we want to take over, have world government to shut all this technology down.
[02:32:55.971 --> 02:32:59.614]  Kind of like saying we need world government to stop nuclear war.
[02:33:00.214 --> 02:33:02.216]  But then that's not the dominant group anymore.
[02:33:02.256 --> 02:33:03.117]  Maybe it never was.
[02:33:03.137 --> 02:33:04.899]  Then there's the other group saying, forget that.
[02:33:04.939 --> 02:33:06.721]  We're going to become gods, merge the machines.
[02:33:07.061 --> 02:33:08.122]  The future's not human.
[02:33:08.562 --> 02:33:12.026]  And they've just decided to have an arms race with all these AIs.
[02:33:12.066 --> 02:33:19.113]  We're already in the AI war with a group of humans that believe they're taking control of their own evolution and are about to transcend.
[02:33:19.493 --> 02:33:21.535]  And they're not about to let all these vermin
[02:33:23.207 --> 02:33:27.248]  I concur.
[02:33:27.328 --> 02:33:33.591]  We're kind of splitting humanity into pro-humanity and anti-humanity camps.
[02:33:33.991 --> 02:33:36.892]  People that don't believe in humankind.
[02:33:37.772 --> 02:33:46.955]  And those that don't believe in humankind that have bought into the thesis that we've mismanaged the globe and it's appropriate that our time should be over.
[02:33:48.240 --> 02:34:07.577]  Is is a large fraction, if not the dominant fraction of the community that we collectively call Silicon Valley and the leadership of the World Economic Forum, which is largely structured around the likes of Black Rock State Street, Vanguard, Fink.
[02:34:08.277 --> 02:34:26.259]  At all that perceive all of us in a very Machiavellian frame of reference that's driven by profit and power and control and they really discount what makes us human.
[02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:35.565]  And the value of humankind, and I think this is what it comes down to is, are you pro-human or are you anti-human?
[02:34:35.725 --> 02:34:40.248]  And if you're anti-human, as far as I'm concerned, you don't have a role in the dialogue.
[02:34:41.584 --> 02:34:59.271]  And we have to come together, those of us that are pro-Hume, set aside our differences, recognize what's going on here, and fight like hell, because what's coming at us is very well capitalized and extremely threatening.
[02:35:00.172 --> 02:35:07.735]  And as I have been talking to folks and trying to think about how to reduce this down to some simple concepts,
[02:35:08.735 --> 02:35:31.037]  When you really think about this business model of surveillance capitalism coupled with psychological warfare, what you have is the business of capturing souls, stealing souls without your permission, because they're stealing the essence of what makes you.
[02:35:32.159 --> 02:35:33.460]  Through surveillance capitalism.
[02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:37.722]  And they're taking you over very young and putting you into like a false metaverse.
[02:35:37.762 --> 02:35:41.704]  All the training and education quote-unquote etc.
[02:35:41.784 --> 02:35:41.984]  etc.
[02:35:42.424 --> 02:35:48.387]  They're stealing souls and they're reselling them and then they're manipulating them, okay?
[02:35:48.848 --> 02:35:54.971]  And I never thought three years ago that I would be using terms like evil.
[02:35:55.902 --> 02:36:05.187]  But there doesn't seem to be language other than the language of faith to describe what's happening in humanity right now.
[02:36:05.207 --> 02:36:10.090]  And here's, I want to try to have a little bit of a bright side on this.
[02:36:11.255 --> 02:36:24.481]  If you admit to the existence of evil, which I think many of us increasingly are using that language and framing our understanding of what's going on in the world in those terms, remember that the counterpoint to evil is love and good.
[02:36:30.224 --> 02:36:35.086]  And we as communities need to remember that.
[02:36:35.106 --> 02:36:49.775]  We need to remember that we should come together, those of us that are pro-human, and celebrate our humanity and the things that give us joy and pleasure, and not in a perverse way.
[02:36:50.076 --> 02:36:56.820]  And a lot of those have to do with these classical principles of ethics,
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:08.549]  How to exist in the world with other humans and the importance of loving each other and celebrating our community.
[02:37:09.330 --> 02:37:15.215]  And yeah, so we can come up with a lot of biblical quotes to make that point.
[02:37:16.275 --> 02:37:37.204]  I love the one what shall it profit a man to gain the world and lose his soul and that's what's happening right now is there is an active theft and manipulation of souls and if you use that language and just just for the sake of argument go with me as a metaphor what is the
[02:37:38.542 --> 02:37:48.826]  Metaphor that exists in communities of faith to describe this, to describe this kinds of processes that sweep over humanity from time to time.
[02:37:48.966 --> 02:37:51.267]  We call this demonic or the devil.
[02:37:52.903 --> 02:38:03.013]  And I don't want to get too literal, that's going to put off some people, but I think it's really helpful to think about that as a metaphor.
[02:38:03.513 --> 02:38:09.018]  Demonic and the devil and your soul and what's being done.
[02:38:09.839 --> 02:38:19.847]  With these modern technologies to manipulate you, weaponize the information about you and use it for market purposes.
[02:38:20.047 --> 02:38:37.981]  Revelation, just to interrupt, says that in the end times the beast system, a worldwide government that makes you submit and worship it to be able to buy and sell the global social credit score, that it will then finally traffic in the souls of men and women literally owning us and studying the globalists.
[02:38:38.001 --> 02:38:38.901]  I want you to speak to this.
[02:38:39.682 --> 02:38:40.002]  We're good.
[02:38:58.737 --> 02:38:59.097]  I don't know.
[02:39:19.632 --> 02:39:26.574]  You can say it's a part of the brain if you don't believe in God, and we're all electrochemically connected, and there's some weird survival instinct that makes certain people do this.
[02:39:26.594 --> 02:39:33.975]  Something fundamental in humankind, whatever it is, it has persisted over millennia.
[02:39:34.656 --> 02:39:45.338]  If you want to take a literalist view of the Bible, you could say it represents the accumulated human wisdom of multiple civilizations over millennia.
[02:39:46.298 --> 02:40:03.929]  But this phenomena that we're now living through has happened again and again and again, and within that volume, whether you consider it to be divine revelation or accumulated wisdom of millennia,
[02:40:04.489 --> 02:40:11.011]  Within it is guidance for how to overcome this beast, this force, this darkness.
[02:40:12.171 --> 02:40:24.834]  And all of that comes back around to issues of community, fellowship, respect, and of course these core pillars of
[02:40:26.054 --> 02:40:42.668]  Family and respect, humility, these core philosophical positions that have proven to be successful in enabling successful civilizations.
[02:40:43.448 --> 02:40:59.379]  And I think that there is probably wisdom within that discipline that we often discount because it's not trendy right now to talk about religion and theology.
[02:40:59.419 --> 02:41:00.199]  But it's coming back.
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:05.803]  There are no atheists in foxholes, and we know organized religion's got big problems, and I'm not selling that.
[02:41:06.284 --> 02:41:11.527]  But you're right, these are fundamental things we do, and I personally call it space aliens, whatever you want.
[02:41:11.547 --> 02:41:21.114]  The Bible's pretty clear, like there's the big God that made it all, there's these bad guys that are here, they're right past visual light, they're manipulating our brains, they're trying to get us to basically build things for them, and they get rid of us.
[02:41:21.134 --> 02:41:29.640]  I have kind of a science fiction-esque view of it, and I go back to what they were talking about in the other Sumerian text, and the Indian text, I mean, it's the same story,
[02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:33.163]  Alex, I love your point that if we don't resist, we basically validate their thesis.
[02:41:53.900 --> 02:41:59.643]  We empower them if we don't wake up and do something about it.
[02:42:00.683 --> 02:42:10.948]  I was talking to a colleague here that's actually flown out from Silicon Valley to talk to me about some new ideas he has about how to push back on this and and he makes the point that.
[02:42:12.842 --> 02:42:17.064]  If we don't resist, they'll continue to push until we do so.
[02:42:17.325 --> 02:42:18.505]  We must resist.
[02:42:18.605 --> 02:42:24.168]  We must demonstrate to them that we will not concede to their manipulations.
[02:42:24.669 --> 02:42:25.869]  We won't allow this.
[02:42:25.989 --> 02:42:26.930]  We won't permit it.
[02:42:27.790 --> 02:42:41.358]  And that is going to require a level of rising up, whatever you want to call it, protest, resistance, a lot of different words, but it's kind of
[02:42:42.273 --> 02:42:43.834]  If it's not now, when?
[02:42:44.654 --> 02:42:56.498]  Because that singularity of the threshold with artificial intelligence and general intelligence is coming at us at something like a one to two year horizon.
[02:42:56.538 --> 02:42:58.239]  And once we cross that horizon, that.
[02:42:59.779 --> 02:43:03.701]  That may be the end of the line for humanity as we know it.
[02:43:03.941 --> 02:43:07.443]  And Dr. Malone, you're saying such profound things that I 100% resonate with.
[02:43:07.803 --> 02:43:10.545]  We're simpatico because we're researching and just studying.
[02:43:11.585 --> 02:43:17.969]  And I know you've got to go, and I've got Gerald Celente coming up, but if we can do five more minutes to the next hour, I have a few questions from callers earlier.
[02:43:18.989 --> 02:43:22.451]  They want to know about, ask Dr. Malone about ways to detox from the shots.
[02:43:22.991 --> 02:43:25.913]  There's a lot of thought and research going into that, but I want you to just briefly go back.
[02:43:26.793 --> 02:43:30.335]  This is what I've been told by high-level folks, and I'll just leave it at that, and it's actually come out in the news.
[02:43:30.976 --> 02:43:34.738]  A lot of ultra-rich people, people in the system, billionaires are having heart attacks.
[02:43:34.798 --> 02:43:36.259]  Elon Musk's brother got really sick.
[02:43:36.859 --> 02:43:39.841]  That kind of woke him up, along with him grabbing his son and sterilizing him.
[02:43:40.962 --> 02:43:45.965]  Can you briefly speak to what you're hearing from people that thought they were protected, are now finding out?
[02:43:46.045 --> 02:43:47.686]  This is a death call.
[02:43:47.726 --> 02:43:49.387]  This is going after almost everybody.
[02:43:51.974 --> 02:43:54.076]  So we're going to do that after the break.
[02:43:54.136 --> 02:43:58.221]  We've still got a few minutes, so let's hit the Gates thing and then the vaccine detox thing after.
[02:43:59.482 --> 02:44:09.974]  Yes, so as you say, this is not selective and a case can be made that Mr. Biden may even be a victim of this with his rapid cognitive decline.
[02:44:11.314 --> 02:44:31.024]  We have a variety of symptoms, including central nervous system problems, cardiac problems, blood coagulation problems, and anytime you have this kind of a distributed, decentralized response to, in this case, largely spike protein with an overlay of
[02:44:32.265 --> 02:44:36.230]  The toxicity associated with these lipid nanoparticles and their biodistribution.
[02:44:36.631 --> 02:44:40.195]  And by the way, reproductive toxicology is quite clear also.
[02:44:40.295 --> 02:44:41.557]  We didn't even touch on that.
[02:44:42.297 --> 02:44:48.064]  And you may recall the disclosures regarding the
[02:44:49.566 --> 02:45:07.125]  Pfizer belief system around the origins of the reproductive harms in which it was mentioned by a, I think it was a global director of vaccine development or mRNA vaccine development from Pfizer.
[02:45:08.441 --> 02:45:20.984]  That it was the belief of Pfizer that the damage that was being done was to the pituitary hypothalamic adrenal axis, which is to say your endocrine system.
[02:45:21.524 --> 02:45:24.365]  So don't forget that there's endocrine damage going on.
[02:45:25.045 --> 02:45:28.486]  And this is really cascading.
[02:45:28.766 --> 02:45:32.027]  And of course, then there is the delayed effects associated
[02:45:32.719 --> 02:45:52.685]  with cancer and what is being termed turbo cancer that was early documented by my friend Ryan Cole who's been just wickedly attacked for doing so but it's it's increasingly normalized that we are seeing a a profile of
[02:45:55.046 --> 02:46:04.112]  Extremely aggressive and often recurring cancers that weren't seen before the deployment of the jab.
[02:46:04.792 --> 02:46:11.877]  And then, of course, there's unequivocally these data having to do with excess all-cause mortality.
[02:46:12.417 --> 02:46:19.022]  The only data signal that has any integrity right now is how frequently people die.
[02:46:19.762 --> 02:46:28.532]  And because that can't generally be manipulated by the government or by the CDC or by physicians or other health care providers.
[02:46:28.592 --> 02:46:35.639]  So when you look at those data, it's clear that you don't have a big surge in excess deaths or excess all cause mortality.
[02:46:36.760 --> 02:46:45.344]  With the onset of the viral infections, even though the early infections with Wuhan-1 were the most severe, you're seeing it after the deployment of the jab.
[02:46:46.064 --> 02:47:00.971]  And this is, as you say, starting to cascade into all socioeconomic groups that have gone ahead and accepted the product, except for those that were given special versions of the products or were allowed to not take the product, such as members of Congress.
[02:47:01.411 --> 02:47:07.595]  And by the way, that's come out that in Australia and a bunch of other places, the Pfizer and other employees, they got a special shot.
[02:47:10.366 --> 02:47:12.048]  Yeah, that's not a conspiracy.
[02:47:12.088 --> 02:47:13.069]  That's not a lie.
[02:47:13.829 --> 02:47:19.174]  And it clearly demonstrates how deeply manipulative all this has been.
[02:47:19.574 --> 02:47:20.595]  The show's just premeditated.
[02:47:20.615 --> 02:47:22.196]  We've got to go to break, sir.
[02:47:22.236 --> 02:47:24.258]  Dr. Robert Malone, I could talk to you for five hours.
[02:47:24.318 --> 02:47:25.119]  I know you're very busy.
[02:47:25.359 --> 02:47:26.920]  We should do a commercial free show.
[02:47:27.721 --> 02:47:30.423]  Anytime you want to tape it, then I'll air it on the show, but put it on hold.
[02:47:31.044 --> 02:47:33.586]  Or I'd love to have you just come do a presentation.
[02:47:34.146 --> 02:47:35.007]  Best info out there.
[02:47:35.407 --> 02:47:36.028]  Back in two minutes.
[02:47:37.116 --> 02:47:41.120]  You've seen what President Trump has gone through in the last eight years.
[02:47:41.760 --> 02:47:43.902]  And you've seen a lot of the things that Infowars has gone through.
[02:47:43.922 --> 02:47:50.569]  And I want to thank all of you over the years for your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support, because without you, we would not be on the air.
[02:47:51.129 --> 02:47:55.753]  Now, without getting into a two-hour long story, in the process of the bankruptcy in the last two years,
[02:47:56.454 --> 02:48:08.000]  We were basically sabotaged, and the people that were brought in here to supposedly run things didn't reorder product, even though there was plenty of money at the time, to basically put this operation in a position of shutting down.
[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:17.385]  But by the grace of God, years ago, I set up backup supplement line from one of the main providers of the raw materials we were using.
[02:48:17.825 --> 02:48:24.909]  And so many of these InfoWars MD products are actually our famous products, simply private labeled, and others are
[02:48:25.049 --> 02:48:25.469]  We're good.
[02:48:38.707 --> 02:48:40.429]  Our supplements are basically all sold out.
[02:48:40.809 --> 02:48:44.432]  Only a few things are left, like X2, X3, and some of the other amazing products.
[02:48:44.852 --> 02:48:47.415]  But with InfoWars MD, you have Turmeric 95.
[02:48:47.915 --> 02:48:50.797]  That is the same formula as Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:48:51.178 --> 02:48:53.059]  You have the Nitric Boost.
[02:48:53.099 --> 02:48:54.821]  It's so good for your heart and cardiovascular system.
[02:48:55.161 --> 02:48:57.283]  It is the exact same formula.
[02:48:57.563 --> 02:48:59.085]  So, our Nitric Boost is sold out.
[02:48:59.365 --> 02:49:00.586]  They have their Nitric Boost.
[02:49:00.866 --> 02:49:04.290]  They even let us use their name, Nitric Boost, a few years ago.
[02:49:04.330 --> 02:49:09.315]  So, they're the original makers of this that Dr. Mikovits and others have talked about being one of the best formulas out there.
[02:49:09.755 --> 02:49:12.098]  So, these are all really amazing products.
[02:49:12.118 --> 02:49:18.204]  You want to check out the line of InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com and it funds our operation.
[02:49:18.804 --> 02:49:20.766]  Get great products and help keep us on the air.
[02:49:20.866 --> 02:49:22.068]  I need you to take action.

[02:50:13.939 --> 02:50:17.363]  If you're not getting any collagen in your system, this is a great way to do so.

[02:50:19.805 --> 02:50:21.086]  Superfood greens.

[02:50:22.047 --> 02:50:23.448]  Are you getting the greens in your life?
[02:50:23.968 --> 02:50:26.590]  If you're not eating your vegetables, this is a great way to supplement that.
[02:50:26.690 --> 02:50:27.691]  Superfood greens.
[02:50:28.131 --> 02:50:29.052]  Mushroom Macs.
[02:50:29.172 --> 02:50:31.614]  All the great benefits of mushrooms.
[02:50:31.634 --> 02:50:32.635]  You might not like eating them.
[02:50:32.675 --> 02:50:35.797]  I'm not a big fan of them myself, but you can get it in a capsule.
[02:50:35.817 --> 02:50:37.859]  You don't have to worry about the nasty taste or texture.
[02:50:38.419 --> 02:50:44.200]  And get all the benefits, Mushroom Maxx, Better Mood Plus, Libido RX, Turmeric 95.
[02:50:44.401 --> 02:50:46.581]  Man, the benefits of turmeric are just incredible.
[02:50:46.941 --> 02:50:51.282]  When I'm not taking turmeric, I genuinely can notice the difference.
[02:50:51.322 --> 02:50:54.723]  It's one of those types of supplements where you just, you notice when you're not taking it.
[02:50:55.003 --> 02:51:01.985]  And for me, it's kind of the soreness and maybe some inflammation after a workout or if I play basketball for a couple hours the next day.
[02:51:03.065 --> 02:51:04.467]  I noticed the difference.
[02:51:04.827 --> 02:51:05.628]  I noticed the difference.
[02:51:05.668 --> 02:51:06.529]  And it's kind of sad.
[02:51:06.569 --> 02:51:08.491]  It reminds you you're not going to be young forever.
[02:51:08.811 --> 02:51:10.853]  But that's why turmeric is so important.
[02:51:10.893 --> 02:51:12.155]  Turmeric 95, 25% off.
[02:51:12.375 --> 02:51:14.337]  The prebiotic formula.
[02:51:14.437 --> 02:51:15.618]  The prostate support.
[02:51:16.058 --> 02:51:17.159]  Very important for men.
[02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:18.461]  Nerve Renew.
[02:51:18.701 --> 02:51:19.662]  Joint Max Relief.
[02:51:20.403 --> 02:51:21.424]  Both of those things are key.
[02:51:21.464 --> 02:51:22.565]  And then good night's sleep.
[02:51:22.765 --> 02:51:25.486]  You know, if you're having trouble sleeping, a supplement always great for that.
[02:51:25.746 --> 02:51:26.426]  Good night's sleep.
[02:51:26.906 --> 02:51:32.667]  All of these, the InfoWars MD Premium Supplement line, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:51:32.787 --> 02:51:34.068]  We appreciate your support there.
[02:51:34.588 --> 02:51:36.368]  That's what makes everything we do here possible.
[02:51:36.568 --> 02:51:43.790]  All right, we've only got five minutes left, Dr. Robert Malone, and you started getting into it, but just real fast, do we know of any real detox systems?
[02:51:43.830 --> 02:51:46.591]  And I think you said, well, it hits so many things, it's so complex.
[02:51:47.311 --> 02:51:48.611]  I mean, are there any general things?
[02:51:48.631 --> 02:51:51.432]  I know there's a lot of thought going into this with Peter McCullough and others about
[02:51:51.972 --> 02:51:55.238]  What to do anything the globalists do that they usually have some type of treatment.
[02:51:56.199 --> 02:52:00.746]  Is there anything else you can say to that and then anything you want to add in closing?
[02:52:02.469 --> 02:52:11.734]  Well, I don't sell supplements and as a licensed physician, I don't go on the internet and give medical advice to people that would really cross some lines.
[02:52:11.754 --> 02:52:12.274]  I understand.
[02:52:12.414 --> 02:52:20.058]  And in a very practical way, it would also set me up to be shot by the likes of those that would like to take a crack at me.
[02:52:21.018 --> 02:52:30.102]  But I can say this, in my personal case, I not only had long COVID from my initial infection in February 2020 in Boston,
[02:52:31.932 --> 02:52:44.424]  But then stupidly, ignorantly, trustingly, I took two doses of the jab and got doses from lots that were known to be bad from Moderna when it was first being rolled out.
[02:52:45.186 --> 02:52:50.228]  And I had a series of really life-threatening complications from doing so.
[02:52:50.929 --> 02:53:03.194]  Largely cardiac, I had systolic blood pressure well over 230, POTS syndrome, restless leg, I've had problems with atrial tachycardia, etc.
[02:53:04.418 --> 02:53:07.640]  Um, so what I can tell you is what I did.
[02:53:08.541 --> 02:53:25.954]  And I really give my shout out to Dr. Brooke Miller, a local physician who was, let's say, with us in resisting the imposed protocols and treatment regimens that were so counterproductive and killed many people.
[02:53:27.176 --> 02:53:32.619]  And he took me in hand, and among other things, he said, Robert, you absolutely have to change your diet.
[02:53:33.279 --> 02:53:37.401]  You are pre-diabetic and have elevated inflammatory markers.
[02:53:37.461 --> 02:53:43.544]  And so what I did under Brooke's direction, I completely changed my diet.
[02:53:43.584 --> 02:53:45.545]  I eat a lot of local beef now.
[02:53:46.886 --> 02:53:51.248]  And I cut out sugar, largely.
[02:53:51.268 --> 02:53:52.309]  I'm not perfect.
[02:53:53.169 --> 02:53:55.010]  I do like an M&M from time to time.
[02:53:56.254 --> 02:53:59.277]  And I've dropped about 50 pounds.
[02:54:00.018 --> 02:54:02.039]  That has made a huge impact.
[02:54:02.179 --> 02:54:15.630]  But at the start of this, Brooke also put me on a regimen that included things like ivermectin, steroids, and other medical treatments.
[02:54:15.770 --> 02:54:22.496]  And of course, I'm still on beta blockers at a low dose and some other medical management for my tachycardia.
[02:54:23.470 --> 02:54:38.762]  But for the most part, the weight loss, the cutting out of sugar, reduction in the inflammatory markers that are such clear indicators of susceptibility for long COVID and for COVID symptoms.
[02:54:40.303 --> 02:54:41.865]  I have never taken another jab.
[02:54:41.945 --> 02:54:43.246]  That's important.
[02:54:43.366 --> 02:54:47.189]  If you've taken two, don't take three, let alone six like Tony Fauci.
[02:54:48.438 --> 02:54:54.002]  And live healthy, get good exercise, plenty of sun.
[02:54:54.022 --> 02:55:09.152]  I monitor my vitamin D and zinc levels very closely, and I'm sure, Alex, you are highly attuned to that as your audience is, that the importance of vitamin D and adequate levels together with zinc.
[02:55:09.713 --> 02:55:11.774]  We can go into the molecular biology.
[02:55:12.174 --> 02:55:17.598]  D plus zinc is actually a key signaling molecule for a lot of cellular functions.
[02:55:18.819 --> 02:55:29.468]  So, there's a variety of things, and we also take curcumin and many other supplements that have been proven to have beneficial effects.
[02:55:29.528 --> 02:55:35.414]  So, in short, get yourself a doc that understands how to treat lung COVID.
[02:55:36.241 --> 02:55:43.368]  Or covid disease that isn't caught up in the narrative that's willing to use some of these alternative means.
[02:55:43.968 --> 02:55:53.537]  And remember that for some that have some of the metabolic or endocrine systems, if their endocrine system has been damaged, it needs to go through a global reset.
[02:55:54.357 --> 02:55:58.820]  And a very careful monitoring by someone who's a specialist in this.
[02:56:23.817 --> 02:56:26.318]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:56:26.758 --> 02:56:27.458]  Great job, Doc.
[02:56:27.838 --> 02:56:29.179]  Gerald Cilente's coming up.
[02:56:29.879 --> 02:56:31.860]  All right, Gerald Cilente is about to take over.
[02:56:31.900 --> 02:56:33.680]  He always knocks us out of the park to no extra order.
[02:56:33.700 --> 02:56:36.521]  We'll devastate the Globalist coming up in 55 minutes.
[02:56:37.322 --> 02:56:38.862]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:56:38.882 --> 02:56:42.543]  We'll also send the feed out at Real Alex Jones on X and radio and TV stations across the country.
[02:56:42.583 --> 02:56:48.125]  Also pick up his show and the other broadcasts we have like the morning show with the great Harrison Smith, 8 a.m.
[02:56:48.205 --> 02:56:49.706]  Central American Journal.
[02:56:51.323 --> 02:56:53.624]  But that Dr. Robert Malone interview was so important.
[02:56:53.664 --> 02:56:55.104]  He's a top scientist.
[02:56:56.125 --> 02:57:00.506]  Didn't even really believe in, you know, this good and evil stuff being an actual manifestation until he's seen it.
[02:57:01.206 --> 02:57:04.728]  And the globalists are going out of their way to carry this out, okay?
[02:57:05.448 --> 02:57:06.868]  And I've studied the globalists.
[02:57:06.908 --> 02:57:07.829]  They believe in the devil.
[02:57:08.329 --> 02:57:10.890]  They believe they're getting advanced, you know, technology.
[02:57:11.450 --> 02:57:12.790]  You can call it whatever you want.
[02:57:13.090 --> 02:57:14.511]  Evil does exist.
[02:57:15.331 --> 02:57:17.452]  And it is working through humans to do this.
[02:57:18.153 --> 02:57:20.054]  Now, Gerald's taking over here in just a moment.
[02:57:20.754 --> 02:57:22.955]  Please remember, we can't do this without you.
[02:57:22.995 --> 02:57:24.376]  Plus, we have great products you need.
[02:57:24.877 --> 02:57:26.577]  You talk about curcumin, curcuminoid.
[02:57:27.378 --> 02:57:30.019]  That's what's in the body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:57:30.440 --> 02:57:31.380]  That's what's in Turmeric 95.
[02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:38.364]  They're two different formulas, the same 95% curcuminoid, but sometimes one is sold out and the other is not sold out, so they're both great.
[02:57:38.864 --> 02:57:40.505]  That's at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:58:50.603 --> 02:58:51.043]  Yeah!

[02:58:55.844 --> 02:58:58.525]  But whatever you do, please pray for the broadcast and pray for peace.
[02:58:59.205 --> 02:59:03.546]  And please pray for a safe and fair and as open an election as we can get.
[02:59:04.386 --> 02:59:08.947]  And please share the articles, the videos, and the reports, because we have millions of viewers and listeners.
[02:59:09.347 --> 02:59:14.309]  But when you decide to share the feeds and the articles and things, when you decide to take action, it changes the world.
[02:59:14.329 --> 02:59:16.889]  We've seen so many great listeners.
[02:59:16.909 --> 02:59:18.110]  I don't call you fans.
[02:59:18.430 --> 02:59:21.570]  You're just supporters, and I'm your supporter, and you're my supporter.
[02:59:21.590 --> 02:59:22.251]  We're a family.
[02:59:22.491 --> 02:59:24.451]  Black, white, old, young, you name it.
[02:59:25.191 --> 02:59:30.633]  And we are in this fight together, and I just see so many great clips you take out of the show and post on X.
[02:59:31.533 --> 02:59:33.274]  You know, hundreds of thousands and millions of views.
[02:59:33.395 --> 02:59:34.075]  It's beautiful.
[02:59:34.575 --> 02:59:35.456]  It's amazing.
[02:59:35.516 --> 02:59:36.737]  And so I want to thank you all.
[02:59:36.777 --> 02:59:37.538]  You know who you are.
[02:59:37.858 --> 02:59:38.699]  And I want to salute you.
[02:59:38.719 --> 02:59:43.643]  Talk about an old friend and a top trends forecaster who's been calling it like it is.
[02:59:44.183 --> 02:59:46.665]  Gerald Cilente takes over now for the next 50 minutes.
[02:59:47.966 --> 02:59:48.687]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:59:48.727 --> 02:59:49.948]  And thank you for all that you do.
[02:59:50.508 --> 02:59:54.111]  And everyone listening to what Alex saying and the products that they have.
[02:59:54.612 --> 02:59:59.976]  And I was just listening to part of what Dr. Malone was saying about how he lost weight, got into shape.
[03:00:00.757 --> 03:00:00.957]  You know,
[03:00:01.701 --> 03:00:03.042]  Again, this is the data.
[03:00:04.202 --> 03:00:12.806]  The CDC said that 61% of the 1 to 17 year olds that were hospitalized for COVID were obese.
[03:00:14.126 --> 03:00:22.190]  It was never a word from the prostitutes, the little media whores, the little lemon boys, or lemon girls, I'm not sure.
[03:00:23.310 --> 03:00:24.591]  Yeah, even them.
[03:00:25.271 --> 03:00:27.092]  Not a word about getting healthy.
[03:00:27.652 --> 03:00:30.193]  Not a word about building up your immune system.
[03:00:30.916 --> 03:00:31.937]  Not a word.
[03:00:32.237 --> 03:00:33.378]  You better get that job.
[03:00:33.778 --> 03:00:34.739]  Better get that job.
[03:00:35.039 --> 03:00:35.960]  You don't get that job.
[03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:37.782]  You got no job.
[03:00:39.103 --> 03:00:41.064]  Oh, said the slob.
[03:00:42.105 --> 03:00:43.026]  Which slob?
[03:00:44.107 --> 03:00:44.927]  Every one of them.
[03:00:45.648 --> 03:00:46.529]  Every one of them.
[03:00:47.109 --> 03:00:49.271]  Oh, how about all those little comedians?
[03:00:49.831 --> 03:00:50.212]  Oh, yeah.
[03:00:50.432 --> 03:00:51.773]  Oh, listen to Jimmy Kimmel.
[03:00:51.953 --> 03:00:52.133]  Yeah.
[03:00:52.333 --> 03:00:54.055]  Why don't you swallow crap?
[03:00:54.614 --> 03:00:56.015]  I do swallow crap.
[03:00:56.395 --> 03:01:03.920]  I'm an average American, obese, out of my mind, dumber than crap, and all I do is swallow crap.
[03:01:04.241 --> 03:01:16.229]  Whether it's the crap from the junk food and ultra-processed food, or the crap that the prostitutes sell, that you don't get anywhere else than on InfoWars.
[03:01:16.829 --> 03:01:19.191]  You get the products and the information that you need.
[03:01:20.163 --> 03:01:23.164]  So support InfoWars because they're supporting you.
[03:01:23.184 --> 03:01:26.505]  And these products, again, this isn't BS.
[03:01:26.525 --> 03:01:33.828]  This is the first book I worked on back in the 1980s when barely anyone was ever talking about this natural healing.
[03:01:34.809 --> 03:01:38.830]  I take about 22 vitamins and supplements every day.
[03:01:38.850 --> 03:01:46.173]  I got one cold in five and a half years that lasted for like two weeks.
[03:01:48.192 --> 03:01:50.193]  Never talked about getting in good shape.
[03:01:50.314 --> 03:01:52.455]  Oh, and again, the data, the data.
[03:01:53.616 --> 03:01:54.556]  What was it, about 2.6%?
[03:01:55.297 --> 03:02:07.945]  Excuse me, the people that died of COVID had 2.6 pre-existing comorbidities.
[03:02:11.188 --> 03:02:11.768]  So that's it.
[03:02:11.928 --> 03:02:16.051]  You gotta, you know, this is, it's a lot of, and don't forget,
[03:02:16.926 --> 03:02:20.149]  Before you masturbate, sanitize your hands.
[03:02:20.869 --> 03:02:22.010]  Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[03:02:22.571 --> 03:02:26.334]  And don't forget, don't forget, wear the mask.
[03:02:26.994 --> 03:02:27.715]  Wear the mask.
[03:02:28.395 --> 03:02:38.764]  The mask that says... These masks do not eliminate exposure to the risk of any disease or infection.
[03:02:39.204 --> 03:02:42.607]  But I'm your little slimeball politician!
[03:02:43.047 --> 03:02:45.449]  I'll tell you what to do, you piece of crap!
[03:02:46.369 --> 03:02:47.771]  I'm in charge!
[03:02:50.293 --> 03:02:51.494]  We own you!
[03:02:55.838 --> 03:02:57.980]  And people swallow the crap.
[03:02:58.741 --> 03:03:02.284]  I'm one of the most hated people in uptown Kingston, in Kingston.
[03:03:02.805 --> 03:03:03.025]  Yeah.
[03:03:03.505 --> 03:03:05.087]  Because I had a rally.
[03:03:05.647 --> 03:03:07.269]  I had a freedom rally.
[03:03:08.174 --> 03:03:10.194]  When everything was locked down.
[03:03:10.795 --> 03:03:12.895]  Oh, about five, six hundred people were here.
[03:03:13.175 --> 03:03:14.896]  We all died of COVID.
[03:03:15.276 --> 03:03:16.136]  Everybody.
[03:03:19.337 --> 03:03:19.717]  And again.
[03:03:22.417 --> 03:03:23.558]  Look at the facts.
[03:03:24.838 --> 03:03:25.578]  Get healthy.
[03:03:25.938 --> 03:03:29.279]  Get in the best shape you can physically, emotionally and spiritually.
[03:03:29.579 --> 03:03:30.859]  You're in the fight for your life.
[03:03:31.500 --> 03:03:32.760]  You're in the fight for your life.
[03:03:34.200 --> 03:03:37.161]  And you got to get the products at Infowars because they're helping you.
[03:03:37.898 --> 03:03:38.619]  Win that fight.
[03:03:39.960 --> 03:03:45.705]  You know, going on here, this is coming out in the Trends Journal, and that's going out tomorrow.
[03:03:46.246 --> 03:03:47.527]  And talking about health, ready?
[03:03:49.008 --> 03:03:49.329]  U.S.
[03:03:49.409 --> 03:03:54.874]  ranks last in life expectancy among English-speaking, top English-speaking countries.
[03:03:56.015 --> 03:03:56.155]  Yep.
[03:03:56.175 --> 03:04:01.600]  76.5 years for men, 81.5 years for women.
[03:04:05.785 --> 03:04:09.246]  So I guess I'm living a half a year longer than I should have.
[03:04:12.286 --> 03:04:13.826]  Because I'm, I'm 77.
[03:04:14.847 --> 03:04:15.527]  Wonder why?
[03:04:16.947 --> 03:04:17.787]  Can't figure it out.
[03:04:19.487 --> 03:04:27.569]  Oh, poor diet blamed for jumping colorectal cancers among young people.
[03:04:27.589 --> 03:04:33.310]  A new study released by Cleveland Clinic, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:04:33.350 --> 03:04:34.290]  Dramatic rise.
[03:04:35.110 --> 03:04:35.230]  Yeah.
[03:04:39.648 --> 03:04:42.729]  It's because of all of the crap that people eat.
[03:04:43.989 --> 03:04:45.510]  It's a crap show.
[03:04:46.810 --> 03:04:51.152]  You got crap spewing out of the mouths of these little nothing little boys.
[03:04:51.892 --> 03:04:55.693]  Why the hell do they keep quoting Lindsey?
[03:04:55.713 --> 03:04:58.234]  Did you come out of the closet yet, Graham?
[03:04:58.654 --> 03:05:00.335]  A little slobby jerk.
[03:05:01.545 --> 03:05:06.387]  Every damn day, hearing the crap spewing out of his mouth.
[03:05:06.827 --> 03:05:08.087]  Calm down, Salenti!
[03:05:08.667 --> 03:05:10.408]  Be a crap swallower!
[03:05:11.248 --> 03:05:12.869]  Oh, you don't like fast food?
[03:05:13.549 --> 03:05:15.470]  You don't like ultra-processed food?
[03:05:17.991 --> 03:05:30.895]  We swallow crap, whether it comes out of the mouths of politicians or the crap that we throw down our throat that morons and imbeciles call, quote, food.
[03:05:31.872 --> 03:05:34.434]  And I get, oh, you'll hate me for this.
[03:05:35.234 --> 03:05:36.495]  You'll hate me for this.
[03:05:37.355 --> 03:05:51.803]  America blimped out, slobbed out when the mothers stopped raising their kids and put them in nursing homes for children that they called daycare centers.
[03:05:53.664 --> 03:05:55.425]  You're out of your mind as a kid.
[03:05:56.126 --> 03:05:56.726]  Oh, you don't want
[03:05:58.055 --> 03:05:59.116]  Your mama to raise you?
[03:05:59.316 --> 03:06:02.579]  No, no, we got somebody that we pay nothing.
[03:06:03.180 --> 03:06:06.182]  And we feed them all crap as everybody's out of their mind.
[03:06:08.304 --> 03:06:09.545]  My mother makes you rest in peace.
[03:06:09.565 --> 03:06:10.266]  There was seven of us.
[03:06:10.286 --> 03:06:11.427]  She's cooking all the time.
[03:06:12.168 --> 03:06:17.112]  And everybody loved to come to Aunt Marie's because she was the best.
[03:06:17.713 --> 03:06:19.935]  And my father taught her how to cook.
[03:06:20.495 --> 03:06:21.897]  Yeah, he rest in peace.
[03:06:22.797 --> 03:06:23.218]  But now
[03:06:24.542 --> 03:06:25.823]  Just keep eating that crap.
[03:06:26.303 --> 03:06:27.284]  Swallow that crap.
[03:06:27.524 --> 03:06:28.645]  But take those jams.
[03:06:28.965 --> 03:06:30.066]  Take those jams.
[03:06:30.286 --> 03:06:32.708]  Take all of those prescription drugs.
[03:06:33.709 --> 03:06:38.393]  There's no prescription drug that cures a chronic degenerative disease.
[03:06:38.693 --> 03:06:38.953]  Nothing.
[03:06:40.714 --> 03:06:44.737]  No allotropic drug that cures a chronic degenerative disease.
[03:06:45.178 --> 03:06:52.944]  So you got to take those supplements and vitamins and all those products or a lot of the products that they have on InfoWars.
[03:06:53.908 --> 03:06:54.968]  Going on to the markets.
[03:06:55.068 --> 03:06:56.849]  Hey, what was one of your top trends this year?
[03:06:59.810 --> 03:07:01.151]  Golden year for gold.
[03:07:01.931 --> 03:07:03.011]  Golden year for gold.
[03:07:03.371 --> 03:07:08.373]  Gold is up nearly $500 an ounce since we made that forecast.
[03:07:08.433 --> 03:07:09.774]  And we don't give financial advice.
[03:07:09.794 --> 03:07:10.854]  Don't tell you what to do.
[03:07:11.294 --> 03:07:14.195]  In your trends journal, average is about 100, 200, 190 pages a week.
[03:07:14.275 --> 03:07:14.695]  Not one ad.
[03:07:14.735 --> 03:07:14.915]  Zip.
[03:07:14.935 --> 03:07:15.015]  Nada.
[03:07:15.296 --> 03:07:15.636]  Nothing.
[03:07:25.819 --> 03:07:27.240]  Nobody pays us to say anything.
[03:07:28.061 --> 03:07:34.525]  We don't sell anything other than the magazine for a grand total if you go to jonestrends.com for $2.50 a week.
[03:07:35.126 --> 03:07:40.590]  Or, of course, you could get the... This is the propaganda.
[03:07:40.870 --> 03:07:42.111]  This is the wall crap journal.
[03:07:42.151 --> 03:07:42.932]  They can't say the word.
[03:07:42.972 --> 03:07:45.974]  It begins with an S and an H. You got an I in there and another letter.
[03:07:46.394 --> 03:07:46.875]  Yeah, look at that.
[03:07:47.215 --> 03:07:48.376]  Look at that.
[03:07:48.696 --> 03:07:50.037]  Doesn't look like a bad place, does it?
[03:07:53.411 --> 03:07:54.471]  Search for safety.
[03:07:54.811 --> 03:08:05.094]  Russian civilians evacuate from the cursed region, took refuge Sunday in a boxing gym following the incursion by Ukrainian forces.
[03:08:06.154 --> 03:08:13.115]  The advance by Kiev dealt a blow to Putin's image as a guarantor of stability and security.
[03:08:13.515 --> 03:08:14.996]  How's that for propaganda?
[03:08:15.456 --> 03:08:20.897]  Oh, hey, how come you're not showing the pictures on front pages, which you never do?
[03:08:22.472 --> 03:08:27.036]  Of all the Palestinians that are being slaughtered in front of everybody's eyes.
[03:08:28.897 --> 03:08:30.819]  Oh no, Palestinian lives don't matter.
[03:08:33.301 --> 03:08:36.483]  Wait, wait, the report came out?
[03:08:37.044 --> 03:08:37.844]  17,000 children killed?
[03:08:39.545 --> 03:08:40.346]  By the Israelis?
[03:08:42.588 --> 03:08:44.690]  Over 2,000 toddlers?
[03:08:45.730 --> 03:08:47.512]  Well, but we won't talk about that.
[03:08:48.032 --> 03:08:48.833]  Not a word about it.
[03:08:49.273 --> 03:08:50.274]  Anywhere, anyplace.
[03:08:50.974 --> 03:08:51.555]  Nope, nope.
[03:08:52.298 --> 03:08:57.062]  A once cautious Harris is now the Democrats' driving force.
[03:09:00.084 --> 03:09:01.866]  That's how stupid it is.
[03:09:04.508 --> 03:09:14.236]  Camilla Hilarious, as my good friend Mark Ferraro, hairstylist of the stars, calls her.
[03:09:15.157 --> 03:09:19.320]  Camilla Hilarious is the driving
[03:09:19.881 --> 03:09:24.342]  The Democrats driving force, it could drive you crazy.
[03:09:25.343 --> 03:09:28.164]  Again, you know me, I don't like any of the gang, man.
[03:09:28.804 --> 03:09:30.224]  It's a joke.
[03:09:30.544 --> 03:09:33.405]  I own the trademark presidential reality show.
[03:09:34.106 --> 03:09:35.426]  That's all it is to me.
[03:09:36.186 --> 03:09:41.568]  But again, nothing about the slaughter going on.
[03:09:42.208 --> 03:09:42.408]  Nope.
[03:09:44.589 --> 03:09:44.769]  Nope.
[03:09:45.768 --> 03:09:46.729]  Not a word.
[03:09:47.109 --> 03:09:50.051]  Let's take a look at the Turlett paper record.
[03:09:50.431 --> 03:09:52.772]  This is trend forecasting I'm giving you, by the way.
[03:09:53.233 --> 03:09:54.694]  And again, I have best-selling books.
[03:09:55.754 --> 03:09:56.015]  Trends 2000.
[03:09:56.235 --> 03:10:03.639]  They don't teach trend forecasting at Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Cambridge, Oxford.
[03:10:03.659 --> 03:10:04.460]  They don't know how.
[03:10:05.100 --> 03:10:05.861]  Trend tracking.
[03:10:06.521 --> 03:10:11.004]  So I'm doing this to show you what to do as a trend forecaster.
[03:10:11.044 --> 03:10:12.245]  We subscribe to this.
[03:10:13.092 --> 03:10:14.313]  Hardly get any articles.
[03:10:14.513 --> 03:10:16.533]  Every now and then you get a couple articles that are worthy.
[03:10:17.374 --> 03:10:21.796]  But we want to see what everybody's saying, and how they're saying it, so we get the big picture.
[03:10:22.736 --> 03:10:28.538]  Again, the Israel war going on, we subscribe, we pay to go to Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper.
[03:10:29.459 --> 03:10:31.780]  Every day we go to Times of Israel, Jerusalem Post.
[03:10:31.960 --> 03:10:36.662]  We go to ISNA, IRNA, the Iranian, Tehran Times.
[03:10:37.262 --> 03:10:40.443]  Al Jazeera, here with the Arabs, I have to say.
[03:10:41.063 --> 03:10:42.604]  Persians, of course, the Iranians.
[03:10:43.211 --> 03:10:43.992]  And then you go here.
[03:10:44.572 --> 03:10:49.876]  This this is the stupidity of the crap that they throw down your throat.
[03:10:50.217 --> 03:10:59.064]  And again, this is why the elections are we're saying this, because you only have single issues that a majority of the people are going to vote for.
[03:11:02.166 --> 03:11:09.192]  Mourners at Dorian Ron bonus burial this month.
[03:11:10.259 --> 03:11:19.102]  He was killed after leaving home to protest Venezuela's disputed election result.
[03:11:20.643 --> 03:11:26.184]  Now, I'm sure we're all very concerned about what's going on there in Venezuela.
[03:11:27.705 --> 03:11:28.685]  What the hell do I care?
[03:11:28.705 --> 03:11:30.246]  This crap's been going on for how long?
[03:11:31.206 --> 03:11:36.748]  What, with the Spanish ruining the place, robbing it, stealing everything they could for a while?
[03:11:37.637 --> 03:11:39.897]  I mean, this crap's been going, it's none of my business.
[03:11:39.977 --> 03:11:40.718]  I'm an American.
[03:11:41.158 --> 03:11:43.458]  I believe in the Founding Fathers, like George Washington.
[03:11:44.358 --> 03:11:46.439]  Don't become involved in any of these foreign entanglements.
[03:11:47.319 --> 03:11:50.500]  And then you read the book by Smedley Butler, Wars of Racket.
[03:11:51.020 --> 03:11:54.321]  How the United States got involved in all this stuff to help the bigs.
[03:11:54.681 --> 03:11:56.261]  United Fruit, one after another.
[03:11:56.281 --> 03:12:01.942]  As I said, you think we would have invaded Iraq if their major export was broccoli?
[03:12:03.342 --> 03:12:05.103]  Or you forgot, what's his name, Halliburton?
[03:12:06.647 --> 03:12:08.028]  I gotta be proper.
[03:12:08.068 --> 03:12:10.169]  They've told me to watch my language on the show.
[03:12:10.769 --> 03:12:15.251]  So I don't want to call him Dick Cheney.
[03:12:15.811 --> 03:12:16.592]  Penis Cheney.
[03:12:17.052 --> 03:12:18.513]  The guy that was the head of Halliburton.
[03:12:18.893 --> 03:12:20.874]  Oh yeah, they went to Iraq right away?
[03:12:20.914 --> 03:12:21.154]  Yeah.
[03:12:23.835 --> 03:12:25.656]  Again, not a word.
[03:12:26.136 --> 03:12:26.496]  What the hell?
[03:12:26.596 --> 03:12:27.177]  What do I care?
[03:12:27.537 --> 03:12:31.819]  How about the slaughter going on every day?
[03:12:32.711 --> 03:12:36.535]  About the massacre of innocent people in Palestine.
[03:12:37.235 --> 03:12:40.558]  Under the BS lie that we're demolishing the place.
[03:12:41.499 --> 03:12:43.601]  Because Hamas is hiding everywhere!
[03:12:45.623 --> 03:12:50.147]  So this is why, again, you subscribe to the Trends Journal, TrendsJournal.com.
[03:12:50.548 --> 03:12:56.293]  Again, we get no magazine, nobody anywhere call this a golden year for gold.
[03:12:56.353 --> 03:12:57.394]  I want to make that straight.
[03:12:58.368 --> 03:12:59.909]  And then go back to your Trends Journal.
[03:12:59.969 --> 03:13:02.330]  Last year, Middle East meltdown.
[03:13:02.610 --> 03:13:07.313]  We warned this was going to happen under the new Netanyahu regime.
[03:13:09.594 --> 03:13:13.417]  So this is what we're giving you, and this is what they're giving you.
[03:13:13.977 --> 03:13:18.239]  Voters know Harris's name, but little else.
[03:13:19.360 --> 03:13:19.900]  You got it.
[03:13:21.541 --> 03:13:22.041]  You got it.
[03:13:25.824 --> 03:13:26.624]  They know nothing.
[03:13:27.293 --> 03:13:29.394]  It's going to be single issues.
[03:13:29.795 --> 03:13:31.016]  This is what we're saying.
[03:13:31.476 --> 03:13:34.258]  And this is why we're saying that Harris is going to win.
[03:13:34.458 --> 03:13:35.278]  Like it, hate it.
[03:13:35.699 --> 03:13:39.922]  Again, it's not what you want, what you like, what you wish for, what you believe in as a trend forecast.
[03:13:39.962 --> 03:13:40.622]  It's what is.
[03:13:41.142 --> 03:13:43.024]  We only look at the data.
[03:13:44.204 --> 03:13:47.006]  And the data shows what's going to happen here.
[03:13:48.187 --> 03:13:51.109]  As we keep saying over and over and over and over and over and over.
[03:13:51.129 --> 03:13:55.512]  Abortion is going to be a major issue.
[03:13:58.869 --> 03:14:02.932]  And this was a trend alert that we sent to subscribers about a month ago.
[03:14:03.872 --> 03:14:04.673]  Kamala Harris 2024.
[03:14:05.073 --> 03:14:10.076]  The Trends Journal's May 2022 forecast.
[03:14:12.538 --> 03:14:21.284]  On May 17, 2022, our trend forecast is that, quote, Harris has aspirations to be president of the United States.
[03:14:22.485 --> 03:14:26.687]  And she knows that her boss is an unpopular president who is 79 years old.
[03:14:28.769 --> 03:14:36.736]  She wants to be a party standard bearer and needs to start making a name for herself if she hopes to run for president again.
[03:14:38.458 --> 03:14:48.947]  Being that Biden is viewed as ineffective in bringing down inflation and strongly boosting the economy, Harris will seize upon abortion as a key issue.
[03:14:49.788 --> 03:14:50.208]  All right?
[03:14:51.229 --> 03:14:52.330]  And we say here that
[03:14:54.181 --> 03:15:01.603]  This is going on the midterm elections that the Republicans weren't going to do well because of their anti-abortion stance.
[03:15:03.103 --> 03:15:07.424]  So again, it's not what you like, what you wish for, what you want, it's what is.
[03:15:07.804 --> 03:15:09.184]  And that is what happened.
[03:15:10.004 --> 03:15:16.866]  They could have slaughtered the Democrats in the midterm because, quote, it's the economy, stupid.
[03:15:17.246 --> 03:15:19.826]  The people were disgusted with the economy.
[03:15:20.286 --> 03:15:23.467]  But they kept bringing up this anti-abortion stuff.
[03:15:24.679 --> 03:15:26.340]  So you put the numbers together.
[03:15:28.021 --> 03:15:30.142]  She's gonna get the majority of the woman vote.
[03:15:33.264 --> 03:15:45.711]  And according to an NBC poll, now this is going back to 2023, when we wrote this piece.
[03:15:45.731 --> 03:15:47.832]  64% of Americans think abortion should be legal.
[03:15:49.413 --> 03:15:51.274]  So you don't gotta be good at math to figure this out.
[03:15:53.215 --> 03:15:57.856]  87% of the Democrats want it legal.
[03:15:58.296 --> 03:15:58.756]  And you're ready?
[03:16:00.137 --> 03:16:01.897]  65% of independents.
[03:16:04.377 --> 03:16:06.298]  Only 37% are Republicans.
[03:16:07.418 --> 03:16:08.278]  So you do the numbers.
[03:16:08.658 --> 03:16:10.439]  She's gonna get the woman vote, the black vote.
[03:16:12.739 --> 03:16:14.000]  She's gonna get most of the Asian vote.
[03:16:19.821 --> 03:16:20.781]  And that's the way we see it.
[03:16:21.573 --> 03:16:24.734]  Again, like it or not, again, minus a wild card.
[03:16:27.554 --> 03:16:30.355]  Here's another article in the toilet paper record.
[03:16:32.455 --> 03:16:34.476]  World's eyes turned to Chicago.
[03:16:34.516 --> 03:16:36.356]  I lived in Chicago, by the way, for six years.
[03:16:36.396 --> 03:16:37.276]  The people there were great.
[03:16:37.916 --> 03:16:38.597]  It was so nice.
[03:16:38.617 --> 03:16:40.197]  I had a great time.
[03:16:40.277 --> 03:16:43.458]  But there was only two seasons in Chicago, winter and August.
[03:16:45.458 --> 03:16:49.919]  The request for a bid for the Democratic National Convention had been sitting
[03:16:51.343 --> 03:16:56.105]  Unanswered under the office of Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago.
[03:16:56.446 --> 03:16:57.686]  Couldn't have a better name.
[03:16:57.786 --> 03:16:59.007]  Lightfoot Lighthead.
[03:17:01.168 --> 03:17:01.528]  Anyway.
[03:17:02.449 --> 03:17:04.850]  Goes on.
[03:17:05.610 --> 03:17:07.331]  The chief of staff of J.B.
[03:17:07.431 --> 03:17:08.532]  Pritzker of Illinois.
[03:17:08.552 --> 03:17:10.693]  First in the governor's office.
[03:17:11.393 --> 03:17:12.874]  Why wouldn't Chicago do this?
[03:17:13.154 --> 03:17:15.595]  Mr. Pritzker asked according to senior aides.
[03:17:16.076 --> 03:17:17.036]  So this guy Pritzker?
[03:17:18.257 --> 03:17:18.457]  Yeah.
[03:17:20.020 --> 03:17:21.421]  Another little daddy's boy.
[03:17:23.302 --> 03:17:23.642]  Boy.
[03:17:24.783 --> 03:17:25.983]  A big daddy's boy.
[03:17:26.003 --> 03:17:28.925]  Blimpitis.
[03:17:28.945 --> 03:17:33.247]  My daddy's the Hyatt family.
[03:17:34.568 --> 03:17:34.808]  Yeah.
[03:17:36.089 --> 03:17:37.710]  Another daddy's boy.
[03:17:38.710 --> 03:17:41.692]  As George Collins said, it's one big club and you ain't in it.
[03:17:43.255 --> 03:17:44.716]  I'm Gavin Newsome!
[03:17:45.116 --> 03:17:46.256]  Gruesome Newsome!
[03:17:46.577 --> 03:17:48.878]  My daddy worked for the Getty Gang!
[03:17:49.718 --> 03:17:51.359]  I'm Andy Cuomo!
[03:17:51.619 --> 03:17:54.420]  Renaming the Tappan Zee Bridge after my daddy!
[03:17:54.700 --> 03:17:56.861]  I wish the governor liked to fill him up!
[03:17:57.261 --> 03:17:57.501]  Yeah.
[03:17:58.562 --> 03:18:03.524]  Oh, little Georgie Bush was a pair of cojones smaller than a mothball.
[03:18:04.164 --> 03:18:06.065]  My daddy was Georgie.
[03:18:06.526 --> 03:18:09.647]  My granddaddy was Prescott.
[03:18:10.419 --> 03:18:13.662]  Oh, how about Little True Dope over there up in Canada?
[03:18:14.082 --> 03:18:15.423]  I forget who his daddy was.
[03:18:15.483 --> 03:18:16.564]  Maybe it was Castro.
[03:18:16.884 --> 03:18:17.645]  Not sure.
[03:18:17.665 --> 03:18:19.827]  All right?
[03:18:20.687 --> 03:18:21.228]  You got it?
[03:18:21.688 --> 03:18:23.610]  A gang is running the nation.
[03:18:24.410 --> 03:18:26.232]  We've lost our freedom.
[03:18:26.852 --> 03:18:29.094]  It's the U.S.S.A.
[03:18:30.115 --> 03:18:36.140]  United Soviet States of America run by an arrogant, gutless,
[03:18:37.230 --> 03:18:41.211]  Can't use the word, but it begins like a baseball, with a less at the end.
[03:18:41.952 --> 03:18:43.672]  Little pieces of crap.
[03:18:44.573 --> 03:18:47.153]  So, that's why you gotta support InfoWars.
[03:18:47.173 --> 03:18:49.374]  Because they're supporting you.
[03:18:49.874 --> 03:18:50.735]  Get the products.
[03:18:51.955 --> 03:18:56.277]  If you wanna stay healthy, stay strong, stay with it.
[03:18:56.297 --> 03:19:01.538]  If you wanna stay with the InfoWars products, go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:01.638 --> 03:19:02.819]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:03.894 --> 03:19:10.679]  And again, when we come back, we're going to talk about the economy, where it's going, what you might want to do, and what's next.
[03:19:11.259 --> 03:19:12.340]  So stay tuned.
[03:19:12.520 --> 03:19:13.101]  Be right back.
[03:19:13.840 --> 03:19:15.901]  The InfoWars system is very simple.
[03:19:16.121 --> 03:19:20.684]  We tell you the truth about what's going on in the world, and we ask that you support us in exchange.
[03:19:20.804 --> 03:19:23.705]  If we don't tell you the truth, you probably won't support us.
[03:19:24.046 --> 03:19:25.246]  That's our only incentive.
[03:19:25.386 --> 03:19:27.888]  All we have is you, the InfoWars audience.
[03:19:28.448 --> 03:19:36.392]  And just like our information has to be good, or else we can't expect your support, well our products have to be good, or we can't expect you to be returning customers.
[03:19:36.412 --> 03:19:40.275]  And everybody knows some of the bombshell, incredible, iconic
[03:19:41.155 --> 03:19:41.475]  I don't know.
[03:20:02.841 --> 03:20:03.921]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:03.941 --> 03:20:06.963]  You know, I was just thinking, you know, people go, you go to a place, where are the restrooms?
[03:20:24.116 --> 03:20:26.157]  Why do they call them restrooms, Floyd?
[03:20:26.377 --> 03:20:27.558]  You're not resting there.
[03:20:27.578 --> 03:20:29.039]  I wonder how he came up with this name.
[03:20:29.379 --> 03:20:30.480]  Going to the restroom.
[03:20:31.180 --> 03:20:33.021]  Pee or poo, you're calling it a restroom?
[03:20:33.181 --> 03:20:33.581]  Anyway.
[03:20:34.302 --> 03:20:36.023]  In Europe, they call them toilets.
[03:20:36.943 --> 03:20:38.544]  In the Bronx, you'd call them toilets.
[03:20:40.285 --> 03:20:40.685]  Anyway.
[03:20:42.186 --> 03:20:44.387]  People ask, you know, I do a lot of interviews and things.
[03:20:44.407 --> 03:20:49.530]  And at the end, they say, well, what advice can you give people?
[03:20:50.171 --> 03:20:52.232]  He says, you get in the best shape you can.
[03:20:53.311 --> 03:20:55.293]  Physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[03:20:56.533 --> 03:20:58.515]  Again, I don't want to become an inmate in a nursing home.
[03:20:58.895 --> 03:21:01.317]  I took my sister out of one.
[03:21:01.457 --> 03:21:05.000]  Unfortunately, she passed away, but I had her up here in Kingston.
[03:21:05.040 --> 03:21:05.780]  She was doing great.
[03:21:07.321 --> 03:21:10.043]  And I gotta show you something.
[03:21:10.063 --> 03:21:10.704]  It's right over here.
[03:21:10.724 --> 03:21:11.404]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:21:11.424 --> 03:21:13.006]  Tell you about my sister.
[03:21:13.746 --> 03:21:21.512]  My sister Grace, may her soul rest in peace, lost three quarters of her hand as a kid.
[03:21:23.041 --> 03:21:25.882]  I write about it in my Zizi book, when Zizi gave Honey Boy.
[03:21:25.922 --> 03:21:28.382]  We lived in the Bronx, and they put the cast on wrong.
[03:21:29.923 --> 03:21:33.864]  She fell off a bike, broke her arm, and gangrene set in at 12 years old.
[03:21:34.404 --> 03:21:35.544]  She lost three quarters of her hand.
[03:21:37.885 --> 03:21:40.985]  I'm only like, you know, 5'7", you know?
[03:21:41.545 --> 03:21:43.246]  I'm not that big.
[03:21:43.726 --> 03:21:44.846]  I was a premature baby.
[03:21:44.866 --> 03:21:45.807]  I was in an incubator.
[03:21:46.487 --> 03:21:50.168]  My brothers and sisters, my sister was like 5'9", my sister Grace, you know?
[03:21:50.268 --> 03:21:51.768]  Brothers over six feet, my dad.
[03:21:52.941 --> 03:21:58.643]  Anyway, my sister opened up, you ready?
[03:21:59.603 --> 03:22:04.765]  Maybe she lost three quarters of a hand.
[03:22:04.805 --> 03:22:07.206]  Second topless go-go lounge in New York City.
[03:22:08.646 --> 03:22:09.006]  See that?
[03:22:10.807 --> 03:22:12.067]  Race's Lucky Lounge.
[03:22:14.528 --> 03:22:15.868]  And I was a bartender there.
[03:22:18.029 --> 03:22:19.450]  And this is back in the 60s, like 1968.
[03:22:21.837 --> 03:22:24.278]  And the mafia, they were big back then, they left her alone.
[03:22:24.918 --> 03:22:26.999]  Because she was a woman, an Italian woman.
[03:22:28.900 --> 03:22:33.903]  So, I'm mentioning that I want to become an inmate in a nursing home, because she was in the best place.
[03:22:35.864 --> 03:22:42.047]  And every time I went to see her, she had two strokes in dementia.
[03:22:45.508 --> 03:22:47.389]  I brought her up here, she became a different person.
[03:22:48.530 --> 03:22:51.171]  And somebody taking care of her 24 hours a day, she was painting outside.
[03:22:52.722 --> 03:22:56.947]  So when I say you got to get into best health, I'm not going to end up as an inmate in a nursing home.
[03:22:58.228 --> 03:23:03.193]  And that's why I'm talking about the products that they have available at InfoWars.
[03:23:04.675 --> 03:23:07.277]  And before I forget, she was there from 1968 to 1984.
[03:23:07.317 --> 03:23:08.859]  And then she opened up in Florida, House of Babes.
[03:23:15.822 --> 03:23:19.965]  I used to say to my sister, what brother could want a better sister than you?
[03:23:19.985 --> 03:23:24.648]  I was a bartender at Lucky Lounge at 22 years old.
[03:23:25.108 --> 03:23:26.649]  She got choo-choo eyeballs.
[03:23:26.669 --> 03:23:29.431]  She got hair down below and knees come together.
[03:23:29.591 --> 03:23:29.871]  Yeah.
[03:23:29.931 --> 03:23:35.996]  Well, anyway, going back, you need to get in the best shape you can.
[03:23:37.076 --> 03:23:40.739]  I read to you the death levels of people in the United States.
[03:23:40.839 --> 03:23:43.340]  Guys dying in their mid-70s.
[03:23:45.126 --> 03:23:48.108]  And InfoWars has the products that could help you do this.
[03:23:48.929 --> 03:23:50.270]  Again, the products are part of it.
[03:23:50.890 --> 03:23:51.911]  But again, it's up to you.
[03:23:51.931 --> 03:23:55.894]  You've got to exercise, you've got to watch what you're eating, and you've got to do the best.
[03:23:55.934 --> 03:23:57.074]  That doesn't mean you can't eat.
[03:23:57.395 --> 03:24:04.720]  I mean, I just had some nice prosciutto and some peppers that I grew in the garden over here.
[03:24:04.760 --> 03:24:08.322]  Just fried a couple of those little prosciutto, some olive oil, you know.
[03:24:09.223 --> 03:24:11.865]  Again, I eat meat every now and then, but I, you know,
[03:24:12.304 --> 03:24:14.905]  But you gotta get in good health and they have the products to help you.
[03:24:15.326 --> 03:24:18.827]  And they have this, it's been gone a while, but it's back now.
[03:24:19.448 --> 03:24:22.209]  And you really need it now because it says all what it is.
[03:24:22.769 --> 03:24:23.410]  Bodies!
[03:24:24.290 --> 03:24:29.252]  And it's a perfect answer to whole body support.
[03:24:30.353 --> 03:24:35.315]  And you get it now, it's back in stock, it was gone a while, and you get 25% off.
[03:24:36.096 --> 03:24:36.916]  And where does it have it?
[03:24:37.096 --> 03:24:40.338]  It got, it's used as a medicinal herb,
[03:24:41.138 --> 03:24:43.700]  The thousands of years in tumeric.
[03:24:45.001 --> 03:24:49.584]  Everybody that knows anything about anything knows is one of the most important studied ingredients known today.
[03:24:50.224 --> 03:24:59.891]  So they pair this with black pepper and so bodies is tumeric supplement and helps take advantage of the power of tumeric with over 95% of its active ingredients.
[03:25:01.151 --> 03:25:09.237]  And because this tumeric contains some of the most powerful antitoxin, antioxidants, info was decided, you know,
[03:25:10.075 --> 03:25:21.262]  The whole group over there that knows all about this in the health area, they put, they paired it with other powerful ingredients, including five different herbs and extracts, and you get the ultimate boost.
[03:25:22.282 --> 03:25:24.023]  And not only for you, but for your family.
[03:25:24.664 --> 03:25:27.245]  Because you gotta get in the best shape you can, as I said.

[03:26:06.818 --> 03:26:09.901]  At InfoWars Life.

[03:26:12.183 --> 03:26:13.304]  You go to InfoWars Store.
[03:26:14.485 --> 03:26:14.885]  All right.
[03:26:16.687 --> 03:26:22.652]  You know, I want to show you what they're... By the way, talking about the health of people, this just came out.
[03:26:23.312 --> 03:26:27.756]  Deep inside the Amazon rainforest, scientists uncover the key to longer living.
[03:26:28.116 --> 03:26:30.218]  We found zero cases of Alzheimer's.
[03:26:30.959 --> 03:26:32.881]  Yeah, because the people aren't eating crap food.
[03:26:32.901 --> 03:26:34.502]  And they're exercising.
[03:26:35.550 --> 03:26:37.232]  People are dead on their cell phones.
[03:26:37.852 --> 03:26:39.293]  They're walking down the street.
[03:26:39.333 --> 03:26:40.254]  I don't own a cell phone.
[03:26:40.274 --> 03:26:41.335]  I have an old flip phone.
[03:26:41.635 --> 03:26:42.436]  I don't carry a thing.
[03:26:43.277 --> 03:26:46.219]  Once upon a time, we used to go to bars and people used to talk to each other.
[03:26:46.259 --> 03:26:46.839]  Not anymore.
[03:26:47.460 --> 03:26:48.040]  Not anymore.
[03:26:49.301 --> 03:26:51.283]  You go to the bartenders, they don't talk to you anymore.
[03:26:51.964 --> 03:26:52.944]  People walking down the street.
[03:26:52.964 --> 03:26:53.765]  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[03:26:56.247 --> 03:26:58.189]  So, going back to the economy.
[03:27:00.010 --> 03:27:01.752]  Go back a little couple of weeks ago.
[03:27:02.632 --> 03:27:04.374]  When you saw the Nikkei dive
[03:27:05.508 --> 03:27:11.670]  The worst dive it ever had in the history of the world since the Nikkei's been alive.
[03:27:12.890 --> 03:27:14.550]  Back, went back, went back.
[03:27:14.970 --> 03:27:16.051]  Markets are all going down.
[03:27:16.151 --> 03:27:17.491]  Oh, everything is back.
[03:27:17.931 --> 03:27:18.951]  Everything is back.
[03:27:19.831 --> 03:27:20.012]  Yep.
[03:27:20.492 --> 03:27:21.232]  Everything's back.
[03:27:21.732 --> 03:27:24.633]  And they're going to do everything they can to keep it back.
[03:27:25.773 --> 03:27:26.273]  Because.
[03:27:26.293 --> 03:27:34.515]  They're going to do everything they can to pump up the economy in the run up to the presidential reality show.
[03:27:35.311 --> 03:27:36.912]  And that's all it is to me.
[03:27:37.533 --> 03:27:41.315]  It's a reality show and it's a freak show.
[03:27:41.996 --> 03:27:43.537]  So they're going to keep it going.
[03:27:44.617 --> 03:27:52.843]  And the media is just going to keep selling its BS and stupidity that they keep putting out there, which means nothing about anything.
[03:27:54.624 --> 03:28:01.769]  And this is like this headline story yesterday in CNN, the Cartoon News Network.
[03:28:04.008 --> 03:28:16.073]  How doctors and the Katamine Queen took advantage of Matthew Perry and played a role in his death, according to prosecutors.
[03:28:17.393 --> 03:28:22.135]  First of all, who is Matthew Perry and what the hell do I care?
[03:28:22.596 --> 03:28:23.856]  This is a big story.
[03:28:23.876 --> 03:28:28.138]  Hey, how about all the Palestinians that are being killed?
[03:28:28.838 --> 03:28:29.999]  Over 40,000 of them, and 70%
[03:28:34.483 --> 03:28:37.045]  Not a peep about peace.
[03:28:37.065 --> 03:28:38.046]  Not a peep about peace.
[03:29:06.727 --> 03:29:09.048]  Imagine if the billionaires put money up for peace.
[03:29:10.189 --> 03:29:14.111]  We'd have peace tomorrow, but they're just pieces of greedy crap.
[03:29:14.771 --> 03:29:16.292]  Oh, stop it, Selenki!
[03:29:16.792 --> 03:29:21.935]  We're gonna build huge caskets and take all those billions with us!
[03:29:22.635 --> 03:29:26.397]  I only have $125 billion, I want $140 billion!
[03:29:27.098 --> 03:29:29.299]  What a bunch of scum!
[03:29:30.419 --> 03:29:35.522]  What low-life scum every one of you billionaires are!
[03:29:36.667 --> 03:29:38.188]  Not a penny for peace!
[03:29:38.968 --> 03:29:47.213]  And, you pieces of crap, we're having a peace rally over here in Kingston, New York, on September 28th.
[03:29:47.313 --> 03:29:47.653]  Yep.
[03:29:51.815 --> 03:29:53.476]  Yeah, pro-Palestinian, pro-yeah, yeah.
[03:29:54.257 --> 03:30:04.322]  Again, we're having a peace rally on September 28th up here in Kingston, New York, on the four corners of Freedom, John and Crown Street,
[03:30:05.402 --> 03:30:09.263]  It's the oldest corner in America with pre-revolutionary war stone buildings.
[03:30:09.503 --> 03:30:10.143]  The only place.
[03:30:10.963 --> 03:30:11.843]  And I have three of them.
[03:30:12.163 --> 03:30:15.164]  And that's why I'm holding it here, because the seeds of democracy was sown here.
[03:30:15.484 --> 03:30:16.924]  You go to Occupy Peace.
[03:30:17.645 --> 03:30:19.105]  Occupypeace.com.
[03:30:19.785 --> 03:30:21.005]  Scott Ritter will be here.
[03:30:22.046 --> 03:30:23.546]  Judge Napolitano will be here.
[03:30:26.246 --> 03:30:29.047]  Max Blumenthal will be here.
[03:30:29.067 --> 03:30:31.348]  Anya Parampil will be here, and others.
[03:30:32.668 --> 03:30:33.008]  But again,
[03:30:34.062 --> 03:30:35.602]  They're giving you nothing in the media.
[03:30:35.622 --> 03:30:36.623]  There you go.
[03:30:37.263 --> 03:30:37.923]  It's right up there.
[03:30:40.443 --> 03:30:46.205]  And InfoWars is giving you everything they can and much, much more.
[03:30:46.485 --> 03:30:48.945]  Oh, by the way, I've read this before, but I'm going to read it again.
[03:30:49.865 --> 03:30:55.727]  George Washington, it is our policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world.
[03:30:56.587 --> 03:30:58.847]  Observe good faith and justice toward all nations.
[03:30:59.448 --> 03:31:01.208]  Cultivate peace and harmony with all.
[03:31:02.045 --> 03:31:03.806]  Go to hell, Washington!
[03:31:04.146 --> 03:31:04.947]  Who are you?
[03:31:05.907 --> 03:31:08.288]  I'm little Barack Obama!
[03:31:09.609 --> 03:31:10.069]  Yeah!
[03:31:10.469 --> 03:31:11.590]  With a pecker like that!
[03:31:11.610 --> 03:31:17.633]  I allied my way into office as a peace candidate.
[03:31:18.414 --> 03:31:20.875]  And I got the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner.
[03:31:21.775 --> 03:31:27.458]  Soon as I got in there, launched the Afghan Troop Surge.
[03:31:27.658 --> 03:31:28.779]  Oh, the Afghan Troop Surge?
[03:31:30.922 --> 03:31:32.083]  The surge that you lost?
[03:31:33.103 --> 03:31:34.784]  Oh, remember that guy Petraeus?
[03:31:34.884 --> 03:31:35.525]  Betrayed us?
[03:31:35.565 --> 03:31:36.705]  Another arrogant boy.
[03:31:36.725 --> 03:31:37.946]  Oh, he was ahead of that.
[03:31:39.187 --> 03:31:41.028]  Yeah, what crime syndicate is he working for now?
[03:31:41.048 --> 03:31:43.209]  I think one of the venture capitalists?
[03:31:48.939 --> 03:31:51.861]  The nation which indulges toward another habitual hatred.
[03:31:52.342 --> 03:31:53.602]  I hate those Russians.
[03:31:54.443 --> 03:31:55.924]  I hate them Iranians.
[03:31:56.064 --> 03:32:02.549]  They taught us, they taught us to hate the Russians when I was a kid that was hiding under a desk in case an atom bomb went off.
[03:32:02.949 --> 03:32:04.290]  Like that was going to save your life.
[03:32:04.651 --> 03:32:05.751]  Yes, Salenti it would.
[03:32:06.092 --> 03:32:14.638]  Just like standing six feet apart when COVID's out because the wind blows exactly in straight lines and six feet.
[03:32:15.310 --> 03:32:16.831]  Does it go six feet one inches?
[03:32:17.311 --> 03:32:17.491]  Nope.
[03:32:18.032 --> 03:32:18.552]  Does it go up?
[03:32:18.592 --> 03:32:19.212]  Does it go down?
[03:32:19.272 --> 03:32:20.073]  Does it go around?
[03:32:21.314 --> 03:32:29.278]  Imagine scaring the hell out of little kids, having us hiding under a desk in case an atom bomb went off.
[03:32:31.700 --> 03:32:35.362]  They hate to say to Russians, so observe good faith and justice toward all nations.
[03:32:35.782 --> 03:32:37.523]  Cultivate peace and harmony with all.
[03:32:37.903 --> 03:32:42.166]  The nation which indulges toward another habitual hatred or an habitual fondness
[03:32:43.257 --> 03:32:45.799]  is in some degree a slave.
[03:32:47.240 --> 03:32:51.303]  It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection.
[03:32:53.025 --> 03:32:54.486]  We hate those Russians.
[03:32:54.566 --> 03:32:55.987]  We hate those Iranians.
[03:32:56.707 --> 03:32:58.629]  Oh, but Israel has the right to defend itself.
[03:32:58.909 --> 03:33:00.010]  Nobody else does.
[03:33:00.931 --> 03:33:05.955]  Oh, and America can kill anybody that they want, anywhere, because we're bringing freedom and democracy.
[03:33:06.535 --> 03:33:07.556]  What hypocrisy.
[03:33:08.236 --> 03:33:10.178]  Again, these are our founding fathers.
[03:33:10.718 --> 03:33:13.040]  This country, this country has taught
[03:33:13.422 --> 03:33:17.643]  This guy, he's a bartender at this great place.
[03:33:17.703 --> 03:33:20.964]  It's called the Hudson House on the Hudson River over here in West Park.
[03:33:21.924 --> 03:33:23.845]  It's a distillery, Hudson Distillery.
[03:33:23.865 --> 03:33:24.825]  It used to be a monastery.
[03:33:24.845 --> 03:33:26.025]  They call it a real cool place.
[03:33:26.045 --> 03:33:27.166]  This guy's from Poland.
[03:33:27.186 --> 03:33:28.326]  We're talking yesterday.
[03:33:29.246 --> 03:33:31.587]  And he grew up when the whole Polish Revolution was going on.
[03:33:34.588 --> 03:33:36.928]  He got arrested for protesting.
[03:33:37.448 --> 03:33:38.149]  They beat him up.
[03:33:38.589 --> 03:33:43.210]  He said, they punched me, threw me to the ground, kicked me, threw me into prison.
[03:33:45.468 --> 03:33:49.592]  And the people eventually won.
[03:33:52.354 --> 03:33:59.179]  He said, now America has become that communist country that I left.
[03:34:02.522 --> 03:34:08.707]  You're doing the same thing, robbing you of your freedom of speech, forcing you to do things you don't want to do.
[03:34:09.147 --> 03:34:10.508]  No jab, no job.
[03:34:13.190 --> 03:34:13.891]  One after another.
[03:34:16.983 --> 03:34:19.164]  America, he says, becoming the country that I left.
[03:34:20.545 --> 03:34:21.686]  And he said, where are the people?
[03:34:23.347 --> 03:34:24.388]  How come they're not fighting?
[03:34:24.408 --> 03:34:27.890]  I said, I don't know the fight.
[03:34:27.910 --> 03:34:30.432]  I sound like a different cat.
[03:34:30.612 --> 03:34:31.673]  I grew up in the Bronx.
[03:34:31.733 --> 03:34:33.194]  It was a little Napolitano.
[03:34:33.634 --> 03:34:34.454]  You don't mess with us.
[03:34:34.495 --> 03:34:36.096]  We're very passionate, kind people.
[03:34:36.656 --> 03:34:37.436]  Don't mess with me.
[03:34:37.857 --> 03:34:38.797]  I don't tell you what to do.
[03:34:38.817 --> 03:34:39.778]  Don't tell me what to do.
[03:34:41.124 --> 03:34:43.925]  I tell this story, I was a premature kid.
[03:34:44.385 --> 03:34:47.106]  I come home crying, I'm like six years old, seven years old.
[03:34:47.126 --> 03:34:48.607]  My father, what are you crying about?
[03:34:48.627 --> 03:34:50.148]  I said, I got beat up.
[03:34:51.008 --> 03:34:52.148]  You don't come home crying.
[03:34:52.168 --> 03:34:57.090]  Yeah, I became the toughest kid.
[03:34:57.911 --> 03:34:59.411]  Cuz the bullies go for the littlest kid.
[03:34:59.611 --> 03:35:00.351]  I was the fastest.
[03:35:00.371 --> 03:35:01.812]  When you're small, you're fast.
[03:35:02.132 --> 03:35:03.233]  I gotta get on him right away.
[03:35:03.253 --> 03:35:06.714]  But again, I had my own school, taught close combat for a lot of years.
[03:35:09.497 --> 03:35:11.798]  Any one of these politicians, come over here and tell me what to do.
[03:35:12.198 --> 03:35:14.678]  Come over here and tell me what to do, and try to make me do it.
[03:35:16.198 --> 03:35:18.819]  Get this in your head, you're a public servant, you little piece of crap.
[03:35:23.660 --> 03:35:30.462]  Talking me forward, the gentleman from InfoWars, and we're talking about term limits.
[03:35:31.562 --> 03:35:34.702]  Yeah, there used to be this old movie, Mr. Smith Went to Washington, or something like that.
[03:35:34.722 --> 03:35:37.343]  He was there for two sessions and he got out.
[03:35:38.484 --> 03:35:42.127]  You got Biden's been sucking off the public what for all his whole life?
[03:35:44.589 --> 03:35:46.050]  And is the clown telling us what to do?
[03:35:46.070 --> 03:35:49.152]  It's one jerk after another.
[03:35:51.694 --> 03:35:53.655]  And they're just telling us what to do and how to do it.
[03:35:55.597 --> 03:36:01.081]  So we have to fight for freedom, because if we don't, we lose and they win.
[03:36:02.282 --> 03:36:02.422]  Yeah.
[03:36:03.228 --> 03:36:04.949]  This is from the Cartoon News Network.
[03:36:05.289 --> 03:36:09.230]  Ukraine's stunning strike into Russia has altered the path of the war.
[03:36:09.810 --> 03:36:10.330]  No, it hasn't.
[03:36:11.610 --> 03:36:12.971]  This is one thing that just happened.
[03:36:13.611 --> 03:36:14.911]  It didn't alter the path of the war.
[03:36:22.053 --> 03:36:27.255]  So now, going on to what's going on.
[03:36:29.258 --> 03:36:36.842]  After meeting with Lincoln, Netanyahu backs U.S.-Gaza proposal that includes his demands.
[03:36:38.943 --> 03:36:39.783]  This just came out.
[03:36:42.965 --> 03:36:48.627]  He released a statement backing the new Gaza hostage and ceasefire proposal from the U.S.
[03:36:49.048 --> 03:36:55.871]  which includes the Israeli leader's demands that doesn't include a permanent truce.
[03:37:00.672 --> 03:37:02.493]  So Hamas is not going to agree to this.
[03:37:03.453 --> 03:37:10.316]  And the United States is going to sell the lie that we had an agreement and they didn't agree with it.
[03:37:10.817 --> 03:37:18.700]  So we're going to send them more weapons of death to keep slaughtering innocent people and bomb Gaza into ruins.
[03:37:22.882 --> 03:37:24.723]  And that's the way it's going to work out.
[03:37:26.144 --> 03:37:27.064]  You mark my words.
[03:37:29.105 --> 03:37:29.245]  Yep.
[03:37:32.759 --> 03:37:33.619]  It's going to happen.
[03:37:35.820 --> 03:37:36.841]  It's going to happen.
[03:37:41.122 --> 03:37:44.724]  There's not going to be any peace agreement.
[03:37:45.504 --> 03:37:50.506]  I just had something here that I just saw from, I think it was the Jerusalem Post.
[03:37:50.546 --> 03:37:53.087]  I'm not sure where it came from.
[03:37:53.187 --> 03:37:54.108]  Yeah, let me see.
[03:37:54.988 --> 03:38:01.811]  That says yesterday, Hamas said that they wouldn't go along with it.
[03:38:02.392 --> 03:38:02.992]  Yeah, here we go.
[03:38:03.573 --> 03:38:05.173]  Hamas rejects U.S.
[03:38:05.633 --> 03:38:10.936]  bridging offer as Blinken lands in Israel to advance hostage deal.
[03:38:11.656 --> 03:38:14.717]  So they said yesterday that they would not agree to this.
[03:38:15.757 --> 03:38:20.319]  And now today, this is how they sell the lies or the hypocrisy.
[03:38:21.040 --> 03:38:24.141]  They say Netanyahu agreed to it.
[03:38:25.201 --> 03:38:29.163]  Let's go back to November when they had a temporary ceasefire.
[03:38:30.020 --> 03:38:36.603]  And Hamas brought back all of those, a lot of, a couple, like over a hundred hostages.
[03:38:37.684 --> 03:38:47.668]  As soon as they returned the hostages, Israel went back to destroying Gaza and their murderers, rampage, full force.
[03:38:50.229 --> 03:38:53.771]  Again, this is why you subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[03:38:54.594 --> 03:39:00.279]  And watch Infowars rather than the crap that they sell in the mainstream media.
[03:39:00.859 --> 03:39:03.762]  This is from the Cartoon News Network, just before I went on the air.
[03:39:04.142 --> 03:39:04.402]  CNN.
[03:39:04.422 --> 03:39:07.105]  This is the main story.
[03:39:07.185 --> 03:39:09.206]  Again, nothing about the slaughter going on.
[03:39:09.767 --> 03:39:19.175]  When I went on the air, there wasn't a word, maybe it's on there now, about the ceasefire, the deal with Hamas and Israel.
[03:39:19.895 --> 03:39:21.277]  This is the headline.
[03:39:21.797 --> 03:39:22.377]  Front story.
[03:39:23.903 --> 03:39:28.326]  At least one dead after tornado sinks luxury yacht.
[03:39:29.266 --> 03:39:33.168]  Source says British tech tycoon is among the missing.
[03:39:33.849 --> 03:39:34.869]  Who is Mike Lynch?
[03:39:35.530 --> 03:39:41.073]  A tech entrepreneur among the missing after a super yacht sank.
[03:39:42.173 --> 03:39:43.054]  A super yacht?
[03:39:44.375 --> 03:39:45.955]  What the hell do I care about this?
[03:39:46.676 --> 03:39:48.657]  Who the hell is this guy and why do I care?
[03:39:50.071 --> 03:39:52.072]  Come down, Salenti!
[03:39:52.733 --> 03:39:54.193]  We're prostitutes!
[03:39:55.114 --> 03:39:56.775]  We're media whores!
[03:39:57.355 --> 03:40:02.758]  We get paid to put out by our corporate pimps and government whoremasters.
[03:40:03.398 --> 03:40:05.039]  Swallow this crap!
[03:40:05.800 --> 03:40:07.921]  We don't want to give you news you can use.
[03:40:09.001 --> 03:40:10.622]  Screw you and your trends.
[03:40:12.043 --> 03:40:12.743]  So what?
[03:40:13.824 --> 03:40:14.484]  So what?
[03:40:14.544 --> 03:40:17.146]  You said this would be a golden year for gold.
[03:40:18.058 --> 03:40:20.439]  CNBC won't have you on!
[03:40:21.920 --> 03:40:24.381]  Somebody died in a yacht and they were rich!
[03:40:25.121 --> 03:40:28.123]  You're just a plantation worker, a slave landlier!
[03:40:28.623 --> 03:40:31.104]  Oh my god, a rich person died!
[03:40:31.124 --> 03:40:34.126]  Oh, I don't care, I'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight!
[03:40:35.106 --> 03:40:36.767]  And they show this crap!
[03:40:37.667 --> 03:40:41.970]  Hey, why don't you show the Palestinians being slaughtered?
[03:40:42.830 --> 03:40:44.891]  Oh no no, you anti-Semite!
[03:40:46.016 --> 03:40:47.677]  As I said, don't call me anti-Semite.
[03:40:48.057 --> 03:40:51.039]  Every one of my Jewish friends except one is against what's going on there.
[03:40:51.619 --> 03:40:53.841]  And three of my last four girlfriends were Jewish.
[03:40:55.341 --> 03:40:58.143]  And you know why Jewish men die before their wives?
[03:40:59.144 --> 03:40:59.764]  They want to.
[03:40:59.784 --> 03:41:00.825]  It's a joke.
[03:41:00.865 --> 03:41:01.585]  I didn't make that up.
[03:41:01.605 --> 03:41:02.386]  So take it easy.
[03:41:02.646 --> 03:41:03.326]  Take it easy.
[03:41:05.627 --> 03:41:06.448]  What else do we have here?
[03:41:09.189 --> 03:41:09.510]  You ready?
[03:41:10.190 --> 03:41:13.452]  This is the other top Cartoon News Network story.
[03:41:14.375 --> 03:41:26.160]  Retired Federal Appeal Court Judge Michael Luddig, a prominent conservative legal scholar, on the bench of George H.W.
[03:41:26.200 --> 03:41:38.705]  Bush, is endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris over former President Donald Trump, whose candidacy he describes as an existential threat to American democracy.
[03:41:39.105 --> 03:41:42.326]  D-U-H-M-O-C-K-R-A-C-Y.
[03:41:42.606 --> 03:41:44.027]  Who the hell is this guy?
[03:41:45.117 --> 03:41:46.218]  Who the hell is he?
[03:41:50.000 --> 03:41:51.001]  He's a prominent!
[03:41:51.441 --> 03:41:52.762]  He's a prominent!
[03:41:53.162 --> 03:41:54.603]  Oh, he's so prominent!
[03:41:54.863 --> 03:41:55.804]  What prominent?
[03:41:56.564 --> 03:41:58.325]  Some guy in the system?
[03:41:59.086 --> 03:42:01.007]  That probably sucked his way into it?
[03:42:02.188 --> 03:42:03.989]  What the hell do I care what this guy says?
[03:42:04.469 --> 03:42:05.430]  How about what I think?
[03:42:06.291 --> 03:42:09.152]  Not what you think, what we tell you to think.
[03:42:09.673 --> 03:42:09.953]  Again,
[03:42:13.012 --> 03:42:18.176]  You go to the Cartoon News Network, you go to MSNBC, you get their side of the story.
[03:42:18.196 --> 03:42:20.197]  You go to Fox, you get their side of the story.
[03:42:20.217 --> 03:42:22.359]  You go to Breitbart, you get their side of the story.
[03:42:22.939 --> 03:42:26.241]  When you go to the Trends Journal, you get the true side of the story.
[03:42:27.622 --> 03:42:31.345]  We tell you what they're saying, and then we give you our analysis.
[03:42:33.586 --> 03:42:33.767]  Yep.
[03:42:39.290 --> 03:42:39.891]  And then again,
[03:42:41.394 --> 03:42:43.975]  Blinken, Netanyahu said he supports U.S.
[03:42:44.335 --> 03:42:46.696]  bridging proposal for Gaza deal.
[03:42:47.937 --> 03:42:48.977]  Now up to Hamas.
[03:42:49.958 --> 03:42:51.899]  Again, it's not a bridging proposal.
[03:42:54.400 --> 03:42:56.040]  They need a complete ceasefire.
[03:42:56.761 --> 03:42:57.801]  I am for peace.
[03:42:59.002 --> 03:43:01.803]  Was it taking you 10 months to stop this damn thing?
[03:43:03.744 --> 03:43:07.405]  Oh, and go to your Trends Journal how we said they're gonna go nuclear?
[03:43:07.666 --> 03:43:09.766]  Or they attacked a nuclear power plant over there?
[03:43:09.786 --> 03:43:10.747]  The Ukrainians?
[03:43:14.781 --> 03:43:20.382]  Again, if we don't have peace, it's going to be annihilation.
[03:43:23.502 --> 03:43:27.643]  We got crazy demonic people running and ruining the world.
[03:43:27.663 --> 03:43:29.363]  Yep.
[03:43:33.704 --> 03:43:34.584]  It's a freak show.
[03:43:40.485 --> 03:43:43.006]  We got crazy demonic people.
[03:43:43.086 --> 03:43:44.026]  Who's your favorite one?
[03:43:46.025 --> 03:43:50.390]  By the way, GM lays off more than 100 salaried software and service employees.
[03:43:50.791 --> 03:43:52.813]  The jobs that are being created stink.
[03:43:52.833 --> 03:43:56.537]  They're in the service sector, healthcare sector, they don't pay anything.
[03:43:58.580 --> 03:44:05.688]  So again, we're facing the most dangerous socioeconomic and geopolitical times in my lifetime.
[03:44:06.340 --> 03:44:10.042]  So do what you can to get in the best shape you can, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[03:44:10.662 --> 03:44:16.165]  And a lot of the products are going to help you that InfoWars has at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:16.645 --> 03:44:17.886]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:18.386 --> 03:44:23.849]  And if you want to know what in the world is going on, what to do, and what's next, you want the Trends Journal, TrendsJournal.com.
[03:44:24.550 --> 03:44:24.990]  See you soon.
[03:44:35.816 --> 03:44:43.862]  I want to tell you the story, the history of InfoWars MD, one of our biggest and most important lines of high quality supplements.
[03:44:44.863 --> 03:44:48.626]  Because it's a story of political attacks and not giving up.
[03:44:49.086 --> 03:44:51.268]  And it's an amazing product line that funds our operation.
[03:44:52.109 --> 03:44:57.533]  Going back about three years ago, during all the deplatforming of InfoWars, not just off the internet, not just with banking,
[03:44:58.593 --> 03:45:07.160]  Some of the big supplement manufacturers that we were using, some of the best in the country, had been bought up during the pandemic, during the shutdown, and then they would notify us.
[03:45:07.500 --> 03:45:09.362]  We had five companies making product for us.
[03:45:09.982 --> 03:45:14.486]  Three of them notified us that we're no longer going to work with you because you're Alex Jones and you're InfoWars.
[03:45:15.207 --> 03:45:20.871]  So we made a lot of phone calls, reached out to our contacts, and we found one of the biggest supplement makers in the country.
[03:45:20.891 --> 03:45:23.774]  I'm not going to say their names, they get harassed, but they're big listeners.
[03:45:24.594 --> 03:45:26.116]  And they said, listen, you know
[03:45:27.321 --> 03:45:43.312]  We were supplying a lot of the raw materials to several of your manufacturers that are no longer doing business with you, and we would love to put out a private label where we just put your label on our product, and then when people order from you, it drops ships out of our warehouses.
[03:45:43.692 --> 03:45:50.377]  And so we added a bunch of their products to our lineup, and I didn't ever really promote them a lot because we were selling
[03:45:51.454 --> 03:45:51.995]  We're good to go.
[03:46:03.357 --> 03:46:11.459]  In fact, in some cases, like in the case of Nitric Boost, it's the exact same formula that we private-labeled from them before we're even doing InfoWars MD with them.
[03:46:11.540 --> 03:46:22.903]  So case in point right now, our version of Nitric Boost, so good for your heart and body and cardiovascular system, cleans out your blood, Dr. Minkiewicz has talked about being one of the best formulas out there, our version of it sold out about three weeks ago.
[03:46:23.103 --> 03:46:32.887]  Well, their version is just a white bottle from their warehouse, and it's the exact same pill, the exact same people, does the exact same thing, and it's the exact same price.
[03:46:33.508 --> 03:46:35.909]  So, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[03:46:35.969 --> 03:46:37.009]  Take Turmeric 95.
[03:46:38.710 --> 03:46:45.413]  Turmeric 95 isn't called that because it's the strongest curcuminoid concentrate, 95% that they can make.
[03:46:45.533 --> 03:46:51.175]  And it turns out that's the company, years ago, and I wanted to put out the strongest turmeric available that was actually producing it.
[03:46:51.295 --> 03:46:59.799]  So, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, sold out at InfoWarsWare.com, but not their Turmeric 95, which is the same 95% curcuminoid and the same ingredients that boost it.
[03:46:59.859 --> 03:47:02.280]  So that's why InfoWars MD is such an amazing line, and
[03:47:03.567 --> 03:47:16.853]  Because the bankruptcy attempts to shut us down, and the bad CRO we had here before, who would not reorder product, we would not have any new product to sell to stay on air if we hadn't set this up with InfoWars MD.
[03:47:17.334 --> 03:47:21.736]  Now, they've got over 100 products, and as we speak, we're making labels for the rest of their line.
[03:47:21.796 --> 03:47:26.438]  But 17 of their products that are their best sellers, the top of their catalog, we do have
[03:47:27.459 --> 03:47:32.682]  So I've told you some of the history, what's behind it.
[03:47:32.782 --> 03:47:33.403]  It's amazing.
[03:47:33.523 --> 03:47:34.443]  It's super high quality.
[03:47:34.523 --> 03:47:36.365]  Here's just a few of the things that are available.
[03:47:56.678 --> 03:47:57.158]  Thank you.
