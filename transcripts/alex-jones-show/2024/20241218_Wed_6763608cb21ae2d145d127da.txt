[00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.659]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.799]  It is Wednesday, December 18th, 2024. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:49.799]  We're only 33 days out from the inauguration of President Trump, and the globalist deep state is in high gear trying to destabilize our planet.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:20.579]  Top Russian General Igor Kirilov, the head of their chemical, biological, radiological, weapons, defense, and offensive programs, who has been extremely critical of the West biological weapon program that's now been confirmed in Congress to have been going on inside of Ukraine illegally,
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.900]  because it was illegal inside the United States.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.219]  And so Obama fired it up during his first administration over there.
[00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:41.969]  And this Russian general came out two years ago with all the documents and exposed how the United States and other NATO countries were building all these high level bioweapon labs over the past few decade plus in Russia.
[00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:50.510]  And then Congress asked Victoria Newell and others about it and they had to admit it after the corporate media and the fact checkers had tried to deny it.
[00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.549]  And so he was one of the top targets of NATO through their proxy force to Ukrainians.
[00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.670]  And yesterday, as he walked out of his apartment, a moped scooter was filled with plastic explosives and killed him and his aide.
[00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.950]  So this is another massive escalation of the war.
[00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.709]  The Russians say it's a huge escalation.
[00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.469]  They'll be retaliating somehow.
[00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.189]  But that's what happens when you expose the globalists and their big bioweapons programs.
[00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:20.469]  Here's a short clip of him with subtitles on Russian TV last year talking about these issues and more.
[00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:28.319]  This is a huge broadcast today with myself, Mike Adams, and some massive guests he's got, as well as Chase Geyser and others.
[00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:29.819]  I'll be back with more big reports.
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.419]  But again, the war just continues to escalate with pray for peace and that we don't end up all dying in thermonuclear war.
[00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.219]  The growth and illness caused by atypical infections has been noted in a number of countries right now.
[00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:47.020]  So can we say this is the result of some help from American biologists?
[00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.020]  He says, we can't say this so indiscriminately.
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.860]  We are public officials, after all.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.000]  As for biological weapons, if we assess the damage caused by COVID, these are the subtitles I'm reading.
[00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:09.159]  Over the course of two years around the world, the main pandemic lasted two years.
[00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:17.550]  It cannot even be compared with the damage from World War II. It is dozens of times greater.
[00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.449]  However, those who make the profits such as Big Pharma...
[00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.389]  She says, do you mean all the pharmaceutical companies?
[00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.409]  He says, yes, the profits of the pharma companies, which are mainly in the USA, are colossal.
[00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.330]  That's the way it is, he says.
[00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.889]  So the question is, the question is being asked, we provide documents?
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.199]  I'm reading the transcription here.
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.460]  The reaction of the USA that we are talking about is typical.
[00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.639]  There has not been a single refutation of the documents we presented.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.199]  He says, this is Kurilov.
[00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:03.719]  We sent more than 2,000 pages of these documents to the United Nations.
[00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.639]  What sort of reply did you receive, she asks.
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:24.449]  We usually get two replies, a standard one from the USA. All, quote, all that is done is in the interest of the national security of the USA, end quote.
[00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:26.850]  And you must trust us.
[00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.769]  Trust them blindly, she asked.
[00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.230]  He says, yes, trust them blindly.
[00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.889]  They have a policy of global biological control.
[00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:44.319]  They understood that this works and that by creating an artificial crisis, or artificial crises, plural, which are biological in nature, they can rule the world.
[00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:46.160]  There's nothing they do for free.
[00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:55.779]  Even when they provide supplies to certain states free of charge, they are not as free of charge as they say.
[00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.329]  All right, this is Mike Adams here hosting for Alex Jones.
[00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.389]  The Alex Jones Show will be right back after this break with the full episode.
[00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:05.949]  Stay tuned.
[00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:09.350]  All right, welcome to the Alex Jones Show broadcast.
[00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.050]  I'm Mike Adams filling in for the first two hours today.
[00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.170]  We've got an incredible show lined up for you.
[00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:18.350]  It's going to be incredibly just packed with information and breaking news.
[00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.350]  And let me just give you a heads up of some of the guests we have joining us.
[00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.470]  At the bottom of this hour, we have Jeffrey Prather joining us for analysis of the drone situation.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.120]  And what he says may be continuity of government operations shaping up.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.019]  There's a lot of interpretation of that.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:44.240]  If I get a chance, I'll also bring you information about the potential for missing so-called suitcase nukes.
[00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:45.519]  Is that a real thing?
[00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:51.959]  Would they even work today, decades later, because of the decay of the tritium in them?
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.740]  Would they even function?
[00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:54.959]  We're gonna cover that if we get a chance.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:12.379]  At the bottom of, well, the second half of this hour, we're also gonna be joined by Jason Fick, who is our expert consultant on the lawsuit that my company filed against the censorship industrial complex earlier this year.
[00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:26.939]  Now this week, Ty and Charlene Bollinger from The Truth About Cancer They have also filed an expanded lawsuit against the censorship industrial complex, which is actually self-destructing at this very minute.
[00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:30.579]  So we'll have a segment from Jason Fick with some interpretation about that.
[00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:37.139]  And the State Department's Global Engagement Center, the GEC, now apparently tearing itself down.
[00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:48.589]  Then, at the top of the second hour, we're gonna be joined by Bitcoin Jesus, Roger Ver from Spain, who may not actually be able to speak.
[00:06:48.810 --> 00:07:05.009]  He's with Tracy Thurman, who I interviewed separately, to introduce us to the full story of why the United States government is attempting to prosecute Roger Ver because he opposes CBDCs and he promotes and supports decentralization.
[00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:09.259]  Technologies through cryptocurrency and many other means.
[00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.800]  So that's a big deal.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.439]  Again, he's known as Bitcoin Jesus.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.660]  He is the co-author of the book, Hijacking Bitcoin.
[00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:20.360]  And that's gonna be a bombshell interview coming up.
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.699]  And then at the bottom of the second hour, we're gonna be joined by Aaron Day.
[00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:42.750]  Who is also a crypto and privacy crypto advocate with a talk about central bank digital currencies, how we can reclaim our liberty and privacy in this time when it's clear that the powers that be are trying to completely enslave us and put us under an obedience control grid.
[00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:50.649]  Now, with that said, part of the methods that the deep state is using to do that includes trying to whip up war with Russia.
[00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:58.750]  And this brings us to the assassination of Igor Kurilov, who was just killed with a detonation.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.240]  Alex just had the special report there.
[00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:15.240]  He was just killed by, apparently, a Ukrainian-hired assassin who put explosives into a scooter and then manually detonated it as General Korilov was leaving his apartment.
[00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:36.870]  Now, General Igor Korilov is a specialist in biological weapons, and it appears that he was the top person who was attempting to blow the whistle on the West's We're good to go.
[00:08:45.009 --> 00:08:51.710]  It's generally believed, I would say by most of us in the independent media, that the State Department is running Ukraine.
[00:08:52.090 --> 00:09:02.710]  And the State Department through Jake Sullivan and of course Blinken and others, we believe are running most of the Ukrainian operations, certainly providing the funding to Ukraine.
[00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:09.669]  And apparently this attempted, well, this assassin was paid reportedly $100,000.
[00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:15.149]  In order to carry out this assassination of Kurilov.
[00:09:15.409 --> 00:09:35.730]  And that assassination succeeded, which means that they're able to cover up now whatever Kurilov was about to expose, or through the documentation that Russia has that they were going to present to international bodies such as the United Nations, describing America's involvement in illegal bioweapons,
[00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:41.389]  Research and manufacture and testing on human populations.
[00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:53.289]  Now, if you think about it here at Infowars, Alex has had numerous guests on who specifically talk about the violations of bioweapons research that the United States has engaged in.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.220]  So this is a very big deal.
[00:09:55.659 --> 00:10:07.799]  And personally, I also believe that one of the reasons why the West is so desperate to win this conflict between Ukraine and Russia is to continue to cover up the bioweapons laboratories operations.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:25.740]  Think about also the fact that Joe Biden is looking into reportedly a pardon of Fauci and possibly others, possibly even Collins, former head of NIH, who we believe Fauci and Collins and many others were involved in the cover up.
[00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:45.259]  Of the SARS-CoV-2 gain-of-function operations, sending that intellectual property and specimens to the Wuhan labs with funding in order to add gain-of-function to that, and then to transform that into biological weapons that were inserted into the vaccines to kill Americans,
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.620]  which they did.
[00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:58.230]  According to experts like Ed Dowd and others who have been guests on this show, those estimates of The number of Americans killed now range from 1.2 million to 1.5 million.
[00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.309]  That's Americans only.
[00:10:59.549 --> 00:11:01.950]  Globally, that number is in the tens of millions.
[00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:11.350]  Those are very, very credible numbers based on increases in death rates, reduction in longevity, and death records as they are happening.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.299]  So think about how all of this fits together.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:29.960]  We've got biological weapons development happening illegally in the bioweapons labs in Ukraine, funded by the West since 2014, when the color revolution coup run in part by Victoria Nuland was taking place in Ukraine.
[00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:45.340]  And also, of course, continuing to pose an increasing threat to Russia by placing more aggressive medium range missiles Nuclear capable Western missiles, moving those towards Ukraine, into Ukraine.
[00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:53.799]  The US taking itself out of the weapons bans, the treaties, the medium range missile treaties in particular.
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:59.379]  Those have been rejected by the United States even during the Trump administration.
[00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:13.429]  So then Russia feeling more threatened, launching the special military operation in 2022, and then beginning to seize the Donbass region geography in which those bioweapons labs existed.
[00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:30.710]  So now the fear from NATO and the West and the fear from the Biden administration is that Russia may have its hands on the damning smoking gun evidence of the bioweapons development by the West that violated international treaties,
[00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:35.570]  that violated the basic laws of humanity.
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:43.940]  Essentially proving that the United States of America engaged in bioweapons crimes against humanity.
[00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:48.159]  So I know I just said a lot right there, but I'm trying to pull all this together.
[00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:53.200]  If you wonder why Igor Kurilov was just assassinated, that's probably why.
[00:12:53.639 --> 00:13:02.100]  He probably had smoking gun evidence that was damning to the West involving the bioweapons labs in Ukraine that the West has been trying to cover up this entire time.
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.000]  So that's my analysis.
[00:13:04.379 --> 00:13:05.960]  You are free to agree or disagree with that.
[00:13:06.059 --> 00:13:09.460]  But that's what I believe is coming to the surface here right now.
[00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:17.809]  Now, when we have Jeffrey Prather on at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to ask for his analysis of this as well.
[00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.970]  Actually, we may go to him sooner than that because he's standing by.
[00:13:22.169 --> 00:13:25.029]  We'll go to him in just a minute for his analysis of that.
[00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:33.029]  Let me mention the drone situation, a couple of really important stories that I have to bring to your attention from years past.
[00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:47.090]  We have from 2021 Welcome to my show!
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.820]  Recent mystery drone incident.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:07.840]  Now, over the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona, in 2021, there were mysterious drones that were intercepted or attempted to be intercepted by Tucson police.
[00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.830]  With a helicopter.
[00:14:10.169 --> 00:14:14.870]  In addition, the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base Air Traffic Control was alerted to this incident.
[00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.990]  They tried to chase this drone and they were unable to.
[00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:23.789]  This drone outlifted, outmaneuvered the police helicopters.
[00:14:24.129 --> 00:14:32.250]  That was 2021. And this article from TWZ.com is showing that there was a similar incident five years earlier.
[00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:45.710]  So now, from today in 2024, with what's happening in New Jersey, New York, Back to eight years ago, we now have at least an eight year span of these mysterious drone craft.
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:52.120]  And I do want to say I believe that what's in the skies over New Jersey is not just one type of drone.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:15:00.159]  My best guess right now is that there are these mysterious drones that were appearing in Tucson years ago.
[00:15:00.379 --> 00:15:05.740]  And then there are the US military drones trying to intercept those drones.
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:11.820]  So there are warring drones in the skies over New Jersey as best I can tell based on current information.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.720]  But here's the thing.
[00:15:13.309 --> 00:15:26.090]  There are numerous FAA reports out of F-35 pilots who flew in training grounds, restricted areas of training in Arizona.
[00:15:26.429 --> 00:15:35.769]  They filed reports, this was all covered by the war zone, where they were documenting drones traveling at.75 Mach, okay?
[00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:41.009]  So we're talking 560 miles per hour, roughly, drones.
[00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:52.509]  560 miles per hour drones that can attain an altitude of 39,000 feet and that were apparently outmaneuvering the F-35s.
[00:15:53.299 --> 00:15:55.940]  So this is all public record stuff here, folks.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.179]  This is all filed with the FAA. Numerous reports.
[00:16:00.539 --> 00:16:06.419]  Again, TWZ.com, which is a reputable publisher of military technology news.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:18.840]  They have covered this in great detail over these years, going all the way back even five years before 2021. And then finally, a couple headlines, and then we'll go to Jeffrey Prather here in just a second.
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:26.159]  This now news story, mysterious drones swarmed Langley Air Force Base for weeks.
[00:16:26.659 --> 00:16:37.240]  That is something that was reported earlier this year, but the Langley Air Force Base in Chesapeake Bay, the war zone has been investigating those incidents.
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.820]  The Air Force has confirmed that they did indeed occur.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.480]  We're good to go.
[00:16:57.769 --> 00:17:13.329]  Claims that the FBI, and this is a DailyMail.com report, the FBI is confirming this, a NASA and FBI report on previous airbase incursions and an account from a senior officer briefed on the incidents.
[00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:16.869]  This is all covered in the UK Daily Mail report.
[00:17:17.049 --> 00:17:17.410]  I've got it.
[00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:18.609]  Yeah, there's a headline right there.
[00:17:19.009 --> 00:17:22.549]  Now, with all of that said, time is short today.
[00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:26.980]  Jeffrey Prather, Was kind enough to join us for a quick update.
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.519]  Mr. Prather, sir, welcome to the show today.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:30.839]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:17:31.099 --> 00:17:34.259]  What is your analysis of what's happening with these drones?
[00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:37.069]  Well, thanks for having me.
[00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.009]  I agree with everything you're saying.
[00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.769]  I've got a couple things to add.
[00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:46.069]  Of course, I was in Tucson for a long time, very familiar with Davis-Monthan.
[00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:52.710]  But my tactical training company, Warrior School, used to do Raytheon's security work.
[00:17:52.829 --> 00:17:54.390]  And so I still had a clearance back then.
[00:17:54.410 --> 00:18:17.880]  So I had access We're good to go.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.259]  If you were doing low-profile stuff, you'd use something like the Dragonfly.
[00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:25.359]  So these drones are not that at all.
[00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:26.900]  Clearly not that.
[00:18:27.119 --> 00:18:37.700]  But the drone being chased by Tucson PD, who I did a lot of work with, also, I would assess almost 100% came out of Raytheon's bike shop.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:48.450]  And what you're seeing is the intelligence community testing new techniques and methods And proprietary technology on the military.
[00:18:48.750 --> 00:19:00.789]  Remember, the first drones came out of an Israeli citizen, probably sponsored by Mossad, who created the Predator, went to CIA. Eventually, the Predator was armed.
[00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:10.109]  And the Predator is just now retiring, but it's been the workhorse of the CIA and then SOCOM, Special Operations Command, for a long time.
[00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:29.940]  Wait a minute, Jeffrey, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I wanna clarify, are you saying that you believe that the initial wave of these drones and the drones that have been hovering over military assets in Tucson and New Jersey and other places, you believe these are military industrial complex corporation drones made by US companies,
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:38.220]  but somehow those drones are not necessarily known by all of the levels of the military people and government people in New Jersey and other states?
[00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:52.349]  I would assess 100% certainty that the military may not know about them, but the intelligence community, the CIA, the NSA, the NRO know about them for sure and that they're running the test on those.
[00:19:52.509 --> 00:20:07.190]  For example, the New Jersey drones, Fort Dix, McGuire Joint Base has an Aerotechnology Defense Cooperation Agreement since 2020 to detect and follow drones.
[00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:11.609]  So I'm pretty sure that they're coming off of there, and these are test runs.
[00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.089]  Okay, okay, well, hold on just a second.
[00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:29.430]  But to clarify then, you do not believe at all that these are Chinese drones, or as that one congressman sort of ridiculously said, I thought they were Iranian drones from an Iranian mothership that Iran purchased from China that was parked off the US coast, which we all thought was a clown show.
[00:20:32.129 --> 00:20:49.730]  Well, again, that's part of the SIOP. So the intelligence agencies, if you just showed the insectocopter, the little dragonfly, if you wanted to detect radioactive material and they said there was a Cat 3 container in New Jersey that was lost,
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.900]  Which I don't buy.
[00:20:51.019 --> 00:20:58.420]  I think that's a cover story, just like the Wuhan lab was a cover story for the Fortidrick-Darpa-Arta bioweapon.
[00:20:58.559 --> 00:20:59.960]  I think that's a cover story.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.259]  You don't do it lit up.
[00:21:01.299 --> 00:21:02.339]  You don't do it with lights on.
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.240]  You don't obey FAA regulations.
[00:21:04.519 --> 00:21:06.259]  You do it very low profile.
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:13.619]  And Nest Nuclear Emergency Response Team and Tier 1 DOE guys, they've been doing this a long time.
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.119]  They can do it real low profile to not alert anybody.
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.200]  But they're not.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:30.440]  What do you make then of the fact that these drones then, which apparently you're describing as really advanced Corporate-built exotic technology drones.
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:35.180]  Apparently, they don't have a thermal signature is what we're hearing from lawmakers in New Jersey.
[00:21:35.759 --> 00:21:38.460]  And apparently, they don't show up on radar.
[00:21:39.019 --> 00:21:47.720]  Otherwise, we would have known, even the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base air traffic control, they would have known the origination vector of these and where they went off to.
[00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:49.279]  Nobody knows that.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:53.559]  How is it that they can evade radar and have no thermal signature, apparently?
[00:21:54.730 --> 00:22:00.049]  Well, remember, we didn't see stealth Blackhawks until the Bin Laden raid.
[00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:08.809]  So that was probably revealed by the intelligence community, probably the CIA, for JSOC, Joint Special Operations Command, for that.
[00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.650]  But they keep these things under wrap.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:25.819]  If you remember the 1952 fake where there were UFOs over the Capitol dome building, that was the story reported by the guys operating the radar equipment, but there were no photographs taken.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.980]  That photograph and that video has been proved a fake.
[00:22:29.099 --> 00:22:37.220]  They took the lamps from below the Capitol, reversed them, and put them exactly where those images are and then moved them across.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.019]  They just have better tech now.
[00:22:39.329 --> 00:22:47.529]  But part of this is all a PSYOP. And the first part of the PSYOP is so that you're looking up and thinking about drones, drones, drones.
[00:22:47.710 --> 00:23:05.500]  So you're not thinking about the last four years where our government has been trafficking children, trafficking women, trafficking arms and terrorists into the country and kidnapping and is still doing that, that there are military flights now flying in where the border has It receded a bit,
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:11.660]  where military flights are still flying in likely known terrorists for more.
[00:23:11.799 --> 00:23:17.740]  So that's the first part of it is it's asylum, because if you wanted to collect intelligence, you'd do it low profile.
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:22.720]  So because it's not low profile, it's an intelligence, it's a information influence operation.
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.440]  But what is the end goal?
[00:23:24.599 --> 00:23:26.579]  I'm sorry to keep interrupting you, but our time is really short.
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.599]  What's the end goal?
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.720]  You mentioned a distraction strategy, I get that.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:48.140]  But that doesn't seem to be enough of a motivation for something this big to happen where you have a weapons corporation that has just decided to do whatever the heck it wants over the skies of American cities with the population be damned and the lawmakers be damned.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.559]  Nobody was read in on this apparently at the local level, right?
[00:23:51.759 --> 00:23:53.980]  So they must have a bigger end goal.
[00:23:54.119 --> 00:23:54.660]  What is that?
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:24:06.140]  Well, the corporations are doing this at the behest of the CIA, the intelligence community, the deep state, make no mistake, and they're just classifying it at very high levels.
[00:24:06.319 --> 00:24:22.309]  But the other end goal of this is to maybe bring in some kind of bombing Pre-inauguration or maybe even after inauguration so that a continuity of government and a dark journalist talked about this on Alex Jones the other day.
[00:24:22.769 --> 00:24:25.690]  So a continuity of government can come in with Northcom.
[00:24:26.529 --> 00:24:36.650]  That is a very viable solution because they don't want Trump's DOJ to start coming after them because they've mass murdered millions with the bioweapon.
[00:24:37.009 --> 00:24:40.869]  They've trafficked children in the tens, maybe the hundreds of thousands.
[00:24:40.869 --> 00:24:56.140]  So they want to distract from If they can turn the DOJ and the DOD onto some kind of external threat, where it's Iranians or Russians, and I think this is also why Kirilov was killed as well, because Kirilov was also their nuclear expert.
[00:24:56.299 --> 00:25:02.700]  So now they can start to build the legend that there were loose nukes or SATIMs.
[00:25:02.869 --> 00:25:08.109]  So small atomic demolition munitions were as a special forces mission that they were actually jumpable.
[00:25:08.289 --> 00:25:18.910]  People, special forces, Green Berets, haloed, high altitude, low opened, test nukes for dip, die in place missions behind enemy lines.
[00:25:19.049 --> 00:25:20.190]  They tried to get away and everything.
[00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:22.369]  But those things exist.
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:42.380]  So they may try and do that with drones or simulate that pre-inauguration or even after inauguration so that all of a sudden there's the rally around the flag phenomena and they're not focusing on the evil pedophiles and pushers and pimps of the pedo Joe and Joe's pedos,
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:46.859]  but they're suddenly focusing on Iran or Russia if they can do that.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:56.089]  So by killing Kirilov, They say, well, maybe the Russians, CBRN, chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, is not under control.
[00:25:56.369 --> 00:25:57.529]  It got loose.
[00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:04.509]  It got over here in some drones because these are likely Ukrainian drones because the State Department runs Ukraine.
[00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.269]  That means the CIA runs Ukraine.
[00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.529]  Ukrainians have been known for two things, sniping.
[00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:13.529]  They claim a two-mile sniper hit on a Russian soldier and drones.
[00:26:13.769 --> 00:26:19.009]  And Trump even intimated this the other day when he said, I I don't think I'll stay overnight in bed, Minister.
[00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:22.650]  What he was saying there was, maybe they're going to hit me with a drone.
[00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:26.990]  But, Jeffrey, you're saying these so-called suitcase nukes do exist.
[00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:34.529]  And perhaps one or more is unaccounted for across the United States.
[00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:45.150]  It seems to me like one of the most effective ways for the deep state to really distract people and cause panic and activate COG plans would be to actually detonate one of these.
[00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:46.509]  And I looked them up.
[00:26:46.630 --> 00:27:04.009]  Apparently, they're around one kiloton equivalent of TNT. One kiloton, I did the research, Jeffrey, that would blow a crater that is about Up to 100 feet deep and 200 feet wide, it's only a fraction of the size of Hiroshima,
[00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.609]  let's say.
[00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:11.490]  It's small compared to modern ICBMs, but it's not inconsequential to have a one kiloton explosion in the middle of a city.
[00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.849]  Do you think they're desperate enough to try something like that?
[00:27:15.049 --> 00:27:15.490]  I do.
[00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:19.250]  I was thinking it would be in the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, but it could be done here.
[00:27:19.769 --> 00:27:21.309]  Or it could just be simulated.
[00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.250]  It wouldn't even have to be a nuke.
[00:27:23.349 --> 00:27:30.250]  Remember the Oklahoma bombing, which Ted Gunderson, the FBI expert, said the FBI was running.
[00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:30.849]  I apologize.
[00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.789]  We have to go to break.
[00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:32.569]  Stay with us, Jeffrey.

[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.299]  The judge said you're actually gonna sell it to who actually offers the most money.
[00:29:18.759 --> 00:29:24.079]  We're gonna work on that with outside groups that won't censor us, but who knows what Soros and Bloomberg are gonna do.

[00:30:11.259 --> 00:30:12.180]  All right, welcome back.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:24.839]  We are finishing up with Jeffrey Prather here, a former DIA and former DEA whistleblower, now working for the people, has been for several years at his website, jeffreyprather.com.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:30.140]  He's got outstanding analysis, and I think he shared some of that with us here today.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:37.500]  Mr. Prather, just kind of wrapping this up, how would you put an end cap on the PSYOP that you were just alluding to?
[00:30:37.779 --> 00:30:45.250]  What can we expect, in your view, Between now and Inauguration Day based on the drone activity we've seen so far.
[00:30:45.809 --> 00:31:02.109]  We can expect a bombing or a simulation of bombings either at our embassy in Kyiv or across the country to activate continuity of government via Northcom or to distract even more DOJ,
[00:31:02.289 --> 00:31:07.029]  an incoming DOJ from the crimes and sins of this administration.
[00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:14.450]  And I just sent you a picture of an old green light program, Green Beret, haloing a satum.
[00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:21.829]  These drones, which are definitely deep state drones, are SUV-sized drones.
[00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:27.589]  So if a Green Beret can halo one, an SUV-sized drone can definitely...
[00:31:28.619 --> 00:31:30.140]  Move one of those around.
[00:31:30.339 --> 00:31:39.440]  It doesn't even have to be for real, because again, it's all a PSYOP. Just like COVID was a PSYOP, COVID was the flu, the real thing was the PSYOP that shut everything down.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.259]  And so that's what they're trying to do with that, in my estimation.
[00:31:42.599 --> 00:31:45.539]  All right, I think your analysis is spot on.
[00:31:45.759 --> 00:31:47.000]  I appreciate you, Jeffrey.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:55.269]  And let me mention your website again, jeffreyprather.com, and it's spelled J-E-F-F-R-E-Y. Don't forget the E in Jeffrey.
[00:31:55.609 --> 00:31:57.009]  So thank you, Mr. Prather.
[00:31:57.289 --> 00:32:01.730]  Thank you for all the service that you've offered to our constitutional republic.
[00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:03.150]  And I look forward to speaking with you again.
[00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:03.769]  Be safe.
[00:32:04.829 --> 00:32:05.890]  Thanks for having me back, Mike.
[00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:06.450]  All right.
[00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.390]  Thank you.
[00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:15.609]  I'd like to ask our producers also, cue up if you would that video, the public service announcement of New York City that they put out two years ago.
[00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:21.970]  It was a 90 second PSA about the nuclear, if there was a nuclear detonation.
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:25.500]  In New York City, what you were supposed to do.
[00:32:25.759 --> 00:32:34.119]  We're gonna play that after this special report right now that Alex has just sent us about Elon Musk.
[00:32:34.259 --> 00:32:41.420]  So let's go to that special report and then we'll be back with the New York City Public Service announcement of what you're supposed to do if a nuke goes off in New York City.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:47.339]  The deep state declared war on Elon Musk and now he's declared war on them.
[00:32:58.979 --> 00:33:02.619]  Something astonishing came out in the last 24 hours.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.160]  But if you've been under attack by this system, it's not astonishing.
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:19.380]  It's something that I've been viciously attacked In the last eight plus years, at a level unprecedented except for President Trump and now Elon Musk.
[00:33:20.359 --> 00:33:36.799]  And that is the entire military industrial complex, disinformation complex, CIA system, Operation Mockingbird 2.0, that spends billions of dollars a year targeting individuals that are populist,
[00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:39.220]  that are pro-human, that are anti-globalist.
[00:33:40.339 --> 00:33:45.960]  And when I got designated as a Russian agent with no evidence eight plus years ago, they even had congressional hearings just saying it.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.400]  And I wasn't invited, I couldn't defend myself.
[00:33:48.839 --> 00:33:56.599]  They then triggered the foreign disinformation, countering foreign disinformation propaganda act against myself and Trump and others.
[00:33:56.819 --> 00:34:05.049]  And several billion dollars we know of was spent Targeting us through PR firms, through major publications like Reuters, AP, and others.
[00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:11.269]  Well, now it's come out that an astounding, that is astounding, the number, 300 million alone.
[00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:15.650]  This is now in congressional reports, because Trump's coming into office, the documents are now coming out.
[00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:23.849]  Targeting Elon Musk for total destruction, attacking all of his companies, lying about him, just making up completely fake stories.
[00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:27.730]  So this is a big, big deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:28.369]  It's criminal.
[00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.289]  It's criminal racketeering.
[00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:36.670]  And it's what was done to me with all the disinformation pieces that you've seen and countless others to a smaller level.
[00:34:36.809 --> 00:34:40.420]  But when you see somebody being attacked by this system, You know they're over the target.
[00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:41.480]  You know they're the good guys.
[00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:44.039]  We'll be covering this more in the day, but this is a big issue.
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:59.519]  Elon Musk has now discovered that the deep state, the US intelligence agencies, the Biden administration, spent $300 million in one ad buy we know of, planning fake stories about Elon Musk, his family, his companies, and more.
[00:34:59.719 --> 00:35:05.860]  This is criminal racketeering, and Musk has come out and said, look, Deep State's coming after me with their paid shills.
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.139]  I don't start fights, but I finish them.
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.860]  So they've declared war on him.
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:11.380]  He has accepted the challenge.
[00:35:12.599 --> 00:35:15.099]  They need to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
[00:35:15.199 --> 00:35:20.179]  This is illegal to engage in domestic propaganda and target US sentences between government corporations.
[00:35:20.179 --> 00:35:22.980]  It is classic mafia racketeering.
[00:35:23.559 --> 00:35:28.659]  And this just shows how threatened the system is by Elon Musk, myself and Donald Trump.
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:34.260]  If you're not under attack by the globalists, you are not over the target.
[00:35:34.869 --> 00:35:42.969]  So things are gonna get very, very interesting, very, very quick, and the system is very, very scared because they thought they were invincible, and they've committed so many crimes that make your head spin.
[00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:45.190]  Look at what we already know.
[00:35:45.329 --> 00:35:46.630]  Look at what we've already experienced.
[00:35:46.869 --> 00:36:02.730]  Imagine what we don't know once Trump gets in there and puts Kash Patel in as the FBI director, Tulsi Gabbard in as the head, Director of National Intelligence and so much more, RFK Jr. over HHS. I mean, this is a real revolution against tyranny.
[00:36:02.809 --> 00:36:03.750]  This is so exciting.
[00:36:10.579 --> 00:36:13.320]  All right, a very powerful message there from Alex Jones.
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.920]  And thank you for continuing with us here.
[00:36:15.039 --> 00:36:15.619]  I'm Mike Adams.
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.880]  We're about to bring on our guest Jason Fick here shortly.
[00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:28.940]  I want to remind you of the importance of supporting this network and visit the alexjonesstore.com to check out their nutritional products.
[00:36:29.139 --> 00:36:38.099]  They've got one called Optimal Human that has a combination of adaptogens and stress support and immune strength plus all-day energy as well.
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:41.260]  And look, I'm the health ranger, right?
[00:36:41.519 --> 00:36:43.500]  I'm the publisher of Natural News.
[00:36:43.639 --> 00:36:46.000]  You know I've been doing this for 25 years.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:59.059]  And I cannot tell you the importance of nutrition for cognitive health, for longevity, for immunity against everything that's being spread around our world right now and people shedding on other people and so on.
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:02.619]  Get to thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:37:02.719 --> 00:37:04.760]  Check out the nutritional products they have there.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.480]  Again, Optimal Human has these adaptogens.
[00:37:08.019 --> 00:37:16.159]  I have spent decades studying the beneficial supportive effects of these phytonutrients, such as adaptogens.
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:23.139]  And what I've found over the years is that the formulators for the Infowars product line really know their stuff.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:30.960]  So check it out again, thealexjonesstore.com, and that's how you help support this network, which is critical for human freedom and liberty.
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.760]  All right, one more thing, real quickly now.
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.619]  We're gonna play about a minute from this New York City Public Service announcement.
[00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:47.949]  Where they put this out two years ago, really the summer of 2022, telling people what to do in case of a nuclear detonation in New York City.
[00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:52.309]  And when this came out, I remember all of us, including Alex, we were going, what?
[00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:54.050]  Why are they putting this out?
[00:37:54.150 --> 00:38:00.369]  But let's just play about a minute of that right now to get a flavor of what New York City was telling its own people two years ago.
[00:38:00.489 --> 00:38:00.929]  Check this out.
[00:38:09.539 --> 00:38:11.340]  So there's been a nuclear attack.
[00:38:11.619 --> 00:38:15.840]  Don't ask me how or why, just know that the big one has hit, okay?
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.719]  So what do we do?
[00:38:18.059 --> 00:38:20.960]  There are three important steps that I want you to remember.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.739]  Step one, get inside fast.
[00:38:25.219 --> 00:38:28.360]  You, your friends, your family, get inside.
[00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:31.719]  And no, staying in the car is not an option.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.079]  You need to get into a building and move away from the windows.
[00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:41.050]  Step 2. Stay inside.
[00:38:41.409 --> 00:38:43.289]  Shut all doors and windows.
[00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:44.650]  Have a basement?
[00:38:44.969 --> 00:38:45.750]  Head there.
[00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:50.630]  If you don't have one, get as far into the middle of the building as possible.
[00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.889]  If you were outside after the blast, get clean immediately.
[00:38:56.389 --> 00:39:02.670]  Remove and bag all outer clothing to keep radioactive dust or ash away from your body.
[00:39:03.449 --> 00:39:05.769]  Step three, stay tuned.
[00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:08.230]  Follow media for more information.
[00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:24.690]  All right, I'm gonna cut it off right there because we mocked this PSA when it came out because it's telling you if there's been a nuclear detonation in New York City and you were outside when it happened, you're supposed to go inside, take off all your clothes and take a shower.
[00:39:25.159 --> 00:39:28.280]  As if somehow the showers still work just fine.
[00:39:28.619 --> 00:39:31.780]  And then wait for instructions from government.
[00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:34.980]  Right, because they want what's best for you.
[00:39:37.039 --> 00:39:38.000]  Yeah, come on.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:51.380]  But maybe now it's all becoming clear, because as Jeffrey Prather just told us, maybe, perhaps, I mean, we pray not, but possibly there is some kind of a Deep state detonation or a simulation of a detonation coming.
[00:39:51.699 --> 00:39:54.079]  Again, we pray that that does not occur.
[00:39:54.179 --> 00:39:56.679]  We pray for the safety of the American people.
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:57.860]  We pray for peace.
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:04.199]  And yet we know there are nefarious forces that are allied against us that are trying to escalate into war.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.679]  And they're also at war with the American people.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.659]  That's very clear.
[00:40:08.349 --> 00:40:13.409]  Now, we're gonna shift gears and we're gonna go to our next guest here, Jason Fick.
[00:40:13.489 --> 00:40:17.409]  Now, that war against the American people has involved a tremendous amount of censorship.
[00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:27.989]  There is a censorship industrial complex that has been constructed beginning during the Trump administration, not by Trump himself, but by the enemies of Trump.
[00:40:28.769 --> 00:40:41.829]  The State Department in particular, the DOD and other entities, big tech and overseas NGOs that all colluded to carry out deplatforming and the silencing of people like myself, like Alex Jones and others in independent media.
[00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:50.289]  And now, this week, Ty and Charlene Bollinger, you know from The Truth About Cancer, they have also filed a major lawsuit.
[00:40:51.409 --> 00:40:53.210]  Against the censorship industrial complex.
[00:40:53.369 --> 00:40:59.690]  And here, as the expert consultant, the expert on this entire issue is Jason Fick.
[00:40:59.829 --> 00:41:00.730]  Welcome, Jason.
[00:41:00.909 --> 00:41:02.289]  It's an honor to have you on the show today.
[00:41:03.369 --> 00:41:04.289]  Thank you for having me, Mike.
[00:41:04.869 --> 00:41:06.130]  Well, thank you for joining me.
[00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:11.090]  And time is tight today because there's so much breaking news, but please break it down for us.
[00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:16.969]  Talk about the dismantling of the censorship industrial complex and the lawsuit filed by The Truth About Cancer.
[00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:18.630]  What do we need to know?
[00:41:19.969 --> 00:41:26.230]  Well, there's three elements that we're working on in this dismantling of the censorship industrial complex.
[00:41:26.409 --> 00:41:39.329]  The first was Section 230 issues, which is at the heart of the power that the government had over big tech in order to effectuate the censorship issue.
[00:41:39.469 --> 00:41:47.150]  That, of course, Prior to, you know, Trump's first term, that's when you saw a lot of this, right?
[00:41:47.289 --> 00:41:50.309]  In your case, against the censorship industrial complex.
[00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:55.429]  Now, we took that very far and we uncovered a lot of it in the initial stages.
[00:41:55.690 --> 00:42:04.969]  However, obviously since that point, the tie-in, Charlene Bollinger, decided that they were going to take action against the censorship industrial complex.
[00:42:05.289 --> 00:42:12.690]  And I kind of look at them like your case is the first half of it, and their case really is relevant to the second half of it.
[00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:22.889]  Now, what I mean by that is that when you were censored, it was predominantly during the period when they were trying to get Donald Trump out of office, right?
[00:42:22.949 --> 00:42:25.949]  This was the 2020, up to the 2020 election.
[00:42:26.289 --> 00:42:31.730]  After the 2020 election, they went hardcore on the COVID misinformation realm.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.780]  At its core, you can find the Department of State.
[00:42:36.119 --> 00:42:39.119]  That's really the lead to this.
[00:42:39.239 --> 00:42:44.000]  And the reason for that was because of the formation of something called the Global Engagement Center.
[00:42:44.679 --> 00:42:55.559]  That element of government is what actually essentially evolved from foreign myths and disinformation to targeting domestic myths and disinformation.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:59.420]  And the problem there was that it was not myths and disinformation.
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.239]  It is exactly like the situations with Alex Jones.
[00:43:02.679 --> 00:43:13.010]  And with any notable figures like yourselves, the Bollingers, when they just You know, put out dissenting information, the government went after them.
[00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:18.130]  Now- Well, what we want to say, Jason, is that we were putting out missing information.
[00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:21.690]  This is information missing from the corporate media.
[00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:23.389]  They were covering it up and hiding it.
[00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:34.750]  And it's the job of independent media to ask the questions that the corporate media, which is run, influenced by the State Department or Pfizer or whoever, they refuse to cover it.
[00:43:34.889 --> 00:43:36.909]  So I just want to clarify that, but go ahead.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:41.860]  Yeah, that's a good way to describe it, is missing information.
[00:43:42.039 --> 00:43:52.300]  Effectively, you guys as citizen journalists and across the board, everybody that puts out information, It's filling in the gaps in order to give people informed consent.
[00:43:52.719 --> 00:43:56.219]  That's the whole point, especially when it comes to health-related issues.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:00.900]  I don't want the government making decisions for me that they think are the best for me.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:06.699]  I want to hear from everybody so that I can make my own logical decision about my own health concerns.
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:07.079]  Absolutely.
[00:44:07.179 --> 00:44:13.920]  Obviously, with you being the health ranger, does that not make the most sense to hear more information to make your own decisions?
[00:44:14.869 --> 00:44:16.849]  Well, it's all about decentralization of knowledge.
[00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:18.909]  This is a really critical issue right now.
[00:44:19.409 --> 00:44:21.929]  And it actually, let me bring up this headline too.
[00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:30.469]  Truth Social eyes a crypto powered FinTech, like a decentralized crypto solution to guard against debanking.
[00:44:31.119 --> 00:44:41.539]  So if you think about it, Jason, the independent media represents decentralization of knowledge, just as cryptocurrency represents decentralization of finance.
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:47.480]  Just as banks, banks were debanking people because of their viewpoints, because they were tied to Trump.
[00:44:48.139 --> 00:44:54.239]  And content platforms and social media platforms were deplatforming people because of their content or their viewpoints.
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:56.239]  So it's really the same issue across the board.
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:07.840]  So what you are doing, Jason, By fighting against the censorship industrial complex, you are really advocating for decentralization of knowledge, which is exactly what humanity needs to move forward.
[00:45:09.059 --> 00:45:19.320]  It's the primary concern is that if we can't decentralize knowledge, That's right.
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:53.579]  I've had almost seven years deep in this specific niche type of law, even though I'm not bar license.
[00:45:53.579 --> 00:46:00.179]  But I don't need to be to understand the law and to understand the manipulation of information here.
[00:46:00.579 --> 00:46:07.480]  Yeah, but Jason, I'm sorry to interrupt, but the point is, I want you to speak to the fact that the GEC is now shutting itself down.
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:07.940]  Yeah.
[00:46:08.239 --> 00:46:17.360]  I mean, talk about the dismantling of the censorship industrial complex because they're in a freaking panic right now in the next four weeks before Trump gets sworn in.
[00:46:17.559 --> 00:46:19.079]  Let's pray that we make it to that day.
[00:46:19.619 --> 00:46:22.420]  What is happening with the censorship industrial complex?
[00:46:22.539 --> 00:46:26.920]  Because they're trying to hide all the evidence, it seems, of what they did.
[00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:28.690]  So here's the thing.
[00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:39.849]  Even in these lawsuits where we're going after them to get information about what they did, discovery and so forth, for example, the GEC has a sunset clause.
[00:46:39.989 --> 00:46:44.630]  So they're not planning on re-upping it, so the Global Engagement Center is going to shut down.
[00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:47.050]  That does not mean it is going away.
[00:46:47.289 --> 00:46:56.099]  The pervasive entwinement that the government is engaged in It's so widespread, and it is not going anywhere.
[00:46:56.239 --> 00:47:03.940]  Everybody thinks that – well, I wouldn't say everybody thinks this, but a lot of people believe that just because Donald Trump is coming into office that he'll be able to stop all of it.
[00:47:04.079 --> 00:47:04.840]  He can't.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:15.579]  It's actually a fight for all of us to make at every turn because the corruption – to explain what the censorship industrial complex is, it's an amalgamous mess.
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.280]  It's everywhere.
[00:47:17.519 --> 00:47:19.579]  It's entwined in everything that we do.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:24.019]  So all they do is they just do next iterations of that.
[00:47:24.159 --> 00:47:27.039]  So in the case of GEC, it'll come out as something else.
[00:47:27.659 --> 00:47:38.380]  You look at the Stanford Internet Observatory, which is part of the Election Integrity Partnership, which, of course, morphed into the Rurality Project.
[00:47:38.639 --> 00:47:40.460]  And now they're shutting that down.
[00:47:41.559 --> 00:47:43.019]  It'll just morph into something else.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:47.400]  The problem is that we have to stop the government at its core.
[00:47:47.719 --> 00:47:58.719]  Yes, let me bring in, I believe yesterday in the House, what passed as part of the continuing resolution, I believe, included a provision to halt any government contracts with NewsGuard.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:47:59.980]  Did you see that story?
[00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:02.250]  I actually have not seen that.
[00:48:02.369 --> 00:48:06.289]  We were in the final hours of filing with the Bollinger's complaint.
[00:48:06.429 --> 00:48:07.010]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:24.630]  But I believe that that passed the House yesterday, which means that for the first time, our legislators are becoming aware of the dangers of these so-called Ratings or fact checkers, which are not really fact checkers, they are lie pushers in my view.
[00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:39.630]  They cover up the truth, they cover up the facts, but NewsGuard has specifically targeted conservative websites and truth oriented websites to be defamed and slandered.
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.559]  This was a deliberate effort.
[00:48:42.659 --> 00:48:44.039]  It was not unintentional.
[00:48:44.179 --> 00:48:45.699]  The government set out to do this.
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:51.480]  That was actually some of the revelations that we have in the existing case for the Bollingers.
[00:48:51.679 --> 00:48:54.380]  There are things that we found that are unbelievable.
[00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:58.619]  I mean it's a huge, huge lawsuit.
[00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:08.969]  A lot of people believe that the reaction was to the CCDH report where they were calling them the disinformation doesn't.
[00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:10.530]  It was not reactive.
[00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:13.369]  It turns out the government elicited it.
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:28.739]  It looked as that overtly where we saw in the news that they were going after the disinformation doesn't purportedly because they had 65% of the vaccine misinformation.
[00:49:29.039 --> 00:49:30.320]  That was complete falsehood.
[00:49:30.519 --> 00:49:37.280]  In fact, the data that was actually used was actually elicited by the government.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:42.880]  It was then given to these companies like the CCDH and they requisitioned it.
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:44.639]  Hey, we need this.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:59.739]  And the timing is unbelievable because they had pre-planned the March 25th hearing, and the 23rd, they had embargoed the report that had already been in the hands of the AGs, and then on the 24th, it goes live.
[00:50:00.059 --> 00:50:03.000]  So there is no doubt about it.
[00:50:03.079 --> 00:50:11.059]  The government was entwined with the NGOs, at least with CCDH and Facebook and Twitter, prior to any of this coming public.
[00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:18.260]  So We know for a fact that these companies are all working in collusion with the government.
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:24.699]  So therefore, and it's a maximum of law that basically says that what they cannot do themselves, they cannot buy others.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:28.900]  So the government can't indirectly go after free speech either.
[00:50:29.139 --> 00:50:29.739]  Let me interject.
[00:50:30.119 --> 00:50:32.880]  What you said is absolutely true, but let me add this element to it.
[00:50:33.139 --> 00:50:41.159]  We know, and this gets into the importance of crypto and an honest distributed ledger system that no government can counterfeit.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.239]  Think about this, Jason.
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:51:00.050]  During COVID, the United States government Printed fiat currency gave a billion dollars to the CDC, which the CDC then handed out to social media influencers, paying them with this counterfeit dollar currency to tell people to get vaccinated.
[00:51:00.489 --> 00:51:02.670]  And I believe they also paid church leaders.
[00:51:02.889 --> 00:51:09.929]  And so some of the church pastors that took donations from the government, they told their congregations go out and get vaccinated.
[00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:13.289]  And a lot of those People are dead now, by the way.
[00:51:13.449 --> 00:51:26.849]  And so money printing, combined with concentration and centralization of power over speech, combined with the censorship against those who are telling the truth, this results in mass death.
[00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:31.170]  You know how, Jason, they always say that, well, you're putting out information that could be dangerous?
[00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:34.190]  No, your censorship Censorship is violence.
[00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:39.849]  Your censorship is what caused people to die, a million plus people to die in this country.
[00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:47.829]  Isn't that true, Jason, that censorship is violence and fighting against censorship saves lives?
[00:51:48.929 --> 00:51:53.750]  Well, the point being is that if you put out more information, you are not censoring anybody.
[00:51:53.909 --> 00:51:55.050]  You're not withholding ideas.
[00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:57.429]  You are simply giving people more ideas.
[00:51:57.650 --> 00:52:01.969]  The difference was that the government sought to actually restrain ideas.
[00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:08.690]  They did not want anybody that would dissent from their version of the vaccine hesitancy and so forth.
[00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:12.190]  And therefore, that censorship, in fact, did kill people.
[00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:15.110]  More people are dead because of the government's actions here.
[00:52:15.469 --> 00:52:17.670]  And, I mean, it's pervasive.
[00:52:17.889 --> 00:52:26.610]  In fact, I think between your case and the Bollinger case, there is a much more important thing.
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:31.239]  Occurrence that needs to happen here.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:39.000]  The incoming DOJ, which will be an honest DOJ, we believe, needs to look into this.
[00:52:39.159 --> 00:52:41.340]  There are criminal aspects here.
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:46.880]  There are things that we have uncovered that warrant congressional investigations.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:57.000]  The pervasive nature of how all of these different entities are interacting, the point is it's not a single bad guy.
[00:52:58.359 --> 00:52:59.159]  It's everywhere.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:04.940]  To give you an example, we always talk about going down the rabbit hole.
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.579]  And we did.
[00:53:06.639 --> 00:53:07.719]  We went down the rabbit hole.
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:09.199]  But let me finish, Mike.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:13.000]  The point was, we went down that rabbit hole, and we never found the bottom.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:23.900]  Everywhere, we eventually had to get to the point it was so much information, so much pervasive censorship that we just had to stop and say, okay, here it is.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:24.920]  Here's what we found.
[00:53:25.139 --> 00:53:25.719]  It happened.
[00:53:26.059 --> 00:53:26.559]  Now what?
[00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:31.289]  Well, and the Bollinger's remember that they're known for being the truth about cancer.
[00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:41.630]  So they are saving people's lives from the cancer industry, which I believe profits from death and suffering and doesn't in the aggregate save any lives at all.
[00:53:42.550 --> 00:53:44.190]  Ty and Charlene Bollinger saved lives.
[00:53:44.489 --> 00:53:52.530]  And that's why they were targeted with the most nefarious aggressive tactics that you've uncovered, you and your team, in the lawsuit that's just been filed.
[00:53:52.889 --> 00:53:53.469]  Stay with us, Jason.
[00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:54.309]  We gotta take a break.
[00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:57.769]  We'll be back in two minutes to finish up with you.
[00:53:58.070 --> 00:53:59.329]  We're here on The Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:59.329 --> 00:54:00.090]  We'll be right back.
[00:54:00.369 --> 00:54:01.889]  This is a vital transmission.
[00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:03.949]  We are reaching tens of millions of new people a day.
[00:54:04.389 --> 00:54:07.929]  We are one of the most devastating operations of the globalists thanks to your support.
[00:54:09.969 --> 00:54:10.789]  We need to stay on air.
[00:54:10.969 --> 00:54:12.409]  I make it easy for you to do that.
[00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:16.409]  Do your Christmas shopping at thealexjonesstore.com and at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:21.409]  And I told you, we're not just going to have Patriot gear and great supplements that are amazing at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:25.389]  We're going to have made in America, designer knives, collectibles.
[00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:26.989]  We've already had that, but limited supplies.
[00:54:28.579 --> 00:54:34.840]  There's a huge Black Friday Cyber Week sale going 30 to 40% off on top of the big discounts right now.
[00:54:35.159 --> 00:54:36.760]  Do your Christmas shopping with us.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:40.219]  But some amazing new products just came in.
[00:54:41.219 --> 00:54:43.099]  And when I say amazing, I'm excited.
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:45.260]  I know these are going to go quickly.
[00:54:46.119 --> 00:54:52.170]  Unfortunately, This will solve all our problems, but they only made $2,000 in this limited edition.
[00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:58.269]  But it'll go a long way towards our lawsuits and funding our operations and the new network and everything else and keeping InfoWars on it.
[00:54:58.369 --> 00:54:59.090]  That continues.
[00:54:59.289 --> 00:55:00.110]  Look at this bad boy.
[00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:02.949]  The 1984 versus 1776 coin.
[00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:03.769]  I designed it.
[00:55:03.869 --> 00:55:10.190]  There's only 2,000 of these bad boys at TheAlexJonesStore.com and they are a fundraiser.
[00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:11.690]  They are a piece of history.
[00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:13.690]  They're pure silver.
[00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:16.449]  They are minted here in America.
[00:55:17.739 --> 00:55:18.940]  2,000 of these.
[00:55:19.219 --> 00:55:21.400]  I predict these sell out in just a couple days.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:25.760]  This is a great Christmas gift, a memento that you stood for the Republic at a critical time.
[00:55:26.039 --> 00:55:27.019]  They are incredible.
[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:33.800]  Get the 1984 versus 1776 coin at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:41.909]  And it's not, the store's not owned by me, so even if the globalists come after us, Even if they take over in fours next week, they're not going to shut down the Alex Jones store.com.
[00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:45.230]  That is our main sponsor with the Alex Jones Network and everything we're doing going into the future.
[00:55:45.389 --> 00:55:48.170]  So get this amazing coin now.
[00:55:48.369 --> 00:56:02.219]  And if you don't want to, don't have the money to get that because it's marked up for a fundraiser, a memento, a limited edition, We have challenge coins, a whole bunch of them, between 995 and 1495. When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty.
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.820]  And on the other side, it's got the Gadsden flag, don't tread on me.
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:07.920]  1776, another one with Alex Jones, yours truly on it.
[00:56:08.059 --> 00:56:10.960]  The answer to 1904 is 1776 with the Gadsden flag.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:13.500]  Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God on the other side.
[00:56:13.639 --> 00:56:15.320]  And there's some other great challenge coins as well.
[00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:18.469]  At thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:20.869]  Now, this is even more exciting.
[00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:22.130]  They surprised me with this.
[00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:23.210]  I just learned this morning.
[00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:27.610]  So it's in the mail from Arkansas where their factory is and their shipping department and all that.
[00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:29.909]  The big lead that owns and runs thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:35.070]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump on a Stump, 1995. Everybody loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:38.150]  This is Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:56:38.289 --> 00:56:40.170]  Oh, my daughter loves Elf on a Shelf.
[00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:41.949]  We play with him, do all sorts of stuff.
[00:56:42.669 --> 00:56:45.010]  Catapult around the house, play with the cats, play with them.
[00:56:45.489 --> 00:56:48.789]  We've probably got 15 of those elf on a shelf, both little elf village in the backyard.
[00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.590]  We have a lot of fun.
[00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:53.550]  She puts Christmas tree lights on these little trees we got in the backyard.
[00:56:53.869 --> 00:56:55.630]  Oh my gosh, I've got to have this.
[00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:56.449]  And I already called them.
[00:56:56.590 --> 00:56:58.590]  I said, I want 10 set aside for me.
[00:56:58.650 --> 00:56:59.489]  So that means there's...
[00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:02.989]  1,900 and something of these.
[00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:05.690]  And I'm telling you, this is going to sell out today.
[00:57:06.050 --> 00:57:08.090]  Why they didn't get 20,000 of them, I don't know.
[00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:09.349]  All my problems would be solved.
[00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:10.570]  We would have plenty of fun.
[00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:12.329]  This baby is amazing.
[00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:17.690]  Everybody needs to have this original Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.
[00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:21.590]  Celebrate Christmas with the Trump on a Stump Christmas figurine.

[00:57:33.119 --> 00:57:41.179]  Whether you're decking the halls or making a statement, this patriotic decoration will keep the spirit of 1776 alive all season long, right into Trump getting inaugurated next month.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:42.980]  Get your Trump on a stump now!
[00:57:43.219 --> 00:57:51.219]  Ultimate CMOS, Patriot gear, amazing hoodies, Christmas sweaters and more, and fun the second American Revolution worldwide at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:01.489]  All right, welcome back.
[00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:03.110]  We are here on The Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:05.889]  I'm Mike Adams with naturalnews.com.
[00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:12.710]  And my organization, Brighteon, filed a lawsuit against the censorship industrial complex earlier this year.
[00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:17.769]  And the expert consultant that we hired to do that is our guest right now, Jason Fick.
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:25.039]  Who also has been a consultant with the Bollingers, the Truth About Cancer organization that just filed a lawsuit this week.
[00:58:25.559 --> 00:58:38.300]  Jason, we only have a couple minutes here, but please let our audience know today, what's the most important takeaway from here about the possibility of success?
[00:58:38.619 --> 00:58:46.059]  Can we get either one of these lawsuits to discovery, in your view, based on the changing dynamic of the political environment today?
[00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:51.409]  Well, Mike, it's going to come down to the integrity of the courts.
[00:58:52.650 --> 00:59:00.650]  Unfortunately, we live in a world now where it depends on who you pick as a judge, whether or not you're going to be able to be heard.
[00:59:00.809 --> 00:59:06.510]  But I can tell you that the gravity of your case and the Bollinger case cannot be understated.
[00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:12.409]  The easily the most pervasive attack on free speech in history.
[00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:17.710]  Between the two, we can actually clean up all of the censorship industrial complex.
[00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:20.250]  We just need allies at this point.
[00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:30.349]  And what I would suggest with that is that to go to either thetruthaboutcancer.com Get the Bollinger complaint, which is brand new.
[00:59:31.210 --> 00:59:31.949]  Read it.
[00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:34.250]  It's 281 pages long.
[00:59:34.369 --> 00:59:37.730]  It is a surgical precision case.
[00:59:37.909 --> 00:59:39.130]  We tore it all apart.
[00:59:39.969 --> 00:59:41.829]  We went deep into this.
[00:59:42.119 --> 00:59:43.579]  And, of course, your case.
[00:59:43.719 --> 00:59:51.460]  But now both of them are available at socialmediafreedom.org, which is our site, under the Documents tab, and you can read them.
[00:59:51.639 --> 00:59:55.880]  But we explain how the entire industrial censorship complex was created.
[00:59:56.119 --> 01:00:02.079]  This conversation might get so much bigger and so much longer that I would invite people.
[01:00:03.059 --> 01:00:10.300]  Alex and myself and yourself and the Bollinger, we should have this longer discussion and talk about who's doing what here.
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:21.420]  Yeah, and we encourage Alex's organization or others that are watching, please take these lawsuits that we have filed, that the Bollinger's filed with your help.
[01:00:21.539 --> 01:00:25.010]  Take those lawsuits, So much research has been done.
[01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:30.570]  Use that as a template and apply it to you in your particular case.
[01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:37.570]  But we put this out in the public space on purpose because the smoking gun evidence is right there, isn't it, Jason?
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:41.280]  Yeah, we already laid it out for the government.
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:46.420]  We've laid it out for the DOJ. We've laid it out for everyone how it all can be fixed.
[01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:48.199]  We know how it can be fixed.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:52.920]  We just don't get the invitations to testify before Congress and so forth.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.320]  We can do this.
[01:00:54.619 --> 01:00:56.139]  We just need allies.
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:06.219]  That is our goal right now is to get the necessary powerful allies to fix the censorship problem because we will lose our country if we do not fix it.
[01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.050]  Well, here we have a story.
[01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:11.130]  Laura Logan just testified about censorship.
[01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:18.030]  She said, quote, this is a blood sport for them talking about the censors, the age of information warfare.
[01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:28.070]  And here we are at Infowars, actually winning the Infowar, thanks to people like Alex and all the great hosts here.
[01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:31.210]  Laura Logan nails it.
[01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:33.449]  And you're nailing it, Jason.
[01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:34.409]  We're nailing it.
[01:01:34.489 --> 01:01:49.210]  We are demonstrating right now what the First Amendment was written for, which is so that people can speak their mind, their truth, their opinions, their analysis, and add that to the public discourse.
[01:01:49.849 --> 01:01:53.309]  And Jason, we only have about a minute left in this segment.
[01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:54.329]  Any final thoughts?
[01:01:54.429 --> 01:01:55.789]  And give out your website one more time, please.
[01:01:56.630 --> 01:02:00.070]  Well, I also wanted to commend Lara Logan.
[01:02:01.469 --> 01:02:03.110]  We're working back and forth together.
[01:02:03.289 --> 01:02:06.070]  I actually talked with her last night.
[01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:11.610]  Socialmediafreedom.org, our goal is purely to restore freedoms online.
[01:02:11.769 --> 01:02:16.429]  It is to stop this tyranny, and without it, we are not going to be able to stop it.
[01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:18.110]  So this is a must.
[01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:19.530]  This is a must-do.
[01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:21.730]  We must gut the censorship industrial complex.
[01:02:21.969 --> 01:02:25.710]  We must restore the freedoms of speech online.
[01:02:27.019 --> 01:02:31.420]  One of the ways that you can follow, as you can see, is to find me on Twitter.
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:33.059]  I do still use it.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:39.800]  I'd love a conversation with Elon Musk about this situation because, of course, it's even in the crossfires.
[01:02:40.019 --> 01:02:41.480]  But thank you either way.
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:42.019]  Okay.
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:50.900]  Social Media Freedom Foundation there and Jason Fick, F-Y-K. Jason Fick is your tag on X. And thank you for joining us, Jason.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:51.739]  Thank you for all that you're doing.
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:55.260]  And we'll be right back after this break with the second hour straight ahead.
[01:02:55.489 --> 01:03:00.730]  All right, welcome back to the second hour of the Alex Jones show coming to you from Central Texas.
[01:03:00.929 --> 01:03:05.590]  I'm Mike Adams, the publisher of naturalnews.com, also a free speech independent media site.
[01:03:05.969 --> 01:03:15.449]  And all of us here in this space, we believe in decentralization of knowledge, decentralization of media, and also decentralization of finance.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.980]  And in fact, I just had a headline here about Truth Social.
[01:03:19.099 --> 01:03:24.320]  They wanna use a crypto-powered fintech solution to guard against debanking, right?
[01:03:24.539 --> 01:03:34.860]  Because why should we allow centrally controlled e-commerce solutions or banking and finance or lending services to be able to de-platform us because of our viewpoints?
[01:03:35.449 --> 01:03:52.949]  Well, one of the greatest champions in the whole realm of decentralization and advocating for peer-to-peer cryptocurrency usage and just teaching people, empowering people with this message that really is the empowerment of human civilization,
[01:03:52.989 --> 01:03:55.230]  in my view, is none other than Roger Ver.
[01:03:55.949 --> 01:04:09.030]  Roger Ver, known as Bitcoin Jesus, although he's not necessarily a huge fan of that name, but it kind of stuck because he's been so giving in his knowledge and also in the early days of a lot of Bitcoin.
[01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:10.690]  Hope those people held on to it.
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:24.699]  And he is, of course, facing extreme prosecution by the United States government because, I believe, because they wanna silence him because he's such an advocate for decentralization.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:34.840]  He is currently in Spain facing the risk of, well, an extradition order from the United States and potentially facing over 100 years in prison in the United States if he is convicted.
[01:04:35.429 --> 01:04:41.110]  And he joins us with a censored tag over his mouth at the moment.
[01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:43.250]  And beside him, Tracy Thurman.
[01:04:43.909 --> 01:04:46.769]  Tracy and Roger, it's an honor to have you both on the show today.
[01:04:46.969 --> 01:04:48.329]  Thank you for joining us from Spain.
[01:04:49.889 --> 01:04:50.670]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:04:50.829 --> 01:04:52.409]  We're very pleased to be able to join you.
[01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:56.610]  We're both huge fans of this show, and it's an honor to tell Roger's story here on InfoWars.
[01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:59.059]  Well, thank you both for taking the time.
[01:04:59.239 --> 01:05:03.159]  I know the time zones, you know, it's made it a little bit difficult.
[01:05:03.519 --> 01:05:08.820]  And I hope we can get Roger to say something here during this segment.
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.239]  But Tracy, let's start with you.
[01:05:11.099 --> 01:05:18.000]  Keep it in a summary format here because of just the compactness of today's broadcast here.
[01:05:18.139 --> 01:05:25.420]  But tell us the full story, to the extent you can, of what Roger Veer is facing and why they are trying to silence him.
[01:05:26.679 --> 01:05:27.019]  Sure.
[01:05:27.239 --> 01:05:29.460]  This story really goes back in a quarter century.
[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:32.739]  That's how long the lawfare against Roger has been going on.
[01:05:33.119 --> 01:05:40.059]  So 25 years ago, Roger ran for office as a young man in California, as a libertarian.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:48.599]  And in a debate there, when he was speaking with the Republican and the Democratic candidates, he was talking about what happened in Waco, Texas.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:55.219]  Because one of the things Rogers cares about most is human freedom and ending human suffering, especially the suffering of children.
[01:05:55.849 --> 01:05:59.849]  And he talked about how the ATF had murdered children in Waco, Texas.
[01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:00.510]  That's true.
[01:06:00.849 --> 01:06:01.449]  They did.
[01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:05.969]  He called them jackbooted child-murdering thugs, which is what they are.
[01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:07.710]  It's what they did in Waco.
[01:06:07.969 --> 01:06:10.489]  But the ATF decided that day to take offense.
[01:06:11.119 --> 01:06:13.639]  And to begin lawfare against Roger.
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:18.619]  And so they played the old Stalinist trick of show, you know, show me the man, I'll find you the crime.
[01:06:19.059 --> 01:06:22.280]  And what they found was that Roger had sold fireworks on eBay.
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.320]  And he was one of hundreds of people who had done this.
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:28.139]  He was buying them from Cabela's catalog and reselling them there as retail arbitrage.
[01:06:28.699 --> 01:06:30.159]  Nobody had a license to do this.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:31.860]  Cabela's didn't have a license to do it.
[01:06:32.119 --> 01:06:36.880]  But they picked one man and one man only to punish for not having a license for selling these fireworks, and that was Roger.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:43.159]  And so Roger ended up spending 10 months in federal prison because the ATF wanted him silent.
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.079]  And what year was this?
[01:06:45.239 --> 01:06:46.039]  What was that?
[01:06:46.159 --> 01:06:47.719]  What year did this take place?
[01:06:48.639 --> 01:06:58.019]  It started in 1999. His prison sentence was 2002 to 2003. Okay, but they didn't send anybody else to prison for the same behavior.
[01:06:59.539 --> 01:07:00.519]  Not one person.
[01:07:00.619 --> 01:07:03.860]  In fact, if you're wondering for a moment, are you sure this was lawfare?
[01:07:04.039 --> 01:07:16.579]  We know it was lawfare, because in a meeting between the ATF, the prosecutor, and Roger's attorney, Roger's attorney was making the case, look, this is normally something where you would give the guy maybe a fine, or you just tell him to go get a license, right?
[01:07:16.739 --> 01:07:17.980]  Everybody else, that's what you're doing.
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:23.739]  And the ATF agent pounded his fist on the table and said, you didn't hear what he said about us.
[01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:30.050]  Right, so because they did not like his speech, they selectively persecuted him.
[01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:34.530]  Now, we're all familiar with that here at InfoWars and myself as well.
[01:07:34.610 --> 01:07:36.730]  We've all been targeted because of our speech.
[01:07:36.909 --> 01:07:42.429]  But clearly, what you're describing now is long before the arrival of Bitcoin, right?
[01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:45.460]  Yes, no, this is long before the arrival of Bitcoin.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:51.340]  Who else were the victims of lawfare going back that far, other than perhaps Roger Ver and Alex Jones?
[01:07:51.659 --> 01:07:56.260]  This is something they have in common, is that they were both canaries in the coal mine of lawfare.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:56.619]  Yes.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.239]  These two men.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:04.500]  And so, by the time Roger got out, it was very clear to him the US government was not done with him.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.679]  The US government would probably never be done with him.
[01:08:08.019 --> 01:08:12.320]  And so he decided, tragically, that he had to leave the country in order to be safe.
[01:08:12.519 --> 01:08:13.500]  And so that's what he did.
[01:08:13.619 --> 01:08:21.199]  He left the US. And in the end, he had to give up his U.S. citizenship to get citizenship elsewhere because of the threat he felt from the U.S. government.
[01:08:21.319 --> 01:08:24.720]  That may have sounded insane to other people a decade ago.
[01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:29.359]  I think today most of your listeners will be nodding their heads and saying, I understand that now.
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:35.279]  I've watched so many of my heroes go down, go to prison, be silenced, be debanked.
[01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:37.289]  And Roger was one of the first.
[01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:38.050]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:08:38.069 --> 01:08:46.750]  Just to confirm that today, I mean, how many Americans are thinking, especially before the election, conservatives were thinking about, well, should I go to Panama?
[01:08:46.949 --> 01:08:47.630]  Should I go to Chile?
[01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:48.750]  Where should I go?
[01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:49.550]  Thailand?
[01:08:51.670 --> 01:09:06.989]  It's a lot of the Democrats, but they wanna flee because they committed crimes against the American people, such as censorship and malicious prosecution, which I think is this case here, also malicious prosecution.
[01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:24.000]  And I do wanna mention before you continue, Tracy, that I am personally advocating for President Trump To consider a pardon for Roger Ver, because a pardon of Roger Ver would send a very powerful message to the pro-freedom,
[01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:40.000]  pro-America, pro-crypto community that, Donald Trump, that you understand their plight, and you are not going to allow the Department of Justice of this government to be weaponized against advocates of decentralized finance.
[01:09:40.359 --> 01:09:41.819]  So that's my view.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.079]  Thank you so much for I don't think I can say with certainty that Roger's very grateful for that as well.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:47.800]  Well, please continue, Tracy.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:51.000]  We're grateful for everything that he has done over the years, but please continue.
[01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:57.239]  Yeah, so he left this country and then in 2011, he discovered Bitcoin.
[01:09:57.619 --> 01:10:03.239]  And if I know the story correctly, he was so intrigued by it, so excited by it.
[01:10:03.439 --> 01:10:09.140]  And he stayed up for days reading about it to the point of actually needing medical care due to being sleep deprived.
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:15.340]  But what he saw in Bitcoin was the opportunity for a permissionless free exchange between people.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:24.560]  Because if you've already been the target of the government, and again, at this point, many of your listeners have been, you know that the government has the ability to turn off your money.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:25.300]  That's right.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:26.840]  They do it all the time.
[01:10:26.859 --> 01:10:29.420]  And as long as the government has the ability to turn off your money, they have the ability to control you.
[01:10:29.869 --> 01:10:36.890]  Yep, and central bank digital currencies would only exacerbate that manipulation and threat against all of us.
[01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:43.770]  This is a primary theme here at Infowars, is alerting people to the dangers of CBDCs.
[01:10:43.989 --> 01:11:05.350]  And so it seems to me that one of the reasons why the US government, at least the pre-Trump government here, Wants to prosecute Roger is because, this is just my opinion, but I believe that Roger's education and empowerment of people would tend to help people realize the dangers of CBDCs.
[01:11:05.789 --> 01:11:08.189]  And so, do you agree with this assessment, Tracy?
[01:11:09.130 --> 01:11:10.270]  I do, I do.
[01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:13.449]  I think that that is a huge piece of why he's being targeted.
[01:11:13.789 --> 01:11:21.399]  Anyone who is building the ecosystem of freedom That allows us to have our own food, to have our own medical care, to make all these choices.
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:24.819]  But above all, to make our own choices about our finances.
[01:11:25.399 --> 01:11:29.300]  To be able to transact together, that is critical to absolutely every piece.
[01:11:29.439 --> 01:11:32.899]  And few people have done more to enable that than Roger has.
[01:11:33.239 --> 01:11:39.000]  And I do think that is a huge piece of why this last administration had it out for him.
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:39.859]  No, I understand.
[01:11:39.979 --> 01:11:44.380]  I'm sorry to interrupt, but there's a petition that people can sign, I believe.
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.380]  Is it freerogernow.org?
[01:11:46.439 --> 01:11:46.779]  Is that it?
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:49.779]  PreRogerNow.org.
[01:11:49.819 --> 01:11:51.760]  We encourage everybody, please go there.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:52.500]  Please sign it.
[01:11:52.579 --> 01:11:55.199]  It will take literally less than 15 seconds of your time.
[01:11:55.359 --> 01:11:57.899]  We don't ask you to put in all your personal information.
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:04.340]  But we need to be able to show President Trump and his incoming administration that there is support for this.
[01:12:04.479 --> 01:12:05.439]  There is support for Roger.
[01:12:05.619 --> 01:12:20.359]  And I can tell you, if you have ever put your money into any cryptocurrency, If you have ever benefited from the anti-lockdown movement, the medical freedom movement, from any of these things, even the anti-war movement, you've benefited from Roger's work.
[01:12:20.439 --> 01:12:21.399]  You just don't know about it.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:21.920]  Yeah, true.
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:27.600]  And so please give 15 seconds of your time to pay back to the man who has done so much for all of us.
[01:12:27.699 --> 01:12:30.399]  Okay, and that petition, I mean, that's not a commercial effort.
[01:12:30.939 --> 01:12:35.720]  People who signed that, they're not gonna get spammed with, hey, buy this meme coin or anything like that.
[01:12:35.819 --> 01:12:36.699]  It's not that at all.
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:37.800]  It's just- Nope.
[01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:42.250]  You might get the occasional email saying, hey, here's something new in our campaign.
[01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.970]  That would be it.
[01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:46.869]  We would never dream of doing anything like that with this list.
[01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:56.029]  This is solely for people who want to support Roger being free again and being able to return to the US. Absolutely.
[01:12:56.369 --> 01:12:57.609]  Why did he give up his citizenship?
[01:12:57.810 --> 01:13:02.770]  He gave up his citizenship because he was too afraid to be here anymore and no longer felt safe.
[01:13:03.109 --> 01:13:07.170]  And frankly, the conduct of our government since then has done nothing to dissuade him of that.
[01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:19.010]  He would love nothing more than to be a free man again, to be able to return to the US as a free man, welcomed back by us as Americans, and be able to see the people he loves again.
[01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:21.270]  He's been kept away from them for nearly a decade.
[01:13:21.449 --> 01:13:21.890]  It's horrible.
[01:13:22.069 --> 01:13:26.750]  Well, Roger's the kind of person who's a great innovator, the kind of person that makes this country great.
[01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:30.590]  And if you wanna make America great again, you need people like Roger here.
[01:13:30.689 --> 01:13:33.170]  Now, it's a little weird.
[01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:37.149]  Actually, having Roger sitting there, unable to speak.
[01:13:37.609 --> 01:13:45.229]  Roger, can you give me a thumbs up that if you come to the US, will you come here to the InfoWars studios and join us for an interview?
[01:13:46.329 --> 01:13:49.329]  Okay, we got a double thumbs up on that.
[01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:51.850]  All right, so thank you.
[01:13:52.109 --> 01:13:53.449]  Thank you for all you're doing, Roger.
[01:13:53.609 --> 01:14:02.229]  I know the reason you're not speaking, I would imagine, is on attorney's advice because of the persecution, the case that you're facing, and we understand that.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:06.920]  I just want you to know that all of us in America are rooting for you.
[01:14:07.079 --> 01:14:10.119]  And Tracy, you have been an incredible advocate.
[01:14:10.399 --> 01:14:15.439]  You flew to my studio and did an interview with me a couple of weeks ago.
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:16.340]  Thank you for doing that.
[01:14:16.659 --> 01:14:20.279]  You're obviously putting a lot of air miles in on this.
[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:26.600]  I just have to ask you, honestly, what is driving you to do this?
[01:14:26.819 --> 01:14:28.600]  This has taken your whole time.
[01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:30.069]  And passion.
[01:14:30.569 --> 01:14:32.170]  My entire life is on hold to get this done.
[01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.810]  You're right, Mike.
[01:14:34.109 --> 01:14:37.890]  I've spent years away from my own family against my will.
[01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:40.710]  I have my family back now.
[01:14:41.489 --> 01:14:44.369]  Roger has a right to have his loved ones back in his life too.
[01:14:44.529 --> 01:14:48.189]  And in order to do that, he has to be able to return to America as a free man.
[01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:53.039]  And so when I first Agreed to take on this case.
[01:14:53.199 --> 01:14:54.420]  I was ideologically aligned.
[01:14:54.579 --> 01:14:56.739]  I was very concerned about the legal precedent that's being set.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.220]  They're attempting to destroy attorney-client privilege here.
[01:14:59.359 --> 01:15:01.819]  They're attempting to destroy reliance on counsel defense.
[01:15:02.359 --> 01:15:06.960]  You can go look those up, but those are a really big deal for all Americans if those go down.
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:09.739]  So that's what I was initially motivated by.
[01:15:09.859 --> 01:15:13.329]  But I've worked with a lot of High net worth clients.
[01:15:13.529 --> 01:15:16.630]  And generally, they're very difficult people, to be totally honest with you.
[01:15:16.789 --> 01:15:19.449]  And I didn't expect to get along with Roger as a human being.
[01:15:19.609 --> 01:15:21.210]  But he's a really wonderful person.
[01:15:21.989 --> 01:15:22.909]  He's a kind person.
[01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:23.590]  He's compassionate.
[01:15:23.729 --> 01:15:26.050]  I've never seen him treat anyone with anything other than respect.
[01:15:27.069 --> 01:15:35.229]  And so I feel personally that he should have a right as a human being to return to his loved ones, his loved ones who are here in the United States.
[01:15:36.739 --> 01:15:39.659]  He should be able to return as an American to America.
[01:15:40.199 --> 01:15:40.579]  Yes.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:41.859]  And be reunited with them.
[01:15:42.159 --> 01:15:43.000]  And that's what motivates me.
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:45.760]  I know the pain of being separated from your loved ones.
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:49.479]  Also, Attorney Roger Barnes has also chimed in on this.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:51.479]  And I don't think we have that clip available.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:54.979]  But guys, if you could find that clip, we would like to play it.
[01:15:55.079 --> 01:15:56.819]  I think it's short, maybe a minute.
[01:15:57.479 --> 01:16:03.079]  But Barnes is correct in pointing out the legal importance of this.
[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:16.640]  Because as I understand it, Tracy, The federal government even raided the law offices of Rogers' attorney and confiscated private privileged communications.
[01:16:16.899 --> 01:16:19.579]  Attorney-client privilege has been thrown out the window.
[01:16:19.779 --> 01:16:30.579]  And that just speaks to the kind of lawfare that has been waged against Donald Trump, against Alex Jones, and so many of us in the pro-freedom, pro-liberty, pro-America space.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.000]  Am I correct?
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:34.680]  Is my understanding correct on what they did?
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:35.159]  Yes.
[01:16:35.399 --> 01:16:40.119]  No, the armed federal agents raided his attorney's office.
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:45.579]  And they timed it, by the way, to be done at the same time they were raiding Roger's office and his accountant's office.
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:50.199]  That way, Roger was essentially denied legal protection because he couldn't call his attorneys.
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:51.760]  They were a little busy at that moment.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:52.000]  Right.
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:54.159]  And they interrogated his attorneys.
[01:16:54.159 --> 01:16:57.100]  They took reams of documents they had absolutely no right to.
[01:16:57.590 --> 01:17:00.170]  And it's a horrifying precedent if this is allowed to stand.
[01:17:00.710 --> 01:17:07.270]  Imagine any one of you who's ever depended on an attorney, that your attorney could be forced to turn over data and be questioned about you.
[01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:15.210]  That your accountant, that you're no longer able to depend on your accountant to do your taxes and be able to say, look, I turned over all the information to them.
[01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:16.470]  I asked them to do it right.
[01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:17.710]  They're qualified.
[01:17:18.649 --> 01:17:23.369]  You know, it's called a reliance on counsel defense because without it, we're all screwed.
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:26.460]  The tax code is essentially 70,000 pages.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.319]  None of us can possibly memorize that.
[01:17:28.539 --> 01:17:35.300]  And so Roger hired some of the best attorneys in the world to help him understand that and to take care of it for him.
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:43.079]  And they're trying to use his case to take away that right for all of us in the same way they used Alex Jones to try to take away the rights of many Americans.
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:49.909]  And many people like you and me, Mike, we stood up and we said, look, if you don't stand up for Alex Jones, That's right.
[01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:51.170]  They're coming next.
[01:17:51.550 --> 01:17:54.989]  That's why I stood up for Alex Jones.
[01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:57.850]  I stood with Alex Jones during this entire time.
[01:17:58.689 --> 01:18:02.510]  And Alex has always stood for others as well.
[01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:09.279]  And by the way, Alex was absolutely thrilled when He learned that Roger was going to be joining us today.
[01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:14.479]  Even though you're not able to speak here right now, Roger, the fact that you are there, you gave us a thumbs up.
[01:18:14.819 --> 01:18:16.180]  Tracy, you're speaking for him.
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:17.100]  It's all understandable.
[01:18:17.659 --> 01:18:19.119]  Alex is thrilled that you're on the show.
[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:23.220]  Now, let's go to this clip from Robert Barnes speaking about this particular case.
[01:18:23.319 --> 01:18:23.859]  Go ahead and play that.
[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:27.039]  What's the latest on the guy who they're trying to extradite from Spain?
[01:18:27.199 --> 01:18:27.439]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18:27.579 --> 01:18:28.960]  So there's two big crypto cases.
[01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:31.939]  So one is crypto.com has brought suit against the Biden administration.
[01:18:32.359 --> 01:18:40.560]  And the other is the continued escalation of the extradition efforts against Roger Ver, colloquially known as Bitcoin Jesus.
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:44.479]  Leave it to the Biden administration to try to figure out a way to crucify Bitcoin Jesus.
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:50.579]  So for those that don't know who Roger Ver is, Roger Ver is one of the founders of the Bitcoin movement.
[01:18:50.739 --> 01:18:52.420]  It sort of was a Bitcoin purist.
[01:18:52.539 --> 01:19:02.300]  It was someone who believed in Bitcoin not for its self-enrichment prospects, but rather for its collective empowerment and individual freedom components.
[01:19:02.770 --> 01:19:19.930]  That if you really understood what Bitcoin was at core, there was the aspect I'm talking about, monetizing and incentivizing people to explore alternative ideas about the world that would let them go down Alice in Wonderland's rabbit hole, that allowed them to take the matrix red pill and see past the simulation.
[01:19:20.170 --> 01:19:23.270]  But the broader aspect of it was its capacity.
[01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:31.869]  To functionally revolutionize the world and remove financial control from central banks and central planners.
[01:19:32.029 --> 01:19:34.609]  Indeed, any central intermediary at all.
[01:19:34.810 --> 01:19:45.569]  Because it's based on democratizing, decentralizing currency and individually empowering through open source blockchain technology the means of exchange.
[01:19:47.010 --> 01:19:48.710]  Robert Barnes really gets it there.
[01:19:49.210 --> 01:19:52.369]  We're gonna end that, but Robert Barnes nails it.
[01:19:53.229 --> 01:19:54.430]  He's a super smart guy.
[01:19:54.529 --> 01:19:55.750]  He really understands this.
[01:19:56.210 --> 01:19:59.909]  And I wanna actually get into that with you a little bit, Tracy.
[01:20:00.090 --> 01:20:16.630]  Although, let me set the context that I believe Most people, almost everybody in the Bitcoin community supports freedom for Roger Ver, even if they may not agree with his interpretation of Bitcoin's choices along the way.
[01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:22.710]  Now, Roger is co-author of a very popular book now called Hijacking Bitcoin.
[01:20:23.529 --> 01:20:47.529]  And what Robert Barnes was just speaking to there speaks to the fact that the original vision, the Satoshi vision of Bitcoin, was that it would be held in self custody by individuals, it would be decentralized, and the block size would be large enough to handle enough volume to make transactions very low cost so that everyday people could use it in everyday trade,
[01:20:47.670 --> 01:20:47.770]  right?
[01:20:48.069 --> 01:20:54.359]  But unfortunately, some decisions were made in Bitcoin That limited the block size.
[01:20:54.619 --> 01:21:00.380]  And we have Aaron Day joining us coming up in a few minutes, who also speaks to this.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:13.500]  And Roger Ver came down on the side of the original Satoshi vision of Bitcoin, which was decentralized peer-to-peer transactions and not having Bitcoin largely controlled by centralized ETFs and that kind of thing.
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:17.199]  Tracy, is that something, do you want to speak to that at all?
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:19.560]  Go ahead.
[01:21:20.739 --> 01:21:27.880]  Yeah, I mean, it's absolutely true that there are people in the cryptocurrency community that disagree with Roger on the block size wars.
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:33.500]  But at this point, everyone needs to understand this is far beyond the block size wars.
[01:21:33.659 --> 01:21:37.340]  This is a precedent that will be used against everybody in the cryptocurrency space.
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:47.319]  And so there are many people in this space that may disagree with Roger on literally everything, who are absolutely committed to making sure this man does not go to prison for the rest of his life.
[01:21:47.479 --> 01:21:51.520]  Because they understand, it's like Donald Trump said, They're coming for the rest of you.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:52.520]  I'm just in the way.
[01:21:53.039 --> 01:21:53.579]  That's right.
[01:21:53.819 --> 01:21:55.920]  They're coming for everybody who is early crypto.
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:57.520]  They're coming for all the big crypto whales.
[01:21:58.279 --> 01:21:59.220]  Roger's just in the way.
[01:21:59.359 --> 01:22:00.840]  Take Roger down, set the precedent.
[01:22:01.039 --> 01:22:02.159]  They're coming for everyone else next.
[01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:03.739]  So this goes far beyond that.
[01:22:03.859 --> 01:22:10.939]  And I love what I think what Giancarlo said, where he said, if I have to choose between, I'm not gonna use his exact words.
[01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:17.300]  It was basically, if I have to choose between someone who's into altcoins and the government, I'll choose the altcoin guy, even though I disagree with him on everything else.
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:17.680]  100%.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:20.060]  And that's the answer we all need to take at this point.
[01:22:20.439 --> 01:22:22.699]  This is far beyond the block size.
[01:22:22.859 --> 01:22:28.699]  So we are asking, I'm asking for Donald Trump to consider a pardon for Roger Ver.
[01:22:29.449 --> 01:22:32.210]  And at the same time, Ross Ulbricht, right?
[01:22:32.869 --> 01:22:35.909]  Julian Assange, even consider Edward Snowden.
[01:22:36.109 --> 01:22:39.430]  Edward Snowden warned us and he told the truth.
[01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:47.250]  He blew the whistle on an illegal surveillance state and he was punished for that and nothing changed in America.
[01:22:47.710 --> 01:22:59.159]  And that, I'm sorry, Edward Snowden gave up his Professional life, his personal life, his family, his country, in order to try to warn us about how our government was being weaponized against us.
[01:22:59.319 --> 01:23:03.220]  And it strikes me that Roger's plight is in some ways similar.
[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:15.319]  Roger has had to give up his US citizenship in order to try to be free from the selective targeted persecution by a malicious government that has weaponized the truth against the American people.
[01:23:15.739 --> 01:23:19.239]  But Tracy and Roger, times are changing dramatically.
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:40.199]  The defeat of Kamala and the imminent defeat of elements of the deep state, this speaks very strongly to a new potential bright future for America, a future that can experience great abundance based on decentralized finance that Trump's people seem to understand.
[01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:41.060]  Your thoughts, Tracy?
[01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:43.079]  I agree.
[01:23:43.199 --> 01:23:50.979]  This is an incredibly exciting moment because November The morning of November 6th was a very happy morning for many of us.
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:24:01.359]  And not because I'm a deeply political person, but because I woke up that morning knowing that Ross Ulbricht, Roger Ver, potentially Julian Assange, all had a chance again.
[01:24:02.119 --> 01:24:03.380]  They all have a chance again.
[01:24:03.439 --> 01:24:03.779]  And why?
[01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:11.779]  They have a chance because so many of these people in this incoming administration, Trump especially, They understand what lawfare is.
[01:24:11.979 --> 01:24:13.720]  Trump, you understand lawfare.
[01:24:13.859 --> 01:24:14.100]  That's right.
[01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:15.579]  You've been the victor of it yourself.
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:17.760]  Alex Jones has been the victim of it.
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:19.539]  Elon Musk has been a victim of it.
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:23.680]  All of them have been, and all of them should be able to look at Roger and see a brother in arms.
[01:24:24.079 --> 01:24:31.079]  They should be able to see a man who has been going through the same thing they have at the hands of the same people who have been persecuting them.
[01:24:31.359 --> 01:24:36.859]  And a man who deserves the same freedom that they have today because Donald Trump won.
[01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:44.460]  So this is an opportunity for Donald Trump to change the world by saving one of the individuals who has revolutionized finance.
[01:24:45.090 --> 01:24:48.510]  And also, Trump has said he wants to make the U.S. the haven for cryptocurrency.
[01:24:49.010 --> 01:24:53.170]  I can tell you there's other countries that are literally rolling out the red carpet for these guys.
[01:24:53.369 --> 01:25:03.630]  You fly in on a private jet, they roll out a red carpet for you, they take you directly to a government building where they make sure by the end of the day you have your golden visa, you have everything you need.
[01:25:03.930 --> 01:25:06.390]  Meanwhile, the U.S. is putting these men in shackles.
[01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:13.239]  If you were one of these crypto billionaires, why on earth would you choose the U.S.? 100%, I'm sorry to cut you off, we're almost out of time.
[01:25:13.819 --> 01:25:16.420]  FreeRogerNow.org is the website, and I agree with you.
[01:25:16.539 --> 01:25:26.840]  If you wanna make America the crypto capital of the world, you start by pardoning Roger Ver and unleash him as an innovator for America.
[01:25:27.079 --> 01:25:30.239]  And that's how you make America great again, one of the many ways.
[01:25:30.479 --> 01:25:32.140]  So thank you both for joining me today.
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:34.180]  God bless you both, and be well.
[01:25:35.619 --> 01:25:36.899]  Thank you so much, Mike.
[01:25:37.079 --> 01:25:39.699]  And we can't wait till Roger can come back and speak for himself.
[01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:49.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, because of your support in the last 30 years, my operation has successfully devastated the globalists.
[01:25:49.390 --> 01:26:01.409]  The enemies of freedom worldwide openly give us the credit for being the genesis point for the mass global awakening to the new world order that is happening right now.
[01:26:01.770 --> 01:26:07.949]  So ladies and gentlemen, as we go into Christmas 2024, And the globalists are fighting as hard as they can to shut us down.
[01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:15.649]  I want to thank you for your past support and I want to encourage you now to support the broadcast while getting great products because we're winning.

[01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:25.130]  I know my most important work and my crew's most important work is still to come.
[01:26:25.329 --> 01:26:27.369]  The people of the planet are waking up.
[01:26:27.529 --> 01:26:29.550]  Now they're really ready to hear the truth.
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:31.819]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:26:32.199 --> 01:26:34.859]  I want you all to have a fabulous Christmas coming up.
[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:42.340]  And I want to encourage all of you to really think about what's happening around the world and ask yourselves, do we want to keep Alex Jones on the air?
[01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:47.180]  And do we want to get great products that enrich and empower our lives at the same time?
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:49.220]  Please go now.

[01:27:17.359 --> 01:27:24.399]  I want to thank you all for your past support.
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:30.720]  This victory you're seeing is because of you and you never backing down and never giving up.
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:34.479]  But now is the critical part of the fight and we need your support.
[01:27:34.659 --> 01:27:35.819]  Plus, these are great products.
[01:27:35.979 --> 01:27:39.359]  Please go to thealexjonesstore.com and keep us on the air.
[01:27:40.239 --> 01:27:41.119]  All right, welcome back.
[01:27:41.239 --> 01:27:43.420]  Mike Adams here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:50.659]  And we just heard from Tracy Thurman sitting beside Roger Veer, who gave us a thumbs up.
[01:27:50.819 --> 01:27:52.239]  He cannot speak at the moment.
[01:27:52.399 --> 01:27:53.199]  He's being persecuted.
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:28:00.229]  And I wonder why doesn't Why would Trump consider just telling the DOJ to drop the charges?
[01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:07.789]  I mean, a pardon is one thing, but why is Roger even being prosecuted?
[01:28:08.069 --> 01:28:09.670]  The charges make no sense.
[01:28:09.930 --> 01:28:11.989]  Their case is absurd.
[01:28:12.659 --> 01:28:15.779]  Any honest judge, I believe, would throw it out, even so.
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:20.479]  But they're dragging him through this process to try to make it as painful as possible.
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:28.060]  And that's exactly the wrong message for America, especially when Trump is coming in and wants to make America the crypto capital of the world.
[01:28:28.399 --> 01:28:31.859]  Well, step one, free Roger Ver.
[01:28:32.239 --> 01:28:47.020]  And actually, then invite Roger into helping the administration Innovate on crypto and innovate in a way that brings us e-commerce solutions using decentralized finance all across this country.
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:49.859]  And in fact, we're about to be joined by an expert in that area.
[01:28:50.359 --> 01:28:52.460]  Aaron Day will be joining us in just a second.
[01:28:53.039 --> 01:29:00.520]  First, let me mention thealexjonesstore.com is the sponsor for today's show, thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:29:00.699 --> 01:29:04.060]  And as you know, I've been teaching nutrition for 25 years.
[01:29:04.359 --> 01:29:06.020]  I'm known as the health ranger.
[01:29:07.609 --> 01:29:09.750]  I've been drinking this for 20 years, folks.
[01:29:10.029 --> 01:29:11.350]  This is avocados.
[01:29:11.689 --> 01:29:12.930]  This is turmeric.
[01:29:13.289 --> 01:29:17.109]  This is broccoli sprouts with sulforaphane, superfoods.
[01:29:17.109 --> 01:29:18.569]  I know it looks crazy, right?
[01:29:19.050 --> 01:29:21.949]  But this is what keeps me Be sharp.
[01:29:22.010 --> 01:29:24.590]  At my age, you have to turn to nutrition.
[01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:26.649]  I mean, I'm a speed cuber now.
[01:29:26.789 --> 01:29:28.909]  What did I do, a 42-second solve during the break?
[01:29:30.050 --> 01:29:34.729]  This is how, when you get older, folks, some of you listening, you're in your 30s.
[01:29:34.909 --> 01:29:36.970]  Get on to good nutrition now.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:44.479]  And you will be performing physically and cognitively into your 50s like I am and beyond.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.800]  Nutrition is the answer to do that.
[01:29:46.979 --> 01:29:53.680]  And the AlexJonesStore.com has put together some really amazing nutritional solutions that can help support you in that effort.
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:55.859]  Take my advice as the health ranger.
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:59.680]  Get started with nutrition and superfoods right now.
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:01.319]  Clean up your diets, folks.
[01:30:01.539 --> 01:30:03.159]  Clean up your intake.
[01:30:03.539 --> 01:30:04.880]  Get rid of the toxins.
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:06.960]  Boost your nutritional support.
[01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:09.199]  And you will be productive.
[01:30:10.119 --> 01:30:14.260]  I mean, you'll red pill yourself for decades to come.
[01:30:14.479 --> 01:30:17.539]  You need good nutrition to be able to see through all the lies.
[01:30:17.699 --> 01:30:23.479]  Seriously, if your brain is all foggy and dumbed down, then it's easier for the establishment to trick you.
[01:30:24.090 --> 01:30:28.229]  So nutrition actually is a way to set yourself free, seriously.
[01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:31.090]  So thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:30:31.909 --> 01:30:36.710]  Now, speaking of freedom, our guest here, Aaron Day, is a strong advocate of freedom.
[01:30:36.909 --> 01:30:46.970]  He's an advocate also of privacy coins, which is something I'm a fan of as well, because I don't want everybody to know where I've sent coins or where I receive them or whatever.
[01:30:47.130 --> 01:30:48.430]  It's not their business, right?
[01:30:48.710 --> 01:30:49.789]  Privacy is a basic human right.
[01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:51.210]  Aaron Day joins us.
[01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:53.010]  Welcome, Mr. Day, to the program.
[01:30:53.010 --> 01:30:54.189]  It's an honor to have you on, sir.
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:55.859]  Thank you for having me.
[01:30:55.939 --> 01:30:56.520]  Good to see you again.
[01:30:56.819 --> 01:30:57.979]  It's good to see you, Aaron.
[01:30:58.220 --> 01:30:59.539]  I really want to thank you for joining us today.
[01:30:59.659 --> 01:31:03.420]  You've been a guest on my show, Decentralized TV, I think twice now.
[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:08.119]  And you probably just saw our interview with Tracy with Roger sitting there.
[01:31:08.479 --> 01:31:12.880]  What's your reaction to the prosecution of Roger Veer?
[01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:18.710]  I mean, my reaction is that it's very clearly politically motivated.
[01:31:18.970 --> 01:31:20.569]  I mean, I've been following it very closely.
[01:31:20.789 --> 01:31:27.430]  My primary issue is trying to warn people about the threats of CBDCs and to explore alternative currencies.
[01:31:27.829 --> 01:31:42.750]  And I think that Roger's being targeted specifically because he's probably the most effective advocate on the planet for using alternative currencies as a way to not get stuck with central bank digital currency tyranny.
[01:31:43.899 --> 01:31:53.720]  Now, Aaron, how critical is it for America's position as a crypto leader for people like Roger to be embraced rather than prosecuted?
[01:31:55.409 --> 01:31:57.130]  Well, I mean, it's absolutely critical.
[01:31:57.630 --> 01:32:05.210]  I mean, cryptocurrencies are obviously here to stay, and fiat currencies all over the world are collapsing.
[01:32:05.449 --> 01:32:09.590]  And in fact, state-issued currencies have a 0% success rate.
[01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:13.510]  Most government-backed currencies fail after only 27 years.
[01:32:13.630 --> 01:32:19.810]  And so we're now seeing this whole geopolitical battle between the United States and BRICS and everything else.
[01:32:19.890 --> 01:32:23.350]  And so cryptocurrencies really are the future and the way out.
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:33.699]  Okay, so give our audience a little bit of background of what brought you to this point, and what it is you do exactly with your foundation.
[01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:47.979]  Sure, so I started entrepreneur, and my second company was actually destroyed inadvertently by the federal government, by Dodd-Frank, Obamacare, and Eric Holder.
[01:32:48.199 --> 01:32:53.750]  And I won't go into all the details on that, but that turned me into a I'm a full-time liberty activist.
[01:32:54.029 --> 01:32:57.010]  And so I moved to New Hampshire as part of the Free State Project.
[01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:58.850]  That's where I learned about cryptocurrency.
[01:32:58.850 --> 01:33:07.390]  I actually learned about Bitcoin from Roger at a Free State Project event in 2012. I spent a lot of time on political activism.
[01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:20.550]  My wife and I helped get candidates elected at the state level and tried to go the political route and then kind of threw up my hands at that around 2018 and stopped using a bank account personally.
[01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:26.909]  And started urging others to opt out of using fiat currency.
[01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:34.569]  Then COVID hit, and all of a sudden I noticed that my friends were being targeted by the federal government.
[01:33:35.029 --> 01:33:47.250]  Ian Freeman, who I learned about the Free State Project from, Is now in federal prison for eight years for selling Bitcoin without filling out the appropriate paperwork, which was clearly a manufactured case.
[01:33:47.890 --> 01:33:52.710]  Jeremy Kaufman started a company called Library, which is a decentralized version of YouTube.
[01:33:52.949 --> 01:33:57.609]  He was targeted by the SEC and they destroyed his business after five years.
[01:33:57.750 --> 01:34:00.189]  So I wanted to look at, well, what is the cause of this?
[01:34:00.329 --> 01:34:07.510]  Why is it specifically that people at the intersection of Liberty and crypto are being targeted and destroyed?
[01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:09.090]  By the federal government.
[01:34:09.289 --> 01:34:28.529]  And what I found was that, and particularly under Biden, in his executive order 14067, it is currently government policy for the United States to both explore a central bank digital currency, as well as to take a whole of government approach to regulating decentralized cryptocurrency.
[01:34:28.529 --> 01:34:30.369]  And that's exactly what they've been doing.
[01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:40.619]  It's the SEC, the Treasury, the FBI, the IRS. Every branch of the federal government has been mobilized to go after people in the crypto space.
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:45.119]  And so this is why people like Roger and others have been targeted.
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:47.159]  Many others have been thrown in prison.
[01:34:48.060 --> 01:35:00.439]  As Marc Andreessen eloquently explained on Joe Rogan a week or so ago, people are being debanked all over the place with a particular emphasis on anybody in the cryptocurrency space.
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:06.579]  And so this crackdown is real, but so is the emergence of CBDCs.
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:16.039]  We went from a situation where in 2020, There were 35 countries just researching CBDCs and really only China was experimenting with it.
[01:35:16.539 --> 01:35:18.119]  Fast forward four years.
[01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:29.340]  Today, 134 countries representing 98% of the global GDP are exploring CBDCs and over half of those are actually beyond the research phase.
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:37.819]  11 countries have already rolled out a CBDC. And there are more CBDC accounts globally than decentralized cryptocurrency accounts.
[01:35:38.079 --> 01:35:49.979]  And so the whole process of using the state and throwing people in prison and targeting Liberty crypto activists is to close off competitions so that when they roll out the CBDC, people have no choice.
[01:35:50.159 --> 01:35:51.640]  Well, it's very clear, Aaron.
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:58.220]  And by the way, please look right at the camera as you're speaking with us and give us your website for your foundation too, please.
[01:35:58.359 --> 01:35:58.899]  What is that?
[01:35:59.619 --> 01:36:02.760]  My website is daylightfreedom.org.
[01:36:02.899 --> 01:36:04.399]  Okay, daylightfreedom.org.
[01:36:04.739 --> 01:36:07.380]  Let me ask your reaction to this news headline here.
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:15.720]  Following Kuwait, Vietnam to debank people who do not get their biometrics scanned for a digital ID app.
[01:36:16.199 --> 01:36:25.279]  So there it is, Vietnam, communist country, and the communists love CBDCs, don't they?
[01:36:26.659 --> 01:36:31.279]  Well, the communists love CBDCs, but actually, it's not limited to just communist countries.
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:48.329]  The United States is actually fairly advanced in the development of our own CBDC, which is something that we've been working on since 2019. In fact, when I started researching this, I saw all this information about countries Rapidly developing CBDCs.
[01:36:48.409 --> 01:37:04.329]  But when I explored how our monetary system works today, I realized we really already have effectively a CBDC. When you talk to people about what they're concerned about with central bank digital currencies, they're concerned about having their financial transactions monitored.
[01:37:04.630 --> 01:37:08.270]  They're concerned about being censored and debanked.
[01:37:08.369 --> 01:37:10.689]  And they're concerned about money being programmable.
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:15.159]  All three of those things are true with our system today.
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:18.159]  92% of our system is digital.
[01:37:18.399 --> 01:37:19.840]  There's only 8% cash.
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:29.579]  The way money is created is the federal government goes to the Federal Reserve and issues an IOU. And then the Federal Reserve creates the money out of thin air in a database.
[01:37:29.859 --> 01:37:34.239]  I mean, that is very much by definition a central bank digital currency.
[01:37:34.399 --> 01:37:34.539]  Yes.
[01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:37.340]  Our system is already programmable.
[01:37:37.579 --> 01:37:51.539]  So anybody that has a health savings account or a flexible spending account, this is essentially a relationship with a bank where you can only buy specific health-related goods and services from specific retailers at specific times.
[01:37:52.159 --> 01:38:15.659]  MasterCard actually did a pilot program with the United Nations We're good to go.
[01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:23.069]  Well, let me ask you about the Trump administration and where this needs to go because I think you and I probably have a very similar conclusion on this.
[01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:29.489]  Personally, I don't want to play the FOMO speculation game with Bitcoin or any coin.
[01:38:29.649 --> 01:38:39.279]  I want a relatively stable coin That doesn't have a lot of price risk, but that is widely usable in everyday transactions.
[01:38:39.279 --> 01:38:43.279]  I wanna be able to go to the grocery store and pay with a privacy coin.
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:43.819]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:50.399]  I wanna be able to go to a farmer's market and purchase with a privacy coin that the government doesn't even know about.
[01:38:50.479 --> 01:38:53.119]  Or maybe it's Bitcoin with a privacy layer or something.
[01:38:54.630 --> 01:39:06.850]  I hear a lot of people, especially those who are kind of newbies and don't really understand the block size wars, they just want Bitcoin to go up and up and up in price forever, but it's centrally controlled, it's an ETF, you don't have self custody.
[01:39:07.329 --> 01:39:09.529]  That's not what this is about, right?
[01:39:09.789 --> 01:39:11.930]  We need something usable.
[01:39:12.789 --> 01:39:14.409]  Do you agree with me on that point?
[01:39:15.239 --> 01:39:17.600]  Well, I agree with you on that point completely.
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:21.800]  And when I first heard Roger talk about Bitcoin in 2012, this was the original vision.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.760]  And when I started using Bitcoin, that was the use case.
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:27.479]  I actually would use it in New Hampshire.
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:40.510]  There were many restaurants and retail stores that would actually accept Bitcoin And by 2017, major retailers like Microsoft and Overstock and Expedia were accepting Bitcoin directly.
[01:39:40.689 --> 01:39:42.010]  So this was the original vision.
[01:39:42.170 --> 01:39:48.510]  But without going into all the details about any block size war, clearly Bitcoin has morphed into digital gold.
[01:39:48.630 --> 01:39:53.449]  And so whether people like the idea that it's digital gold or not really is immaterial.
[01:39:53.449 --> 01:39:56.149]  We still need peer-to-peer digital cash.
[01:39:56.289 --> 01:39:58.569]  So if you want Bitcoin as digital gold, that's great.
[01:39:59.530 --> 01:40:10.569]  There are some issues with that, but we still need to have the ability to do day-to-day commerce outside of the control system of the federal government and outside of the control system of the central banks.
[01:40:10.710 --> 01:40:13.949]  And privacy coins offer the opportunity to do just that.
[01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:20.750]  Well, and I'm thinking, I mean, even here at Infowars, the sponsor of the show today, thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:40:20.930 --> 01:40:31.770]  Now, if I were Alex Jones, I would be thinking, hey, I want that store to be able to accept payment in crypto, especially privacy crypto, because that does two things for me as a merchant.
[01:40:32.050 --> 01:40:36.229]  Number one, then my e-commerce provider can't cut me off because of viewpoint discrimination.
[01:40:36.850 --> 01:40:43.130]  Secondly, nobody can surveil the list of customers or trace who is buying products from my store, right?
[01:40:43.329 --> 01:40:47.930]  Because if I'm Alex Jones, I want to also protect the privacy of the customers that are purchasing from me.
[01:40:48.329 --> 01:40:52.210]  So this is something that's been needed, I think, for a very long time.
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:41:01.180]  I gotta say, I saw you put out something, a little hint on Twitter the other day that you're thinking about some kind of project.
[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:02.279]  I don't know, a teaser.
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:04.000]  I see you have a logo on your screen there.
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:06.520]  Karma, I think, is how you pronounce it.
[01:41:07.739 --> 01:41:11.960]  I just want to say to the audience, I'm not endorsing this project at this point.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.939]  I don't really know anything about it, but you want to give us a little teaser of what you're working on?
[01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:16.760]  I think it's relevant.
[01:41:17.609 --> 01:41:22.130]  Sure, so my wife and I have been doing these four-hour workshops all over the country.
[01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:30.310]  And we've been showing people how to use alternative currencies, how to use cryptocurrency, gold and silver for day-to-day transactions.
[01:41:30.710 --> 01:41:36.149]  And one of the things that I found talking to merchants is they are concerned about cryptocurrency.
[01:41:36.449 --> 01:41:37.930]  They know the dollar is losing value.
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:46.220]  The dollar's lost somewhere between 25% and 40% of its purchasing power just since 2020. So everybody knows this.
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:47.600]  Small businesses know this.
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:50.960]  The problem is cryptocurrency prices are too volatile.
[01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:56.359]  And merchants don't know how they're going to be able to spend those on a day-to-day basis.
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:04.310]  And so one idea that I'm looking to roll out next year is the idea of a gold-backed Privacy stable coin.
[01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:18.289]  So what that means is we're combining all of the elements that people love about gold in terms of its stable price and uses money for 5,000 years, but with the best aspects of cryptocurrency.
[01:42:18.289 --> 01:42:31.569]  So the ability to have private transactions, the ability to have low transaction fees, and the ability for the merchant to, or the consumer for that matter, to be able to redeem these tokens for physical gold.
[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:43.220]  So, you know, as the dollar was at one point until France came to Nixon and said, hey, we'd like to load up our ships.
[01:42:43.439 --> 01:42:45.600]  And our Treasury Secretary said, well, that's your problem.
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:47.039]  And then we abandoned the gold standard.
[01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:51.699]  The idea is, what if we had a gold-backed currency that was separate from government?
[01:42:52.199 --> 01:42:58.880]  With vaults across the world in different countries where people could actually redeem these tokens for physical gold.
[01:42:58.979 --> 01:43:00.220]  Well, I love the idea.
[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:04.079]  I think the Federal Reserve will hate the idea, obviously, because they want centralized control.
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:11.020]  But it's interesting to me that these currency wars, I mean, think about BRICS, right?
[01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:16.420]  So BRICS is rumored to be 40% backed by physical gold.
[01:43:17.159 --> 01:43:23.560]  And the other 60% of basket of currencies of participating nations where they do have a distributed but permissioned blockchain.
[01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:37.760]  So not everybody can just chime in with proof of work overrides, but it's still distributed among the countries to do an international settlement token system called the unit, I believe, that is backed 40% by gold.
[01:43:37.939 --> 01:43:45.369]  So what you're saying here with your idea is actually Kind of similar to what BRICS is talking about.
[01:43:45.810 --> 01:43:54.789]  How does China and Russia, if they trade with each other, how do they establish trust, given that historically China and Russia do not trust each other?
[01:43:55.069 --> 01:43:59.590]  And I think they establish trust through this consensus system backed by vaulted gold.
[01:43:59.869 --> 01:44:01.310]  Does that sound right?
[01:44:02.250 --> 01:44:03.710]  I mean, that's one way to do it.
[01:44:03.789 --> 01:44:09.390]  Here's the problem that I have, and this is why I think that we need a decentralized solution separate from state.
[01:44:10.109 --> 01:44:15.350]  It's not as though governments haven't had currencies that are backed by precious metals in the past.
[01:44:15.489 --> 01:44:16.890]  This has happened time and time again.
[01:44:17.329 --> 01:44:24.170]  Martin Armstrong has done a lot of analysis where he would actually collect coins and actually show and document the debasement of the coins.
[01:44:24.489 --> 01:44:30.550]  By the end of the Roman Empire, the silver denarius only had 0.05% silver in it.
[01:44:30.670 --> 01:44:37.250]  And so the thing is, bricks or whoever can say, is there really gold in the vault, first of all?
[01:44:37.630 --> 01:44:39.430]  Which that seems to be an issue.
[01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:42.210]  Do we even have gold in Fort Knox currently?
[01:44:42.489 --> 01:44:49.210]  I mean, we seem to not be passing audits even to this day fully with respect to the United States' own gold supply.
[01:44:49.409 --> 01:44:54.869]  But then it's also possible to issue tokens that are disconnected from the gold supply itself.
[01:44:55.050 --> 01:45:00.210]  So in other words, we could just have digital IOUs backed by theoretical gold.
[01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:02.710]  And so this is the issue that I have.
[01:45:02.789 --> 01:45:13.090]  The issue that I have is in studying currency, the problem It doesn't seem to be whether it's silver or gold or whether it's fiat currency where it's just printed out of thin air backed by IOUs.
[01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:21.369]  The common source of the problem with money is state issuance of the money and the fact that the issuance of the money is tied to government spending.
[01:45:21.369 --> 01:45:24.029]  That literally has never worked as a model.
[01:45:24.409 --> 01:45:25.909]  Right, yeah, exactly.
[01:45:26.109 --> 01:45:31.750]  And that's why Trump needs to understand that this is not just about pumping up the price of Bitcoin.
[01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:34.710]  That's not the utility that America needs.
[01:45:34.909 --> 01:45:41.369]  We need a decentralized financial system in order to succeed economically as a nation.
[01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:51.050]  By the way, I hope you don't mind my comedy here, but the chroma glow around your head looks like the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi in The Empire Strikes Back.
[01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:53.390]  So thank you for bringing that in.
[01:45:53.449 --> 01:45:53.770]  It's great.
[01:45:53.850 --> 01:45:54.909]  That's a positive image.
[01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:57.029]  You're like Obi-Wan Kenobi here today.
[01:45:57.829 --> 01:46:02.270]  I wasn't shooting for it, but if it works, it works.
[01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.789]  It works!
[01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:07.119]  Hey, well, we had Bitcoin Jesus earlier, and now we have Obi-Wan Kenobi of crypto.
[01:46:07.859 --> 01:46:10.619]  So thank you for joining us with all of that.
[01:46:11.079 --> 01:46:26.500]  Aaron, I completely agree with what you're saying, but I fear that even with Trump coming into the administration, there's going to be so much power and control demanded by the central banks, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury.
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.319]  Nobody wants to give up power, and they can weaponize their system.
[01:46:33.690 --> 01:46:48.670]  How on earth do you perceive that the American people could decentralize finance and effectively defeat the con of the Fed that G. Edward Griffin has warned us about for decades, and Ron Paul for that matter?
[01:46:50.119 --> 01:46:53.319]  Well, so I mean, I always say vote with your feet and ditch the dollar.
[01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:56.479]  This has actually been my theme for a couple of years now.
[01:46:56.659 --> 01:47:02.300]  I mean, I've been living outside of the banking system since 2019. So it is possible.
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:07.100]  It just requires people to be willing to stand up and try alternatives.
[01:47:08.129 --> 01:47:23.729]  The crypto that I'm talking about, this Karma privacy coin is built using a blockchain called Zano, Z-A-N-O, which is an incredible technology that has really been 10 years in the making with proven cryptography behind it.
[01:47:23.829 --> 01:47:28.170]  And so the way to be successful at this is to out-innovate.
[01:47:28.489 --> 01:47:31.210]  And we know what we're facing with these central banks.
[01:47:31.369 --> 01:47:47.590]  The whole point of what's going on with CBDCs is a movement towards a single global digital currency and a complete surveillance state where inevitably all of our transactions are monitored and our behavior is tied to a social credit score.
[01:47:47.729 --> 01:47:54.109]  And whether or not we have access to money relates to whether or not we comply with the government mandates.
[01:47:54.409 --> 01:47:57.289]  And so the way you defeat surveillance is with privacy.
[01:47:57.670 --> 01:48:07.670]  Which is why I think projects like Zeno, Monero, and the stablecoin that I'm working on are ways out, legitimate ways out where people can opt out of the system.
[01:48:07.869 --> 01:48:11.189]  Well, I'm a big fan of Monero, just to be clear.
[01:48:11.810 --> 01:48:20.270]  If I have a choice, I always prefer to use Monero over Bitcoin for real-world transactions because I don't want to leave a trail of what I did with that money.
[01:48:20.710 --> 01:48:27.470]  Like recently, I donated crypto to the congressional campaign of Dennis Kucinich, by the way.
[01:48:27.659 --> 01:48:29.859]  Former Democrat ran as an independent.
[01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:31.840]  He has an anti-war stance, right?
[01:48:32.239 --> 01:48:35.479]  And we complied with FEC rules.
[01:48:35.479 --> 01:48:44.819]  I filled out my name and everything as required, and I donated the maximum allowable under law, which I think was $3,300 worth of crypto.
[01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:49.239]  But I would rather use crypto for that kind of thing than the banking system.
[01:48:49.319 --> 01:48:50.859]  The banking system could always say no.
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:54.340]  Why should I have to go ask for permission from my bank?
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:49:00.039]  Or if I'm wiring money to buy gold, I don't want my bank asking me questions like, what's it for?
[01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:00.640]  What's it for?
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:01.739]  I'll tell you what it's for.
[01:49:01.899 --> 01:49:04.100]  It's for none of your damn business is what it's for.
[01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:05.159]  It's my money.
[01:49:05.359 --> 01:49:06.859]  Send out the wire, right?
[01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:09.000]  But with crypto, we don't have that problem, do we?
[01:49:09.579 --> 01:49:10.619]  We don't have that problem.
[01:49:11.210 --> 01:49:19.289]  We don't have that problem, but also we used to have an assumption of privacy by default, even with our current banking system and with the dollar, and that has disappeared.
[01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:25.279]  There are now 13 different federal programs that are involved in tracking our financial behavior.
[01:49:25.659 --> 01:49:28.039]  The NSA is doing bulk data collection.
[01:49:28.279 --> 01:49:32.640]  The IRS is now using AI working with banks to analyze all of our transactions.
[01:49:33.119 --> 01:49:44.899]  Through the Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act, they can come in and seize your bank account and then issue something called a national security letter where you can't talk to anybody about it, including your own lawyer.
[01:49:45.159 --> 01:49:51.090]  So this isn't a future CBDC. This is the current state of surveillance of our current system.
[01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:54.489]  So the Fourth Amendment is completely out, has been thrown out the window.
[01:49:54.489 --> 01:50:00.529]  And so we just need to take our privacy back and reassert privacy as a fundamental right.
[01:50:00.979 --> 01:50:04.680]  Well, it seems to me like the Roger Ver case is really the litmus test for the Trump administration.
[01:50:05.359 --> 01:50:15.260]  If they free Roger Ver, that's sort of an indicator that Trump is gonna be pro crypto and support innovation for the whole crypto space, right?
[01:50:15.739 --> 01:50:22.359]  If Roger Ver gets prosecuted, then it seems like that's a sign to all of us that they're gonna come after us next.
[01:50:22.739 --> 01:50:23.659]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:25.430]  Well, it is a big deal.
[01:50:25.529 --> 01:50:26.949]  But I live in New Hampshire.
[01:50:26.949 --> 01:50:30.909]  And so I was here when Trump came out against CBDCs.
[01:50:31.050 --> 01:50:34.510]  And so Trump has made a statement that he is against CBDCs.
[01:50:34.590 --> 01:50:39.909]  And so I think it's really important for Trump to understand that it's Biden's executive order.
[01:50:40.159 --> 01:50:49.760]  Which is probably why they accelerated and decided to ultimately go after Roger at the last minute because Roger is a threat to CBDCs.
[01:50:49.859 --> 01:51:00.020]  So if anything, Trump should be talking to Roger because if Trump wants to fulfill his campaign promise to stop CBDCs, there is no one on the planet that knows more about this topic than Roger Ver.
[01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:08.960]  Well, and if Trump does decide to either pardon him or tell the DOJ to just drop the charges, it's ridiculous.
[01:51:09.659 --> 01:51:20.479]  That would generate so much goodwill, even across independent media, many of us who have been critical of Trump's position on vaccines, for example.
[01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:23.460]  But the goodwill that would engender would be tremendous.
[01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:25.779]  Aaron Day, we're out of time.
[01:51:25.899 --> 01:51:27.060]  Give us your website one more time, please.
[01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:29.739]  Daylightfreedom.org.
[01:51:29.939 --> 01:51:31.659]  Okay, daylightfreedom.org.
[01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:33.720]  And Aaron, keep us posted.
[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:36.199]  Thank you so much for all that you do.
[01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:39.880]  I've enjoyed getting to know you, and I really appreciate your philosophy.
[01:51:40.819 --> 01:51:41.260]  Godspeed.
[01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:41.720]  Take care.
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:42.760]  Thank you.
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:43.460]  Thanks for having me.
[01:51:43.659 --> 01:51:43.920]  All right.
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:44.760]  And thank you all.
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:47.159]  Mike Adams here with the Alex Jones Show.
[01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:50.439]  And there's more shows straight ahead, the third hour.
[01:51:50.779 --> 01:51:51.279]  Stay with us.
[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:54.939]  Christmas ornaments, drywall, and Jerry Epstein.
[01:51:55.810 --> 01:51:58.090]  Name three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:51:59.369 --> 01:52:01.630]  There are three things that don't hang themselves.
[01:52:02.050 --> 01:52:05.229]  Drywall, Christmas tree lights, and Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:52:05.590 --> 01:52:08.250]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in free fall.
[01:52:08.369 --> 01:52:10.229]  Their entire criminal operation is collapsing.
[01:52:10.670 --> 01:52:16.710]  Trump is officially going after the Biden administration for the criminal human trafficking and sex slavery.
[01:52:17.149 --> 01:52:19.989]  We're going to take control January 20th, and people are going to be held accountable.
[01:52:20.310 --> 01:52:21.409]  We're going to be very transparent.
[01:52:21.649 --> 01:52:22.529]  We're going to get behind.
[01:52:22.710 --> 01:52:25.949]  What did the United Nations have to do with the open border crisis?
[01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:27.710]  What NGOs were involved in this?
[01:52:27.850 --> 01:52:31.970]  We're going to be very transparent American people and we're going to tell them the truth what happened on this border.
[01:52:32.130 --> 01:52:33.409]  Again, by design.
[01:52:33.630 --> 01:52:35.109]  And so much more is happening.
[01:52:35.250 --> 01:52:36.130]  This is an exciting time.
[01:52:36.350 --> 01:52:38.329]  But the globalists are striking back.
[01:52:38.489 --> 01:52:42.409]  That's why it's important to keep our operation on air now more than ever.
[01:52:42.529 --> 01:52:44.409]  And we can't do it without you.
[01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:45.390]  So we make it easy.
[01:52:45.529 --> 01:52:55.449]  Go to thealexshonestore.com and get the most amazing, widest selection of patriot apparel anywhere to spread the word, to meet like-minded people and support the InfoWard.
[01:52:55.569 --> 01:53:04.939]  Now, The folks at Bigly that power the alexjonesstore.com have come out with some amazing limited edition Christmas hoodies and sweaters.
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:06.579]  And I personally love this one.
[01:53:06.819 --> 01:53:10.260]  I'm not usually into wearing a shirt with myself on it, but this one's really cool.
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:12.739]  And the family and friends will have so much fun.
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:14.039]  It's a great conversation piece.
[01:53:14.399 --> 01:53:15.979]  And this will horrify.
[01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:21.600]  Leftists, and then maybe you can be friendly to them once they are up against the wall, shaking and framing, walking on the street, saying, it's okay.
[01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:26.699]  Alex Jones doesn't bite, though it kind of does look like I'm Jaws coming up on the swimmer there.
[01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:33.300]  There's so many other great limited edition shirts, hoodies, sweaters right now.
[01:53:33.539 --> 01:53:36.800]  And then, of course, there's the Darth Sidious of hoodies.

[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:01.340]  They're like, but have you looked at the CMOS? We've got one of the top suppliers that'll let us private label it.
[01:55:01.439 --> 01:55:05.579]  And I looked at it, and I was like, oh my God, this is the superfood other than maybe hemp.
[01:55:06.189 --> 01:55:07.590]  But it does other effects than him.

[01:55:33.579 --> 01:55:35.859]  Pretty dangerous for me and Trump, but we wouldn't be anywhere else.
[01:55:36.039 --> 01:55:38.300]  Thanks for keeping me and President Trump in the fight.
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:39.579]  God bless and good luck.
[01:55:40.119 --> 01:55:41.220]  Oh, and I almost forgot.
[01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:44.119]  Merry, Merry Christmas to everybody.
[01:55:44.300 --> 01:55:47.180]  That's so triggering to the left, but I also love Christmas.
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:50.800]  And a Happy New Year with President Trump about to come into office.
[01:56:04.479 --> 01:56:08.100]  Welcome to the new world order.
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:11.560]  Okay, my concern about 5G is that...
[01:56:12.379 --> 01:56:15.180]  The RF radiation from 5G is dangerous.
[01:56:15.619 --> 01:56:19.000]  It disrupts the blood-brain barrier.
[01:56:19.239 --> 01:56:23.460]  It also is associated with glioblastomas and other cancers.
[01:56:24.279 --> 01:56:26.859]  And it causes a lot of other dramatic health effects.
[01:56:27.020 --> 01:56:29.659]  And there are literally thousands and thousands of studies in that.
[01:56:29.779 --> 01:56:33.840]  I've litigated on that issue, and I've won in the Federal Court of Appeals.
[01:56:33.979 --> 01:56:40.399]  So, you know, you can say it's a conspiracy theory, but the Federal Court of Appeals Said it before, I'm gonna say it again.
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:44.819]  These 5G towers, they're not for internet and phone service.
[01:56:44.979 --> 01:56:47.060]  That's all a scam and a lie and a cover story.
[01:56:47.199 --> 01:56:48.819]  For the Project Bluebeam technology.
[01:56:48.819 --> 01:56:52.159]  For the microwave weapon that it was designed to be.
[01:56:52.479 --> 01:56:56.560]  To zap you with frequencies and mess with your sleep and your health.
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:56:58.239]  This is not conspiracy theory.
[01:56:58.399 --> 01:57:05.600]  And by the way, those of you that want to throw out the word conspiracy theory, that immediately tells me how ignorant and asleep you are.
[01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:08.710]  You don't even know what that term, where it came from or why they use it.
[01:57:08.789 --> 01:57:12.130]  It's simply to discredit whistleblowers, people telling the truth.
[01:57:12.329 --> 01:57:16.229]  So when you throw that term around, you just show that you're asleep and a sheep.
[01:57:16.430 --> 01:57:16.829]  That's it.
[01:57:16.909 --> 01:57:22.449]  People that own these repair shops are now making videos about what they're finding when they take your phone apart.
[01:57:22.710 --> 01:57:25.170]  There is no 5G chip in these phones.
[01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:27.109]  I have two 5G phones in front of me.
[01:57:27.369 --> 01:57:29.909]  Right there is where the 5G chip is supposed to be.
[01:57:30.250 --> 01:57:32.609]  And right there is where the 5G chip is supposed to be.
[01:57:32.869 --> 01:57:36.449]  And again, I fix phones every day, so you can take me, you can take this from a reliable source.
[01:57:36.750 --> 01:57:48.270]  There's not a single phone in Canada that supports 5G. Of course, if we're going to have drones watching us and checkpoints and stay at home, lockdown, house arrest orders, of course they're going to tell the children, watch your parents.
[01:57:48.569 --> 01:57:53.970]  Because you see, 1984 for these guys is a owner's manual.
[01:57:55.479 --> 01:57:57.460]  It's an operations plan.
[01:57:57.819 --> 01:58:04.420]  Hillary Clinton's lessons of George Orwell's 1984 is to trust leaders, the press and experts.
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:11.720]  They're coming for you.
[01:58:12.279 --> 01:58:14.460]  They're coming for all of us.
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:24.279]  The incremental ambient background noise of the electromagnetic radiation is being jacked up on high.
[01:58:25.729 --> 01:58:32.350]  All over the world, people are watching 5G go in by their house, and the trees die within weeks.
[01:58:33.149 --> 01:58:34.489]  All on the left-hand side.
[01:58:35.090 --> 01:58:36.649]  Look at the left-hand side of that tree.
[01:58:36.909 --> 01:58:37.829]  Look at the right-hand side.
[01:58:40.329 --> 01:58:41.090]  That's all right.
[01:58:41.649 --> 01:58:41.829]  Yeah.
[01:58:42.710 --> 01:58:44.189]  Well, look at the right-hand side of the tree.
[01:58:44.289 --> 01:58:44.789]  Look at the plant.
[01:58:44.909 --> 01:58:45.409]  Look at the bushes.
[01:58:46.329 --> 01:58:47.409]  Look at the green bushes.
[01:58:47.550 --> 01:58:47.710]  Yeah.
[01:58:48.670 --> 01:58:49.409]  Very nice.
[01:58:50.949 --> 01:58:52.210]  Look at the left-hand side.
[01:58:54.750 --> 01:58:55.130]  Dead.
[01:58:55.609 --> 01:58:56.470]  Do you know why?
[01:58:57.569 --> 01:58:59.149]  Because that's right next to it.
[01:58:59.369 --> 01:59:04.149]  What we're seeing here is the crystallography of healthy spring water.
[01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:09.770]  What you'll notice are these kind of flower-like hexagons that are forming.
[01:59:10.010 --> 01:59:12.310]  They're indicative of spring water.
[01:59:12.649 --> 01:59:23.569]  Now here we have the same spring water that you just saw That had sat next to a 5G cell tower for 15 minutes only.
[01:59:23.970 --> 01:59:27.329]  You can see how disordered it is structurally.
[01:59:27.850 --> 01:59:31.369]  In fact, in my opinion, it is completely destroyed.
[01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:40.949]  EMFSciences.org has 220 doctors and scientists from 39 countries who have looked at health effects from wireless radiation.
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:51.880]  And from their work and the work of others, we can clearly say that wireless radiation can cause cancer, neurological problems, immune system disorders, and reproductive harm.
[01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:54.420]  The grass begins to gnarle and brown.
[01:59:54.859 --> 01:59:57.100]  The birds move their nests.
[01:59:59.979 --> 02:00:12.479]  And the studies are coming out everywhere that the 5G towers are 3, 4, 5, 10 times stronger than even the FCC says they're allowed to have.
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:17.920]  And at the FCC agreed level, massive increases in cancer.
[02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:21.180]  Oh, you're burning inside now.
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:25.000]  That microwave's rubbing your molecules together.
[02:00:26.449 --> 02:00:27.729]  And you're burning inside.
[02:00:28.090 --> 02:00:30.550]  And soon, you will die.
[02:00:34.829 --> 02:00:42.250]  And the globalists think you're so stupid that when you're all dying, you won't even notice it.
[02:00:46.300 --> 02:00:48.539]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:48.659 --> 02:00:53.539]  I am Chase Geiser, your host for the next two hours, one hour and 54 minutes to be exact.
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:55.520]  I'm joined by Candice Horbach.
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:03.659]  Candice Horbach hosts the podcast Chatting with Candice where she exposes topics like identity, spirituality, and self-improvement through conversations with guests from different fields.
[02:01:03.939 --> 02:01:07.680]  She's active on social media where she shares her thoughts on beauty, wellness, mindfulness, and other things.
[02:01:07.979 --> 02:01:10.399]  Follow her on X and Instagram at Candice Horbach.
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:11.779]  Candice, it's an honor and a pleasure to be with you.
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:12.119]  How are you?
[02:01:12.279 --> 02:01:12.800]  I'm amazing.
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:13.760]  Thanks for having me back.
[02:01:14.340 --> 02:01:17.439]  Absolutely, always a joy to have you, always a good conversation.
[02:01:18.319 --> 02:01:26.859]  And it's always so overwhelming at the beginning of these segments because the news is crazy, the stacks are crazy, the world is crazy.
[02:01:27.439 --> 02:01:33.899]  Obviously, the big conversation that everybody's been having the last week or so, especially the last few days, has been centered around these drones.
[02:01:34.140 --> 02:01:36.119]  What do you think about the phenomenon that we're witnessing?
[02:01:36.609 --> 02:01:42.210]  I was hoping to get some information when I came here because I'm like, are they, first the big question is, are they human?
[02:01:42.329 --> 02:01:43.069]  Are they not human?
[02:01:43.729 --> 02:01:45.909]  No one has given a solid answer on that.
[02:01:46.050 --> 02:01:46.909]  There's no one convincing.
[02:01:47.149 --> 02:01:53.250]  And then everyone's talking about Project Bluebeam specifically, and then saying that they're going to be using this as a means for martial law.
[02:01:53.449 --> 02:01:56.029]  So you guys are privy to more than I am.
[02:01:56.170 --> 02:01:57.930]  So what's your take and what's the inside scoop?
[02:01:58.180 --> 02:01:58.420]  Sure.
[02:01:58.619 --> 02:02:03.359]  Well, the story has certainly developed since people started witnessing this phenomenon.
[02:02:03.579 --> 02:02:05.859]  And I watched a really good episode of Joe Rogan last night.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:11.140]  He had a guest on recently whose name escapes me, discussing all the details around this phenomenon.
[02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:12.979]  It's clear now that...
[02:02:12.979 --> 02:02:13.640]  Mike Benz?
[02:02:13.859 --> 02:02:14.960]  No, it wasn't Mike Benz.
[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:16.680]  I can't remember the gentleman's name, but...
[02:02:17.890 --> 02:02:26.430]  It's clear now that these are man-made, and a lot of the things that we're seeing in these videos that look bizarre do have reasonable explanations.
[02:02:26.670 --> 02:02:35.810]  Now, people explain away crazy things all the time erroneously, and they justify a phenomenon that is actually inexplicable with trying to rationalize it.
[02:02:36.010 --> 02:02:43.590]  So I'm not just saying that it's explained away because There's not something weird going on, but there's at least 800 of these devices flying around.
[02:02:43.810 --> 02:02:47.970]  They think that they're coming from the ocean and flying over the tri-state area.
[02:02:48.289 --> 02:02:54.489]  There's even reports as far inland as Ohio and off the west coast as well in Southern California.
[02:02:55.649 --> 02:03:16.489]  And originally, my thinking on this was that it was likely these drones were scanning for a dirty bomb or a nuclear weapon because I saw this compelling video of a drone manufacturer saying that he'd heard rumors that a Soviet-era Ukrainian nuclear weapon had gone missing and was destined for the United States and that this technology could be used to identify that.
[02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:38.750]  However, after the conversation that I had with Tom Sauer yesterday, who's an expert in dismantling, identifying, and neutralizing weapons of mass destruction, he's worked for the Navy, doing that specifically, very unlikely that they're looking for a nuclear weapon because we have so many other ways to detect weapons of mass destruction before it would get to the point where you'd have to use drones in terms of our ports,
[02:03:38.949 --> 02:03:40.470]  our roads, other things like that.
[02:03:41.670 --> 02:03:46.949]  I'm told and I believe, Tim, that there are shockingly few missing nuclear weapons.
[02:03:47.090 --> 02:03:52.170]  And those that are missing from the Soviet era would likely not even be functional.
[02:03:52.170 --> 02:03:59.390]  Because you have to have infrastructure to maintain them and actually keep them active just because of the nature of radioactive and nuclear technology.
[02:03:59.630 --> 02:04:04.829]  So it seems to me that there's one of two things going on here.
[02:04:05.590 --> 02:04:10.529]  Maybe a blue beam type thing where they were trying to shock and scare the populace.
[02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:18.420]  Maybe it's Chinese spy drones, but when the Chinese sent those balloons over a couple of years ago, we shot those down no problem.
[02:04:18.939 --> 02:04:30.260]  So Mayorka's coming out and saying, we can't shoot these drones down because we don't have that kind of authority is ridiculous because we know that our government has the authority and the power to shoot down foreign adversaries when they fly drones or radios or whatever into our airspace.
[02:04:30.399 --> 02:04:31.399]  I mean, it's a no-brainer.
[02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:39.260]  It goes all the way back to the Battle of Los Angeles in World War II when they saw a mysterious thing in the air off the coast of LA and there were all the tracer rounds from the anti-aircraft.
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:51.880]  I think what's going on here is we're escalating toward World War III and our government is more and more concerned about Chinese espionage.
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:05:04.180]  It's why they've come after TikTok so much because TikTok's data and Many of the commercial or consumer grade drones that are used throughout the United States are made in China.
[02:05:04.479 --> 02:05:17.079]  And I think there's a concern within our deep state, within the national security apparatus, that China is able to get sensitive information from consumer drones being used recreationally.
[02:05:17.279 --> 02:05:21.699]  They can track things like supply chain changes, landscape changes all over the country.
[02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:32.439]  Our government wants to legislate away the ability for consumers to use drones Because they like to control us, but also because they're concerned about China stealing that data.
[02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:38.180]  And as we get closer and closer to World War III, things like DJI drones that are made in China become more and more of a threat.
[02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:45.600]  Because if we were to activate and go to World War III with China, you'd see movement of weapons and systems and tanks and whatever all over the country.
[02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:54.439]  And if the enemy had drones flying all over our country during that time, then it would be a threat or a risk to the efficacy of that agenda.
[02:05:54.439 --> 02:05:55.500]  So what do you think?
[02:05:55.689 --> 02:06:01.529]  Well, so you posted this thing the other day, and you described all of the different kinds of razors, which I thought was amazing.
[02:06:01.909 --> 02:06:09.529]  And one of them, which is don't ascribe to malice what can be easily used, or which could easily be- Explained with incompetence.
[02:06:09.569 --> 02:06:10.109]  Right, exactly.
[02:06:10.409 --> 02:06:19.289]  So when it comes to- Like the lack of security that we seem to have in this country when it comes to Chinese espionage, for example, the cell towers.
[02:06:19.829 --> 02:06:26.029]  And they'll say, hey, we'll make the pieces for this cell tower for pennies on the dollar, but hey, it's Chinese equipment.
[02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:27.130]  And we're like, done.
[02:06:27.310 --> 02:06:30.829]  And then all of these cell towers happen to be next to military facilities.
[02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:33.899]  Is that incompetence or is there something more nefarious?
[02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:35.680]  Because to me, that's obvious.
[02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:46.899]  Whatever you're saving on money by using Chinese equipment and robotics, it doesn't justify the threat of national security.
[02:06:47.180 --> 02:06:48.439]  Yeah, that's a really good question.
[02:06:48.619 --> 02:06:53.039]  And it's complicated for me to respond to, but I'll do my best.
[02:06:54.079 --> 02:07:00.319]  I think a lot of the things that we see in terms of incompetence from the government are things that are run directly by the government.
[02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:04.159]  And that excludes much of the military-industrial complex.
[02:07:04.399 --> 02:07:08.100]  So most of the military-industrial complex is private contractors.
[02:07:08.539 --> 02:07:13.380]  The government cannot hire everyone as a full-time employee to do everything that our government does.
[02:07:13.500 --> 02:07:19.239]  So they use contractors for all sorts of things, especially things like research and development, obviously munitions.
[02:07:19.659 --> 02:07:24.199]  Obviously, when we want to develop a jet, they don't just Build their own jet making facility.
[02:07:24.359 --> 02:07:26.060]  They issue a contract to Boeing.
[02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:27.500]  Boeing makes the new jet, right?
[02:07:27.939 --> 02:07:38.420]  And so when I think of government incompetence, I think of things like the Department of Education or the DMV, things that the government is directly handling on their own without a lot of outside contractors.
[02:07:38.739 --> 02:07:41.199]  And then they always just totally screw it up.
[02:07:41.340 --> 02:07:49.500]  But with the military industrial complex, if there's one thing our government has done efficiently forever, it's wage war, go to war.
[02:07:50.220 --> 02:07:51.779]  Destroy and build up civilizations.
[02:07:52.020 --> 02:07:54.619]  Even though we don't win wars, winning wars isn't really the objective anymore.
[02:07:55.020 --> 02:08:04.100]  But our government is very efficient at neutralizing foreign threats, implanting false flags, getting us into wars and killing hundreds of thousands of people.
[02:08:04.279 --> 02:08:05.560]  We're very good at that.
[02:08:05.659 --> 02:08:09.699]  So with this specific issue with the Chinese thing- Mm-hm.
[02:08:10.100 --> 02:08:17.239]  Since it falls into the kind of military-industrial complex umbrella, I am less inclined to attribute it to incompetence.
[02:08:17.239 --> 02:08:39.520]  Though there is a lot of red tape and bureaucracy around Our deep state and our national security, it's simply much more aggressive and efficient than the other branches of the government where we're hiring DEI staffers to work full-time and come up with policy ideas about whether we're going to do Common Core in all of our schools and then it doesn't work and oh,
[02:08:39.659 --> 02:08:39.880]  sorry.
[02:08:40.140 --> 02:08:46.979]  But these military industrial contractors, they want to make a ton of money and they're very good at making a ton of money and they're very fat.
[02:08:47.010 --> 02:08:48.789]  Oh, you want a jet that does this, this, and this?
[02:08:48.850 --> 02:08:51.250]  We'll get it to you next year, and it's going to cost you a trillion dollars, right?
[02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:52.970]  Okay, all we have to do is write the check.
[02:08:53.109 --> 02:08:57.270]  So with this specific issue, I don't think that...
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:04.159]  If they allowed it to happen, my gut tells me that it's because there was an agenda behind that.
[02:09:04.479 --> 02:09:15.000]  And I think that with this drone thing, we see the Kirby's and the Mayorkus' come out and say, a lot of these are instances of just consumer grade drones going up or commercially licensed drones.
[02:09:15.159 --> 02:09:15.899]  And that's true.
[02:09:16.060 --> 02:09:19.859]  But the reason all those drones are going up are in response to the initial barrage of drones.
[02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:23.640]  And they're sending their own drones up to look at it because their attention is drawn to it.
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:26.420]  And so something is actively happening.
[02:09:28.199 --> 02:09:37.720]  If it truly is Chinese espionage, which may be the case, I don't understand why these devices aren't being shot down like the balloons were.
[02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:39.439]  And why are they out at night, though, too?
[02:09:39.579 --> 02:09:43.840]  So if they're not looking for a nuclear weapon, if they're just trying to get intel, why are they out at night?
[02:09:44.180 --> 02:09:44.920]  Yeah, that's a good question.
[02:09:45.100 --> 02:10:01.180]  So based on the information that I've gathered from basically listening to the Joe Rogan podcast from yesterday, these devices are not giving off heat signatures, and they're not detectable by a lot of the systems that we traditionally use to detect stuff like this.
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:09.189]  And they believe that a lot of the Tools that the drones are using are passive rather than active.
[02:10:09.369 --> 02:10:10.670]  So radar is something that's active.
[02:10:10.689 --> 02:10:12.649]  You send out a signal and it bounces back.
[02:10:12.789 --> 02:10:17.229]  It's a lot easier to track when a device is using radar because it has to send something out actively.
[02:10:17.489 --> 02:10:21.850]  If it's passive like a camera lens, you can't necessarily detect it because it's just receiving light, right?
[02:10:23.989 --> 02:10:39.869]  The only thing I can rationalize, if it is espionage, the reason they would do it at night would be because when they go back to wherever it is over the ocean that they're undetectable, they can turn off their lights and fly back and it would be less likely to find out where they're going.
[02:10:40.130 --> 02:10:41.510]  That's the only thing I can think of.
[02:10:41.649 --> 02:10:43.930]  That's a good question because drones can't really see anything at night.
[02:10:44.710 --> 02:10:46.310]  But everybody can see the drones when they're lit up.
[02:10:46.449 --> 02:10:50.770]  Maybe if it happened during the day, it wouldn't be as viral because they'd be much more difficult to notice.
[02:10:50.909 --> 02:10:55.689]  And maybe the whole purpose of doing it at night is because they want everybody to be alarmed about this thing so they can pass new legislation.
[02:10:55.949 --> 02:11:02.649]  So do you think that is tied to potentially to Project Bluebeam and they really are trying to just scare the people and say, look at the aliens are coming?
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:11.859]  I don't think they're trying to convince the people that aliens are coming, but I do think that they're trying to alarm the people about the drone thing.
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:15.539]  So it doesn't have to be aliens in order for the people to be scared, right?
[02:11:16.180 --> 02:11:20.140]  It didn't have to be like a UFO flying into the towers on 9-11 in order for people to get freaked out.
[02:11:20.260 --> 02:11:21.300]  I mean, it was terrible enough.
[02:11:21.479 --> 02:11:26.229]  And so I don't think it's so much Bluebeam in the sense that they're trying to fake an invasion.
[02:11:26.710 --> 02:11:33.369]  But I do think that they're trying to exaggerate or inflate a security risk in order to justify legislation.
[02:11:33.369 --> 02:11:34.350]  And there's a pattern of that.
[02:11:34.449 --> 02:11:38.909]  I was gonna say, so is this also kind of like the next iteration of COVID, right?
[02:11:39.010 --> 02:11:43.810]  So we did COVID, we did the lockdowns, we stripped away so many human rights from people.
[02:11:44.189 --> 02:11:46.510]  And most people did a lot of it willingly.
[02:11:46.810 --> 02:11:50.010]  Was that, did that look good to the powers that be?
[02:11:50.109 --> 02:11:52.789]  So now they're like, we can do the next thing and the people will still comply.
[02:11:53.140 --> 02:11:57.359]  Sure, and COVID's a really good example because it was totally manufactured.
[02:11:57.380 --> 02:12:05.380]  It wasn't just an instance of, oh, an earthquake happened or a tsunami happened and we're going to take advantage of this crisis in order to exploit it for political gain.
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:06.720]  They literally...
[02:12:07.539 --> 02:12:13.020]  We've funded the gain of function research in the Wuhan Institute for Virology, made the virus.
[02:12:13.319 --> 02:12:23.880]  China released it and disabled all flights domestically within China in and out of Wuhan for months while allowing international flights in and out of Wuhan.
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:28.239]  Spread it intentionally throughout the world without spreading it domestically.
[02:12:28.359 --> 02:12:31.260]  They tried to stop spreading it within China, but they wanted the rest of the world to get it.
[02:12:31.539 --> 02:12:38.920]  And then, obviously, the vaccine response and the policy responses were totally manufactured and harmful and beneficial only to the political class as well.
[02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:55.810]  And so go back to 9-11, if you go back to Pearl Harbor, if you go back to USS Liberty, if you go back to Gulf of Tonkin, I mean, every decade at least, if not every five years, there's a major example of a manufactured or orchestrated crisis or problem that's used to justify legislation that consolidates more political power.
[02:12:55.949 --> 02:13:02.489]  So I think that this is intentionally being allowed to happen because they're trying to push for policy and they want the public to accept it.
[02:13:02.550 --> 02:13:21.869]  So if we can freak enough people out about what's going on with these drones, then we can increase the regulation and the monitoring of the Mm-hmm.
[02:13:24.789 --> 02:13:27.449]  Mm-hmm.
[02:13:28.250 --> 02:13:30.390]  Using a language like that, they've definitely teased that.
[02:13:30.729 --> 02:13:35.270]  They would not want consumers to have access to drone technology in the event of a domestic conflict.
[02:13:35.449 --> 02:13:40.710]  And so I honestly do think that the long game, at least, is martial law, because...
[02:13:42.020 --> 02:13:44.079]  Governments are just so eager to seize all power.
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:46.899]  The question is, when is it going to happen?
[02:13:47.020 --> 02:13:51.800]  It's so much easier to predict what's going to happen than it is to predict when it's going to happen.
[02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:58.939]  Peter Schiff, for example, for a long time has been talking about how the dollar is going to collapse because it's a fiat global reserve currency based on fractional reserve banking.
[02:13:59.079 --> 02:13:59.960]  He's absolutely right.
[02:14:00.159 --> 02:14:03.699]  The challenge is, is it going to happen in 100 years or is it going to happen in 5 years?
[02:14:03.859 --> 02:14:05.340]  Because those are two completely different outcomes.
[02:14:05.439 --> 02:14:12.829]  One of the things that's most What's so amazing about Alex Jones is that he predicted 9-11 at least twice with great detail the year that it happened.
[02:14:13.310 --> 02:14:20.250]  If he was complaining in the 70s that terrorists were going to fly buildings into planes and then it happened 40 years later, I'd be like, whatever.
[02:14:20.670 --> 02:14:22.850]  But all year, he's like, call the White House.
[02:14:22.989 --> 02:14:26.750]  Tell them we're not going to buy it when they blame Osama bin Laden for attacking the World Trade Center.
[02:14:26.869 --> 02:14:29.710]  He was saying that that year, that adds a lot of credence to it.
[02:14:29.829 --> 02:14:33.010]  So martial law, yes, I do think that's the long game.
[02:14:33.649 --> 02:14:37.520]  But I'm not certain that it's gonna happen in the next 30 days.
[02:14:37.699 --> 02:14:38.159]  Maybe it will.
[02:14:38.239 --> 02:14:38.600]  What do you think?
[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:40.399]  I don't think in the next 30 days, no.
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:50.840]  And then the thing that also is infuriating is they've done all of this gaslighting for so long that if there is a legitimate risk for the people, then it's gonna be a lot harder to believe.
[02:14:51.079 --> 02:14:54.920]  Because we've seen so many things be concocted over the last however many years.
[02:14:55.770 --> 02:14:59.550]  So that's the thing too, is how do you discern what's an actual threat?
[02:14:59.729 --> 02:15:05.029]  And I guess maybe it doesn't matter because the answer is never giving up your freedoms.
[02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:07.890]  That's not gonna solve the problem either way.
[02:15:08.029 --> 02:15:17.329]  But how do you discern between what is a real threat to you and your family or your state, whatever it is, versus they're just trying to scare you so that they can take from you?
[02:15:17.630 --> 02:15:18.069]  100%.
[02:15:19.530 --> 02:15:22.010]  Ultimately, it's just about waking up and being aware.
[02:15:22.310 --> 02:15:35.010]  So unfortunately, in 2001, there wasn't enough critical mass within the alternative media space for someone like Alex Jones to reach enough people so that when 9-11 happened, people didn't fall for it, right?
[02:15:35.369 --> 02:15:37.869]  Like, yes, he predicted it, but the audiences were smaller.
[02:15:38.010 --> 02:15:40.029]  There was much more trust in the establishment institutions.
[02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:48.550]  The conservative base was much more eager to get into a conflict with radical Islamic terrorists for a litany of reasons.
[02:15:49.770 --> 02:15:55.470]  Now, I wonder, because let's just say, hypothetically, and I hope that this doesn't happen, I hope this isn't true, God forbid.
[02:15:55.810 --> 02:16:01.949]  Let's say, hypothetically, a dirty bomb goes off on January 20th at the inauguration, which would be like a radioactive bomb.
[02:16:02.069 --> 02:16:05.810]  It wouldn't be quite a nuke, but it would radiate the area and make it uninhabitable.
[02:16:05.949 --> 02:16:10.250]  Let's say, for example, a nuke goes off in D.C. on January 20th.
[02:16:12.090 --> 02:16:17.869]  If that happens, and I see this happen, first thing I'm going to think to myself is, alright, there's no way that it was Russian.
[02:16:18.050 --> 02:16:22.390]  There's no way that it was Chinese because we have all the security in place to prevent that from happening.
[02:16:22.970 --> 02:16:28.010]  If it happens, I'm going to immediately think that it was our own government that did it for whatever reason.
[02:16:28.449 --> 02:16:35.690]  You eradicate this administration, then you can blame whatever enemy you want, justify going to World War III, which seems to be something that they want to do.
[02:16:35.950 --> 02:16:38.469]  I'm going to just immediately know and think that it's an inside job.
[02:16:38.590 --> 02:16:41.329]  The question is, What are the people gonna think?
[02:16:41.430 --> 02:16:46.989]  Because when 9-11 happened, everyone immediately bought the official narrative that was given from the government.
[02:16:47.729 --> 02:16:59.049]  If a dirty bomb goes off, or a nuclear bomb, God forbid, goes off in the inauguration, and the government comes out and says that the isotopes indicate that it's a Russian bomb, are the people in America gonna believe that?
[02:16:59.209 --> 02:16:59.829]  What do you think?
[02:17:01.059 --> 02:17:01.799]  I think so.
[02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:04.100]  I think a lot of people will, unfortunately.
[02:17:04.379 --> 02:17:04.520]  Yeah.
[02:17:04.639 --> 02:17:10.540]  Because it's hard to imagine that level of malice within your own people.
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:12.459]  I think for a lot of people, right?
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:14.379]  It's like you don't want to imagine the worst.
[02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:14.700]  Right.
[02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:18.020]  It's easier to have someone else to outsource the villain.
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:21.139]  Yeah, nobody wants to think that their own government would do that, too.
[02:17:21.139 --> 02:17:21.760]  Right, exactly.
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:23.399]  It's almost like Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:17:23.700 --> 02:17:24.319]  It is.
[02:17:24.379 --> 02:17:26.079]  It's like an abusive relationship, 100%.
[02:17:27.639 --> 02:17:41.530]  I think what people don't realize is that our government especially the intelligence community adopts a utilitarian philosophy which means that Killing one person is justified if it means saving ten people, right?
[02:17:41.809 --> 02:17:46.610]  And that's generally considered immoral by the traditional Christian interpretation, right?
[02:17:46.829 --> 02:17:50.889]  You're not supposed to kill anybody or murder no matter what, even if it means you're gonna save ten innocent people.
[02:17:51.069 --> 02:17:55.549]  If you engage in these hypotheticals, it's a bad winding road that can lead to the dark side.
[02:17:55.649 --> 02:18:10.809]  But when you're in intelligence and you're operating for the world's leading superpower and there's so much at stake, We're good to go.
[02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:24.469]  There's gonna be much more death from starvation or much more death from lack of access to healthcare.
[02:18:24.809 --> 02:18:36.569]  And so they're thinking it's okay to allow 3,000 innocent people to die on 9-11 if it means that they can save the currency and prevent the ramifications of a currency collapse, right?
[02:18:36.649 --> 02:18:48.739]  So if we have to unseat Gaddafi in Libya because he's talking about his own currency, Yes, it's terrible that we're going through and invaded the country and bombing them and murdering this guy just because he has a different opinion than us.
[02:18:48.879 --> 02:18:53.120]  But if it means saving the dollars, the global reserve currency, that's gonna be tens of millions of lives.
[02:18:53.219 --> 02:18:55.819]  So they operate on this like one life for 10 lives.
[02:18:55.920 --> 02:18:56.940]  They're like bidding on lives.
[02:18:57.100 --> 02:19:04.879]  And so if they do a dirty bomb or a false flag operation in the United States, you have to understand that they morally think that they're actually doing the right thing.
[02:19:05.159 --> 02:19:19.000]  Yes, it's terrible that we eradicated an entirely democratically elected administration in this conflict, but this administration Was not going to be conducive to us protecting our interests overseas, which ultimately would have amounted to more deaths over the course of the 21st century in the United States.
[02:19:19.020 --> 02:19:22.020]  And how many assumptions have to be made for that as well, right?
[02:19:22.159 --> 02:19:24.620]  How accurate can we forecast?
[02:19:24.940 --> 02:19:26.379]  I mean, unless you're Alex Jones, of course.
[02:19:27.790 --> 02:19:35.030]  His percentage of being correct is really impressive, but most people you can't accurately forecast that far out.
[02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:40.750]  So even if your math is I'm saving 10,000 people by doing this thing, that's a huge assumption.
[02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:46.190]  Well, that is the whole crux of the problem with utilitarianism, what you just said right there.
[02:19:50.579 --> 02:19:54.100]  That's why we just have to do the right thing no matter what.
[02:19:54.299 --> 02:19:56.659]  You never want to do the wrong thing for the right reasons.
[02:19:57.260 --> 02:20:08.120]  Because when you start playing that game of doing the wrong thing for the right reasons, it requires a certain amount of self-righteousness, and you're going to make mistakes that are going to lead to disastrous catastrophes.
[02:20:08.500 --> 02:20:10.440]  We've seen this countless times throughout history.
[02:20:10.979 --> 02:20:15.059]  And so their level of hubris, and in my opinion, there's a lot of reasons for this.
[02:20:15.139 --> 02:20:22.250]  A lot of it is because There's a loss of faith in God in our culture over the last hundred years.
[02:20:22.450 --> 02:20:27.590]  I mean, when Nietzsche said God is dead, he didn't mean that God lived at one point in time and then literally died and we don't have a God anymore.
[02:20:27.790 --> 02:20:35.590]  He meant that as an active force in our culture, God is dead because we've engaged in this path of science.
[02:20:35.649 --> 02:20:41.989]  And I don't think science and God are incompatible whatsoever, but there was definitely a trend where that was kind of where it was going in terms of the perspective of the scientists.
[02:20:42.229 --> 02:20:57.909]  And when you lose morality and principles and you start making Decisions like this based off of your own self-righteousness and hubris and presumptions about what you think is better and worse, then you inadvertently cause all sorts of harm and conflict.
[02:20:58.129 --> 02:21:09.370]  So case in point with this is World War II ends and we make the dollar the global reserve currency, which was great for everybody basically in the world until we went off of the gold standard.
[02:21:10.170 --> 02:21:16.530]  And now as a result of us going off of the gold standard, maybe it seemed like it was the right idea at the time.
[02:21:18.510 --> 02:21:27.229]  But that has caused us to go back to wars every single decade because we have to ensure that oil is traded using US dollars in order to prop up our currency.
[02:21:27.489 --> 02:21:32.209]  And anytime there's a threat to whether oil overseas will be traded in US dollars, we always get into war.
[02:21:32.329 --> 02:21:45.629]  So because of the monetary system that we set up, because of this utilitarian approach, this short term gain, long term loss philosophy that we have, we have guaranteed basically that we're going to be at war forever until there's a different monetary system, which is why I hope Bitcoin takes over.
[02:21:45.889 --> 02:21:47.389]  Yes, sir, I do too.
[02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:53.170]  Yeah, and then Peter Schiff was recently tweeting that he thinks Bitcoin is a threat to national security.
[02:21:53.350 --> 02:21:54.750]  And I'm like, it's the opposite.
[02:21:55.010 --> 02:21:56.750]  It is the opposite for the people.
[02:21:57.010 --> 02:22:05.729]  If you're gonna do anything criminal or launder or pay for certain acts that you don't want people to know, you're gonna use cash.
[02:22:06.030 --> 02:22:07.450]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:22:07.770 --> 02:22:11.610]  Yes, you can use Bitcoin for sure, but that's always been an issue.
[02:22:11.610 --> 02:22:13.250]  That's been an issue with the dollar as well.
[02:22:13.469 --> 02:22:20.450]  I think the issue with Bitcoin specifically is the question of whether or not it's been compromised, and it can be tracked.
[02:22:20.670 --> 02:22:27.549]  So when Bitcoin first came out, it was famous for this blockchain technology where there was total anonymity.
[02:22:27.729 --> 02:22:29.590]  It was a safe way for people to transact.
[02:22:29.809 --> 02:22:31.649]  I mean, it's a free black market.
[02:22:31.790 --> 02:22:33.469]  It's a capitalist utopia.
[02:22:33.469 --> 02:22:34.469]  I totally support it.
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:47.340]  But the question is, are there ways that the government can go through, can they purchase enough of the nodes to track these transactions and the people just have this facade that they're- I don't think so, because it slows down, right?
[02:22:47.500 --> 02:22:50.399]  Every minute, the mining is slowing down.
[02:22:50.600 --> 02:22:58.899]  So even if they were to acquire a large sum of it, the time that it would take to mine more coins, and obviously there's a finite amount, I don't think so.
[02:22:59.059 --> 02:22:59.799]  Yeah, I hope you're right.
[02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:01.399]  I think blockchain technology is a wonder.
[02:23:01.719 --> 02:23:03.260]  But I mean, that's a whole rabbit hole.
[02:23:03.379 --> 02:23:04.340]  Folks, we're coming up on a break.
[02:23:04.700 --> 02:23:05.180]  Stay tuned.
[02:23:05.540 --> 02:23:09.280]  More clips, news, and analysis on the other side with Candace Horbach.
[02:23:09.479 --> 02:23:13.459]  And make sure you visit thealexjonesstore.com and be the reason Alex will always be on the air.
[02:23:14.039 --> 02:23:20.659]  My dad is chemistry background, also a retired doctor, but he came in to help me run my supplement division 13 years ago.
[02:23:21.180 --> 02:23:22.479]  The deep state sued the hell out of him.
[02:23:22.600 --> 02:23:23.899]  We're going to our guest in a moment, but I got to do this.
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:24.319]  Thank you, sir.
[02:23:24.899 --> 02:23:28.500]  And they basically almost destroyed my parents.
[02:23:28.620 --> 02:23:31.100]  They didn't even complain until I heard about it from family.
[02:23:31.540 --> 02:23:35.040]  My dad was at the edge of bankruptcy himself with all the lawsuits the Democrats filed.
[02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:39.000]  By the way, they said in court that their attorney's fees are 316 million yesterday.
[02:23:39.440 --> 02:23:41.979]  They filed before they spent 80 million suing me.
[02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:43.819]  We spent 16 million fighting them.
[02:23:44.079 --> 02:23:45.700]  My dad spent 2 million fighting them.
[02:23:45.739 --> 02:23:46.840]  And we're finally winning.
[02:23:47.079 --> 02:23:53.979]  Not only does my dad's supplement company, drjonesnationals.com, have some of the best supplements, it is a personal request, I ask you.
[02:23:54.010 --> 02:23:58.370]  To support him because he's been a sponsor and wouldn't tell me in the last few years he was out of money.
[02:23:58.709 --> 02:24:08.549]  He was giving everything to Infowars and then personally going through his savings and selling things he had and not telling me because that's how dads are.
[02:24:08.989 --> 02:24:10.069]  My mother wouldn't tell me.
[02:24:10.209 --> 02:24:16.329]  Then when I found out about this a few months ago when they were out of town, I went and dug through all his finances in his office and I got pissed.
[02:24:17.180 --> 02:24:24.079]  So, it is a personal thing for me, a warrior who fights for you every day, and my own future as well, to ask you, I need your help.
[02:24:24.540 --> 02:24:25.780]  The supplements are there.
[02:24:25.940 --> 02:24:26.579]  They're great.
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:27.920]  He's got a bunch more coming in.
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:29.280]  He's put everything into it he has.
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:29.940]  They're incredible.
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:39.899]  I've given so much to this fight, and I respectfully ask all of you, every person listening, because such a tiny fraction of you ever actually go buy anything, that I don't want to belabor this.
[02:24:39.899 --> 02:24:41.200]  We have important topics to cover.
[02:24:42.030 --> 02:24:43.270]  Please support us.
[02:24:43.469 --> 02:24:45.489]  Go to drjonesdactuals.com.

[02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:05.909]  And my dad literally...
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:12.040]  We took a loan last week to be able to buy the product that's coming in finally next week.
[02:25:12.219 --> 02:25:14.319]  Turbo Force, things like that that are popular.
[02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:17.020]  So we're trying to stabilize something that's important.
[02:25:17.540 --> 02:25:21.500]  And the enemy can get us so down to burn us out and shut us down.
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:23.180]  My dad won't stop fighting.
[02:25:23.319 --> 02:25:23.940]  He's a fighter.
[02:25:24.059 --> 02:25:24.920]  Hell, he is my dad.
[02:25:25.079 --> 02:25:26.020]  I think I'm a fighter.
[02:25:26.260 --> 02:25:27.659]  They wouldn't even tell me this stuff.
[02:25:28.319 --> 02:25:35.860]  We need to sell out of the little bit of stuff they got left just to get the next three or four products that are finally coming in to get them back on their feet so they can be a sponsor.
[02:25:36.059 --> 02:25:38.700]  But this point, it's not even about sponsoring the Alex Jones Show.
[02:25:38.860 --> 02:25:39.780]  It's about my parents.
[02:25:40.379 --> 02:25:45.860]  And if you think I can continue to fight the globalists when my parents are being destroyed, that's what the enemy targeted them.
[02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:49.379]  So, please, support the Infowar today.
[02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:51.500]  Support my mother and my father.
[02:25:51.559 --> 02:25:54.500]  I'm asking you personally for you to do it now.
[02:25:54.719 --> 02:25:59.219]  And if 5% of the millions watching me go do it, all our problems will be over in one minute.
[02:25:59.340 --> 02:26:04.860]  But it's less than one-half, one percent to ever buy anything from drjonesnaturals.com, thealexjonesstore.com.
[02:26:04.940 --> 02:26:08.500]  And for those that do support, thank you for keeping us in the fight for our futures.
[02:26:08.899 --> 02:26:12.180]  So, thealexjonesstore.com, drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:26:12.260 --> 02:26:13.780]  I'm going to shut up at the balance of this hour.
[02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:22.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, where we are the watchtower of the New World Order, globalist elite trying to take over.
[02:26:22.399 --> 02:26:31.040]  And there's some major viral news happening right now all over X. The crew just gave me a stack of screenshots of posts.
[02:26:32.059 --> 02:26:34.659]  And I mean, we knew this was coming.
[02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:39.739]  Speaker Johnson was obviously a problem from the beginning.
[02:26:40.950 --> 02:26:45.010]  He came in and immediately started acting like a uniparty hack.
[02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:49.450]  And I know that Trump has been seen with him.
[02:26:49.549 --> 02:26:50.430]  Trump has had his back.
[02:26:51.010 --> 02:26:54.430]  This guy is a professional politician.
[02:26:54.430 --> 02:26:58.129]  I'm going to show you this clip in a second, the one that they have on screen here.
[02:26:58.149 --> 02:27:00.770]  But we've got this omnibus bill.
[02:27:01.409 --> 02:27:04.450]  Speaker Johnson saying he doesn't like it, but we have to get this done.
[02:27:05.389 --> 02:27:07.649]  What do you mean we have to get it done?
[02:27:07.709 --> 02:27:08.829]  If it's not good, don't pass it.
[02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:10.450]  We were just talking about utilitarian, right?
[02:27:10.690 --> 02:27:19.069]  I don't like the fact that we have to bomb the Twin Towers in order to get into the Middle East to save the global reserve currency status of the United States, but we just have to get it done.
[02:27:19.409 --> 02:27:20.409]  Someone's got to do it.
[02:27:20.549 --> 02:27:20.670]  Right?
[02:27:21.030 --> 02:27:21.870]  Someone's got to do it.
[02:27:21.889 --> 02:27:23.610]  And if not us, who?
[02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:24.889]  If not now, then when?
[02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:25.809]  So noble.
[02:27:26.010 --> 02:27:26.629]  Yeah, so noble.
[02:27:26.750 --> 02:27:31.510]  And so Elon Musk posted this tweet, we're funding bioweapon labs in this bill.
[02:27:32.559 --> 02:27:36.760]  Breaking new congressional resolution bill includes funding for at least 12 new biolabs.
[02:27:37.459 --> 02:27:45.780]  Secretary shall make awards to establish or maintain as applicable not fewer than 12 regional biocontainment laboratories.
[02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:52.459]  Shall make awards to establish or maintain as applicable not fewer than 12. List the purposes.
[02:27:52.639 --> 02:27:55.799]  Rapid response to biological agents including emergency infectious diseases.
[02:27:56.960 --> 02:28:02.620]  Supporting information sharing between and the dissemination of findings to researchers and other relevant individuals to facilitate.
[02:28:02.879 --> 02:28:06.879]  Apparently it allocates a trillion dollars for another pandemic response.
[02:28:07.059 --> 02:28:17.639]  So if you thought 2020 was bad, just wait till January 21st happens and all these diseases that they've been bragging they're going to release get released on the public right at the beginning of the next Trump administration.
[02:28:17.639 --> 02:28:19.639]  Let's watch this clip and unpack it on the other side.
[02:28:20.729 --> 02:28:21.430]  We don't have a choice.
[02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:22.370]  We have to fund those.
[02:28:22.549 --> 02:28:24.709]  We have to fund FEMA. We have to fund our farmers.
[02:28:24.889 --> 02:28:25.270]  Right.
[02:28:25.549 --> 02:28:28.409]  And Mr. Speaker, it's not just...
[02:28:28.409 --> 02:28:31.790]  So you've got a bunch of Republicans who are angry at you.
[02:28:31.950 --> 02:28:32.850]  They don't like this.
[02:28:33.229 --> 02:28:39.409]  And just in a couple of weeks, you're going to stand once again to run for Speaker of the House.
[02:28:39.569 --> 02:28:41.469]  And you don't need a bunch of Democrats mad at you.
[02:28:41.629 --> 02:28:44.850]  But you know, and this is breaking news you do not know.
[02:28:45.049 --> 02:28:47.069]  You know who also does not like this?
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:53.600]  Elon Musk, the world's richest man, just tweeted, this bill should not pass.
[02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:57.739]  The only way you're going to be able to pass it now, Mr. Speaker, is with Democrats.
[02:28:58.079 --> 02:29:01.299]  If you could, what's your message to Elon Musk?
[02:29:02.309 --> 02:29:04.930]  Well, I was communicating with Elon last night.
[02:29:05.069 --> 02:29:07.030]  Elon and Vivek and I are on a text chain together.
[02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:09.170]  And I was explaining to them the background of this.
[02:29:09.170 --> 02:29:09.809]  We're in a little text group.
[02:29:09.809 --> 02:29:11.549]  And Vivek and I talked last night about it at midnight.
[02:29:12.409 --> 02:29:13.909]  And he said, look, I get it.
[02:29:13.969 --> 02:29:14.690]  He said, we understand.
[02:29:14.690 --> 02:29:16.129]  You're in an impossible position.
[02:29:16.270 --> 02:29:17.010]  Everybody knows that.
[02:29:17.149 --> 02:29:20.590]  Remember, guys, we still have just a razor-thin margin of Republicans.
[02:29:20.590 --> 02:29:22.729]  So any bill has to have Democrat votes.
[02:29:22.930 --> 02:29:24.090]  They understand the situation.
[02:29:24.190 --> 02:29:27.209]  They said, it's not directed to you, Mr. Speaker, but we don't like the spending.
[02:29:27.229 --> 02:29:28.229]  I said, guess what, fellas?
[02:29:28.309 --> 02:29:28.969]  I don't either.
[02:29:29.309 --> 02:29:31.370]  We've got to get this done because here's the key.
[02:29:31.690 --> 02:29:38.530]  By doing this, we are clearing the decks and we are setting up for Trump to come in roaring back with the America First agenda.
[02:29:38.690 --> 02:29:45.290]  That's what we're going to run with gusto beginning January 3rd when we start the new Congress when Republicans, again, are in control.
[02:29:45.530 --> 02:29:52.989]  And all of our fiscal conservative friends, I'm one of them, will be able to finally do the things that we've been wanting to do the last couple years right now.
[02:29:53.219 --> 02:29:56.139]  Democrats still control the pens, and that's the problem.
[02:29:56.139 --> 02:29:59.639]  What's it called when you put a whole bunch of stuff in a bill?
[02:30:00.079 --> 02:30:00.620]  Yeah, earmarks.
[02:30:00.639 --> 02:30:06.540]  Short-term funding measured, and we get to March where we can put our fingerprints on the spending.
[02:30:06.780 --> 02:30:09.180]  That's when the big changes start, and we can't wait to get there.
[02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:12.420]  This is exactly the utilitarian approach that we were talking about.
[02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:18.540]  This idea of compromise, and Ayn Rand actually did a great job of talking about the difference between a deal and a compromise.
[02:30:18.780 --> 02:30:23.559]  She was a laissez-faire capitalist and objectivist, and she was imperfect in many ways, but she was right on the money with this.
[02:30:23.719 --> 02:30:28.760]  The difference between a deal and a compromise, in a deal, both parties gain something, they gain value.
[02:30:28.940 --> 02:30:32.000]  In a compromise, both parties lose something.
[02:30:32.299 --> 02:30:36.620]  And those who compromise in leadership become themselves compromised.
[02:30:37.590 --> 02:30:45.329]  And so we've got Speaker Johnson going up there saying that, look, I don't like this bill either, but it does more good than harm.
[02:30:45.670 --> 02:30:55.629]  So I'm willing to set aside my principles that are opposed to many of the things that we're funding in this bill for the sake of an outcome that I think will be a net positive.
[02:30:55.950 --> 02:30:57.030]  That's what he's saying there.
[02:30:57.149 --> 02:31:01.090]  And there's a story in the Old Testament where they're carrying the Ark of the Covenant.
[02:31:01.350 --> 02:31:19.510]  And I love the Old Testament because regardless of whether you believe that it's historically true, There's still a metaphysical truth to every story in it and God had told We're good to go.
[02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:49.200]  That's why we cannot sustain this utilitarian philosophy where we're always doing bad things for good reasons.
[02:31:49.379 --> 02:31:54.420]  We're always doing the wrong thing for the right reasons because it just makes us compromised and eroded.
[02:31:54.579 --> 02:31:57.219]  I mean, what do you think about What's his justification?
[02:31:57.219 --> 02:32:04.860]  So what is the benefit that he's saying is worth this trillion dollar spend or reserve and then also 12 more labs?
[02:32:05.059 --> 02:32:06.959]  And then what is the benefit of these labs?
[02:32:07.219 --> 02:32:13.700]  Because if everyone else in the world is doing it and they're making bioweapons, then you can easily say, well, then we have to do it too.
[02:32:13.840 --> 02:32:16.379]  But then it goes back to a mass amount of assumptions.
[02:32:16.719 --> 02:32:21.379]  And then obviously they leak accidentally or on purpose, sometimes both.
[02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:27.610]  It's assuming that you're smarter than nature in a lot of ways, which historically we've never been.
[02:32:28.149 --> 02:32:28.610]  Yeah.
[02:32:30.129 --> 02:32:31.350]  It's a catch-22.
[02:32:32.010 --> 02:32:42.190]  It's a chicken or an egg thing because they justify biolabs saying that we have to do research on these pathogens in order to prepare in the event of a biological attack.
[02:32:42.389 --> 02:32:44.950]  But research is different than trying to make them more deadly.
[02:32:45.309 --> 02:32:46.549]  But the research also...
[02:32:46.549 --> 02:32:50.110]  Yeah, you have to make them more deadly in order to do the research for the vaccine.
[02:32:50.190 --> 02:32:51.370]  So they're making the problem.
[02:32:51.530 --> 02:32:52.469]  It's like if you had to...
[02:32:52.930 --> 02:32:55.889]  We're good to go.
[02:33:08.889 --> 02:33:10.450]  And we had at least a dozen.
[02:33:10.450 --> 02:33:11.590]  I can't remember the exact number.
[02:33:11.709 --> 02:33:12.670]  Maybe the crew can look this up.
[02:33:12.829 --> 02:33:17.329]  We had a bunch of biolabs that were operational in Ukraine, close to the border.
[02:33:17.889 --> 02:33:25.629]  And they were even bragging about this on the U.S. Embassy in Kiev YouTube channel where they uploaded a video that was a compilation.
[02:33:25.790 --> 02:33:26.909]  Guys, see if you can find that video.
[02:33:27.049 --> 02:33:28.729]  It's from 2018 or something.
[02:33:28.850 --> 02:33:32.729]  Just go to the U.S. Embassy of Kiev, biolabs in Ukraine, find that clip.
[02:33:32.969 --> 02:33:34.090]  We'll run it when you find it.
[02:33:34.520 --> 02:33:35.659]  And they're bragging about that.
[02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:36.680]  They're doing this.
[02:33:36.799 --> 02:33:39.239]  Now Ukraine's about ready to lose the war to Russia.
[02:33:39.399 --> 02:33:42.180]  Russia's already said that they've identified these biolabs.
[02:33:42.500 --> 02:33:43.920]  Russia's already known.
[02:33:44.620 --> 02:33:48.940]  It's already known that they're going to gain so much territory no matter how this conflict is resolved.
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:53.079]  And so, yeah, 25 to 30, according to Tulsi Gabbard, are currently there.
[02:33:53.180 --> 02:33:59.219]  So if we're going to lose access to the labs in Ukraine, that means that we have to get other labs so we can continue to do the same research.
[02:33:59.379 --> 02:34:02.799]  Now, I don't even know if these labs are going to be in the United States or if they're going to be in some other country.
[02:34:02.940 --> 02:34:10.260]  A lot of the research that we're doing in these labs has been outlawed in the United States, which is why we funded gain-of-function in China, because we can't do it here.
[02:34:10.299 --> 02:34:10.440]  How does that work?
[02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:17.639]  So it's illegal here, but we're allowed to do illegal activity outside of our country and have the government and the taxpayers pay for that?
[02:34:17.639 --> 02:34:18.260]  How does that make sense?
[02:34:18.379 --> 02:34:21.020]  Well, it doesn't morally make sense, but legally it does.
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:22.319]  So think about it like this.
[02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:24.139]  Child labor laws in the United States.
[02:34:24.319 --> 02:34:30.520]  Illegal to have child labor in the United States, you can't hire a 12-year-old and force them to work 18 hours a day with their little fingers sewing your shirts, right?
[02:34:30.959 --> 02:34:38.239]  But no problem if the battery in your iPhone was made from cobalt in a mine in Africa.
[02:34:39.420 --> 02:34:40.360]  Where children work.
[02:34:40.479 --> 02:34:42.120]  So we outsource slavery.
[02:34:42.440 --> 02:34:48.420]  We outsource child labor and humanitarian abuse on a massive scale, specifically to China.
[02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:51.379]  So this is just another example of that.
[02:34:51.500 --> 02:34:52.399]  Guys, do you have that clip ready?
[02:34:52.479 --> 02:34:53.500]  I know you found it on my X account.
[02:34:53.659 --> 02:34:54.860]  I'd like to show the audience this clip.
[02:34:55.159 --> 02:34:56.059]  Okay, they're working on it.
[02:34:56.559 --> 02:35:04.200]  Yeah, so it's not morally correct, but legally it is, because technically we're not the ones doing it if it's happening somewhere else.
[02:35:04.350 --> 02:35:11.170]  But if we're still spending taxpayer money, I feel like there should be some kind of contingency there, right?
[02:35:11.389 --> 02:35:11.510]  100%.
[02:35:11.510 --> 02:35:19.829]  Even though it's legal in these places that they're operating in, you shouldn't be able to use US taxpayer dollars for what is illegal in the country.
[02:35:20.479 --> 02:35:23.200]  Spoken like a true American champion right there, Candace.
[02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:24.559]  I 100% agree with you.
[02:35:24.780 --> 02:35:34.520]  And I hope that the Department of Government Efficiency and Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are able to identify examples of this and legislation can be passed.
[02:35:34.639 --> 02:35:46.079]  But that's why it's so important that we not only completely defeat and eradicate the leftists from all the institutions and halls of power, but that we also eradicate the neoconservative movement within the Republican Party.
[02:35:46.420 --> 02:35:51.340]  We have to convert the Republican Party into a MAGA populist party.
[02:35:51.479 --> 02:35:57.840]  Let's watch this clip from the US Embassy in Kyiv just from before the pandemic of them bragging about their bioweapons labs in Ukraine.
[02:35:59.139 --> 02:36:02.979]  The work we do in the Biological Threat Reduction Program is complicated.
[02:36:03.340 --> 02:36:08.440]  And it's difficult to communicate it sometimes to outside audiences.
[02:36:08.819 --> 02:36:14.260]  And I think our adversaries like Russia can take advantage of that with some of the propaganda that they put out.
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:18.840]  The Biological Threat Reduction Program is working in 27 countries.
[02:36:19.100 --> 02:36:25.579]  We feel this disinformation and misinformation is done just to really exploit divisions.
[02:36:25.819 --> 02:36:34.260]  We've had accusations that some research projects were being used to create threats, not to identify threats and reduce them.
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:39.139]  Ulterior motives are being injected where none exist.
[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:43.579]  We've built these capabilities for the partners, their central reference labs for research.
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:45.760]  They publish everything they do.
[02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:50.219]  They invite the international community Into their laboratories.
[02:36:50.579 --> 02:36:55.360]  They're working on behalf and the benefit of the people of their respective countries.
[02:36:55.719 --> 02:37:02.520]  Kazakhstan, like many of the other republics in the former Soviet Union, had biological weapons.
[02:37:02.940 --> 02:37:04.059]  Russia media has attacked...
[02:37:04.059 --> 02:37:13.280]  Listen to that music they have in the background, this optimistic, inspirational corporate piano as they talk about how, oh, we're only doing research and we're only containing these dangerous pathogens.
[02:37:13.819 --> 02:37:20.620]  But doing the research is creating the problem as well, just like the gain-of-function research that was done in Wuhan.
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:22.280]  And you know that they're massive weapons.
[02:37:22.379 --> 02:37:29.420]  You know this is part of the reason why Russia was so eager to get engaged in this conflict with Ukraine as Ukraine approached NATO and vice versa.
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:32.680]  This type of thing just makes me sick.
[02:37:32.780 --> 02:37:34.219]  I mean, what do you think as you watch this?
[02:37:34.350 --> 02:37:50.049]  It makes me so sad, and it honestly makes me a little bit hopeless, which normally I'm not, just because you mentioned the music specifically, and it makes me think of Joe Dispenza's work, and he talks about priming and how our subconscious works.
[02:37:50.270 --> 02:37:55.729]  And when we run pharmaceutical ads, for example, all of that is so intentional.
[02:37:55.930 --> 02:38:01.190]  These people are masters of psychology, and it's how can I evoke this feeling in you?
[02:38:01.540 --> 02:38:10.219]  To get you sick to a place where now you're asking your doctor for this medication and now you're on 10 other ones for all of the side effects.
[02:38:10.319 --> 02:38:11.159]  It's the same thing with this.
[02:38:11.299 --> 02:38:19.420]  It's like, how do I evoke inspiration and technology and the betterment of scientific advancement?
[02:38:19.639 --> 02:38:21.040]  And it's like, this works.
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:23.920]  And to me, that sucks that I know that it works.
[02:38:24.299 --> 02:38:24.700]  100%.
[02:38:24.889 --> 02:38:34.729]  People need to be able to unplug in a way and find their soul again, find their intuition, and stop letting these people program.
[02:38:34.889 --> 02:38:35.489]  That's what it is.
[02:38:35.629 --> 02:38:37.489]  You're just watching live programming.
[02:38:37.709 --> 02:38:43.850]  And if you wake up and you're conscious, Then these methods are so much less effective.
[02:38:43.850 --> 02:38:44.049]  It doesn't work.
[02:38:44.190 --> 02:38:45.530]  It's almost comical, right?
[02:38:45.709 --> 02:38:47.149]  You're like, look how cute that music is.
[02:38:47.149 --> 02:38:47.729]  It's only when you're not paying attention.
[02:38:48.030 --> 02:38:48.790]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:38:49.049 --> 02:38:52.889]  And one thing that's shocking to me is last year, it's just been reported, I think, in the last couple of weeks.
[02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:58.030]  Last year, one in 20 deaths in Canada, 15,000 deaths were attributed to euthanasia.
[02:38:58.430 --> 02:39:01.569]  And they did an ad campaign for their new euthanasia policy.
[02:39:02.380 --> 02:39:04.540]  Last year or the year before, maybe it was a couple of years ago.
[02:39:04.739 --> 02:39:12.540]  And this ad of this woman who clearly has terminal cancer is the most inspirational, beautiful ad that I have ever seen.
[02:39:12.659 --> 02:39:21.159]  It's got floating lanterns and a magical beach at dusk with all the people that she loves around her and this food and this celebration of life.
[02:39:21.459 --> 02:39:23.840]  And the whole ad is like, you wanna die?
[02:39:24.430 --> 02:39:25.549]  We'll take care of it.
[02:39:25.610 --> 02:39:28.629]  I mean, it's just so macabre to see it like that.
[02:39:28.930 --> 02:39:31.190]  And I mean, you're right on the money.
[02:39:31.309 --> 02:39:41.889]  And it's not even about intelligence either, because it's so easy to dismiss all these issues as half the population is stupid and half the population is above average and only a few of us are really smart.
[02:39:42.110 --> 02:39:57.180]  It's easy to dismiss this stupidity, but smart people are just as susceptible this to if they don't I mean, there are so many brilliant people that are Marxists and leftists and just totally in this cult.
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:01.920]  This great podcast episode with Sean Ryan came out recently with Rick Allen Ross.
[02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:07.620]  He's a cult expert and I disagree with a lot of what he says, but he is an expert on cults and his book on cults is very good.
[02:40:07.780 --> 02:40:20.159]  And he talks about how he has done interventions Trying to get people out of cults on behalf of their families for graduates of every Ivy League institution in the United States.
[02:40:20.319 --> 02:40:30.260]  So whether they were involved in Scientology or other cults that are less known, it has nothing to do with intelligence and it has everything to do with your level of consciousness and these methods and these systems that are employed.
[02:40:30.459 --> 02:40:39.559]  If these systems are employed on you, if you've got the best immune system in the world, it doesn't matter if you get injected with HIV. You're still gonna get AIDS and it's a problem.
[02:40:40.170 --> 02:40:41.950]  Doesn't matter how good your immune system is.
[02:40:41.950 --> 02:40:50.649]  If you have the highest IQ in the world, the best IQ in the world, if you're super smart, if these methods are put upon you unwittingly, you're gonna fall right to them.
[02:40:51.229 --> 02:40:53.049]  Yeah, so I guess what is the step?
[02:40:53.209 --> 02:40:58.329]  It's like you have to raise awareness in some sense because your mind's obviously not your soul, it's not consciousness, it's something else.
[02:40:58.350 --> 02:41:02.329]  And I think it's really easy to get stuck in an analytical space, right?
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:12.459]  It's almost to your detriment too if you are one of these higher IQ people because then you can use that as a fallacy as to like, no, I am exercising free will.
[02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:18.540]  I am smarter than you, so you need to be listening to me and I'm not going to listen to whatever you're countering.
[02:41:18.579 --> 02:41:25.200]  Yeah, I think that smarter people are almost more at risk because they can rationalize irrational things more efficiently.
[02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:27.120]  A perfect example of this is flat earthers.
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:29.459]  There's a lot of really smart people that are flat earthers.
[02:41:30.260 --> 02:41:31.500]  The earth is not flat.
[02:41:33.339 --> 02:41:41.559]  And I guarantee you right now, if I sat here and I had a debate with a flat earther, a sophisticated one, and I didn't have time to prepare, I would lose.
[02:41:42.020 --> 02:41:43.540]  Oh, I've been in that situation.
[02:41:45.299 --> 02:41:46.520]  I'm with Alex Stein.
[02:41:47.379 --> 02:41:48.260]  Oh, is he a flat earther?
[02:41:48.379 --> 02:41:49.639]  Yes, or at least he used to be.
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:51.000]  And he's a smart guy.
[02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:51.600]  He's very smart.
[02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:52.680]  He's not a dumb person at all.
[02:41:52.899 --> 02:41:53.360]  No, not at all.
[02:41:53.379 --> 02:41:55.020]  But smart people believe stupid shit all the time.
[02:41:55.139 --> 02:41:57.319]  And I'm like, I have no convincing argument.
[02:41:57.620 --> 02:41:58.780]  I just lost.
[02:41:59.100 --> 02:41:59.200]  Right.
[02:41:59.579 --> 02:42:03.879]  They get into stuff like, how can you explain the way the GPS performs at this point of the pole?
[02:42:03.959 --> 02:42:05.440]  I'm like, I don't know the explanation for that.
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:08.620]  At a certain point, I don't know.
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:21.219]  What needs to happen, and it is happening, I just hope it's happening fast enough, is trust in the establishment systems, whether it's government or legacy media, has to collapse.
[02:42:22.290 --> 02:42:23.649]  And we're seeing that happen.
[02:42:23.930 --> 02:42:30.069]  Nobody watches CNN. Nobody watches MSNBC. They're getting passed by the Hallmark Channel right now in ratings.
[02:42:30.329 --> 02:42:40.790]  And so we are seeing trust shifting from legacy controlled Project Mockingbird deep state media to alternative media, whether it's Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, Candace Horback, others.
[02:42:41.530 --> 02:42:42.489]  We're seeing that shift.
[02:42:42.649 --> 02:42:47.190]  And if enough people shift and wake up, then I think it will cure the problem.
[02:42:47.370 --> 02:42:55.489]  My concern is that the less power they have over the psychology of the population, that means they become increasingly desperate.
[02:42:55.510 --> 02:43:00.870]  And the more desperate they become, the more dangerous their behavior and unpredictable their behavior is.
[02:43:00.950 --> 02:43:03.489]  I'm really worried about what the deep state's going to do next year.
[02:43:04.149 --> 02:43:05.469]  That's an interesting thing.
[02:43:05.670 --> 02:43:10.290]  When you get back to the corner, you start biting, you start pulling hair, you're playing dirty, and that's where they're getting.
[02:43:10.549 --> 02:43:15.870]  Yeah, but maybe at some point it becomes an unwinnable match.
[02:43:16.350 --> 02:43:24.170]  If you have the people that are really united, and they're sovereign, and they're not easily manipulated, what are you going to do that is going to still benefit you?
[02:43:24.290 --> 02:43:27.489]  If you just drop nukes on everyone, then what, you're the king of the rubble?
[02:43:27.850 --> 02:43:38.670]  So at some point, even if they are acting out of desperation or biting or whatever, at some point they'll run out of options because they won't have anything that will be self-serving.
[02:43:38.790 --> 02:43:42.590]  Well, you just have to make opposition illegal at that point.
[02:43:43.239 --> 02:43:48.079]  And Gorbachev said this, I quoted this the other day on the show, he said, our power comes from the perception of our power.
[02:43:48.340 --> 02:43:58.379]  And every authoritarian government, whether it's Mao, whether it's Xi, whether it's Gorbachev, whether it's Hitler, they always have to make political opposition illegal.
[02:43:59.180 --> 02:44:09.920]  And they did things like eradicating any other parties other than the Nazi party or making it illegal to make certain claims or say certain things, creating incentive programs to rat out your neighbor for sabotaging.
[02:44:10.100 --> 02:44:20.840]  So you make it so that even if people aren't falling for your crap, you have so much control legally and militaristically and violently over them that it doesn't matter what they actually think.
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:28.190]  And then you can eventually, if you have a monopoly on all power and thought and communication, Really get them corralled.
[02:44:28.309 --> 02:44:34.610]  If you look at North Korea, most of that population, they're eating crickets because they're starving so badly.
[02:44:34.809 --> 02:44:36.329]  The suffering is just insane.
[02:44:36.629 --> 02:44:42.309]  People have their parents arrested for stealing food, and they go to hard labor camps for years.
[02:44:42.510 --> 02:44:47.809]  And the family is like, it's too bad that he stole, instead of being like, wait, the government shouldn't steal my dad for trying to feed us.
[02:44:47.950 --> 02:44:48.229]  You know what I mean?
[02:44:49.729 --> 02:44:59.729]  What they have to do is, when they can't trick us anymore, they have to make it illegal for us to hold them accountable in any way for the corruption that they used to.
[02:44:59.729 --> 02:45:12.340]  See, but I think that's the beautiful thing about America, because even though at times it can seem like it's losing its way or the people are losing its way, I still think the majority of Americans, We are rebels, right?
[02:45:12.559 --> 02:45:13.840]  You can't tell us what to do.
[02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:16.239]  And freedom and sovereignty are of the utmost importance.
[02:45:16.500 --> 02:45:18.860]  And it's live free or die.
[02:45:19.020 --> 02:45:20.600]  And I think that is most people.
[02:45:20.700 --> 02:45:26.459]  And I think that if it comes to that point, you're going to see really patriotic men and women that are going to fight for it.
[02:45:26.520 --> 02:45:29.239]  They're not just going to kowtow to whatever it is.
[02:45:30.409 --> 02:45:34.069]  Brett Weinstein brought up a point with the open borders specifically.
[02:45:34.530 --> 02:45:43.790]  Because when you talk about using the government or military to lock down or make political opposition illegal, I think most Americans wouldn't be on board with that.
[02:45:43.870 --> 02:45:45.709]  And they're like, okay, come and take it kind of mentality.
[02:45:46.030 --> 02:45:55.829]  But if you have an open border and you have all of these people that aren't naturalized and don't have our shared values and principles, and they will do whatever they're told to in order to reap the benefits of staying here.
[02:45:56.030 --> 02:46:03.610]  Well, now you have all of these people coming in through South America that will listen if there's a martial law, and they will turn- Sure, cuz it's still better than where they came from.
[02:46:03.790 --> 02:46:05.290]  Exactly, and they don't have legions.
[02:46:05.629 --> 02:46:11.909]  They will see us as other, so it'll be a lot easier to weaponize them than it would an American soldier.
[02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:13.940]  Yeah, it's really a Trojan horse.
[02:46:14.399 --> 02:46:18.600]  And then you can even say that's part of the COVID shot as well, right?
[02:46:18.659 --> 02:46:22.000]  Because you had a lot of the American military that were like, I'm not doing this.
[02:46:22.079 --> 02:46:24.299]  So you're getting rid of good, capable men and women.
[02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:25.700]  For what reason?
[02:46:25.700 --> 02:46:29.620]  To make room for other people that are gonna listen because they have self-interest.
[02:46:30.459 --> 02:46:30.860]  Absolutely.
[02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:37.879]  I totally agree with what you're saying about our inherent American culture of rebellion.
[02:46:51.409 --> 02:46:55.190]  A small, they said 3%, maybe it was 15%.
[02:46:55.190 --> 02:47:00.510]  There's been disputes on whether or not in the Revolutionary War, what percentage of the population actually supported it.
[02:47:00.629 --> 02:47:01.729]  But it was definitely a minority.
[02:47:02.049 --> 02:47:08.069]  And an activated minority is much more powerful than Yeah.
[02:47:34.540 --> 02:47:35.940]  Yeah.
[02:47:38.700 --> 02:47:40.100]  Yeah.
[02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:47.319]  Yeah.
[02:47:51.079 --> 02:47:51.379]  Mm-hm.
[02:47:51.860 --> 02:47:56.940]  And it just takes people caring and wanting to spend even a tiny amount of energy.
[02:47:57.079 --> 02:48:03.540]  Because so many people, they're just so lost in this kind of complacent robotic place where they just want to exist.
[02:48:03.879 --> 02:48:03.959]  Yeah.
[02:48:04.059 --> 02:48:07.420]  And they don't want any struggle and they don't want, it's not my problem.
[02:48:07.659 --> 02:48:11.760]  And when I run into people that say, I'm not into politics.
[02:48:12.079 --> 02:48:13.000]  What do you mean?
[02:48:13.219 --> 02:48:14.620]  What do you mean you're not into politics?
[02:48:14.799 --> 02:48:19.540]  Because it downstream affects everything else, even if you are unaware of it.
[02:48:19.659 --> 02:48:20.739]  It's your responsibility.
[02:48:20.850 --> 02:48:23.270]  If you're not interested in politics, politics is still interested in you.
[02:48:23.389 --> 02:48:23.690]  Exactly.
[02:48:24.129 --> 02:48:28.209]  Yeah, so it is your duty to spend a little bit of attention on it.
[02:48:28.329 --> 02:48:28.530]  You know what I mean?
[02:48:28.610 --> 02:48:29.049]  100%.
[02:48:29.049 --> 02:48:44.030]  Well, and the beauty of America is that for so many years, for such a long time, our federal government was so restrained and contained by the Constitution that it wasn't as relevant what the federal government did, what laws they passed.
[02:48:44.409 --> 02:48:46.530]  You didn't feel it immediately as a citizen.
[02:48:47.649 --> 02:48:50.389]  In the economy, in your home, in your life.
[02:48:50.590 --> 02:48:58.649]  And so people just got to a place where they didn't need to pay attention to it or they felt they didn't need to pay attention to it because it was a free society.
[02:48:58.889 --> 02:49:06.569]  Now we've reached a place where the corruption is felt at every aspect facet of our society.
[02:49:09.229 --> 02:49:18.870]  Whether you're interested in politics or not, there's no denying that under this Biden administration, for example, when you go to the grocery store, you're coming out with less than is on your list because the prices are insane.
[02:49:19.270 --> 02:49:21.489]  You're not filling up your gas tank all the way.
[02:49:21.610 --> 02:49:25.989]  You're filling it up a quarter or half a tank at a time because you're trying to save cash until the next paycheck and you got other bills.
[02:49:26.250 --> 02:49:37.530]  You know that the healthcare premiums are through the roof and that even though you have health insurance that you're paying $1,000 a month for, somebody's paying $1,000 a month for, you still owe the hospital $30,000 for the baby that you just had.
[02:49:37.750 --> 02:49:39.899]  I was gonna say, that's how much Yeah, it's insane.
[02:49:40.239 --> 02:49:48.040]  And once that level of corruption and power from the federal government becomes to the level that it is, that's why you see a populist awakening.
[02:49:48.340 --> 02:49:58.879]  And the question is whether or not the pace of the awakening is faster than the pace of the hijacking of people.
[02:49:59.520 --> 02:50:00.940]  The country by the deep state.
[02:50:01.399 --> 02:50:09.159]  That's what I don't know the answer to and I just hope for and fight for, is that we can wake people up faster than they can shut freedom down.
[02:50:09.579 --> 02:50:11.700]  Well, pain is a powerful motivator, right?
[02:50:11.899 --> 02:50:18.819]  So it's almost that the things that they're doing for themselves is actually gonna be the thing that comes back to bite them in the butt.
[02:50:19.020 --> 02:50:23.059]  So when people can't afford their groceries, to have a baby, all of that, right?
[02:50:23.260 --> 02:50:24.600]  They're gonna say something's not working.
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:25.420]  Absolutely.
[02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:27.219]  Candace, it's been an honor and pleasure to have you.
[02:50:27.340 --> 02:50:30.899]  Please follow her on X, at Candace Horback, and come back and join us again.
[02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:31.680]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:50:31.879 --> 02:50:32.040]  Thanks.
[02:50:39.969 --> 02:50:41.530]  We are exposing the globalists.
[02:50:41.649 --> 02:50:44.569]  We are reaching 60, 70, 80 million people a day.
[02:50:44.709 --> 02:50:46.409]  We're back in the Infowar studios.
[02:50:46.729 --> 02:50:48.809]  The purchase was fraudulent.
[02:50:48.950 --> 02:50:51.290]  There's emergency hearings in court coming up next week.
[02:50:51.409 --> 02:50:57.149]  But regardless, I'm going to stay on air at the Alex Jones Network, even if this shuts down.
[02:50:57.329 --> 02:51:02.590]  So when you go to our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com, that's not owned by me.
[02:51:03.170 --> 02:51:11.270]  The Onion people and the National Gun Control Crew and the Democrats, even if they succeed, which I don't believe they will, will not get the AlexJonesStore.com.
[02:51:11.270 --> 02:51:14.670]  They will not get the Alex Jones Network because I don't own it.
[02:51:14.870 --> 02:51:22.850]  So when you support our sponsor, the AlexJonesStore.com, with some of the most incredible supplements ever, the superfood, Irish Sea Moss.
[02:51:23.129 --> 02:51:26.290]  We have the strongest, most concentrated, incredible for your whole body.
[02:51:26.510 --> 02:51:27.809]  Take an hour to go through it all.
[02:51:27.989 --> 02:51:28.790]  Go check it out.
[02:51:29.030 --> 02:51:30.909]  That's there discounted up to $50.
[02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:35.709]  55% when you get three bottles, 50% when you get one bottle, 40% when you get one bottle.
[02:51:35.889 --> 02:51:36.430]  Try it.
[02:51:36.469 --> 02:51:37.090]  You're gonna love it.
[02:51:37.170 --> 02:51:37.610]  I'm on it.
[02:51:37.690 --> 02:51:38.489]  I've lost so much weight.
[02:51:38.750 --> 02:51:39.450]  It's insane.
[02:51:39.569 --> 02:51:40.590]  Get that and other supplements.
[02:51:40.729 --> 02:51:45.250]  And then, there's over 200 designs of t-shirts, ball caps, and hoodies now there.
[02:51:45.489 --> 02:51:51.770]  These folks that own it bigly were already one of the Top producers of Trump and Patriot gear.
[02:51:51.889 --> 02:51:52.709]  They have the best designs.
[02:51:53.129 --> 02:51:54.850]  All of the new Trump One gear.
[02:51:54.930 --> 02:51:57.329]  There's more than 40 shirts and hoodies and ball caps there.
[02:51:57.709 --> 02:51:58.969]  These designs are incredible.
[02:51:59.149 --> 02:52:05.389]  And now there's all these amazing Alex Jones shirts that are limited edition and will keep me on the air one way or another.
[02:52:05.549 --> 02:52:06.149]  Here they are.
[02:52:06.319 --> 02:52:07.100]  Look at this one.
[02:52:07.260 --> 02:52:11.159]  That famous meme of me coming out of the tunnel with all the Alex Jones clones.
[02:52:11.420 --> 02:52:13.180]  We are all Alex Jones.
[02:52:13.340 --> 02:52:14.360]  You've got to get that.
[02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:16.700]  Gay frogs equals extinction.
[02:52:16.979 --> 02:52:17.620]  Oh my goodness.
[02:52:18.040 --> 02:52:20.120]  What a way to wake folks up about all the poison in the water.
[02:52:20.219 --> 02:52:21.239]  That's now mainstream news.
[02:52:21.760 --> 02:52:24.639]  1984 is not an instruction manual.
[02:52:25.100 --> 02:52:26.139]  Team humanity.
[02:52:26.459 --> 02:52:27.920]  Oh my gosh, that is amazing.
[02:52:28.059 --> 02:52:30.260]  Launched that over a year ago with Elon Musk.
[02:52:30.459 --> 02:52:32.200]  And then, Dale Grebel.
[02:52:32.639 --> 02:52:37.819]  Oh, warns you about the government was right the whole time.
[02:52:38.219 --> 02:52:39.159]  Darkest Hour.
[02:52:39.420 --> 02:52:40.620]  Me is Winston Churchill.
[02:52:41.200 --> 02:52:45.739]  And so much more at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[02:52:45.819 --> 02:52:47.920]  Now, we don't make a ton off the t-shirts.
[02:52:48.440 --> 02:52:53.260]  We don't make a ton off the supplements because there's not a lot of markup in those, but we do sell a lot.
[02:52:53.399 --> 02:53:03.139]  But where we do get major funds is the marked up classic Alex Jones Infowars red on navy blue shirt and a few other fundraiser shirts that aren't 25 or 30 bucks.
[02:53:03.319 --> 02:53:05.899]  They're 50, so we get real money in.
[02:53:05.959 --> 02:53:09.620]  Because these t-shirts are high quality, printed right here in Arkansas in the United States.
[02:53:10.130 --> 02:53:13.610]  And so, extra, extra, extra large is like 16, 17 bucks.
[02:53:13.729 --> 02:53:16.030]  A small is like 15. The printing costs money.
[02:53:16.209 --> 02:53:17.450]  The sponsor gets part of the money.
[02:53:17.549 --> 02:53:18.770]  We get part of it to operate.
[02:53:19.450 --> 02:53:21.969]  We're making like six, seven bucks on the average t-shirt, which is great.
[02:53:22.110 --> 02:53:22.969]  And they spread the word.
[02:53:23.049 --> 02:53:23.729]  You meet like-minded people.
[02:53:23.829 --> 02:53:30.129]  But when you get the marked up shirts, only two of them are marked up to 50, we get some real money in to the operation.
[02:53:30.190 --> 02:53:33.370]  So if you really want to support, get the fundraiser shirts.
[02:53:33.770 --> 02:53:44.370]  Also, The posters, limited edition, back-to-back-to-back Trump win, all those are marked up where they cost us six, seven bucks to print them and to put it in the tube.
[02:53:44.590 --> 02:53:46.969]  So we make like 40-something bucks off that.
[02:53:47.110 --> 02:53:57.270]  If you really want to support us and hang it on the wall and know you supported the second American Revolution right at the critical point, then get some of the limited edition posters as well.
[02:53:57.409 --> 02:53:59.250]  But regardless, you're going to love the supplements.
[02:53:59.450 --> 02:54:00.709]  You're going to want to order again.
[02:54:00.950 --> 02:54:03.090]  We can't stay on air without your support.
[02:54:03.450 --> 02:54:04.590]  I'm suing the deep state.
[02:54:04.729 --> 02:54:05.530]  We're going after them.
[02:54:05.670 --> 02:54:11.670]  We have put all the stuff they did and the bid rigging and everything in these lawsuits and court filings.
[02:54:11.969 --> 02:54:13.129]  We're going to win this thing.
[02:54:13.250 --> 02:54:16.870]  But regardless, we've got to have money to continue to fight them and stay on air.
[02:54:17.010 --> 02:54:26.489]  So go now to thealexjonesstore.com for amazing products and know you stood with fellow Americans at the critical time to save our republic.
[02:54:27.809 --> 02:54:30.450]  Thealexjonesstore.com Thank you so much for your support.
[02:54:33.420 --> 02:54:36.440]  ...is the temperature increasing or decreasing.
[02:54:37.180 --> 02:54:39.020]  It's always doing one or the other.
[02:54:39.379 --> 02:54:41.500]  I have no concern about that.
[02:54:42.100 --> 02:54:49.920]  By asking people to worry about whether it's going up or down, you're immediately establishing dishonesty.
[02:54:50.559 --> 02:54:52.440]  The Earth is always changing.
[02:54:52.620 --> 02:54:55.159]  Climate change is nothing you have to prove.
[02:54:56.139 --> 02:54:57.840]  It always is happening.
[02:54:58.120 --> 02:54:59.579]  It always has happened.
[02:55:00.639 --> 02:55:05.540]  So to make that into something alarming seems to me a little bit weird.
[02:55:07.889 --> 02:55:10.729]  Sea level is a hard thing to measure, actually.
[02:55:11.370 --> 02:55:17.489]  At any given place, traditionally, sea level was measured by what are called tide gauges.
[02:55:17.690 --> 02:55:19.629]  They're a stick in the water, basically.
[02:55:20.270 --> 02:55:24.069]  And two things change what a tide gauge shows.
[02:55:24.229 --> 02:55:28.590]  The land moving up and down, and the sea moving up and down.
[02:55:28.969 --> 02:55:32.510]  Most places, it's the land that is the biggest effect.
[02:55:32.889 --> 02:55:36.049]  So you don't have a good measure of sea level rise.
[02:55:37.979 --> 02:55:45.319]  On the other hand, for the last 30 years or so, we've had satellite measurements that are actually measuring sea level.
[02:55:47.260 --> 02:55:50.340]  It's very hard to relate these two measurements to each other.
[02:55:50.459 --> 02:55:51.799]  They were measuring different things.
[02:55:52.860 --> 02:56:02.079]  The general feeling is there is no evidence that it's different now than it has been for the last few thousand years.
[02:56:02.340 --> 02:56:10.780]  It's been slowly rising ever since the initial rapid rise after the deglaciation 12,000 years ago.
[02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:24.819]  The claim that we've suddenly seen a big change in that given we've changed the instrumentation and given the error bars cover the difference Is not entirely fair.
[02:56:25.420 --> 02:56:34.739]  And to suggest that what's been going on for thousands of years is something we should suddenly be alarmed at also doesn't seem reasonable.
[02:56:35.139 --> 02:56:43.959]  When you hear a Ban Ki-moon saying, life as we know it will cease if we don't do something, what is he referring to?
[02:56:45.780 --> 02:56:46.940]  I don't know.
[02:56:48.639 --> 02:56:50.360]  I mean, man is adaptable.
[02:56:51.659 --> 02:56:57.700]  People retire to the Sun Belt, not to the Northwest Territory of Canada.
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:04.959]  Although catastrophes certainly occur, they have many causes of which global warming is one of the least.
[02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:08.260]  There are so many interesting questions in climate.
[02:57:08.639 --> 02:57:13.780]  We still do not have a complete handle on why we had ice ages.
[02:57:15.799 --> 02:57:23.399]  Now, you know, if you want to be concerned, you want a disaster, having two miles of ice on your head is problematic.
[02:57:23.959 --> 02:57:25.280]  And the earth has had that.
[02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:30.959]  It's very much a matter of the unchallengeable assertion.
[02:57:31.100 --> 02:57:32.739]  All religions have dogmas.
[02:57:34.369 --> 02:57:39.409]  Dogmas are not proven statements or assertions that cannot be challenged.
[02:57:39.729 --> 02:57:41.090]  It doesn't mean they're false.
[02:57:41.489 --> 02:57:43.409]  I mean, I'm not even suggesting that.
[02:57:43.750 --> 02:57:50.409]  I'm simply suggesting that it's a bad idea to have anything that can't be challenged.
[02:57:50.729 --> 02:57:55.530]  And the trouble is, all of us scientists are government employees.
[02:57:56.170 --> 02:58:03.170]  Even if we're working for private universities, all research is supported by the government.
[02:58:03.659 --> 02:58:09.760]  So, as such, we're very sensitive to what politicians say and believe.
[02:58:10.399 --> 02:58:11.700]  That's a shortcoming.
[02:58:12.020 --> 02:58:23.579]  You have to figure out how to fund science in a way that there are no incentives to artificially promoting things.
[02:58:23.879 --> 02:58:32.540]  You know, when you hear, for instance, a scientist saying, the science is settled, you know that person has stepped out of the science.
[02:58:35.730 --> 02:58:39.030]  I think that registers with ordinary people.
[02:58:39.750 --> 02:58:50.100]  And whenever you see someone say, instead of answering arguments, How could so many people agree if it weren't true?
[02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:52.540]  This should be a red flag.
[02:58:52.739 --> 02:59:03.459]  My view is one has conflated the trivial, which is that temperature is changing, climate is changing, man plays some role.
[02:59:03.840 --> 02:59:09.420]  There's not much disagreement with predictions of disaster.
[02:59:10.920 --> 02:59:18.040]  That are not connected clearly to warming or to our activities or to anything else.
[02:59:19.059 --> 02:59:25.299]  And leaving people with the thought that if the first part is true, the second part must be true.
[02:59:25.520 --> 02:59:30.760]  The only thing that turns the tide is when the levy breaks.
[02:59:33.440 --> 02:59:37.940]  You saw in the last segment of time lapse of coastlines over the course of the last 30 years, everything's the same.
[02:59:39.309 --> 02:59:45.670]  I had a clip on the list yesterday of John Kerry predicting that by 2014 we were gonna have an ice-free Arctic summer.
[02:59:46.129 --> 02:59:46.610]  Never happened.
[02:59:47.489 --> 02:59:52.790]  Countless examples of Al Gore lying about catastrophe after catastrophe and projection after projection.
[02:59:52.930 --> 02:59:56.889]  I mean, Al Gore is wrong and has been wrong as often as Alex Jones has been right.
[02:59:58.489 --> 03:00:01.549]  Which is remarkable, to say the least.
[03:00:03.639 --> 03:00:08.600]  And now we've got these drones flying all over the tri-state area, and we've got these rumors about what they are.
[03:00:08.700 --> 03:00:09.399]  Are they aliens?
[03:00:09.500 --> 03:00:10.239]  Is there a dirty bomb?
[03:00:10.340 --> 03:00:10.959]  Is there a nuke bomb?
[03:00:10.959 --> 03:00:11.819]  Is there a false flag?
[03:00:11.959 --> 03:00:13.280]  Is it going to be Project Bluebeam?
[03:00:13.360 --> 03:00:14.299]  What is going on?
[03:00:14.360 --> 03:00:25.280]  Is this about legislation to eradicate consumer-level drones because they're going to try to bring martial law and a civil war in place, and they don't want us to have access to technology that can compromise their mission to sabotage the entire country?
[03:00:28.459 --> 03:00:32.579]  Alarm after alarm after alarm, or there's Project 2025, whether it's climate change.
[03:00:34.090 --> 03:00:42.090]  Whether it's World War III, whether it's Russia, whether it's Gaza, whether it's China taking over Taiwan, it's alarm after alarm after alarm.
[03:00:43.190 --> 03:00:58.329]  And it's all a distraction because while the mainstream media forces us to speculate about disaster after disaster, while academia and these institutions force us to consider hypothetical catastrophes that only they can solve,
[03:00:58.489 --> 03:01:03.090]  problems only they can solve, solutions only they have, expansion only they can do.
[03:01:04.489 --> 03:01:11.229]  While they force us to consider all of these things that may or may not ever come to pass are likely just made up lies by the deep state.
[03:01:12.430 --> 03:01:16.809]  We are distracted from paying attention to the thing that they are going to do right now.
[03:01:17.450 --> 03:01:22.209]  The 1500 pages of legislation and the omnibus bill that they are going to pass right now.
[03:01:22.729 --> 03:01:32.750]  So instead of paying attention to the corruption and the evil that is definitely, explicitly, directly taking place right before our eyes.
[03:01:34.350 --> 03:01:39.510]  We're constantly distracted by scandals that aren't really scandals, by issues that aren't really issues.
[03:01:41.450 --> 03:01:43.309]  Disasters that have not yet come to pass.
[03:01:45.399 --> 03:01:48.120]  It's part of a psychological operation.
[03:01:48.340 --> 03:02:06.520]  We spend our time here on Infowars, the Alex Jones show and the other shows, the other hosts do a great job analyzing the psychological operations of the deep state, the lies of the mainstream media and the corruption of the political class because our mission is to wake up a populist because an awakened populist cannot be manipulated,
[03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:07.799]  controlled.
[03:02:09.770 --> 03:02:13.129]  They cannot become a programmable, non-player character.
[03:02:13.270 --> 03:02:22.629]  And we know intuitively that this is a major threat to humanity because we see it in our art, in our literature, in our cinema, back when cinema was actually cinema.
[03:02:23.069 --> 03:02:24.790]  I mean, that's the whole theme of The Matrix.
[03:02:24.950 --> 03:02:30.889]  That's why this motif of The Matrix has come up over and over again, whether from Elon Musk, Andrew Tate, or others.
[03:02:32.850 --> 03:02:50.149]  We understand that the greatest threat to humanity It is a population that is not even aware that they are wired into the Matrix while their entire soul, being, and life is being hijacked and farmed by a political establishment.
[03:02:50.149 --> 03:03:08.010]  In the Matrix, the artificial intelligence antagonist, villain, Was literally farming and mining the very life force of the entire species of humanity while they were unaware in a matrix,
[03:03:08.389 --> 03:03:12.790]  programmed in to an infrastructure, to a simulation that was not real.
[03:03:12.909 --> 03:03:21.750]  And though they felt some semblance of emptiness and lack of fulfillment in this matrix, they were able to dismiss it and tolerate it because of the nature of the system.
[03:03:23.530 --> 03:03:28.649]  And so this movie, although it's a science fiction and it's not literally happening, is metaphorically happening.
[03:03:28.770 --> 03:03:29.950]  That is a true story.
[03:03:30.270 --> 03:03:32.350]  The Matrix is a lie that tells the truth.
[03:03:32.590 --> 03:03:34.250]  It's a fiction that tells the truth.
[03:03:35.329 --> 03:03:38.670]  It was Nathaniel Hawthorne that originally said fiction is a lie that tells the truth.
[03:03:42.870 --> 03:03:46.670]  And so the only way to solve the problem is to get people out of the Matrix.
[03:03:47.989 --> 03:04:04.299]  The only way to solve the problem is to enlighten people As to the true objective nature of reality and pull them out, even though the simulation is more comfortable, more pleasant, and safer than the harsh reality of a dystopian future,
[03:04:04.920 --> 03:04:14.399]  a harsh reality is so much more desirable and necessary than a safe and comfortable lie.
[03:04:15.559 --> 03:04:18.780]  It says in the Bible you're not supposed to lie, you're not supposed to bear false witness.
[03:04:19.370 --> 03:04:23.450]  It's because every lie incurs a debt.
[03:04:23.829 --> 03:04:27.829]  Every lie that we tell as individuals incurs a debt and eventually you pay for it.
[03:04:28.190 --> 03:04:30.969]  Pay for it with more lies and then you get more lie debt.
[03:04:31.409 --> 03:04:34.569]  Eventually you go bankrupt and no one ever trusts you again.
[03:04:34.729 --> 03:04:36.090]  That's what our political class has done.
[03:04:36.270 --> 03:04:37.110]  They've lied.
[03:04:38.059 --> 03:04:41.940]  Over the years, and the more they've lied, the more they've had to lie, and now no one trusts them at all.
[03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:43.459]  And trust is the currency of leadership.
[03:04:43.719 --> 03:04:45.500]  That's why the mainstream media is collapsing.
[03:04:45.639 --> 03:04:52.819]  It's why the political class is collapsing right before our eyes, because they have exhausted all of their ability to expand their line of credit in truth versus lies.
[03:04:54.780 --> 03:05:01.040]  And they can't lie fast enough to catch up to the debt that they owe society in terms of trust.
[03:05:04.170 --> 03:05:06.590]  So when your money's a lie, it means war all the time.
[03:05:06.790 --> 03:05:09.110]  When these disasters are a lie, it means corruption all the time.
[03:05:09.370 --> 03:05:12.629]  When the legislation is a lie, it means the infringement of our freedoms.
[03:05:13.209 --> 03:05:22.350]  You have to transcend the matrix, get out of the matrix, exit the matrix, and fight the enemy in a harsh and uncomfortable reality in order to dismantle it.
[03:05:22.430 --> 03:05:25.110]  And you have to wake enough people up to do it.
[03:05:25.170 --> 03:05:26.209]  It doesn't have to be the majority of people.
[03:05:26.850 --> 03:05:32.450]  It just has to be an activated, intelligent, intentional minority.
[03:05:33.399 --> 03:05:35.280]  Working to save humanity.
[03:05:37.299 --> 03:05:39.799]  Because it's the right thing to do.
[03:05:42.319 --> 03:05:44.819]  And I know as human beings, we're inherently selfish.
[03:05:45.219 --> 03:05:48.559]  We're inherently narcissistic, egotistical.
[03:05:49.379 --> 03:06:00.440]  And we only have one life, so there's not a lot of incentive for us to care about the state of humanity long into the future.
[03:06:03.489 --> 03:06:13.309]  Our predisposition is to live selfishly, hedonistically for ourselves and let the world burn around us because we're not going to be here when it all goes away.
[03:06:14.569 --> 03:06:18.989]  We're not going to be here when World War III happens, World War IV happens, World War V happens, we don't think.
[03:06:19.750 --> 03:06:24.610]  We're not going to be here when the entire economy of the world collapses because our currency is a lie.
[03:06:24.729 --> 03:06:26.409]  So who cares if we expand the debt?
[03:06:26.510 --> 03:06:27.610]  Who cares whatsoever?
[03:06:29.459 --> 03:06:30.719]  That's the predisposition.
[03:06:30.920 --> 03:06:50.219]  But once you become in touch with your humanity, once you become truly in touch with the human condition, and you realize that living that way is simply not enough, though it may seem satisfying on the front, then you begin to see a macro mission.
[03:06:51.559 --> 03:06:54.360]  You begin to see a greater calling.
[03:06:55.180 --> 03:06:58.680]  And it will require great sacrifices of you.
[03:06:59.659 --> 03:07:00.760]  It will make you uncomfortable.
[03:07:01.059 --> 03:07:02.340]  You will lose relationships.
[03:07:02.440 --> 03:07:04.079]  You may make less money.
[03:07:04.239 --> 03:07:05.639]  You may struggle more often.
[03:07:06.020 --> 03:07:10.239]  You may be riddled with doubt and more vulnerable and exposed.
[03:07:12.719 --> 03:07:14.899]  But you'll have something that you never had before.
[03:07:15.139 --> 03:07:17.840]  You'll have a sense of fulfillment and a clean conscience.
[03:07:18.700 --> 03:07:29.739]  Now I know one or two out of 100 people in the world is technically a sociopath, clinically sociopathic, clinically incapable of feeling empathy, guilt, or remorse.
[03:07:29.860 --> 03:07:30.920]  I'm not talking about those people.
[03:07:31.079 --> 03:07:32.899]  I'm talking about humanity as a whole.
[03:07:33.040 --> 03:07:42.860]  I believe that people are inherently good, and they're just having a hell of a time figuring out what it means to be good and summoning the fortitude to actually live according to those values.
[03:07:43.889 --> 03:07:51.790]  They're having a hard time circumscribing their desires and then acting justly according to that moral compass.
[03:07:57.469 --> 03:08:01.510]  And so let me give you a little bit of a red pill right now if you want to get out of the matrix.
[03:08:04.430 --> 03:08:10.540]  Let me draw your attention away from Drones and Bluebeam and aliens.
[03:08:10.760 --> 03:08:16.020]  Let me draw your attention away from Luigi Mangione and CEOs being assassinated.
[03:08:16.139 --> 03:08:24.200]  Let me draw your attention away from Russian leaders being assassinated in Moscow with Ukraine backing.
[03:08:24.299 --> 03:08:29.379]  Let me draw your attention away from CIA enemies of the state list in Ukraine that have your name on them.
[03:08:29.500 --> 03:08:31.879]  Let me draw your attention away from climate change.
[03:08:32.100 --> 03:08:40.299]  Let me draw your attention away from World War III. And let me draw your attention right here, this red pill, to the Nebuchadnezzar.
[03:08:41.059 --> 03:08:43.959]  To the harsh reality of what is going on.
[03:08:44.040 --> 03:08:46.059]  This 1500 page bill.
[03:08:47.040 --> 03:09:04.500]  That is another utilitarian example of compromise at the expense of the interests of the American people that will manifest in a very real and practical way that will inhibit the next administration from being able to accomplish anything good so that the deep state can keep all of humanity in a controlled simulation.
[03:09:05.739 --> 03:09:10.879]  Vivek Ramaswamy came out with a long statement, but it's so good that I'm going to read it to you.
[03:09:11.719 --> 03:09:28.729]  He says, Thank you.
[03:09:30.690 --> 03:10:02.389]  He goes on to say, We're
[03:10:02.389 --> 03:10:07.790]  good to go.
[03:10:23.340 --> 03:10:26.899]  Congress has known about this deadline since they created it in late September.
[03:10:26.899 --> 03:10:34.739]  There's no reason why this couldn't have gone through the standard process instead of being rushed to a vote right before congressmen want to go home for the holidays.
[03:10:35.399 --> 03:10:40.920]  The urgency is 100% manufactured and designed to avoid serious public debate.
[03:10:42.180 --> 03:10:45.540]  Vivek goes on to say the bill could have easily been under 20 pages.
[03:10:45.659 --> 03:10:52.020]  Instead, there are dozens of unrelated policy items crammed into the 1,547 pages of this bill.
[03:11:18.490 --> 03:11:22.510]  We're good to go.
[03:11:24.229 --> 03:11:27.469]  Finally, he says, we're grateful for Doge's warm reception on Capitol Hill.
[03:11:27.670 --> 03:11:28.850]  Nearly everyone agrees.
[03:11:29.090 --> 03:11:33.750]  We need a smaller and more streamlined federal government, but actions speak louder than words.
[03:11:33.989 --> 03:11:35.649]  This is an early test.
[03:11:35.950 --> 03:11:37.250]  The bill should fail.
[03:11:38.450 --> 03:11:46.709]  Tom Renn says, breaking congressional spending bill is a big pharma gift, extending and expanding COVID emergency powers to other pandemics, and even reiterating mRNA vaccine immunity.
[03:11:49.629 --> 03:11:51.209]  More details to come out as well.
[03:11:51.729 --> 03:11:59.729]  Elon Musk says absolutely to Representative Eric Burleson saying this omnibus is the very thing the incoming Department of Government Efficiency is trying to put an end to.
[03:12:00.170 --> 03:12:02.430]  A vote for this monstrosity is a vote against Doge.
[03:12:02.530 --> 03:12:06.629]  I saw a clip on Mike Collins' ex-account last night.
[03:12:06.809 --> 03:12:10.770]  He just posted an image of the bill, stacked, printed all 1,500 pages.
[03:12:11.250 --> 03:12:12.350]  Maybe the crew can find it.
[03:12:12.889 --> 03:12:17.350]  Representative Mike Collins, he posted it from his Representative Mike Collins account, not his personal account.
[03:12:17.489 --> 03:12:23.850]  And I know Mike Mike was kind enough to come on my podcast when he was running for Congress.
[03:12:23.850 --> 03:12:26.489]  I believe he's in Georgia, though I could be mistaken.
[03:12:27.959 --> 03:12:29.420]  And I've spoken to him privately.
[03:12:29.420 --> 03:12:31.899]  I've spoken to him publicly and in streams.
[03:12:32.639 --> 03:12:33.719]  He's somebody that I trust.
[03:12:34.139 --> 03:12:37.600]  He's an average, hardworking, small business-owning, successful American.
[03:12:37.860 --> 03:12:40.540]  And he ran because he was sick of all the crap coming from the government.
[03:12:40.840 --> 03:12:45.100]  He's got no reason to run other than that he wants to affect positive change.
[03:12:45.399 --> 03:12:46.840]  He showed me the stack of this bill.
[03:12:47.120 --> 03:12:52.280]  And my first thought was, well, you obviously need the PDF of that so you can have ChatGPT scan it and tell you everything that's in it.
[03:12:53.430 --> 03:12:56.190]  But it's just like what they did with the Affordable Care Act.
[03:12:56.190 --> 03:12:57.850]  It's just like what they did with the Patriot Act.
[03:12:58.010 --> 03:13:00.889]  It's just like what they do all the time with all pieces of legislation.
[03:13:01.129 --> 03:13:10.750]  They hammer everything into it that's corrupt and then they name it something or they say it's for farmers so that if you oppose any of the other issues in the bill, it's because you hate farmers.
[03:13:14.459 --> 03:13:25.139]  Okay, so we're gonna create a bill, for example, that is going to increase funding for cancer research aimed at helping children who are diagnosed with leukemia.
[03:13:25.799 --> 03:13:27.780]  That's gonna be one thing that this bill does.
[03:13:28.940 --> 03:13:31.180]  But we're also going to give a billion dollars to Ukraine.
[03:13:31.280 --> 03:13:33.399]  Then we're also going to give a billion dollars to Israel.
[03:13:33.399 --> 03:13:35.239]  And we're also going to give a billion dollars to Iran.
[03:13:35.360 --> 03:13:39.079]  We're also going to fund terrorist organizations all over the world.
[03:13:39.139 --> 03:13:46.780]  And we're also going to pay for studies in India on whether brown mice or white mice prefer to eat peanuts or cashews.
[03:13:48.829 --> 03:13:52.389]  We're also going to build a stadium in Washington, D.C. We're also going to give ourselves raises.
[03:13:52.690 --> 03:13:56.590]  And then when you come out and pose and say, why are we funding this study in India?
[03:13:57.549 --> 03:14:03.090]  You're determining whether white mice or brown mice prefer cashews or peanuts.
[03:14:03.430 --> 03:14:07.190]  They say, oh, you want kids to die of leukemia?
[03:14:07.870 --> 03:14:09.909]  Oh, you want kids to die of cancer?
[03:14:10.030 --> 03:14:18.350]  I mean, this is the psychological manipulation of just the most evil, grotesque, malignant tumors of our civilization.
[03:14:19.740 --> 03:14:22.360]  And it only works on people who are not awake.
[03:14:22.520 --> 03:14:31.819]  It only works on people who are still in the matrix, who are distracted by the simulation, who prefer the comfort of the blue pill rather than the fulfillment of the red pill.
[03:14:32.659 --> 03:14:35.760]  Or have just resigned to the black pill and decided there's nothing we can do about it.
[03:14:35.799 --> 03:14:37.200]  There is nothing we can do about it.
[03:14:37.319 --> 03:14:53.950]  All we have to do is wake up because when they lie to you like that, and when they say to you that, oh, you're opposing this bill because you hate farmers, It only works on the segment of the population that is not awake, that is not aware that they're in the Matrix, that has not transcended and left the Matrix.
[03:14:57.190 --> 03:14:59.889]  You see scenes from the Matrix of the code flying down the screens.
[03:15:00.030 --> 03:15:01.129]  There's even a clip about it, actually.
[03:15:01.290 --> 03:15:11.170]  Let's find the clip from the Matrix where Neo is talking to, what's his name, Cypher, and they have the drink together looking at the screen.
[03:15:11.850 --> 03:15:17.649]  You can see the code falling down And it's hard to interpret.
[03:15:19.569 --> 03:15:30.110]  It's too complicated to interpret the code unless you're really paying attention, unless you transcend it and understand how to manipulate it and make yourself immune from it.
[03:15:31.729 --> 03:15:35.290]  And that's what We at Infowars are here doing.
[03:15:35.409 --> 03:15:36.250]  That's what our mission is.
[03:15:36.350 --> 03:15:44.770]  Our mission is to study the code that is the matrix, to transcend it, to look at it from the outside, not be subjected to it from the inside.
[03:15:45.209 --> 03:15:47.530]  Study it, and then use it against itself.
[03:15:47.909 --> 03:16:01.850]  Spin it back in, inform and awaken as many assets within the matrix as possible to bring them out so that they can not be controlled by it, but transcend it and render it moot.
[03:16:04.540 --> 03:16:09.219]  And I don't know if it's gonna be next year or 100 years from now or 300 years from now.
[03:16:09.299 --> 03:16:10.159]  It's probably gonna be soon.
[03:16:11.440 --> 03:16:21.700]  But eventually, this approach will cause the collapse of the United States of America and could be an existential threat to humanity itself.
[03:16:21.819 --> 03:16:26.000]  This is an extinction-level threat to humanity, this process that we do.
[03:16:26.379 --> 03:16:28.159]  It is not sustainable.
[03:16:29.280 --> 03:16:38.659]  And by this process, what I am specifically saying is the notion that we should sacrifice our values and principles in a compromised fashion.
[03:16:38.760 --> 03:16:44.940]  That we should allow unjust or unprincipled legislation or corruption to go through if it means we can do things like fund the farmers.
[03:16:46.399 --> 03:16:50.700]  So when I see Speaker Johnson come up on the news and say, look, I'm offended by this bill too.
[03:16:50.879 --> 03:16:51.920]  I'm fiscally conservative.
[03:16:52.139 --> 03:16:53.219]  I'm America first.
[03:16:53.680 --> 03:16:57.579]  But we just have to get it done because it's gonna allow the Trump administration to be empowered.
[03:16:58.659 --> 03:16:59.780]  I'm thinking no.
[03:17:00.139 --> 03:17:01.260]  No compromise.
[03:17:01.559 --> 03:17:02.399]  No deals.
[03:17:02.620 --> 03:17:04.299]  No reaching across the aisle.
[03:17:04.459 --> 03:17:06.920]  There is no such thing as bipartisan.
[03:17:07.180 --> 03:17:08.860]  There is only such a thing as the Uniparty.
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:10.940]  And those who compromise become compromised.
[03:17:11.040 --> 03:17:12.979]  And Speaker Johnson is compromised.
[03:17:13.620 --> 03:17:16.020]  Going into skiffs with one opinion.
[03:17:16.200 --> 03:17:17.680]  Coming out with a completely different opinion.
[03:17:18.500 --> 03:17:20.399]  Backing everything that we have complained about.
[03:17:20.579 --> 03:17:23.299]  Everything that catalyzed the election of Donald Trump.
[03:17:24.079 --> 03:17:27.920]  Every mistake, corruption, and error that our government has made.
[03:17:29.690 --> 03:17:32.709]  That caused people to elect Donald Trump, Speaker Johnson backed.
[03:17:34.030 --> 03:17:39.329]  And I am sick of leaders and politicians and individuals who compromise.
[03:17:39.729 --> 03:17:44.049]  You want to make a deal, make a deal, but don't compromise the interests of the American people.
[03:17:44.250 --> 03:17:52.750]  It's not your right to compromise or to use my rights and my freedom and my interests as currency and your political game.
[03:17:53.690 --> 03:17:55.149]  You have no right.
[03:17:56.079 --> 03:17:58.840]  You cannot vote away my right to freedom of speech.
[03:17:59.040 --> 03:18:01.459]  You cannot vote away my right to bear arms.
[03:18:01.719 --> 03:18:04.399]  You cannot vote away my right to due process.
[03:18:05.219 --> 03:18:06.819]  You cannot vote away my freedom.
[03:18:06.940 --> 03:18:09.559]  That's why we are a republic and not a democracy.
[03:18:14.079 --> 03:18:16.879]  And all we have to do is not comply.
[03:18:17.420 --> 03:18:19.379]  All we have to do is civil disobedience.
[03:18:19.799 --> 03:18:25.000]  If the Democrats aren't going to fund the government unless we have all this corruption in there, then don't fund the government.
[03:18:25.899 --> 03:18:28.959]  And they're going to try to blame you for not compromising and not coming to the table?
[03:18:29.559 --> 03:18:30.559]  Say, no, no, no.
[03:18:30.920 --> 03:18:43.120]  It's not my fault that you are attempting to sell out the American people, and then you're blackmailing me in that effort.
[03:18:43.899 --> 03:18:45.899]  You're blackmailing us in that effort.
[03:18:46.340 --> 03:18:50.600]  Allow us to sell out the American people, otherwise your political career is over.
[03:18:50.680 --> 03:18:51.000]  No, no, no.
[03:18:51.200 --> 03:18:52.399]  It's not my fault.
[03:18:52.639 --> 03:18:53.559]  Shut it down.
[03:18:53.799 --> 03:18:54.260]  Fine.
[03:18:54.540 --> 03:18:55.520]  Call their bluff.
[03:18:59.940 --> 03:19:03.819]  Frankly, there's nothing more utopian to me than the notion that our government shuts down.
[03:19:04.700 --> 03:19:08.959]  Doesn't do the three things it's supposed to do, and it does everything else that it's not supposed to do at all.
[03:19:09.299 --> 03:19:09.540]  Fine.
[03:19:09.760 --> 03:19:10.540]  Don't fund it.
[03:19:10.700 --> 03:19:11.239]  Shut it down.
[03:19:12.559 --> 03:19:19.819]  I guess the TSA agents are going to be a little bit grumpy as they hope they get back pay and they're working for free for a couple of months.
[03:19:20.360 --> 03:19:20.760]  Whatever.
[03:19:21.159 --> 03:19:21.739]  Shut it down.
[03:19:22.239 --> 03:19:25.739]  Let's see how fine everything is without you.
[03:19:26.959 --> 03:19:40.280]  Because I tell you what, the Democrats, the leftists, the political class, the political establishment does not want the American people to experience how fine everything is indefinitely with a federal government that is shut down.
[03:19:42.340 --> 03:19:49.760]  So don't compromise with them because you're scared that you're going to be held responsible for not getting funding through.
[03:19:50.840 --> 03:19:51.899]  Just call it.
[03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:55.040]  Sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand.
[03:19:57.200 --> 03:20:06.760]  Folks, we're coming up on a break in two minutes, and we're going to do 30 minutes of hard-hitting analysis on the other side before the great Owen Schroyer takes over and hosts the War Room from 3 p.m.
[03:20:06.819 --> 03:20:07.500]  to 6 p.m.
[03:20:07.579 --> 03:20:07.879]  Central.
[03:20:08.200 --> 03:20:09.600]  I'm doing an outstanding job.
[03:20:10.639 --> 03:20:18.540]  And before we go to break, I just want to tie up this whole matrix conversation by encouraging you to go to thealexjohnestore.com.
[03:20:20.780 --> 03:20:26.639]  I know what it feels like to be frustrated and to not have a voice and to be not satisfied with your vote.
[03:20:27.809 --> 03:20:33.010]  To feel like it doesn't matter what you think or what you do or how you vote because the system's rigged.
[03:20:33.069 --> 03:20:38.770]  I know what it's like to be on the cusp of taking the black pill because you've just stared into the abyss for too long.
[03:20:40.969 --> 03:20:44.709]  But the best way And I truly believe this.
[03:20:44.829 --> 03:21:02.790]  The best way that you can fight against the Matrix, that you can fight for the Great Awakening, that you can fight for humanity and all of our freedoms, and for true enlightenment and morality and goodness and ultimately the mission of Christianity,
[03:21:02.790 --> 03:21:07.690]  I believe, is to go to the AlexJonesStore.com and support Alex Jones and this network.
[03:21:07.850 --> 03:21:22.079]  No matter what happens to Infowars, This is the avenue to keep us on the air because we cannot defeat the operators of the matrix without freedom of speech, without alternative media.

[03:21:44.469 --> 03:21:46.209]  It's also funding freedom.
[03:21:46.889 --> 03:21:56.280]  Nothing Strikes fear into the heart of the world's supervillains more than keeping Alex Jones and Infowars on the air.

[03:23:11.690 --> 03:23:20.590]  We'll have you back to talk about oil, but your topic today is suitcase nukes and events, chaos events that could strike the United States.
[03:23:20.790 --> 03:23:23.690]  You wanna give us a quick overview of that and then we'll get into some questions?
[03:23:25.049 --> 03:23:36.350]  Okay, well, in 1998, Prophecy Club, we were putting people on speaking tours in those days to 30 or 40 cities a month, about 5,000 people a month were attending our meetings.
[03:23:37.129 --> 03:23:41.610]  Now around 1998, we put Stanislav Lunev on a speaking tour.
[03:23:41.989 --> 03:23:46.549]  At the time, he was the highest ranking Russian military officer ever to defect from Russia.
[03:23:46.809 --> 03:23:51.409]  He made a Prophecy Club DVD called Russian Defector Warns America.
[03:23:51.770 --> 03:23:56.250]  You can watch this DVD instantly at watchprophecyclub.com.
[03:23:56.750 --> 03:24:11.790]  He says that he was part of a team sent from the Soviets to find locations to hide 50, quote, lost in Russia suitcase nuclear bombs lost back in the 1980s to be smuggled into the US. Well,
[03:24:11.850 --> 03:24:12.590]  that's one person.
[03:24:12.750 --> 03:24:15.809]  Bible says in the mouth of two or three witnesses, let a thing be established.
[03:24:16.530 --> 03:24:21.469]  Then May 5th of 2003, Michael Boldea, grandson of Demetri Dudeman, had a dream.
[03:24:21.770 --> 03:24:29.569]  He was shown suitcase nukes going off in California, Illinois, Michigan, Arizona, Washington State, Florida, and New York.
[03:24:29.790 --> 03:24:32.430]  He says, I saw an outline of a map of America.
[03:24:32.709 --> 03:24:34.870]  It outlines the states taking shape.
[03:24:35.170 --> 03:24:42.530]  I saw small lights begin to flicker on and off in some of the states, California, Illinois, Michigan, Arizona, Washington State, Florida, and New York.
[03:24:43.129 --> 03:24:44.530]  The light was rhythmic.
[03:24:45.219 --> 03:24:47.280]  And he said, I don't understand.
[03:24:47.280 --> 03:24:48.239]  What does this mean?
[03:24:48.479 --> 03:24:54.579]  He said, these are the places where those who are sent here long ago to bring fear and chaos have situated themselves.
[03:24:55.000 --> 03:25:01.440]  They lie in wait, planning and plotting destruction as coiled serpents looking for the hour they'll be loosed on this nation.
[03:25:02.000 --> 03:25:07.559]  Then October 15, 2004, he had another dream called Eagle and the Serpents.
[03:25:07.799 --> 03:25:11.420]  And he was shown that there's three attacks on the eagle that will be coming.
[03:25:11.700 --> 03:25:12.940]  The first one was...
[03:25:26.180 --> 03:25:27.620]  Nothing nefarious, apparently.
[03:25:28.159 --> 03:25:29.659]  But they're checking it all out.
[03:25:29.780 --> 03:25:31.639]  I think it's just one...
[03:25:32.860 --> 03:25:34.340]  There's a lot of drones authorized.
[03:25:34.659 --> 03:25:37.700]  Nothing nefarious, apparently, he says.
[03:25:38.079 --> 03:25:40.559]  A lot of authorized drones up there.
[03:25:40.819 --> 03:25:44.200]  And I wanted to show you a little bit of that clip of Mike Adams with his guest.
[03:25:44.340 --> 03:25:47.040]  Mike Adams does such a great job, his analysis, and he's just a great person.
[03:25:47.479 --> 03:25:48.280]  I love his dog.
[03:25:48.500 --> 03:25:49.360]  I just love his whole thing.
[03:25:49.479 --> 03:25:49.799]  It's great.
[03:25:52.739 --> 03:26:02.840]  Our government has been framing and branding Russia as an antagonist for 100 years.
[03:26:04.040 --> 03:26:05.979]  We've never been at war with Russia.
[03:26:07.299 --> 03:26:15.600]  I'm sure you could find some examples of Russian troops and American troops being in combat or killing one another.
[03:26:15.959 --> 03:26:18.879]  I'm sure it happened during the Cold War under cover.
[03:26:19.120 --> 03:26:21.059]  I'm sure there were assassinations and stuff during that time.
[03:26:21.680 --> 03:26:28.420]  But practically speaking, Russians and Americans have never killed each other in war.
[03:26:29.659 --> 03:26:36.600]  And for 100 years, We've been told over and over and over again that Russia is so bad.
[03:26:36.739 --> 03:26:37.440]  And maybe they are.
[03:26:37.559 --> 03:26:39.020]  Maybe Russia is corrupt.
[03:26:39.200 --> 03:26:40.520]  Maybe it's shambles.
[03:26:40.639 --> 03:26:46.200]  Maybe Putin is a strongman and maybe they do assassinate political opponents and arrest journalists.
[03:26:46.420 --> 03:26:48.260]  I'm sure a lot of those accusations are true.
[03:26:48.379 --> 03:26:53.159]  I'm also aware that everything that we've ever accused Russia of has been certainly true of the United States of America.
[03:26:55.219 --> 03:27:06.639]  I mean, you have Tucker Carlson basically saving the country by making Trump aware that Mike Pompeo was engaged in strategical plans to assassinate Julian Assange.
[03:27:08.360 --> 03:27:14.079]  I mean, that sounds more Soviet than America to me if you believe in the narrative that we've heard from the government.
[03:27:15.680 --> 03:27:22.379]  And there was this massive scare after World War II. The Red Scare.
[03:27:22.639 --> 03:27:37.909]  And that was true But weaponized by the military industrial complex to justify increased spending and expansion of all of these national security elements.
[03:27:40.379 --> 03:27:51.620]  And for decades and decades and decades, they were saying we had to ramp up our national security apparatus, our military, our nuclear capabilities, because Russia was expanding.
[03:27:52.020 --> 03:27:52.879]  Russia was a threat.
[03:27:53.120 --> 03:27:58.680]  And we spent billions, if not trillions of dollars doing so for decades.
[03:27:59.100 --> 03:28:11.969]  And Reagan himself was receiving Briefings months before the total collapse of the Soviet Union indicating to him that they needed more spending because of the increased threat.
[03:28:15.909 --> 03:28:20.549]  So they've lied about this threat because they make a lot of money off of the lie.
[03:28:23.170 --> 03:28:31.450]  And they're exploiting that 50 years of propaganda that they have disseminated on the American people and on the world for that matter right now in this moment.
[03:28:32.739 --> 03:28:33.639]  What's the drone story?
[03:28:33.799 --> 03:28:35.059]  Oh, it's always another Russian threat.
[03:28:35.139 --> 03:28:40.399]  If some dirty bomb goes off, if some nuke goes off, they're gonna blame Russia, but it's gonna be our own deep state, folks.
[03:28:40.500 --> 03:28:45.159]  There's no nukes coming into the United States secretly without our government totally aware of it.
[03:28:46.559 --> 03:28:47.319]  They know.
[03:28:47.500 --> 03:28:50.360]  They have all the most sophisticated technology to track all of this.
[03:28:50.520 --> 03:28:53.000]  They know exactly where these nukes are.
[03:28:53.940 --> 03:28:59.479]  And even if these missing suitcase nukes do exist somewhere, they probably don't even work anymore.
[03:28:59.479 --> 03:29:01.340]  They're probably not even operational anymore.
[03:29:03.190 --> 03:29:10.629]  Because the level of infrastructure and expertise required to maintain them has likely not been present over the course of the last 30 or 40 years.
[03:29:14.629 --> 03:29:15.850]  So I'm not buying it.
[03:29:17.030 --> 03:29:18.110]  I'm not buying it whatsoever.
[03:29:18.409 --> 03:29:28.370]  I think this is just another excuse to, or another priming of the American people so that if something does happen, they can blame Russia and use it as an excuse to get us into World War III, undermine the integrity of this administration.
[03:29:31.569 --> 03:29:32.770]  I mean, it was just...
[03:29:33.879 --> 03:29:40.360]  Four years ago that we experienced this COVID pandemic lockdown, virus was hardly deadly.
[03:29:40.440 --> 03:29:43.940]  Yes, a little bit more deadly than the average flu, but nothing to be alarmed of.
[03:29:44.180 --> 03:29:45.959]  Vaccines, much more harmful.
[03:29:46.360 --> 03:29:48.520]  Shutting down the entire economy, much more harmful.
[03:29:48.700 --> 03:29:55.639]  You realize that every 1% of unemployment goes up, 40,000 people in the United States die because of heart-related stress issues.
[03:29:55.920 --> 03:29:57.219]  Stress-related heart issues, rather.
[03:30:00.610 --> 03:30:15.950]  So the response to the pandemic, even if you believe that the vaccines are safe, which they're not, the response to the pandemic, shutting down all these businesses, ramping up unemployment to record levels, was deadlier than the pandemic itself.
[03:30:17.760 --> 03:30:33.200]  And despite the fact that every study shows it, that it's abundantly obvious that the EPA even during the pandemic was saying that masks don't work, that we know that standing six feet apart had nothing to do with it, that two weeks to slow the spread was a total lie, that shutting down all these businesses was totally unnecessary.
[03:30:35.040 --> 03:30:38.959]  That the virus itself was manufactured in a lab funded by our own government.
[03:30:39.139 --> 03:30:57.280]  That the vaccines themselves were not safe or effective and it was just part of a political class money laundering scheme so our politicians could skim off the top of their investments in pharmaceutical companies all while protecting the liability of those who inoculated and killed millions upon millions of people in the United States and throughout the world with their shots.
[03:30:59.590 --> 03:31:16.149]  Despite the fact that all this happened four years ago, all the evidence is mounting, you still have California Governor Gavin Newsom with the audacity to declare, this is breaking news, a state of emergency over the bird flu,
[03:31:16.510 --> 03:31:18.930]  calling it a proactive action.
[03:31:19.549 --> 03:31:23.850]  It's not an emergency if nothing has emerged yet, bro.
[03:31:24.229 --> 03:31:26.329]  That's what the word emergency means.
[03:31:27.909 --> 03:31:34.549]  Oh, something has unexpectedly emerged or spontaneously emerged, so we have to respond to it because it is an emergency.
[03:31:37.690 --> 03:31:47.110]  So calling it a state of emergency and simultaneously calling it a proactive action are immediately in conflict with one another.
[03:31:47.250 --> 03:31:58.190]  Logically, I mean the cognitive dissonance to believe this focus group manufactured human being with no soul simultaneously operating and within the matrix is unbelievable to me.
[03:31:58.270 --> 03:32:02.450]  California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an emergency proclamation on Wednesday right before Christmas.
[03:32:03.649 --> 03:32:07.709]  In response to growing concerns over bird flu cases in the state across the country.
[03:32:08.329 --> 03:32:14.389]  State of emergency proclamation comes after more bird flu cases were detected in Southern California dairy cows.
[03:32:14.950 --> 03:32:25.709]  Governor's office stated Wednesday also saw the Centers for Disease Control Prevention report the first severe illness in a person due to bird flu from a Louisiana case.
[03:32:27.329 --> 03:32:30.149]  One person gets the flu and now we're in a state of emergency.
[03:32:31.659 --> 03:32:37.979]  This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak, Newsom said in a statement.
[03:32:41.780 --> 03:32:56.899]  One person gets sick and suddenly one of the largest economies in the world, the state of California, can use as an excuse to hijack all resources.
[03:32:57.979 --> 03:32:59.760]  I thought we lived in a democracy.
[03:33:00.790 --> 03:33:07.549]  I thought California had democratic values, but one person in Louisiana gets sick and California declares a state of emergency.
[03:33:07.770 --> 03:33:13.170]  You think that's sustainable in our nation long term?
[03:33:13.750 --> 03:33:19.329]  Every state, every government, whether national or state level or local, can just declare an emergency every time someone gets sick.
[03:33:22.010 --> 03:33:22.530]  It's not.
[03:33:22.930 --> 03:33:43.709]  But it's exactly the same type of crap that is backed in this omnibus bill, this 1547-page bill that claims to be funding the farmers while our government obviously doesn't care about the farmers because they're selling all of the land to Bill Gates and the CCP. When they're funding and backing these organizations,
[03:33:43.989 --> 03:33:53.209]  globalist institutions, whether it's the World Economic Forum, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Clinton Foundation, who advocate for the eradication of all cattle because of the methane.
[03:33:55.489 --> 03:33:58.729]  But if you don't vote for this omnibus, it's because you don't care about the farmers.
[03:33:59.870 --> 03:34:00.950]  You don't care about them.
[03:34:01.229 --> 03:34:03.110]  Oh, you hate the working man.
[03:34:03.290 --> 03:34:15.489]  You hate the man with the flannel shirt, rolled up sleeves, tirelessly working in the dirt to make something grow by the grace of God because the sun inexplicably rises every single day and the seasons change.
[03:34:16.110 --> 03:34:18.530]  And the rain magically falls out of the sky.
[03:34:19.520 --> 03:34:29.420]  You don't care about the salt of the earth people, the man who is working by the sweat of his brow because of the tragic fall of man and the condemnation of God himself for our betrayal.
[03:34:29.659 --> 03:34:39.500]  You don't care about that man who is suffering the human condition more than anyone else without having done anything wrong because you will not support this 1547-page omnibus bill that funds biolabs all over the world.
[03:34:42.239 --> 03:34:45.500]  Because you don't advocate for research and studies and corruption.
[03:34:45.500 --> 03:34:51.840]  Because you don't support the notion that any state, local or federal government can declare an emergency when someone in Louisiana gets the flu.
[03:34:54.840 --> 03:34:57.840]  It's because you don't care about the working man.
[03:35:01.799 --> 03:35:19.659]  They want to silence you and then hijack your identity and then brand you and perpetuate that brand so your truth, the truth, the truth that you know can never be exposed to the other people because they understand that every word that comes out of your mouth,
[03:35:19.700 --> 03:35:28.559]  every post that comes out of your social media accounts that exposes them is another red pill distributed to another sleeping person just waiting.
[03:35:30.469 --> 03:35:36.969]  Waiting to discover the answer to the question, what is it that has been bothering me?
[03:35:38.129 --> 03:35:40.930]  Quietly pastoring me my entire life.
[03:35:41.110 --> 03:35:44.389]  What is it that seems missing from my soul?
[03:35:46.489 --> 03:35:48.889]  They don't want you to give them the red pill.
[03:35:51.049 --> 03:36:01.809]  That will allow them to discover the answer that they're living within a matrix, that it is corrupt, that it is for the purpose of exploiting them, subjugating them, mining them, farming them.
[03:36:08.389 --> 03:36:09.430]  We're doing a clip six.
[03:36:10.790 --> 03:36:11.969]  Let me just drive it home.
[03:36:12.969 --> 03:36:15.170]  You like the last pandemic response so much?
[03:36:15.409 --> 03:36:16.709]  You think we should declare an emergency again?
[03:36:17.090 --> 03:36:18.629]  Why don't you watch this clip number six?
[03:36:19.659 --> 03:36:27.540]  See that the vaccinated kids are the sickest, the partially vaccinated kids are not as sick, and the unvaccinated kids are the healthiest.
[03:36:27.799 --> 03:36:32.840]  I've been in practice long enough that I can actually tell you that the unvaccinated kids are healthier.
[03:36:33.079 --> 03:36:45.229]  I can also tell you that if the unvaccinated kids are a problem, Then, according to what's out there, there should be a lot of hospital admissions for my unvaxxed kids getting those things.
[03:36:45.590 --> 03:36:46.850]  And I'm seeing the opposite.
[03:36:47.090 --> 03:36:59.209]  The most interesting stories that we did were the first child was injured, or maybe the second, and they go on to have more children and decide not to vaccinate because of the horrors of what's happened.
[03:36:59.770 --> 03:37:04.690]  And the difference between their unvaccinated child, the same parents, same everything.
[03:37:05.629 --> 03:37:09.409]  It's that that unvaccinated child is 100% healthy.
[03:37:09.649 --> 03:37:24.860]  Yeah, I have quite a few patients in my practice who have two children and those are great controls because most of them didn't figure out Right away, so their child got some vaccines, but they all stopped it fairly early on,
[03:37:24.959 --> 03:37:30.219]  and there's a huge difference between the two children and the level of how they were affected.
[03:37:30.440 --> 03:37:37.500]  But, I mean, if you start looking and pulling in all those people who have that same experience, I think you're going to see the same thing across the board.
[03:37:37.739 --> 03:37:44.340]  The level of that second child and how they're affected is going to be much less, if at all, compared to the first child who was completely vaccinated.
[03:37:44.520 --> 03:37:51.420]  Okay, and if that doesn't convince you, A new study has confirmed that COVID shots for kids are making the problem worse.
[03:37:51.600 --> 03:37:52.299]  Let's watch this.
[03:37:52.860 --> 03:37:57.940]  Pfizer mRNA vaccinated children significantly are more likely to get COVID-19 than unvaccinated peers.
[03:37:58.260 --> 03:38:12.760]  A new study found that Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccinated children are 159% more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 257% more likely to develop symptomatic COVID-19 than their unvaccinated peers.
[03:38:13.280 --> 03:38:31.459]  We're good to go.
[03:38:35.149 --> 03:38:39.750]  Including 614 children and those six months to four years.
[03:38:39.969 --> 03:38:47.170]  It goes on to explain here directly here that the key findings were they have an increased risk with the vaccination.
[03:38:47.489 --> 03:39:00.989]  Children vaccinated with the BioNTech vaccine prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection were 159% more likely to get infected and 257% more likely to develop symptomatic COVID-19 vaccine with a hazard ratio of 2.59.
[03:39:01.409 --> 03:39:04.129]  Prior infection offers robust protection as well.
[03:39:04.989 --> 03:39:10.709]  They had a significantly lower risk of infection if they were previously infected, and no protective effect from vaccination alone.
[03:39:10.930 --> 03:39:17.610]  There was no significant reduction in the risk of infection or symptomatic COVID-19 for vaccinated children, which means that the vaccines literally do not work.
[03:39:17.829 --> 03:39:32.270]  Everybody knows, and I'll always mention it, I had a famous back and forth with Ben Shapiro, where he called my audience retarded, called us dopes for not wanting to get vaccinated because I said your immune system has a better chance at fighting COVID-19 and developing immunity than you would if you got the vaccine.
[03:39:32.430 --> 03:39:33.430]  And it looks like I was right.
[03:39:33.649 --> 03:39:35.850]  He called me stupid, but joke's on you.
[03:39:35.989 --> 03:39:40.329]  I guess having your wife being a doctor isn't the end all, and maybe a little humility can go a long way.
[03:39:40.409 --> 03:39:42.370]  He did a great job covering that study.
[03:39:42.569 --> 03:39:43.530]  The data is in.
[03:39:43.629 --> 03:39:44.350]  The studies are in.
[03:39:46.530 --> 03:39:47.790]  The vaccines are not safe.
[03:39:47.930 --> 03:39:48.610]  They're not effective.
[03:39:49.729 --> 03:39:54.010]  COVID-19, it's not safe, but it's not nearly as dangerous as they said.
[03:39:54.690 --> 03:40:04.909]  Now we've got omnibus bills that are funding the exact institutions and political establishments responsible for the outbreak of the problem to begin with because they want the problem to happen again.
[03:40:06.069 --> 03:40:07.350]  They love a crisis.
[03:40:07.530 --> 03:40:08.690]  What was it, Nancy Pelosi, that said?
[03:40:12.190 --> 03:40:15.290]  Never lose the opportunity to exploit a good crisis or something of that nature.
[03:40:15.290 --> 03:40:16.129]  I'm paraphrasing it.
[03:40:17.870 --> 03:40:19.049]  They don't care about the farmers.
[03:40:19.250 --> 03:40:20.450]  They don't want you to be healthy.
[03:40:20.649 --> 03:40:21.670]  They don't care about any of that.
[03:40:21.729 --> 03:40:24.329]  They want you unhealthy, sick, poor, and dependent.
[03:40:27.469 --> 03:40:31.489]  And they brand themselves as these heroes while they villainize people with the audacity to tell the truth.
[03:40:31.930 --> 03:40:36.049]  I mean, hell, Alex Jones has been talking about this stuff for 10, 20, 30 years.
[03:40:36.170 --> 03:40:38.129]  He's been talking about atrazine in the water forever.
[03:40:38.209 --> 03:40:45.450]  It's the whole foundation of the most famous Alex Jones clip of all time where he says, I'm sick of him putting chemicals in the water that turned the freaking frogs gay.
[03:40:45.709 --> 03:40:50.370]  That was atrazine in the water that was making the frogs gay.
[03:40:55.069 --> 03:40:55.430]  Genderless.
[03:40:57.299 --> 03:40:59.719]  This is clip number 11 of RFK coming out.
[03:40:59.780 --> 03:41:12.899]  Now the establishment, now the administrations are coming out and admitting all of the things that we've been telling people for years because the waking up is snowballing, but we have to get it to snowball faster and faster and faster because as soon as people realize the truth, lies are rendered moot.
[03:41:13.780 --> 03:41:15.500]  Lies are a weapon of mass destruction.
[03:41:15.579 --> 03:41:27.500]  If you wanna neutralize weapons of mass destruction, if you're concerned about weapons of mass destruction, then you have to propagate and support and fight for freedom of speech because it is the only medium through which the truth can be conveyed across humanity.
[03:41:27.620 --> 03:41:34.680]  Let's watch clip number 11. Probably the most disturbing endocrine disruptor, and this is something we should all be looking at, is atrazine.
[03:41:38.760 --> 03:41:47.170]  But they took atrazine And they put it in a tank with 40 frogs for three years.
[03:41:47.770 --> 03:41:53.030]  They put it below the exposure levels that EPA considers acceptable to humans.
[03:41:54.010 --> 03:42:01.370]  And 30 of those frogs, they were all male frogs, and they were double Z, male frogs, so they were super males.
[03:42:02.229 --> 03:42:05.090]  And 30 of those frogs were chemically castrated.
[03:42:08.409 --> 03:42:11.969]  Four of them turned into females and produced fertile eggs.
[03:42:12.569 --> 03:42:16.829]  Atrazine's a pesticide that's in much of the tap water kids drink today and the food that they eat.
[03:42:16.989 --> 03:42:24.409]  When Berkeley professor of integrative biology Tyrone B. Hayes investigated atrazine, he did an experiment on frogs where he introduced atrazine to the water.
[03:42:24.610 --> 03:42:28.930]  The result was that many of the male frogs turned gay and mated with other male frogs.
[03:42:29.190 --> 03:42:33.110]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the freaking frogs gay!
[03:42:33.309 --> 03:42:34.170]  Do you understand?
[03:42:34.520 --> 03:42:37.600]  And look, the fact of the matter is, this is an information war.
[03:42:37.680 --> 03:42:39.059]  That's why we're called Infowars.
[03:42:39.100 --> 03:42:43.639]  It's been going on for much longer than this institution, this establishment, this operation has existed.
[03:42:43.780 --> 03:42:45.479]  And it's going on right now.
[03:42:45.600 --> 03:42:46.500]  It's not going to be over soon.
[03:42:46.620 --> 03:42:48.459]  Frankly, the information war is never over.
[03:42:49.159 --> 03:42:51.639]  You're either winning it or you're losing it.
[03:42:51.700 --> 03:42:57.059]  But there are those who will always try to propagate, perpetuate lies, and then make everyone believe those lies.
[03:42:57.239 --> 03:42:59.600]  It's a constant battle between lies and the truth.
[03:42:59.760 --> 03:43:01.360]  It's the same as the battle between good and evil.
[03:43:01.700 --> 03:43:02.959]  Playing out right before our eyes.
[03:43:04.959 --> 03:43:06.479]  And so they're lying to us about vaccines.
[03:43:06.639 --> 03:43:07.719]  They're lying to us about pandemics.
[03:43:07.860 --> 03:43:10.180]  They're lying to us about the threat of the next pandemic.
[03:43:10.379 --> 03:43:17.639]  And then they're actually enacting policies which perpetuate the problem and respond to problems that aren't really problems whatsoever.
[03:43:18.559 --> 03:43:23.879]  Whether it's Gavin Newsom declaring a proactive emergency, which is senseless, nonsensical rhetoric.
[03:43:24.840 --> 03:43:31.020]  Or whether it's this 1,547-page omnibus bill that is total political compromise.
[03:43:33.350 --> 03:43:37.930]  It should be vetoed by everyone.
[03:43:38.969 --> 03:43:48.430]  We've got this clip of Laura Logan, clip number nine, saying this is a blood sport for them, and she's right, because they play in blood.
[03:43:48.750 --> 03:43:50.250]  Blood is their currency.
[03:43:50.649 --> 03:43:52.709]  Life and death is their currency.
[03:43:53.350 --> 03:43:56.690]  This is Laura Logan on the Age of Information Warfare.
[03:43:56.829 --> 03:43:57.010]  Watch.
[03:43:58.030 --> 03:44:07.030]  We live in the age of information warfare, where propaganda is not simply a weapon, it is the entire field of battle.
[03:44:08.190 --> 03:44:16.549]  This is a war for our minds that is aided by advanced technology, and we have never been here, not in all of human history.
[03:44:18.590 --> 03:44:28.969]  It is a moment when we as journalists should stand together, united, and regardless of politics, we should fight for the truth and we should fight for freedom.
[03:44:30.049 --> 03:44:38.069]  Yet, not very long ago, we allowed one of our own, Tucker Carlson, to be branded as a traitor simply for doing his job.
[03:44:39.899 --> 03:44:51.899]  In fact, there were many so-called journalists who were leading the charge against Tucker, accusing him of treason for the simple fact of interviewing the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
[03:44:52.379 --> 03:44:57.639]  And to my knowledge, there was not a single legacy media institution that spoke up.
[03:45:01.250 --> 03:45:04.989]  This was more than a politically motivated attack on one man.
[03:45:05.409 --> 03:45:10.549]  It was a betrayal of the most sacred principles of a free press.
[03:45:10.989 --> 03:45:15.149]  And my media colleagues know this to be true no matter what they say.
[03:45:16.309 --> 03:45:25.629]  My fear is that they either no longer care or that they lack the moral courage to be honest, including with themselves.
[03:45:27.100 --> 03:45:37.120]  I have worked at the highest levels of the media as a full-time correspondent for 60 Minutes, chief foreign correspondent for CBS News, chief foreign affairs correspondent for CBS News.
[03:45:37.360 --> 03:45:39.540]  That was my home for 16 years.
[03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:47.379]  And as a journalist, I have sat down with world leaders, mass murderers, and terrorists.
[03:45:48.120 --> 03:45:51.700]  And I have held people on both sides of the aisle accountable.
[03:45:54.440 --> 03:46:01.639]  I have seen suffering and I have faced evil and I have walked through the fires of hell on distant battlefields.
[03:46:02.000 --> 03:46:06.100]  I faced my own death at the hands of a mob of some 200 men.
[03:46:06.319 --> 03:46:08.260]  Laura Logan is an American hero.
[03:46:08.280 --> 03:46:17.969]  She's a very talented journalist, analyst, and a very honest This is an information war.
[03:46:18.370 --> 03:46:19.750]  They are attacking people.
[03:46:19.850 --> 03:46:22.270]  They're trying to bring them down, if not arrest them.
[03:46:22.389 --> 03:46:24.250]  They're trying to assassinate them if they can't.
[03:46:24.389 --> 03:46:25.729]  They're trying to imprison them.
[03:46:26.690 --> 03:46:28.450]  Everybody has three lives.
[03:46:29.250 --> 03:46:30.709]  First, they try to censor you.
[03:46:31.030 --> 03:46:33.350]  If that doesn't work, they try to imprison you.
[03:46:33.469 --> 03:46:35.989]  And if that doesn't work, then they try to kill you.
[03:46:36.190 --> 03:46:38.969]  Those are your three lives.
[03:46:40.049 --> 03:46:45.770]  And once they get through the Alex Joneses and the Tucker Carlson's and the Joe Rogan's and the Donald Trump's, then they get to you.
