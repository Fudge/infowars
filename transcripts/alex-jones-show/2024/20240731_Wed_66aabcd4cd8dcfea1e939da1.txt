[00:00:18.826 --> 00:00:20.967]  It's Wednesday, July 31st, 2024.
[00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:27.610]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we have a massive raft of incredibly informative guests coming up.
[00:00:30.977 --> 00:00:42.600]  That's going to be interesting if they do debate.
[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.041]  They're going to do debate, held several, if he lives.
[00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:46.221]  Yeah.
[00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:47.702]  Do you think they're going to try to take him out again?
[00:00:47.742 --> 00:00:47.922]  Yes.
[00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:48.742]  Yeah, I do too.
[00:00:49.963 --> 00:00:50.163]  Yes.
[00:00:50.663 --> 00:00:53.144]  If they did that, this is not the only time they're going to do that.
[00:00:53.484 --> 00:00:57.705]  And then, also, that one was so Lee Harvey Oswald.
[00:00:58.126 --> 00:01:01.347]  It was so perfect lone gunman.
[00:01:01.587 --> 00:01:04.348]  At a certain point, if you're that sloppy, you're in on it.
[00:01:05.368 --> 00:01:10.550]  Someone had to at least know that he was under threat and done a piss poor job.
[00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.890]  Or didn't care.
[00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.410]  They didn't care.
[00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.630]  Yeah.
[00:01:12.344 --> 00:01:17.607]  A Secret Service counter-sniper is predicting another assassination attempt before November.
[00:01:18.188 --> 00:01:29.355]  In an email obtained by RealClearPolitics, a Secret Service agent with 20 years' experience on the counter-sniper team is announcing he's going to blow the whistle until all of his supervisors are fired.
[00:01:30.135 --> 00:01:34.998]  The counter-sniper says his mission is to prevent another JFK-style assassination.
[00:01:35.518 --> 00:01:39.081]  And the only reason that hasn't happened is because they've gotten lucky.
[00:01:40.086 --> 00:01:48.268]  He says Secret Service leadership is corrupt and states clearly, quote, we all should expect another assassination attempt to happen before November.
[00:01:48.848 --> 00:01:52.869]  We've exposed our inability to protect our leaders due to our leadership.
[00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.570]  After this email went public, it was wiped off the Secret Service servers.
[00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.351]  There's a massive cover-up underway.
[00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:30.183]  You know, I was sitting here just getting ready for the broadcast today, this live Wednesday transmission, and I was thinking to myself, we've got all of this incredible news and information to cover and go over today, and I will get it, I'll get a lot of it, but really front and center is the fact that the Deep State on the 13th of July
[00:02:32.588 --> 00:02:33.409]  Tried to kill Trump.
[00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:35.070]  The totals stand down.
[00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.391]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:02:37.151 --> 00:02:41.714]  And now that Trump's even more powerful, they are more committed to do it than ever.
[00:02:42.635 --> 00:02:48.419]  The good news is the consensus across the political spectrum is that the deep state tried to kill Trump.
[00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:53.362]  And hell, most Democrats will even admit that and say, well, too bad Trump didn't die.
[00:02:54.943 --> 00:02:58.366]  So that's how crazed these maniacs are.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.441]  So we have Roger Stone joining us today.
[00:03:03.763 --> 00:03:05.624]  We have James O'Keefe joining us today.
[00:03:06.845 --> 00:03:11.849]  We have popular and very informative journalist, talk show host Liz Wheeler joining us today.
[00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.655]  And we'll be talking about this incredibly important subject, obviously, for not just America, but the rest of the world.
[00:03:20.195 --> 00:03:24.499]  And also, what would have happened if they would have killed Trump?
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.041]  What would they have done?
[00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:28.602]  Well, I believe they would stage false flags.
[00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:36.205]  To demonize Trump supporters and put us into civil emergencies, what they would call it, would be martial law.
[00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:38.806]  Because all the preparations have been made for that.
[00:03:38.826 --> 00:03:44.568]  And I want to be clear, I don't say things like that to sound ominous and entertaining.
[00:03:44.628 --> 00:03:45.628]  It's not entertaining.
[00:03:46.208 --> 00:03:53.731]  With 96 days left in the most important election in world history, it's what's on the table, it's the trajectory of everything.
[00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:57.752]  172 days, a lifetime in this political climate, until Trump
[00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.090]  We hope and pray he is inaugurated.
[00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.650]  So all this and more coming up today.
[00:04:07.051 --> 00:04:09.131]  There's just so much other news.
[00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:18.693]  We have Maduro, the dictator, and the numbers coming out of just how bad he was losing by 60 plus percent.
[00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:22.193]  And now he's declared martial law.
[00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:24.054]  He's trying to arrest his political opposition.
[00:04:25.154 --> 00:04:29.918]  Same thing that the corrupt groups do, not just here, but all over the world.
[00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:33.582]  This is what these desperate, corrupt governments are doing.
[00:04:33.602 --> 00:04:37.325]  We have the Hamas leader killed in Tehran.
[00:04:38.546 --> 00:04:48.755]  And I said day one when October 7th happened, Israel should have killed the leaders of Hamas, not carpet bombed a lot of innocent people, and Israel lost the high ground doing that.
[00:04:49.496 --> 00:04:51.238]  But I'm also not going to cry in my pillow
[00:04:52.535 --> 00:04:55.256]  That the leader of Hamas has been killed.
[00:04:55.916 --> 00:05:04.878]  So I hope that gives Israel an excuse to stop what they're doing and to wind this thing down that should have been wound down a long time ago.
[00:05:05.578 --> 00:05:06.978]  There's so much more coming up today.
[00:05:06.998 --> 00:05:07.958]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:05:08.438 --> 00:05:11.339]  Please follow me on Instagram, Alex Jones, and of course, InfoWars.com.
[00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.119]  It's Wednesday, July 31st, 2024.
[00:05:19.394 --> 00:05:48.372]  Kamala Harris is unable to get anybody to her rallies, so she's now resorted to getting hip-hop dancers and stars and pornographic actresses, basically, to twerk and dance for crowds that are free, free concerts, and then as soon as Kamala Harris gets up on the stage, literally everybody turns around and leaves, and there's really not even much applause for the dancers.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.081]  I mean, this is pathetic.
[00:05:52.742 --> 00:06:00.186]  And it's happening in Illinois, it's happening in Atlanta, it's happening everywhere that Kamala Neepat Harris goes.
[00:06:00.206 --> 00:06:03.368]  We're going to be milling over all of that today.
[00:06:03.408 --> 00:06:09.212]  We've got the big developments in Venezuela, the huge developments in Iran and Israel, the ongoing expanding war.
[00:06:09.232 --> 00:06:15.636]  We've got the Olympics continuing to tank in front of the whole world as every globalist operation turns to pure crap.
[00:06:18.151 --> 00:06:27.977]  We have major studies out over 50% of liberal white women under 50, under 30, have a mental health issue.
[00:06:27.997 --> 00:06:29.638]  Well, I can tell you that.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.582]  That's just some of what we've got on this massive transmission lined up for you today.
[00:06:35.622 --> 00:06:36.343]  We also have J.D.
[00:06:36.363 --> 00:06:39.265]  Vance being attacked by MSNBC political analysts, claims J.D.
[00:06:39.285 --> 00:06:40.786]  Vance wants more white children.
[00:06:40.806 --> 00:06:44.088]  And what he said is, we need to have
[00:06:45.575 --> 00:06:46.276]  More families.
[00:06:47.096 --> 00:06:48.097]  We need to have more children.
[00:06:48.498 --> 00:06:49.939]  The West is being depopulated.
[00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:53.842]  Of course, they ignored the fact that he's married to an Indian lady and has mixed kids.
[00:06:54.283 --> 00:06:55.564]  But it wouldn't matter if he had white kids.
[00:06:55.884 --> 00:06:56.885]  It's okay to be white.
[00:06:58.496 --> 00:07:08.863]  But this is really the anti-white, anti-population agenda that we see, and people need to stop bowing to it and point it out for the racist, divide-and-conquer crap it is.
[00:07:09.484 --> 00:07:14.728]  Google claims censoring searches on Donald Trump assassination attempt was an innocent mistake.
[00:07:15.348 --> 00:07:20.772]  Any search you did, basically, on Trump, you would get Donald Duck for two days this weekend.
[00:07:20.872 --> 00:07:22.793]  And they do it on purpose, and it's come out they do it on purpose.
[00:07:23.314 --> 00:07:25.015]  Every time they get caught, they go, oh, it's an accident.
[00:07:26.296 --> 00:07:27.977]  It's total and complete.
[00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:30.519]  Election meddling.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:44.945]  And as you know, a few weeks ago, the Supreme Court shot down multiple states' lawsuits coming in and saying, don't censor people on these platforms because it's in the law that they are utilities.
[00:07:46.226 --> 00:07:52.708]  And if they start censoring, that makes them a publication, so they no longer have the immunity that they have from what people post.
[00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:59.131]  And the Supreme Court overruled the conservatives, several of the conservatives,
[00:08:00.592 --> 00:08:12.234]  Um, like Barrett voted against it and CNN, I got the headline right here, spun it that, oh, the Supreme Court defended the rights of big text free speech.
[00:08:12.254 --> 00:08:15.955]  It's not text big free speech to censor people.
[00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:18.515]  That's a suppression of free speech.
[00:08:18.555 --> 00:08:24.676]  And they talk about how Alito got really, really mad about it and said, this is cut and dry.
[00:08:24.756 --> 00:08:26.997]  So we've got all of that for you.
[00:08:28.038 --> 00:08:28.938]  Here today as well.
[00:08:28.998 --> 00:08:34.821]  But sitting back, all this news is very interesting and it's all important in and of itself.
[00:08:36.202 --> 00:08:44.766]  But we just witnessed an attempted deep state coup against President Trump and the American people.
[00:08:46.187 --> 00:08:47.747]  And by the grace of God, he didn't die.
[00:08:47.767 --> 00:08:56.811]  And as I've said probably 500 times, since they tried to kill Trump 18 days ago,
[00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:05.743]  They're going to do it again, and again, and again.
[00:09:05.763 --> 00:09:26.657]  And I covered some of this yesterday, but I want to really drill back into it because a reportedly senior Secret Service sniper trainer, and it was confirmed to be on the Secret Service system, blew the whistle with his name redacted, and they've since removed it.
[00:09:28.092 --> 00:09:30.694]  And said, this is going to make copycats try to kill Trump.
[00:09:30.794 --> 00:09:32.555]  Plus, it looks like there was a total standout.
[00:09:33.917 --> 00:09:42.163]  Someone will try to kill him again before the election in just 90-something days.
[00:09:43.104 --> 00:09:51.130]  And this agency is filled with political operatives, the Democrat Party operatives, who have on purpose pulled the protection away from Trump.
[00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:52.891]  And they're going to get him killed.
[00:09:52.971 --> 00:09:56.454]  And the entire leadership needs to be made to resign right now.
[00:09:58.493 --> 00:10:01.535]  That's why Trump has to not purge people by putting them in prison or killing them.
[00:10:02.336 --> 00:10:09.180]  He just has to use the power he has to fire anyone from the Democratic Party political class from his administration.
[00:10:10.601 --> 00:10:12.503]  The problem is it's such a huge, sprawling network.
[00:10:12.543 --> 00:10:17.486]  Trump doesn't understand who all the people are, neither do I. I've got a better understanding than he does.
[00:10:17.546 --> 00:10:18.527]  I constantly research it.
[00:10:19.147 --> 00:10:22.990]  And so people with horror are noticing that already some of the Trump loyalists are being replaced.
[00:10:24.122 --> 00:10:33.647]  Never Trumpers other people are being brought in now certainly some of them are like JD Vance and have since the last eight years been totally different and has a history that Trump thinks he can trust and I think we can trust as well.
[00:10:35.247 --> 00:10:39.890]  I mean Vance didn't even confidence told me, you know, I'm I've got it.
[00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.451]  I said I hear you're probably the VP because yeah, I got it.
[00:10:44.072 --> 00:10:44.472]  I said really?
[00:10:44.492 --> 00:10:46.613]  Yeah.
[00:10:46.713 --> 00:10:48.654]  And so that was a month before it got announced.
[00:10:50.054 --> 00:10:50.455]  By Trump.
[00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:53.126]  I mean, I want to believe Vance is good.
[00:10:53.326 --> 00:10:55.167]  The establishment hates his guts and is attacking him.
[00:10:55.227 --> 00:10:57.388]  I should tell you, they certainly think he's good.
[00:10:57.448 --> 00:11:08.153]  But Google and Instagram, owned by Facebook Meta, they censored the videos of Trump being shot.
[00:11:08.213 --> 00:11:12.456]  And they censored the videos of Trump raising his fist and saying, fight, fight, fight.
[00:11:13.236 --> 00:11:17.838]  And they censored any investigation or members of Congress talking about it.
[00:11:17.878 --> 00:11:18.599]  That's all admitted.
[00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:20.680]  There was a concerted effort everywhere but X.
[00:11:22.841 --> 00:11:29.406]  Formerly Twitter, to suppress all discussions of the fact they tried to kill him.
[00:11:29.426 --> 00:11:36.811]  And you saw that the first eight hours where Forbes and AP and Reuters said, oh, there was some popping noises and Trump slipped and fell down.
[00:11:36.851 --> 00:11:37.812]  We don't know what happened.
[00:11:38.412 --> 00:11:43.696]  Even though it was on record that there were shootings and person dead and others wounded within minutes.
[00:11:44.937 --> 00:11:46.899]  And it was on the local news and I was on the air.
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.182]  Within an hour, you know, getting off an airplane and learning
[00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:54.010]  As the plane was landing, this had just happened.
[00:11:55.650 --> 00:12:04.153]  So, I wanna just have a discussion with everybody about, and a thought process, and I'll open the phones up.
[00:12:05.633 --> 00:12:12.255]  We were gonna do a X Spaces today, but today's probably not the best day because I have all these guests.
[00:12:12.295 --> 00:12:15.736]  I have Roger Stone, James O'Keefe, Lewis Wheeler, Chase Geyser.
[00:12:17.517 --> 00:12:20.138]  So we'll do a Spaces on X tomorrow.
[00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:34.016]  On what would have happened if Trump was assassinated, and will they try to assassinate him again, which the obvious answer is yes.
[00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:39.039]  It's really one of their only moves, the only big move they've got left.
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:50.808]  So this is like knowing that your neighbor, let's say it's a woman, she's got the day off, she's got her two-year-old at home.
[00:12:52.413 --> 00:12:57.936]  She falls asleep on the couch, forgot to lock the sliding glass door, the toddler goes out, falls in the swimming pool and drowns.
[00:12:58.677 --> 00:13:06.501]  What if you could look ahead in the future as the neighbor, or even the mom, and you knew that was going to happen, what would you do to stop that happening?
[00:13:07.242 --> 00:13:13.546]  Well, this is a lot bigger than one toddler falling in the pool and dying, because this will trigger the excuse for major civil unrest,
[00:13:14.431 --> 00:13:20.293]  The New World Order has been gearing up for and the civil war they've been trying to prepare because they know they're going to lose politically in the long run.
[00:13:20.913 --> 00:13:27.334]  We've got the high ground, the momentum, the initiative, the history, the smart people on our side.
[00:13:27.495 --> 00:13:36.497]  We are going to win unless they try to bring us into giant wars and catastrophe and civil unrest.
[00:13:36.537 --> 00:13:43.359]  And every expert political analyst that has really accurate histories, like Martin Armstrong yesterday,
[00:13:44.458 --> 00:13:51.464]  You know, 98% accuracy says it's guaranteed they're going to start a larger war or expand the wars that are there.
[00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:54.087]  It's guaranteed they're going to try to kill Trump.
[00:13:54.107 --> 00:13:56.409]  We're just stating fact here.
[00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:11.882]  And I don't want to just be here like a fly on the wall and just chronicle what's happening and then be right about it coming, like I predicted the Trump assassination attempt and Biden stepping down to the day two weeks before it happened.
[00:14:15.393 --> 00:14:16.274]  I want to stop this.
[00:14:18.796 --> 00:14:28.985]  And so that's a larger discussion everybody should be having, not just me, but other talk show hosts, members of Congress, governors, attorney generals, prominent people.
[00:14:31.207 --> 00:14:42.797]  Because the political class has been in control for so long and have been handing the baton down to their bureaucrats beneath them for so long.
[00:14:44.926 --> 00:15:06.081]  That they really feel a lot of chutzpah, a lot of arrogance, a lot of humorous, a lot of bravada, a lot of machismo, whatever you want to call it, and they are going to plunge us into hell.
[00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:15.895]  And if you study history and extrapolate out, they're not going to get away with this this time, even if they go to full martial law, like Maduro's trying to do right now.
[00:15:17.255 --> 00:15:22.118]  Maduro might not be thrown out this week or next month, but the communists are on their way out in Venezuela.
[00:15:22.198 --> 00:15:26.180]  I would say within six months, the communist regime collapses.
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:33.564]  The problem is there's so much corruption and dimming out of the country, and who knows if Venezuela will ever come back.
[00:15:34.944 --> 00:15:36.025]  Most countries don't come back.
[00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:45.374]  Unless you've got really strong measures to clean up the nation like El Salvador or Chile.
[00:15:46.235 --> 00:15:49.516]  But you almost become what you're fighting when you do that.
[00:15:51.977 --> 00:16:04.763]  And that's the problem with tyrants is and tyranny and totalitarianism is that authoritarianism always leads to totalitarianism, always leads to collapse of civilization.
[00:16:07.322 --> 00:16:14.267]  And there comes a time when normal measures of just working through the system don't work anymore.
[00:16:15.227 --> 00:16:23.172]  And I have tirelessly tried and worked to try to have peace and reconciliation, and we've had a lot of success.
[00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:26.114]  And that's one reason the system has tried to dampen this broadcast.
[00:16:26.154 --> 00:16:30.597]  But there does come a point, and I'm not saying we've reached that point.
[00:16:30.677 --> 00:16:36.001]  In fact, I think we're far from it if they don't kill Trump or start World War III.
[00:16:37.492 --> 00:16:38.052]  We are winning.
[00:16:38.092 --> 00:16:40.714]  The problem is they will take us to that place.
[00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:45.278]  And so we then have to have a discussion about what that's going to look like.
[00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:49.981]  Not to even affect the battle space and get people ready for physical war.
[00:16:55.005 --> 00:16:59.848]  Because I'm enough of an expert on this to know that I'm not an expert and that nobody's an expert.
[00:17:00.549 --> 00:17:03.451]  And I don't kind of have the genes in me to want to play general.
[00:17:04.492 --> 00:17:06.013]  I will be
[00:17:07.518 --> 00:17:16.245]  A leader in that area is thrust upon me, but I certainly don't relish it, and I don't want it.
[00:17:17.766 --> 00:17:30.817]  And anybody that's rolling up their sleeves looking for a fight, whether they're a populist or whether they're a devil worshiper, that's the two sides, just pro-humans and anti-humans, anybody that thinks a physical war
[00:17:32.589 --> 00:17:48.919]  Is the thing we need to cleanse ourselves of the New World Order doesn't study sociology and anthropology and psychology and business and infrastructure because the human population of today is unrecognizable from the population of 1950.
[00:17:51.501 --> 00:17:56.104]  And the population of 1950 was basically unrecognizable to the population of say 1850.
[00:17:58.345 --> 00:18:00.827]  And you see this domestication and softening effect
[00:18:02.344 --> 00:18:23.799]  In overdrive, in warp speed, into what we are now, with this super complex civilization, with just-on-time deliveries, and with all the specialization in the different sectors of the economy, this sucker breaks down, according to all analysis from all the different industries.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:30.824]  I mean, if they took the fossil fuels away right now, 7 million people would die within a year.
[00:18:32.557 --> 00:18:39.280]  And that's only in the Pentagon actuaries, not counting melting down of nuclear reactors and the wars that would come in the battle for resources.
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:47.244]  Just if you cut the resources off, if you cut the fossil fuel off, between 6 and 7 million people would die within about a year.
[00:18:49.005 --> 00:18:55.389]  But there was another big Carrington event, like they had in the 1880s, that hit us now and blew out the power for a year.
[00:18:56.509 --> 00:18:59.911]  You'd have more than half the population dead, guaranteed.
[00:19:02.242 --> 00:19:07.103]  So, we're like squirrels going into winter with zero nuts.
[00:19:08.424 --> 00:19:12.425]  When we were in the Great Depression, 7 million people plus estimated starved to death in the United States alone.
[00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:18.927]  And again, more than 80% of the population was rural then, and more than half of them were self-sufficient.
[00:19:20.047 --> 00:19:29.550]  You've got 40 plus percent of the population self-sufficient, who can take care of the rest of the people, and still 77 plus million starved to death.
[00:19:31.991 --> 00:19:54.043]  So if we've got 10% that are urban, I mean, excuse me, 10% that are rural now on average, and 90% that are urban, and around half of those that are rural are self-sufficient, how is 5% going to take care of everybody during a collapse when 40% couldn't do it completely in the 10 years of the Great Depression?
[00:19:56.064 --> 00:19:57.465]  I'll say that again because I butchered it.
[00:19:58.669 --> 00:20:04.775]  Roughly, 90% of the population in 1929 was rural.
[00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:07.418]  10% was urban.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:15.046]  Today, it's upwards of 90%, though there was some exits to the country during COVID, so we're at about 85.
[00:20:16.808 --> 00:20:18.009]  So let's use that current number.
[00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:21.313]  85% of people live in urban or city areas.
[00:20:23.462 --> 00:20:27.503]  So 15% live rural, and let's say half of those are self-sufficient.
[00:20:27.523 --> 00:20:28.823]  Let's say it's 7.5%.
[00:20:30.444 --> 00:20:31.864]  So let's say it's 7.5%.
[00:20:31.904 --> 00:20:33.125]  That's actually the revised numbers.
[00:20:34.405 --> 00:20:35.305]  The numbers vary a little bit.
[00:20:35.465 --> 00:20:36.746]  You look it up, folks, that's the numbers.
[00:20:37.646 --> 00:20:41.607]  So we got 7.5% of the population that's self-sufficient.
[00:20:45.368 --> 00:20:52.510]  And you've got 90-plus percent that isn't, whether they were rural or urban.
[00:20:53.777 --> 00:20:55.158]  What is that going to look like?
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.483]  And that's what the globalists have already begun in the third world with the lockdowns.
[00:21:02.523 --> 00:21:05.485]  It wasn't the virus that killed now over 100 million people the last four years.
[00:21:07.086 --> 00:21:12.350]  It was starvation from just locking society and civilization down.
[00:21:14.431 --> 00:21:16.993]  And so I don't want to get up here with a bunch of gloom and doom.
[00:21:17.413 --> 00:21:18.394]  That's not my mission.
[00:21:19.957 --> 00:21:27.481]  But I have to tell it like it is so that the people who aren't aware know what's going on, whether you be for the globalists or against them.
[00:21:28.542 --> 00:21:49.373]  And then I just look at the average political class leader, and I ask myself, whether they're Republican or Democrat, most of them don't have a clue, especially the average globalist technician or minion or manager class, is destroying their own future, sinking their own lifeboat,
[00:21:50.854 --> 00:22:02.583]  According to any metric or actuary or yardstick, any gauge, and that's incontrovertible, and they'll tell you, well, there's too many people, we want a post-industrial world.
[00:22:02.903 --> 00:22:14.091]  Well, you can't turn off a system with eight and a half billion people and not have them go crazy and burn up and blow everything up during that process.
[00:22:14.131 --> 00:22:18.615]  There'll be giant wars, domestically, internationally, civil wars,
[00:22:19.935 --> 00:22:28.440]  Nuclear reactors in all the studies, melting down left and right, nuclear winner, and a hellscape that makes my head spin.
[00:22:29.961 --> 00:22:32.943]  But if you look at all these studies, they'll just look at one angle of it.
[00:22:33.223 --> 00:22:36.245]  And one angle of a shutdown of society is bad.
[00:22:36.565 --> 00:22:42.909]  But you add all the angles together and how they come together, I am horrified.
[00:22:43.769 --> 00:22:49.533]  Because the prospect of total collapse is right on the knife's edge of being a probability.
[00:22:52.108 --> 00:22:54.828]  About 50%, I'd say it's a 49% chance right now.
[00:22:55.549 --> 00:23:01.530]  They killed Trump, or Biden, and blame it on conservatives, any of that crap.
[00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:11.871]  And I want the government and the Pentagon to listen to me, because I know the higher-ups know this, but to the mid-level and others, if you haven't been read in on this, you better research this now.
[00:23:13.272 --> 00:23:20.393]  Because this is like giving a monkey a flamethrower and a belt of hand grenades
[00:23:21.454 --> 00:23:26.658]  And sending him in to an explosives factory.
[00:23:30.261 --> 00:23:49.518]  And you do that, and they've got the door of the munitions factory open, or the munitions dump, and they're handing a live flamethrower with the pilot flame on, they're handing him a live flamethrower, fully loaded,
[00:23:51.084 --> 00:24:01.450]  With two tanks on his back, and they're giving him a belt of hand grenades, and they're saying, go on in there.
[00:24:04.112 --> 00:24:16.639]  And I'm just sitting here watching this, because I've made these predictions, almost all of them have come true, and I'm telling you this is happening, and I just have a feeling of disgust, and of sadness.
[00:24:19.252 --> 00:24:23.814]  And you look back on history, things will be going well, you get a corrupt elite, everything goes to hell in a handbasket.
[00:24:25.094 --> 00:24:29.496]  There's wars, civil wars, collapse, but people knew how to go back and farm and come back from it.
[00:24:30.777 --> 00:24:38.800]  With all the bioweapons, and all the chemical weapons, and the nuclear weapons, and how domesticated the public is, the average person doesn't know how to fix a toilet.
[00:24:39.821 --> 00:24:41.821]  The average person does not know how to change a tire.
[00:24:41.861 --> 00:24:43.662]  The average person does not know how to grow crops.
[00:24:45.843 --> 00:24:47.724]  The average person knows how to watch television.
[00:24:49.827 --> 00:25:00.293]  And I guess that's what happens, you get industrialized society, people get decadent lazy, you get decadent lazy elites that are disconnected from reality, and then you blow yourselves up.
[00:25:00.333 --> 00:25:12.100]  I mean, again, nobody knows, at least I don't, whether Atlantis exists or not, the Mediterranean or the Atlantic Ocean, Plato,
[00:25:13.619 --> 00:25:38.474]  2200 something years ago said it did and they found a lot of cities and a lot of stuff he wrote about buried that they didn't know were there and it's just like he said so I tend to think it was there I mean how did he write up there was a big island with this advanced culture going around the world and they had a free energy source they have these big mechanical automatons is what he called them where you know people could get at them and like exoskeletons and flying ships
[00:25:39.878 --> 00:25:44.100]  And they had this big energy source and they did something with it and it blew up the whole island.
[00:25:45.621 --> 00:25:48.323]  And darkened the skies for years around the world.
[00:25:48.343 --> 00:25:49.403]  What does that sound like to you?
[00:25:50.284 --> 00:25:53.585]  Some type of free energy reaction?
[00:25:54.206 --> 00:25:54.806]  Strangelet?
[00:25:55.887 --> 00:25:56.767]  Vision fusion?
[00:25:58.588 --> 00:25:58.948]  I don't know.
[00:26:00.209 --> 00:26:07.533]  But whether that existed or not, we have now reached our Atlantean moment.
[00:26:09.215 --> 00:26:15.199]  Where we do have those powers to blow ourselves up, and it appears we are going to blow ourselves up.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:25.445]  And that's all I'm saying is, boy, it'd sure be nice to not all die, or maybe only 10% of us survive after four or five years of hell on earth.
[00:26:28.063 --> 00:26:30.044]  And that's my, you know, eat my neighbors analysis.
[00:26:30.084 --> 00:26:32.405]  Like the left wants to cut the energy off and starve the third world.
[00:26:32.445 --> 00:26:33.765]  Don't you get will collapse too?
[00:26:34.406 --> 00:26:35.226]  And then you're the wimps.
[00:26:35.246 --> 00:26:36.366]  You're the domesticated idiots.
[00:26:36.907 --> 00:26:45.290]  People like me, I may be domesticated compared to my grandfather or his dad, but I'm sure not domesticated compared to you.
[00:26:47.931 --> 00:26:49.872]  And I really thought about it, extrapolating out.
[00:26:49.912 --> 00:26:51.493]  I mean, it's a, it's a thought exercise.
[00:26:52.553 --> 00:26:54.214]  And I said it was tongue in cheek, you know, kind of a,
[00:26:56.727 --> 00:26:57.548]  Modest proposal.
[00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:59.830]  Look that up, you don't know what that is.
[00:27:01.111 --> 00:27:08.098]  But at the end of the day, if everything collapses and all this stuff's going to hell, I'm not going to commit suicide.
[00:27:08.779 --> 00:27:11.722]  I've got storable foods, I'll try to defend myself, my family, I'll try to organize.
[00:27:11.762 --> 00:27:17.428]  But at the end of the day, if my daughter was starving to death and some leftist came to my house trying to rob me,
[00:27:18.832 --> 00:27:19.052]  I would.
[00:27:19.412 --> 00:27:23.934]  I would go ahead and take them out to defend myself and I would go ahead and gut them and cut them up and eat them.
[00:27:24.274 --> 00:27:30.196]  So if that's where you guys want to go, all right, you put yourself in this position, but I will eat your ass.
[00:27:30.216 --> 00:27:30.836]  You understand that?
[00:27:31.196 --> 00:27:32.377]  Before me and my family die.
[00:27:33.117 --> 00:27:33.417]  You will.
[00:27:34.037 --> 00:27:34.457]  You will die.
[00:27:34.818 --> 00:27:40.141]  So, there's the Infowars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[00:27:40.281 --> 00:27:47.646]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's saw palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[00:27:48.087 --> 00:27:51.729]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:53.070]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[00:27:53.090 --> 00:28:03.137]  You need to go to infowarsstore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, Infowars MD.
[00:28:04.897 --> 00:28:06.798]  So I'm trying to get people's attention here.
[00:28:07.538 --> 00:28:09.578]  Most of the world lives in incredible poverty.
[00:28:09.738 --> 00:28:12.618]  There are revolutions and wars going on all over the planet.
[00:28:13.579 --> 00:28:18.620]  Much of Latin America is engulfed in just poverty and tyranny.
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.400]  So is Africa.
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:20.940]  Much of the Middle East.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.220]  Europe is collapsing.
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.581]  The United States is falling apart.
[00:28:25.181 --> 00:28:26.361]  Our debts are out of control.
[00:28:26.381 --> 00:28:29.241]  And again, I don't say all this to be a buzzkill.
[00:28:29.321 --> 00:28:32.162]  I say it to say we got to turn this thing around.
[00:28:32.202 --> 00:28:33.122]  I mean, take Venezuela.
[00:28:34.448 --> 00:28:36.289]  The public's been taking over government buildings.
[00:28:36.329 --> 00:28:37.950]  They've been routing the military.
[00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:39.251]  The military's been joining them.
[00:28:39.371 --> 00:28:47.175]  Maduro desperately is trying to send his special operations people to arrest the opposition leaders that reportedly got over 60-plus percent of the vote.
[00:28:48.255 --> 00:28:49.676]  Maduro got 30-something percent.
[00:28:50.437 --> 00:28:51.557]  They got, what, 63?
[00:28:51.617 --> 00:28:53.218]  He got 30-something.
[00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:55.619]  And those numbers have come out.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.942]  And so, we sit here and we look at Venezuela and we say, well, that's Venezuela.
[00:29:01.563 --> 00:29:03.924]  What would this country look like under Kamala Harris?
[00:29:05.216 --> 00:29:09.318]  What would this country look like if they would have been able to kill Trump 18 days ago?
[00:29:11.559 --> 00:29:14.500]  And you're like, well, I'm not gonna go out and riot or kill anybody if they kill Trump.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:27.687]  Well, neither am I. But the globalists will supply the violence to get us into this position because they feel insulated because they have bureaucratic control.
[00:29:27.707 --> 00:29:30.528]  It's like when you saw the former Secret Service head testify and
[00:29:31.647 --> 00:29:34.408]  The interim head, and it was all a bunch of CYA.
[00:29:35.049 --> 00:29:36.690]  Cover your patootie.
[00:29:38.831 --> 00:29:42.693]  So, Venezuela's Maduro sends tactical police to arrest opposition leaders.
[00:29:42.853 --> 00:29:57.301]  A report by Gateway Hispanic breaks down the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is arresting his political opposition after the nation's recent election results being questioned have led to skirmishes that could turn into all-out civil war.
[00:29:57.861 --> 00:29:58.702]  I'd say it already is.
[00:29:59.653 --> 00:30:02.015]  The article breaks all of that down.
[00:30:03.576 --> 00:30:11.061]  So, you expand on that with what's happening in the Middle East with Israel killing the political leader of Hamas.
[00:30:11.081 --> 00:30:16.665]  You can say, great, bombing him in his home in Tehran, Iran, where they direct the war from there.
[00:30:17.266 --> 00:30:23.890]  Why did Biden give $6 billion a month before, two months before, to the Iranians to give to Hezbollah and Hamas?
[00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:25.952]  Why did Israel stand down?
[00:30:25.972 --> 00:30:27.413]  You know, there's something bigger here.
[00:30:28.632 --> 00:30:29.372]  So let's get it straight.
[00:30:29.472 --> 00:30:33.995]  I don't trust Benjamin Netanyahu and what he's up to, and I don't trust the Iranians.
[00:30:35.735 --> 00:30:37.476]  And all of this is getting out of control.
[00:30:37.857 --> 00:30:42.319]  Hamas leader assassinated in Iran by Israeli strike.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:55.045]  And now the attacks against Israel from the north, from the east, and from the south are intensifying.
[00:30:57.918 --> 00:30:59.178]  Why did Israel found Hamas?
[00:30:59.198 --> 00:31:02.219]  Well, they admitted why they did in the 70s and in the 90s.
[00:31:03.119 --> 00:31:04.440]  And yet, Yahoo has talked about it.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:13.522]  To destabilize the Palestinian Authority, to have radicals that were violent so that you wouldn't have Muslims in suits and ties demanding their rights.
[00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:20.264]  You would just have a military conflict, which is the same rule that the globalists want here because they politically lost.
[00:31:20.324 --> 00:31:22.145]  It's the same system.
[00:31:23.653 --> 00:31:26.976]  Over and over and over again.
[00:31:27.256 --> 00:31:38.005]  So I don't like where we are, but if you're at a place, and you don't admit you're at that place, and you live in denial, you have no chance of turning that around.
[00:31:38.685 --> 00:31:42.208]  James O'Keefe is joining us, coming up here in just a little while.
[00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:44.370]  We'll be drilling through all of this.
[00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:45.811]  Roger Stone coming up in the next hour.
[00:31:46.451 --> 00:31:47.692]  Secret Service Agent Warrens.
[00:31:48.897 --> 00:31:50.638]  Of mass assassination attempts.
[00:31:50.798 --> 00:31:53.960]  Very important articles up on InfoWars.com.
[00:31:54.301 --> 00:32:01.085]  Says there's no way that they're not going to try to kill him again and that the Secret Service knows exactly what they're doing.
[00:32:02.106 --> 00:32:06.109]  We'll be going over all of that.
[00:32:08.891 --> 00:32:13.634]  Now, this broadcast is Lister-supported.
[00:32:14.814 --> 00:32:16.596]  We try to bring you things that enrich your life.
[00:32:17.779 --> 00:32:19.980]  So that you get a great response from it, you want to get it again.
[00:32:20.341 --> 00:32:26.785]  And we have a great line of amazing high-quality products at InfoWarsStore.com called the InfoWars MD line.
[00:32:28.326 --> 00:32:40.354]  And we just discovered two years ago that one of the main suppliers of the companies we were using, that are also big companies, of the raw materials for things like bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, was this company.
[00:32:40.374 --> 00:32:43.656]  And they said, hey, keep selling your products, that's great, but you get your product from us anyways.
[00:32:44.864 --> 00:32:54.928]  We can private label at our factory for you, put your label on our stuff, give people a discount, and that way, if you have supplies to chain issues, which we were having, we have got it for you.
[00:32:56.369 --> 00:32:58.870]  Well, that's what InfoWars MD is.
[00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:06.233]  The probiotic formula, the prebiotic formula, the good night's sleep, the Nerve Renew, the Joint Relief Max is an amazing natural
[00:33:07.335 --> 00:33:20.739]  Pain reliever, the ashwagandha and black pepper, the ashwagandha gummies, the prostate support, and of course, the turmeric 95 is 95% turmeric.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.060]  It's a concentrate.
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:29.162]  Normal turmeric's 4% to 5%, works great for your whole body's inflammation, for your heart, your lungs, your joints, your bones.
[00:33:30.042 --> 00:33:34.424]  But turmeric 95, remember I told you, I said we have the strongest turmeric in the country.
[00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:36.331]  Last five years, we did.
[00:33:36.351 --> 00:33:37.932]  And it was these guys that made it.
[00:33:37.952 --> 00:33:42.355]  They had decided to make their own, watching us demand even a higher concentration.
[00:33:43.496 --> 00:33:55.545]  And so, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is sold out right now at InfoWarsTore.com, and it is the same 95% turmeric, a little bit different formula over the other goodies they add to it.
[00:33:57.073 --> 00:33:58.214]  But it's all apples and oranges.
[00:33:58.274 --> 00:33:58.955]  It works great.
[00:33:59.315 --> 00:34:06.862]  Tumeric95, InfoWarsMD, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:34:07.203 --> 00:34:11.747]  We're selling out of the X2, the X3, and if we get shut down, that'll never be available again.
[00:34:11.767 --> 00:34:13.088]  But everything we have is in stock.
[00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:17.432]  And I'll have updates on the future of InfoWars soon.
[00:34:17.712 --> 00:34:22.337]  We've got a minimum of two months, maybe four or five months.
[00:34:23.891 --> 00:34:28.436]  And I've learned some major developments on that front that I'm not at liberty to talk about yet, but I will soon.
[00:34:28.496 --> 00:34:29.317]  Big breaking news.
[00:34:30.158 --> 00:34:32.400]  The deep state's out in the open, wanting this place shut down.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.882]  You already saw that in the last seven weeks.
[00:34:34.242 --> 00:34:36.024]  But we've got new intel that's incredible.
[00:34:37.546 --> 00:34:40.829]  But I've been asked to not talk about it at this point yet, but it is unbelievable.
[00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:43.793]  But it's believable, I guess, in this climate we're in.
[00:34:45.462 --> 00:35:00.891]  Separately, we have another great sponsor, drjonesnaturals.com, all the nano silver products, amazing one-of-a-kind products like next level foundational energy that isn't a stimulant but has that effect but don't let down because it unleashes the power of the cells with these key known compounds.
[00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:03.931]  Like methylfolate and more.
[00:35:04.492 --> 00:35:06.493]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:35:06.533 --> 00:35:07.514]  Be sure and check that out.
[00:35:08.234 --> 00:35:10.256]  And then separately, this is not our t-shirt.
[00:35:10.796 --> 00:35:12.878]  Our t-shirt's great, and it's here, it's now shipping.
[00:35:13.558 --> 00:35:18.782]  The bulletproof shirt with the iconic Trump raised fist.
[00:35:18.802 --> 00:35:19.883]  Anyone want to support the broadcast?
[00:35:19.903 --> 00:35:20.683]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:35:21.544 --> 00:35:23.305]  That's why it's $29, so we can get funds.
[00:35:24.426 --> 00:35:26.708]  It's a high-quality shirt, costs like 10 or 11 bucks to print.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:32.881]  But if you want to get the Hold the Line Never Surrender shirt, it's holdtheline.com.
[00:35:33.281 --> 00:35:38.363]  They're one of the top Trump Patriot apparel producers in the country, and they have got on-demand printing.
[00:35:38.823 --> 00:35:40.623]  So when you order, it ships right out.
[00:35:40.783 --> 00:35:42.224]  They got factories in Arkansas.
[00:35:43.064 --> 00:35:49.086]  So if you want the new Hold the Line shirt, it says Never Surrender on the front.
[00:35:51.706 --> 00:35:52.467]  It's a color shirt.
[00:35:52.507 --> 00:35:53.267]  It's a beautiful shirt.
[00:35:54.232 --> 00:35:58.296]  And on the back, it says the answer to 1984 is 1776 in my signature.
[00:35:58.316 --> 00:35:59.498]  It is a limited edition shirt.
[00:36:00.198 --> 00:36:01.340]  HoldTheLine.com.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:02.921]  I cut a promo on it.
[00:36:02.941 --> 00:36:03.482]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:36:04.683 --> 00:36:05.644]  Take a look at what happened.
[00:36:11.801 --> 00:36:19.006]  On July 13th, 2024, the Deep State took a shot, not just at Donald Trump, but at America and our Republic.
[00:36:19.146 --> 00:36:24.450]  But by the grace of God, God's hand was on Donald Trump, and by just millimeters, he survived.
[00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:31.095]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Deep State, Google, all the big tech companies, other than X, have been trying to suppress this image.
[00:36:31.115 --> 00:36:33.797]  They've been trying to suppress everything about the assassination.
[00:36:34.237 --> 00:36:35.458]  But it is so important
[00:36:35.718 --> 00:36:35.898]  I think?
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:03.904]  Patriot Apparel makers in America and they partnered with us and they print the shirts and everything right there in Arkansas.
[00:37:04.164 --> 00:37:06.685]  So these are ready to ship right now.
[00:37:17.014 --> 00:37:23.299]  President Trump had eight shots fired at him, killing one man, critically wounding two others, and grazing his ear.
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:32.687]  He immediately popped back up and said, fight, fight, fight, which translates to never surrender, never back down, never give up.
[00:37:33.068 --> 00:37:39.153]  But it takes the exercise of free speech and the financial support in a fight to save our republic.
[00:37:39.173 --> 00:37:40.534]  And Infowars is recognized
[00:37:40.934 --> 00:37:41.875]  That's the tip of the spear.
[00:37:42.195 --> 00:37:45.598]  And right now we are in a funding crisis and need your support.
[00:37:45.858 --> 00:37:46.939]  So I have a 360 win.
[00:37:47.379 --> 00:37:57.487]  Get this amazing Never Surrender Trump Fight Fight Fight shirt with the answer to 1984, 1776, and my signature on the back, a historic memento.
[00:37:58.187 --> 00:38:03.290]  And wear it proudly in public, and you'll probably get what I've experienced, 95% love.
[00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:08.933]  You may have some leftists try to physically attack you as well, but it's an adventure to wear this shirt.
[00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:11.135]  I've been wearing it out in public, and it's been amazing.
[00:38:11.195 --> 00:38:19.339]  And you really see the grassroots support that President Trump has around the country, not just in red cities, red towns, and red states.
[00:38:19.739 --> 00:38:25.783]  So ladies and gentlemen, this is a critical juncture for the Republic, and now is the time to wear our colors loud and proud.
[00:38:26.083 --> 00:38:27.104]  The red, white, and blue.
[00:38:27.824 --> 00:38:30.866]  With President Trump raising his fists defiantly to the New World Order.
[00:38:30.886 --> 00:38:35.649]  Go to HoldTheLine.com and use promo code Alex and you get an additional 10% off.
[00:38:35.969 --> 00:38:46.456]  By wearing this shirt in public, you raise your fists in defiance with President Trump and myself and many others for the globalist tyranny and say, we will never surrender the New World Order.
[00:38:46.937 --> 00:38:49.518]  And the answer to your tyranny is 1776.
[00:38:50.619 --> 00:38:51.720]  We will never surrender.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.561]  We will fight, fight, fight!
[00:38:53.841 --> 00:38:54.762]  Because the answer to 1984 is 1776!
[00:39:06.131 --> 00:39:06.771]  We're fighting.
[00:39:07.772 --> 00:39:08.493]  We need your help.
[00:39:09.213 --> 00:39:10.514]  It's an amazing, beautiful shirt.
[00:39:12.196 --> 00:39:13.236]  HoldTheLine.com.
[00:39:13.357 --> 00:39:14.778]  Promo code Alex for a big discount.
[00:39:16.239 --> 00:39:17.720]  Promo code Alex at HoldTheLine.com.
[00:39:19.121 --> 00:39:20.763]  And you can get our shirt that's just as good.
[00:39:20.783 --> 00:39:22.504]  I'm proud of it at m4restore.com.
[00:39:22.544 --> 00:39:23.385]  Okay, I'm done plugging.
[00:39:23.425 --> 00:39:24.686]  It takes money to fight the New World Order.
[00:39:26.246 --> 00:39:26.947]  We're in a war.
[00:39:27.107 --> 00:39:28.469]  We appreciate your support.
[00:39:28.509 --> 00:39:30.170]  Humbly ask for your further support.
[00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:32.093]  Ask those that have been sitting on the fence, what are you doing?
[00:39:32.213 --> 00:39:33.094]  Please get off the fence.
[00:39:33.154 --> 00:39:34.615]  Go to HoldTheLine.com right now.
[00:39:34.776 --> 00:39:34.996]  Okay.
[00:39:37.267 --> 00:39:38.268]  James O'Keefe's a little late.
[00:39:38.308 --> 00:39:40.570]  He's pulling in, they say, to his studio right now.
[00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:41.390]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:39:42.711 --> 00:39:44.072]  He sent me a nice message last night.
[00:39:44.112 --> 00:39:45.253]  He said, hey, why don't you come on the show?
[00:39:46.134 --> 00:39:48.736]  Because it's not just about all the big stories he's breaking.
[00:39:48.756 --> 00:39:49.437]  We'll hit some of those.
[00:39:49.997 --> 00:39:55.661]  It's also about Project Veritas getting Pfizer pressure and control and canning him when he was the founder.
[00:39:55.681 --> 00:39:57.083]  And they really, I think, did it illegally.
[00:39:57.843 --> 00:40:00.445]  And then in court, they've been trying to silence him and take him off the air.
[00:40:01.106 --> 00:40:02.527]  And he just defeated them yesterday.
[00:40:02.567 --> 00:40:03.928]  And it's the same thing I've gone through.
[00:40:04.508 --> 00:40:06.310]  They want to get all the major voices off the air.
[00:40:07.802 --> 00:40:09.966]  Steve Bannon is in prison right now.
[00:40:10.446 --> 00:40:11.288]  Owen went to prison.
[00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:13.471]  They tried to put me in prison.
[00:40:14.092 --> 00:40:15.094]  Navarro was in prison.
[00:40:15.114 --> 00:40:16.316]  They're trying to put Trump in prison.
[00:40:16.797 --> 00:40:17.959]  This is serious stuff.
[00:40:18.259 --> 00:40:20.182]  Here's James O'Keefe coming out of the courthouse yesterday.
[00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:30.760]  I've just been issued in federal court in the case of Project Veritas suing me, asking the court to issue a preliminary injunction against me.
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:37.608]  The federal judge just now issuing a directed verdict against Project Veritas and in my favor.
[00:40:37.989 --> 00:40:40.672]  Yesterday, I was asked to do a deal.
[00:40:41.232 --> 00:40:44.614]  There was a deal on the table to limit my speech.
[00:40:44.834 --> 00:40:45.574]  I said no.
[00:40:45.614 --> 00:40:47.395]  They immediately called me to testify.
[00:40:47.415 --> 00:40:53.698]  I testified for a couple hours and just now, just now, ruling in our favor.
[00:40:53.718 --> 00:41:03.043]  It remains unclear why Project Veritas is continuing on, why they're using donor resources to shut me up and shut me down, but I will never be shut up or shut down.
[00:41:03.063 --> 00:41:06.225]  I will not agree to any deal that restricts my First Amendment rights.
[00:41:06.965 --> 00:41:08.046]  We have won today.
[00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:13.521]  And we're releasing a story inside the DNC this afternoon.
[00:41:14.661 --> 00:41:26.586]  Three years ago, I told you that at a mediation in Connecticut, the head of the Koskoff law firm, Democrat Party operative, said, we are the mafia, like in the movie, The Godfather.
[00:41:26.746 --> 00:41:27.566]  We're going to beat you.
[00:41:28.207 --> 00:41:29.567]  And we don't we don't want money.
[00:41:29.587 --> 00:41:31.228]  We want, you know, to shut you down and laughed at me.
[00:41:32.429 --> 00:41:34.991]  And then I couldn't talk about it because I was in a mediation, but later they admitted it.
[00:41:35.451 --> 00:41:37.573]  They admitted it on the courthouse steps in Texas and Connecticut.
[00:41:38.153 --> 00:41:40.835]  And then in the last almost seven weeks, they tried to shut us down.
[00:41:41.235 --> 00:41:41.956]  At first, they denied.
[00:41:41.976 --> 00:41:43.457]  They later said, yeah, we do want him shut down.
[00:41:43.757 --> 00:41:44.818]  They filed to shut us down.
[00:41:45.538 --> 00:41:46.699]  They said, we don't want any settlement.
[00:41:46.719 --> 00:41:47.299]  We don't want money.
[00:41:47.319 --> 00:41:48.120]  We want him off the air.
[00:41:49.121 --> 00:41:51.442]  And the federal judge three weeks ago, four weeks ago, said, you're crazy.
[00:41:51.502 --> 00:41:51.983]  I'm not doing it.
[00:41:53.784 --> 00:41:54.804]  And so that's where we are.
[00:41:55.045 --> 00:41:58.147]  And they're behind the scenes with the court right now.
[00:42:00.529 --> 00:42:05.131]  Trying to block having a buyer come in and buy the assets of Infowars to keep us on the air.
[00:42:05.731 --> 00:42:10.373]  And most experts believe that's illegal or it's not lawful, you can't do it.
[00:42:10.433 --> 00:42:13.294]  But they want us off the air, folks.
[00:42:13.314 --> 00:42:14.295]  They want everybody off the air.
[00:42:14.315 --> 00:42:15.875]  And I know most of you are like, yeah, we already know that.
[00:42:16.395 --> 00:42:18.136]  The point is, that's how real this is.
[00:42:18.156 --> 00:42:22.498]  You have the CIA and the FBI admitting they were behind the whole thing.
[00:42:23.402 --> 00:42:26.983]  So, they are so desperate, and again, it's not about me.
[00:42:27.124 --> 00:42:32.386]  They wouldn't be this desperate to get everybody off the air or in prison if they weren't getting ready to make a big move.
[00:42:32.406 --> 00:42:39.008]  When they tried to shut us down six-plus weeks ago without a court order, and I said, no, you're not, and the judge slapped them down.
[00:42:39.869 --> 00:42:45.811]  Think of the desperateness of these guys with the federal agents they had, the court-appointed U.S.
[00:42:45.851 --> 00:42:48.292]  trustee, and the CRO, who the judge then fired.
[00:42:49.592 --> 00:42:53.315]  They feel so emboldened because they're working with the Justice Department.
[00:42:53.335 --> 00:42:54.155]  They admit this.
[00:42:55.496 --> 00:42:56.216]  And it's illegal.
[00:42:57.477 --> 00:42:59.439]  So it is a coup against your free speech.
[00:43:00.179 --> 00:43:01.700]  It is a coup against this republic.
[00:43:02.661 --> 00:43:05.162]  And it is beyond dangerous.
[00:43:06.543 --> 00:43:13.688]  And it lets you know the wheelhouse that we are all in right now.
[00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:18.271]  And it's time for the general public to get off the fence.
[00:43:19.249 --> 00:43:24.435]  It's time for the attorney generals around the country, they're starting to do this, to take action against this unconstitutional behavior.
[00:43:25.376 --> 00:43:33.364]  Because this is the exact same crap they're pulling in Venezuela, and they're pulling in Brazil against their populist conservative Christian opposition.
[00:43:33.404 --> 00:43:38.890]  The people want freedom, they want security, they want justice, they want sovereignty.
[00:43:39.923 --> 00:43:41.204]  But they've not been getting it.
[00:43:41.224 --> 00:43:42.024]  They've been getting tyranny.
[00:43:42.964 --> 00:43:45.165]  And the tyrant's answer is to squeeze tighter.
[00:43:45.805 --> 00:43:46.586]  And attack more.
[00:43:47.406 --> 00:43:49.767]  And just go after people more and more and more.
[00:43:50.087 --> 00:43:51.808]  But you see, Biden's rallies, nobody's at them.
[00:43:52.368 --> 00:43:54.549]  Kamala Harris can't get anybody in her rallies the last few weeks.
[00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:56.530]  So, literally like 67 people show up.
[00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:02.112]  So then she puts on free hip-hop concerts with high-level, very popular musicians.
[00:44:02.892 --> 00:44:04.913]  And then, you know, 15,000 people show up.
[00:44:04.973 --> 00:44:08.795]  And as soon as the concert's over, and Kamala walks out, everybody gets up and leaves.
[00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:12.952]  Because she has no excitement.
[00:44:13.012 --> 00:44:13.993]  She has no backing.
[00:44:14.033 --> 00:44:15.293]  She got less than 2%.
[00:44:15.733 --> 00:44:19.775]  It was like 1.8% in the polls when she ran against Biden.
[00:44:20.155 --> 00:44:23.357]  Remember that for the nomination in 2020.
[00:44:26.898 --> 00:44:36.523]  But then the corporate media spends all its time telling you that she's surging in the polls and she's really popular and all the rest is crap.
[00:44:36.683 --> 00:44:37.183]  No, she's not.
[00:44:37.743 --> 00:44:39.024]  So let's play some of these clips here.
[00:44:42.967 --> 00:44:49.312]  Let's play a footage of Megan Thee Stallion performing before Kamala's speech in Atlanta.
[00:44:50.653 --> 00:44:55.357]  Then crowd leaves after she speaks.
[00:44:56.318 --> 00:44:58.499]  I mean, after the music was over.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:03.984]  And then I want to look at some of the things Kamala's actually been supporting and what she's been pushing.
[00:45:04.584 --> 00:45:08.427]  Clip 1 and 3 where she wants to confiscate guns and it's a great idea.
[00:45:08.707 --> 00:45:09.328]  Here are those clips.
[00:45:16.487 --> 00:45:16.687]  Huh?
[00:45:16.767 --> 00:45:24.229]  What we talking about over here, y'all?
[00:45:45.668 --> 00:45:57.893]  Do you believe in the mandatory buyback of quote-unquote assault weapons?
[00:45:58.153 --> 00:46:02.235]  And whether or not you do, how does that idea not go against fundamentally the Second Amendment?
[00:46:02.655 --> 00:46:04.655]  Yeah, great question.
[00:46:04.936 --> 00:46:07.036]  I do believe that we need to do buybacks.
[00:46:07.156 --> 00:46:09.657]  A buyback program is a good idea.
[00:46:09.977 --> 00:46:11.298]  Now we need to do it the right way.
[00:46:12.173 --> 00:46:17.599]  And part of that has to be, you know, buy back and give people their value, the financial value.
[00:46:17.619 --> 00:46:19.041]  Adding to your bank control agenda?
[00:46:19.061 --> 00:46:24.347]  Yeah, I think it's a great idea, but I mean, listen, I don't think we lack for great ideas.
[00:46:24.387 --> 00:46:28.312]  As I've said many times, we've been having great ideas for decades.
[00:46:28.692 --> 00:46:31.314]  The problem is that Congress does not have the courage to act.
[00:46:32.134 --> 00:46:42.802]  And that is why, from the beginning I have said, my agenda includes attempting to get Congress to act, but if they don't within the first hundred days of my administration, I'm going to take executive action.
[00:46:42.862 --> 00:46:44.323]  Because what we need is action.
[00:46:45.063 --> 00:46:45.504]  Hell yeah!
[00:46:46.437 --> 00:46:47.457]  All right, we already played the clip.
[00:46:47.497 --> 00:46:48.718]  James O'Keefe joins us now.
[00:46:48.738 --> 00:46:52.139]  A big victory in his fight for free speech.
[00:46:52.179 --> 00:46:55.460]  Project Veritas and the group that took it over trying to silence him.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.201]  Absolutely disgusting in that failed coup we saw.
[00:46:58.621 --> 00:47:00.582]  They're trying to silence us, trying to silence Trump.
[00:47:01.082 --> 00:47:02.503]  Steve Bannon, the list goes on and on.
[00:47:02.523 --> 00:47:04.863]  Of course, he's roared back to greater success than ever.
[00:47:05.224 --> 00:47:05.964]  James O'Keefe.
[00:47:06.624 --> 00:47:10.586]  The third on X, O'Keefe Media, O'Keefe Media Group dot com.
[00:47:11.026 --> 00:47:16.669]  James, giving us a quick update on the attempts to silence you and then also some of the big stories you're working on.
[00:47:16.689 --> 00:47:17.829]  And then I haven't talked to you in a while.
[00:47:17.849 --> 00:47:20.610]  I also want to get your take on their attempt at assassination of Trump.
[00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:21.291]  So good to see you.
[00:47:21.691 --> 00:47:22.411]  Where do you want to start?
[00:47:23.292 --> 00:47:25.032]  Hey, Alex, it's great to see you again.
[00:47:25.072 --> 00:47:26.353]  And thank you for having me on today.
[00:47:26.393 --> 00:47:30.435]  And I saw your response on X yesterday to my courtroom victory.
[00:47:31.252 --> 00:47:33.913]  And you and Elon are asking, what's behind this?
[00:47:34.013 --> 00:47:34.933]  Who's funding this?
[00:47:34.953 --> 00:47:42.055]  And I've been asking that question for a long time here because 18 months ago, I was fired from the organization I founded, Alex.
[00:47:42.115 --> 00:47:51.937]  And it's not unusual for entrepreneurs or people who, you know, create things to be, you know, whether they do it to Elon or Steve Jobs or much bigger people than me, but it is confusing.
[00:47:51.957 --> 00:47:58.119]  18 months later, they're trying to go to a federal judge and get the judge to issue an injunction to shut me down.
[00:47:59.003 --> 00:48:05.872]  And I they offered me a deal, Alex, on Monday, and part of that deal was to not talk about it.
[00:48:06.679 --> 00:48:10.560]  And I was thinking about doing that only because I couldn't take the pain and abuse anymore.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:16.062]  But at the very last second, I decided I can't live with myself compromising on my values.
[00:48:16.082 --> 00:48:17.962]  And they immediately called me up to testify.
[00:48:17.982 --> 00:48:19.162]  I did that for a few hours.
[00:48:19.923 --> 00:48:23.964]  And then the judge issued a verdict ruling yesterday, dismissing it.
[00:48:23.984 --> 00:48:25.504]  And it was a big victory.
[00:48:29.245 --> 00:48:33.606]  But it does remain confusing why they're trying to still shut me down.
[00:48:33.766 --> 00:48:37.406]  I know you know a lot about people trying to shut you down, but that's the update there.
[00:48:37.987 --> 00:48:38.647]  Well, it's huge.
[00:48:39.087 --> 00:48:40.467]  And what is their weird excuse?
[00:48:40.507 --> 00:48:51.329]  It's one thing to hijack your company, your organization, your journalistic operation that's so storied and renowned, but it's another thing to then claim you as a person can't continue to be a journalist.
[00:48:52.429 --> 00:48:53.389]  I mean, talk about arrogance.
[00:48:53.489 --> 00:48:54.570]  And so that's one question.
[00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:56.730]  Secondarily, have you found out who's behind them?
[00:48:58.126 --> 00:48:58.846]  No, I haven't.
[00:48:59.447 --> 00:49:04.550]  And they're pursuing this bizarre legal theory of trade secrets.
[00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:11.054]  Of course, anybody can be a journalist, and I think that they should do what they do, and I should do what we do, and we could all continue onward.
[00:49:11.587 --> 00:49:12.348]  It's very bizarre.
[00:49:12.488 --> 00:49:17.215]  It doesn't make any sense, but you know, Alex, nothing seems to make sense anymore in this crazy world of ours.
[00:49:17.675 --> 00:49:19.438]  We're living in a very irrational time.
[00:49:19.959 --> 00:49:26.367]  You asked me, and you're showing some videos there, they're issuing subpoenas to me, subpoenas to my staff, but great job to my team.
[00:49:26.387 --> 00:49:28.050]  And you know, I'm very fortunate, Alex, because
[00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:30.151]  I think I'm in a better place now.
[00:49:30.171 --> 00:49:31.311]  I've got good people around me.
[00:49:31.811 --> 00:49:33.352]  And sometimes you need to be liberated.
[00:49:33.392 --> 00:49:34.793]  You need to be fully independent.
[00:49:35.413 --> 00:49:36.754]  You asked about the assassination.
[00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:38.074]  My thoughts are as follows.
[00:49:39.075 --> 00:49:43.536]  You know, I think there's going to be a series of black swan events between now and the election.
[00:49:43.576 --> 00:49:45.757]  The day before that happened, someone said, what do you think?
[00:49:45.817 --> 00:49:47.118]  Everyone's always trying to predict the future.
[00:49:47.178 --> 00:49:49.079]  I said, listen, all bets are off.
[00:49:49.259 --> 00:49:50.499]  Something crazy is going to happen.
[00:49:50.539 --> 00:49:51.500]  We don't know what it is.
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:55.185]  So I think what's going to happen is more crazy things.
[00:49:55.506 --> 00:49:56.587]  Black Swan events.
[00:49:56.668 --> 00:50:00.053]  At least two of them will happen before Election Day that will throw everything into a state of flux.
[00:50:00.674 --> 00:50:06.083]  And the third update for you is we have insiders inside the DNC and ActBlue.
[00:50:06.713 --> 00:50:14.558]  And yesterday released part one of a story featuring the Democratic National Committee compliance manager talking what they really think about Kamala.
[00:50:14.799 --> 00:50:26.767]  Not shocking to you or I, but it is interesting to hear their own legal people, the compliance manager, saying that Kamala has, quote, no accomplishments and nobody likes her and saying all these things about Kamala.
[00:50:26.827 --> 00:50:32.851]  So that's very interesting to us and shows that perhaps, perhaps they will replace her or she's not the right person for the ticket.
[00:50:33.251 --> 00:50:37.493]  Well, that's what Roger Stone's been saying is that they plan to replace her or use some scandal.
[00:50:38.073 --> 00:50:39.414]  It might be too late for that.
[00:50:39.474 --> 00:50:42.255]  But of course, I have seen that report.
[00:50:42.455 --> 00:50:43.435]  More is coming out on that.
[00:50:43.475 --> 00:50:50.098]  But for people that just tuned in, give us a nutshell of what you guys were able to catch undercover.
[00:50:50.717 --> 00:50:55.780]  This is the DNC compliance manager, Joyce Desirs is their name.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:51:03.505]  He, him, very bizarre individual, runs the compliance department there at the DNC, all things accounting and legal.
[00:51:03.945 --> 00:51:09.489]  And he says, this is very interesting, Alex, that it's very rare you get someone at this high level to be so honest.
[00:51:09.529 --> 00:51:11.430]  He says, well, we just tell donors what they want to hear.
[00:51:11.951 --> 00:51:13.792]  He says, we play into donors' fantasies.
[00:51:14.926 --> 00:51:20.229]  We just bamboozled them by saying the things that play into their fantasies.
[00:51:21.149 --> 00:51:32.015]  And he says Kamala is unlikable, that she has, quote, no accomplishments to speak of, and that their donors want them to, quote, attack Trump more.
[00:51:32.635 --> 00:51:33.957]  So, very interesting.
[00:51:33.997 --> 00:51:40.063]  It seems to suggest that there's a difference between the right thing and what their donors want them to do.
[00:51:40.163 --> 00:51:47.231]  So they're kind of torn between the extreme left or the more activist donor involvement and
[00:51:48.106 --> 00:51:50.187]  The correct path forward for the DNC.
[00:51:50.267 --> 00:51:51.047]  Very intriguing.
[00:51:51.067 --> 00:51:52.808]  Now this guy, Alex, one more thing.
[00:51:53.188 --> 00:51:59.051]  They sent a postcard to our undercover journalist trying to intimidate her from releasing this story.
[00:51:59.671 --> 00:52:04.694]  And this individual, Joyce DeSears, has since taken his ex-account down.
[00:52:05.114 --> 00:52:06.596]  So we have another part two coming out tomorrow.
[00:52:06.616 --> 00:52:07.536]  We're producing it right now.
[00:52:07.556 --> 00:52:08.117]  All right, James.
[00:52:08.177 --> 00:52:09.138]  We got you on late.
[00:52:09.198 --> 00:52:13.262]  Do five more minutes from the other side, because I want to go back into this Black Swan event you're predicting.
[00:52:13.282 --> 00:52:14.883]  We'll let you get back to your important work.
[00:52:14.923 --> 00:52:17.486]  Back with James O'Keefe with O'KeefeMediaGroup.com.
[00:52:17.606 --> 00:52:18.967]  Be sure and give all your tips there.
[00:52:19.347 --> 00:52:20.228]  We'll be right back.
[00:52:20.288 --> 00:52:20.689]  Stay with us.
[00:52:20.709 --> 00:52:21.269]  James O'Keefe.
[00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:22.671]  Take a look at what happened.
[00:52:28.829 --> 00:52:36.031]  On July 13th, 2024, the Deep State took a shot, not just at Donald Trump, but at America and our Republic.
[00:52:36.171 --> 00:52:41.472]  But by the grace of God, God's hand was on Donald Trump, and by just millimeters, he survived.
[00:52:41.732 --> 00:52:48.134]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Deep State, Google, all the big tech companies other than X, have been trying to suppress this image.
[00:52:48.154 --> 00:52:50.795]  They've been trying to suppress everything about the assassination.
[00:52:51.255 --> 00:52:59.120]  But it is so important that we support President Trump and we support the InfoWar that defends and supports Trump by getting this iconic shirt.
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:10.406]  It takes that incredible fight, fight, fight image and it says never surrender under it and on the back it says the answer to 1984 is 1776 with my signature.
[00:53:10.867 --> 00:53:12.808]  Now this is brought to you by one of the top
[00:53:13.368 --> 00:53:20.944]  Patriot Apparel makers in America and they partnered with us and they print the shirts and everything right there in Arkansas.
[00:53:21.204 --> 00:53:23.749]  So these are ready to ship right now.
[00:53:34.039 --> 00:53:40.300]  President Trump had eight shots fired at him, killing one man, critically wounding two others, and grazing his ear.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:49.702]  He immediately popped back up and said, fight, fight, fight, which translates to never surrender, never back down, never give up.
[00:53:50.082 --> 00:53:56.244]  But it takes the exercise of free speech and the financial support in a fight to save our republic.
[00:53:56.304 --> 00:53:57.544]  Infowars is recognized
[00:53:57.984 --> 00:53:58.224]  That's right.
[00:54:15.223 --> 00:54:20.305]  And wear it proudly in public, and you'll probably get, it's what I've experienced, 95% love.
[00:54:20.605 --> 00:54:25.966]  You may have some leftists try to physically attack you as well, but it's an adventure to wear this shirt.
[00:54:25.986 --> 00:54:28.147]  I've been wearing it out in public, and it's been amazing.
[00:54:28.207 --> 00:54:36.369]  And you really see the grassroots support that President Trump has around the country, not just in red cities, red towns, and red states.
[00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:42.811]  So ladies and gentlemen, this is a critical juncture for the Republic, and now is the time to wear our colors loud and proud.
[00:54:43.111 --> 00:54:44.132]  The red, white, and blue.
[00:54:44.972 --> 00:54:47.914]  President Trump raising his fists defiantly to the New World Order.
[00:54:48.234 --> 00:54:52.697]  Go to HoldTheLine.com and use promo code Alex and you get an additional 10% off.
[00:54:52.997 --> 00:55:03.504]  By wearing this shirt in public, you raise your fists in defiance with President Trump and myself and many others for the globalist tyranny and say, we will never surrender the New World Order.
[00:55:03.965 --> 00:55:06.546]  And the answer to your tyranny is 1776.
[00:55:07.647 --> 00:55:08.748]  We will never surrender.
[00:55:08.948 --> 00:55:10.609]  We will fight, fight, fight!
[00:55:10.889 --> 00:55:11.790]  Because the answer to 1984 is 1776!
[00:55:21.656 --> 00:55:27.320]  All right, five more minutes left with James O'Keefe, the O'Keefe Media Group, top journalist, investigative journalist in the world right now.
[00:55:28.981 --> 00:55:31.583]  I want you to go back into Black Swan, because I totally agree with you.
[00:55:32.512 --> 00:55:33.713]  The globalists are in full panic mode.
[00:55:33.733 --> 00:55:34.694]  They failed to kill Trump.
[00:55:35.195 --> 00:55:36.036]  I think the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:55:36.056 --> 00:55:36.816]  There's a stand-down.
[00:55:36.836 --> 00:55:38.898]  I don't know if you guys are doing any investigations into that.
[00:55:39.319 --> 00:55:42.102]  If so, let us know as soon as you're about to break it.
[00:55:42.142 --> 00:55:43.023]  We want to push it hard.
[00:55:43.063 --> 00:55:48.488]  But in the few minutes we have left, go back in and flesh that out because I really respect your analysis and your sources.
[00:55:48.868 --> 00:55:52.012]  You're saying multiple Black Swan events in the next 90-something days.
[00:55:53.833 --> 00:55:56.236]  Give us some of your ideas and what they may be planning.
[00:55:57.148 --> 00:56:16.639]  Thank you, Alex, and I appreciate your audience, because we have a lot of sources that come to us at OMG, and we've had Secret Service agents come to us, Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, and all these people are kind of on the precipice of blowing the whistle, and they're rightfully afraid, because they're going to give up their livelihood, their pension, if they say the thing that they know, but they don't want to say.
[00:56:17.319 --> 00:56:21.262]  So, Black Swan event just means, I forgot the name of the book,
[00:56:22.782 --> 00:56:24.863]  That was originally quoted as talking about that.
[00:56:24.903 --> 00:56:27.224]  But in politics, everyone wants to predict the future.
[00:56:27.504 --> 00:56:29.944]  And my point is that all bets are off.
[00:56:30.004 --> 00:56:34.026]  The day before Trump was assassinated, I was having dinner with a guy in L.A.
[00:56:34.046 --> 00:56:35.406]  and he asked me what I think is going to happen.
[00:56:35.426 --> 00:56:37.286]  I said, there's going to be a Black Swan event.
[00:56:37.326 --> 00:56:38.907]  It's going to throw the whole thing into a state of flux.
[00:56:39.107 --> 00:56:43.250]  And literally in the next week or two, Trump was shot and Biden dropped off.
[00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:46.813]  So I think you're gonna have two more things like that happen between now and November.
[00:56:46.853 --> 00:56:48.274]  And I don't know what they are.
[00:56:48.294 --> 00:56:56.401]  It could be some war, it could be a famine, it could be someone gets killed, but you're gonna see that happen and that's gonna throw everything into a state of flux.
[00:56:56.441 --> 00:56:57.642]  Therefore, all bets are off.
[00:56:57.702 --> 00:57:00.163]  And the second part of that is whistleblowers.
[00:57:01.364 --> 00:57:06.148]  I am telling you, there is an explosion of people right now on the inside.
[00:57:06.649 --> 00:57:08.070]  And I know that because they message me.
[00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:08.891]  Oh, safety net!
[00:57:27.734 --> 00:57:28.774]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:29.255 --> 00:57:33.417]  We've got to figure that out because I'm telling you, there's something happening on the inside of these institutions.
[00:57:33.757 --> 00:57:39.159]  People have a conscience, they want to do the right thing, but they're going to get their lives destroyed for saying the truth.
[00:57:39.179 --> 00:57:40.320]  So that's what I'm currently working on.
[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:41.700]  Well, I would tell them this.
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:42.861]  Look at the political climate.
[00:57:43.881 --> 00:57:46.782]  Keeping your head down, covering your asses, we're going to lose civilization.
[00:57:46.802 --> 00:57:47.603]  We're going to have nuclear war.
[00:57:47.623 --> 00:57:48.983]  We're going to have a totally collapsed country.
[00:57:49.023 --> 00:57:52.425]  So it's gotten so dangerous now they've got to do what I've done, what you've done.
[00:57:52.445 --> 00:57:54.506]  I've been on your show before and you talk about the fact that
[00:57:56.256 --> 00:57:57.458]  We put our lives on the line here.
[00:57:57.498 --> 00:57:58.500]  We're totally committed.
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:00.263]  And that's the attitude people have to have.
[00:58:00.323 --> 00:58:03.848]  And if society just gets that attitude again, then we can turn this around.
[00:58:04.932 --> 00:58:11.336]  Yeah, I met with, I was in Capitol Hill yesterday meeting with various lawmakers to figure out what the congressional protections are, the challenges.
[00:58:11.376 --> 00:58:13.357]  There aren't a lot of legislative protections.
[00:58:13.437 --> 00:58:14.417]  It's really more media.
[00:58:14.477 --> 00:58:18.260]  So, you know, OMG O'Keefe Media, we do the swiper thing.
[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:20.161]  You can go out, get paid to do stories.
[00:58:20.601 --> 00:58:24.603]  And I have Citizen Journalism Foundation, which is now tax deductible, by the way.
[00:58:24.663 --> 00:58:26.184]  Thank God the IRS gave me that.
[00:58:26.664 --> 00:58:29.466]  And we're going to start giving grants out to whistleblowers if they blow the whistle.
[00:58:29.506 --> 00:58:31.447]  If you're watching this program, and I know that you have a
[00:58:31.967 --> 00:58:35.948]  Great audience, some really good, faithful people, God-fearing people.
[00:58:36.448 --> 00:58:37.948]  And you work for one of these institutions.
[00:58:37.988 --> 00:58:40.389]  You can message us, and we will talk to you.
[00:58:40.409 --> 00:58:46.931]  We have a whole room of people right now responding to people, particularly ActBlue, Alex, is another thing.
[00:58:46.951 --> 00:58:48.671]  Yeah, give us 60 seconds.
[00:58:48.691 --> 00:58:51.492]  People follow that, but people that don't know about ActBlue, you've caught them red-handed.
[00:58:51.772 --> 00:58:52.572]  Looks like laundering money.
[00:58:53.516 --> 00:59:00.081]  FEC money, FEC data shows that people who can't afford to are giving hundreds of thousands of dollars thousands of times.
[00:59:00.701 --> 00:59:02.362]  So it appears to be a money laundering scheme.
[00:59:02.763 --> 00:59:12.910]  We believe the money is coming from Europe or Asia and through Stripe and we're trying to get to the bottom of this and we have an explosion of people including
[00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:16.512]  At least one insider inside ActBlue.
[00:59:16.552 --> 00:59:21.674]  We have a mole inside ActBlue that told me where their conference is, the names of their employees.
[00:59:21.714 --> 00:59:26.937]  So I'm just saying that it's 10 to 100 times what it was a year or two ago.
[00:59:26.957 --> 00:59:31.019]  These explosion of people on the inside, we got to nurture that.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:34.061]  It's going to require sacrifice.
[00:59:34.141 --> 00:59:42.766]  I get we're a world of people pursuing their own self-interest, but we got to find people who are willing to make sacrifices and be heroic.
[00:59:43.286 --> 00:59:43.827]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:59:43.887 --> 00:59:44.808]  We'll be right back.
[01:00:13.387 --> 01:00:20.091]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:00:20.331 --> 01:00:22.492]  You better believe you got one!
[01:00:24.633 --> 01:00:29.876]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:48.075 --> 01:00:55.842]  Joining us is longtime confidant and former chief political advisor Roger Stone of President Trump.
[01:00:57.784 --> 01:01:05.951]  And I want to talk about the attempted assassination of Trump 18 days ago and the consensus that the deep state obviously was involved.
[01:01:06.431 --> 01:01:07.432]  Bare minimum stand down.
[01:01:08.153 --> 01:01:09.173]  And we'll try again.
[01:01:09.214 --> 01:01:12.817]  We've got whistleblowers from the Secret Service and more.
[01:01:14.161 --> 01:01:16.682]  And then you've also got the fact that there's a lot of rumblings.
[01:01:16.702 --> 01:01:18.903]  They're going to try to still remove Kamala Harris.
[01:01:19.663 --> 01:01:21.624]  How will they maneuver and do that?
[01:01:22.164 --> 01:01:25.725]  Roger also has a clip, so when you direct us to play it, we will play it, Roger.
[01:01:25.785 --> 01:01:32.047]  So I'm going to give you the floor here in most of this segment to just give us your analysis.
[01:01:32.067 --> 01:01:32.948]  Then I've got my questions.
[01:01:32.988 --> 01:01:35.248]  Roger, great to have you with us at such a critical time.
[01:01:36.809 --> 01:01:39.410]  Alex, I'm very happy to be with you today.
[01:01:40.257 --> 01:01:56.168]  About a little more than four months ago, a well-known and respected Christian prophet, Robin Bullock, contacted me and told me that there would be an assassination attempt on President Donald Trump, that this was word that God had given him.
[01:01:57.209 --> 01:02:07.977]  And he said at the time that it is actually reflected in the Bible, particularly in the book of Samuel, because we're in the period, he said, of two kings.
[01:02:09.009 --> 01:02:11.792]  But he wasn't sure what to do about this information.
[01:02:11.812 --> 01:02:18.437]  He didn't know if he should contact the Secret Service or perhaps reach out with Eric Trump, who AA had met.
[01:02:18.877 --> 01:02:24.862]  We elected at that point that I would just pass the word to President Trump and let him process it.
[01:02:24.902 --> 01:02:28.745]  But it was a warning that security needed to be tighter.
[01:02:29.631 --> 01:02:32.077]  Robin Bullitt wanted no publicity.
[01:02:32.097 --> 01:02:35.384]  This was not about how I predicted it.
[01:02:35.444 --> 01:02:37.789]  There was nothing selfish about this.
[01:02:37.809 --> 01:02:39.994]  It was an entirely selfless act.
[01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:53.860]  Now, he has come forward in a very powerful video to explain exactly what he meant and why the events that we're seeing now are foreshadowed in the Bible.
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:57.800]  So, normally, Alex, I come to you for a political discussion.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.221]  We've got time for that, certainly.
[01:02:59.281 --> 01:03:04.342]  But this very powerful video, I think, is something that folks need to see.
[01:03:04.362 --> 01:03:05.122]  Let's take a look.
[01:03:11.934 --> 01:03:13.335]  Well, we're going to go back to that clip in a moment.
[01:03:13.375 --> 01:03:14.335]  He needed to introduce it.
[01:03:14.355 --> 01:03:15.576]  I think that's where there was some confusion.
[01:03:16.177 --> 01:03:20.459]  Roger, elaborating on this, you were telling me that this is an exclusive video, right?
[01:03:21.039 --> 01:03:21.700]  You're breaking this down.
[01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:25.227]  This has not yet aired anyplace.
[01:03:25.787 --> 01:03:30.891]  This will air tonight on The Stone Zone, but nobody has seen this previously.
[01:03:31.211 --> 01:03:33.873]  And we're going to play in a moment, but tell us a little bit more about this gentleman.
[01:03:34.634 --> 01:03:42.780]  Is he the fellow, I saw him, they've confirmed the video is from about six months ago that he saw Trump's ear being grazed?
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:43.941]  Have you seen that pastor?
[01:03:47.490 --> 01:04:11.572]  He does discuss this in the video, but this is very specifically a reference to the fact that Saul, who was one of the two kings, was the illegitimate king, in this case Saul is Biden, tries to kill David, who is the legitimate king, but narrowly misses him just as he used a javelin, the shooter in Butler used a bullet.
[01:04:12.532 --> 01:04:18.336]  Election, pardon me, assassination deniers is a whole different problem we'll talk about in a moment.
[01:04:18.576 --> 01:04:29.562]  But in this particular case, I think he makes the biblical case as to why and how he foresaw all of this, how God's word got to him.
[01:04:30.602 --> 01:04:31.603]  All right, here is the clip.
[01:04:32.685 --> 01:04:35.006]  Saul's kingdom was broke into two parts.
[01:04:35.326 --> 01:04:38.407]  One where he had a mind, and one where he lost it.
[01:04:38.867 --> 01:04:41.188]  And his presidential seal fell off his toe.
[01:04:41.508 --> 01:04:44.349]  But a David was brought on the scene.
[01:04:44.509 --> 01:04:49.051]  What nobody realized, they stepped into a time of two kings.
[01:04:49.391 --> 01:04:54.013]  It's just like during the time of two kings, Saul went to see a witch.
[01:04:54.353 --> 01:04:59.375]  Well, during the time of two kings, a witch comes on Fox and throws out tarot cards.
[01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:02.117]  Saul standing there with his javelin in his hand.
[01:05:02.597 --> 01:05:03.758]  And he throws it at David.
[01:05:04.739 --> 01:05:06.060]  And David just moved.
[01:05:07.181 --> 01:05:08.982]  Saul neglects his borders.
[01:05:09.623 --> 01:05:15.027]  He spends all of his effort and all of his time trying to destroy David.
[01:05:16.067 --> 01:05:20.311]  Anything that threatened Israel, David was on the scene because David was the king.
[01:05:20.591 --> 01:05:22.492]  He's consulted by everybody.
[01:05:22.512 --> 01:05:23.893]  He ends up leading the army.
[01:05:23.934 --> 01:05:25.435]  He ends up leading everything.
[01:05:25.615 --> 01:05:26.876]  But yet he has no crown.
[01:05:29.761 --> 01:05:31.582]  Very, very interesting, Roger.
[01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:37.044]  Alex, look, it fits with everything else.
[01:05:37.084 --> 01:05:49.408]  I'm sure you saw Jesse Waters had a whistleblower last night who tells him confidently, not happily, but confidently that there's going to be another assassination attempt on the president's life.
[01:05:50.088 --> 01:05:51.109]  I still fear this.
[01:05:52.529 --> 01:05:54.350]  I pray over more than anything else.
[01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:58.531]  Now, you may have more up to date information than I do.
[01:05:58.591 --> 01:06:02.912]  It's clear that the Secret Service, that they've beefed up his protection.
[01:06:02.972 --> 01:06:04.912]  He's got more personnel and more resources.
[01:06:04.972 --> 01:06:10.434]  But Alex, there are two indisputable facts here that you really cannot dispute.
[01:06:10.454 --> 01:06:11.714]  We now know for a certainty
[01:06:12.375 --> 01:06:27.127]  That the Secret Service and the Pennsylvania State Police and the local police knew that there was a man with a gun who had been seen using a rangefinder on the scene at the location for 92 minutes.
[01:06:28.008 --> 01:06:33.172]  And they didn't evacuate President Donald Trump and they didn't warn the president.
[01:06:34.033 --> 01:06:41.719]  Then the other indisputable fact is that the counter sniper we now know had the shooter in his sights.
[01:06:42.864 --> 01:06:51.475]  Could have killed him, but waited until he got off a volley of shots before killing him and therefore silencing him.
[01:06:51.995 --> 01:07:01.788]  Those two factors are what, based on everything I know from the Kennedy assassination and my current research into the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan,
[01:07:02.637 --> 01:07:04.940]  That's the kind of stand down you had in Dallas.
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:10.728]  That's the kind of stand down you may have had in 1981 around Reagan.
[01:07:11.348 --> 01:07:14.633]  This is something I'm deeply concerned about.
[01:07:16.167 --> 01:07:17.048]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:17.068 --> 01:07:19.189]  You know, I know who shot John.
[01:07:19.209 --> 01:07:20.050]  You're exactly right.
[01:07:39.812 --> 01:07:43.497]  I'm praying that the president doesn't trust the Secret Service.
[01:07:44.058 --> 01:07:49.346]  He's already rejected their demand that he not do these signature outdoor rallies.
[01:07:50.267 --> 01:07:55.275]  You know, he said his statement on True Social right after being shot.
[01:07:56.451 --> 01:08:00.714]  That he was not going to give in to fear, that he would never surrender to fear.
[01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:04.256]  That's the Trump that I know.
[01:08:05.136 --> 01:08:17.664]  This contest for president is turning out to be more difficult than even I had thought because the mainstream media is dedicated to building Kamala Harris in something she most definitely is not.
[01:08:18.044 --> 01:08:19.605]  It's an astroturf campaign.
[01:08:19.645 --> 01:08:21.726]  We're asked to believe overnight.
[01:08:22.290 --> 01:08:31.432]  That she's gone from one of the least popular political figures in the country to being among the most, when she hasn't had any major public performance yet.
[01:08:31.772 --> 01:08:32.872]  She hasn't been tested.
[01:08:32.972 --> 01:08:37.873]  Sure, she can do a press conference and taunt Donald Trump about debates, but I wouldn't worry about that.
[01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:38.933]  You're gonna have debates.
[01:08:38.973 --> 01:08:40.614]  There'll be plenty of debates.
[01:08:40.674 --> 01:08:45.215]  In fact, I suspect she'll regret ever going to debate with Donald Trump.
[01:08:45.235 --> 01:08:47.515]  But she's not the nominee of her party yet.
[01:08:47.575 --> 01:08:52.016]  Why should Trump agree to nominate someone, debate someone who is not yet
[01:08:52.296 --> 01:09:08.592]  Well, that's right, and again, Nixon, I know privately, as you've talked about this privately with me, you know, told you what he thought about the JFK assassination, and then now the tape is out there of him basically threatening the CIA that they try to remove him.
[01:09:09.432 --> 01:09:11.654]  He had that information, but getting back
[01:09:12.557 --> 01:09:13.138]  We're good to go.
[01:09:31.761 --> 01:09:32.421]  We're good to go.
[01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:56.429]  And I'm going back to the very same place they tried to kill me.
[01:09:56.449 --> 01:09:58.170]  They haven't announced the date yet.
[01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:00.190]  You say that's the Trump you know.
[01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.710]  Great!
[01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:02.290]  I know he has courage.
[01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:06.911]  I don't need him to stick his head, you know, in a lion's mouth to prove it or a crocodile's mouth.
[01:10:07.491 --> 01:10:08.312]  Can you speak to that?
[01:10:09.392 --> 01:10:09.652]  Yes.
[01:10:10.352 --> 01:10:14.673]  At first, when I heard that he was going back to Butler, Pennsylvania, I said, why would he do that?
[01:10:14.753 --> 01:10:17.473]  But now I understand precisely why he's doing it.
[01:10:17.853 --> 01:10:22.314]  There's a new phenomena in the country, Alex, called assassination deniers.
[01:10:23.058 --> 01:10:25.660]  Led by Joy Reed at MSNBC.
[01:10:26.341 --> 01:10:29.344]  She actually says on air there was no assassination attempt.
[01:10:29.364 --> 01:10:35.349]  Nobody shot at Trump, that he bit some kind of fake capsule to simulate blood.
[01:10:35.909 --> 01:10:36.910]  This is outrageous.
[01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:41.314]  It's all over social media that this was a PSYOP.
[01:10:41.414 --> 01:10:44.557]  Sometimes it's a PSYOP orchestrated by Roger Stone.
[01:10:44.597 --> 01:10:47.259]  That's defamatory.
[01:10:47.279 --> 01:10:49.101]  It's also false, obviously.
[01:10:49.361 --> 01:10:49.882]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:01.141 --> 01:11:17.104]  In order to ensure that there's not only no more questions asked about this, but that there be no public sympathy for Donald Trump, you have many on the left trying to pretend something we saw with our own eyes never actually happened.
[01:11:17.384 --> 01:11:26.086]  And the FBI director did not hurt this narrative when he said in his testimony, speculated that perhaps Trump wasn't hit by a bullet.
[01:11:27.774 --> 01:11:32.595]  This added to this insanity that's going on in the country right now.
[01:11:32.896 --> 01:11:48.019]  I just put a piece up on Substack about this because they want this assassination and questions about it out of the news as quickly as possible so they can move forward with the coronation of Kamala Harris.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:54.441]  Also, Alex, I should add that my sources, the same sources you told me on Friday,
[01:11:55.154 --> 01:11:58.935]  Joe Biden would resign by letter on Sunday.
[01:11:59.756 --> 01:12:18.542]  Now tell me that Barack Obama has moved very aggressively to take control of Kamala's campaign, that he is basically told Kamala Harris and the Harris folks that the selection of Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who is Jewish,
[01:12:19.062 --> 01:12:20.103]  We're good to go.
[01:12:38.246 --> 01:12:54.053]  Well, he partnered with a Chinese communist company that actually makes these surveillance balloons, the kind of balloon that was used to spy on the United States not so long ago that Joe Biden let float blissfully across the country without shooting it down.
[01:12:54.493 --> 01:12:55.874]  And let me just add this.
[01:12:57.194 --> 01:12:58.295]  This happened two weeks ago.
[01:12:59.215 --> 01:13:04.478]  Eric Holder came in to manage, they admitted that, the selection of the VP.
[01:13:05.099 --> 01:13:08.881]  And so Kamala's got to be really worried about whoever they select, because obviously they really want to be president.
[01:13:09.261 --> 01:13:10.862]  Who are they honing in on right now?
[01:13:12.123 --> 01:13:13.884]  What's your prediction on who they're going to pick for VP?
[01:13:15.258 --> 01:13:29.134]  I my guess is that that that Kamala will bow to Obama and not take Josh Shapiro, who would have made sense from a political point of view if he could bring them Pennsylvania and Kelly
[01:13:30.167 --> 01:13:31.868]  Evidently, he's a side job as a U.S.
[01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:36.411]  Senator from Arizona, but he's making big money on Chinese communist spy balloons.
[01:13:36.772 --> 01:13:37.752]  That kind of lets him out.
[01:13:38.213 --> 01:13:43.456]  This brings us to a guy I never even heard of, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota.
[01:13:43.536 --> 01:13:45.798]  I had to go look up who this guy is.
[01:13:46.378 --> 01:13:56.885]  I saw him making particularly nasty racist attacks on Trump yesterday on X, so he'll fit right in, but he's kind of an angry white guy, an angry white progressive.
[01:13:58.245 --> 01:14:00.566]  Clearly, that is, I think, where she is headed.
[01:14:00.626 --> 01:14:05.146]  This is the do no harm theory of selection of a running mate.
[01:14:05.226 --> 01:14:11.567]  In other words, as Nixon once told me, don't look for someone who can help you, just find someone who doesn't hurt you.
[01:14:11.967 --> 01:14:21.709]  I think that they end up with this fellow Walsh as a guy who brings them no political risk.
[01:14:22.509 --> 01:14:26.810]  And I also saw a report that suddenly his security has magically been beefed up.
[01:14:29.119 --> 01:14:35.005]  Yeah, another sign that he may be on the verge of selection.
[01:14:35.486 --> 01:14:43.795]  The fact that Trump went to Minnesota last Saturday, a state that heretofore was thought to be beyond his reach, tells you that Minnesota is winnable.
[01:14:43.875 --> 01:14:46.258]  Otherwise, he would not be going there.
[01:14:46.938 --> 01:14:59.454]  We're going to go through a little bit of a rough patch here where the mainstream media does their best to create this illusion that Kamala Harris can win, is going to win, that her campaign is on fire.
[01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:04.852]  That all of that is really mostly astroturfing.
[01:15:04.872 --> 01:15:07.735]  You hit it in the previous segment very hard.
[01:15:08.255 --> 01:15:15.841]  Tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions, pouring into her campaign in laundered money.
[01:15:16.442 --> 01:15:21.586]  Those are not real campaign contributions, therefore that is not a measure of her popularity.
[01:15:21.926 --> 01:15:22.667]  No, I totally agree with you.
[01:15:46.607 --> 01:15:50.328]  Getting back to the Bible, I'm no theologian, but I've studied it and I see it in my life repeating.
[01:15:51.309 --> 01:15:53.389]  Things repeat over and over again in the same pattern.
[01:15:53.409 --> 01:16:03.213]  So you have Saul who's the fake king, David who's the real king, he gets the spear thrown at him, grazes his ear, and it's the same thing happening here again.
[01:16:04.518 --> 01:16:14.180]  But Brandon Biggs, six months before Trump was hit in the ear, said this, and he's a very well-known speaker.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:17.461]  You can't just guess these things and randomly say these things.
[01:16:17.481 --> 01:16:18.301]  And I want to get him on the show.
[01:16:18.321 --> 01:16:19.021]  I went and looked him up.
[01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:20.601]  He's not made a bunch of other predictions.
[01:16:20.641 --> 01:16:24.102]  It's not like he made 10,000 predictions and then one of them came true.
[01:16:24.982 --> 01:16:29.123]  No, this is a prediction he nailed six months before.
[01:16:29.163 --> 01:16:29.623]  Here's the clip.
[01:16:31.246 --> 01:16:34.588]  ...rising up, and then I saw an attempt on his life.
[01:16:36.029 --> 01:16:42.554]  This bullet flew by his ear, and it came so close to his head that it busted his eardrum.
[01:16:43.135 --> 01:16:49.379]  And I saw, he fell to his knees during this time frame, and he started worshiping the Lord.
[01:16:49.419 --> 01:16:52.541]  He got radically born again during this time frame.
[01:16:52.822 --> 01:16:59.927]  I'm talking, people say he's saved now, but he becomes really on fire for Jesus for what I saw coming.
[01:17:00.327 --> 01:17:01.388]  Well, that's Brandon Biggs.
[01:17:01.488 --> 01:17:03.790]  I mean, that is simply amazing.
[01:17:05.171 --> 01:17:07.974]  God showed me this, and then six months later, it happens.
[01:17:08.174 --> 01:17:10.576]  I mean, you cannot make that stuff up, Roger.
[01:17:11.832 --> 01:17:14.112]  No, in fact, there are others.
[01:17:14.312 --> 01:17:23.674]  Kim Clement, no longer with us, the very famous South African Christian prophet, he foresaw it very quite definitely.
[01:17:23.694 --> 01:17:29.135]  He says on a Saturday that there would be an assassination attempt on Trump.
[01:17:29.175 --> 01:17:30.215]  He turns out to be right.
[01:17:30.596 --> 01:17:38.377]  Amanda Grace, also referring to the Book of Samuel, she saw, this fellow Biggs saw,
[01:17:39.227 --> 01:17:42.131]  So look, I believe in the spiritual realm.
[01:17:42.492 --> 01:17:43.693]  I believe in Jesus Christ.
[01:17:43.793 --> 01:17:47.338]  I believe that Jesus Christ saved Donald Trump's that fateful day.
[01:17:47.378 --> 01:17:51.764]  And I pray that he will do so again, because I'm not worried about winning this campaign.
[01:17:51.784 --> 01:17:53.046]  We're going to win this campaign.
[01:17:53.066 --> 01:17:55.269]  Donald Trump is going to win this election.
[01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:56.169]  We had the right
[01:18:16.468 --> 01:18:16.768]  Go ahead.
[01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:22.434]  We had James O'Keefe on before you and he said he agrees there's going to be some Black Swan events.
[01:18:22.454 --> 01:18:23.395]  The deep state's desperate.
[01:18:23.635 --> 01:18:24.496]  They've got to make the move.
[01:18:24.797 --> 01:18:30.382]  Trump's way more powerful than he was and way more popular than he was before they failed to kill him.
[01:18:31.303 --> 01:18:34.387]  Roger, what else are they going to pull?
[01:18:34.507 --> 01:18:35.568]  I mean, it seems like anything.
[01:18:36.721 --> 01:18:40.064]  Well, they just ordered a bunch of bird flu vaccination.
[01:18:40.305 --> 01:18:41.145]  What's that about?
[01:18:41.306 --> 01:18:51.436]  I mean, you know, you've been saying this for some time, that some kind of health-oriented crisis, some pandemic, that's still a possibility.
[01:18:51.976 --> 01:18:54.239]  Look, I think that he's going back to Butler.
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:59.581]  First, as I said, I didn't think it was a great idea, but now I do think it's a good idea.
[01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:05.223]  I'm not saying he should stage a replica of the rally, and he hasn't said that that's what he's going back for.
[01:19:05.744 --> 01:19:14.527]  First of all, he may want to just pay his respects to the family of Corey Comparatore, who tragically died on that Saturday.
[01:19:15.088 --> 01:19:18.149]  But they're trying desperately to get this out of the news.
[01:19:18.249 --> 01:19:22.831]  As you know, you go to Google and you search assassination attempt on Donald Trump, and
[01:19:23.544 --> 01:19:24.265]  Absolutely, Roger.
[01:19:40.759 --> 01:19:46.102]  And look, he's rolling the dice, he says he's going back to the same campground, back to the same fairgrounds.
[01:19:46.622 --> 01:19:48.523]  Hopefully they have better security this time.
[01:19:48.543 --> 01:19:50.164]  But yeah, they're trying to deep-six this.
[01:19:50.204 --> 01:19:56.507]  And notice, they claimed I said things about a shooting I never even really said, took it out of context, and then said I should be taken off the air.
[01:19:56.547 --> 01:20:03.471]  Some of the very same pundits that have called for me to be silenced for questioning a shooting 11 years ago that I haven't even questioned for years before they sued me,
[01:20:04.091 --> 01:20:05.791]  They're the ones saying this just didn't happen.
[01:20:05.811 --> 01:20:10.353]  This is on TV, people are shot, a man gets his brains blown out, and they're denying it.
[01:20:10.533 --> 01:20:14.634]  I talked to you this weekend, they ran headlines everywhere that Trump said, I'm not a Christian.
[01:20:15.114 --> 01:20:17.054]  In the clip, he says, I'm a Christian.
[01:20:17.674 --> 01:20:20.535]  So we're also going to see this gaslighting, this mind control.
[01:20:20.755 --> 01:20:21.175]  Here it is.
[01:20:22.856 --> 01:20:25.697]  And again, Christians get out and vote!
[01:20:26.137 --> 01:20:27.197]  Just this time!
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:32.421]  You won't have to do it anymore.
[01:20:32.541 --> 01:20:34.022]  Four more years, you know what?
[01:20:34.562 --> 01:20:35.363]  It'll be fixed.
[01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:36.343]  It'll be fine.
[01:20:37.003 --> 01:20:39.385]  You won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.
[01:20:39.465 --> 01:20:40.445]  I love you, Christians.
[01:20:40.525 --> 01:20:41.406]  I'm a Christian.
[01:20:41.846 --> 01:20:42.486]  I love you.
[01:20:42.567 --> 01:20:43.067]  Get out.
[01:20:43.187 --> 01:20:44.728]  You gotta get out and vote.
[01:20:45.188 --> 01:20:47.009]  In four years, you don't have to vote again.
[01:20:47.029 --> 01:20:49.170]  We'll have it fixed so good, you're not gonna have to vote.
[01:20:49.951 --> 01:20:51.131]  No one trumps Beats.
[01:20:51.151 --> 01:20:52.352]  He's got that New York accent.
[01:20:52.392 --> 01:20:53.312]  Yeah, I'm a Christian.
[01:20:53.813 --> 01:20:55.013]  That's not, I'm not a Christian.
[01:20:55.033 --> 01:20:55.774]  Yeah, I'm a Christian.
[01:20:56.937 --> 01:21:04.664]  It's clear, and obviously he's not saying dictatorship, he means we're going to take the country back, fix it so good, political realignment, it won't be as desperate to vote in the future.
[01:21:04.704 --> 01:21:05.424]  Is that what he was saying?
[01:21:06.705 --> 01:21:07.086]  Could be.
[01:21:07.106 --> 01:21:12.710]  He could also, of course, be referring to the rapture, in which case he would be correct.
[01:21:12.951 --> 01:21:16.874]  So, look, they're going to use anything they possibly can to smear him.
[01:21:16.894 --> 01:21:18.896]  What they're trying to do now to J.D.
[01:21:18.996 --> 01:21:20.077]  Vance is outrageous.
[01:21:20.157 --> 01:21:21.578]  Here's the real problem with J.D.
[01:21:21.598 --> 01:21:21.878]  Vance.
[01:21:22.459 --> 01:21:23.359]  They're elitists.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.201]  These people are snobs.
[01:21:26.084 --> 01:21:26.924]  They don't like J.D.
[01:21:27.104 --> 01:21:29.165]  Vance because he's actually a regular guy.
[01:21:29.225 --> 01:21:31.326]  Notice he came from dirt, he came from nothing.
[01:21:31.686 --> 01:21:49.834]  He came from a poor background and he has earned everything he has, an amazing academic career, an amazing military career, an amazing experience as an entrepreneur and a businessman, also a creator, an author, a documentary filmmaker, and a great U.S.
[01:21:49.874 --> 01:21:50.314]  Senator.
[01:21:50.694 --> 01:21:52.675]  The reason they're trying to denigrate him
[01:21:53.555 --> 01:21:56.277]  Is because he's not a leftist elite.
[01:21:56.397 --> 01:21:58.359]  He's from the working class.
[01:21:58.419 --> 01:22:01.301]  He's a blue-collar American who made it.
[01:22:02.002 --> 01:22:05.144]  He is, in fact, a proof of the American dream.
[01:22:05.164 --> 01:22:06.385]  This is why they're attacking him.
[01:22:06.945 --> 01:22:09.547]  He's going to prove to be the right choice.
[01:22:09.607 --> 01:22:15.892]  He is not a neocon, and that's the single most important thing.
[01:22:16.832 --> 01:22:21.776]  Notice the people who are saying, oh, all the supporters of Trump are weird, really.
[01:22:23.457 --> 01:22:26.139]  Admiral Rachel Levine.
[01:22:26.239 --> 01:22:26.880]  That's normal?
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.283]  A man who dresses in women's clothes who's an admiral and heads the HHS?
[01:22:31.323 --> 01:22:32.144]  Roger, stay there.
[01:22:32.164 --> 01:22:33.725]  I want to do like 5-10 more minutes.
[01:22:33.745 --> 01:22:37.008]  I want to finish up on how we're weird and they're normal.
[01:22:37.568 --> 01:22:40.330]  They say two men can have a baby.
[01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.810]  It's crazy.
[01:22:40.831 --> 01:22:43.533]  Then I want to get into will they replace Kamala?
[01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:45.661]  Is that still on the cards?
[01:22:45.701 --> 01:22:47.563]  What are you expecting at the DNC coming up?
[01:22:47.603 --> 01:22:50.426]  A few more minutes with Roger Stone, StoneZone.com.

[01:22:54.089 --> 01:22:54.910]  Roger Stone's our guest.
[01:22:54.930 --> 01:22:55.271]  Stay with us.
[01:22:55.848 --> 01:22:59.129]  This is a real attempt to turn America and the world around.
[01:22:59.149 --> 01:23:01.150]  This is a real attempt to stop World War III.
[01:23:01.190 --> 01:23:04.131]  This is a real attempt to save civilization for our children.
[01:23:04.351 --> 01:23:07.172]  Because there's not just evil in the world, there's good as well.
[01:23:07.512 --> 01:23:14.755]  And so you've got to decide that that's happening, and join it, and promote it, and support Trump, and support us, and spread the word.
[01:23:14.795 --> 01:23:19.356]  Because that's what they fear, is when you get a mission, and you get committed, and you take action.
[01:23:19.396 --> 01:23:21.157]  So tell everybody about the links at RolexJones.

[01:23:37.886 --> 01:23:40.228]  A big sale going on right now.
[01:23:40.588 --> 01:23:42.269]  Everybody needs nitric mousse.
[01:23:42.329 --> 01:23:44.190]  It cleans out your blood and flushes all this crap out.
[01:23:44.431 --> 01:23:48.453]  Everybody needs the nano silver toothpastes and products at DRJonesNaturals.com.
[01:23:48.873 --> 01:23:49.994]  This is a war!
[01:23:55.848 --> 01:23:58.150]  All right, Roger Stone's our guest for a few more minutes.
[01:23:59.111 --> 01:24:01.192]  But I just want listeners to listen to me, and I know listeners are.
[01:24:01.212 --> 01:24:02.513]  That's why they're listening.
[01:24:03.174 --> 01:24:09.919]  But the epicness of the moment in history we're in right now cannot be underestimated, and the extreme danger.
[01:24:09.959 --> 01:24:11.581]  So Roger, I hate to ask you this question.
[01:24:11.601 --> 01:24:17.045]  I asked you this two weeks ago and last week, and you kind of dodged the question.
[01:24:17.085 --> 01:24:20.488]  And I get why you did, because I don't want to go there either.
[01:24:20.528 --> 01:24:22.950]  But if Trump would have been killed or turned into a vegetable,
[01:24:24.183 --> 01:24:24.804]  18 days ago.
[01:24:25.324 --> 01:24:27.166]  We'd be in a whole nother world right now.
[01:24:28.327 --> 01:24:29.127]  Can you speak to that?
[01:24:29.187 --> 01:24:36.212]  And I want to shift gears into Kamala Harris and Obama publicly in control of her now, and she's got to know how much danger she's in.
[01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:43.398]  They know how horribly unpopular she is, but because she legally had control of the money, they can't give it to anybody else but the VP.
[01:24:43.838 --> 01:24:45.239]  That's why they're keeping her as a placeholder.
[01:24:45.259 --> 01:24:49.763]  They get rid of her now, or they were able to steal the election once she's in.
[01:24:50.123 --> 01:24:51.484]  So let's speak to both those points.
[01:24:53.561 --> 01:25:02.005]  Alex's third one, and that of course is, does somebody decide that elevating her to the presidency is the best way to strengthen her candidacy?
[01:25:03.806 --> 01:25:20.614]  A government that killed John F. Kennedy, which I believe they did, tried to kill Ronald Reagan, tried to kill Donald Trump, is certainly capable of assassinating our current president to elevate the political prospects of Kamala Harris.
[01:25:20.874 --> 01:25:21.574]  So let me stop you.
[01:25:21.614 --> 01:25:22.134]  Let me stop you.
[01:25:22.174 --> 01:25:23.735]  We talked two weeks ago when you said this.
[01:25:23.855 --> 01:25:24.535]  We talked this weekend.
[01:25:24.575 --> 01:25:27.296]  I meant to get you on about this subject, and I forgot.
[01:25:27.336 --> 01:25:28.537]  This is the whole point of the interview.
[01:25:28.597 --> 01:25:29.097]  Thank you.
[01:25:29.737 --> 01:25:30.257]  Start over.
[01:25:30.317 --> 01:25:31.118]  You've got the floor.
[01:25:31.798 --> 01:25:34.799]  Explaining they're really pushing 25th Amendment.
[01:25:34.839 --> 01:25:37.640]  Well, if he's really incompetent, we've got to go and get rid of him now.
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:43.802]  That way they elevate her by making her the president now to make her look more legitimate if they try to steal it.
[01:25:44.342 --> 01:25:45.122]  Flesh that out.
[01:25:45.182 --> 01:25:45.623]  Explain that.
[01:25:45.743 --> 01:25:46.623]  This is so important.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:58.673]  It's important to recognize that under the 25th Amendment, if the sitting vice president and a majority of the cabinet favor the removal of the president, they are removed.
[01:25:59.889 --> 01:26:04.612]  The president has the right to appeal that to both houses of Congress.
[01:26:05.173 --> 01:26:07.354]  He doesn't have to appeal it, but he can appeal it.
[01:26:08.075 --> 01:26:09.316]  There's a lot of news stories.
[01:26:09.596 --> 01:26:20.604]  Seymour Hersh, a veteran investigative reporter with the New York Times, a prize-winning reporter, has a piece in which he reports that his sources tell him
[01:26:21.604 --> 01:26:29.910]  That Joe Biden had to be threatened with removal under the 25th Amendment to get him to throw in the towel and drop out of this race.
[01:26:30.831 --> 01:26:49.644]  That makes sense, given the timeline, because there's only six hours between the period in which he says he's absolutely not withdrawing, that he's not going anywhere, and then releasing this letter, which isn't on White House letterhead and signature that looks vaguely like his, but not exactly.
[01:26:50.548 --> 01:27:03.416]  And therefore, it occurred to me that the best way to elevate her candidacy, actually make her a historic figure, would if she became the first woman president.
[01:27:03.817 --> 01:27:10.841]  That would mean that Joe Biden would have to either leave office through the 25th Amendment, or of course, he would have to die.
[01:27:12.314 --> 01:27:14.395]  And that's not that far-fetched.
[01:27:14.595 --> 01:27:18.356]  I wrote a New York Times bestselling book about the murder of Kennedy.
[01:27:18.416 --> 01:27:27.499]  I think there were government involvement in that, Central Intelligence Agency, certainly the Secret Service, and the FBI who covered it up.
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:33.421]  I believe the same dark forces tried to kill Ronald Reagan in 1981.
[01:27:33.461 --> 01:27:37.583]  They're the same dark forces that tried to kill Donald Trump.
[01:27:38.522 --> 01:27:53.473]  Do they are they capable of taking Joe Biden out because he's in the way of Kamala's election that making her president before the election would bestow a whole nother level of legitimacy on her.
[01:27:53.734 --> 01:27:54.835]  I'm not predicting that.
[01:27:54.855 --> 01:27:56.356]  I'm certainly not calling for it.
[01:27:56.456 --> 01:27:57.336]  I want to be very clear.
[01:27:57.717 --> 01:28:02.280]  I'm just saying that given our history, it's a very real possibility.
[01:28:06.784 --> 01:28:07.064]  Roger.
[01:28:09.128 --> 01:28:10.330]  You didn't answer the question again.
[01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:12.893]  I know you're friends with Trump, close friends.
[01:28:12.953 --> 01:28:14.215]  We don't speak it and it happens.
[01:28:14.235 --> 01:28:20.363]  We're saying if they would have killed him, they obviously... That's a political question.
[01:28:20.583 --> 01:28:22.225]  So here's how it works mechanically.
[01:28:22.245 --> 01:28:26.811]  The Republican National Committee, three members from every state,
[01:28:29.277 --> 01:28:38.446]  I mean, I'm not sure who would have taken this mantle.
[01:28:38.486 --> 01:28:40.068]  You could make an argument that J.D.
[01:28:40.168 --> 01:28:44.012]  Vance would take the mantle because he's the last man selected by Trump.
[01:28:44.772 --> 01:28:50.378]  I would be opposed to the idea of nominating somebody in that instance who had run against Trump.
[01:28:51.839 --> 01:28:53.080]  Look, it didn't happen.
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:29:02.684]  That's the legal and political process for replacing a nominee who passes away prior to the election or in this case would have been murdered.
[01:29:02.724 --> 01:29:04.745]  But thank God that didn't happen.
[01:29:05.426 --> 01:29:08.387]  And if we continue to pray that it won't happen.
[01:29:08.627 --> 01:29:13.071]  There is no logical figure to run this America First movement.
[01:29:13.091 --> 01:29:26.444]  There is no logical figure who can move working class Democrats, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, younger Americans who are moving into our coalition.
[01:29:27.518 --> 01:29:29.059]  John McCain could never have done this.
[01:29:29.119 --> 01:29:31.060]  Mitt Romney certainly could never have done this.
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:44.028]  The Republicans nominated in 2016 a candidate with crossover appeal, a candidate who could win the votes of blue-collar, working-class Democrats and independents.
[01:29:44.468 --> 01:29:45.709]  That's why they fear him.
[01:29:45.749 --> 01:29:49.291]  That's why they fear he's about to win another election.
[01:29:50.252 --> 01:29:54.656]  I just thank God that it didn't happen, Alex, because there is no logical successor.
[01:29:54.716 --> 01:29:56.258]  That person does not exist.
[01:29:56.658 --> 01:29:58.680]  Donald Trump is indeed unique.
[01:29:59.901 --> 01:30:01.503]  All right, I've asked a lot of questions here.
[01:30:03.351 --> 01:30:06.052]  And I'm going to let you go, but every time I let you go, then I wish I would have asked them.
[01:30:06.072 --> 01:30:11.393]  That's why I'm glad you brought up the whole thing about they may get rid of Biden or remove him from the 25th Amendment.
[01:30:11.813 --> 01:30:14.794]  And I think that's really where all the evidence is pointing.
[01:30:15.354 --> 01:30:17.354]  Their own corporate media undermining Biden right now.
[01:30:17.414 --> 01:30:19.375]  I think that's clearly being tried behind the scenes.
[01:30:19.935 --> 01:30:26.517]  Looking into Obama's mind and who he's working for, let's general this out a little bit.
[01:30:26.917 --> 01:30:27.837]  What do you think they're going to pull?
[01:30:29.970 --> 01:30:41.557]  Well, I predicted here earlier that they're going to take this obscure Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, for vice president because he is the least controversial of the potential running mates.
[01:30:42.678 --> 01:30:55.285]  The Democratic Party has a gigantic issue, given its divisions over the issues and the events in the Middle East and the attacks sponsored by Iran.
[01:30:56.186 --> 01:31:00.129]  It was paid for by Iran, but on Israel it began October 7th.
[01:31:01.129 --> 01:31:03.170]  They want to try to have it both ways.
[01:31:03.231 --> 01:31:04.751]  They cannot have it both ways.
[01:31:05.452 --> 01:31:07.413]  Their party's badly divided.
[01:31:07.733 --> 01:31:08.834]  They have a lot of problems.
[01:31:09.014 --> 01:31:10.935]  Are they capable of another pandemic?
[01:31:11.036 --> 01:31:11.336]  Yes.
[01:31:12.056 --> 01:31:14.738]  Are they capable of another attempt on Trump's life?
[01:31:15.058 --> 01:31:15.298]  Yes.
[01:31:15.759 --> 01:31:25.685]  My conclusion after studying as much as I can about what happened in Butler and also the knowledge of having written a book on this subject, I think they are capable of anything.
[01:31:27.746 --> 01:31:28.947]  I'm praying about this.
[01:31:28.967 --> 01:31:30.989]  It's really vexing.
[01:31:31.609 --> 01:31:37.794]  In a world in which I'm used to looking at polling and finite information, we're in a spiritual war now.
[01:31:38.034 --> 01:31:39.515]  There is no question about that.
[01:31:40.177 --> 01:31:44.581]  As I've said on your show many times, the single most important thing people can do is to pray.
[01:31:44.921 --> 01:31:45.842]  Pray for the nation.
[01:31:46.263 --> 01:31:48.585]  Pray for the protection of our president.
[01:31:49.065 --> 01:31:56.012]  Pray for the protection of all the truth tellers who are out there telling the truth every day and who are vilified for doing so.
[01:31:57.453 --> 01:31:59.315]  Roger, recently you've talked to Trump.
[01:32:01.136 --> 01:32:02.197]  What was his attitude?
[01:32:02.237 --> 01:32:02.938]  How's he doing?
[01:32:03.579 --> 01:32:04.720]  What's your view on the big guy?
[01:32:06.091 --> 01:32:08.994]  Uh, you know, he's, uh, I think his head's in a very good place.
[01:32:09.034 --> 01:32:11.796]  He's, uh, as I told you, Alex, I think he's a different person.
[01:32:11.836 --> 01:32:13.498]  I think he's very calm.
[01:32:13.578 --> 01:32:15.039]  He's very serene.
[01:32:15.059 --> 01:32:18.482]  Uh, it's not that he's, you know, he hasn't lost his competitive edge.
[01:32:18.542 --> 01:32:19.423]  I assure you of that.
[01:32:19.823 --> 01:32:20.704]  He's the same.
[01:32:21.964 --> 01:32:27.926]  I don't know how this guy does it timewise.
[01:32:27.966 --> 01:32:34.149]  I mean, he receives the prime minister of Israel on Friday in Mar-a-Lago, Florida.
[01:32:34.489 --> 01:32:40.971]  He flies to Minnesota and does an incredibly large rally in a state that's looking increasingly winnable.
[01:32:41.771 --> 01:32:46.936]  And then he goes to the Bitcoin conference in Nashville.
[01:32:47.377 --> 01:32:52.302]  So his energy level continues to amaze.
[01:32:53.263 --> 01:32:57.627]  And meanwhile, you have the Democrats out with this crazy
[01:33:00.814 --> 01:33:01.635]  What would you call it?
[01:33:02.435 --> 01:33:05.758]  It's almost like they put out a formal memo.
[01:33:06.138 --> 01:33:10.702]  The puppet masters put out a memo and everybody jumps on board.
[01:33:10.882 --> 01:33:12.263]  Oh, J.D.
[01:33:12.303 --> 01:33:13.164]  Vance is weird.
[01:33:13.224 --> 01:33:14.345]  Donald Trump is weird.
[01:33:14.985 --> 01:33:16.186]  Roger Stone is weird.
[01:33:16.286 --> 01:33:17.307]  Alex Jones, we're weird.
[01:33:17.367 --> 01:33:17.687]  Really?
[01:33:18.088 --> 01:33:19.729]  I'd say they're the ones who are weird.
[01:33:21.845 --> 01:33:24.107]  Last question, and I've got the different polls here.
[01:33:25.088 --> 01:33:35.035]  Obviously they use a lot of push polls to say she's neck and neck or she's right behind, but if you look at the big scientific polls, Trump is way ahead in the general election, you know, across the country, doing very well in battlegrounds.
[01:33:36.396 --> 01:33:39.499]  Is Kamala weaker than Biden or stronger or is it a dead heat?
[01:33:39.559 --> 01:33:44.843]  I mean, looking at all these, you look at hundreds of polls, where do you dead reckon Trump is right now?
[01:33:45.714 --> 01:33:52.480]  Well, first of all, it's very hard to pull within the eye of the storm and get an accurate results because attitudes are moving very quickly.
[01:33:52.781 --> 01:33:54.923]  The news is very moving very quickly.
[01:33:55.483 --> 01:34:04.752]  So any poll right now has to be taken with a little bit of a grain of salt, particularly when she's, you know, the subject of this giant media buildup.
[01:34:05.439 --> 01:34:15.847]  My guess is that when things settle down, you're going to find out that she's about as strong as Biden, probably running at about the same place, and that Donald Trump continues to maintain a narrow lead.
[01:34:16.147 --> 01:34:17.888]  But I stress the word narrow.
[01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:33.420]  Any patriot, any info warrior, any free thinker, any Trump supporter, anyone out there who thinks that this is in the bag, or it's a sure thing, or we can go home, that's a gigantic, gigantic mistake.
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:45.924]  We're in for a very tight and important and close election, but I still think Trump will, when everything settles down here, after they have a nominee, he will still have the upper hand.
[01:34:46.124 --> 01:34:47.885]  And the polling will reflect that.
[01:34:48.025 --> 01:34:49.805]  Stonezone.com, I keep seeing last question.
[01:34:49.845 --> 01:34:52.706]  I keep thinking of really important ones I meant to ask you when I've asked you on the last week.
[01:34:52.726 --> 01:34:56.867]  You said, let's wait things material come on, because you wanted to get your bearings on things.
[01:34:56.907 --> 01:34:58.328]  And I get that you didn't want to go off half-cocked.
[01:34:58.348 --> 01:34:59.608]  That's why you give such good analysis.
[01:35:00.168 --> 01:35:00.789]  But I see
[01:35:01.869 --> 01:35:14.515]  The radio silence on his criminal trials and his fake criminal conviction and them just shutting up about all that and just crickets as a sign they know they're in trouble and the antipode assassination shows they know he's gonna win.
[01:35:15.115 --> 01:35:16.676]  That's why they desperately did that.
[01:35:16.876 --> 01:35:23.459]  So, looking at the calculus of that, they tried to bring the Russiagate crap back.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:25.400]  I know it came out over the weekend.
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:27.941]  More stuff that was done to you was proven false.
[01:35:27.982 --> 01:35:28.662]  We already knew that.
[01:35:29.909 --> 01:35:32.691]  But their entire, we don't hear about J6 anymore.
[01:35:32.731 --> 01:35:38.115]  We don't hear about Trump, you know, fake rape convictions or any of this BS.
[01:35:39.376 --> 01:35:49.464]  That signifies a lot to me that the bad guys are totally confused right now because they thought assassination was going to be their holy grail.
[01:35:51.272 --> 01:35:56.534]  Yeah, their plan was to run on Trump's a convicted felon.
[01:35:56.734 --> 01:35:58.055]  That backfired badly.
[01:35:58.535 --> 01:36:04.257]  January 6th, half the people don't believe their narrative that they continue to stick to.
[01:36:05.558 --> 01:36:10.620]  Then, of course, Trump wants to take away a woman's right to abortion, not his position.
[01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:12.041]  We're for states' rights.
[01:36:12.481 --> 01:36:17.243]  We favor the states making decisions about whether to restrict abortion or not.
[01:36:18.143 --> 01:36:20.905]  And that Trump is going to cut your Social Security.
[01:36:21.205 --> 01:36:29.971]  That's what the whole Project 2025 thing was about, to try to marry Trump to issue positions that are not his positions.
[01:36:30.952 --> 01:36:41.219]  And they spent a lot of money and a lot of time and a lot of effort trying to connect us to a think tank manifesto that is not Donald Trump's.
[01:36:41.739 --> 01:36:46.667]  And I think he very adroitly sidestepped that by saying, no, no, this is my platform.
[01:36:46.968 --> 01:36:52.457]  The Platform Committee of the Republican National Convention just passed it, and it was ratified by the entire convention.
[01:36:53.163 --> 01:37:05.535]  That is what we're running on, not this esoteric conservative nonprofit over here that has an agenda which has some good things in it and has some other things in there that are just not consistent with what Donald Trump thinks.
[01:37:05.975 --> 01:37:13.583]  So that was a major initiative by the Democrats and their friends in the mainstream media, and it failed.
[01:37:14.303 --> 01:37:16.164]  Now we're down to name-calling.
[01:37:17.045 --> 01:37:17.845]  Really, that's what this is.
[01:37:17.905 --> 01:37:19.747]  It's like base name-calling.
[01:37:20.207 --> 01:37:21.988]  Oh, J.D.
[01:37:22.028 --> 01:37:23.028]  Vance is weird.
[01:37:23.089 --> 01:37:23.949]  No, actually, I met him.
[01:37:24.389 --> 01:37:25.390]  He's a terrific guy.
[01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:27.031]  He's not weird at all.
[01:37:28.151 --> 01:37:28.972]  Oh, I met him, too.
[01:37:29.112 --> 01:37:31.333]  Total down-home confidence good old boy.
[01:37:33.975 --> 01:37:35.756]  Yeah, it's elitism is what it is.
[01:37:35.796 --> 01:37:37.397]  He comes from a working-class background.
[01:37:37.417 --> 01:37:38.277]  That's why they hate him.
[01:37:38.338 --> 01:37:40.659]  He's a personification of the American dream.
[01:37:41.606 --> 01:37:42.627]  He started with nothing.
[01:37:42.687 --> 01:37:43.387]  No one helped him.
[01:37:43.467 --> 01:37:44.688]  He did it all himself.
[01:37:44.748 --> 01:37:45.968]  He earned everything he asked.
[01:37:46.608 --> 01:37:47.889]  And people say, well, I don't know.
[01:37:47.969 --> 01:37:49.450]  Look at his record in the U.S.
[01:37:49.470 --> 01:37:49.770]  Senate.
[01:37:50.850 --> 01:37:53.592]  I said things 20 years ago I don't agree with today.
[01:37:53.712 --> 01:37:56.333]  I've changed my position on things and issues.
[01:37:56.373 --> 01:38:03.696]  You find somebody who gets new information and isn't open to changing their mind, that's not somebody I want to be president or vice president.
[01:38:03.736 --> 01:38:05.357]  But look at J.D.
[01:38:05.397 --> 01:38:07.178]  Vance's actual record.
[01:38:07.598 --> 01:38:09.679]  He's going to prove himself in this campaign.
[01:38:09.739 --> 01:38:12.780]  His defining moment is going to come.
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:14.240]  I absolutely believe this.
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:17.121]  And he's going to turn out to be exactly the right choice.
[01:38:17.501 --> 01:38:20.162]  I had Tulsi Gabbard on my radio show last weekend.
[01:38:20.562 --> 01:38:22.423]  She would like to have been chosen herself.
[01:38:22.603 --> 01:38:31.446]  She made an excellent case, not only against Kamala Harris, who she famously destroyed in a debate, but also why J.D.
[01:38:31.546 --> 01:38:32.126]  Vance was
[01:38:32.506 --> 01:38:34.568]  Yeah, she's a real team player.
[01:38:34.588 --> 01:38:36.669]  I hope she has a prominent role in the administration.
[01:38:36.689 --> 01:38:37.850]  And this is the cherry on top.
[01:38:38.431 --> 01:38:43.515]  You always harp, even on the show, a decade now, but you always harp on the censorship.
[01:38:44.056 --> 01:38:44.896]  We don't have communication.
[01:38:44.936 --> 01:38:45.457]  We can't win.
[01:38:45.537 --> 01:38:50.421]  How pivotal and how all-in is Elon Musk?
[01:38:50.441 --> 01:38:52.322]  I think he's the second target after Trump.
[01:38:52.402 --> 01:38:53.283]  He should watch himself.
[01:38:53.323 --> 01:38:54.264]  I told him that a month ago.
[01:38:54.624 --> 01:38:55.745]  He publicly said, Alex is right.
[01:38:55.785 --> 01:38:57.226]  I'm going to increase my security.
[01:38:57.246 --> 01:38:59.308]  I mean, this is serious.
[01:38:59.368 --> 01:38:59.969]  And then we have
[01:39:01.158 --> 01:39:09.986]  Texas Attorney General Paxton secures a historic $1.4 billion settlement with Facebook over unauthorized biometric data collection and sales.
[01:39:10.686 --> 01:39:11.867]  This is how you get him.
[01:39:12.168 --> 01:39:13.909]  And this is why they're trying to put Paxton in prison.
[01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:16.652]  So speaking to that, how amazing.
[01:39:17.052 --> 01:39:26.120]  Well, speak of the censorship and that whole fight in Musk, and then in closing, Paxton, he needs to, I almost don't want him to leave Texas, but he would make a really good Attorney General, wouldn't he?
[01:39:27.370 --> 01:39:29.072]  Yes, I love Ken Paxson.
[01:39:29.112 --> 01:39:30.554]  I've had him in my home.
[01:39:30.895 --> 01:39:32.396]  He's a great man.
[01:39:33.097 --> 01:39:37.402]  Alex, once again, as you said it before anybody, it's an info war.
[01:39:37.422 --> 01:39:38.243]  That's what we're in.
[01:39:39.185 --> 01:39:46.734]  And yeah, the censorship at Google, which we see going on right now regarding the assassinations, a perfect example of what we're talking about.
[01:39:47.895 --> 01:39:58.850]  They have a Supreme Court ruling that says that these giant social media companies can work with the government to censor and cancel
[01:39:59.667 --> 01:39:59.947]  I don't know.
[01:40:23.343 --> 01:40:31.169]  Facebook is still controlled by the bad guys, as is Instagram, as is TikTok.
[01:40:31.269 --> 01:40:34.252]  I mean, this is a very grave concern, continues to be a concern.
[01:40:34.272 --> 01:40:34.912]  Well, that's right.
[01:40:34.932 --> 01:40:36.714]  We've got Trump Truth Social.
[01:40:37.274 --> 01:40:38.095]  We've got Rumble.
[01:40:38.495 --> 01:40:39.596]  We've got InfoWars.
[01:40:39.636 --> 01:40:47.863]  We've got, you know, all the sites like yours and mine that reach millions a day, but only X reaches hundreds of millions, billions a day, and it has exploded double
[01:40:48.664 --> 01:40:53.826]  Or more the last two years engagement while Facebook, Instagram, Google have gone down in engagement.
[01:40:53.926 --> 01:40:54.966]  They're dying.
[01:40:55.386 --> 01:40:56.186]  They're failing.
[01:40:56.226 --> 01:40:58.587]  They're getting caught now in real time.
[01:40:58.667 --> 01:41:05.409]  And I just got to say people will say, well, Elon Musk is established, but he's he's turning towards us rapidly.
[01:41:05.449 --> 01:41:09.650]  I mean, he's almost aligned with us, Roger, because I think he can smell the coffee.
[01:41:09.931 --> 01:41:11.151]  He knows which way the wind blows.
[01:41:12.874 --> 01:41:17.958]  Above all, I think he's a maverick, and I think he cherishes freedom.
[01:41:18.439 --> 01:41:21.401]  I think that he loves freedom, so I think he's doing great stuff.
[01:41:22.297 --> 01:41:23.618]  I know others have complaints.
[01:41:23.838 --> 01:41:24.798]  I have no complaints.
[01:41:25.479 --> 01:41:33.603]  I'm happy to have my voice back after being completely and totally gagged and then censored on all of these platforms.
[01:41:34.203 --> 01:41:37.485]  This is an important part, by the way, of how we win.
[01:41:37.885 --> 01:41:49.771]  When people see a compelling story, they see a link to a compelling story, say on InfoWars or anywhere for that matter, then you have an obligation to post it and push it and get other people to see it.
[01:41:49.811 --> 01:41:51.512]  Tell us about your big article you just posted.
[01:41:53.019 --> 01:41:55.521]  I did an article today about this.
[01:41:56.142 --> 01:42:02.787]  There's a huge number of people out claiming that the assassination attempt on Trump was a PSYOP.
[01:42:03.471 --> 01:42:07.732]  And they specifically accused me of financing it or directing it.
[01:42:07.752 --> 01:42:10.673]  It reminded me of the lawsuits that were brought against you, Alex.
[01:42:10.713 --> 01:42:12.554]  I mean, can I now sue these people?
[01:42:12.614 --> 01:42:18.796]  Because my family's being harassed, my family's being put in danger because of these crazy falsehoods.
[01:42:19.416 --> 01:42:32.160]  I would think that if we look at your case as a standard, the people who are saying nobody shot Trump, this was all orchestrated by Roger Stone who paid these people, that's a damnable lie.
[01:42:37.341 --> 01:42:37.781]  Absolutely.
[01:42:37.801 --> 01:42:40.162]  And again, in my case, they rigged it.
[01:42:40.302 --> 01:42:42.322]  They had judges find me guilty.
[01:42:42.362 --> 01:42:45.063]  They had a PR firm promote things I never said out of context.
[01:42:45.723 --> 01:42:47.603]  But we all know it's a two-sided justice system.
[01:42:47.623 --> 01:42:50.684]  The good news is America and the world's waking up powerful.
[01:42:51.804 --> 01:42:54.145]  45 Minutes with Roger Stone, stonezone.com.
[01:42:54.505 --> 01:42:56.105]  Roger, God bless you, and we'll talk to you soon.
[01:42:57.153 --> 01:42:57.774]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:42:57.834 --> 01:42:59.515]  God bless you, and keep up the fight.
[01:42:59.875 --> 01:43:00.356]  I will, brother.
[01:43:00.976 --> 01:43:01.276]  All right.
[01:43:01.717 --> 01:43:03.678]  Coming up, she's an amazing talk show host.
[01:43:03.698 --> 01:43:05.200]  She's got a lot of big points she wants to cover.
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:09.603]  Liz Wheeler is going to be joining us for the hour, and then Chase Geyser does the fourth hour.
[01:43:09.623 --> 01:43:10.684]  I'll host a little bit with Chase.
[01:43:11.425 --> 01:43:20.472]  And then tomorrow, we got some guests, but I also want to open the phones up on what would have happened if they killed Trump, because they're trying to do it again, and I know what's going to happen if they did.
[01:43:20.712 --> 01:43:21.392]  Or if they would have.
[01:43:21.492 --> 01:43:22.693]  I mean, it's bad.
[01:43:23.273 --> 01:43:25.814]  So, I mean, I'm a tough guy, folks.
[01:43:25.874 --> 01:43:26.734]  I can handle stress.
[01:43:27.534 --> 01:43:30.155]  But man, I am like on the edge of my seat.
[01:43:30.495 --> 01:43:32.336]  I am so concerned right now.
[01:43:32.976 --> 01:43:34.937]  And we just have to pray for Trump, pray for America.
[01:43:35.417 --> 01:43:37.878]  And we gotta just get all in on saving the country, folks.
[01:43:37.898 --> 01:43:38.938]  This is 100% real.
[01:43:39.358 --> 01:43:40.119]  Trump's 100% real.
[01:43:40.159 --> 01:43:42.099]  By the way, he's real.
[01:43:42.159 --> 01:43:42.940]  He runs himself.
[01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:43.820]  He loves America.
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:45.241]  He makes mistakes, but he's a good guy.
[01:43:46.081 --> 01:43:46.721]  And so is J.D.
[01:43:46.761 --> 01:43:47.061]  Vance.
[01:43:47.201 --> 01:43:48.642]  And that's why they hate him.
[01:43:50.242 --> 01:43:56.446]  All I can say is Trump getting shot and that man getting killed, Twitter's getting wounded, is not like a Netflix program.
[01:43:56.466 --> 01:44:02.010]  And I know you know that, but it's not just some new entertaining thing that happened.
[01:44:02.611 --> 01:44:05.933]  That means the deep state is willing to go all the way.
[01:44:08.475 --> 01:44:13.939]  And it means all the things they would do if they would have killed him, false flags guaranteed to blame Trump supporters to equal it out.
[01:44:13.959 --> 01:44:15.080]  They probably would have killed Biden.
[01:44:16.007 --> 01:44:17.808]  I mean, I know what they're planning.
[01:44:18.428 --> 01:44:21.129]  They don't know exactly what plan they're going to go with, but I know their plans.
[01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:22.389]  And I know you know their plans as well.
[01:44:23.609 --> 01:44:25.050]  And so we're on the edge of oblivion here.
[01:44:25.690 --> 01:44:29.431]  We're also on the edge of, I don't want to say a utopia, not Valhalla.
[01:44:29.751 --> 01:44:35.093]  I'm not like a leftist who promises everything free, but look at El Salvador with a good leader in three years.
[01:44:35.113 --> 01:44:35.633]  It's a 180.
[01:44:37.665 --> 01:44:45.348]  Humans have incredible potential when good people at the grassroots do the right thing and pray to God and are hardworking and true and honest and just.
[01:44:45.568 --> 01:44:48.970]  And then when the leaders are good, it's over.
[01:44:49.630 --> 01:44:50.830]  We can do anything.
[01:44:51.791 --> 01:44:53.671]  And we've been through decades of evil.
[01:44:55.932 --> 01:44:57.113]  And it's just time to turn it around.
[01:44:57.133 --> 01:44:58.774]  All right, we've got to go to break here in a few minutes.
[01:45:00.134 --> 01:45:02.175]  Please remember, we're Lister Supported.
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:20.688]  So when you go to drjonesnaturals.com for all the nano silver products, or next level foundational energy, or the Kama Chill, or the Rocket Rest Sleep Aid, or the Top Brain that's an amazing nootropic, they're great, you're gonna love them, you're gonna wish you'd have gone there earlier and gotten them at drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:45:20.708 --> 01:45:22.809]  Just drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:45:24.549 --> 01:45:30.152]  And then we've got all of these great sponsors that I've gone out and found the top people
[01:45:31.345 --> 01:45:35.748]  Because again, the CRO didn't order product, sabotages a shot of standing later, admitted all this.
[01:45:36.348 --> 01:45:36.768]  It's okay.
[01:45:37.269 --> 01:45:38.229]  Our supple's about to sell out.
[01:45:38.429 --> 01:45:41.251]  I'll go out and eat other topples and sell them to you that you really need.
[01:45:41.291 --> 01:45:43.092]  So this is beyond a green energy drink.
[01:45:43.112 --> 01:45:44.773]  This is a super food.
[01:45:45.253 --> 01:45:47.935]  It's way better than the top brands that are out there that are excellent, by the way.
[01:45:48.415 --> 01:45:49.136]  It is the best.
[01:45:49.396 --> 01:45:53.378]  OptimalHuman.com forward slash Alex for 25% off.
[01:45:53.418 --> 01:45:58.441]  Please support our sponsor, OptimalHealth.com forward slash Alex for 25% off.
[01:45:58.821 --> 01:45:59.902]  And here's a quick promo I shot.
[01:46:00.987 --> 01:46:10.833]  There are a lot of amazing green drinks out there, and the amount of evidence is just massive of how good they are for our whole bodies, but especially our guts.
[01:46:11.374 --> 01:46:14.055]  Our immune systems, our vitality, it's so important.
[01:46:14.095 --> 01:46:16.497]  But not all of them are made equal.
[01:46:17.237 --> 01:46:20.480]  I couldn't operate in the last 10 years without my morning green drink.
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:26.744]  And I'm telling you folks, when I started trying this product just about six months ago, it was game-changing.
[01:46:26.784 --> 01:46:30.026]  It was so much more powerful than any of the products I'd used before.
[01:46:30.746 --> 01:46:37.527]  Optimal Human is hands down the best concentrated green drink out there on the market.

[01:47:03.859 --> 01:47:06.081]  And this is what I call a total 360 win.
[01:47:06.482 --> 01:47:10.427]  It's the highest quality, it's a great price, and it supports the Infowar.
[01:47:10.947 --> 01:47:16.994]  OptimalHuman.com forward slash Alex, 25% off right off the top, and it funds the Infowar.

[01:47:27.137 --> 01:47:27.497]  It's amazing.
[01:47:27.517 --> 01:47:34.399]  Support the broadcast and boost your health at optimal human dot com forward slash Alex.
[01:47:45.445 --> 01:47:50.589]  This is a make it or break it moment, so I need people to connect those synapses in their brain for you to make a decision.
[01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:54.872]  If you don't support InfoWars, we will be shut down.
[01:47:54.892 --> 01:47:57.714]  And people say, well, they're constantly trying to shut you down.
[01:47:57.754 --> 01:47:58.495]  How are you still in the air?
[01:47:58.655 --> 01:47:58.935]  God.
[01:47:59.956 --> 01:48:01.037]  But God works through people.
[01:48:02.538 --> 01:48:07.862]  So, we're in a paradox here where the judge says we're open for three more months.
[01:48:09.563 --> 01:48:14.026]  If we're able to get a buyer under the law, they won't be able to shut us down.
[01:48:14.066 --> 01:48:14.947]  I'll just work with somebody else.
[01:48:15.871 --> 01:48:17.072]  And that's coming, that's got to be set up.
[01:48:18.253 --> 01:48:27.460]  But in the meantime, if people believe the news that we're being shut down everywhere, which they tried to do and failed, by that foregone conclusion we're shut down.
[01:48:27.580 --> 01:48:37.407]  And under the last federal bankruptcy manager who would not reorder product and killed all our advertising, he was positioning us to be shut down and tried to shut us down.
[01:48:38.468 --> 01:48:40.229]  We caught him, the judge caught him and fired him.
[01:48:41.711 --> 01:48:43.172]  We're almost sold out of all the products.
[01:48:44.008 --> 01:48:44.248]  All right?
[01:48:45.048 --> 01:48:47.789]  But we have a lot of great products that are still in stock.
[01:48:48.269 --> 01:48:49.009]  Limited supplies.
[01:48:49.069 --> 01:48:52.330]  So I need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:53.610]  And we just had a donation button.
[01:48:53.630 --> 01:48:54.390]  Maybe we should just do that.
[01:48:55.130 --> 01:48:57.891]  You're fighting for freedom in a key election, battling the globalists.
[01:48:57.911 --> 01:48:58.551]  We need support.
[01:48:59.291 --> 01:49:00.871]  But we want a long-term relationship with you.
[01:49:00.891 --> 01:49:02.831]  We want you to be symbiotic.
[01:49:02.851 --> 01:49:10.353]  We want you to get great products you like, get them delivered to you quickly, and enjoy them, and have them empower you, and make your life better so you love them and you keep getting them.
[01:49:10.373 --> 01:49:11.313]  We want a relationship.
[01:49:12.262 --> 01:49:18.025]  So, there's the InfoWars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[01:49:18.765 --> 01:49:26.009]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's saw palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[01:49:26.029 --> 01:49:30.471]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[01:49:30.531 --> 01:49:31.792]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[01:49:32.512 --> 01:49:43.195]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWars MD.
[01:49:43.555 --> 01:49:45.115]  We've got Ashwagandha Gummi.
[01:49:45.715 --> 01:49:49.016]  Relaxes you, makes you feel really relaxed with no downer feeling.
[01:49:49.876 --> 01:49:50.296]  Amazing.
[01:49:51.097 --> 01:49:51.937]  An incredible product.
[01:49:53.037 --> 01:49:53.877]  Goodnight Sleep.
[01:49:54.277 --> 01:49:55.358]  We have a lot of great sleep aids.
[01:49:55.398 --> 01:49:56.078]  This one's excellent.
[01:49:56.098 --> 01:49:57.238]  They're all different formulas.
[01:49:57.458 --> 01:49:57.978]  People love it.
[01:49:58.138 --> 01:49:58.919]  Goodnight Sleep.
[01:49:59.599 --> 01:50:00.319]  InfoWars MD.
[01:50:02.521 --> 01:50:07.323]  Ashwagandha with black pepper, which relaxes you and makes you lose weight.
[01:50:08.103 --> 01:50:09.024]  These are all concentrates.
[01:50:09.444 --> 01:50:10.364]  Joint Relief Max.
[01:50:10.544 --> 01:50:11.364]  Works really well.
[01:50:11.845 --> 01:50:12.705]  Great pain relief.
[01:50:12.865 --> 01:50:13.725]  Huge bottle of it.
[01:50:13.825 --> 01:50:14.666]  You know, jam-packed.
[01:50:15.126 --> 01:50:15.666]  It's there.
[01:50:16.186 --> 01:50:17.127]  Joint Relief Max.
[01:50:17.527 --> 01:50:18.567]  Infowars MD.
[01:50:18.927 --> 01:50:19.728]  Prostate support.
[01:50:19.788 --> 01:50:20.448]  Already mentioned that.
[01:50:21.088 --> 01:50:22.369]  This is just the top formula.
[01:50:22.389 --> 01:50:23.189]  Super high quality.
[01:50:23.569 --> 01:50:23.969]  Organic.
[01:50:24.549 --> 01:50:25.430]  Nerve Renew.
[01:50:26.090 --> 01:50:26.531]  Amazing.
[01:50:26.811 --> 01:50:29.313]  To get your nerves, not to kill pain, but to get your nerves healthy.
[01:50:29.493 --> 01:50:30.214]  Nitric Boost.
[01:50:30.394 --> 01:50:31.816]  Vitamin Refusion about to sell out.
[01:50:31.996 --> 01:50:32.656]  About to sell out.
[01:50:32.717 --> 01:50:33.577]  Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:50:33.758 --> 01:50:35.940]  And something I never talk about and should talk about more.
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:37.281]  Probiotic Fiber.
[01:50:37.441 --> 01:50:41.405]  A super high-end product at a low price at infowarstore.com.
[01:50:41.465 --> 01:50:42.466]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:50:42.486 --> 01:50:46.530]  The answer to 1984.
[01:50:48.641 --> 01:50:49.202]  Is 1776.
[01:50:51.083 --> 01:50:54.606]  Hour number three coming up with our special guest.
[01:50:55.407 --> 01:50:56.348]  You don't want to miss it.
[01:50:56.388 --> 01:50:57.168]  Liz Wheeler.
[01:50:57.248 --> 01:50:57.969]  Huge topics.
[01:50:58.429 --> 01:50:59.730]  Key analysis straight ahead.
[01:50:59.770 --> 01:51:01.252]  Wars has been banned.
[01:51:03.554 --> 01:51:04.094]  Arrested.
[01:51:04.374 --> 01:51:09.038]  Attacked and threatened.
[01:51:10.259 --> 01:51:11.901]  Because we are effective.
[01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:15.051]  The Great Awakening is here.
[01:51:15.371 --> 01:51:17.072]  Go to band.video.
[01:51:17.673 --> 01:51:19.854]  Download the videos and share.
[01:51:21.795 --> 01:51:26.098]  Support The Information War at infowarstore.com.
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:30.861]  And never give up the fight.
[01:51:31.281 --> 01:51:41.288]  InfoWars.com
[01:51:44.847 --> 01:51:52.934]  Hi, this is Jeff with DMO Knives and we are super excited to partner with Alex Jones for this style breacher knife from DMO.
[01:51:53.134 --> 01:51:58.819]  For a limited time, our tactical breacher through our Alex Jones partnership will be designed like this.
[01:51:59.139 --> 01:52:08.387]  We have our black over OD Cerakote, OD G10 composite handles with the following logos upon them.
[01:52:08.487 --> 01:52:12.111]  Betsy Ross flag over here with Alex Jones signature here.
[01:52:12.931 --> 01:52:15.592]  And then you flip that over, and we've got Donald Trump.
[01:52:15.993 --> 01:52:16.733]  Fight, fight, fight!
[01:52:17.233 --> 01:52:21.976]  We've had these things crammed in a Humvee, prying open a door in Syria.
[01:52:22.676 --> 01:52:23.857]  We've shot them at the range.
[01:52:24.377 --> 01:52:25.397]  They have survived.
[01:52:25.938 --> 01:52:27.278]  They have a lifetime guarantee.
[01:52:28.199 --> 01:52:30.340]  So if you ever break one, we'll replace it for you.
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:38.644]  To help develop the toughness, and sturdy, and durable, and usability, along with the beauty,
[01:52:39.424 --> 01:52:49.050]  There's four different heat stages that we put this thing through to come up with a dual level of hardness for usability and sturdiness.
[01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:51.191]  It's built to never fail the operator.
[01:52:51.932 --> 01:52:55.034]  Made in America, by Americans, for Americans.
[01:52:56.054 --> 01:53:01.039]  How much stronger can you get than the DMO quarter-inch thick steel breacher?
[01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:04.442]  Patriotic, strong, just like America.
[01:53:04.783 --> 01:53:14.332]  Again, we are super excited to team up with Alex Jones with DMO knives for this product, which is our patriotic tactical breacher.
[01:53:14.893 --> 01:53:16.494]  You can't get more patriotic than this.
[01:53:16.835 --> 01:53:18.096]  We can't wait to get them in your hands.
[01:53:18.496 --> 01:53:26.501]  In the last six months, as InfoWars has been fighting for its very existence, we've had a lot of great organizations and groups reach out wanting to support us.
[01:53:27.102 --> 01:53:29.744]  Well, I gotta tell you, Dead Moose Ops is one of the best.
[01:53:30.304 --> 01:53:39.370]  They put out some of the most amazing collectible limited edition knives and other amazing collectibles with folks like the Hodge Twins and so many others.
[01:53:39.910 --> 01:53:47.716]  These guys are bringing great products to the American people, and they're keeping some of the most important talk show hosts on the air as we win the fight against the globalists.
[01:53:47.776 --> 01:53:47.936]  So,
[01:53:49.278 --> 01:53:59.195]  We've decided to come out with 500 of their best-selling limited-edition knife engraved specifically for InfoWars.
[01:54:00.527 --> 01:54:01.127]  It's amazing.
[01:54:01.507 --> 01:54:07.770]  So here it is with the American flag, the original 13, Alex Jones, and it is such a storied knife.
[01:54:08.130 --> 01:54:10.271]  It's a special operations style knife.
[01:54:10.311 --> 01:54:14.213]  It's of the highest quality steel made right here in America in Arkansas.
[01:54:14.653 --> 01:54:23.397]  This knife cost over $115 to just produce because it's of the highest quality materials at the highest standards.
[01:54:23.437 --> 01:54:27.459]  And there's only 500 of these limited inscription knives
[01:54:28.059 --> 01:54:37.246]  With the original 13 Colonies flag, commissioned by George Washington, and laser inscribed with my signature, Alex Jones.
[01:54:37.506 --> 01:54:39.407]  This is a very important fundraiser.
[01:54:39.827 --> 01:54:44.831]  You know, on NPR and on PBS, you know, they get hundreds of millions of dollars in tax money every year.
[01:54:45.191 --> 01:54:48.293]  They will sell a coffee mug for $100 that'll cost $5.
[01:54:49.394 --> 01:54:53.397]  And you know you're getting memento to know you supported communism and evil and the New World Order.
[01:54:54.037 --> 01:54:58.880]  Well, this is a knife that cost over $115 because it's such high quality.
[01:54:59.140 --> 01:55:05.484]  And when you get the knife and you pay the extra money to fund the operation, you are changing the world.
[01:55:06.265 --> 01:55:12.568]  So if you want a limited edition knife that is simply amazing, read all about it right now at dmonives.com.
[01:55:13.809 --> 01:55:16.150]  It is dmonives.com.
[01:55:16.691 --> 01:55:18.412]  This is a true piece of Americana.
[01:55:19.012 --> 01:55:19.673]  Well, the mighty
[01:55:42.023 --> 01:55:45.425]  Liz Wheeler, popular talk show host, great investigative journalist, joins us.
[01:55:45.745 --> 01:55:46.866]  LizWheeler.com.
[01:55:47.106 --> 01:55:52.989]  Liz underscore Wheeler on X. And I wanted to get her on the show, and I told her, hey, what are we on about?
[01:55:53.049 --> 01:55:58.011]  I said, I want to hear your topics, because I love following her on X, tuned to her show, been a guest on her show a few times before.
[01:55:58.672 --> 01:56:00.413]  And she sent a great list of topics.
[01:56:00.453 --> 01:56:00.733]  J.D.
[01:56:00.773 --> 01:56:01.933]  Vance's weird narrative.
[01:56:02.273 --> 01:56:03.874]  Trump needs to move to the right, not the center.
[01:56:03.894 --> 01:56:04.395]  I agree with that.
[01:56:04.755 --> 01:56:05.715]  Kamala's a Marxist.
[01:56:07.436 --> 01:56:09.039]  Is planning to cheat in 2024.
[01:56:09.299 --> 01:56:10.100]  It's already begun.
[01:56:10.541 --> 01:56:12.003]  Yeah, she wants to ban guns.
[01:56:12.103 --> 01:56:16.048]  She's got all these clips we played days ago of her saying we're gonna make everybody equal.
[01:56:16.108 --> 01:56:18.391]  Well, you do that by chopping folks legs off.
[01:56:18.792 --> 01:56:19.493]  There's no such thing.
[01:56:19.513 --> 01:56:21.676]  Look at Venezuela right now.
[01:56:21.736 --> 01:56:23.619]  But I really love the point you hone in on.
[01:56:24.815 --> 01:56:27.397]  Liz, it's great to have you with us.
[01:56:41.607 --> 01:56:42.227]  The rebels.
[01:56:42.267 --> 01:56:45.868]  You want to be the black sheep in a system where evil is running things.
[01:56:46.328 --> 01:56:50.889]  As George Orwell said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[01:56:50.929 --> 01:56:52.669]  So Liz, great to have you here.
[01:56:52.689 --> 01:57:03.931]  I want to get all your thoughts on the assassination attempt, what's coming next, and your key point about stop letting the left and the corporate system and the globalists set the benchmark as if they're the arbiters of what we say and what we do.
[01:57:04.171 --> 01:57:05.472]  We want to be attacked by them.
[01:57:05.712 --> 01:57:07.612]  The people are ready worldwide, not just here.
[01:57:09.192 --> 01:57:10.253]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:57:10.453 --> 01:57:10.853]  The J.D.
[01:57:10.913 --> 01:57:15.195]  Vance is weird narrative, and we're talking about it on the show today or on the show tonight.
[01:57:15.235 --> 01:57:16.836]  You can go to YouTube to watch that.
[01:57:17.156 --> 01:57:20.358]  But I don't understand why some conservatives are like, oh no, J.D.
[01:57:20.378 --> 01:57:21.758]  Vance is being attacked by the left.
[01:57:21.778 --> 01:57:25.420]  They're calling him, gasp, God forbid, weird.
[01:57:25.821 --> 01:57:27.161]  Maybe Trump should have picked someone else.
[01:57:27.341 --> 01:57:28.202]  Like, no, no, no.
[01:57:28.522 --> 01:57:30.523]  This actually shows that J.D.
[01:57:30.563 --> 01:57:32.864]  Vance is a threat to their agenda.
[01:57:33.104 --> 01:57:38.247]  They wouldn't unleash these types of attacks on Marco Rubio or an establishment figure.
[01:57:38.627 --> 01:57:38.887]  J.D.
[01:57:38.947 --> 01:57:40.189]  Vance is based.
[01:57:40.549 --> 01:57:51.821]  He is a conservative, Christian, white man with children, happily married, who loves God, goes to church, loves his country, and that's an existential threat to the Marxist agenda.
[01:57:52.082 --> 01:57:52.522]  The J.D.
[01:57:52.582 --> 01:57:56.787]  Vance is weird narrative should be responded to by Trump.
[01:57:57.347 --> 01:57:59.207]  With no apologies whatsoever.
[01:57:59.227 --> 01:58:00.648]  They should be like, who are you calling weird?
[01:58:00.968 --> 01:58:03.248]  This is coming from the party that thinks men can be women.
[01:58:03.649 --> 01:58:11.731]  Coming from the Biden administration, who had that weird Hup Handler luggage thief as a member in the White House, as an employee in the White House.
[01:58:12.031 --> 01:58:15.511]  Coming from the pervs who want to give children pornography in school.
[01:58:15.892 --> 01:58:21.073]  Coming from the sexual perverts who think that throuples and polycules are the way to go.
[01:58:21.393 --> 01:58:25.134]  Like, if we want to talk about weird, the Democrat Party can show us what weird is.
[01:58:25.934 --> 01:58:36.482]  But what Trump should do, in my opinion, this is what I've told them before, and I'm hoping that they take this strategy to heart, is the answer to this is to be based.
[01:58:36.982 --> 01:58:43.948]  And what I mean when I say being based is, Alex, I'm sure you've noticed this, the Democrats have something that Republicans don't have.
[01:58:44.508 --> 01:58:46.850]  The Democrats have a killer instinct.
[01:58:47.230 --> 01:58:49.171]  They want it so bad.
[01:58:49.492 --> 01:58:52.314]  They want victory like a shark that smells blood.
[01:58:52.594 --> 01:58:55.576]  They will just gut you at the very first opportunity.
[01:58:56.056 --> 01:58:58.258]  And in a sense, I kind of respect that.
[01:58:58.658 --> 01:59:03.101]  In a sense, I don't respect them committing crimes and stealing and cheating and lying.
[01:59:03.401 --> 01:59:07.124]  But in a sense, Republicans don't actually have that same killer instinct.
[01:59:07.144 --> 01:59:08.965]  We just have moral superiority.
[01:59:09.486 --> 01:59:12.988]  And I wish that Republicans would want victory as much as Democrats.
[01:59:13.008 --> 01:59:13.849]  Because if they did,
[01:59:14.409 --> 01:59:16.030]  Kamala Harris is a communist.
[01:59:16.150 --> 01:59:16.950]  She's a Marxist.
[01:59:17.250 --> 01:59:22.572]  She has the most atrocious record in her public life of almost any politician I can think of.
[01:59:22.773 --> 01:59:28.355]  There's plenty of ammunition for Trump to be based if he chooses to do that versus scooching towards the center.
[01:59:29.204 --> 01:59:29.524]  I agree.
[01:59:29.564 --> 01:59:34.786]  I mean, I think it was good in Milwaukee that he was magnanimous and tried to bring people together.
[01:59:35.427 --> 01:59:37.627]  But he can do that in general for those that aren't the establishment.
[01:59:37.648 --> 01:59:42.169]  The establishment, he's got to level his political guns at them and destroy them politically, nonviolently.
[01:59:42.590 --> 01:59:49.232]  He's got to just point out that they are cancer and they are a ravenous group of criminals using psychological warfare, behavioral psychology.
[01:59:49.512 --> 01:59:53.094]  They want to literally cut our daughter's breast off, cut our son's genitals off.
[01:59:53.794 --> 01:59:55.035]  They're a psychotic cult.
[01:59:55.655 --> 01:59:58.056]  And so, yeah, to these psychos, normal people look weird.
[02:00:00.379 --> 02:00:02.881]  Yeah, I mean, they probably don't think that J.D.
[02:00:02.921 --> 02:00:03.641]  Vance is weird.
[02:00:03.681 --> 02:00:08.944]  They probably just focus grouped it and found that with liberal women, the word weird resonates.
[02:00:09.084 --> 02:00:15.128]  They can portray him as being a creepy internet guy, and that resonates with the liberal women they need to turn out to vote for Kamala.
[02:00:15.788 --> 02:00:17.269]  I don't even know if they think he's weird.
[02:00:17.309 --> 02:00:19.411]  They just think that he's an existential threat.
[02:00:19.431 --> 02:00:21.813]  Listen, on my show, I talk about Antonio Gramsci all the time.
[02:00:22.114 --> 02:00:28.219]  I'm sure your viewers are very familiar with this Italian Marxist who wrote a book called Prison Notebooks.
[02:00:28.259 --> 02:00:30.921]  He was imprisoned by Mussolini, actually, in fascist Italy.
[02:00:31.282 --> 02:00:39.649]  And he wrote this series of notebooks observing why, when communist revolutions are successful, or Marxist revolutions, why they're successful.
[02:00:39.989 --> 02:00:47.912]  When they're successful, and he noted that most successful Marxist revolutions aren't successful because they topple the government or revolutionaries topple the government.
[02:00:48.212 --> 02:00:52.854]  They're successful when they achieve cultural hegemony, when they take over the culture first.
[02:00:53.274 --> 02:00:54.414]  That's why J.D.
[02:00:54.474 --> 02:00:56.875]  Vance is a threat to these Marxists, because J.D.
[02:00:56.915 --> 02:00:58.396]  Vance is standing for the family.
[02:00:58.436 --> 02:01:00.937]  Like I said, he's happily married with a wife.
[02:01:01.417 --> 02:01:02.318]  He has children.
[02:01:02.338 --> 02:01:03.318]  He loves God.
[02:01:03.598 --> 02:01:09.562]  He wants our society to be centered around what's best for the nuclear family, not just for selfish individuals.
[02:01:09.902 --> 02:01:22.009]  And how on earth are these Marxists supposed to take over the family and destroy it with gender ideology and feminism and globalism and selfishness if you have someone who is unwavering in their principles like J.D.
[02:01:22.029 --> 02:01:22.289]  Vance?
[02:01:22.529 --> 02:01:25.031]  Listen, I was critical actually, Maya Culpehere of J.D.
[02:01:25.051 --> 02:01:32.576]  Vance about a week before Trump announced him as vice presidential running mate because I thought he was moving to the center on his abortion narrative.
[02:01:32.856 --> 02:01:34.057]  And I still disagree with that.
[02:01:34.437 --> 02:01:41.141]  But that does not take away from the fact that this man is a man of principle first, not a politician.
[02:01:41.502 --> 02:01:49.407]  And we have very few of those people in the United States Congress, let alone ever touching the Oval Office in the White House.
[02:01:49.487 --> 02:01:52.449]  So I think that's why we have all these leftists frothing at the mouth.
[02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:53.190]  Well, you're right.
[02:01:53.810 --> 02:01:55.912]  Their hatred of him tells us all we need to know.
[02:01:56.973 --> 02:01:57.133]  Yeah.
[02:01:58.114 --> 02:02:10.885]  And I was struck when I met with him in, I guess like six weeks or five weeks ago in Detroit for a TPUSA action event, I spoke right before him, that he was not like a politician.
[02:02:10.905 --> 02:02:15.589]  I went, talked to him in his green room, talked to him, she was stabbed, big lessor for a long time.
[02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:18.632]  And he just said, I said, yeah, I hear you're in the running.
[02:02:18.652 --> 02:02:19.293]  He goes, yeah, I got it.
[02:02:20.046 --> 02:02:22.727]  When he told me, I've got it, he didn't even say, don't tell anybody.
[02:02:23.027 --> 02:02:24.268]  He was just such a regular guy.
[02:02:24.288 --> 02:02:26.869]  He knew I wouldn't even say anything about it.
[02:02:27.850 --> 02:02:30.511]  And so that was really, that was a big secret.
[02:02:30.531 --> 02:02:31.371]  And of course I kept it.
[02:02:32.652 --> 02:02:36.994]  Like when Joe Rogan told me four months before I went to Spotify that he'd already done the deal, kind of insider traded, whatever.
[02:02:37.054 --> 02:02:39.415]  Joe trusted me, he told me, he knows that stuff's off record.
[02:02:39.435 --> 02:02:41.376]  But Vance didn't even say, this is off record.
[02:02:41.416 --> 02:02:42.477]  He said, yeah, no, I got it.
[02:02:43.097 --> 02:02:43.697]  I was like, well, great.
[02:02:43.717 --> 02:02:45.018]  Well, once you get in, let's do this and that.
[02:02:45.038 --> 02:02:46.799]  And this is how Obama stayed behind networks.
[02:02:46.819 --> 02:02:47.119]  He goes, yeah.
[02:02:47.699 --> 02:02:48.940]  Here's what Chief of Staff briefed him.
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:49.941]  We know you're an expert on it.
[02:02:50.221 --> 02:02:51.742]  We want to stop the networks when we get in.
[02:02:51.762 --> 02:02:56.265]  And our conversation was about stopping the networks, the leftists, once Trump gets back in.
[02:02:56.585 --> 02:02:59.727]  How does Trump not kill them, not put them in prison, just fire their asses?
[02:02:59.767 --> 02:03:01.328]  We had a good discussion about that.
[02:03:01.408 --> 02:03:02.929]  Got Chief of Staff's info.
[02:03:02.969 --> 02:03:04.430]  And that's got to scare the deep state.
[02:03:04.650 --> 02:03:06.751]  Because Vance was like, by the way, you're an expert on the deep state.
[02:03:06.771 --> 02:03:08.553]  We want to work with you on finding out who they are.
[02:03:09.733 --> 02:03:10.634]  He should be thinking about that.
[02:03:10.934 --> 02:03:11.915]  He was already thinking way ahead.
[02:03:13.567 --> 02:03:16.949]  Yeah, and I love to hear that because you and I have both been talking about this for a long time.
[02:03:16.989 --> 02:03:21.251]  And it started out, it was actually an unpopular thing to talk about because it's wonky and boring sounding.
[02:03:21.511 --> 02:03:25.434]  When you talk about the administrative state, people are like, okay, nerds, what are you talking about?
[02:03:25.494 --> 02:03:26.774]  Employees of the federal government.
[02:03:27.135 --> 02:03:34.859]  But it's fortunately become a little bit more exposed for what it is, these unelected bureaucrats and federal agencies that are making laws that we
[02:03:35.499 --> 02:03:37.020]  The swamp is the permanent deep state.
[02:03:54.415 --> 02:04:05.105]  Look, there was a couple big articles out about this today where people explained like the good Trump people are scared to criticize the deep state as they're being brought in for the administration even ahead of time because they don't want to get fired.
[02:04:05.145 --> 02:04:07.127]  No, they've got to go on the offense against them.
[02:04:07.528 --> 02:04:09.670]  Everybody knew what I was telling Trump was true.
[02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:13.453]  They were all just scared other than General Flynn, Steve Bannon, myself.
[02:04:13.533 --> 02:04:15.335]  That's who had to then be kicked out.
[02:04:15.355 --> 02:04:19.379]  I didn't want to be the administration, but I was willing to sit there and
[02:04:19.639 --> 02:04:22.080]  Tell him, hey, do a Google search on this lady.
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:23.600]  Do a Google search on that guy.
[02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:25.940]  You know this person's on Soros' board of directors?
[02:04:26.841 --> 02:04:27.401]  Really, Alex?
[02:04:27.881 --> 02:04:28.341]  Hold on.
[02:04:28.381 --> 02:04:28.801]  Look into that.
[02:04:28.841 --> 02:04:29.561]  Is that true?
[02:04:30.661 --> 02:04:32.822]  And boy, they went ape crap.
[02:04:32.922 --> 02:04:37.183]  They had a 60-minute show about me being mean to Fiona Hill and other staffers.
[02:04:37.643 --> 02:04:40.024]  I just sent them a report of these people did this.
[02:04:40.104 --> 02:04:40.784]  They said this.
[02:04:41.164 --> 02:04:45.765]  I'd give them, like, the person's name, three quotes attacking Trump, digital copy, links to it.
[02:04:46.778 --> 02:04:48.919]  And then how they work for the globalists.
[02:04:48.959 --> 02:04:49.719]  I mean, it's easy.
[02:04:49.759 --> 02:04:52.520]  We can beat these people easy, but we gotta go to war with them.
[02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:56.461]  And going to war with them means we simply, what the left does to us, deplatforming us.
[02:04:56.781 --> 02:04:57.801]  We're not gonna take their bank accounts.
[02:04:58.101 --> 02:05:00.782]  We're not gonna put them, you know, unless they committed a crime, in jail.
[02:05:01.062 --> 02:05:03.403]  We're just gonna spotlight them and remove them from government.
[02:05:04.997 --> 02:05:07.418]  Well, I don't believe in this idea of political amnesty.
[02:05:07.558 --> 02:05:18.280]  And when I say political amnesty, I mean that someone had a bad opinion about a political issue, say they were a never-Trumper, and then all of a sudden, when it becomes politically expedient for them, they want to be on Team Trump.
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:24.222]  That is, to me, a sign that that person is pursuing power, or a sign that the person is not a principled person.
[02:05:24.502 --> 02:05:25.562]  And I'll give you an example here.
[02:05:25.862 --> 02:05:32.428]  I think that the Trump campaign right now is still suffering from some of these deep staters trying to infiltrate into his inner circle, giving him bad advice.
[02:05:32.728 --> 02:05:34.429]  We see all this drama about Project 2025.
[02:05:35.070 --> 02:05:39.374]  Well, who's whispering in President Trump's ear, telling him that Project 2025 is bad?
[02:05:39.694 --> 02:05:41.055]  Who's giving him false information?
[02:05:41.135 --> 02:05:50.223]  Why are they trying to move him away from this project, which would, the policy recommendations in Project 2025 would help drain the swamp once the Trump administration gains the White House again.
[02:05:50.583 --> 02:06:01.746]  Well, could it be that one of his campaign managers, it was previously a Never Trumper, was previously an advocate of jailing the protesters that were outside the Capitol on January 6th?
[02:06:01.846 --> 02:06:04.126]  Why is this person so near to Donald Trump?
[02:06:04.186 --> 02:06:06.106]  Why does this person have Donald Trump's ear?
[02:06:06.567 --> 02:06:13.508]  It's, I understand, I don't necessarily blame Donald Trump for this, I just think when you're betting people around you, you have to be ruthless.
[02:06:13.528 --> 02:06:17.149]  You can't say- No, no, absolutely, absolutely, but I've got like- And we forgive you.
[02:06:17.389 --> 02:06:19.750]  I've got like 50 employees and they're all loyal and they're great.
[02:06:19.810 --> 02:06:21.731]  If they weren't on my side, they could screw me over really quick.
[02:06:21.771 --> 02:06:23.171]  And some have tried, they're gone now.
[02:06:23.471 --> 02:06:24.112]  Some infiltrators.
[02:06:24.672 --> 02:06:26.953]  But I'm not disagreeing with you, Liz Wheeler, but it's a paradox.
[02:06:27.813 --> 02:06:28.734]  Eight years ago, J.D.
[02:06:28.774 --> 02:06:30.094]  Vance is anti-Trump.
[02:06:30.574 --> 02:06:35.096]  He wakes up and then for eight years is pro-Trump, has a good track record, Trump trusts him.
[02:06:35.136 --> 02:06:41.639]  So I agree that some newly flipped anti-Trump are to Trump we can't trust, but there's also a paradox there.
[02:06:42.639 --> 02:06:50.623]  I mean, Musk was never an anti-Trumper, but now he's come over to our side, so we've got to also look at what they produce and what they've stood for since then.
[02:06:50.643 --> 02:06:51.903]  You know, you judge a tree by its fruit.
[02:06:51.923 --> 02:06:52.444]  Well, here's how I tell.
[02:06:53.244 --> 02:06:58.726]  Here's how I tell if something—since I'm a practicing Christian, a Catholic Christian, I believe in conversion, of course, and redemption.
[02:06:59.027 --> 02:07:05.870]  But there's a way that you can tell whether someone has had a conversion and redemption, or whether they are just playing the politically expedient game.
[02:07:06.130 --> 02:07:08.091]  And that is, are they willing to talk about it?
[02:07:08.131 --> 02:07:10.412]  Do they actually say, here's my conversion story?
[02:07:10.592 --> 02:07:14.313]  Think of anybody from David Horowitz, who was like, yeah, I used to be a communist radical.
[02:07:14.553 --> 02:07:17.715]  Here's what changed my mind, to even Donald Trump on abortion.
[02:07:17.935 --> 02:07:20.456]  You know, back when he was a Hollywood celebrity, he was pro-abortion.
[02:07:20.476 --> 02:07:23.437]  Then he said, actually, I had a friend who got a woman pregnant.
[02:07:24.197 --> 02:07:26.798]  The child was born, and he was like, oh my goodness, I can't be pro-abortion anymore.
[02:07:26.818 --> 02:07:28.399]  I realized what this actually means.
[02:07:28.719 --> 02:07:29.579]  Well, that's the same with J.D.
[02:07:29.619 --> 02:07:29.899]  Vance.
[02:07:29.919 --> 02:07:31.800]  He talks about, yeah, I was wrong about that.
[02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:32.280]  Here's why.
[02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:33.340]  Here's what changed my mind.
[02:07:33.881 --> 02:07:36.682]  I mean, like every other person- Liz, you're totally right.
[02:07:36.702 --> 02:07:37.402]  You're totally right.
[02:07:37.462 --> 02:07:40.483]  They've got to come out- I'm willing to give someone a second chance if they prove themselves.
[02:07:40.543 --> 02:07:49.929]  Congress, this isn't some communist struggle session or some truth commission, but if you are converted to the truth, you're going to have the fact that you're speaking out about it.
[02:07:50.930 --> 02:07:51.070]  Yeah.
[02:07:51.790 --> 02:07:55.793]  You're going to want to tell people that story because you're going to want it to resonate with other people like you.
[02:07:56.193 --> 02:08:04.678]  It's like my own conversion from being more libertarian-minded of a conservative to now being a huge proponent of ordered liberty.
[02:08:04.718 --> 02:08:05.919]  Libertarianism doesn't work.
[02:08:06.039 --> 02:08:09.061]  I used to think that anything that the government did that encroached
[02:08:09.241 --> 02:08:11.362]  On your individual liberty was bad.
[02:08:11.402 --> 02:08:12.143]  We couldn't do that.
[02:08:12.183 --> 02:08:14.805]  We couldn't have any kind of religion in government.
[02:08:14.885 --> 02:08:18.047]  Even conservative principles couldn't be tinged at all with moral beliefs.
[02:08:18.387 --> 02:08:19.488]  Now I realize that's stupid.
[02:08:19.508 --> 02:08:35.678]  And so I talk about that all the time because I want people who thought the way that I thought to now think the way that I think, understanding that actually our government is built on the idea of morality and not morality as defined by people, but morality as it's been given to us by God.
[02:08:36.138 --> 02:08:36.578]  We're good to go.
[02:08:52.574 --> 02:08:55.095]  Well, I mean, yeah, the left doesn't understand this.
[02:08:55.335 --> 02:09:03.479]  Twenty-five years ago, I admitted that when I was really young, I took part in abortions, and I thought it was just a blob, and I believed the lies, and I was a teenager, and I did it.
[02:09:03.820 --> 02:09:09.222]  Later, God touched my heart, and I repented, and I tell the story all the time about it was wrong, the most valuable thing in my life, my children.
[02:09:09.242 --> 02:09:10.083]  I have four children now.
[02:09:10.383 --> 02:09:11.623]  Couldn't imagine doing that now.
[02:09:12.064 --> 02:09:13.104]  I couldn't imagine doing it since I was like 18.
[02:09:13.184 --> 02:09:17.346]  I've not been involved in abortions since I was like 18, but God touched my heart.
[02:09:17.766 --> 02:09:18.407]  And the left goes,
[02:09:19.207 --> 02:09:19.947]  You're a hypocrite.
[02:09:20.307 --> 02:09:23.048]  You were involved in abortions and now you're against them.
[02:09:23.088 --> 02:09:23.768]  No, it's the opposite.
[02:09:23.828 --> 02:09:24.869]  I admit I'm wrong.
[02:09:24.889 --> 02:09:25.809]  I admit I sinned.
[02:09:25.889 --> 02:09:43.834]  I've repented and now I've stood up against abortion and protested it hundreds of times and had hundreds and hundreds of anti-abortion guests on and I'm not saying I'm a great guy but I've definitely balanced out killing a few of my children versus the hundreds of thousands we probably saved and I'm not saying I'm a hero but I've definitely gone the right and I want to tell that.
[02:09:43.914 --> 02:09:45.415]  I want to say I was wrong.
[02:09:45.495 --> 02:09:45.895]  I want
[02:09:46.195 --> 02:09:49.096]  To not just be like, oh, you're going to hell, you had an abortion, I'm judging you.
[02:09:49.156 --> 02:09:50.516]  I'm like, no, no, God can forgive you.
[02:09:50.856 --> 02:09:52.456]  And I tell that story because that's on my heart.
[02:09:52.536 --> 02:09:54.577]  I totally agree with you.
[02:09:54.817 --> 02:09:55.017]  Yeah.
[02:09:55.037 --> 02:09:57.497]  I mean, it's the biblical principle of using evil for good.
[02:09:57.557 --> 02:10:01.838]  God can turn anything bad into something good if we allow him to give us the grace to do that.
[02:10:02.138 --> 02:10:05.359]  And that's the same, that's the same sort of principle I like to apply to the government.
[02:10:05.459 --> 02:10:12.880]  Unfortunately, I don't think a lot of these deep state actors, these politicians do have, I mean, I don't think they have principles to begin with, let alone conversion stories or redemption.
[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:15.041]  I think most of them should be completely raised
[02:10:36.810 --> 02:10:46.220]  And then very, very small, only necessary functions farmed out to agencies that can prove that they were never abusive to our rights as American citizens.
[02:10:46.260 --> 02:10:54.109]  I'm not sure that there is a federal agency that qualifies, that there is a federal agency that could stand before us and say, Alex, Liz, I have not violated your rights at any point.
[02:10:55.210 --> 02:10:56.031]  Maybe the Coast Guard?
[02:10:59.264 --> 02:10:59.524]  All right.
[02:10:59.604 --> 02:10:59.944]  Maybe.
[02:10:59.964 --> 02:11:03.366]  I mean, the military is so woke at this point, I'm not even sure they could make that argument.
[02:11:03.626 --> 02:11:03.947]  Well, no.
[02:11:03.987 --> 02:11:08.509]  I mean, no, they've had the rest of the military involved domestically, and they do the worst stuff to the military itself.
[02:11:08.549 --> 02:11:11.671]  So the military grassroots is great, in my experience, best people.
[02:11:11.691 --> 02:11:14.112]  But as you go up, obviously, evil wants power.
[02:11:14.152 --> 02:11:15.873]  So at the top, it's about the worst thing we've got.
[02:11:16.634 --> 02:11:18.515]  So let's go to a paradox here, because
[02:11:19.622 --> 02:11:19.962]  I don't think so.
[02:11:39.568 --> 02:11:40.369]  The American ethos.
[02:11:40.389 --> 02:11:57.315]  But then I look at the statistics of single white women particularly, almost 70% voting Democrat, and these studies that keep coming out where it's women in general, but white women in general, that are, I think the state's their father, the state's their brother, the state's their husband.
[02:11:58.337 --> 02:11:59.437]  I don't know.
[02:12:21.434 --> 02:12:27.518]  He said we need to empower women to have children and think about how powerful that is if they want to.
[02:12:28.139 --> 02:12:37.245]  But he also, as I've read his book and read his speeches and talked to him and seen his clips, he said we're depopulating just like Elon Musk said.
[02:12:37.265 --> 02:12:43.710]  So he just said in general we should honor motherhood and honor family and honor children instead of trying to mutilate them and destroy them.
[02:12:44.050 --> 02:12:49.214]  She turns that into you want more white kids as if more white kids or any kids is bad.
[02:12:49.534 --> 02:12:50.354]  This is so sick.
[02:12:50.394 --> 02:12:50.875]  Here's a clip.
[02:12:52.479 --> 02:12:56.202]  More and more Americans choosing not to have kids, which again emphasizes why J.D.
[02:12:56.242 --> 02:13:00.385]  Vance's comments about childless Americans, childless cat ladies, could be so politically damaging.
[02:13:00.545 --> 02:13:05.488]  Well, so what's interesting is this is this natalism that comes from an authoritarian playbook, right?
[02:13:05.528 --> 02:13:08.230]  That there need to be more white children.
[02:13:08.450 --> 02:13:13.713]  I can show you a whole bunch of clips of Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, all of them saying, we're getting rid of white people, that's a good thing.
[02:13:13.833 --> 02:13:15.574]  So they're the ones that make it anti-white.
[02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:42.532]  But then Vance just says we should honor the family and honor mothers and honor children.
[02:13:42.552 --> 02:13:45.314]  And then she turns it into a white thing.
[02:13:46.867 --> 02:13:52.170]  And it's just so transparent what they're doing, and it's totally blowing up in their face.
[02:13:52.230 --> 02:13:55.732]  And I don't know this woman, but I want to bet she probably doesn't have any children.
[02:13:56.132 --> 02:13:57.573]  And it's true, the statistics show it.
[02:13:57.613 --> 02:14:08.740]  The average woman that buys into leftism by about 40 tries to reject it, tries to have children, or they're lesbians and they have the CPS go kidnap Christian children, you know, and then give them to them.
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:11.001]  And so they're, like, hunting us.
[02:14:11.041 --> 02:14:13.403]  You know, they're not following the regular biological system.
[02:14:13.863 --> 02:14:16.065]  And I'm not attacking people because they're homosexual.
[02:14:16.085 --> 02:14:16.965]  That's between you and God.
[02:14:17.326 --> 02:14:19.948]  My point is, is that you're force-feeding this on us.
[02:14:20.328 --> 02:14:24.251]  You're, like, hunting us like planet of the apes, rounding us up to farm us.
[02:14:24.911 --> 02:14:25.572]  And then J.D.
[02:14:25.632 --> 02:14:28.454]  Vance says we should have more children, and you spin it into a race.
[02:14:28.854 --> 02:14:30.495]  I mean, these are just disgusting people.
[02:14:30.535 --> 02:14:31.316]  What do you say to this lady?
[02:14:32.921 --> 02:14:33.261]  It is.
[02:14:33.421 --> 02:14:34.802]  Well, it is disgusting, too.
[02:14:34.842 --> 02:14:40.384]  I mean, I just gave birth four months ago, so I can tell you firsthand that children are the most wonderful thing.
[02:14:40.744 --> 02:14:47.787]  Every parent knows this, that your life is just never the same after you have a child because there's nothing more fulfilling than shepherding this soul and these sweet little babies.
[02:14:48.247 --> 02:14:51.789]  I could, you know, gush and rave about my children all day long here.
[02:14:51.809 --> 02:14:55.070]  And the point of it is that this woman's missing out.
[02:14:55.250 --> 02:14:57.572]  This is what feminism does to women.
[02:14:57.612 --> 02:15:04.696]  If you look at that woman, Molly Jong Fast, she's a perfect example of this radical Marxist feminist narrative and how it warps and twists women.
[02:15:04.716 --> 02:15:11.761]  Well think about it, a woman is literally made as the center of the human community to create the next generation.
[02:15:12.661 --> 02:15:15.742]  Everything and every animal system is based around reproduction.
[02:15:15.822 --> 02:15:16.803]  It's what we are.
[02:15:17.103 --> 02:15:22.645]  And they're literally rejecting who they are and then mad at us because we have been part of it and experienced.
[02:15:23.245 --> 02:15:27.206]  Nothing compares to children and the love of children other than the Holy Ghost.
[02:15:27.726 --> 02:15:31.788]  I mean, it goes, it goes, it goes God, children, and then your wife.
[02:15:32.268 --> 02:15:33.848]  And I'm a man, so maybe you said your husband.
[02:15:34.109 --> 02:15:35.809]  It goes God, children, and your wife.
[02:15:36.129 --> 02:15:38.090]  I mean, there's nothing even compares to that.
[02:15:39.465 --> 02:15:40.505]  No, there's nothing compared to it.
[02:15:40.525 --> 02:15:41.786]  But this is the thing, though.
[02:15:42.026 --> 02:16:02.170]  This feminist idea that you have to have a career to be empowered, that you have to be sexually promiscuous to be liberated, that you should reject children so that you can have luxury and convenience, it creates bitter, agenda-driven, unhappy women who can't stand other women seeking fulfillment in their womanhood, right?
[02:16:02.250 --> 02:16:06.171]  And the reason for this is because feminism, if you go back, and I'm sure you have, I'm sure your viewers have,
[02:16:06.391 --> 02:16:07.932]  The CIA, Gloria Steinem.
[02:16:26.528 --> 02:16:31.854]  Children, they try to kill children, and if they don't succeed in butchering them in the womb, then they butcher them with gender ideology.
[02:16:32.114 --> 02:16:42.146]  They have to destroy marriage, the family, and children in order to do this cultural hegemony thing where they take over the culture first before they topple the governmental institutions.
[02:16:42.895 --> 02:16:43.536]  Well, that's right.
[02:16:43.676 --> 02:16:45.397]  And I'm not proud of the fact that I got divorced.
[02:16:45.437 --> 02:16:46.198]  My ex-wife divorced me.
[02:16:46.218 --> 02:16:48.820]  I had three children with her, and I have another child with my second wife.
[02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:49.381]  It was amazing.
[02:16:49.841 --> 02:16:57.988]  But both my ex-wife and my current wife, at Whole Foods or other places, have been confronted many times by angry women, particularly my ex-wife.
[02:16:58.329 --> 02:17:00.210]  They would get jealous that she had three children with her.
[02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:02.292]  They would get pissed and say, why are you having so many kids?
[02:17:02.552 --> 02:17:03.653]  They literally envy it.
[02:17:03.693 --> 02:17:04.174]  They hate it.
[02:17:06.365 --> 02:17:13.389]  They do, because there's an innate biological and spiritual desire in every woman to have children, to nurture children.
[02:17:13.449 --> 02:17:14.969]  It's an eternal calling.
[02:17:15.009 --> 02:17:16.190]  It's not just something on Earth.
[02:17:16.590 --> 02:17:18.691]  It is the way that we are larger than ourselves.
[02:17:18.711 --> 02:17:22.073]  The way that we seek eternity is through shepherding these souls through this life.
[02:17:22.093 --> 02:17:23.974]  And so these women, they can tamp it down.
[02:17:24.014 --> 02:17:24.634]  They can warp it.
[02:17:24.674 --> 02:17:25.375]  They can destroy it.
[02:17:25.395 --> 02:17:26.375]  They can abort their children.
[02:17:26.415 --> 02:17:28.396]  They can pretend like children are just inconvenient.
[02:17:28.676 --> 02:17:29.096]  Whatever.
[02:17:29.196 --> 02:17:30.957]  It's all a lie, and these women know it.
[02:17:30.977 --> 02:17:31.918]  You know what's interesting, Alex?
[02:17:32.538 --> 02:17:43.864]  This is something positive that I see in Gen Z. I don't often have positive things to say about Gen Z, but one of the things that I've noticed is young Gen Z women specifically are starting to reject the feminist narrative.
[02:17:43.884 --> 02:17:54.070]  They're starting to say, wait a second, this nine to five career that you prioritize over getting married, that you never have children, that you abort children, that you don't do any of your own housework, you don't create a home for your family.
[02:17:54.090 --> 02:17:55.251]  This isn't fulfilling.
[02:17:55.291 --> 02:17:56.171]  We don't like this.
[02:17:56.231 --> 02:17:56.952]  Hold on, Ms.
[02:17:56.992 --> 02:17:57.252]  Wheeler.
[02:17:57.332 --> 02:17:59.494]  Let's come back and get back into this.
[02:17:59.514 --> 02:18:00.374]  We're interrupted by a break.
[02:18:00.754 --> 02:18:02.656]  Let's explain this because the statistics show it.
[02:18:03.036 --> 02:18:07.179]  And then even the millennials are anti-abortion now on average.
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:09.480]  It's incredible.
[02:18:09.841 --> 02:18:12.483]  There's a big shift happening and the deep state's panicking.
[02:18:12.503 --> 02:18:12.923]  Stay with us.
[02:18:14.312 --> 02:18:26.039]  Whether it's the World Economic Forum, whether it's the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, whether it's Open Philanthropy and Dustin Moskowitz, we know that all of these organizations thought that they could bamboozle all of us.
[02:18:26.460 --> 02:18:31.203]  They thought that by putting fact checkers on every post, we'd stop sharing posts.
[02:18:31.663 --> 02:18:35.586]  They thought by canceling people, that we wouldn't actually listen to people's voices.
[02:18:35.686 --> 02:18:37.267]  But the bad news is for them,
[02:18:38.027 --> 02:18:39.147]  We continue to do it.
[02:18:39.528 --> 02:18:41.348]  So what are the simple things that you can do?
[02:18:41.708 --> 02:18:47.751]  The simple things you can do, like I said before, support the alternative platforms that are allowing these voices to be heard.
[02:18:48.051 --> 02:18:50.531]  Make sure that you actually have these conversations.
[02:18:50.692 --> 02:18:55.533]  Without the utility of this voice and this platform, we will lose the war.
[02:18:55.953 --> 02:18:57.334]  So our job is really simple.
[02:18:57.774 --> 02:18:59.675]  So, I don't get a lot of hate.
[02:18:59.955 --> 02:19:15.622]  When Trump first got elected, I got maybe, you know, 10% hate, 90% love, but now it's like a month might go by before I get attacked or somebody yells at me, but I was going to pick up my seven-year-old daughter from camp.
[02:19:27.262 --> 02:19:32.607]  Sunday with my wife, and we pulled into a little Italian restaurant in Austin before we drove out of the hill country to get her.
[02:19:33.427 --> 02:19:37.731]  And this woman, probably 60 years old, came and sat down next to us.
[02:19:37.771 --> 02:19:38.832]  Her husband hadn't come in yet.
[02:19:39.032 --> 02:19:40.734]  And she sat down and looked at me like she wanted to kill me.
[02:19:40.754 --> 02:19:44.277]  She starts shaking her head, heavy breathing, staring at me.
[02:19:44.617 --> 02:19:45.658]  And then her husband comes over.
[02:19:45.698 --> 02:19:46.198]  They sit down.
[02:19:46.238 --> 02:19:47.640]  She says, I don't know if I can eat with him here.
[02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:50.701]  And like, literally, this woman thinks I'm the devil.
[02:19:50.801 --> 02:19:54.182]  I didn't lie about WMDs, I didn't open the borders up, I didn't ship in fentanyl or anything.
[02:19:55.003 --> 02:19:58.464]  But to her, she's an old white woman, she thinks I'm Satan incarnate.
[02:20:00.285 --> 02:20:08.468]  And so, since we've got popular talk show host Liz Wheeler here, who's, you know, on this beat, and is a woman and a mother, I want to get her take on it, because these studies come out all the time.
[02:20:09.088 --> 02:20:15.811]  Leptis, nine times more likely to steal, seven times more likely to lie about you, to file fake reports.
[02:20:15.831 --> 02:20:17.872]  You know, the studies are in Europe, they're in Canada, they're here.
[02:20:19.090 --> 02:20:19.950]  Basically the same numbers.
[02:20:20.491 --> 02:20:24.073]  Seven to ten times more likely to claim they're giving to charity than they're not.
[02:20:25.233 --> 02:20:26.534]  I mean, leftists are losers.
[02:20:26.974 --> 02:20:30.216]  And they bought into the system, and it's not working for them, so they're pissed.
[02:20:30.236 --> 02:20:31.357]  So look at this new study.
[02:20:33.398 --> 02:20:34.699]  It's a big Gallup study.
[02:20:35.839 --> 02:20:36.700]  Top polling agency.
[02:20:37.901 --> 02:20:41.763]  Over 50% of liberal white women under 30 have a mental health issue.
[02:20:42.583 --> 02:20:43.524]  Are we worried yet?
[02:20:44.744 --> 02:20:47.046]  They want to be a victim, so they opt in.
[02:20:49.261 --> 02:20:57.046]  Something like 30% of them are on drugs, prescription psychotropics, antipsychotics, antidepressants.
[02:20:57.807 --> 02:21:00.789]  Over 30% of liberal white women under 30 have a mental health issue.
[02:21:01.329 --> 02:21:03.210]  Well, that's because they're not happy.
[02:21:04.591 --> 02:21:07.293]  Here's the family studies from Gallup.
[02:21:08.534 --> 02:21:11.176]  Parenting is the key to adolescent mental health.
[02:21:12.381 --> 02:21:18.602]  And it's a huge report on this and it gets into all that, the other reports here on women.
[02:21:19.743 --> 02:21:25.284]  Has a doctor or other health care provider ever told you that you have a mental health condition?
[02:21:25.304 --> 02:21:25.284]  50%.
[02:21:26.304 --> 02:21:27.224]  56% actually.
[02:21:28.345 --> 02:21:33.986]  So, what is going on with women and you know they say the definition of mental illness
[02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:38.642]  He's doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result.
[02:21:38.662 --> 02:21:39.943]  Here's another one off the same study.
[02:21:40.363 --> 02:21:40.643]  U.S.
[02:21:40.743 --> 02:21:43.665]  women have become more liberal, men mostly stable.
[02:21:44.606 --> 02:21:47.547]  So they're Stockholm'd by the lockdowns and the mask.
[02:21:47.627 --> 02:21:59.295]  And because, quite frankly, women on average, some women are, you know, like Joan of Arc or, you know, there's so many examples, are leaders and want to be leaders.
[02:21:59.315 --> 02:21:59.835]  That's great.
[02:21:59.855 --> 02:22:02.737]  We put the women leaders on the air, but most women don't seek that.
[02:22:02.757 --> 02:22:04.438]  They're trying to find people for community.
[02:22:05.776 --> 02:22:06.797]  They're not Margaret Thatcher.
[02:22:07.317 --> 02:22:07.998]  Most men aren't.
[02:22:08.758 --> 02:22:12.762]  And then they get sucked into a thing that's designed with psychological warfare to abuse them.
[02:22:13.142 --> 02:22:14.563]  Liz Wheeler, do you agree with that?
[02:22:14.683 --> 02:22:20.788]  And if so, how do we get women, who on average are obviously, 80% of advertising targets women.
[02:22:21.049 --> 02:22:21.609]  Because they know.
[02:22:21.669 --> 02:22:22.210]  Hitler said.
[02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:25.090]  First you get the women, then you got the children, so follow the men.
[02:22:25.551 --> 02:22:26.131]  Advertising.
[02:22:26.151 --> 02:22:27.111]  You go take basic advertising.
[02:22:27.131 --> 02:22:32.012]  I only took it like at community college, then quick, because, you know, I was already successful in business when I was like 19.
[02:22:32.752 --> 02:22:34.132]  It was all about targeting women.
[02:22:34.192 --> 02:22:34.432]  Women.
[02:22:34.472 --> 02:22:34.692]  Women.
[02:22:34.712 --> 02:22:35.953]  80% of advertising targeting women.
[02:22:36.293 --> 02:22:44.895]  How do you get women to realize they're targeted, and maybe these big corporations and BlackRock and CNN and MTV and Netflix aren't their friends.
[02:22:44.935 --> 02:22:48.595]  I mean, can't they get, like, they've been doing something that's not making them happy.
[02:22:49.156 --> 02:22:50.156]  Maybe there's something else.
[02:22:50.196 --> 02:22:51.156]  Can you speak to this?
[02:22:52.409 --> 02:22:59.711]  Yeah, I saw those same headlines this morning, and I actually did laugh at one of the headlines when it says, men mostly stable, but women with mental health issues.
[02:23:00.111 --> 02:23:01.511]  It's just a funny headline.
[02:23:02.052 --> 02:23:06.373]  I do think that women are the victim of psychological manipulation.
[02:23:06.413 --> 02:23:08.973]  This is not to say that there are not real mental health issues.
[02:23:09.293 --> 02:23:11.234]  Depression and anxiety are real in many cases.
[02:23:11.494 --> 02:23:14.635]  Personality disorders, schizophrenia are real, especially after you smoke marijuana.
[02:23:15.555 --> 02:23:32.015]  But I think oftentimes women are told by our culture, by influencers online, by talk show hosts, by schools, by universities, that every problem or period of adversity in their life gives them some kind of trauma that
[02:23:32.455 --> 02:23:34.056]  It should be a diagnosis.
[02:23:34.256 --> 02:23:39.118]  And then once they're given this diagnosis, they are basically taught to be narcissists.
[02:23:39.178 --> 02:23:50.062]  They are taught that everything is about them, and anything that they don't like, anything that they don't agree with, anything that bothers them, anything difficult, is toxic, and that they should cut it out.
[02:23:50.582 --> 02:23:55.044]  And the reason that the left engages in this mass kind of manipulation— And that's how you feed—sorry, sorry, you're dead on.
[02:23:55.284 --> 02:23:57.985]  That's how you feed delusion is not facing problems.
[02:23:58.305 --> 02:23:59.586]  Well, it's isolating to them.
[02:24:00.166 --> 02:24:13.254]  It isolates them so that they fall prey to these narratives that, the feminist narratives that we were talking about before, that you need to pursue a career instead of making a home, that you should kill your child to be empowered, that to be liberated is to be sexually promiscuous.
[02:24:13.314 --> 02:24:16.276]  Even though we all know, studies show that these things are harmful for women,
[02:24:16.676 --> 02:24:19.118]  They lead to, I mean, suicidality.
[02:24:19.498 --> 02:24:22.580]  It increases in women when they abort their children.
[02:24:22.921 --> 02:24:25.663]  We know that career breeds depression and anxiety in women.
[02:24:25.683 --> 02:24:33.529]  If you want to talk about these mental health issues, it's begot of, the real ones are begot of this cultural indoctrination that they face.
[02:24:33.869 --> 02:24:41.715]  And the not so real ones are just a way of isolating any kind of dissenting voices around women that might say, hey, listen, if you're not happy, don't buy into the liberal narrative.
[02:24:41.875 --> 02:24:43.636]  Go ahead and be who God created you to be.
[02:24:44.137 --> 02:24:45.898]  And it's been going on for generations.
[02:24:46.118 --> 02:24:55.801]  I don't know the answer to how we save women who have been fully indoctrinated, but I do know that we have a lot of options for how to prevent the next generation of women from falling prey to this.
[02:24:55.821 --> 02:24:55.961]  I agree.
[02:24:55.981 --> 02:24:57.741]  I mean, we've seen the parents' rights movements.
[02:24:58.081 --> 02:25:00.902]  Homeschool your children, raise them, don't let them be on TikTok.
[02:25:01.142 --> 02:25:07.044]  These are real avenues that parents should take very seriously to protect your young daughter from becoming one of these women.
[02:25:07.904 --> 02:25:10.825]  Well, let me just tell you my experience as a man growing up in Texas.
[02:25:11.872 --> 02:25:12.592]  We're good to go.
[02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:48.008]  And then I saw the women as happy as with their children and their life and their friends over and everything they were doing and I'm not saying men against women I'm just saying men go and die in war and we run the nuclear reactors and they go down in the manholes and they I mean it's like
[02:25:48.248 --> 02:25:49.729]  It's like what our biology does.
[02:25:49.769 --> 02:25:53.972]  We want to serve women, and now men are in shambles, not wanting women.
[02:25:53.993 --> 02:25:54.573]  Look at Japan.
[02:25:54.593 --> 02:25:56.795]  Other places are great examples, but they're extreme examples.
[02:25:57.155 --> 02:26:02.299]  Men are falling away now and staying like Peter Pan adolescence and saying, I'm done.
[02:26:02.399 --> 02:26:04.100]  So men have a crisis too.
[02:26:04.521 --> 02:26:06.622]  They're just not so much playing into the victim.
[02:26:06.862 --> 02:26:07.683]  They're just rotting.
[02:26:07.983 --> 02:26:12.487]  So this is a real spiritual, biological weapon that's been detonated against us.
[02:26:13.655 --> 02:26:15.696]  It is, and I wouldn't underestimate the war on men.
[02:26:16.116 --> 02:26:16.977]  It's extremely serious.
[02:26:17.017 --> 02:26:19.678]  It's just the way that you target women is different than the way that you target men.
[02:26:20.019 --> 02:26:21.619]  Men are told that they are inherently evil.
[02:26:21.659 --> 02:26:26.442]  They're told that they're essentially born to be rapists unless it's trained out of them.
[02:26:26.462 --> 02:26:31.065]  They're told that their desire to protect and provide and procreate is somehow toxic.
[02:26:31.405 --> 02:26:34.527]  It's somehow patriarchal in the feminist way that they use that term.
[02:26:34.907 --> 02:26:38.909]  And this has caused an incredible crisis among men in our nation.
[02:26:39.169 --> 02:26:42.291]  I mean, most of our social institutions are
[02:26:42.671 --> 02:26:43.071]  I don't
[02:27:02.998 --> 02:27:06.362]  Good, right, and proper aspects of masculinity are under assault.
[02:27:06.382 --> 02:27:15.592]  I mean, if you're a man on a college campus right now, and you face a false accusation from some chick who didn't like the way that you looked at her, you basically are denied due process of law.
[02:27:15.812 --> 02:27:18.195]  Alex, I've said this before on my show, and I'll say it again.
[02:27:18.215 --> 02:27:19.717]  I am frightened
[02:27:20.177 --> 02:27:26.562]  For the men in my life, the men that I know, the men who watch this show, because it is a landmine out there.
[02:27:26.602 --> 02:27:29.404]  It is a field of landmines.
[02:27:29.684 --> 02:27:46.316]  You so much as walk by a woman who is having a bad day, she says something negatively about you, you could be canceled, you could be fired, you could be publicly humiliated, your life could be absolutely ruined, or you could be prosecuted, not even in a court of law, but on a college campus with the same sort of criminal repercussions.
[02:27:47.517 --> 02:27:47.857]  No, I agree.
[02:27:47.897 --> 02:27:49.697]  Yes, femininity is under attack and it's awful.
[02:27:49.898 --> 02:27:51.518]  Masculinity is also under attack.
[02:27:51.838 --> 02:27:54.599]  And yet it's just politically incorrect to stand up for those men.
[02:27:55.039 --> 02:27:55.499]  That's right.
[02:27:55.519 --> 02:27:56.979]  And men shouldn't play into the victim thing.
[02:27:56.999 --> 02:27:58.479]  We should just stand up in our own biology.
[02:27:58.860 --> 02:28:00.460]  But we're one species together.
[02:28:00.500 --> 02:28:01.220]  So let me raise this.
[02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:08.282]  I'm not an ornithologist and I'm not a, you know, like a Desmond Morris animal behaviorist, but I've read a lot of the books and studied it.
[02:28:08.382 --> 02:28:09.082]  It's fascinating.
[02:28:10.256 --> 02:28:11.797]  So I've read hundreds of books on the subject.
[02:28:12.238 --> 02:28:25.349]  In almost every species, particularly birds, the female has to sit there on a nest, and she has to sit there for like a month or longer, so the species doesn't exist if the male doesn't bring her food.
[02:28:25.750 --> 02:28:37.220]  It's not that she's his slave, it's that he biologically is designed, and in the courtship, say, of cardinals, he shows the female how much food he can bring her, and she says, yes, you're good, you're gonna bring me food,
[02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:41.022]  I can now sit here, have these eggs, have our babies and continue the species.
[02:28:41.342 --> 02:28:43.043]  It isn't like some cultural thing.
[02:28:43.383 --> 02:28:44.744]  It is what we do.
[02:28:44.764 --> 02:28:52.668]  So that's why men bring women chocolates or flowers and so many other species, not just mammals, but birds and others.
[02:28:53.008 --> 02:28:58.971]  The males bring gifts to the females because the female has to then, which is a great honor, obviously, she loves it.
[02:28:59.391 --> 02:29:02.673]  She has to produce the energy to produce the babies.
[02:29:02.733 --> 02:29:04.194]  She has to sit in one spot.
[02:29:04.694 --> 02:29:07.418]  So you look at that at the bird level, you accelerate it up to us.
[02:29:07.478 --> 02:29:09.361]  They're attacking our basic biology.
[02:29:10.831 --> 02:29:12.912]  That's pretty much how I feel when I'm pregnant.
[02:29:13.472 --> 02:29:21.594]  I pretty much feel like I'm sitting in the nest and that I would perish and so would the rest of humanity if my husband doesn't bring me food.
[02:29:21.634 --> 02:29:23.975]  So I think that's an accurate analogy here.
[02:29:24.015 --> 02:29:33.277]  But again, I mean, we can talk about all these different examples of the way that family and men and women and children are attacked, but it all comes down to why.
[02:29:33.297 --> 02:29:34.758]  Why are they being attacked?
[02:29:34.778 --> 02:29:38.679]  They're being attacked because the ideology of Marxism, which is a satanic ideology,
[02:29:39.339 --> 02:29:39.459]  Yes.
[02:29:39.700 --> 02:29:39.760]  Yes.
[02:29:39.780 --> 02:29:39.880]  Yes.
[02:30:03.377 --> 02:30:07.301]  Again, I know this goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning, but this is one of the reasons I was so excited when J.D.
[02:30:07.341 --> 02:30:12.706]  Vance was announced as Trump's vice-presidential running mate, because I think he understands what we're talking about today.
[02:30:12.746 --> 02:30:17.151]  He's not just taking a right-wing position because he decided to be part of the Republican Party.
[02:30:17.371 --> 02:30:18.712]  He understands what it means.
[02:30:19.573 --> 02:30:20.093]  Well, absolutely.
[02:30:20.113 --> 02:30:24.778]  I want to get back into your point of Trump needs to move to the right or towards humanity even more.
[02:30:24.858 --> 02:30:25.539]  That is the answer.
[02:30:25.559 --> 02:30:26.199]  That's what we want.
[02:30:28.237 --> 02:30:34.481]  Across the animal kingdom, you have teams, and the male and the female work together, and it's different species.
[02:30:34.521 --> 02:30:39.024]  But generally, it's not like the male is a slave or the female is a slave.
[02:30:39.425 --> 02:30:40.845]  This is what we are.
[02:30:41.586 --> 02:30:42.687]  It's not even a discussion.
[02:30:43.287 --> 02:30:50.872]  And when anybody attacks that, like a male eagle or a falcon bringing food to his mate, they love each other.
[02:30:50.892 --> 02:30:51.733]  They mate for life.
[02:30:51.773 --> 02:30:52.693]  They've got babies.
[02:30:53.094 --> 02:30:53.954]  And that's a team.
[02:30:54.014 --> 02:30:54.815]  That's not sick.
[02:30:54.855 --> 02:30:55.775]  That's not slavery.
[02:30:56.036 --> 02:30:57.397]  That's how they were born.
[02:30:57.437 --> 02:30:58.077]  That's how they live.
[02:30:58.097 --> 02:30:58.261]  We have!
[02:31:00.100 --> 02:31:01.781]  Yeah, it's complementary roles.
[02:31:02.321 --> 02:31:05.802]  It's complementary roles, it's how we were made, and it's also how men and women are the happiest.
[02:31:06.202 --> 02:31:18.966]  You know, I guess, building on the studies that you showed about mental health earlier, if you want to talk about when men are the happiest, healthiest, have the longest life, have the least likelihood of getting cancer or having a heart attack or committing suicide, well, it's married men.
[02:31:19.006 --> 02:31:21.406]  Men who are serving their role as husband and father.
[02:31:21.727 --> 02:31:22.387]  The same with women.
[02:31:22.447 --> 02:31:29.689]  Women who are the most fulfilled, who are the happiest being women, who have the least mental health issues, who smile the most, and...
[02:31:30.009 --> 02:31:32.671]  You are following your biology.
[02:31:32.771 --> 02:31:34.552]  You're following what you're supposed to do.
[02:31:36.013 --> 02:31:37.033]  Yes, that's exactly right.
[02:31:37.914 --> 02:31:41.436]  And then these leftist women with purple hair or whatever, they're trying to reject your humanity.
[02:31:41.456 --> 02:31:44.738]  We don't hate you, and we're not mad that some of you couldn't get a man.
[02:31:44.898 --> 02:31:46.919]  We're not judging single moms, any of that.
[02:31:47.219 --> 02:31:51.822]  We're just saying there's a way to go here, and we're just simply promoting what works.
[02:31:53.709 --> 02:31:54.150]  That's right.
[02:31:54.170 --> 02:32:00.318]  I mean, that's why I think the video that you showed earlier of Molly Jong Fast on, I think it was MSNBC, I see videos like that.
[02:32:00.338 --> 02:32:04.363]  And if you look at the comments underneath, there are a lot of people that are like, haha, who would want to marry you?
[02:32:04.463 --> 02:32:06.126]  Or good thing you're not bringing children into the world.
[02:32:06.526 --> 02:32:08.469]  And well, I have a
[02:32:08.669 --> 02:32:09.790]  A different reaction to that.
[02:32:09.890 --> 02:32:10.931]  I told you, I'm pretty based.
[02:32:10.951 --> 02:32:12.193]  I'm pretty savage about politics.
[02:32:12.233 --> 02:32:20.341]  I think that she's promoting something that is anti-humanity when she calls having children natalism, like it's some kind of twisted ideology to want to have a baby with your husband.
[02:32:20.361 --> 02:32:21.122]  That's weird.
[02:32:21.142 --> 02:32:22.904]  And not like they're calling J.D.
[02:32:22.964 --> 02:32:23.544]  Vance weird.
[02:32:23.725 --> 02:32:26.788]  But I actually feel sorry for her because her existence on Earth is going to be what?
[02:32:27.268 --> 02:32:28.469]  Going on MSNBC?
[02:32:28.809 --> 02:32:30.350]  What about, what about eternity?
[02:32:30.390 --> 02:32:32.151]  What about the things that actually matter?
[02:32:32.191 --> 02:32:34.172]  And going on TV is not the things that actually matter.
[02:32:34.192 --> 02:32:39.955]  We go on TV, you and I Alex, to fight for the things that actually matter so that we get a chance to enjoy them.
[02:32:40.195 --> 02:32:47.379]  So I actually feel, I feel compassion for women like that because I think they're really missing, they're missing their experience of humanity.
[02:32:48.342 --> 02:32:55.749]  Well, I've got four children, and I've been around a lot of women with children, and women, you know, she's got children, they're high as a kite with their children.
[02:32:56.110 --> 02:33:00.654]  And women sitting around, cooking food, the house, all together, you look at them, they're like in bliss.
[02:33:01.615 --> 02:33:05.339]  And it's like trying to say that's evil is sick.
[02:33:07.822 --> 02:33:08.142]  It is.
[02:33:08.202 --> 02:33:09.344]  And by the way, I love your viewers.
[02:33:09.504 --> 02:33:13.788]  I'm watching the comments in the live stream as we talk, and somebody was like, well, who has your children while you're working?
[02:33:14.128 --> 02:33:17.231]  Actually, this is, and I talk about this quite often, and I want to share this.
[02:33:17.632 --> 02:33:20.414]  I identify as a stay-at-home mom who does this on the side.
[02:33:20.534 --> 02:33:22.637]  I don't work in an office nine to five.
[02:33:22.677 --> 02:33:23.477]  My kids are in the other room.
[02:33:23.517 --> 02:33:24.779]  My husband's watching them while they nap.
[02:33:25.779 --> 02:33:31.524]  So that I can talk to you, Alex, because we have a properly ordered house, and that is the way that we're the happiest.
[02:33:31.624 --> 02:33:32.985]  Our marriage is properly ordered.
[02:33:33.305 --> 02:33:38.269]  We are delighted and happy to have two wonderful daughters.
[02:33:38.489 --> 02:33:42.812]  And I do advocate—I'm not just saying that because it's something that we've discovered.
[02:33:42.872 --> 02:33:43.613]  That's good for me.
[02:33:43.633 --> 02:33:48.056]  This is who God created us to be, all of us, bar none.
[02:33:48.376 --> 02:33:54.020]  This idea, and this gets philosophical for a second, but natural law is not something that just I believe because I happen to be Christian.
[02:33:54.060 --> 02:33:55.762]  Natural law is something that governs all of us.
[02:33:55.862 --> 02:34:02.246]  And natural law says men and women belong together to create babies, to have families, and it's the ball work of a free society.
[02:34:02.587 --> 02:34:03.007]  Period.
[02:34:03.087 --> 02:34:04.208]  Well, Liz, let me expand on that.
[02:34:04.248 --> 02:34:05.669]  That's why we want politicians to advocate for this.
[02:34:06.209 --> 02:34:06.570]  Absolutely.
[02:34:07.472 --> 02:34:13.577]  You've got the Muslims at the other extreme make their wives wear beekeeper suits and won't let them leave the house.
[02:34:13.677 --> 02:34:14.998]  That's not Western culture.
[02:34:15.078 --> 02:34:16.119]  That's not Christianity.
[02:34:16.519 --> 02:34:17.160]  Let's be clear.
[02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:20.603]  My grandfather was in county government, helped people.
[02:34:20.643 --> 02:34:24.866]  He also was a foreman on building highways and everything else.
[02:34:25.426 --> 02:34:31.671]  And when he was 200 miles away building a highway and they had the apples come in or they had the corn come in,
[02:34:32.785 --> 02:34:38.328]  My grandmother took my uncle and my dad out and she would, with the farm hands, direct them and then cook them lunch.
[02:34:38.769 --> 02:34:46.433]  It doesn't mean that because a woman is home taking care of the kids that she isn't writing the checks, that she isn't making the decisions on major issues.
[02:34:46.453 --> 02:34:47.114]  They're unified.
[02:34:47.314 --> 02:34:50.156]  There wasn't my grandmother and my grandfather fighting.
[02:34:50.196 --> 02:34:51.176]  They were one team.
[02:34:51.216 --> 02:34:52.257]  It was beautiful to watch.
[02:34:52.517 --> 02:34:52.877]  I think so.
[02:35:13.655 --> 02:35:14.255]  We're good to go.
[02:35:42.129 --> 02:35:48.333]  But the idea that, oh, then once a woman says she's conservative, she's a homemaker, well now she can't drive a car.
[02:35:48.574 --> 02:35:50.014]  That's not what conservatives say.
[02:35:50.075 --> 02:35:50.675]  It's the opposite.
[02:35:50.755 --> 02:35:52.276]  Our women know how to shoot guns.
[02:35:52.556 --> 02:35:54.658]  They know how to do jujitsu.
[02:35:55.478 --> 02:36:07.106]  All the conservative women I know are better looking, smarter, tougher, totally independent, compared to what you, feminists are these basket cases, freaking out, scared of their own shadows.
[02:36:08.939 --> 02:36:09.899]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[02:36:09.919 --> 02:36:21.624]  I mean, sometimes I think conservatives fall prey to the battle of the sexes that the left tries to instill, where they try to make it seem like men and women are always fighting, that they're always competing, that they're trying to outdo each other.
[02:36:21.944 --> 02:36:23.725]  That's not been my experience in my marriage.
[02:36:23.765 --> 02:36:24.705]  We are complementary.
[02:36:24.765 --> 02:36:25.406]  We are one.
[02:36:26.066 --> 02:36:31.488]  And we work together for the same goals, to provide and love for our family, to make each other whole.
[02:36:31.528 --> 02:36:32.448]  And how empowering is that?
[02:36:32.488 --> 02:36:32.808]  Exactly.
[02:36:32.849 --> 02:36:33.589]  It's one unit.
[02:36:33.969 --> 02:36:36.310]  Once you get that sync, how amazing is that?
[02:36:37.358 --> 02:36:37.999]  It's amazing.
[02:36:38.039 --> 02:36:41.884]  We're about to have our seven-year wedding anniversary, and it's been the best seven years of my life.
[02:36:41.944 --> 02:36:44.707]  I couldn't speak more highly of marriage or of my husband.
[02:36:44.828 --> 02:36:48.492]  I absolutely adore him and respect him, and I'm so happy being married to him.
[02:36:48.853 --> 02:36:52.557]  But this is also, I think, why when we're talking about
[02:36:53.118 --> 02:37:06.652]  Human nature or reality, which is what you and I are discussing right now and how it applies to politics, we need to be able to say conservatives, Republicans, even the Trump campaign needs to be able to look at Kamala Harris and not allow the left to define what a quote-unquote women's issue is.
[02:37:06.672 --> 02:37:07.213]  Don't define.
[02:37:07.253 --> 02:37:08.834]  They shouldn't have the moral high ground.
[02:37:08.874 --> 02:37:10.196]  Say, you don't do the definitions.
[02:37:10.216 --> 02:37:10.937]  Of course not.
[02:37:10.957 --> 02:37:11.077]  Yeah.
[02:37:11.570 --> 02:37:17.053]  No, no, they shouldn't say, oh, a woman, you're a woman, so you must be most interested in birth control.
[02:37:17.073 --> 02:37:20.455]  You must be most interested in your ability to access an abortion.
[02:37:20.615 --> 02:37:23.557]  No, they should look at Kamala Harris and be like, Kamala Harris is dangerous for women.
[02:37:23.837 --> 02:37:35.724]  With this open border, these illegal aliens, these criminals, cartel members, MS-13, terrorists are coming in, and they are wreaking havoc on our cities, on our neighborhoods, on the homes that we are trying to create for our families.
[02:37:35.744 --> 02:37:40.867]  I did an episode of my show on Monday where I talked about some of the previously
[02:37:41.067 --> 02:37:44.568]  Oh my god, there were like a hundred knife attacks the last three days in Europe.
[02:37:44.588 --> 02:37:46.108]  In one, they stabbed three little girls to death.
[02:37:46.128 --> 02:37:47.048]  There's riots in England.
[02:37:47.068 --> 02:37:47.868]  I mean, it is so screwed up.
[02:38:11.047 --> 02:38:15.810]  It is, but we should be able to look at Kamala Harris and be like, stop talking about abortion and talk about the women.
[02:38:16.090 --> 02:38:23.756]  Say the names of the women who were murdered by the criminal aliens that you allowed back in the country because you encouraged them to come here and you refused to secure the border.
[02:38:23.796 --> 02:38:31.981]  I promise you, that will resonate with women because no one wants to live in a country, in a city, in a neighborhood where we fear that happening to ourselves or our daughters.
[02:38:32.141 --> 02:38:32.682]  No, I agree.
[02:38:32.742 --> 02:38:39.707]  So, and not all the Islamics, but the main orthodox Islam, everybody knows women are powerful, the center of everything.
[02:38:40.527 --> 02:38:44.948]  And so you have Islam enslaves women to control them because of the power of them.
[02:38:45.468 --> 02:38:48.249]  You have the left that wants to enslave them under the state, under their system.
[02:38:48.809 --> 02:38:54.510]  But Christianity in the West is actually in the middle, which is freedom and empowerment of the family and empowerment of everybody.
[02:38:55.090 --> 02:38:58.511]  And so we can't be on one end of the spectrum or the other.
[02:38:58.551 --> 02:39:02.732]  We have to actually go with the reality and promote that.
[02:39:04.659 --> 02:39:21.348]  We do, and what's interesting, and this is going back to my conversion story away from libertarianism, is I used to think that our country was set up along the principles of John Locke, or sort of like the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, that it was individual liberty, that we acknowledged a creator, but then we just stuck to
[02:39:22.048 --> 02:39:31.436]  Keeping as much liberty as possible to prevent anarchy only, but giving individual people the power to do whatever they wanted, whatever they chose, whatever their conscience dictated, or not.
[02:39:31.736 --> 02:39:33.658]  Basically, license, not liberty.
[02:39:34.098 --> 02:39:36.980]  And I realize that actually our country was never set up that way.
[02:39:37.020 --> 02:39:49.871]  The Declaration of Independence was written with that kind of philosophical or ideological bent, but actually we were created as a nation towards ordered liberty, which is not only acknowledging a creator, but acknowledging a moral order.
[02:39:50.151 --> 02:40:09.685]  And our founding fathers were extremely clear that if we did not order our society towards the greater good, and not just this vague idea of the greater good, this vague idea of human rights that, you know, leftists give us, but actually ordered towards good and truth and beauty as defined by God, defined by the Christian religion, then our society would fall.
[02:40:09.725 --> 02:40:18.131]  We would not be a free country because you cannot have a libertarian nation that exists, that continues to exist.
[02:40:18.151 --> 02:40:18.952]  What happens is it
[02:40:19.392 --> 02:40:20.093]  I don't think so.
[02:40:33.797 --> 02:40:34.237]  Well, that's right.
[02:40:34.257 --> 02:40:36.158]  The left claims the right wing's banning books.
[02:40:36.238 --> 02:40:38.660]  No, we're banning giving five-year-olds pedophile books.
[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:39.720]  We're not banning the book.
[02:40:39.740 --> 02:40:40.521]  That's right.
[02:40:40.601 --> 02:40:42.102]  We're not banning Hustler.
[02:40:42.142 --> 02:40:43.362]  We're just not giving it to a three-year-old.
[02:40:44.563 --> 02:40:45.384]  And so that's what's happening.
[02:40:45.404 --> 02:40:46.224]  Well, amazing.
[02:40:46.904 --> 02:40:48.385]  In closing, we have 60 seconds left.
[02:40:48.405 --> 02:40:54.088]  Liz Wheeler, everybody should find your work at Liz underscore Wheeler on X and LizWheeler.com with your popular talk show.
[02:40:54.749 --> 02:40:56.210]  Trump, the timid assassination.
[02:40:56.250 --> 02:41:00.132]  What's your prediction real fast going into this unprecedented time?
[02:41:01.397 --> 02:41:02.657]  Yeah, thanks so much for having me, Alex.
[02:41:02.677 --> 02:41:03.417]  I really appreciate it.
[02:41:03.437 --> 02:41:08.979]  You guys can subscribe on YouTube at youtube.com slash Liz Wheeler 2 to watch my show, and I'd love to see you all there.
[02:41:09.299 --> 02:41:12.800]  Listen, the Trump assassination attempt is one of the shadiest things that we've seen.
[02:41:13.180 --> 02:41:17.701]  I don't want to live in a country where I believe that this is an inside job.
[02:41:17.761 --> 02:41:24.462]  I don't want to live in a country where I believe that a government agency tried to kill a former president and presidential candidate.
[02:41:24.522 --> 02:41:27.023]  But all of the red flags, if we follow the evidence,
[02:41:27.583 --> 02:41:31.585]  All of these red flags really do beget the question, what happened here?
[02:41:31.985 --> 02:41:35.927]  Can this really be explained by just government incompetence?
[02:41:36.267 --> 02:41:39.289]  I mean, sure, government is incompetent, but really to this level?
[02:41:39.309 --> 02:41:41.950]  I don't know if you saw that video that was recently released.
[02:41:41.990 --> 02:41:43.971]  They had a shot of Trump.
[02:41:44.531 --> 02:41:48.293]  And beyond Trump, in the background, you can see the shooter walking along the roof.
[02:41:48.313 --> 02:41:50.374]  There is no way Secret Service did not see that.
[02:41:50.874 --> 02:41:51.835]  No way whatsoever.
[02:41:51.855 --> 02:41:52.335]  90 minutes!
[02:41:52.395 --> 02:41:53.235]  They were protecting him.
[02:41:53.275 --> 02:41:53.896]  They were ordered to.
[02:41:53.936 --> 02:41:54.396]  They're caught.
[02:41:55.580 --> 02:42:01.722]  Yeah, and I think if they believe it's politically expedient, and that's key, then it's going to happen again.
[02:42:02.922 --> 02:42:03.282]  Of course.
[02:42:03.302 --> 02:42:04.042]  Oh, look at that.
[02:42:04.222 --> 02:42:04.703]  Look at that.
[02:42:06.163 --> 02:42:07.103]  And everybody's pointing.
[02:42:07.123 --> 02:42:07.663]  He's there!
[02:42:07.683 --> 02:42:08.143]  He's there!
[02:42:08.163 --> 02:42:10.804]  Oh my God, they thought they'd get him.
[02:42:11.244 --> 02:42:12.965]  Well, that just shows God's on our side.
[02:42:13.365 --> 02:42:17.006]  If you were the New World Order, you've got to be crapping Tiffany Cufflinks right now.
[02:42:19.164 --> 02:42:19.844]  Yeah, I would be.
[02:42:19.864 --> 02:42:21.785]  I would be.
[02:42:22.346 --> 02:42:33.492]  I think that Trump seemed, during his RNC acceptance speech, or during the nomination acceptance speech, he seemed really touched by the experience, like he'd been deeply impacted, like he'd maybe met God in a way that he hadn't ever met God before.
[02:42:34.132 --> 02:42:39.555]  And I hope that that's the case, because he was correct when he said it was the hand of Almighty God that protected him.
[02:42:39.815 --> 02:42:40.776]  That is exactly what it
[02:42:40.776 --> 02:42:41.376]  I don't know.
[02:43:03.211 --> 02:43:04.692]  We've seen a lot of people
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:35.843]  And a lot of corporate media and a lot of pundits, and I see a lot, thousands of articles, the last month saying, Infowars will imminently be shut down.
[02:43:37.384 --> 02:43:42.566]  And they panicked with a federally appointed CRO and federally appointed U.S.
[02:43:44.166 --> 02:43:49.268]  trustee from the Justice Department, and five weeks ago, ordered this place shut without a court order.
[02:43:50.543 --> 02:43:54.287]  The judge excoriated them, fired them three weeks ago.
[02:43:54.948 --> 02:44:02.256]  Then two weeks ago, the Democrat Party lawyers that use the Sandy Hook parents as a front group came in and said we want him shut down today.
[02:44:02.657 --> 02:44:03.898]  The judge shut that down.
[02:44:04.479 --> 02:44:08.203]  Then they tried to grab InfoWars a week and a half ago at the state court.
[02:44:08.283 --> 02:44:10.085]  The judge said that's illegal and shut that down.
[02:44:10.345 --> 02:44:10.966]  This is epic.
[02:44:11.426 --> 02:44:12.807]  People say, how is this continuing on?
[02:44:12.867 --> 02:44:13.788]  Because we're fighting.
[02:44:14.348 --> 02:44:15.209]  We're not giving up.
[02:44:15.309 --> 02:44:15.969]  You're praying.
[02:44:16.670 --> 02:44:18.531]  But I love how five weeks ago, I told you this happened.
[02:44:18.551 --> 02:44:20.673]  It's like, oh yeah, they came out in order to shut it down.
[02:44:21.273 --> 02:44:22.394]  You stood up to them and all this.
[02:44:22.414 --> 02:44:23.034]  Where's the video?
[02:44:23.234 --> 02:44:24.816]  You want on top of that video?
[02:44:25.176 --> 02:44:25.876]  Confronting people?
[02:44:26.237 --> 02:44:27.057]  This is serious.
[02:44:27.097 --> 02:44:27.998]  I tried to not escalate.
[02:44:29.079 --> 02:44:30.219]  Now it's all in the court record.
[02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:31.140]  Of course it's true.
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:32.241]  Of course I didn't make this up.
[02:44:32.301 --> 02:44:33.062]  I don't cry wolf.
[02:44:34.082 --> 02:44:34.302]  So...
[02:44:35.731 --> 02:44:40.782]  We are surrounded by wolves, but we've got God on our side and we've got the people that love God supporting us.
[02:44:40.822 --> 02:44:45.933]  So I need all of you to understand that we're still here for at least three months.
[02:44:47.093 --> 02:44:53.156]  But if people think we're not going to be here and don't support them, fullwordstore.com, with great sales and great products, we'll shut down by extension.
[02:44:53.197 --> 02:44:53.817]  That's been happening.
[02:44:54.057 --> 02:44:55.078]  People aren't buying stuff.
[02:44:55.758 --> 02:44:57.659]  Even though we're selling all the products, it's gone away.
[02:44:57.679 --> 02:44:58.740]  Do they think we're about to be shut down?
[02:44:58.800 --> 02:44:58.940]  No.
[02:44:59.320 --> 02:45:00.461]  You order something, you get it.
[02:45:00.821 --> 02:45:08.125]  And so it'll be you that decides to shut us down if you don't go there and get X2 and X3 and Vitamineral Fusion about to sell it and all of it.
[02:45:08.565 --> 02:45:10.927]  But what I want to talk to you about is a fundraiser.
[02:45:11.607 --> 02:45:19.813]  We have a couple thousand copies of the number one worldwide bestseller, The Great Awakening, The Plan to Defeat the Globalists and Launch the Next Great Renaissance.
[02:45:20.393 --> 02:45:21.654]  Huge, thick book I wrote.
[02:45:22.175 --> 02:45:23.576]  Just came out six, eight months ago.
[02:45:24.577 --> 02:45:27.399]  There are a few thousand signed copies left, and it is a fundraiser.
[02:45:27.879 --> 02:45:31.662]  I want to thank those of you that got a signed copy, but I want to encourage all of you
[02:45:33.288 --> 02:45:42.790]  That have not gotten a signed copy and you want a chance to support the broadcast and know that at the critical juncture you fought to get the funds in to keep operating because we're right on the edge of the red and the black.
[02:45:43.910 --> 02:45:50.452]  To go now to infowarestore.com and get The Great Awakening today.
[02:45:50.532 --> 02:45:54.853]  And there's almost 3,000 copies left of this signed, 1,000 copies unsigned.
[02:45:55.773 --> 02:45:59.734]  There's also about 700 copies of The Great Reset, the predecessor book to this.
[02:46:01.901 --> 02:46:05.403]  And unless we get a buyer and things change and, you know, whatever, we'll be shut down in a few months.
[02:46:05.443 --> 02:46:08.044]  But we will probably continue on.
[02:46:08.124 --> 02:46:09.185]  God's hand is on us.
[02:46:09.225 --> 02:46:10.045]  The force is with us.
[02:46:10.906 --> 02:46:12.086]  Please go now.
[02:46:12.366 --> 02:46:20.050]  It's in stock, ready to ship at infowarestore.com and get The Great Awakening, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:23.232]  Defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[02:46:23.352 --> 02:46:26.754]  And when these signed copies are gone here, they're going to be gone.
[02:46:26.814 --> 02:46:29.155]  I'm going to sign this right now.
[02:46:31.854 --> 02:46:37.455]  2024.
[02:46:32.094 --> 02:46:37.455]  And I thank you for everything you do to support us.
[02:46:37.495 --> 02:46:38.896]  And this will be put in the warehouse.
[02:46:39.296 --> 02:46:41.676]  Somebody will get this book.
[02:46:42.216 --> 02:46:43.597]  Put a little something extra on there.
[02:46:45.837 --> 02:46:48.338]  All right, so I appreciate you.
[02:46:48.458 --> 02:46:53.439]  Get The Great Awakening, Defeating the Globalists, and Launching the Next Great Renaissance.
[02:46:54.924 --> 02:47:03.107]  Myself, Alex Jones, Ken Heckenleibig helped put it together with a foreword by Stephen K. Bannon, who's a political prisoner right now in Connecticut in jail.
[02:47:03.907 --> 02:47:05.707]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:47:05.747 --> 02:47:06.708]  We're betting on you.
[02:47:07.048 --> 02:47:08.148]  We believe on you.
[02:47:08.488 --> 02:47:10.329]  But we cannot do this without your support.
[02:47:10.749 --> 02:47:11.349]  Get a copy.
[02:47:11.389 --> 02:47:12.549]  Sign or unsign now.
[02:47:12.869 --> 02:47:15.730]  The last copies at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:47:15.750 --> 02:47:17.891]  And I humbly thank you all for your support.
[02:47:17.951 --> 02:47:19.231]  Now, please take action.
[02:47:23.061 --> 02:47:28.464]  All right, Chase Geyser takes over in T-minus five minutes, and then in one hour, Owen Schroyer takes over the War Room.
[02:47:29.244 --> 02:47:33.086]  The enemy, the globalists, have done a lot to shut this show down.
[02:47:33.906 --> 02:47:34.927]  This isn't Netflix.
[02:47:35.167 --> 02:47:37.948]  It's not... It's not Marvel Comics.
[02:47:38.048 --> 02:47:40.809]  This isn't... This isn't... This isn't Endgame.
[02:47:41.370 --> 02:47:42.410]  It's the Endgame I made.
[02:47:42.430 --> 02:47:47.572]  They admit they based Endgame on the plan to exterminate everybody.
[02:47:47.793 --> 02:47:48.733]  35 million people dead.
[02:47:48.753 --> 02:47:50.474]  I didn't even get to all the COVID news.
[02:47:52.503 --> 02:47:53.083]  We've been hit.
[02:47:53.463 --> 02:47:54.164]  We're in a war.
[02:47:54.844 --> 02:47:55.644]  And we're not victims.
[02:47:55.684 --> 02:47:56.765]  We have to admit we're in a war.
[02:47:57.265 --> 02:48:00.206]  I'm like, oh, I'm a victim of the biological attack of the New World Order.
[02:48:01.487 --> 02:48:02.187]  I'm not a victim.
[02:48:02.207 --> 02:48:02.947]  I'm an overcomer.
[02:48:03.068 --> 02:48:05.068]  But you've got to admit you're under attack.
[02:48:06.689 --> 02:48:13.152]  And so, if we had some benefactor, it would take about $30 million a year to run this operation with all the attacks and things that are going on.
[02:48:13.172 --> 02:48:14.692]  That's nothing with inflation.
[02:48:14.712 --> 02:48:15.653]  Sounds like a big number of people.
[02:48:15.673 --> 02:48:15.993]  It's not.
[02:48:16.953 --> 02:48:18.034]  I would not have one ad on here.
[02:48:19.670 --> 02:48:20.650]  We have our radio stations.
[02:48:20.690 --> 02:48:21.491]  They get their ads.
[02:48:21.771 --> 02:48:22.651]  I've got to pay things.
[02:48:22.811 --> 02:48:23.411]  I've got to do it.
[02:48:24.052 --> 02:48:24.832]  I've got to go through it.
[02:48:24.912 --> 02:48:26.893]  I don't want to sit here and pitch you stuff all day long.
[02:48:27.373 --> 02:48:28.233]  I've got news to cover.
[02:48:30.414 --> 02:48:31.554]  But I've got to sell stuff.
[02:48:31.614 --> 02:48:33.535]  I'm going to sell you stuff you like and stuff you love.
[02:48:33.555 --> 02:48:35.016]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:48:35.036 --> 02:48:39.737]  I want to encourage those of you that sit on the fence while the new world order burns down our planet.
[02:48:41.498 --> 02:48:48.581]  I'm not mad at the 99% of you that ever bought a damn thing at InfoWareStore.com or DrJonesNaturals.com or any of our sponsors, but
[02:48:49.511 --> 02:48:57.596]  You are literally whistling past the graveyard of our civilization because I don't know where we're going to find a show that's had a bigger effect.
[02:48:58.537 --> 02:48:59.698]  I mean, Tucker Carlson, maybe?
[02:49:01.419 --> 02:49:02.720]  I've influenced Joe Rogan heavily.
[02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:04.281]  He's admitted that probably 50 times.
[02:49:04.941 --> 02:49:05.882]  It's not about bragging.
[02:49:05.922 --> 02:49:07.163]  I'm just saying I've delivered.
[02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:09.921]  I've done what I was supposed to do.
[02:49:10.602 --> 02:49:11.262]  I'm exhausted.
[02:49:11.282 --> 02:49:12.623]  I don't have anything to prove.
[02:49:12.683 --> 02:49:15.405]  I don't want to be famous or wear tuxedos or be in D.C.
[02:49:15.506 --> 02:49:16.947]  or hoity-toity around.
[02:49:17.007 --> 02:49:17.868]  I just want to be left alone.
[02:49:18.208 --> 02:49:18.668]  But you know what?
[02:49:18.688 --> 02:49:19.729]  The New World Order didn't leave me alone.
[02:49:20.490 --> 02:49:21.410]  So I'm not leaving them alone.
[02:49:22.912 --> 02:49:32.440]  And I am so thankful on the one hand for all of you that have kept us on air, but I'm also not mad at people, but it's like millions and millions an hour tune in.
[02:49:33.781 --> 02:49:37.163]  And I say 1% because, you know, that sounds like a small percent.
[02:49:37.244 --> 02:49:37.564]  It's like
[02:49:39.068 --> 02:49:39.908]  A tenth of a percent?
[02:49:39.928 --> 02:49:41.969]  I think it's even lower.
[02:49:43.949 --> 02:49:45.610]  Letty called in yesterday, she goes, really?
[02:49:46.230 --> 02:49:47.451]  Less than one percent of her buy-in?
[02:49:47.491 --> 02:49:49.111]  Yeah, I should have been honest.
[02:49:49.151 --> 02:49:51.072]  I think it's like less than one-tenth of a percent.
[02:49:51.912 --> 02:49:52.892]  And I'm not mad at people.
[02:49:52.912 --> 02:49:55.453]  It's like, but like, we've not delivered?
[02:49:56.673 --> 02:49:57.934]  We've not had the enemy adverse?
[02:49:57.954 --> 02:49:59.594]  We've not been right about all this stuff?
[02:49:59.614 --> 02:50:00.534]  We've not game-changed?
[02:50:01.035 --> 02:50:01.915]  Fine, whatever.
[02:50:03.618 --> 02:50:04.840]  I'm not even pissed off about it.
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:09.126]  It's just we're barely hanging on and we have amazing products you need.
[02:50:09.206 --> 02:50:10.608]  Go to mfolwarstore.com.
[02:50:11.749 --> 02:50:13.632]  Go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:50:13.692 --> 02:50:15.835]  Mark those down and just get the great products that are there.
[02:50:17.349 --> 02:50:19.790]  Go get the t-shirt, holdtheline.com.
[02:50:20.530 --> 02:50:22.611]  The Never Surrender shirt, holdtheline.com.
[02:50:23.111 --> 02:50:34.134]  And I thank you for your support, but I just wish there was some magic money tree I could go out to and pick money off of, and then we could just do this show and pay the satellite uplinks, the bandwidth costs, and everything else.
[02:50:35.235 --> 02:50:37.095]  People say, why don't you write a band out video?
[02:50:37.135 --> 02:50:38.556]  It costs hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[02:50:39.380 --> 02:50:40.740]  We could be taking off X any minute.
[02:50:40.940 --> 02:50:43.201]  We didn't build that and have hundreds of contributors to get rid of it.
[02:50:43.961 --> 02:50:46.022]  We're in a war, and I'm not God.
[02:50:46.062 --> 02:50:46.742]  I'm far from it.
[02:50:47.002 --> 02:50:49.563]  So I don't make all the right decisions, but we've been guided by God.
[02:50:49.963 --> 02:50:53.824]  We've made a lot of the right decisions, but we need your word of mouth.
[02:50:54.405 --> 02:51:01.687]  We need your prayer, and we need your financial support at drjonesnaturals.com, infowarestore.com, and all the sponsors.
[02:51:01.747 --> 02:51:02.707]  And they're all amazing.
[02:51:02.987 --> 02:51:08.569]  The best t-shirts, the best films, the best books, the best water filtration, aerial filtration, storable food, best deals.
[02:51:09.289 --> 02:51:09.909]  I could sit here.
[02:51:10.309 --> 02:51:13.471]  I got gold sponsors that are ready to spend two million dollars a month.
[02:51:14.951 --> 02:51:18.133]  Instead, we'll take a few hundred thousand a month from a real sponsor that doesn't gouge you.
[02:51:19.593 --> 02:51:24.435]  No, I could make... My problems could all be solved right now if I just screwed people.
[02:51:24.795 --> 02:51:26.876]  But I don't want to be screwed, so I don't do it.
[02:51:27.476 --> 02:51:29.077]  I understand what comes around goes around.
[02:51:29.537 --> 02:51:31.838]  Plus, I already know that metaphysical rule I learned later in life.
[02:51:32.258 --> 02:51:33.459]  I already treat people like I want to be treated.
[02:51:34.659 --> 02:51:35.920]  So I say our turmeric's the best.
[02:51:36.060 --> 02:51:36.500]  It's the best.
[02:51:37.679 --> 02:51:38.159]  It's there.
[02:51:38.979 --> 02:51:40.060]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:51:40.680 --> 02:51:41.860]  Drjonesnaturals.com.
[02:51:42.420 --> 02:51:44.561]  And I don't want to sit here and belabor this all day.
[02:51:44.941 --> 02:51:47.241]  I'm just telling you, thank you for your support, those that did.
[02:51:47.661 --> 02:51:51.922]  The 500 knives, collectors, breacher, super fancy knife, almost sold out.
[02:51:52.142 --> 02:51:52.583]  That's great.
[02:51:52.603 --> 02:51:54.563]  I want to thank you that got that.
[02:51:55.303 --> 02:52:02.205]  And it just, it's every day, we just continue to try to get the news out, get the viral videos out, battle the globalists.
[02:52:04.704 --> 02:52:16.213]  You asked about the assassination.
[02:52:16.413 --> 02:52:17.514]  My thoughts are as follows.
[02:52:18.515 --> 02:52:22.978]  You know, I think there's going to be a series of black swan events between now and the election.
[02:52:23.038 --> 02:52:25.220]  The day before that happened, someone said, what do you think?
[02:52:25.260 --> 02:52:26.581]  Everyone's always trying to predict the future.
[02:52:26.621 --> 02:52:28.563]  I said, listen, all bets are off.
[02:52:28.703 --> 02:52:29.964]  Something crazy is going to happen.
[02:52:29.984 --> 02:52:30.965]  We don't know what it is.
[02:52:31.625 --> 02:52:39.467]  So I think what's going to happen is more crazy things, black swan events, at least two of them will happen before election day that will throw everything into a state of flux.
[02:52:42.108 --> 02:52:47.849]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:52:48.589 --> 02:52:52.270]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[02:52:53.371 --> 02:52:54.851]  I want you to go back into black swans.
[02:52:54.911 --> 02:52:56.071]  I totally agree with you.
[02:52:56.871 --> 02:52:58.092]  The globalists are in full panic mode.
[02:52:58.112 --> 02:52:59.032]  They failed to kill Trump.
[02:52:59.574 --> 02:53:00.394]  I think the evidence is overwhelming.
[02:53:00.414 --> 02:53:01.175]  There's a stand-down.
[02:53:01.195 --> 02:53:03.255]  I don't know if you guys are doing any investigations into that.
[02:53:03.676 --> 02:53:06.457]  If so, let us know as soon as you're about to break it.
[02:53:06.517 --> 02:53:07.377]  We want to push it hard.
[02:53:07.417 --> 02:53:12.839]  But in the few minutes we have left, go back in and flesh that out, because I really respect your analysis and your sources.
[02:53:13.219 --> 02:53:16.360]  You're saying multiple Black Swan events in the next 90-something days.
[02:53:18.161 --> 02:53:20.582]  Give us some of your ideas and what they may be planning.
[02:53:21.283 --> 02:53:22.004]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:53:22.184 --> 02:53:33.991]  And I appreciate your audience, because we have a lot of sources that come to us at OMG, and we've had Secret Service agents come to us, Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, and all these people are kind of on the precipice of blowing the whistle.
[02:53:34.011 --> 02:53:40.696]  And they're rightfully afraid, because they're going to give up their livelihood, their pension, if they say the thing that they know, but they don't want to say.
[02:53:41.428 --> 02:53:51.351]  So, Black Swan event just means, I forgot the name of the book that was originally quoted as talking about that, but in politics, everyone wants to predict the future.
[02:53:51.631 --> 02:53:54.092]  And my point is that all bets are off.
[02:53:54.152 --> 02:53:59.534]  The day before Trump was assassinated, I was having dinner with a guy in LA and he asked me what I think is going to happen.
[02:53:59.554 --> 02:53:59.794]  I said,
[02:54:00.435 --> 02:54:03.117]  There's going to be a Black Swan event that's going to throw the whole thing into a state of flux.
[02:54:03.237 --> 02:54:07.361]  And literally in the next week or two, Trump was shot and Biden dropped off.
[02:54:07.381 --> 02:54:10.944]  So I think you're going to have two more things like that happen between now and November.
[02:54:10.984 --> 02:54:12.405]  And I don't know what they are.
[02:54:12.425 --> 02:54:13.907]  It could be some war.
[02:54:13.987 --> 02:54:15.288]  It could be a famine.
[02:54:15.328 --> 02:54:16.949]  It could be someone gets killed.
[02:54:17.430 --> 02:54:20.532]  But you're going to see that happen, and that's going to throw everything into a state of flux.
[02:54:20.572 --> 02:54:21.774]  Therefore, all bets are off.
[02:54:21.834 --> 02:54:24.256]  And the second part of that is whistleblowers.
[02:54:25.476 --> 02:54:33.421]  I am telling you, there is an explosion of people right now, on the inside, and I know that because they message me, and they trust me.
[02:54:33.621 --> 02:54:38.624]  But I have to figure out a way to give them life after whistleblowing, and I'm working on it.
[02:54:38.724 --> 02:54:43.527]  Whether that's some type of lump payment, there's an employee network of people that hire them.
[02:54:43.887 --> 02:54:50.331]  We've got to figure out a way to protect and nurture the people who are Secret Service agents, FBI agents, CIA agents.
[02:54:52.711 --> 02:54:52.891]  Yeah.
[02:54:53.371 --> 02:54:57.534]  We got to figure that out because I'm telling you there's something happening on the inside of these institutions.
[02:54:57.874 --> 02:55:03.277]  People have a conscience, they want to do the right thing, but they're going to get their lives destroyed for saying the truth.
[02:55:03.317 --> 02:55:04.458]  So that's what I'm currently working on.
[02:55:05.019 --> 02:55:06.059]  Well, I would tell them this.
[02:55:06.099 --> 02:55:07.240]  Look at the political climate.
[02:55:08.260 --> 02:55:09.982]  Keeping your head down, covering your asses.
[02:55:10.042 --> 02:55:11.142]  We're going to lose civilization.
[02:55:11.162 --> 02:55:12.003]  We're going to have nuclear war.
[02:55:12.023 --> 02:55:13.344]  We're going to have a totally collapsed country.
[02:55:13.384 --> 02:55:16.786]  So it's gotten so dangerous now they've got to do what I've done, what you've done.
[02:55:16.806 --> 02:55:18.867]  I've been on your show before and you talk about the fact that
[02:55:20.619 --> 02:55:21.821]  We put our lives on the line here.
[02:55:21.861 --> 02:55:22.842]  We're totally committed.
[02:55:23.223 --> 02:55:24.625]  And that's the attitude people have to have.
[02:55:24.685 --> 02:55:28.210]  And if society just gets that attitude again, then we can turn this around.
[02:55:29.071 --> 02:55:35.453]  Yeah, I met with, I was in Capitol Hill yesterday meeting with various lawmakers to figure out what the congressional protections are, the challenges.
[02:55:35.493 --> 02:55:37.474]  There aren't a lot of legislative protections.
[02:55:37.554 --> 02:55:38.554]  It's really more media.
[02:55:38.614 --> 02:55:42.375]  So, you know, OMG O'Keefe Media, we do the swiper thing.
[02:55:42.735 --> 02:55:44.296]  You can go out, get paid to do stories.
[02:55:44.716 --> 02:55:48.717]  And I have Citizen Journalism Foundation, which is now tax deductible, by the way.
[02:55:48.797 --> 02:55:50.278]  Thank God the IRS gave me that.
[02:55:50.778 --> 02:55:53.500]  And we're going to start giving grants out to whistleblowers if they blow the whistle.
[02:55:53.520 --> 02:56:04.527]  And if you're watching this program, and I know that you have a great audience, some really good, faithful people, God-fearing people, and you work for one of these institutions, you can message us, and we will talk to you.
[02:56:04.547 --> 02:56:11.050]  We have a whole room of people right now responding to people, particularly ActBlue, Alex, is another thing.
[02:56:11.070 --> 02:56:12.812]  Yeah, give us 60 seconds.
[02:56:12.832 --> 02:56:15.633]  People follow that, but people that don't know about ActBlue, you've caught them red-handed.
[02:56:15.913 --> 02:56:16.714]  Looks like laundering money.
[02:56:17.638 --> 02:56:24.224]  FEC money, FEC data shows that people who can't afford to are giving hundreds of thousands of dollars thousands of times.
[02:56:24.824 --> 02:56:26.506]  So it appears to be a money laundering scheme.
[02:56:26.886 --> 02:56:37.035]  We believe the money is coming from Europe or Asia and through Stripe and we're trying to get to the bottom of this and we have an explosion of people including
[02:56:37.995 --> 02:56:40.657]  At least one insider inside ActBlue.
[02:56:40.677 --> 02:56:45.801]  We have a mole inside ActBlue that told me where their conference is, the names of their employees.
[02:56:45.841 --> 02:56:51.065]  So I'm just saying that it's 10 to 100 times what it was a year or two ago.
[02:56:51.085 --> 02:56:55.148]  These explosion of people on the inside, we got to nurture that.
[02:56:55.348 --> 02:56:58.190]  It's going to require sacrifice.
[02:56:58.270 --> 02:57:06.896]  I get we're a world of people pursuing their own self-interest, but we got to find people who are willing to make sacrifices and be heroic.
[02:57:07.456 --> 02:57:09.497]  And show people what's going on.
[02:57:09.537 --> 02:57:11.318]  That's probably the biggest story of the election right there.
[02:57:11.859 --> 02:57:13.880]  Money laundering through ActBlue.
[02:57:14.340 --> 02:57:15.521]  We will get to the bottom of it.
[02:57:15.921 --> 02:57:17.782]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:17.842 --> 02:57:24.526]  I am Chase Geiser, your host for the next 45- 49 minutes, excuse me, before the Great War Room begins at 3 p.m.
[02:57:24.566 --> 02:57:28.929]  Central, hosted by the great Owen Schroyer himself, who's been doing an outstanding job.
[02:57:30.717 --> 02:57:34.658]  So in breaking news, we've seen that Kamala Harris has begun doing her rallies.
[02:57:34.738 --> 02:57:41.720]  They seem to be well attended, though much of the attendance seems to be because she's having celebrities perform before her rally.
[02:57:41.740 --> 02:57:46.281]  So when Trump hosts a rally, he is the celebrity that people show up to see.
[02:57:46.862 --> 02:57:56.244]  And when Kamala Harris hosts a rally, similar to how Joe Biden ran his campaign in 2020, they have to lean on celebrities to perform in order to get the crowd to show up.
[02:57:56.664 --> 02:57:58.885]  And then the crowds begin to dissipate.
[02:57:59.645 --> 02:58:02.107]  After the celebrities are done performing.
[02:58:02.127 --> 02:58:05.229]  I actually want to start off here with clip number nine.
[02:58:05.489 --> 02:58:08.190]  Sav did a great job covering what was happening at this rally.
[02:58:08.230 --> 02:58:10.052]  Now, granted, it was very well attended.
[02:58:10.292 --> 02:58:18.397]  There were a lot of people who stayed and we should never underestimate the power and the audacity of Kamala Harris, regardless of how bad Kamala Harris is.
[02:58:18.757 --> 02:58:26.001]  Just the fact that she can put a sentence together, in my opinion, makes her a greater threat to President Trump's campaign than Joe Biden was.
[02:58:26.021 --> 02:58:26.622]  And you can see
[02:58:27.222 --> 02:58:33.783]  That the Democrats are experiencing a major sigh of relief now that Joe Biden is no longer their candidate.
[02:58:33.803 --> 02:58:34.844]  Let's go ahead and run clip number nine.
[02:58:36.464 --> 02:58:41.485]  Hey guys, this is Savannah reporting to you from inside of Kamala Harris's rally, which just wrapped up.
[02:58:41.505 --> 02:58:47.826]  Now you guys saw all of the footage and there was actually a lot of energy for her in the building.
[02:58:48.306 --> 02:58:50.787]  Almost every single seat was filled, not every single one.
[02:58:51.167 --> 02:58:55.468]  But many people are questioning, well, were they here to see Kamala or were they here
[02:58:56.008 --> 02:58:57.209]  We're good to go.
[02:59:18.816 --> 02:59:19.937]  We're good to go.
[02:59:38.170 --> 02:59:40.352]  So it really is bizarre.
[02:59:55.689 --> 03:00:19.578]  When you just take a step back and look at what's happened with Kamala Harris over the course of the last basically several years, but especially in the last couple of weeks, because before she was officially the candidate for President of the United States being run by the Democratic Party, before she acquired through this coup all of these delegates needed in order to secure the nomination of the Democratic Party, she was basically ignored by both the left and the right.
[03:00:19.618 --> 03:00:25.300]  Everybody understood that she was cackling Kamala, that she was going to be responsible for a depopulation KamalaCost.
[03:00:25.840 --> 03:00:26.580]  We're good to go.
[03:00:52.285 --> 03:00:53.546]  As if they've always loved Kamala.
[03:00:53.566 --> 03:00:54.346]  She's always been great.
[03:00:54.386 --> 03:00:55.626]  She's always been so competent.
[03:00:55.646 --> 03:00:57.927]  She's the best thing that ever happened to democracy itself.
[03:00:58.367 --> 03:01:05.030]  It's very bizarre to see to what degree people really are non-player characters.
[03:01:05.190 --> 03:01:08.911]  They allow themselves to experience that cognitive dissonance.
[03:01:08.931 --> 03:01:10.192]  So we'll run clip 18 in a minute.
[03:01:10.252 --> 03:01:17.655]  But before we do that, I do want to give you some clips of Kamala Harris speaking.
[03:01:19.449 --> 03:01:26.734]  At various rallies and events over the course of the last couple days, just so you can listen to the audacity this woman has in terms of lies.
[03:01:26.774 --> 03:01:28.516]  Let's go ahead and run clip number one, please.
[03:01:35.921 --> 03:01:46.469]  Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk.
[03:01:48.622 --> 03:01:54.526]  Or as my friend Quavo would say, he does not walk it like he talks it.
[03:02:00.130 --> 03:02:01.411]  Yeah, well there you have it, folks.
[03:02:01.431 --> 03:02:05.453]  Let's run clip number two and see her challenging price gouging.
[03:02:07.415 --> 03:02:10.997]  On day one, I will take on price gouging and bring down costs.
[03:02:11.017 --> 03:02:12.018]  Why haven't you done it yet?
[03:02:12.058 --> 03:02:13.879]  You've been in this administration for four years.
[03:02:13.919 --> 03:02:16.601]  Why are you doing it on day one of your administration instead of taking care of it right now?
[03:02:17.682 --> 03:02:18.222]  Ridiculous.
[03:02:19.230 --> 03:02:27.816]  We will ban more of those hidden fees and surprise late charges that banks and other companies use to pad their profits.
[03:02:32.340 --> 03:02:37.604]  We will take on corporate landlords and cap unfair rent increases.
[03:02:43.234 --> 03:02:53.558]  And we will take on Big Pharma to cap prescription drug costs for all Americans.
[03:02:54.199 --> 03:03:01.201]  Our plan will lower costs and save many middle class families thousands of dollars a year.
[03:03:02.382 --> 03:03:05.223]  But Donald Trump has a different plan in mind.
[03:03:06.424 --> 03:03:09.805]  One that would raise prices on middle class families.
[03:03:10.725 --> 03:03:12.066]  So in this campaign,
[03:03:13.823 --> 03:03:22.954]  I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week.
[03:03:23.134 --> 03:03:24.255]  Any day of the week.
[03:03:27.421 --> 03:03:29.983]  Including, for example, on the issue of immigration.
[03:03:30.363 --> 03:03:32.445]  On the border, the choice is simple.
[03:03:32.785 --> 03:03:36.888]  Kamala Harris supports increasing the number of Border Patrol agents.
[03:03:37.208 --> 03:03:44.954]  And then after denying, of course, that she was the Border Czar, she runs an ad like this saying that she's better at the border than Donald Trump.
[03:03:45.174 --> 03:03:46.755]  Who in their right mind possibly believes this?
[03:03:47.456 --> 03:03:51.859]  Donald Trump blocked funding for technology to block fentanyl from entering the country.
[03:03:52.199 --> 03:03:56.120]  Kamala Harris supports spending more money to stop human traffickers.
[03:03:56.580 --> 03:03:59.660]  Donald Trump blocked money to stop human traffickers.
[03:04:00.021 --> 03:04:05.002]  Kamala Harris prosecuted transnational gang members and got them sentenced to prison.
[03:04:05.202 --> 03:04:08.102]  Trump is trying to avoid being sentenced to prison.
[03:04:08.622 --> 03:04:10.383]  There's two choices in this election.
[03:04:10.683 --> 03:04:13.483]  The one who will fix our broken immigration system.
[03:04:14.283 --> 03:04:17.164]  So she admits the immigration system is broken under her administration.
[03:04:18.204 --> 03:04:19.746]  Absolutely insane.
[03:04:19.786 --> 03:04:24.010]  Now, people have criticized Trump saying that he's too scared to debate Kamala Harris.
[03:04:24.030 --> 03:04:26.893]  First of all, she's not officially the candidate yet, so why would he waste his time?
[03:04:26.933 --> 03:04:31.939]  I'm sure that he would agree to debate her after the convention, or whoever the candidate is after the convention.
[03:04:31.979 --> 03:04:36.503]  There is going to be a presidential debate, I'm sure, before November 5th.
[03:04:36.544 --> 03:04:38.025]  But he was asked this question in clip number 16.
[03:04:38.365 --> 03:04:40.227]  He responds to the notion of
[03:04:41.397 --> 03:04:41.837]  Why not debate her?
[03:04:55.262 --> 03:04:56.844]  But because they already know everything.
[03:04:57.585 --> 03:04:59.026]  She wants to defund our police.
[03:04:59.687 --> 03:05:00.668]  She wants no bail.
[03:05:00.688 --> 03:05:02.470]  She wants no cash.
[03:05:02.530 --> 03:05:05.673]  You just, you kill somebody and we're going to release you immediately.
[03:05:06.134 --> 03:05:07.175]  They call it cashless.
[03:05:07.475 --> 03:05:08.176]  Cashless.
[03:05:09.097 --> 03:05:09.397]  That's it.
[03:05:09.518 --> 03:05:12.441]  By the way, this has been a horrible thing for our country.
[03:05:12.781 --> 03:05:14.283]  This has been what I just said.
[03:05:14.823 --> 03:05:14.964]  But
[03:05:15.624 --> 03:05:16.525]  We know where she is.
[03:05:16.565 --> 03:05:17.725]  She wants high taxes.
[03:05:18.285 --> 03:05:19.826]  Well, they're gonna say you're afraid of debating her.
[03:05:20.126 --> 03:05:20.867]  That's what they're gonna say.
[03:05:20.887 --> 03:05:22.307]  Well, they said that with Biden, too.
[03:05:22.367 --> 03:05:23.348]  You know, I was afraid.
[03:05:23.768 --> 03:05:26.489]  I did great with Biden, and I did great in every debate.
[03:05:26.549 --> 03:05:27.790]  I've had a lot of debates.
[03:05:28.650 --> 03:05:30.131]  But you're winning at all the issues, right?
[03:05:30.151 --> 03:05:32.452]  You know, I'm leading in the polls by, I think, a lot.
[03:05:32.532 --> 03:05:32.893]  I don't know.
[03:05:32.913 --> 03:05:33.753]  I hear different numbers.
[03:05:34.193 --> 03:05:36.014]  But I'm leading in all of the polls.
[03:05:36.074 --> 03:05:37.115]  I'm leading big in all of the issues.
[03:05:37.135 --> 03:05:41.157]  Then they had the audacity to say that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy, even though...
[03:05:42.057 --> 03:05:51.605]  Kamala Harris has positioned herself politically to be the nominee for the Democratic Party without earning a single primary vote from the Democratic voters.
[03:05:52.065 --> 03:05:53.907]  They did the same thing, a very similar thing back in 2016.
[03:05:54.767 --> 03:06:10.500]  If you remember, there were so many Bernie supporters that felt so disenfranchised with the Democratic Party, so cheated by the Democratic Party, after they stole the primary from him in a very questionable way in favor of Hillary Clinton, who's like the female face of the CIA.
[03:06:11.869 --> 03:06:15.151]  And the moral equivalent of the CIA, basically, at this point.
[03:06:16.251 --> 03:06:18.152]  That these Bernie Sanders supporters voted for Trump.
[03:06:18.192 --> 03:06:29.878]  Now they've stolen this primary away from the entire Democratic Party because absolutely no one voted for Kamala Harris to be the candidate for President of the United States for the Democratic Party.
[03:06:30.802 --> 03:06:37.248]  So it wasn't like before where at least, you know, about half or a large percentage of the Democrats actually did support Hillary.
[03:06:37.268 --> 03:06:42.352]  So when it was stolen, there was still a substantial amount of their base that had voted for her in the primary.
[03:06:42.392 --> 03:06:43.854]  This time it's absolutely nil.
[03:06:43.874 --> 03:06:44.955]  So what do you think is going to happen?
[03:06:45.697 --> 03:06:47.619]  Well, I think they're going to vote for the populist candidate.
[03:06:48.159 --> 03:06:52.643]  I think many people are very frustrated with this coup that took place.
[03:06:52.663 --> 03:07:10.619]  So while they accuse Donald Trump of being a threat to democracy, they literally sabotage, subvert, and use Machiavellian utilitarian tactics against democracy every single step of the way while they smile at you and pretend that they love the democratic process and they want the people to be represented so badly.
[03:07:10.659 --> 03:07:11.620]  This is clip number five.
[03:07:12.799 --> 03:07:14.982]  I'm the opposite of a threat to democracy.
[03:07:15.022 --> 03:07:16.344]  They're a threat to democracy.
[03:07:16.364 --> 03:07:17.885]  I mean, look at what they just did.
[03:07:18.206 --> 03:07:18.606]  They just...
[03:07:19.500 --> 03:07:21.822]  Took over the presidency from a president.
[03:07:21.842 --> 03:07:23.183]  This was a coup.
[03:07:23.964 --> 03:07:26.506]  Biden is a very angry man right now.
[03:07:26.526 --> 03:07:27.046]  You know that.
[03:07:27.566 --> 03:07:28.927]  They took the presidency away.
[03:07:28.987 --> 03:07:30.348]  His wife didn't want it to happen.
[03:07:31.129 --> 03:07:33.831]  They took the presidency away like he was a child.
[03:07:34.031 --> 03:07:36.233]  Who's making the decisions right now in the White House, do you think?
[03:07:37.094 --> 03:07:40.576]  A group of people that are fascists, communists, Marxists.
[03:07:41.377 --> 03:07:44.660]  They circle the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.
[03:07:47.159 --> 03:07:54.382]  I think Joe Rogan and Michael Malice really summed it up best in this clip, so we'll just cut right to it and then we'll move on to more news.
[03:07:54.422 --> 03:07:54.782]  Clip number 18.
[03:08:12.987 --> 03:08:15.730]  It all bothers me the fragility of the human mind.
[03:08:16.270 --> 03:08:23.737]  You know that we're so everybody forever was like Kamala Harris is the worst vice president.
[03:08:23.857 --> 03:08:27.080]  She's the least popular vice president of all time.
[03:08:27.480 --> 03:08:29.002]  And then in a moment.
[03:08:30.963 --> 03:08:33.546]  A moment in time, all of a sudden, she's our solution.
[03:08:33.946 --> 03:08:34.847]  She's our hero.
[03:08:35.347 --> 03:08:36.228]  Everybody's with her.
[03:08:36.769 --> 03:08:38.550]  All these social media posts about her.
[03:08:39.111 --> 03:08:42.014]  Try Googling a negative story on her.
[03:08:42.074 --> 03:08:43.095]  You won't find one.
[03:08:43.115 --> 03:08:44.096]  So, ta-da!
[03:08:45.817 --> 03:08:47.199]  You've got me started, Officer Harris.
[03:08:50.498 --> 03:08:52.719]  They've been doing this live for years.
[03:08:53.200 --> 03:08:59.003]  So in 2019, our pal Tulsi absolutely nuked her in that second debate.
[03:08:59.483 --> 03:09:04.867]  And if you looked at charts at the time, she's kind of, Officer Harris, is doing okay.
[03:09:05.207 --> 03:09:07.708]  First debate she comes out, Joe Biden, you're a racist.
[03:09:08.188 --> 03:09:11.430]  The Democrats were looking for an alternative to Bernie Sanders that wasn't Biden.
[03:09:11.470 --> 03:09:13.031]  She starts going up in the polls, right?
[03:09:13.492 --> 03:09:16.834]  Second debate comes out, Tulsi, being a good Hawaiian, knows how to roast the pig.
[03:09:16.854 --> 03:09:18.695]  Just completely slams her.
[03:09:19.455 --> 03:09:20.796]  Not only that, she has no counterpunch.
[03:09:20.816 --> 03:09:25.140]  She goes on Anderson Cooper and she's like, well, I'm a top tier candidate, so of course people are going to take shots at me.
[03:09:25.440 --> 03:09:26.121]  That's her answer.
[03:09:26.601 --> 03:09:28.423]  She immediately starts going down in the polls.
[03:09:28.543 --> 03:09:29.263]  It's that day.
[03:09:29.304 --> 03:09:31.065]  You can see it on the chart I have on my Twitter.
[03:09:31.906 --> 03:09:38.892]  All the articles at the time that did an autopsy on Kamala Harris's failed campaign didn't mention Tulsi once.
[03:09:39.412 --> 03:09:39.612]  Yeah.
[03:09:39.733 --> 03:09:43.777]  It was BBC, LA Times, Reuters, New Yorker.
[03:09:44.138 --> 03:09:47.202]  A guy from the Washington Post just did a piece looking back on her campaign.
[03:09:47.402 --> 03:09:48.363]  Didn't mention Tulsi either.
[03:09:48.383 --> 03:09:49.384]  Isn't that wild?
[03:09:49.404 --> 03:09:51.987]  They completely pretend it didn't happen.
[03:09:52.148 --> 03:09:56.072]  Well, it just shows you that what they're looking for is not what they say they're looking for.
[03:09:56.092 --> 03:09:56.152]  Yes.
[03:09:56.693 --> 03:09:58.994]  Because she is a strong woman.
[03:09:59.454 --> 03:10:06.976]  She is a person who served overseas twice in a medical unit, so she got to see people blown up by the war.
[03:10:07.577 --> 03:10:10.318]  She was a congresswoman for eight years.
[03:10:10.938 --> 03:10:11.978]  She is a person of color.
[03:10:11.998 --> 03:10:12.878]  She's everything you want.
[03:10:13.339 --> 03:10:14.239]  All those things you want.
[03:10:15.223 --> 03:10:16.083]  Yeah, you don't want her.
[03:10:16.103 --> 03:10:16.924]  Because she's not for war.
[03:10:17.384 --> 03:10:17.624]  Yes.
[03:10:18.164 --> 03:10:20.465]  Well, she's also just not willing to play ball.
[03:10:20.505 --> 03:10:22.046]  There's a game that's being played.
[03:10:22.326 --> 03:10:25.247]  And if you're like, hey, you're not supposed to move the ball.
[03:10:25.428 --> 03:10:26.728]  Like, oh, look at this over here.
[03:10:27.168 --> 03:10:28.009]  Like, get out of here.
[03:10:28.169 --> 03:10:29.349]  You're gonna f*** up our game.
[03:10:29.809 --> 03:10:31.250]  It's not real.
[03:10:31.390 --> 03:10:34.572]  And the fact of the matter is, folks, not even her former staffers like her.
[03:10:34.592 --> 03:10:40.974]  Former staffers have described her as a workplace bully prone to angry tirades.
[03:10:41.054 --> 03:10:41.735]  I think that this is
[03:10:42.555 --> 03:10:47.483]  Something that can be easily interpreted as true just based off of her appearance and demeanor and the way that she acts.
[03:10:47.623 --> 03:10:51.008]  She's obviously a cackling, irrational, erratic woman.
[03:10:52.430 --> 03:10:52.550]  And...
[03:10:53.792 --> 03:11:04.577]  If none of her staffers liked her, if none of America likes her, and we have this big tech censorship just working to silence any of this naysaying, it begs the question, does anybody actually support her?
[03:11:04.617 --> 03:11:06.538]  Are any of these polls accurate whatsoever?
[03:11:06.598 --> 03:11:18.784]  Now, we shouldn't underestimate her because people do show up to her rallies and they will continue to show up to her rallies as the machine pumps money into her brand and her campaign and her lies about her accomplishments and how great she always has been.
[03:11:19.804 --> 03:11:24.567]  We should not underestimate her, but the fact of the matter is this is a very vulnerable candidate.
[03:11:24.607 --> 03:11:34.632]  This is a weak candidate for the Democrats, and if we play our cards right, and we play with focus and intentionality, then we should be able to defeat this person without any problem on November 5th.
[03:11:34.712 --> 03:11:36.854]  Now, I suspect that she might not even be the candidate.
[03:11:36.874 --> 03:11:40.035]  She may lose all of her support by the time the convention rolls around.
[03:11:40.356 --> 03:11:44.238]  I still do believe that she is going to be the President of the United States before January.
[03:11:44.278 --> 03:11:44.638]  I think that
[03:11:44.998 --> 03:11:50.102]  Joe Biden is going to resign as the President of the United States if he doesn't die.
[03:11:50.983 --> 03:11:56.868]  And I think that we are going to see Kamala Harris as president, but I don't think that we're going to see her win this election, but we have to stay focused if we want to.
[03:11:56.908 --> 03:12:12.781]  And speaking of mainstream media cover-ups, we've seen countless reports this week of Google censoring Donald Trump's search results, Gemini and other AI platforms refusing to answer questions about the assassination, different images on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram of
[03:12:13.502 --> 03:12:20.108]  Donald Trump's assassination being blocked or removed or flagged as false, even though they were the original image not altered whatsoever.
[03:12:20.468 --> 03:12:24.111]  They've since apologized for this and feigned regret.
[03:12:24.812 --> 03:12:28.995]  But now we see this clip in 20 here of the shooter running across the roof.
[03:12:29.456 --> 03:12:32.899]  All of this, you can just run it as B-roll, all of this in the context of
[03:12:34.141 --> 03:12:35.482]  This new cover-up report.
[03:12:35.602 --> 03:12:37.182]  Now, Jamie White is one of the best writers here.
[03:12:37.202 --> 03:12:38.743]  He does such a fantastic job.
[03:12:39.623 --> 03:12:46.186]  Secret Service rejects FOIA requests for any records about assassination attempt on President Trump.
[03:12:46.806 --> 03:12:47.806]  Well, there you have it folks.
[03:12:47.846 --> 03:12:51.468]  The Secret Service is not allowing the Freedom of Information Act to run its course.
[03:12:51.808 --> 03:12:54.349]  They are keeping everything secret about what happened to Donald Trump.
[03:12:55.339 --> 03:13:05.845]  Because it would be very politically damaging to them and the leftist deep state and the globalist New World Order political agenda if the people were actually given accurate information as to what happened on that day.
[03:13:05.925 --> 03:13:16.111]  When you assassinate someone or attempt to assassinate someone, of course you're not going to release all the documents you have or information or data that you have to the public when it's requested through a legal democratic process.
[03:13:16.411 --> 03:13:17.832]  But let's look here in clip number 13.
[03:13:18.412 --> 03:13:24.456]  This is the FBI responding again to questions of whether or not Donald Trump was actually struck by a bullet.
[03:13:26.246 --> 03:13:30.029]  You are the Deputy Director of the FBI, is that correct?
[03:13:30.249 --> 03:13:30.829]  Yes, Senator.
[03:13:32.771 --> 03:13:53.386]  Is there any doubt in your mind or in the collective mind of the FBI that President Trump was shot in the ear by a bullet fired by the assassin crooks?
[03:13:53.446 --> 03:13:55.187]  Senator, there is absolutely no doubt
[03:13:56.141 --> 03:14:06.543]  In the FBI's mind, whether former President Trump was hit with a bullet and wounded in the ear, no doubt there never has been.
[03:14:07.243 --> 03:14:11.604]  I've been part of this investigation since the very beginning and that has never been raised.
[03:14:11.984 --> 03:14:12.424]  You're sure?
[03:14:13.084 --> 03:14:13.284]  Yes.
[03:14:14.404 --> 03:14:15.824]  It wasn't a space laser?
[03:14:17.705 --> 03:14:17.885]  No.
[03:14:19.065 --> 03:14:20.345]  It wasn't a murder hornet?
[03:14:22.046 --> 03:14:22.646]  Absolutely not.
[03:14:23.286 --> 03:14:24.506]  It wasn't Sasquatch?
[03:14:25.768 --> 03:14:26.248]  No Senator.
[03:14:26.848 --> 03:14:27.649]  It was a bullet.
[03:14:28.209 --> 03:14:29.409]  It was a bullet Senator.
[03:14:29.609 --> 03:14:30.709]  Fired by crooks.
[03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:34.951]  Now I believe it was earlier this week that Christopher Wray suggested it could have been shrapnel.
[03:14:34.991 --> 03:14:35.751]  Maybe it wasn't a bullet.
[03:14:35.771 --> 03:14:38.852]  So does this mean that Christopher Wray had perjured himself?
[03:14:38.892 --> 03:14:41.633]  Had lied before Congress when he was answering questions about this?
[03:14:41.973 --> 03:14:46.474]  The inconsistencies indicate some sort of a schism within the intelligence community itself.
[03:14:46.514 --> 03:14:49.775]  Some sort of a schism within the Secret Service itself.
[03:14:50.842 --> 03:14:52.103]  Our whole nation's in shambles.
[03:14:52.143 --> 03:14:53.184]  The White House is in shambles.
[03:14:53.244 --> 03:14:54.685]  We have to take this country back, folks.
[03:14:54.885 --> 03:14:56.767]  Stay tuned for more news on the other side.

[03:15:13.760 --> 03:15:16.963]  I couldn't operate in the last 10 years without my morning green drink.

[03:16:32.703 --> 03:16:40.069]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's salt palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts.
[03:16:40.490 --> 03:16:44.153]  It affects the same type of tissues that have those hormonal fluctuations.
[03:16:44.213 --> 03:16:45.474]  I'm not a doctor, but I read the literature.
[03:16:45.494 --> 03:16:55.562]  You need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line, over a dozen products, InfoWars MD.
[03:16:58.214 --> 03:17:00.495]  I'm gonna look you in the eyes, and I'm gonna tell you the future.
[03:17:01.275 --> 03:17:04.436]  It's an American story, and that's why Americans are gonna love it.
[03:17:05.696 --> 03:17:06.776]  People are gonna build you up.
[03:17:07.476 --> 03:17:08.597]  God, are they going to.
[03:17:09.277 --> 03:17:12.938]  Because when you're great and new, we love you.
[03:17:14.258 --> 03:17:16.599]  Man, we'll build you into something that doesn't even exist.
[03:17:17.019 --> 03:17:18.419]  You're gonna change the fucking world.
[03:17:20.480 --> 03:17:21.040]  But you know what?
[03:17:22.558 --> 03:17:27.382]  Once they've built you as high as they possibly can, they're gonna tear you back down.
[03:17:27.842 --> 03:17:29.664]  It's the most predictable pattern.
[03:17:29.904 --> 03:17:34.027]  We build you into something that doesn't exist, and that means you have to try to be that thing.
[03:17:34.828 --> 03:17:36.549]  All day, every day.
[03:17:37.090 --> 03:17:37.870]  That's how it works.
[03:17:38.270 --> 03:17:41.093]  And we do it again, and again, and again.
[03:17:41.533 --> 03:17:43.735]  And I'm gonna tell you the truth.
[03:17:44.675 --> 03:17:49.619]  You're gonna be attacked, betrayed, exposed, and humiliated.
[03:17:50.640 --> 03:17:51.441]  And you'll survive that.
[03:17:53.544 --> 03:17:55.085]  A lot of people can climb that mountain.
[03:17:56.105 --> 03:17:58.307]  It's the way down that breaks them.
[03:18:00.608 --> 03:18:04.250]  Because that's the moment when you are truly alone.
[03:18:07.831 --> 03:18:09.372]  And what will you do then?
[03:18:10.453 --> 03:18:14.995]  Can you summon the will to fight on through all the pain and rise again?
[03:18:15.896 --> 03:18:18.357]  That will be the defining question of your life.
[03:18:19.528 --> 03:18:21.551]  And I think you already know the answer.
[03:18:22.272 --> 03:18:23.714]  And that's why we're all here.
[03:18:25.377 --> 03:18:26.698]  A shoe is just a shoe.
[03:18:28.261 --> 03:18:29.723]  Until somebody steps into it.
[03:18:33.744 --> 03:18:36.066]  The rest of us just want a chance to touch that greatness.
[03:18:36.766 --> 03:18:41.249]  We need you in these shoes, not so you have meaning in your life, but so that we have meaning in ours.
[03:18:42.609 --> 03:18:46.312]  Everyone will be forgotten as soon as our time here is up.
[03:18:47.572 --> 03:18:48.153]  Except for you.
[03:18:48.173 --> 03:18:51.555]  You're gonna be remembered forever.
[03:18:51.575 --> 03:18:53.936]  Because some things are eternal.
[03:18:54.056 --> 03:18:57.398]  And your story is gonna make us fight and never give up.
[03:19:01.101 --> 03:19:15.709]  So while Americans are choosing between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, we've seen evidence after evidence after evidence that Donald Trump is basically, in the eyes of all other nations, more the president of the United States now than even Joe Biden.
[03:19:15.729 --> 03:19:30.137]  When you have President Trump meeting with world leaders, calling world leaders, this is something they used to criticize him for doing years ago when they were trying to uphold the lie that Joe Biden was acting as president, but now they can't even
[03:19:31.551 --> 03:19:35.774]  Really respond in that way with criticism, because after all, who is doing the job?
[03:19:35.814 --> 03:19:41.538]  I mean, for a long time people discussed, was it Barack Obama who was actually acting as President of the United States?
[03:19:41.578 --> 03:19:43.259]  Was it a committee?
[03:19:43.319 --> 03:19:44.219]  Was it the deep state?
[03:19:44.259 --> 03:19:48.402]  Was it staffers and interns who were running the White House?
[03:19:48.582 --> 03:19:57.108]  And I think after the debate on June 27th, it became abundantly clear that the answer to the question as to who is running the White House is no one is running the White House.
[03:19:57.128 --> 03:19:58.069]  I mean, there was a coup.
[03:19:58.869 --> 03:19:59.190]  I don't know.
[03:20:18.834 --> 03:20:29.261]  Just following up on Senator Minn's question, could you sort of give us an idea of how much the President's schedule has changed since the ticket changed?
[03:20:29.301 --> 03:20:33.364]  Because if you look at what we look at, the big event on Tuesday was a phone call.
[03:20:33.384 --> 03:20:34.925]  The big event today is a lunch.
[03:20:35.286 --> 03:20:36.767]  Tomorrow, we don't know what he's doing.
[03:20:36.847 --> 03:20:38.088]  Friday, he heads to Delaware.
[03:20:38.628 --> 03:20:42.431]  It lends itself to the appearance that he's done governing.
[03:20:42.791 --> 03:20:44.053]  No, he's not done governing at all.
[03:20:44.073 --> 03:20:45.515]  I think that appearance would be false.
[03:20:45.795 --> 03:20:47.778]  It would be a misled appearance.
[03:20:48.218 --> 03:20:49.219]  I understand the question.
[03:20:49.260 --> 03:20:52.303]  What I will say, we were in Austin on Monday.
[03:20:52.484 --> 03:20:54.546]  We were obviously in Texas.
[03:20:54.566 --> 03:20:55.808]  We went to Austin, went to Houston.
[03:20:55.848 --> 03:20:57.871]  He went to pay his respects to the late Congresswoman.
[03:20:58.311 --> 03:20:58.931]  We're good to go.
[03:21:17.140 --> 03:21:18.041]  Yeah, meet with his team of doctors.
[03:21:34.753 --> 03:21:35.874]  We are recalibrating.
[03:21:35.994 --> 03:21:37.055]  I mean, that is very true.
[03:21:37.075 --> 03:21:44.022]  I mean, there is a change in just him stepping down for re-election.
[03:21:44.062 --> 03:21:45.523]  He's still very much the president.
[03:21:45.863 --> 03:21:48.406]  And we're trying to figure out what the next six months are going to look like.
[03:21:48.986 --> 03:21:54.652]  But we are committed, the president is steadfast on continuing to build on the unprecedented record.
[03:21:54.992 --> 03:21:55.072]  No.
[03:22:10.726 --> 03:22:17.151]  The whole world is falling apart while Joe Biden fails to fulfill the duties of the office of the President of the United States.
[03:22:17.631 --> 03:22:20.233]  And it was failing while he was allegedly performing those duties.
[03:22:20.293 --> 03:22:24.537]  It's been failing basically ever since the COVID pandemic was launched.
[03:22:24.697 --> 03:22:32.803]  That was the beginning of the falling apart of the world, and then it was a nail in the coffin when they stole the election from Donald Trump, and it's been a disaster over the course of the last three years.
[03:22:32.863 --> 03:22:35.425]  Now we have Kiev Mayor Klitschko.
[03:22:39.728 --> 03:22:46.152]  Saying that Zelensky is likely to agree to territorial compromises with Russia, so they're ready to surrender.
[03:22:46.272 --> 03:22:48.293]  They want to negotiate the terms of surrender.
[03:22:48.894 --> 03:22:54.097]  This is all happening while the leader of Hamas was assassinated in Tehran.
[03:22:54.577 --> 03:23:04.163]  Now we have reports coming out that Iran has made orders to its armed forces to be ready for a direct strike on Israel.
[03:23:04.843 --> 03:23:07.305]  When we were thinking that Erdogan or others were going to
[03:23:08.686 --> 03:23:09.907]  Perform some sort of an invasion.
[03:23:09.947 --> 03:23:12.608]  It seems like World War 3 is actually ramping up.
[03:23:12.628 --> 03:23:18.432]  The only de-escalation I see is that the mayor of Kiev is admitting that Zelensky's ready to surrender, which would be a good thing.
[03:23:18.452 --> 03:23:22.654]  It would be a de-escalation of an unnecessary war that cannot be won by anyone except for Russia.
[03:23:23.015 --> 03:23:24.095]  It's just a matter of time.
[03:23:24.395 --> 03:23:29.278]  But here we are in clip number... Let's see, clip number 23.
[03:23:31.590 --> 03:23:38.254]  Watching Attorney General Mary Garland say that they have intelligence that Iran is planning to assassinate President Trump.
[03:23:38.314 --> 03:23:38.934]  This is clip 23.
[03:23:39.995 --> 03:23:44.678]  Garland telling us more about the Iranian threat against Mr. Trump and other former U.S.
[03:23:44.738 --> 03:23:45.178]  officials.
[03:23:45.538 --> 03:23:54.964]  Our intelligence community has made clear that we believe that the Iranians are attempting to kill or injure former high government officials.
[03:23:55.404 --> 03:23:56.825]  This is an ongoing issue.
[03:23:56.845 --> 03:23:58.646]  We have ongoing investigations.
[03:23:59.047 --> 03:24:00.027]  You don't think we've seen the end?
[03:24:00.147 --> 03:24:01.308]  I don't think we've seen the end.
[03:24:01.508 --> 03:24:11.896]  And we know that there are clips that go all the way back to 2001, where our own military-industrial complex, our own deep state, has been wanting to go to war with Iran for decades.
[03:24:11.936 --> 03:24:14.538]  They've been planning war with Iran for decades.
[03:24:14.898 --> 03:24:23.045]  They understand that Iran is an existential threat to Israel, and they make the claim that Iran is responsible for funding terrorism in the region.
[03:24:23.085 --> 03:24:26.848]  And it probably is responsible for funding terrorism in the region because it hates Israel.
[03:24:27.268 --> 03:24:33.382]  And it hates the United States, and it hates the fact that the United States has the global reserve currency, which we abuse!
[03:24:34.386 --> 03:24:40.029]  To impose sanctions on countries like China and Russia and Iran, where they aren't even able to access their own money.
[03:24:40.049 --> 03:24:51.454]  As soon as they convert this money to dollars after they trade oil, which they're required to do in dollar denominations, then we freeze these bank accounts, wherever they are all over the world, as long as they are in dollars, and we withhold money.
[03:24:51.474 --> 03:24:58.558]  And this has created a level of bitterness that has catalyzed their desire to fund terrorism, to do things like work out
[03:24:59.358 --> 03:25:10.803]  Subversive deals with various nations in Africa that have access to uranium and through a black market will secretly and illegally trade with these countries to get the uranium to develop a nuclear weapon.
[03:25:10.823 --> 03:25:14.465]  Frankly, I think that Iran and Israel both have nuclear weapons and have for years.
[03:25:14.525 --> 03:25:18.687]  It's always Netanyahu claiming that Iran is two weeks away from a nuclear weapon.
[03:25:18.747 --> 03:25:20.128]  They have one already.
[03:25:20.728 --> 03:25:22.749]  And now they're claiming that they're going to strike Israel.
[03:25:23.069 --> 03:25:24.850]  It's bizarre to me that this is happening.
[03:25:26.923 --> 03:25:46.563]  All in the context of our own deep state, our own military industrial complex coming out and saying that Iran was really the one that wanted to assassinate Donald Trump, that Iran is plotting to assassinate Donald Trump when we know it was our own deep state with all the cell phone data, with all the mystery and secrecy and inconsistencies around the narrative of what happened on July 13th, 2024.
[03:25:49.346 --> 03:25:52.209]  It was truly everything that they said January 6th was.
[03:25:52.249 --> 03:25:57.674]  It was an insurrection, a coup, an attempt to kill political leaders in the name of a political end.
[03:25:59.008 --> 03:26:00.990]  And now they want war with Iran?
[03:26:01.070 --> 03:26:02.591]  Iran which is backed by China?
[03:26:02.611 --> 03:26:04.133]  Iran which is backed by Russia?
[03:26:04.493 --> 03:26:08.837]  All while Russia's in this war and Taiwan has, or excuse me, China has its eyes on Taiwan?
[03:26:09.198 --> 03:26:21.610]  This is an escalation that is happening right before our eyes because the whole world now realizes, all the leaders of the world, all the intelligence agencies of the world, realize that not only is Joe Biden
[03:26:23.010 --> 03:26:37.177]  In cognitive decline, not only is Joe Biden incapable of running the White House, but now it is abundantly clear that Joe Biden has no support among the party, among leaders in any way, shape, or form.
[03:26:37.397 --> 03:26:38.798]  He's not running things at all.
[03:26:39.358 --> 03:26:41.860]  He's got no command, no presence, no actual control.
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:46.904]  All of the political leverage within his own party, his own administration, is actually against him and forced him out.
[03:26:47.124 --> 03:26:48.485]  He's not even doing the job anymore.
[03:26:48.806 --> 03:26:51.608]  This is when enemies of the United States act.
[03:26:51.908 --> 03:26:53.710]  When they know that we are weak.
[03:26:53.990 --> 03:26:55.952]  When we know that our leadership is divided.
[03:26:56.172 --> 03:26:57.853]  When they know that we are distracted.
[03:26:57.893 --> 03:27:02.277]  And so I am very concerned that this recent development with Iran could lead
[03:27:02.697 --> 03:27:02.957]  It's
[03:27:32.637 --> 03:27:41.602]  I'm terrified of this, but as the leftists say that Donald Trump is a racist, as they say that Kamala Harris is an African American, as they say that J.D.
[03:27:41.662 --> 03:27:47.405]  Vance is weird and that they are not the party that is weird, we have clips like clip number 14 here.
[03:27:47.726 --> 03:27:55.690]  This is just an example of someone who I'm almost positive, though this person does not state this in the video, I'm almost positive this person is not voting for Donald Trump.
[03:27:55.710 --> 03:28:00.733]  So you tell me after seeing this clip, which candidate, which party is the party of weird?
[03:28:02.370 --> 03:28:05.957]  I am a woman and I use the women's restroom.
[03:28:06.758 --> 03:28:11.126]  And I guarantee you, not one of you will stop me.
[03:28:11.587 --> 03:28:13.310]  And if you got a problem with it,
[03:28:23.246 --> 03:28:29.753]  Now all in the context of Donald Trump being accused of being too afraid to debate Kamala Harris.
[03:28:29.833 --> 03:28:34.638]  And keep in mind, that's what they said about his debate with Joe Biden, that he was too afraid to do it.
[03:28:35.078 --> 03:28:45.601]  And he did it and he agreed to all of their outrageous terms for this debate on June 27th because he knew all he had to do was keep his mouth shut and Joe Biden would walk himself into a late grave.
[03:28:46.741 --> 03:28:51.883]  But now we have him going to speak at the National Association of Black Journalists.
[03:28:53.163 --> 03:28:55.704]  So, answer me this question.
[03:28:56.124 --> 03:29:02.626]  How is it that one could make the claim that Donald Trump is too afraid to debate Kamala Harris
[03:29:04.261 --> 03:29:08.823]  All while he is speaking to the National Association of Black Journalists.
[03:29:09.144 --> 03:29:10.804]  I mean, that's a very unfriendly environment.
[03:29:11.084 --> 03:29:14.726]  These people are, I assume, smart, certainly smarter than Kamala Harris.
[03:29:14.746 --> 03:29:16.187]  They're going to ask tough questions.
[03:29:16.347 --> 03:29:17.228]  They're not on his side.
[03:29:17.268 --> 03:29:26.032]  This is not a t-ball, a toss-up, some easy press conference, press release, press spot where he can tout his brilliant answers to their friendly questions.
[03:29:26.332 --> 03:29:31.455]  He knows that this is a lion's den, that they're going to come after him immediately, and they did, but he does it anyway.
[03:29:31.475 --> 03:29:33.276]  So the reason he's not debating
[03:29:34.116 --> 03:29:36.738]  Kamala Harris, yeah, it is because first of all, she's not the candidate.
[03:29:37.079 --> 03:29:41.863]  Second of all, everybody knows what she has to say, what he has to say, so it is truly a waste of time.
[03:29:42.103 --> 03:29:49.509]  He even mentioned that the debate on June 27th was a total waste of time and they should be fighting for the American people instead of wasting everyone's time on national television for a couple of hours.
[03:29:50.150 --> 03:29:57.496]  But here he is in clip number 19, responding to the very first question out of the gate from the National Association of Black Journalists.
[03:29:58.510 --> 03:30:03.012]  You have used words like animal and rabbit to describe black district attorneys.
[03:30:03.612 --> 03:30:09.535]  You've attacked black journalists, calling them a loser, saying the questions that they ask are, quote, stupid and racist.
[03:30:10.195 --> 03:30:12.936]  You've had dinner with a white supremacist at your Mar-a-Lago resort.
[03:30:13.777 --> 03:30:23.401]  So my question, sir, now that you are asking black supporters to vote for you, why should black voters trust you after you have used language like that?
[03:30:24.802 --> 03:30:27.763]  Well, first of all, I don't think I've ever been asked a question
[03:30:28.582 --> 03:30:32.246]  So, in such a horrible manner, first question.
[03:30:32.907 --> 03:30:35.450]  You don't even say, hello, how are you?
[03:30:36.171 --> 03:30:37.252]  Are you with ABC?
[03:30:37.272 --> 03:30:40.555]  Because I think they're a fake news network, a terrible network.
[03:30:41.777 --> 03:30:46.062]  And I think it's disgraceful that I came here.
[03:30:46.889 --> 03:30:47.630]  In good spirit.
[03:30:48.831 --> 03:30:51.013]  I love the black population of this country.
[03:30:51.093 --> 03:30:54.015]  I've done so much for the black population of this country.
[03:30:54.355 --> 03:31:06.826]  Some of your own supporters, including Republicans on Capitol Hill, have labeled Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the first black and Asian American woman to serve as Vice President, be on a major party ticket as a DEI hire.
[03:31:07.446 --> 03:31:09.288]  Is that acceptable language to you?
[03:31:09.708 --> 03:31:12.971]  And will you tell those Republicans and those supporters to stop it?
[03:31:13.291 --> 03:31:15.052]  How do you, how do you define DEI?
[03:31:15.092 --> 03:31:15.892]  Go ahead.
[03:31:16.452 --> 03:31:17.032]  How do you define it?
[03:31:17.052 --> 03:31:18.373]  Diversity, equity, inclusion?
[03:31:18.473 --> 03:31:19.473]  Okay, yeah, go ahead.
[03:31:19.573 --> 03:31:20.754]  Is that what your definition?
[03:31:20.794 --> 03:31:21.954]  That is, that is literally the words.
[03:31:21.994 --> 03:31:23.134]  Give me a definition then.
[03:31:23.154 --> 03:31:24.315]  Would you give me a definition of that?
[03:31:24.335 --> 03:31:24.455]  DEI.
[03:31:25.035 --> 03:31:25.975]  Give me a definition.
[03:31:26.015 --> 03:31:27.616]  Sir, I'm asking you a question, a very direct question.
[03:31:27.636 --> 03:31:28.276]  No, no, you have to define it.
[03:31:28.296 --> 03:31:30.217]  Define the, define it for me if you will.
[03:31:30.237 --> 03:31:31.117]  I just defined it, sir.
[03:31:31.137 --> 03:31:35.419]  Do you believe that Vice President Kamala Harris is only on the ticket because she is a black woman?
[03:31:35.539 --> 03:31:38.780]  Well, I can say, no, I think it's maybe a little bit different, so.
[03:31:40.141 --> 03:31:50.550]  I've known her a long time indirectly, not directly very much and she was always of Indian heritage and she was only promoting Indian heritage.
[03:31:50.650 --> 03:31:56.856]  I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black and now she wants to be known as black.
[03:31:57.456 --> 03:31:59.676]  So I don't know, is she Indian or is she black?
[03:31:59.696 --> 03:32:01.217]  She is always identified as a black.
[03:32:01.277 --> 03:32:03.017]  I respect either one.
[03:32:03.117 --> 03:32:05.177]  I respect either one, but she obviously doesn't.
[03:32:05.237 --> 03:32:06.658]  Absolutely hysterical there.
[03:32:06.758 --> 03:32:07.638]  Great response.
[03:32:07.958 --> 03:32:12.319]  That journalist was lying and refusing to define DEI, diversity, equity and inclusion.
[03:32:12.699 --> 03:32:14.079]  She says what the words stand for.
[03:32:14.119 --> 03:32:22.621]  She answered what the acronym was, but she doesn't define what it means in terms of policy and implications, which is what Trump was obviously asking for.
[03:32:22.641 --> 03:32:24.301]  And the fact of the matter is, it's true.
[03:32:24.861 --> 03:32:27.882]  Kamala Harris, I believe, is descended from an Indian and a Jamaican.
[03:32:27.923 --> 03:32:29.123]  She is not African-American.
[03:32:29.183 --> 03:32:32.125]  She is half Indian, at least, and then half black, I believe.
[03:32:32.765 --> 03:32:41.489]  But she is shifting and acting like she is black, like the black community in the United States, saying things in her promotions like, we out here on these streets, they not like us.
[03:32:42.209 --> 03:32:42.870]  Listen, lady.
[03:32:43.470 --> 03:33:08.873]  You've been talking about how you were Indian for years and years and years and years, and now all of a sudden, because it's convenient, because of policies like diversity, equity, and inclusion, because of the influence of Marxism on our higher education institutions and our culture and our businesses, where everyone who feels like maybe these DEI policies are actually harmful and not helpful and more racist is too scared to say anything about it, she is leveraging that and trying to morph in
[03:33:10.376 --> 03:33:16.341]  To this identity, in the context of identity politics, because she knows that it's politically expedient.
[03:33:16.381 --> 03:33:27.731]  She is exploiting race for political gain, which is racist, and that is exactly the type of manifestation one would expect who has paid any attention to what DEI is and has become.
[03:33:27.751 --> 03:33:36.178]  But we still have the likes of Mike Pence in clip number 17 coming out and making statements against Donald Trump, defending himself against Donald Trump.
[03:33:36.298 --> 03:33:36.879]  How is it
[03:33:37.119 --> 03:33:54.004]  That anyone who is on the right, who is actually a patriot of this country, who loves this Constitution, would attack Donald Trump when we know that the alternative is leftist, globalist socialism on the highest levels by the most corrupt and evil people our nation has ever seen.
[03:33:54.044 --> 03:33:54.604]  This is clip number 17.
[03:34:00.014 --> 03:34:03.943]  And then on that day, President Trump asked me to put him over the Constitution.
[03:34:04.224 --> 03:34:05.486]  But I chose the Constitution.
[03:34:06.008 --> 03:34:06.749]  And I always will.
[03:34:07.859 --> 03:34:11.482]  Anyone who puts themselves over the Constitution should never be President of the United States.
[03:34:11.942 --> 03:34:18.187]  And anyone who asks someone else to put themselves over the Constitution should never be President of the United States again.
[03:34:18.227 --> 03:34:25.933]  What the President maintained that day, and frankly has said over and over again over the last two and a half years, is completely false.
[03:34:26.814 --> 03:34:35.020]  I dismissed it out of hand, but sadly the President was surrounded by a group of crackpot lawyers that kept telling him what his itching ears wanted to hear.
[03:34:37.250 --> 03:34:45.297]  You have Mike Pence, for no reason whatsoever, just relentlessly attacking Trump, I guess just to save his own reputation, because now everybody in the Republican Party absolutely hates him.
[03:34:45.337 --> 03:34:51.083]  Everyone who isn't a rhino or a neocon absolutely hates Mike Pence, and he's probably bitter about that fact.
[03:34:52.386 --> 03:35:20.106]  And even if he believed what he said, is this actually the right approach, the right strategy, what's healthiest for our nation to come after and attack Donald Trump, who's just been the victim of an assassination attempt, who's obviously a more honest person than Kamala Harris or Joe Biden, who is actually the one who's taken a bullet for democracy while Kamala Harris has been appointed the Democratic nominee for President of the United States with zero votes from the Democratic voters or party whatsoever.
[03:35:22.102 --> 03:35:24.185]  Is Mike Pence actually doing anything good for America?
[03:35:24.225 --> 03:35:26.588]  Because this next clip here of J.D.
[03:35:26.648 --> 03:35:39.824]  Vance, clip number three, despite the left calling him weird, trying to brand him as weird, trying to lie about what's in his book, saying that he had sex with a couch when he didn't, and then failing to adequately retract that statement, it was too late by the time they admitted it wasn't real.
[03:35:41.266 --> 03:35:47.347]  This is the type of ticket, the type of mentality that Mike Pence and these leftists are fighting against.
[03:35:47.387 --> 03:35:53.948]  These are the type of people and philosophies that the leftists feel like they have to lie about so they can't win.
[03:35:53.968 --> 03:35:55.188]  Now, does this sound so bad to you?
[03:35:55.228 --> 03:35:55.969]  This is clip number three.
[03:35:55.989 --> 03:35:56.949]  It sounded pretty good to me.
[03:35:58.049 --> 03:36:02.710]  My friends, I want the American dream as a goal for our children and for our grandchildren.
[03:36:02.730 --> 03:36:05.970]  You never hear people talk about the American dream anymore.
[03:36:06.970 --> 03:36:09.451]  Four years ago, you did because things were going well.
[03:36:10.720 --> 03:36:18.862]  And it's just as Donald Trump brought it back when he ran for president before and served as president, he's gonna bring it back.
[03:36:18.923 --> 03:36:20.603]  We just gotta send him to the White House, right?
[03:36:25.745 --> 03:36:29.346]  So let's talk a little bit about what we believe in the Republican Party.
[03:36:29.406 --> 03:36:36.788]  We believe that a million cheap knockoff toasters aren't worth the price of a single American manufacturing job.
[03:36:41.061 --> 03:36:50.084]  We believe in rebuilding American factories and rebuilding the American dream and we're going to stamp more and more products with that beautiful label, Made in the USA.
[03:37:07.614 --> 03:37:09.236]  So he's got support, folks.
[03:37:09.556 --> 03:37:10.497]  He's not weird.
[03:37:10.717 --> 03:37:11.799]  He's very rational.
[03:37:12.059 --> 03:37:19.367]  He's walked back and reversed and changed from all the claims or statements that he made that were negative toward President Trump years and years and years ago.
[03:37:19.447 --> 03:37:21.790]  There were a lot of people that had questions about Donald Trump.
[03:37:21.830 --> 03:37:24.573]  Half the party voted for Ted Cruz in 2016.
[03:37:24.613 --> 03:37:25.354]  Nearly half the party.
[03:37:27.409 --> 03:37:30.670]  And so it's not unreasonable to see politicians change.
[03:37:30.690 --> 03:37:36.951]  There's a difference between changing one's perspective and evolving one's perspective, and then just flip-flopping on every single issue like the Democrats do.
[03:37:37.251 --> 03:37:37.831]  I trust J.D.
[03:37:37.871 --> 03:37:38.051]  Vance.
[03:37:38.091 --> 03:37:38.851]  I'm gonna give him a chance.
[03:37:38.911 --> 03:37:39.471]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[03:37:39.811 --> 03:37:47.693]  But I think he is directly in line with the wants, interests, and needs of the American people.
[03:37:47.713 --> 03:37:49.033]  I think he has his finger on the pulse.
[03:37:49.073 --> 03:37:50.694]  He knows what it's like to grow up poor.
[03:37:50.954 --> 03:37:52.834]  He knows what it's like to work your way to the top.
[03:37:54.560 --> 03:38:00.205]  Literally with nothing, getting into Ivy League education, getting into politics, making it onto this ticket.
[03:38:00.545 --> 03:38:07.051]  This is somebody who has not had a life of privilege, despite what the leftists may try to say or lie to you about him.
[03:38:07.391 --> 03:38:09.733]  This is somebody who I believe is a great choice.
[03:38:09.773 --> 03:38:14.157]  I think he's going to help with the Rust Belt vote, and we're going to see who Kamala chooses to run against him.
[03:38:14.177 --> 03:38:20.963]  But why is it that the Democrats, the globalists, the New World Order, whether they're neocons like Mike Pence or Karl Rove,
[03:38:22.475 --> 03:38:27.218]  Or they're the leftists like Kamala Harris and the Obamas and the Clintons and these globalists like Klaus Schwab and others.
[03:38:27.598 --> 03:38:31.380]  Why is it that they hate statements like that?
[03:38:31.681 --> 03:38:33.542]  That they hate perspectives like that?
[03:38:33.742 --> 03:38:36.604]  That they hate claims and efforts made to
[03:38:38.243 --> 03:38:42.226]  Create a renaissance, a rebirth of the American dream, because it's true, folks.
[03:38:42.246 --> 03:38:49.031]  The American dream, by definition, is this idea that you can have your own house and your own family and own it, and then you've made it.
[03:38:49.792 --> 03:38:54.715]  And that has quickly gone away under the Joe Biden administration, where we've seen inflation rampant.
[03:38:55.015 --> 03:38:57.017]  They keep claiming that it's lower than it's been in 50 years.
[03:38:57.057 --> 03:39:03.502]  It's like, oh my gosh, if it's the lowest it's been in your entire administration now, that means it's been worse the whole time?
[03:39:04.284 --> 03:39:06.284]  Nobody can afford to make a down payment on a house.
[03:39:06.324 --> 03:39:20.468]  Nobody can afford to make the mortgage payments on a house now with these rates as high as they are while we fund war after war in nation after nation, all while members of our intelligence community and our military are saying that robots could make up a third of the U.S.
[03:39:20.528 --> 03:39:21.048]  military by 2039.
[03:39:22.108 --> 03:39:33.571]  And now we know that the White House is influencing, enforcing and encouraging and blackmailing big tech companies like Meta and Google and others into mass censorship.
[03:39:34.744 --> 03:39:40.448]  While national security is breached after hackers break into most sensitive U.S.
[03:39:40.488 --> 03:39:47.212]  government files, all while our own government will not respond to any FOIA requests about the assassination attempt at Donald Trump.
[03:39:47.573 --> 03:40:04.424]  I mean, we have a situation now where the enemies of the United States know more because of their hackers about what our government does than our people know about what our government does because they're more carefully protecting their secrets from the eyes and ears of the American people than from the enemies of the United States.
[03:40:05.884 --> 03:40:22.992]  As political campaigns and lobbyists conspire together to regulate artificial intelligence so that it can only be in the hands of a few major corporations and big government entities to ensure that no decentralization of this technology takes place so they can control every aspect of it.
[03:40:23.032 --> 03:40:25.172]  Folks, we are coming up on the end of the show today.
[03:40:25.192 --> 03:40:26.253]  We've got one minute left.
[03:40:26.633 --> 03:40:26.993]  Let's do it!
[03:40:53.200 --> 03:40:56.221]  It's gonna go pretty quick, so please get this as soon as possible.
[03:40:56.241 --> 03:40:57.421]  This is one of my favorite products.
[03:40:57.481 --> 03:41:04.684]  This and our BrainForce Plus or BrainForce Ultra at InfoWarsTore.com, but next-level foundational energy will light you up like a Christmas tree.
[03:41:05.124 --> 03:41:17.368]  And we know that in this InfoWar that we're in, when the New World Order, the globalists, the political class are constantly attacking us on every level, whether they're attacking our Second Amendment rights, our freedom of speech, whether they're attacking InfoWars, our families directly, or Alex Jones directly,
[03:41:17.668 --> 03:41:20.910]  We know it's more important now than ever that we have as much energy as possible.
[03:41:20.950 --> 03:41:25.734]  So get next level foundational energy to combat these evil New World Order globalists.
[03:41:26.414 --> 03:41:28.216]  And it's not just going to help you have more energy, folks.
[03:41:28.256 --> 03:41:32.459]  It's going to keep us on the air when America needs InfoWars more than ever.
[03:41:32.859 --> 03:41:38.563]  So number one, you've got central banks now starting to buy it by the tons, right?
[03:41:38.723 --> 03:41:39.304]  It's a lot.
[03:41:39.964 --> 03:41:46.569]  You've now got Chinese citizens being encouraged to not just buy gold, but buy silver.
[03:41:47.293 --> 03:41:52.295]  Because China and Russia want to destroy the Western banks.
[03:41:52.815 --> 03:42:00.958]  And the Western banks, JPMorgan Chase and HSBC, have the largest number of naked short positions on the planet.
[03:42:01.824 --> 03:42:02.445]  On the planet.
[03:42:02.485 --> 03:42:09.610]  I think between the two of them, they have over 900 million ounces of silver in short position.
[03:42:09.650 --> 03:42:13.212]  Well, only 1.2 billion ounces of silver is mined every year globally.
[03:42:13.232 --> 03:42:17.315]  So they've got almost the entire annual production in a short position.
[03:42:17.855 --> 03:42:24.100]  That means when the price goes up, these banks lose money hand over fist in multiples.
[03:42:24.680 --> 03:42:34.023]  China knows this, which is why they're encouraging all of their citizens now to buy not just gold, but buy silver, because that creates more demand.
[03:42:34.384 --> 03:42:41.026]  Every time silver goes up in price, the Western banks lose money in multiples, because they're on the wrong side of the transaction.
[03:42:41.781 --> 03:42:45.762]  They want to do it to destroy the West, and they want to do it to make a financial gain.
[03:42:46.222 --> 03:42:51.004]  Both of those, in their minds, are legitimate enough reasons to do something, right?
[03:42:51.044 --> 03:42:57.326]  But let's look at silver, because that's what we're allocated into right now, because the ratio between gold and silver points towards silver.
[03:42:57.366 --> 03:42:58.226]  It's outperforming.
[03:42:58.986 --> 03:43:03.187]  Where were we just four years ago?
[03:43:03.207 --> 03:43:03.187]  1191.
[03:43:03.687 --> 03:43:06.188]  But now, since then, we've gone from 1191 to almost 30.
[03:43:09.463 --> 03:43:09.724]  I think?
[03:43:25.387 --> 03:43:35.049]  These unified ledgers and these social credit scoring systems and this digital money, you're getting something tangible that actually doesn't just grow.
[03:43:35.089 --> 03:43:36.029]  It's growing tremendously.
[03:43:36.049 --> 03:43:37.529]  It's up like 40% in four months.
[03:43:37.549 --> 03:43:38.269]  That's amazing.
[03:43:38.729 --> 03:43:41.810]  But you also have something that can maintain your freedoms, Alex.
[03:43:41.850 --> 03:43:46.631]  That's the tangible intangible, which is as our freedom.
[03:43:46.671 --> 03:43:50.791]  I can't believe we have millions of viewers right now and maybe 500 people call you.
[03:43:51.291 --> 03:43:52.032]  It's a sponsor.
[03:43:52.052 --> 03:43:53.652]  I want to promote what I think is great.
[03:43:54.472 --> 03:44:01.033]  So, I sell water filtration systems that have the highest rating for like half the price on average, and I sell high quality supplements.
[03:44:01.133 --> 03:44:02.473]  I just sell stuff that I think is great.
[03:44:03.034 --> 03:44:06.114]  Everybody should call you and get into silver and gold right now.
[03:44:06.494 --> 03:44:08.315]  There's nothing performing as good as it.
[03:44:08.835 --> 03:44:13.696]  I mean, it's like, it's on record it's the best investment, but the stockbrokers won't tell you that.
[03:44:13.896 --> 03:44:17.456]  The globalist argument is, oh, the world's in turmoil, and everything's collapsing.
[03:44:17.476 --> 03:44:21.697]  We've got to be strong, and America's got to threaten Russia and China to keep us as the dollar.
[03:44:22.017 --> 03:44:24.020]  But they're the ones that undermine the currency.
[03:44:24.060 --> 03:44:26.704]  They're the ones that brought us into this situation.
[03:44:27.445 --> 03:44:29.428]  And so that's why this is so incredibly dangerous.
[03:44:29.448 --> 03:44:32.973]  They just tried to kill Trump just, what, 10, 11 days ago.
[03:44:33.374 --> 03:44:35.537]  They are going for broke.
[03:44:35.637 --> 03:44:36.919]  I wish we weren't in this position.
[03:44:37.399 --> 03:44:37.919]  But we are.
[03:44:38.019 --> 03:44:43.780]  But by admitting where we are, we have a real chance of waking up, like Congress saying, we know you tried to kill Trump.
[03:44:44.120 --> 03:44:46.521]  Buying silver is the smartest bet there is.
[03:44:46.541 --> 03:44:48.881]  If you'd have bought silver a year ago, up 20, 30%.
[03:44:49.662 --> 03:44:51.722]  That's what you want.
[03:44:51.862 --> 03:44:54.843]  And silver is the big mover in this economy.
[03:44:55.143 --> 03:44:59.023]  So, go now to KEPM.com forward slash gold, or 720-605-300.
[03:44:59.063 --> 03:45:02.384]  We'll explain it all to you.
[03:45:02.444 --> 03:45:05.545]  Most of the gold and silver companies are charging you huge 30, 40, 50% premiums
[03:45:07.485 --> 03:45:09.487]  And most of the conservative talk show hosts are doing it too.
[03:45:09.787 --> 03:45:11.749]  And I talked to a person, I said, you need Kirk Elliott.
[03:45:12.129 --> 03:45:15.632]  What does Goldman Sachs think gold is going to do before the end of the year?
[03:45:15.652 --> 03:45:17.353]  $2,700 an ounce.
[03:45:17.613 --> 03:45:24.198]  And I'm sitting here saying, it funds us, it keeps us on air, and it's the best investment hands down in an imperfect world.
[03:45:24.238 --> 03:45:29.342]  I mean, this is, to me, is one of the most important things to protect your financial future ever.
[03:45:29.503 --> 03:45:32.405]  Go now to KEPM.com forward slash gold.
