[00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.969]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.689]  Visit Infowars.com forward slash show and support the Infowars.
[00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:36.200]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:38.850]  Yeah, look, there he is.
[00:00:41.570 --> 00:01:00.750]  And look what happened to our country.
[00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.270]  Probably 20 million people.
[00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.829]  And you know, that's a little bit old, that joke.
[00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:34.689]  We're good to go.
[00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:56.939]  ABC News, CBS News, CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, Washington Post, they all told you Hillary had from a 95% to a 99% chance of winning, that she was 20 points ahead in all the polls, and it was all a lie.
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.019]  Those polls are to convince you to give up.
[00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.719]  They're a fraud. They couldn't assassinate Trump.
[00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:11.409]  Their attempt failed, and so now they're trying to assassinate him politically by convincing you that voting for him is a failure.
[00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:12.770]  Don't buy the propaganda.
[00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.150]  Don't buy the gaslighting.
[00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.930]  Your consortium has put out a projection of a 99% chance of winning.
[00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.180]  Is that correct? Yeah.
[00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:29.360]  We should be careful about probabilities as high, because once the probability gets that high, it's not so clear that it matters whether it's 91%, 95%, or 99%.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.439]  But yes, that's right. The probability is high enough that my site is reporting it is currently above 99%.
[00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:56.860]  And of course, as I predicted months ago, Eighty-something days from the election, they declare a global health emergency, and instead of calling it monkeypox, which didn't work last year, now it's mpox, and we need the UN treaty and world government and the UN's openly talking about their spokespersons sending UN troops into Western countries to make us stay locked down.
[00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.939]  The globalists are desperate.
[00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.520]  The world is turning against them.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.919]  We just have to keep exposing them and not give up, and we will win.
[00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:16.990]  Today, the emergency committee met and advised me that, in its view, the situation constitutes a public emergency of international concern.
[00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.150]  I have accepted that advice.
[00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:38.189]  The detection and rapid spread of a new clade of MPOX in Eastern DRC, its detection in neighboring countries that had not previously reported MPOX, and the potential for further spread within Africa and beyond is very worrying.
[00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:52.969]  In addition to other outbreaks of other clades of MPOCs in other parts of Africa, it's clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives.
[00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.229]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are coming up on a very historic moment in history.
[00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.009]  President Donald Trump is back in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:09.349]  A month ago, on July 5th.
[00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:14.689]  The place where his first assassination attempt took place, the first one certainly that we know of.
[00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.269]  And this is all in the context of this massive hurricane that has swept...
[00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.990]  We've got Nick Sordor on the ground at Butler, Pennsylvania, joining us via Skype for just a couple of minutes.
[00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:31.149]  I know that we had some trouble getting him connected, but we're so glad that he was able to take some time to speak with us.
[00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.290]  He is an American hero.
[00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:39.089]  The work that he's done with this Hurricane Helene response that he's done more than FEMA, quite frankly.
[00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.310]  He's done more despite FEMA, quite frankly.
[00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.029]  Nick, it's an honor and a pleasure to have you with us.
[00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.779]  How's everything going in Butler? Everything so far so good here in Butler Chase.
[00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:50.579]  I'm in the back now.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:59.879]  It took me probably five minutes to walk all the way from the front, which you see way over there, back to the back here, just so that I could do this with you.
[00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:02.759]  And I'm telling you, there's got to be 100,000 people here.
[00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:05.279]  I have never seen anything like this.
[00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:06.779]  It's like the Super Bowl out here.
[00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:13.180]  It's wild. You have people doing tailgate-style stuff out here in the overflow area.
[00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:15.939]  Brought blankets and food laying on the ground.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.779]  I mean, it's a hell of an environment.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.339]  There's so much, you know, it's really a testament to how much these people love Trump, love our country.
[00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:33.579]  And I'm really proud to be able to be here, especially after, you know, seeing what I saw in North Carolina this past week.
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.879]  And, you know, the American spirit is here.
[00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:39.620]  I mean, we have potential.
[00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:47.589]  It's just, you know, Kamala and Biden are absolutely crushing it in the worst way possible, ruining lives out there in places like that.
[00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:49.529]  We have hope, and this gives me hope, Chase.
[00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:54.449]  Yeah, absolutely. So my understanding is that people started showing up this morning.
[00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:56.149]  Have there been speakers all throughout the day?
[00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.870]  And I understand that Trump is going to speak in about 55 minutes or so if he's on time.
[00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.519]  Is that right? Yeah, absolutely.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.360]  So, Jake, people were sleeping here overnight to get a front row spot.
[00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:09.240]  I mean, that's very common for Trump rallies.
[00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.240]  It was just, you know, on an even bigger scale last night because people knew that this was going to be huge.
[00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.579]  They knew that there were going to be tens of thousands.
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:21.240]  I don't know if anybody guessed that there were going to be 100,000 people in here, and they're still funneling in.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.139]  And, you know, the security presence is noticeably higher.
[00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:31.379]  It's really weird that that sloped roof is no longer as sloped as it was before, I guess, because nobody has fallen off.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.680]  Wow. And so it's at the exact same venue.
[00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:37.560]  It's not Justin Butler. I mean, this is literally the same spot.
[00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:42.839]  Same venue, same, the stage is in the same spot.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.300]  And the setup, I was talking to BrickSuit, if you guys know who he is.
[00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:53.360]  BrickSuit was in the front row when President Trump was shot last time.
[00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:55.939]  He's in the same spot that he was last time, the same chair.
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.660]  So the setup is virtually the same.
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.420]  Wow. That must have been a nightmare.
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.459]  I imagine that Secret Service was like, Trump, you can't do it exactly the same way because then the public will know all the details.
[00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:10.699]  And he's just like, no, we're doing it exactly the same way, huh?
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.399]  Trump is Trump, though. You're not going to stop him.
[00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:17.160]  So do you feel safe or are you worried about it?
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.779]  Is there any anxiety kind of in the back of your mind?
[00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:19.839]  God forbid something should happen.
[00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:25.379]  No, really. In reality, no.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.779]  I mean, it doesn't seem like anybody.
[00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:29.399]  I was expecting people here to be, like, on their toes.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.259]  And there was a point in time where somebody needed a medic, and so somebody else started screaming.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.660]  Nobody jumped or anything.
[00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:43.839]  They just were concerned. But I would have thought, you know, if somebody were to start screaming and everybody, you know, around them screaming and waving their hands and stuff, that people would get...
[00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:46.730]  Get nervous about something that could possibly happen.
[00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.050]  But it seems like the people out here are resilient.
[00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.910]  They didn't jump. There doesn't seem to be any sense of anxiety.
[00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.370]  And I love that.
[00:07:54.629 --> 00:08:02.670]  I love that. It kind of shows these evil people that are trying to take you, me, President Trump out even physically.
[00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.689]  Even with them, we're still not deterred.
[00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:07.490]  And that's a beautiful thing.
[00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.290]  Have you heard from Elon Musk yet today?
[00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.110]  Has he spoken yet? No, he has not spoken yet.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.899]  I do know that he is here.
[00:08:18.939 --> 00:08:34.940]  What I'm hoping is that he's going to be pulled up on stage by President Trump, especially after everything that they've done together for North Carolina, getting us all these Starlinks that we set up and deployed all over North Carolina.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:42.980]  It just shows when those two work together, especially when they get into the White House, things can change on a grand scale.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:51.779]  It was him and Trump, Elon and Trump, that were able to get those Starlinks deployed to North Carolina practically overnight.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.039]  Hey, that's Cliff Maloney, American hero, P.A. Chase.
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.460]  That's Cliff Maloney. He was just on the network.
[00:09:00.059 --> 00:09:01.120]  Oh my gosh, Chase.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.960]  I'm out here doing the large work.
[00:09:03.799 --> 00:09:05.580]  I'm telling you, man, what do we got, 31 days?
[00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:07.980]  About one month. I've lost out.
[00:09:08.139 --> 00:09:09.600]  Almost exactly a month. You're the one that's supposed to know.
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.539]  Yeah, today's the 5th, so the election's on November 5th.
[00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:17.299]  It's got to be 30 days. It's good to see Cliff there, man.
[00:09:17.419 --> 00:09:21.519]  And it's funny when you go to these events, how many people know each other and bump into people that they know.
[00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:23.019]  It's always inspiring to see that.
[00:09:23.399 --> 00:09:26.460]  It's like a big family coming together for a reunion at so many of these events.
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.419]  But I do want to talk to you a little bit about, before I let you go, Nick, I know that you're busy, obviously.
[00:09:30.539 --> 00:09:32.600]  I want to talk to you a little bit about what you witnessed.
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:43.419]  Regarding the hurricane response, we've heard a lot of conflicting reports from the government versus from people like Elon Musk, who we tend to trust more than the government, people like you who we tend to trust more than the government.
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.879]  What is going on?
[00:09:45.039 --> 00:09:48.600]  What happened? How is it similar and different than what happened to Lahaina?
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.340]  And what do you think the impacts ultimately going to be on this election?
[00:09:54.570 --> 00:10:01.190]  Well, you know, so there are, and I tried not to relate it to what happened in Maui right away.
[00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:13.870]  I waited several days to make that comparison, and then I went ahead and decided, You know, look, based on everything that I've seen, it's almost like Maui all over again.
[00:10:14.169 --> 00:10:15.309]  And I hate to say that.
[00:10:15.629 --> 00:10:17.830]  I was hoping that that would never happen again.
[00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:33.929]  But especially from the level of a cover-up that it is, they are desperately trying to cover this up because it is so close to an election, and they don't want to show how incompetent Or even, you know, if you want to go as far to say corrupt as they are, they wanted you to forget about it.
[00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.509]  If you notice, nobody was saying anything about it.
[00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.970]  Nobody was talking about it. The media wasn't talking about it.
[00:10:39.049 --> 00:10:40.570]  You didn't hear anything from Biden or...
[00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:44.690]  Even Biden said, I didn't know what storm you were talking about the other day when he was approached about it.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.799]  Yeah. And, you know, it took him days to approve a disaster declaration.
[00:10:50.179 --> 00:10:52.379]  You know, I had been there up until one.
[00:10:52.539 --> 00:10:57.139]  I got I got here to Pennsylvania about one thirty this morning and I'll be back in North Carolina again.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.759]  But in an entire time that I was out there, I didn't see.
[00:11:01.299 --> 00:11:07.120]  I mean, I could count on one hand how many feds that I saw there, how many federal relief workers were.
[00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:10.299]  You know, I didn't see any FEMA people until yesterday.
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.480]  And even then I saw like two or three.
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:16.919]  Now, was it true that they were restricting the airspace and not allowing people to deliver supplies?
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.639]  Absolutely. They were trying to...
[00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:22.240]  Well, they were blockading the roads.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.940]  That's one thing that I know for sure because I experienced it.
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.740]  Luckily, North Carolina State Police, they weren't having that.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.860]  It almost got a little ugly, we'll say, because the FEMA doesn't have any sort of jurisdiction to be blocking roads.
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.799]  Why were they doing that? You know, the state police weren't having it.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.240]  I'm very grateful for them, for all their help.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.259]  We wouldn't have been able to do what we do without the state police.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.659]  But the feds were literally just trying to get in the way.
[00:11:47.779 --> 00:12:00.539]  That's when you said at the beginning of the show here, you said, doing what I was doing despite FEMA. That's exactly what it is, because FEMA is literally just there to get in the way for whatever reason.
[00:12:01.019 --> 00:12:03.009]  I don't know. Wow, it's unbelievable.
[00:12:03.309 --> 00:12:05.250]  Now, do you think this is going to be another land-grab thing?
[00:12:05.289 --> 00:12:11.429]  I've heard rumors and TikTok videos and conspiracies about lithium being abundant in the region.
[00:12:11.629 --> 00:12:19.409]  Do you think it has anything to do with that, or is that people just kind of grasping straws trying to put together, rationalize what would otherwise be considered just massive incompetence?
[00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:24.669]  I think that, I mean, the lithium deposit, that is true.
[00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:27.450]  I don't have any solid...
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.500]  Evidence to say that it is a land grab.
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.419]  But it could very quickly turn into that.
[00:12:34.679 --> 00:12:41.139]  I don't see them making any moves on that until after the media attention goes away, which is why we have to make sure it doesn't go away.
[00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:43.580]  That's when they try to pull those stunts.
[00:12:45.419 --> 00:12:47.419]  And you asked a little bit earlier about the election.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:13:01.879]  You could almost say that they're slow walking these relief efforts out there because it's going to make it impossible for people in deep red Western North Carolina to actually vote, to actually pass their ballots.
[00:13:02.179 --> 00:13:03.299]  Many of them have been displaced.
[00:13:03.539 --> 00:13:05.340]  They don't have any mailing addresses anymore.
[00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:11.080]  They can't just, you know, ship their ballots anywhere and get it and mail it back in.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:18.480]  That's just not how it works. So there are going to be tens of thousands of displaced people that aren't going to be able to vote now that this is going on.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:30.220]  So it's in their best interest to make sure that it's slow walk because if they flip North Carolina because of an artificial reason like this, you know, it's going to create a lot of problems for Trump's path to 270.
[00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:36.590]  Wow. Well, Nick, I'm going to let you get back to the rally and enjoy your time there and mingle and walk around and experience it.
[00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:43.210]  Before I let you go, any final thoughts for the listeners about what you're seeing in Butler or the hurricane or anything else that you'd like to leave us with?
[00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:50.649]  Yeah. Take everything that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris say and believe exactly the opposite.
[00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.129]  That's it. That's all I can tell you. That's the best advice I have for you.
[00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:57.429]  And then in terms of the rally, I'm telling you guys, you've got 30-something days.
[00:13:57.529 --> 00:14:00.730]  If Trump is coming to you somewhere nearby, you've got to get to one of these rallies.
[00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:03.669]  It is like an all-day party, is what it is.
[00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.190]  It is fantastic. Every part of it is amazing.
[00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.190]  They always have great speakers. Make sure you get out.
[00:14:08.789 --> 00:14:09.870]  And really appreciate you, Chase.
[00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:11.700]  Thank you for having me on, man. God bless you, Nick.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.620]  Stay safe out there. Enjoy your time.
[00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:19.799]  We'll be covering this for the remainder of the time that it's going on, basically until Donald Trump is finished speaking.
[00:14:19.899 --> 00:14:22.779]  I am going to go to clip number two here in a second when the crew is ready.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.679]  Helene could swing the election, Politico says, the quiet part out loud.
[00:14:26.779 --> 00:14:36.909]  So we just heard from Nick's order that This is going to have a negative impact on many voters being displaced, unable to vote in this election on November 5th.
[00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:39.629]  And many of them we know are Trump supporters, conservative voters.
[00:14:39.809 --> 00:14:49.570]  Some of the footage that came out, some of the earliest footage that we saw come out from this disaster was people putting Trump signs back in their yards after the flooding had gone away.
[00:14:50.009 --> 00:14:59.470]  Even David Axelrod, one of the most famous Democratic campaign consultants and strategists Of all time has come out and admitted that this is going to have a negative impact on the Trump campaign.
[00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.789]  Let's run clip number two here and unpack it on the other side.
[00:15:03.049 --> 00:15:17.950]  Sure, a bunch of these folks who've had their homes and lives destroyed elsewhere in western North Carolina in the mountains there are going to be as easy to wrangle for the Trump campaign.
[00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:22.830]  And I'm not just going to criticize Democrats for the response to this.
[00:15:23.129 --> 00:15:27.710]  Krasenstein earlier today was criticizing Republicans as if Republicans are so much better than Democrats.
[00:15:27.889 --> 00:15:31.789]  And I just told him, I said, look, this isn't 2012 anymore, Krasenstein.
[00:15:32.149 --> 00:15:34.730]  Nobody is saying that Republicans are good.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.360]  Okay, it's not about Republicans versus Democrats.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.320]  It's about the people versus the political class.
[00:15:40.419 --> 00:15:43.120]  And in clip number nine, I'll show you exactly what I mean.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:49.399]  This is Senator Lindsey Graham pivoting away from this hurricane disaster to the needs of Israel for some reason.
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.519]  And I'm not somebody who's for or against Israel.
[00:15:52.759 --> 00:15:54.759]  I simply am America first.
[00:15:55.059 --> 00:16:04.480]  And so when I see my leaders say something like this, it just goes to prove and reinforce the political philosophy that these people are against us and they have their own political interests.
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:10.240]  This is clip number nine. You can thank Donald Trump and Elon Musk for that.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.639]  You know, I've been going all over South Carolina.
[00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:16.340]  Like most people, I haven't slept much.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.980]  But look what's going on in Israel.
[00:16:18.179 --> 00:16:22.039]  Our friends in Israel are surrounded by people that want to kill them, destroy them.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.740]  A second holocaust in the making.
[00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:25.679]  And Biden says, be proportional.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.379]  What is the proportional response to people who want to kill you and your family?
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.659]  They're running out of ammunition in Israel.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.360]  We have to help our friends to keep the war over there from coming here.
[00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:38.600]  They're willing to.
[00:16:38.679 --> 00:16:40.799]  Again, just war hungry for no reason.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.179]  Why is it?
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:49.379]  And we see people on the left say, hey, it's not that money was diverted away from disaster relief to migrants.
[00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:54.419]  This was the budget that was approved by Republicans and Democrats for disaster relief this year.
[00:16:54.519 --> 00:16:56.360]  So they've maxed out the budget that was approved.
[00:16:56.419 --> 00:16:58.039]  It's not because we overspent on migrants.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:19.549]  The question is then, why did our Congress approve so much more money, millions upon millions of more dollars, For the migrant crisis, without solving the problem whatsoever, they just sponsor the invasion of our own country without approving enough money for things like disaster relief right here in the United States of America.
[00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.049]  It's absolutely disgusting to me.
[00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:34.170]  And they come out and they say, we saw Kamala Harris come out in a $62,000 Tiffany necklace and announce the $750 that they're going to give for emergency relief for necessary goods and services to people immediately in the area.
[00:17:34.359 --> 00:17:40.500]  Now we're seeing that hundreds upon hundreds of people who are applying for that funding are being denied.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.740]  This is clip number 32 I want to run here.
[00:17:42.779 --> 00:17:44.039]  It's just a few minutes long.
[00:17:44.339 --> 00:17:50.099]  This is a victim who was denied the $750 because he had homeowner's insurance.
[00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:59.859]  Let's watch. I just saw the video of Kamala Harris in my hometown, Augusta, Georgia, speaking to people like everything's going to be okay.
[00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:03.970]  She's sitting here telling us that go online, apply.
[00:18:04.349 --> 00:18:07.150]  Well, okay. A, hundreds of us still don't have power.
[00:18:07.369 --> 00:18:09.869]  Internet services. Sure, we can get to it.
[00:18:10.009 --> 00:18:11.730]  We can fight. We can apply.
[00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:13.990]  We can get on it for immediate assistance.
[00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.410]  Well, I went on because we split.
[00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.509]  We went to Columbia right away.
[00:18:19.859 --> 00:18:20.880]  And got our hotel room.
[00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:23.539]  Now, luckily, we're in an Airbnb.
[00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:25.420]  This is a place that we get to live.
[00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:34.960]  I get to give my kids some hot water, some power, some food, just some comfort, something to help them know that this is going to be okay while our house is back home destroyed and filling up with water.
[00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:36.859]  The floors are caving in.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.539]  Hundreds of people. That's happening to everybody around the city.
[00:18:40.079 --> 00:18:41.579]  Like I said, we still don't have water.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:50.470]  We still don't have power. Slowly it's getting restored and I think all the linemen that are out there working so hard from all the other states, they're the only ones that are actually getting things done, not the freaking government.
[00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:58.109]  Because you're telling us to go online to FEMA and apply and you'll get immediate help for $750.
[00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:02.289]  Well, okay, I went on FEMA, I applied and I immediately got denied.
[00:19:02.539 --> 00:19:30.289]  Because apparently I have homeowners insurance and that's gonna cover that and okay sure I know it will it'll get taken care of thank God we're all safe and alive I know it's just things it's a house but it's not immediate and I don't know what is she talking about I have no idea nobody I know has had immediate assistance nobody's $750 what to our cash app what are you gonna get how are we gonna do this how are we gonna get this so then if we get the 750 That'll barely cover the groceries that we've all lost in our freezers and refrigerators and everything.
[00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:38.269]  Also, there's thousands of pine trees just like this one and oak trees and all these trees all over the entire city.
[00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:39.970]  Power lines are everywhere.
[00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:41.930]  They're ripped apart. Poles are down.
[00:19:42.069 --> 00:19:45.789]  Transformers are down. It's going to take weeks to get this repaired in some places.
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.619]  People are going around. There's tree people that are going around, riding through neighborhoods.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.480]  Hey, hey, hey, you guys need help?
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.019]  Come on. Some of them are trying to get you to sign a contract right there on the spot.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.799]  No quote, no money down.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.799]  We're just going to get to work. Okay, so then a lot of times you have to bring in a crane.
[00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.660]  There's trees on all these houses.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.480]  So now we have to get a crane to pick up the tree.
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.799]  Okay, the crane rents $3,500.
[00:20:10.539 --> 00:20:15.259]  Awesome. And then the groundwork is, I was told, $150 per hour, $185 per hour.
[00:20:15.599 --> 00:20:16.700]  Just until the work's done.
[00:20:16.819 --> 00:20:23.380]  And you just have to trust this, that it's gonna get done, and you have to pay out of pocket, and then your insurance will cover it, and they'll cut you a check.
[00:20:24.119 --> 00:20:28.000]  So $750, man, that's gonna like, that'll definitely take care of it.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:35.339]  I don't know what... It's just, I don't know what I want her to do, but just that was flat out insulting.
[00:20:35.559 --> 00:20:39.460]  And she just didn't seem to have any regard, any care for what was going on.
[00:20:39.599 --> 00:20:46.740]  They flew her in to our literal airport, drove her right to a disaster place, set her up a little podium with, oh, look at this house with trees in it.
[00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:48.259]  This looks awesome. Let's do this.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.940]  Man, I bet you shouldn't spend 10 minutes traveling around looking at that place.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.220]  I have no idea.
[00:20:53.559 --> 00:20:54.880]  But it's just, it's so...
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.539]  And I know we don't even have it as bad.
[00:20:57.759 --> 00:21:07.940]  We have deaths in our area, but compared to people in North Carolina who are absolutely trapped and the entire town's gone, this thing completely obliterated the Southeast.
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.480]  And I don't know.
[00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.309]  What to even do to fix it?
[00:21:12.349 --> 00:21:13.609]  I don't have answers. I don't know.
[00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:20.690]  But I know that her coming on and saying, immediate help, $750 is going to be given to those.
[00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:23.009]  What the hell is that?
[00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:25.950]  What? What are we supposed to do with that?
[00:21:26.109 --> 00:21:27.329]  And what immediate help?
[00:21:27.509 --> 00:21:28.569]  What are you talking about?
[00:21:29.309 --> 00:21:31.829]  People are going knocking door to door, who has power, who has don't.
[00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:34.170]  I mean, it's pretty easy to tell who can have power and who doesn't.
[00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.470]  It's just... And then what are you going to do?
[00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.309]  You're going to give them $750 right there at the door?
[00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:41.069]  Is that what's happening?
[00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:44.690]  Or is it going to be, sit tight, we're coming, here's some cheese and some bread?
[00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:47.490]  Oh God. I don't know guys.
[00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:49.950]  This is just... It's crazy though.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.039]  That it's unreal to go through something like this.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:59.579]  And you see it all your life on news in Florida and Texas and Louisiana.
[00:21:59.779 --> 00:22:01.019]  Everybody get pelts by hurricanes.
[00:22:01.579 --> 00:22:02.940]  We're up in Augusta, Georgia.
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.059]  We get rain, we get wind, sometimes tornadoes.
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.880]  It's never really like a huge deal.
[00:22:08.019 --> 00:22:12.339]  But this swept through and completely decimated our area.
[00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:14.519]  We are not used to anything like this.
[00:22:14.619 --> 00:22:17.720]  Not prepared. We have no idea how to even start setting up.
[00:22:17.839 --> 00:22:21.720]  And we have I don't even know how to start cleaning up trees out of my yard.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.339]  I mean, I guess I'll just get a chainsaw.
[00:22:23.599 --> 00:22:27.539]  But now we have, like, gigantic 20-foot root balls hanging out everywhere.
[00:22:27.799 --> 00:22:39.380]  I can't grind that up. So we have seen this from the left on countless occasions, specifically from the Biden regime and the Kamala Harris campaign, where they promise that they're going to give some relief.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.200]  And then when you look at the details of how that relief looks, it's just so ridiculous and asinine the way that it's dispersed.
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:55.839]  So obviously, when you have her coming out in her $62,000 Tiffany necklace and saying that she's going to be giving disaster relief to the tune of $750 to anybody affected...
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:00.160]  The first thing that comes to your mind is, oh, that's $50 more than what happened in Lahaina.
[00:23:00.539 --> 00:23:13.599]  That's a joke. That amount of relief is sick when we know that migrants in Springfield, Ohio are getting up to $3,000 a month in prepaid debit cards to help them live in our country free of charge, actually sponsoring them to live here.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:40.299]  The people who live there.
[00:23:41.549 --> 00:23:42.769]  They don't want to help them.
[00:23:42.829 --> 00:23:45.410]  They want this disaster to go through the next four weeks.
[00:23:45.509 --> 00:23:52.970]  They don't want people living in their neighborhoods, in their homes, able to vote, able to show up and actually vote because they're trying to swing this election.
[00:23:53.309 --> 00:23:58.589]  Now, I'm going to get into a little bit of speculation about this, and then obviously we're keeping our eye on everything that's happening at this rally.
[00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:01.809]  We're going to be going to it as soon as Trump speaks or if Elon Musk is going to speak.
[00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.269]  We're definitely going to be popping in, so please stay tuned.
[00:24:04.309 --> 00:24:06.609]  But I want to show you what some are thinking.
[00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:13.910]  This is... Clip number five, a brilliant analysis of weather weapons from this woman in a TikTok-style video.
[00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:15.369]  I'm not sure if it was posted on TikTok or not.
[00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.509]  I saw it on X, of course, because that's where I spend all my time.
[00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.750]  But let's watch clip number five and unpack it on the other side.
[00:24:25.109 --> 00:24:26.950]  Now, where have we seen this before?
[00:24:28.049 --> 00:24:32.970]  Lahaina, anyone? What did we come to find out was happening in Lahaina?
[00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.650]  A land grab, right?
[00:24:37.069 --> 00:24:39.849]  What did we come to discover about the Appalachian Mountains?
[00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:49.150]  Lithium deposits, quartz deposits, and the townspeople saying they didn't want the corporations moving in.
[00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:58.549]  That's funny because now it's considered a natural disaster area, which means the federal government can come in and do whatever they want.
[00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.829]  You don't want us to move our corporations in?
[00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:14.210]  If you don't realize by now that they actually do have full control over the weather and what it does, it's time to wake up.
[00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:16.190]  It's time.
[00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:23.609]  As if when this happened to Lahaina last time wasn't soon enough to be awake to this reality.
[00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:28.869]  Earth, air, fire, water.
[00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:32.089]  We're going to pull away from this for a moment because J.D. Vance is going on stage.
[00:25:32.289 --> 00:25:34.650]  I want you to have an opportunity to see his entrance and to see him speak.
[00:25:34.849 --> 00:25:36.829]  So we'll show you more about this on the other side.
[00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:41.509]  But let's go straight to Vance coming up on stage at this historic rally in Butler, Pennsylvania right now, please.
[00:25:46.069 --> 00:25:51.529]  All over the world, but let's rebuild America first.
[00:25:56.059 --> 00:25:57.880]  Stepping away from the bulletproof glass, apparently.
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:35.859]  Wow! What an amazing,
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.140]  amazing crowd.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.539]  What an amazing day.
[00:26:39.059 --> 00:26:48.339]  And my friends, in 31 days, this state, starting with Butler, is going to turn red and we're going to send Donald Trump back to the White House.
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.660]  I'm so proud on this historic day to welcome President Trump.
[00:26:59.799 --> 00:27:01.259]  I know he's en route right now.
[00:27:01.359 --> 00:27:03.859]  He should be here in about, I don't know, a half an hour or so.
[00:27:04.059 --> 00:27:12.089]  But it is... This community, this community has been so good to me and President Trump.
[00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:16.130]  This community is so strong and so resilient.
[00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:25.109]  And my friends, we are so proud to stand here in Butler, Pennsylvania, ready to take back the White House, ready to take back this country.
[00:27:31.849 --> 00:27:40.480]  Now, 84 days ago, of course, On this very field, an assassin tried to fill our hearts with terror.
[00:27:41.779 --> 00:27:45.700]  But we're here to say we can't be intimidated.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.619]  We cannot be stopped.
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.119]  We won't be denied.
[00:27:49.339 --> 00:27:52.619]  We will make America great again, and we're going to do it together.
[00:28:12.119 --> 00:28:19.200]  Now, my friends, I know you'll join me in saying we're going to remember July 13th, 2024, forever.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:27.700]  Many of you were here, and it is a testament to your courage and your patriotism that you're here again today.
[00:28:33.759 --> 00:28:35.559]  Now, you heard the shots.
[00:28:36.259 --> 00:28:38.099]  You saw the blood.
[00:28:38.859 --> 00:28:41.240]  We all feared the worst.
[00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:49.250]  But you knew everything would be okay when President Trump raised his fist high in the air and shouted...
[00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:50.549]  Fight!
[00:28:51.069 --> 00:28:52.289]  Fight! Fight!
[00:28:55.009 --> 00:28:56.609]  Fight! Fight!
[00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:58.549]  Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
[00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.190]  Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
[00:29:00.529 --> 00:29:01.869]  Fight! [...]
[00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:13.640]  Fight! [...] America felt the truth of Scripture.
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:20.220]  Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:31.779]  I truly believe that God saved President Trump's life that day.
[00:29:34.289 --> 00:29:41.410]  And I believe that God is with us right now and watches over this incredible nation every single day.
[00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:52.910]  Now, there are so many people here, so many people we're honored to have, it would be impossible to name all of them.
[00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:54.910]  I see the great Sean Parnell over here.
[00:29:55.009 --> 00:29:56.450]  Sean, you're a hero, man.
[00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:57.589]  You were here on that day.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:05.420]  We're joined by many first responders, elected officials, and other distinguished guests.
[00:30:06.099 --> 00:30:14.660]  And as we gather on these grounds, once again, my friends, we especially thank God for the two great Americans who were wounded and survived in July.
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.099]  That's David Dutch and James Copenhaver.
[00:30:17.319 --> 00:30:31.140]  God bless you guys. Now we pray for their full and complete recoveries and we're honored that David and his family were able to join us today.
[00:30:31.299 --> 00:30:32.940]  Let's give a round of applause to David.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.299]  God bless you and God bless your family.
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:51.779]  But our hearts are heavy with sadness knowing that there's one hero Who's not here with us today?
[00:30:52.119 --> 00:30:54.480]  And that's, of course, the great Cory Coppertory.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.099]  Cory! Cory!
[00:31:03.259 --> 00:31:04.279]  Cory! Cory!
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.000]  Cory! Cory!
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.279]  Cory! Cory! Cory!
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:13.519]  Cory! We're never gonna forget Cory.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.400]  We're never gonna forget his heroism that day.
[00:31:17.069 --> 00:31:25.109]  And I want everyone to join me right now in sending our support, our respect, our love to the Comparatory family here with us today.
[00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:26.390]  We love you guys.
[00:31:26.569 --> 00:31:27.990]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:31.369]  Thank you for loving this country, and thank you for not giving up on it.
[00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:51.099]  Now, After the heartache of that day, our nation hoped to turn a page.
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:32:00.539]  We hoped that our opponents would remember that before we are Democrats or before we are Republicans, we are Americans.
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:12.460]  But sadly, our opponents have not heeded Abraham Lincoln's words and listened to the better angels of our nature.
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:21.579]  Even after That terrible assassination attempt that took one man's life and nearly took many others.
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:26.240]  They continue to use dangerous inflammatory rhetoric.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:35.400]  The media has continued to call Donald Trump, the guy who actually won his primary, a threat to democracy.
[00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:47.009]  A Democrat senator called Donald Trump an existential threat to our democracy.
[00:32:50.769 --> 00:32:55.990]  Kamala Harris said that he was attacking, quote, the foundations of our democracy.
[00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:06.769]  And I think you all will join me in saying to Kamala Harris, how dare you talk about threats to democracy?
[00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:09.049]  Donald Trump took a bullet for democracy.
[00:33:09.309 --> 00:33:10.509]  What the hell have you done?
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:41.180]  The truth is that Kamala Harris and her allies, they attack Donald Trump in order to silence us, we the people.
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:47.619]  They have declared war explicitly on the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
[00:33:48.859 --> 00:33:56.500]  Kamala Harris proudly says she wants to censor the Internet, and Tim Wall said there is no guarantee to free speech.
[00:33:56.619 --> 00:34:07.519]  What do we think about that? But we all know, my friends, we all know that censorship is only the first step.
[00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:10.579]  Just look at everything they've done to President Trump.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.320]  First, they tried to silence him.
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.280]  When that didn't work, they tried to bankrupt him.
[00:34:17.059 --> 00:34:19.099]  When that didn't work, they tried to jail him.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:26.280]  And with all the hatred they have spewed at President Trump, it was only a matter of time before somebody tried to kill him.
[00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:32.559]  And that's exactly what happened not just here in Butler, Pennsylvania, but just a few weeks later in Florida.
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:45.559]  Three weeks ago, while these guys still go out there and attacking him as a threat to democracy, another gunman armed with an AK-47 style rifle tried to finish the job.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:57.820]  In fact, before the gunman in Florida tried to kill Donald Trump, he wrote, quote, democracy is on the ballot.
[00:34:58.079 --> 00:35:06.800]  The exact same words that Kamala Harris wrote after accusing Trump of being a dictator only days before the first attempt on his life.
[00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:36.619]  But for all of those watching at home, and for all those who might be undecided in this crowd, though there probably aren't that many undecided voters in this crowd, I wanna say,
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:37.920]  you know what's so incredible?
[00:35:38.199 --> 00:35:39.420]  You know what's so incredible?
[00:35:39.619 --> 00:35:42.699]  It's how Donald Trump responded to all of this.
[00:35:43.159 --> 00:35:49.719]  Because despite being shot here in Butler, President Trump immediately called for national unity.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.300]  And I'll never forget, my friends, what he told me after the second assassination attempt.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:04.119]  He was probably the first person that he called that Sunday, and I was sitting at home with my son in Cincinnati, and he said, J.D., they tried to do it again.
[00:36:04.219 --> 00:36:05.440]  I said, they tried to do what, sir?
[00:36:06.079 --> 00:36:07.860]  He said, they tried to shoot me again.
[00:36:08.539 --> 00:36:10.300]  And at first, I was in disbelief.
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:14.079]  I did, I think, immediately my thoughts went to him and how he was doing.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:18.960]  Of course, he was physically okay because he was calling me, but I said, sir, are you doing okay?
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:23.960]  And of course, President Trump and his President Trump ways said, yeah, I'm doing fine.
[00:36:24.099 --> 00:36:29.260]  You know, I'm a little pissed off because I was about to make a dirt birdie on the sixth hole and they wouldn't let me finish.
[00:36:38.019 --> 00:36:43.420]  But it made me think. It made me think about the leadership qualities we wanted a President of the United States.
[00:36:43.579 --> 00:36:50.079]  And so I'd like to ask you, who would you rather have facing down, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping?
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:58.179]  Someone? Someone who is afraid of interviews with the friendly American media?
[00:36:59.239 --> 00:37:06.019]  Or someone who faces down two assassins and returns triumphantly to the very place that he got shot?
[00:37:20.869 --> 00:37:25.030]  Now, some of you may have seen that I had a little debate with Governor Walz a few days ago.
[00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:41.909]  And I have to admit, I may be the only person in Butler, Pennsylvania that feels that way, but I feel a little bad for Tim Walz, if I'm being honest with you.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.019]  Because Tim Walz has to defend the indefensible.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:56.760]  He has to act like Kamala is going to drive down inflation, bring up wages and bring back jobs and restore peace, the very peace that she destroyed.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:01.139]  Well, I hate to break it to you, Tim, but everyone knows the truth.
[00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:08.889]  Kamala caused every single one of those problems because Kamala's day one in the White House was 1400 days ago.
[00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:13.190]  Never let her lie to you and pretend that she's gonna do something great.
[00:38:13.389 --> 00:38:17.869]  She's been in power for three and a half years and she hasn't done a damn thing.
[00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:33.309]  And you know, I hate to say it, but Kamala's record of failure is somehow only getting worse.
[00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:40.090]  Just a couple of days ago, I visited an area of our country ravaged by Hurricane Helene.
[00:38:41.449 --> 00:38:49.750]  The Appalachian region of Virginia, and we know the Appalachian region of this country has been left behind and ignored by a generation of American leaders.
[00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:55.489]  But what started out as a natural disaster is becoming a man-made disaster.
[00:38:56.369 --> 00:39:04.289]  When Appalachia was underwater, remember, President Biden was sitting on a beach and Kamala Harris was at a San Francisco fundraiser.
[00:39:04.409 --> 00:39:05.449]  That is not leadership.
[00:39:05.769 --> 00:39:06.889]  That is a disgrace.
[00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:19.010]  And now we're seeing reports that deployments of the military and the National Guard are moving at a snail's pace.
[00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:23.610]  My friends, who the hell is running this country right now?
[00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:26.250]  Because it sure isn't Joe Biden, it sure isn't Kamala Harris.
[00:39:29.789 --> 00:39:35.570]  The Harris administration has given billions of dollars to foreign countries and illegal aliens.
[00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:42.650]  But now they swoop in and they promise $750 to American citizens who have lost everything.
[00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:56.989]  To everybody watching, to everybody at this rally, I wanna say, I promise you, when Donald J. Trump is back in the White House, we're gonna have a president that puts America first.
[00:40:03.929 --> 00:40:09.030]  We're gonna ensure that emergency funding goes to American citizens and not illegal aliens.
[00:40:12.429 --> 00:40:17.429]  We're gonna create record prosperity with low inflation and rising take-home pay.
[00:40:19.449 --> 00:40:26.230]  We're gonna secure that southern border, stop the drug trafficking, and send illegal aliens back home where they belong.
[00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:39.889]  We're gonna drive down the cost of housing, drive down the cost of gas, drive down the cost of groceries, and we're gonna clean up our streets to make America safe again.
[00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:52.409]  And whether we agree or disagree with you, we will always defend your God-given right to speak your mind without fear of censorship, violence, or persecution.
[00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:08.429]  But to everybody struggling, I want you to know that though our country has, yes, been through some hard times over these past few years, I want you to know that help is on the way.
[00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:12.650]  We have Think about this.
[00:41:12.769 --> 00:41:19.010]  The most generous people, the most abundant natural resources, including some great energy right here in the state of Pennsylvania.
[00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:23.349]  We've got the hardest workers.
[00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:25.369]  We've got the best values.
[00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:32.309]  All we need to restore American greatness is leadership that is fit to serve this country.
[00:41:33.619 --> 00:41:40.420]  So more than anything, I'd like all of us to leave this incredible community with a message of hope.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:46.320]  Because I honestly believe that what happened right here in Butler is a metaphor for the United States of America.
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:54.880]  In this land, we may get knocked down, but we get right back up and we keep fighting because in America, hope is never lost.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:03.099]  We may face enemies who seek our demise, our destruction, and even our death.
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.199]  They may try to crush our spirits.
[00:42:05.519 --> 00:42:08.340]  They may try to convince us that victory is impossible.
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.000]  But in America, nothing is impossible.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:22.179]  And as long as that flag yet waves, and I see it's doing it today, there is no trial we cannot endure, no obstacle we cannot overcome, and no defeat we cannot turn into victory.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:36.559]  On this field, at this exact spot nearly three months ago, we thought President Trump was going to lose his life.
[00:42:37.099 --> 00:42:43.960]  But God still has a plan for him, just like he still has a plan for the United States of America.
[00:42:49.269 --> 00:42:53.010]  We, this movement, we have so much left to accomplish.
[00:42:53.690 --> 00:43:02.690]  And after the dark nights of trial, when the sun rises again, our flag is still going to be there and nothing will stop the United States of America.
[00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:19.170]  So I want you all, I know he'll be out in just a little bit, but I want you all, when Donald Trump comes out here, to give him a true Butler, Pennsylvania welcome.
[00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:23.570]  Because with Donald Trump as our leader, we are going to take this country back.
[00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:26.429]  We're going to make the American dream affordable again.
[00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:30.050]  And it's going to start right here in the great state of Pennsylvania.
[00:43:30.449 --> 00:43:32.570]  God bless you, Butler. Thank you for having me.
[00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:34.809]  And we are going to take this country back.
[00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:48.480]  I love you. The Justice Department back to Deep State has launched a new vicious attack on myself and Infowars.
[00:43:48.599 --> 00:44:00.119]  They're attempting to seize control of operations October 17th because they know coming up on November 13th Infowars is going up for sale at auction and they're worried patriots are going to buy it and the operation will continue on.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:17.829]  They are pulling out all the stops, have introduced A lawsuit, the Democrat Party back group in Travis County with judges they think they control to literally appoint a receiver over me personally and literally take control of my entire life,
[00:44:17.969 --> 00:44:19.869]  which is never going to happen and I'll never be silenced.
[00:44:20.429 --> 00:44:23.889]  They openly admit this is being done to silence me ahead of the election.
[00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:28.750]  Now, it's important to add that my lawyers have looked at this as a total violation of the 13th Amendment.
[00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:30.130]  I'm still on appeal.
[00:44:30.809 --> 00:44:32.949]  There are so many angles to this.
[00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:38.449]  The way they're doing it is just completely unconstitutional on its face, but they believe that they own these courts.
[00:44:38.789 --> 00:44:41.670]  But for me, this is a sign of how desperate the system is.
[00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:43.289]  The system's tried to kill Trump.
[00:44:43.929 --> 00:44:45.010]  They've imploded our borders.
[00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:46.349]  They're involved in giant human trafficking.
[00:44:46.489 --> 00:44:48.809]  They're starting World War III. FEMA's blocking aid.
[00:44:48.969 --> 00:44:53.409]  That's confirmed in the four battleground states affected by the terrible hurricane.
[00:44:53.809 --> 00:44:59.210]  They know that most of the rural areas don't even have power still and won't be able to have an election if they keep blocking it.
[00:44:59.809 --> 00:45:01.210]  I mean, they're just out in the open.
[00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:03.789]  They're not even trying to hide any of this.
[00:45:03.969 --> 00:45:08.289]  And remember six years ago when they came after me and deplatformed me first, I said, oh, you'll be next.
[00:45:08.369 --> 00:45:11.590]  And it ended up being millions of Americans and others and then even President Trump.
[00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:14.190]  So I need folks to rally to this fact.
[00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:16.710]  You should go to Real Alex Jones and read the filings I posted.
[00:45:16.969 --> 00:45:24.329]  They've also filed in federal court to say they own my name and to say that they own Real Alex Jones on X, which, again, all the presidents say they can't do.
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:31.659]  But they're still trying. And if I don't fight them in court, federal and at the local level, they will get rulings and use those precedents on you.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.000]  This is lawfare.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.760]  So please support me.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.019]  Please get this video out to everybody.
[00:45:36.219 --> 00:45:39.360]  Please get other talk shows talking about it, because this is going to affect everybody.
[00:45:41.049 --> 00:45:42.170]  I'm always the test case.
[00:45:42.369 --> 00:45:44.389]  And please visit our legal defense fund.
[00:45:44.769 --> 00:45:46.570]  This is so important. We're the tip of the spear.
[00:45:46.989 --> 00:45:51.750]  The globalists hate our guts at realalexjones.com and make a donation or support our sponsor.
[00:45:51.869 --> 00:45:55.489]  Get t-shirts, you name it, to fund the operation at thealexjonesstore.com.
[00:45:55.809 --> 00:45:57.289]  Thank you so much. This is Beyond Critical.
[00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:58.849]  God bless you. Please take action.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:09.320]  Alright folks, we are back after JD Vance gave a very strong speech and I think he listened to responses to the debate.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:24.449]  There were a lot of people after the debate, everybody agreed that J.D. Vance won the debate against Tim Walz, but a lot of people wish that he had talked more, spoken more about censorship, and he really emphasized that in this speech it was very strong.
[00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:41.909]  And he did imply, though not explicitly state, that the deep state was behind the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania by invoking the famous I think that were originated by Andrew Tate that first they tried to silence you through censorship,
[00:46:42.469 --> 00:46:46.789]  then they tried to imprison you, and then they tried to kill you if that doesn't work.
[00:46:46.889 --> 00:46:49.190]  Everybody has three lives, as Andrew Tate would say.
[00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:58.369]  And J.D. Vance walked through how the establishment, how the deep state has attempted to go through all three of Donald Trump's lives.
[00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:04.750]  They censored him and de-platformed him, took him off all the major social media platforms because of January 6th, allegedly.
[00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:08.130]  Then they tried to imprison him with all of this lawfare.
[00:47:08.269 --> 00:47:13.730]  And finally, at least two times that we know of, on at least two occasions, they have tried to take his life.
[00:47:13.769 --> 00:47:16.309]  Now, he wouldn't go so far as to explicitly state that it was the deep state.
[00:47:16.429 --> 00:47:22.070]  He said that it was because of the harmful rhetoric of the left and the Kamala Harris campaign and the mainstream media.
[00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:24.989]  But the implication there is that it was two times.
[00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:32.530]  And he even quoted Trump when Trump called him After the second assassination attempt, they tried to do it again.
[00:47:32.769 --> 00:47:36.050]  Do what, sir? Trump used the term they.
[00:47:36.289 --> 00:47:37.489]  What is they?
[00:47:37.809 --> 00:47:41.710]  If these are two independent rogue actors that are just lunatics, then it's not they.
[00:47:41.889 --> 00:47:46.989]  He would say another lunatic tried to kill me again, but he said they tried to kill me again.
[00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:57.750]  The Trump administration understands, the Trump campaign understands, Trump and his family understand that they, the deep state, are trying to take his life.
[00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:01.250]  That was the major revelation, I think, of that speech right there.
[00:48:01.329 --> 00:48:05.230]  And I don't think J.D. Vance really necessarily meant to convey that message or to leak that.
[00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:17.570]  But the fact that he quoted Trump in the way that he did implies to me that this is an admission, a revelation, explicit statement that the Trump administration understands that there is a coordinated conspiracy within the deep state to take his life.
[00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:19.250]  And he did another great job.
[00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:21.730]  I want to show you clip number 30 just for the sake of a little bit of levity.
[00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:27.969]  This is a gay liberal's response to J.D. Vance's performance at the debate against Tim Walz.
[00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:31.469]  Clip number 30, and then we'll get into more news on the other side while we wait for Trump to speak.
[00:48:32.559 --> 00:48:33.579]  Babe, I'm gonna be honest.
[00:48:33.699 --> 00:48:35.280]  Last night, I don't have ovaries.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:44.000]  Obviously, I'm a man. But last night when JD Vance went on stage, baby, my body was ticking for pregnancy.
[00:48:44.639 --> 00:48:45.920]  He went on stage.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:48.219]  I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican.
[00:48:48.239 --> 00:48:50.159]  He was wearing his pink tie.
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:51.980]  He was compassionate.
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.420]  He was loving.
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:56.420]  He comes from two Democratic parents.
[00:48:56.599 --> 00:48:57.900]  His mom had a drug addiction.
[00:48:58.039 --> 00:48:59.320]  Like, babe, he has substance.
[00:49:00.179 --> 00:49:03.000]  His mom had substance abuse, but he has substance.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.639]  And my body looking, ugh, like, oh my God.
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:09.500]  Oh my God, the blue eyes?
[00:49:09.739 --> 00:49:13.480]  Ladies, were we looking at those blue eyes that pierced us?
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:15.460]  It's almost like we went to Claire's.
[00:49:15.579 --> 00:49:17.019]  You know how Claire's does the piercings?
[00:49:17.599 --> 00:49:20.159]  Bitch, he pierced my vagina.
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:21.800]  I don't care what you say.
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:23.699]  I don't care what you say.
[00:49:24.019 --> 00:49:25.639]  He did something to me.
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:27.920]  Spiritually, physically.
[00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:31.510]  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
[00:49:31.989 --> 00:49:34.469]  Oh, my God. Absolutely hysterical.
[00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:44.250]  Meanwhile, we have this disaster happening in North Carolina specifically, but other areas as well, other states as well, as FEMA fails to respond adequately to this.
[00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:53.409]  This this weather attack on our Republic and in clip number 31 here, which I want to run in a second.
[00:49:53.829 --> 00:50:01.429]  We have Kamala Harris just emphasizing how important it is that we respond to disasters like this with equity as a priority.
[00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:19.460]  Clip number 31. It is our lowest income communities and our communities of color that are most impacted by these extreme conditions and impacted by issues that are not of their own making.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.690]  And women... Absolutely.
[00:50:22.269 --> 00:50:35.090]  And so we have to address this in a way that is about giving resources based on equity, understanding that we fight for equality, but we also need to fight for equity, understanding not everyone starts out at the same place.
[00:50:35.449 --> 00:50:40.050]  And if we want people to be in an equal place, sometimes we have to take into account those disparities.
[00:50:41.489 --> 00:50:55.869]  And while she emphasizes the importance of equity in disaster responses, if you have to select people by their race or gender or national origin in some different priority than just, hey, as soon as you get here and you need something, we're going to help you.
[00:50:55.989 --> 00:51:00.750]  Or as soon as we find you, we're going to help you no matter who you are, no matter what your immutable characteristics are.
[00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:02.670]  She just goes on.
[00:51:03.079 --> 00:51:08.840]  With more rhetoric to talk about how important it is that we just invite migrants and sponsor as many migrants to come to the United States as possible.
[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:14.239]  This is clip number 19 where Kamala is just incentivizing as many migrants to come into the United States as possible.
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:16.420]  We're going to get into this and unpack some more from her as well.
[00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:24.250]  Have a bipartisan approach to fixing this problem, which is a long-standing problem.
[00:51:24.489 --> 00:51:38.690]  But what are those solutions? The solutions include putting resources at the border to do what we can to process people effectively, and putting in place laws that actually allow for a meaningful pathway to citizenship.
[00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:41.190]  Okay, so she's saying pathway to citizenship.
[00:51:41.409 --> 00:51:58.119]  That's what's happening here. They're giving everybody legal status here in the United States, and then if they win, they're going to legislate a pathway to citizenship knowing that the disproportionate number of these migrants who have Become habitants of swing states will vote for Democrats in the event that they do this.
[00:51:58.219 --> 00:52:00.280]  They're trying to import voters.
[00:52:00.519 --> 00:52:01.699]  It's absolutely insane.
[00:52:02.079 --> 00:52:09.800]  And then she has the audacity, the gall to go to the border in clip number 22 in a $62,000 Tiffany necklace.
[00:52:10.289 --> 00:52:15.909]  Where people are struggling. I was in Eagle Pass when children were being pulled out of the Rio Grande having drowned.
[00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:18.090]  Some of them survived. Some of them dead.
[00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:19.889]  Happened several times a week while I was there.
[00:52:19.989 --> 00:52:22.769]  I talked to Border Patrol while I was there.
[00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:24.130]  They said it happens a few times a week.
[00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:25.449]  There are children dying.
[00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:29.449]  People starving. People swimming across in freezing water and then taking off their clothes.
[00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:31.909]  She's showing up in a $62,000 Tiffany necklace.
[00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:34.289]  I have no problem with people being wealthy or successful.
[00:52:34.469 --> 00:52:35.929]  I want to be wealthy and successful.
[00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:44.510]  But I would never show up To visit my friend who had just been paralyzed from the waist down, hopping into the hospital room on a pogo stick.
[00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:47.789]  That just adds insult to injury, literally insult to injury.
[00:52:47.889 --> 00:52:58.010]  Here she is in clip 22. And as president, I will work with Congress to create, at long last, a pathway to citizenship.
[00:52:58.289 --> 00:53:01.429]  There you go. For hardworking immigrants who have been here for years.
[00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:04.750]  For years.
[00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:12.010]  And deserve to have a system that works.
[00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:24.150]  As your president, I will protect our nation's sovereignty, secure our border, and work to fix our broken system of immigration.
[00:53:26.969 --> 00:53:31.929]  If you think she actually cares about anybody, whether they're migrants or Americans, then let's just look at clip number 23 here.
[00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:39.110]  This is someone on Jesse Waters' show talking about how the government just simply took too long to respond to this disaster.
[00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:41.429]  They weren't there quick enough. They allowed it to play out.
[00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:49.349]  And we've seen reports that they're continuing to get in the way of volunteers that are there trying to fly supplies or identify where people are stranded using drones.
[00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:51.269]  It's unbelievable. Clip number 23.
[00:53:52.349 --> 00:53:55.429]  It's... It's too late.
[00:53:55.889 --> 00:53:59.570]  I mean... They took too long.
[00:54:02.349 --> 00:54:04.989]  It took them five days to get here.
[00:54:05.769 --> 00:54:12.469]  I mean, it took five days for Biden to come here, and he didn't think we were worth coming down to see us himself.
[00:54:12.469 --> 00:54:14.730]  He had to fly over on his way to Raleigh.
[00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:20.590]  It's disgraceful. I mean, they keep saying we the people.
[00:54:20.849 --> 00:54:22.349]  No, there is no we the people.
[00:54:22.449 --> 00:54:23.829]  It's them versus us.
[00:54:23.969 --> 00:54:26.130]  They're not for us. It's all about them.
[00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:29.110]  They tell us what we need instead of listening to us.
[00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:36.510]  And how about this box clip of a woman telling the story of how her son was killed as the anchor cries.
[00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:43.159]  Watch this. You know, I'm so proud of my son because in his last moments, he wasn't screaming for me.
[00:54:43.519 --> 00:54:46.780]  He was screaming, Jesus, Jesus, save me.
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.199]  Jesus, I hear you.
[00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:49.960]  Jesus, I'm calling upon you.
[00:54:50.179 --> 00:54:54.659]  And his wildest dreams and everything that he wanted to be was a superhero.
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.840]  And that was his goal in life.
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:59.440]  And instead, he's my hero because...
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:08.260]  He reached for something past flesh, past human, past anything that even grown adults, I think, would reach for.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:10.900]  My son called out to the one God Almighty.
[00:55:11.619 --> 00:55:15.599]  And I think at that moment, he was rescued and he became my hero.
[00:55:15.599 --> 00:55:18.219]  And I think all of them carried me through that moment.
[00:55:18.639 --> 00:55:25.739]  I think that his biggest dreams, he was the smartest, bravest, hopeful, great friend.
[00:55:26.949 --> 00:55:30.010]  Great son. I couldn't have asked for a better son.
[00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:35.030]  And he was so happy up until the very end when he was screaming for Jesus.
[00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:37.170]  And in that moment, I think he found joy.
[00:55:38.329 --> 00:55:41.409]  You know, the innocence of children is actually quite spectacular.
[00:55:42.389 --> 00:55:43.889]  Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.
[00:55:46.159 --> 00:55:47.900]  Yeah, it is.
[00:55:48.539 --> 00:55:55.500]  Marissa being a mother too, Megan and Heather, I do, amidst the tragedy, your parents as well.
[00:55:55.500 --> 00:56:00.900]  Absolutely disgusting. While Majorca is another leftist say that this is a result of climate change, well, let's just say hypothetically that's true.
[00:56:01.019 --> 00:56:02.559]  It's not, but let's say hypothetically that's true.
[00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:07.539]  These storms and these natural disasters are happening all the time, and it's so predictable because of climate change.
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:16.239]  Well, if it's so predictable and it's happening all the time because of climate change, then why aren't you doing things to prepare so little boys don't get swept away in a flood right before their mother's eyes?
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:22.420]  I saw reports that several dead bodies were found with their arms linked together.
[00:56:22.559 --> 00:56:24.380]  They were all dead, apparently neighbors.
[00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:30.309]  If this is so predictable, then how come you can't do something to stop this type of disaster from happening?
[00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:41.789]  But here's clip eight. This is Krasenstein coming out and saying that, no, it's all misinformation that FEMA has been giving all of its money to migrants instead of for disaster relief.
[00:56:41.869 --> 00:56:43.369]  That's just totally a miscalculation.
[00:56:43.429 --> 00:56:44.510]  They're trying to rationalize.
[00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:03.710]  So many of you may have heard the rumors spreading.
[00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:21.829]  Elon Musk is spreading the rumor, Greg Abbott of Texas, and multiple Republicans and MAGA Republicans on X. They're saying that there's not enough money for hurricane victims in North Carolina, in Georgia, in Florida, because the money has been diverted to illegal immigrants.
[00:57:22.269 --> 00:57:25.090]  They bring up this number, $640 million.
[00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:32.949]  They claim that $640 million went to illegal immigrants, so FEMA doesn't have enough money to pay for hurricane victims.
[00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:35.050]  This is a lie.
[00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:38.130]  It's an outright lie, and they know it.
[00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:40.989]  So what actually happened?
[00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:48.309]  Well, first of all, you have to understand how money is allocated to FEMA. It comes from Congress.
[00:57:48.949 --> 00:57:58.289]  And currently, Congress is made up of the Senate, which is pretty much equal, and the House of Representatives, which is controlled by Republicans.
[00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:03.110]  They are the ones who set the budget and determine what money goes where.
[00:58:03.789 --> 00:58:05.829]  The budget that's signed by the President of the United States.
[00:58:06.559 --> 00:58:15.440]  Couldn't have been used for hurricane relief instead of for shelter and services, which went to some migrants.
[00:58:15.679 --> 00:58:18.400]  Oh, so we did spend $640 million on migrants.
[00:58:18.619 --> 00:58:21.260]  And we did run out of money for hurricane victims.
[00:58:21.599 --> 00:58:25.000]  I believe it was back in October for $20 billion.
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:29.380]  For FEMA to use on disaster relief.
[00:58:29.539 --> 00:58:31.420]  So they have this disaster relief program.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:38.219]  That money is used for earthquakes, wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, and other natural disasters.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:41.820]  $20 billion was allocated to them thanks to Congress.
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:47.949]  Also, in April, earlier, $640 million.
[00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:54.030]  Now, keep in mind, $20 billion is 31 times larger than $640 million.
[00:58:54.849 --> 00:59:05.849]  $640 million was allocated to the Shelter and Services Program, which gives money to FEMA, to DHS, and to Customs and Border Patrol for...
[00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:09.369]  Great job on Border Patrol.
[00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:16.449]  And again, this was a Republican-led House that approved this funding.
[00:59:16.570 --> 00:59:20.530]  A Democrat-led Senate and a Democrat White House which signs all the budgets.
[00:59:20.909 --> 00:59:24.469]  But even if it was Republicans' fault, it's still this administration.
[00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:26.449]  And nobody's celebrating Republicans here.
[00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:33.989]  We're trying to get a populist into the office of the President of the United States because both parties have failed both of their constituents incessantly for decades.
[00:59:34.849 --> 00:59:38.730]  That can't be done. Congress is the only ones who decides that.
[00:59:38.989 --> 00:59:40.670]  The head of FEMA doesn't decide that.
[00:59:41.070 --> 00:59:42.530]  The President of the United States doesn't decide that.
[00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:45.690]  Then get Congress together if you're the President of the United States and have them allocate money now!
[00:59:45.789 --> 00:59:54.969]  ... $640 million for the Shelters and Services Plan and $20 billion for the Disaster Relief Plan, which is running dry.
[00:59:55.170 --> 01:00:01.969]  Why? Because we've been having so many large hurricanes, large tornadoes, and wildfires.
[01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:07.880]  That's why. But you can't blame this on anyone other than Congress who didn't give enough money.
[01:00:08.239 --> 01:00:14.280]  And climate change, because we're having these large disasters at an increasing scale.
[01:00:14.519 --> 01:00:16.079]  So Trump is wrong.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.880]  Elon Musk is wrong. Greg Abbott is wrong.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:25.420]  And all the MAGA Republicans who are trying to make this out to be, oh, they diverted money to migrants so there's not enough hurricane money.
[01:00:25.519 --> 01:00:27.119]  That is not true.
[01:00:27.539 --> 01:00:31.860]  It is a lie. Such an abundantly stupid angle or take on what happened.
[01:00:32.699 --> 01:00:35.300]  Such an, just egregiously stupid.
[01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:38.699]  And we know that the leftists want to sponsor the migrants to come here.
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:50.420]  We have Kamala Harris incessantly insisting that we have a path to citizenship for all these migrants which are landing in these swing states and cities by the tune of 20,000 Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, of all places.
[01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:54.190]  We know that Nancy Pelosi has come out and said that we need a pathway to citizenship.
[01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:57.130]  We know that Biden has come out and said that we need a pathway to citizenship.
[01:00:57.429 --> 01:01:01.030]  We know that Hillary Clinton comes out all the time and says that we need a pathway to citizenship.
[01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:08.469]  And now, in clip number 24, we have Schumer basically justifying saying why it is that we're importing migrants right here before our very eyes.
[01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:13.139]  Watch. Now more than ever, we're short of workers.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:20.780]  We have a population that is not reproducing it on its own with the same level that it used to.
[01:01:21.199 --> 01:01:28.340]  The only way we're going to have a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants, the Dreamers, and all of them.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:36.800]  Because our ultimate goal is to help the Dreamers, but get a path to citizenship for all 11 million or however many undocumented there are here.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:52.110]  Oh, there we go. I think?
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:05.920]  Import indiscriminately as many migrants as possible so they can fill the jobs that are not being filled by a dying boomer generation.
[01:02:06.179 --> 01:02:07.960]  It's unbelievable to me.
[01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:13.320]  And this is all happening in the context of Majorca saying that FEMA is just abundantly prepared.
[01:02:13.579 --> 01:02:15.820]  There's nothing wrong whatsoever in clip number 35.
[01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:17.500]  Unbelievable. Watch this.
[01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:20.469]  FEMA is tremendously prepared.
[01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:22.170]  This is what we do.
[01:02:22.429 --> 01:02:23.969]  This is what they do.
[01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:32.070]  And the key here, Rebecca, is also to make sure that the communities who are potentially impacted are prepared as well.
[01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:43.010]  And it's not just hurricanes and wildfires, also extreme heat, which certainly some parts of the United States are already experiencing.
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:49.920]  Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas sounding the alarm on FEMA funding right after the devastation of Hurricane Helene.
[01:02:50.039 --> 01:02:56.739]  Listen. We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.280]  We are expecting another hurricane hitting.
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.440]  We do not have the funds.
[01:03:01.639 --> 01:03:05.159]  FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.
[01:03:05.599 --> 01:03:14.179]  This all comes as the Biden-Harris administration spent over a billion dollars from a FEMA program on services for migrants.
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:17.980]  Attorney General of the great state of Florida, Ashley Moody joins me now.
[01:03:18.119 --> 01:03:19.199]  A.G. Moody. It's unbelievable.
[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:22.139]  And in clip number 12, Biden doesn't even know.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.400]  The president of the United States doesn't even know what storm people are talking about.
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:28.820]  Watch this. What do the states in the storm zone need, Mr.
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:33.519]  President? What do the states in the storm zone, what do they need after what you saw today?
[01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:36.539]  Oh, on the storm zone?
[01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:40.920]  Yes, sir. What?
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:48.880]  Not only is he on vacation more than any other president in history, it was like 40% of the days he was in office or something astronomical like that, I can't recall.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.659]  He's on vacation at the beach incessantly.
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:54.260]  He doesn't know what disaster is taking place.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.980]  We have Mayorkas saying the opposite.
[01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:11.139]  We're good to go.
[01:04:12.369 --> 01:04:21.130]  We shouldn't be allocating any money to any foreign interests or foreigners in the United States of America that could be spent on the once needs and interests of the American people themselves.
[01:04:21.289 --> 01:04:24.230]  It's not about racism or xenophobia or anything like that.
[01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:26.409]  It's not a bigoted approach. It's just justice.
[01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:34.050]  Because when our taxes go to this government, then it is the duty of this government to spend those taxes on our interests.
[01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:38.309]  Otherwise, it's a betrayal. It's literally treason right before our eyes.
[01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:42.769]  And frankly, what this boils down to in my eyes now is just blatant election interference.
[01:04:42.949 --> 01:04:44.349]  I'm going to show you clip number 15 in a second.
[01:04:44.449 --> 01:04:49.389]  This is RFK Jr. talking about how the CIA engaged in election interference in 2020.
[01:04:49.809 --> 01:04:55.170]  Certainly, it's not the first time that the CIA has engaged in election interference, both domestic and abroad.
[01:04:55.349 --> 01:05:09.949]  But what we're seeing right now is a languid Response to this disaster because it has affected areas occupied and inhabited by Trump supporters, and they don't want these Trump supporters to vote.
[01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:11.429]  Let's watch clip number 15, please.
[01:05:12.619 --> 01:05:20.300]  I'm about to talk about what we're not allowed to talk about, so instead of the word interference, I'm gonna use the word tomatoes just for fun, and you'll understand what I mean here.
[01:05:20.579 --> 01:05:36.420]  Because RFK said a lot of amazing things on the Tucker Carlson interview he just did, but one big thing that he said out loud that no one's been saying out loud yet is that the CIA actively did election tomatoes in the 2020 election, and we all know it, and it's well-proven,
[01:05:36.519 --> 01:05:41.039]  and it's not controversial, But no one wants to admit it or talk about it.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:06:00.239]  And I'm just gonna throw some shots across the bow right now at the start of this video that any platform that censors this video is actively engaging in election tomatoes again by censoring not only free speech but true free speech that is being critical of their handlers in the agency.
[01:06:00.539 --> 01:06:13.809]  And Democrats can't even hear this story because It touches so many sort of culture war buttons, but it's a true story that Biden slapped up suddenly became an issue about a week before the debate.
[01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:41.360]  And Anthony Blinken, who is now the Secretary of State and who was then the director of President Biden's campaign, went to Gina Haspel, Remember this whole headline?
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:45.900]  Everything he just said is true, and I'm about to show you the original sources, the actual documents.
[01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:47.949]  This is just basic facts.
[01:06:48.570 --> 01:07:02.590]  More than 50 former senior intelligence officials, it was 51 to be exact, signed this letter outlining their belief that recent disclosed emails about the laptop has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.
[01:07:02.909 --> 01:07:18.239]  This is the actual letter which no one decided to actually read because they lay out their allegations and then they say, quote, We want to emphasize that we do not know if the emails provided to the New York Post by President Trump's personal attorney Giuliani are genuine or not,
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:22.539]  and that we do not have evidence of Russian involvement.
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:28.039]  Just that our experience makes us deeply suspicious that the Russian government played a significant role in this case.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.440]  So literally nothing.
[01:07:29.559 --> 01:07:30.880]  They're just making up claims.
[01:07:32.169 --> 01:07:33.889]  To do what, exactly?
[01:07:34.349 --> 01:07:39.610]  I mean, it's not like the CIA has been doing election tomatoes all across the world ever since it was first founded.
[01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:46.690]  Look it up. They do it with bags of cash, they do it with coups, they do it with assassinations, all sorts of things.
[01:07:46.929 --> 01:07:48.630]  In this case, they do it with information.
[01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:52.869]  And all 51 of these dudes signed this letter, and at the bottom it tells you who they are.
[01:07:53.190 --> 01:08:02.369]  This is all of their names in the order in which they appear, and you only need to look up the first two to realize, huh, Jim Clapper, former director of national intelligence?
[01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:06.849]  Yeah, he perjured himself when he lied to us about the NSA spying operations.
[01:08:07.849 --> 01:08:16.289]  Oh, and Michael Hayden? Yeah, he set up those NSA spying operations, lied to us about them, and then he also lied to us about the torture programs at places like Guantanamo Bay.
[01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:20.970]  Oh, and by the way, Gina Haskell, the CIA director that RFK was referencing at the start.
[01:08:21.069 --> 01:08:28.569]  Obviously, we have a situation in which the CIA is abundantly clear that they engage in election interference.
[01:08:29.699 --> 01:08:30.939]  It's obvious. We have a deep state.
[01:08:31.039 --> 01:08:41.079]  That's what the deep state is. It's an unaccountable aspect, branch, department, section form of our government that is underground.
[01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:43.439]  So nothing that it does is transparent.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:47.560]  And by virtue of not being transparent, they're never held accountable for the crimes that they commit.
[01:08:48.619 --> 01:08:58.779]  Things like allowing disaster relief to slow down for the sake of impacting an election or covering up a Hunter Biden laptop story they knew was true for the sake of getting an election to go a certain direction.
[01:08:59.199 --> 01:09:03.359]  Alex Jones just sent me this tweet here from John LaFerre.
[01:09:03.989 --> 01:09:18.789]  I don't know.
[01:09:18.989 --> 01:09:20.289]  The Mallorcas still have a job.
[01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:25.250]  He is evasive, combative, smug, and perjurious during compelled testimony.
[01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:29.069]  He's been impeached by the House only to have Chuck Schumer protect him in the Senate.
[01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:32.630]  This is everything that is wrong with our federal government.
[01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:33.829]  Let's go into clip number 10 here.
[01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:41.569]  Here's a woman who overheard four FEMA executives while she was at the airport in response to this Hurricane Helene disaster watch.
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:52.060]  Picked up a flight of pediatric medical supplies that were brought in and are going to North Asheville.
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:10:00.319]  We were sitting in the private portion of the airport and we got to overhear an awful lot.
[01:10:00.579 --> 01:10:06.939]  The army pilots, the navy pilots, hospital representatives, there was a lot of chatter.
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:13.430]  While we were there, A private jet landed and four FEMA representatives got off.
[01:10:13.829 --> 01:10:16.750]  Four. Four people off of a private jet.
[01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:23.029]  Come to find out, and you're not going to hear this, so let me tell you.
[01:10:23.869 --> 01:10:34.470]  Come to find out Mission Hospital was told, a private hospital, that they are going to go ahead and be the morgue center for body recovery.
[01:10:35.569 --> 01:10:42.430]  All of the Army Chinook helicopters you're seeing flying overhead, they are doing body recovery.
[01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:56.329]  FEMA said, and you can take this as a direct quote, said that they are too tied up at the border to send any more representatives.
[01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:59.270]  Yeah, at the border.
[01:10:59.970 --> 01:11:05.270]  So anyhow, I guess border control trumps whatever's going on here.
[01:11:05.859 --> 01:11:13.920]  So they told Mission Hospital they are not sending refrigerated trucks so that they can stack the bodies up.
[01:11:14.619 --> 01:11:24.699]  And we also overheard that whatever fatality numbers you are hearing, and this is a quote, go ahead and add a couple of zeros.
[01:11:25.579 --> 01:11:27.340]  So FEMA is too busy with the border.
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:40.140]  A private hospital and the army are going to take over body recovery and private individuals with their private helicopters and their private planes are the ones who are flying in supplies.
[01:11:40.619 --> 01:11:43.000]  I was at Hangar 10. I was picking up supplies.
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:45.539]  There was a stack for the Cajun Navy.
[01:11:45.859 --> 01:11:52.119]  There was a stack that looked like it was ASPCA. These are all being sent by private individuals.
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.060]  FEMA is doing nothing.
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:57.380]  Go ahead and share that.
[01:11:58.510 --> 01:11:59.770]  Well, there you have it, folks.
[01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:01.670]  Right before our eyes.
[01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:04.930]  And we know that they're losing this election for so many reasons.
[01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:12.529]  They're losing because Trump has survived two assassination attempts, one of which was iconic and historic and epic in the most cinematic way possible.
[01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:15.270]  I don't think a movie could have made something more epic.
[01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:20.069]  It was the most epic thing that I've ever seen since Maximus and Gladiator said, are you not entertained?
[01:12:20.449 --> 01:12:23.069]  It was abundantly awesome what happened.
[01:12:23.439 --> 01:12:27.119]  And then we have this debate between Kamala Harris and Trump, where Trump won.
[01:12:27.199 --> 01:12:30.100]  He should have won by more, but it was a 60-40 win, maybe 75-25.
[01:12:30.479 --> 01:12:34.539]  Then we have this debate between J.D. Vance and Tim Walls, where J.D. Vance obviously won.
[01:12:34.699 --> 01:12:38.979]  All of the polymarket polls show that it was clear that J.D. Vance won.
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:40.340]  J.D. Vance was the right choice.
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:42.659]  Tim Walls was the wrong choice.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:48.939]  We've got an economy that is totally shattered, and Kamala Harris tries to say that it has nothing to do with her economic policies.
[01:12:49.659 --> 01:13:05.920]  We've got a border that's wide open and Kamala Harris tries to say that all the problems happening in Springfield, Ohio or other places throughout the nation have nothing to do with the fact that we've imported tens of millions of migrants into this country, hundreds of thousands of them criminals, hundreds of thousands of them convicted criminals, millions of them likely criminals,
[01:13:06.239 --> 01:13:11.479]  325,000 at least missing children, victims of human trafficking.
[01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:26.850]  Absolutely nothing is going in favor of the Biden administration between the Afghanistan withdrawal, the economy, foreign policy being on the brink of World War III in a way that we've never been before, even at the height of the Cold War, that all these conflicts are totally escalating.
[01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:47.210]  Everything is worse. The only single thing I can think of that this administration, when I try really hard, that this administration has successfully done, and they really only did it for political reasons because this election is coming up, is they stopped the longshoremen's I think?
[01:14:02.539 --> 01:14:13.180]  But we know that as a result of all of the pains and ills and ills that the American people are feeling as a result of this administration, that this is going to be an incredibly contested campaign.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:21.140]  And if Kamala Harris somehow manages to rig this election enough to steal this election enough to win or claim victory on November 5th.
[01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:25.550]  Democrats understand that there's potential for violence.
[01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:27.850]  I'm not threatening violence. I'm not even advocating for violence.
[01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:33.689]  I hope there's no violence in this country ever again in any capacity, whether it's one-on-one or a group of people on another group of people.
[01:14:33.869 --> 01:14:41.649]  I don't want to see a civil war in this country because I understand how devastating, despite the fact that we would win, how devastating such a conflict would be.
[01:14:42.439 --> 01:14:44.100]  I don't want my daughters to experience that.
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:45.300]  I don't want to experience it.
[01:14:45.359 --> 01:14:48.520]  I don't want to see anybody starve or raped or murdered or kidnapped.
[01:14:48.859 --> 01:14:58.359]  I don't want to witness anything that comes with the Civil War and all of those things come in abundance when there is such disorder and chaos and conflict and violence in our country.
[01:14:58.539 --> 01:15:04.130]  But we have... Joe Biden, in clip number 34, admitting that he predicts violence.
[01:15:04.369 --> 01:15:07.090]  He says, I'm concerned about what they're going to do.
[01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:09.329]  Biden warns election may be violent.
[01:15:09.489 --> 01:15:11.949]  This is Raw Egg Nationalist reporting on Infowars.com.
[01:15:12.069 --> 01:15:13.270]  Let's run clip number 34.
[01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:16.909]  ...election and that it will be peaceful.
[01:15:18.050 --> 01:15:19.250]  Two separate questions.
[01:15:19.529 --> 01:15:21.250]  I'm confident to be free and fair.
[01:15:22.649 --> 01:15:24.369]  I don't know whether it will be peaceful.
[01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:33.539]  The things that Trump has said and the things that he said last time out When he didn't like the outcome of the election were very dangerous.
[01:15:34.819 --> 01:15:42.119]  If you notice, I noticed that the vice presidential Republican candidate did not say he'd accept the outcome of the election.
[01:15:42.899 --> 01:15:45.100]  They haven't even accepted the outcome of the last election.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:49.800]  So I'm concerned about what they're going to do.
[01:15:49.979 --> 01:15:52.000]  And they know that they're going to lose.
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:53.739]  I mean, let's just look at clip number 16 here.
[01:15:53.819 --> 01:15:56.579]  This is CNN stunned at some of the reporting.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.220]  They're shocked at the polls.
[01:15:58.479 --> 01:15:59.779]  They're shocked at all the numbers.
[01:15:59.899 --> 01:16:01.000]  We're going to go through a few clips like this.
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:12.640]  Clip number 16. that came out yesterday, Quinnipiac, our CNN polling, the Gallup poll indicators right now, the nervous campaign this morning is the Harris campaign.
[01:16:12.819 --> 01:16:14.260]  They're not where they need to be with young voters.
[01:16:14.439 --> 01:16:18.039]  They're not where they need to be with voters of color, working class voters.
[01:16:18.239 --> 01:16:22.500]  They're not achieving the margins that they need that Joe Biden was getting in 2020.
[01:16:22.819 --> 01:16:24.380]  And Trump's base is immovable.
[01:16:24.619 --> 01:16:29.979]  And right now, his administration and him personally are more popular than they have ever been.
[01:16:30.279 --> 01:16:36.760]  Or clip number 20, MSNBC's Ari Melber losing it after a formerly anti-Trump person is saying they're coming out and voting for Trump.
[01:16:36.859 --> 01:16:39.539]  Let's run this. A no for you after that.
[01:16:39.699 --> 01:16:43.539]  Why was it important for you to say no more Trump because of his January 6th conduct?
[01:16:43.699 --> 01:16:47.039]  And do you stand by that? No, I don't stand by it, and I'll tell you why.
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:17:03.979]  I've now lived four years under the Biden-Harris policies, and I have to say that those policies are not only becoming an existential threat to our country's way of life, But to our allies as well.
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:08.659]  I'll let you finish, but this is so striking.
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:11.579]  You said it was a no for me after that.
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:15.760]  I did. And here we are right now, and you're saying it's a yes for you.
[01:17:15.859 --> 01:17:18.479]  It is a yes for me. It is an absolute yes for me.
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:24.510]  That is how badly The Biden-Harris team have prosecuted their job.
[01:17:24.649 --> 01:17:32.569]  But the whole point you seem to be making was that January 6th and that kind of attack on democracy is bigger than any policy.
[01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:38.069]  But I am seeing so many attacks on democracy that eclipse January 6th.
[01:17:38.130 --> 01:17:39.609]  In the mid-months upon months.
[01:17:39.979 --> 01:17:44.000]  Years, frankly, of Democrats saying that billionaires need to pay their fair share.
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:48.659]  Of AOC wearing a tax-the-rich dress at some gala.
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:53.359]  Of Kamala Harris wearing a $62,000 necklace to the border.
[01:17:53.579 --> 01:18:01.220]  Of their just extravagance and abundance and private jets and hypocrisy and smugness and self-righteousness.
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:03.000]  And Frank sent Satanism.
[01:18:04.409 --> 01:18:10.869]  We see Mark Cuban in clip number 21 as a billionaire have the audacity and come out and still criticize Trump.
[01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:12.369]  Let's watch this.
[01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:16.949]  Does anyone believe a word they hear from Mark Cuban in clip number 21 here?
[01:18:18.329 --> 01:18:21.909]  How would you think about the four years that he was president?
[01:18:22.109 --> 01:18:25.109]  In hindsight, what would you say was done well?
[01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:27.329]  What would you say was done poorly?
[01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:29.350]  Just those two things.
[01:18:29.569 --> 01:18:36.189]  I think the way he dealt with Zeitgeist isn't the right word.
[01:18:36.409 --> 01:18:40.949]  Just the vibe of the country was really, really, really bad.
[01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:49.449]  I think the hate that he conveyed, I think the fact that what he tweeted negatively, so companies didn't know what was coming next.
[01:18:49.829 --> 01:18:51.670]  He tweeted negatively about me.
[01:18:51.829 --> 01:18:54.149]  He tweeted negatively about other people.
[01:18:54.329 --> 01:18:55.789]  I thought that was a real bad thing.
[01:18:55.930 --> 01:19:05.479]  When the BLM protests happened and turned into riots, When they went into Minnesota, he was like, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.
[01:19:05.859 --> 01:19:07.239]  Who the f*** says that as a president?
[01:19:07.539 --> 01:19:14.840]  And so we had more people die during riots during his term than Biden by a long shot.
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:18.619]  And I think he misrepresented where he stood in terms of being anti-war.
[01:19:18.819 --> 01:19:27.579]  If you go back to 2019 and look at the war in Yemen, There were at least 100,000 people plus died.
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:33.039]  And there was a bipartisan resolution to say, we're not selling any more to the Saudis.
[01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:35.239]  We're not selling any more weapons to the Saudis.
[01:19:35.359 --> 01:19:42.880]  And a bipartisan resolution, including Mark Meadows and Rand Paul and others, passed it, and it went to his desk.
[01:19:43.819 --> 01:19:51.840]  We're still going to sell these munitions and these weapons to Saudi Arabia, even though these people continue to die.
[01:19:52.020 --> 01:20:02.720]  So when we talk about, it's not all that much different than Ukraine in some respects, only Saudi Arabia got the Glengarry leads, and Ukraine got our old stuff, and we replaced it.
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:08.300]  And so when he comes out now and says, look, You know, I'm against all wars.
[01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:10.199]  There were no wars. That's bullshit, right?
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:13.619]  The mainstream media. Well, okay, so there's two things there.
[01:20:13.819 --> 01:20:20.539]  So just on the 2020 riots, I don't know how you blame Trump for the BLM riots of summer of 2020.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:21.619]  I didn't blame him for the riots.
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.020]  What I said was how he dealt with it.
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:25.159]  I get you don't like the mean tweets.
[01:20:25.659 --> 01:20:27.840]  It's not about mean tweets. No, don't diminish it, David.
[01:20:27.979 --> 01:20:29.479]  Don't diminish it as just mean tweets.
[01:20:29.859 --> 01:20:31.479]  People pay attention to what happens.
[01:20:31.859 --> 01:20:37.539]  And when you have people whose lives are in state— I think it's far worse to actually have riots going on in the streets.
[01:20:37.659 --> 01:20:38.880]  That's what needed to be controlled.
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:40.420]  How many people— Hold on.
[01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:42.380]  He wanted to send the National Guard to Minnesota.
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:45.020]  It was actually Walt who rejected the National Guard.
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:54.140]  He had no problem. And there were plenty of ties between Democratic activists and the BLM organizers of those riots.
[01:20:54.479 --> 01:20:55.859]  Time Magazine did my story on that.
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:58.199]  I'm not saying he's at fault that the riots happened.
[01:20:58.619 --> 01:21:04.340]  I understand, but I can't believe they're using the riots throughout the summer of 2020 as an argument against Trump when it was the left that did that in this country.
[01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:08.079]  No, I think what he's saying is the leadership that he shows is of low moral character.
[01:21:09.869 --> 01:21:11.489]  Did he do anything right, Mark?
[01:21:11.949 --> 01:21:13.149]  Well, I'm not done with the wrong stuff.
[01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:18.010]  But wait, there's more. Let's go back to the foreign policy for a second.
[01:21:18.369 --> 01:21:22.170]  Trump is correct that he did not start any new wars during his presidency.
[01:21:22.449 --> 01:21:24.949]  You agree with that, right? Um...
[01:21:25.989 --> 01:21:29.090]  That no new war started or he didn't start any...
[01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:30.250]  He didn't start any.
[01:21:30.489 --> 01:21:33.250]  He was like the first president in 20 years not to start a new war.
[01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:34.829]  Well, he inherited some for sure.
[01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:39.569]  He inherited Syria and Afghanistan and he wanted to get out and the generals didn't let him.
[01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:41.670]  And there wasn't really a war that happened in Turkey.
[01:21:41.829 --> 01:21:44.649]  And then when we got shot down...
[01:21:44.649 --> 01:21:46.989]  Unbelievable. No, there wasn't really a war.
[01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:50.970]  I'll agree with that. That's his argument is that he did not start any new wars.
[01:21:51.159 --> 01:21:52.199]  And here's the thing.
[01:21:52.359 --> 01:21:54.720]  Let's just go into the racism conversation a little bit.
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:22:05.800]  Since BLM came up, since the Summer of Love came up, and the riots came up, and the George Floyd thing came up, all these criticisms from the left for years have been that Trump is somehow inherently racist because of his rhetoric against migrants.
[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:24.060]  I know people who are immigrants here that believe that somehow Trump is racist against migrants because they've watched mainstream media reporting discuss Donald Trump discussing migrants without actually watching the rhetoric or the language used by Trump himself regarding the issue.
[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:31.659]  The issue isn't people who want to come over here and work and send money back home or people who want to come over here and start a family and become American.
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:43.899]  The issue is not people who want to immigrate to the United States of America The issue is the fact that we have allowed a half a million at least convicted criminals to come into the United States illegally with no accountability whatsoever.
[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:48.340]  And then when we do catch them, we release them back into our communities and they commit more crimes.
[01:22:48.479 --> 01:22:49.539]  This happens over and over again.
[01:22:49.619 --> 01:22:53.140]  We're not even deporting people until like the third time they've committed a major crime.
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:23:02.420]  While Kamala Harris is paying for the bail of people during BLM, I think that the black community understands that this migrant crisis is disproportionately affecting them.
[01:23:02.659 --> 01:23:08.340]  I think that the black community understands that inflation itself is disproportionately affecting them negatively.
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:17.699]  And I think they're going to wake up and they're going to vote for Donald Trump in a way that the black community has never voted for a Republican candidate in the history, basically since Abraham Lincoln or the late 19th century.
[01:23:18.289 --> 01:23:23.529]  And Democrats, I haven't seen them this mad since Republicans took away their slaves.
[01:23:23.729 --> 01:23:29.390]  Let's watch clip number seven here of a black podcaster defending Trump on the issue of racism right before our eyes.
[01:23:29.489 --> 01:23:39.829]  Let's watch. No, he didn't.
[01:23:41.489 --> 01:23:56.890]  No, he didn't.
[01:24:01.419 --> 01:24:03.640]  That happened under Barack Obama.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:07.260]  But did it happen?
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.439]  It happened. Yes, it did happen.
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:11.060]  We talk about one-way aggression.
[01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:16.560]  You allowed to be openly racist towards one particular group of people, and it's white people.
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.600]  Let's call a spade a spade.
[01:24:20.250 --> 01:24:21.470]  White men are the issue.
[01:24:21.670 --> 01:24:23.329]  White men are the biggest threat to America.
[01:24:23.529 --> 01:24:44.380]  They are. But Chuck,
[01:24:44.479 --> 01:24:52.859]  just because you can't get on mainstream media and make light of other races doesn't mean that the racial climate is still not what it is.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.420]  The reason why the racial climate is what it is is because that's what critical race theory seeks to do.
[01:24:57.659 --> 01:25:02.920]  It seeks to polarize for the purpose of finding people who are sympathetic to your cause.
[01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:15.840]  And you keep on dividing one group onto itself until you create a group of disenchanted, angry, dysfunctional people that you can then use for the purpose of your liberation.
[01:25:16.079 --> 01:25:17.140]  That's not my words.
[01:25:17.279 --> 01:25:20.199]  Those are the words of Herbert Marcuse himself.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:32.140]  Anybody talking about race in this country or talking about critical race theory and have never heard the writings of the words of Herbert Marcuse, you cannot sit at this table and talk because you don't know the theory, you don't know the science.
[01:25:32.359 --> 01:25:38.779]  But, like, somebody never heard of them, but in their own eyes, they look out into the world and think, yo, that shit is fishy to me.
[01:25:38.899 --> 01:25:41.380]  I don't give a damn about what you go out in the world and see.
[01:25:41.479 --> 01:25:43.859]  A racial slur was spray-painted on the front.
[01:25:44.119 --> 01:25:47.939]  Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez is dealing with a racist...
[01:25:47.939 --> 01:25:50.399]  ...noose found in the garage stall of Bubba Wallace.
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:56.640]  See, this is all about narrative weaving and storytelling because they play upon people's emotions and how they feel.
[01:25:56.699 --> 01:25:58.140]  If I go to a doctor...
[01:25:58.159 --> 01:26:01.220]  I feel like I'm having a heart attack.
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:06.739]  The doctor is going to run a specific set of tests to get to what is actually happening.
[01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:08.319]  He has to know the truth.
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:13.479]  He can't do medical procedures upon me based upon what I tell him I feel.
[01:26:13.659 --> 01:26:15.180]  He has to know for a fact.
[01:26:15.279 --> 01:26:16.739]  He has to know what he's talking about.
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.000]  So he has to do a battery test.
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:23.300]  He has to do a test because if he does the wrong treatment to me based upon what I feel, he could kill me.
[01:26:24.130 --> 01:26:27.409]  And he's right. There's no evidence to support that Trump is racist at all.
[01:26:27.489 --> 01:26:30.630]  In fact, he was the first president to come into office pro-gay marriage.
[01:26:30.810 --> 01:26:36.869]  The most progressive president to ever enter the office in terms of social issues specifically.
[01:26:37.449 --> 01:26:39.350]  Because he's not a Republican or a Democrat.
[01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:40.369]  He's a populist.
[01:26:40.449 --> 01:26:45.229]  And the more corrupt our government becomes, the more populist our people become in response.
[01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:53.890]  The more obvious it is that all of our problems are because of a political class that exploits and undermines the interests, wants and needs of a working class.
[01:26:54.029 --> 01:26:55.310]  Of an American class.
[01:26:55.729 --> 01:26:58.970]  Of the people. That's all populism means.
[01:26:59.229 --> 01:27:08.970]  All populism means is that we should emphasize policies that benefit the people more than empower and benefit those within the political class.
[01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:12.890]  It's very simple. And there's right-wing populism and there's left-wing populism.
[01:27:13.090 --> 01:27:17.869]  There's libertarian populism, which is probably akin to what we've been preaching on this network for 30 years.
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:23.939]  Yes, it leans more right than left because the leftists are always about expanding government.
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:35.880]  Whether it's Marxism directly or communism or socialism or any other form of democratic socialism or mixed economy, the left obviously advocates and always advocates for more government in one form or another.
[01:27:36.159 --> 01:27:44.359]  Though they may advocate for different means to that end, that is the end and therefore it is inherently anti-populist because more government means less power to the people.
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:51.949]  They want to Create an unbalance, an imbalance between the power of the government and the power of the people.
[01:27:52.130 --> 01:28:07.369]  They want the famous statue of justice to be totally disproportionate in their favor so they can rig the game just like they rig so many elections, just like they rig the thoughts that we have through their narrative control, through traditional legacy media outlets,
[01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:24.579]  through corporate media. I mean,
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:28.239]  do you honestly think that there's a difference between big pharma and big government?
[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:41.979]  When so much of the money that goes to these pharmaceutical companies comes directly from the federal government, so much of the research that goes into the development of their drugs comes directly from the federal government through our universities, through our academia.
[01:28:42.279 --> 01:29:11.000]  They are laundering political influence We're good to go.
[01:29:11.029 --> 01:29:15.090]  Our problems don't come from Elon Musk being rich.
[01:29:15.449 --> 01:29:17.850]  No one is poor because Elon Musk is a billionaire.
[01:29:18.289 --> 01:29:28.289]  Our problems come from a government that is so powerful, so influential, that these major corporations have to play ball with these deep state institutions in order to stay operational.
[01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:39.630]  Every time an Elizabeth Warren comes out and threatens to invoke antitrust laws against Google and split it up or Facebook and split it up, that makes these executives, these boards of directors, shake in their britches.
[01:29:40.079 --> 01:29:52.039]  They blamed Mark Zuckerberg in 2016 for Donald Trump's victory because of Cambridge Analytica when there was absolutely no evidence whatsoever to say that Cambridge Analytica had any meaningful impact on the election outcome.
[01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:59.000]  He was so scared that he testified in a suit for one of the first times I ever really saw him in a suit in front of Congress and he said, thank you, Senator.
[01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:00.720]  Senator, respectfully, respectfully, Senator.
[01:30:00.939 --> 01:30:16.670]  He was so scared of them that he buckled and ever since 2016 we've seen nothing but censorship and obedience from these major tech corporations We're good to go.
[01:30:17.109 --> 01:30:28.850]  We're good to go.
[01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:36.470]  Unless he was worried that the government had the power to threaten the integrity and sovereignty of his business, then I suppose yes.
[01:30:37.069 --> 01:30:51.670]  But as soon as these companies go public, whether it's Facebook or YouTube or Google or Meta or Apple, they get a board of directors and every person that sits on a board of directors for a major corporation is an avenue in for the deep state to compromise.
[01:30:53.050 --> 01:31:08.270]  Look what the Apple board of directors did to Steve Jobs, kicking him out of his own company, firing him from his own company, and then over the next years, almost driving itself into bankruptcy until they had to beg him to come back and give him autonomy as a leader.
[01:31:08.489 --> 01:31:11.869]  And then he saved the company, developed the iPod, developed the iPhone.
[01:31:14.819 --> 01:31:17.020]  This is the direction we have to go.
[01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:19.979]  We have to go toward laissez-faire capitalism, not away from it.
[01:31:20.279 --> 01:31:35.239]  We have to turn our cheek, turn our sight away from this claim that there's something to be said for fractional reserve banking or mixed economies when every single injustice that has ever happened has been because of government influence on private sector.
[01:31:36.050 --> 01:31:39.930]  And you have the left come out and say that monopolies would be a major problem in a laissez-faire capitalism.
[01:31:40.210 --> 01:31:46.750]  Name one monopoly in the history of the United States of America that wasn't sponsored, funded, or backed by the federal government itself.
[01:31:46.810 --> 01:31:51.569]  All the way from Rockefeller through Ford, through any of these big tech companies, they are all in bed with the government.
[01:31:51.609 --> 01:32:04.989]  I cannot think of a single individual who has successfully claimed a monopoly on any industry, good or service, that was not backed directly by the federal government in multiple ways to the tune of millions upon millions, if not billions of billions of dollars.
[01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:09.779]  It's absolutely unbelievable to me.
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:19.199]  And then you have the Bruce Springsteens in clip number 25 come out and suggest in their diner, despite the fact that they're worth millions upon millions of dollars.
[01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:23.399]  They're sitting in a diner like they're a blue-collar, working-class union guy.
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:26.880]  You got the assistant mayor coming out and making these comments.
[01:32:27.039 --> 01:32:28.300]  What an idiot.
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:32.850]  Clip number 25. Hi, I'm Bruce Springsteen.
[01:32:33.329 --> 01:32:38.329]  Friends, fans, and the press have asked me who I'm supporting in this most important of elections.
[01:32:39.149 --> 01:32:45.930]  And with full knowledge of my opinions no more or less important than those of any of my fellow citizens, here's my answer.
[01:32:46.979 --> 01:32:54.300]  I'm supporting Kamala Harris for president and Tim Walts for vice president and opposing Donald Trump and J.D. Vance.
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:33:01.899]  Here's why. We are shortly coming upon one of the most consequential elections in our nation's history.
[01:33:02.279 --> 01:33:11.460]  Perhaps not since the Civil War has this great country felt as politically, spiritually and emotionally divided as it does then at this moment.
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:13.779]  It doesn't have to be this way.
[01:33:14.989 --> 01:33:24.350]  The common values, the shared stories that make us a great and united nation are waiting to be rediscovered and retold once again.
[01:33:24.930 --> 01:33:34.770]  Now that will take time, hard work, intelligence, faith, and women and men with the national good guiding their hearts.
[01:33:35.529 --> 01:33:47.289]  America's the most powerful nation on earth, not just because of her overwhelming military strength or economic power, but because of what she stands for, what she means, what she believes in.
[01:33:47.609 --> 01:33:54.729]  Freedom, social justice, equal opportunity, the right to be and love who you want.
[01:33:54.930 --> 01:33:57.189]  These are the things that make America great.
[01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:03.840]  Donald Trump is the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:18.939]  His disdain for the sanctity of our Constitution, the sanctity of democracy, the sanctity of the rule of law, and the sanctity of the peaceful transfer of power should disqualify him from the office of president.
[01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:29.699]  All right, folks, looks like we have Eric Trump approaching the podium right now.
[01:34:30.119 --> 01:34:32.300]  We're gonna go to him and let you hear from the son of the president.
[01:34:32.359 --> 01:34:38.859]  I've never been more proud to be anywhere in my life than I am today here with you on this stage.
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:46.220]  This is a big family.
[01:34:48.279 --> 01:34:52.039]  They tried to take away someone we all love.
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:55.460]  And they did take away someone we love.
[01:34:56.340 --> 01:34:58.560]  And Cory, an incredible man.
[01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:00.579]  His family's backstage.
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:02.699]  It's heartbreaking.
[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:08.439]  It's heartbreaking. They've tried to get my father every single second since he went down that golden escalator.
[01:35:08.579 --> 01:35:11.920]  Laura and I have witnessed it every single day.
[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:14.979]  They tried to smear us.
[01:35:15.239 --> 01:35:17.060]  They tried to bankrupt us.
[01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:18.859]  They came after us.
[01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:20.859]  They impeached him twice.
[01:35:21.279 --> 01:35:24.000]  They went after his Supreme Court justices.
[01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:26.220]  They weaponized the entire legal system.
[01:35:26.859 --> 01:35:28.420]  The Russia hoax.
[01:35:28.939 --> 01:35:30.159]  The dirty dossiers.
[01:35:30.699 --> 01:35:32.859]  You remember every single one of them.
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:41.060]  Far-left AGs, far-left DAs in every far-left place in this country went after my father.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.399]  They tried to pull him off the ballot in Colorado.
[01:35:44.399 --> 01:35:48.300]  They tried to pull him off the ballot in Maine.
[01:35:49.439 --> 01:35:51.560]  And it has not worked.
[01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:01.319]  And then, guys, they tried to kill him.
[01:36:01.579 --> 01:36:03.100]  They tried to kill him.
[01:36:03.989 --> 01:36:07.890]  And it's because the Democratic Party, they can't do anything right.
[01:36:08.130 --> 01:36:09.609]  They can't do anything right.
[01:36:09.869 --> 01:36:16.789]  You see it this week in the FEMA response in North Carolina, and in Georgia, and in South Carolina, and in Florida.
[01:36:19.130 --> 01:36:22.329]  You have people's houses floating down rivers.
[01:36:22.869 --> 01:36:24.350]  And what does Kamala do?
[01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:27.270]  She comes out and says, yes, I'd like to give that family $750.
[01:36:27.630 --> 01:36:38.619]  Wow. We sent $200 billion over to Ukraine so beautiful young kids can shoot at each other in trenches.
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:41.720]  $200 billion.
[01:36:42.319 --> 01:36:45.380]  We give hundreds of billions of dollars to Pakistan.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:54.319]  They wouldn't tell us that Bin Laden was literally a mile away from their equivalent of West Point.
[01:36:55.289 --> 01:36:57.829]  We send hundreds of billions of dollars to them.
[01:36:57.909 --> 01:37:03.289]  We gave $150 billion to Iran, a country that chants, death to America.
[01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:14.449]  And Kamala Harris comes out and says, we're going to give $750 to the person who lost their house in a mudslide.
[01:37:14.989 --> 01:37:18.130]  Guys, this isn't America first, this is America last.
[01:37:19.569 --> 01:37:23.229]  But the good news, help is on the way.
[01:37:28.869 --> 01:37:33.510]  And help is on the way from the bravest person I have ever met in my entire life.
[01:37:35.649 --> 01:37:39.069]  My father's been the greatest father a person could ever have.
[01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:42.369]  He's been an inspiration to this entire country.
[01:37:42.750 --> 01:37:50.710]  And he was an inspiration here in Butler when he stood up with blood running down his face and said, fight, fight, fight!
[01:38:02.609 --> 01:38:03.989]  I love all of you so much.
[01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:05.510]  I really mean it. This is a family.
[01:38:05.630 --> 01:38:06.829]  This isn't politics, guys.
[01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:24.770]  Guys, this isn't politics.
[01:38:25.170 --> 01:38:39.409]  This isn't politics. This is a movement of absolute love Of hundreds of millions of people who want to save the United States, who want to keep our country number one at absolutely everything we do.
[01:38:42.770 --> 01:38:50.529]  And that's why we're going to re-elect Donald Trump as the 47th President of the United States.
[01:38:50.710 --> 01:38:51.729]  Guys, we love you.
[01:38:52.130 --> 01:39:02.060]  And to a woman that is doing a truly great job in every aspect of life, From being a great wife to an unbelievable mother.
[01:39:02.899 --> 01:39:06.060]  By the way, I think Caroline and Luke Trump are the most popular Trumps right now.
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:07.439]  Did you guys see them a couple weeks ago?
[01:39:08.199 --> 01:39:11.420]  Vote for Grandpa. Make America great again.
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:16.039]  But she's doing a hell of a job as the RNC co-chair.
[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:24.350]  You know, I get to go to bed every single night and wake up every single morning listening to Listening about voter integrity, it's really great.
[01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:30.149]  I'm really, really excited for November 6th when Laura can turn over in the morning and not talk about voter integrity.
[01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:33.149]  But she's doing a hell of a job.
[01:39:33.250 --> 01:39:34.449]  Ladies and gentlemen, Laura Trump.
[01:39:39.010 --> 01:39:40.470]  All right, Pennsylvania.
[01:39:43.869 --> 01:39:50.229]  Is anybody here ready to send Donald J. Trump back to the White House?
[01:39:55.689 --> 01:39:58.649]  Well, we're 31 days away.
[01:39:58.890 --> 01:40:05.729]  One month from right now, as Donald Trump always says, will be the most important day in the history of America.
[01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:09.229]  Because this is a pivotal moment for our country.
[01:40:09.550 --> 01:40:11.529]  And I don't even have to tell anybody that here.
[01:40:11.609 --> 01:40:12.810]  We can all feel it.
[01:40:13.210 --> 01:40:19.390]  This is no longer a fight between Republican versus Democrat, left versus right.
[01:40:19.630 --> 01:40:21.949]  It is good versus evil.
[01:40:23.579 --> 01:40:27.420]  And good is going to win this battle, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:31.039 --> 01:40:40.520]  And if you had any question whether God exists and he performs miracles, we got our answer here on July 13th, right here in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:48.039]  He spared Donald Trump's life.
[01:40:48.789 --> 01:40:51.930]  Because he was not finished with Donald Trump.
[01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:55.310]  And he did it not once, but twice.
[01:40:56.289 --> 01:41:00.510]  And I've said it time and time again, but now you feel it more than ever.
[01:41:00.850 --> 01:41:05.329]  Donald Trump was made for such a time as this.
[01:41:10.979 --> 01:41:31.119]  It's such an honor to be back here in Butler and you know I knew before Donald Trump even said he wanted to come back here that he would come back to Butler, Pennsylvania because in life you can operate with fear and cowardice or you can operate with strength and faith and that's what Donald Trump operates with,
[01:41:31.359 --> 01:41:36.380]  strength and faith and that's the kind of leader we need to see back at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
[01:41:36.539 --> 01:41:38.460]  We need strength in this country.
[01:41:44.329 --> 01:41:57.550]  And Eric's right. I've been doing a little something with making sure that we have free, fair and transparent elections and that only legal citizens are voting in our elections here in the United States of America.
[01:41:57.810 --> 01:42:09.399]  That's okay. It's been the number one focus of the RNC since I took over alongside our chairman Michael Watley back in March.
[01:42:09.899 --> 01:42:18.340]  We have had a big goal of recruiting 100,000 people to volunteer as poll watchers, poll workers, legal experts on the ground.
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:20.279]  And we said, I don't know, 100,000 is a lot.
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:27.579]  I'm happy to report that we have trained 200,000 people across this country to do that.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.760]  So our message is very clear.
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:43.539]  If you are a person who is considering cheating in our elections, we will find you, we will track you down, and we will prosecute you to the full extent of the law.
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:54.300]  And if you're an illegal citizen voting in our election, we'll track you down and prosecute you to the full extent of the law, and you're leaving this country.
[01:42:54.539 --> 01:42:57.220]  How's that sound? Don't do it.
[01:42:57.359 --> 01:43:05.270]  It's not worth it. But real quick, before I go, is everybody in this crowd registered to vote?
[01:43:08.810 --> 01:43:15.630]  Well, it could be that you've heard of someone who's been doing so much voter registration right here in Pennsylvania.
[01:43:16.590 --> 01:43:18.649]  His name is Scott Pressler.
[01:43:22.149 --> 01:43:25.829]  And he has done an incredible job.
[01:43:28.239 --> 01:43:35.880]  We have flipped Bucks County and Luzerne County from Democrat to Republican in terms of voter registration.
[01:43:37.699 --> 01:43:47.300]  And I would like to invite my friend Scott Pressler to come up and say a few words to you folks, if you would welcome him, please, to the stage right now.
[01:43:54.369 --> 01:43:57.710]  They're absolutely freaking out about Pennsylvania and these swing states.
[01:43:57.890 --> 01:44:00.109]  And he wore shorts for us today, so check out his legs.
[01:44:00.189 --> 01:44:01.670]  Look at this. Yes!
[01:44:05.229 --> 01:44:06.310]  They know they're not going to win.
[01:44:06.369 --> 01:44:13.189]  That's why they keep trying to kill him. I wish I didn't wear shorts today.
[01:44:15.289 --> 01:44:22.050]  Mom and Dad, I honor you on the stage today, Captain Robert Pressler and my mom, Carol Pressler.
[01:44:27.439 --> 01:44:31.699]  Pennsylvania, you have the power to change the world.
[01:44:32.279 --> 01:44:34.140]  Pennsylvania wins the White House.
[01:44:34.319 --> 01:44:38.300]  And so please, I ask you today, please check your voter status.
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:42.739]  Make sure you're an active voter registered at your current address.
[01:44:43.119 --> 01:44:48.659]  And please visit vote.pa.gov and register to vote today.
[01:44:49.859 --> 01:44:51.560]  A message...
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:55.539]  To our union workers, we want your vote.
[01:44:55.779 --> 01:44:58.220]  We want to keep jobs here in America.
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:19.140]  To our beautiful Amish and Lancaster and across the state, we will protect your raw milk, your dairy, your farming, your school choice, your religious freedom, your ability to afford to have 10 beautiful children per family.
[01:45:22.029 --> 01:45:25.550]  To our hunters, 30% of you are not registered to vote.
[01:45:25.789 --> 01:45:28.649]  Please, our hunters, support the Second Amendment.
[01:45:28.949 --> 01:45:36.729]  Register to vote. To our truckers that service us every single day, please request a mail-in ballot or vote early.
[01:45:36.909 --> 01:45:37.930]  Lock in those votes.
[01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:42.770]  To our sorority sisters and our fraternity brothers, please, you have the power.
[01:45:42.770 --> 01:45:49.210]  If you're going to school here in Pennsylvania, register to vote legally and lawfully here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
[01:45:50.649 --> 01:45:54.310]  I feel this from the top of my head to the tip of my toes.
[01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:56.909]  I love our great country.
[01:45:57.250 --> 01:45:58.949]  President Trump...
[01:45:58.949 --> 01:46:04.170]  President Trump took a bullet for us.
[01:46:04.729 --> 01:46:14.930]  Please use your ballot and have his back on Tuesday, November 5th, and deliver Pennsylvania for Donald J. Trump!
[01:46:16.109 --> 01:46:17.210]  Thank you.
[01:46:21.159 --> 01:46:35.140]  Thank you. All right, before we go, what we're going to do here today, ladies and gentlemen, is we're going to make a new memory in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:41.020]  And this will mark the moment that this election was won for Donald J. Trump.
[01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:43.439]  Let's send him back to the White House on November 5th.
[01:46:43.579 --> 01:46:44.840]  We love you, Pennsylvania.
[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:46.739]  Thank you. God bless.
[01:46:48.819 --> 01:46:51.100]  And they know that they're going to lose, the leftists.
[01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:52.420]  And they are panicking.
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:55.260]  We've seen this for weeks and weeks and months and months.
[01:46:55.359 --> 01:46:58.300]  We've seen their level of desperation do nothing but escalate.
[01:46:58.359 --> 01:46:59.399]  I want to show you clip number one.
[01:46:59.819 --> 01:47:06.239]  Here's Kamala Harris just cackling as she panics about the next 30 days of this election.
[01:47:06.399 --> 01:47:10.520]  Clip number one. Remember his number, 32!
[01:47:11.939 --> 01:47:14.560]  Today we got 32 days until the election!
[01:47:22.869 --> 01:47:24.850]  So 32 days.
[01:47:25.909 --> 01:47:27.489]  32 days.
[01:47:28.329 --> 01:47:29.850]  Okay, we got some business to do.
[01:47:30.029 --> 01:47:31.109]  We got some business to do.
[01:47:31.729 --> 01:47:34.390]  All right. 32 days.
[01:47:34.989 --> 01:47:38.310]  And we know we will do it.
[01:47:43.069 --> 01:47:48.779]  And... And this is going to be a very tight race until the very end.
[01:47:49.119 --> 01:47:52.699]  This is going to be a very tight race until the very end.
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:57.000]  We are the underdog and we know we have some hard work ahead.
[01:47:59.659 --> 01:48:01.399]  Alright, folks. Well, she's panicking.
[01:48:01.539 --> 01:48:04.619]  She's cackling. We're going to take a quick break before Trump joins the stage.
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:11.260]  Let's go ahead and run the AI ad that was made for the AlexJonesStore.com.

[01:49:29.689 --> 01:49:36.409]  Stay tuned. We will be covering Trump speaking any moment at the historic rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.
[01:49:38.329 --> 01:49:40.189]  Hi, I'm Kamala Harris.
[01:49:40.710 --> 01:49:49.670]  When I'm elected president, platforms that promote free speech, truth, and resilience to the New World Order, like TheAlexJonesStore.com, will be banned.
[01:49:49.949 --> 01:49:54.890]  Sites that profit off dangerous truths are a threat to our democracy.
[01:49:55.210 --> 01:50:04.069]  Shirts sold at TheAlexJonesStore.com, like the InfoWars limited edition fundraiser t-shirt, will no longer be tolerated.
[01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:08.510]  And let's be clear. If you're caught wearing one of these shirts, you will face arrest.
[01:50:08.810 --> 01:50:20.409]  Whether it's the Alex Jones for President 2028 shirt or any other merchandise pushing harmful messages of patriotism, family, faith and freedom, this kind of propaganda has no place in our future.
[01:50:20.810 --> 01:50:24.550]  We will create a future where safety, censorship and tyranny prevail.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.100]  Don't go to thealexjonesstore.com to purchase products that keep Alex Jones on the air.
[01:50:31.340 --> 01:50:34.000]  Don't wear the shirts or support humanity.
[01:50:34.239 --> 01:50:37.920]  If you do, you'll be the first in line for my depopulation agenda.
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:42.239]  Now obviously that is AI satire of Kamala Harris.
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:43.760]  That's not really her.
[01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:50.539]  But if you look at her policies and what she supported and what big tech and the Democrats want and what Hillary Clinton has said.
[01:50:50.659 --> 01:50:56.380]  There are Americans who are engaged in this kind of propaganda.
[01:50:56.619 --> 01:51:05.119]  They are directly speaking to millions and millions of people without any level of oversight or regulation.
[01:51:05.569 --> 01:51:13.689]  Whether they should be civilly or even in some cases criminally charged is something that would be a better deterrent.
[01:51:13.869 --> 01:51:16.229]  There's no guarantee to free speech on misinformation.
[01:51:16.710 --> 01:51:20.109]  They indeed do want to put people in jail for their free speech.
[01:51:20.250 --> 01:51:28.289]  And the Justice Department that she's controlled by, that's hijacked this country, has been running the whole operation trying to shut down Infowars.
[01:51:28.489 --> 01:51:31.989]  And on November 13th, it goes up for auction.
[01:51:32.350 --> 01:51:34.970]  And the Democrats have said, they never wanted money from me.
[01:51:35.050 --> 01:51:36.130]  They wanted me silenced.
[01:51:36.449 --> 01:51:38.689]  That was always their goal.
[01:51:38.890 --> 01:51:43.229]  Take Alex Jones' platform that he talks about away.
[01:51:44.010 --> 01:51:47.250]  I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild.
[01:51:47.569 --> 01:51:53.970]  There's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the courts of Infowars and the bankruptcy estate.
[01:51:54.369 --> 01:51:57.729]  And over the course of that process, that could get very, very dangerous for Mr.
[01:51:57.890 --> 01:52:03.439]  Jones. I hope that we never see someone like him again.
[01:52:04.479 --> 01:52:14.619]  And if you're out there right now and you're one of Alex Jones' audience members and you're considering giving him money, I just want you to know that based on the jury's verdict today, it's not a very good bet.
[01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:25.340]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he can't do it again.
[01:52:26.250 --> 01:52:35.069]  They're scared of satire because real satire, powerful satire, takes a truth and then basically presents it to show how absurd it is.
[01:52:35.470 --> 01:52:48.680]  So I'm asking all of you for your support to fund the AlexJonesStore.com and get these great t-shirts and ball caps so one way or another, My broadcast continues on regardless of what happens.
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:54.960]  We may be able to get some patriots to outbid Soros and Media Matters for Infowars and this operation.
[01:52:55.140 --> 01:52:58.220]  But regardless, myself and the crew want to come roaring back.
[01:52:58.359 --> 01:53:01.439]  So support our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:53:01.779 --> 01:53:04.699]  Get these amazing shirts. That's how you keep us on air.
[01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:13.579]  And these shirts are so timely, launching the First Amendment and Second Amendment Defense League, standing up for the right of free speech and self-defense.
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:19.500]  This shirt and so many other amazing shirts, now available exclusively at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:20.760]  This is serious.
[01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:22.979]  This affects the entire country and the world.
[01:53:23.159 --> 01:53:26.439]  They're trying to get through me, as Trump says, to get to you.
[01:53:26.579 --> 01:53:27.739]  So please stand with us.
[01:53:27.899 --> 01:53:29.199]  I thank you all for your support.
[01:53:29.399 --> 01:53:33.399]  Plus, these are amazing shirts at thealexjonesstore.com.
[01:53:33.659 --> 01:53:38.880]  Please take action. All right, ladies, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:57.060]  We are back covering the historic return of President Donald Trump to Butler, Pennsylvania, the very venue in the very city, in the very state where an assassin attempted to take his life and successfully shot him, harming and even killing others on that historic day,
[01:53:57.199 --> 01:54:00.380]  July 13th, 2020, 24.
[01:54:01.079 --> 01:54:04.180]  2024. And...
[01:54:05.339 --> 01:54:08.979]  Look, July 13th was everything that they said January 6th was.
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:10.720]  It was an insurrection.
[01:54:10.899 --> 01:54:12.600]  It was an attempt to start a civil war.
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:15.720]  It was an attempt to just eliminate a political opponent.
[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:27.479]  We've seen countless rhetoric from them for years, but recently that would lead to such a persuasion among voters or citizens or people here in the country, whether legally or not.
[01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:36.220]  To have the audacity and the will and the desire to go out and commit such an act of violence on an individual, to violate his right with violence.
[01:54:36.340 --> 01:54:37.539]  They say that they're against violence.
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:40.760]  They say that they're all for gun reform and safety and things of that nature.
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:47.819]  But then there were countless people that were interviewed after that attempt on Donald Trump's life who explicitly said, I wish that he hadn't missed.
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:49.579]  I wish that Trump had died on that day.
[01:54:50.850 --> 01:54:56.170]  Even one member of Tenacious D on stage with Jack Black stated, don't miss Trump next time.
[01:54:56.289 --> 01:54:59.829]  People were joking about this, saying that they wished that this assassin had been successful.
[01:54:59.930 --> 01:55:02.670]  Let me tell you what, I hate Joe Biden with every bone in my body.
[01:55:02.970 --> 01:55:04.609]  I don't want him to be assassinated.
[01:55:04.869 --> 01:55:08.449]  I don't want him to be killed because I'm not an animal.
[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:11.060]  I'm not a violent person.
[01:55:11.319 --> 01:55:21.039]  Yes, anybody who is alive today does have the code installed in their DNA. They are hardwired to be capable of violence when faced with a serious threat.
[01:55:21.539 --> 01:55:36.130]  We are all designed and capable of extreme violence in extreme circumstances But the motive and mission of this very network itself is to prevent such circumstances from manifesting ever again, especially here in the United States of America.
[01:55:36.289 --> 01:55:40.869]  We are a network and establishment that aims to prevent war of any kind at all costs.
[01:55:41.050 --> 01:55:44.409]  Because every time there is a war, it seems to escalate to another war.
[01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:47.689]  And there cannot be a one-world government without another world war.
[01:55:48.380 --> 01:55:51.300]  After World War I, we saw globalization through the League of Nations.
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:56.180]  After World War II, we saw further globalization through NATO and the United Nations.
[01:55:56.359 --> 01:56:03.899]  And now they want to institute World War III so they can finally bring in the final strike that will establish one world government.
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:05.840]  That's what globalism is.
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:12.420]  It is when the political class of the world conspires amongst itself to sell out their various individual constituents.
[01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:14.359]  It is the eradication of all borders.
[01:56:14.579 --> 01:56:18.560]  It is the eradication of national sovereignty as a principle itself.
[01:56:19.890 --> 01:56:24.050]  Because national sovereignty is inherently a threat to political power.
[01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:26.970]  And those in political power only want two things.
[01:56:27.149 --> 01:56:31.010]  One, to maintain their power, and two, to expand their power.
[01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:35.729]  That is why globalism, in my opinion, is the greatest threat to humanity itself.
[01:56:35.970 --> 01:56:46.810]  It leads to every crisis, to every war, to every conflict, to every disaster, to every deep state, secret organization, element of our government that's totally unchecked and unaccountable.
[01:56:47.949 --> 01:56:50.229]  It leads to every injustice on any people.
[01:56:51.010 --> 01:56:56.310]  It is globalism itself that is responsible for all the injustices that we have faced for the last 50 years.
[01:56:56.430 --> 01:57:06.909]  It is globalism itself that is responsible for all the injustices that Alex Jones has faced, that his family has faced, and that we, the crew at Infowars, have faced over the last several years as well.
[01:57:07.590 --> 01:57:11.170]  Because the truth is a threat to the lies, to the dishonesty.
[01:57:11.350 --> 01:57:18.680]  The truth is a threat to To everything that these globalists stand for.
[01:57:19.479 --> 01:57:24.199]  And many people have criticized Trump repeatedly over Operation Warp Speed.
[01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:27.920]  Operation Warp Speed is one of my least favorite aspects of the Trump administration.
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:29.939]  It turned out to be very dangerous.
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:33.579]  But certainly obvious that Trump isn't responsible for the mandates.
[01:57:33.979 --> 01:57:38.939]  And Trump isn't responsible for the harms of this vaccine.
[01:57:39.479 --> 01:57:41.319]  And he's defended himself this week.
[01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:42.760]  He said this week...
[01:57:43.699 --> 01:57:46.079]  That he would imprison those, fire those.
[01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:48.220]  Frankly, he said, well, fire their asses.
[01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:50.920]  Trump vows to hold military mandate pushers accountable.
[01:57:51.199 --> 01:58:02.199]  And now he's entering the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, to speak again in this historic moment, the very place where he was shot just months ago on July 13th, 2024.
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:59:45.550]  Let's go to him. The men who died who gave that right to me And I gladly stand up next to you And defend her still today Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land God bless the USA From the lakes of Minnesota To the hills of Tennessee Across the plains of Texas From sea to shining sea From Detroit down to Houston And New York to L.A. There's pride in every American heart And it's time we stand and say Be an American where at least I know I'm free And I won't forget the men who died who gave that right to me And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land God bless the USA Sing it!
[01:59:46.010 --> 02:01:25.420]  God, I'm proud to be an American Where at least I know I'm free And I won't forget the men who died Who gave that right to me And I gladly stand up Next to you and defend her still today Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land God bless you Lee,
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:27.039]  thank you very much, really.
[02:01:27.220 --> 02:01:31.279]  And thank you, a very big thank you to Pennsylvania.
[02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:38.380]  We love Pennsylvania. And as I was saying...
[02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:47.680]  They got the chart that saved his life on the screen, folks.
[02:01:48.199 --> 02:01:49.439]  Unbelievable. Oh, I love that.
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:51.300]  I love that chart.
[02:01:51.460 --> 02:01:52.880]  I love that graph.
[02:01:53.689 --> 02:01:55.170]  Isn't it a beautiful thing?
[02:01:55.329 --> 02:01:57.390]  But also beautiful because look at the number.
[02:01:57.550 --> 02:01:58.949]  That's the day I left office.
[02:01:59.189 --> 02:02:04.470]  It was the lowest border patrol, the lowest it's ever been, illegal immigration.
[02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:05.869]  Today it's out of control.
[02:02:06.090 --> 02:02:08.329]  But I love it for other reasons, too.
[02:02:08.510 --> 02:02:10.850]  You know that. So thank you very much.
[02:02:10.989 --> 02:02:13.970]  And thank Lee and what Lee has done with that song.
[02:02:14.130 --> 02:02:16.430]  And it's such an honor to have it.
[02:02:16.989 --> 02:02:18.029]  I want to...
[02:02:18.829 --> 02:02:29.750]  Just to let you know that tonight I return to Butler in the aftermath of tragedy and heartache to deliver a simple message to the people of Pennsylvania and to the people of America.
[02:02:30.609 --> 02:02:40.569]  Our movement to make America great again stands stronger, prouder, more united, more determined, and nearer to victory than ever before.
[02:02:40.750 --> 02:02:42.770]  We're going to make America great again.
[02:02:43.350 --> 02:02:44.789]  Gonna win the election.
[02:02:45.029 --> 02:02:57.180]  Gonna win the election. And to all Americans, whether you are Republican, Democrat, independent, conservative or liberal, or you have no label whatsoever, it makes no difference.
[02:02:57.319 --> 02:02:59.180]  Our movement, it belongs to you.
[02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:00.619]  It belongs to our country.
[02:03:01.699 --> 02:03:03.000]  Belongs to our country.
[02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:16.819]  And together, in just one month, we are going to usher in a new golden age of American security, prosperity, sovereignty, and freedom for our citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.
[02:03:20.899 --> 02:03:33.279]  Exactly 12 weeks ago this evening, on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me and to silence the greatest movement, MAGA, in the history of our country.
[02:03:33.380 --> 02:03:48.520]  MAGA. We love MAGA. For 16 harrowing seconds during the gunfire, time stopped as this vicious monster unleashed pure evil from his sniper's perch,
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:50.199]  not so far away.
[02:03:51.060 --> 02:04:00.100]  But by the hand of providence and the grace of God, that villain did not succeed in his goal, did not come close.
[02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:04.039]  He did not stop our movement.
[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:06.159]  He did not break out our spirit.
[02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:14.039]  He did not shake our unyielding resolve to save America from evils of poverty, hatred, and destruction.
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:17.359]  Yet we are here this evening in record numbers.
[02:04:17.359 --> 02:04:19.140]  This is a big crowd.
[02:04:19.439 --> 02:04:20.739]  This is a big crowd.
[02:04:21.970 --> 02:04:23.369]  This is a big one.
[02:04:25.050 --> 02:04:40.960]  Not only to mark the triumph of American spirit, But over, and you know that this is really, truly, in the truest sense, spirit over evil and adversity, but also to pay tribute to some of the best and bravest we have ever known.
[02:04:41.319 --> 02:04:55.939]  This field is now a monument to the valor of our first responders, to the resilience of our fellow citizens, and to the sacrifice of a loving and devoted father, a really great man.
[02:04:55.939 --> 02:05:01.850]  You know that. Forever afterward.
[02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:20.869]  Forever after.
[02:05:21.859 --> 02:05:37.739]  All who have visited this hallowed place will remember what happened here, and they will know of the character and courage that so many incredible American patriots have showed and know, and they know it at a level never seen before,
[02:05:37.899 --> 02:05:43.939]  probably. First, I want to thank the men and women of the U.S. Secret Service who threw their bodies on top of mine.
[02:05:48.319 --> 02:05:53.020]  Without even a thought for their own lives, they were on top of me so fast.
[02:05:53.720 --> 02:05:58.680]  They were on top of me, and there was not even a moment of doubt in their minds.
[02:05:58.779 --> 02:06:00.960]  You watch those tapes, not even a moment of doubt.
[02:06:01.079 --> 02:06:02.359]  I want to thank Secret Service.
[02:06:02.579 --> 02:06:04.039]  They're great, great people.
[02:06:04.239 --> 02:06:18.829]  They are great people. And in that moment, those agents displayed a devotion to duty that cannot be described, and they did it yet again less than three weeks ago when they really did a fantastic job.
[02:06:18.909 --> 02:06:20.970]  Another attempt. It was another attempt.
[02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:24.109]  We have an evil world. We have a very sick world.
[02:06:24.590 --> 02:06:26.949]  My gratitude to them is beyond measure.
[02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:35.489]  We also owe a tremendous debt thanks to the Secret Service counter-sniper and a local police sniper.
[02:06:39.619 --> 02:06:45.899]  Who returned fire within seconds and stopped the shooter quickly and saved many lives.
[02:06:46.140 --> 02:06:47.899]  If he didn't stop, he saved many lives.
[02:06:48.079 --> 02:06:51.039]  He had a lot of bullets, a lot of ammunition up there with him.
[02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:52.779]  And we are...
[02:06:53.710 --> 02:06:59.930]  I mean, just amazing when you think they did it so quickly, without any knowledge of what was going on, boom.
[02:07:00.569 --> 02:07:03.350]  And had that not happened, it would have been a very different story.
[02:07:03.470 --> 02:07:06.069]  It would have been many, many, potentially many, many people.
[02:07:06.369 --> 02:07:12.289]  I also want to express our thanks to the Butler Township Police Department, incredible people.
[02:07:15.329 --> 02:07:31.029]  The Butler Sheriff's deputies, Pennsylvania State Police, and all of the other law enforcement heroes, as well as the emergency personnel and doctors, the medical teams at Butler Memorial Hospital, Allegheny General Hospital,
[02:07:31.170 --> 02:07:35.970]  who rushed me and rushed some of these very badly wounded people.
[02:07:36.090 --> 02:07:37.810]  They were wounded, a lot of...
[02:07:38.399 --> 02:07:43.880]  A lot of badly wounded people, in particular, two people.
[02:07:44.140 --> 02:07:49.439]  Two people. And I tell you, they were very brave and great people.
[02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:51.560]  They were big Trump fans, and they still are.
[02:07:51.819 --> 02:07:55.560]  That means something. That was pretty amazing.
[02:07:55.739 --> 02:08:00.300]  You know, when I got up, I asked whether or not anybody was killed.
[02:08:00.359 --> 02:08:04.279]  I assumed that there would be a lot, because I heard the bullets winging right over my head.
[02:08:04.359 --> 02:08:05.460]  They said, probably three.
[02:08:05.579 --> 02:08:07.600]  The doctors did such an incredible job.
[02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:10.380]  It was one. One great gentleman.
[02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:14.600]  The other two have been amazing, actually.
[02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:16.520]  They've gone through it. They've gone through a lot.
[02:08:17.399 --> 02:08:22.920]  And when the crisis struck, they did really Pennsylvania proud.
[02:08:23.079 --> 02:08:25.279]  You've heard that expression, Pennsylvania proud.
[02:08:25.399 --> 02:08:28.659]  It's a great place. I went to school.
[02:08:28.939 --> 02:08:30.399]  I went to college in Pennsylvania.
[02:08:30.399 --> 02:08:31.500]  It's a great place.
[02:08:32.130 --> 02:08:33.369]  The people are incredible.
[02:08:33.630 --> 02:08:48.369]  Also, and I have to say, after returning to the field tonight, is one of the really brave Americans who was hit by the assassin's bullet, U.S. Marine veteran David Dutch.
[02:08:48.710 --> 02:08:51.170]  David, thank you. Thank you, David.
[02:08:52.710 --> 02:08:53.789]  Thank you, David.
[02:08:55.930 --> 02:08:59.630]  And, David, we're thrilled to see your recovery is going well.
[02:09:00.489 --> 02:09:01.649]  Great doctors up here.
[02:09:01.789 --> 02:09:03.189]  I have to tell you, great doctors.
[02:09:03.829 --> 02:09:06.550]  Your courage is really an inspiration to us all.
[02:09:06.649 --> 02:09:08.250]  So I want to thank you very much, David.
[02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:10.609]  Great gentleman.
[02:09:11.149 --> 02:09:12.310]  Great, great gentleman.
[02:09:12.649 --> 02:09:21.949]  I want to send our love to someone who could not be here because he has just undergone a major surgery related to the shooting.
[02:09:22.289 --> 02:09:25.369]  A man who was really badly wounded.
[02:09:26.210 --> 02:09:29.250]  Like David, James Copenhaer.
[02:09:30.149 --> 02:09:35.250]  Because James was a wonderful man, a big Trump fan.
[02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:40.310]  And Mr.
[02:09:40.729 --> 02:09:41.949]  Copenhaer is out there.
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:49.239]  Watching us right now, but he's in a hospital where they did some additional work, but he's in great shape.
[02:09:49.399 --> 02:09:56.819]  He wanted to be here so badly, but he's in great shape, and we appreciate it, and we're looking to his full and complete recovery.
[02:09:56.819 --> 02:09:58.479]  He will have a complete recovery.
[02:10:00.079 --> 02:10:03.340]  Thank you. Thank you very much.
[02:10:04.079 --> 02:10:25.000]  And of course, there's one more hero who could not make it back here tonight because he is no longer We all miss him.
[02:10:25.220 --> 02:10:27.979]  He's become somewhat of a folk hero, I have to tell you.
[02:10:28.100 --> 02:10:35.460]  Who is with us is his beautiful wife and daughters and relatives, sister.
[02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:48.409]  Please. Where are you?
[02:10:48.729 --> 02:10:49.989]  Where are they sitting?
[02:10:55.069 --> 02:10:57.069]  There they are. There's a lot of people.
[02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:59.869]  It's not easy to find people in this audience.
[02:11:00.170 --> 02:11:02.390]  It goes back further than you can see.
[02:11:03.329 --> 02:11:04.550]  Thank you very much.
[02:11:04.689 --> 02:11:07.729]  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
[02:11:07.989 --> 02:11:10.909]  Great family. Great, incredible family.
[02:11:11.569 --> 02:11:13.750]  And he loved you a lot.
[02:11:15.290 --> 02:11:17.869]  And, you know, his wife said something very beautiful.
[02:11:18.050 --> 02:11:25.149]  The public, a lot of people, all of us, a lot of people have been very generous and she said, I'd rather have my husband.
[02:11:25.710 --> 02:11:27.109]  That's a good thing to say.
[02:11:27.810 --> 02:11:29.369]  That's a good thing to say.
[02:11:30.130 --> 02:11:31.630]  I'd rather have my husband.
[02:11:34.809 --> 02:11:45.449]  Cory Comparator was an incredible husband and father, a devout Christian, a veteran, and a proud former fire chief, very respected within the town.
[02:11:45.590 --> 02:11:51.210]  Everybody knew him. Few men volunteered to run into fires, but Cory was one of those who did.
[02:11:51.329 --> 02:11:52.369]  He ran into fires.
[02:11:52.529 --> 02:11:55.550]  I spoke to people that were, this guy would do anything.
[02:11:55.829 --> 02:11:57.510]  He was brave, right?
[02:11:57.630 --> 02:11:58.810]  A brave guy like you.
[02:11:59.899 --> 02:12:05.800]  And he was also a protector who put his life on the line for others, and he loved doing it.
[02:12:06.039 --> 02:12:15.039]  And when the sound of gunshots pierced the air on that July evening, Corey leapt into the fire one more time.
[02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:20.739]  In his last seconds on this earth, he threw himself on the top of his wife and daughters.
[02:12:20.819 --> 02:12:22.760]  He didn't want them hurt. He threw himself.
[02:12:22.899 --> 02:12:24.340]  He said he knew what was happening.
[02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:26.579]  He didn't want them hurt.
[02:12:28.729 --> 02:12:29.970]  And he was hit hard.
[02:12:30.210 --> 02:12:35.510]  He was hit hard. And he gave his life to shield their lives.
[02:12:35.729 --> 02:12:42.529]  Every father and husband in America hopes that if the time came, we would have what Corey had.
[02:12:42.890 --> 02:12:47.149]  Tremendous courage, tremendous guts, and he wanted to protect his family.
[02:12:47.310 --> 02:12:49.329]  And he did protect his family.
[02:12:49.649 --> 02:12:52.590]  At this time, it is 6-11.
[02:12:53.500 --> 02:13:01.880]  Twelve weeks to the minute that the shooting began, I would like to ask everyone to join me in a moment of silence.
[02:14:17.310 --> 02:14:20.250]  We're good to go.
[02:14:35.060 --> 02:14:37.619]  We're good to go.
[02:15:05.029 --> 02:15:11.810]  We're good to go.
[02:16:03.770 --> 02:16:05.689]  Now that is what you call a voice.
[02:16:07.289 --> 02:16:09.909]  One of the greatest opera singers in the world.
[02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:18.289]  And Christopher Macchio, who is truly a great talent, is going to be back when I leave.
[02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:20.829]  And I'm going to stay backstage watching every song.
[02:16:20.949 --> 02:16:24.449]  He's going to sing three or four great songs, Nessa Dorma and others.
[02:16:25.090 --> 02:16:29.250]  And so I wouldn't leave your seat too fast when we're finished today.
[02:16:29.310 --> 02:16:33.479]  But this is in honor of Three great people, actually.
[02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:35.680]  Three great. And in particular, Corey.
[02:16:36.579 --> 02:16:38.780]  And we appreciate it.
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:40.819]  But that is a real voice, isn't it, huh?
[02:16:41.059 --> 02:16:42.860]  That's not — what do you think, Mr.
[02:16:43.379 --> 02:16:45.059]  Future Vice President? Pretty good, right?
[02:16:45.799 --> 02:16:48.500]  I don't know if you could do that, J.D., I don't know.
[02:16:48.780 --> 02:16:50.379]  I don't think J.D. can do that.
[02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:57.760]  In the face of murderous hate, Corey answered the most selfless kind of love.
[02:16:57.940 --> 02:17:08.559]  We are joined this evening by Corey's incredible widow, Helen, his two precious daughters, Kaylee and Allison, and his sisters, Kelly and Dawn.
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:10.319]  Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
[02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:11.680]  This is an incredible tribute.
[02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:16.100]  This is a tribute like no other, and he deserves it.
[02:17:17.139 --> 02:17:29.459]  To Helen and the entire family, I can only begin to imagine the depths of your grief, but I want you to know that just like you, we will carry his memory in our hearts for as long as we live.
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:39.610]  Everybody in this stadium and everybody that was there on that tragic evening, we are We are thinking about, Corey, we think about him a lot.
[02:17:39.850 --> 02:17:48.489]  I know he's looking down on us right now from heaven, smiling at his beloved wife and daughters and his mother, Karen, and his entire family.
[02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:49.909]  His entire family.
[02:17:51.250 --> 02:18:07.260]  And... And he's with you, and he's going to be with us for a long time because, you know, some people just don't die in vain, and what he's left behind is incredible.
[02:18:07.459 --> 02:18:09.219]  And so, God bless you, Corey.
[02:18:09.379 --> 02:18:10.780]  God bless you. Thank you very much.
[02:18:10.879 --> 02:18:16.280]  God bless you. You know, I just want a little story.
[02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:31.989]  Helen told me that on the day that they came to the rally, Corey was really excited because somebody gave him great seats right up front here with the With the people from North Carolina, the ladies from North Carolina, this is their 227th rally.
[02:18:32.110 --> 02:18:33.590]  I don't know what's going on with them.
[02:18:33.909 --> 02:18:35.190]  Those beautiful ladies.
[02:18:37.149 --> 02:18:39.389]  But they always seem to have good seats.
[02:18:40.229 --> 02:18:51.149]  But Cory had the best seat in the house and he was telling his wife and family on the way over in the car, he said, I'm telling you, he's going to invite me up in the stage because I do that sometimes.
[02:18:51.409 --> 02:18:53.750]  I take people, we invite them up at the stage.
[02:18:54.350 --> 02:18:57.350]  And she smiled thinking it'll never happen.
[02:18:57.489 --> 02:19:04.579]  And little did anyone realize That Corey would be on the stage three months later in an almost immortal position.
[02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:06.899]  And that's where he is today.
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:12.739]  He's on the stage in a, I think, not almost, I think it's a truly immortal position.
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:25.579]  So the love that he showed on that day and throughout his life is the love that sustains the entire movement, love that our families have, and it's love of our communities and love of our country.
[02:19:25.579 --> 02:19:38.370]  It's a force. More powerful than any hatred and malice because even in the darkest hours it shines forth as a guide and it guides us like nothing could ever guide us.
[02:19:38.489 --> 02:19:40.770]  It guides us really like a candle in the night.
[02:19:41.729 --> 02:19:54.729]  And so it's love like Corey's that is joining us to save our country, that's going to heal our country, and that is going to reunite our country as one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
[02:20:00.760 --> 02:20:07.059]  So what our opponents have never understood is that this movement has never been about me.
[02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:08.479]  It's always been about you.
[02:20:08.639 --> 02:20:15.079]  It's been about a lot of people, millions and millions of people, the biggest ever in the history of this country, maybe anywhere.
[02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:24.780]  And everyday people who are the heart and soul of our country, they love our movement, they love our country, and they know they're doing right.
[02:20:25.530 --> 02:20:31.510]  Your hopes are my hopes, your dreams are my dreams, and your future is what I am fighting for every single day.
[02:20:36.370 --> 02:20:39.370]  And now I have a great companion in J.D. Vance.
[02:20:39.489 --> 02:20:41.030]  How good was he the other night?
[02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:48.190]  How good? He was great.
[02:20:58.409 --> 02:20:59.790]  He was great.
[02:21:01.010 --> 02:21:09.930]  But from the very beginning of this journey, I've been on a mission to rescue our country from a failed and very corrupt political establishment.
[02:21:10.129 --> 02:21:11.829]  Very corrupt. We have to change it.
[02:21:11.930 --> 02:21:12.989]  We have to change it.
[02:21:13.069 --> 02:21:15.809]  We need also a very free and open press.
[02:21:16.549 --> 02:21:20.430]  And to give it back to the country you believe in and I believe in.
[02:21:20.510 --> 02:21:23.530]  It's the country that we were born in and the country that you deserve.
[02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:24.870]  You deserve this.
[02:21:25.090 --> 02:21:26.909]  In that mission, I will never quit.
[02:21:26.969 --> 02:21:28.750]  I will never bend. I will never break.
[02:21:28.950 --> 02:21:34.010]  I will never yield. Not even in the face of death itself.
[02:21:37.170 --> 02:21:47.280]  And I believe that every citizen deserves an America with a grand Very, very grand ambition, great opportunities and limitless.
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:49.579]  We just want limitless potential.
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:22:00.040]  We want an America where you can get ahead and be proud of life and provide for your family in a really decent way where we don't have crime.
[02:22:00.620 --> 02:22:03.799]  We have a fabulous military to protect us from evil.
[02:22:03.940 --> 02:22:06.159]  We have everything has to be the best.
[02:22:06.319 --> 02:22:07.659]  We have to have the best schools.
[02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:09.540]  We have to have strong borders.
[02:22:09.799 --> 02:22:12.079]  We don't want bad people coming in and hurting us.
[02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:16.760]  We don't want to have open borders, do we?
[02:22:18.659 --> 02:22:27.600]  You deserve a government that protects and respects its own citizens, that defends your sovereignty, your security and your dignity and your freedom.
[02:22:28.690 --> 02:22:40.010]  You deserve a nation that builds things, again, makes things better, that aims for the stars once more, and that once again commands respect.
[02:22:40.389 --> 02:22:43.170]  And we want to get respect like we had it four years ago.
[02:22:43.290 --> 02:22:45.090]  The entire world respected us.
[02:22:45.229 --> 02:22:46.270]  They respected us.
[02:22:46.850 --> 02:22:50.049]  They respected us more than they've ever respected us.
[02:22:50.149 --> 02:22:52.129]  And now they laugh at us.
[02:22:52.290 --> 02:22:54.610]  We can't have them laugh at us, can we?
[02:22:56.260 --> 02:23:09.139]  Above all, you deserve leadership in Washington that does not answer to the lobbyists, to the bureaucrats, or to the corrupt special interests, but answers only to you, the hardworking citizens of America, of which there are a lot of them.
[02:23:09.299 --> 02:23:10.559]  We have a lot of them.
[02:23:11.479 --> 02:23:13.239]  We have a lot of them.
[02:23:13.739 --> 02:23:23.899]  Over the past eight years, those who want to stop us from achieving this future have slandered me, impeached me, indicted me, tried to throw me off the ballot.
[02:23:24.659 --> 02:23:27.459]  And who knows, maybe even tried to kill me.
[02:23:28.420 --> 02:23:31.420]  But I've never stopped fighting for you, and I never will.
[02:23:31.979 --> 02:23:34.639]  Never will. Never gonna stop.
[02:23:40.979 --> 02:23:44.659]  Thank you.
[02:23:44.860 --> 02:23:53.459]  Thank you. And in turn, you have always stood with me.
[02:23:53.540 --> 02:23:54.760]  You have always stood with me.
[02:23:54.840 --> 02:23:57.180]  No matter what, you saw what was going on.
[02:23:57.299 --> 02:23:59.100]  You saw the hoaxes and the scams.
[02:23:59.219 --> 02:24:00.459]  You saw everything that went on.
[02:24:01.120 --> 02:24:02.840]  We are a team.
[02:24:03.020 --> 02:24:04.059]  We're a great team, I think.
[02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:07.920]  We're probably the best team ever in the history of our country, if you really think about it.
[02:24:08.600 --> 02:24:09.860]  We fought together.
[02:24:10.020 --> 02:24:11.780]  We have endured together.
[02:24:11.780 --> 02:24:13.920]  We have pushed onward together.
[02:24:14.260 --> 02:24:17.180]  And right here in Pennsylvania, we have bled together.
[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:21.799]  We've bled. We've had Three people that really got hit hard.
[02:24:22.399 --> 02:24:23.540]  Two of them made it.
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:25.719]  Great doctors. Great doctors.
[02:24:27.020 --> 02:24:28.639]  They weren't supposed to make it.
[02:24:28.780 --> 02:24:30.139]  I wasn't supposed to make it.
[02:24:30.260 --> 02:24:37.280]  People said... My great doctor at Butler said, Sir, you're the luckiest man of life.
[02:24:37.399 --> 02:24:40.379]  This would be a good time for you to go out and buy a lottery ticket.
[02:24:40.500 --> 02:24:42.000]  I've never seen anything like...
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.399]  I almost went out and bought a lottery ticket.
[02:24:44.459 --> 02:24:53.899]  I'll take it. And 31 days from now, here in this great Commonwealth and all across our land, we are going to win together.
[02:24:54.020 --> 02:24:55.239]  We are going to vote together.
[02:24:55.399 --> 02:24:59.040]  We're going to win the greatest election in the history of our country.
[02:24:59.219 --> 02:25:01.899]  Maybe the greatest election all time.
[02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:17.110]  After we all have been Through all of this together, we have...
[02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:19.069]  Nobody's gone through what we've gone through.
[02:25:19.229 --> 02:25:21.469]  Nobody. Because I go through it, you're going through it too.
[02:25:21.809 --> 02:25:23.889]  But there's never been anything like this.
[02:25:24.430 --> 02:25:26.170]  You know, I always say there's...
[02:25:26.889 --> 02:25:30.590]  An enemy from within, and there's an outside enemy.
[02:25:31.370 --> 02:25:35.110]  And if you're smart, the outside enemy is not going to be a problem.
[02:25:35.389 --> 02:25:39.770]  Russia, China, North Korea, we're not going to have a problem if you have a smart president.
[02:25:40.309 --> 02:25:44.709]  If you have not such a smart president, then it's a problem.
[02:25:44.989 --> 02:25:50.190]  But we have an enemy from within, which I think is much more dangerous than the outside enemy.
[02:25:50.829 --> 02:25:54.610]  We stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country.
[02:25:54.790 --> 02:25:56.629]  We can make these the four greatest years.
[02:25:56.770 --> 02:26:00.930]  We'll turn it around so fast that your head will spin.
[02:26:07.930 --> 02:26:16.329]  With victory on November 5th, we are going to redeem America's promise and unlock the extraordinary future that is just within our reach.
[02:26:16.430 --> 02:26:17.750]  It is now within our reach.
[02:26:18.149 --> 02:26:20.510]  Think of it one month from today.
[02:26:20.670 --> 02:26:23.290]  One month. We got to get there.
[02:26:23.670 --> 02:26:25.030]  We got to get there.
[02:26:25.129 --> 02:26:27.409]  They'll drop all sorts of bombs.
[02:26:27.549 --> 02:26:30.389]  They'll be hitting you, JD. They'll be hitting me.
[02:26:30.530 --> 02:26:32.170]  These people, they'll hit and hit.
[02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:36.049]  I think we've almost become immune to it, haven't we?
[02:26:36.829 --> 02:26:38.010]  We've become...
[02:26:38.010 --> 02:26:40.270]  We've become immune to it.
[02:26:40.270 --> 02:26:41.430]  You got a little dose of it?
[02:26:41.510 --> 02:26:42.610]  A couple of little doses?
[02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:44.809]  No, that's the only way...
[02:26:44.809 --> 02:26:48.329]  That's the only way they can even think about winning with open borders.
[02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:52.149]  Who wants open borders? Who wants men playing in women's sports?
[02:26:54.729 --> 02:26:59.329]  Who wants sex change operations for illegal aliens?
[02:27:02.450 --> 02:27:03.530]  In holding bins.
[02:27:03.690 --> 02:27:04.709]  No, I don't think so.
[02:27:05.170 --> 02:27:13.389]  We will begin a new era of soaring income, skyrocketing wealth, millions and millions of new jobs, and a booming middle class.
[02:27:13.569 --> 02:27:15.950]  We're going to boom like we've never boomed before.
[02:27:18.069 --> 02:27:26.790]  And we're going to unleash a manufacturing renaissance right here in Pennsylvania, including fracking like we've never fracked before.
[02:27:27.069 --> 02:27:28.729]  We're going to frack, frack, frack.
[02:27:33.319 --> 02:27:36.840]  You know, our opponent said, there'll be no fracking, no fracking.
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.479]  We'll never frack. We'll never frack.
[02:27:38.540 --> 02:27:42.020]  Then about, she started seeing poll numbers, by the way.
[02:27:42.739 --> 02:27:45.940]  And by the way, speaking of poll numbers, do you mind if I mention poll numbers?
[02:27:46.059 --> 02:27:48.139]  Because I only mention them when they're good.
[02:27:48.239 --> 02:27:54.500]  I never mention them. But one that's hit me really amazingly, Rasmussen, very highly respected poll.
[02:27:54.979 --> 02:27:56.120]  J.D., it just came out.
[02:27:56.159 --> 02:27:59.159]  I don't think you heard this one, but this is a shocker.
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:03.899]  You know, they always say the Democrats will win the Hispanic vote, but we've been creeping up rather rapidly.
[02:28:04.180 --> 02:28:10.200]  And Rasmussen is one of the most respected polls.
[02:28:10.420 --> 02:28:14.379]  I mean, Republicans would get 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 percent.
[02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:16.459]  They just came out with a poll.
[02:28:17.239 --> 02:28:18.940]  62 percent for Trump.
[02:28:20.040 --> 02:28:23.159]  Think of that. Think of that.
[02:28:26.459 --> 02:28:29.959]  And 34 percent for Kamala.
[02:28:33.219 --> 02:28:36.600]  I don't usually use her last name because nobody knows who I'm talking about.
[02:28:36.739 --> 02:28:37.959]  I go, Harris.
[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:40.360]  Harris. They say, who's Harris?
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:42.200]  It's happening all the time.
[02:28:42.299 --> 02:28:48.899]  Who's Harris? And we can't find out who she is because if we do, our country is going to be in big trouble.
[02:28:49.620 --> 02:28:57.620]  We will live in a very beautiful city or town that is safe and clean with borders that are sealed and secure.
[02:28:58.520 --> 02:29:00.840]  And again, we want people to come into our country.
[02:29:00.959 --> 02:29:02.399]  We all want that. We need that.
[02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:05.200]  But you know what? We want them to come in legally.
[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:07.659]  They're going to come in legally and love for our country.
[02:29:09.450 --> 02:29:13.930]  And America will once again be strong and confident and free, and we're going to have that.
[02:29:14.069 --> 02:29:16.170]  We're going to have it strong, confident, and free.
[02:29:16.649 --> 02:29:18.409]  That's why I'm here today.
[02:29:18.850 --> 02:29:22.149]  You know, I could right now be having a beautiful life.
[02:29:23.049 --> 02:29:24.690]  I don't have to be here.
[02:29:25.450 --> 02:29:28.889]  I could instead, I could be on a gorgeous beach someplace.
[02:29:29.549 --> 02:29:31.229]  I have such nice property.
[02:29:31.370 --> 02:29:37.469]  I could be in Monte Carlo as an example, but I'd rather be in Butler with you.
[02:29:40.799 --> 02:29:42.340]  I'd rather be in Butler.
[02:29:43.399 --> 02:29:52.500]  And I think J.D. would rather be in Butler, J.D. We love you!
[02:29:53.959 --> 02:29:55.399]  We love you!
[02:29:55.520 --> 02:29:56.799]  We love you!
[02:29:56.879 --> 02:29:58.159]  We love you!
[02:29:58.280 --> 02:29:59.479]  We love you!
[02:29:59.620 --> 02:30:00.840]  We love you!
[02:30:00.860 --> 02:30:02.200]  We love you!
[02:30:03.889 --> 02:30:06.989]  No, I'd rather be here because we're doing something.
[02:30:07.209 --> 02:30:10.190]  You know, they got a lot of rich guys that go, nobody cares about them.
[02:30:10.989 --> 02:30:16.430]  I had one about a month ago, very, very rich guy, and he called me up.
[02:30:16.510 --> 02:30:19.290]  He said, President, I've known him for a long time.
[02:30:19.409 --> 02:30:22.250]  I don't say how long because I don't want my wife to hear that number.
[02:30:22.290 --> 02:30:28.180]  It's a long time. But he's very successful, and he said to me, sir, could you do me a favor?
[02:30:28.319 --> 02:30:29.799]  The guy's worth billions of dollars.
[02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:32.260]  He said, could you do me a favor? I can't get into a restaurant.
[02:30:32.399 --> 02:30:34.219]  Do you think you could call them to get me in?
[02:30:34.959 --> 02:30:39.420]  And I said, what the hell is the good of being rich if you can't get into a restaurant, right?
[02:30:40.040 --> 02:30:41.260]  And I called the maitre d.
[02:30:41.440 --> 02:30:42.600]  Hi, I'm a little embarrassed.
[02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:44.719]  Hi, this is Donald Trump. I recognize your voice.
[02:30:45.139 --> 02:30:46.360]  I said, would you do me a favor?
[02:30:46.479 --> 02:30:49.219]  A friend of mine is online about a mile back.
[02:30:49.360 --> 02:30:50.879]  This is a very successful restaurant.
[02:30:51.540 --> 02:30:53.319]  And he's got his wife.
[02:30:53.440 --> 02:30:54.459]  I described the wife.
[02:30:54.659 --> 02:30:56.760]  Could you possibly go get them?
[02:30:56.979 --> 02:30:59.059]  Could you go get them and bring them in?
[02:30:59.059 --> 02:31:01.899]  And he did. And my friend called me up the next day.
[02:31:01.959 --> 02:31:03.299]  He said, thank you very much.
[02:31:03.399 --> 02:31:05.840]  Thank you. Oh.
[02:31:07.399 --> 02:31:09.159]  Doctor, please. Doctor in the house.
[02:31:09.219 --> 02:31:11.629]  Thank you. Thank you.
[02:31:11.969 --> 02:31:13.290]  Thank you very much, doctor.
[02:31:15.889 --> 02:31:20.370]  Thank you. Take your time, doctor, please.
[02:31:20.989 --> 02:31:22.229]  We got plenty of time, right?
[02:31:23.409 --> 02:31:24.629]  We got a lot of time.
[02:31:29.430 --> 02:31:30.510]  You doing okay?
[02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:49.180]  Take your time. We've got to protect our people, right?
[02:31:49.360 --> 02:32:08.399]  Take your time. It's all right,
[02:32:08.459 --> 02:32:10.299]  doctor. Go ahead. That's all right.
[02:32:12.579 --> 02:32:17.239]  That's all right. People come out two, three days ago, and then they get it.
[02:32:17.319 --> 02:32:20.219]  It's an amazing thing.
[02:32:20.360 --> 02:32:21.520]  It's an amazing thing.
[02:32:21.639 --> 02:32:23.479]  We appreciate it. Everybody appreciates it.
[02:32:23.979 --> 02:32:25.600]  Yep. Take your time.
[02:32:29.059 --> 02:32:30.520]  That's great. That's great.
[02:32:49.179 --> 02:32:51.959]  Do we have the greatest people in the world?
[02:32:52.139 --> 02:32:53.760]  We have the greatest people in the world.
[02:32:58.100 --> 02:33:00.319]  First responders, thank you very much.
[02:33:08.909 --> 02:33:12.809]  Looks like somebody may have collapsed in the crowd, waiting on the doctor to take care of him.
[02:33:13.569 --> 02:33:15.729]  I assume everybody's okay based on what I'm seeing here.
[02:33:17.430 --> 02:33:26.770]  Crowd is chanting and shouting at Trump, words of support, and he's waiting patiently to make sure everything's okay before he speaks again.
[02:33:50.299 --> 02:33:52.299]  Now the crowd is singing the national anthem.
[02:33:53.180 --> 02:33:58.719]  We're told that 100,000 people are there.
[02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:20.860]  We're good to go.
[02:34:20.879 --> 02:34:35.260]  We're good to go.
[02:34:57.719 --> 02:35:23.129]  USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! Looks like Trump is eyeing the situation before speaking again.
[02:35:23.229 --> 02:35:26.790]  Of course, he doesn't want to be rude and speak over what appears to have been an emergency.
[02:35:26.969 --> 02:35:28.690]  I don't know if somebody collapsed because they're overheated.
[02:35:28.809 --> 02:35:36.690]  Many people, as Nick Sordor mentioned at the beginning of the broadcast today, waited all night to have a good seat at this rally.
[02:35:37.129 --> 02:35:42.569]  And so imagine the heat exhaustion, dehydration, things like that that could be happening on the ground there.
[02:35:42.670 --> 02:35:46.290]  But assume everybody's okay because I don't see any panic in there in the crowd.
[02:35:46.889 --> 02:35:57.579]  Why don't we go to This special report from Darren McBreen for the next couple of minutes and come back as soon as Trump begins speaking again.
[02:36:01.819 --> 02:36:06.020]  And we'll keep the rally picture in picture during this report to make sure you don't miss anything.
[02:36:12.780 --> 02:36:15.639]  And it's only going to get worse until people wake up.
[02:36:15.739 --> 02:36:17.100]  And you will wake up one way or another.
[02:36:20.049 --> 02:36:32.549]  You may wake up when the drones are flying down the street and the big trash trucks robot-driven are pulling up and getting the dead bodies and your wife and kids are dead and for some reason you're immune to the new virus and you're sitting there with the electricity off and no food and half the city's dead.
[02:36:33.610 --> 02:36:38.510]  And just know that often luxurious places that people like Zuckerberg will be in their bunkers while we're all dying.
[02:36:43.049 --> 02:36:45.250]  But our people are everywhere.
[02:36:46.409 --> 02:36:47.729]  And they're watching the enemy.
[02:36:48.069 --> 02:37:06.889]  And when they all jump on their private jets, this week, next month, a year from now, whatever it is, and the private airports are full of all the establishment and their minions loaded up with all their crap, flying off to their armored fortresses, that's another key to know when they're about to pull the trigger on their bioweapon.
[02:37:08.530 --> 02:37:09.969]  Or a nuclear war.
[02:37:11.639 --> 02:37:17.260]  But after the dust settles, we know where to get the medicine and food we need as survivors, don't we?
[02:37:17.700 --> 02:37:22.899]  And that's what matters at the end, is we will get these people.
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:27.120]  I may not be around for it, and a lot of you won't be around for it.
[02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:33.459]  But don't get on the bus when they tell you they're relocating you for your safety when all the food and energy's off.
[02:37:34.940 --> 02:37:37.520]  If you go to that forced labor camp, you ain't ever coming back.
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:42.620]  We took a bullet for America, and all we are all asking is that everyone goes out and votes.
[02:37:42.739 --> 02:37:45.000]  We gotta win. We can't let this happen to our country.
[02:37:45.100 --> 02:37:47.920]  We can't take another four years like this.
[02:37:47.940 --> 02:37:49.079]  We won't have a country left.
[02:37:49.219 --> 02:37:50.440]  We're not gonna have a country left.
[02:37:51.059 --> 02:38:08.969]  And all of this will be for nothing if you don't We're going to change our country around and fast.
[02:38:09.170 --> 02:38:10.190]  We're going to do things that...
[02:38:10.700 --> 02:38:12.180]  Nobody thought it were possible.
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:13.379]  We're going to do them fast.
[02:38:13.879 --> 02:38:19.500]  So Pennsylvania, it's time to stand up for America and time to save our country.
[02:38:19.659 --> 02:38:21.319]  This is really about saving our country.
[02:38:21.440 --> 02:38:22.559]  It's never been like this.
[02:38:22.979 --> 02:38:24.700]  When you look at the crime, look at the crime.
[02:38:25.219 --> 02:38:27.659]  Look at the people that are coming in, murderers.
[02:38:27.979 --> 02:38:33.899]  13,099 murderers led in over the last short period of time.
[02:38:35.180 --> 02:38:36.500]  Murderers that have been...
[02:38:37.790 --> 02:38:42.569]  Release from penitentiaries, prisons, jails, released into our country.
[02:38:43.370 --> 02:38:45.489]  Crime rates all over the world are down.
[02:38:45.649 --> 02:38:48.829]  They're taking their gang members and their criminals.
[02:38:48.989 --> 02:38:53.450]  They're taking their people in jail and they're releasing them into our country.
[02:38:53.549 --> 02:38:56.309]  We can't have it. You know, we just can't have it.
[02:38:56.569 --> 02:38:58.670]  How do you get more simple than that?
[02:38:58.770 --> 02:39:00.469]  They're releasing murderers.
[02:39:00.549 --> 02:39:02.010]  They're releasing drug dealers.
[02:39:02.149 --> 02:39:04.729]  They're releasing gang members and criminals.
[02:39:06.370 --> 02:39:09.309]  Human traffickers. Mostly they traffic in women.
[02:39:10.049 --> 02:39:12.309]  And they're releasing them all into our country.
[02:39:12.549 --> 02:39:13.790]  And they're emptying their jails.
[02:39:13.989 --> 02:39:20.309]  And their crime rates in Venezuela are way down because, you know, but it's not only in South America.
[02:39:20.389 --> 02:39:22.930]  It's all over the world, in Africa, the Congo.
[02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:26.489]  A lot of people coming out of the Congo in Africa.
[02:39:26.709 --> 02:39:28.350]  They're coming out from Asia.
[02:39:28.909 --> 02:39:30.750]  They're coming out from the Middle East, Yemen.
[02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:32.709]  They're coming out from Yemen.
[02:39:32.850 --> 02:39:40.909]  A lot of people coming out of Yemen And they're known terrorists, and they just release them into our country from countries unknown also.
[02:39:41.069 --> 02:39:42.389]  They know nothing about the people.
[02:39:42.569 --> 02:39:45.690]  Go right in. These people are crazy.
[02:39:47.729 --> 02:39:48.870]  And we have to win.
[02:39:48.950 --> 02:39:55.389]  We'll stop it immediately, and we'll have to — we will — look, it will be a big deportation.
[02:39:55.510 --> 02:39:56.909]  We're going to deport these people.
[02:39:56.969 --> 02:39:58.870]  We're going to get them out of our country immediately.
[02:39:59.809 --> 02:40:01.329]  Or we won't have a country.
[02:40:02.969 --> 02:40:05.989]  And if we win Pennsylvania, we will win the whole thing.
[02:40:06.149 --> 02:40:07.590]  The whole thing will be won.
[02:40:09.969 --> 02:40:15.870]  So for the sake of our families, for the sake of our children, we will keep on going.
[02:40:16.069 --> 02:40:23.069]  And as an expression goes, I mean, I'm a little embarrassed to say it, to be honest with you, but I'm going to say it because a lot of people do say it.
[02:40:23.129 --> 02:40:25.430]  We will fight, fight, fight.
[02:40:27.170 --> 02:40:28.690]  We're going to fight for our country.
[02:40:30.590 --> 02:40:32.049]  We're going to fight for our country.
[02:40:33.889 --> 02:40:46.530]  And together we will save this country, we will restore the republic, and America's future will be bigger, better, bolder, brighter, happier, stronger, freer and greater, and more united than ever before.
[02:40:46.709 --> 02:40:47.850]  Our country will be united.
[02:40:48.049 --> 02:40:49.370]  You'll watch. You'll watch.
[02:40:49.709 --> 02:40:53.709]  You know, we're the most successful country ever, maybe in the world, during my term.
[02:40:53.889 --> 02:40:56.629]  We're the greatest economy that we've ever had.
[02:40:56.870 --> 02:40:58.090]  And you know what was happening?
[02:40:58.190 --> 02:41:02.549]  We were uniting. The other side, radical left people were coming over.
[02:41:02.670 --> 02:41:05.030]  They wanted to meet. They were coming over.
[02:41:05.329 --> 02:41:07.069]  Women. Men.
[02:41:08.770 --> 02:41:18.209]  If you look at population, our black population, our Hispanic population, our Asian population, everybody was doing better.
[02:41:18.709 --> 02:41:26.329]  People that went to the best schools and best colleges in the world got the highest marks and people that couldn't get a high school degree.
[02:41:26.809 --> 02:41:33.600]  Everybody was doing better and our country was coming together and then We got hit with COVID, a gift from China.
[02:41:33.860 --> 02:41:35.540]  Some people would call it the China virus.
[02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:37.760]  And we did a great job on that, too.
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:38.899]  We did a great job.
[02:41:39.219 --> 02:41:41.000]  But the world was disturbed.
[02:41:41.930 --> 02:41:44.750]  $60 trillion in damage worldwide.
[02:41:45.389 --> 02:41:48.610]  Millions and millions of — tens of millions of people killed.
[02:41:49.170 --> 02:41:55.750]  And we still, during this four-year period, we had the greatest economy, one of the great countries of the world.
[02:41:55.930 --> 02:42:01.409]  And we left with a stock market that was higher than it was just prior to COVID coming in.
[02:42:01.790 --> 02:42:04.170]  So what we did was something really incredible.
[02:42:04.170 --> 02:42:07.809]  But we had the greatest, most successful country ever.
[02:42:07.969 --> 02:42:10.049]  We had the greatest economy in our history.
[02:42:10.409 --> 02:42:12.969]  And we're going to do it again and maybe even better.
[02:42:13.110 --> 02:42:19.209]  We learned a lot. We learned a lot about people and about doing things and what works and what doesn't work.
[02:42:19.270 --> 02:42:20.950]  And we're going to do it and it's going to be quick.
[02:42:21.270 --> 02:42:26.129]  It's going to be quick. And we're going to have safe cities and we're going to have great cities again.
[02:42:26.270 --> 02:42:31.209]  And we're going to have a capital in Washington, D.C., which is right now crime ridden.
[02:42:31.819 --> 02:42:43.479]  You leave from the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, you go drive down to Washington, D.C., and you drive down and you end up getting murdered, you end up getting hurt, you get mugged.
[02:42:43.719 --> 02:42:49.639]  We are going to straighten out Washington, D.C. We're going to make it again the most beautiful capital in the world.
[02:42:49.719 --> 02:42:50.799]  We're not going to have graffiti.
[02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:54.000]  We're not going to have graffiti on our marble columns.
[02:42:54.139 --> 02:42:59.780]  We're not going to have roads that have potholes all over them and medians that are falling into the highways.
[02:43:01.020 --> 02:43:02.299]  We're going to run it properly.
[02:43:02.899 --> 02:43:04.079]  We're going to change it.
[02:43:04.139 --> 02:43:06.420]  We're going to run it properly. It's an embarrassment to us.
[02:43:06.500 --> 02:43:11.780]  Can you imagine foreign leaders coming in and running over roads that haven't been paved in years?
[02:43:12.500 --> 02:43:19.479]  We're honored to be joined tonight by one of the people who is going to help us build this incredible future.
[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:22.219]  And he is a truly incredible guy.
[02:43:22.299 --> 02:43:23.860]  And I don't say that that often.
[02:43:28.469 --> 02:43:29.850]  He's a great gentleman.
[02:43:30.110 --> 02:43:38.930]  He's done such an unbelievable job for North Carolina, for Georgia, for Alabama, for Florida, for Tennessee.
[02:43:39.690 --> 02:43:41.969]  His name is Elon Musk.
[02:43:42.290 --> 02:43:44.069]  He saved free speech.
[02:43:44.090 --> 02:43:48.870]  He created So many different great things.
[02:43:49.110 --> 02:43:50.389]  Where is he?
[02:43:50.549 --> 02:43:51.829]  Come on up here, Elon.
[02:43:52.149 --> 02:44:03.569]  He created the first major American car company in generations, and his rocket company is the only reason we can now send American astronauts into space.
[02:44:04.329 --> 02:44:06.889]  Come here. Take over, Elon.
[02:44:07.090 --> 02:44:09.469]  Yes, take over. Hi, everyone.
[02:44:22.510 --> 02:44:29.629]  As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm dark MAGA. Well, first of all, I want to say what an honor it is to be here.
[02:44:30.129 --> 02:44:37.549]  And, you know, the true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire.
[02:44:40.670 --> 02:44:49.250]  And we had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs, and another who was fist pumping after getting shot.
[02:44:52.010 --> 02:44:53.190]  Fight! Fight! Fight!
[02:44:53.909 --> 02:44:55.969]  Blood coming down the face.
[02:44:57.129 --> 02:45:02.850]  Now, America is the home of the brave.
[02:45:06.270 --> 02:45:09.690]  And there's no truer test than courage under fire.
[02:45:11.110 --> 02:45:13.250]  So, who do you want representing America?
[02:45:15.129 --> 02:45:17.430]  Yeah. Absolutely.
[02:45:19.409 --> 02:45:25.729]  And I think this election is the most important election of our lifetime.
[02:45:27.129 --> 02:45:29.110]  This is no ordinary election.
[02:45:30.489 --> 02:45:33.389]  The other side wants to take away your freedom of speech.
[02:45:34.069 --> 02:45:36.229]  They want to take away your right to bear arms.
[02:45:37.889 --> 02:45:43.209]  They want to take away your right to vote effectively.
[02:45:43.930 --> 02:45:56.709]  You've got 14 states now that don't require voter ID. California, where I used to live, just passed a law banning voter ID for voting.
[02:46:01.190 --> 02:46:03.409]  I still can't believe that's real.
[02:46:05.090 --> 02:46:10.750]  So, how are you supposed to have a proper election if there's no ID? It's meaningless.
[02:46:11.829 --> 02:46:16.829]  And free speech, free speech is the bedrock of democracy.
[02:46:20.430 --> 02:46:27.530]  And if people don't know what's going on, if they don't know the truth, how can you make an informed vote?
[02:46:27.690 --> 02:46:30.850]  You must have free speech in order to have democracy.
[02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:32.850]  That's why it's the First Amendment.
[02:46:34.090 --> 02:46:39.250]  And the Second Amendment is there to ensure that we have the First Amendment.
[02:46:49.469 --> 02:46:53.149]  President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution.
[02:46:53.649 --> 02:46:56.649]  He must win to preserve democracy in America.
[02:47:00.930 --> 02:47:04.190]  We want Trump!
[02:47:15.389 --> 02:47:18.149]  This is a must-win situation.
[02:47:18.450 --> 02:47:26.709]  Must win. So I have one ask for everyone in the audience, everyone who watches this video, everyone on the livestream.
[02:47:27.229 --> 02:47:29.469]  This one request is very important.
[02:47:29.790 --> 02:47:31.610]  Register to vote.
[02:47:32.729 --> 02:47:43.340]  Okay? And get everyone you know and everyone you don't know Drag them to register to vote.
[02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:48.440]  There's only two days left to register to vote in Georgia and Arizona.
[02:47:48.659 --> 02:47:53.520]  48 hours. Text people now.
[02:47:54.500 --> 02:47:59.440]  Now! And then make sure they actually do vote.
[02:48:02.579 --> 02:48:06.459]  If they don't, this will be the last election.
[02:48:06.760 --> 02:48:07.979]  That's my prediction.
[02:48:09.100 --> 02:48:10.120]  Nothing's more important.
[02:48:10.620 --> 02:48:15.799]  Nothing's more important. So get everyone you know.
[02:48:16.139 --> 02:48:19.459]  So speaking to people out there, everyone in the crowd, I think, is already convinced.
[02:48:20.239 --> 02:48:34.489]  But for people out there that are watching the video, watching the livestream, You need to get everyone you know, at work, your friends, family, text groups, your social media, everything, get them to register to vote right now.
[02:48:34.709 --> 02:48:37.250]  Only two days left for Georgia and Arizona.
[02:48:37.590 --> 02:48:39.569]  Only a couple weeks left in Pennsylvania.
[02:48:40.530 --> 02:48:43.409]  And if they're not registered to vote, it doesn't matter at that point.
[02:48:44.270 --> 02:48:47.450]  Register to vote. I'm being repetitive for a reason, okay?
[02:48:48.250 --> 02:48:50.850]  So, nothing is more important.
[02:48:53.030 --> 02:48:55.889]  And a lot of people think maybe their vote doesn't count.
[02:48:56.270 --> 02:48:57.389]  Well, it does.
[02:48:57.989 --> 02:48:59.889]  Okay? It does.
[02:49:00.250 --> 02:49:05.030]  It matters. And this election could be decided by 1,000 votes, 500 votes.
[02:49:06.270 --> 02:49:07.549]  A tiny margin.
[02:49:08.770 --> 02:49:12.309]  So get everyone you know to register to vote.
[02:49:12.790 --> 02:49:14.510]  I believe that's swapthevote.com.
[02:49:14.649 --> 02:49:15.889]  I believe that's the site.
[02:49:16.049 --> 02:49:18.770]  And double-check that your registration is good.
[02:49:18.829 --> 02:49:25.690]  Don't take it for granted. I'm just being repetitive about this point because it is the one takeaway.
[02:49:26.370 --> 02:49:33.370]  More than anything that will matter is getting those registrations and then getting everyone you know to actually vote.
[02:49:33.709 --> 02:49:37.170]  That is what will decide this election, especially in Pennsylvania.
[02:49:46.290 --> 02:49:47.590]  So thank you.
[02:49:47.889 --> 02:49:50.309]  And honestly, you want to just be a pest.
[02:49:50.590 --> 02:49:56.549]  Just be a pest to everyone you know, people on the street everywhere.
[02:49:57.190 --> 02:49:58.229]  Vote, vote, vote.
[02:49:58.850 --> 02:49:59.909]  Fight, fight, fight.
[02:50:00.209 --> 02:50:02.149]  Vote, vote, vote. Thank you.
[02:50:03.969 --> 02:50:07.309]  Thank you.
[02:50:21.350 --> 02:50:25.950]  What a great guy. And he'd rather be making rocket ships because he'd really rather do that.
[02:50:26.489 --> 02:50:30.129]  Nobody better. I think he's got 90% of the rockets that go up.
[02:50:30.270 --> 02:50:32.469]  But, Elon, thank you very much.
[02:50:32.610 --> 02:50:35.149]  Incredible. Incredible. What he says is true.
[02:50:35.950 --> 02:50:37.350]  What he says is true.
[02:50:37.590 --> 02:50:39.969]  You know, we're all having fun here tonight.
[02:50:40.129 --> 02:50:46.569]  But if we don't register and if we don't vote, we're just going to look upon this as another sort of nice day in our life.
[02:50:47.209 --> 02:50:48.590]  But it won't even be a nice day.
[02:50:48.690 --> 02:50:53.209]  We're going to look back and we're going to say, wow, it's a lot of time, a lot of effort.
[02:50:53.309 --> 02:50:57.930]  We've got to win. If we don't win, it's, as he said, it's just not important.
[02:50:58.129 --> 02:50:59.149]  We have to save our country.
[02:50:59.170 --> 02:51:00.329]  So you have to get out and vote.
[02:51:00.809 --> 02:51:01.909]  You've got to get out and vote.
[02:51:01.969 --> 02:51:06.270]  You've got to get your friends and vote because, you know, they play a lot of tricks, this particular other side.
[02:51:06.989 --> 02:51:10.030]  Elon's a very nice guy. He doesn't want to say it, but they play a lot of tricks.
[02:51:10.149 --> 02:51:12.250]  We can't let it happen. We can't let it happen again.
[02:51:12.250 --> 02:51:13.370]  We can't let it happen.
[02:51:14.290 --> 02:51:16.270]  And one thing, they showed us how bad they are.
[02:51:16.370 --> 02:51:18.049]  They showed us how bad a job they do.
[02:51:18.270 --> 02:51:20.690]  So that's one thing we got from this four years.
[02:51:20.850 --> 02:51:22.149]  They've done the worst job.
[02:51:22.270 --> 02:51:24.549]  It's the worst president in the history of our country.
[02:51:24.709 --> 02:51:28.049]  It's the worst vice president in the history of our country.
[02:51:28.190 --> 02:51:35.110]  And if you watched over the last couple of days, they are doing — this is a Katrina For them.
[02:51:35.290 --> 02:51:36.790]  This is one of the worst.
[02:51:37.170 --> 02:51:43.149]  They say it's the worst job ever done on helping people through the ravages of a hurricane.
[02:51:43.610 --> 02:51:49.170]  And they're watching. She's out there campaigning in San Francisco, a place that she ruined.
[02:51:49.389 --> 02:51:52.049]  Okay, she ruined. She ruined San Francisco.
[02:51:53.879 --> 02:51:56.159]  Think of this. She ruined San Francisco.
[02:51:56.440 --> 02:52:00.219]  She was the worst DA. And she ruined the state of California.
[02:52:00.500 --> 02:52:02.879]  And now she wants to ruin the United States of America.
[02:52:03.020 --> 02:52:09.739]  We can't let her do it. So I called Elon to tell him that they needed Starlink as an example.
[02:52:10.120 --> 02:52:11.440]  They couldn't get Starlink.
[02:52:12.409 --> 02:52:15.170]  I didn't know what Starlink was, I must tell you.
[02:52:16.149 --> 02:52:17.250]  Elon, I'm so embarrassed.
[02:52:17.450 --> 02:52:19.389]  I didn't know what the hell Starlink was.
[02:52:20.030 --> 02:52:21.290]  He loves Starlink.
[02:52:21.590 --> 02:52:24.510]  He can tell you every little screw that's needed, every wire.
[02:52:24.690 --> 02:52:32.270]  Me, I didn't know. But when I was in North Carolina and Georgia just the other day, Yesterday, to be exact.
[02:52:32.950 --> 02:52:37.409]  But they were saying we have tremendous communications, especially in North Carolina.
[02:52:37.950 --> 02:52:39.750]  And we have tremendous problems.
[02:52:39.930 --> 02:52:40.969]  We have no communication.
[02:52:41.209 --> 02:52:43.430]  The poles were ripped down. The wires were underwater.
[02:52:44.069 --> 02:52:45.450]  Houses were destroyed.
[02:52:46.609 --> 02:52:51.030]  Possibly a thousand people, maybe more, will be, you know, there's 600 people missing.
[02:52:51.209 --> 02:52:54.329]  Missing is not good, because you know what missing means generally.
[02:52:54.329 --> 02:52:57.010]  That's really bad. And they had no communication.
[02:52:57.010 --> 02:53:02.409]  They had literally no communication with, they called it the mainland, because the water was so crazy.
[02:53:02.409 --> 02:53:04.170]  It was like they were in the middle of a lake.
[02:53:04.870 --> 02:53:06.549]  And they'd never seen anything like it.
[02:53:06.709 --> 02:53:09.850]  And they said, do you know somebody named Elon Musk?
[02:53:09.950 --> 02:53:11.629]  I said, yeah, I happen to know him a little bit.
[02:53:11.729 --> 02:53:12.969]  He just endorsed me, actually.
[02:53:13.690 --> 02:53:15.270]  Although he endorsed me a long time ago.
[02:53:15.430 --> 02:53:20.309]  But he still, to me, every day is a good endorsement from Elon.
[02:53:20.729 --> 02:53:21.909]  Nobody's smarter than Elon.
[02:53:22.709 --> 02:53:24.909]  And... They said, could you do us a favor?
[02:53:25.010 --> 02:53:27.549]  Could you help us? We're trying to get Starlink.
[02:53:27.909 --> 02:53:30.690]  And it's very hard to get. Most people say you can't even get it.
[02:53:30.770 --> 02:53:33.489]  I called up Elon. I said, North Carolina is in big trouble.
[02:53:33.590 --> 02:53:34.610]  Georgia is in big trouble.
[02:53:35.069 --> 02:53:36.149]  They need communication.
[02:53:36.170 --> 02:53:42.649]  They have none because their poles have been knocked down and their wires are underwater and even dangerous, dangerously underwater.
[02:53:43.049 --> 02:53:44.270]  But they have no communication.
[02:53:44.790 --> 02:53:47.450]  Elon, could you do something about Starlink?
[02:53:47.590 --> 02:53:48.889]  Whatever the hell that is, Elon.
[02:53:49.690 --> 02:53:52.389]  Whatever Starlink. That's all they want to hear is Starlink.
[02:53:53.020 --> 02:53:54.760]  And an amazing thing happened.
[02:53:54.979 --> 02:53:58.120]  I got a call from one of the top people in North Carolina.
[02:53:58.379 --> 02:54:01.100]  I got a call from another great person in Georgia.
[02:54:01.739 --> 02:54:04.239]  And I wasn't finished with my phone call yet.
[02:54:04.440 --> 02:54:07.739]  And they got word that Starlink would be delivered to the states.
[02:54:08.079 --> 02:54:11.530]  I said... No, and I said, what the hell is he?
[02:54:11.750 --> 02:54:13.389]  What kind of a system is that?
[02:54:13.829 --> 02:54:17.129]  Normally, you'd have to hang up, and he'd go and call people.
[02:54:17.569 --> 02:54:19.149]  He did it during the phone call.
[02:54:19.229 --> 02:54:20.790]  What kind of a system do you have?
[02:54:21.190 --> 02:54:25.510]  That's why he's a very advanced person.
[02:54:28.129 --> 02:54:30.069]  I want to thank you, Ilan, because I got it.
[02:54:30.190 --> 02:54:31.430]  And I said, how does it work?
[02:54:31.510 --> 02:54:32.770]  Two days later, how does it work?
[02:54:32.909 --> 02:54:35.450]  They said, much better than the wires.
[02:54:35.690 --> 02:54:37.709]  So now I'm saying, why the hell are they...
[02:54:38.360 --> 02:54:39.940]  You're going to come out very well anyway.
[02:54:40.100 --> 02:54:42.280]  And you know, he also said, you don't have to pay me.
[02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:44.079]  You pay me someday when you get the money back.
[02:54:44.180 --> 02:54:46.260]  You don't have to pay me. He wanted nothing.
[02:54:46.379 --> 02:54:48.579]  He's a great guy. Thank you, Elon, for being here.
[02:54:48.780 --> 02:54:50.100]  Thank you very much.
[02:54:51.100 --> 02:54:53.379]  Great honor. Great honor.
[02:55:12.090 --> 02:55:15.010]  Thank you, Eli. And that's heartfelt.
[02:55:15.170 --> 02:55:16.229]  I can't even see the end.
[02:55:16.350 --> 02:55:18.290]  That's a lot of people here today.
[02:55:19.950 --> 02:55:25.190]  We're also joined by a great gentleman, a top, top, brilliant student.
[02:55:25.889 --> 02:55:30.950]  He went to a tremendous college, and he graduated right at the top of his class.
[02:55:31.049 --> 02:55:32.629]  In two years, I didn't know you could do that.
[02:55:32.629 --> 02:55:38.829]  It's a four-year college. Then he went to the military, then he came out, and he did fantastically inside the military.
[02:55:38.950 --> 02:55:40.930]  Then he came out, he went to Yale.
[02:55:41.709 --> 02:55:43.489]  Without the benefit of family ties.
[02:55:43.629 --> 02:55:47.229]  You know what that means, right? That's pretty good without family ties.
[02:55:47.329 --> 02:55:48.629]  I don't know too many of those people.
[02:55:48.709 --> 02:55:50.209]  They had no family ties. He got in.
[02:55:50.549 --> 02:55:54.069]  He can't get in. And he graduated along with his wife.
[02:55:54.850 --> 02:55:58.729]  They're not going to have any problems with your kids academically, I can tell you.
[02:55:58.790 --> 02:56:01.370]  His wife and him were like the top students in the class.
[02:56:01.790 --> 02:56:05.370]  But he went to Yale Law School and then he went out into the private sector and did great.
[02:56:05.450 --> 02:56:09.280]  Then he ran for The Senate, and he did fantastically.
[02:56:09.299 --> 02:56:11.860]  He won. And he's like a rocket ship.
[02:56:11.979 --> 02:56:14.979]  He's like one of Elon's rocket ships, the way his career is going.
[02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:16.780]  But you see why?
[02:56:16.940 --> 02:56:18.879]  Because he's a really brilliant guy.
[02:56:19.079 --> 02:56:22.319]  And you saw that the other night in the debate, right?
[02:56:22.459 --> 02:56:24.120]  You saw that the other night in the debate.
[02:56:26.799 --> 02:56:28.540]  You know the expression they have?
[02:56:28.979 --> 02:56:31.379]  If that were a fight, they would have stopped it, right?
[02:56:32.979 --> 02:56:37.659]  So I just want to thank JD. I was always confident in that pick.
[02:56:38.159 --> 02:56:41.559]  And we had great people too, JD. We have every one of those guys were great.
[02:56:41.700 --> 02:56:43.200]  Every one of them would have done a great job.
[02:56:43.319 --> 02:56:46.459]  It was amazing. But we appreciate the job you're doing.
[02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:48.000]  And he's also very energetic.
[02:56:48.139 --> 02:56:52.219]  And he'll go on anywhere. He'll go on MSDNC. I say, oh, he's on that.
[02:56:52.819 --> 02:56:55.840]  He'll go on CNN. It's like, he has no problem.
[02:56:55.920 --> 02:56:56.959]  He swats him like this.
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:56:58.700]  He has no problem.
[02:57:01.069 --> 02:57:06.209]  No, it's true. You know, other people say, sir, I'd rather not do that one.
[02:57:06.590 --> 02:57:08.409]  I'd rather not do that one, sir.
[02:57:08.569 --> 02:57:09.610]  I'd rather not do them.
[02:57:09.790 --> 02:57:11.409]  Because they are, you know, very available.
[02:57:11.530 --> 02:57:12.610]  With him, he doesn't care.
[02:57:12.690 --> 02:57:14.649]  He says, they're not going to outsmart me.
[02:57:15.370 --> 02:57:17.450]  So I want to thank J.D., you've done a great job.
[02:57:17.530 --> 02:57:22.750]  Thank you very much. Amazing.
[02:57:23.690 --> 02:57:35.950]  J.D., [...] We have a lot of senators and a lot of people from Congress.
[02:57:36.090 --> 02:57:38.409]  I'm going to introduce a few of them that are really outstanding.
[02:57:38.610 --> 02:57:42.850]  And they are warriors and they're great patriots.
[02:57:43.370 --> 02:57:44.450]  Senator Eric Schmidt.
[02:57:44.790 --> 02:57:45.930]  Where is Eric Schmidt?
[02:57:46.069 --> 02:57:47.250]  He's around here someplace.
[02:57:48.049 --> 02:57:49.909]  Nice, tall, handsome guy.
[02:57:50.750 --> 02:57:52.870]  Thank you, Eric. What a great job you've done.
[02:57:53.090 --> 02:57:54.889]  He helps us so much with the Senate.
[02:57:55.170 --> 02:57:56.549]  And we've got a great Senate.
[02:57:56.709 --> 02:57:58.350]  We have to get...
[02:57:58.940 --> 02:58:00.399]  A couple of more senators elected.
[02:58:00.559 --> 02:58:01.959]  I think it's going to happen, too.
[02:58:02.139 --> 02:58:04.959]  I think it's going to happen. We have members of Congress here.
[02:58:05.059 --> 02:58:06.139]  Dan Muser.
[02:58:07.219 --> 02:58:08.440]  Dan? Where's Dan?
[02:58:08.559 --> 02:58:10.100]  Great. Great job.
[02:58:10.719 --> 02:58:12.340]  Real warrior. These are warriors.
[02:58:12.920 --> 02:58:14.680]  Guy Reschenthaler.
[02:58:15.500 --> 02:58:19.659]  That's the hardest name in the Senate to pronounce, but I've learned how to pronounce it.
[02:58:20.040 --> 02:58:21.260]  Guy, thank you very much.
[02:58:21.399 --> 02:58:23.340]  Great. Where's Guy? Guy, thank you very much, Guy.
[02:58:24.139 --> 02:58:25.739]  Glenn G.T. Thompson.
[02:58:27.120 --> 02:58:28.620]  Fantastic guy. Thanks, Glenn.
[02:58:28.899 --> 02:58:31.040]  Great job. John Joyce.
[02:58:32.680 --> 02:58:33.719]  Thank you, John.
[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:36.040]  Corey Mills.
[02:58:36.200 --> 02:58:37.399]  He's out there fighting, too.
[02:58:37.500 --> 02:58:42.719]  He's out there. He is out there in North Carolina, Georgia.
[02:58:42.979 --> 02:58:44.440]  He's out there helping people.
[02:58:46.219 --> 02:58:51.059]  Mike Waltz, who's a tremendous national security asset.
[02:58:52.219 --> 02:58:54.719]  Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Mike.
[02:58:56.010 --> 02:59:01.350]  Okay, and a man who was my doctor, I got to know him as a doctor in the White House, right?
[02:59:02.270 --> 02:59:06.729]  And then, before that, he was actually an admiral, and then he went to the White House.
[02:59:06.829 --> 02:59:08.350]  He was a great admiral.
[02:59:08.430 --> 02:59:11.629]  He was a great doctor. And I love him for one reason.
[02:59:11.770 --> 02:59:16.629]  They asked him in the White House, the press, the fake news media said, who is the most?
[02:59:16.670 --> 02:59:20.309]  He was the doctor for Obama, Bush, and Trump.
[02:59:20.649 --> 02:59:23.190]  That's pretty good, right? White House doctor for the three of us.
[02:59:23.190 --> 02:59:24.899]  He said, The press.
[02:59:25.200 --> 02:59:26.819]  Who is the healthiest of the three?
[02:59:27.059 --> 02:59:29.520]  He said, definitely it's Donald Trump.
[02:59:29.739 --> 02:59:32.860]  There's not even a contest. And I love that guy.
[02:59:33.479 --> 02:59:37.719]  When he said that, J.D., when he said that, I said, I like this guy.
[02:59:38.770 --> 02:59:41.889]  So then he said, you know, sir, he was leaving the White House.
[02:59:42.049 --> 02:59:43.729]  He said, you know, I'd love to run for Congress.
[02:59:44.290 --> 02:59:47.030]  And he ran with against 28 people.
[02:59:47.170 --> 02:59:50.969]  They were running. They were all running for the Republican primary because whoever won that primary is going to win.
[02:59:51.329 --> 02:59:53.049]  I think it's a Trump plus 48.
[02:59:53.290 --> 02:59:54.610]  Whoever wins gets 48.
[02:59:54.870 --> 02:59:56.129]  48 points start.
[02:59:56.909 --> 02:59:59.629]  And not only did he win, he won easily.
[02:59:59.750 --> 03:00:04.649]  And now he's one of the most popular people in Congress and one of the most talented, maybe more importantly.
[03:00:05.350 --> 03:00:06.489]  Ronnie Jackson.
[03:00:06.709 --> 03:00:09.450]  Ronnie. Where's Ronnie?
[03:00:10.729 --> 03:00:12.229]  Where is you? Okay.
[03:00:12.489 --> 03:00:17.010]  Thank you, Ronnie. And you got a lot of talent surrounding you there.
[03:00:18.139 --> 03:00:23.819]  I think it's very important, also, we're here for a reason, and that's to win, and to honor Cory.
[03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:25.420]  But Cory wants us to win, too.
[03:00:25.639 --> 03:00:41.840]  And there's a man in the audience that's been very much a career path, a little bit like J.D., a great student, a great, talented student, and fantastic in the military, then went out to be a tremendous success, one of the most successful people on Wall Street,
[03:00:41.940 --> 03:00:47.079]  actually. And he's tough, and he's smart, and he's going to make sure you always have fracking in Pennsylvania.
[03:00:47.819 --> 03:00:50.840]  And he's going to make sure you have many other things other than fracking.
[03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:53.200]  You have a senator that now does nothing.
[03:00:53.319 --> 03:00:56.639]  He does nothing. And he doesn't fight for you.
[03:00:56.700 --> 03:01:00.920]  He votes with Biden, if you can believe it, like 100 percent of the time.
[03:01:01.280 --> 03:01:04.379]  But this guy — and, you know, we're lucky that he does it.
[03:01:04.459 --> 03:01:07.280]  I don't know. He might not have done it if he had it to do again.
[03:01:07.280 --> 03:01:13.159]  I don't know. But I think he's just one of the most outstanding people anywhere in the country to run for office.
[03:01:13.790 --> 03:01:16.350]  We're lucky that he's doing it, and he's got a real shot.
[03:01:16.409 --> 03:01:17.750]  He's doing very well in the polls.
[03:01:17.930 --> 03:01:23.170]  It's hard to beat somebody that's been there a long time, but this is somebody that's been there a long time and did nothing.
[03:01:23.170 --> 03:01:28.750]  He did nothing. And his name is David McCormick, and he's great, and I hope he's going to be your next senator.
[03:01:32.069 --> 03:01:39.489]  And I see somebody else I didn't know he was here.
[03:01:39.649 --> 03:01:41.549]  Mike Kelly. I see Mike Kelly there.
[03:01:43.190 --> 03:01:45.270]  Stand up. Oh, boy, am I lucky.
[03:01:45.469 --> 03:01:47.430]  Am I lucky I spotted him?
[03:01:47.690 --> 03:01:50.809]  If I didn't spot you, I was in big trouble, right?
[03:01:51.049 --> 03:01:55.149]  This is a man who's beloved in this state, and he's fantastic.
[03:01:55.309 --> 03:01:56.950]  So, thank you, Mike. Thank you.
[03:01:58.409 --> 03:02:03.329]  We also have some terrific people from law enforcement.
[03:02:03.590 --> 03:02:06.069]  Butler County Sheriff Mike Sloop.
[03:02:09.389 --> 03:02:10.850]  Thank you, Mike. Great job.
[03:02:10.969 --> 03:02:12.440]  Thank you. Thank you, Mike.
[03:02:12.600 --> 03:02:14.280]  Thank you for your help, too, I could tell you.
[03:02:14.479 --> 03:02:16.680]  Thank you for your help. I can say that.
[03:02:16.920 --> 03:02:21.120]  Thank you very much. Butler County Commissioner Leslie Oshie.
[03:02:22.040 --> 03:02:23.180]  Leslie, thank you.
[03:02:23.540 --> 03:02:25.120]  Thank you, Leslie. Great job.
[03:02:26.159 --> 03:02:27.799]  RNC Chairman Michael Watley.
[03:02:27.940 --> 03:02:29.500]  This guy is doing a great job.
[03:02:30.719 --> 03:02:33.420]  He's doing great. Came from North Carolina.
[03:02:33.559 --> 03:02:34.799]  We won North Carolina.
[03:02:36.770 --> 03:02:41.770]  He kept their cheating down to a minimum, and we were able to win it, and we were solid all night long.
[03:02:41.930 --> 03:02:47.709]  And he's great, but if we don't have good results by the 6th of November, I will never say that about him again.
[03:02:49.510 --> 03:02:50.809]  No, he's a great guy.
[03:02:50.889 --> 03:02:51.930]  He's working very hard.
[03:02:52.129 --> 03:02:53.750]  24 hours a day he's working.
[03:02:53.930 --> 03:02:57.170]  I know that. And he's working mostly on stop the steal.
[03:02:57.409 --> 03:02:58.430]  Because we have a lot of votes.
[03:02:58.530 --> 03:03:00.649]  We have plenty of votes. Stop the steal.
[03:03:00.909 --> 03:03:02.729]  That's why you've got to get out.
[03:03:02.870 --> 03:03:04.209]  You've got to get out and vote.
[03:03:04.309 --> 03:03:08.510]  We're going to win this thing. And the more we win it, you know, it's too big to rig.
[03:03:08.649 --> 03:03:09.909]  You know the expression we use?
[03:03:10.030 --> 03:03:12.010]  Make it too big to rig. You know, at a certain point...
[03:03:12.559 --> 03:03:15.319]  Elon would understand this better than anybody statistically.
[03:03:15.620 --> 03:03:18.979]  At a certain point, their cheating doesn't matter.
[03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:21.459]  And we want to make it too big to rig.
[03:03:21.620 --> 03:03:27.340]  And we also have somebody that's very special, the co-chair of the Republican Party, Lara Trump.
[03:03:27.540 --> 03:03:30.239]  Thank you. Lara, thanks.
[03:03:36.879 --> 03:03:43.219]  And, you know, oftentimes with families, they say, oh, you know, why did you put that one in or this one in and all the different people?
[03:03:43.299 --> 03:03:44.680]  So many people have problems with that.
[03:03:44.879 --> 03:03:47.959]  In her case, everyone said, how the hell did you get her to do it?
[03:03:48.340 --> 03:03:49.899]  She has been unbelievable.
[03:03:50.159 --> 03:03:56.319]  So thank you very much. Comes from North Carolina, and I have a feeling she's going to be spending some time down there a little bit.
[03:03:56.840 --> 03:04:01.079]  And she's married to my wonderful son, Eric, who's right here.
[03:04:01.219 --> 03:04:02.479]  So, Eric, please stand up.
[03:04:11.440 --> 03:04:12.620]  He's a great guy.
[03:04:13.500 --> 03:04:14.700]  Eric has a distinction.
[03:04:15.360 --> 03:04:20.559]  He has gotten more subpoenas than any man in the history of our country by about 10 times.
[03:04:21.239 --> 03:04:23.860]  Every day Congress would meet, they'd send him a subpoena.
[03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:25.780]  What is it about? They have no idea.
[03:04:26.610 --> 03:04:29.969]  But I think he's got the all-time record and he's handled it all beautifully.
[03:04:30.170 --> 03:04:32.010]  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
[03:04:32.290 --> 03:04:42.709]  A friend of mine, a great, great businessman, one of the most respected people, and he made a big, big contribution yesterday to Georgia and a big contribution to North Carolina.
[03:04:42.909 --> 03:04:44.090]  Steve Whitcoff is here.
[03:04:47.750 --> 03:04:48.969]  Hi, Steve. Thanks.
[03:04:50.319 --> 03:04:58.040]  And another man who's one of the greatest businessmen in the country, he actually said that if Trump doesn't win, this country is going to go into a massive depression.
[03:04:58.059 --> 03:05:02.840]  Well, I don't know about that, but he has been a very good predictor, I will say that.
[03:05:03.579 --> 03:05:08.920]  And truly one of the greats, one of the great pickers, picker meaning stocks, he knows what he's doing.
[03:05:09.399 --> 03:05:12.440]  And highly respected by everybody, John Paulson.
[03:05:12.620 --> 03:05:13.659]  Thank you, John. Great.
[03:05:14.860 --> 03:05:24.209]  Great guy. And we have so many others, and I won't do it because we have to really get out of here before it gets too cold for people.
[03:05:24.389 --> 03:05:32.790]  But I just — and I love it much better because this one teleprompter — not that I use the teleprompters too much — isn't it nice to have a president that doesn't need a teleprompter?
[03:05:38.069 --> 03:05:40.610]  No, we don't need it.
[03:05:40.770 --> 03:05:43.750]  But this one was right smack in the sun.
[03:05:44.469 --> 03:05:46.069]  Great job back there, fellas.
[03:05:47.090 --> 03:05:49.129]  They said the teleprompters are working fine.
[03:05:49.290 --> 03:05:52.989]  Well, thank goodness. Did you see what happened the other day with the teleprompter with her?
[03:05:53.209 --> 03:05:54.610]  That was not a pretty sight.
[03:05:55.110 --> 03:05:57.350]  The teleprompter went off and she went off too.
[03:05:57.430 --> 03:05:58.590]  She didn't know what the hell happened.
[03:06:00.950 --> 03:06:04.049]  And you know, teleprompters are very dangerous because they go off a lot.
[03:06:04.250 --> 03:06:06.190]  You have to be prepared for them to go off.
[03:06:06.270 --> 03:06:09.170]  Go blank. You'll have 100,000 people.
[03:06:09.290 --> 03:06:10.889]  You have 75,000 people.
[03:06:10.969 --> 03:06:14.229]  You have this. And if the teleprompter goes off, you got to be able to move.
[03:06:14.409 --> 03:06:15.610]  She did not move well.
[03:06:16.129 --> 03:06:17.950]  This was not a good situation.
[03:06:19.250 --> 03:06:25.090]  But three more heroes from July 13th who rendered first aid to Corey incredibly.
[03:06:25.350 --> 03:06:26.829]  Dr. Jim Sweetland.
[03:06:30.710 --> 03:06:34.389]  Rico Elmore, who was unbelievable.
[03:06:36.469 --> 03:06:38.090]  Rico, you were unbelievable.
[03:06:38.950 --> 03:06:40.270]  He ran over.
[03:06:41.370 --> 03:06:56.370]  National Guard. He ran over and grabbed Corey, and Corey was still living, and he was doing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a man who was really in bad shape like nobody's ever seen, and his family appreciates it, and I do,
[03:06:56.430 --> 03:06:58.170]  too. So thank you, Rico, very much.
[03:06:58.469 --> 03:07:00.459]  Right? Amazing.
[03:07:01.200 --> 03:07:03.399]  Amazing. Amazing the people that we have.
[03:07:03.620 --> 03:07:06.120]  And you learn about them under times like this.
[03:07:06.200 --> 03:07:09.440]  That's when you really learn. So we're going to be seeing Rico again.
[03:07:09.739 --> 03:07:12.120]  And Ed Sheer, fantastic job.
[03:07:12.219 --> 03:07:13.719]  Thank you, Ed. We appreciate it.
[03:07:13.819 --> 03:07:15.760]  Thank you, Ed. Thank you.
[03:07:16.059 --> 03:07:17.299]  Thank you very much, Ed.
[03:07:17.500 --> 03:07:25.799]  Great job. In addition, this evening, we have to send our prayers and support to all the families affected by Hurricane Helene.
[03:07:26.530 --> 03:07:33.610]  This has been the worst hurricane response by a president and vice president since Katrina, and this is simply not acceptable.
[03:07:33.829 --> 03:07:38.729]  Those people, I was there yesterday with North Carolina and Georgia, and I'll tell you.
[03:07:38.790 --> 03:07:41.450]  And by the way, the governor of Georgia is doing an excellent job.
[03:07:41.610 --> 03:07:48.049]  Excellent job. But we have other people that aren't doing a good job, and we have to have them do a good job.
[03:07:48.670 --> 03:07:50.989]  But the federal government is doing a very bad job.
[03:07:51.129 --> 03:07:52.350]  They are not doing the job.
[03:07:52.489 --> 03:07:58.430]  And we have death and destruction that we haven't seen maybe ever.
[03:07:58.530 --> 03:07:59.549]  It's a real bad one.
[03:07:59.629 --> 03:08:00.829]  And they have to get people there.
[03:08:01.129 --> 03:08:02.389]  Because they don't have people there.
[03:08:02.430 --> 03:08:08.190]  They don't have the people. Kamala wined and dined in San Francisco and all of the people in North Carolina.
[03:08:08.350 --> 03:08:09.950]  No helicopters. No rescue.
[03:08:10.790 --> 03:08:13.750]  It's just what's happened there is very bad.
[03:08:13.909 --> 03:08:18.629]  They're offering them $750 to people whose homes have been washed away.
[03:08:20.809 --> 03:08:26.629]  And yet we send tens of billions of dollars to foreign countries that most people have never heard of.
[03:08:27.329 --> 03:08:29.170]  They're offering them $750.
[03:08:29.569 --> 03:08:31.809]  They've been destroyed. These people have been destroyed.
[03:08:32.750 --> 03:08:36.969]  The one young lady washed — you saw that with her son?
[03:08:37.110 --> 03:08:41.110]  I mean, pretty — I wish I never saw it, but just washed away.
[03:08:41.209 --> 03:08:43.250]  Your son was washed away with the grandparents.
[03:08:43.649 --> 03:08:45.229]  And so sad.
[03:08:45.829 --> 03:08:48.049]  And they're offering, they're giving them $750.
[03:08:48.670 --> 03:08:56.690]  And think of it. We give foreign countries hundreds of billions of dollars and we're handing North Carolina $750.
[03:08:58.190 --> 03:09:05.930]  If you want a president who won't even try to save you when the floodwaters are rising, vote for Kamala.
[03:09:06.090 --> 03:09:07.110]  She's not the right person.
[03:09:07.250 --> 03:09:10.549]  Look, you know what? If they were, if they did a good job, I wouldn't have run.
[03:09:10.670 --> 03:09:12.649]  To be honest with you, I didn't need to do this.
[03:09:12.750 --> 03:09:18.350]  I didn't need to. If I thought they were doing an even modestly good job, I wouldn't have run.
[03:09:18.530 --> 03:09:21.170]  But I saw right from the beginning, grossly incompetent.
[03:09:21.250 --> 03:09:22.329]  And I was right about that.
[03:09:22.450 --> 03:09:23.629]  And I decided to run.
[03:09:24.399 --> 03:09:26.180]  And we're doing really well.
[03:09:26.340 --> 03:09:27.639]  I was telling you about polls.
[03:09:27.799 --> 03:09:29.100]  We're way up in some polls.
[03:09:29.280 --> 03:09:30.600]  We're up in other polls.
[03:09:31.100 --> 03:09:32.440]  And we're the swing states.
[03:09:32.579 --> 03:09:39.920]  I think most of them have us up in every single swing state, including the great commonwealth of a place called Pennsylvania.
[03:09:44.430 --> 03:09:49.989]  And don't ever not call it a commonwealth, because I've seen people call it a state, and that's the end of them.
[03:09:50.370 --> 03:09:53.090]  That's practically the end of their political career.
[03:09:53.209 --> 03:09:55.030]  You've got to be very careful with Pennsylvania.
[03:09:55.510 --> 03:09:56.850]  It's that commonwealth.
[03:09:57.010 --> 03:09:58.110]  I haven't made that mistake.
[03:09:58.209 --> 03:10:00.430]  I don't want to either. It was not a pretty picture.
[03:10:01.110 --> 03:10:10.329]  If you want a president who will stop at nothing to protect you and your family, I hope you're going to vote for a gentleman named Donald J. Trump.
[03:10:10.709 --> 03:10:11.809]  Have you heard of him?
[03:10:13.459 --> 03:10:21.600]  Together we will rebuild Western North Carolina, rural Georgia, and every other state that's been so badly affected.
[03:10:21.760 --> 03:10:22.860]  That includes Alabama.
[03:10:23.299 --> 03:10:25.399]  Virginia was very hit hard.
[03:10:26.340 --> 03:10:28.420]  South Carolina was hit very hard.
[03:10:28.559 --> 03:10:31.719]  Florida. So many states.
[03:10:31.879 --> 03:10:33.420]  Tennessee was hit really hard.
[03:10:34.079 --> 03:10:36.340]  They were all hit. And we're going to work with them.
[03:10:36.520 --> 03:10:41.260]  And, you know, the next president is going to be the one that really, once they get, they got to get this done.
[03:10:41.459 --> 03:10:45.239]  But once that happens, the next president is going to be the one that has to really help them.
[03:10:45.540 --> 03:10:47.319]  And J.D. will be there to help them.
[03:10:47.340 --> 03:10:54.409]  I know that. 2024 is the most important election in the history of our country.
[03:10:55.170 --> 03:11:03.389]  And here are the facts. My opponent, Kamala Harris, is the most incompetent and far-left nominee ever to run for president.
[03:11:03.610 --> 03:11:07.610]  You know, she's much further left than crazy Bernie Sanders.
[03:11:07.729 --> 03:11:10.670]  You know that. She wants to open borders.
[03:11:10.829 --> 03:11:16.870]  She took the most secure border in U.S. history and turned it into the worst border in the history of the world.
[03:11:17.149 --> 03:11:19.110]  Remember, she was appointed border czar.
[03:11:19.250 --> 03:11:22.510]  She says she wasn't now after three years, but she was.
[03:11:22.729 --> 03:11:25.489]  But whether she was or not, she was in charge of the border.
[03:11:26.149 --> 03:11:29.370]  And the other day I saw her get up and say, we will do this, we will do that.
[03:11:29.870 --> 03:11:31.670]  Why didn't they do it four years ago?
[03:11:31.770 --> 03:11:36.229]  Why didn't they do it? The damage is so bad and so it's been done.
[03:11:36.930 --> 03:11:48.969]  She let in 21 million illegal aliens from all over the world, from prisons and jails and mental institutions and insane asylums and their terrorists at record levels, at levels we've never seen before.
[03:11:49.590 --> 03:11:54.129]  She costs you $29,000 a family through inflation price hikes.
[03:11:54.739 --> 03:11:56.860]  And now she wants a larger tax hike.
[03:11:57.040 --> 03:12:00.180]  She wants to go to the largest tax hike in American history.
[03:12:00.319 --> 03:12:03.760]  There's never been a tax hike like what she's proposing.
[03:12:04.180 --> 03:12:08.079]  She's going to raise your taxes a minimum of $3,000.
[03:12:08.819 --> 03:12:10.000]  She's a big taxer.
[03:12:10.579 --> 03:12:13.899]  And she was the original creator of Defund the Police.
[03:12:14.180 --> 03:12:21.139]  I think for all the sheriffs over here, if you're a partner in Defund the Police for even two days, you cannot be president.
[03:12:21.459 --> 03:12:24.059]  But she was one of the founders of Defund the Police.
[03:12:24.260 --> 03:12:25.700]  And she still believes that, by the way.
[03:12:25.959 --> 03:12:28.639]  I don't know how anybody could, but she still believes that.
[03:12:28.739 --> 03:12:32.059]  And if she ever had a chance, there's a good possibility she should go back to it.
[03:12:32.440 --> 03:12:35.420]  Can you imagine? Somebody's robbing our house.
[03:12:35.500 --> 03:12:37.079]  Well, there's nothing we can do about it.
[03:12:37.409 --> 03:12:38.709]  That's what they say.
[03:12:39.290 --> 03:12:40.329]  You know, they tried it.
[03:12:40.950 --> 03:12:44.780]  And you know where they tried it? In Minnesota with our Vice President.
[03:12:45.239 --> 03:12:47.079]  And it wasn't working out too well.
[03:12:47.319 --> 03:12:49.899]  It was working out very well for the robbers and the criminals.
[03:12:50.059 --> 03:12:52.219]  That's the only one it was working out well for.
[03:12:52.639 --> 03:12:57.840]  Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. She wants mass amnesty and citizenship for illegals.
[03:12:58.500 --> 03:13:11.639]  And worst of all, she lost — and this is maybe the worst thing in the whole, that nobody talks to fake news, won't mention it — she lost more than 325,000 migrant children that are now dead in slavery.
[03:13:12.329 --> 03:13:16.530]  Or just plain missing, probably never to be seen again, never to see their parents again.
[03:13:17.110 --> 03:13:28.930]  But this isn't like, this is 325,000 have been lost She praised the idea of a 70% to an 80% tax rate.
[03:13:29.069 --> 03:13:35.969]  She imposed a natural gas export ban on Pennsylvania, which is killing your energy workers and your pricing.
[03:13:36.129 --> 03:13:44.010]  You know, you have one of the highest energy costs in the country and yet you're sitting on top of a massive amount of energy that she doesn't want to get.
[03:13:45.610 --> 03:13:50.229]  It's been a disaster for your state, and now she's vowed repeatedly.
[03:13:50.389 --> 03:13:52.110]  Now, all of a sudden, she changed her mind.
[03:13:52.270 --> 03:13:56.790]  But when, you know, with politicians, it's always the first statement that comes out to be the one they want.
[03:13:57.110 --> 03:14:00.870]  So she spent 14 years knocking fracking.
[03:14:01.090 --> 03:14:02.430]  We're never going to have fracking.
[03:14:02.569 --> 03:14:06.389]  We're not going to frack. All of a sudden, a little while ago, she came, I love fracking very much.
[03:14:06.549 --> 03:14:07.870]  No, she'll go back to it.
[03:14:08.129 --> 03:14:14.709]  And she even endorsed free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention at taxpayer expense.
[03:14:16.540 --> 03:14:18.260]  I don't think Elon likes that idea.
[03:14:18.399 --> 03:14:21.319]  These are not ideas that Elon Musk likes too much.
[03:14:22.040 --> 03:14:26.360]  And it was just announced yesterday in California, and he took this one from me.
[03:14:26.399 --> 03:14:39.450]  I'm so upset. But think of it, that the far less than average governor, Gavin Newsom, Has banned any and all ID requirements from voting and registering to vote.
[03:14:39.750 --> 03:14:42.649]  You're not even allowed to mention the fact, Ilan.
[03:14:42.930 --> 03:14:44.790]  You're not allowed to mention the fact.
[03:14:44.909 --> 03:14:49.270]  You can't say, may I see your ID? If you do, it's a criminal act.
[03:14:49.450 --> 03:14:52.290]  This is like, this is a takeover of the country.
[03:14:52.510 --> 03:14:56.870]  You're not allowed to ask for an ID. If you do, it's a criminal count.
[03:14:57.579 --> 03:14:59.719]  Other Democrat states are following.
[03:14:59.959 --> 03:15:01.639]  This is only so they can cheat.
[03:15:01.920 --> 03:15:06.760]  There's only one thing that you do this for so that you can cheat on elections.
[03:15:07.120 --> 03:15:08.819]  There's no other conceivable reason.
[03:15:09.100 --> 03:15:12.079]  Kamala Harris is a radical left Marxist.
[03:15:12.139 --> 03:15:15.930]  She is a Woman that's not respected in Congress.
[03:15:16.149 --> 03:15:17.510]  She was laughed at at Congress.
[03:15:17.750 --> 03:15:18.889]  Nobody thought she could win.
[03:15:19.329 --> 03:15:21.549]  You know, they did a coup.
[03:15:22.409 --> 03:15:25.450]  Whether you like them or not, I'm not a particularly big fan.
[03:15:25.930 --> 03:15:28.149]  But we had a debate.
[03:15:28.879 --> 03:15:33.260]  And the debate ended and all of a sudden they come to him and they say, we want you out.
[03:15:33.360 --> 03:15:34.420]  You're not going to win the election.
[03:15:34.760 --> 03:15:36.219]  And he said, I don't want to get out.
[03:15:36.280 --> 03:15:37.420]  He got 14 million votes.
[03:15:37.500 --> 03:15:42.959]  If you believe in democracy or a system, he got 14 million votes and she got none.
[03:15:43.079 --> 03:15:47.219]  She was the first one out, 22 candidates, and she never made it to Iowa.
[03:15:47.379 --> 03:15:50.500]  She quit before Iowa and now she's running and that's okay.
[03:15:50.959 --> 03:15:54.780]  But, you know, we spent $150 million beating Biden.
[03:15:55.020 --> 03:15:59.799]  And as soon as he was down and out for the count, They said, let's take him out.
[03:15:59.899 --> 03:16:01.040]  We'll give somebody else to run.
[03:16:01.120 --> 03:16:04.280]  Never happened before. We do a lot of firsts, I will tell you.
[03:16:04.479 --> 03:16:05.719]  We do a lot of firsts.
[03:16:05.780 --> 03:16:11.959]  But she's a person that rated even worse in every statistic than any other senator.
[03:16:12.120 --> 03:16:21.350]  She was rated at the bottom of the U.S. Senate She's destroyed everything she touched, but the good news is that we have a plan to fix it.
[03:16:21.430 --> 03:16:23.069]  We're going to fix it. We're going to fix it fast.
[03:16:23.629 --> 03:16:26.110]  Nobody is going to stand for open borders.
[03:16:26.329 --> 03:16:28.569]  Nobody is going to stand for a bad military.
[03:16:29.389 --> 03:16:33.770]  Nobody is going to stand for education that's not proper.
[03:16:34.229 --> 03:16:38.129]  We're moving education back to the States.
[03:16:38.309 --> 03:16:39.709]  You're going to be running your own education.
[03:16:41.500 --> 03:16:45.899]  So we have, you know, an education so important is what's more important than education.
[03:16:46.159 --> 03:16:48.440]  But we rank at the bottom of every list.
[03:16:48.739 --> 03:16:50.959]  They rank 40 major countries.
[03:16:51.020 --> 03:16:52.040]  We're at the bottom.
[03:16:52.299 --> 03:16:55.719]  But we're top of the list as the cost per pupil.
[03:16:55.860 --> 03:17:01.940]  We spend more per pupil, per student, than any other country anywhere in the world.
[03:17:02.139 --> 03:17:07.260]  So we're number one in that, and we're number 38, 39, or 40 every single time.
[03:17:07.950 --> 03:17:13.030]  And you have Denmark, you have Sweden, you have Norway, you have China.
[03:17:13.309 --> 03:17:14.350]  It's always the top five.
[03:17:14.450 --> 03:17:16.069]  Can you believe it? China's the top five.
[03:17:16.190 --> 03:17:22.229]  That's amazing. But we're going to move our education back to the States.
[03:17:22.709 --> 03:17:34.049]  So places like Indiana and Iowa and Idaho and States that you don't even hear too much of because they're so good and so well-run, they're going to run their own education.
[03:17:34.229 --> 03:17:35.670]  And you know what's going to come out of that?
[03:17:35.809 --> 03:17:40.569]  A Denmark, a Norway, a Sweden, maybe, I don't even know, China.
[03:17:41.090 --> 03:17:46.389]  Can you imagine China with 1.4 billion people as a top five?
[03:17:46.610 --> 03:17:48.530]  And we're close to 40.
[03:17:48.649 --> 03:17:49.850]  We are 40 sometimes.
[03:17:50.569 --> 03:17:55.629]  Starting on day one, I will seal the border and stop the migrant invasion into our country.
[03:17:57.110 --> 03:18:02.250]  We will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of the United States.
[03:18:02.450 --> 03:18:05.530]  Dwight Eisenhower right now has that record.
[03:18:07.489 --> 03:18:09.690]  And by the way, it's not something I want to do.
[03:18:09.790 --> 03:18:12.129]  I dread having to do it, but we have no choice.
[03:18:12.510 --> 03:18:20.989]  What they've done to our country is not even believable, especially the criminals, the criminal element that's in our country.
[03:18:21.229 --> 03:18:26.930]  And again, all over the world, crime rates are down because they've taken their criminals and they've dumped them into the United States.
[03:18:27.110 --> 03:18:29.010]  And you know what? I would have been worse than them.
[03:18:29.090 --> 03:18:30.510]  I would have had it done even faster.
[03:18:31.229 --> 03:18:34.569]  They've dumped them into the United States of America, and that's what we have.
[03:18:34.690 --> 03:18:35.889]  And it's dangerous out there.
[03:18:35.969 --> 03:18:38.329]  We're getting them out. We're getting them out quickly.
[03:18:38.530 --> 03:18:42.829]  And we will defeat inflation, and we will make America affordable again.
[03:18:42.909 --> 03:18:44.610]  And it's going to start with liquid gold.
[03:18:44.750 --> 03:18:53.750]  We have more liquid gold, oil and gas under our feet than any nation in the world, including Saudi Arabia and Russia.
[03:18:54.569 --> 03:18:58.930]  We will become energy independent like we were just four years ago.
[03:18:59.049 --> 03:19:01.049]  You know, four years ago, we were energy independent.
[03:19:01.250 --> 03:19:05.870]  Can you believe it? And then we were going to become energy dominant.
[03:19:06.129 --> 03:19:10.250]  We will be dominant within a matter of months, and we will make so much money.
[03:19:10.489 --> 03:19:13.229]  We are going to drill, baby, drill.
[03:19:18.159 --> 03:19:22.200]  And we will again open ANWR. Ronald Reagan tried to do it.
[03:19:22.319 --> 03:19:26.479]  Every single president from before Reagan tried to do it, and I got it done.
[03:19:27.159 --> 03:19:30.319]  ANWR is the largest drilling site anywhere in the world.
[03:19:30.459 --> 03:19:35.079]  It could be larger, could be larger than Saudi Arabia, could be larger than Russia.
[03:19:35.139 --> 03:19:38.569]  It's in Alaska. And I got it done, and we worked to get it done.
[03:19:38.690 --> 03:19:46.110]  And one of the first things he did was terminate ANWR. And that was going to take care of all of Asia.
[03:19:46.190 --> 03:19:49.030]  That was going to make us so much money, we would have paid off debt.
[03:19:49.670 --> 03:19:52.270]  I gave you the biggest tax reduction in history.
[03:19:52.469 --> 03:19:54.729]  You would have gotten even a bigger one.
[03:19:54.829 --> 03:19:56.930]  You were going to be just very happy.
[03:19:57.030 --> 03:19:58.829]  You were going to say, I like that guy very much.
[03:19:59.340 --> 03:20:03.780]  Twenty million Americans are behind on their electric bills right now, which just announced.
[03:20:04.040 --> 03:20:09.180]  Twenty million Americans, they're struggling to pay their monthly bills at a record rate.
[03:20:09.319 --> 03:20:10.860]  There's never been anything like it.
[03:20:11.079 --> 03:20:19.500]  And it's all because of their anti-U.S. energy regime, which has caused Pennsylvania electricity prices to raise almost 50 percent.
[03:20:20.209 --> 03:20:23.889]  We will cut energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months.
[03:20:24.250 --> 03:20:30.409]  We will have your energy prices, your air conditioning, heating, cars if you buy a Tesla, which is good.
[03:20:31.530 --> 03:20:36.870]  It's good. We will have your energy prices cut in half.
[03:20:37.190 --> 03:20:43.069]  It'll be cut in half within a period of one year from January 20th, which is the day we take office.
[03:20:43.229 --> 03:20:44.629]  And that's going to save you a lot of money.
[03:20:44.809 --> 03:20:49.469]  And that's going to, in turn, bring down the prices of everything.
[03:20:49.729 --> 03:20:53.049]  Because, you know, more than anything else, people tell me about the groceries.
[03:20:53.489 --> 03:20:54.850]  The groceries are groceries.
[03:20:55.590 --> 03:20:57.590]  And what they're talking about is food.
[03:20:57.809 --> 03:20:59.829]  Everything's going to be coming down when we do that.
[03:20:59.969 --> 03:21:14.030]  We're also going to get your interest rates We will bring automobile manufacturing back to the United States at levels never seen before, and we will turn the United States into a manufacturing superpower again.
[03:21:14.170 --> 03:21:15.829]  It hasn't been there in many, many years.
[03:21:17.219 --> 03:21:19.159]  We had it started four years ago.
[03:21:19.340 --> 03:21:27.139]  The centerpiece of my plan for a manufacturing renaissance will be a 15 percent made in America corporate tax rate.
[03:21:27.219 --> 03:21:31.579]  In other words, if you make your product in the United States, you get a rate.
[03:21:31.780 --> 03:21:35.280]  So I cut it from 39 percent to 21 percent.
[03:21:35.379 --> 03:21:36.540]  Everyone said that was impossible.
[03:21:36.620 --> 03:21:40.659]  I got it done. And we had the best boom we've ever had.
[03:21:40.840 --> 03:21:45.219]  We did more revenue when we had it at 21 than when it was at 39.
[03:21:45.459 --> 03:21:48.440]  Think of it much more. The following year, we did much more.
[03:21:48.680 --> 03:21:55.680]  And then I'm going to take it from 21 to 15, which will make us the most competitive country in the world.
[03:21:58.520 --> 03:22:00.819]  Nobody will be able to compete with us.
[03:22:01.719 --> 03:22:06.959]  But that 15 rate only goes for those who make their product in America.
[03:22:07.100 --> 03:22:09.540]  They have to make their product here, otherwise they pay 21.
[03:22:10.469 --> 03:22:18.549]  And we will protect those companies moving into America and all of our existing companies with stiff tariffs placed on companies that don't move in.
[03:22:18.709 --> 03:22:22.270]  If they don't come in, if they don't want to make their product here, that's fine, but they're going to be tariffed.
[03:22:22.469 --> 03:22:25.930]  We have to protect our companies, and that's what we're going to do.
[03:22:26.229 --> 03:22:32.110]  The only way they can get out of paying those tariffs is to build their plants and factories in America.
[03:22:32.450 --> 03:22:35.209]  We may even be able to get Elon to build some of them.
[03:22:35.209 --> 03:22:39.909]  I think we will. And hire American workers for the job.
[03:22:40.250 --> 03:22:42.850]  We're going to hire American workers for the job.
[03:22:42.969 --> 03:22:45.850]  We will pass the Reciprocal Trade Act.
[03:22:46.049 --> 03:22:55.670]  If China or any other country charges us 100 or 200 percent tax, then we will likewise charge them a 100 or 200 percent tax.
[03:22:55.829 --> 03:23:00.290]  We had a lot of problems on that one with the Senate, and we're going to get that done.
[03:23:01.010 --> 03:23:03.430]  Think of it. They charge us, and we don't charge them.
[03:23:03.870 --> 03:23:06.850]  Now, they charge us, we're going to charge them the same thing.
[03:23:07.069 --> 03:23:08.250]  Reciprocal. It's reciprocal.
[03:23:09.190 --> 03:23:18.489]  I will not let Mexico, China, or any other country sell cars into the United States to the detriment of our autoworkers who will do better than they have ever done.
[03:23:18.649 --> 03:23:24.250]  We're going to bring back the car business like it was 50, 60, and 70 years ago.
[03:23:24.690 --> 03:23:26.290]  Everyone's going to want to be back here.
[03:23:27.729 --> 03:23:34.270]  And I will not approve Japan buying U.S. steel 70 years ago, the greatest company anywhere in the world.
[03:23:34.950 --> 03:23:39.729]  It was the greatest company anywhere in the world, and now we have Japan buying U.S. steel.
[03:23:39.790 --> 03:23:47.209]  I don't like that. We will deliver massive tax cuts for workers, and we will have a policy that I think is so great.
[03:23:47.510 --> 03:23:49.770]  No tax on tips.
[03:23:52.370 --> 03:23:54.709]  No tax on overtime.
[03:23:57.329 --> 03:24:00.950]  And no tax on Social Security for our great seniors.
[03:24:01.389 --> 03:24:06.049]  No tax. And you know, when you think of it, our seniors were hurt so badly.
[03:24:07.319 --> 03:24:08.920]  Inflation has killed our seniors.
[03:24:09.120 --> 03:24:12.540]  You know, they have a fixed income, and it's just got worse and worse every week, every month.
[03:24:12.680 --> 03:24:15.040]  It's gotten worse and worse, and it's just horrible.
[03:24:15.280 --> 03:24:16.459]  And they haven't gone down.
[03:24:16.579 --> 03:24:19.139]  They've only gone up. Prices have still only gone up.
[03:24:19.500 --> 03:24:25.219]  And while working Americans catch up, we're going to put a temporary cap on the credit card interest rates at 10%.
[03:24:25.219 --> 03:24:29.200]  People are paying 28% interest, 25% interest.
[03:24:30.350 --> 03:24:33.790]  I will always protect Social Security and Medicare with no cuts.
[03:24:33.889 --> 03:24:47.309]  We're not going to do anything with Social Security, but they're going to destroy Social Security because all of the migrants coming in are going on between Medicare, Social Security, other programs, and nobody is able to afford it.
[03:24:47.350 --> 03:24:48.909]  I will settle the war in Ukraine.
[03:24:49.090 --> 03:24:58.989]  I will end the chaos in the Middle East, and I will prevent, I promise you, World War III. We're not going to have World War III. And right now, we're very close to having it.
[03:24:59.750 --> 03:25:02.309]  We will lead the world in space exploration.
[03:25:02.610 --> 03:25:09.889]  Thank you, Elon. We will lead the world in military and we will reach Mars before the end of my term.
[03:25:10.270 --> 03:25:12.149]  Elon promised me he was going to do that.
[03:25:12.329 --> 03:25:13.489]  I don't know. Can you do that?
[03:25:13.909 --> 03:25:15.829]  Stand up. Can we do that?
[03:25:16.049 --> 03:25:17.069]  He wants to reach it.
[03:25:18.010 --> 03:25:19.090]  I think he's going to do it.
[03:25:19.290 --> 03:25:20.309]  JD, work on him.
[03:25:20.969 --> 03:25:28.780]  Work on him. Work on him.
[03:25:28.920 --> 03:25:30.479]  JD is working on Elon.
[03:25:30.760 --> 03:25:37.100]  Now, he told me that we're going to win, and he's going to reach Mars by the end of our term, which is a big thing.
[03:25:37.280 --> 03:25:40.340]  Before China, before anybody, right?
[03:25:40.500 --> 03:25:43.180]  And my money's on that guy right there.
[03:25:43.420 --> 03:25:48.940]  We will rebuild our cities, including Washington, D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again.
[03:25:49.159 --> 03:25:52.920]  And we will keep the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency.
[03:25:53.120 --> 03:25:54.579]  It's losing right now.
[03:25:55.739 --> 03:25:58.020]  It's losing right now, but I'll be able to do it.
[03:25:58.100 --> 03:26:01.100]  Other people won't. I'll tell these countries as they leave us.
[03:26:01.500 --> 03:26:03.860]  I say, you want to do business in the United States?
[03:26:04.040 --> 03:26:06.579]  You're going back into the reserve currency.
[03:26:06.840 --> 03:26:12.360]  And if you don't, we're going to charge you a big, fat, beautiful tax to do business in the United States.
[03:26:12.700 --> 03:26:17.840]  And they're going to say, I would love very much to go back into the U.S. reserve currency.
[03:26:18.319 --> 03:26:20.860]  No, we're going to save it. But these people aren't going to save it.
[03:26:20.940 --> 03:26:22.020]  They don't know how to talk.
[03:26:22.479 --> 03:26:35.260]  They don't know how to think. Together, we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, and low inflation so that everyone can afford groceries, a beautiful car, and a home.
[03:26:35.719 --> 03:26:38.159]  Very basic. It's very basic.
[03:26:38.739 --> 03:26:51.069]  We will stop the invasion, end migrant crimes, strengthen our military, build a missile defense shield around our country, Keep critical race theory and transgender insanity.
[03:26:51.989 --> 03:26:55.090]  We're gonna keep it the hell out of our school.
[03:26:56.569 --> 03:26:59.629]  We're gonna keep that insanity out of our school.
[03:27:00.030 --> 03:27:04.389]  And as I said, we will keep men out of women's sports.
[03:27:06.750 --> 03:27:08.370]  So demeaning to women.
[03:27:08.950 --> 03:27:17.110]  You saw that in the Olympics, they have female boxing, women's boxing, and a young lady from Italy Very good boxer.
[03:27:17.290 --> 03:27:21.430]  Very, very good. She was all excited, but she played a person who transitioned.
[03:27:21.909 --> 03:27:22.969]  A person transitioned.
[03:27:23.270 --> 03:27:25.090]  A male transitioned to a female.
[03:27:25.909 --> 03:27:29.770]  And the young girl from Italy, beautiful young woman.
[03:27:29.850 --> 03:27:32.129]  I'm not allowed to say that anymore politically, but I'll say it.
[03:27:32.149 --> 03:27:33.329]  She was a beautiful young woman.
[03:27:33.590 --> 03:27:35.709]  If you say that, that's the end of your career, right?
[03:27:35.770 --> 03:27:38.370]  But it's not. If it is, so be it, okay?
[03:27:38.530 --> 03:27:39.850]  We've got to get back to real life.
[03:27:40.209 --> 03:27:45.659]  But this beautiful young lady is out, and She gets, boom, little jab, left jab.
[03:27:46.239 --> 03:27:48.899]  And she goes back, oh my, I've never been hit like that.
[03:27:48.959 --> 03:27:50.120]  This is just like a defensive.
[03:27:50.579 --> 03:27:54.360]  Then he goes, the coroner says, you can take her.
[03:27:55.100 --> 03:27:56.219]  So they push her out.
[03:27:56.500 --> 03:27:57.520]  Boom, another one.
[03:27:57.680 --> 03:27:58.719]  And she says, that's enough.
[03:27:58.719 --> 03:28:00.079]  I can't do it. I can't take it.
[03:28:00.200 --> 03:28:03.479]  I've never seen anything like that. So we had two people that transitioned.
[03:28:04.280 --> 03:28:07.399]  Both people, shockingly, won the gold medal in their division.
[03:28:07.639 --> 03:28:09.299]  So it's crazy.
[03:28:12.829 --> 03:28:15.610]  And if you look at weightlifting contests, they're the best of all.
[03:28:16.209 --> 03:28:26.290]  For years and years and years ago, they put an eighth of a pound on one side of the barbell, an eighth of a pound on the other, and they can't do it.
[03:28:26.389 --> 03:28:29.010]  And the record standing for 18 years, they just can't do it.
[03:28:29.549 --> 03:28:32.069]  And then a guy comes along who never lifted before.
[03:28:33.889 --> 03:28:37.229]  And he puts a hundred pounds on and he goes like this, like it's nothing.
[03:28:37.690 --> 03:28:40.290]  It's so demeaning to women.
[03:28:40.290 --> 03:28:42.389]  We're not going to allow it to happen.
[03:28:42.389 --> 03:28:46.250]  It's ending. No men playing in women's sports.
[03:28:46.489 --> 03:28:54.489]  And we will defend the Second Amendment, protect religious liberty, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections.
[03:28:54.909 --> 03:28:56.469]  Everyone will prosper.
[03:28:56.850 --> 03:28:58.750]  Every family will thrive.
[03:28:59.049 --> 03:29:02.090]  And every day will be filled with opportunity and hope.
[03:29:02.090 --> 03:29:03.290]  We need hope.
[03:29:03.909 --> 03:29:06.110]  We need the American dream back, don't we?
[03:29:06.209 --> 03:29:07.690]  We're going to have the American dream.
[03:29:08.569 --> 03:29:15.170]  We're going to have the American dream so every kid in your family is going to grow up and say, I want to be like Elon Musk.
[03:29:15.329 --> 03:29:19.090]  I want to have 200 billion in cash.
[03:29:20.040 --> 03:29:22.139]  I'm going to be like Elon Musk.
[03:29:22.239 --> 03:29:23.719]  That's the American dream.
[03:29:24.120 --> 03:29:34.159]  But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and we must stop her country destroying radical left agenda once and for all.
[03:29:34.280 --> 03:29:35.620]  We cannot have it happen.
[03:29:36.879 --> 03:29:39.520]  So you must get out and you must vote.
[03:29:41.020 --> 03:29:52.639]  Here in this incredible Commonwealth, we stand on the shoulders of generations of Pennsylvania patriots who gave everything they could, give every single thing for their rights and for their freedom.
[03:29:53.450 --> 03:30:00.690]  Pennsylvania is where our founding fathers declared American independence and sounded the beautiful Liberty Bell.
[03:30:01.069 --> 03:30:19.450]  It's where the Army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, where General George Washington led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware, and where generations of tough, strong, beautiful miners and steelworkers put Pennsylvania's spirit into every single thing they did.
[03:30:21.049 --> 03:30:35.510]  And from Gettysburg to Germantown and Philadelphia to Barren Hill and from Brandywine to right here in Butler, this is the place where Pennsylvania patriots poured out their blood with the love of their country.
[03:30:35.629 --> 03:30:37.250]  They love their country so much.
[03:30:37.950 --> 03:30:48.969]  And so, in honor of all those American heroes who came before us, we will press forward, we will push onward, and together we will win, win, win.
[03:30:49.170 --> 03:30:50.469]  We're going to win, win, win.
[03:30:51.889 --> 03:30:53.469]  Nothing will sway us.
[03:30:53.610 --> 03:30:55.030]  Nothing will slow us.
[03:30:55.209 --> 03:31:00.530]  And no one will ever stop us, no matter what dangers come our way.
[03:31:00.770 --> 03:31:07.590]  No matter what obstacles we must face, we will keep striving toward our magnificent American future.
[03:31:07.909 --> 03:31:08.989]  We will not fail.
[03:31:09.170 --> 03:31:11.190]  We will not allow ourselves to fail.
[03:31:11.729 --> 03:31:17.069]  From this day forward, we will always put America first, and we will take back and save the United States.
[03:31:17.750 --> 03:31:22.409]  November 5th, Election Day, will be the most important day in the history of our country.
[03:31:22.790 --> 03:31:29.670]  And together with the great people of Pennsylvania, we will make America powerful again.
[03:31:31.790 --> 03:31:35.610]  We will make America wealthy again.
[03:31:36.969 --> 03:31:40.569]  We will make America healthy again.
[03:31:41.170 --> 03:31:45.469]  We will make America strong again.
[03:31:46.819 --> 03:31:49.860]  We will make America proud again.
[03:31:50.639 --> 03:31:54.799]  We will make America safe again.
[03:31:55.159 --> 03:31:59.760]  And we will make America great again.
[03:32:00.120 --> 03:32:02.239]  Thank you, Pennsylvania. God bless you.
[03:32:02.760 --> 03:32:03.899]  God bless you, Pennsylvania.
[03:32:08.809 --> 03:32:20.530]  Donald J. Trump, President Trump back in Butler, Pennsylvania after the assassination attempt right there at that very same stage on July 13th, 2024.
[03:32:21.049 --> 03:32:24.329]  Amazing appearances from J.D. Vance, Elon Musk and others.
[03:32:25.350 --> 03:32:27.409]  Strong and wise words.
[03:32:27.690 --> 03:32:29.870]  I'm told 100,000 people were in the audience.
[03:32:30.030 --> 03:32:41.510]  It's absolutely amazing. We know that these leftists are trying to destroy America, that the globalists are trying to eradicate and erode all of our national sovereignty to the point where no individual nation ever exists again.
[03:32:41.590 --> 03:32:46.309]  And we are just one nation under one new world order, one world government.
[03:32:46.469 --> 03:32:50.610]  And that is why... Hundreds of thousands of people are showing up to rallies like that.
[03:32:50.690 --> 03:32:59.110]  It's why thousands upon thousands of people are showing up to Tucker Carlson events when Alex Jones appears and Jack Posobiec appears and other great American patriots appear.
[03:32:59.229 --> 03:33:03.930]  It's why the likes of Elon Musk and so many others are showing their support for Donald Trump.
[03:33:04.049 --> 03:33:07.729]  And it's why it's more important now than ever that free speech be protected.

[03:34:07.389 --> 03:34:10.569]  Central Time. I will be hosting the Alex Jones Show from 4 to 8 p.m.
[03:34:10.829 --> 03:34:12.250]  tomorrow evening. Stay tuned.
[03:34:12.450 --> 03:34:19.489]  Watch this report from Alex Jones and fight the good fight for America and humanity at thealexjonesstore.com and realalexjones.com.
[03:34:19.649 --> 03:34:31.379]  Thank you and good luck. Six years ago, the deep state came for Infowars and almost no one spoke up or took action.
[03:34:32.040 --> 03:34:33.860]  I warned you then that you were next.
[03:34:34.459 --> 03:34:37.440]  Now the globalists have launched a new, more vicious attack.
[03:34:37.940 --> 03:34:43.719]  The precedent is being set right now to literally steal my identity and shut down Infowars.
[03:34:44.059 --> 03:34:46.340]  Will the public rally to my support this time?
[03:34:46.500 --> 03:34:51.020]  Or sit back and be targeted themselves and picked off one by one?
[03:34:54.559 --> 03:35:01.860]  The globalist deep state just took their war on free speech and our very identities and our very freedoms to the next level.
[03:35:02.200 --> 03:35:15.500]  They have now introduced a lawsuit against me where they literally claim they own my name, my social media, and me personally in violation of the 13th Amendment that we fought the Civil War over.
[03:35:15.700 --> 03:35:20.299]  They're actually saying I'm an indentured servant, that I am a slave.
[03:35:20.860 --> 03:35:23.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm always the canary in the coal mine.
[03:35:23.379 --> 03:35:24.700]  I am the test case.
[03:35:24.860 --> 03:35:27.200]  And when they get through me, they're coming after you.
[03:35:33.659 --> 03:35:43.440]  The biggest attack yet, not just on the First Amendment, but on the 13th Amendment in modern history is now taking place.
[03:35:44.459 --> 03:35:50.280]  Now, as you know, InfoWars has been under major lawfare, Democrat Party, deep state attack for at least seven years.
[03:35:50.639 --> 03:35:53.780]  The only other person that's been more demonized in attack is President Trump.
[03:35:54.260 --> 03:35:56.100]  And of course, now they're going after Elon Musk.
[03:35:56.260 --> 03:36:00.420]  But in the long run, they have been after me massively.
[03:36:00.639 --> 03:36:07.440]  They see me as a populist leader that has been absolutely critical in exposing their agenda, and they want me off the air.
[03:36:09.149 --> 03:36:11.129]  InfoWars is up for sale November 13th.
[03:36:11.530 --> 03:36:14.510]  If patriots are unable to buy it, it will be shut down.
[03:36:15.030 --> 03:36:17.870]  Soros funded group Media Matters says they're going to try to buy it.
[03:36:17.989 --> 03:36:19.270]  But that's a separate issue.
[03:36:19.430 --> 03:36:20.829]  That already broke the last few weeks.
[03:36:21.270 --> 03:36:27.270]  What I'm about to talk about Just happened last night and again is unprecedented.
[03:36:27.889 --> 03:36:31.010]  And this affects Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson.
[03:36:31.309 --> 03:36:32.950]  It affects Elon Musk.
[03:36:33.049 --> 03:36:34.389]  It affects President Trump.
[03:36:34.549 --> 03:36:35.670]  It affects you.
[03:36:35.750 --> 03:37:06.010]  It affects all populists or conservatives or people that just want to stop World War III. The Democrat Party law firm run by Senator Blumenthal up in Connecticut has openly come out and filed in Travis County in the Democrat-controlled It's just as bad as New York or DC with the lawfare to appoint a receiver over me that literally controls everything I do,
[03:37:06.370 --> 03:37:10.850]  controls my bank account, literally makes me property of these people.
[03:37:11.389 --> 03:37:15.209]  Now, under the 13th Amendment we'll put on screen, you're not supposed to be able to do this.
[03:37:15.450 --> 03:37:18.049]  Plus, I'm still in bankruptcy court.
[03:37:18.920 --> 03:37:27.899]  And the Texas Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court, the Fifth Circuit, over and over again have ruled against these receivers and said it violates the 13th Amendment.
[03:37:28.159 --> 03:37:35.639]  But worse than that, Connecticut and Texas law say, while the fake billion and a half dollar judgments are on appeal...
[03:37:39.700 --> 03:37:42.020]  We're good to go.
[03:37:42.719 --> 03:37:46.479]  We're good to go.
[03:38:06.610 --> 03:38:12.729]  To stay on the air under the law with these giant judgments that never go away because they didn't want to settle.
[03:38:12.930 --> 03:38:14.670]  They said it wasn't about money. They want me off the air.
[03:38:14.889 --> 03:38:20.030]  They said it on national TV. The Democrat lawyers said it on the courthouse steps in Texas and Connecticut.
[03:38:20.389 --> 03:38:21.530]  They want me off air.
[03:38:21.780 --> 03:38:26.079]  Take Alex Jones' platform that he talks about away.
[03:38:26.700 --> 03:38:30.100]  I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild.
[03:38:30.420 --> 03:38:36.819]  There's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of Infowars and the bankruptcy estate.
[03:38:37.219 --> 03:38:40.579]  And over the course of that process, that could get very, very dangerous for Mr.
[03:38:40.760 --> 03:38:46.219]  Jones. I hope that we never see someone like him again.
[03:38:47.159 --> 03:38:57.459]  And if you're out there right now, and you're one of Alex Jones' audience members, and you're considering giving him money, I just want you to know that based on the jury's verdict today, it's not a very good bet.
[03:38:58.180 --> 03:39:08.260]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he can't do it again.
[03:39:08.860 --> 03:39:12.680]  So they wanna chase me, they wanna run me to ground, they wanna try to torture me.
[03:39:13.110 --> 03:39:14.129]  I can handle all that.
[03:39:14.229 --> 03:39:16.370]  I'm a big boy. I'm taking on the deep state.
[03:39:16.489 --> 03:39:17.649]  I expect this stuff to happen.
[03:39:17.989 --> 03:39:20.889]  But what I do need to do is stay on air.
[03:39:21.569 --> 03:39:27.489]  And so regardless of what happens to Infowars, I need legal defense to be able to block what they're doing.
[03:39:28.120 --> 03:39:32.840]  And to be able to continue on with the new broadcast where I work for someone else.
[03:39:32.940 --> 03:39:35.280]  Because that's what you do. I can't own companies.
[03:39:35.500 --> 03:39:36.739]  I can't be the boss.
[03:39:36.920 --> 03:39:39.120]  But I can be the boss of what I talk about on air.
[03:39:39.280 --> 03:39:46.979]  So as long as I work for other companies or a company that doesn't violate my speech, I'll be totally happy to stay on the air that way.
[03:39:47.059 --> 03:39:52.200]  But in the interim, I've got to fight in the federal and state court where they're not just saying they own me.
[03:39:52.440 --> 03:39:57.780]  They've also filed in federal court and also in the state court saying they own the name Alex Jones.
[03:39:58.100 --> 03:40:05.420]  And that they own real Alex Jones on X. Now, the courts have all said you can't do things like that, but they're trying it.
[03:40:05.579 --> 03:40:12.500]  And if I don't aggressively battle them in the state and federal court, they will get a win if I don't challenge it.
[03:40:12.620 --> 03:40:15.360]  And then they'll be able to use that tactic on you as well.
[03:40:15.620 --> 03:40:22.799]  So I'm asking everyone to research the case, to read about the filings below, to look at the news articles I'm putting up on screen.
[03:40:22.940 --> 03:40:25.860]  I know it sounds crazy to own my name and own my social media.
[03:40:26.569 --> 03:40:43.909]  That's never been done before, but they are trying it, and I'm asking you to go to therealalexjones.com, and that takes you right to the great folks, the Patriot crowdsourcing site, GiveSinGo, where you can donate $10, $100, $1,000 in this critical fight.
[03:40:44.170 --> 03:40:45.329]  The globalists hate my broadcast.
[03:40:46.049 --> 03:40:47.549]  They're obsessed with taking it off the air.
[03:40:48.170 --> 03:40:49.610]  They wanna set that precedent.
[03:40:49.989 --> 03:41:12.670]  And when you support me staying on the air in the face of this tyranny, it is so important to the future of America and of the entire world as we expose the human trafficking, as all the CIA We're good to go.
[03:41:21.209 --> 03:41:27.649]  In my 30-plus years on air, this is the most important time ever because now InfoWars has so much credibility.
[03:41:27.829 --> 03:41:29.989]  People know we are tomorrow's news today.
[03:41:30.149 --> 03:41:40.950]  Well, even if they take InfoWars, I'm the guy that created InfoWars, and that's why they, again, want to come in and own my name and come in and say that they own my likeness and own me.
[03:41:41.110 --> 03:41:47.569]  I'm not like Prince, who signed a 360 record deal with a record company to own his likeness and his name and all of his music.
[03:41:50.610 --> 03:41:56.969]  We're good to go.
[03:41:56.969 --> 03:42:00.129]  We're good to go.
[03:42:00.610 --> 03:42:04.149]  We're good to go.
[03:42:06.709 --> 03:42:14.309]  Where it'll go as far in the fight against tyrants as Gibson Go and my Keep Alex Jones Broadcast on the Air page.
[03:42:14.889 --> 03:42:23.409]  Separately, if you want to get great t-shirts and ball caps that spread the word and expose the globalists, Then you go to thealexjonesstore.com, and that's my sponsor.
[03:42:23.569 --> 03:42:25.309]  It's gonna help with the fight as well.
[03:42:25.469 --> 03:42:29.530]  And then no matter what happens to InfoWars, I intend, again, to continue on.
[03:42:29.670 --> 03:42:40.930]  I intend to try to bring as much of the crew as I can with me, and it's gonna be those sponsors that are critical in that fight, thealexjonesstore.com, drjonesnaturals.com for great supplements and more.
[03:42:41.090 --> 03:42:43.129]  So again, we hope to get a good buyer for InfoWars.
[03:42:43.290 --> 03:42:48.510]  We hope to stay on air, but regardless of what happens there, they're moving in on the 17th of October.
[03:42:49.399 --> 03:42:58.120]  In Texas, in Travis County, in front of these leftist judges in an attempt to literally come in and say a receiver owns me and everything I do.
[03:42:58.319 --> 03:43:00.920]  Let me read to you. The 13th Amendment.
[03:43:04.760 --> 03:43:14.139]  And this is slavery.
[03:43:14.440 --> 03:43:16.319]  It violates the 13th Amendment.
[03:43:16.559 --> 03:43:17.920]  And I will never be silenced.
[03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:19.200]  I will never be intimidated.
[03:43:19.520 --> 03:43:21.360]  I will never shut up.
[03:43:21.459 --> 03:43:26.260]  But this is the next level of censorship and control is them saying they own my name.
[03:43:26.969 --> 03:43:33.170]  They own my social media that is my likeness, and they own me and my paycheck personally.
[03:43:33.389 --> 03:43:34.469]  You can't do that.
[03:43:34.670 --> 03:43:41.370]  You can try to grab money out of somebody's account, but you can't stop their employers from giving you the paycheck.
[03:43:41.709 --> 03:43:45.430]  They have to try to get that from you with collection agencies and things.
[03:43:45.920 --> 03:43:50.440]  So they are really trying to get rid of the bankruptcy laws and protections in this country.
[03:43:50.680 --> 03:43:54.180]  The Democrats are literally coming for everybody.
[03:43:54.379 --> 03:44:05.319]  So that's why I'm asking you respectfully and all the other talk show hosts and others that are gonna be the next targets to stand with me and to support InfoWars and to support myself so that I can continue to fight.
[03:44:05.479 --> 03:44:06.979]  I just wanna stay in the fight.
[03:44:07.579 --> 03:44:08.899]  I just want to win this thing.
[03:44:08.959 --> 03:44:10.760]  I just want to back President Trump.
[03:44:10.940 --> 03:44:12.600]  I don't ever want to give up.
[03:44:12.719 --> 03:44:14.840]  So please, keep me in the fight.
[03:44:15.059 --> 03:44:17.620]  Go to realalexjones.com.
[03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:22.540]  Go to thealexjonesstore.com and support this fight because we are right at the tip of the spear.
[03:44:22.799 --> 03:44:29.959]  We've only been successful due to your support, and I humbly ask your future support, and I humbly thank you for everything you've done.
[03:44:30.239 --> 03:44:32.639]  God bless. Now, everything is in your court.
[03:44:32.819 --> 03:44:33.879]  I am in your hands.
[03:44:34.700 --> 03:44:37.879]  And you are in my hands because my fate will end up being your fate.
[03:44:38.180 --> 03:44:41.479]  Please stand with me at this critical time in the battle for our republic.
[03:44:42.139 --> 03:44:43.979]  Hi, I'm Kamala Harris.
[03:44:44.500 --> 03:44:53.459]  When I'm elected president, platforms that promote free speech, truth, and resilience to the New World Order, like TheAlexJonesStore.com, will be banned.
[03:44:53.739 --> 03:44:58.680]  Sites that profit off dangerous truths are a threat to our democracy.
[03:44:59.059 --> 03:45:07.840]  Shirts sold at TheAlexJonesStore.com, like the InfoWars limited edition fundraiser t-shirt, will no longer be tolerated.
[03:45:08.059 --> 03:45:12.309]  And let's be clear. If you're caught wearing one of these shirts, you will face arrest.
[03:45:12.969 --> 03:45:24.209]  Whether it's the Alex Jones for President 2028 shirt or any other merchandise pushing harmful messages of patriotism, family, faith and freedom, this kind of propaganda has no place in our future.
[03:45:24.629 --> 03:45:28.389]  We will create a future where safety, censorship and tyranny prevail.
[03:45:28.799 --> 03:45:34.879]  Don't go to thealexjonesstore.com to purchase products that keep Alex Jones on the air.
[03:45:35.139 --> 03:45:37.780]  Don't wear the shirts or support humanity.
[03:45:38.000 --> 03:45:41.700]  If you do, you'll be the first in line for my depopulation agenda.
[03:45:42.420 --> 03:45:46.040]  Now obviously that is AI satire of Kamala Harris.
[03:45:46.379 --> 03:45:47.559]  That's not really her.
[03:45:47.780 --> 03:45:54.340]  But if you look at her policies and what she supported and what big tech and the Democrats won and what Hillary Clinton has said.
[03:45:54.459 --> 03:46:00.159]  There are Americans who are engaged in this kind of propaganda.
[03:46:00.440 --> 03:46:08.659]  They are directly speaking to millions and millions of people without any level of oversight or regulation.
[03:46:09.149 --> 03:46:17.510]  Whether they should be civilly or even in some cases criminally charged is something that would be a better deterrence.
[03:46:17.649 --> 03:46:20.010]  There's no guarantee to free speech on misinformation.
[03:46:20.489 --> 03:46:23.889]  They indeed do want to put people in jail for their free speech.
[03:46:24.030 --> 03:46:32.110]  And the Justice Department that she's controlled by, that's hijacked this country, has been running the whole operation trying to shut down Infowars.
[03:46:32.290 --> 03:46:35.790]  And on November 13th, it goes up for auction.
[03:46:36.129 --> 03:46:38.750]  And the Democrats have said, they never wanted money from me.
[03:46:38.829 --> 03:46:39.909]  They wanted me silenced.
[03:46:40.149 --> 03:46:42.489]  That was always their goal.
[03:46:42.670 --> 03:46:47.010]  Take Alex Jones' platform that he talks about away.
[03:46:47.770 --> 03:46:51.049]  I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild.
[03:46:51.409 --> 03:46:57.750]  There's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the courts of Infowars and the bankruptcy estate.
[03:46:58.129 --> 03:47:01.510]  And over the course of that process, that could get very, very dangerous for Mr.
[03:47:01.690 --> 03:47:07.219]  Jones. I hope that we never see someone like him again.
[03:47:08.260 --> 03:47:18.399]  And if you're out there right now and you're one of Alex Jones' audience members and you're considering giving him money, I just want you to know that based on the jury's verdict today, it's not a very good bet.
[03:47:19.120 --> 03:47:29.139]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he can't do it again.
[03:47:30.020 --> 03:47:38.860]  They're scared of satire because real satire, powerful satire, takes a truth and then basically presents it to show how absurd it is.
[03:47:39.219 --> 03:47:52.469]  So I'm asking all of you for your support to fund the AlexJonesStore.com and get these great t-shirts and ball caps so one way or another, My broadcast continues on regardless of what happens.
[03:47:52.649 --> 03:48:02.010]  We may be able to get some patriots to outbid Soros and Media Matters for Infowars and this operation, but regardless, myself and the crew want to come roaring back.
[03:48:02.170 --> 03:48:05.250]  So support our sponsor, thealexjonesstore.com.
[03:48:05.409 --> 03:48:06.549]  Get these amazing shirts.
[03:48:06.889 --> 03:48:08.489]  That's how you keep us on air.
[03:48:09.079 --> 03:48:17.360]  And these shirts are so timely, launching the First Amendment and Second Amendment Defense League, standing up for the right of free speech and self-defense.
[03:48:17.700 --> 03:48:23.299]  This shirt and so many other amazing shirts, now available exclusively at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[03:48:23.520 --> 03:48:24.579]  This is serious.
[03:48:24.959 --> 03:48:26.760]  This affects the entire country and the world.
[03:48:26.940 --> 03:48:30.219]  They're trying to get through me, as Trump says, to get to you.
[03:48:30.399 --> 03:48:31.520]  So please stand with us.
[03:48:31.719 --> 03:48:32.979]  I thank you all for your support.
[03:48:33.180 --> 03:48:37.200]  Plus, these are amazing shirts at TheAlexJonesStore.com.
[03:48:37.420 --> 03:48:38.180]  Please take action.
