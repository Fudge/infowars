[00:00:11.323 --> 00:00:14.366]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.407 --> 00:01:05.383]  When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19 hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.
[00:01:06.844 --> 00:01:10.147]  They did not know if they would survive the hour.
[00:01:11.568 --> 00:01:12.489]  They did not know
[00:01:13.547 --> 00:01:14.548]  If they would grow old.
[00:01:15.748 --> 00:01:19.670]  But they knew that America had to prevail.
[00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:27.134]  Their cause was this nation and generations yet unborn.
[00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.516]  Why did they do it?
[00:01:31.997 --> 00:01:33.237]  They did it for America.
[00:01:33.757 --> 00:01:34.898]  They did it for us.
[00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:41.982]  Everything that has come since our triumph
[00:01:42.987 --> 00:01:43.887]  Over communism.
[00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:48.289]  Our giant leaps of science and discovery.
[00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.650]  Our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice.
[00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:03.233]  All of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.
[00:02:05.454 --> 00:02:07.254]  Think of this Capitol.
[00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:10.155]  Think of this very chamber.
[00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:29.178]  We're lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, and defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, and to face down evil empires.
[00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:38.542]  Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic.
[00:02:40.464 --> 00:03:00.736]  You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii, from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona, from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California.
[00:03:02.818 --> 00:03:09.782]  Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history.
[00:03:11.556 --> 00:03:14.818]  What will we do with this moment?
[00:03:16.178 --> 00:03:18.279]  How will we be remembered?
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:27.364]  I ask the men and women of this Congress, look at the opportunities before us.
[00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:33.387]  Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead.
[00:03:35.108 --> 00:03:38.650]  Our most exciting journeys still await.
[00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:43.852]  Our biggest victories are still to come.
[00:03:45.533 --> 00:03:49.054]  We have not yet begun to dream.
[00:03:50.274 --> 00:03:59.077]  We must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether we dare to transcend them.
[00:04:00.597 --> 00:04:02.938]  We must choose whether we squander
[00:04:04.384 --> 00:04:10.528]  Our great inheritance, or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans.
[00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:13.010]  We do the incredible.
[00:04:14.391 --> 00:04:15.992]  We defy the impossible.
[00:04:17.573 --> 00:04:19.154]  We conquer the unknown.
[00:04:20.595 --> 00:04:27.200]  This is the time to reignite the American imagination.
[00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:32.124]  This is the time to search for the tallest summit
[00:04:33.078 --> 00:04:36.620]  And set our sights on the brightest star.
[00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:48.727]  This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.
[00:04:50.448 --> 00:04:52.910]  This is our future, our fate.
[00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.010]  Very powerful.
[00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.391]  And our choice to make.
[00:04:55.811 --> 00:05:01.174]  We'll play a lot more of this today on this Wednesday, February 6, 2019 Global Transmission.
[00:05:01.555 --> 00:05:02.155]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:04.753 --> 00:05:17.060]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[00:05:18.181 --> 00:05:29.247]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:32.201]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[00:05:32.461 --> 00:05:35.125]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[00:05:36.496 --> 00:05:40.279]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:44.783]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[00:05:45.103 --> 00:05:47.124]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[00:05:47.365 --> 00:05:48.866]  This country is in a war!
[00:05:49.706 --> 00:05:59.734]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[00:06:00.395 --> 00:06:03.978]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:20.655]  InfoWars.
[00:06:20.975 --> 00:06:22.596]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:26.937]  It's Wednesday, February 6, 2019.
[00:06:53.226 --> 00:07:02.148]  And I am very, very reflective this morning, this afternoon, about what we're facing.
[00:07:04.628 --> 00:07:15.910]  And the fact that everybody at a core deep down level who's got any connection to God or any connection to reality understands that we are facing a demonic invasion.
[00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.031]  Call it demonic, call it space aliens, call it whatever you want.
[00:07:21.078 --> 00:07:45.467]  There are fingerprints, there are desires, there are hungers that aren't human, that are manifesting themselves throughout civilization, and that are attempting to basically take over our world and destroy our children, our health, our psyches, our very souls.
[00:07:45.767 --> 00:07:46.848]  Call it what you want.
[00:07:48.592 --> 00:07:53.797]  But when you study the globalists and you study what they're really into, they're all heavily into the occult.
[00:07:54.718 --> 00:08:03.606]  And they believe that entities from another dimension are giving them divine power.
[00:08:03.806 --> 00:08:05.468]  That's the new world order religion.
[00:08:05.988 --> 00:08:08.070]  And you're like, well, that's exactly what the Bible says.
[00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:13.215]  And everything in the Bible and Revelation is now unfolding.
[00:08:15.643 --> 00:08:23.805]  And Revelation says in the last days, there will literally be demons running around in people possessed in mass.
[00:08:25.986 --> 00:08:29.146]  And I come in here and I look at the news and I'm not digging for stuff like this.
[00:08:30.227 --> 00:08:30.887]  And it's incredible.
[00:08:30.967 --> 00:08:33.708]  And I see it on the street in Austin.
[00:08:34.088 --> 00:08:42.930]  And I hear about it from friends and family in other cities and other areas where there is a hunger of the left.
[00:08:43.817 --> 00:08:44.578]  The left-hand path.
[00:08:44.618 --> 00:08:46.299]  That's, that's, that's Satanism.
[00:08:47.019 --> 00:08:47.980]  They're not liberals.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:48.800]  They're the left.
[00:08:49.301 --> 00:08:50.221]  They're the Satan Party.
[00:08:53.083 --> 00:08:57.767]  And now, all over national news, they have the Church of Satan, Temple of Satan, all these groups ongoing.
[00:08:58.207 --> 00:09:00.629]  We fear the Christians, and they have to be dealt with.
[00:09:01.409 --> 00:09:02.550]  And they have to be banned.
[00:09:04.692 --> 00:09:06.533]  And the news is like, thank you, Church of Satan.
[00:09:08.134 --> 00:09:08.634]  You're right.
[00:09:10.696 --> 00:09:12.257]  Thank you for protecting the children.
[00:09:14.332 --> 00:09:18.314]  And then their statue that they put up in public is Bath-O-Met.
[00:09:20.855 --> 00:09:23.156]  With the two children looking up to Bath-O-Met.
[00:09:23.377 --> 00:09:24.537]  Oh, Bath-O-Met.
[00:09:26.478 --> 00:09:31.300]  Think about how Trump, in last night's speech, I want to play this over and over again.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.282]  Got a big list here, but can you guys queue it up?
[00:09:34.322 --> 00:09:37.163]  We talked about a doctor executing a baby.
[00:09:39.124 --> 00:09:42.146]  And how the blackface and all that's bad enough,
[00:09:43.732 --> 00:09:47.053]  But what about killing babies after they're born?
[00:09:47.613 --> 00:09:50.214]  And Trump says, why do we even need a law?
[00:09:50.654 --> 00:09:51.494]  That's already illegal.
[00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:56.635]  And that's the point, is it's the way they're saying the government shouldn't be involved.
[00:09:57.875 --> 00:10:01.176]  We're going to let the doctors decide, the medical facilities.
[00:10:01.456 --> 00:10:02.577]  It's all about organs.
[00:10:03.137 --> 00:10:05.957]  So that's the next piece, is the organs.
[00:10:06.017 --> 00:10:08.298]  And he's an organ harvesting doctor.
[00:10:09.505 --> 00:10:14.147]  I knew he was a pediatrician and a surgeon on children, but I looked deeper.
[00:10:14.508 --> 00:10:16.629]  He's involved in the organ racket.
[00:10:17.109 --> 00:10:17.589]  I knew it!
[00:10:20.691 --> 00:10:24.593]  And when Trump said that, I was fascinated this morning.
[00:10:24.633 --> 00:10:26.153]  I spent like an hour looking for different angles.
[00:10:26.173 --> 00:10:28.114]  C-SPAN, ABC, they're all different.
[00:10:32.857 --> 00:10:39.120]  The Democrats were shaking their heads and angry with him when he said you shouldn't kill a baby after it's born.
[00:10:40.316 --> 00:10:41.297]  You shouldn't execute it.
[00:10:41.317 --> 00:10:42.237]  He used the proper term.
[00:10:42.257 --> 00:10:43.198]  The President did.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.961]  So see, that's the thing here.
[00:10:51.744 --> 00:10:56.508]  Is that then Trump starts talking about
[00:10:57.432 --> 00:11:06.375]  All the women they've saved from sex slavery, and all the children, and the massive arrests being weighed up, and the convictions, and they're all shaking their heads again, and angry.
[00:11:07.475 --> 00:11:08.516]  Because let me tell you something, folks.
[00:11:08.596 --> 00:11:10.936]  I live in Texas, where the Democrats have almost taken over.
[00:11:10.956 --> 00:11:14.698]  It's the average Texas walking around going, you'll never get control of Texas.
[00:11:14.978 --> 00:11:15.258]  Bull!
[00:11:15.498 --> 00:11:17.279]  They'll get control, just like California.
[00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:18.699]  You better wake up.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:21.700]  We're two minutes to midnight here.
[00:11:25.831 --> 00:11:32.515]  And I've got all these clips of Democrats angry and shaking their head and staring at Trump with hate.
[00:11:33.476 --> 00:11:35.457]  Because, folks, let me explain something to you.
[00:11:37.338 --> 00:11:45.324]  Beto O'Rourke brags that we're getting thousands in from caravans a day, while on national news he says there's no such thing as a caravan.
[00:11:45.544 --> 00:11:53.409]  This is military operations we're up against, where you lie to your enemy, the people, you tell your own operatives, we're getting 2,000 a day in just in my sector.
[00:11:54.465 --> 00:11:55.927]  This is an army of evil.
[00:11:59.671 --> 00:12:02.554]  And the Democrats skim money off the illegal aliens.
[00:12:02.574 --> 00:12:03.635]  They're the permanent underclass.
[00:12:04.556 --> 00:12:15.528]  They've caught them all over Texas with city council members, families running dungeons with chained up people inside of them because they didn't pay all the money they were supposed to to get smuggled up here.
[00:12:18.186 --> 00:12:19.828]  These are hardcore criminals.
[00:12:20.809 --> 00:12:35.465]  So when you sit there and you see Cortez and all these people pissed, shaking their heads, and angry, and Kamala Harris shakes her head at Trump, talking about combating cartels and human traffickers, that's because this is a mafia, folks!
[00:12:35.865 --> 00:12:37.227]  America's got cancer!
[00:12:37.847 --> 00:12:39.009]  These people are cancer!
[00:12:41.476 --> 00:12:43.438]  These are dirtbag crooks, man.
[00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:44.959]  They run rackets.
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.923]  MS-13, Mexican Mafia, is their enforcement arm.
[00:12:49.744 --> 00:12:53.028]  Democrats pull hits all the time in major cities.
[00:12:53.268 --> 00:12:54.629]  They kill people!
[00:12:56.311 --> 00:12:59.154]  What, you just think gangsters are only Italian?
[00:13:08.612 --> 00:13:15.557]  The Italian Mafia got pushed out from its quasi-dominant path in the 50s because they wouldn't be involved in pedophilia.
[00:13:16.257 --> 00:13:18.499]  That's why the Italian Mafia got minimized.
[00:13:21.161 --> 00:13:25.684]  The real Mafia, ladies and gentlemen, is the scum you see on those dioceses.
[00:13:30.307 --> 00:13:33.950]  And the dirtier Italian Mafia, that's what Pelosi comes from, joined.
[00:13:35.251 --> 00:13:36.512]  Joined with evil.
[00:13:37.674 --> 00:13:39.374]  That's who these people are.
[00:13:39.795 --> 00:13:49.017]  And so, Gabb McGinnis has now discovered that in the Canadian Trans Kids program, they're teaching the kids about serial killers and how cool they are.
[00:13:50.277 --> 00:13:51.958]  You're like, oh, that's just one more piece.
[00:13:52.018 --> 00:13:54.659]  Like, The Amazing Desmond.
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.360]  The Amazing Desmond.
[00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:03.370]  Desmond is amazing.
[00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:08.314]  Talking about taking ketamine and drugs and sex parties and he dances on stage for men.
[00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:12.018]  And it's all in your face.
[00:14:15.101 --> 00:14:15.541]  You understand?
[00:14:17.583 --> 00:14:18.083]  That's what it is.
[00:14:18.123 --> 00:14:20.826]  When you sign on to Hollywood, you sign on to any of it.
[00:14:24.429 --> 00:14:26.010]  That's who you're with now.
[00:14:27.672 --> 00:14:28.773]  So let's play the president.
[00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:33.770]  Standing up against killing babies after they're born.
[00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:34.270]  Wow.
[00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.690]  And we can't even get everybody to agree to that.
[00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.150]  Here it is.
[00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:50.653]  There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days.
[00:14:52.873 --> 00:14:55.774]  Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight
[00:14:56.812 --> 00:15:05.836]  Upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments from birth.
[00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:14.660]  These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:24.324]  And then we had the case of the governor of Virginia, where he stated he would execute a baby after birth.
[00:15:25.865 --> 00:15:41.218]  To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb.
[00:15:50.967 --> 00:15:53.289]  Yeah, we're facing devil worshippers.
[00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.571]  And these entities want children.
[00:15:57.912 --> 00:15:58.172]  Period.
[00:15:59.172 --> 00:15:59.793]  That's what this is.
[00:16:00.113 --> 00:16:02.955]  They're harvesting our children in front of us.

[00:19:09.243 --> 00:19:11.064]  When we exercise our rights.
[00:19:14.006 --> 00:19:16.088]  When we soar to our greatest heights.
[00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:23.273]  When we mourn and pray.
[00:19:23.293 --> 00:19:24.934]  When our neighbors are at risk.
[00:19:27.016 --> 00:19:30.878]  When our nation is threatened.
[00:19:30.898 --> 00:19:32.920]  There's someone to gather the facts.
[00:19:35.137 --> 00:19:36.118]  To bring you the story.
[00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:39.880]  No matter the cost.
[00:19:42.401 --> 00:19:45.803]  This is why so many people can't stand the mainstream media.
[00:19:46.263 --> 00:19:48.004]  Because knowing empowers us.
[00:19:49.745 --> 00:19:51.786]  Knowing helps us decide.
[00:19:52.986 --> 00:19:55.268]  Knowing keeps us free.
[00:20:07.054 --> 00:20:09.875]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:10.655 --> 00:20:35.564]  From the front line.
[00:20:37.354 --> 00:20:53.178]  You know, I missed Joe Rogan's phone call last night.
[00:20:55.399 --> 00:20:56.179]  Had my phone off.
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.701]  But I really am so disgusted, I don't know if I would have taken the call if I knew he called.
[00:21:08.715 --> 00:21:13.498]  Nevertheless, Joe will be on with us at the bottom of the next hour live.
[00:21:13.858 --> 00:21:14.218]  Joe Rogan.
[00:21:15.759 --> 00:21:17.700]  So I guess we'll take his call live here on air.
[00:21:18.721 --> 00:21:22.663]  Unlike the fact that he never lets me defend myself on his podcast.
[00:21:23.244 --> 00:21:25.885]  So Joe Rogan will be on, bottom of the next hour.
[00:21:30.028 --> 00:21:32.849]  And of course, satire starts with an S. I'll leave it at that.
[00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.531]  Now, let's get serious.
[00:21:40.456 --> 00:21:41.637]  I am not just sure.
[00:21:42.297 --> 00:21:57.506]  I am absolutely, 100% dead accurate on everything the Bible said is true, and it's all right in front of us, and it's crazy.
[00:21:57.586 --> 00:22:00.508]  This is a freaking space invasion, people.
[00:22:01.429 --> 00:22:02.790]  We're on a planet out in space.
[00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.871]  The globalists are a bunch of devil worshippers.
[00:22:04.911 --> 00:22:06.352]  They want our children's essence.
[00:22:08.237 --> 00:22:10.498]  And they want our souls, they want our minds.
[00:22:12.639 --> 00:22:18.502]  And if you just look at the genetic engineering and everything going on, we're in the middle of a takeover, of a revolution.
[00:22:19.763 --> 00:22:26.506]  And the people involved in it are unified, and focused, and organized, and know exactly what they're doing.
[00:22:27.266 --> 00:22:32.629]  It's formulaic, it's unity of purpose, it's strategic, and it's directed.
[00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:37.211]  And I knew God was real, and I knew all this was real before.
[00:22:38.268 --> 00:22:42.511]  Because of experiences and sixth sense and things I grew up seeing and all of it.
[00:22:43.532 --> 00:23:01.586]  But when I went to a city fully under alien control, like San Francisco or Seattle, that's a couple of their main bases, as you know, their main breakthrough points, they breached and they've got pretty much the whole city under their control.
[00:23:02.226 --> 00:23:07.611]  Demons, whatever it is, is that Zimmerman is not a cowardly guy.
[00:23:08.558 --> 00:23:11.859]  But he stopped wanting to go outside with me after about two days.
[00:23:11.879 --> 00:23:12.839]  We were there for six days.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.780]  In Seattle particularly, because he saw it.
[00:23:18.141 --> 00:23:26.103]  He saw it where we would round one corner and it was like Agent Smith in the Matrix.
[00:23:26.323 --> 00:23:29.064]  The elites telling you all this would just jump into person after person.
[00:23:29.724 --> 00:23:34.246]  And it was like people were saying incredibly evil, horrible things.
[00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:41.037]  To me, as I would round a corner, the next person would finish the sentence and do it in a demonic voice.
[00:23:42.098 --> 00:23:43.339]  We've played a lot of these videos.
[00:23:44.479 --> 00:23:54.626]  And people will see at the State House where they're trying to pass a pro-life deal and women just chain reactions start going, hail Satan, I want babies, I want blood, hail Satan, hail Satan.
[00:23:55.107 --> 00:24:00.911]  Women in business suits just, it wasn't even organized, they all just, like the spirit of Satan just came down upon them.
[00:24:02.298 --> 00:24:08.841]  Or you go to a pro-life demonstration, and the Antifa shows up, and they've got devil tattoos, they're saying, I killed my kid, I love Satan!
[00:24:09.621 --> 00:24:12.103]  And it's getting worse, it's like all over.
[00:24:12.503 --> 00:24:18.726]  Whether you believe demons are real or whatever this is, or it's like some avatar jacking into them, these people are into this.
[00:24:19.366 --> 00:24:20.847]  This is happening everywhere.
[00:24:21.367 --> 00:24:22.328]  This is who they are.
[00:24:22.588 --> 00:24:31.372]  And they know that we have morals and moral superiority in the moral high ground, so they're always telling us that we're bad and we're scum and we're stupid,
[00:24:32.861 --> 00:24:36.923]  And that we morally are doing bad things because they know that's how they get to us.
[00:24:37.483 --> 00:24:39.944]  They have no morals except whatever they want to do.
[00:24:39.964 --> 00:24:47.607]  In fact, we'll play an intro from the show a few years ago, just a few clips of the devil worshipping.
[00:24:49.308 --> 00:25:02.434]  But the reason I say that is when you understand that what we're facing are a bunch of people that aren't playing like they're vampires.
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.460]  Folks, they've got big circles around their eyes.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.341]  They have got zombie looks in their face.
[00:25:08.381 --> 00:25:09.221]  They're drooling.
[00:25:10.981 --> 00:25:13.522]  You're literally battling the forces of hell.
[00:25:17.722 --> 00:25:18.122]  It's real.
[00:25:19.843 --> 00:25:20.203]  It's real.
[00:25:22.063 --> 00:25:26.844]  And... That's why every culture's been obsessed with it.
[00:25:27.684 --> 00:25:28.584]  And everyone knows it.
[00:25:30.005 --> 00:25:31.665]  And you've got a bunch of weak people
[00:25:32.895 --> 00:25:35.577]  That think evil is powerful, so they go join with it.
[00:25:35.637 --> 00:25:37.258]  Kind of like mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:47.705]  So I want to open the phones up about this issue, and also want to open the phones up about the State of the Union, what you thought the best parts of it were, the best moments, and the worst moments.
[00:25:48.366 --> 00:25:49.066]  Those three topics.
[00:25:50.247 --> 00:25:53.510]  Revelation is now becoming manifest.
[00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:55.511]  Mark of the Beast, world government.
[00:25:55.891 --> 00:25:56.672]  Jack Dorsey.
[00:25:57.392 --> 00:25:58.133]  I just tune in.
[00:26:00.936 --> 00:26:11.245]  To Joe Rogan, and he's pushing a new global one-world government currency run by Jack Dorsey and Twitter, moderated by all their people like they did with the Bitcoin wars.
[00:26:11.705 --> 00:26:12.606]  All that censorship.
[00:26:12.766 --> 00:26:15.848]  By the way, I forgot to tell you guys, just type in Joe Rogan Bitcoin.
[00:26:16.749 --> 00:26:20.612]  There's a bunch of big articles by folks pointing out that it's insider trading, just like I told you.
[00:26:21.813 --> 00:26:22.954]  And very unethical.
[00:26:23.615 --> 00:26:27.258]  And one of them is the dark side of Joe Rogan and Bitcoin.
[00:26:30.691 --> 00:26:31.972]  I think it's from Hack.com.
[00:26:32.152 --> 00:26:33.493]  That's the article on him.
[00:26:33.553 --> 00:26:34.013]  There it is.
[00:26:34.033 --> 00:26:40.357]  The Dark Side of Jack Dorsey's Bitcoin Push on Joe Rogan.
[00:26:41.137 --> 00:26:44.639]  And of course, Joe didn't say on the show that it was a sponsor who made it clear.
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.161]  He talked about how great it was because it helped somebody's charity.
[00:26:48.459 --> 00:26:50.220]  So it's all esoteric to figure it out.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.081]  The SEC, don't worry.
[00:26:52.681 --> 00:27:00.585]  Dorsey dropped the cards that, hey, I meet with the SEC, they're helping me, which means he's giving them jobs and revolving doors and he's covered.
[00:27:01.025 --> 00:27:03.347]  He's protected.
[00:27:03.787 --> 00:27:06.128]  He's part of the missionarate protectorate.
[00:27:08.288 --> 00:27:09.149]  He's in the priesthood.
[00:27:09.469 --> 00:27:10.510]  He's a made man.
[00:27:11.191 --> 00:27:12.031]  He can do whatever he wants.
[00:27:12.051 --> 00:27:12.852]  So don't worry, Joe.
[00:27:13.293 --> 00:27:25.364]  I'm just letting your fans know that they're being sucked into another pump and dump on the old Bitcoin with the hope down the road that out of the crises comes regulation that makes it the one currency.
[00:27:25.624 --> 00:27:26.705]  How authoritarian is that?
[00:27:27.686 --> 00:27:29.207]  He's also pushing through his platform.
[00:27:29.508 --> 00:27:31.930]  It's already the dominant platform.
[00:27:33.448 --> 00:27:36.211]  Square Cash, that it only be Bitcoin.
[00:27:36.371 --> 00:27:38.252]  That no one even knows who made or where it came from.
[00:27:38.633 --> 00:27:40.194]  Definitely a world government move.
[00:27:40.555 --> 00:27:43.998]  Definitely to position to block other cryptocurrencies in the future.
[00:27:44.498 --> 00:27:45.879]  They definitely tried to seduce me.
[00:27:45.899 --> 00:27:52.825]  I remember how pissed one of them got when they offered me, I guess at its peak, it would be like $40 million worth of Bitcoin.
[00:27:53.686 --> 00:27:54.747]  And I wouldn't take it.
[00:27:54.847 --> 00:27:56.549]  And they got so pissed.
[00:27:58.422 --> 00:28:02.185]  And of course, I got told, oh, I hang out with George Soros and stuff.
[00:28:02.205 --> 00:28:03.266]  You know, his son's pretty nice.
[00:28:03.546 --> 00:28:06.028]  Hey, you might not be so mean to him.
[00:28:06.228 --> 00:28:08.330]  You might come to New York sometime, up to Connecticut, and meet him.
[00:28:09.892 --> 00:28:18.238]  And I've tried, I mean, these guys have tried to recruit me so many times, it'll make my head spin.
[00:28:19.557 --> 00:28:20.198]  See, they don't get it.
[00:28:20.298 --> 00:28:21.239]  They think I'm stupid.
[00:28:21.739 --> 00:28:22.600]  I go with my spirit.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.984]  I let it ripen, you see, while I'm learning and scanning and watching.
[00:28:27.504 --> 00:28:36.893]  And then, when it's time to cut down a tree or butcher a hog, that's when I pull the knife out.
[00:28:37.473 --> 00:28:37.813]  Politically.
[00:28:38.774 --> 00:28:40.276]  And people are like, well, you might get destroyed.
[00:28:45.342 --> 00:28:49.083]  You realize that if you were in God's presence, you would not be afraid of the devil.
[00:28:49.124 --> 00:28:52.245]  You'd be absolutely on your knees before him.
[00:28:52.305 --> 00:28:55.206]  Total eternity and absolute complete knowledge.
[00:28:56.206 --> 00:28:57.607]  Yeah, I'm with God.
[00:28:57.947 --> 00:29:02.909]  You guys can go with the devil.
[00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:04.950]  It took us over a year to develop it.
[00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.731]  Thousands and thousands of five-star reviews.
[00:29:08.809 --> 00:29:09.810]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:15.134]  I'm so proud of you and the InfoWars team for all that you do.
[00:29:15.234 --> 00:29:16.875]  I wanted to say I love your product.
[00:29:17.095 --> 00:29:19.417]  The Brain Force Plus is amazing.
[00:29:19.437 --> 00:29:24.681]  Me and my family take it every day and I mean you really can feel what it does.
[00:29:24.701 --> 00:29:32.947]  We were able to develop Brain Force because we went out and looked at what the best-selling nootropics or brain focus energy products were.
[00:29:33.607 --> 00:29:35.388]  And we decided to make it even stronger
[00:29:36.369 --> 00:29:40.171]  And even more high quality and even more organic than leading competitors.
[00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:42.573]  And we've done it with Brain Force Plus.
[00:29:42.633 --> 00:29:46.775]  It is our number one bestseller in gross bottles sold.
[00:29:47.696 --> 00:29:52.059]  Now I made the decision in our marketing to put a lot of product in it and sell it for a low price.
[00:29:52.699 --> 00:30:00.101]  Believing that you're smart, you'll research the market, get a great result, know you're getting a great deal, and be routine, continued customers.
[00:30:00.501 --> 00:30:04.062]  I want a long-term relationship with you, and I want a product that I'm proud of that I'm going to use.
[00:30:04.482 --> 00:30:05.702]  It's up there as the very best.
[00:30:06.022 --> 00:30:08.643]  There are nootropics that are $80 a bottle that aren't as good.
[00:30:08.943 --> 00:30:10.163]  They have some of the similar ingredients.
[00:30:10.783 --> 00:30:13.744]  But, you know, a doctor sells it at their office, so it must be better.
[00:30:14.904 --> 00:30:21.486]  Ladies and gentlemen, we then stood back and said, what is the number one best-selling thing in the total market globally?
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:22.700]  I don't
[00:30:42.964 --> 00:30:49.025]  Top people in the country who has developed some of the other top energy drinks in the nation and in the world.
[00:30:49.445 --> 00:30:53.206]  And they developed TurboForce that is the next level.
[00:30:53.746 --> 00:30:54.687]  Long burn.
[00:30:54.707 --> 00:30:56.907]  A lot of folks up to 10 hours of energy.
[00:30:56.967 --> 00:30:58.007]  Me, 6, 7, 8 hours.
[00:30:58.387 --> 00:30:59.928]  And I take about a half a pack and it's so strong.
[00:31:00.288 --> 00:31:05.849]  And then it's got all the minerals and all the different amino acids that help deliver the energy into the body.
[00:31:06.618 --> 00:31:20.441]  And that's why I want to thank all the listeners who've been BrainForce fans with 50% off BrainForce, because the two go together to supply yourself and your family with your nootropic with TurboForce, ladies and gentlemen, so you can try it.
[00:31:20.801 --> 00:31:27.642]  It's 33% off, and you get it in the combo, 50% off on BrainForce for a limited time at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:31:28.122 --> 00:31:30.743]  One is a pill, one is a packet.
[00:31:31.223 --> 00:31:35.524]  And again, the first time you take TurboForce, I recommend you only take half a packet, because let me tell you,
[00:31:36.559 --> 00:31:39.983]  Folks I know that are totally into energy drinks said they've never seen anything like it.
[00:31:40.344 --> 00:31:41.885]  Most energy drinks hit in 20-30 minutes.
[00:31:41.905 --> 00:31:46.030]  A lot of people get hit in 5 minutes with turbo force.
[00:31:46.491 --> 00:31:51.436]  But again, it doesn't just hit fast, it lasts super, super long because the developers
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:32:00.322]  That we reached out to had the mission of having something that gives you continual clean energy over a long period of time.
[00:32:00.662 --> 00:32:05.864]  So the different compounds that are in this, that synergistically work together, have different burn rates.
[00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:09.785]  Almost like a Saturn rocket's got three different components.
[00:32:11.289 --> 00:32:11.750]  See what I mean?
[00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:19.960]  It launches, you get the main boost phase, then you get up into orbit, you got your next phase, you get to the moon, land on the moon, come back to the Earth.
[00:32:20.341 --> 00:32:24.146]  You've got all those different phases here, ladies and gentlemen, to get you throughout the day.
[00:32:24.566 --> 00:32:25.387]  Boost in the morning!
[00:32:26.328 --> 00:32:31.529]  Continue on through your interstellar day, conquering, exploring, dominating.
[00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:34.410]  And listen, I like to ride my horse and shoot my gun.
[00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.411]  You know, a country boy's work is really never done.
[00:32:37.831 --> 00:32:45.053]  And after you put the kids down to bed with the missus there in your arms, you can do a repair job and fix the cable like all good Americans do.
[00:32:45.573 --> 00:32:46.573]  And all thanks to TurboForce.
[00:32:47.274 --> 00:32:51.855]  So again, coming to you, ladies and gentlemen, from the founding system,
[00:32:52.635 --> 00:32:56.901]  Of turbo force and brain force, I bring you this incredible product at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:32:57.121 --> 00:32:58.623]  Get the energy combo today.
[00:32:58.883 --> 00:33:00.445]  Oh, and fund the InfoWars and change the world.
[00:33:00.646 --> 00:33:01.467]  I forgot about that part too.
[00:33:06.653 --> 00:33:09.317]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.128 --> 00:33:21.310]  In today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully activists.
[00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:30.133]  If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshippers, maybe you can call the A-Team.
[00:33:32.334 --> 00:33:34.374]  How many did I adopt?
[00:33:34.394 --> 00:33:35.134]  I kill my kids.
[00:33:35.614 --> 00:33:36.875]  I kill my kids.
[00:33:39.753 --> 00:33:45.617]  It's the one f****** famous racist f****** veil that doesn't stand for women's rights.
[00:33:45.637 --> 00:33:46.137]  Get the f*** out of here!
[00:33:46.177 --> 00:33:49.840]  Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle.
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:50.740]  That's pretty cool, man.
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.442]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[00:33:53.522 --> 00:33:55.683]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[00:33:56.464 --> 00:33:57.364]  I don't think so.
[00:33:57.844 --> 00:34:00.886]  Don't hurt children!
[00:34:00.966 --> 00:34:01.807]  I f****** love Satan!
[00:34:01.867 --> 00:34:04.008]  How do you get your abortion speed?
[00:34:07.626 --> 00:34:08.767]  I pay for them.
[00:34:08.827 --> 00:34:09.067]  Really?
[00:34:09.147 --> 00:34:12.269]  How many do you pay for them?
[00:34:12.369 --> 00:34:13.249]  Uh, upwards of 50.
[00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:15.791]  Really?
[00:34:16.111 --> 00:34:17.812]  Oh yeah.
[00:34:17.932 --> 00:34:19.493]  F**k you, you piece of s**t!
[00:34:19.913 --> 00:34:21.714]  Bunch of misogynist motherf**kers.
[00:34:21.754 --> 00:34:23.876]  Take your male privilege somewhere else.
[00:34:23.976 --> 00:34:25.697]  Robert, you're being aggressive.
[00:34:25.717 --> 00:34:28.238]  I'm being aggressive?
[00:34:28.278 --> 00:34:28.919]  Come on, Alex!
[00:34:28.939 --> 00:34:29.099]  Use us!
[00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:29.539]  Wow!
[00:34:29.559 --> 00:34:30.099]  Watch out!
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.202]  These stacks think that I set to attack Alex Jones.
[00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:47.613]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:51.636 --> 00:34:52.717]  Mike Adams just called in.
[00:34:52.777 --> 00:34:54.058]  He's gonna get hooked up on Skype.
[00:34:54.119 --> 00:34:58.342]  He wants to say something about Joe Rogan and Bitcoin and all these scams that are going on.
[00:34:58.362 --> 00:35:09.071]  The air starts to rumble while towers fall.
[00:35:15.331 --> 00:35:24.097]  Let's hear a little bit more of this.
[00:35:25.378 --> 00:35:29.281]  Just like the Pied Piper.
[00:35:29.381 --> 00:35:30.702]  Let rats loose.
[00:35:31.783 --> 00:35:33.204]  Just like the Pied Piper.
[00:35:34.545 --> 00:35:37.747]  Led your children away.
[00:35:37.807 --> 00:35:43.671]  That's what he really came for.
[00:35:47.393 --> 00:36:01.679]  Every fairytale, in every culture, and every legend, is a sitcom for the children.
[00:36:01.699 --> 00:36:04.901]  Actin' like a robot, the metalhead corrodes.
[00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:14.192]  Try to take his pulse.
[00:36:14.432 --> 00:36:17.794]  Before the head explodes.
[00:36:17.894 --> 00:36:25.117]  I'm here to tell you something.
[00:36:25.518 --> 00:36:30.300]  Within... 20 years...
[00:36:38.326 --> 00:36:40.367]  Nothing you see is going to be left standing.
[00:36:42.028 --> 00:36:43.568]  None of it.
[00:36:43.648 --> 00:36:45.349]  All these billionaires are going to be dead.
[00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:48.090]  Most of the cities are going to be destroyed.
[00:36:48.891 --> 00:36:50.511]  Billions will be gone.
[00:36:52.172 --> 00:36:52.632]  Know it now.
[00:36:54.113 --> 00:37:01.936]  Their plan to orderly exterminate the population has already begun the countdown to destruction.
[00:37:02.776 --> 00:37:04.217]  There is no way to reverse it.
[00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:13.294]  And their bunkers, like Pharaoh's tools, will be their prisons.
[00:37:13.695 --> 00:37:14.195]  Built by them.
[00:37:15.576 --> 00:37:15.996]  For them.
[00:37:18.838 --> 00:37:20.099]  Nothing will be left standing.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:23.141]  None of it.
[00:37:23.621 --> 00:37:26.063]  All of you that signed on to it.
[00:37:26.143 --> 00:37:28.204]  Las Vegas, Los Angeles.
[00:37:28.784 --> 00:37:31.166]  They'll all be giant tombstones in the desert.
[00:37:32.026 --> 00:37:32.867]  But not just there.
[00:37:33.427 --> 00:37:34.228]  San Francisco.
[00:37:37.022 --> 00:37:37.602]  New York City.
[00:37:38.883 --> 00:37:39.764]  Houston, Texas.
[00:37:40.325 --> 00:37:40.765]  Gone.
[00:37:44.768 --> 00:37:59.100]  You think we can kill hundreds of millions of babies and splice their genes with cows and mice and rats for unholy operations and that we won't be judged by the universe itself?
[00:38:01.902 --> 00:38:02.903]  DrudgeReport.com.
[00:38:04.209 --> 00:38:05.270]  Without even looking.
[00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:06.951]  I can't even get away from it.
[00:38:07.311 --> 00:38:09.733]  I told you this 23 years ago.
[00:38:10.874 --> 00:38:13.115]  What's their number one attack on me after Sandy Hook?
[00:38:15.037 --> 00:38:15.797]  And gay frogs.
[00:38:18.499 --> 00:38:18.879]  What is it?
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:20.260]  What is it?
[00:38:21.641 --> 00:38:27.666]  It's Jones is crazy and claims there's animal human chimeras.
[00:38:29.736 --> 00:38:36.501]  Yeah, it was in research literature 25 years ago that it was going on decades before.
[00:38:36.861 --> 00:38:39.363]  I mean, I'm talking MIT folks.
[00:38:40.243 --> 00:38:44.926]  Wasn't photos of it, but it was pigs that are nothing but pure meat.
[00:38:48.529 --> 00:38:51.871]  It was salmon that are three times bigger and will take over the whole ocean.
[00:38:51.911 --> 00:38:55.974]  It was goats that are part spider to create body armor.
[00:38:59.264 --> 00:39:09.312]  And I was just going, wow, this is in science literature, because I was covering things on air, so people were sending me, who were engineers and scientists, stuff that was not on the news.
[00:39:10.553 --> 00:39:19.240]  And let me tell you, I would talk about cable boxes with microphones in them 20 years ago, and they would have the U.S.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:24.805]  Army show up in parking lots at Target and threaten to kill me if I talked about it again.
[00:39:25.663 --> 00:39:27.544]  See, back then, they don't want people to be warned.
[00:39:28.065 --> 00:39:30.066]  And I said, you go ahead and do what you need to, buddy.
[00:39:31.027 --> 00:39:32.908]  Just remember this, God's gonna judge you.
[00:39:34.329 --> 00:39:37.792]  So, it's on drugs right now that they're splicing babies with mice.
[00:39:39.072 --> 00:39:40.954]  Folks, they were doing that 50 years ago.
[00:39:41.014 --> 00:39:41.454]  You know why?
[00:39:41.734 --> 00:39:47.378]  We're mostly genetically akin, if you want to get to it, it's not to chimpanzees, but to pigs and to mice.
[00:39:48.939 --> 00:39:50.681]  And that's why they've been doing it there first, folks.
[00:39:51.821 --> 00:39:52.462]  Pigs and mice.
[00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:59.238]  Humans and our genetics just take to those like ducks to water.
[00:39:59.258 --> 00:40:03.968]  We're going to come back with Mike Adams to get into some of this, but there's no doubt now.
[00:40:05.233 --> 00:40:07.394]  That this is an interdimensional alien invasion.
[00:40:07.514 --> 00:40:09.074]  And you notice, they don't ever play me saying that.
[00:40:09.094 --> 00:40:10.755]  They don't attack it in the news because they know it.
[00:40:11.035 --> 00:40:13.196]  San Francisco, all of them, they worship it.
[00:40:13.496 --> 00:40:17.077]  They worship, they believe that they are... If you read the Bible, it's exactly that.
[00:40:17.098 --> 00:40:19.578]  A literal, lower-level dimensional attack.
[00:40:19.598 --> 00:40:28.882]  And that's why, when you run into these things, they're so low-level, they're so stupid, they're so hateful, and all they want to do, like zombies, is kill people and attack children.
[00:40:29.362 --> 00:40:33.944]  So... I guess it's the operating system of this thing that makes us all kill each other.
[00:40:34.878 --> 00:40:52.211]  I mean, I'm not... I've looked at every angle of it, but the point is, the Pentagon and everybody else, and I had General Stubblebine who ran the operations about this, they were giving volunteers, like astronauts, megadoses of drugs, okay, with wires hooked into their brains, and they were in interdimensional meetings with the damn aliens, giving them technology, okay?
[00:40:52.411 --> 00:40:54.512]  You don't meet the aliens in a flying saucer by the moon.
[00:40:54.812 --> 00:40:57.694]  You meet them in this interdimensional vortex.
[00:40:58.155 --> 00:40:59.216]  I'm not the one saying it.
[00:40:59.536 --> 00:41:00.817]  They're the ones that are doing it!
[00:41:02.315 --> 00:41:04.656]  Hell, Buzz Aldrin told me all this stuff, too, off air.
[00:41:04.936 --> 00:41:05.576]  He's been on the show.
[00:41:05.837 --> 00:41:07.477]  I mean, they all know about it.
[00:41:07.877 --> 00:41:12.059]  And Trump and others are saying, man, let's not blow the planet up and kill everybody.
[00:41:12.479 --> 00:41:15.441]  And the Democrats and the globalists are like, they're the anti-human party.
[00:41:15.681 --> 00:41:17.101]  They're the collaborators with it.
[00:41:17.281 --> 00:41:18.042]  Call it the devil.
[00:41:18.282 --> 00:41:19.002]  Call it aliens.
[00:41:19.222 --> 00:41:27.726]  Whatever it is, man, I've had three star generals on that had people with wires hooked in their brains in damn two-year meetings with aliens that lasted one second long.
[00:41:29.977 --> 00:41:31.018]  I mean, you understand, folks?
[00:41:31.079 --> 00:41:32.360]  That's what the Pentagon does.
[00:41:32.561 --> 00:41:33.402]  That's what's going on.
[00:41:33.582 --> 00:41:34.403]  It's already happening.
[00:41:34.503 --> 00:41:35.645]  It's been happening for decades.
[00:41:38.789 --> 00:41:41.973]  And any aliens that'll contact this planet are bad, folks.
[00:41:43.215 --> 00:41:45.298]  God doesn't contact us because of free will.
[00:41:47.045 --> 00:41:49.186]  This is like a flu or cancer we have.
[00:41:49.226 --> 00:41:49.946]  This crap!
[00:41:50.726 --> 00:41:52.667]  And everyone knows it at a genetic level.
[00:41:53.107 --> 00:41:56.789]  That we're far superior to these damn zombies.
[00:41:57.349 --> 00:42:08.113]  So they tell us to give in to them and submit to them and go along with all this and have no morals so that they can run their operating system and poison the sky and the genetics and irrevocably attack us.
[00:42:08.353 --> 00:42:10.014]  We are under attack!
[00:42:10.934 --> 00:42:12.354]  We are under attack!
[00:42:12.614 --> 00:42:14.155]  This is not of this world!
[00:42:14.695 --> 00:42:15.555]  What's the devil say?
[00:42:16.275 --> 00:42:17.815]  Not of this world!
[00:42:18.436 --> 00:42:20.256]  And nothing bites like I do!
[00:42:20.796 --> 00:42:24.017]  Nothing screams out loud in the dark of night!
[00:42:25.437 --> 00:42:26.597]  That's what we're dealing with!
[00:42:27.517 --> 00:42:28.138]  A spirit!
[00:42:28.418 --> 00:42:28.938]  A force!
[00:42:29.238 --> 00:42:29.978]  A broadcast!
[00:42:30.238 --> 00:42:30.878]  Kill yourselves!
[00:42:30.978 --> 00:42:31.558]  Kill yourselves!
[00:42:31.718 --> 00:42:32.278]  Kill yourselves!
[00:42:32.458 --> 00:42:32.919]  Kill yourselves!
[00:42:33.159 --> 00:42:34.599]  You dial into the Globalist Channel, it's...
[00:42:36.189 --> 00:42:36.869]  Just like death metal.
[00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:39.871]  You can be the best death metal singer ever.
[00:42:40.112 --> 00:42:41.753]  Hell, I can just dial into their frequency!
[00:42:42.213 --> 00:42:43.033]  That's all you hear!
[00:42:43.053 --> 00:42:48.597]  You can hear the frequency, they're turning the damn thing up, and they go, oh, you sound like a schizophrenic!
[00:42:48.957 --> 00:42:52.359]  Schizophrenics are people that have already fallen to this stuff, or can't handle it.
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:56.082]  That's why perception is so narrowed, so that these people can't handle this.
[00:42:56.522 --> 00:42:57.963]  I'm not the one saying all this.
[00:42:58.423 --> 00:43:02.146]  San Francisco big tech literally worship aliens.
[00:43:05.024 --> 00:43:07.061]  I don't believe the globalists are that smart.
[00:43:10.368 --> 00:43:21.814]  I don't believe you're that stupid that we have this information and that if they shut me down, it's shut down when these pieces of crap are executing this information in front of everybody.
[00:43:21.834 --> 00:43:27.356]  Do you know why there have been layoffs at more than 20 major leftist fake news publications?
[00:43:27.516 --> 00:43:29.838]  From BuzzFeed to Newsweek to Vice.
[00:43:30.018 --> 00:43:31.218]  Why did it all happen this week?
[00:43:31.318 --> 00:43:33.960]  Why didn't it happen a month ago or a month from now?
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.620]  Why wasn't it doled out?
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.922]  Because it's concerted.
[00:43:39.222 --> 00:43:44.325]  It's like a bombing run with a group of bombers flying in and they've all got targets.
[00:43:44.826 --> 00:43:47.327]  And they're all commanded by their HQ.
[00:43:47.567 --> 00:43:49.628]  And by the way, I don't just think that.
[00:43:49.809 --> 00:43:50.869]  I have their blueprint.
[00:43:51.049 --> 00:43:52.250]  I have their bombing run.
[00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:53.711]  I have their attack profile.
[00:43:53.991 --> 00:43:55.432]  I have their Achilles.
[00:43:56.192 --> 00:43:59.094]  And I'm here telling you their Achilles.
[00:43:59.775 --> 00:44:01.676]  I'm here telling you how to defeat them.
[00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:03.777]  Real intelligence is observation.
[00:44:04.918 --> 00:44:06.479]  Real intelligence is infiltration.
[00:44:07.481 --> 00:44:12.528]  Real intelligence is interfacing banging heads with your enemy.
[00:44:13.389 --> 00:44:20.038]  Because you begin to know your enemy better than the enemy knows you.
[00:44:20.539 --> 00:44:21.920]  All real warfare.
[00:44:22.381 --> 00:44:24.123]  What's victorious is psychic.
[00:44:24.283 --> 00:44:30.409]  It can be physical, but that's only to draw out the essence of the enemy's goals and their fears.
[00:44:30.689 --> 00:44:34.913]  And then the commitment to meet your enemy with your goals and your love.
[00:44:35.233 --> 00:44:36.214]  Love trumps all.
[00:44:36.294 --> 00:44:40.898]  But you have to realistically have the template of victory to be able to take it on.
[00:44:41.659 --> 00:44:54.210]  You can't counter a civilizational ending event, a planned viral demolition of humanity, a earth-ending termination of the birth of a new species, a new vision, a new world.
[00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:58.073]  You can't counter something like that with lack of vision.
[00:44:58.213 --> 00:44:59.895]  Simply countering their program.
[00:44:59.975 --> 00:45:08.302]  You must offer the world that you see and see if others believe in that world and see how they will then offer information to that world to build
[00:45:08.842 --> 00:45:11.284]  You have to recruit in a war.
[00:45:11.524 --> 00:45:16.308]  And to do that, you need to look for people that aren't just trying to be in charge of something.
[00:45:16.348 --> 00:45:19.470]  You need to look for people that want to be involved in something.
[00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:21.232]  Involved in something bigger than them.
[00:45:21.652 --> 00:45:24.434]  Not because they want to rule people, but because they love people.
[00:45:24.514 --> 00:45:31.299]  Because they love their ancestors, and they love humanity, and they have a vision that they want to add to in the future.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:37.904]  So that all the victories and the successes of our progeny, when we're the ancestors,
[00:45:40.672 --> 00:45:40.812]  Yeah.
[00:45:57.366 --> 00:45:57.926]  We're good to go.
[00:46:22.256 --> 00:46:24.437]  And that's why I know we're going to win in the end.
[00:46:24.537 --> 00:46:49.332]  But I want to ask you to commit, by word of mouth and by prayer, in the public realm and in personal soul, but also in the physical, the energy you expend every day in the system, to transfer part of that to us, to know that there is a full commitment to push our will against the enemy with everything we've got, and to lean in when their knives are stabbing into our guts, to lean into their hate, and just lean in and take it.
[00:46:50.092 --> 00:46:50.553]  I'm ready.
[00:46:51.233 --> 00:46:52.495]  And I'll lean in and I'll take it.
[00:46:52.795 --> 00:46:58.681]  But I need your backing so that when I swing my sword, it'll absolutely devastate the enemy.
[00:46:58.701 --> 00:47:01.885]  And when I raise my shield, it's your will that empowers it.
[00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:09.233]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:20.047 --> 00:47:24.008]  Awaiting the hour of the prizing.
[00:47:24.548 --> 00:47:26.908]  The time slips away.
[00:47:27.228 --> 00:47:28.009]  All of you devils.
[00:47:29.929 --> 00:47:30.649]  All of you enemies.
[00:47:31.089 --> 00:47:31.809]  All of you collaborators.
[00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:40.591]  Just wait until you get dumped in the Phantom Zone.
[00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:42.091]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:42.551 --> 00:47:45.052]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:47:58.462 --> 00:48:00.123]  Alright, now getting back to what I'm covering here.
[00:48:00.143 --> 00:48:02.803]  People always wanted me to cover space aliens and all this other stuff.
[00:48:02.823 --> 00:48:06.465]  I never got into all that because I was covering political stuff and the Federal Reserve and how it all works.
[00:48:06.485 --> 00:48:15.727]  But in decades of research, in decades of high-level contacts and people in Hollywood and billionaires reaching out and all of it, it's like Elon Musk went on Joe Rogan's show.
[00:48:17.448 --> 00:48:19.989]  About a year after I did and repeated everything I said and said it was all true.
[00:48:20.769 --> 00:48:22.410]  According to the cults he's in.
[00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:24.830]  Or the cults they let him into.
[00:48:25.671 --> 00:48:26.711]  And he's freaked out and scared.
[00:48:28.117 --> 00:48:29.138]  So he tried to come tell you.
[00:48:30.199 --> 00:48:32.141]  I don't believe in space aliens and all this stuff.
[00:48:32.421 --> 00:48:33.562]  The globalists do.
[00:48:34.003 --> 00:48:35.584]  See, people say, well, you don't believe in the devil.
[00:48:36.445 --> 00:48:37.206]  The devil believes in you.
[00:48:37.846 --> 00:48:38.667]  We're going to Mike Adams.
[00:48:39.888 --> 00:48:40.388]  I don't plug.
[00:48:40.429 --> 00:48:41.209]  I'm our own worst enemy.
[00:48:41.309 --> 00:48:45.914]  And I got to tell you, I am our own worst enemy.
[00:48:48.156 --> 00:48:49.257]  If you don't habituate
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:56.002]  To go, you know, not just get a t-shirt, the reason coffee and toothpaste and stuff is so great is you have to buy it every month.
[00:48:56.442 --> 00:48:58.323]  And you get the coffee, you're like, damn, this is really good coffee.
[00:48:58.583 --> 00:49:00.304]  Sign up for auto-ship, an additional 10% off.
[00:49:00.744 --> 00:49:05.125]  Toothpaste, coiled silver, iodine fortified, concentrated, you're like, super, this is the best toothpaste I've ever had.
[00:49:06.286 --> 00:49:06.486]  Yeah.
[00:49:07.506 --> 00:49:12.048]  But when we make like, you know, a little bit of money, I mean, the coffee, we discount it so much.
[00:49:12.528 --> 00:49:16.970]  The same coffee from Chiapas, since we got it from the same distributor, is sold at Whole Foods for $10 more.
[00:49:20.114 --> 00:49:21.415]  I'm making like eight bucks on this.
[00:49:21.615 --> 00:49:22.976]  I'm making like three, four bucks on the toothpaste.
[00:49:24.377 --> 00:49:26.258]  So I gotta sell a ton of it.
[00:49:27.239 --> 00:49:32.443]  But remember, metaphysically, I can only give you a good deal because that's how I want to be treated.
[00:49:32.763 --> 00:49:33.324]  That's a rule.
[00:49:34.504 --> 00:49:36.566]  And the more you get into that rule, you can't ever get out of the rule.
[00:49:38.888 --> 00:49:45.189]  I've talked to a lot of top marketers that go, look, if you just put crap in it and sell it for 10 times what it's worth, you'll be out of all your issues, have all the funding.
[00:49:45.209 --> 00:49:46.530]  But then I'd already sold out, see?
[00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:51.951]  Why didn't I just sell out when they offered me $40 million in frickin' Bitcoin eight years ago to push it?
[00:49:53.051 --> 00:49:54.631]  Because I can't do it.
[00:49:55.311 --> 00:49:59.172]  Or a year and a half ago, it was up to a million a month they were offering to push this stuff.
[00:49:59.472 --> 00:50:00.752]  And again, I'm not saying it's all bad.
[00:50:00.832 --> 00:50:02.873]  I'm saying it's who's behind it and how it's being manipulated.
[00:50:03.849 --> 00:50:04.449]  I need funding.
[00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:06.231]  And I know you don't want the enemy to win.
[00:50:06.711 --> 00:50:08.632]  And I sit here going, red alert, red alert, need your help.
[00:50:08.692 --> 00:50:10.133]  It's because you are the InfoWar.
[00:50:10.393 --> 00:50:11.074]  It's like oxygen.
[00:50:11.254 --> 00:50:11.894]  I need air.
[00:50:12.815 --> 00:50:17.298]  And my heart has to beat 60 times in a minute or whatever.
[00:50:20.379 --> 00:50:21.180]  It's like three meals a day.
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.701]  It has to come in.
[00:50:22.721 --> 00:50:23.441]  It has to come in.
[00:50:23.481 --> 00:50:24.081]  It has to come in.
[00:50:24.402 --> 00:50:26.983]  So thank you for your support, but these are products you absolutely need.
[00:50:27.223 --> 00:50:33.287]  We have big specials right now on BrainForce Plus and on our latest product that goes with it, TurboForce, that's just beyond description.
[00:50:34.208 --> 00:50:38.511]  Warning, it's very natural, very strong, and lasts a lot longer than the other crappy energy drinks.
[00:50:38.611 --> 00:50:39.271]  It is next level.
[00:50:39.291 --> 00:50:41.272]  It's the best that the top developers come up with.
[00:50:41.572 --> 00:50:43.494]  Infowarslife.com or AAA253-3139.
[00:50:43.514 --> 00:50:45.215]  But just thank you for your support, but please commit.
[00:50:47.236 --> 00:50:48.757]  To get the products and support us.
[00:50:48.837 --> 00:50:50.218]  Get a t-shirt, get a book, get a video.
[00:50:50.778 --> 00:50:53.400]  And at the same time, also spread the word.
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:57.422]  Because that's every day in the trenches of this wrestling match.
[00:50:57.742 --> 00:50:58.723]  This 5,000 round war.
[00:50:59.383 --> 00:51:01.505]  And we're like 4,000 rounds into it right now.
[00:51:01.545 --> 00:51:02.905]  But there's another 1,000 rounds left.
[00:51:03.306 --> 00:51:04.266]  And we just gotta go.
[00:51:04.286 --> 00:51:09.269]  You gotta commit and just get in the focused zone and turbo over this.
[00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:10.750]  And that's what's gonna happen.
[00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:12.471]  Okay, I appreciate Mike Adams wanting to pop in.
[00:51:12.491 --> 00:51:13.232]  He wanted to talk about
[00:51:13.992 --> 00:51:14.552]  I don't know.
[00:51:33.314 --> 00:51:36.857]  The owner of Twitter did say that, but he said that obviously he was the owner.
[00:51:37.237 --> 00:51:39.379]  And so it's just very unscrupulous here.
[00:51:39.679 --> 00:51:41.761]  That's dialing into one show.
[00:51:41.781 --> 00:51:43.202]  I don't watch Joe's show.
[00:51:43.702 --> 00:51:45.464]  And so it's like, it's dirty.
[00:51:46.411 --> 00:51:49.874]  And you know, Joe was calling me last night and stuff, and again, the phone was off.
[00:51:51.795 --> 00:51:52.756]  I just covered the State of the Union.
[00:51:52.776 --> 00:51:53.677]  It was like 11 o'clock at night.
[00:51:54.057 --> 00:51:55.278]  So I haven't talked to Joe.
[00:51:55.619 --> 00:51:56.599]  This isn't about Joe.
[00:51:56.619 --> 00:51:58.101]  This isn't about me coming back on your show.
[00:51:58.181 --> 00:51:58.981]  You have to understand something.
[00:51:59.802 --> 00:52:01.443]  This is not about me being cool.
[00:52:01.563 --> 00:52:02.804]  I'm not out in Hollywood, bro, okay?
[00:52:02.844 --> 00:52:04.506]  It's about I've got to be clean, okay?
[00:52:05.246 --> 00:52:09.650]  And I feel dirty that I had some concerns about you for a long time.
[00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:10.451]  I didn't do anything about it.
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:13.301]  Because I've never sold out, and I'm not going to start now.
[00:52:13.461 --> 00:52:16.984]  And it's just, everybody's kind of waking up to the fact that you're the establishment's darling.
[00:52:17.244 --> 00:52:18.625]  So I don't take pleasure in fighting.
[00:52:18.925 --> 00:52:20.005]  I don't do this stuff.
[00:52:20.826 --> 00:52:26.690]  But Joe Rogan, in their globalist model, they think is a key player in the deception.
[00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:36.981]  So joining us is Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com, an engineer and software programmer, par excellence, and a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, I would say, expert.
[00:52:37.342 --> 00:52:44.370]  What is your take on all this and why you would, because I'm always trying to get you on, you're too busy to come on, why you would say, hey, get me on right now?
[00:52:45.578 --> 00:53:05.075]  Well first Alex, I want to say that on the cosmic extermination agenda that you have been talking about, I just want to affirm that you are 100% on track, that the call has gone out to exterminate humanity, and this is why Democrats are now pro-infanticide, this is why they love the idea of murdering Christians,
[00:53:05.695 --> 00:53:11.079]  Murdering conservatives, killing Trump, they're all about death and execution now because the order has come down.
[00:53:11.439 --> 00:53:19.505]  So what you've said, for example, about Atrazine making amphibians alter their gender expression, you know, making the frogs gay, it's 100% true.
[00:53:19.526 --> 00:53:20.346]  We've confirmed
[00:53:22.027 --> 00:53:22.568]  We're good.
[00:53:40.382 --> 00:53:45.166]  Because if he did, that he knows Google and Facebook would destroy his entire platform.
[00:53:45.546 --> 00:53:49.890]  And he was asking me, begging me, practically in tears, what should he do?
[00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:52.932]  And I said, look, man, you got to decide for yourself.
[00:53:53.072 --> 00:53:55.354]  But I'm speaking out for humanity.
[00:53:55.814 --> 00:53:58.677]  Alex Jones is on Team Humanity, and I'm with Team Humanity.
[00:53:58.997 --> 00:54:00.238]  And you got to decide what you want to do.
[00:54:00.278 --> 00:54:04.301]  But yeah, if you tell the truth, if you defend Alex, you're going to be absolutely destroyed on these platforms.
[00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:07.344]  But Alex, people are calling me about this issue.
[00:54:07.364 --> 00:54:08.825]  I just wanted to be on the record about that.
[00:54:09.631 --> 00:54:10.412]  Let me throw this at you.
[00:54:10.452 --> 00:54:11.612]  I mean, we go in the next hour.
[00:54:11.632 --> 00:54:13.634]  I know you got to go soon, but I want to get into Bitcoin.
[00:54:14.194 --> 00:54:20.418]  I got a call this weekend, and they were pretty hot, and then later they said, well, don't give the specifics.
[00:54:20.438 --> 00:54:22.940]  First it was, you know, kind of go there, later, well, don't go there.
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:29.424]  But a very famous military veteran who has TV shows, they're begging him to do all the shows.
[00:54:30.585 --> 00:54:32.927]  They said, well, we want you to do this big hit show.
[00:54:33.687 --> 00:54:35.789]  And it's going to be, you know, on these bigger channels than ever.
[00:54:36.229 --> 00:54:39.852]  But you've got to come out against Alex Jones, and you've got to denounce him.
[00:54:40.413 --> 00:54:41.614]  And the guy pushed through you.
[00:54:42.054 --> 00:54:43.836]  But see, it's a litmus test.
[00:54:43.856 --> 00:54:45.497]  Because as you said, the order has come down.
[00:54:45.958 --> 00:54:47.599]  They're literally, we're going to kill babies.
[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:49.020]  Humanity sucks.
[00:54:49.381 --> 00:54:50.502]  The human era is over.
[00:54:50.562 --> 00:54:52.764]  And all of the world, there's pro-human parties.
[00:54:53.184 --> 00:54:54.865]  It's not even like you said, capitalist versus whatever.
[00:54:55.666 --> 00:54:58.408]  It's not even, no, it's pro-human versus anti-human.
[00:54:58.448 --> 00:55:00.811]  This is literally a directive.
[00:55:01.491 --> 00:55:05.053]  And you've got a so-called ruling class that has to sign on to this.
[00:55:06.573 --> 00:55:09.415]  They have stopped threatening me, by the way.
[00:55:10.295 --> 00:55:16.118]  Whoever has been behind this all these years, they've stopped threatening me because they know I'm not going to turn against humanity.
[00:55:16.458 --> 00:55:18.259]  They know I'm on Team Humanity.
[00:55:18.599 --> 00:55:20.300]  I'm going to defend your right to speak, Alex.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:24.982]  I'm going to defend your right to sell high-quality nutritional supplements, as you do, as I know.
[00:55:25.402 --> 00:55:28.305]  Because I've verified in the lab, you sell really high quality products.
[00:55:28.605 --> 00:55:30.667]  Very high quality, very clean products.
[00:55:31.148 --> 00:55:32.970]  I am not going to turn against humanity.
[00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:36.193]  So they've stopped bothering me, but they're going after everybody else in the industry.
[00:55:36.493 --> 00:55:40.697]  And they're trying to get people to turn against you and promising them wealth and riches and power.
[00:55:41.118 --> 00:55:43.680]  So look, this is the cosmic question.
[00:55:44.021 --> 00:55:46.023]  Do you turn against God?
[00:55:46.503 --> 00:55:48.125]  You know those influencers out there?
[00:55:48.145 --> 00:55:55.171]  Do they join Satan, have a contract with the devil, and get riches, and get influence, and get power by turning against humanity?
[00:55:55.391 --> 00:55:59.335]  Because that's the offer that's being made to people all across this industry.
[00:55:59.715 --> 00:56:12.466]  And those of us who stand for humanity, we are being vilified, defamed, slandered, punished, economically sabotaged, deplatformed in every way possible, lie after lie written about us, but here we still stand firm.
[00:56:12.847 --> 00:56:13.027]  I just
[00:56:13.621 --> 00:56:24.350]  You know, I've got something to say about Bitcoin and Rogan here, but I wanted to call in today and say, Alex, I recognize you, brother, for what you're doing for humanity, and I am with you in this fight.
[00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:29.194]  Humanity can survive, but we have to stand up now, or we will be destroyed.
[00:56:29.414 --> 00:56:30.335]  Well, Mike, I want to say this.
[00:56:30.415 --> 00:56:32.196]  It makes me sleep better at night knowing you're there.
[00:56:32.657 --> 00:56:36.300]  And it's not about... Once people realize what we're up against, it's not like you're a hero to fight this.
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:38.882]  This is literally... You're a scientist.
[00:56:38.922 --> 00:56:40.843]  You've done incredible broadcasts on this.
[00:56:41.884 --> 00:56:47.250]  They are trying to kill the earth and implode the atmosphere and poison every... They're trying to kill the plankton?
[00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:50.434]  I mean, we are under attack.
[00:56:51.075 --> 00:56:55.940]  We are under some kill switch has been thrown, whoever's behind it, the elite are in like...
[00:56:56.761 --> 00:56:59.522]  Meetings, interdimensional meetings with freaking aliens.
[00:56:59.862 --> 00:57:00.902]  And I'm not the one into this.
[00:57:01.002 --> 00:57:01.822]  They believe this.
[00:57:02.142 --> 00:57:03.163]  This is their religion.
[00:57:03.443 --> 00:57:04.343]  They're recruiting.
[00:57:04.623 --> 00:57:09.044]  They're in seminars when they're on these drugs and wire-headed in to all this crazy crap.
[00:57:09.064 --> 00:57:11.785]  We are facing an absolute collaborator group.
[00:57:11.825 --> 00:57:12.745]  This is the invasion.
[00:57:13.105 --> 00:57:16.306]  And notice, they never attack me when I say all this because they know it's true.
[00:57:16.606 --> 00:57:18.366]  Imagine how discrediting they think it would be to say all this.
[00:57:18.406 --> 00:57:19.306]  No, they don't touch it.
[00:57:19.326 --> 00:57:21.367]  They make up slave colonies on Mars.
[00:57:21.387 --> 00:57:21.827]  Never said.
[00:57:22.067 --> 00:57:23.227]  Because this is their religion.
[00:57:23.267 --> 00:57:24.728]  And you, you're a top programmer.
[00:57:24.748 --> 00:57:25.188]  You've been around.
[00:57:25.428 --> 00:57:25.968]  You know this.
[00:57:26.448 --> 00:57:28.069]  I mean, this is their religion, man!
[00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:39.577]  It's terraforming, it's poisoning the atmosphere, they're trying to shut down photosynthesis, they're trying to kill off the ecosystem while claiming they're saving the planet, they want to collapse the food supply, all that and much more.
[00:57:39.597 --> 00:57:44.340]  They're the guardians saying, humans are killing the earth, then they start killing it, and then they're the good guys.
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:46.041]  See, we told you it's gonna die!
[00:57:46.562 --> 00:57:47.722]  Oh my God, we'll be right back.
[00:57:47.742 --> 00:57:48.343]  They're a death cult.
[00:57:52.608 --> 00:57:59.972]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[00:58:00.592 --> 00:58:06.415]  And a lot of times we reach out to top companies and they don't want to private label to us because, well, we're InfoWars and we've been demonized.
[00:58:06.455 --> 00:58:10.757]  But a lot of times, people will work with us only because we're InfoWars.
[00:58:11.357 --> 00:58:26.950]  Well, there is a national company, and I'm not going to name them because we're not in competition with them, but we probably label their product, who has FDA approval for years to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there until you get to prescription level of wound gel that can be sold in stores.
[00:58:27.591 --> 00:58:34.476]  And we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[00:58:35.057 --> 00:58:36.678]  But the announcement here today is this.
[00:58:37.399 --> 00:58:40.881]  We've been selling a lot of the Wound Gel and a lot of the Immune Garden.
[00:58:41.322 --> 00:58:43.584]  In fact, we just put in big orders for both of them.
[00:58:44.344 --> 00:58:55.119]  But then I noticed without us even plugging it, because of all the scary stuff going on this winter with viruses and bacteria spreading at record levels, that it was all flying off the shelves at regular price.
[00:58:55.780 --> 00:59:01.467]  And so unlike other companies and other groups that do things like raise prices during a crisis,
[00:59:02.068 --> 00:59:10.678]  We're going to go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at EnforcedLife.com and EnforcedTour.com.
[00:59:11.159 --> 00:59:12.060]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:16.324]  We're going to go to 40% off because I just put a big order in.
[00:59:16.344 --> 00:59:22.271]  It'll be a few months till more comes in, but I want you to have the impetus and the initiative to get it for yourself and your family.
[00:59:23.052 --> 00:59:26.393]  Get a great discount, see how great it works, and become a repeat customer.
[00:59:26.653 --> 00:59:31.335]  It's just as a Texan, and as American, and as a patriot, that's how I want to be treated.
[00:59:31.835 --> 00:59:39.117]  That when there's a crisis, and people really need something and want it, I'm gonna sell it at a huge discount instead of selling it at full price because I noticed you were buying it.
[00:59:39.478 --> 00:59:50.001]  So because you're supporting us and already buying it, both the products, 40% off as a combo, or 40% off individually, while supplies last, at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:59:55.225 --> 01:00:01.167]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.353 --> 01:00:20.635]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.015 --> 01:00:23.576]  What does alien mean?
[01:00:24.346 --> 01:00:27.608]  We'll talk about it in the next segment.
[01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:56.639]  So think about that, and understand that globalists have all this hidden knowledge, a lot of it, and they're using it against humanity instead of using the knowledge to empower humanity.
[01:00:56.659 --> 01:01:00.080]  Some stages don't carry this five minutes, so this is the Bitcoin thing, next segment, Mike.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.801]  But Mike Adams, NaturalNews.com.
[01:01:01.821 --> 01:01:09.762]  I wanted to talk to you about, just in general, why the establishment seems like they're so incredibly panicked.
[01:01:09.802 --> 01:01:13.603]  Because this isn't just, oh, this is their time for their offensive.
[01:01:14.023 --> 01:01:18.664]  They're behind, they're pissed, and they've put the heat to all their minions.
[01:01:19.264 --> 01:01:24.387]  That you are going to carry out this operation and demoralize and break these people's will right now.
[01:01:24.927 --> 01:01:30.130]  And I think the enemy is in deep trouble and has basically cut loose all their backup forces.
[01:01:30.891 --> 01:01:36.194]  And if people don't bow to this and just stay the course, I think we're going to win some big developments.
[01:01:36.674 --> 01:01:39.296]  There's some folks that don't want this planet to go to the next level.
[01:01:39.336 --> 01:01:41.617]  But I mean, at a gut level, I say we're already winning.
[01:01:43.515 --> 01:01:56.161]  There has been a concerted, multi-vectored effort, as you know, you're well aware of this, to poison the minds of the people with chemicals, with fluoride in the water, with toxic pesticides in the food, with 5G cell towers and so on.
[01:01:56.181 --> 01:02:02.084]  But what's new to understand about this is it's not just about causing lobotomies like with the mercury in vaccines.
[01:02:02.384 --> 01:02:04.505]  It's in the flu shots given to children in California.
[01:02:04.845 --> 01:02:08.067]  I've got that on a letter from the Secretary of Health of California.
[01:02:08.567 --> 01:02:09.968]  They inject children with mercury.
[01:02:10.563 --> 01:02:12.344]  It's not just about the health implications, Alex.
[01:02:12.904 --> 01:02:22.447]  It's about making them spiritually vulnerable, and I know this is going to sound a little bit out there, but spiritually vulnerable to true demonic possession.
[01:02:22.968 --> 01:02:25.168]  Demonic influence, demonic possession.
[01:02:25.468 --> 01:02:29.030]  This is the biblical cosmic war that is taking place in our world today.
[01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:37.513]  When you see these leftists go insane over a bloodlust of murdering children and celebrating it, standing up and applauding it,
[01:02:38.013 --> 01:02:40.294]  That is not a human response.
[01:02:40.855 --> 01:02:42.936]  That is a demonic response.
[01:02:43.016 --> 01:02:49.900]  Some of these leftists, not all of them, but some of them are now literally consumed and controlled by demonic spirits.
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:03:02.747]  But getting there requires attacks on the human neurology, attacks on consciousness, attacks on the divinity, the divine spirit, the god-like spirit that is in every real human being.
[01:03:03.108 --> 01:03:03.628]  That's the war.
[01:03:03.648 --> 01:03:03.928]  That's key.
[01:03:03.988 --> 01:03:07.010]  We get infested and attacked because we are special.
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:17.625]  Well, that's right, but they have to create a weakness, and they use chemicals, and they use assaults on your neurology to make you vulnerable to a spiritual infection.
[01:03:17.645 --> 01:03:20.387]  And Hollywood knows this, so in every movie, it's like, oh, the golden child.
[01:03:20.627 --> 01:03:28.011]  The devil can't kill until we can give the blood of a baby they killed to the golden child, and corrupt the golden child, then we can kill him.
[01:03:29.322 --> 01:03:36.368]  And remember, too, that satanic and demonic forces, they market themselves, so to speak, as liberty to the youth.
[01:03:36.468 --> 01:03:43.533]  They say, you should be free to do anything you want without any boundaries, without any authority, without any overriding rules, no ethics, no morality.
[01:03:43.833 --> 01:03:44.514]  You are free!
[01:03:44.774 --> 01:03:45.795]  Here, join Satan!
[01:03:46.445 --> 01:03:51.591]  It's marketed as freedom, but it's actual enslavement to that demonic force.
[01:03:51.611 --> 01:03:53.032]  And that's why they didn't like Walt Disney.
[01:03:53.132 --> 01:03:55.975]  He wasn't perfect, but he was... Pinocchio!
[01:03:56.215 --> 01:04:00.320]  They gotta get the kids to be criminals first, then they lose their protection and become slaves.
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.382]  They become donkeys and are loaded on the slave ship.
[01:04:04.151 --> 01:04:04.812]  You're exactly right.
[01:04:04.872 --> 01:04:10.917]  So what we are actually facing, the battle of our realm right now, is not simply a political battle.
[01:04:11.158 --> 01:04:12.299]  It's not an economic battle.
[01:04:12.559 --> 01:04:14.160]  It's not even a battle of left versus right.
[01:04:14.621 --> 01:04:16.422]  It's a spiritual battle.
[01:04:16.503 --> 01:04:19.265]  It's an end times Book of Revelation battle.
[01:04:19.325 --> 01:04:19.886]  No, I agree.
[01:04:19.906 --> 01:04:22.488]  And why are these demons, they're so dumb.
[01:04:22.548 --> 01:04:25.331]  It's like, they're like Slimer, but they're able to conquer us.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.201]  Well, it's like zombies.
[01:04:27.441 --> 01:04:29.722]  You know, you can't reason with a zombie.
[01:04:30.002 --> 01:04:31.543]  You can't negotiate with a zombie.
[01:04:31.583 --> 01:04:34.165]  So, it's just like, you can't reason with liberals.
[01:04:34.205 --> 01:04:37.047]  You can give them all the facts in the world, and they reject them.
[01:04:37.067 --> 01:04:39.028]  Because it's an attack force broadcast.
[01:04:39.568 --> 01:04:43.050]  There's obviously a bigger intelligence behind it, but their armies seem like they're mindless.
[01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:44.611]  No, it's just they're single-minded.
[01:04:45.792 --> 01:04:52.016]  And those who have intelligence, and have wisdom, and have consciousness, break out of it eventually, if they get influenced by it.
[01:04:52.316 --> 01:04:53.857]  And they wake up, and that's what's happening.
[01:04:53.897 --> 01:04:55.138]  A mass awakening worldwide.
[01:04:57.432 --> 01:04:59.274]  Man, I tell you, this is the ultimate truth.
[01:04:59.294 --> 01:05:00.455]  This is what it is on this planet.
[01:05:00.475 --> 01:05:01.095]  It's the secret.
[01:05:01.136 --> 01:05:04.699]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:04.759 --> 01:05:11.365]  For those looking for the ultimate source of energy for their day, every day, the Brain Synergy Combo is here.

[01:06:27.658 --> 01:06:37.590]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:06:38.331 --> 01:06:40.834]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:40.854 --> 01:06:41.736]  Alright, coming up...
[01:06:42.918 --> 01:06:45.979]  I'm going to open the phones up right through to the end of the broadcast.
[01:06:45.999 --> 01:06:46.979]  Stuart Rose is going to pop in.
[01:06:47.019 --> 01:06:48.960]  He'll take your calls with me on the great State of the Union.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:50.500]  The clips, it's all coming up.
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.360]  What were the best parts?
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:52.160]  What were the worst parts?
[01:06:52.981 --> 01:06:54.241]  I should probably give the number out, though.
[01:06:54.281 --> 01:06:56.201]  About 30 minutes ago, I said, hey, we're going to open the phones up.
[01:06:56.221 --> 01:07:02.103]  I'm going to open the phones up specifically on what do you think the best parts of the State of the Union were versus the worst parts.
[01:07:02.703 --> 01:07:06.884]  And what do you just make of the Democrats openly becoming, shaking their heads like Trump.
[01:07:06.924 --> 01:07:08.484]  We don't want to kill babies after they're born.
[01:07:08.745 --> 01:07:10.245]  They're like, no, we do, we do.
[01:07:12.012 --> 01:07:14.093]  We've helped bus people that are child trafficking.
[01:07:14.234 --> 01:07:15.254]  Oh no, that's bad!
[01:07:15.274 --> 01:07:19.657]  I mean, they're just coming out in the open.
[01:07:19.677 --> 01:07:24.120]  But going back to Mike Adams of naturalnews.com, he's a programmer, he's a researcher, he's an author.
[01:07:25.401 --> 01:07:31.384]  He owns a big lab that does scanning of products, so he's a jack of many scientific trades.
[01:07:31.785 --> 01:07:32.885]  A renaissance man, you could say.
[01:07:33.886 --> 01:07:37.569]  And I wanted to just get his take on these articles.
[01:07:37.609 --> 01:07:40.592]  The dark side of Jack Dorsey's Bitcoin push on Joe Rogan.
[01:07:40.832 --> 01:07:41.873]  People at first were like, really?
[01:07:41.893 --> 01:07:43.934]  They're involved in SEC violations?
[01:07:43.974 --> 01:07:55.424]  Well, when you don't tell somebody your main sponsor is something, and then the fact that they're trying to make Bitcoin the main operating system of it, and then you don't tell people when you're telling them to invest in it, that's very unethical.
[01:07:56.877 --> 01:07:57.377]  At any level.
[01:07:57.657 --> 01:08:01.099]  So the number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:01.439]  877-789-2539.
[01:08:01.459 --> 01:08:02.100]  877-789-2539.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:10.504]  And we will take your phone calls.
[01:08:10.524 --> 01:08:15.187]  But Mike, getting into this, obviously I'm not against cryptocurrencies.
[01:08:15.707 --> 01:08:16.988]  I understand the Federal Reserve is fiat.
[01:08:17.308 --> 01:08:20.870]  I'd like to have a thousand different currencies and whatever we choose is the best and that becomes dominant.
[01:08:21.290 --> 01:08:23.651]  But I want five or six big ones, a hundred big ones, whatever.
[01:08:24.172 --> 01:08:24.852]  Here's Jack Dorsey.
[01:08:24.872 --> 01:08:26.233]  We want a planetary currency.
[01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:29.807]  It's going to be run by Twitter.
[01:08:30.507 --> 01:08:33.329]  Twitter's going to face scan you to be able to communicate with people.
[01:08:34.650 --> 01:08:37.252]  And then we're going to have our moderators, who you can't talk bad about Bitcoin.
[01:08:37.272 --> 01:08:38.353]  He's already done all this.
[01:08:38.773 --> 01:08:43.637]  And then there's Joe going, oh, how wonderful, not telling anybody what they're watching.
[01:08:43.657 --> 01:08:45.979]  This was a sickening pump and dump.
[01:08:46.059 --> 01:08:48.520]  I mean, if you look at Jack Dorsey, he dumped Bitcoin.
[01:08:49.511 --> 01:08:50.792]  Right when it started to go down.
[01:08:51.392 --> 01:08:52.112]  That's insider trading.
[01:08:52.432 --> 01:08:54.773]  So now, is he wanting a dead cat bounce?
[01:08:54.853 --> 01:08:55.874]  A second group of suckers?
[01:08:56.414 --> 01:08:59.555]  Or is it because his platform, Square Cash, is based on it?
[01:09:00.096 --> 01:09:02.857]  I mean, obviously he says he wants it to be the global currency.
[01:09:03.557 --> 01:09:05.538]  So it sounds like some lofty visions he's got.
[01:09:06.018 --> 01:09:07.319]  Who do you really think Jack Dorsey is?
[01:09:08.479 --> 01:09:15.422]  Like you, Alex, I am opposed to central bank control over the money supply, and I'm pro-crypto theory.
[01:09:15.722 --> 01:09:18.243]  I like the idea of a decentralized money supply.
[01:09:18.283 --> 01:09:31.989]  However, my research has led me to conclude, and remember, I started warning about Bitcoin a year and a half ago and took a lot of heat for that, but my research leads me to understand that Bitcoin is a creation of the deep state.
[01:09:32.529 --> 01:09:43.235]  Bitcoin is used to launder money and to move money surreptitiously so that deep state operatives can bribe, pay off, and fund specific targets.
[01:09:44.155 --> 01:09:57.943]  For example, my research and certain sources I have that I can't name yet tell me that in fact the Mexican drug cartels are paying off Democrats to oppose a wall in Bitcoin.
[01:09:58.507 --> 01:10:04.235]  And see, Bitcoin allows the movement of money, but it requires a critical mass of public participation in order to provide cover.
[01:10:04.755 --> 01:10:12.906]  So you have to get a lot of people involved in order for Bitcoin to have value and fluidity, where someone can trade Bitcoin for something else, such as gold or cash.
[01:10:13.467 --> 01:10:29.771]  So, according to my research, certain key Democrats are taking Bitcoin, and then they're using it, they're trading it, for gold or other precious metals, which can then be held and kept anonymously, and at a future date sold off anonymously, without creating any traceable transactions.
[01:10:30.072 --> 01:10:35.013]  But at the same time, Alex, and this is key, this is how they were trying to trap you with Bitcoin,
[01:10:35.613 --> 01:10:41.098]  What they can do is they can selectively prosecute people for engaging in pump-and-dump schemes.
[01:10:41.678 --> 01:10:53.448]  Anybody who promoted Bitcoin that is on the target list can be said to have been involved in a fraud or a scam or financial losses when Bitcoin went from $20,000 down to $3,500.
[01:10:55.730 --> 01:11:00.554]  Meanwhile, the globalists never get prosecuted because all prosecutions are selective.
[01:11:01.092 --> 01:11:04.435]  So I gotta say, Alex, you dodged a huge bullet.
[01:11:04.735 --> 01:11:08.619]  I think that they would have you in jail right now if you had been pumping Bitcoin.
[01:11:08.939 --> 01:11:13.143]  They would have arrested you, and they would have charged you with financial fraud.
[01:11:13.363 --> 01:11:26.715]  But yet, people like Rogan and Jack Dorsey and others can do the exact same thing, but because they're part of the protected class of the Deep State insiders who continue to pump these things, they are never prosecuted, just like Hillary Clinton is never prosecuted.
[01:11:26.995 --> 01:11:28.056]  That's my summary of it, Alex.
[01:11:30.009 --> 01:11:30.469]  Powerful.
[01:11:30.529 --> 01:11:31.070]  Elaborate.
[01:11:32.811 --> 01:11:38.635]  Well, so where this is going is, of course, total government control over every transaction.
[01:11:39.235 --> 01:11:47.461]  When you use a cryptocurrency that's controlled by the NSA, and by the way, the NSA wrote the original encryption algorithm for Bitcoin.
[01:11:47.761 --> 01:11:52.625]  There's no doubt in my mind that there's a backdoor into Bitcoin, and the risks are enormous.
[01:11:52.685 --> 01:11:54.746]  Well, that's what the blockchain is.
[01:11:54.846 --> 01:11:57.328]  It's finally a way to track all transactions.
[01:11:58.274 --> 01:12:04.778]  Yeah, well it's a shared online spreadsheet where every transaction is tracked by every person who is participating in it.
[01:12:05.298 --> 01:12:08.520]  You know they've got an editing tool where they can plant stuff.
[01:12:10.797 --> 01:12:13.498]  Look, I have no doubt they've got back doors built into Bitcoin.
[01:12:13.858 --> 01:12:18.600]  But they're still trying to push it because this is the way to sucker everybody in while they pump and dump.
[01:12:18.641 --> 01:12:23.022]  They keep whiplashing the market and just taking money from people.
[01:12:23.323 --> 01:12:24.423]  But where is this money going?
[01:12:24.463 --> 01:12:26.944]  See, remember Gary Webb, the journalist?
[01:12:26.984 --> 01:12:37.429]  He was murdered by the CIA for exposing the financial line to, was it the cocaine trade or the heroin trade?
[01:12:37.449 --> 01:12:38.909]  It was cocaine, yeah.
[01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:40.070]  It was cocaine.
[01:12:40.962 --> 01:12:42.003]  Now that's what they used to do.
[01:12:42.023 --> 01:12:45.827]  They used to move cocaine to raise money for the CIA.
[01:12:45.867 --> 01:12:46.968]  That was their black money.
[01:12:47.028 --> 01:12:48.009]  That was their secret money.
[01:12:48.449 --> 01:12:49.270]  And now it's Bitcoin.
[01:12:50.211 --> 01:12:50.911]  Now it's Bitcoin.
[01:12:50.931 --> 01:12:51.412]  See, that's it.
[01:12:51.552 --> 01:12:52.312]  Used to be cocaine.
[01:12:52.733 --> 01:12:53.454]  Now it's Bitcoin.
[01:12:53.474 --> 01:12:57.397]  So they have to keep Bitcoin alive so they can continue to use it.
[01:12:57.617 --> 01:12:59.179]  So the dead cat bounces.
[01:12:59.579 --> 01:13:03.623]  They're bringing in more suckers to keep it on life support so they can keep running money through it.
[01:13:04.491 --> 01:13:12.738]  That's right, and ultimately the people who are pushing Bitcoin now, they don't care about the Federal Reserve, they don't care about Liberty, they don't care about decentralization, the big ones I'm talking about.
[01:13:13.618 --> 01:13:20.124]  What they care about is having a money laundering and money funneling system so they can continue to fund their deep state operations.
[01:13:20.184 --> 01:13:29.351]  And it shows that Bitcoin has always been controlled, because you have all these other cryptocurrencies and Jack Dorsey's like, no, it will be the one, it's the only one, and we don't care if it's popular or other ones, we use this one.
[01:13:31.002 --> 01:13:32.784]  And the tech giants are merging with the deep state.
[01:13:32.804 --> 01:13:33.685]  I mean, it's already happened.
[01:13:34.065 --> 01:13:38.590]  So you look at Twitter, Google, Facebook, they are now an extension of the deep state.
[01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:41.312]  And they are one and the same at this point.
[01:13:41.332 --> 01:13:43.674]  So of course they're going to try to... They always were, Mike.
[01:13:43.734 --> 01:13:45.997]  That's what I'm saying, is we forced their uncloaking.
[01:13:46.537 --> 01:13:48.159]  I think they're doing all this out of a panic.
[01:13:49.762 --> 01:13:50.663]  Well, absolutely!
[01:13:50.723 --> 01:14:04.789]  The same way that they are censoring you and me and everybody else who's speaking out about this, they have to control all speech, all thoughts, all history, like Orwellian style, and they have to control every transaction, the entire money supply.
[01:14:05.169 --> 01:14:11.151]  And this is how they can commit also economic sabotage, because if they can track you, they can also shut you off.
[01:14:11.451 --> 01:14:17.074]  They can say, you can't participate in this cryptocurrency system because you said something about it.
[01:14:17.614 --> 01:14:18.695]  You're banned for life.
[01:14:18.975 --> 01:14:23.518]  Well, that's what the article says, the dark side of Jack Dorsey's Bitcoin push on Joe Rogan.
[01:14:23.558 --> 01:14:31.604]  It's like, the way they censored on Reddit and everywhere else when Bitcoin tried to stay dominant, they're like, oh my God, they're now going to be in your finances.
[01:14:31.704 --> 01:14:37.489]  Actual leftist censors are going to be involved with your whole financial history right in front of you.
[01:14:38.129 --> 01:14:39.710]  Again, it's all about robbing privacy.
[01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:42.712]  Everything they've done is about that, with the cell phones and all of it.
[01:14:43.633 --> 01:14:44.574]  Yeah, and there's no doubt.
[01:14:45.783 --> 01:14:50.968]  It's obvious Joe Rogan has signed up to be one of the front men for the deep state.
[01:14:51.508 --> 01:14:51.929]  No doubt.
[01:14:52.349 --> 01:14:53.430]  He is in with them.
[01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:55.872]  He has always been a conformist with Hollywood.
[01:14:55.932 --> 01:15:02.999]  He's always wanted to get popular and have influence no matter what kind of ethics or morals were required to get there.
[01:15:03.379 --> 01:15:08.283]  And frankly, you know, that's his decision, but that's not my decision and that's not your decision.
[01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:10.305]  We operate with morals and ethics.
[01:15:10.545 --> 01:15:12.047]  He called me last night.
[01:15:12.247 --> 01:15:15.932]  I didn't take the call, but I heard from his friends that were calling me this morning what it was about.
[01:15:15.952 --> 01:15:16.693]  He's like, please stop.
[01:15:17.114 --> 01:15:18.956]  Dude, I don't want to go out against you.
[01:15:19.016 --> 01:15:20.859]  You've now joined the dark side.
[01:15:20.879 --> 01:15:22.421]  You've now enlisted completely.
[01:15:23.102 --> 01:15:24.604]  And so you become a target.
[01:15:24.624 --> 01:15:26.026]  I mean, I don't know what he thinks I do.
[01:15:26.046 --> 01:15:27.909]  Like, this is not a game here.
[01:15:27.969 --> 01:15:28.890]  This is what we do.
[01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:29.150]  Right.
[01:15:29.731 --> 01:15:29.911]  Right.
[01:15:30.231 --> 01:15:32.512]  Look, they should know by now they can't turn you.
[01:15:32.973 --> 01:15:33.733]  They can't turn me.
[01:15:34.073 --> 01:15:36.114]  There are others like us who stand firm.
[01:15:36.574 --> 01:15:38.095]  And we are all in, man.
[01:15:38.335 --> 01:15:42.297]  This is not just our lives are in, our souls are in this fight.
[01:15:42.657 --> 01:15:43.718]  We fight for humanity.
[01:15:43.898 --> 01:15:44.438]  End of story.
[01:15:44.878 --> 01:15:45.278]  Not negotiable.
[01:15:45.298 --> 01:15:46.719]  Exactly, and they think they're scaring us.
[01:15:46.879 --> 01:15:48.459]  I'm scared of not being with God.
[01:15:48.479 --> 01:15:50.440]  They cannot scare us.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.601]  I've seen who they are.
[01:15:52.041 --> 01:15:56.202]  I'm like hanging on the helicopter skids in the fall of Saigon.
[01:15:56.262 --> 01:15:57.103]  God, take me with you.
[01:15:57.123 --> 01:15:58.703]  I think I'm worried about these people.
[01:15:59.003 --> 01:15:59.904]  Mike Adams, great job.
[01:16:00.344 --> 01:16:01.204]  We'll be right with calls.
[01:16:01.344 --> 01:16:01.604]  Thank you.
[01:16:02.705 --> 01:16:03.165]  Maybe not.
[01:16:03.565 --> 01:16:05.246]  It took us over a year to develop it.
[01:16:06.006 --> 01:16:07.967]  Thousands and thousands of five-star reviews.
[01:16:09.099 --> 01:16:10.100]  It's BrainForce Plus.
[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:15.424]  I'm so proud of you and the InfoWars team for all that you do.
[01:16:15.524 --> 01:16:17.166]  I wanted to say I love your products.
[01:16:17.386 --> 01:16:19.708]  The BrainForce Plus is amazing.
[01:16:19.728 --> 01:16:24.972]  Me and my family take it every day and I mean you really can feel what it does.
[01:16:24.992 --> 01:16:33.239]  We were able to develop BrainForce because we went out and looked at what the best-selling nootropics or brain-focused energy products were.
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:35.681]  And we decided to make it even stronger
[01:16:36.662 --> 01:16:40.443]  And even more high quality and even more organic than leading competitors.
[01:16:41.003 --> 01:16:42.864]  And we've done it with Brain Force Plus.
[01:16:42.944 --> 01:16:47.065]  It is our number one bestseller in gross bottles sold.
[01:16:47.986 --> 01:16:52.347]  Now I made the decision in our marketing to put a lot of product in it and sell it for a low price.
[01:16:52.987 --> 01:17:00.409]  Believing that you're smart, you'll research the market, get a great result, know you're getting a great deal, and be routine, continued customers.
[01:17:00.789 --> 01:17:04.331]  I want a long-term relationship with you, and I want a product that I'm proud of that I'm going to use.
[01:17:04.771 --> 01:17:06.011]  It's up there as the very best.
[01:17:06.311 --> 01:17:08.952]  There are nootropics that are $80 a bottle that aren't as good.
[01:17:09.292 --> 01:17:10.432]  They have some dissimilar ingredients.
[01:17:11.073 --> 01:17:14.054]  But, you know, a doctor sells it at their office, so it must be better.
[01:17:15.194 --> 01:17:21.776]  Ladies and gentlemen, we then stood back and said, what is the number one best-selling thing in the total market globally?
[01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.970]  I don't
[01:17:43.257 --> 01:17:49.323]  Top people in the country who has developed some of the other top energy drinks in the nation and in the world.
[01:17:49.743 --> 01:17:53.507]  And they developed TurboForce that is the next level.
[01:17:54.047 --> 01:17:54.968]  Long burn.
[01:17:54.988 --> 01:17:57.210]  A lot of folks up to 10 hours of energy.
[01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:58.311]  Me, 6, 7, 8 hours.
[01:17:58.692 --> 01:17:59.693]  And I take about a half a packet.
[01:17:59.713 --> 01:18:00.233]  It's so strong.
[01:18:00.573 --> 01:18:06.179]  And then it's got all the minerals and all the different amino acids that help deliver the energy into the body.
[01:18:06.909 --> 01:18:20.733]  And that's why I want to thank all the listeners who've been BrainForce fans with 50% off BrainForce, because the two go together to supply yourself and your family with your nootropic with TurboForce, ladies and gentlemen, so you can try it.
[01:18:21.333 --> 01:18:27.955]  It's 33% off, and you get it in the combo, 50% off on BrainForce for a limited time at Inforestore.com.
[01:18:28.415 --> 01:18:31.016]  One is a pill, one is a packet.
[01:18:31.516 --> 01:18:35.837]  And again, the first time you take TurboForce, I recommend you only take half a packet, because let me tell you,
[01:18:36.846 --> 01:18:40.270]  Folks I know that are totally into energy drinks said they've never seen anything like it.
[01:18:40.651 --> 01:18:42.172]  Most energy drinks hit in 20-30 minutes.
[01:18:42.192 --> 01:18:46.317]  A lot of people get hit in 5 minutes with turbo force.
[01:18:46.798 --> 01:18:51.723]  But again, it doesn't just hit fast, it lasts super, super long because the developers
[01:18:52.830 --> 01:19:00.620]  That we reached out to had the mission of having something that gives you continual clean energy over a long period of time.
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:06.167]  So the different compounds that are in this, that synergistically work together, have different burn rates.
[01:19:06.727 --> 01:19:10.092]  Almost like a Saturn rocket's got three different components.
[01:19:11.579 --> 01:19:12.040]  See what I mean?
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:20.249]  It launches, you get the main boost phase, then you get up into orbit, you get your next phase, you get to the moon, land on the moon, come back to the Earth.
[01:19:20.629 --> 01:19:24.433]  You've got all those different phases here, ladies and gentlemen, to get you throughout the day.
[01:19:24.854 --> 01:19:25.674]  Boost in the morning!
[01:19:26.618 --> 01:19:31.839]  Continue on through your interstellar day, conquering, exploring, dominating.
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.700]  And listen, I like to ride my horse and shoot my gun.
[01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:37.681]  You know, a country boy's work is really never done.
[01:19:37.701 --> 01:19:45.323]  And after you put the kids down to bed with the missus there in your arms, you can do a repair job and fix the cable like all good Americans do.
[01:19:45.863 --> 01:19:46.863]  And all thanks to TurboForce.
[01:19:47.564 --> 01:19:52.145]  So again, coming to you, ladies and gentlemen, from the founding system
[01:19:52.945 --> 01:19:57.187]  Of turbo force and brain force, I bring you this incredible product, the M4WarsLive.com.
[01:19:57.407 --> 01:19:58.887]  Get the energy combo today.
[01:19:59.167 --> 01:20:00.728]  Oh, and fund the M4 war and change the world.
[01:20:00.928 --> 01:20:01.728]  I forgot about that part too.
[01:20:05.950 --> 01:20:08.591]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:20.170 --> 01:20:26.052]  Alright, I made the joke earlier, Joe Rogan was on the show, and I'm getting really tired of talking about it.
[01:20:26.272 --> 01:20:35.835]  It becomes a key window into global government, cashless societies, how they manipulate people, what the system thinks is a successful weapons system against humanity.
[01:20:36.175 --> 01:20:46.118]  So for that reason, I have pledged to do a detailed, vivisection on Joe Rogan, politically.
[01:20:49.372 --> 01:20:50.213]  A dissection.
[01:20:50.993 --> 01:20:52.474]  So that will be happening.
[01:20:52.494 --> 01:20:55.036]  We're going to go to your phone calls here in just a moment.
[01:20:56.137 --> 01:20:58.119]  But I should start getting into this great State of the Union.
[01:20:58.799 --> 01:21:00.040]  And I'm not just cheerleading for Trump.
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:01.221]  There's a lot Trump's doing.
[01:21:01.662 --> 01:21:03.803]  Like his new NAFTA deal he claims is great.
[01:21:04.264 --> 01:21:06.445]  It gives all the tech giants the right to censor whoever they want.
[01:21:06.505 --> 01:21:08.147]  So that'll be fought in Congress.
[01:21:09.227 --> 01:21:10.348]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:21:10.508 --> 01:21:13.511]  You're now a hero if you say we shouldn't kill babies after they're born.
[01:21:15.896 --> 01:21:22.222]  I mean, one day if the system has its way, they'll say, birth is when we eat a baby, or birth is when we hang them up by their toes.
[01:21:22.242 --> 01:21:29.129]  You know, it's like, conspiracy theorists claim that once there were things called mothers, but now we grow the hams in tanks and eat them.
[01:21:31.191 --> 01:21:33.053]  Did we always have little fork tails?
[01:21:33.453 --> 01:21:34.274]  Yes, you always did.
[01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:36.304]  After the mutation?
[01:21:36.824 --> 01:21:40.066]  I mean, it's just... And of course, that sounds insane.
[01:21:40.086 --> 01:21:40.647]  That's what I mean.
[01:21:40.687 --> 01:21:43.609]  It's just the mental illness of the knowledge of evil.
[01:21:44.109 --> 01:21:45.150]  We have the knowledge of good already.
[01:21:45.190 --> 01:21:46.431]  The knowledge of evil is like cancer.
[01:21:46.471 --> 01:21:47.732]  It's like the knowledge of going crazy.
[01:21:49.493 --> 01:21:52.215]  And so it looks schizophrenic because they're schizophrenic.
[01:21:52.875 --> 01:21:53.796]  It's crazy people.
[01:21:55.157 --> 01:21:57.759]  And then we say, hey, don't sexualize kids.
[01:21:58.119 --> 01:21:58.639]  Don't do all this.
[01:21:58.659 --> 01:21:59.860]  They go, hey, we're going to do it.
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:00.781]  Go away, crazy man.
[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:09.724]  They tell you you're crazy for doing the opposite of what they're doing and all you're doing is covering how they're crazy.
[01:22:10.044 --> 01:22:19.069]  That clip's actually coming up next segment but here is President Trump because that's what the doctors said and that's what they do in places all over the country.
[01:22:19.349 --> 01:22:22.691]  The laws haven't been passed because all the lawsuits and things that are happening.
[01:22:23.051 --> 01:22:29.415]  Planned Parenthood's lobbying to get it legalized to keep babies alive after birth because it's what they're doing, selling the organs.
[01:22:31.516 --> 01:22:32.517]  That's why they're so desperate.
[01:22:32.557 --> 01:22:38.583]  Like, God Almighty, we've been harvesting a ton of these kids, and people are gonna find out, and the mothers are gonna find out how much money they could've got.
[01:22:38.943 --> 01:22:44.049]  Even their psychotics like us, that they could've gotten hundreds of thousands of dollars for these, for these livers and other goodies.
[01:22:44.529 --> 01:22:45.830]  Other giblets.
[01:22:47.612 --> 01:22:50.255]  Other little, uh, giblets.
[01:22:51.912 --> 01:22:52.553]  It's so sick.
[01:22:53.093 --> 01:22:54.254]  Then they're trying to normalize it.
[01:22:54.294 --> 01:22:55.975]  Yeah, we can make them comfortable.
[01:22:56.356 --> 01:22:58.137]  Kill them after they're born.
[01:22:58.658 --> 01:23:01.340]  I'm a fine southern gentleman though.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.281]  So it's alright.
[01:23:05.323 --> 01:23:06.444]  And then I'm the bad guy.
[01:23:06.985 --> 01:23:08.105]  In fact, later I'll get to this.
[01:23:08.146 --> 01:23:08.846]  I saw it this morning.
[01:23:08.886 --> 01:23:09.907]  I said to the crew.
[01:23:10.888 --> 01:23:11.809]  It's the Joe Rogan stuff.
[01:23:11.829 --> 01:23:15.131]  He's like, Jones is in a bad place.
[01:23:16.352 --> 01:23:16.953]  He plays a clip.
[01:23:18.106 --> 01:23:24.973]  Jimmy Savelle kidnapped children and tortured them to death in dungeons and had group satanic sex parties at morgues with the bodies.
[01:23:25.373 --> 01:23:28.837]  That's BBC reporting where he worked.
[01:23:29.057 --> 01:23:32.701]  Joe, I know it's crazy to have sex with dead kids at morgues.
[01:23:33.502 --> 01:23:34.042]  It happened.
[01:23:34.122 --> 01:23:34.763]  It's admitted.
[01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:38.927]  Let's see.
[01:23:39.568 --> 01:23:41.049]  Joe Rogan can't handle that.
[01:23:41.826 --> 01:23:47.750]  He just goes, Jones is crazy, instead of typing in, Jimmy Savelle, secret dungeon discovered.
[01:23:48.071 --> 01:23:51.453]  Jimmy Savelle, sex with dead kids at morgues.
[01:23:52.094 --> 01:23:53.314]  It's confirmed.
[01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:54.695]  It's admitted.
[01:23:55.076 --> 01:23:57.217]  It's a giant British pedophile network.
[01:23:57.698 --> 01:24:00.400]  Dead kids dug up on the estates.
[01:24:02.321 --> 01:24:04.783]  In fact, can we search into Jimmy Savelle since I said it?
[01:24:04.803 --> 01:24:08.826]  Just type in Jimmy Savelle, and if he isn't
[01:24:10.137 --> 01:24:14.138]  The spitting image of what, if I went to hell, I would expect to see at Hell's Gates.
[01:24:14.298 --> 01:24:15.019]  Or I'll type it in the phone.
[01:24:15.059 --> 01:24:15.539]  Here, we can't do it.
[01:24:15.559 --> 01:24:17.619]  There he is.
[01:24:17.639 --> 01:24:23.001]  Now, folks, that's a guy that procured children for prime ministers and others.
[01:24:25.102 --> 01:24:28.743]  And man, they even later confirmed, like one prime minister, they laid plastic out.
[01:24:28.783 --> 01:24:32.464]  His favorite thing was little brunette girls with blue eyes.
[01:24:32.604 --> 01:24:34.205]  Very expensive, very hard to kidnap.
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:49.248]  But, they'd lead him in with the plastic on the floor, and then Savelle would slit their throat ear to ear, and then the Prime Minister would masturbate over the dead body.
[01:24:49.929 --> 01:24:51.610]  Now, you know, I'm sorry.
[01:24:51.630 --> 01:24:52.050]  Oh, there it is!
[01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:53.231]  Oh, that's Main Street News!
[01:24:53.311 --> 01:24:54.091]  I'm sorry, Joe Rogan.
[01:24:54.491 --> 01:24:56.973]  See, Joe's like, can you believe the sickness of Jones?
[01:24:57.333 --> 01:24:58.774]  Put it back up for TV viewers.
[01:24:59.454 --> 01:25:00.115]  Yeah, yeah, zoom it out.
[01:25:00.555 --> 01:25:01.816]  That's, what is that, London Telegraph?
[01:25:01.836 --> 01:25:02.276]  BBC.
[01:25:02.856 --> 01:25:03.377]  Pack it up, please.
[01:25:04.403 --> 01:25:11.595]  How BBC star Jimmy Savelle allegedly got away with abusing 500 children and sex with dead bodies.
[01:25:12.737 --> 01:25:13.459]  So, Joe!
[01:25:14.681 --> 01:25:16.203]  You said I was in a bad place!
[01:25:17.563 --> 01:25:18.744]  I am in a bad place, man.
[01:25:18.764 --> 01:25:20.385]  I actually know what's going on.
[01:25:20.445 --> 01:25:21.126]  I want it to stop.
[01:25:21.146 --> 01:25:24.488]  I'm not some candy ass out in L.A.
[01:25:24.708 --> 01:25:28.411]  trying to act cool, saying Alex Jones has defamed Bill Maher.
[01:25:29.132 --> 01:25:36.397]  Bill Maher makes jokes about how 12-year-olds having sex with 35-year-olds is okay, and the name of his production company is Kid Love.
[01:25:36.737 --> 01:25:38.419]  That is the slogan of Nambla.
[01:25:43.403 --> 01:25:43.603]  See?
[01:25:44.343 --> 01:25:45.204]  See how that works, JoJo?
[01:25:47.685 --> 01:25:48.626]  See how that works, JoJo?
[01:25:49.687 --> 01:25:50.147]  JoJo?
[01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:53.210]  Joe the Snake Rogan?
[01:25:56.173 --> 01:26:06.684]  Yeah, John of God, faith healer, kept teenagers as sex slaves and sold their babies for up to 40,000 pounds before shipping them from Brazil to Europe.
[01:26:07.024 --> 01:26:09.046]  And what do you think happened to the babies in Europe?
[01:26:15.345 --> 01:26:16.485]  Let's just say it's not pretty.
[01:26:16.665 --> 01:26:17.245]  A lot of stuff.
[01:26:17.265 --> 01:26:18.326]  A lot of them are kept alive.
[01:26:18.366 --> 01:26:20.386]  Their blood's bled off by vampires' strength.
[01:26:21.726 --> 01:26:23.527]  These vampires don't actually live forever, though.
[01:26:26.888 --> 01:26:29.448]  So, yeah, I'm not for blood-drinking kids.
[01:26:29.608 --> 01:26:30.509]  I just, here's the deal.
[01:26:31.249 --> 01:26:34.930]  Joe Rogan's on blood-drink, kill-kid blood-drinking team.
[01:26:35.010 --> 01:26:41.071]  I mean, he's doing it, but you signed up with Jack Dorsey, a flaming demon-lying psychopath.
[01:26:43.516 --> 01:26:48.698]  So you understand, Joe, it's my duty to come after you.
[01:26:48.798 --> 01:26:54.380]  And then once it's my duty, I admit, I kind of get a little fired up and it's not becoming of me.
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:57.661]  But I don't like destroying people, even if they're evil.
[01:26:57.781 --> 01:27:01.543]  So I, it's, you know, God made us, the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[01:27:02.847 --> 01:27:05.368]  Let's just say I'm not into raping and torturing little kids.
[01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:09.691]  I am into going after people that are involved in it.
[01:27:09.991 --> 01:27:19.737]  And when I get my hands on you, when I get my hands around your neck, and all of your fake so-called male prowess, you will understand.
[01:27:19.757 --> 01:27:21.018]  And you will know.
[01:27:21.038 --> 01:27:27.321]  So you think I like the fact that I know they're murdering kids right now and sucking their frickin' blood?
[01:27:27.341 --> 01:27:29.983]  And then you won't man up and say it's wrong?
[01:27:31.069 --> 01:27:38.473]  Joe Rogan, you've got one last chance to get down on your knees to the Holy Spirit and ask Jesus Christ to cleanse you, because I don't believe you don't know all the stuff.
[01:27:38.493 --> 01:27:39.034]  You're smart.
[01:27:39.634 --> 01:27:42.035]  When I was on your show, you knew everything I knew and more.
[01:27:42.336 --> 01:27:46.818]  I've known you 21 years, and you're smart, but you're a devil.
[01:27:47.779 --> 01:27:49.120]  And your old logo was a devil.
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:50.340]  A space alien.
[01:27:50.641 --> 01:27:52.702]  A space gray with a devil on the other side.
[01:27:52.722 --> 01:27:57.585]  Can I tell you, the devil is the... Joe, look, we already know
[01:27:58.385 --> 01:28:03.769]  But Christ always offers that last chance.
[01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:05.490]  You understand?
[01:28:06.371 --> 01:28:12.235]  Let me tell you, I wouldn't want to get between God and what people have done to the children.
[01:28:13.856 --> 01:28:15.477]  Now look up his old logo from his old website.
[01:28:15.498 --> 01:28:15.898]  He shut off.
[01:28:15.938 --> 01:28:17.699]  It was it was a half of it here.
[01:28:17.739 --> 01:28:19.000]  I'll show you.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:22.823]  It was like a gray alien on one side.
[01:28:26.269 --> 01:28:27.250]  So you think they're gonna get all our kids?
[01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:27.390]  Nein!
[01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:27.530]  Nein!
[01:28:42.682 --> 01:28:44.984]  And all we've got to do is set our will against these people.
[01:28:45.044 --> 01:28:46.065]  You set your will.
[01:28:46.085 --> 01:28:46.825]  That's what we're scared of.
[01:28:46.845 --> 01:28:49.007]  Your will is trillions of times more powerful than theirs.
[01:28:49.547 --> 01:28:50.248]  Set your will.
[01:28:50.348 --> 01:28:50.708]  Commit.
[01:28:50.728 --> 01:28:51.429]  Stop being afraid.
[01:28:51.449 --> 01:28:53.490]  And then all of a sudden, God pours in.
[01:28:54.691 --> 01:28:56.293]  And then, then you know.
[01:28:57.093 --> 01:28:57.734]  Open the gate.
[01:28:58.234 --> 01:28:59.255]  Bring Christ in.
[01:29:02.677 --> 01:29:02.958]  Hi.
[01:29:04.979 --> 01:29:06.981]  I don't believe the globalists are that smart.
[01:29:10.283 --> 01:29:21.710]  I don't believe you're that stupid that we have this information and that if they shut me down, it's shut down when these pieces of crap are executing this information in front of everybody.
[01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:27.273]  Do you know why there have been layoffs at more than 20 major leftist fake news publications?
[01:29:27.433 --> 01:29:29.735]  From BuzzFeed to Newsweek to Vice.
[01:29:29.935 --> 01:29:31.135]  Why did it all happen this week?
[01:29:31.216 --> 01:29:33.877]  Why didn't it happen a month ago or a month from now?
[01:29:34.017 --> 01:29:35.538]  Why wasn't it doled out?
[01:29:35.718 --> 01:29:37.819]  Because it's concerted.
[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:44.242]  It's like a bombing run with a group of bombers flying in and they've all got targets.
[01:29:44.722 --> 01:29:47.222]  And they're all commanded by their HQ.
[01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:49.403]  And by the way, I don't just think that.
[01:29:49.723 --> 01:29:50.783]  I have their blueprint.
[01:29:50.963 --> 01:29:52.164]  I have their bombing run.
[01:29:52.244 --> 01:29:53.624]  I have their attack profile.
[01:29:53.904 --> 01:29:55.345]  I have their Achilles.
[01:29:56.105 --> 01:29:58.986]  And I'm here telling you their Achilles.
[01:29:59.686 --> 01:30:01.526]  I'm here telling you how to defeat them.
[01:30:01.967 --> 01:30:03.687]  Real intelligence is observation.
[01:30:04.827 --> 01:30:06.388]  Real intelligence is infiltration.
[01:30:07.395 --> 01:30:12.438]  Real intelligence is interfacing banging heads with your enemy.
[01:30:13.279 --> 01:30:18.382]  Because you begin to know your enemy better than the enemy
[01:30:20.389 --> 01:30:24.051]  All real warfare that's victorious is psychic.
[01:30:24.191 --> 01:30:30.313]  It can be physical, but that's only to draw out the essence of the enemy's goals and their fears.
[01:30:30.593 --> 01:30:36.075]  And then the commitment to meet your enemy with your goals and your love, love trumps all.
[01:30:36.195 --> 01:30:40.797]  But you have to realistically have the template of victory to be able to take it on.
[01:30:41.557 --> 01:30:54.123]  You can't counter a civilizational ending event, a planned viral demolition of humanity, a earth-ending termination of the birth of a new species, a new vision, a new world.
[01:30:54.343 --> 01:30:57.985]  You can't counter something like that with lack of vision.
[01:30:58.125 --> 01:30:59.806]  Simply countering their program.
[01:30:59.886 --> 01:31:07.329]  You must offer the world that you see and see if others believe in that world and see how they will then offer information that
[01:31:07.369 --> 01:31:11.231]  You have to recruit in a war.
[01:31:11.431 --> 01:31:16.234]  And to do that, you need to look for people that aren't just trying to be in charge of something.
[01:31:16.274 --> 01:31:19.395]  You need to look for people that want to be involved in something.
[01:31:19.535 --> 01:31:21.296]  Involved in something bigger than them.
[01:31:21.556 --> 01:31:24.338]  Not because they want to rule people, but because they love people.
[01:31:24.418 --> 01:31:31.222]  Because they love their ancestors, and they love humanity, and they have a vision that they want to add to in the future.
[01:31:32.722 --> 01:31:35.744]  So that all the victories and the successes of our progeny
[01:31:36.766 --> 01:31:55.322]  When we're the ancestors, when we're long gone, we live on through those people in the future and the incredible challenges they face, and the struggles, and the love, and the passion, and the will, as we become stronger, and stronger, and stronger, but then face greater and greater obstacles as the propulsion system of the future.
[01:31:56.223 --> 01:32:03.565]  That's why these Satanists fear me so much, because they've bet on this planet, and they've bet on their takeover, and they think they're victorious.
[01:32:03.605 --> 01:32:09.627]  And that's why I hate to plug products and the things we sell, but everything we sell is good.
[01:32:10.187 --> 01:32:12.547]  It's the best there is at the price it's at.
[01:32:13.308 --> 01:32:21.610]  And it funds what we're doing that's so fundamentally radical against the spirit of this world that it shakes the enemies of humanity to their very core.
[01:32:22.170 --> 01:32:24.351]  And that's why I know we're gonna win in the end.
[01:32:24.451 --> 01:32:49.247]  But I want to ask you to commit, by word of mouth and by prayer, in the public realm and in personal soul, but also in the physical, the energy you expend every day in the system, to transfer part of that to us, to know that there is a full commitment to push our will against the enemy with everything we've got, and to lean in when their knives are stabbing into our guts, to lean into their hate, and just lean in and take it.
[01:32:50.007 --> 01:32:50.448]  I'm ready.
[01:32:50.468 --> 01:32:52.409]  And I'll lean in and I'll take it.
[01:32:52.710 --> 01:32:58.615]  But I need your backing so that when I swing my sword, it'll absolutely devastate the enemy.
[01:32:58.775 --> 01:33:01.838]  And when I raise my shield, it's your will that empowers it.
[01:33:06.923 --> 01:33:09.526]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.723 --> 01:33:29.344]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:29.824 --> 01:33:31.365]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:38.727 --> 01:33:42.109]  All right, so what was the most powerful points in last night's State of the Union?
[01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:44.049]  And what were the most disgusting points?
[01:33:44.069 --> 01:33:44.890]  I haven't gotten a lot of these.
[01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:46.050]  I'm going to your phone calls right now.
[01:33:46.450 --> 01:33:48.611]  Sir Rose is coming on next hour to co-host with us.
[01:33:49.912 --> 01:33:53.173]  I've got a little satire piece I'm doing on Joe Rogan since I'm obsessed with that right now.
[01:33:53.193 --> 01:33:56.393]  At the start of the next hour, a little Sneaky Snakes is going to join us in the studio.
[01:33:57.573 --> 01:33:59.814]  So that's all coming up.
[01:34:03.094 --> 01:34:08.995]  But the first thing I want to do here is just say this.
[01:34:11.276 --> 01:34:15.717]  I support President Trump because my gut's never been wrong.
[01:34:15.997 --> 01:34:18.157]  And the older I get, the more I learn to just go with it.
[01:34:23.063 --> 01:34:25.824]  But he's surrounded and he's got major problems.
[01:34:30.586 --> 01:34:33.527]  And I don't need to list all those, but I pretty much know those problems.
[01:34:34.707 --> 01:34:37.748]  We just can't put all our eggs in the one basket.
[01:34:37.768 --> 01:34:40.929]  Trump, you can't put all your eggs in this basket.
[01:34:41.290 --> 01:34:44.151]  Alex Jones, you can't put all the eggs in your own basket.
[01:34:44.171 --> 01:34:46.511]  You know, we all have our own hopes and dreams.
[01:34:46.551 --> 01:34:47.812]  We hope our children can fulfill them.
[01:34:49.406 --> 01:34:50.607]  All our hopes and dreams go with them.
[01:34:50.767 --> 01:34:51.948]  That's why they're attacking them.
[01:34:53.269 --> 01:34:53.890]  They're the future.
[01:34:57.352 --> 01:34:58.674]  And it's a real war for the future.
[01:35:00.495 --> 01:35:06.400]  And my biggest regret is I just don't have enough strength or energy to do what I really should do for people.
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:09.702]  And that's why I hate it when you call in and tell me how great I am.
[01:35:09.742 --> 01:35:15.167]  Listen, when you're, when you're fighting people,
[01:35:17.776 --> 01:35:20.619]  That their whole religion is about torturing children.
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:24.262]  It's obnoxious to tell me I'm great when I'm doing that.
[01:35:24.502 --> 01:35:25.423]  That's normal!
[01:35:28.786 --> 01:35:29.727]  I use the allegory.
[01:35:29.747 --> 01:35:35.872]  They got famous cases where, you know, a car comes over on some little kid and mom gets so upset she can pick the car up.
[01:35:38.094 --> 01:35:39.355]  I've been trying to pick the car up.
[01:35:39.455 --> 01:35:40.076]  I can't do it.
[01:35:47.833 --> 01:35:51.995]  Even though I'm spiritually stronger than I've ever been, I can feel my legs getting weak under the enemy's attack.
[01:35:56.877 --> 01:35:58.278]  And I can feel my body giving out.
[01:36:01.059 --> 01:36:03.641]  And then I just ask myself, who are the other people that are going to fight this?
[01:36:04.141 --> 01:36:09.023]  And I see some prospects out there, but you know, most people just can't handle the truth.
[01:36:09.583 --> 01:36:10.904]  They just can't deal with it.
[01:36:17.145 --> 01:36:17.966]  I just don't know what to say.
[01:36:18.046 --> 01:36:24.890]  I just can't believe we're in this position that the president's a hero because he says we shouldn't kill babies after they're born.
[01:36:25.410 --> 01:36:26.911]  Man, imagine that.
[01:36:26.951 --> 01:36:28.172]  That's so freakish.
[01:36:28.252 --> 01:36:29.213]  That's so sick.
[01:36:32.335 --> 01:36:32.855]  So you know what?
[01:36:33.475 --> 01:36:41.040]  I was going to say today that President Trump defending babies that are already born was the best part of the speech.
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:41.541]  But you know what?
[01:36:41.561 --> 01:36:42.221]  It's the worst part.
[01:36:45.345 --> 01:36:47.545]  I watched this like six, seven times last night.
[01:36:47.565 --> 01:36:48.886]  I probably watched it 10 times this morning.
[01:36:50.086 --> 01:36:51.406]  I probably watched it 20 times, actually.
[01:36:56.667 --> 01:36:58.228]  Then I went, because I knew I had to see it.
[01:36:58.328 --> 01:36:58.968]  I had to see it.
[01:36:59.648 --> 01:36:59.888]  I went.
[01:36:59.908 --> 01:37:00.748]  It took me 30 minutes.
[01:37:00.808 --> 01:37:01.949]  I found cutaway shots.
[01:37:03.069 --> 01:37:08.910]  And the Democrats were looking at him like they wanted to kill him when he didn't want to kill babies.
[01:37:15.461 --> 01:37:17.882]  At a certain point, I don't know what we're supposed to do at this point.
[01:37:17.942 --> 01:37:24.964]  I mean... It's just... What the hell is going on here?
[01:37:27.105 --> 01:37:33.347]  They'll tell you all day about... If you call a tranny the wrong name, you're gonna go to jail.
[01:37:33.367 --> 01:37:37.829]  But if you want to kill a little baby, because you want their damn organs, that's good.
[01:37:38.869 --> 01:37:41.010]  These people are just horrible.
[01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:42.990]  Because they're not people.
[01:37:44.391 --> 01:37:44.851]  They're demons.
[01:37:46.912 --> 01:38:03.644]  And I already knew that, but it's the realization that in February 2019, the underdog is the people protecting babies that are already born.
[01:38:03.684 --> 01:38:05.706]  But hell, you're going to kill them in the womb.
[01:38:06.226 --> 01:38:07.067]  Why not go even?
[01:38:07.167 --> 01:38:07.747]  Exactly.
[01:38:08.247 --> 01:38:13.131]  And the case for killing granny and let's get rid of old people because we'll have a better world once we get rid of everybody.
[01:38:13.531 --> 01:38:15.773]  We build a civilization on taking care of people.
[01:38:17.517 --> 01:38:20.898]  But again, the enemy says they're trying to save the earth, they're trying to kill the earth.
[01:38:21.238 --> 01:38:23.479]  They say they care about old people, they want to euthanize them.
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:31.541]  And America and the world is like caught in a trance.
[01:38:34.682 --> 01:38:35.602]  It's a trance, it's a spell.
[01:38:37.332 --> 01:38:43.836]  People are literally, physically, mathematically mesmerized by television and the flicker rates in all the systems.
[01:38:45.117 --> 01:38:48.579]  And there's a dark, ancient, evil force, not of this world.
[01:38:51.561 --> 01:38:56.764]  You can give it a name, you can postulate, but you know what it is.
[01:38:59.185 --> 01:39:00.066]  It's a torpedo.
[01:39:02.547 --> 01:39:03.468]  The Earth is a womb.
[01:39:04.789 --> 01:39:05.189]  An egg.
[01:39:06.425 --> 01:39:08.606]  Giving birth to an amazing species.
[01:39:08.626 --> 01:39:13.389]  I mean, in our dreams, as embryonic creatures, we've already built all this.
[01:39:13.409 --> 01:39:14.930]  Can you imagine what we are?
[01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:20.733]  But any egg is a plump, juicy treat.
[01:39:23.475 --> 01:39:26.716]  Because there isn't just big, beautiful, good things in the universe.
[01:39:27.577 --> 01:39:28.377]  There's snakes.
[01:39:30.158 --> 01:39:30.739]  Slithering.
[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:32.720]  Watching.
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:34.561]  Coiling.
[01:39:38.933 --> 01:39:45.237]  I want to hit this Gavin McGinnis piece after this piece, but here is the president speaking blasphemy.
[01:39:46.218 --> 01:39:47.459]  Killing children isn't good.
[01:39:47.799 --> 01:39:49.000]  Satanism in front of you.
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:53.022]  The bad guy says don't kill already born children.
[01:39:53.983 --> 01:39:56.205]  Oh, but there's no Satan that's killing children.
[01:39:57.946 --> 01:39:58.406]  Here it is.
[01:39:59.747 --> 01:40:06.972]  There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child
[01:40:08.271 --> 01:40:12.273]  Than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days.
[01:40:14.495 --> 01:40:27.502]  Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments from birth.
[01:40:28.803 --> 01:40:36.267]  These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world.
[01:40:37.802 --> 01:40:46.008]  And then we had the case of the governor of Virginia, where he stated he would execute a baby after birth.
[01:40:47.489 --> 01:40:54.255]  To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation
[01:40:55.137 --> 01:41:01.280]  To prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain.
[01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:02.240]  Pelosi's like that.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:06.882]  She's like a doll and you're like taking a steak away from her.
[01:41:06.922 --> 01:41:07.702]  She starts salivating.
[01:41:07.722 --> 01:41:10.663]  I mean, conspiracy to her like that.
[01:41:11.964 --> 01:41:14.085]  He gives me power, babies!
[01:41:15.986 --> 01:41:17.426]  She's literally salivating.
[01:41:17.946 --> 01:41:22.568]  Like a giant T-bone steak that just came off the grill is being pulled back from her.
[01:41:22.848 --> 01:41:23.529]  And we come back.
[01:41:24.451 --> 01:41:25.951]  The most powerful footage in your calls.
[01:41:27.412 --> 01:41:29.072]  He says we're stopping child kidnapping.
[01:41:29.092 --> 01:41:30.613]  We're stopping, you know, sex gangs.
[01:41:31.233 --> 01:41:32.773]  The Democrats are like pissed.
[01:41:32.793 --> 01:41:36.194]  Because, I mean, they're making hard, cold cash on that, baby.
[01:41:37.475 --> 01:41:40.475]  And you think you're going to stop a bunch of smugglers like Cortez?
[01:41:41.636 --> 01:41:42.576]  You ain't stopping nothing.
[01:41:43.536 --> 01:41:44.837]  You going to bring these people in?
[01:41:45.397 --> 01:41:46.437]  Schumer, all these people?
[01:41:46.717 --> 01:41:47.117]  Oh, man.
[01:41:47.137 --> 01:41:48.658]  All right, we're going to break.
[01:41:49.698 --> 01:41:52.699]  Please don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, without your support,
[01:41:53.922 --> 01:41:55.445]  Without your prayers, we're nothing.
[01:41:56.126 --> 01:41:57.749]  And I'm in your hands.
[01:41:57.769 --> 01:41:58.411]  It's that simple.
[01:41:59.172 --> 01:42:00.034]  I appreciate you all.
[01:42:00.354 --> 01:42:01.116]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:42:02.902 --> 01:42:06.685]  ForgeLife.com or 888-253-3139.

[01:42:11.988 --> 01:42:13.890]  The supplements are bar none incredible.

[01:42:41.965 --> 01:42:44.766]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:42:44.946 --> 01:42:48.727]  It's the final countdown.
[01:42:49.808 --> 01:42:52.669]  Certain forces want to strangle humanity in the crib.
[01:42:53.989 --> 01:42:56.721]  Some of us don't want to collaborate and decided to find back.
[01:42:57.344 --> 01:42:57.766]  Stay with us.
[01:43:03.339 --> 01:43:09.321]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:43:09.701 --> 01:43:12.302]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:43:12.902 --> 01:43:16.344]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:43:16.604 --> 01:43:20.885]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:43:21.306 --> 01:43:24.567]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:43:25.467 --> 01:43:35.710]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:45.013]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[01:43:46.653 --> 01:43:55.177]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:44:00.159 --> 01:44:02.220]  I've been on air 24 years and I set out to
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:19.206]  Awaken America and the world because I believed that humanity weren't cowards and the humanity wasn't stupid.
[01:44:19.646 --> 01:44:34.478]  That if folks were shown the facts of what was being constructed by the globalists, by the technocrats, and that their endgame is a anti-God, anti-human, satanic world system, I believed that good men and women would stand up and rally against it.
[01:44:34.658 --> 01:44:37.261]  And I don't take all the credit for what's happened with Infowars.
[01:44:37.321 --> 01:44:38.982]  In fact, I take very little of the credit.
[01:44:39.122 --> 01:44:54.223]  I believe there was a focal point laying it out with the evidence, as only the internet coming into its own 24 years ago could allow, up until that point in history, that people would respond and that the population would start researching themselves and that it would trigger a chain reaction.
[01:44:54.524 --> 01:44:55.525]  I never intended, though,
[01:44:56.346 --> 01:44:59.468]  To be a hyper-dominant leader at the forefront of this.
[01:44:59.708 --> 01:45:05.812]  I was always about having other guests and other individuals and groups on who were experts in their field to help inform the public even better than I could.
[01:45:05.832 --> 01:45:14.336]  But in the last 10 years, InfoWars became the dominant leader, globally, in rebooting nationalism and renaissance against the globalist, post-industrial, neo-feudalist system.
[01:45:14.497 --> 01:45:21.801]  But the globalists ignored that, which was fine with me, until about three years ago, when they decided to use me against Trump and other nationalists
[01:45:22.381 --> 01:45:25.962]  By misrepresenting who I was and what I really said, and taking me out of context.
[01:45:26.162 --> 01:45:34.585]  That miscalculation actually spread anti-New World Order information technology around the world faster, and was critical in putting Trump over the top.
[01:45:34.745 --> 01:45:51.750]  And then, they made the decision, because of all the chain reactions everywhere, where there were fan videos every day with 5, 10 million views apiece, and hundreds of millions of views a week on different platforms, not even of my own show, but of derivatives of what I was saying and doing, they hit the panic button and said, we were already looking at total censorship.
[01:45:52.170 --> 01:45:52.891]  In the next few years.
[01:45:53.511 --> 01:45:58.096]  But let's accelerate the plan, start with him, and then drop the hammer on everybody else.
[01:45:59.217 --> 01:45:59.658]  And it's here.
[01:46:00.799 --> 01:46:05.543]  Total surveillance, they're listening, they're watching on your phone, on your TV, it's going into AI computers.
[01:46:06.324 --> 01:46:11.389]  The technocracy's on an incredible power trip, horrible leftists trained in the universities to hate you and your family.
[01:46:12.341 --> 01:46:18.503]  Have been brought into these cults of big tech who are allowed to have access to everything you do.
[01:46:18.523 --> 01:46:26.046]  It's in the news today that you have a brain tumor, that you're pregnant, that you're depressed, that you have HIV, that you're gay.
[01:46:26.327 --> 01:46:31.509]  Whatever it is, they're there raping your privacy while calling themselves liberal.
[01:46:31.689 --> 01:46:32.189]  They're a fraud.
[01:46:32.269 --> 01:46:35.070]  But the things they've done to this, the things they've pulled against InfoWars,
[01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:48.733]  If our audience doesn't realize how critical it is, and don't keep spreading the word, and don't keep sharing articles and videos, and don't keep buying the great products you already need anyways, The Globalist will be successful in the next year or so shutting down InfoWars.
[01:46:48.773 --> 01:46:50.473]  So, I'm shooting up the bat signal here.
[01:46:50.813 --> 01:47:00.355]  You've really supported us over the years, but the fight's now reaching the critical part of the battle, and I need your commitment to get great products you already need, but to steadfastly get them at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:47:06.343 --> 01:47:10.946]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:28.399]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:47:29.019 --> 01:47:30.620]  Waiting for the Seanans.
[01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:40.550]  The island without pain.
[01:47:41.611 --> 01:47:41.931]  Heaven.
[01:47:44.533 --> 01:47:50.378]  Alright, I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:47:51.919 --> 01:47:53.520]  But because I mentioned it, I'm gonna do it.
[01:47:54.982 --> 01:47:59.445]  These videos, if you're a radio listener and I'll try to describe them, are so horrible.
[01:47:59.565 --> 01:48:07.572]  Like, I don't sit there and look at the women's consortium of Democrats
[01:48:09.583 --> 01:48:20.207]  And like, feel good that they're so, not just physically ugly, but so twisted and mentally ill and fake and slovenly.
[01:48:20.227 --> 01:48:24.609]  We were the first to put memes out saying, you know, because they say everything's KKK when it's not.
[01:48:25.009 --> 01:48:26.630]  So, oh, they're all wearing white.
[01:48:26.650 --> 01:48:29.571]  Obviously, they're saying we're goddesses, we're pure, we're good.
[01:48:30.711 --> 01:48:33.492]  We kill our babies, though, but, you know, that's not a goddess.
[01:48:34.633 --> 01:48:36.994]  But they're all wearing white, having no idea
[01:48:38.081 --> 01:48:40.863]  That obviously if Republican women did that, they'd say they were in the KKK.
[01:48:41.803 --> 01:48:42.984]  So the memes are all out there.
[01:48:43.804 --> 01:48:45.005]  Democrat women wear white.
[01:48:45.085 --> 01:48:45.445]  KKK.
[01:48:45.465 --> 01:48:46.186]  You can search it.
[01:48:46.206 --> 01:48:47.006]  I should have told you about it.
[01:48:47.787 --> 01:48:48.987]  But we put some out last night.
[01:48:50.288 --> 01:48:51.269]  But there they are.
[01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:53.590]  And it wasn't just a few times.
[01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:57.192]  Trump would say, we're stopping child kidnapping and women being kidnapped.
[01:48:57.252 --> 01:48:58.013]  And they'd get pissed.
[01:48:58.373 --> 01:48:59.133]  And we're doing this.
[01:48:59.513 --> 01:49:03.736]  And as you should realize, when Pelosi said that MS-13 are God's children,
[01:49:07.210 --> 01:49:09.992]  You have to understand, folks, these are the muscle of these people.
[01:49:10.872 --> 01:49:11.212]  Literally.
[01:49:11.993 --> 01:49:12.993]  They're into all this.
[01:49:13.033 --> 01:49:15.755]  That's who they use for their dirty activity.
[01:49:16.575 --> 01:49:20.097]  They give the word, and then the guy in prison gives the order to kill people.
[01:49:20.858 --> 01:49:22.579]  And then you just hear it's a carjacking gone bad.
[01:49:22.639 --> 01:49:23.519]  These are killers.
[01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:26.621]  They're low IQ killers.
[01:49:27.541 --> 01:49:35.406]  And so, they're pretty arrogant because in their cities, in their areas, let me tell you something, these people get away with everything.
[01:49:37.418 --> 01:49:48.287]  And the globalists will turn America into a cross between Venezuela and North Korea and the Soviet Union faster than you can say, kiss my hand.
[01:49:52.690 --> 01:49:55.212]  So, the more things change, the more they stay the same.
[01:49:55.232 --> 01:50:05.220]  I mean, if the Democrats weren't the party of the KKK, if they weren't the party that passed laws to give blacks three times the prison sentence for nonviolent crimes that Trump just reversed,
[01:50:06.138 --> 01:50:06.859]  That it wouldn't fit.
[01:50:07.219 --> 01:50:08.960]  It's a joke how bad they are.
[01:50:09.301 --> 01:50:10.762]  They're the bad people.
[01:50:12.063 --> 01:50:15.826]  And the Republicans are a bunch of intimidated cowards, and half of them are bad too.
[01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:23.312]  I've never seen anything like it in my life.
[01:50:23.832 --> 01:50:24.813]  I just at a certain point...
[01:50:25.939 --> 01:50:26.879]  See, I'm having flashbacks.
[01:50:26.939 --> 01:50:30.761]  Problem is, I study all day long, and then once I get on air, it's kind of like I've already looked at it.
[01:50:30.801 --> 01:50:32.902]  I'm like, almost like I'm doing something bad.
[01:50:32.962 --> 01:50:34.242]  Like, let me show you this.
[01:50:34.362 --> 01:50:35.262]  It's like, ugh.
[01:50:35.343 --> 01:50:37.263]  It's like, you think I want to get up here and go?
[01:50:37.323 --> 01:50:40.004]  They're splicing babies with mice for organ harvesting?
[01:50:40.284 --> 01:50:41.305]  I knew it 20 years ago.
[01:50:41.585 --> 01:50:42.585]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:50:42.785 --> 01:50:44.566]  So I'm discredited, because I'm right again.
[01:50:47.793 --> 01:50:50.514]  Folks, I wouldn't steer you wrong if they had a gun to my head.
[01:50:50.734 --> 01:50:51.634]  Everybody knows that.
[01:50:52.334 --> 01:50:55.295]  Like, there's all this damn evil in the world, and then I'm real.
[01:50:55.655 --> 01:50:58.016]  I can't sit up here and act like Goody Two-Shoes sometimes.
[01:50:58.056 --> 01:50:58.956]  I'll tell a dirty joke.
[01:50:59.336 --> 01:51:01.496]  I like women, because I like having babies.
[01:51:03.197 --> 01:51:04.957]  But man, I don't like the devil.
[01:51:05.977 --> 01:51:11.779]  And everybody needs to understand, you're not going to get somebody that's going to take on the devil most of the time, that acts like Jesus Christ, because I'm not perfect.
[01:51:14.855 --> 01:51:17.356]  I don't want to, the point is I try to be a nice person.
[01:51:19.457 --> 01:51:30.883]  But I've been in this so long now that when you got up to fight this stuff, it's like Joe Rogan said, Alex is not well.
[01:51:31.364 --> 01:51:31.764]  It's true.
[01:51:32.744 --> 01:51:33.565]  I'm not well.
[01:51:34.525 --> 01:51:39.768]  I don't, I see people saying we're going to kill newborn babies and it's a good thing and it makes me upset.
[01:51:39.868 --> 01:51:40.829]  See, you're well.
[01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.949]  You know, they always said in the
[01:51:43.775 --> 01:51:46.748]  Kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
[01:51:48.877 --> 01:51:49.017]  See?
[01:51:51.010 --> 01:51:55.171]  And so, I'm just a normal person, like a throwback.
[01:51:55.191 --> 01:51:56.391]  The programming didn't work on me.
[01:51:56.731 --> 01:52:06.434]  I'm somebody from the 1920s that teleported into the future, and I watch the State of the Union, and the President's saying, we don't kill babies after they're born, and then he's the bad guy, and you know what?
[01:52:06.494 --> 01:52:07.374]  I get pretty freaked out.
[01:52:07.634 --> 01:52:10.015]  I start wanting to, you know, unscrew some people's heads.
[01:52:10.955 --> 01:52:12.135]  I start wanting to kill people.
[01:52:12.615 --> 01:52:17.217]  I'll be honest, as a man, hearing about babies getting killed, you know, that's what a man does!
[01:52:17.437 --> 01:52:18.477]  Man starts getting pissed!
[01:52:20.936 --> 01:52:22.197]  And I'm supposed to cut the emotions off?
[01:52:22.697 --> 01:52:24.858]  Because I'm not like these sociopaths and psychopaths.
[01:52:24.898 --> 01:52:25.799]  I have deep emotions.
[01:52:26.859 --> 01:52:33.023]  And I get pissed at myself constantly that I'm not doing enough for all these children with these damn demons raping the hell out of them.
[01:52:34.243 --> 01:52:36.604]  So I'm just going to ask everybody again, what am I supposed to do?
[01:52:36.765 --> 01:52:37.225]  I don't know.
[01:52:38.125 --> 01:52:38.986]  What are you supposed to do?
[01:52:39.306 --> 01:52:43.348]  But just don't ever say it's extraordinary to fight people who are like this.
[01:52:43.508 --> 01:52:44.549]  It's the default.
[01:52:44.829 --> 01:52:48.371]  And if you're not doing it, then you're on the enemy side, period!
[01:52:53.186 --> 01:52:57.529]  These godless, selfish people that serve evil are jokes.
[01:52:58.429 --> 01:53:01.711]  You know, at least the devil worshipper loves the devil and wants to torture a kid to death.
[01:53:02.292 --> 01:53:06.994]  But the people that know what's going on, that make deals with it, they're what allows the evil to exist.
[01:53:07.275 --> 01:53:08.455]  And they're the worst.
[01:53:08.695 --> 01:53:12.818]  Like God said, you were hot or cold, I spit you out of my mouth.
[01:53:13.919 --> 01:53:14.679]  I know the devil.
[01:53:14.999 --> 01:53:19.142]  I know the sick, twisted psychology and the whole game.
[01:53:22.662 --> 01:53:31.148]  that decide to serve it even though they don't have a taste for it are the real people that I look forward to.
[01:53:32.909 --> 01:53:40.434]  I'm not a sadistic person, but I do look forward to you begging for God
[01:53:41.806 --> 01:53:43.427]  Begging, like those children beg.
[01:53:43.667 --> 01:53:45.768]  You're going to beg Joe Rogan so hard.
[01:53:46.688 --> 01:53:49.349]  Before you're gone, you're going to beg God.
[01:53:49.689 --> 01:53:52.271]  You're going to beg and beg and God's not gonna come.
[01:53:53.111 --> 01:53:53.511]  You understand?
[01:53:53.671 --> 01:53:53.991]  You understand?
[01:53:54.231 --> 01:53:54.792]  God's not coming.
[01:53:56.713 --> 01:54:01.315]  God's not coming for George Soros or Jack Dorsey or any of you.
[01:54:02.275 --> 01:54:04.576]  So you better take as many kids with you as you can.
[01:54:12.762 --> 01:54:14.023]  And you're separated from God.
[01:54:14.043 --> 01:54:18.748]  It's not going to be funny anymore.
[01:54:20.209 --> 01:54:21.731]  You're not going to be in charge anymore.
[01:54:22.712 --> 01:54:27.737]  You're not going to be sitting up with the establishment, believing that you're administering everything.
[01:54:27.897 --> 01:54:28.457]  Oh, yes.
[01:54:28.918 --> 01:54:29.959]  You administer nothing.
[01:54:31.961 --> 01:54:33.462]  You failed the test.
[01:54:34.103 --> 01:54:34.864]  You're a failure.
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:37.960]  And you look at those Democrats.
[01:54:38.941 --> 01:54:41.922]  I didn't know they could stack treason that high.
[01:54:43.302 --> 01:54:48.284]  I didn't know there was such weak, pathetic worms that could be recruited and organized.
[01:54:50.004 --> 01:54:55.166]  I didn't know such mentally ill, low IQ garbage slithered on this planet.
[01:54:56.126 --> 01:54:56.807]  But they do.
[01:55:01.348 --> 01:55:04.029]  And our blindness has let them take over.
[01:55:06.118 --> 01:55:07.259]  Our spiritual weakness.
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:10.741]  Our attempt to make deals.
[01:55:11.921 --> 01:55:12.722]  It's all over now.
[01:55:12.742 --> 01:55:15.643]  All right, we'll go to break.
[01:55:15.663 --> 01:55:16.784]  Come back with calls, I promise.
[01:55:16.944 --> 01:55:17.604]  Sugar on top.
[01:55:18.925 --> 01:55:19.605]  Pinky promise.
[01:55:20.146 --> 01:55:21.146]  But let's play a few of these clips.
[01:55:21.186 --> 01:55:21.366]  Here.
[01:55:21.647 --> 01:55:23.087]  Here, let's play Alexander Cortez.
[01:55:23.107 --> 01:55:23.828]  That's not even a bad one.
[01:55:25.068 --> 01:55:29.091]  Failed to applaud stopping sex trafficking of girls.
[01:55:29.131 --> 01:55:31.152]  And like 30 seconds in, they go, hey, get up, lady.
[01:55:31.172 --> 01:55:34.254]  I mean, you talk about a meth head.
[01:55:34.334 --> 01:55:34.674]  Here it is.
[01:55:35.816 --> 01:55:43.304]  Today he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking.
[01:55:44.666 --> 01:55:54.097]  Elvin says that if I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've really done my job.
[01:55:55.592 --> 01:56:10.025]  Thanks to his work and that of his incredible colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the horror of this terrible situation.
[01:56:11.025 --> 01:56:19.132]  And more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars.
[01:56:23.877 --> 01:56:27.078]  Mike Fortes is just on her own little planet.
[01:56:29.699 --> 01:56:30.820]  That's what a slave looks like.
[01:56:33.501 --> 01:56:34.221]  Will not clap.
[01:56:34.961 --> 01:56:36.062]  They grab her and tell her to stand up.
[01:56:36.102 --> 01:56:36.722]  It's on her.
[01:56:36.762 --> 01:56:37.762]  Clap, clap, clap.
[01:56:38.463 --> 01:56:39.323]  She wouldn't clap.
[01:56:40.103 --> 01:56:41.084]  She's a ruling class, man.
[01:56:42.583 --> 01:56:43.283]  Look at her eyes.
[01:56:43.323 --> 01:56:45.884]  I mean, that is a demon-driven creature.
[01:56:46.405 --> 01:56:46.865]  Okay.
[01:56:46.965 --> 01:56:49.486]  Literally, they're a gray alien.
[01:56:50.266 --> 01:56:52.667]  Let's go ahead and go to this next clip.
[01:56:52.707 --> 01:56:59.189]  Camilla Harris shakes head at Trump combating cartels and human traffickers, because that's her bread and butter, man.
[01:56:59.590 --> 01:56:59.970]  Here it is.
[01:57:00.710 --> 01:57:07.753]  Now is the time for Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration,
[01:57:08.706 --> 01:57:18.548]  And putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.
[01:57:18.568 --> 01:57:21.628]  Oh, I hate this show now.
[01:57:21.648 --> 01:57:34.491]  I mean... My God, oh my goodness.
[01:57:34.511 --> 01:57:35.471]  Michael, let's hear it for Kamala Harris.
[01:57:43.049 --> 01:57:46.272]  We have a moral duty to create an immigration system.
[01:57:46.312 --> 01:57:48.695]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with your calls, I promise.
[01:57:49.836 --> 01:57:51.097]  Third hour, you might want to spread the links.
[01:57:53.476 --> 01:58:00.842]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[01:58:01.462 --> 01:58:07.266]  And a lot of times we reach out to top companies and they don't want to private label to us because, well, we're InfoWars and we've been demonized.
[01:58:07.326 --> 01:58:11.630]  But a lot of times, people will work with us only because we're InfoWars.
[01:58:12.230 --> 01:58:27.822]  Well, there is a national company, and I'm not going to name them because we're not in competition with them, but we probably label the product, who has FDA approval for years to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there until you get to prescription level of wound gel that can be sold in stores.
[01:58:28.482 --> 01:58:35.347]  And we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[01:58:35.927 --> 01:58:37.569]  But the announcement here today is this.
[01:58:38.269 --> 01:58:41.752]  We've been selling a lot of the Wound Gel and a lot of the Immune Garden.
[01:58:42.192 --> 01:58:44.474]  In fact, we just put in big orders for both of them.
[01:58:45.234 --> 01:58:55.987]  But then I noticed without us even plugging it, because of all the scary stuff going on this winter with viruses and bacteria spreading at record levels, that it was all flying off the shelves at regular price.
[01:58:56.648 --> 01:59:02.334]  And so unlike other companies and other groups that do things like raise prices during a crisis,
[01:59:02.955 --> 01:59:11.558]  We're going to go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:12.019 --> 01:59:12.919]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:13.279 --> 01:59:17.200]  We're going to go to 40% off because I just put a big order in.
[01:59:17.501 --> 01:59:23.123]  It'll be a few months till more comes in, but I want you to have the impetus and the initiative to get it for yourself and your family.
[01:59:23.923 --> 01:59:27.265]  Get a great discount, see how great it works, and become a repeat customer.
[01:59:27.525 --> 01:59:32.207]  It's just as a Texan, and as American, and as a patriot, that's how I want to be treated.
[01:59:32.707 --> 01:59:39.990]  That when there's a crisis, if people really need something and want it, I'm going to sell it at a huge discount instead of selling it at full price because I noticed you were buying it.
[01:59:40.350 --> 01:59:46.493]  So because you're supporting us and already buying it, both the products, 40% off, as a combo, for 40% off.
[01:59:46.833 --> 01:59:47.453]  Individually.
[01:59:47.713 --> 01:59:48.554]  All supplies last.
[01:59:48.814 --> 01:59:50.815]  Nemfoolwareslife.com or by calling toll free.
[01:59:50.835 --> 01:59:50.875]  888-253-3139.
[01:59:56.710 --> 02:00:03.235]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:04.376 --> 02:00:04.937]  We've got it.
[02:00:04.977 --> 02:00:11.141]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:00:11.502 --> 02:00:13.603]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:14.544 --> 02:00:21.509]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:00:26.209 --> 02:00:27.630]  I'll say it again, number one of your calls.
[02:00:29.311 --> 02:00:35.074]  The worst part of President Trump's speech was what I thought was the best part.
[02:00:35.794 --> 02:00:43.298]  But in hindsight, it's the best part that he says we shouldn't kill babies after they're born, and then Democrats boo?
[02:00:43.318 --> 02:00:46.020]  I mean, this is Twilight Zone, man.
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:49.862]  The Democrats are for all these wars, they don't want to let black people out of jail.
[02:00:51.434 --> 02:00:56.756]  I mean, it's like these people have uncloaked as howling demons.
[02:01:02.439 --> 02:01:03.800]  And it's hard to beat them?
[02:01:08.862 --> 02:01:10.122]  We've been put in a trance or something.
[02:01:10.142 --> 02:01:11.683]  I just don't even know what to say at this point.
[02:01:14.389 --> 02:01:15.609]  I guess that's why I'm going to go to your calls.
[02:01:16.230 --> 02:01:17.630]  What was the best part of Trump's speech?
[02:01:17.670 --> 02:01:20.071]  What was the worst thing you saw from the crowd?
[02:01:20.091 --> 02:01:33.336]  Or maybe you think Alexandria Cortez shaking her head or Kamala Harris shaking her head like we're stopping sex slavery and we're no you're not gonna stop it I mean it's like who are these freaks man?
[02:01:36.917 --> 02:01:37.997]  Who are these freaks?
[02:01:39.358 --> 02:01:40.258]  Like this governor!
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:46.822]  In Virginia, we keep the baby comfortable and we... I mean, it's like... What?
[02:01:51.364 --> 02:01:52.444]  And the directive has come down.
[02:01:53.044 --> 02:01:54.205]  Normalize killing children.
[02:01:54.265 --> 02:01:55.325]  Normalize killing everybody.
[02:01:55.345 --> 02:01:56.786]  Just kill, kill, kill, kill.
[02:01:58.586 --> 02:01:59.227]  Bernie Sanders.
[02:01:59.267 --> 02:02:00.927]  America will never be a socialist country.
[02:02:01.007 --> 02:02:02.348]  Bernie Sanders, a crook.
[02:02:04.079 --> 02:02:09.322]  That rob universities of just a swindling, just sack of inhuman trash.
[02:02:10.142 --> 02:02:15.825]  Lobbying that, oh, socialism's the way to go, and the big bankers he works for want socialism of the general public.
[02:02:16.545 --> 02:02:17.566]  Because they're exempt from it.
[02:02:19.046 --> 02:02:21.928]  Just a sack of garbage.
[02:02:24.764 --> 02:02:34.386]  An insecure, demonic, praying person, just every minute of his life is spent about how he is the best, and he's better than you, and he's going to get control of you.
[02:02:36.387 --> 02:02:38.527]  I'm telling you right now, Bernie Sanders has got control of America.
[02:02:38.547 --> 02:02:40.148]  It'd be Lennon-level red terror.
[02:02:40.948 --> 02:02:43.189]  Christian churches would be burned down coast to coast.
[02:02:43.529 --> 02:02:44.849]  People would be hanging out by their feet.
[02:02:45.909 --> 02:02:47.410]  You know, just like they did with the Arab Spring.
[02:02:47.730 --> 02:02:52.591]  The same globalist fun of the Arab Spring, because they hate Christians, and they hate women.
[02:02:53.789 --> 02:03:00.213]  And they hate the Western Renaissance egalitarian system because it'll take us past the stars.
[02:03:02.535 --> 02:03:03.315]  Past infinity.
[02:03:03.335 --> 02:03:05.477]  Because infinity is only in this universe.
[02:03:06.057 --> 02:03:06.657]  And he knows it.
[02:03:07.098 --> 02:03:13.062]  And he's literally a gatekeeper sellout who purchased... Hey, let's play the clip.
[02:03:13.082 --> 02:03:13.602]  I'm gonna get your calls.
[02:03:13.942 --> 02:03:14.903]  Here's Bernie Sanders.
[02:03:16.684 --> 02:03:17.344]  This worm.
[02:03:19.150 --> 02:03:26.419]  This demon perched on our chest trying to suffocate us, and he's just this arrogant degenerate.
[02:03:26.559 --> 02:03:27.000]  Here he is.
[02:03:28.402 --> 02:03:37.934]  Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country.
[02:03:42.159 --> 02:03:50.365]  America was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination, and control.
[02:03:51.006 --> 02:03:53.888]  We are born free, and we will stay free.
[02:03:53.908 --> 02:04:03.835]  And there's the enemy right there.
[02:04:03.855 --> 02:04:08.919]  Look at that son of a bitch.
[02:04:08.939 --> 02:04:09.400]  I'm so scared.
[02:04:15.373 --> 02:04:16.916]  I mean, how do you even respond to something?
[02:04:17.236 --> 02:04:19.921]  If you're a radio listener, you're so lucky not having to look at Bernie Sanders.
[02:04:21.423 --> 02:04:24.228]  Didn't have a paying job until he was 42 years old.
[02:04:29.355 --> 02:04:33.118]  The definition of a total sociopath.
[02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:36.601]  And he's so pissed you've got a soul.
[02:04:36.621 --> 02:04:39.263]  He's so pissed you're a good person.
[02:04:39.543 --> 02:04:40.684]  Hates you so much.
[02:04:41.184 --> 02:04:43.987]  Every moment of his day is just how does he hurt people?
[02:04:44.447 --> 02:04:45.748]  How does he poison America?
[02:04:45.808 --> 02:04:52.593]  He went to Russia where they had Christians in death camps and celebrated and danced in the streets with his shirt off, satanic dances.
[02:04:54.016 --> 02:04:55.939]  And he wants to hurt you so bad he will.
[02:04:56.581 --> 02:04:57.102]  If you let him.
[02:04:57.903 --> 02:04:58.925]  Your calls are one minute away.
[02:05:13.072 --> 02:05:21.497]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:05:22.097 --> 02:05:31.942]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:05:32.182 --> 02:05:40.707]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:05:41.596 --> 02:05:42.517]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:05:42.877 --> 02:05:43.918]  You must experience it.
[02:05:44.038 --> 02:05:45.959]  It is a total game changer.
[02:05:46.039 --> 02:05:50.382]  And it comes in easy to use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:05:51.043 --> 02:05:52.484]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[02:05:52.564 --> 02:05:53.545]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:05:54.045 --> 02:06:00.209]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:06:00.730 --> 02:06:02.231]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[02:06:14.577 --> 02:06:18.458]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:18.938 --> 02:06:21.279]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:06:25.801 --> 02:06:31.682]  Crucified for no sin.
[02:06:32.603 --> 02:06:33.643]  Stuart Rose is coming up.
[02:06:33.663 --> 02:06:36.484]  I'm going to host some in the next hour when I will interview Joe Rogan.
[02:06:36.504 --> 02:06:38.645]  Satire included.
[02:06:38.665 --> 02:06:40.325]  So look for that to start in the next hour.
[02:06:41.486 --> 02:06:42.266]  Let's go ahead.
[02:06:42.286 --> 02:06:42.786]  Joe will be like,
[02:06:43.621 --> 02:06:44.181]  And did he!
[02:06:44.201 --> 02:06:46.522]  He said I was coming on, but I wasn't!
[02:06:46.702 --> 02:06:47.222]  It wasn't true!
[02:06:47.262 --> 02:06:48.543]  It's called satire, buddy.
[02:06:50.163 --> 02:06:52.044]  By the way, brought to you by Jack Dorsey's!
[02:06:52.964 --> 02:06:53.424]  Hot plug!
[02:06:53.744 --> 02:06:54.044]  Sorry.
[02:06:55.485 --> 02:06:55.925]  Gettin' better.
[02:06:56.025 --> 02:06:56.425]  Gettin' better.
[02:06:56.505 --> 02:06:59.286]  I just... Best part of the song right here.
[02:06:59.306 --> 02:06:59.626]  Crank it up.
[02:07:01.767 --> 02:07:02.807]  Cemetery Gates, man.
[02:07:04.147 --> 02:07:05.588]  Gotta go walk by those sometime.
[02:07:07.737 --> 02:07:08.957]  Alright, I'm going to your phone calls.
[02:07:09.077 --> 02:07:17.159]  Joe, Bill, Alex, Andrew, Rudy, Judy, Debbie, Ted, Doyle, Cameron, Brad.
[02:07:18.159 --> 02:07:19.279]  Who's up first here?
[02:07:20.860 --> 02:07:22.280]  Who should I go to first?
[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:32.382]  You know, a lot of the globalists tricked us into their social networks, made it 90% of the internet, and now use it as a bully tool while claiming they're not censoring.
[02:07:32.402 --> 02:07:33.642]  What a group of crooks!
[02:07:38.871 --> 02:07:43.832]  Let's go to Doyle first in the great state of Indiana, where Mike Pence hails from.
[02:07:43.852 --> 02:07:44.892]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:07:45.852 --> 02:07:47.613]  Yes, God bless you, Alex.
[02:07:48.453 --> 02:07:49.453]  I have a question.
[02:07:49.513 --> 02:07:51.894]  They're using the term post-birth abortion.
[02:07:52.794 --> 02:07:58.135]  My question is, what's the time limit after the birth to kill the baby?
[02:07:58.335 --> 02:08:03.176]  Because I'm almost 60 and I could be, you know, I'm post-birth.
[02:08:04.441 --> 02:08:10.987]  And the fact that you said it's an alien invasion, and when they abort babies, they suck their brains out.
[02:08:11.547 --> 02:08:14.550]  And it's like the movie Starship Trooper.
[02:08:15.310 --> 02:08:18.672]  Where you have these big bug aliens that suck people's brains out?
[02:08:19.252 --> 02:08:20.513]  Brain bugs, exactly.
[02:08:20.553 --> 02:08:21.614]  They're telling you the whole deal.
[02:08:21.874 --> 02:08:23.515]  Well, the Satanists do eat baby brains.
[02:08:23.655 --> 02:08:24.475]  That's their favorite.
[02:08:24.755 --> 02:08:25.796]  That's the delicacy.
[02:08:25.816 --> 02:08:26.877]  It's been confirmed.
[02:08:27.177 --> 02:08:28.137]  Jimmy Savelle did it.
[02:08:28.558 --> 02:08:30.279]  Joe Rogan's like, Jones is crazy.
[02:08:30.619 --> 02:08:33.520]  He says that Jimmy Savelle was having sex with dead kids and eating their brains.
[02:08:34.061 --> 02:08:35.342]  It's in the BBC!
[02:08:35.362 --> 02:08:39.124]  I mean, I know it sounds like I'm crazy, because that's crazy.
[02:08:39.724 --> 02:08:45.289]  But if I'm telling you that I saw a homeless person on the side of the street eating their own feces, I'm not the crazy one.
[02:08:45.329 --> 02:08:48.292]  I'm like an anthropologist, a sociologist, telling you what I saw.
[02:08:48.312 --> 02:08:54.678]  But Joe either knows what's going on and is covering it up, or he just can't believe it.
[02:08:54.718 --> 02:08:56.880]  But you're absolutely right.
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:08:59.162]  You bring up this whole situation.
[02:08:59.662 --> 02:09:00.043]  Here's the deal.
[02:09:02.133 --> 02:09:08.518]  Baby parts and organs are up to $500,000 per baby, depending on how you do it.
[02:09:08.558 --> 02:09:17.205]  But if you can keep them alive and blood test them, then you're able to get donors, people, recipients ready, you can get hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[02:09:17.705 --> 02:09:24.350]  A baby's probably only worth like $100,000 on the chopping block if you sell it to a medical research facility when the baby's cold.
[02:09:25.171 --> 02:09:29.274]  But if you can get the organs out, get them on ice, get them ready, then you get a lot of money.
[02:09:29.314 --> 02:09:31.576]  So they keep these babies alive a couple weeks.
[02:09:32.765 --> 02:09:36.647]  I tell the mother, you decide your baby's got a problem, my love.
[02:09:36.927 --> 02:09:39.188]  That's actually what the governor is, a surgeon that did this, we now know.
[02:09:39.608 --> 02:09:40.469]  That's why he's such an expert.
[02:09:41.009 --> 02:09:43.190]  And then the mother's like, okay, she's all drugged up.
[02:09:43.250 --> 02:09:44.110]  She signs the forms.
[02:09:44.551 --> 02:09:50.573]  The baby's kept alive a week on a special wing, special nurses, special doctors.
[02:09:52.114 --> 02:09:56.876]  And then, exactly, now it's like suddenly, oh, post-birth abortion.
[02:09:57.497 --> 02:10:00.758]  Eight pound, nine pound, 10 pound, 7.6 pound, that's the average.
[02:10:03.272 --> 02:10:04.233]  I was 7.6 pounds, the average.
[02:10:04.814 --> 02:10:13.141]  That's what's going on, and then it's all just, the government don't need to get involved here, like the good governor said.
[02:10:13.702 --> 02:10:21.288]  We take care of it back there in the special, special wing of the hospital.
[02:10:22.269 --> 02:10:26.353]  And so, that's the next big shoot-up, why they want me off here, because I'll take you to the next level.
[02:10:27.850 --> 02:10:30.952]  Why is he hiding in plain view that they kill him after?
[02:10:31.612 --> 02:10:32.913]  Because they need the bills.
[02:10:32.973 --> 02:10:34.294]  Because people are now onto it.
[02:10:34.594 --> 02:10:35.874]  You know Planned Parenthood's been caught.
[02:10:36.235 --> 02:10:37.355]  Criminal indictments have happened.
[02:10:37.395 --> 02:10:38.676]  A bunch of the settlements have happened.
[02:10:38.696 --> 02:10:40.377]  Because they're keeping the babies alive.
[02:10:40.397 --> 02:10:41.037]  I'm going to say it again.
[02:10:41.057 --> 02:10:42.338]  It's like a fish tank.
[02:10:42.718 --> 02:10:43.839]  Let's say the fish are organs.
[02:10:44.739 --> 02:10:49.442]  If you keep the water going, what happens with the fish?
[02:10:49.982 --> 02:10:50.883]  They stay alive.
[02:10:52.250 --> 02:10:58.418]  So if you're wanting to sell some fish, you wouldn't take the plug out while you were putting ads on eBay for your saltwater tank.
[02:10:59.039 --> 02:11:01.002]  You'd keep feeding them and taking care of them.
[02:11:02.534 --> 02:11:05.016]  Because you could probably sell those fish in that saltwater tank for $1,000.
[02:11:05.056 --> 02:11:08.799]  I got a saltwater tank, it's probably got $1,000 of fish in it.
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:09.680]  Okay?
[02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:11.241]  Some of those fish are like 8 years old.
[02:11:11.541 --> 02:11:12.202]  So I'm taking care of it.
[02:11:12.602 --> 02:11:15.525]  But the point is, is that some of those fish were like $500 apiece.
[02:11:16.205 --> 02:11:18.968]  So, if I unplug it, they all die in about a day.
[02:11:19.428 --> 02:11:21.390]  And I don't get anything except this tank sale.
[02:11:22.170 --> 02:11:24.692]  But, if I keep the air going... $10,000...
[02:11:28.683 --> 02:11:46.415]  So see, you gotta keep the little baby, we keep him comfortable while we get ready for the, all the airplanes land, they got the ice chest, and then the procedure happen, and the organ sold.
[02:11:48.017 --> 02:11:49.538]  Now, is that diabolical, Doyle?
[02:11:51.179 --> 02:11:53.060]  Oh my gosh, it's beyond diabolical.
[02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:58.304]  It's just, I think Americans cannot process the evil
[02:11:59.034 --> 02:11:59.934]  Of the left.
[02:12:00.154 --> 02:12:01.715]  We just can't imagine it.
[02:12:01.795 --> 02:12:02.755]  We can't process it.
[02:12:02.855 --> 02:12:04.736]  And that's why they're getting away with so much of it.
[02:12:05.036 --> 02:12:05.496]  Exactly!
[02:12:05.836 --> 02:12:06.736]  It's like another language.
[02:12:06.816 --> 02:12:07.717]  It's like, what?
[02:12:11.078 --> 02:12:12.318]  Can I say one other thing?
[02:12:12.358 --> 02:12:12.878]  Go ahead, brother.
[02:12:14.259 --> 02:12:24.302]  I was just wanting to ask you, I think that if you wrote a book and put it in multiple translations, you'd get around the censors and you'd sell 100 million copies.
[02:12:26.792 --> 02:12:29.836]  The only problem is they death threat any publisher, they fire everybody.
[02:12:30.036 --> 02:12:41.592]  Sir, if you knew the stuff behind the scenes, it's, it's, I mean, I don't make a big deal out of it, because, I mean, I'm not a little kid getting chopped up, so I don't want to act like I'm under, I mean, I expect to be under attack, but it's cuckoo land attacks, but yes,
[02:12:42.253 --> 02:12:43.654]  We do want to try to put some books out.
[02:12:43.694 --> 02:12:46.035]  We do want to get the basics out and then get around.
[02:12:46.055 --> 02:12:47.455]  But I mean, people understand.
[02:12:47.515 --> 02:12:50.116]  It's like you can still get t-shirts today at InfoWars.
[02:12:50.136 --> 02:12:51.537]  You can still get products.
[02:12:51.897 --> 02:12:53.778]  They're trying every minute to shut us down.
[02:12:53.818 --> 02:12:54.858]  They're working around the clock.
[02:12:55.179 --> 02:12:55.619]  And I agree.
[02:12:55.679 --> 02:12:58.000]  I need to make a film that's a magnum opus.
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:03.848]  And I need to put a book out to just say, here's my testament, and here's what's going on, and we just need to get it done.
[02:13:03.868 --> 02:13:14.223]  The problem is, I'm so busy at the parapet, in constant war, that I can't get down into the study and actually put together a final transmission.
[02:13:14.844 --> 02:13:29.249]  And I don't want to be dramatic, but I mean, I think everybody knows we're kind of, you know, I consider every day going, well, do I tell people we're in a lot of trouble, which is true, or I just keep fighting and I just I just can't seem to I just can't seem to sound the retreat.
[02:13:29.969 --> 02:13:33.531]  So I'm just going to stay here at the point as long as I can.
[02:13:33.551 --> 02:13:34.811]  And I believe in you.
[02:13:34.911 --> 02:13:36.812]  I believe in God and I appreciate you, brother.
[02:13:36.832 --> 02:13:37.412]  God bless Doyle.
[02:13:38.773 --> 02:13:40.313]  And I appreciate this crew to putting up with me.
[02:13:41.193 --> 02:13:41.534]  I just.
[02:13:43.044 --> 02:13:45.064]  It's a very, very crazy point in this universe.
[02:13:45.084 --> 02:13:48.105]  Let's go to Debbie.
[02:13:48.625 --> 02:13:49.625]  Debbie in New Jersey.
[02:13:49.645 --> 02:13:50.405]  Debbie, thanks for calling.
[02:13:50.446 --> 02:13:51.226]  I really appreciate you.
[02:13:51.246 --> 02:13:52.106]  Go ahead, Debbie.
[02:13:52.846 --> 02:13:53.426]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:13:53.566 --> 02:13:55.386]  I'm not going to tell you how great you are.
[02:13:55.426 --> 02:13:56.627]  I'll just tell you that you stink.
[02:13:57.287 --> 02:14:05.969]  And you stink so bad that we take your stickers and we put them on our checks and envelopes, and every time we mail something out, we make sure everybody knows we support InfoWars.
[02:14:06.289 --> 02:14:06.629]  Thank you.
[02:14:07.909 --> 02:14:12.730]  We also magically, um, they appear on stop signs, too, down here.
[02:14:14.332 --> 02:14:21.697]  But the thing I found most interesting about the speech was the abortion issue as well.
[02:14:23.198 --> 02:14:27.801]  The fact that he said that not securing the border was an immorality.
[02:14:29.322 --> 02:14:34.365]  And his genuine salute to the veterans was very touching.
[02:14:35.185 --> 02:14:36.426]  We really enjoyed that.
[02:14:36.446 --> 02:14:37.047]  That was nice.
[02:14:37.847 --> 02:14:38.928]  Oh yeah, Trump's the real deal.
[02:14:40.109 --> 02:14:41.169]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:43.308 --> 02:14:49.710]  The shifting of Nancy Pelosi with those dentures, I wanted to just slap that bitch right across the mouth.
[02:14:51.070 --> 02:14:52.490]  I'm so sick of her ugly face.
[02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:53.291]  I am too.
[02:14:53.371 --> 02:14:54.171]  God, she's a demon.
[02:14:57.352 --> 02:14:58.572]  I'm glad that God put term limits.
[02:14:58.912 --> 02:15:01.393]  I'm sad my grandmas and grandpas are dead, but you know what?
[02:15:01.473 --> 02:15:02.853]  Death's a term limit on evil people.
[02:15:03.253 --> 02:15:05.534]  And it's a term limit on good people too, but you know, she's got a term limit.
[02:15:05.574 --> 02:15:06.894]  She's got an expiration date.
[02:15:08.214 --> 02:15:08.414]  Yeah.
[02:15:09.415 --> 02:15:09.595]  Yeah.
[02:15:11.618 --> 02:15:13.860]  Did you check out Schumer's evil eyes?
[02:15:14.901 --> 02:15:16.663]  His face looks like a witch mask.
[02:15:16.963 --> 02:15:17.944]  Oh, exactly!
[02:15:18.404 --> 02:15:19.705]  He's flaming evil.
[02:15:20.646 --> 02:15:20.786]  Yeah.
[02:15:21.547 --> 02:15:25.270]  Yeah, he makes me... He probably makes me more... You know that this is from good sources.
[02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:26.932]  His boyfriend is Anthony Weiner.
[02:15:28.733 --> 02:15:29.214]  Seriously!
[02:15:30.415 --> 02:15:31.015]  I believe you!
[02:15:31.954 --> 02:15:33.335]  Nothing surprises me.
[02:15:33.956 --> 02:15:37.658]  Let me finish up with you, Debbie, and then we've got Stuart Rhodes popping in, but he's gonna take calls with us.
[02:15:37.939 --> 02:15:38.499]  He's got a lot to say.
[02:15:38.519 --> 02:15:39.260]  We've got more of these clips.
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:39.940]  You're on fire.
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:41.702]  I want to hear from you and then Judy and others.
[02:15:41.742 --> 02:15:45.324]  Folks, listen, I don't want to get up here with all this dark stuff, but it's going on.
[02:15:45.885 --> 02:15:46.886]  So let's just admit it.
[02:15:47.746 --> 02:15:49.207]  Let's own up to it and let's face it.
[02:15:49.928 --> 02:15:50.388]  Let's do it.
[02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:52.610]  The children are counting on us.
[02:15:53.551 --> 02:15:56.613]  For ourselves, for our children, for us all.
[02:15:57.193 --> 02:15:57.914]  Let's just do it.
[02:15:58.494 --> 02:15:58.995]  Let's commit.

[02:19:02.182 --> 02:19:09.667]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.

[02:20:16.346 --> 02:20:20.307]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:20:21.268 --> 02:20:25.149]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:20:31.835 --> 02:20:39.143]  Coming to you live from the Infowars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[02:20:39.784 --> 02:20:41.986]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:51.414 --> 02:20:54.416]  You know, I really fought with this last night and this morning.
[02:20:54.436 --> 02:20:55.456]  I kept watching the clip.
[02:20:55.496 --> 02:20:56.417]  I mean, I'm not exaggerating.
[02:20:56.457 --> 02:20:57.077]  Fifteen times.
[02:20:57.317 --> 02:20:58.398]  Six, seven times last night.
[02:20:58.438 --> 02:20:59.158]  Ten times this morning.
[02:20:59.678 --> 02:21:01.479]  My wife at breakfast was like, why do you keep watching?
[02:21:01.539 --> 02:21:09.383]  I said, there's something about this clip where Trump defends not killing babies after they're born and the Democrats all boo and get pissed.
[02:21:09.403 --> 02:21:11.504]  I was like, this is the best clip of the night.
[02:21:11.544 --> 02:21:12.125]  And then it hit me.
[02:21:12.205 --> 02:21:13.305]  No, it's the worst clip.
[02:21:13.946 --> 02:21:19.989]  We are so far down the rattle of Satan's whatever it is that now
[02:21:21.326 --> 02:21:24.937]  Saying we shouldn't kill already born babies is rare.
[02:21:27.073 --> 02:21:29.495]  I want to finish up before we go to Stuart Rose, Debbie holding over.
[02:21:29.975 --> 02:21:30.816]  Funny you said that.
[02:21:31.036 --> 02:21:38.622]  Everybody in the studio last night and today said, and I'm not calling for violence against Pelosi, God, never, but they just want to slap the dentures out of her face.
[02:21:38.682 --> 02:21:47.650]  The weird neurotic clicking and everything and then Camilla Harris frowning and shaking her head when we were stopping child kidnappers.
[02:21:47.730 --> 02:21:48.250]  No you're not.
[02:21:49.751 --> 02:21:52.373]  And Alexandria Cortez.
[02:21:53.499 --> 02:21:56.102]  You know, won't clap when we talk about stopping sex slavery?
[02:21:56.142 --> 02:21:58.185]  I mean, these are freakazoids!
[02:21:59.446 --> 02:22:03.831]  And their extremism has gotten so bad that the very worst of them becomes...
[02:22:05.951 --> 02:22:09.692]  The blue ribbon, the pole position, the standard.
[02:22:10.332 --> 02:22:12.552]  So finishing up, Debbie, because you were on fire earlier.
[02:22:12.572 --> 02:22:14.412]  It's not about hating them.
[02:22:14.893 --> 02:22:17.213]  For me, it's about, it's embarrassing.
[02:22:17.273 --> 02:22:22.714]  Like, how do we have a group of people this bad, this evil, this stupid ruling over us?
[02:22:22.974 --> 02:22:24.074]  It makes me feel like crap.
[02:22:25.294 --> 02:22:25.914]  You know what, Alex?
[02:22:25.975 --> 02:22:29.695]  It's because we're on such an elevated plane.
[02:22:29.915 --> 02:22:34.396]  The people who are awake, we're so elevated in this dimension.
[02:22:34.986 --> 02:22:39.728]  That it sickens us and makes us so ill physically.
[02:22:41.249 --> 02:22:50.113]  It's just so hard to look at people like that and want to even be kind to them because they just turn your freaking stomach.
[02:22:51.614 --> 02:23:01.518]  But the other thing I want to say is Cortez, she looks like a rabid Boston Terrier with those bulging eyeballs of hers too.
[02:23:02.058 --> 02:23:03.119]  She really is demonic.
[02:23:04.548 --> 02:23:14.552]  You know we can laugh about her and I do but it's like it's like Beto and that in his fake voice and how corrupt he is it's like this is their superstars?
[02:23:15.313 --> 02:23:21.535]  Beto O'Rourke and Alexandria Cortez these people are idiots and I'm not trying to be mean it's just true!
[02:23:21.555 --> 02:23:30.739]  Yeah yeah no it is it is um Alex I'm gonna let you go but I want to let you know that my husband and I have every t-shirt
[02:23:31.369 --> 02:23:32.550]  Every product.
[02:23:32.850 --> 02:23:33.851]  We give it away.
[02:23:33.991 --> 02:23:34.792]  We gift it.
[02:23:35.192 --> 02:23:36.433]  Because we love you.
[02:23:36.473 --> 02:23:40.056]  We love the Info Warriors and everybody there that works there.
[02:23:40.296 --> 02:23:42.037]  We really think the world of you people.
[02:23:42.838 --> 02:23:47.401]  And I send Reiki to David when he was going for his surgery.
[02:23:47.461 --> 02:23:48.402]  I'm a Reiki master.
[02:23:49.163 --> 02:23:52.085]  And we are also lifetime Oath Keepers.
[02:23:52.245 --> 02:23:53.146]  Thank you, Stuart Rhodes.
[02:23:53.186 --> 02:23:53.586]  We love you.
[02:23:53.646 --> 02:23:53.886]  Thank you.
[02:23:53.906 --> 02:23:54.787]  Well, God bless you, Debbie.
[02:23:54.847 --> 02:23:55.828]  And let me just say this.
[02:23:56.900 --> 02:24:03.593]  I was in meetings this morning with accountants at the lawsuits they've got against us, and we beat like 15 of them, so they filed like five more.
[02:24:03.613 --> 02:24:06.578]  And I was just looking at this, and it was like...
[02:24:07.765 --> 02:24:12.708]  The enemy turns up the heat, you give us product purchases that just meet the level we need.
[02:24:13.109 --> 02:24:14.409]  We need financial support, folks.
[02:24:14.449 --> 02:24:15.130]  We need to send a gift.
[02:24:15.550 --> 02:24:18.152]  I mean, it's insane the attack we're under.
[02:24:18.192 --> 02:24:20.333]  And the fact that we've sustained thanks to you is amazing.
[02:24:20.373 --> 02:24:21.294]  So, thank you all.
[02:24:22.054 --> 02:24:26.217]  Stuart Rose, constitutional lawyer, veteran, founder of Oath Keepers, OathKeepers.org.
[02:24:26.697 --> 02:24:27.598]  So much happening.
[02:24:27.678 --> 02:24:28.659]  Very powerful speech.
[02:24:28.699 --> 02:24:30.400]  I wish he would have gotten into more internet censorship.
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:34.241]  Because this new NAFTA rewrite, you know, obviously gives the tech companies a lot of power.
[02:24:34.622 --> 02:24:36.022]  That'll get negotiated in Congress.
[02:24:36.262 --> 02:24:37.743]  You also worked in Congress for Ron Paul.
[02:24:38.463 --> 02:24:42.164]  But just your overall snapshots, Stuart Rhodes, of what we saw last night.
[02:24:42.204 --> 02:24:47.386]  And then 76% in major polls, even though they're fake polls, that probably means 85%, 90%.
[02:24:47.707 --> 02:24:50.048]  This was a big victory where they actually got to hear the president.
[02:24:50.488 --> 02:24:50.968]  What's your view?
[02:24:52.216 --> 02:24:52.856]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:24:52.896 --> 02:25:01.161]  I think he did very well at presenting himself as a sincere uniter who cares about the American people across the board.
[02:25:01.261 --> 02:25:10.606]  And the prison reform in particular cuts against this false label of him being racist because obviously prison affects so many black people.
[02:25:11.166 --> 02:25:13.107]  As we all know, they tend to go to prison for
[02:25:13.707 --> 02:25:14.287]  Oh, that's a great idea!
[02:25:14.307 --> 02:25:14.647]  Mass pardons!
[02:25:41.525 --> 02:25:42.046]  Absolutely.
[02:25:42.066 --> 02:25:48.814]  It would drive a massive wedge on the left and bring even more people into the walkaway movement, which is what you need.
[02:25:48.834 --> 02:25:53.981]  You need to go out there and find the people who have been brainwashed by the left and conditioned
[02:25:54.531 --> 02:25:55.752]  And find a way to reach them.
[02:25:55.832 --> 02:26:00.914]  And I think drug legalization of marijuana at the federal level, it's a constitutional thing to do.
[02:26:00.974 --> 02:26:03.675]  It's the right policy constitutionally.
[02:26:04.035 --> 02:26:06.056]  Leave it to the states, but it would drive a massive wave of violence.
[02:26:06.076 --> 02:26:08.117]  You've got a lot of points to make, but let me ask you this question.
[02:26:08.377 --> 02:26:09.178]  And he's tried to do that.
[02:26:09.198 --> 02:26:10.478]  He's been blocked by Sessions and others.
[02:26:10.518 --> 02:26:11.299]  Maybe he'll get through now.
[02:26:11.319 --> 02:26:12.259]  But that's common sense.
[02:26:12.319 --> 02:26:12.740]  It makes sense.
[02:26:13.980 --> 02:26:20.385]  Why are the left so tone deaf to shake their head when we're going to free women and sex slavery or children or we're going to stop MS-13?
[02:26:20.405 --> 02:26:22.206]  And the Democrats are so defensive of that.
[02:26:22.607 --> 02:26:30.893]  From my intel, which is not just intel, the left's working with the smugglers, skimming money off all these legalization lawyers, immigration lawyers.
[02:26:31.213 --> 02:26:36.437]  I mean, we're talking about their soldiers, not just Antifa, but the real is MS-13, Mexican mafia.
[02:26:36.717 --> 02:26:37.918]  That's why they're so defensive of it.
[02:26:39.815 --> 02:26:48.280]  You have to differentiate between your average rank-and-file supporter of the left or voter of the Democratic Party and the leadership and the intelligentsia.
[02:26:48.340 --> 02:26:50.301]  Of course, you're never going to reach them.
[02:26:50.341 --> 02:26:51.122]  They're unreachable.
[02:26:51.462 --> 02:26:55.625]  The Cortezes of the world and Bernie Sanders, they're all ideological Marxists.
[02:26:56.105 --> 02:26:58.306]  But the average college student can be reached.
[02:26:58.326 --> 02:27:05.410]  And the one way to reach them is, I think prison reform did a good job, but I would also decriminalize marijuana and set those people free as well.
[02:27:05.811 --> 02:27:07.111]  That would be a massive wedge.
[02:27:07.152 --> 02:27:09.493]  It could be a huge watershed moment.
[02:27:10.635 --> 02:27:11.075]  No, I agree.
[02:27:11.095 --> 02:27:16.616]  I'm just saying, what is wrong with the Democrats to boo when Trump says we don't want to kill babies already born?
[02:27:16.656 --> 02:27:18.656]  I mean, they're even more evil than I thought.
[02:27:18.736 --> 02:27:20.937]  I know they're into this, but now they're out in the open?
[02:27:21.857 --> 02:27:23.057]  Yeah, well, that's the thing.
[02:27:23.157 --> 02:27:33.639]  That's what worries me, is they believe that they have a lock on political power so sure that they can go ahead and take the mask off and show what they really are.
[02:27:34.199 --> 02:27:39.900]  And it must be because they believe that they have successfully outmaneuvered Trump on the immigration issue.
[02:27:40.459 --> 02:27:40.879]  We're good to go.
[02:27:58.849 --> 02:28:00.571]  That's another thing he didn't do last night.
[02:28:00.591 --> 02:28:04.094]  He did pretty decent on talking about the sex slavery.
[02:28:04.434 --> 02:28:13.242]  But really, he should have had a survivor of sex slavery there in the front row, a young female who had been taken here as a child and forced into sex slavery.
[02:28:13.562 --> 02:28:21.029]  And he should have been blunt about what they endure, you know, being forced to being raped by 30 men per day against customers of the cartels.
[02:28:21.409 --> 02:28:23.051]  That's pretty horrific experience.
[02:28:23.091 --> 02:28:24.132]  And so to have that
[02:28:24.648 --> 02:28:31.050]  front and center and having the Democrats sit there silent and not applaud her would have been even a better victory for them.
[02:28:32.090 --> 02:28:36.512]  You know, I demonize Democrats and then sometimes think, oh, no, I can't go far enough.
[02:28:36.552 --> 02:28:38.332]  They are just such scum.
[02:28:39.893 --> 02:28:44.634]  It's like what the other caller said, because we're not into evil.
[02:28:44.674 --> 02:28:46.915]  We just can't even imagine it.
[02:28:46.995 --> 02:28:47.375]  It's like
[02:28:48.427 --> 02:28:49.888]  It took us over a year to develop it.
[02:28:50.348 --> 02:28:51.668]  Thousands and thousands of five-star reviews.
[02:29:09.031 --> 02:29:10.032]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[02:29:10.312 --> 02:29:15.356]  I'm so proud of you and the InfoWars team for all that you do.
[02:29:15.456 --> 02:29:17.098]  I wanted to say I love your product.
[02:29:17.318 --> 02:29:19.640]  The Brain Force Plus is amazing.
[02:29:19.660 --> 02:29:24.924]  Me and my family take it every day and I mean you really can feel what it does.
[02:29:24.944 --> 02:29:33.171]  We were able to develop Brain Force because we went out and looked at what the best-selling nootropics or brain focus energy products were.
[02:29:33.832 --> 02:29:35.613]  And we decided to make it even stronger
[02:29:36.594 --> 02:29:40.378]  And even more high quality and even more organic than leading competitors.
[02:29:40.939 --> 02:29:42.801]  And we've done it with Brain Force Plus.
[02:29:42.881 --> 02:29:47.006]  It is our number one bestseller in gross bottles sold.
[02:29:47.927 --> 02:29:52.331]  Now I made the decision in our marketing to put a lot of product in it and sell it for a low price.
[02:29:52.932 --> 02:29:55.054]  Believing that you're smart, you'll research the market.
[02:29:55.695 --> 02:30:00.317]  Get a great result, know you're getting a great deal, and be routine, continued customers.
[02:30:00.737 --> 02:30:04.278]  I want a long-term relationship with you, and I want a product that I'm proud of that I'm going to use.
[02:30:04.698 --> 02:30:05.939]  It's up there as the very best.
[02:30:06.259 --> 02:30:10.381]  There are nootropics that are $80 a bottle that aren't as good, that have some of the similar ingredients.
[02:30:11.021 --> 02:30:14.002]  But, you know, a doctor sells it at their office, so it must be better.
[02:30:15.142 --> 02:30:21.745]  Ladies and gentlemen, we then stood back and said, what is the number one best-selling thing in the total market globally?
[02:30:22.722 --> 02:30:22.922]  I don't
[02:30:43.206 --> 02:30:49.248]  Top people in the country who has developed some of the other top energy drinks in the nation and in the world.
[02:30:49.668 --> 02:30:53.450]  And they developed TurboForce that is the next level.
[02:30:53.970 --> 02:30:54.910]  Long burn.
[02:30:54.930 --> 02:30:57.131]  A lot of folks up to 10 hours of energy.
[02:30:57.191 --> 02:30:58.231]  Me, 6, 7, 8 hours.
[02:30:58.631 --> 02:30:59.632]  And I take about a half a packet.
[02:30:59.652 --> 02:31:00.172]  It's so strong.
[02:31:00.512 --> 02:31:06.094]  And then it's got all the minerals and all the different amino acids that help deliver the energy into the body.
[02:31:06.840 --> 02:31:20.664]  And that's why I want to thank all the listeners who've been BrainForce fans with 50% off BrainForce, because the two go together to supply yourself and your family with your nootropic with TurboForce, ladies and gentlemen, so you can try it.
[02:31:21.044 --> 02:31:27.866]  It's 33% off, and you get it in the combo, 50% off on BrainForce for a limited time at Inforrestore.com.
[02:31:28.366 --> 02:31:30.967]  One is a pill, one is a packet.
[02:31:31.447 --> 02:31:35.768]  And again, the first time you take TurboForce, I recommend you only take half a packet, because let me tell you,
[02:31:36.798 --> 02:31:40.223]  Folks I know that are totally into energy drinks said they've never seen anything like it.
[02:31:40.583 --> 02:31:42.125]  Most energy drinks hit in 20-30 minutes.
[02:31:42.686 --> 02:31:46.271]  A lot of people get hit in 5 minutes with turbo force.
[02:31:46.732 --> 02:31:51.658]  But again, it doesn't just hit fast, it lasts super, super long because the developers
[02:31:52.759 --> 02:32:00.549]  That we reached out to had the mission of having something that gives you continual clean energy over a long period of time.
[02:32:00.909 --> 02:32:06.116]  So the different compounds that are in this, that synergistically work together, have different burn rates.
[02:32:06.656 --> 02:32:10.041]  Almost like a Saturn rocket's got three different components.
[02:32:11.531 --> 02:32:11.972]  See what I mean?
[02:32:12.232 --> 02:32:20.181]  It launches, you get the main boost phase, then you get up into orbit, that's your next phase, you get to the moon, land on the moon, come back to the Earth.
[02:32:20.561 --> 02:32:24.365]  You've got all those different phases here, ladies and gentlemen, to get you throughout the day.
[02:32:24.786 --> 02:32:25.627]  Boost in the morning!
[02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:31.755]  Continue on through your interstellar day, conquering, exploring, dominating.
[02:32:32.455 --> 02:32:34.637]  And listen, I like to ride my horse and shoot my gun.
[02:32:34.758 --> 02:32:37.640]  You know, a country boy's work is really never done.
[02:32:38.061 --> 02:32:45.287]  And after you put the kids down to bed with the missus there in your arms, you can do a repair job and fix the cable like all good Americans do.
[02:32:45.828 --> 02:32:46.889]  And all thanks to TurboForce.
[02:32:47.509 --> 02:32:52.093]  So again, coming to you, ladies and gentlemen, from the founding system,
[02:32:52.874 --> 02:32:57.116]  Of turbo force and brain force, I bring you this incredible product at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:32:57.336 --> 02:32:58.837]  Get the energy combo today.
[02:32:59.097 --> 02:33:00.657]  Oh, and fund the InfoWars and change the world.
[02:33:00.857 --> 02:33:01.678]  I forgot about that part too.
[02:33:05.879 --> 02:33:08.541]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.539 --> 02:33:25.639]  Big Brother.
[02:33:25.679 --> 02:33:26.919]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:27.440 --> 02:33:28.600]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:29.360 --> 02:33:30.861]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:31.061 --> 02:33:32.221]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:32.721 --> 02:33:37.443]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:55.885 --> 02:33:58.227]  All right, we're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:33:58.247 --> 02:34:01.728]  Stuart Rhodes is our guest, founder of Oath Keepers, constitutional lawyer, patriot, veteran.
[02:34:01.748 --> 02:34:04.990]  I'm going to go to your phone calls now because you're all on the same topic.
[02:34:05.010 --> 02:34:05.711]  We're all here together.
[02:34:05.731 --> 02:34:06.871]  I'm going to host you in the next hour.
[02:34:07.211 --> 02:34:08.552]  Push Roger Stone back 30 minutes.
[02:34:08.592 --> 02:34:09.132]  God bless him.
[02:34:09.653 --> 02:34:11.053]  He knows that's part of hosting the fourth hour.
[02:34:11.073 --> 02:34:11.894]  Sometimes I take over.
[02:34:14.255 --> 02:34:15.536]  I wanted to bring this up to Stuart Rhodes.
[02:34:16.196 --> 02:34:21.099]  Stuart, what did you think was the best part of the speech versus the worst thing?
[02:34:21.139 --> 02:34:26.062]  Because you heard that paradox I got into earlier, where I was like, oh, it's great he defended already-born babies.
[02:34:26.082 --> 02:34:29.925]  But it's like, no, that's really Twilight Zone horrible.
[02:34:31.078 --> 02:34:32.339]  I'm trying to be demoralizing here.
[02:34:32.379 --> 02:34:39.003]  I just think this is pathetic that this guy's embattled because he says don't kill already born babies because they want to get their organs.
[02:34:39.463 --> 02:34:48.369]  They want to set the precedent to keep them alive because again they can parlay out the body parts so they can keep them alive a week or so and get the jets ready and the ice ready and you know make money.
[02:34:49.350 --> 02:34:51.934]  Their argument's like, hey, this baby's worth $500,000, you know?
[02:34:52.675 --> 02:34:57.943]  Let's not just desangriate its blood and collagen for high-end cosmetics for women's lips.
[02:34:58.503 --> 02:35:00.166]  You know, let's get full dollar on this.
[02:35:00.226 --> 02:35:03.951]  But you gotta kill born babies, so they move that bull down the field.
[02:35:05.393 --> 02:35:06.714]  And he should have called them out on that.
[02:35:06.935 --> 02:35:17.605]  We believe he should have been very overt about the money that Planned Parenthood makes and then how they contribute them to the political careers of all these legislators who benefit directly from it.
[02:35:17.985 --> 02:35:19.506]  He should have been very overt about that.
[02:35:20.247 --> 02:35:27.534]  So, you know, I think he did a good job, but I think he could have been more aggressive when it comes to calling them out on the worst of their own agenda.
[02:35:27.574 --> 02:35:28.475]  It's very hard to defend.
[02:35:28.855 --> 02:35:34.277]  I think plenty of people, even on the political left, are starting to wake up because of the overt infanticide.
[02:35:34.317 --> 02:35:34.857]  Well, exactly.
[02:35:35.117 --> 02:35:38.398]  They tried to steal the election from Ted Cruz, who I think is a great guy overall.
[02:35:39.138 --> 02:35:40.859]  I mean, super smart, great patriot.
[02:35:40.879 --> 02:35:43.039]  I mean, compared to Beto O'Rourke, it's like night and day.
[02:35:45.345 --> 02:35:56.531]  The word is, I've talked to so many Hispanic Texans and others, they tried to steal it, they thought they had to steal about 10 points, but so many Hispanics learned that he was for late-term abortion, they just couldn't do it.
[02:35:56.591 --> 02:36:08.458]  I think that's the Achilles heel of the globalists trying to brainwash Hispanics into being leftist, is if we reach out to them and point out, hey, they're the party of killing babies, it's like, you know, even the archetypal Tony Montana of fiction wouldn't kill kids.
[02:36:08.498 --> 02:36:09.218]  No women, no kids.
[02:36:09.238 --> 02:36:12.120]  So I think this is a lie in the sand, like you said.
[02:36:13.097 --> 02:36:13.997]  That's an excellent point.
[02:36:14.877 --> 02:36:17.598]  They're very much culturally conservative.
[02:36:18.318 --> 02:36:23.879]  And, of course, they've been brainwashed and conditioned by the left to think that the left is the only ones that are going to stand up for them.
[02:36:23.899 --> 02:36:25.619]  That's why Beto goes by Beto, right?
[02:36:25.859 --> 02:36:27.360]  He's not even in any part Mexican.
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:28.700]  He's an Irish guy.
[02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:32.201]  But they're doing the identity politics thing, but I think you're absolutely correct.
[02:36:32.561 --> 02:36:37.421]  It's much like the spirit killing turned off a lot of Hispanics, or the spirit, what do they call it?
[02:36:37.722 --> 02:36:39.702]  Spirit cooking, the Alex Jones stuff.
[02:36:40.856 --> 02:36:41.356]  Exactly.
[02:36:41.436 --> 02:36:43.417]  That cost Hillary quite a few votes.
[02:36:43.857 --> 02:36:48.738]  I think the infanticide, in your face, demonic infanticide will do the same thing.
[02:36:48.898 --> 02:36:49.318]  You're right.
[02:36:50.999 --> 02:36:58.781]  Because people say whatever they say in polls, but when people get like, if I vote for killing babies that are already born, I'm in bed with the devil.
[02:36:58.961 --> 02:37:01.162]  I mean, this is, it doesn't get any clearer now, does it?
[02:37:01.962 --> 02:37:02.502]  No, it doesn't.
[02:37:02.542 --> 02:37:03.342]  That's exactly right.
[02:37:03.642 --> 02:37:08.484]  And then you just make that connection and say, look, this is not about, you know, beheading women.
[02:37:08.544 --> 02:37:09.724]  That's why it's so important.
[02:37:10.194 --> 02:37:18.821]  Also to hammer on the fact that tens of thousands of children and young women are brought into this country as sex slaves by the cartels.
[02:37:19.181 --> 02:37:20.002]  Hammer on that.
[02:37:20.462 --> 02:37:22.404]  Educate the American people of the reality.
[02:37:22.524 --> 02:37:22.844]  I agree.
[02:37:22.924 --> 02:37:31.772]  Why do you think Harris and Cortez on video shook their heads and got mad when Trump said we're saving women and sex slavery and children?
[02:37:32.392 --> 02:37:33.773]  I mean, they know the optics.
[02:37:34.474 --> 02:37:35.795]  What are they signaling there?
[02:37:36.667 --> 02:37:41.389]  Well, they're trying to signal this is all bullshit, that that's not true, that somehow Trump is lying.
[02:37:41.409 --> 02:37:43.730]  That's why he needs to have a survivor standing right there.
[02:37:44.110 --> 02:37:45.670]  He needs to explain it and teach them.
[02:37:45.930 --> 02:37:49.572]  It's like Ross Perot had his charts and explained the American people what was coming.
[02:37:49.952 --> 02:37:50.872]  He should be very... No, I agree.
[02:37:50.952 --> 02:37:54.914]  He should have had like 20 women and 10 children that were sex slaves.
[02:37:55.134 --> 02:37:55.954]  It'd have been game over.
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:37:57.400]  Exactly.
[02:37:57.500 --> 02:37:57.941]  Precisely.
[02:37:57.961 --> 02:37:58.601]  That's what he should do.
[02:37:58.941 --> 02:38:00.322]  And the same goes for the cartels.
[02:38:00.702 --> 02:38:03.884]  He needs to educate the American people about the reality.
[02:38:03.904 --> 02:38:11.448]  What he should have done with that is said, look, this is just like when Pancho Villa raided across the American border and killed eight U.S.
[02:38:11.488 --> 02:38:14.890]  soldiers and ten civilians and Wilson responded with the military.
[02:38:15.170 --> 02:38:17.732]  But the cartel now is far worse than Pancho Villa.
[02:38:17.992 --> 02:38:19.473]  They've killed far more Americans.
[02:38:19.753 --> 02:38:22.174]  But educate Americans to our own history.
[02:38:22.454 --> 02:38:27.356]  That it took the US Army on the border, before there was any border patrol, to secure the border.
[02:38:27.376 --> 02:38:28.876]  There are forts all along the border.
[02:38:29.216 --> 02:38:35.199]  And sort of laying the groundwork for his eventual necessity of using the military to secure the border again.
[02:38:35.499 --> 02:38:39.560]  Make sure they understand that cartels are international terrorist organizations.
[02:38:42.438 --> 02:38:43.980]  I agree, but that's why you should have laid the groundwork.
[02:38:44.020 --> 02:38:44.561]  You should have said...
[02:39:02.341 --> 02:39:02.861]  Right, yeah.
[02:39:03.142 --> 02:39:03.682]  Lay it out.
[02:39:03.842 --> 02:39:09.706]  So now he has gotten the Democrats to show their true colors of being obstructionists, not willing to work with them, etc.
[02:39:09.926 --> 02:39:17.832]  And on the 15th, when they refuse again to compromise, he needs to then say, this is why I must do exactly what
[02:39:18.516 --> 02:39:25.098]  President Wilson did in 1916 when he ordered Black Jack Pershing to take it to Pancho Villa and his bandits.
[02:39:25.398 --> 02:39:26.138]  Same thing here.
[02:39:26.378 --> 02:39:28.339]  The cartels are just like Pancho Villa.
[02:39:28.519 --> 02:39:29.359]  In fact, worse.
[02:39:29.639 --> 02:39:30.799]  Far worse than Pancho Villa.
[02:39:30.819 --> 02:39:34.600]  As far as I know, Pancho Villa wasn't sex slaving women and children.
[02:39:34.900 --> 02:39:35.740]  The cartels are.
[02:39:35.980 --> 02:39:37.061]  They are like ISIS.
[02:39:37.101 --> 02:39:37.761]  They are the Western
[02:39:41.024 --> 02:39:41.685]  That's incredible.
[02:39:41.725 --> 02:39:45.249]  We've got to come back and rush through calls here, but since I mentioned it, let's go to a few of these clips.
[02:39:45.910 --> 02:39:48.753]  This Trump slams wealthy politicians for having walls.
[02:39:48.853 --> 02:39:49.334]  Exactly.
[02:39:49.734 --> 02:39:53.818]  It's like having car doors or a screen door on your house.
[02:39:53.879 --> 02:39:56.301]  Of course your country has barriers.
[02:39:56.341 --> 02:39:56.682]  Here it is.
[02:39:57.947 --> 02:40:09.471]  Tonight I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.
[02:40:10.711 --> 02:40:19.974]  No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration.
[02:40:19.994 --> 02:40:21.274]  Don Pelosi is so hard to look at.
[02:40:21.574 --> 02:40:23.455]  Wealthy politicians and donors
[02:40:24.468 --> 02:40:31.530]  Push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.
[02:40:33.570 --> 02:40:35.331]  I mean, a country is about your border.
[02:40:35.631 --> 02:40:38.852]  I mean, that's the first part of a country is, it's ethos and then it's border.
[02:40:39.112 --> 02:40:39.812]  And then it's military.
[02:40:40.692 --> 02:40:44.053]  I just... Look at these Democrats.
[02:40:44.073 --> 02:40:45.113]  I mean, these are demons.
[02:40:45.373 --> 02:40:47.634]  I just... Bunch of criminals.
[02:40:49.571 --> 02:40:56.200]  Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal immigration.
[02:40:57.282 --> 02:41:05.773]  Reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals that are so crowded you can't get in.
[02:41:06.969 --> 02:41:12.011]  Increased crime and a depleted social safety net.
[02:41:12.551 --> 02:41:20.553]  Man, you look at those Democrats, how self-satisfied they look when they know that the globalists have collapsed Latin America and now they're doing it here.
[02:41:21.173 --> 02:41:22.754]  I mean, these are some cold-blooded people.
[02:41:23.094 --> 02:41:24.574]  Here's another clip of the president.
[02:41:24.594 --> 02:41:26.155]  We're not going to get it all in, but...
[02:41:27.555 --> 02:41:31.318]  Southern border security, the victims, it's... I'll go to your calls when we come back.
[02:41:31.358 --> 02:41:31.859]  I apologize.
[02:41:32.499 --> 02:41:35.402]  We're gonna go right to your calls when we come back and we'll do it.
[02:41:35.422 --> 02:41:37.203]  We've got a minute and a half to break.
[02:41:37.504 --> 02:41:38.405]  I'm gonna tell you again.
[02:41:38.645 --> 02:41:39.405]  Oathkeepers.org.
[02:41:39.425 --> 02:41:40.126]  Go get a t-shirt.
[02:41:40.146 --> 02:41:40.907]  Support what Stuart's doing.
[02:41:40.927 --> 02:41:41.747]  He does great work.
[02:41:43.129 --> 02:41:43.629]  InfoWars.
[02:41:44.029 --> 02:41:52.096]  I do not want to make our enemies happy and, you know, I don't really engage in Machiavelli and stuff where I try to, like, calculate everything.
[02:41:52.116 --> 02:41:53.297]  I just go with the truth.
[02:41:54.730 --> 02:41:58.131]  And so there's different thoughts like, well, let the globalists know they're hurting you.
[02:41:58.651 --> 02:41:59.452]  They'll attack more.
[02:41:59.552 --> 02:42:04.193]  But if you don't let the listeners know they're hurting you, then look, I just go with the truth.
[02:42:06.314 --> 02:42:14.917]  We need listeners to understand that they put stories out in the news that I'm worth $500 billion so that no one supports us, OK?
[02:42:15.973 --> 02:42:17.373]  I'm worth $5 million.
[02:42:17.614 --> 02:42:21.575]  And that's the cost of this company that they say I'm valued.
[02:42:21.615 --> 02:42:24.336]  A bunch of equipment and cameras that's almost worthless and I got shut down.
[02:42:24.936 --> 02:42:26.196]  It's all obsolete a year after.
[02:42:27.097 --> 02:42:28.077]  I don't have anything but a house.
[02:42:28.377 --> 02:42:29.257]  I'm not about money.
[02:42:29.337 --> 02:42:31.058]  I'm committed to fighting these people.
[02:42:31.438 --> 02:42:32.098]  And my crew.
[02:42:32.518 --> 02:42:33.419]  And the great work they're doing.
[02:42:33.459 --> 02:42:35.919]  But I need you to buy products and you need them.
[02:42:36.439 --> 02:42:38.300]  And then I can fight the globalists and I can win.
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:42.021]  You are literally the air which we fly through.
[02:42:42.581 --> 02:42:44.062]  Or the water through which we swim.
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:46.700]  We've got the best products.
[02:42:47.180 --> 02:42:49.821]  From the fish oil, to the X3, to all of it.
[02:42:49.861 --> 02:42:50.761]  InfoWars4.com.
[02:42:50.961 --> 02:42:51.942]  I need your financial support.
[02:42:53.122 --> 02:42:54.022]  Sign up for the coffee.
[02:42:54.082 --> 02:42:55.762]  Sign up for all of it.
[02:42:55.902 --> 02:42:56.783]  Get 10% off on auto ship.

[02:42:59.703 --> 02:43:00.544]  InfoWars4.com.
[02:43:04.104 --> 02:43:06.125]  I don't believe the globalists are that smart.
[02:43:09.426 --> 02:43:20.855]  I don't believe you're that stupid that we have this information and that if they shut me down, it's shut down when these pieces of crap are executing this information in front of everybody.
[02:43:20.875 --> 02:43:26.419]  Do you know why there have been layoffs at more than 20 major leftist fake news publications?
[02:43:26.559 --> 02:43:28.900]  From BuzzFeed to Newsweek to Vice.
[02:43:29.081 --> 02:43:30.281]  Why did it all happen this week?
[02:43:30.381 --> 02:43:33.023]  Why didn't it happen a month ago or a month from now?
[02:43:33.164 --> 02:43:34.685]  Why wasn't it doled out?
[02:43:34.865 --> 02:43:37.687]  Because it's uncertain.
[02:43:38.287 --> 02:43:43.371]  It's like a bombing run with a group of bombers flying in and they've all got targets.
[02:43:43.872 --> 02:43:45.893]  And they're all commanded by their HQ.
[02:43:45.913 --> 02:43:48.555]  And by the way, I don't just think that.
[02:43:48.856 --> 02:43:49.916]  I have their blueprint.
[02:43:50.096 --> 02:43:51.317]  I have their bombing run.
[02:43:51.377 --> 02:43:52.779]  I have their attack profile.
[02:43:53.039 --> 02:43:54.480]  I have their Achilles.
[02:43:55.261 --> 02:43:58.123]  And I'm here telling you their Achilles.
[02:43:58.823 --> 02:44:00.685]  I'm here telling you how to defeat them.
[02:44:01.125 --> 02:44:02.846]  Real intelligence is observation.
[02:44:03.967 --> 02:44:05.549]  Real intelligence is infiltration.
[02:44:06.542 --> 02:44:11.589]  Real intelligence is interfacing banging heads with your enemy.
[02:44:12.450 --> 02:44:19.800]  Because you begin to know your enemy better than the enemy knows you.
[02:44:19.820 --> 02:44:21.442]  All real warfare that
[02:44:21.442 --> 02:44:23.184]  What's victorious is psychic.
[02:44:23.344 --> 02:44:29.472]  It can be physical, but that's only to draw out the essence of the enemy's goals and their fears.
[02:44:29.732 --> 02:44:33.958]  And then the commitment to meet your enemy with your goals and your love.
[02:44:34.298 --> 02:44:35.259]  Love trumps all.
[02:44:35.340 --> 02:44:39.965]  But you have to realistically have the template of victory to be able to take it on.
[02:44:40.706 --> 02:44:53.271]  You can't counter a civilizational ending event, a planned viral demolition of humanity, a Earth-ending termination of the birth of a new species, a new vision, a new world.
[02:44:53.491 --> 02:44:57.133]  You can't counter something like that with lack of vision.
[02:44:57.293 --> 02:44:58.954]  Simply countering their program.
[02:44:59.034 --> 02:45:06.937]  You must offer the world that you see and see if others believe in that world and see how they will then offer information to that world.
[02:45:07.897 --> 02:45:10.359]  You have to recruit in a war.
[02:45:10.559 --> 02:45:15.361]  And to do that, you need to look for people that aren't just trying to be in charge of something.
[02:45:15.401 --> 02:45:18.543]  You need to look for people that want to be involved in something.
[02:45:18.663 --> 02:45:20.364]  Involved in something bigger than them.
[02:45:20.704 --> 02:45:23.505]  Not because they want to rule people, but because they love people.
[02:45:23.565 --> 02:45:30.349]  Because they love their ancestors, and they love humanity, and they have a vision that they want to add to in the future.
[02:45:31.849 --> 02:45:34.851]  So that all the victories and the successes of our progeny
[02:45:35.896 --> 02:45:54.470]  When we're the ancestors, when we're long gone, we'll live on through those people in the future, and the incredible challenges they face, and the struggles, and the love, and the passion, and the will, as we become stronger, and stronger, and stronger, but then face greater and greater obstacles as the propulsion system of the future.
[02:45:55.010 --> 02:45:57.012]  And that's why these Satanists fear me so much.
[02:45:57.412 --> 02:46:02.694]  Because they've bet on this planet, and they've bet on their takeover, and they think they're victorious.
[02:46:02.734 --> 02:46:08.796]  And that's why I hate to plug products and the things we sell, but everything we sell is good.
[02:46:09.336 --> 02:46:11.697]  It's the best there is at the price it's at.
[02:46:12.457 --> 02:46:20.760]  And it funds what we're doing that's so fundamentally radical against the spirit of this world that it shakes the enemies of humanity to their very core.
[02:46:21.300 --> 02:46:23.481]  And that's why I know we're going to win in the end.
[02:46:23.581 --> 02:46:48.396]  But I want to ask you to commit, by word of mouth and by prayer, in the public realm and in personal soul, but also in the physical, the energy you expend every day in the system, to transfer part of that to us, to know that there is a full commitment to push our will against the enemy with everything we've got, and to lean in when their knives are stabbing into our guts, to lean into their hate, and just lean in and take it.
[02:46:49.156 --> 02:46:49.596]  I'm ready.
[02:46:49.616 --> 02:46:51.557]  And I'll lean in and I'll take it.
[02:46:51.837 --> 02:46:57.740]  But I need your backing so that when I swing my sword, it'll absolutely devastate the enemy.
[02:46:57.760 --> 02:47:00.962]  And when I raise my shield, it's your will that empowers it.
[02:47:06.885 --> 02:47:09.486]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:20.071 --> 02:47:25.215]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:27.977 --> 02:47:32.600]  The poets tell how Pancho fell.
[02:47:33.621 --> 02:47:36.503]  He left us living in cheap hotels.
[02:47:37.503 --> 02:47:40.365]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold.
[02:47:41.366 --> 02:47:44.208]  And so the story is we're turned cold.
[02:47:45.369 --> 02:47:47.811]  Pancho needs your prayers, it's true.
[02:47:49.264 --> 02:48:06.931]  And now... Stuart Rose, our guest, OathKeepers.org.
[02:48:08.392 --> 02:48:11.633]  Don't forget, the enemy is working around the clock to destroy us.
[02:48:12.694 --> 02:48:15.595]  They believe, metaphysically, that if we can be taken down,
[02:48:17.335 --> 02:48:18.357]  They somehow win.
[02:48:18.897 --> 02:48:19.959]  They want our heads.
[02:48:20.019 --> 02:48:22.262]  They want to mount our standard to their wall.
[02:48:23.083 --> 02:48:29.132]  So I tell you, support InfoWars, because I never intended to be in this position, but we are seen as the standard.
[02:48:29.989 --> 02:48:35.633]  In the fight, we're seen as the scalp to take, the head to chop, the fortress to bring down.
[02:48:36.374 --> 02:48:37.634]  Let's not give the enemy what they want.
[02:48:37.714 --> 02:48:39.436]  At least keep me in the fight a little longer.
[02:48:40.336 --> 02:48:41.237]  Part of me gets tired.
[02:48:41.657 --> 02:48:49.983]  Sometimes they take me out of the game, but then I think about the children, the innocents, and the duty we have to carry this fight on and to have that long stamina.
[02:48:50.403 --> 02:48:51.264]  Stuart Rhodes is our guest.
[02:48:51.284 --> 02:48:52.385]  We're taking phone calls right now.
[02:48:52.465 --> 02:48:55.027]  Judy, in Florida, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:48:55.047 --> 02:48:59.290]  Your take on what's happening with censorship against Christians, conservatives, and what's happening.
[02:48:59.310 --> 02:48:59.570]  Go ahead.
[02:49:00.600 --> 02:49:02.642]  Hi Alex, it's good to speak with you again.
[02:49:03.683 --> 02:49:25.400]  Yes, I was listening during marketing yesterday to Paul Joseph Watson talking to you, and the whole subject of the censorship of conservatives and Christians, just people on the right, has to stop very soon, because I agree with him, Trump will not get elected again.
[02:49:25.945 --> 02:49:30.848]  If we don't have the type of strength in the marketplace we used to be online.
[02:49:32.169 --> 02:49:33.090]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[02:49:33.110 --> 02:49:34.891]  The globalists were arrogant before and ignored us.
[02:49:34.971 --> 02:49:37.333]  But Stewart, that's the question I want to actually raise with you up front.
[02:49:37.373 --> 02:49:38.093]  I'm glad to call her dead.
[02:49:38.513 --> 02:49:41.335]  And stay there, Judy, for a comeback response.
[02:49:41.355 --> 02:49:49.681]  But, I mean, that's Trump's greatest failing is that he's letting them, you know, this new NAFTA deal gives telecoms anything they can do, the big tech.
[02:49:49.901 --> 02:49:51.922]  In that area, he's letting them kill him.
[02:49:52.043 --> 02:49:55.485]  I mean, it's like, as you know, the censorship is just unbelievable.
[02:49:56.621 --> 02:50:00.745]  Yeah, he has not spoken out enough against that, or even at all, as far as I can tell.
[02:50:00.765 --> 02:50:06.290]  You're right, he's the hammer on this suppression, Orwellian suppression of free speech.
[02:50:07.050 --> 02:50:12.535]  He does call them out as fake news, but he needs to go to the other side of the coin, which is just also the censorship.
[02:50:12.555 --> 02:50:15.458]  They're not just lying about the truth, they're stopping the truth.
[02:50:18.895 --> 02:50:20.256]  I mean, you're a constitutional lawyer.
[02:50:20.296 --> 02:50:21.437]  You worked in Congress, Stuart.
[02:50:21.497 --> 02:50:22.979]  What do you think the President should do right now?
[02:50:22.999 --> 02:50:24.040]  I mean, I want antitrust.
[02:50:24.700 --> 02:50:25.941]  They're violating Section 230.
[02:50:26.021 --> 02:50:27.142]  I mean, he's got them.
[02:50:27.182 --> 02:50:27.783]  It's insane.
[02:50:28.483 --> 02:50:29.284]  Yeah, precisely.
[02:50:29.304 --> 02:50:36.330]  I mean, you know, it's the same frustration we have about why are there no prosecutions for the open harboring of illegal aliens.
[02:50:36.370 --> 02:50:39.573]  You can say, well, he's concerned about, you know, political backlash.
[02:50:39.983 --> 02:50:50.025]  When you're going after antitrust, when you're going after clear suppression of free speech and collusion and conspiracy, then I think it's a different story.
[02:50:50.045 --> 02:50:51.746]  You need to go after them for that and hammer on them.
[02:50:52.066 --> 02:50:54.126]  And say, I'm here for free speech for all Americans.
[02:50:54.146 --> 02:50:55.827]  I don't care what your political background is.
[02:50:56.187 --> 02:51:01.988]  And you should make a point of doing the same thing to any right-wing outlets and doing the same kind of stuff if you can find one.
[02:51:02.368 --> 02:51:03.729]  You should be fair about that.
[02:51:03.969 --> 02:51:04.729]  But it needs to happen.
[02:51:06.609 --> 02:51:08.029]  It's a total existential threat.
[02:51:08.069 --> 02:51:09.970]  I mean, it's for all the marbles.
[02:51:10.410 --> 02:51:16.031]  And that's why they work around the clock to shut InfoWars down, because they know the President, when he does see our info, looks into it and responds.
[02:51:16.091 --> 02:51:18.112]  Well, they can't stop you at rallies.
[02:51:18.152 --> 02:51:19.452]  They can't stop you calling Congress.
[02:51:19.772 --> 02:51:21.713]  They can't stop you writing letters to the President.
[02:51:21.753 --> 02:51:23.393]  They can't stop you.
[02:51:23.873 --> 02:51:26.614]  You, folks, it's not, stop saying it's me or Stewart.
[02:51:26.694 --> 02:51:27.334]  It's all of us.
[02:51:27.974 --> 02:51:29.214]  We're all warriors in this fight.
[02:51:30.255 --> 02:51:30.615]  Judy, hang on.
[02:51:30.635 --> 02:51:31.235]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:51:33.655 --> 02:51:35.796]  Put another email to the White House.
[02:51:36.317 --> 02:51:39.599]  Whitehouse.gov forward slash contact.
[02:51:40.020 --> 02:51:50.267]  People should be writing as often as they see fit, because they do have a voice with the president, through email at least, while the stupid government shutdown is still in effect.
[02:51:50.747 --> 02:51:51.268]  Absolutely.
[02:51:51.308 --> 02:51:51.928]  Thank you, Judy.
[02:51:51.968 --> 02:51:54.410]  We're going to go to Andrew in Florida.
[02:51:54.430 --> 02:51:57.993]  Talks about the devil takeover of this earth.
[02:51:59.214 --> 02:52:00.775]  If it isn't the devil running it, it might as well be.
[02:52:00.815 --> 02:52:02.716]  It's just as bad as the archetypal devil I heard about.
[02:52:03.357 --> 02:52:04.798]  So, Andrew, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:52:04.838 --> 02:52:05.078]  Go ahead.
[02:52:07.489 --> 02:52:10.351]  First, I have to plug Patriot Blend Coffee.
[02:52:10.391 --> 02:52:16.396]  Listen, it's so much better than Joe Rogan's Caveman Coffee, let me tell you.
[02:52:16.957 --> 02:52:24.162]  I do not get no heartburn with Patriot Blend, but the reason why I called is the devil really did took over.
[02:52:24.523 --> 02:52:28.386]  Because if you think about it, this goes back to the Georgia Guidestones.
[02:52:28.546 --> 02:52:32.409]  I mean, why do you think they're going with this abortion route?
[02:52:32.489 --> 02:52:34.911]  Because they're trying to depopulize
[02:52:36.567 --> 02:52:37.008]  I don't know.
[02:52:51.487 --> 02:52:51.987]  No, I hear you.
[02:52:52.027 --> 02:52:58.090]  I mean, the whole globalist program is about anti-human, end expansion, end productivity, end the renaissance.
[02:52:58.530 --> 02:53:00.171]  I mean, I don't believe in aliens.
[02:53:00.211 --> 02:53:01.011]  I don't cover aliens.
[02:53:01.091 --> 02:53:04.913]  The globalists act like they're aliens trying to end human expansion.
[02:53:04.933 --> 02:53:07.494]  I mean, if you just sit back and look like, what's going on here?
[02:53:08.074 --> 02:53:10.535]  It's an absolute attack on the species.
[02:53:10.675 --> 02:53:11.595]  Thanks for the call, Andrew.
[02:53:12.555 --> 02:53:13.556]  Your take on that, Stuart Rose?
[02:53:14.787 --> 02:53:15.707]  Well, yeah.
[02:53:15.808 --> 02:53:18.809]  It's really a natural outcome of Marxism.
[02:53:19.129 --> 02:53:20.210]  This is what Marxists are.
[02:53:20.270 --> 02:53:25.573]  They're anti-human, they're anti-nature, they're anti-life, and they're totalitarian.
[02:53:25.773 --> 02:53:27.494]  What's going to come next is going to be euthanasia.
[02:53:27.894 --> 02:53:33.277]  And if they can openly kill children after birth, then they can kill anyone at any stage of life.
[02:53:33.337 --> 02:53:33.797]  And they will.
[02:53:34.177 --> 02:53:34.957]  That's what's coming next.
[02:53:34.977 --> 02:53:37.159]  They're conditioning the American people to accept this.
[02:53:37.639 --> 02:53:38.719]  It's like a game of chicken.
[02:53:38.999 --> 02:53:43.742]  They're saying, hey, now we're going to come out in the open and we're still going to prevail politically.
[02:53:44.082 --> 02:53:51.249]  And if they can successfully prevail politically in New York despite being open advocates of infanticide, then they'll think there's no stopping them.
[02:53:51.529 --> 02:54:01.139]  So we have to stand up and say that this is unacceptable and we have to pressure the President, the Supreme Court to take action to put a stop to it as fast as possible.
[02:54:01.739 --> 02:54:02.120]  That's right.
[02:54:02.160 --> 02:54:05.082]  They want to not let us kill Charlie Manson.
[02:54:06.260 --> 02:54:09.362]  But, who admits he killed people, but, oh, you want to kill a baby?
[02:54:09.522 --> 02:54:10.063]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:54:10.163 --> 02:54:11.784]  It's like, because they can't speak for themselves.
[02:54:12.184 --> 02:54:22.212]  It's like the most bullying, villainous thing you could imagine, and they're... Did you see how excited Governor Cuomo and those Democrats got when they signed the bill to kill kids after they're born?
[02:54:22.612 --> 02:54:24.394]  It was like they were having orgasms.
[02:54:24.994 --> 02:54:26.635]  I mean, because they're Satanists.
[02:54:26.655 --> 02:54:28.697]  It was like, in front of everyone, we're going to kill babies.
[02:54:28.997 --> 02:54:29.637]  Yeah!
[02:54:30.718 --> 02:54:34.642]  It's like Maleficent and the Little Mermaid when she gets the contract.
[02:54:34.702 --> 02:54:39.586]  I mean, it was just like, oh my God, this is like Ted Bundy wasn't this evil.
[02:54:40.945 --> 02:54:43.706]  And the more you can expose it for what it really is, the better.
[02:54:44.086 --> 02:54:53.629]  And I think there's a video out there of a former abortion doctor describing in front of Congress exactly what it looks like for a second-trimester abortion.
[02:54:53.649 --> 02:54:55.329]  It was very graphic, his explanation.
[02:54:55.749 --> 02:54:59.911]  That's what we need to do, is bring out more witnesses to this is the reality of what happens.
[02:54:59.931 --> 02:55:00.711]  We have to humanize.
[02:55:00.731 --> 02:55:01.131]  Here it is.
[02:55:01.151 --> 02:55:02.251]  We have to humanize.
[02:55:02.271 --> 02:55:02.591]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:55:03.772 --> 02:55:04.372]  God Almighty.
[02:55:05.519 --> 02:55:17.923]  I just, Stuart I'll be honest with you, you know, you've been a veteran and a lawyer, worked in Congress, and I've done a lot of stuff in my life, 45 years, but just, like, like, I just don't even get these people.
[02:55:18.043 --> 02:55:22.764]  I don't know how you act like this, why they're so committed to evil, what's wrong with these people?
[02:55:24.008 --> 02:55:25.590]  Well, they have been conditioned as well.
[02:55:25.630 --> 02:55:27.933]  I mean, they've conditioned themselves.
[02:55:28.554 --> 02:55:40.491]  And this has been one of the Left's goals, I think, or at least the leadership, has been to brainwash and condition people, just like any totalitarian society, so that they have a disassociation with reality.
[02:55:40.951 --> 02:55:41.611]  Yeah, they're selfish pigs.
[02:56:03.604 --> 02:56:06.104]  And so, oh, but when they get killed, it's a big deal, though.
[02:56:06.164 --> 02:56:15.066]  And don't they get that, like, they're summoning something that's going to be, because I don't want any violence offensively, but I mean, let's be honest, Stuart, they're really summoning something.
[02:56:15.086 --> 02:56:18.707]  I mean, because what are they going to do when people say, hey, you don't have a life?
[02:56:20.127 --> 02:56:28.188]  Well, I feel like a German in Nazi Germany who is looking and you know, the trains are running, you know, your neighbors being taken to the death camps.
[02:56:28.528 --> 02:56:29.849]  You know, what are you going to do?
[02:56:30.089 --> 02:56:32.169]  Are you going to do like Soros did and turn on your neighbors?
[02:56:32.537 --> 02:56:34.118]  Or are you going to man up and stop it?
[02:56:34.399 --> 02:56:35.380]  That's kind of where we're at.
[02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:41.625]  And this is starting to get to the pushing point where not only do they not deny it, but we can't deny it.
[02:56:41.645 --> 02:56:44.948]  What do we do when children are being murdered right there in our own country?
[02:56:44.968 --> 02:56:46.049]  We just sit back a little longer?
[02:56:46.069 --> 02:56:47.871]  If we don't take action, we now become accomplices.
[02:56:48.863 --> 02:56:49.384]  Exactly.
[02:56:49.684 --> 02:56:52.328]  So I think Trump needs to take the spearhead.
[02:56:52.348 --> 02:56:58.456]  He did a little bit last night, pretty good work on it, but he really needs to hammer, and he needs to ask the Supreme Court to put a stop to it.
[02:56:58.476 --> 02:56:59.677]  He needs to do an emergency petition.
[02:56:59.697 --> 02:57:06.586]  I agree, because whatever you want to call it, the left has gone completely insane, and they're taking it, I think, on purpose.
[02:57:07.467 --> 02:57:12.068]  They're taking us to a point of no return, and they just want that physical conflict.
[02:57:12.108 --> 02:57:14.388]  And then once it happens, they are going to squeal and beg.
[02:57:14.488 --> 02:57:22.850]  And I don't want to be like this, folks, but once things kick off, if they do, we can show no mercy, because no mercy was shown to these children.
[02:57:23.430 --> 02:57:24.810]  Stuart Rhodes, I really appreciate you.
[02:57:24.830 --> 02:57:25.590]  Okeepers.org.
[02:57:25.670 --> 02:57:26.010]  Thank you.
[02:57:27.071 --> 02:57:27.371]  Thank you.
[02:57:27.391 --> 02:57:27.731]  God bless.
[02:57:29.271 --> 02:57:33.732]  Do you agree with my point about, though, if they, at a certain point, like, they didn't give the children mercy?
[02:57:35.067 --> 02:57:43.797]  Well, we have to always be Christian in our response, but you can still fight the future enemies, as we did with Nazi Germany, or any of the other totalitarian regimes.
[02:57:43.837 --> 02:57:45.059]  But they're going to beg, though.
[02:57:46.981 --> 02:57:47.842]  Well, put them on trial.
[02:57:47.862 --> 02:57:49.504]  They should be tried for crimes against humanity.
[02:57:49.524 --> 02:57:49.664]  Exactly.
[02:57:49.684 --> 02:57:50.926]  Put their asses on trial.
[02:57:52.697 --> 02:58:00.065]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[02:58:00.686 --> 02:58:06.512]  And a lot of times we reach out to top companies, and they don't want to private label to us because, well, we're InfoWars and we've been demonized.
[02:58:06.552 --> 02:58:10.876]  But a lot of times, people will work with us only because we're InfoWars.
[02:58:11.457 --> 02:58:12.899]  Well, there is a national company
[02:58:13.419 --> 02:58:27.067]  And I'm not going to name them because we're not in competition with them, but we private label the product who has FDA approval for years to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there until you get to prescription level of wound gel that can be sold in stores.
[02:58:27.707 --> 02:58:34.531]  And we private label it and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[02:58:35.151 --> 02:58:36.772]  But the announcement here today is this.
[02:58:37.472 --> 02:58:40.954]  We've been selling a lot of the womb shell and a lot of the immune guard.
[02:58:41.394 --> 02:58:43.696]  In fact, we just put in big orders for both of them.
[02:58:44.456 --> 02:58:55.182]  But then I noticed, without us even plugging it, because of all the scary stuff going on this winter with viruses and bacteria spreading at record levels, that it was all flying off the shelves at regular price.
[02:58:55.862 --> 02:59:10.791]  And so unlike other companies and other groups that do things like raise prices during a crisis, we're going to go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at EnforcedLife.com and EnforcedTour.com.
[02:59:11.251 --> 02:59:12.152]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:59:12.492 --> 02:59:16.414]  We're going to go to 40% off because I just put a big order in.
[02:59:16.434 --> 02:59:22.358]  It'll be a few months till more comes in, but I want you to have the impetus and the initiative to get it for yourself and your family.
[02:59:23.138 --> 02:59:26.501]  Get a great discount, see how great it works, and become a repeat customer.
[02:59:26.761 --> 02:59:31.445]  It's just as a Texan, and as American, and as a patriot, that's how I want to be treated.
[02:59:31.945 --> 02:59:39.211]  That when there's a crisis, if people really need something and want it, I'm gonna sell it at a huge discount instead of selling it at full price because I noticed you were buying it.
[02:59:39.571 --> 02:59:50.100]  So because you're supporting us and already buying it, both the products, 40% off as a combo, or 40% off individually, while supplies last, at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:59:55.069 --> 02:59:59.191]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.711 --> 03:00:01.032]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:07.555 --> 03:00:13.597]  Something's happening here.
[03:00:13.877 --> 03:00:16.098]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[03:00:16.578 --> 03:00:19.060]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:00:19.540 --> 03:00:21.881]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.240 --> 03:00:31.545]  All right, Brad and Rudy, we're going to you here in a final segment with Stuart Rose and then Joe Rogan in studio.
[03:00:32.346 --> 03:00:34.067]  Big satire warning, obviously.
[03:00:34.547 --> 03:00:35.388]  Not Joe.
[03:00:36.268 --> 03:00:38.510]  But I'm so cool, he called me last night and answered the phone.
[03:00:39.150 --> 03:00:42.252]  But that's coming up because it's about the globalist's next weapon against America.
[03:00:42.272 --> 03:00:42.873]  We've got to cover it.
[03:00:43.633 --> 03:00:45.194]  Stuart Rose of Oath Keepers is our guest.
[03:00:46.415 --> 03:00:48.176]  Let's go ahead and go to Brad in Pennsylvania.
[03:00:48.196 --> 03:00:49.237]  Brad, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:00:50.256 --> 03:00:52.657]  Thanks, Alex, and happy early birthday to you.
[03:00:52.678 --> 03:00:55.419]  I love everything you do.
[03:00:55.599 --> 03:00:57.220]  You're awesome.
[03:00:57.340 --> 03:01:01.363]  Anybody who hates on you, just let it go, including Joe Rogan.
[03:01:01.423 --> 03:01:13.870]  I know you're a fighter, and I don't blame you for standing up against any kind of illegitimate stuff like that, but don't waste your time on it because it's not productive.
[03:01:13.890 --> 03:01:14.731]  That's just my feeling.
[03:01:16.098 --> 03:01:17.539]  No, I mean, I tend to agree with you.
[03:01:17.579 --> 03:01:21.301]  He just becomes like Jack Dorsey wants the global currency to be Bitcoin.
[03:01:21.321 --> 03:01:24.182]  He controls with this cashless thing he's rolling out.
[03:01:24.723 --> 03:01:28.505]  And then they're not telling you that they're violating SEC rules when they're doing it.
[03:01:28.545 --> 03:01:31.927]  So it's just like the more I looked, I was like, gosh, this is way worse than I thought.
[03:01:31.947 --> 03:01:32.487]  You see what I'm saying?
[03:01:34.017 --> 03:01:34.858]  I know where you're coming from.
[03:01:35.138 --> 03:01:40.881]  I've been listening to you for 15 years at least, so I know exactly what you're thinking most of the time, and I'm right on board with everything.
[03:01:40.901 --> 03:01:48.404]  Well yeah, I feel guilty that I kind of halfway knew and ignored it for like a decade, and so now I'm just trying to catch up.
[03:01:48.584 --> 03:01:50.625]  I don't know how to explain it.
[03:01:51.346 --> 03:01:53.267]  No, and hey, your son pointed it out.
[03:01:53.707 --> 03:01:56.848]  Once Rex did that, I'm sure I fired you up.
[03:01:56.908 --> 03:01:57.449]  I don't blame you.
[03:01:58.169 --> 03:02:01.671]  And it was my son who said, get behind Trump, when he first announced.
[03:02:02.796 --> 03:02:07.501]  Hey, your son and your dad are the best, man, and I'm right there with you.
[03:02:07.521 --> 03:02:11.405]  When Mueller comes after you and your dad, that is BS, and everybody knows it.
[03:02:11.565 --> 03:02:13.027]  He knows your dad's problem.
[03:02:13.047 --> 03:02:18.233]  I gotta say, there's something so powerful that my son and my dad are with me in this, and it's just like three generations.
[03:02:18.313 --> 03:02:19.274]  It's powerful.
[03:02:20.330 --> 03:02:24.753]  God bless you, your dad, your son, and your girls, Alex, because that's where it all comes from, family.
[03:02:25.774 --> 03:02:34.720]  Not if anybody who doesn't have kids doesn't understand, because I'm sure some of them can, but when you have kids and you have a family, you're right, man.
[03:02:34.740 --> 03:02:39.844]  It's a whole different level of feeling and understanding, and that's how you know.
[03:02:39.864 --> 03:02:41.925]  I used to be Democrat.
[03:02:41.945 --> 03:02:47.789]  I was raised Catholic, but then I went to the other side because I was earthly, worldly.
[03:02:50.626 --> 03:03:06.808]  I sowed my wild oats, but then I came back around and after listening to you and coming to my senses in the last 10-15 years, I'm conservative now and glad I am and I feel so much better about my life, about where I am, but I feel for people who are turned over to evil and we need to pray for everybody.
[03:03:07.745 --> 03:03:15.374]  Especially all the good people out there who need our help because the times, these are end times it seems like and I'm not, I don't know.
[03:03:15.394 --> 03:03:16.175]  No, you're right Brad.
[03:03:16.215 --> 03:03:17.317]  Beautiful things you've said.
[03:03:17.357 --> 03:03:17.877]  God bless you.
[03:03:18.338 --> 03:03:20.861]  Stuart Rhodes, closing comments on what Brad just said.
[03:03:20.901 --> 03:03:21.862]  I mean, this is what it's all about.
[03:03:21.882 --> 03:03:23.404]  I know you've got a lot of children as well.
[03:03:23.464 --> 03:03:27.209]  I mean, they give you incredible strength because then they really invest you.
[03:03:28.851 --> 03:03:30.111]  Well, yeah, and this is our duty.
[03:03:30.511 --> 03:03:31.332]  It's not about us.
[03:03:31.372 --> 03:03:32.812]  We're only here for a short time.
[03:03:33.212 --> 03:03:34.872]  But it's about our children and grandchildren.
[03:03:34.892 --> 03:03:40.453]  I mean, if you don't defend your family, you don't defend the children of your country, then what good are you?
[03:03:40.493 --> 03:03:44.594]  That's the most basic and primal imperative, especially of us men.
[03:03:44.614 --> 03:03:50.576]  As warriors, we need to be able to be willing and able to defend our own people and defend our own territory.
[03:03:51.096 --> 03:03:52.516]  It's a primal situation.
[03:03:52.536 --> 03:03:54.236]  Why do so many men think it's cool to sell out?
[03:03:54.256 --> 03:03:55.617]  They think they're smart doing it.
[03:03:56.057 --> 03:03:57.337]  And I just want to strangle them.
[03:03:58.720 --> 03:04:03.642]  Well, they'd be conditioned to believe that their own manhood is somehow caustic and dangerous.
[03:04:04.042 --> 03:04:10.424]  In fact, Jordan Peterson's got a pretty good article out about this right now, about how the psychiatric association is attacking manhood.
[03:04:10.884 --> 03:04:12.104]  And it's very blatant and clear.
[03:04:12.124 --> 03:04:13.685]  He just came out and said masculinity's evil.
[03:04:14.642 --> 03:04:17.464]  Yeah, you know, and the reason why is they can't control you.
[03:04:17.984 --> 03:04:24.829]  I think it was that kickboxer Anthony, what's his name, just talked about this as well, it's on our Twitter page.
[03:04:24.849 --> 03:04:30.812]  They want to stop masculinity because they fear men as warriors because they know we can stop them.
[03:04:31.153 --> 03:04:34.415]  They know that we will stop them, so they want to neuter us and get rid of men.
[03:04:34.455 --> 03:04:37.597]  It's a classic military attack, take out the military.
[03:04:38.537 --> 03:04:40.639]  Take out the warrior class, yeah, absolutely right.
[03:04:44.286 --> 03:04:44.647]  All right.
[03:04:45.767 --> 03:04:46.447]  Thank you, Stuart Rose.
[03:04:46.467 --> 03:04:47.148]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:04:47.168 --> 03:04:47.648]  God bless you.
[03:04:48.348 --> 03:04:48.768]  You too, Brad.
[03:04:48.928 --> 03:04:49.429]  God bless, brother.
[03:04:49.849 --> 03:04:55.191]  More calls coming up, and I got this little piece coming up.
[03:04:56.732 --> 03:04:58.432]  I'll try to have some fun with it as best I can.
[03:04:58.452 --> 03:04:58.873]  Straight ahead.
[03:04:58.893 --> 03:04:59.353]  Stay with us.
[03:05:03.929 --> 03:05:11.274]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[03:05:11.614 --> 03:05:24.783]  Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there, and we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[03:05:24.983 --> 03:05:29.546]  We also have another product, also produced by the same company, Immune Gargle.
[03:05:29.886 --> 03:05:33.389]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle.
[03:05:34.049 --> 03:05:42.673]  We're going to go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:05:43.153 --> 03:05:45.494]  This is a limited-time Immune Boost Special.
[03:05:45.914 --> 03:05:52.597]  Get Super Blue, Silver Immune Gargle, and Super Silver Wound Dressing for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:05:53.117 --> 03:05:56.078]  Again, this is a limited-time Immune Boost Special.
[03:05:56.258 --> 03:06:02.761]  Get Super Blue, Silver Immune Gargle, and Super Silver Wound Dressing for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:06:10.746 --> 03:06:15.689]  Boys and girls take warning if you go near the lake.
[03:06:17.210 --> 03:06:22.154]  Keep your eyes wide open and look for sneaky snakes.
[03:06:23.422 --> 03:06:28.644]  Now maybe you won't see him, and maybe you won't hear.
[03:06:29.864 --> 03:06:35.547]  But he'll sneak up behind you, and drink all of your root beer.
[03:06:35.747 --> 03:06:41.929]  And then Sneaky Snake goes dancing, wiggling and a-hissing.
[03:06:42.829 --> 03:06:49.611]  Sneaky Snake goes dancing, a-gigglin' and a-kissin'.
[03:06:49.631 --> 03:06:54.652]  I don't like old Sneaky Snake, he laughs too much, you see.
[03:06:55.673 --> 03:07:00.934]  When he goes a-wigglin' through the grass, it tickles his underneath.
[03:07:03.491 --> 03:07:10.234]  Well, Sneaky Snake drinks root beer, and he just makes me sick.
[03:07:10.314 --> 03:07:14.656]  When he is not dancing, he looks just like a stick.
[03:07:16.522 --> 03:07:21.887]  Now he doesn't have any arms or legs, you cannot see his ears.
[03:07:22.888 --> 03:07:28.254]  And while we are not looking, he's stealing all of our beer.
[03:07:28.854 --> 03:07:34.961]  And then Sneaky Snake goes dancing, a wiggling and a hissing.
[03:07:36.319 --> 03:07:40.562]  Now that's Tom T. Hall bringing us in with Sneaky Snake.
[03:07:40.622 --> 03:07:47.406]  And we're trying to decide whether the Joe Rogan theme song should be Tom T. Hall's Sneaky Snake, or can we play Snake Farm?
[03:07:48.107 --> 03:07:49.908]  Which is another, we gotta play this.
[03:07:50.148 --> 03:07:55.571]  And again, the reason I want Joe Rogan is, I went and looked at his sponsors, it's like,
[03:07:57.111 --> 03:08:07.757]  All these Jack Dorsey companies, Twitter, and he doesn't tell people it's that, and it's like George Soros stuff, and then he's on air, like George Soros talking points every day, and then saying Alex Jones is lying.
[03:08:09.398 --> 03:08:14.901]  I'm not giving out any George Soros talking points, but Media Matters says Alex Jones did this.
[03:08:14.981 --> 03:08:16.522]  That's literally George Soros.
[03:08:17.594 --> 03:08:21.196]  So I realize the way they're pushing him and all this, that CNN has no viewers.
[03:08:21.296 --> 03:08:24.157]  Joe has 10 million viewers average podcast.
[03:08:24.537 --> 03:08:27.138]  Bigger podcast like the one I was on, 45-50 million people.
[03:08:28.299 --> 03:08:35.042]  So he's not the platform I am, and then he wants to sit there while I'm tied up in the corner, they think.
[03:08:35.542 --> 03:08:36.483]  We're still reaching a lot of people.
[03:08:37.694 --> 03:08:41.137]  Those that really count, those that are tuned in and really care, he tries to shut me down.
[03:08:41.237 --> 03:08:43.818]  So, Joe, this is not satire.
[03:08:43.838 --> 03:08:45.560]  Joe did call me last night a couple times.
[03:08:45.580 --> 03:08:49.843]  I had the phone off and got the messages in the morning.
[03:08:51.064 --> 03:08:52.665]  And I don't really think there's anything for me to talk about.
[03:08:54.146 --> 03:08:56.828]  You know, Joe's like, I apologized to you yesterday.
[03:08:56.848 --> 03:09:03.913]  If I hurt your feelings or didn't have you on, but you're in a bad place and you're mentally ill.
[03:09:06.772 --> 03:09:07.993]  And I don't even have time to watch it all.
[03:09:08.013 --> 03:09:09.314]  I guess he's done hours on this.
[03:09:09.374 --> 03:09:11.936]  But he's like, yeah, Jones is insane.
[03:09:11.976 --> 03:09:17.261]  He claims Jimmy Savelle had sex with dead kids at hospitals and ate their brains.
[03:09:18.182 --> 03:09:19.723]  Dude, that's London Telegraph.
[03:09:19.923 --> 03:09:21.865]  That's BBC.
[03:09:21.885 --> 03:09:25.408]  In fact, just type in Jimmy Savelle, sex with dead children.
[03:09:25.608 --> 03:09:27.670]  There's the Washington Post.
[03:09:27.730 --> 03:09:28.811]  And the Washington Post is whitewashing.
[03:09:28.831 --> 03:09:29.251]  It was alleged.
[03:09:29.291 --> 03:09:30.272]  No, it was confirmed.
[03:09:31.393 --> 03:09:33.895]  So look, and he goes, Jones is a schizophrenic.
[03:09:36.843 --> 03:09:46.428]  Really, I've been around 45 years and started a media operation that nobody could challenge and, you know, I have no criminal record and I know how to tie my shoelaces, you know.
[03:09:46.848 --> 03:09:49.309]  I'm pretty, pretty, I can walk the line.
[03:09:51.230 --> 03:09:52.231]  I mean, I used to mountain climb.
[03:09:52.251 --> 03:09:54.852]  I could sit there and like be 500 feet up with like one arm hanging off.
[03:09:54.872 --> 03:09:56.213]  Pretty, pretty, pretty cool dude.
[03:09:56.233 --> 03:09:59.875]  You know, I'm not like, I'm not scared.
[03:09:59.895 --> 03:10:01.976]  I'm not a schizophrenic on a street corner.
[03:10:02.716 --> 03:10:04.177]  Jimmy Chavelle
[03:10:05.831 --> 03:10:10.434]  Would take children and lay out plastic all over the floor and then slit their throats ear to ear.
[03:10:10.834 --> 03:10:12.595]  And it came out in the news, Joe.
[03:10:12.615 --> 03:10:16.657]  And if you're a radio listener, I'm showing ABC News.
[03:10:17.077 --> 03:10:20.699]  He committed sex acts on dead bodies while volunteering in a hospital.
[03:10:21.099 --> 03:10:25.522]  And if you read the police reports, they would eat the pituitary gland.
[03:10:27.398 --> 03:10:31.299]  Well you think, like Joe goes, God, he's an incredible writer though.
[03:10:31.699 --> 03:10:34.120]  He comes up with amazing stuff better than Stephen King.
[03:10:34.460 --> 03:10:36.540]  No dude, I didn't come up with any of it!
[03:10:37.660 --> 03:10:42.902]  I didn't come up with Cortez booing Trump when he said we were going to stop sex slavery.
[03:10:43.562 --> 03:10:48.203]  I didn't come up with him saying we keep babies alive and take their organs on TV, man.
[03:10:49.023 --> 03:10:49.943]  The governor of Virginia.
[03:10:50.563 --> 03:10:52.304]  I got freaked out about it, Joe Joe.
[03:10:53.430 --> 03:11:01.439]  So you sit there and maybe you're out there in your LA cocoon with your head up your culo.
[03:11:02.921 --> 03:11:06.084]  But I mean, dude, I don't just say this stuff.
[03:11:06.525 --> 03:11:12.271]  They want me off the air to shut down the exposure of what they're into.
[03:11:12.632 --> 03:11:14.194]  It's an anti-child devil cult.
[03:11:15.523 --> 03:11:36.282]  When I learned that it was in witchy leagues, the devil worship, the human sacrifice, the pedophilia, the Aleister Crowley stuff, and then the media just diverted onto a pizza place, I was like, oh my god, the pizza place is a diversion, like a mockingbird saying it's wings broken, nothing, and then, oh, there's no pedophilia in the world, Jones admits he's fake, we can't have him on air.
[03:11:36.542 --> 03:11:38.684]  Joe, I don't want on your stupid show, dude.
[03:11:40.126 --> 03:11:41.107]  I produce loose change.
[03:11:42.366 --> 03:11:48.450]  That before they put the view counter down, had 187 million views on Google Video.
[03:11:48.470 --> 03:11:50.012]  187 million views, Joe.
[03:11:51.513 --> 03:11:54.875]  Back when you were eating donkey testicles on Fear Factor.
[03:11:56.696 --> 03:12:03.041]  And I made all these other films, hundreds of millions of views, billions and billions of views that were, I don't, oh, oh, please have me on!
[03:12:03.421 --> 03:12:04.642]  Please, Joe!
[03:12:04.862 --> 03:12:08.725]  He's like, Joe's like, we may have you on if you're good and sit down and you're good.
[03:12:09.205 --> 03:12:10.286]  Oh, let me sit then.
[03:12:10.506 --> 03:12:11.307]  Do I get a treat?
[03:12:13.183 --> 03:12:14.703]  Dude, you weren't on my radar.
[03:12:15.103 --> 03:12:18.644]  When you pulled all this, you went... Tracking radar.
[03:12:19.244 --> 03:12:19.925]  Enemy assessed.
[03:12:20.485 --> 03:12:21.465]  Targeting operations.
[03:12:22.205 --> 03:12:23.365]  Enemy propaganda vehicle.
[03:12:24.166 --> 03:12:25.406]  Destroy with extreme prejudice.
[03:12:27.766 --> 03:12:30.047]  Like, you just... Literally, you just got the program.
[03:12:30.067 --> 03:12:31.967]  Like, it's like... Destroy.
[03:12:33.208 --> 03:12:33.668]  Headquarters.
[03:12:34.388 --> 03:12:34.848]  Destroy.
[03:12:34.948 --> 03:12:35.188]  Enemy.
[03:12:35.768 --> 03:12:36.388]  Key enemy.
[03:12:36.869 --> 03:12:40.609]  Maximum... Commitment.
[03:12:41.210 --> 03:12:41.830]  Prime target.
[03:12:42.370 --> 03:12:42.610]  Attack.
[03:12:43.991 --> 03:12:47.112]  Because, you see, it's not just that you're on the higher echelon of evil.
[03:12:47.552 --> 03:12:48.332]  You're almost there.
[03:12:48.712 --> 03:12:50.833]  But you are a good pickets.
[03:12:51.913 --> 03:12:53.254]  You're cleared to fire, Joe.
[03:12:54.394 --> 03:12:56.654]  What that means is you're dead in my sights, son.
[03:12:57.855 --> 03:13:02.216]  So this isn't about men acting tough to men and me scaring you and all of those things.
[03:13:02.256 --> 03:13:08.238]  You need to know, as a sneaky snake, what I'm going to do.
[03:13:08.418 --> 03:13:13.219]  So, I joked around earlier and I said Joe Rogan is going to be on the show today.
[03:13:15.302 --> 03:13:16.442]  And then, of course, I said it was satire.
[03:13:16.482 --> 03:13:19.164]  He'll spin it and say, Alex lied and said I'd be on.
[03:13:19.604 --> 03:13:20.204]  I wasn't.
[03:13:20.364 --> 03:13:21.004]  It's a lie.
[03:13:21.404 --> 03:13:22.265]  But you won't show the clip.
[03:13:22.285 --> 03:13:25.806]  Because that's what sneaky snakes do.
[03:13:26.766 --> 03:13:30.808]  So if you're a TV viewer, ladies and gentlemen, Joe Rogan is now in studio with us.
[03:13:31.648 --> 03:13:33.729]  And let's do a document cam shot closer here, please.
[03:13:34.229 --> 03:13:35.010]  He's going to be interviewed.
[03:13:35.050 --> 03:13:39.491]  So it's like, hey, George Soros was on 60 Minutes and said he supported the Nazis.
[03:13:40.252 --> 03:13:40.972]  No, he didn't.
[03:13:41.392 --> 03:13:43.053]  George Soros cut Hitler's head off.
[03:13:44.241 --> 03:13:45.562]  I'm a sneaky snake!
[03:13:46.063 --> 03:13:47.424]  I mean, this is, this is what it is.
[03:13:47.464 --> 03:13:48.445]  Because here's the deal.
[03:13:48.905 --> 03:13:57.332]  If you pay Joe enough money, if your cash square and Jack Dorsey, which is all confirmed, it's all over the news now, the insider trading investigation is going on.
[03:13:58.133 --> 03:14:03.738]  If you pay him, like you put coins into the snake, then the snake does whatever you want.
[03:14:03.998 --> 03:14:04.118]  Oh!
[03:14:04.919 --> 03:14:05.659]  Thanks, Alex!
[03:14:07.301 --> 03:14:07.741]  Oh yeah!
[03:14:08.402 --> 03:14:09.543]  I'm a sneaky snake now!
[03:14:10.569 --> 03:14:16.354]  So, again, if you're a TV viewer, this is a not really Joe Rogan, this is a... So that'll be the headline tonight.
[03:14:16.574 --> 03:14:18.816]  Alex Jones claimed Joe Rogan was on.
[03:14:19.657 --> 03:14:20.678]  He really wasn't on.
[03:14:20.738 --> 03:14:22.620]  Jones engaged in incredible fake news.
[03:14:25.362 --> 03:14:26.543]  So, do we have Snake Farm queued up?
[03:14:28.725 --> 03:14:30.227]  Alright, let's go out to break with Snake Farm.
[03:14:31.588 --> 03:14:34.651]  I like the other song, but I think this is actually Joe's official song.
[03:14:35.703 --> 03:14:43.260]  And so, uh, Joe, Joe, Joe thought that, you know, he was with the establishment and I didn't see what he was doing, but Joe...
[03:14:47.045 --> 03:14:47.745]  What was happening?
[03:14:48.686 --> 03:14:49.907]  Jiu Jitsu master.
[03:14:51.328 --> 03:14:56.411]  I don't think the Jiu Jitsu master understood what was happening.
[03:14:56.471 --> 03:15:01.054]  So, when we come back, we're going to get to Sneaky Snake.
[03:15:01.774 --> 03:15:07.878]  But the good news is, seriously, new men's attire, 2020 apparel is going to be this.
[03:15:07.918 --> 03:15:09.339]  Like, forget the boa.
[03:15:09.419 --> 03:15:11.981]  I mean, this is like absolutely incredible.
[03:15:13.482 --> 03:15:16.926]  When we come back, I'll get serious and take more of your phone calls than Roger Stone is going to take over.
[03:15:19.017 --> 03:15:20.418]  I mean, I just had to talk about this.
[03:15:20.478 --> 03:15:23.380]  I just had to do this because I can't keep track of everything.
[03:15:23.400 --> 03:15:25.241]  And my listeners were mad at me about Joe Rogan.
[03:15:25.541 --> 03:15:26.922]  Like, aren't you hearing what he's doing?
[03:15:26.982 --> 03:15:27.283]  Aren't you?
[03:15:27.303 --> 03:15:29.604]  And I was like, no, I'm busy doing stuff.
[03:15:29.644 --> 03:15:30.325]  I've only got 20 years.
[03:15:30.885 --> 03:15:33.307]  And then I just, I see his responses back.
[03:15:33.667 --> 03:15:34.768]  I see the disinfo.
[03:15:36.909 --> 03:15:44.134]  Yeah, so I mean, Joe Rogan's experience is brought to you by Snake Farm Insurance.
[03:15:45.532 --> 03:15:53.994]  And if you want your country burned down, and pedophiles have sex with your kids, and Jack Dorsey to run a world currency, where if he's a bitch about it, he takes it away from you, then you're all about the Snake Farm.
[03:15:54.754 --> 03:15:55.474]  Snake Farm!
[03:15:56.835 --> 03:15:57.775]  This is Joe with your child.
[03:15:57.795 --> 03:15:59.995]  Ramona's got a keen sense of humor.
[03:16:00.015 --> 03:16:08.517]  She got her tattoos down, her arm... Wars are like 12-round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[03:16:09.718 --> 03:16:14.479]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the damage.
[03:16:15.632 --> 03:16:16.473]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[03:16:17.234 --> 03:16:17.694]  We stopped her.
[03:16:17.734 --> 03:16:18.655]  We got a nationalist in.
[03:16:19.916 --> 03:16:21.978]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[03:16:22.118 --> 03:16:23.039]  We are winning.
[03:16:23.880 --> 03:16:28.924]  But those of us who are at the very front line, the tip of the spear, are under unprecedented attack.
[03:16:29.405 --> 03:16:34.449]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[03:16:34.489 --> 03:16:35.610]  This is about who wants it most.
[03:16:37.034 --> 03:16:40.137]  You know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors, they've taken everything.
[03:16:40.577 --> 03:16:42.078]  I am in your hands, you are in my hands.
[03:16:42.699 --> 03:16:45.341]  I need financial support, and I got products you and your family need.

[03:19:12.566 --> 03:19:20.968]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:19:21.569 --> 03:19:31.411]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[03:19:45.516 --> 03:19:49.859]  And it comes in easy to use packets to mix it with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:19:50.540 --> 03:19:51.981]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.

[03:19:53.522 --> 03:19:59.687]  So take a half pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:20:00.208 --> 03:20:01.989]  TurboForce at MForceLife.com.
[03:20:06.253 --> 03:20:08.895]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.237 --> 03:20:15.199]  First out, the Snake Farm.
[03:20:15.439 --> 03:20:18.242]  Snake Farm, it just sounds nasty.
[03:20:18.262 --> 03:20:20.905]  Snake Farm, it pretty much is.
[03:20:21.065 --> 03:20:23.688]  Snake Farm, it's a reptile house.
[03:20:23.708 --> 03:20:24.509]  Snake Farm.
[03:20:37.412 --> 03:20:39.734]  Ramona's got a keen sense of humor.
[03:20:40.094 --> 03:20:42.095]  She got a tattoo down her arm.
[03:20:42.155 --> 03:20:43.416]  It's of a python.
[03:20:43.536 --> 03:20:45.037]  Eating a little mouse.
[03:20:45.137 --> 03:20:47.598]  Wearing a set of hats that says, Snake Farm.
[03:20:47.798 --> 03:20:48.899]  Snake Farm.
[03:20:49.019 --> 03:20:50.560]  It just sounds nasty.
[03:20:50.580 --> 03:20:51.660]  Snake Farm.
[03:20:51.760 --> 03:20:54.282]  It pretty much is Snake Farm.
[03:20:54.342 --> 03:20:56.343]  You know, people ask, why are you?
[03:20:56.363 --> 03:20:59.565]  That's one of the never-ending fights on such a Joe Rogan check right now.
[03:21:01.284 --> 03:21:05.186]  And, you know, again, it's like, it's the condescension of Joe.
[03:21:05.987 --> 03:21:08.168]  Like, Joe, oh, I'm sorry, Alex.
[03:21:08.428 --> 03:21:09.249]  I want to be your friend.
[03:21:09.269 --> 03:21:12.411]  You know, maybe you can come on the show.
[03:21:12.951 --> 03:21:14.432]  Just be nice and stop.
[03:21:15.192 --> 03:21:18.574]  Dude, I didn't start attacking you because I wanted to get on your stupid show.
[03:21:19.275 --> 03:21:24.438]  You know how many times I've turned down 40 million in Bitcoin and a million a month in Bitcoin.
[03:21:24.498 --> 03:21:27.860]  And, you know, it's like, what planet are you on?
[03:21:30.794 --> 03:21:31.795]  Not for sale, man!
[03:21:33.176 --> 03:21:34.096]  You see my ass right here?
[03:21:36.258 --> 03:21:36.758]  You see this?
[03:21:36.998 --> 03:21:39.500]  I've never broke it or sold it out to anybody.
[03:21:41.341 --> 03:21:44.643]  To quote Tony Montana, there's two things I don't break.
[03:21:45.804 --> 03:21:47.185]  And that's my word and my balls.
[03:21:48.666 --> 03:21:52.388]  And so, Joe's this new Silicon Valley darling.
[03:21:54.109 --> 03:21:56.111]  Because they've compromised him, I don't know what.
[03:21:57.383 --> 03:21:58.603]  And then he misrepresents everything.
[03:21:58.643 --> 03:22:00.364]  He's like, we'll go back to your calls.
[03:22:00.864 --> 03:22:04.765]  Alex Jones says I'm in the CIA and he's a liar.
[03:22:05.685 --> 03:22:08.066]  Joe, I didn't say you were in the CIA.
[03:22:08.506 --> 03:22:11.967]  I said the entire group around you pushing DMT and ayahuasca.
[03:22:12.327 --> 03:22:13.288]  You can look up their names.
[03:22:13.328 --> 03:22:17.949]  They're involved in DARPA and major research projects of the CIA on record.
[03:22:18.269 --> 03:22:19.329]  We bibliographed all that.
[03:22:19.389 --> 03:22:21.270]  So don't change the subject, Joe.
[03:22:26.403 --> 03:22:28.223]  And then he gets into his next big lie.
[03:22:28.704 --> 03:22:29.644]  And his next big lie.
[03:22:30.364 --> 03:22:30.444]  Oh!
[03:22:31.544 --> 03:22:33.005]  Alex lied about me.
[03:22:33.785 --> 03:22:37.686]  He said that my family got threatened a few years ago and that's why I sold out.
[03:22:38.286 --> 03:22:39.326]  But that never happened.
[03:22:40.607 --> 03:22:42.407]  And you know, in that, there's a kernel of truth.
[03:22:44.748 --> 03:22:49.569]  Because Eddie Bravo at dinner a couple years ago, after I'd already been on Joe's podcast, was like,
[03:22:52.321 --> 03:22:53.522]  I'll tell you, I think he got threatened.
[03:22:53.562 --> 03:22:54.143]  He got threatened.
[03:22:54.183 --> 03:22:55.864]  And he hangs out with these professors and these weirdos.
[03:22:55.884 --> 03:22:59.267]  So I go in there and I say, you know, I think Joe's family's been threatened.
[03:22:59.287 --> 03:23:01.589]  And he goes, oh, my family didn't get threatened.
[03:23:01.629 --> 03:23:01.909]  No, no, no.
[03:23:02.109 --> 03:23:04.431]  And I'm like, OK, Eddie Bravo didn't say they got threatened.
[03:23:05.051 --> 03:23:07.854]  Eddie says it's that he thought you got threatened.
[03:23:08.874 --> 03:23:10.616]  And that turns into this whole thing about
[03:23:12.452 --> 03:23:13.933]  I don't have Alex on.
[03:23:14.533 --> 03:23:19.555]  Alex isn't the captain of the football team, or Alex isn't the class president.
[03:23:20.156 --> 03:23:27.979]  Alex isn't invited to wear the sweater over his shoulders and tie it together, a little ascot, because he's a liar.
[03:23:32.401 --> 03:23:33.702]  I'm gonna explain this to you again, Joe.
[03:23:35.143 --> 03:23:39.925]  I'm not coming after you because you didn't have me on your stupid podcast.
[03:23:42.834 --> 03:23:44.179]  Like, I've already been on everything.
[03:23:44.801 --> 03:23:45.343]  It's a joke.
[03:23:46.025 --> 03:23:47.430]  I'm pissed at you.
[03:23:50.888 --> 03:23:55.472]  Because when I started looking into you, when people said, why are you leaving this guy alone?
[03:23:55.892 --> 03:23:59.956]  And I was like, everywhere I looked, there's like all, it's like, I go, let me spot check this.
[03:24:00.076 --> 03:24:01.037]  Oh my God, that's the worst.
[03:24:01.377 --> 03:24:04.300]  Oh my God, that's like, I look over here like, oh, that's even worse.
[03:24:04.800 --> 03:24:06.041]  I go, let me just randomly check over here.
[03:24:06.662 --> 03:24:07.723]  Oh my gosh, it's even worse.
[03:24:07.783 --> 03:24:11.386]  It's like, I like zoom in just to spot check what you're up to.
[03:24:11.986 --> 03:24:18.272]  And every time I tune in, it's like the, it's like the Satan channel or something.
[03:24:19.366 --> 03:24:22.489]  And I don't mean the Satan channel, like hot cheerleaders and shooting guns.
[03:24:22.789 --> 03:24:23.130]  Woo!
[03:24:23.170 --> 03:24:23.670]  Woo!
[03:24:23.690 --> 03:24:23.750]  Woo!
[03:24:24.751 --> 03:24:26.373]  No, that's what the devil would have you believe.
[03:24:26.393 --> 03:24:27.734]  That's God's channel.
[03:24:27.754 --> 03:24:32.378]  God's channel is like women and kids and life and spaceships and awesome crap and everything.
[03:24:32.398 --> 03:24:34.280]  And like, you know, the devil's like, oh, I did that.
[03:24:34.580 --> 03:24:35.081]  I did that.
[03:24:35.601 --> 03:24:37.803]  I gave you your wife or your husband.
[03:24:38.264 --> 03:24:39.465]  I'm the author of all those good things.
[03:24:40.987 --> 03:24:42.248]  That's what's frustrating about this.
[03:24:44.477 --> 03:24:46.779]  Is that I don't want to be in LA.
[03:24:46.799 --> 03:24:48.541]  I don't want to be part of the system.
[03:24:49.281 --> 03:24:53.885]  And then there's this one person I know is part of it for whatever weird twist of fate over 20 years.
[03:24:55.167 --> 03:25:00.792]  And then, you know, I witnessed stuff from Joe that I would never even say on air.
[03:25:02.613 --> 03:25:04.695]  That is just, it's just outrageous.
[03:25:06.837 --> 03:25:08.879]  I mean, no wonder Joe doesn't have a lot of people around him.
[03:25:09.855 --> 03:25:15.138]  Because if you get close to Joe, I mean, you actually get in a hotel room with him at 6am in Las Vegas, you know.
[03:25:16.479 --> 03:25:17.680]  It's a little something different.
[03:25:18.700 --> 03:25:20.942]  And you know, me, I'm like, hey, well, you know.
[03:25:22.983 --> 03:25:23.783]  Here's the deal, son.
[03:25:26.943 --> 03:25:29.184]  You know, I don't think I'm going to be able to stop and not say all this stuff.
[03:25:29.484 --> 03:25:29.884]  You know what?
[03:25:30.724 --> 03:25:31.404]  Here's the problem.
[03:25:31.464 --> 03:25:32.364]  Here's the reason I've held back.
[03:25:33.025 --> 03:25:37.106]  If you go buy a Christmas turkey you're going to cook, you've got to cook it right.
[03:25:37.166 --> 03:25:37.586]  You know what I mean?
[03:25:37.606 --> 03:25:39.746]  It's kind of like having some presentation to it.
[03:25:40.526 --> 03:25:45.208]  There's got to be some presentation to the cooking of the turkey and everything else.
[03:25:45.388 --> 03:25:50.169]  And so... Here it is.
[03:25:54.108 --> 03:25:59.510]  You think I want to be part of your system when I want to burn you down.
[03:26:00.531 --> 03:26:02.172]  And your bosses have figured that out.
[03:26:02.252 --> 03:26:03.852]  Like, Alex Jones is not for sale.
[03:26:06.573 --> 03:26:08.494]  It's already sold out.
[03:26:09.315 --> 03:26:12.076]  I signed on to the big command base, right?
[03:26:12.276 --> 03:26:12.776]  Oh my God.
[03:26:13.656 --> 03:26:14.397]  I'm signed on to that.
[03:26:14.417 --> 03:26:15.537]  I'm just lucky I made the cut.
[03:26:15.717 --> 03:26:18.418]  I mean, I'm brushed up against people like you so much.
[03:26:18.459 --> 03:26:19.979]  I can't believe I'm dirty rags.
[03:26:20.059 --> 03:26:21.400]  I can't believe God even accepts me.
[03:26:22.279 --> 03:26:23.501]  I'm really lucky to be on the team.
[03:26:23.521 --> 03:26:24.462]  Let me just tell you that.
[03:26:24.923 --> 03:26:31.111]  And I'm counting on it every moment that God says, you attack these people and you take it to them all the way.
[03:26:31.571 --> 03:26:32.933]  Maybe I let you be with us.
[03:26:33.534 --> 03:26:34.615]  I'm like, yes, sir.
[03:26:35.785 --> 03:26:36.806]  Please take full control of me.
[03:26:36.826 --> 03:26:37.786]  And God goes, I don't do that.
[03:26:38.787 --> 03:26:39.808]  You're going to have to do this.
[03:26:39.848 --> 03:26:40.508]  I'm just like, okay.
[03:26:41.429 --> 03:26:48.594]  So you're all trying to take DMT and get in contact with little floating retard demons from the pit of hell.
[03:26:49.435 --> 03:26:54.538]  And I just want you to know, Joe, that there's a whole nother dimension and then on from that.
[03:26:54.678 --> 03:26:57.220]  And you're just not making the cut, Joe.
[03:26:58.781 --> 03:27:02.684]  I mean, do you really think at higher dimensions, you see Joe Rogan walking around?
[03:27:07.861 --> 03:27:10.604]  You know, maybe he's got platform shoes that'll go up to the next dimension.
[03:27:11.044 --> 03:27:11.705]  Like elevators.
[03:27:13.286 --> 03:27:17.511]  I mean, when you're walking around heaven on a big command base and you're like, oh my god, I wish I'd known this.
[03:27:17.531 --> 03:27:18.792]  You're like, yeah, get in the field.
[03:27:18.812 --> 03:27:20.133]  We're gonna have a huge attack coming in.
[03:27:20.474 --> 03:27:23.817]  I mean, imagine when you get to the next level and you're like, oh my god, I know what it was.
[03:27:24.297 --> 03:27:24.578]  Oh, yeah.
[03:27:27.170 --> 03:27:32.511]  Can you imagine, like, looking back on Hollywood, looking back on these losers, and looking back, it's going to be a joke.
[03:27:32.531 --> 03:27:34.892]  We're going to say, that almost defeated us?
[03:27:35.432 --> 03:27:37.133]  That's what we almost sold out to?
[03:27:37.433 --> 03:27:43.354]  Like, like bugs to a bug zapper flying out to Los Angeles to, bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz.
[03:27:43.834 --> 03:27:48.155]  So if we all present our butt to the devil properly, he might decide to mount us.
[03:27:48.175 --> 03:27:54.097]  There you go.
[03:27:55.458 --> 03:27:57.460]  You know, Mueller and all these guys take themselves so seriously.
[03:27:57.501 --> 03:27:58.642]  There you go.
[03:27:59.643 --> 03:28:01.245]  Can't even do it properly.
[03:28:01.285 --> 03:28:03.408]  It's like, everything's backwards.
[03:28:03.488 --> 03:28:05.050]  A little treat.
[03:28:05.871 --> 03:28:09.395]  So, this is all about defiling their gods.
[03:28:10.496 --> 03:28:12.158]  It's all about burning bridges.
[03:28:13.393 --> 03:28:16.616]  Because God wants us to... Oh, I know, there's no God.
[03:28:16.956 --> 03:28:20.820]  The first message of the devil worshipper is, there is no God, because they don't want you to know there's an escape.
[03:28:21.320 --> 03:28:22.562]  They don't want you to know there's a bridge.
[03:28:22.582 --> 03:28:26.926]  They don't want to know there's this whole beautiful thing right there, like, oh, it doesn't exist, there's no hope.
[03:28:26.986 --> 03:28:28.107]  No, there is nothing but hope.
[03:28:30.299 --> 03:28:33.921]  But the devil tells you there's no God, and then sneaks up so he can pretend it's God.
[03:28:34.362 --> 03:28:36.143]  You have to accept God.
[03:28:36.183 --> 03:28:44.589]  You have to say, God, I'm weak, but I love you, and I want free will, and I have free will, and I want you to come in and take control.
[03:28:45.549 --> 03:28:47.510]  And I want to then carry out the mission.
[03:28:48.371 --> 03:28:54.655]  Not to get a bigger house or a jet airplane, but to engage people like this at point-blank range.
[03:28:56.536 --> 03:28:59.979]  I'll take a few final calls and Roger Stone takes over.
[03:29:06.060 --> 03:29:09.201]  When we go off to war.
[03:29:09.521 --> 03:29:11.342]  When we exercise our rights.
[03:29:14.283 --> 03:29:16.384]  When we soar to our greatest heights.
[03:29:18.945 --> 03:29:20.545]  When we mourn and pray.
[03:29:23.566 --> 03:29:25.207]  When our neighbors are at risk.
[03:29:27.307 --> 03:29:29.308]  When our nation is threatened.
[03:29:31.184 --> 03:29:34.607]  There's someone to gather the facts.
[03:29:35.428 --> 03:29:36.409]  To bring you the story.
[03:29:39.091 --> 03:29:40.172]  No matter the cost.
[03:29:42.695 --> 03:29:46.118]  This is why so many people can't stand the mainstream media.
[03:29:46.538 --> 03:29:48.280]  Because knowing empowers us.
[03:29:50.022 --> 03:29:51.723]  Knowing helps us decide.
[03:29:53.285 --> 03:29:55.507]  Knowing keeps us free.
[03:30:04.761 --> 03:30:07.443]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[03:30:07.783 --> 03:30:13.687]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.

[03:32:56.417 --> 03:32:59.602]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.080 --> 03:33:26.840]  Alright, here's the deal.
[03:33:26.920 --> 03:33:32.282]  I've tried to go to all your calls, and Roger Stone's got some stuff to cover.
[03:33:32.302 --> 03:33:44.806]  He'll be on The War Room coming up today as well, but I can tell you right now that we got banned off 22 Facebook pages yesterday, and I looked these up.
[03:33:44.846 --> 03:33:45.826]  These weren't even our pages.
[03:33:47.546 --> 03:33:49.287]  And they said, oh, it's recidivism.
[03:33:50.356 --> 03:33:51.636]  Like, it's a thought crime.
[03:33:51.656 --> 03:33:59.039]  It actually says, people promoting Alex Jones, and some pages have like a half million followers, 300,000, 200,000, 100,000 followers.
[03:33:59.439 --> 03:34:00.359]  Millions all together.
[03:34:00.379 --> 03:34:04.200]  And I'm just like, the media's calling up, Melania, your pages got taken down!
[03:34:05.061 --> 03:34:09.262]  And I'm like, I went and talked to our people that are in social media.
[03:34:09.302 --> 03:34:11.903]  They go, no, two of them, we had fans that ran that we knew.
[03:34:11.923 --> 03:34:14.784]  One of them had like a half million, another 200,000.
[03:34:15.184 --> 03:34:18.765]  But imagine using the term recidivism.
[03:34:20.461 --> 03:34:21.381]  Recidivism.
[03:34:22.661 --> 03:34:28.142]  That means like I robbed a bank when I was 20 and I got out of prison when I'm 35 and I go rob a bank again.
[03:34:29.203 --> 03:34:32.523]  Or I'm a child molester and I've raped two kids and I go to jail and I get back out.
[03:34:33.163 --> 03:34:34.863]  The recidivism policy.
[03:34:34.964 --> 03:34:35.184]  Yes.
[03:34:35.744 --> 03:34:35.924]  So.
[03:34:36.524 --> 03:34:38.244]  And they just do this to get a bunch of headlines.
[03:34:38.324 --> 03:34:41.285]  It's like we get less than 1% of our traffic from Facebook.
[03:34:41.905 --> 03:34:42.545]  It's dead.
[03:34:44.065 --> 03:34:45.725]  And then they're like articles everywhere.
[03:34:45.805 --> 03:34:46.365]  Get him off.
[03:34:46.385 --> 03:34:46.666]  Get him off.
[03:34:46.886 --> 03:34:49.146]  You know a year ago it was like oh because he did something.
[03:34:53.519 --> 03:34:56.860]  Now they just go, he isn't allowed to be on the internet.
[03:34:58.481 --> 03:35:02.943]  So, I've said this about 5,000 times and I'll say it again for listeners.
[03:35:04.063 --> 03:35:05.584]  This isn't regular talk radio.
[03:35:05.604 --> 03:35:06.645]  It isn't regular TV.
[03:35:06.705 --> 03:35:08.265]  It's not regular stuff.
[03:35:08.825 --> 03:35:14.148]  It's toe-to-toe with the globalists, relaunching capitalism, Americana, pro-Christian society.
[03:35:15.688 --> 03:35:17.029]  And we're under major attack.
[03:35:18.007 --> 03:35:23.251]  And I can tell you right now that we didn't expand the shows last year like I intended.
[03:35:24.252 --> 03:35:25.333]  We didn't launch all the new stuff.
[03:35:27.175 --> 03:35:29.016]  I'll just tell Roger in front of God and Country.
[03:35:29.737 --> 03:35:30.918]  I already told Paul this two days ago.
[03:35:31.158 --> 03:35:33.600]  Paul and Roger Stone are on the chopping block.
[03:35:34.421 --> 03:35:35.262]  The money's not there.
[03:35:35.962 --> 03:35:39.105]  Money's not coming in to pay some of our employees.
[03:35:40.486 --> 03:35:41.707]  And I thought about this a lot.
[03:35:41.747 --> 03:35:43.408]  It'll give the enemy a lot of excitement.
[03:35:44.930 --> 03:35:46.071]  No crap you're getting to us.
[03:35:47.233 --> 03:35:48.855]  My God, you already took most of our bank accounts away.
[03:35:48.875 --> 03:35:50.156]  We can't advertise online.
[03:35:50.776 --> 03:35:51.697]  All we've got is the listeners.
[03:35:52.658 --> 03:35:54.300]  People say, well, we don't want to bet on a loser.
[03:35:54.600 --> 03:35:56.282]  Well, then you just bet on yourself being a loser.
[03:35:56.602 --> 03:35:59.965]  Because InfoWars is a standard in the fight.
[03:36:00.886 --> 03:36:08.394]  It's seen as a symbol, a signet, a logo, a archetype that must be brought down.
[03:36:13.268 --> 03:36:17.150]  You know, a sick side of me has been in the fight 24 years on air.
[03:36:18.791 --> 03:36:25.494]  And a sick side of me is just like, the responsibility of like, I get up earlier in the morning easier than I ever did.
[03:36:25.514 --> 03:36:28.455]  And you're a kid, you can't get out of bed now.
[03:36:28.475 --> 03:36:29.796]  It's like, I just get up because there's a mission.
[03:36:30.476 --> 03:36:32.657]  I'll be laying in bed, I'll be like, ah, this bed feels incredible, I gotta fight to get up.
[03:36:32.677 --> 03:36:33.978]  You know, you're right on my back.
[03:36:34.058 --> 03:36:36.819]  And so all I'm telling listeners is, in me, you've got
[03:36:38.243 --> 03:36:44.825]  A AI attack robot, made of flesh and blood, that is completely committed to fighting the globalists.
[03:36:45.605 --> 03:36:46.706]  But I need fuel.
[03:36:48.226 --> 03:36:57.789]  In the spectrum of media and systems, if you don't put fuel in the jet tank, I can't drop bombs on George Soros.
[03:37:01.138 --> 03:37:05.199]  I mean, I'll be stuck on the tarmac fantasizing about dropping bombs till the day I die.
[03:37:05.799 --> 03:37:10.101]  But I want to drop weapons, information weapons, not violent weapons.
[03:37:11.541 --> 03:37:17.283]  I want to engage and engage and engage and engage and engage until the cows come home.
[03:37:17.323 --> 03:37:21.684]  But I need, we already have great products you need.
[03:37:21.705 --> 03:37:22.505]  We already have brain force.
[03:37:25.461 --> 03:37:27.244]  Turbo Force, the new product.
[03:37:27.264 --> 03:37:27.744]  50% off.
[03:37:27.764 --> 03:37:28.525]  Big special one right now.
[03:37:28.866 --> 03:37:30.047]  We already have Ultimate Brown Broth.
[03:37:30.067 --> 03:37:31.369]  We already have Super Silver.
[03:37:31.750 --> 03:37:33.252]  No one got the private label of this.
[03:37:33.612 --> 03:37:34.674]  It's $40 in stores.
[03:37:34.714 --> 03:37:35.575]  It's FDA approved.
[03:37:35.835 --> 03:37:37.718]  It's the most weaponized silver on the planet.
[03:37:38.499 --> 03:37:40.582]  Below the level that the same company sells as a prescription.
[03:37:43.226 --> 03:37:44.788]  So I need everybody to go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:37:44.808 --> 03:37:47.691]  I need everybody to go there and just realize that it's a war.
[03:37:47.971 --> 03:37:52.676]  Just find your war bonds and get the toothpaste, get the coffee, get it all, and just take action.
[03:37:52.996 --> 03:37:58.362]  I'm going to let Roger take over here because I'm going to go to some meetings and I'm sorry to the callers we didn't get to, but I tried my best.
[03:37:58.382 --> 03:37:59.063]  Call me back tomorrow.
[03:38:00.084 --> 03:38:05.670]  It's just that, you know, you think the team that's like, let's not kill babies after they're born would be winning.
[03:38:06.715 --> 03:38:08.696]  But the media's like, Trump was evil to even say that.
[03:38:08.736 --> 03:38:24.523]  So I'm kind of like, I'm not a fatalist, but you know, if humanity thinks it's normal to have medical doctors that are governors on TV saying, we kill babies after they're born, then I'm not going to throw the towel in, but it's kind of like, you've made your choice.
[03:38:27.584 --> 03:38:30.125]  And again, you can say Texas is Southern.
[03:38:30.185 --> 03:38:30.886]  I love Southerners.
[03:38:31.960 --> 03:38:41.605]  There's a certain type of Southerner, in fact, cue it up, replay it, who's like a fake Southerner who, like, gets into it all effeminate, like, Oh, just go to sleep while I slit your throat.
[03:38:42.346 --> 03:38:44.147]  It'll keep the baby comfortable.
[03:38:44.567 --> 03:38:48.729]  And we don't ask the women, women won't, any women.
[03:38:49.230 --> 03:38:50.430]  It's for the women.
[03:38:50.490 --> 03:38:52.651]  No, they're selling the organs.
[03:38:53.612 --> 03:38:56.193]  And these women, like cult members, sit there looking at him.
[03:38:56.474 --> 03:38:58.655]  These are sick freaks, man.
[03:38:59.275 --> 03:39:00.436]  And we can't beat them?
[03:39:02.088 --> 03:39:07.629]  Our president is extreme because he doesn't want to kill babies after they're born?
[03:39:07.670 --> 03:39:13.191]  Then, you know, at a certain point... They want to demoralize us.
[03:39:13.211 --> 03:39:14.151]  They want to make us give up.
[03:39:14.211 --> 03:39:14.711]  It's what they want.
[03:39:14.731 --> 03:39:16.032]  But here, let's play that clip.
[03:39:16.532 --> 03:39:20.193]  Of the governor with his mint julep.
[03:39:20.253 --> 03:39:20.613]  Here it is.
[03:39:21.497 --> 03:39:30.844]  Um, there are, you know, when we talk about third trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother, with the consent.
[03:39:30.864 --> 03:39:31.564]  Hey boss, back it up.
[03:39:31.664 --> 03:39:39.010]  What if the, what if the, what if the, I don't want any violence, I'm just, apathetically, what if the doctors said, let's tie him up with piano wire?
[03:39:39.830 --> 03:39:42.954]  And then, like, slowly use loppers to cut his toes off.
[03:39:43.575 --> 03:39:46.358]  Like, oh, the doctors had a consensus.
[03:39:46.939 --> 03:39:56.150]  We're gonna hang you up by your toes, Governor, and we're gonna slit your throat, but not before we cut your fingers off with pruning loppers.
[03:39:57.469 --> 03:40:00.311]  Oh, it'd be like, oh my God, this is horrible, this is a human being, don't do it.
[03:40:00.351 --> 03:40:07.074]  But he's, he's going, um, we keep the baby comfortable.
[03:40:07.154 --> 03:40:10.576]  And his pants, like, he's having a, I mean, this is a demon.
[03:40:10.856 --> 03:40:11.196]  I'm sorry.
[03:40:11.997 --> 03:40:13.097]  And I don't wish any harm upon him.
[03:40:13.117 --> 03:40:19.561]  I'm saying, like, what if the hospital said, hang Governor Northup up, and then feed him into a wood chipper.
[03:40:19.581 --> 03:40:24.303]  We like, well, the hospital said, go, let's not get the government involved.
[03:40:24.423 --> 03:40:25.064]  So here's the governor.
[03:40:26.514 --> 03:40:38.902]  There are, you know, when we talk about third trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother, with the consent of the physicians, more than one physician, by the way.
[03:40:39.522 --> 03:40:45.886]  And it's done in cases where there may be severe deformities, there may be a fetus that's non-viable.
[03:40:45.926 --> 03:40:47.027]  There may be, there may be.
[03:40:47.227 --> 03:40:53.511]  No, they want to keep kids alive with dumb, young, poor mothers to get the organs because they keep them alive a week or so, they can sell them at higher prices.
[03:40:54.532 --> 03:40:58.594]  By the way, by the way, go back to by the way.
[03:40:58.614 --> 03:40:59.434]  Here we go.
[03:40:59.935 --> 03:41:01.855]  A fetus that's non-buyable.
[03:41:02.356 --> 03:41:07.918]  So in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen.
[03:41:08.738 --> 03:41:10.079]  The infant would be delivered.
[03:41:10.619 --> 03:41:10.699]  Yes.
[03:41:29.665 --> 03:41:34.928]  And so Trump says, killing babies after they're born is wrong, and then Cortez and everybody gets upset.
[03:41:53.314 --> 03:41:56.258]  So, Roger Stone takes over, and I appreciate him holding on while I do this today.
[03:41:56.699 --> 03:41:57.921]  He'll take over next segment.
[03:41:58.442 --> 03:42:01.947]  I just, at a certain point, I don't know what to say anymore.
[03:42:02.708 --> 03:42:04.891]  I mean, if this effeminate trollop
[03:42:05.658 --> 03:42:19.502]  This chicken neck with a weird little mullet that like goes down his neck and he's all, yeah, yeah, and then the baby and then the side and he's like a big grotesque spider with these dumb ass women sitting there.
[03:42:19.522 --> 03:42:20.523]  Look at those dumb asses.
[03:42:21.243 --> 03:42:23.323]  I mean, it's just like, good God.
[03:42:24.884 --> 03:42:29.305]  He's literally like this spider, like he's a, he's actually a pediatric surgeon.
[03:42:29.685 --> 03:42:30.586]  He's an organ harvester.
[03:42:30.606 --> 03:42:31.186]  That's his job.
[03:42:32.253 --> 03:42:35.855]  And he's just like, we're gonna get them baby's goodlies.
[03:42:36.435 --> 03:42:38.116]  Gonna get them baby's chitlins.
[03:42:38.697 --> 03:42:40.938]  Gonna get all them little smacky goods.
[03:42:41.038 --> 03:42:42.999]  And you know what's wrong?
[03:42:43.059 --> 03:42:44.640]  Keep that baby comfortable.
[03:42:45.461 --> 03:42:48.002]  Gonna take good care of that baby.
[03:42:48.862 --> 03:42:51.784]  When I'm not wearing my KKK outfit.
[03:42:52.825 --> 03:42:54.766]  I love my KKK.
[03:42:55.246 --> 03:42:56.087]  I'm governor.
[03:42:56.607 --> 03:42:58.188]  I'm governor Norfolk.
[03:42:58.808 --> 03:43:00.549]  I'm big man now.
[03:43:01.189 --> 03:43:01.690]  I'm big.
[03:43:03.544 --> 03:43:15.851]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[03:43:16.972 --> 03:43:28.019]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[03:43:29.326 --> 03:43:30.971]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[03:43:31.252 --> 03:43:33.920]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[03:43:35.282 --> 03:43:39.084]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[03:43:39.604 --> 03:43:43.526]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[03:43:43.886 --> 03:43:45.907]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[03:43:46.147 --> 03:43:47.628]  This country is in a war!
[03:43:48.468 --> 03:43:58.513]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[03:43:59.173 --> 03:44:02.755]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[03:44:07.469 --> 03:44:08.770]  Here's the thing, I'm not giving up.
[03:44:09.451 --> 03:44:14.116]  Because I know we've got truth and justice on our side, but it takes money to wage this war.
[03:44:14.496 --> 03:44:18.220]  You're spreading the word, you're praying for us, and you're financially supporting us.
[03:44:18.480 --> 03:44:21.584]  It's key, it's essential, it's absolute like oxygen.
[03:44:21.884 --> 03:44:24.747]  We have to have it, and we've got great products you already need.
[03:44:24.767 --> 03:44:26.809]  I mean, take fish oil, what it does for your heart.
[03:44:26.909 --> 03:44:28.070]  Your brain energy?
[03:44:28.090 --> 03:44:29.611]  I don't even usually take a nootropic.
[03:44:29.751 --> 03:44:32.292]  If I'm up at 10 o'clock at night and I gotta work till 3 a.m.
[03:44:32.372 --> 03:44:35.414]  on Coast to Coast AM or some show, I'll pop five fish oils.
[03:44:35.494 --> 03:44:37.175]  Nobody calls fish oil a nootropic.
[03:44:37.736 --> 03:44:39.036]  Your brain's electrochemical.
[03:44:39.056 --> 03:44:41.298]  It's basically made out of what fish oil is.
[03:44:41.498 --> 03:44:42.839]  Fish oil is what floats my boat.
[03:44:43.779 --> 03:44:45.080]  I mean, I take it every morning right now.
[03:44:45.280 --> 03:44:49.983]  First thing I get up at 6 a.m., with my coffee, I bang back three big ol' fat, juicy fish oils.
[03:44:50.303 --> 03:44:55.526]  And so, our Ultimate Krill Oil is even better than the fish oil, what it does for your brain, but there's no way to denature it.
[03:44:55.606 --> 03:44:58.948]  It gives you the burps, I'm not gonna lie to you, but if you can deal with it, it's it.
[03:44:58.988 --> 03:45:01.129]  The Ultimate Krill Oil is rocket fuel, baby.
[03:45:01.269 --> 03:45:02.470]  I mean, it's the next level.
[03:45:02.650 --> 03:45:05.372]  Ultimate Fish Oil, all crafted out of fjords, amazing.
[03:45:05.392 --> 03:45:07.753]  Doesn't give you the burpees, neither does Honor Roll.
[03:45:07.893 --> 03:45:10.615]  It's amazing for your kids, small caplets, but I tend to like Honor Roll.
[03:45:10.715 --> 03:45:11.015]  Okay, I'm
[03:45:11.015 --> 03:45:12.516]  I'm a fish oil addict, I'm not gonna lie.
[03:45:12.636 --> 03:45:13.476]  I gobble the stuff.
[03:45:13.716 --> 03:45:14.897]  Coffee's a thing of the past now.
[03:45:15.497 --> 03:45:16.738]  Brain force is a thing of the past.
[03:45:16.918 --> 03:45:18.518]  And for different people, different things.
[03:45:19.379 --> 03:45:22.460]  I'm just telling you, fish oil is numero uno.
[03:45:22.960 --> 03:45:27.903]  Infowarsstore.com, infowarslive.com, or triple A, two five three, three one three nine.
[03:45:33.407 --> 03:45:35.728]  It uses a medicinal herb of thousands of years.
[03:45:35.768 --> 03:45:38.390]  Turmeric is one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[03:45:38.770 --> 03:45:44.093]  It is there for the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support.
[03:45:44.333 --> 03:45:52.438]  And it's got the turmeric root extract, the Boswellia serrata extract, organic spearmint, sage, lemon balm, thyme leaves, and piperine from black pepper.
[03:45:52.798 --> 03:45:57.721]  It will help you take control of your body and feel the power of turmeric like never before.

[03:47:26.830 --> 03:47:33.415]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:33.895 --> 03:47:36.798]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:47:40.087 --> 03:47:42.969]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:43.749 --> 03:47:46.491]  You know, I agree with what Alex Jones just said.
[03:47:46.571 --> 03:47:50.033]  There's nothing really worse than a Southern white liberal.
[03:47:50.633 --> 03:47:53.495]  And what he described was infanticide.
[03:47:53.575 --> 03:47:54.095]  That's right.
[03:47:54.195 --> 03:47:56.737]  The murder of a born child.
[03:47:57.483 --> 03:48:13.124]  Donald Trump called him out last night, but contrast the situation with Governor Northam, who was found red-handed to have a yearbook photo of him either in blackface or in a Ku Klux Klan outfit.
[03:48:13.684 --> 03:48:15.845]  First, he said, well, he apologized.
[03:48:15.905 --> 03:48:16.626]  That was him.
[03:48:17.086 --> 03:48:19.007]  Then he said, well, maybe it wasn't him.
[03:48:19.528 --> 03:48:22.149]  But he admitted that he'd been in blackface previously.
[03:48:22.689 --> 03:48:27.472]  Now compare that to Florida Secretary of State Mike Urtel.
[03:48:28.073 --> 03:48:34.196]  Mike Urtel was appointed Secretary of State by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis.
[03:48:34.957 --> 03:48:41.160]  And when a photo of him surfaced in blackface, he resigned within 24 hours.
[03:48:42.836 --> 03:48:46.039]  You see, that's the difference between Republicans and Democrats.
[03:48:46.519 --> 03:48:51.323]  Both of them wrong, but in this case, Northam trying to hold on to power.
[03:48:51.984 --> 03:48:58.509]  You saw that group of women clad in white last night during the President's State of the Union address.
[03:48:59.050 --> 03:49:04.334]  I haven't seen that many Democrats wearing white since they formed the Ku Klux Klan.
[03:49:05.075 --> 03:49:11.140]  No, last night was a Reagan-esque tour de force for President Donald Trump.
[03:49:11.815 --> 03:49:19.822]  Now, I personally have attended six State of the Union addresses during the eight years of the Reagan presidency.
[03:49:20.242 --> 03:49:30.752]  But I must tell you, I never felt the kind of energy, the kind of dynamism that you could feel in the room last night when I was watching on TV.
[03:49:31.787 --> 03:49:39.691]  I thought Ronald Reagan was the father of our greatest economic comeback until Donald Trump became president.
[03:49:40.131 --> 03:49:47.614]  And now America is open for business and we finally have a president who puts America first.
[03:49:48.475 --> 03:49:55.338]  Contrast that with the disrespectful, even bizarre behavior of Nancy Pelosi.
[03:49:56.056 --> 03:50:05.323]  Shuffling through the papers while the president is speaking in an extraordinary display of disrespect and arrogance.
[03:50:05.864 --> 03:50:13.990]  In the meantime, I don't criticize her for not smiling because she has so much Botox, I don't think she can move her face.
[03:50:14.671 --> 03:50:22.237]  But the antics of the Democrats on the floor watching Octavia Cortez air
[03:50:23.166 --> 03:50:30.430]  Slapping no one, slapping five with the air, was nothing less than bizarre.
[03:50:31.091 --> 03:50:33.612]  The president, I think, hit all the right notes.
[03:50:33.712 --> 03:50:37.814]  First, he talked about the major comeback of America's economy.
[03:50:38.995 --> 03:50:42.577]  4.8 million new jobs.
[03:50:42.597 --> 03:50:44.698]  500,000 manufacturing jobs alone.
[03:50:45.199 --> 03:50:48.801]  Those are the jobs Barack Obama said were never coming back.
[03:50:49.682 --> 03:51:06.699]  300,000 new jobs in the last quarter, almost twice the estimate, wage growth at an all-time high, and African-American and Hispanic unemployment at the lowest point since they began keeping those statistics.
[03:51:07.299 --> 03:51:11.622]  Then, of course, the President called out Robert Mueller and the Deep State.
[03:51:12.083 --> 03:51:27.815]  Because after two years and $30 million of your tax money, we still have no evidence of Russian collusion or any other crime that involves Russia and connects the Trump campaign to the Russian state.
[03:51:28.335 --> 03:51:32.138]  Let's face it, this is a move to remove our President.
[03:51:32.788 --> 03:51:43.935]  The most troubling thing about yesterday was the stunning news that The War Room, which I co-host with my colleague Owen Schroyer, has been knocked off of Facebook.
[03:51:44.455 --> 03:51:53.421]  Folks, this is part of the same insidious, relentless campaign of censorship that is being wielded against InfoWars.
[03:51:53.441 --> 03:51:53.501]  Why?
[03:51:53.921 --> 03:51:56.283]  Because Alex Jones brings you the truth.
[03:51:56.663 --> 03:51:59.305]  Because Roger Stone brings you the truth.
[03:51:59.645 --> 03:52:11.096]  Because David Knight and Oren Schroyer and Millie Weaver and so many others on the Infowar team give it to you straight, unvarnished, unedited, the stone cold truth, if you will.
[03:52:11.517 --> 03:52:13.619]  And that's why they want to take us down.
[03:52:14.219 --> 03:52:15.180]  What's the answer?
[03:52:15.260 --> 03:52:18.984]  Well, we're prepared to fight, but not if you don't have our back.
[03:52:19.524 --> 03:52:23.725]  I've got to be honest with you, I'm going through some very difficult days, as people know.
[03:52:24.185 --> 03:52:33.867]  But there's a new product, and I think people know I use the M4 products, I swear by Brain Force Plus, but Turbo Force takes it to a whole new level.
[03:52:34.467 --> 03:52:41.328]  This product gives me the vitality and the energy that I need to fight 12 hours a day.
[03:52:41.788 --> 03:52:44.709]  It's round the clock for me these days, meeting with
[03:52:45.009 --> 03:52:45.289]  Yes.
[03:53:15.069 --> 03:53:17.310]  Your vitality, your intellect.
[03:53:17.651 --> 03:53:19.472]  It's more than just a physical lift.
[03:53:19.552 --> 03:53:21.733]  It's a mental lift at the same time.
[03:53:22.133 --> 03:53:27.716]  So please, recognize that we cannot continue to conduct the war against the deep state.
[03:53:28.157 --> 03:53:35.821]  We cannot continue to fight with George Soros and the insidious and corrupt intelligence agencies
[03:53:36.161 --> 03:53:42.644]  That are still sadly in the control of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama without your support.
[03:53:43.084 --> 03:53:49.988]  And the campaign of censorship that is being run against InfoWars is part of their master plan.
[03:53:50.588 --> 03:53:53.669]  It's not a secret to anybody that they want to take me down.
[03:53:53.749 --> 03:53:56.671]  They want to send me to prison for the rest of my life.
[03:53:57.071 --> 03:54:05.135]  And I want people to understand that the platform of InfoWars is vitally important in terms of my strategy for survival.
[03:54:05.715 --> 03:54:24.817]  If I don't have the ability to come to InfoWars and tell you exactly what's going on, tell you why an Obama-appointed judge is now considering slapping a gag on me, and why I believe that gag will be challenged in court and could be overturned, because I can't come to InfoWars and tell you the story.
[03:54:25.357 --> 03:54:31.379]  No, when I go on any of these other channels, they give me little time and they try to edit what I say.
[03:54:31.779 --> 03:54:41.742]  Now, I'm not going to tell you a chapter and verse about the charges against me, other than to say that a vital part of my strategy
[03:54:42.182 --> 03:54:42.743]  We're good to go.
[03:55:00.206 --> 03:55:05.775]  About what we say and report here at Infowars and send it to your email list.
[03:55:06.076 --> 03:55:11.745]  Put it up on your Facebook page, your Twitter page, your Instagram page.
[03:55:12.085 --> 03:55:13.768]  You've got to spread the word.
[03:55:14.747 --> 03:55:19.148]  You see, Alex Jones is like the Paul Revere of this revolution.
[03:55:19.608 --> 03:55:22.809]  He's the early warning system that tells you what's coming.
[03:55:23.209 --> 03:55:25.950]  And that's why they are so desperate to silence him.
[03:55:26.390 --> 03:55:29.171]  So please go to the mforce.com store now.
[03:55:29.631 --> 03:55:30.571]  There's a lot of choices.
[03:55:31.011 --> 03:55:36.173]  You can buy one of our great nutraceutical products like TurboForce or BrainForce Plus.
[03:55:36.733 --> 03:55:46.055]  Or one my sister really likes, the turmeric formula, is I find really good for people who are on their feet long hours.
[03:55:46.575 --> 03:55:49.316]  She's a waitress, she swears by it.
[03:55:49.816 --> 03:55:54.137]  Or you can buy one of our books, or t-shirts, or you can just send a contribution.
[03:55:54.157 --> 03:55:54.137]  $25, $50, $100, $500.
[03:55:54.617 --> 03:55:56.378]  Yes, some InfoWarriors, they've even sent $1,000.
[03:55:56.438 --> 03:55:58.318]  But whether it is any of our nutraceuticals,
[03:56:05.980 --> 03:56:12.748]  Any of our books, any of our t-shirts, you can rest assured that you're helping fund the fight for freedom.
[03:56:13.149 --> 03:56:16.152]  You're helping fund the fight for the First Amendment.
[03:56:16.533 --> 03:56:19.837]  You are helping fund the fight to preserve the U.S.
[03:56:19.917 --> 03:56:20.738]  Constitution.
[03:56:21.358 --> 03:56:39.531]  As someone who's targeted for extinction, I want to thank the many in the InfoWars community who have helped me, who have prayed for me, who have contributed to my legal defense fund, and who fight every day to make sure the platform of InfoWars is there so you can hear the truth.
[03:56:39.911 --> 03:56:42.413]  You don't have to depend on CNN.
[03:56:42.713 --> 03:56:47.297]  I don't get my news from CNN for the same reason I don't eat out of the toilet.
[03:56:47.937 --> 03:56:57.505]  I don't watch Fox half the time unless Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity or even Judge Andrew Napolitano, all good friends of mine, are on.
[03:56:58.006 --> 03:56:59.487]  I've tuned out Fox.
[03:56:59.867 --> 03:57:10.617]  But if you want to know the truth, if you want to get the full story, the unvarnished story, the stone-cold truth, as it were, there's only one place.
[03:57:11.017 --> 03:57:12.158]  That's InfoWars.
[03:57:12.598 --> 03:57:14.800]  Alex Jones needs you to have his back.
[03:57:15.140 --> 03:57:18.483]  We all here at InfoWars need you to have our back.
[03:57:18.803 --> 03:57:22.887]  Go to the InfoWars.com store now and be generous.
[03:57:23.427 --> 03:57:26.630]  This is a fight for the future of Western civilization.
[03:57:27.070 --> 03:57:31.514]  This is a fight for our heritage and our culture and our freedom.
[03:57:32.094 --> 03:57:33.535]  We will never falter.
[03:57:33.555 --> 03:57:34.876]  We will never fold.
[03:57:34.996 --> 03:57:36.717]  We will never cut and run.
[03:57:37.158 --> 03:57:39.099]  We will never head to the high grass.
[03:57:39.399 --> 03:57:41.541]  But we need you to have our back.
[03:57:42.001 --> 03:57:46.024]  Thank you and God bless you for joining me here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:56.457 --> 03:57:58.618]  Andy, want to talk about being involved in the fight for the 2nd A?
[03:57:59.158 --> 03:57:59.998]  Yeah, that's the big one.
[03:58:00.719 --> 03:58:01.659]  They're coming at it with guns.
[03:58:01.699 --> 03:58:04.300]  The Democrats say they have the votes in the House to ban semi-autos.
[03:58:04.780 --> 03:58:05.981]  They're going to try to pass it.
[03:58:06.001 --> 03:58:08.802]  Notice they've gone from denying they want to ban the 2nd Amendment to admitting it.
[03:58:09.562 --> 03:58:09.802]  Andy?
[03:58:10.022 --> 03:58:11.083]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[03:58:11.143 --> 03:58:12.863]  I've got to say, Alex, I'm a big fan of the show.
[03:58:12.903 --> 03:58:14.044]  I'm a big fan of both of my daughters.
[03:58:14.404 --> 03:58:20.747]  I need to take some of that because I'm a little bit run down with allergies today and I'm always like, wait, my own products are great.
[03:58:20.767 --> 03:58:22.968]  I think I should take some Brain Force Pluses or something.
[03:58:34.753 --> 03:58:35.854]  Secret 12, you're absolutely right.
[03:58:35.874 --> 03:58:36.374]  There you go.
[03:58:36.454 --> 03:58:43.039]  Well, hey, in my home state of Connecticut here, we're facing some very tough economic times, which is causing taxes to go up.
[03:58:43.079 --> 03:58:45.400]  There's businesses and people leaving the state in droves.
[03:58:45.620 --> 03:58:52.885]  One of the taxes they're introducing, or want to, hopefully this won't pass, is they want a 50% tax on your ammunition, no matter what it is.
[03:58:52.965 --> 03:58:55.287]  They also force, I mean, they force Remington out of business.
[03:58:55.307 --> 03:58:58.449]  The same law firm suing me sued Remington out of business.
[03:58:58.469 --> 03:58:59.770]  Yeah, another law they're trying to pass.
