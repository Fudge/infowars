[00:00:04.175 --> 00:00:12.787]  Joel Pollack of Breitbart News confronted Joe Biden at the Iowa State Fair on the lie the Democrat Party won't let die.
[00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.752]  Mr. Vice President, are you aware that you're misquoting Donald Trump in Charlottesville?
[00:00:16.772 --> 00:00:18.714]  He never called neo-Nazis very fine people.
[00:00:19.355 --> 00:00:22.817]  He called all those folks that walked out of that, they were neo-Nazis.
[00:00:22.977 --> 00:00:23.817]  Shouting hate.
[00:00:24.277 --> 00:00:25.198]  Their veins bulging.
[00:00:25.238 --> 00:00:27.259]  But he said specifically that he was condemning them.
[00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.219]  No, he did not.
[00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.380]  He said he walked out and he said, let's get this straight.
[00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.182]  He said there were very fine people in both groups.
[00:00:34.462 --> 00:00:37.603]  They're chanting anti-Semitic slogans, carrying flags.
[00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:42.745]  Pollock was referencing this claim Biden made yet again in a recent speech.
[00:00:43.286 --> 00:00:45.827]  When he said, after Charlottesville,
[00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:51.895]  There were, and I quote, very fine people on both sides.
[00:00:53.456 --> 00:01:01.678]  I said then, it gave license and safe harbor to white supremacists and neo-Nazis and to the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.860]  These wars not only stunned America, but they stunned the world.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.822]  And in doing so, he assigned a moral equivalence, a moral equivalence between those spewing hate
[00:01:15.885 --> 00:01:17.686]  And those are the courage to stand against it.
[00:01:18.387 --> 00:01:24.091]  The nefarious go-to slanderous claim of fine people on both sides is a Democratic hoax.
[00:01:24.512 --> 00:01:25.612]  It's simply not true.
[00:01:25.873 --> 00:01:35.280]  Here again, for all to see, is what President Trump said regarding the protesting citizens in Charlottesville, Virginia, who he had actually been referring to.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:51.487]  And the white nationalists who he condemned totally on that August 15, 2017 day at Trump Towers while dealing with a rabid propagandized media swarm just three days after the incident at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.
[00:01:58.277 --> 00:02:00.178]  Very fine people on both sides.
[00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:05.542]  You had people in that group, excuse me, excuse me, I saw the same pictures as you did.
[00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:17.050]  You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.
[00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:32.537]  You're changing history, you're changing culture, and you had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally, but you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay?
[00:02:33.017 --> 00:02:34.318]  And the press has treated them
[00:02:34.998 --> 00:02:36.439]  Absolutely unfairly.
[00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:49.743]  Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people, but you also had troublemakers, and you see them come with the black outfits, and with the helmets, and with the baseball bats.
[00:02:49.763 --> 00:02:52.384]  You had a lot of bad people in the other group.
[00:02:52.444 --> 00:02:59.707]  Meanwhile, Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden is the one actually dangerously spreading hate-filled false vitriol.
[00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:02.268]  When Trump announced he was running for president,
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.021]  He called Mexicans rapists.
[00:03:06.342 --> 00:03:17.868]  Days before the midterm, he fomented fears of a caravan heading to the United States, creating hysteria when he said, look, look what's marching up.
[00:03:17.908 --> 00:03:20.469]  This is an invasion, an invasion.
[00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.333]  He asserted that immigrants would, quote, carve you up with a knife.
[00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:39.590]  More recently, he called a major American center, city, a disgusting, rat-infected, rodent mess.
[00:03:40.851 --> 00:03:50.455]  No human being, he said, would choose to live as though the vibrant, diverse community around Baltimore somehow was less than human.
[00:03:51.836 --> 00:03:52.937]  At a rally in Florida,
[00:03:53.868 --> 00:03:57.130]  When he asked the crowd, how do we stop these people?
[00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.610]  Meaning immigrants.
[00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:01.372]  Someone yelled back, shoot them.
[00:04:02.272 --> 00:04:03.112]  And he smiled.
[00:04:03.933 --> 00:04:08.195]  But lately, creepy Joe Biden has devolved into a gaffe machine.
[00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:10.436]  We choose unity over division.
[00:04:10.736 --> 00:04:12.477]  We choose science over fiction.
[00:04:12.817 --> 00:04:14.938]  We choose truth over facts.
[00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.621]  Who's your favorite historical figure, and who's not a president, and why?
[00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:26.096]  And I have to start off, and you said not a president, I have to start off with Jefferson, even though he didn't live up to it.
[00:04:26.376 --> 00:04:29.161]  He's the guy that wrote that incredible document.
[00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:32.446]  Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.
[00:04:33.553 --> 00:04:40.196]  There is a huge difference between calling things out for what they are, as Donald Trump has done, to the Washington, D.C.
[00:04:40.256 --> 00:04:46.899]  establishment's ire, and blatantly attempting to pull the wool over the voters' eyes, as D.C.
[00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.760]  insider lackey Joe Biden has done.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.441]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:05:04.023 --> 00:05:05.464]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[00:05:05.744 --> 00:05:07.504]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer.
[00:05:07.845 --> 00:05:09.205]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[00:05:09.605 --> 00:05:10.505]  But I'll be honest with you.
[00:05:11.346 --> 00:05:15.767]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[00:05:16.688 --> 00:05:18.348]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[00:05:18.548 --> 00:05:19.168]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:20.589]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:22.862]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[00:05:23.082 --> 00:05:25.524]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:26.544]  I don't want them to win.
[00:05:26.945 --> 00:05:28.966]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[00:05:29.866 --> 00:05:32.628]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[00:05:32.968 --> 00:05:35.730]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:39.873]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[00:05:39.933 --> 00:05:41.134]  These will change your life.
[00:05:41.494 --> 00:05:42.875]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[00:05:42.895 --> 00:05:44.596]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[00:05:44.896 --> 00:05:45.556]  Check it all out.
[00:05:45.576 --> 00:05:47.197]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[00:05:47.537 --> 00:05:49.138]  Be part of the Second American Revolution.
[00:05:49.338 --> 00:05:50.518]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[00:05:50.678 --> 00:05:51.959]  You'll get great products at the same time.
[00:05:52.299 --> 00:05:54.440]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.701]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[00:05:56.942 --> 00:06:00.023]  Take action now and fund the Infowar for your own future.
[00:06:09.192 --> 00:06:10.553]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:10.713 --> 00:06:16.476]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:16.916 --> 00:06:21.178]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:34.685]  It is Monday, August 12th, 2019.
[00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:42.072]  And yes, the Alex Jones Show is still on air.
[00:06:42.952 --> 00:06:51.358]  Despite all the attempts to murder it in jail like they did to Jeffrey Epstein, here we are, all of us together.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.684]  And on this extremely important Alex Jones Show today, what an honor it is to be filling in for Alex.
[00:06:58.704 --> 00:06:59.824]  He'll be joining us shortly.
[00:06:59.844 --> 00:07:05.989]  We're also going to be joined by Robert Barnes, Patrick Howley, and Paul Joseph Watson before Gerald Cilenti takes over the fourth hour.
[00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:07.630]  And actually, I'm going to talk to Gerald
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.601]  I've got a couple questions for him.
[00:07:12.482 --> 00:07:29.272]  My stacks of news include some international news, I have a whole stack of Epstein news that's just going to blow your mind, and then I've got some domestic American news that's just kind of out there, some frills on the whole surface, but important nonetheless.
[00:07:31.193 --> 00:07:36.176]  But I'm sitting thinking to myself, how do you begin
[00:07:37.608 --> 00:07:42.911]  Today's Alex Jones Show with this Epstein murder hanging over our heads.
[00:07:42.971 --> 00:07:47.994]  Because, I mean, you want to talk about the biggest cover-ups of all time.
[00:07:49.615 --> 00:07:51.816]  The JFK assassination, September 11, 2001.
[00:07:51.936 --> 00:07:57.820]  I mean, those are probably at the top of my list, but the Epstein murder might be the biggest one ever.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:06.665]  Not because of its importance as far as Epstein as an individual is concerned and how that influences or impacts the average American's life.
[00:08:07.845 --> 00:08:11.887]  As September 11th would have, or the JFK assassination even.
[00:08:12.908 --> 00:08:17.951]  But because... I always have the word, they.
[00:08:18.251 --> 00:08:19.032]  Who is they?
[00:08:20.092 --> 00:08:24.395]  Well, they got away with murdering Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:08:26.236 --> 00:08:30.218]  And they did it right in front of all of our faces.
[00:08:33.117 --> 00:08:36.261]  And so I'm sitting here today thinking, what do you do?
[00:08:36.401 --> 00:08:39.404]  How do you cover the biggest cover-up of all time?
[00:08:40.566 --> 00:08:52.560]  And in the past, InfoWars' role is to defy the mainstream narrative, push the boundaries, say what people are thinking, because no one else will do it.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.161]  But now...
[00:08:55.572 --> 00:09:00.997]  Any logical person realizes that Jeffrey Epstein was offed in prison and that it's being covered up.
[00:09:01.297 --> 00:09:02.518]  It's really not that hard.
[00:09:02.638 --> 00:09:04.040]  It's basic math.
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:11.767]  If 1 plus 1 equals 3, hmm, even the kindergartner says, no, it doesn't.
[00:09:11.907 --> 00:09:12.247]  It equals 2.
[00:09:12.467 --> 00:09:13.588]  Oh, okay then.
[00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:18.753]  So they're saying Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide in jail.
[00:09:18.773 --> 00:09:19.614]  1 plus 1 equals 3.
[00:09:23.388 --> 00:09:25.928]  So, I just want to say this before I get into all the headlines.
[00:09:26.048 --> 00:09:43.932]  I thought to myself, you know, if I was in a time capsule, which you're always in time capsules of life, every experience, everything that you've done is a capsule of your larger life.
[00:09:45.072 --> 00:09:51.873]  So what if I was just in a capsule for five years, and I came up to the surface today,
[00:09:53.806 --> 00:09:54.606]  What would I think?
[00:09:54.726 --> 00:09:55.707]  What would I be feeling?
[00:09:56.747 --> 00:09:57.947]  What would I think of the world?
[00:09:58.007 --> 00:09:58.887]  How has it changed?
[00:09:59.247 --> 00:10:01.368]  And there is one thing that you cannot deny.
[00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:05.929]  The world has changed significantly.
[00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:16.432]  And I think the response to the Jeffrey Epstein murder encapsulates that change.
[00:10:18.372 --> 00:10:20.293]  So I had the crew go back and just print
[00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:23.189]  Five years ago's headlines on Drudge Report.
[00:10:23.369 --> 00:10:25.670]  And it's got some normal stuff, nothing too big.
[00:10:26.871 --> 00:10:31.214]  But you had Obama releasing illegal, criminal, illegal immigrants into the population.
[00:10:31.334 --> 00:10:32.155]  That's still going on.
[00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:44.484]  And you had the Mike Brown protests going on, where, ironically enough, the same guy that did the autopsy on Mike Brown is going to be doing another autopsy on Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:10:44.504 --> 00:10:47.186]  Now, we'll get into that and some conspiracy theories around that, too.
[00:10:49.067 --> 00:10:49.988]  But just think about it.
[00:10:53.018 --> 00:10:56.781]  Think about all the false narratives the media has been able to get away with.
[00:10:58.802 --> 00:11:02.405]  Think about all the lies and all the cover-ups that they've been involved in.
[00:11:02.425 --> 00:11:07.989]  And now here we are today, and isn't it perfect?
[00:11:08.109 --> 00:11:09.350]  It's almost the Trump Test 2.0.
[00:11:10.511 --> 00:11:14.174]  See, the Trump Test began in about 2015.
[00:11:18.317 --> 00:11:23.539]  And I'm not sure when you want to say it ended, because a lot of people got off the Trump train because he's not a purist, and some other reasons.
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:30.943]  But let's just say the Trump test started in 2015 and ended on election night.
[00:11:31.463 --> 00:11:34.645]  The Trump test was basically, look, you've got two options.
[00:11:35.505 --> 00:11:46.330]  Hillary Clinton, a known criminal, laughs about starting wars, laughs about killing sovereign leaders, is involved in so much crime, her husband the same deal, running off on Pedophile Island,
[00:11:47.628 --> 00:11:49.650]  Everybody knows about the Clinton body count.
[00:11:49.810 --> 00:12:00.941]  So a total rat infested, covered in feces, rodent, vermin Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump who's kind of an unknown, kind of walks into it like a lion.
[00:12:01.181 --> 00:12:02.242]  He's got some blood on him.
[00:12:02.262 --> 00:12:06.967]  You're not sure if that's because he was savaging someone or if he was just involved in protecting himself, but okay, you know.
[00:12:09.537 --> 00:12:10.518]  That was basically your option.
[00:12:10.638 --> 00:12:15.980]  A feces-covered rat, Hillary Clinton, just gnawing and heathing.
[00:12:16.801 --> 00:12:22.024]  Or Donald Trump, a lion, coming in roaring, and you're like, okay, is this guy going to eat me or is he going to defend me?
[00:12:23.024 --> 00:12:23.845]  But it's an unknown.
[00:12:25.485 --> 00:12:27.406]  That rat's going to give you rabies and kill you.
[00:12:29.688 --> 00:12:30.828]  So, but that was the Trump test.
[00:12:31.349 --> 00:12:32.509]  Now it's the Epstein test.
[00:12:32.529 --> 00:12:33.730]  Now you notice America
[00:12:35.723 --> 00:12:36.944]  I mean, literally, thank God.
[00:12:37.504 --> 00:12:38.305]  Thank this audience.
[00:12:38.545 --> 00:12:40.586]  Thank a few other audiences out there.
[00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:41.867]  And Donald Trump.
[00:12:44.649 --> 00:12:46.050]  We were able to pass the Trump Test.
[00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:47.151]  And it's beyond Trump.
[00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:48.211]  It's just common sense.
[00:12:48.432 --> 00:12:51.634]  Is there enough common sense left for us to save America?
[00:12:51.754 --> 00:12:55.556]  Is there enough common sense left for us to actually do something right as a nation?
[00:12:56.917 --> 00:12:57.958]  So, that was the Trump Test.
[00:12:57.978 --> 00:12:58.458]  We passed it.
[00:12:58.498 --> 00:12:58.899]  Thank God.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.442]  Now, the Epstein Test is here.
[00:13:03.582 --> 00:13:05.343]  And the Epstein Test is next level.
[00:13:07.148 --> 00:13:21.119]  When you see media publications telling you you're a conspiracy theorist if you don't believe the official narrative that Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide, you know they are not your friend.
[00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:28.425]  How can any person in the media, this was, and again, this is where the Epstein test starts now.
[00:13:30.426 --> 00:13:35.010]  Any person in the media with any integrity, any self-respect, any conscience
[00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:41.893]  Any gut, any instincts, not totally sold out, is questioning the Jeffrey Epstein death.
[00:13:42.894 --> 00:13:43.754]  At the very least.
[00:13:44.375 --> 00:13:53.882]  Anybody telling you, shut up, believe the mainstream narrative, is probably, honestly, I hate to say this, because, I'm sure it's not true, but, are they in on it?
[00:13:56.284 --> 00:14:00.567]  You're gonna tell me, oh yeah, Jeffrey Epstein just committed suicide in jail, nothing to see here.
[00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:01.328]  Really?
[00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:04.761]  But they are!
[00:14:05.402 --> 00:14:09.964]  New York Times, Washington Post, it's all over TV, MSNBC over the weekend.
[00:14:11.105 --> 00:14:11.665]  CNN?
[00:14:12.566 --> 00:14:15.747]  Conspiracy theories say Epstein must have been murdered.
[00:14:16.968 --> 00:14:17.368]  Really?
[00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.590]  Conspiracy theories.
[00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:27.754]  You mean the same conspiracy theories that said JFK was assassinated and there was more than one shooter?
[00:14:28.655 --> 00:14:32.517]  And then it came out when Donald J. Trump released the classified JFK files?
[00:14:35.691 --> 00:14:38.974]  You mean the conspiracy theorists that said there was something else going on with September 11th?
[00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:41.776]  And the questions still remain today?
[00:14:45.339 --> 00:14:49.002]  And then we launched these trillion-dollar wars in the Middle East that nobody won?
[00:14:49.342 --> 00:14:49.522]  Ever?
[00:14:49.682 --> 00:14:50.323]  Nobody could win?
[00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:55.207]  So when we come back, Alex Jones is going to break it all down.
[00:14:57.228 --> 00:14:58.109]  But it's a new world now.
[00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.391]  It's a new world than it was five years ago.
[00:15:01.547 --> 00:15:13.121]  Because I don't have to come on air and tell you here, hosting the Alex Jones Show at Infowars.com, slash show, that Jeffrey Epstein was murdered, or that he didn't commit suicide.
[00:15:13.241 --> 00:15:15.724]  I don't know what happened, but he didn't commit suicide.
[00:15:18.729 --> 00:15:20.309]  But I don't have to be the one to tell you that today.
[00:15:20.989 --> 00:15:22.830]  And I don't look so crazy telling you that today.
[00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.730]  Because anybody with a brain sees that.
[00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.231]  So this is the Trump test we passed.
[00:15:28.291 --> 00:15:29.011]  We got Trump in.
[00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:29.951]  Doesn't mean he's perfect.
[00:15:30.091 --> 00:15:31.011]  Doesn't mean we're perfect.
[00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:31.831]  But we changed the world.
[00:15:31.871 --> 00:15:32.771]  We moved in the right direction.
[00:15:33.231 --> 00:15:35.492]  Now this Epstein case is the next test.
[00:15:36.092 --> 00:15:39.893]  And quite frankly, millions of Americans probably should have been outside that prison demanding answers.
[00:15:39.933 --> 00:15:41.053]  But we're all asleep.
[00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:41.973]  We're all on our cell phones.
[00:15:41.993 --> 00:15:44.073]  I think Kim Kardashian, you know, dropped a new clothing line.
[00:15:44.093 --> 00:15:44.273]  So.
[00:15:45.334 --> 00:15:46.634]  But this is the Epstein test.
[00:15:47.314 --> 00:15:47.954]  Now you watch.
[00:15:49.195 --> 00:15:50.536]  What is media going to say about this?
[00:15:50.576 --> 00:15:52.937]  Are they going to tell you to sit down, shut up and close your eyes?
[00:15:52.957 --> 00:15:58.239]  Or are they going to say this is a massive nuclear fire that they just tried to cover up?
[00:15:58.299 --> 00:15:59.140]  What the hell is going on?
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.740]  Alex Jones explains it on the other side.
[00:16:02.601 --> 00:16:04.802]  There's a war on our children.
[00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:09.484]  Because predators know that a child is defenseless.
[00:16:10.185 --> 00:16:16.668]  That a child will be embarrassed when they get abused or hurt and a lot of times won't report it.
[00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:35.827]  I remember three years ago when the Boy Scouts of America that I was part of, since I was a Cub Scout, Good Wholesome Americana Institution, was handing out condoms at their World Jamboree and encouraging promiscuous sex, whether it was heterosexual or homosexual.
[00:16:35.887 --> 00:16:36.728]  That's pedophilia.
[00:16:36.748 --> 00:16:37.268]  That's criminal.
[00:16:37.928 --> 00:16:39.890]  Well, now it's come out in big press conferences.
[00:16:40.911 --> 00:16:52.738]  That there are thousands of protected pedophiles in the Boy Scouts of America who came there to use that great institution as a place to target our children, like shooting fish in a barrel.
[00:16:54.098 --> 00:17:03.904]  And we've seen the National Library Association say they are now places for drag queen story time, where men dress as clowns, many of them sexual offenders, rapists.
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:17.069]  Disguised themselves as It the Clown and come and mothers as a sacrament to evil bring their little babies and sit them on their lap and simulate, well you know what?
[00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:19.751]  Even here in Austin, Texas.
[00:17:21.352 --> 00:17:26.336]  Recently they're having city council meetings about this and these groups are going and targeting children.
[00:17:26.616 --> 00:17:26.997]  Sometimes
[00:17:28.283 --> 00:17:36.209]  Unannounced at public schools, on career day, men disguised as women come and tell the children you could be a topless dancer at a gay bar.
[00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:38.091]  And now new articles.
[00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:41.613]  Drag Queen shows children how to twerk during story hour.
[00:17:41.913 --> 00:17:44.095]  Just move your bum up and down.
[00:17:45.496 --> 00:17:46.177]  Shake your booty.
[00:17:47.057 --> 00:17:49.880]  If a man did this to your child at a park, you'd say, get the hell away.
[00:17:50.802 --> 00:17:55.165]  If a man talked about your son or daughter's booty and told them they were another sex, they'd get arrested.
[00:17:55.666 --> 00:18:04.332]  But because it's done sanctioned by the state and sanctioned by these institutions, oh well it's okay because no one wants to call it out for what it is.
[00:18:05.073 --> 00:18:07.375]  But here at InfoWars, we are calling it out for what it is.
[00:18:08.255 --> 00:18:11.538]  And you know who the enemy is by who you can't speak about.
[00:18:14.212 --> 00:18:16.574]  We had Facebook and Twitter before we got banned over a year ago.
[00:18:16.694 --> 00:18:18.036]  We even recorded these conversations.
[00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:19.617]  We're going to do a report on them soon.
[00:18:19.657 --> 00:18:25.002]  Saying, look, do whatever you want, just don't talk about Islam and don't talk about the trans movement.
[00:18:25.542 --> 00:18:29.766]  We said, well, we're not against people if a man wants to try to be a woman or vice versa, but leave kids alone.
[00:18:30.827 --> 00:18:32.229]  Well, that's what we get banned for.
[00:18:32.249 --> 00:18:34.531]  So I'm proud that I stand up against predators.
[00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:39.936]  I'm proud that InfoWars stands up against these people that are there, whether they know it or not.
[00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:46.231]  We're grooming and recruiting and preparing children to be abused.
[00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:49.192]  And a lot of them get up and say, oh, we're here to groom your children.
[00:18:49.572 --> 00:18:51.113]  We're here to prepare them for their new life.
[00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:52.533]  And we're going to do it.
[00:18:53.734 --> 00:18:58.515]  My God, ladies and gentlemen, you wouldn't let the Army try to recruit your five-year-old, even though the Army's good overall.
[00:18:58.815 --> 00:19:00.216]  Still, that's, they're five.
[00:19:00.316 --> 00:19:01.836]  They need to make that decision when they're 18.
[00:19:02.817 --> 00:19:06.178]  This is about what sex they want to be, or to be chemically castrated.
[00:19:06.538 --> 00:19:10.399]  This is the most hardcore child abuse the world could ever imagine.
[00:19:11.533 --> 00:19:13.814]  So we've made a bold stand, and we're reaching a lot of people.
[00:19:15.035 --> 00:19:17.656]  But without you supporting us, we won't reach new people.
[00:19:18.336 --> 00:19:20.617]  It's only through word of mouth now that we're able to get out.
[00:19:20.897 --> 00:19:26.060]  Via email, via text message, via person-to-person, for people to learn about InfoWars.com forward slash show.

[00:19:34.129 --> 00:19:34.889]  Double Patriot points.

[00:19:40.773 --> 00:19:43.295]  But without your support, the enemy's going to win.

[00:19:54.563 --> 00:19:56.484]  Thank you for holding M4Wars in your hand.
[00:20:05.962 --> 00:20:18.129]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.752]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:31.677]  The progenitor of all the changes in the world that we have seen to get us to this point started at Infowars.com with this audience and Alex Jones.
[00:20:32.118 --> 00:20:35.941]  That's why we're the most censored name in news and Alex Jones is totally banned from the internet.
[00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:43.227]  Alex Jones joins us now to cover the crazy news surrounding Epstein and everything that's going on in the White House.
[00:20:43.407 --> 00:20:44.428]  Alex Jones, take it away.
[00:20:45.849 --> 00:20:47.170]  Well, that's right, Owen.
[00:20:47.311 --> 00:20:49.973]  I did bring equipment so I could broadcast from the road.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:59.503]  Because every time I try to take even a four or five day vacation with my children, I'm unable to do it because giant events take place.
[00:21:00.784 --> 00:21:03.805]  And sure enough, this Epstein situation took place.
[00:21:03.865 --> 00:21:11.027]  And then the cover-ups and the changing stories and the incredible obviousness of all of this has completely blown me away.
[00:21:11.047 --> 00:21:18.330]  And we're going to get to all of that coming up in the next segment and the wheels coming off the Democrats as well.
[00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:19.450]  But the first big thing
[00:21:20.931 --> 00:21:24.992]  And the reason I'm actually live with you today is I know you guys can handle all the Epstein stuff.
[00:21:25.032 --> 00:21:27.032]  You've got Paul Joseph Watson coming up.
[00:21:27.712 --> 00:21:32.133]  You've got an amazing Breitbart reporter coming up, who's a real expert on all this.
[00:21:32.413 --> 00:21:36.734]  You've also got Robert Barnes, who has been all over the Epstein situation.
[00:21:37.034 --> 00:21:39.034]  Knows a lot of the inside baseball from D.C.
[00:21:39.474 --> 00:21:43.015]  He's going to be on to a jam-packed show here today with Owen Troyer.
[00:21:43.795 --> 00:21:48.156]  But the real reason I'm on this morning, because my wife yesterday was like, OK, you want to head to the Sunday show.
[00:21:48.749 --> 00:21:50.370]  She's like, let me guess, you're gonna do tomorrow's show.
[00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:51.110]  And I said, no.
[00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.311]  I said, Owen and the crew have got a big line of guests.
[00:21:54.331 --> 00:21:55.252]  They're gonna do a great job.
[00:21:55.592 --> 00:21:57.633]  The listeners will understand why I'm not gonna be there.
[00:21:58.753 --> 00:22:08.898]  But then this morning I got up and I was looking at the news and there it was, just a little footnote on Infowars.com, Chinese troops enter Hong Kong.
[00:22:09.918 --> 00:22:15.761]  And then I went online and saw the videos of people having their heads beat in and blood everywhere and just how huge
[00:22:16.707 --> 00:22:26.931]  Geopolitically, this is now it signals that the world is going into a hot war, just like we saw India invade the disputed region of Kashmir last week.
[00:22:27.391 --> 00:22:35.814]  This is all serious tit for tat stuff and shows that the whole existing world order is crumbling down around itself.
[00:22:36.615 --> 00:22:38.475]  And so these big developments are just amazing.
[00:22:38.515 --> 00:22:42.357]  But because there's no urgency this morning at 7 a.m., I'm reading that.
[00:22:43.214 --> 00:22:45.336]  I decided to do the show because of it.
[00:22:45.956 --> 00:22:47.557]  I just could not not cover that.
[00:22:48.218 --> 00:22:49.579]  And then I forget about it.
[00:22:50.539 --> 00:22:53.882]  And I'm sitting here looking at the video list that the crew sent me.
[00:22:54.642 --> 00:22:57.084]  I'm in San Diego visiting my wife's family with my children.
[00:22:57.885 --> 00:23:00.466]  And the crew sends me the clips about what's happening in Hong Kong.
[00:23:00.647 --> 00:23:06.591]  And it's like a punch in the stomach that I forgot that as well because it's not in the consciousness.
[00:23:07.652 --> 00:23:08.712]  20 people get shot to death.
[00:23:08.752 --> 00:23:09.273]  It's terrible.
[00:23:09.493 --> 00:23:09.993]  It's horrible.
[00:23:10.193 --> 00:23:12.195]  In El Paso, the media
[00:23:13.107 --> 00:23:17.168]  Acts like it is the end of the world and all of us are to blame.
[00:23:17.488 --> 00:23:19.249]  We've got to overturn the Second Amendment.
[00:23:19.349 --> 00:23:20.609]  All white people are evil.
[00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:24.891]  Even though this guy was clearly a leftist antifa, so was the other guy in Ohio.
[00:23:25.611 --> 00:23:37.315]  But then, when you've got the Chi-Coms killing 115 million of their own people, when you've got them putting millions a year in forced labor camps, killing hundreds of thousands, selling their organs, it's like, oh, big deal.
[00:23:37.735 --> 00:23:38.415]  That's no big deal.
[00:23:38.675 --> 00:23:40.716]  Or when you have hundreds of people killed,
[00:23:41.522 --> 00:23:43.303]  Very mysteriously in and around the Clintons.
[00:23:43.943 --> 00:23:50.945]  And medical examiners like Fannie Malick, famously, who was the local medical examiner in Mena, Arkansas.
[00:23:50.985 --> 00:23:58.968]  Well, after kids got run over on the tracks and bullet wounds in their heads, and after he ruled that suicide, they made him the state medical examiner.
[00:23:58.988 --> 00:24:06.830]  And there would be people machine gunned off roads, their arms and legs cut off, burned inside plastic bags.
[00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.031]  And Fannie Malick would rule that a suicide.
[00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:14.432]  Obviously, you can't cut your arms and legs and head off and put yourself in a bag.
[00:24:14.452 --> 00:24:18.535]  Houdini, with godlike powers, couldn't do that.
[00:24:19.175 --> 00:24:20.656]  So this is the type of craziness.
[00:24:20.676 --> 00:24:24.399]  The Clinton death count is in the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[00:24:24.439 --> 00:24:25.039]  It's well over 300.
[00:24:25.079 --> 00:24:28.021]  There's some smaller lists that are like 100 out there.
[00:24:28.562 --> 00:24:35.767]  No, ladies and gentlemen, Treasury Secretary, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, he famously was
[00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:37.791]  Yeah, in trouble with the Clintons.
[00:24:37.811 --> 00:24:39.772]  And he said, if I go down, the Clintons go down.
[00:24:40.173 --> 00:24:42.354]  Well, he was found dead with a bullet hole in his head.
[00:24:42.374 --> 00:24:44.516]  They even crashed the airplane he was in.
[00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:52.982]  But even the Air Force medical examiner said no, he was shot in the head by a 45 caliber bullet.
[00:24:53.923 --> 00:24:56.305]  And so that segues us into the next segment.
[00:24:56.925 --> 00:24:59.948]  Some of what we're going to be covering the new Epstein developments.
[00:25:00.028 --> 00:25:01.249]  I called Paul Watson this morning.
[00:25:01.289 --> 00:25:01.849]  He's on later.
[00:25:01.869 --> 00:25:04.231]  I said, why do you think this is so obvious?
[00:25:05.017 --> 00:25:12.063]  And he said, I think it's because they want to make us totally lose confidence in the system and have a revolution.
[00:25:12.123 --> 00:25:16.686]  I said, well, we know they want to have a racial and cultural revolution that the left and others are funding.
[00:25:16.747 --> 00:25:18.708]  But I said, Paul, I don't think that's what it is.
[00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:20.950]  They are desperate.
[00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.492]  The deep state's not in full control anymore.
[00:25:24.493 --> 00:25:30.758]  They're so old school, their own panoptagonic big tech system they built is
[00:25:31.385 --> 00:25:40.352]  Now basically exposing them and backfiring on them and the complexity of the world has made it to where they can't kill everybody or threaten everybody or control everybody.
[00:25:40.413 --> 00:25:46.097]  Plus, America and the world 10-20 years ago was asleep predominantly.
[00:25:47.098 --> 00:25:54.724]  And so because we were asleep predominantly, they thought that we were being quiet because we've been bullied.
[00:25:55.865 --> 00:25:56.586]  Now that the world's
[00:25:57.404 --> 00:26:05.412]  More awake, they're bullying more than ever, but the bullying is only accelerating people becoming awake and getting really, really angry.
[00:26:05.472 --> 00:26:11.659]  So the big news when we come back, we're going to elaborate on the surprise, surprise.
[00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:13.921]  They didn't just take him off suicide watch.
[00:26:15.142 --> 00:26:16.504]  They didn't just put him in a jail cell alone.
[00:26:16.524 --> 00:26:17.344]  You're not supposed to do.
[00:26:18.626 --> 00:26:20.588]  They don't have any video.
[00:26:21.437 --> 00:26:23.078]  The video camera was turned off magically.
[00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:24.839]  The guards were told to go home early.
[00:26:25.099 --> 00:26:29.102]  They were told don't even check on him every 30 minutes like you do every person's cell.
[00:26:29.622 --> 00:26:31.943]  Not every 10 minutes like you're supposed to do on Suicide Watch.
[00:26:32.844 --> 00:26:33.725]  And it gets worse than that.
[00:26:34.865 --> 00:26:45.752]  They have hired the JFK famous magic bullet doctor who in the congressional hearings found that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone
[00:26:46.503 --> 00:26:53.128]  And who signed off on the autopsies of JFK when JFK's brain was completely blown out.
[00:26:54.149 --> 00:27:03.916]  And I've had all the witnesses on the funeral home head on who was actually there when the FBI came in with the rifle with ink on it and put his fingerprint on the gun in front of him.
[00:27:04.516 --> 00:27:08.559]  By the way, the day after he was on the show, they ran him off the road in Austin, tried to kill him.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:09.680]  Sad issue.
[00:27:10.481 --> 00:27:12.102]  But he's a famous, I don't even know if he's alive.
[00:27:12.142 --> 00:27:13.523]  He's like 90 something when he came on the show.
[00:27:14.267 --> 00:27:16.909]  And ended up having funeral homes all over Texas, becoming very rich.
[00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:21.132]  He only had one funeral home in Dallas when that happened in 1963.
[00:27:21.192 --> 00:27:30.078]  But all of this is beyond Lee Harvey Oswald being shot by Jack Ruby at the Dallas police station, where the cops walk him out, hold him up so he can get shot.
[00:27:31.079 --> 00:27:36.102]  And they have done this in front of God, in front of country, in front of the whole world.
[00:27:36.262 --> 00:27:40.005]  But in the backdrop, they had sold us out to the Chi-Coms, the Clintons had.
[00:27:40.635 --> 00:27:43.597]  And so now the Chi-Coms are cut off predominantly from the U.S.
[00:27:43.637 --> 00:27:44.018]  government.
[00:27:44.418 --> 00:27:50.582]  They're trying to run Hollywood and their stay-behind networks, the Democratic Party, Antifa, their Confucius Institutes.
[00:27:51.023 --> 00:27:53.204]  But more and more, they're losing ground.
[00:27:53.464 --> 00:27:54.485]  They're losing control.
[00:27:54.845 --> 00:27:56.086]  So they're beginning to panic.
[00:27:56.707 --> 00:27:59.149]  And now you're seeing absolute desperation.
[00:27:59.169 --> 00:28:06.714]  A lot of people are looking at photos of Epstein and supposedly on the stretcher and saying, oh, that's clearly taken from another photo.
[00:28:06.794 --> 00:28:07.775]  It's been photoshopped.
[00:28:08.345 --> 00:28:09.185]  Who knows what's true?
[00:28:09.445 --> 00:28:13.847]  We've all been lied to so much that it's reasonable to say he's still alive and with his protection program.
[00:28:14.167 --> 00:28:16.628]  It's reasonable to say he was, you know, murdered.
[00:28:17.349 --> 00:28:27.573]  Very suspicious to say he was suicided because they all stood down and every default option, every standing operating procedure
[00:28:28.838 --> 00:28:29.959]  Was turned off.
[00:28:30.139 --> 00:28:32.782]  All these switches were turned off to let this happen.
[00:28:33.242 --> 00:28:35.464]  I had a gut level, Owen, I'll ask you what you think when we come back.
[00:28:35.484 --> 00:28:42.049]  I think that he probably is dead, because dead men tell no tales, plus it sends a message to everybody else, keep your mouth shut.
[00:28:42.069 --> 00:28:49.355]  But make no mistake, the quickening is here, things are only going to get crazy from this point on, and InfoWars was supposed to be off the air by now.
[00:28:49.796 --> 00:28:51.497]  Do the lists if you want to keep us alive.
[00:28:51.797 --> 00:28:55.861]  You are the InfoWar, you are the resistance, and I think you all will stay with us for the ride back.
[00:29:18.261 --> 00:29:21.241]  No one can doubt that InfoWars has changed the world.
[00:29:21.781 --> 00:29:27.823]  The globalists give us credit for discrediting their world government system, their neoliberal fascist plan,
[00:29:28.923 --> 00:29:35.084]  And infecting, in their words, the entire world with nationalism.
[00:29:35.104 --> 00:29:36.865]  Now, how did I do that?
[00:29:38.025 --> 00:29:39.145]  I did that because of you.
[00:29:39.725 --> 00:29:40.285]  We did that.
[00:29:40.766 --> 00:29:41.326]  You did that.
[00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:44.026]  We're either going to have freedom or we're going to have slavery.
[00:29:44.766 --> 00:29:48.207]  And these corporatists play nation states off against each other.
[00:29:48.767 --> 00:29:50.168]  They play men and women off against each other.
[00:29:50.188 --> 00:29:52.808]  They play people off against each other for what color their skin is.
[00:29:53.868 --> 00:29:57.029]  But the people of the world, more and more, are seeing through it.
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:16.255]  And that's why I want all of you right now, as the world government falls apart, as the New World Order hits the panic button and tries to start a race war, to realize that we have come so far, and that all these globalists have now is trying to stir up internal information warfare fights.
[00:30:17.235 --> 00:30:23.701]  But we knew history, and knew that these globalists are arrogant, and there would come a time when their system
[00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:25.211]  We're good to go.
[00:30:37.995 --> 00:30:49.662]  Showing you the infrastructure here, showing you what goes into it, showing you how much money it costs to run this and do this, especially since we were deplatformed one year ago today.
[00:30:49.682 --> 00:30:56.165]  That's why we're calling it the one-year anniversary of the first domino to be unpersoned, to be sent into a black hole, the Phantom Zone.
[00:30:56.245 --> 00:30:58.206]  But the globalists did it too early!
[00:30:58.507 --> 00:31:05.671]  There's still talk radio, there's still TV, there's still independent websites like Infowars.com and Newswars.com that are on the air.
[00:31:06.811 --> 00:31:17.781]  And people have word of mouth to say, hey, just because you can't say Alex Jones's name on Facebook, unless it's a negative statement, or can't show InfoWars.com, you can tell your office about InfoWars.com.
[00:31:18.301 --> 00:31:20.203]  You can tell your neighbors about NewsWars.com.
[00:31:20.843 --> 00:31:22.805]  You can share our videos and our articles.
[00:31:22.825 --> 00:31:23.546]  We have our own site.
[00:31:23.566 --> 00:31:24.286]  We have our own platform.
[00:31:25.507 --> 00:31:27.969]  That's the beauty of what's happening here.
[00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:31.192]  That's the beauty of what's unfolding.
[00:31:31.913 --> 00:31:32.954]  And it's a real fight.
[00:31:34.079 --> 00:31:39.441]  And things aren't going to go the way this whole synthetic technocracy want them to go, because you've been standing in the gap.
[00:31:40.221 --> 00:31:41.141]  You've been spreading the word.
[00:31:41.702 --> 00:31:42.362]  You've been praying.
[00:31:42.982 --> 00:31:44.342]  You've been supporting this transmission.
[00:31:44.422 --> 00:31:45.563]  You've been buying products from us.
[00:31:45.583 --> 00:31:47.824]  So it's the one-year anniversary.

[00:31:56.847 --> 00:31:57.707]  Double Patriot points.
[00:31:57.827 --> 00:32:00.089]  And there's a bunch of other big specials on storable food.
[00:32:00.269 --> 00:32:03.011]  Anniversary sale at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:32:14.841 --> 00:32:20.645]  It is such a revolutionary act every time you put a bumper sticker on your car or paint InfoWars.com on the side of your barn.
[00:32:20.805 --> 00:32:22.366]  Every time you stand up to leftist police.
[00:32:22.526 --> 00:32:23.747]  Every time you tell the truth.
[00:32:23.907 --> 00:32:28.410]  Every time you keep this symbol of free speech and pro-human values alive.
[00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.472]  The enemy comes one step closer to their system falling.
[00:32:31.612 --> 00:32:35.214]  We have pushed them into overreaching and showing their hand.
[00:32:36.015 --> 00:32:40.098]  And now we've got a fighting chance if we all take action of defeating the globalists.
[00:32:40.518 --> 00:32:40.958]  Stay with us.
[00:32:41.198 --> 00:32:41.779]  We'll be right back.
[00:32:41.799 --> 00:32:43.440]  But please take advantage of the sale.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.621]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:16.165 --> 00:33:18.326]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:18.826 --> 00:33:23.929]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:28.246 --> 00:33:31.328]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Monday edition.
[00:33:31.429 --> 00:33:34.311]  I'm Alex Jones, here with you from San Diego, California.
[00:33:34.331 --> 00:33:37.894]  Owen Troyer is in the main studios in the ATX.
[00:33:38.854 --> 00:33:42.217]  And of course, again, we have Bob Barnes joining us at the start of the next hour.
[00:33:42.777 --> 00:33:50.383]  Then we have an amazing reporter from Breitbart who I was familiar with, but I heard him on the air yesterday on the Sunday show with Tom Pappert.
[00:33:51.064 --> 00:33:55.227]  And just, he knows more about this stuff than I do because it's his beat.
[00:33:55.868 --> 00:34:00.830]  And so I've learned all this stuff about Epstein, but then I forget about a lot of it because I'm covering everything.
[00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:06.031]  He mainly covers this, and you couldn't have a better guest than that gentleman that's coming up.
[00:34:06.912 --> 00:34:10.773]  Then we're going to have Paul Joseph Watson, and I do want to open the phones up.
[00:34:11.993 --> 00:34:14.754]  Watson's only on for two segments at the start of the third hour.
[00:34:14.794 --> 00:34:22.357]  We should really just open the phones up after that and then go into the second part of that into the fourth hour because Watson's not hosting.
[00:34:23.215 --> 00:34:24.115]  The fourth hour today.
[00:34:24.135 --> 00:34:25.056]  He's doing that on Wednesday.
[00:34:25.116 --> 00:34:30.238]  But regardless, we really do need to open the phones up and get the caller's take on all of this.
[00:34:30.258 --> 00:34:36.320]  Because this is something that I know no one that we're talking to and no one I even see in the media is buying this.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.041]  And the Attorney General's not buying it.
[00:34:38.061 --> 00:34:42.142]  And Al Green of Texas isn't buying it.
[00:34:43.003 --> 00:34:49.005]  As Al Green said, he said, listen, if they're in video of this, there's supposed to be video on those cells.
[00:34:49.045 --> 00:34:49.885]  You know there's a cover-up.
[00:34:50.265 --> 00:34:50.966]  Well, guess what?
[00:34:50.986 --> 00:34:51.686]  There's no video.
[00:34:52.276 --> 00:34:55.618]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:58.180]  So this is the big awakening.
[00:34:58.521 --> 00:35:02.123]  There's been lots of steps on this path, but this broke the back.
[00:35:02.643 --> 00:35:04.004]  This just went way too far.
[00:35:04.165 --> 00:35:10.829]  And now, now they've gone completely insane, saying, oh, the video cameras were turned off.
[00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:16.313]  The jail guards were told don't check his room every 30 minutes, even though all jail cells are checked every 30 minutes.
[00:35:17.574 --> 00:35:18.575]  It goes further than that.
[00:35:20.493 --> 00:35:33.623]  Now, the famous JFK coroner has been pulled out of mothballs that put out the ridiculous garbage that JFK had only been shot the number of times they said when his brain had been blown out the back of his head.
[00:35:34.323 --> 00:35:36.425]  And the original coroner reports and all of it said that.
[00:35:37.226 --> 00:35:42.489]  I've even interviewed his mortician, JFK's mortician.
[00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:43.991]  I've even interviewed
[00:35:45.177 --> 00:35:46.678]  Lee Harvey Oswald's mortician.
[00:35:46.698 --> 00:35:49.560]  I mean, we've just had him all on the show.
[00:35:50.001 --> 00:35:53.283]  And Jim Mars, God bless his soul, who interviewed all the experts.
[00:35:53.603 --> 00:35:55.325]  He was the guy that kept getting me all those great guests.
[00:35:55.825 --> 00:35:57.186]  And now they've done something.
[00:35:57.767 --> 00:36:01.209]  I'd say this is Kennedy assassination cover up to the next level.
[00:36:01.269 --> 00:36:02.630]  I mean, this is squared.
[00:36:03.071 --> 00:36:11.417]  This is like a Richter scale where every point on the Richter scale is an entire power of magnitude stronger.
[00:36:12.478 --> 00:36:13.959]  And so a whole point
[00:36:14.738 --> 00:36:17.740]  On the Richter scale is 10 times that.
[00:36:17.841 --> 00:36:22.925]  I mean, this is just seismic, insane, crazy.
[00:36:24.026 --> 00:36:24.926]  What are they doing?
[00:36:26.267 --> 00:36:28.509]  And then it gets worse after all of that.
[00:36:28.609 --> 00:36:42.641]  All over the world, from France to England, to Germany, to Israel, criminal investigations are being opened because Jeffrey Epstein was a industrial level procurer of young women
[00:36:43.424 --> 00:36:45.105]  Four rich, powerful men.
[00:36:45.145 --> 00:36:47.847]  He started out doing it at a very, very young age.
[00:36:48.307 --> 00:36:55.511]  Didn't even have the college degree, but was allowed to teach at an elite school where they were corrupting the children.
[00:36:56.212 --> 00:36:56.972]  That's all come out.
[00:36:57.713 --> 00:37:02.455]  And then he began to procure hundreds of girls a year by the 80s.
[00:37:02.876 --> 00:37:04.917]  Then thousands of girls a year, reportedly.
[00:37:05.297 --> 00:37:08.959]  And he had, again, children being smuggled in even younger than 12 or 13.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:26.915]  Buy smugglers to the Caribbean Island, running them up to the buildings, getting them in, and believe me, from our intel, and I talked about this 10 years ago, told you about the island when nobody else would, they weren't just having sex with them down in those tombs and down in those dungeons, let me tell you.
[00:37:27.455 --> 00:37:35.562]  That's just the entry level in the club, is you have sex with underage people, then it's sex with children, and then it's kill them deader than a hammer.
[00:37:36.083 --> 00:37:37.064]  This is vampirism.
[00:37:37.694 --> 00:37:41.516]  And again, this is coming to you from the folks that first broke it on a big scale.
[00:37:42.097 --> 00:37:47.920]  I was told this by high-level retired FBI agents, by, um, what is it?
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.121]  What are three-star generals?
[00:37:50.742 --> 00:37:51.402]  Major generals?
[00:37:51.983 --> 00:38:03.990]  The whole point is, is that, is that I used to hear this 25 years ago from conferences I would go to and when I have these people on the air, when I'd go see somebody give a speech and I'd
[00:38:04.684 --> 00:38:06.285]  Then they call me and say, let's go get dinner.
[00:38:06.305 --> 00:38:12.010]  And they tell me, well, you know, the Satanists really run the communists, but the public can't handle it.
[00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:14.312]  And they're using this to corrupt and take over.
[00:38:14.432 --> 00:38:15.693]  And then it's just all coming out.
[00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:16.454]  It's all true.
[00:38:16.854 --> 00:38:17.135]  Okay.
[00:38:17.155 --> 00:38:21.078]  So I understand why people can't believe this.
[00:38:22.159 --> 00:38:23.780]  I understand why people can't deal with it.
[00:38:24.121 --> 00:38:25.161]  I understand all of that.
[00:38:25.362 --> 00:38:31.487]  When I learned that PETA sacrifices dogs on the upper story of their building,
[00:38:32.598 --> 00:38:36.359]  I thought that the person that told me was crazy.
[00:38:37.399 --> 00:38:37.919]  But guess what?
[00:38:38.419 --> 00:38:39.339]  It wasn't crazy.
[00:38:39.499 --> 00:38:39.960]  It was true.
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:41.340]  Okay.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.941]  And I'm not going to get into all that for personal reasons, but it's very, very personal.
[00:38:45.201 --> 00:38:45.961]  It's been in the news.
[00:38:46.541 --> 00:38:48.661]  What I told people over a decade ago has been confirmed.
[00:38:49.141 --> 00:38:53.662]  But I thought that this person that I knew had gone crazy.
[00:38:54.422 --> 00:39:01.124]  I didn't believe it until we got called by private investigators and Regnery Publishing and others.
[00:39:01.524 --> 00:39:02.084]  And they said,
[00:39:02.878 --> 00:39:04.759]  Do you know who this person is in your family?
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:06.941]  And I said, no, I do not know this.
[00:39:07.681 --> 00:39:08.982]  And they said, well, you better ask him.
[00:39:10.183 --> 00:39:14.666]  And I asked and it was, and it was like, yeah, and it's terrible.
[00:39:14.686 --> 00:39:16.307]  And that's why they got out of it.
[00:39:16.747 --> 00:39:24.712]  But I mean, you hear this stuff from former head FBI agent over the LA sector or from a three-star general, or you hear it from these people over and over again.
[00:39:25.813 --> 00:39:31.717]  And then you find out how close it is, even to you, just some weird PETA spinoff of it.
[00:39:32.955 --> 00:39:42.939]  Of them making all the PETA employees go out to animal shelters and get dogs and cats so they can like get off on injecting them and killing them and then throwing them in trash cans en masse.
[00:39:43.719 --> 00:39:46.721]  And again, I'm just telling you this because this is how insane these people are.
[00:39:47.781 --> 00:39:55.164]  Dr. Peter Singer, that's the head of PETA, the main advisor of it over Ingrid Newhouse, whatever her name is.
[00:39:56.528 --> 00:39:58.190]  He says, kill babies up to age three.
[00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:59.591]  He wrote that 30 years ago.
[00:39:59.771 --> 00:40:02.313]  Now the left says that to us on camera.
[00:40:02.353 --> 00:40:03.254]  We go to their events.
[00:40:04.475 --> 00:40:08.919]  Normal women in business suits and clothes walk up and go, ah, InfoWars.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.222]  We're going to kill babies up to age three.
[00:40:12.242 --> 00:40:16.826]  You have to understand, folks, that I understand why none of this sounds real.
[00:40:17.306 --> 00:40:23.011]  None of this sounds possible, because I never get sick of iced tea and the enchiladas I had last night.
[00:40:23.641 --> 00:40:26.044]  I never get sick of, you know, my wife.
[00:40:26.604 --> 00:40:28.626]  I would never even want to hurt a child.
[00:40:29.167 --> 00:40:34.832]  I would never want to go do stuff that I guess the Pope's talked about, that he thinks about all the time.
[00:40:35.073 --> 00:40:36.134]  Eating feces and things.
[00:40:36.995 --> 00:40:44.342]  But you have to understand, these people and the spirits that are in them want to degradate the human spirit.
[00:40:45.003 --> 00:40:49.644]  These people want to pull down the human spirit dimensionally so that we don't go with God.
[00:40:50.165 --> 00:40:50.825]  It's a ritual.
[00:40:50.885 --> 00:40:53.146]  And again, I go back to this allegory, which is perfect.
[00:40:53.666 --> 00:40:56.487]  Eddie Murphy's good film, The Golden Child.
[00:40:57.087 --> 00:40:58.287]  The Satanists are in L.A.
[00:40:58.987 --> 00:41:04.209]  sacrificing children to torture them so that the blood is corrupt.
[00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:12.252]  Then they put the blood of tortured children in the oatmeal to try to get the golden child to symbolize this humanity's ascension in a more New Agey way.
[00:41:12.272 --> 00:41:13.432]  It's Christ's figure.
[00:41:14.181 --> 00:41:17.784]  Because they're unable to physically kill him until they've corrupted his body.
[00:41:18.685 --> 00:41:34.418]  So that's what the 5G and the GMO and the vaccines and all the stuff on TV and the, you know, the cigarette additives and all the liquor and all the drugs and all the Prozac and all of it is meant to enslave us and bind us down and control us.
[00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:36.040]  So Jeffrey Epstein is key.
[00:41:37.208 --> 00:41:42.070]  Because he was a pimp, and a procurer, and a frontman, a concierge.
[00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:48.954]  In fact, Epstein was a concierge of trauma-based mind control, of Satanism, and of corruption.
[00:41:49.254 --> 00:41:54.636]  And the Clintons were Renfield managers above him.
[00:41:55.397 --> 00:41:56.097]  Just look at them.
[00:41:56.837 --> 00:41:58.118]  For the royalty.
[00:41:59.099 --> 00:42:03.901]  For the most powerful families in the world, who I will assure you, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:42:04.517 --> 00:42:04.877]  Are you?
[00:42:27.344 --> 00:42:31.448]  You have to understand that the angel of death, Joseph Mengele, wrote in his own diary.
[00:42:31.968 --> 00:42:33.009]  He was German royalty.
[00:42:33.369 --> 00:42:36.392]  He would just go pick out a bunch of little five-year-old kids out of concentration camp.
[00:42:36.412 --> 00:42:37.113]  That was his favorite.
[00:42:38.054 --> 00:42:40.196]  Feed them a bunch of chocolates for whatever reason.
[00:42:41.056 --> 00:42:43.919]  Then drive them out in the field himself and just shoot them in the head every morning.
[00:42:44.517 --> 00:42:47.080]  This is Scott LaPoffe, which is draining their energy.
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:48.301]  These are vampires.
[00:42:48.321 --> 00:42:52.826]  We'll be right back to break down how the whole house of cards can come down if you want it to.
[00:42:53.287 --> 00:42:54.988]  InfoWars.com, NewsWorks.com.
[00:42:55.048 --> 00:42:59.674]  Tomorrow's news today, Owen Schroer rides shotgun to spread the word about the transmission.
[00:42:59.834 --> 00:43:00.755]  The Globals hope he won't.
[00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:14.337]  We just passed the August 6th one-year anniversary of the historic event where all of Big Tech working in concert banned InfoWars and Alex Jones off the internet.
[00:43:14.357 --> 00:43:18.380]  Well, Alex Jones has been banned on all tech platforms.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.420]  Nobody said anything.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.722]  So Big Tech's language police are getting bolder.
[00:43:21.782 --> 00:43:28.026]  Now four media giants are banding together to take down controversial InfoWars content from their site.
[00:43:28.206 --> 00:43:35.150]  YouTube, Facebook, and Apple all announcing they're removing his content from their platforms.
[00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:48.817]  But by the grace of God and via Matt Drudge's warning and others' warnings, we have helped build our own infrastructure, our own video, our own audio, our own news gathering system at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:43:49.157 --> 00:43:51.558]  And it's all because of your support.
[00:43:51.918 --> 00:43:52.959]  This is the house you built.
[00:43:53.519 --> 00:43:59.166]  I want to play a few minutes of just a sampling of the demonization and the lies of a year ago.
[00:43:59.607 --> 00:44:07.196]  And then I want to play a few minutes of what's happening currently as thousands and thousands of prominent people are completely banned and unpersoned as well.
[00:44:07.697 --> 00:44:11.862]  And as hundreds of millions of accounts of people following
[00:44:12.623 --> 00:44:17.647]  Popular meme sites and other sites on Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube are being deleted.
[00:44:18.148 --> 00:44:23.872]  That's hundreds of millions of followers not being able to choose what content they see.
[00:44:24.653 --> 00:44:25.453]  This is outrageous.
[00:44:26.074 --> 00:44:27.155]  That's incredibly dangerous.
[00:44:28.076 --> 00:44:29.597]  But it's the day and age that we live in.
[00:44:30.357 --> 00:44:34.781]  Thank God we built InfoWars so there'd be some voice in the midst of this.
[00:44:35.401 --> 00:44:37.703]  And that's why it's so important to remember before we play these clips that
[00:44:38.891 --> 00:44:42.873]  Without your word of mouth, and without you spreading the word, no one knows we're still here and still on air.
[00:44:43.233 --> 00:44:45.814]  Thanks to you doing that, we're coming back from the dead.
[00:44:46.774 --> 00:44:49.315]  And without your financial support, we won't be here either.
[00:44:49.775 --> 00:45:00.780]  So please check out the huge sales we have running, the Banniversary Sale, 50-60% off all the supplements, 50% off water filtration, air filtration, storable food, store-wide free shipping, and double Patriot Points, and a lot more.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.581]  So be sure and visit InfoRestore.com.
[00:45:03.941 --> 00:45:08.123]  Now let's go to the folks that tell us that we need to be banned, we need to be silenced, that we need to be shut down.
[00:45:08.783 --> 00:45:12.124]  And that, well, chief among those is yours truly, Alex Jones.
[00:45:12.564 --> 00:45:15.284]  Yesterday, Alex Jones became an un-person.
[00:45:15.604 --> 00:45:21.326]  Apple last night removed the entire library of Alex Jones' podcasts from their store.
[00:45:21.426 --> 00:45:27.827]  The conspiracy theories are beyond the realm, are not only beyond being offensive, they're dangerous.
[00:45:27.907 --> 00:45:37.329]  And we don't do enough in telling people out there right now this morning, people who read newspapers, exactly who these people are and what they believe.
[00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:38.649]  I want them shut down.
[00:45:38.709 --> 00:45:39.629]  I want them silenced.
[00:45:39.669 --> 00:45:40.470]  I want them muted.
[00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:42.330]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:51.652]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[00:45:51.952 --> 00:46:00.834]  Even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform conservatives from the internet and communicating with each other, just like communist China.
[00:46:00.954 --> 00:46:02.374]  And we're also standing up
[00:46:03.416 --> 00:46:06.117]  To social media censorship.
[00:46:06.157 --> 00:46:07.017]  That's the new thing.
[00:46:07.258 --> 00:46:13.480]  People at home could go and search, say, Alex Jones, a prominent InfoWars.com media broadcaster.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:19.122]  If you go to DuckDuckGo or you go to Bing and you search Alex Jones, you'll find InfoWars in a mix of articles.
[00:46:19.523 --> 00:46:23.304]  If you go to Google, you won't even find his main broadcasting station, InfoWars.
[00:46:23.404 --> 00:46:25.565]  Instead, you'll just find a bunch of negative hit pieces.
[00:46:25.805 --> 00:46:31.308]  Conservatives are feeling the heavy hand of censorship in the United States and across Western Europe.
[00:46:31.388 --> 00:46:37.771]  Their social media accounts are being banned, blocked, and cancelled on Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook.
[00:46:37.911 --> 00:46:44.374]  And in 2020, you can bet that all of these companies are going to go all out.
[00:46:44.954 --> 00:46:48.716]  And the methods that they're using are invisible.
[00:46:48.796 --> 00:46:50.017]  They're subliminal.
[00:46:50.317 --> 00:46:52.318]  They're more powerful than...
[00:46:53.259 --> 00:47:09.119]  Most any effects I've ever seen in the behavioral sciences and I've been in the behavioral sciences for almost 40 years InfoWars tomorrow's news today You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[00:47:24.196 --> 00:47:26.237]  What is Jeffrey Epstein's greatest secret?
[00:47:26.437 --> 00:47:36.819]  It's not just that he was an international procurer of underage girls or children so they could blackmail world leaders for a corporate worldwide government system.
[00:47:37.019 --> 00:47:37.939]  That's all been confirmed.
[00:47:38.739 --> 00:47:47.101]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's the ultimate taboo that every civilization in its declining, waning twilight days engages in.
[00:47:48.702 --> 00:47:50.222]  Human sacrifice of children.
[00:47:51.886 --> 00:47:55.028]  No, vampires that live for thousands of years aren't real.
[00:47:56.209 --> 00:48:01.732]  But the spirits that fill these husks, these servants of evil, do.
[00:48:02.413 --> 00:48:02.893]  They're eternal.
[00:48:04.294 --> 00:48:06.595]  And that's where you get the legend of the vampire.
[00:48:06.715 --> 00:48:09.137]  And they are kidnapping and torturing children.
[00:48:09.958 --> 00:48:11.819]  And some they turn into minions and servants.
[00:48:12.599 --> 00:48:16.862]  And that's a lot of the Rimfield types that you actually see, like the Hillarys and the Bills.
[00:48:17.793 --> 00:48:19.154]  They themselves have been abused.
[00:48:19.174 --> 00:48:25.599]  And of course, you know, both of them have been abused, but they decided they love the dark side and drank deeply from it.
[00:48:25.939 --> 00:48:28.761]  So that's Jeffrey Epstein's big secret.
[00:48:29.521 --> 00:48:30.802]  And it could bring down the whole system.
[00:48:30.822 --> 00:48:32.123]  It could bring down the whole house of cards.
[00:48:33.664 --> 00:48:38.448]  If it continues to roll up the witnesses and the individuals and all these documents that came out last week confirmed.
[00:48:39.308 --> 00:48:43.051]  We have an expert on this coming up in about 40 minutes after Robert Barnes comes on.
[00:48:44.032 --> 00:48:45.753]  All of this confirms, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:49.632]  That Bill Clinton was on the island and lied about it.
[00:48:50.673 --> 00:49:02.161]  And the island again has the underground temples, the dungeons, all of this is coming out and Epstein is only one manager of a whole network of these facilities.
[00:49:02.722 --> 00:49:11.688]  That's why these are all big compounds and why on the islands they have these big women's retreats and Disney cruises would stop at the island.
[00:49:11.849 --> 00:49:12.409]  Look that up.
[00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:13.870]  Can't make that up.
[00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:14.851]  And other
[00:49:15.903 --> 00:49:20.107]  Events would go on at his huge New Mexico compound that's set up like a college.
[00:49:21.107 --> 00:49:24.931]  Just like Penn State had this big organization run by Sandusky.
[00:49:26.512 --> 00:49:29.935]  And they would bring abused children who'd already been raped.
[00:49:30.355 --> 00:49:31.696]  Some as young as seven.
[00:49:33.037 --> 00:49:38.562]  Because if they did medical exams on them, they couldn't tell who'd raped them because they've already been raped.
[00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:42.345]  So they would bring rape victims to Sandusky by the hundreds a year.
[00:49:43.345 --> 00:49:53.049]  And then they would have high-powered donors come and mentor them and stay at good-sized mansions with the children, sometimes for weeks.
[00:49:53.989 --> 00:49:55.910]  And so it's just the renting out of children.
[00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:59.751]  But everybody in the power structure wants to social climb.
[00:50:00.231 --> 00:50:02.572]  So they go and have sex with the kids to be in the club.
[00:50:03.172 --> 00:50:05.073]  But then they get recruited to the next level.
[00:50:07.654 --> 00:50:09.235]  And again, it's just like Eyes Wide Shut.
[00:50:09.535 --> 00:50:10.415]  You get taken to it.
[00:50:11.192 --> 00:50:12.393]  There's a woman in a ritual.
[00:50:12.874 --> 00:50:13.454]  She dies.
[00:50:13.674 --> 00:50:14.595]  Oh, it's an overdose.
[00:50:16.377 --> 00:50:18.139]  You're now involved in murdering somebody.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:19.600]  Oh, don't worry.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:20.281]  She's just a hooker.
[00:50:21.542 --> 00:50:23.044]  Next, it's a 15-year-old boy.
[00:50:23.964 --> 00:50:27.788]  And this is the... When you look in the eyes of these people, they look so psychotic.
[00:50:28.729 --> 00:50:29.490]  They look so evil.
[00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:32.513]  Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:50:33.308 --> 00:50:37.411]  When you look in the eyes of the Democratic Party and why they look so evil and why they're so bad?
[00:50:37.671 --> 00:50:42.174]  Because they've all taken part, at least, in the cover-up of the abuse.
[00:50:42.614 --> 00:50:45.375]  CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, all of them.
[00:50:46.596 --> 00:50:52.840]  They are complicit in demonizing and attacking anybody that talks about it, in creating fake stories.
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:54.221]  That was mainstream news.
[00:50:54.681 --> 00:50:57.503]  Diverting us off to the pizza parlor in D.C.
[00:50:57.603 --> 00:50:59.844]  away from the spirit cooking and all the proof.
[00:51:03.151 --> 00:51:12.179]  The brother of John Podesta, Tony Podesta, in the Washington Post in 2007, saying, I've got child porn.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:14.741]  I've got a dungeon I watch videos in.
[00:51:14.821 --> 00:51:15.602]  I'll do what I want.
[00:51:15.622 --> 00:51:17.724]  I can't even show you the photos of that.
[00:51:17.944 --> 00:51:19.766]  It's child porn they put in the Washington Post.
[00:51:20.026 --> 00:51:25.831]  You throw it in your face to get you used to it, and you look at Tony Podesta, he looks more like a demon.
[00:51:26.591 --> 00:51:28.753]  He could be in a Ghostbusters movie as a goblin.
[00:51:30.405 --> 00:51:32.486]  Because that's the spirit that's in them.
[00:51:32.746 --> 00:51:35.666]  When you do things like this, it turns you over to them.
[00:51:36.187 --> 00:51:42.508]  Images of children hanging off meat hooks in big shower dungeon areas where you hose their guts off when you're done.
[00:51:43.048 --> 00:51:49.510]  These are absolute savage individuals, just full of pure evil.
[00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:59.433]  When they're on those stages with university professors, they're on those stages on CNN, and the other sickos are bowing to them, they are bowing to them saying, I want to be deeper in the cult.
[00:52:00.134 --> 00:52:00.776]  I want to come.
[00:52:01.377 --> 00:52:02.780]  I want to have the walnut sauce.
[00:52:03.261 --> 00:52:04.324]  I want to be part of it.
[00:52:04.725 --> 00:52:06.108]  I want to be in the pool with the kids.
[00:52:06.569 --> 00:52:07.852]  I want to... on and on and on.
[00:52:09.437 --> 00:52:11.759]  When you look at any of these people, they know what they're part of.
[00:52:11.979 --> 00:52:15.783]  So the biggest takeaway is, this media complex aren't just liars, folks.
[00:52:15.923 --> 00:52:16.904]  They love it.
[00:52:17.144 --> 00:52:20.807]  They love saying, kill millions of people for the new world order.
[00:52:20.847 --> 00:52:23.910]  They love overthrowing Libya and destabilizing all of Africa.
[00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:26.452]  They love destroying stable governments, bringing in evil.
[00:52:26.853 --> 00:52:28.394]  They are a legion of evil.
[00:52:28.534 --> 00:52:34.740]  Owen Troyer, I have to tell you, getting on the plane, I talked about this Sunday,
[00:52:36.204 --> 00:52:37.985]  People were all saying, hey, did you hear Epstein died?
[00:52:38.025 --> 00:52:38.686]  Alex is incredible.
[00:52:38.726 --> 00:52:41.108]  They murdered him because we just got the news before we got on the plane.
[00:52:41.128 --> 00:52:42.529]  I shot a video before we got on the plane.
[00:52:43.329 --> 00:52:47.893]  And Democrats were going, good, Hillary needs to be tough so that people fear her.
[00:52:48.013 --> 00:52:49.234]  Trump doesn't have any respect.
[00:52:49.594 --> 00:52:50.815]  Good, I'm glad Epstein's dead.
[00:52:50.835 --> 00:52:54.938]  And there were Democrats, a lot of them, you know, clean cut, older, dressed nice.
[00:52:55.878 --> 00:52:58.060]  Husbands and wives just looking at me, just nodding, going,
[00:52:59.102 --> 00:53:00.543]  Like they were feeling powerful.
[00:53:02.385 --> 00:53:07.469]  They had taken the devil's spirit, not the Holy Spirit, but they'd taken communion, you see.
[00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:11.053]  And I had him out here by the pool a couple days ago.
[00:53:11.073 --> 00:53:15.496]  I was swimming with my daughter and my security guy had just walked off.
[00:53:15.536 --> 00:53:17.578]  I said, yeah, go tell the other security guy he can have off.
[00:53:17.598 --> 00:53:18.299]  I'm about to go up.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:20.080]  And he goes, okay, sure.
[00:53:20.401 --> 00:53:21.041]  He walks off.
[00:53:21.101 --> 00:53:25.085]  They're watching and five yuppies, three women, two men come over.
[00:53:25.836 --> 00:53:29.498]  While I'm in the pool in front of my daughter and say, we hope you commit suicide, kill yourself.
[00:53:29.839 --> 00:53:30.799]  I hope you die.
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.821]  You know, just, just, just all this insane.
[00:53:33.841 --> 00:53:40.326]  And they were just going, I mean, just, just because I'm telling you, they fully taken the spirit.
[00:53:40.866 --> 00:53:41.647]  They've converted.
[00:53:41.847 --> 00:53:44.348]  Anybody's got to go to a Democrat event, folks.
[00:53:44.408 --> 00:53:46.550]  And these people literally walk around.
[00:53:49.332 --> 00:53:50.973]  They have some things happen to them.
[00:53:51.033 --> 00:53:51.633]  Owen Schroeder.
[00:53:52.754 --> 00:53:53.294]  This is huge.
[00:53:53.314 --> 00:53:54.035]  What do you think's happening?
[00:53:54.793 --> 00:54:01.881]  Well, Alex, if you recall, before you took off or before we left here on Friday, you know, we don't have enough time to run around working all the time.
[00:54:01.901 --> 00:54:03.542]  We had kind of a personal conversation.
[00:54:03.582 --> 00:54:07.827]  I said, you know, Alex, every time you try to get away, something crazy happens.
[00:54:07.907 --> 00:54:12.072]  And then sure enough, right before your plane takes off, Jeffrey Epstein is murdered.
[00:54:12.672 --> 00:54:12.892]  And then
[00:54:13.533 --> 00:54:28.080]  You know, as far as Epstein is concerned, I think there's really only two logical conclusions that we can reach right now, Alex, and that was that Jeffrey Epstein was murdered, very powerful forces involved, or he's alive and he was taken out of jail and put into witness protection because of the threats against his life.
[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:32.162]  I think that those are the only two reasonable options right now, Alex, and anybody who thinks he was
[00:54:33.168 --> 00:54:49.219]  Or anybody who thinks he committed suicide and believes this narrative that they're putting out there, which I don't really see anybody except writers for the New York Times and the Washington Post, you know, or commentators at MSNBC or CNN or big globalist news organizations like ABC News and Yahoo.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:57.206]  Other than that, it seems like the average American, you know, anybody in media that has any soul left at all is saying, no, this is a cover-up.
[00:54:57.727 --> 00:54:58.888]  They're lying about what happened.
[00:54:58.908 --> 00:55:00.189]  He definitely didn't commit suicide.
[00:55:00.229 --> 00:55:09.077]  But that's not going to stop the Tokyo Rose, Baghdad Bob, propaganda, mockingbird media from continuing to tell us, oh, it's just a suicide.
[00:55:09.217 --> 00:55:10.959]  Nothing to see here.
[00:55:11.599 --> 00:55:12.660]  So we'll see if there's any answer.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:13.381]  I totally agree with you.
[00:55:13.401 --> 00:55:14.422]  And I'll tell you this, Owen.
[00:55:15.134 --> 00:55:19.076]  You know, I lean towards they really killed him because dead men tell no tales, they want to send a message.
[00:55:19.116 --> 00:55:25.059]  But they're so bold and crazy hiring JFK's coroner that, you know, clearly put out that whole fake report.
[00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:34.124]  And they've turned the cameras off and told the guards to go home early that they probably did just take him out the back of the building and then photoshop an image of him on a stretcher.
[00:55:34.385 --> 00:55:36.466]  I mean, they'll do anything now, Owen.
[00:55:36.766 --> 00:55:37.806]  Why do you think they're doing that?
[00:55:37.846 --> 00:55:40.488]  I think it's because the wheels are coming off and they're losing control.
[00:55:42.386 --> 00:55:47.141]  Well, I think the reason is they see that the public is finally... I mean, the Renaissance is happening.
[00:55:47.422 --> 00:55:48.485]  That's really what this is about.
[00:55:48.725 --> 00:55:49.167]  And so...
[00:55:50.697 --> 00:55:51.617]  This isn't going to work, though.
[00:55:51.677 --> 00:55:55.479]  Trying to tell the world that Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide, the Renaissance isn't believing it anymore.
[00:55:55.539 --> 00:55:57.420]  People are awake, they see that this is going on.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:00.502]  Well, they don't believe it because they turned the cameras off.
[00:56:00.962 --> 00:56:03.223]  Because he was on death watch, they took him off of it.
[00:56:03.243 --> 00:56:05.504]  Then they put him in a cell alone, they weren't supposed to do that.
[00:56:05.824 --> 00:56:08.205]  And then now they're delaying the coroner's report.
[00:56:08.666 --> 00:56:10.927]  And then it just goes on and on and on.
[00:56:10.967 --> 00:56:16.309]  And it's the day after these bombshell documents get exclusively, at first, released here at InfoWars.com.
[00:56:16.329 --> 00:56:17.770]  In fact, let me just say that, because I always forget.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:20.782]  Folks, we want to hire more reporters.
[00:56:20.822 --> 00:56:21.622]  We want to expand.
[00:56:22.062 --> 00:56:26.286]  We're just trusting in God and trusting in you and moving forward with the expansion.
[00:56:26.586 --> 00:56:33.391]  We're working seven days a week here, but we had to end the sale yesterday because a bunch of stuff's selling out.
[00:56:33.631 --> 00:56:36.613]  But I've been so busy with the news, we haven't come up with the new sale yet.
[00:56:36.934 --> 00:56:39.275]  This is the way you can take advantage of these sales when they get extended.
[00:56:41.117 --> 00:56:44.619]  Because this sale, we haven't had to sell this big since Christmas.
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:46.501]  Storewide free shipping.
[00:56:47.699 --> 00:56:50.040]  Double Patriot points, 50 to 60% off.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.161]  And that's how we fund the operation.
[00:56:52.681 --> 00:56:54.342]  The storable foods are still 50% off.
[00:56:54.822 --> 00:56:56.443]  We sold out of the Alexa Pure Pro.
[00:56:56.823 --> 00:56:59.265]  We're about to sell out of the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:56:59.285 --> 00:57:02.566]  We're about to sell out of their pitchers, little pitcher ones that are good as well.
[00:57:03.026 --> 00:57:04.427]  We're selling out of a lot of these products.
[00:57:04.947 --> 00:57:06.208]  We've been sold out for three months.
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.221]  Of the strongest, best krill oil we could find, and the cleanest krill oil.
[00:57:10.342 --> 00:57:11.362]  It's finally back in.
[00:57:11.442 --> 00:57:12.603]  People are big fans of it.
[00:57:13.103 --> 00:57:17.145]  It's 50% off despite that, but I'm going to have to end that sale in probably a week or so.
[00:57:17.205 --> 00:57:22.527]  That's going to be one of the things we're going to extend is the krill oil, but it really is high quality krill oil.
[00:57:22.887 --> 00:57:24.608]  What it does for your brain, your body's amazing.
[00:57:24.688 --> 00:57:26.009]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:57:26.409 --> 00:57:27.749]  Try it before you go to bed at night.
[00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:29.050]  See what happens with your dreams.
[00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:32.612]  It goes with the Ultra 12 really good.
[00:57:33.032 --> 00:57:34.212]  It goes with the Turbo Force.
[00:57:34.853 --> 00:57:35.453]  It's a new product.
[00:57:35.993 --> 00:57:39.255]  I mean, this oil is powerful.
[00:57:39.695 --> 00:57:42.116]  Lungs and cardiovascular in your heart.
[00:57:42.417 --> 00:57:43.157]  It's brain food.
[00:57:43.537 --> 00:57:48.100]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-25-33139.
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:50.401]  Owen, let's finish up when we come back on the other side.
[00:57:53.683 --> 00:58:04.869]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on air 25 years, and I've never at a gut level felt the fire of war like I do
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:16.036]  Right now, ladies and gentlemen, so many incredible things are happening, so many dangerous things are unfolding, and at a cellular level, at a spiritual gut level,
[00:58:17.406 --> 00:58:35.318]  At the heart of my gut, the heart of my mind, at every level, I can just feel the evil rage of the globalists, knowing that their plan for world government, and their plan for total censorship, and their plan for human-animal clones, and sex with children, and Satanism is in trouble.
[00:58:35.438 --> 00:58:38.720]  It can feel the spirit of Christ coming back into the world.
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:39.901]  There's gonna be a tribulation.
[00:58:40.461 --> 00:58:43.784]  During this fight, but the devil knows he's going to lose.
[00:58:44.024 --> 00:58:49.929]  The devil sends the beast with wrath because he knows his time is short, and I can feel Satan's rage.
[00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:52.931]  I know you can feel it, and they are planning a bloody revolution here.
[00:58:53.092 --> 00:58:55.934]  They're planning massive censorship across the country and the world.
[00:58:56.034 --> 00:59:02.559]  This is a time to be praying to Christ for justice and for freedom, and that God's Spirit come into you and lead God and direct you.
[00:59:02.599 --> 00:59:05.602]  But it's also time to be politically and culturally active.
[00:59:05.782 --> 00:59:17.706]  And it's time to spread the word about InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and override the AI sensors to override their systems and to let people know, hey, here's the name that must not be spoken.
[00:59:17.986 --> 00:59:19.207]  Here's what the world fears.
[00:59:19.427 --> 00:59:25.129]  Here's the guest and the information and the history and the analysis that is the cure to the globalist poison.
[00:59:25.249 --> 00:59:26.029]  InfoWars.
[00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:30.111]  Strength lies entirely with you and the action you take.
[00:59:30.351 --> 00:59:31.711]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:59:31.911 --> 00:59:33.112]  You are the resistance.
[00:59:33.652 --> 00:59:38.355]  And everything you do now will affect the battle space where billions of lives go into the future.
[00:59:39.015 --> 00:59:41.417]  The war has already begun, quote Patrick Henry.
[00:59:41.937 --> 00:59:43.578]  It's an information and spiritual war.
[00:59:44.479 --> 00:59:47.160]  The enemy's losing that war so they want to make it a physical war.
[00:59:47.721 --> 00:59:48.901]  So prepare yourselves.
[00:59:49.542 --> 00:59:50.322]  You have been warned.
[00:59:55.485 --> 01:00:01.389]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:09.577 --> 01:00:16.280]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:00:16.521 --> 01:00:18.682]  You better believe you've got one!
[01:00:20.823 --> 01:00:29.267]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.287 --> 01:00:30.187]  Here's Al Green.
[01:00:30.347 --> 01:00:31.128]  He's got questions.
[01:00:31.468 --> 01:00:35.130]  I kind of like the fact that Al Green knows that nobody's buying the official story, and finally,
[01:00:35.754 --> 01:00:37.596]  Even broken clocks are right twice a day.
[01:00:37.636 --> 01:00:42.140]  Here's the Texas congressman that once Trump impeached saying, there better be video of this, release it.
[01:00:42.341 --> 01:00:43.341]  Well, guess what, Al Green?
[01:00:43.702 --> 01:00:45.243]  They turned the video cameras off, buddy.
[01:00:45.564 --> 01:00:46.525]  Welcome to the real world.
[01:00:51.229 --> 01:00:55.510]  When the impossible occurs, we have to act with immediacy.
[01:00:55.971 --> 01:01:12.456]  We need to see the video immediately, and if the video doesn't show us what it should, and there's some technology that failed, Mr. Cavuto, we cannot allow ourselves to believe absurdities, because it will cause us to allow atrocities to be committed.
[01:01:13.297 --> 01:01:15.457]  We have to see what happened immediately.
[01:01:15.477 --> 01:01:16.098]  What are you saying?
[01:01:16.118 --> 01:01:17.118]  Do you think someone killed him?
[01:01:18.737 --> 01:01:19.677]  I don't know what happened.
[01:01:19.957 --> 01:01:21.758]  That's why we have to find out right away.
[01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:28.019]  And we also need to see if there's a video of those who were watching him, who were monitoring him.
[01:01:28.299 --> 01:01:29.579]  We need to see that video.
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:32.300]  This is not supposed to happen.
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:35.281]  We have to know immediately what occurred.
[01:01:35.601 --> 01:01:36.901]  And I thank you for giving me that.
[01:01:37.101 --> 01:01:39.002]  No, it is very strange.
[01:01:39.402 --> 01:01:40.062]  It doesn't add up.
[01:01:41.842 --> 01:01:44.843]  But now, the video cameras were turned off, Owen.
[01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:52.673]  Now they're hiring the JFK cover-up artist that did the whole fake report on the magic bullets and all that in the autopsy.
[01:01:53.134 --> 01:01:56.676]  I mean, this is getting absolutely ridiculous, Owen.
[01:01:57.543 --> 01:02:04.369]  Well, I'm not sure how much I take into the new guy, the famous Dr. Michael Baden, being involved in this.
[01:02:04.389 --> 01:02:08.734]  He's pretty much involved with every high-profile autopsy, and there was already an autopsy done.
[01:02:08.754 --> 01:02:11.836]  The suspicious thing is, why is it being held back right now?
[01:02:12.737 --> 01:02:17.141]  The family requested that Baden get involved, but Alex, here's my thing, listening to Al Green.
[01:02:17.822 --> 01:02:26.868]  They've cooked their own goose here because they tried to turn Epstein Trump into the thing and they tried to flip the Clinton body count to the Trump body count on social media.
[01:02:26.888 --> 01:02:35.714]  So now all of their vitriolic, foaming at the mouth Trump haters are demanding answers into Epstein's death because they essentially think it's going to bring down Trump.
[01:02:36.275 --> 01:02:39.317]  So now you have, clearly now Al Green is just
[01:02:40.097 --> 01:03:02.451]  Sorry to say just a low IQ congressman because he goes out and says Trump is racist and all this crap and you're like wow you must be blackmailed or some agent but now he comes out this he just buys it he just genuinely buys all right let's go further let's go further you just hit something key we've been exposing Epstein for 10 years and 20 years before that this whole globalist pedophile frame up blackmail network but it was Democrats
[01:03:03.425 --> 01:03:18.754]  Suppressing all of our real news about it, but putting out fake stuff about Trump and Epstein that kept it going, that then got all these lawsuits going, because people wanted to defend themselves, that now has brought out all the proof on the Clintons, and they're too stupid to ever think two or three steps ahead.
[01:03:19.234 --> 01:03:27.178]  And so now, just like you said, they suppress Clinton body count, so that everybody pushes Trump body count, but then all they find is the truth about the Clintons.
[01:03:27.638 --> 01:03:29.900]  This is all completely blowing up in their face.
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:31.721]  And here's what's coming next.
[01:03:32.381 --> 01:03:35.684]  Because I think Lisa Bloom and Gloria Alred are too.
[01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:42.351]  I'm not a fan of their politics, but they're pretty much, you know, they smell red meat, they smell blood in the water, so they're going to go after it for these victims.
[01:03:42.691 --> 01:03:50.218]  And now they're going after Giselle Maxwell, and all signs point to she wants to cooperate before they suicide her.
[01:03:50.258 --> 01:03:53.241]  But Alex, I want to get your final comments on this, because
[01:03:53.942 --> 01:03:54.843]  This is where it all goes.
[01:03:54.863 --> 01:03:57.404]  You basically turned into the most credible person in media overnight.
[01:03:57.444 --> 01:04:00.326]  You basically turned from a conspiracy theorist to a biblical prophet overnight.
[01:04:00.366 --> 01:04:06.651]  But this story is in the mirror inside Orgy Island where aristocrats' sex parties eventually ended in murder.
[01:04:06.891 --> 01:04:08.852]  This comes out of an island by Italy.
[01:04:09.232 --> 01:04:12.014]  This is what is going on or was going on at Epstein Island.
[01:04:12.054 --> 01:04:14.596]  And if it all comes out, this is what people are going to find out, Alex.
[01:04:16.597 --> 01:04:19.059]  Well, I mean, I know they kill people on these islands.
[01:04:19.859 --> 01:04:23.602]  And so you're telling me it's in major news now that they're now talking about murdering people?
[01:04:24.212 --> 01:04:26.752]  Yeah, this came out August 9th over the weekend.
[01:04:26.993 --> 01:04:37.795]  Zanoni, which sits off the west coast of Italy between Naples and Rome, was owned by an aristocrat and his wife, and they had all these sex orgies, and it documents in here how many of it ended in murder.
[01:04:39.015 --> 01:04:44.236]  Well, yeah, and that's what I said last segment, is that they have these groups all over the world.
[01:04:44.256 --> 01:04:45.656]  It's eyes wide shut, Alex.
[01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:49.757]  It's Rosemary's Baby or whatever.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:58.532]  Look, I've been told by a lot of high-level Hollywood people, and I'll leave it at that, as high-level as you can get, that this stuff's all real, and that Eyes Wide Shut is a documentary.
[01:04:59.073 --> 01:05:01.677]  I've actually... Cooper's daughter told me it's a documentary.
[01:05:03.493 --> 01:05:16.980]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:19.741]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[01:05:20.141 --> 01:05:21.222]  farming goods a week ago.
[01:05:21.882 --> 01:05:25.544]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[01:05:26.184 --> 01:05:30.107]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[01:05:30.747 --> 01:05:31.308]  That's beautiful.
[01:05:31.768 --> 01:05:33.329]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[01:05:33.689 --> 01:05:34.690]  And we aren't going to back down.
[01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:42.635]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[01:05:42.875 --> 01:05:44.837]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[01:05:45.217 --> 01:05:49.080]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:50.301]  And I'm asking listeners,
[01:05:51.101 --> 01:05:54.889]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:56.071]  We are the resistance.
[01:05:56.312 --> 01:05:57.053]  We are 1776 Worldwide.
[01:06:12.705 --> 01:06:16.587]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:18.228 --> 01:06:20.969]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:23.971 --> 01:06:25.191]  It's Monday, August 12th, 2019.
[01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:27.432]  I'm Alex Jones on the road.
[01:06:27.492 --> 01:06:36.837]  Owen Schroeder is taking over right now with our great legal head counsel, Robert Barnes, who knows the inside baseball on all of this stuff.
[01:06:38.168 --> 01:07:00.861]  And he has privately told me about some of the lawyers and groups out there that get women's cases and then scuttle them claiming that they're advocates for women because in this whole new Epstein assassination or witness protection program or whatever really happened saga that nobody's buying and this huge awakening for the world.
[01:07:00.901 --> 01:07:01.842]  This is one of the biggest ever.
[01:07:03.373 --> 01:07:15.217]  We have to ask, what's the next phase of the cover-up as it comes out that these orgy islands are all over the world, as Owen was just covering, and that they are actually killing people in rituals at these?
[01:07:15.817 --> 01:07:26.560]  I remember reading that in the London Guardian 25 years ago, about they found a Rothschild castle in France with all these dead women and women still alive in cages, and then it all disappeared out of the news.
[01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:29.655]  This is the hunger, folks.
[01:07:30.175 --> 01:07:31.536]  This is the occultism.
[01:07:31.976 --> 01:07:35.399]  And this is an international spy ring, but how are they going to try to cover it up?
[01:07:35.499 --> 01:07:36.340]  I'm not going to name names.
[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:46.627]  Barnes can go as far as he wants, but these women that are victims and are in these documents and proving the Clintons and all of this were there, how far is it going to go?
[01:07:46.947 --> 01:07:47.748]  How big is it?
[01:07:48.148 --> 01:07:50.690]  And historically, Robert Barnes, as I hand you an O on the baton,
[01:07:51.873 --> 01:07:52.494]  Gut level.
[01:07:52.934 --> 01:07:57.818]  How would you characterize this moment in the world when the whole case is falling apart?
[01:07:57.838 --> 01:08:00.320]  They're hiring the famous JFK coroners.
[01:08:00.361 --> 01:08:02.182]  They're turning the cameras off.
[01:08:02.242 --> 01:08:05.285]  The jail guards aren't supposed to even do their normal job every 30 minutes.
[01:08:06.566 --> 01:08:09.528]  I think they probably killed him because dead men tell no tales and it's a message to others.
[01:08:09.568 --> 01:08:10.469]  But who knows?
[01:08:10.790 --> 01:08:13.192]  All we know is questioning is the American way.
[01:08:13.712 --> 01:08:14.693]  I'm being sued, as you know.
[01:08:14.733 --> 01:08:16.554]  You represent me for questioning events.
[01:08:17.155 --> 01:08:18.136]  Robert Barnes, take over.
[01:08:18.176 --> 01:08:19.357]  We're all eagerly listening.
[01:08:21.007 --> 01:08:22.028]  I mean, it's extraordinary.
[01:08:22.048 --> 01:08:30.913]  I mean, the way I see it currently is that what you see with the Epstein death is almost the equivalent to what happened with Lee Harvey Oswald getting shot by Jack Ruby.
[01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:36.776]  That at the moment that happened for the world to see, the world awoke to a different reality.
[01:08:36.876 --> 01:08:39.538]  They started to understand that things were not as they had.
[01:08:40.238 --> 01:08:45.681]  The 1950s Civics book version of America wasn't the actual America they believed it was.
[01:08:45.781 --> 01:08:47.282]  There was something clearly AWOL.
[01:08:47.322 --> 01:08:48.503]  There was something clearly amiss.
[01:08:49.063 --> 01:08:51.065]  And that is definitely the case here.
[01:08:51.565 --> 01:08:54.668]  For example, I do a lot of cases involving people that are in federal detention.
[01:08:55.109 --> 01:09:00.473]  I also do a lot of civil rights cases involving people who are mistreated in various state and federal facilities.
[01:09:00.874 --> 01:09:03.776]  So I have intricate knowledge of how these facilities operate.
[01:09:04.297 --> 01:09:13.725]  In the Bureau of Prisons, ever since the early 2000s, when they imposed a wide range of protective procedures and protocols, it is near impossible to commit suicide.
[01:09:14.766 --> 01:09:15.966]  It is very, very difficult.
[01:09:16.267 --> 01:09:17.888]  And it's very difficult for multiple reasons.
[01:09:18.028 --> 01:09:24.232]  First, they design and structure the physical cell to not have the physical means for a person to commit suicide.
[01:09:24.632 --> 01:09:36.360]  As the New York Post published yesterday, recent inmates in the exact same cell that Epstein was in said they can't conceive of how he could have possibly done it, how he could have possibly committed suicide himself.
[01:09:36.781 --> 01:09:37.741]  So that's step one.
[01:09:38.102 --> 01:09:39.923]  So even if you somehow get past that,
[01:09:41.752 --> 01:09:45.775]  By the way, I would note that nobody has put out exactly how it is he died.
[01:09:45.995 --> 01:09:47.836]  They just said apparent suicide.
[01:09:48.177 --> 01:09:49.738]  They didn't say they found him hanging.
[01:09:50.118 --> 01:09:55.222]  And the reason a lot of people have doubts about that is there didn't appear to be any means to hang yourself inside that cell.
[01:09:55.562 --> 01:09:57.003]  They were saying, oh, he could have used his sheets.
[01:09:57.324 --> 01:09:58.264]  The sheets are paper.
[01:09:58.645 --> 01:10:05.290]  They deliberately structure every physical thing in that cell to make it almost impossible to commit suicide.
[01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:10.554]  In fact, nobody can remember the last time a suicide happened at MCC in Manhattan.
[01:10:10.914 --> 01:10:14.157]  The estimate is that the last time it happened was 44 years ago.
[01:10:14.657 --> 01:10:26.447]  To give you an idea, the Bureau of Prisons has a lower suicide rate, despite having a much higher risk profile of an inmate for mental health issues and suicidal risk, than does the population as a whole.
[01:10:26.928 --> 01:10:29.670]  That's how low the suicide risk is, and the reason for that
[01:10:30.177 --> 01:10:36.540]  In first part, the primary reason is the cells themselves are structured so it's very difficult to commit suicide.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.302]  But the second is all the observation that takes place.
[01:10:39.702 --> 01:10:44.684]  First you have your observation by the other person who's a fellow inmate in the jail cell with you.
[01:10:45.185 --> 01:10:50.867]  The next is that you have observation by video observation on your cell with a camera on it 24-7.
[01:10:52.248 --> 01:11:00.355]  The next level of observation is that the guards are either making 15-minute or 30-minute walk-bys, and usually they're doing it randomly so you don't know.
[01:11:00.415 --> 01:11:03.718]  It'll be at least every 30 minutes, but usually it's more often than not.
[01:11:03.778 --> 01:11:06.340]  And then if you're on suicide watch, it's 15 minutes.
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:12.125]  The clothing that you wear is made difficult for you to try to utilize it for any self-harm purposes.
[01:11:12.725 --> 01:11:17.389]  So, on top of that, for anybody who has shown any degree of suicidal ideation,
[01:11:17.853 --> 01:11:30.901]  And Rod Rosenstein effectively admitted yesterday, or two days ago, in his tweet, that all federal prosecutors and wardens know that someone that is charged, that Epstein is charged with, is inherently
[01:11:31.283 --> 01:11:33.405]  and necessarily a suicide risk.
[01:11:33.865 --> 01:11:56.021]  That means they have to be put on suicide watch before they can be removed from suicide watch, which in suicide watch involves making sure that their clothes are in such a way that there's no chance of any kind of self-harm, monitoring them pretty much 24-7 all the time with both cameras and a human person constantly looking at them all the way through, at least every 15 minutes, but usually more frequently, more often.
[01:11:56.561 --> 01:12:00.804]  And it involves therapeutic care by a psychologist, a trained psychologist,
[01:12:01.264 --> 01:12:13.106]  And on top of that, before a person can be removed from Suicide Watch, they have to have, the warden has to sign off, the chief shrink has to sign off, and chief supervisors and guards have to sign off.
[01:12:13.746 --> 01:12:22.748]  Here, what is already being admitted today and published in various reports today, is that his, first of all, someone was removed from his cell so that he was completely alone.
[01:12:23.188 --> 01:12:25.628]  That's a high risk for a suicidal person to be alone.
[01:12:27.109 --> 01:12:29.709]  Just hours before he is found dead.
[01:12:30.333 --> 01:12:37.677]  So that's for the one question will be, do we have videotape of him alive after that person was removed from itself?
[01:12:38.298 --> 01:12:41.280]  Because the question would be whether or not maybe he was already dead.
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:43.681]  And they just simply didn't realize he was dead.
[01:12:43.741 --> 01:12:45.142]  And he'd been killed by his inmate.
[01:12:46.838 --> 01:12:50.119]  We don't know, but that would be information we would want to know right away.
[01:12:50.159 --> 01:12:53.760]  Having dealt with these cases in other contexts would be evidence I would want to look at.
[01:12:54.121 --> 01:12:57.762]  I would want to look at the camera video footage for whatever it shows.
[01:12:58.502 --> 01:12:59.303]  Who went in and out?
[01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:00.483]  Who walked by?
[01:13:00.703 --> 01:13:01.304]  Who looked at it?
[01:13:01.404 --> 01:13:02.104]  Who examined it?
[01:13:02.344 --> 01:13:04.225]  When was the last time you were seen alive?
[01:13:04.845 --> 01:13:07.928]  So the probabilities of these aggregate set of errors.
[01:13:08.429 --> 01:13:17.638]  So I was debating various people like Scott Adams and other people yesterday on social media who were pointing out, you know, why attribute to intentionality what incompetence could explain.
[01:13:18.339 --> 01:13:23.224]  The reason here is because incompetence almost never produces this outcome in the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
[01:13:23.664 --> 01:13:26.547]  You're going to see a lot of data and information from the press and the left.
[01:13:27.079 --> 01:13:29.641]  That would be talking about the high rate of suicides in jails.
[01:13:30.001 --> 01:13:33.685]  They're gonna be talking about state jails, city jails, county jails.
[01:13:34.065 --> 01:13:37.648]  I know this because I bring those cases on a routine and regular basis.
[01:13:38.068 --> 01:13:44.734]  I probably brought more inmate suicide, death, self-harm related cases than all but a very few set of lawyers in the entire nation.
[01:13:45.294 --> 01:13:51.139]  And if you look at those cases, what those cases are going to reveal is that the federal system does not have this problem.
[01:13:51.599 --> 01:13:56.603]  And it does not have this problem because they use so many procedures and protocols.
[01:13:56.623 --> 01:14:06.051]  You have to have a collective, systemic, aggregate error by a wide range, cross number of people at the same time, in the same place, as to the same person.
[01:14:06.511 --> 01:14:16.275]  What's the probabilities that the shrink messed up, and the warden messed up, and the supervisors messed up, and the guards messed up, and the cameras messed up, all accidentally?
[01:14:16.735 --> 01:14:25.179]  With the, just from a sort of, the sort of Occam's razor, if you just use that standard or methodology, what is the most likely explanation?
[01:14:25.599 --> 01:14:33.162]  If we decontextualize it, and we put this in Russia, or we put this in other countries, or we put this in a different time, or we remove the name of Epstein or Clinton,
[01:14:33.762 --> 01:14:37.643]  Our natural conclusion would be to say that foul play clearly occurred here.
[01:14:38.384 --> 01:14:51.728]  And it came out, this happened on the same day, that he gets all those records disclosed by the case brought by Mike Cernovich and attorney Randazzo in New York, which was a motion to intervene, which was to unseal a bunch of records.
[01:14:52.288 --> 01:15:00.011]  And what was interesting about that was the lawyer for the victim, who had brought the suit against Jose Maxwell,
[01:15:00.743 --> 01:15:08.069]  And so the suit didn't involve Epstein directly, it just involved him indirectly by all the evidence that the victim had concerning Mr. Epstein.
[01:15:08.569 --> 01:15:13.573]  So Epstein, you could say, was the real party in interest, even if he was not the legal party in interest.
[01:15:14.694 --> 01:15:18.136]  And what the record showed is a lot of extraordinary information.
[01:15:18.156 --> 01:15:19.197]  It exonerated Trump.
[01:15:19.833 --> 01:15:22.416]  What the victim said was that she'd never seen Trump there.
[01:15:22.436 --> 01:15:26.080]  She'd never seen him even flirt with other women, least of all be involved with anyone.
[01:15:26.581 --> 01:15:34.129]  By contrast, the information incriminated and implicated Al Gore, Bill Clinton, Senator George Mitchell, which was
[01:15:34.701 --> 01:15:37.863]  Complete shock to me, because that was the first time his name had come up.
[01:15:37.983 --> 01:15:43.425]  Prince Andrew, some of the most powerful, privileged people in the world, hedge fund, Wall Streeters, other people.
[01:15:43.806 --> 01:15:48.348]  So when we come back on the other side, we'll talk about what's really happening in that case.
[01:15:48.748 --> 01:15:50.449]  What did that disclosure mean?
[01:15:50.869 --> 01:15:54.311]  What does it mean for whether there's going to be a meaningful investigation into Epstein?
[01:15:54.451 --> 01:15:56.612]  Whether there's going to be follow-up criminal cases?
[01:15:56.992 --> 01:16:02.155]  What does the mysterious suicide, the Harvey Oswald style of Epstein, mean going forward?
[01:16:04.889 --> 01:16:07.011]  Without your support, we won't be here.
[01:16:07.311 --> 01:16:10.773]  And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game.
[01:16:10.793 --> 01:16:12.174]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[01:16:12.314 --> 01:16:13.535]  I want to take the globalist on.
[01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:15.497]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[01:16:15.557 --> 01:16:20.620]  If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products, because we don't mark stuff up that much.
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:24.583]  And then there's all the employees and fees and fines and paying all our own stuff and legal.
[01:16:24.743 --> 01:16:26.484]  I don't care if I'm not making money.
[01:16:26.504 --> 01:16:29.847]  But if I'm not making money, it means I'm close to death.
[01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:30.868]  This world
[01:16:31.608 --> 01:16:33.070]  Didn't keep very many nuts behind.
[01:16:33.391 --> 01:16:35.093]  But used to, I kept five or six nuts.
[01:16:35.414 --> 01:16:36.715]  Most girls would keep a hundred nuts.
[01:16:37.136 --> 01:16:40.601]  But I had five or six nuts, because I wanted to put every bit of energy into this.
[01:16:41.022 --> 01:16:42.564]  Folks, I don't have any more nuts left.
[01:16:42.944 --> 01:16:43.886]  Except one stream of legs.
[01:16:45.633 --> 01:16:50.236]  It's just, I can't tell you how great it is what you've done, but you need to buy the products.
[01:16:50.316 --> 01:16:58.562]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus, but Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[01:16:58.762 --> 01:17:01.264]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:04.186]  We have fish oil, children's fish oil, and Ultimate Krill Oil.
[01:17:04.206 --> 01:17:10.730]  It's totally full of the bottle, and it is the strongest, purest fish oil, Krill Oil, and it cost us three times more
[01:17:10.930 --> 01:17:11.530]  We're good to go.
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:38.285]  Private Labels fish oil and krill oil and we said we want the best you make period and they're like well this is medical stuff that's sold in medical clinics for $100 a bottle.
[01:17:38.346 --> 01:17:40.107]  I want to show people this krill oil.
[01:17:40.267 --> 01:17:44.570]  This ladies and gentlemen is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:17:44.691 --> 01:17:46.232]  This is thermonuclear right here.
[01:17:46.532 --> 01:17:47.153]  It's red.
[01:17:47.273 --> 01:17:47.513]  This is
[01:17:48.153 --> 01:17:49.754]  Real krill oil, folks, is red.
[01:17:49.774 --> 01:17:50.435]  It's not yellow.
[01:17:50.855 --> 01:17:51.575]  It's not milky.
[01:17:51.595 --> 01:17:53.316]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[01:17:53.456 --> 01:17:54.997]  And, by the way, I'm not hyping this, folks.
[01:17:55.217 --> 01:17:57.959]  This is the best krill oil we could find.
[01:17:58.019 --> 01:17:59.180]  This is the best.
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:00.561]  I can't even just look at that.
[01:18:00.661 --> 01:18:03.502]  It's supposed to be red, folks, because that's the essence of the krill.
[01:18:03.522 --> 01:18:06.184]  I mean, there's probably like a hundred krill going into each one of these.
[01:18:06.404 --> 01:18:09.886]  And, again, I'm not going to call this a drug, because drugs are a ripoff of what God made.
[01:18:10.126 --> 01:18:12.628]  You take two of these before you go to bed at night.
[01:18:12.788 --> 01:18:14.809]  I would do it with your dinner if you don't want to get fish burps.
[01:18:14.829 --> 01:18:15.950]  Because, again, they've got the fish oil.
[01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:19.532]  This doesn't have the fish flavor because they boiled the hell out of it.
[01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:20.753]  It isn't there anymore, folks.
[01:18:20.833 --> 01:18:22.093]  You got to deal with the fish burps.
[01:18:22.394 --> 01:18:23.194]  This stuff's powerful.
[01:18:23.214 --> 01:18:23.895]  Just look at that.
[01:18:24.055 --> 01:18:26.196]  Can the camera pick up just how pretty those are?
[01:18:26.356 --> 01:18:31.619]  And we've got store-wide free shipping, double pay-it-free at points, 50 to 60% off all the supplements, storable foods, all of it.
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:38.084]  It's got to end by Sunday or Monday because a bunch of stuff is selling out like the Alexa Pure, Pros, and many other things.
[01:18:38.104 --> 01:18:41.226]  So take action now and energize our weapon systems.
[01:19:07.150 --> 01:19:14.656]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[01:19:15.156 --> 01:19:28.247]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[01:19:29.748 --> 01:19:33.190]  Trans-dimensionally, over the space-time continuance, or full space-time.
[01:19:33.511 --> 01:19:37.633]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[01:19:37.833 --> 01:19:39.955]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[01:19:42.642 --> 01:19:58.756]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling!
[01:19:58.956 --> 01:19:59.677]  InfoWars.
[01:20:00.057 --> 01:20:01.678]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[01:20:06.402 --> 01:20:09.005]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:35.151 --> 01:20:41.236]  Blasting through the third and fourth dimension, it's the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:44.539 --> 01:20:47.922]  Owen Troyer filling in for Alex Jones, Robert Barnes on the line with me.
[01:20:47.962 --> 01:20:54.248]  We're going to get right back into some of this Epstein news with Bob and some of these other headlines and developments we have.
[01:20:55.369 --> 01:21:02.135]  But first, ladies and gentlemen, you know, we are the, we are the Space Odyssey.
[01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:15.275]  We are the Millennium Falcon, and they want us shut down because we covered the Epstein stuff years ago.
[01:21:16.336 --> 01:21:19.359]  It's almost like so old hat to us, the Epstein stuff.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:29.228]  It's just a review almost, but there's other stories that we cover that they don't cover anywhere else either, and that's why they want us banned.
[01:21:30.967 --> 01:21:54.274]  But thanks to the audience going to InfoWarsStore.com, buying the toothpaste, buying the toothbrushes, buying the shampoo, buying the body wash, buying the air filters and water filters and all the great supplements that are still on sale for one more day, and your thoughts and prayers, we survive and maintain in this battle.
[01:21:54.814 --> 01:21:58.455]  But now you see why InfoWars is the most banned news network out there, folks.
[01:22:00.645 --> 01:22:03.007]  And, you know, here's the challenge.
[01:22:04.527 --> 01:22:08.110]  How do you get people to understand how real this all is?
[01:22:09.730 --> 01:22:17.175]  How do you get people to really sink their teeth and their mind and their soul and their spirit and their consciousness into this to realize how real it is?
[01:22:18.516 --> 01:22:25.440]  Because, you know, you have all these Christians that read the Bible and live good lives, but they're missing the fight.
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:26.560]  They're missing the battle.
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:27.761]  They don't even realize that
[01:22:29.028 --> 01:22:30.409]  This is the fight of good and evil.
[01:22:30.449 --> 01:22:32.370]  This is the spiritual battle that we're in right now.
[01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:45.836]  And so we just come here every day, put it all on the line in this spiritual battle, and it's thanks to you going to InfoWarsStore.com, we can survive, despite all the censorship that you've seen against us.
[01:22:46.876 --> 01:22:55.360]  So again, one day left for the Banniversary sales at InfoWarsStore.com, which include up to 60% off all of our top supplements,
[01:22:56.988 --> 01:23:05.613]  We've got free shipping storewide, huge discounts on air filters and water filters, double patriot points with every order that can be used towards future purchases.
[01:23:06.593 --> 01:23:07.814]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:23:08.594 --> 01:23:17.279]  And then tell your friends and family about InfoWars.com slash show so that they can watch the banned broadcast and see why they really ban us.
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:22.062]  Okay, we're going to get back on with
[01:23:23.035 --> 01:23:29.679]  Bob Barnes here shortly, and then Patrick Howley is going to be joining us to, again, sink our teeth into all of this Epstein news.
[01:23:29.819 --> 01:23:33.862]  But, you know, I've got so much to get to.
[01:23:35.083 --> 01:23:36.103]  Let me just do this, though.
[01:23:36.403 --> 01:23:44.228]  I'm going to go down this headline of Epstein, these headlines of Epstein news, and let's see if we can't read the tea leaves of what's coming next.
[01:23:47.478 --> 01:23:52.522]  Attorney General Bob Barr says he has serious questions about the Epstein death.
[01:23:53.003 --> 01:23:53.883]  Well, okay.
[01:23:54.424 --> 01:23:55.365]  Serious questions.
[01:23:56.566 --> 01:23:59.208]  I try to figure out, what does that really mean?
[01:24:00.189 --> 01:24:02.971]  Well, if he's got serious questions, you'd think he'd be asking them, but he's not.
[01:24:04.212 --> 01:24:05.793]  So does he really have serious questions?
[01:24:06.694 --> 01:24:10.377]  This isn't an insult to Barnes, it's just, or excuse me, to Barr.
[01:24:10.397 --> 01:24:12.519]  It's just maybe he already knows what happened.
[01:24:13.223 --> 01:24:13.964]  Maybe he was part of it.
[01:24:14.504 --> 01:24:15.825]  Again, that doesn't mean bad or good.
[01:24:16.326 --> 01:24:17.327]  Like, FC might be out.
[01:24:17.627 --> 01:24:20.269]  Folks, they could have easily just gotten him out of jail, put him in witness protection.
[01:24:20.289 --> 01:24:22.451]  I mean, you see the conspiracy theories.
[01:24:22.531 --> 01:24:23.192]  Oh, that's not FC.
[01:24:23.212 --> 01:24:23.872]  Well, maybe it's not.
[01:24:23.932 --> 01:24:24.272]  I don't know.
[01:24:24.993 --> 01:24:26.234]  I know he didn't get suicided.
[01:24:26.254 --> 01:24:28.476]  Or I know he didn't commit suicide.
[01:24:28.536 --> 01:24:30.718]  So, so does Attorney General Bob Barr.
[01:24:31.218 --> 01:24:32.459]  He's got serious questions, he says.
[01:24:32.479 --> 01:24:32.800]  We'll see.
[01:24:34.278 --> 01:24:35.679]  Uh, they didn't check on him for hours.
[01:24:35.719 --> 01:24:37.700]  Apparently they ended the suicide watch.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:46.784]  Even the Daily Beast, and it's all to try to connect it to Trump, but even the Daily Beast has the biggest bombshells from the Jeffrey Epstein documents.
[01:24:47.565 --> 01:24:52.947]  Directed to have sex, uh, his, uh, his sex slaves with the world's most powerful men.
[01:24:53.808 --> 01:24:55.769]  Epstein needed three orgasms a day.
[01:24:56.329 --> 01:24:58.910]  Used over a hundred girls and sex toys.
[01:25:00.351 --> 01:25:02.212]  Uh, it's just, it's all in here.
[01:25:04.465 --> 01:25:06.526]  Swedish girl says she was held hostage at the age of 15.
[01:25:06.846 --> 01:25:10.888]  Yeah, and then they always try to tie it back into Trump.
[01:25:11.128 --> 01:25:15.270]  That's the whole point of the Daily Beast even doing this is try to tie it back into Trump.
[01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:20.692]  But it's all about sex slaves and what Epstein was doing on his island.
[01:25:22.433 --> 01:25:26.535]  The computers and hard drives were removed before the police raid.
[01:25:30.178 --> 01:25:35.239]  But again, they try to connect it to Trump, and so now people are saying, oh, they're actually questioning the death because they think it has something to do with Trump.
[01:25:36.179 --> 01:25:40.700]  Seven unanswered questions about Epstein's death that the mainstream media is not talking about from Michael Snyder.
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:43.161]  Why are the autopsy results being delayed?
[01:25:43.381 --> 01:25:45.501]  What will any cameras show?
[01:25:45.541 --> 01:25:46.701]  If we'll ever see it, we won't.
[01:25:47.422 --> 01:25:49.162]  Why was Epstein off suicide watch?
[01:25:49.362 --> 01:25:51.142]  Why did guards break the rules?
[01:25:52.943 --> 01:25:54.723]  Why would Epstein try to kill himself?
[01:25:56.934 --> 01:25:59.858]  Why would Epstein tell the guards someone was trying to kill him?
[01:26:00.519 --> 01:26:01.560]  Yeah, folks, the defense came out.
[01:26:02.061 --> 01:26:03.142]  They said Epstein was going to die.
[01:26:03.242 --> 01:26:04.324]  You can go back and read the stories.
[01:26:04.544 --> 01:26:05.685]  They said someone was trying to kill Epstein.
[01:26:05.705 --> 01:26:06.106]  They all knew.
[01:26:06.987 --> 01:26:08.229]  How would Epstein kill himself?
[01:26:09.568 --> 01:26:10.629]  Mainstream media won't answer.
[01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:14.893]  Wealth of Jeffrey Epstein's brother, also a mystery.
[01:26:15.654 --> 01:26:17.076]  That story in Wall Street Journal.
[01:26:18.016 --> 01:26:20.038]  Yeah, is it really so much of a mystery?
[01:26:20.199 --> 01:26:24.483]  What happens to Jeffrey Epstein's money and homes now?
[01:26:24.623 --> 01:26:27.246]  Can Feds seize everything?
[01:26:27.306 --> 01:26:29.128]  So let's get Bob Barnes back on.
[01:26:29.168 --> 01:26:33.172]  So we know the names, a lot of the names, probably not all of the names, we know a lot
[01:26:33.712 --> 01:26:38.356]  Of the circumstances, people are finally realizing that this guy was part of a huge criminal network.
[01:26:38.756 --> 01:26:40.718]  I guess his brother was even making money off of it.
[01:26:42.259 --> 01:26:55.850]  So what do you think comes next as this, in the legal terms, everything, the focus switches over to Maxwell, and I'm hearing that she's going to cooperate, and I think that's because she's afraid that she might commit suicide soon.
[01:26:56.571 --> 01:26:58.673]  But where do you think all of this goes next, Bob Barnes?
[01:26:59.636 --> 01:27:01.697]  Well, you know, Maxwell has a very unusual history.
[01:27:01.757 --> 01:27:10.621]  So her father was Robert Maxwell, who mysteriously died under unusual circumstances himself many years ago.
[01:27:10.641 --> 01:27:16.503]  There was allegations of intelligence agency ties, bank fraud allegations, financial fraud allegations.
[01:27:16.863 --> 01:27:21.365]  Goes out onto his yacht, everything seemed to be cool and kosher, and then they just find him dead.
[01:27:21.965 --> 01:27:23.546]  They claimed it was suicide by drowning.
[01:27:23.826 --> 01:27:25.728]  That's a very unusual way to commit suicide.
[01:27:26.129 --> 01:27:29.713]  So if you're her, your father died under unusual circumstances.
[01:27:30.433 --> 01:27:38.182]  Now, the person you are the most connected to, Mr. Epstein, dies under unusual circumstances while in federal custody, the safest place you're supposed to be.
[01:27:38.923 --> 01:27:42.627]  There's rumors and talk that nobody actually knows exactly where she is right now.
[01:27:43.223 --> 01:27:48.568]  So the, I mean, whether she's even around, whether she's disappeared, whether she can be found.
[01:27:48.988 --> 01:27:52.211]  So I think that the Attorney General Barr is serious.
[01:27:52.291 --> 01:27:59.538]  And today he said he acknowledged there were serious irregularities with what took place, serious problems with what took place at NCC.
[01:27:59.918 --> 01:28:06.324]  He also said that all the co-conspirators should not be thinking that this ends the case, that they are going to try to pursue it.
[01:28:06.745 --> 01:28:08.066]  I think as a practical matter,
[01:28:08.730 --> 01:28:26.654]  When the Justice Department and the Feds and the Southern District of New York chose not to raid his properties in New Mexico, in the Virgin Islands, in Florida, that meant they were not going to be able to gather the kind of evidence that they should, and it provided an opportunity for other people, as InfoWars has reported.
[01:28:27.235 --> 01:28:31.356]  There's unusual activity at the Virgin Islands home of Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:28:31.476 --> 01:28:33.136]  There's unexplained activity.
[01:28:33.716 --> 01:28:38.622]  Yeah, they took down the dome, there was a bunch of construction, underground construction.
[01:28:40.554 --> 01:28:44.076]  They were exhuming things, and I don't want to get too conspiratorial.
[01:28:45.256 --> 01:28:49.038]  Bob, if you can stay another segment, maybe we'll have you on with a segment with Patrick Howley.
[01:28:49.078 --> 01:28:50.259]  We had a bad Skype connection.
[01:28:50.279 --> 01:28:57.722]  We had to get reconnected, but I kind of want to, again, because I don't... Attorney General Barr says, oh, he's got serious questions.
[01:28:57.822 --> 01:29:02.504]  Well, I mean, I want to get into that, because he knows what's going on, or he wants to, he can ask.
[01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:22.851]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:29:23.512 --> 01:29:29.738]  Seriously, I don't want to say we're treading water because I've found ways to cut things and do certain things.
[01:29:31.218 --> 01:29:36.242]  Do this and that and still fund our operation, but man, if we had more money, we could sure hurt the globalists a lot worse.
[01:29:36.402 --> 01:29:38.904]  Plus, our supplements are the very best.
[01:29:39.004 --> 01:29:42.246]  Our water filtration, our air filtration, it's all really excellent.
[01:29:42.566 --> 01:29:50.152]  The non-GMO heirloom seeds, the shortwave radios, the t-shirts, the books, the films, the Betsy Ross flag shirts, all of it is at InfoWarsTour.com and
[01:29:51.308 --> 01:30:01.512]  We're extending last week's big sale, because they reminded me, they said, hey, the 6th yesterday is the anniversary of you getting banned to set the precedent for the global Chinese social credit score.
[01:30:01.612 --> 01:30:02.432]  Gotta make that point.
[01:30:02.452 --> 01:30:03.973]  Here we are, a year later, still fighting.
[01:30:03.993 --> 01:30:04.753]  Thanks for your support.
[01:30:04.833 --> 01:30:06.614]  Let me tell you, these are products you need.
[01:30:06.674 --> 01:30:08.955]  So get your Real Red Pill Plus 60% off.
[01:30:08.975 --> 01:30:09.615]  We've never done that.
[01:30:09.735 --> 01:30:14.056]  Even though it's a great seller, I want you to experience how amazing the stuff is.
[01:30:14.096 --> 01:30:19.217]  And I'm not going to get into everything that's in it, but a real Red Pill Plus, Survival Shield X2, DNA Force Plus back in stock.
[01:30:19.257 --> 01:30:20.177]  It's massively discounted.
[01:30:20.297 --> 01:30:22.198]  Ultra 12, Turbo Force is amazing.
[01:30:22.398 --> 01:30:23.398]  Protein bars are back.
[01:30:23.458 --> 01:30:24.318]  The coffee's great.
[01:30:24.398 --> 01:30:26.539]  Just find out about each and every one of them for yourself.
[01:30:26.759 --> 01:30:31.420]  I had an earache this weekend because I didn't wash my ears out after I swam in the lake.
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:32.420]  And it's the hot part of the summer.
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:36.121]  And I just went and found some cologne because I didn't have any alcohol.
[01:30:36.161 --> 01:30:37.061]  Poured it in my ear.
[01:30:37.301 --> 01:30:38.682]  It only partially killed the bacteria.
[01:30:38.882 --> 01:30:40.124]  I got home the next day.
[01:30:40.144 --> 01:30:41.105]  I was out at the lake.
[01:30:41.265 --> 01:30:43.767]  And I found coiled silver from Infowarshore.com.
[01:30:43.867 --> 01:30:44.968]  Little quarter bottle we had left.
[01:30:45.028 --> 01:30:45.809]  Dumped it in my ear.
[01:30:45.909 --> 01:30:48.711]  Within 10 minutes, the bacteria wore dead.
[01:30:48.772 --> 01:30:49.913]  The pain was gone.
[01:30:50.393 --> 01:30:51.414]  And I'm not a tough guy.
[01:30:51.434 --> 01:30:52.575]  I can handle a little pain.
[01:30:52.635 --> 01:30:53.576]  Well, maybe I'm a little tough.
[01:30:53.596 --> 01:30:55.818]  But the point is, is that I was taking Advil.
[01:30:55.958 --> 01:30:57.079]  It was hurting so bad that night.
[01:30:57.319 --> 01:30:59.942]  And I mean, 10 minutes, just bye-bye, dead.
[01:31:02.136 --> 01:31:02.737]  That's right.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:10.840]  Double X's, baby.
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.041]  Dead as a doornail.
[01:31:13.001 --> 01:31:16.642]  And Fullershore.com has what is rated the safest 30 parts per million.
[01:31:16.722 --> 01:31:17.802]  You can get it even stronger.
[01:31:18.042 --> 01:31:19.143]  I don't recommend you take that.
[01:31:19.223 --> 01:31:21.023]  It kills bacteria and viruses for erasers.
[01:31:21.063 --> 01:31:27.425]  So we sell what is studied, most recommended to be that good media between 30 parts per million from the top lab in the country.
[01:31:27.505 --> 01:31:28.946]  Like super silver wound gel.
[01:31:29.126 --> 01:31:31.327]  That is the strongest over-the-counter silver you can get.
[01:31:31.527 --> 01:31:35.288]  Do not ingest that if you value your kidneys and your liver.
[01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:38.669]  But let me tell you, it works like
[01:31:40.027 --> 01:31:40.770]  A ton of bricks.
[01:31:41.695 --> 01:31:43.946]  On topical stuff, it's strong.
[01:32:03.291 --> 01:32:16.242]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[01:32:16.482 --> 01:32:19.025]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[01:32:19.405 --> 01:32:20.506]  farming goods a week ago.
[01:32:21.166 --> 01:32:24.810]  And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president.
[01:32:25.450 --> 01:32:29.373]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[01:32:29.993 --> 01:32:30.554]  That's beautiful.
[01:32:31.034 --> 01:32:32.595]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[01:32:32.936 --> 01:32:33.936]  And we aren't going to back down.
[01:32:34.537 --> 01:32:41.902]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[01:32:42.142 --> 01:32:44.104]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[01:32:44.464 --> 01:32:48.327]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:32:48.607 --> 01:32:49.568]  And I'm asking listeners,
[01:32:50.356 --> 01:32:54.140]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:55.321]  We are the resistance.
[01:32:55.562 --> 01:32:57.944]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[01:33:05.853 --> 01:33:08.476]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.366 --> 01:33:25.767]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:26.047 --> 01:33:27.228]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:27.748 --> 01:33:29.149]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.709 --> 01:33:32.771]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:37.234 --> 01:33:41.816]  We've got Robert Barnes and we've got Patrick Howley on the air with us right now.
[01:33:41.856 --> 01:33:44.038]  We're discussing Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:33:44.058 --> 01:33:47.660]  Let me put this question out there to both of you and get both of your takes on this.
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:52.623]  Attorney General Bob Barr says he has serious questions about Epstein's death.
[01:33:53.283 --> 01:33:59.347]  Well, it's been, I don't know the exact hours, let's say at least 50, since Epstein's death.
[01:33:59.527 --> 01:34:09.514]  Any questions that Barr had, he could have already had answered by now, and he knows, or he already knew the answers before he claimed to have the questions.
[01:34:10.115 --> 01:34:12.957]  Let's go first to Robert Barnes and then Patrick Halley on this.
[01:34:13.637 --> 01:34:17.220]  What do you take away from Attorney General Barr saying he has serious questions?
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.601]  So, is he really
[01:34:19.361 --> 01:34:26.804]  Insinuating that this went on right under his nose and and something happened or and he's really has questions and then did he ask them?
[01:34:26.864 --> 01:34:31.946]  Why isn't he made a public or does he already know the answers and he's just going along for the ride?
[01:34:33.186 --> 01:34:35.247]  I suspect he does not know the full answers.
[01:34:35.287 --> 01:34:43.910]  And the reason for that is there's a range of administrative procedures and protocols involved, including the BOP corrections officers are represented by unions.
[01:34:44.654 --> 01:34:48.316]  And so you're going to have a natural CYA effort taking place here.
[01:34:48.716 --> 01:34:52.038]  So the probabilities they're giving clear communication to him is low.
[01:34:52.518 --> 01:35:01.483]  They're probably saying we're investigating, we're trying to figure out, there are some things that we found that happened that weren't supposed to happen, but we don't know the whole story yet and we're reviewing it.
[01:35:01.964 --> 01:35:11.749]  And because of the evidentiary methodologies that have to be required under the Union Contract and Internal Federal Administrative Procedures Act, that creates a situation whereby they can stall him.
[01:35:12.089 --> 01:35:13.370]  They can't stall him interminably.
[01:35:14.315 --> 01:35:16.440]  It can stall him for at least several days.
[01:35:16.821 --> 01:35:20.691]  So I think what he's saying is he's recognizing something happened here that wasn't supposed to.
[01:35:20.891 --> 01:35:21.593]  Now give him credit.
[01:35:21.633 --> 01:35:23.839]  When's the last time you saw something like this happen?
[01:35:24.608 --> 01:35:24.968]  I don't know.
[01:35:48.556 --> 01:35:58.525]  They, and Barr being involved, snuck him out of prison so that they could put him under witness protection and he could continue to give whatever cooperation he was giving.
[01:35:59.006 --> 01:36:00.988]  Or two, he was killed.
[01:36:01.048 --> 01:36:02.229]  Someone got in and killed him.
[01:36:02.749 --> 01:36:06.032]  Or three, somehow he was actually snuck out of jail.
[01:36:06.112 --> 01:36:08.575]  Somehow they actually broke him out of jail.
[01:36:08.735 --> 01:36:11.197]  So the final two scenarios, Barr would obviously have questions.
[01:36:11.217 --> 01:36:12.779]  The first one I think he would be involved in.
[01:36:12.819 --> 01:36:14.200]  Patrick Cowley, what do you think's going on?
[01:36:15.188 --> 01:36:20.231]  Well, Owen, my general belief is that Epstein is dead and they did kill him and that the Clintons were involved.
[01:36:20.571 --> 01:36:26.455]  Now, regardless of which scenario actually happened, the responsibility is on Attorney General Barr to keep this thing going.
[01:36:26.875 --> 01:36:31.778]  You can tell very easily what the play is for the deep state by reading NBC News.
[01:36:32.158 --> 01:36:35.440]  Immediately after Epstein's death,
[01:36:35.788 --> 01:36:42.954]  NBC News laid out the SIOP very clearly and said there will probably not be any more criminal investigations stemming from this.
[01:36:42.974 --> 01:36:44.615]  No case against Ghislaine Maxwell.
[01:36:44.936 --> 01:36:46.277]  But there will be civil suits.
[01:36:46.657 --> 01:36:49.820]  Now the civil suits are being managed by Lisa Bloom.
[01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:54.624]  Lisa Bloom, who is Gloria Allred's daughter, is actually handling the civil cases.
[01:36:55.024 --> 01:37:04.692]  And the reason they're allowed to sue is because Andrew Cuomo in February signed a law that, you know, gives them an extra year in order to file this case, even though the statute of limitations ran out.
[01:37:05.012 --> 01:37:13.018]  So the Democrat establishment is managing this and they want these lawsuits to happen because it gives Gloria Allred's daughter the opportunity.
[01:37:13.139 --> 01:37:14.179]  I'm actually glad you went there.
[01:37:14.199 --> 01:37:20.705]  I'm sorry to cut you off, but I actually want to focus on this because I saw this and now I'm starting to wonder because
[01:37:21.704 --> 01:37:28.728]  Gloria Alred, Lisa Bloom, while they definitely smell blood in the water and they're legal sharks, maybe they actually want to bring this fish in.
[01:37:29.608 --> 01:37:37.132]  Or are they maybe not, maybe they're not being fully honest with these victims and they're trying to keep the situation under control.
[01:37:37.172 --> 01:37:41.554]  I mean, I don't want to think the worst of Aldrin and Bloom, but I mean, we got to look at all the angles here.
[01:37:42.586 --> 01:37:43.107]  Oh, of course!
[01:37:43.527 --> 01:37:53.776]  Look, the government has seized a tremendous amount of Jeffrey Epstein's property, including stuff that was on that island, where we know there was a satanic temple, and a statue of Moloch the Owl next to the satanic temple.
[01:37:54.216 --> 01:37:58.781]  Now, that evidence needs to come out, and Attorney General Barr needs to bring it out.
[01:37:58.841 --> 01:38:01.323]  However, there are agents who are trying to suppress it.
[01:38:01.603 --> 01:38:05.867]  James Comey's daughter, Maureen Comey, was added by SDNY as a prosecutor on this case,
[01:38:06.167 --> 01:38:09.830]  To try to limit the investigation so all of this Clinton stuff wouldn't come out.
[01:38:10.190 --> 01:38:26.742]  But I encourage you to look at the Giselaine Maxwell civil case deposition from a few years ago which was unsealed one day before Epstein's death in which Virginia Roberts made it very clear that there was a party on Epstein's Island thrown for Bill Clinton after he left office.
[01:38:27.122 --> 01:38:30.865]  I believe that took place in 2002 and there were underage girls present.
[01:38:31.405 --> 01:38:36.348]  Well, and let's be clear, the whole thing with the Clinton body count is just that the Clintons have had all these people die mysteriously around them.
[01:38:37.349 --> 01:38:40.711]  It's well known, the crimes of Bill Clinton in Arkansas by the locals.
[01:38:41.171 --> 01:38:42.772]  You know, the mainstream news covers it up.
[01:38:43.652 --> 01:38:48.195]  But really, there's elites all over the world that want Epstein dead.
[01:38:48.215 --> 01:38:50.036]  I mean, we're talking about British royalty, too.
[01:38:50.316 --> 01:38:55.039]  So the whole Clinton connection is just, oh, the Clinton body count's already a trend, and oh, they're connected to the Clintons.
[01:38:55.059 --> 01:38:56.700]  But a lot of people had interest in Epstein being dead.
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:57.921]  But Bob Barnes, let me ask you.
[01:38:58.826 --> 01:39:05.209]  What do you make of Gloria Alred and Lisa Bloom being in charge of these civil suits right now?
[01:39:05.609 --> 01:39:13.933]  Do you think they have the victim's best interest in mind, or as usual, perhaps their own best interest in mind, or perhaps maybe a Democratic Party's interest in mind?
[01:39:15.133 --> 01:39:27.099]  Well, I think a good background on this is that the main victim's lawyer that was involved in the Maxwell case, who was opposing and objecting to the intervention and the unsealing of the records from Mike Cernovich,
[01:39:27.745 --> 01:39:29.726]  That lawyer is David Bowie's law firm.
[01:39:29.926 --> 01:39:39.129]  So people can Google David Bowie's, B-O-I-E-S, and draw their own conclusions about whether Bowie's is a conflicted attorney involved in the proceedings.
[01:39:39.629 --> 01:39:48.752]  Because here he kept arguing, his firm, kept arguing in federal court that the records should remain sealed because somehow they would damage the victim.
[01:39:49.173 --> 01:39:53.194]  But once the records were unsealed, almost none of the records damaged the victim.
[01:39:53.755 --> 01:40:04.039]  Instead, the records damage people like Al Gore, people like Senator George Mitchell, people like, who's the Senate Majority Leader for a long time, people like Prince Andrew.
[01:40:04.059 --> 01:40:17.304]  That's what I'm saying here, that's why I want your legal expertise on this, because again, I don't want to think the worst of these lawyer groups, and I don't want to, you know, become some sort of snare in the victim's mentality here, but I mean,
[01:40:18.124 --> 01:40:23.387]  You gotta wonder, I mean, Lisa Bloom, Gloria Alred, any other situation, they're on national TV doing interviews 24-7.
[01:40:23.467 --> 01:40:25.347]  I haven't seen them on TV once, Bob.
[01:40:25.367 --> 01:40:30.170]  Not only that, I think also, here's the other consequence of Epstein's death.
[01:40:30.710 --> 01:40:33.211]  It's not clear to me how any of those suits go forward now.
[01:40:33.851 --> 01:40:41.535]  Because when a person is dead, the legal system generally does not allow a suit against them to go forward because they're not in a position to defend themselves.
[01:40:42.055 --> 01:40:45.517]  So I guess technically they're going to be suing the estate of Jeff Epstein,
[01:40:46.049 --> 01:40:46.289]  I think so.
[01:41:03.735 --> 01:41:09.741]  Where really the lawyers involved are representing the interest of someone else other than their nominal client.
[01:41:10.282 --> 01:41:14.106]  And that's the concern here about David Bowie's firm.
[01:41:14.166 --> 01:41:15.147]  Was it he conflicted?
[01:41:15.227 --> 01:41:19.051]  David Bowie famously represented Al Gore in Bush v. Gore in 2000.
[01:41:20.132 --> 01:41:30.916]  When it came out that, in fact, his client had identified Al Gore as potentially a problematic individual connected to Epstein, doesn't that create a conflict of interest that precludes him from being involved?
[01:41:30.936 --> 01:41:32.137]  And you know it firsthand.
[01:41:32.177 --> 01:41:42.400]  I mean, we won't get too into details, but I mean, folks, you'll be high-profile lawyers to try to get in control of a case will offer services, you know, just to control a case.
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:46.042]  I mean, we don't need to get into too much detail, but I mean, we've seen it.
[01:41:47.102 --> 01:41:48.884]  Again, I'm not saying that's what's happening.
[01:41:49.284 --> 01:41:50.545]  We just have to ask these questions.
[01:41:51.566 --> 01:41:52.206]  Oh, no doubt about it.
[01:41:52.507 --> 01:41:53.848]  There's no doubt.
[01:41:54.588 --> 01:41:56.470]  I've compared David Bowie's to Robert Mueller.
[01:41:56.630 --> 01:42:02.195]  He is to the deep state outside the system, inside the legal system, what Robert Mueller was inside the government.
[01:42:02.695 --> 01:42:11.663]  And I've dealt with him in multiple contexts and multiple cases where his fingerprints were left on the case where he conveniently provided a scapegoat for institutional interest.
[01:42:12.644 --> 01:42:14.685]  Often against the nominal interest of his client.
[01:42:15.085 --> 01:42:16.786]  So the fact, it's just weird.
[01:42:16.807 --> 01:42:18.528]  David Bowies is not a personal injury lawyer.
[01:42:18.568 --> 01:42:20.009]  He's not a human trafficking lawyer.
[01:42:20.049 --> 01:42:21.530]  He's not a sexual harassment lawyer.
[01:42:21.930 --> 01:42:27.314]  How did he get control over key cases that implicated potential high-profile Democrats?
[01:42:27.694 --> 01:42:29.095]  Do you have any idea who David Bowies is?
[01:42:29.376 --> 01:42:32.498]  David Bowies was Harvey Weinstein's lawyer for a long period of time.
[01:42:32.778 --> 01:42:38.182]  But isn't the answer though to your question, isn't the answer now to file civil suits against Maxwell and go that angle?
[01:42:40.353 --> 01:42:51.420]  Actually, InfoWars is going to be looking at moving to intervene in some of these cases and bringing FOIA actions so that we get independent sourced information so that they can't continue to hide and cover up this stuff.
[01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:54.321]  Alright, Bob Barnes, great work as always, folks.
[01:42:55.202 --> 01:43:00.185]  RobertBarnesLLP.com and he's just got the legal expertise and the inside knowledge.
[01:43:00.205 --> 01:43:01.606]  When I come back, Patrick Cowley is with us.
[01:43:03.951 --> 01:43:09.720]  Well today, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:13.105]  I just devoured your cousin InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[01:43:34.261 --> 01:43:58.921]  What in the world's going on here?
[01:44:09.172 --> 01:44:22.602]  If you want to bet on your future, if you want to bet on Americana, if you want to bet on not being run by the shycoms, with Senate and House hearings now on how they literally fund the Democrats and MSM and CNN, the Chinese government does.
[01:44:22.662 --> 01:44:23.523]  It's all coming out.
[01:44:23.943 --> 01:44:24.823]  It's so devastating.
[01:44:24.904 --> 01:44:27.605]  And the government isn't even sure how to bring this out.
[01:44:27.646 --> 01:44:29.567]  They're starting to bring it out, going, Democrats, stop!
[01:44:29.667 --> 01:44:30.728]  Democrats aren't gonna stop.
[01:44:30.768 --> 01:44:32.068]  They're trying to cause a civil war right now.
[01:44:32.148 --> 01:44:33.429]  Like, they're starting to get some purchase.
[01:44:33.589 --> 01:44:34.330]  Trying to start a fire?
[01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:35.290]  They got some fire going.
[01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:39.913]  All the physical attacks, shootings, bombings, ice facilities getting attacked, dead people everywhere.
[01:44:39.933 --> 01:44:40.894]  It's on, folks.
[01:44:41.154 --> 01:44:44.596]  And if you think it's bad now, if they really get traction, it's gonna go insane.
[01:44:44.696 --> 01:44:47.517]  So now, more than you've ever done, yourself, me, for everybody.
[01:44:47.678 --> 01:44:51.240]  Spread the word about this broadcast on your local station, radio, TV.
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:53.401]  Tell folks about it at pollwars.com forward slash show.
[01:44:53.661 --> 01:44:58.925]  Let them know, hey, they wanted to shut this guy down because he exposed the Chinese government funding and controlling Hollywood.
[01:44:58.945 --> 01:45:00.606]  You wonder why Hollywood's anti-American?
[01:45:00.806 --> 01:45:03.528]  It's literally owned by the Chinese military.
[01:45:03.768 --> 01:45:05.309]  UT's basically run by China now.
[01:45:05.529 --> 01:45:06.310]  It's unbelievable.
[01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:08.191]  It's all coming out in Senate and House reports.
[01:45:08.311 --> 01:45:09.932]  But listen, everybody else is scared.
[01:45:10.353 --> 01:45:12.254]  Everybody else ran for the exits a long time ago.
[01:45:12.594 --> 01:45:20.710]  We knew if we told the truth, bet on you, you'd stand up, you'd see what happened, good people in government would see what happened, and that we would finally get people to take action.
[01:45:20.730 --> 01:45:22.594]  But somebody's got to make that first example.
[01:45:22.734 --> 01:45:24.337]  So I am honored to be in the position.
[01:45:25.450 --> 01:45:29.512]  I've had the enemy trying to destroy me right now, and the threats and all of it.
[01:45:29.852 --> 01:45:31.173]  It just makes me so alive.
[01:45:31.233 --> 01:45:34.074]  It's amazing, and I am very thankful to God for putting me in this position.
[01:45:34.374 --> 01:45:39.016]  With that said, I want to fight hard, and I need you to buy the products at infowarestore.com.

[01:46:16.392 --> 01:46:18.954]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:46:19.374 --> 01:46:20.736]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:46:21.116 --> 01:46:27.381]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.

[01:47:25.789 --> 01:47:27.189]  What a time to be alive.
[01:47:27.209 --> 01:47:30.950]  Oh, man.
[01:47:31.170 --> 01:47:32.790]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:34.651 --> 01:47:38.032]  Still on air, despite the fake news saying we're dead.
[01:47:38.112 --> 01:47:38.952]  No, we're alive.
[01:47:40.032 --> 01:47:40.572]  You're dead.
[01:47:42.472 --> 01:47:43.113]  We're still here.
[01:47:43.173 --> 01:47:43.953]  We have an audience.
[01:47:46.933 --> 01:47:50.954]  We independently fund ourselves with the millions and millions of audience members.
[01:47:51.394 --> 01:47:53.175]  The great supplements at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:47:53.295 --> 01:47:54.455]  We get the best guests on.
[01:47:55.748 --> 01:47:58.772]  Like Patrick Howley, who's been covering this Epstein story for a long time.
[01:47:58.812 --> 01:48:00.153]  So Patrick, let's do this.
[01:48:02.636 --> 01:48:10.786]  Let's really put into perspective here who Jeffrey Epstein was and why there was so much
[01:48:11.784 --> 01:48:22.714]  Interest amongst very high-profile, public, famous, influential, elite people to shut him up and have him dead if the case is he's actually dead.
[01:48:22.754 --> 01:48:26.018]  Whether he's dead or not, I guess we could debate, but they wanted him dead.
[01:48:26.058 --> 01:48:27.099]  There's no doubt about that.
[01:48:27.559 --> 01:48:28.540]  All the victims knew it.
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:29.781]  The lawyers' victims knew it.
[01:48:30.141 --> 01:48:30.622]  He knew it.
[01:48:31.142 --> 01:48:31.843]  Everybody knew it.
[01:48:32.263 --> 01:48:33.324]  And now somehow he's dead.
[01:48:34.269 --> 01:48:35.150]  So why, though?
[01:48:35.230 --> 01:48:36.430]  What's the big Epstein story?
[01:48:36.591 --> 01:48:40.093]  To audience people that may not know, you've been following this for a long time.
[01:48:40.173 --> 01:48:41.133]  Who is Jeffrey Epstein?
[01:48:41.173 --> 01:48:42.114]  How did he end up here?
[01:48:42.494 --> 01:48:44.295]  And why do all these elite people want him dead?
[01:48:45.636 --> 01:48:50.639]  Well, we're still finding out who Jeffrey Epstein was because it's still very unclear how he made his money.
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:53.361]  He's presented as a financier and a hedge fund manager.
[01:48:53.401 --> 01:48:58.244]  But if you look at his finances, the money was very mysteriously put into his accounts.
[01:48:58.645 --> 01:49:03.888]  If you look at Mark Epstein, his brother, who's a real estate person, also a lot of mysterious wealth.
[01:49:04.332 --> 01:49:16.815]  We know from the former Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, when he was interviewing with the Trump transition team, he was asked about the fact that he gave Epstein a sweetheart deal the last time around when he was convicted of pedophilia.
[01:49:17.215 --> 01:49:26.538]  Alex Acosta identified Epstein as a member of intelligence, and he was told from high up, Robert Mueller of course being the FBI director at the time, to lay off of the case.
[01:49:27.008 --> 01:49:40.172]  Now, Epstein was a socialite in Palm Beach, in that area, and he was taking wealthy people, including Hollywood celebrities, like Kevin Spacey, who recently had his charges dropped against him, possibly in return for cooperation.
[01:49:40.512 --> 01:49:48.374]  Like Bill Clinton, at least 27 times, he was flying them on his private jet and taking them down to his island, Pedophile Island, Little St.
[01:49:48.394 --> 01:49:53.876]  John Island, where there was a temple that was stocked with a lot of surveillance cameras
[01:49:54.281 --> 01:49:55.483]  We're good to go.
[01:50:10.836 --> 01:50:30.275]  Or let's say, you know, you're a police officer and you go bust, you know, a drug dealer, and he's got, you know, a small-time deal, but he's got some, you know, cocaine, whatever, selling drugs, and you take it to your upper, you know, your boss or whatever, and you're saying, hey, I got this guy doing this, and he says, okay, look, I need you to let him go, he's an informant for us, and so I just need you to sit this case down.
[01:50:30.315 --> 01:50:31.096]  Well, you're kind of frustrated.
[01:50:31.116 --> 01:50:31.576]  What does that mean?
[01:50:31.916 --> 01:50:35.119]  Well, that means the cops are using him to pinpoint other drug dealers.
[01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:37.761]  I mean, that's basically what's going on.
[01:50:38.822 --> 01:50:39.842]  But it's not even that.
[01:50:40.162 --> 01:50:51.348]  It's that the FBI was using Epstein to blackmail people to put them in positions of power and influence and then control culture, control society, control politics, control the flow of information.
[01:50:52.008 --> 01:50:54.650]  And that's what he was being used for as an informant.
[01:50:54.690 --> 01:50:56.691]  Not like, oh, I'm going to help you get the bad guys.
[01:50:56.971 --> 01:50:58.232]  He never helped any bad guys.
[01:50:58.272 --> 01:51:00.073]  He never brought anybody in.
[01:51:00.333 --> 01:51:02.374]  So the whole thing was a blackmail thing.
[01:51:02.414 --> 01:51:04.275]  The FBI was using the dark
[01:51:10.757 --> 01:51:11.237]  Absolutely.
[01:51:11.297 --> 01:51:19.800]  He had Clinton and Gore in his pocket, and he was obsessed with getting close to Donald Trump, which is why he was constantly hanging around Mar-a-Lago, which is why he was banned from Mar-a-Lago.
[01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:34.225]  Now, the fact that this bombshell witness, Virginia Roberts, was, as a teenager, employed at Mar-a-Lago only continues to confirm what I've known for years, which is that Donald Trump has been on a mission for about a decade to try to bring Jeffrey Epstein to justice,
[01:51:34.545 --> 01:51:38.426]  And use it as a placeholder case to bring down the other big fish in human trafficking.
[01:51:38.466 --> 01:51:40.586]  Well, now hold right there, because this is huge what you're saying.
[01:51:40.606 --> 01:51:41.566]  I really want you to get into this.
[01:51:42.226 --> 01:51:43.767]  You've been following this for a decade.
[01:51:44.007 --> 01:51:49.648]  You believe that what Donald Trump knew, and let's remember, he put out a tweet saying pedophiles need to hang, paraphrasing.
[01:51:50.268 --> 01:51:56.389]  But you think Trump has been following this, known about this, been trying to stop what Epstein is doing, obviously knew the Clintons were involved.
[01:51:56.829 --> 01:52:03.050]  You think he's been doing this for 10 years, and you say your research is what's led you to that belief.
[01:52:04.187 --> 01:52:04.888]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:52:05.428 --> 01:52:10.153]  Trump assisted the last prosecution effort against Epstein when he was busted for pedophilia.
[01:52:10.513 --> 01:52:20.063]  Unfortunately, under Robert Mueller, Epstein got a sweetheart deal and got out and continued partying with socialites like Katie Couric and George Stephanopoulos and the Clintons and big-time actors.
[01:52:20.543 --> 01:52:26.850]  Now, in this most recent version with Trump as the president, you know, this was supposed to be a placeholder case to bring down
[01:52:27.242 --> 01:52:29.567]  All of these people who are involved in human trafficking.
[01:52:29.768 --> 01:52:32.093]  There are now so many links to human trafficking.
[01:52:32.173 --> 01:52:37.425]  I was going to say, I mean, I'm sure you've been seeing like Operation Broken Heart, the thousands of pedophiles being arrested nationwide.
[01:52:39.187 --> 01:52:40.107]  Oh, yes, absolutely.
[01:52:40.147 --> 01:52:42.308]  This is a big Trump administration initiative.
[01:52:42.548 --> 01:52:45.268]  The NXIVM sex cult case was also a placeholder case.
[01:52:45.308 --> 01:52:50.149]  Of course, we know Mexican children were gaming the immigration system and coming into this country.
[01:52:50.629 --> 01:53:00.871]  And that case is also very relevant because we know that the Rainbow Cultural Gardens, which were overseen by Hillary Clinton's donor, Claire Bronfman, were actually experimenting on children.
[01:53:01.131 --> 01:53:05.252]  And they were based in Mexico and Guatemala, in addition to the United States.
[01:53:05.552 --> 01:53:13.998]  So you can trace the entire map of human trafficking into this country, including land in the southwestern United States that is owned by the company CEMEX.
[01:53:14.418 --> 01:53:21.343]  CEMEX, the majority stakeholder in it, is Bronfman Rothschild, a firm that is run by Claire Bronfman's brother, Matthew Bronfman.
[01:53:21.584 --> 01:53:24.626]  So they even own the land that the child slaves come up over.
[01:53:25.066 --> 01:53:33.531]  The entire human trafficking network is being exposed and pulled apart, and it's all linked to satanic elites who practice the Luciferian religion.
[01:53:33.911 --> 01:53:41.656]  And based on the teachings of Aleister Crowley, and this is all true, it's not a conspiracy theory, they do sacrifice children on a pentagram.
[01:53:44.077 --> 01:53:47.880]  We don't have to get too into this, but the audience can go down and do this.
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:49.961]  If you really want a red pill, if you want a rabbit hit,
[01:53:51.308 --> 01:53:55.252]  They get these ancient texts and they actually believe they're doing these rituals.
[01:53:55.313 --> 01:54:09.529]  They ingest drugs, they do all kinds of hallucinogens, they engage in sex stuff that can be tied with these... They're doing stuff that the average person can't even conceive, but it's ancient stuff that they've just been involved with forever.
[01:54:10.495 --> 01:54:12.317]  And so, where do you think it goes from here?
[01:54:12.357 --> 01:54:24.389]  It's all being exposed, but is enough going to come out to the average individual where they really have an awakening of the soul, of the spirit, the flesh, the mind, that it's like, wow, we're really in this.
[01:54:24.429 --> 01:54:25.651]  There really are forces of evil.
[01:54:25.671 --> 01:54:29.074]  I mean, I look at the average Christian that reads the Bible that has no idea this is going on.
[01:54:29.114 --> 01:54:33.739]  It's like, hey, I mean, it's time for people to get active in the spiritual war here.
[01:54:35.276 --> 01:54:37.437]  Well, it really is up to the Trump administration.
[01:54:37.517 --> 01:54:47.020]  The reason why we had so much success with the NXIVM case is because there was a sensationalistic celebrity trial at Brooklyn Federal Court that was being waged by the Department of Justice and I got a conviction.
[01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:50.281]  And I think Claire Bronfman is going to face additional charges for visa fraud.
[01:54:51.221 --> 01:55:00.629]  But, you know, the force of the mainstream media is still pretty potent in terms of brainwashing the average Ellen DeGeneres viewer into thinking that these things are not happening.
[01:55:00.729 --> 01:55:02.050]  Do you think this is a breaking point?
[01:55:02.090 --> 01:55:04.853]  Because, I mean, the average individual knows 1 plus 1 still equals 2.
[01:55:05.653 --> 01:55:08.236]  And they're trying to say 1 plus 1 equals 3 with this Epstein deal.
[01:55:08.256 --> 01:55:10.818]  I mean, I see a major awakening happening here.
[01:55:12.142 --> 01:55:17.425]  Oh absolutely, I think it's happening all over the world and I think Donald Trump is definitely at the center of it.
[01:55:17.825 --> 01:55:31.293]  I think these things are going to continue and I think we absolutely cannot drop the ball on this opportunity because the entire world is looking at the situation right now and realizing that there are very corrupt people close to the Clintons who are now dying under mysterious circumstances.
[01:55:31.593 --> 01:55:34.455]  This has been going on for a long time and it's right in front of our faces now.
[01:55:34.935 --> 01:55:39.961]  We need to all seize this opportunity because, you know, this is something that can truly change the world.
[01:55:40.321 --> 01:55:41.362]  No, that's exactly it.
[01:55:41.582 --> 01:55:43.725]  And we've got a social media team here.
[01:55:43.825 --> 01:55:48.189]  We do like promotional videos during the break, stuff for our subscribers, our accounts and everything.
[01:55:48.230 --> 01:55:51.873]  And they came in here and they're like, hey, just give us like 30 seconds to a minute.
[01:55:51.994 --> 01:55:53.175]  And that's exactly what I said.
[01:55:53.215 --> 01:55:56.819]  It's like I see a window of opportunity here where
[01:55:57.878 --> 01:55:59.618]  People that aren't necessarily politically involved.
[01:55:59.658 --> 01:56:04.620]  It's like the whole thing, like ratings for sporting events and attendance is going down because it's not delivering anything.
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:05.780]  There's nothing.
[01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:10.681]  It's a superficial surface value, which is sad because that's where society is.
[01:56:10.701 --> 01:56:12.462]  I mean, really, society is just so shallow now.
[01:56:13.102 --> 01:56:13.902]  Everything's on the surface.
[01:56:13.962 --> 01:56:14.763]  Everything's superficial.
[01:56:14.783 --> 01:56:17.883]  So they can't even... It's almost that they don't even have the ability to go so deep.
[01:56:17.923 --> 01:56:27.006]  But I think this is a huge moment because the average American citizen can see this story, look into Epstein, see the cover-up, and just be like, OK, wait a second.
[01:56:27.867 --> 01:56:30.068]  Clearly this guy was murdered.
[01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:42.836]  Clearly the mainstream, because that's what was my awakening process, is I just saw an event happen that I never questioned things, I never thought TV media would lie, you know, and I just saw an event happening and then looked into it for myself and then was like, whoa!
[01:56:43.377 --> 01:56:44.958]  It was, I mean, everything clicks.
[01:56:45.038 --> 01:56:54.084]  When you see that there are people just, when you see there are people consciously lying to you, trying to deceive you on air, I mean, that's a, that's a life-changing experience.
[01:56:54.104 --> 01:56:54.544]  It was for me.
[01:56:54.624 --> 01:56:56.085]  I think that's where we're at here, Patrick.
[01:56:57.011 --> 01:56:59.413]  Yeah, I don't think we're in a war between right or left.
[01:56:59.473 --> 01:57:02.576]  I think we're in a war between the 2D narrative and the 3D narrative.
[01:57:02.977 --> 01:57:10.664]  When Hillary Clinton finally sobered up and gave her concession speech after losing the election, both her and Bill Clinton wore purple.
[01:57:10.724 --> 01:57:13.267]  Bill Clinton wore a purple tie, she wore a purple dress.
[01:57:13.547 --> 01:57:13.707]  I don't
[01:57:32.332 --> 01:57:35.335]  This is going to take Donald Trump doing everything he can.
[01:57:35.595 --> 01:57:37.737]  It's also going to take us doing everything that we can.
[01:57:38.177 --> 01:57:42.782]  I don't believe that Jeffrey Epstein was truly a believer in this Luciferian religion.
[01:57:43.082 --> 01:57:46.525]  I believe that he was an asset who was simply blackmailing politicians.
[01:57:46.545 --> 01:57:49.568]  All right, let's get into the final five minutes here with Patrick Talley.
[01:57:49.588 --> 01:57:50.268]  Let's talk about that.
[01:57:52.170 --> 01:57:53.551]  Thomas, this is important.
[01:57:54.873 --> 01:57:55.333]  I'm 45 years old.
[01:57:57.179 --> 01:58:06.627]  When I was 35, I swam to 2 miles a day sometimes, and would jog, and couldn't lose weight, because I didn't have the missing links.
[01:58:06.827 --> 01:58:11.411]  I was deficient in things that nobody ever told me I was deficient in.
[01:58:12.071 --> 01:58:17.255]  I knew all about the private Federal Reserve, the Trilateral Commission, the New World Order, Jeffrey Epstein, the pedophile rings.
[01:58:17.576 --> 01:58:22.540]  I knew all about geopolitical systems, and the old Soviet Union, and how the globals put the Chai Kams in.
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:24.441]  But I didn't know about PQQ.
[01:58:25.142 --> 01:58:26.022]  I didn't know about CoQ10.
[01:58:27.594 --> 01:58:28.955]  I didn't know about all this.
[01:58:29.756 --> 01:58:31.437]  And I didn't know about Clean Iodine.
[01:58:32.518 --> 01:58:34.080]  And yeah, I want to fund my operation.
[01:58:35.201 --> 01:58:43.448]  I want you to get products that have changed my life, and changed so many other people's lives, that have 98% reviews, and then experience that I'm not BSing you.
[01:58:44.248 --> 01:58:50.334]  So that for some of you, maybe in the first time in your life, you're going to experience somebody that treats you like they want to be treated.
[01:58:50.354 --> 01:58:51.875]  Let me tell you something right now.
[01:58:53.196 --> 01:58:53.977]  You see DNA Force?
[01:58:55.089 --> 01:59:08.379]  I went out to top manufacturers that are the most respected, most highly tested, and I said, I want the strongest PQQ CoQ10 overall formula that has pure, non-synthetic stuff in it that's ever been put on the market.
[01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:11.842]  And they said, well, that's like a $22 each model.
[01:59:12.362 --> 01:59:14.083]  I said, I want to put $50 a model in it.
[01:59:15.064 --> 01:59:16.125]  They said, nobody's ever done that.
[01:59:16.758 --> 01:59:19.422]  Then I signed a contract to double the amount I was gonna buy.
[01:59:19.682 --> 01:59:22.946]  I got it down to thirty-something dollars a bottle for what it cost me to make this.
[01:59:23.667 --> 01:59:24.668]  Nobody does that!
[01:59:25.549 --> 01:59:31.838]  Ladies and gentlemen, you read what's in this, and you research every ingredient in this, and then you experience it for yourself.
[01:59:32.679 --> 01:59:33.380]  It's incredible.
[01:59:35.336 --> 01:59:46.143]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.
[01:59:46.684 --> 01:59:49.265]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:59:54.629 --> 02:00:00.553]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.718 --> 02:00:18.780]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:18.980 --> 02:00:20.180]  Owen Schroer here with you.
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:24.361]  We've got one segment left with Patrick Howley, at Howley Reporter on Twitter.
[02:00:24.681 --> 02:00:33.783]  Now, I did a little, I'm not much of an artist, but I did a little rendition, a visual representation of what Patrick was talking about in the last segment.
[02:00:33.823 --> 02:00:35.324]  2D news versus 3D news.
[02:00:35.344 --> 02:00:36.824]  See, the 2D news says, oh,
[02:00:37.967 --> 02:00:38.907]  Here's the surface.
[02:00:39.507 --> 02:00:40.608]  Jeffrey Epstein is dead.
[02:00:40.628 --> 02:00:41.548]  He committed suicide.
[02:00:42.168 --> 02:00:44.568]  The 3D News says, well, here's everything behind it.
[02:00:44.768 --> 02:00:45.568]  So here's what it is.
[02:00:47.189 --> 02:00:49.349]  2D News gives you two shapes right here.
[02:00:50.389 --> 02:00:55.550]  And you see two shapes, and you say, A or B. And the 2D News says B is the bigger shape.
[02:00:56.111 --> 02:00:59.411]  And you look at it, and you say, oh, OK, 2D News is right.
[02:00:59.491 --> 02:01:00.491]  Big is the better shape.
[02:01:01.132 --> 02:01:03.212]  Oh, but you see, the 3D News tells you the truth.
[02:01:04.383 --> 02:01:21.596]  When you get away from the surface level view, you see that A, because of its depth, is actually much bigger than B. But because the 2D news only shows you the surface angle, you never know that they're lying to you.
[02:01:22.417 --> 02:01:27.361]  And so we're just simply here showing you the background, putting all the pieces together, letting you know the real story.
[02:01:28.308 --> 02:01:32.050]  While they're trying to say, oh no, nothing to see here, Jeffrey Epstein just committed suicide.
[02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:34.252]  So Patrick Halle, you've been following Epstein for decades.
[02:01:35.112 --> 02:01:36.433]  What do you think comes next?
[02:01:36.493 --> 02:01:40.355]  What is the most significant thing this audience needs to know about Epstein as we move forward?
[02:01:41.436 --> 02:01:43.978]  Well look, there are at least 102 Jane Doe's.
[02:01:43.998 --> 02:01:46.920]  There are at least 102 known victims of this.
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:50.282]  They all don't have to be represented by Gloria Allred or Lisa Bloom.
[02:01:50.302 --> 02:01:53.984]  They can be represented by Robert or any other lawyer who wants to take these cases on.
[02:01:54.352 --> 02:01:54.652]  So
[02:02:14.301 --> 02:02:14.841]  I think so.
[02:02:31.892 --> 02:02:37.053]  However, the satanic activity that was going on on that island was closely monitored and used for blackmail.
[02:02:37.373 --> 02:02:41.914]  I think that the fact that he was not really a member of their club made it easier to kill him.
[02:02:42.234 --> 02:02:53.297]  But we have to go at his handlers and we have to understand who the people were who were, you know, behind him because ultimately that's going to reveal the true power structure of our world.
[02:02:53.677 --> 02:02:59.618]  The media doesn't want to tell us the true power structure of the world or the fact that the right versus left paradigm is mostly false.
[02:02:59.938 --> 02:03:11.381]  And it was Alex Jones who, when I was in high school, really woke me up to the fact that the Iraq War was being used by Bush to play both sides and create a right versus left division that was not genuine in that case.
[02:03:11.461 --> 02:03:14.322]  It was truly the elites against the other people of the world.
[02:03:15.862 --> 02:03:20.743]  Well, and so all we really have here, which is, it should be like the biggest news story.
[02:03:20.763 --> 02:03:27.925]  I mean, if you tune into news today, it's like barely even a breath of wind that they're breathing into this Epstein story, but it's huge.
[02:03:28.993 --> 02:03:29.733]  It's all coming out.
[02:03:30.734 --> 02:03:39.198]  Jeffrey Epstein being used as an FBI informant, was involved with sex trafficking, human trafficking, who knows what else, potentially human sacrifice.
[02:03:39.238 --> 02:03:48.303]  I mean, folks, just look at the other stories about quote-unquote orgy islands, like the stuff they had off of the islands of Italy where sometimes it ends in murder.
[02:03:49.096 --> 02:03:52.298]  So, do you think though, I mean, what do you think is going to happen?
[02:03:52.318 --> 02:03:53.999]  Do you think America is ever going to learn about this?
[02:03:54.019 --> 02:03:55.300]  Do you think this is ever going to come out?
[02:03:55.500 --> 02:04:03.605]  Or do you think it's going to be buried either by dark forces or buried by the good forces that brought this evil down but don't think the American public can handle this?
[02:04:04.656 --> 02:04:07.659]  I'm determined to make sure that this stuff comes out as I have been for years.
[02:04:07.679 --> 02:04:10.922]  And look, there are a long list of placeholder cases.
[02:04:11.162 --> 02:04:14.345]  The Epstein has moved the ball down the field quite a bit, as did Nexium.
[02:04:14.585 --> 02:04:20.410]  There's also a human trafficking civil case now against the Church of Scientology, which is close to the Clintons, which is linked to the occult.
[02:04:20.970 --> 02:04:22.752]  There are other human trafficking cases.
[02:04:23.032 --> 02:04:26.876]  And if you look at Ed Buck, the Hillary Clinton donor, now accused of human trafficking.
[02:04:27.576 --> 02:04:30.058]  Harvey Weinstein was accused of human trafficking.
[02:04:30.118 --> 02:04:31.860]  So there is a long list of targets.
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:38.243]  As long as Trump is the Commander-in-Chief, then we have a chance to use law enforcement to continue to prosecute these cases.
[02:04:38.524 --> 02:04:47.829]  And I'm going to do everything to expose Child Protective Services and other things this week in my writings for the Epoch Times in order to get that stuff out there.
[02:04:48.309 --> 02:04:53.912]  And I encourage you to follow all of my reporting because this week for me is really the go week on all this stuff.
[02:04:54.332 --> 02:04:58.755]  Alright, at Howley Reporter on Twitter is where you can follow that work.
[02:04:59.095 --> 02:05:00.656]  We'll be right back with more of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:03.406 --> 02:05:19.264]  Before I started working at InfoWars I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com and there's one product that's offered at InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements and that's DNA Force Plus.
[02:05:19.504 --> 02:05:23.008]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests
[02:05:23.408 --> 02:05:26.869]  Tellomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[02:05:27.250 --> 02:05:35.653]  So I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[02:05:35.673 --> 02:05:39.034]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive.
[02:05:39.094 --> 02:05:39.355]  Why?
[02:05:39.415 --> 02:05:41.936]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[02:05:42.216 --> 02:05:47.358]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support.
[02:05:47.918 --> 02:05:52.184]  And they came and they went, but DNA Force Plus is still there.
[02:05:52.524 --> 02:05:53.766]  It is the elite supplement.
[02:05:54.206 --> 02:05:57.851]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[02:05:57.891 --> 02:06:03.739]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:06:09.025 --> 02:06:14.909]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[02:06:14.929 --> 02:06:17.211]  It's Owen Troyer.
[02:06:17.811 --> 02:06:20.553]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:22.975 --> 02:06:26.977]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:27.018 --> 02:06:29.799]  Paul Joseph Watson about to be joining us, but first...
[02:06:30.782 --> 02:06:32.643]  We've got one day left, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:32.924 --> 02:06:44.973]  One day left of the Banniversary Sale at InfoWareStore.com, which includes free shipping store-wide up to 60% off top-selling supplements at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:06:45.533 --> 02:06:47.154]  Double Patriot points with every order.
[02:06:47.755 --> 02:06:50.037]  Go check out all the great reviews of all the supplements.
[02:06:50.077 --> 02:06:52.859]  Check out the air filters, the water filters, also on sale.
[02:06:55.461 --> 02:06:56.942]  And read the reviews on that.
[02:06:57.022 --> 02:06:59.524]  And again, we don't have to
[02:07:01.328 --> 02:07:02.709]  Beg corporate sponsors for money?
[02:07:02.749 --> 02:07:03.290]  We don't have any.
[02:07:04.311 --> 02:07:10.856]  We don't have to cater to some big sponsorship corporate marketing program's agenda.
[02:07:11.037 --> 02:07:11.697]  We don't have one.
[02:07:12.478 --> 02:07:21.586]  We have you, the audience, and we have our independent shop, Infowarsstore.com, which funds everything we do here, which you've seen what Alex Jones has done.
[02:07:23.064 --> 02:07:27.146]  With your support at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:07:27.466 --> 02:07:35.209]  More reporters, more studios, more live shows, more breaking reports, more, more, more, and this is in the face of us getting less and less access.
[02:07:35.769 --> 02:07:38.911]  Now you are the missing link.
[02:07:39.673 --> 02:07:42.335]  That allows InfoWars to get into the public spectrum.
[02:07:42.615 --> 02:07:46.658]  So we ask you to always share those links of InfoWars.com slash show.
[02:07:47.039 --> 02:07:50.962]  Tell people about the Alex Jones Show and everything we're doing here at InfoWars.
[02:07:51.002 --> 02:07:53.704]  Because this is a major window of opportunity, folks.
[02:07:54.644 --> 02:07:56.246]  Nobody's buying this Epstein thing.
[02:07:57.259 --> 02:07:58.219]  Nobody's buying it.
[02:07:58.260 --> 02:08:02.701]  It's going to be hot for maybe another day or two as far as the average citizen, the public, is concerned.
[02:08:03.021 --> 02:08:04.202]  Then they're not going to care anymore.
[02:08:04.662 --> 02:08:08.824]  You need to say, hey, look, you're not going to believe this Epstein thing because you're being lied to.
[02:08:08.884 --> 02:08:09.884]  Here's what's really going on.
[02:08:09.964 --> 02:08:10.685]  Check this out.
[02:08:10.985 --> 02:08:14.066]  Check out this broadcast at infowars.com slash show.
[02:08:14.686 --> 02:08:17.748]  This is how you awaken people, folks, and this is a big window of opportunity.
[02:08:18.048 --> 02:08:19.308]  Do not let it close.
[02:08:19.368 --> 02:08:22.569]  Paul Joseph Watson, you've been covering this for a while.
[02:08:22.630 --> 02:08:25.571]  You did a video, I believe it was a week or two ago, Pedophiles Run the World.
[02:08:27.104 --> 02:08:32.292]  That seems to be even more important now that Epstein is dead than it was then when you put it out.
[02:08:32.332 --> 02:08:36.980]  But what do you make of Epstein's death or do you think he's still alive?
[02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:38.864]  What do you think is going on, Paul Joseph Watson?
[02:08:40.598 --> 02:08:54.786]  Well, that is one of the emerging conspiracy theories quote that's come out that they actually swapped him out with somebody else or that, you know, he's been transferred back to Pedo Island and everyone else gets off scot-free and that was the deal that he did with them.
[02:08:55.106 --> 02:08:58.748]  As far as I've seen on that, it's just random posts on forums so far.
[02:08:58.788 --> 02:09:01.870]  What we do know, Owen, today, this came out today,
[02:09:02.651 --> 02:09:06.994]  Top headline on InfoWars, Epstein's cellmate was transferred out day before suicide.
[02:09:07.435 --> 02:09:20.184]  So it turns out that he did actually have a cellmate who would have witnessed what happened to Epstein, but just by coincidence, less than 24 hours before his apparent suicide, this cellmate got transferred out.
[02:09:21.002 --> 02:09:34.304]  Of course, we know they claim they didn't have cameras within the jail cell itself, but they did have cameras trained on the outside on the doors, so they would have picked up whatever was happening if anyone was going in who was coming out.
[02:09:35.144 --> 02:09:37.545]  Rumours that those cameras mysteriously failed.
[02:09:38.405 --> 02:09:41.425]  So it's just faux pas on top of faux pas.
[02:09:41.786 --> 02:09:47.947]  Of course, the prison warden and the chief psychologist had signed off to confirm that Epstein was not suicidal.
[02:09:48.407 --> 02:09:50.107]  In the days before his death,
[02:09:51.266 --> 02:09:56.289]  Prison insiders and other guards have come out and said that he was in quote good spirits.
[02:09:56.850 --> 02:10:03.834]  He had warned guards and this is all in mainstream media reports that others had tried to kill him were planning to kill him.
[02:10:03.874 --> 02:10:05.355]  He told guards he told prisoners.
[02:10:06.386 --> 02:10:06.967]  I don't think so.
[02:10:26.118 --> 02:10:26.979]  He turns up dead.
[02:10:27.019 --> 02:10:41.050]  Of course, we have the media that has spun the biggest conspiracy theory of the past two decades, probably, in Russian collusion, now saying that talking about Epstein possibly having been killed as a result of a conspiracy is hate speech.
[02:10:41.110 --> 02:10:47.575]  They're now removing YouTube videos which talk about that, so maybe they'll remove mine later on today, even though it's got over 600,000 views.
[02:10:47.615 --> 02:10:50.337]  Which is, of course, the most 1984 thing you could ever imagine.
[02:10:50.437 --> 02:10:52.659]  I mean, that's right out of 1984, 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:10:53.199 --> 02:10:55.101]  But it's not even... That's even more complex!
[02:10:55.401 --> 02:10:58.044]  We're dealing with 1 plus 1 equals 3 right now.
[02:10:58.465 --> 02:11:00.407]  The official narrative says 1 plus 1 equals 3.
[02:11:01.128 --> 02:11:05.154]  I'm not even going to sit here and say who's responsible for it because at this point I'm open-minded it could be anything.
[02:11:05.414 --> 02:11:06.435]  Again, I could see how...
[02:11:07.455 --> 02:11:11.397]  He cuts a deal and they basically do a body switch and say, oh, he's dead.
[02:11:11.437 --> 02:11:12.457]  Put him in witness protection.
[02:11:12.798 --> 02:11:15.019]  I could also see he could easily have been killed.
[02:11:15.039 --> 02:11:17.120]  There are a lot of people very powerful that want him killed, too.
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:22.342]  So I'm just sitting here saying, OK, the official narrative is 1 plus 1 equals 3.
[02:11:22.382 --> 02:11:24.763]  I know 1 plus 1 doesn't equal 3.
[02:11:25.143 --> 02:11:27.704]  So I'm going to find out how this 1 plus 1 actually equals 2.
[02:11:29.125 --> 02:11:30.786]  And don't you think this is a huge opportunity?
[02:11:30.806 --> 02:11:32.748]  I mean, nobody is buying this.
[02:11:32.888 --> 02:11:35.810]  I mean, the average person that's not even political isn't buying this.
[02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:36.631]  They're like, oh, okay.
[02:11:36.651 --> 02:11:46.298]  I mean, people need to see how the mainstream media is trying to cover up and how the real story here is much more interesting than, oh, financier commits suicide in jail.
[02:11:48.311 --> 02:11:53.834]  Yeah, and as you said, once they get a lockdown on the narrative, it's going to disappear after a couple of days.
[02:11:53.935 --> 02:11:58.457]  Now we see the emerging narrative is that the staffing was inadequate.
[02:11:58.497 --> 02:12:03.481]  So we know he was taken off suicide watch a week after allegedly trying to commit suicide.
[02:12:03.801 --> 02:12:07.203]  But even if he was not on suicide watch, which is what they claim,
[02:12:07.959 --> 02:12:13.122]  As per their procedure in the jail, they have to check on him every 30 minutes.
[02:12:13.202 --> 02:12:17.365]  Now we found out it was hours before his death that nobody checked on him.
[02:12:17.805 --> 02:12:24.669]  Oh, but the staff are overworked and they're inadequate, so now they're throwing the jail guards under the bus, even though
[02:12:25.535 --> 02:12:33.338]  In this same correctional facility, this jail, they've had one suicide in 21 years, which was the death of a drug kingpin in 1998.
[02:12:34.439 --> 02:12:38.420]  They've had a bunch of other suicide attempts, but in every single other attempt, it's been stopped.
[02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:38.700]  Right.
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:39.781]  I mean, it obviously wasn't suicide.
[02:12:39.881 --> 02:12:47.684]  Unless he literally banged his head against the wall for 30 minutes until it was a pulp, which was not true, because we saw the pictures, there's no way this was suicide.
[02:12:47.704 --> 02:12:49.225]  So, Paul, let me ask you this.
[02:12:49.265 --> 02:12:52.186]  I mean, let's really try to war game this out here.
[02:12:53.783 --> 02:13:17.843]  I mean, to me, I think there's only three potential options here, and that's that either he cut a deal with the Justice Department or the Trump Administration or whoever, and he said, look, they're gonna try to kill me, they obviously knew that's true, so he cut a deal, and they said, fine, we're gonna do a dead man switch, pull you out of here, claim you're dead, put you in witness protection, and then you can cooperate with us during this investigation.
[02:13:18.563 --> 02:13:21.546]  Two, and this is the craziest one,
[02:13:22.841 --> 02:13:29.903]  I mean, how many people would have to be involved in actually killing Epstein for this to go off without anybody getting caught?
[02:13:29.943 --> 02:13:32.084]  I mean, you had to have people in the jail?
[02:13:32.104 --> 02:13:33.544]  You have to have people in the federal government?
[02:13:33.564 --> 02:13:35.485]  You have to have people just in the medical?
[02:13:35.525 --> 02:13:46.288]  I mean, literally, how many people would you have to get to cooperate to actually pull this off and either have him killed in jail or sneak him out of there to get him back to whatever?
[02:13:46.308 --> 02:13:49.289]  I mean, so which one do you think is more likely?
[02:13:49.529 --> 02:13:51.350]  To me, both are more likely than suicide.
[02:13:53.106 --> 02:13:55.928]  I mean, there's another option that maybe they threatened to kill his family.
[02:13:55.948 --> 02:14:09.739]  I don't know how close he was to his family or how exposed they were, but maybe they threatened to kill his family and got to him that way and basically forced him into a Gary Webb type situation where, you know, he shot himself in the head, what, two or three times apparently.
[02:14:10.260 --> 02:14:14.483]  But just the basic facts of it, it's almost impossible to commit suicide.
[02:14:14.543 --> 02:14:16.124]  What did he hang himself with?
[02:14:16.565 --> 02:14:20.508]  You've had ex-inmates of that same correctional center in New York saying,
[02:14:21.264 --> 02:14:23.545]  Literally, the bed sheets are like paper.
[02:14:23.585 --> 02:14:25.185]  They're not strong enough to hold anything.
[02:14:25.205 --> 02:14:28.707]  They would just tear if anyone tried to hang themselves with the bed sheets.
[02:14:29.107 --> 02:14:32.328]  You know, he's had all the shoelaces, all the rope, whatever's in there, removed.
[02:14:33.108 --> 02:14:36.689]  The floor and the ceiling, the ceiling is like nine feet high.
[02:14:36.729 --> 02:14:39.270]  There's literally nothing to hang yourself on.
[02:14:39.310 --> 02:14:40.011]  There's no hook.
[02:14:40.051 --> 02:14:41.351]  There's no anything in there.
[02:14:41.771 --> 02:14:46.433]  And this is from people who have been in that prison for years, who have come out and told this to the media.
[02:14:46.773 --> 02:14:49.634]  So just the basic mechanics of how he possibly did it.
[02:14:50.308 --> 02:14:54.290]  Given all this, kind of override so incompetence they didn't check on him.
[02:14:54.690 --> 02:15:00.532]  Even if no one was checking on him, how did he physically manage it when it's impossible according to the prisoners that were in there?
[02:15:00.992 --> 02:15:01.592]  So I don't know.
[02:15:01.832 --> 02:15:03.973]  A lot more is going to come out over the next few days.
[02:15:03.993 --> 02:15:06.214]  But as he said, they're going to put the lid on it.
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:16.406]  What they're still doing with Rubio and Joe Scarborough and these others is ludicrously claiming that Russian agents killed him to cover up for Trump and the Trump body count.
[02:15:16.686 --> 02:15:19.608]  What is the Trump body count in comparison to the Clinton body count?
[02:15:20.008 --> 02:15:28.253]  Trump was the only high-profile guy who distanced himself from Epstein the first time he found out about this alleged sex trafficking.
[02:15:28.313 --> 02:15:29.034]  Nobody else did.
[02:15:29.314 --> 02:15:31.855]  Trump helped the lawyers of the victims of Epstein.
[02:15:32.236 --> 02:15:35.658]  So the fact they're still trying to pin this on Trump is totally ludicrous.
[02:15:36.158 --> 02:15:37.459]  You know, I can't even imagine.
[02:15:37.539 --> 02:15:43.603]  I mean, I don't get it in my personal life here, but it's like, I can't even imagine what Trump is going through.
[02:15:43.623 --> 02:15:49.167]  I mean, I triple-check, quadruple-think anybody I even talk to or get close to.
[02:15:49.187 --> 02:15:51.349]  I can't even imagine Donald Trump.
[02:15:51.729 --> 02:15:57.693]  So he's not hopping into bed with these minors because someone's trying to, from Epstein Island, trying to get him over there.
[02:15:57.713 --> 02:16:01.236]  He's not even in his personal profile to ever do anything like that.
[02:16:02.827 --> 02:16:05.609]  President Trump was sworn in in January of 2017.
[02:16:05.669 --> 02:16:12.873]  The average farm journal and poll had him at about 50% with farmers.
[02:16:13.554 --> 02:16:28.203]  Fast forward to August 2019, two and a half years later, and he's at 79% in the farm journal survey, which is the most respected, and other farm journals show him as high as 90%.
[02:16:29.784 --> 02:16:35.969]  No president since these journals have existed has had numbers this high.
[02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:38.251]  Now why am I so excited about that?
[02:16:38.331 --> 02:16:39.412]  Why am I so proud of that?
[02:16:42.154 --> 02:16:43.996]  Farmers got assaulted by the Democrats.
[02:16:45.411 --> 02:16:52.015]  Trump came in and was reasonable about it and said, hey, foreign countries have internal tariffs.
[02:16:52.155 --> 02:16:52.955]  I'll get rid of those.
[02:16:53.415 --> 02:16:57.477]  We don't need all these subsidies, but we'll actually let you compete directly into those markets.
[02:16:58.298 --> 02:17:02.480]  And when China put massive tariffs on U.S.
[02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:05.762]  farmers, their support for Trump only went up.
[02:17:06.202 --> 02:17:11.385]  And then, when China banned a week ago all U.S.
[02:17:11.405 --> 02:17:11.785]  produce
[02:17:14.008 --> 02:17:14.889]  Trump's numbers went up.
[02:17:15.669 --> 02:17:19.572]  Now, I talk about this all the time, but this is the key to everything.
[02:17:20.393 --> 02:17:31.461]  When Americans and free people know they're being dominated and assaulted and bullied, and they know that it's artificial and that it's from outside, they will rally and come together every time.
[02:17:32.802 --> 02:17:36.705]  You know, I harp on this constantly, that these globalists, the Democrats, are bullies.
[02:17:37.765 --> 02:17:54.116]  And they think that if they attack us, and lie about us, and call us Nazis, and physically come after us, and dox our homes, and tell us the American flag sucks, and that America's bad, that somehow we'll become demoralized, and kneel to them, bow to them.
[02:17:55.517 --> 02:17:56.338]  That's not what's happening.
[02:17:57.398 --> 02:18:00.841]  Americans were asleep before, because they thought everything was fine.
[02:18:02.079 --> 02:18:04.280]  Now Americans know that the country's in peril.
[02:18:04.640 --> 02:18:06.600]  And they know that Trump at Infowars is fighting.
[02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:09.521]  And so now, they're ready for a war.
[02:18:10.081 --> 02:18:11.121]  They're ready for a battle.
[02:18:12.021 --> 02:18:18.803]  And so when the Chi-Coms come in and say, we're going to put tariffs on your goods, they say, oh, we support Trump more.
[02:18:20.243 --> 02:18:28.465]  And then when they say, we're banning all your food, we're going to all cost each one of your families a large piece of their paycheck, because China imports a lot of food from us they can't produce.
[02:18:29.488 --> 02:18:30.630]  That's fine, go ahead and do that.
[02:18:31.130 --> 02:18:33.373]  Because you've been screwing our industry over forever.
[02:18:33.594 --> 02:18:39.361]  And the farmers get what the Rust Belt and the factories and the workers have gone through and they're standing up.
[02:18:39.601 --> 02:18:45.109]  Because farmers have a long history in this country of standing up to tyranny because they understand how the system operates.
[02:18:45.129 --> 02:18:47.752]  And Thomas Jefferson said it will be the yeoman farmers
[02:18:48.453 --> 02:18:58.360]  That will end up being the heart of this country, and when the country's in crisis, it'll be the farmers, who are close to the ground, and close to the earth, and close to reality, who are going to be the ones that save the nation.
[02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:11.169]  So I'm so proud of America's farmers, for a race, color, and creed, who are the heartland of this nation, and who understand that, hey, you try to intimidate me, you try to bully me, because our president stood up for our industry?
[02:19:11.829 --> 02:19:17.930]  We're ready to take it on the chin in this fight because we understand it's for a greater good.
[02:19:18.370 --> 02:19:26.091]  America had surrendered for 50 years to globalism and deindustrialization and 30 years selling our jobs out to China.
[02:19:26.431 --> 02:19:28.152]  And that surrender is open.
[02:19:28.932 --> 02:19:29.912]  But I'll say this to farmers.
[02:19:30.672 --> 02:19:31.612]  You think you're under attack?
[02:19:32.092 --> 02:19:33.393]  Infowars is under attack as well.
[02:19:33.433 --> 02:19:35.993]  And I notice that it's farming families that really support us.
[02:19:36.013 --> 02:19:37.053]  You're our strongest group.
[02:19:37.073 --> 02:19:39.494]  You understand that we're in the same position you're in.
[02:19:39.794 --> 02:19:40.814]  You think you've been sanctioned?
[02:19:41.594 --> 02:19:43.275]  They have unleashed hell on us, but you know what?
[02:19:43.575 --> 02:19:55.899]  We're still here because of you, so please, whether it's coffee, or toothpaste, or fish oil, or turmeric, we got great products at great prices at Infowarslife.com and Infowarsstore.com, and your financial support is what keeps us here as well.
[02:19:56.419 --> 02:19:57.919]  So, the globalists have sanctioned us.
[02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:02.181]  That's okay, because the farmers of America are standing with us, and we stand with you.
[02:20:06.282 --> 02:20:08.903]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:34.972 --> 02:20:38.015]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:38.035 --> 02:20:40.517]  Owen Schroer, Paul Joseph Watson with you.
[02:20:40.577 --> 02:20:42.219]  Just what an epic time to be alive.
[02:20:42.779 --> 02:20:45.341]  You almost just want Black Sabbath to tell the story, don't you?
[02:20:50.206 --> 02:20:52.968]  You can't even summarize it properly with vernacular.
[02:20:53.529 --> 02:20:54.329]  You need music.
[02:20:55.490 --> 02:20:56.131]  And horns.
[02:20:56.331 --> 02:20:57.372]  And passion.
[02:20:59.174 --> 02:21:00.195]  And just noise.
[02:21:01.667 --> 02:21:03.530]  That communicates universally with humans.
[02:21:03.971 --> 02:21:06.816]  No language can describe what's going on.
[02:21:07.457 --> 02:21:11.363]  But Paul Joseph Watson, look at this headline from the New York Times.
[02:21:11.383 --> 02:21:12.645]  Do you want to talk about irony?
[02:21:13.934 --> 02:21:23.360]  Epstein suicide conspiracies show how our information system is poisoned from Charlie Warzell, one of the biggest trash journalists out there, as you well know.
[02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:24.781]  But isn't this hilarious, Paul?
[02:21:25.061 --> 02:21:28.383]  The Epstein suicide shows how our information system is poisoned.
[02:21:28.764 --> 02:21:31.685]  Oh, not the lies about 9-11 to get us into war.
[02:21:31.766 --> 02:21:33.687]  Not the lies about the Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:21:33.907 --> 02:21:35.888]  Not the lies about weapons of mass destruction.
[02:21:36.128 --> 02:21:38.030]  Not the lies about babies in incubators.
[02:21:38.210 --> 02:21:39.731]  Not the lies about Russian collusion.
[02:21:40.131 --> 02:21:43.193]  Oh no, it's people that question the Epstein suicide
[02:21:43.513 --> 02:21:48.158]  That don't believe 1 plus 1 equals 3 from Charlie Warzell at the New York Times.
[02:21:48.178 --> 02:21:51.522]  I mean, what a pathetic puke Charlie Warzell is.
[02:21:51.562 --> 02:21:56.848]  But again, the irony to say that our information system is poisoned because people question an official narrative that doesn't make sense.
[02:21:57.428 --> 02:22:04.396]  When the New York Times spreads false information that leads us to war, boy, you could cut that irony with a dull knife, Paul.
[02:22:06.147 --> 02:22:29.848]  Well, we have to recall that the characterization of, quote, conspiracy theories as a dangerous assault, a fake news assault on reality, goes right back to George W. Bush, right after 9-11 and right before the invasion of Iraq, which of course, as we mentioned many times, is the biggest, most harmful fake news narrative that was pushed by the New York Times, above many others,
[02:22:30.672 --> 02:22:31.613]  The most harmful.
[02:22:31.973 --> 02:22:45.204]  It led to the invasion of Iraq, it led to the rise of ISIS, it led to the invasion of Libya, again based on a hoax to do with armed jihadists being peaceful revolutionary comrades that we had to go in there and support.
[02:22:45.948 --> 02:23:04.743]  The biggest, most harmful examples of fake news in terms of deaths, in terms of driving Christians out of entire countries and regions, in terms of the complete loss of faith in institutions in the West and in the United States, which by the way is leading the West towards a horrific civil war scenario that no one wants to see,
[02:23:05.323 --> 02:23:17.270]  But we are not responsible for that, for questioning Epstein or questioning any of the other of these highly questionable events when they literally launched the biggest fake news hoaxes, the most harmful, the most damaging.
[02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:21.712]  Whereas we were putting out articles like this weeks ago.
[02:23:22.132 --> 02:23:25.034]  Economist Jeffrey Epstein will be killed in jail.
[02:23:25.734 --> 02:23:26.154]  Another one.
[02:23:26.374 --> 02:23:31.237]  Epstein in danger of being murdered by powerful people before his trial, says victim's lawyer.
[02:23:32.063 --> 02:23:32.704]  Ann Coulter.
[02:23:32.844 --> 02:23:36.490]  Move Epstein to a Supermax prison before he is suicided.
[02:23:36.830 --> 02:23:45.002]  She made the point that there are people on death row in that New York correctional facility that will take a deal to be involved in a potential murder of Epstein.
[02:23:45.703 --> 02:23:46.704]  We predicted this.
[02:23:46.924 --> 02:23:48.846]  Numerous other prominent people predicted it.
[02:23:49.086 --> 02:23:50.728]  It happened exactly as predicted.
[02:23:51.108 --> 02:23:54.631]  Oh no, but we're dangerous simply because we got out ahead of the story.
[02:23:55.031 --> 02:24:04.860]  When again, they've been responsible for the most foundational, most harmful fake news stories in modern human history, yet they have the nerve to point the finger at us.
[02:24:05.941 --> 02:24:07.442]  Well this is like a weatherman.
[02:24:08.544 --> 02:24:21.530]  Or, like, there's a huge storm, like a huge hurricane is building out, you know, in the Atlantic Ocean, and so people are like, oh, hey, there's a huge hurricane that's about to hit the coast, and the Atlantic Coast, we better flee!
[02:24:22.674 --> 02:24:27.398]  And then Charlie Worzel goes on the TV and says, there's no hurricane coming, nothing to see here.
[02:24:27.498 --> 02:24:31.300]  And then the hurricane literally comes through and just like levels multiple cities.
[02:24:31.621 --> 02:24:38.386]  And then Charlie Worzel goes on air and says, there was a slight windstorm, barely any wind, no rain at all.
[02:24:38.446 --> 02:24:39.447]  And everyone's like, what?
[02:24:39.507 --> 02:24:41.748]  There's a massive hurricane that just leveled 10 cities.
[02:24:41.788 --> 02:24:42.769]  What the hell is this guy talking about?
[02:24:42.789 --> 02:24:46.372]  I mean, OK, Charlie Worzel, 1 plus 1 equals 3, doesn't it?
[02:24:46.632 --> 02:24:47.332]  At the New York Times.
[02:24:47.352 --> 02:24:48.734]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:24:48.754 --> 02:24:51.035]  But Paul, do you agree that this window of opportunity to
[02:24:52.532 --> 02:24:58.897]  Wake people up so that they can see mainstream media lies, they can see the cover-ups that are taking place, they can see the shadow government and the power it has.
[02:24:58.917 --> 02:25:12.286]  I mean, we're talking about... I mean, if Epstein was actually killed, I mean, we're talking about a shadow government here that has more power than a president, an attorney general, and an entire correctional facility combined.
[02:25:14.201 --> 02:25:20.183]  We're talking about a global elite that literally is run by paedophiles, Epstein not even being at the apex of it.
[02:25:20.203 --> 02:25:34.748]  We have to remember, you mentioned a video, Paedophiles Rule The World, which I made actually in 2017, over two years ago now, going through literally every major paedo-ring bust in every major European country, some in South America too.
[02:25:35.468 --> 02:25:43.595]  Every single time it leads back to the global political elite, to judges, to police chiefs, to people in the entertainment industry.
[02:25:43.915 --> 02:25:50.041]  The people they burn, people like Dutroux in Belgium, who got caught running a paedophile ring for the elite in Belgium.
[02:25:50.501 --> 02:25:55.585]  Every single time they burn the underling, the underling gets sent down or the underling gets killed.
[02:25:55.625 --> 02:25:57.447]  It's the same in every single country.
[02:25:57.787 --> 02:25:59.829]  So to come to that realisation,
[02:26:00.589 --> 02:26:08.134]  And the media plays these games where they're like, oh, Pizzagate disproves completely the fact that elites would be connected to pedophilia.
[02:26:08.154 --> 02:26:15.058]  No, they're connected to pedophilia in every single example, in every court case, in every country when any of this comes out.
[02:26:15.519 --> 02:26:17.340]  So it's about changing that narrative.
[02:26:17.660 --> 02:26:19.461]  It's about burning the underling.
[02:26:19.601 --> 02:26:20.782]  Epstein was the underling.
[02:26:21.242 --> 02:26:26.486]  Some speculation that he was working on behalf of a state actor as a blackmailing operation for them.
[02:26:27.316 --> 02:26:29.277]  So again, it's about burning the underlings.
[02:26:29.657 --> 02:26:35.520]  And just to get back to the nitty gritty of it, they literally put him in a straight jacket.
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:36.741]  This is what they do in this prison.
[02:26:36.781 --> 02:26:40.303]  They put you in a straight jacket where you can barely even move.
[02:26:40.803 --> 02:26:43.464]  They put you in there with a steel bed that's fixed to the floor.
[02:26:43.484 --> 02:26:44.785]  There's no light fixture.
[02:26:45.045 --> 02:26:45.905]  There are no bars.
[02:26:46.206 --> 02:26:47.586]  There are no instruments of death.
[02:26:47.626 --> 02:26:52.729]  The guy who was in there with Epstein at the same time said they give you rubber pens
[02:26:53.453 --> 02:26:56.014]  Because they fear you may hurt yourself with the pen.
[02:26:56.234 --> 02:27:00.695]  They literally have no instruments of death to carry out a suicide bid.
[02:27:00.735 --> 02:27:05.016]  Which is why they've had only one successful one in 21 years.
[02:27:05.396 --> 02:27:06.796]  All the others were prevented.
[02:27:07.076 --> 02:27:11.438]  You've got the highest profile sex trafficker billionaire pedo in there.
[02:27:11.678 --> 02:27:13.038]  The guy you want to watch the most.
[02:27:13.298 --> 02:27:16.899]  The guy who already allegedly tried to kill himself three weeks ago.
[02:27:17.668 --> 02:27:22.552]  They take all the surveillance off, they take all the guards off, and he suddenly winds out dead.
[02:27:22.853 --> 02:27:30.579]  And now the indictment, because it didn't name any individuals which came out last week, protects those individuals from being named.
[02:27:30.599 --> 02:27:36.164]  There are a lot more documents to come, but it does now look like that those individuals will be protected.
[02:27:36.444 --> 02:27:39.447]  So of course we're going to ask questions of this without being
[02:27:40.140 --> 02:27:49.257]  Finger-wagged at and called extremists and called conspiracy theorists and literally put in the same bracket as terrorists and mass shooters which is what the media is trying to do.
[02:27:49.955 --> 02:27:51.936]  You take Wazell, for example, Owen.
[02:27:52.436 --> 02:27:58.598]  He led the charge to de-platform Infowars and others based on nebulous accusations of hate speech.
[02:27:58.878 --> 02:28:06.521]  Now they're taking it to the next level where they say if you engage in fake news, if you circulate fake news, now you get de-platformed.
[02:28:06.561 --> 02:28:08.041]  Who decides what's fake news?
[02:28:08.621 --> 02:28:14.623]  The fake news media who are responsible for the biggest, most harmful examples of fake news in modern human history.
[02:28:14.663 --> 02:28:16.504]  It's a good little game they've got going, isn't it?
[02:28:17.765 --> 02:28:20.248]  Well, I mean, look, there's zero doubt.
[02:28:21.669 --> 02:28:23.571]  They did a stand-down order on Epstein.
[02:28:24.312 --> 02:28:27.355]  I don't know where the orders came from, but they obviously did a stand-down order.
[02:28:27.395 --> 02:28:30.718]  Now, you know, just, it's like, I wonder about a guy like Warzel.
[02:28:30.758 --> 02:28:35.143]  Doesn't it make you wonder about a guy like Warzel that tries to stand up and cover up mass pedophile networks?
[02:28:35.183 --> 02:28:36.304]  Doesn't it make you wonder about a Warzel?
[02:28:37.794 --> 02:28:39.315]  Makes you wonder.
[02:28:39.455 --> 02:28:49.581]  His friend over at CNN, Oliver Dorsey, again, another loser who was basically kicked out of the conservative movement, then had his revenge, his resentment, by de-platforming other conservatives.
[02:28:49.621 --> 02:28:49.921]  So, yeah.
[02:28:50.041 --> 02:28:51.182]  I mean, come on, Warzel!
[02:28:51.222 --> 02:28:52.943]  What is Charlie Warzel so afraid of?
[02:28:52.983 --> 02:28:54.584]  Like, did Epstein have dirt on him or something?
[02:28:54.624 --> 02:28:55.545]  I mean, come on, Warzel!
[02:28:55.985 --> 02:28:57.186]  1 plus 1 doesn't equal 3!
[02:28:57.226 --> 02:28:59.567]  1 plus 1 equals 2, Warzel!
[02:28:59.787 --> 02:29:00.688]  1 plus 1 does not equal 3!
[02:29:00.968 --> 02:29:02.048]  Why are you telling us it does?
[02:29:03.129 --> 02:29:14.492]  We just passed the August 6th one-year anniversary of the historic event where all of Big Tech working in concert banned InfoWars and Alex Jones off the internet.
[02:29:14.592 --> 02:29:18.573]  Well, Alex Jones has been banned from all tech platforms.
[02:29:18.673 --> 02:29:19.614]  Nobody said anything.
[02:29:19.654 --> 02:29:21.914]  So Big Tech's language police are getting bolder.
[02:29:21.954 --> 02:29:28.216]  Now four media giants are banding together to take down controversial InfoWars content from their site.
[02:29:28.396 --> 02:29:35.339]  YouTube, Facebook, and Apple all announcing they're removing his content from their platforms.
[02:29:35.519 --> 02:29:49.004]  But by the grace of God and via Matt Drudge's warning and others' warnings, we have helped build our own infrastructure, our own video, our own audio, our own news gathering system at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:29:49.344 --> 02:29:51.745]  And it's all because of your support.
[02:29:52.105 --> 02:29:53.146]  This is the house you built.
[02:29:53.706 --> 02:29:59.349]  I want to play a few minutes of just a sampling of the demonization and the lies of a year ago.
[02:29:59.789 --> 02:30:07.372]  And then I want to play a few minutes of what's happening currently as thousands and thousands of prominent people are completely banned and unpersoned as well.
[02:30:07.873 --> 02:30:10.114]  And as hundreds of millions of accounts
[02:30:10.914 --> 02:30:17.840]  Of people following popular meme sites and other sites on Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube are being deleted.
[02:30:18.341 --> 02:30:24.065]  That's hundreds of millions of followers not being able to choose what content they see.
[02:30:24.846 --> 02:30:25.647]  This is outrageous.
[02:30:26.267 --> 02:30:27.348]  That's incredibly dangerous.
[02:30:28.269 --> 02:30:29.810]  But it's the day and age that we live in.
[02:30:30.551 --> 02:30:34.955]  Thank God we built InfoWars so there'd be some voice in the midst of this.
[02:30:35.595 --> 02:30:37.897]  And that's why it's so important to remember before we play these clips that
[02:30:39.076 --> 02:30:43.078]  Without your word of mouth, and without you spreading the word, no one knows we're still here and still on air.
[02:30:43.419 --> 02:30:46.000]  Thanks to you doing that, we're coming back from the dead.
[02:30:46.961 --> 02:30:49.502]  And without your financial support, we won't be here either.
[02:30:49.963 --> 02:31:00.989]  So please check out the huge sales we have running, the Banniversary Sale, 50-60% off all the supplements, 50% off water filtration, air filtration, storable food, store-wide free shipping, and double Patriot Points, and a lot more.
[02:31:01.450 --> 02:31:03.771]  So be sure and visit InfoWareStore.com.
[02:31:04.131 --> 02:31:08.314]  Now let's go to the folks who tell us that we need to be banned, we need to be silenced, that we need to be shut down.
[02:31:08.974 --> 02:31:12.316]  And that, well, chief among those is yours truly, Alex Jones.
[02:31:12.756 --> 02:31:15.598]  Yesterday, Alex Jones became an un-person.
[02:31:15.798 --> 02:31:21.522]  Apple last night removed the entire library of Alex Jones' podcasts from their store.
[02:31:21.602 --> 02:31:28.025]  The conspiracy theories are beyond the realm, are not only beyond being offensive, they're dangerous.
[02:31:28.105 --> 02:31:37.511]  And we don't do enough in telling people out there right now this morning, people who read newspapers, exactly who these people are and what they believe.
[02:31:37.811 --> 02:31:38.831]  I want them shut down.
[02:31:38.891 --> 02:31:39.812]  I want them silenced.
[02:31:39.852 --> 02:31:40.652]  I want them muted.
[02:31:40.672 --> 02:31:42.513]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:31:42.573 --> 02:31:51.836]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[02:31:52.156 --> 02:31:59.758]  Even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform conservatives from the internet and communicating with each other.
[02:31:59.898 --> 02:32:01.038]  Just like communist China.
[02:32:01.138 --> 02:32:02.559]  And we're also standing up
[02:32:03.604 --> 02:32:06.305]  To social media censorship.
[02:32:06.345 --> 02:32:07.205]  That's the new thing.
[02:32:07.465 --> 02:32:13.687]  People at home could go and search, say, Alex Jones, a prominent InfoWars.com media broadcaster.
[02:32:13.887 --> 02:32:19.308]  If you go to DuckDuckGo or you go to Bing and you search Alex Jones, you'll find InfoWars in a mix of articles.
[02:32:19.708 --> 02:32:23.509]  If you go to Google, you won't even find his main broadcasting station, InfoWars.
[02:32:23.589 --> 02:32:25.750]  Instead, you'll just find a bunch of negative hit pieces.
[02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:31.493]  Conservatives are feeling the heavy hand of censorship in the United States and across Western Europe.
[02:32:31.593 --> 02:32:37.977]  Their social media accounts are being banned, blocked, and cancelled on Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook.
[02:32:38.097 --> 02:32:44.561]  And in 2020, you can bet that all of these companies are going to go all out.
[02:32:45.141 --> 02:32:48.904]  And the methods that they're using are invisible.
[02:32:48.984 --> 02:32:50.204]  They're subliminal.
[02:32:50.525 --> 02:32:52.506]  They're more powerful than...
[02:32:53.447 --> 02:33:08.909]  Most any effects I've ever seen in the behavioral sciences and I've been in the behavioral sciences for almost 40 years InfoWars tomorrow's news today You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[02:33:16.618 --> 02:33:21.763]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Owen Schroer.
[02:33:22.103 --> 02:33:24.945]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:39.710 --> 02:33:41.791]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:41.991 --> 02:33:44.311]  Owen Schroer filling in for Alex Jones today.
[02:33:44.331 --> 02:33:50.773]  Now, a lot of people listening might not even know this, even though it's been almost two years coming up, I believe.
[02:33:51.313 --> 02:33:55.495]  InfoWars is live ten hours a day now at InfoWars.com slash show.
[02:33:56.155 --> 02:33:57.875]  The David Knight Show, always informative.
[02:33:58.055 --> 02:33:59.276]  Mornings, 8 a.m.
[02:33:59.436 --> 02:34:00.596]  to 11 a.m.
[02:34:00.716 --> 02:34:01.116]  Central.
[02:34:01.436 --> 02:34:03.517]  Weekdays at InfoWars.com slash show.
[02:34:03.577 --> 02:34:06.158]  Of course, followed by the world famous
[02:34:07.518 --> 02:34:09.161]  Alex Jones Show, 11 a.m.
[02:34:09.181 --> 02:34:09.863]  to 3 p.m.
[02:34:10.123 --> 02:34:14.752]  Central weekdays, and then I normally host the War Room from 3 p.m.
[02:34:14.792 --> 02:34:15.934]  Central to 6 p.m.
[02:34:15.974 --> 02:34:19.881]  Central weekdays with a bunch of great guests and all the fun stuff we do there.
[02:34:22.284 --> 02:34:24.805]  And that's all at Infowars.com slash show.
[02:34:24.866 --> 02:34:26.586]  That's all in the midst of the censorship.
[02:34:26.647 --> 02:34:27.507]  I'm not allowed on YouTube.
[02:34:28.007 --> 02:34:34.391]  I'm not allowed to expand the work that I do and market on YouTube or Facebook or Twitter my show, The War Room.
[02:34:34.491 --> 02:34:35.892]  So it all comes down to word of mouth.
[02:34:35.952 --> 02:34:42.836]  It all comes down to you, the audience, telling friends and family about that broadcast, telling friends and family about Infowars.com slash show.
[02:34:42.876 --> 02:34:47.779]  And I'm telling you, I wish I could do a better job.
[02:34:50.310 --> 02:34:58.033]  Explaining this or vocalizing this, but... I always make sports analogies, so I'll just do that.
[02:34:59.453 --> 02:35:06.096]  Imagine you're... Uh, let's say a hockey player.
[02:35:07.956 --> 02:35:09.777]  And somebody has just passed you the puck.
[02:35:11.037 --> 02:35:15.239]  You get past the puck for a shot on net, say, ten times a game.
[02:35:16.459 --> 02:35:17.680]  And somebody just passed you the puck.
[02:35:18.547 --> 02:35:20.849]  And the goalie isn't even in the net.
[02:35:22.229 --> 02:35:25.472]  The goalie's way on the other side of his crease, not even on the net.
[02:35:26.192 --> 02:35:29.314]  And you've just got a wide open net to shoot at.
[02:35:30.014 --> 02:35:31.295]  All you gotta do is bury it.
[02:35:32.956 --> 02:35:34.898]  That's where we're at right now with the Sepstein story.
[02:35:35.418 --> 02:35:36.939]  Or imagine you're a football player.
[02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:39.881]  And you're running down the field.
[02:35:40.441 --> 02:35:42.443]  Normally you've got two defenders on you, tight.
[02:35:43.203 --> 02:35:45.725]  You're wide open, down the field, streaking down the sideline.
[02:35:45.805 --> 02:35:48.047]  All they gotta do is pass it to you, and it's a touchdown.
[02:35:48.767 --> 02:35:55.832]  Or imagine like a carnival game, where you have to throw the ball through the hole to win the prize.
[02:35:56.613 --> 02:35:59.595]  The hole's normally a foot big, and you gotta toss the football through the hole.
[02:35:59.615 --> 02:36:00.636]  It's about a foot big.
[02:36:01.196 --> 02:36:04.179]  Well, today the hole is 20 feet big.
[02:36:05.260 --> 02:36:06.961]  But you gotta throw the ball through it.
[02:36:08.573 --> 02:36:11.314]  Nobody is believing this official Epstein narrative.
[02:36:11.894 --> 02:36:13.814]  Nobody believes the suicide narrative.
[02:36:15.175 --> 02:36:17.195]  A lot of people haven't heard about Infowars.com.
[02:36:18.395 --> 02:36:20.756]  This is when we throw the ball through the window, you see?
[02:36:21.156 --> 02:36:23.057]  This is when we hit the wide-open receiver.
[02:36:23.577 --> 02:36:26.037]  This is when we score on a wide-open net.
[02:36:28.318 --> 02:36:30.778]  But you have to shoot the puck.
[02:36:30.958 --> 02:36:33.179]  You have to throw the ball.
[02:36:34.588 --> 02:36:39.470]  It's like, I believe it was either Michael Jordan or Wayne Gretzky said, you miss all the shots you don't take.
[02:36:39.550 --> 02:36:40.011]  Well, whatever.
[02:36:40.031 --> 02:36:43.772]  The point is, if you don't take this shot, we miss it!
[02:36:45.193 --> 02:36:46.794]  Huge window of opportunity right now.
[02:36:47.294 --> 02:36:52.957]  Nobody's buying the Epstein thing, and people don't know where to go to get the best coverage of it.
[02:36:54.502 --> 02:36:56.363]  So you have to tell them Infowars.com slash show.
[02:36:56.483 --> 02:36:57.444]  You hear people talking about it.
[02:36:57.464 --> 02:36:58.324]  You hear them not believing it.
[02:36:58.344 --> 02:37:00.185]  Say, hey, check out the Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:00.365 --> 02:37:01.226]  Check out David Knight.
[02:37:01.426 --> 02:37:02.687]  Check out the War Room Throwing Troyer.
[02:37:02.887 --> 02:37:04.068]  They've got the best guests.
[02:37:04.088 --> 02:37:05.128]  They've got the most details.
[02:37:05.148 --> 02:37:06.369]  They've been covering this for years.
[02:37:06.829 --> 02:37:10.251]  And then people go listen to us and they say, wow, that stuff makes some sense.
[02:37:11.192 --> 02:37:12.692]  And then they start looking to all the other stuff.
[02:37:12.893 --> 02:37:15.214]  And then they say, wow, why did they lie about this group over time?
[02:37:15.454 --> 02:37:17.535]  Why is this news organization censored everywhere?
[02:37:17.555 --> 02:37:22.018]  You know, it is a miracle by God.
[02:37:23.157 --> 02:37:24.357]  That we're even still on air.
[02:37:27.318 --> 02:37:30.198]  But we're still here, so please, tell your friends and family.
[02:37:31.399 --> 02:37:32.859]  Tell them about Infowars.com.
[02:37:32.879 --> 02:37:42.941]  Look, I just spent five minutes supposed to be plugging our products so that we could still exist, and I'm more obsessed with the truth and information getting out there to awaken the public.
[02:37:43.121 --> 02:37:44.881]  I'm just saying, just share the stuff, man!
[02:37:45.121 --> 02:37:45.741]  It's free!
[02:37:45.761 --> 02:37:48.122]  It's like the story I saw today.
[02:37:51.172 --> 02:37:53.014]  From deadline, U.S.
[02:37:53.074 --> 02:37:59.019]  pay TV subscriber loses more than triple to 1.5 million in quarter number two.
[02:37:59.079 --> 02:38:02.581]  So, nobody's paying for news anymore because it's no good.
[02:38:04.543 --> 02:38:05.824]  People don't believe the cable news.
[02:38:05.844 --> 02:38:07.726]  They don't want to pay for this crap anymore.
[02:38:09.107 --> 02:38:10.888]  Tell them about InfoWars.com slash show.
[02:38:11.269 --> 02:38:11.869]  Share the links.
[02:38:12.109 --> 02:38:13.030]  Tell them while we're banned.
[02:38:13.210 --> 02:38:14.892]  Tell them, hey, the best upstream coverage is here.
[02:38:14.932 --> 02:38:15.953]  It's just, I just know it.
[02:38:16.093 --> 02:38:16.313]  I mean,
[02:38:20.410 --> 02:38:25.005]  If we miss this window of opportunity, I don't know if there'll ever be a big one.
[02:38:25.366 --> 02:38:27.172]  And there probably will be, because God always provides.
[02:38:27.192 --> 02:38:27.433]  It's just...
[02:38:28.885 --> 02:38:35.569]  I just know the window's there, and I just know all we have to do is just, it's like, I mean, all you have to do is just throw the ball.
[02:38:35.609 --> 02:38:36.970]  It's an empty net in hockey.
[02:38:36.990 --> 02:38:39.432]  Just, just push the puck into the net.
[02:38:39.472 --> 02:38:40.853]  It's just, it's wide open.
[02:38:41.353 --> 02:38:47.437]  Nobody's believing the Epstein thing, and mainstream news is telling them it's, oh yeah, suicide, financier suicide.
[02:38:47.757 --> 02:38:51.139]  Financier, that's fake, and suicide, that's fake.
[02:38:51.379 --> 02:38:53.781]  And everybody knows it's fake, but they don't know where to go.
[02:38:56.246 --> 02:39:03.590]  So please, tell them about InfoWars.com and please always support us by shopping at InfoWarsStore.com where we have huge specials going.
[02:39:03.630 --> 02:39:04.871]  It's the final day.
[02:39:04.911 --> 02:39:06.452]  Now look, I blew it here.
[02:39:06.472 --> 02:39:09.234]  I was supposed to give out the phone number and take calls.
[02:39:14.717 --> 02:39:16.038]  Let's go ahead and just open up the phone lines.
[02:39:16.058 --> 02:39:16.518]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[02:39:16.538 --> 02:39:16.698]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:39:23.766 --> 02:39:26.588]  We're going to squeeze in, I swear, I'm going to squeeze in as many calls.
[02:39:26.628 --> 02:39:28.969]  Just be ready to get your point out in 60 seconds.
[02:39:29.629 --> 02:39:31.230]  And I'm going to just hammer calls in the next segment.
[02:39:31.270 --> 02:39:34.833]  But 60 seconds in the next segment and the one after that.
[02:39:35.233 --> 02:39:36.834]  Maybe some calls with Gerald Cilenti coming up.
[02:39:37.314 --> 02:39:39.495]  But let me just do this.
[02:39:41.316 --> 02:39:44.618]  Because I got so much news and I can't even get through it.
[02:39:45.139 --> 02:39:46.439]  But let me just pile right through news.
[02:39:46.459 --> 02:39:47.260]  I mean, it's all crazy.
[02:39:50.206 --> 02:39:51.747]  Ian Miles Chong shared this.
[02:39:51.767 --> 02:39:53.028]  These documents are public.
[02:39:53.048 --> 02:39:53.809]  They were shared.
[02:39:53.829 --> 02:39:54.229]  Leaked emails.
[02:40:14.397 --> 02:40:15.978]  I don't know how to explain it.
[02:40:16.038 --> 02:40:22.143]  Literally, like, I can't tell you how many times Alex used to talk about how Brock literally sends out the talking points to the mainstream media.
[02:40:23.764 --> 02:40:25.686]  We now have it in the emails!
[02:40:25.946 --> 02:40:27.547]  We already had it in the WikiLeaks!
[02:40:28.468 --> 02:40:31.090]  But it's just more and more and more and more!
[02:40:31.390 --> 02:40:32.992]  InfoWars has proven right.
[02:40:33.252 --> 02:40:34.112]  Next year's news today.
[02:40:34.152 --> 02:40:39.717]  So yes, David Brock is telling the media what to say about Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:40:41.021 --> 02:40:43.703]  Yeah, it's called Fake News.
[02:40:43.923 --> 02:40:44.584]  How about this one?
[02:40:45.685 --> 02:40:47.486]  Eric Spracklin shares this on Twitter.
[02:40:48.307 --> 02:40:56.433]  Google Trends now show Trump body count searches almost exclusively are coming from California, while Clinton body count are coming from across the United States.
[02:40:58.375 --> 02:41:00.857]  And he highlights how this shows how we need an electoral college.
[02:41:00.877 --> 02:41:05.881]  But the real thing is, it just shows you how controlled
[02:41:08.220 --> 02:41:15.122]  Google is, and Twitter is, when Clinton body count is like number one trend, and they try to say it's Trump body count.
[02:41:18.143 --> 02:41:21.245]  FBI can't hack into Dayton shooter Conor Betts' phone.
[02:41:21.265 --> 02:41:22.585]  Well, isn't that convenient?
[02:41:22.645 --> 02:41:24.726]  Talk about a load of crap.
[02:41:25.686 --> 02:41:27.707]  The FBI doesn't even need to hack into his phone.
[02:41:27.887 --> 02:41:28.947]  They're already in there.
[02:41:29.327 --> 02:41:32.448]  There's already back doors built into every piece of technology.
[02:41:32.648 --> 02:41:33.989]  It's called Vault 7 leaks.
[02:41:34.649 --> 02:41:36.710]  But they think the average American is so dumb.
[02:41:37.908 --> 02:41:40.149]  Oh yeah, the FBI couldn't get into Conor Betts' phone.
[02:41:40.429 --> 02:41:44.810]  Folks, they're telling you that because he was such an avowed leftist Antifa member, they don't want it to come out.
[02:41:47.151 --> 02:41:51.172]  Las Vegas neo-Nazi charged with plot to bomb gay club and synagogue.
[02:41:51.212 --> 02:41:52.773]  Now you may ask, wait a second.
[02:41:54.173 --> 02:41:59.195]  Las Vegas, this is from ABC News, Las Vegas neo-Nazis charged with plot to bomb gay club, synagogue.
[02:41:59.255 --> 02:42:01.555]  Why wouldn't the media be reporting this, making this a big deal?
[02:42:01.855 --> 02:42:02.235]  Why?
[02:42:02.796 --> 02:42:03.756]  Because he was a socialist.
[02:42:05.328 --> 02:42:05.688]  Mm-hmm.
[02:42:07.369 --> 02:42:07.929]  Mm-hmm.
[02:42:08.729 --> 02:42:09.970]  Part of the Nationalist Socialist Movement.
[02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:11.610]  So, it almost worked!
[02:42:12.030 --> 02:42:12.931]  It almost worked!
[02:42:12.951 --> 02:42:16.092]  Ooh, white nationalist, neo-Nazi, let's claim he just tried to bomb everybody.
[02:42:16.112 --> 02:42:17.132]  Oh, but he's a socialist?
[02:42:17.672 --> 02:42:18.553]  Not mainstream news.
[02:42:19.513 --> 02:42:20.033]  See how that works?
[02:42:22.414 --> 02:42:23.434]  Story from Zero Hedge.
[02:42:24.555 --> 02:42:27.776]  Actually, let's just do this one in the light of the last story.
[02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:34.605]  From Washington Post, federal judge awards $700,000 to former American University student targeted in neo-Nazi troll form.
[02:42:34.885 --> 02:42:41.691]  The funny thing is, this guy, Anglin, that is the one who got charged here, people claim I'm actually him.
[02:42:41.992 --> 02:42:44.454]  They literally think I had some sort of surgery to be this guy.
[02:42:44.494 --> 02:42:45.695]  Okay, is this now proof I'm not?
[02:42:46.175 --> 02:42:46.756]  But second of all,
[02:42:48.154 --> 02:42:51.796]  This woman gets $700,000 from a troll storm.
[02:42:52.316 --> 02:42:55.258]  Excuse me, we got totally banned off the internet!
[02:42:55.438 --> 02:42:56.619]  How much money do we get?
[02:42:56.679 --> 02:42:58.440]  How about like $700 million?
[02:42:58.700 --> 02:43:02.442]  I mean, literally!
[02:43:02.883 --> 02:43:04.324]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[02:43:04.604 --> 02:43:06.365]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer.
[02:43:06.705 --> 02:43:08.066]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[02:43:08.466 --> 02:43:09.347]  But I'll be honest with you.
[02:43:10.207 --> 02:43:14.570]  We run, during the breaks, a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[02:43:15.535 --> 02:43:17.197]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[02:43:17.417 --> 02:43:18.018]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[02:43:18.699 --> 02:43:19.439]  But here's the bottom line.
[02:43:20.461 --> 02:43:21.722]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[02:43:21.942 --> 02:43:24.363]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[02:43:24.643 --> 02:43:25.404]  I don't want them to win.
[02:43:25.784 --> 02:43:27.805]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[02:43:28.705 --> 02:43:31.487]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[02:43:31.827 --> 02:43:34.588]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[02:43:34.988 --> 02:43:38.730]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[02:43:38.770 --> 02:43:40.011]  These will change your life.
[02:43:40.351 --> 02:43:41.732]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[02:43:41.752 --> 02:43:43.473]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[02:43:43.773 --> 02:43:44.433]  Check it all out.
[02:43:44.453 --> 02:43:46.054]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[02:43:46.394 --> 02:43:48.015]  Be part of the second American revolution.
[02:43:48.195 --> 02:43:49.376]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[02:43:49.676 --> 02:43:50.837]  You get great products at the same time.
[02:43:51.137 --> 02:43:53.278]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[02:43:53.598 --> 02:43:55.559]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[02:43:55.779 --> 02:43:58.961]  Take action now and fund the InfoWar for your own future.
[02:44:03.363 --> 02:44:09.387]  The Democrats are making it no secret that they're trying to take away our freedom and they're trying to take away our flag.
[02:44:15.675 --> 02:44:17.576]  But we can't let them get away with it.
[02:44:18.097 --> 02:44:26.763]  That's why you need to go to Infowarestore.com right now and get yourself a limited edition Betsy Ross flag t-shirt, which is on sale for $17.76.
[02:44:26.963 --> 02:44:32.266]  You can also get the same Don't Tread on Me t-shirt that Chris Pratt was wearing.

[02:44:53.639 --> 02:44:57.961]  A flawless victory.
[02:45:02.771 --> 02:45:03.752]  This is not a drill.
[02:45:03.972 --> 02:45:06.133]  Everybody knows who Donald Trump is.
[02:45:06.333 --> 02:45:06.954]  Donald Trump.
[02:45:07.214 --> 02:45:07.794]  Donald Trump.
[02:45:07.994 --> 02:45:08.554]  Donald Trump.
[02:45:08.655 --> 02:45:10.496]  We have to let him know who we are.
[02:45:10.816 --> 02:45:17.440]  This has to be the party that's not afraid to say out loud, we're going to tax the hell out of the wealthy.
[02:45:17.700 --> 02:45:21.522]  Your estimated net worth is more than $65 million.
[02:45:21.942 --> 02:45:29.507]  That would make you subject to Senator Warren's proposed wealth tax on the assets of the richest 75,000 homes, households or so in the United States.
[02:45:29.727 --> 02:45:31.708]  And I'd like to finish talking about Eddie.
[02:45:32.128 --> 02:45:33.789]  The guy who has ALS.
[02:45:34.550 --> 02:45:35.330]  This isn't funny.
[02:45:35.350 --> 02:45:36.371]  It's not funny!
[02:45:36.451 --> 02:45:40.933]  The healthcare industry will be advertising tonight on this program.
[02:45:40.953 --> 02:45:41.494]  Thank you, Senator.
[02:45:42.014 --> 02:45:43.034]  Senator Warren, it's your turn.
[02:45:43.194 --> 02:45:44.355]  Oh, that's a big sponsor, isn't it?
[02:45:44.655 --> 02:45:45.656]  Or that whole class of drugs.
[02:45:45.676 --> 02:45:46.356]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:45:46.396 --> 02:45:48.057]  No, whoa, gotta cut that off, don't you?
[02:45:48.177 --> 02:45:52.720]  I think if we're gonna force Americans to make these radical changes, they're not gonna go along.
[02:45:52.740 --> 02:45:54.141]  You, uh, throw your hands up.
[02:45:54.301 --> 02:45:56.402]  But you, uh, you have an influence.
[02:45:56.702 --> 02:45:57.102]  Whoa-ho!
[02:45:57.122 --> 02:45:58.243]  I can do it!
[02:46:01.323 --> 02:46:03.045]  We're up here with makeup on our faces.
[02:46:03.326 --> 02:46:04.928]  And the thing about predators is this.
[02:46:05.128 --> 02:46:06.610]  And our rehearsed attack lines.
[02:46:06.770 --> 02:46:09.314]  They prey on people they perceive to be weak.
[02:46:09.614 --> 02:46:11.456]  Playing roles in this reality TV show.
[02:46:11.757 --> 02:46:15.201]  They prey on people they perceive to be vulnerable.
[02:46:15.482 --> 02:46:18.646]  It's one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our president.
[02:46:18.806 --> 02:46:20.667]  Predators are cowards.
[02:46:21.167 --> 02:46:22.728]  I am not afraid.
[02:46:23.169 --> 02:46:26.471]  And for Democrats to win, you can't be afraid either.
[02:46:26.571 --> 02:46:29.933]  We don't need a liberal or progressive with big ideas.
[02:46:30.193 --> 02:46:33.114]  We need a mass political movement.
[02:46:33.455 --> 02:46:38.277]  Or we don't need a moderate who can win back Trump-Obama voters.
[02:46:39.218 --> 02:46:42.939]  Progressive as anybody up on this stage, but I'm also pragmatic.
[02:46:43.239 --> 02:46:44.679]  You need someone who can do both.
[02:46:45.039 --> 02:46:47.719]  We have to walk and chew gum at the same time.
[02:46:48.260 --> 02:46:51.020]  I really do believe that we can walk and chew gum at the same time.
[02:46:51.300 --> 02:46:53.580]  We have to walk and chew gum at the same time.
[02:46:53.660 --> 02:46:55.301]  Go to Joe 30330.
[02:46:58.161 --> 02:47:00.022]  Let's end this three ring circus.
[02:47:00.462 --> 02:47:00.982]  Adios!
[02:47:05.722 --> 02:47:08.403]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:30.783 --> 02:47:32.324]  I hope we see the other side of this.
[02:47:32.704 --> 02:47:34.246]  I hope it's not just a light shining.
[02:47:35.106 --> 02:47:38.989]  Because we have a huge opportunity here to really expose the shadow government, folks.
[02:47:40.290 --> 02:47:41.531]  I got all this other news I want to get to.
[02:47:41.551 --> 02:47:44.213]  Let me put a bow on the end of what I was getting into.
[02:47:44.253 --> 02:47:45.494]  Then we're going to your calls, I promise.
[02:47:46.235 --> 02:47:54.601]  You've got this lady awarded $700,000 because an individual told people to target her for trolling on social media.
[02:47:54.641 --> 02:47:56.483]  She gets $700,000 for that?
[02:47:57.383 --> 02:48:08.492]  You've got people that threaten Alexandra Cortez on Facebook being investigated.
[02:48:09.522 --> 02:48:18.545]  And then, just to highlight all the hypocrisy, you know, over weekend in Chicago, 46 were shot, including an 8-year-old girl.
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:25.726]  You had a fire in Pennsylvania that killed five kids, and it could have been prevented with a smoke detector.
[02:48:25.746 --> 02:48:27.908]  But you notice, the media doesn't talk about that.
[02:48:27.988 --> 02:48:29.930]  I thought the media cared about stopping gun violence.
[02:48:30.030 --> 02:48:30.951]  Why don't they cover Chicago?
[02:48:31.171 --> 02:48:34.194]  I thought the media cared about unnecessary child death.
[02:48:34.455 --> 02:48:38.439]  Well, why don't they report on putting fire detectors and smoke detectors in your home?
[02:48:38.559 --> 02:48:39.540]  Because the media doesn't care.
[02:48:40.472 --> 02:48:42.232]  They only report on something when it's advantageous.
[02:48:42.252 --> 02:48:51.474]  But talk about a double standard here, where if you threaten AOC on Facebook, you get arrested, and if you have a troll farm that targets an individual, you pay $700,000 in fines.
[02:48:52.014 --> 02:48:54.535]  InfoWars got frickin' removed!
[02:48:54.695 --> 02:48:57.155]  Alex Jones got kicked off of social media!
[02:48:57.195 --> 02:49:00.316]  Where's our fine for targeted harassment?
[02:49:01.336 --> 02:49:03.337]  People go flag our stuff to get kicked off!
[02:49:03.497 --> 02:49:05.417]  Where's our fines for targeted harassment?
[02:49:06.616 --> 02:49:08.097]  People threaten us all the time.
[02:49:08.337 --> 02:49:09.557]  How come they don't get arrested?
[02:49:10.257 --> 02:49:11.198]  Sick of the double standards.
[02:49:11.218 --> 02:49:13.398]  And then they say, financier Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:49:13.539 --> 02:49:17.660]  So the mainstream media literally covers up for industrial-level pedophilia.
[02:49:18.760 --> 02:49:20.321]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:49:20.341 --> 02:49:22.342]  Let's go to George in New Mexico.
[02:49:22.402 --> 02:49:23.122]  Go ahead, George.
[02:49:24.222 --> 02:49:25.323]  Hey, what's up, Owen?
[02:49:25.943 --> 02:49:29.384]  Yeah, man, this is truly a tragic event, man.
[02:49:29.404 --> 02:49:34.126]  You know, there's so many questions unanswered that need to be answered around this.
[02:49:34.867 --> 02:49:37.088]  Mysterious death, you know, of Epstein.
[02:49:37.128 --> 02:49:45.151]  And it's just, it comes as no coincidence, just a day before, you know, the documents being unsealed.
[02:49:46.011 --> 02:49:51.993]  And, you know, all of a sudden we get this, this, you know, all the events leading up to it.
[02:49:52.013 --> 02:49:55.455]  It's just, there's like, why put on suicide watch?
[02:49:55.495 --> 02:50:01.797]  Was he, you know, he had made reports that he, you know, was actually attempted murder on his life.
[02:50:02.457 --> 02:50:04.158]  You know, not to mention the blackout
[02:50:04.611 --> 02:50:13.757]  That same exact night in Manhattan that occurred, you know, it's just like, it's totally like insidious.
[02:50:13.818 --> 02:50:17.720]  Just, you know, the whole, where's the footage of the cameras?
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:18.441]  Well, exactly.
[02:50:18.461 --> 02:50:18.861]  That's the thing.
[02:50:18.901 --> 02:50:22.404]  This is the most 1 plus 1 equals 3 narrative we've ever been sold ever.
[02:50:23.104 --> 02:50:23.304]  Ever.
[02:50:23.945 --> 02:50:25.446]  And again, it's not 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:50:25.566 --> 02:50:26.386]  That's a little more advanced.
[02:50:26.426 --> 02:50:27.547]  This is 1 plus 1 equals 2.
[02:50:27.867 --> 02:50:28.588]  Thanks for the call, George.
[02:50:28.608 --> 02:50:31.150]  So, yeah, I don't see anybody buying this.
[02:50:32.284 --> 02:50:38.629]  Look, the more I think, the more I look into it, it's clear there was a stand-down order given to stand down on Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:50:38.709 --> 02:50:43.093]  Now, whether that was given by good forces or bad forces, I don't know.
[02:50:43.273 --> 02:50:45.795]  But clearly, there was a stand-down order.
[02:50:47.036 --> 02:50:50.018]  Let's go now to William in Alaska.
[02:50:50.058 --> 02:50:50.679]  Go ahead, William.
[02:50:52.180 --> 02:50:52.840]  How's it going, Owen?
[02:50:53.101 --> 02:50:53.461]  Good, thank you.
[02:50:54.758 --> 02:51:00.119]  So, yeah, to get back on this Epstein thing, nobody's going to buy this at all.
[02:51:00.159 --> 02:51:02.620]  This is definitely a smelly pig.
[02:51:03.240 --> 02:51:04.720]  And again, we're not going to take this.
[02:51:04.800 --> 02:51:09.261]  We're tired of being told the same 2D narrative like you were talking about earlier.
[02:51:09.401 --> 02:51:13.022]  And like you just said, one plus, this is, we're not going to take it.
[02:51:13.382 --> 02:51:17.803]  And number two, the opportunity that we have right now is that nobody is buying this.
[02:51:18.403 --> 02:51:18.883]  Nobody.
[02:51:19.423 --> 02:51:22.244]  Nobody I know, even my wife was like, are you kidding me?
[02:51:23.024 --> 02:51:24.044]  Yes, here it is.
[02:51:25.037 --> 02:51:34.867]  And right after, again, the 302s, his documents being released, and even if he was or not killed or taken out or put under protection, why?
[02:51:35.568 --> 02:51:35.808]  Why?
[02:51:35.928 --> 02:51:41.674]  Why is there a two-tiered justice system for the equals or the elites and the elitists, for the people that are well-connected?
[02:51:42.234 --> 02:51:46.879]  If, you know, like Anthony Weiner, if I sexed with a 15-year-old right now, I'd have been arrested immediately.
[02:51:47.432 --> 02:51:50.934]  I don't get to go to some sex therapy camp in the middle of somewhere for a couple months.
[02:51:51.134 --> 02:51:52.755]  Well, here's what I don't understand, too.
[02:51:52.815 --> 02:51:54.616]  Thanks for the call again, folks.
[02:51:54.636 --> 02:51:55.396]  60 seconds, I'm jumping.
[02:51:55.696 --> 02:52:03.440]  But it's like... It just shows how the average American, and maybe it's worldwide, it's just the average person is just in such a trance.
[02:52:03.460 --> 02:52:08.443]  I mean, literally, people are crying over Miley Cyrus's relationship right now.
[02:52:09.123 --> 02:52:12.805]  And it's like... How brainwashed have you been?
[02:52:14.506 --> 02:52:15.627]  People are more... I mean, it's just...
[02:52:16.786 --> 02:52:20.869]  I just can't even imagine being that lost as a human, because... I'll just leave it there.
[02:52:21.350 --> 02:52:23.511]  Let's go to Frank, calling in from California.
[02:52:23.531 --> 02:52:24.012]  Go ahead, Frank.
[02:52:26.894 --> 02:52:29.756]  Alex Jones, he's our hero.
[02:52:30.197 --> 02:52:35.421]  Gonna reduce plastic bottle waste down to zero with Alexa.
[02:52:35.861 --> 02:52:41.886]  Pure command C. Just how great the conspiracy of clean water can be.
[02:52:42.587 --> 02:52:43.327]  Wow!
[02:52:45.054 --> 02:52:47.015]  You are the InfoWars!
[02:52:48.075 --> 02:52:49.996]  We salute you, Owen Troyer.
[02:52:50.696 --> 02:52:52.677]  Alex Jones and InfoWars crew.
[02:52:54.718 --> 02:52:55.618]  InfoWars!
[02:52:55.958 --> 02:52:57.319]  Next year's news today.
[02:52:57.339 --> 02:52:58.659]  Action Hero!
[02:52:59.460 --> 02:53:00.760]  Coming for Epstein.
[02:53:01.020 --> 02:53:03.041]  Getting the pedophile network shut down.
[02:53:03.341 --> 02:53:05.162]  New York Times says that's bad.
[02:53:06.663 --> 02:53:08.703]  So I guess Charlie Worzel likes pedophiles, huh?
[02:53:10.644 --> 02:53:11.505]  Pretty much, I guess.
[02:53:11.525 --> 02:53:12.285]  Something like that.
[02:53:13.732 --> 02:53:15.233]  Well, Frank, that was a beautiful rendition.
[02:53:15.253 --> 02:53:16.353]  Is there anything else you want to add?
[02:53:17.213 --> 02:53:18.094]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[02:53:18.114 --> 02:53:23.275]  I just know how you like those memeable moments, so I thought, you know, do a little plug for InfoWarsTore.
[02:53:23.596 --> 02:53:26.737]  Alex Jones is now the most credible man in news.
[02:53:28.437 --> 02:53:31.238]  But, yeah, I would like to just, you know, A.G.
[02:53:31.278 --> 02:53:33.199]  Barr, in my personal opinion, he's a joke.
[02:53:34.299 --> 02:53:36.140]  I think it's been discussed a number of times.
[02:53:36.180 --> 02:53:41.302]  He's just kind of the cleanup man there, kind of like you were talking about earlier about
[02:53:42.691 --> 02:53:48.895]  You know, All Right's daughter being there with the whole Russiagate deal.
[02:53:49.355 --> 02:53:51.737]  I mean, he really showed his cards appointing Durham.
[02:53:52.537 --> 02:53:53.818]  I mean, he was there.
[02:53:53.878 --> 02:53:59.981]  Durham was there with Mueller for the whole Whitey-Bolger deal.
[02:54:00.121 --> 02:54:03.603]  Well, and here's the thing about that, Frank, Greg called good points.
[02:54:04.724 --> 02:54:10.127]  This thing is so epic and so high up that you're going to have people flipping, essentially.
[02:54:11.901 --> 02:54:17.267]  Um, I don't even know if we can fully understand that yet, to be honest.
[02:54:17.307 --> 02:54:21.351]  I don't know if we ever will, but I mean, I really believe that things are that epic.
[02:54:21.371 --> 02:54:24.435]  I mean, there is a civil war happening, but it's at a very high...
[02:54:26.272 --> 02:54:37.214]  A shadowy political power structure, shadow government level that most people couldn't even comprehend and that we'll probably never see or hear about.
[02:54:38.154 --> 02:54:39.395]  But I really believe that's going on.
[02:54:39.435 --> 02:54:42.455]  So some of these names like Acosta and Barr, people are like, oh, Deep State, Deep State.
[02:54:42.475 --> 02:54:47.856]  Well, maybe, maybe they're operating in good faith now, but it's just so epic.
[02:54:47.896 --> 02:54:50.857]  How can you even measure any of it other than, hey, look at what just happened with Epstein?
[02:54:51.217 --> 02:54:54.338]  All right, let's take a call from, who do we have next?
[02:54:54.438 --> 02:54:55.358]  Jake in California.
[02:54:55.378 --> 02:54:55.838]  Go ahead, Jake.
[02:54:57.492 --> 02:54:58.532]  Hey, Owen.
[02:54:58.712 --> 02:55:02.993]  This is a little off the Epstein subject, but kind of dovetails into it.
[02:55:03.553 --> 02:55:06.794]  My brother is extremely well-educated.
[02:55:06.874 --> 02:55:16.056]  He was an Army Ranger, and he worked at the State Department, and then the FBI, and now he's, ironically, at a management position in Google.
[02:55:17.196 --> 02:55:22.917]  And I don't know what is up with him or how to go about this, but he's so intelligent
[02:55:23.664 --> 02:55:24.124]  I don't know.
[02:55:35.680 --> 02:55:42.083]  I don't want to insult him, but I've just, from my experience, what that normally is, is it's this elitism mentality.
[02:55:42.223 --> 02:55:43.984]  Like, oh, nobody could fool me.
[02:55:44.304 --> 02:55:45.384]  Oh, I was at Harvard.
[02:55:45.624 --> 02:55:46.285]  I'm the elite.
[02:55:46.525 --> 02:55:47.385]  I know everything.
[02:55:48.005 --> 02:55:50.727]  And so it's really a pride thing, more than anything.
[02:55:50.767 --> 02:55:51.947]  Again, I don't know about your brother.
[02:55:52.167 --> 02:55:55.789]  It's just, that's what I've noticed in kind of prideful elitists.
[02:55:55.809 --> 02:56:01.131]  I don't know if your brother's a liberal, but liberals, like, oh, I'm the, I, nobody can fool me.
[02:56:01.151 --> 02:56:02.892]  I'm part of the establishment.
[02:56:02.912 --> 02:56:04.893]  I mean, it's all just a big, it's all just a big facade.
[02:56:06.693 --> 02:56:10.815]  Yeah, I mean, and part of it is, is when everybody really started waking up.
[02:56:11.836 --> 02:56:16.398]  I mean, I accepted Christ a long time ago, and I credit that to my initial awakening.
[02:56:16.498 --> 02:56:29.325]  But in 16, I started really, you know, 15 or 2014, actually, and when I watched Hating Breitbart, and then I watched Endgame that Alex made.
[02:56:30.285 --> 02:56:31.486]  And then it just, you know, the whole
[02:56:31.954 --> 02:56:36.135]  The world just opened up to me from there, and the veil was completely torn from my eyes.
[02:56:36.455 --> 02:56:41.976]  And his wife is extremely liberal and just hates my guts.
[02:56:42.516 --> 02:56:49.898]  And so every time I try to say, hey, look at this on that, that on this, and he comes up with all these different... Well, exactly.
[02:56:49.938 --> 02:56:55.659]  And like I said, it's just a facade to maintain this elitism mentality, like you're in the know when you're not.
[02:56:55.919 --> 02:56:56.419]  Thanks for the call.
[02:56:56.439 --> 02:56:59.060]  Let's take one more quick call from Kim in Maine.
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:56:59.860]  Go ahead, Kim.
[02:57:00.819 --> 02:57:06.044]  Yeah, on that original thing where Epstein supposedly tried to commit suicide, there were scratches.
[02:57:06.664 --> 02:57:10.047]  You only get scratches if you're trying to remove a person's hands from your neck.
[02:57:10.968 --> 02:57:13.870]  Number two, you cannot choke yourself to death.
[02:57:14.291 --> 02:57:17.573]  You can choke yourself into unconsciousness, but not to death.
[02:57:17.733 --> 02:57:19.595]  Right, you can't try to stop breathing.
[02:57:19.715 --> 02:57:27.442]  Like I said, the only thing you can do, and I don't know with this situation, if there was like a metal wall he could bang his head against or something like that, but there was no signs of that.
[02:57:28.345 --> 02:57:32.046]  That proves that he was not suicidal because he was trying to keep himself alive.
[02:57:33.107 --> 02:57:33.627]  His inmate.
[02:57:34.047 --> 02:57:34.387]  No, no, no.
[02:57:35.047 --> 02:57:35.747]  I totally agree.
[02:57:35.767 --> 02:57:37.528]  There was clearly a stand-down given.
[02:57:38.048 --> 02:57:42.590]  The question is, was the stand-down from forces of good or forces of evil?
[02:57:43.430 --> 02:57:44.710]  I mean, there's no other way.
[02:57:44.850 --> 02:57:46.311]  One plus one does not equal three.
[02:57:46.391 --> 02:57:46.951]  We know that.
[02:57:47.051 --> 02:57:48.391]  Quit lying to us, MSN.
[02:57:48.611 --> 02:57:49.972]  Quit lying to us, New York Times.
[02:57:59.454 --> 02:58:12.978]  If you want to bet on your future, if you want to bet on Americana, if you want to bet on not being run by the shycoms, with Senate and House hearings now on how they literally fund the Democrats and MSM and CNN, the Chinese government does.
[02:58:13.038 --> 02:58:13.898]  It's all coming out.
[02:58:14.298 --> 02:58:15.199]  It's so devastating.
[02:58:15.279 --> 02:58:17.779]  And the government isn't even sure how to bring this out.
[02:58:17.999 --> 02:58:19.920]  They're starting to bring it out, going, Democrats, stop!
[02:58:20.060 --> 02:58:21.100]  Democrats aren't going to stop.
[02:58:21.140 --> 02:58:22.561]  They're trying to cause a civil war right now.
[02:58:22.581 --> 02:58:23.802]  They're starting to get some purchase.
[02:58:23.962 --> 02:58:24.702]  Trying to start a fire?
[02:58:24.742 --> 02:58:25.663]  They got some fire going.
[02:58:25.763 --> 02:58:30.285]  All the physical attacks, shootings, bombings, ICE facilities getting attacked, dead people everywhere.
[02:58:30.305 --> 02:58:31.265]  It's on, folks.
[02:58:31.545 --> 02:58:34.967]  And if you think it's bad now, if they really get traction, it's going to go insane.
[02:58:35.067 --> 02:58:41.610]  So now more than you've ever done, for yourself, for me, for everybody, spread the word about this broadcast on your local station, radio, TV.
[02:58:41.690 --> 02:58:43.771]  Tell folks about it at pollworkers.com forward slash show.
[02:58:43.951 --> 02:58:49.296]  And let them know, hey, they wanted to shut this guy down because he exposed the Chinese government funding and controlling Hollywood.
[02:58:49.336 --> 02:58:50.977]  You wonder why Hollywood's anti-American?
[02:58:51.177 --> 02:58:53.919]  It's literally owned by the Chinese military.
[02:58:54.160 --> 02:58:55.741]  UT's basically run by China now.
[02:58:55.921 --> 02:58:56.642]  It's unbelievable.
[02:58:56.662 --> 02:58:58.563]  It's all coming out in Senate and House reports.
[02:58:58.683 --> 02:59:00.305]  But listen, everybody else is scared.
[02:59:00.725 --> 02:59:02.627]  Everybody else ran for the exits a long time ago.
[02:59:02.987 --> 02:59:11.098]  We knew if we told the truth, bet on you, you'd stand up, you'd see what happened, good people in government would see what happened, and that we would finally get people to take action.
[02:59:11.118 --> 02:59:14.703]  But somebody's got to make that first example, so I am honored to be in the position.
[02:59:15.822 --> 02:59:19.885]  I've had the enemy trying to destroy me right now, and the threats and all of it.
[02:59:20.225 --> 02:59:21.566]  It just makes me so alive.
[02:59:21.606 --> 02:59:24.468]  It's amazing, and I am very thankful to God for putting me in this position.
[02:59:24.768 --> 02:59:29.411]  With that said, I want to fight hard, and I need you to buy the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:59:29.451 --> 02:59:36.835]  Huge sale, the one-year anniversary banning sale, the ban-niversary sale, 50-60% off, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points.

[02:59:39.517 --> 02:59:46.923]  Not just the Second American Revolution, but a pro-human future against the devil-worshipping Satanists and their off-world controllers.
[02:59:56.330 --> 02:59:59.993]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:00:05.587 --> 03:00:11.692]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:00:12.173 --> 03:00:14.735]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:00:14.795 --> 03:00:22.942]  You know, we got a lot of names from the documents and the victim testimony, people involved with Epstein.
[03:00:22.962 --> 03:00:26.685]  I wonder, what were they up to the day that Epstein died?
[03:00:45.612 --> 03:00:59.860]  Less than 24 hours after unsealed court documents revealed that several politicians, including Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew of the Royal Family, were implicated in the pedophile scandal of Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:01:00.761 --> 03:01:05.804]  Epstein dies in his jail cell while on 24-hour suicide watch.
[03:01:07.925 --> 03:01:11.247]  There was a camera malfunction during his alleged suicide.
[03:01:12.608 --> 03:01:19.092]  And a pathologist connected to the JFK investigation was chosen to conduct the autopsy.
[03:01:20.433 --> 03:01:25.357]  For most of the world, the death of Jeffrey Epstein was a grave injustice.
[03:01:26.738 --> 03:01:33.042]  But for many of those implicated in the recently unsealed documents, it was a cause for celebration.
[03:01:34.183 --> 03:01:41.688]  Several Democrats and Republicans partied in Israel, home of the Mossad, which seems to be at the heart of the Epstein scandal.
[03:01:43.407 --> 03:01:47.929]  Bill and Hillary Clinton were out smiling for the cameras in Illinois.
[03:01:51.390 --> 03:01:57.493]  While kisses and hugs, Hillary and Bill was scrawled outside of Epstein's Manhattan estate.
[03:02:00.374 --> 03:02:04.856]  And the Queen of England had a lovely day with jubilant Prince Andrew.
[03:02:06.616 --> 03:02:07.977]  Nothing to see here, folks.
[03:02:09.338 --> 03:02:10.258]  Go back to sleep.
[03:02:11.892 --> 03:02:13.432]  There is no conspiracy.
[03:02:14.473 --> 03:02:19.454]  Let old acquaintances be forgotten and never brought to mind.
[03:02:19.634 --> 03:02:32.678]  Really gotta wonder why anybody in media wouldn't be questioning the official narrative.
[03:02:34.038 --> 03:02:35.398]  We can make assumptions, but we won't.
[03:02:35.939 --> 03:02:37.539]  We'll just ask why.
[03:02:39.827 --> 03:02:43.209]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[03:02:43.830 --> 03:02:49.313]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's go back to the phone lines and go to Grant in Iowa.
[03:02:49.353 --> 03:02:50.074]  Go ahead, Grant.
[03:02:52.235 --> 03:02:52.756]  Hey, Alex.
[03:02:53.596 --> 03:02:53.736]  Hi.
[03:02:53.756 --> 03:03:08.646]  Just wanted to point out kind of the coincidence of, you know, them doing this bait-and-switch or whatever on early Saturday morning, which gives the lying mainstream media two days to run their BS narrative.
[03:03:09.275 --> 03:03:16.121]  And it'll be interesting to see what, like, Tucker says tonight about it, if he's even allowed to tell anyone.
[03:03:16.922 --> 03:03:18.343]  My friend sent me this thing off Reddit, too.
[03:03:18.403 --> 03:03:20.045]  It's a quick little text I wanted you to read.
[03:03:20.085 --> 03:03:24.989]  It's one of the workers from the facility where he's being kept.
[03:03:26.411 --> 03:03:28.553]  So he says, quote, not saying anything after this.
[03:03:28.633 --> 03:03:29.814]  Please do not try to dox me.
[03:03:30.410 --> 03:03:34.452]  But last night, after 415 count, they took him medical in a wheelchair.
[03:03:34.472 --> 03:03:34.893]  Yeah, right.
[03:03:35.093 --> 03:03:35.513]  I saw that.
[03:03:35.533 --> 03:03:36.474]  It's an anonymous post.
[03:03:36.534 --> 03:03:40.176]  I really don't want to put too much credence into that because it's an anonymous post and who has any idea.
[03:03:40.236 --> 03:03:41.557]  But basically, it's the same thing.
[03:03:41.597 --> 03:03:42.337]  It's common sense.
[03:03:42.417 --> 03:03:47.520]  There was clearly a stand-down given to get Epstein out or kill him.
[03:03:47.920 --> 03:03:49.962]  Was it from forces of good or forces of evil?
[03:03:49.982 --> 03:03:50.762]  Thanks for the call, Grant.
[03:03:51.162 --> 03:03:53.824]  Let's squeeze one more call in here before Gerald Salenti takes over.
[03:03:53.844 --> 03:03:56.646]  Let's go to David calling in from Massachusetts.
[03:03:56.666 --> 03:03:57.186]  Go ahead, David.
[03:03:58.928 --> 03:04:00.049]  How you doing, Owen?
[03:04:00.089 --> 03:04:02.571]  I got something that nobody's thinking about right now.
[03:04:02.631 --> 03:04:08.596]  Now, the Democrats, they don't like when school kids go on summer vacation because they can't stay in school shooting.
[03:04:09.217 --> 03:04:18.745]  Now, my kids are going back to school in about two weeks, and I believe that they're warming up some school shootings, and they're going to blame it on Infowars, and they're going to blame it on President Trump.
[03:04:18.765 --> 03:04:19.706]  What do you think about that?
[03:04:19.986 --> 03:04:20.887]  Well, they're already doing it.
[03:04:21.886 --> 03:04:23.689]  I mean, they literally are already doing that.
[03:04:24.029 --> 03:04:29.838]  I mean, they tried to scrub the whole El Paso shooter's history and make him out to be conservative.
[03:04:30.279 --> 03:04:33.664]  So they are literally engaging in this as we speak.
[03:04:35.868 --> 03:04:37.148]  I haven't heard anything about it.
[03:04:37.208 --> 03:04:42.869]  I mean, I heard about what you're talking about, but I didn't know they were doing it right now.
[03:04:42.929 --> 03:04:45.010]  The FBI, David, listen to this.
[03:04:45.230 --> 03:04:56.152]  The FBI won't even go in to the Dayton, Ohio shooter's phone or anything because they know he was a total leftist Antifa member.
[03:04:56.932 --> 03:04:59.032]  The narrative is supposed to be Trump bad.
[03:04:59.433 --> 03:05:00.213]  They're the bad guys.
[03:05:00.333 --> 03:05:01.313]  Antifa's the bad guys.
[03:05:04.915 --> 03:05:08.523]  Well, today, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[03:05:09.204 --> 03:05:14.075]  I just devoured your cousin, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[03:05:35.441 --> 03:05:39.682]  What the hell's going on here?
[03:06:13.454 --> 03:06:16.155]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:06:16.655 --> 03:06:21.496]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[03:06:22.796 --> 03:06:29.917]  That's right, and I'm about to hand it over to Gerald Salenti from the Trends Research Journal, who is in his best boogie suit today.
[03:06:30.137 --> 03:06:36.359]  So that means he's on Super Mill Vitality, and he's gonna be boogieing with you for the final hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:36.379 --> 03:06:39.319]  But first, I'm gonna throw a bunch of bouncing balls into his ring.
[03:06:39.499 --> 03:06:41.460]  Obviously, the Epstein ball is still bouncing around.
[03:06:42.280 --> 03:06:42.900]  But you've got...
[03:06:44.039 --> 03:06:53.602]  Uh, Monsanto right now trying to bully people out of, uh, telling the truth about them and what their products have done causing people cancer and all the lawsuits they've covered up.
[03:06:54.182 --> 03:06:59.903]  Uh, CNN profiled an illegal immigrant, um, you know, claiming, oh, he's the best, how dare, it's so sympathetic.
[03:06:59.943 --> 03:07:02.324]  And then that guy ended up killing a man driving without a license.
[03:07:03.464 --> 03:07:05.766]  Hillary Clinton is fundraising for illegal immigrants.
[03:07:07.027 --> 03:07:09.109]  Now this stuff is more right into Gerald's wheelhouse.
[03:07:09.129 --> 03:07:14.273]  You had Bank of America raising the chance of recession to 1 in 3 in the next 12 months.
[03:07:14.293 --> 03:07:14.934]  Gerald says it's 100%.
[03:07:16.875 --> 03:07:20.558]  Bankruptcy filings rising across the country could get worse.
[03:07:20.639 --> 03:07:29.085]  Most of these are in Democratic cities, big cities where people... Because here's the thing, the business goes bankrupt, no individual suffers except the workers that don't get paid.
[03:07:30.066 --> 03:07:30.767]  And then you've got
[03:07:32.683 --> 03:07:40.289]  A couple developments happening across the nation that are very important that I think Gerald may be able to highlight here.
[03:07:40.749 --> 03:07:42.651]  But again, I'm just throwing these bouncing balls in his arena.
[03:07:42.691 --> 03:07:43.912]  He can take them wherever they want.
[03:07:43.932 --> 03:07:47.414]  You just had a changing of the guard in Guatemala.
[03:07:47.915 --> 03:07:51.197]  Guatemalan election winner sets sights on changing Trump migration deal.
[03:07:51.217 --> 03:07:51.958]  This is huge.
[03:07:52.918 --> 03:08:06.304]  The new presidential elect Alejandro Guillemate is not going to work with Trump like the old leadership has been, where they're flying, they're deporting people back to Guatemala, they're stopping people on this caravan in Guatemala.
[03:08:07.165 --> 03:08:09.946]  That's why the immigration numbers were going down and we were finally deporting.
[03:08:10.266 --> 03:08:11.707]  The new president looks like he's not going to do that.
[03:08:11.827 --> 03:08:18.090]  And then, Argentine election, surprise, triggers crash in peso and bond sell-off.
[03:08:18.950 --> 03:08:20.711]  So I really wanted to get
[03:08:22.301 --> 03:08:33.190]  Gerald's take on Mauricio Macri, the new president of Argentina, and what this election means.
[03:08:33.250 --> 03:08:34.932]  Gerald Salenti, take it over.
[03:08:36.153 --> 03:08:36.833]  Thank you, Owen.
[03:08:37.153 --> 03:08:43.659]  I want to pick up first where you left off with Epstein.
[03:08:44.279 --> 03:08:50.144]  This is the story in today's Wall Street Journal.
[03:08:51.809 --> 03:08:56.792]  Conspiracy theories fly online over Epstein's death.
[03:08:57.833 --> 03:09:16.204]  The death of Jeffrey Epstein set off a wave of conspiracy theories online that demonstrate both how social media fuels misinformation and threatens to erode public acceptance of the results of any investigation.
[03:09:16.864 --> 03:09:20.787]  I can't use the word, but it's BS, what they're saying here.
[03:09:21.494 --> 03:09:22.895]  Conspiracy theory?
[03:09:23.295 --> 03:09:27.838]  How about a conspiracy theory that the cat killed himself?
[03:09:28.198 --> 03:09:30.520]  Could that be a conspiracy theory?
[03:09:31.400 --> 03:09:47.790]  I'd like you to play a clip that we did on two weeks ago, at the end of July, talking about what would happen with Epstein and the people that would hire the mob to get him out.
[03:09:47.890 --> 03:09:49.331]  So if you could play that right now.
[03:09:50.353 --> 03:10:16.477]  Like this guy, Jeffrey Epstein, built a fortune of more than a half billion dollars, leveraging unusually close relationships with a powerful small group of rich individuals over four decades, hanging out in the club with all the other sickos in that kind of club.
[03:10:20.151 --> 03:10:22.173]  Yeah, there's rumors that they're gonna kill this guy.
[03:10:22.894 --> 03:10:23.614]  You know, all this stuff.
[03:10:28.319 --> 03:10:28.859]  There you got it.
[03:10:30.001 --> 03:10:31.342]  The rumors are that they're gonna kill this guy.
[03:10:31.562 --> 03:10:33.144]  Gerald, Gerald, you're taking over here.
[03:10:33.184 --> 03:10:40.411]  It's just so funny because I almost want to go grab the clip, the crew may be able to find it, of Joe Biggs and I on Friday saying the exact same thing.
[03:10:40.711 --> 03:10:42.373]  Everybody knew it was coming, Gerald!
[03:10:43.311 --> 03:10:44.452]  This is two weeks ago.
[03:10:44.872 --> 03:10:46.114]  Conspiracy theory?
[03:10:46.394 --> 03:10:52.759]  How about this, you little slimers out there that are telling us, quote, that we have to accept.
[03:10:53.080 --> 03:10:57.524]  We're eroding public acceptance of the BS they're shoving down our throat.
[03:10:57.824 --> 03:11:00.927]  To me, it's conspiracy theory that the cat killed himself.
[03:11:01.567 --> 03:11:03.048]  I mean, this is such BS.
[03:11:04.350 --> 03:11:06.031]  They slaughtered the guy.
[03:11:06.051 --> 03:11:09.174]  You don't screw with the Clintons and the mob.
[03:11:09.938 --> 03:11:12.099]  This thing was going to turn, you know what was going to happen?
[03:11:12.119 --> 03:11:13.900]  They were going to give him a deal.
[03:11:13.920 --> 03:11:15.720]  That was going to happen.
[03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:17.861]  And he was going to spill the beans.
[03:11:18.501 --> 03:11:21.983]  And before he spilled the beans, they got rid of him.
[03:11:22.563 --> 03:11:26.704]  It's a conspiracy theory to believe this guy killed himself to me.
[03:11:27.085 --> 03:11:28.045]  But here's the deal.
[03:11:28.829 --> 03:11:35.493]  They should be banning the mainstream news for selling the conspiracy theory that he killed himself.
[03:11:35.874 --> 03:11:40.297]  We're supposed to swallow the crap that they keep shoving down our throat?
[03:11:40.537 --> 03:11:42.058]  Let me tell you something, Owen.
[03:11:42.378 --> 03:11:48.042]  That guy Saddam Hussein, he has weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al-Qaeda.
[03:11:48.282 --> 03:11:49.343]  You don't believe me?
[03:11:49.763 --> 03:11:55.627]  You don't believe that I'm a lying little piece of low-life crap named George W. Bush?
[03:11:56.187 --> 03:12:00.230]  And wolfish shits and penis Cheney and all the rest of them?
[03:12:01.011 --> 03:12:02.873]  No, you swallow that crap!
[03:12:03.313 --> 03:12:14.822]  That, if you don't, then you are guilty of eroding public acceptance of the BS they're shoving down our throat.
[03:12:15.163 --> 03:12:16.984]  This guy was wiped out.
[03:12:17.705 --> 03:12:20.567]  And I resent the people that call it a mafia.
[03:12:20.947 --> 03:12:22.709]  That's a hit on the Italians.
[03:12:23.323 --> 03:12:25.064]  This is bigger than a mafia!
[03:12:25.084 --> 03:12:27.845]  This is the Washington murderers!
[03:12:28.385 --> 03:12:31.147]  The Barack Obamas that slaughter people!
[03:12:31.167 --> 03:12:33.028]  You know, I don't like that guy Qaddafi!
[03:12:33.068 --> 03:12:34.308]  I want him outta there!
[03:12:34.328 --> 03:12:36.229]  I don't like that guy Assad!
[03:12:36.269 --> 03:12:37.390]  I don't care who you kill!
[03:12:37.710 --> 03:12:39.271]  I want him outta there!
[03:12:39.811 --> 03:12:40.911]  Bill Clinton!
[03:12:41.592 --> 03:12:41.992]  Bush!
[03:12:42.352 --> 03:12:44.133]  One murderer after another!
[03:12:44.613 --> 03:12:47.875]  They wipe this guy out because all the dirt... Oh!
[03:12:48.215 --> 03:12:49.976]  The Duke of Windsor!
[03:12:50.036 --> 03:12:50.456]  Yeah!
[03:12:51.576 --> 03:12:52.316]  You got it.
[03:12:52.756 --> 03:12:54.057]  The mob took him out.
[03:12:54.417 --> 03:12:57.598]  The mob of the elite that steal all our money.
[03:12:57.678 --> 03:12:59.778]  Honestly, Gerald, there's not even a term for this.
[03:12:59.819 --> 03:13:00.559]  This is so big.
[03:13:00.679 --> 03:13:02.899]  Again, the victims knew they were going to kill him.
[03:13:03.079 --> 03:13:04.620]  The lawyers knew they were going to kill him.
[03:13:04.800 --> 03:13:06.300]  Gerald Cilenti knew they were going to kill him.
[03:13:06.320 --> 03:13:08.581]  I'm going to play the clip of me and Joe Biggs saying they're going to kill him.
[03:13:08.601 --> 03:13:09.461]  Everyone in the world knew.
[03:13:09.741 --> 03:13:10.902]  Clearly a stand-down order.
[03:13:11.182 --> 03:13:12.722]  Who gave the stand-down order?
[03:13:12.962 --> 03:13:13.783]  That's what we need to know.
[03:13:13.803 --> 03:13:14.623]  Here's Joe Biggs.
[03:13:14.723 --> 03:13:15.843]  You just played the clip, Gerald.
[03:13:15.883 --> 03:13:19.604]  We should do this more often because we're all... You just heard Gerald Cilenti predicting they would kill him.
[03:13:19.644 --> 03:13:21.145]  Here's Joe Biggs and I last Friday.
[03:13:22.679 --> 03:13:25.201]  Hours before he died predicting it.
[03:13:26.462 --> 03:13:31.686]  Huge treasure trove of Jeffrey Epstein documents come out.
[03:13:31.846 --> 03:13:34.188]  All the names of the people.
[03:13:35.782 --> 03:13:36.823]  It was just incredible.
[03:13:37.483 --> 03:13:48.212]  It was basically one or two degrees of separation from either the Clintons or directly the Democrat Party or huge donors of the Democrat Party or a big part of the media.
[03:13:48.272 --> 03:13:50.594]  I mean, every single one.
[03:13:50.674 --> 03:13:53.376]  So, I mean, Joe, what do you make of all of this?
[03:13:53.396 --> 03:13:58.460]  I mean, we talked about, you know, you said Epstein's probably going to shoot himself three times in the head in jail.
[03:13:59.403 --> 03:14:01.384]  I mean, we've been talking about Epstein for years.
[03:14:02.004 --> 03:14:03.364]  Connections with the Clintons and all that.
[03:14:03.484 --> 03:14:09.506]  But I never thought, you know, in a million years we would see him be arrested and get to this point.
[03:14:09.866 --> 03:14:19.148]  But I think they've gotten so scared of him because of the information he has, what better way to control him than have him in that prison where they can sit there and scare the living crap out of him all the time.
[03:14:20.168 --> 03:14:26.490]  And it's only going to be a matter of time, like I said, you know, joking that he shoots himself three times in the head, you know, while he's in prison.
[03:14:27.472 --> 03:14:29.693]  You know, they don't want that kind of information, you know.
[03:14:29.793 --> 03:14:33.155]  That's gonna bring down the whole... That brings down the Titanic.
[03:14:33.195 --> 03:14:34.295]  That's the iceberg right there.
[03:14:34.575 --> 03:14:35.536]  He needs to be out of prison.
[03:14:35.576 --> 03:14:37.476]  Like, Trump needs to get him moved somewhere else.
[03:14:38.137 --> 03:14:39.337]  You need that bird singing.
[03:14:39.958 --> 03:14:41.078]  Well, that was a crazy thing, too.
[03:14:41.118 --> 03:14:42.919]  How do you not have... He's in New York, you know?
[03:14:42.939 --> 03:14:43.979]  Isn't that where he's in jail at?
[03:14:44.039 --> 03:14:44.440]  New York?
[03:14:44.840 --> 03:14:50.762]  How do you not have him so under surveillance that he could even be coming close to death like that?
[03:14:50.802 --> 03:14:52.263]  I mean, we still don't know what really happened.
[03:14:52.343 --> 03:14:53.184]  That's what I'm saying, though.
[03:14:53.224 --> 03:14:53.984]  He's in New York, though.
[03:14:55.489 --> 03:14:59.377]  I mean, he's in there with the dirty cop who is obviously running probably a big cocaine ring.
[03:15:01.058 --> 03:15:01.478]  I don't know.
[03:15:01.518 --> 03:15:05.421]  I think if Trump wants to really expose these people, that's what he needs to do.
[03:15:05.441 --> 03:15:06.161]  He needs to move him.
[03:15:06.201 --> 03:15:08.883]  He doesn't need to, we don't need to wake up one day and hear that Epstein was killed.
[03:15:09.343 --> 03:15:10.724]  That can happen after he sings.
[03:15:10.904 --> 03:15:12.765]  Now that was literally Friday.
[03:15:12.845 --> 03:15:14.266]  That was literally Friday.
[03:15:14.286 --> 03:15:18.829]  So listen, we played Gerald Cilenti predicting Epstein would die on InfoWars.
[03:15:19.009 --> 03:15:22.711]  You just heard me and Joe Biggs predicting he would die less than 24 hours before he did it.
[03:15:22.891 --> 03:15:23.972]  And then what do they do, Gerald?
[03:15:24.152 --> 03:15:27.394]  They ban us off everything and they say we're fake news!
[03:15:28.735 --> 03:15:28.955]  I know.
[03:15:30.356 --> 03:15:31.777]  Alright, I'm handing over the baton.
[03:15:31.837 --> 03:15:32.617]  I'm going to get out of the seat.
[03:15:32.637 --> 03:15:33.657]  I'm a loud mouth and I'm yelling.
[03:15:33.677 --> 03:15:34.758]  Gerald Salenti's the expert.
[03:15:34.778 --> 03:15:37.238]  He's got a lot to say, but Gerald, this is just, this is unbelievable.
[03:15:37.439 --> 03:15:39.819]  We have such an opportunity to awaken America right now.
[03:15:39.899 --> 03:15:41.660]  The window of opportunity is now.
[03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:43.521]  Throw the ball through the window.
[03:15:43.841 --> 03:15:44.901]  We've got an empty net.
[03:15:45.381 --> 03:15:46.542]  Push the puck into the net.
[03:15:46.642 --> 03:15:47.762]  It's game over, folks.
[03:15:48.362 --> 03:15:51.263]  Somebody murdered Jeffrey Epstein and the media's lying about it.
[03:15:51.443 --> 03:15:53.644]  They think the average IQ is 10 in this country.
[03:15:53.704 --> 03:15:54.184]  It's not.
[03:15:54.565 --> 03:15:58.186]  Tell people the media is covering up for Jeffrey Epstein's murder.
[03:16:08.204 --> 03:16:11.471]  Ladies and gentlemen, World War 4 is upon us.
[03:16:16.135 --> 03:16:17.015]  It's a proxy war.
[03:16:17.255 --> 03:16:18.216]  It's regional wars.
[03:16:18.456 --> 03:16:19.396]  It's a culture war.
[03:16:19.416 --> 03:16:22.457]  I'm gonna just give you a brief gestalt lay history.
[03:16:22.557 --> 03:16:28.058]  Anybody can go research this for yourself about how Trump is launching, via India, a proxy war.
[03:16:28.158 --> 03:16:31.799]  So to understand what Trump's doing, we have to understand the history of it.
[03:16:32.099 --> 03:16:33.720]  1,400 years ago, Muhammad...
[03:16:34.680 --> 03:16:35.300]  He's right here.
[03:16:35.500 --> 03:16:46.562]  He takes over the key crossroads of the caravans coming out of the empire of India that stretched all the way over to Iran and all the way into China.
[03:16:47.023 --> 03:16:50.323]  India was the dominant force, not China, not Japan at that time.
[03:16:50.363 --> 03:16:53.884]  They were the most powerful empire in the East and were expanding trade.
[03:16:53.944 --> 03:16:55.424]  So that's what's happening in India.
[03:16:55.524 --> 03:17:04.046]  Within just a few hundred years of Muhammad's death, they have already taken over what's Pakistan today, pushed the Indian empire back, taken over and surrounded India.
[03:17:05.239 --> 03:17:09.403]  You have Kashmir that is the birthplace of the Indian culture and set up India.
[03:17:09.463 --> 03:17:12.205]  Folks floated in from all over the world because there was so much prosperity in that area.
[03:17:12.305 --> 03:17:13.587]  So, all of that's going on.
[03:17:13.667 --> 03:17:14.568]  That's just some of the background.
[03:17:14.688 --> 03:17:16.209]  So, China is over here.
[03:17:16.489 --> 03:17:17.951]  They're starting to go into Hong Kong.
[03:17:17.971 --> 03:17:18.972]  They're starting to go into Taiwan.
[03:17:19.372 --> 03:17:20.633]  They're threatening Japan.
[03:17:20.733 --> 03:17:24.597]  They're building islands all over the place, way down here, even by the Philippines.
[03:17:24.617 --> 03:17:25.978]  The Philippines is having to threaten them now.
[03:17:26.118 --> 03:17:29.300]  They're sending in their companies that are really paramilitary and others.
[03:17:29.440 --> 03:17:30.621]  They're taking over the colleges.
[03:17:30.641 --> 03:17:32.242]  They're buying everybody off just like they're doing here.
[03:17:32.262 --> 03:17:33.163]  They're buying off the media.
[03:17:33.203 --> 03:17:40.968]  They're using all this incredible money they've been given by us, giving trade superiority of $900 billion a year for decades, to be able to just take over the planet.
[03:17:41.248 --> 03:17:42.749]  Again, they were given $98 billion.
[03:17:43.690 --> 03:17:44.571]  percent of rare minerals.
[03:17:44.991 --> 03:17:45.971]  You just don't get that.
[03:17:46.271 --> 03:17:48.192]  No one else is allowed by the globalists to operate.
[03:17:48.232 --> 03:17:48.833]  They sue you.
[03:17:48.893 --> 03:17:49.853]  The UN comes after you.
[03:17:49.993 --> 03:17:52.815]  China is able to do human clones, take people's organs.
[03:17:52.855 --> 03:17:54.055]  They just do whatever the hell they want.
[03:17:54.095 --> 03:17:57.397]  They're God, basically, because they're an evil Qaikom force feeding on their own people.
[03:17:57.417 --> 03:17:59.898]  They're the model of the global technocracy the NWO wants.
[03:18:00.058 --> 03:18:03.460]  So Trump and Japan and South Korea and others form an alliance.
[03:18:03.720 --> 03:18:06.564]  Soon as Trump gets elected, he says this new order is a screwjob for everybody.
[03:18:06.824 --> 03:18:08.766]  We're not going along with it, including the Chinese people.
[03:18:09.026 --> 03:18:09.627]  They don't like it.
[03:18:09.707 --> 03:18:12.351]  He meets with the leader of India.
[03:18:12.551 --> 03:18:13.171]  He hugs him.
[03:18:13.292 --> 03:18:16.556]  He says, hey, if China gives you problems, I keep trying to take over Kashmir.
[03:18:16.716 --> 03:18:23.464]  And at 49, the UN made India create an autonomous zone, which then now China has come in and openly taken over about a third of the country.
[03:18:23.604 --> 03:18:28.886]  The Islamists are pouring in, now pushing to the new borders of India and trying to take India proper over itself.
[03:18:29.106 --> 03:18:31.707]  And again, leftist media calls it Indian extremism.
[03:18:32.087 --> 03:18:33.688]  They call him a Hindu extremist.
[03:18:34.108 --> 03:18:37.409]  Even though the Pakistanis were Indians until the Islamists took it over.
[03:18:37.429 --> 03:18:39.410]  There's Hindu and Buddhist temples all over Pakistan.
[03:18:39.450 --> 03:18:40.010]  Well, there were.
[03:18:40.130 --> 03:18:41.170]  The Muslims blew them all up.
[03:18:41.290 --> 03:18:42.891]  So, all of this is happening.
[03:18:43.131 --> 03:18:44.211]  All of this is going on.
[03:18:44.271 --> 03:18:47.753]  And then once they take your country over, they remove any symbols you ever existed.
[03:18:47.773 --> 03:18:49.093]  They erase that they were Indians.
[03:18:49.493 --> 03:18:51.594]  So, you've got China bordering.
[03:18:52.194 --> 03:18:53.735]  Right here in what is Kashmir.
[03:18:54.035 --> 03:18:58.518]  And so Trump green-lighted, go ahead, you're not under that UN thing anymore, go in.
[03:18:58.658 --> 03:19:03.841]  Within hours of what happened with the currency devaluation, within hours, they sent the troops in.
[03:19:03.962 --> 03:19:04.722]  The Indians did.
[03:19:04.802 --> 03:19:07.924]  And I want to be clear, India didn't invade Kashmir.
[03:19:08.004 --> 03:19:13.007]  Kashmir was stolen from it when the British Empire was dissolving and becoming the New World Order.
[03:19:13.027 --> 03:19:14.528]  Because India never really got its freedom.
[03:19:14.668 --> 03:19:18.831]  Under their current leader, India is, to a certain extent, actually becoming independent, finally.
[03:19:19.111 --> 03:19:25.834]  So, you got China right here, and this is the key piece in the whole chessboard, is this whole fight going on over India.
[03:19:26.014 --> 03:19:32.497]  Because you'll control the trade routes, you'll control the water, you'll control everything into Burma and Thailand and Vietnam and the Philippines.
[03:19:32.597 --> 03:19:34.098]  You've all had wars with China.
[03:19:34.238 --> 03:19:37.439]  China is completely expansionist, completely out of control.
[03:19:37.579 --> 03:19:40.961]  And so Trump has turned the Indians loose to be on their flank.
[03:19:41.181 --> 03:19:45.503]  And to let China know you're now in a vice grip, and this is the stuff that World War 4 is made of?
[03:19:45.783 --> 03:19:46.924]  This is the real deal.
[03:19:46.964 --> 03:19:50.426]  Doesn't mean nuclear missiles, doesn't mean huge explosions, even though both sides are nuclear powers.
[03:19:51.046 --> 03:19:51.746]  India and Pakistan.
[03:19:52.066 --> 03:19:58.069]  It means Trump's taking the gloves off, he's for real, this is really happening, and the House of World Government is dead!
[03:20:06.073 --> 03:20:08.714]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:26.068 --> 03:20:27.689]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:20:27.989 --> 03:20:37.112]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:20:40.093 --> 03:20:41.714]  Hey, great being here.
[03:20:43.314 --> 03:20:44.515]  Thanks for having me on.
[03:20:45.495 --> 03:20:49.577]  And Owen asked me a couple of questions, and one of them was about Argentina.
[03:20:51.803 --> 03:20:54.425]  They had a called primary election.
[03:20:54.465 --> 03:20:57.707]  But what this is, it indicates who's going to win in October.
[03:20:59.147 --> 03:20:59.348]  And.
[03:21:00.888 --> 03:21:11.375]  Here's the Monday today, the Wall Street Journal, before the story came out, you see all these underlines, by the way, this is what I do every day.
[03:21:11.395 --> 03:21:19.800]  I read newspapers, online stuff, and I underline the salient points of the story.
[03:21:19.840 --> 03:21:21.581]  So you could say I had to read the whole thing.
[03:21:22.005 --> 03:21:25.307]  You just can't get it from the headlines, a little sound bites.
[03:21:25.967 --> 03:21:27.488]  And that's all people are doing now.
[03:21:27.548 --> 03:21:29.609]  They just have everything on their hand.
[03:21:30.710 --> 03:21:32.311]  And so everything's handheld.
[03:21:32.371 --> 03:21:36.153]  And that's all you're getting is a handful rather than the entire story.
[03:21:36.893 --> 03:21:42.456]  So just a couple of things out here about a win for Mr. Fernandez.
[03:21:42.476 --> 03:21:44.517]  This is the guy that he was running against.
[03:21:45.218 --> 03:21:50.881]  Of more than five percentage points would raise fears among investors about the return
[03:21:51.752 --> 03:21:52.653]  To the power of Ms.
[03:21:52.713 --> 03:21:54.334]  Kirshner.
[03:21:54.834 --> 03:21:58.036]  She was running the show before him and her husband was running it before that.
[03:21:58.877 --> 03:22:04.280]  During her eight-year term that ended in 2015, Ms.
[03:22:04.320 --> 03:22:09.684]  Kirshner nationalized businesses, implemented price controls, and defaulted on Argentinian debt.
[03:22:11.245 --> 03:22:19.550]  As Mr. McCree grapples with anger over an economic recession and double-digit inflation,
[03:22:20.882 --> 03:22:23.563]  They all love this guy Macri.
[03:22:23.623 --> 03:22:26.305]  He was one of the white shoe boys.
[03:22:26.405 --> 03:22:27.425]  That's right.
[03:22:28.105 --> 03:22:30.146]  Brainwashed into the club.
[03:22:30.867 --> 03:22:33.268]  He was gonna fix everything.
[03:22:33.708 --> 03:22:36.770]  And boy did he fix it for the Argentinians.
[03:22:37.270 --> 03:22:37.970]  That's right.
[03:22:38.470 --> 03:22:43.053]  Borrowed 57 billion dollars from the IMF.
[03:22:43.613 --> 03:22:46.194]  The International Mafia Federation.
[03:22:46.894 --> 03:22:50.096]  You know, the ones they call it Austerity Measures.
[03:22:51.107 --> 03:22:53.088]  We're gonna raise your taxes.
[03:22:53.709 --> 03:22:55.390]  We're gonna take your benefits.
[03:22:56.071 --> 03:23:00.474]  We're gonna increase the retirement age until after you die.
[03:23:01.114 --> 03:23:06.739]  Because we made bad loans with our banks, and we don't like making bad loans.
[03:23:07.499 --> 03:23:16.526]  So we're gonna take the money from you, and we got a little clown over here that's just one of the boys that's gonna do what we tell him to do.
[03:23:17.594 --> 03:23:21.755]  That's what they did in Argentina, as they did in Greece and other places.
[03:23:22.455 --> 03:23:23.795]  Shafting it to the people.
[03:23:25.216 --> 03:23:28.096]  So, what else do they have to say in this article?
[03:23:29.196 --> 03:23:38.658]  In the Wall Street Journal, double-digit inflation, economic turmoil would undercut his efforts to persuade voters to give him another four-year term.
[03:23:39.679 --> 03:23:43.619]  Persuade voters so he could shaft them for another four years.
[03:23:44.380 --> 03:23:45.940]  Mr. McCree was elected in 2000,
[03:23:47.205 --> 03:23:48.665]  In June, you know what their inflation rate was?
[03:23:48.685 --> 03:23:48.665]  56%!
[03:23:48.705 --> 03:23:49.446]  He did a great job!
[03:23:50.046 --> 03:23:50.846]  He's terrific!
[03:23:50.866 --> 03:23:51.806]  One of the white shoe boys.
[03:23:51.826 --> 03:23:52.427]  So here's the vote.
[03:23:52.447 --> 03:23:53.847]  Macri got 47%
[03:24:17.423 --> 03:24:17.963]  Excuse me.
[03:24:18.584 --> 03:24:20.965]  He was defeated by Fernandez, who got 47%.
[03:24:22.807 --> 03:24:24.148]  He got the grand total of 32%.
[03:24:24.228 --> 03:24:31.152]  They said 5% would really change the direction of this.
[03:24:34.434 --> 03:24:35.135]  So there you go.
[03:24:35.755 --> 03:24:38.837]  That's what's going on in Argentina.
[03:24:40.478 --> 03:24:45.602]  The importance of this is bigger, of course, than what's going on in Argentina with their
[03:24:47.163 --> 03:24:51.387]  I think it's about a 23% unemployment rate.
[03:24:52.228 --> 03:24:57.052]  Owen mentioned how the peso took a big hit.
[03:24:57.572 --> 03:25:01.136]  The Argentinian peso is down over 50% already this year.
[03:25:03.197 --> 03:25:06.100]  And it's going on all over the world.
[03:25:07.741 --> 03:25:13.126]  Not at one time, but at different levels all over.
[03:25:16.914 --> 03:25:20.818]  Risk of recession grows for Asian commercial hub.
[03:25:22.179 --> 03:25:27.244]  Of course, they're talking now a lot about what's going on in Hong Kong, but throughout the area.
[03:25:29.206 --> 03:25:33.390]  Several researchers are expecting quarter on quarter contraction.
[03:25:34.411 --> 03:25:40.537]  The second such decline in a row and a technical definition of recession for Hong Kong.
[03:25:45.299 --> 03:25:46.660]  It's not only there.
[03:25:46.880 --> 03:25:50.422]  You're looking at slowdowns in Indonesia, India.
[03:25:50.462 --> 03:25:51.903]  You saw what they did in India.
[03:25:52.123 --> 03:25:53.344]  You know one of my sayings.
[03:25:54.005 --> 03:25:56.867]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:25:58.468 --> 03:26:00.409]  The Indian equity markets are plummeting.
[03:26:01.489 --> 03:26:03.050]  They had an election recently.
[03:26:03.411 --> 03:26:05.712]  Modi, the Prime Minister, got re-elected.
[03:26:06.413 --> 03:26:08.174]  The economy's going south.
[03:26:10.415 --> 03:26:12.657]  So now, they just repealed a law
[03:26:13.442 --> 03:26:28.570]  That they did in 1947, giving Kashmir the right to have their own government.
[03:26:29.350 --> 03:26:30.311]  That's gone now.
[03:26:31.711 --> 03:26:40.095]  So it's one place after another where we're seeing the loss of rights and a buildup to war.
[03:26:41.956 --> 03:26:42.937]  You name the country,
[03:26:44.520 --> 03:26:45.801]  And you can see the problems.
[03:26:47.643 --> 03:26:50.565]  Khan steps up Kashmir rhetoric with India.
[03:26:50.625 --> 03:26:54.949]  Khan, of course, is the prime minister of Pakistan.
[03:26:57.632 --> 03:27:02.056]  He said about what India did amounted to an impending genocide.
[03:27:02.856 --> 03:27:08.501]  Attempt is to change demography of Kashmir through ethnic cleansing.
[03:27:09.422 --> 03:27:11.484]  He questioned if, quote,
[03:27:11.974 --> 03:27:18.356]  Will the world watch and appease as they did Hitler's at Munich?
[03:27:19.477 --> 03:27:20.397]  He continued.
[03:27:23.518 --> 03:27:30.881]  It will lead to suppression of Muslims in India and eventually lead to the targeting of Pakistan.
[03:27:33.502 --> 03:27:37.063]  These are two nuclear enemies.
[03:27:40.629 --> 03:27:42.711]  This is from the Financial Times.
[03:27:43.171 --> 03:27:54.201]  The heavily militarized line of division between the two nuclear-armed states in Kashmir is considered one of the most dangerous fault lines in the world.
[03:27:57.604 --> 03:28:01.348]  So, hardly anything's coming out of Kashmir now.
[03:28:02.309 --> 03:28:06.953]  India's imposed strict limits on social media, anything coming out of there.
[03:28:08.052 --> 03:28:10.792]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:28:12.253 --> 03:28:13.953]  And that's what we're concerned about.
[03:28:15.373 --> 03:28:17.394]  I said this about two months ago.
[03:28:17.954 --> 03:28:22.274]  First person I mentioned it on the show, I believe, was David Knight.
[03:28:23.755 --> 03:28:26.275]  We are entering into the greatest depression.
[03:28:27.735 --> 03:28:30.016]  I'll go through more of the numbers when we come back.
[03:28:31.336 --> 03:28:33.676]  They're real and they're not so good.
[03:28:34.997 --> 03:28:37.437]  People already know there's a depression.
[03:28:38.851 --> 03:28:45.734]  They feel it in their bones, and they feel it in their pocketbook.
[03:28:45.814 --> 03:28:49.636]  It's gonna hurt, it's gonna be deep, and it's gonna be long.
[03:28:51.296 --> 03:28:53.217]  We'll tell you what to do and how to prepare.
[03:28:53.237 --> 03:28:56.519]  When we come back.
[03:29:09.480 --> 03:29:22.926]  If you want to bet on your future, if you want to bet on Americana, if you want to bet on not being run by the shycoms, with Senate and House hearings now on how they literally fund the Democrats and MSM and CNN, the Chinese government does.
[03:29:23.006 --> 03:29:23.846]  It's all coming out.
[03:29:24.266 --> 03:29:25.167]  It's so devastating.
[03:29:25.247 --> 03:29:27.948]  And the government isn't even sure how to bring this out.
[03:29:27.968 --> 03:29:29.889]  They're starting to bring it out, going, Democrats, stop!
[03:29:30.009 --> 03:29:31.049]  Democrats aren't going to stop.
[03:29:31.109 --> 03:29:32.410]  They're trying to cause a civil war right now.
[03:29:32.430 --> 03:29:33.771]  Like, they're starting to get some purchase.
[03:29:33.931 --> 03:29:34.671]  Trying to start a fire?
[03:29:34.711 --> 03:29:35.611]  They got some fire going.
[03:29:35.711 --> 03:29:40.253]  All the physical attacks, shootings, bombings, ICE facilities getting attacked, dead people everywhere.
[03:29:40.413 --> 03:29:41.214]  It's on, folks.
[03:29:41.514 --> 03:29:44.915]  And if you think it's bad now, if they really get traction, it's going to go insane.
[03:29:45.015 --> 03:29:51.578]  So now, more than you've ever done, for yourself, for me, for everybody, spread the word about this broadcast on your local station, radio, TV.
[03:29:51.638 --> 03:29:53.719]  Tell folks about InforWars.com, Ford's live show.
[03:29:53.899 --> 03:29:59.264]  And let them know, hey, they wanted to shut this guy down because he exposed the Chinese government funding and controlling Hollywood.
[03:29:59.284 --> 03:30:00.945]  You wonder why Hollywood's anti-American?
[03:30:01.145 --> 03:30:03.867]  It's literally owned by the Chinese military.
[03:30:04.108 --> 03:30:05.649]  UT's basically run by China now.
[03:30:05.869 --> 03:30:06.650]  It's unbelievable.
[03:30:06.670 --> 03:30:08.531]  It's all coming out in Senate and House reports.
[03:30:08.651 --> 03:30:10.273]  But listen, everybody else is scared.
[03:30:10.693 --> 03:30:12.595]  Everybody else ran for the exits a long time ago.
[03:30:12.935 --> 03:30:21.040]  We knew if we told the truth, bet on you, you'd stand up, you'd see what happened, good people in government would see what happened, and that we would finally get people to take action.
[03:30:21.060 --> 03:30:22.902]  But somebody's got to make that first example.
[03:30:23.042 --> 03:30:24.643]  So I am honored to be in the position.
[03:30:25.768 --> 03:30:29.850]  I've had the enemy trying to destroy me right now, and the threats and all of it.
[03:30:30.170 --> 03:30:31.511]  It just makes me so alive.
[03:30:31.571 --> 03:30:34.432]  It's amazing, and I am very thankful to God for putting me in this position.
[03:30:34.713 --> 03:30:39.355]  With that said, I want to fight hard, and I need you to buy the products at InfoWarstore.com.
[03:30:39.415 --> 03:30:46.759]  Huge sale, the one-year anniversary banning sale, the ban-niversary sale, 50-60% off, storewide free shipping, double Patriot points.

[03:30:49.480 --> 03:30:56.854]  Not just a second American Revolution, but a pro-human future against the devil-worshipping Satanists and their off-world controllers.
[03:31:05.000 --> 03:31:05.981]  Samuel, thanks for calling.
[03:31:06.221 --> 03:31:07.722]  Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[03:31:07.802 --> 03:31:08.143]  Hello.
[03:31:08.323 --> 03:31:13.207]  Alex, if I can just quickly, InfoWarsStore.com, I want to thank you for Polnblock.
[03:31:13.427 --> 03:31:14.048]  It's amazing.
[03:31:14.168 --> 03:31:18.451]  I've used so many different antihistamines over the years because I get really bad hay fever.
[03:31:18.671 --> 03:31:22.955]  And the antihistamines sometimes work, sometimes don't, but they never quit.
[03:31:23.135 --> 03:31:24.656]  This is a known patent out of France.
[03:31:24.676 --> 03:31:32.762]  You have to pay for the patent, where they just discovered that if you feed a certain secret diet to quail, and then you get their eggs, it creates this incredible antihistamine of a certain type of quail.
[03:31:32.782 --> 03:31:35.544]  How fast did it take for pollen block to kick in for you?
[03:31:52.796 --> 03:31:56.198]  It's pretty much straight away, you know, in maybe 10 minutes, maybe 20 minutes.
[03:31:56.378 --> 03:31:57.038]  It just works.
[03:31:57.058 --> 03:32:07.784]  The antihistamines, the pharmaceutical products, I find that with those, I can't take them until I start getting symptoms, and even then, they might not kick in for half an hour, or they might not kick in at all, depending on the day.
[03:32:07.824 --> 03:32:10.405]  Polonblock works every single time.
[03:32:10.445 --> 03:32:15.108]  Well, that's the great part about this, and for whatever reason, France discovered it like 50 years ago.
[03:32:15.348 --> 03:32:18.429]  It's still got to be, even in this region of France, it's very complex.
[03:32:18.449 --> 03:32:19.770]  They don't even know why, but they think it's
[03:32:19.850 --> 03:32:20.350]  That's right.
[03:32:41.368 --> 03:32:42.889]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.504 --> 03:33:24.546]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:24.886 --> 03:33:27.087]  It's Gerald Celente.
[03:33:27.607 --> 03:33:30.609]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:30.649 --> 03:33:35.312]  Hey, great being here.
[03:33:35.352 --> 03:33:39.255]  You know, Owen said, I mean, wait, it must be ready to boogie.
[03:33:39.735 --> 03:33:40.816]  He said, yeah, you got it.
[03:33:41.636 --> 03:33:42.997]  You know, you know what I say?
[03:33:43.376 --> 03:33:48.379]  You got to boogie before the lights go out, because tomorrow is Ithaca.
[03:33:48.459 --> 03:33:51.540]  And I boogie with super male vitality.
[03:33:51.660 --> 03:33:53.121]  Keeps that boogie alive.
[03:33:53.161 --> 03:33:55.222]  And also, you know the deal.
[03:33:55.923 --> 03:33:59.164]  First annual anniversary storewide sale.
[03:33:59.184 --> 03:34:02.306]  50 to 60 percent off InfoWars Life.

[03:34:55.874 --> 03:35:08.782]  Again, I began this by talking about how the mainstream media, the prostitutes, use the language and call anybody that questions
[03:35:09.537 --> 03:35:15.622]  How this guy Epstein was wiped out, a conspiracy theorist believer.
[03:35:16.562 --> 03:35:20.205]  To me, it's a conspiracy theory to believe this guy hung himself.
[03:35:21.026 --> 03:35:23.227]  So anybody, save it for yourself.
[03:35:23.588 --> 03:35:24.889]  I don't want to hear it.
[03:35:26.430 --> 03:35:29.812]  This came down from the top, as I see it.
[03:35:30.213 --> 03:35:31.754]  And again, we played the clip.
[03:35:32.775 --> 03:35:36.838]  We did it on our Trends in the News broadcast on July 29th.
[03:35:39.386 --> 03:35:44.167]  Two weeks before the hanging.
[03:35:46.028 --> 03:35:51.830]  So, do what you can to support InfoWars and keep the truth alive.
[03:35:52.790 --> 03:36:04.793]  They should be banning the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and ABC, NBC, CBS for selling these conspiracy theories that he hung himself.
[03:36:06.034 --> 03:36:07.334]  I was talking before
[03:36:09.560 --> 03:36:11.622]  About the greatest depression.
[03:36:13.403 --> 03:36:18.306]  This is a time to prepare so you can prevail and prosper.
[03:36:19.407 --> 03:36:26.372]  Now, I've been on Alex Jones Show a long time and the major media for decades.
[03:36:27.993 --> 03:36:36.339]  I'm not bragging, but if you go to our TrendsResearch.com site and hit the forecast list, you'll see the things I forecast.
[03:36:37.571 --> 03:36:47.235]  And I made my name back in 1987 as a trend forecaster, forecasting the 1987 stock market crash, the first in the world to do it.
[03:36:48.775 --> 03:36:50.056]  And the dot-com bust.
[03:36:52.177 --> 03:36:53.297]  And clean foods.
[03:36:53.717 --> 03:36:56.338]  Coined that term, New York Times did a big story on it.
[03:36:56.898 --> 03:36:58.959]  Bottled water trend back in the 80s.
[03:37:02.521 --> 03:37:03.461]  Panic of 08.
[03:37:03.981 --> 03:37:05.242]  I took out the domain name in 2007.
[03:37:07.731 --> 03:37:08.591]  One after another.
[03:37:09.752 --> 03:37:11.192]  The Gold Bull Run.
[03:37:12.152 --> 03:37:14.213]  The first one I did in the 2000s.
[03:37:14.993 --> 03:37:17.494]  Just before gold took off, it was in the 300 range.
[03:37:18.834 --> 03:37:25.336]  On June 6th of this year, we sent a trend alert out to all our subscribers of the Trends Journal.
[03:37:25.956 --> 03:37:33.738]  And of course, you could subscribe too by going to TrendsJournal.com, the only magazine in the world where you will read history before it happens.
[03:37:34.558 --> 03:37:36.219]  You tune into the major media,
[03:37:36.826 --> 03:37:37.807]  You get what happened.
[03:37:39.468 --> 03:37:42.571]  You get yesterday's news today.
[03:37:42.891 --> 03:37:46.053]  The Trends Journal, you get tomorrow's news today.
[03:37:46.974 --> 03:37:51.017]  And of course, there's a discount request page there as well, if you can't afford the full price.
[03:37:51.177 --> 03:37:52.298]  It's only $129 a year.
[03:37:52.919 --> 03:37:57.342]  But anyway, we sent out a trend alert.
[03:37:58.022 --> 03:38:00.324]  And again, I've been on Alex's show and many shows.
[03:38:00.404 --> 03:38:04.808]  I've been negative on gold for over five years.
[03:38:06.690 --> 03:38:08.171]  I called the bottom of gold.
[03:38:08.351 --> 03:38:09.872]  It was only $50 off.
[03:38:12.253 --> 03:38:15.916]  I said gold had to break over the $14.50 mark to gain strength.
[03:38:17.977 --> 03:38:23.540]  So on June 6th, when gold was selling at $1,332 an ounce, and as we speak, it's about $1,510 an ounce.
[03:38:23.580 --> 03:38:26.122]  I said the gold bull run has begun.
[03:38:35.834 --> 03:38:38.135]  Because gold solidified over $1,325.
[03:38:38.375 --> 03:38:42.017]  That was the first point I was looking for.
[03:38:42.957 --> 03:38:44.558]  Point number two was $1,385.
[03:38:47.059 --> 03:38:48.520]  Went right by that one quick.
[03:38:49.581 --> 03:38:52.342]  And then the next one was $1,450.
[03:38:52.522 --> 03:38:57.664]  I've been saying this now, for the better part, almost six years.
[03:38:59.705 --> 03:39:00.986]  And now it's well over the $1,450 mark.
[03:39:03.655 --> 03:39:06.256]  I see a very small downside risk of gold.
[03:39:06.316 --> 03:39:07.976]  I do not give financial advice.
[03:39:08.136 --> 03:39:09.496]  I am a trend forecaster.
[03:39:09.857 --> 03:39:11.277]  I don't tell you what to do with your money.
[03:39:12.277 --> 03:39:14.818]  I'm not an investment strategist.
[03:39:15.838 --> 03:39:17.138]  I'm not licensed to be one.
[03:39:17.158 --> 03:39:18.959]  I don't want to be one.
[03:39:19.259 --> 03:39:20.419]  I'm a trend forecaster.
[03:39:21.159 --> 03:39:25.000]  The downside risk of gold for me right now, as I see it, $1,430.
[03:39:25.040 --> 03:39:27.101]  Maybe $1,400.
[03:39:32.329 --> 03:39:35.910]  That's a very small downside risk in the futures markets.
[03:39:38.531 --> 03:39:40.771]  The upside, I believe, is going to crash through $2,000.
[03:39:41.511 --> 03:39:46.733]  And now I'm going to start telling you why more and more.
[03:39:47.273 --> 03:39:55.295]  And again, but before I do, I'm telling you to consider becoming very serious about planning for the future.
[03:39:56.835 --> 03:39:59.436]  Remember, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:40:01.089 --> 03:40:06.333]  And my other saying is, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[03:40:08.454 --> 03:40:16.740]  You're going to see violence, demonstrations, robberies, murder in the first degree.
[03:40:19.002 --> 03:40:27.408]  People are going to be out of their minds, do anything they want to get what they want, because they have nothing to lose.
[03:40:31.237 --> 03:40:33.858]  When people have nothing to lose, they lose it.
[03:40:35.378 --> 03:40:41.500]  So, consider buying up enough provisions.
[03:40:43.520 --> 03:40:49.382]  Consider guns, gold, and a getaway plan if things get really ugly.
[03:40:52.422 --> 03:40:59.084]  One of the first sectors that's going to lose their jobs is the real estate sector.
[03:41:01.803 --> 03:41:03.444]  The hospitality sector.
[03:41:05.625 --> 03:41:07.786]  That's where you're going to start seeing the first hits.
[03:41:11.267 --> 03:41:13.188]  Doesn't mean everything's going down.
[03:41:13.208 --> 03:41:14.389]  A lot is going to go up.
[03:41:17.930 --> 03:41:20.751]  And those are the opportunities you're going to want to see.
[03:41:21.552 --> 03:41:22.492]  The game changes.
[03:41:23.853 --> 03:41:24.273]  That's all.
[03:41:26.014 --> 03:41:28.915]  If you're stuck in what you have and where you were,
[03:41:30.250 --> 03:41:33.011]  You're not going to be ready to move forward when the big change comes.
[03:41:35.112 --> 03:41:39.013]  And when I talk about the products, of course, you know, I promote them.
[03:41:40.714 --> 03:41:48.656]  Because, you know, I believe in them, number one, you know, the ones that I've had that Alex Jones has on his Infowars stores.
[03:41:51.357 --> 03:41:51.537]  And.
[03:41:53.158 --> 03:41:53.858]  Number two.
[03:41:55.839 --> 03:41:59.820]  The first thing to consider when the greatest depression hits,
[03:42:01.038 --> 03:42:02.839]  It's for you to be in the best shape you can.
[03:42:04.400 --> 03:42:04.960]  Physically.
[03:42:08.022 --> 03:42:08.823]  Emotionally.
[03:42:10.764 --> 03:42:11.644]  And spiritually.
[03:42:13.806 --> 03:42:15.166]  I'm not talking religiously.
[03:42:15.186 --> 03:42:16.567]  Everybody has their own trip.
[03:42:18.008 --> 03:42:19.669]  But being the best person you could be.
[03:42:19.709 --> 03:42:20.870]  And I want to make this clear.
[03:42:20.890 --> 03:42:23.591]  I'm not the same guy I was when, you know, you grow up.
[03:42:23.611 --> 03:42:23.891]  You do.
[03:42:24.232 --> 03:42:26.073]  Everybody has their crap that you do.
[03:42:26.773 --> 03:42:28.154]  You try to learn and be better.
[03:42:30.168 --> 03:42:38.395]  So this is really a time to consider doing the best you can, to be in the best shape you can.
[03:42:40.076 --> 03:42:40.937]  Game's over.
[03:42:42.118 --> 03:42:42.838]  Fight's on.
[03:42:44.400 --> 03:42:49.324]  And people are going to be fighting for their life when the greatest depression hits.
[03:42:50.665 --> 03:42:52.226]  And if you don't believe me, it's going to hit.
[03:42:53.487 --> 03:42:58.992]  I have some evidence here that's going to make it really clear when we come back.
[03:43:00.166 --> 03:43:09.728]  There's a war on our children because predators know that a child is defenseless.
[03:43:10.428 --> 03:43:16.910]  That a child will be embarrassed when they get abused or hurt and a lot of times won't report it.
[03:43:18.010 --> 03:43:21.471]  And I remember three years ago when the Boy Scouts of America that I was part of
[03:43:22.443 --> 03:43:23.324]  Since I was a Cub Scout.
[03:43:23.885 --> 03:43:36.098]  Good wholesome Americana institution was handing out condoms at their World Jamboree and encouraging promiscuous sex, whether it was heterosexual or homosexual.
[03:43:36.138 --> 03:43:36.979]  That's pedophilia.
[03:43:36.999 --> 03:43:37.520]  That's criminal.
[03:43:38.180 --> 03:43:40.142]  Well, now it's come out in big press conferences.
[03:43:41.169 --> 03:43:52.993]  That there are thousands of protected pedophiles in the Boy Scouts of America who came there to use that great institution as a place to target our children, like shooting fish in a barrel.
[03:43:54.334 --> 03:44:04.137]  And we've seen the National Library Association say they are now places for drag queen story time, where men dressed as clowns, many of them sexual offenders, rapists,
[03:44:06.519 --> 03:44:17.322]  Disguised themselves as It the Clown and come and mothers as a sacrament to evil bring their little babies and sit them on their lap and simulate, well you know what?
[03:44:18.862 --> 03:44:26.584]  Even here in Austin, Texas, recently they're having city council meetings about this and these groups are going and targeting children.
[03:44:26.844 --> 03:44:27.224]  Sometimes
[03:44:28.519 --> 03:44:36.462]  Unannounced at public schools, on career day, men disguised as women come and tell the children you could be a topless dancer at a gay bar.
[03:44:37.463 --> 03:44:38.343]  And now new articles.
[03:44:38.383 --> 03:44:41.864]  Drag Queen shows children how to twerk during story hour.
[03:44:42.145 --> 03:44:44.345]  Just move your bum up and down.
[03:44:45.726 --> 03:44:46.426]  Shake your booty.
[03:44:47.287 --> 03:44:50.128]  If a man did this to your child in a park, you'd say, get the hell away.
[03:44:51.061 --> 03:44:55.403]  If a man talked about your son or daughter's booty and told them they were another sex, they'd get arrested.
[03:44:55.903 --> 03:45:04.588]  But because it's done sanctioned by the state and sanctioned by these institutions, oh well it's okay because no one wants to call it out for what it is.
[03:45:05.328 --> 03:45:07.629]  But here at InfoWars, we are calling it out for what it is.
[03:45:08.490 --> 03:45:11.771]  And you know who the enemy is by who you can't speak about.
[03:45:14.448 --> 03:45:16.830]  We had Facebook and Twitter before we got banned over a year ago.
[03:45:16.950 --> 03:45:18.292]  We even recorded these conversations.
[03:45:18.312 --> 03:45:19.873]  We're going to do a report on them soon.
[03:45:19.913 --> 03:45:25.238]  Saying, look, do whatever you want, just don't talk about Islam and don't talk about the trans movement.
[03:45:25.798 --> 03:45:30.002]  We said, well, we're not against people if a man wants to try to be a woman or vice versa, but leave kids alone.
[03:45:31.083 --> 03:45:32.485]  Well, that's what we get banned for.
[03:45:32.505 --> 03:45:34.807]  So I'm proud that I stand up against predators.
[03:45:35.267 --> 03:45:40.192]  I'm proud that Infowars stands up against these people that are there, whether they know it or not.
[03:45:41.749 --> 03:45:46.633]  We're grooming and recruiting and preparing children to be abused.
[03:45:47.114 --> 03:45:49.456]  And a lot of them get up and say, oh, we're here to groom your children.
[03:45:49.836 --> 03:45:51.358]  We're here to prepare them for their new life.
[03:45:51.938 --> 03:45:52.799]  And we're going to do it.
[03:45:53.980 --> 03:45:58.784]  My God, ladies and gentlemen, you wouldn't let the Army try to recruit your five-year-old, even though the Army's good overall.
[03:45:59.065 --> 03:46:00.486]  Still, that's, they're five.
[03:46:00.586 --> 03:46:01.707]  They need to make that decision when they're 18.
[03:46:03.069 --> 03:46:06.430]  This is about what sex they want to be, or to be chemically castrated.
[03:46:06.790 --> 03:46:10.651]  This is the most hardcore child abuse the world could ever imagine.
[03:46:11.772 --> 03:46:14.072]  So we've made a bold stand, and we're reaching a lot of people.
[03:46:15.293 --> 03:46:18.514]  But without you supporting us, we won't reach new people.
[03:46:18.594 --> 03:46:25.276]  It's only through word of mouth now that we're able to get out, via email, via text message, via person-to-person, for people to learn about InfoWars.com.
[03:46:27.603 --> 03:46:32.166]  And it's only by you going to m4warstore.com with this big sale that's got to end in just a few days.

[03:46:34.367 --> 03:46:35.147]  Double Patriot points.
[03:46:35.568 --> 03:46:37.929]  And getting staples and products you need that we're able to be here.
[03:46:38.449 --> 03:46:39.710]  So we want to continue to fight.
[03:46:39.870 --> 03:46:40.791]  And thank you for your support.
[03:46:41.031 --> 03:46:43.532]  But without your support, the enemy's going to win.
[03:46:43.592 --> 03:46:44.673]  So please commit now.

[03:46:54.799 --> 03:46:56.740]  Thank you for holding M4Wars in your hand.
[03:47:06.056 --> 03:47:23.005]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:25.246 --> 03:47:28.168]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:28.688 --> 03:47:32.350]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:47:35.310 --> 03:47:38.533]  Hey, great being here, great being here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:39.073 --> 03:47:41.875]  I want to follow up on the questions, you know, that Owen asked me.
[03:47:41.935 --> 03:47:42.996]  I wrote them down over here.
[03:47:43.757 --> 03:47:44.958]  Talked about Guatemala.
[03:47:45.038 --> 03:47:49.441]  No, no more deal to work with Trump with the new president being elected.
[03:47:50.902 --> 03:47:52.584]  I'm talking about the greatest depression.
[03:47:53.464 --> 03:47:58.208]  The system of trend forecasting is called global nomic, meaning all things are connected.
[03:47:59.849 --> 03:48:04.553]  Or as Chief Seattle is alleged to have said, all things are connected like the blood which unites us all.
[03:48:05.515 --> 03:48:09.656]  So, going back to the immigration problem, this is global.
[03:48:10.757 --> 03:48:15.478]  As the Greatest Depression hits, you haven't seen anything.
[03:48:16.238 --> 03:48:19.379]  You know why they don't want to do the Trump deal with Guatemala?
[03:48:19.979 --> 03:48:21.600]  They want to get the people out of there.
[03:48:21.620 --> 03:48:23.960]  Because they have their own problems.
[03:48:26.341 --> 03:48:27.761]  They don't have enough jobs.
[03:48:28.702 --> 03:48:29.742]  They can't feed them.
[03:48:29.762 --> 03:48:30.842]  They can't house them.
[03:48:32.243 --> 03:48:32.903]  They want them out.
[03:48:35.754 --> 03:48:45.339]  Human waves out of Africa, out of South America, out of poor places in Asia.
[03:48:46.619 --> 03:48:47.660]  It's not going to stop.
[03:48:49.901 --> 03:48:53.782]  The worst shape the global economy gets into, more human waves.
[03:48:54.763 --> 03:49:03.447]  So, Owen also mentioned that Hillary Clinton was doing a gig pro-immigration.
[03:49:06.281 --> 03:49:09.722]  I want to have a referendum on each state ballot.
[03:49:10.983 --> 03:49:11.583]  Very simple.
[03:49:12.964 --> 03:49:20.767]  Where we, the people, will decide whether or not to allow illegal immigrants to come into the nation.
[03:49:23.868 --> 03:49:25.389]  And it's a very simple ballot.
[03:49:27.510 --> 03:49:34.873]  Yes, I would like more illegal and non-legal
[03:49:36.095 --> 03:50:01.523]  Illegal and legal immigrants to come into America, I am willing to pay X amount of dollars in taxes to feed them, to house them, to clothe them, educate them, and for medical benefits.
[03:50:02.763 --> 03:50:03.363]  Very simple.
[03:50:04.884 --> 03:50:05.744]  Or, no.
[03:50:07.228 --> 03:50:23.233]  I do not want any more immigrants, illegal or legal, and I'm willing to pay X amount of dollars to protect our borders.
[03:50:24.474 --> 03:50:26.595]  And by the way, I'm not in favor of a wall.
[03:50:27.495 --> 03:50:28.775]  This is the 21st century.
[03:50:28.795 --> 03:50:29.636]  You don't need a wall.
[03:50:30.556 --> 03:50:36.498]  I want to bring home all the troops from the over 800 bases we have in some, what?
[03:50:39.164 --> 03:50:40.165]  How many countries?
[03:50:41.225 --> 03:50:43.086]  Ninety countries around the world.
[03:50:44.807 --> 03:50:46.288]  And have them protect the borders.
[03:50:46.588 --> 03:50:54.453]  And with the new technology that we have, it could be done in a much more effective and without destroying so much of the economy and wasting so much money.
[03:50:55.653 --> 03:50:57.294]  So it's a very simple referendum.
[03:50:58.495 --> 03:50:59.135]  Yes or no?
[03:50:59.876 --> 03:51:01.217]  Let we the people decide.
[03:51:03.798 --> 03:51:05.059]  But they won't do that because
[03:51:06.343 --> 03:51:08.164]  You got the mafia running the group.
[03:51:08.605 --> 03:51:09.766]  The Washington gang.
[03:51:11.607 --> 03:51:16.051]  Now, going back to the economy and talking about what's going to happen with the Greatest Depression.
[03:51:17.092 --> 03:51:18.353]  The jobs that'll be lost.
[03:51:20.114 --> 03:51:21.976]  Again, save your money.
[03:51:22.436 --> 03:51:23.637]  Start saving it now.
[03:51:25.358 --> 03:51:26.279]  Bottled water?
[03:51:27.220 --> 03:51:31.303]  You buy one of the water filters that you have over there that you get from info stores.
[03:51:32.964 --> 03:51:35.967]  You get a nice stainless steel container.
[03:51:36.693 --> 03:51:39.294]  So when you're traveling, you're in the car, you fill it up.
[03:51:39.674 --> 03:51:40.414]  That's what I do.
[03:51:40.994 --> 03:51:42.355]  I don't drink bottled water.
[03:51:43.235 --> 03:51:45.596]  It's the same crap you get mostly everywhere else.
[03:51:45.616 --> 03:51:47.116]  What do you think, this is clean stuff?
[03:51:48.977 --> 03:52:00.440]  And I'm a believer that the water in plastic bottles, as it heats up in your car, sends out more and more chemicals in the plastic, and it's not good for your health.
[03:52:01.760 --> 03:52:03.821]  So start thinking in those terms.
[03:52:06.004 --> 03:52:09.265]  It's summertime, and living is easy.
[03:52:10.126 --> 03:52:13.787]  Start going to the farmer's markets, buying the best that you can get.
[03:52:15.668 --> 03:52:27.912]  Remember, to survive and thrive in the greatest depression, number one, you're going to have to be in the best health you can possibly be in, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[03:52:29.833 --> 03:52:33.014]  So, those are some things to consider.
[03:52:33.374 --> 03:52:34.575]  And I was going to say,
[03:52:35.384 --> 03:52:40.707]  When you look at the data, talking before about gold.
[03:52:43.228 --> 03:52:46.870]  Investors weigh specter of sub-zero rates.
[03:52:49.732 --> 03:52:55.274]  There's more than 15 trillion dollars in government debt around the world with negative yields.
[03:52:56.695 --> 03:53:03.779]  That means essentially that savers are holding those bonds which are paying the government
[03:53:04.445 --> 03:53:05.486]  To store their money.
[03:53:06.606 --> 03:53:07.887]  You can't make this crap up.
[03:53:09.928 --> 03:53:10.508]  Germany.
[03:53:11.148 --> 03:53:11.829]  Netherlands.
[03:53:13.470 --> 03:53:13.930]  France.
[03:53:18.112 --> 03:53:20.894]  Countries have negative bond yields.
[03:53:20.974 --> 03:53:21.674]  Japan.
[03:53:23.615 --> 03:53:32.900]  You buy a 10-year or 30-year German bond and you get back less than what you bought it for when you cash it in after it matures.
[03:53:34.065 --> 03:53:37.887]  And now you have a 30-day bond that's paying you a higher rate.
[03:53:37.907 --> 03:53:42.850]  That's called an inversion.
[03:53:42.870 --> 03:53:44.431]  A yield inversion.
[03:53:46.212 --> 03:53:47.433]  Inverted Yield Curve.
[03:53:49.334 --> 03:54:00.661]  Inverted Yield Curves preceded every recession in the last 50 years.
[03:54:01.462 --> 03:54:01.922]  Capisce?
[03:54:03.578 --> 03:54:06.640]  This is not going to be a recession.
[03:54:07.301 --> 03:54:09.443]  It's going to be a depression.
[03:54:10.543 --> 03:54:15.607]  The negative yields, they can't lower them anymore, the interest rates.
[03:54:16.308 --> 03:54:19.110]  The Federal Reserve could only lower interest rates.
[03:54:19.410 --> 03:54:27.636]  And now everyone out there that the business media is covering is saying what I've been saying now for eight months.
[03:54:29.598 --> 03:54:33.301]  That they're going to bring yields back down to near zero.
[03:54:35.484 --> 03:54:37.206]  And by the way, this is hurting the banks.
[03:54:38.647 --> 03:54:39.207]  Big time.
[03:54:39.688 --> 03:54:42.910]  Because they can't make money loaning money out with these kind of rates.
[03:54:44.271 --> 03:54:46.714]  They don't have a lot of room to go down.
[03:54:46.754 --> 03:54:54.360]  The last time they did it, the last recession, they lowered interest rates five percentage points.
[03:54:55.141 --> 03:54:56.822]  Now you got about two left.
[03:54:59.044 --> 03:55:00.045]  And it's global.
[03:55:01.346 --> 03:55:03.688]  In Europe, they got negative interest rates.
[03:55:07.082 --> 03:55:09.163]  Here, one after another.
[03:55:13.044 --> 03:55:16.345]  British economy shrinks for first time in seven years.
[03:55:17.805 --> 03:55:20.666]  UK pound hits multi-year lows.
[03:55:22.467 --> 03:55:30.409]  Italian banks still hold more than double the proportion of bad loans of the whole Eurozone.
[03:55:33.630 --> 03:55:35.331]  Global banks, you ready for this?
[03:55:36.633 --> 03:55:37.753]  This is today's news.
[03:55:38.714 --> 03:55:39.714]  Financial Times.
[03:55:41.354 --> 03:55:48.676]  Cuts 30,000 jobs as investment climate darkens.
[03:55:51.117 --> 03:55:51.377]  Why?
[03:55:51.397 --> 03:55:53.957]  That's racist, they say darkens.
[03:55:54.317 --> 03:55:54.578]  Why?
[03:55:54.658 --> 03:55:56.398]  I think they should do something about that.
[03:55:57.738 --> 03:55:59.279]  Can't call it blacklist anymore.
[03:55:59.299 --> 03:56:00.399]  You can't get blacklisted.
[03:56:01.779 --> 03:56:02.720]  It's garbage.
[03:56:02.780 --> 03:56:04.120]  It's identity politics.
[03:56:05.345 --> 03:56:08.546]  Can't say amen anymore without saying hey women!
[03:56:10.166 --> 03:56:13.507]  Almost 30,000 layoffs have been announced since April.
[03:56:14.127 --> 03:56:15.027]  Since April!
[03:56:15.948 --> 03:56:22.969]  At banks including HSBC, Barclays, Society General, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and others.
[03:56:25.410 --> 03:56:27.330]  European bank woes deepen.
[03:56:28.070 --> 03:56:28.510]  All right?
[03:56:28.631 --> 03:56:30.031]  I'm staying on the banks.
[03:56:31.871 --> 03:56:34.552]  Because if the banks go down, it's a bust.
[03:56:35.549 --> 03:56:39.071]  David Knight is very much on top of what's going on with Deutsche Bank.
[03:56:40.671 --> 03:56:46.094]  And I said, man, this isn't, I don't see them being, bringing down the crash, but it's certainly part of it.
[03:56:46.434 --> 03:56:48.054]  But I may be wrong on that.
[03:56:48.815 --> 03:56:50.295]  And he may be correct on that.
[03:56:50.796 --> 03:56:52.116]  Because this thing's coming down.
[03:56:56.018 --> 03:56:59.859]  Rise in jobless fuels rate cut talk.
[03:57:00.200 --> 03:57:02.681]  Canada's unemployment rate rose in July.
[03:57:03.141 --> 03:57:03.421]  Okay.
[03:57:05.199 --> 03:57:06.940]  Philippines cut rates last week.
[03:57:07.200 --> 03:57:08.861]  Thailand cut rates last week.
[03:57:09.361 --> 03:57:11.082]  India cut rates last week.
[03:57:14.284 --> 03:57:19.507]  New Zealand cut rates 50 basis points last week.
[03:57:21.528 --> 03:57:25.590]  One after another, the thing is coming down.
[03:57:26.371 --> 03:57:33.915]  They're going to do everything they can, everything they can, to keep juicing the markets up with cheap money.
[03:57:36.069 --> 03:57:37.230]  But there's not a lot left.
[03:57:38.191 --> 03:57:39.472]  And not a lot left to do.
[03:57:40.793 --> 03:57:45.697]  So we're suggesting you prepare, prevail, and prosper.
[03:57:46.738 --> 03:57:48.480]  Get ready for the greatest depression.
[03:57:50.461 --> 03:57:51.582]  It's closer than you think.
[03:57:52.924 --> 03:57:53.644]  This is important.
[03:57:54.945 --> 03:57:56.146]  I'm 45 years old.
[03:57:57.267 --> 03:58:00.270]  When I was 35, I swam to 2 miles a day sometimes.
[03:58:00.870 --> 03:58:01.811]  And would jog.
[03:58:02.472 --> 03:58:03.272]  And couldn't lose weight.
[03:58:04.161 --> 03:58:06.703]  Because I didn't have the missing links.
[03:58:06.903 --> 03:58:11.506]  I was deficient in things that nobody ever told me I was deficient in.
[03:58:12.166 --> 03:58:17.330]  I knew all about the private Federal Reserve, the Trilateral Commission, the New World Order, Jeffrey Epstein, and the pedophile rings.
[03:58:17.650 --> 03:58:22.593]  I knew all about geopolitical systems, and the old Soviet Union, and how the globals put the Tchaikovs in.
[03:58:22.793 --> 03:58:24.534]  But I didn't know about PQQ.
[03:58:25.235 --> 03:58:26.555]  I didn't know about CoQ10.
[03:58:27.696 --> 03:58:29.057]  I didn't know about all this.
[03:58:29.858 --> 03:58:31.499]  And I didn't know about clean iodine.
[03:58:32.603 --> 03:58:34.164]  And yeah, I want to fund my operation.
[03:58:35.285 --> 03:58:43.529]  I want you to get products that have changed my life, and changed so many other people's lives, that have 98% reviews, and then experience that I'm not BSing you.
[03:58:44.330 --> 03:58:50.413]  So that for some of you, maybe in the first time in your life, you're going to experience somebody that treats you like they want to be treated.
[03:58:50.433 --> 03:58:51.934]  Let me tell you something right now.
[03:58:53.274 --> 03:58:54.155]  You see DNA Force?
[03:58:55.175 --> 03:58:59.698]  I went out to top manufacturers, the most respected, most highly tested, and I said,
