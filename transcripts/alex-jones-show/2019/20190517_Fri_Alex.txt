[00:00:04.623 --> 00:00:04.745]  Okay.
[00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.188]  I'm gonna grow a magnificent pair of breasts.
[00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:22.730]  I'm going to transition into a woman.
[00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:23.851]  It'll be great.
[00:00:24.131 --> 00:00:36.560]  You should crawl back into your mother's rancid womb, gestate for a few more hours, slide back out, and then learn something about not being an entitled, white, piece of sh**.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.761]  This is Trump, people.
[00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:40.042]  When the rubber meets the road,
[00:00:41.337 --> 00:00:42.597]  Yeah, you're a f***ing idiot.
[00:00:42.657 --> 00:00:44.958]  All you have is a f***ing f***ing president!
[00:00:45.238 --> 00:00:47.659]  He's a racist, stupid piece of s***!
[00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:51.180]  If you guys are working for Alex Jones, you're working for a murderer!
[00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:53.721]  Alex Jones is an a**hole.
[00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.611]  I got a chair going.
[00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:05.615]  If you had to choose one prominent person to be banned next, who would you choose?
[00:01:06.236 --> 00:01:12.081]  You.
[00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:14.303]  This is what's happening to the men in our country.
[00:01:14.363 --> 00:01:15.624]  Where are the men?
[00:01:15.644 --> 00:01:17.085]  Stop touching my stuff.
[00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:18.066]  I'm backing away.
[00:01:18.447 --> 00:01:18.827]  Stop.
[00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.811]  Why are you doing that?
[00:01:25.832 --> 00:01:27.272]  Get the f***ing stuff in it!
[00:01:27.532 --> 00:01:28.693]  Don't film it!
[00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:30.213]  You're not allowed!
[00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:32.814]  You can't use it!
[00:01:32.874 --> 00:01:34.495]  Please do not touch me.
[00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:35.836]  Please do not touch me.
[00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:37.016]  Once again it's me.
[00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:38.857]  I actually sent both of you guys.
[00:01:38.957 --> 00:01:41.558]  Right beforehand you f***ing said, sir!
[00:01:41.758 --> 00:01:45.039]  If I have boobs drawn on my shirt, it's because I'm a liberated woman!
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.940]  I am!
[00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.290]  Motherf***er!
[00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.431]  Take it outside!
[00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:59.292]  If you don't call me sir again, I will show you no f***ing sir!
[00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:00.213]  Motherf***er!
[00:02:00.233 --> 00:02:03.554]  Get the f*** out of my face!
[00:02:03.574 --> 00:02:03.894]  Go home!
[00:02:03.914 --> 00:02:04.394]  Go home!
[00:02:04.474 --> 00:02:04.775]  Go home!
[00:02:04.795 --> 00:02:06.955]  What's your f***ing problem?
[00:02:06.975 --> 00:02:08.356]  Film it, bro.
[00:02:08.756 --> 00:02:09.196]  Film it.
[00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:10.397]  Yeah, I'm filming it.
[00:02:10.557 --> 00:02:14.478]  What the f*** did you do to me?
[00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:16.299]  Watch this.
[00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:19.060]  Are you farting at me?
[00:02:23.587 --> 00:02:25.448]  Get the hell out of here!
[00:02:25.468 --> 00:02:39.116]  Get these people the hell out of here right now!
[00:02:39.236 --> 00:02:39.836]  Fuck off!
[00:02:39.956 --> 00:02:41.477]  I don't give a fuck!
[00:02:41.797 --> 00:02:42.198]  Get out!
[00:02:42.258 --> 00:02:42.598]  Oh, shit!
[00:02:42.658 --> 00:02:43.098]  Please!
[00:02:43.238 --> 00:02:43.438]  Please!
[00:02:43.498 --> 00:02:43.959]  Please!
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.701]  you
[00:05:04.494 --> 00:05:11.099]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:19.886]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[00:05:25.546 --> 00:05:27.207]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[00:05:27.247 --> 00:05:28.208]  This is racketeering.
[00:05:28.468 --> 00:05:29.289]  This is cartels.
[00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:31.650]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.351]  We need it now.
[00:05:33.892 --> 00:05:35.152]  You can take on Big Tech.
[00:05:35.573 --> 00:05:43.938]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:52.324]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[00:05:52.564 --> 00:05:53.425]  The way to fight back
[00:05:54.025 --> 00:05:58.807]  ...is to support InfoWars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[00:05:58.888 --> 00:06:02.689]  Understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[00:06:08.032 --> 00:06:12.034]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:14.596 --> 00:06:18.518]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:26.098 --> 00:06:34.626]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:50.715 --> 00:06:52.596]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday, May 17, 2019.
[00:06:52.836 --> 00:06:56.059]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.840]  We're gonna be here for the next four hours.
[00:06:59.401 --> 00:07:00.301]  Well, it's happening.
[00:07:01.422 --> 00:07:12.049]  President Trump plans to invoke Insurrection Act to remove illegal aliens from the United States and secure the collapsed border that is under globalist and UN attack.
[00:07:13.422 --> 00:07:25.412]  This country is under globalist attack just like the European Union was established to attack the nation states and absorb them into a larger system of bankruptcy into a world government.
[00:07:26.413 --> 00:07:34.900]  And now this is the only act that the president can carry out that will have any chance of stopping what is unfolding.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.842]  They've built refugee centers all over Central and South America.
[00:07:38.523 --> 00:07:39.384]  They are bringing in
[00:07:41.135 --> 00:07:43.716]  Invaders from all over the world.
[00:07:43.756 --> 00:07:53.699]  In yesterday's stack, there was an article about 200 African invaders, called migrants, at the Texas border demanding to be let in.
[00:07:54.479 --> 00:08:00.741]  Over 100,000 a month are just released now into the United States.
[00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:04.122]  It's estimated five times that aren't even being caught.
[00:08:05.802 --> 00:08:10.304]  And many areas of the country now resemble giant open sewers.
[00:08:11.064 --> 00:08:15.386]  ICE to move 225,000 illegals across the country.
[00:08:16.787 --> 00:08:19.508]  Thousands more to South Florida.
[00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:23.289]  And that will only be the beginning.
[00:08:23.609 --> 00:08:27.431]  Millions and millions and millions are on their way.
[00:08:29.053 --> 00:08:32.074]  The full story's up on NewsWars.com.
[00:08:32.614 --> 00:08:35.635]  Trump plans to invoke Insurrection Act to boot illegal immigrants.
[00:08:35.675 --> 00:08:37.536]  But, you know, it's bigger than that headline.
[00:08:38.816 --> 00:08:40.677]  This is to secure our borders.
[00:08:42.378 --> 00:08:47.639]  You see the numbers where I says that on any given day, it's double the previous records.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.602]  And some days it's triple the previous records.
[00:08:55.162 --> 00:08:55.922]  I'm gonna say that again.
[00:08:56.643 --> 00:08:57.583]  On an average day,
[00:08:58.834 --> 00:09:06.236]  There are double the numbers of illegal aliens being caught coming in to the United States.
[00:09:07.476 --> 00:09:07.816]  Double.
[00:09:09.157 --> 00:09:10.477]  On any given day of the previous record.
[00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:15.798]  Some days it's triple the previous record.
[00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:20.420]  Mexico has some of the strongest immigration laws in the world.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.900]  Six months to a year hard labor if you get caught.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.781]  But that's only now if you try to stay.
[00:09:27.648 --> 00:09:48.373]  If you try to transit through Mexico, then you're allowed to come up and the United Nations gives them $1,000 debit cards, with no name on it, per leg of the trip to get here from Africa, from Europe, from Asia, from the Middle East, via Latin America.
[00:09:49.153 --> 00:09:55.595]  And now the dam has broken, the floodgates are wide open,
[00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:01.111]  And these individuals are pouring in, in mass.
[00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:07.052]  Upwards of 30% of the so-called families that get caught aren't families.
[00:10:07.672 --> 00:10:12.233]  They're adults smuggling children, in many cases, who've been kidnapped.
[00:10:12.974 --> 00:10:17.495]  Remember, when you fly into the U.S., they check your ID and make sure that your passport is real.
[00:10:18.475 --> 00:10:20.195]  They might ask you 30 seconds of questions.
[00:10:20.895 --> 00:10:22.576]  That's not against the Fourth Amendment.
[00:10:22.656 --> 00:10:23.676]  You're at a national border.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.284]  But then if you just cross illegally, you're loaded on buses and delivered to God knows where.
[00:10:32.225 --> 00:10:42.273]  And remember, the Senate's own report last year admitted many of the children that came across under Obama ended up in child sex slavery and were being trafficked.
[00:10:43.774 --> 00:10:47.037]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is an incredibly historic time to be alive.
[00:10:48.177 --> 00:10:58.020]  I've been encouraging Trump since last year to declare a national emergency as Commander-in-Chief and then he can direct the Defense Department money as he sees fit under that emergency.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.721]  Instead he declared a law enforcement emergency on funding to work with Congress.
[00:11:03.781 --> 00:11:06.062]  That's not a real national emergency.
[00:11:08.483 --> 00:11:16.765]  Dwight D. Eisenhower in the late 50s declared this emergency when millions were coming in illegally and deported them.
[00:11:18.325 --> 00:11:22.566]  No nation that doesn't control its borders is a nation any longer.
[00:11:23.726 --> 00:11:25.427]  So it's here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:26.647 --> 00:11:29.148]  What an incredible time to be alive.
[00:11:30.108 --> 00:11:37.370]  This is being reported by very reputable publications like Daily Caller that have reporters inside the White House.
[00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:42.970]  And the president has floated the idea and it says he's getting ready to do it.
[00:11:43.631 --> 00:11:50.721]  President Trump plans to invoke Insurrection Act, so it's happening, to remove illegal aliens and secure the borders of the United States.
[00:11:51.201 --> 00:11:53.344]  President Trump is planning on invoking Insurrection Act.
[00:11:54.286 --> 00:11:56.288]  The Daily Caller's Amber Athey reported.
[00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:07.212]  That multiple senior Trump administration officials said President Trump will soon invoke the tremendous powers, close quote, of the Act to get rid of illegal aliens leeching off the fat of the land.
[00:12:07.632 --> 00:12:09.653]  We're doing the Insurrection Act, one official said.
[00:12:10.193 --> 00:12:21.535]  Under the Insurrection Act of 1807, the President has the authority to use the National Guard and military in order to combat unlawful obstruction or rebellion.
[00:12:23.311 --> 00:12:24.573]  What do you have with the Democratic Party?
[00:12:25.334 --> 00:12:29.540]  Sanctuary cities telling ICE, telling MS-13 when ICE is coming.
[00:12:30.621 --> 00:12:32.083]  This is the breakdown of civilization.
[00:12:32.103 --> 00:12:32.965]  This is the breakdown of law.
[00:12:33.325 --> 00:12:37.791]  This is the left and the globalists creating anarchy, which is the absence of law.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:48.227]  Marshall Law is the institution of emergency rule overriding regular law because regular law can no longer be enforced.
[00:12:48.648 --> 00:12:50.069]  I'm an expert on Marshall Law.
[00:12:50.489 --> 00:12:59.197]  I've made four films on Marshall Law because Bill Clinton and others were planning Marshall Law to take our guns using people rioting nationwide as the pretext.
[00:13:00.831 --> 00:13:11.574]  This is civil emergency martial law to counter the emergency that the globalists have already brought us into, and only an emergency can counter that.
[00:13:11.914 --> 00:13:13.394]  Remember all the documents we got last year?
[00:13:13.954 --> 00:13:18.156]  Antifa is planning to trigger a race war and martial law nationwide.
[00:13:18.196 --> 00:13:23.477]  That's what Netflix and Hollywood and ABC and NBC and CBS and CNN and MSNBC, it's all
[00:13:23.917 --> 00:13:24.697]  Race, race, race.
[00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:25.658]  Race, race, race.
[00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:26.458]  No borders.
[00:13:26.658 --> 00:13:27.119]  No wall.
[00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:28.359]  No USA at all.
[00:13:28.619 --> 00:13:30.160]  Having a border, period, is evil.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.921]  Everybody else can have one, but we can't.
[00:13:34.462 --> 00:13:39.044]  So again, when we come back, I'll get into the act itself.
[00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:47.008]  We've posted the full act up on InfoWars.com, in the live broadcast page today.
[00:13:48.097 --> 00:13:58.890]  We're also going to get into remarks by the President and the latest with ICE and what's unfolding on all of those fronts today.
[00:13:59.912 --> 00:14:01.554]  But continuing, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:10.603]  This is a incredible time to be alive and to be pushed into this situation.
[00:14:11.204 --> 00:14:13.625]  We'll be going over 10 U.S.
[00:14:13.705 --> 00:14:20.768]  Code 252, use of militia and armed forces to enforce federal authority.
[00:14:20.988 --> 00:14:27.031]  Under the Insurrection Act 1807, the President has the authority to use the National Guard and military in order to combat
[00:14:27.975 --> 00:14:29.636]  Unlawful obstruction or rebellion.
[00:14:30.317 --> 00:14:30.958]  Within U.S.
[00:14:31.018 --> 00:14:33.920]  borders, the act was first invoked in 1992.
[00:14:35.361 --> 00:14:39.605]  It was also done similarly by Eisenhower, by George H.W.
[00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:41.066]  Bush to quell Los Angeles riots.
[00:14:41.606 --> 00:14:47.291]  It was also used by Eisenhower 57 to enforce school desegregation in the South.
[00:14:47.952 --> 00:14:54.157]  So when you have local governments violating federal law, state governments violating federal law, or foreign groups inside violating federal law,
[00:14:55.609 --> 00:15:02.752]  You either stand up to it or the federalist system is over because the federal government is advocating its authority and handed it over.
[00:15:04.213 --> 00:15:10.776]  So this is a classical time to use this when there are attempts to implode the nation state from without and from within.
[00:15:10.796 --> 00:15:14.497]  So we will go over all of this when we return on the other side.
[00:15:14.517 --> 00:15:17.258]  But obviously the left is going to oppose this.
[00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:17.999]  They're going to claim
[00:15:19.762 --> 00:15:21.103]  That Trump's trying to be a dictator.
[00:15:22.083 --> 00:15:26.905]  They're going to claim that anybody that's here needs to be given all the money they want and all the free stuff they want.
[00:15:28.465 --> 00:15:31.407]  Accelerating the collapse of the country.
[00:15:32.127 --> 00:15:33.087]  What has Beto said?
[00:15:33.127 --> 00:15:34.188]  What has AOC said?
[00:15:34.748 --> 00:15:35.988]  What has de Blasio said?
[00:15:36.008 --> 00:15:39.950]  They all say you deserve everything free even if you don't want to work.
[00:15:40.686 --> 00:15:48.870]  In the new Green Deal that Sanders is pushing, everything is free except for the people we're going to enslave to pay for you to sit on your fat ass.
[00:15:49.311 --> 00:15:52.692]  But of course, once the globalists have imploded the country, no one will get anything free.
[00:15:53.013 --> 00:15:55.734]  We'll be like Venezuela, engaging in cannibalism.
[00:15:55.754 --> 00:15:57.015]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:15:57.275 --> 00:15:58.135]  Historic Times.
[00:15:58.355 --> 00:15:58.776]  Stay with us.
[00:16:07.188 --> 00:16:11.109]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.350]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.170]  Good to talk to you.
[00:16:14.511 --> 00:16:18.672]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[00:16:18.892 --> 00:16:20.633]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[00:16:20.733 --> 00:16:25.114]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[00:16:25.334 --> 00:16:27.235]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[00:16:27.315 --> 00:16:31.656]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate that.
[00:16:31.756 --> 00:16:33.217]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[00:16:33.257 --> 00:16:33.797]  Tell us about it.
[00:16:33.817 --> 00:16:34.517]  Well, it's really great.
[00:16:34.537 --> 00:16:35.758]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[00:16:35.798 --> 00:16:36.238]  I take it.
[00:16:36.278 --> 00:16:36.898]  It tastes good.
[00:16:36.978 --> 00:16:38.659]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[00:16:38.739 --> 00:16:40.420]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.061]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[00:16:43.081 --> 00:16:43.862]  So I really like it.
[00:16:43.902 --> 00:16:46.543]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[00:16:46.603 --> 00:16:48.144]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[00:16:48.264 --> 00:16:50.145]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[00:16:50.245 --> 00:16:50.745]  So, yeah.
[00:16:51.105 --> 00:16:52.966]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[00:16:53.426 --> 00:16:55.767]  These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force.
[00:16:56.107 --> 00:16:57.048]  So I'm glad you plugged it.

[00:17:39.711 --> 00:17:42.634]  But they said, look, when you do Plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[00:17:42.774 --> 00:17:43.454]  Just call it Ultra 12.
[00:17:43.534 --> 00:17:44.195]  Well, you know what?
[00:17:44.255 --> 00:17:45.476]  I don't like how the label's printed.
[00:17:45.556 --> 00:17:47.538]  And it just so happens it had already been labeled with the other one.
[00:17:47.558 --> 00:17:48.439]  We decided to change the name.
[00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:49.740]  So when you peel off the label,
[00:17:50.939 --> 00:17:54.380]  Underneath it, it's secret 12 plus.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.300]  Twice as strong, 50% off right now.

[00:19:07.222 --> 00:19:08.002]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[00:19:08.102 --> 00:19:09.402]  You are the man, Alex.
[00:19:09.462 --> 00:19:10.863]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[00:19:10.963 --> 00:19:11.723]  I'm so excited.
[00:19:11.763 --> 00:19:12.603]  I'm such a big fan.
[00:19:12.683 --> 00:19:15.084]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[00:19:15.164 --> 00:19:17.605]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[00:19:17.665 --> 00:19:18.345]  The Bone Broth.
[00:19:19.085 --> 00:19:19.925]  The Bone Broth.
[00:19:20.525 --> 00:19:21.446]  The Bone Broth.
[00:19:21.686 --> 00:19:22.826]  The Bone Broth.
[00:19:23.166 --> 00:19:27.668]  Tastes like, tastes like a great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[00:19:27.928 --> 00:19:29.288]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:19:29.368 --> 00:19:30.709]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:31.909]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:35.631]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[00:19:35.731 --> 00:19:39.434]  My daughter uses the Bubble Gum Fluoride 3 Toothpaste.
[00:19:39.914 --> 00:19:43.676]  I've used the Super Male Vitality, a host of other products.
[00:19:43.716 --> 00:19:45.417]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[00:19:45.738 --> 00:19:48.279]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products.
[00:19:48.299 --> 00:19:49.000]  I'm thanking you.
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:55.244]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[00:19:55.504 --> 00:19:56.284]  It is next level.
[00:19:56.324 --> 00:19:56.885]  It really is good.
[00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:57.305]  So thank you.
[00:19:57.445 --> 00:19:59.246]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[00:19:59.386 --> 00:19:59.767]  Thank you.
[00:20:06.869 --> 00:20:11.431]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:28.276 --> 00:20:28.957]  Think about this.
[00:20:30.117 --> 00:20:35.599]  Think about how there have been attempts to suspend common sense and logic
[00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:39.499]  There are 800 million people in Latin America.
[00:20:40.359 --> 00:20:44.220]  There are billions in other parts of the third world.
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:53.362]  And the UN and George Soros, from the Middle East to Africa, to Latin America, to Asia, are paying for plane tickets.
[00:20:54.942 --> 00:21:03.584]  And are giving people $1,000 debit cards, with no one's name on it, for each leg of the trip.
[00:21:03.604 --> 00:21:05.505]  And when they show up at the next refugee center,
[00:21:07.244 --> 00:21:14.370]  They're giving bags of food, local cash, and $1,000 more.
[00:21:16.432 --> 00:21:32.785]  And I have mainline news admitting that there are hundreds of thousands of people now pouring in out of Canada, from Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East, with paid-for airline tickets by the UN with U.S.
[00:21:32.825 --> 00:21:33.626]  taxpayer money.
[00:21:34.107 --> 00:21:35.408]  This is war.
[00:21:37.864 --> 00:21:57.856]  Lou Dobbs talked about it six months ago, and Fox announced that the head of Judicial Watch that was on was banned for the hateful statement that George Soros is involved, when George Soros is on the cover of Reuters articles two years ago, saying he's, quote, giving his money to it.
[00:21:57.956 --> 00:21:58.877]  Yeah, he gets U.S.
[00:21:59.157 --> 00:21:59.678]  aid money.
[00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:03.440]  He launders it, keeps part of it, and then funds it.
[00:22:05.285 --> 00:22:06.566]  And what did Lou Dobbs' guest say?
[00:22:06.846 --> 00:22:10.787]  There should be criminal charges against Soros for saying the sky's blue!
[00:22:12.268 --> 00:22:13.789]  Well, he may have to be banned.
[00:22:14.229 --> 00:22:22.392]  Apprehensions up 42% on the northern border as Mexican Central Americans try to enter the U.S.
[00:22:22.452 --> 00:22:23.133]  from Canada.
[00:22:25.634 --> 00:22:29.756]  ICE to hire a contractor to transport 225,000 migrants to shelters across the U.S.
[00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.613]  They're gonna dump out large numbers of them, starting in South Florida.
[00:22:37.453 --> 00:22:44.038]  And imagine, your little town, your city, just like in Germany, where you hear about a town of 100 people might get 800, quote, migrants.
[00:22:44.739 --> 00:22:50.083]  And people are saying, hey, Ann Coulter's saying, hey, Trump, things are worse under you.
[00:22:50.223 --> 00:22:51.985]  You're behind it.
[00:22:52.345 --> 00:22:53.506]  Ann Coulter's not stupid.
[00:22:55.925 --> 00:23:03.451]  Ann Coulter knows that Obama and the UN cranked all this up eight, nine years ago and called everybody invading children, even though they were less than 7%.
[00:23:04.012 --> 00:23:13.039]  And Ann Coulter knows that less than 10% ever show up to their court hearings about asylum.
[00:23:15.083 --> 00:23:18.346]  And the average waits four years for your asylum.
[00:23:18.606 --> 00:23:20.127]  So our system's broken.
[00:23:20.587 --> 00:23:21.408]  We're overwhelmed.
[00:23:21.668 --> 00:23:22.769]  The courts are overwhelmed.
[00:23:23.109 --> 00:23:25.171]  The most open system in the world is broken.
[00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:25.911]  We're full.
[00:23:27.953 --> 00:23:31.075]  And now if they don't stop the next phase, we'll have a totally broken country.
[00:23:31.336 --> 00:23:33.137]  Just like Europe is now a crap hole.
[00:23:33.698 --> 00:23:34.318]  Tourism's down 80%.
[00:23:35.259 --> 00:23:36.460]  Human feces everywhere.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:43.025]  You'll be driving through the forest in France or Germany and trees fall down in front of you and just people run out like
[00:23:44.306 --> 00:23:47.769]  Into the world, road warrior, and just grab you, rape you, and you're just found dead.
[00:23:48.629 --> 00:23:49.950]  And it's just a little blurb in the news.
[00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.392]  And if you complain, the police come and arrest you.
[00:23:54.474 --> 00:23:57.616]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the world government invasion.
[00:23:57.836 --> 00:23:59.677]  Eighty-plus percent military-age men.
[00:24:00.158 --> 00:24:02.299]  Now, 15 million of them in Europe, conservatively.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.621]  And they're coming here.
[00:24:05.041 --> 00:24:06.422]  And the no-go zone's everywhere.
[00:24:06.963 --> 00:24:08.744]  They don't even have third-grade educations.
[00:24:09.685 --> 00:24:10.645]  But they know one thing.
[00:24:10.906 --> 00:24:12.507]  Women are dogs and are to be beaten.
[00:24:13.697 --> 00:24:19.598]  Women are the lowest form of garbage under these third-world Islamic countries.
[00:24:20.419 --> 00:24:21.459]  And so it's on, folks!
[00:24:22.219 --> 00:24:24.080]  It's on, the collapse of civilization.
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.160]  And so, what is Trump running?
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.120]  The only thing he can do.
[00:24:28.561 --> 00:24:37.963]  He did the first emergency, it was just a congressional oversight issue of funding, and Trump's saying he can use some discretionary funds outside of Congress with law enforcement.
[00:24:38.323 --> 00:24:39.883]  That's not a full emergency.
[00:24:40.424 --> 00:24:41.784]  And yes, it's a form of martial law.
[00:24:42.634 --> 00:24:43.775]  Our laws are suspended.
[00:24:44.036 --> 00:24:45.217]  The laws are all violated.
[00:24:45.497 --> 00:24:46.198]  It's anarchy.
[00:24:46.558 --> 00:24:48.020]  Anarchy is the absence of law.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.201]  Law of the jungle.
[00:24:49.501 --> 00:24:56.408]  So when you have anarchy and collapse, and regular government can't function anymore, martial law is instituted.
[00:24:56.808 --> 00:24:58.270]  Martial meaning military.
[00:25:01.101 --> 00:25:02.262]  So, I'm gonna explain it again.
[00:25:02.282 --> 00:25:14.889]  If a dam broke and your town's in a valley and it flooded everything with 10 feet of water and killed half the town, your town's gonna be put under an emergency by the governor, a form of martial law to stop looting for a week or two.
[00:25:16.169 --> 00:25:18.531]  That's because of an emergency that wasn't man-made.
[00:25:19.031 --> 00:25:20.712]  This is man-made.
[00:25:21.372 --> 00:25:24.154]  And when Trump declares this, which there's certainly he's about to do,
[00:25:26.923 --> 00:25:28.963]  He's going to have the left claiming he's a dictator.
[00:25:29.323 --> 00:25:30.824]  No, you're the ones that broke the border.
[00:25:32.564 --> 00:25:36.165]  You're the ones that rape 80% of the women that transverse Mexico into the U.S.
[00:25:36.565 --> 00:25:37.345]  Amnesty International.
[00:25:37.645 --> 00:25:39.746]  You're the ones working with MS-13 Democrats.
[00:25:40.306 --> 00:25:41.806]  You're the ones saying they're all God's children.
[00:25:42.066 --> 00:25:46.707]  You're the ones that did this, that let the world know we're broken, we're wide open, we're screwed.
[00:25:48.267 --> 00:25:51.068]  We are now in a form of anarchy at our borders.
[00:25:51.908 --> 00:25:52.908]  We have been overrun.
[00:25:53.328 --> 00:25:56.409]  We have been broken in the eyes of the world, just like Europe.
[00:25:57.867 --> 00:26:03.353]  And it took Europe five years to finally start putting troops on the borders without the EU's consent.
[00:26:03.594 --> 00:26:06.477]  Austria, Hungary, Romania, Poland.
[00:26:06.878 --> 00:26:10.642]  And the UN's trying to militarily stop them now.
[00:26:14.286 --> 00:26:15.648]  But to add insult to injury.
[00:26:17.679 --> 00:26:26.402]  Cory Booker and all the usual suspects have said when Trump came out and said, oh, we'll just ship these people that by law, because the courts are overwhelmed, we can't ship back.
[00:26:27.062 --> 00:26:27.902]  We have to dump them out.
[00:26:28.022 --> 00:26:30.043]  We're going to dump them out in your district, Cory.
[00:26:30.943 --> 00:26:32.624]  And Cory said, that's very dangerous.
[00:26:32.944 --> 00:26:33.624]  You can't do that.
[00:26:33.924 --> 00:26:35.885]  Oh, well, where are we supposed to dump them then?
[00:26:37.225 --> 00:26:37.765]  Think about that.
[00:26:40.906 --> 00:26:42.147]  It's double what it's ever been.
[00:26:43.208 --> 00:26:48.412]  Now the world knows it'll be 5 times, 10 times, 20 times, 30 times, 40 times!
[00:26:50.995 --> 00:26:52.055]  You will be the third world.
[00:26:52.256 --> 00:26:52.976]  It will be over.
[00:26:53.757 --> 00:26:54.337]  Very soon.
[00:26:54.578 --> 00:26:58.401]  But the President is set to declare 10 U.S.
[00:26:58.461 --> 00:27:04.025]  Code 252, use of militia armed forces to enforce federal authority.
[00:27:05.166 --> 00:27:05.667]  It's happening.
[00:27:07.304 --> 00:27:09.766]  It's going on, and the Democrats brought us here.
[00:27:10.387 --> 00:27:13.610]  President Trump planned to invoke the Insurrection Act to remove illegal aliens from the United States.
[00:27:14.151 --> 00:27:18.275]  Here's Cory Booker, though, saying it's very dangerous to dump them off in his town.
[00:27:19.841 --> 00:27:25.564]  Do you think this is an empty threat by the president, though, to talk about busing people from the border into these sanctuary cities?
[00:27:25.584 --> 00:27:29.927]  He likes to create friction sometimes to jumpstart, he says, a Congress that's not active.
[00:27:29.947 --> 00:27:36.211]  You say friction, I say he's trying to pit Americans against each other and make us less safe, because what you're seeing now... So you take the threat seriously?
[00:27:37.251 --> 00:27:37.812]  I take this.
[00:27:38.332 --> 00:27:39.613]  He's injecting fear
[00:27:40.613 --> 00:27:41.334]  Into our country.
[00:27:41.535 --> 00:27:45.920]  And so if he was looking to solve a problem, he wouldn't be doing things to divide this country against itself.
[00:27:47.322 --> 00:27:58.397]  Beware of anybody that's trying to tell you to be afraid in the strongest country in the world, as opposed to showing our strength and our courage by pulling people together to find common sense solutions to solve this problem.
[00:27:58.888 --> 00:28:02.070]  Which is to legalize anybody that can get here to encourage even more.
[00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:04.651]  But don't bring them to the Democrats' towns, bring them to your town.
[00:28:05.451 --> 00:28:07.493]  That's where the Democrats actually ship them, to red cities.
[00:28:07.913 --> 00:28:08.673]  It's a big joke.
[00:28:08.973 --> 00:28:09.854]  It's a form of warfare.
[00:28:10.214 --> 00:28:12.915]  No, they're coming to your San Francisco.
[00:28:13.496 --> 00:28:14.616]  They're coming to your L.A.
[00:28:14.656 --> 00:28:16.017]  They're coming to your Chicago.
[00:28:16.257 --> 00:28:17.738]  They're coming to your Detroit.
[00:28:18.018 --> 00:28:19.999]  They're coming to your Baltimore.
[00:28:20.179 --> 00:28:21.540]  They're coming to your D.C.
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.922]  They're coming to your New York City, buddy boy.
[00:28:26.343 --> 00:28:28.785]  Tommy Robinson is on fire fighting the tyrants.
[00:28:28.825 --> 00:28:30.046]  He joins us live coming up.
[00:28:30.086 --> 00:28:31.927]  He's running for European Parliament and more.

[00:28:56.241 --> 00:28:57.622]  That special is about to end.
[00:28:57.662 --> 00:29:00.343]  Your free bottle of Tri-Iodine X3.
[00:29:12.185 --> 00:29:19.649]  Larry C. Johnson, without going through your whole bio, distinguished CIA, counterterrorism expert, run major operations, you're a respected guy and a patriot.
[00:29:19.829 --> 00:29:25.713]  What would you call this period we're in and now that the deep state or criminal elements of it have failed, where we're going here?
[00:29:25.953 --> 00:29:31.116]  The intelligence community and the law enforcement community have been weaponized against a domestic
[00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:34.438]  It's that simple.
[00:29:34.798 --> 00:29:44.824]  We've really never experienced in our history where these tools of government were turned on the opposing political party in such an intense way.
[00:29:44.984 --> 00:29:50.047]  You know, people will disparage Trump for calling it a coup, but I don't know what else you can call it.
[00:29:50.507 --> 00:30:01.295]  This is exactly a failed coup attempt, and people like Jim Clapper, John Brennan, Jim Comey, and Loretta Lynch, Susan Rice, they were all involved, all implicated.
[00:30:01.595 --> 00:30:10.901]  And they're trying to pretend now that they were just looking for the bad deeds of Russians who just happened to stumble across all these Trump people, which is just a lie.
[00:30:11.021 --> 00:30:13.383]  The other point, though, I think you correctly know is
[00:30:13.843 --> 00:30:15.744]  This didn't just start with Donald Trump.
[00:30:15.824 --> 00:30:19.565]  It started, you yourself have experienced this persecution.
[00:30:19.965 --> 00:30:23.886]  We saw that James Rosen of Fox News was being spied upon.
[00:30:24.266 --> 00:30:26.287]  Other journalists were being spied upon.
[00:30:26.607 --> 00:30:30.148]  So this is something that the Obama administration started doing early on.
[00:30:31.128 --> 00:30:37.672]  And then it just, they got so used to doing it and getting away with it, it just escalated and expanded dramatically.
[00:30:38.032 --> 00:30:45.677]  Then, when, you know, it went through phases with Trump, because in the initial phase of the Trump campaign, nobody thought he was going to win.
[00:30:45.797 --> 00:30:52.261]  And then, when it looked like Trump was going to get the nomination, then it entered another phase, even more intense.
[00:30:52.801 --> 00:30:54.122]  And this starts about March of 2016.
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:05.665]  And you can see, that's when Perkins Coie hires Fusion GPS, and Christopher Steele is brought on to do the dossier.
[00:31:05.986 --> 00:31:10.248]  That's the time period they start going intensively after Papadopoulos.
[00:31:10.308 --> 00:31:13.070]  That's the time frame when they start going after Carter Page.
[00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:15.751]  So this had a sort of a natural progression.
[00:31:15.831 --> 00:31:18.833]  And then phase three comes when Trump stuns them.
[00:31:18.873 --> 00:31:20.094]  Because I know for a fact
[00:31:20.314 --> 00:31:27.696]  ...from a friend who was present in some conversations between Clapper and Brennan, that they genuinely did not believe that Trump would win.
[00:31:27.836 --> 00:31:31.337]  And they were even counseled by the FBI to don't be so certain of that.
[00:31:31.457 --> 00:31:40.800]  So what they counted on was they could justify their actions as a counterintelligence investigation because they had, quote, intelligence that was leading them to do this.
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:48.902]  But what they didn't admit to is that that intelligence was actually produced in response to requests from the Clinton campaign initially.
[00:31:49.262 --> 00:32:01.876]  And people affiliated with the Clinton campaign to come up and start doing opposition research on Donald Trump, but then to add the sort of the added flavor of having it appear as if it was legitimate intelligence.
[00:32:02.036 --> 00:32:08.222]  So going back almost 30 years, I have never seen such a dishonest display.
[00:32:08.442 --> 00:32:11.606]  I mean, deliberate dishonesty on the part of media types.
[00:32:12.286 --> 00:32:18.268]  Uh, and particularly at MSNBC and at CNN, but it's really going throughout the media.
[00:32:18.708 --> 00:32:21.850]  No one's actually trying to be honest about covering the stories.
[00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:23.890]  Now, the saving grace is this.
[00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:31.373]  Talk radio, like your show and like Rush Limbaugh's show, if you compare Rush Limbaugh's show to all the major media,
[00:32:32.151 --> 00:32:40.998]  As many people listen to Rush Limbaugh as watch ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News on any given night.
[00:32:41.118 --> 00:32:41.819]  Think about that.
[00:32:42.159 --> 00:32:46.662]  Your show and other shows, it gets out there and it counters the argument.
[00:32:46.802 --> 00:32:47.803]  They can't control it.
[00:32:47.823 --> 00:32:49.084]  They want to try to control it.
[00:32:49.425 --> 00:32:56.130]  The way they try to control it is by destroying you, by destroying your reputation, and by trying to characterize you as a complete crack.
[00:33:06.443 --> 00:33:09.084]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:25.425 --> 00:33:29.467]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:33:30.248 --> 00:33:31.708]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:31.949 --> 00:33:33.069]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:33.609 --> 00:33:38.352]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:39.112 --> 00:33:39.753]  It's happening.
[00:33:40.413 --> 00:33:48.237]  President Trump is set to invoke Insurrection Act and remove illegal aliens from the United States and secure our borders.
[00:33:48.317 --> 00:33:52.500]  We are in a form of anarchy induced by the previous administration.
[00:33:53.539 --> 00:34:01.346]  Run by the United Nations, funded by criminals in our State Department, and Trump has been cutting that funding out right now.
[00:34:01.406 --> 00:34:04.489]  He's finally getting some control over the executive branch.
[00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:11.015]  This is an amazing time to be alive, and you can imagine the responses we're going to see from the Democrats.
[00:34:11.636 --> 00:34:12.116]  We're good to go.
[00:34:33.046 --> 00:34:35.668]  That he hasn't done this in the last two years when Congress wouldn't act.
[00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:42.593]  I'm not attacking the President, I'm just saying it's his job to do this and this is what he should do.
[00:34:43.574 --> 00:34:45.135]  But all hell is going to break loose.
[00:34:45.555 --> 00:34:53.121]  Documents came out two weeks ago that Antifa, working with MS-13, is planning and targeting law enforcement for assassinations on the border.
[00:34:53.601 --> 00:34:55.103]  They openly talk about this.
[00:34:55.683 --> 00:35:05.992]  They had the founder of Antifa on the Young Turks on Monday saying that we want a violent overthrow of the government and they said that we're preparing the revolution now.
[00:35:07.393 --> 00:35:08.274]  What, overthrow it?
[00:35:08.314 --> 00:35:13.198]  Just open the border up and bankrupt everything and bring in 500 million people promising them free stuff?
[00:35:13.559 --> 00:35:15.200]  The UN wants 600 million.
[00:35:17.096 --> 00:35:19.918]  People in the next 30 years to the United States.
[00:35:20.459 --> 00:35:21.079]  Sounds crazy.
[00:35:21.139 --> 00:35:23.761]  The same UN group wants 250 million in Europe.
[00:35:24.102 --> 00:35:25.863]  Macron says he agrees with that.
[00:35:27.604 --> 00:35:31.708]  And of course, Cuomo on CNN says Antifa is a good cause.
[00:35:32.328 --> 00:35:39.634]  Now, Tommy Robinson, of course, is a human rights activist, a journalist, a political prisoner, he's been tortured, you name it.
[00:35:40.495 --> 00:35:44.378]  He's been battling for his free speech, just like we're battling for ours here.
[00:35:44.918 --> 00:35:45.518]  I don't
[00:36:04.504 --> 00:36:12.452]  About where he is, what he's doing today, and what he thinks of Trump signaling he's preparing to basically declare martial law to secure the borders.
[00:36:12.892 --> 00:36:15.855]  The crisis is so bad here now, just like Europe, Tommy.
[00:36:17.917 --> 00:36:18.477]  How are you, Alex?
[00:36:18.498 --> 00:36:18.778]  You alright?
[00:36:19.679 --> 00:36:21.060]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.422]  Give us the latest in Europe, the latest happening to you.
[00:36:24.183 --> 00:36:26.545]  You're leading in some polls, running for office.
[00:36:26.565 --> 00:36:27.146]  Tell us about that.
[00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:31.773]  So I'm standing as a Member of the European Parliament for the North West of England.
[00:36:32.894 --> 00:36:37.579]  Since I started my campaign, I've been physically assaulted multiple times in front of the police.
[00:36:38.159 --> 00:36:39.861]  The police have refused to make any arrests.
[00:36:39.881 --> 00:36:41.022]  You can see the video footage of it.
[00:36:41.302 --> 00:36:43.224]  There's footage of me having a milkshake thrown over my head.
[00:36:43.744 --> 00:36:48.669]  Once I had the milkshake thrown over my head, the police actually dropped the Muslim man that done it at the train station.
[00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:50.391]  Again, no arrests have been made.
[00:36:51.832 --> 00:36:56.014]  I've now, as you know, as we all know, we've been removed from all social media.
[00:36:56.034 --> 00:36:58.014]  So my ability to fight a fair election has gone.
[00:36:58.435 --> 00:37:03.717]  We then set up Twitter handles under the campaign name, nothing to do with me.
[00:37:04.197 --> 00:37:05.118]  They've been deleted.
[00:37:05.538 --> 00:37:08.560]  And then yesterday, Stripe deleted our account.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.382]  Stripe, the company that process payments for your credit card.
[00:37:13.782 --> 00:37:17.564]  Now, everyone knows you can't win an election without funding, without support.
[00:37:18.244 --> 00:37:19.586]  We're already behind everyone.
[00:37:19.846 --> 00:37:22.329]  We don't have the same advantage as everyone because we don't have social media.
[00:37:22.669 --> 00:37:24.811]  We can't reach or speak to the public.
[00:37:25.192 --> 00:37:26.493]  So we're already fighting a different battle.
[00:37:27.256 --> 00:37:29.257]  But now they've removed our ability to even raise funds.
[00:37:29.537 --> 00:37:37.078]  They removed it yesterday, and then we got a lawyer to contact them to say they are meddling in an election process, and they've reinstated it for 14 days.
[00:37:37.118 --> 00:37:47.781]  But in 14 days, I'll be removed from Strife as well, just like all the other platforms, having committed no crime, having promoted no hate, just for speaking the facts and embarrassing the government, embarrassing the establishment.
[00:37:48.281 --> 00:37:55.143]  But our election over here is on the 23rd of May, and I hope it goes like a lightning bolt into the heart of that establishment when I win.
[00:37:56.345 --> 00:37:58.106]  We're seeing really exciting things.
[00:37:58.446 --> 00:38:04.989]  There's the Brexit movement, there's obviously UKIP, and then you've got all these other populist movements.
[00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:12.313]  Some polls show the populist movements winning half the seats in this election in the European Parliament.
[00:38:12.633 --> 00:38:13.514]  What numbers are you seeing?
[00:38:15.456 --> 00:38:18.599]  Yeah, I think the Brexit Party will clean up in this election.
[00:38:18.819 --> 00:38:24.103]  I wish it was you keep cleaning up, not the Brexit Party, because I think that the Brexit Party are more of the same.
[00:38:24.564 --> 00:38:28.287]  When the Brexit Party started, which is Nigel Farage's party, three of them formed it.
[00:38:28.863 --> 00:38:33.505]  The lady had to resign because she retweeted me, so Nigel Farage forced her to resign.
[00:38:33.905 --> 00:38:39.587]  The second man was fired as well for making unpolitically correct comments.
[00:38:40.027 --> 00:38:42.968]  Then the AM that you just showed there, he supported me.
[00:38:43.769 --> 00:38:46.050]  Nigel Farage has got rid of him.
[00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:57.554]  Nigel Farage is brilliant on Europe, but when it comes to speaking about real issues that affect us in our towns and cities, when it comes to issues about being honest about Islam and problems that it causes, Nigel Farage is a coward like the rest of us.
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.121]  Well, we know what happens.
[00:38:59.141 --> 00:39:07.548]  I mean, they ran BBC TV pieces last week and Guardian articles saying Nigel Farage is a Nazi because he went on Alex Jones, the Nazi show.
[00:39:07.868 --> 00:39:09.410]  Well, that's defamation, defamation.
[00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:10.410]  But I agree.
[00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:11.211]  I like Nigel.
[00:39:11.231 --> 00:39:12.492]  He helped found UKIP.
[00:39:12.512 --> 00:39:13.433]  He's done some great things.
[00:39:13.853 --> 00:39:16.395]  But more and more, he's giving in to their lies.
[00:39:16.836 --> 00:39:18.317]  Everyone knows we're not Nazis.
[00:39:18.597 --> 00:39:20.038]  Everyone knows he's not a Nazi.
[00:39:20.639 --> 00:39:21.380]  But regardless,
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:29.184]  The fact that his new populist party is exploding in one year to the number one position has got to scare the living hell out of the establishment.
[00:39:30.525 --> 00:39:34.927]  Yeah, I think it will, but he has resorted to the same labelling that's been thrown at him.
[00:39:35.307 --> 00:39:36.248]  He's been called a racist.
[00:39:36.268 --> 00:39:36.848]  We know he's not.
[00:39:36.888 --> 00:39:38.309]  He's been called a racist and extremist.
[00:39:38.609 --> 00:39:44.573]  He's then resorted to calling everyone else racist and extremist and trying to distance himself to make himself look like the moderate, clean character.
[00:39:44.893 --> 00:39:46.554]  He has thrown everyone else under the bus.
[00:39:46.974 --> 00:39:48.235]  He called all of my supporters.
[00:39:48.375 --> 00:39:50.516]  All of my supporters, he said, were tattooed bugs.
[00:39:51.076 --> 00:39:53.298]  Which is just not true, and he knows it's not true.
[00:39:53.738 --> 00:39:56.561]  So it's sad to watch someone like him resort to political correctness.
[00:39:56.581 --> 00:40:02.786]  Well sure, and that's kind of an elitist statement because most of the military, especially I know in the UK and in Europe, has tattoos.
[00:40:02.806 --> 00:40:04.347]  So are we saying the military's bad?
[00:40:05.965 --> 00:40:07.767]  No, no, all that is is classism.
[00:40:07.807 --> 00:40:08.548]  Nigel's classism.
[00:40:08.588 --> 00:40:12.171]  Nigel has never been into a working class estate in Britain in his life.
[00:40:12.872 --> 00:40:14.173]  He's not one of us, OK?
[00:40:14.393 --> 00:40:22.181]  He's just another city toff, another rich multimillionaire from a privately educated... He is part of the establishment problem that we need to cure.
[00:40:22.701 --> 00:40:23.662]  He's part of it now.
[00:40:23.682 --> 00:40:29.306]  Yeah, he's great on Europe and in fact he held a pint of beer which was to fool most of our people to thinking he's one of us.
[00:40:29.706 --> 00:40:32.168]  In the last 12 months we've seen his classism show himself.
[00:40:32.548 --> 00:40:40.214]  Obviously in America you don't have the classist issues that we have but we do and Nigel views us the same way they all view us and that's become apparent.
[00:40:40.474 --> 00:40:46.278]  That's not to take away the amazing... He's dedicated 30 years of his life to fighting the dictatorship in Europe.
[00:40:46.738 --> 00:40:48.761]  I don't want to talk about you, but look front and center.
[00:40:48.781 --> 00:40:49.742]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:40:49.922 --> 00:40:51.364]  It's on Newswars.com.
[00:40:51.384 --> 00:40:54.027]  As you said, they're fighting to shut us all down together.
[00:40:54.087 --> 00:41:00.335]  That's why people, word of mouth, support, prayer, letters, whatever, is not just needed, it's essential.
[00:41:00.735 --> 00:41:02.738]  But the beautiful, wonderful, black,
[00:41:03.318 --> 00:41:04.099]  Candace Owens.
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:10.065]  Facebook suspends Candace Owens for saying liberal policies incentivize fatherless homes.
[00:41:10.546 --> 00:41:14.670]  And she went on to say that the real plantation is Democrats breaking up black families.
[00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:16.832]  They've now banned her for that.
[00:41:17.292 --> 00:41:20.275]  I mean, now a black woman can't say what's historically true.
[00:41:20.816 --> 00:41:23.298]  It's out of control what big tech is doing.
[00:41:23.358 --> 00:41:25.621]  They are election meddling everywhere, Tommy.
[00:41:27.032 --> 00:41:33.018]  If someone put their vote form on the other day where they ticked Tommy Robinson and they shared it, it got removed for going against their policies.
[00:41:33.279 --> 00:41:35.361]  Just for showing that they were supporting me in this election.
[00:41:35.801 --> 00:41:41.107]  Now in this election what I've tried to do is I've gone into some of the wards here where 82% of people don't vote.
[00:41:41.407 --> 00:41:42.789]  I've gone to the working class
[00:41:43.209 --> 00:41:45.250]  Council States of the North West.
[00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:48.872]  And I'm trying to tell them 22 million people didn't vote in our last general election.
[00:41:49.252 --> 00:41:50.073]  They don't fear us.
[00:41:50.433 --> 00:41:57.577]  Until we get up, until we organise our communities and ourselves and the people from our backgrounds as a weapon to be used in politics against them.
[00:41:57.977 --> 00:41:59.898]  Until we do that, they don't care.
[00:41:59.958 --> 00:42:01.139]  We've been betrayed at every level.
[00:42:01.159 --> 00:42:02.800]  You've all seen the betrayal of our country.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.161]  The betrayal of free speech.
[00:42:04.441 --> 00:42:07.422]  The betrayal of our daughters in every town and city in this country.
[00:42:07.803 --> 00:42:09.223]  And then the final betrayal of all.
[00:42:09.243 --> 00:42:10.124]  Democracy.
[00:42:10.604 --> 00:42:13.225]  They're portraying the democratic will of the people.
[00:42:13.525 --> 00:42:18.067]  Now what I'm telling people is if you want to send them a message they'll never forget.
[00:42:18.328 --> 00:42:22.069]  That comes with Tommy Robinson being elected as a member of European Parliament.
[00:42:22.129 --> 00:42:23.830]  Nigel Farage has been in there 20, 30 years.
[00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:26.391]  And there's nothing they will fear more.
[00:42:26.551 --> 00:42:28.312]  The establishment, the government, the media.
[00:42:28.592 --> 00:42:32.594]  And I want the whole British public, or the North West public, to send them a message on their censorship.
[00:42:32.874 --> 00:42:36.876]  That censorship you're talking about, even just by writing my name in, you'll remove from Facebook.
[00:42:37.296 --> 00:42:38.437]  What level of censorship is that?
[00:42:38.717 --> 00:42:40.978]  I've been removed from absolutely everyone, just like you all have Alex.
[00:42:41.018 --> 00:42:41.859]  Just like we all are.
[00:42:42.099 --> 00:42:43.960]  Without being completely un-person, for what?
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:45.221]  Because we have a different opinion.
[00:42:45.461 --> 00:42:47.022]  Because people are listening to that different opinion.
[00:42:47.342 --> 00:42:48.763]  Because people are realizing their lies.
[00:42:49.744 --> 00:42:52.886]  Because we're not selling our countries out, and we're not selling our daughters out.
[00:42:52.926 --> 00:42:55.447]  Tommy Robinson, you had to relocate from the death threats.
[00:42:55.467 --> 00:42:56.808]  I want to talk about this new film coming out.
[00:42:56.828 --> 00:42:59.630]  I want to talk about how people support you and free speech.
[00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:00.871]  Because the war is now.
[00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:12.212]  I'm here in my parents' kitchen because my house flooded with torrential rains this week.
[00:43:12.873 --> 00:43:15.674]  So the flooded part of the house, they're having to fix that, so I've been staying over here.
[00:43:16.934 --> 00:43:23.537]  And I looked in my parents' cupboard and found that they were stocked up on some of the InfoWars Life products.
[00:43:23.557 --> 00:43:24.357]  And I thought, wait a minute.
[00:43:25.017 --> 00:43:30.960]  I've been thinking about coming over to their house, because their kitchen's nicer than mine, and shooting a video about how amazing these products are.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.647]  So I called Drew, one of our great camera people over at InfoWars this morning.
[00:43:35.248 --> 00:43:40.378]  I said, hey, why don't you meet me over here and I'm going to shoot a video I've been meaning to do for probably a year.
[00:43:40.398 --> 00:43:41.741]  So I'm like, I've got everything right here.
[00:43:43.012 --> 00:43:44.573]  It's time to show you what I personally do.
[00:43:45.053 --> 00:43:46.153]  Now, I want to be clear.
[00:43:47.033 --> 00:43:56.317]  When I remember to take the supplements religiously, I lose weight, I'm healthy, my skin gets great, I have better stamina, libido, energy.
[00:43:56.997 --> 00:43:58.037]  I've never been a supplements guy.
[00:43:58.057 --> 00:44:02.339]  A lot of my big sponsors were supplement people, and I thought, well, why don't I try these then?
[00:44:02.679 --> 00:44:03.719]  And it turned out they were really good.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:07.261]  So we came out, as you know, six years ago with our own line of supplements.
[00:44:07.281 --> 00:44:08.621]  We've been expanding it ever since.
[00:44:08.641 --> 00:44:10.042]  And what we do is,
[00:44:10.942 --> 00:44:17.666]  Set out to already find what's the highest rated, already find what's the cleanest, what's the best, and then make it better, and then cut the price.
[00:44:18.226 --> 00:44:19.827]  And that's what we've done with these products.
[00:44:20.087 --> 00:44:30.032]  And that's why InfoWare's live products are so highly rated by third-party sites, that's why they're so popular with you, and it's also great because it funds our political operations, trying to stop the technotronic, technocracy takeover.
[00:44:32.837 --> 00:44:36.140]  I always start taking the supplements and then I forget to take them.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:41.905]  I either run out or I just get busy and then all of a sudden I'm not taking DNA Force.
[00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:44.067]  All of a sudden, I'm not taking X2.
[00:44:44.107 --> 00:44:45.769]  I'm not taking Secret 12.
[00:44:46.409 --> 00:44:58.280]  That's why it's important for everybody out there that already knows they got great results with these high quality products and InfoWars Life or other supplements you've been taking to remember how good they were for you and your family and to get back into it.
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:06.203]  So today I just wanted to encourage everybody that's gotten great results with these products to just remember that because I need that reminder as well.
[00:45:06.743 --> 00:45:12.986]  One of the biggest things is I tend to go to the warehouse and get some of the products out for myself and then those run out and I forget.
[00:45:13.566 --> 00:45:15.387]  So now what I do, what my parents do,
[00:45:16.407 --> 00:45:31.391]  And other people I know is they just put it on auto ship and then fullwarslive.com get an additional 10% off and then you don't forget each month or every two months how much you want to have it shipped to you to get the product, support the show, and of course also get 10% off.
[00:45:31.911 --> 00:45:39.373]  Now some of the things I do is I don't really like soft drinks because they got so much sugar in them and I already have a problem with sweets sometimes.
[00:45:39.393 --> 00:45:41.834]  So I really like soft drinks what I'm proud to say is.
[00:45:42.694 --> 00:45:43.955]  I don't like the effects they have on me.
[00:45:44.555 --> 00:45:51.059]  So what I do is take something like a Perrier, lime or non-flavored, and I put it into a nice glass.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:56.142]  And then I take the Ultra 12,
[00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:03.173]  And put in a whole dropper, and then I stir it up, and the flavor is incredible.
[00:46:03.654 --> 00:46:18.543]  So again, take your favorite sparkling water that doesn't have any calories in it, either flavored or unflavored, it all goes great with the flavor of natural vitamin B12 that has a sweet taste without any sugar or additives.
[00:46:18.583 --> 00:46:24.507]  You've got to experience Ultra 12 for yourself, you've got to experience X2 as well, and of course, X3.
[00:46:24.607 --> 00:46:26.329]  That's triiodine.
[00:46:27.009 --> 00:46:28.330]  Different strokes for different folks.
[00:46:28.731 --> 00:46:33.935]  Bottom line, these are all incredible products that have changed my life and changed so many other people's lives.
[00:46:34.355 --> 00:46:42.221]  As I've said over and over again, it then funds an organization dedicated to exposing the globalists and their operations.
[00:46:42.261 --> 00:46:43.703]  That's why I thank you all for your support.
[00:46:43.723 --> 00:46:46.365]  I want to encourage you, if you haven't tried these products, to try them.
[00:46:46.405 --> 00:46:48.466]  And if you have tried them and, again, forgot,
[00:46:49.227 --> 00:46:50.949]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:36.900]  You found it!
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.402]  The most banned broadcast in the world!
[00:47:39.422 --> 00:47:41.943]  And we've got one of the other most banned individuals in the world.
[00:47:42.383 --> 00:47:43.624]  Taking away his bank accounts.
[00:47:43.664 --> 00:47:44.905]  Taking away his right to travel.
[00:47:45.245 --> 00:47:46.086]  Putting him in prison.
[00:47:46.166 --> 00:47:47.246]  Trying to starve him to death.
[00:47:47.526 --> 00:47:54.210]  Trying to kill him because he exposed the giant Islamic kidnapping and rape gangs 11 years ago that are now all mainstream news.
[00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:56.872]  Thousands of convictions.
[00:47:57.352 --> 00:47:58.653]  Hundreds of trials.
[00:47:59.193 --> 00:48:04.300]  And so he's public enemy number one in the UK, on with public enemy number one here in the US.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.962]  Of course, public enemy to the globalists.
[00:48:05.982 --> 00:48:07.323]  We're loved by the people.
[00:48:07.824 --> 00:48:11.469]  I'd say I'd shake 50 hands before one person says, F you, die.
[00:48:12.049 --> 00:48:15.213]  But the left is in control of the governments he's running for.
[00:48:18.388 --> 00:48:21.993]  He's in Fleetwood in northern England.
[00:48:22.414 --> 00:48:24.497]  So much happening, so much unfolding.
[00:48:25.038 --> 00:48:27.141]  Tommy, you've got a lot of websites, a lot of places.
[00:48:27.842 --> 00:48:31.427]  Sure, you're kicked off the internet pretty much, but how do people find you online?
[00:48:32.953 --> 00:48:52.954]  So we're on tr.news is my website but then we've just been removed with Stripe have just removed any funding to support us but they've left they've left us with 14 days so we've only got 14 days where we can receive funds on votetommy.co.uk and that's for the campaign we're running but we still have the tr.news but they're only up for 14 days so in 14 days Stripe are pretty much dead.
[00:48:53.454 --> 00:48:53.614]  Yes.
[00:48:53.654 --> 00:48:53.734]  Yes.
[00:49:14.105 --> 00:49:19.269]  So originally they told the whole world that I jeopardised the court trial and I jeopardised the case.
[00:49:19.609 --> 00:49:24.293]  Now for these Muslim paedophiles, 30 men were convicted for the rape of nearly 100 children.
[00:49:24.693 --> 00:49:37.563]  Now one of these paedophiles has appealed his conviction and when he went before the High Court judge on the 21st of November, the High Court judge said he's watched the entirety of my video and nothing I said could have prejudiced the jury.
[00:49:38.083 --> 00:49:41.026]  So then because of that they've now changed their charges.
[00:49:41.046 --> 00:49:42.647]  They sat on these charges for five months
[00:49:43.288 --> 00:49:47.509]  A week after I published Panandrama, the documentary which exposed the BBC trying to set me up.
[00:49:47.929 --> 00:49:53.010]  A week after that, the Attorney General, the British Government, Theresa May's Government, then laid more charges.
[00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:59.992]  So I'm now facing a court trial and my charge is that I caused those Muslim pedophiles anxiety.
[00:50:00.432 --> 00:50:05.093]  Because I stood outside court and I put a camera up to them and I asked them how they felt about their verdict.
[00:50:05.453 --> 00:50:10.574]  And the actual wording from the court is that they must be free to walk into court without fear of molestation.
[00:50:11.252 --> 00:50:15.994]  These are men who have been absolutely molesting children in every town and city in our country.
[00:50:16.315 --> 00:50:18.055]  And that's the charge I now face.
[00:50:18.095 --> 00:50:24.879]  And so it hurts their feelings when they walk into this old famous courthouse and there you are 20 feet away with your camera.
[00:50:25.119 --> 00:50:28.220]  So they're trying to outlaw journalism, period.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:31.082]  That's what's happening in the UK, in Europe and here.
[00:50:31.482 --> 00:50:32.983]  And the articles just pour in, Tommy.
[00:50:33.783 --> 00:50:43.706]  Of the rapes, the murders, the stabbings, crosses being taken down across Europe from Sweden to Greece because it makes the Muslims unhappy.
[00:50:44.326 --> 00:50:46.547]  Europe's talking about having a boiling over right now.
[00:50:46.787 --> 00:50:48.608]  You've been all over Europe, all over the UK.
[00:50:48.848 --> 00:50:52.829]  What is the feeling of the world right now under this UN invasion?
[00:50:54.096 --> 00:51:06.547]  Well, look, the maddest thing is that the journalists, so as I walked into the Old Bailey two days ago, all the journalists were there coming up to me with their cameras, I mean like 50 cameras, sticking them in my face, all asking how I felt and whether I'm going to face justice.
[00:51:06.827 --> 00:51:09.389]  I said, this is exactly what I'm being prosecuted for.
[00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:15.475]  But rather than condemn it on an act of free speech, rather than any of the mainstream journalists you've seen, they all celebrate it.
[00:51:15.915 --> 00:51:17.636]  They all celebrate the fact I've been removed.
[00:51:17.997 --> 00:51:20.079]  They celebrate the fact we get violently attacked.
[00:51:20.339 --> 00:51:21.660]  They celebrate the censorship.
[00:51:22.623 --> 00:51:23.965]  Like it's not going to happen to them.
[00:51:24.466 --> 00:51:25.588]  They all celebrated.
[00:51:25.608 --> 00:51:31.378]  There's not one journalist in this country that has spoke up for the invasion or the attacks on free speech that we're currently witnessing.
[00:51:31.859 --> 00:51:36.006]  Now the only great thing is, just like the American, just like Donald Trump's campaign.
[00:51:36.644 --> 00:51:41.328]  The establishment are against us, the media are against us, the entire political class is against us.
[00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:45.011]  But every time the CIA go into, the people are with us.
[00:51:45.031 --> 00:51:47.674]  So if I can turn people's support into votes.
[00:51:47.994 --> 00:51:52.038]  The biggest problem we've got is 22 million people didn't vote in the last general election.
[00:51:52.338 --> 00:51:54.019]  More people didn't vote than voted for Brexit.
[00:51:54.179 --> 00:51:54.800]  The turnout was only 37%.
[00:51:56.161 --> 00:52:01.485]  Now, people are so disillusioned with those traitors in Parliament, so disillusioned, that they don't vote.
[00:52:01.825 --> 00:52:06.989]  My biggest task is getting those people to vote, and I've had so many people saying, I've never voted before, I'm voting for you.
[00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:15.536]  If I can turn those non-voters into votes, they are going to absolutely fear me like nothing else before, which will be such a momentous moment.
[00:52:15.576 --> 00:52:16.637]  No, I totally agree, Tommy.
[00:52:16.657 --> 00:52:20.179]  Tommy Robinson's our guest, truly a modern treasure.
[00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:24.523]  Let's, Modern Paul Revere, let's back up here to what you just said, because I follow the local news.
[00:52:25.103 --> 00:52:41.334]  You're found in contempt a few days ago for saying months and months and months ago before you got thrown in prison the first time, for no reason, because you were outside a courthouse on a street with people that later got convicted of pedophilia that you'd first exposed, and now they're busting them all over the country.
[00:52:41.734 --> 00:52:46.157]  The very same media then runs up to you, puts cameras in your faces.
[00:52:46.497 --> 00:52:49.299]  They don't get arrested for molesting a poor, innocent person.
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:50.900]  They're press.
[00:52:51.281 --> 00:52:52.942]  This just shows how crazy this is.
[00:52:54.597 --> 00:52:57.878]  So on the 4th of July, that's my trial date, and I keep saying it's not me that's on trial.
[00:52:58.018 --> 00:52:59.339]  It's the British judicial system.
[00:52:59.779 --> 00:53:01.500]  It's the British judicial system that's on trial.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.720]  It's on trial for the world to watch.
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:12.904]  And what I will do is I will have a massive screen parked outside that court, and I will provide a video that I'm going to show in court, where I will show every other sort of convict or criminal, and even paedophile.
[00:53:13.204 --> 00:53:17.846]  As they walk into court, they're harassed and they're attacked, or they're confronted with cameras.
[00:53:18.126 --> 00:53:18.967]  And they're asked questions.
[00:53:19.288 --> 00:53:23.833]  This special right is only being given to these criminals because they're Muslim paedophiles.
[00:53:24.053 --> 00:53:28.519]  And because the government and the establishment and the judges and all of them alike have been trying to keep a lid on this.
[00:53:28.759 --> 00:53:33.144]  And now that people know it's happening, they don't want people to realise exactly what's happening to those children.
[00:53:33.465 --> 00:53:35.107]  So what they do is they put a reporting restriction on.
[00:53:35.387 --> 00:53:37.388]  So no one in the entire country can talk about it.
[00:53:37.689 --> 00:53:40.590]  And then at the end of the six week trial, they lift the reporting restrictions.
[00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:41.931]  So we get one day's worth of news.
[00:53:42.291 --> 00:53:47.955]  Now the court transcripts, which will tell you exactly what happened to those children, they cost tens of thousands of pounds to require.
[00:53:48.335 --> 00:53:52.298]  And then after, if you don't require them, after five years, they're completely erased and deleted.
[00:53:52.638 --> 00:53:59.342]  So what you'll then get is all of these crimes and all the things these men have been doing to these children, the mass rapes and the torture of these children.
[00:53:59.583 --> 00:54:01.604]  No one will ever hear the true story of what's happened.
[00:54:01.884 --> 00:54:03.465]  It will be deleted from history forever.
[00:54:03.865 --> 00:54:04.726]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:54:05.046 --> 00:54:07.948]  And that is the purpose of these reporting restrictions.
[00:54:08.028 --> 00:54:08.549]  Nothing else.
[00:54:08.949 --> 00:54:10.050]  It's nothing else.
[00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:11.871]  They are hiding from the British public.
[00:54:12.151 --> 00:54:23.899]  As I've said to you before, some of the crimes that we heard about years ago, where they're nailing little girls' tongues to tables, where they're putting hot iron rods with the letter M on the girl's buttcheeks when she's 11 years old because they're marking her because she's the property of Mohammed.
[00:54:24.219 --> 00:54:27.861]  These sort of in-depth things you find out from the trial, you don't find them out anymore.
[00:54:28.182 --> 00:54:29.202]  There's reporting restrictions.
[00:54:29.282 --> 00:54:30.803]  No one is allowed to talk about them.
[00:54:30.843 --> 00:54:31.664]  No one in the whole country
[00:54:31.844 --> 00:54:38.529]  And again, the first reporting restrictions were like in World War II on German spies arrested.
[00:54:38.889 --> 00:54:43.972]  Now they've extended it to just judges diddling little kids, Muslims running rape gangs.
[00:54:44.433 --> 00:54:46.334]  It's just incredible, Tommy Robinson.
[00:54:46.714 --> 00:54:49.176]  Now you're going to come on with us on the Sunday show.
[00:54:49.256 --> 00:54:51.177]  I'm live 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:54:51.717 --> 00:54:55.120]  We're going to tape an interview with you this Sunday that will air during the live show.
[00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:58.662]  Very, very important people join us on the Sunday broadcast.
[00:54:58.682 --> 00:55:00.563]  But my friend, I really do admire you.
[00:55:00.643 --> 00:55:01.404]  I appreciate you.
[00:55:02.484 --> 00:55:18.348]  We're in this together, and I just hope with the voice you've got in others, we need to get Paul Watson as well, everybody down to your Parliament, everybody down to our Congress, and say, damn it, defend the First Amendment, defend free speech in Europe, and stop the racketeering, stop the election meddling.
[00:55:18.448 --> 00:55:26.290]  As you said, anybody who's just common sense, who's loyal to the country, loyal to common sense, all the things you've talked about have been proven, you're a hero,
[00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:32.255]  And instead they call you a demon and lie about you just like they do me because they don't want people to know they've got folk heroes.
[00:55:32.495 --> 00:55:33.977]  Just like you said, we had Brexit.
[00:55:34.117 --> 00:55:35.238]  Of course they tried to steal it.
[00:55:35.498 --> 00:55:38.181]  Don't give up, England, just because you're having to fight for it.
[00:55:38.541 --> 00:55:40.082]  You're winning the high ground.
[00:55:40.443 --> 00:55:42.405]  Europe, the EU, starting to fall apart.
[00:55:42.645 --> 00:55:44.607]  You're not going to get this won overnight.
[00:55:44.847 --> 00:55:46.749]  You've got to persevere like Tommy's done.
[00:55:47.029 --> 00:55:48.490]  Closing comments on perseverance.
[00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:50.372]  Something that you can tell us about, Tommy.
[00:55:51.735 --> 00:55:59.141]  Alex, I said when I win this election, I'll be inviting all of you to the European Union for the biggest counter-censorship event anyone's seen.
[00:55:59.481 --> 00:56:03.344]  Because right now, I saw Donald Trump finally talk out about Paul Joseph Watson being removed from Facebook.
[00:56:03.845 --> 00:56:05.146]  Everyone's being removed.
[00:56:05.526 --> 00:56:06.747]  We are all being removed.
[00:56:06.787 --> 00:56:12.251]  And what people like Donald Trump need to understand is they won't win another campaign without the people being able to promote them and talk about them.
[00:56:12.491 --> 00:56:13.212]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:56:13.232 --> 00:56:15.554]  They're erasing everybody across the whole world.
[00:56:15.994 --> 00:56:17.615]  The Silicon Valley needs to be held to account.
[00:56:17.855 --> 00:56:20.656]  And not just as I raise them now, they're stopping our ability to even raise funds.
[00:56:21.036 --> 00:56:23.197]  Or even to be able to work and operate.
[00:56:23.938 --> 00:56:25.638]  This is true authoritarianism.
[00:56:25.698 --> 00:56:31.341]  This is true giant companies gearing up, targeting people, using our digital data to harass us.
[00:56:31.401 --> 00:56:34.002]  Imagine if the NSA did that, they'd all be in prison.
[00:56:34.042 --> 00:56:36.643]  But companies do it together and they're saying it's okay.
[00:56:36.724 --> 00:56:37.604]  No, it's not okay.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:44.362]  It's not okay and we need someone like, you need someone like a leader needs to step forward like Donald Trump and put an end to this.
[00:56:44.942 --> 00:56:46.723]  Put an end to it because it's going to affect us all.
[00:56:47.183 --> 00:56:56.827]  It's affecting us all and quite simply this censorship has to stop and that's why I said I just hope to God that the people of the northwest of England send the establishment, send all of them a message on the 23rd.
[00:56:56.867 --> 00:56:58.688]  It'll be a message they will never ever forget.
[00:56:59.088 --> 00:57:03.670]  Send me in, put me in amongst the middle of them and then I don't want to be the 23rd.
[00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:06.931]  And remember they can try to censor Tommy but if you go to his site
[00:57:07.711 --> 00:57:08.731]  And you can share it.
[00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:10.032]  You can get it out there.
[00:57:10.092 --> 00:57:11.552]  You can tell people about it word of mouth.
[00:57:11.592 --> 00:57:12.313]  You can email it.
[00:57:12.613 --> 00:57:13.613]  You can text message it.
[00:57:13.733 --> 00:57:15.934]  You can override their garbage.
[00:57:15.974 --> 00:57:19.095]  Again, tell folks the best site to visit about your campaign.
[00:57:20.255 --> 00:57:20.895]  And Telegram.
[00:57:20.915 --> 00:57:22.476]  If you get on Telegram, I'm on Telegram.
[00:57:22.836 --> 00:57:24.397]  We've got 42,000 people in our group now.
[00:57:24.817 --> 00:57:27.118]  But I don't want the 23rd of September to be about a protest vote.
[00:57:27.138 --> 00:57:29.638]  I want it to be the start of an uprising over here.
[00:57:30.039 --> 00:57:31.219]  So, we're gonna win.
[00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:32.830]  All right, Tommy.
[00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:33.591]  We'll talk to you again.
[00:57:33.631 --> 00:57:34.432]  We'll talk to you again.
[00:57:34.752 --> 00:57:36.593]  We'll talk to you again on Sunday.
[00:57:36.613 --> 00:57:37.434]  And be safe, my friend.
[00:57:38.875 --> 00:57:39.235]  Thank you, man.
[00:57:39.255 --> 00:57:39.735]  Bye-bye.
[00:57:39.916 --> 00:57:40.096]  All right.
[00:57:40.116 --> 00:57:40.676]  There goes Tommy.
[00:57:40.756 --> 00:57:40.996]  All right.
[00:57:41.156 --> 00:57:42.177]  Hour number two.
[00:57:42.257 --> 00:57:42.778]  Straight ahead.
[00:57:42.798 --> 00:57:43.598]  A ton of news.
[00:57:43.958 --> 00:57:47.121]  Trump getting ready to declare basically martial law over the border.
[00:57:47.241 --> 00:57:48.862]  Your phone calls and so much more.
[00:57:49.142 --> 00:57:50.883]  Infowars.com.
[00:57:50.923 --> 00:57:51.364]  Spread the link.
[00:58:02.449 --> 00:58:09.913]  Yeah, I really appreciate you, and it's an honor to talk to you, and I do, before I start, I also wanted to do a plug for a couple of your products that I really love.
[00:58:09.993 --> 00:58:10.634]  Changed my life.
[00:58:10.714 --> 00:58:13.175]  The DNA Force is one, and X2.
[00:58:13.195 --> 00:58:14.916]  Yeah, I do a lot of construction.
[00:58:15.116 --> 00:58:22.380]  Using the tools that you're using, it just really wreaks havoc on your body, and I had three of my fingers starting to go numb, and I didn't think there was anything I could work on.
[00:58:24.101 --> 00:58:29.243]  Well, thank you, brother.
[00:58:29.263 --> 00:58:35.226]  I mean, we want to sell you stuff that works.
[00:58:35.366 --> 00:58:43.370]  You want to order it again, but PQQ CoQ10 has been proven to make telomeres last longer, to make nerves regrow.
[00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:45.712]  It really is an amazing product for anybody above 40.
[00:58:45.952 --> 00:58:49.073]  Young people can take it as well, but yes, DNA Force Plus is amazing.
[00:58:49.633 --> 00:58:50.274]  What'd you think of the X2?
[00:58:50.794 --> 00:58:51.835]  I love that, too.
[00:58:51.915 --> 00:58:55.897]  After a few months of being on that, I felt like I wasn't searching for words.
[00:58:56.498 --> 00:59:08.225]  There was a time in my life where I felt like, man, I don't know if I'm just too exhausted or what, but I feel like when I get in a conversation and you're pausing and you can't find the word to say, and I swear, man, that X2 really helps with cognition.
[00:59:08.245 --> 00:59:11.026]  Well, that's because the synapses in the brain operate off of it.
[00:59:11.046 --> 00:59:11.747]  It's electrochemical.
[00:59:11.767 --> 00:59:12.547]  You're absolutely right.
[00:59:12.607 --> 00:59:16.309]  When I forget to take X2 every couple days, sometimes I forget for like a week because I get busy.
[00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:18.971]  Then I feel it, and I take it, and it really is amazing.
[00:59:19.051 --> 00:59:20.252]  So thank you for the support, brother.
[00:59:26.241 --> 00:59:29.283]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.

[01:00:00.924 --> 01:00:06.826]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are...
[01:00:26.118 --> 01:00:30.321]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:30.601 --> 01:00:33.484]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.604 --> 01:00:37.827]  In the heat of the night, my friend.
[01:00:38.347 --> 01:00:41.550]  In the heat of the night.
[01:00:42.070 --> 01:00:43.791]  You're like black in my eyes.
[01:00:45.212 --> 01:00:47.414]  Oh, back, oh, back, oh, back.
[01:00:47.494 --> 01:00:50.236]  And I'm coming your way.
[01:00:50.376 --> 01:00:51.097]  Knock them dead.
[01:01:03.796 --> 01:01:05.697]  Blind with hate.
[01:01:07.318 --> 01:01:10.659]  I am your rageaholic, according to Puppy Dumpy that nobody knows about.
[01:01:10.679 --> 01:01:13.301]  Ryan Stelter, kiddies.
[01:01:14.581 --> 01:01:19.544]  You may have never heard of him, but if you see him, he has puppies in the back of that white van.
[01:01:22.159 --> 01:01:23.000]  All right, let's get serious.
[01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:29.965]  I want to open the phones up again this hour, specifically on Trump.
[01:01:31.486 --> 01:01:43.956]  And I want to open the phones up for active duty military, Border Patrol, ICE, Customs, or police officers, peace officers, law enforcement in general.
[01:01:43.976 --> 01:01:50.542]  A lot of folks, a lot of people that want to get fake points against me.
[01:01:51.937 --> 01:02:01.420]  They'll say things like, you know, Jones is Mr. Anti-Police State, but then he wants Trump to declare a national emergency.
[01:02:02.821 --> 01:02:17.966]  A police state is when you don't have due process, and when you don't have rule of law, and you can have an extreme form of fascism or communism that's a police state, or you can have anarchy that always devolves into a true police state.
[01:02:20.746 --> 01:02:21.907]  When the U.N.
[01:02:21.987 --> 01:02:41.821]  and the Democrats break the borders and create lawlessness and mass crime and death, then it is in the Constitution, and it is in common sense, that when you've got hundreds of thousands of people pouring in every week, it's not every month, and the whole system broken, and the U.N.
[01:02:42.642 --> 01:02:45.804]  setting up refugee camps, bum-rushing the whole country,
[01:02:47.813 --> 01:03:02.249]  To overwhelm the courts, to overwhelm the detention centers, and to collapse everything, led by armed men who rape 80% of the women that are brought in, and hundreds of thousands of smuggled children, and total lawlessness.
[01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:03.411]  This is insane!
[01:03:06.494 --> 01:03:13.957]  Oh, but when I want to fly from Austin to D.C., I get asked questions by the TSA and they search my bags.
[01:03:14.597 --> 01:03:21.699]  Internal, unconstitutional checkpoints put in by the federal government because they won't profile jihadis.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:24.600]  Okay, whatever.
[01:03:26.381 --> 01:03:32.923]  But then don't tell me that the border is wide open and that you can't deal with it and stop it.
[01:03:34.195 --> 01:03:47.080]  So only a national emergency declared by the President can circumvent the leftist judges and Congress that won't pass the right laws, where all these people, anybody gets asylum, and anybody gets all these court hearings.
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:48.500]  You don't get that in Mexico.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:49.861]  You don't get that anywhere else.
[01:03:54.062 --> 01:03:55.963]  Time I flew into Canada, they were going to throw me out.
[01:03:56.043 --> 01:03:57.483]  I couldn't declare asylum there.
[01:03:58.244 --> 01:03:59.164]  I was there to cover Bilderberg.
[01:04:00.144 --> 01:04:01.725]  Once it blew up in the news, they had to let me in.
[01:04:03.251 --> 01:04:05.432]  But that was back when we supposedly had freedom in the West.
[01:04:05.492 --> 01:04:06.412]  It was embarrassing.
[01:04:06.653 --> 01:04:07.753]  They were doing that to a journalist.
[01:04:08.974 --> 01:04:22.160]  Now it's all out in the open, so... I'm gonna give the number out specifically and only... for police, military, ICE.
[01:04:23.817 --> 01:04:31.425]  Or anyone in, uh, contractors in that chain of the crisis that Europe was put into, that we put into.
[01:04:31.845 --> 01:04:33.407]  And I'll give the number out, we start the next segment.
[01:04:33.467 --> 01:04:37.030]  And I'm not gonna make you hold more than five minutes.
[01:04:38.029 --> 01:04:45.914]  But that means I'm going to have to move quickly to your calls, because I know people are busy, especially if they're on duty or whatever, but we need the intel to get your take on Trump.
[01:04:46.274 --> 01:04:47.335]  This is what Trump needs to do.
[01:04:47.435 --> 01:04:48.476]  I 100% back it.
[01:04:49.196 --> 01:04:55.060]  But there's going to be fireworks from the traitors who instituted this collapse, who are going to try to stop the president doing the right thing.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.441]  But I liked Trump before.
[01:04:56.501 --> 01:04:57.622]  I really like Trump now.
[01:04:58.222 --> 01:04:59.463]  Yeah, folks, it's martial law.
[01:04:59.843 --> 01:05:01.424]  We're already under anarchy anyways.
[01:05:02.045 --> 01:05:02.405]  Stay with us.
[01:05:06.049 --> 01:05:15.855]  This is next level, breaking ground, history book level, science fiction dystopia, Tyranny on Steroids.
[01:05:33.186 --> 01:05:34.107]  Bing, bing, bong, bong.
[01:05:34.167 --> 01:05:44.854]  Just take the red pill, people!
[01:05:44.934 --> 01:05:45.315]  InfoWars.
[01:05:45.335 --> 01:05:47.376]  The most banned network in the world.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:16.469]  They're intentionally leaving the borders open in Europe, bringing in mass refugees, among them are going to be jihadists, who are setting up a future Tet Offensive, Tet-style offensive, in Europe.
[01:06:16.649 --> 01:06:18.190]  And the same thing's being done to this country.
[01:06:18.671 --> 01:06:29.080]  On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor, half-frozen snake.
[01:06:30.791 --> 01:06:35.212]  His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew.
[01:06:35.732 --> 01:06:36.812]  Oh well, she cried.
[01:06:37.292 --> 01:06:38.073]  I'll take you in.
[01:06:38.513 --> 01:06:39.633]  And I'll take care of you.
[01:06:40.753 --> 01:06:42.233]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:06:42.794 --> 01:06:44.214]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[01:06:44.714 --> 01:06:46.274]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:06:47.335 --> 01:06:49.955]  Sighed the vicious snake.
[01:06:51.936 --> 01:06:54.036]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:06:54.476 --> 01:06:55.916]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[01:06:56.757 --> 01:06:58.237]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:06:59.275 --> 01:07:02.058]  Beside the vicious snake.
[01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:05.782]  Now she clutched him to her bosom.
[01:07:06.263 --> 01:07:08.125]  You're so beautiful, she cried.
[01:07:08.926 --> 01:07:13.210]  But if I hadn't brought you in, by now you might have died.
[01:07:14.306 --> 01:07:19.453]  She stroked his pretty skin, and then she kissed and held him tight.
[01:07:20.414 --> 01:07:27.544]  But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite.
[01:07:28.485 --> 01:07:30.407]  I saved you, cried the woman.
[01:07:31.148 --> 01:07:32.309]  And you've bit me!
[01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:33.750]  Heavens, why?
[01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:39.275]  You know your bite is poisonous, and now I'm going to die!
[01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:44.379]  Oh, shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin.
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:50.464]  You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in!
[01:07:54.067 --> 01:07:59.131]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:06.387 --> 01:08:08.469]  Oh, we live in interesting times, my friends.
[01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:10.050]  Friday, May 17, 2019.
[01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:23.201]  I'm coming to you from what's left of the great state of Texas under California reject invasion, illegal alien mass overthrow.
[01:08:24.304 --> 01:08:26.845]  Just globalism on fire.
[01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:31.866]  Shantytown cities down almost every road I drive in any direction.
[01:08:31.926 --> 01:08:34.607]  Human feces spilling off the curbs.
[01:08:35.027 --> 01:08:37.068]  And I can travel to any city and it's the same.
[01:08:38.548 --> 01:08:40.369]  The attempt to destroy our republic.
[01:08:41.289 --> 01:08:45.970]  The UN using weaponized third world populations against us.
[01:08:46.851 --> 01:08:50.692]  And you've got this bizarre response by Ann Coulter.
[01:08:52.386 --> 01:09:02.135]  Well, I'd love to get back on the show, and I don't think she's a bad person, but she's always like, oh, Trump, 3D chess, we've got double the number of illegals coming in, on average, sometimes triple.
[01:09:02.916 --> 01:09:03.817]  Yeah, this is the U.N.
[01:09:03.857 --> 01:09:04.297]  assault.
[01:09:04.898 --> 01:09:07.480]  They just did it to Europe, they're doing it to us, they're running it.
[01:09:08.061 --> 01:09:16.429]  Why don't you talk about George Soros and how he gets the State Department money, and how that needs to be stopped, and how they give $1,000 per leg of the trip to get here.
[01:09:17.765 --> 01:09:24.667]  Or why don't you talk about people in Congress that are blocking Trump who wanted $12 billion instead of $1,300,000,000 to try to stop this?
[01:09:25.827 --> 01:09:28.768]  Again, yes you see the headlines.
[01:09:28.788 --> 01:09:31.709]  It's on DrudgeReport.com right now.
[01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:43.093]  Trump to release 200 plus thousand people onto the streets of the United States.
[01:09:43.113 --> 01:09:43.093]  225,000.
[01:09:43.133 --> 01:09:44.013]  Just to dump them off at shelters?
[01:09:48.916 --> 01:09:52.379]  Well, what do you think happens when there's a hurricane where the government can't run or fix everything?
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:56.403]  Under law, he can't throw them back over the other side of the border.
[01:09:57.264 --> 01:10:05.853]  Once they step foot here, they get screened for medical issues and then released.
[01:10:05.933 --> 01:10:07.514]  But they don't even have personnel for that now.
[01:10:08.055 --> 01:10:11.799]  So they have record numbers of Border Patrol contracting diseases.
[01:10:13.035 --> 01:10:14.376]  TB, you name it.
[01:10:14.996 --> 01:10:17.218]  Our kids in the border states are getting record numbers.
[01:10:17.838 --> 01:10:20.460]  They admit all the major measles outbreaks are from illegals.
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:22.861]  But the answer is, tell citizens we're bad.
[01:10:24.622 --> 01:10:35.389]  And so Trump, as Eisenhower did, and as George Herbert Walker did, and they had previous emergencies before that, is set to declare a national emergency.
[01:10:35.429 --> 01:10:38.471]  And not a national emergency where he frees up some funds
[01:10:40.441 --> 01:10:46.602]  No, a real commander-in-chief, defend the border, Constitution, it's in the Constitution.
[01:10:47.222 --> 01:10:52.284]  He can use some of the acts that have been invoked before, because those are frameworks, but it's in the Constitution.
[01:10:52.304 --> 01:10:53.584]  The President protects the border.
[01:10:53.944 --> 01:10:54.704]  It's his job.
[01:10:56.044 --> 01:10:58.145]  And if he doesn't do it, then he's in dereliction of duty.
[01:10:58.185 --> 01:11:02.926]  So Ann Coulter's right that if Trump doesn't call up the military,
[01:11:03.914 --> 01:11:12.816]  And start actually going after the people that are organizing this, the coyotes, the Democrats that make the money off smuggling, the immigration lawyers that are controlling all of this.
[01:11:14.517 --> 01:11:15.777]  Then he's aiding and abetting.
[01:11:16.337 --> 01:11:19.218]  I feel sorry for the third world populations pouring in.
[01:11:19.478 --> 01:11:21.098]  But most of them are military-aged men.
[01:11:21.638 --> 01:11:27.700]  And Mexico itself has collapsed into martial law and into anarchy in most areas.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.840]  Because of the underlying anarchy.
[01:11:30.981 --> 01:11:32.501]  And so I don't like martial law.
[01:11:33.482 --> 01:11:39.947]  But when you've already been put into a state of anarchy, only a true civil emergency has any chance of fixing it.
[01:11:39.967 --> 01:11:58.403]  Because by the very definitions, and this is for the general public, this is historical fact, anarchy is the absence of law or order or civil systems or jails or municipal governments or state governments or a system of government.
[01:12:00.051 --> 01:12:00.652]  It's Road Warrior.
[01:12:00.953 --> 01:12:01.714]  It's Somalia.
[01:12:01.854 --> 01:12:02.495]  It's Hell on Earth.
[01:12:03.176 --> 01:12:03.477]  Okay?
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.765]  Then you've got martial law.
[01:12:09.026 --> 01:12:11.089]  Martial law is associated with third world countries.
[01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:12.571]  It's associated with failure.
[01:12:14.383 --> 01:12:23.188]  It's associated with authoritarianism, because the Clintons wanted to have martial law, we learned, for gun confiscation, which Kamala Harris and others have said, we'll have a national emergency.
[01:12:23.208 --> 01:12:25.650]  Remember she threatened Trump when he wanted a national emergency?
[01:12:25.670 --> 01:12:28.832]  She said, we'll have one, she's a prosecutor, to take the guns.
[01:12:29.212 --> 01:12:31.373]  That's the martial law we don't want.
[01:12:33.334 --> 01:12:42.060]  And we don't want the martial law of having to put 200,000 troops on the border, or having to ignore the federal judges and the systems and to just helicopter these people back.
[01:12:42.944 --> 01:12:43.464]  But you know what?
[01:12:43.884 --> 01:12:57.710]  When we're already brought here of anarchy, and we've already got hundreds of thousands a month pouring across, and diseases, and Democrats caught child trafficking, and the breakdown of civilization and society, it's not the right, it's the duty.
[01:12:58.351 --> 01:13:02.913]  And I politically use the term martial law because we're going to be honest with people.
[01:13:04.033 --> 01:13:05.414]  This is a form of martial law.
[01:13:06.175 --> 01:13:07.997]  That Trump is preparing to answer to.
[01:13:08.738 --> 01:13:25.738]  All martial law means is, in absence of normal, regular law, because it's failed, because the government's collapsed, then martial law, meaning martial, meaning the martial of the band, meaning military.
[01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:29.565]  And so that's where we are in this country.
[01:13:30.165 --> 01:13:41.212]  With Antifa wanting their violent overthrow, and with the universities saying no free speech, and big tech involved in information warfare against the people, and 15 million military-age men the last six years in Europe.
[01:13:41.352 --> 01:13:43.153]  Europe collapsing.
[01:13:43.174 --> 01:13:46.115]  80% reduction in tourism.
[01:13:47.616 --> 01:13:49.457]  Tent cities and feces everywhere.
[01:13:50.178 --> 01:13:51.359]  Citizens being attacked.
[01:13:52.419 --> 01:13:53.120]  Lawlessness.
[01:13:54.175 --> 01:14:01.019]  This is the leftist takedown plan to destroy, to bring down the existing order and then build an authoritarianism on top of it.
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:13.147]  So to stop them from creating real authoritarian martial law that Soros and other documents have shown they wanted, Trump has to declare historic civil emergency that is a little
[01:14:14.042 --> 01:14:14.923]  We're good to go.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.621]  And Cory Booker admits, oh, don't bring the illegal aliens to our cities.
[01:14:41.201 --> 01:14:44.542]  It's, quote, dangerous, quote, makes us less safe.
[01:14:46.562 --> 01:14:51.663]  And so now Trump's going to bust these people to Democrat cities and see how you like it.
[01:14:51.763 --> 01:14:53.304]  And they're like, no, no, no.
[01:14:53.684 --> 01:14:55.444]  That's to turn your cities blue.
[01:14:56.224 --> 01:14:57.464]  That's our new voting bloc.
[01:14:57.505 --> 01:14:58.365]  You don't bring them here.
[01:14:58.785 --> 01:14:59.905]  Oh, yes, we do.
[01:15:00.425 --> 01:15:04.186]  Until the civil emergency has been declared.
[01:15:06.658 --> 01:15:10.778]  It's happening, President Trump plans to invoke the Insurrection Act to remove illegal aliens from...
[01:15:12.239 --> 01:15:13.000]  The United States.
[01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:16.242]  We're going to take your phone calls for military, law enforcement, ICE, you name it.
[01:15:16.262 --> 01:15:17.322]  We'll go right to you quickly.
[01:15:17.342 --> 01:15:18.223]  Just have your point.
[01:15:18.303 --> 01:15:25.908]  We'll move to the next person.
[01:15:25.928 --> 01:15:26.848]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:15:26.868 --> 01:15:27.068]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:27.088 --> 01:15:27.349]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:27.989 --> 01:15:28.770]  What do you make of this?
[01:15:28.810 --> 01:15:33.933]  We'll do the first few rounds for just law enforcement and military and ICE and people on the border.
[01:15:34.373 --> 01:15:35.514]  And then we'll open it up in general.
[01:15:35.834 --> 01:15:36.574]  Folks that disagree.
[01:15:37.816 --> 01:15:38.356]  How many more?
[01:15:38.436 --> 01:15:39.057]  100 million?
[01:15:39.417 --> 01:15:39.737]  200 million?
[01:15:39.957 --> 01:15:42.859]  The UN wants 600 million to be brought into the United States.
[01:15:42.879 --> 01:15:43.659]  That's an official number.
[01:15:43.679 --> 01:15:46.480]  Do you have any idea what you're talking about?
[01:15:47.061 --> 01:15:50.483]  Why is everybody fleeing the third world to just bring it here?
[01:15:50.503 --> 01:15:50.763]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:51.263 --> 01:15:56.306]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:15:56.686 --> 01:16:01.328]  We're just loyal, common sense Americans standing against globalist tyranny and winning.
[01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:19.254]  Larry C. Johnson, without going through your whole bio, distinguished CIA, counterterrorism expert, run major operations, you're a respected guy and a patriot.
[01:16:19.434 --> 01:16:25.318]  What would you call this period we're in and now that the deep state or criminal elements of it have failed, where we're going here?
[01:16:25.558 --> 01:16:30.721]  The intelligence community and the law enforcement community have been weaponized against the domestic
[01:16:32.622 --> 01:16:34.063]  It's that simple.
[01:16:34.403 --> 01:16:44.431]  We've really never experienced in our history where these tools of government were turned on the opposing political party in such an intense way.
[01:16:44.571 --> 01:16:49.675]  You know, people will disparage Trump for calling it a coup, but I don't know what else you can call it.
[01:16:50.115 --> 01:17:00.981]  This is exactly a failed coup attempt, and people like Jim Clapper, John Brennan, Jim Comey, and Loretta Lynch, Susan Rice, they were all involved, all implicated.
[01:17:01.201 --> 01:17:10.506]  And they're trying to pretend now that they were just looking for the bad deeds of Russians who just happened to stumble across all these Trump people, which is just a lie.
[01:17:10.606 --> 01:17:15.349]  The other point, though, I think you correctly know, is this didn't just start with Donald Trump.
[01:17:15.429 --> 01:17:15.829]  It started
[01:17:16.349 --> 01:17:19.170]  You yourself have experienced this persecution.
[01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:23.491]  We saw that James Rosen of Fox News was being spied upon.
[01:17:23.871 --> 01:17:25.892]  Other journalists were being spied upon.
[01:17:26.232 --> 01:17:37.275]  So this is something that the Obama administration started doing early on, and then it just, they got so used to doing it and getting away with it, it just escalated and expanded dramatically.
[01:17:37.635 --> 01:17:37.895]  Then when
[01:17:39.035 --> 01:17:45.261]  You know, it went through phases with Trump, because in the initial phase of the Trump campaign, nobody thought he was going to win.
[01:17:45.401 --> 01:17:51.867]  And then, when it looked like Trump was going to get the nomination, it entered another phase, even more intense.
[01:17:52.407 --> 01:17:53.729]  And this starts about March of 2016.
[01:17:56.087 --> 01:18:05.252]  And you can see, that's when Perkins Coie hires Fusion GPS, and Christopher Steele is brought on to do the dossier.
[01:18:05.593 --> 01:18:09.855]  That's the time period they start going intensively after Papadopoulos.
[01:18:09.915 --> 01:18:12.677]  That's the time frame when they start going after Carter Page.
[01:18:12.797 --> 01:18:15.358]  So this is sort of a natural progression.
[01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:18.440]  And then phase three comes when Trump stuns them.
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:19.701]  Because I know for a fact
[01:18:19.721 --> 01:18:27.306]  ...from a friend who was present in some conversations between Clapper and Brennan, that they genuinely did not believe that Trump would win.
[01:18:27.446 --> 01:18:30.949]  And they were even counseled by the FBI to don't be so certain of that.
[01:18:31.069 --> 01:18:40.416]  So what they counted on was they could justify their actions as a counterintelligence investigation because they had, quote, intelligence that was leading them to do this.
[01:18:40.556 --> 01:18:47.621]  But what they didn't admit to is that that intelligence was actually produced in response to requests from the Clinton campaign.
[01:18:48.041 --> 01:18:48.201]  Yes.
[01:19:05.408 --> 01:19:07.569]  Such a dishonest display.
[01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:17.892]  I mean, deliberate dishonesty on the part of media types, particularly at MSNBC and at CNN, but it's really going throughout the media.
[01:19:18.313 --> 01:19:21.454]  No one's actually trying to be honest about covering the stories.
[01:19:21.494 --> 01:19:23.494]  Now, the saving grace is this.
[01:19:24.155 --> 01:19:30.977]  Talk radio, like your show and like Rush Limbaugh's show, if you compare Rush Limbaugh's show to all the major media,
[01:19:31.741 --> 01:19:40.583]  As many people listen to Rush Limbaugh as watch ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News on any given night.
[01:19:40.723 --> 01:19:41.423]  Think about that.
[01:19:41.763 --> 01:19:46.265]  Your show and other shows, it gets out there and it counters the argument.
[01:19:46.405 --> 01:19:47.405]  They can't control it.
[01:19:47.425 --> 01:19:48.685]  They want to try to control it.
[01:19:49.025 --> 01:19:55.727]  The way they try to control it is by destroying you, by destroying your reputation, and by trying to characterize you as a complete crank.
[01:20:05.805 --> 01:20:12.011]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.719 --> 01:20:23.442]  You're listening to the antidote for fake news.
[01:20:24.003 --> 01:20:25.945]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:27.521 --> 01:20:30.303]  Alright, we've already got a bunch of calls rolling in.
[01:20:31.084 --> 01:20:37.928]  Lynn and Jason and Tom and Mike, police officers, active duty military, border patrol, you name it.
[01:20:38.689 --> 01:20:43.292]  We'll be taking your calls throughout the broadcast and I'm gonna go to people as quickly as possible.
[01:20:43.833 --> 01:20:44.753]  Here's some of the headlines.
[01:20:46.485 --> 01:20:55.854]  Report shows almost half of all federal crimes committed by non-citizens in 2008, illegal aliens and others are four times more likely to commit crimes.
[01:20:56.575 --> 01:21:05.683]  That doesn't mean they're all criminals, but there is a good percentage of people that come here fleeing justice to commit more crimes under aliases, like a lot of U.S.
[01:21:05.723 --> 01:21:07.405]  criminals famously run to Mexico.
[01:21:08.965 --> 01:21:09.625]  It's happening.
[01:21:10.226 --> 01:21:12.507]  President Trump plans to invoke Insurrection Act.
[01:21:12.587 --> 01:21:15.889]  That is full Commander-in-Chief defending the border.
[01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:17.811]  The real national emergency.
[01:21:18.331 --> 01:21:20.412]  And there's all these Democrats saying, oh we can block that.
[01:21:20.452 --> 01:21:21.093]  No you can't.
[01:21:21.633 --> 01:21:23.254]  Only impeachment can block that.
[01:21:24.495 --> 01:21:27.157]  Now there may be some idiots out there that follow orders of federal judges.
[01:21:28.038 --> 01:21:32.401]  No, not on the border, not in a crisis, not with disease and crime pouring over.
[01:21:32.661 --> 01:21:35.343]  That is 100% executive branch died in the wall.
[01:21:35.803 --> 01:21:41.366]  And when it gets to the Supreme Court, it'll be found to be constitutional, just like his banning people from seven countries.
[01:21:42.027 --> 01:21:44.889]  But all the other courts ruled against him in virtue signaling.
[01:21:45.469 --> 01:21:47.170]  A five-year-old could read the Constitution.
[01:21:47.450 --> 01:21:50.892]  The president can ban anybody he wants from whole countries if he wants.
[01:21:51.333 --> 01:21:53.874]  That's what the presidency's about, is the damn border.
[01:21:54.555 --> 01:21:55.876]  So, there you go.
[01:21:56.823 --> 01:21:57.383]  But it's happening.
[01:21:57.864 --> 01:21:59.505]  They're the ones that have created anarchy.
[01:21:59.545 --> 01:22:00.706]  There's already no law.
[01:22:01.686 --> 01:22:04.168]  And so the President's like, OK, Congress won't act.
[01:22:05.649 --> 01:22:06.389]  Courts won't act.
[01:22:07.230 --> 01:22:08.090]  Everything's overwhelmed.
[01:22:08.110 --> 01:22:10.452]  The Border Patrol's begging for help, saying SOS.
[01:22:11.132 --> 01:22:12.673]  OK, civil emergency.
[01:22:13.194 --> 01:22:19.418]  We're going to read, next segment after I take calls, or in between calls, the actual federal law on that.
[01:22:19.438 --> 01:22:20.178]  10 U.S.
[01:22:20.218 --> 01:22:25.442]  Code Title 252, Use of Militia and Armed Forces to Enforce Federal Authority.
[01:22:26.527 --> 01:22:29.489]  During Civil War, during insurrection, during invasion.
[01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:34.813]  We haven't been here since the Civil War, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:35.853 --> 01:22:39.076]  We haven't been to the use of something like this at this level.
[01:22:39.656 --> 01:22:40.477]  Eisenhower did it.
[01:22:41.637 --> 01:22:41.998]  H.W.
[01:22:42.018 --> 01:22:44.199]  did it some, but nothing like this.
[01:22:44.339 --> 01:22:49.563]  And it's completely warranted textbook case of when you would do this, in my view.
[01:22:50.959 --> 01:22:52.380]  Okay, let's go to Jason in Texas.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:54.202]  Active duty Army on border topic.
[01:22:54.682 --> 01:22:56.203]  What do you make of the Commander-in-Chief?
[01:22:56.664 --> 01:23:00.567]  I mean, I'm glad he's finally getting ready to act, but this all hell's gonna break loose in my view.
[01:23:02.128 --> 01:23:03.890]  Well, good talking to you, Alex.
[01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:07.653]  And I'll tell you what, I've been listening to your show now for about 10 years or so.
[01:23:08.374 --> 01:23:17.101]  And this topic is very interesting to me because I'm an immigrant also, and I've been in the Army active duty for 10 plus years.
[01:23:19.549 --> 01:23:25.234]  It's pretty clear in the Constitution, Article 4, Section 4, that that's the President's job, is to protect the borders.
[01:23:25.674 --> 01:23:36.243]  And the one place the military troops should be, versus, you know, doing nation-building and changing governments in other places, is protecting the borders of the United States, in my opinion.
[01:23:37.704 --> 01:23:39.886]  That is the default thing of the Executive.
[01:23:39.926 --> 01:23:42.048]  I mean, it's like you said, Article 4, Section 4.
[01:23:42.248 --> 01:23:46.051]  It is, and it's that one clear.
[01:23:47.236 --> 01:23:59.562]  In there, I think them taking the Pledge of Allegiance from the schools and not actually teaching what the Constitution says, they're misleading the country in a lot of ways because they keep calling it a democracy.
[01:23:59.622 --> 01:23:59.922]  It's not.
[01:23:59.962 --> 01:24:01.483]  It's a constitutional republic.
[01:24:01.583 --> 01:24:07.905]  It's clear as day written in the Constitution what the purpose of the military is supposed to be about.
[01:24:08.466 --> 01:24:11.367]  And a lot of the language is very misleading to people.
[01:24:12.227 --> 01:24:14.148]  The United States has never been a democracy.
[01:24:14.168 --> 01:24:16.029]  It's always been a constitutional republic.
[01:24:17.797 --> 01:24:19.135]  You're absolutely right, and...
[01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:31.715]  We need immigrants who've been in countries that have tyranny, or have other experiences, other cultures, that does make us richer, who come here and want to be part of it, and then we all merge together into the great American system.
[01:24:32.335 --> 01:24:38.658]  But they bring people in now, and they turn them against the country immediately, that's why this is cancer, and they put them on welfare immediately.
[01:24:39.138 --> 01:24:44.340]  So we absolutely need good people to come and be Americans like you've done, and that's beautiful and wonderful.
[01:24:44.961 --> 01:24:47.702]  But you're absolutely right, this crisis,
[01:24:48.582 --> 01:24:49.343]  It's out of control.
[01:24:49.703 --> 01:24:50.864]  We're in a form of anarchy.
[01:24:51.225 --> 01:24:52.786]  And the president must act.
[01:24:52.886 --> 01:25:00.094]  My concern, Jason, is the left and others are going to basically call this dictatorship when it's not.
[01:25:00.594 --> 01:25:02.096]  And I think all hell's gonna break loose.
[01:25:02.116 --> 01:25:03.837]  But the president doesn't have a choice.
[01:25:04.438 --> 01:25:06.040]  Because all hell's already breaking loose.
[01:25:07.216 --> 01:25:13.503]  Well, all hell's been breaking loose for a number of years now, and there was nothing wrong with initially how they did it in Ellis Island.
[01:25:13.523 --> 01:25:20.230]  They'd bring people over, they'd document them, they'd make sure that they knew who they were, they didn't have any communicable diseases that could affect the population.
[01:25:20.689 --> 01:25:29.473]  And then they let them into the country, and several generations of Americans have built generational wealth for themselves using that process.
[01:25:29.513 --> 01:25:33.194]  I don't see anything wrong with that process, and I can speak on it because I am an immigrant.
[01:25:33.234 --> 01:25:34.134]  I came over legally.
[01:25:34.475 --> 01:25:35.415]  I joined the military.
[01:25:35.675 --> 01:25:42.278]  Their current provisions were immigrants that come over can join active duty, and they can be a citizen in as little as 90 days.
[01:25:43.158 --> 01:25:44.998]  So I don't see what the problem is with doing it.
[01:25:45.018 --> 01:25:45.278]  You're right.
[01:25:45.318 --> 01:25:47.019]  We have the most open system in the world.
[01:25:47.499 --> 01:25:50.540]  And I think we should go to the merit-based system like you joined the military.
[01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:52.560]  That's meritorious what you did.
[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:54.220]  Thank you so much for your great points.
[01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:58.601]  And again, they always go, oh, Ellis Island, bring people in.
[01:25:58.881 --> 01:26:04.302]  They held people for three months, on average, in quarantine to make sure they didn't bring diseases in.
[01:26:04.842 --> 01:26:06.183]  No one's being checked.
[01:26:06.603 --> 01:26:07.883]  Diseases are pouring in.
[01:26:08.383 --> 01:26:12.444]  Local health departments, and I admit, almost all the new disease is from illegals.
[01:26:14.022 --> 01:26:15.882]  Treat the damn illegals at least!
[01:26:15.962 --> 01:26:17.343]  This is crazy!
[01:26:17.823 --> 01:26:19.283]  Unless you want to bankrupt the country.
[01:26:20.203 --> 01:26:23.804]  Okay, Tom in Texas, then Brad, Mike, Mike, Debbie and others.
[01:26:24.504 --> 01:26:27.765]  Tom is a police officer and wants to report on the border.
[01:26:28.005 --> 01:26:29.845]  What's your view on what Trump's getting ready to do?
[01:26:30.825 --> 01:26:32.086]  Yes sir, thank you for the call.
[01:26:32.326 --> 01:26:33.866]  Big listener, regular caller.
[01:26:33.886 --> 01:26:35.666]  Appreciate all your products and everything else.
[01:26:35.746 --> 01:26:37.647]  I won't waste any more of your time, sir.
[01:26:39.170 --> 01:26:41.011]  In the last week, I'm in North Texas.
[01:26:42.472 --> 01:26:45.154]  I have arrested three illegals myself.
[01:26:46.214 --> 01:26:49.536]  That had drug contraband as well as other things on them.
[01:26:50.016 --> 01:26:51.257]  I'm nowhere near the border.
[01:26:51.857 --> 01:26:54.019]  I'm closer to Oklahoma than I am Mexico.
[01:26:55.179 --> 01:26:58.721]  They have invaded us on every level as well known.
[01:26:59.362 --> 01:27:08.347]  Their influence from MS-13 to the drug pushers and everything else has gotten everywhere and
[01:27:09.053 --> 01:27:11.454]  Trump must shut this place down now.
[01:27:11.974 --> 01:27:14.774]  This is beyond an emergency and it must be done.
[01:27:14.994 --> 01:27:18.315]  I'm telling you, Alex, I'm on the street and I see these things.
[01:27:18.735 --> 01:27:23.316]  It scares me to death that my kids, your children, everybody else's are walking the streets with these people.
[01:27:23.776 --> 01:27:29.438]  Listen, I agree because I went down to Cancun a few months ago and people said, hey, that's really dangerous.
[01:27:29.458 --> 01:27:30.058]  You better look.
[01:27:30.438 --> 01:27:31.758]  And I was with some law enforcement.
[01:27:31.778 --> 01:27:32.899]  They were showing me stuff nobody knew.
[01:27:33.259 --> 01:27:34.099]  So I left.
[01:27:34.679 --> 01:27:36.260]  And then I talk to folks all over Mexico.
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:38.561]  It's all basically anarchy and death now.
[01:27:38.921 --> 01:27:40.262]  We're very close to that.
[01:27:40.602 --> 01:27:42.283]  And crime's been going down for 30 years.
[01:27:42.723 --> 01:27:44.164]  Now it's exploding back up.
[01:27:44.324 --> 01:27:47.466]  And then they admit it's almost all the criminal influx.
[01:27:47.586 --> 01:27:48.906]  Why would the Democrats do this?
[01:27:50.327 --> 01:27:50.987]  Plain and simple.
[01:27:51.028 --> 01:27:56.190]  The Democrats, as you have preached and preached and preached, they want the control.
[01:27:56.250 --> 01:28:01.433]  They want us no different from any third world crap hole, for lack of a better term.
[01:28:02.452 --> 01:28:03.493]  So they have all the power.
[01:28:03.533 --> 01:28:04.333]  They have all the votes.
[01:28:04.373 --> 01:28:05.173]  They have all the money.
[01:28:05.254 --> 01:28:06.314]  They bring in the illegals.
[01:28:06.694 --> 01:28:08.055]  They get us hooked on their drugs.
[01:28:08.595 --> 01:28:09.936]  They get us on their welfare.
[01:28:10.776 --> 01:28:11.737]  And we have no say so.
[01:28:11.797 --> 01:28:12.517]  We have no vote.
[01:28:12.537 --> 01:28:13.478]  We have no anything.
[01:28:13.678 --> 01:28:15.999]  And we're converted to Chicago or San Francisco.
[01:28:16.039 --> 01:28:16.379]  That's it.
[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:20.862]  Alex, this may be controversial, but this is my personal opinion.
[01:28:20.902 --> 01:28:22.562]  This is not a reflection of anybody else.
[01:28:23.263 --> 01:28:27.325]  I'm against any immigration at this point because we have gotten so much in here.
[01:28:28.297 --> 01:28:33.241]  If even half of the people who came in vote, there's no way we'll ever win another election again.
[01:28:34.282 --> 01:28:37.084]  Well, it's true because of the brainwashing of the groups brought in.
[01:28:37.104 --> 01:28:45.470]  That's what the Democrats are accelerating, and they think it's almost game over, offering all this free stuff that, of course, nobody's ever going to get once the country goes bankrupt.
[01:28:45.810 --> 01:28:46.691]  I mean, I think you're right.
[01:28:46.711 --> 01:28:51.435]  I think Trump's about to declare, we're full, we're done, until they stabilize the border.
[01:28:51.775 --> 01:28:52.836]  I think what you're saying is true.
[01:28:52.856 --> 01:28:54.457]  I don't think it's controversial at all.
[01:28:54.697 --> 01:28:55.218]  Thank you, Tom.
[01:28:55.418 --> 01:28:56.478]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:28:56.498 --> 01:28:56.899]  Stay with us.
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:02.863]  Everyone knows.
[01:29:06.673 --> 01:29:07.634]  Marcos, thanks for holding.
[01:29:07.694 --> 01:29:09.796]  I really appreciate you joining us on this Friday edition.
[01:29:09.836 --> 01:29:10.416]  What's your view?
[01:29:10.436 --> 01:29:11.077]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[01:29:11.157 --> 01:29:12.237]  I appreciate you having me on.
[01:29:12.298 --> 01:29:14.059]  First off, I wanted to thank you for the body.
[01:29:14.119 --> 01:29:25.408]  You've been using it for a while, but I sent a bottle to my mom, and after taking it for a few days, she called me literally in tears, saying that she could see the knuckles on her fingers again and, like, the bones in her knees again.
[01:29:25.448 --> 01:29:26.369]  She was ecstatic.
[01:29:26.409 --> 01:29:33.034]  So, personal thank you to you for that, because anybody who makes my mom's life a little bit easier has a special place in my heart.
[01:29:33.214 --> 01:29:33.715]  Tumor-y.
[01:29:34.631 --> 01:29:37.393]  Curry in India is powerful.
[01:29:37.433 --> 01:29:39.695]  The average turmeric product is about 3-5%.
[01:29:39.775 --> 01:29:40.136]  Ours is 95%.
[01:29:40.176 --> 01:29:43.158]  The strongest curcuminoid out there.
[01:29:43.759 --> 01:29:46.441]  So, Anvil works great when I got twisted ankle.
[01:29:46.801 --> 01:29:50.204]  This is nature's Anvil to the next level.
[01:29:50.784 --> 01:29:52.706]  So that's why BODYS is so incredible.
[01:29:52.746 --> 01:29:55.068]  People should really check it out and support The Anvil Wars.
[01:29:55.088 --> 01:29:58.511]  So thank you for giving us your testimony about your mother because BODYS is amazing.
[01:29:58.611 --> 01:29:59.392]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[01:30:03.852 --> 01:30:11.639]  I scream, and it's like Google goes, I'm wearing a pink and a green sock, and I got a little beard, and I talk like this.
[01:30:11.659 --> 01:30:13.221]  You know what those guys do when they get on jets?
[01:30:13.461 --> 01:30:18.285]  They go, bring me 15 hookers now, and get the drugs ready, and take me to private island.
[01:30:18.305 --> 01:30:21.228]  Get the satanic rituals ready.
[01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:25.852]  You don't just think the enemy has sleeper cells, do you?
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:37.342]  They've told me directly, if I don't want to be sued, if I don't want to be attacked, if I don't want to be, you name it, stop reporting on this.
[01:30:37.622 --> 01:30:40.523]  And guess what I'm going to say to the big bank, the New York Federal Reserve, everybody else.
[01:30:40.543 --> 01:30:41.703]  Here's what I have to say to them.
[01:30:42.084 --> 01:30:42.524]  Hey, you ready?
[01:30:42.544 --> 01:30:44.284]  This is what I'm saying to you right now.
[01:30:44.845 --> 01:30:45.645]  You got that message?
[01:30:46.345 --> 01:30:47.025]  Never going to stop.
[01:30:47.305 --> 01:30:47.926]  Never going to stop.
[01:30:47.946 --> 01:30:48.746]  Going to beat you too.
[01:30:51.027 --> 01:30:51.827]  We're in a fight here.
[01:30:52.307 --> 01:30:54.328]  I got like two battle axes fighting them.
[01:30:54.348 --> 01:30:55.268]  They're hacking at me.
[01:30:55.288 --> 01:30:56.189]  We're like, ah!
[01:30:58.109 --> 01:31:00.050]  But you don't want to come out of mommy's basement.
[01:31:01.559 --> 01:31:07.402]  You want to sit there and suck on your own little wee-wee and play video games and pretend like you're this big, you know, badass person.
[01:31:07.583 --> 01:31:09.544]  You're a soldier on the internet battling everybody.
[01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:13.506]  A lot of liberals have broken their conditioning because of it.
[01:31:13.526 --> 01:31:14.607]  Just keep making fun of me!
[01:31:14.787 --> 01:31:15.467]  Keep attacking!
[01:31:15.507 --> 01:31:16.127]  I love it!
[01:31:16.147 --> 01:31:17.328]  I'm totally destroying you!
[01:31:23.972 --> 01:31:24.712]  So under U.S.
[01:31:24.752 --> 01:31:27.914]  Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1528, Paragraph B... Is that true?
[01:31:27.934 --> 01:31:30.015]  You nailed that right there?
[01:31:30.036 --> 01:31:30.596]  Yes, yes.
[01:31:35.085 --> 01:31:37.169]  Oh man, you want to fight, you're gonna get one.
[01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:40.616]  I don't want to lose my voice.
[01:31:40.717 --> 01:31:41.498]  I just want you to know.
[01:31:47.523 --> 01:31:52.504]  The majority of the frogs in most areas in the United States are now gay.
[01:31:54.705 --> 01:31:56.785]  But it's like a rape thing.
[01:31:57.325 --> 01:31:59.866]  You know, it looks all nice and candy, puppy.
[01:31:59.886 --> 01:32:01.386]  That's how they act all liberal.
[01:32:01.686 --> 01:32:03.507]  Oh my gosh, communism's really good.
[01:32:03.727 --> 01:32:04.407]  You're gonna like it.
[01:32:04.427 --> 01:32:05.207]  Get in the car.
[01:32:05.227 --> 01:32:09.008]  How do you like that, Wonder Man?
[01:32:10.248 --> 01:32:11.129]  Oh yeah, you like that?
[01:32:11.149 --> 01:32:11.629]  Let's see it again.
[01:32:11.949 --> 01:32:12.189]  Oh yeah?
[01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:15.350]  Woo!
[01:32:15.390 --> 01:32:16.870]  Yeah, that's goblin power.
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:21.821]  This broadcast is in full force.
[01:32:21.861 --> 01:32:26.122]  I'm Alex Jones and I do the show here weekdays 11 a.m.
[01:32:26.162 --> 01:32:26.502]  to 3 p.m.
[01:32:26.562 --> 01:32:28.522]  and then we have Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:32:28.642 --> 01:32:32.804]  You're on the air.
[01:32:32.864 --> 01:32:35.704]  Hey Alex and all the Info Wars, can you hear me?
[01:32:35.744 --> 01:32:36.825]  Yes sir, I can!
[01:32:40.747 --> 01:32:41.808]  Thank God!
[01:32:42.069 --> 01:32:53.225]  Literally, I have waited and I've been, I'm a very patient man and I'm a man of God and I'm a man of Christ and I believe that we can look
[01:33:06.832 --> 01:33:09.573]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.439 --> 01:33:29.381]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.302 --> 01:33:36.885]  Alright, we've got some military, police, active duty, retired.
[01:33:36.905 --> 01:33:39.267]  I'm going to put the phones up in general now.
[01:33:39.287 --> 01:33:52.678]  We're going to take their calls in that order, but for everybody to give your take on Trump set to declare a national emergency, a true national emergency, in his power and capacity as Commander-in-Chief, 10 U.S.
[01:33:52.738 --> 01:33:59.243]  Code Chapter 252, Use of Militia and Armed Forces to Enforce Federal Authority.
[01:33:59.263 --> 01:34:01.605]  I'm going to explain something again.
[01:34:02.802 --> 01:34:07.184]  I know you all know this, but when you see this in the news, they demonize Trump when he does this in the next few weeks.
[01:34:07.844 --> 01:34:09.505]  They're gonna call him a dictator, all this stuff.
[01:34:09.585 --> 01:34:09.745]  No.
[01:34:10.266 --> 01:34:13.647]  He'd be aiding and abetting the UN in collapsing the country if he didn't do this.
[01:34:14.147 --> 01:34:18.709]  In fact, I think he's waited too long, quite frankly, but Trump's probably smarter than I am.
[01:34:18.729 --> 01:34:19.770]  I think it's safe to say.
[01:34:20.210 --> 01:34:21.091]  We'll see what happens.
[01:34:21.151 --> 01:34:21.951]  I trust the President.
[01:34:22.591 --> 01:34:26.993]  But we are overrun with disease, with lawlessness.
[01:34:27.414 --> 01:34:29.935]  The poor people being brought in are the ones being exploited.
[01:34:30.675 --> 01:34:33.297]  The coyotes are now operating all over the United States.
[01:34:33.877 --> 01:34:37.719]  Upwards of 30% of the so-called families are fake.
[01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:39.620]  It's people who kidnap children.
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:42.362]  A lot of times they just dump the children off in the middle of nowhere.
[01:34:42.822 --> 01:34:43.663]  Those are the lucky ones.
[01:34:43.763 --> 01:34:45.684]  Others get sold into sex slavery.
[01:34:46.104 --> 01:34:48.126]  This is Senate reports.
[01:34:48.706 --> 01:34:53.369]  Upwards of half of all federal crimes committed by non-citizens last year.
[01:34:55.458 --> 01:34:57.279]  The President, I think, is doing the right thing.
[01:34:57.299 --> 01:34:58.219]  I'm going to read the U.S.
[01:34:58.239 --> 01:34:58.979]  Code to you in a moment.
[01:34:58.999 --> 01:35:00.140]  Go right back to your calls.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:01.940]  The number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:02.660]  877-789-2539.
[01:35:02.721 --> 01:35:10.363]  We're going to go to Mike and Debbie and Andrew and Brad here in just a moment.
[01:35:10.483 --> 01:35:12.884]  First off, let me just spend a second on this.
[01:35:14.565 --> 01:35:15.305]  I'm not a victim.
[01:35:16.305 --> 01:35:16.865]  I'm a target.
[01:35:17.386 --> 01:35:18.506]  But I am very competitive.
[01:35:19.707 --> 01:35:33.077]  And I get so focused on news and information that I barely get focused on cutting cool ads for the products or even reading reviews of how great they are and doing things I know will sell the product.
[01:35:34.298 --> 01:35:36.780]  But I don't want to sit here and spend the time talking about our products.
[01:35:37.981 --> 01:35:40.643]  We have the best B12 you're going to find anywhere.
[01:35:41.044 --> 01:35:41.344]  Period.
[01:35:42.776 --> 01:35:47.860]  We have the best turmeric, the highest rated, very best you're going to find anywhere.
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:50.182]  If you don't know what turmeric does for you, research it.
[01:35:51.323 --> 01:35:55.567]  We have the highest rated krill, the highest rated fish oil for adults and children.
[01:35:55.967 --> 01:35:59.770]  We have the highest rated, best, purest iodine in the world.
[01:36:00.111 --> 01:36:02.312]  No one even ever tried to go get the clean stuff.
[01:36:03.473 --> 01:36:04.294]  I guess you have to get a DEA
[01:36:05.854 --> 01:36:08.136]  Certification has to be a DEA approved facility.
[01:36:08.176 --> 01:36:09.036]  It's got to be locked up.
[01:36:10.017 --> 01:36:12.458]  The point is, we've done some things nobody else has done.
[01:36:13.199 --> 01:36:13.499]  Okay?
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:18.662]  And we have produced and brought you the products that nobody else has.
[01:36:19.903 --> 01:36:21.404]  And they're just game changers.
[01:36:21.964 --> 01:36:27.488]  And that's why people ask, why is BBC and Channel 4 and ABC attacking you every day?
[01:36:27.808 --> 01:36:28.769]  Why are they so obsessed?
[01:36:29.069 --> 01:36:30.850]  Because, folks, I've got their damn number.
[01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:31.210]  Okay?
[01:36:31.230 --> 01:36:32.031]  And I'm not bragging.
[01:36:33.672 --> 01:36:34.853]  It's not hard to get their number.
[01:36:35.694 --> 01:36:42.778]  There's just so much chatter and disinfo that if anybody listens to what we're saying and goes and looks it up, they're going to know the truth and it's game over.
[01:36:43.839 --> 01:36:52.604]  And they really want the show shut down because people in Congress and the military tune into regular shows and they're like, these people don't know what they're talking about.
[01:36:53.404 --> 01:36:55.826]  People tune in here, they go, wow, this guy's done his homework.
[01:36:57.186 --> 01:36:58.647]  And our guests have done their homework.
[01:37:00.368 --> 01:37:02.570]  And the system doesn't like that.
[01:37:04.110 --> 01:37:04.851]  So I'll say it again.
[01:37:07.737 --> 01:37:15.140]  I don't want to sit here and make the enemy happy about all the things they've done to us and their and their operation that slowed us down to a standstill.
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:15.900]  I don't like it.
[01:37:17.521 --> 01:37:18.841]  But at the same time, it's a catch 22.
[01:37:19.041 --> 01:37:20.202]  If I don't tell you, you won't know.
[01:37:20.702 --> 01:37:21.943]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[01:37:22.783 --> 01:37:22.983]  But
[01:37:25.051 --> 01:37:39.631]  I'm reaching a point where I have to spend inordinate amounts of time funding the operation, which, God, if I knew this 10 years ago back, I used to make money so easy and I just made the money I needed to run things and then never tried to get a bunch of extra, which was just stupid.
[01:37:40.652 --> 01:37:42.374]  Because now, the things I know now,
[01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:50.514]  If I'd have done back then, we would just be in a 10-story building and have a helicopter to go cover news, and we'd be in a much stronger position.
[01:37:50.854 --> 01:37:56.577]  But I had this, you know, kind of conservative thing of, well, I'll just make the money I need to run things now, and I don't want to be a big shot.
[01:37:57.118 --> 01:37:58.038]  We are big shots.
[01:37:58.338 --> 01:37:59.659]  We're in the enemy's crosshairs.
[01:38:00.199 --> 01:38:01.680]  And now I'm in one hell of a fight.
[01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:04.542]  So, thanks for your financial support.
[01:38:05.743 --> 01:38:08.464]  But let me tell you, we got really good fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:38:08.484 --> 01:38:09.885]  A lot of people go, man, this is really strong.
[01:38:10.774 --> 01:38:14.355]  Yeah, I'm the type of guy that, and I'll go to your calls, but I'm going to talk all day about this.
[01:38:14.375 --> 01:38:18.356]  I'm the type of person that goes, um, the average toothpaste is half filler.
[01:38:19.816 --> 01:38:20.616]  Now, I don't want any filler.
[01:38:21.456 --> 01:38:23.217]  The factory's like, it's going to be really strong.
[01:38:25.417 --> 01:38:26.957]  Half your normal toothpaste is just sand.
[01:38:28.338 --> 01:38:30.418]  So, or take our protein bars.
[01:38:30.458 --> 01:38:31.058]  They're really great.
[01:38:31.078 --> 01:38:31.698]  Everybody loves them.
[01:38:31.738 --> 01:38:32.419]  They're a high-end bar.
[01:38:32.759 --> 01:38:36.219]  A lot of folks go, man, these are really rich and it takes a while to eat them.
[01:38:36.719 --> 01:38:39.020]  I've never had a protein bar like this because there's no filler.
[01:38:41.894 --> 01:38:45.138]  And people have been eating fillers so long, they don't know what solid stuff tastes like.
[01:38:45.879 --> 01:38:46.339]  People love it.
[01:38:46.379 --> 01:38:49.523]  It's got, you know, 4.6 star reviews.
[01:38:49.943 --> 01:38:50.864]  All I'm getting at here is...
[01:38:51.889 --> 01:38:52.990]  We got a lot of great products.
[01:38:53.130 --> 01:38:54.351]  Just go try them.
[01:38:54.531 --> 01:38:55.912]  If you like them, sign up for auto ships.
[01:38:55.932 --> 01:38:58.353]  You don't forget to support us and forget to get great products.
[01:38:58.754 --> 01:39:00.054]  Try our Wake Up America coffee.
[01:39:00.975 --> 01:39:01.896]  Just, you know, get it.
[01:39:01.976 --> 01:39:05.778]  See how amazing it is and know that you're funding the second American revolution.
[01:39:06.259 --> 01:39:08.120]  But it takes a lot of money to do this.
[01:39:09.261 --> 01:39:13.163]  A midtown newspaper in like a city of 500,000 usually costs $20 million to run.
[01:39:16.331 --> 01:39:16.611]  Okay.
[01:39:17.191 --> 01:39:24.915]  Well, we reach hundreds of times what some local paper does around the world, and it takes more than that for us to operate, with the bandwidth and everything else.
[01:39:24.955 --> 01:39:25.695]  And I'm not bitching.
[01:39:26.136 --> 01:39:26.876]  I'm not complaining.
[01:39:27.736 --> 01:39:30.457]  I'm just saying we need to stay on air, so thanks for your financial support.
[01:39:30.878 --> 01:39:32.478]  Infowarrestore.com.
[01:39:32.498 --> 01:39:39.242]  A lot of big specials in this weekend, like the free bottle of X3 Tri-Iodine with your bottle of X2, so please take advantage.
[01:39:39.262 --> 01:39:39.962]  Okay, I'm done plugging.
[01:39:41.653 --> 01:39:42.694]  Let's go to your calls here.
[01:39:42.714 --> 01:39:45.015]  Boy, the phones are loaded up now, military and police.
[01:39:46.095 --> 01:39:47.096]  Who should we go to next?
[01:39:47.116 --> 01:39:48.536]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[01:39:49.897 --> 01:39:52.478]  With my little feeble eyeballs trying to figure it out here.
[01:39:52.498 --> 01:39:54.879]  I really, again, appreciate you calling in here.
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:57.541]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[01:39:58.713 --> 01:40:00.715]  Let's talk to Mike in Florida.
[01:40:00.835 --> 01:40:05.258]  Air Force wants to comment on the border and the censorship that's going on.
[01:40:05.818 --> 01:40:09.902]  Do you think Trump's wrong to put the trial balloon out to declare a national emergency?
[01:40:09.942 --> 01:40:11.243]  I think he's a day late.
[01:40:11.323 --> 01:40:11.723]  What do you think?
[01:40:12.924 --> 01:40:14.505]  Well, he's absolutely a day late, Alex.
[01:40:14.545 --> 01:40:16.747]  But here's the issue, and you know about this as well.
[01:40:17.307 --> 01:40:22.971]  The reason this has taken so long and it's gotten so bad is because of the censorship issue.
[01:40:23.011 --> 01:40:27.795]  You know when people have good information, they can make good decisions and support
[01:40:28.314 --> 01:40:29.034]  Good initiative.
[01:40:29.355 --> 01:40:34.978]  When they don't, and they have the fake news out there constantly putting out the nonsense, they're gonna be confused.
[01:40:35.058 --> 01:40:38.079]  And a confused mind, Alex, does nothing and stays idle.
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:39.360]  That's the issue.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:47.185]  And that's why I called in, because my page on Facebook that gets over a million organic hits a month now was just censored just an hour ago.
[01:40:47.225 --> 01:40:48.265]  That's why I called in.
[01:40:48.285 --> 01:40:48.725]  Of course.
[01:40:48.745 --> 01:40:51.347]  Because we cover all this stuff on that Facebook page.
[01:40:51.727 --> 01:40:53.108]  So that's what's going on here, Alex.
[01:40:53.128 --> 01:40:54.128]  You fix the censorship.
[01:40:54.168 --> 01:40:54.829]  You fix everything.
[01:40:54.869 --> 01:40:56.109]  That's why it's the First Amendment.
[01:40:56.330 --> 01:40:56.970]  Very important.
[01:40:57.370 --> 01:40:58.290]  Oh, I totally agree.
[01:40:58.330 --> 01:40:59.391]  And that's why I said the four pillars.
[01:40:59.951 --> 01:41:00.651]  Defend the border.
[01:41:01.071 --> 01:41:03.052]  Stop the censorship, which is election meddling.
[01:41:03.392 --> 01:41:05.412]  Stop the Federal Reserve from plunging the economy.
[01:41:06.233 --> 01:41:09.514]  And don't let the neocons start a new war while our country's being invaded.
[01:41:11.154 --> 01:41:11.354]  Right.
[01:41:11.774 --> 01:41:11.954]  Right.
[01:41:11.994 --> 01:41:17.096]  Because as things are being censored, they're able to do what they do in the background, in the shadows.
[01:41:17.216 --> 01:41:20.957]  Once it's brought to light, all the cockroaches will stir you underneath the furniture.
[01:41:20.977 --> 01:41:21.597]  No, I totally agree.
[01:41:21.617 --> 01:41:23.798]  But let me just throw this out here right now, because I keep forgetting to say this.
[01:41:24.804 --> 01:41:26.425]  I want the Venezuelan dictator gone.
[01:41:27.326 --> 01:41:28.807]  And I don't like the Iranian mullahs.
[01:41:28.827 --> 01:41:31.669]  But right now, the globalists are trying to get us in wars.
[01:41:31.729 --> 01:41:32.930]  I'm totally against these wars.
[01:41:33.290 --> 01:41:39.054]  Because if your castle is being overrun and you're being attacked, you don't launch an attack on a castle 500 miles away.
[01:41:39.074 --> 01:41:39.895]  Does that make sense?
[01:41:40.736 --> 01:41:40.956]  Right.
[01:41:41.056 --> 01:41:45.579]  No, you go to where the enemy is, where the threat is, and you neutralize it and you move on.
[01:41:45.879 --> 01:41:46.260]  Absolutely.
[01:41:48.021 --> 01:41:50.262]  So, why do you think Trump hasn't acted yet?
[01:41:50.282 --> 01:41:53.605]  I think he's paralyzed by his limp-wristed advisors.
[01:41:54.750 --> 01:41:55.250]  Absolutely.
[01:41:55.470 --> 01:42:01.192]  When you're in the swamp, when you're in the rat's nest, you've got to understand where he is and what he's surrounded by.
[01:42:01.572 --> 01:42:03.693]  He's not walking through a field of flowers, Alex.
[01:42:03.713 --> 01:42:04.953]  He is in the swamp.
[01:42:05.233 --> 01:42:06.894]  Oh, there's vipers all around him?
[01:42:07.474 --> 01:42:07.894]  Believe me.
[01:42:07.974 --> 01:42:08.834]  Absolutely.
[01:42:08.894 --> 01:42:23.159]  The evil advisors, the neocons, the fake Republicans, all these people that are very bad and have been in the system for so long that they're so compromised that they have no choice for themselves, they believe, just to continue
[01:42:23.639 --> 01:42:26.860]  The nonsense instead of actually doing what they need to do.
[01:42:26.961 --> 01:42:28.221]  They know what they need to do.
[01:42:28.561 --> 01:42:29.642]  But they're scared, Alex.
[01:42:29.662 --> 01:42:30.502]  They've been doing this for a while.
[01:42:30.522 --> 01:42:30.762]  Exactly.
[01:42:30.862 --> 01:42:32.523]  And now, I mean, I've been thinking about this.
[01:42:32.563 --> 01:42:33.683]  This is a whole show we should do.
[01:42:33.723 --> 01:42:34.284]  Thank you for the call.
[01:42:34.324 --> 01:42:34.924]  God bless you, sir.
[01:42:35.264 --> 01:42:36.285]  I tell folks the name of your Facebook.
[01:42:36.305 --> 01:42:37.665]  I don't even want to plug your Facebook.
[01:42:37.685 --> 01:42:38.906]  They'll ban it for good if you plug it.
[01:42:39.146 --> 01:42:40.086]  You want to plug your Facebook?
[01:42:42.227 --> 01:42:43.107]  Yeah.
[01:42:43.147 --> 01:42:43.968]  Let me just say this.
[01:42:43.988 --> 01:42:45.308]  I'm going to come back and take your calls.
[01:42:45.348 --> 01:42:45.829]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:42:47.089 --> 01:42:48.470]  What if we just leave the borders open?
[01:42:48.930 --> 01:42:50.531]  And just say, fine, hundreds of millions.
[01:42:50.591 --> 01:42:50.951]  I mean,
[01:42:52.615 --> 01:42:52.736]  What?
[01:42:53.557 --> 01:42:55.963]  I mean, what do the Democrats get what they want?
[01:42:55.983 --> 01:42:58.067]  600 million is what the UN wants?
[01:42:58.829 --> 01:43:00.192]  That's double our population!
[01:43:00.232 --> 01:43:00.994]  That's insane!
[01:43:02.196 --> 01:43:03.098]  The globalists are...
[01:43:12.515 --> 01:43:21.080]  Yeah, I really appreciate you, and it's an honor to talk to you, and I do, before I start, I also wanted to do a plug for a couple of your products that I really love, changed my life.
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:23.602]  The DNA Force is one, and X2.
[01:43:23.642 --> 01:43:25.343]  You know, I do a lot of construction.
[01:43:25.363 --> 01:43:32.827]  Using the tools that you're using, it just really wreaks havoc on your body, and I had three of my fingers starting to go numb, and I didn't think there was anything going to work on them.
[01:43:34.568 --> 01:43:39.692]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:43:39.712 --> 01:43:47.178]  I mean, we want to sell you stuff that works.
[01:43:47.218 --> 01:43:53.763]  You want to order it again, but PQQ CoQ10 has been proven to make telomeres last longer, to make nerves regrow.
[01:43:53.923 --> 01:43:56.105]  It really is an amazing product for anybody above 40.
[01:43:56.325 --> 01:43:59.468]  Young people can take it as well, but yes, DNA Force Plus is amazing.
[01:43:59.608 --> 01:44:00.649]  What did you think of the X2?
[01:44:01.169 --> 01:44:02.009]  I love that, too.
[01:44:02.429 --> 01:44:06.251]  After a few months of being on that, I felt like I wasn't searching for words.
[01:44:06.671 --> 01:44:15.333]  There was a time in my life where I felt like, man, I don't know if I'm just too exhausted or what, but you feel like you want to get in a conversation, and you're pausing, and you can't find the word to say.
[01:44:15.473 --> 01:44:18.594]  And I swear, man, that X2 really helps with cognition.
[01:44:18.614 --> 01:44:21.395]  Well, that's because the synapses in the brain operate off of it.
[01:44:21.415 --> 01:44:22.135]  It's electrochemical.
[01:44:22.155 --> 01:44:22.936]  You're absolutely right.
[01:44:22.976 --> 01:44:26.677]  When I forget to take X2 every couple of days, sometimes I forget for like a week because I get busy.
[01:44:26.797 --> 01:44:29.338]  Then I feel it, and I take it, and it really is amazing.
[01:44:29.418 --> 01:44:30.538]  So thank you for the support, brother.
[01:44:34.057 --> 01:44:35.919]  Breaking news out of Silicon Valley.
[01:44:35.979 --> 01:44:40.743]  Facebook has banned a number of prominent conspiracy theorists and alt-right figures.
[01:44:40.783 --> 01:44:44.386]  Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its platform.
[01:44:44.486 --> 01:44:48.429]  This may be one of the biggest and most impactful decisions Facebook has ever made.
[01:44:48.549 --> 01:44:51.572]  Facebook taking steps to enforce its hate speech policies.
[01:44:51.692 --> 01:44:58.818]  Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Louis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, all of them were designated dangerous.
[01:44:58.938 --> 01:44:59.418]  Dangerous.
[01:44:59.458 --> 01:45:00.019]  Dangerous.
[01:45:00.059 --> 01:45:00.519]  Dangerous.
[01:45:00.579 --> 01:45:01.180]  Dangerous.
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:02.841]  Dangerous individuals.
[01:45:02.861 --> 01:45:03.981]  Dangerous individuals.
[01:45:04.061 --> 01:45:06.662]  Dangerous individuals and organizations.
[01:45:06.722 --> 01:45:09.363]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous.
[01:45:09.423 --> 01:45:10.423]  Danger, Will Robinson.
[01:45:10.523 --> 01:45:10.983]  Danger.
[01:45:11.123 --> 01:45:12.164]  They call me dangerous.
[01:45:12.284 --> 01:45:13.664]  Danger is my middle name.
[01:45:13.904 --> 01:45:15.745]  Dangerous like hurting other people?
[01:45:15.985 --> 01:45:19.206]  Or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like?
[01:45:19.326 --> 01:45:23.931]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[01:45:24.011 --> 01:45:25.533]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[01:45:25.693 --> 01:45:30.218]  What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[01:45:30.298 --> 01:45:32.820]  InfoWars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.902]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[01:45:35.023 --> 01:45:37.245]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[01:45:37.766 --> 01:45:40.048]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[01:45:40.188 --> 01:45:41.209]  I want them shut down.
[01:45:41.269 --> 01:45:42.211]  I want them silenced.
[01:45:42.231 --> 01:45:43.012]  I want them muted.
[01:45:43.072 --> 01:45:44.894]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:45:45.074 --> 01:45:46.396]  I want them shut down!
[01:45:46.776 --> 01:45:47.918]  I want them silenced!
[01:45:48.018 --> 01:45:48.799]  I want them muted!
[01:45:48.899 --> 01:45:52.083]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal few.
[01:45:53.959 --> 01:46:11.763]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery surfaces aren't highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content, and we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist, primarily to violate our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[01:46:11.803 --> 01:46:12.563]  Screw your rules.
[01:46:12.823 --> 01:46:16.105]  Your rules go against our values, and they are patently un-American.
[01:46:16.205 --> 01:46:18.746]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[01:46:19.266 --> 01:46:23.268]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[01:46:23.468 --> 01:46:25.889]  We need a digital bill of rights.
[01:46:26.009 --> 01:46:29.690]  They're becoming the public square, and they control how we interact with each other.
[01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:36.933]  And if you think that you are going to throw up your hands and say, well, they're private companies, you are absolutely insane, and you are part of the problem.
[01:46:37.113 --> 01:46:38.213]  You are a bad person.
[01:46:38.253 --> 01:46:39.634]  You should be censored off the internet.
[01:46:39.674 --> 01:46:40.814]  Bad, yes!
[01:46:40.854 --> 01:46:41.855]  Get out of here, Alex!
[01:46:42.115 --> 01:46:46.497]  InfoWars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over at Trump's Twitter feed.
[01:46:46.617 --> 01:46:55.460]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the InfoWars president.
[01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:59.862]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:47:01.322 --> 01:47:02.843]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[01:47:06.224 --> 01:47:10.686]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:15.928 --> 01:47:21.190]  You lock the door, throw away the key.
[01:47:22.271 --> 01:47:26.553]  There's someone in my head, but it's not me.
[01:47:35.811 --> 01:47:44.758]  Leadership is doing the right thing when you know that when you first do it, the followers are going to get mad at you and you're going to be attacked by the criminals.
[01:47:45.378 --> 01:47:49.902]  But doing it, even though you know that you may get destroyed, in the end, it's the right thing to do.
[01:47:51.667 --> 01:47:57.151]  That's why back in September of last year, we wrote articles, I did a whole show saying Trump must declare martial law on the border.
[01:47:57.571 --> 01:48:06.837]  I use the controversial term because it means that the local law has failed, that the regular laws have failed, and that you are in a deep crisis.
[01:48:08.018 --> 01:48:13.842]  You know, Obama declared COG to open the border and to put stay-behind networks in to block Trump.
[01:48:14.482 --> 01:48:18.705]  I said Trump must declare a civil emergency to remove that under law.
[01:48:18.765 --> 01:48:19.806]  That's how you do it quickly.
[01:48:21.858 --> 01:48:23.059]  Trump planning mass arrest.
[01:48:23.079 --> 01:48:24.680]  Military tribunals for deep state traitors.
[01:48:25.621 --> 01:48:26.982]  Mike Adams wrote about that in September.
[01:48:27.022 --> 01:48:29.764]  Said Trump needs to declare martial law.
[01:48:30.425 --> 01:48:35.929]  He's written a new article that if you read it and you're ignorant, sounds very authoritarian.
[01:48:38.511 --> 01:48:50.741]  It's not authoritarian if you come home and you see your front door open and your wife's hogtied and God forbid some criminal psychotic is raping your daughter.
[01:48:51.994 --> 01:49:00.158]  It's not authoritarian when you use the instincts God gave you to grab that person and break their neck in two seconds.
[01:49:00.839 --> 01:49:02.519]  Which the average person would just kill like that.
[01:49:02.539 --> 01:49:03.260]  Used to have a governor.
[01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:06.602]  I'll assure you, if you ever run into something like that, you'll be able to kill people just like that.
[01:49:07.702 --> 01:49:09.203]  The difference is, it's not authoritarian.
[01:49:09.323 --> 01:49:10.324]  You didn't break in the house.
[01:49:10.544 --> 01:49:12.245]  You weren't hog-tying people.
[01:49:12.665 --> 01:49:14.866]  You weren't the psychotic that was attacking your family.
[01:49:15.326 --> 01:49:18.688]  But when the decisive moment came, you executed against the enemy.
[01:49:20.475 --> 01:49:22.838]  Mike Adams has written a new article that's on Infowars.com.
[01:49:22.858 --> 01:49:23.558]  We just posted it.
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:26.962]  That is actually a normal, real battle plan.
[01:49:27.343 --> 01:49:30.026]  This is what you would do if our government wasn't full of criminals.
[01:49:30.706 --> 01:49:36.613]  It admits that China runs California, China runs Hollywood, and what President Trump needs to do in a real emergency.
[01:49:38.295 --> 01:49:41.879]  Because this country's already so far gone, this is probably the only type of thing that actually could save it.
[01:49:42.964 --> 01:49:44.845]  So again, we don't like martial law, folks.
[01:49:44.865 --> 01:49:46.025]  This is what we've already been in.
[01:49:46.285 --> 01:49:50.187]  We're already under a martial law that's Hollywood, shycom run, trying to start a race war.
[01:49:51.047 --> 01:49:53.428]  And Mike's done a great job putting this article out.
[01:49:53.788 --> 01:49:56.089]  It's now up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:57.229]  I'll try to get him to pop in.
[01:49:57.249 --> 01:49:59.390]  We'll go right back to your phone calls.
[01:49:59.450 --> 01:50:05.132]  But millions are pouring in, diseases, crime, society's breaking down.
[01:50:05.172 --> 01:50:06.073]  We're going bankrupt.
[01:50:07.073 --> 01:50:09.214]  Democrat Internal Documents admits that's the plan.
[01:50:10.512 --> 01:50:13.473]  Congress won't act, so what does the President do under the Constitution?
[01:50:13.573 --> 01:50:17.635]  Article 4, Section 4, as we pointed out here.
[01:50:19.096 --> 01:50:21.017]  Okay, let's go to Brad, who's U.S.
[01:50:21.057 --> 01:50:24.918]  Navy, on topic of the border being imploded and immigration.
[01:50:24.978 --> 01:50:27.960]  What do you think of what the President should do, and what's your view on this?
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:28.560]  Thanks for calling.
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:30.941]  Well, hey, thanks, Alex.
[01:50:30.981 --> 01:50:35.543]  The first thing I wanted to say is that I auto-ship turbo-force to my house.
[01:50:36.183 --> 01:50:38.264]  My wife, who's a nurse here in Boston,
[01:50:39.016 --> 01:50:42.138]  At a big hospital in a city that's known for big hospitals.
[01:50:42.559 --> 01:50:44.240]  She takes it to work every day with her.
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:46.042]  So I want to thank you for that product.
[01:50:46.122 --> 01:50:46.882]  It's outstanding.
[01:50:47.102 --> 01:50:47.623]  Thank you, sir.
[01:50:47.703 --> 01:50:53.367]  Just since you're plugging it, we set out to make the cleanest long burn energy with vitamins and minerals.
[01:50:53.487 --> 01:50:55.869]  It's nobody puts this much product in a packet.
[01:50:55.889 --> 01:50:56.970]  They just mark them up hugely.
[01:50:57.310 --> 01:51:04.176]  We believe this is probably the best long term work, pre workout, long term healthy energy, whatever you want to call it.
[01:51:04.216 --> 01:51:06.037]  We believe this is probably the best thing on the market.
[01:51:06.257 --> 01:51:07.158]  I mean, what do you think?
[01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:10.642]  Well, I think it's awesome because it doesn't have a ton of sugar in it.
[01:51:10.782 --> 01:51:13.764]  I mean, that's, that's, for me, that's, that's the selling point.
[01:51:13.824 --> 01:51:15.425]  Like, it's got, what, four grams?
[01:51:15.465 --> 01:51:17.306]  I mean, it's got a tiny amount of sugar in it.
[01:51:17.506 --> 01:51:21.028]  And I even argued against it, but it tastes horrible without that.
[01:51:21.149 --> 01:51:22.429]  So, yeah.
[01:51:22.489 --> 01:51:23.890]  No, I can imagine it would.
[01:51:24.311 --> 01:51:27.993]  But no, you can put it in your, in your, uh, in your water or hot water, cold water.
[01:51:28.013 --> 01:51:29.294]  You can put it in iced tea or whatever.
[01:51:29.314 --> 01:51:29.954]  I mean, it's good.
[01:51:30.335 --> 01:51:30.855]  So I dig it.
[01:51:30.915 --> 01:51:37.019]  But I wanted to, uh, yeah, I wanted, I wanted to talk about the, uh, the immigration policy because,
[01:51:37.762 --> 01:51:44.685]  Look, we're probably going to disagree on this, but the thing is, you know, I'm second generation American.
[01:51:45.125 --> 01:51:46.205]  My grandmother came here.
[01:51:46.225 --> 01:51:48.226]  I'm her first grandson.
[01:51:48.606 --> 01:51:50.107]  She came from Ireland with no skills.
[01:51:50.727 --> 01:52:00.311]  Under this policy right now that Trump is pushing, we would not, you know, Matilda Riley would not actually get to come to this country.
[01:52:00.471 --> 01:52:02.091]  And I think that's jacked up, man.
[01:52:02.211 --> 01:52:02.831]  I can't do it.
[01:52:03.572 --> 01:52:04.132]  I understand
[01:52:04.795 --> 01:52:07.216]  The idea of trying to control immigration.
[01:52:07.396 --> 01:52:25.840]  I'm not against it, I hear you, but you just can't do that because what's going to happen is people like my grandmother who came here and raised seven children, all of whom are successful and have raised, I don't even know how many grandkids, right?
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:26.821]  I'm just one of them, right?
[01:52:27.881 --> 01:52:29.221]  What, we can't come to America?
[01:52:29.521 --> 01:52:30.202]  I'm not an American.
[01:52:30.302 --> 01:52:31.622]  I served five years in the U.S.
[01:52:31.662 --> 01:52:31.862]  Navy.
[01:52:32.552 --> 01:52:35.734]  I wouldn't have served those years if this policy worked.
[01:52:36.074 --> 01:52:41.137]  Well, Brad, first off, Brad, you're an American and you have a First Amendment and you're a well-spoken person.
[01:52:41.878 --> 01:52:53.404]  The difference is, when your grandmother came here, or her parents, is that they didn't have welfare and communist indoctrination shoved on them the second they got off the boat.
[01:52:53.905 --> 01:52:55.125]  They weren't given anything.
[01:52:56.286 --> 01:52:59.088]  A. B, they were screened for diseases.
[01:52:59.188 --> 01:53:00.489]  That's not even being done now.
[01:53:01.303 --> 01:53:01.643]  Okay.
[01:53:02.283 --> 01:53:05.204]  And so, and they were documented and brought into the system.
[01:53:05.924 --> 01:53:08.144]  So you add that trifecta to this.
[01:53:09.385 --> 01:53:17.226]  What Trump is saying is, is that there's a lawless total collapse and no order to any of this.
[01:53:17.266 --> 01:53:18.806]  So no one's judging you.
[01:53:18.826 --> 01:53:24.507]  I mean, the average person coming here out of Latin America is a nice, hardworking person fleeing tyranny.
[01:53:24.528 --> 01:53:24.888]  And I get it.
[01:53:24.908 --> 01:53:25.488]  They're unskilled.
[01:53:25.528 --> 01:53:25.908]  Doesn't matter.
[01:53:25.928 --> 01:53:26.548]  They'll get skilled.
[01:53:27.441 --> 01:53:28.581]  I don't sit there and hate these people.
[01:53:29.281 --> 01:53:35.923]  The issue is, the globalists have made the calculation to do this now, to completely bring the country down, and there's no law and order.
[01:53:36.583 --> 01:53:43.084]  So when I fly in, say, from England, and ICE wants to ask me a question, do I say, F you, and I just run through the deal?
[01:53:43.805 --> 01:53:48.206]  I mean, because that's the system that's been created, where there's no border.
[01:53:48.706 --> 01:53:53.287]  When your grandmother or great-grandmother came here, Brad, there was basic controls.
[01:53:53.327 --> 01:53:54.387]  I mean, you recognize that, right?
[01:53:55.782 --> 01:53:57.263]  Yeah, there were basic controls.
[01:53:58.003 --> 01:53:59.924]  Basically, all you had to do was get here.
[01:54:00.284 --> 01:54:00.804]  That's the thing.
[01:54:00.824 --> 01:54:02.245]  That's why Ellis Island existed.
[01:54:02.565 --> 01:54:08.127]  I mean, the fact of the matter is, all you had to do was survive the travel.
[01:54:08.688 --> 01:54:10.548]  And you could get here... So let me ask you this.
[01:54:10.568 --> 01:54:11.449]  I'm going to say it again.
[01:54:11.509 --> 01:54:15.271]  Your grandmother, there was no welfare when your grandmother... Was it grandmother?
[01:54:15.331 --> 01:54:16.091]  Red grandmother came here.
[01:54:17.097 --> 01:54:19.520]  My grandmother came here, it was 1929, there was no welfare.
[01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:20.561]  Okay, so there was no welfare.
[01:54:20.601 --> 01:54:21.221]  I'm going to say it again.
[01:54:21.862 --> 01:54:25.546]  You understand, even Bernie Sanders says, which is surprising, he told the truth.
[01:54:25.886 --> 01:54:33.894]  He says if you have socialism and you have welfare and you have anchor baby status, we will go bankrupt.
[01:54:34.255 --> 01:54:38.839]  Your grandmother and her husband and all that, I guarantee you'll work their ass off, okay?
[01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:39.900]  Those are great people.
[01:54:40.521 --> 01:54:49.210]  You understand you can't have welfare in a nanny state and bring in all these people because they're immediately stuck on that and it bankrupts the country.
[01:54:49.410 --> 01:54:51.492]  I mean, so welfare didn't exist.
[01:54:51.572 --> 01:54:52.513]  Do you understand that equation?
[01:54:53.354 --> 01:54:54.655]  No, I do understand that.
[01:54:54.695 --> 01:54:56.136]  But so what's the what's the position?
[01:54:56.156 --> 01:54:59.840]  We're going to we're going to keep the welfare state, but we're going to change the immigration law.
[01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:01.722]  No, no.
[01:55:01.942 --> 01:55:03.583]  Oh, if we got rid of the welfare state.
[01:55:04.383 --> 01:55:07.004]  And had it be local and churches, which used to run really well by the way.
[01:55:07.024 --> 01:55:10.706]  You know, the average doctor, you're just supposed to do half their work for free.
[01:55:11.066 --> 01:55:12.206]  You were taught that in medical school.
[01:55:12.386 --> 01:55:12.987]  They don't do that now.
[01:55:13.587 --> 01:55:16.608]  So listen, all I'm telling you, here's an example.
[01:55:17.609 --> 01:55:25.972]  The UN, in their official report, we can pull this up, UN wants 600 million replacement migrants for the United States the next 40 years.
[01:55:26.392 --> 01:55:28.513]  You think we can take 600 million people, brother?
[01:55:28.753 --> 01:55:30.274]  That's double our current population.
[01:55:30.474 --> 01:55:30.994]  That's 900 plus million.
[01:55:33.243 --> 01:55:34.564]  No, I don't think that.
[01:55:34.864 --> 01:55:41.466]  Look, my point basically is, look, I live in the city of Boston, right?
[01:55:41.846 --> 01:55:47.128]  We have an outrageous amount of illegal Irish immigrants, right?
[01:55:47.348 --> 01:55:48.249]  I happen to be Irish.
[01:55:48.469 --> 01:55:49.329]  I understand these guys.
[01:55:49.789 --> 01:55:53.491]  They come here, they're bartenders, they work in kitchens and all this stuff.
[01:55:53.651 --> 01:55:54.891]  Nobody gives a damn.
[01:55:54.991 --> 01:55:55.831]  Nobody cares.
[01:55:56.292 --> 01:55:57.232]  Nobody complains.
[01:55:57.739 --> 01:55:58.219]  It's alright.
[01:55:58.499 --> 01:56:04.601]  Except when you get a Mexican dishwasher and then we start to whine and piss and moan about it.
[01:56:05.081 --> 01:56:09.162]  Well listen, I know you're not in Boston, but I'm gonna tell you something.
[01:56:09.202 --> 01:56:12.503]  Mexico's got almost 300,000 dead people in the last 20 years.
[01:56:12.783 --> 01:56:14.144]  There's mass graves everywhere.
[01:56:14.404 --> 01:56:15.764]  You can't go most places in it.
[01:56:15.984 --> 01:56:18.465]  You can't even go to places that I've been going my whole life.
[01:56:18.885 --> 01:56:20.705]  So you understand Latin America's collapsing.
[01:56:20.725 --> 01:56:23.786]  You understand a thousand people starved to death a week in Venezuela.
[01:56:24.006 --> 01:56:26.447]  I mean, you understand that, like, Latin America's got big problems.
[01:56:26.832 --> 01:56:30.233]  Most of the time I spent in the military was in Latin America.
[01:56:30.253 --> 01:56:31.214]  You're absolutely right.
[01:56:31.774 --> 01:56:33.415]  You're not talking out of your ass.
[01:56:33.795 --> 01:56:34.755]  I totally understand it.
[01:56:35.155 --> 01:56:35.936]  But here's the deal.
[01:56:36.916 --> 01:56:40.778]  We have kind of a ridiculous idea about immigration right now.
[01:56:41.158 --> 01:56:43.919]  And I just think that Trump isn't helping right now.
[01:56:44.426 --> 01:56:46.329]  He's saying a merit-based thing?
[01:56:46.349 --> 01:56:47.210]  Merit-based thing?
[01:57:02.180 --> 01:57:10.267]  If we don't, let me explain something, the coyotes, the corrupt systems out of Mexico that have already overthrown their government in most areas, they're making deals with Democrats.
[01:57:10.907 --> 01:57:13.930]  They're creating these criminal networks inside the U.S.
[01:57:13.990 --> 01:57:16.191]  Listen, I spent 10 minutes with you, interesting call.
[01:57:17.212 --> 01:57:18.433]  I'm glad you called.
[01:57:18.673 --> 01:57:21.835]  We don't screen your calls other than your name, where you're calling from.
[01:57:21.895 --> 01:57:22.515]  You disagreed.
[01:57:22.815 --> 01:57:23.776]  You made the show interesting.
[01:57:24.236 --> 01:57:26.377]  So don't feel like you gotta say, hey, we're gonna disagree.
[01:57:26.737 --> 01:57:27.278]  I like the show.
[01:57:27.878 --> 01:57:28.538]  We get it, man.
[01:57:28.998 --> 01:57:29.699]  I get your points.
[01:57:29.719 --> 01:57:32.000]  You don't think I don't have a bleeding heart for people?
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:34.621]  I just know that globalists are for open borders.
[01:57:35.202 --> 01:57:36.583]  And we have lawlessness now.
[01:57:37.663 --> 01:57:41.528]  Cities are going bankrupt everywhere, and we're falling apart.
[01:57:42.069 --> 01:57:42.910]  Hour number two.
[01:57:43.331 --> 01:57:45.634]  I'm going right to your phone calls when we're back in two minutes.
[01:57:46.034 --> 01:57:50.700]  Debbie, Sanford, Mike, Anthony, David, Mike, Shelby, Andrew, stay with us.
[01:57:52.932 --> 01:58:02.397]  And this shocking footage is even more painful when you see the albatrosses of CNN and other MSM outlets cheering on the rape.
[01:58:03.078 --> 01:58:13.424]  In fact, it's been found that these systems actually direct the monstrous CEO, Zuckerberg, against the free speech enemies and anyone that tries to not submit.
[01:58:14.184 --> 01:58:25.895]  But most sad of all is other penguins in the independent media, simply looking up at the sky and ignoring the vicious rape of their own freedoms and birthright taking place right in front of them.
[01:58:27.236 --> 01:58:29.919]  After enduring over an hour of the assault,
[01:58:30.885 --> 01:58:33.248]  Our dear penguin finally succumbs.
[01:58:34.029 --> 01:58:46.563]  But one more vicious insult is heaped upon its broken body by CNN, as its identity is stolen, gobbled up and devoured, and uses a straw man to attack other penguins.
[01:58:49.266 --> 01:58:50.467]  This is CNN.
[01:58:55.732 --> 01:59:00.297]  We are in a complete war, and you idiots don't join with the republic, you fools!
[01:59:00.957 --> 01:59:03.740]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted.
[01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:05.742]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:59:06.743 --> 01:59:14.411]  Yes, now Facebook is going to be banning Alex Jones and InfoWars from not only their main platform, Facebook, but also from Instagram.
[01:59:14.431 --> 01:59:18.094]  President Trump, please save the First Amendment!
[01:59:18.955 --> 01:59:22.257]  Please do the right thing and stand up against Big Tech!
[01:59:22.678 --> 01:59:25.259]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:29.842]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[01:59:30.283 --> 01:59:31.584]  I want him shut down.
[01:59:31.684 --> 01:59:35.526]  We're losing the thread of the concepts that are important to this country.
[01:59:35.866 --> 01:59:39.509]  I don't like Alex Jones, but Alex Jones gets to speak.
[01:59:39.869 --> 01:59:40.910]  Everybody gets to speak.
[01:59:41.190 --> 01:59:42.151]  I'm a man of mercy!
[01:59:42.191 --> 01:59:42.871]  I question things!
[01:59:42.891 --> 01:59:43.451]  I'm evil!
[01:59:43.572 --> 01:59:43.972]  I don't...
[01:59:48.689 --> 01:59:50.190]  How dangerous is Infowars?
[01:59:55.294 --> 01:59:59.396]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.937 --> 02:00:01.218]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.943 --> 02:00:38.224]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[02:00:39.364 --> 02:00:40.005]  to 3 p.m.
[02:00:40.045 --> 02:00:41.265]  Central, I'm here live.
[02:00:41.345 --> 02:00:43.946]  Alex Jones, thank you for joining us.
[02:00:44.046 --> 02:00:46.146]  And Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m., I'm back live.
[02:00:46.947 --> 02:00:47.887]  The War Room, 3 p.m.
[02:00:47.907 --> 02:00:50.108]  every day, with Owen Troyer, who's back live today.
[02:00:50.628 --> 02:00:53.229]  And David Knight, doing a spectacular job.
[02:00:53.249 --> 02:00:56.450]  If you're into the cerebrum, from 8 a.m.
[02:00:58.228 --> 02:00:58.969]  To 11 a.m.
[02:00:59.029 --> 02:01:00.630]  right before we go live every day.
[02:01:01.710 --> 02:01:05.373]  So courageous to see the American people take action.
[02:01:08.675 --> 02:01:22.444]  The UN has announced, this is a message to the last caller, that they are trying to implode national borders and teach people that anyone has a right to go anywhere they want.
[02:01:23.345 --> 02:01:25.246]  Well once you come into a Western welfare state,
[02:01:26.277 --> 02:01:43.866]  Where everything's set up to be free for you if you don't want to work, you have an immediate domestic group now that's a client of the Socialists, who will administer the Socialism and make money off of it, all enslaving the society.
[02:01:45.367 --> 02:01:55.932]  And so you get all these cute little stories about Americans don't want to work and everybody, you know, just wants to be mean to the precious little immigrants.
[02:01:57.603 --> 02:02:04.788]  I hire people that are here on student visas and who do a good job, and I don't care what color you are.
[02:02:06.169 --> 02:02:08.111]  And so I literally don't look at what color people are.
[02:02:08.131 --> 02:02:10.853]  If they can do a decent job and are nice, they're hired.
[02:02:11.513 --> 02:02:14.856]  It has nothing to me to do with what color people are.
[02:02:15.797 --> 02:02:26.885]  It has to do with, I used to go to Mexico a couple times a year, because it's a quick two-hour flight from Austin, and it used to be cheap, and nice people, and go have a good time.
[02:02:28.752 --> 02:02:30.332]  And I'll drink tequila and listen to mariachi.
[02:02:32.273 --> 02:02:33.253]  It's not safe anywhere now.
[02:02:36.114 --> 02:02:37.174]  And that's coming here now.
[02:02:37.435 --> 02:02:39.375]  Latin America is collapsing.
[02:02:40.575 --> 02:02:45.057]  Industrial systems let populations grow five-fold what they were a hundred years ago.
[02:02:47.678 --> 02:02:49.278]  And now society's broke down here.
[02:02:49.858 --> 02:02:55.940]  Our young people, I don't care what color they are on average, are on drugs and are getting lazy and are involved in weird-ass crap.
[02:02:59.514 --> 02:03:09.356]  There's a lot of that going on now in Latin America, and the worst now, who've been promised a free ticket from the socialists, are coming here, and that's a fact!
[02:03:11.356 --> 02:03:14.117]  And I'm tired of paying for everybody.
[02:03:15.317 --> 02:03:27.919]  And I know our sworn enemies, the globalists that have already exploited these third world countries, and sucked their resources out, and put in dictators to manipulate them, and taught them socialism so they're idiots, are now going to use
[02:03:29.298 --> 02:03:34.585]  Countries they've already captured in an exploitive phase, that's a communist term, to now take us down.
[02:03:35.766 --> 02:03:44.518]  And the Weathermen and the Antifa founders are all in there at these refugee centers and at these Democrat centers brainwashing the living hell out of all these people.
[02:03:47.355 --> 02:03:49.496]  And now pointing them at America.
[02:03:50.056 --> 02:04:00.959]  And I've got stacks of articles every day that I don't even get into where every university says, whites are inherently evil, and white people stand up and say, I'm evil, I won't have kids, I'm sorry, I'm bad.
[02:04:01.339 --> 02:04:04.240]  And then the whites and the minorities go, yes, you're evil!
[02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:06.560]  Thank you for decrying that you're a bad person!
[02:04:08.341 --> 02:04:13.682]  When all this collapses, all these slugs, all these lazy virtue-signalers aren't going to have any future.
[02:04:15.743 --> 02:04:16.663]  They're not going to have anything.
[02:04:18.151 --> 02:04:21.192]  You know, there's a video that I sent to the crew.
[02:04:21.232 --> 02:04:26.734]  I said, I don't want to just air old stuff from three years ago of leftists freaking out or two years ago.
[02:04:26.774 --> 02:04:28.355]  I said, put up together all the new stuff.
[02:04:29.415 --> 02:04:43.200]  And they said, boss, it's going to be like a five-parter if it's only going to be a few minutes long, because there's so many leftists physically attacking people and going crazy and going nuts and deciding everybody deserves everything free, except if you're a citizen, you better pay more tax.
[02:04:45.609 --> 02:04:59.261]  So we come back, your calls, Mike Adams and the video that's gone viral as we speak on InfoWars.com that I hope Dragivy's listening links to is powerful when leftists attack Ultimate Compilation 2019.
[02:04:59.462 --> 02:05:00.563]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.603 --> 02:05:11.733]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[02:05:12.611 --> 02:05:16.379]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:20.608]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[02:05:26.260 --> 02:05:27.881]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[02:05:27.961 --> 02:05:28.941]  This is racketeering.
[02:05:29.182 --> 02:05:30.002]  This is cartels.
[02:05:30.302 --> 02:05:32.363]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[02:05:32.723 --> 02:05:34.084]  We need it now.
[02:05:34.584 --> 02:05:35.845]  You can take on Big Tech.
[02:05:36.285 --> 02:05:44.690]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[02:05:45.250 --> 02:05:53.034]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[02:05:53.274 --> 02:05:54.135]  The way to fight back
[02:05:54.735 --> 02:05:56.436]  When I grow up, I don't want to live in a communist country.
[02:05:56.456 --> 02:05:57.197]  I want to be a rock star!
[02:05:57.217 --> 02:06:00.500]  We now take you live to the front lines of the fight for what's left of the West.
[02:06:23.872 --> 02:06:32.337]  It's Friday, my friends, and we still are broadcasting in defiance of tyranny, and in some ways, bigger than ever, thanks to you!
[02:06:32.698 --> 02:06:38.741]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[02:06:39.162 --> 02:06:42.304]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:06:48.868 --> 02:06:51.930]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're living in an incredible time.
[02:06:53.854 --> 02:06:54.314]  The U.N.
[02:06:54.334 --> 02:07:11.460]  admits their world government plan is to flood Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., Canada, with brainwashed illegal aliens at refugee centers who are in six-month courses, taught to hate the West, that you're coming to conquer it, and that white people are bad and everything's free once you get there.
[02:07:12.260 --> 02:07:19.523]  This is the globalist plan, turning against the egalitarianism of the West, the Christianity of the West, that gave us things like Martin Luther King Jr.
[02:07:21.098 --> 02:07:22.143]  A total betrayal.
[02:07:22.645 --> 02:07:25.336]  And now Trump is set to declare a national emergency.
[02:07:26.622 --> 02:07:26.862]  U.S.
[02:07:26.902 --> 02:07:32.106]  Code Title 10 Chapter 252, Use of Militia Armed Forces to Enforce Federal Authority.
[02:07:32.446 --> 02:07:35.308]  This is the real emergency we've been talking about.
[02:07:35.348 --> 02:07:38.450]  Mike Adams has written a powerful article for nationalnews.com.
[02:07:38.490 --> 02:07:40.491]  It's posted to newswars.com.
[02:07:41.091 --> 02:07:43.473]  Please share it with everyone from newswars.com.
[02:07:44.373 --> 02:07:44.774]  Breaking!
[02:07:44.814 --> 02:07:46.014]  The fight for America begins.
[02:07:46.114 --> 02:07:51.918]  Trump to invoke insurrectional act that authorizes National Guard military action inside the U.S.
[02:07:51.958 --> 02:07:54.179]  because regular law has broken down.
[02:07:54.219 --> 02:07:54.680]  But first,
[02:07:56.001 --> 02:07:57.541]  This video's on newswars.com.
[02:07:58.002 --> 02:07:59.482]  This video's on infowars.com.
[02:07:59.542 --> 02:08:03.523]  It'll only get around the censors if you go get it and email it and text message it.
[02:08:04.523 --> 02:08:11.605]  This is a compilation, and we're gonna have part two next week, because there's so many, of when leftists attack 2019.
[02:08:12.226 --> 02:08:14.006]  Their hate, their viciousness.
[02:08:14.566 --> 02:08:16.027]  This is part of the course.
[02:08:16.047 --> 02:08:18.968]  So the enemy within, and the brainwashed horde without.
[02:08:19.368 --> 02:08:23.689]  Here's this clip, then we'll talk to Mike Adams about the historic developments.
[02:08:24.637 --> 02:08:27.299]  I'm gonna grow a magnificent pair of breasts.
[02:08:28.219 --> 02:08:30.901]  I'm going to transition into a woman.
[02:08:31.321 --> 02:08:31.981]  It'll be great.
[02:08:32.281 --> 02:08:44.709]  You should crawl back into your mother's rancid womb, gestate for a few more hours, slide back out, and then learn something about not being an entitled, white piece of s***.
[02:08:44.869 --> 02:08:46.049]  This is Trump, people.
[02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:48.291]  When the rubber meets the road,
[02:08:49.091 --> 02:08:49.913]  Pussies!
[02:08:50.013 --> 02:08:50.914]  Yeah, you're a f**king idiot.
[02:08:50.954 --> 02:08:51.896]  F**k you, capitalism!
[02:08:51.936 --> 02:08:53.117]  F**k you, f**king president!
[02:08:53.398 --> 02:08:55.822]  He's a racist, stupid piece of s**t!
[02:08:55.962 --> 02:08:59.347]  If you guys are working for Alex Jones, you're working for a murderer!
[02:08:59.788 --> 02:09:01.971]  Alex Jones is an a**hole.
[02:09:02.291 --> 02:09:04.475]  InfoWars is fake news.
[02:09:07.844 --> 02:09:08.764]  I got a chair going.
[02:09:08.944 --> 02:09:13.786]  If you had to choose one prominent person to be banned next, who would you choose?
[02:09:14.386 --> 02:09:14.627]  You.
[02:09:14.747 --> 02:09:17.168]  This is what's happening to the men in our country.
[02:09:17.188 --> 02:09:18.548]  Where are the men?
[02:09:18.588 --> 02:09:19.348]  Stop touching my stuff.
[02:09:19.368 --> 02:09:20.049]  I'm backing away.
[02:09:20.069 --> 02:09:20.189]  Stop.
[02:09:29.172 --> 02:09:31.373]  Hey, hey, hey, don't be doing that.
[02:09:31.413 --> 02:09:32.913]  Why are you doing that?
[02:09:32.974 --> 02:09:34.294]  What are you doing?
[02:09:34.314 --> 02:09:35.915]  Get the f***ing stuff in it!
[02:09:35.955 --> 02:09:36.835]  Don't film it!
[02:09:36.875 --> 02:09:38.376]  You're not allowed!
[02:09:38.396 --> 02:09:41.197]  You can't use it!
[02:09:41.217 --> 02:09:42.637]  Please do not touch me.
[02:09:42.737 --> 02:09:43.978]  Please do not touch me.
[02:09:44.338 --> 02:09:45.138]  Once again, it's me.
[02:09:45.739 --> 02:09:47.419]  I actually said both of you guys.
[02:09:47.499 --> 02:09:49.720]  Right beforehand, you f***ing said, sir!
[02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:53.202]  Yes, I have boobs drawn on my shirt because I'm a liberated woman!
[02:09:53.222 --> 02:09:53.502]  I am!
[02:09:53.642 --> 02:09:55.502]  Trump supporters!
[02:10:00.865 --> 02:10:01.545]  Take it outside!
[02:10:01.565 --> 02:10:03.646]  I will show you what you deserve!
[02:10:03.706 --> 02:10:04.886]  Motherfucker!
[02:10:04.926 --> 02:10:06.767]  Get the fuck out of my face!
[02:10:07.207 --> 02:10:08.128]  Go home!
[02:10:08.288 --> 02:10:08.888]  Go home!
[02:10:09.388 --> 02:10:10.788]  Go home!
[02:10:11.489 --> 02:10:12.949]  What's your fucking problem?
[02:10:12.969 --> 02:10:14.250]  What the fuck are you doing?
[02:10:14.330 --> 02:10:15.170]  Film it, bro.
[02:10:15.590 --> 02:10:16.650]  Film it.
[02:10:16.911 --> 02:10:18.551]  Yeah, I'm filming it.
[02:10:18.731 --> 02:10:23.253]  What the fuck did you do to me?
[02:10:23.993 --> 02:10:24.453]  How's this?
[02:10:24.653 --> 02:10:26.914]  Did you fart at us?
[02:10:31.539 --> 02:10:33.381]  Get the hell out of here!
[02:10:33.441 --> 02:10:37.945]  Get these people the hell out of here right now!
[02:10:38.005 --> 02:10:40.607]  F*** off!
[02:10:41.148 --> 02:10:46.572]  I don't give a f***!
[02:10:46.652 --> 02:10:47.333]  Get out!
[02:10:47.473 --> 02:10:47.753]  Oh, s***!
[02:10:47.773 --> 02:10:48.354]  Don't do that!
[02:10:48.394 --> 02:10:48.654]  Please!
[02:10:48.714 --> 02:10:49.235]  Please!
[02:10:49.295 --> 02:10:51.297]  F***ing terrible person!
[02:10:51.397 --> 02:10:51.877]  Please!
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:11:07.306]  Now, this is programming by the media of the universities to turn Americans against their nation and to believe that no borders, no wall, no USA at all, that America inherently sucks, but everybody wants to get into it.
[02:11:08.106 --> 02:11:09.307]  Now, I'm not tooting our horn here.
[02:11:09.327 --> 02:11:10.687]  I want you to know the power of the people.
[02:11:10.727 --> 02:11:19.212]  Trump came out two days ago, created a new office in the White House for you to send reports, screenshots, on how you've been censored by big tech.
[02:11:21.313 --> 02:11:22.854]  The president asked for information.
[02:11:24.136 --> 02:11:30.542]  And I remember talking to Mike Adams last year, a few months before the election, and I said, Mike, you're a smart guy.
[02:11:30.642 --> 02:11:34.245]  Write some reports about tech censorship and what you think the President should do.
[02:11:34.305 --> 02:11:36.607]  And Mike did write those reports, and we did get them to the White House.
[02:11:37.868 --> 02:11:41.110]  And you see examples of this, because the President's smart, he's a real estate mogul, all that.
[02:11:41.491 --> 02:11:45.914]  He doesn't know about invoking the Insurrection Act.
[02:11:45.954 --> 02:11:47.135]  He doesn't know about things like that.
[02:11:47.938 --> 02:11:50.801]  And so first he didn't declare the full emergency, now he's set to do it.
[02:11:51.422 --> 02:11:56.848]  And Mike goes through a laundry list, a wish list, in this new article on InfoWars.com and NaturalNews.com.
[02:11:57.671 --> 02:11:57.831]  I think?
[02:12:22.887 --> 02:12:25.028]  Trump's starting to cut off the funding to Central America.
[02:12:25.048 --> 02:12:26.489]  He needs to cut off U.N.
[02:12:26.529 --> 02:12:26.849]  funding.
[02:12:26.889 --> 02:12:28.330]  He needs to go after Soros.
[02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:34.654]  You lay all this out, really, and just to cut and dry how far gone we are, Mike Adams.
[02:12:34.974 --> 02:12:36.635]  So, lay it out, and thanks for joining us.
[02:12:37.455 --> 02:12:38.216]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:12:38.256 --> 02:12:38.976]  I want to be clear.
[02:12:39.056 --> 02:12:41.818]  I don't have any contact with the Trump administration.
[02:12:41.858 --> 02:12:43.058]  This is my own analysis.
[02:12:43.118 --> 02:12:45.680]  Trump may or may not go this far.
[02:12:45.700 --> 02:12:49.242]  No, I know, but you remember us having the conversations, and I said we were getting to the President.
[02:12:50.471 --> 02:12:51.771]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:12:52.132 --> 02:12:56.673]  But people who are worried about Trump becoming an authoritarian need to have a reality check.
[02:12:56.713 --> 02:13:04.355]  It's the authoritarianism of the left that is crushing the First Amendment, crushing our fair and free elections, and overrunning our country.
[02:13:04.415 --> 02:13:07.816]  And Trump is finally standing up and saying, you know what?
[02:13:08.136 --> 02:13:09.257]  I'm going to fight for America.
[02:13:09.637 --> 02:13:11.157]  And we, the people, need to support him.
[02:13:11.517 --> 02:13:17.399]  And if Trump needs to invoke the Insurrection Act and invoke the executive orders that Obama left behind,
[02:13:17.939 --> 02:13:24.244]  You know, Trump needs to use the powers that we the people granted him because we elected Trump to defend America.
[02:13:24.604 --> 02:13:29.988]  Remember Alex, Trump ran on build the wall, drain the swamp, lock her up.
[02:13:30.108 --> 02:13:35.411]  Trump ran on the platform of indicting the treasonous criminals inside America.
[02:13:35.712 --> 02:13:45.018]  So Trump is simply fulfilling his promises to the voters and the voters knew that Trump was going to do this when we elected him and we want him to do it and we support him doing it.
[02:13:45.258 --> 02:13:46.259]  So that's where we are today.
[02:13:46.519 --> 02:13:47.760]  It's time to defend America.
[02:13:47.980 --> 02:13:49.121]  We have the right to self-defense.
[02:13:49.461 --> 02:13:53.483]  If the Democrats ever seize power again, they will gut this country.
[02:13:53.884 --> 02:13:55.485]  They will destroy the Second Amendment.
[02:13:55.505 --> 02:13:57.126]  They've already crushed the First Amendment.
[02:13:57.506 --> 02:14:00.248]  They will go door-to-door with gun confiscations.
[02:14:00.528 --> 02:14:13.296]  And I think the radicalism of the left would actually lead this country to a point where leftists are executing Christians door-to-door, criminalizing scripture, criminalizing the Bible, and literally hunting down and killing people.
[02:14:13.916 --> 02:14:18.279]  Facts of news where they're openly saying it in mainline sites, kill all Christians now.
[02:14:18.780 --> 02:14:20.341]  This is their modus operandi.
[02:14:21.182 --> 02:14:22.203]  We're not the radicals.
[02:14:22.623 --> 02:14:23.824]  They've gotten to this point.
[02:14:24.972 --> 02:14:33.918]  It's time for America to fight for its survival, and it's become clear that the radical left, which is lawless, cannot coexist in a fair and free society.
[02:14:34.258 --> 02:14:40.662]  They do not honor elections unless they cheat and win them through ballot harvesting, for example.
[02:14:40.962 --> 02:14:43.984]  They do not honor the presidency that Trump has.
[02:14:44.044 --> 02:14:45.405]  They've tried to overthrow it.
[02:14:45.685 --> 02:14:47.086]  They've engaged in treason.
[02:14:47.466 --> 02:14:52.289]  We are in a state of war that Trump is now fully recognizing.
[02:14:52.589 --> 02:14:54.693]  And we the people need to support Trump.
[02:14:54.813 --> 02:14:56.175]  I have to emphasize this.
[02:14:56.556 --> 02:15:02.185]  We do not encourage anybody to initiate any kind of vigilante action or anything of that kind.
[02:15:02.545 --> 02:15:05.070]  We want we the people to support Trump's
[02:15:05.998 --> 02:15:11.341]  We have the proper authority to go after the enemies of America who are operating within America.
[02:15:11.761 --> 02:15:23.908]  And in fact, I hope, I don't know if Trump is even thinking about this, but I hope that Trump would use the Insurrection Act to arrest the governor of California for aiding and abetting illegal aliens.
[02:15:24.268 --> 02:15:31.172]  And I hope, by the way, you might want to talk to Stuart Rhodes about this because... We will arrest a lawyer and also arrest the mayor of Oakland.
[02:15:32.282 --> 02:15:34.103]  It's all going to happen or we're going to be destroyed.
[02:15:34.423 --> 02:15:36.325]  Because they're the radicals, they're making the move.
[02:15:36.665 --> 02:15:37.646]  This all sounds radical.
[02:15:37.706 --> 02:15:39.647]  No, this is the response to their treason.
[02:15:39.667 --> 02:15:41.688]  So let's briefly talk about your article.
[02:15:41.768 --> 02:15:48.012]  What you lay out at naturalnews.com, the articles on newswars.com, infowars.com.
[02:15:48.493 --> 02:15:50.074]  Share the article now.
[02:15:50.714 --> 02:15:59.800]  It is so critical that we really put on the table how serious the situation is with the UN and its collaborators trying to break our government right now.
[02:16:07.897 --> 02:16:10.998]  Everything you say we are is what you are.
[02:16:11.538 --> 02:16:12.418]  I'm a libertarian.
[02:16:12.519 --> 02:16:13.559]  I believe in real freedom.
[02:16:13.899 --> 02:16:15.499]  I believe in egalitarianism.
[02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:16.800]  I believe in the West.
[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:17.960]  I'm a liberal.
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:18.740]  You're not.
[02:16:19.021 --> 02:16:26.803]  You're leftist, left-hand path, power-mongering, power cult of control freaks that are dangerous, that are classical authoritarians.
[02:16:26.943 --> 02:16:30.686]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous, is what Facebook is saying.
[02:16:30.967 --> 02:16:45.260]  Those individuals include Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has a history of anti-Semitic remarks, people like right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and then also some right-wing media personalities who are pretty popular online, people like Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer,
[02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:47.540]  Paul Joseph Watson, those people are banned.
[02:16:47.701 --> 02:17:03.544]  Facebook obviously owns Instagram, and so someone like Alex Jones, who had been banned from Facebook a while back last year in the summer, but he was still having a presence on Instagram, and that had drawn a lot of scrutiny from people who were saying, hey, you know, you guys banned him from one of your platforms, why are you allowing him to have a presence on Instagram?
[02:17:03.884 --> 02:17:11.966]  And so, yes, now Facebook is going to be banning Alex Jones and InfoWars from not only their main platform, Facebook, but also from Instagram.
[02:17:12.446 --> 02:17:14.987]  I checked in also to see if these people would be banned from WhatsApp.
[02:17:15.327 --> 02:17:24.771]  Which is also owned by Facebook, and a spokesperson cannot say immediately because it's, I guess, unclear whether some of these people have WhatsApp accounts, according to the spokesperson.
[02:17:25.191 --> 02:17:31.693]  Oliver Darcy, the literal rat-like creature that slithers around policing and harassing conservative sponsors.
[02:17:31.933 --> 02:17:32.954]  So now this rat
[02:17:33.294 --> 02:17:36.437]  He's the person running the story that Drudge is linked to.
[02:17:36.577 --> 02:17:41.282]  Facebook bans Louis Farrakhan, Milo Yiannopoulos, InfoWars, and others for its platforms.
[02:17:41.302 --> 02:17:41.942]  And notice how they did it.
[02:17:42.023 --> 02:17:43.924]  Milo Yiannopoulos is a gay Jewish person.
[02:17:44.165 --> 02:17:47.408]  You've got Louis Farrakhan with his own issues and then InfoWars.
[02:17:47.448 --> 02:17:55.035]  But they mix it and they say anti-Semitism and hate and dangerousness, not fake news, not dangerousness, will be purged.
[02:17:55.956 --> 02:17:56.857]  From the platform.
[02:17:56.877 --> 02:17:59.278]  So they say, Alex Jones will be purged.
[02:17:59.559 --> 02:17:59.919]  Purged!
[02:18:00.019 --> 02:18:01.020]  I'm being purged!
[02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:03.621]  If you study authoritarian regimes, that's what they do.
[02:18:03.661 --> 02:18:12.307]  They make the public start decrying one person first, then it's another person, then it's a group, then it's everybody, then it's their own family, their own parents, their own children.
[02:18:12.487 --> 02:18:13.288]  This is 1984.
[02:18:13.528 --> 02:18:17.611]  Now, I've been on the air 24 and a half years.
[02:18:17.871 --> 02:18:23.775]  And I'm about to lay out for you, ladies and gentlemen, information that is hands down
[02:18:24.798 --> 02:18:29.220]  The most important information I've ever covered.
[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:31.321]  Now I want to explain to everybody listening, please.
[02:18:31.581 --> 02:18:32.841]  This is not about Alex Jones.
[02:18:32.981 --> 02:18:34.322]  This is not about Louis Farrakhan.
[02:18:34.342 --> 02:18:35.903]  This is not about Milo Yiannopoulos.
[02:18:35.923 --> 02:18:37.063]  This is not about Laura Loomer.
[02:18:37.223 --> 02:18:41.425]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[02:18:41.685 --> 02:18:55.972]  It is being announced in the name of defeating me and you, the populist, that number one, they admit AI is now censoring in live time with machine learning, working with 20,000 SJW Southern Poverty Law Center trained individuals.
[02:18:55.992 --> 02:18:56.632]  This is all public.
[02:18:56.672 --> 02:19:02.955]  They're saying if you say my name or info wars in even just a neutral light, it's an official press release, you will be banned.
[02:19:03.035 --> 02:19:04.976]  The outrageousness of that is next level.
[02:19:04.996 --> 02:19:06.317]  That's like a movie, like, where the
[02:19:06.517 --> 02:19:08.879]  You know, the evil guy takes away somebody.
[02:19:09.019 --> 02:19:11.621]  If you ever say his name again, you'll go to the gulag.
[02:19:11.741 --> 02:19:12.801]  Good Lord!
[02:19:12.981 --> 02:19:14.883]  This is unbelievable.
[02:19:15.163 --> 02:19:17.424]  All premeditated political setup.
[02:19:17.444 --> 02:19:18.805]  You say, well, why is it happening?
[02:19:19.146 --> 02:19:20.146]  Why won't Trump stop it?
[02:19:20.166 --> 02:19:21.167]  Because it's all the banks.
[02:19:21.407 --> 02:19:22.328]  It's all the corporations.
[02:19:22.708 --> 02:19:24.029]  The NSA runs it all.
[02:19:24.109 --> 02:19:25.770]  It's the architecture of the future.
[02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:29.332]  The big digital brain we all interface with and upload to.
[02:19:30.033 --> 02:19:32.254]  Darp admits that's the plan, so that's what they built.
[02:19:32.554 --> 02:19:33.375]  That's what it is.
[02:19:33.655 --> 02:19:34.836]  It's always going to be that way.
[02:19:34.956 --> 02:19:36.177]  It was never not going to be that way.
[02:19:36.377 --> 02:19:38.738]  And now, I am patient zero.
[02:19:38.958 --> 02:19:41.360]  I'm actually honored to have the Antichrist system ban me first.
[02:20:06.221 --> 02:20:08.808]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:31.075 --> 02:20:32.236]  Folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:20:33.177 --> 02:20:34.178]  Mike's leaving us in a few minutes.
[02:20:34.198 --> 02:20:35.899]  We're going to go right back to your calls, Debbie, and others.
[02:20:37.461 --> 02:20:44.006]  But the President has signaled, and the articles are up on Infowars.com, Daily Caller, you name it, U.S.
[02:20:44.046 --> 02:20:51.493]  Code Title 10, Chapter 252, Use of Militia Armed Forces to Enforce Federal Authority.
[02:20:53.214 --> 02:20:55.917]  Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions
[02:20:57.145 --> 02:21:11.176]  Combinations or assemblages or rebellion against the authority of the United States makes it impractical to enforce the laws of the United States in any state of the ordinary course of judicial proceedings.
[02:21:11.997 --> 02:21:22.245]  He may call into federal service such as the militia or any state and use such the armed forces as he considers necessary to enforce those laws or to suppress.
[02:21:23.410 --> 02:21:23.910]  The rebellion.
[02:21:24.831 --> 02:21:27.672]  You have all these Republicans that go along with it.
[02:21:27.692 --> 02:21:29.754]  You have all these Democrats saying overthrow the government.
[02:21:30.894 --> 02:21:34.136]  You have the governor of California saying we're totally open.
[02:21:34.176 --> 02:21:34.496]  Come here.
[02:21:34.516 --> 02:21:35.177]  Everything's free.
[02:21:35.197 --> 02:21:37.338]  Illegal aliens deserve everything free.
[02:21:38.979 --> 02:21:40.680]  You have AOC saying that.
[02:21:40.700 --> 02:21:46.583]  You have all these mayors saying we're not going to let you even arrest convicted child molesters to deport them.
[02:21:46.963 --> 02:21:48.384]  We're going to warn MS-13.
[02:21:49.404 --> 02:21:52.086]  That is open insurrection and rebellion.
[02:21:53.533 --> 02:21:58.457]  And, you know, you see some old farmer won't give their land up to the bank, you know, they send the feds in to kill them, or whatever.
[02:21:58.497 --> 02:22:03.661]  But this is actual, out-of-control, multinationals funding U.N.
[02:22:03.701 --> 02:22:07.263]  invasions and working with Democrat governors and others.
[02:22:07.403 --> 02:22:11.506]  And as I've said, the real action is to arrest their ass.
[02:22:12.227 --> 02:22:13.268]  Anybody else did that?
[02:22:14.284 --> 02:22:14.965]  You'd get arrested.
[02:22:15.005 --> 02:22:15.826]  It's a federal crime.
[02:22:16.287 --> 02:22:18.390]  But we have armed invasions happening.
[02:22:19.151 --> 02:22:20.032]  We're supposed to put up with it.
[02:22:20.092 --> 02:22:23.477]  This is Democrat-run, All God's Children, MS-13.
[02:22:23.517 --> 02:22:28.404]  So, you call for a lot of things under the power of this civil emergency.
[02:22:28.424 --> 02:22:29.205]  Get into some of those, Mike.
[02:22:30.489 --> 02:22:34.852]  Well, for one thing, the courts are now conspiring against the United States of America.
[02:22:34.932 --> 02:22:37.674]  The courts, the liberal courts, have become lawless.
[02:22:37.714 --> 02:22:48.221]  And in fact, the Insurrection Act is the number one method for the executive commander-in-chief to bypass corrupt courts and even potentially seek the arrest of... Well, what's his name?
[02:22:48.301 --> 02:22:51.503]  Abraham Lincoln arrested federal judges and newspaper editors under this.
[02:22:52.461 --> 02:22:53.382]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:22:53.402 --> 02:22:57.268]  And remember that Congress has granted this power to the Office of the Presidency.
[02:22:57.348 --> 02:22:58.470]  Congress did so in 1807.
[02:22:58.850 --> 02:23:00.773]  So this isn't anything new.
[02:23:01.153 --> 02:23:04.498]  In fact, this act has been used before, for example, during the L.A.
[02:23:04.578 --> 02:23:04.939]  riots.
[02:23:05.519 --> 02:23:07.682]  And, you know, it will be used again.
[02:23:08.641 --> 02:23:15.363]  To anybody saying that, well, Trump shouldn't use the power that the voters gave him to defend America, I say nonsense!
[02:23:16.223 --> 02:23:27.605]  Think about, if you concealed carry a handgun in order to defend yourself against a violent attacker, are you going to be attacked one day by someone who's trying to bash your skull in with a spiked baseball bat?
[02:23:27.645 --> 02:23:29.066]  Yeah, when they engage in anarchy...
[02:23:30.086 --> 02:23:32.629]  When they engage in anarchy, you engage in martial law.
[02:23:32.649 --> 02:23:34.932]  I mean, you're outside the court to defend yourself.
[02:23:34.972 --> 02:23:36.153]  The system's breaking down.
[02:23:36.634 --> 02:23:37.575]  It's falling apart.
[02:23:38.076 --> 02:23:38.937]  What else are we going to do?
[02:23:39.057 --> 02:23:44.103]  Imagine, though, if we let this keep going, how insane it's going to be with the tens of millions pouring in a year.
[02:23:45.089 --> 02:23:48.333]  And here's why I think California may be the front lines of what's happening here.
[02:23:48.373 --> 02:24:00.386]  I think Governor Newsom may order the California National Guard to disobey Trump's orders, and then Trump may assert federal authority over those troops, and we may have a conflict there.
[02:24:00.766 --> 02:24:12.572]  Trump could order other National Guard divisions to arrest the treasonous leaders of the California National Guard organizations if they don't follow federal law and follow the orders of the President.
[02:24:12.612 --> 02:24:15.794]  So I can see a state versus federal conflict there.
[02:24:16.074 --> 02:24:16.514]  No, you're right.
[02:24:19.055 --> 02:24:24.698]  Camilla Harris has come out and said that she will use a national emergency of President to confiscate the guns.
[02:24:24.938 --> 02:24:26.199]  So that's the road we're going down here.
[02:24:27.062 --> 02:24:32.587]  Yes, and recognize, if a Democrat ever gets into power again in the White House, it's over for America.
[02:24:32.867 --> 02:24:36.130]  Because they will seize all guns at gunpoint all across America.
[02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:41.295]  They say they want a one-party state, they want a civil war, only an insane person.
[02:24:41.655 --> 02:24:42.096]  I agree.
[02:24:42.276 --> 02:24:44.518]  The Democratic Party has to be basically disbanded.
[02:24:45.646 --> 02:24:48.667]  Well, look, they are on their own suicide mission.
[02:24:48.707 --> 02:24:52.968]  They practically sacrificed everything to try to take out Trump with this Russia collusion hoax.
[02:24:53.268 --> 02:24:57.189]  Their deep state operatives are about to be indicted through the Department of Justice.
[02:24:57.569 --> 02:24:59.869]  Trump must simply be very careful here, right?
[02:25:00.430 --> 02:25:04.331]  The left is going to declare him to be acting like a dictator.
[02:25:04.511 --> 02:25:06.891]  They've already done that, no matter what he does.
[02:25:07.231 --> 02:25:10.292]  But Trump must use the powers that have been granted to him
[02:25:10.872 --> 02:25:20.577]  And by the way, Mike, I a trillion percent agree with you, and I want to explain to everybody something.
[02:25:21.178 --> 02:25:27.281]  I've never had it on my heart, this sick feeling of how sad this is, but we're in a defensive mode here.
[02:25:27.961 --> 02:25:31.122]  And the president, by the way, I think's waited too long already.
[02:25:31.562 --> 02:25:35.764]  This is a classical authoritarian takeover by multinational forces.
[02:25:36.124 --> 02:25:38.525]  As you point out, California is run by China.
[02:25:38.885 --> 02:25:41.006]  You're married to a lady from Taiwan.
[02:25:41.246 --> 02:25:42.367]  You have businesses in China.
[02:25:42.607 --> 02:25:43.447]  You speak Chinese.
[02:25:43.787 --> 02:25:44.467]  This is a fact.
[02:25:44.547 --> 02:25:46.928]  China says on air, they're at war with us.
[02:25:47.208 --> 02:25:48.649]  They brag they own our media.
[02:25:48.869 --> 02:25:49.849]  They say we're weak.
[02:25:50.109 --> 02:25:51.310]  This is a big joke in China.
[02:25:52.335 --> 02:25:55.496]  You know, actually, my wife's family escaped the Communist Chinese.
[02:25:55.916 --> 02:25:59.116]  They escaped to Taiwan from the Cultural Revolution of China.
[02:25:59.556 --> 02:26:05.677]  So, I know all about what Communism does to people and the hardship that people go through to escape that.
[02:26:05.977 --> 02:26:07.098]  Again, I speak Chinese.
[02:26:07.458 --> 02:26:09.218]  I lived in Taiwan for two years.
[02:26:09.258 --> 02:26:10.318]  I've toured throughout China.
[02:26:10.618 --> 02:26:13.199]  I know exactly what's going on and how this plays out.
[02:26:13.439 --> 02:26:21.000]  And I know that the left in America is planning an armed Cultural Revolution where they will go door-to-door and execute Trump supporters and Christians.
[02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:24.442]  Admit this, this is mainline taught everywhere.
[02:26:25.042 --> 02:26:27.624]  That's why the operating system of Antifa is maliced.
[02:26:28.905 --> 02:26:33.607]  Well, and as Stuart Rhodes has said, the terror cells have already been brought into the United States.
[02:26:33.627 --> 02:26:39.911]  They're planning to be activated to carry out a Tet offensive type of attack against America, against Trump.
[02:26:39.931 --> 02:26:41.232]  They will try to assassinate him.
[02:26:41.512 --> 02:26:43.033]  They will try to take down all patriots.
[02:26:43.373 --> 02:26:50.738]  This is why the people of California purchased over a million standard capacity gun magazines during that one week when it was legal to do so.
[02:26:51.098 --> 02:26:56.300]  They bought those magazines and they have buried them, they've hidden them, and they are ready to defend this nation.
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:27:00.963]  Not to initiate violence, but to defend our nation and those who seek to destroy it.
[02:27:01.163 --> 02:27:06.705]  People wonder why the Soviet Union invaded places, they wonder why Hitler did what he did, they get on megalomaniacal power trips.
[02:27:06.865 --> 02:27:07.926]  They're all, as you said...
[02:27:08.726 --> 02:27:13.890]  The Democrats, the globalists, their operatives, they're saying they're going to have a race war.
[02:27:14.050 --> 02:27:15.852]  It's not the minorities doing it, it's the controllers.
[02:27:16.232 --> 02:27:17.793]  They're saying they're going to take the guns.
[02:27:18.154 --> 02:27:19.735]  They're saying they're going to have a civil war.
[02:27:20.055 --> 02:27:21.636]  They're saying they're going to kill everybody.
[02:27:22.057 --> 02:27:26.620]  And so, I mean, I'm sorry, we have to act against them.
[02:27:27.481 --> 02:27:29.063]  And there's no other way to do it.
[02:27:29.083 --> 02:27:38.712]  I'm talking about the government, Trump, the patriots we have in intelligence agencies, but all of us eyes and ears on the ground have to give maximum support to really cutting this cancer out.
[02:27:38.752 --> 02:27:39.473]  It's got to be done now.
[02:27:40.830 --> 02:28:02.578]  And I know you need to go to callers, so I'll go here, but understand that the journo-terrorism organizations, the fake news media, are intentionally trying to whip up mass hysteria, mass mental illness among the left, so that those people don't have any rationality, they don't recognize anything resembling the rule of law, and they are unable to coexist in a civil society.
[02:28:02.938 --> 02:28:03.919]  And that's where we are today.
[02:28:03.959 --> 02:28:05.880]  The media has created this on purpose.
[02:28:06.140 --> 02:28:09.581]  They want mass chaos, they want America overrun, they want America defeated.
[02:28:10.021 --> 02:28:13.443]  We, the people, have had enough with our Commander-in-Chief, who we support.
[02:28:13.643 --> 02:28:15.084]  We're going to defend this nation, Alex.
[02:28:15.965 --> 02:28:17.265]  And again, it's all admitted.
[02:28:17.425 --> 02:28:19.326]  The plan, the UN, the invasion.
[02:28:19.847 --> 02:28:21.047]  Yes, it's happening, folks.
[02:28:21.067 --> 02:28:21.848]  This is not a joke.
[02:28:22.328 --> 02:28:22.708]  It's here.
[02:28:22.788 --> 02:28:24.569]  Thank God other nationals are getting elected.
[02:28:24.589 --> 02:28:26.431]  It's an incredible time.
[02:28:26.471 --> 02:28:29.853]  Read the article at InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and NaturalNews.com.
[02:28:30.113 --> 02:28:30.913]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:28:31.093 --> 02:28:32.194]  This is an incredible time.
[02:28:32.514 --> 02:28:33.875]  Thank you, Mike Adams, for joining us.
[02:28:34.821 --> 02:28:35.261]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:28:35.501 --> 02:28:37.482]  When we come back, we're going right to your phone calls.
[02:28:37.522 --> 02:28:38.382]  Here's Antifa.
[02:28:38.642 --> 02:28:41.123]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[02:28:41.163 --> 02:28:53.588]  This is a mainline Democrat.
[02:28:55.049 --> 02:28:57.690]  They are arrogant terrorists preparing to make their move.
[02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:58.610]  What are we going to do?
[02:28:59.211 --> 02:28:59.991]  What are you going to do?
[02:29:00.011 --> 02:29:00.791]  They're coming for you.
[02:29:12.612 --> 02:29:18.373]  Fight back against your sluggish day by getting TurboForce right now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:29:19.834 --> 02:29:23.054]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[02:29:23.514 --> 02:29:29.556]  While coffee, candy and other sugary products can give you that short-term boost, they also give you the crash.
[02:29:30.136 --> 02:29:35.897]  TurboForce from InfoWarsLife gives you focus, clarity and the energy you need on the go.
[02:29:36.297 --> 02:29:40.340]  You get 14 servings per box for a massive two-week supply.

[02:30:04.076 --> 02:30:05.437]  I want to say brain force is great.
[02:30:05.517 --> 02:30:07.298]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[02:30:07.418 --> 02:30:07.818]  It is.
[02:30:08.018 --> 02:30:12.420]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[02:30:12.900 --> 02:30:14.161]  The fish oil is better than it.
[02:30:14.241 --> 02:30:16.002]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:30:16.062 --> 02:30:18.383]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[02:30:18.543 --> 02:30:20.104]  Brain, body, heart.
[02:30:20.184 --> 02:30:21.564]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[02:30:21.644 --> 02:30:22.865]  You've got the children's.
[02:30:23.005 --> 02:30:23.946]  You've got the adults.
[02:30:24.126 --> 02:30:25.026]  You've got the krill oil.
[02:30:25.126 --> 02:30:28.488]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[02:30:28.508 --> 02:30:30.869]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[02:30:31.249 --> 02:30:33.110]  It'll give you the damn burps, and I'm just sorry.
[02:30:33.310 --> 02:30:34.190]  You want something like this?
[02:30:34.290 --> 02:30:35.151]  You don't get stuff for free.
[02:30:35.251 --> 02:30:37.131]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[02:30:37.191 --> 02:30:38.312]  It's so good, in my view.
[02:30:38.392 --> 02:30:40.393]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[02:30:40.433 --> 02:30:45.054]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:30:46.835 --> 02:30:51.377]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:30:54.349 --> 02:31:00.153]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:31:00.373 --> 02:31:01.094]  I just can't do it!
[02:31:03.001 --> 02:31:08.985]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[02:31:09.365 --> 02:31:11.987]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[02:31:12.587 --> 02:31:16.009]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:31:16.290 --> 02:31:20.552]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:31:20.993 --> 02:31:24.235]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:31:25.155 --> 02:31:35.382]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:31:36.142 --> 02:31:44.688]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[02:31:46.309 --> 02:31:54.854]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.
[02:31:55.355 --> 02:31:59.637]  Try Bodies today at InfoWarsLife.com or call us at 1-888-253-3139.
[02:32:02.967 --> 02:32:08.871]  In a time where your body is constantly under attack by outside toxins, irregularity can be a nightmare.
[02:32:09.091 --> 02:32:15.275]  That's why InfoWars Life created Regulize Complete to relieve intestinal issues in a gentle way.
[02:32:15.595 --> 02:32:18.077]  Often a result of poor diet and lifestyle habits.
[02:32:18.297 --> 02:32:21.701]  An occasionally constipated colon can cause massive problems.
[02:32:22.022 --> 02:32:28.230]  Our researchers combined ancient ingredients traditionally used to combat these issues in an affordable way.
[02:32:28.510 --> 02:32:34.558]  Other harsh, stimulant laxatives can create massive discomfort in trying to solve intestinal issues.
[02:32:35.058 --> 02:32:42.064]  But Regulize Complete was made to be taken in a daily overnight colon cleanse to help you reach optimal gut and colon health.
[02:32:42.304 --> 02:32:49.210]  Our gentle, natural laxative, unlike other laxative products, our low dose is safe enough for year-round consumption.
[02:32:49.371 --> 02:32:53.754]  Don't let intestinal distress and occasional constipation get the jump on you.
[02:32:54.255 --> 02:33:01.681]  Start your colon cleansing for a healthier, happier gut today with Regulize Complete, available at infowarestore.com.
[02:33:05.703 --> 02:33:08.326]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:35.287 --> 02:33:35.908]  We're good.
[02:34:02.034 --> 02:34:06.378]  Sweet Lucy was a dancer, but none of us could have her.
[02:34:06.398 --> 02:34:15.707]  Sweet Lucy was a dancer, but none of us could chance her, because she was a samurai.
[02:34:20.436 --> 02:34:27.861]  All right, I'm going to take your calls these next two segments, and then I'm going to just take two segments of baggage, which is coming up the fourth hour as a guest host.
[02:34:27.901 --> 02:34:28.582]  That's a great job.
[02:34:29.502 --> 02:34:33.325]  Because I want listeners to know what we're up to and what we're doing.
[02:34:34.366 --> 02:34:38.088]  And I want you to know where your money's going when you support the First Amendment and support us.
[02:34:39.389 --> 02:34:47.695]  I told folks, with all those Hillary Clinton, WilmerHale finance lawsuits, that's her law firm, that I'm not settling any of these cases.
[02:34:49.266 --> 02:34:49.846]  I told them that.
[02:34:49.926 --> 02:34:54.909]  Word is they've spent over a million and a half dollars suing me over Pepe the Frog.
[02:34:55.529 --> 02:34:56.190]  We've spent about $100,000.
[02:34:56.230 --> 02:35:02.873]  And we just won huge court victories yesterday.
[02:35:04.074 --> 02:35:08.096]  Now the media tries to spin these and just say it's going to a jury trial.
[02:35:08.936 --> 02:35:13.599]  They already tried to settle for nothing but have me say I'm guilty of something I didn't do.
[02:35:15.686 --> 02:35:19.791]  So, we're going to trial, and I'm getting up there in front of that jury.
[02:35:20.972 --> 02:35:27.018]  Because we've got the man that supposedly made the frog, telling everybody to use it, it's free to air, there's no copyright.
[02:35:29.461 --> 02:35:34.306]  And then we sold somebody else's poster that had a little bitty image of a red frog on it, with a bunch of other symbols.
[02:35:34.386 --> 02:35:35.047]  That's fair use.
[02:35:35.508 --> 02:35:36.669]  Hell, that's not even fair use, that's just art!
[02:35:40.703 --> 02:35:43.485]  Judge ruled yesterday the maximum they can get is $13,000.
[02:35:43.585 --> 02:35:47.067]  That's the order to the jury.
[02:35:48.848 --> 02:35:54.432]  So Hillary Clinton and Wilmer Hale have spent over a million dollars trying to annihilate the First Amendment.
[02:35:55.693 --> 02:36:03.918]  And when they get us to the jury trial, even if we lose $13,000, that's called a Pyrrhic victory.
[02:36:04.859 --> 02:36:06.740]  You win the war, but you lose it.
[02:36:10.034 --> 02:36:16.595]  So as John Paul Jones once said, the British ship three times the size of his said, would you like to surrender?
[02:36:16.615 --> 02:36:19.716]  Because he had a fire on his deck when he was attacking them.
[02:36:20.496 --> 02:36:21.856]  And he said, I've only begun to fight.
[02:36:23.317 --> 02:36:33.699]  We've gotten 18 of 23 lawsuits thrown out in the last two years, and you never see it in the news.
[02:36:36.288 --> 02:36:40.891]  When they win some little procedural thing, which is normal and stuff, they'll call it a big victory.
[02:36:42.272 --> 02:36:43.413]  And then they'll move on from that.
[02:36:45.234 --> 02:36:46.515]  And it's been one hell of a fight.
[02:36:47.556 --> 02:36:48.817]  And it's cost millions of dollars.
[02:36:50.238 --> 02:36:53.960]  But the good news is, about the left, is they're such inherent liars.
[02:36:58.123 --> 02:37:01.586]  They just, when they put these filings in, they're just so full of crap!
[02:37:04.124 --> 02:37:06.627]  That when it gets down to brass tacks, that's the end of them.
[02:37:11.772 --> 02:37:18.339]  Now, I don't have the money, but we've got some sure cases against some people I'd like to sue to teach them a lesson.
[02:37:21.462 --> 02:37:26.507]  If some rich endowment comes along and would like to support the First Amendment and fund us, we're going to sue the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:37:27.679 --> 02:37:34.563]  Facebook, Media Matters, and fake whistleblowers that lie about things I never did.
[02:37:34.583 --> 02:37:36.584]  In fact, I'm going to sue some of them regardless.
[02:37:37.445 --> 02:37:39.366]  Just because at a certain point I've got to fight back.
[02:37:40.167 --> 02:37:45.170]  People tell these whole cloth lies for money about me, and they'll do it to you too.
[02:37:46.811 --> 02:37:55.376]  But I'm just telling you this, I'm committed to fighting, and I said I'd get to the whole Pepe thing, and I'm already doing it right now.
[02:37:56.980 --> 02:37:57.981]  It's getting crazy, man.
[02:37:58.702 --> 02:38:02.365]  You turn the news on, Alex Jones taking off YouTube for beating up a 10-year-old boy.
[02:38:03.706 --> 02:38:09.011]  And the phone's ringing, and I got like a cousin calling at 6 a.m., and I go look, and it's like, that's not me.
[02:38:09.111 --> 02:38:10.352]  I've never been arrested.
[02:38:10.412 --> 02:38:11.934]  I never beat up any kid.
[02:38:12.714 --> 02:38:17.839]  It's some ABC video out of Missouri of a guy that barely even looks like me.
[02:38:20.461 --> 02:38:21.702]  And they said I beat a kid up.
[02:38:21.762 --> 02:38:23.204]  I mean, you know, I mean, I got a...
[02:38:25.043 --> 02:38:25.783]  Sue somebody?
[02:38:34.405 --> 02:38:35.105]  It's out of control.
[02:38:38.066 --> 02:38:39.286]  It's totally out of control.
[02:38:40.186 --> 02:38:41.166]  I had family calling up.
[02:38:41.246 --> 02:38:44.107]  They said, you're off YouTube for beating a child up?
[02:38:44.507 --> 02:38:45.487]  And I'm like, excuse me?
[02:38:45.727 --> 02:38:45.927]  What?
[02:38:46.487 --> 02:38:47.287]  Let me go to a computer.
[02:38:47.307 --> 02:38:48.388]  I'm sitting there looking at the computer.
[02:38:48.408 --> 02:38:49.828]  I'm like, what the hell is this?
[02:38:51.957 --> 02:38:53.358]  I said I'd go to your calls, and I apologize.
[02:38:53.378 --> 02:38:54.198]  I'm going to Debbie right now.
[02:38:54.218 --> 02:39:02.363]  It's just that for some reason this morning I was on the computer, and I was on YouTube watching a Paul Watson video, and I saw a John Ronson video.
[02:39:04.464 --> 02:39:05.264]  And so I hit play.
[02:39:05.284 --> 02:39:07.666]  It just had my name in it.
[02:39:09.106 --> 02:39:10.827]  And man, he was telling lies.
[02:39:10.927 --> 02:39:12.708]  Just, it was all lies.
[02:39:14.689 --> 02:39:19.632]  And I remember when I agreed to do an interview with the guy, he said, oh, it was about your cool childhood in Wild Wild West.
[02:39:20.713 --> 02:39:21.473]  And I agreed to do the interview.
[02:39:24.807 --> 02:39:33.251]  And when I was doing the interview, he said, yeah, you got tied up by a bunch of kids you bullied, and they knocked all your teeth out.
[02:39:34.672 --> 02:39:35.712]  I was like, that never happened.
[02:39:36.353 --> 02:39:37.733]  He goes, I'm sorry, Alex.
[02:39:37.773 --> 02:39:39.574]  They knocked all your front teeth out.
[02:39:41.355 --> 02:39:42.556]  And I said, you're joking, right?
[02:39:42.596 --> 02:39:44.196]  I said, I'll go to a dentist.
[02:39:44.216 --> 02:39:45.017]  They can do a scan.
[02:39:45.037 --> 02:39:47.178]  A dentist can tell you I've never had any teeth knocked out.
[02:39:50.137 --> 02:39:51.218]  He goes, oh, we want that.
[02:39:51.238 --> 02:39:54.919]  Then of course they backed out of it because the guy is a fiction writer.
[02:39:55.420 --> 02:40:00.102]  And of course, almost all the YouTube comments are like, look at this slimy psychopath.
[02:40:00.962 --> 02:40:13.528]  Cause he talks about his morals and he talks to the video all about his ethics with him and some other loser that no one would watch unless they were talking about us about how I'm this bad guy and they're these good guys.
[02:40:14.789 --> 02:40:16.970]  No, no, John, you're a, you're a fraud.
[02:40:19.281 --> 02:40:25.322]  And I don't know why I would carry a scorpion on my back like the frog does, because I already knew you were a liar.
[02:40:26.923 --> 02:40:30.423]  And he even talks about how they trick people to do interviews with him in the deal.
[02:40:30.723 --> 02:40:43.306]  And it's just like, why are we plagued by these fake, nightmare-like sociopaths and psychopaths that sit there and pose like there's these good people, because they know what they're tasked with.
[02:40:46.192 --> 02:40:55.960]  Their task is to create fake legends about Americana, about men, about families, about anything good.
[02:40:56.080 --> 02:40:56.620]  That's their job.
[02:40:58.242 --> 02:40:58.762]  That's their job.
[02:41:00.203 --> 02:41:00.604]  Yes.
[02:41:02.966 --> 02:41:06.849]  And it doesn't even hurt me that they tell these lies, but my wife saw me watching it.
[02:41:07.589 --> 02:41:08.390]  She started laughing.
[02:41:08.410 --> 02:41:11.953]  She goes, God, that's the ultimate nerd dream.
[02:41:13.660 --> 02:41:19.082]  That a bunch of nerds tie up the bully and beat him almost to death is the quote.
[02:41:23.003 --> 02:41:36.647]  And so then they publish it everywhere that Jones was a bully that beat up all these little kids and then they tied him up like Lilliputians and knocked his teeth out.
[02:41:37.867 --> 02:41:41.008]  And it's just, I mean, he's a fantasy writer.
[02:41:42.833 --> 02:41:44.254]  And that's what they did to Kavanaugh.
[02:41:44.274 --> 02:41:47.476]  People say, why was Kavanaugh pissed, man?
[02:41:47.516 --> 02:41:49.758]  Because it was totally made up.
[02:41:51.119 --> 02:41:58.725]  And you see some crazy, bug-eyed, lunatic CIA lady, she was admittedly with the CIA, just up there lying to everybody.
[02:41:58.745 --> 02:41:59.565]  But here's the good news.
[02:42:01.226 --> 02:42:02.547]  Balazi Ford's a liar.
[02:42:03.348 --> 02:42:04.449]  John Ronson's a liar.
[02:42:05.313 --> 02:42:07.234]  And no one listens or believes them.
[02:42:07.734 --> 02:42:14.756]  Almost every YouTube comment was, you are the slimiest looking scumbag I've ever seen.
[02:42:15.456 --> 02:42:16.537]  You are a liar.
[02:42:16.917 --> 02:42:17.977]  You are a fraud.
[02:42:18.537 --> 02:42:22.178]  And it's just, we're not in a coma anymore.
[02:42:24.799 --> 02:42:26.460]  You don't just do this to us anymore.
[02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:33.522]  So how do you take a red-blooded Texan that loves America and stands up to globalist bullies and who gets banned and attacked everywhere,
[02:42:34.597 --> 02:42:35.478]  What does the left always say?
[02:42:35.978 --> 02:42:37.059]  What does Congress say about me?
[02:42:37.119 --> 02:42:38.120]  Jones is a bully.
[02:42:39.220 --> 02:42:45.405]  And so they have this script, and then they put it out there like they're wizards, and you're supposed to just accept it.
[02:42:45.485 --> 02:42:47.006]  No, we don't accept it.
[02:42:48.807 --> 02:42:50.888]  And John Ronson knows he's a liar.
[02:42:51.029 --> 02:42:52.169]  Beware John Ronson.
[02:42:52.189 --> 02:42:54.291]  Your calls, I promise, right when we come back.
[02:42:54.751 --> 02:42:55.572]  Newswars.com.
[02:42:55.652 --> 02:43:02.456]  Stay with us.
[02:43:04.187 --> 02:43:10.815]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[02:43:11.615 --> 02:43:15.400]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[02:43:15.880 --> 02:43:19.464]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[02:43:25.256 --> 02:43:26.897]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[02:43:26.957 --> 02:43:27.918]  This is racketeering.
[02:43:28.178 --> 02:43:28.998]  This is cartels.
[02:43:29.298 --> 02:43:31.399]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[02:43:31.720 --> 02:43:33.080]  We need it now.
[02:43:33.601 --> 02:43:34.861]  You can take on Big Tech.
[02:43:35.282 --> 02:43:43.686]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[02:43:44.227 --> 02:43:52.031]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[02:43:52.271 --> 02:43:53.132]  The way to fight back
[02:43:53.772 --> 02:43:58.519]  ...is to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[02:43:58.599 --> 02:44:02.385]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[02:44:09.338 --> 02:44:11.821]  Support the broadcast that tell the truth.
[02:44:12.221 --> 02:44:15.525]  Support the broadcast and do it as an act of will against the enemy.
[02:44:15.825 --> 02:44:20.310]  If they can shut this broadcast down, they have victory over free speech in totality.
[02:44:20.630 --> 02:44:21.151]  And they know that.
[02:44:21.231 --> 02:44:23.093]  And that's why everything we do is symbiotic.
[02:44:23.113 --> 02:44:28.698]  And that's why it's exciting to see people excited about the new products we have and things like Ultra 12.
[02:44:28.819 --> 02:44:30.460]  It's just a redesign of Secret 12.
[02:44:31.101 --> 02:44:32.762]  You change a formula, you're supposed to change the name.
[02:44:32.882 --> 02:44:35.823]  So it's Ultra 12 Advanced V12.
[02:44:36.003 --> 02:44:36.683]  It's amazing.
[02:44:36.763 --> 02:44:39.665]  You take it under the tongue to get better absorption.
[02:44:39.845 --> 02:44:42.666]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to the supplement page.
[02:44:42.746 --> 02:44:43.246]  It's 50% off.
[02:44:43.366 --> 02:44:45.267]  You cannot beat this.
[02:44:45.387 --> 02:44:46.027]  Nothing like it.
[02:44:46.347 --> 02:44:48.768]  $24.95 for the best vitamin B12 out there.
[02:44:48.808 --> 02:44:51.069]  Now twice as strong and now it's half off.
[02:44:51.169 --> 02:44:53.270]  Again, no reviews yet because it's really Secret 12+.
[02:44:54.050 --> 02:44:54.671]  Just came out.
[02:44:54.771 --> 02:44:57.752]  Go look at Secret 12 and its reviews and get it.
[02:44:57.972 --> 02:45:01.873]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:45:02.133 --> 02:45:09.935]  I signed a multi-year contract to be able to get you this price, and we reformulated it with the highest quality methylcobalamin that there is.
[02:45:10.115 --> 02:45:12.116]  You put it under your tongue, that's how you're able to absorb more of it.
[02:45:12.136 --> 02:45:15.217]  If you want, just gulp it down, but you only get a few percentage points that way.
[02:45:15.237 --> 02:45:16.337]  It's gotta be under the tongue.
[02:45:17.117 --> 02:45:18.078]  Second best way to have it.
[02:45:18.098 --> 02:45:18.979]  The other way is injectable.
[02:45:19.279 --> 02:45:20.900]  Gotta get that from a doctor, but it's the same stuff.
[02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:22.121]  Medical grade, methylcobalamin.
[02:45:22.281 --> 02:45:23.642]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:45:23.822 --> 02:45:25.684]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:45:25.704 --> 02:45:26.745]  50% out of the gates.
[02:45:26.765 --> 02:45:31.568]  Now, Secret 12 sold out, so this is now known as Ultra 12, because I'm not gonna just call it Secret 12 Plus.
[02:45:31.588 --> 02:45:32.089]  People don't get it.
[02:45:32.129 --> 02:45:33.790]  It's twice as much methylcobalamin.
[02:45:33.850 --> 02:45:36.752]  It's twice as strong for the same price, and we're doing it 50% off.
[02:45:36.772 --> 02:45:40.595]  You're getting very close to our cost at that, because I want you to see how amazing it is.
[02:45:40.675 --> 02:45:42.837]  You saw the thousands of five-star reviews for Secret 12.
[02:45:42.937 --> 02:45:45.479]  This is Secret 12, just twice as strong.
[02:45:45.679 --> 02:45:46.200]  Ultra 12.
[02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:47.400]  Ultra 12.
[02:45:48.121 --> 02:45:49.182]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:45:49.322 --> 02:45:50.142]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:45:50.182 --> 02:45:50.963]  You want real energy?
[02:45:51.083 --> 02:45:51.864]  You want real focus?
[02:45:52.084 --> 02:45:54.786]  So I started taking Iodine and Secret 12 five, six years ago.
[02:45:54.986 --> 02:45:56.107]  Dr. Group said this would happen.
[02:45:56.287 --> 02:45:59.409]  I had sunspots because I like the sun, I like to fish, I like to get outdoors.
[02:45:59.429 --> 02:46:04.312]  95% of the sunspots went away when I went on True Vitamin B12 Methicabolamine.
[02:46:04.453 --> 02:46:06.474]  That's why you got to remember to take your Methicabolamine.
[02:46:06.594 --> 02:46:08.355]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:08.395 --> 02:46:12.418]  God gave us things like Methicabolamine, the highest quality B12.
[02:46:13.659 --> 02:46:16.300]  And it's only in mushrooms, and it's only in, like, whale fat.
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:17.300]  In high levels.
[02:46:17.780 --> 02:46:20.001]  And most people can't absorb it, especially northern Europeans.
[02:46:20.941 --> 02:46:23.982]  But if you take our new product, Better Than Secret 12, it's the same thing.
[02:46:24.022 --> 02:46:25.423]  Methylcobalamin, twice as strong.
[02:46:25.683 --> 02:46:27.003]  I signed a multi-year contract.
[02:46:27.243 --> 02:46:28.123]  Got a great deal on it.
[02:46:28.203 --> 02:46:29.864]  It's now twice as strong.
[02:46:29.884 --> 02:46:31.945]  The strongest B12 we even know of out there.
[02:46:32.045 --> 02:46:33.065]  Pure, highest quality.
[02:46:33.205 --> 02:46:34.325]  Methylcobalamin is the best.
[02:46:34.345 --> 02:46:36.406]  It's not just highest quality B12 of some type.
[02:46:36.506 --> 02:46:37.766]  It's the best of that type.
[02:46:37.886 --> 02:46:38.367]  Of the best.
[02:46:38.447 --> 02:46:40.727]  When the caffeine don't work no more, that just stimulates the brain.
[02:46:40.747 --> 02:46:43.068]  This is what empowers the whole body in a healthy way.
[02:46:43.248 --> 02:46:44.849]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:44.969 --> 02:46:46.270]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:46:46.391 --> 02:46:47.652]  Everything we do is a win-win.
[02:46:47.732 --> 02:46:48.812]  Everything we do is a 360 win.
[02:46:48.852 --> 02:46:49.973]  Everything we do is symbiotic.
[02:46:49.993 --> 02:46:52.095]  Everything we do is positive towards life.
[02:46:52.395 --> 02:46:56.278]  Just like we sell water filters you need that are the best rated out there at the lowest price.
[02:46:56.799 --> 02:46:59.461]  You fund the info to help others while you get something helps you.
[02:46:59.841 --> 02:47:01.002]  That's God's plan.
[02:47:01.022 --> 02:47:01.462]  Stay with us.
[02:47:06.646 --> 02:47:09.309]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:54.605 --> 02:47:56.566]  Where do you guys pull up this ridiculous stuff?
[02:47:56.586 --> 02:48:01.667]  People who are like Jones have some highly calculated secret messages sent.
[02:48:02.107 --> 02:48:03.288]  That is ridiculous.
[02:48:05.048 --> 02:48:06.509]  Where are you pulling this stuff up?
[02:48:06.709 --> 02:48:07.269]  Maniacs?
[02:48:10.670 --> 02:48:12.951]  You know, I never even got to Beto and his stupid haircut.
[02:48:14.531 --> 02:48:16.092]  Or half the news that comes out.
[02:48:16.112 --> 02:48:17.012]  I don't even cover it anymore.
[02:48:17.052 --> 02:48:19.293]  We're just busy talking about how crazy things are.
[02:48:19.333 --> 02:48:20.234]  Debbie, thanks for holding.
[02:48:20.274 --> 02:48:22.054]  You're a trooper in New Jersey.
[02:48:22.074 --> 02:48:23.175]  A retired police officer.
[02:48:23.215 --> 02:48:23.855]  Views on the border.
[02:48:24.415 --> 02:48:25.736]  Trump, the Islamic training camps.
[02:48:25.756 --> 02:48:26.276]  Thanks for holding.
[02:48:27.417 --> 02:48:28.297]  Hi, Alex.
[02:48:28.697 --> 02:48:35.260]  I just want to tell you that we tried the krill oil, and it is a definite tool for metaphysical, interdimensional travel.
[02:48:35.780 --> 02:48:36.861]  No doubt.
[02:48:37.301 --> 02:48:41.523]  Well, I mean, fish oil in the brain period is amazing for dreams, but krill oil is really powerful.
[02:48:42.216 --> 02:48:43.157]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[02:48:43.177 --> 02:48:46.059]  So I just wanted to give a shout out to anybody looking for it.
[02:48:46.359 --> 02:49:06.975]  When you get it back in, because we're looking for it again, we wanted to let Mr. Trump know that with this insurrection order, we want to make sure that he swat teams these Islamic training camps in New York, and then on the other end of your list of four things that he needs to do,
[02:49:07.856 --> 02:49:10.219]  He needs to stop these chemtrails.
[02:49:10.660 --> 02:49:11.681]  Get the Air Force.
[02:49:12.042 --> 02:49:14.244]  Shoot those sons of bitches out of the sky.
[02:49:14.645 --> 02:49:15.286]  I'm sick of it.
[02:49:15.706 --> 02:49:16.487]  Everybody's sick.
[02:49:16.608 --> 02:49:18.250]  This is why people are delusional.
[02:49:21.038 --> 02:49:28.444]  Well it's true, it's true that there is, uh, globalist programs where they add barium salts, aluminum dioxide to the jet fuel, and the companies don't even know.
[02:49:28.464 --> 02:49:32.027]  There was a Nobel Prize given for the idea in 1992.
[02:49:32.887 --> 02:49:36.030]  But, I mean, the border is open, the country is collapsing.
[02:49:36.330 --> 02:49:39.713]  This is a plan, and the President has to take action against these people.
[02:49:39.753 --> 02:49:41.494]  Debbie, thank you so much for the call.
[02:49:41.994 --> 02:49:43.876]  Okay, he's been holding the longest now.
[02:49:44.416 --> 02:49:45.838]  Mike in Arizona, then Andrew.
[02:49:45.918 --> 02:49:47.479]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:49:48.604 --> 02:49:49.585]  Yes, good morning.
[02:49:49.985 --> 02:49:53.107]  You asked the question, what should President Trump do about the border?
[02:49:53.608 --> 02:50:02.875]  Number one, he needs to identify these cartels as insurgent groups, the big cartels, Sinaloa cartel, Los Zetas, Gulf cartels, CJNG.
[02:50:03.455 --> 02:50:12.482]  When we sit here and call them drug trafficking organizations or multinational criminal organizations, it conjures up the thought that they need to be gone after by the police.
[02:50:12.542 --> 02:50:13.403]  The police cannot
[02:50:13.943 --> 02:50:14.263]  We're good.
[02:50:31.472 --> 02:50:44.775]  The one president, Salvador Soren, he was a member of that group, and he just left office after six years, and they've just elected another member of the FMLN in El Salvador.
[02:50:45.335 --> 02:50:53.417]  Back in 1999, there was Tricoms, a couple of colonels in the Air Force, wrote a book called Unlimited Warfare.
[02:50:54.117 --> 02:50:57.559]  And it's very insightful into what is being waged.
[02:50:57.700 --> 02:51:06.926]  It's the wage, how smaller countries can go after bigger countries through social, political, economic, internet, and that's exactly what we're seeing.
[02:51:07.506 --> 02:51:14.351]  The next issue, The War of the Flea, written in 1965 by Robert Tabor over 50 years ago.
[02:51:14.771 --> 02:51:20.735]  He points out about all these revolutionary groups, whether it was from Mao, Cuba,
[02:51:21.355 --> 02:51:26.361]  Absolutely, and the Weathermen by the 70s is an official plan to open the borders, flood the country, radicalize them, cause mass riots.
[02:51:42.034 --> 02:51:42.995]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:51:43.375 --> 02:51:49.959]  Recently, the presidential candidate in Guatemala, he was arrested in Miami within the last two weeks.
[02:51:50.019 --> 02:51:58.163]  He had asked the Sinaloa cartel to supply him with $10 million for his presidential campaign and to kill his rivals.
[02:51:58.543 --> 02:52:04.427]  And he's been indicted, arrested here in the United States on drug and gun charges.
[02:52:05.107 --> 02:52:10.151]  Another deal is when we're just ties into identifying these cartels as insurgent groups.
[02:52:10.811 --> 02:52:21.819]  There's a concept that's called using an irregular security force in a counterinsurgency operation and what it basically is that the police and the civilians can't handle it.
[02:52:22.219 --> 02:52:34.988]  So you send the military in to clear out an area, and then you bring in your trained irregular security force, the militia, and the police, because they have a vested interest in the security of their neighborhoods.
[02:52:35.388 --> 02:52:42.813]  They know who belongs there, they recognize the vehicles that come in and out of there, and they can usually respond much quicker than the...
[02:52:52.479 --> 02:53:00.201]  The easiest thing to do is you have all these insurgents like Kamala Harris and others saying overthrow the government, take the guns, open the borders up.
[02:53:00.541 --> 02:53:01.462]  These aren't Americans.
[02:53:01.802 --> 02:53:05.463]  These are foreign terrorists working with the Chai Kams to overthrow the country.
[02:53:05.483 --> 02:53:12.184]  So I don't know why we just sit here and let the command and control continue to do this, you know, unless certain people in our government think it's a good idea.
[02:53:12.504 --> 02:53:13.845]  And we know the government's overthrown.
[02:53:14.645 --> 02:53:16.566]  Hey Alex, how are you today?
[02:53:43.888 --> 02:53:45.449]  Just crazy times, my friend.
[02:53:45.489 --> 02:53:46.789]  I just can't believe it's gotten this nuts.
[02:53:48.070 --> 02:53:49.430]  Oh, I know it never ends, does it?
[02:53:49.710 --> 02:53:56.033]  Liberals and Democrats are on a never-ending satanic spree of killing little babies and coming after us good-hearted Americans.
[02:53:56.053 --> 02:53:57.774]  They want to destroy us at every second they get.
[02:53:57.794 --> 02:53:58.734]  Oh, they're that bad.
[02:53:58.794 --> 02:54:00.255]  I mean, they're that bad.
[02:54:00.315 --> 02:54:06.917]  I have videos of leftists attacking women all over the country and death-threatening pro-lifers and saying kill babies after they're born.
[02:54:07.217 --> 02:54:08.378]  I mean, they're just bad people.
[02:54:09.605 --> 02:54:11.107]  Well, they'll kill babies after they're born.
[02:54:11.507 --> 02:54:17.533]  The American ones, they want to kill all the American babies, but then everybody that's outside of the country, they want to usher them right in to take this country over.
[02:54:17.553 --> 02:54:23.479]  Because when Americans are here, we're going to stand up for our country, and we're going to make sure that the American value system stays in place.
[02:54:24.140 --> 02:54:26.582]  All these people from outside the country, they're so desperate.
[02:54:27.022 --> 02:54:31.507]  My wife came here illegally from Nicaragua at 12 years old.
[02:54:32.285 --> 02:54:38.148]  All these stories you hear from the left that they want to say that nothing happened to these people crossing the border and these people are good people.
[02:54:38.188 --> 02:54:47.173]  My wife came here to escape all the misery and chaos and socialist dictatorship of Ortega down there in Nicaragua to get her to a better life.
[02:54:47.193 --> 02:54:48.574]  She's now a naturalized U.S.
[02:54:48.594 --> 02:54:49.014]  citizen.
[02:54:49.415 --> 02:54:50.575]  She holds American values.
[02:54:50.615 --> 02:54:51.616]  She loves Donald Trump.
[02:54:51.656 --> 02:54:53.657]  She respects him for what he wants to do for our country.
[02:54:54.358 --> 02:54:58.426]  Her mother, unfortunately on the way here, people say these coyotes are just helping people over here.
[02:54:58.807 --> 02:55:01.974]  Her mother was raped multiple times by them on her way over here.
[02:55:02.415 --> 02:55:04.399]  So for people to just sit here and constantly
[02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:07.082]  Badger us over the head that the right is wrong.
[02:55:07.162 --> 02:55:09.384]  Us conservative Americans, we don't know what we're talking about.
[02:55:09.404 --> 02:55:11.265]  We're just racist bigots.
[02:55:11.325 --> 02:55:11.505]  No.
[02:55:11.545 --> 02:55:17.030]  Well, I mean, that's because Robert Rodriguez makes movies where Don Johnson and Machete is shooting pregnant Mexicans.
[02:55:17.530 --> 02:55:19.412]  There's nobody shooting pregnant Mexicans on this side.
[02:55:19.452 --> 02:55:21.413]  That's what Mexico's doing to their own people.
[02:55:21.593 --> 02:55:22.574]  It's incredible.
[02:55:22.614 --> 02:55:23.835]  God bless you, Andrew.
[02:55:23.875 --> 02:55:24.616]  I appreciate your call.
[02:55:25.076 --> 02:55:25.997]  And the proof's in the pudding.
[02:55:26.157 --> 02:55:28.018]  Why does everybody want to come here if we're so bad?
[02:55:28.519 --> 02:55:29.780]  But it won't be like that soon, folks.
[02:55:31.018 --> 02:55:35.341]  This is a planned takedown of the country, and these third-world populations are being used.
[02:55:35.401 --> 02:55:37.142]  I'm very, very sad for them, but this is serious.
[02:55:37.942 --> 02:55:45.127]  Just briefly, as listeners mentioned it, we're about to end the special on a free bottle of X3 with a bottle of X2, 25% off, m4restore.com.
[02:55:45.727 --> 02:55:46.968]  We have the new product.
[02:55:47.028 --> 02:55:51.431]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very same Methodist Bottleman, highest quality Ultra 12.
[02:55:53.208 --> 02:55:54.109]  It's 50% off as well.
[02:55:54.149 --> 02:55:56.451]  That's how we fund our operations.
[02:55:56.491 --> 02:55:58.832]  So thank you very much for your support.
[02:55:58.872 --> 02:55:59.793]  We couldn't do it without you.
[02:56:00.294 --> 02:56:02.235]  Shelly in Arizona, last caller of this hour.
[02:56:02.295 --> 02:56:02.916]  Shelly, go ahead.
[02:56:03.796 --> 02:56:04.097]  Hello, sir.
[02:56:04.217 --> 02:56:04.457]  Hi.
[02:56:06.903 --> 02:56:07.823]  I forgot what I was going to say.
[02:56:07.863 --> 02:56:09.164]  People keep calling me.
[02:56:09.484 --> 02:56:11.084]  I just want to plug your products real quick.
[02:56:11.824 --> 02:56:14.285]  The other day, I bought six t-shirts.
[02:56:14.925 --> 02:56:21.487]  My son is currently wearing the 50 caliber 1776 Come and Take It shirt to school today.
[02:56:21.507 --> 02:56:22.727]  That's awesome.
[02:56:23.127 --> 02:56:30.089]  And I'm fixing to get me some of that V12 stuff and on a roll for my son, so I can't wait.
[02:56:30.209 --> 02:56:30.889]  Thank you for the support.
[02:56:30.950 --> 02:56:31.730]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[02:56:31.770 --> 02:56:32.570]  Shelly, what's on your mind?
[02:56:33.737 --> 02:56:34.497]  Yes, sir.
[02:56:34.618 --> 02:56:42.322]  I'm calling from down south in Arizona, and we do have a problem down here with the illegals.
[02:56:42.482 --> 02:56:51.268]  It's not quite as bad as in the other areas, but I do believe that it's going to get here sooner or later, and that is my fear.
[02:56:51.328 --> 02:57:02.694]  I've been having this reoccurring dream for years that a horde of illegals comes up out of the wash down by my mother and father's ranch and take over the house.
[02:57:02.755 --> 02:57:03.395]  I mean, they've been
[02:57:04.076 --> 02:57:07.958]  They've been robbed before, and these people don't take food.
[02:57:08.258 --> 02:57:10.179]  They've sold cash and guns.
[02:57:10.339 --> 02:57:15.782]  So, I mean, what is their agenda other than to come and take us over?
[02:57:15.902 --> 02:57:32.270]  And I believe this whole invasion is a well-planned, well-funded strategic attack, and the trigger was pulled once Trump won the election, and I support him, and I believe this needs to be stopped, and it needs to be stopped now.
[02:57:32.510 --> 02:57:33.451]  I think it's too late.
[02:57:34.349 --> 02:57:37.733]  I mean, I agree with you on that point, but he needs to do something now.
[02:57:38.353 --> 02:57:38.874]  Absolutely.
[02:57:38.914 --> 02:57:42.057]  I mean, they were already beta testing under Obama, but as soon as Trump got in, it's just boom.
[02:57:42.458 --> 02:57:43.399]  Break the border, U.N.
[02:57:43.439 --> 02:57:44.840]  attack, then blame Trump.
[02:57:44.900 --> 02:57:45.601]  It's incredible.
[02:57:45.641 --> 02:57:46.542]  It's so dangerous.
[02:58:13.928 --> 02:58:15.089]  You have heard the evidence.
[02:58:15.910 --> 02:58:16.130]  Guilty.

[02:58:39.188 --> 02:58:39.328]  Guilty
[02:58:40.157 --> 02:58:42.318]  2.2 billion people just got told they can't use certain words.
[02:58:42.358 --> 02:58:46.880]  They're announcing giant COVID-19... I see it everywhere, but everyone already innately knows this.
[02:58:46.900 --> 02:58:50.082]  These people are not freaking humans, okay?
[02:58:50.242 --> 02:58:52.443]  Hillary Clinton is a goddamn demon!
[02:58:52.463 --> 02:58:54.444]  They're taking my bank accounts.
[02:58:54.464 --> 02:58:56.044]  They're taking Uber from everybody.
[02:58:56.064 --> 02:58:57.525]  They're taking everything from me.
[02:58:57.605 --> 02:59:04.168]  I don't like to put generals in the water that turn the freaking frogs gay!
[02:59:04.228 --> 02:59:06.909]  I'm sick of being social engineered.
[02:59:07.049 --> 02:59:07.710]  It's not funny!
[02:59:10.052 --> 02:59:12.434]  You care about the real American s**t, or you don't.
[02:59:12.874 --> 02:59:14.675]  And if you do, it goes for every side.
[02:59:14.835 --> 02:59:18.458]  I don't like Alex Jones, but Alex Jones gets to speak.
[02:59:18.758 --> 02:59:28.204]  And this shocking footage is even more painful when you see the albatrosses of CNN and other MSM outlets cheering on the rape.
[02:59:28.885 --> 02:59:39.252]  In fact, it's been found that these systems actually direct the monstrous CEO, Zuckerberg, against the free speech enemies and anyone that tries to not submit.
[02:59:39.992 --> 02:59:51.702]  But most sad of all is other penguins in the independent media simply looking up at the sky and ignoring the vicious rape of their own freedoms and birthright taking place right in front of them.
[02:59:56.507 --> 03:00:00.390]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in resistance.
[03:00:05.382 --> 03:00:12.369]  What I hate is looking out and seeing chemtrails in a clear blue sky today.
[03:00:12.569 --> 03:00:25.803]  What I hate is hitting roadblocks on a highway in my way.
[03:00:33.746 --> 03:00:41.012]  A lot of crazy stuff going on, folks.
[03:00:41.032 --> 03:00:42.273]  That's Merle Haggard bringing us in.
[03:00:42.713 --> 03:00:48.138]  I'll hit a few news stories, then hand the baton over to Dr. Nick Begich here in just a moment.
[03:00:48.158 --> 03:00:49.579]  I appreciate everybody that's called in.
[03:00:49.599 --> 03:00:50.680]  I'll get to a few more right now.
[03:00:52.942 --> 03:00:59.688]  But there's a lot of stories on Infowars.com that really show the hate increasing as pro-libraries are being threatened with murder everywhere.
[03:01:01.297 --> 03:01:02.378]  It's just getting crazier.
[03:01:02.458 --> 03:01:15.467]  And then one of the filmmakers that put out the film, You Can't Watch This, he went on RT and they had a quote, Islamic scholar on saying, you don't get free speech.
[03:01:16.448 --> 03:01:18.969]  That's my thing about Islam is it's anti-free speech stance.
[03:01:19.690 --> 03:01:24.833]  So we'll play a clip of that coming up, but right now let's talk to Mike in Maryland.
[03:01:24.853 --> 03:01:25.734]  Thanks for holding Mike.
[03:01:26.034 --> 03:01:26.575]  You're on the air.
[03:01:26.595 --> 03:01:28.616]  Hey Alex Jones, how you doing man?
[03:01:28.896 --> 03:01:29.477]  Thanks for calling.
[03:01:29.497 --> 03:01:29.757]  Go ahead.
[03:01:30.615 --> 03:01:32.556]  Hey, so I just want to do a real quick plug.
[03:01:32.636 --> 03:01:33.977]  I got a lot of your products, man.
[03:01:33.997 --> 03:01:37.860]  The Colon Cleanse, the Survival Shield, I give that to my kids.
[03:01:38.500 --> 03:01:40.202]  The Colon Cleanse, my wife, she's
[03:01:41.303 --> 03:01:41.643]  Thank you.
[03:02:05.521 --> 03:02:08.683]  Yes, so I watched a lot of your stuff.
[03:02:08.703 --> 03:02:10.564]  I've been watching you for a while now.
[03:02:11.165 --> 03:02:18.749]  It really awoken me to nationalism and the importance of patriotism.
[03:02:18.769 --> 03:02:21.051]  My grandfather, he was a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force.
[03:02:21.904 --> 03:02:23.746]  And, uh, high-level intelligence.
[03:02:23.786 --> 03:02:32.853]  I mean, I have documents, you know, sitting in my house where, you know, he'd write manuscripts to, um, you know, President Bush and Reagan back in the day.
[03:02:32.893 --> 03:02:48.866]  But, um, one thing that I think, you know, Trump's doing his best right now, but with the overload of information that we're having nowadays, that's where I see a lot of intelligence failures happening, and that's really a lot of the work that my grandfather attempted to do.
[03:02:48.946 --> 03:02:49.947]  But, uh, you know,
[03:02:50.484 --> 03:02:54.966]  Higher-ups in the military tried to push him out also because of the information that he was bringing to the table.
[03:02:55.607 --> 03:03:08.173]  And, you know, when you had that interview with Farrakhan, I think it was really interesting because Farrakhan, he touched upon an issue of the fact that other people should, you know, fight for their own kind.
[03:03:08.513 --> 03:03:18.779]  And, you know, Louis Farrakhan, he's a little old school, but with earlier, when I called in, you guys were talking about the immigration, and it goes back to the 1924 immigration law that was passed.
[03:03:19.361 --> 03:03:34.489]  Where at first it was a merit-based system where they had quotas on all the groups that were coming to the United States, whether it be through the island in New York.
[03:03:34.729 --> 03:03:41.393]  As the law evolved to the 1965 immigration law, it was changed from a merit-based law to a family-based law.
[03:03:42.177 --> 03:03:45.380]  And it turned more into like a kinship sort of thing.
[03:03:45.941 --> 03:03:57.933]  And a lot of the groups that spearheaded it were leftist Jewish organizations that blamed the 1924 law on the Jews that were turned away during the Holocaust.
[03:03:58.013 --> 03:03:59.555]  You know, that is a funny piece of history.
[03:03:59.575 --> 03:04:02.277]  I actually was researching immigration years ago and learned that.
[03:04:03.078 --> 03:04:03.839]  I don't know.
[03:04:20.254 --> 03:04:27.041]  Actual fatwas out against them to be killed, you know, Christian women and people in Pakistan because it'll make the Muslims upset.
[03:04:27.822 --> 03:04:30.584]  But yeah, there's a lot of strange history there.
[03:04:31.065 --> 03:04:37.271]  There's also a lot of making money off migrant groups that people bring in who they then kind of handle and control.
[03:04:38.354 --> 03:04:38.874]  Exactly.
[03:04:39.215 --> 03:04:39.995]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:04:40.135 --> 03:04:44.779]  And news going back to South Africa where they're having the, you know, the real white genocide that's going on there.
[03:04:44.799 --> 03:04:46.820]  I'm glad that Trump, you know, tweeted out to that.
[03:04:47.460 --> 03:04:57.207]  And just the reports there are just the same person that was, you know, that headed up an organization with the Rwanda genocide said that it's in like the final stages.
[03:04:57.247 --> 03:04:58.068]  They're actually trying to hide it.
[03:04:58.108 --> 03:05:00.950]  Well, that's happened in every African country so far where the U.N.
[03:05:00.970 --> 03:05:01.390]  takes over.
[03:05:01.410 --> 03:05:02.191]  They kill all the white people.
[03:05:03.069 --> 03:05:03.990]  The Globalist News.
[03:05:24.227 --> 03:05:30.250]  Ultra-purified krill oil and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[03:05:30.710 --> 03:05:42.216]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[03:05:42.696 --> 03:05:51.941]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[03:05:52.521 --> 03:05:56.308]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[03:05:56.869 --> 03:06:01.338]  Try Honor Roll from InfoWars Life at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:24.887 --> 03:06:25.428]  Welcome back.
[03:06:25.488 --> 03:06:26.729]  Alex Jones here live.
[03:06:26.789 --> 03:06:28.530]  Dr. Nick Magich, always informative.
[03:06:28.590 --> 03:06:29.591]  He's about to take over.
[03:06:29.911 --> 03:06:34.936]  The War Room is up in about 54 minutes with Owen Troyer.
[03:06:36.417 --> 03:06:38.659]  So here's just some of the headlines I've got here.
[03:06:39.299 --> 03:06:46.606]  Facebook suspends Candace Owens for saying liberal policies incentivize fatherless homes.
[03:06:49.028 --> 03:06:49.468]  That's right.
[03:06:51.667 --> 03:06:53.347]  That's just some of the stuff going on.
[03:06:53.387 --> 03:06:58.349]  New York Times columnist lauds inevitable demographic decline of racist white people.
[03:06:58.949 --> 03:07:04.230]  Because whites are inherently bad, but he sure fights to get into a white, at least white-founded country.
[03:07:06.071 --> 03:07:07.131]  It's just sick.
[03:07:09.291 --> 03:07:14.173]  Pro-abortion advocates violence against pro-life women.
[03:07:16.113 --> 03:07:18.354]  50,000 people like her tweet.
[03:07:18.494 --> 03:07:19.754]  That's another InfoWars.com
[03:07:21.539 --> 03:07:28.624]  And then liberals threaten to kill and rape pro-life writer and his family.
[03:07:28.724 --> 03:07:29.925]  What nice people.
[03:07:33.988 --> 03:07:35.208]  And this is just part of the course.
[03:07:35.248 --> 03:07:36.049]  And then there's the film.
[03:07:36.069 --> 03:07:38.551]  It's now available for download or viewing.
[03:07:39.731 --> 03:07:41.453]  That is titled, You Can't Watch This.
[03:07:41.533 --> 03:07:44.355]  YouCan'tWatchThis.com or CensoredMovie.com.
[03:07:44.455 --> 03:07:45.035]  It's now out.
[03:07:45.656 --> 03:07:46.796]  Hope you'll get it and watch it.
[03:07:47.237 --> 03:07:47.957]  Support free speech.
[03:07:50.154 --> 03:07:58.199]  One of the producers of the film, Kalen, was on the show with a Muslim reformist.
[03:07:59.860 --> 03:08:01.380]  There's no free speech in Islamic countries.
[03:08:01.821 --> 03:08:09.425]  The chair of the Islamic Human Rights Commission just called gay conservative author a Muslim reformist.
[03:08:10.425 --> 03:08:12.907]  And he had another person he was interviewing, Kalen, on the show.
[03:08:13.327 --> 03:08:17.730]  Panic over online hate is being exploited to silence mainstream opinions.
[03:08:17.750 --> 03:08:18.190]  Here's the clip.
[03:08:19.614 --> 03:08:20.555]  I think there's a double standard.
[03:08:20.575 --> 03:08:21.375]  But where do you draw the line?
[03:08:21.395 --> 03:08:23.277]  You only focus on people on the right.
[03:08:23.337 --> 03:08:27.860]  You've only focused on Majid Nawaz, who by the way you called a hate creature.
[03:08:27.880 --> 03:08:30.121]  Douglas Murray, normal conservative people.
[03:08:30.161 --> 03:08:31.082]  Where would you draw the line?
[03:08:33.837 --> 03:08:48.972]  Well, hate preachers are the ones that actually put, you know, Douglas Murray and Manjit Nawaz, etc., hate preachers because of the fact that they're associating act of terrorism with ordinary law-abiding citizens, Muslim community.
[03:08:49.552 --> 03:08:49.993]  For that,
[03:08:50.333 --> 03:09:03.464]  There are hate preachers, because they're actually promoting that level of violence of terrorists with ordinary Muslim community members who have shown, overall, their law-abiding intentions.
[03:09:03.484 --> 03:09:06.847]  I just can't believe you'd sit on television and say that Majid Nawaz incited terrorism.
[03:09:06.927 --> 03:09:12.212]  He is a Muslim, he's been one of the most outspoken people in Britain in terms of condemning the far-right.
[03:09:12.232 --> 03:09:12.972]  No, no, no, look.
[03:09:15.669 --> 03:09:18.091]  No, you're totally not.
[03:09:18.111 --> 03:09:19.192]  You're putting words in my mouth.
[03:09:19.272 --> 03:09:20.874]  I said, actually, he's a hate preacher.
[03:09:22.135 --> 03:09:24.036]  So, hate is this nebulous word.
[03:09:25.938 --> 03:09:27.920]  Hate is this completely nebulous term.
[03:09:29.361 --> 03:09:32.704]  If someone's calling for violence, organizing criminal actions, that's illegal.
[03:09:32.724 --> 03:09:33.365]  That's terrorism.
[03:09:34.079 --> 03:09:35.540]  That's criminal mafia behavior.
[03:09:36.020 --> 03:09:43.683]  But then just saying everyone's hateful, that you want silence, but then they leave all the Islamists on European television saying, kill everybody.
[03:09:44.263 --> 03:09:45.684]  People are seeing through this.
[03:09:47.805 --> 03:09:49.265]  And it's coming to a political end.
[03:09:49.325 --> 03:09:50.286]  People are turning against it.
[03:09:50.406 --> 03:09:52.666]  That's why the globalists are trying to flood countries.
[03:09:53.187 --> 03:09:54.807]  That's why they're trying to cause infighting.
[03:09:55.227 --> 03:10:01.270]  That's why they're trying to cause division, because they know people are waking up to it and it's not working anymore.
[03:10:04.209 --> 03:10:13.976]  But in my view, the larger problem is the domestic populations of low-grade morons who've got a couple college degrees, can't find jobs.
[03:10:14.576 --> 03:10:20.501]  They believe that we're supposed to have the socialist utopia now that they will have a place in as the ruling class.
[03:10:21.761 --> 03:10:28.406]  And if they don't get that position, they get madder and they get madder and they attack more people.
[03:10:29.887 --> 03:10:31.929]  Because now is supposedly the time
[03:10:33.723 --> 03:10:36.805]  for them to be able to take control.
[03:10:53.161 --> 03:10:55.623]  But that's what this has all come down to.
[03:10:56.023 --> 03:10:57.524]  So here is that report.
[03:10:57.564 --> 03:11:00.305]  It's on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[03:11:00.345 --> 03:11:01.546]  I hope you'll share this.
[03:11:02.006 --> 03:11:03.467]  But this is just, these aren't liberals.
[03:11:03.487 --> 03:11:04.367]  These aren't conservatives.
[03:11:04.968 --> 03:11:11.712]  These are craved media heads that want to just waddle around and feel like they're in charge and you better do what they say.
[03:11:11.752 --> 03:11:12.092]  Here it is.
[03:11:13.012 --> 03:11:15.695]  I'm gonna grow a magnificent pair of breasts!
[03:11:16.616 --> 03:11:19.298]  I'm going to transition into a woman!
[03:11:19.719 --> 03:11:20.379]  It'll be great!
[03:11:20.680 --> 03:11:33.112]  You should crawl back into your mother's rancid womb, gestate for a few more hours, slide back out, and then learn something about not being an entitled, white, piece of s***!
[03:11:33.552 --> 03:11:34.654]  This is trotting people!
[03:11:35.394 --> 03:11:36.635]  When the rubber meets the road,
[03:11:37.476 --> 03:11:38.297]  Pussies!
[03:11:38.398 --> 03:11:39.319]  Yeah, you're a f**king idiot.
[03:11:39.499 --> 03:11:40.280]  F**k you, capitalism!
[03:11:40.300 --> 03:11:41.502]  F**k you, f**king president!
[03:11:41.782 --> 03:11:44.225]  He's a racist, stupid piece of s**t!
[03:11:44.345 --> 03:11:47.730]  If you guys are working for Alex Jones, you're working for a murderer!
[03:11:48.191 --> 03:11:50.333]  Alex Jones is an a**hole.
[03:11:50.674 --> 03:11:52.817]  InfoWars is fake news!
[03:11:56.240 --> 03:11:57.161]  I got a chair going.
[03:11:57.341 --> 03:12:02.184]  If you had to choose one prominent person to be banned next, who would you choose?
[03:12:02.785 --> 03:12:03.005]  You.
[03:12:03.565 --> 03:12:06.167]  This is what's happening to the men in our country.
[03:12:06.207 --> 03:12:07.148]  Where are the men?
[03:12:07.168 --> 03:12:07.748]  Stop touching my stuff.
[03:12:07.768 --> 03:12:08.409]  I'm backing away.
[03:12:08.449 --> 03:12:08.569]  Stop.
[03:12:17.415 --> 03:12:18.876]  Hey, hey, hey, don't be doing that.
[03:12:18.896 --> 03:12:19.417]  Why are you doing that?
[03:12:19.457 --> 03:12:21.318]  What are you, what are you doing, mother f***er?
[03:12:21.358 --> 03:12:22.199]  What are you doing?
[03:12:22.379 --> 03:12:23.660]  Get the f***ing stuff in it!
[03:12:23.700 --> 03:12:24.301]  Don't film it!
[03:12:24.341 --> 03:12:25.041]  You're not allowed!
[03:12:25.081 --> 03:12:25.962]  You can't use it!
[03:12:26.082 --> 03:12:31.046]  I'll turn back your, uh... Please do not touch me.
[03:12:31.126 --> 03:12:32.367]  Please do not touch me.
[03:12:32.747 --> 03:12:33.548]  Once again, it's me.
[03:12:34.128 --> 03:12:35.830]  I actually said both of you guys.
[03:12:35.890 --> 03:12:38.112]  Right beforehand, you f***ing said, sir!
[03:12:38.272 --> 03:12:41.594]  Is there a boob strut on my shirt because I'm a liberated woman?
[03:12:41.614 --> 03:12:41.895]  I am!
[03:12:42.055 --> 03:12:44.997]  Trump supporters are pushers!
[03:12:49.292 --> 03:12:49.952]  Take it outside!
[03:12:49.972 --> 03:12:52.514]  I will show you what you deserve!
[03:12:52.654 --> 03:12:53.274]  Motherfucker!
[03:12:53.314 --> 03:12:57.277]  Get the fuck out of my face!
[03:12:57.777 --> 03:12:59.198]  Go home!
[03:12:59.478 --> 03:13:00.118]  Go home!
[03:13:00.178 --> 03:13:00.438]  Go home!
[03:13:00.478 --> 03:13:01.979]  What's your fucking problem?
[03:13:01.999 --> 03:13:02.660]  Film it, bro.
[03:13:02.700 --> 03:13:03.280]  Film it.
[03:13:03.360 --> 03:13:05.741]  Yeah, I'm filming it.
[03:13:05.942 --> 03:13:07.723]  What the fuck did you do to me?
[03:13:10.864 --> 03:13:12.846]  How's this?
[03:13:14.186 --> 03:13:15.287]  Did you farted on me?
[03:13:20.769 --> 03:13:23.530]  Get the hell out of here!
[03:13:23.590 --> 03:13:35.453]  Get these people the hell out of here right now!
[03:13:35.493 --> 03:13:35.934]  Fuck off!
[03:13:36.074 --> 03:13:37.214]  I don't give a fuck!
[03:13:37.254 --> 03:13:37.614]  Get out!
[03:13:37.674 --> 03:13:38.034]  Oh, shit!
[03:13:38.334 --> 03:13:38.754]  Please, please!
[03:13:38.794 --> 03:13:40.295]  Fucking terrible person!
[03:13:40.355 --> 03:13:40.875]  Please!
[03:13:45.595 --> 03:13:49.657]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's where our society is going.
[03:13:51.058 --> 03:13:52.079]  These are not intellectuals.
[03:13:52.119 --> 03:13:53.099]  These are not quality people.
[03:13:53.139 --> 03:13:55.841]  They've been told by the power structure, you're in charge.
[03:13:55.901 --> 03:13:57.022]  It's your right to rule now.
[03:13:57.162 --> 03:13:57.862]  Open the borders.
[03:13:58.583 --> 03:13:59.343]  Take the country.
[03:14:00.104 --> 03:14:00.764]  Bring it down.
[03:14:00.864 --> 03:14:02.025]  You'll get free health care.
[03:14:02.065 --> 03:14:02.885]  You'll get free college.
[03:14:02.905 --> 03:14:04.306]  You'll get free homes.
[03:14:04.326 --> 03:14:05.387]  You don't have to work anymore.
[03:14:06.307 --> 03:14:09.149]  As the Green Plan says, everything is going to be heaven.
[03:14:11.124 --> 03:14:25.804]  This is what happens when you have a bunch of deranged meth heads and Prozac heads that don't have jobs just wandering around spoiled, throwing fits in class, just taking course after course going deeper into debt of social justice warrior stuff.
[03:14:27.182 --> 03:14:28.463]  And this is who they are.
[03:14:28.663 --> 03:14:37.426]  And because they have big tech and Hollywood behind them, it's creating this gross spectacle where they think they have unlimited power.
[03:14:38.627 --> 03:14:42.208]  Sorry to Tyler and Anthony and Chris and Samford and Danny, I'm out of time.
[03:14:43.429 --> 03:14:49.631]  Dr. Nick Begich, always informative and always a lot of breaking news from Alaska is taking over.
[03:14:49.651 --> 03:14:51.392]  And then, like I said, Owen Schroer will be here.
[03:14:53.246 --> 03:14:54.288]  A lot more is coming up this weekend.
[03:14:54.308 --> 03:14:56.512]  I'll be back this Saturday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:14:56.552 --> 03:14:57.273]  A lot of big stuff.
[03:14:57.293 --> 03:14:58.775]  It's obviously going to be unfolding.
[03:14:59.497 --> 03:15:02.542]  Trump getting ready to declare this real national emergency, because we are in an emergency.
[03:15:02.942 --> 03:15:04.264]  An existential, globalist threat.
[03:15:04.325 --> 03:15:05.406]  It's a very dangerous time.
[03:15:06.533 --> 03:15:13.280]  But also a time of great opportunity and that's why they want us off air because every person that hears the truth now can make sense of what's going on.
[03:15:13.300 --> 03:15:25.713]  So that's why I commend you all for what you're doing and encourage you all and thank you all for spreading the links to Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, over email, over text message where it's hard for them to censor it.
[03:15:26.394 --> 03:15:29.796]  And Word of Mouth, and then on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, all those places.
[03:15:30.297 --> 03:15:34.300]  But that's how we're able to reach new people so they can find out the verboten information.
[03:15:34.840 --> 03:15:37.202]  The globalists are betting against you and humanity and myself.
[03:15:37.802 --> 03:15:39.143]  We're betting against their system.
[03:15:39.703 --> 03:15:41.925]  Now, Dr. Nick Begich is betting on all of us as well.
[03:15:42.345 --> 03:15:45.948]  He takes over on the other side, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:15:46.488 --> 03:15:47.129]  Pray for peace.
[03:15:47.149 --> 03:15:50.231]  The neocons want to start wars to derail the recovery.
[03:15:50.891 --> 03:15:52.352]  And pray for people to become enlightened.
[03:15:52.853 --> 03:15:53.253]  Stay with us.
[03:15:53.273 --> 03:15:54.674]  We'll be right back with Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:15:54.694 --> 03:15:55.595]  Stay with us.
[03:16:02.222 --> 03:16:15.422]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[03:16:16.912 --> 03:16:23.255]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with.
[03:16:23.355 --> 03:16:25.315]  And it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[03:16:26.176 --> 03:16:30.678]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[03:16:31.518 --> 03:16:36.400]  But then you add, not to the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there,
[03:16:37.139 --> 03:16:37.499]  Literally.
[03:16:38.240 --> 03:16:48.986]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the tumeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[03:16:49.807 --> 03:16:53.829]  Now, ultimate bone broth can be gulped down with water or milk or however you want to.
[03:16:54.109 --> 03:16:55.270]  The taste is okay.
[03:16:55.670 --> 03:16:58.732]  But when you mix it with whey or other things and some fruit, it tastes great.
[03:16:59.292 --> 03:16:59.973]  What I like to do
[03:17:00.373 --> 03:17:03.054]  It's just put a scoop in, mix it with milk, bang it back.
[03:17:03.114 --> 03:17:09.395]  And whether it's for meal replacement, whether it's for post-workout, pre-workout, our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing.
[03:17:10.075 --> 03:17:14.356]  It's 50% off right now at InFullMorseTour.com because I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[03:17:14.736 --> 03:17:17.237]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[03:17:17.617 --> 03:17:23.799]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taking on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[03:17:24.499 --> 03:17:27.700]  Now, this is high quality and it's very thick, so doing it with a spoon takes a while.
[03:17:27.860 --> 03:17:29.060]  That's why I like to use a blender.
[03:17:35.506 --> 03:17:36.586]  Again, I love it with milk.
[03:17:37.587 --> 03:17:38.727]  Just bang this baby back.
[03:17:38.747 --> 03:17:45.911]  Mmm.
[03:17:46.011 --> 03:17:47.151]  Nothing like it for a meal replacement.
[03:17:47.171 --> 03:17:48.832]  It's way beyond any way you've ever had.
[03:17:48.852 --> 03:17:55.015]  Again, it's got the essence of the bones, the chaga mushroom, the turmeric, a bunch of other incredible stuff.
[03:17:55.495 --> 03:17:58.176]  This is what fuels patriots.
[03:17:58.196 --> 03:17:59.837]  This is what fuels people that really want to be healthy.
[03:17:59.857 --> 03:18:02.118]  It's ultimate bone broth at InFootwearLife.com.
[03:18:06.892 --> 03:18:08.834]  The dodo is an extinct bird.
[03:18:09.134 --> 03:18:12.038]  Big, fat, juicy, delicious birds the size of a turkey.
[03:18:12.178 --> 03:18:13.299]  They never had a predator.
[03:18:13.319 --> 03:18:15.982]  There weren't any wolves, there weren't any foxes, there weren't any dogs.
[03:18:16.002 --> 03:18:18.044]  There's nothing but these birds running around on this island.
[03:18:18.244 --> 03:18:22.609]  And within just a few years of sailors finding the island, whaling ships would go stop there.
[03:18:23.630 --> 03:18:27.253]  They just walk up with a boar and just club him in the head and eat him.
[03:18:27.273 --> 03:18:28.254]  Big ol' fat juicy meal.
[03:18:28.394 --> 03:18:31.017]  So the dodo... People call people a dodo.
[03:18:31.037 --> 03:18:33.899]  They're stupid and don't care about themselves and fall off the edge of a cliff.
[03:18:33.919 --> 03:18:34.360]  They're stupid.
[03:18:34.420 --> 03:18:36.401]  But it was they'd never seen humans.
[03:18:36.441 --> 03:18:37.642]  They'd never had a predator.
[03:18:37.662 --> 03:18:38.984]  They had no fear.
[03:18:39.064 --> 03:18:40.165]  Well, let me tell you something.
[03:18:40.185 --> 03:18:42.807]  If I was a chicken, I'm running around like my head's cut off.
[03:18:42.967 --> 03:18:44.048]  And you know why I feel like that?
[03:18:44.108 --> 03:18:44.728]  Why I'm pissed?
[03:18:44.928 --> 03:18:47.050]  Because my instincts are lined up and normal.
[03:18:47.130 --> 03:18:48.251]  We have world government.
[03:18:48.291 --> 03:18:50.533]  We have Democrats saying they're killing babies after they're born.
[03:18:50.613 --> 03:18:52.594]  We have sex education to five-year-olds.
[03:18:52.694 --> 03:18:55.596]  We have total evil Hollywood demoralizing us.
[03:18:55.656 --> 03:18:56.817]  They attack on the family.
[03:18:56.917 --> 03:18:57.658]  All these lies.
[03:18:57.798 --> 03:19:02.321]  We have criminal collapse news networks calling anyone that doesn't submit to them Nazis.
[03:19:02.461 --> 03:19:06.324]  And then using their fake claim that you're a Nazi to have your bank accounts taken.
[03:19:06.404 --> 03:19:07.365]  That's what the Nazis did.
[03:19:07.505 --> 03:19:10.868]  And as a man, I become physically angry at this point.
[03:19:11.288 --> 03:19:13.450]  You don't fundamentally get pissed at that.
[03:19:13.550 --> 03:19:14.571]  You're a dodo bird.
[03:19:14.752 --> 03:19:15.953]  Folks, I'm not a dodo bird.
[03:19:16.073 --> 03:19:17.615]  And I'm not gonna compare myself to an eagle.
[03:19:17.735 --> 03:19:19.897]  Let me just compare myself to a chicken.
[03:19:20.237 --> 03:19:23.340]  Chicken sees a hawk fly over, that chicken runs for the bushes.
[03:19:24.261 --> 03:19:27.184]  That chicken goes... To tell others, hey...
[03:19:27.805 --> 03:19:29.607]  The hawk that eats this, he just flew over.
[03:19:29.828 --> 03:19:34.853]  You see, the Dodos were on that island for probably millions of years and nothing ever ate them.
[03:19:34.874 --> 03:19:37.236]  At least hundreds of thousands, so they didn't have a race memory.
[03:19:37.316 --> 03:19:44.565]  But you can take a chicken or any other creature that's ever been around predators and they know about predators, they know what they look like, even though
[03:19:51.155 --> 03:19:54.617]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:24.742 --> 03:20:30.358]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Nick Baggage.
[03:20:36.335 --> 03:20:41.637]  And welcome back to InfoWars.com.
[03:20:41.697 --> 03:20:42.937]  And this is Nick Begich.
[03:20:42.997 --> 03:20:48.999]  And, you know, listening to the program today, you know, a lot of different topics were touched upon.
[03:20:49.039 --> 03:20:58.102]  And those that are watching, the images in the background now are ones I sent down that I've shot in various locations here in Alaska.
[03:20:59.263 --> 03:21:06.187]  So you'll get the authentic neck baggage view of some of the more beautiful places here in our state.
[03:21:06.207 --> 03:21:13.392]  In fact, well, before I came on, we were talking about a little bit about Alaska to one of the guys producing the program.
[03:21:13.612 --> 03:21:17.895]  Connor, I appreciate your work today and everyone there at InfoWars.
[03:21:18.935 --> 03:21:21.678]  But you know, it's springtime actually in Alaska.
[03:21:21.698 --> 03:21:27.222]  The leaves are just coming out in Anchorage and I was joking about spring break here in March.
[03:21:27.302 --> 03:21:27.923]  Kind of a joke.
[03:21:28.003 --> 03:21:31.966]  It's like a winter number two break.
[03:21:32.767 --> 03:21:39.893]  But in any case, Alaska really a wonderful place and the images you're looking at are our summer images.
[03:21:40.033 --> 03:21:46.799]  If you can see us online, you know, when you and some of the glacial shots and some of those classic sort of Alaska images.
[03:21:47.549 --> 03:21:58.913]  But you know, I think about this place, Alaska, and my father, who first came here in the 1950s, the early 50s, before statehood, when it was still a territory.
[03:21:59.433 --> 03:22:02.375]  And my dad, he was a first generation American.
[03:22:02.415 --> 03:22:07.677]  You know, we've been talking a bit about immigration today and the border and the need to secure the border.
[03:22:07.737 --> 03:22:16.700]  And I certainly favor that concept coming from an immigrant background that came in the front door, which I think is the appropriate way to enter.
[03:22:17.652 --> 03:22:35.973]  The country and you know, and I'm thinking about all this today and in terms of my travels around the world sort of where I go and what I see and the invasion going on at our southern border from Latin America and the variances in Latin countries.
[03:22:35.993 --> 03:22:38.336]  I mean, because there's a big difference, you know, you can't just lump
[03:22:39.182 --> 03:22:40.042]  Everyone together.
[03:22:40.082 --> 03:22:41.443]  They're very different cultures.
[03:22:41.643 --> 03:22:46.765]  Every country I've ever been to in Latin America and I've been in South America.
[03:22:46.785 --> 03:22:51.327]  I've been to Brazil and I've been to Ecuador and Peru and Colombia and Venezuela.
[03:22:52.688 --> 03:22:55.889]  I've been in Central America, El Salvador.
[03:22:56.570 --> 03:22:58.691]  I've been to Costa Rica.
[03:22:59.191 --> 03:23:01.152]  I've been to most of the Caribbean.
[03:23:01.172 --> 03:23:08.355]  I've been Columbia, you know, a lot of all of the Caribbean except for Cuba.
[03:23:10.217 --> 03:23:17.585]  In the Dominican, I haven't been, but you know, so traveling around that part of the world, there are some very big differences.
[03:23:18.226 --> 03:23:25.474]  You can't lump them all together, you know, and when you start to look at the differences culturally and you ask, why are people running away?
[03:23:26.583 --> 03:23:34.070]  And why is our government supporting really corrupt governments where these people are running away in the way that they are?
[03:23:34.590 --> 03:23:51.966]  You know, you go back in time to different periods in American history when people were like leaving Ireland and coming to the United States because of the potato famine and things that drove people in the 1800s to leave there and then later people in the Baltic countries leaving for various reasons.
[03:23:52.646 --> 03:23:59.949]  But really the big reasons were economic, weren't they?
[03:24:00.489 --> 03:24:01.050]  From Europe.
[03:24:01.110 --> 03:24:02.630]  You couldn't own enough land.
[03:24:02.670 --> 03:24:04.811]  It was poor agriculturally in Ireland.
[03:24:04.831 --> 03:24:07.372]  A lot of Europe you couldn't own land.
[03:24:07.412 --> 03:24:08.973]  Land was out of the question.
[03:24:09.013 --> 03:24:11.094]  Where you could, you just had no way to make the money.
[03:24:12.546 --> 03:24:22.291]  You know, I mean, it was still locked a hundred years ago, really, at a lot of sort of the two classes of population.
[03:24:22.331 --> 03:24:29.794]  America offered a middle class opportunity where you could come in dirt poor and build something and do something and create something here.
[03:24:30.694 --> 03:24:40.060]  And the door was open, and we welcomed people in the front door, not running through our borders playing games with the law, but honoring the law.
[03:24:40.120 --> 03:24:41.981]  You know, I looked up a couple things in my
[03:24:42.853 --> 03:24:50.057]  Family's Archive in advance of the program and, you know, and I've had the opportunity to even travel back to where my grandfather came from.
[03:24:50.117 --> 03:24:59.643]  And in the last program I did, we got into a little bit of this discussion about the concept of multi-generational memory in terms of values and what that represents.
[03:25:00.343 --> 03:25:02.865]  And, you know, I'm 60 now.
[03:25:02.885 --> 03:25:04.205]  I may not look it, but I'm 60.
[03:25:05.846 --> 03:25:12.150]  And I knew my great grandmother, who is my grandchildren's great, great, great grandmother.
[03:25:12.924 --> 03:25:23.632]  So that's a lot of generations, you know, of spanning an understanding of our history as a family, but also our history within the culture of the United States.
[03:25:24.753 --> 03:25:39.524]  And then having the opportunity to travel out of the United States to where my grandfather came from in Croatia, and maybe with the guys in the booth can get a map of Southern Europe, the Mediterranean, and show Croatia across from Italy.
[03:25:40.024 --> 03:25:41.425]  And it's a very small country.
[03:25:41.445 --> 03:25:57.540]  It was part of Yugoslavia before the, you know, back in time when my grandfather left, and then it became Yugoslavia, the merger of a bunch of those states, and later then broken back up in the 93 wars.
[03:25:57.620 --> 03:26:04.546]  And my son and I, together with one of my business partners and my cousin from Croatia, my oldest son Nicholas,
[03:26:05.467 --> 03:26:06.888]  He's 41 this year.
[03:26:07.509 --> 03:26:17.418]  He's got offices in Zagreb, actually, along with Chicago and Chennai, India, and here in Anchorage.
[03:26:18.599 --> 03:26:24.305]  But in Croatia, I had the opportunity to travel back to the village my grandfather
[03:26:25.817 --> 03:26:26.938]  And it hasn't changed.
[03:26:28.020 --> 03:26:30.663]  He left in 1906 and it hasn't changed since.
[03:26:30.703 --> 03:26:31.344]  He was born in 1890.
[03:26:32.785 --> 03:26:42.436]  I remember as a kid talking to him, he watched the whole industrial age move into what now and things I've reported on is the technocracy.
[03:26:42.517 --> 03:26:45.220]  He watched it from the automobile, the beginning of the airplane,
[03:26:46.221 --> 03:26:51.765]  He walked from central Croatia from his village to a place called Dubrovnik on the coast.
[03:26:52.666 --> 03:27:00.593]  I visited those places and visited my cousins living on the same farm that my grandfather left in 1906.
[03:27:02.094 --> 03:27:13.964]  And just as poor, making the equivalent of about $130 a month for a household of six, and largely agricultural still, you know, growing and raising
[03:27:14.617 --> 03:27:30.038]  Most of their own food and creating their own heat through wood fired wood stoves, you know, the same way I was living for a number of years here in Alaska in the wilderness, pretty remote, but still on a road system.
[03:27:30.479 --> 03:27:31.100]  Croatia.
[03:27:31.932 --> 03:27:38.157]  Still is very similar to where it was when my grandfather left.
[03:27:38.657 --> 03:27:39.478]  Why did he leave?
[03:27:39.518 --> 03:27:41.760]  He left because there was opportunity in the United States.
[03:27:41.780 --> 03:27:44.842]  He came here, he had nothing, he worked hard.
[03:27:44.862 --> 03:27:52.528]  I mean, he was a laborer with no English, worked his way in the mines in Minnesota, northern Minnesota.
[03:27:54.424 --> 03:28:04.359]  Raised four children and then my father left in the 1950s, came to Alaska, became a state senator, a superintendent of schools, teacher, and later a U.S.
[03:28:04.399 --> 03:28:05.621]  congressman.
[03:28:05.681 --> 03:28:07.083]  First generation American.
[03:28:07.144 --> 03:28:08.566]  So, you know, when I think about
[03:28:09.486 --> 03:28:27.210]  Immigration, it's not very far removed from me and certainly not removed from my memory talking to my grandfather who spoke broken English about what it was like to come here and leave the country where he was born and then to travel back there with my oldest son.
[03:28:27.250 --> 03:28:30.491]  My grandfather never went back and he fully integrated.
[03:28:30.511 --> 03:28:32.832]  In fact, he did not allow in his household.
[03:28:32.912 --> 03:28:34.912]  People didn't in those days.
[03:28:35.972 --> 03:28:37.393]  They didn't allow you to speak
[03:28:39.264 --> 03:28:39.985]  Okay, so
[03:29:04.497 --> 03:29:09.360]  Casey, I'm sure it's wishful thinking you're saying, Tyra comes right from nowhere, is he on turbo force?
[03:29:09.841 --> 03:29:13.984]  Which is an amazing pre-workout and long-term energy system, unlike any other.
[03:29:14.584 --> 03:29:16.906]  Or Tyra Woods isn't actually taking turbo force, is he?
[03:29:17.126 --> 03:29:18.867]  That's a good idea though, I should try to send him some.
[03:29:19.327 --> 03:29:21.709]  I'm not entirely sure, but when I was watching the man
[03:29:21.909 --> 03:29:22.890]  I'll have to try to find out.
[03:29:22.990 --> 03:29:23.130]  I know.
[03:29:23.150 --> 03:29:26.071]  I've been told by multiple folks that are friends with him.
[03:29:26.091 --> 03:29:28.773]  He's a listener, but I don't really worry about stuff like that.
[03:29:28.793 --> 03:29:29.513]  But that's great.
[03:29:29.533 --> 03:29:30.033]  Who knows?
[03:29:30.073 --> 03:29:31.474]  He might be on Turbo Force.
[03:29:31.494 --> 03:29:31.834]  Who knows?
[03:29:44.161 --> 03:29:50.225]  Well, last year, when he won his first tournament in a long time, they tried to grill him on, like, degrading the president in some way.
[03:29:50.245 --> 03:29:53.407]  You know, this is what you need in a press conference after a golf tournament, and he wouldn't do it.
[03:29:53.547 --> 03:29:54.548]  I know, he's friends with Trump.
[03:29:54.588 --> 03:29:55.969]  He's been friends with Trump, like, 20 years.
[03:29:56.109 --> 03:29:56.769]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:29:56.789 --> 03:29:58.410]  The media wasn't even talking about his win.
[03:29:58.450 --> 03:29:59.971]  They were talking about his politics.
[03:30:00.011 --> 03:30:00.592]  Thank you, Casey.
[03:30:12.608 --> 03:30:16.850]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[03:30:16.970 --> 03:30:17.751]  They are technocrats.
[03:30:18.031 --> 03:30:20.132]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[03:30:20.752 --> 03:30:27.616]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[03:30:28.516 --> 03:30:29.997]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[03:30:30.397 --> 03:30:32.519]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[03:30:33.039 --> 03:30:39.283]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[03:30:39.443 --> 03:30:40.203]  And I'm not perfect.
[03:30:40.664 --> 03:30:41.604]  I work a lot of hours.
[03:30:42.164 --> 03:30:47.148]  And if I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[03:30:47.788 --> 03:30:56.793]  That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlemen and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[03:30:57.774 --> 03:31:03.437]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter you're going to find anywhere.
[03:31:03.777 --> 03:31:07.199]  That's what we set out with top developers in the United States to do.
[03:31:07.479 --> 03:31:11.021]  It took us years to up the quality and be able to concentrate it like this.
[03:31:11.661 --> 03:31:12.882]  Secret 12 is still amazing.
[03:31:13.562 --> 03:31:15.903]  This is the next level.
[03:31:15.943 --> 03:31:17.063]  This is Ultra 12.
[03:31:17.503 --> 03:31:23.045]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.

[03:31:26.766 --> 03:31:27.386]  It tastes great.
[03:31:27.766 --> 03:31:29.086]  There's no sweeteners, no additives.
[03:31:29.386 --> 03:31:30.086]  It is amazing.

[03:31:43.430 --> 03:31:47.072]  Thank you for your support, and thank you for taking care of your own body.
[03:32:06.178 --> 03:32:07.139]  Marcos, thanks for holding.
[03:32:07.199 --> 03:32:09.300]  I really appreciate you joining us on this Friday edition.
[03:32:09.340 --> 03:32:09.921]  What's your view?
[03:32:09.961 --> 03:32:10.581]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[03:32:10.661 --> 03:32:11.762]  I appreciate you having me on.
[03:32:11.802 --> 03:32:13.584]  First off, I wanted to thank you for the body.
[03:32:13.644 --> 03:32:24.912]  I've been using it for a while, but I sent the bottle to my mom, and after taking it for a few days, she called me literally in tears, saying that she could see the knuckles on her fingers again and, like, the bones in her knees again.
[03:32:24.932 --> 03:32:25.873]  She was ecstatic.
[03:32:25.913 --> 03:32:32.538]  So, personal thank you to you for that, because anybody who makes my mom's life a little bit easier has a special place in my heart.
[03:32:32.698 --> 03:32:33.218]  Tumor-y.
[03:32:34.139 --> 03:32:36.922]  Curry in India is powerful.
[03:32:36.942 --> 03:32:39.184]  The average turmeric product is about 3-5%.
[03:32:39.284 --> 03:32:39.644]  Ours is 95%.
[03:32:39.684 --> 03:32:42.667]  The strongest curcuminoid out there.
[03:32:43.268 --> 03:32:45.930]  So Advil works great when I got twisted ankle.
[03:32:46.311 --> 03:32:49.694]  This is nature's Advil to the next level.
[03:32:50.294 --> 03:32:52.216]  So that's why Bodies is so incredible.
[03:32:52.256 --> 03:32:54.578]  People should really check it out and support the InfoWars.
[03:32:54.599 --> 03:32:58.022]  So thank you for giving us your testimony about your mother because Bodies is amazing.
[03:32:58.122 --> 03:32:58.903]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[03:33:06.113 --> 03:33:10.176]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.383 --> 03:33:25.104]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.525 --> 03:33:26.985]  Because there is a war on.
[03:33:27.446 --> 03:33:28.406]  For your mind.
[03:33:29.067 --> 03:33:30.968]  With Nick Begich.
[03:33:36.738 --> 03:33:39.701]  And welcome back and welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:33:39.781 --> 03:33:50.313]  I appreciate being here and I appreciate everybody helping out in the studio today and talking about this multi-generational memory and why it's important.
[03:33:50.333 --> 03:33:56.540]  I'm giving part of my own story in the context of this because it's immigration after all what we're talking about here.
[03:33:56.600 --> 03:33:57.501]  My family came in
[03:33:58.301 --> 03:33:59.042]  The front door.
[03:33:59.062 --> 03:34:01.263]  I believe in the rule of law.
[03:34:01.303 --> 03:34:03.065]  My family certainly does.
[03:34:03.165 --> 03:34:06.367]  I have my father was a state senator, a U.S.
[03:34:06.427 --> 03:34:13.832]  congressman, my brother, second-generation American, a mayor, an assemblyman, a U.S.
[03:34:13.892 --> 03:34:17.254]  senator, my other younger brother, a state senator.
[03:34:17.274 --> 03:34:18.335]  You know,
[03:34:19.036 --> 03:34:23.677]  When you think about the opportunities of this country, they're incredible.
[03:34:23.697 --> 03:34:26.718]  It's easy to understand why people want to come here.
[03:34:26.858 --> 03:34:35.640]  But as I was saying before the break, in those generations past that brought us here, we integrated into the culture that was here.
[03:34:35.960 --> 03:34:41.501]  And I was saying before the break, my grandfather forbid his children from speaking
[03:34:43.362 --> 03:34:48.064]  Croatia, Yugoslav languages, Slavic languages in the household.
[03:34:48.104 --> 03:34:48.645]  They didn't do it.
[03:34:48.685 --> 03:34:51.326]  They lived in a neighborhood and it was all Yugoslavian immigrants.
[03:34:52.446 --> 03:34:53.887]  But all the families were the same.
[03:34:53.907 --> 03:34:55.247]  Their kids didn't speak it.
[03:34:55.387 --> 03:34:56.488]  My dad understood it.
[03:34:56.988 --> 03:35:03.451]  I mean, he could hear it and understand it, but he couldn't speak it even as an adult because he was forbidden.
[03:35:03.731 --> 03:35:06.172]  And that was a level of integration, you know.
[03:35:06.272 --> 03:35:07.833]  And my dad was
[03:35:08.954 --> 03:35:13.956]  A very principled man in terms of values and how he viewed the country.
[03:35:14.396 --> 03:35:20.079]  His background was a school teacher, and his background was history, is what he studied.
[03:35:20.459 --> 03:35:27.282]  Russian history, Eastern history, in terms of the Eastern European history particularly, and he was an expert.
[03:35:27.462 --> 03:35:31.004]  I mean, my dad was a brilliant, brilliant man.
[03:35:31.724 --> 03:35:38.347]  When I think about what's going on on our southern border and the fact I've traveled a lot through Latin America, you know, Mexico I won't even go to anymore.
[03:35:39.231 --> 03:35:41.453]  On a free trip, I won't go anymore.
[03:35:42.134 --> 03:35:43.635]  Because it's a criminal state.
[03:35:44.516 --> 03:35:48.319]  And the president of Mexico, the new one, I hope he can clean it up.
[03:35:48.839 --> 03:35:58.948]  Because that's part of the problem at the border, is you have a criminal state that is a gangster state at our southern border, that we have appeased for years.
[03:35:59.248 --> 03:36:07.755]  And when 10% of the adult population is running away from a country that's right next to ours, we have to ask why.
[03:36:08.496 --> 03:36:34.936]  A country that has tremendous natural resources, beaches, coastline, natural resources, silver, copper, iron, magnesium, every industrial metal under the sun, oil, gas, and it's been looted for a couple hundred years, for hundreds of years actually, beginning with Spain and the families that came from Spain and looted Mexico and continue
[03:36:35.596 --> 03:36:46.907]  Through their lineage to loot the country and through other billionaires that have been born out of that looting in Mexico, that have bankrupted the people of Mexico.
[03:36:47.527 --> 03:36:50.730]  So they're running away because that's happened.
[03:36:50.750 --> 03:36:53.773]  And what has the United States done in response to this historically?
[03:36:54.274 --> 03:36:55.775]  Defended the government of Mexico.
[03:36:55.795 --> 03:37:00.059]  You remember when the Yucatan, they were rebelling in the Yucatan because they were fed up
[03:37:00.839 --> 03:37:07.323]  With all of it, the lawlessness, the craziness, they wanted a revolution because they were sick of it.
[03:37:07.343 --> 03:37:11.586]  And we provided resources under the Clinton administration to suppress that revolution.
[03:37:12.766 --> 03:37:17.049]  You know, and this country was founded on revolution.
[03:37:18.270 --> 03:37:28.796]  You know, when I think about going back to my grandfather's village and going in the middle of the town and looking at the war memorial and seeing the list of all of my relations that were killed in the war,
[03:37:29.807 --> 03:37:31.208]  Not a certain feeling about that.
[03:37:31.688 --> 03:37:34.110]  And then you see the ones killed in 93.
[03:37:35.130 --> 03:37:38.752]  Actually, just one direct relationship.
[03:37:38.833 --> 03:37:43.315]  And it's the mother of my cousin who I went to visit in Croatia.
[03:37:43.375 --> 03:37:44.996]  She was slaughtered like an animal.
[03:37:45.016 --> 03:37:46.517]  They found her on her front porch.
[03:37:48.946 --> 03:37:53.287]  In 93, you know, that's not very long ago in anyone's memory.
[03:37:54.227 --> 03:37:57.068]  You know, the world is a very unstable place.
[03:37:57.728 --> 03:38:03.570]  When you look around the world, what happens within the world also touches us no matter where we live.
[03:38:04.390 --> 03:38:09.351]  But sort of exporting democracy that we've tried, that doesn't work.
[03:38:10.191 --> 03:38:12.112]  Regime change doesn't work.
[03:38:13.005 --> 03:38:15.486]  Interfering with other people's elections doesn't work.
[03:38:16.226 --> 03:38:20.128]  I'm not talking about this bull about the Russians.
[03:38:20.188 --> 03:38:24.990]  I'm talking about what we do as a country, because we do that all over the world.
[03:38:25.530 --> 03:38:33.473]  People come here for economic reasons, for opportunities that are legitimately here, but come in the front door.
[03:38:33.753 --> 03:38:35.794]  And immigration is healthy.
[03:38:35.834 --> 03:38:36.654]  We get a lot of
[03:38:37.354 --> 03:38:41.840]  Really interesting people when we allow immigration, and we do.
[03:38:42.621 --> 03:38:45.524]  We've been generous, we're the most generous country on the planet.
[03:38:47.146 --> 03:38:54.615]  But it has to be orderly and respectful of law, because we're not interested in importing criminal states and moving them here.
[03:38:55.683 --> 03:38:56.023]  No.
[03:38:56.944 --> 03:39:07.309]  In fact, the policy of the United States should be to support those seeking democracy or Republican government in other parts of the world, certainly.
[03:39:08.430 --> 03:39:14.193]  But how do we do that and protect our borders and allow balanced immigration?
[03:39:14.233 --> 03:39:16.254]  We certainly did it successfully in the past.
[03:39:16.554 --> 03:39:18.095]  I got an image I want to pop up.
[03:39:18.155 --> 03:39:19.316]  It's of my grandparents.
[03:39:20.616 --> 03:39:25.019]  And it's a document I had them do a little shot of, and maybe they can run that up.
[03:39:25.579 --> 03:39:30.543]  But it's when they came over, you know, and it's their citizenship papers.
[03:39:31.223 --> 03:39:39.069]  You know, and I mentioned my grandfather came over in 1906, but he didn't become a citizen until the 20s.
[03:39:39.209 --> 03:39:41.731]  It took a long time to become a citizen even back then.
[03:39:41.751 --> 03:39:46.774]  You had to learn English, you had to learn the whole thing, you had to integrate into the culture.
[03:39:47.254 --> 03:39:52.118]  The same with my grandmother, you know, and you'll see if we can get that up, guys, I don't know whether we should.
[03:39:52.992 --> 03:39:53.393]  All right.
[03:39:53.993 --> 03:39:54.614]  Next segment.
[03:39:54.654 --> 03:39:55.715]  They'll get it the next segment.
[03:39:55.735 --> 03:39:56.776]  They say they got a little problem.
[03:39:58.037 --> 03:40:00.260]  But you know what's important about all of this is
[03:40:01.005 --> 03:40:02.646]  There was, it was orderly.
[03:40:02.887 --> 03:40:04.328]  You know, my grandmother was here.
[03:40:04.448 --> 03:40:07.891]  I don't know the exact date of when she came to the United States.
[03:40:07.971 --> 03:40:09.112]  My grandfather, I do, 1906.
[03:40:11.594 --> 03:40:14.436]  And he was 16, 16 years old.
[03:40:14.476 --> 03:40:17.859]  He left his country, didn't know anything, came through New York, through Ellis Island.
[03:40:19.260 --> 03:40:29.889]  And then in coming through Ellis Island to Minnesota and then working underground in the mines for a buck and a quarter a day before they went open pit in northern Minnesota on the Iron Range.
[03:40:30.566 --> 03:40:33.487]  You know, that's my dad left there.
[03:40:33.507 --> 03:40:41.110]  He got to Alaska with 11 bucks with a job and 11 bucks and built something here.
[03:40:41.130 --> 03:40:52.054]  And when I think about all that and the opportunities present to every generation, we forget that, you know, and how blessed we are to be here, but under the rule of law.
[03:40:52.714 --> 03:40:54.614]  And I think that's what we're missing right now.
[03:40:54.735 --> 03:40:58.556]  And at the same time, respecting the right of others
[03:40:59.548 --> 03:41:08.713]  Within their boundaries to have their own revolutions and quit interfering with them on the guise of our value system.
[03:41:08.773 --> 03:41:09.573]  It's not up to us.
[03:41:09.654 --> 03:41:16.737]  It's up to them within their sovereign boundaries to form their governments to make them reflect who they are, whatever that means.
[03:41:17.618 --> 03:41:19.179]  And I think that's reasonable enough.
[03:41:19.279 --> 03:41:22.721]  We don't have to interfere or be threatened by someone.
[03:41:24.481 --> 03:41:26.043]  Evolving a form of governance.
[03:41:26.083 --> 03:41:40.241]  I don't care whether you want a theocracy, or you want a democracy, a straight democracy, or a republic like ours, or some other, a parliamentarian form of government, or some dictatorship you're willing to tolerate and not rebel against.
[03:41:40.762 --> 03:41:41.683]  If that's what you want.
[03:41:42.406 --> 03:41:49.869]  But I don't think it's up to us to always be the police of the world to tell people what their value system ought to look like.
[03:41:50.189 --> 03:41:52.110]  And that's what has happened historically.
[03:41:52.530 --> 03:41:57.492]  So we have an immigration because we've interfered with everybody's politics through Central and South America.
[03:41:57.872 --> 03:42:01.353]  And we didn't keep the war at home where it belonged.
[03:42:02.361 --> 03:42:26.433]  You know, we didn't let them deal with their revolutions and change out their governments and create whatever they wanted down there in terms of a form that worked and support something in terms of informing, creating the opportunity for people to see the world perhaps a little bit differently by an example here in the United States that allows for orderly immigration, the highest in the world.
[03:42:27.566 --> 03:42:35.212]  That has built the biggest economy on the planet until recently, challenged now by the Chinese because of the globalists.
[03:42:35.693 --> 03:42:40.056]  And I want to get into that whole thing in the next segment, because that's what's dividing us right now.
[03:42:40.597 --> 03:42:49.724]  It's a globalist agenda that's getting us to fight over things that fundamentally we should be in agreement on the security of our national borders, for goodness sake.
[03:42:50.213 --> 03:42:51.175]  We're going to be right back.
[03:42:51.215 --> 03:42:52.216]  This is InfoWars.

[03:45:04.631 --> 03:45:09.092]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:45:09.312 --> 03:45:14.013]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[03:45:14.613 --> 03:45:20.454]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[03:45:20.834 --> 03:45:33.476]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you can actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[03:45:34.236 --> 03:45:35.797]  Unlike other systems.
[03:45:35.857 --> 03:45:41.340]  I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues.
[03:45:41.360 --> 03:45:42.941]  He writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[03:45:42.961 --> 03:45:44.822]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[03:45:45.162 --> 03:45:46.283]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[03:45:46.303 --> 03:45:47.583]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[03:45:47.783 --> 03:45:48.964]  He doesn't drink anything.
[03:45:49.184 --> 03:45:50.644]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[03:45:51.164 --> 03:45:52.785]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[03:45:53.105 --> 03:45:54.565]  I only have to take one knockout.
[03:45:54.925 --> 03:45:57.526]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[03:45:57.566 --> 03:45:58.426]  This is insane.
[03:45:58.846 --> 03:46:00.466]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[03:46:00.706 --> 03:46:03.267]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[03:46:03.707 --> 03:46:05.227]  He says, this is totally free.
[03:46:05.267 --> 03:46:07.088]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[03:46:07.108 --> 03:46:08.968]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[03:46:09.828 --> 03:46:15.770]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[03:46:16.010 --> 03:46:17.350]  All just moderate dose.
[03:46:18.885 --> 03:46:26.876]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[03:46:26.896 --> 03:46:29.299]  So, that's available infullwarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:29.339 --> 03:46:30.480]  But thank you for committing.
[03:46:34.546 --> 03:46:37.367]  To get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[03:46:37.748 --> 03:46:40.349]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[03:46:40.369 --> 03:46:45.131]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing billions and then, you know, funding race war.
[03:46:45.591 --> 03:46:51.714]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[03:46:51.754 --> 03:46:54.876]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[03:46:55.196 --> 03:46:56.517]  It's called reap what you sow.
[03:47:05.623 --> 03:47:21.848]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.009 --> 03:47:28.531]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Nick Vagic.
[03:47:29.211 --> 03:47:31.972]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:37.256 --> 03:47:38.297]  And welcome back.
[03:47:38.858 --> 03:47:49.266]  What you're seeing on the screen, if you can see this today, is me flying over to one of my really remote properties in a helicopter in Alaska in the fall.
[03:47:49.306 --> 03:47:54.831]  So the ground is like this popcorn color and the mountains are just starting to get the snow cap.
[03:47:54.931 --> 03:48:00.175]  Anyway, I sent the InfoWars a lot of good film and footage and some of the stuff that
[03:48:01.269 --> 03:48:03.109]  That's familiar to me in my part of the world.
[03:48:03.770 --> 03:48:12.012]  And so those that see this on screen and those that can't and are hearing us on radio, go look at it on Infowars.com and check it out.
[03:48:12.072 --> 03:48:15.433]  That's a waterfall from my property up in the Wrangell Mountains.
[03:48:17.133 --> 03:48:17.733]  Way up!
[03:48:18.773 --> 03:48:20.474]  So there's a lot going on.
[03:48:20.514 --> 03:48:27.575]  You know, when I think about that property, I was reading the history on it recently, and that's one of the ways in.
[03:48:28.336 --> 03:48:29.456]  If you're looking at that, that
[03:48:30.496 --> 03:48:36.821]  Super Cub, the pilot, has a world record for landing and taking off on the shortest runway in the most radical spaces.
[03:48:37.281 --> 03:48:38.962]  And that was our pilot we used one year.
[03:48:39.723 --> 03:48:43.306]  Flying into our property, kind of an interesting way to go.
[03:48:43.346 --> 03:48:46.188]  It only takes one passenger at a time, so we had to make three trips in.
[03:48:47.092 --> 03:48:52.117]  You know, and this property was actually, it's remote, it's tough to get into.
[03:48:52.137 --> 03:48:54.119]  It used to have a road over a hundred years ago.
[03:48:54.519 --> 03:49:00.004]  About the time my grandfather was coming in to the United States, this property was just getting developed.
[03:49:00.064 --> 03:49:00.845]  It was discovered in 1898.
[03:49:04.031 --> 03:49:12.279]  And interesting, you know, how Alaska goes, but so much of it is just the way it always was, you know, and and remains remote.
[03:49:12.959 --> 03:49:15.401]  I was born here just before statehood.
[03:49:16.102 --> 03:49:17.904]  We were still a territory at the time.
[03:49:17.924 --> 03:49:19.245]  And when I think about
[03:49:20.023 --> 03:49:30.430]  You know, sort of how Alaska evolved along and how my family, you know, grew up here with statehood and what it represents and the missed opportunities.
[03:49:30.470 --> 03:49:33.953]  You know, Alaska is 18% of the landmass, something I talk about often.
[03:49:34.954 --> 03:49:41.879]  The opportunities here and those who just saw us flying off the edge of a cliff, that was a way to get out of that airstrip.
[03:49:41.899 --> 03:49:43.079]  You couldn't get the airspeed up.
[03:49:43.199 --> 03:49:45.361]  The airstrip is not there.
[03:49:45.401 --> 03:49:47.883]  It's just a side of a mountain we're taking off from.
[03:49:48.644 --> 03:49:55.152]  And you need airspeed so you can only go so fast and you drop off the cliff and you get the airspeed and you pop up a half a mile away.
[03:49:56.033 --> 03:49:57.576]  So that's how it works in Alaska.
[03:49:57.796 --> 03:50:00.019]  You know when you think about
[03:50:01.436 --> 03:50:08.521]  The differences, you know, I'm talking to Connor a little bit off there, and the differences in our cultures within the same country.
[03:50:09.042 --> 03:50:16.627]  You know, Alaska is like a lot of the United States was a hundred or more years ago for most of it.
[03:50:17.147 --> 03:50:20.430]  And most of it undisturbed, totally undisturbed.
[03:50:20.570 --> 03:50:24.993]  You know, when we came back into this area of Alaska, into this valley,
[03:50:25.753 --> 03:50:35.285]  It was, everything was left, you know, two blacksmith shops caved in, you know, a camp of 40 men and a post office all collapsed, a couple of standing buildings.
[03:50:35.385 --> 03:50:37.047]  But, you know, when you think about
[03:50:37.808 --> 03:50:44.731]  How things were, how things develop throughout our lives and go through these cycles.
[03:50:45.231 --> 03:50:46.952]  Alaska had a bunch of cycles.
[03:50:46.972 --> 03:50:52.855]  You know, we had the pre-colonial period of the Russians and what they did is a fur trade.
[03:50:52.895 --> 03:50:56.396]  They were into getting what they could and they only got along the coast.
[03:50:56.416 --> 03:50:57.857]  They never made it very far inland.
[03:50:58.816 --> 03:51:04.539]  In 1867, the United States bought Alaska under Seward Spaulding, they called it at the time.
[03:51:04.599 --> 03:51:15.884]  We paid two cents an acre, two cents an acre for the place, 586,000 square miles, 640 acres to the square mile, a little over 7 million bucks.
[03:51:16.684 --> 03:51:19.065]  It was the deal of the century.
[03:51:19.785 --> 03:51:25.848]  But the czar figured at the time he needed the money and he figured we were going to take it anyway because we were kind of in the mood to take
[03:51:26.768 --> 03:51:27.449]  We're good to go.
[03:51:45.524 --> 03:52:08.332]  This place, a wealth of natural resources, and you look at Russia across the ocean from us, a wealth of natural resources on the ground in both Russia, Siberia, United States, Alaska, Canada, the British Columbia, Yukon territories, the wealthiest
[03:52:09.112 --> 03:52:13.277]  Chunks of the world being opened up in the Yukon and British Columbia.
[03:52:13.737 --> 03:52:16.860]  Diamonds are being discovered in massive quantities.
[03:52:18.302 --> 03:52:22.206]  De Beers has interest there as well as other independents in Alaska.
[03:52:22.306 --> 03:52:26.570]  Huge amounts of land are being looked at now again revitalized for
[03:52:31.095 --> 03:52:32.196]  We're good to go.
[03:52:47.194 --> 03:52:53.039]  One percent is privately held, nine percent is Native American held, and the rest is federal and state lands.
[03:52:53.059 --> 03:52:57.944]  You know, we used to have homesteading here until the mid-1960s.
[03:52:58.044 --> 03:53:06.011]  We still had, up until the 1970s, we had home sites where you could claim up to five acres of federal land and create a home site.
[03:53:06.851 --> 03:53:09.613]  Or you could create a business site, a trade center, and so on.
[03:53:10.033 --> 03:53:21.861]  Those laws were abolished in the 1970s, leaving most of this federal unappropriated land, over 104 million acres, which is appropriated into parks, preserves, wildlife refuges.
[03:53:21.881 --> 03:53:29.046]  You know, I have property that is 600 feet from a wilderness area where nothing can be built.
[03:53:29.904 --> 03:53:30.965]  We're good.
[03:53:47.359 --> 03:53:52.203]  Okay, so these are that's me up on some of my property in the Wrangell Mountains.
[03:53:54.545 --> 03:53:59.788]  Hiking around and you know, it's a pretty remote spot up there.
[03:54:00.029 --> 03:54:06.113]  That's me in the Valdez area up above Valdez Glacier a few years ago.
[03:54:06.513 --> 03:54:10.676]  My first trip I took my eldest son out into the wilderness and this was
[03:54:12.526 --> 03:54:18.709]  You know, when I think about it, you know, what we do routinely here is so alien from the rest of the country.
[03:54:18.749 --> 03:54:19.789]  And I travel a lot.
[03:54:20.329 --> 03:54:22.870]  I traveled over 40 times in Europe.
[03:54:23.130 --> 03:54:26.852]  I've been all over Asia and all over the world.
[03:54:26.892 --> 03:54:28.753]  That's me in a cabin.
[03:54:29.213 --> 03:54:30.714]  The cabin was built in 1898.
[03:54:32.490 --> 03:54:34.431]  The Stope, not too long after.
[03:54:34.451 --> 03:54:55.784]  And, you know, when you think about the drop back in time and then jumping into a European capital or dropping into Austin and different places that I see routinely in the world, that's me underground, you know, and you know, a lot of people don't have those experiences.
[03:54:55.984 --> 03:54:56.344]  And yet,
[03:54:57.248 --> 03:55:07.734]  The parks I was mentioning covered and blocked out from the public domain some of the biggest mineral belts in the world actually.
[03:55:07.774 --> 03:55:12.978]  Some of the biggest mineral potentials in the country were locked up in parks and preserves.
[03:55:13.598 --> 03:55:20.062]  That's me in my upper valley marking survey markers on that stone or chiseled survey marker.
[03:55:21.087 --> 03:55:29.956]  You know, when you think about all of this and what happened in Alaska, and I'll tell you why it shut down.
[03:55:30.117 --> 03:55:33.781]  It happened, this place was screaming right up until World War II.
[03:55:34.733 --> 03:55:49.780]  And World War II happened, and they made non-strategic metals non-priority, so you couldn't get fuel or rubber or materials or anything during the war, and the entire gold mining industry and silver industry in the U.S.
[03:55:49.880 --> 03:55:50.541]  collapsed.
[03:55:51.681 --> 03:56:05.669]  The mining industry here collapsed because there weren't any industrial metals being mined at the time because Kennecott had already pulled out and even removed their track so no one would develop the minerals that were left behind.
[03:56:05.709 --> 03:56:10.312]  They literally removed the track and took it to Latin America and built the
[03:56:11.412 --> 03:56:12.032]  We're good to go.
[03:56:12.092 --> 03:56:12.572]  We're good to go.
[03:56:12.592 --> 03:56:13.533]  We're good to go.
[03:56:13.573 --> 03:56:14.933]  We're good to go.
[03:56:14.993 --> 03:56:15.713]  We're good to go.
[03:56:15.753 --> 03:56:16.153]  We're good to go.
[03:56:16.173 --> 03:56:16.574]  We're good to go.
[03:56:16.614 --> 03:56:17.494]  We're good to go.
[03:56:17.514 --> 03:56:18.554]  We're good to go.
[03:56:18.594 --> 03:56:19.634]  We're good to go.
[03:56:19.694 --> 03:56:20.115]  We're good to go.
[03:56:20.135 --> 03:56:20.555]  We're good to go.
[03:56:20.575 --> 03:56:21.035]  We're good to go.
[03:56:21.055 --> 03:56:21.735]  We're good to go.
[03:56:21.755 --> 03:56:22.715]  We're good to go.
[03:56:22.775 --> 03:56:23.315]  We're good to go.
[03:56:23.335 --> 03:56:23.916]  We're good to go.
[03:56:23.936 --> 03:56:24.256]  We're good to go.
[03:56:24.276 --> 03:56:24.876]  We're good to go.
[03:56:24.896 --> 03:56:26.296]  We're good to go.
[03:56:26.356 --> 03:56:27.076]  We're good to go.
[03:56:27.096 --> 03:56:28.397]  We're good to go.
[03:56:28.417 --> 03:56:29.437]  We're good to go.
[03:56:29.477 --> 03:56:30.297]  We're good to go.
[03:56:30.317 --> 03:56:30.957]  We're good to go.
[03:56:31.378 --> 03:56:31.818]  We're good to go.
[03:56:31.878 --> 03:56:32.738]  We're good to go.
[03:56:32.778 --> 03:56:33.978]  We're good to go.
[03:56:34.038 --> 03:56:34.659]  We're good to go.
[03:56:34.819 --> 03:56:35.259]  We're good to go.
[03:56:35.279 --> 03:56:35.799]  We're good to go.
[03:56:35.819 --> 03:56:36.539]  We're good to go.
[03:56:36.559 --> 03:56:37.319]  We're good to go.
[03:56:37.379 --> 03:56:37.819]  We're good to go.
[03:56:37.839 --> 03:56:38.520]  We're good to go.
[03:56:38.640 --> 03:56:39.320]  We're good to go.
[03:56:39.460 --> 03:56:39.940]  We're good to go.
[03:56:39.960 --> 03:56:40.060]  We're
[03:56:41.058 --> 03:56:48.822]  You know, in Alaska, when you think about, again, sort of what happened, World War II, everything stopped.
[03:56:49.002 --> 03:56:59.366]  It was like someone stuck a wrench in your bicycle spokes, headed down the hill at 80 miles an hour, you know, and everything just came to a screeching halt.
[03:56:59.446 --> 03:57:01.347]  Everything was left and people just left.
[03:57:02.616 --> 03:57:06.477]  And what happened after the war, inflation like tripled.
[03:57:06.857 --> 03:57:10.558]  And gold, if you remember, and silver were pretty much fixed at their prices.
[03:57:11.119 --> 03:57:13.159]  So you couldn't reopen these mines.
[03:57:13.659 --> 03:57:16.060]  And there was no infrastructure, no roads.
[03:57:16.500 --> 03:57:18.281]  In the old days, you had to have rail.
[03:57:18.401 --> 03:57:19.501]  You couldn't do it with trucks.
[03:57:19.541 --> 03:57:22.762]  Trucks were only haul a half a ton when trucks were invented.
[03:57:22.782 --> 03:57:25.663]  You know, you're looking at the
[03:57:27.270 --> 03:57:35.437]  One of the mines in Alaska that was shut down at the war, and it was a gold mine in Palmer, Alaska, near Palmer, Alaska.
[03:57:35.677 --> 03:57:37.699]  And, you know, again, it's unfortunate.
[03:57:37.739 --> 03:57:38.900]  Some of these are being reopened.
[03:57:38.920 --> 03:57:40.882]  This one on the backside is being reopened.
[03:57:42.223 --> 03:57:44.285]  We're going to see big changes in Alaska.
[03:57:44.305 --> 03:57:45.826]  A lot of resource development here.
[03:57:45.886 --> 03:57:47.928]  I'm going to talk about that, I guess.
[03:57:48.489 --> 03:57:50.751]  We're going to have to do it, and the next time I'm with you.
[03:57:51.131 --> 03:57:52.092]  This has been Nick Begich.
[03:58:02.244 --> 03:58:12.608]  Now, normally, when I drink Turbo Force, I usually like to drink it before the war room, and I get a kick, and then it sustains me through the rest of the night.
[03:58:12.628 --> 03:58:13.909]  I get to work out in it and everything.
[03:58:14.469 --> 03:58:18.331]  And I usually just pound it down and chase it with some Brain Force Plus.
[03:58:18.411 --> 03:58:26.834]  But Will Johnson, who's hosting the fourth hour, has made a suggestion before to me, and that is to drink it with hot water like you would sip on tea.
[03:58:27.134 --> 03:58:30.176]  So that's actually what I'm going to do today.
[03:58:30.996 --> 03:58:31.916]  On the Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:31.936 --> 03:58:39.418]  So let me just empty my packet of TurboForce into my InfoWars tumbler, which you can also get at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:58:39.478 --> 03:58:41.359]  Go ahead and knock that out.
[03:58:41.419 --> 03:58:42.259]  Go ahead and stir that in.
[03:58:42.279 --> 03:58:43.860]  I've got pretty hot water here.
[03:58:43.900 --> 03:58:47.981]  It's been sitting for a minute, so I should be able to drink this without it having to wait too long.
[03:58:48.001 --> 03:58:49.601]  I kind of feel like I'm doing an infomercial.
[03:58:49.761 --> 03:58:53.542]  Me stirring a cup of TurboForce has never looked so good.
[03:58:53.882 --> 03:58:54.663]  Oh my gosh.
[03:58:54.763 --> 03:58:57.143]  We're about to sell out of TurboForce with this one, folks.
[03:58:57.163 --> 03:58:59.304]  So you better go to InfoWarsStore.com immediately.
[03:58:59.364 --> 03:58:59.624]  All right.
