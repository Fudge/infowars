[00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.600]  It's Tuesday, April 23rd, 2019.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.003]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:32.224 --> 00:00:34.385]  I'm Owen Schroer, sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:39.948]  We will be hearing from Alex today in the first hour, at least.
[00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.732]  And I have so much news on my desk right now, I don't even have any room for more news.
[00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:51.354]  I had more news come on my desk and I looked for space to put it.
[00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:51.915]  There's none.
[00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:54.339]  So we'll try to get to all the news.
[00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.523]  A lot of news that's illustrative of where we're at right now as a culture, as a country.
[00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:08.808]  But first, let's go to the latest story from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:12.151]  You've seen Drag Queen Story Hour.
[00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:14.853]  Maybe you've wondered what you can do to combat it.
[00:01:15.353 --> 00:01:17.795]  Well, why not fight fire with fire?
[00:01:18.276 --> 00:01:24.961]  Some individuals decided to protest the Drag Queen Story Hour by dressing up as clowns themselves.
[00:01:26.102 --> 00:01:26.983]  Let's turn around.
[00:01:28.444 --> 00:01:29.024]  And shake your butt!
[00:01:33.763 --> 00:01:33.803]  3Lz !
[00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:33.883]  5.90 (-1.33!)
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:22.351]  So, that is from the American Identity Movement, and I guess the full video can be found on their website or their YouTube channel, but I'm just getting this video right now, so, I mean, I'll put it out there.
[00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:24.332]  We want to get these guys on.
[00:02:25.073 --> 00:02:30.657]  So, if the American Identity Movement is listening right now, we'd love to have you on as a guest.
[00:02:30.857 --> 00:02:32.839]  We think that you did a great job here.
[00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:34.260]  You know, and look,
[00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:43.238]  This is kind of an old-fashioned, new form of protest that's like trolling?
[00:02:44.195 --> 00:02:47.237]  But that's the only way to really get through to these people.
[00:02:47.597 --> 00:02:59.505]  See, they've gone so insane to the point where they're bringing men dressed as women to shake their butts and have children come sit on their laps, and much worse, I won't get into it, you've seen the videos.
[00:03:00.026 --> 00:03:03.108]  So that's what they do, that's the level of insanity that they've reached.
[00:03:03.548 --> 00:03:08.512]  We don't really know how to combat that, so we have to even go to their level of insanity.
[00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.630]  And dress up like a clown to raise awareness.
[00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.591]  Or dress up like a cow and go out to a Beto rally.
[00:03:14.931 --> 00:03:17.132]  But who would be crazy enough to do something like that?
[00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:21.454]  But so this is the American Identity Movement.
[00:03:22.554 --> 00:03:25.635]  The story from Paul Joseph Watson is at InfoWars.com.
[00:03:26.195 --> 00:03:28.076]  Activists dressed as clowns.
[00:03:28.156 --> 00:03:28.976]  Pull it back up guys.
[00:03:29.677 --> 00:03:35.699]  Activists dressed as clowns protest Drag Queen Story Hour.
[00:03:37.864 --> 00:03:42.165]  And look, if you've never heard of this, you probably say, well, what's Drag Queen Story Hour?
[00:03:44.426 --> 00:03:45.767]  That's exactly what it sounds like.
[00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:51.949]  They bring in drag queens to public libraries and schools and such to read to your children.
[00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:53.889]  It's Drag Queen Story Hour.
[00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:55.350]  It's progressive.
[00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.992]  And the mainstream news says, of course, we got to start them young, whatever the hell that means.
[00:04:04.278 --> 00:04:07.939]  And so yeah, this is what's going on right now in our society.
[00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.541]  And it's just, again, it's just total mental degeneration.
[00:04:15.801 --> 00:04:20.103]  And look, I got no problem with you if you like dressing up like a girl, okay?
[00:04:20.263 --> 00:04:21.543]  The last president married one of you.
[00:04:22.123 --> 00:04:23.163]  So it's not a big deal.
[00:04:23.744 --> 00:04:27.665]  I'm just saying, why do you have Drag Queen Story Hour for kids?
[00:04:28.885 --> 00:04:29.625]  What is up with that?
[00:04:29.805 --> 00:04:30.666]  And then what happens?
[00:04:31.366 --> 00:04:32.126]  You find out
[00:04:33.621 --> 00:04:37.443]  In one of these groups alone, there are multiple pedophiles.
[00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:41.666]  Which I actually think is sad for somebody that... For real!
[00:04:41.866 --> 00:04:42.086]  For real!
[00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:42.766]  I'm not even joking!
[00:04:43.046 --> 00:04:50.571]  For somebody that actually just is a drag queen and wants to dress up like a girl and they're into that, these pedophiles are actually giving them a bad name!
[00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:52.832]  So you better watch out!
[00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:58.155]  Yeah, pedophiles are dressing like clowns so they can get their hands on your kids!
[00:04:58.855 --> 00:05:01.377]  That's what Drag Queen Story Hour has been exploited as!
[00:05:03.925 --> 00:05:07.089]  Brain Force Plus is a top-tier nootropic.
[00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:08.311]  Focus.
[00:05:09.052 --> 00:05:09.593]  Clarity.
[00:05:10.033 --> 00:05:10.354]  Energy.

[00:05:25.868 --> 00:05:29.749]  It's not very profitable because we give it at such a low price, but it's amazing.
[00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.310]  And that, of course, is Knockout, the ultimate sleep aid.

[00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:19.816]  290 plus Christians were blown limb from limb in Sri Lanka at three Catholic churches and at luxury hotels while celebrating Easter Sunday.
[00:06:20.817 --> 00:06:33.106]  And for the first day, the media covered up the fact that ISIS had taken responsibility, that the perpetrators had shot videos and posted them online, saying what they were going to do and encouraging others to do it.
[00:06:33.906 --> 00:06:41.029]  No, the corporate media, always refusing to let anybody raise the alarm, said they didn't know who did it.
[00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:43.250]  No, there was no telling.
[00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:54.414]  And then, of course, as soon as it was forced out into the open, the next day, Monday, suddenly the Washington Post and the BBC and all the usual suspects
[00:06:55.074 --> 00:06:58.675]  came out and said, we're worried about Muslims.
[00:06:58.715 --> 00:06:59.915]  They're scared now.
[00:07:00.515 --> 00:07:04.756]  They're scared people might be mean to them and they're the victims.
[00:07:05.196 --> 00:07:07.436]  But none of them would say the word Christians.
[00:07:08.216 --> 00:07:09.756]  No, it was Easter worshippers.
[00:07:10.217 --> 00:07:21.639]  So the dehumanization of Christians is so complete in the globalist corporate media that they won't even say the word Christian in 99% of their reportage.
[00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:23.959]  And they do it in a concerted effort
[00:07:24.859 --> 00:07:26.040]  All over the world.
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.242]  Why is there this agenda to target Christians?
[00:07:30.642 --> 00:07:34.183]  Why are Christians the vast majority of persecuted people on the planet?
[00:07:34.523 --> 00:07:38.745]  Tucker Carlson filed a very powerful report last night laying this out.
[00:07:38.905 --> 00:07:40.246]  We're going to play it here in a moment.
[00:07:40.266 --> 00:07:51.911]  And then when I come back, I'm going to get into the bigger picture and why they are targeting Christians and targeting a couple other things like nations and borders and families.
[00:07:52.411 --> 00:07:53.252]  Here's Tucker Carlson.
[00:07:53.916 --> 00:07:55.998]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight.
[00:07:56.178 --> 00:08:01.103]  The holiest day of the Christian calendar turned to tragedy yesterday, as you know, in Sri Lanka.
[00:08:01.644 --> 00:08:08.410]  In a series of coordinated attacks, suicide bombers struck three Catholic churches as well as hotels in cities across the country.
[00:08:08.891 --> 00:08:10.752]  At least 290 people were murdered.
[00:08:10.993 --> 00:08:12.014]  Hundreds more were wounded.
[00:08:12.494 --> 00:08:16.098]  Sri Lankan authorities say the attackers were affiliated with a local terror group.
[00:08:16.658 --> 00:08:18.419]  The attackers were radical Muslims.
[00:08:18.739 --> 00:08:20.039]  Their motives were religious.
[00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:21.359]  Their targets were Christians.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.760]  None of that is speculation.
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.280]  It's true.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.242]  Maybe because it is so true, and so obviously true, nobody in authority wanted to say it out loud.
[00:08:29.262 --> 00:08:32.863]  So instead, they went to great lengths to avoid clear language.
[00:08:33.223 --> 00:08:39.585]  Quote, the attacks on tourists and Easter worshippers in Sri Lanka are an attack on humanity, tweeted Barack Obama.
[00:08:40.185 --> 00:08:41.746]  Hillary Clinton used the same awkward phrase.
[00:08:42.066 --> 00:08:48.111]  I'm praying for everyone affected by today's horrific attack on Easter worshipers and travelers in Sri Lanka, she wrote.
[00:08:48.991 --> 00:08:49.772]  Easter worshipers?
[00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:51.633]  Why don't you say Christians?
[00:08:51.933 --> 00:08:52.894]  Nobody worships Easter.
[00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:54.495]  There's a reason, of course.
[00:08:54.595 --> 00:08:56.257]  Euphemisms are never accidental.
[00:08:56.757 --> 00:08:58.919]  Our leaders believe Christians are the problem.
[00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:00.179]  They're the dangerous ones.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.560]  They can't be trusted.
[00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:07.645]  Tell them the truth and they might go crazy and organize a new crusade and sheath their swords and march on Jerusalem.
[00:09:07.725 --> 00:09:08.926]  You never know with Christians.
[00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:16.900]  Just tonight, the Washington Post ran a story with this headline, quote, Sri Lanka church bombing stoke far-right anger in West.
[00:09:17.833 --> 00:09:21.076]  As if you'd have to be some kind of Nazi to be upset about church bombings.
[00:09:21.316 --> 00:09:22.217]  That's what they seem to think.
[00:09:22.837 --> 00:09:26.420]  That's why our leaders consistently ignore the persecution of Christians around the world.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.301]  When U.S.
[00:09:27.341 --> 00:09:31.544]  policy contributes to that persecution, and it does, they say nothing about it.
[00:09:32.044 --> 00:09:39.190]  For example, less than 20 years after we overthrew Saddam Hussein, three quarters of Iraq's once thriving Christian population is gone.
[00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:44.875]  They've either been murdered by Islamic extremists, ISIS in some cases, or they've been driven out of the country as refugees.
[00:09:45.535 --> 00:09:49.918]  In Syria, Christians live for generations under the protection of the Assad family.
[00:09:50.218 --> 00:09:54.141]  You're not allowed to say that anymore or even know it, but it doesn't make it any less true.
[00:09:54.201 --> 00:09:54.741]  It is true.
[00:09:55.162 --> 00:09:59.024]  And you can talk to the hundreds of thousands of Christians who fled the country since the U.S.
[00:09:59.044 --> 00:10:02.247]  began supporting the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad if you want to know details.
[00:10:02.867 --> 00:10:05.408]  But no one in the American media ever asks their opinion.
[00:10:05.888 --> 00:10:06.589]  Nobody cares.
[00:10:07.129 --> 00:10:11.151]  Nobody cares that so many of our allies in the Middle East, countries that receive billions in U.S.
[00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:13.672]  tax dollars every year, repress Christianity.
[00:10:13.992 --> 00:10:17.474]  Afghanistan, for example, receives billions from us every year.
[00:10:17.694 --> 00:10:18.094]  Why?
[00:10:18.114 --> 00:10:19.295]  So we can turn it into Belgium.
[00:10:20.674 --> 00:10:25.917]  But right now in Afghanistan, converting to Christianity carries a death sentence if you're a Muslim.
[00:10:26.297 --> 00:10:30.740]  The same is true in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, both countries backed by the United States.
[00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:38.325]  In Egypt, conversion is legally restricted, and while it doesn't carry a death sentence, polls show that most of the public in Egypt wishes it did.
[00:10:39.646 --> 00:10:40.967]  So where's our State Department in all this?
[00:10:40.987 --> 00:10:46.150]  Our State Department spends a lot of time looking out for the human rights of people in countries you can't pronounce.
[00:10:47.073 --> 00:10:47.533]  They ignore it.
[00:10:47.953 --> 00:10:51.734]  When was the last time the United States pushed another country to treat Christians better?
[00:10:52.675 --> 00:10:54.335]  Well, in some cases it would be pretty easy to do that.
[00:10:54.355 --> 00:11:02.497]  We could just demand that Saudi Arabia or Pakistan or Afghanistan, countries that are dependent on us, implement full freedom of religion before we give them any more U.S.
[00:11:02.597 --> 00:11:02.757]  aid.
[00:11:03.358 --> 00:11:04.298]  Why wouldn't we do that?
[00:11:04.977 --> 00:11:08.878]  Because we're being afraid of being criticized by the nihilists at the Washington Post?
[00:11:22.822 --> 00:11:24.302]  Infowars.com.
[00:11:25.002 --> 00:11:26.583]  And that deals with the Washington Post and others.
[00:11:26.863 --> 00:11:28.123]  Here's the BBC today.
[00:11:28.663 --> 00:11:36.764]  BBC frets over, quote, nervous and afraid Muslims following Islamic terror attacks in Sri Lanka.
[00:11:37.265 --> 00:11:40.305]  Why are Christians being targeted?
[00:11:40.965 --> 00:11:43.166]  Well, because we know it's a spiritual war.
[00:11:44.066 --> 00:11:50.187]  And Christians aren't going to go along in the final equation with the transhumanism, the merging humans and animals.
[00:11:51.047 --> 00:11:52.808]  The microchips to buy and sell.
[00:11:53.788 --> 00:11:59.611]  The digital AI god that we're all supposed to worship that Elon Musk has warned us about.
[00:12:00.111 --> 00:12:03.533]  If you just look at leftists in general, they want to be worshipped.
[00:12:03.573 --> 00:12:04.673]  They want to control the language.
[00:12:04.973 --> 00:12:06.474]  They want to be the high priest of control.
[00:12:07.134 --> 00:12:12.456]  And they don't like groups or organizations that historically buck their centralized control.
[00:12:12.837 --> 00:12:17.919]  They don't like people like Christians that stand up against leftist bullies like the governors and
[00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:26.769]  New York and Virginia and North Carolina and California that are openly passing or trying to pass bills to kill babies after they're born.
[00:12:27.209 --> 00:12:30.874]  The left is diametrically opposed to Christians.
[00:12:31.174 --> 00:12:37.942]  And when you go out and face them in the streets, you find that not a minority, but a majority of them
[00:12:39.003 --> 00:12:44.610]  ...are foaming at the mouth and exhibiting signs classically associated with demon possession.
[00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:52.059]  They could cast many of them to star in the new Linda Blair production of The Exorcist.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.502]  And many times they tell you they love Satan.
[00:12:55.243 --> 00:12:57.805]  They love the devil, and they want to kill and hurt babies.
[00:12:58.365 --> 00:13:01.347]  And you can say, oh, they're just trying to shock you because they know you're a Christian.
[00:13:01.707 --> 00:13:05.970]  No, ladies and gentlemen, if you experience it and see it for yourself, this is a spirit.
[00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.953]  I have seen dozens of women spontaneously wearing their business suits.
[00:13:11.753 --> 00:13:12.934]  And Dress Nice to the Capitol.
[00:13:13.355 --> 00:13:24.867]  See a group of pro-lifers praying in the rotunda and begin chanting back at the Christians, Hail Satan, Hail Satan, and sticking their tongues out and licking their lips.
[00:13:26.101 --> 00:13:30.664]  I've witnessed this over and over again spontaneously.
[00:13:30.744 --> 00:13:40.370]  Women that don't even know each other joining together in a spiritual sacrament of killing children, of worshipping the death and the blood and the pain.
[00:13:40.971 --> 00:13:45.954]  This is a real spirit and abortion when it's consciously carried out by people that
[00:13:46.614 --> 00:13:51.417]  No, what's really happening is the manifestation of Satanism on this planet.
[00:13:51.558 --> 00:13:53.259]  It is the star in the crown.
[00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:55.500]  It is the open destruction of human life.
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.303]  And now they're segwaying the children even after they're born.
[00:13:59.723 --> 00:14:07.388]  This is all in your face and then sterilizing people and controlling people and adding chemicals to the vaccines that cause brain damage.
[00:14:07.408 --> 00:14:11.951]  This is all part of the soft kill now moving into hard kill.
[00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:14.473]  But what else are the globalists attacking?
[00:14:14.773 --> 00:14:15.794]  It's not just Christianity.
[00:14:16.414 --> 00:14:17.754]  They're attacking nation states.
[00:14:18.334 --> 00:14:19.395]  They're attacking the family.
[00:14:19.675 --> 00:14:20.755]  They're attacking borders.
[00:14:21.175 --> 00:14:27.276]  They're attacking anything that is independent and historically strong that is natural and that is normal.
[00:14:27.596 --> 00:14:39.979]  And right now we have Mexican troops routinely coming across the border, helping the drug dealers come across, routinely pointing guns at our military, routinely shooting at Border Patrol, and now disarming U.S.
[00:14:39.999 --> 00:14:41.139]  military on the U.S.
[00:14:41.179 --> 00:14:41.779]  side of the border.
[00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:44.921]  They can't control their own border because they're a bunch of narcotics traffickers.
[00:14:45.281 --> 00:14:47.343]  They are the cartel, especially the Mexican Army.
[00:14:47.543 --> 00:14:56.631]  But now more and more that we're trying to control that border and stop the drugs they're bringing across, they are openly detaining and disarming our military, and nothing's being done about it.
[00:14:56.871 --> 00:15:09.040]  In fact, the pliant FBI, still infested with leftists, goes down and tries to find anybody from the citizen militias that are simply there videotaping and documenting what's happening and arrest them.
[00:15:10.021 --> 00:15:23.153]  And the state of New Mexico that orders the Citizen Journalist slash militia out of the area, even though they've done a great job, and violates their rights, oh, but doesn't follow the Constitution and actually stop the hordes of illegal aliens.
[00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:26.436]  They've all been given a giant red carpet.
[00:15:26.596 --> 00:15:28.558]  This is all part of the takedown of the West.
[00:15:28.778 --> 00:15:30.160]  Christianity made us successful.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.100]  It made us rich.
[00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:31.921]  Thank you.
[00:16:04.474 --> 00:16:11.218]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[00:16:11.238 --> 00:16:14.400]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.682]  But I'll tell you like it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[00:16:19.222 --> 00:16:20.183]  You're our only sponsors.
[00:16:20.703 --> 00:16:26.726]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[00:16:27.187 --> 00:16:29.108]  So remember, you are the InfoWarp.
[00:16:29.668 --> 00:16:30.369]  I'm not the leader.
[00:16:30.669 --> 00:16:31.270]  You are the leader.
[00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.072]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[00:16:33.453 --> 00:16:38.198]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWareStore.com that are unprecedented.
[00:16:38.879 --> 00:16:46.328]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[00:16:46.348 --> 00:16:47.650]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:48.911]  I want to encourage you again.
[00:16:49.412 --> 00:16:54.098]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[00:16:54.338 --> 00:16:57.102]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[00:16:57.503 --> 00:16:59.385]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[00:16:59.625 --> 00:17:00.066]  God bless you.
[00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:11.280]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[00:17:11.701 --> 00:17:13.521]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[00:17:13.621 --> 00:17:14.321]  Good to talk to you.
[00:17:14.662 --> 00:17:18.843]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[00:17:19.063 --> 00:17:20.804]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[00:17:20.904 --> 00:17:25.285]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[00:17:25.505 --> 00:17:27.406]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[00:17:27.486 --> 00:17:31.827]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate that.
[00:17:31.907 --> 00:17:33.388]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:33.908]  Tell us about it.
[00:17:33.988 --> 00:17:34.688]  Well, it's really great.
[00:17:34.708 --> 00:17:35.908]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[00:17:35.948 --> 00:17:36.389]  I take it.
[00:17:36.449 --> 00:17:37.069]  It tastes good.
[00:17:37.129 --> 00:17:38.829]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[00:17:38.889 --> 00:17:40.589]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[00:17:40.729 --> 00:17:43.210]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:44.030]  So I really like it.
[00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:46.731]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[00:17:46.771 --> 00:17:48.311]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[00:17:48.431 --> 00:17:50.292]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[00:17:50.412 --> 00:17:50.892]  So, yeah.
[00:17:51.272 --> 00:17:53.132]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[00:17:53.592 --> 00:17:55.913]  These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force.
[00:17:56.273 --> 00:17:57.173]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[00:17:57.353 --> 00:17:59.093]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:18:03.462 --> 00:18:04.783]  I've got a big announcement to make.
[00:18:05.143 --> 00:18:12.506]  We've got four or five positions in IT and a bunch of very exciting projects we want to launch.
[00:18:13.046 --> 00:18:22.531]  If you see things going on in InfoWars that you want to make better, and if you want to really be involved in the heart of the fight against the globalist, send your resumes.
[00:18:23.451 --> 00:18:27.695]  Put the confidential in private to techjobsatinfowars.com.
[00:18:28.496 --> 00:18:33.140]  Again, we've got four or five places we want to fill and a lot of new secret projects going on.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:41.747]  The point is, if you want to build freedom in this country and promote free speech and you want to help InfoWars go to the next level, we want to hire you.
[00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:43.509]  Send your resumes to techjobs.com.
[00:18:43.969 --> 00:18:46.770]  I want to say BrainForce is great.
[00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:47.771]  I want to say TurboForce is amazing.
[00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:47.891]  It is!
[00:18:48.191 --> 00:18:49.231]  But if you took it with fish oil...
[00:19:11.193 --> 00:19:12.754]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[00:19:13.214 --> 00:19:14.494]  The fish oil is better than it.
[00:19:14.554 --> 00:19:16.315]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:19:16.375 --> 00:19:18.716]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:19:18.876 --> 00:19:20.417]  Brain, body, heart.
[00:19:20.497 --> 00:19:21.897]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[00:19:21.957 --> 00:19:23.178]  You've got the children's.
[00:19:23.338 --> 00:19:24.298]  You've got the adults.
[00:19:24.458 --> 00:19:25.359]  You've got the krill oil.
[00:19:25.459 --> 00:19:28.800]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.981]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[00:19:31.041 --> 00:19:32.623]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[00:19:32.763 --> 00:19:33.443]  And I'm just sorry.
[00:19:33.544 --> 00:19:34.545]  You want something like this?
[00:19:34.625 --> 00:19:35.485]  You don't get stuff for free.
[00:19:35.586 --> 00:19:37.467]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:19:37.527 --> 00:19:38.008]  It's so good.
[00:19:38.028 --> 00:19:38.649]  In my view.
[00:19:38.749 --> 00:19:40.931]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[00:19:41.071 --> 00:19:43.674]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[00:19:43.774 --> 00:19:45.415]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:19:47.157 --> 00:19:51.722]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:19:54.676 --> 00:20:00.485]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:20:00.705 --> 00:20:01.487]  I just can't do it!
[00:20:06.594 --> 00:20:09.198]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:27.879 --> 00:20:32.021]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:20:32.762 --> 00:20:34.283]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:34.863 --> 00:20:37.584]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:20:38.465 --> 00:20:53.133]  You know, I think everybody, at some point in their life, has a Black Bill moment.
[00:20:54.099 --> 00:21:06.569]  Where they look at humanity and where we're going and they just say this is not right, where did we go wrong, this is not our destiny, this is not what we're meant to be.
[00:21:06.589 --> 00:21:14.655]  A lot of times this happens when you're a child even.
[00:21:16.428 --> 00:21:19.150]  But then, those instincts get beaten out of you.
[00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:21.152]  They get beaten out of you with the world.
[00:21:21.853 --> 00:21:23.454]  They get beaten out of you with the propaganda.
[00:21:23.854 --> 00:21:27.878]  And then by the time you're out of college, well, humans weren't even created!
[00:21:28.618 --> 00:21:29.839]  We're basically pond scum!
[00:21:29.899 --> 00:21:31.000]  So, doesn't matter.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.061]  By the way, we're killing the Earth!
[00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:32.782]  We're parasites!
[00:21:33.482 --> 00:21:34.403]  So just die!
[00:21:38.226 --> 00:21:43.491]  And... We're about to go to a clip that highlights part of this sickness.
[00:21:44.858 --> 00:21:51.160]  Which is Drag Queen Story Hour, where they bring drag queens to public libraries and such to read to your kids.
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:58.641]  And then they read to your kids, they do dances, they tell them to shake their butts, they have them touch their beards, they have them bouncing up and down on their laps.
[00:21:59.122 --> 00:22:01.202]  They're basically dressed like male strippers.
[00:22:01.762 --> 00:22:03.723]  Even, in fact, worse, quite frankly.
[00:22:04.443 --> 00:22:06.904]  Male strippers don't even dress the way some of these drag queens do.
[00:22:08.524 --> 00:22:12.325]  And so the American Identity Movement did a brilliant protest, really.
[00:22:13.945 --> 00:22:18.369]  Dressing up like clowns and saying, you know, this is Drag Queen Story Hour, adult entertainment for kids.
[00:22:18.389 --> 00:22:19.069]  We're part of the fun.
[00:22:19.189 --> 00:22:20.050]  We're drag queens, too.
[00:22:20.511 --> 00:22:39.927]  Anybody can be a drag queen, but... I came up with an analogy in my head for where humanity is at right now, because... I mean, even... Being rational... I mean, I have to accept certain realities.
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.781]  I mean, I know where humanity is going.
[00:22:43.662 --> 00:22:44.923]  I'm not gonna be microchipped.
[00:22:45.483 --> 00:22:46.885]  You bet your bottom dollar on that.
[00:22:48.286 --> 00:22:52.769]  But, in not too long, everybody's gonna be microchipped.
[00:22:55.372 --> 00:23:09.023]  And that's when the real quickening happens, and the AI gets rolled out, and then you have mega cities, mega metros taking over everything, and there'll be certain land
[00:23:10.484 --> 00:23:13.425]  Designated for actual Earth, but you'll never see it.
[00:23:14.885 --> 00:23:19.246]  You'll be in the megacity where all the traffic is and everybody's at and all the disease and everything, getting all your vaccines.
[00:23:20.366 --> 00:23:21.126]  That's gonna happen!
[00:23:21.806 --> 00:23:22.407]  That's inevitable.
[00:23:22.527 --> 00:23:23.287]  It's all biblical.
[00:23:23.567 --> 00:23:24.327]  It's where we're going.
[00:23:24.547 --> 00:23:28.388]  And then, you know, God and Jesus will come in and do their thing and wipe it all out.
[00:23:29.508 --> 00:23:30.688]  Just like it's happened before.
[00:23:33.089 --> 00:23:34.049]  But here's the analogy.
[00:23:36.696 --> 00:23:42.721]  Even though I have to take the black pill and realize that that's eventually where we're going.
[00:23:43.022 --> 00:23:44.023]  I mean, just look at the trends.
[00:23:44.043 --> 00:23:45.384]  I mean, there's no way we're getting out of this.
[00:23:49.347 --> 00:23:53.431]  Even though that's where we're going, I don't want to experience it.
[00:23:53.871 --> 00:23:54.852]  It's like drowning.
[00:23:58.596 --> 00:23:58.756]  So...
[00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:02.432]  You don't want to drown, you're fighting for air!
[00:24:02.592 --> 00:24:03.892]  You're trying to get to the surface!
[00:24:04.052 --> 00:24:05.493]  You're trying to live as long as possible!
[00:24:06.273 --> 00:24:07.574]  It's a survival instinct.
[00:24:08.954 --> 00:24:12.596]  And you see, the devil is trying to drown humanity.
[00:24:13.156 --> 00:24:19.499]  And some of us are scratching and clawing to get some last air from the surface before we get drugged to the depths.
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.241]  And the problem we face is that
[00:24:25.054 --> 00:24:31.836]  Now we have fellow humans that are down beneath the surface pulling humanity down with the devil.
[00:24:33.057 --> 00:24:33.897]  And that's what we're fighting.
[00:24:34.958 --> 00:24:37.819]  And here is just one example of that.
[00:24:38.699 --> 00:24:50.423]  Where Drag Queen Story Time, coming to a library near you, coming to children near you, where just one Drag Queen Story Hour group in Houston alone had two pedophiles in it,
[00:24:53.513 --> 00:25:00.678]  The American Identity Movement protested them by dressing as clowns, and here is their video.
[00:25:01.578 --> 00:25:02.479]  Let's turn around.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:09.563]  And shake your butt!
[00:25:09.583 --> 00:25:15.567]  Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it!
[00:25:15.587 --> 00:25:16.308]  Williams, Louisiana.
[00:25:16.328 --> 00:25:17.649]  Drag queens and pedophiles.
[00:25:36.483 --> 00:25:37.885]  Now they're in the library.
[00:25:37.905 --> 00:25:41.428]  They roll out their clown outfits and their sign.
[00:25:41.588 --> 00:25:44.531]  Oh, and then they have to go because they don't want to touch your children.
[00:25:46.493 --> 00:25:47.995]  See, you're not a real drag queen.
[00:25:48.015 --> 00:25:49.376]  You're not here to play with kids.
[00:25:51.178 --> 00:25:52.079]  So you've got to go.
[00:25:53.401 --> 00:25:54.161]  Oh, you, sir!
[00:25:54.382 --> 00:25:55.042]  I mean, ma'am.
[00:25:56.424 --> 00:25:57.505]  You wanted to play with the kids?
[00:25:57.765 --> 00:25:58.326]  Come on in!
[00:26:06.377 --> 00:26:11.419]  Now, if you did that in London, your ass would probably be locked up.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.340]  Think about that.
[00:26:15.341 --> 00:26:16.322]  So this is what I'm talking about.
[00:26:16.362 --> 00:26:18.983]  This is the sickness, this is Satan, this is evil.
[00:26:20.664 --> 00:26:34.450]  And you know, no matter what religion you've studied or you are affiliated with, or even beyond religion, not even religion, ancient folklore,
[00:26:35.589 --> 00:26:39.732]  There's always one thing in common.
[00:26:39.852 --> 00:26:41.374]  The battle of good and evil.
[00:26:41.434 --> 00:26:43.896]  The spiritual battle of good and evil, folks.
[00:26:44.016 --> 00:26:44.956]  It's constant.
[00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:46.277]  It's infinite.
[00:26:47.358 --> 00:26:48.419]  It dominates this universe.
[00:26:51.341 --> 00:26:52.042]  It's the challenge.
[00:26:55.224 --> 00:26:57.066]  And I, look, I don't hate anybody.
[00:26:57.146 --> 00:26:57.867]  I don't judge anybody.
[00:26:58.867 --> 00:27:00.809]  I don't even, I mean, in fact,
[00:27:02.355 --> 00:27:08.257]  I've met many drag queens, cross-dressers, transsexuals that listen to InfoWars.
[00:27:08.437 --> 00:27:08.997]  They're fans.
[00:27:09.177 --> 00:27:10.157]  They like our politics.
[00:27:10.237 --> 00:27:11.178]  They have common sense.
[00:27:12.498 --> 00:27:12.958]  So what?
[00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:20.520]  Well, now they get drug into the same group as these people and I don't think they appreciate it much.
[00:27:23.081 --> 00:27:30.123]  Wait, you're telling me that pedophiles, to hide their identity,
[00:27:31.587 --> 00:27:35.108]  Dress up as drag queen clowns and drag queen demons?
[00:27:36.068 --> 00:27:36.609]  Shocking!
[00:27:37.169 --> 00:27:43.511]  Oh, you're telling me that now there's a drag queen story hour where they read to kids and they're infiltrating these groups?
[00:27:44.531 --> 00:27:44.831]  No.
[00:27:46.352 --> 00:27:52.674]  But you know... Really makes you wonder... Where it all started.
[00:27:53.534 --> 00:27:55.915]  Whose idea was it to have drag queen story hour?
[00:27:58.191 --> 00:28:03.234]  Because I have a weird feeling it wasn't Drag Queens.
[00:28:06.015 --> 00:28:06.195]  No.
[00:28:07.596 --> 00:28:08.196]  I don't think so.
[00:28:09.717 --> 00:28:12.759]  I don't think it was Drag Queens that wanted to start Drag Queens Story Hour, do you?
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:14.960]  No.
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.221]  I think there's something else going on there, folks.
[00:28:18.522 --> 00:28:20.243]  I think there's something sinister happening here.
[00:28:24.085 --> 00:28:24.385]  But hey.
[00:28:25.779 --> 00:28:35.785]  We're kicking and screaming to try to get the devil off of our legs as we're getting the last gasps of air before humanity gets totally pulled down.
[00:28:36.265 --> 00:28:38.627]  And we just want to salvage freedom and independence in the West.
[00:28:38.827 --> 00:28:46.812]  You know, we just want to salvage the last bastion of freedom and independence and love for God in the West that we can.
[00:28:46.832 --> 00:28:53.696]  I mean, is it too much to ask, can you devil worshipers, can you pawns of Satan just go somewhere else?
[00:28:53.756 --> 00:28:54.717]  Can you just go abort?
[00:28:55.245 --> 00:28:58.646]  Oh, oh, and then they say, oh, God doesn't have a side of politics.
[00:28:58.706 --> 00:28:58.986]  Really?
[00:28:59.046 --> 00:29:00.826]  God doesn't want to protect the unborn children?
[00:29:01.026 --> 00:29:01.647]  Give me a break.
[00:29:03.707 --> 00:29:10.649]  Let me just tell listeners about something that is the very best product for your telomeres, for your mitochondrial DNA.
[00:29:10.829 --> 00:29:12.589]  That's the antioxidant that's next level.
[00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:21.591]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, the amount of it in here, depending on the equation, something like 40 boxes of the same chemical that's naturally occurring in blueberries.
[00:29:21.771 --> 00:29:22.492]  It's ridiculous.
[00:29:22.612 --> 00:29:23.052]  The CoQ10, PPQ,
[00:29:24.292 --> 00:29:27.553]  We have the organically derived, and by that, it's not synthetic.
[00:29:27.813 --> 00:29:33.175]  Most of the stuff that you see on the shelves, a tiny bottle of PQQ or CoQ10, will be like 50 bucks, because even the synthetic's expensive.
[00:29:33.315 --> 00:29:35.415]  This is the organically derived.
[00:29:35.836 --> 00:29:36.736]  This is the real stuff.
[00:29:36.936 --> 00:29:48.359]  I want to warn you, though, when I first started taking it five years ago, this is DNA Force Plus, when I cut my finger off, like, 15 years ago, they reattached the finger, and you can see that right there, where it cut off, it was hanging by a piece of skin right here.
[00:29:48.379 --> 00:29:50.080]  It doesn't cut cleanly like you see in the movies.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:51.501]  Then tore it off.
[00:29:51.801 --> 00:29:53.242]  It was numb all the way up here.
[00:29:53.382 --> 00:29:55.523]  And the strangest thing is I started taking DNA force.
[00:29:55.723 --> 00:29:57.284]  The feeling came back in my finger.
[00:29:57.324 --> 00:29:58.825]  First it tingled, and it came back.
[00:29:59.005 --> 00:30:00.106]  I was like, this is incredible.
[00:30:00.146 --> 00:30:00.967]  But I'm going to warn you.
[00:30:01.167 --> 00:30:05.710]  Most people that have old injuries and where nerves have kind of died out, this isn't just regenerating your cells.
[00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.672]  This isn't just slowing the shrinkage of telomeres, which is the same thing as making them last longer.
[00:30:09.852 --> 00:30:12.174]  It really does regenerate nerves in many areas.
[00:30:12.394 --> 00:30:14.195]  So it's the building blocks.
[00:30:14.475 --> 00:30:15.376]  And it's the next level.
[00:30:15.416 --> 00:30:16.357]  It's the best you're going to get.
[00:30:16.497 --> 00:30:19.238]  I remember saying, what's the top selling thing like six years ago?
[00:30:19.278 --> 00:30:20.059]  We're getting into supplements.
[00:30:20.299 --> 00:30:22.141]  And well, it's PQQ and CoQ10.
[00:30:22.261 --> 00:30:27.467]  But mainly, people at grocery stores don't want to pay that, so they buy synthetic stuff that's still 50, 60 bucks for a little bottle.
[00:30:27.667 --> 00:30:32.213]  But at medical clinics, it's not prescription, but people are willing to pay, you know, 300, 400 bucks.
[00:30:32.533 --> 00:30:34.155]  That's a six, seven times markup.
[00:30:35.196 --> 00:30:35.916]  The good news is...
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:15.407]  After a year and a half long battle to secure the deep-earth crystals that nobody else has for the purest atomic iodine out there, we have been able to secure X2.
[00:31:16.107 --> 00:31:17.608]  I was sure we weren't going to be able to get it.
[00:31:17.968 --> 00:31:20.730]  It's a derivative that the oil companies get between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:32.358]  There's globalist industrial espionage that goes on where they try to not just take our sponsors and things, but actually stop us from getting the raw material because this is under DEA control to get the raw stuff because it's so powerful.
[00:31:32.918 --> 00:31:35.160]  So X2, after being sold out for several months,
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.442]  We were able to get it back into production from its original producer, and we now have it.
[00:31:40.822 --> 00:31:44.023]  And it is the purest, best, good halogen out there.
[00:31:44.463 --> 00:31:49.644]  Just research how IQs went down massively in the Midwest because they didn't have any iodine in the soil.
[00:31:50.045 --> 00:31:54.046]  Once the government added it, it just did all of these insanely good things.
[00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:54.866]  Research.
[00:31:55.546 --> 00:31:56.086]  It's incredible.
[00:31:56.347 --> 00:31:57.187]  One of God's great gifts.
[00:31:57.927 --> 00:31:58.787]  So, X2's back.
[00:31:58.908 --> 00:31:59.908]  It's in about a week and a half.
[00:31:59.948 --> 00:32:01.489]  You can pre-order at InfoWarshore.com.
[00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:03.110]  I almost forgot.
[00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:06.351]  25% off out of the gates to celebrate the fact that it's back.
[00:32:06.391 --> 00:32:08.893]  I forgot that part.
[00:32:08.913 --> 00:32:10.053]  25% off X2.
[00:32:10.453 --> 00:32:11.454]  A lot of you have experienced it.
[00:32:11.474 --> 00:32:11.954]  You've loved it.
[00:32:12.034 --> 00:32:12.674]  A lot of you haven't.
[00:32:13.055 --> 00:32:13.575]  Try it out.
[00:32:13.615 --> 00:32:14.315]  Fund the operation.
[00:32:14.936 --> 00:32:16.937]  The bad news is, outside of our audience...
[00:32:17.757 --> 00:32:24.302]  People don't know that Iodine is needed for electrochemical activity in the brain, or for your hormones, or for everything that happens in your body.
[00:32:24.682 --> 00:32:28.745]  And if you don't have it, you absorb the bad allergens like Chlorine and Fluoride and other things.
[00:32:29.625 --> 00:32:32.928]  So get your X2 original today and share it with people.
[00:32:33.348 --> 00:32:35.590]  Tell them about the Iodine conspiracy.
[00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:38.292]  Because the bad news is a lot of people don't know.
[00:32:38.312 --> 00:32:38.332]  X2.
[00:32:41.018 --> 00:32:43.839]  It's been sold out for months, but it's coming back in right now.
[00:32:43.879 --> 00:32:46.761]  Good news for folks that are on AutoShip and InfoWarshore.com.
[00:32:47.021 --> 00:32:49.822]  Sign up for AutoShip to make sure you get it every month, every two months, whatever you want.
[00:32:50.082 --> 00:32:54.464]  Cancel any time and you will get 10% off additionally, 25% off.
[00:32:54.864 --> 00:32:55.685]  X2's back!
[00:32:56.045 --> 00:32:58.806]  Now explain to people how critical iodine is.
[00:32:58.886 --> 00:33:01.147]  It's the opposite of fluoride.
[00:33:01.187 --> 00:33:01.887]  X2's back!
[00:33:06.569 --> 00:33:09.231]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:34.873]  17 years ago, back when South by Southwest in Austin was actually pretty cool.
[00:33:35.613 --> 00:33:39.876]  You could just basically buy tickets to any of the little sub film festivals that took place.
[00:33:41.337 --> 00:33:47.081]  And I saw that the maker of The Exorcist, the director,
[00:33:48.965 --> 00:34:03.071]  But he was also one of the main producers, was going to be in town, and he was going to be showing The Exorcist and a twin showing another film he made, The French Connection, about narcotics trafficking and intelligence agencies and things.
[00:34:03.811 --> 00:34:05.151]  That was another great film with Gene Hagman.
[00:34:05.612 --> 00:34:10.974]  So I bought my tickets, went, sat there, watched it, watched him come out and give a speech.
[00:34:11.814 --> 00:34:16.496]  And I knew about The Exorcist and how it had been partially a CIA
[00:34:17.978 --> 00:34:20.199]  We're good to go.
[00:34:37.802 --> 00:34:40.243]  Talked about some of those historic facts.
[00:34:40.723 --> 00:34:55.767]  And what made me think of this, that old story, and that happening, and that event, was I was surfing around on YouTube this morning, early this morning, on the elliptical, and I came across Joey Diaz and Joe Rogan talk about The Exorcist.
[00:34:55.967 --> 00:35:04.269]  And there was Joey Diaz talking about how there had never been a movie like that up until that point, how it was a directing masterpiece, and how it basically changed
[00:35:05.322 --> 00:35:07.202]  The Overton Window in society and culture.
[00:35:08.023 --> 00:35:16.485]  Next time I talk to Joey, he's a smart guy, but he probably doesn't even know that The Exorcist was basically produced by a group inside the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:35:17.885 --> 00:35:20.366]  That's even on the IMDB last time I checked.
[00:35:22.026 --> 00:35:29.268]  But think about how the CIA, or elements of it, in the 50s and 60s, financed ugly,
[00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:39.593]  Buildings and ugly literature and ugly art, and on purpose, would then force feed it to the public to change people's views about what was beauty.
[00:35:40.153 --> 00:35:41.393]  Why was that going on?
[00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:43.854]  Well, really it's a demoralization.
[00:35:44.534 --> 00:35:46.995]  The system wants you to give up on the family.
[00:35:47.815 --> 00:35:52.656]  It wants you to give up on the magic of women and how they can have a baby and then feed the baby and take care of it.
[00:35:52.676 --> 00:35:56.578]  I mean, just a whole new world, a whole system in and of themselves.
[00:35:58.988 --> 00:36:01.810]  They don't want you to realize our connection to God.
[00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:06.353]  They don't want you to see the inherent beauty in the universe.
[00:36:06.873 --> 00:36:24.444]  That's why all the studies show that just forest bathing, as the Japanese call it, but spending 30 minutes in the woods or out in the fields or stargazing is hundreds of times better than taking Prozac or some other type of mind-altering drug that our bodies need to work in the garden.
[00:36:25.485 --> 00:36:26.946]  That our bodies need to do housework.
[00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:32.071]  That we need to cook our own meals, that we need to process our own food.
[00:36:32.191 --> 00:36:44.933]  All the studies show this is what is fulfilling and we're being artificially taken out of what's healthy and what's good for us and what we're designed to be and put in this artificiality.
[00:36:45.273 --> 00:36:48.294]  And listen, I know everybody listening is like, yeah, Alex, tell us something we don't know.
[00:36:48.594 --> 00:36:53.835]  But it just has to hit everyone that this whole matrix is being built around us.
[00:36:55.362 --> 00:37:13.378]  This system, to cut us off from the real world, to cut us off from God, and to cut us off from our fellow human beings, is being built by social engineers who know they cannot capture free, open-thinking humans, but they can only rule the future and dominate and control by dumbing us down, by domesticating us.
[00:37:13.938 --> 00:37:20.484]  And again, everyone already knows this inherently, but every gauge, every measurement, every study shows
[00:37:21.747 --> 00:37:28.291]  Smartphones and their interfacing with so-called social media is making people more alone, more depressed.
[00:37:28.892 --> 00:37:31.654]  It's making them not have sexual relations.
[00:37:31.734 --> 00:37:38.818]  It's, it's, it's... The porn, all of it, is being deployed to dehumanize us.
[00:37:39.779 --> 00:37:43.021]  And I don't even attack it from a puritanical perspective.
[00:37:43.422 --> 00:37:45.643]  Like, you watch that boy, you'll go blind.
[00:37:46.424 --> 00:37:48.705]  I'm telling you from experience.
[00:37:48.985 --> 00:37:49.746]  When I was young,
[00:37:52.077 --> 00:37:52.698]  Promiscuous.
[00:37:53.618 --> 00:38:04.807]  At a certain point, it made it empty and not fun anymore because it was not with a woman I love or a woman I was committed to.
[00:38:05.928 --> 00:38:10.692]  And so for several years, I ended up basically being celibate.
[00:38:11.949 --> 00:38:16.611]  And it wasn't even a thought process back when I was about, I don't know, 20 years old.
[00:38:17.551 --> 00:38:28.216]  It was just that I got back into researching, back into history, back into intense exercise, back into, you know, not drinking, and just getting my head right with God.
[00:38:28.236 --> 00:38:34.219]  And then, of course, I basically sussed out my mission to take on the globalist.
[00:38:34.399 --> 00:38:37.880]  And that's what you're supposed to do around that age as a man.
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.321]  You know, really think about what you want to do.
[00:38:41.007 --> 00:38:43.848]  And look, I'm stating, again, a bunch of well-known facts here.
[00:38:44.248 --> 00:38:51.170]  It's just that when you really consciously realize that they're putting millions of young children now in Europe and the U.S.
[00:38:51.890 --> 00:39:05.734]  on hormone blockers that totally stunt their growth, change their physiology, are linked to cancer, and that children are being convinced by TV shows and school programs and their sick parents to be part of this,
[00:39:06.912 --> 00:39:08.433]  And it's all being sold as a choice.
[00:39:09.233 --> 00:39:27.319]  But the truth is, it's an evil, corrupt state, and evil, corrupt parents, or gullible parents, going through with something that is inherently directly out of Brave New World, and the actual eugenics plan of UNESCO, and again, Julian Huxley's brother.
[00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:30.330]  wrote the book.
[00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:34.592]  Aldous Huxley, but Julian Huxley actually ran the program.
[00:39:34.632 --> 00:39:36.993]  And when you see all this, you understand it's not our opinion.
[00:39:37.013 --> 00:39:39.034]  This is a diabolical program.
[00:39:40.335 --> 00:39:41.255]  This is an operation.
[00:39:41.656 --> 00:39:44.257]  There's another big piece to this that's important.
[00:39:45.818 --> 00:39:46.938]  And this is totally critical.
[00:39:48.259 --> 00:39:58.584]  The average person, by the time they're 15 years old, has seen tens of thousands of murders, assaults, and rapes
[00:39:59.714 --> 00:40:00.395]  Simulated.
[00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:04.838]  And now with the shoot-em-up video games, sometimes it's in the hundreds of thousands.
[00:40:05.959 --> 00:40:13.906]  And so people are habituated to basically be the equivalent, at a subconscious level, of battle-hardened soldiers.
[00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:20.192]  Where you've seen more death, more blood, more killing, your brain at a subconscious level is taking that in as real.
[00:40:20.392 --> 00:40:31.217]  But you're sitting there, overweight, like so many of us are, playing a video game, watching television, but at a subconscious level, you are basically suffering PTSD.
[00:40:31.857 --> 00:40:40.341]  And that's why aggression and depression and, again, all of these systems are so incredibly prolific now and expanding.
[00:40:41.277 --> 00:40:42.458]  Because we've been dehumanized.
[00:40:42.558 --> 00:40:46.783]  And, you know, my grandfather, my dad's dad, he would get up and leave.
[00:40:46.803 --> 00:40:48.605]  And he was a manly man.
[00:40:49.225 --> 00:40:53.970]  He would get up and leave movies that showed a bunch of blood coming out of people's mouths or stuff.
[00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:55.992]  Because he'd seen a lot of that in World War II that was real.
[00:40:56.012 --> 00:40:57.574]  And it wasn't that he couldn't handle it.
[00:40:58.134 --> 00:41:01.418]  It was that he thought it was making a joke out of things like that.
[00:41:02.711 --> 00:41:03.812]  And, you know, he was right.
[00:41:04.272 --> 00:41:07.054]  And again, people have a right to make those movies, they have a right to do those things.
[00:41:07.514 --> 00:41:10.476]  It's just that it does dehumanize us.
[00:41:10.616 --> 00:41:11.557]  Just like abortion.
[00:41:12.417 --> 00:41:16.060]  Just like now we're not even debating killing babies that are already born.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:20.122]  Now we're saying we're going to kill old people and it's happening.
[00:41:21.123 --> 00:41:22.083]  It's not a right to die.
[00:41:22.744 --> 00:41:24.945]  It's the right of the system to get rid of you because you cost too much.
[00:41:25.826 --> 00:41:27.607]  We're building a system that collapses.
[00:41:29.275 --> 00:41:35.020]  There's plenty of money for uneducated illegal aliens, but no money for grandma, no money for that newborn baby, because we're going to sell its organs.
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:36.401]  That's where all this has gone.
[00:41:36.461 --> 00:41:54.275]  So now we've all seen so many simulated murders, so much killing, that when a governor gets up on television and the radio and says, we keep babies alive after they're born, and it turns out they're harvesting their organs, people can't differentiate the real world, that real horror, beyond the exorcist.
[00:41:55.322 --> 00:41:57.963]  Because, again, our hearts have been hardened.
[00:41:58.523 --> 00:41:59.284]  We've been programmed.
[00:41:59.644 --> 00:42:00.864]  It's very, very dangerous.
[00:42:01.364 --> 00:42:03.485]  All right, back to the live broadcast with Owen Schroyer.
[00:42:04.025 --> 00:42:05.486]  Again, I'll be in the field in D.C.
[00:42:05.506 --> 00:42:07.347]  with live reports tonight and so much more.
[00:42:07.367 --> 00:42:08.327]  A lot of big news coming up.

[00:42:28.476 --> 00:42:31.938]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, when we come back from this break...
[00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:37.338]  We're going to break down a couple stories that have just come across my desk.
[00:42:37.398 --> 00:42:40.619]  You want to see what happens when Democrats take over your city?
[00:42:40.759 --> 00:42:42.720]  Just look at San Francisco.
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.780]  They're literally swimming in feces.
[00:42:45.321 --> 00:42:50.822]  And then we'll take a look at Bob Woodward, who has recently licked his finger to see which way the wind is blowing.
[00:42:51.142 --> 00:42:53.043]  And now he's supporting President Trump.
[00:42:53.323 --> 00:42:55.944]  Isn't that so convenient from Bob Woodward?
[00:42:56.404 --> 00:42:59.445]  All of that and more on the Alex Jones Show when we come back.
[00:43:03.976 --> 00:43:10.724]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.

[00:47:15.799 --> 00:47:21.904]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:47:22.384 --> 00:47:25.146]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:47:28.229 --> 00:47:35.995]  You know, I pitched to this segment out of the last break saying, we're gonna get into what happens when Democrats run your city.
[00:47:38.237 --> 00:47:40.639]  And of course it's the old story that everyone's heard.
[00:47:42.472 --> 00:47:45.675]  How in California the streets are covered in feces.
[00:47:46.736 --> 00:47:51.220]  In fact, it's so bad that they have poop maps now.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.281]  An annual poop map.
[00:47:52.321 --> 00:47:54.623]  They have to update it every year because it keeps getting worse and worse.
[00:47:54.663 --> 00:48:02.970]  So you know, give or take five years, probably like, you'll have like the bubonic plague breakout in California.
[00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:06.333]  Because of how disgusting
[00:48:08.092 --> 00:48:10.153]  The current status of their cities are.
[00:48:10.194 --> 00:48:17.058]  So the story here from Ben Gilbert on My San Antonio.
[00:48:17.899 --> 00:48:20.581]  People are pooping more than ever on the streets of San Francisco.
[00:48:20.781 --> 00:48:21.842]  By the way, it's coming to Austin.
[00:48:24.964 --> 00:48:36.292]  I hate to tell the story of what I witnessed not too far from these studios, but let's just say people are dropping trowel right on the sidewalk here and relieving themselves.
[00:48:37.227 --> 00:48:40.370]  But here's just some b-roll of the poop crews.
[00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:43.233]  By the way, that's an actual job now, too, in San Francisco.
[00:48:43.273 --> 00:48:43.893]  So, you know what?
[00:48:43.953 --> 00:48:45.555]  At least they're creating jobs out there.
[00:48:46.375 --> 00:48:50.399]  The Democrats are creating jobs with all the needles and feces on the street.
[00:48:52.401 --> 00:48:59.007]  These people ban plastic straws and then hand out plastic needles for people to get high and encourage pooping in the street.
[00:48:59.047 --> 00:49:00.769]  It's, you know, it's progressive.
[00:49:02.728 --> 00:49:05.570]  The graph, though, I mean, you can look at these numbers.
[00:49:05.671 --> 00:49:07.112]  They actually have a graph for this, too.
[00:49:07.973 --> 00:49:10.415]  Human feces incidents by year in San Francisco.
[00:49:10.775 --> 00:49:12.977]  In 2018, they had over 28,000 incidents.
[00:49:13.017 --> 00:49:14.078]  Now, look.
[00:49:17.401 --> 00:49:22.225]  I've never hosted SNL, but I have a feeling this is what it would feel like, talking about poop maps.
[00:49:22.365 --> 00:49:23.286]  But this is actually real.
[00:49:24.258 --> 00:49:26.500]  From the San Francisco Department of Public Works?
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.361]  I mean, I'm telling you, they're creating jobs!
[00:49:28.561 --> 00:49:29.702]  There's a poop market!
[00:49:30.522 --> 00:49:32.003]  There is a poop market!
[00:49:32.223 --> 00:49:32.844]  Oh my God.
[00:49:33.684 --> 00:49:37.147]  The whole San Francisco map is now totally brown.
[00:49:37.327 --> 00:49:38.227]  They're having a brownout.
[00:49:40.429 --> 00:49:41.570]  They've had a total brownout.
[00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:43.751]  That is disgusting.
[00:49:44.131 --> 00:49:44.512]  Oh my God.
[00:49:44.792 --> 00:49:47.133]  Parts of it, it's so overwhelmed with feces, folks.
[00:49:47.694 --> 00:49:48.094]  Oh my God.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:54.842]  But it's like, I can sit here, it's like, oh, this is what happens when Democrats run your city.
[00:49:54.882 --> 00:49:57.143]  And yeah, of course, you know, this is what happens when Democrats run your city.
[00:49:57.183 --> 00:49:58.924]  But this is beyond that.
[00:49:59.724 --> 00:50:02.326]  This is what happens when psychos run your city.
[00:50:02.606 --> 00:50:06.068]  This is what happens when sick people run your city, right here.
[00:50:08.649 --> 00:50:10.270]  What has happened to San Francisco?
[00:50:12.692 --> 00:50:13.812]  Wow.
[00:50:14.073 --> 00:50:14.853]  You know, it's really sad.
[00:50:14.873 --> 00:50:16.414]  I have a friend in San Francisco.
[00:50:18.555 --> 00:50:19.916]  And she does well for herself.
[00:50:21.328 --> 00:50:30.516]  She says every day she walks outside, her and her fiancé, needles and poop everywhere.
[00:50:30.896 --> 00:50:36.241]  Sometimes, sometimes they walk outside with their coffee, someone's right by their stoop, relieving themselves.
[00:50:37.302 --> 00:50:38.303]  And they're like, hey, go away!
[00:50:38.323 --> 00:50:38.743]  They don't move.
[00:50:39.844 --> 00:50:40.725]  Because they're entitled.
[00:50:40.785 --> 00:50:42.106]  See, that's their toilet.
[00:50:43.047 --> 00:50:46.890]  You don't go into the bathroom and tell someone to get off the toilet.
[00:50:49.639 --> 00:50:50.700]  So this is what they do.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:51.761]  And that's what I'm saying, though.
[00:50:54.363 --> 00:50:59.687]  People that are, you would consider, upper middle class are living in this swaller.
[00:51:00.407 --> 00:51:11.816]  The only way to avoid this is to be upper upper class in San Francisco and either live on, like, you know, the 20th floor of a high-rise or get out into the mountains on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge.
[00:51:13.337 --> 00:51:14.798]  But most people can't afford that.
[00:51:15.859 --> 00:51:18.101]  And so they can only afford the apartment.
[00:51:19.178 --> 00:51:19.658]  Or the home.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.701]  Right next to the human toilet.
[00:51:28.386 --> 00:51:29.126]  But don't worry.
[00:51:29.807 --> 00:51:31.308]  The Democrats are creating jobs.
[00:51:31.608 --> 00:51:33.590]  You have poop squads to clean up the poop.
[00:51:34.691 --> 00:51:43.859]  You now have the San Francisco Department of Public Works having to do actual research so that they can give a number of how many poop incidents there are.
[00:51:46.501 --> 00:51:47.642]  What are we dealing with?
[00:51:53.499 --> 00:52:03.110]  So hey, why don't we just send anybody who wants to do heroin and poop on the streets to San Francisco and they can have their own little enclave?
[00:52:04.271 --> 00:52:06.574]  And it's sad that this is what eventually I think
[00:52:08.004 --> 00:52:09.045]  Is the smartest thing to do.
[00:52:09.085 --> 00:52:10.205]  It'll probably never happen.
[00:52:10.225 --> 00:52:17.069]  But I mean, I really think that America should almost just sacrifice California to save America.
[00:52:17.129 --> 00:52:18.489]  I mean, it's almost reached that point.
[00:52:18.509 --> 00:52:23.252]  I mean, just send all the liberals, send all the progressives, let the Democrats run California.
[00:52:23.272 --> 00:52:24.092]  They can have the whole state.
[00:52:24.192 --> 00:52:25.693]  It's beautiful resources, everything.
[00:52:25.773 --> 00:52:27.294]  It's sad, but maybe we should just do that.
[00:52:27.354 --> 00:52:29.655]  Say, hey, look, you guys think you can run everything?
[00:52:29.675 --> 00:52:31.476]  You guys think you got it all figured out?
[00:52:31.676 --> 00:52:33.017]  You want to test your socialism?
[00:52:33.357 --> 00:52:37.019]  They already got, I think it's Stockton County in California, they're already giving out free money.
[00:52:37.479 --> 00:52:38.640]  Look up what they're doing in Stockton.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.442]  I think it's like 400 annually a month or something in Stockton, California.
[00:52:41.462 --> 00:52:45.044]  So they're testing, they're testing the government just giving you money to see how that works.
[00:52:45.084 --> 00:52:48.646]  So, so, you know, in Stockton there'll probably be piles of feces next month too.
[00:52:49.727 --> 00:52:51.908]  So we'll just say, fine, have California.
[00:52:52.668 --> 00:52:53.029]  Have it.
[00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:54.810]  Do your little experiments.
[00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:56.090]  Give people money.
[00:52:56.491 --> 00:52:57.651]  Let them poop in the streets.
[00:52:58.432 --> 00:52:59.693]  Let them do heroin in the streets.
[00:53:00.615 --> 00:53:03.776]  And just, you know, we'll see what California looks like in 10 years.
[00:53:03.836 --> 00:53:09.118]  Now, they'll be a socialist hellhole like Central America and people will be fleeing California.
[00:53:10.939 --> 00:53:11.959]  That's called irony.
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:17.762]  So yeah, have your wide open border in California.
[00:53:18.522 --> 00:53:21.043]  Have all of your socialist communist policies.
[00:53:21.083 --> 00:53:21.803]  Bring them all in.
[00:53:22.163 --> 00:53:23.544]  The taxes keep going up.
[00:53:23.604 --> 00:53:24.784]  The rent keeps going up.
[00:53:24.824 --> 00:53:26.585]  The piles of feces keep going up.
[00:53:26.625 --> 00:53:28.166]  The heroin piles keep coming up.
[00:53:28.186 --> 00:53:28.966]  The needles, everything.
[00:53:30.151 --> 00:53:35.473]  The tent cities, and that will be your progressive Democrat example!
[00:53:36.293 --> 00:53:36.993]  It's beautiful!
[00:53:37.753 --> 00:53:41.454]  Because see, it already is, but they just, it hasn't stuck to them.
[00:53:41.534 --> 00:53:42.735]  It's time to make it stick.
[00:53:44.655 --> 00:53:46.936]  And I think it's sad that this is what it's come to, but I mean, gee.
[00:53:46.956 --> 00:53:57.319]  I mean, it's like if you find out your ankle or something has gangrene, and you gotta cut it off to survive, then you know, it's coming off!
[00:53:58.942 --> 00:54:01.664]  You don't want to lose your foot, but you don't want to die.
[00:54:03.265 --> 00:54:09.830]  So, California, $500 a month right now in Stockton, California, basic income.
[00:54:10.751 --> 00:54:13.092]  Just take it statewide.
[00:54:14.353 --> 00:54:20.758]  So, California is the foot, the ankle with gangrene, totally infected, has to be amputated, it must be done.
[00:54:22.329 --> 00:54:29.556]  But see, they're saying, this is like a doctor coming in and saying, oh, the gangrene is good.
[00:54:30.057 --> 00:54:31.098]  It's fair.
[00:54:32.379 --> 00:54:37.364]  The gangrene allows the body to experience gangrene.
[00:54:37.384 --> 00:54:39.846]  You have to be tolerant of the gangrene.
[00:54:40.287 --> 00:54:41.888]  You have to be tolerant.
[00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:44.050]  Don't amputate!
[00:54:44.391 --> 00:54:45.531]  That's racist!
[00:54:45.831 --> 00:54:49.332]  Don't discriminate against a gangrene eating your leg off!
[00:54:50.032 --> 00:54:50.993]  Let it spread!
[00:54:51.413 --> 00:54:52.573]  Let it get to your knee!
[00:54:52.893 --> 00:54:53.933]  Let it get to your hip!
[00:54:54.974 --> 00:54:56.334]  Let it get to your waist!
[00:54:56.794 --> 00:54:57.235]  Yes!
[00:54:57.935 --> 00:54:59.235]  Let it get to your torso!
[00:54:59.655 --> 00:55:00.836]  Let it get to your chest!
[00:55:01.096 --> 00:55:02.316]  Let it get to your body cavity!
[00:55:02.536 --> 00:55:04.057]  Let it get to your arms and your shoulders!
[00:55:04.297 --> 00:55:05.137]  Eventually to your neck!
[00:55:05.477 --> 00:55:07.638]  Don't discriminate against gangrene!
[00:55:07.898 --> 00:55:09.338]  Don't cut it off at the ankle!
[00:55:09.578 --> 00:55:10.839]  Let it kill you!
[00:55:12.978 --> 00:55:18.219]  It's good, it's tolerant, it's loving, it's liberal, it's progressive.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:22.421]  No, California is the gangrene of America.
[00:55:22.541 --> 00:55:23.601]  It needs to be lopped off.
[00:55:24.041 --> 00:55:25.801]  And New York is heading in the right direction.
[00:55:27.462 --> 00:55:30.203]  Bill de Blasio wants to tear down skyscrapers.
[00:55:31.043 --> 00:55:33.244]  Dude, what drugs are you on?
[00:55:33.384 --> 00:55:34.864]  Can we hang out this weekend, bro?
[00:55:34.984 --> 00:55:36.424]  You are high as a kite.
[00:55:37.565 --> 00:55:39.125]  Maybe you've been hanging out with AOC.
[00:55:39.485 --> 00:55:42.226]  Cause, you know, she's a little hyped up herself.
[00:55:45.014 --> 00:55:57.424]  And actually, there is a political race right now, I believe it's in New York, where the two competing candidates are basically calling out the other one as being a drug addict, so now they're about to meet and do a urine test.
[00:56:02.308 --> 00:56:05.371]  So let's just see what San Francisco's poop
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:07.420]  Numbers are for 2019.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.861]  You're gonna have listen to this.
[00:56:09.901 --> 00:56:12.782]  In fact, I want to you guys pull up a calculator and do this math right now.
[00:56:13.262 --> 00:56:19.744]  Let's be conservative and say there's 30,000 incidents in San Francisco 30,000 incidents in San Francisco in 2019, which actually they're on pace for
[00:56:24.554 --> 00:56:24.934]  Closer to 35.
[00:56:25.235 --> 00:56:28.257]  So let's just go with, let's actually just go with 32.
[00:56:28.357 --> 00:56:33.101]  So we'll still be conservative, but let's just go 32,000 divided by 365.
[00:56:33.421 --> 00:56:35.723]  Let's figure out that math.
[00:56:35.983 --> 00:56:40.226]  How many times someone takes a dump in the streets of San Francisco every day?
[00:56:40.246 --> 00:56:41.127]  80 times?
[00:56:42.768 --> 00:56:43.649]  88 times a day.
[00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:47.011]  That's the new slogan for San Francisco.
[00:56:47.672 --> 00:56:53.136]  Come on down to San Francisco, where someone poops in the streets 88 times a day.
[00:56:55.455 --> 00:56:55.895]  That's right.
[00:56:56.376 --> 00:57:08.764]  While you're walking around the beautiful streets of San Francisco, smelling the feces, seeing the feces, it invades your nostrils with its... Ugh.
[00:57:10.385 --> 00:57:11.186]  But don't worry!
[00:57:11.586 --> 00:57:20.192]  As you're walking through the streets of San Francisco, at 88 times a day, the odds that you see someone taking a dump are very high.
[00:57:21.803 --> 00:57:24.764]  Come on down to San Francisco!
[00:57:25.644 --> 00:57:31.485]  The number one tourist attraction, homeless bums crapping in the street!
[00:57:33.545 --> 00:57:34.085]  What's that?
[00:57:35.286 --> 00:57:35.706]  What's that?
[00:57:35.766 --> 00:57:42.607]  You just rented a five-star hotel, Airbnb, and you walked outside and you saw a bum crapping his pants?
[00:57:43.067 --> 00:57:46.048]  You should be thankful it wasn't four bums at one time!
[00:57:46.548 --> 00:57:48.588]  That's San Francisco!
[00:57:49.168 --> 00:57:51.469]  I'm telling you, just sacrifice San Francisco to the Democrats.
[00:57:57.237 --> 00:58:01.240]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:03.461]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[00:58:03.581 --> 00:58:04.282]  Good to talk to you.
[00:58:04.622 --> 00:58:08.805]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[00:58:09.025 --> 00:58:10.767]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[00:58:10.867 --> 00:58:15.250]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:17.371]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[00:58:17.431 --> 00:58:21.794]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate that.
[00:58:21.855 --> 00:58:23.356]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[00:58:23.396 --> 00:58:23.876]  Tell us about it.
[00:58:23.936 --> 00:58:24.636]  Well, it's really great.
[00:58:24.656 --> 00:58:25.856]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[00:58:25.896 --> 00:58:26.337]  I take it.
[00:58:26.397 --> 00:58:27.017]  It tastes good.
[00:58:27.077 --> 00:58:28.777]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[00:58:28.837 --> 00:58:30.538]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[00:58:30.698 --> 00:58:33.178]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[00:58:33.198 --> 00:58:33.979]  So I really like it.
[00:58:33.999 --> 00:58:36.679]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[00:58:36.719 --> 00:58:38.260]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:40.240]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:40.860]  So, yeah.
[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:43.081]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[00:58:43.541 --> 00:58:45.842]  These are amazing things in ultimate female force.
[00:58:45.862 --> 00:58:47.142]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[00:58:47.302 --> 00:58:49.022]  Infowarshtore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:53.419 --> 00:58:58.403]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[00:58:58.644 --> 00:59:06.190]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[00:59:07.211 --> 00:59:09.773]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[00:59:10.193 --> 00:59:11.535]  How can I solve that problem?
[00:59:11.935 --> 00:59:18.220]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[00:59:20.282 --> 00:59:25.185]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[00:59:25.605 --> 00:59:28.527]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[00:59:28.567 --> 00:59:32.149]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[00:59:32.169 --> 00:59:36.071]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:59:36.471 --> 00:59:38.172]  I've got two in my home.
[00:59:38.312 --> 00:59:43.915]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[00:59:44.395 --> 00:59:45.256]  Don't live
[00:59:46.076 --> 00:59:49.758]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[00:59:49.778 --> 00:59:52.039]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:56.622 --> 01:00:00.584]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:14.195 --> 01:00:15.596]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:15.856 --> 01:00:17.017]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:17.578 --> 01:00:18.999]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.519 --> 01:00:22.582]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:00:22.842 --> 01:00:30.108]  So, the new gang green deal that we've introduced for California is already making waves.
[01:00:30.328 --> 01:00:35.092]  In fact, the amount of poop jokes that went on during the break, I can't even believe it.
[01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:37.874]  But I think it's time to flush them.
[01:00:40.407 --> 01:00:45.390]  For real though, let's introduce the new gangrene deal and let's amputate California.
[01:00:45.530 --> 01:01:09.786]  California has gangrene and if we don't, as April Ryan said about Sarah Sanders, lop her head off, if we don't lop California off, then the gangrene is going to eventually contaminate, well it's already happening, contaminating Texas, it's contaminating Colorado, it's contaminating Las Vegas, it's spreading folks, it's spreading.
[01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:25.581]  But you'll notice though, I'll make a prediction right now, that in 2019, there will be 35,000 poop incidents on the streets of San Francisco in the calendar year 2019.
[01:01:28.422 --> 01:01:30.003]  That's almost a hundred a day.
[01:01:30.483 --> 01:01:31.224]  So we'll get there.
[01:01:32.224 --> 01:01:39.587]  But as the feces piles higher and higher in San Francisco, so does the price for rent.
[01:01:46.297 --> 01:01:53.283]  You know, I don't even know how you really properly analyze this because I don't think there's ever really been a fair analysis.
[01:01:54.424 --> 01:01:54.604]  But.
[01:01:57.946 --> 01:01:59.067]  And they'll just never admit it.
[01:01:59.107 --> 01:01:59.688]  That's the problem.
[01:02:00.068 --> 01:02:02.150]  San Francisco cannot look in the mirror.
[01:02:04.432 --> 01:02:08.295]  Gavin Newsom cannot look in the mirror about what's happening in L.A.
[01:02:08.695 --> 01:02:09.496]  and San Francisco.
[01:02:17.307 --> 01:02:22.631]  You just have to wonder why this isn't, like, big news for Gavin Newsom.
[01:02:22.651 --> 01:02:24.333]  Uh-oh, Eric Swalwell, though.
[01:02:24.353 --> 01:02:28.997]  You see, Eric Swalwell has done such a great job in his district.
[01:02:29.077 --> 01:02:34.301]  He's done such a poopy job in his district that he's gonna run for president now, you see.
[01:02:35.602 --> 01:02:37.364]  And he's popular.
[01:02:38.264 --> 01:02:45.010]  He's running for president, Eric Swalwell, where if you walk around the streets of his district, well,
[01:02:46.445 --> 01:02:47.926]  You're gonna have to clean your shoes afterwards.
[01:02:52.069 --> 01:03:05.578]  But don't worry because we've got Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi and Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff out there on the coast of California making sure that California is full of crap.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:08.901]  So I introduce
[01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:14.280]  The new gangrene deal to amputate California.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:19.182]  It's sad to see California go, just like it's sad to chop off your infected foot.
[01:03:19.903 --> 01:03:25.085]  But, you don't want it to spread, you don't want to eventually lose your leg.
[01:03:26.086 --> 01:03:31.088]  And so, the new gangrene deal, amputate California to save America.
[01:03:32.429 --> 01:03:34.930]  And here in Texas, I mean, we're getting the gangrene.
[01:03:36.031 --> 01:03:38.072]  The people are starting to poop here on the streets of Austin.
[01:03:39.112 --> 01:03:40.053]  Austin's a beautiful city.
[01:03:44.245 --> 01:04:01.836]  More and more you drive around certain places you're gonna see drug addicts flopping around on the sidewalk and and bums urinating and and and pooping on the street I mean I I was stunned I mean I've lived in Austin for three years now I'd never seen this but
[01:04:03.493 --> 01:04:07.055]  In the last couple months, I've seen more people just urinating in public.
[01:04:07.095 --> 01:04:09.957]  They don't even go behind corners here in Austin, either.
[01:04:10.337 --> 01:04:12.018]  They are walking on the sidewalk.
[01:04:13.819 --> 01:04:14.420]  You know what?
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.621]  Hanging out, just casually urinating as they walk.
[01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:24.726]  Sitting at bus stops, bent over, trousers on their ankles, taking a dump.
[01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:28.408]  I mean, gosh!
[01:04:29.008 --> 01:04:31.850]  And so, I see this stuff, and I'm like,
[01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:37.967]  How do I get to the country?
[01:04:39.867 --> 01:04:40.088]  How?
[01:04:40.288 --> 01:04:41.988]  I can't get to the country soon enough.
[01:04:42.049 --> 01:04:43.169]  You see stuff like that?
[01:04:43.389 --> 01:04:44.170]  Oh my gosh.
[01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:46.951]  The new gangrene deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:47.191 --> 01:04:49.832]  Amputate California to save America.
[01:04:50.412 --> 01:04:53.374]  But they sit out there in California and act like they got it all figured out.
[01:04:53.714 --> 01:04:56.775]  You know, Eric Swalwell's gonna run for president.
[01:04:56.815 --> 01:04:58.956]  That total dingbat.
[01:04:59.297 --> 01:05:01.778]  But yeah, yeah, yeah, you gotta figure it out, Swalwell.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:09.001]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.
[01:05:09.341 --> 01:05:09.921]  Alpha Power.

[01:06:14.076 --> 01:06:14.776]  Big Brother.
[01:06:15.216 --> 01:06:16.457]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:17.017 --> 01:06:18.157]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:18.897 --> 01:06:20.358]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:20.618 --> 01:06:21.759]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:22.259 --> 01:06:26.961]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:27.361 --> 01:06:30.402]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:34.269 --> 01:06:42.099]  You know, we constantly forget in our obsession with news here that we're under total attack and censorship.
[01:06:42.199 --> 01:06:45.844]  And I actually have these two news stories on my desk every day to make sure I remember.
[01:06:45.924 --> 01:06:47.646]  And this isn't even about the censorship, but...
[01:06:49.141 --> 01:06:54.123]  Remember last week when Bernie Sanders said Infowars is a white supremacist platform?
[01:06:54.483 --> 01:07:04.308]  You remember last week when CBS just announced their new TV series, The Good Fight, which encourages its audience to beat up Trump supporters and assassinate Trump?
[01:07:06.369 --> 01:07:14.052]  This is the left, the totally unhinged psychopath left, putting a target on our backs.
[01:07:16.298 --> 01:07:18.260]  And you better get ready, folks.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.661]  This is not a game.
[01:07:20.201 --> 01:07:28.928]  But in 2020, if Trump wins another election, they're going to go into hot civil war against conservatives.
[01:07:29.989 --> 01:07:31.310]  They will reach that level, folks.
[01:07:31.651 --> 01:07:31.951]  They will.
[01:07:34.413 --> 01:07:36.334]  Now, I'm not calling for violence.
[01:07:36.535 --> 01:07:37.235]  I don't want violence.
[01:07:37.335 --> 01:07:38.516]  I don't want to see a civil war.
[01:07:40.037 --> 01:07:41.359]  I want to see truth and justice.
[01:07:42.479 --> 01:07:43.100]  These people don't.
[01:07:45.831 --> 01:07:48.332]  They're so committed to their lies that they can't get over it.
[01:07:48.372 --> 01:07:58.858]  So, I just always put this here to remind myself that... Oh, and by the way, CBS's TV show where they encourage people to engage in violence against Trump supporters and conservatives and white people, by the way, that doesn't get banned from Twitter.
[01:07:59.098 --> 01:08:01.139]  We get banned from Twitter, but, you know, that doesn't.
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:05.342]  A live mass shooting in New Zealand is allowed to stay up for hours on end.
[01:08:05.742 --> 01:08:09.644]  I try to broadcast Facebook, The War Room Show, we get banned in seven minutes.
[01:08:09.764 --> 01:08:10.645]  So, you know, that's funny.
[01:08:11.025 --> 01:08:14.507]  And then, you know, Bernie Sanders says we're white supremacists, so go out and, you know, try to kill us.
[01:08:15.623 --> 01:08:16.684]  That's what we deal with here at InfoWars.
[01:08:16.804 --> 01:08:26.632]  So, we know we're under these attacks, and we need to fund ourselves so that we can exist amidst the censorship.
[01:08:27.713 --> 01:08:36.000]  And what drives them crazy, with all their attacks against us, all their lies against us, what drives them crazy is the fact that we're still here broadcasting every day.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:40.624]  Every day, they wake up hoping that the Alex Jones Show will be off air.
[01:08:42.196 --> 01:08:47.300]  Every day they wake up hoping when they go to Infowars.com slash show, because trust me, they do.
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:53.664]  Just as much as our loyal audience is the haters that write about us and want to see us shut down.
[01:08:53.744 --> 01:08:54.725]  They're just as obsessed.
[01:08:54.865 --> 01:08:56.366]  In fact, they're probably more obsessed.
[01:08:56.826 --> 01:08:57.947]  They're derangedly obsessed.
[01:08:59.408 --> 01:09:00.308]  But they'll never admit it.
[01:09:01.389 --> 01:09:05.252]  But you know, because they're always writing about us, always trying to get us shut down.
[01:09:06.775 --> 01:09:19.660]  And nothing angers them more when they wake up, or they go to get their coffee, or get their lunch, or whatever, and they go to Infowars.com, and they're just praying, today's the day it'll be shut down, and it's still up.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:26.662]  They grind their teeth, and they crush their coffee, their soy latte cup, and they just get so mad.
[01:09:27.142 --> 01:09:31.284]  Because they've been fighting so hard to shut us down, and they think they're in the righteous battle.
[01:09:33.049 --> 01:09:37.791]  Meanwhile, they're totally committed to evil, totally committed to lies, totally disconnected from God.
[01:09:39.392 --> 01:09:42.553]  And they can't stand it that InfoWars is still on the air.
[01:09:43.153 --> 01:09:45.934]  How is it possible that Alex is still on the air?
[01:09:47.235 --> 01:09:49.656]  Well, it's possible with your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:09:49.676 --> 01:09:51.117]  So, do me a favor, because look.
[01:09:52.937 --> 01:09:54.938]  You know Brian Stelter wants a shutdown.
[01:09:55.178 --> 01:09:55.799]  Brian Stelter!
[01:09:56.999 --> 01:10:01.461]  You know that the... the rat man... Brian Stelter!
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.602]  You know that the rat man, Oliver Darcy, wants us shut down.
[01:10:05.863 --> 01:10:08.926]  Once he's, you know, finished cleaning up his pet possums.
[01:10:10.007 --> 01:10:12.389]  Anyway, you know they want us shut down.
[01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:16.974]  And look, if you want to anger them, we're not violent people.
[01:10:17.014 --> 01:10:20.558]  We don't want you to stalk or harass these clowns at CNN.
[01:10:20.578 --> 01:10:21.479]  You know, leave them alone.
[01:10:21.539 --> 01:10:22.320]  Let them do their thing.
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:26.204]  But if you go shop at Infowarshore.com, that drives them crazy.
[01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:31.491]  It drives them so crazy that they then call their audience to come harass us.
[01:10:32.011 --> 01:10:32.991]  So that's them.
[01:10:33.871 --> 01:10:40.234]  They're so mad that we still exist, they wish they could come harass us, but they don't have the courage to do it, so they just call on their audience to do so.
[01:10:41.714 --> 01:10:48.397]  But believe me, when you shop at Infowarsstore.com, the people at CNN that want to shut down pull their hair out.
[01:10:48.517 --> 01:10:49.637]  Except some of them don't have hair.
[01:10:49.777 --> 01:10:50.278]  Brian Stelter.
[01:10:53.095 --> 01:10:57.503]  It is a total gut blow to the enemies of InfoWars when you shop at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:10:57.523 --> 01:10:59.005]  Now we've got specials going right now.
[01:11:00.373 --> 01:11:01.394]  Check them out for yourself.
[01:11:01.454 --> 01:11:05.656]  The t-shirt sale is over, so it's now full price to get the InfoWars apparel.
[01:11:06.136 --> 01:11:09.138]  There might be some specials out there, but the half off the apparel is over.
[01:11:09.978 --> 01:11:11.339]  But there are other specials.
[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:14.461]  Oh no, the special for the shirts is still on, actually.
[01:11:15.221 --> 01:11:18.003]  So I've been... I've been fake news.
[01:11:18.383 --> 01:11:21.565]  The 50% off all apparel is still on.
[01:11:21.865 --> 01:11:23.206]  That was supposed to end last night.
[01:11:25.107 --> 01:11:26.508]  That's just what happens here at InfoWars.
[01:11:26.528 --> 01:11:29.930]  We're just, again, we're just so committed to the news, we don't even do our own jobs.
[01:11:31.195 --> 01:11:34.136]  This t-shirt special was supposed to end, but it's still up.
[01:11:34.276 --> 01:11:43.801]  So take advantage of our negligence to quit giving away t-shirts at cost and go to InfoWarsStore.com, get a hat, get a t-shirt, support InfoWars.
[01:11:44.561 --> 01:11:45.422]  Just check it all out.
[01:11:46.022 --> 01:11:47.983]  You're going to find a t-shirt you like, a hat you like.
[01:11:48.023 --> 01:11:48.983]  There's so many now.
[01:11:49.163 --> 01:11:50.804]  I mean, it's impossible to even keep up.
[01:11:50.844 --> 01:11:52.785]  It's like I go on there and I see a new shirt every day.
[01:11:53.685 --> 01:11:56.647]  Hoodies, hats, shirts, it's all 50% off right now.
[01:11:56.707 --> 01:11:57.187]  Take advantage.
[01:11:57.207 --> 01:11:57.987]  That's not going to last.
[01:12:00.555 --> 01:12:06.859]  Alex is busy on a work trip right now, so we'll see what happens with that special, but it was supposed to be shut down last night.
[01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.821]  Thank you so much for your support at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:12:10.042 --> 01:12:25.172]  Now, we're putting out a call to the group that protested
[01:12:28.072 --> 01:12:34.137]  We're putting out a call to the American Identity Movement who protested the Drag Queen Story Hour.
[01:12:34.378 --> 01:12:40.763]  And this is really interesting here because how do you fight insanity?
[01:12:40.803 --> 01:12:44.307]  How do you combat insanity intellectually in a political battle?
[01:12:45.888 --> 01:12:47.409]  We can't reason with these people.
[01:12:47.609 --> 01:12:48.450]  Logic doesn't work.
[01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:49.170]  Facts don't work.
[01:12:49.210 --> 01:12:51.792]  So the only thing that works is insanity.
[01:12:52.272 --> 01:12:53.613]  It's like fighting fire with fire.
[01:12:53.633 --> 01:12:55.234]  You have to fight insanity with insanity.
[01:12:55.275 --> 01:13:04.301]  So to protest the Drag Queen Story Hour, these individuals dressed up as clowns and they rolled out their Drag Queen Story Hour adult entertainment for kids.
[01:13:04.361 --> 01:13:05.301]  Welcome to clown world.
[01:13:06.222 --> 01:13:07.083]  You know, gay flag.
[01:13:07.103 --> 01:13:08.063]  And what's wrong with that?
[01:13:08.123 --> 01:13:08.924]  They're dressed as clowns.
[01:13:08.964 --> 01:13:09.925]  It's Drag Queen Story Hour.
[01:13:10.185 --> 01:13:10.905]  Oh, but guess what?
[01:13:11.566 --> 01:13:12.727]  They got kicked out!
[01:13:14.002 --> 01:13:15.262]  Isn't that ironic?
[01:13:15.762 --> 01:13:16.763]  Why did they get kicked out?
[01:13:16.843 --> 01:13:19.383]  Because they don't want to play with your kids.
[01:13:19.983 --> 01:13:24.164]  So the clowns that are there, they got discriminated against.
[01:13:25.385 --> 01:13:26.765]  Because they didn't want to play with your kids.
[01:13:27.025 --> 01:13:35.267]  But the drag queens that showed up to play with your kids, well you see, that's acceptable, that's normal, that's why we're holding this event.
[01:13:35.587 --> 01:13:36.647]  Don't you see clowns?
[01:13:37.487 --> 01:13:40.608]  This event is for drag queens that want to play with kids!
[01:13:41.528 --> 01:13:43.629]  Not for clowns that want to show up!
[01:13:44.369 --> 01:13:45.950]  How dare you show up!
[01:13:47.191 --> 01:13:50.332]  And by the way, if they would have done this in London, they would have been arrested.
[01:13:52.073 --> 01:13:54.474]  Oh, but guess what we found out?
[01:13:55.275 --> 01:14:00.077]  We looked into some of these drag queen story hours, and guess who infiltrated?
[01:14:01.258 --> 01:14:01.858]  Pedophiles.
[01:14:02.981 --> 01:14:11.444]  You're telling me that a known pedophile with a sex offender record is gonna put on makeup to hide his identity to play with kids?
[01:14:13.645 --> 01:14:16.286]  I guess that's not so far-fetched after all, is it?
[01:14:16.746 --> 01:14:18.406]  Nope, because that's reality.
[01:14:18.667 --> 01:14:25.069]  But how dare clowns show up to protest pedophiles infiltrating Drag Queen Story Hour?
[01:14:25.869 --> 01:14:27.790]  In fact, what the hell's wrong with you?
[01:14:29.588 --> 01:14:32.149]  You don't want your kid to play with potential pedophiles?
[01:14:32.529 --> 01:14:35.571]  You don't want a drag queen bouncing your kid on their Johnson?
[01:14:36.111 --> 01:14:38.892]  You don't want a pedophile telling your kid to shake its butt?
[01:14:39.973 --> 01:14:41.253]  Oh, it's just a drag queen.
[01:14:41.433 --> 01:14:42.414]  Don't be intolerant.
[01:14:43.855 --> 01:14:44.315]  What's next?
[01:14:44.335 --> 01:14:46.496]  You're gonna tell kids to play with condoms and dildos?
[01:14:46.836 --> 01:14:47.216]  Oh, wait!
[01:14:47.396 --> 01:14:48.437]  They already do that, too!
[01:14:50.578 --> 01:14:57.701]  This is what Satan does, folks, but we have to fight insanity with insanity, so I hope that we hear from the American Identity Movement
[01:14:58.797 --> 01:15:01.979]  Because we want to get them on the Alex Jones Show to talk about this protest.
[01:15:02.039 --> 01:15:04.460]  But look, I think this thing needs to go viral.
[01:15:05.701 --> 01:15:11.344]  I mean, we've showed up at the Drag Queen Story Times as journalists to cover it, but this is the next level.
[01:15:11.384 --> 01:15:15.246]  So, we've already raised the awareness, we've already raised the red flag, we've already put it on display.
[01:15:15.767 --> 01:15:20.990]  Now it's time to fight insanity with insanity, show up as a clown, hell, just claim you're a drag queen!
[01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:23.491]  I mean, what the hell's the difference?
[01:15:23.991 --> 01:15:26.913]  But they're going to kick you out because you're not there to play with kids.
[01:15:28.228 --> 01:15:30.231]  Sounds sick, but that's the reality.
[01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:40.184]  And you know, I was assaulted by one of these drag queens, but you know the problem is, I can't identify my assaulter.
[01:15:40.385 --> 01:15:40.645]  Why?
[01:15:40.785 --> 01:15:42.067]  Because they wore a mask.
[01:15:42.628 --> 01:15:44.691]  They painted their face like a demon.
[01:15:46.195 --> 01:15:58.082]  So that allows these assaulters and pedophiles to go out hiding their identity with their drag queen face makeup mask so that they can go around identity hidden so that you don't know who they really are.
[01:15:58.142 --> 01:16:00.904]  And then they can assault you and play with your kids and get away with it.
[01:16:02.731 --> 01:16:05.834]  RainForce Plus is a top-tier nootropin.

[01:19:22.807 --> 01:19:23.988]  It's a gay bomb, baby!
[01:19:24.048 --> 01:19:27.009]  And I'm not saying people didn't naturally have homosexual feelings.
[01:19:27.049 --> 01:19:28.770]  I'm not even getting into it, quite frankly.
[01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:29.711]  I mean, give me a break!
[01:19:45.815 --> 01:19:47.756]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[01:20:45.628 --> 01:20:47.249]  Which ain't so free tomorrow, is it?
[01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:49.932]  Because they try to censor us.
[01:20:50.452 --> 01:20:51.553]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:52.734 --> 01:20:54.635]  Filling in for Alex, I am Owen Schroer.
[01:20:54.835 --> 01:20:57.498]  Alex is on a work trip to DC right now.
[01:20:58.855 --> 01:21:00.497]  on a special mission.
[01:21:01.778 --> 01:21:13.227]  And so you're going to enjoy some of the content that Alex will be producing here over the next couple of days as I'm filling in.
[01:21:14.388 --> 01:21:16.650]  And you'll also be hearing from Alex here as well.
[01:21:17.631 --> 01:21:23.776]  But Alex Jones, a man on a mission in Washington, D.C.
[01:21:26.192 --> 01:21:28.874]  And, you know, I'm telling you, there is an energy in D.C.
[01:21:30.315 --> 01:21:40.483]  I don't know how the people put up with it, but you gotta go there in battle mode to really be effective.
[01:21:41.323 --> 01:21:48.128]  Because those demonic energies that are coming out of D.C.
[01:21:48.208 --> 01:21:49.329]  are very overwhelming.
[01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:52.091]  Now, an example
[01:21:53.237 --> 01:21:56.318]  I would say is what's been going on with Bob Woodward.
[01:21:56.418 --> 01:22:11.585]  Now look, I don't want to put too much stake in any of this because when I boil it down, I say, alright, here's Bob Woodward, really a washed up journalist, who wanted to be relevant and wanted to make some money.
[01:22:12.685 --> 01:22:16.107]  And with everybody focused on Trump and then Russian collusion and everything,
[01:22:17.932 --> 01:22:22.834]  Bob Woodward decided to use his namesake to profit off of the Trump economy.
[01:22:23.494 --> 01:22:24.895]  And so he wrote a book.
[01:22:26.695 --> 01:22:27.536]  When did that book come out?
[01:22:27.556 --> 01:22:28.596]  About a year ago now?
[01:22:29.897 --> 01:22:33.138]  Number one New York Times bestseller, Fear, Trump in the White House.
[01:22:33.198 --> 01:22:37.319]  Now if you recall, now see again, this is a blessing and a curse to have a memory.
[01:22:37.759 --> 01:22:40.761]  If you recall, Bob Woodward's book was pushed everywhere.
[01:22:42.241 --> 01:22:43.021]  Everyone promoted it.
[01:22:43.061 --> 01:22:43.922]  He did a bunch of interviews.
[01:22:45.012 --> 01:22:47.813]  And what happened in the aftermath of the release?
[01:22:48.253 --> 01:22:49.814]  The book was fake news!
[01:22:50.914 --> 01:22:51.694]  Remember all that?
[01:22:52.195 --> 01:22:53.555]  So they build up this book.
[01:22:54.675 --> 01:22:56.936]  Bob Woodward is now exposing Trump.
[01:22:56.976 --> 01:22:57.937]  The left builds it up.
[01:22:58.017 --> 01:22:59.117]  It's their big moment.
[01:22:59.197 --> 01:23:01.058]  It's like the first Mueller report in a way.
[01:23:02.638 --> 01:23:04.039]  This is gonna bring down Trump.
[01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:05.319]  This will embarrass Trump.
[01:23:05.519 --> 01:23:06.720]  It's Bob Woodward.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:07.420]  Don't you know?
[01:23:09.721 --> 01:23:10.381]  Book comes out.
[01:23:12.462 --> 01:23:13.122]  The people buy it.
[01:23:15.165 --> 01:23:15.685]  People blink?
[01:23:17.146 --> 01:23:17.787]  Nobody cares!
[01:23:19.048 --> 01:23:20.508]  Oh, except, what happened?
[01:23:21.149 --> 01:23:23.030]  It came out there was a bunch of fake news in the book.
[01:23:23.650 --> 01:23:29.434]  It came out that Woodward was getting access through potential traitors inside Trump's administration.
[01:23:30.695 --> 01:23:39.040]  And more of that came out, but... So here's Bob Woodward, and this is why I don't take much stake into this, because Bob Woodward is just trying to stay relevant.
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.521]  Bob Woodward just wants to make a buck.
[01:23:40.701 --> 01:23:41.562]  I mean, okay, fine.
[01:23:42.022 --> 01:23:42.903]  So he writes this book,
[01:23:43.888 --> 01:23:44.528]  Makes a bunch of money.
[01:23:44.568 --> 01:23:45.589]  Gets built up by the left.
[01:23:46.589 --> 01:23:48.070]  No consequences of Bob Woodward.
[01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:49.310]  His bank account just increased.
[01:23:50.511 --> 01:23:51.531]  Books fake news.
[01:23:51.671 --> 01:23:53.072]  Trump hits the book for fake news.
[01:23:53.392 --> 01:23:54.712]  Sources inside the book.
[01:23:55.553 --> 01:23:57.353]  It was like a lesser version of Fury.
[01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:01.135]  Who was the author of that book?
[01:24:01.215 --> 01:24:05.917]  All these people just put out books because the left is in this hysteria right now.
[01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:11.185]  It's like they're searching for the Stargate to try to destroy Trump.
[01:24:11.245 --> 01:24:12.545]  Like, they know it's out there!
[01:24:12.826 --> 01:24:14.047]  If they could just find it!
[01:24:15.708 --> 01:24:22.292]  So they're running around like mad people, looking for this Stargate, this access to destroy Trump.
[01:24:22.352 --> 01:24:28.337]  And every book fails them, every commentator fails them, every false narrative fails them, Mueller fails them, they all fail them.
[01:24:29.377 --> 01:24:33.500]  But anyway, here's Bob Woodward, puts out a book, fear, you know, inside the Trump White House.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:35.742]  Oh, it's so bad, it's devastating to Trump, oh my gosh.
[01:24:39.195 --> 01:24:42.816]  So Bob Woodward, when did fear come out?
[01:24:44.056 --> 01:24:45.256]  I just want to know the right date here.
[01:24:48.937 --> 01:24:49.697]  So Bob Woodward, 2017.
[01:24:50.317 --> 01:24:52.098]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:24:52.118 --> 01:24:54.398]  I think it was at the end of 2017, maybe the beginning of 2018.
[01:24:54.958 --> 01:24:59.579]  And so Bob Woodward licks his finger to see which way the wind is blowing.
[01:24:59.599 --> 01:25:03.420]  And he says, hmm, a lot of the media right now is going against Trump.
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.520]  There seems to be a market for that.
[01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:06.421]  They're obsessed with trying to destroy him.
[01:25:07.761 --> 01:25:08.361]  I'm going to write a book.
[01:25:10.370 --> 01:25:12.992]  Yeah, I'm gonna write a book, and I'm going to expose the Trump White House.
[01:25:14.673 --> 01:25:18.775]  And so, okay, it gets built up, Bob Woodward writes his book, it becomes a New York Times bestseller, whatever.
[01:25:19.956 --> 01:25:21.437]  Well, now Woodward is back!
[01:25:23.017 --> 01:25:28.501]  And now Bob Woodward says that the FBI and the CIA need to be investigated over Steele dossier.
[01:25:28.781 --> 01:25:29.721]  Whoa!
[01:25:31.783 --> 01:25:35.465]  So wait, it was Bob Woodward that wrote the book Fear,
[01:25:38.971 --> 01:25:41.292]  Which was supposed to, I guess, bring Trump down.
[01:25:43.733 --> 01:25:45.053]  Came out in September of last year.
[01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:49.035]  It's about the presidency of Donald Trump.
[01:25:49.495 --> 01:25:50.735]  Hundreds of hours of interviews.
[01:25:50.775 --> 01:25:51.455]  Pull that back up.
[01:25:55.457 --> 01:25:59.098]  Hundreds of hours of interviews with members of the Trump administration.
[01:25:59.978 --> 01:26:00.999]  Go to the reception thing.
[01:26:01.179 --> 01:26:01.979]  Let's see what they're putting.
[01:26:01.999 --> 01:26:04.160]  Because this is Bob Woodward's original book.
[01:26:08.522 --> 01:26:15.146]  And so, it comes out, Trump hits it, says it's fake news, a lot of credibility problems.
[01:26:15.307 --> 01:26:16.747]  Okay, we remember that from last September.
[01:26:17.148 --> 01:26:27.334]  Now, here's Bob Woodward, he's licked his finger again, he's seen that the wind is blowing in the opposite direction, now he's going to write a book about fear, how Trump has put fear in the deep state.
[01:26:27.555 --> 01:26:31.037]  Here he is on Fox News saying that now the deep state needs to be investigated.
[01:26:31.769 --> 01:26:43.887]  More than two years ago, back in January of 2017, when the Steele dossier first surfaced, I remember your saying right here on this show that it is a, quote, garbage document.
[01:26:44.507 --> 01:26:46.250]  Do you feel that the Mueller report
[01:26:47.199 --> 01:26:52.625]  Basically discredited it, and to what degree do you think it played a role in the Russia investigation?
[01:26:52.685 --> 01:27:02.295]  Well, that's what's going to be investigated by lots of people, including the Attorney General and including Senator Lindsey Graham.
[01:27:02.595 --> 01:27:04.317]  And the Inspector General is also doing it.
[01:27:04.457 --> 01:27:06.518]  Yes, and it should be.
[01:27:06.538 --> 01:27:20.263]  I mean, what I found out recently, which was really quite surprising, the dossier, which really is got a lot of garbage in it, and Mueller found that to be the case early in
[01:27:21.303 --> 01:27:28.493]  Building the intelligence community assessment on Russian interference in an early draft.
[01:27:28.513 --> 01:27:29.334]  Sounds like a broken down.
[01:27:29.354 --> 01:27:35.442]  They actually put the dossier on page two in kind of a breakout box.
[01:27:36.163 --> 01:27:38.526]  I think it was the CIA pushing this.
[01:27:39.227 --> 01:27:44.472]  Real intelligence experts looked at this and said, no, this is not intelligence.
[01:27:44.532 --> 01:27:45.472]  This is garbage.
[01:27:45.913 --> 01:27:46.874]  And they took it out.
[01:27:47.294 --> 01:28:02.447]  But in this process, the idea that they would include something like that in one of the great stellar intelligence assessments, as Mueller also found out, is highly questionable.
[01:28:02.807 --> 01:28:04.288]  Needs to be investigated.
[01:28:06.030 --> 01:28:07.091]  You know, I'm not one to
[01:28:10.063 --> 01:28:16.445]  Disrespect, let's say, people that deserve it, that are more experienced than me.
[01:28:16.805 --> 01:28:20.106]  But, I mean, what is Bob Woodward's deal?
[01:28:20.147 --> 01:28:22.527]  I mean, he really is strange in that interview.
[01:28:23.508 --> 01:28:28.009]  He says he just found out how the Steele dossier was used to try to destroy Trump.
[01:28:29.530 --> 01:28:34.191]  Bob, Earth to Bob, where have you been?
[01:28:35.152 --> 01:28:38.573]  Have you been in San Francisco huffing some street dung?
[01:28:40.185 --> 01:28:41.406]  You just found that out.
[01:28:41.907 --> 01:28:44.049]  Oh, and then he talks about how they had to remove it.
[01:28:44.469 --> 01:28:49.314]  Yeah, they had to remove it from their final report because they knew it was garbage and they know who paid for it.
[01:28:49.394 --> 01:28:52.056]  And they didn't want that on the final report.
[01:28:52.116 --> 01:28:52.897]  You get it, Bob?
[01:28:52.937 --> 01:28:54.479]  They're trying to cover up their crimes.
[01:28:54.519 --> 01:28:59.003]  But hey, I guess Bob does get it now because he's saying they should be investigated for their crimes.
[01:28:59.043 --> 01:28:59.944]  So way to go, Bob.
[01:28:59.984 --> 01:29:01.105]  You finally smelled the coffee.
[01:29:05.526 --> 01:29:06.527]  Samuel, thanks for calling.
[01:29:06.747 --> 01:29:08.249]  Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[01:29:08.309 --> 01:29:08.710]  Hello.
[01:29:08.850 --> 01:29:13.736]  Alex, if I can just quickly, InfoWarsStore.com, I want to thank you for Polnblock.
[01:29:13.836 --> 01:29:14.577]  It's amazing.
[01:29:14.697 --> 01:29:18.982]  I've used so many different antihistamines over the years because I get really bad hay fever.
[01:29:19.182 --> 01:29:23.487]  And the antihistamines sometimes work, sometimes don't, but they never quit.
[01:29:23.647 --> 01:29:26.409]  This is a known patent out of France.
[01:29:26.589 --> 01:29:37.316]  You have to pay for the patent, where they just discovered that if you feed a certain secret diet to quail, and then you get their eggs, it creates this incredible antihistamine of a certain type of quail.
[01:29:53.507 --> 01:29:56.728]  It's pretty much straight away, you know, in maybe 10 minutes, maybe 20 minutes.
[01:29:56.848 --> 01:29:57.568]  It just works.
[01:29:57.768 --> 01:30:08.311]  The antihistamines, the pharmaceutical products, I find that with those, I can't take them until I start getting symptoms, and even then, they might not kick in for half an hour, or they might not kick in at all, depending on the day.
[01:30:08.331 --> 01:30:10.892]  Pollen block works every single time.
[01:30:11.032 --> 01:30:12.112]  Well, that's the great part about this.
[01:30:12.192 --> 01:30:15.554]  And for whatever reason, France discovered it like 50 years ago.
[01:30:15.734 --> 01:30:17.874]  It's still got to be even in this region of France.
[01:30:17.934 --> 01:30:18.935]  It's very complex.
[01:30:18.955 --> 01:30:19.775]  They don't even know why.
[01:30:19.815 --> 01:30:23.116]  But they think it's the pollen in the area, the dust, what the quail are eating.
[01:30:23.696 --> 01:30:30.339]  Then they just produce in the eggs whatever this essence is that just turns the histamine response off.
[01:30:30.479 --> 01:30:32.179]  I go out and I do market research.
[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:34.800]  And I say, what are the best-selling products in the world?
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:36.301]  And what have the best reviews in the world?
[01:30:36.621 --> 01:30:44.769]  And then what do people in America not know that in Japan, or in Europe, or in Russia, or in Africa, or in Latin America, is already a bestseller?
[01:30:44.789 --> 01:30:46.431]  Because a lot of stuff never gets here for some reason.
[01:30:46.531 --> 01:30:51.736]  And in Europe, and in Russia, and in Canada, there are a lot of brands of this stuff with the quail eggs.
[01:30:52.277 --> 01:30:52.817]  It's not here.
[01:30:53.237 --> 01:30:56.681]  So we just made a souped-up version of it and discounted it, and it's Palm Block.
[01:30:56.741 --> 01:30:58.102]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139er.
[01:31:03.882 --> 01:31:14.929]  The Mueller Report, two years and countless hours, has concluded that there was no criminal conspiracy between members of the Trump team and the Russian government.
[01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:21.712]  The Attorney General did a grave disservice to the country by misrepresenting significant parts of the Mueller Report.
[01:31:21.853 --> 01:31:24.174]  This president is a double-digit obstructor.
[01:31:24.414 --> 01:31:33.081]  This was an investigation at its core about Donald Trump's daily, sometimes hourly, assault on the rule of law in this country.
[01:31:33.101 --> 01:31:42.248]  Attorney General Barr appears to have shown an unsettling willingness to undermine his own department in order to protect President Trump.
[01:31:42.448 --> 01:31:45.490]  He is basically a lackey and a sycophant.
[01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:47.652]  What's demonstrated
[01:31:49.847 --> 01:31:57.173]  In powerful and compelling detail in this report is nothing less than a national scandal.
[01:31:57.513 --> 01:32:00.176]  It's clear that our democracy has been compromised.
[01:32:00.356 --> 01:32:08.663]  This attorney general, the way he's been acting, it's not like he like showed up on day one and was surprised, oh Donald Trump is a train wreck when it comes to the presidency.
[01:32:08.723 --> 01:32:10.024]  He ran to that nuisance.
[01:33:06.454 --> 01:33:09.175]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.858 --> 01:33:22.020]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Owen Troyer.
[01:33:22.361 --> 01:33:25.182]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:45.162]  You know, I wasn't planning on covering the Sri Lanka bombings today.
[01:33:46.662 --> 01:33:51.744]  Alex covered it in the first hour, and it's just getting too much for me.
[01:33:53.144 --> 01:33:58.326]  And then I saw a couple news stories, and it just forced me to have to cover it here today.
[01:33:59.206 --> 01:34:05.428]  Now, first, here's an amazing thing, actually, before we get to that.
[01:34:06.733 --> 01:34:12.797]  And Mike Cernovich pointed this out on Twitter and others, but he combined a few stories here.
[01:34:13.357 --> 01:34:15.038]  So you have this story from Vice.
[01:34:16.059 --> 01:34:20.622]  The Jeffrey Epstein story is fanning the flames of far-right pedophilia panic.
[01:34:21.722 --> 01:34:23.203]  So apparently, according to Vice,
[01:34:25.095 --> 01:34:27.035]  Pedophilia panic is a bad thing.
[01:34:27.335 --> 01:34:30.316]  Not wanting pedophiles to exist.
[01:34:30.636 --> 01:34:32.576]  Not wanting pedophiles to rape children.
[01:34:32.636 --> 01:34:35.957]  Not wanting pedophiles to record child rape.
[01:34:36.077 --> 01:34:38.497]  Not wanting pedophiles to get their hands on children.
[01:34:38.777 --> 01:34:41.118]  Apparently, that's a bad thing to Vice.
[01:34:41.398 --> 01:34:44.518]  So, according to Vice, the far right is panicked over pedophilia.
[01:34:44.679 --> 01:34:45.279]  Oh my gosh!
[01:34:45.319 --> 01:34:45.959]  Like, wow!
[01:34:46.359 --> 01:34:47.059]  You got us!
[01:34:47.139 --> 01:34:48.599]  Like, you really got us, Vice!
[01:34:48.839 --> 01:34:49.199]  Oh my gosh!
[01:34:49.359 --> 01:34:50.680]  We don't like pedophilia, Vice!
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:52.640]  Oh, that's going to have us shut down now!
[01:34:55.859 --> 01:34:57.620]  So, okay.
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:34:59.640]  Doesn't stop there.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.001]  The Washington Post.
[01:35:01.301 --> 01:35:04.822]  Sri Lanka church bombing stoke far-right anger in the West.
[01:35:05.182 --> 01:35:05.902]  Oh my gosh!
[01:35:06.202 --> 01:35:09.463]  Conservatives are angry at terrorist bombings of churches!
[01:35:09.823 --> 01:35:11.304]  What is wrong with these people?
[01:35:12.722 --> 01:35:13.923]  That's Washington Post.
[01:35:14.203 --> 01:35:15.004]  Washington Post again.
[01:35:15.544 --> 01:35:19.088]  The Notre Dame fire ignites West's far right.
[01:35:19.548 --> 01:35:21.530]  I mean, look at conservatives in America!
[01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:22.951]  They don't like pedophiles!
[01:35:23.131 --> 01:35:24.212]  They don't like terrorists!
[01:35:24.492 --> 01:35:25.133]  Oh my gosh!
[01:35:25.493 --> 01:35:26.694]  What are we going to do?
[01:35:29.437 --> 01:35:32.399]  Because here's the sick, twisted thing about it.
[01:35:34.601 --> 01:35:36.523]  They're actually telling you who they've aligned with.
[01:35:37.912 --> 01:35:43.614]  They're telling you they've aligned with pedophiles, they've aligned with radical Islamic terror.
[01:35:44.654 --> 01:35:45.815]  They're openly telling you this!
[01:35:47.916 --> 01:35:50.677]  The far right is upset at pedophiles!
[01:35:50.837 --> 01:35:53.117]  The far right is upset against terrorism!
[01:35:53.718 --> 01:35:54.478]  Wow!
[01:35:55.138 --> 01:35:56.359]  You don't say!
[01:35:57.239 --> 01:35:57.859]  You're not?
[01:35:59.100 --> 01:35:59.380]  No!
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:00.680]  They've allied with it!
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:01.941]  You think that's rhetoric!
[01:36:02.161 --> 01:36:03.081]  You think that's a joke!
[01:36:03.461 --> 01:36:05.242]  They're now openly admitting it, folks!
[01:36:07.386 --> 01:36:08.366]  Just get used to it.
[01:36:09.667 --> 01:36:13.208]  So... So then you see this.
[01:36:16.489 --> 01:36:20.511]  Wisconsin mom of seven pleads guilty to trying to plot ISIS attacks.
[01:36:20.571 --> 01:36:23.132]  Now, this woman is clearly insane.
[01:36:24.052 --> 01:36:33.455]  Wahiba Issa Dais, 45, pled guilty to one count of providing material to support a terrorist group in exchange for another being dropped.
[01:36:34.115 --> 01:36:35.616]  So, she's, you know, an ISIS terrorist.
[01:36:36.653 --> 01:36:41.534]  Tried to bomb U.S.
[01:36:42.615 --> 01:36:42.955]  events.
[01:36:44.995 --> 01:36:46.216]  She's in Wisconsin.
[01:36:48.076 --> 01:36:48.836]  She's from Israel.
[01:36:50.997 --> 01:36:53.538]  And she made a deal with ISIS.
[01:36:56.198 --> 01:36:57.979]  She'll be facing at least 20 years.
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:02.300]  She promoted ISIS on social media.
[01:37:05.441 --> 01:37:05.721]  And so,
[01:37:06.926 --> 01:37:09.409]  You won't see this story anywhere, though.
[01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:16.817]  In fact, I wouldn't even have seen this, and I'm a total news junkie, except that the crew brought it to me.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:26.848]  So, she tried to plot ISIS terror attacks, stories in the Daily Mail, and... no news coverage.
[01:37:27.970 --> 01:37:29.591]  Nothing on television news.
[01:37:29.672 --> 01:37:36.037]  Now, if this was a... Let's just say this was a Christian plotting for the Church of Latter-day Saints.
[01:37:36.057 --> 01:37:38.519]  Of course, this never happened as far as I know.
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:50.789]  But let's just, you know, hypothetically say this was a Christian, Church of Latter-day Saints, and she was planning a Church of Latter-day Saints bombing of Muslim mosques.
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:52.541]  Do you think that would be big news?
[01:37:52.621 --> 01:37:53.382]  I think it'd be big news.
[01:37:53.502 --> 01:37:54.403]  I think CNN would run with it.
[01:37:54.543 --> 01:37:55.664]  I think MSNBC would run with it.
[01:37:55.884 --> 01:37:56.905]  I think the New York Times would run with it.
[01:37:57.005 --> 01:37:58.146]  I think the Washington Post would run with it.
[01:37:59.507 --> 01:38:01.929]  Oh yeah, a Christian terrorist arrested.
[01:38:01.989 --> 01:38:03.371]  These Christians are out of control.
[01:38:03.531 --> 01:38:04.872]  Look at the Islamophobia!
[01:38:05.412 --> 01:38:07.795]  Oh, but no, that's not what happened, right?
[01:38:08.135 --> 01:38:13.640]  What happened was it was a Wisconsin woman who tried to plot ISIS terror attacks.
[01:38:15.181 --> 01:38:15.842]  That's what it was.
[01:38:16.843 --> 01:38:17.803]  So they didn't cover it.
[01:38:18.578 --> 01:38:19.319]  And they won't cover it.
[01:38:19.879 --> 01:38:23.002]  I'll be stunned if I see this story anywhere tonight.
[01:38:23.623 --> 01:38:24.003]  Stunned!
[01:38:24.724 --> 01:38:32.731]  But here is the local report from Wisconsin on Wahiba Issa Dais.
[01:38:34.227 --> 01:38:37.831]  FBI agents traced those videos to the Cudahy home of Waheba Dace.
[01:38:37.971 --> 01:38:47.521]  According to her plea deal, Dace unknowingly suggested to an undercover agent possible targets for attacks, including street festivals, summer celebrations, and even churches.
[01:38:47.762 --> 01:38:51.646]  With regards to target selection, any indication that any targets were here in Wisconsin?
[01:38:52.206 --> 01:38:53.167]  I can't comment on that.
[01:38:53.207 --> 01:38:53.907]  I'm not aware of that.
[01:38:54.367 --> 01:39:02.892]  The agent told Dace they had no experience in bomb making and records show Dace replied, no problem, making bombs is easy and you can also start with poisons.
[01:39:03.312 --> 01:39:07.735]  Dace and another Milwaukee man pleaded guilty in unrelated ISIS cases on Monday.
[01:39:07.955 --> 01:39:15.519]  Can you say whether with these plea agreements if individuals are cooperating with law enforcement now to help you all develop new cases?
[01:39:16.059 --> 01:39:26.141]  I can't comment on that, but I can tell you that the Joint Terrorism Task Force is working around the clock to follow up on leads and do whatever it can to try to keep the community safe.
[01:39:26.661 --> 01:39:29.982]  The plea comes one day after a series of attacks in Sri Lanka.
[01:39:30.302 --> 01:39:36.883]  And although there's been no claim of responsibility, it's the same kind of violence Dace encouraged ISIS followers to carry out.
[01:39:37.003 --> 01:39:44.925]  We do know that it was the result of hate, a propensity towards violence, and an intolerance towards the belief of others.
[01:39:46.553 --> 01:39:48.034]  Derek, let's talk about her punishment.
[01:39:48.094 --> 01:39:49.974]  What kind of prison time is she facing now?
[01:39:49.994 --> 01:39:56.097]  20 years in federal prison, Patrick, as well as as much as a $250,000 fine.
[01:39:56.217 --> 01:39:59.278]  Her sentencing is scheduled for September.
[01:39:59.418 --> 01:40:06.081]  Now just imagine, this woman is actively recruiting people to carry out terrorism for ISIS on social media.
[01:40:06.561 --> 01:40:08.322]  Not censored, not banned.
[01:40:10.803 --> 01:40:11.743]  Now how do you measure that?
[01:40:16.058 --> 01:40:17.299]  How do you analyze that?
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:21.441]  Boy, Facebook is real quick to shut down a conservative they don't like.
[01:40:22.062 --> 01:40:33.109]  Boy, these social media giants, they got their finger on the pulse of the conservatives out there waiting for them to take one wrong move, one wrong step, one wrong tweet, and they're gone.
[01:40:34.469 --> 01:40:38.312]  Oh, but this woman recruiting for ISIS, she's good to go.
[01:40:39.235 --> 01:40:40.537]  And this is just one example.
[01:40:40.617 --> 01:40:44.402]  I mean, you could probably find a dozen stories easily.
[01:40:44.422 --> 01:40:52.532]  Probably not on Google, but you could find a dozen stories about how Facebook and Twitter and social media has been used to recruit for ISIS.
[01:40:52.953 --> 01:40:53.333]  Yeah!
[01:40:53.994 --> 01:40:54.715]  Oh yeah!
[01:40:55.776 --> 01:40:56.057]  Oh, but...
[01:40:57.008 --> 01:41:02.072]  You know, that InfoWars that talks about restoring American independence.
[01:41:02.112 --> 01:41:05.254]  That InfoWars that talks about stopping pedophiles.
[01:41:05.294 --> 01:41:08.216]  That InfoWars that talks about stopping terrorists.
[01:41:08.256 --> 01:41:10.157]  That InfoWars that wants to have a southern border.
[01:41:10.557 --> 01:41:12.339]  You gotta shut those extremists down.
[01:41:12.959 --> 01:41:14.420]  You gotta shut that hate down.
[01:41:16.181 --> 01:41:18.043]  Oh, that pedophilic content on YouTube?
[01:41:18.303 --> 01:41:19.283]  That's good to stay.
[01:41:19.844 --> 01:41:20.144]  Yeah.
[01:41:20.524 --> 01:41:23.106]  That woman recruiting terrorists on Facebook?
[01:41:23.727 --> 01:41:25.268]  Oh yeah, keep that for sure.
[01:41:26.539 --> 01:41:32.325]  All the garbage that's put out on Twitter from inciting violence to pornography and all that?
[01:41:32.525 --> 01:41:34.047]  Oh yeah, keep that up there.
[01:41:34.127 --> 01:41:35.148]  That's good for ratings.
[01:41:35.188 --> 01:41:36.029]  That's good for clicks.
[01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:37.351]  But InfoWars?
[01:41:37.611 --> 01:41:38.051]  No.
[01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:41.602]  We can't have that extremism.
[01:41:42.302 --> 01:41:43.804]  We can't have that intolerance.
[01:41:44.925 --> 01:41:47.727]  Oh, but yes, that mass shooting in New Zealand.
[01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:50.650]  Let's stream that live and let's keep that up for a couple hours.
[01:41:50.690 --> 01:41:51.291]  That's good.
[01:41:51.911 --> 01:41:53.413]  Oh, that InfoWars broadcast?
[01:41:53.673 --> 01:41:54.974]  Shut that down immediately.
[01:41:55.495 --> 01:41:56.356]  That's dangerous.
[01:41:57.836 --> 01:41:59.437]  Oh, that woman recruiting for ISIS?
[01:41:59.977 --> 01:42:00.258]  Hmm.
[01:42:00.518 --> 01:42:01.418]  We didn't notice her.
[01:42:01.438 --> 01:42:02.739]  Yeah, no.
[01:42:02.759 --> 01:42:04.280]  We must have missed her.
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:10.624]  We were too busy following conservatives waiting to censor the next conservative that we saw engage in hate speech.
[01:42:10.984 --> 01:42:13.045]  That's what we really need to stop.
[01:42:13.306 --> 01:42:13.966]  Not terror.
[01:42:16.548 --> 01:42:17.528]  But this is the reality.
[01:42:17.568 --> 01:42:19.289]  I mean, you think I'm joking.
[01:42:19.329 --> 01:42:20.510]  You think this is a joke.
[01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:22.511]  You think I'm up here being facetious.
[01:42:22.611 --> 01:42:22.912]  No!
[01:42:23.392 --> 01:42:25.253]  That's actually what's happening.
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:37.309]  But don't worry, because now the BBC, folks, frets over nervous and afraid Muslims following Islamic terror attacks in Sri Lanka.
[01:42:37.690 --> 01:42:42.655]  So Muslims go blow up a bunch of Christians in Sri Lanka, and what does the media say?
[01:42:42.675 --> 01:42:43.996]  The poor Muslims!
[01:42:49.761 --> 01:42:52.803]  It's like, you know, a Drag Queen story hour.
[01:42:53.144 --> 01:43:00.669]  Drag Queen gets caught as a convicted pedophile groping a kid and we kick it out of the library and mainstream media says, how dare you kick that pedophile out?
[01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:01.310]  What's wrong with you?
[01:43:03.618 --> 01:43:10.383]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[01:43:10.983 --> 01:43:13.545]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[01:43:14.085 --> 01:43:17.848]  And I'll tell you like it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[01:43:18.368 --> 01:43:19.329]  You're our only sponsors.
[01:43:19.849 --> 01:43:25.893]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[01:43:26.333 --> 01:43:28.235]  So remember, you are the InfoWarp.
[01:43:28.815 --> 01:43:29.516]  I'm not the leader.
[01:43:29.836 --> 01:43:30.437]  You are the leader.
[01:43:30.637 --> 01:43:32.218]  When you take action, nothing stops you.

[01:44:54.193 --> 01:44:57.235]  Available at Infowarslife.com today.
[01:44:57.255 --> 01:45:04.901]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:45:04.961 --> 01:45:06.762]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:45:06.882 --> 01:45:07.262]  It is!
[01:45:07.462 --> 01:45:09.023]  But if you took it with fish oil...
[01:45:10.306 --> 01:45:11.868]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[01:45:12.348 --> 01:45:13.569]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:45:13.690 --> 01:45:15.431]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:45:15.511 --> 01:45:17.834]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:45:17.994 --> 01:45:19.555]  Brain, body, heart.
[01:45:19.635 --> 01:45:21.017]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[01:45:21.077 --> 01:45:22.318]  You've got the children's.
[01:45:22.458 --> 01:45:23.419]  You've got the adults.
[01:45:23.559 --> 01:45:24.480]  You've got the krill oil.
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:27.944]  If you're gonna get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[01:45:27.964 --> 01:45:30.326]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[01:45:30.546 --> 01:45:31.727]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:45:31.887 --> 01:45:32.568]  And I'm sorry.
[01:45:32.648 --> 01:45:33.649]  You want something like this?
[01:45:33.749 --> 01:45:34.609]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:36.571]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:45:36.651 --> 01:45:37.171]  It's so good.
[01:45:37.232 --> 01:45:37.772]  In my view.
[01:45:37.852 --> 01:45:39.854]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:45:39.894 --> 01:45:44.518]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:45:46.279 --> 01:45:50.843]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:45:53.789 --> 01:45:59.612]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:45:59.692 --> 01:46:00.612]  I just can't do it!
[01:46:02.673 --> 01:46:05.814]  BrainForce Plus is a top-tier nootropin.
[01:46:06.575 --> 01:46:07.015]  Focus.
[01:46:07.775 --> 01:46:08.296]  Clarity.
[01:46:08.736 --> 01:46:09.056]  Energy.
[01:46:09.696 --> 01:46:14.098]  But instead of having a 7x markup, we have a 150% markup.
[01:46:15.139 --> 01:46:17.360]  Right now, it's massively discounted.
[01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:22.142]  And when you get a bottle of it at 25% off, you get a free bottle.
[01:46:22.722 --> 01:46:24.204]  of what is our total bestseller.
[01:46:24.604 --> 01:46:28.469]  It's not very profitable because we give it at such a low price, but it's amazing.
[01:46:28.689 --> 01:46:31.052]  And that, of course, is Knockout, the ultimate sleep aid.
[01:46:31.353 --> 01:46:37.620]  So we've got a way to energize you, ramp you up in a healthy way during the day, and put you deep into that restful, healthy sleep at night.
[01:46:38.141 --> 01:46:41.245]  It's the BrainForce and Knockout combo deal.
[01:46:41.465 --> 01:46:43.066]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:15.094 --> 01:47:39.755]  Turn me on, I'm alive tonight Out on the streets again Turn me on, I'm a hotshot Something you'll never forget
[01:47:40.197 --> 01:47:42.359]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:42.619 --> 01:47:44.701]  Owen Schroer here filling in for Alex.
[01:47:44.781 --> 01:47:50.705]  He is on a secret mission that you will soon see the results of at InfoWars.com.
[01:47:52.830 --> 01:48:00.276]  I want to continue on the road that we were on before I get into some of the other giant news that I haven't even gotten to here today.
[01:48:00.376 --> 01:48:07.202]  In fact, I'm amazed that I haven't gotten to some of this massive news, but we'll get to it in the third hour.
[01:48:07.563 --> 01:48:09.424]  And Dan Lyman also joins me in the third hour.
[01:48:09.905 --> 01:48:13.167]  But let's kind of put a bookend and finish off what we were just talking about.
[01:48:14.727 --> 01:48:30.100]  Again, I didn't want to get into this because it kind of is like the identity politics crap and it's just so redundant and I'm just so sick of it, but I see the lies and I see the blatant attack on Christianity or, you know, and I just don't get it.
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:36.365]  So it's like, look, if they want to demonize Christianity, if they want to act like it doesn't exist, then we have to be here to say, hey, we love God.
[01:48:36.565 --> 01:48:37.346]  We love Christ.
[01:48:37.586 --> 01:48:38.907]  Jesus Christ is the Messiah.
[01:48:39.728 --> 01:48:41.129]  We're not Easter worshipers.
[01:48:41.149 --> 01:48:42.390]  That's a made up thing.
[01:48:42.510 --> 01:48:43.691]  That's literally made up.
[01:48:44.983 --> 01:48:46.684]  Oh, but they'll say Muslims all day long.
[01:48:46.724 --> 01:48:49.284]  They'll say Islam is the religion of peace all day long.
[01:48:49.304 --> 01:48:50.885]  They'll say Islamophobia all day long.
[01:48:51.465 --> 01:48:55.246]  Oh, but don't mention the Christians getting their heads lopped off by radical Islam.
[01:48:55.527 --> 01:48:59.188]  Don't mention the Christians that this had their legs blown off by radical Islam.
[01:48:59.648 --> 01:49:05.930]  Oh, and now they're saying that the Sri Lanka attacks were a response to the New Zealand mosque massacre.
[01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:07.391]  That was a troll!
[01:49:07.611 --> 01:49:09.011]  That was a false flag!
[01:49:12.512 --> 01:49:14.493]  So who even knows what the hell's going on?
[01:49:18.376 --> 01:49:23.481]  But, look, there's little tells.
[01:49:23.501 --> 01:49:30.808]  And I covered one earlier about, in the last segment, about how they've aligned with pedophiles and they've aligned with radical Islam.
[01:49:30.828 --> 01:49:36.474]  And that's why they say we're far-right extremists because we don't like pedophiles and Islamic terror.
[01:49:36.494 --> 01:49:38.816]  I mean, you know, because that's a real black eye on us.
[01:49:38.896 --> 01:49:39.697]  Like, oh my gosh!
[01:49:43.781 --> 01:49:48.362]  You see the blatant Google not ever putting anything Easter on their search engine.
[01:49:49.923 --> 01:49:52.364]  All these Democrats not even mentioning Christians.
[01:49:52.584 --> 01:49:54.784]  They say Easter worshippers, something that doesn't even exist.
[01:49:54.844 --> 01:49:55.424]  It's all fake news.
[01:49:55.665 --> 01:50:03.467]  And you know, again, I got into this a little bit yesterday on The War Room, which by the way, Will Johnson hosting The War Room today, 3 to 6 Central, for me at InfoWars.com slash show.
[01:50:04.407 --> 01:50:10.829]  Folks, I just like, I don't even want to get into this because it's so unbelievable, but I mean, it's almost too unbelievable.
[01:50:11.813 --> 01:50:22.276]  And I landed that it's fake, but there's a picture of Michelle Obama drinking champagne, allegedly on the river, floating by, doing a river float, floating by as the Notre Dame Cathedral is burning.
[01:50:22.316 --> 01:50:36.500]  Now look, when you know what's going on, and you know how deep the corruption is, and how enslaved humanity has been, just, just, not physical shackles, but mental shackles, it's not that far-fetched.
[01:50:37.213 --> 01:50:41.275]  That Manchell Obama would be floating by Notre Dame as it's burning.
[01:50:41.315 --> 01:50:43.615]  This was clearly... Let me look.
[01:50:44.536 --> 01:50:50.018]  The whole Illuminati thing has just been used up now and it's almost like there's no value in saying it.
[01:50:50.038 --> 01:50:50.298]  But no.
[01:50:51.178 --> 01:50:52.119]  There are secret societies.
[01:50:52.139 --> 01:50:53.099]  There are Satan societies.
[01:50:53.139 --> 01:50:54.219]  They are worldwide.
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:55.740]  There's global secret networks.
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:58.401]  There's global combines that can pull off false flags.
[01:50:58.561 --> 01:50:59.441]  They have no flag.
[01:50:59.722 --> 01:51:00.022]  You get it?
[01:51:01.021 --> 01:51:02.842]  There is no flag for the secret societies.
[01:51:02.962 --> 01:51:04.403]  They don't really exist.
[01:51:04.663 --> 01:51:10.147]  So they can go off and burn anything and start anything and then have everybody pointing at everybody else who did the false flag.
[01:51:10.327 --> 01:51:11.447]  They have no flag!
[01:51:12.348 --> 01:51:14.069]  And so they can do events like this.
[01:51:16.451 --> 01:51:17.731]  Some people know what's going on.
[01:51:19.553 --> 01:51:20.053]  But for real.
[01:51:21.474 --> 01:51:22.074]  Show the picture.
[01:51:22.094 --> 01:51:25.036]  I mean, this can't be real.
[01:51:25.356 --> 01:51:27.038]  It can't be that bad, right?
[01:51:27.778 --> 01:51:36.023]  It can't be that bad that Michelle Obama is actually floating by Notre Dame Cathedral as it's burning, toasting champagne to it.
[01:51:36.323 --> 01:51:37.844]  It can't be that bad, can it?
[01:51:39.645 --> 01:51:41.947]  Oh, but it can be that bad.
[01:51:44.628 --> 01:51:46.930]  And I wanted to get to this Tucker Carlson clip, but it's just like,
[01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:55.352]  TMZ puts out the picture and people look at the wine glass and they think it's Notre Dame Cathedral burning behind it!
[01:51:57.033 --> 01:51:58.113]  And she's on a cruise!
[01:51:59.294 --> 01:52:00.014]  Floating by!
[01:52:00.034 --> 01:52:03.335]  I mean, can you imagine, though?
[01:52:03.375 --> 01:52:04.656]  I mean, folks, let me just put it to you this way.
[01:52:06.736 --> 01:52:18.321]  Because... I just... Because I don't want to do a, you know, what if it's true, but it's like...
[01:52:19.872 --> 01:52:21.113]  I mean, people are talking about it.
[01:52:21.193 --> 01:52:22.574]  It's like, we're not allowed to talk about it?
[01:52:25.796 --> 01:52:34.282]  The world's most famous cross-dresser toasting to Notre Dame burn.
[01:52:35.543 --> 01:52:36.864]  To Notre Dame burning to the ground.
[01:52:39.066 --> 01:52:41.828]  Now, you look at everything else that's going on, that's just par for the course.
[01:52:42.988 --> 01:52:45.010]  But people think that
[01:52:46.127 --> 01:53:00.311]  Michelle Obama drinking champagne as she cruises by Notre Dame Cathedral burning is a sign that it was a secret society event, a Satan, a Satanist pagan sacrifice.
[01:53:02.232 --> 01:53:14.896]  And I'll tell you something else, if they rebuild that and it is, let's just say, globalist symbolism, well that just makes it all look that more suspicious.
[01:53:16.786 --> 01:53:19.207]  But you see, you're not allowed to be a victim if you're a Christian.
[01:53:19.387 --> 01:53:24.169]  In fact, the Notre Dame Cathedral burning is somehow bad for Muslims, I'm sure.
[01:53:24.489 --> 01:53:26.830]  I mean, I feel bad for the Muslims that the Christians are blowing up.
[01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:28.590]  I mean, that's literally the BBC.
[01:53:29.450 --> 01:53:35.232]  So Muslims go up and blow up 300 Christians in Sri Lanka, and the BBC says, oh my gosh, the poor Muslims!
[01:53:35.973 --> 01:53:36.353]  Literally!
[01:53:37.093 --> 01:53:38.334]  But you know what?
[01:53:38.794 --> 01:53:44.936]  Let's go to Tucker Carlson, who breaks it down last night, why the left won't say Christians.
[01:53:46.647 --> 01:53:48.748]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight.
[01:53:48.928 --> 01:53:53.830]  The holiest day of the Christian calendar turned to tragedy yesterday, as you know, in Sri Lanka.
[01:53:54.390 --> 01:54:01.132]  In a series of coordinated attacks, suicide bombers struck three Catholic churches as well as hotels in cities across the country.
[01:54:01.593 --> 01:54:04.594]  Oh, and by the way, they found multiple unexploded devices as well.
[01:54:05.214 --> 01:54:08.856]  Sri Lankan authorities say the attackers were affiliated with a local terror group.
[01:54:09.396 --> 01:54:11.157]  The attackers were radical Muslims.
[01:54:11.478 --> 01:54:12.778]  Their motives were religious.
[01:54:12.838 --> 01:54:14.099]  Their targets were Christians.
[01:54:14.619 --> 01:54:16.501]  None of that is speculation.
[01:54:16.581 --> 01:54:16.981]  It's true.
[01:54:17.705 --> 01:54:21.967]  Maybe because it is so true, and so obviously true, nobody in authority wanted to say it out loud.
[01:54:22.007 --> 01:54:25.610]  So instead, they went to great lengths to avoid clear language.
[01:54:25.970 --> 01:54:32.353]  Quote, the attacks on tourists and Easter worshipers in Sri Lanka are an attack on humanity, tweeted Barack Obama.
[01:54:32.934 --> 01:54:34.495]  Hillary Clinton used the same awkward phrase.
[01:54:34.815 --> 01:54:40.858]  I'm praying for everyone affected by today's horrific attack on Easter worshipers and travelers in Sri Lanka, she wrote.
[01:54:41.739 --> 01:54:42.519]  Easter worshipers?
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:44.380]  Why don't you say Christians?
[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:45.261]  Nobody worships Easter.
[01:54:47.998 --> 01:54:48.899]  I need to explain something.
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:55.663]  And this is the kind of stuff that we talk about here where like actual intelligence people listen and they're like, okay.
[01:54:56.724 --> 01:54:58.525]  I mean, there's a reason.
[01:54:58.585 --> 01:55:01.627]  It's not a coincidence that they're all putting out Easter worshipers, folks.
[01:55:01.707 --> 01:55:04.869]  That's them sending out a signal.
[01:55:06.070 --> 01:55:08.671]  That's them sending out a signal.
[01:55:09.292 --> 01:55:12.374]  We are allied with radical Islam.
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:14.360]  That's what they're doing.
[01:55:14.701 --> 01:55:16.221]  They don't care about people blowing up.
[01:55:16.241 --> 01:55:17.382]  They're not even tweeting about that.
[01:55:17.802 --> 01:55:22.124]  They're sending out a signal to all the people they can't talk to right now, because they're all being monitored.
[01:55:22.345 --> 01:55:23.945]  They're all being investigated right now.
[01:55:24.266 --> 01:55:28.708]  They can't communicate with all their cohorts, so they have to do it all in signals.
[01:55:28.968 --> 01:55:30.249]  They have to put out beacons!
[01:55:30.489 --> 01:55:33.950]  They're saying, no, we're still allied with you, Radical Islam!
[01:55:34.090 --> 01:55:35.271]  We just can't talk to you anymore!
[01:55:35.431 --> 01:55:36.531]  We just can't communicate with you!
[01:55:36.691 --> 01:55:38.012]  The people we've been arming in the Middle East!
[01:55:38.152 --> 01:55:39.533]  The people that we've been sending weapons to!
[01:55:39.693 --> 01:55:41.073]  The people that we literally give cash to!
[01:55:41.253 --> 01:55:41.934]  It's all on record!
[01:55:42.194 --> 01:55:47.056]  Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have been colluding with Radical Islam for ten frickin' years!
[01:55:47.216 --> 01:55:48.737]  But they can't communicate with them anymore!
[01:55:49.497 --> 01:55:50.518]  Because they're being investigated!
[01:55:50.739 --> 01:55:52.421]  So they're sending out signals on Twitter!
[01:55:52.801 --> 01:55:53.402]  Easter Worshippers!
[01:55:53.502 --> 01:55:54.083]  Easter Worshippers!
[01:55:54.423 --> 01:55:55.685]  It's all signals, folks!
[01:55:55.865 --> 01:55:57.667]  They're telling you who they are!
[01:55:57.948 --> 01:56:00.611]  They are engaged in such massive treason!
[01:56:02.073 --> 01:56:02.894]  Just go back to the clip.
[01:56:04.042 --> 01:56:06.424]  ...reason, of course, euphemisms are never accidental.
[01:56:06.924 --> 01:56:09.105]  Our leaders believe Christians are the problem.
[01:56:09.145 --> 01:56:10.366]  They're the dangerous ones.
[01:56:10.746 --> 01:56:11.727]  They can't be trusted.
[01:56:12.207 --> 01:56:17.791]  Tell them the truth and they might go crazy and organize a new crusade and sheath their swords and march on Jerusalem.
[01:56:17.891 --> 01:56:19.112]  You never know with Christians.
[01:56:20.052 --> 01:56:27.077]  Just tonight, the Washington Post ran a story with this headline, quote, Sri Lanka church bombing stoke far-right anger in West.
[01:56:28.021 --> 01:56:31.263]  As if you'd have to be some kind of Nazi to be upset about church bombings.
[01:56:31.503 --> 01:56:32.383]  That's what they seem to think.
[01:56:32.904 --> 01:56:33.704]  No, that's it!
[01:56:33.724 --> 01:56:36.145]  ...consistently ignore the persecution of Christians around the world.
[01:56:36.165 --> 01:56:36.886]  So go ahead and pull it down.
[01:56:36.926 --> 01:56:44.730]  We already heard this in the first hour, but it's so important because, again, I didn't even want to talk about this today, but it's so obvious what's going on, and no one else is going to talk about it.
[01:56:45.770 --> 01:56:55.095]  And so, you remember the story last week about the kid that got shoved off the balcony at the Mall of Minnesota?
[01:56:56.203 --> 01:57:03.665]  Well, did you notice how the media started running cover for that story immediately saying that the child fell or that the child plunged?
[01:57:03.825 --> 01:57:05.546]  They didn't say pushed, shoved, dropped.
[01:57:05.646 --> 01:57:06.126]  No, no, no.
[01:57:06.266 --> 01:57:07.206]  They were covering immediately.
[01:57:07.606 --> 01:57:09.647]  Boy, that's telling you something, isn't it?
[01:57:10.007 --> 01:57:13.788]  They don't want you to know who this guy was that pushed her off or that pushed the boy off.
[01:57:14.148 --> 01:57:16.769]  They don't want you to know who he is or why he did it.
[01:57:19.290 --> 01:57:22.451]  Now, they're claiming that he did it because he was sexually frustrated.
[01:57:24.795 --> 01:57:29.699]  But when they start running headlines, boy plunges from balcony, boy falls off balcony.
[01:57:29.759 --> 01:57:33.241]  When the kid was clearly pushed, dropped from the balcony for a reason.
[01:57:33.321 --> 01:57:35.222]  I mean, you know, you see what's going on here?
[01:57:35.303 --> 01:57:38.064]  And it just happens to be at the Mall in Minnesota, Ilhan Omar's district.
[01:57:38.084 --> 01:57:41.147]  So, you know, it's just unbelievable.
[01:57:41.207 --> 01:57:50.373]  Oh, by the way, we'll get to this, but you know, Jussie Smollett, as InfoWars predicted, is now saying he was assaulted by MAGA supporters.
[01:57:50.393 --> 01:57:51.174]  They're still going with it.
[01:57:54.011 --> 01:58:00.954]  Let me just tell listeners about something that is the very best product for your telomeres, for your mitochondrial DNA.
[01:58:01.134 --> 01:58:02.894]  That's the antioxidant that's next level.
[01:58:03.095 --> 01:58:11.898]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, the amount of it in here, depending on the equation, something like 40 boxes of the same chemical that's naturally occurring in blueberries.
[01:58:12.078 --> 01:58:12.798]  It's ridiculous.
[01:58:12.918 --> 01:58:13.459]  The CoQ10, PPQ,
[01:58:14.619 --> 01:58:17.880]  We have the organically derived, and by that, it's not synthetic.
[01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:23.543]  Most of the stuff that you see on the shelves, a tiny bottle of PQQ or CoQ10, will be like 50 bucks, because even the synthetic's expensive.
[01:58:23.623 --> 01:58:25.724]  This is the organically derived.
[01:58:26.144 --> 01:58:27.044]  This is the real stuff.
[01:58:27.244 --> 01:58:37.128]  I want to warn you, when I first started taking it five years ago, and this is DNA Force Plus, when I cut my finger off like 15 years ago, they reattached the finger, and you can see that right there, we're cut off.
[01:58:37.349 --> 01:58:38.689]  It was hanging by a piece of skin right here.
[01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:40.390]  It doesn't cut cleanly like you see in the movies.
[01:58:40.990 --> 01:58:41.830]  And then tore it off.
[01:58:42.111 --> 01:58:43.531]  It was numb all the way up here.
[01:58:43.691 --> 01:58:45.833]  And the strangest thing is I started taking DNA force.
[01:58:46.033 --> 01:58:47.594]  The feeling came back in my finger.
[01:58:47.634 --> 01:58:49.114]  First it tingled and it came back.
[01:58:49.315 --> 01:58:50.395]  I was like, this is incredible.
[01:58:50.475 --> 01:58:51.276]  But I'm going to warn you.
[01:58:51.476 --> 01:58:56.018]  Most people that have old injuries and where nerves have kind of died out, this isn't just regenerating your cells.
[01:58:56.198 --> 01:58:59.960]  This isn't just slowing the shrinkage of telomeres, which is the same thing as making them last longer.
[01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:02.462]  It really does regenerate nerves in many areas.
[01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:04.483]  So it's the building blocks.
[01:59:04.783 --> 01:59:05.683]  And it's the next level.
[01:59:05.723 --> 01:59:06.664]  It's the best you're going to get.
[01:59:06.784 --> 01:59:09.545]  I remember saying, what's the top selling thing like six years ago?
[01:59:09.586 --> 01:59:10.366]  We're getting into supplements.
[01:59:10.606 --> 01:59:12.448]  And well, it's PQQ and CoQ10.
[01:59:12.588 --> 01:59:17.774]  But mainly, people at grocery stores don't want to pay that, so they buy synthetic stuff that's still 50, 60 bucks for a little bottle.
[01:59:17.974 --> 01:59:22.480]  But at medical clinics, it's not prescription, but people are willing to pay, you know, 300, 400 bucks.
[01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:23.501]  That's a 6, 7 times markup.
[01:59:25.503 --> 01:59:26.043]  Let's do it!
[01:59:55.481 --> 02:00:01.425]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.569 --> 02:00:11.072]  Folks,
[02:00:23.271 --> 02:00:37.443]  Trump needs to understand if he does not move against these deep state criminals before 2020, A, it's not, I mean, he could probably still win, but it's not going to be as easy.
[02:00:37.523 --> 02:00:39.084]  And nothing is guaranteed either way.
[02:00:39.384 --> 02:00:46.650]  So he needs to move against these people now while he's still the president and before they become even more unhinged and they get violent.
[02:00:47.031 --> 02:00:48.512]  Here's Alex Jones breaking it down.
[02:00:48.532 --> 02:00:51.935]  They're telling us we're in the post-male and female era.
[02:00:52.892 --> 02:00:54.894]  This is the world where the beta cucks rule.
[02:00:55.634 --> 02:00:57.076]  Well, not so fast.
[02:00:57.316 --> 02:00:58.497]  I've known him for 30 years.
[02:00:58.737 --> 02:01:01.219]  He's one of the finest lawyers this country has ever produced.
[02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:03.742]  He came back out of retirement to serve this country.
[02:01:04.002 --> 02:01:09.947]  There's not one shred of evidence that anything he said either the other day or now or today was a lie.
[02:01:10.248 --> 02:01:12.570]  Don't ever say that in front of me about Bill Barr.
[02:01:13.010 --> 02:01:14.712]  You have no evidence that he lied.
[02:01:14.972 --> 02:01:15.512]  And you know it.
[02:01:15.532 --> 02:01:18.955]  But I'm telling you... You said he may have lied.
[02:01:19.856 --> 02:01:26.379]  What I'm telling you is that what he said today in the press conference is inconsistent with what's in the report.
[02:01:26.399 --> 02:01:27.740]  That's not a lie!
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:28.940]  Okay, fine.
[02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:30.261]  It's not fine.
[02:01:30.361 --> 02:01:33.382]  You're on national television calling the Attorney General a liar.
[02:01:33.863 --> 02:01:34.663]  I didn't say that.
[02:01:34.683 --> 02:01:36.584]  You suggested it very strongly.
[02:01:36.604 --> 02:01:37.984]  Alright, I think we're done here.
[02:01:38.104 --> 02:01:38.805]  I think we are.
[02:01:38.825 --> 02:01:42.046]  When they're the traitors selling out the country, they're the globalists.
[02:01:42.186 --> 02:01:47.769]  And then they turn around and say people that love this country have nothing but records of standing up for it.
[02:01:49.582 --> 02:01:51.343]  That we're the ones that have to be watched.
[02:01:51.723 --> 02:02:01.766]  How do you flip the script when you're a bunch of traitorous globalists who want to get rid of the country, and say you want to get rid of it, and are collapsing its borders and fighting the president trying to defend the borders?
[02:02:03.567 --> 02:02:08.208]  What do you do to try to put that in check when it's so obvious you're the enemy?
[02:02:09.409 --> 02:02:13.790]  Of the unborn, and the born, and the left wants to euthanize old people.
[02:02:14.050 --> 02:02:15.331]  I mean, they're just villains!
[02:02:16.638 --> 02:02:19.541]  Counselor, thank you very much for joining us.
[02:02:20.221 --> 02:02:25.205]  My first question, I'm afraid, is going to verge on plain English.
[02:02:25.726 --> 02:02:33.372]  Where did the Attorney General get off with that characterization this morning, including four mentions that there was no collusion?
[02:02:33.893 --> 02:02:37.376]  What document was he reading compared to the one we're left with?
[02:02:37.876 --> 02:02:45.964]  Well, page 2 of the document says, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election of interference activities.
[02:02:45.984 --> 02:02:47.586]  In its election of interference activities.
[02:02:47.606 --> 02:02:49.507]  So it's right from the document itself.
[02:02:49.908 --> 02:02:51.249]  Have you read part 1?
[02:02:51.289 --> 02:02:53.351]  I have read part 1 and part 2.
[02:02:53.391 --> 02:02:57.195]  Do you find good news in here for the president and the administration?
[02:02:57.595 --> 02:03:10.564]  The investigation did not, page 181, the investigation did not establish that the contacts described in volume one, that's the Russian contacts, amounted to an agreement to commit any violation of federal criminal law, including foreign influence and campaign finance laws.
[02:03:10.584 --> 02:03:11.665]  Yeah, I think it's a very good win.
[02:03:13.342 --> 02:03:16.263]  Teaching people that if you want to get ahead, somebody else has to lose.
[02:03:17.064 --> 02:03:19.625]  Instead of building economies that are about really taking care of people.
[02:03:19.905 --> 02:03:24.667]  Because the criminals that did all this are walking free, and are so arrogant.
[02:03:24.767 --> 02:03:28.428]  They're calling for new investigations, and new congressional witch hunts.
[02:03:29.409 --> 02:03:32.150]  And they're up on their hind legs, more arrogant than ever.
[02:03:32.410 --> 02:03:34.151]  Saying this is a blueprint for impeachment.
[02:03:35.333 --> 02:03:37.595]  And proof of the Russian takeover?
[02:03:38.396 --> 02:03:40.477]  Pay attention to the big lies.
[02:03:41.298 --> 02:03:45.742]  I know some folks are exhausted by the daily deceptions, the small lies from Trump world.
[02:03:46.522 --> 02:03:48.965]  But Trump and his allies are telling big lies.
[02:03:49.325 --> 02:03:51.907]  Right now the most popular one is, no obstruction.
[02:03:52.267 --> 02:03:53.408]  No obstruction at all.
[02:03:54.429 --> 02:03:57.432]  The attempts to obstruct are screaming off the page.
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:04.946]  I guess my point is, there's no conspiracy found in the Mueller Report, but there's no integrity either.
[02:04:06.307 --> 02:04:08.869]  So what's the role of the press in this broken environment?
[02:04:09.790 --> 02:04:15.495]  In part, our role is to keep collecting facts, all of the facts, so that citizens can make up their own minds.
[02:04:16.196 --> 02:04:22.842]  But I think it's also our role to stand up for decency and morality, especially if others won't.
[02:04:23.985 --> 02:04:26.227]  Journalists, after all, work with a code of ethics.
[02:04:26.267 --> 02:04:27.788]  But of course, they're globalist traitors.
[02:04:28.508 --> 02:04:33.932]  They're the globalist boarding party to lower the drawbridge and run up the white flag.
[02:04:34.012 --> 02:04:35.213]  They're the enemy.
[02:04:35.233 --> 02:04:44.259]  And you go, if you have the most powerful, richest country in the world with the best military and incredible resources, why would you sell it out to the chi-coms?
[02:04:44.719 --> 02:04:45.079]  Why would you?
[02:04:45.119 --> 02:04:48.361]  I mean, even from a global domination view, you wouldn't do that.
[02:04:48.401 --> 02:04:51.944]  But see, there's a spirit that wants to bring down America.
[02:04:54.395 --> 02:05:01.221]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, when we get back from this short break, Dan Lyman from InfoWarsEurope, EuropeWars.com, will be joining me.

[02:08:10.072 --> 02:08:12.774]  In fact, back at one of my last jobs in St.
[02:08:12.814 --> 02:08:16.957]  Louis before I moved here to Austin, I had to be up at 6 a.m.
[02:08:17.958 --> 02:08:18.779]  three times a week.
[02:08:20.103 --> 02:08:21.604]  I used to have to be up for a 6 a.m.
[02:08:21.624 --> 02:08:22.824]  radio show five days a week.
[02:08:23.004 --> 02:08:23.564]  That was tough.
[02:08:24.705 --> 02:08:28.886]  But what I did was I would take Brain Force first thing in the morning.
[02:08:29.706 --> 02:08:32.707]  And the morning grogginess was just gone.
[02:08:34.728 --> 02:08:38.009]  And so for me, normally it's like, I mean, really I'm not much of a morning person.
[02:08:38.029 --> 02:08:39.670]  I don't even like drinking coffee in the morning.
[02:08:39.710 --> 02:08:46.032]  It usually takes me about an hour to kind of reach, to get the engines churning.
[02:08:46.752 --> 02:08:48.933]  But when you hit the Brain Force first thing in the morning,
[02:08:49.927 --> 02:08:52.209]  You're I mean, for me, I was just cleared up immediately.
[02:08:52.249 --> 02:08:53.389]  So this is a good combo.
[02:08:53.810 --> 02:09:03.436]  You get the brain force to get you going in the morning, clear the brain fog in the morning, and then at the end of the long day, you have the knockout to put you to sleep.
[02:09:04.857 --> 02:09:10.160]  And I know I'm not the only one that has trouble with morning fog and then getting to sleep.
[02:09:10.961 --> 02:09:16.664]  So take advantage of the free bottle of knockout with a purchase of brain force today.
[02:09:16.704 --> 02:09:18.726]  You hit the brain force in the morning, clear the morning fog.
[02:09:19.701 --> 02:09:29.887]  You hit the knockout at night and get rid of the restlessness and sleepy, the lack of sleep with knockout.
[02:09:29.907 --> 02:09:32.169]  So that's at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:09:32.209 --> 02:09:33.249]  Thank you so much for your support.
[02:09:33.290 --> 02:09:33.570]  All right.
[02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:36.472]  We're working on getting Dan Lyman on right now.
[02:09:38.313 --> 02:09:46.278]  And I wanted to talk to him about what's been going on with the Yellow Jacket protests since the Notre Dame Cathedral burning.
[02:09:46.298 --> 02:09:48.179]  And you've noticed they never stopped.
[02:09:49.901 --> 02:09:54.205]  But they've intensified, and now the media is covering them again.
[02:09:54.666 --> 02:10:00.871]  And I believe the media is covering them again because they want the Notre Dame fire to be associated with the Yellow Vest protests.
[02:10:01.932 --> 02:10:05.856]  That's kind of the amalgamation that they're hoping will organically happen in the audience.
[02:10:06.397 --> 02:10:09.480]  Because they ignored the Yellow Vest protests for a month.
[02:10:10.661 --> 02:10:13.844]  They first started happening, and it got violent and everything, and they were covering it.
[02:10:15.165 --> 02:10:27.549]  And then they realized their false narrative wasn't really sticking, and that these were people that actually were upset with the way the immigration policy was going, and the fact that Macron is a total loser, a weak leader.
[02:10:27.689 --> 02:10:28.369]  Pathetic, really.
[02:10:29.629 --> 02:10:31.870]  And so they quit covering it.
[02:10:32.290 --> 02:10:37.312]  Then the Notre Dame Cathedral fire happened, and you notice how the Yellow Vests were back in the news all of a sudden.
[02:10:38.432 --> 02:10:39.832]  So I'm sure that's just a coincidence.
[02:10:39.852 --> 02:10:41.453]  I'm sure they don't want that association.
[02:10:41.873 --> 02:10:42.573]  No, of course they do.
[02:10:44.094 --> 02:10:44.834]  Of course they do.
[02:10:48.095 --> 02:10:52.638]  So we're working on getting Dan Lyman connected right now.
[02:10:55.899 --> 02:10:58.861]  But you know, uh, in fact, I just got to do this live on air.
[02:10:58.901 --> 02:11:00.282]  Are we having trouble connecting to him, guys?
[02:11:04.744 --> 02:11:08.326]  Okay, so we'll work on getting him connected.
[02:11:08.346 --> 02:11:11.108]  I'll tell you what, in the meantime,
[02:11:14.318 --> 02:11:16.639]  Well, you know, let's go to this.
[02:11:17.199 --> 02:11:21.400]  This is actually a big story right now and I'll just, I'll try to cover it right now.
[02:11:21.420 --> 02:11:26.781]  This isn't really effective, but let's just go to clip 16 and I'll kind of break this down.
[02:11:27.182 --> 02:11:31.643]  Mexican troops detain American soldiers at gunpoint in the United States.
[02:11:32.805 --> 02:11:35.369]  Heightened tensions on the southern U.S.
[02:11:35.429 --> 02:11:43.903]  border as we learn about an incident last week in which Mexican soldiers briefly detained two American service members at gunpoint on the U.S.
[02:11:43.984 --> 02:11:44.745]  side of the border.
[02:11:45.286 --> 02:11:46.928]  Jeff Paul has more from Los Angeles.
[02:11:48.826 --> 02:11:50.828]  John, military officials confirming the U.S.
[02:11:50.868 --> 02:11:55.633]  soldiers were conducting border support operations in an unmarked CBP vehicle.
[02:11:56.114 --> 02:12:01.500]  The incident happened one week ago in Clint, Texas, which is about 23 miles southeast of El Paso.
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:06.845]  They were stopped and questioned by five or six Mexican military members who thought they had crossed over.
[02:12:07.406 --> 02:12:12.610]  But in a statement, Northern Command says, though they were south of the border fence, U.S.
[02:12:12.650 --> 02:12:13.931]  soldiers remained in U.S.
[02:12:13.971 --> 02:12:16.192]  territory north of the actual border.
[02:12:16.573 --> 02:12:18.134]  Throughout the incident, the U.S.
[02:12:18.174 --> 02:12:21.676]  soldiers followed all established procedures and protocols.
[02:12:22.817 --> 02:12:27.621]  Well, now they are discussing changing those procedures and protocols.
[02:12:27.921 --> 02:12:31.684]  And so this is kind of something that I don't think people are making a big enough deal over.
[02:12:33.288 --> 02:12:37.691]  How is it that the Mexicans, their army is on U.S.
[02:12:37.731 --> 02:12:40.352]  soil, telling us what to do?
[02:12:42.294 --> 02:12:56.382]  Now, one could theorize, myself, that that's the cartels telling the Mexican army what to do, or the cartels telling the Mexican politicians what to tell the army to do, so that they can go over there, intimidate the U.S.
[02:12:56.402 --> 02:13:00.104]  troops out of actually protecting the southern border, so that they can run all their drugs across.
[02:13:02.662 --> 02:13:04.663]  How dare I engage in critical thinking?
[02:13:05.463 --> 02:13:06.243]  But here's the stories.
[02:13:07.704 --> 02:13:10.805]  Mexican soldiers detain American soldiers on U.S.
[02:13:10.985 --> 02:13:11.365]  soil.
[02:13:13.346 --> 02:13:13.646]  U.S.
[02:13:13.706 --> 02:13:19.468]  military rules under review after soldiers surrendered pistols to Mexican troops on American soil.
[02:13:19.488 --> 02:13:21.949]  I mean, this should be, like, a huge deal.
[02:13:22.029 --> 02:13:26.591]  How is it Mexican soldiers are running our country now?
[02:13:27.531 --> 02:13:31.913]  And how is it that Mexican soldiers are even coming here to disarm our soldiers to begin with?
[02:13:34.471 --> 02:13:41.874]  Geez, you know... I'm sorry, because I'm starting to get really angry about this.
[02:13:42.614 --> 02:13:45.355]  Because I was really, really ticked off about this before the show.
[02:13:47.375 --> 02:13:51.597]  And then some other news developed, and I started talking about other things, and my anger kind of subsided.
[02:13:51.637 --> 02:13:54.478]  But now I'm thinking about this again, and I'm getting ticked off.
[02:13:55.138 --> 02:13:57.619]  This is... This is bull.
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:00.160]  Because...
[02:14:02.057 --> 02:14:03.939]  I mean, the humiliation of our soldiers.
[02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:05.741]  I'm pissed off!
[02:14:07.403 --> 02:14:13.028]  Who the hell are these Mexican troops coming to our country and tell our soldiers to disarm?
[02:14:13.829 --> 02:14:15.571]  What in the **** is that?
[02:14:17.292 --> 02:14:18.033]  Unbelievable!
[02:14:18.093 --> 02:14:19.174]  See, now I'm pissed again.
[02:14:21.056 --> 02:14:21.357]  Here you go.
[02:14:22.549 --> 02:14:25.892]  Mexico warns of deep concern over armed groups at U.S.
[02:14:25.912 --> 02:14:26.173]  border.
[02:14:26.393 --> 02:14:31.118]  So, so, Mexico is now running our foreign policy at the southern border.
[02:14:31.338 --> 02:14:33.120]  And of course they want an open border.
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:36.803]  That way the cartels who run the Mexican government can get all their drugs across.
[02:14:37.004 --> 02:14:42.729]  The cartels that run the child trafficking, the human trafficking, can get all their child and all their humans across.
[02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:45.812]  Of course they're running the Mexican military!
[02:14:46.012 --> 02:14:47.513]  What the hell do you think is going on?
[02:14:47.733 --> 02:14:54.759]  And now they're coming into our country, running drugs, running guns, human trafficking, and disarming our soldiers!
[02:14:56.320 --> 02:14:56.801]  You know what?
[02:15:00.424 --> 02:15:00.884]  You know what?
[02:15:02.725 --> 02:15:04.347]  I'm actually pissed at President Trump now.
[02:15:05.207 --> 02:15:07.970]  The lack of response from the President to this is pathetic.
[02:15:08.755 --> 02:15:14.198]  We're talking about American soldiers getting disarmed on our own soil!
[02:15:15.239 --> 02:15:16.220]  That is a defeat!
[02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:17.400]  That is a loss!
[02:15:18.561 --> 02:15:24.005]  And again, I mean, how can they get away with this?
[02:15:24.485 --> 02:15:27.747]  Because the Democrat Party is anti-America.
[02:15:28.027 --> 02:15:36.973]  Because the Democrat Party, for whatever reason, supports child trafficking, supports gun running, and supports drug trafficking at the southern border.
[02:15:38.254 --> 02:15:38.754]  I don't know why.
[02:15:38.975 --> 02:15:40.376]  I know why the Mexican government does it.
[02:15:40.556 --> 02:15:42.257]  Because the cartels run the Mexican government.
[02:15:42.538 --> 02:15:44.399]  Do the cartels run the Democrat Party?
[02:15:46.721 --> 02:15:50.404]  President Trump better make a big and bold statement about U.S.
[02:15:50.464 --> 02:15:53.567]  soldiers being disarmed by Mexican soldiers on U.S.
[02:15:53.607 --> 02:15:53.927]  soil.
[02:15:54.548 --> 02:15:58.431]  We are being invaded and destroyed right now at the southern border.
[02:15:58.631 --> 02:16:00.093]  This is a joke!
[02:16:03.706 --> 02:16:10.454]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[02:16:11.074 --> 02:16:13.617]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[02:16:14.158 --> 02:16:15.079]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:17.942]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[02:16:18.463 --> 02:16:19.404]  You're our only sponsors.
[02:16:19.924 --> 02:16:25.946]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[02:16:26.406 --> 02:16:28.327]  So remember, you are the InfoWar.
[02:16:28.907 --> 02:16:30.528]  I'm not the leader, you are the leader.
[02:16:30.728 --> 02:16:32.328]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[02:16:32.688 --> 02:16:37.530]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWarStore.com that are unprecedented.
[02:16:38.090 --> 02:16:45.575]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[02:16:45.835 --> 02:16:48.177]  So I want to thank you for your support, and I want to encourage you again.
[02:16:48.657 --> 02:16:53.341]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[02:16:53.581 --> 02:16:56.323]  We have thousands of them, and it makes this all possible.
[02:16:56.743 --> 02:16:58.624]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[02:16:58.865 --> 02:16:59.305]  God bless you.
[02:17:03.035 --> 02:17:06.056]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[02:17:06.396 --> 02:17:12.318]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[02:17:12.738 --> 02:17:18.620]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:21.561]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[02:17:21.841 --> 02:17:29.347]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[02:17:29.367 --> 02:17:37.574]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[02:17:38.174 --> 02:17:42.438]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[02:17:43.306 --> 02:17:46.908]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[02:17:47.108 --> 02:17:53.070]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[02:17:54.031 --> 02:18:02.915]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[02:18:03.455 --> 02:18:07.897]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[02:18:08.377 --> 02:18:09.398]  You're probably going, wait a minute,
[02:18:10.489 --> 02:18:12.294]  For the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[02:18:12.314 --> 02:18:13.618]  It was the last run.
[02:18:13.638 --> 02:18:14.580]  It's been sold out for two months.
[02:18:15.680 --> 02:18:16.541]  How is X2 back?
[02:18:17.041 --> 02:18:20.643]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[02:18:21.103 --> 02:18:24.185]  We got put over the barrel, some industrial sabotage, we couldn't get any more.
[02:18:24.785 --> 02:18:34.811]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep-earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[02:18:34.871 --> 02:18:38.813]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[02:18:39.233 --> 02:18:40.374]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[02:18:40.794 --> 02:18:45.136]  You need to do research into iodine and the iodine conspiracy for yourself.
[02:18:45.596 --> 02:18:47.377]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[02:18:47.818 --> 02:18:49.098]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[02:18:49.639 --> 02:18:51.900]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:54.701]  What, like a 4.9 star on Power Reviews?
[02:18:55.321 --> 02:18:58.823]  But many of you hear me talk about this, and it's just more background chatter.
[02:18:59.664 --> 02:19:02.105]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[02:19:03.166 --> 02:19:05.468]  Is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[02:19:05.928 --> 02:19:18.276]  So from our brain waves to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[02:19:18.797 --> 02:19:21.318]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[02:19:21.879 --> 02:19:23.019]  So iodine is amazing.
[02:19:23.059 --> 02:19:23.620]  It's important.
[02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:25.901]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[02:19:25.961 --> 02:19:26.482]  They'll hurt you.
[02:19:26.862 --> 02:19:27.542]  This is pure.
[02:19:27.823 --> 02:19:28.523]  This is clean.
[02:19:28.863 --> 02:19:29.644]  This is amazing.
[02:19:29.964 --> 02:19:32.025]  And it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[02:19:33.306 --> 02:19:36.928]  X2, our overall best-selling product, is now back.
[02:19:37.248 --> 02:19:41.990]  X2 original from the very first original manufacturer.
[02:19:42.390 --> 02:19:48.953]  The exact same X2 at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:19:48.993 --> 02:19:51.934]  As I said, get your pre-orders in, week, week and a half.
[02:19:52.214 --> 02:20:00.977]  It's being labeled right now, it's already been bottled, and we are going to have it for you, ladies and gentlemen, at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:20:01.017 --> 02:20:02.018]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:20:06.934 --> 02:20:09.656]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:18.261 --> 02:20:25.585]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:25.705 --> 02:20:27.886]  Owen Shroyer filling in for Alex Jones today.
[02:20:28.327 --> 02:20:33.430]  Our great reporter from EuropeWars.com, Dan Lyman, joins me now.
[02:20:34.733 --> 02:20:41.148]  And Dan, I don't know if you were able to catch the last segment while we were getting connected with you, but I have a theory.
[02:20:42.276 --> 02:20:55.125]  That the reason why media is covering the Yellow Vest protests again, which they ignored even though they were continuing to go on for the last couple months, you would have not known that unless you were following your work or our work here.
[02:20:55.686 --> 02:21:00.989]  And so, but Notre Dame Cathedral fire happens and then all of a sudden the next day they're covering the Yellow Vest protests again.
[02:21:01.750 --> 02:21:03.431]  Do you think that that's a coincidence?
[02:21:03.451 --> 02:21:08.355]  Do you think the media is trying to get people to associate the fire with the Yellow Vests?
[02:21:09.055 --> 02:21:13.439]  Or has it really reached a new peak that they're forced to cover the Yellow Vest protest?
[02:21:13.459 --> 02:21:19.103]  Dan Lyman, you've been covering this really at nauseam, keeping your finger to the pulse here, your boots on the ground.
[02:21:19.663 --> 02:21:20.584]  What do you think is going on?
[02:21:20.644 --> 02:21:24.507]  What's the latest with the Yellow Vest protest and why is the media covering it all of a sudden again?
[02:21:25.583 --> 02:21:26.624]  Good to be back with you, Owen.
[02:21:27.245 --> 02:21:35.352]  I'm not really sure, of course, how things work at the big dogs in the media, why they choose to cover and not cover selectively.
[02:21:35.412 --> 02:21:48.323]  However, my understanding is that this weekend, Act 23, we are now into the 24th week of protests, was much more heavy-handed from the police and more chaotic with the protesters as well.
[02:21:50.184 --> 02:22:07.677]  I think the assumption is that they're even more enraged about the condition of their country and what's going on after this fire, because regardless of who is really actually responsible for this fire, it's definitely symbolic in many ways, you know, that just things, it's just a powder keg in France.
[02:22:07.717 --> 02:22:11.020]  So the protests from the videos that I saw from this weekend did look
[02:22:11.781 --> 02:22:13.565]  Like there was a lot more violence on the streets.
[02:22:14.026 --> 02:22:17.273]  The police look like they were being much more aggressive.
[02:22:17.954 --> 02:22:20.720]  Some very disturbing videos have come out from this past weekend.
[02:22:21.517 --> 02:22:24.878]  And then, interesting, this just broke a little while ago.
[02:22:24.898 --> 02:22:30.198]  There's a big fire in Versailles, France, that has been going on now for a couple of hours.
[02:22:30.239 --> 02:22:34.139]  They say that it's at some sort of a car dealership, but it is a large fire.
[02:22:34.159 --> 02:22:40.960]  They've required, I think, the last that I saw was 24 fire trucks and a massive crew to put this thing out.
[02:22:41.440 --> 02:22:43.601]  So it's just like, what's going on in France?
[02:22:43.721 --> 02:22:49.902]  It's so hard to see through all the smoke, so to speak, figuratively and literally, as to what is going on.
[02:22:49.922 --> 02:22:50.622]  But things just keep
[02:22:51.423 --> 02:22:54.946]  Well, and here's the sad part of it, too.
[02:22:55.427 --> 02:22:59.571]  Macron is such a weak, pathetic leader, he's nowhere to be found during this.
[02:22:59.611 --> 02:23:04.035]  I mean, he's going on vacations, he's hanging out in Switzerland, he's cheersing, he's toasting.
[02:23:04.716 --> 02:23:05.497]  France is burning.
[02:23:05.957 --> 02:23:06.978]  Where is Macron?
[02:23:06.998 --> 02:23:09.441]  I mean, is this not the weakest leader in Europe right now?
[02:23:10.683 --> 02:23:11.144]  So weak.
[02:23:11.164 --> 02:23:12.266]  He is a coward.
[02:23:12.407 --> 02:23:22.927]  And as I said the last time we were speaking, I don't know how he's hung in this long, but the powers that be that are propping him up must be, you know, in a tizzy to just try to keep this whole thing together.
[02:23:25.031 --> 02:23:25.752]  We're good to go.
[02:23:48.993 --> 02:23:54.801]  You know, then that's a new angle, too, just kind of wargaming all this out since we don't know what happened with the fire.
[02:23:55.161 --> 02:24:01.069]  And in fact, the more the more forensic analysis that comes out, the more it actually looks like arson.
[02:24:01.983 --> 02:24:04.064]  But that's kind of a new angle.
[02:24:04.184 --> 02:24:07.645]  Maybe powers that be in France thought, hey, let's burn the cathedral.
[02:24:07.685 --> 02:24:09.926]  That'll quiet down the Yellow Vest protest.
[02:24:10.886 --> 02:24:12.347]  Almost like a Reichstag moment.
[02:24:12.907 --> 02:24:14.747]  But what are the people in France saying about this?
[02:24:15.068 --> 02:24:22.670]  I mean, what are the people in France saying about the fact that they're going to have a competition to design the new roof of the cathedral?
[02:24:22.690 --> 02:24:25.611]  To me, that's saying we're going to pick and select a globalist image.
[02:24:26.171 --> 02:24:27.732]  But what are the people of France saying about that?
[02:24:28.843 --> 02:24:34.227]  Well, from what I've seen on Twitter and the comments, just reading the comment sections, people are very cynical at this point.
[02:24:34.608 --> 02:24:49.860]  So, I mean, a lot of people who, a few years ago, might not have questioned the official narrative, at this point, they're just seeing through the BS, and they're just saying this is nonsense to say that this, you know... Well, and let me just stop you there before you answer the question, because I just want to echo what you're saying.
[02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:51.501]  I am experiencing the same thing.
[02:24:51.901 --> 02:24:55.662]  In fact, the people I know that lived in France or studied abroad in France, they love France.
[02:24:55.702 --> 02:24:59.284]  They hate when I talk trash on Macron and say that France's culture is crumbling.
[02:24:59.584 --> 02:25:00.965]  They live in the denial of that.
[02:25:01.625 --> 02:25:04.126]  They're now saying, OK, I see what you're talking about now.
[02:25:04.386 --> 02:25:06.847]  And they're not buying that this wasn't arson either.
[02:25:07.087 --> 02:25:08.548]  So you're definitely right about that.
[02:25:09.838 --> 02:25:10.378]  Absolutely.
[02:25:10.398 --> 02:25:13.579]  And you know, there are so many countries now that just feel like a powder keg.
[02:25:13.599 --> 02:25:15.680]  You just have so much going on there.
[02:25:15.740 --> 02:25:19.042]  And as I mentioned last time, there's just protests in multiple countries.
[02:25:19.122 --> 02:25:23.723]  It seems like every weekend for a variety of reasons, some of them good, some of them not so good.
[02:25:24.063 --> 02:25:29.626]  You have major, major climate change protests going on in London now that they've arrested over a thousand people.
[02:25:29.666 --> 02:25:30.246]  These people are
[02:25:30.847 --> 02:25:40.366]  Yeah, they're staging, they're faking they're dying in front of government buildings, they're gluing themselves to trains.
[02:25:40.928 --> 02:25:41.870]  It's insane behavior.
[02:25:42.964 --> 02:25:43.824]  It's utter madness.
[02:25:44.065 --> 02:25:48.927]  And so just to see where things go from a week-to-week basis, there is never a dull moment.
[02:25:49.407 --> 02:25:57.611]  As I've covered in the past as well, we have this situation where migrants are now crossing en masse from France over to the UK in little boats.
[02:25:58.832 --> 02:26:05.195]  The border guard there, just Border Force, just picked up a whole another round of them this weekend, just making their way across.
[02:26:05.255 --> 02:26:10.117]  And they think that, you know, there aren't going to be any consequences as long as they can make it onto UK soil.
[02:26:10.597 --> 02:26:11.938]  It's just like, it's just madness.
[02:26:12.498 --> 02:26:16.260]  Well, and every time we see these videos, I mean, Europe is the worst.
[02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:21.982]  I mean, honestly, like, the people that come across the southern border in the West, it's like 80% military-age men.
[02:26:22.903 --> 02:26:27.785]  The boats and the migrants they catch in Europe, it's like 90, 95% military.
[02:26:27.825 --> 02:26:28.765]  It's like 100 even!
[02:26:30.526 --> 02:26:31.647]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:26:31.787 --> 02:26:32.367]  It's crazy.
[02:26:32.387 --> 02:26:34.128]  You know, I just had some friends visiting.
[02:26:34.824 --> 02:26:58.456]  From the States they had never been to Europe and they weren't sure what to expect and they spent a lot of time down in Italy and they did have a great time touristing but they were shocked by some of the things that they saw in some of these formerly great Italian cities such as Milan where they just said you know I genuinely just didn't feel safe in certain areas and it's probably a really a shock as an American let's say if you're insulated from that to see what's going
[02:26:58.456 --> 02:27:02.597]  Yeah, and that's so weird because it's the exact opposite of what you would expect.
[02:27:02.617 --> 02:27:05.618]  I mean, I try to localize things from my experience to understand these issues better.
[02:27:05.638 --> 02:27:06.538]  I grew up in St.
[02:27:06.558 --> 02:27:06.858]  Louis and
[02:27:22.902 --> 02:27:23.303]  I don't
[02:27:37.782 --> 02:27:38.663]  The current status of the city.
[02:27:38.683 --> 02:27:50.073]  So what they did is they went in, they renovated, they cleared it out, they readjusted some things, and now you go to these areas and people can actually go and they don't feel like they're looking at run-down buildings and gangbangers running around.
[02:27:50.353 --> 02:27:53.015]  And it's starting to get back to the right place.
[02:27:53.356 --> 02:27:54.717]  But in France they're doing the opposite!
[02:27:55.017 --> 02:28:02.824]  It's like, oh my gosh, you know, our culture, all these great monuments and everything in Italy and everything, it's all being either literally burned to the ground or now it's like
[02:28:04.045 --> 02:28:06.948]  These tent cities and stuff, it's not fun to go walk around there.
[02:28:07.248 --> 02:28:08.830]  They're just putting more of it out.
[02:28:08.910 --> 02:28:10.952]  It's like they don't even want to protect their own culture.
[02:28:12.392 --> 02:28:13.012]  They don't at all.
[02:28:13.052 --> 02:28:15.814]  And unfortunately, this is the same story playing out across the West.
[02:28:15.874 --> 02:28:20.476]  I was glad to see that Tucker Carlson shone a light on the tent cities in Los Angeles.
[02:28:20.857 --> 02:28:24.619]  As you know, we've been covering the tent city situation in California for a couple years now.
[02:28:24.639 --> 02:28:34.664]  We were one of the first kind of international outlets to bring a little light to that because it's kind of a new phenomenon where there's just, you know, lines of the streets just lined with people.
[02:28:34.704 --> 02:28:36.025]  Well, let's talk about that.
[02:28:36.105 --> 02:28:38.686]  Let's talk about that because they're also experiencing that in the UK.
[02:28:39.847 --> 02:28:51.973]  And look, I mean, here in Austin, Dan, you can't... I mean, I could probably... I don't want to do this report, but... I mean, I could take a camera to about five different spots here in Austin, and there's whole tent cities.
[02:28:52.493 --> 02:28:56.094]  But because there's some still wooded areas, they're able to kind of hide back behind the woods.
[02:28:56.114 --> 02:28:59.436]  But we're talking about whole economies of tent cities in Austin now.
[02:29:02.748 --> 02:29:05.932]  BrainForce Plus is a top-tier nootropin.
[02:29:06.673 --> 02:29:09.156]  Focus, clarity, energy.
[02:29:09.777 --> 02:29:14.223]  But instead of having a 7x markup, we have a 150% markup.
[02:29:15.244 --> 02:29:17.427]  Right now, it's massively discounted.

[02:30:11.836 --> 02:30:20.263]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:30:20.863 --> 02:30:30.711]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:30:30.951 --> 02:30:39.478]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:30:40.384 --> 02:30:41.285]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:30:41.645 --> 02:30:42.686]  You must experience it.
[02:30:42.806 --> 02:30:44.707]  It is a total game-changer.
[02:30:44.767 --> 02:30:49.151]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:30:49.831 --> 02:30:51.253]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[02:30:51.333 --> 02:30:52.333]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[02:30:52.814 --> 02:30:58.999]  So take a half packet the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:30:59.499 --> 02:31:01.241]  TurboForce at MForceLive.com.
[02:31:02.502 --> 02:31:07.145]  You're north of 281, south of the scales, correct?
[02:31:10.555 --> 02:31:10.859]  Yeah, I hope.
[02:31:38.194 --> 02:31:47.136]  Chief Karish did say today that they have reached over 300,000 apprehensions along the southwestern border for this fiscal year alone.
[02:31:47.516 --> 02:31:50.897]  Now, specifically here in the RGV, they have seen over 130,000.
[02:31:50.977 --> 02:32:00.299]  CBP today released that they're expecting to apprehend over 55,000 family units for the month of March alone.
[02:32:01.019 --> 02:32:08.023]  The fact of the matter is this is not an emergency and the president's fear-mongering doesn't make it one.
[02:32:08.263 --> 02:32:10.765]  There is no crisis at the border.
[02:32:10.945 --> 02:32:16.928]  I'll state that this is a manufactured crisis and a crisis that manufactured by the Trump administration.
[02:32:17.128 --> 02:32:27.394]  But he clearly understands in his gut what stirs his base and he is determined to inflame these fears regardless of the facts or the effect this will have on the company.
[02:32:27.774 --> 02:32:31.415]  What's at the core of this crisis is the Trump administration.
[02:32:31.475 --> 02:32:37.176]  The reason that the Democrats refuse to call this a crisis is because they see it as an opportunity.
[02:32:37.216 --> 02:32:43.137]  CBP is facing an unprecedented humanitarian and border security crisis all along our southwest border.
[02:32:43.197 --> 02:32:48.678]  The Mexican Interior Secretary said that they're planning to see come through Mexico the mother of all caravans.
[02:32:48.758 --> 02:32:51.718]  It is very definitely a crisis and the question is what do you do about it?
[02:32:51.738 --> 02:32:52.778]  We will build a wall.
[02:32:53.358 --> 02:32:54.379]  We will build a wall.
[02:32:55.519 --> 02:32:56.999]  We will build a wall.
[02:33:06.354 --> 02:33:08.967]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:21.624 --> 02:33:29.167]  You know, it's crazy to think this, but it happens almost every day that three hours is not enough to cover all the news.
[02:33:30.008 --> 02:33:39.551]  And so, I've got Dan Lyman with me here, and we're gonna continue to go down some of these news stories, but man, I'm just still swamped with news I'm not even gonna be able to get to.
[02:33:39.972 --> 02:33:42.773]  And then Paul Joseph Watson takes over for the fourth hour.
[02:33:42.813 --> 02:33:44.413]  Will Johnson hosting the War Room today.
[02:33:44.433 --> 02:33:45.094]  In fact,
[02:33:46.107 --> 02:33:51.092]  Will Johnson will be having Peter D'Abraska on today to discuss his story.
[02:33:51.552 --> 02:33:57.918]  Illegal alien who worked as election canvasser booked for attempted murder after drive-by shooting.
[02:33:58.318 --> 02:34:01.842]  And of course, it turns out he's associated with CASA, C-A-S-A.
[02:34:03.363 --> 02:34:10.269]  That says that they fight for immigrant rights, which is of course, I mean, the definition of hyperbole.
[02:34:10.669 --> 02:34:14.472]  They're actually fighting against immigrant rights and standing for illegal immigrants.
[02:34:15.032 --> 02:34:16.634]  So that'll all be on the war room.
[02:34:16.654 --> 02:34:18.975]  But Dan Lyman from EuropeWars.com is with me now.
[02:34:19.456 --> 02:34:23.119]  You know, Dan, I'm thinking about these tent cities in the break and how to talk about this.
[02:34:24.785 --> 02:34:25.986]  And there seems to be different issues.
[02:34:26.026 --> 02:34:39.491]  I mean, the tent cities that you see in Europe and France over here are mostly due to the open borders, because the people come into the country, they have nowhere else to do, they don't have jobs, I don't even know if they're looking for jobs, and so they end up in these tent cities.
[02:34:40.451 --> 02:34:45.013]  And so it creates these big, basically just street-long tent cities and you can't walk by.
[02:34:45.413 --> 02:34:55.577]  In America, it seems to be different, at least here in Austin, where the tent cities are just kind of people that are homeless and for whatever reason they don't want to get out of homelessness.
[02:34:55.597 --> 02:34:56.477]  I guess they enjoy it.
[02:34:57.679 --> 02:35:03.347]  But, I mean, what do you think is happening in Europe right now with these tent cities?
[02:35:03.387 --> 02:35:11.358]  I mean, is it pretty much just these migrants come in through the open borders, they have no prospects, nowhere else to go, so they just eventually flock to these tent cities?
[02:35:13.354 --> 02:35:20.722]  Yeah, in many cases with the tent cities in Europe, it's definitely, typically it's 100% migrant in a lot of these areas.
[02:35:20.762 --> 02:35:31.613]  For instance, the canals in Paris, they have, they accumulate sometimes up to thousands of migrants will start a tent city and be allowed to take it that far before the police and the authorities come in.
[02:35:31.613 --> 02:35:32.073]  We're good to go.
[02:35:59.473 --> 02:36:00.556]  Piling up at the border.
[02:36:00.636 --> 02:36:01.699]  And look at that boat!
[02:36:01.820 --> 02:36:02.642]  It's all men!
[02:36:02.663 --> 02:36:04.047]  It's literally all men!
[02:36:05.049 --> 02:36:06.550]  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[02:36:06.610 --> 02:36:09.552]  So that is what's a little bit different than the situation at the U.S.
[02:36:09.592 --> 02:36:10.512]  border at this time.
[02:36:10.572 --> 02:36:17.977]  Of course, we have this crisis with families now, and of course, that's why they're being allowed into the country by the hundreds of thousands.
[02:36:18.037 --> 02:36:19.278]  So there is a little bit different.
[02:36:19.298 --> 02:36:23.980]  But the same story is playing out that Western countries are being flooded.
[02:36:24.461 --> 02:36:25.902]  Australia is being flooded.
[02:36:27.322 --> 02:36:30.845]  According to a senator from Australia, they took in something like 150,000 migrants in one month alone.
[02:36:33.446 --> 02:36:35.987]  So, you know, it's playing out the same everywhere.
[02:36:36.007 --> 02:36:38.408]  The recipe is a little different for each region.
[02:36:38.488 --> 02:36:45.830]  But yeah, I mean, something has to be done because that's what's propelling unrest in so many cases, even if the media won't report that.
[02:36:46.230 --> 02:36:48.611]  They'll say it's about a fuel tax hike, whatever.
[02:36:48.671 --> 02:36:55.293]  It's Europeans watching their countries be devastated and on their own dime, they're paying for it.
[02:36:55.713 --> 02:36:57.554]  And for instance, last week, I just covered this
[02:36:58.394 --> 02:37:11.144]  There are now Swedish towns that have taken in something like their population has increased by let's say 25% in some of these towns with migrants only and 90% of those migrants if not more are on social assistance.
[02:37:11.604 --> 02:37:19.450]  So we have Swedish towns now that are facing economic collapse in some of these towns and simultaneously the federal government is slashing
[02:37:19.990 --> 02:37:21.251]  It's heartbreaking.
[02:37:45.473 --> 02:37:49.914]  And for radio audience, they're just rolling B-roll of these tent cities.
[02:37:50.474 --> 02:38:03.478]  It basically looks like you're in a dystopian movie and you're just walking down the street of an old abandoned city and you've just got hundreds of tents, cardboard beds set up, trash just everywhere.
[02:38:03.518 --> 02:38:07.519]  It's like it's been totally abandoned and it's just run by the dregs of society now.
[02:38:08.119 --> 02:38:10.060]  But this is what open borders have done to Europe.
[02:38:11.260 --> 02:38:13.361]  You know, there's some other international news happening right now.
[02:38:13.441 --> 02:38:17.763]  China shows off new destroyer ship as Xi views naval parade.
[02:38:18.123 --> 02:38:21.925]  North Korea's Kim Jong-un to meet Putin in Russia this week.
[02:38:22.185 --> 02:38:23.945]  Those are two big stories that are developing right now.
[02:38:23.985 --> 02:38:27.587]  But Dan, what are you working on right now for EuropeWars.com?
[02:38:29.080 --> 02:38:32.404]  Right now we're actually working on a story about the migrants coming across the channel.
[02:38:32.444 --> 02:38:48.603]  We've been covering that one regularly so I wanted to get that news out because that's something that is like just it's just happening and hardly anyone's talking about it gets it maybe you know a quick mention in UK media but basically these migrants and a lot of them are Iranian or so there's some sort of pipeline coming from Iran and
[02:38:48.983 --> 02:38:49.624]  We're good to go.
[02:39:10.862 --> 02:39:14.565]  So it's just like this steady drip going across the channel.
[02:39:14.585 --> 02:39:15.906]  So that's what we're working on today.
[02:39:16.586 --> 02:39:29.495]  And yesterday we just published a story about a migrant from Eritrea in Sweden who robbed, attacked, attempted rape, a slew of crimes across the span of one month.
[02:39:29.936 --> 02:39:32.137]  He was convicted of all of them.
[02:39:32.177 --> 02:39:35.059]  He will face no prison time and will not be deported.
[02:39:35.119 --> 02:39:36.240]  So you have to wonder what
[02:39:36.340 --> 02:39:38.282]  What is wrong with these people?
[02:39:51.417 --> 02:39:53.478]  Why do they want to see the collapse of their civilization?
[02:39:53.538 --> 02:39:56.140]  Why do they want to see more crime?
[02:39:56.260 --> 02:39:57.481]  I mean, literally, more rape?
[02:39:57.501 --> 02:40:09.069]  I mean, this is all increasing with the illegal migration, but it seems like they just welcome it, promote it, and then that just empowers others to continue down this road of illegal immigration with these open borders.
[02:40:09.089 --> 02:40:09.549]  Of course!
[02:40:10.110 --> 02:40:10.910]  Of course it's going to happen.
[02:40:10.930 --> 02:40:15.553]  I mean, do you see this trend changing at all, Dan?
[02:40:15.833 --> 02:40:17.474]  I mean, it seems to be going one direction.
[02:40:17.515 --> 02:40:20.597]  We do see some leadership popping up in Italy.
[02:40:21.558 --> 02:40:25.265]  Uh, but I mean, other than that, I mean, is there anything stopping this?
[02:40:26.755 --> 02:40:27.456]  It's a good question.
[02:40:27.876 --> 02:40:30.658]  Salvini has done a great job, but he is just one man.
[02:40:31.379 --> 02:40:38.865]  He has cut down the crossings across the Mediterranean to Italy, apparently over 90% since taking office, which is fantastic.
[02:40:38.905 --> 02:40:41.086]  However, they're just going to other countries now.
[02:40:41.187 --> 02:40:42.207]  They're still going to Greece.
[02:40:42.247 --> 02:40:43.428]  They're still going to Spain.
[02:40:43.769 --> 02:40:45.210]  I was just in Portugal and Lisbon.
[02:40:45.530 --> 02:40:46.751]  Quite a few migrants there as well.
[02:40:46.771 --> 02:40:48.012]  You don't hear about that too often.
[02:40:48.352 --> 02:40:49.934]  So they're still finding their way across.
[02:40:50.354 --> 02:40:55.298]  So it would take a concerted effort EU-wide to do anything about this issue.
[02:40:56.419 --> 02:41:03.743]  Maybe that's on the horizon because we do have European parliamentary elections coming in just a few short weeks.
[02:41:03.984 --> 02:41:14.791]  And we have Salvini and like-minded parties trying to form a new coalition basically within the European Parliament that will challenge the existing global order.
[02:41:14.851 --> 02:41:23.877]  But I mean, no one's going to go down without a fight in this scenario, ranging from Theresa May, Macron and Juncker to the nationalist populists on the other side.
[02:41:23.917 --> 02:41:25.198]  It is definitely a battle that is
[02:41:26.018 --> 02:41:30.123]  It's forming and taking shape, and I'm sure it will get much more intense in the years to come.
[02:41:30.743 --> 02:41:37.350]  Well, and you know, I think part of the reason why, and who knows the Notre Dame Cathedral story, I mean, look, it looks like arson.
[02:41:37.370 --> 02:41:40.853]  As far as who did it, you know, we'll never probably know.
[02:41:41.454 --> 02:41:46.839]  But I feel like they don't even want, it's like they're gonna, more of this stuff is gonna keep happening.
[02:41:47.620 --> 02:41:53.122]  And what ends up happening is that the media censors it and so you don't know why places are burning.
[02:41:53.142 --> 02:41:56.064]  I mean, nobody knows about all the bombings that are happening in Sweden.
[02:41:56.744 --> 02:42:00.986]  So there's all this stuff happening because of the migrant waves, all the violence, all the terror.
[02:42:02.025 --> 02:42:04.367]  But the media doesn't cover it so the people don't know what's going on.
[02:42:05.087 --> 02:42:14.074]  And so what they want is this to create a situation where if you even mention migration when it comes to these terror attacks or tent cities, they say, oh, no, that's a false equivalency.
[02:42:14.114 --> 02:42:16.416]  That's intolerant, even though that's exactly what it is.
[02:42:16.436 --> 02:42:17.817]  But, you know, I look at these countries.
[02:42:17.937 --> 02:42:18.698]  Greece is another one.
[02:42:18.718 --> 02:42:23.681]  I mean, they haven't been hit too hard as far as, you know, terror and bombings and the ruin of their culture.
[02:42:24.622 --> 02:42:30.389]  I mean, I just think about it, like, imagine a terror attack in Greece, or like, they burn the Acropolis or something.
[02:42:30.409 --> 02:42:33.794]  I mean, when is Europe going to say enough is enough, Dan?
[02:42:33.834 --> 02:42:34.575]  Final 30 seconds.
[02:42:35.652 --> 02:42:36.373]  That's a good question.
[02:42:36.393 --> 02:42:40.456]  I think that that process is happening and I think that people are starting to find their voice.
[02:42:41.137 --> 02:42:46.642]  But there is definitely a culture in many of these countries that are chaining by other people to keep other people silent.
[02:42:46.682 --> 02:42:50.545]  But people are starting to find their voice and we see that occurring in France now.
[02:42:50.585 --> 02:42:53.648]  They are out in mass and I see that continuing through the summer for sure.
[02:42:54.049 --> 02:42:59.393]  Follow Dan Lyman's work at EuropeWars.com and on Twitter at CitizenAnalyst.
[02:42:59.433 --> 02:42:59.794]  Thank you, Dan.

[02:47:29.739 --> 02:47:33.141]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:47:33.481 --> 02:47:38.504]  Alright, my last segment here hosting today, Paul Joseph Watson is going to take over.
[02:47:38.564 --> 02:47:43.928]  So I'm going to do a news blitz here and just get to as much of this news as possible before Paul takes over.
[02:47:43.948 --> 02:47:49.111]  Alright, we've got the story at InfoWars.com, but this is just developing today.
[02:47:49.792 --> 02:47:51.693]  First of all, this came out over the weekend.
[02:47:53.129 --> 02:47:57.471]  Jussie Smollett still too traumatized by racist attack to sleep at night.
[02:47:58.011 --> 02:48:13.099]  So, as InfoWars told you, on the heels of it all coming out that Jussie Smollett staged this crime, filed a fake police report, staged the whole thing, we told you that they're going to come full circle and they're going to say, no, that's not what happened.
[02:48:13.759 --> 02:48:15.140]  Jussie Smollett was really attacked.
[02:48:15.580 --> 02:48:16.621]  That's how desperate they're getting.
[02:48:17.081 --> 02:48:19.802]  I mean, they're engaged in domestic terrorism every day.
[02:48:20.223 --> 02:48:20.723]  But now,
[02:48:23.419 --> 02:48:27.842]  Brothers accused of attacking Jussie Smollett sue his attorney for defamation.
[02:48:27.882 --> 02:48:35.228]  So it's actually the two attorneys, their firms, Tina Glandian and Mark Garagos, that are being sued.
[02:48:35.548 --> 02:48:36.589]  So it's not even Smollett.
[02:48:36.609 --> 02:48:42.453]  But they're saying, no, they lied and they defamed us when they said it was our idea or that we actually did this.
[02:48:42.773 --> 02:48:44.014]  They're saying Smollett did the whole thing.
[02:48:44.054 --> 02:48:44.554]  So here's the deal.
[02:48:44.774 --> 02:48:46.656]  Smollett's a punk ass bitch.
[02:48:47.827 --> 02:48:52.191]  Who created a fake hate crime to try to start a civil war, a race war in this country.
[02:48:52.371 --> 02:48:54.433]  Jussie Smollett belongs in jail.
[02:48:55.053 --> 02:48:56.454]  Now, I'm not a violent person.
[02:48:58.236 --> 02:49:00.778]  And I don't wish any violence upon Jussie Smollett.
[02:49:01.759 --> 02:49:06.983]  But you know what would have happened to Jussie Smollett in a real world that's not dominated by cucks?
[02:49:08.444 --> 02:49:10.166]  Well, you can imagine.
[02:49:12.318 --> 02:49:18.563]  The left is now going with the original fake story that Jussie Smollett was attacked by Trump supporters, just like we predicted.
[02:49:18.804 --> 02:49:20.145]  Do you see how sick these people are?
[02:49:22.367 --> 02:49:24.148]  But I hope the Chicago police do the right thing.
[02:49:24.168 --> 02:49:24.589]  Oh!
[02:49:24.809 --> 02:49:25.910]  Oh, and by the way, by the way!
[02:49:27.331 --> 02:49:27.952]  Oh my gosh.
[02:49:30.234 --> 02:49:31.215]  Oh my gosh, who was it?
[02:49:31.775 --> 02:49:32.896]  I don't even think it's in the story.
[02:49:35.538 --> 02:49:37.100]  The law firm
[02:49:38.735 --> 02:49:51.386]  Filed a request of discovery so that they could find out what happened in the Chicago DA in Cook County, why Smollett was let go.
[02:49:51.466 --> 02:49:54.088]  What happened in Kim Foxx's office, the communique's.
[02:49:56.670 --> 02:49:58.431]  Oh my gosh, this is so unbelievable.
[02:49:58.571 --> 02:50:03.175]  A lawyer blocked that from happening and it was a big liberal Democrat lawyer.
[02:50:03.816 --> 02:50:06.258]  Oh my gosh, I can't remember who it was now.
[02:50:08.211 --> 02:50:10.813]  But they're attempting to block that discovery, folks.
[02:50:11.834 --> 02:50:13.415]  So, they know what happened.
[02:50:13.615 --> 02:50:16.217]  They know Smollett lied about the whole thing.
[02:50:16.377 --> 02:50:18.219]  They know that they did a false police report.
[02:50:18.299 --> 02:50:20.801]  And the lawyers know that they defamed the two brothers.
[02:50:22.622 --> 02:50:27.946]  So, they're now trying to stop discovery because guess what, folks?
[02:50:28.567 --> 02:50:33.410]  It's gonna come out, this went to the top of the Democrat Party, Barack Obama.
[02:50:34.271 --> 02:50:34.511]  Yeah.
[02:50:35.352 --> 02:50:37.994]  And so they're doing everything they can to try to cover this up right now.
[02:50:39.983 --> 02:50:40.323]  Wow.
[02:50:41.804 --> 02:50:51.332]  And so they're going to do everything they can to try to stop discovery from happening because it's going to lead to Obama, to Kamala Harris.
[02:50:51.352 --> 02:50:57.357]  It's just unbelievable what's happening in this country right now.
[02:50:59.767 --> 02:51:00.848]  So, get ready for that.
[02:51:00.948 --> 02:51:04.289]  Jussie Smollett, you are a pathetic worm.
[02:51:04.950 --> 02:51:06.951]  You pathetic worm.
[02:51:07.691 --> 02:51:11.093]  You need to rot in a hole in the ground.
[02:51:13.314 --> 02:51:14.835]  That's what you deserve, but don't worry.
[02:51:15.882 --> 02:51:16.702]  You know what, Jussie?
[02:51:17.283 --> 02:51:32.389]  The only redemption for you, the only redemption for Jussie Smollett, is to come out and admit you're a liar, to come out and admit you're a phony, to come out and admit you tried to start domestic terror in this country!
[02:51:32.769 --> 02:51:34.149]  Come out and admit it, Jussie!
[02:51:34.409 --> 02:51:36.310]  Come out and admit the Democrats ran you!
[02:51:36.570 --> 02:51:40.212]  Come out and admit there were other people involved in this fake hate crime!
[02:51:40.752 --> 02:51:41.912]  Come out and admit it, Jussie!
[02:51:42.133 --> 02:51:43.013]  Be a man!
[02:51:43.253 --> 02:51:44.313]  But you're not a man!
[02:51:44.554 --> 02:51:45.454]  You're a little boy!
[02:51:45.874 --> 02:51:46.634]  You're a little punk!
[02:51:49.195 --> 02:51:49.635]  Excuse me.
[02:51:50.655 --> 02:51:58.877]  Forgot to mention that thousands of Boy Scout leaders are now facing accusations of child sex crimes.
[02:51:58.957 --> 02:51:59.838]  Boy, that's not good.
[02:52:08.120 --> 02:52:12.321]  Tell you, that Jussie Smollett really is a piece of crap.
[02:52:13.547 --> 02:52:14.067]  Moving on.
[02:52:14.568 --> 02:52:18.311]  House Judiciary Chairman subpoenas ex-White House Counsel Don McGahn.
[02:52:18.331 --> 02:52:25.498]  So now Jerry Nadler is out here subpoenaing anybody and everybody to keep the Mueller Report in the news, to keep Russian collusion going.
[02:52:25.638 --> 02:52:29.861]  Jerry Nadler, who envies Humpty Dumpty's waistline.
[02:52:31.363 --> 02:52:32.584]  This fat turd.
[02:52:35.742 --> 02:52:36.423]  I'm sick of this.
[02:52:37.184 --> 02:52:37.705]  These people.
[02:52:38.446 --> 02:52:43.473]  Trump and allies ramp up attacks as McGahn emerges as chief witness in Mueller report.
[02:52:43.634 --> 02:52:44.195]  Oh yes!
[02:52:44.515 --> 02:52:45.977]  They're ramping up attacks!
[02:52:46.258 --> 02:52:51.646]  Trump has been non-stop under attack with your fake news since he announced he was running!
[02:52:52.830 --> 02:52:56.215]  Oh yes, but Trump and his allies are ramping up attacks.
[02:52:56.555 --> 02:52:56.916]  Yeah, what?
[02:52:56.976 --> 02:53:00.381]  Against the treasonous, corrupt deep state?
[02:53:00.942 --> 02:53:02.484]  The ones that tried to destroy him?
[02:53:02.704 --> 02:53:04.267]  The ones that illegally spied on him?
[02:53:05.208 --> 02:53:06.269]  What'd you do, Jerry?
[02:53:06.430 --> 02:53:07.151]  Eat the evidence?
[02:53:10.154 --> 02:53:12.876]  I'm telling you, I can't, you know, let me tell you something.
[02:53:13.496 --> 02:53:14.877]  I'm not alone in this, okay?
[02:53:15.538 --> 02:53:18.080]  We're a voice for the weary out there.
[02:53:18.560 --> 02:53:20.081]  We're fed up with this crap.
[02:53:20.361 --> 02:53:22.163]  We're fed up with the Jussie Smollett's.
[02:53:22.463 --> 02:53:24.164]  We're fed up with the Barack Obama's.
[02:53:24.404 --> 02:53:25.945]  We're fed up with the Jerry Nadler's.
[02:53:26.206 --> 02:53:27.827]  We're fed up with the Eric Swalwell's.
[02:53:27.987 --> 02:53:29.028]  And I got news for ya!
[02:53:29.248 --> 02:53:33.771]  If you continue to force these people down our throats, it's not gonna be pretty!
[02:53:34.552 --> 02:53:36.153]  We're at our wits end with you!
[02:53:38.598 --> 02:53:41.881]  Dem leaders stress more Trump probes downplay impeachment.
[02:53:41.901 --> 02:53:54.651]  So you've got half the Democrat Party crying for impeachment, half the Democrat Party saying we can't call for impeachment, it'll kill our chances in 2020, and then you've got all these little committees that these Democrats are on, subpoenaing anybody and everybody, probing Donald Trump.
[02:53:54.671 --> 02:53:59.936]  I mean, you guys have been probing Donald Trump's butthole for three freaking years!
[02:54:00.276 --> 02:54:01.217]  Get out of there!
[02:54:02.638 --> 02:54:03.479]  You sick freaks!
[02:54:05.239 --> 02:54:07.761]  Why don't you just, the Democrats should just be proctologists!
[02:54:07.781 --> 02:54:09.302]  They're so obsessed with these probes.
[02:54:11.024 --> 02:54:11.644]  That's what they are.
[02:54:11.704 --> 02:54:14.227]  Democrats are now political proctologists.
[02:54:14.567 --> 02:54:17.830]  And their cities are literally falling apart.
[02:54:17.850 --> 02:54:19.651]  God.
[02:54:26.397 --> 02:54:30.800]  House Democrat leaders urge caution on impeachment as members plot way forward.
[02:54:30.820 --> 02:54:31.441]  They don't know what to do.
[02:54:32.506 --> 02:54:34.667]  But they're going on with their fake news!
[02:54:34.727 --> 02:54:35.687]  I mean, it's unbelievable!
[02:54:36.027 --> 02:54:37.167]  They fake a hate crime!
[02:54:37.567 --> 02:54:39.288]  They get totally caught with Jussie Smollett!
[02:54:39.328 --> 02:54:40.408]  They say, oh no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:54:40.928 --> 02:54:42.928]  Jussie Smollett was victimized by a hate crime.
[02:54:42.948 --> 02:54:43.809]  He was attacked by Trump.
[02:54:43.969 --> 02:54:45.729]  Literally, the whole thing totally blown wide open.
[02:54:45.929 --> 02:54:46.789]  Everybody knows it was fake.
[02:54:46.989 --> 02:54:48.230]  And they stick to their fake news!
[02:54:48.270 --> 02:54:50.770]  I mean, that is... Do you realize how incredible that is?
[02:54:51.350 --> 02:54:52.411]  But that's not even the worst!
[02:54:52.831 --> 02:54:54.051]  They do it with Russian collusion!
[02:54:55.384 --> 02:54:56.725]  There's a story here from Breitbart.
[02:54:57.445 --> 02:55:01.386]  Top 51 fake news bombshells the media spread about Russiagate.
[02:55:01.406 --> 02:55:03.067]  51 bombshells, they claimed.
[02:55:03.907 --> 02:55:04.788]  All of it fake news.
[02:55:05.828 --> 02:55:09.669]  And yet, they still stick to their lies.
[02:55:09.929 --> 02:55:10.630]  Folks, look.
[02:55:11.230 --> 02:55:16.232]  This is so, honestly, it's so incredible to me.
[02:55:17.904 --> 02:55:37.524]  You know, because when you have people that are going to stick to known lies and just sit right there with a cold straight face and tell you a lie that you know is a lie, and they're going to sit there and look you in the eye and lie to you, knowing they're lying to you, folks, you need to realize how dangerous this is.
[02:55:38.792 --> 02:55:42.114]  If somebody's willing to lie to your face, folks, what else are they willing to do?
[02:55:42.355 --> 02:55:48.159]  If somebody's willing to stage a hate crime to try to start a race war and a civil war in this country, what else are they willing to do?
[02:55:48.419 --> 02:55:54.083]  If these people are willing to commit treason to try to cover up for their crimes, what else are they willing to do?
[02:55:54.383 --> 02:56:02.069]  If they're willing to start an illegal investigation over fake news and then stick to it after it gets proved fake news, what else are they willing to do?
[02:56:02.089 --> 02:56:03.290]  Oh, you want to know what else they're willing to do?
[02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:04.791]  Kill a baby after it's born.
[02:56:04.951 --> 02:56:05.952]  You want to know what else they're willing to do?
[02:56:06.152 --> 02:56:09.534]  Put mercury in your vaccines so that it brain damages ya.
[02:56:18.179 --> 02:56:21.120]  Pete Buttjudge says that God doesn't have a political party.
[02:56:21.340 --> 02:56:21.581]  Really?
[02:56:22.141 --> 02:56:23.942]  Your political party murders babies.
[02:56:24.182 --> 02:56:26.463]  I think God does have a political party.
[02:56:26.523 --> 02:56:27.584]  The one that doesn't murder babies.
[02:56:31.464 --> 02:56:36.546]  Boy, you know, that headline pretty much sums it up, doesn't it?
[02:56:36.766 --> 02:56:40.927]  We'll just leave it at that for Butt Judge.
[02:56:42.387 --> 02:56:43.808]  You know, that's actually an interesting one.
[02:56:43.828 --> 02:56:46.569]  I think it's a little more important than people want to lead on.
[02:56:47.529 --> 02:56:49.009]  Trump and the Queen in the same room?
[02:56:49.669 --> 02:56:50.810]  That's going to be fireworks.
[02:56:52.830 --> 02:57:01.076]  And then you'll see all the glad-handing and everything to this queen who knows how well she is or how she's even lived to be 93.
[02:57:01.557 --> 02:57:02.618]  I think she just turned 93.
[02:57:03.939 --> 02:57:06.020]  You know, I've got stacks of news I didn't get to.
[02:57:06.180 --> 02:57:12.165]  NASA warns spectacular beauty and the beast could wreak havoc on Earth.
[02:57:12.786 --> 02:57:13.026]  What?
[02:57:14.487 --> 02:57:17.870]  So, um, admire the beauty but fear the beast.
[02:57:18.886 --> 02:57:23.070]  As a pretty amazing aurora is spotted in the northern hemisphere.
[02:57:23.110 --> 02:57:24.371]  NASA says to fear it, though.
[02:57:24.551 --> 02:57:26.033]  I don't know what they know or don't know.
[02:57:26.853 --> 02:57:31.838]  And then the UN says one million species at risk of extinction due to humans.
[02:57:31.898 --> 02:57:32.318]  Well, yeah.
[02:57:32.558 --> 02:57:35.221]  So I guess we should... Humans should probably just die then, actually.
[02:57:35.441 --> 02:57:39.946]  You know, there's been a long rumor about Chelsea Clinton being Webb Hubble's daughter.
[02:57:40.406 --> 02:57:44.050]  Chelsea Clinton put out a picture that looks like Webb Hubble, but I have a new theory.
[02:57:44.630 --> 02:57:48.454]  Chelsea Clinton is not Webb Hubble and Hillary Clinton's daughter.
[02:57:48.594 --> 02:57:50.997]  Chelsea Clinton is Webb Hubble and Bill Clinton's daughter.
[02:57:53.635 --> 02:58:00.380]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[02:58:00.400 --> 02:58:03.562]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[02:58:04.062 --> 02:58:05.023]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[02:58:05.683 --> 02:58:07.885]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[02:58:08.385 --> 02:58:09.366]  You're our only sponsors.
[02:58:09.866 --> 02:58:15.910]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[02:58:16.350 --> 02:58:18.272]  So remember, you are the InfoWarp.
[02:58:18.832 --> 02:58:19.533]  I'm not the leader.
[02:58:19.853 --> 02:58:20.454]  You are the leader.
[02:58:20.654 --> 02:58:22.255]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[02:58:22.616 --> 02:58:27.380]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWareStore.com that are unprecedented.
[02:58:28.041 --> 02:58:35.488]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[02:58:35.508 --> 02:58:36.830]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[02:58:37.210 --> 02:58:39.051]  I cannot believe we even produced this.
[02:58:39.071 --> 02:58:40.432]  I mean, this, this, this is insane.
[02:58:40.612 --> 02:58:42.193]  I said, I'm a game changer.
[02:58:42.213 --> 02:58:42.573]  I'm a guru.
[02:58:42.593 --> 02:58:42.913]  I'm a scientist.
[02:59:05.256 --> 02:59:08.699]  I'm an activist, and, and, and, and other people aren't willing to do it.
[02:59:08.779 --> 02:59:12.482]  And, and, and, and I'll tell you right now, I'm here to ram heads with you.
[02:59:12.502 --> 02:59:16.765]  Synergy drinks are bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[02:59:16.966 --> 02:59:18.287]  Well, it's not me, it's you.
[02:59:18.307 --> 02:59:20.769]  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[02:59:20.809 --> 02:59:22.250]  Gosh, it's bad.
[02:59:22.450 --> 02:59:24.772]  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[02:59:24.912 --> 02:59:26.353]  Now, did you hear what I just said?
[02:59:26.453 --> 02:59:29.096]  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[02:59:29.536 --> 02:59:31.377]  Grr, gosh, it's on.
[02:59:31.738 --> 02:59:32.238]  Workout.
[02:59:33.019 --> 02:59:34.340]  So let me just workout.
[02:59:49.868 --> 02:59:50.628]  I think this is good.
[02:59:55.193 --> 03:00:01.099]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:12.183 --> 03:00:14.364]  Alright, I have specific requests.
[03:00:14.704 --> 03:00:15.404]  You found it.
[03:00:15.464 --> 03:00:16.805]  The tip of the spear.
[03:00:16.925 --> 03:00:21.566]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[03:00:22.747 --> 03:00:26.568]  So look, I have specific requests to explain here.
[03:00:27.168 --> 03:00:30.229]  The crew was not happy with me to just kind of leave this on a cliffhanger.
[03:00:30.849 --> 03:00:38.792]  Chelsea Clinton puts out a tweet and you know honestly I kind of feel bad for Chelsea Clinton but but this is a message to Chelsea Clinton.
[03:00:41.977 --> 03:00:42.497]  I'm sorry.
[03:00:44.098 --> 03:00:50.599]  I thought that you were the daughter of Webb Hubble and Hillary Clinton.
[03:00:52.660 --> 03:01:01.622]  But it's clear to me now, after putting this picture out, you put this picture out on Twitter, it's clear to me now, Chelsea, that I was wrong.
[03:01:02.022 --> 03:01:05.383]  You're not the daughter of Hillary Clinton and Webb Hubble.
[03:01:05.863 --> 03:01:09.684]  You're actually the daughter of Bill Clinton and Webb Hubble.
[03:01:14.582 --> 03:01:18.484]  You know, you could do, and people have done this, and it's kind of funny.
[03:01:18.504 --> 03:01:29.371]  I mean, you know, do your eyes deceive you type of thing, but there's so many, let's just say, children out of wedlock.
[03:01:30.351 --> 03:01:31.732]  Chelsea Clinton is one example.
[03:01:31.772 --> 03:01:33.013]  There's other famous examples.
[03:01:34.094 --> 03:01:34.934]  I mean, hey, I don't know.
[03:01:34.954 --> 03:01:38.596]  I've never done the DNA test on Chelsea Clinton, but boy, that'd be interesting.
[03:01:38.616 --> 03:01:39.637]  You'd think she might want to know.
[03:01:41.127 --> 03:01:48.051]  Or maybe, you know, one of the other famous ones is that Khloe Kardashian is the daughter of OJ Simpson.
[03:01:48.171 --> 03:01:52.753]  I mean, and you look at Khloe, and she's clearly different than the rest of the Kardashians.
[03:01:52.773 --> 03:01:55.835]  I mean, she's built like OJ Simpson, you know, a football player.
[03:01:56.375 --> 03:02:01.958]  And then you look at OJ Simpson's kids and compare them to Khloe, and you're like, oh, that's pretty much the exact same person.
[03:02:01.978 --> 03:02:05.440]  But, you know, I don't do the DNA test, but those are just some examples.
[03:02:05.480 --> 03:02:07.882]  But why?
[03:02:08.462 --> 03:02:09.803]  Why do we have people lying about
[03:02:11.084 --> 03:02:11.887]  Who their kids are?
[03:02:11.927 --> 03:02:15.117]  Well, they want you to think that they're all on the up and up.
[03:02:17.073 --> 03:02:20.855]  But you wonder how many kids old Billy Boy had that weren't Hillary's.
[03:02:21.675 --> 03:02:24.657]  He ignores Danny Williams, but that's because of Hillary's racism.
[03:02:25.237 --> 03:02:27.138]  But anyway, Chelsea Clinton, I apologize.
[03:02:27.158 --> 03:02:30.160]  You're clearly not the daughter of Hillary Clinton and Webb Hubble.
[03:02:31.220 --> 03:02:36.483]  You're actually born out of Webb Hubble and the daughter of Bill Clinton from Webb Hubble.
[03:02:37.524 --> 03:02:38.624]  So actually, congratulations.
[03:02:38.644 --> 03:02:41.005]  You might actually be the first woman born of two men.
[03:02:42.984 --> 03:02:45.026]  Let's just do a news blitz and then Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[03:02:45.806 --> 03:02:49.069]  Apple face recognition blamed by New York teen for false arrest.
[03:02:49.389 --> 03:02:52.171]  Oh, the Apple face recognition, not as good as they thought.
[03:02:52.352 --> 03:02:53.673]  They said it was impossible to hack it.
[03:02:54.353 --> 03:02:54.934]  That's not true.
[03:02:54.974 --> 03:02:58.377]  It turns out it's pretty much easily hackable if you have a similar face.
[03:02:59.037 --> 03:02:59.577]  But it doesn't matter.
[03:02:59.597 --> 03:03:00.358]  They've got to roll this out.
[03:03:00.398 --> 03:03:04.822]  It's all about security and then they're just going to sell all the facial recognition data to big government.
[03:03:05.863 --> 03:03:09.726]  Google spin-off drone delivery business first to get FAA approval.
[03:03:11.247 --> 03:03:12.308]  I wonder how Alphabet's
[03:03:14.201 --> 03:03:19.508]  Offshoot of a drone delivery business got the first FAA approval.
[03:03:21.290 --> 03:03:21.931]  Corporate privilege.
[03:03:22.251 --> 03:03:23.433]  Coming to store shelves.
[03:03:23.493 --> 03:03:25.676]  Cameras that guessed your age and sex.
[03:03:27.458 --> 03:03:28.139]  That should be fun.
[03:03:28.159 --> 03:03:30.682]  A nice AI robot to tell you what to buy.
[03:03:31.516 --> 03:03:36.922]  Oh, I just can't wait to go to the store and the AI bot tells me how old I am and probably tells me what health I'm in, too.
[03:03:36.982 --> 03:03:38.163]  Probably tells me I need a vaccine.
[03:03:38.644 --> 03:03:40.386]  Oh, hi, Mr. Schreuer.
[03:03:41.187 --> 03:03:42.729]  You need a vaccine.
[03:03:43.509 --> 03:03:44.470]  Oh, yes, AI.
[03:03:44.791 --> 03:03:46.272]  Please save me.
[03:03:46.953 --> 03:03:49.556]  Facebook's new chief lawyer helped write the Patriot Act.
[03:03:50.137 --> 03:03:51.839]  Oh, I'm sure Jennifer Neustadt's
[03:03:53.143 --> 03:03:59.012]  Experience and knowledge of the Patriot Act had nothing to do with her being employed at Facebook.
[03:03:59.052 --> 03:04:02.497]  Now, Jack Dorsey admits Twitter's like button should have never existed.
[03:04:02.637 --> 03:04:04.139]  Yeah, because it's... Here's the thing.
[03:04:05.305 --> 03:04:07.266]  Conservatives are actually coming up right now.
[03:04:07.366 --> 03:04:10.689]  Conservative content makers and conservative commentators and stuff.
[03:04:10.869 --> 03:04:12.170]  The left has nothing to offer.
[03:04:12.730 --> 03:04:16.853]  And Twitter is basically one of the platforms where this is happening.
[03:04:16.873 --> 03:04:18.294]  And it happens because people like it.
[03:04:18.354 --> 03:04:19.234]  They build other people up.
[03:04:19.294 --> 03:04:20.035]  Other people can find them.
[03:04:20.235 --> 03:04:21.196]  Twitter doesn't want this to happen.
[03:04:21.256 --> 03:04:23.417]  Twitter is sick of seeing all these successful conservatives.
[03:04:23.797 --> 03:04:26.759]  Twitter is sick of seeing people like Paul Joseph Watson dominate Twitter.
[03:04:27.080 --> 03:04:31.302]  So they want to get rid of the like button and everything.
[03:04:31.342 --> 03:04:34.945]  So Paul, you know, you're too successful on Twitter.
[03:04:35.966 --> 03:04:40.329]  You're too good, you get too many likes, so we're just going to remove the like button, okay?
[03:04:40.369 --> 03:04:45.814]  So from now on, when you put out a video that gets 50,000 likes and it goes viral, we're just going to shut that down, Paul.
[03:04:46.174 --> 03:04:46.715]  Okay, Paul?
[03:04:46.735 --> 03:04:47.355]  Are you okay with that?
[03:04:47.395 --> 03:04:48.136]  Can we shut that down?
[03:04:48.917 --> 03:04:49.837]  Sounds good to me, Owen.
[03:04:50.118 --> 03:04:50.698]  Thank you, Paul.
[03:04:50.718 --> 03:04:54.682]  Alright, so Paul is too successful on Twitter, so we're going to have to shut down Paul's likes.
[03:04:55.542 --> 03:05:00.046]  So we're going to get rid of the like button because it's advantageous for conservatives.
[03:05:00.066 --> 03:05:01.868]  So Paul Joseph Watson takes over on the other side.
[03:05:03.981 --> 03:05:07.145]  Brain Force Plus is a top-tier nootropin.
[03:05:07.906 --> 03:05:08.346]  Focus.

[03:06:11.864 --> 03:06:13.365]  The tip of the spear.
[03:06:13.906 --> 03:06:16.348]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:16.908 --> 03:06:20.992]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:06:22.453 --> 03:06:22.993]  We are live.
[03:06:23.093 --> 03:06:28.318]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show on this April 23rd, 2019 edition.
[03:06:28.958 --> 03:06:36.785]  Obviously today, the BBC is reporting as of four hours ago, Donald Trump's state visit to the UK set for the 3rd of June.
[03:06:37.657 --> 03:06:48.426]  Of course, this was promised by Prime Minister Theresa May, who, for some godforsaken reason, is still the Prime Minister of the UK, back when Trump was elected in 2016, but no date was set.
[03:06:48.846 --> 03:06:53.290]  Trump did visit the UK on a working visit in July 2018.
[03:06:53.370 --> 03:07:02.397]  That's when they had the big temper tantrum, you remember, with the Trump baby balloon, which was dwarfed by the Sadiq Khan baby balloon.
[03:07:02.878 --> 03:07:06.501]  So they had their big protest, their big temper tantrum, back last summer.
[03:07:07.552 --> 03:07:13.555]  But now it's been announced that Donald Trump will make a three-day state visit to the UK from 3rd to 5th of June.
[03:07:13.975 --> 03:07:22.820]  Buckingham Palace has announced the President, First Lady Melania Trump will be guest of the Queen and attend a ceremony in Portsmouth to mark 75 years since the D-Day landings.
[03:07:23.200 --> 03:07:24.581]  How dare they?
[03:07:24.961 --> 03:07:30.844]  The Labour Party in the United Kingdom, which is the equivalent of the Democrats, the leftists, are not happy.
[03:07:31.753 --> 03:07:45.361]  And now you have some of the same people who literally want ISIS jihadists to return to the UK, but they don't want the leader of the free world and our number one ally to enter the country.
[03:07:45.842 --> 03:07:47.843]  Literally, it's got to that level.
[03:07:48.403 --> 03:07:59.490]  Headline up on Infowars.com, Labour MP who said ISIS brides should come back, in her own words, to UK wants to ban President Trump from state visit.
[03:08:00.600 --> 03:08:08.166]  This is left-wing Labour MP Rupert Hooke, who said that ISIS bride Shemima Begum should come back to the UK.
[03:08:10.107 --> 03:08:18.033]  And she's now calling for President Donald Trump to be banned from entering the country on a state visit because of, you guessed it, racism!
[03:08:19.174 --> 03:08:29.362]  So she gave an interview back in February to a radio station, this left-wing Labour MP, and said that Shemima Begum should have her citizenship returned to her
[03:08:30.228 --> 03:08:32.509]  And she should be allowed to come back to the UK.
[03:08:32.549 --> 03:08:33.830]  Who was Shemima Begum?
[03:08:34.290 --> 03:08:41.934]  Oh, she was the poor 16-year-old girl who was groomed and radicalised and was made to go to Syria to fight alongside ISIS.
[03:08:42.014 --> 03:08:44.515]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:08:44.535 --> 03:08:45.696]  No, that's not what happened.
[03:08:46.536 --> 03:08:51.739]  She was literally an enforcer alongside ISIS jihadists in Syria.
[03:08:52.019 --> 03:08:58.122]  She pointed automatic weapons at women in Syria for, quote, wearing brightly coloured shoes.
[03:08:58.945 --> 03:09:01.107]  This is the ISIS bride Shamima Begum.
[03:09:01.548 --> 03:09:10.596]  She literally sewed explosives into suicide vests to make sure that they would detonate if the suicide vest was taken off.
[03:09:11.237 --> 03:09:14.480]  This is the poor baby who was groomed and radicalized.
[03:09:14.580 --> 03:09:15.661]  It's totally not her fault.
[03:09:16.082 --> 03:09:20.086]  No, she was enthusiastic about joining ISIS.
[03:09:20.426 --> 03:09:21.347]  And then she came back
[03:09:22.279 --> 03:09:26.922]  A few months ago to the UK media with this big sob story and they all believed it.
[03:09:27.422 --> 03:09:39.469]  It later came out that in fact she said during those very interviews she was not fazed by seeing decapitated heads in trash cans because the victims were enemies of Islam.
[03:09:39.869 --> 03:09:41.390]  So maybe they deserved it.
[03:09:42.170 --> 03:09:43.131]  So this is the woman.
[03:09:44.275 --> 03:09:55.623]  Shemima Begum, that this Labour MP wants to see returned to the UK, and she said in this interview that she's had trial by media and that she's really not that much of a bad person, come on!
[03:09:55.903 --> 03:10:00.947]  Who hasn't seen a bit decapitated head in a trash can and thought, well, they probably deserved it?
[03:10:01.867 --> 03:10:02.828]  Let them back in!
[03:10:04.149 --> 03:10:11.054]  So Shemima Begum's currently going through an appeal process with Legal Aid and she's put out this sob story and the left has rallied behind her.
[03:10:11.773 --> 03:10:12.954]  She's allowed back in.
[03:10:13.514 --> 03:10:16.816]  Returning ISIS jihadists are allowed back in to reintegrate.
[03:10:17.137 --> 03:10:22.340]  But Donald Trump, the President of the United States of America, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:10:22.600 --> 03:10:23.561]  He can't come in.
[03:10:24.581 --> 03:10:31.766]  So they've put out this parliamentary notion, which is backed by this Labour MP, Rupert Hook.
[03:10:32.066 --> 03:10:32.907]  I'm going to read it now.
[03:10:33.127 --> 03:10:37.710]  This is why Donald Trump shouldn't be allowed to enter the UK on a state visit, according to them.
[03:10:39.295 --> 03:10:45.602]  It says this House deplores the record of US President Donald Trump, including his misogynism, which isn't even a word.
[03:10:45.822 --> 03:10:46.904]  The word is misogyny.
[03:10:47.004 --> 03:10:48.245]  They can't even get the word right.
[03:10:48.585 --> 03:10:50.187]  Racism and xenophobia.
[03:10:50.948 --> 03:10:54.032]  Condemns his previous comments on women, refugees and torture.
[03:10:54.973 --> 03:10:57.155]  Again, providing no actual examples.
[03:10:58.216 --> 03:10:59.638]  Condemns his lack of action.
[03:11:00.575 --> 03:11:03.856]  On climate change and failure to support the Paris climate change deal.
[03:11:03.876 --> 03:11:09.857]  So because he doesn't believe in the fairy tale of man-made global warming, he shouldn't be allowed to come in on a state visit.
[03:11:10.637 --> 03:11:15.158]  If he'd fled to Syria and literally joined ISIS, then maybe they'd give him a fairer hearing.
[03:11:16.458 --> 03:11:17.118]  It continues.
[03:11:17.618 --> 03:11:23.639]  The motion condemns his sharing of online content related to a far-right extremist organization in the UK.
[03:11:23.999 --> 03:11:26.620]  That was the infamous retweets of Britain first.
[03:11:27.480 --> 03:11:27.820]  Okay, so
[03:11:28.991 --> 03:11:33.714]  Sewing explosives into a suicide vest for ISIS jihadists?
[03:11:34.074 --> 03:11:34.695]  That's fine.
[03:11:35.055 --> 03:11:36.676]  Retweeting Britain first?
[03:11:37.136 --> 03:11:38.477]  No, you're not coming in.
[03:11:39.078 --> 03:11:40.639]  That's extremist behaviour.
[03:11:41.079 --> 03:11:44.001]  Retweeting a right-wing group on the internet?
[03:11:44.701 --> 03:11:45.722]  That's extremist.
[03:11:46.262 --> 03:11:49.164]  Seeing decapitated heads in bins and not being fazed by it?
[03:11:49.384 --> 03:11:50.005]  That's fine.
[03:11:50.565 --> 03:11:55.328]  Pointing machine guns at women for wearing brightly coloured clothing and shoes?
[03:11:55.908 --> 03:11:56.549]  That's fine.
[03:11:57.748 --> 03:12:00.110]  But you retweet Brynfus, you're not coming in.
[03:12:01.371 --> 03:12:02.532]  The motion continues.
[03:12:03.692 --> 03:12:06.134]  They condemn his comments about the Mayor of London.
[03:12:06.975 --> 03:12:12.038]  Aww, he was mean to Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, therefore he can't come in.
[03:12:13.559 --> 03:12:19.644]  Notes previous motions and debates in the House of Parliament, including on the withholding of the honour of a joint address to the Houses of Parliament.
[03:12:20.307 --> 03:12:32.430]  Further notes the historical significance and honour that comes with the choice to offer a full state visit to an individual and calls on Prime Minister and the Government to rescind the offer of a full state visit to President Trump.
[03:12:33.390 --> 03:12:44.833]  So maybe if Trump had just joined ISIS and literally created suicide explosive vests like the ones used in Sri Lanka to kill nearly 300 people, they wouldn't have a problem with that.
[03:12:45.396 --> 03:12:52.918]  But because he's, quote, racist, with no examples provided, because he's, quote, misogynist, or what was the word they used that they made up?
[03:12:53.999 --> 03:12:55.659]  Misogynism, not even a word.
[03:12:57.339 --> 03:12:57.980]  That's bad.
[03:12:58.080 --> 03:12:59.180]  That's extremist.
[03:12:59.440 --> 03:13:05.582]  Because he made an offhand comment about they let you grab them by the pussy 14 years ago.
[03:13:06.322 --> 03:13:07.422]  That's extremist.
[03:13:08.123 --> 03:13:09.843]  That means he can't come into the country.
[03:13:10.363 --> 03:13:12.464]  And listen to what she also said, this Labour MP.
[03:13:14.725 --> 03:13:19.447]  Hook, she said Trump's visit would not be conducive to good race relations in the country.
[03:13:20.187 --> 03:13:29.110]  So they're literally saying some brown people might be offended so the President of the United States and the UK's number one ally shouldn't be allowed into the country.
[03:13:29.550 --> 03:13:35.672]  Of course the vast majority of people who are offended by this are idiot middle-class leftists.
[03:13:37.259 --> 03:13:55.872]  The same kind of leftists who are out on the streets with this ridiculous Extinction Rebellion, telling us how to live our lives, telling us not to use plastic straws, telling us not to use cars, while they literally fly off on their skiing holidays, paid for by Daddy, on a bi-monthly basis!
[03:13:55.892 --> 03:14:03.677]  It was Emma Thompson literally flying 5,000 miles from LA to London to join a climate protest.
[03:14:04.117 --> 03:14:05.358]  Absolutely absurd.
[03:14:06.531 --> 03:14:15.855]  So you literally have a bunch of Labour MPs who have advocated returning ISIS jihadists to come back to the UK.
[03:14:16.456 --> 03:14:29.282]  They've advocated the return of Shemima Begum, who was part of this Hizba Enforcement Group, which handed out brutal punishments to those found flouting ISIS laws on how to dress and behave.
[03:14:29.682 --> 03:14:30.942]  That's not extremist.
[03:14:31.743 --> 03:14:34.584]  Literally creating suicide explosive vests.
[03:14:34.984 --> 03:14:36.145]  That's not extremist.
[03:14:36.829 --> 03:14:41.671]  Seeing decapitated heads in trash cans and saying, well, they were enemies of Islam, who gives a damn anyway.
[03:14:42.171 --> 03:14:43.332]  That's not extremist.
[03:14:43.832 --> 03:14:50.155]  But Donald Trump said they let you grab them by the pussy 14 years ago and retweeted Britain first.
[03:14:50.495 --> 03:14:51.515]  That's extremist.
[03:14:51.575 --> 03:14:55.437]  And it doesn't matter if literally we're begging for a trade deal with America.
[03:14:56.900 --> 03:15:01.462]  Because Theresa May has been so cowardly in her dealings with the EU with Brexit.
[03:15:01.762 --> 03:15:02.623]  That doesn't matter.
[03:15:03.043 --> 03:15:07.865]  The fact that he's our number one ally in America has been our number one ally for decades and decades and generations.
[03:15:07.905 --> 03:15:08.645]  That doesn't matter.
[03:15:08.985 --> 03:15:11.126]  No, he shouldn't be allowed into the country.
[03:15:11.747 --> 03:15:13.007]  Absolutely absurd.
[03:15:13.587 --> 03:15:18.089]  It's a kind of a cliche now to say that, you know, they hate their own country.
[03:15:18.170 --> 03:15:19.310]  What else could you say?
[03:15:19.390 --> 03:15:23.512]  But they hate their own country when they literally give more sympathy
[03:15:24.278 --> 03:15:30.086]  To individuals who have joined the most notorious, bloodthirsty terrorist group on the planet.
[03:15:30.466 --> 03:15:39.437]  The terrorist group which has just claimed responsibility for killing 290 people, many of them Christians, injuring 500 or more in Sri Lanka.
[03:15:41.525 --> 03:15:43.667]  Those people can come back into the UK.
[03:15:44.067 --> 03:15:46.289]  Donald Trump can go and sling his hook.
[03:15:46.789 --> 03:15:54.555]  Because racism and misogyny and xenophobia, absolutely clown world, absurd, ludicrous.
[03:15:55.095 --> 03:15:57.417]  We'll be back in the next segment to get into it more.
[03:15:57.938 --> 03:16:01.700]  And other news, this is the Alex Jones Show live breaking news at Infowars.com.
[03:16:01.741 --> 03:16:02.181]  We'll be back.
[03:16:04.258 --> 03:16:08.701]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:16:08.922 --> 03:16:13.625]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[03:16:14.226 --> 03:16:20.070]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[03:16:20.490 --> 03:16:33.100]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, let's make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you can actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[03:16:33.840 --> 03:16:40.947]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues.
[03:16:40.967 --> 03:16:42.549]  He writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[03:16:42.569 --> 03:16:44.431]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[03:16:44.771 --> 03:16:45.932]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[03:16:45.952 --> 03:16:47.194]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[03:16:47.374 --> 03:16:48.575]  He doesn't drink anything.
[03:16:48.695 --> 03:16:50.255]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[03:16:50.755 --> 03:16:52.356]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[03:16:52.376 --> 03:16:54.176]  I only have to take one knockout.
[03:16:54.516 --> 03:16:57.137]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[03:16:57.177 --> 03:16:58.037]  This is insane.
[03:16:58.437 --> 03:17:00.057]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[03:17:00.297 --> 03:17:02.858]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[03:17:03.318 --> 03:17:04.838]  He says, this is totally free.
[03:17:04.878 --> 03:17:06.699]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[03:17:06.719 --> 03:17:08.579]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[03:17:09.439 --> 03:17:15.361]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[03:17:15.621 --> 03:17:16.961]  All just moderate dose.
[03:17:18.493 --> 03:17:26.482]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us a Mother Nature, is incredible.
[03:17:26.502 --> 03:17:28.905]  So, that's available infullwarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:17:28.925 --> 03:17:30.086]  But thank you for committing.
[03:17:34.128 --> 03:17:36.970]  They get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[03:17:37.350 --> 03:17:39.952]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[03:17:39.972 --> 03:17:44.736]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[03:17:45.216 --> 03:17:51.320]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[03:17:51.360 --> 03:17:54.463]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[03:17:54.823 --> 03:17:56.104]  It's called reap what you sow.
[03:18:03.709 --> 03:18:12.598]  Let me just tell listeners about something that is the very best product for your telomeres, for your mitochondrial DNA, that's the antioxidant that's next level.
[03:18:12.778 --> 03:18:21.586]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, the amount of it in here, depending on the equation, something like 40 boxes of the same chemical that's naturally occurring in blueberries.
[03:18:21.767 --> 03:18:22.487]  It's ridiculous.
[03:18:22.627 --> 03:18:23.048]  The CoQ10, PPQ,
[03:18:24.309 --> 03:18:27.551]  We have the organically derived, and by that, it's not synthetic.
[03:18:27.812 --> 03:18:33.196]  Most of the stuff that you see on the shelves, a tiny bottle of PQQ or CoQ10, will be like 50 bucks, because even the synthetic is expensive.
[03:18:33.316 --> 03:18:35.417]  This is the organically derived.
[03:18:35.838 --> 03:18:36.758]  This is the real stuff.
[03:18:36.939 --> 03:18:48.367]  I want to warn you though, when I first started taking it five years ago, this is DNA Force Plus, when I cut my finger off like 15 years ago, they reattached the finger, and you can see that right there, where it cut off, it was hanging about a piece of skin right here.
[03:18:48.387 --> 03:18:50.089]  It doesn't cut cleanly like you see in the movies.
[03:18:50.689 --> 03:18:51.549]  And then tore it off.
[03:18:51.689 --> 03:18:53.230]  It was numb all the way up here.
[03:18:53.370 --> 03:18:55.511]  And the strangest thing is I started taking DNA force.
[03:18:55.731 --> 03:18:57.271]  The feeling came back in my finger.
[03:18:57.311 --> 03:18:58.812]  First it tingled, and it came back.
[03:18:59.012 --> 03:19:00.092]  I was like, this is incredible.
[03:19:00.152 --> 03:19:00.953]  But I'm going to warn you.
[03:19:01.173 --> 03:19:05.714]  Most people that have old injuries and where nerves have kind of died out, this isn't just regenerating your cells.
[03:19:05.874 --> 03:19:09.655]  This isn't just slowing the shrinkage of telomeres, which is the same thing as making them last longer.
[03:19:09.836 --> 03:19:12.156]  It really does regenerate nerves in many areas.
[03:19:12.396 --> 03:19:14.177]  So it's the building blocks.
[03:19:14.457 --> 03:19:15.357]  And it's the next level.
[03:19:15.417 --> 03:19:16.338]  It's the best you're going to get.
[03:19:16.478 --> 03:19:19.239]  I remember saying, what's the top selling thing like six years ago?
[03:19:19.259 --> 03:19:20.059]  We're getting into supplements.
[03:19:20.279 --> 03:19:22.141]  And well, it's PQQ and CoQ10.
[03:19:22.261 --> 03:19:27.487]  But mainly, people at grocery stores don't want to pay that, so they buy synthetic stuff that's still 50, 60 bucks for a little bottle.
[03:19:27.647 --> 03:19:33.174]  But at medical clinics, it's not prescription, but people are willing to pay, you know, 300, 400 bucks, and it's a 6, 7 times markup.
[03:19:35.196 --> 03:19:35.977]  We're good to go.
[03:20:05.825 --> 03:20:18.654]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.795 --> 03:20:22.117]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:20:22.237 --> 03:20:24.199]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:24.479 --> 03:20:28.442]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:30.419 --> 03:20:54.619]  We are back live on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show with breaking news up on InfoWars.com and of course, Summit.News, which I know today from looking at the Alexa site rankings, now has more traffic and is higher in the Alexa site rankings than Right Wing Watch, which is basically like 15 years old at this point.
[03:20:55.119 --> 03:20:56.380]  George Soros funding.
[03:20:56.921 --> 03:20:58.882]  Summit.News has been going for about three weeks.
[03:20:59.062 --> 03:20:59.743]  More traffic.
[03:21:00.618 --> 03:21:05.000]  That's just a little footnote that I'd like to install there in the broadcast.
[03:21:05.800 --> 03:21:08.421]  Headline up on summit.news and infowars.com.
[03:21:08.461 --> 03:21:11.983]  Sri Lanka attacks were response to New Zealand mosque massacre.
[03:21:13.083 --> 03:21:27.249]  This was in an address to the nation's parliament, where Sri Lanka's defence minister said that the Islamic terror attacks on luxury hotels and churches, which killed nearly 300 people and injured hundreds more, were a response to the New Zealand mosque shooting.
[03:21:28.283 --> 03:21:33.746]  He said investigations reveal this attack was carried out in response to the Christchurch mosque massacre in New Zealand on Muslims.
[03:21:34.227 --> 03:21:37.508]  There was a security lapse leading to this devastation in Sri Lanka.
[03:21:38.409 --> 03:21:46.654]  Of course, the Christchurch mosque massacre was carried out by a single, not-job, lunatic, white supremacist
[03:21:47.739 --> 03:22:02.743]  How that then necessitates a response which basically involves people walking into luxury hotels where mostly Sri Lankan people are eating their breakfast and blowing them to pieces doesn't really connect.
[03:22:03.323 --> 03:22:04.503]  But then again, what does?
[03:22:05.644 --> 03:22:07.524]  So they're saying it was a response to that.
[03:22:09.065 --> 03:22:14.126]  But then the New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, who likes to walk around in a hijab,
[03:22:15.186 --> 03:22:15.286]  Yeah.
[03:22:31.292 --> 03:22:36.854]  Islamic State claimed responsibility on Tuesday for the bomb attacks in Sri Lanka that killed 321 people.
[03:22:37.474 --> 03:22:39.175]  That figure's gone up evidently.
[03:22:39.635 --> 03:22:40.275]  It was 290 before.
[03:22:40.295 --> 03:22:45.837]  And what officials believe was retaliation for assaults on mosques in New Zealand.
[03:22:46.257 --> 03:22:58.682]  The claim issued through the group's AMAQ news agency was made after Sri Lanka said two domestic Islamist groups with suspected links to foreign militants were suspected to have been behind the attacks at three churches and four hotels.
[03:23:00.077 --> 03:23:12.200]  So basically, ISIS claims responsibility for a lot of stuff, not everything, not everything, but they do claim responsibility for the vast majority of major terror attacks.
[03:23:12.940 --> 03:23:18.342]  And now the Sri Lankan government is saying that it is ISIS, the New Zealand government is saying that it's not.
[03:23:18.942 --> 03:23:22.103]  But beside all that, what is most important about
[03:23:22.990 --> 03:23:33.079]  The aftermath of the horrific attack in Sri Lanka carried out by Muslim extremists is not the threat posed by Islamic terrorism, it's how the far-right reacted to it.
[03:23:33.520 --> 03:23:35.742]  Obviously that's the biggest threat, isn't it?
[03:23:37.023 --> 03:23:43.248]  Media worries about right-wing anger and violence against Muslims following Islamic terror attack in Sri Lanka.
[03:23:43.909 --> 03:23:46.691]  Following the slaughter of nearly 300 people, now more than 300 people,
[03:23:48.354 --> 03:23:49.274]  Many of them Christians.
[03:23:49.314 --> 03:23:56.556]  By Islamic terrorists in Sri Lanka, the mainstream media is worried about right-wing anger and violence against Muslims.
[03:23:57.156 --> 03:24:06.538]  So you had a Washington Post story yesterday entitled, Christianity Under Attack, Sri Lanka Church Bombing Stoke, Far-Right Anger in the West.
[03:24:06.658 --> 03:24:17.720]  So again, being angry about something, being angry about 300 plus people being slaughtered in cold blood by Islamic terrorists, that must mean you're far right!
[03:24:19.218 --> 03:24:26.423]  The article downplays the notion of Christianity being under attack as merely a theme for right-wing activists.
[03:24:26.903 --> 03:24:34.388]  Yeah, it's really a theme, isn't it, when, what is it, 105 Christian churches are attacked every single month.
[03:24:34.969 --> 03:24:41.293]  What is it, 345 Christians are killed as a result of their faith every single month.
[03:24:41.453 --> 03:24:44.215]  Oh no, but it's just a theme for right-wing activists.
[03:24:44.715 --> 03:24:47.297]  And their anger is what we should really be concerned about.
[03:24:48.743 --> 03:24:57.786]  Another article published by UK outlet LBC cites an analyst who worries that the Sri Lanka massacre may lead to further violence against Muslims.
[03:24:59.067 --> 03:25:00.367]  This has become part of the course.
[03:25:00.427 --> 03:25:05.309]  After every single Islamic terror attack, the media either victim blames or runs defence for Islam.
[03:25:06.425 --> 03:25:16.628]  And you'll note that after every single Islamic terror attack, there's no concern about, oh, what about the safety, after every white supremacist attack, I mean, oh, what about the safety of white people?
[03:25:16.988 --> 03:25:18.889]  No, they just blame all white people.
[03:25:20.689 --> 03:25:25.351]  The alternative, that Islam has an implicit problem with violence because of what is written in the Quran,
[03:25:26.630 --> 03:25:28.891]  And needs to be reformed is too difficult to stomach.
[03:25:29.232 --> 03:25:36.396]  Next time a right-wing lunatic shoots up a mosque, is the media going to publish stories hand-wringing with concern about the threat to white people or conservatives?
[03:25:36.756 --> 03:25:38.077]  Don't hold your breath.
[03:25:38.857 --> 03:25:43.159]  So again, we see this theme after every single major event, not even a terrorist attack.
[03:25:44.240 --> 03:25:47.382]  In fact, Peter J. Hassan tweeted this yesterday.
[03:25:48.217 --> 03:25:50.718]  White supremacist massacres Muslims in New Zealand?
[03:25:51.018 --> 03:25:52.438]  Let's talk about the far right.
[03:25:52.838 --> 03:25:53.858]  Notre Dame burns?
[03:25:54.218 --> 03:25:55.679]  Let's talk about the far right.
[03:25:56.019 --> 03:25:58.159]  Jihadist massacre Christians in Sri Lanka?
[03:25:58.859 --> 03:26:00.460]  Let's talk about the far right.
[03:26:01.020 --> 03:26:02.080]  That's your theme?
[03:26:02.920 --> 03:26:16.623]  Is the mainstream media being completely besotted and obsessed with how the right or the far right reacts to each one of these incidents, not asking serious questions about why these atrocities are happening in the first place?
[03:26:17.822 --> 03:26:19.462]  And we have another example of that here.
[03:26:20.542 --> 03:26:25.543]  BBC threats over nervous and afraid Muslims following Islamic terror attacks in Sri Lanka.
[03:26:26.323 --> 03:26:34.765]  Following attacks by Islamic terrorists that killed hundreds of people in Sri Lanka, BBC News expressed concern for, quote, nervous and afraid Muslims.
[03:26:35.485 --> 03:26:41.206]  This was in their live coverage of the aftermath of the bombings, which primarily targeted Catholic Christians.
[03:26:42.166 --> 03:26:46.307]  And they made a point of highlighting how Sri Lankan Muslims are left nervous and afraid.
[03:26:47.239 --> 03:26:55.027]  Who's going to be more nervous and afraid in Sri Lanka after they literally just killed 321 people and injured 500 plus more?
[03:26:55.488 --> 03:27:00.733]  After suicide bombers walked into Catholic churches and blew themselves up?
[03:27:01.735 --> 03:27:06.159]  After they're still finding, what was it, 80 other pipe bombs in a bus station?
[03:27:06.700 --> 03:27:07.541]  After they tried to
[03:27:08.328 --> 03:27:13.391]  Remote control detonate, another bomb that was parked in that van that we saw in the video yesterday which blew up.
[03:27:13.871 --> 03:27:17.693]  Who's going to be more nervous and afraid right now in Sri Lanka?
[03:27:18.013 --> 03:27:19.914]  I think it's going to be Christians, isn't it?
[03:27:20.635 --> 03:27:23.836]  Given that they're a minority, they're about 10% of the population.
[03:27:24.117 --> 03:27:25.757]  They're going to be nervous and afraid.
[03:27:26.078 --> 03:27:32.041]  How about we focus on, oh sorry, you can't call them Christians anymore, sorry, Easter worshippers.
[03:27:32.870 --> 03:27:34.011]  Don't use the C word.
[03:27:34.051 --> 03:27:36.453]  It's politically incorrect to call them Christians.
[03:27:36.793 --> 03:27:38.094]  They're Easter worshippers.
[03:27:38.535 --> 03:27:43.078]  Surely we should be worried about Easter worshippers being nervous and afraid.
[03:27:44.840 --> 03:27:51.325]  As we highlighted yesterday, instead of focusing on the perpetrators, some media outlets chose to make the issue about their reaction of the far right.
[03:27:52.326 --> 03:28:00.432]  Given that nearly 800 people, many of them Catholics, have just been killed or injured by Muslim extremists, is anyone concerned about... Again, that's the C word.
[03:28:00.452 --> 03:28:01.053]  I can't say it.
[03:28:01.353 --> 03:28:02.294]  Easter worshippers.
[03:28:04.375 --> 03:28:14.267]  David Vance made another good point talking about the state visit of Trump, which as I talked about in the previous segment, left-wing Labour MPs are now trying to get cancelled.
[03:28:14.868 --> 03:28:19.894]  The same left-wing Labour MPs that openly roll out the red carpet for returning ISIS jihadists.
[03:28:22.302 --> 03:28:28.684]  One of the reasons they cited for wanting to ban Donald Trump's state visit was that he was mean to the London Mayor Sadiq Khan.
[03:28:28.764 --> 03:28:31.544]  Boo-hoo, poor baby, hurt his fee-fees.
[03:28:32.184 --> 03:28:33.625]  David Vance tweets this.
[03:28:34.205 --> 03:28:42.707]  When 50 Muslims were murdered at the mosque in New Zealand, London Mayor Sadiq Khan instantly ordered extra policing to protect mosques in London.
[03:28:43.447 --> 03:28:50.809]  After 300 Christians are murdered in Sri Lanka, what additional policing resources has he made available to protect London's churches?
[03:28:51.559 --> 03:28:54.364]  And again, the Prime Minister of New Zealand donned a hijab.
[03:28:55.105 --> 03:28:56.928]  You know, the call to prayer rung out in major cities.
[03:28:56.969 --> 03:28:58.571]  Who's going to wear Christian crucifixes?
[03:28:58.852 --> 03:29:01.917]  Who's going to protect Christians in the aftermath of this attack?
[03:29:03.348 --> 03:29:10.092]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[03:29:10.693 --> 03:29:13.274]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.

[03:29:15.396 --> 03:29:17.577]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[03:29:18.077 --> 03:29:19.078]  You're our only sponsors.
[03:29:19.578 --> 03:29:25.602]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.

[03:30:15.562 --> 03:30:19.845]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[03:30:20.266 --> 03:30:23.508]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[03:30:24.429 --> 03:30:34.652]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[03:30:35.412 --> 03:30:43.955]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.

[03:30:59.848 --> 03:31:04.291]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:31:04.372 --> 03:31:04.692]  Go ahead.
[03:31:05.733 --> 03:31:07.235]  I just have to say something, man.
[03:31:07.255 --> 03:31:10.277]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:31:11.058 --> 03:31:12.159]  It just gets old, man.
[03:31:12.499 --> 03:31:14.221]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[03:31:14.921 --> 03:31:17.003]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:31:17.223 --> 03:31:21.226]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:31:21.246 --> 03:31:23.668]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:31:24.549 --> 03:31:26.871]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:31:27.231 --> 03:31:28.292]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[03:31:28.593 --> 03:31:29.473]  Us being shut down?
[03:31:29.693 --> 03:31:30.754]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:31:31.175 --> 03:31:32.216]  You know what, Alex?
[03:31:32.256 --> 03:31:33.337]  Put him on pause again.
[03:31:33.357 --> 03:31:34.177]  Hey, Frank!
[03:31:34.477 --> 03:31:39.822]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[03:31:40.122 --> 03:31:44.406]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:31:44.646 --> 03:31:47.508]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:31:47.769 --> 03:31:48.169]  You understand?
[03:31:48.249 --> 03:31:49.510]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:31:49.890 --> 03:31:51.011]  I need your help, Frank!

[03:34:04.167 --> 03:34:06.889]  Obviously, we've got the Turbo Force, which is one of my favorites.
[03:34:07.610 --> 03:34:08.631]  Be careful, though.
[03:34:09.271 --> 03:34:10.212]  It's best to take
[03:34:11.291 --> 03:34:24.920]  Half a sachet of that when you first try it out because it really is absolutely powerful in terms of giving you cognitive focus and waking you up without that junky feeling that you get from a lot of other energy drinks.
[03:34:25.460 --> 03:34:29.122]  We've also got Brain Force Plus available right now.

[03:35:44.975 --> 03:35:47.517]  Now let's get back into some of this news.
[03:35:47.578 --> 03:35:52.602]  I don't want to turn it into the Islam Hour, but I mean, there's a lot of news about Islam.
[03:35:53.331 --> 03:36:01.237]  Breitbart reports Germany 24 injured after confused Somali storms Easter mass while shouting pelting stones.
[03:36:01.878 --> 03:36:04.460]  This is a common occurrence in Germany and Sweden right now.
[03:36:05.041 --> 03:36:11.566]  More than 20 people were injured at a church in Germany after mass panic ensued when a mentally confused Somali
[03:36:12.333 --> 03:36:13.274]  Mentally confused.
[03:36:13.754 --> 03:36:16.916]  Stormed into an Easter service shouting and throwing stones.
[03:36:17.337 --> 03:36:32.607]  Two dozen people were treated for injuries, including four hospitalised with minor injuries after the 36-year-old suspect burst into St Paul's Church in Munich at 9.30pm Saturday, about an hour into the Easter vigil of its Croatian Catholic community.
[03:36:33.388 --> 03:36:40.753]  Local media said there was chaos when many of the approximately 500 people at the service were caught in a stampede to the church's exit
[03:36:41.610 --> 03:36:46.452]  With eyewitnesses recalling their terror as the intruder reportedly shouted and pelted stones.
[03:36:47.053 --> 03:36:51.235]  Remember in Europe we've had invasions of churches on a regular basis.
[03:36:51.935 --> 03:37:04.881]  France just had 875 churches targeted or burned in 2018 because you had the beheading of the priest in a church in Normandy back in I think it was 2016 or 2017.
[03:37:04.921 --> 03:37:05.942]  Now you had this incident
[03:37:09.838 --> 03:37:19.784]  Jozo Dramac, who attended the vigil with his wife and son, said he was still scared after the night's events, reporting that churchgoers became panicked when someone screaming in Arabic shouted, Allah!
[03:37:19.924 --> 03:37:20.264]  Allah!
[03:37:22.086 --> 03:37:30.951]  Now you would understand what they would probably think was going to happen next, given that that is the refrain, or versions of it, shouted before almost every single terrorist attack.
[03:37:31.671 --> 03:37:35.234]  Marko Vidovic, a teacher from Leim, talks about the incident on Saturday night.
[03:37:35.274 --> 03:37:35.614]  He said,
[03:37:36.445 --> 03:37:37.786]  I heard someone screaming loudly.
[03:37:37.846 --> 03:37:39.147]  The church was full of visitors.
[03:37:39.607 --> 03:37:41.869]  People have thrown themselves anxiously on the ground.
[03:37:41.949 --> 03:37:43.210]  Others have run and stumbled.
[03:37:43.310 --> 03:37:44.251]  Children screamed.
[03:37:45.392 --> 03:37:48.254]  So basically 24 people were treated for injuries.
[03:37:48.474 --> 03:37:49.895]  He was throwing fireworks.
[03:37:49.935 --> 03:37:51.036]  He was throwing stones.
[03:37:51.076 --> 03:37:51.876]  He was shouting.
[03:37:51.916 --> 03:37:52.757]  He was screaming.
[03:37:52.777 --> 03:37:54.178]  He was chanting Allah, Allah.
[03:37:56.279 --> 03:37:58.281]  You can understand why the people were scared.
[03:37:58.321 --> 03:38:00.983]  That happened on Saturday night in Germany.
[03:38:02.023 --> 03:38:06.945]  Of course, we had the burning of the Notre Dame Cathedral on Monday, which was just an accident.
[03:38:07.945 --> 03:38:27.852]  But they're still trying to claim, still, that the notion that Muslims celebrated the Notre Dame Cathedral burning, even though it was all over Facebook, literally every other comment, if you went on France 24 Arabic's Facebook page, or if you went on Al Jazeera's Facebook page, was people celebrating this fire.
[03:38:28.576 --> 03:38:30.097]  Welcoming it with glee.
[03:38:30.498 --> 03:38:32.099]  I documented that in my video.
[03:38:32.479 --> 03:38:43.568]  BuzzFeed completely lied and claimed that, oh, we didn't know what they were reacting to when there was literally a live feed video of Notre Dame burning in the background.
[03:38:43.868 --> 03:38:45.850]  Yes, we do know what they were reacting to.
[03:38:46.230 --> 03:38:47.411]  It was the Notre Dame fire.
[03:38:47.811 --> 03:38:55.057]  So eventually they had to backpedal and say, oh, well, emoticons, smiley faced emoticons don't mean anything.
[03:38:57.139 --> 03:38:57.459]  Really?
[03:38:58.248 --> 03:39:08.395]  So if you went on 4chan during the New Zealand Christchurch Massacre and had a bunch of people on 4chan celebrating that attack, which also happened... Oh, well that didn't mean anything!
[03:39:08.535 --> 03:39:09.276]  Yes it does!
[03:39:10.032 --> 03:39:11.352]  It's an absolute disgrace.
[03:39:11.873 --> 03:39:17.815]  There you see the list of people reacting to that live video feed with smiley faces.
[03:39:18.255 --> 03:39:19.995]  A lot of Muslim names in there.
[03:39:20.115 --> 03:39:21.076]  It's just a fact.
[03:39:21.436 --> 03:39:26.517]  A lot of them react with glee and in a celebratory fashion after every single event like this.
[03:39:26.938 --> 03:39:27.518]  It's a fact.
[03:39:27.558 --> 03:39:28.638]  You can't get away from it.
[03:39:28.918 --> 03:39:29.658]  It's a problem.
[03:39:30.239 --> 03:39:31.579]  Yet they're still denying it.
[03:39:32.759 --> 03:39:34.240]  This is a headline out of Sputnik.
[03:39:35.282 --> 03:39:40.187]  Guardian jumps on claim Sputnik edited Notre Dame fire photo despite disproof.
[03:39:41.028 --> 03:39:46.553]  So the Guardian put out this series of Instagram stories where they've got a woman stood in front of the text.
[03:39:47.254 --> 03:39:52.559]  Muslims celebrated the destruction of Notre Dame with a big sign saying fake with a poopy face on it.
[03:39:54.247 --> 03:39:57.048]  Oh, because she stood there with a sign, that must mean it's fake, right?
[03:39:57.409 --> 03:40:08.434]  No, you can still go to the Facebook pages, Al Jazeera, France 24 Arabic, translate the comments, read them directly celebrating the attack.
[03:40:08.754 --> 03:40:13.556]  I read out literally two dozen in that video about BuzzFeed I made last week.
[03:40:14.276 --> 03:40:15.537]  But now they've done it again.
[03:40:16.958 --> 03:40:21.640]  They're claiming that this photo, which you can see at the top of this article in Sputnik,
[03:40:22.890 --> 03:40:24.572]  Was doctored, was fake.
[03:40:24.832 --> 03:40:36.322]  It shows two individuals of, it looks like Arabic descent, smiling as they go past a police cordon with Notre Dame burning in the background.
[03:40:36.917 --> 03:40:48.184]  They claim that this is a fake image because something on one of the cheeks of one of these guys doesn't look right and it shows, quote, obvious editing if you zoom into the picture.
[03:40:48.564 --> 03:40:53.067]  So with no evidence that this was faked whatsoever, they claim that this was a hoax.
[03:40:53.807 --> 03:41:04.194]  So what Sputnik did, and this is where they talk about it, Sputnik friends commented on the grievous allegations and the website's chief editor, Natalia Novikova,
[03:41:04.955 --> 03:41:09.097]  Calling for responsibility in journalism, the outlet has also put the original photo.
[03:41:09.658 --> 03:41:15.401]  So Sputnik got this original photo which they took and included in their live coverage of the Notre Dame fire.
[03:41:17.102 --> 03:41:25.347]  Where the metadata indicating when and how the pictures were made can be accessed after downloading the image and they've got a link to it which you can click.
[03:41:25.727 --> 03:41:33.051]  So they've got the actual metadata within this high quality image where you can go to the source and it was their photograph
[03:41:33.763 --> 03:41:37.666]  So the media ran with this and I think BuzzFeed tried to claim that this was fake as well.
[03:41:38.066 --> 03:41:51.956]  Now the Guardian still over a week later is still claiming that this photograph of these two individuals who other people have claimed shows them celebrating or at least pleased or at least smiling about the fire in the background was fake.
[03:41:52.056 --> 03:41:53.057]  It's not fake!
[03:41:53.928 --> 03:41:59.491]  They've literally released the original photo with the metadata that anyone can go and check.
[03:41:59.851 --> 03:42:04.573]  And the Guardian Buzzfeed is still putting out articles saying that this was a fake photo.
[03:42:04.873 --> 03:42:07.914]  By the way, this is not the only photo of a similar nature.
[03:42:08.315 --> 03:42:09.895]  I included another one in my video.
[03:42:10.396 --> 03:42:11.536]  It's not fake.
[03:42:11.996 --> 03:42:17.359]  Just like the comments on France 24, Arabic and Al Jazeera were not fake.
[03:42:17.479 --> 03:42:22.101]  They were real comments by real people celebrating the Notre Dame fire.
[03:42:23.047 --> 03:42:28.511]  So we've got this entire narrative, Muslims celebrating the destruction of Notre Dame was fake.
[03:42:28.651 --> 03:42:29.672]  It wasn't fake!
[03:42:31.133 --> 03:42:41.461]  They literally put a yellow sticker on this BuzzFeed tweet with my claim, my claim, that they were celebrating the fire and they put a yellow sticker on it and said fake.
[03:42:42.165 --> 03:42:43.527]  Oh, that must mean it's fake then.
[03:42:43.627 --> 03:42:44.648]  No, you're fake!
[03:42:45.149 --> 03:42:53.540]  You put out a fake news story because you were completely proven wrong on this issue and now the Guardian has fallen for the exact same trick.
[03:42:54.398 --> 03:43:01.861]  And they're going to be left with egg on their face, which is why they're going bust, just like BuzzFeed, going out of business, because they lie to their audience.
[03:43:02.461 --> 03:43:04.362]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us.
[03:43:04.622 --> 03:43:07.443]  And it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[03:43:07.663 --> 03:43:15.226]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:43:16.226 --> 03:43:18.787]  Some of the most polluted areas on Earth are major cities.
[03:43:19.207 --> 03:43:20.548]  How can I solve that problem?
[03:43:20.929 --> 03:43:34.221]  So we have air filters at InfowarsStore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology.

[03:45:02.349 --> 03:45:05.210]  The right wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified.
[03:45:05.230 --> 03:45:06.310]  1776 will commence again if you try to take off firearms!
[03:45:06.331 --> 03:45:06.891]  That man is Alex Jones.
[03:45:06.911 --> 03:45:08.851]  He's one of those guys who believes that Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[03:45:08.871 --> 03:45:09.512]  I heard it on Alex Jones!

[03:45:38.587 --> 03:45:42.230]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[03:45:42.311 --> 03:45:45.453]  InfoWars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[03:45:45.694 --> 03:45:46.915]  Alex Jones, nice guy.
[03:45:47.015 --> 03:45:48.076]  InfoWars.com!
[03:45:48.596 --> 03:45:49.437]  InfoWars.
[03:45:49.597 --> 03:45:50.298]  InfoWars.
[03:45:50.438 --> 03:45:51.039]  InfoWars.
[03:45:51.119 --> 03:45:51.759]  InfoWars.
[03:45:51.799 --> 03:45:53.421]  What's happened with InfoWars?
[03:45:53.561 --> 03:45:57.004]  I would love it if you would follow up also about Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[03:45:57.124 --> 03:46:01.148]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[03:46:01.288 --> 03:46:02.789]  You didn't call me to testify in America.
[03:46:02.849 --> 03:46:04.290]  I have a right to face my accusers.
[03:46:04.730 --> 03:46:07.111]  And you, Congressman Deutch, are a liar and a fraud.
[03:46:07.211 --> 03:46:12.114]  I know we had Alex Jones in the room earlier, promoting conspiracy theories.
[03:46:12.274 --> 03:46:17.417]  InfoWars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[03:46:17.538 --> 03:46:21.180]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment.
[03:46:21.260 --> 03:46:24.261]  InfoWars just lost their war on info.
[03:46:24.322 --> 03:46:28.304]  Yesterday, Apple, iTunes, Vimeo, and Spotify, YouTube, Twitter,
[03:46:28.564 --> 03:46:31.725]  Facebook have all blocked Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[03:46:31.765 --> 03:46:35.047]  Who is the most banned news network in the world?
[03:46:35.107 --> 03:46:36.167]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[03:46:36.307 --> 03:46:38.929]  Alex Jones has now been taken off Facebook, thank God.
[03:46:38.949 --> 03:46:41.570]  CNN waged a long campaign against Jones.
[03:46:41.710 --> 03:46:42.250]  It worked.
[03:46:42.750 --> 03:46:45.531]  Jeff Zucker silenced and deplatformed his show.
[03:46:45.732 --> 03:46:48.093]  It was a stunning defeat for free speech.
[03:46:48.373 --> 03:46:53.255]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.

[03:49:17.637 --> 03:49:21.000]  Now another story up on Summit.News and InfoWars.com.
[03:49:21.561 --> 03:49:25.265]  Activists dressed as clowns protest Drag Queen Story Hour.
[03:49:25.645 --> 03:49:33.193]  Yes, that's right, Drag Queen Story Hour is still taking place, despite the fact that a bunch of pedos have been connected to it.
[03:49:33.873 --> 03:49:38.278]  Activists dressed as clowns interrupted a local Drag Queen Story Hour event in New Orleans.
[03:49:38.934 --> 03:49:43.256]  To draw attention to the absurdity of the situation, there you see the sign that they were holding.
[03:49:43.656 --> 03:49:44.977]  Drag Queen Story Hour.
[03:49:45.377 --> 03:49:46.997]  Adult entertainment for kids.
[03:49:47.098 --> 03:49:48.578]  Welcome to Clown World.
[03:49:49.298 --> 03:49:59.783]  So they've rolled it into the Clown World meme, which again is about taking the honk pill, which is basically about just embracing the nihilism of all this absurdity, of all this ludicrousness.
[03:50:01.235 --> 03:50:10.457]  Drag Queen Story Hour, which first surfaced in 2015, sees men dressed as women tour public libraries and schools across the United States and Canada reading books to children.
[03:50:10.517 --> 03:50:13.158]  It's so psychologically healthy for them.
[03:50:13.218 --> 03:50:15.338]  They're not terrified and confused at all.
[03:50:16.359 --> 03:50:28.222]  According to the group's website, the aim of the project is to capture the imagination at play of gender fluidity of childhood and give kids glamorous, positive, and unabashedly queer role models.
[03:50:29.202 --> 03:50:29.322]  No.
[03:50:30.003 --> 03:50:33.404]  You don't introduce gender fluidity to two-year-old toddlers.
[03:50:33.444 --> 03:50:34.545]  That's child abuse.
[03:50:34.605 --> 03:50:36.325]  Stay away from the damn kids.
[03:50:38.346 --> 03:50:47.230]  The backlash grew last month after it was revealed that a man who was charged with sexually assaulting a child was allowed to read to kids at a library in Houston.
[03:50:48.110 --> 03:50:55.773]  So now activists with the American Identity Movement decided to protest a drag queen story hour in New Orleans by dressing up as clowns and crashing the event.
[03:50:56.443 --> 03:51:01.146]  Looks like they got kicked out in a hurry, but they managed to make their point.
[03:51:02.567 --> 03:51:07.110]  There you can see the panic over clown world meme, which is the video I made a few weeks ago.
[03:51:07.130 --> 03:51:11.853]  If you want to understand the true nature of clown world and what it represents, go and watch that video right there.
[03:51:12.933 --> 03:51:24.601]  Meanwhile, Wisconsin mother of seven agrees to plead guilty to trying to plot ISIS terror attacks by instructing recruits on how to build bombs and poison reservoirs on hacked Facebook accounts.
[03:51:25.620 --> 03:51:29.643]  A Wisconsin mother of seven has agreed to plead guilty to trying to plan ISIS terror attacks.
[03:51:30.303 --> 03:51:36.467]  The 45-year-old agreed to plead guilty to one count of providing material to support terrorist group in exchange for another being dropped.
[03:51:37.587 --> 03:51:44.231]  She called herself a housewife on a visa application to the US and she plotted attacks such as poisoning a reservoir with riocin.
[03:51:45.112 --> 03:51:49.034]  She was arrested last year after trying to use social media to recruit other terrorists.
[03:51:50.195 --> 03:51:52.917]  Meanwhile, over in Brunei,
[03:51:53.607 --> 03:51:57.108]  Of course they passed a recent law which allows them to stone gay people to death.
[03:51:58.208 --> 03:52:03.910]  Now the government of Brunei, this is quite funny given that it's a dark subject, this is quite gallows humour.
[03:52:04.690 --> 03:52:15.493]  The government of Brunei basically sent an angry letter to the European Parliament and said that, why are you all complaining about us stoning adulterers and gay people to death?
[03:52:16.414 --> 03:52:17.254]  As well as thieves.
[03:52:18.624 --> 03:52:25.529]  Brunei basically said, this is part of our cultural diversity and you should tolerate it if you have tolerance of Islam.
[03:52:26.129 --> 03:52:27.670]  So checkmate progressives.
[03:52:28.330 --> 03:52:30.572]  All cultures are equal after all, right?
[03:52:31.232 --> 03:52:33.594]  We all buy that cultural relativist argument.
[03:52:33.614 --> 03:52:38.317]  Apart from evil Western culture which is capitalistic and avaricious and imperialist.
[03:52:38.337 --> 03:52:39.478]  Apart from that one.
[03:52:40.118 --> 03:52:42.259]  All the other cultures are just as good as each other.
[03:52:43.080 --> 03:52:44.401]  So basically Brunei
[03:52:45.347 --> 03:52:57.698]  The Islamic dictatorship is now making the same point in an angry letter to the European Parliament, asserting that cultural diversity and tolerance of Islam should allow it to stone gay people to death without criticism.
[03:52:58.058 --> 03:52:59.799]  And who are you to complain about it?
[03:53:00.020 --> 03:53:01.581]  You privileged white liberals!
[03:53:02.882 --> 03:53:07.486]  The Islamic country recently introduced new punishments for the offences of theft, robbery, adultery and sodomy.
[03:53:07.506 --> 03:53:10.629]  They include amputation, whipping and stoning to death.
[03:53:11.670 --> 03:53:13.031]  After widespread criticism,
[03:53:14.381 --> 03:53:17.843]  I know that nobody marched on any embassies of Brunei in the West.
[03:53:18.523 --> 03:53:25.387]  Certainly not in anywhere near the same numbers that people were out marching for the hysterical fairy tale which is man-made global warming in London.
[03:53:26.708 --> 03:53:41.236]  But AFTA's criticism the government of Brunei hit back by reasserting that Islam is a quote way of life for its people and that the new laws should be put into context by considering the quote diversity of the world we share.
[03:53:42.210 --> 03:53:45.751]  And who are you to judge their culture, bigot?
[03:53:46.971 --> 03:53:57.873]  The letter goes on to emphasise that diversities in cultural, traditional and religious values in the world means that there is no one standard that fits all and that this necessitates tolerance.
[03:53:59.434 --> 03:54:00.894]  And who could argue with that, right?
[03:54:01.654 --> 03:54:04.675]  That is the cultural relativism argument that leftists make.
[03:54:05.285 --> 03:54:18.672]  When they assert that there are no bad cultures in the world and we should tolerate all cultures and all legal systems in this case with Sharia law and maybe you are a bigot for opposing the stoning to death of gay people.
[03:54:19.072 --> 03:54:28.557]  That's basically the point that the government of Brunei made in this letter and it's the same one that leftists make on a regular basis so checkmate progressives.
[03:54:30.178 --> 03:54:34.880]  Meanwhile neighbours complain after Belgian woman hosts 100 illegal migrants in her garden
[03:54:35.934 --> 03:54:45.340]  A woman in the Belgian village of Spy is causing controversy among other residents by hosting 100 migrants in her garden while they attempt to illegally reach the UK.
[03:54:46.101 --> 03:54:48.022]  And this is a Breitbart story.
[03:54:48.122 --> 03:54:56.768]  There's actually a video where these 100 migrants have just basically spread around the entire village and people are absolutely infuriated.
[03:54:57.668 --> 03:55:09.197]  The woman named Ameline has hosted a number of migrants on her property for the better part of a year, but the number has grown to where there are now nearly 100 mostly African migrants camped in tents in the area.
[03:55:10.678 --> 03:55:12.159]  But you know, you've got to give her credit.
[03:55:12.960 --> 03:55:22.207]  We've seen all the videos out of Sweden and France where they go up to people on the street, leftists, and say, do you support allowing migrants into the country?
[03:55:22.247 --> 03:55:22.487]  Yes.
[03:55:23.263 --> 03:55:25.965]  Do you support allowing migrants into people's homes?
[03:55:26.385 --> 03:55:26.726]  Yes.
[03:55:27.386 --> 03:55:28.647]  Well, here's a migrant.
[03:55:28.747 --> 03:55:30.068]  Are you going to take them home tonight?
[03:55:30.128 --> 03:55:32.269]  Are you going to give them a meal and a bed?
[03:55:33.590 --> 03:55:34.651]  No, don't think so.
[03:55:36.092 --> 03:55:37.313]  There you see the one in France.
[03:55:38.374 --> 03:55:41.396]  There was another one in Sweden more recently, which was even better.
[03:55:42.239 --> 03:55:44.700]  But so you've got to give this Belgian woman some credit.
[03:55:44.760 --> 03:55:47.702]  You know, she's put her money where her mouth is.
[03:55:48.262 --> 03:55:52.624]  She's put her principles on the line and she's taken in migrants into her back garden.
[03:55:53.004 --> 03:55:54.585]  And now there's a hundred of them.
[03:55:55.185 --> 03:56:00.007]  The neighbours are saying that criminality has gone through the roof and the place smells.
[03:56:00.287 --> 03:56:01.528]  That's what they said, not me.
[03:56:02.028 --> 03:56:05.730]  But again, give her credit for putting her principles on the line.
[03:56:06.542 --> 03:56:12.426]  And if you want to vote for governments that allow this into your country in the first place, then how dare you complain about it?
[03:56:13.686 --> 03:56:16.068]  Suicide rate doubles in France among police.
[03:56:17.208 --> 03:56:18.229]  This is out of zero edge.
[03:56:19.189 --> 03:56:24.373]  The French police are now processing after 28 officers have committed suicide so far in 2019.
[03:56:24.793 --> 03:56:28.295]  This is double the amount recorded at the same time last year.
[03:56:30.106 --> 03:56:31.506]  The working conditions are difficult.
[03:56:31.546 --> 03:56:32.627]  The management is too hard.
[03:56:32.647 --> 03:56:35.047]  And of course, as we know, over the past, what is it?
[03:56:35.327 --> 03:56:36.207]  How many weeks now?
[03:56:36.908 --> 03:56:37.848]  It's months and months.
[03:56:37.908 --> 03:56:39.888]  It must be into the 20s in terms of weeks.
[03:56:40.388 --> 03:56:48.410]  We've had yellow vest protesters out on the streets of Paris and other major cities in France, clashing with police on a regular basis.
[03:56:49.650 --> 03:56:50.831]  They hate being ordered.
[03:56:51.271 --> 03:56:56.652]  I'm sure some of them hate being ordered to carry out the brutal measures that we've seen against the yellow vests, given the
[03:56:57.327 --> 03:57:01.312]  You know, that should be on the same side as them, really, when you consider the circumstances.
[03:57:02.032 --> 03:57:08.840]  Now, within the first quarter of 2019, double the amount of French police officers have committed suicide.
[03:57:08.860 --> 03:57:10.362]  That is absolutely tragic.
[03:57:10.682 --> 03:57:17.630]  But it shows how France is being ripped apart right now by their globalist saviour, Emmanuel Macron.
[03:57:18.547 --> 03:57:27.177]  Actress Emma Thompson generates 1.67 tons of CO2 on 5,400 mile flight to join climate protest.
[03:57:28.199 --> 03:57:33.405]  So she's flown 5,400 miles from Los Angeles to join the London Eco Warrior protest.
[03:57:33.425 --> 03:57:35.147]  There was a video interview where they asked her
[03:57:36.033 --> 03:57:40.417]  Are you going to start flying economy class to save carbon dioxide emissions?
[03:57:41.057 --> 03:57:42.538]  She said, God, no.
[03:57:42.558 --> 03:57:44.320]  Go and watch that video.
[03:57:44.360 --> 03:57:45.460]  It's absolutely hilarious.
[03:57:45.881 --> 03:57:47.262]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour.
[03:57:47.322 --> 03:57:49.203]  Coming up next is War Room with Owen Troyer.
[03:57:49.564 --> 03:57:51.986]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com and Summit.
[03:57:58.701 --> 03:58:01.482]  And let's go to Lucas in North Carolina.
[03:58:01.522 --> 03:58:02.322]  Thanks for holding your own here.
[03:58:02.603 --> 03:58:03.243]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:58:03.263 --> 03:58:03.803]  Good to be on.
[03:58:03.823 --> 03:58:04.543]  Good to have you here.
[03:58:04.803 --> 03:58:08.945]  Real quickly, I just wanted to say that I am a user of the Infowars products.
[03:58:09.225 --> 03:58:11.506]  First, I started with Supermail Vitality.
[03:58:11.526 --> 03:58:19.169]  I am a late-30s male, and I don't get all the time that I would like to work out as much as I do, and immediately noticed that
[03:58:19.469 --> 03:58:24.950]  Being able to retain strength and muscle mass from the use of super male vitality, so I want to thank you for that.
[03:58:25.090 --> 03:58:31.132]  Also, I bought the t-shirt, Reelect 45, and Hillary for Prison, obviously, one of the most popular.
[03:58:31.152 --> 03:58:36.233]  It's drawn so much attention, and I don't know if people believe it or not, but it's all positive attention.
[03:58:36.313 --> 03:58:42.695]  The main reaction that I got myself was from males 18 to 20 years old and middle-aged black women.
[03:58:43.135 --> 03:58:43.896]  We're good to go.
