[00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:21.927]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:22.387 --> 00:00:24.229]  Because there is a war on.
[00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:25.491]  Or your mind.
[00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:33.119]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:58.249]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... It's Alex Jones!
[00:00:58.269 --> 00:00:59.850]  Scum!
[00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.951]  Russian scum!
[00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:08.173]  Intel Wars comes to mind.
[00:01:12.295 --> 00:01:13.739]  Your reputation is amazing.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.524]  I will not let you down.
[00:01:15.544 --> 00:01:18.592]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:01:22.128 --> 00:01:25.070]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.416]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:01:33.837 --> 00:01:36.319]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:37.820]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.081]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:42.423]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[00:01:42.663 --> 00:01:43.724]  This is all confirmed.
[00:01:43.764 --> 00:01:44.705]  This is not a drill.
[00:01:44.865 --> 00:01:48.788]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:01:49.128 --> 00:01:50.449]  They've officially become state-run.
[00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:51.349]  Apple 100%.
[00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:57.170]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.371]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:03.531]  This is happening.
[00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:11.713]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[00:02:11.753 --> 00:02:17.494]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[00:02:17.914 --> 00:02:25.940]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.322]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[00:02:30.603 --> 00:02:33.805]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[00:02:34.065 --> 00:02:41.090]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.992]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[00:02:47.694 --> 00:02:54.521]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:20.598]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[00:03:20.638 --> 00:03:25.539]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:30.781]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:38.823]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[00:03:39.023 --> 00:03:46.085]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[00:03:46.165 --> 00:03:52.187]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and is being used against you.
[00:03:52.207 --> 00:03:56.808]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[00:03:56.828 --> 00:03:58.929]  I have given you the transmission!
[00:03:59.049 --> 00:03:59.929]  Now break free!
[00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:14.534]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:15.514]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:04:15.614 --> 00:04:19.896]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:04:25.188 --> 00:04:28.811]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Friday, February 8, 2019 broadcast.
[00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:34.856]  I am not going to be able to be on air right now because we're working on such a big, important story.
[00:04:35.597 --> 00:04:40.841]  I'm going to have to air some promos when we come back because I need to get our ducks in a row.
[00:04:41.442 --> 00:04:46.306]  Last night, we got blindsided by some of the raw footage being released by Sinclair.
[00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:48.628]  I can tell you where it all came from, how they got it.
[00:04:48.928 --> 00:04:51.631]  It was leaked by someone in the House or Senate.
[00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:54.962]  Judiciary Committee was not released by Roger Stone.
[00:04:55.383 --> 00:05:01.086]  We have all the raw footage, we've been authorized to release it, and it shows stunning criminal activity by the government.
[00:05:01.186 --> 00:05:06.170]  We'll show it to you.
[00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:21.320]  When we go off to war, when we exercise our rights, when we soar to our greatest heights, when we mourn and pray,
[00:05:24.284 --> 00:05:27.687]  When our neighbors are at risk.
[00:05:28.047 --> 00:05:29.969]  When our nation is threatened.
[00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.992]  There's someone to gather the facts.
[00:05:36.154 --> 00:05:37.155]  To bring you the story.
[00:05:39.817 --> 00:05:40.898]  No matter the cost.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.843]  This is why so many people can't stand the mainstream media.
[00:05:47.283 --> 00:05:49.025]  Because knowing empowers us.
[00:05:50.766 --> 00:05:52.608]  Knowing helps us decide.
[00:05:53.982 --> 00:05:58.166]  Knowing keeps us free.
[00:06:12.318 --> 00:06:17.282]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:45.166 --> 00:06:46.767]  It's Friday, February 8th, 2019.
[00:06:46.847 --> 00:06:51.790]  You get tomorrow's news today.
[00:06:52.831 --> 00:06:58.574]  Okay, I'm going to go to some recent reports we did and some important information.
[00:06:59.454 --> 00:07:05.538]  And then either next segment or next segment after that, not sure yet, I'll be back ready to premiere this information.
[00:07:06.538 --> 00:07:10.281]  But something that's important, I need to go over it one more time.
[00:07:11.304 --> 00:07:16.989]  And we're also going to blur the faces of the FBI agents, even though they wouldn't do that for us in the general public.
[00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.011]  And so we've got to deal with that.
[00:07:19.031 --> 00:07:20.873]  And we had a computer crash while it was doing it.
[00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:23.435]  So that's not the issue.
[00:07:23.955 --> 00:07:26.698]  We have the exclusive, complete FBI raid.
[00:07:27.298 --> 00:07:28.580]  They took the wrong DVR.
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.161]  They tried to cover the cameras up with tape.
[00:07:30.301 --> 00:07:31.222]  They were not successful.
[00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:37.868]  And Roger didn't even give us this footage to put on air.
[00:07:40.342 --> 00:07:51.352]  He gave it to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and he was told it was also then shared around to some other committees, and that his lawyers had them promise.
[00:07:52.591 --> 00:07:59.993]  Because obviously they reached out, seeing if they had any footage of the raid, that they would not leak it because the court's trying to gag Roger right now.
[00:08:00.773 --> 00:08:04.014]  And so he expressly had agreements through his lawyers that they would not leak it.
[00:08:04.074 --> 00:08:06.995]  Well, they leaked it to Sinclair, meaning it's probably Republicans.
[00:08:07.455 --> 00:08:08.655]  They probably thought they were helping Roger.
[00:08:09.736 --> 00:08:15.397]  So Roger overnighted to me last night via FedEx and UPS in case there was a problem.
[00:08:15.897 --> 00:08:18.018]  One arrived at 9 a.m., one arrived at 10 a.m.
[00:08:19.537 --> 00:08:29.685]  We went in and started reviewing the footage while I was here getting ready for the broadcast, and it's so horrible and also so dangerous.
[00:08:30.285 --> 00:08:33.487]  There'll definitely be payback for what we're going to do here, but you know what?
[00:08:33.607 --> 00:08:36.389]  Somebody's got to step up to this type of criminal activity.
[00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:42.254]  But the brazen, nakedness of this, this could take down the whole Mueller probe.
[00:08:43.786 --> 00:08:44.546]  Post-probe.
[00:08:45.187 --> 00:08:50.550]  Because it's dangerous, it's Byzantine, it's draconian, it's authoritarian, it's unconstitutional.
[00:08:51.671 --> 00:09:08.261]  How the FBI lied against the Mueller group, and how the Democrats lied, and how CNN lied, I know that's a big, big surprise, about CNN being tipped off to be there.
[00:09:09.221 --> 00:09:13.264]  Now, it's a felony to give out warrant information before it's served.
[00:09:14.397 --> 00:09:15.538]  Federal law, state law.
[00:09:16.578 --> 00:09:20.580]  It's also illegal on many other fronts, obviously.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:26.123]  You don't want propaganda productions in arrest situations.
[00:09:26.163 --> 00:09:27.204]  That's beyond police state.
[00:09:27.364 --> 00:09:29.145]  That's running man type stuff.
[00:09:31.684 --> 00:09:33.105]  I started talking to Roger this morning.
[00:09:33.505 --> 00:09:35.026]  He had some really bad family news.
[00:09:35.406 --> 00:09:36.707]  So he's been out of commission.
[00:09:36.747 --> 00:09:38.568]  I'm not at liberty to get into that, but it's really bad.
[00:09:38.948 --> 00:09:39.989]  So when it rains, it pours.
[00:09:40.049 --> 00:09:40.669]  Pray for Roger.
[00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:42.690]  About the worst type news you can get.
[00:09:43.911 --> 00:09:44.611]  I'm just leaving it at that.
[00:09:45.112 --> 00:09:45.772]  For some family.
[00:09:46.232 --> 00:09:47.553]  Separate from this whole fiasco.
[00:09:48.613 --> 00:09:54.897]  But by the time I talked to him this morning, he was telling me what was on the footage that I would get this morning.
[00:09:55.717 --> 00:09:57.278]  Because we flew out there the day after it happened.
[00:09:57.298 --> 00:09:58.059]  We wanted the footage.
[00:09:59.695 --> 00:10:01.335]  And they thought the FBI had taken everything.
[00:10:01.436 --> 00:10:03.356]  Well, then they're like, wait, this isn't a TV DVR.
[00:10:03.376 --> 00:10:04.336]  This is the camera footage.
[00:10:04.616 --> 00:10:06.597]  By the grace of God, they took the wrong stuff.
[00:10:08.117 --> 00:10:11.778]  And so then I was talking to Roger saying, hey, give us the footage, which he'd just given to his lawyers.
[00:10:13.558 --> 00:10:15.759]  And he goes, no, no, I don't want to get a gag put on me.
[00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:25.621]  He was busy in all the court cases and interviews, and his lawyers are like, Roger, what's on this hard drive is incredibly dangerous.
[00:10:27.216 --> 00:10:31.918]  And they'd already had some Republicans questioning Graham and others who'd reached out, seeing if there was any footage.
[00:10:32.318 --> 00:10:42.683]  So they contacted him, they talked to advisors in Congress that said the way to do it is not to mail it, but to upload the footage directly to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.
[00:10:43.003 --> 00:10:44.064]  And that was done under agreement.
[00:10:45.664 --> 00:10:46.385]  Then they leaked it!
[00:10:47.145 --> 00:10:48.926]  Right before he's gonna have his gagging hearing.
[00:10:49.266 --> 00:10:51.667]  Now, I don't know if they understand, that'll probably get him gagged now.
[00:10:51.987 --> 00:10:53.648]  They had to come out and tell the truth that he didn't do it.
[00:10:56.761 --> 00:10:59.964]  Everybody's focusing on the raid and then pointing a gun at his wife and all this stuff.
[00:11:00.265 --> 00:11:01.266]  That's not the news.
[00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:15.381]  We have the footage of the FBI like they are Steven Spielberg directing the whole thing.
[00:11:15.921 --> 00:11:18.024]  The camera guy telling him what to do, directing him.
[00:11:18.044 --> 00:11:19.125]  We can blow the footage up.
[00:11:20.211 --> 00:11:32.454]  And you've got the FBI standing around him, telling him what to do while he's setting up, and pointing at the house, and getting ready, and then they all pull back, stage the raid, talk to him again during it, then tell him, get out of here, so they can all pose and say, oh, we didn't know he was there.
[00:11:32.754 --> 00:11:33.535]  He's hiding in the bushes.
[00:11:35.235 --> 00:11:45.678]  I mean, premeditated criminal activity sent a chill up my spine, because by the grace of God, they didn't get the footage.
[00:11:47.315 --> 00:11:52.059]  And then all Roger's trying to do is stay out of prison, no Russiagate, no nothing, for his family.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:12:08.772]  I've got the globalists breathing down my neck, and... They're the type of crooks that would just take us, going, oh, here, FBI, have this, oh... They take that as weakness, probably put me in prison as a Russian agent.
[00:12:09.512 --> 00:12:14.216]  You're the agents of evil, you're the agents serving the globalists, you're the people out of control!
[00:12:15.407 --> 00:12:18.268]  Like, Strzok and all the rest of these damn people look like demons!
[00:12:19.388 --> 00:12:20.248]  You're frickin' nuts!
[00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:22.869]  You're out of control!
[00:12:23.949 --> 00:12:25.610]  And America has to stand up against you!
[00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.071]  And your whole fiasco!
[00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:30.351]  Why aren't you SWAT teaming Hillary Clinton?
[00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:32.912]  Why aren't you SWAT teaming George Soros?
[00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:34.432]  Real criminals!
[00:12:34.592 --> 00:12:40.694]  No, you're doing it to people that stood up for this country and kicked that witch's butt so she didn't get into office.
[00:12:42.235 --> 00:12:42.815]  See, I said I'd...
[00:12:44.144 --> 00:12:48.348]  Go to tape so I can get in here and review more of this and look at it because I'm not going to go off half-cocked with this.
[00:12:49.709 --> 00:12:51.090]  But this is why they want us off here.
[00:12:52.051 --> 00:12:53.392]  So they could pull all this crap.
[00:12:54.312 --> 00:12:59.777]  And so time and time again, it's InfoWars and our audience and our intel that defeats the globalist.
[00:13:00.978 --> 00:13:05.462]  Mike Adams got contacted by Apple Development yesterday for his big app.
[00:13:07.904 --> 00:13:12.868]  And they said, no shaitanism, no world government, no this, no that.
[00:13:15.404 --> 00:13:16.785]  No criticism of censorship.
[00:13:17.125 --> 00:13:22.489]  Now to get a news app approved, you have to sign an agreement that you won't talk about certain things.
[00:13:22.549 --> 00:13:25.631]  That's beyond Communist China.
[00:13:28.213 --> 00:13:29.694]  Let's move Roger to the bottom of the hour.
[00:13:31.575 --> 00:13:37.479]  Because we'll play these reports next segment and then I'm gonna get my ducks in a row.
[00:13:40.821 --> 00:13:42.722]  And we're going to air the
[00:13:44.710 --> 00:14:01.924]  Raw footage of all three clips of the FBI directing the CNN cameraman and then we're going to zoom it in so you can see it bigger than Dallas and you can see there we're already
[00:14:03.854 --> 00:14:08.238]  We're going to be posting these stills up as soon as they're ready to InfoWars.com.
[00:14:08.818 --> 00:14:14.263]  Global exclusive video shows the FBI directing CNN cameraman at Roger Stone Raid three times.
[00:14:14.583 --> 00:14:15.644]  We have the whole setup.
[00:14:17.906 --> 00:14:19.567]  Unbelievable.
[00:14:20.128 --> 00:14:28.095]  To then illegally do it, illegally let a news organization know about a federal raid and a federal warrant, place them
[00:14:29.571 --> 00:14:50.276]  Have them show up beforehand, then block the roads, go up and talk to him, set up his tripod, he gets out of the car as soon as they pull up, it's all rehearsed, they go back, they start the raid, they talk to him during that, he's right there in the middle of them, with the streets blocked, and then the bigger group of FBI comes over, good job, good job, you get out of here.
[00:14:51.397 --> 00:14:53.777]  He goes, gets in, leaves, Stone's brought out.
[00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:55.838]  And then they can put out their whole report.
[00:14:58.143 --> 00:15:01.907]  Now this is from Roger Stone's house.
[00:15:03.128 --> 00:15:04.189]  From his surveillance cameras.
[00:15:05.631 --> 00:15:07.172]  And they're going to do the same thing they always do.
[00:15:08.954 --> 00:15:15.180]  Just like the karate chop thing when Acosta's grabbing the mic back and pushing her arm down and they go, Oh Jones!
[00:15:15.761 --> 00:15:16.922]  He doctored the tape!
[00:15:17.222 --> 00:15:18.824]  Because we zoomed in so you could see what he did.
[00:15:18.844 --> 00:15:21.126]  We're putting the raw footage out.
[00:15:22.025 --> 00:15:24.307]  And then right after it, we're going to show it zoomed in.
[00:15:24.607 --> 00:15:25.608]  And anybody can zoom in.
[00:15:25.648 --> 00:15:26.169]  They're all footage.
[00:15:26.189 --> 00:15:27.170]  They're still going to change the subject.
[00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:27.930]  It's what they always do.
[00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:28.391]  It doesn't matter.
[00:15:28.691 --> 00:15:36.058]  America sees through this, just like the Covington kids, or just like the Democrats not standing for saying, let's not kill already born babies.
[00:15:36.338 --> 00:15:39.601]  These people are out of control because no one has reined them in.
[00:15:40.402 --> 00:15:41.483]  Like Thomas Jefferson said.
[00:15:43.348 --> 00:15:45.369]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:47.550]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:52.552]  I must execute my duty against this, and I'm proud of our crew, and I'm proud of Roger Stone.
[00:15:53.332 --> 00:15:54.393]  Victory or death!
[00:15:54.413 --> 00:15:55.874]  1776 worldwide!
[00:15:55.894 --> 00:15:55.974]  USA!
[00:15:55.994 --> 00:15:56.154]  USA!
[00:15:56.214 --> 00:15:56.634]  The real USA!
[00:15:56.694 --> 00:15:59.395]  I've been on air 24 years, and I set out to
[00:16:11.556 --> 00:16:18.737]  Awaken America and the world because I believed that humanity weren't cowards and the humanity wasn't stupid.
[00:16:19.177 --> 00:16:34.000]  That if folks were shown the facts of what was being constructed by the globalists, by the technocrats, and that their endgame is a anti-god, anti-human, satanic world system, I believed that good men and women would stand up and rally against it.
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.801]  And I don't take all the credit for what's happened with Infowars.
[00:16:36.841 --> 00:16:38.501]  In fact, I take very little of the credit.
[00:16:38.661 --> 00:16:53.762]  I believe there was a focal point laying it out with the evidence as only the internet coming into its own 24 years ago could allow up until that point in history that people would respond and that the population would start researching themselves and that it would trigger a chain reaction.
[00:16:54.043 --> 00:16:55.064]  I never intended though
[00:16:55.885 --> 00:16:58.986]  To be a hyper-dominant leader at the forefront of this.
[00:16:59.247 --> 00:17:05.349]  I was always about having other guests and other individuals and groups on who were experts in their field to help inform the public even better than I could.
[00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:13.873]  But in the last 10 years, InfoWars became the dominant leader, globally, in rebooting nationalism and renaissance against the globalist, post-industrial, neo-feudalist system.
[00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:21.357]  But the globalists ignored that, which was fine with me, until about three years ago, when they decided to use me against Trump and other nationalists.
[00:17:21.917 --> 00:17:25.639]  By misrepresenting who I was and what I really said, and taking me out of context.
[00:17:25.699 --> 00:17:34.142]  That miscalculation actually spread anti-New World Order information technology around the world faster, and was critical in putting Trump over the top.
[00:17:34.282 --> 00:17:51.290]  And then, they made the decision, because of all the chain reactions everywhere, where there were fan videos every day with 5, 10 million views apiece, and hundreds of millions of views a week on different platforms, not even of my own show, but of derivatives of what I was saying and doing, they hit the panic button and said, we were already looking at total censorship.
[00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:52.411]  In the next few years.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:18.043]  Have been brought into these cults of big tech who are allowed to have access to everything you do.
[00:18:18.063 --> 00:18:25.566]  It's in the news today that you have a brain tumor, that you're pregnant, that you're depressed, that you have HIV, that you're gay.
[00:18:25.866 --> 00:18:31.048]  Whatever it is, they're there raping your privacy while calling themselves liberal.
[00:18:31.228 --> 00:18:31.709]  They're a fraud.
[00:18:31.809 --> 00:18:34.610]  But the things they've done to this, the things they've pulled against InfoWars,
[00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:48.275]  If our audience doesn't realize how critical it is, and don't keep spreading the word, and don't keep sharing articles and videos, and don't keep buying the great products you already need anyways, The Globalist will be successful in the next year or so shutting down InfoWars.
[00:18:48.335 --> 00:18:50.016]  So, I'm shooting up the bat signal here.
[00:18:50.356 --> 00:18:59.900]  You've really supported us over the years, but the fight's now reaching the critical part of the battle, and I need your commitment to get great products you already need, but to steadfastly get them at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:19:02.847 --> 00:19:08.832]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[00:19:09.212 --> 00:19:11.814]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[00:19:12.434 --> 00:19:15.857]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[00:19:16.137 --> 00:19:20.401]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:19:20.841 --> 00:19:24.084]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[00:19:24.984 --> 00:19:35.212]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[00:19:35.973 --> 00:19:44.520]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[00:19:46.161 --> 00:19:54.706]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[00:19:59.508 --> 00:20:00.769]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:14.491 --> 00:20:14.995]  Oh, yeah.
[00:20:22.384 --> 00:20:32.506]  Certainly for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive.
[00:20:32.526 --> 00:20:46.709]  But if you can get through all that to explore what he's been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life-changing.
[00:20:48.018 --> 00:20:49.060]  He predicted 9-11.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:58.012]  And if there was an outside threat like a bin Laden, who was a known CIS in the 80s, he's the boogeyman they need in this Orwellian phony system.
[00:20:58.053 --> 00:21:01.958]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[00:21:08.863 --> 00:21:17.846]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalism.
[00:21:18.146 --> 00:21:22.688]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg Group et al.
[00:21:25.989 --> 00:21:31.571]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon Valley.
[00:21:34.092 --> 00:21:35.312]  They falsely edited him.
[00:21:37.833 --> 00:21:40.374]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[00:21:41.855 --> 00:21:46.137]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[00:21:47.937 --> 00:21:53.880]  And now he is being deplatformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:58.402]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[00:21:58.482 --> 00:22:00.863]  And then we get hit and say, you don't want to use our software.
[00:22:02.114 --> 00:22:04.955]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[00:22:05.475 --> 00:22:07.036]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[00:22:07.096 --> 00:22:07.916]  They just killed our stream.
[00:22:09.136 --> 00:22:09.416]  Really?
[00:22:09.596 --> 00:22:09.836]  Yep.
[00:22:09.977 --> 00:22:12.557]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[00:22:14.238 --> 00:22:15.178]  This is America in 2018.
[00:22:15.218 --> 00:22:23.781]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[00:22:26.031 --> 00:22:30.015]  Will you do nothing while history is being recorded?
[00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:32.217]  Will you sit and do nothing?
[00:22:32.237 --> 00:22:39.943]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[00:22:40.924 --> 00:22:45.849]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.923]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:23:14.843 --> 00:23:24.410]  Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country.
[00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:33.116]  America was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination, and control.
[00:23:33.757 --> 00:23:36.659]  We are born free, and we will stay free.
[00:23:38.061 --> 00:23:39.882]  We live in a republic.
[00:23:39.902 --> 00:23:50.931]  In simpler times, Plato described that as three major classes existing in an ideal state corresponding to the three parts of the soul, an equal balance of power.
[00:23:51.131 --> 00:23:58.176]  The philosophers governed the city, the soldiers defended it, and the producers grew food and created culture.
[00:23:58.456 --> 00:24:03.920]  Today, a republic is more commonly known as a state in which supreme power
[00:24:04.821 --> 00:24:08.003]  Again, three ideal classes equally balancing the power of the people.
[00:24:08.023 --> 00:24:11.145]  But what happens when one of those ideal classes, the philosophers or the representatives,
[00:24:28.777 --> 00:24:31.439]  Want all of that power for themselves.
[00:24:31.699 --> 00:24:33.861]  They will do anything to control it.
[00:24:34.101 --> 00:24:36.782]  And examples like the following ensue.
[00:24:37.083 --> 00:24:49.171]  Vanessa Tyson, a Scripps College professor in California, released a sorted account of an alleged 2004 sexual assault she endured from current Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax.
[00:24:49.471 --> 00:25:07.667]  Fairfax would assume the governor's seat if current Virginia Governor Ralph Northam steps down after dozens of Democrats have called for Northam's resignation due to his fumbling of his blackface debacle, which was really just a distraction from his comments supporting post-birth abortion.
[00:25:07.887 --> 00:25:10.988]  Lieutenant Governor Fairfax allegedly forced Ms.
[00:25:11.028 --> 00:25:13.609]  Tyson to perform a sex act on him.
[00:25:13.869 --> 00:25:15.729]  And it didn't happen back in high school.
[00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:16.469]  It happened in 2004.
[00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:20.251]  So where are these Democrats now?
[00:25:20.271 --> 00:25:21.751]  We believe Dr. Blasey Ford!
[00:25:22.071 --> 00:25:24.632]  And we believe women!
[00:25:25.032 --> 00:25:27.252]  We believe women!
[00:25:27.272 --> 00:25:32.394]  Dr. Ford, with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?
[00:25:33.687 --> 00:25:37.490]  100%.
[00:25:33.707 --> 00:25:37.490]  Guess who's perpetuating all of these kinds of actions?
[00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:42.634]  It's the men in this country, and I just want to say to the men in this country to shut up and step up.
[00:25:43.534 --> 00:25:44.215]  Do the right thing.
[00:25:44.655 --> 00:25:50.759]  I have found your testimony powerful and credible, and I believe you.
[00:25:50.919 --> 00:25:51.840]  So I want to thank you.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.222]  I want to thank you for your courage, and I want to tell you I believe you.
[00:25:55.205 --> 00:25:56.866]  Well, the question is, do we value women?
[00:25:57.066 --> 00:25:58.487]  And that's the fundamental question.
[00:25:58.528 --> 00:25:59.348]  Do we believe women?
[00:25:59.708 --> 00:26:04.972]  Do we give them an ability to tell their story, to be heard, to have some measure of accountability?
[00:26:04.992 --> 00:26:07.614]  And, you know, sometimes it's very hard.
[00:26:07.874 --> 00:26:10.837]  And you have to do what's right, even when it's hard, especially when it's hard.
[00:26:12.642 --> 00:26:18.730]  The sound of crickets is deafening when a Democrat is accused of sexual assault.
[00:26:18.791 --> 00:26:21.214]  And the Democrats' hypocrisy never ends.
[00:26:21.634 --> 00:26:29.185]  As Jamie White reported, Virginia's Attorney General admitted to wearing blackface at a 1980 college party when he was 19 years old.
[00:26:30.266 --> 00:26:34.587]  Marking the third high-ranking Democrat of the state to come under fire in a week.
[00:26:34.887 --> 00:26:40.729]  The irony is the fourth person in line if the dominoes fall in Virginia is a Republican.
[00:26:40.889 --> 00:26:45.091]  Meanwhile, the party of hate regurgitates its own insanity.
[00:26:45.311 --> 00:26:59.315]  We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution, and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.
[00:27:04.867 --> 00:27:11.111]  I saw this as a psychotically incoherent speech with cookies and dog poop.
[00:27:11.792 --> 00:27:19.116]  He tries to put together in the same speech these warm, kind things about humanitarianism and caring about children.
[00:27:19.396 --> 00:27:25.260]  At the same time, he is demonizing people who are immigrants in a way that was appalling.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.601]  Demonizing child trafficking?
[00:27:26.621 --> 00:27:27.322]  No, no, hold on a second.
[00:27:27.342 --> 00:27:27.762]  Hold on a second.
[00:27:28.262 --> 00:27:30.484]  There were people in that gallery.
[00:27:31.471 --> 00:27:35.494]  Who were children who had been torn away from their mothers at the border.
[00:27:36.055 --> 00:27:37.056]  He did not mention them.
[00:27:37.356 --> 00:27:41.900]  There were soldiers who were transgender, who had been thrown out of the military.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.601]  He didn't mention them.
[00:27:43.681 --> 00:27:46.484]  There are people who, there are veterans, he's talking about veterans!
[00:27:46.744 --> 00:27:50.425]  There are veterans who he has thrown out of this country who are dreamers.
[00:27:50.765 --> 00:27:51.886]  He did not mention them.
[00:27:52.206 --> 00:27:54.067]  And he didn't say one positive thing.
[00:27:54.447 --> 00:27:58.008]  Listen, if you want to talk about the people he could have mentioned... So he's not mentioning?
[00:27:58.208 --> 00:27:59.569]  Is it bad speech?
[00:27:59.649 --> 00:28:02.090]  Is he supposed to mention everybody you want him to mention?
[00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:08.972]  Seriously, the Democratic Party may require a psychiatric evaluation in the very near future.
[00:28:09.092 --> 00:28:14.314]  Decisions about America's future shouldn't be in the hands of sociopaths
[00:28:14.514 --> 00:28:22.300]  That have created a lopsided politicized system of justice that is a very real threat to the future of our Republic.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.781]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:28:26.723 --> 00:28:27.484]  It's fun.
[00:28:43.661 --> 00:28:49.705]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:28:50.105 --> 00:28:51.606]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:29:04.454 --> 00:29:06.475]  I don't believe the globalists are that smart.
[00:29:09.771 --> 00:29:21.198]  I don't believe you're that stupid that we have this information and that if they shut me down, it's shut down when these pieces of crap are executing this information in front of everybody.
[00:29:21.238 --> 00:29:26.761]  Do you know why there have been layoffs at more than 20 major leftist fake news publications?
[00:29:26.921 --> 00:29:29.223]  From BuzzFeed to Newsweek to Vice.
[00:29:29.423 --> 00:29:30.623]  Why did it all happen this week?
[00:29:30.704 --> 00:29:33.365]  Why did it happen a month ago or a month from now?
[00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:35.026]  Why wasn't it doled out?
[00:29:35.186 --> 00:29:37.307]  Because it's concerted.
[00:29:38.628 --> 00:29:43.732]  It's like a bombing run with a group of bombers flying in and they've all got targets.
[00:29:44.212 --> 00:29:46.233]  And they're all commanded by their HQ.
[00:29:46.253 --> 00:29:48.915]  And by the way, I don't just think that.
[00:29:49.215 --> 00:29:50.256]  I have their blueprint.
[00:29:50.456 --> 00:29:51.637]  I have their bombing run.
[00:29:51.737 --> 00:29:53.118]  I have their attack profile.
[00:29:53.378 --> 00:29:54.839]  I have their Achilles.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.542]  And I'm here telling you their Achilles.
[00:29:59.182 --> 00:30:01.083]  I'm here telling you how to defeat them.
[00:30:01.464 --> 00:30:03.185]  Real intelligence is observation.
[00:30:04.306 --> 00:30:05.887]  Real intelligence is infiltration.
[00:30:06.883 --> 00:30:11.910]  Real intelligence is interfacing banging heads with your enemy.
[00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:19.460]  Because you begin to know your enemy better than the enemy knows you.
[00:30:19.921 --> 00:30:21.783]  All real warfare that
[00:30:21.783 --> 00:30:23.525]  What's victorious is psychic.
[00:30:23.685 --> 00:30:29.811]  It can be physical, but that's only to draw out the essence of the enemy's goals and their fears.
[00:30:30.091 --> 00:30:34.315]  And then the commitment to meet your enemy with your goals and your love.
[00:30:34.636 --> 00:30:35.617]  Love trumps all.
[00:30:35.677 --> 00:30:40.301]  But you have to realistically have the template of victory to be able to take it on.
[00:30:41.042 --> 00:30:53.612]  You can't counter a civilizational ending event, a planned viral demolition of humanity, a Earth-ending termination of the birth of a new species, a new vision, a new world.
[00:30:53.832 --> 00:30:57.495]  You can't counter something like that with lack of vision.
[00:30:57.635 --> 00:30:59.297]  Simply countering their program.
[00:30:59.377 --> 00:31:07.303]  You must offer the world that you see and see if others believe in that world and see how they will then offer information to that world.
[00:31:07.443 --> 00:31:08.864]  To build a new, better world.
[00:31:09.124 --> 00:31:10.704]  You have to recruit in a war.
[00:31:10.924 --> 00:31:15.706]  And to do that, you need to look for people that aren't just trying to be in charge of something.
[00:31:15.746 --> 00:31:18.867]  You need to look for people that want to be involved in something.
[00:31:19.007 --> 00:31:20.968]  Involved in something bigger than them.
[00:31:21.048 --> 00:31:23.809]  Not because they want to rule people, but because they love people.
[00:31:23.889 --> 00:31:30.691]  Because they love their ancestors, and they love humanity, and they have a vision that they want to add to in the future.
[00:31:32.191 --> 00:31:37.093]  So that all the victories and the successes of our progeny, when we're the ancestors,
[00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:40.651]  I think?
[00:31:57.753 --> 00:32:03.035]  Because they've bet on this planet, and they've bet on their takeover, and they think they're victorious.
[00:32:03.095 --> 00:32:09.137]  And that's why I hate to plug products and the things we sell, but everything we sell is good.
[00:32:09.677 --> 00:32:12.038]  It's the best there is at the price it's at.
[00:32:12.798 --> 00:32:21.101]  And it funds what we're doing that's so fundamentally radical against the spirit of this world that it shakes the enemies of humanity to their very core.
[00:32:21.641 --> 00:32:23.842]  And that's why I know we're going to win in the end.
[00:32:23.942 --> 00:32:48.738]  But I want to ask you to commit by word of mouth and by prayer, in the public realm and in personal soul, but also in the physical, the energy you expend every day in the system, to transfer part of that to us, to know that there is a full commitment to push our will against the enemy with everything we've got, and to lean in when their knives are stabbing into our guts, to lean into their hate, and just lean in and take it.
[00:32:49.498 --> 00:32:49.958]  I'm ready.
[00:32:50.638 --> 00:32:51.899]  And I'll lean in and I'll take it.
[00:32:52.179 --> 00:32:58.100]  But I need your backing so that when I swing my sword, it'll absolutely devastate the enemy.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.301]  When I raise my shield, it's your will that empowers it.
[00:33:07.082 --> 00:33:09.683]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.188 --> 00:33:25.849]  Big Brother.
[00:33:26.329 --> 00:33:27.549]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:28.109 --> 00:33:29.250]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:31.471]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:31.711 --> 00:33:32.871]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:33.371 --> 00:33:38.073]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:48.727 --> 00:34:15.939]  It is Friday, February 8th, 2019, and you are about to see and hear undoubtedly what is going to go down in history as one of the most incredible cases of the corporate mainstream media, the out-of-control Robert Mueller witch hunt Inquisition, and the Democratic Party all working in concert
[00:34:17.048 --> 00:34:31.603]  To lie to the people and to violate federal law so they can set someone up and send them to prison as the cherry on top of the completely failed, fraudulent Russiagate investigation now supposedly winding down.
[00:34:31.924 --> 00:34:32.745]  But they're not really doing that.
[00:34:32.765 --> 00:34:37.289]  They're about to just pass it on to Congress and expand the out-of-control witch hunt from there.
[00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:39.191]  We have the announcement that the
[00:34:40.612 --> 00:34:56.719]  House Judiciary Committee, headed up by Schiff, is hiring former Trump administration securities experts, people in the National Security Group, to then come into the committee and run the operation against the President.
[00:34:56.739 --> 00:35:01.981]  A total violation of the separation of powers from the National Security Council.
[00:35:02.041 --> 00:35:03.001]  Completely illegal.
[00:35:03.221 --> 00:35:05.322]  Never before seen in U.S.
[00:35:05.362 --> 00:35:05.682]  history.
[00:35:06.062 --> 00:35:07.343]  So that is all coming up.
[00:35:08.043 --> 00:35:09.204]  There's so many facets
[00:35:10.097 --> 00:35:11.158]  To what you're about to witness.
[00:35:11.178 --> 00:35:13.700]  We're just going to talk about it in this segment.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:23.688]  And the footage, we're adding a StoneDefenseFund.com bug to it, an Infowars.com bug to it, and blurring out the faces of the FBI agents.
[00:35:23.728 --> 00:35:24.749]  That's almost done.
[00:35:25.249 --> 00:35:27.731]  We had a computer crash earlier before the show, so we had to redo it.
[00:35:28.852 --> 00:35:29.913]  That's just the way things work.
[00:35:30.013 --> 00:35:33.696]  But we're going to explain why you're about to see this footage and why it's so important.
[00:35:36.038 --> 00:35:45.726]  This is incredible, because it's a felony, federal and state, to release an arrest warrant earlier.
[00:35:45.846 --> 00:35:48.688]  But Stone's gotten the documents that CNN got the day before.
[00:35:48.928 --> 00:35:50.009]  They messed up and admitted it.
[00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:51.831]  These people are very incompetent.
[00:35:52.751 --> 00:35:56.454]  Then, everybody obviously knew, why was there a CNN reporter out there?
[00:35:56.474 --> 00:36:00.317]  He said, oh, he just happened to show up randomly and the FBI didn't see him.
[00:36:00.878 --> 00:36:03.720]  No, he pulls in 30 minutes before, he parks there,
[00:36:05.259 --> 00:36:11.501]  They come in, they direct him, they shut the streets off, they direct him again, and at the end, right before Stone's brought out, they tell him, now leave.
[00:36:12.481 --> 00:36:14.121]  The whole thing's directed by the FBI.
[00:36:14.842 --> 00:36:17.362]  You've seen the FBI's footage shot by CNN.
[00:36:17.802 --> 00:36:23.044]  You've seen the Sinclair footage, a little bit of it leaked by somebody in Congress who had it, we're not sure yet.
[00:36:23.984 --> 00:36:31.166]  This is new footage, exclusive from Roger Stone's security cameras, that the FBI thought they took the hard drive for.
[00:36:32.008 --> 00:36:33.669]  You'll see them cover up the cameras with tape.
[00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:38.474]  You'll see them do all this because they didn't get the footage by the grace of God.
[00:36:38.814 --> 00:36:41.356]  And by the grace of God, we have fake news kingpins.
[00:36:42.597 --> 00:36:47.861]  CNN involved in felony actions bigger than Dallas.
[00:36:49.383 --> 00:36:54.907]  And this is all going to premiere for you next segment.
[00:36:56.869 --> 00:36:57.710]  But ladies and gentlemen,
[00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:17.384]  This is unbelievable what you're about to see, because it is incontrovertible that the FBI lied, that they released the warrant early, that they didn't think Stone was dangerous, it was all for show, that they let CNN in, blocked the streets, directed CNN three times.
[00:37:18.124 --> 00:37:22.186]  You'll see FBI agents coming up, looks like they're patting him on the back, and then saying, get out of here.
[00:37:23.311 --> 00:37:26.213]  Right before they bring Stone out so they can all deny they ever saw each other.
[00:37:26.633 --> 00:37:28.535]  This is villainy.
[00:37:29.215 --> 00:37:31.416]  And it's caught red-handed.
[00:37:32.157 --> 00:37:35.439]  Like when somebody on those court TV shows goes, I didn't break into that house.
[00:37:35.479 --> 00:37:35.979]  They go, oh really?
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.300]  Here's the footage of you doing it.
[00:37:39.022 --> 00:37:40.503]  Or I didn't cheat on my husband.
[00:37:40.523 --> 00:37:42.084]  And then there's surveillance footage of it.
[00:37:42.384 --> 00:37:45.466]  This is open and shut bombshell.
[00:37:45.906 --> 00:37:50.709]  And it shows how fraudulent and how out of control and how political all this was.
[00:37:50.749 --> 00:37:52.631]  So let's take you now to his home.
[00:37:53.672 --> 00:37:57.316]  To Roger Stone, to give his perspective and take on this.
[00:37:57.336 --> 00:38:07.568]  We'll have to go into the next hour, we're moving Gerald Cilente back, he understands, because then we're going to show you him being walked out in his bare feet, his wife being shoved, people pointing guns at him.
[00:38:07.869 --> 00:38:10.052]  This is all the footage they thought you wouldn't see.
[00:38:11.092 --> 00:38:19.716]  And man, if you look at the faces on these people, we're blurring them out just for, okay, okay, so you're not going to be on narcotics raids and you don't want to be endangered or whatever, but you know what?
[00:38:19.736 --> 00:38:28.659]  You endangered Roger Stone and his wife and his family and everybody else being part of this fraud, so shame on you, but we're going to be better men than you, and we're going to blur your faces out.
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:33.421]  But I mean, it's not even as much the SWAT team guys that are acting like they're Cheshire Cats.
[00:38:33.921 --> 00:38:37.663]  When the FBI agent, you know, regular ones show up, it's like they are.
[00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:40.512]  Happier than pigs, and you know what?
[00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:42.694]  It's shocking footage.
[00:38:43.656 --> 00:38:47.120]  Shocking, shocking, shocking, and very demoralizing.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.843]  But you know the good news is, Congress is going to get a hold of this now.
[00:38:50.805 --> 00:38:53.568]  And they're not going to be able to hide this information.
[00:38:53.808 --> 00:38:55.190]  So Roger Stone, so much to cover.
[00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:56.652]  Thank you for joining us, my friend.
[00:38:57.967 --> 00:38:58.787]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:39:00.128 --> 00:39:23.662]  So essentially, at exactly five o'clock, as I was beginning my war room broadcast with Owen Schroer, I learned that Sinclair Media had obtained at least some of the home surveillance camera, home security camera footage that my lawyers have sent to the Senate and House Judiciary Committee members.
[00:39:25.032 --> 00:39:31.358]  And since that time, the media onslaught outside my house has ramped back up.
[00:39:31.418 --> 00:39:37.324]  Right now there are cameras and crews from all of the networks camped outside.
[00:39:38.225 --> 00:39:46.574]  ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, Fox have all asked for copies of what people are about to see.
[00:39:47.461 --> 00:39:57.003]  But I sent it to you because we know how the mainstream media edits and they clips and they cleanse and they don't show people the truth.
[00:39:58.683 --> 00:40:07.125]  Let me say from the outset that once I was taken into custody, the FBI agents treated me with complete courtesy and professionalism.
[00:40:07.765 --> 00:40:15.727]  And even during the raid, many of them looked at me and rolled their eyes as if to say, look, I'm here because I've been ordered to be here.
[00:40:15.787 --> 00:40:16.387]  But this is
[00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.771]  Nonsense.
[00:40:18.994 --> 00:40:23.322]  But I guess the real point here is that this whole thing was unnecessary.
[00:40:24.036 --> 00:40:27.979]  The special counsel knew that I was represented by lawyers.
[00:40:28.719 --> 00:40:31.041]  They know that I don't have a valid passport.
[00:40:31.601 --> 00:40:36.384]  They know that you can't in Florida have both a medicinal marijuana card and a firearm.
[00:40:36.404 --> 00:40:37.305]  It's against the law.
[00:40:37.745 --> 00:40:45.710]  Therefore, although I strongly support the Second Amendment, I have glaucoma in my right eye from a boxing injury and a detached retina.
[00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:50.013]  And the medicinal marijuana helps me, although I haven't used it in quite some time.
[00:40:51.297 --> 00:40:53.938]  And they know that I'm not a flight risk.
[00:40:54.758 --> 00:41:02.420]  That's proven by the fact that the magistrate only hours later released me on bond, essentially on my own signature, a surety bond.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.361]  The government did not oppose that.
[00:41:04.821 --> 00:41:12.383]  Exactly, Roger, but I think it's important that we get into, you didn't leak this footage, somebody in the House or Senate Judiciary Committee did.
[00:41:12.743 --> 00:41:14.503]  We need to go over the background of that.
[00:41:14.523 --> 00:41:15.663]  They're trying to gag you tomorrow.
[00:41:16.044 --> 00:41:17.444]  And then the big enchilada
[00:41:18.144 --> 00:41:19.044]  CNN lied.
[00:41:19.485 --> 00:41:20.825]  The FBI higher-ups lied.
[00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:21.765]  The Justice Department lied.
[00:41:22.046 --> 00:41:23.326]  Said that CNN wasn't tipped off.
[00:41:23.766 --> 00:41:25.027]  You've actually gotten the warrant.
[00:41:25.067 --> 00:41:26.027]  CNN was sent early.
[00:41:26.047 --> 00:41:27.888]  You have all the proof.
[00:41:27.908 --> 00:41:30.609]  And now we have the footage of the whole thing being directed.
[00:41:30.629 --> 00:41:33.190]  It looks like Steven Spielberg is out there.
[00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:38.512]  The FBI is directing the CNN camera person, the tripod, everything.
[00:41:39.434 --> 00:41:40.474]  That's exactly right.
[00:41:40.614 --> 00:41:42.855]  So here's what we know definitively.
[00:41:43.516 --> 00:41:51.839]  First of all, my attorney learned that I had been arrested from a CNN reporter, not from the government, not from the special counsel.
[00:41:51.899 --> 00:41:56.461]  He was informed that I had been taken into custody by a CNN reporter.
[00:41:56.961 --> 00:42:14.669]  That reporter sent him a copy of my indictment, which was not the official release on Pacer that was put out by the government after I had been taken into custody, but was an earlier draft with metadata that proved it was created the day before.
[00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:19.271]  And written by Andrew Weissman, the pitbull for Robert Mueller.
[00:42:19.792 --> 00:42:21.653]  CNN, of course, denies everything.
[00:42:22.033 --> 00:42:30.598]  But what we now know from this video, Alex, is that the CNN camera crew showed up roughly 50 minutes before the FBI did.
[00:42:31.338 --> 00:42:42.365]  And they set up their tripod, which you can clearly see, and their camera, roughly 25 feet from my front door, exactly nine minutes before the FBI even arrived.
[00:42:42.925 --> 00:42:48.869]  So, the idea that they're operating on a hunch, and this was just a stakeout, that's a lie.
[00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:56.535]  Now, today, CNN says, wow, we've been staking Stone's house out every Thursday for months.
[00:42:56.875 --> 00:42:57.435]  Yeah, right.
[00:42:57.616 --> 00:42:59.437]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:59.477 --> 00:42:59.777]  You're right.
[00:42:59.817 --> 00:43:00.558]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:00.578 --> 00:43:01.138]  Stay with us.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.841]  It took us over a year to develop it.
[00:43:05.581 --> 00:43:07.563]  Thousands and thousands of five-star reviews.
[00:43:08.672 --> 00:43:09.673]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[00:43:09.953 --> 00:43:14.997]  I'm so proud of you and the InfoWars team for all that you do.
[00:43:15.097 --> 00:43:16.739]  I wanted to say I love your product.
[00:43:16.959 --> 00:43:19.321]  The Brain Force Plus is amazing.
[00:43:20.022 --> 00:43:24.545]  Me and my family take it every day and I mean you really can feel what it does.
[00:43:24.565 --> 00:43:32.812]  We were able to develop Brain Force because we went out and looked at what the best-selling nootropics or brain focus energy products were.
[00:43:33.473 --> 00:43:35.254]  And we decided to make it even stronger
[00:43:36.235 --> 00:43:40.017]  And even more high quality and even more organic than leading competitors.
[00:43:40.577 --> 00:43:42.438]  And we've done it with Brain Force Plus.
[00:43:42.518 --> 00:43:46.640]  It is our number one bestseller in gross bottles sold.
[00:43:47.561 --> 00:43:51.923]  Now I made the decision in our marketing to put a lot of product in it and sell it for a low price.
[00:43:52.563 --> 00:43:59.966]  Believing that you're smart, you'll research the market, get a great result, know you're getting a great deal, and be routine, continued customers.
[00:44:00.366 --> 00:44:03.908]  I want a long-term relationship with you, and I want a product that I'm proud of, that I'm going to use.
[00:44:04.348 --> 00:44:05.568]  It's up there as the very best.
[00:44:05.889 --> 00:44:10.010]  There are nootropics that are $80 a bottle that aren't as good, that have some dissimilar ingredients.
[00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:13.612]  But, you know, a doctor sells it at their office, so it must be better.
[00:44:14.792 --> 00:44:21.375]  Ladies and gentlemen, we then stood back and said, what is the number one best-selling thing in the total market globally?
[00:44:22.381 --> 00:44:22.561]  I don't
[00:44:42.834 --> 00:44:48.898]  Top people in the country who has developed some of the other top energy drinks in the nation and in the world.
[00:44:49.318 --> 00:44:53.081]  And they developed TurboForce that is the next level.
[00:44:53.621 --> 00:44:54.562]  Long burn.
[00:44:54.582 --> 00:44:56.783]  A lot of folks up to 10 hours of energy.
[00:44:56.843 --> 00:44:57.884]  Me, 6, 7, 8 hours.
[00:44:58.264 --> 00:44:59.265]  And I take about a half a packet.
[00:44:59.285 --> 00:44:59.805]  It's so strong.
[00:45:00.145 --> 00:45:05.729]  And then it's got all the minerals and all the different amino acids that help deliver the energy into the body.
[00:45:06.482 --> 00:45:20.307]  And that's why I want to thank all the listeners who've been BrainForce fans with 50% off BrainForce, because the two go together to supply yourself and your family with your nootropic with TurboForce, ladies and gentlemen, so you can try it.
[00:45:20.707 --> 00:45:27.530]  It's 33% off, and you get it in a combo, 50% off on BrainForce for a limited time at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:30.591]  One is a pill, one is a packet.
[00:45:31.091 --> 00:45:35.413]  And again, the first time you take TurboForce, I recommend you only take half a packet, because let me tell you,
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:39.843]  Folks I know that are totally into energy drinks said they've never seen anything like it.
[00:45:40.224 --> 00:45:41.765]  Most energy drinks hit in 20-30 minutes.
[00:45:42.325 --> 00:45:45.889]  A lot of people get hit in 5 minutes with turbo force.
[00:45:46.369 --> 00:45:51.294]  But again, it doesn't just hit fast, it lasts super, super long because the developers
[00:45:52.403 --> 00:46:00.187]  That we reached out to had the mission of having something that gives you continual clean energy over a long period of time.
[00:46:00.527 --> 00:46:05.729]  So the different compounds that are in this, that synergistically work together, have different burn rates.
[00:46:06.289 --> 00:46:09.651]  Almost like a Saturn rocket's got three different components.
[00:46:11.172 --> 00:46:11.613]  See what I mean?
[00:46:11.893 --> 00:46:19.825]  It launches, you get the main boost phase, then you get up into orbit, get your next phase, get to the moon, land on the moon, come back to the Earth.
[00:46:20.206 --> 00:46:24.012]  You've got all those different phases here, ladies and gentlemen, to get you throughout the day.
[00:46:24.432 --> 00:46:25.273]  Boost in the morning!
[00:46:26.209 --> 00:46:31.410]  Continue on through your interstellar day, conquering, exploring, dominating.
[00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:34.271]  And listen, I like to ride my horse and shoot my gun.
[00:46:34.391 --> 00:46:37.272]  You know, a country boy's work is really never done.
[00:46:37.692 --> 00:46:44.913]  And after you put the kids down to bed with the missus there in your arms, you can do a repair job and fix the cable like all good Americans do.
[00:46:45.433 --> 00:46:46.434]  And all thanks to TurboForce.
[00:46:47.134 --> 00:46:51.715]  So again, coming to you, ladies and gentlemen, from the founding system,
[00:46:52.515 --> 00:46:56.757]  Of turbo force and brain force, I bring you this incredible product, the InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:46:56.977 --> 00:46:58.478]  Get the energy combo today.
[00:46:58.758 --> 00:47:00.299]  Oh, and fund the InfoWar and change the world.
[00:47:00.499 --> 00:47:01.340]  I forgot about that part too.
[00:47:06.502 --> 00:47:09.143]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:19.482 --> 00:47:20.504]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:20.604 --> 00:47:22.708]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:39.042 --> 00:47:43.144]  They've been working around the clock to kick us off every media platform they can.
[00:47:43.644 --> 00:47:46.825]  When our app went to number one in news on Apple, it was banned.
[00:47:47.485 --> 00:47:50.086]  Not because we lie, but because we tell the truth and we're bold.
[00:47:50.967 --> 00:47:54.728]  We have courage and we've changed the world thanks to you, the audience this broadcast.
[00:47:54.768 --> 00:48:07.313]  Now, coming up in a few minutes, we're going to air for TV viewers, radio listeners, I'll describe it, raw surveillance footage out of Roger Stone's house that no one has seen.
[00:48:08.288 --> 00:48:12.989]  Now again, if you just tuned in, you're like, wait, we all just saw this in clear footage yesterday of the raid from his perspective.
[00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:13.950]  No.
[00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:19.071]  He gave that to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees a week ago.
[00:48:20.732 --> 00:48:21.692]  Someone there leaked it.
[00:48:21.752 --> 00:48:22.772]  That's a whole nother story.
[00:48:23.332 --> 00:48:24.613]  That's only 30 seconds.
[00:48:25.633 --> 00:48:28.734]  We have the entire thing, all of it.
[00:48:29.714 --> 00:48:31.415]  The FBI thought they took the hard drive.
[00:48:31.455 --> 00:48:32.355]  They thought they took the DVR.
[00:48:32.395 --> 00:48:32.735]  They didn't.
[00:48:33.746 --> 00:48:34.526]  We have all the footage.
[00:48:35.347 --> 00:48:45.610]  We have them out on the street, and you can zoom in the HD video right there, with the FBI directing the cameraman, telling him what to do, everything, which is obvious.
[00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:56.814]  And metadata was received by a CNN reporter that didn't know what they were doing, sending Stone emails saying, hey, respond to your indictment.
[00:48:59.474 --> 00:49:00.775]  And it shows the timestamp
[00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:04.112]  A day before they SWAT teamed him.
[00:49:05.473 --> 00:49:08.556]  So, before anyone knew this happened, CNN knew.
[00:49:09.096 --> 00:49:09.817]  This is incredible.
[00:49:09.877 --> 00:49:12.419]  So, this shows the organized fraud.
[00:49:12.919 --> 00:49:13.700]  Criminal level.
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:18.804]  Just like Rosenstein and all these people like Comey.
[00:49:19.679 --> 00:49:20.220]  And McCabe.
[00:49:20.941 --> 00:49:25.947]  Hell, there's grand juries out looking to indict those guys right now in Maryland and Virginia.
[00:49:26.507 --> 00:49:29.871]  That's not getting coverage, though, because they lied to Congress.
[00:49:30.372 --> 00:49:32.074]  The FBI is not its own branch of government.
[00:49:32.094 --> 00:49:35.198]  It's not the Praetorian Guard in the fall of Rome.
[00:49:37.136 --> 00:49:38.917]  And so, it's rogue.
[00:49:38.937 --> 00:49:39.917]  And it's not the whole FBI.
[00:49:40.038 --> 00:49:41.958]  And I don't just say that because, oh, don't get me, FBI.
[00:49:42.119 --> 00:49:44.020]  I know a lot of FBI agents.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.600]  They're hard-working, good Christian people, on average.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:49.762]  But that's the low-level FBI agent that shows up if your kid gets kidnapped, there's a bank robbery.
[00:49:50.383 --> 00:49:52.524]  Or, you know, the local Muslim group's planning to bomb somebody.
[00:49:53.564 --> 00:49:57.386]  We're talking about the political, out-of-control, witch-hunt group at the top.
[00:49:58.007 --> 00:50:00.308]  But they're powerful, and they're in command of the FBI.
[00:50:02.073 --> 00:50:04.796]  So it doesn't matter if some of the agents said this is a bunch of crap and rolled their eyes.
[00:50:04.916 --> 00:50:05.657]  Obviously they know that.
[00:50:06.077 --> 00:50:07.879]  The point is to still follow orders, bro.
[00:50:07.919 --> 00:50:08.440]  Don't cut it.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.782]  And that's the point we've gotten to in this country.
[00:50:10.802 --> 00:50:13.565]  So, Roger, we're going to start getting to this footage.
[00:50:14.471 --> 00:50:21.376]  And I'm not even trying to build this up, but literally they're shutting down all our Facebooks, all our Twitters, fan pages, everything.
[00:50:21.476 --> 00:50:23.557]  It's happened to you so that we can't get out to people.
[00:50:23.577 --> 00:50:25.939]  So before we air this footage, we'll do the whole next hour on this.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.022]  Firing up the bat signal, Drudge has been very smart and cares about real news.
[00:50:30.602 --> 00:50:35.165]  When you gave your world exclusive before the press conference and your second press conference, he carried it.
[00:50:35.306 --> 00:50:36.086]  And those were important.
[00:50:36.526 --> 00:50:37.887]  Those dwarf.
[00:50:38.748 --> 00:50:41.170]  I mean, this is 50 times, in my view, more important
[00:50:42.259 --> 00:50:53.684]  This is the raw footage, and then zoomed in, of the FBI conferring, not once, not twice, but three times, with a reporter who's set up right at the front of your driveway.
[00:50:54.964 --> 00:50:58.926]  They block the streets, they come in, they direct him, they come back in, we're gonna show it all, then we're gonna show...
[00:51:00.356 --> 00:51:02.097]  The shocking footage of you and your wife.
[00:51:02.117 --> 00:51:03.718]  I mean, it's shocking.
[00:51:03.998 --> 00:51:10.863]  And I wish I could show their faces because, you know, the paramilitary guys are all serious, but then the regular FBI agents look like Yogi Bear or something.
[00:51:10.903 --> 00:51:12.944]  It's like they're at a picnic or something.
[00:51:13.745 --> 00:51:18.008]  And they're all slapping each other on the back, and they're setting up their tent.
[00:51:18.588 --> 00:51:23.291]  And I mean, it's just riveting, riveting behind-the-scenes footage.
[00:51:23.311 --> 00:51:27.934]  And you're seeing exclusive screenshots right now from InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:51:27.954 --> 00:51:28.895]  But I'm going to stop here.
[00:51:30.179 --> 00:51:31.240]  Because the hour is almost over.
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:33.961]  And we haven't talked about StoneDefenseFund.com.
[00:51:34.801 --> 00:51:36.002]  And believe me, I know about lawyers.
[00:51:36.122 --> 00:51:40.064]  Our lawyer bills... I don't want to tell the enemy what the lawyer bills were in the last 12 months.
[00:51:40.124 --> 00:51:41.064]  It'll make them very happy.
[00:51:41.484 --> 00:51:42.545]  But we've had some big successes.
[00:51:42.585 --> 00:51:43.465]  Just got text messages.
[00:51:43.906 --> 00:51:45.386]  We've just won two big things in court.
[00:51:45.426 --> 00:51:46.487]  You'll never see them out on the news.
[00:51:47.407 --> 00:51:48.868]  Problem is, I've won like 15 of these suits.
[00:51:48.888 --> 00:51:49.969]  They just filed five more.
[00:51:50.149 --> 00:51:50.989]  But we're winning those.
[00:51:51.049 --> 00:51:52.950]  But I'm in a knockdown dragout.
[00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:54.251]  And folks, I've got the crew.
[00:51:54.351 --> 00:51:55.491]  I've got the will.
[00:51:55.992 --> 00:51:57.512]  I've got the people to keep the fight going.
[00:51:57.532 --> 00:51:58.493]  But I'm telling you.
[00:51:59.213 --> 00:52:03.136]  You've got to tell everyone to tune in to InfoWars.com forward slash show right now.
[00:52:03.657 --> 00:52:07.640]  You've got to, when these videos go up, so people can see what happened to Roger.
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:10.683]  If they won't let us put it on YouTube or anywhere else, even though it's super newsworthy.
[00:52:11.384 --> 00:52:12.845]  Because, you know, we're the fake news people, they say.
[00:52:12.865 --> 00:52:13.986]  No, we're the real news people.
[00:52:14.947 --> 00:52:16.488]  Folks always say, wouldn't somebody stand up?
[00:52:16.548 --> 00:52:17.269]  Why don't they exist?
[00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:21.812]  We're going to upload all this to InfoWars.com in the next 30 minutes.
[00:52:21.832 --> 00:52:22.913]  We're going to stream it live.
[00:52:23.834 --> 00:52:24.675]  Coming up next segment.
[00:52:26.827 --> 00:52:28.028]  Right at Infowars.com.
[00:52:28.048 --> 00:52:29.829]  You go to the front page of Infowars.com.
[00:52:29.849 --> 00:52:31.010]  It says global exclusive.
[00:52:32.952 --> 00:52:37.695]  FBI directed CNN crew at Stone Raid.
[00:52:38.636 --> 00:52:39.236]  It's all there.
[00:52:39.436 --> 00:52:40.677]  Nobody bought their lies.
[00:52:40.717 --> 00:52:41.137]  We know that.
[00:52:41.177 --> 00:52:41.678]  But here's the deal.
[00:52:41.938 --> 00:52:42.839]  They've been caught.
[00:52:43.399 --> 00:52:47.802]  And it shows if one part of an investigation breaks the law and is a fraud, all of it's over.
[00:52:48.142 --> 00:52:49.383]  But they've done it and done it and done it.
[00:52:49.403 --> 00:52:50.304]  There's no rush again.
[00:52:51.305 --> 00:52:52.926]  The crime is trying to reach out and get
[00:52:55.694 --> 00:52:57.376]  WikiLeaks on, everybody was trying that.
[00:52:59.018 --> 00:53:01.961]  I mean, hell, CNN and the New York Times were talking to Goose for 2.0.
[00:53:02.502 --> 00:53:02.882]  We weren't.
[00:53:03.283 --> 00:53:04.224]  Other than text messages.
[00:53:04.564 --> 00:53:05.625]  So, yeah, we're journalists.
[00:53:05.665 --> 00:53:06.146]  It's what we do.
[00:53:06.186 --> 00:53:07.067]  We get big scoops.
[00:53:07.528 --> 00:53:08.409]  Time and time again.
[00:53:08.649 --> 00:53:09.690]  And that's my crime.
[00:53:10.571 --> 00:53:11.312]  Is we're dogging.
[00:53:11.352 --> 00:53:11.472]  So.
[00:53:12.512 --> 00:53:23.761]  I need your financial support if you want this operation to... I'm about to pull the trigger on expanding, which they've backed us off over a year we've been behind, or contracting, because there's no stay the same size.
[00:53:24.341 --> 00:53:30.226]  And I've got to make decisions here and be judicious about this, but I've always only expanded in the face of a fight.
[00:53:31.888 --> 00:53:33.089]  There's a Scorpion song about that.
[00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:34.129]  I forget the name.
[00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:35.850]  Don't stop at the top.
[00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:39.792]  Maybe we'll come in at the start of hour two, six after with that.
[00:53:39.852 --> 00:53:42.373]  But I think it's in the player in there.
[00:53:43.294 --> 00:53:53.879]  So that's what this is all about is doing the right thing and not being whims and actually measuring up to our forebearers and being Americans and acting like what Americans were known for instead of what we've turned into.
[00:53:54.939 --> 00:53:56.620]  So I make it easy at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:53:58.223 --> 00:54:05.725]  We have the best nutraceuticals, the best ultimate bone broth, 50% off, the best FDA-approved super silver.
[00:54:05.785 --> 00:54:06.785]  Nobody else has got this.
[00:54:07.506 --> 00:54:12.707]  We've got 50% off when you get the combo of that, because I know people need it right now in the winter with all the stuff that's going on.
[00:54:13.047 --> 00:54:14.468]  Brain Force, the amazing nootropic.
[00:54:14.488 --> 00:54:18.449]  We just went out and looked at top brands that were 60, 70 bucks and said, let's make it even stronger.
[00:54:18.469 --> 00:54:20.029]  See, I don't reinvent the wheel.
[00:54:20.089 --> 00:54:23.590]  It's top selling, has five stars, everybody loves it, it's tested, it's clean.
[00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:25.211]  I go, what's the markup on that?
[00:54:25.231 --> 00:54:26.471]  Oh, they're marking it up five times.
[00:54:27.156 --> 00:54:32.082]  Okay, well let's make it even stronger and only mark it up 150% and then discount it 50%.
[00:54:33.544 --> 00:54:35.506]  I believe people will recognize that and will want that.
[00:54:35.546 --> 00:54:38.109]  Well, at 50% off, we're basically not even making any money on it.
[00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:39.451]  But I want you to try.
[00:54:39.471 --> 00:54:41.133]  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's...
[00:54:42.847 --> 00:54:51.569]  Kissing Cousin, you could say, and that would be the turbo force that's beyond energy drink replacement, beyond pre-workout, beyond anything.
[00:54:51.589 --> 00:55:05.271]  You better take half a pack the first time you take it, because it's got all the synergistic minerals and vitamins and cofactors and amino acids that upload it, and a wide spectrum of known Mother Nature-based energy that absolutely delivers it like nothing you've experienced.
[00:55:06.472 --> 00:55:07.012]  Hell, there's only
[00:55:08.123 --> 00:55:10.204]  You're going to have the floor when we get back.
[00:55:10.224 --> 00:55:13.867]  We're going to play all the footage, but I want people to know, this is a big deal.
[00:55:36.081 --> 00:55:39.246]  Like, we're not making friends with stuff like this.
[00:55:39.686 --> 00:55:40.948]  They're going to try to gag you tomorrow.
[00:55:41.008 --> 00:55:44.333]  You weren't going to release this until they leaked it to the Senate.
[00:55:44.653 --> 00:55:46.055]  We're going to talk about it all, but first off...
[00:55:46.994 --> 00:55:48.234]  I know the listeners have already come through great.
[00:55:48.514 --> 00:55:49.215]  We appreciate them.
[00:55:49.655 --> 00:55:50.555]  And, you know, you're employed here.
[00:55:50.575 --> 00:55:51.215]  That helps you some.
[00:55:51.235 --> 00:55:52.376]  But I know what those bills are like.
[00:55:52.636 --> 00:55:54.977]  You're having to move out of your house, move into an apartment, you told me.
[00:55:54.997 --> 00:55:56.757]  You've got a lot of other stuff going on.
[00:55:56.897 --> 00:55:58.938]  I know how much money it takes to fight Goliath.
[00:55:59.318 --> 00:56:03.039]  So people really should go to StoneDefenseFund.com, make a donation.
[00:56:03.319 --> 00:56:08.281]  They should go to StoneColdTruth.com and get a Roger Stone did nothing wrong shirt.
[00:56:08.301 --> 00:56:11.322]  They should understand that we have been picked for destruction.
[00:56:12.322 --> 00:56:18.047]  So that once we're destroyed, they can steal our identity once we're gagged, and make us into the demons they claimed we were.
[00:56:18.307 --> 00:56:21.370]  They've written us into their script, and it's important we break out of it.
[00:56:22.884 --> 00:56:24.105]  That's exactly right, Alex.
[00:56:24.145 --> 00:56:30.291]  And as I've said many times, the survival of InfoWars is absolutely crucial to my strategy to win this case.
[00:56:30.411 --> 00:56:35.236]  Because this is the only place where you can get the stone cold truth, where you can get all of it.
[00:56:35.336 --> 00:56:39.120]  Because they don't edit, we don't censor, we don't hide things.
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:47.548]  So I appreciate the thousands of my supporters in the InfoWars community who are buying great products at the InfoWars.com site.
[00:56:47.988 --> 00:56:51.810]  In giving to my legal defense fund at StoneDefenseFund.com.
[00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:58.233]  You can get my books at the Infowars.com site in the store at a better price than you can get them.
[00:56:58.493 --> 00:57:05.876]  You can give to me directly to pay for my incredibly expensive but very effective lawyers at StoneDefenseFund.com.
[00:57:06.496 --> 00:57:14.620]  We're in this fight together, but the chances of my surviving without a vibrant, robust Infowars out there where people can see it
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:15.881]  We're almost nil.
[00:57:16.001 --> 00:57:18.205]  So please, folks, support us both.
[00:57:18.265 --> 00:57:19.647]  We all need your support.
[00:57:19.807 --> 00:57:25.014]  Roger, I don't think... I'm going to tell you about the most chilling experience of my entire life.
[00:57:25.435 --> 00:57:26.256]  We're going to break, Roger.
[00:57:26.276 --> 00:57:26.917]  We'll come back and do that.
[00:57:27.077 --> 00:57:30.902]  Everyone, whether you're listening on AM, FM, TV, Internet, talk right now.
[00:57:31.243 --> 00:57:31.783]  We got...
[00:57:32.344 --> 00:57:35.005]  The FBI directing and working with the CNN reporter.
[00:57:35.165 --> 00:57:37.206]  We caught evil CNN red-handed.
[00:57:37.566 --> 00:57:41.348]  This is epic, but we got to push it through now, through the censors, the live feed.
[00:57:41.648 --> 00:57:43.389]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:46.070]  Right now, ladies and gentlemen, it's about to break.

[00:59:48.158 --> 00:59:49.379]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:49.739 --> 00:59:52.220]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[01:01:05.889 --> 01:01:06.990]  We kicked Hillary out.
[01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:10.730]  We're getting nationalists elected everywhere.
[01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:14.171]  We're catching corporate media and lies every day.
[01:01:15.091 --> 01:01:16.012]  Humanity's waking up.
[01:01:17.312 --> 01:01:20.333]  The Democrats are openly saying they support killing babies after they're born.
[01:01:21.353 --> 01:01:24.673]  The energy level of humanity is surging against this.
[01:01:25.534 --> 01:01:26.574]  I've got my finger on the pulse.
[01:01:28.595 --> 01:01:32.100]  But at the same time, those of us at the tip of the spear have to pay the piper.
[01:01:33.441 --> 01:01:39.229]  But everything we have in civilization is because other men and women paid the piper.
[01:01:40.791 --> 01:01:41.652]  And I'm not a sadist.
[01:01:41.772 --> 01:01:42.553]  I don't like pain.
[01:01:42.593 --> 01:01:43.495]  I don't like punishment.
[01:01:44.075 --> 01:01:45.858]  I just can't back down to criminals.
[01:01:48.564 --> 01:01:50.365]  So we're living in an epic time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:50.485 --> 01:01:52.507]  Roger, STEM Stations don't care this first five minutes.
[01:01:52.567 --> 01:01:54.948]  We are plunging into it next segment.
[01:01:54.968 --> 01:01:56.109]  I haven't been building this up.
[01:01:56.129 --> 01:02:00.311]  There's been issues and, you know, things obviously with all this HD video getting it ready.
[01:02:00.331 --> 01:02:02.913]  But we've got it all ready now and all prepared.
[01:02:03.854 --> 01:02:06.335]  I just want to be able to review it.
[01:02:06.375 --> 01:02:08.156]  And, you know, that takes time during breaks.
[01:02:08.697 --> 01:02:11.479]  So I've been working during little three and four minute, two minute breaks.
[01:02:14.005 --> 01:02:19.689]  We have some major breaking news that just adds cherry and nuts and chocolate sauce onto this Sunday.
[01:02:20.489 --> 01:02:39.301]  We'll play after the break, but Whitaker's come out and said that, that's acting Attorney General, and in congressional testimony we have the footage, deeply concerned that CNN was at Roger Stonerade, and now they're already calling for hearings, and Mueller's group has already lied and said they weren't involved, even though we have the metadata that you got and the footage now.
[01:02:40.502 --> 01:02:42.904]  These guys are really arrogant.
[01:02:43.684 --> 01:02:45.564]  And now I think they're in a lot of trouble, Roger.
[01:02:47.605 --> 01:02:59.127]  Well, the irony, of course, Alex, is CNN is now attempting to say that there's nothing extraordinary here, that they've been staking out my house every Friday, starting late Thursday night for months.
[01:02:59.527 --> 01:03:06.469]  Of course, the security camera video that we have proved that that is yet another bald-faced lie from CNN.
[01:03:07.089 --> 01:03:24.411]  There's just no question that the security camera footage that people are about to see clearly shows CNN showing up roughly 50 minutes before the raid on my home, shows them setting up their camera tripod almost exactly nine minutes before the FBI arrives.
[01:03:25.752 --> 01:03:43.961]  17 vehicles, two of them armored vehicles, two amphibious units in the backyard because I live on a canal, a helicopter overhead, 29 agents wearing night vision goggles, fully attired in SWAT gear, armored vests,
[01:03:44.501 --> 01:03:54.911]  All carrying assault weapons and sidearms, a huge metal device they use for bashing in the door in the unlikely event that I wouldn't open it.
[01:03:55.071 --> 01:03:55.872]  A ram.
[01:03:56.272 --> 01:03:56.873]  It's a battery ram.
[01:03:57.679 --> 01:04:09.067]  Yeah, this had to cost the taxpayers a half million dollars when they simply could have contacted my attorneys and I would have, like everybody else Mr. Mueller has indicted, turned myself in voluntarily.
[01:04:09.347 --> 01:04:15.651]  This was a show put on to poison the jury pool, to make me look guilty before I've had a chance to prove
[01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:17.992]  And Roger, now we've caught Mueller.
[01:04:18.032 --> 01:04:25.354]  I mean, the FBI's on record, the Mueller probe, saying we didn't tip him off, but they messed up and gave you metadata that they sent the warrant on the day before.
[01:04:25.374 --> 01:04:26.114]  That's a felony.
[01:04:26.574 --> 01:04:28.755]  And now they've been caught, and now there's an investigation.
[01:04:28.775 --> 01:04:40.978]  And when people see the footage, not the footage that got released when they raided him from CNN, not the footage that Sinclair just got leaked, a little bit of it that Roger was sent to the judiciary committees, no.
[01:04:41.258 --> 01:04:42.739]  The full footage.
[01:04:43.599 --> 01:04:46.481]  Both raw and blown up, because we zoom in on this.
[01:04:46.981 --> 01:04:48.122]  It's all coming up.
[01:04:48.722 --> 01:04:50.583]  The live feed is at InfoWars.com.
[01:04:50.763 --> 01:04:52.505]  Share the feed now.
[01:04:53.065 --> 01:04:54.626]  Everybody, get ready to grab these clips.
[01:04:54.966 --> 01:04:56.507]  They can't stop you getting them out everywhere.
[01:04:56.787 --> 01:04:58.408]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:04:58.708 --> 01:05:01.210]  The evidence of the organized racketeering by Mueller.
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:11.925]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[01:05:12.265 --> 01:05:25.434]  Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there, and we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[01:05:25.634 --> 01:05:30.197]  We also have another product, also produced by the same company, Immune Gargle.
[01:05:30.537 --> 01:05:34.040]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle.
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:43.345]  We're going to go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:43.805 --> 01:05:46.146]  This is a limited-time Immune Boost Special.
[01:05:46.566 --> 01:05:53.270]  Get Super Blue, Silver Immune Gargle, and Super Silver Wound Dressing for 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:56.711]  Again, this is a limited-time Immune Boost Special.
[01:05:56.912 --> 01:06:03.395]  Get Super Blue, Silver Immune Gargle, and Super Silver Wound Dressing for 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:12.481 --> 01:06:18.443]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:19.524 --> 01:06:39.591]  Alright, Roger Stone, Infowars.com investigative journalist.
[01:06:40.967 --> 01:06:44.049]  He's written New York Times best-selling books on the Kennedy assassination, you name it.
[01:06:44.669 --> 01:06:45.610]  That's how I got to know him.
[01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:52.033]  Years ago, interviewing him about Kennedy, then meeting him at a Kennedy event, and then I met him a couple years before Trump won the election.
[01:06:52.053 --> 01:06:53.114]  We became good friends.
[01:06:55.355 --> 01:07:00.218]  And now I've watched him caught up in the Mueller investigation, and then there's no Russiagate.
[01:07:00.398 --> 01:07:07.462]  They're just claiming that he tried to talk to WikiLeaks, which everybody admits we did, like everybody else did.
[01:07:09.235 --> 01:07:09.936]  It's amazing.
[01:07:10.516 --> 01:07:12.757]  And then Roger gets raided.
[01:07:13.158 --> 01:07:14.058]  CNN's there.
[01:07:15.119 --> 01:07:18.942]  I talked to Owen Schroer and our crew and I said, can you get on the plane tonight?
[01:07:19.842 --> 01:07:23.245]  They got there the night of the raid.
[01:07:24.105 --> 01:07:24.666]  Incredibly.
[01:07:25.847 --> 01:07:27.448]  And we're there.
[01:07:27.628 --> 01:07:29.829]  And I was saying, Roger, I want your surveillance footage.
[01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:31.390]  You said they took everything.
[01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:32.511]  They took all the DVRs.
[01:07:32.571 --> 01:07:33.232]  Everything's a wreck here.
[01:07:33.252 --> 01:07:34.753]  I have no computers, no equipment.
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:40.123]  Well, Roger will tell you the timeline, but later, they go, what's this DVR?
[01:07:40.544 --> 01:07:42.585]  And it's the raid.
[01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:43.986]  The FBI thought they'd taken it.
[01:07:44.026 --> 01:07:45.648]  They put tape over the cameras and the videos.
[01:07:46.408 --> 01:07:49.951]  And you watch it, and it's watching a crime in progress.
[01:07:50.952 --> 01:07:52.413]  A big political stunt.
[01:07:53.293 --> 01:07:54.815]  The warrant being leaked to the media.
[01:07:54.855 --> 01:07:55.775]  CNN messes up.
[01:07:56.116 --> 01:07:58.217]  Asking Roger questions and sends him the warrant.
[01:07:59.818 --> 01:08:03.141]  Again, they're like building their own traps for themselves.
[01:08:03.441 --> 01:08:04.282]  Just like the Bible says.
[01:08:05.737 --> 01:08:07.819]  And so, quite frankly, I'm arguing with Roger.
[01:08:07.839 --> 01:08:08.680]  I'm like, hey, listen.
[01:08:09.742 --> 01:08:12.765]  You know, I think that judge, if she's going to gag you, she's going to gag you.
[01:08:12.785 --> 01:08:14.347]  And I just think you ought to put the footage out.
[01:08:14.667 --> 01:08:15.888]  Well, I haven't really seen it.
[01:08:15.928 --> 01:08:16.729]  The lawyers have it.
[01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:17.470]  It's being handled.
[01:08:18.251 --> 01:08:20.914]  You know, I'm just too busy here trying to keep afloat.
[01:08:22.055 --> 01:08:25.379]  And so, OK, well, if you're going to release that footage, I hope we get some of the exclusives.
[01:08:25.839 --> 01:08:26.500]  That's what I'm all about.
[01:08:27.041 --> 01:08:28.182]  I'm a news organization.
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:44.650]  And then I'm at the office five o'clock last night and I'm actually in the control room where they're doing the war room because I mean they're talking about news and a shoot I'm gonna do in the next studio in like an hour and all of a sudden they go, hey have you seen this?
[01:08:45.211 --> 01:08:53.156]  And it's Sinclair Broadcasting with this footage that for whatever reason they night visioned out and made it look black and white to look cooler.
[01:08:53.216 --> 01:08:54.057]  It's color video.
[01:08:55.398 --> 01:08:59.201]  And they put all this stuff around it and do a bunch of weird stuff and
[01:09:00.154 --> 01:09:00.534]  I don't know.
[01:09:00.554 --> 01:09:00.815]  I don't know.
[01:09:00.875 --> 01:09:02.596]  I gotta get off air here.
[01:09:02.616 --> 01:09:03.277]  I gotta go.
[01:09:16.735 --> 01:09:19.978]  His lawyers probably rightfully said, look, this judge already gagged a bunch of people.
[01:09:19.998 --> 01:09:21.319]  She's in Mueller's pocket.
[01:09:22.059 --> 01:09:25.222]  But your profession is talking and writing, so they shouldn't be able to stop you.
[01:09:25.242 --> 01:09:26.383]  If not, we're going to appeal it, obviously.
[01:09:26.423 --> 01:09:28.364]  But let's not release this footage.
[01:09:29.065 --> 01:09:33.788]  Let's just give it to Congress so there's a copy there with the Judiciary Committee that's already investigating this.
[01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:37.251]  Because there are opening investigations of the raid, and the Senate especially.
[01:09:37.751 --> 01:09:41.855]  So they send it to them, upload it the way they want, and then all of a sudden we're blindsided.
[01:09:41.895 --> 01:09:42.555]  That's a whole other thing.
[01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.377]  Who leaked this to Sinclair?
[01:09:45.057 --> 01:09:46.057]  So that's a whole other thing.
[01:09:46.097 --> 01:09:46.698]  It's not us!
[01:09:47.298 --> 01:09:49.139]  Because I knew Roger had it, so Roger rushes.
[01:09:49.159 --> 01:09:54.601]  Well, Roger, we'll get this footage here in a moment, but everybody needs to understand, this needs to be built up like the Super Bowl.
[01:09:54.621 --> 01:10:00.923]  This is CNN caught red-handed with Mueller's rogue FBI splinter group.
[01:10:01.784 --> 01:10:03.224]  I mean, I hope it's a splinter group.
[01:10:03.244 --> 01:10:06.846]  Whitaker is decrying it right now, and I want to think they're telling the truth.
[01:10:08.263 --> 01:10:09.364]  This is just sensational.
[01:10:09.404 --> 01:10:11.986]  This is showing people hand in the cookie jar.
[01:10:12.526 --> 01:10:14.828]  Or, you know, the footage where the serial killer strangles the woman.
[01:10:14.848 --> 01:10:17.610]  I mean, you don't get out of this what we're about to show.
[01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:22.794]  But just walk through why this is so important because you're having that hearing tomorrow to gag you and we've talked about this.
[01:10:23.234 --> 01:10:28.438]  We both think they're going to try to use whoever leaked this against you when they're the ones that already leaked it.
[01:10:29.577 --> 01:10:35.603]  No, Alex, this could conceivably be my last interview on InfoWars, at least for a while.
[01:10:35.683 --> 01:10:36.604]  We just don't know.
[01:10:36.624 --> 01:10:39.707]  I do have a First Amendment right to defend myself.
[01:10:40.908 --> 01:10:47.915]  And the argument that I should be gagged because of my talking in defense of myself might poison a potential jury pool.
[01:10:47.955 --> 01:10:50.758]  Well, the government just poisoned the jury pool.
[01:10:51.358 --> 01:10:55.745]  By staging this incredible, over-the-top, Gestapo-type raid on my home.
[01:10:56.626 --> 01:11:00.932]  And by, you know, by making sure that CNN was there to record all of it.
[01:11:01.562 --> 01:11:04.424]  So, look, I didn't leak this tape.
[01:11:04.484 --> 01:11:06.145]  It was sent to the proper authorities.
[01:11:06.325 --> 01:11:08.567]  I'm grateful to Senator Lindsey Graham.
[01:11:08.647 --> 01:11:14.291]  I'm grateful to the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee who are looking into exactly what happened here.
[01:11:14.691 --> 01:11:19.394]  But the Sinclair footage is severely truncated.
[01:11:19.754 --> 01:11:24.938]  You can see the CNN crew in the background, but they're not clearly identified.
[01:11:25.018 --> 01:11:31.442]  That's why it was essential for InfoWars to open this whole thing up and get to the bottom of it and lay it out for people.
[01:11:31.922 --> 01:11:45.011]  Because it's chilling and it costs the taxpayers, who knows, a half million dollars unnecessarily to try to depict me like some kind of drug kingpin like El Chapo or Pablo Escobar.
[01:11:45.251 --> 01:11:52.316]  They try to make me look like a criminal before I've had a chance to assert my innocence in a court of law.
[01:11:52.777 --> 01:12:00.502]  So I'm grateful to InfoWars and Alex, your courage being willing to show the American people what really went down that day.
[01:12:00.802 --> 01:12:01.182]  That's right.
[01:12:01.222 --> 01:12:03.203]  We're showing Sinclair's version right now.
[01:12:03.223 --> 01:12:05.365]  I don't know why they made it black and white to look more scary.
[01:12:05.925 --> 01:12:09.767]  We're going to show you the real footage and CNN will go, oh, it's edited.
[01:12:09.787 --> 01:12:11.388]  They blurred the FBI people's faces.
[01:12:11.748 --> 01:12:12.849]  No, that's not doctored.
[01:12:12.909 --> 01:12:15.010]  That's not, that's not substantially changed.
[01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:17.191]  Blurring faces is not changing the truth of it.
[01:12:17.211 --> 01:12:22.254]  In fact, zooming in and blowing it up isn't doing that, but I guarantee you they're going to try to ignore this, Roger.
[01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:25.812]  And they're going to try to say that we've altered it.
[01:12:26.652 --> 01:12:29.234]  None of that's true, in a doctored form.
[01:12:29.535 --> 01:12:36.920]  We are showing you so you can zoom in and see the FBI, patting them on the back, directing them, doing it all with a CNN guy they say they knew nothing about.
[01:12:37.361 --> 01:12:37.861]  BS!
[01:12:38.221 --> 01:12:39.522]  They blocked both sides of the streets.
[01:12:39.862 --> 01:12:40.783]  He was already there waiting.
[01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:41.744]  They talked to him.
[01:12:42.084 --> 01:12:46.167]  They let him stay there, which you don't do on this kind of quote, felony raid like they did.
[01:12:47.188 --> 01:12:49.889]  Well, let me explain the difference between the black and white and the color.
[01:13:06.453 --> 01:13:12.464]  Remember, this pre-dawn raid began in the dark, and therefore the security cameras operate on infrared.
[01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:14.709]  That's why the images are black and white.
[01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:16.712]  Oh, then later it turns color.
[01:13:18.101 --> 01:13:18.621]  Exactly.
[01:13:19.482 --> 01:13:21.903]  So that is what has transpired.
[01:13:21.943 --> 01:13:24.064]  What I want to know is, who approved this?
[01:13:24.684 --> 01:13:27.605]  Did the FBI Director Christopher Wray approve this?
[01:13:27.966 --> 01:13:30.867]  Did the Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker approve this?
[01:13:31.307 --> 01:13:37.890]  Did the station chief of the FBI in Miami, a guy named Piero, who's known for these kind of brutal tactics,
[01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:39.372]  Did he approve this?
[01:13:39.772 --> 01:13:41.615]  Did Mr. Mueller order this?
[01:13:41.935 --> 01:13:44.018]  How far up the chain of command did it go?
[01:13:44.118 --> 01:13:46.982]  These are the questions I think Senator Graham should be asking.
[01:13:47.262 --> 01:13:53.190]  These are the questions that Matt Gaetz and Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows, all good men, should be asking.
[01:13:53.411 --> 01:13:54.051]  And let's be clear.
[01:13:56.454 --> 01:13:59.977]  As I predicted, as you predicted, they've heated up 84 investigations.
[01:14:00.737 --> 01:14:12.226]  Mueller's fake investigation probably is going to end in the next month, like they say, but it'll all then metastasize into all these other cancers, to use an accurate term.
[01:14:12.846 --> 01:14:14.447]  I mean, Trump needs to take action.
[01:14:14.487 --> 01:14:17.430]  He has them with this raid, with CNN.
[01:14:17.450 --> 01:14:19.351]  Haul these FBI people in.
[01:14:19.411 --> 01:14:20.312]  Who ordered him to do that?
[01:14:20.572 --> 01:14:22.653]  Who told him CNN could be in the middle of a raid?
[01:14:22.894 --> 01:14:24.335]  You know, this needs to end now.
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:27.862]  Well Alex, you know the worst part of this?
[01:14:28.002 --> 01:14:29.303]  I'm a tough guy, like you.
[01:14:29.323 --> 01:14:30.224]  You know, I'm a fighter.
[01:14:30.885 --> 01:14:31.606]  My poor wife...
[01:14:32.365 --> 01:14:33.466]  She's 73 years old.
[01:14:33.626 --> 01:14:34.707]  She's hearing impaired.
[01:14:34.767 --> 01:14:36.809]  She's a beautiful woman and she's in great shape.
[01:14:37.389 --> 01:14:54.562]  But why she was treated like this, why she was rousted out in the middle of the night, why she's made to stand in her bare feet in the middle of the street when she's been charged with no crime, why she can't call or return calls from my grandchildren or my children trying to call and see if grandma is alright.
[01:14:54.882 --> 01:14:55.883]  That's just outrageous.
[01:14:55.943 --> 01:14:57.024]  That's abusive.
[01:14:57.764 --> 01:15:02.626]  And then, as you know, her family fled Fidel Castro's gulag.
[01:15:02.906 --> 01:15:13.429]  So to accuse us of being Russian dupes or Russian spies when my family was crushed by Russian tanks in Budapest in 1956, that is the height of an insult.
[01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:15.370]  That's as insulting as it gets.
[01:15:15.690 --> 01:15:18.331]  No, it's the Clintons who are colluding with the Russians.
[01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:19.671]  It's Bill and Hillary.
[01:15:20.171 --> 01:15:22.872]  And then Uranium One and their cohort, Robert Mueller.
[01:15:22.932 --> 01:15:25.033]  They're the ones who were engaged in treason.
[01:15:25.233 --> 01:15:29.316]  Jeannie Rae headed up the cover up at her foundation and she's one of the prosecutors.
[01:15:29.676 --> 01:15:31.097]  This has never been done before.
[01:15:31.358 --> 01:15:34.120]  This is literally foxes running the hen house.
[01:15:36.241 --> 01:15:37.102]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:15:37.142 --> 01:15:44.607]  And look, I'm glad that you have the courage to show everything, because there is no other media outlet in America that has that kind of courage.
[01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:51.772]  You're not going to see this on CNN, or ABC, or NBC, or CBS, or even Sinclair.
[01:15:51.812 --> 01:15:53.413]  I think they're good people at Sinclair.
[01:15:53.733 --> 01:15:56.515]  But they gave you a little tiny snippet of what happened.
[01:15:56.816 --> 01:16:02.980]  This is the only place on the planet where you can see... And we will hear it when we come back.

[01:17:31.899 --> 01:17:34.021]  There's someone to gather the facts.
[01:17:34.841 --> 01:17:37.304]  To bring you the story.

[01:17:51.318 --> 01:17:53.019]  Knowing helps us decide.
[01:17:54.661 --> 01:17:56.903]  Knowing keeps us free.

[01:20:16.838 --> 01:20:20.802]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:20:21.783 --> 01:20:25.647]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:39.654]  Coming to you live from the InfoWars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[01:20:40.274 --> 01:20:43.495]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:43.635 --> 01:20:48.258]  Global exclusive video shows FBI directing CNN cameraman at Roger Stone raid.
[01:20:48.978 --> 01:20:51.759]  We're about to air that exclusive footage starting now.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:57.762]  We're also going to upload the raw footage as we speak to that page on InfoWars.com.
[01:20:59.203 --> 01:21:01.404]  I cannot overstate
[01:21:02.366 --> 01:21:04.292]  The importance of what you're about to see.
[01:21:06.204 --> 01:21:08.205]  Roger Stone, acting A.G.
[01:21:08.245 --> 01:21:21.632]  Whitaker, fuels flimsy conspiracy theory, that's Vox that calls for total censorship, that Mueller tipped off CNN about Stone's arrest when you even got them sending you emails with metadata showing they'd been sent the indictment the day before.
[01:21:22.153 --> 01:21:23.253]  And then acting A.G.
[01:21:23.293 --> 01:21:31.358]  Whitaker, deeply concerned that CNN was at Roger Stone's raid, and now is at the center of hearings today, right as they're having the hearings.
[01:21:31.398 --> 01:21:32.618]  We couldn't have planned this better.
[01:21:32.658 --> 01:21:33.039]  We didn't.
[01:21:34.019 --> 01:21:39.062]  You just sent it on to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees as a good citizen.
[01:21:39.662 --> 01:21:44.084]  Somebody leaks out the weakest part of it to Sinclair, but now this is all starting to unfold.
[01:21:44.124 --> 01:21:44.885]  This is huge, Roger.
[01:21:46.570 --> 01:21:55.115]  Well, and I'm told that Senator Collins from Maine questioned the FBI director today as to why CNN was permitted to be on the scene.
[01:21:55.575 --> 01:22:05.521]  If I was theoretically dangerous, which is the whole premise of their raid on my home, then why was a CNN camera crew allowed to set up 25 feet from my front door?
[01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:11.924]  My neighbors who were walking their dogs were told to go back in their homes because it was a dangerous situation.
[01:22:12.304 --> 01:22:14.886]  The street was sealed off to all traffic.
[01:22:15.246 --> 01:22:17.930]  So why was CNN allowed to stay there?
[01:22:18.251 --> 01:22:23.018]  And CNN's claim that they staked out my house every Friday for months is a lie.
[01:22:23.358 --> 01:22:29.086]  I have security camera footage that proves yet again that CNN is lying.
[01:22:29.247 --> 01:22:29.908]  Wolf Blitzer.
[01:22:30.428 --> 01:22:34.130]  Jake Tapper, Sarah Murray, these people are busted.
[01:22:34.330 --> 01:22:36.451]  They're not journalists, they're just liars.
[01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:39.553]  Now they'll hide behind their journalistic privileges.
[01:22:39.853 --> 01:22:42.214]  But the government doesn't allow that.
[01:22:42.314 --> 01:22:46.596]  So, Mr. Mueller, Mr. Weissman, the FBI director,
[01:22:46.776 --> 01:22:47.757]  We're good to go.
[01:23:17.537 --> 01:23:24.600]  Are you familiar from public reports or otherwise that a CNN reporter was camped out outside of Stone's house when the FBI arrested him?
[01:23:30.043 --> 01:23:31.784]  This wouldn't be part of the investigation.
[01:23:31.884 --> 01:23:37.407]  I am aware of that and it was deeply concerning to me as to how CNN found out about that.
[01:23:37.467 --> 01:23:40.249]  I'm glad we're going down that road.
[01:23:40.269 --> 01:23:45.552]  Did somebody at the Department of Justice seemingly share a draft indictment with CNN prior to Stone's arrest?
[01:23:46.856 --> 01:23:49.158]  Or prior to a grand jury's finding of a true bill.
[01:23:54.843 --> 01:23:55.943]  Ranking Member Collins.
[01:23:57.383 --> 01:24:03.008]  The court had a sealed indictment that after Mr. Stone's arrest was unsealed.
[01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:18.183]  Consistent with all its prior indictments, the DOJ's basic policy for transparency in criminal cases is that the indictment is posted on the DOJ webpage promptly after it's unsealed and then media outlets were notified.
[01:24:20.253 --> 01:24:31.318]  We do not know of any, and I do not know of any other special counsel's office notice or DOJ notice to media outlets regarding Mr. Stone's indictment or his arrest.
[01:24:31.758 --> 01:24:38.281]  And otherwise, you know, I really, as I sit here today, don't have any other information that I can talk about regarding Mr. Stone.
[01:24:38.421 --> 01:24:40.342]  Okay, but Roger Stone does have that.
[01:24:40.382 --> 01:24:41.483]  We'll cover that next segment.
[01:24:41.503 --> 01:24:43.704]  But, I mean, Roger, you can smell it.
[01:24:44.324 --> 01:24:44.984]  Like the Whitaker...
[01:24:46.745 --> 01:24:49.848]  I mean, all of this, you can see that they know what's happening.
[01:24:49.868 --> 01:25:00.095]  We see all these criminal recommendations from the Inspector General of the Justice Department, that FBI agents have been involved in criminal activity against Trump, against you, against others.
[01:25:00.515 --> 01:25:01.996]  This is a leftist cabal.
[01:25:02.076 --> 01:25:02.997]  It must be rooted out.
[01:25:03.017 --> 01:25:04.498]  I think we're getting very close to it, Roger.
[01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:11.823]  Well, as you know, yesterday, Apple agreed to hand over my passwords to the Mueller investigative team.
[01:25:11.863 --> 01:25:20.915]  Now, they refused to turn over the passwords for the Pulse nightclub shooter or for the San Bernardino mass murderer because they wanted to protect their privacy rights.
[01:25:21.936 --> 01:25:28.501]  The reason I suspect they want my Apple ID is to see whether I destroyed any evidence or erased any files.
[01:25:28.521 --> 01:25:29.422]  The answer is no.
[01:25:29.682 --> 01:25:39.069]  Mr. Mueller, however, did erase the text messages of Mr. Stroke and Lisa Page, which is, of course, destruction of evidence.
[01:25:39.349 --> 01:25:42.031]  So there's a walking indictment right there, Mr. Whitaker.
[01:25:42.332 --> 01:25:43.613]  What are you waiting for?
[01:25:44.373 --> 01:25:46.175]  Or is it okay for them to destroy evidence?
[01:25:46.575 --> 01:25:48.036]  I have destroyed nothing.
[01:25:48.557 --> 01:25:50.238]  I have erased nothing.
[01:25:50.698 --> 01:25:54.421]  The records that they examine will be identical to the records they already have.
[01:25:54.761 --> 01:25:56.642]  Three terabytes of data.
[01:25:56.922 --> 01:26:09.271]  But if the government thinks that they're not going to be able to hide the fact that they had me under surveillance in 2016, that they had an illegal warrant to surveil me during Donald Trump's presidential campaign,
[01:26:09.551 --> 01:26:12.894]  That they were eavesdropping on my conversations with candidate Trump.
[01:26:13.074 --> 01:26:16.156]  They're not going to be able to hide the ball, although they're going to try.
[01:26:16.437 --> 01:26:18.778]  The New York Times reported that on January 20th, 2017.
[01:26:19.899 --> 01:26:22.081]  You were with me that day in Washington, Alex.
[01:26:22.461 --> 01:26:23.682]  It blew our minds.
[01:26:23.963 --> 01:26:26.485]  The New York Times refuses to retract that story.
[01:26:26.765 --> 01:26:29.527]  The reporter insists it was correct and is correct.
[01:26:29.847 --> 01:26:31.308]  Why was I being spied on in 2016?
[01:26:31.409 --> 01:26:34.271]  We're going to get to the bottom of all of this.
[01:26:34.611 --> 01:26:38.293]  And again, I've not been building this up here for the last 45 minutes without getting the footage.
[01:26:38.633 --> 01:26:41.034]  There's just so many angles and who leaked it.
[01:26:41.234 --> 01:26:42.994]  And now you're about to see the real footage.
[01:26:43.034 --> 01:26:53.279]  And as we speak, I told Rob Dewey 15 minutes ago, we've got the raw footage and then we've got it blown up of the FBI, literally like Stanley Kubrick or Steven Spielberg.
[01:26:54.482 --> 01:26:55.343]  I don't think so.
[01:27:12.102 --> 01:27:23.705]  And of the Waterloo and Roswery Bear Creek, next segment we'll show the raw footage, and then we speed it up because it's 30 minutes of them sitting there, and then we'll give you the blown-up footage, but it's all being uploaded to Infowars.com and Newswars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:27:23.785 --> 01:27:29.326]  Please, folks, understand, they don't want a free and independent media in America.
[01:27:29.666 --> 01:27:32.347]  They don't want groups and organizations that are willing to stand up and tell the truth.
[01:27:33.187 --> 01:27:34.388]  They want a bunch of yes-men.
[01:27:34.448 --> 01:27:35.028]  We're not that.
[01:27:37.435 --> 01:27:38.015]  The power.
[01:27:38.735 --> 01:27:40.396]  I'm willing to go all the way against the globalists.
[01:27:40.456 --> 01:27:41.056]  I believe we can win.
[01:27:41.076 --> 01:27:42.016]  We've already had big victories.
[01:27:42.056 --> 01:27:54.279]  But they know that InfoWars is a flashpoint, a focal point, a launch point, a rallying point, a signet, a standard, a flag of freedom and will and what's left of Americana.
[01:27:54.519 --> 01:27:58.379]  But that little fire of InfoWars has already set giant fires.
[01:27:58.799 --> 01:28:00.760]  And they're dealing with those fires right now and they're worried
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:04.000]  That we're going to set new brush fires in the minds of men and women.
[01:28:04.301 --> 01:28:05.041]  Yes, we are.
[01:28:05.201 --> 01:28:07.861]  But only you can feel the sails.
[01:28:07.981 --> 01:28:09.361]  You are the InfoWars.
[01:28:09.401 --> 01:28:13.782]  So, spread the live links at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:28:13.842 --> 01:28:14.802]  Spread the live link.
[01:28:14.862 --> 01:28:15.742]  Global exclusive.
[01:28:15.843 --> 01:28:18.923]  FBI directed the raid on Stone's house with CNN.
[01:28:19.983 --> 01:28:20.743]  It's a scandal.
[01:28:20.803 --> 01:28:22.684]  It's in Congress in hearings today.
[01:28:22.924 --> 01:28:24.284]  And we have them!
[01:28:25.684 --> 01:28:27.685]  It's a test of our will versus their will.
[01:28:27.785 --> 01:28:29.205]  Can you get the articles out?
[01:28:29.245 --> 01:28:29.925]  And then separately.
[01:28:30.919 --> 01:28:37.340]  The very best air filters, the very best water filters, the very best non-GMO heirloom seeds, the very best supplements.
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.261]  Everybody needs the highest quality turmeric.
[01:28:40.301 --> 01:28:41.101]  We've got bodies.
[01:28:41.221 --> 01:28:52.583]  Everybody needs the other great quality products like super silver wound gel that nobody else has got, FDA approved, or Brain Force Plus and the new Turbo Force, 50% off.
[01:28:53.223 --> 01:28:55.943]  All right, good old George Strait takes us out.
[01:28:56.043 --> 01:28:57.884]  We will be back with the Global Exclusive.
[01:28:58.164 --> 01:28:58.724]  Please spread the word.
[01:29:03.125 --> 01:29:07.248]  All the time, people come up to me on the street and they say, man Alex, how you taking it?
[01:29:07.288 --> 01:29:12.292]  We're sure sorry for you, the boycotts, the demonization, the lies, the lawsuits.
[01:29:12.312 --> 01:29:13.753]  How are you taking it?
[01:29:13.773 --> 01:29:16.556]  And quite frankly, I tell them I'm taking it good.
[01:29:17.256 --> 01:29:23.501]  I'm sad for my children and my family, because sometimes people get in their faces as well and say things about me that aren't true.
[01:29:23.522 --> 01:29:24.582]  But you know what?
[01:29:24.763 --> 01:29:25.964]  It wasn't free.
[01:29:26.983 --> 01:29:35.511]  What our forebears did in 1776, and it wasn't free in the Civil War, and the things we went through to try to end slavery, and other horrible events like that.
[01:29:36.272 --> 01:29:38.814]  But, you know, at the end of the day, that's what makes us who we are.
[01:29:39.955 --> 01:29:42.477]  And so, I'm quite honored to be in this position.
[01:29:43.078 --> 01:29:49.264]  I want to win in the end, and I realize that we are bound together in this struggle.
[01:29:50.219 --> 01:29:57.124]  This isn't just Alex Jones, this is the audience of activists who are in the arena that Teddy Roosevelt talked about.
[01:29:57.645 --> 01:30:05.531]  When you support influencers, however you do that, spreading the word, praying for us, financially supporting us, and getting great products at the same time, you are.
[01:30:06.051 --> 01:30:10.215]  Literally involved in a symbiotic relationship that's already changed the world.
[01:30:10.515 --> 01:30:15.979]  And so they know that we got that witch who was supposed to be the anointed queen defeated in 2016.
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:25.788]  They know that together we did that and they don't want to see that happen again with Kamala Harris or with Pocahontas or with Bernie Sanders or any of these other horrible globalists.
[01:30:26.408 --> 01:30:27.889]  And so that's why they're trying to crush us.
[01:30:28.209 --> 01:30:30.051]  Because we changed the world.
[01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:32.733]  We did some incredible things together.
[01:30:32.993 --> 01:30:36.255]  And we can go on and do great things together as well.
[01:30:36.856 --> 01:30:38.457]  America's waking up to the censorship.
[01:30:38.517 --> 01:30:40.798]  America is waking up to the oppression of the tyranny.
[01:30:41.219 --> 01:30:49.024]  There are a lot of rumblings and a lot of creaking and exploding and popping inside the system taking place right now.
[01:30:49.445 --> 01:30:50.245]  So understand this.
[01:30:51.086 --> 01:30:53.868]  The enemy tries to put out this aura of arrogance and supremacy.
[01:30:54.208 --> 01:30:55.069]  But they're not supreme.
[01:30:55.929 --> 01:31:01.055]  And if you look at the videos that they censor most off YouTube and Facebook, it's videos of 2016.
[01:31:01.415 --> 01:31:10.704]  On November 8th, that night, going into November 9th, when Hillary lost... Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[01:31:14.002 --> 01:31:18.844]  And those arrogant, smug creatures on the left who are panicking and screaming and freaking out.
[01:31:19.324 --> 01:31:23.026]  They want that memory expunged because they don't want us to have a victory.
[01:31:23.627 --> 01:31:26.908]  InfoWars is under attack and demonized because we're a success story.
[01:31:27.428 --> 01:31:29.469]  And they don't want you to be successful.
[01:31:29.489 --> 01:31:36.132]  They don't want you to believe in yourself and believe in your country and believe in a future destiny for all of us to have a better world than Martin Luther King.
[01:31:36.152 --> 01:31:41.155]  That's why I'm going to leave you with this important analysis with some clips of that night to remind you
[01:31:41.929 --> 01:31:44.971]  Of how far we've come, and how far we're going to go.
[01:31:45.891 --> 01:31:48.132]  And that these arrogant globalists will be defeated.
[01:31:49.093 --> 01:31:58.277]  And then in the final equation, please remember, InfoWareStore.com, because it is your financial support, shopping with us, with the good guys, that's already changed the world.
[01:31:58.477 --> 01:32:02.419]  And which Republican candidate has the best chance of winning the general election?
[01:32:02.759 --> 01:32:04.060]  Right now, Donald Trump.
[01:32:08.826 --> 01:32:11.435]  Donald Trump is running for president!
[01:32:11.555 --> 01:32:11.936]  Do it!
[01:32:13.557 --> 01:32:14.537]  Just do it.
[01:32:14.577 --> 01:32:14.997]  Look at me.
[01:32:15.997 --> 01:32:16.338]  Just do it.
[01:32:17.078 --> 01:32:26.859]  I will personally write you a campaign check now on behalf of this country, which does not want you to be president, but which badly wants you to run.
[01:32:27.059 --> 01:32:29.460]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president.
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:32.280]  So right now we have Hillary as about a 75 or an 80% favorite.
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:33.861]  We have different persons.
[01:32:33.921 --> 01:32:35.301]  I think it's a landslide for Hillary.
[01:32:35.321 --> 01:32:37.941]  You still think she has a 100% chance of winning the election?
[01:32:38.001 --> 01:32:38.341]  I do.
[01:32:38.461 --> 01:32:41.182]  We have the presidency at about 89% for Hillary.
[01:32:43.002 --> 01:32:44.944]  Right now, a historic moment.
[01:32:44.964 --> 01:32:47.646]  We can now project the winner of the presidential race.
[01:32:47.686 --> 01:32:50.909]  CNN projects Donald Trump wins the presidency.
[01:32:50.949 --> 01:32:51.970]  You're awake, by the way.
[01:32:52.651 --> 01:32:54.552]  You're not having a terrible, terrible dream.
[01:32:54.653 --> 01:32:56.854]  Also, you're not dead and you haven't gone to hell.
[01:32:57.535 --> 01:32:58.336]  This is your life now.
[01:32:58.476 --> 01:32:59.377]  This is our election now.
[01:32:59.477 --> 01:32:59.937]  This is us.
[01:33:00.097 --> 01:33:00.738]  This is our country.
[01:33:01.438 --> 01:33:01.779]  It's real.
[01:33:05.962 --> 01:33:08.605]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.846 --> 01:33:20.848]  Waging War on Corruption.
[01:33:21.209 --> 01:33:22.590]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.974 --> 01:33:39.108]  What we're now covering live on this Friday global transmission with Roger Stone from his home in Florida, where he's besieged by reporters, having to move out, move into a small apartment because he's almost bankrupt thanks to Mueller's witch hunt.
[01:33:40.239 --> 01:33:43.240]  His punishment for Stone helping defeat Hillary.
[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:47.882]  My punishment is what you obviously see, that he platforming lawsuits, the total demonization.
[01:33:47.902 --> 01:33:48.423]  But it's okay.
[01:33:48.463 --> 01:33:49.283]  I knew I was in a war.
[01:33:49.303 --> 01:33:52.484]  I just want folks to recognize, we are the tip of the spear.
[01:33:52.764 --> 01:33:55.265]  We're the rallying point with the flag, and we're under attack.
[01:33:55.606 --> 01:34:00.087]  So StoneDefenseFund.com, MFullRestore.com, support us please.
[01:34:00.107 --> 01:34:03.089]  Go to his site, StoneColdTruth.com, get a t-shirt.
[01:34:03.829 --> 01:34:07.510]  Go to Infowars.com forward slash, you know, show, spread the links.
[01:34:07.670 --> 01:34:09.211]  Whatever you do, realize it's a fight.
[01:34:09.471 --> 01:34:14.092]  And I keep reminding you, I know a lot of you are out there hammering hard and taking action.
[01:34:14.152 --> 01:34:18.554]  I'm just telling those that kind of passively tune in, this is history, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:19.850 --> 01:34:22.811]  And I bet on the American people, I bet that you'd want to be free.
[01:34:23.292 --> 01:34:24.712]  I bet that you'd want jobs back.
[01:34:24.832 --> 01:34:26.413]  I bet that you wanted to have a good future.
[01:34:27.013 --> 01:34:27.733]  I sure know I do.
[01:34:28.414 --> 01:34:31.535]  And I bet that you'd see people ridiculed, lied about, you'd see through it.
[01:34:31.555 --> 01:34:38.518]  And a lot of you have, but I think there's just so much media out there, sometimes people just don't get that everybody's trying to act like they're the tip of the spear.
[01:34:38.558 --> 01:34:40.139]  And hell, I wish they were, we wouldn't be in this trouble.
[01:34:40.599 --> 01:34:41.540]  But we are the tip of the spear.
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.521]  I've been banging heads with the globals for 25 years.
[01:34:44.561 --> 01:34:44.961]  On Air 24.
[01:34:47.642 --> 01:34:51.644]  In the last decade, man, I've been over the target because of having a big, powerful audience.
[01:34:52.324 --> 01:34:53.124]  And that's what they fear.
[01:34:53.144 --> 01:34:53.765]  They fear you.
[01:34:53.825 --> 01:34:56.386]  This attack is about taking your life over.
[01:34:56.766 --> 01:35:05.029]  So, without further ado, Roger Stone, we're going to start airing the audio, you know, free video of what happened.
[01:35:05.049 --> 01:35:07.310]  I think it's the exclusive raid footage and more.
[01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:11.052]  But again, I don't want, it's bad you being handcuffed and your wife and all the rest of it.
[01:35:11.532 --> 01:35:13.333]  And that's pretty powerful footage and it's exclusive.
[01:35:14.133 --> 01:35:19.638]  The CNN, as you pointed out on the phone to me this morning, that's really what's so incredible here.
[01:35:20.279 --> 01:35:27.506]  Showing that Mueller lied, showing they lied, of course showing that they illegally leaked this to CNN, as you have the metadata.
[01:35:27.746 --> 01:35:31.730]  So you have them and the Attorney General, the acting Attorney General says he's pretty upset about this.
[01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:36.034]  So this is really pertinent information right now that's essential to exposing the deep state.
[01:35:37.745 --> 01:35:45.350]  Well, evidently the Acting Attorney General said he's willing to address the overuse of force in a closed hearing, but not in public.
[01:35:45.770 --> 01:35:47.992]  That's the problem with this whole investigation.
[01:35:48.352 --> 01:35:50.433]  Everything is being done behind closed doors.
[01:35:50.874 --> 01:35:55.897]  I wanted to testify before the House Intelligence Committee in open session for the TV cameras.
[01:35:56.037 --> 01:35:56.858]  It was not allowed.
[01:35:57.398 --> 01:36:00.260]  Adam Schiff lied in that hearing again and again and again.
[01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:03.002]  Mr. Schiff will be on the stand at my trial.
[01:36:03.642 --> 01:36:05.904]  Eric Swalwell will be on the stand in my trial.
[01:36:06.284 --> 01:36:13.448]  Congressman, put aside about a day and a half because we got a lot of questions for you under oath, some of you haven't experienced in a while.
[01:36:13.548 --> 01:36:15.169]  No more congressional immunity, dude.
[01:36:15.429 --> 01:36:25.335]  We need to know all about what you have done and why you handled the inquiries from the Russians the way you did, trying to sell you naked pictures of the president.
[01:36:25.635 --> 01:36:26.976]  Alex, let's get to this footage.
[01:36:27.637 --> 01:36:29.118]  My heart is in my throat here.
[01:36:29.138 --> 01:36:33.542]  I had trouble watching this, to be honest with you, when the lawyer showed it to me.
[01:36:34.643 --> 01:36:40.327]  Interestingly enough, when the FBI came to the house, they ripped out the hardwire phones, so we no longer have that.
[01:36:40.688 --> 01:36:47.894]  And it was only when I was trying to figure out how to reconnect the phones that I realized that there was a DVR drive here that hadn't been taken.
[01:36:48.294 --> 01:36:49.775]  That's the only reason we have this.
[01:36:50.115 --> 01:36:57.038]  The most chilling thing here is watching the FBI agent realize there's a camera and take a piece of tape and put it over the lens.
[01:36:58.399 --> 01:37:02.320]  We're gonna go to it and I'm not, I don't normally build something up and I haven't been building it up.
[01:37:03.161 --> 01:37:04.321]  It's just so insane.
[01:37:04.361 --> 01:37:05.182]  It's so big.
[01:37:06.002 --> 01:37:06.482]  It's crazy.
[01:37:06.502 --> 01:37:07.343]  So we're gonna start rolling.
[01:37:07.543 --> 01:37:08.603]  Only TV viewers can see this.
[01:37:08.643 --> 01:37:09.864]  Radio listeners, all subscribers.
[01:37:09.884 --> 01:37:14.006]  Start rolling the unedited, unblown up, raw footage and then we speed it up.
[01:37:14.086 --> 01:37:16.707]  So this is the CNN reporter.
[01:37:17.896 --> 01:37:20.498]  Arriving in regular time and this is unedited.
[01:37:20.538 --> 01:37:22.759]  We just speed it up so we're not sitting here for 30 minutes.
[01:37:23.819 --> 01:37:26.201]  And so the CNN reporter stops right in front of your driveway.
[01:37:26.221 --> 01:37:29.963]  Again, you have the subsequent DVRs that this never happened before.
[01:37:30.603 --> 01:37:31.984]  This guy's connected to the FBI.
[01:37:32.764 --> 01:37:36.086]  He pulls forward, checks the addresses, backs back up.
[01:37:38.868 --> 01:37:43.410]  And then we start speeding up the tape so that we're not sitting here again for 30 minutes waiting.
[01:37:44.791 --> 01:37:45.732]  And again,
[01:37:48.288 --> 01:37:51.850]  We're here watching this raw footage for TV viewers.
[01:37:51.870 --> 01:37:52.910]  You obviously see it now.
[01:37:53.070 --> 01:38:04.056]  The police start, the federal agents, the henchmen of Mueller start showing up here in a few minutes, and they come over and they talk to the camera person as if they already know who he is.
[01:38:04.076 --> 01:38:05.877]  Obviously, if a real raid's about to happen, get out of here.
[01:38:06.357 --> 01:38:08.438]  Then he sets up his tripod, and we're coming to talk to him.
[01:38:09.098 --> 01:38:11.880]  And then this happens three times at the end, right before Stone's taken out.
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:12.460]  They say, OK.
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.961]  They come over, pat him on the back, and they say, you can go.
[01:38:16.042 --> 01:38:17.903]  And he then leaves.
[01:38:21.861 --> 01:38:24.962]  You see my cat, Lucky, there, in front of the car.
[01:38:29.403 --> 01:38:31.503]  So, that's the raw footage.
[01:38:31.643 --> 01:38:34.424]  Now, let's go to the blown-up footage.
[01:38:34.444 --> 01:38:41.765]  We're now going to go to the blown-up, and obviously this went on over almost an hour, so sped-up footage, but we stop and slow down during the parts.
[01:38:42.025 --> 01:38:45.026]  So here's blown-up footage, the very same footage you just saw.
[01:38:46.348 --> 01:38:53.922]  You see us blow it up right there on the software, and then you see the CNN vehicle pull up.
[01:38:54.843 --> 01:38:57.829]  That looks like a Ford Expedition.
[01:38:59.548 --> 01:39:04.573]  And then he backs back up, as I said, and then we speed it through the next 45 minutes or so.
[01:39:04.613 --> 01:39:13.822]  But this is incredible because right there on the tape, just keep rolling it in live time, guys, because I spent a lot of time this morning on this, and I know it's on the tape.
[01:39:13.862 --> 01:39:15.423]  So let's go back to it.
[01:39:15.984 --> 01:39:16.985]  And we've got him sitting right there.
[01:39:21.195 --> 01:39:24.876]  And at a certain point, they show up and all this happens.
[01:39:24.896 --> 01:39:27.697]  We'll just keep that rolling while Roger is speaking.
[01:39:28.457 --> 01:39:29.437]  So continue, Roger.
[01:39:30.598 --> 01:39:36.940]  Well, you see the CNN crew there perched in front of my house.
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:45.482]  The time code is not correct because it was set incorrectly by the camera.
[01:39:45.522 --> 01:39:48.023]  But since we know the exact time of my arrest was
[01:39:48.610 --> 01:39:51.731]  Six o'clock, you can figure out the real times here.
[01:39:52.891 --> 01:39:54.652]  And we made that very clear.
[01:39:54.752 --> 01:40:01.313]  Now you see him get out of the car and you see him, the CNN crew.
[01:40:02.494 --> 01:40:03.574]  That's a neighbor there.
[01:40:04.914 --> 01:40:07.435]  You see him talk to whoever's in the car.
[01:40:08.295 --> 01:40:11.856]  That's most likely one of the FBI officials.
[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:20.087]  When the car pulls away, you will see him, or the car backs up, pardon me, you'll see him set up his tripod.
[01:40:20.427 --> 01:40:27.914]  Now, at this point, my neighbors who are out walking their dogs tell me that they were told to go back in their homes and stay there.
[01:40:28.624 --> 01:40:29.345]  We're good to go.
[01:40:45.778 --> 01:40:49.819]  FBI agents to take me and my 73-year-old wife into custody.
[01:40:50.259 --> 01:40:54.660]  Why is this man being permitted to stay 25 feet from my front door?
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:56.620]  Why is he allowed to do this?
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:08.783]  It's because there's a willful effort to poison the jury pool and depict me as a desperado, as the single most dangerous person in America, public enemy number one.
[01:41:09.203 --> 01:41:10.423]  That, despite the fact
[01:41:10.843 --> 01:41:16.108]  That I am not accused of any violent crime and have no previous record.
[01:41:16.228 --> 01:41:34.146]  In the front seat, Josh Campbell, the producer for CNN, former Special Assistant to FBI Director James Comey, a man who did lie to Congress under oath about many things, but has not yet had his home raided by the FBI.
[01:41:34.626 --> 01:41:36.427]  On the orders of Robert Mueller.
[01:41:37.487 --> 01:41:38.587]  CNN's very clever.
[01:41:38.627 --> 01:41:43.909]  They put another guy out front, not their FBI-connected producer.
[01:41:44.189 --> 01:41:45.229]  But they are busted.
[01:41:45.869 --> 01:41:48.510]  And everything they have said so far is a lie.
[01:41:48.910 --> 01:41:50.291]  They sent my lawyer.
[01:41:50.311 --> 01:41:53.752]  Now you see the FBI rolling up as the raid begins.
[01:41:54.112 --> 01:41:56.853]  The CNN camera is now running.
[01:41:56.893 --> 01:41:57.393]  You see him.
[01:41:57.753 --> 01:42:01.014]  He grabs the camera out of the car, films the FBI.
[01:42:01.574 --> 01:42:03.217]  Why isn't he being told to leave?
[01:42:03.498 --> 01:42:04.219]  I'm dangerous.
[01:42:05.982 --> 01:42:12.033]  The armed men now swarming into my front yard, fanning out to take me into custody.
[01:42:12.074 --> 01:42:12.735]  There you see it.
[01:42:13.638 --> 01:42:14.940]  God, this turns my stomach.
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:36.362]  And them saying, I never saw him, never knew what happened, never authorized it.
[01:42:36.422 --> 01:42:43.447]  And then the exclusive footage that dramatically is more powerful, where it shows Roger being let out in handcuffs and more.
[01:42:43.487 --> 01:42:48.991]  And that's all being uploaded to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:49.332 --> 01:42:50.312]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:50.472 --> 01:42:51.553]  Caught them red-handed.
[01:42:51.874 --> 01:42:53.895]  It really gets powerful on the other side.
[01:42:53.915 --> 01:42:54.415]  Stay with us.
[01:43:09.531 --> 01:43:10.852]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jessica.
[01:43:10.872 --> 01:43:12.434]  She wants to talk about the Virginia governor.
[01:43:12.915 --> 01:43:13.835]  Jessica, you're on the air.
[01:43:13.855 --> 01:43:15.637]  Looks like he'll be resigning soon.
[01:43:15.657 --> 01:43:16.078]  What do you think?
[01:43:16.678 --> 01:43:17.539]  I hope so.
[01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:19.962]  I never liked him from the beginning.
[01:43:20.202 --> 01:43:28.030]  I remember that President Obama endorsed him, and that was a big... I thought that would be a big wake-up call to people, but apparently it wasn't.
[01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:30.651]  But we keep the babies comfortable.
[01:43:30.671 --> 01:43:43.094]  I can't really do his fake southern accent, but it's just, I love southerners, you know, I'm from Texas, kind of southern, but it's like the fakeness of that sicky sweet, let's stay out of the ladies area, kill that baby.
[01:43:43.274 --> 01:43:53.857]  I think because he's a pediatrician, he's used to people, you know, kind of responding to that voice he does, but it sickens me that he's a pediatrician and he's pushing what he's pushing.
[01:43:53.917 --> 01:43:55.918]  But we're going to make the baby comfortable.
[01:43:57.078 --> 01:43:58.639]  Oh my gosh, it's so sickening.
[01:43:58.719 --> 01:44:01.360]  Well, we know in the end times this is the stuff that happens.
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:06.421]  That's why I'm so proud of you and the InfoWars team for all that you do.
[01:44:06.621 --> 01:44:08.942]  And I love, I wanted to say I love your products.
[01:44:09.182 --> 01:44:14.404]  I have X2 and the Selenium for my thyroid and I have to say that it's worked wonders.
[01:44:14.484 --> 01:44:16.844]  The BrainForce Plus is amazing.
[01:44:17.164 --> 01:44:18.985]  Me and my family take it every day and I mean
[01:44:18.985 --> 01:44:21.586]  I mean, you really can feel what it does.
[01:44:21.786 --> 01:44:26.808]  And usually I get a lot of brain fog from the thyroid issue, and that helps tremendously.
[01:44:26.848 --> 01:44:34.071]  And the knockout helps me sleep at night, especially when I have something important I have to get up and do in the morning and I don't feel that groggy feeling.
[01:44:34.171 --> 01:44:35.391]  And we use the toothpaste.
[01:44:35.431 --> 01:44:36.632]  We love the toothpaste.
[01:44:36.712 --> 01:44:40.373]  My son uses the krill oil for some issues that he deals with.
[01:44:40.413 --> 01:44:42.974]  My husband is a hardwood floor installer.
[01:44:43.034 --> 01:44:46.255]  He loves the bodies and he loves the Red Pill Plus.
[01:44:46.375 --> 01:44:48.236]  And we're going to try the Turbo Force next.
[01:44:48.816 --> 01:44:53.579]  I really want to get that turbo force because my son loves going to the gym and he needs something for a booze.
[01:44:53.659 --> 01:44:56.241]  Well, Jessica, I appreciate your support, but let me be honest with you.
[01:44:56.301 --> 01:44:57.682]  Only take a half pack at the first time.
[01:44:57.802 --> 01:44:59.703]  It's just, it's kind of like good crack.
[01:44:59.903 --> 01:45:01.965]  So, I'm almost embarrassed.
[01:45:02.345 --> 01:45:03.546]  Everybody should be careful with it.
[01:45:03.986 --> 01:45:04.687]  It's the next level.
[01:45:04.747 --> 01:45:05.187]  It's insane.
[01:45:05.367 --> 01:45:20.384]  I really am glad that I'm able to help the fight for truth and freedom and liberty and I don't know what where I would be and what I would think if I didn't have people like you one air who have just stayed strong through it all so I just want to encourage
[01:45:22.145 --> 01:45:26.367]  I mean, I don't know what we would do.
[01:45:26.407 --> 01:45:27.488]  We wouldn't have anybody.
[01:45:27.508 --> 01:45:31.610]  If there wasn't you, I mean, I don't know that anybody else would be on the air doing it.
[01:45:31.690 --> 01:45:38.494]  Like you said, you're the tip of the spear, so I really appreciate you and what you say, you know, helps me stay connected to the truth.
[01:45:38.574 --> 01:45:48.180]  It helps me stay connected to God, and I can't say enough about how much I love InfoWars, how much I love the products, but I would like to have some female cut shirts.
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:51.281]  No, no, I totally agree.
[01:45:52.121 --> 01:45:56.102]  We put out the one gold foil female shirt that was a big hit, and we're just brain dead.
[01:45:56.122 --> 01:45:58.583]  But I promise, that's our number one complaint, is from women.
[01:45:58.603 --> 01:46:00.523]  We've only got a couple shirts that are cut for females.
[01:46:00.583 --> 01:46:01.543]  We will get it done for you.
[01:46:01.583 --> 01:46:06.865]  But Jessica, you give me strength to go on, and your husband, and your family, because just hearing what's in your voice, the
[01:46:07.165 --> 01:46:14.250]  The powerful feminine energy and then the male energy together, all of us focused together against the globalists, is unstoppable.
[01:46:14.630 --> 01:46:19.153]  And that's why they're attacking that sacred system of the family, of all of us together.
[01:46:19.434 --> 01:46:20.334]  We are humanity.
[01:46:20.655 --> 01:46:21.635]  We are the experience.
[01:46:21.655 --> 01:46:22.396]  We are everything.
[01:46:22.836 --> 01:46:24.657]  And so you've just got my commitment to fight on.
[01:46:24.677 --> 01:46:26.939]  But let me tell you, I'm obnoxious most of the time.
[01:46:26.959 --> 01:46:27.519]  I'm burnout.
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:29.821]  Hearing you, I want to just say this.
[01:46:29.961 --> 01:46:30.662]  I'm not just telling you this.
[01:46:31.182 --> 01:46:32.283]  You are the info war.
[01:46:32.383 --> 01:46:33.684]  You're the power of the whole thing.
[01:46:34.204 --> 01:46:38.507]  And that's why I get so freaked out about begging the audience for help, because it's the truth!
[01:46:38.627 --> 01:46:39.708]  I mean, I'm not just saying it.
[01:46:39.828 --> 01:46:43.411]  If you weren't here, standing in the way, they would have already destroyed me.
[01:46:43.571 --> 01:46:44.752]  But we're in this together.
[01:46:44.912 --> 01:46:46.553]  So God bless you, Jessica from Virginia.
[01:46:46.573 --> 01:46:49.976]  And yeah, looking at that little pathetic gremlin governor.
[01:46:50.156 --> 01:46:51.557]  Of course he's KKK.
[01:46:51.677 --> 01:46:53.839]  Who the hell wants to harvest babies' organs?
[01:46:53.859 --> 01:46:55.300]  That's what that's all really about.
[01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:56.941]  These are demons.
[01:46:57.441 --> 01:46:58.962]  But thanks to you and others, we're gonna win.
[01:46:59.022 --> 01:46:59.683]  Thank you so much.
[01:47:06.832 --> 01:47:09.555]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.244 --> 01:47:22.387]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[01:47:23.388 --> 01:47:26.791]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:47:27.492 --> 01:47:29.033]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:55.695 --> 01:47:57.336]  So, Roger Stone is our exclusive guest.
[01:47:57.376 --> 01:48:08.904]  We just showed, if you are watching on television, the first time that the FBI comes up to CNN that's been there for 30 minutes, blocks the road, lets them stay there, wanders past them.
[01:48:08.944 --> 01:48:09.765]  The raid begins.
[01:48:10.465 --> 01:48:14.908]  And we're going to show you two more times on the footage where they talk to the reporter.
[01:48:14.948 --> 01:48:17.670]  They say they never saw, never knew, never directed.
[01:48:18.230 --> 01:48:20.692]  And then they tried to abscond with the evidence.
[01:48:21.132 --> 01:48:25.015]  They tried to obstruct justice of the crime they'd committed, leaking the felony warrant.
[01:48:25.755 --> 01:48:26.475]  All the rest of it.
[01:48:27.036 --> 01:48:27.936]  And this is all criminal.
[01:48:28.236 --> 01:48:28.796]  Very criminal.
[01:48:29.556 --> 01:48:32.017]  They then tried to cover up the cameras with tape.
[01:48:32.077 --> 01:48:33.118]  We have that footage coming up.
[01:48:34.118 --> 01:48:36.919]  They then tried to take the other DVR.
[01:48:37.259 --> 01:48:38.879]  They were unsuccessful doing that.
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:42.981]  So we have all that footage coming up for you in just a few minutes.
[01:48:43.521 --> 01:48:49.643]  But Roger, narrate this for us now as you watch from your home where this happened in Florida a few weeks ago with this global exclusive.
[01:48:49.963 --> 01:48:53.346]  That just shows the lie of Mueller, the fraud, the media, CNN lying.
[01:48:53.386 --> 01:48:55.047]  It's so huge, I just can't describe it.
[01:48:55.668 --> 01:49:05.476]  The next two times that the FBI talks to him, and the third time, right before you're let out, a group gets around the CNN reporters and tells them, get out of here.
[01:49:05.576 --> 01:49:06.296]  So let's roll that.
[01:49:08.538 --> 01:49:14.823]  So now you see the first of 17 FBI vehicles that arrived.
[01:49:14.863 --> 01:49:19.367]  You see the armed agents getting out of their trucks.
[01:49:20.289 --> 01:49:24.150]  Uh, two of the vehicles were armored vehicles.
[01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:26.691]  You see the CNN camera running.
[01:49:27.071 --> 01:49:31.733]  The FBI agent walked right by the camera, doesn't tell him to leave.
[01:49:32.193 --> 01:49:34.654]  Yet the street has been sealed at the end of the street.
[01:49:34.694 --> 01:49:35.954]  It's a dead end street.
[01:49:36.434 --> 01:49:38.976]  And my neighbors have been told to stay inside their houses.
[01:49:39.356 --> 01:49:43.539]  You see the cameraman taking pictures of the additional agents.
[01:49:43.579 --> 01:49:46.641]  You now see the agents swarming my home.
[01:49:47.041 --> 01:49:50.484]  What you can't see here is two boats have pulled up to the back.
[01:49:51.104 --> 01:49:59.029]  There you see the you can see a an FBI official speaking to the cameraman to the left of the picture.
[01:50:00.030 --> 01:50:02.852]  And in the back of the house at this exact time,
[01:50:03.152 --> 01:50:03.672]  We're good to go.
[01:50:22.777 --> 01:50:23.999]  Thank you very much.
[01:50:38.861 --> 01:50:40.582]  You see an additional agent.
[01:50:41.103 --> 01:50:50.892]  Now you see the FBI talking actively and telling them, OK, you guys got what you needed and they're finally being told to leave.
[01:50:51.313 --> 01:50:54.336]  So, again, the FBI is well aware that CNN is there.
[01:50:54.856 --> 01:50:56.276]  Well aware that they're filming.
[01:50:56.656 --> 01:50:58.057]  They walk right by them.
[01:50:58.117 --> 01:51:02.118]  They allow them to film the swarming of my home.
[01:51:02.518 --> 01:51:08.319]  Now they only tell them to leave when I'm about to be dramatically brought out in cuffs.
[01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:15.141]  I was, you know, obviously, I'm just seeing this footage close up for the first time.
[01:51:15.241 --> 01:51:16.781]  I've seen it from far away.
[01:51:16.801 --> 01:51:19.242]  It still turned my stomach.
[01:51:19.702 --> 01:51:25.424]  Now, you see the FBI directing their cohorts, their partners in crime at CNN.
[01:51:26.565 --> 01:51:36.169]  You can go to Stone Cold Truth right now if you want to learn more about my situation or if you want to contribute to Stone Defense Fund.
[01:51:36.469 --> 01:51:38.610]  There's a link right there at the Stone Cold Truth.
[01:51:38.970 --> 01:51:41.711]  There's a chilling example here.
[01:51:42.051 --> 01:51:43.492]  You can see I have been handcuffed.
[01:51:44.359 --> 01:51:49.002]  Again, we have the infrared cameras, which is why I'm wearing a black shirt, actually.
[01:51:49.423 --> 01:51:55.987]  But until the sun comes up, when you'll see the color of all the pictures dramatically shift to color.
[01:51:56.367 --> 01:52:02.231]  Notice on the right, there's a man holding a rifle still pointed at the picture window of my home.
[01:52:02.631 --> 01:52:10.096]  The FBI agent who was walking me out was very courteous and very polite, very professional, treated me well, gave me some water.
[01:52:10.477 --> 01:52:13.599]  Later on, he gave me a protein bar because I was getting hungry.
[01:52:14.159 --> 01:52:23.126]  But you see, I have been walked out to the street, and I've asked now to see my lawyer three times, and I was told I could see my lawyer later.
[01:52:23.206 --> 01:52:34.274]  And again, Roger, the huge issue here is, and we're going to have the rest of the footage next hour, is the issue of blurring the FBI agents' faces out became a big fiasco here, and that's why this is all behind, and hell, we may even have it today.
[01:52:34.834 --> 01:52:38.097]  It's your wife being marched out as well.
[01:52:38.398 --> 01:52:41.861]  It's them running around putting tape over all the cameras.
[01:52:42.221 --> 01:52:43.502]  That is all coming up next hour.
[01:52:43.542 --> 01:52:45.164]  I need you to stay with us.
[01:52:45.204 --> 01:52:46.865]  But I know you've got reporters right now.
[01:52:46.885 --> 01:52:49.568]  I can see you putting cameras through your window.
[01:52:49.608 --> 01:52:51.630]  You were just doing the Nixon salute.
[01:52:51.670 --> 01:52:53.812]  I mean this is just a crazy time to be alive.
[01:52:53.832 --> 01:52:55.693]  But I want to get the listeners ratcheted back into this.
[01:52:56.294 --> 01:53:07.920]  We're posting videos to Infowars.com and Newswars.com that are boildowns of the three times the FBI directed the CNN crew, one of which has worked for Comey.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:17.004]  They've been caught lying to the president, to the media, to Congress, releasing felony warrant information to CNN.
[01:53:17.064 --> 01:53:18.445]  CNN screwed up and sent that to you.
[01:53:18.805 --> 01:53:23.067]  I mean, this is going to be very powerful info for any congressional hearing, isn't it, Roger?
[01:53:24.059 --> 01:53:34.927]  No, it really is, and I'm very grateful that Senator Lindsey Graham is willing to get to the bottom of this, that he showed some leadership last week and wanted to know why this kind of excessive force was being used.
[01:53:35.407 --> 01:53:37.769]  Alex, you could expect this in Nazi Germany.
[01:53:37.829 --> 01:53:40.190]  You would expect this in Soviet Russia.
[01:53:40.230 --> 01:53:43.593]  Stalin would approve of Mr. Mueller's conduct here.
[01:53:44.053 --> 01:53:46.435]  I could have saved the taxpayers a half million dollars.
[01:53:46.995 --> 01:53:49.276]  They knew I was represented by competent counsel.
[01:53:49.316 --> 01:53:55.158]  Had they contacted them, I would have turned myself in voluntarily and I still would have pled not guilty.
[01:53:55.218 --> 01:53:59.320]  And I would have looked a hell of a lot better in my mugshot than the one they ultimately took.
[01:54:00.140 --> 01:54:11.845]  But instead they had to rouse me, terrorize my wife, who's 73 years old and hearing impaired, terrorize my dogs, who for two days wouldn't come out from under the bed and couldn't stop shaking,
[01:54:12.686 --> 01:54:14.527]  The cats seem to have taken it pretty well.
[01:54:14.588 --> 01:54:16.630]  There you see it again, one more time.
[01:54:16.990 --> 01:54:28.602]  The FBI directs the CNN camera operator the second time, telling him where to move his camera to make sure they get plenty of footage of the FBI agents swarming my home.
[01:54:29.103 --> 01:54:33.227]  They are wearing night goggles at this point because it is dark.
[01:54:34.395 --> 01:54:36.376]  And the sun has not yet come up.
[01:54:37.217 --> 01:54:48.127]  Now, finally, only after they're about to perp walk me out into the street, to the humiliation of all my neighbors, I might add, do they finally tell CNN to leave.
[01:54:48.488 --> 01:54:50.209]  They knew CNN was there.
[01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:53.552]  Sarah Murray of CNN coordinated this.
[01:54:53.913 --> 01:54:57.556]  This is why she called me the day before wanting my home address.
[01:54:57.916 --> 01:54:58.517]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:54:59.017 --> 01:55:02.860]  CNN says that they've been surveilling my home every Friday for months.
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:04.020]  That's a lie.
[01:55:04.361 --> 01:55:07.643]  I have the security camera footage that proves it was a lie.
[01:55:07.943 --> 01:55:11.165]  There you have it, 15 minutes before my arrest.
[01:55:11.225 --> 01:55:13.847]  Who pulls up but the CNN camera crew?
[01:55:14.187 --> 01:55:15.508]  CNN is busted.
[01:55:16.008 --> 01:55:19.792]  They will hide behind their journalistic privilege to avoid answering questions.
[01:55:20.192 --> 01:55:22.154]  But Mr. Mueller must be asked under oath.
[01:55:22.514 --> 01:55:24.956]  Mr. Weissman must be asked under oath.
[01:55:25.257 --> 01:55:29.641]  Mr. Pirro, the head of the FBI in Miami, must be asked under oath.
[01:55:31.142 --> 01:55:34.665]  Mr. Whitaker needs to be asked what he knew about this.
[01:55:34.765 --> 01:55:36.507]  I think the answer is nothing.
[01:55:36.847 --> 01:55:46.812]  And Christopher Wray, the most epically corrupt FBI director since J. Edgar Hoover, needs to be asked, what did he know about this and when did he know it?
[01:55:47.232 --> 01:55:56.476]  This is a man who lied to President Trump's face about whether the president was under investigation, lied to the Congress about it, yet there is no raid on his home.
[01:55:56.736 --> 01:55:58.597]  He's doing the raiding in this case.
[01:55:59.457 --> 01:56:03.720]  It's very hard to believe, Alex, that this could actually happen in America.
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:11.024]  Roger, I agree, but what about the biblical providence that they didn't get the right DVR and we have the footage?
[01:56:11.184 --> 01:56:16.827]  I mean, we have them now directing CNN, saying they didn't even know CNN was there, they had nothing to do with them.
[01:56:16.847 --> 01:56:17.768]  I mean, we have them.
[01:56:18.208 --> 01:56:20.992]  They're absolutely been caught red-handed, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:21.753 --> 01:56:22.934]  This is just incredible.
[01:56:22.974 --> 01:56:24.917]  It's all on tape.
[01:56:25.377 --> 01:56:27.060]  It's all coming up next hour.
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:29.483]  We just had to blur their faces out, so that took a while.
[01:56:30.584 --> 01:56:32.266]  And it's just incredible, Roger.
[01:56:32.287 --> 01:56:33.668]  I want to just say this very quickly.
[01:56:34.625 --> 01:56:37.247]  Please remember that InfoWars is under attack.
[01:56:37.267 --> 01:56:38.088]  It's one of the tip of the spear.
[01:56:38.929 --> 01:56:41.791]  And it's great products we sell that fund the operations.
[01:56:41.811 --> 01:56:46.915]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com and get 50% off the ultimate bone broth formula.
[01:56:47.376 --> 01:56:52.080]  They sell like, at Whole Foods, one little container that has like one scoop of what we sell in it for $10.
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:53.581]  This is $19.95, something like 50 servings.
[01:56:56.733 --> 01:57:07.778]  It's chaga mushroom, the highest quality bee pollen, the best bone broth from chicken broth, concentrated for your energy, for your bones, for your cartilage, for just everything.
[01:57:07.858 --> 01:57:08.578]  It's in the bones.
[01:57:09.518 --> 01:57:14.380]  They used to grind up, you know, the bones of chickens and cows and put it in the bread.
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:16.861]  They stopped doing that about 100 years ago.
[01:57:16.881 --> 01:57:18.862]  It's where you get the minerals.
[01:57:18.882 --> 01:57:20.062]  It's where you get the cofactors.
[01:57:20.443 --> 01:57:21.243]  It's where you get everything.
[01:57:21.303 --> 01:57:21.903]  It's in the bones.
[01:57:21.943 --> 01:57:22.724]  That's 50% off.
[01:57:22.984 --> 01:57:23.524]  Big sale.
[01:57:24.024 --> 01:57:25.925]  We've also got the new Turbo Force.
[01:57:27.310 --> 01:57:30.652]  A product that's beyond energy drink, beyond pre-workout.

[01:57:44.581 --> 01:57:45.802]  You are the InfoWars.
[01:57:46.042 --> 01:57:48.504]  And StoneDefenseFund.com for the fight he's in.
[01:57:48.524 --> 01:57:49.605]  We're all in this together.
[01:57:49.625 --> 01:57:50.065]  Stay with us.
[01:57:50.305 --> 01:57:51.566]  The other exclusive footage straight ahead.
[01:57:56.852 --> 01:57:58.173]  Here's the thing, I'm not giving up.
[01:57:58.873 --> 01:58:03.515]  Because I know we've got truth and justice on our side, but it takes money to wage this war.
[01:58:03.896 --> 01:58:07.617]  You're spreading the word, you're praying for us, and you're financially supporting us.
[01:58:07.878 --> 01:58:10.959]  It's key, it's essential, it's absolute like oxygen.
[01:58:11.259 --> 01:58:14.181]  We have to have it, and we've got great products you already need.
[01:58:14.301 --> 01:58:15.221]  I mean, take fish oil.
[01:58:15.281 --> 01:58:17.322]  What it does for your heart, your brain, energy.
[01:58:17.422 --> 01:58:19.023]  I don't even usually take a nootropic.
[01:58:19.163 --> 01:58:24.786]  If I'm up at 10 o'clock at night, and I gotta work till 3am on Coast to Coast AM or some show, I pop five fish oils.
[01:58:25.046 --> 01:58:26.588]  Nobody calls fish oil nootropic.
[01:58:27.108 --> 01:58:28.330]  Your brain's electrochemical.
[01:58:28.450 --> 01:58:30.692]  It's basically made out of what fish oil is.
[01:58:30.892 --> 01:58:32.254]  Fish oil is what floats my boat.
[01:58:33.195 --> 01:58:34.476]  I mean, I take it every morning right now.
[01:58:34.717 --> 01:58:36.138]  First thing I get up at 6 a.m.
[01:58:36.238 --> 01:58:39.362]  with my coffee, I bang back three big old fat juicy fish oils.
[01:58:39.722 --> 01:58:41.564]  And so, Arm Ultimate Krill Oil.
[01:58:41.784 --> 01:58:44.926]  It's even better than the fish oil, what it does for your brain, but there's no way to denature it.
[01:58:44.986 --> 01:58:48.047]  It gives you the burps, I'm not gonna lie to you, but if you can deal with it, it's it.
[01:58:48.067 --> 01:58:50.509]  The ultimate krill oil is rocket fuel, baby.
[01:58:50.649 --> 01:58:51.889]  I mean, it's the next level.
[01:58:52.009 --> 01:58:54.771]  Ultimate fish oil, all crafted out of the fjords, amazing.
[01:58:54.791 --> 01:58:57.152]  Doesn't give you the burpees, neither does honor roll.
[01:58:57.292 --> 01:58:59.994]  It's amazing for your kids, small caplets, but I tend to like honor roll.
[01:59:00.094 --> 01:59:01.915]  Okay, I'm a fish oil addict, I'm not gonna lie.
[01:59:02.055 --> 01:59:02.855]  I gobble the stuff.
[01:59:03.135 --> 01:59:04.296]  Coffee's a thing of the past now.
[01:59:04.916 --> 01:59:06.117]  Brain force is a thing of the past.
[01:59:06.317 --> 01:59:07.898]  And for different people, different things.
[01:59:08.757 --> 01:59:11.764]  I'm just telling you, fish oil is numero uno.
[01:59:12.365 --> 01:59:15.473]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslot.com, or AAA253-3139.
[01:59:23.027 --> 01:59:25.107]  It uses a medicinal herb of thousands of years.
[01:59:25.167 --> 01:59:27.768]  Turmeric is one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[01:59:28.148 --> 01:59:33.489]  It is there for the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support.
[01:59:33.729 --> 01:59:41.830]  And it's got the turmeric root extract, the Boswellia cerata extract, organic spearmint, sage, lemon balm, thyme leaves, and piperine from black pepper.
[01:59:42.190 --> 01:59:47.111]  It will help you take control of your body and feel the power of turmeric like never before.
[01:59:47.651 --> 01:59:50.952]  Right now at InfoWarsStore.com, please support this network.
[01:59:56.670 --> 02:00:00.332]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:00.352 --> 02:00:02.033]  You gave me fortune!
[02:00:02.093 --> 02:00:02.834]  You gave me fame!
[02:00:02.874 --> 02:00:04.715]  You gave me power!
[02:00:04.735 --> 02:00:07.897]  Give me your God's name!
[02:00:08.577 --> 02:00:18.444]  I'm every person you need to be!
[02:00:43.337 --> 02:00:45.959]  So, we spent a large part of the broadcast here.
[02:00:45.979 --> 02:00:47.500]  Fade that audio down, please.
[02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:56.186]  We spent a large portion of the broadcast here talking about Roger Stone and all the things that are going on here.
[02:00:57.267 --> 02:01:04.472]  But again, this is them caught red-handed lying to the public, saying they didn't stage the raid, saying they didn't involve CNN, and it's all right there, Roger.
[02:01:04.552 --> 02:01:11.137]  We've got some of the final clips coming up next segment, but it's just mind-boggling that this goes on and all the lying
[02:01:12.301 --> 02:01:16.853]  By this embedded group of criminals that the Clintons and others put in at the FBI.
[02:01:17.154 --> 02:01:19.099]  What a scourge of snot-nosed rats.
[02:01:19.801 --> 02:01:21.224]  And why is everyone so scared of them?
[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:31.024]  Well, in fact, the president just appointed a new number two at the FBI as the anti-terrorism chief, who is a deep state colleague of Robert Mueller.
[02:01:31.104 --> 02:01:32.965]  Mr. President, please wake up.
[02:01:33.365 --> 02:01:38.467]  Appoint somebody you actually know, somebody who is loyal to the goals of your administration.
[02:01:38.788 --> 02:01:42.970]  Stop appointing Clintonite, Bushite criminals to these positions.
[02:01:43.190 --> 02:01:44.690]  It is really extraordinary.
[02:01:45.211 --> 02:01:49.032]  So, look, Alex, as you know, they're trying to lock me away for 45 years.
[02:01:50.413 --> 02:01:57.359]  Which is what I would get if I am found guilty, potentially, of the things that I am not guilty of, that I have pled innocent to.
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:01:59.341]  This is a witch hunt.
[02:01:59.801 --> 02:02:02.323]  I am being targeted because I appear on InfoWars.
[02:02:02.864 --> 02:02:05.386]  I'm being targeted because I work with Alex Jones.
[02:02:05.906 --> 02:02:09.109]  I'm being targeted because I supported Donald Trump for president.
[02:02:09.609 --> 02:02:14.331]  I'm being targeted because I helped defeat the evil queen, Hillary Clinton.
[02:02:14.711 --> 02:02:19.713]  Because I wrote the Clinton's War on Women, which you can buy right now at the Infowars.com store.
[02:02:20.113 --> 02:02:26.896]  The definitive oppo breakdown on Bill and Hillary Clinton, available at the Infowars.com store at a great price.
[02:02:27.396 --> 02:02:32.078]  This chilling video shows red-handed that CNN is busted.
[02:02:32.158 --> 02:02:34.018]  That Sarah Murray is a liar.
[02:02:34.318 --> 02:02:39.260]  That Wolf Blitzer, who has the worst breath of anybody on television, by the way, is a liar.
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:40.680]  Not a journalist, a conman.
[02:02:40.941 --> 02:02:42.141]  Not a journalist, a huckster.
[02:02:42.461 --> 02:02:43.782]  Not a journalist, a liar.
[02:02:44.162 --> 02:02:45.904]  These people are beyond the pale.
[02:02:46.264 --> 02:02:48.506]  CNN is not a news organization.
[02:02:48.966 --> 02:02:56.471]  And they have worked hand in glove with the deep state to attempt to paint a picture of me as public enemy number one.
[02:02:56.792 --> 02:02:57.552]  This is a crime.
[02:02:58.313 --> 02:03:04.157]  The leak of an arrest, the leak of a warrant, the leak of an indictment is a crime.
[02:03:04.935 --> 02:03:07.317]  Sarah Murray is guilty of a crime.
[02:03:07.677 --> 02:03:09.658]  CNN is guilty of a crime.
[02:03:10.178 --> 02:03:14.201]  There are members of the Mueller Task Force who have committed a crime.
[02:03:14.461 --> 02:03:17.223]  Mr. Whitaker, do you believe in the rule of law?
[02:03:17.363 --> 02:03:18.904]  Are you afraid of these people?
[02:03:19.324 --> 02:03:21.205]  When will the President take action?
[02:03:21.325 --> 02:03:26.108]  We need a new special counsel who needs to target these globalist criminals.
[02:03:26.568 --> 02:03:28.349]  They're the ones who were in bed with Russia.
[02:03:28.729 --> 02:03:32.631]  They're the ones who took $145 million from the Russian energy company.
[02:03:32.991 --> 02:03:39.774]  They're the ones who schlepped the uranium samples to Stockholm for the Russians to inspect before they closed the deal.
[02:03:40.135 --> 02:03:40.895]  That's treason!
[02:03:41.644 --> 02:03:43.766]  The penalty for treason is execution.
[02:03:43.806 --> 02:03:45.008]  It's capital punishment.
[02:03:45.248 --> 02:03:47.210]  Hillary, my friends, is eligible.
[02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:51.314]  That is the largest treasonous crime in American history.
[02:03:51.655 --> 02:03:54.538]  Now you see the agents swarming my front door.
[02:03:54.918 --> 02:03:57.962]  You see two agents holding assault weapons.
[02:03:58.502 --> 02:04:01.684]  Shooting, aiming through the window.
[02:04:01.804 --> 02:04:02.844]  This is chilling.
[02:04:03.244 --> 02:04:04.445]  There's a side window there.
[02:04:04.465 --> 02:04:05.806]  You see he's looking in the window.
[02:04:06.266 --> 02:04:08.047]  I did not come down the stairs.
[02:04:08.487 --> 02:04:09.227]  He's listening.
[02:04:09.648 --> 02:04:12.469]  Now he pounds on the door, but he doesn't say anything.
[02:04:12.569 --> 02:04:13.870]  All I hear is a pounding.
[02:04:14.330 --> 02:04:17.531]  Now he pounds on the door again and yells FBI.
[02:04:18.312 --> 02:04:20.453]  I'm coming down the staircase.
[02:04:21.133 --> 02:04:22.034]  I open, I
[02:04:23.007 --> 02:04:25.848]  Open the door looking down the barrel of two assault weapons.
[02:04:26.268 --> 02:04:29.229]  You can see me putting my hands in the air because I don't want to be shot.
[02:04:29.589 --> 02:04:31.310]  Maybe it's a good thing CNN is there.
[02:04:32.170 --> 02:04:33.350]  Because I might have been shot.
[02:04:33.811 --> 02:04:35.691]  And you see them handcuff me.
[02:04:36.091 --> 02:04:40.973]  Yeah, because Mueller got put in by Bush and the Clintons and he's the president.
[02:04:41.153 --> 02:04:43.053]  I mean, they rule America.
[02:04:43.093 --> 02:04:44.254]  They're going to open the borders up.
[02:04:44.574 --> 02:04:46.034]  They're going to kill babies after they're born.
[02:04:46.795 --> 02:04:50.436]  And they're just going to wander around in their white shoe boy suits and do it all.
[02:04:51.448 --> 02:04:53.569]  And I guess we could never get to blurring the faces out.
[02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:54.829]  We're just gonna air it all coming up good.
[02:04:54.849 --> 02:04:55.689]  I don't give a damn anyways.
[02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:56.970]  Bunch of crap.
[02:04:57.050 --> 02:04:57.630]  Bunch of idiots.
[02:04:57.670 --> 02:05:00.991]  In all honesty, these people, some of them have to be prosecuted.
[02:05:01.151 --> 02:05:02.632]  Yeah, they need to be prosecuted.
[02:05:02.652 --> 02:05:05.873]  Stay with us.
[02:05:06.513 --> 02:05:09.494]  When we go off to war.
[02:05:10.074 --> 02:05:11.955]  When we exercise our rights.
[02:05:14.976 --> 02:05:17.077]  When we soar to our greatest heights.
[02:05:19.719 --> 02:05:23.561]  When we mourn and pray.
[02:05:23.741 --> 02:05:26.103]  When our neighbors are at risk.
[02:05:28.384 --> 02:05:30.345]  When our nation is threatened.
[02:05:32.366 --> 02:05:34.488]  There's someone to gather the facts.
[02:05:36.729 --> 02:05:37.770]  To bring you the story.
[02:05:40.491 --> 02:05:41.632]  No matter the cost.
[02:05:44.215 --> 02:05:47.680]  This is why so many people can't stand the mainstream media.
[02:05:48.201 --> 02:05:49.983]  Because knowing empowers us.
[02:05:51.766 --> 02:05:53.488]  Knowing helps us decide.
[02:05:55.131 --> 02:05:57.454]  Knowing keeps us free.
[02:06:15.493 --> 02:06:21.758]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:52.679 --> 02:07:03.543]  Roger Stone exclusively joins us and we're going to go through all this footage and be posting it to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as we go through it.
[02:07:04.543 --> 02:07:07.144]  But we'll show his wife being marched out in a moment.
[02:07:07.184 --> 02:07:14.766]  But I think overshadowing all of this, Roger, is that this is a political wet shot.
[02:07:14.846 --> 02:07:16.507]  You weren't indicted for any Russian collusion.
[02:07:18.067 --> 02:07:20.969]  And they've been caught lying to the press again.
[02:07:21.009 --> 02:07:22.170]  They've been caught lying to Congress.
[02:07:22.190 --> 02:07:25.312]  They've been caught lying to everybody about what they did.
[02:07:25.332 --> 02:07:28.894]  And I think this raid has really blown up in their face.
[02:07:28.974 --> 02:07:38.880]  But you can't overstate how big it is to have CNN on tape being directed by the FBI with the FBI and others saying they didn't even know CNN was there.
[02:07:40.031 --> 02:07:41.031]  Well, obviously they did.
[02:07:41.051 --> 02:07:44.833]  The camera's right there with the men all walking around it and talking to the reporter.
[02:07:45.494 --> 02:07:46.674]  They've just blocked off the streets.
[02:07:46.734 --> 02:07:47.755]  Yes, they staged this.
[02:07:47.795 --> 02:07:54.678]  So the arrogance to lie to the people, it just shows terminal level hubris or chutzpah.
[02:07:56.098 --> 02:08:01.481]  Well, Alex, this is the footage we just showed of my poor wife being perp walked out in the street.
[02:08:02.253 --> 02:08:04.674]  Hashtag Nydia Stone did nothing wrong.
[02:08:04.934 --> 02:08:06.354]  She's not accused of any crime.
[02:08:06.454 --> 02:08:07.995]  Why is she being abused like this?
[02:08:08.015 --> 02:08:09.295]  It breaks my heart.
[02:08:09.955 --> 02:08:12.596]  This is outrageous that this can happen in America.
[02:08:13.076 --> 02:08:15.657]  She and her family fled Fidel Castro's gulag.
[02:08:15.697 --> 02:08:16.357]  There she is.
[02:08:17.858 --> 02:08:20.078]  Why is she being manhandled?
[02:08:20.138 --> 02:08:21.519]  This makes no sense to me.
[02:08:22.539 --> 02:08:26.120]  It's hard for me to believe that this can actually happen in America.
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:28.222]  Mr. President, I hope you see this.
[02:08:28.582 --> 02:08:33.087]  There you see those courageous FBI agents putting tape over the cameras.
[02:08:33.147 --> 02:08:35.029]  Now the sun has come up.
[02:08:35.069 --> 02:08:36.791]  That's why we've switched to color.
[02:08:38.319 --> 02:08:41.882]  Senator Graham, please question that man with the beard.
[02:08:42.002 --> 02:08:45.024]  Find him and question him in front of your committee.
[02:08:45.424 --> 02:08:47.226]  Ask him who gave the orders for this.
[02:08:47.466 --> 02:08:48.206]  That's a cover-up.
[02:08:48.527 --> 02:08:50.528]  You see, they want to cover up their criminality.
[02:08:51.149 --> 02:08:52.790]  And they thought they took this tape.
[02:08:53.090 --> 02:08:55.152]  They didn't realize they left this tape behind.
[02:08:55.652 --> 02:08:58.555]  I turned this tape over to the House and Senate investigators.
[02:08:59.015 --> 02:09:00.616]  I did not leak it to Sinclair.
[02:09:00.836 --> 02:09:06.601]  But now that it's out there in a truncated version, Alex, I want to thank you for having the courage to show all of it.
[02:09:06.901 --> 02:09:12.284]  We're having the courage to show CNN colluding with the FBI in violation of the law.
[02:09:12.665 --> 02:09:14.626]  Somebody has to be prosecuted.
[02:09:15.046 --> 02:09:15.807]  Sarah Murray.
[02:09:16.027 --> 02:09:16.767]  S-A-R-A.
[02:09:16.847 --> 02:09:17.448]  Sarah Murray.
[02:09:17.468 --> 02:09:18.688]  You can find her on Instagram.
[02:09:18.969 --> 02:09:21.250]  You can find her on Facebook.
[02:09:21.930 --> 02:09:23.591]  She has not told the truth about this.
[02:09:23.912 --> 02:09:31.977]  Why was she calling me to ask me my home address the day before the raid if CNN now says that they've been staking out my house every Friday for months?
[02:09:32.337 --> 02:09:34.478]  But the security video shows that that's a lie.
[02:09:34.838 --> 02:09:35.619]  Josh Campbell.
[02:09:35.879 --> 02:09:41.403]  Former, now at CNN, former Special Assistant to FBI Director James Comey.
[02:09:41.463 --> 02:09:43.465]  What did he know and when did he know it?
[02:09:43.845 --> 02:09:46.287]  This is the most obvious setup I've ever seen.
[02:09:46.768 --> 02:09:51.972]  And right now, while we're showing this to you, ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN,
[02:09:52.592 --> 02:09:53.053]  Thank you.
[02:10:08.370 --> 02:10:17.533]  Alex, I want to thank you again for having the courage to show this because there aren't many journalistic outlets that would have this courage.
[02:10:17.914 --> 02:10:22.135]  You've had the cojones to take on the globalists for 25 years.
[02:10:22.195 --> 02:10:25.536]  Maybe this is why we are kindred spirits like you.
[02:10:25.556 --> 02:10:26.677]  I will never quit.
[02:10:26.997 --> 02:10:27.977]  I will never give up.
[02:10:28.077 --> 02:10:29.498]  But as I said earlier in the show,
[02:10:30.038 --> 02:10:38.602]  The survival of InfoWars as a viable media platform is essential to my survival and to my ultimate vindication.
[02:10:38.922 --> 02:10:46.425]  If I cannot come here on InfoWars and tell people the truth, then there is zero chance that I can survive.
[02:10:46.445 --> 02:10:53.188]  And let me assure you, if the judge survives, decides to gag me, I will have no choice but to adhere to the court's order.
[02:10:53.768 --> 02:10:55.048]  My daughter will speak out.
[02:10:55.368 --> 02:10:56.689]  My son will speak out.
[02:10:57.129 --> 02:10:58.650]  My wife will speak out.
[02:10:59.451 --> 02:11:03.213]  We will not have our First Amendments as a family abridged.
[02:11:03.553 --> 02:11:05.855]  They may try to abridge my First Amendment rights.
[02:11:06.215 --> 02:11:07.656]  The courts will address that.
[02:11:08.417 --> 02:11:21.225]  I obviously, because of judge shopping by the Mueller investigation, I'm in front of the same activist liberal judge who gagged Paul Manafort in violation of his First Amendment rights.
[02:11:21.525 --> 02:11:23.187]  I'm not going to talk about the case.
[02:11:23.247 --> 02:11:24.828]  I'm going to do that talking in court.
[02:11:25.088 --> 02:11:28.091]  But people need to understand this is a fixed deal.
[02:11:28.832 --> 02:11:31.434]  And the fact that I would go to trial in the District of Columbia.
[02:11:31.994 --> 02:11:32.695]  There you see it.
[02:11:33.496 --> 02:11:35.037]  Can this really happen in America?
[02:11:35.137 --> 02:11:36.398]  I'm 66 years old.
[02:11:36.799 --> 02:11:37.820]  I don't own a gun.
[02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:39.741]  I don't have a valid passport.
[02:11:40.082 --> 02:11:41.543]  I've destroyed no evidence.
[02:11:41.623 --> 02:11:45.607]  And I'm accused of a series of non-violent process crimes.
[02:11:46.147 --> 02:11:51.612]  Yet there are your tax dollars at work, opening the door, staring down the barrel of a gun.
[02:11:52.092 --> 02:11:54.614]  Yes, Senator Graham, the man with the beard.
[02:11:54.894 --> 02:11:55.595]  Question him.
[02:11:55.715 --> 02:11:57.016]  Who ordered him to do this?
[02:11:57.336 --> 02:11:57.997]  Let's find out.
[02:11:59.645 --> 02:12:00.566]  Roger, God bless you.
[02:12:00.606 --> 02:12:01.547]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:12:01.567 --> 02:12:02.928]  I guess that hearing's coming up tomorrow.
[02:12:02.948 --> 02:12:03.528]  We'll know more.
[02:12:03.548 --> 02:12:07.951]  I guess you'll be in the War Room coming up today and we'll have these clips more organized.
[02:12:08.132 --> 02:12:09.252]  Maybe, maybe by then.
[02:12:09.272 --> 02:12:12.055]  Because I have whole other clips we haven't even seen.
[02:12:12.095 --> 02:12:12.795]  We didn't plan.
[02:12:12.815 --> 02:12:14.216]  I'm not bitching.
[02:12:14.236 --> 02:12:16.878]  You just get all this footage and we're trying to figure out what to do with it.
[02:12:17.979 --> 02:12:42.725]  Um, so we're gonna have things more in an orderly format today, obviously, on The War Room, 3 to 6 p.m., so we can go over all of this and just, you know, have it all condensed down, like, here is the first time the CNN talks to the FBI, second time, third time, and then here's the raid, and, you know, here's the wife coming out, and then, you know, here's Attorney General Whitaker saying he's investigating him, because this is a really big deal.
[02:12:42.805 --> 02:12:43.665]  This is a big deal.
[02:12:44.878 --> 02:12:49.420]  They've said that they didn't give the warrant to CNN, even though they were dumb enough to send it to you and show they did.
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:50.501]  That's a felony.
[02:12:51.701 --> 02:12:54.322]  And they're just committing so many damn crimes.
[02:12:55.263 --> 02:13:02.986]  It just shows us what a horrible group of criminals that we've got inside our government, and then a bunch of yes-men that just do whatever they're told.
[02:13:03.486 --> 02:13:04.207]  So God bless you.
[02:13:04.227 --> 02:13:05.347]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[02:13:05.367 --> 02:13:06.828]  We'll talk to you very soon, Roger.
[02:13:07.728 --> 02:13:12.332]  Well, Alex, I think we may want to think about doing a special emergency broadcast this weekend.
[02:13:12.412 --> 02:13:17.696]  If I'm not gagged, I would be happy to join you because you have the courage to lay it out for the American people.
[02:13:18.116 --> 02:13:20.238]  You don't pull any punches and you tell the truth.
[02:13:20.618 --> 02:13:22.380]  That's why they're so desperate to gag you.
[02:13:22.420 --> 02:13:27.404]  Yes, folks, go to stonedefensefund.com and help me in this epic struggle.
[02:13:27.564 --> 02:13:30.266]  I'm looking at to raise $2 million to defend myself.
[02:13:30.286 --> 02:13:33.869]  And when you're finished there, go to the infowars.com store.
[02:13:34.169 --> 02:13:36.091]  By the way, Alex, I got to tell you this.
[02:13:37.066 --> 02:13:44.492]  Stacking Brain Force Plus and Turbo Force is the most incredible, energizing combination I've found.
[02:13:44.652 --> 02:13:45.873]  I'm working long days.
[02:13:46.553 --> 02:13:51.057]  I'm doing as much media as I can to tell people the truth and try to raise this money.
[02:13:51.377 --> 02:13:53.839]  And my energy has had such an incredible lift.
[02:13:54.339 --> 02:13:54.399]  Yes.
[02:14:15.179 --> 02:14:21.623]  Well, you know, when you have a laced energy drink stew like Red Bull, this gives you a subtle but deep, energizing feeling.
[02:14:21.983 --> 02:14:24.384]  It gives you real mental and physical focus.
[02:14:24.404 --> 02:14:27.526]  So I want to congratulate you for this incredible product.
[02:14:27.646 --> 02:14:32.449]  And I recommend taking it with brain force plus both of them available right now.
[02:14:37.371 --> 02:14:39.673]  Well, you do have more energy than usual.
[02:14:39.693 --> 02:14:40.534]  You have a lot of energy.
[02:14:41.255 --> 02:14:45.058]  Look, I know, we go out and we say, what is the best-selling formula out there for nootropic?
[02:14:45.639 --> 02:14:48.641]  Something similar to Brain Force, we just make it better and lower cost.
[02:14:49.162 --> 02:14:50.503]  What's the hottest market?
[02:14:50.523 --> 02:14:54.527]  Well, pre-workout or long-term energy stuff that doesn't give you a crash.
[02:14:54.827 --> 02:14:57.769]  Well, let's just take whatever the best formulas are and make it even better, lower the price.
[02:14:58.450 --> 02:14:59.210]  That's what we do.
[02:14:59.250 --> 02:15:02.732]  And again, the Brain Synergy Combo only has two reviews.
[02:15:02.792 --> 02:15:03.692]  That just went up.
[02:15:04.073 --> 02:15:08.715]  The bad guys always hit the reviews when they first go up and give fake reviews, but once there's time, they always do it.
[02:15:08.735 --> 02:15:11.536]  So let's show the review for Turbo Force by itself.
[02:15:12.156 --> 02:15:15.358]  Go there, you'll see the massive positive reviews.
[02:15:15.378 --> 02:15:18.359]  It's on the front page of m4warstore.com.
[02:15:18.439 --> 02:15:19.019]  That's where you go.
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:22.041]  And you can just click on, scroll down a little bit there for TV viewers.
[02:15:23.661 --> 02:15:24.761]  Scroll down a little bit.
[02:15:25.102 --> 02:15:26.622]  I speak from experience, Alex.
[02:15:26.682 --> 02:15:29.283]  This combination works better than anything I have tried.
[02:15:29.323 --> 02:15:32.584]  So there's a testimonial that's not rigged, that's not phony.
[02:15:32.904 --> 02:15:34.205]  Try this combination, folks.
[02:15:34.265 --> 02:15:36.406]  Turbo Force and Brain Force Plus.
[02:15:36.746 --> 02:15:38.346]  It is keeping me fighting 24 hours.
[02:15:38.386 --> 02:15:39.067]  Thank you, Roger.
[02:15:39.127 --> 02:15:43.488]  But what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to InfoWarshaw.com.
[02:15:43.588 --> 02:15:45.509]  I'm going to print the reviews for Turbo Force.
[02:15:46.428 --> 02:15:47.769]  I'm gonna read some of those when we come back.
[02:15:47.889 --> 02:15:52.293]  From Turbo Force by itself, that's been getting reviewed a few weeks.
[02:15:52.313 --> 02:15:52.774]  92% right there.
[02:15:53.474 --> 02:15:54.535]  A whole bunch of five stars.
[02:15:54.635 --> 02:15:55.216]  It's amazing.
[02:15:55.676 --> 02:16:00.020]  And it really pisses the left off that we have reviews at the third-party sites that can't stand it.
[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:00.901]  Thank you, Roger.
[02:16:02.362 --> 02:16:05.164]  Most of you know that it took us over a year to develop it.
[02:16:05.925 --> 02:16:07.907]  Thousands and thousands of five-star reviews.
[02:16:09.013 --> 02:16:09.994]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[02:16:10.294 --> 02:16:15.339]  I'm so proud of you and the InfoWars team for all that you do.
[02:16:15.439 --> 02:16:17.080]  I wanted to say I love your product.
[02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:19.602]  The Brain Force Plus is amazing.
[02:16:19.622 --> 02:16:24.887]  Me and my family take it every day and I mean you really can feel what it does.
[02:16:24.907 --> 02:16:33.134]  We were able to develop Brain Force because we went out and looked at what the best-selling nootropics or brain-focused energy products were.
[02:16:33.815 --> 02:16:35.596]  And we decided to make it even stronger
[02:16:36.557 --> 02:16:40.359]  And even more high quality and even more organic than leading competitors.
[02:16:40.899 --> 02:16:42.460]  And we've done it with BrainForce+.
[02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:46.962]  It is our number one bestseller in gross bottles sold.
[02:16:47.882 --> 02:16:52.284]  Now I made the decision in our marketing to put a lot of product in it and sell it for a low price.
[02:16:52.905 --> 02:16:55.026]  Believing that you're smart, you'll research the market.
[02:16:55.626 --> 02:17:00.290]  Get a great result, know you're getting a great deal, and be routine, continued customers.
[02:17:00.710 --> 02:17:04.253]  I want a long-term relationship with you, and I want a product that I'm proud of that I'm going to use.
[02:17:04.674 --> 02:17:05.895]  It's up there as the very best.
[02:17:06.235 --> 02:17:10.338]  There are nootropics that are $80 a bottle that aren't as good, that have some of the similar ingredients.
[02:17:10.999 --> 02:17:13.961]  But, you know, a doctor sells it at their office, so it must be better.
[02:17:15.102 --> 02:17:21.708]  Ladies and gentlemen, we then stood back and said, what is the number one best-selling thing in the total market globally?
[02:17:22.705 --> 02:17:22.885]  I don't
[02:17:43.169 --> 02:17:49.232]  Top people in the country who has developed some of the other top energy drinks in the nation and in the world.
[02:17:49.632 --> 02:17:53.414]  And they developed TurboForce that is the next level.
[02:17:53.934 --> 02:17:54.895]  Long burn.
[02:17:54.915 --> 02:17:57.096]  A lot of folks up to 10 hours of energy.
[02:17:57.176 --> 02:17:58.216]  Me, 6, 7, 8 hours.
[02:17:58.596 --> 02:18:00.137]  And I take about a half a pack and it's so strong.
[02:18:00.477 --> 02:18:06.060]  And then it's got all the minerals and all the different amino acids that help deliver the energy into the body.
[02:18:06.823 --> 02:18:20.645]  And that's why I want to thank all the listeners who've been BrainForce fans with 50% off BrainForce, because the two go together, to supply yourself and your family with your nootropic, with TurboForce, ladies and gentlemen, so you can try it.
[02:18:21.025 --> 02:18:27.847]  It's 33% off, and you get it in a combo, 50% off on BrainForce, for a limited time, at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:18:28.327 --> 02:18:30.927]  One is a pill, one is a packet.
[02:18:31.427 --> 02:18:35.748]  And again, the first time you take TurboForce, I recommend you only take half a packet, because let me tell you,
[02:18:36.761 --> 02:18:40.186]  Folks I know that are totally into energy drinks said they've never seen anything like it.
[02:18:40.546 --> 02:18:42.088]  Most energy drinks hit in 20-30 minutes.
[02:18:42.108 --> 02:18:46.234]  A lot of people get hit in 5 minutes with turbo force.
[02:18:46.695 --> 02:18:51.641]  But again, it doesn't just hit fast, it lasts super, super long because the developers
[02:18:52.742 --> 02:19:00.526]  That we reached out to had the mission of having something that gives you continual clean energy over a long period of time.
[02:19:00.866 --> 02:19:06.068]  So the different compounds that are in this, that synergistically work together, have different burn rates.
[02:19:06.628 --> 02:19:09.990]  Almost like a Saturn rocket's got three different components.
[02:19:11.514 --> 02:19:11.935]  See what I mean?
[02:19:12.215 --> 02:19:20.167]  It launches, you get the main boost phase, then you get up into orbit, you got your next phase, you get to the moon, land on the moon, come back to the Earth.
[02:19:20.547 --> 02:19:24.333]  You've got all those different phases here, ladies and gentlemen, to get you throughout the day.
[02:19:24.773 --> 02:19:25.594]  Boost in the morning!
[02:19:26.533 --> 02:19:31.754]  Continue on through your interstellar day, conquering, exploring, dominating.
[02:19:32.434 --> 02:19:34.595]  And listen, I like to ride my horse and shoot my gun.
[02:19:34.715 --> 02:19:37.596]  You know, a country boy's work is really never done.
[02:19:38.036 --> 02:19:45.237]  And after you put the kids down to bed with the missus there in your arms, you can do a repair job and fix the cable like all good Americans do.
[02:19:45.777 --> 02:19:46.878]  And all thanks to Turbo Force.
[02:19:47.478 --> 02:19:52.059]  So again, coming to you, ladies and gentlemen, from the founding system,
[02:19:52.839 --> 02:19:57.081]  Of turbo force and brain force, I bring you this incredible product, the InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:19:57.321 --> 02:19:58.801]  Get the energy combo today.
[02:19:59.081 --> 02:20:00.642]  Oh, and fund the InfoWars and change the world.
[02:20:00.822 --> 02:20:01.662]  I forgot about that part too.
[02:20:06.404 --> 02:20:09.025]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:25.117 --> 02:20:28.860]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[02:20:29.180 --> 02:20:33.463]  Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:33.483 --> 02:20:38.287]  Of course it does not, Congressman.
[02:20:38.307 --> 02:20:38.787]  I know that.
[02:20:38.807 --> 02:20:40.809]  Right, because Paul Manafort was indicted.
[02:20:41.769 --> 02:20:46.133]  There is no sentence in the Constitution that says the President's children can't be indicted, correct?
[02:20:47.375 --> 02:20:50.659]  Congressman, you can give me the whole list.
[02:20:50.779 --> 02:20:54.204]  No, I'll give you three more.
[02:20:54.444 --> 02:21:00.872]  There is no sentence in the United States Constitution that says that the President's children cannot be indicted.
[02:21:00.892 --> 02:21:02.414]  There's no sentence in the U.S.
[02:21:02.434 --> 02:21:05.098]  Constitution that says the Vice President can't be indicted, correct?
[02:21:06.909 --> 02:21:07.489]  That's correct.
[02:21:08.109 --> 02:21:09.450]  There's no sentence in the U.S.
[02:21:09.470 --> 02:21:10.150]  Constitution.
[02:21:10.430 --> 02:21:11.331]  This is my last one.
[02:21:11.711 --> 02:21:12.931]  There's no sentence in the U.S.
[02:21:12.971 --> 02:21:16.873]  Constitution that says the sitting President of the United States cannot be indicted.
[02:21:17.113 --> 02:21:17.473]  Correct?
[02:21:17.553 --> 02:21:22.395]  Congressman, because that is the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel to the Department of Justice.
[02:21:22.415 --> 02:21:23.615]  I don't actually care what DOJ policy is.
[02:21:23.635 --> 02:21:25.076]  I'm asking about the Constitution.
[02:21:25.096 --> 02:21:27.597]  It's been consistent with the practices of the Department of Justice for years.
[02:21:27.617 --> 02:21:29.237]  Mr. Whitaker, it's just a yes or no question.
[02:21:29.257 --> 02:21:30.458]  Mr. Whitaker, I'm asking a factual question.
[02:21:30.478 --> 02:21:31.398]  Under both administrations.
[02:21:31.918 --> 02:21:36.203]  After this hearing, you can spin the Constitution all you want as you sit here today.
[02:21:36.243 --> 02:21:38.986]  You just have to answer a factual yes or no question.
[02:21:39.006 --> 02:21:40.428]  I'm going to make it even easier for you.
[02:21:41.008 --> 02:21:47.215]  There's no sentence in the Constitution that says, quote, the sitting President of the United States cannot be indicted, unquote.
[02:21:47.736 --> 02:21:48.156]  Correct?
[02:21:49.437 --> 02:21:50.038]  Yes or no?
[02:21:51.239 --> 02:21:53.140]  I have it right here.
[02:21:53.481 --> 02:21:55.822]  I have a copy of myself.
[02:21:55.962 --> 02:21:57.603]  So is that sentence in this constitution?
[02:21:57.904 --> 02:21:58.864]  It's not, correct?
[02:21:59.404 --> 02:22:00.365]  I'm not trying to trick you.
[02:22:00.425 --> 02:22:01.426]  It's not a hard question.
[02:22:01.726 --> 02:22:04.608]  It's a founding document of a federal government.
[02:22:04.728 --> 02:22:06.429]  Is that sentence in this constitution?
[02:22:06.949 --> 02:22:08.730]  Congressman, you and I both know
[02:22:09.631 --> 02:22:11.072]  Let's stop right there.
[02:22:11.132 --> 02:22:12.233]  I wanted to play that clip.
[02:22:12.253 --> 02:22:13.073]  That happened about 15 minutes ago.
[02:22:13.093 --> 02:22:14.935]  I was just in the break room during the break.
[02:22:34.949 --> 02:22:36.450]  Getting a cup of coffee.
[02:22:37.311 --> 02:22:42.435]  And they had another congresswoman literally saying, Trump is hurting children on the border.
[02:22:42.455 --> 02:22:43.435]  We must end the border.
[02:22:44.096 --> 02:22:47.678]  When these are smugglers, who knows, just showing up with kids and they admit that.
[02:22:48.599 --> 02:22:51.361]  This is the assault on the very nature and the existence of our country.
[02:22:51.701 --> 02:22:57.005]  I appreciate Trends Forecaster, a good friend of mine, Gerald Salente, joining us to talk about all of this.
[02:22:57.025 --> 02:23:00.087]  And he's got a raft of big issues he's going to get into.
[02:23:01.684 --> 02:23:10.403]  First off, I don't normally hype, hype, hype, but I know when something's so big that it's not going to get attention, I'm going to try to fight it getting attention.
[02:23:11.966 --> 02:23:24.313]  And that was three different clips of the CNN reporters showing up with the FBI, being directed by the FBI, when the FBI denied all of this, and when they've been caught lying.
[02:23:24.493 --> 02:23:29.616]  Gerald at TrendsResearch.com, for me, this is just a huge issue.
[02:23:30.236 --> 02:23:32.077]  Because Sinclair got a little clip of this.
[02:23:32.157 --> 02:23:35.379]  Roger wasn't going to release it until the government leaked it.
[02:23:36.536 --> 02:23:37.678]  He's not sure who linked it.
[02:23:38.099 --> 02:23:39.000]  He had copies.
[02:23:39.621 --> 02:23:40.984]  So he overnighted it to us.
[02:23:41.004 --> 02:23:41.865]  We've been working on it.
[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:45.401]  We tried to blur faces out in the wrong file plate.
[02:23:45.461 --> 02:23:49.903]  I mean, just like the government screwed up and didn't find the DVR to hide this.
[02:23:50.363 --> 02:23:54.805]  We've got a great crew, but it's like when something's in a rush, it's like this, like gremlins invade.
[02:23:54.865 --> 02:23:55.725]  It's like Laurel and Hardy.
[02:23:55.745 --> 02:23:57.046]  I thought I had the footage the first hour.
[02:23:57.446 --> 02:24:01.487]  We didn't get it till, you know, the end of the second, then it train wrecked.
[02:24:02.048 --> 02:24:08.390]  Which is fine, whatever the point is, is that this is crazy that they're in public, they're doing this, it's illegal and lawful.
[02:24:08.410 --> 02:24:09.651]  I just don't want to show their faces.
[02:24:10.171 --> 02:24:12.633]  At the same time, they've been caught lying.
[02:24:13.014 --> 02:24:14.495]  The higher-ups have done this.
[02:24:15.015 --> 02:24:19.980]  To me, it's just sensational how this illustrates CNN in collusion with Mueller.
[02:24:21.561 --> 02:24:29.628]  I watched the video on InfoWars, and it was quite disgusting on a number of levels.
[02:24:30.649 --> 02:24:37.315]  One of them, as you point out, letting the prostitutes know what's going to be going on before they even
[02:24:38.726 --> 02:24:42.428]  Inform his attorneys and treating him like a criminal.
[02:24:43.009 --> 02:24:59.960]  And I'm thinking about all these boys and girls dressed up in their military drag playing tough guys and tough women with all these weapons that they're carrying and all the body armor to go arrest a guy like that.
[02:25:00.825 --> 02:25:03.506]  And America talks about other countries.
[02:25:03.946 --> 02:25:06.628]  Could you imagine if this happened in Russia?
[02:25:07.268 --> 02:25:13.851]  If the Russians did that to somebody that was speaking out in favor of someone they dislike?
[02:25:13.871 --> 02:25:15.091]  Look what Putin does to the press!
[02:25:17.092 --> 02:25:27.757]  Yeah, again, could you imagine if the Russians did that, and we saw a clip, and then Roger, you know, outside with handcuffs behind him?
[02:25:28.377 --> 02:25:29.598]  Like he's a criminal?
[02:25:30.439 --> 02:25:37.142]  So again, what kind of people would execute this kind of phony order?
[02:25:37.962 --> 02:25:40.463]  And that's our FBI?
[02:25:41.144 --> 02:25:42.604]  So how low can you go?
[02:25:42.624 --> 02:25:44.305]  Well, they showed you.
[02:25:45.236 --> 02:25:54.300]  And the other point I want to make, just listening to that clip that you were playing, I don't know what arrogant little jerk Congress boy that was talking.
[02:25:54.780 --> 02:25:57.402]  Is this line in the Constitution?
[02:25:57.762 --> 02:25:59.523]  Is this line in the Constitution?
[02:25:59.943 --> 02:26:04.425]  A. A lot of lines aren't in the Constitution.
[02:26:05.182 --> 02:26:09.586]  Does the Constitution say that we got a bunch of morons running the government?
[02:26:09.606 --> 02:26:10.706]  We should get them out of there?
[02:26:10.967 --> 02:26:12.068]  No, that's not in there.
[02:26:12.548 --> 02:26:18.473]  What kind of questioning is that to say, is this line in the Constitution?
[02:26:19.333 --> 02:26:21.855]  It could be any line you could put in there.
[02:26:22.036 --> 02:26:23.477]  How stupid they are!
[02:26:23.977 --> 02:26:28.301]  And all of this is, and again, I got my problems with Trump.
[02:26:28.461 --> 02:26:30.402]  One of them is what's going on with Venezuela.
[02:26:31.755 --> 02:26:37.900]  That's all this has been since the beginning of this election is the overthrow of Trump.
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:27:01.157]  And that's all they're wasting America's time, money and energy on rather than putting it into a positive way and victimizing someone like Roger Stone in a video that clearly shows the military aspects of our so-called protect the police that are supposed to protect us.
[02:27:04.508 --> 02:27:14.194]  And, you know, I agree with you because I've read what you said about we don't want to take over Venezuela because then we own that problem, but their border's collapsing and Russia and China are trying to manipulate.
[02:27:14.634 --> 02:27:16.896]  So what do you think Trump does about Venezuela?
[02:27:17.876 --> 02:27:25.141]  You mind your own business because every, every, every, every, every foreign entanglement that we have gotten into
[02:27:25.839 --> 02:27:27.621]  Look what they have created.
[02:27:28.002 --> 02:27:30.665]  Great job over there in Afghanistan.
[02:27:31.106 --> 02:27:33.949]  Oh, wonderful, wonderful over there in Iraq.
[02:27:34.210 --> 02:27:35.772]  We're bringing democracy.
[02:27:36.032 --> 02:27:37.354]  Hey, how about Libya?
[02:27:37.694 --> 02:27:41.379]  Democracy destroyed the richest country in the region.
[02:27:42.006 --> 02:27:43.546]  Oh, how about Syria?
[02:27:43.807 --> 02:27:45.067]  Assad has to go.
[02:27:45.147 --> 02:27:46.727]  We don't like what that guy's doing.
[02:27:47.027 --> 02:27:48.908]  We're going to bring in democracy.
[02:27:49.228 --> 02:27:50.628]  Hey, how about Nicaragua?
[02:27:50.868 --> 02:27:52.289]  Want to go to Honduras?
[02:27:53.589 --> 02:28:01.851]  If we go into Venezuela, they've already had about 3 million people leave the country over the last, you know, three years.
[02:28:02.372 --> 02:28:10.934]  And you could also thank Obama's sanctions going back before that that have put pressure... Economic sanctions are warfare against the people.
[02:28:11.468 --> 02:28:20.391]  What, are they bringing in a guy like Elliot Abrams, a convicted war criminal, to be the head of bringing democracy there?
[02:28:20.711 --> 02:28:30.454]  This is the guy that was championing what they were doing back in the day with the Iran Conscious scandals and other supporters of people, of dictators in that area.
[02:28:30.855 --> 02:28:34.456]  No, America only, we... Mind your own business.
[02:28:34.556 --> 02:28:35.136]  Stay home.
[02:28:36.940 --> 02:28:49.043]  We'll be right back with Gerald Cilente to get more into where he sees things are going with Trump, and another clip I just saw during these hearings, where they're acting like if we stop anybody at the border, it's mass murder, but they don't care about killing babies after they're born.
[02:28:49.383 --> 02:28:50.843]  That's the new Democrat policy.
[02:28:51.183 --> 02:28:53.904]  We'll cover it all with Gerald Cilente from Trends Research.
[02:28:53.964 --> 02:28:57.624]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:28:57.944 --> 02:28:59.545]  His site's TrendsResearch.com.
[02:28:59.865 --> 02:29:00.545]  Spread those links.
[02:29:08.527 --> 02:29:09.828]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jessica.
[02:29:09.848 --> 02:29:11.410]  She wants to talk about the Virginia governor.
[02:29:11.911 --> 02:29:12.811]  Jessica, you're on the air.
[02:29:12.831 --> 02:29:14.613]  Looks like he'll be resigning soon.
[02:29:14.653 --> 02:29:15.074]  What do you think?
[02:29:15.654 --> 02:29:16.495]  I hope so.
[02:29:17.276 --> 02:29:18.958]  I never liked him from the beginning.
[02:29:19.178 --> 02:29:26.986]  I remember that President Obama endorsed him, and that was a big... I thought that would be a big wake-up call to people, but apparently it wasn't.
[02:29:27.486 --> 02:29:29.647]  But we keep the babies comfortable.
[02:29:29.667 --> 02:29:34.590]  I can't really do his fake southern accent, but it's just, I love southerners, you know, I'm from Texas, kind of southern.
[02:29:34.670 --> 02:29:42.075]  But it's like the fakeness of that sicky sweet, let's stay out of the ladies area, kill that baby.
[02:29:42.255 --> 02:29:48.038]  I think because he's a pediatrician, he's used to people, you know, kind of responding to that voice he does.
[02:29:48.119 --> 02:29:52.861]  But it sickens me that he's a pediatrician and he's pushing what he's pushing.
[02:29:52.901 --> 02:29:55.503]  But we're going to make the baby comfortable.
[02:29:56.043 --> 02:29:57.624]  Oh my gosh, it's so sickening.
[02:29:57.704 --> 02:30:00.346]  Well, we know in end times, this is the stuff that happens.
[02:30:00.386 --> 02:30:05.410]  That's why I'm so proud of you and the InfoWorks team for all that you do.
[02:30:05.610 --> 02:30:07.931]  And I love, I wanted to say I love your product.
[02:30:08.172 --> 02:30:11.354]  I have X2 and the Selenium for my thyroid.
[02:30:11.434 --> 02:30:13.395]  And I have to say those worked wonders.
[02:30:13.475 --> 02:30:15.817]  The Brain Force Plus is amazing.
[02:30:16.157 --> 02:30:17.678]  Me and my family take it every day.
[02:30:17.758 --> 02:30:20.460]  And I mean, you really can feel what it does.
[02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:25.782]  And usually I get a lot of brain fog from the thyroid issue and that helps tremendously.
[02:30:25.822 --> 02:30:27.843]  And the knockout helps me sleep at night.
[02:30:27.863 --> 02:30:33.066]  Especially when I have something important I have to get up and do in the morning and I don't feel that groggy feeling.
[02:30:33.146 --> 02:30:34.386]  And we use the toothpaste.
[02:30:34.426 --> 02:30:35.627]  We love the toothpaste.
[02:30:35.707 --> 02:30:39.368]  My son uses the krill oil for some issues that he deals with.
[02:30:39.408 --> 02:30:41.950]  My husband is a hardwood floor installer.
[02:30:42.030 --> 02:30:45.251]  He loves the bodies and he loves the Red Pill Plus.
[02:30:45.351 --> 02:30:47.212]  And we're going to try the Turbo Force next.
[02:30:47.933 --> 02:30:55.259]  Well, Jessie, I appreciate your support, but let me be honest with you.
[02:30:55.299 --> 02:30:56.660]  Only take a half pack at the first time.
[02:30:56.780 --> 02:30:58.761]  It's just, it's kind of like good crack.
[02:30:58.882 --> 02:31:00.983]  So, I'm almost embarrassed.
[02:31:01.324 --> 02:31:02.525]  Everybody should be careful with it.
[02:31:02.965 --> 02:31:03.665]  It's the next level.
[02:31:03.726 --> 02:31:04.166]  It's insane.
[02:31:04.326 --> 02:31:10.694]  I really am glad that I'm able to help the fight for truth and freedom and liberty.
[02:31:10.915 --> 02:31:18.545]  And I don't know where I would be and what I would think if I didn't have people like you on air who have just stayed strong through it all.
[02:31:18.585 --> 02:31:20.688]  So I just want to encourage you just to keep going.
[02:31:20.828 --> 02:31:24.009]  Keep fighting for us and with us because I don't know.
[02:31:24.029 --> 02:31:25.349]  I don't know what we would do.
[02:31:25.389 --> 02:31:26.470]  We wouldn't have anybody.
[02:31:26.490 --> 02:31:30.531]  If there wasn't you, I mean, I don't know that anybody else would be on the air doing it.
[02:31:30.691 --> 02:31:37.473]  Like you said, you're the tip of the spear, so I really appreciate you and what you say, you know, helps me stay connected to the truth.
[02:31:37.553 --> 02:31:47.156]  It helps me to stay connected to God, and I can't say enough about how much I love InfoWars, how much I love the products, but I would like to have some female cut shirts.
[02:31:48.357 --> 02:31:50.259]  No, no, I totally agree.
[02:31:51.100 --> 02:31:55.085]  We put out the one gold foil female shirt that was a big hit, and we're just brain dead.
[02:31:55.105 --> 02:31:57.568]  But I promise, that's our number one complaint, is from women.
[02:31:57.588 --> 02:31:59.510]  We've only got a couple shirts that are cut for females.
[02:31:59.570 --> 02:32:00.551]  We will get it done for you.
[02:32:00.571 --> 02:32:05.858]  But Jessica, you give me strength to go on, and your husband, and your family, because just hearing what's in your voice, the
[02:32:06.138 --> 02:32:09.341]  The powerful feminine energy and then the male energy together.
[02:32:09.561 --> 02:32:18.129]  All of us focused together against the globalists is unstoppable, and that's why they're attacking a sacred system of the family, of all of us together.
[02:32:18.409 --> 02:32:19.330]  We are humanity.
[02:32:19.630 --> 02:32:20.611]  We are the experience.
[02:32:20.631 --> 02:32:21.391]  We are everything.
[02:32:21.812 --> 02:32:25.915]  And so you just got my commitment to fight on, but let me tell you, I'm obnoxious most of the time.
[02:32:25.956 --> 02:32:26.496]  I'm burnt out.
[02:32:26.856 --> 02:32:28.818]  Hearing you, I don't want to just say this.
[02:32:28.938 --> 02:32:29.659]  I'm not just telling you this.
[02:32:30.159 --> 02:32:31.260]  You are the info war.
[02:32:31.380 --> 02:32:32.661]  You're the power of the whole thing.
[02:32:33.642 --> 02:32:37.503]  And that's why I get so freaked out about begging the audience for help, because it's the truth!
[02:32:37.603 --> 02:32:38.703]  I mean, I'm not just saying it.
[02:32:38.803 --> 02:32:42.324]  If you weren't here, standing in the way, they would have already destroyed me.
[02:32:42.544 --> 02:32:43.724]  But we're in this together.
[02:32:43.744 --> 02:32:45.565]  So God bless you, Jessica from Virginia.
[02:32:46.125 --> 02:32:48.966]  And yeah, looking at that little pathetic gremlin governor.
[02:32:49.126 --> 02:32:50.526]  Of course he's KKK.
[02:32:50.666 --> 02:32:52.787]  Who the hell wants to harvest babies' organs?
[02:32:52.827 --> 02:32:54.247]  That's what that's all really about.
[02:32:54.707 --> 02:32:55.907]  These are demons.
[02:32:56.427 --> 02:32:57.908]  But thanks to you and others, we're going to win.
[02:32:57.988 --> 02:32:58.648]  Thank you so much.
[02:33:06.318 --> 02:33:10.400]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:23.725 --> 02:33:29.927]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:32.844 --> 02:33:34.285]  We're going back to Gerald Cilente in a moment.
[02:33:34.305 --> 02:33:43.172]  I want to get his take on this before we look at the 2020 field and the economy and Trump trying to pull troops out of Afghanistan and Syria and being demonized and attacked.
[02:33:43.212 --> 02:33:49.557]  Where he sees the big nationalist movements, populist movements going, the Yellow Vests, so much more with Gerald Cilente in a moment.
[02:33:49.577 --> 02:33:52.520]  But here is Congresswoman Jayapal.
[02:33:54.039 --> 02:33:55.740]  From just minutes ago, I told you about it.
[02:33:56.260 --> 02:33:57.141]  How dare you?
[02:33:57.181 --> 02:33:59.062]  Your children are crying!
[02:33:59.983 --> 02:34:05.426]  Meanwhile, people show up, like 7 or 8 adults, 20 kids, no one knows who's who, they have no ID.
[02:34:06.127 --> 02:34:10.550]  It was the ACLU sued back under Bush, like 15 years ago.
[02:34:12.293 --> 02:34:18.396]  And said you've got to separate kids from adults and they just lie about this and say it's Trump and we've made conditions better.
[02:34:19.296 --> 02:34:25.158]  And even the Senate report said a lot of kids going to sex slavery who weren't checked and she just sits here in this big act.
[02:34:26.059 --> 02:34:30.581]  Well the Democrats won't stand when Trump says let's not abort babies after they're born.
[02:34:32.121 --> 02:34:37.384]  So beyond pro-life pro-choice I mean that's where we've gotten they can't have the cake and eat it too.
[02:34:37.744 --> 02:34:38.264]  So here it is.
[02:34:41.878 --> 02:34:46.480]  Our country is still reeling from the horrors of family separation that occurred at the border.
[02:34:47.061 --> 02:34:53.364]  I was the first member of Congress to talk to hundreds of women and men who had been ripped apart.
[02:34:53.504 --> 02:34:55.705]  Hundreds of thousands killed in Mexico.
[02:34:56.286 --> 02:34:58.347]  Federal prison to talk to those women.
[02:34:58.807 --> 02:35:02.209]  Many of them had not... This woman would end our civilization if she could.
[02:35:02.549 --> 02:35:06.790]  They sat in the room next door as they heard their children yelling for them.
[02:35:07.391 --> 02:35:10.071]  And they were not able to go and speak to their children.
[02:35:10.291 --> 02:35:11.032]  God, these people are sick.
[02:35:11.052 --> 02:35:13.312]  And for weeks they didn't know where their children were.
[02:35:15.393 --> 02:35:18.754]  I... Shouldn't have let them across the desert with no ID.
[02:35:18.914 --> 02:35:28.997]  I mean, these people commit these huge crimes and the left bitches and complains and gets in our face and tries to make us guilty and they're just a group of child trafficking monsters.
[02:35:30.578 --> 02:35:31.338]  Let's continue.
[02:35:33.183 --> 02:35:36.306]  These women, most of the men, were seeking asylum.
[02:35:36.886 --> 02:35:47.956]  And your department, instead of allowing them their legal right to seek asylum, your department instead imposed a zero-humanity policy to prosecute... Pause again.
[02:35:48.376 --> 02:35:49.537]  The UN broke Europe.
[02:35:49.557 --> 02:35:52.240]  They're breaking us, organizing millions to invade.
[02:35:52.260 --> 02:35:53.821]  They're almost all military-age men.
[02:35:53.841 --> 02:35:55.102]  They use a few kids as shields.
[02:35:55.503 --> 02:35:57.665]  They meant to overwhelm the judges and collapse the country.
[02:35:57.905 --> 02:35:58.846]  This is the plan!
[02:36:00.066 --> 02:36:01.227]  And this woman knows it!
[02:36:01.887 --> 02:36:02.467]  Let's continue.
[02:36:02.487 --> 02:36:03.308]  We'll get Gerald's take.
[02:36:03.348 --> 02:36:03.628]  Go ahead.
[02:36:05.709 --> 02:36:07.290]  Proceedings resulting in the U.S.
[02:36:07.310 --> 02:36:10.851]  government tearing thousands of children from their moms and dads.
[02:36:11.172 --> 02:36:12.412]  And this is still happening.
[02:36:12.432 --> 02:36:16.454]  And the truth is, we may not know how many children were separated from their parents.
[02:36:17.355 --> 02:36:23.398]  So, Mr. Whitaker, you were Attorney General, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Chief of Staff at the time.
[02:36:23.438 --> 02:36:23.918]  Is that correct?
[02:36:25.367 --> 02:36:27.812]  Of the zero tolerance policy being implemented?
[02:36:27.932 --> 02:36:30.037]  You were his chief of staff at the time.
[02:36:30.077 --> 02:36:30.999]  At what point in time?
[02:36:31.279 --> 02:36:32.702]  At the family separation policy.
[02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:34.231]  Let me just tell you, you were.
[02:36:34.271 --> 02:36:36.252]  I'm sorry, there was no family separation policy.
[02:36:36.272 --> 02:36:38.414]  There was a tolerance policy.
[02:36:38.734 --> 02:36:41.617]  This has been given four Pinocchios multiple times.
[02:36:41.957 --> 02:36:45.220]  I'm just going to tell you, you were former Attorney General's Chief of Staff at the time.
[02:36:45.620 --> 02:36:47.722]  Last month, Senator Merkley released... Hit pause again.
[02:36:47.742 --> 02:36:48.642]  I'm going to go to Joel on this.
[02:36:49.423 --> 02:36:53.426]  They have this thing where, oh, Snopes or one of our paid groups says you're a Pinocchio.
[02:36:53.466 --> 02:36:54.908]  Like, whatever it goes, the sky's blue.
[02:36:55.328 --> 02:36:56.269]  They go, no it's not!
[02:36:56.709 --> 02:36:58.571]  We have a group that says four Pinocchios!
[02:37:00.930 --> 02:37:05.611]  Then go move to Mexico or Venezuela, you dumb, ignorant blob!
[02:37:06.591 --> 02:37:14.052]  Stop coming here and just bitching that we're the most open country in the world and trying to shame us because you want to use our Christian ethos against it, you ugly witch!
[02:37:14.613 --> 02:37:15.153]  Go back to her.
[02:37:17.413 --> 02:37:24.334]  By senior officials at the Department of Justice and Homeland Security outlining policies to separate children from their families.
[02:37:24.514 --> 02:37:26.295]  Were you aware of this memo at the time?
[02:37:27.455 --> 02:37:27.595]  No.
[02:37:28.860 --> 02:37:34.044]  So as the Chief of Staff, you were not aware of what your boss was doing.
[02:37:36.566 --> 02:37:41.310]  Was the memo, I'm sorry, are you talking about the leaked memo or the memo that General Sessions issued?
[02:37:41.530 --> 02:37:46.014]  There was a leaked draft memo by senior officials at the Department of Justice.
[02:37:46.034 --> 02:37:47.135]  You were the Chief of Staff.
[02:37:47.175 --> 02:37:51.078]  I would think you would know, and you would be a senior official, you would know about that memo.
[02:37:51.358 --> 02:37:52.419]  The memo stated
[02:37:52.819 --> 02:38:04.709]  That a policy of criminally prosecuting parents would require close coordination between DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services, which would be tasked with housing children separated from their moms and dads.
[02:38:05.029 --> 02:38:15.357]  And yet, a report released by the Government Accountability Office last October says that DHS and HHS were, quote, unaware that your... That's enough of her.
[02:38:15.518 --> 02:38:17.619]  So, again, just we have a totally open border.
[02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:18.740]  Do whatever you want.
[02:38:18.780 --> 02:38:19.521]  This is a total joke.
[02:38:20.441 --> 02:38:21.642]  And Gerald, I appreciate you joining us.
[02:38:21.662 --> 02:38:23.283]  You got a lot to cover when we come back next segment.
[02:38:23.303 --> 02:38:25.764]  But just on this whole subject, what do you make of this?
[02:38:26.824 --> 02:38:33.087]  Well, again, you know, we one of our top trends for 2019 is human waves.
[02:38:33.768 --> 02:38:47.514]  And you're looking at Latin America for Central America over, according to a Gallup poll survey, nearly 27 percent of the people want to leave those regions because of the violence, the corruption.
[02:38:48.328 --> 02:38:50.490]  And the inability to get any jobs.
[02:38:50.970 --> 02:38:52.151]  So, let's go back.
[02:38:52.211 --> 02:38:52.992]  How to stop it?
[02:38:53.612 --> 02:39:00.378]  Number one, it goes back to Occupy Peace, the movement that I've started, OccupyPeace.com.
[02:39:00.798 --> 02:39:05.742]  Close all the bases overseas and bring the troops back to protect the homeland.
[02:39:06.423 --> 02:39:07.444]  That's the first thing.
[02:39:07.844 --> 02:39:13.689]  Number two, I suggested, this is my suggestion on how to solve this problem.
[02:39:14.409 --> 02:39:15.350]  Let the people vote.
[02:39:15.370 --> 02:39:17.932]  And it's a very simple referendum.
[02:39:18.626 --> 02:39:24.091]  Do you want to spend X billions of dollars to construct a wall?
[02:39:24.791 --> 02:39:25.652]  You have yes or no.
[02:39:26.213 --> 02:39:28.215]  Or B, you could say yes or no.
[02:39:28.615 --> 02:39:34.600]  Or B, yes, I want to bring in more refugees and immigrants.
[02:39:35.181 --> 02:39:41.046]  It will cost me X amount of dollars for each one that comes in.
[02:39:41.966 --> 02:39:54.389]  So what I say to people, if you want to house them, if you want to educate them, if you want to take care of their health care, if you want to feed them, then that's your choice.
[02:39:54.789 --> 02:39:57.750]  But don't tell me that I have to do the same thing.
[02:39:58.350 --> 02:40:03.051]  So I'm saying I believe we should have a national referendum.
[02:40:03.931 --> 02:40:06.472]  Open the borders or close the borders.
[02:40:07.349 --> 02:40:08.330]  It's as simple as that.
[02:40:08.350 --> 02:40:20.562]  And, by the way, how come we don't hear this kind of vitriol coming from that congresswoman about what they're doing in Hungary, what they're doing in Austria, what they're doing in Poland, what they're doing in the Czech Republic?
[02:40:21.167 --> 02:40:27.429]  What they're now doing in Italy, they cannot, they don't want other people coming in until they can take care of their own.
[02:40:27.589 --> 02:40:37.613]  Oh, and I forgot Germany, and you look what happened to Angela Merkel, because she allowed some 2 million refugees to come in, and now you can see the other movements going on against it.
[02:40:37.893 --> 02:40:43.715]  So what I'm saying is, who are these people, these little privileged people, to tell us what to do?
[02:40:44.196 --> 02:40:45.036]  Let the people vote.
[02:40:45.606 --> 02:40:52.770]  If we could bank online, we could vote online, this should be a referendum of the American people, not the political interests.
[02:40:53.890 --> 02:40:58.453]  And you forgot, Brazil, Italy, Brazil's closed its borders to Venezuela.
[02:40:58.973 --> 02:41:02.175]  I mean, you've got collapsing countries on your border, you can't let that happen.
[02:41:03.135 --> 02:41:03.756]  Exactly.
[02:41:04.596 --> 02:41:07.778]  And again, all these people, that Congresswoman, A.U.
[02:41:09.059 --> 02:41:18.466]  Bring in a family, bring in as many people as you want, you pay for their education, you feed them, you house them, and you pay for their health care.
[02:41:19.847 --> 02:41:25.431]  So, unless you do that, don't give me your BS, because talk is cheap.
[02:41:25.811 --> 02:41:28.273]  Put your money where your mouth is, capisce?
[02:41:30.215 --> 02:41:33.897]  Well, we know the UN is using third world populations as an invasion force and
[02:41:35.154 --> 02:41:36.335]  I don't blame people wanting to come here.
[02:41:36.415 --> 02:41:44.662]  The difference is we don't have an educational system that can deprogram these people, and they're all voting for socialism, basically, and that's the crisis.
[02:41:44.702 --> 02:41:45.722]  We're going to come back, Gerald.
[02:41:45.742 --> 02:41:47.384]  I want to get your take on the 2020 field.
[02:41:47.844 --> 02:41:49.005]  You've got some private predictions.
[02:41:49.025 --> 02:41:53.508]  I don't know if you want to share those yet about who you think their golden man or woman is.
[02:41:54.329 --> 02:42:04.360]  Well, what you think Trump should do on many fronts, because I'm critical on Trump not fighting internet censorship, and you know, I agree we shouldn't go take over Venezuela, but if it collapses, what do you do?
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:14.610]  I want to ask you, well just starting now though, it is good that he tried to get out of Afghanistan and Syria, but then the government and both parties threatened to impeach him and just say no.
[02:42:15.051 --> 02:42:16.813]  I mean, talk about deep state, my goodness.
[02:42:19.633 --> 02:42:20.413]  What do you think about that?
[02:42:20.633 --> 02:42:25.816]  As we go to break, I mean, just the refusal... Well, again, it is the deep state.
[02:42:25.876 --> 02:42:27.056]  They don't want it.
[02:42:27.616 --> 02:42:30.758]  And they don't want to do a lot of the things that he wants.
[02:42:31.218 --> 02:42:33.859]  And it's very clear with Afghanistan and Syria.
[02:42:34.716 --> 02:42:44.321]  And so, again, go back to the first day he was elected, the headline in USA Today, new president wins with 74 lawsuits or something like that.
[02:42:44.701 --> 02:42:55.507]  It's been an attack on Trump since the beginning because he has really destroyed both political parties in so many ways, and he's the forerunner of the populist movement.
[02:42:56.247 --> 02:42:59.629]  That's right, and it's happening all over the world, so good things are happening all over the world.
[02:43:04.054 --> 02:43:06.092]  I don't believe the globalists are that smart.
[02:43:09.375 --> 02:43:20.820]  I don't believe you're that stupid that we have this information and that if they shut me down, it's shut down when these pieces of crap are executing this information in front of everybody.
[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:26.382]  Do you know why there have been layoffs at more than 20 major leftist fake news publications?
[02:43:26.522 --> 02:43:28.803]  From BuzzFeed to Newsweek to Vice.
[02:43:29.023 --> 02:43:30.244]  Why did it all happen this week?
[02:43:30.304 --> 02:43:32.965]  Why didn't it happen a month ago or a month from now?
[02:43:33.105 --> 02:43:34.626]  Why wasn't it doled out?
[02:43:34.806 --> 02:43:36.927]  Because it's concerted.
[02:43:38.247 --> 02:43:43.329]  It's like a bombing run with a group of bombers flying in and they've all got targets.
[02:43:43.830 --> 02:43:45.831]  And they're all commanded by their HQ.
[02:43:45.851 --> 02:43:48.632]  And by the way, I don't just think that.
[02:43:48.812 --> 02:43:49.872]  I have their blueprint.
[02:43:50.053 --> 02:43:51.273]  I have their bombing run.
[02:43:51.333 --> 02:43:52.734]  I have their attack profile.
[02:43:52.994 --> 02:43:54.455]  I have their Achilles.
[02:43:55.215 --> 02:43:58.156]  And I'm here telling you their Achilles.
[02:43:58.777 --> 02:44:00.657]  I'm here telling you how to defeat them.
[02:44:01.058 --> 02:44:02.778]  Real intelligence is observation.
[02:44:03.919 --> 02:44:05.500]  Real intelligence is infiltration.
[02:44:06.491 --> 02:44:11.561]  Real intelligence is interfacing banging heads with your enemy.
[02:44:12.403 --> 02:44:17.493]  Because you begin to know your enemy better than the enemy
[02:44:18.464 --> 02:44:19.724]  Trump knows you.
[02:44:19.744 --> 02:44:23.145]  All real warfare that's victorious is psychic.
[02:44:23.285 --> 02:44:29.426]  It can be physical, but that's only to draw out the essence of the enemy's goals and their fears.
[02:44:29.707 --> 02:44:35.208]  And then the commitment to meet your enemy with your goals and your love, love trumps all.
[02:44:35.288 --> 02:44:39.889]  But you have to realistically have the template of victory to be able to take it on.
[02:44:40.649 --> 02:44:53.212]  You can't counter a civilizational ending event, a planned viral demolition of humanity, a Earth-ending termination of the birth of a new species, a new vision, a new world.
[02:44:53.452 --> 02:44:57.073]  You can't counter something like that with lack of vision.
[02:44:57.233 --> 02:44:58.893]  Simply countering their program.
[02:44:58.973 --> 02:45:08.495]  You must offer the world that you see and see if others believe in that world and see how they will then offer information to that world to build a new, better world.
[02:45:08.735 --> 02:45:10.316]  You have to recruit in a war.
[02:45:10.536 --> 02:45:15.318]  And to do that, you need to look for people that aren't just trying to be in charge of something.
[02:45:15.358 --> 02:45:18.480]  You need to look for people that want to be involved in something.
[02:45:18.620 --> 02:45:20.601]  Involved in something bigger than them.
[02:45:20.641 --> 02:45:23.442]  Not because they want to rule people, but because they love people.
[02:45:23.502 --> 02:45:30.306]  Because they love their ancestors, and they love humanity, and they have a vision that they want to add to in the future.
[02:45:31.806 --> 02:45:36.869]  So that all the victories and the successes of our progeny, when we're the ancestors,
[02:45:40.194 --> 02:45:40.414]  I think?
[02:45:56.425 --> 02:45:56.945]  We're good to go.
[02:46:21.266 --> 02:46:23.447]  And that's why I know we're going to win in the end.
[02:46:23.547 --> 02:46:48.342]  But I want to ask you to commit, by word of mouth and by prayer, in the public realm and in personal soul, but also in the physical, the energy you expend every day in the system, to transfer part of that to us, to know that there is a full commitment to push our will against the enemy with everything we've got, and to lean in when their knives are stabbing into our guts, to lean into their hate, and just lean in and take it.
[02:46:49.102 --> 02:46:49.562]  I'm ready.
[02:46:50.243 --> 02:46:51.504]  And I'll lean in and I'll take it.
[02:46:51.804 --> 02:46:57.707]  But I need your backing so that when I swing my sword, it'll absolutely devastate the enemy.
[02:46:57.867 --> 02:47:00.889]  And when I raise my shield, it's your will that empowers it.
[02:47:05.812 --> 02:47:08.474]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:24.700 --> 02:47:31.366]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:34.548 --> 02:47:42.495]  Du, du hast, du hast mich.
[02:47:42.575 --> 02:47:46.859]  Du, du hast, du hast mich.
[02:47:55.279 --> 02:48:05.562]  We have a very entitled, petulant power structure in both parties in this country, and they've hired a lot of yes-men and a lot of cowards to work for them.
[02:48:07.723 --> 02:48:22.348]  And only because of personal experience growing up when I was a kid and other things, I've known FBI agents that were like baseball team coaches and super nice and worked 12 hours a day, 14 hours a day, you know, trying to stop money launderers and bank robbers.
[02:48:22.908 --> 02:48:24.469]  But those are the guys and gals that
[02:48:25.629 --> 02:48:26.189]  Never move up.
[02:48:27.150 --> 02:48:32.333]  The people at the top are the worst mafia, not just this country, but the world has ever seen.
[02:48:33.694 --> 02:48:35.375]  And I have experienced it.
[02:48:36.936 --> 02:48:41.079]  I mean, I've gotten good information from FBI agents and federal marshals that was national news.
[02:48:41.860 --> 02:48:44.622]  And I've also had them try to, you know, set me up.
[02:48:45.322 --> 02:48:49.605]  But it was always special political crony groups.
[02:48:50.786 --> 02:48:53.547]  And if we could just clean those out, we'd have a better start.
[02:48:55.540 --> 02:48:56.440]  Let me tell you something.
[02:48:56.460 --> 02:49:02.043]  When you get the raw footage of CNN setting up and being directed by the FBI like a Steven Spielberg movie.
[02:49:03.303 --> 02:49:04.464]  And I only got it at 9 a.m.
[02:49:04.504 --> 02:49:04.904]  this morning.
[02:49:04.984 --> 02:49:06.305]  It was FedEx to me overnight.
[02:49:06.725 --> 02:49:07.445]  We were here waiting.
[02:49:07.465 --> 02:49:08.606]  We thought the truck would come at 10.
[02:49:08.706 --> 02:49:09.886]  It came at like 9.15.
[02:49:10.467 --> 02:49:11.227]  We ran in.
[02:49:11.307 --> 02:49:13.268]  There was, you know, a ton of it.
[02:49:15.089 --> 02:49:19.751]  And then there's the train wreck of trying to grab it and blow people's faces.
[02:49:19.911 --> 02:49:21.872]  And then just all of it.
[02:49:22.072 --> 02:49:23.132]  It drives me crazy.
[02:49:23.212 --> 02:49:24.173]  But you're sitting there.
[02:49:25.171 --> 02:49:28.313]  And like, I didn't want to believe they're patting the camera guy on the back.
[02:49:28.434 --> 02:49:42.044]  I didn't want to believe they lied and violated federal law and released an indictment before they should, even though they messed up and sent it to Roger and CNN had the day stamp the day before, before the grand jury even actually billed it, CNN had it.
[02:49:43.145 --> 02:49:49.309]  So CNN is just such at the heart of this and the raw video, the articles are now on Infowars.com.
[02:49:50.799 --> 02:49:54.902]  You want to go see those for yourself and I noticed this is about a few hours no coverage.
[02:49:56.783 --> 02:50:09.993]  You'd think something like this like hey here's the raw footage at Roger Stone's house that shows CNN out there with the FBI direct to the camera and they're talking and set up the tripod the FBI's there pat them on the back and you'd think like that would be huge but no.
[02:50:12.369 --> 02:50:13.370]  It's so powerful.
[02:50:13.710 --> 02:50:17.253]  They're all meeting right now and trying to figure out what to do.
[02:50:18.014 --> 02:50:23.679]  And Attorney General, Acting Attorney General Whitaker, you know, said, yeah, we need basically a criminal investigation of this.
[02:50:23.999 --> 02:50:26.241]  That's today before this is out, Gerald.
[02:50:27.021 --> 02:50:32.446]  But people have to understand, like, if I'm going to release something like that, there's no group above me giving me orders.
[02:50:33.427 --> 02:50:35.509]  And it's not even a... Go ahead, Gerald.
[02:50:36.329 --> 02:50:38.171]  No, there should be a criminal investigation.
[02:50:38.777 --> 02:50:42.139]  And it's disgusting that they're in bed with the media.
[02:50:42.499 --> 02:50:44.180]  Again, that's why I call them prostitutes.
[02:50:44.560 --> 02:50:51.883]  They get paid to put out by their Washington hornmasters or corporate johns.
[02:50:52.344 --> 02:50:54.004]  And this is the perfect example of it.
[02:50:54.044 --> 02:50:55.025]  This is a disgrace.
[02:50:55.700 --> 02:51:02.823]  And again, that the people that executed this, I mean, how come they didn't fight against their higher-ups and say, we can't do this, this isn't right.
[02:51:03.163 --> 02:51:07.224]  We're gonna arrest a guy, serve him with a warrant, and put on a show like this?
[02:51:07.324 --> 02:51:08.265]  Why are we doing this?
[02:51:09.005 --> 02:51:11.106]  So where's the morality, is what I'm saying.
[02:51:12.246 --> 02:51:15.187]  Oh, they're not stopping the smugglers with kidnapped kids.
[02:51:15.247 --> 02:51:16.128]  Oh, leave them alone.
[02:51:16.488 --> 02:51:20.870]  No, but some guy with no criminal record, let's stage a whole event to make it look like he's guilty.
[02:51:20.890 --> 02:51:24.191]  I mean, you're literally becoming, like, dress-up people here.
[02:51:25.691 --> 02:51:31.639]  Well, that's what they do, because the people think, for example, that an indictment is a judgment.
[02:51:32.200 --> 02:51:34.362]  And they keep, you know, and it's not.
[02:51:34.903 --> 02:51:36.545]  But they, but that's what they do.
[02:51:36.665 --> 02:51:37.807]  So it makes it look like
[02:51:38.527 --> 02:51:41.048]  He did something wrong, and now he's paying for it.
[02:51:41.929 --> 02:51:42.529]  Well, here's an example.
[02:51:42.549 --> 02:51:49.532]  There's another New York Times article out today, and it's like, Judge rules that Jones has got to show his marketing for Sandy Hook.
[02:51:50.113 --> 02:51:52.534]  As if we ever go, we're going to cover a news article.
[02:51:52.874 --> 02:51:53.794]  What's our marketing?
[02:51:54.135 --> 02:51:57.676]  Marketing is a t-shirt, or a book, or a video, or a water filter.
[02:51:57.696 --> 02:51:58.337]  I go out and look.
[02:51:58.377 --> 02:51:59.457]  What's the best-selling thing?
[02:51:59.757 --> 02:52:00.818]  What's really good for people?
[02:52:01.298 --> 02:52:03.739]  What can I buy en masse and undercut the competition?
[02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:04.680]  And...
[02:52:05.620 --> 02:52:10.264]  But they're like, it's just, it's like in the court filing, give us the marketing.
[02:52:10.284 --> 02:52:13.666]  And they're like, well, the judge will get mad if you don't give them that marketing.
[02:52:13.986 --> 02:52:21.992]  It's like saying, the judge will get mad if you don't give them that purple unicorn you've got in the backseat, you know, or in the closet, or if you don't give us that Martian you've got.
[02:52:22.073 --> 02:52:24.875]  It's like, Sandy Hook was barely something we ever even covered.
[02:52:25.175 --> 02:52:29.558]  The media made that who I was, then won't shut up about it.
[02:52:29.638 --> 02:52:33.141]  And at the end of the New York Times, they go, crazies keep coming after the parents.
[02:52:33.221 --> 02:52:34.102]  Jones won't stop.
[02:52:35.023 --> 02:52:36.324]  So we've got to take him out.
[02:52:37.085 --> 02:52:39.047]  Meanwhile, for years, I'm like, I thought it happened.
[02:52:39.087 --> 02:52:39.948]  Don't go to their houses.
[02:52:40.268 --> 02:52:43.451]  But it's like a unified press involved in fraud.
[02:52:43.471 --> 02:52:44.492]  I don't know how you deal with it, Gerald.
[02:52:45.513 --> 02:52:46.333]  Well, you can't.
[02:52:46.594 --> 02:52:48.596]  And again, they are involved in fraud.
[02:52:49.056 --> 02:52:54.701]  You know, it's a whole different media out there, where you have six companies controlled 90 percent of the media.
[02:52:55.202 --> 02:53:00.947]  And you can see their favoritism, whether it's, you know, Fox on one side or all the rest on the other side.
[02:53:01.511 --> 02:53:02.372]  So that's all it is.
[02:53:02.672 --> 02:53:03.613]  It's the corporate media.
[02:53:03.653 --> 02:53:04.813]  There is no free media.
[02:53:05.114 --> 02:53:09.457]  And that's why, by the way, everyone listening should do all you can to support InfoWars.
[02:53:09.917 --> 02:53:10.817]  I buy their products.
[02:53:10.857 --> 02:53:11.398]  They're great.
[02:53:11.818 --> 02:53:12.719]  They're first class.
[02:53:13.059 --> 02:53:16.441]  And if we don't have this, it's going to be a censorship nation.
[02:53:16.842 --> 02:53:18.263]  And it's going on around the world.
[02:53:18.543 --> 02:53:21.945]  They're closing down everybody that doesn't follow their pitch.
[02:53:22.586 --> 02:53:24.287]  So we're in a very dangerous time.
[02:53:24.327 --> 02:53:27.429]  Matter of fact, that's another one of our top trends for 2019 is censorship.
[02:53:29.629 --> 02:53:31.310]  2019, it's only going to get worse.
[02:53:32.531 --> 02:53:41.416]  What's going to happen, you think, with the Socialists and, like, the mainline Democratic Party now sounding like Che Guevara and Joe Stalin?
[02:53:42.517 --> 02:53:46.400]  Well, you know, we were the first magazine to call Donald Trump a winner in May of 2016.
[02:53:46.960 --> 02:53:56.846]  And our forecast of the Democratic presidential candidate we're making now on your show, it's going to be Beto O'Rourke.
[02:53:57.682 --> 02:54:03.183]  And the reason being, you mentioned before about the socialist thing, that only plays to one audience.
[02:54:04.003 --> 02:54:06.764]  Beto O'Rourke is going to be able to get a lot of young people.
[02:54:07.224 --> 02:54:14.185]  Most importantly, I wrote about this in the Trends Journal in 2008, when Oprah took Obama under her wing.
[02:54:14.625 --> 02:54:15.825]  I've been on Oprah twice.
[02:54:16.425 --> 02:54:21.966]  I've been on every major media show you know, name it, from Brian Williams, and all of them, you know.
[02:54:22.886 --> 02:54:25.127]  And nobody put on a show like her.
[02:54:25.587 --> 02:54:25.907]  No one.
[02:54:26.883 --> 02:54:28.744]  She was the queen of TV talk.
[02:54:29.345 --> 02:54:36.890]  When she took Obama under her wing, and we wrote about this in the Trends Journal, he knew how to play that act.
[02:54:37.370 --> 02:54:39.452]  He never went off script.
[02:54:40.092 --> 02:54:40.653]  Guess what?
[02:54:41.653 --> 02:54:56.464]  Oprah just took Beto O'Rourke under her wing, hugged him in front of everybody, had him on her show, and now you're going to start seeing more and more publicity promoting him
[02:54:57.338 --> 02:54:59.519]  And we had made this forecast, by the way.
[02:54:59.639 --> 02:55:01.579]  I'd sit on David Knight a couple of days ago.
[02:55:02.799 --> 02:55:04.520]  Yesterday's New York Times.
[02:55:05.460 --> 02:55:08.141]  And I told my staff this was going to happen on Monday.
[02:55:09.341 --> 02:55:16.383]  Yesterday's New York Times, a front page story of Beto O'Rourke when he lived in New York.
[02:55:16.763 --> 02:55:19.364]  You open it up to the back, a full page.
[02:55:20.044 --> 02:55:21.305]  And you know what it's filled with?
[02:55:22.305 --> 02:55:22.705]  Nothing.
[02:55:23.405 --> 02:55:24.705]  An empty shell.
[02:55:25.186 --> 02:55:26.686]  And what they also leave out
[02:55:27.290 --> 02:55:33.635]  Is that Beto's daddy-in-law is a billionaire, and they know how to raise money.
[02:55:34.256 --> 02:55:37.238]  This is going to be the white Obama.
[02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:40.361]  I agree.
[02:55:40.421 --> 02:55:47.427]  Out of the whole field, they're making the socialists all look terrible, but meanwhile he's just as globalist as they are, and Peter O'Rourke
[02:55:48.531 --> 02:55:51.293]  Uh, and his whole sweaty shirt routine is fake.
[02:55:51.313 --> 02:55:52.494]  Oh, don't look like this!
[02:55:52.794 --> 02:55:53.654]  Like Bernie Sanders.
[02:55:54.015 --> 02:55:56.176]  I mean, he is just, what a disgusting joke.
[02:55:56.196 --> 02:55:56.776]  He's a nothing.
[02:55:57.317 --> 02:56:03.180]  You read this article, everybody listening, go to the, go to yesterday's New York Times, and read Beto O'Rourke.
[02:56:03.561 --> 02:56:03.861]  Nothing.
[02:56:04.341 --> 02:56:06.803]  The guy's a total loser of nothing.
[02:56:07.283 --> 02:56:14.568]  If daddy was an important guy over there, around where he lived, and his uncle didn't have a place, this guy was a nobody.
[02:56:14.588 --> 02:56:16.329]  A zero.
[02:56:17.386 --> 02:56:20.910]  And that's all he is, but hey, Alex Jones.
[02:56:22.071 --> 02:56:23.393]  Add up Obama.
[02:56:24.094 --> 02:56:25.255]  What are the Os?
[02:56:25.956 --> 02:56:26.877]  Obama.
[02:56:27.057 --> 02:56:27.958]  Zero.
[02:56:27.978 --> 02:56:33.824]  A zero-nothing community organizer who organized nothing.
[02:56:34.345 --> 02:56:37.649]  Brought in by the Pritzker family, owns the higher chain.
[02:56:38.405 --> 02:56:39.145]  A nothing!
[02:56:39.205 --> 02:56:40.265]  A nobody!
[02:56:41.006 --> 02:56:43.726]  They're doing the same thing with this nobody.
[02:56:44.186 --> 02:56:56.109]  The Millennials, the Generation Z, all those young people that haven't voted before, that's who they're going to get out, plus all the other people on the other side.
[02:56:56.249 --> 02:56:56.749]  That's right.
[02:56:56.769 --> 02:57:05.811]  Their beta test, their Beto test, I mean, they almost turned Texas blue, and now they're going to try to launch Beto.
[02:57:05.831 --> 02:57:06.711]  I mean, I agree with you.
[02:57:08.385 --> 02:57:10.527]  Even more than Kamala Harris or all these other people.
[02:57:10.567 --> 02:57:12.869]  I mean, I think he's their main weapon.
[02:57:13.729 --> 02:57:13.929]  Yep.
[02:57:14.530 --> 02:57:15.671]  That's our forecast.
[02:57:16.331 --> 02:57:17.292]  He's going to be it.
[02:57:17.912 --> 02:57:20.815]  And you're going to start looking at the publicity that he's going to get.
[02:57:21.055 --> 02:57:23.737]  Why they put this story in the New York Times today.
[02:57:24.177 --> 02:57:25.758]  It was totally worthless.
[02:57:26.079 --> 02:57:26.959]  I'll tell you why.
[02:57:27.960 --> 02:57:30.862]  Because they paid to get it in there one way or another.
[02:57:31.943 --> 02:57:34.665]  Well, he's the anointed serial killer lookalike.
[02:57:34.705 --> 02:57:35.826]  I mean, he's our God.
[02:57:35.846 --> 02:57:36.407]  He's our Lord.
[02:57:36.887 --> 02:57:37.748]  He's totally fake.
[02:57:38.476 --> 02:57:40.097]  Gerald Cilente, TrendsResearch.com.
[02:57:40.137 --> 02:57:40.657]  Thank you so much.
[02:57:40.697 --> 02:57:41.197]  Great job.
[02:57:41.737 --> 02:57:42.037]  Thank you.
[02:57:42.217 --> 02:57:42.798]  Thank you, sir.
[02:57:42.838 --> 02:57:44.698]  We've got so much more coming up in the next hour.
[02:57:44.758 --> 02:57:47.519]  The big exclusive is on Infowars.com.
[02:57:48.480 --> 02:57:50.561]  CNN caught staging the raid with the FBI.
[02:57:50.601 --> 02:57:51.401]  They are in big trouble.
[02:57:52.637 --> 02:57:59.986]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[02:58:00.607 --> 02:58:06.434]  And a lot of times we reach out to top companies and they don't want to private label to us because, well, we're InfoWars and we've been demonized.
[02:58:06.474 --> 02:58:10.779]  But a lot of times, people will work with us only because we're InfoWars.
[02:58:11.360 --> 02:58:26.948]  Well, there is a national company, and I'm not going to name them because we're not in competition with them, but we probably label the product, who has FDA approval for years to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there until you get to prescription level of wound gel that can be sold in stores.
[02:58:27.608 --> 02:58:34.472]  And we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[02:58:35.072 --> 02:58:36.713]  But the announcement here today is this.
[02:58:37.414 --> 02:58:40.876]  We've been selling a lot of the WoundShell and a lot of the ImmuneGuard.
[02:58:41.336 --> 02:58:43.598]  In fact, we just put in big orders for both of them.
[02:58:44.378 --> 02:58:55.104]  But then I noticed without us even plugging it, because of all the scary stuff going on this winter with viruses and bacteria spreading at record levels, that it was all flying off the shelves at regular price.
[02:58:55.785 --> 02:59:01.468]  And so unlike other companies and other groups that do things like raise prices during a crisis,
[02:59:02.088 --> 02:59:10.715]  We're going to go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at empholperslife.com and empholperstore.com.
[02:59:11.175 --> 02:59:12.076]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:59:12.416 --> 02:59:16.339]  We're going to go to 40% off because I just put a big order in.
[02:59:16.639 --> 02:59:22.283]  It'll be a few months till more comes in, but I want you to have the impetus and the initiative to get it for yourself and your family.
[02:59:23.064 --> 02:59:26.426]  Get a great discount, see how great it works, and become a repeat customer.
[02:59:26.666 --> 02:59:31.368]  It's just as a Texan, and as American, and as a patriot, that's how I want to be treated.
[02:59:31.848 --> 02:59:39.131]  That when there's a crisis, if people really need something and want it, I'm going to sell it at a huge discount instead of selling it at full price, because I noticed you were buying it.
[02:59:39.471 --> 02:59:50.016]  So because you're supporting us and already buying it, both the products, 40% off as a combo, or 40% off individually, while supplies last, at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:59:55.020 --> 03:00:00.962]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:12.405 --> 03:00:17.467]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:19.993 --> 03:00:31.101]  So Roger Stone, over a week ago, gives the House and Senate Judiciary Committees the raw footage of the raid on his house, CNN coordinating with the FBI, all on video.
[03:00:32.663 --> 03:00:35.205]  Then it gets leaked last night to Sinclair, a small clip.
[03:00:35.245 --> 03:00:36.506]  So Roger, overnights,
[03:00:37.742 --> 03:00:39.623]  via FedEx and UPS just to be safe.
[03:00:40.163 --> 03:00:42.164]  We get the FedEx at like 9 15 a.m.
[03:00:42.985 --> 03:00:44.285]  It's incredible footage.
[03:00:44.345 --> 03:00:47.287]  It shows CNN being directed by the FBI.
[03:00:47.327 --> 03:00:48.147]  Whole thing staged.
[03:00:48.407 --> 03:00:50.628]  Absolutely impeaches what they've said.
[03:00:51.269 --> 03:00:54.150]  That's been out now for three hours.
[03:00:54.170 --> 03:00:58.172]  We've been covering it at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[03:00:58.772 --> 03:00:59.253]  Three hours.
[03:00:59.913 --> 03:01:05.276]  And the only place you're seeing it or hearing it is Infowars.com
[03:01:08.371 --> 03:01:12.192]  Or newswars.com or on the syndicated radio slash TV broadcast.
[03:01:13.413 --> 03:01:15.353]  That's globalist discipline.
[03:01:18.194 --> 03:01:25.977]  Sinclair had somebody in the House or Senate judiciary leak this footage.
[03:01:27.177 --> 03:01:28.858]  A little bit of it.
[03:01:28.878 --> 03:01:31.359]  And it was on the news everywhere within an hour.
[03:01:32.939 --> 03:01:35.380]  Released at 4.30, everywhere by 6 o'clock.
[03:01:36.929 --> 03:01:38.590]  Central, you're watching it live time here.
[03:01:39.271 --> 03:01:41.153]  This has been out three hours.
[03:01:42.113 --> 03:01:46.737]  The footage posted to Infowars.com, Newswars.com, from Roger Stone.
[03:01:46.937 --> 03:01:47.578]  It's the raid.
[03:01:47.978 --> 03:01:49.800]  It's CNN being directed by the FBI.
[03:01:49.940 --> 03:01:50.641]  It's everything.
[03:01:50.941 --> 03:02:01.730]  And they're all sitting around with such control over News Corp and Time Warner and NBC and all of it.
[03:02:02.190 --> 03:02:03.912]  They've got such control.
[03:02:05.009 --> 03:02:06.409]  That there's zero coverage.
[03:02:06.689 --> 03:02:07.149]  Doesn't matter.
[03:02:08.570 --> 03:02:09.590]  They tried to shut us off.
[03:02:09.630 --> 03:02:10.730]  They tried to break us down.
[03:02:10.770 --> 03:02:13.390]  We've held on for year after year in the face of this.
[03:02:13.450 --> 03:02:17.951]  Just leaning into the attack, thanks to your prayers and financial support, and you spreading the word.
[03:02:18.391 --> 03:02:19.351]  All those are paramount.
[03:02:19.912 --> 03:02:21.192]  The prayers are at the top.
[03:02:21.912 --> 03:02:24.632]  Spreading the word is the same as funding.
[03:02:24.652 --> 03:02:26.113]  It all goes together like a horse and carriage.
[03:02:26.613 --> 03:02:27.773]  You can't have one without the other.
[03:02:27.813 --> 03:02:33.254]  But to sit back and know that the councils of government
[03:02:34.019 --> 03:02:42.521]  And the councils and corporations, they are like, oh, that piece of crap Jones and Stone, you know, they have, they have done it again.
[03:02:42.982 --> 03:02:44.902]  They have released the footage.
[03:02:45.522 --> 03:02:50.464]  I don't have people who do makeup or comb my hair, but then sometimes when I get on air, I'm like, oh my God, my hair is sticking out.
[03:02:51.784 --> 03:02:57.986]  But the other shift, I mean, imagine this is the FBI caught leaking felony warrants.
[03:02:58.746 --> 03:02:59.626]  This is all illegal.
[03:02:59.666 --> 03:03:01.787]  This is them caught lying about it to everybody.
[03:03:02.467 --> 03:03:08.109]  And the footage is all there with the FBI all around the camera guy directing him.
[03:03:08.949 --> 03:03:12.350]  I mean, it is just amazing and them lying about it.
[03:03:14.310 --> 03:03:17.791]  The acting AG was brought up and said he was deeply disturbed by it.
[03:03:18.691 --> 03:03:19.652]  Deeply disturbed by it.
[03:03:23.413 --> 03:03:27.554]  But again, we're the ones that are willing to release the information.
[03:03:28.393 --> 03:03:37.120]  And that's why, if you want somebody fighting for you to the end, somebody swinging for the fences every time, it's him, Paul Warsham.
[03:03:38.461 --> 03:03:40.382]  And so again, I want to thank all of you for what you've done.
[03:03:40.402 --> 03:03:48.728]  You've taken us together so far, but now is the time to triple and quadruple down, just to let me know that you're wanting us to keep fighting.
[03:03:51.468 --> 03:03:53.348]  You know, I haven't backed down once.
[03:03:53.448 --> 03:03:54.669]  I've never sold out one time.
[03:03:54.729 --> 03:03:56.549]  I've never taken the cowardly road.
[03:03:56.589 --> 03:04:00.610]  I've never sat there and licked the hand that feeds me.
[03:04:00.730 --> 03:04:01.690]  I just can't do it.
[03:04:02.471 --> 03:04:07.572]  But we are exponentially, everything we do is way more powerful than it ever was.
[03:04:08.572 --> 03:04:12.453]  It's for every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction in Newtonian physics, and we're there!

[03:06:08.402 --> 03:06:09.582]  It's never going to get any better.
[03:06:09.962 --> 03:06:10.802]  Don't look for it.
[03:06:11.103 --> 03:06:12.223]  Be happy with what you got.
[03:06:13.362 --> 03:06:16.445]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[03:06:16.985 --> 03:06:18.626]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[03:06:19.027 --> 03:06:24.691]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[03:06:25.072 --> 03:06:26.293]  Forget the politicians.
[03:06:26.513 --> 03:06:29.795]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[03:06:31.377 --> 03:06:31.837]  You don't.
[03:06:32.598 --> 03:06:33.578]  You have no choice.
[03:06:33.959 --> 03:06:34.880]  You have owners.
[03:06:35.180 --> 03:06:36.121]  They own you.
[03:06:37.438 --> 03:06:38.740]  They own everything.
[03:06:38.760 --> 03:06:40.602]  They own all the important land.
[03:06:40.983 --> 03:06:42.725]  They own and control the corporations.
[03:06:42.765 --> 03:06:46.230]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[03:06:46.250 --> 03:06:47.832]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[03:06:48.153 --> 03:06:52.979]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[03:06:53.159 --> 03:06:54.781]  They got you by the balls!
[03:06:56.283 --> 03:06:58.364]  They want obedient workers.
[03:06:58.825 --> 03:07:00.306]  Obedient workers.
[03:07:00.626 --> 03:07:13.354]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[03:07:13.414 --> 03:07:16.656]  And now, they're coming for your social security money.
[03:07:17.117 --> 03:07:19.778]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[03:07:21.199 --> 03:07:22.120]  It's a big club.
[03:07:23.069 --> 03:07:23.890]  And you ain't in it.
[03:07:24.510 --> 03:07:27.192]  You and I are not in the big club.
[03:07:27.573 --> 03:07:29.534]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[03:07:30.155 --> 03:07:33.898]  It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[03:07:35.299 --> 03:07:36.820]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[03:07:37.160 --> 03:07:40.643]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[03:07:40.683 --> 03:07:44.586]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[03:07:44.606 --> 03:07:45.587]  They're not interested in that.
[03:07:45.847 --> 03:07:46.808]  That doesn't help them.
[03:07:47.168 --> 03:07:48.569]  That's against their interest.
[03:07:49.049 --> 03:07:49.450]  That's right.
[03:07:53.866 --> 03:07:56.167]  That's why they want Infowars shut down.
[03:07:58.007 --> 03:08:08.171]  Because Trump and others really do want prosperity, and we want a big middle class, and we're not trying to transsexualize everybody's kids and bring in this crap.
[03:08:10.292 --> 03:08:11.912]  America's got cancer, we gotta fix it.
[03:08:14.253 --> 03:08:15.873]  We've got a special guest host coming up.
[03:08:15.893 --> 03:08:18.814]  I think Baggish always does a great job in the next segment.
[03:08:18.974 --> 03:08:22.296]  I wanted to play this Paul Watson report that's up on Infowars.com.
[03:08:23.843 --> 03:08:26.685]  Then they came for the memes, the next phase of the war on free speech.
[03:08:26.805 --> 03:08:28.305]  It's unbelievable.
[03:08:30.346 --> 03:08:32.348]  Yeah, I'm proud they came for me first.
[03:08:35.169 --> 03:08:39.391]  Also, Twitter bans investigation of Jack Dorsey, Joe Rogan, Bitcoin pump and dump scam.
[03:08:39.972 --> 03:08:41.853]  That's a big report up on InfoWars.com.
[03:08:42.353 --> 03:08:44.074]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[03:08:45.325 --> 03:08:49.586]  How criminal this has gotten, how sick it's gotten, and all the cowards batting with the system.
[03:08:50.266 --> 03:08:53.627]  And then a new gun bill would require buyers reveal social media history.
[03:08:54.047 --> 03:08:56.387]  CBS News told you about that, but now it's official.
[03:08:57.127 --> 03:08:58.088]  That's in Illinois.
[03:09:03.309 --> 03:09:06.509]  Meanwhile, we've got a bunch of other big articles.
[03:09:06.549 --> 03:09:07.709]  This whole Jeff Bezos thing.
[03:09:08.010 --> 03:09:09.890]  You know, I agree with what Jeff Bezos is saying.
[03:09:11.974 --> 03:09:16.556]  The threats he was sent by the Inquirer does sound like blackmail.
[03:09:16.576 --> 03:09:20.177]  The only problem is his publication, the Washington Post, does that all day long.
[03:09:22.958 --> 03:09:24.759]  And so this thing is going crazy now.
[03:09:25.099 --> 03:09:27.720]  He's claiming some government agency leaked the info.
[03:09:28.260 --> 03:09:35.663]  Oh, Bezos, you don't like government agencies leak you in your Dick Cheney photos?
[03:09:39.434 --> 03:09:40.375]  Yeah, it's weaponized media.
[03:09:40.395 --> 03:09:41.276]  It's who these people become.
[03:09:41.296 --> 03:09:42.378]  What do you think the Washington Post?
[03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:49.747]  All these groups do, they spend all their time trying to wreck independent real media, and they engage in criminal activities, and what happens to them?
[03:09:49.767 --> 03:09:52.250]  They howl and pull.
[03:09:53.919 --> 03:09:54.619]  Like it's the end of the world.
[03:09:55.219 --> 03:09:56.819]  We're going to go to Paul Watts' report right now.
[03:09:56.960 --> 03:10:09.022]  Please don't forget, we've got some of the biggest sales ever running at InfoWarsTore.com on BrainForce Plus, on TurboForce, on the other great products like the Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[03:10:09.302 --> 03:10:13.442]  Without you supporting us, 94% reviews on TurboForce, we will not be here.
[03:10:13.482 --> 03:10:18.603]  So please, go to InfoWarsTore.com or AAA253-3139.
[03:10:18.643 --> 03:10:19.503]  Without you, we won't be here.
[03:10:19.523 --> 03:10:22.024]  Plus, these are great products you need, so thank you all for your support.
[03:10:22.284 --> 03:10:23.284]  Here's Paul Watts' report.
[03:10:24.360 --> 03:10:28.886]  So BuzzFeed, which just laid off 15% of its staff... Please, not BuzzFeed.
[03:10:28.906 --> 03:10:29.627]  Please stop BuzzFeed.
[03:10:29.687 --> 03:10:31.430]  Please, not BuzzFeed.
[03:10:31.470 --> 03:10:39.581]  ...depriving us of cutting-edge, insightful content like this, sent out a tweet lobbying Twitter to ban memes that make fun of Democrats.
[03:10:39.921 --> 03:10:40.902]  Yes, really.
[03:10:41.082 --> 03:10:54.816]  Twitter is allowing this altered photo comparing women members of Congress who wore white to the State of the Union, to the KKK, to circulate on its platform despite its own policy that doesn't allow symbols historically associated with hate groups!
[03:10:55.056 --> 03:10:55.857]  Bitch, please!
[03:10:55.937 --> 03:11:02.003]  So I guess that accounts that post symbols historically associated with hate groups should be banned, right?
[03:11:02.103 --> 03:11:03.764]  And who would that include?
[03:11:04.585 --> 03:11:05.747]  Gee, I wonder.
[03:11:06.027 --> 03:11:07.148]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[03:11:07.709 --> 03:11:08.490]  BuzzFeed!
[03:11:08.630 --> 03:11:13.796]  The rules actually state that hateful images are only banned if they're used to promote racist bigotry.
[03:11:13.856 --> 03:11:19.423]  Making fun of Democrats because a lot of them like to dress up like Klan members isn't racist.
[03:11:19.723 --> 03:11:22.186]  Actually dressing up like Klan members...
[03:11:23.848 --> 03:11:32.594]  Under Buzzfeed's ridiculous interpretation of the rules, the very yearbook image that started the Governor Northam KKK scandal would have been banned.
[03:11:33.055 --> 03:11:34.055]  And that's the point.
[03:11:34.115 --> 03:11:42.281]  This whole crusade against memes is just another attempt by the establishment left to de-platform and silence its political adversaries.
[03:11:42.342 --> 03:11:44.123]  When we say the left can't meme,
[03:11:44.383 --> 03:11:46.645]  That's not just some overused cliche.
[03:11:46.785 --> 03:11:48.106]  It's science, bitches!
[03:11:48.286 --> 03:11:54.492]  A study by University College London found that the most effectively spread memes largely originated in two places.
[03:11:54.752 --> 03:11:57.654]  The Donald subreddit and 4chan's poll.
[03:11:57.754 --> 03:12:02.258]  The New York Times admitted that political memes were a major, quote, tool of influence.
[03:12:02.398 --> 03:12:07.843]  Salon.com warned that, quote, the ability of memes to communicate ideology is boundless.
[03:12:08.083 --> 03:12:11.784]  The meme makers of this world are truly the intellectuals of this world.
[03:12:11.864 --> 03:12:13.504]  Memes can change history.
[03:12:13.604 --> 03:12:22.486]  As Richard Dawkins first explained, memes are like genes for information and human evolution has been guided as much by memes as by genes.
[03:12:22.686 --> 03:12:23.646]  Memes matter.
[03:12:23.927 --> 03:12:25.127]  Memes win elections.
[03:12:25.687 --> 03:12:26.767]  That's how memes work.
[03:12:26.907 --> 03:12:34.449]  But the left is so entrenched in political correctness that they've lost their sense of humor and are permanently walking on eggshells.
[03:12:34.929 --> 03:12:36.911]  Why they're terrible at memes.
[03:12:37.431 --> 03:12:39.073]  At best, they're hit and miss.
[03:12:39.233 --> 03:12:40.774]  I guess they never miss, huh?
[03:12:41.035 --> 03:12:41.855]  Sorry, couldn't resist.
[03:12:41.895 --> 03:12:49.382]  So ask yourself, is it worthwhile for the left to engage in meme warfare, or is it far easier just to ban memes?
[03:12:49.502 --> 03:12:54.166]  Why is the EU trying to ram through its meme-killing Article 13 legislation?
[03:12:54.226 --> 03:13:00.212]  Why is Facebook simultaneously developing algorithms that will detect and delete offensive memes?
[03:13:00.352 --> 03:13:01.313]  Why did Twitter
[03:13:01.573 --> 03:13:06.615]  Launch a purge of thousands of accounts that adopted the NPC meme.
[03:13:22.317 --> 03:13:27.002]  If you can't censor them for what they say, censor them for what they meme.
[03:13:27.142 --> 03:13:33.710]  Why are prominent personalities on Twitter having their accounts locked for tweeting the hashtag learn to code meme?
[03:13:33.850 --> 03:13:41.879]  Basically we're approaching the day where anything that hurts the fee fees of left-wing digital journalists is a bannable offense.
[03:13:42.079 --> 03:13:49.783]  They're so precious, so emotionally incapable of handling banter, they run to the hall monitor and start crying at the drop of a hat.
[03:13:49.903 --> 03:13:54.485]  Why did Twitter suspend James Woods for posting a satirical political meme?
[03:13:54.585 --> 03:13:58.927]  Why did CNN threaten to dox the creator of the Trump wrestling meme?
[03:13:59.007 --> 03:14:01.208]  Why was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
[03:14:01.428 --> 03:14:04.489]  So salty over Donald Trump Jr.
[03:14:04.529 --> 03:14:08.971]  posting a meme about her that she threatened him with her subpoena power.
[03:14:09.091 --> 03:14:10.272]  Weird flex, but okay.
[03:14:10.332 --> 03:14:14.854]  Why did Sweden's advertising agency try to ban sexist memes?
[03:14:14.974 --> 03:14:18.976]  Why did Spain try to ban memes that were insulting to politicians?
[03:14:19.076 --> 03:14:23.238]  Why is the media constantly trying to tear down the host of Meme Review?
[03:14:23.658 --> 03:14:24.698]  Everybody's favorite show.
[03:14:24.819 --> 03:14:27.960]  Why are they even blaming memes for childhood obesity?
[03:14:28.120 --> 03:14:32.943]  That's why has the legacy media whipped up a contrived moral panic over memes.
[03:14:34.524 --> 03:14:37.546]  Because they don't understand the language of memes.
[03:14:37.706 --> 03:14:40.348]  They can't engage in memetic warfare.
[03:14:40.428 --> 03:14:44.690]  So far simpler to abuse their power to lobby for memes to be censored.
[03:14:44.790 --> 03:14:50.494]  And in case you forgot, last year Big Tech banned the biggest living meme on the planet.
[03:14:53.319 --> 03:15:04.190]  On the other hand, the left is so full of deranged salty psychos that through sheer weight of numbers alone, negative self-owning memes are generated on a routine basis.
[03:15:08.601 --> 03:15:09.742]  Excuse me, it's ma'am.
[03:15:10.243 --> 03:15:13.726]  It is ma'am.
[03:15:13.826 --> 03:15:19.551]  Every time one of these characters has a public temper tantrum, it's a memetic victory for the right.
[03:15:19.652 --> 03:15:28.600]  I mean, when your behavior turns even warmongering neocon Lindsey Graham into based Lindsey Graham, that's when you know you're losing the meme war.
[03:15:28.700 --> 03:15:29.261]  You are gay.
[03:15:29.621 --> 03:15:32.684]  So BuzzFeed, Huffington Post, Vice Journalists,
[03:15:32.884 --> 03:15:37.566]  Instead of relying on your sycophantic, handing-glove circle-jerk with big tech.
[03:15:37.766 --> 03:15:43.368]  Instead of running, whimpering to the Twitter hall monitors every time a meme hurts your feelings.
[03:15:43.488 --> 03:15:46.689]  Instead of trying to censor memes and have their creators banned.
[03:15:46.829 --> 03:15:53.392]  Instead of trying to crap all over fun, like the joyless pearl-clutchers you are, forget Learn to Code.
[03:15:53.952 --> 03:15:56.073]  How about... Learn to Meme?
[03:16:08.951 --> 03:16:12.925]  This isn't worse, because now everybody hears hype and there's thousands of channels and...
[03:16:14.246 --> 03:16:15.566]  This is the channel that's trying to shut down.
[03:16:15.967 --> 03:16:16.927]  This is what they don't want on there.
[03:16:17.067 --> 03:16:18.347]  This is the wild card.
[03:16:18.507 --> 03:16:21.889]  Time and time again, when nobody else is covering it, we're covering it.
[03:16:22.009 --> 03:16:23.469]  It breaks out, and it defeats them.
[03:16:23.669 --> 03:16:27.170]  So, if you want to defeat the globalists, just keep doing what you've already been doing.
[03:16:27.230 --> 03:16:32.552]  Remember that, yeah, you can get censored or banned on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook for promoting it at fullwars.com links.
[03:16:32.592 --> 03:16:33.193]  We make it easier.
[03:16:33.273 --> 03:16:34.173]  Promote a News Wars link.
[03:16:34.253 --> 03:16:36.694]  That doesn't get you banned 10% as much, but who cares?
[03:16:37.054 --> 03:16:39.695]  They built these platforms to get us in there like a web.
[03:16:40.535 --> 03:16:41.976]  So the spiders would have us caught.
[03:16:42.676 --> 03:16:46.478]  They'd come up and say, do what we say or we'll not let you talk to people.
[03:16:47.438 --> 03:16:48.138]  And you go, okay.
[03:16:48.358 --> 03:16:49.439]  And then you tie her in the web.
[03:16:50.259 --> 03:16:52.740]  And then pretty soon it's like, you can't get free now.
[03:16:53.160 --> 03:16:54.621]  Mmm, delicious.
[03:16:55.181 --> 03:16:59.263]  And that's exactly who Jack Dorsey and all these people are.
[03:16:59.523 --> 03:17:04.145]  Smart ass spiders that all screw each other and lie and just, oh yeah.
[03:17:05.804 --> 03:17:08.431]  We've got a Bitcoin pump and dump.
[03:17:08.531 --> 03:17:12.944]  I dumped my stock before it plunged, and now I'm gonna sucker you back in.
[03:17:16.804 --> 03:17:18.885]  Help me so get ready for them.
[03:17:19.426 --> 03:17:20.726]  That's how the spider operates.
[03:17:20.847 --> 03:17:22.528]  We gotta learn to recognize the spider.
[03:17:22.648 --> 03:17:23.908]  It's in love with itself.
[03:17:24.209 --> 03:17:25.529]  It's fallen.
[03:17:25.749 --> 03:17:28.991]  And it's so sure of itself and how it can destroy everything around it.
[03:17:29.031 --> 03:17:30.672]  But we're here to say no.
[03:17:30.893 --> 03:17:39.518]  Info Wars has been chosen out of the spectrum of resistance because it's one of the leading lights.
[03:17:41.104 --> 03:17:42.565]  The spiders don't like light.
[03:17:42.825 --> 03:17:43.386]  They like dark.
[03:17:44.086 --> 03:17:47.168]  And so, if they're able, they believe, to shut us down.
[03:17:47.348 --> 03:17:51.431]  They believe they've killed a major nexus point for human expression and human freedom.
[03:17:51.811 --> 03:17:55.253]  The Lord works in mysterious ways, but I can tell you this.
[03:17:55.454 --> 03:18:07.442]  The fact that we're persecuted shows we're over the target, and we just have to hold on a few more years into the future for things we're going to do that don't just give us the big victories you've already delivered, blisters, by supporting us.
[03:18:07.542 --> 03:18:08.222]  We're all in this together.
[03:18:11.384 --> 03:18:13.605]  Was you mad he's gotta go through a lot easier?
[03:18:13.705 --> 03:18:15.306]  And I realize that's the commitment.
[03:18:15.486 --> 03:18:22.570]  If I'm willing to go all the way, and if you're willing to go all the way, there's gonna be major dividends for our children and for society and culture.
[03:18:22.690 --> 03:18:28.372]  Where, you know, only a billion people are gonna die in this Armageddon instead of like seven billion.
[03:18:29.013 --> 03:18:31.234]  I mean, seriously, like, just kind of choose your adventure.
[03:18:32.034 --> 03:18:39.776]  If we really get involved now and say no to all this up front, then we're going to go through this metamorphosis and it's going to be rough, but it'll be okay.
[03:18:40.556 --> 03:18:45.598]  If we don't, I tell you, it's a very, very hard road we're going down.
[03:18:46.218 --> 03:18:50.499]  And so I would just ask everybody to really search their heart and soul and commit to this fight.
[03:18:50.519 --> 03:18:51.859]  And thank you all for your financial support.
[03:18:52.099 --> 03:18:54.220]  That's Beyond Critical and FullRestore.com.

[03:20:32.877 --> 03:20:37.279]  And welcome back to InfoWars.com, and this is Nick Fegich.
[03:20:37.939 --> 03:21:01.289]  On this Friday, February 8, 2019, in the last hour of the day, you know, just looking at all of the crazy, really crazy news lately in terms of what's been happening, and I want to kind of paint a different picture about governance and politics, because a couple things have jumped out to me recently that really
[03:21:03.090 --> 03:21:12.054]  illustrate sort of the all-time low in which much of governance has fallen.
[03:21:12.354 --> 03:21:13.735]  But I want to start historically.
[03:21:13.755 --> 03:21:21.159]  I want to give a little bit of background on me again, but I want to talk about this kind of overlap of some of the issues from a personal perspective.
[03:21:21.199 --> 03:21:28.362]  My grandparents and my great-grandparents on my mother's side were immigrants coming into the United States.
[03:21:28.402 --> 03:21:32.504]  My grandfather and grandmother on my father's side immigrated from
[03:21:33.284 --> 03:21:37.068]  Southern Europe from Croatia, what was formerly Yugoslavia.
[03:21:37.608 --> 03:21:43.633]  Originally in Croatia, you know, things kind of change around quite a bit in Europe over the decades and even centuries.
[03:21:45.074 --> 03:21:46.776]  But they came here, my grandfather, 1906.
[03:21:47.537 --> 03:21:48.297]  He was 16.
[03:21:48.337 --> 03:21:49.438]  He went to work in the mines.
[03:21:49.498 --> 03:21:50.499]  He built a life here.
[03:21:50.519 --> 03:21:54.703]  And my son kind of brought this to my attention recently.
[03:21:54.723 --> 03:21:57.705]  My oldest son is 43.
[03:21:58.005 --> 03:21:59.507]  And what he said is, you know,
[03:22:00.228 --> 03:22:11.010]  Those early pictures of immigrants, you know, Italian children, Croatian children, Irish children, they were always waving flags, if you ever go back and look.
[03:22:11.230 --> 03:22:18.671]  And the interesting thing is they were generally, almost always, in fact, always, I can't remember otherwise, they were always American flags.
[03:22:19.411 --> 03:22:23.492]  And people were happy, privileged, excited.
[03:22:23.532 --> 03:22:28.213]  Yeah, there's an image up now, you know, excited to come into the United States.
[03:22:28.453 --> 03:22:29.173]  You know, it was like
[03:22:30.886 --> 03:22:39.336]  The golden opportunity of a global lifetime for anyone on the planet a hundred years ago.
[03:22:39.536 --> 03:22:41.258]  People weren't breaking in the back door.
[03:22:42.059 --> 03:22:43.521]  They were coming through Ellis Island.
[03:22:43.561 --> 03:22:49.328]  They were coming in the front door and really proud and privileged to integrate into this culture.
[03:22:51.036 --> 03:22:52.216]  I think of my grandparents.
[03:22:52.436 --> 03:23:02.159]  My grandparents did not speak very good English, but they absolutely forbid their four children from speaking anything but English.
[03:23:02.359 --> 03:23:10.721]  Even though the whole neighborhood, because everyone kind of clustered together from the various countries of people, came from much in the same way they do in immigrant communities today.
[03:23:12.061 --> 03:23:22.584]  But in those days, the children weren't allowed to speak, at least in my dad's household, Serbo-Croatian or Croatian because they were going to be Americans.
[03:23:22.724 --> 03:23:29.846]  Now, my dad grew up and he understood every word of Croatian, but even as an adult, he couldn't speak it because he knew he'd get in trouble for it, you know?
[03:23:29.866 --> 03:23:30.846]  I mean, think about that.
[03:23:32.126 --> 03:23:34.407]  But that's kind of the backdrop of it.
[03:23:34.467 --> 03:23:38.648]  You know, and I think about even the Pledge of Allegiance, you know, Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.
[03:23:40.646 --> 03:23:45.650]  And the United States of America, which is kind of, you know, sort of the foundation of all this.
[03:23:46.311 --> 03:23:53.417]  And then the next line, the last line, you know, for the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible.
[03:23:53.437 --> 03:24:05.727]  You know, that's kind of interesting when you think of identity politics today and how counter that even runs to that basic pledge of allegiance, you know, indivisible, a nation together, you know.
[03:24:06.705 --> 03:24:07.965]  With liberty and justice.
[03:24:08.125 --> 03:24:08.746]  Really?
[03:24:09.286 --> 03:24:11.006]  Justice for all.
[03:24:11.266 --> 03:24:13.146]  Is that really true today?
[03:24:13.306 --> 03:24:14.127]  Justice for all?
[03:24:14.187 --> 03:24:15.087]  I mean, think about it.
[03:24:16.427 --> 03:24:29.830]  In the court system, if it's a criminal matter or a civil matter, like what Alex is facing right now, it's a million-dollar equation to have justice for the very foundation of what we are as Americans.
[03:24:29.910 --> 03:24:31.270]  The right to free speech.
[03:24:32.211 --> 03:24:34.171]  The First Amendment right to free speech.
[03:24:35.054 --> 03:24:50.106]  You know, when I think about all this and the backdrop of the nonsense about immigration and leadership, and I think about my own family's history, you know, my dad was born during the Depression years.
[03:24:50.747 --> 03:24:58.313]  And, you know, so here you are, you arrive as an immigrant, you're working underground mines, you're making in those days a dollar a day, which was great.
[03:24:58.333 --> 03:25:02.476]  I mean, he had a chance, you know, he built this house with his hands on
[03:25:03.878 --> 03:25:07.320]  Property owned by the mining company, which later became USS Steel.
[03:25:07.380 --> 03:25:10.722]  In fact, up until he died, he was on that property.
[03:25:10.762 --> 03:25:16.345]  When he died, they tore down his house, the last house standing, because it was mining property, after all.
[03:25:16.385 --> 03:25:17.326]  He never even owned it.
[03:25:18.146 --> 03:25:19.747]  And he lived into his 90s.
[03:25:20.147 --> 03:25:21.988]  You know, he lived 80 years in the United States.
[03:25:23.089 --> 03:25:27.211]  But when I think about all that, you know, my dad grew up proud to be an American.
[03:25:27.251 --> 03:25:28.132]  He loved history.
[03:25:28.172 --> 03:25:29.232]  He was a very brilliant guy.
[03:25:31.067 --> 03:25:34.369]  In European history, Russian history, American history, those were his specialties.
[03:25:34.429 --> 03:25:45.076]  And he loved the idea of governance, the idea of him being born here, first generation, the idea that he could actually make a difference in the world, do something in the world.
[03:25:45.156 --> 03:25:53.881]  And he left Minnesota where he lived in his early 20s, moved to Alaska, which was truly a frontier place in the mid-50s.
[03:25:53.921 --> 03:25:57.784]  This was a rough place to land.
[03:25:58.647 --> 03:26:03.192]  And he landed here the next year, brought my mother up a few years before statehood.
[03:26:03.232 --> 03:26:08.858]  And then my dad, six children, my dad and mom, six children were born here in Alaska.
[03:26:09.338 --> 03:26:12.041]  I went, it was still a territory, my sister also.
[03:26:12.714 --> 03:26:18.458]  You know, and we watched this place change and grow, and the governance of Alaska was so different then, you know?
[03:26:18.498 --> 03:26:29.045]  I mean, there were Republicans and Democrats, and people fought like crazy over foundational issues like a state constitution, like how the government was going to be constructed, you know?
[03:26:29.365 --> 03:26:31.026]  We were the last group to do this.
[03:26:31.106 --> 03:26:40.292]  My generation literally grew up in that environment, the environment of a frontier state within a frontier nation.
[03:26:41.193 --> 03:26:54.424]  We were the last to hang on to the foundation of our value system, which has been a big part of my private conversations these days, because that's what should drive government.
[03:26:55.364 --> 03:27:01.930]  That's what should drive the legacy that we're going to leave behind for our grandchildren and children.
[03:27:03.891 --> 03:27:12.624]  Good governance is what it was about in my father's day, and I'm going to dedicate this entire Friday afternoon to this because
[03:27:13.505 --> 03:27:14.926]  It is what it's about.
[03:27:15.106 --> 03:27:19.029]  You know, when I think back again on my dad, you know, he started as a school teacher.
[03:27:19.069 --> 03:27:22.251]  My dad couldn't afford to go to college, all right, for four years.
[03:27:22.771 --> 03:27:28.095]  So he had to get a four-year degree in two years because that's what he could afford, and that's what he did.
[03:27:28.675 --> 03:27:37.581]  He doubled the load, finished top of his class, a four-year degree at 20, and started teaching.
[03:27:37.982 --> 03:27:39.643]  And he came to Alaska,
[03:27:40.063 --> 03:27:43.685]  He was at first, he worked as a inspector on federal projects.
[03:27:43.705 --> 03:27:44.685]  There's an image of my dad.
[03:27:44.785 --> 03:27:45.725]  He died actually at 40.
[03:27:46.606 --> 03:27:48.407]  I've outlived him now by 20 years.
[03:27:49.987 --> 03:27:54.989]  But when I look at dad, you know, his history here, he came up pretty simple guy, you know.
[03:27:55.530 --> 03:28:01.552]  And then he became, after being a federal inspector, as long as he could stomach it until he could get a teaching job, he went into teaching.
[03:28:01.912 --> 03:28:05.354]  He then was a boys counselor when they segregated boys and girls counselors.
[03:28:06.334 --> 03:28:07.175]  He was then a principal.
[03:28:08.735 --> 03:28:11.757]  And then a superintendent of schools at 26 years old.
[03:28:12.797 --> 03:28:16.279]  And then from there, the State Senate, and then on to the United States Congress.
[03:28:17.139 --> 03:28:21.041]  And in all of that, he dealt with a lot of fights, a lot of things.
[03:28:21.081 --> 03:28:26.483]  They tried to stomp him down in so many ways because Dad believed in government.
[03:28:26.563 --> 03:28:30.745]  He believed in government of the people, by the people, and for the people.
[03:28:31.226 --> 03:28:36.048]  He grew up dirt poor like a lot of people have in this country and understood
[03:28:36.608 --> 03:28:41.215]  What it was to struggle, what it was to build, and what it was to be proud of the country that you're in.
[03:28:41.616 --> 03:28:42.837]  We're headed into the break.
[03:28:42.917 --> 03:28:44.139]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:28:44.199 --> 03:28:48.866]  We're in InfoWars, and we are in the InfoWars in the 21st century.
[03:28:48.906 --> 03:28:52.612]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, and we'll be right back after these brief messages.
[03:29:02.225 --> 03:29:10.771]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[03:29:11.111 --> 03:29:24.260]  Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there, and we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[03:29:24.480 --> 03:29:29.024]  We also have another product also produced by the same company, Immune Gargle.
[03:29:29.364 --> 03:29:32.867]  We've been selling a lot of the Wound Gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle.
[03:29:33.547 --> 03:29:42.114]  We're going to go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at InfluenceLife.com and InfluenceTour.com.
[03:29:42.654 --> 03:29:44.976]  This is a limited-time Immune Boost Special.

[03:29:52.604 --> 03:29:55.547]  Again, this is a limited-time Immune Boost Special.
[03:29:55.747 --> 03:30:02.254]  Get Super Blue, Silver Immune Gargle, and Super Silver Wound Dressing for 40% off at InfoWarstore.com.
[03:30:05.325 --> 03:30:08.767]  I cannot say enough nice things about Super Male Vitality right here.
[03:30:09.067 --> 03:30:10.408]  I actually have three of them on my desk.
[03:30:10.448 --> 03:30:11.268]  This is my favorite.
[03:30:11.288 --> 03:30:13.850]  It's heartbreaking that it's going away, I really think.
[03:30:14.230 --> 03:30:15.130]  I mean, really, it's true.
[03:30:15.190 --> 03:30:18.212]  Ever since I've tried these two here, I've also got another one sitting here.
[03:30:18.372 --> 03:30:20.333]  Alpha Power, Super Male Vitality.
[03:30:20.433 --> 03:30:23.375]  They have given me the energy that I did not have.
[03:30:23.395 --> 03:30:27.317]  I mean, my God, I didn't realize how little I was doing before with these two here.
[03:30:27.657 --> 03:30:30.558]  I have the energy to go to the gym at the end of a long day of working.
[03:30:30.578 --> 03:30:33.298]  At the end of doing a broadcast, I have the energy to go to a gym.
[03:30:33.378 --> 03:30:36.879]  And frankly, I really think this is better than anything you're going to get in the store.
[03:30:36.919 --> 03:30:37.679]  It's heartbreaking.
[03:30:37.719 --> 03:30:39.960]  The super male vitality is about to go away.
[03:30:40.000 --> 03:30:43.500]  And again, it's just because you can't find the herbs and you don't want to sell us crap.
[03:30:43.540 --> 03:30:44.640]  But that's what it's all about.
[03:30:44.661 --> 03:30:45.861]  This is the real deal.
[03:30:45.901 --> 03:30:50.622]  You take two droplets of this a couple of times a day and all of a sudden it's like, whoa, I'm a man again.
[03:30:50.882 --> 03:30:56.023]  I have all the power that a steady diet of soy fed through government schools robbed me of.
[03:30:56.083 --> 03:30:56.683]  It's back.
[03:30:57.083 --> 03:30:59.725]  So between that, I've got my X2 right here.
[03:30:59.865 --> 03:31:04.669]  Everything else I've tried, I have a filter in my house, a water filter I just bought for my family.
[03:31:04.789 --> 03:31:07.111]  Everybody loves everything in the Infowar store.
[03:31:07.251 --> 03:31:08.852]  Everything is very reasonably priced.
[03:31:08.972 --> 03:31:10.053]  You're supporting the show.
[03:31:10.093 --> 03:31:11.354]  You're supporting the Infowar.
[03:31:11.454 --> 03:31:14.576]  And really, as conservatives, who are you going to give your money to?
[03:31:14.636 --> 03:31:20.000]  Are you going to go to the supplement store and give it to somebody who probably advertises on Roku?
[03:31:20.120 --> 03:31:22.602]  Or are you going to give your money directly to Alex Jones?
[03:31:22.682 --> 03:31:23.943]  It's an easy choice, I think.
[03:31:24.003 --> 03:31:29.765]  These are exciting times we live in, and yes, super male vitality or female vitality is an aging process.
[03:31:29.825 --> 03:31:30.485]  It's cold-pressed.
[03:31:30.585 --> 03:31:36.048]  It takes three to four times more of the herbs to do it, and it's super, super strong for libido, stamina, energy.
[03:31:36.128 --> 03:31:41.890]  When I first heard about it like six, seven years ago that was being developed, and I actually tried it, I was like, okay, this is actually works.
[03:31:42.090 --> 03:31:46.193]  But I mean, I lost 60, 70 pounds with the X2 and with the SuperMetal Vitality.
[03:31:46.293 --> 03:31:48.355]  I've gained a few pounds back because I barely work out anymore.
[03:31:48.435 --> 03:31:54.619]  And if I wasn't taking it and wasn't taking the X2 and X3, I would definitely be pushing 300 pounds right now.
[03:31:54.879 --> 03:31:59.723]  So get your SuperMetal Vitality, the final run, unless me squeezing them makes me win out on the prize.
[03:31:59.803 --> 03:32:01.044]  So get it today while you still can.
[03:32:05.928 --> 03:32:11.332]  When we go off to war, when we exercise our rights,
[03:32:14.369 --> 03:32:16.591]  When we soar to our greatest heights.
[03:32:17.191 --> 03:32:21.034]  When we mourn and pray.
[03:32:23.957 --> 03:32:25.498]  When our neighbors are at risk.
[03:32:27.780 --> 03:32:29.722]  When our nation is threatened.
[03:32:31.783 --> 03:32:33.905]  There's someone to gather the facts.
[03:32:36.147 --> 03:32:37.188]  To bring you the story.
[03:32:39.930 --> 03:32:41.051]  No matter the cost.
[03:32:43.635 --> 03:32:47.078]  This is why so many people can't stand the mainstream media.
[03:32:47.599 --> 03:32:49.580]  Because knowing empowers us.
[03:32:51.162 --> 03:32:53.084]  Knowing helps us decide.
[03:32:54.505 --> 03:32:58.789]  Knowing keeps us free.
[03:33:06.135 --> 03:33:08.758]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.399 --> 03:33:31.027]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on, for your mind, with Nick Begich.
[03:33:35.672 --> 03:33:42.179]  And welcome back to this fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com.
[03:33:42.199 --> 03:33:43.381]  This is Nick Begich.
[03:33:44.001 --> 03:33:44.282]  Today
[03:33:45.163 --> 03:33:56.119]  Coming into this, you know, talking about my own personal family history and the backdrop of the immigration issues on governance, on discourse, if you will, within the country right now.
[03:33:58.146 --> 03:34:01.949]  You know, this is not a dignified discourse on any level.
[03:34:01.989 --> 03:34:10.477]  You know, my dad, again, and going back to my dad, a student of history, American history, Russian history, and European history, my dad was a genius, encyclopedic.
[03:34:10.937 --> 03:34:20.105]  He could rattle off the history of these countries going back centuries, and the details, and the politics, all the way up into the current frame and the overlaps.
[03:34:20.145 --> 03:34:20.826]  That's just the way
[03:34:21.466 --> 03:34:31.710]  He approached things, and he was the ability, multi-interested background, much in the same way as my brothers and sisters and I have developed over the years.
[03:34:31.770 --> 03:34:43.014]  But when you think about the mindset was this was the nation of total opportunity, the one oasis on the planet for freedom and liberty and justice.
[03:34:43.414 --> 03:34:43.994]  We're good to go.
[03:35:04.623 --> 03:35:25.401]  Adults would have over the radio broadcasts of the latest news and he would listen carefully and he kept detailed maps during World War II where we were and where the Axis and the Allies had moved in combat and so on both in the Pacific and in Europe and he followed all of that and it was part of the dialogue among people.
[03:35:25.421 --> 03:35:30.486]  A real conversation was happening among the people.
[03:35:31.445 --> 03:35:34.128]  For the people, by the people, of the people.
[03:35:34.168 --> 03:35:38.312]  That's the way my father grew up, understanding governance.
[03:35:38.333 --> 03:35:39.314]  And that's the way I grew up.
[03:35:39.694 --> 03:35:43.498]  And my children grow up, and my grandchildren now are growing.
[03:35:43.979 --> 03:35:53.649]  And as I look at that multi-generational overlay of what the American value system was based on, this is what we're losing presently.
[03:35:55.060 --> 03:36:04.406]  I have a couple of video clips that I pulled recently and asked the guys in the team to pull together of Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic Party.
[03:36:04.726 --> 03:36:06.528]  Now, let me roll back a little bit further.
[03:36:06.568 --> 03:36:23.439]  Now, when my dad was in the Congress in the early 70s before he disappeared, and without getting into that history today, but when he disappeared off the face of the earth, Don Young came in in a special election, Don Young, who is the longest living, longest in history serving United
[03:36:23.439 --> 03:36:23.519]  Yes.
[03:36:43.800 --> 03:36:45.121]  And I don't pick on people.
[03:36:45.161 --> 03:36:46.262]  That is not who I am.
[03:36:46.382 --> 03:36:59.672]  But I've got to say, the words coming out, the ideas that are being expressed by Nancy Pelosi in the next video clip, which deals with the concept of government, you know, in terms of how do you manipulate the news?
[03:36:59.752 --> 03:37:02.354]  How do you create the news, if you will?
[03:37:02.394 --> 03:37:06.717]  And it's a thing she ran that ran actually on C-SPAN and
[03:37:08.027 --> 03:37:09.167]  No, let's just run the clip.
[03:37:09.227 --> 03:37:10.368]  I mean, let's hear it.
[03:37:10.408 --> 03:37:13.609]  Let's go, guys, if you have that ready and we can run it.
[03:37:13.629 --> 03:37:16.370]  It's self-fulfilling.
[03:37:16.630 --> 03:37:19.871]  You demonize and then you... We call it the wrap-up smear.
[03:37:20.231 --> 03:37:22.672]  If you want to talk politics, it's called the wrap-up smear.
[03:37:22.952 --> 03:37:26.673]  You smear somebody with falsehoods and all the rest.
[03:37:27.645 --> 03:37:28.807]  And then you merchandise it.
[03:37:29.728 --> 03:37:35.215]  And then you write it, and they'll say, see it's reported in the press that this, this, this, and this.
[03:37:35.976 --> 03:37:39.761]  So they have that validation that the press reported the smear.
[03:37:40.562 --> 03:37:41.824]  And then it's called the wrap-up smear.
[03:37:41.884 --> 03:37:46.009]  Now I'm going to merchandise the press's report on the smear that we made.
[03:37:47.751 --> 03:37:48.572]  Now get that.
[03:37:49.052 --> 03:37:56.496]  I'm going to merchandise the lie that we created, that then we make into the news, is what Nancy Pelosi is saying.
[03:37:56.856 --> 03:38:03.741]  And then once it's a news story, we point at it like it's a factual story, and then just reiterate it over and over again.
[03:38:03.781 --> 03:38:05.462]  This is called propaganda.
[03:38:05.502 --> 03:38:11.165]  This is what Adolf Hitler invented in the 1930s and was the master of.
[03:38:12.339 --> 03:38:18.146]  That kind of thinking and what Nancy Pelosi refers to this as a tactic.
[03:38:19.508 --> 03:38:25.415]  A tactic to be applied for a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.
[03:38:26.856 --> 03:38:28.619]  Are you kidding me?
[03:38:29.970 --> 03:38:44.776]  My father, my grandfather, my great-grandfather are rolling over in their graves along with the founders of this nation right now, listening to that as a value statement.
[03:38:45.316 --> 03:38:53.819]  Forget about the words, forget about the whole idea that, okay, that's the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.
[03:38:55.123 --> 03:38:59.995]  A position that should be respected and respectable.
[03:39:01.639 --> 03:39:04.546]  And what are we hearing from the speaker?
[03:39:06.067 --> 03:39:14.971]  That a tactic of lying is the way of the world, and what she teaches other Democrats as their leader in the U.S.
[03:39:15.011 --> 03:39:15.332]  House.
[03:39:15.832 --> 03:39:23.156]  And this should be an affront to every citizen, regardless of your political party, in this country.
[03:39:23.696 --> 03:39:27.958]  This is not what this nation is about.
[03:39:29.279 --> 03:39:34.081]  Lying and manipulating, and how is that expressed in the last administration?
[03:39:34.986 --> 03:39:40.408]  You know, the travel for torture programs run both under Obama and his predecessor.
[03:39:40.549 --> 03:39:42.930]  Oh, we're not going to do every kind of torture.
[03:39:42.970 --> 03:39:43.890]  We'll have some new ones.
[03:39:44.510 --> 03:39:45.571]  But, you know, think about it.
[03:39:46.191 --> 03:39:49.653]  Blackmail, extortion, regime change.
[03:39:49.713 --> 03:39:51.433]  These are not American ideas.
[03:39:51.453 --> 03:39:58.296]  These are modern ideas put forward by somebody other than you and me as average citizens.
[03:39:58.837 --> 03:40:02.118]  We have been hijacked in the very leadership of these parties.
[03:40:02.738 --> 03:40:03.699]  Think they know
[03:40:04.545 --> 03:40:09.747]  Better and believe that we are so stupid that we can just be manipulated.
[03:40:09.908 --> 03:40:14.570]  There's another segment I want to run and it was during the budget conference recently in December.
[03:40:15.710 --> 03:40:23.794]  Owen and I were on talking about this but I want to run this segment on the budget and the idea of transparency as we talk about our government today.
[03:40:25.055 --> 03:40:25.895]  Can we roll that guys?
[03:40:27.346 --> 03:40:32.373]  I'm coming in in good faith to negotiate with you about how we can keep the government open.
[03:40:32.754 --> 03:40:35.839]  We're going to keep it open if we have border security.
[03:40:35.879 --> 03:40:38.442]  If we don't have border security, Chuck, we're not going to keep it open.
[03:40:38.523 --> 03:40:39.043]  I'm with you.
[03:40:39.164 --> 03:40:40.365]  We are going to have border security.
[03:40:40.385 --> 03:40:43.089]  And it's the same way you're bragging about what has been done.
[03:40:44.185 --> 03:40:47.747]  We want to do the same thing we did last year, this year.
[03:40:47.807 --> 03:40:48.787]  That's our proposal.
[03:40:48.967 --> 03:40:52.429]  If it's good then, it's good now, and it won't shut down the government.
[03:40:52.449 --> 03:40:55.070]  Chuck, we can build a much bigger section with more money.
[03:40:55.090 --> 03:40:56.851]  Let's debate in private, okay?
[03:40:56.931 --> 03:41:00.653]  Yeah, let's debate in private.
[03:41:00.693 --> 03:41:02.634]  We need border security.
[03:41:02.654 --> 03:41:04.414]  I think we all agree that we need border security.
[03:41:05.915 --> 03:41:06.856]  Now, listen to that.
[03:41:06.916 --> 03:41:08.336]  Let's do this in private.
[03:41:08.456 --> 03:41:09.877]  Let's do this in private.
[03:41:10.811 --> 03:41:15.474]  Schumer saying and Pelosi's echoing, let's do this in private.
[03:41:15.954 --> 03:41:24.219]  Let's take the people's business and shove it in a closet and light up the cigars and make the deal and ha ha ha.
[03:41:25.360 --> 03:41:27.621]  Screw America, that's what they're saying.
[03:41:29.463 --> 03:41:31.584]  That is what is being said here.
[03:41:31.784 --> 03:41:34.825]  It is about let's all hide in the closet.
[03:41:34.865 --> 03:41:35.806]  What is Donald Trump saying?
[03:41:35.826 --> 03:41:40.668]  No, no, let's do this open and let's do this in the open light of day.
[03:41:41.488 --> 03:41:46.571]  Let's have our budget discussions open for the public to actually see.
[03:41:47.191 --> 03:41:50.052]  That's what we need to all get on the phone right now.
[03:41:50.092 --> 03:41:50.512]  Look it up.
[03:41:50.973 --> 03:41:53.634]  Look up your congressman's office phone number.
[03:41:54.434 --> 03:41:55.075]  Look it up.
[03:41:55.695 --> 03:41:58.076]  Call the Capitol switchboard and say, hey,
[03:41:58.809 --> 03:42:12.053]  Before you shut this government down again, let's make sure all these so-called negotiations between the executive and the legislative branch are in the public view, not in a closet.
[03:42:13.012 --> 03:42:23.400]  Where you can then create the synthesized news, as Pelosi said, we can just lie and throw it out there and then quote it as the facts.
[03:42:23.781 --> 03:42:24.821]  And this is the problem.
[03:42:24.842 --> 03:42:29.485]  You know, I was trained as a negotiator at a point in my career.
[03:42:29.525 --> 03:42:32.388]  And one of the key elements of negotiations is honesty.
[03:42:33.528 --> 03:42:34.349]  It's about honesty.
[03:42:34.369 --> 03:42:37.872]  You got to know the guy across the table from you is telling the truth.
[03:42:38.803 --> 03:42:40.784]  At the end of the day, or they're shutting up.
[03:42:41.144 --> 03:42:42.185]  And we need the truth.
[03:42:42.625 --> 03:42:44.867]  That's what makes America free.
[03:42:45.467 --> 03:42:49.529]  That's what is the foundation of liberty and justice, is the truth.
[03:42:49.830 --> 03:42:52.911]  We're going to be right back after a few brief messages.
[03:42:52.931 --> 03:42:55.693]  This is Dr. Nick Begich with InfoWars.
[03:42:56.113 --> 03:42:58.815]  Pay attention, we're in the InfoWars.
[03:43:02.318 --> 03:43:09.684]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[03:43:10.304 --> 03:43:16.109]  And a lot of times we reach out to top companies and they don't want to private label to us because, well, we're InfoWars and we've been demonized.
[03:43:16.169 --> 03:43:20.473]  But a lot of times, people will work with us only because we're InfoWars.
[03:43:21.053 --> 03:43:36.664]  Well, there is a national company, and I'm not going to name them because we're not in competition with them, but we probably label their product, who has FDA approval for years to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there until you get to prescription level of wound gel that can be sold in stores.
[03:43:37.304 --> 03:43:44.188]  And we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[03:43:44.768 --> 03:43:46.409]  But the announcement here today is this.
[03:43:47.109 --> 03:43:50.591]  We've been selling a lot of the Wound Gel and a lot of the Immune Garment.
[03:43:51.031 --> 03:43:53.293]  In fact, we just put in big orders for both of them.
[03:43:54.073 --> 03:44:04.825]  But then I noticed without us even plugging it, because of all the scary stuff going on this winter with viruses and bacteria spreading at record levels, that it was all flying off the shelves at regular price.
[03:44:05.485 --> 03:44:11.191]  And so unlike other companies and other groups that do things like raise prices during a crisis,
[03:44:11.792 --> 03:44:20.396]  We're going to go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:44:20.856 --> 03:44:21.757]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:44:22.117 --> 03:44:26.039]  We're going to go to 40% off because I just put a big order in.
[03:44:26.339 --> 03:44:31.962]  It'll be a few months till more comes in, but I want you to have the impetus and the initiative to get it for yourself and your family.
[03:44:32.762 --> 03:44:36.104]  Get a great discount, see how great it works, and become a repeat customer.
[03:44:36.365 --> 03:44:41.048]  It's just as a Texan, and as American, and as a patriot, that's how I want to be treated.
[03:44:41.548 --> 03:44:48.833]  That when there's a crisis and people really need something and want it, I'm gonna sell it at a huge discount instead of selling it at full price because I noticed you were buying it.
[03:44:49.173 --> 03:44:59.720]  So because you're supporting us and already buying it, both the products, 40% off as a combo, or 40% off individually, while supplies last, at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:45:06.503 --> 03:45:09.806]  This is a solution for you and your family.
[03:45:10.106 --> 03:45:14.990]  This is something guaranteed, like oxygen and water, to sustain life.
[03:45:15.190 --> 03:45:16.891]  There are a bunch of bad halogens.
[03:45:17.011 --> 03:45:20.714]  There is one good halogen in the body, and it's pure atomic iodine.
[03:45:20.854 --> 03:45:22.876]  Most forms are bound, so you don't absorb them.
[03:45:22.936 --> 03:45:34.004]  But even microscopic amounts of the broken-down type are better than nothing, because your body recognizes it and takes it on, and tries to use it instead of bromine, chloride, fluorine, and the other bad ones.
[03:45:34.324 --> 03:45:36.965]  And there's a lot of things better than just wealth in this world.
[03:45:37.085 --> 03:45:38.186]  How about physical wealth?
[03:45:38.526 --> 03:45:40.567]  When I forget to take my iodine, I'm an idiot.
[03:45:41.087 --> 03:45:42.148]  We have X2.
[03:45:42.228 --> 03:45:47.510]  It's selling out because a company tried to put me over the barrel from the oil well company that drills to get it at 12,000 feet.
[03:45:47.951 --> 03:45:49.471]  We ended up finding an even better company.
[03:45:49.651 --> 03:45:55.654]  Their chemist said, you can put this in the way you have it, but you should add a little bit of vitamin C to stabilize it so it doesn't oxidize.
[03:45:55.774 --> 03:45:57.195]  And this other form of iodine
[03:45:57.375 --> 03:45:59.497]  And then we've got the New York Times.
[03:45:59.517 --> 03:46:01.559]  Now, again, this is from 12 years ago.
[03:46:14.651 --> 03:46:17.012]  Raising the world's IQ, the secret is salt.
[03:46:17.092 --> 03:46:17.533]  But it's not.
[03:46:17.553 --> 03:46:20.714]  It says right here, adding ionized iodine to the salt.
[03:46:20.794 --> 03:46:23.696]  Boosted IQ, 10 to 20 points, increased fertility.
[03:46:23.796 --> 03:46:27.158]  They put it in the water the kids are given at school in China.
[03:46:27.458 --> 03:46:28.318]  Why do I say that?
[03:46:28.418 --> 03:46:41.425]  Because in the 20s, we had major reproductive problems, major deformities, major retardation, major IQ reduction, not on the coastal areas where people got fresh fish that had some iodine in it, but in the Midwest.
[03:46:41.445 --> 03:46:43.166]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:18.835 --> 03:47:25.157]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:25.697 --> 03:47:29.358]  And now, your host, Nick Begich.
[03:47:32.618 --> 03:47:33.619]  And welcome back.
[03:47:33.799 --> 03:47:35.499]  And this is Nick Begich.
[03:47:35.559 --> 03:47:43.641]  And, you know, the theme of today's show, in fact, the title I told the guys to put on it was A Heritage in the Republic.
[03:47:44.454 --> 03:47:47.676]  You know, I mean, I come from immigrant roots.
[03:47:48.016 --> 03:47:56.582]  I'm a second generation American, like many out there on my father's side, third generation on my mother's side.
[03:47:56.602 --> 03:48:08.529]  And, you know, when I think about just the change in the way people's attitudes are towards not just immigration in general, but the attitude of immigrants when they arrive is so different.
[03:48:08.569 --> 03:48:10.010]  And it varies with individuals.
[03:48:10.090 --> 03:48:10.971]  I have to say that.
[03:48:11.937 --> 03:48:22.252]  In all fairness, I mean, I think when you come in the front door and you get to arrive here and be a part of what the United States is and what it's becoming,
[03:48:23.341 --> 03:48:30.287]  It is a privilege, an honor to be welcomed into a country through the front door.
[03:48:30.607 --> 03:48:36.291]  And, you know, and maybe we need to look at those statutes a little closer and see what's happening there.
[03:48:36.331 --> 03:48:38.613]  And I think that's not always a bad idea.
[03:48:38.633 --> 03:48:40.234]  They need to be reviewed from time to time.
[03:48:40.274 --> 03:48:42.616]  But in the meanwhile, we need to have secure borders.
[03:48:43.320 --> 03:48:50.264]  What I was talking about in sort of the whole governance backdrop, again, you know, think about this in terms of the changes.
[03:48:50.304 --> 03:48:58.348]  The political party of my dad, the Democratic Party, is now a party about non-citizens, which is kind of awkward, you know.
[03:48:58.368 --> 03:49:07.053]  My dad, as a first-generation American, would have weighed in heavily on this because he valued the thoughts of immigration and what the country was founded on and how we built it.
[03:49:07.994 --> 03:49:10.775]  You know, Irish were treated badly when they arrived.
[03:49:10.875 --> 03:49:12.036]  The Italians were treated
[03:49:12.076 --> 03:49:13.377]  Badly when they arrived.
[03:49:13.897 --> 03:49:19.761]  You know, every group, when they arrived in mass from the various parts of Europe and the world, they were treated badly.
[03:49:21.743 --> 03:49:38.715]  That is not an excuse for what can happen today, but the biggest incoming group are Latin American descent, and the majority population in the United States is Latin American descent these days, so I don't think the same unwelcome situation is here at all.
[03:49:39.816 --> 03:49:41.137]  In fact, I think it's the opposite.
[03:49:41.157 --> 03:49:43.060]  I think America has evolved beyond that.
[03:49:43.100 --> 03:49:45.563]  It's not about race or nationality or any of it.
[03:49:45.983 --> 03:49:58.278]  It's just about honoring the law and the things that built a nation, which is a commonality, a melting pot of things that evolved from people out into our government, expressed in a set of values.
[03:49:58.798 --> 03:50:02.002]  That really has been hijacked, and that's what I'm talking about here today.
[03:50:02.423 --> 03:50:05.106]  The idea that the people's business should be in a closet.
[03:50:05.707 --> 03:50:10.392]  And these are the parties that talk about transparency in government.
[03:50:11.033 --> 03:50:13.076]  A nice name, but not in reality.
[03:50:13.136 --> 03:50:15.438]  The only transparency is about you and me.
[03:50:15.518 --> 03:50:18.182]  The only cameras pointed at anyone are at us.
[03:50:19.511 --> 03:50:20.392]  We're good to go.
[03:50:40.496 --> 03:50:43.317]  Nazi Germany and the rise of fascism.
[03:50:43.437 --> 03:50:53.180]  And it's when government uses the tools of propaganda and lying, as Nancy Pelosi said, we played in the last segment, as a policy, as a tactic.
[03:50:53.560 --> 03:51:06.683]  And then you overlay the interest of pharmaceutical industry and corporations and the wealthy and the elite, whether you're a Democrat proposing to be a representative of poor, innocent masses or Republican.
[03:51:06.703 --> 03:51:08.344]  You know, these guys have stolen
[03:51:08.931 --> 03:51:11.212]  From us, this republic.
[03:51:12.052 --> 03:51:13.292]  And that's what needs to be returned.
[03:51:13.332 --> 03:51:19.454]  Not in an act of violence and craziness like we're seeing from the left, the insanity of it all.
[03:51:19.474 --> 03:51:28.317]  Because by identity politics, you abrogate the melting pot, the co-culture that we've created here, as unique in the world.
[03:51:28.537 --> 03:51:32.298]  And you burn it on the ground, the flag.
[03:51:32.378 --> 03:51:33.358]  Now, this is not
[03:51:34.649 --> 03:51:39.150]  How Americans and future Americans used to arrive in the nation.
[03:51:39.190 --> 03:51:43.110]  And I think that is fundamentally the flaw here.
[03:51:43.130 --> 03:51:47.171]  It's a value system that we need to respect.
[03:51:48.011 --> 03:51:49.051]  And justice for all.
[03:51:49.112 --> 03:51:51.332]  I want to talk about that foundation.
[03:51:51.352 --> 03:51:54.192]  Because we hear a lot about socialism too these days.
[03:51:54.592 --> 03:51:57.633]  Socialize medicine, socialize this, socialize that.
[03:51:58.373 --> 03:52:00.333]  You know, think about justice.
[03:52:00.353 --> 03:52:03.514]  If you're going to socialize anything in this country, how about justice?
[03:52:04.859 --> 03:52:14.655]  Access to the court system on an equal footing, where you don't have to sacrifice everything you own for an increment of justice.
[03:52:15.536 --> 03:52:15.796]  Right?
[03:52:16.277 --> 03:52:18.521]  I mean, what's Alex facing right now?
[03:52:18.621 --> 03:52:19.903]  Millions in litigation.
[03:52:20.703 --> 03:52:32.245]  To just have the right of free speech and his right to be heard, our right to be heard in the world and invigorate the public debate in the world, which is what a free press is about.
[03:52:32.345 --> 03:52:33.986]  It's not silencing speech.
[03:52:34.506 --> 03:52:36.206]  It's making sure speech happens.
[03:52:36.826 --> 03:52:46.208]  It's making sure the electronic town square of the 21st century is open for everyone, not just those with the approved ideas.
[03:52:47.160 --> 03:52:49.922]  This is not what this republic is about.
[03:52:50.342 --> 03:52:55.986]  And I can tell you my dad would be opposed to so much of the ideas that are expressed in this network.
[03:52:56.186 --> 03:52:57.987]  But I know one thing about my dad.
[03:52:58.688 --> 03:53:10.255]  He would fight to the death for my right and Alex's right and everybody else's right to the opportunity to speak freely about these ideas.
[03:53:10.922 --> 03:53:32.307]  Because that's the kind of man he was because it was about values first and ideas were the realm of public discussion debate where either he was going to become enlightened and change his view and he did on a lot of issues over his career because he gained information and understood it and then he could make a different decision because it filled in the blanks.
[03:53:32.787 --> 03:53:37.048]  He was a great debater because he listened for the holes.
[03:53:37.288 --> 03:53:38.688]  Where was information missing?
[03:53:39.486 --> 03:53:42.929]  Or where was the information I needed to contribute lacking?
[03:53:43.529 --> 03:53:44.770]  So a dialogue could happen.
[03:53:44.811 --> 03:53:47.853]  I want to talk about how the Congress was configured in the early 70s.
[03:53:48.494 --> 03:53:51.616]  In those days, families all went to D.C.
[03:53:51.656 --> 03:53:55.059]  and we lived in either Maryland or Northern Virginia or on the Hill.
[03:53:55.679 --> 03:53:58.802]  And families got together for events like all the time.
[03:53:59.402 --> 03:54:02.525]  And they were Republican families and Democratic families all together.
[03:54:03.337 --> 03:54:10.222]  And it's awful hard to look children in the eye and to look families in the eye and then beat each other up all day.
[03:54:10.942 --> 03:54:11.983]  So you didn't do that.
[03:54:12.203 --> 03:54:14.425]  You treated people with dignity and respect.
[03:54:14.845 --> 03:54:25.772]  The respect that if you believe human beings are created in the image and likeness of God, that we're somehow divinely connected to the Creator, you would do anyway, right?
[03:54:25.952 --> 03:54:28.574]  I mean, isn't that the way we should treat each other?
[03:54:28.814 --> 03:54:32.297]  As with respect and dignity, even when we strongly disagree.
[03:54:33.695 --> 03:54:43.482]  Can't we embrace each other in a way that Christ did, where he even embraced prostitutes and the poor and the dirty and the filthy and the diseased?
[03:54:44.382 --> 03:54:52.007]  You know, can't we look at our adversaries with the same compassion and yet recognition of our differences and be respectful of one another?
[03:54:52.087 --> 03:54:52.928]  I believe we can.
[03:54:53.920 --> 03:54:55.100]  In my family, we do.
[03:54:55.160 --> 03:54:57.861]  There's Republicans and there's Democrats and there's Libertarians.
[03:54:58.181 --> 03:55:01.222]  And there's everything in between and everything outside of that.
[03:55:01.342 --> 03:55:06.203]  And we debate like crazy on the facts and the merit of the debate.
[03:55:06.963 --> 03:55:09.483]  And we change and we modify and we grow in that debate.
[03:55:10.443 --> 03:55:11.544]  And it's vigorous.
[03:55:11.964 --> 03:55:12.724]  It's emotional.
[03:55:12.764 --> 03:55:18.525]  But when we leave, we embrace each other as brothers and sisters.
[03:55:18.565 --> 03:55:19.405]  And it's a model.
[03:55:20.085 --> 03:55:22.866]  It's a model for how the nation should behave.
[03:55:23.712 --> 03:55:24.212]  Debate.
[03:55:25.614 --> 03:55:26.454]  Vigorously debate.
[03:55:26.494 --> 03:55:28.156]  Don't shut anybody's channel off.
[03:55:28.796 --> 03:55:30.898]  You can always change it if you don't like what you're hearing.
[03:55:31.338 --> 03:55:32.659]  But let's have the debate.
[03:55:32.719 --> 03:55:35.101]  And let's have it on a platform of facts and ideas.
[03:55:35.542 --> 03:55:38.684]  And not be beating each other up, personalizing it.
[03:55:38.744 --> 03:55:39.805]  That doesn't take us anywhere.
[03:55:39.825 --> 03:55:42.327]  And that does not enlighten the listening public.
[03:55:42.387 --> 03:55:44.929]  You that need this information right now.
[03:55:45.009 --> 03:55:49.593]  So we can take our government back and gain the command and control of government again.
[03:55:49.653 --> 03:55:52.135]  Because the voting booth is still working for the moment.
[03:55:53.208 --> 03:56:10.861]  For the moment, a technocracy does not need electronic voting, should be opposed, not allowed at all, ever, under any condition, you should be able to pull that paper ballot with the ink mark on it and count them individually or ever.
[03:56:12.162 --> 03:56:18.467]  Because that's what's missing is the integrity of the process, starting with the voting booth.
[03:56:19.107 --> 03:56:21.049]  Kill the technology on the voting booth.
[03:56:22.109 --> 03:56:22.570]  Secondly,
[03:56:23.399 --> 03:56:24.979]  Kill the money in politics.
[03:56:25.059 --> 03:56:26.980]  Corporations are not living souls.
[03:56:27.520 --> 03:56:29.661]  We need a constitutional amendment that says so.
[03:56:30.281 --> 03:56:38.463]  That doesn't give them the right to run elections and contribute enormous sums of money in any way they want to influence political outcomes.
[03:56:38.903 --> 03:56:43.505]  It is not a government for corporations, by corporations, period.
[03:56:43.985 --> 03:56:44.985]  It's about people.
[03:56:45.885 --> 03:56:46.925]  Living souls.
[03:56:47.446 --> 03:56:48.466]  Human beings.
[03:56:49.421 --> 03:56:49.561]  Us.
[03:56:50.302 --> 03:56:52.663]  Sovereign human beings.
[03:56:52.903 --> 03:56:56.104]  And that's what needs to be protected, because that is what is enshrined.
[03:56:56.785 --> 03:57:09.211]  We need to rethink in the 21st century the concepts of privacy, liberty, and justice, and make sure they're applied in this century to living souls, not dead, lifeless corporations.
[03:57:10.123 --> 03:57:13.286]  That have nothing but the bottom line at stake.
[03:57:13.466 --> 03:57:14.487]  Greed at stake.
[03:57:14.607 --> 03:57:15.368]  Money at stake.
[03:57:15.408 --> 03:57:19.412]  Because that's their fiduciary legal responsibility.
[03:57:19.452 --> 03:57:21.754]  And the only one most of them have.
[03:57:22.364 --> 03:57:23.565]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:57:23.585 --> 03:57:24.525]  This is InfoWars.
[03:57:24.545 --> 03:57:26.386]  I always forget to mention my website.
[03:57:26.886 --> 03:57:27.527]  EarthPulse.
[03:57:27.827 --> 03:57:29.808]  E-A-R-T-H-P-U-L-S-E.
[03:57:29.908 --> 03:57:31.169]  EarthPulse.com.
[03:57:31.649 --> 03:57:32.429]  Check us out.
[03:57:33.250 --> 03:57:35.411]  I'm here every other Friday.
[03:57:35.451 --> 03:57:37.792]  We try to be on with you guys, and we appreciate it.
[03:57:38.052 --> 03:57:40.713]  We appreciate InfoWars, everything the team is doing.
[03:57:41.014 --> 03:57:43.955]  We appreciate Alex and the fight that he is in.
[03:57:44.315 --> 03:57:47.937]  Support this network now at 5 minutes to midnight.
[03:57:48.277 --> 03:57:49.178]  This is the 11th hour.
[03:57:52.881 --> 03:58:00.227]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best selling, highest rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[03:58:00.867 --> 03:58:06.672]  And a lot of times we reach out to top companies and they don't want to private label to us because, well, we're InfoWars and we've been demonized.
[03:58:06.732 --> 03:58:11.036]  But a lot of times, people will work with us only because we're InfoWars.
[03:58:11.616 --> 03:58:27.210]  Well, there is a national company, and I'm not going to name them because we're not in competition with them, but we probably label the product, who has FDA approval for years to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there until you get to prescription level of wound gel that can be sold in stores.
[03:58:27.870 --> 03:58:34.734]  And we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[03:58:35.335 --> 03:58:36.955]  But the announcement here today is this.
[03:58:37.656 --> 03:58:41.138]  We've been selling a lot of the Wombshell and a lot of the Immune Garden.
[03:58:41.578 --> 03:58:43.860]  In fact, we just put in big orders for both of them.
[03:58:44.620 --> 03:58:55.377]  But then I noticed without us even plugging it because of all the scary stuff going on this winter with viruses and bacteria spreading at record levels, that it was all flying off the shelves at regular price.
[03:58:56.058 --> 03:58:59.564]  And so unlike other companies and other groups that do things like
