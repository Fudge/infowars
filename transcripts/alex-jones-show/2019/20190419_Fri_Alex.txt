[00:00:05.347 --> 00:00:06.088]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.488 --> 00:00:07.749]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.409]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.611]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:13.012]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.532 --> 00:00:18.195]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:24.522]  So after two long years, here we are.
[00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:26.604]  It's hard to believe that any of it actually happened.
[00:00:26.644 --> 00:00:32.568]  Looking back, it was two years of unremitting, never-diminishing hysteria about Russia.
[00:00:33.128 --> 00:00:43.035]  It was a continuous wave of panic and superstition over unseen Slavic interference, all stoked by the very people we're told are the most rational in our society.
[00:00:43.795 --> 00:00:48.101]  For two years, our capital city became a kind of massive CNN panel.
[00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:54.310]  A living monument to ignorance and dishonesty, where the loudest and the dumbest invariably got the most attention.
[00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.080]  We just lived through two full years of that.
[00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:07.604]  Screaming, threatening, surveillance, character assassination, loyalty tests, wild allegations of treason and spying and betrayal from office holders.
[00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:13.686]  Innocent people find themselves afraid to go to dinner, scared to send text messages or talk on the phone.
[00:01:14.426 --> 00:01:17.711]  For two years, we lived in an all-pervasive cult of personality.
[00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:22.799]  Our leaders worshipped a 74-year-old federal prosecutor who almost never spoke in public.
[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.223]  He alone was good, they told us.
[00:01:25.623 --> 00:01:27.186]  Only they could interpret his will.
[00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:29.564]  It was all thoroughly bizarre.
[00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:32.425]  Demented, really, though nobody said so at the time.
[00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:33.646]  They were too afraid.
[00:01:34.346 --> 00:01:37.507]  It seems like a dream now, which, actually, it was.
[00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:38.587]  None of it was real.
[00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:40.848]  Nobody colluded with Vladimir Putin.
[00:01:41.228 --> 00:01:46.589]  Nobody changed vote totals or met secretly in Prague or at a pee tape, whatever that is.
[00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:49.050]  There was never a Russia conspiracy.
[00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.972]  Hillary Clinton wasn't robbed of her rightful position by Julian Assange or Roger Stone or anyone else.
[00:01:55.512 --> 00:01:59.634]  Hillary lost the election because she was an entitled boor who didn't run on anything.
[00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.416]  In the end, that's what Robert Mueller proved.
[00:02:03.396 --> 00:02:04.757]  The news anchors couldn't handle that.
[00:02:04.777 --> 00:02:06.017]  They couldn't handle that conclusion.
[00:02:06.478 --> 00:02:09.679]  It was too far from what they'd promised their audiences for so long.
[00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:11.620]  They were too invested in the lies.
[00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:16.743]  When the report arrived in Congress this morning, they found themselves reduced to huffing and sputtering.
[00:02:17.123 --> 00:02:18.824]  They couldn't admit what was in the report.
[00:02:19.464 --> 00:02:22.846]  Well, they told us, Robert Mueller didn't exonerate President Trump.
[00:02:23.885 --> 00:02:24.065]  Okay.
[00:02:24.445 --> 00:02:27.227]  I mean, that may be true, but only theologically.
[00:02:27.727 --> 00:02:30.188]  Mueller doesn't have the power to absolve sin.
[00:02:30.288 --> 00:02:31.189]  Only God can.
[00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.011]  But in every other sense, Mueller's report was exculpatory.
[00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:41.254]  If dozens of federal prosecutors spent two years trying to charge you with the crime, and then found they couldn't,
[00:02:42.034 --> 00:02:44.316]  It would mean there wasn't any real evidence you did it.
[00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:45.797]  And that's what happened here.
[00:02:46.377 --> 00:02:50.560]  You may not like Donald Trump, but that's what we just learned from the Mueller report.
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.682]  You would have to be a mindless partisan to deny it.
[00:02:54.303 --> 00:02:57.265]  A lot of news anchors turn out to be mindless partisans.
[00:02:57.925 --> 00:03:01.588]  When the facts contravene the interests of their party, they deny the facts.
[00:03:01.988 --> 00:03:05.610]  Then they attack anyone who persists in stating the obvious out loud.
[00:03:06.826 --> 00:03:18.071]  So suddenly the very same people who lied to you for two years about Russia are demanding that under no circumstances are you allowed to believe anything that the Attorney General Bill Barr might say.
[00:03:18.811 --> 00:03:21.492]  Sure, Barr may look like a conventional Republican.
[00:03:21.712 --> 00:03:23.673]  He was a Jeb Bush donor and everything.
[00:03:24.193 --> 00:03:27.895]  And he does appear to be a close personal friend of Robert Mueller's.
[00:03:28.995 --> 00:03:30.376]  But that's why he's so tricky.
[00:03:31.076 --> 00:03:32.036]  It's all a ruse.
[00:03:32.256 --> 00:03:35.698]  In fact, Barr is a Putin stooge like all the rest.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.205]  If you look at his behavior, it is not that of a geriatric.
[00:03:43.425 --> 00:03:45.327]  It is that of a partisan.
[00:03:45.527 --> 00:03:46.828]  This looks like an inside job.
[00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:52.233]  We shouldn't take anything that Barr says tomorrow as anything other than performative coonery.
[00:03:52.754 --> 00:03:54.816]  Is Barr the president's new fix?
[00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:56.597]  The answer to that seems to be yes.
[00:03:56.877 --> 00:04:03.844]  But he becomes the first cabinet secretary to plunge into the deep end of Trump's conspiracy pool.
[00:04:04.833 --> 00:04:09.717]  I don't normally start the broadcast with somebody else's show, but Tucker Carlson hit such a hole-in-one there.
[00:04:10.738 --> 00:04:11.539]  You've got to do it.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.506]  I've really had time to reflect on what's unfolding, and we've got some really good news concerning the Mueller report.
[00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:22.709]  We've got some really bad news that I'm going to break down on the other side.
[00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.733]  And then we've got the former head of the Border Patrol, the former head of ICE,
[00:04:28.683 --> 00:04:36.167]  And a whole bunch of other former leaders coming out and saying, listen, this is five, ten times worse than anything we've ever seen.
[00:04:36.688 --> 00:04:38.088]  Our border has collapsed.
[00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.290]  Former DEA head says U.S.
[00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.511]  border collapsing.
[00:04:43.311 --> 00:04:44.892]  That means the country's collapsing.
[00:04:45.673 --> 00:04:46.693]  And think about the Democrats.
[00:04:47.434 --> 00:04:49.695]  Up until two weeks ago, they said there was no border crisis.
[00:04:50.155 --> 00:04:51.976]  And a few months ago, killed funding for it.
[00:04:52.877 --> 00:04:53.237]  Remember?
[00:04:53.938 --> 00:04:55.038]  Killed the funding.
[00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:56.459]  Ha!
[00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:57.380]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:09.519]  Here you have a president who I can tell you and guarantee you is in collusion with the Russians.
[00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:11.860]  I say that he was in collusion with Putin.
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.021]  I believe that there really has been collusion.
[00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:16.843]  I say that he was in collusion with the Kremlin.
[00:05:17.003 --> 00:05:25.227]  I am so depending on our special counsel, Robert Mueller, to connect the dots, to connect those dots, connect the dots, dots, dots.
[00:05:25.848 --> 00:05:29.552]  The dots are getting closer.
[00:05:29.632 --> 00:05:31.915]  If there was collusion, we'll get to collusion.
[00:05:31.975 --> 00:05:34.437]  I have my hopes for Mueller as most people do.
[00:05:34.598 --> 00:05:39.243]  I think it's going to be proven that if Mueller does his job, I believe there was collusion.
[00:05:39.423 --> 00:05:41.065]  And collusion will lead to impeachment.
[00:05:41.105 --> 00:05:42.767]  This is going to lead right to impeachment.
[00:05:42.927 --> 00:05:43.187]  Big Brother.
[00:06:13.035 --> 00:06:14.256]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:15.817 --> 00:06:16.917]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:18.398 --> 00:06:19.379]  You want answers?
[00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:22.140]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:22.241 --> 00:06:28.544]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:35.448 --> 00:06:36.329]  They're having a good day.
[00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:37.570]  I'm having a good day, too.
[00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.392]  It was called No Collusion, No Obstruction.
[00:06:51.222 --> 00:06:53.295]  There never was, by the way, and there never will be.
[00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.812]  And we do have to get to the bottom of these things, I will say.
[00:06:57.912 --> 00:07:00.453]  And this should never happen.
[00:07:00.993 --> 00:07:08.737]  I say this in front of my friends, wounded warriors, and I just call them warriors because we just shook hands and they look great.
[00:07:09.218 --> 00:07:11.619]  They look so good, so beautiful.
[00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:17.142]  But I say it in front of my friends, this should never happen to another president again.
[00:07:18.002 --> 00:07:21.184]  This hoax, it should never happen to another president again.
[00:07:24.401 --> 00:07:25.541]  Well, the fight is on.
[00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:28.242]  If you're a radio listener, I would direct you to DrudgeReport.com.
[00:07:28.302 --> 00:07:38.106]  You can see it, a big image of the 400 plus pages put beside each other with the areas that are redacted standing out.
[00:07:40.826 --> 00:07:48.449]  And you know, President Trump does have a soft place in his heart for soldiers and sailors and Marines and people that put it all on the line.
[00:07:49.793 --> 00:07:51.795]  He's a fan of people that take action.
[00:07:52.635 --> 00:07:53.796]  He's a fan of humanity.
[00:07:53.836 --> 00:07:55.438]  That's why the globalists don't like Trump.
[00:07:56.118 --> 00:07:58.420]  They're telling us we're in the post-male and female era.
[00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:01.322]  This is the world where the beta cucks rule.
[00:08:02.063 --> 00:08:03.524]  Well, not so fast.
[00:08:04.545 --> 00:08:14.913]  So, I've had time to read over the report last night and today, and it's exactly
[00:08:16.499 --> 00:08:20.301]  What I thought was going to come out in the report even back six months ago.
[00:08:21.722 --> 00:08:22.962]  Because Trump stood up.
[00:08:23.923 --> 00:08:25.063]  Congressman Nunes stood up.
[00:08:26.644 --> 00:08:27.684]  Senator Paul stood up.
[00:08:29.185 --> 00:08:30.106]  Jim Jordan stood up.
[00:08:30.126 --> 00:08:31.246]  You, the audience, stood up.
[00:08:32.827 --> 00:08:33.867]  Tucker Carlson stood up.
[00:08:33.987 --> 00:08:34.948]  Sean Hannity stood up.
[00:08:37.069 --> 00:08:37.509]  I stood up.
[00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:38.710]  Our crew stood up.
[00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:40.350]  Owen Schroer stood up.
[00:08:40.391 --> 00:08:41.111]  David Knight stood up.
[00:08:42.984 --> 00:08:44.485]  And we all got called Russian agents.
[00:08:45.186 --> 00:08:49.069]  And some of us got investigated, and some of us got harassed, and some of us had our bank accounts taken away.
[00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.871]  I'm still listed.
[00:08:50.891 --> 00:08:52.612]  We're gonna probably have to file the lawsuit next month.
[00:08:55.815 --> 00:08:56.856]  By G2 in Boston.
[00:08:57.897 --> 00:08:58.457]  As a terrorist.
[00:09:00.159 --> 00:09:00.900]  As a money launderer.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.421]  As a criminal.
[00:09:04.042 --> 00:09:04.923]  No judge, no jury.
[00:09:05.323 --> 00:09:06.484]  That's just what the bankers do.
[00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:08.426]  That's what the White Shoe Boys do.
[00:09:09.587 --> 00:09:10.468]  They think it's all funny.
[00:09:12.381 --> 00:09:24.010]  When they're the traitors selling out the country, they're the globalists, and then they turn around and say, people that love this country, have nothing but records of standing up for it, that we're the ones that have to be watched.
[00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:34.419]  How do you flip the script when you're a bunch of traitorous globalists who want to get rid of the country, and say you want to get rid of it, and are collapsing its borders and fighting the president trying to defend the borders?
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.844]  What do you do to try to put that in check when it's so obvious you're the enemy?
[00:09:42.068 --> 00:09:46.431]  Of the unborn, and the born, and the left wants to euthanize old people.
[00:09:46.691 --> 00:09:47.992]  I mean, they're just villains!
[00:09:50.514 --> 00:09:53.416]  Teaching people that if you want to get ahead, somebody else has to lose.
[00:09:53.436 --> 00:09:56.778]  Instead of building economies that are about really taking care of people.
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.241]  They're evil.
[00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:06.045]  So, I've got some good news and some bad news about the Mueller Report.
[00:10:08.026 --> 00:10:10.428]  But I can tell you this, it's definitely bittersweet.
[00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:15.603]  Or it's sweet on the tip of your tongue and sour going down.
[00:10:16.384 --> 00:10:21.147]  Because the criminals that did all this are walking free and are so arrogant.
[00:10:21.247 --> 00:10:24.930]  They're calling for new investigations and new congressional witch hunts.
[00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:28.633]  And they're up on their hind legs, more arrogant than ever.
[00:10:28.893 --> 00:10:34.077]  Saying this is a blueprint for impeachment and proof of the Russian takeover.
[00:10:35.818 --> 00:10:36.919]  They've only gotten more arrogant.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.543]  And they have been kicking me in the gut.
[00:10:43.294 --> 00:10:45.095]  Hard for about three years.
[00:10:46.997 --> 00:10:53.822]  I mean, folks, if I told you the stuff that I'm not going to get into for a lot of reasons that they've done to me, I'm not saying I'm a victim.
[00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:54.362]  I'm a target.
[00:10:54.783 --> 00:10:59.006]  But let me tell you, these are criminals and they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:11:00.287 --> 00:11:01.808]  But of course, they're globalist traitors.
[00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:07.973]  They're the globalist boarding party to lower the drawbridge and run up the white flag.
[00:11:08.053 --> 00:11:09.214]  They're the enemy.
[00:11:11.647 --> 00:11:20.113]  And you go, if you have the most powerful, richest country in the world with the best military, and incredible resources, why would you sell it out to the chi-coms?
[00:11:20.653 --> 00:11:24.196]  I mean, even from a global domination view, you wouldn't do that.
[00:11:24.256 --> 00:11:27.838]  But see, there's a spirit that wants to bring down America.
[00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:31.461]  So a lot of the people saying no to globalism right now aren't even good guys.
[00:11:32.362 --> 00:11:38.986]  They just don't have the pure anti-Christ spirit of, why would we kill babies after they're born?
[00:11:39.066 --> 00:11:40.627]  Why would we give up all our power?
[00:11:41.914 --> 00:11:42.114]  See?
[00:11:46.299 --> 00:11:52.024]  Why would we let lesser men and women like Clinton and Cuomo rule us?
[00:11:52.084 --> 00:11:53.506]  And see, that's the globalist big problem.
[00:11:55.509 --> 00:12:10.316]  Created separation of powers so that you wouldn't have too much power concentrate one place but also so powerful people would battle with each other over power instead of consolidating power and Attacking little people so while they're distracted battling over power.
[00:12:10.636 --> 00:12:13.337]  We can build a civilization our forebears were
[00:12:14.696 --> 00:12:22.163]  Imminently intelligent, imminently educated in the real school of the world, but also in letters.
[00:12:22.864 --> 00:12:27.628]  And they were also divinely touched with divine inspiration.
[00:12:27.668 --> 00:12:28.909]  There's no doubting it.
[00:12:31.011 --> 00:12:34.415]  And we stand on the foundation they built against these enemies.
[00:12:35.896 --> 00:12:39.660]  The controlled globalist collaborator press, the big mega banks, Hollywood.
[00:12:40.871 --> 00:12:50.836]  that spews the most debilitating, demoralizing, anti-human crap the world's ever seen at our people 24-7.
[00:12:53.658 --> 00:13:08.486]  Communist China has a controlling stake in all six major Hollywood production houses, studios, and almost all of our films are banned that they're actually financing in China.
[00:13:09.986 --> 00:13:13.628]  Unless they're government-approved by China, then China always saves the day.
[00:13:13.648 --> 00:13:15.049]  The communists always save the day.
[00:13:15.309 --> 00:13:17.190]  Think about how far down the rat hole we are.
[00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:25.354]  That they're financing family-destroying, economy-destroying mental illness.
[00:13:25.574 --> 00:13:27.435]  They're teaching mental illness in Hollywood.
[00:13:27.835 --> 00:13:28.515]  In the whole culture.
[00:13:29.076 --> 00:13:29.496]  On record.
[00:13:29.516 --> 00:13:30.356]  It's come out in WikiLeaks.
[00:13:31.217 --> 00:13:37.240]  And a foreign enemy is financing that.
[00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:43.444]  Think about that.
[00:13:44.525 --> 00:13:46.206]  And then Trump says, America's good.
[00:13:46.287 --> 00:13:47.167]  The people are good.
[00:13:48.248 --> 00:13:48.969]  We're strong.
[00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:50.049]  We believe in each other.
[00:13:50.109 --> 00:13:51.430]  And they go, he's the enemy!
[00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:52.051]  Get rid of him!
[00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:54.272]  Because he's not demoralizing you.
[00:13:54.593 --> 00:13:59.516]  It's such an easy choice that Trump is good, the globalists are bad.
[00:13:59.696 --> 00:14:01.037]  It's obvious he's real.
[00:14:01.077 --> 00:14:02.198]  That's why the globalists are so pissed.
[00:14:02.539 --> 00:14:08.123]  But I'll tell you, Trump's backed by a lot of people who are Machiavellian, but they're still human.
[00:14:09.022 --> 00:14:12.805]  They have a little secret pride in America because their granddaddy was proud of it.
[00:14:13.966 --> 00:14:21.213]  Even though they've sold out to the globalists, even though they're evil in ways, they have that sin like Darth Vader of still caring about their family.
[00:14:24.636 --> 00:14:27.058]  They're not completely turned over to madness.
[00:14:33.223 --> 00:14:43.208]  Yes, it's the good people of this nation, loving, hard-working, dedicated men and women of every race, color, and creed that are the blood of this nation, and the guts, and the eyes, and the ears.
[00:14:44.208 --> 00:15:01.436]  But remember the other secret ingredient of powerful elites that are saying, why would we feed America headfirst into a woodchipper to satisfy some globalist pissing contest to mount our head on a wall?
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.583]  It will be America that doesn't mount your head on a wall, globalist.
[00:15:09.144 --> 00:15:17.711]  It will be America that overtakes you, defeats your sick ideas, and launches humanity beyond the stars.
[00:15:18.391 --> 00:15:20.493]  Beyond the stars.
[00:15:21.394 --> 00:15:28.599]  We're going to have scientific breakthroughs, the beginnings of which have already happened, where we're going to leap in human development and human understanding
[00:15:29.693 --> 00:15:33.234]  Two levels you can't even imagine, and the globalists know this?
[00:15:33.955 --> 00:15:36.836]  And their lord, their master, is very old.
[00:15:37.816 --> 00:15:40.877]  And knows that we are about to enter the next level.
[00:15:41.857 --> 00:15:43.438]  And they are screaming with anger.
[00:15:43.458 --> 00:15:48.760]  Because we are so majestic compared to them.
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.681]  We are so beautiful.
[00:15:52.247 --> 00:15:55.450]  Prepare to fight for the future of humanity.
[00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.152]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:15:57.612 --> 00:16:02.737]  This is The Infowar.
[00:16:05.239 --> 00:16:06.961]  Please don't forget, we have...

[00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:11.977]  We still have store-wide free shipping.
[00:16:12.197 --> 00:16:14.557]  We had to end all those big discounts on the supplements.
[00:16:14.577 --> 00:16:20.458]  We're about to sell out of all of them, but we still have a big discount going, even though it's about to sell out on DNA Force, our flagship amazing product.
[00:16:20.538 --> 00:16:22.318]  Check out DNA Force and learn why it's so amazing.

[00:17:10.009 --> 00:17:12.250]  I don't claim to be some Pharisee up here on a high horse.
[00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:12.970]  It's perfect.
[00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.190]  But I love God and I love Christ.
[00:17:15.111 --> 00:17:16.131]  And we're not tax exempt.
[00:17:16.151 --> 00:17:17.112]  The government can't regulate us.
[00:17:17.692 --> 00:17:25.855]  But when you buy a book, you buy a video, you buy a t-shirt, you buy coffee every month, you buy toothpaste every month, you buy stuff like protein bars every month on auto ship.

[00:17:30.436 --> 00:17:34.978]  You can tithe a little bit of profit we make on each one to fund this operation.
[00:17:36.283 --> 00:17:39.264]  Push us into the black, and help us stand in the face of the globalists.
[00:17:39.284 --> 00:17:47.488]  So please, a lot of the great losers have done this, and we salute them, we thank them, but if you haven't habituated, then go to infowarestore.com and get a t-shirt.

[00:17:55.032 --> 00:17:56.473]  Don't California my USA.

[00:18:03.679 --> 00:18:05.681]  Big discounts on Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:18:05.741 --> 00:18:07.002]  Four-stage ion filters.
[00:18:07.042 --> 00:18:09.003]  Leading competitors.

[00:18:12.806 --> 00:18:13.266]  $50 off.
[00:18:13.286 --> 00:18:14.868]  That helps fund our operation.
[00:18:14.888 --> 00:18:16.869]  And we have the best deal on food ever.
[00:18:16.889 --> 00:18:21.613]  It's in these high-quality plastic... I mean, hell, just a plastic container at Walmart would cost us more.
[00:18:21.993 --> 00:18:30.817]  It's got a two-week food supply in a big soap container.
[00:18:31.037 --> 00:18:33.438]  1,500 calories a day, 92 servings.
[00:18:33.698 --> 00:18:38.880]  You can see that it's already got 97% positive reviews, 4.8 stars.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.561]  That is the best deal on high-quality, storable food out there.
[00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:45.762]  And it's great to have one in your garage, one in your car, one at work in case something goes down.
[00:18:45.782 --> 00:18:48.504]  Or you can give it to people for charity or give it to homeless down the road.
[00:18:48.524 --> 00:18:48.984]  It lasts 25 years.
[00:18:49.844 --> 00:18:50.905]  This is the best deal ever.
[00:18:50.985 --> 00:18:56.429]  You have a two-week supply, ladies and gentlemen, that is more than 50% off.
[00:18:56.529 --> 00:18:58.851]  It is at cost.
[00:18:59.431 --> 00:18:58.851]  $67.
[00:18:59.952 --> 00:19:01.093]  That is at cost.
[00:19:01.313 --> 00:19:04.095]  As a promotional, they're doing, because they want you to see how great it is.
[00:19:04.135 --> 00:19:04.896]  It's a loss leader.
[00:19:05.056 --> 00:19:06.437]  InfoWars Life Select.
[00:19:06.577 --> 00:19:08.058]  By that, it's a private label.
[00:19:08.078 --> 00:19:09.419]  My patrons supply what we get around.
[00:19:09.559 --> 00:19:11.681]  Contracts they have with the distributors go the lowest.
[00:19:11.841 --> 00:19:14.183]  Us being a private labeler, it's a private label.
[00:19:14.203 --> 00:19:16.024]  The very same factory, fresh, high-quality food.
[00:19:16.124 --> 00:19:16.804]  So it's all there.
[00:19:16.824 --> 00:19:16.804]  $67.

[00:19:19.485 --> 00:19:22.847]  And just the container itself, it'll cost close to that at Walmart.
[00:19:23.067 --> 00:19:24.528]  It's also highly reusable.
[00:19:24.608 --> 00:19:27.189]  Each meal is in its own vacuum-sealed packet.
[00:19:27.309 --> 00:19:27.709]  Amazing.

[00:19:32.611 --> 00:19:36.753]  But whatever you do, don't let the bullies shut you up and your free speech.

[00:19:44.896 --> 00:19:45.496]  They're all there.
[00:19:45.596 --> 00:19:46.696]  Hundreds of them.

[00:19:47.557 --> 00:19:48.357]  50% off.

[00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:35.559]  So, let me give you the good news and the bad news from my perspective.
[00:20:35.739 --> 00:20:36.899]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:20:36.939 --> 00:20:41.120]  Thanks for joining us today on this April 19th, 2019 Patriots Day.
[00:20:42.781 --> 00:20:43.121]  Friday.
[00:20:44.381 --> 00:20:45.161]  Let's get right into it.
[00:20:45.602 --> 00:20:47.222]  Here's the prime analysis.
[00:20:49.122 --> 00:20:49.943]  And the big overview.
[00:20:54.724 --> 00:20:57.945]  The Democrats, the deep state, are in bed with everybody.
[00:20:58.005 --> 00:20:59.085]  They're not Russian agents.
[00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:05.790]  They're agents to big megacorporations and the shycoms and others selling the country out to the highest bidder.
[00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.130]  They're not leaders.
[00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.131]  The Democrats and the deep staters are pimps.
[00:21:12.551 --> 00:21:17.692]  They're nothing but grocers that sell America out.
[00:21:18.192 --> 00:21:26.834]  They preside with a little pad of paper and their pen at the cash register selling your birthright out.
[00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:28.014]  My birthright.
[00:21:30.899 --> 00:21:31.239]  That's it.
[00:21:32.781 --> 00:21:33.401]  That's all they are.
[00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:53.460]  And so when you see these lowly, ugly, stupid, lying, arrogant, narcissistic, pathetic, fallen people like Nadler, and Schiff, and Pelosi, and AOC, these are the slaves!
[00:21:59.124 --> 00:22:00.045]  These are the traitors!
[00:22:00.105 --> 00:22:01.245]  This is the trash!
[00:22:04.487 --> 00:22:06.128]  That was brought up to hate America!
[00:22:06.468 --> 00:22:07.569]  By scum parents!
[00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:08.949]  They're all scum!
[00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:16.774]  And the minute you realize they have a hunger to beat you because you're better than them.
[00:22:20.536 --> 00:22:22.276]  Because you have a spirit that's different from them.
[00:22:24.238 --> 00:22:25.918]  The minute you realize that, you have victory.
[00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:28.300]  You're better than them and they know it.
[00:22:29.554 --> 00:22:30.014]  The traitors.
[00:22:30.034 --> 00:22:32.215]  They can be black, they can be white, they can be old, they can be young.
[00:22:33.716 --> 00:22:34.697]  But they have a spirit.
[00:22:37.198 --> 00:22:39.159]  And this is supposed to be their country.
[00:22:39.259 --> 00:22:40.260]  They want control.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.461]  They want to run it for global domination.
[00:22:43.462 --> 00:22:44.242]  While they destroy it.
[00:22:45.723 --> 00:22:50.306]  They want to expend the energy and the spirit of America into a great evil work.
[00:22:50.746 --> 00:22:52.647]  It's an act of satanic alchemy.
[00:22:54.565 --> 00:23:05.211]  They want to lie to you, to your face, to where you don't know up from down, like Clapper that told Congress the NSA's never spied on one American or never looked at any email or any communication ever in its history.
[00:23:05.771 --> 00:23:08.653]  That's like saying the ocean doesn't have one drop of water in it.
[00:23:09.734 --> 00:23:11.054]  That bluebirds aren't blue.
[00:23:11.755 --> 00:23:13.816]  That the American flag isn't red, white, and blue.
[00:23:16.638 --> 00:23:17.658]  It's ridiculous.
[00:23:19.079 --> 00:23:19.920]  And it's perjury.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.201]  But these criminals can do whatever they want.
[00:23:23.826 --> 00:23:24.867]  So they overreached.
[00:23:27.248 --> 00:23:28.749]  They could do whatever they want until now.
[00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.951]  They overreached and thought they were invincible.
[00:23:32.231 --> 00:23:36.634]  And this whole Russiagate was supposed to be a cover-up of their illegal activity.
[00:23:36.934 --> 00:23:38.935]  And now they came up so empty.
[00:23:40.456 --> 00:23:46.860]  If Mueller could have gotten one American, and I know they contacted thousands of people, yours truly,
[00:23:50.427 --> 00:23:54.688]  And tried to get people to take money from the Russians.
[00:23:54.708 --> 00:23:56.068]  And of course, it was never the Russians.
[00:23:56.428 --> 00:23:59.889]  It was the Democrats, the deep staters, the neocons.
[00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.310]  We never took one dollar.
[00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:03.290]  None of us.
[00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.331]  Not me, not you.
[00:24:05.371 --> 00:24:10.672]  They couldn't find anybody who was a Christian or a conservative or a Trump supporter that would take
[00:24:12.413 --> 00:24:14.014]  20, 30 pieces of silver.
[00:24:14.815 --> 00:24:16.456]  They couldn't find a Benedict Arnold.
[00:24:16.696 --> 00:24:18.537]  They couldn't find a Judas Iscariot.
[00:24:18.977 --> 00:24:24.981]  They couldn't find it even with super hot blonde Russian sex operatives that work for the CIA.
[00:24:27.383 --> 00:24:32.126]  They couldn't find ONE patriot to sell out their country!
[00:24:32.306 --> 00:24:33.947]  Of course you couldn't, enemy!
[00:24:34.647 --> 00:24:37.309]  Because we're the opposite of you and always will be.
[00:24:39.871 --> 00:24:41.512]  We're not for sale, scum!
[00:24:44.741 --> 00:24:48.343]  We already sold out to Christ.
[00:24:50.264 --> 00:24:51.145]  He'll never get us.
[00:24:53.286 --> 00:24:56.868]  And that's what you have to understand is, this is their giant failure.
[00:24:57.909 --> 00:25:03.993]  And the report itself is a cover-up and a facade that, oh, Russia was still involved.
[00:25:04.573 --> 00:25:05.293]  As Trump says, BS.
[00:25:08.237 --> 00:25:11.920]  And it's a cover-up for Rosenstein and McCabe and all the other traitors.
[00:25:13.041 --> 00:25:14.723]  We can't be traitors if we're always against the country.
[00:25:15.003 --> 00:25:16.104]  Just globalist operatives.
[00:25:16.584 --> 00:25:17.305]  Foreign soldiers.
[00:25:17.645 --> 00:25:18.666]  Embedded enemy agents.
[00:25:20.688 --> 00:25:21.689]  Really, they're not guilty of treason.
[00:25:21.709 --> 00:25:24.111]  These people have all been anti-American their whole lives.
[00:25:26.113 --> 00:25:31.057]  The oaths they gave meant nothing because they gave oaths spiritually when they signed their soul over their God.
[00:25:32.679 --> 00:25:35.221]  But let me just digress, or get out of the digression and get into it.
[00:25:38.342 --> 00:25:39.783]  The bad news is this, though.
[00:25:40.343 --> 00:26:01.098]  The main objective of us not having peace with Russia and making it where Trump can't ever do anything reasonable with Russia, when that's the perfect geopolitical answer for worldwide defense of the West, worldwide defense of Christianity, worldwide defense of the family, the path of throwing the globalist oligarchs out.
[00:26:01.238 --> 00:26:06.302]  Russia ran the first successful blueprint of this because they hit bottom first.
[00:26:06.782 --> 00:26:07.823]  They came up for air first.
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:15.685]  And Russia's not perfect, it has its own problems, but the only Russian collusion is in the spirit.
[00:26:17.026 --> 00:26:20.348]  In that nations all over the world are pulling out of the unelected, tyrannical world government.
[00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:24.251]  And Russia is almost four times geographically the size of the U.S.
[00:26:25.292 --> 00:26:28.555]  It has a culture in many ways very similar to ours and the West.
[00:26:29.255 --> 00:26:35.760]  And geographically, if you study geopolitics and the Grand Chessboard model, that is the model carried out by the CIA,
[00:26:37.788 --> 00:26:38.830]  As if it is the model.
[00:26:39.692 --> 00:26:40.974]  So it's a template they're using.
[00:26:41.596 --> 00:26:44.341]  A link up with the United States and Russia.
[00:26:44.802 --> 00:26:46.766]  Geographically for ports of entry.
[00:26:47.146 --> 00:26:49.371]  Military control is global domination.
[00:26:50.541 --> 00:27:12.841]  It's the alliance that would defeat radical Islam, stabilize the planet, stop the India-Pakistan time bomb nuclear war, that's the number one threat most analysts believe, checkmate communist China, make them sue for peace and normalize and move out of that authoritarian system that the globalists set up, shut down the EU, break it up, have it enter into a new federation,
[00:27:14.022 --> 00:27:14.943]  Of the free nations.
[00:27:15.663 --> 00:27:18.105]  The Free Nation Federation.
[00:27:18.405 --> 00:27:19.186]  1776 worldwide.
[00:27:19.246 --> 00:27:20.427]  Whatever you want to call it.
[00:27:21.248 --> 00:27:29.434]  A real global system where the nation states are in charge, but people do meet and discuss to create consensus.
[00:27:30.795 --> 00:27:35.499]  Because anything the enemy creates is a counterfeit of what we were already building towards.
[00:27:36.539 --> 00:27:37.100]  You understand that?
[00:27:39.942 --> 00:27:40.542]  World peace.
[00:27:41.823 --> 00:27:43.884]  To the best level we can get it, not a utopia.
[00:27:45.645 --> 00:27:51.309]  Even the Carnegie Endowment said 80 years ago is working with Russia.
[00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:56.492]  The problem is they had control of Russia with a communist program and wanted to merge that with us.
[00:27:57.053 --> 00:28:04.337]  But this reform in Russia is as real as it could be with Christianity and the family and opposing Hollywood.
[00:28:04.657 --> 00:28:08.160]  You turn on Russian television, not the stuff that RT puts out, a bunch of liberal crap,
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.822]  But RT America is like CNN.
[00:28:11.243 --> 00:28:13.886]  But the stuff that is in Russia, you turn it on, it's like Infowars.
[00:28:14.206 --> 00:28:17.831]  The governments in Europe have a plan to break up your families and replace you with Muslims.
[00:28:18.271 --> 00:28:19.052]  We're not doing that.
[00:28:19.192 --> 00:28:23.157]  Get tax exemption and paid, you know, how many hundred thousand rubles to have a child.
[00:28:23.437 --> 00:28:24.538]  Don't let Russia die.
[00:28:24.819 --> 00:28:27.422]  Don't go with the globalist program of anti-human.
[00:28:28.567 --> 00:28:32.510]  Because Russia's decided to not kill itself and commit suicide.
[00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.053]  So the bad news is, yeah, the whole thing was a distraction.
[00:28:36.093 --> 00:28:37.274]  We wasted two years on it.
[00:28:37.674 --> 00:28:40.216]  It blocked a lot of, you know, Trump's agenda.
[00:28:40.736 --> 00:28:41.917]  And we call it a victory now?
[00:28:42.678 --> 00:28:44.559]  The victory is sending all these crooks to prison.
[00:28:45.019 --> 00:28:55.067]  They've already had the victory in creating a new Cold War with Russia, leading towards war, with Trump being way more brutal to Russia than anybody since before Ronald Reagan.
[00:28:55.627 --> 00:28:56.487]  It's very dangerous.
[00:28:56.767 --> 00:29:02.849]  Because one of Trump's main failings is showing he's on a Russian Minion, kicking Russia upside the head for no reason.
[00:29:04.849 --> 00:29:14.271]  I want to put forward an allegory, or a story to explain where I'm coming from that parallels current real-time reality.
[00:29:14.731 --> 00:29:17.232]  So please, bear with me a few minutes.
[00:29:18.712 --> 00:29:21.673]  Because this is just bubbling up in my own thought processes.
[00:29:22.947 --> 00:29:24.468]  Of why am I sitting here with my shirt off?
[00:29:25.329 --> 00:29:27.350]  I want to be crystal clear with everybody.
[00:29:29.111 --> 00:29:40.198]  What I'm about to say is not about putting down California like we're different football teams and we're talking about the University of Texas versus UCLA.
[00:29:41.459 --> 00:29:45.782]  This is not... Alex Jones is a tribalist going, woo!
[00:29:46.242 --> 00:29:48.003]  Texas is way better than California.
[00:29:48.243 --> 00:29:48.964]  F California.
[00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:54.833]  California until about 30 years ago was undoubtedly the best state in the Union.
[00:29:56.014 --> 00:30:00.498]  It was more Texan than Texans because it was the last big frontier state.
[00:30:01.118 --> 00:30:05.922]  The 49ers, all of it, I mean the history books I've read about it have been incredible.
[00:30:07.323 --> 00:30:11.566]  It was deep red until just about 25 years ago.
[00:30:13.388 --> 00:30:19.873]  The Democrats came in, they opened the borders, they engineered the state, they created socialism, dependency, and now the state is
[00:30:21.499 --> 00:30:23.200]  A skeleton of its former self.
[00:30:24.481 --> 00:30:27.983]  And now Beto and others have set their sights to turn Texas blue.
[00:30:28.503 --> 00:30:35.947]  And most political experts agree by 2024, Texas will be deep blue.
[00:30:36.887 --> 00:30:38.488]  My fellow Texans are in a coma.
[00:30:38.948 --> 00:30:46.112]  But as Kennedy said, and as Eisenhower said, and as Nixon said, and as Reagan said, as goes Texas, so goes the nation.
[00:30:46.352 --> 00:30:49.094]  It's been like that since the Civil War.
[00:30:50.592 --> 00:30:51.453]  That's a whole other history book.
[00:30:52.493 --> 00:31:00.759]  And so the fall of California, and it's a big, gaping hole in our defenses for the collapse of Latin America, it's not a positive thing.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.781]  It's not something I celebrate.
[00:31:03.801 --> 00:31:05.302]  It's like whistling past the graveyard.
[00:31:05.382 --> 00:31:16.509]  But the carpetbaggers from all over the country that went to California, because it was the best state 30 years ago, who aren't Californians, they ruined that incredible state.
[00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.351]  They destroyed that incredible state.
[00:31:20.851 --> 00:31:29.596]  And now like locusts, or piranhas, or Nazi U-boat wolf packs, they have come to Texas to ruin our state.
[00:31:30.036 --> 00:31:47.467]  We have 10 different amazing t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com, like this Don't California by USA flag t-shirt at InfoWarsTore.com that are great attention grabbers and conversation starters no matter where you live.
[00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:57.232]  In the country, because if the Democrats can take down Texas and Florida, it's over, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:58.493 --> 00:32:03.054]  The globalists want InfoWars shut down because they can track back.
[00:32:03.134 --> 00:32:05.055]  Almost all their defeats are to what we do.
[00:32:05.755 --> 00:32:08.616]  I instinctively know how to defeat them, just like you do.
[00:32:08.896 --> 00:32:09.856]  Probably resonate together.
[00:32:10.196 --> 00:32:16.518]  And I'm telling you, this Don't California My USA, this Don't California My Texas is the answer.
[00:32:16.758 --> 00:32:17.998]  But people have to be warned.
[00:32:18.558 --> 00:32:22.919]  We have 10 different limited edition shirts at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:23.419 --> 00:32:25.700]  Right now for men and women in all the sizes.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.221]  And I want this to be a major movement.
[00:32:29.181 --> 00:32:33.403]  And so, for the next week or so, while supplies last, 50% off.
[00:32:34.043 --> 00:32:38.025]  That means I'm making 5 bucks on these shirts in front of the Infowar.
[00:32:38.045 --> 00:32:44.288]  So spread the word, meet like-minded people, cause a debate, become a billboard for liberty and freedom today.
[00:32:44.308 --> 00:32:50.231]  InfowarStore.com and look at the 10 limited edition
[00:32:51.331 --> 00:32:52.852]  Don't California my USA.
[00:32:52.872 --> 00:32:53.932]  Don't California Texas.
[00:32:54.472 --> 00:32:56.353]  I welcome folks to say don't California Florida.
[00:32:56.573 --> 00:32:59.074]  Let's just get this going nationwide and let's win again.
[00:32:59.375 --> 00:33:00.775]  We can do it if we take action.
[00:33:00.955 --> 00:33:02.196]  We can save America.
[00:33:07.038 --> 00:33:09.699]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.281]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:28.581 --> 00:33:30.441]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.363 --> 00:33:37.984]  So, I'm gonna open up the phone in the second and third hour.
[00:33:38.104 --> 00:33:39.124]  I had some guests on today.
[00:33:39.144 --> 00:33:40.044]  I've cleared the decks.
[00:33:41.544 --> 00:33:44.025]  Specifically on the Mueller Report, what you think's coming next.
[00:33:46.726 --> 00:33:50.767]  The big win is Trump wanted to thaw relations with the Russians.
[00:33:53.248 --> 00:33:54.208]  Russia has way more
[00:33:55.390 --> 00:34:07.157]  ...resources than the second most resource-laden continent, which is named Africa, that the CHICOMs are swallowing up right now.
[00:34:07.998 --> 00:34:12.741]  The United States has been specifically geopolitically cut off by the globalists, sold out.
[00:34:13.961 --> 00:34:16.303]  And Trump is just saying, we're not going to do one-sided deals anymore.
[00:34:16.583 --> 00:34:21.486]  And he's barely turned the ship around, and we're already seeing a lot of big dividends.
[00:34:23.114 --> 00:34:26.135]  We've already seen the private Federal Reserve try to spike that recovery.
[00:34:26.476 --> 00:34:30.417]  You can see the whole power structure working against President Trump.
[00:34:32.118 --> 00:34:41.562]  But you've got people in the general public and people in government who don't want to destroy the country and who understand that what they've been waiting for is here, so they're behind Trump.
[00:34:43.663 --> 00:34:46.705]  So in the final equation, we'll get your view on this coming up next hour.
[00:34:46.725 --> 00:34:48.626]  I'll get the number out in about 20 minutes.
[00:34:50.366 --> 00:34:51.247]  In the final equation,
[00:34:53.567 --> 00:34:55.108]  Mueller didn't have any choice.
[00:34:56.809 --> 00:34:59.371]  You see, Mueller was a deep state fix-it man.
[00:35:01.592 --> 00:35:07.717]  Mueller was somebody, back from the days in Vietnam, who knew how to keep his mouth shut about operations.
[00:35:09.037 --> 00:35:18.564]  And so Mueller was a establishment clean-up man, back to the days of Whitey Bulger.
[00:35:19.865 --> 00:35:21.546]  You see, Robert Mueller is a follower.
[00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:24.841]  And so what does it tell you?
[00:35:28.182 --> 00:35:29.943]  Well, it tells you he knows Trump's winning.
[00:35:31.623 --> 00:35:32.684]  And you know why Trump's winning?
[00:35:33.724 --> 00:35:35.084]  Because Trump's not out of the swamp.
[00:35:37.305 --> 00:35:40.466]  And everything Trump's ever done has been completely legal.
[00:35:41.306 --> 00:35:44.667]  He's neurotic about nobody's gonna set him
[00:35:50.487 --> 00:35:51.628]  I'm the same way.
[00:35:51.648 --> 00:35:54.330]  I overpay their fake taxes.
[00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.451]  I don't even speed anymore.
[00:35:56.471 --> 00:35:59.794]  I was driving to work in a 70 at 65 like an old lady today.
[00:36:01.495 --> 00:36:05.478]  I notice the older I get, it's not that I'm more careful.
[00:36:05.598 --> 00:36:09.701]  It's just that, well, as you get older, you are more careful.
[00:36:10.742 --> 00:36:13.444]  But the point is, I don't have any instinct to break the law.
[00:36:13.924 --> 00:36:15.385]  I don't get off on breaking the law.
[00:36:16.786 --> 00:36:18.448]  If a law is wrong, I try to change it.
[00:36:19.683 --> 00:36:24.964]  And so Trump is the last person on earth that goes to a hotel and has Russians piss on him.
[00:36:25.304 --> 00:36:26.364]  That's ridiculous!
[00:36:26.744 --> 00:36:29.205]  You've seen his discipline, his commitment.
[00:36:30.145 --> 00:36:31.245]  The guy's a clean freak.
[00:36:33.725 --> 00:36:34.346]  It's all crap.
[00:36:35.246 --> 00:36:36.606]  It's not about defensive Trump.
[00:36:39.106 --> 00:36:40.427]  This is about defensive truth.
[00:36:43.047 --> 00:36:47.708]  And so I'm going to say this now, and I'm going to shoot a special video that's a message to the President because he's getting through to him.
[00:36:48.755 --> 00:36:50.636]  Through certain people at the White House.
[00:36:52.117 --> 00:36:57.700]  And General Kelly telling him that he's not to read InfoWars or to watch my videos actually made Trump watch more.
[00:36:58.801 --> 00:37:07.366]  Can't the New York Times and Washington Post, when they had like 500 articles in the news a year and a half ago saying InfoWars banned in the White House, Trump not allowed to read it?
[00:37:07.466 --> 00:37:13.050]  I mean, what do you think he does when he sees hundreds and hundreds of articles, literally,
[00:37:13.933 --> 00:37:16.074]  Because they'd put it in AP and then it'd be in every newspaper in the country.
[00:37:16.315 --> 00:37:26.161]  But sometimes 50 articles a day, for weeks on end, saying, he shouldn't have press passes, get rid of them, bad info wars, don't let Trump read it, Trump's too weak-minded to listen to Jones.
[00:37:26.481 --> 00:37:27.582]  Too weak-minded.
[00:37:28.762 --> 00:37:32.905]  When Trump watches this show, this is what the real Trump's like behind the scenes.
[00:37:33.726 --> 00:37:35.767]  More aggressive than I am, more pissed off.
[00:37:36.954 --> 00:37:37.955]  More pro-America.
[00:37:38.375 --> 00:37:39.135]  Fire-breathing.
[00:37:39.576 --> 00:37:44.258]  Trump just finds his apprentice that he never had when he tunes in.
[00:37:45.579 --> 00:37:46.680]  And the enemy knows that.
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:51.863]  But they try to create this whole projection that I'm telling Trump what to do.
[00:37:52.323 --> 00:37:52.463]  No.
[00:37:54.725 --> 00:37:57.766]  Trump tunes in and hears exactly what he's already thinking.
[00:37:59.848 --> 00:38:01.248]  And so they watched over and over again.
[00:38:01.288 --> 00:38:02.089]  Him go, that's right.
[00:38:04.963 --> 00:38:05.343]  That's it.
[00:38:06.503 --> 00:38:07.064]  That's correct.
[00:38:07.984 --> 00:38:08.764]  That's the truth.
[00:38:10.225 --> 00:38:11.605]  Trump needs that sounding board.
[00:38:11.625 --> 00:38:13.085]  That's why you need to go to his rallies.
[00:38:13.105 --> 00:38:14.246]  You need to call into the shows.
[00:38:14.566 --> 00:38:15.466]  You need to call the White House.
[00:38:15.506 --> 00:38:19.808]  You need to talk to him because he needs that interface.
[00:38:21.548 --> 00:38:25.329]  You know, Ann Coulter can get a lot of cheap points, and I've invited her on the show.
[00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:26.009]  Hopefully she'll come back.
[00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:30.691]  Saying, oh my god, Trump's a traitor!
[00:38:31.792 --> 00:38:39.939]  He's offered the Democrats partial amnesty for those that are here if they'll just give us $12 billion to build a wall and build more detention centers.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:45.924]  He knows they're not going to do that and are going to demand totally open borders, and he shows what frauds they are.
[00:38:48.926 --> 00:38:53.249]  And now you see them admitting it's a total crisis, worse than it's ever been, collapse at the border.
[00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:54.751]  It's a crisis!
[00:38:56.499 --> 00:39:05.761]  And the people telling us that he's a Russian agent and hates America are the ones that publicly say America was never great, it'll never be great.
[00:39:08.482 --> 00:39:13.443]  AOC, all of them, Ilhan Omar can't quit running their mouths.
[00:39:14.223 --> 00:39:24.706]  And you take some low IQ dumbass, like those women, that come from tyranny, and you put them in power and hope they're going to appreciate it, they want to piss all over it because of existential envy.
[00:39:26.667 --> 00:39:27.708]  They don't like it!
[00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:32.410]  They can't handle it!
[00:39:38.254 --> 00:39:42.256]  Those women in Somalia would be sold as sex slaves in five minutes.
[00:39:42.656 --> 00:39:46.098]  And if they talked back to their Muslim owners, they'd knock their teeth out.
[00:39:49.957 --> 00:40:02.240]  But they can come here where everybody kisses their ass and just piss all over Christianity, piss all over the West, bitch and complain, tell us how much it sucks, then get your ass out of my country, you piece of trash!
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.420]  You filth!
[00:40:05.301 --> 00:40:06.061]  You garbage!
[00:40:06.641 --> 00:40:12.362]  There's plenty of people from around the world of every race, color, and creed that appreciate freedom and don't want to piss all over it!
[00:40:13.063 --> 00:40:14.603]  So get the hell out, scum!
[00:40:15.483 --> 00:40:16.943]  You're a curse on this nation!
[00:40:17.944 --> 00:40:18.884]  I'm sorry, let me get to the news here.
[00:40:23.723 --> 00:40:38.475]  The fact that we have the Deep State on Chaicom Tit and the CFR Crime Syndicate trying to kill this country.
[00:40:39.676 --> 00:40:54.246]  And the fact that they ran this whole hoax to take over the election process and overturn the election, and have a real authoritarian coup over the election system, and they set up CIA networks publicly with billions of dollars to harass and jack with everyone that's pro-American?
[00:40:57.548 --> 00:40:59.349]  I demand justice, President Trump!
[00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:01.791]  I demand retribution!
[00:41:02.951 --> 00:41:04.833]  I demand that they pay!
[00:41:06.644 --> 00:41:14.286]  Not because I'm a vengeful person, but because you let these monsters stalk around the countryside feeding on our innocent people.
[00:41:15.526 --> 00:41:21.767]  The Democrats can't lick the blood off their lips fast enough as they pass laws saying they're going to kill babies after they're born.
[00:41:22.047 --> 00:41:23.868]  North Carolina just did it.
[00:41:27.108 --> 00:41:29.549]  This isn't politics or trying to win the next election.
[00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:30.789]  This is cutting a cancer out.
[00:41:32.335 --> 00:41:37.619]  We don't sit here and let these groups and organizations run around engaging in their sabotage.
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.442]  Or we're aiding and abetting it and it's a dereliction of duty.
[00:41:41.662 --> 00:41:49.647]  So I don't ask, I demand that the courts and the President and the Congress remove the Democrat scourge.
[00:41:49.848 --> 00:41:51.449]  They are not a party in this nation.
[00:41:51.709 --> 00:42:00.956]  They are an outside group of traitors with a giant brainwashed mass of mentally ill criminals that work for them trying to bully this nation into hell.
[00:42:01.636 --> 00:42:03.477]  This is our new World War II!
[00:42:03.718 --> 00:42:05.239]  This is our existential moment!
[00:42:05.539 --> 00:42:09.742]  This is the globalist parasites running our country, just like they did Russia!
[00:42:09.962 --> 00:42:12.764]  And I DEMAND the oligarchs be removed!
[00:42:13.284 --> 00:42:17.126]  I DEMAND the Federal Reserve be broken up, and the President put his people in!
[00:42:17.747 --> 00:42:28.974]  I DEMAND all of these traitors that have committed incredible crimes, and gotten hundreds of millions of dollars apiece in some cases, like Michael Moore of taxpayer money, to finance their poison!
[00:42:29.615 --> 00:42:29.635]  I
[00:42:29.855 --> 00:42:31.717]  I want them audited!
[00:42:31.737 --> 00:42:33.698]  I want them indicted!
[00:42:34.139 --> 00:42:36.300]  I want them in prison now!
[00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:38.762]  Or roll over and die!
[00:42:39.543 --> 00:42:44.287]  These very same enemies are trying to crush our borders right now and sack our nation!
[00:42:44.928 --> 00:42:49.952]  And if we don't rally to save the republic, then stick a fork in it and begin the evacuation.
[00:42:50.212 --> 00:42:50.792]  But to where?
[00:42:51.813 --> 00:42:54.035]  Remember the globalists have their people everywhere.
[00:42:54.055 --> 00:42:55.476]  No, we stand and we fight here.
[00:42:56.548 --> 00:43:00.489]  On this hill, on this republic our forebears built.
[00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:07.451]  You're sitting there, you gather up the flame and say, I got a good idea.
[00:43:08.451 --> 00:43:14.132]  Let's gather up everything we have, sell it, give it to some coyotes and take us to a country that doesn't want us.
[00:43:14.913 --> 00:43:16.733]  Drop us off in God knows where.
[00:43:17.893 --> 00:43:21.854]  We don't know anybody, we're going to leave everything that's familiar to us, let's go.
[00:43:21.874 --> 00:43:23.735]  Isn't that going to be a great idea?
[00:43:26.664 --> 00:43:29.911]  These are horrible decisions these people are making.
[00:43:29.951 --> 00:43:31.133]  To decide to come here.
[00:43:33.403 --> 00:43:44.453]  I don't know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guest workers who will work for lower wages than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are right now.
[00:43:45.034 --> 00:43:48.277]  Illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple.
[00:43:49.298 --> 00:43:56.605]  Until the American people are convinced that we will stop future flows of illegal immigration, we will make no progress.
[00:43:57.714 --> 00:44:12.139]  Well, look, I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in.
[00:44:12.479 --> 00:44:15.040]  And I do think you have to control your borders.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:18.621]  The bill before us will certainly do some good.
[00:44:19.787 --> 00:44:25.530]  It will authorize some badly needed funding for better fences and better security along our borders.
[00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:31.152]  And that should help stem some of the tide of illegal immigration in this country.
[00:44:33.618 --> 00:44:42.603]  Not only in the states most heavily affected, but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country.
[00:44:42.923 --> 00:44:48.686]  The day when America could be the welfare system for Mexico is gone.
[00:44:49.066 --> 00:44:50.647]  We simply can't afford it.
[00:44:51.027 --> 00:44:54.789]  The people who should be here are those who come legally at this time.
[00:44:55.009 --> 00:44:58.651]  And we've got to, for the time being, enforce our borders.
[00:45:05.919 --> 00:45:06.639]  There is a mission.
[00:45:07.019 --> 00:45:08.900]  I'm asking you to accept it and take action.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.982]  We've had such a huge effect over the years with our t-shirts.
[00:45:12.302 --> 00:45:14.403]  We haven't had a hit t-shirt over a year.
[00:45:14.523 --> 00:45:21.486]  Yeah, we sell a few hundred here, a few thousand there, but when we had 50,000 Hillary for Prisoners shirts on the street, or an Obama joker, 100,000 on the street.
[00:45:22.466 --> 00:45:25.049]  It changed the world, and it funded the InfoWar.
[00:45:25.329 --> 00:45:27.351]  All of our apparel is 50% off.
[00:45:27.912 --> 00:45:31.296]  That's all the t-shirts, all the ball caps, all everything.
[00:45:31.456 --> 00:45:39.885]  So, again, I would encourage listeners to understand, if you're on a right-wing or nationalist area, you'll get pats on the back, a cup of coffee probably bought for you wearing an InfoWar shirt, meet a lot of like-minded people.
[00:45:39.905 --> 00:45:40.666]  It's a real adventure.
[00:45:40.746 --> 00:45:42.548]  But if you're in a leftist area, they don't speak Latin.
[00:45:42.628 --> 00:45:42.788]  I don't
[00:46:03.353 --> 00:46:05.255]  But you know, our audience really doesn't run.
[00:46:05.395 --> 00:46:14.103]  So I made all these t-shirts that don't have InfoWars on them, and people like them, but nothing like they do the ones that are loud and proud, InfoWars.com, or that Trump Medusa t-shirt's my favorite.
[00:46:14.163 --> 00:46:19.628]  But the best-selling is the in-your-face, big, bright red InfoWars.com shirt.
[00:46:19.728 --> 00:46:20.989]  That's the one everybody wants.
[00:46:21.249 --> 00:46:31.198]  Right there, we have the Don't Tread On Me, we have Mean Like A Wolverine, we have a bunch of great ball caps, 1776, 50% off all apparel, and they point out it's annual.
[00:46:31.318 --> 00:46:33.880]  We've not done this, I looked it up, in over a year.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:37.783]  Listen, the dollar isn't what it used to be, but everything is 50% off.
[00:46:37.803 --> 00:46:41.427]  We go and look at what the purchase order is, what it was, they give you literally 50% off.
[00:46:41.787 --> 00:46:46.931]  This is the best time, and these shirts freak the leftists out, the globalists out, and it helps fund this great operation.
[00:46:47.111 --> 00:46:47.932]  All apparel, 50% off.
[00:46:48.973 --> 00:46:50.694]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.876 --> 00:47:31.564]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:34.908 --> 00:47:44.540]  I'm just gonna tell the globalists something right now.
[00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:48.011]  Get some, get some, get some.
[00:47:48.752 --> 00:47:51.354]  You're tearing your ass up one side and down the other.
[00:47:52.555 --> 00:48:04.964]  Before I'm done, before this audience of activists are done, your old David Rockefeller New World Order is going snake eyes straight up, belly up in the sun, deader than a doornail.
[00:48:05.704 --> 00:48:08.867]  There ain't no putting your stinking system back together again.
[00:48:10.107 --> 00:48:11.929]  You won't stop human development.
[00:48:12.867 --> 00:48:14.307]  You won't stop human destiny.
[00:48:15.348 --> 00:48:16.368]  You're only here to test us.
[00:48:16.928 --> 00:48:18.689]  And the faithful will prevail.
[00:48:18.709 --> 00:48:25.511]  I'm going to give the number out because we're going to have open phones the next hour and play a bunch of clips, get to a bunch of news and stuff as it breaks here.
[00:48:25.531 --> 00:48:26.631]  I've got so much to get to.
[00:48:26.831 --> 00:48:27.892]  So much I haven't even mentioned.
[00:48:27.912 --> 00:48:28.492]  It's insane.
[00:48:29.792 --> 00:48:31.933]  But the globalists failed.
[00:48:34.333 --> 00:48:37.915]  Because they have a bunch of followers and a bunch of cowards and a bunch of scum.
[00:48:39.455 --> 00:48:42.376]  And because everything they built was built on a house of sand.
[00:48:43.507 --> 00:48:46.468]  With the high tide of liberty coming in to a boot.
[00:48:49.329 --> 00:48:55.271]  And the water and the waves and the wind blew away their little castles.
[00:48:59.292 --> 00:49:02.973]  Made of sand that fall into the sea eventually, to quote Jimi Hendrix.
[00:49:04.514 --> 00:49:06.054]  Oh, but that's the bad news.
[00:49:06.795 --> 00:49:07.575]  They're not stopping.
[00:49:09.278 --> 00:49:14.401]  They're swearing in the committees run by Maxine Waters to kill the economy.
[00:49:15.842 --> 00:49:18.023]  And to harass and threaten companies to not move here.
[00:49:18.063 --> 00:49:19.004]  She's actually said that.
[00:49:20.064 --> 00:49:21.365]  And she's actually run a lot of them off.
[00:49:21.805 --> 00:49:23.066]  What a horrible person!
[00:49:23.086 --> 00:49:32.512]  I mean, we have people working against us, trying to collapse the borders, trying to break up our families, saying our pro-America president is a Russian agent, trying to shut down the free press.
[00:49:33.922 --> 00:49:35.983]  They've passed bills in what, a couple states?
[00:49:36.403 --> 00:49:40.124]  They're signing bills in others to kill babies after they're born.
[00:49:40.144 --> 00:49:41.485]  That's in the news today.
[00:49:41.505 --> 00:49:48.247]  North Carolina had a bill to say, if a baby's born, and it doesn't die in the abortion, you'll keep it alive.
[00:49:48.468 --> 00:49:50.468]  And the governor said, no, we're gonna kill it.
[00:49:50.648 --> 00:49:52.089]  That's killing after they're born.
[00:49:52.349 --> 00:49:54.050]  See, they're always moving the goalposts, man.
[00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:55.690]  Case for killing granny.
[00:49:56.711 --> 00:49:57.431]  Kill that baby.
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:04.407]  See, they've been teaching for 30 years in colleges that you should kill children up to three if the state decides their future isn't good.
[00:50:06.041 --> 00:50:08.003]  Even if a child's, quote, depressed, let's just kill them.
[00:50:08.543 --> 00:50:15.668]  See, so they kill them mentally with the autism, and then they tell the parents, you know, it's too expensive, because right now it's 1 in 58's got autism.
[00:50:15.929 --> 00:50:16.789]  It'll soon be 1 in 3.
[00:50:16.829 --> 00:50:20.772]  It was 1 in 35,000 just 30-something years ago.
[00:50:21.213 --> 00:50:23.755]  And it'll be like, well, you know, make the decision.
[00:50:24.075 --> 00:50:25.036]  We're killing your son.
[00:50:25.676 --> 00:50:26.857]  Because it's boys, right?
[00:50:26.917 --> 00:50:27.938]  You know, they're targeting.
[00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:29.899]  A little special thing in the vaccine.
[00:50:29.919 --> 00:50:31.621]  A little thing they're going to give you.
[00:50:32.601 --> 00:50:33.902]  A little treaty-weedy.
[00:50:34.482 --> 00:50:37.123]  Nothing like a treaty-weedy for your boy!
[00:50:37.143 --> 00:50:42.066]  So we're gonna cover all that, too.
[00:50:42.126 --> 00:50:46.648]  Let me just say to the globalists du hast, I hate you.
[00:50:47.028 --> 00:50:51.670]  But, I don't do it for my hate of you, I do it for my love of all you out there.
[00:50:52.971 --> 00:50:57.013]  Humble, good, well-meaning, strong people that I salute.
[00:51:03.157 --> 00:51:06.659]  I would never have been this close to God without all this adversity.
[00:51:10.802 --> 00:51:13.404]  And only now do I realize how real the Bible is.
[00:51:13.464 --> 00:51:14.265]  It's so true.
[00:51:14.285 --> 00:51:20.829]  You know, the world hates Christ.
[00:51:23.091 --> 00:51:27.454]  And the world's gonna hate those of you that have Christ in you, like our unborn children.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.562]  The system hates women more than anything because they're so powerful and magical.
[00:51:33.863 --> 00:51:34.723]  They want to own them.
[00:51:35.043 --> 00:51:35.804]  They want to run them.
[00:51:35.844 --> 00:51:37.305]  And they're their friend.
[00:51:37.345 --> 00:51:38.766]  They'll take care of you.
[00:51:41.728 --> 00:51:47.812]  But then Candace Owens found out it was the left posing as white supremacist, threatening her to get control of her social network.
[00:51:48.813 --> 00:51:52.135]  And then she went from a leftist overnight to a free mind.
[00:51:53.396 --> 00:51:54.197]  And that's all I want.
[00:51:56.081 --> 00:51:57.962]  All I want is for people to be free.
[00:51:59.182 --> 00:52:00.062]  Because I have children.
[00:52:01.823 --> 00:52:04.984]  And I want them to grow up in a future with your children that are free.
[00:52:07.485 --> 00:52:09.585]  And I want their great-great-grandchildren to be free.
[00:52:11.526 --> 00:52:14.347]  And to be able to make the decisions about the destiny they want.
[00:52:16.228 --> 00:52:20.329]  But the clear and present danger is the Democratic Party.
[00:52:22.438 --> 00:52:26.139]  Who are not the Democratic Party of Thomas Jefferson, they are the Globalist Party.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.780]  And you know, that's the thing about the Democrats.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:36.622]  Did you know it was the Democrats who worked with British intelligence to start the Civil War?
[00:52:37.802 --> 00:52:39.963]  And who wanted to break the country up and have their own nation?
[00:52:40.583 --> 00:52:45.024]  And again, I had ancestors that were colonels and generals in the Confederacy.
[00:52:47.819 --> 00:52:48.219]  You name it.
[00:52:48.399 --> 00:52:50.260]  This is not a debate about North versus South.
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:51.900]  Both sides had grievances.
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:52.900]  It wasn't about slavery.
[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:53.720]  I know all that.
[00:52:54.180 --> 00:53:00.382]  But the South got suckered into it by British intelligence 30 years before Andrew Jackson as president, who was a Southerner, stopped it.
[00:53:01.822 --> 00:53:05.203]  The founder of Texas was thrown out of office as governor.
[00:53:05.683 --> 00:53:07.043]  He'd been president, then governor.
[00:53:09.104 --> 00:53:09.604]  San Houston.
[00:53:12.503 --> 00:53:13.243]  They almost killed him.
[00:53:13.544 --> 00:53:17.306]  Threw him out of Houston because he said, you're being shut up by powerful global forces.
[00:53:17.746 --> 00:53:21.228]  The North's got ten times the industry and five times the men.
[00:53:21.588 --> 00:53:23.389]  We'll beat them for the first year.
[00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:27.411]  You'll kill our best men and then they're going to sack and burn everything.
[00:53:27.431 --> 00:53:30.513]  And they said, you get out of here, you son of a bitch.
[00:53:30.853 --> 00:53:31.713]  We know best.
[00:53:31.813 --> 00:53:32.734]  We're going to war.
[00:53:33.919 --> 00:53:34.780]  You saw what happened.
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:36.922]  I read a whole book with his letters in it.
[00:53:36.982 --> 00:53:37.542]  I forget the name of it.
[00:53:37.782 --> 00:53:39.824]  Like 20 years ago, it made me cry.
[00:53:40.345 --> 00:53:42.466]  Sam Houston was a mountain of a man.
[00:53:42.486 --> 00:53:44.788]  He was what Davy Crockett wishes he was.
[00:53:45.249 --> 00:53:46.370]  He was the real Davy Crockett.
[00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:53.436]  He had like 10 arrows sticking out of him, like kill like 20, you know, Indians to use that term at the time, with a hatchet.
[00:53:53.456 --> 00:53:54.417]  The Indians worshipped him.
[00:53:54.437 --> 00:53:55.437]  He was like a killing machine.
[00:53:56.278 --> 00:54:00.702]  And there he was, as an old man, telling Texas, don't do this, don't join it, you're crazy.
[00:54:01.302 --> 00:54:04.185]  It's a British intelligence setup, my God, don't do it.
[00:54:04.565 --> 00:54:06.127]  Listen to what Andrew Jackson said.
[00:54:07.248 --> 00:54:19.018]  He sent him, Andrew Jackson sent him to found Texas with my ancestors, who were the treasurers of Texas, so they could be trusted.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:25.143]  And it just blows my mind to watch these betrayals over and over again.
[00:54:26.563 --> 00:54:28.925]  And to watch us suckered into this over and over again.
[00:54:30.505 --> 00:54:33.267]  And they're trying to cause a civil war again, these bastards.
[00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:37.309]  It just never ends.
[00:54:37.329 --> 00:54:47.635]  And that doesn't mean the Republicans are perfect, but we formed an insurrection into the globalist operation.
[00:54:49.281 --> 00:54:50.062]  To the Republicans.
[00:54:51.683 --> 00:54:54.485]  And we have been kicking their ass and they don't know what to do.
[00:54:56.787 --> 00:54:58.868]  But the bad news is the Democrats are digging in.
[00:54:58.908 --> 00:54:59.749]  They're not going to stop.
[00:55:00.009 --> 00:55:00.770]  They're going to obstruct.
[00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:02.311]  They're going to sabotage.
[00:55:02.531 --> 00:55:03.792]  They're going to commit more crimes.
[00:55:03.812 --> 00:55:06.834]  They're going to do more Jussie Smollett staged events.
[00:55:07.294 --> 00:55:10.237]  And you just can't sit there and let them commit these crimes.
[00:55:10.597 --> 00:55:11.678]  This is not a government.
[00:55:12.018 --> 00:55:13.119]  This is a group of criminals.
[00:55:14.721 --> 00:55:15.321]  We're going to go to break.
[00:55:16.041 --> 00:55:20.703]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:55:20.723 --> 00:55:21.183]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:55:21.563 --> 00:55:25.224]  First-time callers on the Mueller Report, what you think's coming next.
[00:55:25.764 --> 00:55:27.665]  That's the topic we're covering.
[00:55:27.685 --> 00:55:28.825]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:55:30.965 --> 00:55:32.266]  And I haven't plugged any of this hour.
[00:55:32.746 --> 00:55:33.426]  Look, it's simple.
[00:55:34.146 --> 00:55:35.227]  And God always comes through.
[00:55:35.287 --> 00:55:41.028]  But, you know, I sell 300 t-shirts a day with this special, and we're making like $5 on them.
[00:55:41.068 --> 00:55:42.028]  That's not going to pay the bills.
[00:55:42.188 --> 00:55:43.729]  The bandwidth alone costs that every day.
[00:55:44.451 --> 00:55:52.274]  And I've gotten this trap that marketers, I don't have any degree in marketing, but marketers warned me years ago, they said, you keep only marking stuff up 100% and then you discount it.
[00:55:53.094 --> 00:55:54.435]  People are going to expect sales all the time.
[00:55:54.455 --> 00:55:55.495]  They're looking about and there's a sale.
[00:55:55.935 --> 00:55:58.816]  And then yeah, you move a lot of volume, but you don't make a lot of money.
[00:55:59.317 --> 00:56:00.897]  You need to stop doing sales all the time.
[00:56:00.917 --> 00:56:02.138]  Well, I got myself in that trap.
[00:56:02.178 --> 00:56:04.238]  That's just the way it is.
[00:56:04.258 --> 00:56:13.502]  50% off all the apparel, ball caps, t-shirts, go buy a bunch of it and give it as a gift or wear it yourself or go give it to the
[00:56:14.858 --> 00:56:15.161]  Thank you.
[00:56:16.317 --> 00:56:18.218]  Salvation Army or Goodwill.
[00:56:18.478 --> 00:56:19.739]  It's a walking billboard.
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:21.741]  Give it to your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[00:56:22.001 --> 00:56:22.781]  A Molon Lobby.
[00:56:22.821 --> 00:56:23.822]  Attorney Response Team shirt.
[00:56:24.102 --> 00:56:25.263]  You meet like-minded people.
[00:56:25.303 --> 00:56:26.044]  This is how you do it.
[00:56:26.684 --> 00:56:27.424]  You do this once a year.
[00:56:27.885 --> 00:56:28.365]  50% off apparel.
[00:56:28.825 --> 00:56:29.746]  We've got DNA Force.
[00:56:29.766 --> 00:56:32.968]  Even though it's close to selling out, I'm still offering it at 20% off.
[00:56:33.008 --> 00:56:33.989]  Read all the amazing reviews.
[00:56:34.009 --> 00:56:34.549]  DNA Force.
[00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:36.430]  We have the best food deal ever.
[00:56:36.591 --> 00:56:37.691]  It's My Patriot Supply.
[00:56:38.012 --> 00:56:40.893]  Private label so I can go at cost and get around their contracts.
[00:56:40.933 --> 00:56:41.614]  They allow me to do that.
[00:56:41.634 --> 00:56:45.917]  It's a two-week food supply in a very nice big plastic tote container.
[00:56:46.537 --> 00:56:47.298]  We're good to go.
[00:56:47.338 --> 00:56:48.639]  We're good to go.
[00:56:48.679 --> 00:56:49.320]  We're good to go.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.141]  We're good to go.
[00:57:03.093 --> 00:57:05.256]  Uh, leading competitors cost $500.
[00:57:05.316 --> 00:57:06.377]  It usually costs $250.
[00:57:06.718 --> 00:57:07.719]  It's $200 right now.
[00:57:07.879 --> 00:57:08.860]  That is a great deal.
[00:57:09.381 --> 00:57:11.544]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site.

[00:57:28.593 --> 00:57:29.134]  Canceling time.
[00:57:29.174 --> 00:57:29.814]  That way it comes.

[00:57:43.439 --> 00:57:46.820]  We've already had some incredible victories together, but the biggest are yet to come.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:47.840]  Your calls.
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:48.420]  It's on the news.
[00:57:48.481 --> 00:57:48.941]  Straight ahead.
[00:57:49.021 --> 00:57:49.521]  Hour number two.
[00:57:52.947 --> 00:57:54.268]  All generations live in you now.
[00:57:57.289 --> 00:58:02.552]  But this is your fight.
[00:58:02.652 --> 00:58:06.694]  Yes, it is.
[00:58:07.434 --> 00:58:11.896]  I will see it through the tears.
[00:58:15.238 --> 00:58:20.821]  Oh, it's gorgeous.
[00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:25.952]  Oh, what's going on?
[00:58:25.992 --> 00:58:34.161]  What is it?
[00:58:34.321 --> 00:58:36.223]  Oh, boy!
[00:58:49.002 --> 00:58:49.322]  What do you mean?
[00:58:49.342 --> 00:58:49.622]  What happened?
[00:58:49.642 --> 00:58:49.822]  Oh my god!
[00:58:49.842 --> 00:58:50.322]  I'll always be with you.
[00:58:50.342 --> 00:58:50.903]  No one's ever really gone.
[00:58:50.963 --> 00:58:51.043]  What?
[00:59:18.047 --> 00:59:18.447]  No!
[00:59:18.528 --> 00:59:27.894]  The Emperor!
[00:59:28.355 --> 00:59:30.956]  Skywalker!
[00:59:31.197 --> 00:59:31.597]  Yes!
[00:59:32.458 --> 00:59:34.359]  Oh my god!
[00:59:34.439 --> 00:59:37.281]  How do they make this more and more epic every time?
[00:59:37.381 --> 00:59:39.743]  Silent free these people!
[00:59:46.624 --> 00:59:51.889]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:00:36.846 --> 01:00:38.447]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:00:38.467 --> 01:00:41.488]  3 p.m.
[01:00:41.528 --> 01:00:42.108]  we're here live.
[01:00:42.168 --> 01:00:43.169]  David Knight's on at 8 a.m.
[01:00:43.189 --> 01:00:43.789]  Doing a great job.
[01:00:43.809 --> 01:00:44.509]  So is Owen Shroyer.
[01:00:44.529 --> 01:00:45.010]  3 p.m.
[01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:45.670]  Central every day.
[01:00:47.171 --> 01:00:47.871]  Those great guys.
[01:00:47.891 --> 01:00:48.531]  So good to know them.
[01:00:53.573 --> 01:00:54.694]  But you know, being in this fight...
[01:00:55.538 --> 01:00:58.680]  I hate myself sometimes when I want to say something or do something better.
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.762]  I get really mad at myself.
[01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:03.524]  You know, I really respect David and he's smarter than I am in many ways.
[01:01:03.544 --> 01:01:05.225]  I really respect Owen.
[01:01:05.265 --> 01:01:07.247]  He's more passionate and smarter in many ways.
[01:01:07.707 --> 01:01:10.029]  I'll be watching them when they're doing their shows, getting mad at them.
[01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:13.191]  Like, you should do this, you should do that.
[01:01:13.351 --> 01:01:14.472]  And it has nothing to do with them.
[01:01:15.273 --> 01:01:22.438]  I'm projecting my own boiling, it's like a dog chewing on a cage that it's entrapped in.
[01:01:22.458 --> 01:01:23.399]  It's just biting at it.
[01:01:24.434 --> 01:01:27.375]  And there's that frustration, and we can't let the enemy wear us down.
[01:01:27.415 --> 01:01:28.936]  We cannot overheat.
[01:01:29.516 --> 01:01:34.879]  We have to just trust in God, and just keep working, and just keep focusing, and we're gonna win.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.441]  And most nations don't get this type of quick reprieve.
[01:01:39.761 --> 01:01:40.462]  We're not there yet.
[01:01:41.722 --> 01:01:48.205]  But God's showing us, listen, you've been given special dispensation.
[01:01:48.325 --> 01:01:51.627]  You've been given the golden ticket, but you have to take the birthright.
[01:01:52.398 --> 01:01:56.360]  It's just like the prophets would tell Israel every time Israel turned against God and became wicked.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:59.921]  The devil was focusing on Israel because Israel had the birthright.
[01:02:00.261 --> 01:02:01.682]  So Israel did a lot of wicked things.
[01:02:02.822 --> 01:02:13.046]  Not because Israel was evil at heart, but because Israel had the birthright, the devil was focusing all his power on them.
[01:02:15.007 --> 01:02:21.650]  And make no mistake, America is under attack from without him, from within.
[01:02:23.391 --> 01:02:26.312]  And we don't say that as victims, we say that as overcomers.
[01:02:27.373 --> 01:02:30.414]  We have to be honest with ourselves about that.
[01:02:30.554 --> 01:02:31.655]  Yes.
[01:02:31.755 --> 01:02:38.018]  I feel like I should be popping champagne.
[01:02:38.038 --> 01:02:44.721]  I feel like I should be celebrating, except, okay, they didn't totally rout us this time.
[01:02:45.381 --> 01:02:47.302]  We fought back from the grave.
[01:02:50.570 --> 01:02:57.314]  And now they're reforming to come at us, which makes these victories that much sweeter, but also that much more painful.
[01:02:57.934 --> 01:03:08.939]  Because when America's come back from the dead that many times, when we've been given providence and God's discernment so many times, it makes it that much more precious.
[01:03:08.979 --> 01:03:13.542]  You know, it's like a child you have that gets sick when they're little and almost dies.
[01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:26.303]  You may have five or six other children, but that one little daughter, that one little son that almost died, that you stayed up with all night, all those weeks, you'll always love them more than the others.
[01:03:31.846 --> 01:03:32.447]  Think about that.
[01:03:35.488 --> 01:03:36.429]  That's the prodigal son.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.702]  The firstborn son says, I never did anything wrong.
[01:03:42.722 --> 01:03:43.743]  I always did what I was told.
[01:03:43.803 --> 01:03:44.744]  I was steadfast.
[01:03:45.124 --> 01:03:51.090]  And you're spending all your money and your time welcoming back this other son that's been gone for 10 years and took his birthright early.
[01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:54.073]  And it was a total thug and an embarrassment to us.
[01:03:54.313 --> 01:04:00.539]  And now you just welcome him back and have the biggest party we've ever had and give all the employees bonuses and kill the best cow we've got.
[01:04:00.599 --> 01:04:01.820]  And what the hell?
[01:04:02.661 --> 01:04:03.682]  And the father looks at him and says,
[01:04:06.664 --> 01:04:08.525]  Can you imagine what I'd do for you?
[01:04:09.485 --> 01:04:10.906]  This is the failed son.
[01:04:10.926 --> 01:04:11.786]  It means that much.
[01:04:13.086 --> 01:04:15.647]  It's expected that you're gonna perform.
[01:04:17.028 --> 01:04:19.689]  I love you ten times more than that failed son.
[01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:26.091]  This is a celebration that we didn't lose this one.
[01:04:27.632 --> 01:04:28.952]  But you are a leader.
[01:04:29.912 --> 01:04:31.273]  And you will carry on the house.
[01:04:33.311 --> 01:04:40.335]  And so you don't need little petty parties or medals or to be praised by the system for doing the right thing.
[01:04:41.576 --> 01:04:45.438]  You're the firstborn and you're in charge because you are in charge.
[01:04:46.959 --> 01:04:52.602]  It's this fallen son that we have to rejoice came back because we almost lost him.
[01:04:54.143 --> 01:04:55.264]  Don't you understand now?
[01:04:56.385 --> 01:04:57.786]  Stay with us, your calls are straight ahead.
[01:05:05.637 --> 01:05:06.641]  Please don't forget, we have.

[01:05:11.007 --> 01:05:12.448]  We still have store-wide free shipping.
[01:05:12.808 --> 01:05:15.049]  We had to end all those big discounts on the supplements.
[01:05:15.069 --> 01:05:20.951]  We're about to sell out of all of them, but we still have a big discount going, even though it's about to sell out on DNA Force, our flagship, amazing product.
[01:05:21.031 --> 01:05:21.892]  Check out DNA Force.

[01:05:58.509 --> 01:06:00.590]  It's discounted, but it's about to sell out.
[01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:01.150]  We'll be right back.
[01:06:34.187 --> 01:06:36.348]  See the generals gathered in their masses.
[01:06:37.509 --> 01:06:39.410]  Just like witches at black masses.
[01:06:40.751 --> 01:06:42.312]  In the fields, the bodies burning.
[01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:45.134]  As the war machine keeps turning.
[01:06:45.154 --> 01:06:49.456]  Sorcerers of death's construction.
[01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:05.431]  How do you really kill somebody?
[01:07:07.352 --> 01:07:10.293]  You kill them softly, where they never know what hit them.
[01:07:11.314 --> 01:07:25.201]  Bottom of the hour, I'm gonna hit that emergency public service announcement that if you care about yourself, you care about your neighbors, you care about the future, you care about your pension funds, you'll want to tune in for that.
[01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:30.744]  See, there's different stories out there about the
[01:07:33.303 --> 01:07:36.025]  Round that they produced for the Colt M16.
[01:07:37.705 --> 01:07:39.566]  What is that, the 556 or 223?
[01:07:40.607 --> 01:07:49.912]  But they said that it would wound people instead of killing them, and that would sap more of the enemy's resources.
[01:07:51.213 --> 01:08:01.018]  Now, whether that story is true or not, that gives you a little bird's eye view and a window into the globalist thinking, because whether that's true or not,
[01:08:01.892 --> 01:08:03.633]  And historians debate back and forth.
[01:08:03.833 --> 01:08:06.834]  I'm really not even a novice when it comes to gun history.
[01:08:06.894 --> 01:08:09.376]  I know how to shoot them, but that's about it.
[01:08:09.436 --> 01:08:17.940]  I know how to hit the target, but the whole nomenclature of it, I'm not really up to snuff on.
[01:08:19.921 --> 01:08:26.384]  But you see, soft kill's a real thing, and folks should know about it.
[01:08:29.718 --> 01:08:39.361]  Because even if you're not having children, all of the mentally retarded and brain damaged children that we're having to pay for and deal with are something that could be fixed real quick.
[01:08:40.881 --> 01:08:51.244]  But see, there's a project going on that the globalists are panicking if Trump becomes full president and gets into that are going to get turned around and stopped.
[01:08:52.425 --> 01:08:54.805]  Oh, the Chinese don't have this autism problem.
[01:08:55.686 --> 01:08:56.806]  The Russians don't have it.
[01:08:58.817 --> 01:09:03.161]  By the way, any country that doesn't use glyphosate doesn't have it.
[01:09:05.343 --> 01:09:07.104]  You're probably going to say, wait, I thought vaccines did it.
[01:09:10.167 --> 01:09:11.868]  It's called binary weapons.
[01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:18.634]  And then they've got other weapons that aren't just two different systems that together create the compound that kills you.
[01:09:19.515 --> 01:09:26.441]  They have weapons, sometimes up to six, before they start breaking down and not having the desired effect.
[01:09:28.166 --> 01:09:41.135]  Vaccines are a binary adjuvant trigger for fluoride plaques and plaques associated with glyphosate.
[01:09:41.735 --> 01:09:55.985]  The body builds up and blocks and then the vaccine triggers an autoimmune response that causes swelling in the brain that then breaks the barrier and then the full dose is delivered.
[01:09:57.130 --> 01:09:58.691]  It's a binary weapon.
[01:10:02.134 --> 01:10:10.460]  So if you don't want to be changing your son's diapers until you go to the nursing home and he goes and gets euthanized, you might want to listen to me.
[01:10:12.162 --> 01:10:17.926]  Because I do this in a cold, evil voice, because that's the enemy's intent for you and your family.
[01:10:19.107 --> 01:10:21.349]  And you need to know they're spooky and they're bad.
[01:10:22.069 --> 01:10:22.790]  And they're the enemy.
[01:10:24.195 --> 01:10:27.177]  And the average doctor is compartmentalized and doesn't know about that.
[01:10:28.678 --> 01:10:30.019]  So you're going to have to be a leader now.
[01:10:32.481 --> 01:10:33.161]  That's coming up.
[01:10:34.702 --> 01:10:36.323]  But I've already burned part of this segment.
[01:10:36.924 --> 01:10:38.305]  Last segment of the hour, I'm going to hit it.
[01:10:40.086 --> 01:10:45.830]  And we're going to talk about something that... Can you stop them breaking the border?
[01:10:45.930 --> 01:10:48.311]  Can you stop crackheads that want to smoke crack?
[01:10:48.351 --> 01:10:51.874]  Can you stop Muslims wanting to blow themselves up?
[01:10:52.694 --> 01:10:53.135]  Maybe not.
[01:10:54.022 --> 01:10:55.222]  But you could talk to your neighbors.
[01:10:55.462 --> 01:10:57.283]  You could bring them the vaccine insert.
[01:10:57.823 --> 01:11:06.325]  You could spend some time on that instead of fantasy football or getting drunk down at the bar with your buddies that are all fake people and giggling and laughing at each other when none of it matters.
[01:11:09.046 --> 01:11:09.886]  You could do all that.
[01:11:10.546 --> 01:11:12.347]  And I know most of you are doing that.
[01:11:12.607 --> 01:11:17.608]  But I'm talking to new listeners that tune in and they go, man, Jones is the biggest comedian in the world.
[01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:20.269]  He's the funniest guy we've ever heard.
[01:11:23.493 --> 01:11:26.854]  There's millions of views on YouTube of me talking about the governor of Virginia.
[01:11:28.074 --> 01:11:32.055]  Discussing... Keeping babies alive.
[01:11:32.836 --> 01:11:34.016]  And killing them after they're born.
[01:11:34.036 --> 01:11:36.877]  And I say, keep them comfortable.
[01:11:38.117 --> 01:11:39.457]  Little flesh balls.
[01:11:43.699 --> 01:11:45.559]  And people think it's funny.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.120]  I only illustrated it because that's how the governor talks.
[01:11:50.801 --> 01:11:52.061]  And that's how sick it is.
[01:11:53.556 --> 01:11:54.997]  I didn't do it because it's funny.
[01:11:55.997 --> 01:11:57.238]  Now, you can laugh all day.
[01:12:00.079 --> 01:12:01.980]  And I'm not saying you're bad if you think it's funny.
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.361]  But this isn't entertainment.
[01:12:07.542 --> 01:12:10.464]  Now, you think you're safe when they can kill newborn babies.
[01:12:11.624 --> 01:12:16.126]  And we got these people, like this monster, walking around above ground.
[01:12:20.768 --> 01:12:21.709]  You don't have any instincts.
[01:12:24.383 --> 01:12:41.610]  The fact that the Democratic Party is publicly, in every state they control, getting laws passed to kill babies after they're born shows that they think you're in a trance.
[01:12:45.111 --> 01:12:50.034]  Anybody could investigate this sack of garbage and the biomedic companies that have given him money.
[01:12:50.254 --> 01:12:50.954]  I went and looked it up.
[01:12:53.018 --> 01:12:59.824]  Guess where this old medical doctor, that just so happens to be a pediatric doctor, got his funding from?
[01:13:00.705 --> 01:13:01.745]  Oh, it's real funny.
[01:13:01.765 --> 01:13:05.709]  Gee, he wants to keep babies alive and harvest their organs.
[01:13:09.144 --> 01:13:16.189]  If they get more money doing that, keeping them alive longer to get a higher price on the organ, you got them right there on the spot.
[01:13:16.209 --> 01:13:17.550]  There might not be a buyer right away.
[01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:25.636]  With some fresh goods, we take the blood, the organs, and we take the skin.
[01:13:27.217 --> 01:13:28.197]  But it's all right.
[01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:30.039]  It's a Southern loving voice.
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:34.222]  There's nothing wrong with Southern loving, is there?
[01:13:36.503 --> 01:13:38.925]  After all, we love the children.
[01:13:41.203 --> 01:13:46.846]  But another governor just vetoed a law that if a baby's already born, they can't kill it.
[01:13:47.167 --> 01:13:49.348]  There's already laws saying you can't kill that baby.
[01:13:50.028 --> 01:13:57.233]  But it's all a big power grab by the doctors, a power grab by the hospitals, by the medical groups.
[01:13:57.673 --> 01:14:02.376]  And they celebrate, sign these bills in New York, you name it, to kill the babies after they're born.
[01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:04.557]  Then they pass laws in North Carolina saying you won't do it.
[01:14:05.197 --> 01:14:07.639]  And the governor does the mind control and says, no, we will.
[01:14:07.679 --> 01:14:09.160]  There's already laws on murder.
[01:14:10.745 --> 01:14:12.125]  There's already laws on that.
[01:14:12.605 --> 01:14:16.506]  But it's a doctor, but it's a medical center.
[01:14:16.526 --> 01:14:18.867]  The police are like, well, are they allowed to?
[01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:24.148]  You see, they're using their white coats and their station like the Nazis did.
[01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:29.270]  The first sterilizations, executions were by doctors in the Third Reich in 1934.
[01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:38.432]  They're using that as the wedge, as the camel's nose under the tin flap, as the boot in the door.
[01:14:41.084 --> 01:14:42.825]  Let's begin the whole operation.
[01:14:45.547 --> 01:14:47.669]  And the mother decides if she wants it.
[01:14:47.869 --> 01:14:49.750]  If she wants it, we resuscitate.
[01:14:49.770 --> 01:14:51.872]  That's a legal term for them in bioethics.
[01:14:51.992 --> 01:14:52.773]  It's already alive.
[01:14:53.313 --> 01:14:56.355]  But we decide if it leads to live on.
[01:14:56.375 --> 01:14:59.718]  And then we say resuscitate or not.
[01:15:00.438 --> 01:15:03.901]  If we don't resuscitate the little blood bag,
[01:15:05.342 --> 01:15:21.936]  He's taken back and kept comfortable by all those orders for the liver, the lungs, the kidneys, the spleen, and then the fat, and the blood, and the skin, and it's all rendered down and sold.
[01:15:22.837 --> 01:15:25.719]  Then I get a big house and a big pool.
[01:15:26.979 --> 01:15:28.600]  And so much money.
[01:15:29.681 --> 01:15:33.063]  And we don't need to get the police or the government involved.
[01:15:33.163 --> 01:15:34.324]  Or fathers, he says.
[01:15:34.964 --> 01:15:36.425]  Men shouldn't be involved.
[01:15:36.485 --> 01:15:41.728]  It's the mothers with the doctors that will decide.
[01:15:42.508 --> 01:15:47.131]  While your woman's drugged up, we get her to sign the agreement.
[01:15:48.351 --> 01:15:53.614]  And then we take that little creature and we got some real good.
[01:15:54.974 --> 01:15:56.155]  We'll be back with your phone calls.
[01:15:56.235 --> 01:15:57.055]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:15:57.595 --> 01:15:58.896]  This is the Human Resistance.
[01:15:59.256 --> 01:16:02.898]  This is the InfoWar.
[01:16:04.879 --> 01:16:14.323]  I want to put forward an allegory or a story to explain where I'm coming from that parallels current real-time reality.
[01:16:14.764 --> 01:16:17.245]  So please, bear with me a few minutes.
[01:16:18.732 --> 01:16:24.513]  Because this is just bubbling up from my own thought processes of why am I sitting here with my shirt off.
[01:16:25.353 --> 01:16:27.374]  I want to be crystal clear with everybody.
[01:16:29.154 --> 01:16:40.216]  What I'm about to say is not about putting down California like we're different football teams and we're talking about the University of Texas versus UCLA.
[01:16:41.497 --> 01:16:42.017]  This is not
[01:16:43.473 --> 01:16:45.835]  Alex Jones is a tribalist going, woo!
[01:16:46.255 --> 01:16:48.017]  Texas is way better than California.
[01:16:48.257 --> 01:16:49.018]  F-California.
[01:16:50.459 --> 01:16:54.863]  California, until about 30 years ago, was undoubtedly the best state in the Union.
[01:16:56.044 --> 01:17:00.527]  It was more Texan than Texans because it was the last big frontier state.
[01:17:01.168 --> 01:17:02.709]  The 49ers, all of it.
[01:17:02.769 --> 01:17:05.972]  I mean, the history books I've read about it have been incredible.
[01:17:07.373 --> 01:17:11.116]  It was deep red until just about 25 years ago.
[01:17:13.422 --> 01:17:23.205]  The Democrats came in, they opened the borders, they engineered the state, they created socialism, dependency, and now the state is a skeleton of its former self.
[01:17:24.525 --> 01:17:30.867]  And now Beto and others have set their sights to turn Texas blue, and most political experts agree,
[01:17:33.222 --> 01:17:35.964]  24.
[01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:35.964]  Texas will be deep blue.
[01:17:36.904 --> 01:17:38.505]  My fellow Texans are in a coma.
[01:17:38.965 --> 01:17:46.128]  But, as Kennedy said, and as Eisenhower said, and as Nixon said, and as Reagan said, as goes Texas, so goes the nation.
[01:17:46.368 --> 01:17:49.170]  It's been like that since the Civil War.
[01:17:50.610 --> 01:17:51.491]  That's a whole other history book.
[01:17:52.531 --> 01:18:00.755]  And so the fall of California, and it's a big gaping hole in our defenses for the collapse of Latin America, it's not a positive thing.
[01:18:02.432 --> 01:18:03.793]  It's not something I celebrate.
[01:18:03.813 --> 01:18:05.315]  It's like whistling past the graveyard.
[01:18:05.415 --> 01:18:16.565]  But, the carpetbaggers from all over the country that went to California, because it was the best state 30 years ago, who aren't Californians, they ruined that incredible state.
[01:18:17.346 --> 01:18:19.368]  They destroyed that incredible state.
[01:18:20.865 --> 01:18:29.630]  And now like locusts, or piranhas, or Nazi U-Boat wolf packs, they have come to Texas to ruin our state.
[01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:47.501]  We have 10 different amazing t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com, like this Don't California, Buy USA flag t-shirt at InfoWarsTore.com that are great attention grabbers and conversation starters no matter where you live.
[01:18:48.607 --> 01:18:57.249]  In the country, because if the Democrats can take down Texas and Florida, it's over, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:58.533 --> 01:19:03.077]  The globalists want InfoWars shut down because they can track back.
[01:19:03.177 --> 01:19:05.079]  Almost all their defeats are to what we do.
[01:19:05.799 --> 01:19:08.642]  I instinctively know how to defeat them, just like you do.
[01:19:08.942 --> 01:19:09.883]  Probably resonate together.
[01:19:10.503 --> 01:19:13.546]  And I'm telling you, this don't California, my USA.
[01:19:13.886 --> 01:19:16.549]  This don't California, my Texas is the answer.
[01:19:16.809 --> 01:19:18.010]  But people have to be warned.
[01:19:18.610 --> 01:19:22.954]  We have 10 different limited edition shirts at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:23.455 --> 01:19:25.756]  Right now for men and women in all the sizes.
[01:19:26.417 --> 01:19:28.257]  And I want this to be a major movement.
[01:19:29.218 --> 01:19:33.418]  And so, for the next week or so, while supplies last, 50% off.
[01:19:34.079 --> 01:19:38.039]  That means I'm making 5 bucks from these shirts that funds the InfoWars.
[01:19:38.079 --> 01:19:44.321]  So spread the word, meet like-minded people, cause a debate, become a billboard for liberty and freedom today.
[01:19:44.341 --> 01:19:50.262]  InfoWarsStore.com and look at the 10 limited edition
[01:19:51.365 --> 01:19:53.948]  Don't California my USA, don't California Texas.
[01:19:54.488 --> 01:19:56.370]  I welcome folks to say don't California Florida.
[01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:59.093]  Let's just get this going nationwide and let's win again.
[01:19:59.413 --> 01:20:00.795]  We can do it if we take action.
[01:20:00.995 --> 01:20:02.196]  We can save America.
[01:20:06.401 --> 01:20:09.023]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:26.993 --> 01:20:29.395]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:20:29.455 --> 01:20:31.757]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:20:31.797 --> 01:20:32.978]  Mao took the guns.
[01:20:33.038 --> 01:20:34.879]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[01:20:34.919 --> 01:20:36.341]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[01:20:36.361 --> 01:20:39.663]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[01:20:56.630 --> 01:20:59.591]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:20:59.691 --> 01:21:10.236]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny of the mind of man.
[01:21:10.296 --> 01:21:11.617]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:21:11.857 --> 01:21:14.118]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:21:40.199 --> 01:21:42.460]  Alright, I'm going to go to your calls, bam bam bam, right now.
[01:21:43.441 --> 01:21:47.964]  And then coming up, we're going to get into all over the country.
[01:21:47.984 --> 01:21:50.646]  Democrats are passing laws to kill babies after they're born.
[01:21:51.586 --> 01:21:53.568]  And law enforcement's asking, well, how late?
[01:21:53.588 --> 01:21:55.009]  Could it be a 75-year-old man?
[01:21:55.029 --> 01:21:55.889]  Democrats are like, no.
[01:21:56.369 --> 01:21:59.051]  If the hospital says you're a baby and you're 75, they're going to kill you.
[01:21:59.231 --> 01:22:00.192]  I'm not joking.
[01:22:00.852 --> 01:22:07.417]  So it's hospitals making law, it's eugenics, it's population reduction, it's euthanasia.
[01:22:08.959 --> 01:22:09.640]  And so here it is.
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.241]  They're making their move.
[01:22:11.261 --> 01:22:12.703]  The ex-DEA head, U.S.
[01:22:12.723 --> 01:22:13.584]  border collapsing.
[01:22:13.624 --> 01:22:14.284]  We'll get into that.
[01:22:14.985 --> 01:22:18.568]  Proposed new Texas law would demand safety studies for vaccines.
[01:22:18.608 --> 01:22:20.350]  You didn't know they didn't have safety studies?
[01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:21.551]  I'm going to get into all of that.
[01:22:22.052 --> 01:22:27.537]  Top progressive pundits and mainstream Democrats are worried about Bernie Sanders winning the White House in 2020.
[01:22:28.934 --> 01:22:31.015]  And turning us into Venezuela?
[01:22:31.935 --> 01:22:33.455]  I will do that for you.
[01:22:33.956 --> 01:22:39.217]  Never had a real job, but I run things so that is how it is.
[01:22:39.777 --> 01:22:42.478]  That is all coming up and more.
[01:22:43.139 --> 01:22:48.400]  But right now, we've got Bayer in Wisconsin or Washington.
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:50.821]  We've got Berger in California.
[01:22:50.841 --> 01:22:51.961]  We've got Danny in Virginia.
[01:22:52.021 --> 01:22:52.722]  Jack in Indiana.
[01:22:53.122 --> 01:22:53.922]  Jimmy in Maine.
[01:22:54.282 --> 01:22:55.142]  Frank in Michigan.
[01:22:55.222 --> 01:22:56.183]  Jacob in Kansas.
[01:22:56.263 --> 01:22:57.063]  Gary in Virginia.
[01:22:58.137 --> 01:23:06.724]  Brian in Pennsylvania, Mark in Colorado, David in Florida, and many, many, many others.
[01:23:07.465 --> 01:23:10.187]  And so I think the best way to start this is who's been holding the longest.
[01:23:10.848 --> 01:23:21.297]  Let's go ahead without further ado, with no drumroll, and let's go ahead and talk to Frank in Michigan.
[01:23:21.317 --> 01:23:22.377]  Frank, thanks for calling.
[01:23:22.398 --> 01:23:22.678]  Go ahead.
[01:23:24.915 --> 01:23:28.818]  Hey, I wanted to comment about the future of the InfoWars operation.
[01:23:30.059 --> 01:23:38.904]  And the comment that I have is that you have some really strong people that are working for you now, but you had some people in the past that were as well.
[01:23:39.205 --> 01:23:41.826]  And I'm talking right now like of Greg Reese.
[01:23:42.627 --> 01:23:51.393]  And I think that he should be the model going forward for the rest of your reporters, the freelancers, the Katelins, the Millies,
[01:23:52.023 --> 01:23:53.444]  Enough with the troll videos.
[01:23:53.844 --> 01:24:00.127]  It's time for InfoWars to return to originating journalism like you were back in the day.
[01:24:00.708 --> 01:24:08.312]  Not having a political bent, but being far more objective and educating.
[01:24:08.352 --> 01:24:14.755]  And I think if you guys wouldn't have hacked out in the last election for Trump, that you probably wouldn't be in the crosshairs.
[01:24:15.464 --> 01:24:17.527]  That you probably wouldn't have been looked at.
[01:24:17.547 --> 01:24:18.127]  Well, I better not.
[01:24:18.588 --> 01:24:20.971]  I want out of the crosshairs, so I better abandon Trump.
[01:24:21.391 --> 01:24:23.514]  Man, we're getting nationalists elected.
[01:24:23.554 --> 01:24:24.555]  Doesn't mean Trump's perfect.
[01:24:24.815 --> 01:24:27.178]  We finally got somebody that'll do what they say they're gonna do.
[01:24:27.559 --> 01:24:32.565]  I'm supporting nationalists getting elected all over the world here, so I want to be in the crosshairs.
[01:24:33.586 --> 01:24:34.407]  I mean, you understand.
[01:24:35.456 --> 01:24:37.198]  I'm not trying to get out of the crosshairs.
[01:24:37.958 --> 01:24:42.582]  See, because they announced how I failed, how I'm being taken off, all this stuff like, oh look, he's a failure.
[01:24:42.602 --> 01:24:44.184]  Oh God, I better not support him.
[01:24:44.504 --> 01:24:45.104]  I'll get banned.
[01:24:45.525 --> 01:24:46.926]  This is called leadership.
[01:24:47.486 --> 01:24:54.172]  I am not pleased they're trying to censor us and blocking us in ways, but I'm pleased that we were so effective they did it.
[01:24:55.053 --> 01:24:58.496]  So I hired Greg Rees, and I wish I had more money to hire more people.
[01:24:59.456 --> 01:25:15.264]  And and so we're doing a lot of things a lot of reporters and a lot of stuff here And I'm not mad at you calling up saying what you want to hear what you want to see but at the same time like we Greg Reese is awesome, and he makes great videos, and he's here and so See what I mean.
[01:25:15.304 --> 01:25:23.969]  I mean how you're like telling me why you do more of we're doing it right and that's awesome, and I wanted to and I know that this I'm not trying to
[01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:27.960]  You're not getting on my nerves.
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.741]  Hold on just a second.
[01:25:29.961 --> 01:25:32.303]  You can tell me what you want, Frank.
[01:25:34.825 --> 01:25:40.728]  But you say you might not have been in the crosshairs so much if you'd have been a little bit better.
[01:25:41.489 --> 01:25:44.071]  I'm not doing what I do to stay out of the crosshairs.
[01:25:44.671 --> 01:25:47.193]  I want you to get that mindset going here for you.
[01:25:47.573 --> 01:25:49.014]  I want to be in the crosshairs.
[01:25:49.894 --> 01:25:50.815]  Like John Hancock.
[01:25:51.215 --> 01:25:53.417]  Why do you think John Hancock on the Declaration of Independence
[01:25:54.605 --> 01:25:59.088]  July 4th, 1776, signed his name five times bigger than all the other names.
[01:25:59.148 --> 01:25:59.628]  Why'd he do that?
[01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:04.052]  Of course, he's trying to call attention to himself.
[01:26:05.933 --> 01:26:07.434]  Oh, signing it was a death warrant.
[01:26:08.915 --> 01:26:10.796]  He was saying, I'm going over the top.
[01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:11.817]  I'm totally committed.
[01:26:12.878 --> 01:26:15.900]  Like, that was a middle finger to the King of England.
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.001]  You know the King of England was shown a copy of that.
[01:26:18.021 --> 01:26:20.483]  And the King of England said, who's John Hancock?
[01:26:20.723 --> 01:26:21.764]  He's number one to be killed.
[01:26:22.546 --> 01:26:24.869]  And John Hancock had some of his family killed, you name it.
[01:26:25.190 --> 01:26:25.991]  Lost everything he had.
[01:26:26.312 --> 01:26:27.413]  That's what this is all about, brother.
[01:26:27.693 --> 01:26:33.522]  So, when you call up and say, hey dude, you might not want to put yourself on the radar, I am John Hancock reborn.
[01:26:33.802 --> 01:26:34.163]  Understand?
[01:26:35.515 --> 01:26:37.757]  Listen to me, Frank!
[01:26:37.817 --> 01:26:39.698]  Do you understand me?
[01:26:40.278 --> 01:26:42.240]  I'm not mad at you criticizing me.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.181]  I'm attacking the New York Times every day.
[01:26:44.201 --> 01:26:46.483]  I want you to know my spirit, Frank.
[01:26:46.803 --> 01:26:47.743]  I want you to understand it.
[01:26:47.803 --> 01:26:49.124]  I want you to learn it.
[01:26:49.785 --> 01:26:51.766]  I want to be in the crosshairs, Frank.
[01:26:51.886 --> 01:26:53.247]  I seek the crosshairs.
[01:26:53.767 --> 01:26:54.788]  I will follow it to the end.
[01:26:56.249 --> 01:27:01.632]  So please don't tell me about courses of action that lead me into the system being nice to me.
[01:27:01.932 --> 01:27:03.793]  I do not seek them to be nice to me.
[01:27:03.873 --> 01:27:04.873]  I seek war.
[01:27:04.893 --> 01:27:12.357]  I seek, like John Paul Jones said, I only want the fastest and quickest and most deadly ships to lead me into action.
[01:27:12.377 --> 01:27:14.378]  Now do you understand, Frank?
[01:27:15.938 --> 01:27:18.439]  Geez, yes, I understand where you're coming from.
[01:27:18.459 --> 01:27:19.460]  Let me hear your war growl!
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:21.201]  Let me hear your war growl, Frank!
[01:27:32.516 --> 01:27:33.857]  Give me war, Frank!
[01:27:34.898 --> 01:27:38.320]  Steer me into war against these pedophiles and devil worshippers!
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:39.841]  Give me war!
[01:27:40.442 --> 01:27:42.043]  I want to be in the crosshairs!
[01:27:42.964 --> 01:27:43.984]  Now you understand, don't you?
[01:27:45.125 --> 01:27:46.306]  What else would you like, Frank?
[01:27:46.806 --> 01:27:47.947]  What else would you like, Frank?
[01:27:47.967 --> 01:27:49.448]  Aaron Dyke.
[01:27:49.788 --> 01:27:52.991]  Give us both of those guys working a one-two knockout punch.
[01:27:54.108 --> 01:27:58.672]  Aaron Dyche was a smart, nice guy.
[01:27:58.692 --> 01:27:59.132]  He quit.
[01:27:59.312 --> 01:28:00.853]  He went off with his girlfriend to do his own thing.
[01:28:00.873 --> 01:28:01.334]  Good for him.
[01:28:01.354 --> 01:28:04.116]  Again, you're not in the middle of this.
[01:28:04.196 --> 01:28:05.637]  You don't know what goes on behind the scenes here.
[01:28:06.117 --> 01:28:06.618]  But I hear you.
[01:28:07.338 --> 01:28:07.698]  You're right.
[01:28:07.858 --> 01:28:08.459]  I built this.
[01:28:08.539 --> 01:28:09.980]  I had a lot of reporters come through here.
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:11.601]  Most of them can't handle the pressure.
[01:28:11.761 --> 01:28:12.302]  I love them to death.
[01:28:13.601 --> 01:28:15.662]  Okay, but you do not know what you speak, Frank.
[01:28:15.742 --> 01:28:16.463]  I appreciate your call.
[01:28:17.423 --> 01:28:21.425]  I wonder if we have more callers that can tell me when we come back how I stay out of the fight.
[01:28:21.986 --> 01:28:24.127]  You know, Alex, things may have gone a little bit better for you.
[01:28:26.668 --> 01:28:28.449]  Why don't I just go endorse Hillary Clinton then?
[01:28:28.489 --> 01:28:30.890]  I bet I could be like the Young Turks or 50 times bigger.
[01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:40.736]  It's just the blindness, the spiritual blindness of saying to me, if you just played ball, you wouldn't be under attack.
[01:28:41.036 --> 01:28:41.236]  What?
[01:28:45.969 --> 01:28:51.976]  I just, I just, I... It's just bizarre to see how blind people are.
[01:28:53.297 --> 01:28:54.278]  InfoWars.com.
[01:28:54.298 --> 01:28:56.120]  Tomorrow's news today, your call to read after the break.
[01:29:05.746 --> 01:29:06.467]  There is a mission.
[01:29:06.847 --> 01:29:08.728]  I'm asking you to accept it and take action.
[01:29:08.889 --> 01:29:14.233]  We've had such a huge effect over the years with our t-shirts, but we haven't had a hit t-shirt over a year.
[01:29:14.353 --> 01:29:22.079]  Yeah, we sell a few hundred here, a few thousand there, but when we had 50,000 Hillary for Prisoners shirts on the street, or Obama, Joker, 100,000 on the street.
[01:29:22.319 --> 01:29:24.900]  It changed the world, and it funded the InfoWar.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.161]  All of our apparel is 50% off.
[01:29:27.741 --> 01:29:31.122]  That's all the t-shirts, all the ball caps, all everything.
[01:29:31.282 --> 01:29:39.785]  So, again, I would encourage listeners to understand, if you're on a right-wing or nationalist area, you'll get pats on the back, a cup of coffee probably bought before you wear an InfoWar shirt, meet a lot of like-minded people.
[01:29:39.865 --> 01:29:40.485]  It's a real adventure.
[01:29:40.565 --> 01:29:42.346]  But if you're in a leftist area, they don't speak Latin.
[01:29:42.406 --> 01:29:42.866]  We're good to go.
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:05.063]  But you know, our audience really doesn't run.
[01:30:05.203 --> 01:30:13.955]  So I made all these t-shirts that don't have InfoWars on them, and people like them, but nothing like they do the ones that are loud and proud, InfoWars.com, or that Trump Medusa t-shirt's my favorite.
[01:30:14.015 --> 01:30:19.462]  But the best-selling is the in-your-face, big, bright red InfoWars.com shirt.
[01:30:19.562 --> 01:30:20.824]  That's the one everybody wants.
[01:30:21.084 --> 01:30:31.050]  Right there, we have the Don't Tread On Me, we have Mean Like A Wolverine, we have a bunch of great ball caps, 1776, 50% off all apparel, and they point out it's annual.
[01:30:31.150 --> 01:30:33.711]  We've not done this, I looked it up, in over a year.
[01:30:33.911 --> 01:30:37.594]  Listen, the dollar isn't what it used to be, but everything is 50% off.
[01:30:37.614 --> 01:30:41.256]  We go and look at what the purchase order is, what it was, and give you literally 50% off.
[01:30:41.596 --> 01:30:46.739]  This is the best time, and these shirts freak the leftist out, the globalist out, and it helps fund this great operation.
[01:30:46.939 --> 01:30:47.759]  All apparel, 50% off.
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:51.705]  And InfoWarsTore.com haven't done this in over a year.
[01:30:51.945 --> 01:30:56.052]  InfoWarsTore.com takes you right there at 888-253-3139.
[01:30:56.152 --> 01:30:59.277]  Wear your colors loud and proud at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:03.339 --> 01:31:06.201]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified.
[01:31:06.221 --> 01:31:07.402]  1776 will come yet again if you try to take my firearms!
[01:31:07.422 --> 01:31:08.103]  That man is Alex Jones.
[01:31:08.143 --> 01:31:09.844]  He's one of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:10.945]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[01:31:10.965 --> 01:31:11.225]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:11.365 --> 01:31:11.766]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:11.786 --> 01:31:11.986]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:12.026 --> 01:31:12.306]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:12.326 --> 01:31:12.626]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:12.646 --> 01:31:12.887]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:12.907 --> 01:31:13.127]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:13.147 --> 01:31:13.487]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:13.547 --> 01:31:13.987]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:14.007 --> 01:31:14.248]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:14.268 --> 01:31:14.708]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:14.728 --> 01:31:15.028]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:15.088 --> 01:31:15.308]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:15.328 --> 01:31:15.589]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:15.609 --> 01:31:15.829]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:15.849 --> 01:31:16.069]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:16.089 --> 01:31:16.349]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:16.449 --> 01:31:16.970]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:16.990 --> 01:31:17.330]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.570]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:17.830]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:17.850 --> 01:31:18.151]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:18.211 --> 01:31:18.711]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:18.811 --> 01:31:19.532]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:19.752 --> 01:31:20.372]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:20.412 --> 01:31:20.693]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:20.713 --> 01:31:21.333]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:21.513 --> 01:31:22.034]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:22.054 --> 01:31:22.334]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:22.354 --> 01:31:22.754]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:22.774 --> 01:31:23.475]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:23.495 --> 01:31:23.695]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:23.715 --> 01:31:24.115]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:24.135 --> 01:31:24.336]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:24.356 --> 01:31:24.576]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:24.596 --> 01:31:24.796]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:24.816 --> 01:31:25.336]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:25.356 --> 01:31:25.597]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:25.617 --> 01:31:25.937]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:25.957 --> 01:31:26.157]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:26.177 --> 01:31:26.377]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:26.417 --> 01:31:26.657]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:26.677 --> 01:31:26.938]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:26.958 --> 01:31:27.178]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:27.238 --> 01:31:27.538]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:27.638 --> 01:31:27.898]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:27.918 --> 01:31:28.139]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:28.199 --> 01:31:28.439]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:28.459 --> 01:31:28.759]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:28.779 --> 01:31:28.979]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:28.999 --> 01:31:29.279]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:29.299 --> 01:31:29.620]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:29.940]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:34.305]  InfoWars.com InfoWars InfoWars Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[01:31:34.466 --> 01:31:36.308]  InfoWars.com Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[01:31:36.468 --> 01:31:37.129]  InfoWars.com
[01:31:39.562 --> 01:31:43.225]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[01:31:43.305 --> 01:31:46.428]  InfoWars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[01:31:46.668 --> 01:31:47.889]  Alex Jones, nice guy.
[01:31:48.009 --> 01:31:49.510]  InfoWars.com!
[01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:50.371]  InfoWars.
[01:31:50.591 --> 01:31:51.292]  InfoWars.
[01:31:51.432 --> 01:31:52.032]  InfoWars.
[01:31:52.093 --> 01:31:52.733]  InfoWars.
[01:31:52.793 --> 01:31:54.394]  What's happened with InfoWars?
[01:31:54.555 --> 01:31:57.977]  I would love it if you would follow up also about Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[01:31:58.118 --> 01:32:02.141]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[01:32:02.261 --> 01:32:03.782]  You didn't call me to testify in America.
[01:32:03.882 --> 01:32:05.322]  I have a right to face my accusers.
[01:32:05.723 --> 01:32:08.064]  And you, Congressman Deutch, are a liar and a fraud.
[01:32:08.184 --> 01:32:13.106]  I know we had Alex Jones in the room earlier, promoting conspiracy theories.
[01:32:13.266 --> 01:32:18.429]  InfoWars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[01:32:18.529 --> 01:32:22.170]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment.
[01:32:22.251 --> 01:32:25.192]  InfoWars just lost their war on info.
[01:32:25.312 --> 01:32:29.294]  Yesterday, Apple, iTunes, Vimeo, and Spotify, YouTube, Twitter,
[01:32:29.554 --> 01:32:32.695]  Facebook have all blocked Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[01:32:32.755 --> 01:32:36.036]  Who is the most banned news network in the world?
[01:32:36.096 --> 01:32:37.156]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[01:32:37.296 --> 01:32:39.897]  Alex Jones has now been taken off Facebook, thank God.
[01:32:39.937 --> 01:32:42.558]  CNN waged a long campaign against Jones.
[01:32:42.678 --> 01:32:43.218]  It worked.
[01:32:43.739 --> 01:32:46.399]  Jeff Zucker silenced and de-platformed his show.
[01:32:46.419 --> 01:32:49.120]  It was a stunning defeat for free speech.
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:54.182]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:33:05.894 --> 01:33:08.618]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:09.199 --> 01:33:10.861]  Oh Alex, we've got a plan.
[01:33:10.881 --> 01:33:12.343]  You'll get less heat if you bow down.
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:33.861]  Alright, let's rampage through your calls.
[01:33:35.582 --> 01:33:37.584]  Right through to the fourth hour.
[01:33:38.965 --> 01:33:47.531]  I just took one caller, and I don't mean to be so mean to him, but people tell me... People walk to me, like, at restaurants, or at the grocery store, or at the shopping mall, or when I hike it back to where they go.
[01:33:47.551 --> 01:33:50.513]  You know, if you were a little less extreme, maybe you wouldn't have got banned.
[01:33:51.813 --> 01:33:53.575]  Or hey... You know...
[01:33:54.764 --> 01:33:57.065]  If you kind of work with the system, maybe you get left alone.
[01:33:57.125 --> 01:33:59.547]  I'm trying to overturn the corrupt, loveless system.
[01:34:00.147 --> 01:34:05.050]  I'm not trying to earn scouting merits from the pedophile New World Order.
[01:34:05.931 --> 01:34:09.433]  And these listeners, not many of them, but a certain percentage,
[01:34:10.936 --> 01:34:16.481]  They call in so you can see and hear what I'm seeing and hearing on the street, like, huh, how you like getting banned?
[01:34:16.521 --> 01:34:17.742]  How you like all the attacks?
[01:34:18.162 --> 01:34:19.603]  How you like having your kids taken away?
[01:34:19.623 --> 01:34:26.469]  I'm like, my kids weren't taken away, but that shows how sick you are, that you think that's a good thing for my political actions.
[01:34:27.710 --> 01:34:37.918]  And they're like, well, if you left the system alone, maybe you'd... These are followers, and they can't get out of that idea that if you grovel, you'll be okay.
[01:34:38.339 --> 01:34:39.600]  How are you a revolutionary?
[01:34:40.805 --> 01:34:42.388]  If you're not willing to put skin in the game.
[01:34:43.871 --> 01:34:46.315]  And again, I've given this analogy probably a thousand times.
[01:34:46.776 --> 01:34:47.878]  So I've been on there 25 years.
[01:34:51.985 --> 01:34:53.407]  But I'm going to give it again.
[01:34:54.281 --> 01:34:58.262]  They didn't have radar till the end of World War II, and it wasn't deployed in Europe.
[01:34:58.582 --> 01:35:06.944]  And so when the B-17s and the Liberators, the Lancasters, and all the bombers were going into Europe, and sometimes half the mission would be shot down.
[01:35:07.344 --> 01:35:10.265]  That means 20 planes go in, or sometimes 1,000 planes.
[01:35:11.225 --> 01:35:11.925]  500 get blown up.
[01:35:12.606 --> 01:35:13.606]  500 crews die.
[01:35:14.046 --> 01:35:17.607]  You take off, and some of those missions, 50% of you are going to die.
[01:35:17.627 --> 01:35:18.067]  Usually it's about 10%.
[01:35:18.407 --> 01:35:21.508]  So we had air superiority about late 1944.
[01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:25.090]  That's a stressful job.
[01:35:26.112 --> 01:35:27.454]  And what were those boys told to do?
[01:35:29.476 --> 01:35:30.177]  You've got a map.
[01:35:30.318 --> 01:35:31.139]  You're following the leader.
[01:35:31.199 --> 01:35:32.200]  They've got their compasses.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:32.981]  They're measuring.
[01:35:33.842 --> 01:35:36.746]  You've got landmarks you're looking for, but if it's cloudy, look for flat clouds.
[01:35:37.307 --> 01:35:38.289]  And so you see up ahead...
[01:35:39.935 --> 01:35:49.821]  Artillery firing shrapnel into the air, and you fly into the shrapnel, which blows out your engines, it comes through the window, your co-pilots, 700 miles an hour of the shrapnel, they're dead.
[01:35:52.682 --> 01:35:54.824]  That's our job, is to steer into the flat.
[01:35:55.484 --> 01:35:58.886]  And if they can literally steer into flack, I can steer into the political flack.
[01:35:59.566 --> 01:36:02.487]  My job's a thousand times easier than my grandfather's.
[01:36:02.567 --> 01:36:03.047]  Both of them.
[01:36:03.347 --> 01:36:05.869]  This is not... It's not like I'm even doing anything!
[01:36:06.029 --> 01:36:14.772]  We have a bunch of America-hating traitors that say America sucks and families suck, that want to kill born babies, and I can't take being sued or lied about?
[01:36:15.493 --> 01:36:17.494]  I'm looking for the frickin' flack, man!
[01:36:18.334 --> 01:36:20.098]  Don't call up and tell me how to avoid it!
[01:36:20.419 --> 01:36:22.344]  It's the only damn radar I've got!
[01:36:22.985 --> 01:36:27.756]  I'm flying down the nozzle of that frickin' gun, cause I'm gonna take out who's on the other end of it!
[01:36:28.643 --> 01:36:29.963]  People go, this is like professional wrestling.
[01:36:30.464 --> 01:36:37.146]  Professional wrestling is a facsimile of the tribal leader getting up and saying, the enemy's fires are two miles to the north.
[01:36:38.046 --> 01:36:39.267]  They outnumber us two to one.
[01:36:39.287 --> 01:36:41.567]  They're coming to kill us and take our wives tomorrow.
[01:36:41.867 --> 01:36:48.590]  We must attack tonight under cover of darkness and kill them with everything we've got or we will be destroyed.
[01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:51.631]  Now, get your weapons and prepare to kill!
[01:36:52.731 --> 01:36:53.372]  What do you think?
[01:36:53.412 --> 01:36:54.893]  That's not professional wrestling.
[01:36:55.053 --> 01:36:56.594]  That's what all our ancestors did.
[01:36:56.634 --> 01:36:57.314]  We survived.
[01:36:57.734 --> 01:36:59.836]  They said, get ready to kill!
[01:37:01.037 --> 01:37:07.841]  Now, we don't have to physically kill now, but we have to kill ideas and have to stop being afraid of being demonized.
[01:37:09.562 --> 01:37:11.804]  So, I'm not imitating wrestling.
[01:37:12.304 --> 01:37:19.449]  Wrestling imitates the ancient archetypes of rallying the people to war and to the wild delight
[01:37:20.922 --> 01:37:28.950]  Instead of giving in to fear, embrace the power that God gave you and stand for your family now and defeat the globalists.
[01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:31.512]  Stop trying to conform to them.
[01:37:32.133 --> 01:37:34.395]  Bending to their will has brought us to their point.
[01:37:34.916 --> 01:37:38.579]  Every time I got tricked by them, oh, we're just sad and sweet.
[01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:40.881]  Apologize for what you did.
[01:37:40.901 --> 01:37:42.583]  Okay, I apologize.
[01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:43.264]  They attacked that.
[01:37:45.538 --> 01:37:46.498]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:37:47.619 --> 01:37:48.879]  So I'll hit the vaccine news.
[01:37:48.939 --> 01:37:49.699]  It's the biggest ever.
[01:37:49.739 --> 01:37:51.220]  At 6.30 next hour, I'm behind here.
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:53.921]  I'm gonna go to your calls right now.
[01:37:55.141 --> 01:37:58.642]  But I can feel the spirit of America and the world awakening, and it feels good.
[01:37:58.682 --> 01:37:59.402]  Can't you feel it?
[01:37:59.963 --> 01:38:05.124]  The enemy can feel their squealing in pain, putting on their confidence acts, but it's never gonna work.
[01:38:11.206 --> 01:38:12.707]  Zach in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:38:12.767 --> 01:38:13.067]  Go ahead.
[01:38:14.969 --> 01:38:16.930]  A long-time listener, first-time caller.
[01:38:17.611 --> 01:38:19.232]  Love your products, love what you're doing.
[01:38:19.552 --> 01:38:20.032]  Love you, brother.
[01:38:20.072 --> 01:38:20.613]  Don't worry.
[01:38:21.093 --> 01:38:23.395]  I will never tell you to quit doing what you're doing.
[01:38:24.535 --> 01:38:26.277]  When you're going through hell, keep on going.
[01:38:27.417 --> 01:38:28.138]  Absolutely, brother.
[01:38:28.158 --> 01:38:30.820]  What's on your mind about the Mueller Report?
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:33.942]  Basically, we've got no collusion.
[01:38:34.022 --> 01:38:38.185]  Despite multiple attempts to entice people to collude, no collusion.
[01:38:38.825 --> 01:38:40.506]  Yet the liberals continue on.
[01:38:40.626 --> 01:38:42.708]  Double down and keep on going.
[01:38:43.951 --> 01:38:46.513]  My question is, when do we stand up and say enough?
[01:38:47.434 --> 01:38:48.455]  I've raised six kids.
[01:38:49.295 --> 01:38:50.956]  My grandfather told me something when I was young.
[01:38:50.976 --> 01:38:53.578]  He said, what you allow will continue.
[01:38:54.579 --> 01:39:01.945]  And every time you get a smollett, every time you get a Clinton that gets away with breaking the law with no repercussions,
[01:39:02.654 --> 01:39:07.256]  Not only does it embolden the left, it kind of demoralizes the right.
[01:39:07.456 --> 01:39:10.797]  And I just, I mean, I'm to the point where I'm just like, enough.
[01:39:11.017 --> 01:39:12.437]  You know, when is enough enough?
[01:39:12.938 --> 01:39:19.360]  When do we say no more and people start facing consequences for their idiot actions?
[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:21.681]  No, I totally agree with you.
[01:39:22.021 --> 01:39:27.783]  And the good news is the arrogance of them letting Smollett off and all that's only woken more people up.
[01:39:29.261 --> 01:39:33.462]  In fact, if the Democrats rip their eyeballs with the Russians and the Chinese, they blame us for that.
[01:39:33.482 --> 01:39:34.843]  I mean, I agree.
[01:39:34.923 --> 01:39:35.883]  Trump has to move.
[01:39:35.903 --> 01:39:37.143]  The Justice Department has to move.
[01:39:37.644 --> 01:39:38.624]  Grand juries have to move.
[01:39:38.644 --> 01:39:42.685]  This is not an inner-party fight or two parties fighting.
[01:39:42.985 --> 01:39:45.786]  This is criminal activity.
[01:39:46.266 --> 01:39:54.849]  I mean, this is crazy maniacs with a hard-on to destroy the country, CHICOM-funded, and Hollywood totally delusional, and it's just got to be dealt with.
[01:39:54.889 --> 01:39:55.809]  What do you think should be done?
[01:39:57.208 --> 01:40:04.216]  Um, I've supervised crews of men who've been in prison, in construction fields.
[01:40:04.677 --> 01:40:07.060]  I've run a garage full of mechanics, same story.
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:16.831]  And like I said, I mean, if you get a problem, if you've got a couple of employees giving you a problem, they're not doing their job, they're not showing up on time, you make an example of them.
[01:40:17.774 --> 01:40:27.042]  You know, you don't, I mean, nothing bad, nothing violent, but you show the rest of the employees there will be repercussions if you do not do what needs to be done.
[01:40:27.062 --> 01:40:27.582]  Exactly!
[01:40:27.763 --> 01:40:31.586]  I mean, we're not saying a lot of top Democrats' airplanes need to go down this week.
[01:40:32.306 --> 01:40:35.929]  All we're saying is they need to be indicted, they need to be audited.
[01:40:36.049 --> 01:40:38.091]  They're the ones on TV saying, audit all the conservatives.
[01:40:38.772 --> 01:40:39.693]  These Democrats, like,
[01:40:40.418 --> 01:40:41.058]  No, it does not.
[01:40:41.078 --> 01:40:41.238]  And, um...
[01:41:09.546 --> 01:41:11.227]  I mean, it's just, it's maddening, you know.
[01:41:11.347 --> 01:41:15.549]  I mean, even here locally, there's been some liberal politicians.
[01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:20.671]  I mean, we had a prosecutor south of here that beat his girlfriend.
[01:41:21.311 --> 01:41:22.611]  Was there any repercussions for it?
[01:41:22.671 --> 01:41:24.332]  No, he's just not a prosecutor no more.
[01:41:24.372 --> 01:41:26.613]  He got a slap on the wrist with the community service.
[01:41:27.273 --> 01:41:30.435]  Or if it was me or you, we'd be doing years in jail.
[01:41:31.895 --> 01:41:36.257]  You know, actually confessed to criminal confinement.
[01:41:38.234 --> 01:41:40.476]  And it just makes you want to throw your hands up in the air.
[01:41:40.516 --> 01:41:43.058]  There's two different kinds of legal systems in this country.
[01:41:43.518 --> 01:41:50.683]  There's the, you know, the left that gets away with everything, and me, just a hard-working guy trying to take care of his family.
[01:41:50.703 --> 01:41:57.808]  If I, you know, if I have one too many drinks and decide to go do something stupid, which I don't, and go drive a car... No, that's right.
[01:41:57.848 --> 01:42:00.210]  Good people have the book thrown at them, and folks see through that.
[01:42:00.250 --> 01:42:00.971]  Zach, God bless you.
[01:42:01.718 --> 01:42:03.359]  I'm thinking like one call per segment now.
[01:42:03.379 --> 01:42:04.260]  These calls are so good.
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:05.761]  When we come back, I'm going to put three in.
[01:42:06.402 --> 01:42:09.224]  We're going to go to Bear in Wisconsin.
[01:42:09.965 --> 01:42:10.445]  Or Washington.
[01:42:10.465 --> 01:42:11.266]  I keep saying that wrong.
[01:42:11.826 --> 01:42:13.828]  My eyes aren't as good as they were even three or four years ago.
[01:42:13.868 --> 01:42:16.610]  We got to move that computer screen closer than 20 feet.
[01:42:17.011 --> 01:42:17.911]  I can't read that anymore.
[01:42:18.652 --> 01:42:19.893]  My eyes are starting to go, folks.
[01:42:19.953 --> 01:42:20.514]  I'm getting older.
[01:42:20.534 --> 01:42:20.514]  45.
[01:42:21.795 --> 01:42:26.198]  And then we got David and Mark and Brian and Jonathan and Gary and Jacob and everybody else.
[01:42:26.979 --> 01:42:27.620]  Please don't forget.
[01:42:28.692 --> 01:42:30.213]  I hate plugging, but the products are great.
[01:42:30.493 --> 01:42:32.715]  But I barely plug because I don't want to plug when I cover news.
[01:42:33.516 --> 01:42:34.576]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:42:35.317 --> 01:42:39.340]  We have 50% off all ball caps, all t-shirts, all apparel.
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:41.602]  A lot of great stuff there to spread the word.
[01:42:41.642 --> 01:42:42.723]  Please get a t-shirt today.
[01:42:42.743 --> 01:42:47.626]  Get an air filtration or water filtration or two weeks supply of thermal food.
[01:42:48.026 --> 01:42:48.927]  Just have as a backup.
[01:42:48.987 --> 01:42:49.548]  It's amazing.
[01:42:49.848 --> 01:42:50.829]  Some of the biggest deals ever.
[01:42:50.989 --> 01:42:54.852]  A DNA Force Plus discount at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:42:54.892 --> 01:42:55.472]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:12.415 --> 01:43:22.779]  Now, normally, when I drink Turbo Force, I usually like to drink it before the war room and I get a kick and then it sustains me through the rest of the night.
[01:43:22.879 --> 01:43:24.080]  I get to work out in it and everything.
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:28.502]  And I usually just pound it down and chase it with some Brain Force Plus.
[01:43:28.582 --> 01:43:36.985]  But Will Johnson, who's hosting the fourth hour, has made a suggestion before to me, and that is to drink it with hot water like you would sip on tea.
[01:43:37.305 --> 01:43:40.347]  So that's actually what I'm going to do today.
[01:43:41.187 --> 01:43:42.088]  On the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:42.108 --> 01:43:49.932]  So let me just empty my packet of TurboForce into my InfoWars tumbler, which you can also get at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:50.312 --> 01:43:51.512]  Go ahead and knock that out.
[01:43:51.593 --> 01:43:52.413]  Go ahead and stir that in.
[01:43:52.453 --> 01:43:54.034]  I've got pretty hot water here.
[01:43:54.074 --> 01:43:58.136]  It's been sitting for a minute, so I should be able to drink this without it having to wait too long.
[01:43:58.336 --> 01:43:59.777]  I kind of feel like I'm doing an infomercial.
[01:43:59.917 --> 01:44:03.700]  Me stirring a cup of turbo force has never looked so good.
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:07.282]  Oh my gosh, we're about to sell out of turbo force with this one, folks.
[01:44:07.322 --> 01:44:09.464]  So, you better go to Infowarsstore.com immediately.
[01:44:09.484 --> 01:44:10.344]  Alright, you think I got it?
[01:44:10.404 --> 01:44:12.886]  Look at the turbo force spinning so eloquently.
[01:44:13.066 --> 01:44:14.147]  Nothing to disturb it.
[01:44:14.227 --> 01:44:16.949]  Just pure energy waiting for me to consume it.
[01:44:17.149 --> 01:44:17.449]  Yes.
[01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.070]  Ah.
[01:44:18.850 --> 01:44:27.921]  I'm thinking of my turbo force, and how great it's gonna make me feel, and the pure energy that I'm gonna get from my turbo force.
[01:44:28.022 --> 01:44:29.844]  Heading for WarStore.com.
[01:44:30.885 --> 01:44:33.268]  Yes, total equilibrium.
[01:44:35.248 --> 01:44:36.548]  Find your chi.
[01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:40.710]  Find the energy with TurboForce at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:44.911]  I'm getting ready for a long four-hour broadcast and I need my energy.
[01:44:44.931 --> 01:44:53.634]  I'm sipping TurboForce mixed with hot water and I find my chi as I host the Alex Jones Show.
[01:44:54.594 --> 01:44:55.295]  It's magic.
[01:44:56.275 --> 01:44:59.336]  It's TurboForce from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:45:03.228 --> 01:45:06.271]  Now to a dire warning about climate change.
[01:45:07.732 --> 01:45:08.633]  A dire warning.
[01:45:08.653 --> 01:45:09.333]  A dire warning.
[01:45:09.353 --> 01:45:10.174]  A dire warning.
[01:45:10.194 --> 01:45:11.035]  A dire new warning.
[01:45:11.055 --> 01:45:11.856]  A dire warning.
[01:45:11.956 --> 01:45:12.957]  Another dire warning.
[01:45:12.977 --> 01:45:14.338]  The situation is dire.
[01:45:14.818 --> 01:45:15.699]  A dire warning.
[01:45:15.719 --> 01:45:16.920]  Dire consequences.
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:18.041]  A dire warning.
[01:45:18.081 --> 01:45:18.982]  It sounds dire.
[01:45:19.042 --> 01:45:20.403]  What prompted this warning?
[01:45:20.463 --> 01:45:22.325]  We have a global emergency.
[01:45:23.832 --> 01:45:28.113]  It's here, it's man-made, and there are going to be dire results.
[01:45:28.173 --> 01:45:34.254]  The government issued its most dramatic report yet about climate change today, and it came with a dire warning.
[01:45:34.334 --> 01:45:35.354]  A stark warning.
[01:45:35.454 --> 01:45:37.414]  A warning to humanity.
[01:45:37.434 --> 01:45:41.275]  An existential threat to human civilization on this planet.
[01:45:41.415 --> 01:45:45.236]  Experts say that we have until 2030 to avoid catastrophe.
[01:45:45.376 --> 01:45:51.317]  And we, the scientists also tell us, have 12 years in which to answer that question.
[01:45:51.337 --> 01:45:53.397]  12 years within which to act.
[01:45:55.327 --> 01:45:58.689]  The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[01:45:58.829 --> 01:46:01.150]  We have 12 years to turn this around.
[01:46:01.170 --> 01:46:04.332]  By the year 2030, that's just 12 years from now.
[01:46:04.412 --> 01:46:07.514]  The future is closer than we think and is not good.
[01:46:07.654 --> 01:46:10.036]  There will be irreversible damage to the planet.
[01:46:11.076 --> 01:46:15.378]  ...is running out to prevent global warming from reaching a catastrophic milestone.
[01:46:15.418 --> 01:46:16.639]  Sea levels rising.
[01:46:16.679 --> 01:46:17.359]  Extreme drought.
[01:46:17.379 --> 01:46:18.360]  Severe storms.
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:21.021]  Widespread fires and extreme flooding.
[01:46:21.121 --> 01:46:22.341]  Dangerous heatwaves.
[01:46:22.461 --> 01:46:25.583]  Rising sea levels and forcing millions from their homes.
[01:46:25.763 --> 01:46:28.204]  Crop failure and mass population movement.
[01:46:28.224 --> 01:46:29.325]  As well as food shortages.
[01:46:29.405 --> 01:46:32.206]  Millions around the world face future disaster.
[01:46:32.386 --> 01:46:32.986]  Pretty serious.
[01:46:33.046 --> 01:46:34.107]  People are dying.
[01:46:34.147 --> 01:46:37.789]  President Trump has frequently doubted its existence and has called it a hoax.
[01:46:37.929 --> 01:46:38.549]  I don't believe it.
[01:46:40.606 --> 01:46:42.347]  The world is gonna end in 12 years.
[01:46:43.568 --> 01:46:51.375]  From the creators of the Russian Collusion Conspiracy and the Jussie Smollett hate crime, this summer, be afraid.
[01:46:51.755 --> 01:46:53.756]  Be very afraid.
[01:46:53.997 --> 01:46:55.698]  Like, this is the war.
[01:46:55.718 --> 01:46:57.019]  This is our World War II.
[01:46:57.199 --> 01:46:59.020]  Countdown to Apocalypse 2030.
[01:46:59.421 --> 01:47:02.543]  We're all gonna die.
[01:47:06.907 --> 01:47:09.569]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:25.757 --> 01:47:29.599]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:47:30.099 --> 01:47:34.041]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:41.785 --> 01:47:43.226]  Riders on the storm.
[01:47:44.046 --> 01:47:46.087]  Riders on the storm.
[01:47:46.387 --> 01:47:48.308]  To this world we're born.
[01:47:48.669 --> 01:47:50.109]  Riders on the storm.
[01:47:50.129 --> 01:47:51.090]  To this world we're thrown.
[01:47:58.384 --> 01:48:02.385]  Into this house your family names your house.
[01:48:02.405 --> 01:48:06.567]  Then into this world.
[01:48:06.687 --> 01:48:07.728]  First you enter the house.
[01:48:08.288 --> 01:48:09.789]  Then you enter the world.
[01:48:10.909 --> 01:48:11.970]  I'm with House Jones.
[01:48:13.691 --> 01:48:14.631]  Proud of the old name.
[01:48:15.171 --> 01:48:16.132]  Means steadfastness.
[01:48:16.172 --> 01:48:17.832]  Take a long holiday.
[01:48:23.707 --> 01:48:25.028]  Let your children play.
[01:48:28.110 --> 01:48:29.691]  If you give this man a ride.
[01:48:30.671 --> 01:48:35.134]  Good stuff.
[01:48:35.895 --> 01:48:42.078]  Alright, I'm going to stop screwing around.
[01:48:42.158 --> 01:48:43.119]  Each caller gets a minute and a half.
[01:48:43.139 --> 01:48:44.400]  I'm going to barely comment.
[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:45.000]  Move to the next person.
[01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:46.081]  We've got 20-something callers.
[01:48:47.062 --> 01:48:48.262]  Who is up next here?
[01:48:48.963 --> 01:48:50.784]  Let's talk to Mark in Colorado.
[01:48:50.844 --> 01:48:52.085]  Mark, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:48:52.105 --> 01:48:52.385]  Go ahead.
[01:48:53.183 --> 01:48:53.383]  Yeah.
[01:48:54.804 --> 01:48:56.345]  Seems like y'all, thank you.
[01:48:56.785 --> 01:48:58.406]  Seems like you have all the frames out to get you.
[01:48:58.446 --> 01:48:59.767]  Maybe you're in their crosshairs.
[01:49:00.288 --> 01:49:02.569]  But anyhow, really quick.
[01:49:03.610 --> 01:49:04.951]  I just want to touch on that Mueller report.
[01:49:05.011 --> 01:49:10.334]  I don't see it there as a coincidence that Julian Assange was arrested right after the report dropped.
[01:49:10.994 --> 01:49:16.478]  I think they're going to all tie it all together to get, you know, cases going against all the people that should be indicted.
[01:49:17.324 --> 01:49:20.306]  And no, I don't think that they should pardon Julian Assange yet.
[01:49:20.527 --> 01:49:24.090]  We need to get him to spill the beans and give him immunity and then he can live free here, you know?
[01:49:25.130 --> 01:49:29.554]  And then I just want to touch a point really quick on Robert's stab your country in the back molar.
[01:49:29.574 --> 01:49:33.958]  Remember the Bundy incident and all that such that was happening out there?
[01:49:33.978 --> 01:49:38.101]  Well, that happened to be part of some mines west of there that were part of that uranium one deal.
[01:49:39.382 --> 01:49:41.464]  So I think a lot of this is all tying together here.
[01:49:41.524 --> 01:49:43.525]  It's going to come together in one big point, but
[01:49:45.854 --> 01:49:52.076]  Well, I mean, they sue anybody that even questions Seth Rich's death, even though you have free speech to that, so what does that tell you?
[01:49:52.116 --> 01:49:53.657]  But, you're absolutely right about the big picture.
[01:50:11.550 --> 01:50:16.724]  And where all this is going because it just gets crazier and crazier and crazier.
[01:50:16.744 --> 01:50:18.368]  And when you talk about Mueller...
[01:50:19.622 --> 01:50:27.067]  And the so-called 12 people that haven't been indicted that have been referraled for indictments inside this, they plan to have this continue on.
[01:50:27.367 --> 01:50:29.888]  That's why Trump has to understand he's got to go after these people.
[01:50:30.449 --> 01:50:33.150]  They've not made a deal with him to back off and leave the country alone.
[01:50:33.190 --> 01:50:34.291]  These are chi-com agents.
[01:50:34.311 --> 01:50:35.032]  These are globalists.
[01:50:35.692 --> 01:50:38.114]  And he's got to go after them and get on the offense.
[01:50:38.414 --> 01:50:41.095]  The Democrats have signaled they're going to continue this fraud.
[01:50:41.516 --> 01:50:42.917]  Well, they're all as dirty as a...
[01:50:43.837 --> 01:50:44.398]  Latrine.
[01:50:45.018 --> 01:50:46.359]  They're as dirty as a porta potty.
[01:50:47.019 --> 01:50:48.240]  So give them what they want.
[01:50:48.601 --> 01:50:49.441]  Stop rolling over.
[01:50:49.481 --> 01:50:55.406]  They've been squatting on top of America with the mainstream media and Hollywood, pissing in everybody's faces forever.
[01:50:55.706 --> 01:50:58.768]  It's time to stop giving in to fear to the globalists.
[01:50:59.068 --> 01:51:01.470]  It's time to give them what they want, which is prison.
[01:51:02.851 --> 01:51:03.552]  Don't back down.
[01:51:03.772 --> 01:51:10.517]  I'm certainly not backing down, and I hope Trump doesn't either, because, you know, Ralph Waldo Emerson, he has a really good poem out there called The Concord Hymen at the very bottom of it.
[01:51:11.070 --> 01:51:15.213]  It states, for those out there who dare to die so our children can live free, I stand by that one.
[01:51:15.914 --> 01:51:16.234]  I hear you.
[01:51:16.294 --> 01:51:17.495]  I appreciate your call, brother.
[01:51:17.515 --> 01:51:18.756]  Appreciate your call.
[01:51:19.216 --> 01:51:21.218]  Let's go to Bear in Washington.
[01:51:22.019 --> 01:51:22.819]  Bear, you're on the air.
[01:51:22.859 --> 01:51:23.920]  What's your view on all this?
[01:51:25.121 --> 01:51:25.841]  Hey, Alex.
[01:51:26.042 --> 01:51:27.283]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:51:27.383 --> 01:51:28.263]  I'm a little nervous.
[01:51:31.066 --> 01:51:34.827]  The Patriots out here are having their equipment attacked.
[01:51:35.347 --> 01:51:36.828]  That is how they're controlling this.
[01:51:36.888 --> 01:51:41.389]  Apparently Obama signed in via the Deep State Cyber Command.
[01:51:41.769 --> 01:51:43.329]  They're attacking BIOS.
[01:51:43.649 --> 01:51:46.930]  I know of just a set of 25 Patriots.
[01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:49.951]  Out of the 25, 10 of them have lost equipment.
[01:51:50.846 --> 01:51:52.147]  I've lost channels.
[01:51:52.327 --> 01:51:53.688]  I've lost computers.
[01:51:53.709 --> 01:51:55.570]  I've had my BIOS destroyed.
[01:51:56.931 --> 01:51:59.053]  Many others have had their phones fried.
[01:51:59.073 --> 01:52:00.214]  You know, it's funny you say that.
[01:52:00.234 --> 01:52:04.958]  Remember about 12 years ago, John McCain said, if someone pirates music,
[01:52:06.027 --> 01:52:07.568]  Guys, search this on Google Web.
[01:52:07.628 --> 01:52:08.528]  Don't click News.
[01:52:08.929 --> 01:52:09.849]  That's only good for a month.
[01:52:09.909 --> 01:52:11.970]  And I know you know that for the listeners.
[01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:13.311]  Search Web.
[01:52:13.911 --> 01:52:14.571]  Or search Bing.
[01:52:14.611 --> 01:52:15.732]  It's not as bad as Google.
[01:52:16.252 --> 01:52:20.515]  Type in John McCain says, blow up computers of pirates.
[01:52:21.055 --> 01:52:27.598]  Well, he just says, if we think you downloaded music illegally, they have viruses they can send to destroy your computer.
[01:52:27.998 --> 01:52:30.100]  So that is definitely something that goes on.
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:32.321]  There's also just planned obsolescence.
[01:52:33.450 --> 01:52:36.091]  And a lot of computers are crap, so that goes on.
[01:52:36.111 --> 01:52:48.495]  But yeah, in this age of censorship, you know, we had them six months ago have a big computer company break into our servers for one minute and then report on the national news that we've been compromised, which we hadn't been.
[01:52:48.955 --> 01:52:50.916]  So I'm definitely aware of that type of stuff, Bear.
[01:52:50.936 --> 01:52:51.696]  I appreciate your call.
[01:52:52.377 --> 01:52:53.697]  And that Obama stay behind network.
[01:52:53.717 --> 01:52:54.758]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[01:52:54.778 --> 01:52:55.738]  They're in cyber command.
[01:52:55.758 --> 01:52:56.438]  They're in all of it.
[01:52:57.478 --> 01:52:58.499]  Front needs to take action.
[01:53:00.422 --> 01:53:02.984]  Jimmy, in the great state of Maine.
[01:53:03.044 --> 01:53:03.824]  Jimmy, you're on the air.
[01:53:03.884 --> 01:53:04.184]  Welcome.
[01:53:05.585 --> 01:53:06.526]  What's going on, Alex, man?
[01:53:06.566 --> 01:53:07.427]  You're doing a good job.
[01:53:07.447 --> 01:53:09.028]  I'm trying.
[01:53:09.268 --> 01:53:10.729]  The genie's already out the bottle.
[01:53:10.789 --> 01:53:13.971]  I think we're done waiting for Trump to fucking go after him.
[01:53:14.031 --> 01:53:15.131]  The time is now.
[01:53:15.372 --> 01:53:19.434]  He's treating us and the American people like he don't appreciate what we do every day for him.
[01:53:19.714 --> 01:53:20.755]  We put it all on the line.
[01:53:20.775 --> 01:53:21.776]  You put it all on the line.
[01:53:22.056 --> 01:53:23.717]  You need to do this expeditiously.
[01:53:23.997 --> 01:53:25.138]  We've been waiting long enough.
[01:53:25.598 --> 01:53:26.419]  We need to go after them.
[01:53:26.479 --> 01:53:29.120]  Get these traitors off the streets and drain us all.
[01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:32.982]  No, I totally agree because Trump has to know the Internet's being handed over to the UN.
[01:53:33.122 --> 01:53:34.743]  They're all signing agreements to censor.
[01:53:35.564 --> 01:53:36.704]  They're screwing everybody over.
[01:53:36.724 --> 01:53:37.425]  I agree.
[01:53:37.465 --> 01:53:40.286]  He must go on the offense because it's the right thing to do.
[01:53:40.346 --> 01:53:41.207]  Plus, we're under attack.
[01:53:41.227 --> 01:53:42.167]  What do you think Trump should do?
[01:53:43.588 --> 01:53:44.088]  He hung up.
[01:53:45.329 --> 01:53:46.309]  That caller was on fire.
[01:53:46.329 --> 01:53:47.210]  I was ready to talk to him.
[01:53:47.230 --> 01:53:49.511]  Well, that's too bad.
[01:53:50.492 --> 01:53:52.213]  Brian in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:53:52.253 --> 01:53:52.533]  Go ahead.
[01:53:56.815 --> 01:53:58.916]  Right now, which is to say, Happy Easter.
[01:54:00.037 --> 01:54:03.239]  I hope you have a wonderful rest of the Holy Week with your family.
[01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:04.060]  Thank you, sir.
[01:54:05.041 --> 01:54:14.787]  I'd also like to say, you know, I own the Alexa Pure Pro, because especially during this Holy Week of Easter, I love my neighbor, but I refuse to drink their heart medication.
[01:54:15.328 --> 01:54:16.649]  Two quick things before I dig in.
[01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:17.689]  Well, explain that.
[01:54:18.110 --> 01:54:25.294]  Well water is some of the most polluted stuff in the country, because you got glyphosate, you got all your neighbor's medications that they're putting into a
[01:54:27.697 --> 01:54:30.959]  Septic tank, that then goes into the groundwater and you drink it.
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:33.581]  So absolutely, the number one thing anybody can do.
[01:54:33.881 --> 01:54:35.102]  And by the way, I forget to do this again.
[01:54:35.142 --> 01:54:39.565]  Man, when I drink filtered water, when I take the supplements, my life's so much better.
[01:54:39.906 --> 01:54:44.069]  When I forget, because I'm not Mr. Frickin' Health, I feel it.
[01:54:44.269 --> 01:54:47.291]  So yes, tell me about not wanting to drink your neighbor's heart medication.
[01:54:49.113 --> 01:55:00.284]  Well, where I live, and I think this is the same story for most of the country, our water filtration is based on a reverse osmosis system that was constructed around the turn of the century.
[01:55:00.584 --> 01:55:05.409]  And I have zero, zero faith in local reporting on the quality of the water.
[01:55:06.190 --> 01:55:08.953]  And so I do all that I can do and I purchased my own filter.
[01:55:10.855 --> 01:55:11.776]  Well, look at Flint, Michigan.
[01:55:12.932 --> 01:55:16.735]  Their water is full of lead, mercury, poisons, E. coli.
[01:55:17.056 --> 01:55:20.819]  The answer is, everyone, if you're drinking water, you should filter it.
[01:55:21.199 --> 01:55:32.009]  And then I'll never forget David Hogg, goes, you know, Alex Jones on C-SPAN, he goes, little anti-gun guy, he goes, he says the water has toxins and then he sells a water filter.
[01:55:33.115 --> 01:55:44.040]  Yeah, it's like saying, your kids need vitamin C, and then I sell vitamin C. Or, Jones says we need to wear shoes, we walk in the snow, then he advertises shoes.
[01:55:44.260 --> 01:55:45.161]  Yes, exactly!
[01:55:45.461 --> 01:55:52.304]  But see, in his little brain, where everything is a scam, he thinks I'm scamming people when it's a direct sale.
[01:55:52.845 --> 01:55:57.327]  We have the best gravity-fed systems, Alexa Pure and Pro Pure are apples and oranges, but they're both excellent.
[01:55:58.007 --> 01:55:58.827]  Everyone needs it.
[01:55:59.348 --> 01:56:00.588]  Everyone should filter their water.
[01:56:00.608 --> 01:56:02.249]  This is the smartest thing you can do.
[01:56:02.269 --> 01:56:04.369]  It doesn't mean occasionally you don't drink some ice tea at a restaurant.
[01:56:04.750 --> 01:56:06.470]  But you need to filter your water.
[01:56:06.810 --> 01:56:08.251]  Your skin is your biggest organ.
[01:56:08.531 --> 01:56:09.991]  You absorb it there.
[01:56:10.552 --> 01:56:13.393]  You need filters on your shower or your bath.
[01:56:14.093 --> 01:56:14.773]  Exactly.
[01:56:14.913 --> 01:56:16.714]  And then you look at what's in the water table.
[01:56:16.874 --> 01:56:17.954]  It's insane!
[01:56:17.974 --> 01:56:22.456]  Anything else, Brian?
[01:56:23.945 --> 01:56:26.826]  Yeah, so real quickly, I just wanted to touch on one quick thing.
[01:56:27.066 --> 01:56:35.809]  I'm calling out here from from Luzerne County in Pennsylvania, and arguably it is one of the most, I'd say, top three, depending on who you talk to, corrupt counties.
[01:56:37.169 --> 01:56:41.691]  They are currently trying to enforce and successfully doing so, enforcing a rain tax.
[01:56:43.071 --> 01:56:50.814]  It is, I think, on its way to get to President Trump, but it needs to get national attention because this is the test bed for some ridiculous stuff here.
[01:56:50.874 --> 01:56:53.535]  But in terms of the Mueller report, I think
[01:56:54.794 --> 01:57:04.961]  They go in detail, I think about 30 pages, trying to define the word otherwise in terms of one aspect of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
[01:57:05.642 --> 01:57:10.345]  And they're going to be, I mean, just like you say, you take flak when you're over the target.
[01:57:10.685 --> 01:57:18.211]  They're zeroed in on a single word and trying to define how they can pull obstruction out of that.
[01:57:18.331 --> 01:57:21.313]  Oh yeah, they're going for obstruction of a crime that didn't exist.
[01:57:22.381 --> 01:57:25.303]  They're going to crank it up to 11 for the foreseeable future.
[01:57:25.843 --> 01:57:27.184]  Don't hang up, Ryan.
[01:57:28.164 --> 01:57:28.945]  You're a smart caller.
[01:57:28.965 --> 01:57:31.046]  I'm going to come back and give you the floor for five minutes.
[01:57:31.606 --> 01:57:33.947]  And then we're going to go to Gary.
[01:57:34.448 --> 01:57:35.108]  We're going to go to Jimmy.
[01:57:35.648 --> 01:57:36.349]  We're going to go to Jacob.
[01:57:36.369 --> 01:57:37.209]  We're going to go to everybody.
[01:57:37.709 --> 01:57:38.550]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.890]  Hour number three.
[01:57:40.671 --> 01:57:42.412]  And yes, I will get into the vaccine news.
[01:57:42.492 --> 01:57:43.853]  It's so paramount, I promise.
[01:57:44.493 --> 01:57:45.273]  And so much more.
[01:57:46.014 --> 01:57:49.856]  By the way, the modern architect of Notre Dame says it looks like ours.
[01:57:52.952 --> 01:57:56.353]  You're sitting there, you gather up the flame and say, I got a good idea.
[01:57:57.374 --> 01:58:03.036]  Let's gather up everything we have, sell it, give it to some coyotes and take us to a country that doesn't want us.
[01:58:03.836 --> 01:58:05.637]  Drop us off in God knows where.
[01:58:06.797 --> 01:58:10.018]  We don't know anybody, we're going to leave everything that's familiar to us.
[01:58:10.218 --> 01:58:10.759]  Let's go.
[01:58:10.779 --> 01:58:12.719]  Isn't that going to be a great idea?
[01:58:15.580 --> 01:58:20.042]  These are horrible decisions these people are making to decide to come here.
[01:58:22.328 --> 01:58:33.378]  I don't know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guest workers who will work for lower wages than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are right now.
[01:58:33.939 --> 01:58:37.202]  Illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple.
[01:58:38.223 --> 01:58:45.590]  Until the American people are convinced that we will stop future flows of illegal immigration, we will make no progress.
[01:58:46.641 --> 01:59:00.008]  Well, look, I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in.
[01:59:01.409 --> 01:59:03.970]  And I do think you have to control your borders.
[01:59:04.330 --> 01:59:07.552]  The bill before us will certainly do some good.
[01:59:08.772 --> 01:59:09.813]  We're good to go.
[01:59:22.543 --> 01:59:31.507]  Not only in the states most heavily affected, but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country.
[01:59:31.827 --> 01:59:37.590]  The day when America could be the welfare system for Mexico is gone.
[01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:39.571]  We simply can't afford it.
[01:59:39.951 --> 01:59:43.033]  The people who should be here are those who come legally at this time.
[01:59:43.933 --> 01:59:47.595]  And we've got to, for the time being, enforce our borders.
[01:59:56.489 --> 02:00:00.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:14.898 --> 02:00:19.861]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.242 --> 02:00:28.446]  I do have the right to fight back, and I'm fighting back not for me, I'm fighting back for the people of this country.
[02:00:28.526 --> 02:00:29.347]  No collusion!
[02:00:29.447 --> 02:00:30.588]  There is no collusion.
[02:00:30.768 --> 02:00:31.568]  No collusion!
[02:00:31.968 --> 02:00:32.609]  No collusion.
[02:00:32.949 --> 02:00:34.730]  There is absolutely no collusion.
[02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:35.671]  There's no collusion.
[02:00:35.811 --> 02:00:37.312]  The fact is there is no collusion.
[02:00:37.352 --> 02:00:38.132]  No collusion!
[02:00:38.332 --> 02:00:39.253]  There's no collusion.
[02:00:39.793 --> 02:00:46.295]  This is a investigation where many many millions of dollars has been spent and there's no collusion.
[02:00:46.595 --> 02:00:54.157]  This is a win for this president who for now two years has essentially been screaming there was no Russia collusion.
[02:00:54.397 --> 02:00:57.798]  He is backed up by Mueller.
[02:00:58.198 --> 02:01:05.340]  Maybe every time he said no collusion, like more than 231 times so far, maybe every time he said no collusion he was telling the truth.
[02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:10.122]  This was an illegal takedown that failed.
[02:01:11.203 --> 02:01:13.684]  And hopefully somebody's gonna look at the other side.
[02:01:14.985 --> 02:01:24.630]  Hey, you know, Alex, they might go easy on you if you back down.
[02:01:24.691 --> 02:01:27.352]  They're gonna hurt you if you don't.
[02:01:30.834 --> 02:01:32.215]  That's the funniest thing, man.
[02:01:32.475 --> 02:01:34.056]  That happens on the street all the time.
[02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:37.843]  It's always some guy that's got a Porsche and some trophy wife or something.
[02:01:37.863 --> 02:01:39.404]  They think they're powerful because they sold out.
[02:01:40.345 --> 02:01:42.908]  We walk over in the country, people like me, Bill.
[02:01:43.709 --> 02:01:45.591]  And they tell me, how's it going?
[02:01:45.631 --> 02:01:47.312]  Boy, you're getting really beat up right now.
[02:01:47.412 --> 02:01:48.914]  You know, you might want to play ball.
[02:01:52.497 --> 02:01:54.079]  It's hilarious!
[02:01:54.780 --> 02:01:56.602]  I'm not here to play ball, dumbass.
[02:01:57.881 --> 02:02:00.983]  I'm here to overturn your system and restore the Republic.
[02:02:01.643 --> 02:02:02.503]  So get ready for it.
[02:02:02.563 --> 02:02:03.524]  That's why they don't get it.
[02:02:03.864 --> 02:02:06.686]  I get killed, I get in prison, I win, as long as I'm right with God.
[02:02:08.106 --> 02:02:09.847]  And I'll do whatever it takes.
[02:02:10.888 --> 02:02:13.209]  But I do want to fight as hard as I can, as long as I can.
[02:02:13.229 --> 02:02:14.470]  That's why I need your prayers, folks.
[02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:17.991]  A lot of great callers here right now.
[02:02:18.011 --> 02:02:19.812]  You can feel the spirit of liberty rising right now.
[02:02:20.893 --> 02:02:21.413]  I can feel it.
[02:02:21.433 --> 02:02:21.893]  Can't you?
[02:02:22.033 --> 02:02:22.874]  That's what really matters.
[02:02:25.825 --> 02:02:27.506]  Brian in Pennsylvania, you're making some great points.
[02:02:27.526 --> 02:02:28.247]  You've got three minutes.
[02:02:28.707 --> 02:02:29.667]  Make those points, my friend.
[02:02:31.188 --> 02:02:31.629]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:31.789 --> 02:02:34.290]  Well, I'd like to just throw a theory out there.
[02:02:35.251 --> 02:02:46.618]  So personally, I come from a long bloodline of Ulster Scots, basically from northern Scotland, you know, the Highlands, Isle of Skye, and Ulster, Northern Ireland.
[02:02:47.098 --> 02:02:48.219]  And my family's been here.
[02:02:48.239 --> 02:02:50.781]  So that translates to absolute badasses.
[02:02:52.625 --> 02:02:55.966]  Yeah, and it sometimes works against me, as I'm sure you know.
[02:02:58.507 --> 02:03:02.948]  The 1600s, one of which was, I think, a judge during the Salem Witch Trials.
[02:03:03.768 --> 02:03:07.930]  And people like us, there's not many left.
[02:03:09.450 --> 02:03:16.252]  The ones that are left are basically, you know, that strength, that ancestral call is kind of diluted.
[02:03:17.033 --> 02:03:21.494]  And what I've noticed is the wool being pulled over our eyes,
[02:03:22.705 --> 02:03:23.526]  Well, let's just say it.
[02:03:23.566 --> 02:03:24.606]  We're not wolves, we're sheepdogs.
[02:03:24.686 --> 02:03:30.871]  And when you look at the general public, a bunch of sheep bought into their own destruction, it's very frustrating.
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:46.541]  Exactly, that's a great way to put it.
[02:03:46.781 --> 02:03:53.484]  I mean, I walk through day-to-day with that ancestral knowledge that, I mean, not that I can tell right from wrong.
[02:03:53.504 --> 02:03:55.145]  No, I know, but you're dialed in.
[02:03:55.165 --> 02:03:56.986]  You can feel it, yeah.
[02:03:57.006 --> 02:03:57.606]  You can feel it.
[02:03:57.626 --> 02:03:59.587]  It's not just you, it's a bunch of people, yeah.
[02:04:00.543 --> 02:04:08.525]  Yeah, talking with my grandfather who, you know, he's seen a lot of things, you know, 53 year, you know, Mason and so on and so forth.
[02:04:08.905 --> 02:04:13.567]  You know, he could tell and it's just, it's one of those things that you either have it or you don't.
[02:04:13.647 --> 02:04:17.808]  And unfortunately, you can't really reject that.
[02:04:18.988 --> 02:04:19.408]  Exactly.
[02:04:19.428 --> 02:04:20.709]  That's what Trump even said to me before.
[02:04:20.729 --> 02:04:21.849]  He goes, you either have it or you don't.
[02:04:23.288 --> 02:04:23.948]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:04:23.968 --> 02:04:24.989]  Keep fighting a good fight.
[02:04:43.772 --> 02:04:44.393]  No, that's all.
[02:04:44.673 --> 02:04:45.494]  God bless you, brother.
[02:04:46.555 --> 02:04:47.716]  You either have it or you don't.
[02:04:47.756 --> 02:04:49.958]  And these globalists don't have it.
[02:04:50.038 --> 02:04:50.859]  All they've got is the devil.
[02:04:51.399 --> 02:04:53.501]  Imagine, they don't have any connection to their ancestors.
[02:04:54.102 --> 02:04:54.682]  None of the data.
[02:04:54.722 --> 02:04:55.443]  No connection to God.
[02:04:56.024 --> 02:04:58.326]  They think we're crazy, because we know God!
[02:05:06.582 --> 02:05:11.786]  Please don't forget, we have a lot of amazing deals on the site.
[02:05:11.826 --> 02:05:13.267]  We still have store-wide free shipping.
[02:05:13.567 --> 02:05:15.829]  We had to end all those big discounts on the supplements.
[02:05:15.849 --> 02:05:21.734]  We're about to sell out of all of them, but we still have a big discount going, even though it's about to sell out on DNA Force, our flagship amazing product.

[02:06:01.407 --> 02:06:01.947]  We'll be right back.
[02:06:14.719 --> 02:06:19.303]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:06:19.663 --> 02:06:20.384]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:20.404 --> 02:06:21.785]  We're gonna do it, Jimmy.
[02:06:21.805 --> 02:06:22.926]  We're gonna do it.
[02:06:23.046 --> 02:06:25.648]  Everybody else.
[02:06:25.728 --> 02:06:29.391]  And then I promise, I'm behind on this on purpose.
[02:06:30.512 --> 02:06:35.576]  This public service announcement on vaccines is so critical and so key.
[02:06:35.596 --> 02:06:40.460]  And if people just get this one piece of info, I know we can save millions of children.
[02:06:41.721 --> 02:06:44.203]  When we talk about children, we don't talk about what color they are.
[02:06:45.503 --> 02:06:52.328]  I don't know who their mommy or daddy are, but that soul they've got in their red blood, and how they're always being hunted by the enemy.
[02:06:54.450 --> 02:06:59.134]  That's why I can't ever be a racist, even though minorities have been brainwashed against me, many of them.
[02:07:00.275 --> 02:07:05.399]  I can't look at children and hate them for who they are when they have the potential universe in them.
[02:07:07.901 --> 02:07:09.922]  But that doesn't mean I won't stand up for who I am.
[02:07:11.980 --> 02:07:18.184]  And that's why I really love Martin Luther King because I've actually read a lot of his full speeches and watched a lot of them.
[02:07:18.224 --> 02:07:19.265]  It's just common sense.
[02:07:19.285 --> 02:07:20.465]  That's why he was so popular.
[02:07:20.485 --> 02:07:25.409]  He was saying things that everybody knew and that America wanted, no matter what color you were.
[02:07:25.429 --> 02:07:30.092]  And now you tune into the modern left, it's the complete opposite of Martin Luther King.
[02:07:30.532 --> 02:07:34.014]  He said it's not what color you are, it's what you stand for and what you produce and what you do.
[02:07:34.274 --> 02:07:35.075]  Everybody knows that.
[02:07:36.331 --> 02:07:41.895]  Like, be honest with you, when there's a badass restaurant, I use this analogy 500 times, I'll do it 501 times.
[02:07:42.195 --> 02:07:55.525]  If there's a super good restaurant, whether it's soul food, or whether it's Chinese, or whether it's southern cooking, or whether it's Mexican, you don't walk in there and look and go, oh, there's a bunch of Mexicans owning this.
[02:07:56.466 --> 02:07:58.087]  I'm not gonna eat here, I don't like Mexicans.
[02:07:58.888 --> 02:08:01.450]  You go to Mexican food restaurants, it's almost all white people.
[02:08:02.471 --> 02:08:03.852]  Because the Mexican food's delicious.
[02:08:07.059 --> 02:08:07.679]  That's what I mean.
[02:08:07.759 --> 02:08:08.100]  You don't.
[02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:10.561]  You don't listen to a song like Gnarls Barkley.
[02:08:10.621 --> 02:08:11.702]  In fact, I want to go out with this.
[02:08:11.722 --> 02:08:13.283]  I'm taking a few calls, but I want to go out with Crazy.
[02:08:13.503 --> 02:08:14.224]  About two minutes of it.
[02:08:14.724 --> 02:08:16.225]  You don't think, well, that's Gnarls Barkley.
[02:08:17.566 --> 02:08:18.187]  And he's black.
[02:08:19.608 --> 02:08:20.608]  So I'm not going to listen to that.
[02:08:20.868 --> 02:08:21.929]  You hear that soul.
[02:08:22.009 --> 02:08:22.750]  That's a human.
[02:08:23.010 --> 02:08:24.231]  That's your brother right there.
[02:08:25.492 --> 02:08:26.632]  But you tune into CNN.
[02:08:27.493 --> 02:08:31.416]  All it is, is white people are out to get you.
[02:08:32.116 --> 02:08:32.777]  And you know the plan.
[02:08:32.837 --> 02:08:34.118]  It's to turn whites into racists.
[02:08:35.049 --> 02:08:38.392]  So they can then be political donors to the system.
[02:08:38.852 --> 02:08:39.713]  And we don't want that.
[02:08:40.654 --> 02:08:42.375]  We want to stop this crap right now.
[02:08:43.035 --> 02:08:47.839]  And that's why Trump's saying, you're beautiful, you're an American, you're a human, you're beautiful, we're all together.
[02:08:48.260 --> 02:08:50.041]  And they howl and say he's the enemy.
[02:08:51.022 --> 02:08:54.385]  When Trump's like the second coming of Martin Luther King.
[02:08:55.606 --> 02:08:56.927]  And his whole life's been that.
[02:08:58.668 --> 02:08:59.729]  And I'm not defending Trump.
[02:09:01.263 --> 02:09:06.725]  They had all these old racist, rich golf clubs and tennis clubs across the country.
[02:09:07.285 --> 02:09:11.187]  They were going bankrupt that were run by a hundred year old senile racist people.
[02:09:15.209 --> 02:09:18.670]  And Trump went and bought them up and then he opened them up to everybody.
[02:09:19.710 --> 02:09:23.592]  Whether you were a rich Japanese guy or a rich black guy or a rich white guy, he didn't care.
[02:09:25.916 --> 02:09:27.878]  Because he was a free market guy.
[02:09:28.439 --> 02:09:30.781]  And that's why all the rappers loved Trump.
[02:09:31.182 --> 02:09:33.785]  Why he was the coolest guy because he had all these rappers stay at his house.
[02:09:34.265 --> 02:09:35.426]  Made him breakfast himself.
[02:09:36.668 --> 02:09:37.629]  In his house, his robe.
[02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:42.074]  And then all those people like Snoop Dogg that stayed at Trump's house.
[02:09:42.134 --> 02:09:42.674]  I know he did.
[02:09:42.734 --> 02:09:43.495]  I told people that saw it.
[02:09:44.076 --> 02:09:45.638]  Piss on him and call him a racist.
[02:09:46.786 --> 02:09:53.708]  When he had you to his house and had you play at his clubs and made you money, you're a piece of crap, Snoop Dogg.
[02:09:55.449 --> 02:09:57.009]  And all those other people that make me sick.
[02:09:57.829 --> 02:09:59.990]  All right, Jimmy's phone cut out because he was cussing.
[02:10:00.010 --> 02:10:01.290]  We hang up on folks when they do that.
[02:10:01.310 --> 02:10:04.331]  We can only delay it once, so I want to hear what you had to say.
[02:10:04.371 --> 02:10:05.011]  You called back in.
[02:10:05.051 --> 02:10:05.592]  I'm glad you did.
[02:10:05.612 --> 02:10:06.152]  Please don't cuss.
[02:10:06.492 --> 02:10:09.473]  Jimmy, what's your view on all the stuff that's coming and what's happening with the Mueller report?
[02:10:13.314 --> 02:10:16.555]  I think the truth is already out, and Trump just needs to go after them.
[02:10:17.538 --> 02:10:19.160]  The Democrats are just full of lies.
[02:10:19.220 --> 02:10:23.003]  That's all they're going to do is continue to lie and try to divide the country more.
[02:10:23.023 --> 02:10:23.983]  We need to go after them.
[02:10:24.103 --> 02:10:27.386]  We need to deploy the military, arrest them, and prosecute them.
[02:10:27.426 --> 02:10:28.167]  That's what we need to do.
[02:10:28.647 --> 02:10:29.368]  And let me say that.
[02:10:29.388 --> 02:10:31.129]  I don't like police, state, or martial law.
[02:10:31.249 --> 02:10:32.090]  Exactly.
[02:10:32.130 --> 02:10:33.071]  They're not going to stop.
[02:10:33.411 --> 02:10:35.573]  So what, are we just going to sit here and wait for them to do more stuff?
[02:10:36.673 --> 02:10:38.175]  Yeah, and we're not going to survive this.
[02:10:38.535 --> 02:10:41.657]  We're not going to survive this fucking cancer if we don't get rid of the tumor.
[02:10:41.677 --> 02:10:42.438]  Sorry about that.
[02:10:43.079 --> 02:10:45.841]  One more time, we've got to let you go.
[02:10:46.986 --> 02:10:50.309]  I want to hear you, but you can't say we can't survive this effing cancer.
[02:10:50.769 --> 02:10:51.670]  Let him call back in.
[02:10:51.730 --> 02:10:52.391]  Jimmy, can you hear me?
[02:10:53.452 --> 02:10:53.992]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[02:10:54.252 --> 02:10:55.033]  Don't cuss again.
[02:10:55.373 --> 02:10:56.054]  You're a smart guy.
[02:10:56.074 --> 02:10:56.734]  You don't need to cuss.
[02:10:56.754 --> 02:10:57.195]  We can't do it.
[02:10:57.215 --> 02:10:58.195]  We're on FCC stations.
[02:10:58.676 --> 02:10:58.996]  I agree.
[02:10:59.016 --> 02:11:00.337]  The Democrats can cuss on TV.
[02:11:00.357 --> 02:11:00.858]  Trump can.
[02:11:00.918 --> 02:11:01.338]  We can't.
[02:11:01.378 --> 02:11:02.359]  We're not as good as they are.
[02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:04.721]  What is your, I agree, gut level.
[02:11:04.821 --> 02:11:06.102]  I don't want a war with the Democrats.
[02:11:06.402 --> 02:11:07.683]  They're already attacking us.
[02:11:07.743 --> 02:11:08.544]  They won't stop.
[02:11:08.624 --> 02:11:09.185]  So what do we do?
[02:11:10.697 --> 02:11:11.978]  We need to go after them.
[02:11:11.998 --> 02:11:12.939]  We're already at war.
[02:11:13.039 --> 02:11:14.100]  Alex is already at war.
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:14.800]  The war has begun.
[02:11:14.820 --> 02:11:15.341]  It's started.
[02:11:15.361 --> 02:11:15.941]  We're in battle.
[02:11:16.182 --> 02:11:17.022]  There's no surrender.
[02:11:17.263 --> 02:11:17.863]  It's to the death.
[02:11:17.923 --> 02:11:18.804]  We need to take them out.
[02:11:19.224 --> 02:11:19.985]  We've got to arrest them.
[02:11:20.005 --> 02:11:20.785]  We've got to go after them.
[02:11:20.806 --> 02:11:21.686]  We've got to prosecute them.
[02:11:21.706 --> 02:11:22.787]  That's the only thing we can do.
[02:11:22.827 --> 02:11:25.529]  Well, the President and Stephen Miller, they listen.
[02:11:25.549 --> 02:11:26.370]  The Pentagon listens.
[02:11:26.791 --> 02:11:27.771]  What do you want them to do?
[02:11:28.892 --> 02:11:31.615]  They need to deploy the military and round them up.
[02:11:31.675 --> 02:11:32.575]  We've got the evidence.
[02:11:33.036 --> 02:11:33.436]  It's there.
[02:11:33.616 --> 02:11:34.697]  There's nothing else to wait for.
[02:11:34.997 --> 02:11:36.118]  We've been waiting for two years.
[02:11:37.019 --> 02:11:37.860]  The biggest hoax ever.
[02:11:39.281 --> 02:11:42.225]  Well it's true, they're not stopping and they're still trying to overthrow the country.
[02:11:42.946 --> 02:11:46.470]  And they're trying to cause, you turn on the news, it's all race war, it's just crazy.
[02:11:46.671 --> 02:11:50.175]  And all Americans want, Jimmy, is to live in peace, right?
[02:11:50.195 --> 02:11:55.062]  Yes, all we want to do is live in peace, no matter what color you are, we all want.
[02:12:00.407 --> 02:12:02.431]  The problem is Trump is surrounded by so many traitors.
[02:12:02.492 --> 02:12:08.946]  He would do the right thing, but I don't know what you do when there's all these cowards bred up in the swamp.
[02:12:09.447 --> 02:12:11.130]  Mainly, I'll just say it.
[02:12:12.853 --> 02:12:20.541]  It's all a bunch of weird white people, a bunch of weird, crazy, Harvard-educated white people that are out preaching race war because they want to control things.
[02:12:21.202 --> 02:12:23.004]  And I don't know what we do about it.
[02:12:23.544 --> 02:12:24.986]  I just, I don't know what we do about it.
[02:12:25.987 --> 02:12:31.232]  Because I sit there and I watch Nadler and all these people, and I just don't know.
[02:12:31.253 --> 02:12:31.993]  God bless you, Jimmy.
[02:12:32.013 --> 02:12:32.434]  Good points.
[02:12:35.151 --> 02:12:37.973]  I mean, they are up to their eyeballs with foreign governments.
[02:12:39.474 --> 02:12:41.296]  I have zero connection to foreign governments.
[02:12:41.896 --> 02:12:43.057]  Trump has zero connections.
[02:12:43.097 --> 02:12:50.963]  You don't even... You think Trump trusts people in his own government, much less he's gonna go in a hotel and have Russian women piss on him?
[02:12:55.006 --> 02:12:56.567]  Of course it turned out to be fake.
[02:13:00.230 --> 02:13:02.672]  But... Where do they go next?
[02:13:05.179 --> 02:13:06.000]  What do they do next?
[02:13:07.421 --> 02:13:08.142]  You know, I'll say this.
[02:13:08.262 --> 02:13:13.407]  One reason I haven't gotten violent is that all these globalists are nothing but targets.
[02:13:14.188 --> 02:13:15.009]  They're just minions.
[02:13:16.770 --> 02:13:19.933]  You could kill a thousand globalist minions, that wouldn't do a damn thing.
[02:13:19.973 --> 02:13:20.614]  It's a spirit.
[02:13:21.995 --> 02:13:23.337]  You kill it in your heart with God.
[02:13:23.737 --> 02:13:24.278]  I'm telling you.
[02:13:25.919 --> 02:13:27.581]  The most important thing I've said in 24 years on air,
[02:13:29.821 --> 02:13:30.762]  That's what I'm gonna say right now.
[02:13:31.942 --> 02:13:35.804]  You don't kill the globalists putting a bullet to their head or breaking their neck.
[02:13:37.065 --> 02:13:38.926]  If they're coming at you and your family, you got to do it.
[02:13:39.546 --> 02:13:42.268]  And I say, defend yourself and don't hesitate.
[02:13:44.529 --> 02:13:52.594]  But you kill them by loving God and being a good man and a good woman and not letting them intimidate you and speaking out.
[02:13:55.975 --> 02:13:56.956]  And that's what it comes down to.
[02:14:03.558 --> 02:14:06.179]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Maryland.
[02:14:06.199 --> 02:14:07.019]  You're on the air, Robert.
[02:14:07.059 --> 02:14:07.619]  Thanks for holding.
[02:14:07.639 --> 02:14:07.959]  Go ahead.
[02:14:09.559 --> 02:14:11.180]  Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:12.300]  Good to talk to you, brother.
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:14.661]  It's good to talk to you, brother.
[02:14:14.941 --> 02:14:17.541]  Do you remember the defense intelligence that I sent you?
[02:14:17.581 --> 02:14:20.942]  I think it's even, I've even stepped it up.
[02:14:21.002 --> 02:14:25.363]  I think the next defense intelligence that you need is to sell banners.
[02:14:26.070 --> 02:14:35.578]  And you need to efficiently use the Infowars Army and have every one of them have their own mini banner that they can hang up everywhere.
[02:14:35.978 --> 02:14:36.499]  No, I agree.
[02:14:36.519 --> 02:14:37.620]  People need to get out in the streets.
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:38.921]  That's the answer to censorship.
[02:14:40.722 --> 02:14:49.189]  And I think with this Mueller report, we need to take this victory in stride and we need to march forward towards 2020.
[02:14:50.550 --> 02:14:54.954]  After we win the election, we can take care of all these jackals and hyenas.
[02:14:58.627 --> 02:15:00.348]  I just don't know why everybody's so paralyzed.
[02:15:00.568 --> 02:15:08.052]  At a gut level, if the patriots in our government move against the traitors, they're going to fold like a house of cards.
[02:15:08.152 --> 02:15:10.533]  And I just think it's the safest course.
[02:15:10.613 --> 02:15:18.618]  It's not safe for me to say it, but I've already called for covert action against the Democrats.
[02:15:19.098 --> 02:15:20.479]  They're sold out to foreign powers.
[02:15:20.539 --> 02:15:21.059]  They're criminal.
[02:15:21.219 --> 02:15:22.180]  I'm not going to do it myself.
[02:15:22.220 --> 02:15:24.341]  That's not my forte, even though I could do it.
[02:15:25.717 --> 02:15:26.337]  No problem.
[02:15:26.958 --> 02:15:27.598]  We're gonna go to break.
[02:15:27.618 --> 02:15:29.879]  Come back with two minutes of this, and I'll come back to you, sir.
[02:15:30.079 --> 02:15:31.980]  I'm not running my mouth.
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:33.040]  Everybody knows, man.
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:35.942]  These people are a joke.
[02:15:35.962 --> 02:15:36.842]  They're very easy to be.
[02:15:37.242 --> 02:15:40.564]  You just gotta have the will to do it.
[02:15:40.624 --> 02:15:43.425]  I wanna play some of Narls Barkley when we come back on this side.
[02:15:43.445 --> 02:15:44.626]  Stay with us.
[02:15:44.726 --> 02:15:46.367]  I knew too much.
[02:16:04.594 --> 02:16:13.801]  I want to put forward an allegory or a story to explain where I'm coming from that parallels current real-time reality.
[02:16:14.241 --> 02:16:23.809]  So please bear with me a few minutes, because this is just bubbling up from my own thought processes of why am I sitting here with my shirt off.
[02:16:24.609 --> 02:16:25.090]  I'll explain.
[02:16:26.710 --> 02:16:30.892]  Our listeners, our viewers, are what Infowars really is.
[02:16:31.612 --> 02:16:38.656]  A populist, free market, pro-human movement that has detonated awakenings and resistance all over the world.
[02:16:39.496 --> 02:16:42.558]  We are the big giant tsunami coming in against globalist tyranny.
[02:16:43.358 --> 02:16:46.820]  You really are kicking globalist ass on every level.
[02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:47.920]  They're paying it.
[02:16:48.861 --> 02:16:50.721]  They thought that they had already won.
[02:16:52.362 --> 02:16:55.584]  But if they can still use corporate media to attack the leaders
[02:16:57.180 --> 02:16:58.581]  Of the resistance to globalism.
[02:16:58.921 --> 02:17:15.386]  And if they can strip us of who we really are, and then put banners on us, like a NASCAR, and claim that we support racism, or we support abusing women, or we support all these things we don't support, they can win.
[02:17:16.827 --> 02:17:25.990]  That's why it's important to strip it all away, what they've claimed, what they've said, the straw men they've built, and to tell people what you really stand for.
[02:17:27.008 --> 02:17:34.751]  But in this world of thousands and thousands of channels and millions of hosts, the truth gets drowned out sometimes.
[02:17:34.771 --> 02:17:36.352]  That's what the globalists are hoping is gonna happen.
[02:17:36.872 --> 02:17:41.714]  But out of all the shows and all the broadcasts out there, it's this show particularly they fear.
[02:17:42.375 --> 02:17:47.597]  Because we don't go off the pop culture they put out, we go off what they actually say, what they actually stand for.
[02:17:49.017 --> 02:17:52.299]  Now I was thinking as 2018 ended, now four months ago,
[02:17:53.737 --> 02:17:55.739]  I was thinking, what have I dropped the ball on?
[02:17:56.299 --> 02:17:58.561]  What's one area in the info where we haven't been effective?
[02:17:59.161 --> 02:18:00.322]  Where we were effective previously?
[02:18:01.023 --> 02:18:04.125]  And that's wearing our flags openly.
[02:18:05.066 --> 02:18:06.187]  Wearing our colors openly.
[02:18:07.848 --> 02:18:10.710]  And it starts with not being ashamed of the American flag that's under attack.
[02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:13.012]  The official Democrats want to remove it.
[02:18:13.892 --> 02:18:16.574]  Want to take Thomas Jefferson off the money.
[02:18:17.631 --> 02:18:18.472]  Saying he was a racist.
[02:18:18.552 --> 02:18:25.159]  I mean, they're even assaulting the flag now, so they're projecting all their lies under our great symbol and its great history.
[02:18:26.380 --> 02:18:31.465]  So first we have to strip away the lies they've put on us, like logos.
[02:18:32.226 --> 02:18:38.132]  Racist, homophobe, anti-female, criminal.
[02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:41.944]  A hoaxer, when they're the ones that are really doing all that.
[02:18:42.685 --> 02:18:49.095]  And then we have to display to everyone what we actually stand for, what we actually believe in.
[02:18:49.596 --> 02:18:52.160]  America and the world is already in a civil war.
[02:18:53.314 --> 02:18:55.036]  Pro-humans against the globalists.
[02:18:55.376 --> 02:18:58.379]  And we have to wear our colors loud and proud.
[02:18:58.779 --> 02:19:01.342]  And this is the best seller right now for last year.
[02:19:01.722 --> 02:19:03.764]  The InfoWars In Your Face.
[02:19:04.545 --> 02:19:08.789]  You know, I said to listeners, I said, hey, we've got Molon Labe, or we've got other shirts.
[02:19:08.809 --> 02:19:10.490]  We just want to meet like-minded people.
[02:19:11.731 --> 02:19:16.954]  But this shirt particularly, ladies and gentlemen, will really get in their face.
[02:19:17.354 --> 02:19:21.456]  And again, you'll get way more thumbs up and high fives and shake hands and meet friends.
[02:19:22.097 --> 02:19:27.480]  But there is that 1% or so out of the 100 people that see you that will say, F you, Russian agent.
[02:19:27.940 --> 02:19:28.480]  F you, traitor.
[02:19:28.540 --> 02:19:30.261]  But again, those are pathetic bots.
[02:19:30.842 --> 02:19:35.344]  And they want to intimidate you to not exercise your free speech.
[02:19:35.404 --> 02:19:36.765]  So don't let them.
[02:19:36.865 --> 02:19:38.646]  Don't ever back down to their tyranny.
[02:19:39.446 --> 02:19:43.169]  This week only, we're running the biggest sell ever on t-shirts across the board.
[02:19:43.189 --> 02:19:45.191]  50% off.
[02:19:45.511 --> 02:19:48.954]  From designer shirts, to you name it, to ball caps, all apparel.
[02:19:48.974 --> 02:19:55.700]  50% off for a limited time at InfowarsStore.com or call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:19:56.040 --> 02:19:58.142]  America has chosen Infowars.
[02:19:58.523 --> 02:20:02.206]  Loud, pro-America, pro-freedom, and in the bullies' faces.
[02:20:06.368 --> 02:20:09.069]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:17.032 --> 02:20:20.474]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[02:20:20.794 --> 02:20:21.454]  And this song.
[02:20:21.474 --> 02:20:24.455]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[02:20:24.855 --> 02:20:25.796]  And a little erotic.
[02:20:26.096 --> 02:20:27.677]  Even your emotions have an echo.
[02:20:27.757 --> 02:20:28.797]  It's getting higher.
[02:20:28.857 --> 02:20:29.797]  In so much space.
[02:20:29.877 --> 02:20:31.698]  In so much space.
[02:20:31.718 --> 02:20:33.059]  Truth is going insane.
[02:20:33.659 --> 02:20:35.300]  It's only upping your consciousness.
[02:20:38.123 --> 02:20:39.944]  Problem is, most people can't handle it.
[02:20:39.984 --> 02:20:41.765]  Then they go crazy.
[02:20:42.666 --> 02:20:43.486]  What'd turn us up?
[02:20:43.746 --> 02:20:46.928]  You'll never hate somebody for their race.
[02:20:47.088 --> 02:20:48.309]  You don't have them.
[02:20:48.449 --> 02:20:54.753]  You'll never hate a North Shaolin.
[02:20:55.293 --> 02:20:57.875]  You don't have them.
[02:20:57.895 --> 02:21:01.517]  You go straight to hell.
[02:21:04.406 --> 02:21:07.469]  That goes for all the black racists and white racists and all of you at the same time.
[02:21:08.109 --> 02:21:08.470]  Crank it up.
[02:21:09.210 --> 02:21:13.514]  That's my only advice.
[02:21:13.534 --> 02:21:15.255]  You think you're in control.
[02:21:15.335 --> 02:21:16.096]  Bless your heart.
[02:21:41.636 --> 02:21:53.005]  Possibly.
[02:21:55.747 --> 02:21:58.329]  All through my life, the heroes have been the ones.
[02:21:58.349 --> 02:21:58.830]  Who are they?
[02:22:16.476 --> 02:22:17.817]  And I can die when I'm done.
[02:22:17.897 --> 02:22:19.338]  And I can die when I'm done.
[02:22:19.378 --> 02:22:20.379]  That's right.
[02:22:20.459 --> 02:22:22.280]  Carry out the mission.
[02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:23.741]  Does that make me crazy?
[02:22:23.781 --> 02:22:26.883]  Because Norris Barkley saw the blueprint.
[02:22:26.963 --> 02:22:27.904]  He transcended fear.
[02:22:27.964 --> 02:22:29.385]  He became born again.
[02:23:09.605 --> 02:23:10.786]  That's good stuff right there.
[02:23:14.149 --> 02:23:14.409]  All right.
[02:23:15.330 --> 02:23:16.210]  Back to your phone calls.
[02:23:17.311 --> 02:23:31.723]  And then I'll hit the vaccine news on the other side, which I think you already know, but you understand the burden, the frustration, how much I hate myself, that I don't do a good enough job preparing to like explain how important this is.
[02:23:32.164 --> 02:23:33.725]  That's why I do these theatrics.
[02:23:35.418 --> 02:23:39.061]  Because if you're just like, oh, by the way, here's a diamond in the rough, nobody cares.
[02:23:39.721 --> 02:23:41.563]  If you say, oh, here's the big news, nobody cares.
[02:23:41.583 --> 02:23:44.004]  But if you build it up, maybe folks care.
[02:23:44.044 --> 02:23:46.066]  Maybe kids don't get brain damaged.
[02:23:47.947 --> 02:23:48.768]  Main little boys.
[02:23:51.250 --> 02:23:51.450]  You know?
[02:23:53.769 --> 02:23:57.893]  We brain damage our little boys because deep down we're used to men getting killed and used up.
[02:23:58.553 --> 02:23:59.374]  Globeless are smart.
[02:24:00.355 --> 02:24:07.581]  You know, if 1 in 58 little girls couldn't change their diaper when they were 20 years old, we'd do something about it, wouldn't we?
[02:24:08.882 --> 02:24:12.465]  But our little boys need to stick their chins up and tough it out, don't they?
[02:24:14.352 --> 02:24:15.073]  That's not sick.
[02:24:16.934 --> 02:24:17.714]  I'll be honest with you.
[02:24:17.735 --> 02:24:28.682]  I got a 16 year old son who's super handsome and 6'2 already and super smart and first in his class and I just genetically don't worry about him.
[02:24:30.043 --> 02:24:31.645]  My three daughters are so spoiled.
[02:24:32.445 --> 02:24:37.449]  The only thing I think about, but see that's genetic because he's a man.
[02:24:38.229 --> 02:24:38.950]  He's not a woman.
[02:24:44.537 --> 02:24:45.777]  Think about how we treat our men.
[02:24:45.797 --> 02:24:48.138]  That's okay, though.
[02:24:48.438 --> 02:24:49.679]  That's what men are supposed to be treated like.
[02:24:51.299 --> 02:24:58.442]  But they do this sick alchemy of trying to claim women are men when men are men and women are women and everybody knows it.
[02:24:59.362 --> 02:25:11.586]  And the great crime is saying we're not the same thing because the magic of the man and the woman in that holy alchemy creating a new creature
[02:25:14.332 --> 02:25:15.554]  It's something the devil hates.
[02:25:19.599 --> 02:25:30.213]  And I watch so many people I've known who've joined the dark side, who've joined Lucifer, believing that they would be given some type of enlightenment.
[02:25:32.526 --> 02:25:35.591]  And all they're given is bondage to the system they signed on to.
[02:25:35.611 --> 02:25:38.796]  And there's always more demands.
[02:25:40.379 --> 02:25:40.879]  By the devil.
[02:25:42.101 --> 02:25:43.604]  God doesn't make more demands.
[02:25:44.445 --> 02:25:46.188]  You want to give yourself to God.
[02:25:47.796 --> 02:25:49.618]  God always says, are you sure you want to do that?
[02:25:50.578 --> 02:25:51.179]  Not the devil.
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:53.541]  The devil says you're going to do that.
[02:25:54.902 --> 02:25:58.445]  And so that's all I'm saying is, people better choose which side they're on.
[02:25:58.926 --> 02:26:08.153]  We've got Stacey, and we've got Gary, and we've got Jacob, and we've got Bob, and we've got Danny, and we've got Berger, who's been holding.
[02:26:08.294 --> 02:26:11.957]  Berger has been holding for an hour and 11 minutes in California.
[02:26:12.617 --> 02:26:13.538]  Welcome, Berger.
[02:26:13.578 --> 02:26:14.339]  Thank you for calling.
[02:26:16.414 --> 02:26:16.974]  Right, Alex.
[02:26:17.034 --> 02:26:18.254]  I want to talk to you for a minute.
[02:26:18.314 --> 02:26:21.915]  I just want to say, like I said, the Bureau of Report is all fake.
[02:26:22.615 --> 02:26:27.156]  And like I said, what they're doing is they're playing with 300 million people's lives out here.
[02:26:27.776 --> 02:26:29.517]  That's how many real Americans are out here.
[02:26:29.877 --> 02:26:33.878]  But from that report alone, I got Democrat friends all over Facebook.
[02:26:34.258 --> 02:26:35.638]  And they just started believing it.
[02:26:35.858 --> 02:26:36.878]  And it's been two years.
[02:26:37.718 --> 02:26:40.799]  And the point is, the military has to step in.
[02:26:41.139 --> 02:26:43.860]  Like the other politicians, they have to step in.
[02:26:45.675 --> 02:26:47.336]  Like I said, they don't build this border wall.
[02:26:47.716 --> 02:26:48.696]  We've been compromised.
[02:26:48.996 --> 02:26:52.357]  And I got this from Lyndon LaRouche about the British invasion.
[02:26:53.177 --> 02:26:53.938]  This is the truth.
[02:26:54.258 --> 02:26:56.899]  We don't need just a border wall on the southern side.
[02:26:57.239 --> 02:27:00.520]  We need one on the northern side, too, because the Muslims are pouring in.
[02:27:00.940 --> 02:27:06.282]  And again, it's not the British people, but yeah, the British imperial model is manipulating this.
[02:27:06.302 --> 02:27:07.362]  That's exactly what's going on.
[02:27:08.046 --> 02:27:09.226]  That's exactly what's going on.
[02:27:09.266 --> 02:27:15.107]  That's what we're trying to tell people, but like I said, they've been wanting this country since it was founded by George Washington.
[02:27:15.447 --> 02:27:16.327]  That's the whole point.
[02:27:16.627 --> 02:27:25.449]  So what happened was, we've just been assassinating presidents, and like I said, just taking over the military, and I just think we broke down completely.
[02:27:25.769 --> 02:27:28.810]  Everything's been sold to China, the infrastructure's gone.
[02:27:29.090 --> 02:27:30.590]  I mean, you can see this from your own eyes.
[02:27:31.030 --> 02:27:36.671]  And how crazy is it to watch Trump trying to just do basic good and being opposed?
[02:27:37.788 --> 02:27:38.929]  Listen, I prayed for Trump.
[02:27:39.249 --> 02:27:40.689]  I didn't even know he was going to be in office.
[02:27:41.050 --> 02:27:47.472]  I told my wife before he was even thinking about running, I said, unless we get a border wall, this is the only way we're going to survive.
[02:27:47.913 --> 02:27:48.733]  This is the only way.
[02:27:48.773 --> 02:27:50.134]  And I've seen what they did to Europe.
[02:27:50.494 --> 02:27:53.575]  I've seen how they pulled the Africans in and how they just let them in.
[02:27:53.875 --> 02:27:54.836]  And it's unbelievable.
[02:27:54.916 --> 02:27:56.536]  It's the same thing happening here.
[02:27:56.837 --> 02:27:57.877]  And we can't tell that.
[02:27:58.277 --> 02:27:59.378]  And the military can't.
[02:27:59.878 --> 02:28:00.758]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:28:00.798 --> 02:28:01.339]  No, they know.
[02:28:02.059 --> 02:28:02.499]  They know.
[02:28:02.699 --> 02:28:03.139]  They know.
[02:28:03.259 --> 02:28:03.680]  So it's...
[02:28:05.293 --> 02:28:05.915]  It's crazy.
[02:28:06.116 --> 02:28:09.145]  And to see how many Americans are against the country, really, it makes me sad.
[02:28:12.105 --> 02:28:13.285]  I'm from California.
[02:28:13.645 --> 02:28:18.086]  We done lost a lot of black lives over here due to this Democratic invasion that they've brung on us.
[02:28:18.486 --> 02:28:20.127]  And we was on the front lines, bro.
[02:28:20.447 --> 02:28:28.408]  If there ain't even no more black people kind of left in Los Angeles, they done flooded us so much to where, man, our gangs won't even exist if we haven't.
[02:28:28.908 --> 02:28:29.529]  It's over.
[02:28:29.949 --> 02:28:32.849]  I mean, they've been murdering us, getting away with it.
[02:28:33.009 --> 02:28:34.530]  They crossed back to the border.
[02:28:35.030 --> 02:28:35.830]  We can't do that.
[02:28:36.250 --> 02:28:37.190]  We cannot do that.
[02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:39.111]  They keep coming over, killing us.
[02:28:39.151 --> 02:28:40.691]  Brother, this is World War IV.
[02:28:41.511 --> 02:28:42.772]  This is it.
[02:28:42.832 --> 02:28:44.153]  This is the takedown of America.
[02:28:45.054 --> 02:28:49.457]  And we got a president trying to do something, but he's not going hard enough, man.
[02:28:49.477 --> 02:28:52.159]  These Democrats need to be politically dealt with.
[02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:54.061]  They need to be wiped out.
[02:28:54.121 --> 02:28:55.002]  They're not Americans.
[02:28:55.802 --> 02:28:56.723]  They went over the line.
[02:28:57.303 --> 02:28:58.404]  They drew first blood.
[02:29:09.642 --> 02:29:12.004]  I don't claim to be some Pharisee up here on a high horse.
[02:29:12.084 --> 02:29:13.946]  It's perfect, but I love God and I love Christ.
[02:29:14.687 --> 02:29:15.888]  And we're not tax-exempt.
[02:29:15.908 --> 02:29:16.889]  The government can't regulate us.
[02:29:17.449 --> 02:29:25.616]  But when you buy a book, you buy a video, you buy a t-shirt, you buy coffee every month, you buy toothpaste every month, you buy stuff like protein bars every month on auto-ship.
[02:29:25.636 --> 02:29:27.678]  You can do it every two months, every three months, every four months.
[02:29:27.698 --> 02:29:28.559]  Just click the button.
[02:29:28.599 --> 02:29:29.700]  Cancel for free anytime.
[02:29:30.201 --> 02:29:34.745]  You can tithe a little bit of profit we make on each one to fund this operation.
[02:29:36.004 --> 02:29:39.029]  Push us into the black, and help us stand in the face of the globalists.
[02:29:39.049 --> 02:29:44.116]  So please, a lot of the great losers have done this, and we salute them, we thank them, but if you haven't, habituate.
[02:29:44.537 --> 02:29:47.261]  Go to infowarestore.com and get a t-shirt.

[02:29:57.654 --> 02:29:58.935]  Don't California my Texas.
[02:29:59.095 --> 02:29:59.616]  Baseball.
[02:29:59.856 --> 02:30:01.097]  The jersey style ones.
[02:30:01.137 --> 02:30:01.658]  Ball caps.
[02:30:01.698 --> 02:30:02.179]  You name it.
[02:30:02.219 --> 02:30:03.300]  Big discounts on that.
[02:30:03.440 --> 02:30:05.442]  Big discounts on Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:30:05.482 --> 02:30:06.763]  Four-stage ion filters.
[02:30:06.783 --> 02:30:08.005]  Leading competitors at 500, 600 bucks.
[02:30:08.025 --> 02:30:09.086]  These are great deals at 300.
[02:30:09.186 --> 02:30:09.306]  It's

[02:30:12.068 --> 02:30:12.228]  $50 off.
[02:30:12.288 --> 02:30:14.589]  That helps fund our operation.
[02:30:14.649 --> 02:30:16.669]  And we have the best deal on food ever.
[02:30:16.729 --> 02:30:18.350]  It's in these high quality plastic.
[02:30:18.490 --> 02:30:20.351]  I mean, I mean, hell, just a plastic container.
[02:30:20.451 --> 02:30:21.511]  Walmart costs as much.
[02:30:21.691 --> 02:30:25.853]  Those nice, snap top plastic, high quality, rubber made type material.
[02:30:25.993 --> 02:30:30.594]  Then it's got a two week food supply in a big tote container.
[02:30:30.774 --> 02:30:33.195]  1,500 calories a day, 92 servings.
[02:30:33.475 --> 02:30:37.057]  You can see that's already got 97% positive reviews, 4.8%
[02:30:38.237 --> 02:30:41.299]  That is the best deal on high-quality, storable food out there.
[02:30:41.319 --> 02:30:45.541]  And it's great to have one in your garage, one in your car, one at work in case something goes down.
[02:30:45.702 --> 02:30:48.263]  Or you can give it to people for charity or give it to homeless down the road.
[02:30:48.283 --> 02:30:49.184]  It lasts 25 years.
[02:30:49.244 --> 02:30:50.625]  This is the best deal ever.
[02:30:50.765 --> 02:30:56.008]  You have a two-week supply, ladies and gentlemen, that is more than 50% off.
[02:30:56.128 --> 02:30:57.869]  It is at cost.
[02:30:58.570 --> 02:31:00.912]  $67.
[02:30:59.711 --> 02:31:00.912]  That is at cost.
[02:31:01.052 --> 02:31:03.854]  As a promotional, they're doing, because they want you to see how great it is.
[02:31:03.895 --> 02:31:04.655]  It's a loss leader.
[02:31:04.815 --> 02:31:06.217]  InfoWars Life Select.
[02:31:06.337 --> 02:31:07.818]  By that, it's private label.
[02:31:07.838 --> 02:31:09.180]  My Patriot Supply will be good around.
[02:31:09.320 --> 02:31:11.362]  Contracts they have with distributors go the lowest.
[02:31:11.602 --> 02:31:14.785]  Us being a private labeler, it's a private label at the very same factory.
[02:31:14.825 --> 02:31:15.826]  Fresh, high-quality food.
[02:31:15.906 --> 02:31:16.587]  So it's all there.
[02:31:16.607 --> 02:31:16.587]  $67.
[02:31:17.027 --> 02:31:19.349]  Two-week food supply.
[02:31:19.469 --> 02:31:22.652]  Just the container itself, it'll cost close to that at Walmart.
[02:31:22.852 --> 02:31:23.373]  It's also high
[02:31:23.473 --> 02:31:24.253]  Completely reusable.
[02:31:24.353 --> 02:31:26.915]  Each meal is in its own vacuum-sealed packet.
[02:31:27.055 --> 02:31:27.435]  Amazing.

[02:31:44.662 --> 02:31:45.243]  They're all there.
[02:31:45.343 --> 02:31:45.923]  Hundreds of them.

[02:32:15.288 --> 02:32:17.790]  Often a result of poor diet and lifestyle habits.
[02:32:18.010 --> 02:32:21.414]  An occasionally constipated colon can cause massive problems.
[02:32:21.735 --> 02:32:27.943]  Our researchers combined ancient ingredients traditionally used to combat these issues in an affordable way.
[02:32:28.203 --> 02:32:34.251]  Other harsh, stimulant laxatives can create massive discomfort in trying to solve intestinal issues.

[02:33:06.323 --> 02:33:10.387]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:15.591 --> 02:33:22.597]  What I hate is looking up and seeing chemtrails in a clear blue sky today.
[02:33:22.617 --> 02:33:23.958]  What I hate is
[02:33:32.600 --> 02:33:40.168]  That's Merle Haggard, who, by the way, was a big listener.
[02:33:41.289 --> 02:33:46.194]  And I'm not going to get into private stories, but we almost got him on the show, but he just didn't come on.
[02:33:46.234 --> 02:33:50.838]  You know, I'm not name-dropping, because I really don't care about famous people, unless they're Willie Nelson.
[02:33:51.899 --> 02:33:55.063]  And I got to be pretty good friends with Willie Nelson.
[02:33:56.493 --> 02:33:58.234]  Because they thought I didn't like Bush.
[02:33:58.514 --> 02:34:03.417]  And as soon as Obama got in, his wife flipped out on me when I was at his house.
[02:34:05.498 --> 02:34:08.099]  And Willie apologized, but you know, it's okay.
[02:34:08.119 --> 02:34:09.540]  I think it's like his fifth wife.
[02:34:11.180 --> 02:34:14.822]  But you know, the Willie Nelson you see at 86 on the road is not the real Willie Nelson.
[02:34:14.862 --> 02:34:16.423]  That guy's like a wind-up toy now.
[02:34:16.463 --> 02:34:19.985]  They put up there on the, put up there on stage.
[02:34:20.005 --> 02:34:23.727]  Now I'm not a marijuana smoker.
[02:34:24.841 --> 02:34:30.285]  But about 15 years ago, first time hanging out with Willie Nelson on his bus, he's got a vapor before we'd ever seen him.
[02:34:30.305 --> 02:34:32.106]  It was like this big, they call it a volcano.
[02:34:32.626 --> 02:34:37.610]  It's got this big ball on it, and it's the only, he's like, he goes, here, I'm gonna take a hit off this.
[02:34:37.630 --> 02:34:39.711]  He goes, take some.
[02:34:39.751 --> 02:34:41.232]  It's like a spit stripping off of it.
[02:34:41.252 --> 02:34:42.113]  It's like a peace pipe.
[02:34:42.813 --> 02:34:44.635]  And I'm like, I've never had a dude spit in my mouth.
[02:34:44.655 --> 02:34:46.856]  It's the gayest thing I ever did, but I took it.
[02:34:46.916 --> 02:34:52.120]  And meanwhile, I'm crawling through the parking lot two hours later, had to call somebody to come get me.
[02:34:53.985 --> 02:34:55.166]  Because the weed was so strong.
[02:34:56.026 --> 02:34:58.607]  So I guess that's why they said they're going to roll him up and smoke him.
[02:34:58.987 --> 02:35:02.869]  Now I'd known Nelson five years before that photo was taken right there.
[02:35:03.670 --> 02:35:06.591]  That's me and Jesse Ventura with Willie Nelson in his house.
[02:35:07.552 --> 02:35:10.613]  He's got his own little town called Luck outside Austin.
[02:35:11.514 --> 02:35:13.615]  Bunch of old buildings, shoots a bunch of movies out there.
[02:35:13.635 --> 02:35:16.436]  But that was when he was like 75 years old.
[02:35:16.456 --> 02:35:17.257]  I met Willie when he was about 70.
[02:35:19.605 --> 02:35:22.690]  He's 86 now, so I've known him a long time.
[02:35:23.772 --> 02:35:24.873]  So that's not name-dropping.
[02:35:25.554 --> 02:35:31.243]  I don't care about Hollywood people, but Willie Nelson, a little different, because...
[02:35:32.602 --> 02:35:36.463]  There's, like, three different types of people in the area of Texas he's from.
[02:35:36.483 --> 02:35:38.664]  My family's from the county right next to his county.
[02:35:39.464 --> 02:35:45.927]  There's kind of the nice, friendly Scott-type guys with long hair that are real friendly, but they're actually tough guys like Willie Nelson.
[02:35:46.607 --> 02:35:51.629]  There's kind of the big old Bubba Chop types, the Chad types, and there's kind of the church-going types.
[02:35:52.829 --> 02:35:54.950]  Just Willie Nelson's so much like my family.
[02:35:55.770 --> 02:35:57.951]  All my people I know, most of them are dead now.
[02:35:58.911 --> 02:36:00.352]  Old great-uncles and all the rest of it.
[02:36:00.372 --> 02:36:00.992]  It's just weird.
[02:36:02.961 --> 02:36:03.821]  To know Willie Nelson.
[02:36:06.462 --> 02:36:07.522]  I know he's a good guy.
[02:36:09.622 --> 02:36:12.963]  You know, Willie Nelson sought me out.
[02:36:14.183 --> 02:36:15.163]  I was showing in-game.
[02:36:17.163 --> 02:36:20.664]  I talked to him before, met him once before, but I was showing in-game like 12 years ago.
[02:36:20.684 --> 02:36:22.324]  That's when he came on the air.
[02:36:23.845 --> 02:36:28.825]  And, uh... People are... I gave a speech.
[02:36:28.845 --> 02:36:32.226]  People are like, Willie Nelson's in the back, he wants to talk to you.
[02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:34.760]  He goes, oh, I met you before.
[02:36:34.780 --> 02:36:35.441]  I like what you're doing.
[02:36:35.461 --> 02:36:36.541]  You need to come over to my house.
[02:36:36.561 --> 02:36:37.321]  I want to come on your show.
[02:36:37.341 --> 02:36:38.161]  I'm like, OK, sure.
[02:36:38.602 --> 02:36:39.142]  Here's my number.
[02:36:39.162 --> 02:36:39.642]  Yeah, right.
[02:36:39.662 --> 02:36:40.742]  Then Willie Nelson starts calling me.
[02:36:41.282 --> 02:36:43.243]  And man, when I had his numbers, I could call him up.
[02:36:43.283 --> 02:36:44.243]  He talked for like an hour.
[02:36:45.044 --> 02:36:45.964]  Like a real guy, you know?
[02:36:47.925 --> 02:36:50.566]  But he just believes in bleeding heart bullshit.
[02:36:50.826 --> 02:36:51.186]  Bulls.
[02:36:52.026 --> 02:36:52.646]  Bullhucky.
[02:36:55.007 --> 02:36:58.448]  Because he hears Beto and Bernie Sanders say, we're going to give everybody free stuff.
[02:36:58.508 --> 02:37:01.089]  And he goes, that sounds like a good thing.
[02:37:04.380 --> 02:37:07.081]  And he's giving away almost every bit of his money.
[02:37:07.101 --> 02:37:12.003]  I remember, like, 15 years ago, he goes, you know, you're doing good work exposing 9-11.
[02:37:12.123 --> 02:37:13.243]  He goes, you need any money?
[02:37:13.963 --> 02:37:15.004]  I'll just write you a check.
[02:37:15.884 --> 02:37:16.544]  How much you need?
[02:37:16.564 --> 02:37:17.464]  A couple hundred thousand.
[02:37:19.465 --> 02:37:21.466]  And I was like, Mr. Nelson, I don't want your money.
[02:37:24.007 --> 02:37:33.850]  But see, that's what the leftists do, is they manipulate good-hearted people like Willie.
[02:37:35.677 --> 02:37:36.177]  Look at Willie.
[02:37:36.197 --> 02:37:38.059]  That's a good-hearted person in that photo.
[02:37:38.559 --> 02:37:39.540]  With Pito O'Rourke.
[02:37:39.640 --> 02:37:41.361]  And Pito's a big-ass predator.
[02:37:43.763 --> 02:37:45.264]  So it just makes me sick sometimes.
[02:37:51.488 --> 02:37:54.510]  But that wasn't a name-dropping story.
[02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:56.611]  I guess we're coming in with country music, so I got into that.
[02:37:57.052 --> 02:38:01.515]  Maybe we should intro the next segment with a little Waila Jennings.
[02:38:05.324 --> 02:38:12.108]  Looking back, Texas is good too, but there's only two things in this world that make it worth living.
[02:38:13.869 --> 02:38:17.331]  Guitars that tune good and firm feeling women.
[02:38:19.253 --> 02:38:20.633]  I think that's probably true.
[02:38:21.474 --> 02:38:26.557]  No, it's that live rendition of Silver Stallion.
[02:38:27.698 --> 02:38:29.358]  The part where it's queued up to Waylon Jennings.
[02:38:29.919 --> 02:38:31.480]  I'm gonna find me a reckless woman.
[02:38:32.554 --> 02:38:34.454]  With razor blades and dice in her eyes.
[02:38:35.095 --> 02:38:37.075]  And just a touch of sadness in her fingers.
[02:38:37.875 --> 02:38:39.576]  And thunder and lightning in her thighs.
[02:38:40.536 --> 02:38:41.996]  Who comes up with stuff like that?
[02:38:42.036 --> 02:38:42.816]  It's totally true.
[02:38:44.457 --> 02:38:47.398]  I'm gonna find me a reckless woman.
[02:38:48.138 --> 02:38:51.339]  With razor blades and dice in her eyes.
[02:38:52.239 --> 02:38:55.279]  And just a touch of sadness in her fingers.
[02:38:56.100 --> 02:38:59.360]  And thunder and lightning in her thighs.
[02:39:00.121 --> 02:39:01.321]  Collar's been holding long enough here.
[02:39:02.363 --> 02:39:03.503]  Well, you got 30 phone lines.
[02:39:03.923 --> 02:39:05.764]  Everybody's got a hold, so I appreciate it, buddy.
[02:39:06.164 --> 02:39:07.785]  Danny in Virginia, you're on the air.
[02:39:07.845 --> 02:39:08.625]  Welcome to the Airwaves.
[02:39:08.645 --> 02:39:09.045]  Go ahead.
[02:39:11.026 --> 02:39:11.526]  Hey, Alex.
[02:39:11.546 --> 02:39:12.346]  Thanks for all you do.
[02:39:12.366 --> 02:39:13.146]  Can you hear me?
[02:39:14.427 --> 02:39:18.928]  And thank you to your crew, and thank you to you for being in the crosshairs and happy to be there.
[02:39:19.768 --> 02:39:20.068]  I love it.
[02:39:21.689 --> 02:39:29.331]  Anyway, I think what we're all stumbling over is what Mr. Trump needs to do, and he needs to be the first president to recognize that the United States Constitution was
[02:39:30.991 --> 02:39:36.615]  No, you're right.
[02:39:36.695 --> 02:39:39.136]  We're under a bureaucratic dictatorship.
[02:39:39.476 --> 02:39:42.438]  So when I call for Trump to be dictator, it's only to end the dictatorship.
[02:39:42.678 --> 02:39:44.259]  Which is very smart of you to say that.
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:53.904]  Right, and you need to be the intellectual leader of the movement to get him on that point and say, Mr. President, you have to recognize that the only way we win this is to win it quickly.
[02:39:54.264 --> 02:39:55.445]  It's got to be a blitzkrieg.
[02:39:55.845 --> 02:39:57.766]  You've got to take these people into custody overnight.
[02:39:58.026 --> 02:40:02.669]  And he's the only type of leader like Washington who... Washington signed thousands of death warrants.
[02:40:03.069 --> 02:40:04.930]  He's the only person who'll turn it loose once he's done it.
[02:40:06.090 --> 02:40:07.191]  Right, I don't want death warrants.
[02:40:07.231 --> 02:40:12.834]  I just want people locked up and I want them coerced into confessing as to working for the globalists.
[02:40:13.034 --> 02:40:14.074]  No, but let's be honest.
[02:40:14.134 --> 02:40:15.155]  Death warrants are quicker.
[02:40:16.451 --> 02:40:17.852]  I know, but we need the confessions.
[02:40:17.952 --> 02:40:19.912]  We need these people to admit what they were up to.
[02:40:20.232 --> 02:40:23.554]  And the way you kill a globalist is to take their children into protective custody.
[02:40:24.094 --> 02:40:26.255]  If you own their bloodline, you own them.
[02:40:27.335 --> 02:40:27.935]  No, I agree.
[02:40:27.995 --> 02:40:30.756]  And most of their children are 45, 50 and are involved in the crime.
[02:40:30.956 --> 02:40:32.197]  Here's the deal.
[02:40:32.237 --> 02:40:33.197]  They're trying to destroy me.
[02:40:33.277 --> 02:40:33.918]  I know who they are.
[02:40:33.938 --> 02:40:36.799]  I don't sell this stuff and be like, shoot my mouth off.
[02:40:36.839 --> 02:40:38.059]  This will be on the news tonight.
[02:40:38.599 --> 02:40:39.120]  I agree, man.
[02:40:39.140 --> 02:40:41.000]  This is a foreign criminal group.
[02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:41.821]  We need to move against them.
[02:40:41.841 --> 02:40:42.681]  So what do you think Trump should do?
[02:40:44.969 --> 02:40:58.575]  Well, I mean, first thing I would do is I'd have the Senate call Mueller before them and have him answer how long did he have this determination that there was no collusion and how long did he... And when was his first meeting with Rosenstein and Comey?
[02:40:58.615 --> 02:41:03.357]  Right, but he clearly held this report until after the midterm elections.
[02:41:03.397 --> 02:41:04.558]  He knew there was no collusion.
[02:41:05.757 --> 02:41:06.297]  8, 10 months ago.
[02:41:06.317 --> 02:41:08.559]  That's right, he meddled in the 2018 election.
[02:41:09.039 --> 02:41:09.460]  Exactly.
[02:41:09.500 --> 02:41:15.485]  If you make that case publicly before the Senate, then this whole thing withers away that this whole thing wasn't political.
[02:41:18.248 --> 02:41:20.610]  So sap the energy out of that, because they're never going to let go of this.
[02:41:20.730 --> 02:41:21.290]  Well, I agree.
[02:41:21.491 --> 02:41:29.037]  You know, I'm not a violent person, but I know how many people Deep State have killed because they've never seen this disruptive.
[02:41:30.885 --> 02:41:32.065]  What do you think of the globalists?
[02:41:32.365 --> 02:41:33.346]  We're not calling for this.
[02:41:33.446 --> 02:41:34.106]  We're non-violent.
[02:41:34.446 --> 02:41:36.106]  What if the globalists got a bloody nose?
[02:41:36.206 --> 02:41:37.507]  Would you think they might go away or no?
[02:41:37.527 --> 02:41:38.087]  They can't help it.
[02:41:39.427 --> 02:41:40.807]  There is no way they're going to go away.
[02:41:41.768 --> 02:41:43.048]  That's just not in their nature.
[02:41:43.088 --> 02:41:45.288]  They're just like parasites that need a host.
[02:41:45.588 --> 02:41:46.949]  They just have to be able to feed on us.
[02:41:47.169 --> 02:41:47.489]  You're right.
[02:41:47.509 --> 02:41:48.309]  They're robotic.
[02:41:48.409 --> 02:41:49.329]  They're not higher order.
[02:41:50.190 --> 02:41:50.390]  Right.
[02:41:52.190 --> 02:41:52.970]  But I love what you're doing.
[02:41:52.990 --> 02:41:53.430]  Keep doing it.
[02:41:53.470 --> 02:41:53.710]  No, no.
[02:41:53.750 --> 02:41:54.451]  Let me hear more from you.
[02:41:54.491 --> 02:41:55.451]  Don't hang up, Danny.
[02:41:55.491 --> 02:41:57.131]  So, no, I mean, I agree.
[02:41:57.431 --> 02:41:58.411]  So what does Trump need to do?
[02:41:58.492 --> 02:42:00.352]  He needs to... What does he need to do?
[02:42:02.833 --> 02:42:04.809]  Well, I mean, we have to we have to certainly, uh.
[02:42:09.631 --> 02:42:11.252]  It's like Norris Barkley, we gotta get crazy.
[02:42:11.432 --> 02:42:17.916]  We gotta let them know that we have formed a weapon against them that they can't overcome, that we're gonna go where we have to go to get this done.
[02:42:18.277 --> 02:42:21.059]  You have to threaten them with something that they actually believe could be done to them.
[02:42:22.039 --> 02:42:22.520]  No, I agree.
[02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:29.284]  I mean, how arrogant are they to be all over the news saying they're gonna impeach the president when they're the ones caught trying to overthrow an election?
[02:42:29.824 --> 02:42:33.147]  It's just, they're just a bunch, and all the lies they've told, I mean, my God.
[02:42:33.937 --> 02:42:42.201]  But you could invalidate all of the elections over the last hundred years just saying that the money aspect of electioneering is bribery.
[02:42:42.601 --> 02:42:45.563]  It's all... Well, let me make an announcement when we come back, Danny.
[02:42:46.643 --> 02:42:48.724]  But I... I'm betting on Trump.
[02:42:48.764 --> 02:42:53.487]  I think Trump knows existentially they're going to destroy him unless he does what must be done.
[02:42:54.167 --> 02:42:56.548]  Do what must be done, Lord Vader!
[02:43:02.970 --> 02:43:04.911]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:43:04.931 --> 02:43:05.371]  Go ahead.
[02:43:05.652 --> 02:43:07.853]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:43:07.873 --> 02:43:10.895]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:43:11.715 --> 02:43:12.856]  It just gets old, man.
[02:43:13.156 --> 02:43:14.877]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:43:15.577 --> 02:43:17.659]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:17.899 --> 02:43:21.881]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:21.901 --> 02:43:23.182]  Do you understand?
[02:43:23.262 --> 02:43:24.343]  I'm ringing the alarm.
[02:43:25.203 --> 02:43:27.524]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:27.884 --> 02:43:28.965]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:43:29.245 --> 02:43:30.125]  Us being shut down?
[02:43:30.365 --> 02:43:31.406]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:43:31.826 --> 02:43:32.866]  You know what, Alex?
[02:43:32.906 --> 02:43:33.987]  Put him on pause again.
[02:43:34.007 --> 02:43:34.847]  Hey, Frank!
[02:43:35.127 --> 02:43:40.469]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:43:40.769 --> 02:43:45.071]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:43:45.291 --> 02:43:48.172]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:43:48.432 --> 02:43:48.793]  You understand?
[02:43:48.893 --> 02:43:50.173]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:50.533 --> 02:43:51.654]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:52.654 --> 02:43:57.576]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[02:43:58.517 --> 02:43:59.237]  Do you understand?
[02:43:59.357 --> 02:44:00.518]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:44:02.999 --> 02:44:06.020]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[02:44:06.380 --> 02:44:12.303]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[02:44:12.723 --> 02:44:18.586]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[02:44:18.906 --> 02:44:21.527]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[02:44:21.807 --> 02:44:29.315]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[02:44:29.335 --> 02:44:37.544]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[02:44:38.145 --> 02:44:42.410]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[02:44:43.271 --> 02:44:46.872]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[02:44:47.072 --> 02:44:53.034]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[02:44:54.014 --> 02:45:02.856]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[02:45:03.416 --> 02:45:07.597]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[02:45:07.617 --> 02:45:09.378]  You're probably going, wait a minute.
[02:45:10.452 --> 02:45:12.297]  For the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[02:45:12.317 --> 02:45:13.601]  It was the last run.
[02:45:13.621 --> 02:45:14.563]  It's been sold out for two months.
[02:45:15.643 --> 02:45:16.504]  How is X2 back?
[02:45:17.004 --> 02:45:20.606]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[02:45:21.087 --> 02:45:24.149]  We got put over the barrel, some industrial sabotage, we couldn't get it anymore.
[02:45:24.749 --> 02:45:34.776]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep-earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[02:45:34.856 --> 02:45:38.779]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[02:45:39.219 --> 02:45:40.340]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:45.102]  You need to do research into iodine and the iodine conspiracy for yourself.
[02:45:45.563 --> 02:45:47.364]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[02:45:47.784 --> 02:45:49.045]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[02:45:49.065 --> 02:45:51.866]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[02:45:52.326 --> 02:45:54.688]  I want like a 4.9 star on power reviews.
[02:45:55.288 --> 02:45:58.810]  But many of you hear me talk about this and it's just more background chatter.
[02:45:59.630 --> 02:46:02.072]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[02:46:03.132 --> 02:46:05.694]  Is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[02:46:05.914 --> 02:46:18.262]  So from our brain waves to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[02:46:18.763 --> 02:46:21.284]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[02:46:21.845 --> 02:46:22.985]  So iodine is amazing.
[02:46:23.025 --> 02:46:23.606]  It's important.
[02:46:23.626 --> 02:46:25.847]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[02:46:25.927 --> 02:46:26.448]  They'll hurt you.
[02:46:26.828 --> 02:46:27.508]  This is pure.
[02:46:27.789 --> 02:46:28.489]  This is clean.
[02:46:28.829 --> 02:46:29.610]  This is amazing.
[02:46:29.950 --> 02:46:31.731]  And it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[02:46:33.272 --> 02:46:36.914]  X2, our overall best-selling product, is now back.
[02:46:37.214 --> 02:46:41.977]  X2 original from the very first original manufacturer.
[02:46:42.377 --> 02:46:48.900]  The exact same X2 at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:48.960 --> 02:46:51.902]  As I said, get your pre-orders in, week, week and a half.
[02:46:52.182 --> 02:47:00.946]  It's being labeled right now, it's already been bottled, and we are going to have it for you, ladies and gentlemen, at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:47:00.986 --> 02:47:01.947]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:47:05.757 --> 02:47:08.618]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.460 --> 02:47:20.342]  And we're gonna ride.
[02:47:21.542 --> 02:47:23.183]  We're gonna ride.
[02:47:25.964 --> 02:47:31.106]  Ride like a one-eyed jack of diamonds with the devil close behind.
[02:47:31.226 --> 02:47:32.426]  We're gonna ride.
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:40.121]  I'm gonna find me a reckless woman.
[02:47:40.781 --> 02:47:43.042]  Humanity's been through a hell of a lot together.
[02:47:43.562 --> 02:47:44.522]  We're pretty damn cool.
[02:47:45.342 --> 02:47:46.323]  Here's to you, humanity.
[02:47:47.623 --> 02:47:53.325]  I'm gonna find me a reckless woman.
[02:47:53.485 --> 02:47:57.086]  Raise her blades and dice in her eyes.
[02:47:57.246 --> 02:47:58.626]  Nothing better than a reckless woman.
[02:47:59.907 --> 02:48:02.768]  Just a touch of sadness in her fingers.
[02:48:06.798 --> 02:48:12.901]  And that's the live version.
[02:48:12.921 --> 02:48:15.963]  It's a good song.
[02:48:16.363 --> 02:48:20.886]  You know, I got here today and I had all these clips and all this news and I basically covered none of it.
[02:48:21.366 --> 02:48:22.386]  I've covered the Mueller report.
[02:48:23.327 --> 02:48:25.768]  I've covered how they're going to strike back, why they're so arrogant.
[02:48:27.309 --> 02:48:30.331]  And just what a bunch of crap the globalists are.
[02:48:32.912 --> 02:48:34.413]  And I'm just going to say this to listeners.
[02:48:38.134 --> 02:48:59.353]  You know people tell me They say don't tell the globalists what's going on with you But see I don't get up here and lie So you imagine I don't plan any of this if I tried to lie to you what that would be like I can't lie to myself So I'll be honest with folks
[02:49:02.813 --> 02:49:04.134]  We plan to expand last year.
[02:49:04.154 --> 02:49:06.796]  They filed 20-something lawsuits on us.
[02:49:06.816 --> 02:49:10.098]  They've taken our sponsors, bank accounts, harassed the hell out of us.
[02:49:10.118 --> 02:49:22.106]  You've stood up for us and we're still here, but I think there's this idea because the Mueller report and because it looks like Trump's winning that, oh, well, we're doing good.
[02:49:22.126 --> 02:49:24.127]  No, we're in the middle of the war.
[02:49:25.828 --> 02:49:31.072]  And so, yeah, we're having some big victories, but I've just seen the audience just like when a Republican gets elected, even though they're traitors.
[02:49:31.092 --> 02:49:32.633]  A lot of times people just go to sleep.
[02:49:40.359 --> 02:49:42.881]  And you know, I actually pay our media people.
[02:49:43.141 --> 02:49:43.862]  And I pay them well.
[02:49:44.342 --> 02:49:46.223]  About twice what people are paid in Texas.
[02:49:47.384 --> 02:49:50.106]  But they pay people almost nothing for media jobs now.
[02:49:50.126 --> 02:49:56.271]  And people on Discovery Channel, History Channel are like, well, I used to make big movies 20 years ago, but now I work for free, hoping I get a credit on this movie.
[02:49:57.792 --> 02:49:58.973]  Hollywood's a joke, folks.
[02:49:59.153 --> 02:50:01.855]  Netflix and a thousand shows a year, all of it's crap.
[02:50:02.853 --> 02:50:06.895]  So I get there's a glut of media, but this is a place to spend your money.
[02:50:07.736 --> 02:50:08.876]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:50:09.897 --> 02:50:12.618]  Great books, great films, great t-shirts, great supplements.
[02:50:13.519 --> 02:50:21.483]  And if you just go there, if you just buy it, you're funding the second American revolution and you're standing in defiance of Soros and Hillary and all these losers.
[02:50:22.584 --> 02:50:26.046]  Because here's the thing, we've pretty much beat this wave of the enemy, but more waves are coming.
[02:50:28.925 --> 02:50:30.967]  And I want to be here to face those future waves.
[02:50:31.027 --> 02:50:34.211]  Someday, I won't be able to do that, but I am in your hands.
[02:50:34.871 --> 02:50:36.833]  And when I say that, it's not hyperbole.
[02:50:39.676 --> 02:50:45.122]  And at a sick level, it's almost like... I've already fought a couple wars.
[02:50:46.043 --> 02:50:46.703]  You know, I could...
[02:50:49.088 --> 02:50:50.169]  Eject out of here.
[02:50:51.470 --> 02:50:56.053]  But... I passed that point a long time ago.
[02:50:57.053 --> 02:50:57.934]  I can't stop now.
[02:51:00.216 --> 02:51:03.598]  And so... I'm in God's hands.
[02:51:06.220 --> 02:51:07.300]  And God works through you.
[02:51:12.644 --> 02:51:15.206]  And so I can sit here and ask you to financially support us.
[02:51:20.117 --> 02:51:22.840]  But at the end of the day, we all really know that isn't what matters.
[02:51:24.262 --> 02:51:25.283]  It doesn't really matter, does it?
[02:51:27.787 --> 02:51:30.089]  What matters is the decision you make about your soul.
[02:51:33.754 --> 02:51:38.520]  And if your soul is pointed at God, you're going to make the right decision regardless.
[02:51:40.319 --> 02:51:42.481]  But I know so many people watch and listen.
[02:51:43.021 --> 02:51:47.304]  Despite the censorship, new numbers are, which I don't even really want to announce.
[02:51:47.765 --> 02:51:50.807]  Smart people I listen to go, Alex Jones, don't, don't, don't, don't announce this.
[02:51:57.532 --> 02:51:57.952]  I can't help it.
[02:51:57.972 --> 02:51:58.352]  I'm going to do it.
[02:51:59.914 --> 02:52:04.337]  We're reaching more people than we ever have on third party sites.
[02:52:08.394 --> 02:52:11.236]  And it's not on the few little outposts we have.
[02:52:12.437 --> 02:52:14.159]  It's through the public taking actions.
[02:52:14.179 --> 02:52:14.659]  That's beautiful.
[02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:23.406]  The byproduct is that they're not the type of listeners that buy stuff.
[02:52:24.407 --> 02:52:29.271]  So we're winning the ethereal war of minds like never before.
[02:52:31.133 --> 02:52:33.795]  It's like Super Mario Brothers when you get the mushroom and you're like invincible.
[02:52:34.115 --> 02:52:34.816]  We're at that point.
[02:52:37.691 --> 02:52:39.432]  Back at the real world home base.
[02:52:40.292 --> 02:52:41.073]  Feast or famine.
[02:52:41.293 --> 02:52:42.674]  Best of times, worst of times.
[02:52:43.254 --> 02:52:43.994]  Tale of Two Cities.
[02:52:46.336 --> 02:52:47.877]  Financially, we're not doing well.
[02:52:50.818 --> 02:52:53.700]  So put it on your calendar, mark it down on your ledger, however you do it.
[02:52:54.100 --> 02:52:55.721]  Sign up for AutoShip, whatever you do.
[02:52:56.161 --> 02:52:57.122]  We got stuff you need.
[02:52:58.211 --> 02:52:59.431]  And Lord, I'm not judging you.
[02:52:59.451 --> 02:53:02.893]  I know I go to box stores myself when I'm busy or whatever.
[02:53:03.153 --> 02:53:03.833]  I'm not blaming you.
[02:53:04.373 --> 02:53:07.834]  I stay in establishment hotels if I'm busy and don't have time to find my mom and pop.
[02:53:09.015 --> 02:53:10.295]  Hell, Airbnb's banned us.
[02:53:10.315 --> 02:53:11.436]  I haven't even made that announcement yet.
[02:53:11.456 --> 02:53:13.236]  I try to stay in people's houses.
[02:53:16.958 --> 02:53:18.638]  But we need your financial support.
[02:53:19.819 --> 02:53:23.360]  We just need folks to make that commitment and realize they're changing the world.
[02:53:23.400 --> 02:53:25.841]  A lot of you have done it, a lot of you haven't, and I appreciate you.
[02:53:29.432 --> 02:53:30.712]  Alright, who's been on the longest here?
[02:53:31.512 --> 02:53:36.593]  Marcos in Texas, or is it... Oh my God, it's Gary in Virginia.
[02:53:36.653 --> 02:53:38.234]  Gary in Virginia, come on down.
[02:53:38.634 --> 02:53:39.754]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:53:41.574 --> 02:53:42.794]  How you doing, Mr. Jones?
[02:53:43.614 --> 02:53:45.455]  I'm happier than a pig in manure, brother.
[02:53:46.855 --> 02:53:49.956]  Yeah, that's one of my sayings, too.
[02:53:50.016 --> 02:53:58.057]  Look, I'm a first-time caller, but I haven't known about y'all for probably seven or eight years.
[02:53:58.925 --> 02:54:04.408]  But this thing we're all talking about deep down in you, you know that you know all this is happening.
[02:54:04.468 --> 02:54:05.329]  I've known for.
[02:54:06.169 --> 02:54:10.492]  You know, actually, ever since I've been a little boy that this day is coming and.
[02:54:11.753 --> 02:54:14.935]  And where I see we're at today is.
[02:54:16.736 --> 02:54:21.859]  Like, you know, InfoWars is out there fighting and they're and they're doing what they're supposed to do.
[02:54:22.019 --> 02:54:25.221]  And yes, they they are winning the information war.
[02:54:26.454 --> 02:54:31.917]  And, uh, but what I see is, which is great, but because you need to wake the people up.
[02:54:32.497 --> 02:54:37.220]  But on my opinion, what I see is this is exactly what they want anyway.
[02:54:38.521 --> 02:54:52.809]  I mean, the more that, uh, it could get turned out here and more that their calls can be, you know, released to the people to where the people get used to hearing that on every day.
[02:54:55.239 --> 02:54:58.161]  I totally agree with you.
[02:54:58.241 --> 02:54:59.121]  It's a paradox.
[02:55:00.302 --> 02:55:04.445]  Because we expose globalism, but by exposing it, people just get used to globalism.
[02:55:04.645 --> 02:55:05.245]  I agree with you.
[02:55:05.605 --> 02:55:07.106]  So how do you deal with that paradox?
[02:55:08.847 --> 02:55:17.133]  Well, you know, I'm a mechanic by trade, and I only know right and wrong.
[02:55:18.228 --> 02:55:24.650]  You know, if you're going by the well, we're all going by this so called globalist schedule right now.
[02:55:25.310 --> 02:55:30.032]  So you said a mechanic is like a mechanical mathematician.
[02:55:30.472 --> 02:55:32.373]  If the stuff doesn't line up, it doesn't work.
[02:55:32.453 --> 02:55:33.553]  So what do you think we did?
[02:55:35.494 --> 02:55:40.816]  I think what the other caller said, we should we should do that immediately.
[02:55:41.036 --> 02:55:47.098]  And and I think that as far as another special counsel,
[02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:48.201]  It's concerning.
[02:56:02.901 --> 02:56:05.402]  Just going straight down in because you got the evidence.
[02:56:05.502 --> 02:56:06.122]  No, exactly.
[02:56:06.182 --> 02:56:08.723]  This has been used to cover up the illegal spying.
[02:56:09.223 --> 02:56:10.564]  The Mueller report is a cover-up.
[02:56:10.984 --> 02:56:13.205]  Trump saying it's a victory, now he gets it isn't.
[02:56:13.725 --> 02:56:16.806]  Now it's a blueprint for Congress to go after obstruction.
[02:56:17.306 --> 02:56:17.527]  No.
[02:56:18.207 --> 02:56:23.109]  Mueller, Comey, McCabe, Rosenstein, they all committed crimes publicly.
[02:56:23.509 --> 02:56:24.909]  Stop being on the defense.
[02:56:25.109 --> 02:56:26.050]  Offense now!
[02:56:27.370 --> 02:56:29.391]  This is what I don't understand.
[02:56:29.411 --> 02:56:30.652]  Now, I voted for Trump.
[02:56:30.932 --> 02:56:31.772]  And I love Trump.
[02:56:32.726 --> 02:56:35.748]  And I mean, and I watch every move.
[02:56:35.768 --> 02:56:38.269]  I've been watching all these moves for as long as you have.
[02:56:39.110 --> 02:56:42.252]  And I live, eat, and sleep this every day.
[02:56:42.332 --> 02:56:43.473]  I've lost friends over it.
[02:56:43.493 --> 02:56:45.434]  They think I'm crazy, you know?
[02:56:45.634 --> 02:56:47.755]  Oh yeah, being informed is crazy nowadays.
[02:56:48.796 --> 02:56:56.700]  I know, but what I'm getting at is these people that are in power.
[02:56:57.381 --> 02:57:01.083]  See, Trump, to me, Trump, this is one thing that bothered me that Trump
[02:57:01.798 --> 02:57:05.399]  I don't know what's going on in the next office to me.
[02:57:05.559 --> 02:57:07.779]  People are loyal, or they get the mission, or they don't.
[02:57:29.850 --> 02:57:31.131]  Trump got pissed at Sessions.
[02:57:31.231 --> 02:57:35.515]  It's like... So, look, Trump is not God, okay?
[02:57:36.296 --> 02:57:37.898]  And it's up to us to keep pushing.
[02:57:37.918 --> 02:57:41.901]  But Sessions is a weak, broken, compromised person.
[02:57:43.483 --> 02:57:47.166]  And there's a new sheriff in town because Trump caught him by the short hairs.
[02:57:48.067 --> 02:57:49.589]  We need to exercise power now.
[02:57:52.231 --> 02:57:52.752]  If you're not...
[02:57:54.019 --> 02:58:02.926]  Let me just tell listeners about something that is the very best product for your telomeres, for your mitochondrial DNA, that's the antioxidant that's next level.
[02:58:03.107 --> 02:58:11.914]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, the amount of it in here, depending on the equation, something like 40 boxes of the same chemical that's naturally occurring in blueberries.
[02:58:12.094 --> 02:58:12.815]  It's ridiculous.
[02:58:12.935 --> 02:58:13.375]  The CoQ10, PPQ,
[02:58:14.616 --> 02:58:17.877]  We have the organically derived, and by that, it's not synthetic.
[02:58:18.137 --> 02:58:23.579]  Most of the stuff that you see on the shelves, a tiny bottle of PQQ or CoQ10, will be like 50 bucks, because even the synthetic is expensive.
[02:58:23.639 --> 02:58:25.740]  This is the organically derived.
[02:58:26.160 --> 02:58:27.060]  This is the real stuff.
[02:58:27.240 --> 02:58:27.941]  I want to warn you, though.
[02:58:28.201 --> 02:58:37.124]  When I first started taking it five years ago, and this is DNA Force Plus, when I cut my finger off, like, 15 years ago, they reattached the finger, and you can see that right there, where it cut off.
[02:58:37.344 --> 02:58:38.744]  It was hanging by a piece of skin right here.
[02:58:38.844 --> 02:58:40.385]  It doesn't cut cleanly like you see in the movies.
[02:58:41.005 --> 02:58:42.066]  And then tore it off.
[02:58:42.106 --> 02:58:43.567]  It was numb all the way up here.
[02:58:43.687 --> 02:58:45.849]  And the strangest thing is I started taking DNA force.
[02:58:46.049 --> 02:58:47.590]  The feeling came back in my finger.
[02:58:47.650 --> 02:58:49.131]  First it tingled, and it came back.
[02:58:49.331 --> 02:58:50.412]  I was like, this is incredible.
[02:58:50.472 --> 02:58:51.292]  But I'm going to warn you.
[02:58:51.493 --> 02:58:56.036]  Most people that have old injuries and where nerves have kind of died out, this isn't just regenerating your shells.
[02:58:56.196 --> 02:58:59.979]  This isn't just slowing the shrinkage of telomeres, which is the same thing as making them last longer.
[02:59:00.179 --> 02:59:02.480]  It really does regenerate nerves in many areas.
[02:59:02.720 --> 02:59:04.542]  So it's the building blocks.
[02:59:04.782 --> 02:59:05.703]  And it's the next level.
[02:59:05.743 --> 02:59:06.663]  It's the best you're going to get.
[02:59:06.803 --> 02:59:09.545]  I remember saying, what's the top selling thing like six years ago?
[02:59:09.605 --> 02:59:10.366]  We're getting into supplements.
[02:59:10.606 --> 02:59:12.448]  And well, it's PQQ and CoQ10.
[02:59:12.588 --> 02:59:17.794]  But mainly people at grocery stores don't want to pay that, so they buy synthetic stuff that's still 50, 60 bucks for a little bottle.
[02:59:17.974 --> 02:59:22.520]  But at medical clinics, it's not prescription, but people are willing to pay, you know, 300, 400 bucks.
[02:59:22.840 --> 02:59:24.502]  That's a six, seven times markup.
[02:59:25.523 --> 02:59:26.303]  We're good to go.
[02:59:54.266 --> 02:59:58.387]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:58.887 --> 03:00:00.228]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:06.770 --> 03:00:15.893]  You know, there's such treason going on.
[03:00:17.993 --> 03:00:22.455]  And our government's so overrun with traitors that I just don't have words anymore.
[03:00:24.164 --> 03:00:28.306]  Thousands of illegal aliens were stopped in New Mexico in the last three days.
[03:00:29.586 --> 03:00:30.527]  350 at a time.
[03:00:31.827 --> 03:00:32.907]  AP even reports.
[03:00:33.388 --> 03:00:34.648]  The reports have been up since yesterday.
[03:00:34.688 --> 03:00:35.829]  I could have led the show with it.
[03:00:38.149 --> 03:00:40.290]  And these are all military-age men.
[03:00:40.390 --> 03:00:44.132]  Every 15 men or so have a kid they hold up, like, let us in.
[03:00:45.632 --> 03:00:46.893]  And now the New Mexico
[03:00:49.790 --> 03:00:57.052]  Government attacked Citizen Border Patrol after 1,800 illegals crossed the 24 hours and citizens detained them.
[03:00:58.273 --> 03:01:01.394]  But they were already just waiting to be picked up by Border Patrol and taken into the U.S.
[03:01:01.954 --> 03:01:03.134]  Because everything's overwhelmed.
[03:01:03.174 --> 03:01:03.975]  The courts, everything.
[03:01:05.055 --> 03:01:07.136]  And then, it's a Kellan McBrain article.
[03:01:08.256 --> 03:01:09.556]  They act like they're the traitors.
[03:01:12.037 --> 03:01:12.757]  God Almighty.
[03:01:14.638 --> 03:01:16.459]  You know, I've been down to Central and South America.
[03:01:16.479 --> 03:01:17.259]  It's scary as hell.
[03:01:20.114 --> 03:01:24.455]  And, uh, you know, Trump tried to get the beds increased from $90,000 to $200,000.
[03:01:27.156 --> 03:01:28.856]  He tried to get $12 billion for a wall.
[03:01:28.896 --> 03:01:30.136]  They gave him $1.3 billion.
[03:01:30.156 --> 03:01:31.757]  Because the U.N.'
[03:01:31.737 --> 03:01:33.097]  's financing this whole takedown.
[03:01:35.218 --> 03:01:39.819]  And then Ann Coulter talks about Trump not being tough on the border.
[03:01:40.139 --> 03:01:41.359]  I'm not defending Trump.
[03:01:41.679 --> 03:01:42.760]  It's the Democrats.
[03:01:43.220 --> 03:01:44.220]  It's the globalists.
[03:01:45.691 --> 03:01:47.692]  That have advertised the fall of our country.
[03:01:48.172 --> 03:01:49.752]  So put the target where it is.
[03:01:49.792 --> 03:01:50.993]  But see, Ann Coulter knows.
[03:01:52.833 --> 03:01:54.374]  If she talks a bunch of trash about the president.
[03:01:57.055 --> 03:01:58.075]  Google won't block her.
[03:01:59.736 --> 03:02:01.096]  I'm not even against Ann Coulter.
[03:02:01.116 --> 03:02:02.556]  I just don't get it.
[03:02:06.838 --> 03:02:07.878]  I just don't get it anymore.
[03:02:11.799 --> 03:02:13.400]  Yesterday I meant to lead the show with the
[03:02:15.074 --> 03:02:17.456]  Citizen militia arresting thousands of illegal aliens.
[03:02:18.037 --> 03:02:22.681]  Didn't do it today, because there's so many other big things going on, but that's just crazy.
[03:02:24.363 --> 03:02:26.345]  That's so crazy.
[03:02:28.667 --> 03:02:32.511]  Mexico has the tightest immigration laws in the Western Hemisphere.
[03:02:35.407 --> 03:02:37.428]  And these aren't Mexicans being brought in here, folks.
[03:02:38.769 --> 03:02:42.010]  They're all men with kids they've kidnapped in many cases.
[03:02:43.411 --> 03:02:46.112]  That they're bringing in to get that golden ticket, all that free stuff.
[03:02:47.433 --> 03:02:50.394]  So the Democrats can sign them up to vote us into oblivion.
[03:02:51.795 --> 03:02:58.398]  You know, if we had a bunch of brown people who love the Second Amendment and private property, and we could indoctrinate, I'd say, yeah, we need more people.
[03:02:58.418 --> 03:03:01.620]  But no, 90 plus percent are going to vote Democrat next year.
[03:03:04.394 --> 03:03:06.015]  Because they come from socialist hellholes.
[03:03:06.455 --> 03:03:07.255]  They do what they're told.
[03:03:08.095 --> 03:03:10.096]  And the group that brings them in is who they're going to follow.
[03:03:14.197 --> 03:03:19.559]  And then our own media looks at 1,000 plus people.
[03:03:20.099 --> 03:03:20.960]  1,800 people.
[03:03:23.661 --> 03:03:25.901]  Everyone's like, how'd the militia subdue them?
[03:03:26.642 --> 03:03:27.502]  It's citizen arrest!
[03:03:29.338 --> 03:03:31.199]  You got 300, 400 people at a time.
[03:03:31.459 --> 03:03:33.499]  They all just go, oh, we made it across.
[03:03:34.099 --> 03:03:38.801]  Amnesty, amnesty, free, free stuff, free goodies.
[03:03:39.561 --> 03:03:40.381]  We're here for the freebies.
[03:03:45.822 --> 03:03:49.003]  I remember my grandfather and my grandmother living in South Austin.
[03:03:49.043 --> 03:03:55.365]  They decided to live in a more frugal home so they could give more money to churches and charities.
[03:03:56.698 --> 03:04:04.445]  When they died, we learned they'd given huge sums from West Texas oil fields and inheritances to churches.
[03:04:05.346 --> 03:04:10.190]  That's why my grandfather, like 78 years old, got audited by the IRS.
[03:04:10.250 --> 03:04:11.471]  And they said, you owe all this money.
[03:04:11.491 --> 03:04:12.372]  You haven't paid this money.
[03:04:13.352 --> 03:04:16.155]  And the fact that he was such a Puritan, he got so hurt by that.
[03:04:17.416 --> 03:04:19.458]  He had a heart attack and then became brain damaged.
[03:04:24.198 --> 03:04:38.123]  I just sit back and I think about that and the lawlessness of the system to bring in 100,000 people we know of a month, hundreds of thousands we don't, a total rush at our border.
[03:04:38.463 --> 03:04:40.084]  Head of the Border Patrol says the border's failed.
[03:04:41.764 --> 03:04:43.485]  And we're all just supposed to pay for it all.
[03:04:44.545 --> 03:04:48.707]  But if old people don't pay their income taxes, they lose their house.
[03:04:50.083 --> 03:04:53.665]  But we gotta be nice and give all these people freebies.
[03:04:55.146 --> 03:04:58.929]  The lowest IQ of Latin America being brought here.
[03:05:00.010 --> 03:05:00.690]  What a mess.
[03:05:05.854 --> 03:05:07.255]  Please don't forget, we have...
[03:05:09.122 --> 03:05:11.184]  A lot of amazing deals on the site.
[03:05:11.204 --> 03:05:12.665]  We still have store-wide free shipping.
[03:05:12.885 --> 03:05:15.247]  We had to end all those big discounts on the supplements.
[03:05:15.267 --> 03:05:21.152]  We're about to sell out of all of them, but we still have a big discount going, even though it's about to sell out on DNA Force, our flagship, amazing product.

[03:06:56.769 --> 03:06:57.469]  Getting took.
[03:06:58.790 --> 03:07:02.091]  I'm here to tell you, it's harder than it looks.
[03:07:02.731 --> 03:07:08.374]  I'm here to tell you, it's harder than it looks.
[03:07:09.774 --> 03:07:16.257]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls.
[03:07:16.277 --> 03:07:18.438]  I've got a special report coming up.
[03:07:18.458 --> 03:07:22.540]  You know, I said I'd do vaccines, but I just don't know if I'd do it justice.
[03:07:23.871 --> 03:07:28.214]  Just kind of adding as an addendum here, but I always try to deliver on what I say I'll do.
[03:07:28.974 --> 03:07:31.476]  We're going to bam, bam, bam through your calls right now.
[03:07:31.976 --> 03:07:38.120]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[03:07:38.140 --> 03:07:40.622]  Good to talk to you.
[03:07:40.962 --> 03:07:45.545]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[03:07:45.765 --> 03:07:47.526]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[03:07:47.607 --> 03:07:52.630]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic roots, things like that, that I trust.
[03:07:53.226 --> 03:07:57.448]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have the things that they say that they have in them.
[03:07:57.868 --> 03:07:59.229]  And they're often not things that are natural.
[03:07:59.829 --> 03:08:00.510]  I appreciate that.
[03:08:00.530 --> 03:08:02.271]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[03:08:02.311 --> 03:08:02.831]  Tell us about it.
[03:08:03.791 --> 03:08:04.532]  Well, it's really great.
[03:08:04.552 --> 03:08:06.193]  You know, it's like a multivitamin, I take it.
[03:08:06.213 --> 03:08:06.933]  It tastes good.
[03:08:06.993 --> 03:08:08.654]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[03:08:08.734 --> 03:08:10.415]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[03:08:10.995 --> 03:08:13.916]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[03:08:13.936 --> 03:08:14.697]  So I really like it.
[03:08:15.421 --> 03:08:18.064]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[03:08:18.104 --> 03:08:19.686]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[03:08:20.286 --> 03:08:22.168]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[03:08:22.269 --> 03:08:26.914]  So yeah, Ultimate Female Force has a 100% review on Power Reviews.
[03:08:27.414 --> 03:08:30.558]  No other product actually has that, but it's only got a few reviews.
[03:08:31.399 --> 03:08:33.961]  100% review, a perfect five star.
[03:08:34.802 --> 03:08:40.043]  And like Leanne McAdoo, before she went home to take care of her grandmother and stuff, she's still a great reporter for us.
[03:08:40.704 --> 03:08:44.405]  She took Ultimate Female Force and was just like, this is insane.
[03:08:44.905 --> 03:08:46.765]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[03:08:47.225 --> 03:08:49.546]  These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force.
[03:08:49.906 --> 03:08:50.846]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[03:08:51.486 --> 03:08:53.867]  What's your view, Stacey, from Texas on the Mueller Report?
[03:08:54.741 --> 03:09:06.808]  Well here's the thing, so I actually, like I used to be considered, I considered myself a Democrat until the Mueller Report incident came out, because I've seen that the Democrats don't want the truth, they want to set a trap.
[03:09:07.268 --> 03:09:07.889]  And that's it.
[03:09:08.309 --> 03:09:10.010]  It's not about finding the truth at all for them.
[03:09:11.766 --> 03:09:12.347]  Well that's it.
[03:09:12.587 --> 03:09:21.955]  And instead of like always, oh they're in authority and we're not Russian agents, how about you took money from Uranium One, you took money from the shy comms, go on the offense.
[03:09:22.275 --> 03:09:25.078]  Trump's got to know he has nothing to lose, man.
[03:09:25.158 --> 03:09:27.040]  I'm sick of bowing to these people.
[03:09:27.700 --> 03:09:33.125]  Weird-ass Nadler and Schiff and Pelosi and AOC.
[03:09:33.185 --> 03:09:35.988]  It's like I'm gonna be ruled by a bunch of retards.
[03:09:37.330 --> 03:09:37.910]  Exactly.
[03:09:38.431 --> 03:09:45.675]  You know, it's really crazy because as things come out, as we find out these new things, they're attaching to the smallest things that they can.
[03:09:45.695 --> 03:09:52.279]  They're getting really desperate and it's really showing a lot of Democrats and I think that we're going to get a lot more people coming on to the Republican side because of that.
[03:09:52.339 --> 03:09:53.320]  Just like it happened for me.
[03:09:54.821 --> 03:09:56.682]  So you were a Democrat and it woke you up?
[03:09:57.502 --> 03:09:57.983]  Absolutely.
[03:09:58.023 --> 03:09:59.163]  Red-tailed by the Mueller Report.
[03:09:59.804 --> 03:10:01.024]  By the way, I don't blame you.
[03:10:01.144 --> 03:10:03.186]  The old blue-blood Republican Party was horrible.
[03:10:04.011 --> 03:10:06.113]  I mean, 20 years ago, I didn't know which party I liked.
[03:10:06.173 --> 03:10:06.973]  I was a Libertarian.
[03:10:07.433 --> 03:10:11.756]  But now, I mean, the Democrats are like, how would you describe them?
[03:10:11.836 --> 03:10:12.737]  What would you call them?
[03:10:12.777 --> 03:10:17.080]  Just a normal person, if you were just from another planet visiting.
[03:10:18.041 --> 03:10:22.024]  OK, I feel like I'm already like another planet visiting because it is a crazy world, right?
[03:10:22.084 --> 03:10:25.226]  So, you know, I think
[03:10:26.283 --> 03:10:27.364]  Oh God, I forgot the question.
[03:10:27.404 --> 03:10:28.404]  I'm so nervous talking to you.
[03:10:28.424 --> 03:10:30.245]  No, I mean, what would you, who are the Democrats?
[03:10:30.325 --> 03:10:31.666]  I mean... Absolutely, okay.
[03:10:31.686 --> 03:10:34.467]  So the Democrats, you know, when I first became a Democrat, I was in high school.
[03:10:34.487 --> 03:10:39.870]  I had to, you know, pick what I wanted to be for, you know, if I wanted to vote when I was 18 years old.
[03:10:40.290 --> 03:10:44.853]  So I chose Democrat because I had this idea that I love helping people.
[03:10:44.873 --> 03:10:47.414]  I want there to be social programs, things like that.
[03:10:47.434 --> 03:10:47.974]  Exactly.
[03:10:47.994 --> 03:10:50.676]  They advertise that they want to help people.
[03:10:51.363 --> 03:10:53.045]  Yes, and so that's why I became Democrat.
[03:10:53.065 --> 03:10:56.628]  But, you know, as I'm seeing, I'm seeing a lot more hatred on that side.
[03:10:56.648 --> 03:11:01.892]  When I went to college, I went to a university, I started to see things that I never expected.
[03:11:01.913 --> 03:11:11.281]  I just graduated recently, so I saw a lot of, you know, a lot of victim culture there that I, you know, I don't identify with at all because I came from a background.
[03:11:11.581 --> 03:11:12.882]  My mother is from Mexico.
[03:11:13.243 --> 03:11:14.244]  She worked so hard.
[03:11:14.264 --> 03:11:15.104]  She came from dirt poor.
[03:11:16.263 --> 03:11:17.183]  She's giving me everything.
[03:11:17.203 --> 03:11:19.064]  You know, I'm standing on this children's giant here.
[03:11:19.484 --> 03:11:21.865]  So, I mean, I don't have any sympathy for that.
[03:11:21.925 --> 03:11:24.426]  So your mother came here legally and now she's successful?
[03:11:24.766 --> 03:11:24.986]  Yes.
[03:11:25.346 --> 03:11:27.107]  She came here legally when she was three years old.
[03:11:27.567 --> 03:11:28.647]  She is Republican.
[03:11:28.687 --> 03:11:42.852]  She believes that every Mexican that comes into this country should come here legally because she has worked so hard and she knows that she had the same opportunities as all of her brothers and sisters and she's come so far and they, you know, they didn't take advantage of those same opportunities.
[03:11:44.963 --> 03:11:46.044]  Well, God bless your mother.
[03:11:46.104 --> 03:11:47.004]  Thank you so much, Stacey.
[03:11:47.024 --> 03:11:47.605]  That's beautiful.
[03:11:48.805 --> 03:11:49.686]  That's a beautiful call.
[03:11:49.886 --> 03:11:51.087]  Gosh, amazing call.
[03:11:52.167 --> 03:11:53.528]  Let's just try to go to more here.
[03:11:54.489 --> 03:11:57.631]  We have an unlimited phone bank, so I just always have to hang up on somebody.
[03:11:57.671 --> 03:12:00.833]  But let's go to Debbie in New Jersey.
[03:12:00.893 --> 03:12:01.833]  Another lady calling in.
[03:12:01.873 --> 03:12:02.494]  Debbie, welcome.
[03:12:02.514 --> 03:12:02.874]  Thank you.
[03:12:03.814 --> 03:12:04.775]  Hey, Alex.
[03:12:04.835 --> 03:12:10.679]  I just wanted to tell you that we did try to buy that new textbook that you have, and it was out of stock.
[03:12:11.892 --> 03:12:13.633]  You know, that's my frustration.
[03:12:13.994 --> 03:12:17.856]  We buy 500 books, and then whatever's hot sells right out, and we never reorder it.
[03:12:17.876 --> 03:12:19.298]  But thanks for trying to support us.
[03:12:20.639 --> 03:12:22.780]  Yeah, no, we try to get everything we can.
[03:12:23.240 --> 03:12:34.089]  But on the tax subject, before I go into anything else, is we are trying to educate people about OIDs and A4Bs, and I have done this with the IRS.
[03:12:34.809 --> 03:12:36.590]  And they were less than pleased.
[03:12:36.991 --> 03:12:37.791]  And I own a house.
[03:12:39.167 --> 03:12:42.548]  I'm putting myself out on the line, too, because my thing is screw you.
[03:12:44.789 --> 03:12:46.630]  That's what we got to do when we're getting overrun.
[03:12:46.670 --> 03:12:49.371]  What do you make of Trump and what he needs to do?
[03:12:49.451 --> 03:12:53.572]  I mean, the Democrats are doubling down now to come after the country.
[03:12:53.632 --> 03:12:54.693]  We've got to stop this.
[03:12:54.753 --> 03:12:56.153]  I mean, I don't want a war.
[03:12:56.233 --> 03:12:57.094]  They started a war.
[03:12:58.274 --> 03:12:59.695]  I've been saying this all along.
[03:13:00.195 --> 03:13:00.995]  I'm tired of it.
[03:13:01.475 --> 03:13:03.296]  I know a lot of other people are tired of it.
[03:13:04.378 --> 03:13:05.999]  We all have Trump's back.
[03:13:06.079 --> 03:13:07.160]  He wants to go to war.
[03:13:07.220 --> 03:13:07.920]  Let's go.
[03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:09.561]  Let's take care of business.
[03:13:10.261 --> 03:13:15.024]  First thing I tell everybody is, everybody with an oath and bond, lean it.
[03:13:15.064 --> 03:13:16.124]  You'll bankrupt them.
[03:13:16.465 --> 03:13:18.326]  If he doesn't do that, he's crazy.
[03:13:18.746 --> 03:13:20.047]  That's the best way to hit them.
[03:13:20.067 --> 03:13:21.307]  Well, the military's awake.
[03:13:21.367 --> 03:13:22.428]  Law enforcement's awake.
[03:13:22.868 --> 03:13:25.289]  The average working person's awake of every race, color, and creed.
[03:13:25.630 --> 03:13:27.751]  Trump has double the numbers of Hispanics and blacks.
[03:13:28.371 --> 03:13:32.532]  And we've got a rogue government signed on with the CHICOMS trying to create a civil war.
[03:13:33.373 --> 03:13:35.253]  It's his duty to stop these people.
[03:13:35.673 --> 03:13:37.194]  My question is, what do you do?
[03:13:37.294 --> 03:13:37.994]  They're lawless.
[03:13:38.394 --> 03:13:39.255]  They're attacking.
[03:13:39.575 --> 03:13:40.915]  They're trying to arrest everybody.
[03:13:40.995 --> 03:13:41.455]  What do we do?
[03:13:42.856 --> 03:13:44.256]  Tell him just put the word out there.
[03:13:44.316 --> 03:13:48.738]  Get on TV, radio, whatever he's got to do.
[03:13:49.018 --> 03:13:49.538]  We're ready.
[03:13:50.511 --> 03:13:52.632]  No, no, I know that, but I mean, let me tell you something.
[03:13:52.652 --> 03:13:53.872]  The help angels have his back.
[03:13:54.072 --> 03:14:04.236]  No, I understand, but I mean, coordinating local people doing things is a... I'm saying, what do we legally do when we've got the Democrats trying to overthrow the country?
[03:14:04.256 --> 03:14:10.398]  I think the President has to call them out, and I think he has to get grand juries to start indicting them, because... Oh, absolutely.
[03:14:11.598 --> 03:14:12.038]  Absolutely.
[03:14:12.098 --> 03:14:13.398]  I've said that from day one, too.
[03:14:13.459 --> 03:14:14.279]  Indict them already.
[03:14:14.439 --> 03:14:15.399]  What are you waiting for?
[03:14:15.419 --> 03:14:17.060]  I appreciate your call.
[03:14:17.100 --> 03:14:17.800]  Thank you so much, Debbie.
[03:14:19.087 --> 03:14:19.868]  You know, here's the thing.
[03:14:20.308 --> 03:14:22.290]  I'm not in a piss-in contest with the Democrats.
[03:14:23.411 --> 03:14:25.233]  I don't want to see them swinging from the end of a rope.
[03:14:25.814 --> 03:14:27.435]  They won't stop.
[03:14:29.717 --> 03:14:35.203]  They're allied with the EU, the Cheikoms, with Cuba, with Venezuela.
[03:14:35.983 --> 03:14:38.166]  They give speeches and say America sucks.
[03:14:39.295 --> 03:14:49.440]  They give speeches that say, in people's free speech, Congressman Senator Murphy says, banning Alex Jones is critical to saving America.
[03:14:53.702 --> 03:14:55.423]  I've experienced these people.
[03:14:57.144 --> 03:14:58.685]  And I've experienced their lives.
[03:15:00.285 --> 03:15:02.426]  And at a certain point, man, we gotta fight back.
[03:15:03.727 --> 03:15:05.468]  Because our acquiescence to them
[03:15:07.219 --> 03:15:14.341]  Has Greene let them funding the Arab Spring to overthrow our allies and put radical Islam in charge?
[03:15:15.141 --> 03:15:18.542]  And then it's in the Soros documents to overthrow Israel?
[03:15:18.562 --> 03:15:21.143]  Man, it's not like I'm in a love fest with Israel.
[03:15:21.183 --> 03:15:22.283]  I don't say that apologetically.
[03:15:22.323 --> 03:15:23.163]  I'm not against Israel.
[03:15:25.344 --> 03:15:27.505]  Our government wants to overthrow Israel?
[03:15:27.525 --> 03:15:29.045]  That'll cause a nuclear war!
[03:15:29.645 --> 03:15:31.086]  Israel's not going anywhere!
[03:15:31.106 --> 03:15:33.386]  It's like saying you want a war with Russia!
[03:15:33.406 --> 03:15:35.827]  This is not gonna happen!
[03:15:37.563 --> 03:15:38.003]  It's crazy.
[03:15:38.123 --> 03:15:39.744]  You know, I said I'd play this Kim Trill video.
[03:15:39.784 --> 03:15:43.744]  I said I'd do this, uh... I said I'd do this whole vaccine video.
[03:15:43.784 --> 03:15:44.445]  It was so important.
[03:15:45.385 --> 03:15:48.166]  But I think more calls are what's needed, and then Papert's taking over.
[03:15:48.986 --> 03:15:49.906]  But, uh, we'll see.
[03:15:50.786 --> 03:15:54.047]  Maybe I should come back tomorrow and do a special Saturday show.
[03:15:54.927 --> 03:15:58.308]  Because these topics that I haven't hit are paramount.
[03:15:58.928 --> 03:15:59.348]  Stay with us.
[03:16:02.229 --> 03:16:06.690]  Most of you know... I want to put forward an allegory.
[03:16:07.870 --> 03:16:14.312]  Or a story to explain where I'm coming from that parallels current real-time reality.
[03:16:14.772 --> 03:16:17.293]  So please, bear with me a few minutes.
[03:16:18.753 --> 03:16:24.535]  Because this is just bubbling up from my own thought processes of why am I sitting here with my shirt off.
[03:16:25.375 --> 03:16:27.416]  I want to be crystal clear with everybody.
[03:16:29.156 --> 03:16:35.518]  What I'm about to say is not about putting down California like we're different football teams.
[03:16:36.949 --> 03:16:40.252]  And we're talking about the University of Texas versus UCLA.
[03:16:41.513 --> 03:16:45.836]  This is not... Alex Jones is a tribalist going, woo!
[03:16:46.276 --> 03:16:48.058]  Texas is way better than California.
[03:16:48.278 --> 03:16:49.039]  F-California.
[03:16:50.480 --> 03:16:54.883]  California, until about 30 years ago, was undoubtedly the best state in the Union.
[03:16:56.084 --> 03:17:00.548]  It was more Texan than Texans because it was the last big frontier state.
[03:17:01.188 --> 03:17:02.729]  The 49ers, all of it.
[03:17:02.789 --> 03:17:05.952]  I mean, the history books I've read about it have been incredible.
[03:17:07.364 --> 03:17:11.605]  It was deep red until just about 25 years ago.
[03:17:13.425 --> 03:17:23.248]  The Democrats came in, they opened the borders, they engineered the state, they created socialism, dependency, and now the state is a skeleton of its former self.
[03:17:24.548 --> 03:17:31.090]  And now Beto and others have set their sights to turn Texas blue, and most political experts agree by 20
[03:17:33.239 --> 03:17:35.981]  24.
[03:17:33.599 --> 03:17:35.981]  Texas will be deep blue.
[03:17:36.921 --> 03:17:38.502]  My fellow Texans are in a coma.
[03:17:38.982 --> 03:17:46.165]  But as Kennedy said, and as Eisenhower said, and as Nixon said, and as Reagan said, as goes Texas, so goes the nation.
[03:17:46.385 --> 03:17:49.187]  It's been like that since the Civil War.
[03:17:50.627 --> 03:17:51.528]  That's a whole other history book.
[03:17:52.548 --> 03:18:00.772]  And so the fall of California, and it's a big gaping hole in our defenses for the collapse of Latin America, it's not a positive thing.
[03:18:02.449 --> 03:18:13.938]  It's not something I celebrate, it's like whistling past the graveyard, but... The carpetbaggers from all over the country that went to California, because it was the best state 30 years ago, who aren't Californians.
[03:18:14.678 --> 03:18:16.560]  They ruined that incredible state.
[03:18:17.360 --> 03:18:19.402]  They destroyed that incredible state.
[03:18:20.905 --> 03:18:29.629]  And now like locusts, or piranhas, or Nazi U-Boat wolf packs, they have come to Texas to ruin our state.
[03:18:30.069 --> 03:18:47.518]  We have 10 different amazing t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com, like this Don't California by USA flag t-shirt at InfoWarsTore.com that are great attention grabbers and conversation starters no matter where you live.
[03:18:48.641 --> 03:18:57.249]  In the country, because if the Democrats can take down Texas and Florida, it's over, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:18:58.536 --> 03:19:03.098]  The globalists want InfoWars shut down because they can track back.
[03:19:03.179 --> 03:19:05.080]  Almost all their defeats are to what we do.
[03:19:05.800 --> 03:19:08.661]  I instinctively know how to defeat them, just like you do.
[03:19:08.942 --> 03:19:09.922]  Probably resonate together.
[03:19:10.542 --> 03:19:13.544]  And I'm telling you, this don't California, my USA.
[03:19:13.904 --> 03:19:16.566]  This don't California, my Texas is the answer.
[03:19:16.806 --> 03:19:18.027]  But people have to be warned.
[03:19:18.607 --> 03:19:25.751]  We have 10 different limited edition shirts at InfoWarsTore.com right now for men and women in all the sizes.
[03:19:26.451 --> 03:19:28.272]  And I want this to be a major movement.
[03:19:29.232 --> 03:19:33.173]  And so, for the next week or so, while supplies last, 50% off.
[03:19:33.193 --> 03:19:38.075]  That means I'm making 5 bucks on these shirts that funds the InfoWars.
[03:19:38.095 --> 03:19:44.337]  So spread the word, meet like-minded people, cause a debate, become a billboard for liberty and freedom today.
[03:19:44.357 --> 03:19:50.279]  InfoWarsStore.com and look at the 10 limited edition
[03:19:51.363 --> 03:19:52.884]  Don't California my USA.
[03:19:52.904 --> 03:19:53.965]  Don't California Texas.
[03:19:54.506 --> 03:19:56.408]  I welcome folks to say don't California Florida.
[03:19:56.608 --> 03:19:59.110]  Let's just get this going nationwide and let's win again.
[03:19:59.430 --> 03:20:00.812]  We can do it if we take action.
[03:20:01.012 --> 03:20:02.233]  We can save America.
[03:20:06.197 --> 03:20:08.839]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.545 --> 03:20:17.425]  You found it.
[03:20:17.745 --> 03:20:19.246]  The tip of the spear.
[03:20:19.766 --> 03:20:22.347]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:23.607 --> 03:20:31.969]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
[03:20:32.029 --> 03:20:37.491]  Harping on wars we fight and griping about the way things ought to be.
[03:20:37.531 --> 03:20:38.531]  I don't mind them.
[03:20:39.955 --> 03:20:46.940]  Don't pose like you're Americans when you're Democrats.
[03:20:47.140 --> 03:20:50.663]  Bunch of anti-American trash.
[03:20:51.283 --> 03:20:53.485]  We've been whipping your ass for a long time.
[03:20:54.165 --> 03:20:57.587]  Get ready to get your ass kicked even worse.
[03:20:57.968 --> 03:20:59.589]  Running down the way of life.
[03:20:59.609 --> 03:21:02.090]  If you don't love it, leave it.
[03:21:02.210 --> 03:21:02.891]  Crank it up.
[03:21:13.390 --> 03:21:19.132]  Tom Papper's taking over, but I've commandeered the first half hour to finish your calls, and then I pledge to you.
[03:21:19.772 --> 03:21:21.253]  I'm coming in tomorrow afternoon.
[03:21:21.653 --> 03:21:25.374]  There's a big vaccine announcement, and the other news I haven't hit.
[03:21:25.654 --> 03:21:27.015]  Let's say three o'clock tomorrow.
[03:21:27.755 --> 03:21:28.475]  Got a live feed.
[03:21:28.695 --> 03:21:29.375]  Saturday show.
[03:21:31.396 --> 03:21:32.857]  I hear about some squirrely guy.
[03:21:35.597 --> 03:21:36.878]  He don't believe in fighting.
[03:21:38.450 --> 03:21:40.231]  All right, let's go back to your phone calls right now.
[03:21:41.472 --> 03:21:46.155]  We got John, and we got Chase, and we got Jude, and we got Jacob.
[03:21:46.415 --> 03:21:48.816]  Jacob's been holding a long time.
[03:21:49.357 --> 03:21:50.938]  Jacob in Kansas, you're up next.
[03:21:50.998 --> 03:21:52.579]  Thank you so much for holding, Jacob.
[03:21:52.599 --> 03:21:53.259]  You're awesome.
[03:21:55.380 --> 03:21:56.681]  No problem, Alex.
[03:21:56.701 --> 03:21:57.282]  Good to be on.
[03:21:57.302 --> 03:21:58.042]  Never been on before.
[03:21:58.502 --> 03:21:59.063]  Welcome, sir.
[03:21:59.103 --> 03:21:59.803]  Thank you for holding.
[03:22:01.824 --> 03:22:05.627]  I just had a couple of things to talk about as far as the mule report.
[03:22:06.866 --> 03:22:11.670]  I'm thinking more along the lines of another one of those Democratic faves.
[03:22:13.551 --> 03:22:20.977]  All of the media, everybody's just focusing harder and harder and harder on this, even after it's been completely debunked time and time again.
[03:22:22.017 --> 03:22:36.048]  And so, I'm feeling more like this is a fallback option every time something new comes out, like when the Virginia governor came out as an obvious infanticide guy.
[03:22:37.728 --> 03:22:38.228]  No, you're right.
[03:22:38.268 --> 03:22:43.152]  We should make it front and center that North Carolina vetoed a bill saying don't kill babies after they're born.
[03:22:43.293 --> 03:22:45.114]  That was my top story today and I never covered it.
[03:22:45.474 --> 03:22:47.616]  I'll cover it tomorrow in a special report, I promise.
[03:22:48.717 --> 03:22:49.638]  You're absolutely right.
[03:22:51.980 --> 03:23:02.488]  Watching them in this display of evil, where they sit there and they get caught doing it and they just reboot it again and we put up with them like they're the authority figure.
[03:23:02.869 --> 03:23:05.431]  What do you think President Trump should do, Jacob?
[03:23:07.897 --> 03:23:13.158]  I've got a lot of callers talking about how he almost undermined the Constitution to a certain degree.
[03:23:14.418 --> 03:23:16.059]  They've undermined it.
[03:23:16.079 --> 03:23:17.539]  They're a foreign globalist threat.
[03:23:18.499 --> 03:23:19.699]  How do you deal with the cancer?
[03:23:20.760 --> 03:23:26.061]  That's the hard part, though, because you've got to be in line with the Constitution while you do it all the way down.
[03:23:26.121 --> 03:23:33.722]  Otherwise, the people who are on the left and everybody else who doesn't really know what's going on, they're going to start thinking that
[03:23:34.324 --> 03:23:37.746]  All the things that the media was talking about, now it's come true.
[03:23:38.086 --> 03:23:45.650]  Well, if Trump wiped all these people out, which he's got leadership to do, and then when they were gone, if he kept it going, I would oppose him.
[03:23:46.431 --> 03:23:49.292]  But we have a foreign globalist power trying to wipe us out.
[03:23:50.153 --> 03:23:56.636]  So when somebody's in your face punching you, you're not martial law to stand up and wipe them out.
[03:23:57.137 --> 03:24:00.458]  When you have an infestation in your government, the response is to remove them.
[03:24:00.478 --> 03:24:01.239]  God bless you, Jacob.
[03:24:03.032 --> 03:24:03.893]  And I've taken this there.
[03:24:03.953 --> 03:24:04.653]  We're at that point.
[03:24:05.934 --> 03:24:07.776]  They want to get me off air because I'll say that.
[03:24:07.796 --> 03:24:12.139]  It's not like some great thing I want to do just because it's fun for me to do it.
[03:24:12.159 --> 03:24:14.901]  These people need to be at the Nuremberg trial.
[03:24:15.942 --> 03:24:16.942]  Bob in Washington.
[03:24:16.962 --> 03:24:17.503]  You're on the air.
[03:24:17.563 --> 03:24:18.203]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:24:18.243 --> 03:24:18.563]  Welcome.
[03:24:19.104 --> 03:24:19.624]  Hey, Alex.
[03:24:19.644 --> 03:24:20.485]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:24:20.505 --> 03:24:20.965]  Appreciate it.
[03:24:20.985 --> 03:24:21.386]  Thank you.
[03:24:21.406 --> 03:24:28.271]  Yeah, I just wanted to respond to your previous caller, Frank, and how
[03:24:29.557 --> 03:24:34.298]  You know, the media in general is trying to get you to compromise, to say that you'll tone it back.
[03:24:34.638 --> 03:24:49.361]  I saw a podcast that you were on with a young man that had gotten in trouble in Japan, and anyway, his co-host kept on you for maybe about 10-15 minutes asking you, just tone it down, just tone it down, and yet you stood firm.
[03:24:49.541 --> 03:24:53.502]  And I just wanted to give you some encouragement to continue to stay firm.
[03:24:54.397 --> 03:24:55.659]  Well yeah, that was Logan Paul.
[03:24:57.261 --> 03:25:01.648]  They just say, once you tone it down once, well how many times you gotta tone it down?
[03:25:03.317 --> 03:25:03.797]  Exactly.
[03:25:04.318 --> 03:25:16.786]  You know, the Christians in 64 to 313 AD, all they had to do was do an act of worship to, you know, to the Emperor.
[03:25:16.806 --> 03:25:17.406]  To Saturn.
[03:25:18.147 --> 03:25:23.290]  Just worship the Emperor and, you know, we won't, you know, we'll let you go.
[03:25:24.010 --> 03:25:27.172]  Just worship Jupiter, just worship Saturn.
[03:25:28.093 --> 03:25:29.194]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:25:30.672 --> 03:25:33.534]  So anyway, just wanted to put my two bits in.
[03:25:33.714 --> 03:25:34.414]  I appreciate you.
[03:25:34.474 --> 03:25:35.715]  What do you think Trump needs to do?
[03:25:35.735 --> 03:25:39.317]  Because the Democrats have been caught in a giant fraud and now they're doubling down.
[03:25:39.337 --> 03:25:41.017]  I mean, how long do we put up with this?
[03:25:42.158 --> 03:25:44.299]  Well, that's a bit above my pay grade.
[03:25:44.999 --> 03:25:51.803]  But if Trump, you know, wanted to stop the influx of all these caravans,
[03:25:52.912 --> 03:25:56.955]  He should just freeze the accounts of the people that are, you know, behind it.
[03:25:57.275 --> 03:25:59.917]  Just, you know, he doesn't have to confiscate it or anything.
[03:25:59.957 --> 03:26:03.120]  Just freeze the account and tell them investigation's done.
[03:26:03.580 --> 03:26:03.940]  That's it.
[03:26:04.821 --> 03:26:05.301]  Good point.
[03:26:05.321 --> 03:26:06.422]  Thank you so much, Bob.
[03:26:06.942 --> 03:26:08.864]  Marcos in the great state of Texas.
[03:26:09.384 --> 03:26:10.345]  Marcos, thanks for holding.
[03:26:10.385 --> 03:26:12.766]  I really appreciate you joining us on this Friday edition.
[03:26:12.786 --> 03:26:13.247]  What's your view?
[03:26:14.591 --> 03:26:15.252]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[03:26:15.292 --> 03:26:16.373]  I appreciate you having me on.
[03:26:16.413 --> 03:26:18.195]  First off, I wanted to thank you for bodies.
[03:26:18.215 --> 03:26:31.447]  I've been using it for a while, but I sent a bottle to my mom, and after taking it for a few days, she called me literally in tears, saying that she could see the knuckles on her fingers again, and the bones in her knees again.
[03:26:31.908 --> 03:26:33.029]  She was ecstatic.
[03:26:33.049 --> 03:26:37.974]  So, personal thank you to you for that, because anybody who makes my mom's life
[03:26:38.442 --> 03:26:40.905]  A little bit easier, has a special place in my heart.
[03:26:49.448 --> 03:26:53.052]  Thank you for giving us your testimony about your mother because bodies is amazing.
[03:27:12.168 --> 03:27:12.969]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[03:27:13.609 --> 03:27:31.324]  I did want to touch a little bit actually about the Logan Paul podcast that when Caitlyn Bennett was on, I've heard a lot of arguments about how people say, you know, how are you going to defend yourself if they actually do come and get your guns one day because our firepower doesn't match?
[03:27:32.097 --> 03:27:32.337]  I don't
[03:27:51.283 --> 03:27:56.904]  Creating a well-regulated militia amongst ourselves and our neighbors and our neighborhood.
[03:27:57.284 --> 03:28:03.766]  Not necessarily a militia ready to fight, you know, or to go into... But defensive.
[03:28:05.026 --> 03:28:05.946]  Defensive, exactly.
[03:28:06.006 --> 03:28:12.087]  But also a regulated militia of ideas, of faith, and coming together... Oh my gosh!
[03:28:12.107 --> 03:28:13.347]  A militia of the mind.
[03:28:13.988 --> 03:28:15.108]  An army of the mind.
[03:28:15.148 --> 03:28:15.908]  That's a great idea.
[03:28:17.088 --> 03:28:23.754]  Exactly, and what I've been trying to do in my neighborhood is, you know, I've been using a next door app.
[03:28:24.094 --> 03:28:25.615]  There's also, you know, those neighborhood apps.
[03:28:26.116 --> 03:28:27.797]  Invite people over for barbecues.
[03:28:28.678 --> 03:28:30.059]  Oh, nothing can stop you.
[03:28:30.079 --> 03:28:31.320]  The sensors can't block you.
[03:28:31.360 --> 03:28:34.243]  No one can stop you when you take action at Point Blank Range.
[03:28:34.283 --> 03:28:34.863]  God bless you.
[03:28:34.903 --> 03:28:35.664]  I thank you so much.
[03:28:36.084 --> 03:28:38.485]  I'm sorry to John, Chase, Jude, Tim.
[03:28:38.905 --> 03:28:39.545]  I'm out of time.
[03:28:39.565 --> 03:28:41.545]  I took like 30 calls, though, which is a good job of the crew.
[03:28:41.945 --> 03:28:43.706]  Tom Papert, I'm already over in 30 minutes.
[03:28:44.106 --> 03:28:45.386]  Great TV station manager.
[03:28:45.886 --> 03:28:47.446]  Trump got in for a website runner.
[03:28:47.766 --> 03:28:49.327]  He is loaded for bear for two segments.
[03:28:49.347 --> 03:28:50.647]  He's taking over right now.
[03:28:50.707 --> 03:28:52.087]  Then, The War Room.
[03:28:52.287 --> 03:28:53.608]  Owen Schroyer.
[03:28:53.628 --> 03:28:54.548]  3 o'clock today.
[03:28:54.708 --> 03:28:56.088]  Infowars.com.
[03:28:56.528 --> 03:28:57.368]  Forward slash show.
[03:28:57.789 --> 03:28:58.729]  Please spread that link.
[03:28:58.809 --> 03:28:59.569]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:02.542 --> 03:29:04.392]  I've got a big announcement to make.
[03:29:04.773 --> 03:29:06.844]  We've got four or five positions.
[03:29:14.156 --> 03:29:27.920]  If you want to really be involved in the heart of the fight against the globalist, send your resumes, both confidential and private, to techjobsatinfowars.com.
[03:29:28.120 --> 03:29:32.721]  Again, we've got four or five places we want to fill, and a lot of new secret projects going on.
[03:29:32.981 --> 03:29:40.863]  The point is, if you want to build freedom in this country and promote free speech, and you want to help InfoWars go to the next level, we want to hire you.
[03:29:41.403 --> 03:29:43.324]  Send your resumes to techjobs.com.
[03:29:43.524 --> 03:29:45.085]  Tech jobs at Infowars.com today.
[03:29:45.105 --> 03:29:50.490]  I look forward to meeting some of you and shaking your hand and having you jump on Millennium Falcon the start of Episode 4.
[03:29:50.530 --> 03:29:52.211]  Because that's what you're going to be doing.
[03:29:52.231 --> 03:29:54.032]  This is the real ticket to adventure.
[03:29:55.113 --> 03:29:57.595]  Tech jobs at Infowars.com.
[03:29:57.815 --> 03:29:59.657]  Tech jobs at Infowars.com.
[03:29:59.757 --> 03:30:01.018]  Tech jobs.
[03:30:05.546 --> 03:30:06.266]  There is a mission.
[03:30:06.646 --> 03:30:08.527]  I'm asking you to accept it and take action.
[03:30:08.667 --> 03:30:11.608]  We've had such a huge effect over the years with our t-shirts.
[03:30:11.908 --> 03:30:14.029]  We haven't had a hit t-shirt over a year.
[03:30:14.149 --> 03:30:21.111]  Yeah, we sell a few hundred here, a few thousand there, but when we had 50,000 Hillary for Prisoners shirts on the street, or Obama, Joker, 100,000 on the street.
[03:30:22.111 --> 03:30:24.692]  It changed the world, and it funded the InfoWar.
[03:30:24.953 --> 03:30:28.034]  All of our apparel is 50% off.
[03:30:28.074 --> 03:30:30.916]  That's all the t-shirts, all the ball caps, all everything.
[03:30:31.076 --> 03:30:39.581]  So, again, I would encourage listeners to understand, if you're on a right wing or national hysteria, you'll get pats on the back, a cup of coffee, probably bought before you wear an InfoWar shirt, meet a lot of like-minded people.
[03:30:39.661 --> 03:30:40.281]  It's a real adventure.
[03:30:40.361 --> 03:30:42.142]  But if you're in a left hysteria, they don't speak Latin.
[03:30:42.202 --> 03:30:42.662]  We're good to go.
[03:31:03.098 --> 03:31:04.860]  You know, our audience really doesn't run.
[03:31:05.000 --> 03:31:07.122]  So I made all these t-shirts that don't have InfoWars on them.
[03:31:07.162 --> 03:31:10.806]  And people like them, but nothing like they do the ones that are loud and proud.
[03:31:10.846 --> 03:31:13.088]  InfoWars.com or that Trump Medusa t-shirt.
[03:31:13.108 --> 03:31:13.749]  It's my favorite.
[03:31:13.789 --> 03:31:19.254]  But the best-selling is the in-your-face, big, bright red InfoWars.com shirt.
[03:31:19.355 --> 03:31:20.616]  That's the one everybody wants.
[03:31:20.876 --> 03:31:30.843]  Right there, we have the Don't Tread On Me, we have Mean Like A Wolverine, we have a bunch of great ball caps, 1776, 50% off all apparel, and they point out it's annual.
[03:31:30.943 --> 03:31:33.485]  We've not done this, I looked it up, in over a year.
[03:31:33.705 --> 03:31:36.627]  Listen, the dollar isn't what it used to be, but everything is 50% off.
[03:31:36.707 --> 03:31:41.050]  We go and look at what the purchase order is, what it was, and give you literally 50% off.
[03:31:41.390 --> 03:31:46.534]  This is the best time, and these shirts freak the leftists out, the globalists out, and it helps fund this great operation.
[03:31:46.754 --> 03:31:47.554]  All apparel, 50% off.
[03:31:48.595 --> 03:31:51.497]  And InfoWarsTore.com haven't done this in over a year.
[03:31:51.738 --> 03:31:55.861]  InfoWarsTore.com takes you right there at 888-253-3139.
[03:31:55.961 --> 03:31:59.063]  Wear your colors loud and proud at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:32:06.750 --> 03:32:10.693]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[03:32:12.392 --> 03:32:15.414]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[03:32:15.535 --> 03:32:17.576]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[03:32:18.197 --> 03:32:22.020]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[03:32:22.500 --> 03:32:29.886]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[03:32:29.986 --> 03:32:32.408]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[03:32:35.845 --> 03:32:38.026]  We have seen what they want to do.
[03:32:38.066 --> 03:32:41.227]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[03:32:41.487 --> 03:32:52.230]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[03:32:54.150 --> 03:32:57.471]  Never miss your show, any day.
[03:32:57.511 --> 03:32:58.671]  I mean, never.
[03:33:06.149 --> 03:33:08.871]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.057 --> 03:33:18.498]  Ah, Tom Pepper.
[03:33:28.704 --> 03:33:31.586]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:31.606 --> 03:33:34.849]  I'm not sure, was that a Potbelly Goblin introducing me?
[03:33:34.909 --> 03:33:35.369]  I don't know.
[03:33:35.669 --> 03:33:37.290]  It's Tom Papert.
[03:33:37.871 --> 03:33:39.572]  He doesn't want to kill babies.
[03:33:39.612 --> 03:33:40.653]  He's bad.
[03:33:41.273 --> 03:33:45.296]  Is that the black-faced baby killer from... Who is that?
[03:33:45.336 --> 03:33:47.037]  What is that creature on the other end?
[03:33:47.118 --> 03:33:50.660]  North Carolina legalized killing babies after they're born.
[03:33:51.180 --> 03:33:52.762]  Liberal, Papert.
[03:33:52.882 --> 03:33:53.542]  Liberal.
[03:33:53.882 --> 03:33:54.903]  Don't be racist.
[03:33:54.963 --> 03:33:55.784]  Kill babies.
[03:33:56.291 --> 03:34:03.339]  That's either Ralph Northam or we have George Soros hacking into the InfoWars mainframe and I'm hearing it just ethereally.
[03:34:03.379 --> 03:34:06.002]  How dare you not kill babies, Pepe?
[03:34:06.602 --> 03:34:07.904]  He wants me to kill babies?
[03:34:08.364 --> 03:34:10.166]  How dare you not kill them?
[03:34:10.246 --> 03:34:10.787]  It's literally...
[03:34:13.484 --> 03:34:17.606]  Do I wait until they're born and then if they're viable outside the window?
[03:34:17.626 --> 03:34:23.789]  No, if Carolina just vetoed a law to not kill babies after they're born, it's superior.
[03:34:24.230 --> 03:34:27.051]  You're in the KKK if you don't kill babies.
[03:34:27.772 --> 03:34:31.374]  Say you want to murder babies or you're not liberal.
[03:34:31.814 --> 03:34:33.415]  Say murder babies!
[03:34:33.635 --> 03:34:34.836]  Murder babies!
[03:34:35.609 --> 03:34:36.369]  Murder babies.
[03:34:36.509 --> 03:34:37.009]  This is it.
[03:34:37.069 --> 03:34:38.610]  This is the program.
[03:34:39.150 --> 03:34:40.690]  Now you're liberal.
[03:34:40.810 --> 03:34:42.531]  Good.
[03:34:43.051 --> 03:34:45.091]  Can I resist the NPC programming?
[03:34:45.511 --> 03:34:47.032]  It's coming directly into my brain.
[03:34:47.572 --> 03:34:49.232]  We keep them comfortable.
[03:34:49.252 --> 03:34:50.873]  We take their organs.
[03:34:52.533 --> 03:35:01.235]  A potbelly goblin is confirming to me that it is a Republican stance to kill babies after they have been born and sell their organs for profit.
[03:35:01.835 --> 03:35:03.416]  This is breaking news here at NPR.
[03:35:03.436 --> 03:35:04.936]  The Democrats are right.
[03:35:05.691 --> 03:35:07.712]  We need to kill the babies.
[03:35:08.732 --> 03:35:09.653]  Kill the babies?
[03:35:10.073 --> 03:35:11.154]  It all makes sense now.
[03:35:11.614 --> 03:35:15.536]  The blackface KKK baby murderer, he was right all along.
[03:35:16.656 --> 03:35:17.396]  It's so clear.
[03:35:17.937 --> 03:35:18.657]  Kill the babies.
[03:35:18.677 --> 03:35:20.818]  Governor Northam knows what to do.
[03:35:21.959 --> 03:35:22.899]  Sell their organs.
[03:35:22.959 --> 03:35:24.120]  He doesn't let him run things.
[03:35:25.200 --> 03:35:31.223]  Let Governor Northam become Supreme Chancellor of Planned Parenthood and take over the United States.
[03:35:32.103 --> 03:35:33.244]  It's all so clear to me now.
[03:35:33.985 --> 03:35:35.106]  I love Hillary Clinton.
[03:35:35.306 --> 03:35:36.267]  I love Ralph Northam.
[03:35:36.447 --> 03:35:39.269]  Blackface KKK baby murderers should be president.
[03:35:39.689 --> 03:35:48.516]  You might want to roll out how this whole history is actually the KKK and killing babies and he wants to harvest their organs, but it doesn't matter.
[03:35:48.536 --> 03:35:49.717]  We keep them comfortable.
[03:35:51.278 --> 03:35:54.400]  Keep them comfortable and discuss it and decide who wants to do it.
[03:35:54.460 --> 03:35:59.224]  But it's true though, Margaret Sanger... You don't want the law involved, the government.
[03:35:59.264 --> 03:36:00.885]  No, no, that would be an infringement.
[03:36:01.065 --> 03:36:03.207]  These little loving flesh bones.
[03:36:04.306 --> 03:36:07.210]  We need the government to tell us what to eat, think, and do.
[03:36:07.591 --> 03:36:12.037]  But when it comes to murdering babies, you just let the doctor and the woman decide.
[03:36:12.077 --> 03:36:13.238]  That makes so much sense!
[03:36:15.101 --> 03:36:17.925]  But getting rid of a baby after it's born?
[03:36:18.806 --> 03:36:20.849]  Why, that's a little fleshball.
[03:36:22.486 --> 03:36:24.168]  It's just, it's right in my ear.
[03:36:24.388 --> 03:36:25.269]  It, this is it!
[03:36:25.329 --> 03:36:27.532]  The NPC programming is taking over!
[03:36:27.732 --> 03:36:31.477]  Pepper, it's time to kill the baby.
[03:36:31.497 --> 03:36:33.159]  It's time to kill the baby?
[03:36:33.179 --> 03:36:35.241]  Pepper, just kill babies.
[03:36:35.882 --> 03:36:36.342]  Just kill them all?
[03:36:36.382 --> 03:36:37.283]  Then you'll be liberal.
[03:36:37.724 --> 03:36:39.846]  The devil loves you, Pepper.
[03:36:40.687 --> 03:36:45.072]  The devils will accept me if we murder the babies.
[03:36:45.092 --> 03:36:47.915]  Oh, Channel 5 wants to kill them.
[03:36:49.196 --> 03:36:51.699]  Oh, it's liberal.
[03:36:51.719 --> 03:36:53.721]  Oh, you'll be so cool.
[03:36:53.741 --> 03:36:55.663]  This is it.
[03:36:55.743 --> 03:36:56.904]  This is how I can do it.
[03:36:57.164 --> 03:36:58.325]  They'll hire me at CNN.
[03:36:58.365 --> 03:36:59.787]  All I have to do is kill the babies.
[03:37:01.292 --> 03:37:02.693]  Kill the babies.
[03:37:03.394 --> 03:37:04.235]  Kill the babies?
[03:37:04.375 --> 03:37:05.596]  Kill the babies.
[03:37:06.417 --> 03:37:06.757]  Kill them.
[03:37:06.797 --> 03:37:07.098]  That's it.
[03:37:08.039 --> 03:37:10.701]  And thanks to Planned Parenthood, I don't even have to be a doctor.
[03:37:10.721 --> 03:37:13.203]  Those babies, those white babies are racist.
[03:37:14.144 --> 03:37:17.387]  The white babies are racist and the black babies, they'll grow up to be super predators.
[03:37:17.407 --> 03:37:20.070]  I have the articles here in my stack.
[03:37:20.650 --> 03:37:22.212]  North Carolina Governor.
[03:37:22.232 --> 03:37:25.075]  Let me show TV viewers from here.
[03:37:26.121 --> 03:37:30.045]  North Carolina governor vetoes born alive bill.
[03:37:31.166 --> 03:37:37.713]  Bill explicitly directs physicians to provide care for infants who survive abortion.
[03:37:38.394 --> 03:37:41.677]  No, we gonna kill that baby.
[03:37:42.678 --> 03:37:45.921]  So long as they're kept comfortable, you can kill them.
[03:37:46.101 --> 03:37:46.702]  Sacrifice them.
[03:37:46.762 --> 03:37:49.285]  We keep them comfortable while we get their goodies.
[03:37:51.094 --> 03:37:53.495]  We don't just take the babies, Papa.
[03:37:54.175 --> 03:37:56.716]  We take their goodlies, their chitlins.
[03:37:58.417 --> 03:38:00.858]  Just think of all the great things we can do with that money.
[03:38:00.878 --> 03:38:15.844]  Let Governor... Let the Governor have the little... Let him have the babies' chitlins, the gizzards, and the... It's liberal.
[03:38:18.081 --> 03:38:18.641]  This is it.
[03:38:19.101 --> 03:38:20.722]  This is how we achieve utopia.
[03:38:20.782 --> 03:38:21.382]  I'm hearing it.
[03:38:21.442 --> 03:38:22.802]  It's all coming in so clear now.
[03:38:22.842 --> 03:38:24.722]  We kill the babies, yes.
[03:38:25.162 --> 03:38:25.762]  Kill the babies?
[03:38:25.782 --> 03:38:28.683]  All you need to do is sign on to killin' babies, Pepper.
[03:38:29.483 --> 03:38:31.043]  Kill the babies and worship Satan?
[03:38:31.243 --> 03:38:34.264]  Then you could be Channel 5, could be in New York.
[03:38:35.164 --> 03:38:36.204]  We can move to New York?
[03:38:36.224 --> 03:38:38.485]  With Governor Northam, oh.
[03:38:38.505 --> 03:38:41.105]  We can have Governor Northam as our General Manager?
[03:38:41.125 --> 03:38:42.105]  Oh, baby organs are good.
[03:38:42.386 --> 03:38:44.326]  You know, we joke about this, but this is the real ballgame.
[03:38:44.346 --> 03:38:44.806]  You take over.
[03:38:46.351 --> 03:38:47.472]  It is absolutely insane.
[03:38:47.492 --> 03:38:57.198]  Of course, Alex is referencing the Ralph Northam blackface baby murderer in Virginia, who today, or maybe it was yesterday, vetoed a field... But we keep him comfortable?
[03:38:58.059 --> 03:39:00.000]  You just gotta keep him comfortable, and then it's okay.
[03:39:00.060 --> 03:39:00.761]  Do whatever you want.
[03:39:00.801 --> 03:39:01.401]  You sell the orphan.
[03:39:01.421 --> 03:39:02.722]  I kidnapped you and took you to a field.
[03:39:03.142 --> 03:39:06.104]  Maybe give you a heroin shot before I blow your head off.
[03:39:06.124 --> 03:39:08.066]  It's like, I'll keep you comfortable.
[03:39:08.886 --> 03:39:09.847]  As long as you're comfortable.
[03:39:10.227 --> 03:39:12.248]  I mean, he wants these babies.
[03:39:12.709 --> 03:39:14.430]  We sure want the gizzards.
[03:39:16.948 --> 03:39:20.309]  It is just fascinating because, you know, you keep them comfortable and then it's not murder.
[03:39:20.810 --> 03:39:23.771]  Then it's comfort-assisted suicide for infants.
[03:39:23.811 --> 03:39:24.492]  We take the organs.
[03:39:25.332 --> 03:39:27.053]  We take the blood.
[03:39:28.034 --> 03:39:30.395]  We take the skin, Tom.
[03:39:31.275 --> 03:39:32.156]  You just sell it.
[03:39:32.376 --> 03:39:33.817]  You sell it to the highest bidder.
[03:39:33.917 --> 03:39:35.317]  It really does make so much sense.
[03:39:35.337 --> 03:39:36.678]  It's against a woman's right.
[03:39:37.178 --> 03:39:38.759]  We're going to cut this baby.
[03:39:38.779 --> 03:39:45.283]  We're going to keep it alive until the order comes through, but what's wrong with cutting the baby, Tom?
[03:39:46.727 --> 03:39:47.648]  Governor Blackface.
[03:39:47.668 --> 03:39:50.609]  Tom, just let us have the organs.
[03:39:51.450 --> 03:39:52.731]  They just want the organs.
[03:39:52.971 --> 03:39:53.831]  That's all they want.
[03:39:53.951 --> 03:39:54.412]  It's liberal.
[03:39:54.432 --> 03:39:55.232]  It's not so bad.
[03:39:56.433 --> 03:39:57.574]  Babies don't need organs.
[03:39:57.614 --> 03:40:00.055]  They're basically not people until they're three years old.
[03:40:00.075 --> 03:40:00.976]  Exactly.
[03:40:01.476 --> 03:40:02.517]  They're racist.
[03:40:03.817 --> 03:40:04.378]  That's right.
[03:40:05.218 --> 03:40:09.561]  Because if we let white babies grow up, they might listen to InfoWars.
[03:40:10.478 --> 03:40:13.100]  They might want to be a Trump supporter, even.
[03:40:13.120 --> 03:40:16.903]  Tom, we need to take the babies goodly-lookals.
[03:40:18.064 --> 03:40:20.807]  You imagine how much money as a governor I made?
[03:40:20.827 --> 03:40:23.349]  The babies don't know.
[03:40:23.429 --> 03:40:24.710]  We keep them comfortable.
[03:40:25.971 --> 03:40:26.572]  All the money?
[03:40:27.232 --> 03:40:28.013]  All we have to do?
[03:40:28.033 --> 03:40:29.234]  It makes so much sense.
[03:40:29.274 --> 03:40:31.316]  Just sign on to killing babies, Tom.
[03:40:32.397 --> 03:40:33.798]  You can make a lot of money.
[03:40:34.741 --> 03:40:35.901]  Why sell supplements?
[03:40:35.981 --> 03:40:37.982]  Why sell amazing products?
[03:40:38.082 --> 03:40:41.723]  Why sell t-shirts when you can sell babies?
[03:40:42.503 --> 03:40:46.944]  And the best part is you don't ever have to put baby parts at 50% off.
[03:40:47.104 --> 03:40:48.344]  You just sell them wholesale.
[03:40:48.605 --> 03:40:49.265]  Exactly.
[03:40:49.285 --> 03:40:50.825]  That's why we want to keep them alive.
[03:40:51.265 --> 03:40:55.006]  We don't get top dollar unless we keep them alive.
[03:40:55.106 --> 03:40:57.767]  And racists don't want us to kill the babies, Tom.
[03:40:58.427 --> 03:40:59.787]  We have to maximize profits.
[03:40:59.807 --> 03:41:01.768]  Racists are bad people, Tom.
[03:41:03.450 --> 03:41:07.212]  Governor Northam though, he's a good man.
[03:41:07.232 --> 03:41:09.933]  He's a doctor, he has to be a good man.
[03:41:09.953 --> 03:41:11.974]  Now you see, Tom.
[03:41:13.195 --> 03:41:14.035]  It's all so clear.
[03:41:14.055 --> 03:41:18.898]  The NPC programming, it makes sense now.
[03:41:19.798 --> 03:41:21.779]  I'm gonna let you take over, racist.
[03:41:22.599 --> 03:41:27.522]  If you want to apologize for not wanting to kill the babies, I'm ready to hear your apology.
[03:41:28.542 --> 03:41:31.663]  I hereby repudiate my former pro-life stances.
[03:41:31.803 --> 03:41:33.124]  Kill the babies.
[03:41:33.504 --> 03:41:34.564]  I want to kill the babies.
[03:41:34.584 --> 03:41:34.904]  I want to.
[03:41:34.964 --> 03:41:36.345]  Kill the babies.
[03:41:36.705 --> 03:41:37.645]  We have to kill the babies.
[03:41:38.205 --> 03:41:39.766]  Oh, liberal.
[03:41:40.286 --> 03:41:42.066]  Yeah, kill them.
[03:41:42.527 --> 03:41:43.227]  The future of liberalism.
[03:41:43.247 --> 03:41:48.008]  Will you volunteer to join the governor with the scalpel to cut that baby's liver out?
[03:41:48.548 --> 03:41:50.309]  We get you a little bit of the money.
[03:41:52.030 --> 03:41:53.670]  I can get money for killing babies too?
[03:41:53.690 --> 03:41:56.231]  You can get a lot of money, Tommy.
[03:41:57.574 --> 03:41:58.635]  Did we all just come together?
[03:41:58.655 --> 03:42:00.316]  Tell me the babies aren't human.
[03:42:01.536 --> 03:42:02.617]  Babies aren't people.
[03:42:02.797 --> 03:42:05.358]  Good old Tom.
[03:42:05.839 --> 03:42:07.579]  You're gonna be a senator now.
[03:42:07.599 --> 03:42:09.501]  Not just a governor.
[03:42:10.161 --> 03:42:10.581]  Kill babies.
[03:42:10.601 --> 03:42:10.921]  Kill babies.
[03:42:11.021 --> 03:42:13.223]  I get to go to the Senate?
[03:42:13.243 --> 03:42:13.943]  I get to be a globalist?
[03:42:14.123 --> 03:42:17.245]  Just say, kill babies.
[03:42:18.490 --> 03:42:19.031]  Here I am.
[03:42:19.171 --> 03:42:19.691]  This is it.
[03:42:20.111 --> 03:42:23.034]  I will sacrifice myself on the altar of globalism.
[03:42:23.094 --> 03:42:23.895]  Kill the babies.
[03:42:24.915 --> 03:42:25.596]  Sell the parts.
[03:42:26.277 --> 03:42:28.899]  Oh, Tom, you're a president now.
[03:42:30.400 --> 03:42:31.301]  Tom!
[03:42:31.821 --> 03:42:33.282]  Oh, you're so smart.
[03:42:33.322 --> 03:42:34.423]  You're so sweet.
[03:42:35.643 --> 03:42:37.224]  I love Tom Peppett.
[03:42:37.264 --> 03:42:39.966]  He says, got them little babies.
[03:42:39.986 --> 03:42:41.667]  I think you agree.
[03:42:42.547 --> 03:42:50.292]  We gonna do a good job on those babies, cause nobody gonna speak up for them but Governor Northam.
[03:42:51.493 --> 03:42:53.434]  Coming up, Tom Peppett.
[03:42:53.975 --> 03:42:57.597]  Straight ahead, you wanna stay with us, stay with us.
[03:42:58.097 --> 03:43:00.159]  Don't share the link though, it's racist.
[03:43:02.779 --> 03:43:04.521]  I've got a big announcement to make.
[03:43:04.901 --> 03:43:12.227]  We've got four or five positions in IT and a bunch of very exciting projects we want to launch.
[03:43:12.788 --> 03:43:28.060]  If you see things going on at InfoWars that you want to make better, and if you want to really be involved in the heart of the fight against the globalist, send your resumes, completely confidential and private, to techjobs at InfoWars.com.
[03:43:28.240 --> 03:43:30.302]  Again, we've got four or five places we want to fill.
[03:43:30.742 --> 03:43:32.903]  We've got a lot of new secret projects going on.
[03:43:33.103 --> 03:43:40.948]  The point is, if you want to build freedom in this country and promote free speech, and you want to help InfoWars go to the next level, we want to hire you.
[03:43:41.528 --> 03:43:45.230]  Send your resumes to techjobs at InfoWars.com today.
[03:43:45.251 --> 03:43:52.155]  I look forward to meeting some of you and shaking your hand and having you jump on the Millennium Falcon at the start of Episode 4, because that's what you're going to be doing.
[03:43:52.375 --> 03:43:54.076]  This is the real ticket to adventure.
[03:43:55.236 --> 03:44:02.540]  TechJobs at Infowars.com TechJobs at Infowars.com TechJobs at Infowars.com
[03:44:11.172 --> 03:44:13.295]  All right, let's talk to Jim in Dallas.
[03:44:13.415 --> 03:44:14.777]  Jim, you're on the air.
[03:44:15.238 --> 03:44:16.920]  You work with the State National Guard.
[03:44:16.960 --> 03:44:18.162]  People think, oh, State Guard.
[03:44:18.422 --> 03:44:22.929]  That's like the creme de la creme of patriots, working with federal and state, trying to defend the border.
[03:44:22.969 --> 03:44:25.512]  And Texas is the hot spot, so they're right in the middle of it.
[03:44:25.552 --> 03:44:26.734]  Jim, what are you witnessing down there?
[03:44:26.834 --> 03:44:30.477]  Well, Alex, we just had a staff meeting in Austin this morning.
[03:44:30.517 --> 03:44:38.624]  This isn't getting a lot of attention, but the Attorney General, Attorney General Paxton, and the Governor, Governor Abbott, have called up the Texas State Guard unit.
[03:44:38.664 --> 03:44:44.570]  We've been in contact with Hood and Blitz, and the Adjutant's Office there isn't talking to them, okay?
[03:44:44.610 --> 03:44:46.071]  For some unknown reason.
[03:44:46.111 --> 03:44:49.254]  Now, Major General Bowditch is the commander of all Texas forces.
[03:44:49.414 --> 03:44:53.615]  The Texas National Guard, the Texas Air National Guard, and the Texas State Guard.
[03:44:53.695 --> 03:44:56.376]  And he's activating members of the Texas State Guard.
[03:44:56.516 --> 03:45:01.577]  And, uh, the next step is the Texas National Guard, but that's got to be approved from Washington.
[03:45:01.597 --> 03:45:03.277]  Well, we don't have time for that, Alex.
[03:45:03.357 --> 03:45:13.360]  If the Border Patrol and the feds do not do something about this, the next step is Governor Abbott is going to authorize lethal force to prevent this tidal wave coming into the state of Texas.
[03:45:13.940 --> 03:45:24.391]  We're going to have armed members of the Texas State Guard down in McAllen and over in El Paso by 1800 tonight.
[03:45:24.411 --> 03:45:26.914]  This is coming to a breaking point.
[03:45:27.014 --> 03:45:31.239]  If the federal government is not going to defend Texas, Texans are going to defend Texas.
[03:45:31.639 --> 03:45:34.382]  And we're not waiting for the federal government to do anything.
[03:45:34.462 --> 03:45:41.850]  And I can tell you right now that the 4th and the 8th and the 19th regiments of the Texas State Guard will be there within 72 hours.
[03:45:41.970 --> 03:45:43.752]  And we're not going with rubber bullets.
[03:45:43.812 --> 03:45:45.394]  We're being issued live rounds.
[03:45:45.454 --> 03:45:53.342]  We will not let the federal government let Texas be invaded by a tidal wave of disease-carrying illegal aliens.
[03:45:53.562 --> 03:46:04.624]  And it's just a sad situation that the state of Texas pays 18% of all federal taxes and we can't get one cavalry soldier from Hood to come down and protect the border.
[03:46:04.784 --> 03:46:17.546]  It's not the responsibility of the state of Texas under our current constitutional setup for Texas to have to appropriate $5.2 billion to build a wall in our state because Congress in Washington can't get it done.
[03:46:17.606 --> 03:46:22.927]  But I'm here to tell you, like you've said on several occasions, real men are bred in Texas in the history
[03:46:23.307 --> 03:46:32.433]  No, I agree with you.
[03:46:32.473 --> 03:46:35.075]  But I'm just telling you, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
[03:46:35.295 --> 03:46:36.436]  The beds are overwhelmed.
[03:46:36.576 --> 03:46:37.637]  The feds are overwhelmed.
[03:46:37.657 --> 03:46:39.018]  The Border Patrol is overwhelmed.
[03:46:39.458 --> 03:46:41.259]  The Democrats are saying, just capitulate.
[03:46:41.539 --> 03:46:48.224]  If we let them break the border, literally 20% of Latin America in the next few years will spill in.
[03:46:48.804 --> 03:46:49.945]  This will be the end of the country.
[03:46:50.025 --> 03:46:51.566]  I mean, this is ending our sovereignty.
[03:46:52.967 --> 03:46:57.269]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:30.962 --> 03:47:33.985]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:34.105 --> 03:47:35.086]  I am Tom Papert.
[03:47:35.146 --> 03:47:39.309]  Facebook's got Emperor Trump filling in for Alex for these final few minutes of today's episode.
[03:47:39.329 --> 03:47:47.576]  There was a Potbelly Goblin of some type that was talking to me in the last segment, but I think InfoWars got him purged from the system.
[03:47:47.596 --> 03:47:48.457]  I think we're okay now.
[03:47:48.477 --> 03:47:50.799]  The NPC programming did not take over.
[03:47:50.839 --> 03:47:52.020]  Do not kill babies.
[03:47:52.200 --> 03:47:53.061]  Save the babies.
[03:47:53.121 --> 03:47:54.222]  Do not sell their parts.
[03:47:54.262 --> 03:47:55.603]  This isn't reverse psychology.
[03:47:55.943 --> 03:47:57.365]  It's definitely still not taking hold.
[03:47:58.065 --> 03:47:58.746]  Very important.
[03:47:58.886 --> 03:48:00.146]  Do not murder children.
[03:48:00.607 --> 03:48:01.407]  Babies included.
[03:48:01.847 --> 03:48:05.550]  So Alex, of course, tomorrow he will be back, it sounds like, at 3 p.m.
[03:48:05.610 --> 03:48:08.611]  Central to do an important update on vaccines.
[03:48:09.352 --> 03:48:10.753]  There's some interesting news coming out.
[03:48:10.833 --> 03:48:12.093]  I'll leave all that to Alex, though.
[03:48:12.133 --> 03:48:14.135]  I want to touch on the Mueller report.
[03:48:15.155 --> 03:48:19.558]  Because callers today have been asked, what should President Trump do?
[03:48:20.459 --> 03:48:24.263]  And I too have that question, and I too would love to see something done.
[03:48:24.603 --> 03:48:32.870]  But President Trump did say, or at least his campaign did in a statement yesterday, that it is time to seek justice and get answers.
[03:48:32.890 --> 03:48:35.933]  In other words, it's time to investigate the investigators.
[03:48:36.173 --> 03:48:37.995]  The article is up at bigleaguepolitics.com.
[03:48:39.376 --> 03:48:41.917]  Justice will be served.
[03:48:41.937 --> 03:48:42.697]  We've been covering this.
[03:48:42.717 --> 03:48:45.137]  We've got all kinds of great, fantastic articles up.
[03:48:45.157 --> 03:48:53.059]  We've just got dozens and dozens because unlike the big box journalists, the corporate journalists, we actually read the report and we saw what was in it.
[03:48:53.319 --> 03:48:59.620]  And it was mind-blowing to see some of what came out in that redacted version of the Mueller report.
[03:48:59.640 --> 03:49:06.461]  So, Kayleigh McEnany, who is a member of President Trump's campaign, she's one of the higher-ups, she put out a statement yesterday
[03:49:06.921 --> 03:49:16.285]  Signed by the legendary Brad Parscale, President Trump's campaign manager, saying that it is time to investigate the liars who instigated this sham.
[03:49:16.745 --> 03:49:21.187]  They said, President Trump has been fully and completely exonerated yet again.
[03:49:21.207 --> 03:49:29.311]  And it continues, now the tables have turned and it's time to investigate the liars who instigated the sham investigation.
[03:49:30.391 --> 03:49:34.433]  The statement continued, there is simply no denying that spying did occur.
[03:49:35.017 --> 03:49:36.678]  On the Trump campaign in 2016.
[03:49:37.938 --> 03:49:38.539]  It goes on.
[03:49:38.779 --> 03:49:53.645]  Now that collusion and obstruction conspiracy theories have been exposed for the pathetic hoaxes they always were, the Obama-era Department of Justice and FBI must answer for their misdeeds and the scam they perpetrated against the American people.
[03:49:53.745 --> 03:49:59.188]  And the statement from the Trump campaign concludes, justice will be served.
[03:49:59.668 --> 03:50:05.035]  So of course we're just going to have to wait and see in the coming days, weeks, and months what that looks like.
[03:50:05.415 --> 03:50:15.567]  But now that this is finally behind us, this ridiculous sham, we've been called Russian bots, we've been called corrupted by the Kremlin, all of these horrible things.
[03:50:15.608 --> 03:50:19.132]  We're just years now, two years, longer than that really.
[03:50:19.935 --> 03:50:21.835]  And it's finally over and behind us.
[03:50:21.875 --> 03:50:26.156]  Of course, there are those who refuse to accept reality on the left, just as there always have been.
[03:50:26.176 --> 03:50:27.857]  Hey, communism hasn't been tried.
[03:50:27.877 --> 03:50:29.737]  You just got to do it my way and it'll be perfect.
[03:50:30.357 --> 03:50:40.239]  But there's some other stories about the Mueller report that I haven't seen anybody, except maybe InfoWars, the cutting edge of journalism, really talk about this type of stuff.
[03:50:40.279 --> 03:50:46.481]  Now, the great fallacy, the great lie, is that the Russians just want Trump.
[03:50:46.881 --> 03:50:47.661]  They love Trump.
[03:50:47.921 --> 03:50:50.023]  They think he's great, he's amazing.
[03:50:50.583 --> 03:50:54.567]  And while that's what I believe, that's not what the Russians thought whatsoever.
[03:50:55.187 --> 03:51:02.073]  Russia was doing anything it could to sow discord, to destroy social cohesion in the United States of America.
[03:51:02.374 --> 03:51:05.837]  And that includes supporting Black Lives Matter.
[03:51:06.858 --> 03:51:07.238]  That's right.
[03:51:08.021 --> 03:51:23.116]  Russia had several groups that it created on social media, fake social media pages, called things like Black Matters, Blacktivists, Don't Shoot US, Black Fist, and a corresponding group called Black Matters US.
[03:51:23.940 --> 03:51:30.468]  All over social media, thousands and thousands of followers pushing the Black Lives Matter narrative.
[03:51:30.488 --> 03:51:30.548]  Why?
[03:51:30.788 --> 03:51:32.971]  Because they know that it's nonsensical.
[03:51:33.011 --> 03:51:39.018]  What does Black Lives Matter, what does it do other than result in burning black cities?
[03:51:40.120 --> 03:51:44.684]  And this is a real point of interest to me that we're never going to see investigated.
[03:51:44.724 --> 03:51:48.927]  And of course, Mueller didn't investigate it because it didn't have to do with the big orange man.
[03:51:49.007 --> 03:51:50.969]  As we all know, orange man bad.
[03:51:51.489 --> 03:52:00.496]  One of these groups actually contracted with a self-defense instructor in New York to offer classes sponsored by the fictional Black Fist Group.
[03:52:00.557 --> 03:52:02.358]  Again, this is just a Russian creation.
[03:52:02.678 --> 03:52:05.400]  One of these fake Russian social media accounts.
[03:52:05.621 --> 03:52:09.524]  They actually paid a defense instructor in New York to quote,
[03:52:09.924 --> 03:52:14.927]  Teach African Americans to protect themselves when contacted by law enforcement.
[03:52:15.508 --> 03:52:17.089]  That's all the report has to offer.
[03:52:17.549 --> 03:52:20.411]  Personally, I would like to know, what were they being taught?
[03:52:20.751 --> 03:52:22.552]  Were they being taught not to do this?
[03:52:22.913 --> 03:52:27.576]  Grab for your waistband because that's what makes police officers think that they're reaching for a weapon?
[03:52:28.156 --> 03:52:30.458]  Were they taught to peacefully comply?
[03:52:30.478 --> 03:52:31.658]  Were they taught their rights?
[03:52:31.919 --> 03:52:33.279]  Were they taught to get a lawyer?
[03:52:33.299 --> 03:52:34.800]  Were they taught about the Fourth Amendment?
[03:52:35.101 --> 03:52:38.363]  Or were they taught how to react with violence?
[03:52:39.210 --> 03:52:43.314]  This could be Russia getting people killed, potentially.
[03:52:44.175 --> 03:52:49.100]  But because it didn't have to do with President Trump, we will never get to learn.
[03:52:49.620 --> 03:52:51.522]  And it wasn't just Black Lives Matter.
[03:52:51.542 --> 03:52:53.684]  They weren't just pushing that narrative.
[03:52:53.944 --> 03:52:59.950]  They were also doing whatever they could to push forward the LGBTQIAA++P agenda.
[03:53:03.382 --> 03:53:09.106]  With a group titled, or a Facebook page, I believe it was Facebook, titled LGBT United.
[03:53:09.987 --> 03:53:12.569]  They also were pushing Islam.
[03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:17.733]  With a group titled United Muslims of America.
[03:53:18.654 --> 03:53:22.536]  All of these were created not because Russia cares about gay people.
[03:53:22.837 --> 03:53:27.620]  They have laws on the books in Russia that basically criminalizes being gay in public.
[03:53:28.341 --> 03:53:30.943]  And it's definitely not because they support Muslims.
[03:53:32.136 --> 03:53:35.057]  If that were true, they wouldn't be pushing them out of the country.
[03:53:35.338 --> 03:53:40.080]  Every time there's a terrorist attack in Russia, they respond immediately and with extreme lethality.
[03:53:41.821 --> 03:53:43.982]  So it's not because they support any of these groups.
[03:53:44.002 --> 03:53:45.422]  They don't support Black Lives Matter.
[03:53:45.463 --> 03:53:47.844]  They don't have a Black Lives Matter in Russia.
[03:53:48.064 --> 03:53:48.184]  No!
[03:53:48.865 --> 03:53:53.466]  It's because they want to sow discord and destroy social cohesion in the United States of America.
[03:53:53.486 --> 03:54:03.028]  And if you look around what's happened to Alex Jones and Infowars, Owen Schreier, just the other week, he goes out in public and he gets assaulted by a woman or a man.
[03:54:03.208 --> 03:54:03.668]  I don't know.
[03:54:03.748 --> 03:54:04.768]  They were wearing a dress.
[03:54:05.009 --> 03:54:06.389]  I don't know what they call themselves.
[03:54:06.789 --> 03:54:16.111]  You can never tell the pronouns these days, but not only did they push these groups, Black Lives Matter, LGBT, and Islam,
[03:54:16.857 --> 03:54:18.757]  They pushed Bernie Sanders!
[03:54:19.458 --> 03:54:19.898]  That's right.
[03:54:20.058 --> 03:54:22.998]  Comrade Sanders is a Russian plant, apparently.
[03:54:23.058 --> 03:54:25.299]  If we apply the same logic they apply to Trump.
[03:54:25.819 --> 03:54:29.540]  Bernie Sanders, it is revealed, the Mueller Report, they supported him.
[03:54:29.560 --> 03:54:31.600]  And of course, you think CNN's gonna cover that?
[03:54:32.221 --> 03:54:33.821]  I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.
[03:54:33.861 --> 03:54:35.001]  You just might pass out.
[03:54:35.561 --> 03:54:39.202]  So, the quote is, from the Mueller Report, the main idea is this.
[03:54:39.782 --> 03:54:45.344]  Use opportunities to criticize Hillary Clinton and the rest, except Sanders and Trump.
[03:54:45.424 --> 03:54:46.524]  We support them.
[03:54:47.276 --> 03:54:53.843]  And if you look at it in kind of a Machiavellian, almost even Orwellian sense, this is the best way to destroy America.
[03:54:54.363 --> 03:55:10.639]  You put the guy who is perceived as far-right, and the guy who is perceived as far-left, in these far-left groups, again the Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ, and Islam, and you use that because the average American who's somewhere in the middle, that have now been pushed to the right thanks to the left,
[03:55:12.018 --> 03:55:13.499]  It makes us all at each other's throats.
[03:55:13.879 --> 03:55:21.344]  You can't walk out in public in a major city with a Trump hat anymore, or you risk being harmed physically for your political beliefs.
[03:55:22.264 --> 03:55:28.388]  You know, these Russians, they have to be patting themselves on the back with all this, because they did one hell of a great job.
[03:55:28.788 --> 03:55:33.351]  I wish we had government offices that were half as efficient as these Russians.
[03:55:33.911 --> 03:55:34.451]  Who knows?
[03:55:34.511 --> 03:55:40.775]  We could go beyond the stars, as Alex Jones says, if the government was as efficient as these Russian hackers.
[03:55:41.539 --> 03:55:49.325]  And of course, the final big one is this all goes back not to June 16th, 2015 when President Trump tossed his hat in the ring.
[03:55:49.385 --> 03:55:49.626]  No!
[03:55:50.086 --> 03:55:51.908]  It goes back to 2014!
[03:55:52.328 --> 03:55:55.390]  They've been doing this since 2014, so it all makes sense now.
[03:55:55.791 --> 03:55:58.353]  Gamergate was nothing but the Russians.
[03:55:58.433 --> 03:56:00.194]  Clearly, that's what this must mean.
[03:56:00.775 --> 03:56:03.357]  So all this happened right under Obama's nose.
[03:56:03.957 --> 03:56:09.302]  We now pretty much know, not for certain, but everybody pretty much understands that he must have known about this.
[03:56:10.427 --> 03:56:11.808]  He must have allowed it to continue.
[03:56:12.108 --> 03:56:25.032]  He must have known that in 2014, he had people who are essentially Russian spies coming to the United States under false pretenses on information gathering missions, which they would then use to create their social media pages.
[03:56:25.413 --> 03:56:26.153]  He must have known.
[03:56:26.933 --> 03:56:34.456]  Again, President Trump is saying that the Obama-era FBI, the Obama-era DOJ, they are going to have to answer questions.
[03:56:35.003 --> 03:56:37.644]  About this absolute insanity.
[03:56:37.664 --> 03:56:40.725]  So we're starting to wind down here at the Alex Jones Show.
[03:56:40.745 --> 03:56:44.386]  I want to remind everybody coming up next is War Room with Owen Schroer.
[03:56:44.406 --> 03:56:50.448]  If you haven't watched that in the past year, you owe it to yourself because Owen gets better and better and better every day.
[03:56:50.828 --> 03:56:56.950]  And I do want to remind everybody as well, there are some awesome sales right now on Infowarestore.com.
[03:56:57.290 --> 03:57:00.492]  I believe when I looked earlier, all t-shirts are 50% off.
[03:57:00.512 --> 03:57:04.473]  You can save $50 on the Alexa Pure Breeze
[03:57:05.033 --> 03:57:08.776]  Air filtration, which is an unbelievable life changer to me.
[03:57:09.116 --> 03:57:10.417]  I used to get sick every winter.
[03:57:10.537 --> 03:57:12.739]  Ever since I got my Alexa Pure, I'm fine.
[03:57:13.059 --> 03:57:15.601]  Of course, there's also the old standards.
[03:57:15.781 --> 03:57:16.381]  I love this.
[03:57:16.501 --> 03:57:17.502]  I love Alpha Power.
[03:57:17.682 --> 03:57:18.242]  I love X2.
[03:57:18.282 --> 03:57:20.864]  You can get it all at infowarsstore.com.
[03:57:21.445 --> 03:57:21.825]  And really,
[03:57:23.169 --> 03:57:28.293]  Alex says it enough, but this Infowar, we're cut off from all of the globalist systems.
[03:57:28.713 --> 03:57:30.675]  Alex Jones is more than anybody else, potentially.
[03:57:31.035 --> 03:57:35.539]  And so we need the support of individual patriots like you to make all of this happen.
[03:57:35.799 --> 03:57:41.483]  To give poor people like me, who are just coming up in all this insanity, the opportunity to get his name out there.
[03:57:41.543 --> 03:57:43.025]  So again, thank you to Alex Jones.
[03:57:43.325 --> 03:57:45.527]  Thank you to the crew for doing a phenomenal job.
[03:57:45.827 --> 03:57:47.368]  I am Tom Hafford.
[03:57:47.388 --> 03:57:49.450]  You can find me on Facebook on God, Emperor Trump.
[03:57:49.530 --> 03:57:51.131]  I'll be live again tonight at 8pm.
[03:57:51.451 --> 03:57:52.132]  Thanks for watching.
[03:57:53.533 --> 03:58:02.443]  Let me just tell listeners about something that is the very best product for your telomeres, for your mitochondrial DNA, that's the antioxidant that's next level.
[03:58:02.624 --> 03:58:11.454]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, the amount of it in here, depending on the equation, something like 40 boxes of the same chemical that's naturally occurring in blueberries.
[03:58:11.614 --> 03:58:12.335]  It's ridiculous.
[03:58:12.455 --> 03:58:13.996]  The CoQ10 PPQ.
[03:58:14.136 --> 03:58:17.397]  We have the organically derived, and by that, it's not synthetic.
[03:58:17.657 --> 03:58:23.040]  Most of the stuff that you see on the shelves, a tiny bottle of PQQ or CoQ10, it'll be like 50 bucks, because even the synthetic's expensive.
[03:58:23.160 --> 03:58:25.281]  This is the organically derived.
[03:58:25.681 --> 03:58:26.581]  This is the real stuff.
[03:58:26.781 --> 03:58:38.206]  I want to warn you, though, when I first started taking it five years ago, this is DNA Force Plus, when I cut my finger off, like, 15 years ago, they reattached the finger, and you can see that right there, where it cut off, it was hanging by a piece of skin right here.
[03:58:38.226 --> 03:58:39.927]  It doesn't cut cleanly like you see in the movies.
[03:58:40.627 --> 03:58:41.348]  Then it tore it off.
[03:58:41.628 --> 03:58:43.070]  It was numb all the way up here.
[03:58:43.210 --> 03:58:45.352]  And the strangest thing is I started taking DNA force.
[03:58:45.572 --> 03:58:47.114]  The feeling came back in my finger.
[03:58:47.174 --> 03:58:48.656]  First it tingled and it came back.
[03:58:48.856 --> 03:58:49.937]  I was like, this is incredible.
[03:58:49.997 --> 03:58:50.818]  But I'm going to warn you.
[03:58:51.018 --> 03:58:55.563]  Most people that have old injuries and where nerves have kind of died out, this isn't just regenerating your cells.
[03:58:55.743 --> 03:58:59.467]  This is just slowing the shrinkage of telomeres, which is the same thing as making them last longer.
