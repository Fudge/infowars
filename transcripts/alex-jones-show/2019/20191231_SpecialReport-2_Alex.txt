[00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:17.681]  The globalists are desperate to derail Donald Trump's already successful foreign policy of pulling our troops out of the Middle East and focusing more on China and their expansion in the South China Sea.
[00:00:18.482 --> 00:00:19.743]  Now, the U.S.
[00:00:19.863 --> 00:00:24.045]  Embassy got attacked by Iranian-backed militias.
[00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:30.229]  Hezbollah, in the last 24 hours, overran a lot of the Green Zone Embassy.
[00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.712]  And CNN and others are traitorously, as usual, calling them protesters.
[00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:39.854]  Protesters that are burning and attacking people.
[00:00:40.254 --> 00:00:43.196]  The first line of Iraqi police that guard the embassy
[00:00:43.456 --> 00:00:45.497]  History is repeating itself.
[00:00:45.537 --> 00:00:54.441]  The CIA, or elements of it, in 1979 actually backed the Ayatollah Khomeini coming in and taking over from the Shah because he wasn't taking orders from the West.
[00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:15.274]  Now, once they got in, they double-crossed the West and overthrew the U.S.
[00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:18.057]  Embassy in Tehran, taking hostages.
[00:01:18.517 --> 00:01:20.299]  Then, that embarrassed Jimmy Carter.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.005]  He had a failed Delta Force raid, and that was credited with getting Ronald Reagan in, in 1980.
[00:01:26.462 --> 00:01:32.425]  This is just like what happened in 1979 to Carter, and it's just like what happened with the Bay of Pigs.
[00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:37.928]  All of this is being done by internal units and groups within the State Department, still run by Soros.
[00:01:37.968 --> 00:01:41.469]  That's why we focus on people like Fiona Hill, McMaster, and others.
[00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:50.034]  Their subordinates, their adjuncts, their attachÃ©s are still in the State Department and are constantly rigging things like this.
[00:01:50.054 --> 00:01:50.574]  That's why Trump
[00:01:50.674 --> 00:01:56.198]  Globalism is about sabotaging Western systems and then having a corporate system outside of that that controls the planet.
[00:01:56.218 --> 00:01:57.619]  This is a big deal for Trump.
[00:02:19.134 --> 00:02:25.736]  He needs to come out, he needs to sack this ambassador, or he needs to find out exactly what's happened and punish whoever stood down.
[00:02:25.996 --> 00:02:33.538]  This is a real show of weakness to let these people overrun the embassy, engage in this type of terrorist activity, and not be responded to.
[00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:34.318]  That is U.S.
[00:02:34.358 --> 00:02:43.260]  soil like your home being stormed by people with weapons, people with knives, people burning things, assaulting, reportedly killing people, and it's being called protest.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.421]  Now finally, Iraqi military from outside the base came in
[00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:47.622]  We're good to go.
[00:03:09.861 --> 00:03:10.061]  I'm good.
[00:03:25.918 --> 00:03:27.159]  Absolute outright treason.
[00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:34.324]  In closing, we won't be on the air to counter the Globalist's talking points unless you spread the word about the broadcast and unless you buy the products.
[00:03:34.404 --> 00:03:37.986]  And right now is the end of 2019, end of 2020.
[00:03:38.787 --> 00:03:43.050]  For the next week only, it's the biggest sale to sell out of everything in the New Year's.

[00:04:05.714 --> 00:04:06.735]  My second cup of the day.
[00:04:06.855 --> 00:04:07.716]  It's really strong.
[00:04:07.756 --> 00:04:08.516]  I shouldn't do this.
[00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:11.719]  Because all work and no play makes Jack a really aggressive boy.
[00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.060]  And the coffee adds to it, but mmm.

[00:04:22.487 --> 00:04:23.408]  Hand selected.
[00:04:23.448 --> 00:04:24.308]  It's beyond organic.
[00:04:24.388 --> 00:04:25.069]  Wild crafted.
[00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.650]  Wake Up America Coffee.
