[00:00:10.673 --> 00:00:19.596]  I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you wanna fight, you better believe you got one!
[00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:26.159]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.664 --> 00:00:44.625]  Adrenochrome.
[00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:46.206]  Adrenochrome?
[00:00:46.586 --> 00:00:46.866]  Hmm.
[00:00:47.727 --> 00:00:49.067]  Whoa!
[00:00:49.087 --> 00:00:59.874]  Adrenochrome first hit pop culture in 1971, when gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson wrote about it in his book, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
[00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:07.939]  He wrote that his lawyer, Oscar Acosta, was defending a Satanist who was charged with molesting a child.
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.942]  The Satanist client paid his lawyer with adrenochrome,
[00:01:14.995 --> 00:01:19.638]  And claim the only source was the adrenaline glands from a living human body.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:32.327]  If you search Google for adrenochrome, the Google-supported result is from the conspiracy wiki, which suggests that it is all merely fantasy.
[00:01:33.868 --> 00:01:37.691]  But just to the right, you will find that adrenochrome is real.
[00:01:39.013 --> 00:01:46.136]  According to scientific research, adrenochrome is formed by the oxidation of its precursor, adrenaline.
[00:01:47.976 --> 00:01:53.998]  Adrenaline is the active hormone from the adrenal medulla, otherwise known as epinephrine.
[00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.121]  EpiPens are auto-injectors that contain synthetic adrenaline.
[00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:03.382]  Developed by the U.S.
[00:02:03.482 --> 00:02:06.883]  military to protect soldiers in the event of chemical warfare,
[00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:11.247]  EpiPens are used to treat extreme allergic reactions.
[00:02:13.228 --> 00:02:16.610]  EpiPens only have a shelf life of about 18 months.
[00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:27.397]  According to the manufacturer, after 18 months, the oxidation process begins and the EpiPens are turned into adrenochrome.
[00:02:30.527 --> 00:02:39.350]  Interestingly, both companies that manufacture the EpiPen, Mylon and Kaleo, are connected to the Clinton Foundation.
[00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.311]  Ambrosia, a controversial new startup company, was recently charging $8,000 to fill your veins with the blood of young people.
[00:02:54.546 --> 00:03:05.915]  Founder and CEO, Dr. Jesse Karmazin, who claims it will give you superhuman powers, has recently ceased patient treatments due to a recent FDA warning.
[00:03:07.917 --> 00:03:17.325]  In Greek mythology, ambrosia means immortality and was the food of the gods that gave longevity or immortality to whoever consumed it.
[00:03:19.626 --> 00:03:23.750]  It is believed by many researchers to represent the blood of the young.
[00:03:26.016 --> 00:03:32.560]  The cosmetic industry has been using aborted fetal tissues in various anti-aging skincare products.
[00:03:34.982 --> 00:03:40.346]  The taboo culture of consuming the young seems to go back through all of human history.
[00:03:41.967 --> 00:03:45.209]  But now, it seems to be coming out into the open.
[00:03:47.242 --> 00:03:49.844]  Democrats are pushing for full-term abortions.
[00:03:50.604 --> 00:03:52.585]  The infant would be delivered.
[00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:54.706]  The infant would be kept comfortable.
[00:03:55.087 --> 00:03:59.889]  The infant would be resuscitated, if that's what the mother and the family desired.
[00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.132]  And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mothers.
[00:04:04.492 --> 00:04:08.434]  And telling us that the future is too grim for us to think about raising a family.
[00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:13.697]  There's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult.
[00:04:14.478 --> 00:04:16.299]  Is it okay to still have children?
[00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:20.460]  How far is this going to go before humanity has enough?
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:28.403]  For NewsWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:31.144 --> 00:04:32.024]  InfoWars.com.
[00:04:32.685 --> 00:04:33.945]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:04:35.737 --> 00:04:40.200]  We're building a pro-human future for the stars and beyond.
[00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.722]  We're building the new human for millennium.
[00:04:43.802 --> 00:04:45.483]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:04:46.284 --> 00:04:46.624]  All right.
[00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:52.788]  This is going to be a magnificent transmission today.
[00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:55.050]  Magnificent.
[00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:58.032]  Ha ha!
[00:04:58.052 --> 00:04:58.812]  So, just get ready.
[00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:01.174]  A lot is coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:02.735]  But I thought we'd kick off with that report.
[00:05:06.801 --> 00:05:08.081]  Here's to the crazy ones.
[00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:10.242]  The misfits.
[00:05:11.063 --> 00:05:11.543]  The rebels.
[00:05:12.883 --> 00:05:13.643]  The troublemakers.
[00:05:14.904 --> 00:05:16.725]  The round pegs in the square holes.
[00:05:16.925 --> 00:05:21.266]  The ones who see things differently.
[00:05:21.286 --> 00:05:26.988]  They're not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo.
[00:05:27.068 --> 00:05:31.850]  You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them,
[00:05:32.734 --> 00:05:35.556]  About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.
[00:05:36.997 --> 00:05:42.081]  And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
[00:05:43.762 --> 00:05:50.587]  Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.
[00:06:08.504 --> 00:06:09.905]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:10.225 --> 00:06:24.311]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:24.731 --> 00:06:35.096]  I told you last week, on Friday, that the FBI wasn't just investigating Jesse Smollett for wire fraud for his fraudulent letter.
[00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:37.577]  No, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:43.271]  I told you that they were investigating Smollett being directed by people above him.
[00:06:44.091 --> 00:07:05.755]  And what came out in the news yesterday, that the folks heading up the show were strangely enough, not just one, not just two, but three different people on the show, claimed hate crimes happened to them or happened to their families, and then strangely enough had written screenplays or short stories previously of the exact same thing happening.
[00:07:07.711 --> 00:07:11.232]  So later in the broadcast, I'm going to get to that, because it was in my stack yesterday.
[00:07:11.313 --> 00:07:12.073]  I didn't get to it.
[00:07:12.093 --> 00:07:13.233]  And I just remembered it.
[00:07:13.293 --> 00:07:17.715]  So I put that middle note so we can re-pull it out of yesterday's stack, because that's pretty big news.
[00:07:18.616 --> 00:07:19.356]  And we never got to it.
[00:07:20.416 --> 00:07:22.177]  So it's usually tomorrow's news today.
[00:07:22.217 --> 00:07:25.058]  And of course, this news is next week's news today.
[00:07:25.138 --> 00:07:28.960]  But then sometimes it becomes yesterday's news because I dropped the ball.
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.300]  See how that works?
[00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:33.242]  Amazing.
[00:07:34.242 --> 00:07:34.702]  Amazing.
[00:07:34.862 --> 00:07:35.002]  Yep.
[00:07:35.082 --> 00:07:36.463]  There's a last last
[00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:43.273]  Last week, and now Fox News and others are reporting on it.
[00:07:43.293 --> 00:07:45.514]  Okay, let me stop right there.
[00:07:47.555 --> 00:07:49.296]  I just interviewed Tommy Robinson.
[00:07:50.077 --> 00:07:58.782]  I don't usually tape interviews, but he had to take care of his son and one of his friends that were coming over for a little barbecue at the house.
[00:07:59.983 --> 00:08:03.425]  And so I taped the interview with him, but we're going to air it.
[00:08:04.542 --> 00:08:23.530]  In the third hour, and it is the most powerful Tommy Robinson interview ever because they got undercover video and audio over the last year of MI5, MI6, working with George Soros to frame him for sex crimes.
[00:08:24.751 --> 00:08:31.494]  Of course, he exposes the mass Muslim kidnapping rings, delivering the young girls to the British aristocracy, in some cases for murder.
[00:08:33.046 --> 00:08:35.207]  I mean, the guy's an absolute folk hero.
[00:08:35.587 --> 00:08:36.448]  In prison repeatedly.
[00:08:36.508 --> 00:08:37.428]  First guy to ever break it.
[00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:47.674]  Uh, you know, he's like... 5'5", and, you know, takes on four or five guys that are 6'2", 6'1", and, you know, kicks their ass.
[00:08:48.014 --> 00:08:48.815]  He's the real deal.
[00:08:48.855 --> 00:08:50.015]  He's David versus Goliath.
[00:08:50.816 --> 00:08:55.058]  And... They are gonna have to destroy him.
[00:08:55.358 --> 00:08:56.159]  But here's the good news.
[00:08:58.238 --> 00:09:00.739]  They miscalculated ultra massively.
[00:09:01.459 --> 00:09:05.039]  Now he got banned from Instagram and Facebook and a bunch of other places last night for the film.
[00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:09.500]  The first salvo in two others that are about to come out that are going to premiere here.
[00:09:12.441 --> 00:09:21.722]  Where they're on tape saying we're going to frame him for sex crimes and saying let's stage stuff that he supposedly did to you.
[00:09:23.023 --> 00:09:25.063]  And then we're going to say that the videos from him.
[00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:41.809]  I mean, you're talking the BBC, working with Hope Not Hate, that's publicly a subsidiary of Soros, the equivalent of Media Matters here, engaged in hard-core criminal activity.
[00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.052]  Now, the video's been pulled off of Instagram and Facebook.
[00:09:46.072 --> 00:09:48.034]  We're at a million and a half views.
[00:09:48.094 --> 00:09:49.875]  It has 170-something thousand views on YouTube.
[00:09:49.995 --> 00:09:51.036]  It will get taken down.
[00:09:52.957 --> 00:09:53.938]  We're going to upload it.
[00:09:55.402 --> 00:09:57.323]  With the taped interview we just did.
[00:09:58.843 --> 00:10:04.645]  So the crew was asking me, right as we went live, because I ended the interview with Tommy 30 seconds before we went live.
[00:10:05.065 --> 00:10:06.085]  So they said, what's your directive?
[00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:07.105]  I said, give me a minute.
[00:10:08.226 --> 00:10:09.186]  Crew did an amazing job.
[00:10:09.446 --> 00:10:10.746]  Take the interview with Tommy.
[00:10:10.786 --> 00:10:12.247]  Let's not even wait till the third hour.
[00:10:13.027 --> 00:10:14.067]  Take the interview with Tommy.
[00:10:15.308 --> 00:10:19.289]  Clip it on the front of the film.
[00:10:23.183 --> 00:10:28.834]  The censored film, and then we'll post that to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com on our own servers.
[00:10:29.155 --> 00:10:34.264]  Because that's why we built this, it's why I knew this was coming for a long time, it's why we've got a lot of tricks up our sleeves.
[00:10:37.168 --> 00:10:38.748]  Truth is our only weapon, I will tell you.
[00:10:38.788 --> 00:10:42.809]  We've got a lot of dug-in emplacements in the Infowar.
[00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:49.231]  But the enemy has turned loose intelligence agencies, which you're going to see in this film, and it's admitted.
[00:10:50.051 --> 00:10:51.111]  And it's bipartisan.
[00:10:51.131 --> 00:10:56.293]  The neocons and the Democrats are working together, and they have turned the Central Intelligence Agency loose on me.
[00:10:57.093 --> 00:10:58.973]  They have turned the FBI loose on us.
[00:10:59.514 --> 00:11:05.195]  And I'm just a loyal, hard-working American at my post, fighting.
[00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:08.403]  But I cannot stress to you how epic this is.
[00:11:08.443 --> 00:11:09.424]  Now, here's the good news.
[00:11:10.104 --> 00:11:19.632]  The average real person in the CIA that actually goes after bad guys and fights real evil people, because it has that arm, is a total listener and loves us.
[00:11:20.193 --> 00:11:22.155]  The average FBI agent absolutely loves us.
[00:11:22.435 --> 00:11:25.518]  I don't want to get into details, but it's ridiculous.
[00:11:26.158 --> 00:11:26.398]  Okay?
[00:11:27.293 --> 00:11:30.594]  I mean, I run into federal marshals, FBI, customs people.
[00:11:31.855 --> 00:11:34.276]  They're just opening doors for me and have tears in their eyes.
[00:11:34.936 --> 00:11:37.918]  Border Patrol, you know, these are good, hard-working people, very race, color, and creed.
[00:11:38.278 --> 00:11:38.998]  They know what's going on.
[00:11:39.578 --> 00:11:43.740]  And they know the higher-ups are a bunch of damn crooks, and they know Trump's trying to turn this around.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:52.324]  But let me tell you, for at least 25 years, they have been on purpose putting people like Reality Winner.
[00:11:53.146 --> 00:11:56.268]  All this crazy SJW stuff you see suddenly everywhere on the streets.
[00:11:56.328 --> 00:12:00.672]  It's been breeding and preparing and gearing up like Mordor's army.
[00:12:01.472 --> 00:12:03.954]  Like the Nazi army in 1939.
[00:12:04.054 --> 00:12:10.099]  It has just spilled out like a cell busting open and releasing millions of viruses.
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.041]  That's this offensive you're saying.
[00:12:13.801 --> 00:12:16.483]  And Trump and nationalism around the world is the counter offenses.
[00:12:17.344 --> 00:12:18.485]  But it's desperate.
[00:12:19.434 --> 00:12:20.094]  Reality winner.
[00:12:20.795 --> 00:12:21.936]  Change her name to reality winner.
[00:12:22.016 --> 00:12:24.918]  She was blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl who said whites should be exterminated.
[00:12:25.438 --> 00:12:26.559]  She tried to join ISIS.
[00:12:26.919 --> 00:12:29.721]  She had a top security clearance at the FBI.
[00:12:31.582 --> 00:12:35.985]  And she was leaking all the info to ISIS and the leftist groups.
[00:12:36.706 --> 00:12:38.387]  These are mental patients.
[00:12:39.748 --> 00:12:40.868]  And I'd say a good
[00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:45.340]  30% of the government is now hardcore reality winners.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:50.764]  Like this guy they just busted that gave Avenatti the illegal IRS files on Cohen.
[00:12:53.085 --> 00:12:54.967]  And he's a hardcore Bernie Sanders supporter.
[00:12:56.608 --> 00:12:58.830]  And believes that whites are evil even though he's white.
[00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.811]  These are mental patients.
[00:13:01.392 --> 00:13:04.134]  These are Stockholm Syndrome people under the globalist control.
[00:13:05.295 --> 00:13:09.238]  These are followers taken down
[00:13:10.506 --> 00:13:12.267]  To a level of brainwashed slaves.
[00:13:17.208 --> 00:13:20.009]  So, this is the threshold we stand at.
[00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:22.150]  So, I think we can beat Reality Winner.
[00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.030]  I think we can beat Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.411]  We've got to be willing to die.
[00:13:26.111 --> 00:13:33.013]  You've got to be willing for Hillary Clinton to send a hit team in to put a fast-acting heart attack agent on your toothbrush.
[00:13:33.093 --> 00:13:34.913]  It's the most common way of doing it.
[00:13:35.254 --> 00:13:36.414]  Or you have a kayaking accident.
[00:13:36.994 --> 00:13:37.394]  You know what?
[00:13:37.475 --> 00:13:38.455]  I'm not worried about that.
[00:13:38.536 --> 00:13:38.976]  I don't want to die.
[00:13:38.996 --> 00:13:39.937]  I'll never commit suicide.
[00:13:40.377 --> 00:13:43.340]  But I'm worried about the devil worship, the pedophilia, the evil.
[00:13:44.101 --> 00:13:47.885]  And so as a man, I am honored to be targeted.
[00:13:48.465 --> 00:13:49.046]  But here's the thing.
[00:13:49.506 --> 00:13:57.454]  I want to fight with every ounce of my energy and every ounce of my focused
[00:14:00.831 --> 00:14:02.412]  Love for the innocents.
[00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:07.974]  Because I tend to get into hatred of the globalists, and that is a dark force in the end, and only brings us down.
[00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:09.635]  We need to do it for the children.
[00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:11.176]  We need to do it for the innocents.
[00:14:11.196 --> 00:14:12.016]  We need to do it for the truth.
[00:14:12.316 --> 00:14:14.637]  We need to do it because that is what God wants us to do.
[00:14:16.418 --> 00:14:17.318]  We have to be the souls of the earth.
[00:14:18.659 --> 00:14:26.182]  And so, Mankal Muller is going to be popping in on the show, and in the fourth hour, we're going to air his podcast, in its entirety, his first podcast.
[00:14:26.202 --> 00:14:28.263]  He's been retired for a year, came back out of retirement.
[00:14:28.723 --> 00:14:30.064]  Big syndicated talk show, he's a good friend of mine.
[00:14:31.926 --> 00:14:33.847]  But he said it moved his whole crew to tears.
[00:14:33.867 --> 00:14:35.428]  I've known Mankal 15, 16 years.
[00:14:35.468 --> 00:14:36.308]  He's never talked like this.
[00:14:37.589 --> 00:14:45.372]  He said that everybody that's listening to the podcast was totally and completely blown away by it.
[00:14:49.794 --> 00:14:56.317]  And we're going to be airing it coming up in the fourth hour.
[00:14:57.198 --> 00:14:58.498]  And I was just standing there in the kitchen.
[00:14:58.518 --> 00:14:59.759]  It was supposed to be a 10-minute interview.
[00:15:00.939 --> 00:15:08.381]  I ended up doing an hour on his radio show and not working out that morning, and then I did 45 minutes of his podcast after that.
[00:15:08.881 --> 00:15:11.281]  Ended up barely making it to work that day, but I thought it was important to do.
[00:15:11.881 --> 00:15:13.802]  And we really get into what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole.
[00:15:14.802 --> 00:15:24.424]  So you want hardcore what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole that had, by the end of it, because it doesn't start that powerful, by the end of the uninterrupted 40-something minutes,
[00:15:26.261 --> 00:15:29.924]  It shakes everyone that hears it, and everyone knows it's true.
[00:15:30.384 --> 00:15:32.645]  And it's pure Veritas.
[00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:35.767]  So that's going to be in the fourth hour.
[00:15:36.328 --> 00:15:39.990]  Tommy Robinson, and we've blown them wide open in their whole criminal operation.
[00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:46.034]  Also, we've got so many other big guests.
[00:15:46.234 --> 00:15:48.416]  Caitlin Bennett's knocked out of the park yet again.

[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.723]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.207 --> 00:20:28.369]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:30.551]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:42.978 --> 00:20:50.482]  Panodrama is the film seen over a million and a half times since it went up yesterday on Instagram and Facebook.
[00:20:52.063 --> 00:20:54.986]  It's BBC quality video.
[00:20:55.006 --> 00:21:01.972]  It's a documentary showing the BBC trying to frame Tommy Robinson for criminal actions.
[00:21:04.194 --> 00:21:09.739]  And saying they're planning on framing him so he can be sent to prison.
[00:21:12.501 --> 00:21:15.844]  That's who these people are.
[00:21:17.846 --> 00:21:18.767]  They have no bottom.
[00:21:20.834 --> 00:21:22.715]  They'll do anything.
[00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:24.296]  Remember?
[00:21:26.056 --> 00:21:34.921]  Out of the five women that accused Kavanaugh, all of them except one have admitted it was fake.
[00:21:35.321 --> 00:21:36.481]  And one has been indicted.
[00:21:36.521 --> 00:21:38.022]  We ought to check and see where that's going.
[00:21:39.523 --> 00:21:41.183]  And she said, well, he's a bad guy.
[00:21:41.203 --> 00:21:44.165]  And I wanted to support Balazi Ford.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:50.502]  Who was the most disingenuous lying witch I've ever seen in my life.
[00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:56.104]  I mean, I wouldn't believe her if she said the sky was blue.
[00:21:58.885 --> 00:22:00.046]  None of her stories checked out.
[00:22:00.066 --> 00:22:00.766]  It was all lies.
[00:22:01.326 --> 00:22:09.970]  But when you experience people whole cloth lying, it's incredible.
[00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.691]  You know, they say I whole cloth lie.
[00:22:13.271 --> 00:22:15.292]  No, sometimes I get things wrong.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.661]  And when I get them wrong, I tell you, because I want to have credibility.
[00:22:19.821 --> 00:22:20.601]  I want to be right.
[00:22:23.522 --> 00:22:26.043]  And especially as I get older, I used to have a photographic memory.
[00:22:26.063 --> 00:22:28.264]  It's still decent, but I conflate things, I mix things.
[00:22:28.524 --> 00:22:30.144]  So I'm always like, pull this up, let me check that.
[00:22:30.464 --> 00:22:37.987]  Because even though I know it, it's a couple years old, sometimes I can kind of attribute something to somebody else when it was somebody else because they look the same or their name's similar.
[00:22:38.207 --> 00:22:41.788]  You know how that works, but I'm trying to tell you the truth with everything I got!
[00:22:45.097 --> 00:22:50.742]  And that's why they're always trying to undermine me, and say Jones doesn't really mean it.
[00:22:51.983 --> 00:22:53.324]  Jones does it for the money.
[00:22:54.385 --> 00:22:54.966]  The money?
[00:22:57.228 --> 00:23:04.154]  Back when I was making $300,000 a year, gross, and living in a very blue-collar house,
[00:23:06.317 --> 00:23:16.304]  I was putting 95% of the money back into InfoWars and I was offered millions a year, the contract, the book deals, the TV shows, everything.
[00:23:20.427 --> 00:23:24.850]  By the time I was bringing in a couple million a year gross and building the operation, they didn't know.
[00:23:25.831 --> 00:23:27.792]  They offered me $10,000,000.
[00:23:28.913 --> 00:23:32.135]  That's not $10,000,000 worth of supplements you sell.
[00:23:32.875 --> 00:23:38.218]  So it's really $5,000,000, and then you have to fund all the operations, the advertising, the staff, the band with the crew.
[00:23:38.579 --> 00:23:42.821]  And so you've got $1,000,000, and you put that back in to build the operation.
[00:23:44.702 --> 00:23:45.162]  No, no, that's $10,000,000!
[00:23:45.503 --> 00:23:52.607]  And you move to New York, or you move to L.A., and you get the trophy wife.
[00:23:55.933 --> 00:23:57.394]  And you're part of the power structure.
[00:23:57.594 --> 00:23:58.934]  No thank you.
[00:23:59.375 --> 00:24:02.876]  I mean, it's not like it's even tempting to be sold out.
[00:24:03.757 --> 00:24:16.342]  The soullessness, the emptiness at those tables with those executives and their trophy wives, who on three separate occasions tried to have sex with me.
[00:24:16.982 --> 00:24:17.863]  Hey, you like my wife?
[00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:25.890]  Oh, that's another story I forgot.
[00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:30.151]  I didn't just have Hollywood producers three times grab my testicles.
[00:24:30.471 --> 00:24:31.191]  And see, I'm not a victim.
[00:24:31.211 --> 00:24:33.972]  I thought it was weird, and two of the times, threatened to kick their ass.
[00:24:34.292 --> 00:24:36.312]  The other time, I was so shocked, because I admired the person.
[00:24:36.332 --> 00:24:38.292]  I was like, what the hell's your problem?
[00:24:38.552 --> 00:24:41.233]  And he was dying of cancer at the time, so I didn't make a big deal out of it.
[00:24:48.554 --> 00:24:50.775]  It's all about power with these people, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:52.535 --> 00:24:53.395]  It's all about power.
[00:24:55.509 --> 00:24:57.050]  And I was married, too.
[00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.710]  I mean, the woman was good-looking.
[00:24:59.511 --> 00:25:00.531]  Women were really hot.
[00:25:00.651 --> 00:25:02.372]  I mean, if I wasn't married, I probably would have jumped on it.
[00:25:02.692 --> 00:25:04.273]  But I wasn't going to sit there.
[00:25:04.293 --> 00:25:04.973]  Yeah, I'm worldly.
[00:25:04.993 --> 00:25:05.393]  I'll admit it.
[00:25:05.433 --> 00:25:06.153]  I'm of the flesh.
[00:25:06.213 --> 00:25:06.693]  I like women.
[00:25:08.394 --> 00:25:09.975]  Kind of like Cavanaugh said, I like beer.
[00:25:10.215 --> 00:25:11.075]  Well, I like women.
[00:25:12.096 --> 00:25:14.357]  God, I appreciate God making them.
[00:25:14.397 --> 00:25:15.297]  Anyways, side issue.
[00:25:15.657 --> 00:25:19.038]  What I'm getting at here is that I'm not a fake.
[00:25:19.058 --> 00:25:20.099]  I don't want to be around fakes.
[00:25:20.459 --> 00:25:22.640]  And those people are total mummies.
[00:25:24.807 --> 00:25:25.588]  They're mummies!
[00:25:26.428 --> 00:25:27.149]  They're not happy.
[00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:28.650]  There's an emptiness around them.
[00:25:33.073 --> 00:25:45.322]  But if you're in the middle of nowhere in Oklahoma, and you walk into some little gas station to buy some minnows, because you're going to go fishing in a local lake, and there's an old black lady behind the counter,
[00:25:46.497 --> 00:25:51.239]  And her daughter's over there making hamburgers with Daddy, who's whistling and happy.
[00:25:51.899 --> 00:25:54.780]  And they're whistling gospel tunes.
[00:25:55.461 --> 00:25:57.041]  Those people, you can feel the energy.
[00:25:57.061 --> 00:25:58.182]  You can feel the soul.
[00:25:58.582 --> 00:26:01.563]  You can feel the goodness, the completion, the happiness.
[00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:07.904]  And it feels like you're at home, just like if it's white family behind the counter.
[00:26:08.105 --> 00:26:08.505]  Christians.
[00:26:09.345 --> 00:26:10.086]  It's the same people.
[00:26:10.146 --> 00:26:12.748]  Their skin color's different, but they've got God.
[00:26:13.208 --> 00:26:15.770]  They don't need all the money, the power, any of it.
[00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:19.073]  They're happy where they are at their little church and their little life.
[00:26:19.393 --> 00:26:23.096]  And they can walk by the graveyard and say, great granddaddy's right over there.
[00:26:26.399 --> 00:26:28.020]  They've got their souls.
[00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:30.562]  I want to be with them.
[00:26:32.628 --> 00:26:34.648]  And that's why the globalists hate flyover country.
[00:26:36.489 --> 00:26:39.149]  That's why they try to infect it with meth and all the drugs.
[00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:44.091]  That's why they, because they can't stand the fact that you're out there breathing clean air.
[00:26:44.831 --> 00:26:47.791]  They can't stand the fact that you're out there fishing in the creek.
[00:26:49.172 --> 00:26:51.972]  They can't stand the fact that you're satisfied driving your old truck.
[00:26:51.992 --> 00:26:54.833]  And you're happy with that garden in the backyard.
[00:26:56.433 --> 00:26:59.154]  And beans cooking on the stove.
[00:27:03.097 --> 00:27:05.239]  With confident, strong people.
[00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:08.241]  When you look them in the eye, it's got the sparkle.
[00:27:09.782 --> 00:27:11.463]  See, I'm looking for the sparkle in my life.
[00:27:14.906 --> 00:27:17.188]  I remember, you can see it in photographs, you can see it everywhere.
[00:27:17.228 --> 00:27:18.589]  Everybody marvels about it when you think about it.
[00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:23.473]  Look at old photos, or think about when you were a kid, what your grandmother's eyes looked like.
[00:27:24.473 --> 00:27:25.334]  How they twinkled.
[00:27:27.195 --> 00:27:29.037]  You don't see a lot of the twinkle anymore, do you?
[00:27:30.134 --> 00:27:33.258]  I go to universities, I go to leftist areas, I see dead eyes.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.181]  Zombies.
[00:27:36.122 --> 00:27:42.951]  It's more than the drugs, it's more than the G5 and G2 and G3 and G4, it's more than that, it's more than the GMO.
[00:27:45.973 --> 00:27:48.054]  They are dead inside.
[00:27:48.114 --> 00:27:57.517]  They have given themselves over to evil, and they don't even know who they are, but they've all got that dead, satisfied smile on their face.
[00:27:57.937 --> 00:28:01.278]  In a false identity, they believe they've taken on, so they're good.
[00:28:01.418 --> 00:28:01.918]  They're cool.
[00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:07.020]  They're not running the show.
[00:28:09.821 --> 00:28:10.641]  They've been tricked.
[00:28:11.971 --> 00:28:18.555]  There's another energy there, suppressing the lightning rod to God that we are.
[00:28:21.857 --> 00:28:26.239]  And then you can see God blasting out of the soul through the electric eyes.
[00:28:26.259 --> 00:28:33.023]  Remember when I was a kid looking at my dad's eyes?
[00:28:34.324 --> 00:28:36.065]  And my dad could just smile and his eyes just go...
[00:28:40.791 --> 00:28:42.032]  And you don't see that anymore, do you?
[00:28:43.192 --> 00:28:44.093]  Twinkle in the eye.
[00:28:45.693 --> 00:28:47.574]  The twinkle in the eye is the sign of the soul.
[00:28:49.175 --> 00:28:50.796]  It's the light from within shining out.
[00:28:51.996 --> 00:28:57.539]  And you look into the eyes of AOC and Hillary, they're shark eyes.
[00:28:58.839 --> 00:29:00.800]  There's nothing there but death.
[00:29:05.971 --> 00:29:26.259]  If you're sick of mainstream news promoting fake hate crime stories and running with that, making that the big story, amplifying the hate crime that was totally fake, that they probably all knew was fake, but they wanted to go along with it because they hate America and they're racists, if you'd like to stick your finger in their eye, if you'd like to see people like Jesse Smollett shown up, go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:29:26.319 --> 00:29:27.359]  You know what?
[00:29:27.739 --> 00:29:28.880]  Let me just do this right now.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:29.600]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.081]  So these are the brand new protein bars at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:29:34.121 --> 00:29:35.122]  I got a box of them right here.
[00:29:35.142 --> 00:29:36.102]  You should buy a whole box.
[00:29:36.322 --> 00:29:37.443]  You should buy five boxes.
[00:29:37.803 --> 00:29:38.943]  40% off when you buy two or more.
[00:29:39.103 --> 00:29:41.204]  I'm just going to show you what you're dealing with with these protein bars.
[00:29:41.264 --> 00:29:46.106]  So first, you've got the outer layer, which is basically just a peanut butter outer layer.
[00:29:46.126 --> 00:29:47.286]  I mean, who doesn't like peanut butter?
[00:29:47.346 --> 00:29:47.967]  Very healthy.
[00:29:48.907 --> 00:29:49.887]  Good oils in there.
[00:29:50.107 --> 00:29:51.048]  The omega-3s.
[00:29:51.648 --> 00:29:52.768]  And it's got a great taste.
[00:29:53.329 --> 00:29:57.750]  So the peanut butter outer shell is what you see here originally.
[00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:58.871]  But then you bust it open.
[00:29:59.921 --> 00:30:03.785]  And inside, it looks like a double fudge brownie with peanuts in it.
[00:30:03.805 --> 00:30:05.967]  So I mean, honestly, it doesn't even taste like a protein bar.
[00:30:05.987 --> 00:30:07.468]  You wouldn't think you were eating a protein bar.
[00:30:07.488 --> 00:30:12.152]  You'd think you were eating some gourmet double fudge brownie chocolate bar combination.
[00:30:12.332 --> 00:30:13.253]  It really is that good.
[00:30:13.393 --> 00:30:16.476]  So it's the InfoWars Live Protein Bar at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:17.017 --> 00:30:19.079]  Alright, I busted open a protein bar.
[00:30:19.119 --> 00:30:21.501]  Now I'm just forcing myself to eat the whole thing here.
[00:30:21.521 --> 00:30:22.362]  I'm a little hungry.
[00:30:24.246 --> 00:30:24.886]  This is disgusting.
[00:30:24.906 --> 00:30:26.868]  You don't want to hear me eating this.
[00:30:27.788 --> 00:30:29.930]  I just shoved the whole protein bar in my mouth, folks.
[00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.591]  I could eat 10 more.
[00:30:31.811 --> 00:30:33.432]  I feel like I just had a chocolate sin.
[00:30:33.652 --> 00:30:36.514]  Man, you could, like, break that up and put it on ice cream.
[00:30:36.534 --> 00:30:37.695]  It's just the best brownie.
[00:30:37.735 --> 00:30:38.415]  The crew loves it.
[00:30:38.455 --> 00:30:40.517]  The crew is, like, purchasing this thing off the shelf.
[00:30:40.697 --> 00:30:42.878]  I've got boxes on the way to my house, as well.
[00:30:43.339 --> 00:30:45.300]  And I use all kinds of products from Infowarsstore.com.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:48.122]  I have two Alexa Pure Breeze air filters in my home.
[00:30:48.302 --> 00:30:50.864]  I've got the Alexa Pure water filter.
[00:30:50.964 --> 00:30:51.824]  These are products you need.
[00:30:51.864 --> 00:30:54.206]  I use the Infowars Life toothpaste, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[00:30:54.206 --> 00:30:56.267]  Fast-paced, it's all at InfoWarsStore.com, folks.
[00:30:56.287 --> 00:30:59.568]  If you're sick of the fake news lying about America, go to InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:31:59.859 --> 00:32:20.354]  You are the most degenerate, twisted, mentally ill people I've ever seen wanting to gang-rape this republic that has been the literal cornerstone, the absolute jewel and the crown of free Western Renaissance societies and the very best literature, music, technology, science, medicine, culture the world's ever seen!
[00:32:20.534 --> 00:32:23.436]  You Satanists want to sacrifice the West!
[00:32:23.897 --> 00:32:25.438]  You want to kill the beautiful
[00:32:25.618 --> 00:32:26.058]  You've got us!
[00:32:26.158 --> 00:32:28.040]  It is the West, you people are enemies!

[00:33:06.585 --> 00:33:09.208]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:23.092 --> 00:33:29.713]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:47.037 --> 00:33:50.458]  Well, in a whole bunch of European countries, and now
[00:33:51.693 --> 00:34:01.579]  in Austria has joined them saying that the refugee arrival centers are now departure centers and they're going to be kicked out.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.501]  What have I told you?
[00:34:39.048 --> 00:34:44.732]  Yeah, man, Cal's phone was busy, but then I texted him, he said, no, I'm sitting around here, so I'm just getting the guest on.
[00:34:49.776 --> 00:34:56.801]  Because he has his offices for a syndicated radio show and TV program right above where Smollett staged all this.
[00:34:58.502 --> 00:34:59.623]  Coming at you live.
[00:35:02.905 --> 00:35:03.906]  Klaus has got some good music.
[00:35:06.548 --> 00:35:06.768]  Live.
[00:35:07.408 --> 00:35:08.289]  Teleprompter free, baby.
[00:35:11.147 --> 00:35:12.889]  Okay, we're gonna go to Mancow as soon as we get him on.
[00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.152]  There's a bunch of other news, obviously I haven't gotten to yet.
[00:35:16.172 --> 00:35:18.654]  A bunch of incredible clips that we're going to play.
[00:35:19.995 --> 00:35:21.557]  But the first thing I need to do here...
[00:35:23.727 --> 00:35:26.170]  Is mid-air refueling.
[00:35:27.091 --> 00:35:28.393]  Mid-air refueling.
[00:35:28.794 --> 00:35:42.331]  This is a American populist, capitalist, pro-Christian, pro-Second Amendment, pro-human broadcast that is under globalist technocracy declared war.
[00:35:44.016 --> 00:35:57.665]  And we have had vicious victories because of you relaunching Americana and capitalism, not just here, but what I developed over 12 years ago, the plan, 1776 worldwide.
[00:35:58.966 --> 00:36:11.474]  And in documentaries that were seen hundreds of millions of times together, and on this broadcast, and in billions of views online, I challenged the government that if you're not criminals, like everybody says you are, then you should be able
[00:36:12.932 --> 00:36:18.056]  To stop globalism, because it's evil, it's unelected, it's tyrannical, it's fraudulent, it should be easy to beat it.
[00:36:18.517 --> 00:36:18.997]  And guess what?
[00:36:19.157 --> 00:36:20.458]  All over the world, it's being beaten everywhere.
[00:36:23.741 --> 00:36:28.945]  But ladies and gentlemen, it's going to take lots of money.
[00:36:29.285 --> 00:36:36.011]  BuzzFeed makes 300 plus million dollars a year, and has to be subsidized with over
[00:36:38.533 --> 00:36:39.774]  A hundred million dollars a year.
[00:36:40.594 --> 00:36:45.136]  And at our peak, we reached probably ten times what BuzzFeed did.
[00:36:45.376 --> 00:36:47.096]  Now we reach about twice what BuzzFeed did.
[00:36:49.357 --> 00:36:50.978]  Four hundred million plus dollars.
[00:36:52.058 --> 00:36:57.260]  It cost thirty million dollars a year to run in full force.
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.621]  It's just the bandwidth is in the millions and millions and millions.
[00:37:01.002 --> 00:37:06.384]  So that means I've got to sell a lot of product because we don't market up that much.
[00:37:08.677 --> 00:37:11.858]  So, I need everybody, and I'm thanking you, but it's the best toothpaste.
[00:37:11.918 --> 00:37:20.360]  It's fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, developed by my dad, a retired oral surgeon and dentist, made by one of the top companies in the nation.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.680]  It's concentrated.
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:23.480]  It doesn't have fillers.
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:31.522]  Just get your Super Blue toothpaste and immune gargle and mouthwash at InfoWareStore.com and fund the Pro Human Agenda.
[00:37:32.389 --> 00:37:33.170]  Get coffee.
[00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:35.432]  People get it and they go, my god, it's some of the best coffee I've ever had.
[00:37:35.753 --> 00:37:36.834]  And it's less than Whole Foods.
[00:37:37.014 --> 00:37:37.594]  Similar stuff.
[00:37:38.075 --> 00:37:42.559]  It's high mountain, wild picked, really good coffee.
[00:37:42.579 --> 00:37:43.440]  It's my favorite coffee.
[00:37:44.722 --> 00:37:49.326]  It was brought in by a fella in Texas and I used to drink it at HEB and I thought it was my favorite.
[00:37:50.147 --> 00:37:51.108]  And it's also strong.
[00:37:52.288 --> 00:38:03.736]  And I got a distributorship through them, but then Obama got in, and they didn't want to do business with me anymore, so I just went right to the actual farmers through another company in Colorado that brings it in.
[00:38:04.477 --> 00:38:05.457]  And it's even a little bit better.
[00:38:06.018 --> 00:38:14.484]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods nationwide now, started off in Texas, for on average about $8 more a pound than we sell it.
[00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:18.531]  98% satisfaction, 795 reviews on Power Reviews.
[00:38:18.551 --> 00:38:19.091]  4.9 stars.
[00:38:19.151 --> 00:38:19.492]  That's 4.8.
[00:38:19.572 --> 00:38:20.332]  I can't see.
[00:38:20.352 --> 00:38:21.133]  My eyes aren't as good anymore.
[00:38:29.881 --> 00:38:32.143]  So, just get the coffee with us.
[00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:33.364]  Sign up for AutoShip.
[00:38:33.384 --> 00:38:34.325]  An additional 10% off.
[00:38:34.525 --> 00:38:35.406]  And don't worry about it.
[00:38:35.847 --> 00:38:37.268]  Cancel any time for nothing.
[00:38:37.488 --> 00:38:38.529]  Cancel the AutoShip.
[00:38:38.569 --> 00:38:41.112]  But sign up every two weeks, every month, every two months, every three months.
[00:38:41.332 --> 00:38:42.052]  However you drink the coffee.
[00:38:42.533 --> 00:38:44.295]  I mean, I would just sign up for AutoShip every month.
[00:38:44.335 --> 00:38:45.235]  Get the toothpaste every month.
[00:38:45.256 --> 00:38:46.357]  Get the coffee every month.
[00:38:47.237 --> 00:38:48.438]  Get the fish oil you need.
[00:38:48.799 --> 00:38:49.319]  It's there.
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.460]  Infowarestore.com.
[00:38:52.688 --> 00:38:57.992]  We have the Strength and Recovery Combo Alpha Power that is incredible for stamina, libido, energy, and body.
[00:38:58.012 --> 00:39:01.295]  It's the strongest turmeric formula out there.
[00:39:01.455 --> 00:39:02.296]  95% curcuminoid.
[00:39:03.577 --> 00:39:04.938]  Average stuff sold at Whole Foods is 3-5%.
[00:39:05.118 --> 00:39:07.720]  I went out and said, I don't care.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.742]  They go, top brands put $2 a product in it.
[00:39:10.782 --> 00:39:12.504]  I go, I don't care.
[00:39:12.544 --> 00:39:13.344]  I want $10 a product in it.
[00:39:17.136 --> 00:39:22.280]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.281]  People buy supplements because they work.
[00:39:24.301 --> 00:39:26.002]  I mean, what do you think coffee is?
[00:39:26.022 --> 00:39:28.003]  They're trying to say that's a supplement now so they can ban it.
[00:39:28.284 --> 00:39:28.884]  It's plants.
[00:39:29.364 --> 00:39:30.205]  It's things in the earth.
[00:39:30.325 --> 00:39:30.825]  They work.
[00:39:32.566 --> 00:39:34.548]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:39:34.568 --> 00:39:34.968]  Just commit.
[00:39:38.018 --> 00:39:39.139]  Like a tithe to the truth.
[00:39:39.679 --> 00:39:42.281]  A tithe to stopping the Globalists and Soros and Hillary and the scumbags.
[00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:45.443]  And putting it in their eye, not bowing down to them.
[00:39:45.723 --> 00:39:49.345]  To just go, sign up for auto-ship and know you're funding this and you've got my commitment.
[00:39:49.546 --> 00:39:53.788]  I will fight till all the gas is out and all the blood's run out of my veins.
[00:39:54.969 --> 00:39:57.951]  I will stumble forward, biting the enemy as I go down.
[00:39:58.932 --> 00:40:00.873]  You have total commitment in me.
[00:40:01.333 --> 00:40:04.235]  Absolute, complete, total commitment.
[00:40:05.916 --> 00:40:06.737]  But I need that from you.
[00:40:09.073 --> 00:40:11.574]  It's unbelievable what we've already done together.
[00:40:11.594 --> 00:40:15.456]  All right, let's go to ManCow, mancowpodcast.com.
[00:40:16.177 --> 00:40:17.938]  ManCow took off a year.
[00:40:17.958 --> 00:40:21.119]  Of course, big syndicated TV radio host, Fox host, you name it.
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:22.940]  And he's a good friend of mine.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:23.901]  Got to know him over the years.
[00:40:23.941 --> 00:40:29.283]  And we have some of the same views, understandings about the real cosmology of the universe and the rabbit hole.
[00:40:29.523 --> 00:40:36.267]  And I'm going to air almost all of his first new podcast that's already rising up the charts on iTunes in the fourth hour today.
[00:40:36.607 --> 00:40:41.030]  Because he said it was powerful, his crew thought it was powerful, so we're going to air it here.
[00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:43.411]  But that's what we're getting into right now in this segment.
[00:40:43.431 --> 00:40:44.672]  The next, Mankow.
[00:40:45.773 --> 00:40:47.314]  You are an expert on Smollett.
[00:40:47.334 --> 00:40:53.498]  You've lived in Chicago most of your life, and now I got word that they're investigating people above him, putting him up to it.
[00:40:53.538 --> 00:40:54.599]  Now that's starting to come out in the news.
[00:40:55.079 --> 00:40:56.780]  Your offices are right above where this happened.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.360]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:40:58.521 --> 00:40:58.961]  Hey, man.
[00:40:59.542 --> 00:41:05.846]  Yeah, and listen, this podcast, not to sell it, I know you're going to play a chunk of it, but what I heard from everybody is, wow, this is
[00:41:06.991 --> 00:41:24.934]  Alex Jones that I've never heard and it's the Alex Jones that I know and look I hate the obviously when we're on the radio it's an amped up version of us you know I don't tell my kids double time and and you don't sell vitamins to your kids or whatever but but you know it's it is us but it's an amped up version but I think this is a
[00:41:26.191 --> 00:41:33.159]  I was good to show people the Alex that I know, which is a godly guy that's made some mistakes, but learns from his mistakes and moves on.
[00:41:33.179 --> 00:41:36.263]  And I also heard you talking about how you're going to fight to your last breath.
[00:41:36.743 --> 00:41:37.785]  And I believe that's true, man.
[00:41:37.825 --> 00:41:40.648]  You're a daring individual.
[00:41:41.354 --> 00:41:41.915]  You really are.
[00:41:42.535 --> 00:41:44.337]  History is going to write books about you.
[00:41:45.118 --> 00:41:54.508]  Okay, so where I broadcast in Chicago, if I look out my window, basically I look down upon where Jussie Smollett supposedly got attacked.
[00:41:54.548 --> 00:42:02.957]  The funny thing is that nobody's mentioned, and I was the first guy to question it, and of course the minute you do that, well, you know, there's so many protected
[00:42:03.709 --> 00:42:12.598]  By the way, I was on hold the day after it happened with you and heard you saying, this is a bunch of crap, I bet it's a fake hate crime.
[00:42:12.798 --> 00:42:17.163]  You ought to pull that audio and send it to me, because it is big that you question it the day after.
[00:42:18.325 --> 00:42:18.806]  Well, no, no.
[00:42:19.166 --> 00:42:24.932]  I mean, yeah, I was the first guy to say, I was the really first guy to say it because I was, I happened to be the first guy on the radio.
[00:42:24.972 --> 00:42:27.395]  I mean, I was the first guy to be able to say it live, live radio.
[00:42:27.415 --> 00:42:33.101]  I mean, that's one of the beauties of radio and doing it live, not prerecorded like a lot of these other guys.
[00:42:33.161 --> 00:42:38.006]  But, you know, one of the things that nobody's mentioned is, you know, we wanted this to be filmed.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:45.786]  And the moron did it in the one spot in Chicago where the cameras weren't working or were pointed the other way.
[00:42:45.846 --> 00:42:47.127]  I mean, that we don't realize.
[00:42:47.227 --> 00:42:48.668]  He wanted it to be filmed.
[00:42:49.209 --> 00:42:51.090]  Otherwise, he would have just said that it happened.
[00:42:51.631 --> 00:42:51.971]  Hold on.
[00:42:52.031 --> 00:42:52.391]  Stay there.
[00:42:52.451 --> 00:42:55.414]  The Inside Scoop on Smollett with Man Cow.
[00:42:55.454 --> 00:42:56.014]  Stay with us.
[00:42:56.515 --> 00:42:57.535]  Infowars.com.
[00:42:57.555 --> 00:42:58.837]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:42:58.857 --> 00:42:59.237]  Stay with us.
[00:43:04.722 --> 00:43:08.905]  This young fella put himself in front of me and wouldn't move.
[00:43:09.766 --> 00:43:15.230]  So they get to go free and go about their life and possibly attack someone else.
[00:43:15.951 --> 00:43:18.393]  And I'm here to left with the aftermath of this bull.
[00:43:19.378 --> 00:43:23.462]  Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter.
[00:43:24.123 --> 00:43:36.136]  I think that there's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right.
[00:43:36.696 --> 00:43:40.899]  This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an I Am Spartacus moment.
[00:43:40.919 --> 00:43:47.164]  You know, that whole, suddenly America's, like, the biggest oil producer and the biggest ga— That was me.
[00:43:47.564 --> 00:43:53.849]  His family was bitterly opposed to their relationship because she was part Native American.
[00:43:53.989 --> 00:43:59.974]  We landed in one of those corkscrew landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire.
[00:44:00.094 --> 00:44:03.416]  Why is—do we keep making the same mistake?
[00:44:03.656 --> 00:44:05.818]  Because we're desperate to get Trump out of office.
[00:44:06.078 --> 00:44:09.482]  But the return address said in big red, you know, like, CAPS.
[00:44:10.122 --> 00:44:10.523]  MAGA.
[00:44:11.304 --> 00:44:12.205]  Did I make that up too?
[00:44:13.466 --> 00:44:14.407]  Believe in something.
[00:44:15.228 --> 00:44:16.690]  Even if it never happened.
[00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:21.123]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[00:45:01.301 --> 00:45:01.641]  Today.
[00:45:02.955 --> 00:45:04.316]  Patriots are on the go.
[00:45:04.896 --> 00:45:09.078]  Hard-working Americans need high-quality energy when they're on the run.
[00:45:09.618 --> 00:45:19.923]  And ladies and gentlemen, we have spent years working with top developers to come out with the highest quality protein bar in vanilla coconut and chocolate peanut butter at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:45:20.063 --> 00:45:23.885]  This is a high-end bar sold for up to six, seven dollars at Whole Foods.
[00:45:24.145 --> 00:45:25.366]  Similar bars, it's high-end.
[00:45:25.966 --> 00:45:28.848]  Normally we sell it for three dollars a piece when you get it in the box.
[00:45:29.508 --> 00:45:32.951]  But with the discount we're running right now as an introductory offer, it's $2.40 a bar.
[00:45:33.251 --> 00:45:34.132]  No one can top that.
[00:45:34.493 --> 00:45:36.614]  And it funds liberty and the fight against the globalists.

[00:45:46.503 --> 00:45:47.644]  They're amazing.
[00:45:48.205 --> 00:45:51.908]  America is under globalist attack, but we've been having major victories.
[00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:55.572]  Their criminal EU is on the verge of literally collapsing.
[00:45:56.092 --> 00:46:00.395]  But the globalists are attempting to shut down independent media here in the United States.
[00:46:00.735 --> 00:46:04.217]  They're trying to shut down InfoWars as their number one enemy because we're so effective.
[00:46:04.618 --> 00:46:08.180]  And when you buy products at InfoWarsLife.com, you fund the whole operation.

[00:46:17.246 --> 00:46:22.509]  They're high-end bars that would be sold for six, seven bucks at Whole Foods for as low as $2.40 a piece at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:25.071 --> 00:46:32.120]  Take advantage of this, see how great they are, and help fund the InfoWars to take down the globalists all at the same time at InfoWarsLive.com.

[00:46:47.116 --> 00:46:47.857]  It's that simple.
[00:46:48.077 --> 00:46:51.600]  I'm very, very proud of the M4's Life protein bars that we've launched.
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:53.461]  Again, they are the highest quality.
[00:46:53.742 --> 00:46:54.662]  It's a total win-win.
[00:46:55.343 --> 00:47:01.668]  M4slife.com.
[00:47:06.492 --> 00:47:09.114]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:15.466 --> 00:47:26.054]  Eric Moeller, the man cow, has relaunched his syndicated program.
[00:47:44.059 --> 00:47:48.422]  Themancowpodcast.com is a separate thing he's doing, and you can find that.
[00:47:48.623 --> 00:47:50.004]  I was honored to be his first podcast.
[00:47:50.024 --> 00:47:53.546]  We're going to play most of it in the fourth hour, but you can go subscribe there.
[00:47:54.147 --> 00:47:58.951]  Going back to Mancow, I mean, this Smollett thing, I think, is a tipping point.
[00:47:59.511 --> 00:48:06.897]  The Covington kids was, Balazi, Ford, all this is hurting them, and they're only getting more nasty, more out of control, admitting their real ideology.
[00:48:06.917 --> 00:48:07.878]  We need to get rid of kids.
[00:48:08.238 --> 00:48:09.179]  There's too many people.
[00:48:09.219 --> 00:48:10.380]  You can't have hamburgers.
[00:48:11.901 --> 00:48:12.822]  The family's bad.
[00:48:13.642 --> 00:48:15.583]  All of this stuff is getting more and more insane.
[00:48:15.603 --> 00:48:17.144]  We're going to force inoculations on you.
[00:48:17.464 --> 00:48:18.485]  World government's good.
[00:48:18.705 --> 00:48:20.706]  We're not going to punish Catholic priests that rape kids.
[00:48:21.066 --> 00:48:22.327]  We're going to sexualize your kids.
[00:48:22.967 --> 00:48:26.009]  All of this stuff is out in the open now, and then Smollett gets caught.
[00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:27.550]  You're the expert.
[00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:28.571]  You're the Chicagoite.
[00:48:28.931 --> 00:48:30.192]  You were the first to report it.
[00:48:30.512 --> 00:48:33.113]  Tell us what you questioned, where you think this is going.
[00:48:34.754 --> 00:48:37.656]  Alex, you know, you talked about the Pope and the kids.
[00:48:37.716 --> 00:48:38.756]  I mean, it is satanic.
[00:48:38.796 --> 00:48:39.737]  I think people need to know that.
[00:48:39.817 --> 00:48:41.018]  It is a worldwide thing.
[00:48:41.478 --> 00:48:43.019]  You've really been the tip of the spear on this.
[00:48:44.006 --> 00:48:47.928]  And look, there's so much of what you just said, we could spend hours, you and I, talking about it.
[00:48:48.828 --> 00:48:52.009]  Look, I'm here in the city.
[00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:53.190]  I talked to all these people.
[00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:55.891]  I talked to the police chief, who's a very good guy.
[00:48:57.292 --> 00:48:58.592]  Everyone's saying the same thing.
[00:48:59.152 --> 00:49:02.834]  And that is, hey, you know, come on, let's love each other.
[00:49:03.454 --> 00:49:08.516]  But imagine if this was a Trump guy, a Trump supporter that had been attacked.
[00:49:09.357 --> 00:49:12.118]  And you know who this guy was committing a crime against?
[00:49:12.378 --> 00:49:12.558]  Me!
[00:49:13.442 --> 00:49:14.883]  I mean, he did it on the street where I walk.
[00:49:14.923 --> 00:49:16.243]  He did it on the street where I go.
[00:49:16.583 --> 00:49:17.624]  He did it where I work.
[00:49:17.984 --> 00:49:23.567]  He was basically... This guy's Twitter feed, if you haven't seen it, was filled with absolute hatred.
[00:49:23.587 --> 00:49:25.748]  Oh, he wanted a better job.
[00:49:25.848 --> 00:49:32.771]  I really hate that they kept saying that, or he wanted to get paid, or he wanted to extend his time on the Empire TV show, a set that I've been on numerous times.
[00:49:33.471 --> 00:49:34.391]  This was a hate crime.
[00:49:34.431 --> 00:49:36.072]  Staging a hate crime is a hate crime.
[00:49:36.092 --> 00:49:37.453]  First of all, I think we should just have crime.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:42.785]  I don't think your skin color or whatever, I don't think there should be special crime.
[00:49:43.065 --> 00:49:49.251]  But he was doing it to invoke racial conflict to be projected onto Trump supporters who frame us.
[00:49:50.356 --> 00:49:52.479]  Yeah, and, you know, I had Diamond and Silk on today.
[00:49:52.539 --> 00:49:54.060]  I mean, come on.
[00:49:54.101 --> 00:49:58.045]  This president, did you see all the pictures of Spike Lee hanging out with Trump?
[00:49:58.846 --> 00:50:00.268]  Russell Simmons is friendly with me.
[00:50:00.308 --> 00:50:01.289]  I love Russell Simmons.
[00:50:01.369 --> 00:50:02.951]  He's Donald Trump's best friend.
[00:50:03.632 --> 00:50:09.419]  Jesse Jackson, the Chicago guy, has been on our show many times and, you know, loves Donald Trump!
[00:50:09.939 --> 00:50:13.900]  And of course, but it doesn't play to their race-baiting fantasy.
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:17.101]  There's big money in black and white people hating each other.
[00:50:17.461 --> 00:50:19.462]  And Alex, it's what you and I talk about all the time.
[00:50:19.802 --> 00:50:21.442]  Man, you know, they're saying, yeah, let's love each other.
[00:50:21.542 --> 00:50:22.182]  Absolutely.
[00:50:22.843 --> 00:50:24.183]  And I see it here in Chicago.
[00:50:24.223 --> 00:50:25.643]  The African-Americans are moving out.
[00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:27.244]  The divide is on purpose.
[00:50:27.904 --> 00:50:29.644]  All of us, keep us stupid with our TV.
[00:50:29.684 --> 00:50:31.685]  Keep us stupid with our schools.
[00:50:32.225 --> 00:50:35.308]  Keep us stupid with our media and keep us fighting.
[00:50:35.709 --> 00:50:38.051]  And when we wake up and realize that we're all in this together.
[00:50:38.491 --> 00:50:41.654]  So this guy was an absolute racist, hated white people.
[00:50:42.115 --> 00:50:43.736]  His Twitter feed was filled with hatred.
[00:50:44.056 --> 00:50:45.498]  He faked this out of hatred.
[00:50:45.878 --> 00:50:49.341]  And you know, God forbid it wasn't some kind of race war that started in my city.
[00:50:51.343 --> 00:50:51.804]  You're right.
[00:50:52.024 --> 00:50:54.787]  I'm just listening to you because you're on fire.
[00:50:56.221 --> 00:51:09.601]  I was told by law enforcement last week that they're looking at people hired up in the cast, putting them up to it, and then sure enough, Fox News, Chicago Police say they have more evidence Jesse Smollett staged hate crime, and they're looking at other accomplices.
[00:51:10.697 --> 00:51:26.947]  Jesse Smollett may have gotten a hoax attack plot from Empire Creator's Instagram where he posted the very scenario months before and then other members of the show and the producers, the people in charge, have been caught staging events on themselves before.
[00:51:27.548 --> 00:51:29.449]  So this is a whole cottage industry there.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:34.443]  Look, Jussie was caught another time and gave a fake name.
[00:51:34.483 --> 00:51:35.785]  He's already lied, I believe.
[00:51:36.745 --> 00:51:39.047]  There was a Twitter feed where he may have taken this story.
[00:51:39.067 --> 00:51:42.751]  I don't think it was Empire-related, but maybe community-related.
[00:51:43.411 --> 00:51:45.873]  This is a show—look, this is big business to Chicago.
[00:51:45.893 --> 00:51:47.575]  You know, I want Empire to be here.
[00:51:47.975 --> 00:51:49.096]  It's not a show that I watch.
[00:51:49.136 --> 00:51:53.560]  But yeah, this thing was circling the drain, so they needed some attention.
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:52:05.448]  And you wouldn't dare cancel a show where there was, you know, this poor, this poor young actor, this poor, you know, African-American homosexual actor was beaten so viciously with guys wearing Trump hats.
[00:52:05.728 --> 00:52:10.151]  I mean, I think... The show already made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:52:10.231 --> 00:52:11.311]  It's had a long run.
[00:52:11.331 --> 00:52:12.832]  Fox bet everything on it.
[00:52:12.872 --> 00:52:14.133]  Now it's starting to lose ratings.
[00:52:14.534 --> 00:52:18.056]  This could have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars if it was pulled off right.
[00:52:19.281 --> 00:52:19.762]  That's right.
[00:52:20.383 --> 00:52:27.213]  And the head of the studio here at Cinespace, one of the head guys, told me, you know, Alex, you don't know the hell they went through because they thought it was anthrax.
[00:52:27.874 --> 00:52:33.924]  And, you know, any show on Chicago that you see, any show you see with the word Chicago, and these are big shows,
[00:52:34.691 --> 00:52:38.635]  Chicago Fire, Chicago PD, whatever those shows are, they're all shot in the same spot.
[00:52:38.755 --> 00:52:40.636]  Empire, but also a bunch of movies.
[00:52:41.037 --> 00:52:43.399]  I think Dark Mirror is shot here, some Netflix shows.
[00:52:43.979 --> 00:52:48.063]  So, you know, it's the second biggest studio on Earth, I believe, is now in Chicago.
[00:52:48.543 --> 00:52:55.049]  So Cinespace had to be shut down because this jackhole decided to crush up an aspirin and let people believe it was anthrax.
[00:52:55.709 --> 00:53:01.037]  So, I mean, there was, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars cost to the studios, the man hours.
[00:53:01.077 --> 00:53:03.680]  By the way, let me just give a little credit to the cops here.
[00:53:04.361 --> 00:53:05.423]  They're in one cop.
[00:53:06.164 --> 00:53:08.545]  There isn't one cop that thought that this was a real deal.
[00:53:08.965 --> 00:53:10.446]  But, you know, they did pursue it.
[00:53:10.486 --> 00:53:11.507]  They had to investigate it.
[00:53:11.967 --> 00:53:14.728]  But murders go unsolved here, and they're wasting all this time.
[00:53:14.748 --> 00:53:17.830]  Well, that's really the big crime, is they put 12 people on it.
[00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:20.231]  The media was demanding they find out who did it.
[00:53:20.251 --> 00:53:21.031]  And obviously, they get there.
[00:53:21.051 --> 00:53:22.852]  He's got fake scratches on his face.
[00:53:23.212 --> 00:53:25.313]  He's got the noose around his neck 40 minutes later.
[00:53:25.633 --> 00:53:26.634]  This is ridiculous!
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:28.761]  Listen, buddy.
[00:53:29.181 --> 00:53:30.002]  I know about you.
[00:53:30.462 --> 00:53:32.183]  You like to kick ass and take names.
[00:53:32.824 --> 00:53:33.244]  I'm a man.
[00:53:33.825 --> 00:53:35.586]  This has nothing to do with him being homosexual.
[00:53:35.606 --> 00:53:36.227]  I don't care, man.
[00:53:36.247 --> 00:53:37.468]  I'm a libertarian like you are.
[00:53:37.868 --> 00:53:38.609]  I'm a freedom guy.
[00:53:38.829 --> 00:53:39.710]  I don't care.
[00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:40.931]  I did a hundred shows.
[00:53:40.971 --> 00:53:41.812]  I was on Broadway.
[00:53:42.512 --> 00:53:43.593]  I don't care that he's gay.
[00:53:43.613 --> 00:53:44.654]  That's not the point I'm making.
[00:53:44.974 --> 00:53:50.379]  What I want to say is there isn't a man, straight or gay, that's been in a fight that said he was in a tussle.
[00:53:51.019 --> 00:53:55.983]  I'm telling you, if you're a lower whacking airborne bleaching your eyes and put a noose around your neck, you don't say it's a tussle.
[00:53:56.063 --> 00:54:00.387]  Look, even an average wimpy guy, you're trying to put a noose around their neck, they start kicking your ass.
[00:54:00.867 --> 00:54:02.048]  You start trying to kill people.
[00:54:02.288 --> 00:54:06.131]  I mean, you pull a noose out on me or anybody else, you're gonna get killed.
[00:54:07.032 --> 00:54:07.893]  He kept it on.
[00:54:08.373 --> 00:54:12.937]  They also found the magazines from these geniuses, the gang that couldn't shoot straight.
[00:54:13.437 --> 00:54:16.800]  They found the magazines, the cops are telling me, with the letters cut out.
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:18.341]  They found the bottle of bleach.
[00:54:19.002 --> 00:54:19.763]  They have video.
[00:54:19.843 --> 00:54:21.544]  I've seen the video from the Crafty Beaver store.
[00:54:21.565 --> 00:54:23.306]  This is where I go to get my building supplies.
[00:54:23.987 --> 00:54:25.488]  And, you know, it's right near me.
[00:54:25.768 --> 00:54:29.292]  Anyway, you see the two guys going in there to buy all the stuff.
[00:54:30.433 --> 00:54:32.094]  This thing is something else.
[00:54:32.335 --> 00:54:39.822]  Well, I mean, if you even look at the walk of the supposed guys on what did get caught on tape, it kind of looks like a kind of gangsterish swagger.
[00:54:40.762 --> 00:54:48.428]  But just imagine being in the middle of the freezing cold, middle of the night, and you're just hiding on an empty street for a guy to come out of Subway and scream, this is MAGA country.
[00:54:48.448 --> 00:54:50.489]  This is preposterous!
[00:54:50.929 --> 00:54:54.032]  And how many of the hundreds of hate crimes have turned out to be fake?
[00:54:54.192 --> 00:54:55.473]  Almost all of them are fake.
[00:54:56.934 --> 00:55:02.337]  Yeah, I mean, how many Islamic crimes, you know, crimes against Islam have been proven to be fake?
[00:55:03.278 --> 00:55:04.919]  You know, yeah.
[00:55:05.099 --> 00:55:08.862]  But, you know, look, these things do happen, and so now when it happens, we're going to
[00:55:09.597 --> 00:55:10.918]  You know, we're going to question it more.
[00:55:11.558 --> 00:55:13.659]  This is a bad thing that this guy did.
[00:55:13.679 --> 00:55:15.740]  What do you think, Alex?
[00:55:15.921 --> 00:55:17.902]  I mean, Don Lemon's saying we should forgive him.
[00:55:17.922 --> 00:55:20.103]  Of course, Don Lemon on CNN, the worst.
[00:55:21.184 --> 00:55:22.144]  What do you think is going to happen?
[00:55:22.204 --> 00:55:23.865]  Oh, Don Lemon, as you know, went further.
[00:55:23.885 --> 00:55:25.626]  I've already played the clip like five times, so I won't play it.
[00:55:25.646 --> 00:55:28.768]  He said, oh, Smollett just got bad advice.
[00:55:28.788 --> 00:55:29.628]  This was handled wrong.
[00:55:29.648 --> 00:55:32.590]  He's basically saying he just should have done a better job staging it.
[00:55:33.581 --> 00:55:34.761]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:34.841 --> 00:55:36.782]  So do you think Mullet will ever serve a mullet?
[00:55:38.782 --> 00:55:40.243]  Jesse Smollett from Full House.
[00:55:40.483 --> 00:55:40.843]  Sorry.
[00:55:41.363 --> 00:55:42.163]  Jesse Smollett.
[00:55:42.203 --> 00:55:44.764]  Do you ever think that he'll spend a day in jail?
[00:55:45.244 --> 00:55:54.946]  No, I think it's going to end up being just like Brian Williams, who I watched covering Jesse Smollett and still defending it when he's the guy that Clinton was shot down in a helicopter.
[00:55:54.966 --> 00:55:57.527]  I mean, these people just think we have no memory.
[00:55:58.752 --> 00:56:00.793]  Well, you know, yes, they're liars.
[00:56:01.033 --> 00:56:04.134]  So here you have it.
[00:56:04.154 --> 00:56:08.896]  Yeah, I think the guys, the two Nigerian brothers that helped, I think they're going to be fine.
[00:56:09.156 --> 00:56:10.376]  I think they'll go after Smollett.
[00:56:10.637 --> 00:56:14.618]  I wonder why they haven't gone after him for faking anthrax being said.
[00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:17.159]  That's using the mail system.
[00:56:17.179 --> 00:56:18.179]  That's a federal offense.
[00:56:18.459 --> 00:56:19.660]  He lied to the FBI.
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:21.221]  Why haven't charges been filed there?
[00:56:21.721 --> 00:56:24.822]  In the meantime, this is a bit of a local thing, but Kim Fox,
[00:56:25.362 --> 00:56:35.449]  You know, our head prosecutor here, when R. Kelly is using little girls' toilets, and while this is happening, Alex, can you guess where Kim Foxx was, our head attorney here?
[00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.410]  Where?
[00:56:37.471 --> 00:56:38.671]  Do you know where she was?
[00:56:38.992 --> 00:56:39.192]  No.
[00:56:40.112 --> 00:56:42.174]  She was at the Oscars, hanging out with Beyonce.
[00:56:42.594 --> 00:56:43.074]  Oh, that's right.
[00:56:43.114 --> 00:56:53.822]  I thought she might have been with the Black Congressional Caucus, $6,000 a night hotel rooms, $16,000-plus a piece flying down to South America for a Beyonce concert.
[00:56:54.737 --> 00:56:57.782]  Uh, well, you know, she is a talented, that Beyonce's talented.
[00:56:58.162 --> 00:57:03.169]  Uh, so yeah, so our, you know, our top prosecutor here is in Hollywood while all this is going down.
[00:57:03.189 --> 00:57:04.431]  We got a heck of a city here, man.
[00:57:04.792 --> 00:57:08.317]  The violence, the taxes, and we got a mayoral election.
[00:57:08.337 --> 00:57:10.500]  You know, I'm glad though that you brought up R. Kelly.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:13.662]  Do five more minutes, we'll have a two-minute break, come back, and then I've got my next guest.
[00:57:13.682 --> 00:57:18.545]  But me and Cal Muller's here, and we'll also briefly talk about why people are saying this podcast is so powerful.
[00:57:18.585 --> 00:57:23.348]  Because you never come on, or because I invited you on, and like want to say something's really powerful.
[00:57:23.368 --> 00:57:24.489]  So you're not hyping it.
[00:57:24.869 --> 00:57:30.392]  People really like this interview, and your staff told me that, and people say they were shaken by the end of it.
[00:57:30.973 --> 00:57:32.674]  So that's going to be coming up in the fourth hour.
[00:57:32.734 --> 00:57:33.634]  Thanks for letting me air that.
[00:57:33.654 --> 00:57:34.335]  But I want to ask you,
[00:57:35.365 --> 00:57:47.737]  How this guy, R. Kelly, was able to use young 13, 14-year-old girls as toilets, and how is a black guy pissing in the face of 13-year-old girls not a racial deal right there as well?
[00:57:47.777 --> 00:57:49.079]  But I guess they deserve it.
[00:57:49.119 --> 00:57:51.261]  They're 13, they're white, and that's what he likes to do.
[00:57:52.597 --> 00:57:57.559]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[00:57:57.779 --> 00:58:05.323]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[00:58:06.343 --> 00:58:08.924]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[00:58:09.325 --> 00:58:10.685]  How can I solve that problem?

[01:00:09.588 --> 01:00:11.169]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:11.489 --> 01:00:17.794]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:28.222 --> 01:00:38.470]  Only got five minutes left with Mankell and our next guest is going to be joining us.
[01:00:39.468 --> 01:00:41.891]  This is going to be, again, a very powerful broadcast the next three hours.
[01:00:41.911 --> 01:00:43.072]  We're now in hour two.
[01:00:43.492 --> 01:00:44.874]  Mancow, we're going to hit R. Kelly.
[01:00:44.894 --> 01:00:45.975]  We're going to hit the Oscars.
[01:00:46.615 --> 01:00:47.877]  You want to also get into...
[01:00:50.703 --> 01:00:52.684]  AOC and her thing about not having kids.
[01:00:52.744 --> 01:00:56.026]  So give us your view on... And you were correcting me off there.
[01:00:56.427 --> 01:00:58.668]  I read somewhere white girls, black girls, whatever.
[01:00:59.128 --> 01:01:01.410]  But yeah, he likes 13-year-old girls with braces.
[01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:03.131]  And he likes to urinate on them.
[01:01:03.371 --> 01:01:04.591]  Now Trump's been blamed with this.
[01:01:04.611 --> 01:01:05.632]  They admit that's fake now.
[01:01:05.672 --> 01:01:06.372]  That's not true.
[01:01:06.813 --> 01:01:08.714]  Trump's a germaphobe, by the way.
[01:01:08.734 --> 01:01:09.514]  He's the opposite of that.
[01:01:10.095 --> 01:01:11.876]  But how has this guy gotten away with this this long?
[01:01:13.195 --> 01:01:15.676]  Uh, because he's a star and he's part of the system.
[01:01:16.356 --> 01:01:18.617]  Look, I've seen him in church a couple of times where I go to church.
[01:01:18.697 --> 01:01:20.338]  I saw him with a guy, Steve Muncy's church.
[01:01:20.758 --> 01:01:21.899]  He's a talented guy.
[01:01:22.119 --> 01:01:24.160]  I know that's been lost, and I don't really care.
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:25.780]  Look, I believe in the death penalty.
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:26.881]  That's Mankow's law.
[01:01:27.321 --> 01:01:28.982]  I believe in the death penalty for pedophiles.
[01:01:29.362 --> 01:01:31.062]  I've got two 13-year-old daughters.
[01:01:31.823 --> 01:01:32.843]  But the guy's a celebrity.
[01:01:33.343 --> 01:01:36.465]  What he does is he, you know, they do the rope-a-dope.
[01:01:36.565 --> 01:01:38.626]  They keep everybody busy for five or six years.
[01:01:39.066 --> 01:01:42.027]  These girls look older in court, and then he moves on.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.103]  But he got away with it because he was, what, a Chicago insider?
[01:01:48.924 --> 01:01:50.265]  Well, and he had money, man.
[01:01:50.305 --> 01:01:50.966]  He had money.
[01:01:51.807 --> 01:01:54.069]  He picks up these poor girls that come from nothing.
[01:01:54.089 --> 01:01:54.890]  They don't have any money.
[01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:58.033]  And he's got a ton of cash to throw around, or at least he did.
[01:01:58.714 --> 01:01:59.995]  And he walks free.
[01:02:00.115 --> 01:02:02.057]  And he's using these kids' toilets.
[01:02:02.077 --> 01:02:03.239]  He's a real vile human being.
[01:02:03.359 --> 01:02:08.104]  Oh, by the way, you should get his manager on, who I had on, who said he's demonically possessed.
[01:02:08.824 --> 01:02:09.925]  Uh, and the guy's real serious.
[01:02:09.945 --> 01:02:13.966]  Look, as you've said before, this pedophilia, this is not a sexual thing.
[01:02:14.287 --> 01:02:16.788]  If a priest could have sex, he would have sex with women.
[01:02:17.048 --> 01:02:21.590]  They always say, oh, if priests could have sex, they wouldn't... It's about defiling children and sucking their energy.
[01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:26.132]  So these girls think it's great, all of a sudden they're there, he's drugging them, he's pissing on them.
[01:02:27.132 --> 01:02:30.674]  No, no, look, he's degrading women and crushing their soul, these little girls.
[01:02:31.094 --> 01:02:32.114]  Nobody's talking about it.
[01:02:32.154 --> 01:02:33.135]  The manager said it.
[01:02:33.535 --> 01:02:35.256]  He is demonically possessed.
[01:02:35.316 --> 01:02:38.037]  He heard, he heard R. Kelly speak in a demon's voice.
[01:02:38.889 --> 01:02:48.575]  And this is not a sexual thing, this is a satanic thing, and yeah, brother, you really, people need to understand, even the Pope, I mean, the Pope agrees with you, Alex.
[01:02:49.956 --> 01:02:59.302]  That's right, the Pope has now said that the rape of children is, like human sacrifice, is demonic, but then he separately lets the archdiocese cover up the rapes.
[01:03:00.632 --> 01:03:03.094]  I mean, you know, the fact that this is still being debated!
[01:03:03.114 --> 01:03:04.816]  I mean, we've heard this our whole life!
[01:03:04.836 --> 01:03:05.817]  What are they waiting for?
[01:03:06.137 --> 01:03:07.218]  It's 2019!
[01:03:07.599 --> 01:03:09.040]  I don't care if you're a priest or not!
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:11.362]  We need to start executing pedophiles!
[01:03:11.803 --> 01:03:12.723]  That's... Come on!
[01:03:12.743 --> 01:03:15.266]  These guys... Or at least castrate them!
[01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:20.222]  And that's the religion of Hollywood and all of this.
[01:03:20.302 --> 01:03:21.562]  I've talked to high-level folks in Hollywood.
[01:03:21.582 --> 01:03:23.562]  They said, listen, pedophilia is rampant.
[01:03:24.142 --> 01:03:25.683]  And it's all about screwing kids up.
[01:03:25.723 --> 01:03:26.683]  It's all about hurting them.
[01:03:26.703 --> 01:03:29.124]  I mean, you think peeing on them.
[01:03:29.144 --> 01:03:31.004]  That's something I guess he was taught by some other devil worshiper.
[01:03:31.384 --> 01:03:33.224]  They like to make little kids eat feces.
[01:03:33.805 --> 01:03:36.245]  They like to put them in cages till they're begging for money.
[01:03:36.665 --> 01:03:39.626]  And in three or four days, they crap and make them eat feces.
[01:03:43.281 --> 01:03:47.303]  You know, have you followed this Bohemian Rhapsody director?
[01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:48.123]  They're running from him.
[01:03:48.163 --> 01:03:49.264]  They don't want his name out there.
[01:03:49.664 --> 01:03:55.646]  But the guy that directed Bohemian Rhapsody, this Brian Singer, this is going back to the movie, what was it, Powder.
[01:03:56.326 --> 01:03:58.187]  This guy's had a long history of being a creep.
[01:03:58.567 --> 01:04:00.968]  But he makes money, so they keep paying him.
[01:04:01.408 --> 01:04:05.109]  It's really something, and it's no wonder people are not supporting Hollywood like they used to.
[01:04:05.129 --> 01:04:06.890]  These demons wanted to base children.
[01:04:07.941 --> 01:04:10.722]  With their purity and their potential for the whole universe.
[01:04:11.002 --> 01:04:12.482]  They want to ruin their lives.
[01:04:12.803 --> 01:04:13.903]  They want to screw them up.
[01:04:15.103 --> 01:04:17.644]  That's their most cherished thing.
[01:04:17.664 --> 01:04:18.764]  And I'm sorry to talk like this.
[01:04:19.585 --> 01:04:24.906]  I found a video, in fact, I think it was producers, of me 10 years ago saying devil worshippers drink children's blood.
[01:04:24.946 --> 01:04:26.007]  They call it ambrosia.
[01:04:26.467 --> 01:04:27.507]  Now that's in the text.
[01:04:28.147 --> 01:04:32.409]  Now the company that gets children's blood for rich people is called Ambrosia, man cow.
[01:04:32.769 --> 01:04:33.329]  I'm right again.
[01:04:34.099 --> 01:04:34.299]  Wow.
[01:04:34.719 --> 01:04:34.939]  Wow.
[01:04:35.259 --> 01:04:39.580]  Uh, you know, the whole spirit cooking thing, it's all, it's all, look, it's all very creepy.
[01:04:40.061 --> 01:04:44.762]  And as you know, they have, they prefer male children before the age of 13.
[01:04:45.062 --> 01:04:49.803]  That's why the, the age 13 little men has, has been, um, significant forever.
[01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:53.924]  And that's why this whole Jeffrey Epstein coverup is so vile.
[01:04:53.964 --> 01:04:55.165]  And that's right.
[01:04:55.205 --> 01:04:55.805]  God bless you.
[01:04:55.845 --> 01:04:57.785]  We'll air your podcast.
[01:04:57.845 --> 01:04:58.266]  Thank you, sir.
[01:04:58.286 --> 01:04:59.466]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:59.486 --> 01:04:59.846]  Stay with us.
[01:05:04.252 --> 01:05:05.874]  I cannot believe we even produced this.
[01:05:05.994 --> 01:05:08.976]  I mean, this, this, this is insane.
[01:05:09.277 --> 01:05:11.359]  I said, I'm a game changer.
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:13.240]  I'm a guru.
[01:05:14.461 --> 01:05:15.342]  I'm a scientist.
[01:05:16.463 --> 01:05:17.284]  I'm an activist.
[01:05:17.765 --> 01:05:19.927]  And, and, and, and other people aren't willing to do it.
[01:05:20.027 --> 01:05:23.730]  And, and, and I'll tell you right now, I'm here to ram heads with you.
[01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:27.994]  Energy drinks are bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[01:05:28.074 --> 01:05:29.415]  Well, it's not me, it's you.
[01:05:36.591 --> 01:05:37.492]  Did you hear what I just said?
[01:05:37.512 --> 01:05:57.690]  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[01:06:13.965 --> 01:06:19.108]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:06:19.608 --> 01:06:21.989]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:33.636]  Caitlin Bennett is going to be joining us here in a few minutes.
[01:06:34.276 --> 01:06:35.557]  She's her own reporter.
[01:06:35.577 --> 01:06:36.838]  She's the Penn State gun girl.
[01:06:38.286 --> 01:06:41.367]  And, but she also does a lot of reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:06:41.387 --> 01:06:44.248]  We're very, very honored to have her on air with us.
[01:06:44.328 --> 01:06:49.710]  In fact, I told her, I said, listen, we want to pay you to do your reports and finance you and support you and help you.
[01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:53.871]  But, you know, I don't want you to get banned or blackballed for being associated with InfoWars.
[01:06:53.891 --> 01:06:58.473]  She said, well, the only way I'll work with InfoWars is if I can say I'm with InfoWars.
[01:06:59.153 --> 01:07:04.418]  So she can go out there and face the libtards, face their fascism, face their threats, and face the censorship.
[01:07:05.139 --> 01:07:06.400]  And so she's bold.
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.622]  And I understand her thought process.
[01:07:09.062 --> 01:07:09.803]  So we appreciate her.
[01:07:09.823 --> 01:07:11.385]  It's the same way with Millie Weaver.
[01:07:11.405 --> 01:07:14.347]  Because I don't really tell reporters what to do around here.
[01:07:14.427 --> 01:07:19.973]  I just try to let them go because I know they're good people and just turn them loose.
[01:07:22.853 --> 01:07:23.433]  She's really right.
[01:07:23.473 --> 01:07:25.695]  If we don't all stand up for each other, we're all going to lose our free speech.
[01:07:25.715 --> 01:07:33.239]  And that's why, coming up in the next hour, this Tommy Robinson interview, ladies and gentlemen, is as big as it gets.
[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:39.623]  And that's why within a few hours of it getting a million and a half views on Instagram and on Facebook, his accounts were deleted.
[01:07:40.664 --> 01:07:44.346]  The British folk hero that exposed the giant Islamic child kidnapping rings.
[01:07:44.626 --> 01:07:46.067]  It's all been confirmed, thousands of convictions.
[01:07:46.787 --> 01:07:49.769]  Instead of getting national awards, he's been thrown in prison twice.
[01:07:51.738 --> 01:07:55.863]  And physically attacked all over the street by professors dressed up as Antifa.
[01:07:57.004 --> 01:07:59.727]  But this new video is posted on Infowars.com.
[01:07:59.747 --> 01:08:00.828]  We'll put that back on screen, thank you.
[01:08:01.609 --> 01:08:08.036]  Tommy Robinson documentary, hashtag panodrama, being blocked everywhere.
[01:08:08.922 --> 01:08:13.586]  Free speech and crosshairs as globalist corporations move to silence independent voices.
[01:08:13.626 --> 01:08:15.887]  Now, that's one of the earlier posts from today.
[01:08:16.208 --> 01:08:17.268]  I went in and wrote one earlier.
[01:08:17.288 --> 01:08:19.310]  I would imagine it's on Infowars.com.
[01:08:19.690 --> 01:08:20.111]  Let's see.
[01:08:20.851 --> 01:08:23.073]  Maybe just put the first page of Infowars.com.
[01:08:23.473 --> 01:08:27.396]  And Newswars.com is one you want to send out because it's not as censored or blocked as much.
[01:08:28.057 --> 01:08:29.538]  And scroll down there for me, thank you.
[01:08:30.258 --> 01:08:32.740]  And go through the little blocks there because I'm going to plug it down.
[01:08:33.001 --> 01:08:38.325]  And so it's posted in full from the YouTube version
[01:08:39.586 --> 01:08:46.611]  They're on the site and we need people to go get it and get it out to everybody they know.
[01:08:46.652 --> 01:08:47.993]  There it is right at the top exactly.
[01:08:49.634 --> 01:08:50.515]  Right there in the center column.
[01:08:50.535 --> 01:08:54.658]  Let's go back to newswars.com.
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:00.043]  Tommy Robinson documentary hashtag panadrama.
[01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:01.364]  Name blocked everywhere.
[01:09:01.384 --> 01:09:02.705]  Well that's not what I wrote but
[01:09:04.157 --> 01:09:05.358]  I'm not mad.
[01:09:05.478 --> 01:09:06.699]  I'm just doing too much here.
[01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:07.820]  I'm going to recap.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.262]  Probably going to rebroadcast for a while and then come back.
[01:09:09.422 --> 01:09:10.883]  That's what I'm going to do.
[01:09:11.163 --> 01:09:12.204]  Because I've got to go deal with this.
[01:09:12.224 --> 01:09:13.605]  This is really critical.
[01:09:13.665 --> 01:09:15.146]  This is critical.
[01:09:15.687 --> 01:09:20.431]  Critical that we say we have the banned video so people get it.
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:22.400]  That's what the victory is.
[01:09:22.881 --> 01:09:25.402]  We have to say, here it is, get it while you can.
[01:09:25.882 --> 01:09:30.423]  Because this is a major intelligence operation to shut down the independent media in this country.
[01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:31.764]  And in the UK.
[01:09:31.984 --> 01:09:35.925]  And we have them caught trying to set him up for sexual assault and crimes.
[01:09:36.206 --> 01:09:39.327]  We have them, it's funded by Soros, this will bring them down.
[01:09:39.607 --> 01:09:45.169]  This torpedo, if loaded in a tube of a submarine, and fired at the enemy,
[01:09:46.274 --> 01:09:51.279]  Dead Broadside will blow them to hell politically and shank them!
[01:09:51.299 --> 01:10:00.709]  Let's use a Hobbit analogy of the black arrow and smog.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.741]  But we have to tell people.
[01:10:04.462 --> 01:10:07.144]  We have to tell them that they are afraid of this film.
[01:10:07.184 --> 01:10:08.345]  They're trying to block it.
[01:10:08.605 --> 01:10:09.606]  They're trying to block it.
[01:10:09.646 --> 01:10:13.549]  This is the proof of what they're doing to us, what they're doing to Tommy, what they did to Kavanaugh.
[01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:14.650]  This is the proof.
[01:10:15.231 --> 01:10:18.874]  I'm going to go to rebroadcast until the next segment.
[01:10:18.894 --> 01:10:19.634]  Bring Caitlin back.
[01:10:19.674 --> 01:10:20.175]  She's awesome.
[01:10:20.735 --> 01:10:21.656]  Global Bombshell!
[01:10:21.696 --> 01:10:25.139]  BBC caught working with MI5 to frame and imprison journalists.
[01:10:25.179 --> 01:10:27.661]  Now that's the name of the live feed show.
[01:10:29.612 --> 01:10:32.974]  The YouTube is posted on both those pages.
[01:10:33.774 --> 01:10:45.380]  But there's another page that says, see the band Panadrama Film exposing the BBC and MI5 trying to imprison journalists.
[01:10:46.527 --> 01:10:47.107]  That's the headline.
[01:10:47.447 --> 01:10:48.428]  And I'm not mad at the crew.
[01:10:48.968 --> 01:10:52.930]  What happens is I get so much energy on the show, like kind of a race car engine, I over-rev.
[01:10:53.591 --> 01:10:56.912]  Because we're having victory after victory after victory.
[01:10:56.932 --> 01:11:01.335]  Behind the scenes, let me tell you, we're having huge victories come in, and it'll soon all be announced.
[01:11:01.875 --> 01:11:05.177]  Devastation of the globalists, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to you taking action.
[01:11:06.055 --> 01:11:09.017]  But, so she can comment on it when we come back, because you've got so many irons in the fire.
[01:11:09.337 --> 01:11:13.560]  Leftists saying that universities saying put Trump supporters in re-education camps.
[01:11:13.781 --> 01:11:15.222]  That video was on drugreport.com yesterday.
[01:11:15.422 --> 01:11:19.365]  She's gone on Logan's Big Giant podcast, reaching tens of millions a few days ago.
[01:11:19.625 --> 01:11:20.745]  That's gone viral.
[01:11:20.866 --> 01:11:26.810]  She went out and showed how out of 50-something people, two people knew who the president was, or that he was 45th president.
[01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:27.911]  All of that.
[01:11:28.511 --> 01:11:29.472]  So there's so much to cover.
[01:11:29.512 --> 01:11:43.741]  But the big one is the black Israelites, the same sect that was attacking the Covington kids, that the Native Americans said he was protecting the big black men, middle-aged black men and others, from the little kids.
[01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:46.402]  So I thought we'd play you a few minutes of this.
[01:11:46.462 --> 01:11:51.025]  It goes on and on and on, saying that she's white, so she needs to be killed.
[01:11:51.846 --> 01:11:53.427]  And this is who the mainstream media defends.
[01:11:53.447 --> 01:11:55.128]  They know full well who the black Israelites are.
[01:11:55.308 --> 01:11:56.309]  They've been around for decades.
[01:11:57.216 --> 01:12:00.037]  You know, I walked out of a mall in Houston, they're like, it's Alex Jones!
[01:12:00.637 --> 01:12:02.778]  The devil man who'll soon be killed!
[01:12:02.858 --> 01:12:04.018]  God will kill him!
[01:12:04.359 --> 01:12:05.479]  Soon he will be murdered!
[01:12:05.519 --> 01:12:06.379]  The time is coming!
[01:12:06.579 --> 01:12:09.140]  His intestines will be strewn across the planet!
[01:12:13.102 --> 01:12:15.543]  So let's, let's, let's go out to break with like four or five minutes of that.
[01:12:15.563 --> 01:12:16.483]  We'll come back with Caitlin Bennett.
[01:12:16.503 --> 01:12:16.863]  Here it is.
[01:12:17.743 --> 01:12:21.225]  God said to prepare your butts for slaughter today!
[01:12:21.405 --> 01:12:23.766]  Does he deserve to die?
[01:12:23.786 --> 01:12:24.526]  God said yes.
[01:12:30.925 --> 01:12:34.287]  Can you tell me, like, what this is?
[01:12:34.347 --> 01:12:39.090]  Yeah, can you just, like, explain, I guess, what you're doing or what your group represents?
[01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:52.857]  Okay, according to the Bible, black people, Hispanic people, Native American Indians, we are the 12 lost tribes of the nation of Israel, according to biblical history, world history, and archaeology, so on and so forth, man.
[01:12:53.357 --> 01:12:54.698]  So what does your group represent?
[01:12:54.738 --> 01:12:55.439]  What's your message?
[01:12:55.479 --> 01:12:57.760]  If you could give your message in one sentence, what would it be?
[01:12:58.422 --> 01:13:01.705]  The message you want to send is that we are the chosen people of God in Christ.
[01:13:02.085 --> 01:13:03.806]  Christ is a black man according to the Bible.
[01:13:04.227 --> 01:13:09.391]  Christ is very, very upset with America because of what America did to God's chosen people.
[01:13:10.012 --> 01:13:16.917]  And Christ is going to come back with the angels, what they call UFOs, really the beagles are the angels, what they call UFOs.
[01:13:17.298 --> 01:13:24.243]  Christ is going to come back in the chariots to deliver the 12 tribes of the nation of Israel from this current captivity that we're in.
[01:13:24.704 --> 01:13:25.985]  Okay, and what is your group called?
[01:13:26.684 --> 01:13:30.446]  We are the Hebrew Israelites, according to the Bible.
[01:13:30.526 --> 01:13:38.871]  Is this the group that was at the Covington Catholic controversy, telling people, telling the white kids there that their intestines should be strewn all over the ground?
[01:13:39.311 --> 01:13:40.192]  Is this the same group?
[01:13:41.092 --> 01:13:42.313]  We are not the same group.
[01:13:42.953 --> 01:13:46.116]  We all teach and use the Bible to back up what we're saying.
[01:13:46.396 --> 01:13:48.278]  So they use the Bible, we use the Bible.
[01:13:48.438 --> 01:13:49.559]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:13:49.579 --> 01:13:54.683]  So we're scattered to the four corners of the earth teaching the Word of God according to the Bible.
[01:13:54.723 --> 01:13:55.524]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:13:55.544 --> 01:13:56.384]  That's what we're teaching.
[01:13:56.725 --> 01:13:59.267]  So the truth is, uh, give me a scripture.
[01:13:59.287 --> 01:14:02.089]  Give me, uh, go back to Isaiah 8 and 12.
[01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:05.532]  So they were also black, Hebrew, Israelites.
[01:14:05.572 --> 01:14:07.073]  Were they not the same group?
[01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:11.612]  It's not black Hebrew Israelite, we are Hebrew Israelite.
[01:14:11.692 --> 01:14:16.214]  Okay, was that not the same group involved in that Covington case at the Washington D.C.
[01:14:16.254 --> 01:14:16.675]  Memorial?
[01:14:16.695 --> 01:14:17.735]  Was that not the same group?
[01:14:17.995 --> 01:14:19.796]  We're not the same group, but we know them.
[01:14:20.337 --> 01:14:23.558]  Will you disavow the things that they said to those white kids?
[01:14:23.578 --> 01:14:24.359]  What things are you talking about?
[01:14:24.379 --> 01:14:25.019]  Disavow what?
[01:14:25.219 --> 01:14:28.361]  They said that they were incest, they were cousin f***s, they're going to hell.
[01:14:28.401 --> 01:14:31.103]  They said that their intestines should be strewn across the floor.
[01:14:31.983 --> 01:14:34.385]  Can you disavow those statements?
[01:14:36.507 --> 01:14:37.569]  Will you just disavow?
[01:14:38.129 --> 01:14:43.054]  Will you disavow that they told those teenage kids that their intestines should be strewn across the floor?
[01:14:44.115 --> 01:14:46.517]  Will you disavow as someone that knows them?
[01:14:48.459 --> 01:14:52.140]  We know them, they represent God, so we're gonna read to you what God gotta say, okay?
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:55.341]  This is the book of Isaiah, chapter 14, verse 21.
[01:14:55.561 --> 01:14:56.001]  Uh-huh.
[01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:58.302]  Prepare slaughter for his children.
[01:14:58.322 --> 01:14:59.983]  God said prepare slaughter for his children.
[01:15:00.023 --> 01:15:03.164]  In the Caucasian race, prepare slaughter for their children.
[01:15:03.224 --> 01:15:03.504]  Go ahead.
[01:15:03.744 --> 01:15:05.925]  For the iniquity of their fathers.
[01:15:05.945 --> 01:15:08.045]  For what your forefathers did during the time of slavery.
[01:15:08.065 --> 01:15:09.346]  So you won't disavow it?
[01:15:10.026 --> 01:15:12.788]  You think it's okay to say that to teenagers?
[01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:19.473]  That they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.
[01:15:19.493 --> 01:15:20.834]  Now give me Luke.
[01:15:21.274 --> 01:15:22.415]  I'm going to take that as a yes.
[01:15:22.455 --> 01:15:24.116]  You guys think it's okay to say that?
[01:15:25.077 --> 01:15:26.358]  I just want a yes or a no.
[01:15:26.618 --> 01:15:27.239]  Yes or no.
[01:15:27.419 --> 01:15:28.019]  Yes or no.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:30.621]  Do you think it's okay to treat them like that?
[01:15:30.701 --> 01:15:31.221]  Yes or no.
[01:15:32.819 --> 01:15:33.759]  Look at that sign down there.
[01:15:34.099 --> 01:15:35.240]  I'm going to take that as a no.
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.560]  I'm going to take that as a no.
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:37.700]  I'm going to take that as a no.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:38.660]  That's gross.
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.201]  You won't disavow the people.
[01:15:40.241 --> 01:15:41.001]  Can you disavow it?
[01:15:41.021 --> 01:15:41.781]  Listen, listen.
[01:15:42.101 --> 01:15:44.382]  Was not the black people during the time of slavery, was it?
[01:15:44.462 --> 01:15:47.662]  Was not their children used for alligator bait?
[01:15:47.983 --> 01:15:49.743]  Was not their children's fingers cut off?
[01:15:49.863 --> 01:15:58.585]  I am asking if it's okay that someone you know that's in your organization told these teenagers... I will answer your question.
[01:16:04.342 --> 01:16:06.361]  I don't believe the globalists are that smart.
[01:16:09.682 --> 01:16:21.111]  I don't believe you're that stupid that we have this information and that if they shut me down, it's shut down when these pieces of crap are executing this information in front of everybody.
[01:16:21.151 --> 01:16:26.675]  Do you know why there have been layoffs at more than 20 major leftist fake news publications?
[01:16:26.815 --> 01:16:29.136]  From BuzzFeed to Newsweek to Vice.
[01:16:29.337 --> 01:16:30.537]  Why did it all happen this week?
[01:16:30.617 --> 01:16:33.279]  Why didn't it happen a month ago or a month from now?
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:34.941]  Why wasn't it doled out?
[01:16:35.101 --> 01:16:37.883]  Because it's uncertain.
[01:16:38.543 --> 01:16:43.626]  It's like a bombing run with a group of bombers flying in and they've all got targets.
[01:16:44.126 --> 01:16:46.627]  And they're all commanded by their HQ.
[01:16:46.887 --> 01:16:48.948]  And by the way, I don't just think that.
[01:16:49.128 --> 01:16:50.169]  I have their blueprint.
[01:16:50.369 --> 01:16:51.569]  I have their bombing run.
[01:16:51.629 --> 01:16:53.010]  I have their attack profile.
[01:16:53.290 --> 01:16:54.771]  I have their Achilles.
[01:16:55.511 --> 01:16:58.492]  And I'm here telling you their Achilles.
[01:16:59.093 --> 01:17:01.013]  I'm here telling you how to defeat them.
[01:17:01.354 --> 01:17:03.094]  Real intelligence is observation.
[01:17:04.215 --> 01:17:05.796]  Real intelligence is infiltration.
[01:17:06.798 --> 01:17:11.847]  Real intelligence is interfacing banging heads with your enemy.
[01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:17.778]  Because you begin to know your enemy better than the enemy
[01:17:19.352 --> 01:17:23.435]  All real warfare that's victorious is psychic.
[01:17:23.575 --> 01:17:29.719]  It can be physical, but that's only to draw out the essence of the enemy's goals and their fears.
[01:17:29.999 --> 01:17:35.502]  And then the commitment to meet your enemy with your goals and your love, love trumps all.
[01:17:35.582 --> 01:17:40.205]  But you have to realistically have the template of victory to be able to take it on.
[01:17:40.965 --> 01:17:53.513]  You can't counter a civilizational ending event, a planned viral demolition of humanity, a earth-ending termination of the birth of a new species, a new vision, a new world.
[01:17:53.753 --> 01:17:57.375]  You can't counter something like that with lack of vision.
[01:17:57.535 --> 01:17:59.216]  Simply countering their program.
[01:17:59.276 --> 01:18:06.561]  You must offer the world that you see and see if others believe in that world and see how they will then offer information
[01:18:06.781 --> 01:18:10.622]  You have to recruit in a war.
[01:18:10.822 --> 01:18:15.624]  And to do that, you need to look for people that aren't just trying to be in charge of something.
[01:18:15.664 --> 01:18:18.785]  You need to look for people that want to be involved in something.
[01:18:18.925 --> 01:18:20.625]  Involved in something bigger than them.
[01:18:20.945 --> 01:18:23.786]  Not because they want to rule people, but because they love people.
[01:18:23.806 --> 01:18:30.609]  Because they love their ancestors, and they love humanity, and they have a vision that they want to add to in the future.
[01:18:32.109 --> 01:18:35.110]  So that all the victories and the successes of our progeny
[01:18:36.135 --> 01:18:54.734]  When we're the ancestors, when we're long gone, we'll live on through those people in the future, and the incredible challenges they face, and the struggles, and the love, and the passion, and the will, as we become stronger, and stronger, and stronger, but then face greater and greater obstacles as the propulsion system of the future.
[01:18:55.255 --> 01:18:57.257]  And that's why these Satanists fear me so much.
[01:18:57.657 --> 01:19:02.961]  Because they've bet on this planet, and they've bet on their takeover, and they think they're victorious.
[01:19:03.001 --> 01:19:09.066]  And that's why I hate to plug products and the things we sell, but everything we sell is good.
[01:19:09.607 --> 01:19:11.948]  It's the best there is at the price it's at.
[01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:21.016]  And it funds what we're doing that's so fundamentally radical against the spirit of this world that it shakes the enemies of humanity to their very core.
[01:19:21.556 --> 01:19:23.737]  And that's why I know we're going to win in the end.
[01:19:23.837 --> 01:19:48.632]  But I want to ask you to commit, by word of mouth and by prayer, in the public realm and in personal soul, but also in the physical, the energy you expend every day in the system, to transfer part of that to us, to know that there is a full commitment to push our will against the enemy with everything we've got, and to lean in when their knives are stabbing into our guts, to lean into their hate, and just lean in and take it.
[01:19:49.392 --> 01:19:49.852]  I'm ready.
[01:19:49.872 --> 01:19:51.813]  And I'll lean in and I'll take it.
[01:19:52.093 --> 01:19:57.996]  But I need your backing so that when I swing my sword, it'll absolutely devastate the enemy.
[01:19:58.016 --> 01:20:01.218]  And when I raise my shield, it's your will that empowers it.
[01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:08.622]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:25.123 --> 01:20:33.149]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:33.389 --> 01:20:41.796]  Next hour, we're going to air the verboten first salvo in three Tommy Robinson documentaries that are coming out.
[01:20:42.636 --> 01:20:53.805]  Panodrama, a takeoff on the name of the BBC show Panorama, one of their top shows, caught trying to frame Tommy for sexual assault.
[01:20:56.724 --> 01:20:58.165]  It's unbelievable.
[01:20:58.205 --> 01:21:01.226]  And they've got two more salvos coming out, even worse.
[01:21:02.547 --> 01:21:03.427]  Now why is it important?
[01:21:04.188 --> 01:21:05.288]  It's the exact same model.
[01:21:05.308 --> 01:21:06.409]  We even have the secret documents.
[01:21:06.429 --> 01:21:07.869]  We're going to be covering it.
[01:21:10.071 --> 01:21:11.091]  It's all Soros funded.
[01:21:11.451 --> 01:21:13.692]  It's the same model used by Media Matters here.
[01:21:14.513 --> 01:21:17.894]  And it is beyond organized crime.
[01:21:17.994 --> 01:21:22.356]  It is intelligence agency tactics used to take down other countries.
[01:21:24.217 --> 01:21:24.958]  Totally illegal.
[01:21:25.896 --> 01:21:26.856]  Incredible scandal!
[01:21:32.519 --> 01:21:33.079]  That's coming up.
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:36.981]  Caitlin Bennett, again, is on fire with all the great work she's doing.
[01:21:37.882 --> 01:21:45.445]  She doesn't like to rattle off all of her achievements, but again, I'm not against Fox News, I'm not against Turning Point USA, but they all work the same.
[01:21:45.946 --> 01:21:54.930]  They get people in a stable, and they basically just control them, and they go out and do some good work, but then you control the whole movement, control the whole spectrum.
[01:21:56.045 --> 01:21:57.667]  And that's just how those groups work.
[01:21:57.687 --> 01:21:58.388]  They do good work.
[01:21:58.789 --> 01:22:00.471]  And they wanted to get her on board and all the rest of it.
[01:22:02.113 --> 01:22:03.074]  She approached him for it.
[01:22:04.035 --> 01:22:06.217]  She's been on guest on for her to work, but now...
[01:22:07.751 --> 01:22:24.223]  It seems like when they, then some of these groups will use surrogates to ridicule her and attack her and make fun of her, when people like the fact that, I wouldn't call it provincial, she's pretty sophisticated, but she has a provincial side, so do I, kind of a countryside, that they made a big joke out of it and tried to, like, make her go cry in the corner.
[01:22:24.263 --> 01:22:27.105]  Instead, you've gone from being really good to awesome.
[01:22:27.205 --> 01:22:32.669]  I mean, everybody's just sitting back with marvel at how just every day, two or three bombshells.
[01:22:33.770 --> 01:22:34.731]  What happened to you, girl?
[01:22:36.371 --> 01:22:37.051]  Well thank you!
[01:22:37.071 --> 01:22:47.894]  Well basically I like to take the energy that people, the negative energy that people throw at me like they try to lie about me or they try to make me feel bad because I don't do things the way that they want me to.
[01:22:47.954 --> 01:22:50.975]  I don't spread the message the way they want me to.
[01:22:51.095 --> 01:22:53.516]  So I take that negative energy and I just
[01:22:54.136 --> 01:23:05.282]  Focus it into how do I prove them wrong that I'm not doing good things and then I come out on top every single time and you know, it's working and I'm so proud.
[01:23:05.422 --> 01:23:07.784]  I'm proud of myself that I'm able to do it.
[01:23:07.804 --> 01:23:12.626]  Well, that's right and everything you do goes viral.
[01:23:13.867 --> 01:23:14.807]  Almost everything.
[01:23:15.288 --> 01:23:15.508]  Yeah.
[01:23:15.568 --> 01:23:17.929]  I mean, I don't know if it's because people hate me so much.
[01:23:17.989 --> 01:23:19.670]  They can't stop looking at my stuff.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:32.565]  Or if you know somewhere out there I am impacting the silent majority and they're sharing my things so you know somewhere along the lines it's happening and that's all that matters is that people are seeing me expose the left.
[01:23:34.686 --> 01:23:36.927]  Let's talk about the black Israelites because
[01:23:39.466 --> 01:23:47.413]  I've run into them for 20 years, and because I'm against black genocide of black people, they'll say, well, you've got some Native American, don't you?
[01:23:47.453 --> 01:23:48.834]  Well, we're not going to have to kill you.
[01:23:48.854 --> 01:23:51.256]  And I say, listen, you're no different than the Nazis.
[01:23:51.296 --> 01:23:52.217]  You just don't have a big army.
[01:23:52.737 --> 01:23:54.979]  And this is the same crap where every group always says this.
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:56.460]  And you're shameful.
[01:23:56.701 --> 01:23:57.821]  You're absolutely shameful.
[01:23:58.622 --> 01:24:00.283]  And I don't have time to play the whole 10-minute video.
[01:24:00.303 --> 01:24:01.823]  People can go watch it on Infowars.com.
[01:24:02.043 --> 01:24:02.743]  It's riveting stuff.
[01:24:02.763 --> 01:24:03.644]  I just don't want to hear it again.
[01:24:04.304 --> 01:24:06.304]  About a cave dweller?
[01:24:06.524 --> 01:24:07.825]  You're gonna be killed!
[01:24:07.925 --> 01:24:10.226]  And it's just like, it's so ridiculous.
[01:24:10.526 --> 01:24:15.987]  But because they're leftist and they're black, they think they can just say white people are inherently evil.
[01:24:16.327 --> 01:24:17.608]  And then he's like, oh, well you're white.
[01:24:17.768 --> 01:24:18.688]  All whites own slaves.
[01:24:18.708 --> 01:24:21.029]  2% of people here before 1867 had any slave
[01:24:25.922 --> 01:24:26.763]  Holdings, 2%.
[01:24:27.123 --> 01:24:28.183]  So 98% didn't.
[01:24:29.104 --> 01:24:32.746]  And then most of the population moved here after the Civil War.
[01:24:32.766 --> 01:24:35.548]  That's when we had the explosion, the quadrupling.
[01:24:36.289 --> 01:24:38.350]  And so people in Europe were serfs.
[01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:40.411]  They were slaves on the land or from Russia.
[01:24:40.972 --> 01:24:48.336]  And so the idea that white people all are guilty because some white people hundreds of years ago did something is crazy.
[01:24:48.636 --> 01:24:50.358]  But the left is adopting it where
[01:24:51.558 --> 01:24:53.740]  Again, if your neighbor does something wrong, well then you're in trouble.
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.101]  That's what the Soviet Union did.
[01:24:55.361 --> 01:24:56.302]  That's what Hitler did.
[01:24:56.862 --> 01:25:04.288]  If somebody shot an army officer in the German military in World War II in Poland or Russia, they'd kill the whole street, literally.
[01:25:04.728 --> 01:25:11.053]  And it's the same thing of authoritarians where they say, somebody did something a long time ago, so you're going to have to die.
[01:25:11.313 --> 01:25:12.254]  That's psychotic.
[01:25:13.544 --> 01:25:14.504]  Yeah, it's super crazy.
[01:25:14.544 --> 01:25:22.008]  So we dabbled a little bit of where we wanted to go to do street interviews, because we were just going to ask people about the 45th president and about toxic masculinity.
[01:25:22.448 --> 01:25:28.671]  And I hear in a loudspeaker this rhetoric about they're the chosen people of God.
[01:25:28.711 --> 01:25:35.714]  And I was like, this sounds like the same Israelite group that was at the Covington Catholic controversy in Washington, D.C.
[01:25:36.094 --> 01:25:40.236]  And I went up to them and I was like, this is a gold mine.
[01:25:40.296 --> 01:25:42.397]  Like, I was so happy that I ran into them.
[01:25:42.973 --> 01:25:44.872]  I started off really polite at first, you know.
[01:25:45.737 --> 01:25:46.337]  What's your group?
[01:25:46.377 --> 01:25:47.158]  What are you doing here?
[01:25:47.178 --> 01:25:54.042]  And then once I realized, yes, this was the same group and they admitted to it, I asked them to disavow those racist remarks.
[01:25:54.142 --> 01:25:57.324]  And they were worse than what they were.
[01:25:57.664 --> 01:26:04.689]  The group that was at the Covington Catholic in Washington, D.C., they were worse than what they were saying because they were pointing at me.
[01:26:04.749 --> 01:26:07.350]  They were pointing at my friends saying, you deserve to die.
[01:26:07.751 --> 01:26:09.192]  God said you deserve the sword.
[01:26:10.212 --> 01:26:12.834]  If the viewer should definitely go back and watch that whole video.
[01:26:13.612 --> 01:26:16.194]  Because they just keep saying more and more ridiculous things.
[01:26:16.655 --> 01:26:21.439]  I end up getting mad and I start addressing the crowd, calling them what they are.
[01:26:21.519 --> 01:26:25.443]  They're cowards and pansies, although I used a little different wording.
[01:26:25.503 --> 01:26:29.046]  I've never seen you use any French, but I guess this got you a little bit hot.
[01:26:30.228 --> 01:26:30.548]  It did.
[01:26:30.568 --> 01:26:32.650]  It made me extremely mad because
[01:26:33.371 --> 01:26:35.212]  White people are vilified in the media.
[01:26:35.252 --> 01:26:41.314]  The left tells us that we were slave owners and we need to pay reparations and we're bad people because we're white.
[01:26:41.814 --> 01:26:45.435]  And there is no such thing as racism against whites.
[01:26:45.495 --> 01:26:46.836]  We're fed that in college.
[01:26:46.856 --> 01:26:49.817]  I was fed that from my professors at my university.
[01:26:49.857 --> 01:26:51.017]  And a lot of New York Times articles.
[01:26:51.138 --> 01:26:53.158]  Can black people or Hispanics be racist?
[01:26:53.418 --> 01:26:54.199]  It's tribalism.
[01:26:54.239 --> 01:26:54.859]  Of course they can.
[01:26:56.128 --> 01:27:05.738]  It's, you know, this is a party of science and truth and knowledge, but they will completely change the definitions of words to fit their needs.
[01:27:05.818 --> 01:27:07.860]  They change the definition of racism.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:12.104]  Like a man with a large genitals is a woman.
[01:27:12.224 --> 01:27:12.885]  No, he's not.
[01:27:13.405 --> 01:27:15.007]  He's a man calling himself a woman.
[01:27:16.192 --> 01:27:16.673]  Exactly.
[01:27:16.713 --> 01:27:22.919]  They change the definitions to fit their needs and then they tell us we're the bad people when we try to stand up for the truth.
[01:27:23.399 --> 01:27:26.502]  And that's exactly what's going on with those Hebrew Israelites.
[01:27:26.582 --> 01:27:28.404]  Why isn't Fox News picking this up?
[01:27:28.484 --> 01:27:31.006]  Why isn't CNN picking this up?
[01:27:31.107 --> 01:27:33.469]  And MSNBC, why aren't they picking this up?
[01:27:33.849 --> 01:27:34.750]  This is dangerous.
[01:27:34.890 --> 01:27:35.311]  I don't see
[01:27:36.171 --> 01:27:50.404]  Uh, you know, if these were white people out there saying that blacks deserve to die and white people were the chosen people and we are the superior race, then, oh my gosh, it would be, we need every white person's head on a stake right now.
[01:27:50.804 --> 01:27:51.685]  But they get a pass.
[01:27:53.442 --> 01:27:55.283]  Well, take Sarah Zhang.
[01:27:55.683 --> 01:27:57.664]  She said whites need to be exterminated.
[01:27:57.764 --> 01:28:00.625]  They're cave-dwelling goblins that live in holes.
[01:28:01.005 --> 01:28:02.166]  She can't wait till we're all gone.
[01:28:02.186 --> 01:28:03.766]  She loves being mean to white people.
[01:28:04.266 --> 01:28:06.547]  And the New York Times defended that.
[01:28:06.607 --> 01:28:15.131]  So, this is the insane ethos where they have children's shows on YouTube where they teach Asian kids that whites are inherently evil.
[01:28:15.531 --> 01:28:17.472]  I mean, these people are whack jobs.
[01:28:18.112 --> 01:28:20.113]  But it's being encouraged by the political system.
[01:28:21.491 --> 01:28:21.971]  It is.
[01:28:22.331 --> 01:28:26.493]  It's really scary because it's more than just saying white people are evil.
[01:28:26.953 --> 01:28:35.936]  These guys are out there saying that we deserve to die and they're trying to trick people into thinking that's what the Bible says and that's what the Word of God is.
[01:28:36.437 --> 01:28:41.879]  And if you are a believer of God, I'm sure that you know that that is not what God says.
[01:28:41.939 --> 01:28:45.020]  Also, they're taking stuff out of context from the Old Testament.
[01:28:46.605 --> 01:28:51.028]  When the tribes were fighting groups that would also exterminate all of them.
[01:28:52.028 --> 01:28:54.950]  Or they would kill the men and take the women and children.
[01:28:55.290 --> 01:29:00.233]  And so those are genocidal wars in the Old Testament, specifically naming the wars.
[01:29:00.813 --> 01:29:01.714]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:09.141 --> 01:29:13.926]  I planned every segment today to wear a different t-shirt, and I just get too focused on the news and don't do it.
[01:29:14.727 --> 01:29:15.928]  But if you're a TV viewer, you can see it.
[01:29:15.948 --> 01:29:18.070]  It's Don't California, My USA.
[01:29:19.592 --> 01:29:21.293]  And it's got InfoWars.com on the right.
[01:29:22.455 --> 01:29:25.097]  And, uh, shoulder with the American flag.
[01:29:25.257 --> 01:29:27.759]  Don't California, my USA.
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:29.181]  Infowars.com.
[01:29:29.241 --> 01:29:31.342]  There's no reviews of this shirt because it just came in.
[01:29:31.382 --> 01:29:31.983]  It's brand new.
[01:29:32.223 --> 01:29:34.105]  And without you funding us, we will not be here.
[01:29:34.265 --> 01:29:37.287]  And again, even if you're not a big t-shirt person, we have some for women as well.
[01:29:37.407 --> 01:29:39.409]  Gold foil, Mullen Lobby shirts that women love.
[01:29:39.509 --> 01:29:40.790]  We have some more shirts for women, women of
[01:29:44.555 --> 01:29:45.615]  My wife likes to wear them around.
[01:29:45.815 --> 01:29:47.176]  And it's kind of choose your own adventure.
[01:29:47.196 --> 01:29:48.396]  And I've tried to explain this before.
[01:29:48.556 --> 01:29:51.657]  You wear a big, in-your-face, red InfoWars shirt.
[01:29:51.717 --> 01:29:53.637]  That's about as obnoxious as you're going to get.
[01:29:53.657 --> 01:29:55.778]  Then you're going to meet a lot of friends and a lot of cool people.
[01:29:55.798 --> 01:29:56.218]  Look at that.
[01:29:56.238 --> 01:29:58.739]  It's got a bunch of reviews, five stars, 100% review.
[01:29:58.899 --> 01:30:01.459]  American flag, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.com on the front.
[01:30:01.559 --> 01:30:02.720]  That shirt is the best seller.
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:06.221]  And that's for people that really want to, you know, go out and exercise the First Amendment.
[01:30:06.361 --> 01:30:11.342]  But if you wear just an IW hat, only patriots know what that is.
[01:30:12.362 --> 01:30:14.325]  And then you're just getting the love, not the hate.
[01:30:14.405 --> 01:30:18.631]  Or if you wear a Molon Labe, you don't think leftists can speak Latin or know that means come and take it.
[01:30:18.651 --> 01:30:18.811]  No.
[01:30:18.911 --> 01:30:22.236]  All they do is talk about how smart they are and listen to NPR and little snake voices all day.
[01:30:22.276 --> 01:30:23.698]  We've got over 100 t-shirts.
[01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:25.440]  Some are steadfast.
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:27.362]  One design I made 20 years ago.
[01:30:27.923 --> 01:30:28.464]  22 years ago now.
[01:30:28.604 --> 01:30:30.165]  Mass murderers of Greek uncontrolled works.
[01:30:30.345 --> 01:30:33.267]  I sat there on Photoshop and put Hitler, Stalin, and Mao by each other.
[01:30:33.327 --> 01:30:37.150]  On the back it says, politicians love disarmed peasants, which I got from a bumper sticker.
[01:30:37.170 --> 01:30:40.772]  Then we've got all these great designer shirts from George Washington and Abraham Lincoln on them.
[01:30:40.852 --> 01:30:42.493]  So we've got high-end shirts that are great.
[01:30:42.673 --> 01:30:43.854]  It'll be $50 at the mall.
[01:30:44.094 --> 01:30:44.634]  They're $25 here.
[01:30:44.654 --> 01:30:46.335]  We've got other shirts that are as low as $9.95.
[01:30:47.256 --> 01:30:48.057]  It's all there.
[01:30:48.217 --> 01:30:48.758]  Trump 2020.
[01:30:48.858 --> 01:30:50.219]  Won't tread on me.
[01:30:50.399 --> 01:30:51.480]  Re-elect 45.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:52.561]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[01:30:52.802 --> 01:30:53.883]  Hey, show them the George Washington.
[01:30:53.903 --> 01:30:55.945]  That's really good, soft, high-quality fabric.
[01:30:55.965 --> 01:30:58.467]  That's one of my favorite shirts I wear, is the George Washington.
[01:30:58.607 --> 01:31:05.494]  And it's him from his, before the French-Indian War, when he was a colonial scout, expanding the frontiers as a scientist.
[01:31:05.634 --> 01:31:07.016]  And as an engineer, he was out there.
[01:31:07.316 --> 01:31:08.277]  It's an adventure.
[01:31:08.377 --> 01:31:09.057]  Don't California, my USA.
[01:31:29.087 --> 01:31:30.388]  Who would want to wear a shirt like that?
[01:31:30.428 --> 01:31:33.171]  Or Alexandria Cortez as the dog?
[01:31:33.191 --> 01:31:39.176]  You know, she said, we'll have you subpoenaed or arrested, Donald Trump Jr., because you said, socialists eat their dogs, capitalists walk them.
[01:31:39.236 --> 01:31:41.098]  So I said, okay, well, we'll just put that shirt on.
[01:31:41.178 --> 01:31:42.879]  And I predict it to be a bestseller.
[01:31:42.959 --> 01:31:43.560]  It is.
[01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:44.420]  I've done two runs.
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:45.321]  This is the last run.
[01:31:45.341 --> 01:31:47.743]  We're coming up with a new variant of the Cortez shirt.
[01:31:47.843 --> 01:31:51.447]  But this limited edition is about to go the way of the Goonie Bird, which means extinct.
[01:31:51.647 --> 01:31:53.328]  So if you want it, InfoWareStore.com or 888-253-3139.

[01:33:06.970 --> 01:33:09.631]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:21.171]  Big Brother.
[01:33:22.551 --> 01:33:23.792]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:26.434]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:27.935 --> 01:33:28.875]  You want answers?
[01:33:29.856 --> 01:33:31.717]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:31.757 --> 01:33:38.041]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:41.023 --> 01:33:45.166]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, reporter Caitlin Bennett is with us.
[01:33:46.417 --> 01:33:53.594]  And like I said, she's been on fire, really triggering the left and so many others, you know, as a Penn State gun girl.
[01:33:56.061 --> 01:34:00.844]  I want to get into you going on Logan Paul, who does reach tens of millions of people.
[01:34:01.584 --> 01:34:03.725]  You keep saying he's the biggest podcast in the world.
[01:34:03.805 --> 01:34:07.027]  No, we were the biggest podcast in the world until they delisted us.
[01:34:07.107 --> 01:34:07.907]  Now it's Joe Rogan.
[01:34:08.708 --> 01:34:10.389]  So that's just not true.
[01:34:10.429 --> 01:34:12.310]  But you know, the guy's funny, whatever.
[01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:16.532]  It's kind of the college kids that the tweenies and 13 year olds, you know, look up to.
[01:34:17.072 --> 01:34:20.274]  My 14 year old daughter, you know, likes Logan Paul.
[01:34:22.121 --> 01:34:23.904]  Uh, because their whole school does.
[01:34:24.765 --> 01:34:27.789]  So it's important to reach out to these folks and I'm glad you went on there.
[01:34:28.230 --> 01:34:31.194]  I did not put you up to the TurboForce product placement.
[01:34:32.596 --> 01:34:34.338]  They got pretty mad about it and said you owe us $12,000.
[01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:38.572]  I guess that's how much a plug on their show is.
[01:34:39.172 --> 01:34:50.544]  I mean, I gotta say, it didn't really sell any turbo force because I don't think that tweenies, you know, tween, 10 year old girls, 12 year old girls, I don't think that they're out there buying turbo force.
[01:34:51.024 --> 01:34:53.207]  You know, our audience is the military and
[01:34:53.707 --> 01:34:55.368]  Intelligence agencies and foreign governments.
[01:34:55.408 --> 01:34:57.129]  And I'm not putting Logan Paul down.
[01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:58.029]  He has an important audience.
[01:34:58.330 --> 01:34:58.710]  Children.
[01:34:59.230 --> 01:35:00.351]  But I'm glad you went on the show.
[01:35:00.371 --> 01:35:01.311]  So I want to get into that.
[01:35:01.331 --> 01:35:03.252]  Then we'll get into the college students.
[01:35:03.292 --> 01:35:06.594]  The vast majority saying, put conservatives in re-education camps.
[01:35:06.614 --> 01:35:08.315]  Something Hillary's actually called for.
[01:35:08.355 --> 01:35:10.876]  We need fun camps for men to re-educate them.
[01:35:10.916 --> 01:35:11.837]  Just introducing the idea.
[01:35:11.857 --> 01:35:13.137]  But first, tell us about Logan Paul.
[01:35:13.157 --> 01:35:13.958]  We're going to play this clip.
[01:35:16.795 --> 01:35:22.897]  So, um, when I went on there, I was super nervous because I know that I wanted to bring the Turbo Force on there.
[01:35:23.658 --> 01:35:29.180]  One, completely as, like, just a joke, something fun to do, because Logan is crazy.
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:35.883]  His entire podcast, his friends are just absolutely crazy, and I thought they would, like, get a laugh out of it.
[01:35:36.303 --> 01:35:44.086]  And it kind of didn't go the way I figured, because then, in their eyes, it kind of looked like I was trying to plug something for free, and I was like,
[01:35:44.744 --> 01:35:45.845]  Well, I'm just trying to be funny.
[01:35:45.925 --> 01:35:46.885]  Like, I'm trying to be funny.
[01:35:47.506 --> 01:35:49.507]  Um, you know, everybody... You did great, though!
[01:35:49.567 --> 01:35:51.888]  I mean, you should have gone further and dared him to snort it.
[01:35:52.789 --> 01:35:53.149]  I did!
[01:35:53.469 --> 01:35:57.312]  I did dare him to snort it, and he's like, I'm not snorting anything on my own podcast!
[01:35:57.392 --> 01:35:59.573]  And I was like, how do I handle this?
[01:35:59.613 --> 01:36:01.214]  Like, how do I think quick on my toes?
[01:36:01.254 --> 01:36:06.337]  Because I felt really weird after that, because I was like, oh my god, he thinks I'm disrespectful.
[01:36:06.457 --> 01:36:08.779]  Isn't he the guy that, like, makes fun of dead bodies and stuff?
[01:36:09.764 --> 01:36:12.785]  Yeah, that's what he is most commonly known for.
[01:36:12.805 --> 01:36:17.107]  And then afterwards... I gotta say, he looks like Jimmy Savelle's son.
[01:36:19.148 --> 01:36:22.309]  Yeah, but I mean, like, afterwards, I think everything calmed down.
[01:36:22.349 --> 01:36:26.491]  And then after we were done with the podcast, they were like, I think we'll actually try this.
[01:36:26.551 --> 01:36:27.151]  And I'm like, what?
[01:36:27.191 --> 01:36:30.493]  Can you just say that on air instead of making me feel bad?
[01:36:32.036 --> 01:36:36.778]  And by the way, if he wants to go to a forest where the Japanese commit suicide, I think they have one of the highest rates in the world.
[01:36:36.838 --> 01:36:40.079]  That's his right to do it and make fun of the dead bodies.
[01:36:40.179 --> 01:36:42.020]  I'm not saying he should be taken off air.
[01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:44.541]  I can say that's very distasteful and I don't like it.
[01:36:44.681 --> 01:36:46.742]  Doesn't mean I want Logan Paul off the air.
[01:36:48.271 --> 01:37:15.366]  Absolutely, and I don't know if you've watched the whole podcast, but about, I would say an hour in, his co-host Mike ended up saying that you belong in a mental institution because of the things you said, and then they tried to bring up the fact that you've been banned off of Twitter, but they allow porn on Twitter, as that you're crazy, and I had to tell them that this is more about Twitter, that they're more scared of Alex Jones and his opinions than they are porn being on their website.
[01:37:15.646 --> 01:37:16.666]  So that's about an hour in.
[01:37:16.686 --> 01:37:17.627]  We'll try to find that.
[01:37:17.647 --> 01:37:26.089]  You know, what blows me away is that are they as stupid as they act or are they dumbing it down for young people?
[01:37:26.109 --> 01:37:29.190]  Because obviously they know that Galileo was censored.
[01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:32.351]  They obviously know that Anne Frank had to secretly write her diary.
[01:37:32.651 --> 01:37:35.272]  I mean, they know that usually people being censored are good guys, right?
[01:37:37.492 --> 01:37:43.478]  One of them, the Mike guy, was kind of on the defensive about Alex Jones is bad, he's being censored for a reason.
[01:37:43.838 --> 01:37:47.461]  But Spencer, the guy that I was sitting right next to, he agreed with me.
[01:37:47.501 --> 01:37:55.649]  He's like, you know, she has a point that Twitter is censoring Alex and a bunch of other people when they allow porn on their website.
[01:37:55.689 --> 01:37:56.970]  So I think that says more about Twitter.
[01:37:57.410 --> 01:37:58.271]  He agreed with me.
[01:37:58.951 --> 01:38:06.494]  That also, I think I touched a point with Mike as well, and I kind of opened their eyes to the censorship problem that Twitter is having.
[01:38:07.415 --> 01:38:09.856]  Well, I would love to invite Logan Paul on the show.
[01:38:09.876 --> 01:38:17.200]  I would also love to go on that broadcast because I'd like to be able to speak to my oldest daughter's
[01:38:18.838 --> 01:38:37.670]  audience and you know tell my daughter now be good and don't vape like the other girls and don't don't smoke cigarettes honey and you know you'll be good but it's it's just ridiculous to know that these guys aren't making a bigger issue out of censorship they know full well that we were banned off YouTube
[01:38:38.871 --> 01:38:42.176]  Yeah, and I think Logan understands that.
[01:38:42.236 --> 01:38:44.499]  Logan didn't talk a lot during the podcast.
[01:38:44.559 --> 01:38:46.122]  I think he was taking everything in.
[01:38:46.602 --> 01:38:52.892]  If you look and you watch his facial expressions as I'm talking to Mike and I'm talking to Spencer, Logan's just listening.
[01:38:53.132 --> 01:38:54.314]  He's kind of taking it in.
[01:38:54.774 --> 01:39:00.315]  Which I didn't mind at all because, you know, he's also taking it in, but his audience is taking it in as well.
[01:39:01.015 --> 01:39:06.156]  You know, his audience is getting perspective on gun rights and the Second Amendment that they probably didn't think they were ever going to watch.
[01:39:06.496 --> 01:39:09.457]  So that's out there now, and they're getting a perspective on censorship.
[01:39:09.837 --> 01:39:19.059]  And I think that Logan understands this because I'm honestly surprised that he even has a count-up because of the outrage over his Suicide Force video.
[01:39:19.079 --> 01:39:24.020]  So I think he understands very well that everybody could be censored at one point or the other.
[01:39:24.775 --> 01:39:26.996]  And by the way, I'm not being mean to Logan Paul.
[01:39:27.716 --> 01:39:30.797]  He literally, he has the same facial structure as Jimmy Chevelle.
[01:39:31.457 --> 01:39:33.758]  Jimmy Chevelle looked like a pedophile and was a pedophile.
[01:39:33.798 --> 01:39:35.019]  I'm not saying that Logan is that.
[01:39:35.039 --> 01:39:35.739]  I don't think he is.
[01:39:36.059 --> 01:39:41.841]  I'm just, it's shocking that, that is an extremely English, old English face.
[01:39:43.102 --> 01:39:44.842]  And so this is shocking.
[01:39:45.002 --> 01:39:46.043]  This is, I mean, I'm not kidding.
[01:39:46.523 --> 01:39:49.004]  If you're a TV viewer, does he not look like Jimmy Chevelle?
[01:39:50.498 --> 01:39:51.178]  I think he does.
[01:39:51.218 --> 01:39:55.621]  Yeah, now that you pull the picture up, the facial structure is the same.
[01:39:55.881 --> 01:39:56.481]  That's funny.
[01:39:56.501 --> 01:40:02.005]  Yeah, so Jimmy Savelle was obsessed with dead bodies.
[01:40:02.185 --> 01:40:04.986]  That is super ironic.
[01:40:05.486 --> 01:40:07.708]  I'm just saying, you know, just saying.
[01:40:09.749 --> 01:40:14.131]  How do we know that they didn't actually take his brain out and put it into a new clone body?
[01:40:15.612 --> 01:40:16.993]  Maybe it's a reincarnation.
[01:40:18.254 --> 01:40:18.554]  Yeah.
[01:40:19.870 --> 01:40:21.531]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:40:22.331 --> 01:40:24.532]  Logan Paul does not look like a child molester.
[01:40:24.992 --> 01:40:26.753]  Brian Stelter looks like one.
[01:40:28.593 --> 01:40:29.094]  There you go.
[01:40:29.114 --> 01:40:31.174]  Imagine that coming at your kids.
[01:40:31.334 --> 01:40:31.975]  Good God.
[01:40:33.075 --> 01:40:35.216]  That is the face, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:38.657]  Man, get him off the screen right now.
[01:40:38.717 --> 01:40:38.977]  Sorry.
[01:40:39.458 --> 01:40:41.358]  Hey, I don't mean to be mean like that, but I'm telling you.
[01:40:41.938 --> 01:40:43.019]  Brian Stelter is
[01:40:45.967 --> 01:40:46.487]  Pretty bad news.
[01:40:46.547 --> 01:40:47.568]  I'm just going to stop right there.
[01:40:48.208 --> 01:40:57.813]  Let's get more serious, though, and play a few clips of you introducing him to TurboForce, which is beyond an energy drink, beyond a pre-workout, long-burning, incredibly clean energy.
[01:40:57.853 --> 01:40:58.133]  Here it is.
[01:41:05.662 --> 01:41:06.663]  I took two shots last night.
[01:41:06.723 --> 01:41:07.503]  I think I'm hungover.
[01:41:07.663 --> 01:41:08.864]  Yeah, this is a first.
[01:41:08.944 --> 01:41:10.404]  So, he went out last night.
[01:41:10.444 --> 01:41:12.065]  He drank a little bit.
[01:41:12.165 --> 01:41:13.826]  I was asleep by 9.32 p.m.
[01:41:13.846 --> 01:41:15.066]  These are college guys.
[01:41:15.206 --> 01:41:15.626]  Wow.
[01:41:15.706 --> 01:41:17.747]  That learn how to act cool in front of little kids.
[01:41:17.767 --> 01:41:18.808]  I took two shots, bro.
[01:41:18.888 --> 01:41:19.808]  It's quite an angle.
[01:41:19.848 --> 01:41:21.209]  It was National Margarita Day.
[01:41:21.309 --> 01:41:22.149]  Ease up on me, guys.
[01:41:22.169 --> 01:41:23.490]  It was actually Jimmy Savelle's specialty.
[01:41:23.650 --> 01:41:24.530]  It's kids entertainment.
[01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:28.312]  So, you celebrated National Margarita Day by taking shots.
[01:41:29.039 --> 01:41:35.321]  If you're not subscribed, make sure to subscribe for every list of podcasts, iTunes, YouTube, Spotify.
[01:41:35.862 --> 01:41:37.502]  Today is going to get juicy.
[01:41:38.263 --> 01:41:41.124]  Today is going to get very, very juicy.
[01:41:41.324 --> 01:41:43.805]  As you can see, the guest is sitting to my right.
[01:41:43.845 --> 01:41:46.286]  She's already on the set, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:46.806 --> 01:41:47.647]  I want to introduce her.
[01:41:47.687 --> 01:41:50.010]  She's a very controversial guest.
[01:41:50.570 --> 01:41:52.513]  Arguably more than myself.
[01:41:53.053 --> 01:41:53.654]  Whoa.
[01:41:54.074 --> 01:41:55.316]  That's a bold statement.
[01:41:55.356 --> 01:41:58.199]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Portia on the main stage.
[01:41:58.219 --> 01:41:58.860]  The way he's introducing her.
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:01.182]  It's the Kent State gun girl, Caitlin Bennett.
[01:42:02.063 --> 01:42:02.924]  Yay!
[01:42:03.825 --> 01:42:04.605]  I don't get a clap.
[01:42:05.646 --> 01:42:06.787]  Jeb Bush, please clap.
[01:42:06.807 --> 01:42:10.450]  My daughter literally has a Supreme sticker on her laptop like this other guy.
[01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:12.311]  In a lot of ways.
[01:42:12.331 --> 01:42:13.132]  How are you, Caitlyn?
[01:42:13.412 --> 01:42:14.012]  I am good.
[01:42:14.033 --> 01:42:15.093]  I am great.
[01:42:15.374 --> 01:42:15.614]  Are you?
[01:42:15.634 --> 01:42:16.534]  Because you seem tense.
[01:42:17.015 --> 01:42:17.855]  I am nervous.
[01:42:17.956 --> 01:42:18.576]  I am nervous.
[01:42:18.596 --> 01:42:18.956]  Wait a minute.
[01:42:18.976 --> 01:42:20.217]  She's got one of those stickers, too.
[01:42:21.584 --> 01:42:23.405]  Millions of people will probably see this.
[01:42:23.485 --> 01:42:24.586]  Millions of people already see you.
[01:42:24.646 --> 01:42:26.166]  Wait, before... That's true.
[01:42:26.567 --> 01:42:28.528]  Before we get started, you said you were tired.
[01:42:28.788 --> 01:42:29.548]  Yeah, I'm exhausted.
[01:42:29.668 --> 01:42:30.949]  Okay, is anybody else tired?
[01:42:30.969 --> 01:42:32.390]  I feel pretty good.
[01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:32.750]  I'm up.
[01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:33.951]  I don't like where this is going.
[01:42:34.901 --> 01:42:36.042]  Something for all of you.
[01:42:36.062 --> 01:42:37.783]  Can you be careful when you reach in your pockets like that?
[01:42:38.364 --> 01:42:38.584]  No.
[01:42:39.104 --> 01:42:39.704]  That would be great.
[01:42:39.725 --> 01:42:40.025]  Thanks.
[01:42:40.245 --> 01:42:41.306]  This is Turbo Force.
[01:42:41.526 --> 01:42:42.046]  Oh my god.
[01:42:42.086 --> 01:42:43.948]  Are you vlogging our whole fucking show?
[01:42:43.988 --> 01:42:44.428]  No!
[01:42:44.508 --> 01:42:44.908]  Watch.
[01:42:45.529 --> 01:42:47.650]  I'm gonna need you to write a check right now.
[01:42:48.111 --> 01:42:49.612]  Energy drink you will ever get.
[01:42:49.652 --> 01:42:51.133]  It's the essence of Alex Jones.
[01:42:51.153 --> 01:42:51.333]  No, no.
[01:42:51.353 --> 01:42:52.734]  She's your guest, buddy.
[01:42:52.754 --> 01:42:53.634]  We're gonna come back with this.
[01:42:54.115 --> 01:42:54.735]  They freak you out.
[01:42:55.956 --> 01:42:57.637]  You know when somebody goes on Fox News, they plug their book.
[01:42:57.657 --> 01:42:58.578]  You know how that works, bro?
[01:42:58.598 --> 01:42:59.579]  It's not a one-way street here.
[01:42:59.839 --> 01:43:01.080]  She had to fly out there, dum-dum.
[01:43:03.140 --> 01:43:04.642]  And I read it and I was like, you know what?
[01:43:04.662 --> 01:43:06.884]  I don't care anymore.
[01:43:06.904 --> 01:43:09.187]  I don't care anymore.
[01:43:09.888 --> 01:43:12.751]  Because, again, I'm at least trying.
[01:43:13.512 --> 01:43:14.092]  And they're not.
[01:43:15.077 --> 01:43:20.341]  So, the power is in the person who's trying, regardless of the success.
[01:43:20.841 --> 01:43:23.122]  If you're trying, you've got all the power.
[01:43:23.443 --> 01:43:24.744]  You're driving the agenda.
[01:43:25.044 --> 01:43:26.004]  You're doing all this stuff.
[01:43:26.024 --> 01:43:31.828]  Like, I just introduced Green New Deal two weeks ago, and it's creating all of this conversation.
[01:43:32.008 --> 01:43:32.369]  Why?
[01:43:32.649 --> 01:43:34.490]  Because no one else has even tried.
[01:43:35.231 --> 01:43:36.752]  Because no one else has even tried.
[01:43:36.772 --> 01:43:38.853]  So people are like, oh, it's unrealistic.
[01:43:39.313 --> 01:43:40.094]  Oh, it's vague.
[01:43:40.314 --> 01:43:42.595]  Oh, it doesn't address this little minute thing.
[01:43:42.796 --> 01:43:44.337]  And I'm like, you tried!
[01:43:45.938 --> 01:43:46.678]  You do it.
[01:43:46.718 --> 01:43:46.958]  Right.
[01:43:47.459 --> 01:43:48.560]  Because you're not.
[01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:50.041]  Because you're not.
[01:43:50.841 --> 01:43:53.643]  So until you do it, I'm the boss.
[01:43:53.723 --> 01:43:55.024]  How about that?
[01:43:57.266 --> 01:43:57.786]  Look at me.
[01:43:57.826 --> 01:43:58.947]  Show it.
[01:43:58.967 --> 01:43:59.428]  Look at me.
[01:43:59.468 --> 01:43:59.748]  Show it.
[01:44:00.048 --> 01:44:02.250]  I'm the captain now.
[01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:05.352]  So until you do it, I'm the boss.
[01:44:05.532 --> 01:44:07.594]  I'm the captain now.
[01:44:14.807 --> 01:44:18.510]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:06.831]  This bar, at its regular price, is a little over $3.
[01:46:07.791 --> 01:46:10.932]  When we have it discounted, it's about $2.50 a piece.
[01:46:12.673 --> 01:46:16.274]  Comparable bars are between $5 and $7 a piece at Whole Foods.
[01:46:16.654 --> 01:46:17.394]  This is high-end.
[01:46:18.054 --> 01:46:21.295]  When you get one box, you get them at basically $3.
[01:46:21.335 --> 01:46:25.416]  You get them for $2.50 or so when you get it at the current launch discount.
[01:46:26.016 --> 01:46:34.466]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturer and developer in the country to get it all ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this.
[01:46:34.907 --> 01:46:37.149]  It's available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.730]  It's simple.
[01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:43.357]  You get the highest quality protein bars in two different flavors and you fund the war against the globalists.
[01:46:43.897 --> 01:46:45.078]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[01:47:37.633 --> 01:47:38.313]  to 3 p.m.
[01:47:38.353 --> 01:47:40.336]  Central, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:41.597 --> 01:47:42.678]  It's not just a show.
[01:47:42.698 --> 01:47:44.300]  It's a revolution.
[01:47:45.141 --> 01:47:49.786]  It's a pro-human mindset jacked into the universe of God's consciousness.
[01:47:50.887 --> 01:47:51.909]  It's next level.
[01:48:13.463 --> 01:48:16.186]  Everything we cover here is important, obviously.
[01:48:16.326 --> 01:48:17.327]  All your calls are important.
[01:48:17.387 --> 01:48:17.967]  All our guests.
[01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:23.212]  But today's next two hours...
[01:48:24.483 --> 01:48:25.003]  Here's what's next!
[01:48:46.482 --> 01:48:53.286]  How they publicly have the Defense Department and the CIA trying to ruin my life, and they have congressional hearings admitting it.
[01:48:53.726 --> 01:48:58.469]  We've aired the clips, and the average man I know goes, well, I better not get close to you.
[01:48:58.569 --> 01:49:00.230]  What type of coward are you?
[01:49:00.811 --> 01:49:04.193]  Those are criminals in the government doing that, just like the rogue FBI group.
[01:49:04.353 --> 01:49:05.274]  It's like 30 of them.
[01:49:06.654 --> 01:49:09.716]  We're going to let 30 rogue people in the FBI overthrow the whole country?
[01:49:10.037 --> 01:49:11.658]  We're going to let a few thousand in the CIA?
[01:49:14.195 --> 01:49:15.975]  And I don't, I'm not defending the CIA.
[01:49:16.796 --> 01:49:17.736]  It's unconstitutional.
[01:49:17.796 --> 01:49:18.516]  It's out of control.
[01:49:18.536 --> 01:49:20.416]  It needs to be abolished, reformed, whatever.
[01:49:21.937 --> 01:49:25.137]  But most people in the CIA actually are not for the New World Order.
[01:49:26.377 --> 01:49:35.799]  In fact, the police, I was, I kind of got tricked into early on, not thinking police were bad, but thinking the police state was bad, which I was right about.
[01:49:36.559 --> 01:49:37.460]  But that's not the police.
[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:38.560]  We're going to get one better in a moment.
[01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:43.861]  And then I found out, no, no, it's the cops that are more awake than anybody.
[01:49:45.295 --> 01:49:54.717]  One time they came over to the county conventions where I was yelling at them and yelling about this and that and the sheriff's department said, why don't you come over across the street to our headquarters?
[01:49:55.618 --> 01:50:03.360]  And I get over there, it's John Birch magazines everywhere and Oklahoma City and shot job videos and everything and they go, look Alex, we know more of this than you do.
[01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:04.220]  Stop it!
[01:50:05.637 --> 01:50:07.818]  Why do you think the press is always demonizing us?
[01:50:08.298 --> 01:50:14.479]  You know, if we do something wrong, we're not perfect, but they're doing it because they want to federalize us.
[01:50:14.979 --> 01:50:16.299]  And the feds are run by the UN.
[01:50:16.779 --> 01:50:20.400]  And I'm hearing all this like 22 years ago, and I'm like, and then later it all comes out and it's true.
[01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:24.921]  The police aren't learning about the UN takeover from me, I learned about it from them.
[01:50:24.941 --> 01:50:28.262]  And it doesn't mean the police are perfect.
[01:50:28.562 --> 01:50:32.063]  There's some horrible boss hog jurisdictions, there's some bad cops out there, we all know that.
[01:50:32.703 --> 01:50:34.003]  There's bad school teachers, whatever.
[01:50:38.223 --> 01:50:52.714]  We've come a long way, but this information about the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, Media Matters, Hope Not Hate is run by the same group in England.
[01:50:53.655 --> 01:50:59.800]  They literally interface with top TV producers at BBC, CNN, you name it, New York Times.
[01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:01.862]  We have undercover video from Project Veritas.
[01:51:02.262 --> 01:51:03.443]  They'll put all these videos together.
[01:51:05.726 --> 01:51:09.648]  And they go out and they pay people to lie about you, and they try to put you in prison!
[01:51:10.689 --> 01:51:21.335]  And then handbooks came out last year, where intelligence agencies are paying private groups to then demonize you, sue you, to make you look guilty, and then you just, quote, commit suicide.
[01:51:21.375 --> 01:51:21.935]  They kill you.
[01:51:23.336 --> 01:51:24.456]  But first they shut you up.
[01:51:25.057 --> 01:51:28.839]  People have to understand, folks, this isn't just demonized people.
[01:51:29.929 --> 01:51:33.712]  Deplatform them, take them off air, sue them, then it's kill them.
[01:51:34.173 --> 01:51:34.853]  Put them in prison.
[01:51:35.254 --> 01:51:36.014]  Tommy Robinson.
[01:51:36.835 --> 01:51:37.456]  Roger Stone.
[01:51:38.577 --> 01:51:39.037]  Myself.
[01:51:41.079 --> 01:51:43.681]  So, I'm not up here bitching, oh gosh, they're about to get me!
[01:51:44.042 --> 01:51:45.863]  I'm fighting them because they're bad.
[01:51:47.064 --> 01:51:49.186]  I'm risking my life because somebody's got to do it.
[01:51:49.907 --> 01:51:51.188]  But this shouldn't be hard.
[01:51:51.628 --> 01:51:55.252]  The instinct of Americans has become, let's kiss their ash.
[01:51:58.183 --> 01:52:02.704]  They put out these truth charts where AP is the most trusted, InfoWars is the most untrusted.
[01:52:06.725 --> 01:52:08.125]  Absolute ridiculous bull.
[01:52:08.406 --> 01:52:09.306]  Going back to Kaitlin Bennett.
[01:52:09.966 --> 01:52:15.647]  Kaitlin, we hit that break and I'm going to finish up the Logan Paul thing because it's kind of a plug for TurboForce.
[01:52:15.667 --> 01:52:17.048]  We need to fund the operation.
[01:52:17.748 --> 01:52:20.208]  And then later they attacked me with that clip too.
[01:52:20.248 --> 01:52:25.530]  But this is important because then we'll be able to reach young girls mainly that watch these guys.
[01:52:27.298 --> 01:52:33.761]  You just got out of college, but why do you think young 10 to 14 year old girls think a show like this is so cool?
[01:52:35.421 --> 01:52:37.922]  I think it's because Logan's funny.
[01:52:38.103 --> 01:52:39.083]  I think it's because
[01:52:39.798 --> 01:52:41.118]  They're all just goofy.
[01:52:41.158 --> 01:52:46.340]  I mean, his new little episodes are him with a midget, and it's his best friend.
[01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:47.580]  So it's funny.
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:48.520]  It's goofy.
[01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:54.262]  I don't know if you watch Cartoon Network, but the shows they have on now are just not shows that I used to watch.
[01:52:54.522 --> 01:52:56.363]  I know not shows that my mom used to watch.
[01:52:56.403 --> 01:53:02.164]  So the humor in little kids today has completely shifted into something that I don't really understand either.
[01:53:02.204 --> 01:53:03.484]  I have a 13-year-old sister.
[01:53:04.005 --> 01:53:08.206]  She likes all kinds of crazy stuff that I would never imagine liking when I was 10 or 13.
[01:53:09.346 --> 01:53:10.726]  So I think it's that.
[01:53:10.906 --> 01:53:15.788]  I think that Logan, you know, it's just he's always been around.
[01:53:16.128 --> 01:53:18.189]  He used to be a Viner and then Vine went away.
[01:53:18.209 --> 01:53:20.809]  And I mean, he's from Cleveland.
[01:53:20.849 --> 01:53:22.510]  He grew up in Cleveland where I'm from.
[01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:27.631]  So a lot of people around me know exactly who he is, how he is, and they grew up with him.
[01:53:27.771 --> 01:53:28.051]  So.
[01:53:29.332 --> 01:53:33.213]  So were they actually scared of you, a woman that owns a gun, or was that an act?
[01:53:34.304 --> 01:53:35.465]  I don't think they were scared.
[01:53:35.585 --> 01:53:38.266]  I think that they thought that I would cower.
[01:53:38.366 --> 01:53:45.049]  I think they thought that I would kind of sit back in my chair and just let them come after me and not have anything to back up.
[01:53:45.829 --> 01:53:52.152]  If you guys watch the actual, the whole hour and a half footage, they fact check me time and time again.
[01:53:52.172 --> 01:53:56.394]  And every time they fact check me because they thought I was wrong, I ended up being right.
[01:53:56.955 --> 01:53:59.956]  And afterwards they were like, you know, you're very poised.
[01:54:00.336 --> 01:54:01.176]  You're very calm.
[01:54:01.216 --> 01:54:08.859]  You had all of us coming after you about your opinions and the way you do things, and you remained there, calm and smiling, and you didn't get heated once.
[01:54:08.919 --> 01:54:14.280]  And I'm like, you know, the arguments that they threw at me were the same arguments I've been hearing for years.
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:15.601]  So I knew how to debunk them.
[01:54:15.621 --> 01:54:17.341]  By the way, I'd love to go on there and be fact-checked.
[01:54:17.361 --> 01:54:22.023]  You're like 95% of the time the TSA fails.
[01:54:22.043 --> 01:54:23.423]  Well, they've done that study over and over again.
[01:54:23.443 --> 01:54:23.823]  It comes out 90, 98%.
[01:54:23.983 --> 01:54:25.924]  And they go, wow.
[01:54:26.444 --> 01:54:29.105]  Wow, even mainstream news says 95% of the TSA fails.
[01:54:30.063 --> 01:54:32.085]  Yeah, because it's an internal checkpoint for the citizenry.
[01:54:32.105 --> 01:54:33.007]  It's not to stop terrorists.
[01:54:33.027 --> 01:54:35.349]  The borders are wide open, at least until Trump got in.
[01:54:35.710 --> 01:54:43.159]  And so, exactly, time and time again, they couldn't believe that you were telling them the truth because you work for InfoWars as if we sit here and make stuff up.
[01:54:44.184 --> 01:55:01.113]  Yes, I've been actually accused of making up sex crime statistics because I worked for InfoWars as I was talking about how 4,000 rapes have occurred because of illegal immigrants and the person I told that to did not believe me because they said that InfoWars was making up sex crimes.
[01:55:01.433 --> 01:55:03.494]  So the way that the media and the
[01:55:05.095 --> 01:55:08.017]  Just corporations are turning on InfoWars.
[01:55:08.117 --> 01:55:15.841]  They're brainwashing the public into believing that that InfoWars logo and anyone who's associates with it is bad.
[01:55:15.962 --> 01:55:16.382]  They're lying.
[01:55:16.402 --> 01:55:18.643]  That's because they knew it was so effective they want to destroy it.
[01:55:19.243 --> 01:55:21.825]  But InfoWars is just a symbol of Americana.
[01:55:21.845 --> 01:55:24.126]  So they can't kill it because it lives on through everybody.
[01:55:24.146 --> 01:55:33.472]  But expanding on that... So you think these guys really believe the stuff they're saying versus just playing along?
[01:55:34.488 --> 01:55:35.889]  Yeah, no, they definitely believed it.
[01:55:35.949 --> 01:55:38.391]  I could tell they're very genuine.
[01:55:38.471 --> 01:55:40.312]  They had their little fact sheet out.
[01:55:40.352 --> 01:55:44.875]  They had their laptops up looking at things that they wanted to kind of bring and spring on me.
[01:55:45.295 --> 01:55:46.696]  They genuinely believe that.
[01:55:46.816 --> 01:55:51.519]  I think that I maybe changed their mind a little bit on something.
[01:55:51.859 --> 01:55:59.865]  They definitely tried to change my mind on how I go about things or how I act in public or how I act when I'm doing my interviews or my videos.
[01:56:00.225 --> 01:56:03.347]  But, you know, the difference is that the videos that they make,
[01:56:03.767 --> 01:56:05.788]  They don't go out and face death threats.
[01:56:05.868 --> 01:56:09.489]  They don't go out and face people wanting to push them in front of buses.
[01:56:09.549 --> 01:56:10.489]  It's completely different.
[01:56:10.549 --> 01:56:11.650]  I'm exposing people.
[01:56:11.690 --> 01:56:20.332]  I'm exposing a complete, entire Democratic Party that wants to get rid of conservatives and put them in concentration camps on campus.
[01:56:20.372 --> 01:56:22.033]  They're going out and playing with midgets.
[01:56:22.393 --> 01:56:22.973]  That's right.
[01:56:22.993 --> 01:56:24.754]  You're on DrugsReport.com.
[01:56:25.074 --> 01:56:26.134]  You're in the real world.
[01:56:26.194 --> 01:56:27.314]  You're in a man's world.
[01:56:27.714 --> 01:56:31.095]  You're a woman in a man's world, and the men are acting like little boys.
[01:56:31.515 --> 01:56:33.635]  And I'm not trying to be mean to Logan Paul and all these people.
[01:56:33.715 --> 01:56:43.758]  It's just, I mean, I did watch about 45 minutes of it this morning, and I was just, it was just like, everything you were saying is like well-known facts.
[01:56:43.778 --> 01:56:45.678]  80% of the women coming up from Latin America get raped.
[01:56:45.818 --> 01:56:47.218]  Not here, in Mexico.
[01:56:47.558 --> 01:56:49.819]  That's Amnesty International, that's the UN admits that.
[01:56:50.993 --> 01:56:53.254]  I tell people that and they go, oh, Alex, you're Mr. Fake News.
[01:56:53.734 --> 01:56:54.534]  You're just saying that.
[01:56:54.554 --> 01:56:59.556]  So they want to inoculate people so that when our listeners say, hey, Infowars.com, they go, oh, I don't listen to that.
[01:57:00.777 --> 01:57:01.137]  Use that.
[01:57:01.197 --> 01:57:03.038]  Say, hey, why do they demonize it?
[01:57:03.897 --> 01:57:05.178]  What is it that you really believe?
[01:57:05.558 --> 01:57:06.759]  What is it you think he really said?
[01:57:06.779 --> 01:57:10.062]  Because I didn't say 99% of what they really said I said.
[01:57:10.503 --> 01:57:11.343]  And that's the key here.
[01:57:11.563 --> 01:57:15.727]  Go, hey, if it's so evil, if it's so bad, do you want to hear it for yourself?
[01:57:16.167 --> 01:57:17.749]  Why they're telling you you shouldn't listen to it?
[01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:21.332]  Because, you know, he's the guy that talks about people like Jesse Schmollett being fake.
[01:57:22.366 --> 01:57:23.827]  Because a lot of the time this stuff is fake.
[01:57:23.847 --> 01:57:27.389]  Caitlin, I want to come back and get into that university you went to.
[01:57:27.410 --> 01:57:32.513]  I've got the article here and the video is up on DrudgeReport.com here today and discuss all that.
[01:57:32.533 --> 01:57:34.334]  But help us finance Caitlin Bennett.
[01:57:35.415 --> 01:57:38.337]  I've got another 20 or so reporters I'd like to hire.
[01:57:38.397 --> 01:57:39.638]  I'd like to be able to fly around.
[01:57:39.658 --> 01:57:40.619]  I'd like to be able to finance.
[01:57:41.139 --> 01:57:44.561]  We cannot do it unless you buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:44.962 --> 01:57:48.744]  If you want soldiers for truth out there like Caitlin Bennett, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:48.764 --> 01:57:49.525]  A lot of great products.
[01:57:49.825 --> 01:57:50.846]  You're funding your own defense.
[01:57:52.315 --> 01:57:56.917]  You know, the worst part... Here's to the crazy ones.
[01:57:57.737 --> 01:57:59.078]  The misfits.
[01:57:59.898 --> 01:58:00.398]  The rebels.
[01:58:01.739 --> 01:58:02.519]  The troublemakers.
[01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:05.581]  The round pegs in the square holes.
[01:58:05.781 --> 01:58:10.102]  The ones who see things differently.
[01:58:10.142 --> 01:58:14.364]  They're not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo.
[01:58:15.905 --> 01:58:20.707]  You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them,
[01:58:21.593 --> 01:58:25.775]  About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.
[01:58:25.855 --> 01:58:30.918]  And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
[01:58:32.599 --> 01:58:39.443]  Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.
[01:58:55.973 --> 01:58:58.654]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[01:58:59.014 --> 01:59:04.896]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[01:59:05.456 --> 01:59:17.440]  Turbo Force from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[01:59:54.833 --> 01:59:58.934]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.454 --> 02:00:00.795]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:11.198 --> 02:00:12.438]  The preacher man says...
[02:00:17.129 --> 02:00:22.654]  I've got three daughters.
[02:00:22.994 --> 02:00:25.436]  Fourteen, eleven, and almost two.
[02:00:27.018 --> 02:00:31.102]  And when they grow up, I want them to be like Caitlyn Bennett.
[02:00:32.503 --> 02:00:35.085]  Smart, incisive, standing up to bullies.
[02:00:38.168 --> 02:00:39.890]  Knowing how to shoot a gun.
[02:00:41.089 --> 02:00:45.291]  Knowing how to run a trot line, and knowing how to be a mama, and knowing how to be a leader.
[02:00:46.471 --> 02:00:47.912]  And that's what the West has always done.
[02:00:48.832 --> 02:00:50.633]  We're the place that holds women up on a pedestal.
[02:00:50.973 --> 02:00:54.934]  And because the psychopaths know we have a conscience, they tell us all day that we're bad to women.
[02:00:55.634 --> 02:00:58.355]  But it's the West that puts women on a pedestal where they deserve to be.
[02:00:58.375 --> 02:01:02.077]  I can plow a field.
[02:01:03.197 --> 02:01:05.398]  All day long.
[02:01:07.519 --> 02:01:09.460]  But then you go and you look at those people.
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:11.120]  She must interview 50 of them.
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:13.521]  Two of them knew that Trump was the 45th president.
[02:01:16.561 --> 02:01:17.922]  But they all knew he was a Nazi!
[02:01:20.402 --> 02:01:22.303]  And Bill Maher talks about the left and the smart people.
[02:01:23.683 --> 02:01:24.783]  How they're the ones that are educated.
[02:01:24.803 --> 02:01:28.404]  How they're the ones that go and get all those educations.
[02:01:28.424 --> 02:01:32.285]  And I'm not knocking you to go get them, but statistically 90% of degrees are worthless.
[02:01:34.226 --> 02:01:35.507]  Caitlin, we love what you're doing.
[02:01:35.547 --> 02:01:41.551]  You know, we've been talking for six months with you and Millie Weaver, but she just had another baby, which is great.
[02:01:42.251 --> 02:01:47.095]  But, you know, that's where there's that glass ceiling, as women tend to have babies, which is great, which is the most important thing.
[02:01:47.475 --> 02:01:48.275]  Any mother knows that.
[02:01:49.076 --> 02:01:51.378]  So she's out of commission for a little while, but you can't hold her down.
[02:01:51.398 --> 02:01:53.999]  She was doing interviews until the day before she had the baby.
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:57.821]  So a second baby, that's great, with her and Gavin.
[02:01:58.321 --> 02:02:02.742]  But I would like to get you guys, I'm going to do a roundtable show, because it's hard to get reporters on the road a lot.
[02:02:03.102 --> 02:02:07.404]  We'll do it all the time, but I want to have Millie, you, and I think, I don't want to rip off Fox, but it's a good idea.
[02:02:07.424 --> 02:02:14.426]  I think you have like 10 women, and so the women can rotate in and out, do the show a few days a week, do it five days a week if you want.
[02:02:16.348 --> 02:02:26.537]  Have women and men rotating out and then somebody I think like Harrison Smith or something who traffic cops and just goes in and out of the brakes, cues up the clips and kind of produces the show.
[02:02:26.558 --> 02:02:30.841]  And I think we have a female producer as well, just as the producers, a lot of them are women around here.
[02:02:31.722 --> 02:02:32.363]  We don't think about
[02:02:32.663 --> 02:02:34.464]  As a man, a woman, we think about who does the best job.
[02:02:34.884 --> 02:02:37.384]  But I think we should try to launch that nighttime show soon.
[02:02:37.844 --> 02:02:40.385]  We've been talking about for, I guess, almost a year.
[02:02:40.945 --> 02:02:44.746]  And I know Millie got frustrated that we didn't launch that yet, just because we didn't have the crew hired yet.
[02:02:44.806 --> 02:02:46.046]  We've gotten that done.
[02:02:46.547 --> 02:02:48.187]  We've been a little bit busy fighting the globalists.
[02:02:48.207 --> 02:02:50.668]  But I just want to salute you and the great work you're doing.
[02:02:50.708 --> 02:02:51.668]  What's coming next?
[02:02:53.582 --> 02:02:56.445]  Um, honestly, I have no clue.
[02:02:56.525 --> 02:03:01.050]  The undercover at the UCLA thing kind of just happened out of nowhere.
[02:03:01.070 --> 02:03:07.998]  I bought everything the day before we flew out to California because I said, let's do another undercover thing.
[02:03:08.078 --> 02:03:09.680]  Let's get them to sign a crazy petition.
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:16.462]  And then my fiancé Justin was like, let's get them to sign a petition to put Trump supporters in concentration camps.
[02:03:16.802 --> 02:03:22.044]  And then I wanted to focus on abortion because I feel like that's what I'm most passionate about right now.
[02:03:22.104 --> 02:03:29.706]  So I did one for the concentration camp, and then I did one for students to support free late-term abortions on campus.
[02:03:30.386 --> 02:03:33.890]  And I only got one person to say no, I don't support that.
[02:03:33.990 --> 02:03:36.452]  Everybody else was all down for it.
[02:03:36.472 --> 02:03:38.614]  And it's all because you were wearing a rainbow outfit?
[02:03:38.654 --> 02:03:40.516]  And tell folks the name of your gnome to plume.
[02:03:41.677 --> 02:03:45.640]  So my undercover name is Jenna Taily.
[02:03:47.782 --> 02:03:50.925]  So I love how you're letting them know they were conscious right out front.
[02:03:51.306 --> 02:03:52.487]  Oh hi, I'm Jenna Tailya.
[02:03:53.007 --> 02:03:55.770]  Will you sign my petition to put conservatives in concentration camps?
[02:03:56.788 --> 02:03:57.548]  And they didn't get it.
[02:03:57.568 --> 02:03:59.129]  They just, they loved it.
[02:03:59.229 --> 02:04:03.350]  The first girl I interacted with was a girl that was on student government.
[02:04:03.410 --> 02:04:05.230]  She was a fourth year, she was a senior.
[02:04:05.770 --> 02:04:08.191]  And she was like, oh, I love, I didn't have to say anything.
[02:04:08.231 --> 02:04:10.992]  She came up to me, she was like, I love this, I'm queer.
[02:04:11.432 --> 02:04:16.213]  And I'm like, great, here we are with identity politics, but you're the perfect person that would support this.
[02:04:16.653 --> 02:04:27.003]  Come to find out, she was giving me tips and tricks on how to hide that I wanted to target conservatives and Trump supporters and put it under the name of diversity training.
[02:04:27.143 --> 02:04:35.971]  She wanted me to, she flat out said, yes, hide what you're trying to do, disguise it under this term, and then the administration will support you.
[02:04:36.351 --> 02:04:37.232]  Caitlin, you're awesome.
[02:04:37.272 --> 02:04:38.832]  Anybody can search your name for now.
[02:04:38.852 --> 02:04:39.973]  I hope you don't get unpersoned.
[02:04:39.993 --> 02:04:44.255]  You're on Twitter, you're on Facebook, you're on YouTube, and you're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:04:44.295 --> 02:04:47.037]  We salute you, and we thank you, and we'll talk to you again very soon.
[02:04:47.777 --> 02:04:48.537]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:48.597 --> 02:04:49.138]  She's awesome.
[02:04:49.718 --> 02:04:50.158]  All right.
[02:04:50.458 --> 02:04:51.179]  Hope for the future.
[02:04:51.499 --> 02:04:54.841]  When we come back, this is the big enchilada, folks.
[02:04:55.181 --> 02:04:56.181]  This could bring them down.
[02:04:56.582 --> 02:05:00.684]  Another Veritas-level infiltration of the Intelligence Crime Syndicate.
[02:05:03.627 --> 02:05:08.869]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[02:06:15.484 --> 02:06:17.429]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:17.570 --> 02:06:22.283]  The most demonized, the most censored, the most attacked broadcast in the world.
[02:06:23.809 --> 02:06:24.810]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:06:25.711 --> 02:06:43.947]  And joining us exclusively is a living folk hero, Tommy Robinson from jolly old England, political prisoner, the man that first exposed giant Muslim child kidnapping sex rings and murder 13 years ago, imprisoned repeatedly for documenting it and exposing it.
[02:06:44.027 --> 02:06:46.189]  Now the worldwide phenomenon is mainstream news.
[02:06:46.909 --> 02:06:52.896]  Thousands have been convicted in Europe and in the UK, but now it's coming here.
[02:06:53.537 --> 02:06:54.939]  But he made a documentary.
[02:06:56.016 --> 02:07:03.438]  Undercover exposing the incredible MI5, MI6 interface with so-called leftist NGOs.
[02:07:04.358 --> 02:07:11.881]  And suddenly, a day after it was released and got millions of views, it was taken off Facebook, it was taken off many other platforms.
[02:07:11.921 --> 02:07:22.924]  So this story is about censorship, about infiltration, about criminal espionage that makes the COINTELPRO of the FBI in the 60s and 70s and 80s look tame in comparison.
[02:07:23.504 --> 02:07:40.333]  So we're going to play large excerpts of this censored documentary, but joining us for this segment and the next is Tommy Robinson to tell us about the film, where they can see it, where they can find it, and clips of it are coming up, and then how it's just a continuation with the censorship all coordinated the day after it went viral.
[02:07:40.553 --> 02:07:41.534]  Tommy, thanks for joining us.
[02:07:41.554 --> 02:07:43.735]  No, thanks for having me on Alex.
[02:07:44.856 --> 02:07:50.399]  Please tell us about the film, the name of it, it's linked up on Infowars.com, and what it covers.
[02:07:51.459 --> 02:07:52.559]  It's called Panodrama.
[02:07:52.820 --> 02:08:00.003]  That's a name taken from the actual... The BBC have their flagship investigative journalist programme, it's called Panorama.
[02:08:00.603 --> 02:08:01.764]  Now, they were targeting me.
[02:08:02.444 --> 02:08:16.470]  Now, when I come out of prison, my PayPal was removed, my Twitter had been removed, I'd been unlawfully put in prison, and I was not aware to the levels or the sinister levels that they were about to go to, to try to discredit me to my entire country.
[02:08:17.455 --> 02:08:28.959]  When I found out that they were blackmailing people, I had ex-employees saying they'd been intimidated, blackmailed, they'd used leverage and information they had on those employees to threaten them into helping them bring me down.
[02:08:29.579 --> 02:08:36.081]  When that all became apparent, I then worked with another ex-employee to go undercover onto Panorama.
[02:08:36.602 --> 02:08:43.164]  She wore undercover cameras which got the lead investigative journalist for Panorama saying on camera,
[02:08:43.764 --> 02:08:48.746]  He would clip footage so it fitted the narrative of me being a dominant male.
[02:08:49.286 --> 02:08:56.530]  He would make it an innocent argument that we said we had on Dictaphone about a demonstration.
[02:08:56.930 --> 02:09:02.312]  He said on camera, I will make this into a sexual thing against Tommy Robinson.
[02:09:03.248 --> 02:09:04.489]  That's what he clearly said.
[02:09:05.730 --> 02:09:20.043]  And there was so much more in undercover footage which proved to the world the BBC work with an organisation called Hope Not Hate, who work hand-in-hand with the entire mainstream media.
[02:09:20.383 --> 02:09:23.746]  CNN, the BBC, The Guardian, The Independent.
[02:09:24.647 --> 02:09:26.569]  Hope Not Hate are working with them.
[02:09:26.949 --> 02:09:30.252]  In fact, the main man from Hope Not Hate, he actually sat
[02:09:31.535 --> 02:09:35.686]  On a documentary previously with Panorama as a director of it.
[02:09:36.989 --> 02:09:38.212]  And so I proved...
[02:09:38.883 --> 02:09:48.771]  Categorically, with evidence and with undercover footage, that the BBC were creating and inventing news in order to destroy and ruin me.
[02:09:49.171 --> 02:09:55.616]  And they were doing that in conjunction with a third party who are George Soros-funded, anti-Global.
[02:09:55.656 --> 02:09:59.239]  They attack anyone who speaks out against immigration or Islam.
[02:09:59.719 --> 02:10:06.905]  And my documentary went out 24 hours ago, it had one and a half million views, and today I've been deleted from the internet.
[02:10:07.745 --> 02:10:19.873]  And everyone who shared that documentary with major profiles, from Raheem Kassam, to Brian of London in Israel, to UKIP leading UKIP figures, have all been deleted today.
[02:10:20.554 --> 02:10:30.901]  Simply because, and I urge any American who watches this documentary, you can find it on my YouTube channel, Tommy Robinson, I urge anyone who watches this, this is the proof
[02:10:31.670 --> 02:10:32.671]  It's what we all knew.
[02:10:32.731 --> 02:10:34.473]  We know what the mainstream media are.
[02:10:34.674 --> 02:10:35.655]  But this proves it.
[02:10:35.855 --> 02:10:51.032]  With undercover recordings that prove their contempt for all of us and their willingness to discredit and change and clip and edit and lie to the entire world in order to destroy someone who's going against their narrative.
[02:10:52.452 --> 02:10:55.635]  Well, it came out in the British newspapers, as you know, about a month ago.
[02:10:55.655 --> 02:11:11.888]  Zero Hedge reported on it here, InfoWars.com reported on it, Tommy, that MI5, MI6, and then the German intelligence are interfacing and paying journalists to put out fake news, to infiltrate nationalists and patriot groups, to target you, to target myself.
[02:11:12.448 --> 02:11:12.988]  And so these are...
[02:11:13.869 --> 02:11:14.410]  We're good to go.
[02:11:32.805 --> 02:11:35.207]  Well, in fact, what you had with my former employees was a hope, not hate.
[02:11:54.033 --> 02:11:59.895]  Who work with the government, who work with the Obama administration, who are advisors to counter-terrorism.
[02:12:00.155 --> 02:12:03.897]  They actually sat my former employees down and said, we now advise counter-terrorism.
[02:12:04.417 --> 02:12:07.878]  Theresa May has just given permission for counter-terrorism to tackle the far right.
[02:12:08.218 --> 02:12:09.999]  We will put you in prison.
[02:12:11.014 --> 02:12:12.855]  And all of this I have on tape.
[02:12:13.295 --> 02:12:14.535]  All of this is recorded.
[02:12:15.195 --> 02:12:24.718]  All of these allegations, plus far more worse ones, is all on an hour-long feature-length documentary and film, which, when this has gone out, they haven't known what to do.
[02:12:24.798 --> 02:12:26.438]  For years, they've tried to silence me.
[02:12:26.819 --> 02:12:28.079]  For years, they've put me in prison.
[02:12:28.599 --> 02:12:33.161]  For years, Twitter, PayPal, any ability for people to support me has been taken away.
[02:12:33.181 --> 02:12:38.223]  And then now, their final punch was going to be Panorama.
[02:12:38.623 --> 02:12:44.485]  The reason they were using Panorama is Panorama is the most respected BBC broadcast in the world.
[02:12:44.945 --> 02:12:47.026]  What Panorama says is the truth.
[02:12:47.366 --> 02:12:49.207]  They are known for finding the truth.
[02:12:49.727 --> 02:12:56.290]  By having Panorama destroy me with false allegations which are made up against women,
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:12:59.581]  And again, not injecting InfoWars into this.
[02:12:59.621 --> 02:13:00.441]  We're part of the story.
[02:13:00.461 --> 02:13:02.262]  We have the exact same operations happening.
[02:13:02.742 --> 02:13:04.703]  They have NPR spending months, where I grew up in Dallas,
[02:13:16.906 --> 02:13:20.748]  And I thought they'd have some interesting stories actually going through my yearbook and calling everyone.
[02:13:20.788 --> 02:13:21.008]  No!
[02:13:21.628 --> 02:13:26.970]  They called me with totally made-up stories that I was a bully beating up innocent people.
[02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:32.912]  And then the school tied me up and took me out in the forest and knocked my teeth out.
[02:13:33.092 --> 02:13:34.593]  I've never had my teeth knocked out.
[02:13:34.933 --> 02:13:36.954]  And it was whole cloth not true.
[02:13:37.914 --> 02:13:50.662]  I mean, so this is the level, and I know they have private investigators trying to find women, offering people money, paying people, the Daily Mail to tell just insane total lies.
[02:13:51.082 --> 02:13:55.765]  This is their move on nationalists and patriots that stand up to their criminal activity.
[02:13:57.126 --> 02:13:58.187]  Oh, it's happening across the world.
[02:13:58.447 --> 02:14:00.768]  That's why I said I sat back and watched when it happened to you, Alex.
[02:14:00.788 --> 02:14:01.829]  Then it happened to Gavin McGuinness.
[02:14:01.889 --> 02:14:02.629]  It's happened to Milo.
[02:14:02.970 --> 02:14:03.790]  It's happening to us all.
[02:14:04.751 --> 02:14:06.572]  And the thing is, I knew this was coming.
[02:14:07.414 --> 02:14:08.395]  I knew it was coming.
[02:14:08.715 --> 02:14:13.543]  But even today, people who have put up I am Tommy Robinson, they've been warned and removed.
[02:14:14.204 --> 02:14:22.388]  The censorship is, and to be so blatant, for everyone who watched that documentary in the last 24 hours, a million and a half people, the outrage was there.
[02:14:22.448 --> 02:14:26.970]  People were outraged that the BBC, the licence fee, we pay for that.
[02:14:27.290 --> 02:14:38.675]  The public broadcast was working with Hope Not Hate, a far-left extremist organisation funded by George Soros, are working hand in hand to manufacture
[02:14:39.096 --> 02:14:53.535]  And exactly as you just said, one ex-female employee of mine is on camera saying she had to argue with them not to run full stories about sexual stories to do with me.
[02:14:54.286 --> 02:14:55.507]  That's how deep this was.
[02:14:55.907 --> 02:14:59.189]  And they know if they throw enough mud, it sticks.
[02:14:59.249 --> 02:15:10.875]  Tommy, I talked to people that were on the phone, known journalists who want to go public, about individuals on the phone with the lawyers, with one of the people that made stuff up about me in the newspaper, saying, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:15:11.195 --> 02:15:13.356]  People don't care if you got fired wrongfully.
[02:15:13.416 --> 02:15:14.216]  They want sex.
[02:15:14.697 --> 02:15:17.038]  Tell us he's tried to have sex with you because you're a man.
[02:15:18.615 --> 02:15:24.936]  It's not John Ronson that did that it was it was it was other folks but it's it's it's just getting insane.
[02:15:25.816 --> 02:15:28.177]  What they've done with that girl and said was he ever in your bedroom?
[02:15:28.477 --> 02:15:43.080]  I said well she said yeah of course he's in my bedroom at some point well and then said okay well we've gone back through footage and then he jokingly videos your bum and then they put all these things together and they're trying to run a story on it and she's saying you can't run that story but they're fully arguing those
[02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:49.185]  Let's be clear, you know about this because of good people inside the system being whistleblowers, and that's the Achilles heel of the globalists.
[02:15:49.225 --> 02:15:50.546]  They can't censor us all.
[02:15:50.626 --> 02:15:54.469]  Tommy Robinson with the bombshell film, Panorama.
[02:15:54.509 --> 02:15:59.673]  When we come back on the other side, then we're gonna play the censored film here for you.
[02:15:59.873 --> 02:16:01.594]  They haven't shut down InfoWars yet!
[02:16:01.994 --> 02:16:02.675]  Not yet!
[02:16:06.178 --> 02:16:10.141]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:16:12.799 --> 02:16:15.763]  Hey, I don't complain about it, but this is a real war.
[02:16:15.803 --> 02:16:20.008]  This isn't like your average show, like, oh, we're the cutting edge, oh, the Tempest-Bureaus support us.
[02:16:20.729 --> 02:16:25.556]  We are in absolute contention, in war with the globalists.
[02:16:26.587 --> 02:16:29.509]  We are taking them on at point-blank range.
[02:16:29.769 --> 02:16:33.871]  And if you go to the establishment hotels or go to establishment grocery stores, I don't judge you.
[02:16:33.911 --> 02:16:34.431]  We all do it.
[02:16:34.511 --> 02:16:35.452]  That's all you can buy from.

[02:17:07.818 --> 02:17:09.159]  How will the media demonize that?
[02:17:09.179 --> 02:17:10.941]  Oh, he sells protein bars now.
[02:17:11.061 --> 02:17:12.221]  That's not a lot.

[02:20:15.490 --> 02:20:17.631]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:18.131 --> 02:20:19.491]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:19.831 --> 02:20:23.353]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:20:26.414 --> 02:20:27.314]  Wired Magazine.
[02:20:29.875 --> 02:20:31.135]  Cover story months ago.
[02:20:31.875 --> 02:20:33.976]  He who will not be named.
[02:20:34.516 --> 02:20:36.057]  Saying I'm as evil as Voldemort.
[02:20:36.897 --> 02:20:38.857]  From the Harry Potter series, I'm the Devil.
[02:20:39.078 --> 02:20:39.958]  Leningradian headline.
[02:20:41.039 --> 02:20:43.481]  Alex Jones is going to destroy the world.
[02:20:43.802 --> 02:20:45.423]  He's the most evil person on earth.
[02:20:46.845 --> 02:20:49.867]  And it's an image of me being drug into the dark by a black hand.
[02:20:50.688 --> 02:20:57.695]  Well, Tommy Robinson is put in solitary confinement where the Muslims can shove feces under the door at him and where he lost 30-something pounds.
[02:21:00.481 --> 02:21:03.003]  That's what they do, and they're coming for everybody.
[02:21:03.303 --> 02:21:04.424]  But here's the good news.
[02:21:04.464 --> 02:21:08.046]  What they've done is so criminal, so over-the-top, so huge, that's what I've told everybody.
[02:21:08.427 --> 02:21:12.410]  Use Project Veritas tactics, tactics we've used way back to Bohemian Grove.
[02:21:13.110 --> 02:21:16.753]  You infiltrate any leftist group, they will be pedophiles.
[02:21:17.492 --> 02:21:19.535]  They will be devil worshippers.
[02:21:19.975 --> 02:21:21.497]  They will be just total criminals.
[02:21:21.897 --> 02:21:22.899]  You will not believe.
[02:21:22.919 --> 02:21:24.220]  You don't have to do any investigation.
[02:21:24.821 --> 02:21:32.530]  You just pose like you're with them, and if you act like you're a criminal like them, they will just open the doors up and you will just be blown away.
[02:21:33.251 --> 02:21:35.773]  This is a criminal group worldwide we're fighting.
[02:21:36.394 --> 02:21:37.394]  This is a spiritual battle.
[02:21:37.795 --> 02:21:40.917]  Tommy Robinson, we're going to air the film coming up in the next few segments.
[02:21:41.337 --> 02:21:50.985]  I know you've got to go take care of your children here in just a few minutes, but please join us again this week for a full hour because this is so huge and I'm very honored this morning when we talk very early in the morning my time.
[02:21:51.385 --> 02:21:53.687]  By going undercover on this organization, and by recording conversations,
[02:22:19.443 --> 02:22:22.867]  What we found is all the things they try to accuse us of.
[02:22:23.407 --> 02:22:25.589]  All of the things we found on them.
[02:22:26.090 --> 02:22:28.032]  We found allegations of blackmail.
[02:22:28.712 --> 02:22:31.595]  Blackmailing people to give negative information against me.
[02:22:31.916 --> 02:22:37.041]  Blackmailing people who had previously been informants, who didn't want the fact they'd been informants to come out.
[02:22:37.341 --> 02:22:40.324]  They used that as leverage to put them in a position they had to work with them.
[02:22:40.791 --> 02:22:49.545]  Then we had allegations that one of them, that then they made sexual advances and a rape situation on this individual previously worked for me.
[02:22:50.091 --> 02:22:54.973]  Then we heard, in undercover footage, a man who's trying to label me as extreme.
[02:22:55.413 --> 02:23:02.136]  The head of Panorama, John Sweeney, goes on to say that he worshipped and his political hero was Martin McGuinness.
[02:23:02.176 --> 02:23:04.377]  Martin McGuinness was the leader of the Irish Republican Army.
[02:23:04.798 --> 02:23:07.259]  He was responsible for bombing and blowing people up and murder.
[02:23:07.699 --> 02:23:08.539]  That's his hero.
[02:23:08.839 --> 02:23:10.760]  This is a man who's trying to portray me as extreme.
[02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:14.162]  Then it went on to find that he said he wants to shoot gays.
[02:23:14.662 --> 02:23:17.463]  He said that he referred to homosexuals as woofters.
[02:23:17.903 --> 02:23:19.683]  All of the labels they throw at us.
[02:23:20.623 --> 02:23:22.484]  And ten years I've had undercover footage on me.
[02:23:22.844 --> 02:23:24.104]  Ten years I've had cameras on me.
[02:23:24.444 --> 02:23:29.085]  Not once in ten years have they been able to manufacture anything I've said that warrants hate.
[02:23:29.625 --> 02:23:39.467]  In one boozy afternoon lunch of undercover footage against the head journalist for the BBC, I got every single label that they tried to put on us, he fitted.
[02:23:40.836 --> 02:23:46.120]  From homophobe to racist to extremist, all of them in one boozy lunch.
[02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:55.246]  So the point of these organisations that are working against us, and basically what Hope Not Hate do, they're funded by George Soros.
[02:23:55.567 --> 02:23:56.607]  They issue reports.
[02:23:56.667 --> 02:23:59.469]  I spoke to other gentlemen who have had great careers and great jobs.
[02:23:59.870 --> 02:24:06.134]  They issue reports and they name people and they throw all the big words in, the Nazi, the racist, the extremist, with no evidence.
[02:24:06.634 --> 02:24:12.239]  Then, when they want to take someone down, they work hand-in-hand with the local media or the mainstream media.
[02:24:12.499 --> 02:24:15.402]  The mainstream media then take what Hope Not Hate say as fact.
[02:24:15.922 --> 02:24:25.030]  Even though Hope Not Hate have proven to over-exaggerate hate crime statistics by 3,000%, all of the wrongs Hope Not Hate are now alleged to blackmail people and rape them.
[02:24:25.650 --> 02:24:46.177]  All of these things, and the media and politicians work hand in hand with them to destroy you, to destroy me, to use it as ammunition to put to the UN, to put to the government, to put across the world in order to censor us, to tell the social media giants, which is what has happened today, what this has proven.
[02:24:46.677 --> 02:24:58.624]  Panodrama going out and within 24 hours of me being deleted has proven the influence that these far-left extremist organisations like Hope Not Hate and the establishment working together have.
[02:24:59.224 --> 02:25:01.686]  It's proven it all.
[02:25:01.786 --> 02:25:03.167]  I don't know how they don't realise this.
[02:25:03.647 --> 02:25:05.648]  They keep beating us down, we keep getting back up.
[02:25:06.048 --> 02:25:06.929]  Will this stop us?
[02:25:06.989 --> 02:25:07.729]  No, of course it won't.
[02:25:07.789 --> 02:25:09.711]  Alex, I'm very grateful for the offer you've just made.
[02:25:09.751 --> 02:25:11.672]  I'd love to speak to you more about that.
[02:25:12.012 --> 02:25:13.993]  We need a platform in Europe.
[02:25:14.033 --> 02:25:15.394]  We've needed it for a long time.
[02:25:15.894 --> 02:25:16.294]  Like this.
[02:25:16.534 --> 02:25:17.135]  We need InfoWars.
[02:25:17.455 --> 02:25:20.116]  We need it for the European news on a daily basis.
[02:25:20.416 --> 02:25:24.418]  We need it for the news in Britain, in Wales, in Scotland, in Germany.
[02:25:24.458 --> 02:25:24.919]  We've needed it.
[02:25:25.039 --> 02:25:26.219]  You need a people's voice.
[02:25:26.239 --> 02:25:28.761]  You've already almost taken the country back from the EU.
[02:25:29.141 --> 02:25:31.362]  You're winning, we're winning, nationalism's exploding.
[02:25:31.642 --> 02:25:41.467]  If we can just hold the line, and if our listeners can hold the line supporting us, and magnifying by hand, by email, by text message, to share the films, and InfoWars can host them,
[02:25:41.867 --> 02:25:42.468]  That's coming.
[02:25:42.488 --> 02:25:42.909]  That's coming.
[02:25:57.849 --> 02:25:59.050]  You've already been a political prisoner.
[02:25:59.090 --> 02:26:01.211]  This needs to be parliamentary hearings.
[02:26:01.631 --> 02:26:06.814]  This is the type of thing that opening up could bring down these incredible criminal operations.
[02:26:07.014 --> 02:26:09.415]  This is what Soros did in Ukraine to overthrow it.
[02:26:09.655 --> 02:26:11.776]  This is what Soros does to create the Arab Spring.
[02:26:12.156 --> 02:26:15.438]  They're trying to create riots here in America, funding all this race-based stuff.
[02:26:15.658 --> 02:26:17.659]  You know Jesse Smollett was paid to do that.
[02:26:17.699 --> 02:26:18.499]  He's got accomplices.
[02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:20.821]  I told people days ago, others are under investigation.
[02:26:21.221 --> 02:26:25.483]  And now the police have come out and said, yes, others are under investigation above Smollett.
[02:26:25.743 --> 02:26:26.744]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:26:26.804 --> 02:26:27.644]  So, we're winning.
[02:26:28.025 --> 02:26:30.686]  It's hard for you and I that are on the front lines, and I know you know that.
[02:26:30.967 --> 02:26:33.989]  And you're not complaining, but folks need to know, we are winning.
[02:26:34.309 --> 02:26:36.510]  But for those of us on the front lines, it's very hard.
[02:26:36.530 --> 02:26:39.012]  We need your hopes, we need your prayers, we need your support.
[02:26:39.312 --> 02:26:42.314]  When we come back, we're going to air this censored documentary.
[02:26:42.554 --> 02:26:51.160]  Now, again, tell folks the difference between the BBC show, Panorama, the film is Panadrama, and how else they can see it.
[02:26:52.213 --> 02:26:52.854]  Panodrama.
[02:26:52.954 --> 02:26:53.855]  It's on YouTube.
[02:26:53.955 --> 02:26:55.918]  Take it and share it everywhere.
[02:26:56.258 --> 02:26:59.782]  It proves everything every one of you have been saying and thinking.
[02:27:00.063 --> 02:27:02.766]  It proves what Donald Trump said to the BBC.
[02:27:03.127 --> 02:27:04.208]  He said you're fake news.
[02:27:04.568 --> 02:27:05.790]  This programme proves it.
[02:27:06.371 --> 02:27:10.593]  This proves it categorically with evidence, with undercover footage, with all of it.
[02:27:10.853 --> 02:27:11.953]  It's got the full package.
[02:27:12.173 --> 02:27:15.174]  And I think it shocked them how powerful the documentary is.
[02:27:15.494 --> 02:27:22.017]  So all I could say is that people who want to know where I am, because I've just been deleted, www.tr.news.
[02:27:22.357 --> 02:27:25.818]  Currently, it's so people can still give me their information so I can contact them.
[02:27:26.858 --> 02:27:35.382]  The developments which are going to come and going to be built, whether it be webs, whether it be website, or apps, or with yourself Alex, then I will let everybody know.
[02:27:35.602 --> 02:27:37.282]  And that will be coming in the next coming weeks.
[02:27:37.322 --> 02:27:38.243]  Yeah, that's critical.
[02:27:38.403 --> 02:27:39.023]  That's critical.
[02:27:39.043 --> 02:27:44.145]  So again, what is the best place for people to find where Tommy Robinson, the person they're trying to suppress is?
[02:27:45.643 --> 02:27:49.585]  Sign up for free at www.tr.news.
[02:27:49.965 --> 02:27:54.027]  That will enable me, the minute we're ready with our new platform, bang, here's where we are.
[02:27:54.427 --> 02:28:01.051]  Go onto my YouTube account, Tommy Robinson, take the footage, upload it everywhere for Panodrama.
[02:28:01.351 --> 02:28:08.054]  Tommy, I know you gotta go, I've gotta go, but let's talk a little bit later when we get off air today about the next plan.
[02:28:08.094 --> 02:28:09.615]  God bless you, and we'll talk to you soon.
[02:28:10.762 --> 02:28:11.202]  Cool, Alex.
[02:28:11.242 --> 02:28:11.763]  Thank you, man.
[02:28:11.943 --> 02:28:12.363]  Thank you, everyone.
[02:28:12.383 --> 02:28:12.643]  Thank you.
[02:28:12.663 --> 02:28:13.684]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[02:28:13.784 --> 02:28:15.144]  And the same goes for InfoWars.
[02:28:15.625 --> 02:28:18.326]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:28:18.426 --> 02:28:26.431]  You've got to go give us your email so that we can get you censored videos, articles, and obviously supplement ads and things like that as well.
[02:28:26.491 --> 02:28:26.971]  Great deals.
[02:28:27.011 --> 02:28:31.153]  But it's about us being able to contact you and not have them get between us.
[02:28:31.313 --> 02:28:33.554]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:28:34.055 --> 02:28:37.937]  The video is posted panadrama up on InfoWars.com.
[02:28:38.377 --> 02:28:38.857]  Right now.
[02:28:38.977 --> 02:28:41.239]  Take that link from InfoWars.com and share it.
[02:28:41.279 --> 02:28:43.721]  It's also on NewsWars.com.
[02:28:44.101 --> 02:28:45.482]  NewsWars.com.
[02:28:45.842 --> 02:28:47.203]  That doesn't get censored as much.
[02:28:47.223 --> 02:28:49.424]  So get it from NewsWars.com.
[02:28:49.464 --> 02:28:52.286]  It's posted right up at the top of NewsWars.com.
[02:28:52.506 --> 02:28:54.548]  And share the link and get it around the censors.
[02:28:54.568 --> 02:28:58.370]  We're gonna upload it to InfoWars servers as well in case YouTube takes it down.
[02:28:58.670 --> 02:29:00.532]  We'll be right back with the censored film.
[02:29:00.732 --> 02:29:01.452]  Please stay with us.
[02:29:01.672 --> 02:29:02.253]  InfoWars.com.
[02:29:05.689 --> 02:29:19.496]  Now, I'm so excited about this, because they taste so good, they're so great, they're such high quality, and I can't wait to hear them try to demonize that we're selling high-quality, infused protein bars.
[02:29:20.096 --> 02:29:23.678]  We went to, again, three of the top manufacturers in the country.
[02:29:24.218 --> 02:29:28.360]  We said, we want to up the protein level, up the quality, even though you're already top of the line.
[02:29:29.100 --> 02:29:30.001]  We're gonna lower the price.
[02:29:30.702 --> 02:29:33.164]  At regular price in the packs of 12, it's $3.
[02:29:33.785 --> 02:29:35.947]  15 grams of protein is so much more.
[02:29:36.347 --> 02:29:37.528]  These are super high quality.
[02:29:37.568 --> 02:29:38.509]  No fillers, nothing.
[02:29:39.030 --> 02:29:43.334]  But under the discount we've got going, it's 40% off when you get two boxes.
[02:29:43.795 --> 02:29:45.396]  Instead of 25% off, it's like $2.40.
[02:29:45.456 --> 02:29:48.179]  Everybody's like running around the office.
[02:29:49.160 --> 02:29:52.662]  This is the best protein bar.
[02:29:52.762 --> 02:29:54.904]  It tastes better than candy bars.
[02:29:54.924 --> 02:29:56.565]  Your body's like, this is what I want.
[02:29:56.585 --> 02:29:57.325]  This is what I need.
[02:29:57.746 --> 02:29:59.527]  This is how you fund the Infowar.
[02:29:59.867 --> 02:30:10.495]  Instead of going and paying more for bars that aren't even as good in many cases, at Whole Foods or wherever, you get the highest quality, you get a discount, and you fund the resistance.
[02:30:10.775 --> 02:30:12.557]  It's a total 360 win.
[02:30:13.257 --> 02:30:14.338]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:14.638 --> 02:30:15.519]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:19.489 --> 02:30:19.970]  First time ever.
[02:30:20.330 --> 02:30:22.392]  I mean, this is what everybody said was their favorite.
[02:30:22.632 --> 02:30:25.394]  Tastes great, super healthy, super amazing.
[02:30:25.434 --> 02:30:29.878]  Get your InfoWars Life Protein Bars today at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3135.
[02:30:31.989 --> 02:30:35.492]  Now the media will say protein in food is evil in the snake oil.
[02:30:35.512 --> 02:30:38.074]  But you get 12 bars, 15 grams of protein in each one.
[02:30:38.415 --> 02:30:40.096]  Vanilla coconut is my favorite.
[02:30:40.616 --> 02:30:42.778]  We have the other right here as well.
[02:30:43.119 --> 02:30:46.041]  InfoWars Live Protein Bar, peanut butter and chocolate.
[02:30:46.381 --> 02:30:57.090]  This is a high-end, high-end protein bar of the highest quality at InfoWarsLive.com for about half the price of major competitors.
[02:30:57.150 --> 02:30:59.472]  And then your funding supports the InfoWars, a total 360 win.
[02:31:02.794 --> 02:31:07.997]  Discover the most banned broadcast in the world at InfoWars.com forward slash show.

[02:31:16.503 --> 02:31:20.686]  Everything that is broken today can be fixed.
[02:31:21.766 --> 02:31:28.491]  And every failure can be turned into a truly great success.
[02:31:55.592 --> 02:31:58.474]  Let me tell you something, you filthy traitors of the government, you pieces of crap!
[02:31:58.795 --> 02:32:19.912]  You are the most degenerate, twisted, mentally ill people I've ever seen wanting to gang-rape this republic that has been the literal cornerstone, the absolute jewel and the crown of free Western Renaissance societies and the very best literature, music, technology, science, medicine, culture the world's ever seen!
[02:32:20.092 --> 02:32:22.994]  You Satanists want to sacrifice the West!
[02:32:23.395 --> 02:32:25.016]  You want to kill the beautiful
[02:32:25.216 --> 02:32:25.596]  Not us!
[02:32:25.716 --> 02:32:27.598]  It is the West, you people are enemies!
[02:32:27.798 --> 02:32:29.039]  And we're gonna get your asses!
[02:32:29.299 --> 02:32:30.420]  And we know what you're up to!
[02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:31.541]  And we're coming for ya!

[02:32:59.490 --> 02:33:02.213]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:33:05.817 --> 02:33:08.460]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.298 --> 02:33:23.002]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[02:33:23.543 --> 02:33:25.545]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.685 --> 02:33:38.960]  Tonight, we expose the BBC with thousands of people outside their offices in Manchester.
[02:33:45.213 --> 02:33:49.857]  The British public do not trust you anymore.
[02:33:52.339 --> 02:33:57.443]  Get back!
[02:33:57.523 --> 02:33:58.123]  Get back!
[02:33:58.484 --> 02:33:59.144]  Stay back!
[02:34:17.247 --> 02:34:21.691]  Michael, he's going to explain what's going to happen next, right?
[02:34:21.731 --> 02:34:22.392]  I'm being arrested.
[02:34:22.452 --> 02:34:24.354]  I am being arrested.
[02:34:24.454 --> 02:34:26.236]  I've caused a breach of peace.
[02:34:26.256 --> 02:34:26.936]  I'm being arrested.
[02:34:26.956 --> 02:34:32.482]  The content of what you're streaming... The content of what I'm streaming... I'm being arrested for breach of peace.
[02:34:32.602 --> 02:34:34.223]  I'm being arrested for breach of peace.
[02:34:34.244 --> 02:34:34.964]  You've all watched this.
[02:34:35.144 --> 02:34:35.845]  You've all watched this.
[02:34:36.406 --> 02:34:37.166]  You've all watched this.
[02:34:37.547 --> 02:34:38.187]  You've all watched this.
[02:34:38.488 --> 02:34:39.589]  Can you get me a snitcher?
[02:34:39.609 --> 02:34:40.810]  Can you get me a snitcher?
[02:34:41.050 --> 02:34:45.972]  Since my activism started over a decade ago, the establishment, the police and the media have all been trying to take me down.
[02:35:10.748 --> 02:35:14.490]  The whole world saw me wrongfully imprisoned last year.
[02:35:15.231 --> 02:35:17.432]  Two and a half months on solitary confinement.
[02:35:18.152 --> 02:35:21.955]  What was the response by the media to that unlawful detention?
[02:35:23.015 --> 02:35:24.076]  They justified it.
[02:35:24.516 --> 02:35:25.657]  They lied to you.
[02:35:26.117 --> 02:35:28.799]  All of them reported that I pled guilty.
[02:35:29.239 --> 02:35:31.841]  None of them got the transcripts from the court.
[02:35:32.321 --> 02:35:34.282]  None of them reported the truth.
[02:35:34.983 --> 02:35:36.804]  We have a corrupt media.
[02:35:37.895 --> 02:35:46.798]  When I went to prison and 600,000 people signed a petition for my release, 30,000 people marched here demanding my release.
[02:35:47.058 --> 02:35:54.320]  When I come out of prison, I was completely unaware of the lengths that they were going to take me down.
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:35:56.582]  My PayPal was removed.
[02:35:57.142 --> 02:36:01.567]  That removes my ability to hire a team and work and bring you the other side of the story.
[02:36:01.767 --> 02:36:03.109]  My website was closed down.
[02:36:03.229 --> 02:36:14.981]  But I was completely unaware that Panorama, the world's leading investigative journalist documentary, were working on a program about me with the working title...
[02:36:15.882 --> 02:36:16.602]  Tommy Takedown.
[02:36:17.103 --> 02:36:18.683]  This was their final punch.
[02:36:19.183 --> 02:36:22.084]  They were about to discredit me to the nation.
[02:36:22.444 --> 02:36:23.885]  To you, the public.
[02:36:24.345 --> 02:36:28.267]  And I will prove that that documentary is not impartial.
[02:36:28.867 --> 02:36:29.827]  That it's scripted.
[02:36:30.307 --> 02:36:31.488]  That they invent things.
[02:36:32.048 --> 02:36:34.869]  That they lie, that they clip, that they edit.
[02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:40.692]  What you will witness in this documentary will prove to you this isn't about Tommy Robinson.
[02:36:41.112 --> 02:36:43.993]  This is about all the people that have been lied to.
[02:36:44.554 --> 02:36:48.535]  All the people who have been mislabeled, despite all their efforts to silence me.
[02:36:50.256 --> 02:36:54.398]  It become very apparent that something far more sinister was going on.
[02:36:55.698 --> 02:36:59.100]  With the collusion between the establishment, Panorama,
[02:37:00.802 --> 02:37:03.145]  And a far-left extremist organisation called Hope Not Hate.
[02:37:03.925 --> 02:37:09.051]  You're gonna hear about the tactics they use to get the narrative they want.
[02:37:14.336 --> 02:37:16.839]  In this documentary, you're gonna hear a lot about Hope Not Hate.
[02:37:17.881 --> 02:37:19.223]  It's important you understand who they are.
[02:37:19.743 --> 02:37:23.507]  Hope Not Hate is a so-called anti-fascist organisation who formed in 2004.
[02:37:24.649 --> 02:37:28.253]  They formed from a group and a magazine called Searchlight.
[02:37:28.693 --> 02:37:32.678]  Nick Lowles, who now leads Hope Not Hate, was a lead member of Searchlight.
[02:37:32.978 --> 02:37:41.225]  In 1984, Searchlight worked alongside Panorama to fraudulently edit footage which they were prosecuted or taken to court and sued for.
[02:37:41.285 --> 02:37:49.131]  They paid a million pound damages to conservative MPs who they wrongfully edited footage to link them with far-right extremist groups.
[02:37:49.351 --> 02:37:52.294]  Hope Not Hate brand themselves as an anti-fascist organisation.
[02:37:52.374 --> 02:37:53.615]  They're there to tackle fascism.
[02:37:53.715 --> 02:37:59.940]  In reality, they label, slander and attack anyone who speaks out against open borders or against Islam.
[02:38:00.200 --> 02:38:02.242]  The worrying thing is they have a lot of influence.
[02:38:02.842 --> 02:38:09.847]  For example, all media outlets across the UK, across the world, take what they say is credible and they work hand-in-hand with them.
[02:38:10.008 --> 02:38:19.735]  From CNN, The Guardian, Huffington Post, The Independent, Sky News, Newsnight, Panorama, The Metro, The Sunday Times, they even advise the UN.
[02:38:20.075 --> 02:38:23.018]  They advise counter-terrorism in their advice to the UN.
[02:38:23.638 --> 02:38:28.803]  They say that our Day for Freedom demonstration that many of you would have watched was a far-right extremist rally.
[02:38:29.023 --> 02:38:35.730]  That's fake news, being given as credible information and taken as expert info by the UN.
[02:38:36.070 --> 02:38:42.717]  Our Day for Freedom demonstration had homosexual speakers, drag artists, black speakers, Asian speakers.
[02:38:43.297 --> 02:38:45.039]  There was nothing far-right against it.
[02:38:45.279 --> 02:38:48.142]  It was a liberal demonstration demanding free speech.
[02:38:48.482 --> 02:39:01.468]  So what happens is when someone gets censored on Twitter for some kind of hate speech or for incitement to violence or engaging in some kind of terrorist communication, they get their account taken down.
[02:39:01.748 --> 02:39:09.512]  They tend to come back and that actually leads to sort of an increased level of sense of participation and integration into these networks.
[02:39:10.052 --> 02:39:14.694]  So I do a lot of work looking into right-wing extremism in the United Kingdom and the United States.
[02:39:16.312 --> 02:39:24.919]  And one of the things that we've seen there is actually an entire mobilization of right-wing extremist activity around the concept of the freedom of speech being taken away from people.
[02:39:25.339 --> 02:39:37.609]  So just a few weeks ago in London there was a march attended by a few thousand people that was called Day for Freedom and that was entirely sort of centered around this issue of free speech and the sense that
[02:39:39.150 --> 02:39:48.497]  In the kind of parlance of the extreme right, the liberal establishment was trying to silence legitimate conservative voices.
[02:39:49.057 --> 02:39:54.922]  Just last year, Hope Not Hate were identified in a Swedish military report on left-wing extremist violence.
[02:39:55.402 --> 02:39:59.624]  It has been proven that Hope Not Hate exaggerated hate crime figures by 3,000%.
[02:40:00.605 --> 02:40:12.772]  Nothing they said after that point should ever have been taken as credible, let alone taken by journalists without checking anything and spread around the world to demonise and slander people and organisations.
[02:40:13.092 --> 02:40:24.118]  They play a key role in pressurising social media giants, whether it be with petitions or requests from MPs that they're working alongside with, to say who's promoting hate.
[02:40:24.258 --> 02:40:30.080]  Not who's promoting hate that would breach laws in this country, but who needs silencing with their opinion?
[02:40:30.180 --> 02:40:34.362]  They're now teaching your children in schools about fascism.
[02:40:34.622 --> 02:40:38.063]  If we take a quote from their original spin doctor, Dan Hodges.
[02:40:38.243 --> 02:40:41.304]  From his quote, you'll understand the tactics they use in this documentary.
[02:40:41.545 --> 02:40:43.945]  It was a no-holds-barred, bare-knuckle PR.
[02:40:44.306 --> 02:40:50.448]  We used every dirty, underhand, low-down, unscrupulous trick in the book.
[02:40:50.768 --> 02:40:56.093]  These are quotes from their spin doctor, Joe Mulhall, who is a lead researcher for Hope Not Hate.
[02:40:56.213 --> 02:40:59.576]  He brags about days out with their BBC political reporters.
[02:40:59.596 --> 02:41:04.200]  Their relationship works hand-in-hand with the corrupt mainstream media.
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:13.527]  They do the reports, the media then use their ammunition and their labelling to attack people and organisations, to demonise them and slander them.
[02:41:13.547 --> 02:41:16.330]  In 2015, Joe Mulhall used the hashtag Antifa
[02:41:16.670 --> 02:41:17.771]  On several occasions.
[02:41:17.911 --> 02:41:21.672]  The reason why this is so relevant is when you understand who Antifa are.
[02:41:22.332 --> 02:41:28.335]  Antifa are an organisation that leading members of the American government have called to be prescribed as a terrorist organisation.
[02:41:28.835 --> 02:41:39.439]  They balaclava up, they mask up and they violently attack people who they're told to attack and organisations which are highlighted to them by groups and organisations like Hope Not Hate.
[02:41:39.539 --> 02:41:43.801]  They find out who you are, they contact your work, anyone who steps above the parapet.
[02:41:44.321 --> 02:41:47.323]  Hope Not Hate's goal is to silence them and stop them.
[02:41:47.643 --> 02:41:49.444]  This is about stopping free speech.
[02:41:49.764 --> 02:41:52.546]  This is about having people too scared to speak.
[02:41:53.066 --> 02:41:59.550]  We'll speak with one gentleman now whose life has been completely changed due to him voicing his opinions.
[02:41:59.610 --> 02:42:01.191]  He broke no law.
[02:42:01.491 --> 02:42:03.072]  Committed no crime.
[02:42:04.019 --> 02:42:06.201]  But wait till you hear what Hope Not Hate done to him.
[02:42:06.681 --> 02:42:16.229]  This time last year, like I said, I was working full-time, happy, and because of some things I was doing outside of work, where I was sort of expressing my political opinions and so on, I ended up drawing their fire.
[02:42:17.270 --> 02:42:21.554]  And they wrote a report and called it in to the employer.
[02:42:21.614 --> 02:42:26.578]  So it was a kind of deliberate attempt to... It wasn't just to dox me, because I hadn't hidden my name.
[02:42:26.618 --> 02:42:27.739]  I didn't think I was doing anything wrong.
[02:42:27.759 --> 02:42:29.281]  I was just expressing an opinion.
[02:42:30.221 --> 02:42:32.202]  Uh, but it was an attempt to deliberately get me fired.
[02:42:32.342 --> 02:42:32.883]  Where was you working?
[02:42:33.143 --> 02:42:35.224]  I was working at Standard Chartered Bank in Moorgate.
[02:42:35.384 --> 02:42:35.664]  Doing what?
[02:42:36.184 --> 02:42:38.506]  Uh, I was an associate, so I'd been there from a grad.
[02:42:38.746 --> 02:42:41.747]  I went to Bristol University and then went in for banks right afterwards.
[02:42:41.867 --> 02:42:45.269]  So I'd been there for about, just around 18 months at this point.
[02:42:45.529 --> 02:42:46.069]  So a good career?
[02:42:46.370 --> 02:42:47.010]  Yeah, it was going well.
[02:42:47.250 --> 02:42:48.731]  Internally, there'd been no issues.
[02:42:48.791 --> 02:42:52.893]  When you say, when you say you got involved, you was giving your political opinions with regards to?
[02:42:53.713 --> 02:42:55.815]  Uh, obviously the controversial stuff, so immigration.
[02:42:58.799 --> 02:42:59.701]  I'm good.
[02:43:02.250 --> 02:43:02.610]  It's time.
[02:43:02.850 --> 02:43:07.812]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[02:43:08.052 --> 02:43:15.594]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[02:43:16.615 --> 02:43:19.176]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[02:43:19.596 --> 02:43:20.936]  How can I solve that problem?
[02:43:21.336 --> 02:43:27.598]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[02:43:29.699 --> 02:43:34.603]  The Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology.
[02:43:35.023 --> 02:43:37.945]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[02:43:37.986 --> 02:43:41.568]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[02:43:41.588 --> 02:43:45.491]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[02:43:45.892 --> 02:43:47.593]  I've got two in my home.
[02:43:47.713 --> 02:43:53.337]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[02:43:53.818 --> 02:43:54.659]  Don't live
[02:43:55.479 --> 02:43:59.142]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[02:43:59.162 --> 02:44:00.783]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:44:04.412 --> 02:44:07.575]  Family was watched through Nest security cameras.
[02:44:07.735 --> 02:44:11.959]  And they hear this man's voice, they feel crazy, they hear it again, then they capture it.
[02:44:11.979 --> 02:44:18.765]  And then the guy's jacking with everything in the house, trying to kill the baby with 90 degree turned up heat, or turning the power off, or messing with everything.
[02:44:18.885 --> 02:44:20.406]  This is what you brought into your house.
[02:44:20.546 --> 02:44:22.748]  Why would you want ubiquitous systems like this?
[02:44:22.948 --> 02:44:26.091]  Well, because, you know, I can then watch my house remotely.
[02:44:26.151 --> 02:44:27.012]  What are you going to do all day?
[02:44:27.112 --> 02:44:27.772]  Oh, we got an alert.
[02:44:27.932 --> 02:44:29.774]  Oh, a deer walked by, or a stray dog.
[02:44:29.794 --> 02:44:30.975]  You spend your whole life just
[02:44:31.095 --> 02:44:32.517]  Watching and watching and watching.
[02:44:32.537 --> 02:44:36.140]  Don't have guns, but, oh, have lots of cameras, lots of cameras, which don't actually cut crime.
[02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:41.145]  I'm not saying cameras in and of themselves are bad, but these are two-way digital cameras that anybody can jump on.
[02:44:41.266 --> 02:44:43.108]  Like, whatever the biggest system is, always the worst.
[02:44:43.208 --> 02:44:45.270]  It's like, oh, I've got the biggest, I've got the best.
[02:44:45.510 --> 02:44:48.954]  You need a big, giant, red X on your ass.
[02:44:49.594 --> 02:45:00.106]  As I approached the baby's room and stood outside, I was shocked to hear a deep manly voice talking to my seven-month-old son.
[02:45:00.266 --> 02:45:01.167]  My blood ran cold.
[02:45:01.448 --> 02:45:05.632]  Arjun Sood was standing outside his son Oliver's door Sunday when he heard that voice.
[02:45:05.953 --> 02:45:06.633]  He burst in.
[02:45:06.894 --> 02:45:07.815]  The voice stopped.
[02:45:08.095 --> 02:45:09.396]  See, this is all tentacles for them.
[02:45:09.656 --> 02:45:10.377]  That's what you're gonna see.
[02:45:10.477 --> 02:45:16.701]  All the devices are gonna be used for all these demonically possessed people to then interface with them, and then the real hell's gonna begin.
[02:45:17.141 --> 02:45:22.725]  All their tentacles, all their weapons, all their surveillance is being put in, and then all you're gonna see is demonic manifestation.
[02:45:22.785 --> 02:45:23.825]  Demonic manifestation.
[02:45:23.845 --> 02:45:24.826]  This is the invasion.
[02:45:24.886 --> 02:45:25.746]  This is the invasion.
[02:45:25.766 --> 02:45:28.708]  He and his wife chalked it up to baby monitor interference.
[02:45:28.969 --> 02:45:31.690]  But once downstairs... Oh man, I was standing right about here.
[02:45:31.830 --> 02:45:32.851]  They heard the voice again.
[02:45:32.951 --> 02:45:33.431]  Who is this?
[02:45:34.632 --> 02:45:40.234]  An unseen intruder talking to them through their Nest security camera using obscenities.
[02:45:40.514 --> 02:45:48.478]  Asking me, you know, why I'm looking at him because he saw obviously that I was looking back and continuing to taunt me.
[02:45:48.698 --> 02:45:49.458]  It was terrifying.
[02:45:49.538 --> 02:45:55.500]  Soot says once his shocks subsided, he composed himself enough to record part of the ominous exchange.
[02:45:55.981 --> 02:45:56.641]  What's that?
[02:45:59.782 --> 02:46:05.485]  Sood believes the hacker also turned their upstairs thermostat to 90 degrees, noticing that the same night.
[02:46:07.266 --> 02:46:09.087]  A potential danger to their baby.
[02:46:09.167 --> 02:46:10.628]  And then they mess with our thermostat?
[02:46:11.048 --> 02:46:11.248]  Why?
[02:46:11.308 --> 02:46:11.849]  Who does that?
[02:46:11.869 --> 02:46:12.729]  Again, who does that?
[02:46:12.789 --> 02:46:13.690]  Get out of my way.
[02:46:13.730 --> 02:46:15.390]  I'm having a discussion with your child.
[02:46:15.410 --> 02:46:17.392]  How dare you interfere with me?
[02:46:17.792 --> 02:46:19.213]  I'm grooming your baby.
[02:46:20.413 --> 02:46:21.954]  I've been grooming it for a while.
[02:46:22.094 --> 02:46:22.834]  I'm a liberal.
[02:46:25.816 --> 02:46:27.457]  Children, we need to go downstairs.
[02:46:28.740 --> 02:46:34.023]  The suits unplugged their interior cameras, called police, and soon after, Nest itself.
[02:46:34.243 --> 02:46:42.749]  And then they said, well, you should have used a unique password and two-factor authentication, and if you did, you know, that would be that.
[02:46:42.929 --> 02:46:44.650]  But it's your fault, see, you didn't know.
[02:46:44.670 --> 02:46:45.771]  Let me explain something, Bubba.
[02:46:46.331 --> 02:46:53.155]  Amazon's got AI watching your butt, so you think that low-level demon that got in on there so it could stare at your baby is a problem.
[02:46:53.215 --> 02:46:55.296]  Buddy, that is the least of your problems.
[02:46:55.457 --> 02:46:57.478]  Real devils don't show their tails.
[02:46:58.098 --> 02:47:00.922]  Until they've got you hanging up by your toes.
[02:47:06.751 --> 02:47:09.354]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:24.142 --> 02:47:27.107]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:47:27.728 --> 02:47:29.070]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:32.008 --> 02:47:41.554]  This time last year, like I said, I was working full-time, happy, and because of some things I was doing outside of work, where I was sort of expressing my political opinions and so on, I ended up drawing their fire.
[02:47:42.574 --> 02:47:46.877]  And they wrote a report and called it in to the employer.
[02:47:46.937 --> 02:47:51.900]  So it was a kind of deliberate attempt to... It wasn't just to dox me, because I hadn't hidden my name.
[02:47:51.940 --> 02:47:53.041]  I didn't think I was doing anything wrong.
[02:47:53.061 --> 02:47:54.602]  I was just expressing an opinion.
[02:47:55.542 --> 02:47:57.484]  Uh, but it was an attempt to deliberately get me fired.
[02:47:57.504 --> 02:47:58.184]  Where was you working?
[02:47:58.204 --> 02:48:00.566]  I was working at Standard Chartered Bank in Moorgate.
[02:48:00.686 --> 02:48:00.946]  Doing what?
[02:48:01.507 --> 02:48:03.829]  Uh, I was an associate, so I'd been there from a grad.
[02:48:04.069 --> 02:48:07.111]  I went to Bristol University and then went into the bank straight afterwards.
[02:48:07.211 --> 02:48:10.594]  So I'd been there for about... just around 18 months at this point.
[02:48:10.854 --> 02:48:11.394]  So a good career?
[02:48:11.695 --> 02:48:12.335]  Yeah, it was going well.
[02:48:12.575 --> 02:48:14.076]  Internally, there'd been no issues.
[02:48:14.116 --> 02:48:18.039]  When you say you got involved, you was giving your political opinions with regards to...?
[02:48:19.201 --> 02:48:23.267]  Obviously the controversial stuff, so immigration, Islam, these kind of issues.
[02:48:23.327 --> 02:48:26.852]  But not in an extreme way, nothing you wouldn't happily say to anyone.
[02:48:26.912 --> 02:48:32.561]  Just so we can get clear, we're not talking about committing a crime, we're just talking about speaking openly about immigration and Islam.
[02:48:32.861 --> 02:48:34.343]  Yeah, and no one had a problem with it.
[02:48:35.146 --> 02:48:37.207]  That's the whole point that kind of strikes me about it.
[02:48:37.227 --> 02:48:42.228]  So it's not like anyone made a complaint, nothing's happened, so what did Hope Not Hate do?
[02:48:42.708 --> 02:48:46.870]  So Hope Not Hate, one of their, I can't remember which, but a team of their researchers wrote a small report.
[02:48:47.030 --> 02:48:53.652]  They were calling up multiple offices at the bank, and they were also focusing, because obviously we have a very big presence in the Middle East.
[02:48:54.272 --> 02:49:02.363]  So they were focusing on officers there to call them and just basically say, you've got this guy working for you, he's an Islamophobe, he's a racist, blah, blah, blah, all of which obviously isn't true.
[02:49:02.523 --> 02:49:08.491]  I remember I was just sitting at my desk and I get called in by the MD and he sort of says, have you been saying this?
[02:49:08.511 --> 02:49:10.374]  And I say, yeah, yeah, no, I have.
[02:49:10.854 --> 02:49:12.075]  I didn't see it as a problem.
[02:49:12.235 --> 02:49:16.638]  The same guys were going to a lot of journalists, trying to flog this report as well, to make a big story out of it.
[02:49:16.918 --> 02:49:20.540]  Eventually, in around the summer of last year, you get this article.
[02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:25.463]  It's very vicious, and it's obviously largely lifted from the report that came out a few weeks earlier.
[02:49:25.483 --> 02:49:30.446]  You know, using slurs, using kind of nonsense labels, calling us Nazis, all that kind of thing.
[02:49:30.466 --> 02:49:31.766]  Calling you Nazis, with any evidence?
[02:49:31.826 --> 02:49:32.807]  Was there any evidence in anything you've said?
[02:49:32.827 --> 02:49:33.507]  No evidence whatsoever, at all.
[02:49:33.527 --> 02:49:35.569]  It was made up with a very clear intention of
[02:49:36.309 --> 02:49:38.369]  Making me lose my job, and it is a common tactic.
[02:49:38.469 --> 02:49:39.190]  And you did lose your job?
[02:49:39.390 --> 02:49:49.692]  Yeah, I was suspended, and then, once the coverage happened, they obviously, whilst previously, like, internally, the bank, I think, had kind of thought, well, maybe this is just an attack piece.
[02:49:50.032 --> 02:49:52.732]  Once there was coverage, obviously, it's their reputation on the line.
[02:49:53.292 --> 02:49:55.693]  So then, pretty much immediately, I was fired.
[02:49:55.713 --> 02:50:00.274]  I have worked... Just so that the public understand this, you committed no crime?
[02:50:01.212 --> 02:50:06.516]  You speak, outside of work, about immigration or Islam, with no hatred.
[02:50:06.536 --> 02:50:07.136]  No hatred.
[02:50:07.156 --> 02:50:07.597]  Just facts.
[02:50:08.637 --> 02:50:10.699]  And because of that, you're... Where are you now?
[02:50:10.759 --> 02:50:11.839]  How's your life changed?
[02:50:12.100 --> 02:50:13.641]  What do you see for your future, now?
[02:50:13.881 --> 02:50:17.303]  Financially very difficult, of course, because it kills your income.
[02:50:18.264 --> 02:50:20.426]  And then there's knock-ons from that that are always a pain.
[02:50:21.226 --> 02:50:21.847]  OK, well, thanks.
[02:50:22.087 --> 02:50:24.588]  I hope you... I wish you luck to try and get your life sorted.
[02:50:24.709 --> 02:50:25.049]  Me too.
[02:50:25.609 --> 02:50:26.069]  Yeah, good luck.
[02:50:26.570 --> 02:50:26.790]  Thank you.
[02:50:28.820 --> 02:50:29.900]  So you've heard from Tom Dupree.
[02:50:30.361 --> 02:50:35.283]  You've heard how his life was changed simply for expressing his free speech due to the actions of Hope Not Hate.
[02:50:35.483 --> 02:50:40.785]  Later on in this documentary, you'll hear recordings of Kalen Robertson and George Llewellyn-John to see how their lives have been affected.
[02:50:41.665 --> 02:50:45.327]  Kalen and George used to work with me at Rebel Media, and when I went independent, they come to work with me there.
[02:50:45.547 --> 02:50:47.548]  When I was released from prison, I met with them.
[02:50:48.428 --> 02:50:53.050]  They said that they had been intimidated and threatened, and for that reason, they couldn't work with me.
[02:50:53.830 --> 02:50:55.011]  I'd just been released from prison.
[02:50:55.291 --> 02:50:56.311]  I wasn't in a good state.
[02:50:56.831 --> 02:51:00.313]  And I thought they were just saying that because they wanted to go and work with Lauren Southern.
[02:51:00.593 --> 02:51:02.194]  Also, you'll hear recordings from Lauren Southern.
[02:51:02.414 --> 02:51:04.935]  Lauren Southern is a leading political activist from Canada.
[02:51:05.255 --> 02:51:07.156]  She now works as a journalist making documentaries.
[02:51:07.536 --> 02:51:12.058]  In those recordings, you'll hear about allegations about how they've suffered due to the actions of Hope Knight.
[02:51:15.572 --> 02:51:17.753]  So, I've been contacted by Lucy Brown, who's an ex-employee.
[02:51:17.893 --> 02:51:20.894]  The last time we spoke to each other, we were screaming obscenities at each other.
[02:51:21.634 --> 02:51:28.856]  Now, she's been contacted by Hope Not Hate and by Panorama, who are working together on a project against me.
[02:51:29.476 --> 02:51:30.557]  Working title, Tommy Takedown.
[02:51:31.337 --> 02:51:34.078]  So, I'm on the way to see Lucy.
[02:51:34.118 --> 02:51:42.180]  I'm actually really concerned and worried about what it is they're up to, because I know everything they've tried to do to take me down hasn't worked.
[02:51:42.220 --> 02:51:44.381]  So, let's see what's next.
[02:51:45.638 --> 02:51:51.144]  Last time I spoke to you, I screamed some obscene, some terrible things.
[02:51:52.465 --> 02:51:55.849]  So did I. I also have a surprise for you.
[02:51:55.869 --> 02:51:57.090]  Go on.
[02:51:57.190 --> 02:52:02.056]  I thought I'd commiserate it, so I actually got your prison number.
[02:52:02.076 --> 02:52:03.177]  No, you haven't!
[02:52:03.217 --> 02:52:04.018]  To remind myself.
[02:52:05.706 --> 02:52:13.608]  To remind myself the happiest day of my life.
[02:52:13.708 --> 02:52:14.228]  What?
[02:52:14.248 --> 02:52:14.648]  82084 CG?
[02:52:14.768 --> 02:52:15.748]  Yeah, that's the one.
[02:52:15.768 --> 02:52:16.268]  Oh, my God!
[02:52:16.288 --> 02:52:17.129]  I laughed my head off.
[02:52:18.069 --> 02:52:19.829]  Oh, my God!
[02:52:20.590 --> 02:52:23.030]  Shit, Lucy, you were fucking angry!
[02:52:23.690 --> 02:52:24.931]  How have we ended up sitting here?
[02:52:24.951 --> 02:52:26.731]  And what are we talking about?
[02:52:27.634 --> 02:52:37.717]  Well, I received a very interesting email from one John Sweeney a couple of days ago, who is a big... Was it BBC presenter?
[02:52:37.737 --> 02:52:38.917]  Or... Panorama.
[02:52:39.237 --> 02:52:39.898]  Panorama.
[02:52:40.638 --> 02:52:41.358]  Yes, apparently.
[02:52:41.398 --> 02:52:42.138]  He's quite well known.
[02:52:42.978 --> 02:52:47.100]  And he's asking if I want to go for a... First it was a cup of tea, but then it was a pint.
[02:52:48.420 --> 02:52:50.681]  And he'll come all the way to Cambridge to see me.
[02:52:51.341 --> 02:52:53.542]  And I think he wants some dirt on you.
[02:52:53.562 --> 02:52:54.782]  You was approached.
[02:52:56.530 --> 02:52:57.071]  Joe Mulhall?
[02:52:57.651 --> 02:52:58.652]  Joe Mulhall, yes.
[02:52:58.772 --> 02:52:59.432]  Hope Not Hate.
[02:52:59.913 --> 02:53:05.757]  So you approached Hope Not Hate, who told you, I've seen what they've told you, they told you that there's a Take Tommy Down.
[02:53:05.957 --> 02:53:07.138]  There's a Tommy Take Down.
[02:53:08.058 --> 02:53:17.085]  Yes, and they've been taken on as sort of advisors to the BBC to help them with interviews and to get information about you.
[02:53:17.925 --> 02:53:24.110]  How easy would it have been for you to... They offered me five grand for a front page story about you being a twat.
[02:53:24.824 --> 02:53:25.364]  What you could have done?
[02:53:25.564 --> 02:53:27.065]  You could have absolutely destroyed me.
[02:53:27.445 --> 02:53:27.905]  And my life.
[02:53:28.285 --> 02:53:28.705]  And my name.
[02:53:29.045 --> 02:53:29.185]  Yep.
[02:53:29.405 --> 02:53:30.086]  And my reputation.
[02:53:30.546 --> 02:53:31.946]  More so than that prison number did.
[02:53:32.286 --> 02:53:33.747]  More so than me going in prison could have done.
[02:53:33.967 --> 02:53:35.487]  Because you could have said anything.
[02:53:36.428 --> 02:53:37.068]  And they would run me off.
[02:53:37.528 --> 02:53:41.689]  I've arranged to meet John Sweeney tomorrow at 2pm.
[02:53:42.349 --> 02:53:49.792]  And by the sounds of it, what these people do is they try and be your friend when you're vulnerable and they ply you with drink.
[02:53:50.192 --> 02:53:52.613]  And they try to get you to say something that you wouldn't normally say.
[02:53:52.633 --> 02:53:53.593]  I want to show
[02:53:55.320 --> 02:53:56.321]  What Lucy could have done?
[02:53:57.562 --> 02:53:59.484]  None of it would be factual, but what Lucy could have done?
[02:53:59.864 --> 02:54:01.666]  Now bear in mind, I might not have been here.
[02:54:01.866 --> 02:54:02.827]  You could have just done this.
[02:54:04.048 --> 02:54:05.069]  Fake text messages.
[02:54:05.109 --> 02:54:07.090]  Falsify sender numbers of texts.
[02:54:07.451 --> 02:54:10.033]  So if you wanted to, my phone would be here.
[02:54:11.263 --> 02:54:14.365]  Let's change the number there, and we'll keep that as we said.
[02:54:14.666 --> 02:54:15.666]  Let's put my number here.
[02:54:16.007 --> 02:54:21.851]  So you respected me as a disgruntled employee who fucking got in prison on a total deliverance.
[02:54:22.112 --> 02:54:23.813]  Joe Morgan's just messaged me.
[02:54:24.293 --> 02:54:25.014]  Let's take down Tommy.
[02:54:25.034 --> 02:54:28.016]  Fat broke, I've got no means of income, I hate you.
[02:54:29.037 --> 02:54:34.141]  Joe Morgan's just messaged me saying I can get you some money to do Tommy in.
[02:54:34.862 --> 02:54:40.326]  So I can go to fakemytext.co.uk and I can make you text me
[02:54:40.939 --> 02:54:42.920]  And then I can show... Panorama!
[02:54:43.521 --> 02:54:44.161]  My phone's here.
[02:54:44.862 --> 02:54:45.982]  I'm at home.
[02:54:46.563 --> 02:54:46.763]  Right.
[02:54:47.063 --> 02:54:47.883]  Minding my own business.
[02:54:48.304 --> 02:54:49.484]  I've got Joe Mulgrew there.
[02:54:49.524 --> 02:54:51.846]  Joe Mulgrew offering the takedown of Tommy Robinson.
[02:54:53.427 --> 02:54:57.850]  Offering you some money, and you have said to me... What?
[02:54:58.530 --> 02:55:03.093]  If you have anything to do with the Panorama campaign, I will fucking bury you.
[02:55:04.214 --> 02:55:04.834]  You bitch.
[02:55:05.895 --> 02:55:05.975]  No.
[02:55:06.806 --> 02:55:09.870]  Hang on, because I'm writing Y-O-U, but you write Y-O-U.
[02:55:09.910 --> 02:55:10.131]  Sorry.
[02:55:10.771 --> 02:55:20.525]  I just need to make up some bad grammar, because, um... Yeah, drop the T's, because I don't pronounce my T. I'm going to put W-I-O-V instead of W-I-V.
[02:55:21.499 --> 02:55:23.380]  Just to prove, I could have nothing to do with this.
[02:55:23.460 --> 02:55:24.340]  I'm not, my phone's here.
[02:55:24.360 --> 02:55:26.021]  So I've not sent you a message.
[02:55:26.061 --> 02:55:27.121]  And the point is...
[02:55:44.272 --> 02:55:46.615]  That they're actively searching with a far-left organisation.
[02:55:46.635 --> 02:55:49.558]  They're actively working with my ex-employees to bring me down.
[02:55:50.319 --> 02:55:55.484]  What I want to prove here is how easy it is, and how many other things in this documentary have been faked, only.
[02:55:57.967 --> 02:56:01.711]  If you had anything to do with this panorama doc, I'll fucking bury you, you bitch.
[02:56:03.334 --> 02:56:06.077]  Can you focus on that?
[02:56:06.157 --> 02:56:07.117]  So I didn't send that.
[02:56:07.598 --> 02:56:08.839]  That's sent from my computer.
[02:56:09.359 --> 02:56:11.061]  My phone has not sent you a single message.
[02:56:11.081 --> 02:56:13.763]  Now, Panorama are the biggest investigative journalists in the world.
[02:56:14.203 --> 02:56:16.105]  So I don't see how this can work.
[02:56:16.545 --> 02:56:20.909]  If they wanted to do a proper investigative journalist piece, they should look at the crime that I committed.
[02:56:21.270 --> 02:56:21.950]  Was it criminal?
[02:56:22.611 --> 02:56:23.692]  Did the judge act out a law?
[02:56:24.352 --> 02:56:26.334]  Was I treated, were my human rights abused?
[02:56:26.674 --> 02:56:30.857]  One of the biggest cases in this country's history, in fucking, in modern time, yeah?
[02:56:30.877 --> 02:56:41.846]  600,000 people signed a petition, 30,000 people marching, ambassadors from the American government, every political party in Europe talking about it, the most talked about court case in decades, and they're not bothered about that.
[02:56:41.866 --> 02:56:43.347]  This is fake, yeah?
[02:56:43.848 --> 02:56:45.269]  This is going to be falsified.
[02:56:45.469 --> 02:56:51.354]  This is not me, and I want to see if this, by a disgruntled ex-employee, could make its way around the world.
[02:56:52.054 --> 02:56:53.716]  I'd like to see how much power
[02:56:54.232 --> 02:56:57.073]  Hope not hate have over the world's media.
[02:56:57.493 --> 02:56:58.474]  Yeah, basically.
[02:57:06.697 --> 02:57:09.319]  This is the little money.
[02:57:09.379 --> 02:57:10.319]  This will replace your button.
[02:57:10.779 --> 02:57:10.939]  Cool.
[02:57:11.500 --> 02:57:13.040]  This will go into your button.
[02:57:13.060 --> 02:57:14.821]  Anyway, this is how we'll record.
[02:57:15.341 --> 02:57:16.762]  And... Are you nervous?
[02:57:17.782 --> 02:57:17.942]  No.
[02:57:18.183 --> 02:57:18.583]  You should be.
[02:57:19.643 --> 02:57:20.043]  You should be.
[02:57:20.704 --> 02:57:20.844]  And...
[02:57:21.806 --> 02:57:23.587]  Well, let's just wait and see what we get from this.
[02:57:24.548 --> 02:57:26.049]  Time will tell, but good luck.
[02:57:26.810 --> 02:57:29.952]  And don't do anything I wouldn't do.
[02:57:30.232 --> 02:57:38.038]  Thanks, mate.
[02:57:38.358 --> 02:57:40.119]  See you later.
[02:57:41.841 --> 02:57:42.361]  Success?
[02:57:42.781 --> 02:57:43.742]  Mission accomplished.
[02:57:43.762 --> 02:57:46.544]  Mission accomplished.
[02:57:46.824 --> 02:57:47.385]  Let's see.
[02:57:57.333 --> 02:57:58.654]  Here's the thing, I'm not giving up.
[02:57:59.374 --> 02:58:04.016]  Because I know we've got truth and justice on our side, but it takes money to wage this war.
[02:58:04.377 --> 02:58:08.098]  You're spreading the word, you're praying for us, and you're financially supporting us.
[02:58:08.178 --> 02:58:11.440]  It's key, it's essential, it's absolute like oxygen.
[02:58:11.740 --> 02:58:14.622]  We have to have it, and we've got great products you already need.
[02:58:14.642 --> 02:58:15.702]  I mean, take fish oil.
[02:58:15.762 --> 02:58:17.883]  What it does for your heart, your brain, energy.
[02:58:17.923 --> 02:58:19.524]  I don't even usually take a nootropic.
[02:58:19.644 --> 02:58:25.247]  If I'm up at 10 o'clock at night, and I gotta work till 3am on Coast to Coast AM or some show, I pop five fish oils.
[02:58:25.567 --> 02:58:27.049]  Nobody calls fish oil nootropic.
[02:58:27.609 --> 02:58:28.771]  Your brain's electrochemical.
[02:58:28.931 --> 02:58:31.173]  It's basically made out of what fish oil is.
[02:58:31.373 --> 02:58:32.755]  Fish oil is what floats my boat.
[02:58:33.676 --> 02:58:34.957]  I mean, I take it every morning right now.
[02:58:35.178 --> 02:58:36.599]  First thing I get up at 6 a.m.
[02:58:36.719 --> 02:58:39.863]  with my coffee, I bang back three big old fat juicy fish oils.
[02:58:40.203 --> 02:58:42.045]  And so our ultimate krill oil.
[02:58:42.265 --> 02:58:45.407]  It's even better than the fish oil, what it does for your brain, but there's no way to denature it.
[02:58:45.467 --> 02:58:48.808]  It gives you the burps, I'm not gonna lie to you, but if you can deal with it, it's it's it.
[02:58:48.869 --> 02:58:50.990]  The ultimate krill oil is rocket fuel, baby.
[02:58:51.130 --> 02:58:52.370]  I mean, it's the next level.
[02:58:52.490 --> 02:58:55.252]  Ultimate fish oil, all crafted out of fjords, amazing.
[02:58:55.272 --> 02:58:57.613]  Doesn't give you the burpees, neither does honor roll.
[02:58:57.773 --> 02:59:00.475]  It's amazing for your kids, small caplets, but I tend to like honor roll.
[02:59:00.575 --> 02:59:02.396]  Okay, I'm a fish oil addict, I'm not gonna lie.
[02:59:02.516 --> 02:59:03.396]  I gobble the stuff.
[02:59:03.616 --> 02:59:04.957]  Coffee's a thing of the past now.
[02:59:05.397 --> 02:59:06.618]  Brain force is a thing of the past.
[02:59:06.798 --> 02:59:08.359]  And for different people, different things.
[02:59:09.252 --> 02:59:12.256]  I'm just telling you fish oil is numero uno.
[02:59:12.837 --> 02:59:15.961]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or AAA253-3139.
[02:59:23.544 --> 02:59:26.025]  It uses a medicinal herb of thousands of years, turmeric.
[02:59:26.085 --> 02:59:28.266]  It's one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[02:59:28.646 --> 02:59:33.967]  It is there for the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support.
[02:59:34.207 --> 02:59:42.310]  And it's got the turmeric root extract, the boswellia serrata extract, organic spearmint, sage, lemon balm, thyme leaves, and piperine from black pepper.
[02:59:42.670 --> 02:59:47.592]  It will help you take control of your body and feel the power of turmeric like never before.

[02:59:54.611 --> 03:00:00.553]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:06.275 --> 03:00:12.518]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.606 --> 03:00:16.587]  Alex Jones joins us.
[03:00:16.607 --> 03:00:17.147]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:17.547 --> 03:00:17.827]  Hey, man.
[03:00:17.847 --> 03:00:18.868]  Yeah, it's good to be here with you.
[03:00:19.028 --> 03:00:22.170]  Okay, so, um... Why don't you quit?
[03:00:22.590 --> 03:00:23.691]  I mean, I don't want you to quit.
[03:00:23.971 --> 03:00:28.254]  I like living in a world where we have, you know, all kinds of people talking.
[03:00:28.354 --> 03:00:29.895]  I really... I'm a free speech guy.
[03:00:29.915 --> 03:00:31.196]  I got a free speech tattoo.
[03:00:31.616 --> 03:00:35.278]  And I think, you know, the most outlandish stuff should be protected.
[03:00:35.558 --> 03:00:38.280]  We don't need free speech for ABC, CBS, NBC.
[03:00:38.620 --> 03:00:40.121]  They're already fine.
[03:00:40.261 --> 03:00:42.763]  We need free speech for some of the fringe people.
[03:00:43.463 --> 03:00:50.546]  That's right, but because the fringe has become dominant, we're being taken off the air because we do threaten the ABCs and the NFL.
[03:00:50.566 --> 03:00:56.388]  Look, the NFL wanted to force-feed all its anti-American garbage for three years and take knees, and it wounded them.
[03:00:56.688 --> 03:01:00.689]  They lost 30 to 40 percent of their audience, and that's what the numbers show.
[03:01:00.970 --> 03:01:02.270]  People are tuning out of it.
[03:01:02.330 --> 03:01:07.092]  So, they established the things that they take us off the air, that suddenly people will go back to watching them.
[03:01:07.192 --> 03:01:07.412]  No.
[03:01:07.852 --> 03:01:09.273]  Competition has now been entered.
[03:01:09.393 --> 03:01:10.713]  The internet is now out there.
[03:01:10.933 --> 03:01:12.294]  They'll never be able to shut it all down.
[03:01:12.394 --> 03:01:12.874]  It's over.
[03:01:13.434 --> 03:01:15.496]  The old guard, the old establishment is done.
[03:01:15.816 --> 03:01:18.938]  You know, I won't watch the NFL anymore, and I won't participate.
[03:01:19.418 --> 03:01:23.401]  I did bet on the game and make some money, but, but, um, what, what are they trying?
[03:01:23.641 --> 03:01:25.182]  They wouldn't do anything that's pro-American.
[03:01:25.202 --> 03:01:28.505]  Uh, what, what, what are they trying to promote, Alex?
[03:01:28.525 --> 03:01:36.570]  I don't understand it, with the kneeling and the anti-cop sentiment, and, and, uh, they wouldn't accept military ads, some anti-military, anti-anything patriotic they don't like.
[03:01:37.030 --> 03:01:38.571]  So what does the NFL stand for now?
[03:01:39.532 --> 03:01:40.733]  You were on my show last week.
[03:01:41.576 --> 03:01:43.177]  And I said, what do you want to talk about first?
[03:01:43.197 --> 03:01:45.699]  You've been off the air for a year and we appreciate you coming back.
[03:01:46.120 --> 03:01:48.822]  You said, I want to talk about how people love Americana overseas.
[03:01:49.382 --> 03:01:51.184]  I want to talk about how they want that back.
[03:01:51.204 --> 03:01:52.445]  They've already been under socialism.
[03:01:53.405 --> 03:01:54.927]  And that's why they're trying to ban me as well.
[03:01:55.427 --> 03:01:56.288]  You hit the nail on the head.
[03:01:56.748 --> 03:01:59.410]  They can't allow classic Americana to be around.
[03:01:59.750 --> 03:02:00.351]  Real freedom.
[03:02:00.951 --> 03:02:02.573]  ...competing in this new global order.
[03:02:02.593 --> 03:02:03.954]  They want to demoralize America.
[03:02:04.254 --> 03:02:05.535]  They want to make us hate our country.
[03:02:05.836 --> 03:02:07.417]  That's what you do when you're taking a country over.
[03:02:07.898 --> 03:02:10.060]  I mean, they say Trump can't say that we're a nation.
[03:02:10.280 --> 03:02:12.262]  That nation is a dirty word.
[03:02:12.622 --> 03:02:13.943]  That's what globalism does.
[03:02:13.983 --> 03:02:21.530]  Well, the word man... The word man, I mean, saying being a man is somehow vile and sexist or something.
[03:02:21.670 --> 03:02:23.132]  You can't say being a man to somebody.
[03:02:23.959 --> 03:02:27.782]  Google is now saying they're going to auto-correct me trying to type in the word family.
[03:02:28.243 --> 03:02:29.403]  They're saying that's a hurtful word.
[03:02:29.423 --> 03:02:30.164]  It's crazy.
[03:02:30.284 --> 03:02:31.145]  I'm not kidding.
[03:02:31.165 --> 03:02:32.586]  Well, it takes a village, right?
[03:02:32.626 --> 03:02:34.888]  We're in the middle of a total takeover, my friend.
[03:02:35.568 --> 03:02:40.533]  With all the censorship, all the controls, all the insanity, it's happening right now.
[03:02:40.853 --> 03:02:43.675]  And other people are conforming to the censorship so they don't get censored.
[03:02:43.935 --> 03:02:50.220]  Well, I'm proud to be one of the most banned censored people in world history because the truth of what I've said is going to come out one way or another.
[03:02:50.240 --> 03:02:50.841]  That's why I'm really
[03:02:50.981 --> 03:02:59.245]  I've been pleased to be on the air with you here in the great city of Chicago today to set the record straight for all the disinfo that's out there.
[03:02:59.505 --> 03:03:01.465]  I mean, you've been on my show probably 30, 40, 50 times.
[03:03:01.546 --> 03:03:04.187]  I've been on your show probably 100 times over the years.
[03:03:04.207 --> 03:03:04.827]  We've hung out.
[03:03:04.847 --> 03:03:05.427]  We've done everything.
[03:03:05.887 --> 03:03:07.148]  I mean, you've been in movies.
[03:03:07.488 --> 03:03:10.609]  It doesn't mean that when you go on the air now you're being an actor and you're being fake.
[03:03:10.849 --> 03:03:11.430]  You're a father.
[03:03:11.470 --> 03:03:12.570]  You're a patriot.
[03:03:12.630 --> 03:03:13.291]  It's the same with me.
[03:03:13.311 --> 03:03:18.313]  It's just asinine to go, oh look, Alex is in a couple movies with Keanu Reeves and
[03:03:19.253 --> 03:03:21.215]  How often do you talk to President Trump?
[03:03:21.235 --> 03:03:23.917]  Does Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, have undue influence over him?
[03:03:43.115 --> 03:03:46.918]  You know, that the Clintons passed to give black people three times the sentence of white people.
[03:03:46.938 --> 03:03:48.380]  I think that's a good thing Trump did.
[03:03:48.400 --> 03:03:56.247]  I think pulling out of Afghanistan, where we've been for years... Alex, Alex, that may have come off the way you didn't mean it to come off.
[03:03:56.267 --> 03:04:01.152]  To me, it sounded like you were saying African Americans should have longer sentences than white people.
[03:04:01.432 --> 03:04:02.273]  No, that's not what I said.
[03:04:02.493 --> 03:04:05.596]  Well, I know, but just, that's what I... Maybe I misheard.
[03:04:05.856 --> 03:04:06.877]  And I know that's not what you meant.
[03:04:08.217 --> 03:04:10.797]  No, it was Hillary Clinton that said that black people are dogs.
[03:04:10.818 --> 03:04:11.318]  They need to be learned.
[03:04:11.378 --> 03:04:13.238]  Super predators, she called them.
[03:04:13.278 --> 03:04:15.878]  Black men are super predators, she said.
[03:04:16.339 --> 03:04:17.179]  Yes, yes, yes.
[03:04:17.339 --> 03:04:30.781]  So I'm talking about she got a law passed in 93 with Bill Clinton to get black people three times the sentences of white people, and Trump just reversed that and got no support or no praise from the so-called leftist black leaders, okay?
[03:04:31.241 --> 03:04:34.382]  And Trump's pulling our troops out of these countries where they've been for 18 years
[03:04:35.522 --> 03:04:40.866]  And he's not getting any praise for that from the left who now are polled in national polls.
[03:04:40.886 --> 03:04:48.151]  54% of Democrats want more wars now and more dead troops for no reason because Trump's against it.
[03:04:48.351 --> 03:04:50.112]  They have gone completely insane.
[03:04:55.436 --> 03:04:59.599]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:05:00.360 --> 03:05:01.781]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:05:03.545 --> 03:05:09.429]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[03:06:05.296 --> 03:06:11.602]  This transmission is coming to you.
[03:06:11.662 --> 03:06:15.787]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:16.067 --> 03:06:21.712]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:06:33.560 --> 03:06:35.761]  Is the NRA a good organization?
[03:06:35.821 --> 03:06:40.824]  I think the NRA overall is a very good organization.
[03:06:40.864 --> 03:06:44.807]  I don't think they're hardcore enough sometimes.
[03:06:52.068 --> 03:06:53.549]  But I love Ted Nugent and the work he does.
[03:06:53.589 --> 03:06:54.290]  They're on their board.
[03:06:54.310 --> 03:06:56.912]  And I don't think they should ban bump stocks.
[03:06:56.952 --> 03:06:59.634]  I don't think they should restrict good people having firearms.
[03:06:59.674 --> 03:07:00.695]  They should go after criminals.
[03:07:01.176 --> 03:07:03.277]  Can Trump get re-elected if we don't have a wall?
[03:07:03.798 --> 03:07:07.261]  You know, Trump... Trump has made everything about this wall, and that's great.
[03:07:07.781 --> 03:07:16.268]  But I think more important than the wall is he needs to not give all these illegal aliens amnesty that have gotten here illegally, because that only encourages more to do it.
[03:07:16.789 --> 03:07:18.310]  And, you know, they vote, like, 60, 70 percent.
[03:07:20.331 --> 03:07:20.991]  For Democrats.
[03:07:21.852 --> 03:07:26.974]  And so the Democrats are importing unskilled people to the country.
[03:07:27.554 --> 03:07:28.754]  It's what Trump said three years ago.
[03:07:28.774 --> 03:07:29.915]  They're not sending their doctors.
[03:07:30.235 --> 03:07:31.655]  They're not sending their scientists.
[03:07:32.016 --> 03:07:38.098]  They're sending their poorest, lowest IQ people who've been indoctrinated into socialism.
[03:07:39.298 --> 03:07:40.619]  A lot of them are from Venezuela.
[03:07:40.779 --> 03:07:43.280]  I mean, literally communist brainwashed people.
[03:07:43.680 --> 03:07:46.181]  And when they get here, they're coming because they want more free goodies.
[03:07:46.741 --> 03:07:48.282]  And they've already made Venezuela collapse.
[03:07:49.531 --> 03:07:58.008]  I think Trump needs to hold fast, and yes, build wall in key areas, but the media has made it about, oh, if he can't do it, he's broken his promise.
[03:07:58.489 --> 03:08:00.533]  Trump did so many of the things he said he would do.
[03:08:01.952 --> 03:08:06.455]  And, you know, he got the economy to turn back on, but then they raised interest rates seven times on him.
[03:08:06.835 --> 03:08:08.777]  They never raised interest rates under Obama.
[03:08:08.797 --> 03:08:10.278]  They did that to kill the recovery.
[03:08:10.538 --> 03:08:11.859]  Yeah, boy, it did feel like that.
[03:08:11.899 --> 03:08:19.924]  I'll tell you, I bought a few stocks and was doing quite well, and they were doing everything they could to... And who is this?
[03:08:19.964 --> 03:08:20.284]  The Fed?
[03:08:20.325 --> 03:08:22.406]  Is this, you know, to tank our economy?
[03:08:22.426 --> 03:08:24.427]  The Federal Reserve, yes.
[03:08:25.228 --> 03:08:29.751]  And who runs... Alex, who runs... The Federal Reserve, as you've explained to me, is not part of our government.
[03:08:30.572 --> 03:08:31.832]  Okay, there's two parts to the Federal Reserve.
[03:08:31.852 --> 03:08:43.597]  There's the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 that established 12 regional banks that are run by board members of other large private banks, and then they process the money and all that kind of stuff.
[03:08:43.637 --> 03:08:44.557]  That's a real function.
[03:08:45.077 --> 03:08:50.179]  But then the Federal Reserve Board of New York is another corporation in the Federal Reserve Act.
[03:08:50.559 --> 03:08:51.840]  It's privately owned, 80% foreign owned,
[03:08:53.360 --> 03:08:53.640]  Private.
[03:08:53.660 --> 03:08:53.821]  Private.
[03:08:53.861 --> 03:08:54.001]  Private.
[03:08:54.021 --> 03:08:54.901]  And how many people are part of it?
[03:08:54.921 --> 03:08:55.262]  How many people?
[03:08:55.282 --> 03:08:55.362]  Wow.
[03:09:13.556 --> 03:09:16.657]  All of our finances are controlled by these 10.
[03:09:17.378 --> 03:09:18.378]  Alex Jones joins us.
[03:09:18.938 --> 03:09:20.499]  He's a very controversial figure.
[03:09:21.139 --> 03:09:22.620]  I've spent time with him in Austin.
[03:09:22.760 --> 03:09:25.901]  We went to a few museums and had a nice steak dinner.
[03:09:25.981 --> 03:09:28.082]  And anyway, loves his kid.
[03:09:28.582 --> 03:09:29.142]  Loves his kids.
[03:09:29.182 --> 03:09:30.122]  Talks about his kids.
[03:09:30.202 --> 03:09:30.883]  Family man.
[03:09:31.603 --> 03:09:32.423]  Does amp up.
[03:09:32.463 --> 03:09:33.944]  This is somewhat of what
[03:09:35.162 --> 03:09:37.803]  I don't know what you would get if you hung out with Alex, but it's an amped-up version.
[03:09:37.823 --> 03:09:39.283]  This is an amped-up version of me.
[03:09:39.724 --> 03:09:41.804]  I mean, I'm aware that there's a mic in front of my face.
[03:09:42.325 --> 03:09:50.928]  And then as his marriage started to fall apart, and he can correct me here, it was a very... I haven't been through a divorce, but I've been through horrible breakups.
[03:09:50.948 --> 03:09:52.088]  It was a very tough time.
[03:09:52.528 --> 03:09:57.490]  And Alex, are you allowed to talk about any of this, or would you like to not talk about it?
[03:09:58.052 --> 03:09:59.553]  Oh, I can talk about it.
[03:10:00.193 --> 03:10:17.385]  I don't want to betray anything that was set off the record, but were you amazed at your wife, I mean, breaking ranks with you, and I don't know how to say it, but talking with the enemy, like, so gleefully cheering for your demise and really trying to hurt you?
[03:10:18.105 --> 03:10:19.807]  I mean, this was a woman you loved, you had children with.
[03:10:19.847 --> 03:10:21.728]  Was this a shocking development to you?
[03:10:21.748 --> 03:10:23.490]  I mean, were you amazed at how low it went?
[03:10:24.050 --> 03:10:29.715]  Well, I think of the annals of nasty divorces, it's a record breaker, and it's all on record.
[03:10:30.095 --> 03:10:32.196]  I didn't say anything bad about her, and I'm not going to say anything bad about her.
[03:10:32.737 --> 03:10:39.062]  But there was basically no bottom to the things that were said and done, and none of it was true.
[03:10:39.122 --> 03:10:39.803]  Why, Alex?
[03:10:40.283 --> 03:10:41.364]  Why the vitriol from her?
[03:10:42.925 --> 03:10:43.886]  You know, she...
[03:10:44.654 --> 03:10:51.496]  She filed for divorce on me and, you know, she had a boyfriend and that was just basically it.
[03:10:51.536 --> 03:10:55.497]  And then she tried to get me back like six months into it and I said no.
[03:10:55.977 --> 03:10:57.998]  And that's when, you know, she was the scorn of a woman.
[03:10:58.018 --> 03:11:03.819]  You know, like Shakespeare talked about, the Bible talks about it, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
[03:11:04.400 --> 03:11:09.261]  And, you know, she begged me to get back with her and I had a girlfriend by then and was quite frankly happy to be moved out of the house.
[03:11:10.295 --> 03:11:14.398]  Uh, and you know, right around that time then there was some issues and I got full custody of the kids.
[03:11:14.438 --> 03:11:15.259]  I don't want to get into it.
[03:11:16.079 --> 03:11:23.504]  But let's just say I pray for her and it seems like she kind of had a breakdown and I just want her to get better and just be happy.
[03:11:24.005 --> 03:11:29.749]  And she's cooled off from about an 11 at spinal tap level.
[03:11:30.509 --> 03:11:36.675]  She's cooled off from about an 11 to about a 3 right now, which most people would call that 3, just volcanically hateful and angry.
[03:11:37.796 --> 03:11:42.640]  But actually, you know, she's actually a wonderful person compared to the way she was now.
[03:11:43.061 --> 03:11:45.023]  You talk about gods and demons.
[03:11:45.043 --> 03:11:47.005]  Do you believe that that's what we're fighting against here?
[03:11:47.145 --> 03:11:49.527]  I mean, do you believe that we're having a battle on Earth right now?
[03:11:49.547 --> 03:11:52.430]  Do you really believe that it's clear-cut, that it's good versus evil?
[03:11:53.148 --> 03:11:53.728]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[03:11:53.768 --> 03:11:58.552]  I've always been a Christian, and I believe in God, and I've had spiritual experiences in life.
[03:11:58.592 --> 03:12:02.535]  But I, you know, I'm a worldly guy, and I kind of got away from God for a while.
[03:12:02.976 --> 03:12:03.776]  Where are you now?
[03:12:04.217 --> 03:12:10.261]  Well, in the last six, seven years, when I got really close to God, I started talking about Jesus Christ on air and things like that.
[03:12:10.341 --> 03:12:12.123]  That's when all hell broke loose.
[03:12:12.763 --> 03:12:16.024]  And you'll find out when you really start telling people it's a fight between good and evil at the end of the day.
[03:12:16.044 --> 03:12:19.825]  You know, just worry about your kid's spiritual future, not so much their grades.
[03:12:20.305 --> 03:12:21.605]  And I'm not saying that's not important.
[03:12:21.945 --> 03:12:26.306]  Worry about your own spiritual future and know that there really are all these dimensions we can't see.
[03:12:26.906 --> 03:12:29.627]  It's been proven, all these mathematicians that were atheists now say no.
[03:12:30.067 --> 03:12:34.008]  We believe that some other system has created an artificial dimension.
[03:12:34.028 --> 03:12:40.889]  They've got all these devices and spectrometers and things that can measure that there's a more powerful outside force
[03:12:41.844 --> 03:12:47.626]  Holding this universe together, and there are lower dimensions and higher dimensions, and there's free will in the universe.
[03:12:47.666 --> 03:12:52.348]  There's a lot of entities, a lot of creatures, a lot of things that we can't even see.
[03:12:53.069 --> 03:12:57.390]  We only see a limited part of the visual light spectrum.
[03:12:57.811 --> 03:13:02.953]  And they've proven that there's just all sorts of stuff that we can't even understand, energetically going on.
[03:13:03.453 --> 03:13:08.195]  And at the end of the day, when I talk about how there are, from my own research and what the globalists believe,
[03:13:08.815 --> 03:13:13.380]  The Globalists believe that they're contacting basically inter-dimensional aliens.
[03:13:14.020 --> 03:13:16.923]  That's what we call demons, and that they're giving them advanced knowledge.
[03:13:17.384 --> 03:13:19.746]  That's what all the ancients said when they would do black magic and things.
[03:13:19.766 --> 03:13:26.353]  They were getting, you know, Aleister Crowley, he was in the pyramids, you know, conjuring demons and people that were with him, so they looked like little gray aliens.
[03:13:26.933 --> 03:13:28.315]  And it's just really, really crazy stuff.
[03:13:28.335 --> 03:13:31.398]  And then they're basically giving advanced technology
[03:13:32.139 --> 03:13:43.887]  Through the ether to the Silicon Valley people who take all these drugs and do all these rituals to then get what they call divine inspiration through the space-time interdimensional gate.
[03:13:44.267 --> 03:13:49.131]  And then these demons are basically giving us technology and systems that we then build that will end up destroying us.
[03:13:51.083 --> 03:13:56.267]  Can the good side, can the godly folks, tap into that same power through angels?
[03:13:56.748 --> 03:13:58.449]  Absolutely, and that's what they don't want us to do.
[03:13:59.090 --> 03:14:01.052]  And listen, I didn't used to believe this.
[03:14:01.472 --> 03:14:05.456]  Then when I started studying deeply what the globalists are into, from their own internal documents,
[03:14:06.241 --> 03:14:07.443]  That's when they got really pissed.
[03:14:07.583 --> 03:14:15.292]  When I went on Joe Rogan's show for two hours a couple years ago and talked about this, and it was his most downloaded podcast, all sorts of hell broke loose over that.
[03:14:15.752 --> 03:14:18.095]  Elon Musk went on and basically said, I was right about everything.
[03:14:18.115 --> 03:14:23.081]  And then when he goes to these big billionaire conferences, they are literally doing rituals.
[03:14:23.542 --> 03:14:26.085]  They believe being contacted what they call the clockwork elves.
[03:14:26.685 --> 03:14:36.553]  And everybody that basically takes the DMT that your body releases during death and also the deepest sleep, it opens up a dimensional gate and people are there.
[03:14:36.873 --> 03:14:47.121]  So atheists are all becoming not atheists anymore because they're literally basically on spaceships in another dimension or on some type of craft with these guys.
[03:14:47.141 --> 03:14:48.662]  But sometimes you're strapped down on a table.
[03:14:49.022 --> 03:14:50.363]  Sometimes they torture the hell out of you.
[03:14:50.964 --> 03:14:53.406]  But that's what's happening when you take DMT and ayahuasca.
[03:14:54.366 --> 03:14:57.567]  Uh, is that it's opening up a dimension in your brain.
[03:14:57.607 --> 03:15:00.528]  Your brain's able to go to the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th dimension.
[03:15:00.988 --> 03:15:03.629]  And so you're opening up other dimensions, including lower dimensions.
[03:15:04.310 --> 03:15:05.590]  Uh, and some really bad stuff happens.
[03:15:05.750 --> 03:15:07.351]  I want to explain something.
[03:15:07.971 --> 03:15:08.171]  Yes.
[03:15:08.231 --> 03:15:09.992]  This is what the establishment believes.
[03:15:10.452 --> 03:15:14.573]  This is what the CIA was funding, uh, with the Unabomber and other people.
[03:15:15.273 --> 03:15:18.314]  Uh, and, and... Are you talking about MKUltra and things like this?
[03:15:19.615 --> 03:15:20.395]  Yes, all of it.
[03:15:21.295 --> 03:15:22.596]  We always think of contacting aliens.
[03:15:23.616 --> 03:15:23.756]  Alex.
[03:15:24.016 --> 03:15:24.196]  Alex.
[03:16:06.822 --> 03:16:08.764]  Let's go to Megan in Texas.
[03:16:08.824 --> 03:16:09.585]  Megan, you're on the air.
[03:16:09.605 --> 03:16:10.125]  Thanks for holding.
[03:16:10.165 --> 03:16:10.425]  Go ahead.
[03:16:10.606 --> 03:16:10.966]  Hi, Alex.
[03:16:10.986 --> 03:16:11.506]  How are you today?
[03:16:11.526 --> 03:16:12.047]  I'm awesome.
[03:16:12.067 --> 03:16:12.767]  Thank you for calling.
[03:16:12.787 --> 03:16:14.629]  I'm going to give you a little bit of my background.
[03:16:14.649 --> 03:16:16.210]  I was born and raised in California.
[03:16:16.330 --> 03:16:18.392]  I lived through the downfall of California.
[03:16:18.532 --> 03:16:24.217]  My husband and I got out of there as soon as we graduated from school, came to Texas, because to us it was a passion of freedom.
[03:16:24.397 --> 03:16:29.060]  And I'm looking at what's happening to Trump right now, and I'm telling you right now, this whole country's going the way of California.
[03:16:29.080 --> 03:16:30.301]  We're going to be disenfranchised.
[03:16:30.381 --> 03:16:32.483]  If they get him out, that's a gateway right there.
[03:16:32.523 --> 03:16:34.624]  There's no more middle of the country anymore.
[03:16:34.644 --> 03:16:35.565]  We're not going to have a say.
[03:16:35.585 --> 03:16:38.166]  I mean, we're killing babies, and we're poisoning the ones we're not killing.
[03:16:38.207 --> 03:16:45.191]  We're just here in Texas trying to raise our three little girls, and I just—what do you think we're going to—if they manage to get him out, what's our contingency plan?
[03:16:45.211 --> 03:16:46.012]  Where do we go from there?
[03:16:46.192 --> 03:16:49.955]  Megan, I hear the earnestness in your voice, the concern, and I absolutely agree with you.
[03:16:50.276 --> 03:16:52.758]  They hit Europe with 15 million military-age men.
[03:16:52.858 --> 03:16:53.518]  It's collapsed.
[03:16:53.638 --> 03:16:54.499]  They broke their borders.
[03:16:54.539 --> 03:16:55.480]  They're breaking ours.
[03:16:55.700 --> 03:16:56.381]  It's treason.
[03:16:56.501 --> 03:17:00.364]  The governor of New Mexico, the governor of California has pulled National Guard off.
[03:17:00.524 --> 03:17:02.766]  We have tens of thousands, four caravans coming.
[03:17:02.966 --> 03:17:06.209]  Five million have announced they're coming in a major gallop pull.
[03:17:06.389 --> 03:17:07.951]  This is insane.
[03:17:08.111 --> 03:17:12.034]  I mean, it is on, and again, they're using these people as weapons.
[03:17:12.074 --> 03:17:12.995]  They're saying, you know,
[03:17:13.175 --> 03:17:18.797]  No, no deal on government shutdown unless you get rid of the 100,000 beds and only make it 16,500.
[03:17:19.037 --> 03:17:21.878]  They're literally saying you can't hold rapists and murderers.
[03:17:22.258 --> 03:17:25.579]  They're saying you can't check who the kids are with or what diseases they have.
[03:17:25.959 --> 03:17:31.301]  This is the lawless world government breaking of America with the Democrat collaborators running it all.
[03:17:31.561 --> 03:17:32.502]  You're absolutely right.
[03:17:32.542 --> 03:17:47.034]  Yeah, um, I just, I feel like, not only that, my husband and I are both business owners, and I hate to say this, but the brain-dead masses, you try to get through to these people, they're so asleep and zombified, and I just want to say, the people who don't live in border states, they have no clue.
[03:17:47.054 --> 03:17:50.817]  They have no clue what's gonna happen when all these people come in and overrun us.
[03:17:50.897 --> 03:17:51.758]  I've seen it happen.
[03:17:51.818 --> 03:17:55.041]  You can go to the downtown area I grew up in, and it's nothing but Spanish.
[03:17:55.101 --> 03:17:57.182]  You go to the Walmart, everything's in Spanish.
[03:17:57.202 --> 03:17:58.984]  If you didn't know Spanish, you didn't get a job.
[03:17:59.124 --> 03:18:02.348]  This is the globalist plan, and it's absolutely two minutes to midnight.
[03:18:02.388 --> 03:18:04.450]  California used to be just like Texas.
[03:18:04.530 --> 03:18:06.232]  It's now a collapsing hellhole.
[03:18:06.292 --> 03:18:07.093]  God bless you, Megan.
[03:18:08.254 --> 03:18:11.538]  Megan was on fire, ladies and gentlemen, and her warning is absolutely true.
[03:18:11.558 --> 03:18:12.299]  Are you going to listen to her?
[03:18:13.400 --> 03:18:17.225]  Because a lot of Texans, a lot of Oklahomans went out to California.
[03:18:18.653 --> 03:18:22.879]  And now they've come back because the state is gone, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:18:23.100 --> 03:18:26.845]  We have some affiliates out there, a lot of great people, a beautiful state, but it's gone.
[03:18:26.885 --> 03:18:30.090]  We have to admit, this is the mindset, this is the program into the future.
[03:18:36.255 --> 03:18:39.777]  Andy wants to talk about being involved in the fight for the 2nd A. Yeah, that's the big one.
[03:18:40.477 --> 03:18:41.418]  They're coming at the guns.
[03:18:41.478 --> 03:18:43.879]  The Democrats say they have the votes in the House to ban semi-autos.
[03:18:43.899 --> 03:18:45.400]  They're going to try to pass it.
[03:18:45.760 --> 03:18:48.582]  Notice they've gone from denying they want to ban the 2nd Amendment to admitting it.
[03:18:49.342 --> 03:18:49.563]  Andy?
[03:18:49.803 --> 03:18:50.843]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[03:18:50.903 --> 03:18:52.624]  I've got to say, Alex, I'm a big fan of the show.
[03:18:52.644 --> 03:18:53.805]  I'm a big fan of both of my daughters.
[03:18:54.185 --> 03:19:00.471]  I need to take some of that because I'm a little bit run down with allergies today and I'm always like, wait, my own products are great.
[03:19:00.551 --> 03:19:03.034]  I think I should take some Brain Force Plus and some Secret 12.
[03:19:15.265 --> 03:19:15.605]  You're right.
[03:19:15.645 --> 03:19:16.145]  There you go.
[03:19:16.225 --> 03:19:22.807]  Well, hey, in my home state of Connecticut here, we're facing some very tough economic times, which is causing taxes to go up.
[03:19:22.847 --> 03:19:25.188]  There's businesses and people leaving the state in droves.
[03:19:25.388 --> 03:19:32.650]  One of the taxes they're introducing, or want to, hopefully this won't pass, is they want a 50% tax on your ammunition, no matter what it is.
[03:19:32.730 --> 03:19:35.050]  They also forced, I mean, they forced Remington out of business.
[03:19:35.070 --> 03:19:38.111]  The same law firm suing me sued Remington out of business.
[03:19:38.291 --> 03:19:42.820]  Yeah, another law they're trying to pass is to ban all semi-automatic weapons in my state.
[03:19:42.860 --> 03:19:45.345]  Which means anything, well you know what a semi-automatic is.
[03:19:45.385 --> 03:19:46.487]  Anything semi-automatic?
[03:19:46.708 --> 03:19:47.549]  Yeah, anything.
[03:19:47.810 --> 03:19:50.255]  Anything you pull the trigger it shoots a bullet.
[03:20:06.233 --> 03:20:08.832]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:31.089 --> 03:20:36.279]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[03:20:37.120 --> 03:20:38.002]  Move bitch!
[03:20:38.182 --> 03:20:39.385]  Get out the way!
[03:20:41.176 --> 03:20:47.242]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[03:20:47.362 --> 03:20:52.366]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[03:20:52.486 --> 03:20:55.529]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[03:20:55.649 --> 03:20:57.050]  I will not let you down.
[03:20:57.090 --> 03:20:59.713]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:20:59.893 --> 03:21:01.354]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[03:21:01.494 --> 03:21:04.337]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[03:21:04.397 --> 03:21:09.061]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[03:21:09.242 --> 03:21:11.284]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:21:11.824 --> 03:21:12.885]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:21:14.527 --> 03:21:16.909]  I did an ayahuasca ceremony last year.
[03:21:16.929 --> 03:21:17.690]  I did several of them.
[03:21:17.950 --> 03:21:18.331]  And what happened?
[03:21:18.351 --> 03:21:19.231]  Did you see your spirit animal?
[03:21:20.152 --> 03:21:22.154]  Uh, you know, I think I did.
[03:21:22.515 --> 03:21:24.396]  And they, you know, all kinds of things.
[03:21:24.717 --> 03:21:25.477]  I will tell you that
[03:21:26.482 --> 03:21:30.885]  Maybe 49 people, I think, and I was the one guy that didn't think it was God.
[03:21:31.806 --> 03:21:34.487]  I thought it was a chemical reaction to this vine.
[03:21:35.328 --> 03:21:38.070]  But everybody else had very profound... Now, I saw profound things.
[03:21:38.150 --> 03:21:41.752]  I mean, I was at my father's deathbed, and I mean, I was there.
[03:21:43.133 --> 03:21:44.754]  In every sense of the... It was like a holodeck.
[03:21:45.295 --> 03:21:52.600]  You talk about Elon Musk and his thoughts of you, I'd like to know... You know, he says we're in a hologram right now, that we're living in a holographic universe.
[03:21:54.204 --> 03:21:57.265]  Like the holodeck on Star Trek, to make it stupid simple.
[03:21:58.225 --> 03:21:59.485]  Is that what you think we're in right now?
[03:22:00.946 --> 03:22:06.787]  This is a real third-dimensional flesh-and-blood simulation created by God.
[03:22:07.667 --> 03:22:10.328]  And so, let me break this down.
[03:22:11.628 --> 03:22:18.210]  We are basically composite creatures, where we have our consciousness and our soul.
[03:22:19.022 --> 03:22:20.303]  Okay, that is eternal.
[03:22:20.343 --> 03:22:35.759]  But then if you look at the body, this is a scientific fact, we are electrochemically and genetically connected to all of our ancestors, wherever they came from, going all the way back into the ends of creation and the start of everything, whatever that really was.
[03:22:36.620 --> 03:22:39.803]  And so we are a genetic composite of all of those people
[03:22:40.678 --> 03:22:40.898]  That's
[03:23:00.362 --> 03:23:08.326]  Like a coral reef or a system, a communal system, you know like jellyfish aren't one creature.
[03:23:08.626 --> 03:23:10.868]  It's a whole bunch of cells in a colony.
[03:23:11.328 --> 03:23:14.970]  And so our bodies are genetic, time-traveling colonies.
[03:23:15.630 --> 03:23:16.431]  Do we go to heaven?
[03:23:16.471 --> 03:23:17.552]  Is there a soul?
[03:23:17.612 --> 03:23:19.753]  Yes, if you choose God, and God's at the top,
[03:23:42.149 --> 03:23:52.072]  Then you ascend through that, and it's basically like a light bridge, or it looks like a waterfall, and you have to basically swim up it in the space-time continuum.
[03:23:52.312 --> 03:23:57.273]  But you have to be loving, be good, be strong, be honorable, and not resonate with the dark.
[03:23:57.813 --> 03:24:02.875]  If you resonate with the dark, then you start basically going back down.
[03:24:02.895 --> 03:24:05.936]  I mean, I would use the analogy of first man, which is a true story.
[03:24:08.044 --> 03:24:08.244]  We're
[03:24:20.646 --> 03:24:24.990]  Or he was about to keep bouncing on the atmosphere and then go back down to Earth.
[03:24:25.490 --> 03:24:34.397]  But instead of, if you use a spiritual allegory, Neil Armstrong would have gone to heaven if he kept going into space, and would have gone to hell if he went back down to Earth.
[03:24:34.757 --> 03:24:40.502]  But at the third dimensional level, he would have died if he kept going into space, and he lived by getting back in the atmosphere and going back down to Earth.
[03:24:40.542 --> 03:24:43.064]  So it's basically like that, and we're in a purgatory.
[03:24:43.844 --> 03:24:44.725]  We're good to go.
[03:24:58.852 --> 03:25:01.235]  Alex, look, we've all heard, and I think it's dangerous
[03:25:15.814 --> 03:25:16.755]  And I don't want to know what you think.
[03:25:16.775 --> 03:25:19.077]  And again, Alex and I don't agree on everything.
[03:25:19.137 --> 03:25:20.058]  I'm letting the man talk.
[03:25:20.898 --> 03:25:24.601]  And I have different theories as well, but I'm not here to talk to me.
[03:25:24.621 --> 03:25:25.862]  I want to hear what Alex has to say.
[03:25:25.902 --> 03:25:28.985]  But, you know, people that say, you know, we're God.
[03:25:29.305 --> 03:25:29.945]  We're God.
[03:25:30.954 --> 03:25:32.275]  And that always creeps me out.
[03:25:32.775 --> 03:25:35.476]  And I hear it more and more from people, this idea that we're God.
[03:25:35.496 --> 03:25:37.397]  I don't think I'm God, Alex.
[03:25:37.437 --> 03:25:38.858]  I think I'm creation.
[03:25:39.058 --> 03:25:42.060]  It's like the Frankenstein monster is in Frankenstein.
[03:25:43.301 --> 03:25:44.161]  Are you God, Alex?
[03:25:45.101 --> 03:25:45.322]  No.
[03:25:45.342 --> 03:25:46.602]  See, you're strong-minded.
[03:25:46.622 --> 03:25:47.403]  You're a Christian.
[03:25:47.883 --> 03:25:50.925]  So you went and saw your father because he meant so much to you.
[03:25:50.945 --> 03:25:53.426]  You, in that space-time continuum, expanding.
[03:25:55.046 --> 03:26:02.328]  Your perception, not your consciousness, but expanding your conscious awareness of just how large the universe really is.
[03:26:02.768 --> 03:26:05.248]  You spent that time to go back and see your father.
[03:26:05.308 --> 03:26:08.169]  You spent that time to try to reflect on your family.
[03:26:08.709 --> 03:26:15.110]  Other people see the matrix system around them and they get on a power trip and they say, this is God.
[03:26:15.790 --> 03:26:16.350]  I'm God.
[03:26:16.750 --> 03:26:19.831]  Once they now realize there really is a God, that's what I'm saying, they go from being
[03:26:21.011 --> 03:26:29.757]  Oh, I'm a god, the shaman's here with me, and now this group that's inducted me into this, and then that's how you get into the real occult.
[03:26:30.318 --> 03:26:45.468]  And then all of that ends up leading into black magic and satanism, and that's why they use these shaman and people who mean well, at many levels, to get people inducted into it, and then they basically get recruited into Aleister Crowley-type cults once you get back to the United States and Europe.
[03:26:46.088 --> 03:26:46.829]  We're good to go.
[03:26:56.903 --> 03:27:06.448]  Once you uncloak, and once you can see what's past the veil, now they can see you, and now you keep doing very bad things.
[03:27:06.968 --> 03:27:15.833]  Start coming up through the lower dimensions, swimming up like sharks to eat somebody floating on the surface in a tube or something.
[03:27:17.533 --> 03:27:24.277]  If they think they can trick you, and you're already basically predisposed to think you're God, they'll then present themselves
[03:27:25.322 --> 03:27:31.827]  Generally, like an elf, or a beautiful woman, or maybe a tall Nordic, is how these demons like to present themselves.
[03:27:32.167 --> 03:27:36.910]  And they'll tell you how you're God, and how all... Well, Alex, Alex, Alex!
[03:27:37.191 --> 03:27:42.374]  They appear at the edge, you know, when I did it, they appear at the edge of the jungle.
[03:27:42.454 --> 03:27:49.099]  Now, I didn't have this for me, but they appear at the edge of the jungle, and they welcome you in, and I actually have audio.
[03:27:49.139 --> 03:27:51.061]  This is the actual audio from my...
[03:27:53.721 --> 03:27:55.622]  Ayahuasca ceremony in Costa Rica.
[03:27:59.345 --> 03:28:07.852]  And I did see something outside of, I mean, I saw a guy that was just absolutely, uh, vibrating in and out of something very frightening.
[03:28:08.912 --> 03:28:17.759]  And in fact, not only did I see it, everybody saw it and got away from this guy who was very dark, natured, and very scary.
[03:28:20.561 --> 03:28:21.082]  And, uh,
[03:28:22.142 --> 03:28:23.924]  There were people that saw things that were so horrific.
[03:28:24.104 --> 03:28:35.478]  I, again, and again, I think it was a chemical reaction in the brain, but, and I don't know that I put anything spiritual to it, but I did, I did, I mean, the sights, the sounds, the smells, everything.
[03:28:35.558 --> 03:28:39.623]  I was, I was back in time at my father's deathbed of cancer.
[03:28:40.552 --> 03:28:47.775]  Alex, over the years I've had people contact me, and I have an incredible nose for BS.
[03:28:48.395 --> 03:28:50.016]  I think I can tell when someone's BSing me.
[03:28:50.596 --> 03:28:53.337]  I can tell immediately when someone calls my radio show and they're gonna mess with me.
[03:28:53.817 --> 03:28:54.377]  I can feel it.
[03:28:54.617 --> 03:28:55.257]  I can sense it.
[03:28:55.438 --> 03:29:00.259]  Spidey sense.
[03:29:04.061 --> 03:29:07.102]  They say I'm too Goku for Roku, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:29:08.682 --> 03:29:08.782]  Ah!
[03:29:09.042 --> 03:29:09.503]  Yay!
[03:29:09.603 --> 03:29:10.903]  Take Alex Jones off!
[03:29:11.024 --> 03:29:11.844]  He's evil!
[03:29:11.984 --> 03:29:12.504]  He's bad!
[03:29:12.544 --> 03:29:14.385]  He's sending people to be mean to children!
[03:29:14.546 --> 03:29:17.807]  And then the lawyers used my voice to say things I haven't ever said.
[03:29:17.988 --> 03:29:21.490]  A new fan app that we authorized, this new one, started shooting to the top.
[03:29:21.530 --> 03:29:23.811]  And so it was on the front page because it was most popular.
[03:29:24.011 --> 03:29:26.412]  And so it was red alert.
[03:29:26.492 --> 03:29:31.833]  But now they've turned me into Godzilla, Mothra, King Kong, all at once.
[03:29:32.093 --> 03:29:33.314]  And I've got to be destroyed.
[03:29:33.434 --> 03:29:36.535]  They're in the Washington Post and New York Times, how they blueprinted it.
[03:29:36.595 --> 03:29:40.776]  But then they sent in the Sandy Hook lawyers to say I was coming after the families right now.
[03:29:40.796 --> 03:29:41.956]  You've got to get him off us.
[03:29:41.976 --> 03:29:42.816]  The wolf's at the door.
[03:29:42.836 --> 03:29:43.797]  Call the SWAT team.
[03:29:43.857 --> 03:29:44.737]  God, Jones, stop it!
[03:29:44.777 --> 03:29:45.037]  No!
[03:29:45.097 --> 03:29:45.537]  He's here!
[03:29:45.557 --> 03:29:45.937]  Good Lord!
[03:29:45.977 --> 03:29:46.257]  Ah!
[03:29:46.277 --> 03:29:46.358]  Ah!
[03:29:46.398 --> 03:29:47.998]  Imperial troops have entered the base!
[03:29:48.338 --> 03:29:50.559]  And they're like, we're going to take them down?
[03:29:50.599 --> 03:29:50.799]  Hell!
[03:29:51.764 --> 03:29:53.505]  None of it was true, but hey, so what?
[03:29:53.826 --> 03:29:54.626]  I'm convinced.
[03:29:54.666 --> 03:29:56.247]  We had lots of downloads on the app.
[03:29:56.287 --> 03:29:57.428]  The guy who made it talked to me.
[03:29:57.468 --> 03:29:59.750]  He said there were thousands of downloads on day one.
[03:29:59.770 --> 03:30:01.912]  It was extremely successful with no marketing.
[03:30:02.412 --> 03:30:05.534]  But I'm convinced that the left stalks you, Alex.
[03:30:05.594 --> 03:30:06.815]  I think they've been watching you.
[03:30:06.835 --> 03:30:08.216]  They have a Google Alert set up.
[03:30:08.276 --> 03:30:19.524]  They found out about this app and they called in all of their allies because it was every single outlet from the Daily Beast to the Huffington Post to the New York Times to the Washington Post all within a couple hours.
[03:30:20.445 --> 03:30:28.031]  Before anybody on the right even knew about this app, we had the left rioting in the streets practically saying that Alex Jones needs to be pulled off Roku.
[03:30:28.051 --> 03:30:32.935]  So, I think the real interesting thing here is they played their card a little too strong.
[03:30:32.975 --> 03:30:34.096]  They showed their hand, I think.
[03:30:34.356 --> 03:30:36.878]  We now know that this is all about censoring you.
[03:30:36.938 --> 03:30:39.340]  It's all about economically strangling InfoWars.
[03:30:39.640 --> 03:30:41.301]  There's no grassroots movement.
[03:30:41.541 --> 03:30:45.324]  There's no people that are concerned you're profiting off the lives of dead children.
[03:30:45.444 --> 03:30:53.189]  That's all just a fictitious nonsense that the leftist media created so they could have an excuse to go after you, which is, I think, what this is all about.
[03:30:53.289 --> 03:31:00.094]  And then the other thing is conservatives have got to get angry because Roku first said, we believe in the First Amendment.
[03:31:00.114 --> 03:31:02.015]  We believe Alex Jones has a right to speak.
[03:31:02.075 --> 03:31:04.157]  We're not going to get into the business of
[03:31:04.797 --> 03:31:06.037]  Violating the First Amendment.
[03:31:06.077 --> 03:31:08.218]  That was Roku's original statement.
[03:31:08.238 --> 03:31:12.799]  They actually put that out on Twitter and later deleted it after the leftist mob came to attack them.
[03:31:12.859 --> 03:31:15.920]  And you see, when we defend ourselves, when we say, well you know what?
[03:31:16.420 --> 03:31:17.960]  I'm not going to buy Roku.
[03:31:18.140 --> 03:31:19.581]  I'm not going to use Roku.
[03:31:19.721 --> 03:31:20.441]  It's gone.
[03:31:21.001 --> 03:31:23.302]  Because of that, that makes a big difference.
[03:31:23.442 --> 03:31:24.902]  So if you're a radio listener, I have a
[03:31:26.331 --> 03:31:32.213]  Hammer in my hand, a small sledgehammer, and I am going to smash the Roku commie stick.
[03:31:32.294 --> 03:31:34.975]  So, bye-bye to Roku, hello to Cloud.
[03:31:34.995 --> 03:31:37.176]  Tough little bugger.
[03:31:37.296 --> 03:31:38.876]  Close shot, please, for the money shot.
[03:31:38.916 --> 03:31:44.719]  Son of a... Come here, I'll get you now.
[03:31:44.999 --> 03:31:46.259]  Roku, you will pay!
[03:31:47.740 --> 03:31:49.461]  I tell you, it's harder than a jar of pickles.
[03:31:49.741 --> 03:31:50.821]  Say bye-bye.
[03:31:52.422 --> 03:31:53.162]  That was a better idea.
[03:31:53.182 --> 03:31:53.622]  That got it.
[03:31:53.662 --> 03:31:54.783]  Okay, now it's been destroyed.
[03:31:56.120 --> 03:31:58.581]  And that's just a primitive chimpanzee behavior, but it was fun to do.
[03:32:02.903 --> 03:32:04.544]  I cannot believe we even produced this.
[03:32:04.664 --> 03:32:07.625]  I mean, this is insane.
[03:32:07.925 --> 03:32:10.046]  I said, I'm a game changer.
[03:32:11.126 --> 03:32:11.927]  I'm a guru.
[03:32:13.127 --> 03:32:13.988]  I'm a scientist.
[03:32:15.128 --> 03:32:16.569]  I'm an activist.
[03:32:16.729 --> 03:32:18.830]  And other people aren't willing to do it.
[03:32:18.970 --> 03:32:22.411]  And I'll tell you right now, I'm here to ram heads with you.
[03:32:23.471 --> 03:32:24.552]  Synergy drinks are bad.
[03:32:34.923 --> 03:32:36.164]  Now, did you hear what I just said?
[03:32:36.184 --> 03:32:56.362]  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[03:33:06.135 --> 03:33:10.237]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.461 --> 03:33:22.602]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[03:33:22.722 --> 03:33:27.004]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:33:27.764 --> 03:33:29.565]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:39.360 --> 03:33:44.766]  You and I both have interviewed a fascinating man named David Icke, and you know where I'm going with this.
[03:33:45.206 --> 03:33:57.800]  And as I was doing this ayahuasca, which is a vine, and I saw this guy vibrating in and out of a human form, I was reminded of David Icke, and people that have contacted me over the years, and many of them terrified.
[03:33:58.420 --> 03:33:59.401]  In fact, one of the biggest
[03:34:00.302 --> 03:34:09.310]  Ministers on earth I talked to about this and he said you know I thought this stuff was crazy until I was in prison talking to a guy and I saw I Saw his face shift.
[03:34:09.350 --> 03:34:10.891]  I saw a change and again.
[03:34:10.931 --> 03:34:16.136]  I've had many people I I got offered serious money to write a book about this.
[03:34:16.436 --> 03:34:19.058]  I did years of research on this and in fact
[03:34:20.319 --> 03:34:23.762]  A major company even optioned it to possibly make a movie out of it.
[03:34:24.222 --> 03:34:26.744]  And the more I got into it, it was so dark.
[03:34:27.384 --> 03:34:30.346]  And I thought so dangerous that I didn't want to go any deeper.
[03:34:31.027 --> 03:34:33.128]  And you've been ridiculed a lot for talking about these things.
[03:34:33.709 --> 03:34:38.452]  And so I don't put anyone on my show to make them look bad.
[03:34:38.932 --> 03:34:40.413]  But you have been outspoken about it.
[03:34:41.054 --> 03:34:42.655]  Are we talking about shapeshifters here?
[03:34:43.407 --> 03:34:48.951]  Well, Mancow, listen to me very carefully, because this is very dangerous what we're talking about, and people listening need to understand this is not a game.
[03:34:49.592 --> 03:34:53.335]  It's not a chemical reaction, Mancow, when you all see the same thing.
[03:34:53.355 --> 03:34:58.839]  The drug opens up the gateway in the brain to other dimensions, and I told you
[03:34:59.813 --> 03:35:02.276]  Really serious, evil, demonic stuff can swim up.
[03:35:02.396 --> 03:35:07.401]  A lot of people go to these rituals who are already heavily into it to actually suck energy off everybody else.
[03:35:07.862 --> 03:35:08.502]  Yeah.
[03:35:08.602 --> 03:35:12.747]  And I think this guy I saw changing, I think he was demonic for real.
[03:35:13.267 --> 03:35:18.973]  And listen, Billy Corgan has been very open about it, seeing a woman shift.
[03:35:19.714 --> 03:35:22.997]  Uh, saw her eyes go completely black, and I, and that's, is that a different thing?
[03:35:23.017 --> 03:35:25.398]  People, their eyes go... No, it's not a different thing.
[03:35:25.438 --> 03:35:26.379]  Completely black.
[03:35:26.399 --> 03:35:27.540]  Let me, let me hear what's happening.
[03:35:27.580 --> 03:35:37.587]  Let me just, I want to tell people quickly that over the years, and I'm going back to the mid-1980s, I've had people call, and they were, I'm talking to my girlfriend, I'm at wherever, and their eyes went completely black.
[03:35:37.947 --> 03:35:38.568]  What's happening?
[03:35:39.878 --> 03:35:40.719]  I want to explain something.
[03:35:41.159 --> 03:35:43.341]  You say, oh, you're being controversial or I'm being controversial.
[03:35:43.361 --> 03:35:50.206]  We're telling people what Hollywood and what the billionaires and the tech people are obsessed with.
[03:35:50.326 --> 03:35:51.807]  This is all they do.
[03:35:52.267 --> 03:35:54.309]  They're on drugs multiple days of the week.
[03:35:54.389 --> 03:35:55.269]  It's mainstream news.
[03:35:55.570 --> 03:35:57.391]  They're not just microdosing LSD.
[03:35:57.691 --> 03:36:02.315]  They've got a bunch of other synthetic stuff way beyond ayahuasca, way beyond DMT.
[03:36:03.095 --> 03:36:03.876]  And I'm telling you,
[03:36:04.747 --> 03:36:07.668]  I'm telling you, it's like a trip to the universe.
[03:36:07.708 --> 03:36:13.891]  Some people want to contact entities that basically operate like aliens and give them advanced blueprints for technology.
[03:36:14.171 --> 03:36:18.433]  That's what San Francisco is, a research base contacting aliens for U.S.
[03:36:18.473 --> 03:36:19.594]  advanced weapons research.
[03:36:19.614 --> 03:36:20.614]  That's what they believe they're doing.
[03:36:21.234 --> 03:36:28.678]  I was told about this when I was a kid because I had some family that had friends that were in advanced research projects with DARPA out in San Francisco.
[03:36:28.738 --> 03:36:31.559]  I heard this at the dinner table when I was like eight years old, okay?
[03:36:31.879 --> 03:36:33.260]  Okay, Alex, Alex?
[03:36:34.549 --> 03:36:47.898]  I was in San Francisco, I broadcast at the Norman Wood Show for years, and I also heard these stories that they talk to very creepy greys, is what military people have told me, and they don't know if they're good or bad.
[03:36:49.039 --> 03:36:50.760]  The feeling that many get is they're sinister.
[03:36:50.780 --> 03:36:55.523]  Yes, yes, yes, the Presidio and the whole area is the contact zone.
[03:36:56.284 --> 03:36:59.466]  Now listen, people, you have to understand something, this is not my opinion.
[03:37:00.086 --> 03:37:02.388]  This is what San Francisco elite believe.
[03:37:03.112 --> 03:37:04.492]  So you can say it's a chemical reaction.
[03:37:04.532 --> 03:37:19.757]  Okay, what is it in our brain that a bunch of people get together in a city and take a bunch of advanced drugs to be in contact with aliens, and they do it enough that then people that do this enough can actually start shifting themselves because it's taking over this dimension.
[03:37:20.217 --> 03:37:20.897]  And that's what this is.
[03:37:20.937 --> 03:37:24.879]  This is an alien invasion through the computers, through the smartphones, through everything.
[03:37:24.919 --> 03:37:25.739]  That's the big secret.
[03:37:26.079 --> 03:37:28.720]  And as soon as I started talking about that, that's when they took me off here.
[03:37:28.780 --> 03:37:32.601]  They're like, uh-uh, we can't, they'll never, they didn't actually, they never attacked me for this.
[03:37:33.729 --> 03:37:35.109]  They do not touch this, my friend.
[03:37:35.950 --> 03:37:37.550]  Because that's the big truth.
[03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:38.510]  They didn't come from space.
[03:37:39.390 --> 03:37:42.071]  They came through a dimensional gate in our brains.
[03:37:43.351 --> 03:37:44.011]  Of course they would.
[03:37:44.612 --> 03:37:50.833]  And so now, the big hot thing with Joe Rogan and all these self-help groups, and I'm not even saying Joe's a bad guy, but he promotes it.
[03:37:51.373 --> 03:37:53.494]  That's just like the LSD in Timothy Leary.
[03:37:53.734 --> 03:37:54.834]  He admits working for the CIA.
[03:37:57.037 --> 03:38:01.098]  In the 60s and 70s, to promote that to young people in the psychedelic revolution.
[03:38:01.478 --> 03:38:10.920]  Now they're going into the next phase, getting everybody to go to these big retreats, and the police turn a blind eye, even in places like Texas where it's illegal, and everybody takes ayahuasca.
[03:38:11.540 --> 03:38:18.762]  And then, ooh, there's always somebody there that runs into something dark, and, oh, there's some light over here, and people are then tricked into the whole deal.
[03:38:20.465 --> 03:38:21.266]  And that's what goes on.
[03:38:21.486 --> 03:38:25.208]  It's all energetic, interdimensional.
[03:38:25.248 --> 03:38:28.450]  I went to a place, you can look it up, I went to a place called Rhythmia.
[03:38:28.610 --> 03:38:32.132]  I had a doctor and nurses to keep an eye on me.
[03:38:32.192 --> 03:38:34.113]  I wouldn't do this stuff in somebody's apartment.
[03:38:34.793 --> 03:38:36.834]  I've been offered to do that as well.
[03:38:37.054 --> 03:38:38.135]  It's a very hip thing right now.
[03:38:38.315 --> 03:38:38.856]  I tried it.
[03:38:39.496 --> 03:38:40.236]  I don't recommend it.
[03:38:41.357 --> 03:38:42.177]  I didn't need to do it.
[03:38:42.738 --> 03:38:46.060]  All that happened to me was I had very vivid
[03:38:47.185 --> 03:38:49.626]  Memories from my past.
[03:38:49.666 --> 03:38:51.507]  Some good, some were negative.
[03:38:51.547 --> 03:38:54.849]  Other people were so shaken that they were terrified.
[03:38:54.969 --> 03:38:56.129]  So I know what you're saying.
[03:38:56.149 --> 03:39:02.532]  That's because, man, you're an accomplished, smart guy with a strong family and a Christian, so you have a shield up around you.
[03:39:02.992 --> 03:39:08.635]  And I'm telling you, people that don't have God and who don't have that tie, that higher dimension, they're wide open.
[03:39:09.355 --> 03:39:13.477]  Alex, hang on because we're running out of time and I want to make sure I get to this.
[03:39:14.757 --> 03:39:23.280]  All this hydrogen collider and all of this, are they trying to break through other dimensions to unleash literally hell on earth right now?
[03:39:23.340 --> 03:39:24.401]  Is there an effort to do that?
[03:39:25.721 --> 03:39:27.822]  I know this.
[03:39:27.862 --> 03:39:33.144]  The scientists admit that they could create something called a Strangelet, which you basically see in a
[03:39:34.005 --> 03:39:41.412]  Science fiction Star Trek came out a few years ago where there's a mining ship and he injects the quote red matter in the middle of the planet and it makes it turn into a black hole.
[03:39:42.493 --> 03:39:47.998]  Okay yeah yeah science is trying to create a black hole into other dimensions is that is that what's going on right now?
[03:39:48.618 --> 03:39:57.647]  Well that's just what I'm telling you is what the Hadron scientists admit that they can create a black hole that you create a strange lid and they're trying to find new particles
[03:39:58.396 --> 03:40:10.861]  They're trying to find particles that they basically slam different radioactive protons and heavy metals into each other.
[03:40:11.957 --> 03:40:13.398]  This ceremony that the world had,
[03:40:37.279 --> 03:40:40.040]  It's some of the most bizarre footage I've ever seen in my entire life.
[03:40:40.400 --> 03:40:44.162]  If I wanted to direct people listening to us right now to see that, how is it labeled?
[03:40:44.202 --> 03:40:45.582]  How could someone find it on the internet?
[03:40:46.983 --> 03:40:48.123]  What ceremony is that?
[03:40:48.143 --> 03:40:57.947]  They dug this big hole and they had a big ceremony, and there's all kinds of people dressed as demons, and all the leaders from the world are there, and... Oh, I remember this.
[03:40:58.307 --> 03:41:00.047]  Oh, yeah.
[03:41:00.287 --> 03:41:00.868]  It should have been 2001.
[03:41:02.651 --> 03:41:03.671]  But it was in the year 2000.
[03:41:04.552 --> 03:41:05.512]  It was in the year 2000.
[03:41:06.172 --> 03:41:09.473]  And it was supposedly the last day of that millennium.
[03:41:09.893 --> 03:41:10.813]  New day of the next millennium.
[03:41:10.833 --> 03:41:11.933]  Even though it really wasn't.
[03:41:12.353 --> 03:41:16.314]  And PBS was going around the world.
[03:41:16.655 --> 03:41:18.415]  And they were at the Great Pyramid.
[03:41:18.575 --> 03:41:19.835]  They were also going to France.
[03:41:20.636 --> 03:41:22.096]  And I was just sitting there watching it.
[03:41:22.116 --> 03:41:23.216]  I recorded it on VHS.
[03:41:23.236 --> 03:41:24.216]  Back then it was VHS.
[03:41:24.797 --> 03:41:27.577]  And they were going, we love you, anti-beast.
[03:41:28.017 --> 03:41:30.378]  Come into our dimension, anti-beast.
[03:41:31.090 --> 03:41:37.739]  And then they were just cutting to like, you know, 200-foot demons and huge... No, no, this is great what you're talking about.
[03:41:37.799 --> 03:41:39.561]  No, what I'm talking about, I mean, that's fascinating.
[03:41:39.761 --> 03:41:45.989]  What I was talking about was they had, there was a giant hole, and they were having this big celebration, this giant hole they had built.
[03:41:46.834 --> 03:41:47.954]  It was like a couple of years ago.
[03:41:48.594 --> 03:41:53.395]  And some people say they captured at this party a sacrifice of someone being killed.
[03:41:53.736 --> 03:41:57.216]  You see people in robes, and it looks like they kill a woman.
[03:41:57.236 --> 03:42:00.457]  Let me tell you, they do a lot of this stuff right out in the open.
[03:42:00.477 --> 03:42:01.457]  That gives them more power, they think.
[03:42:01.477 --> 03:42:09.239]  But listen, I got invited by the widow of the biggest name in rock and roll.
[03:42:09.259 --> 03:42:10.599]  I mean, I think you can say the biggest.
[03:42:10.619 --> 03:42:12.240]  Everybody can probably guess who I'm talking about.
[03:42:14.250 --> 03:42:32.474]  They were trying to get me, and I'm not saying they're bad, I'm not saying they're good, but just in hindsight, they were really calling me, talking to me a lot, and trying to also the son of the feds who contacted me, and trying to get me on their private jet to go to this event in Reykjavik.
[03:42:33.178 --> 03:42:34.038]  Uh, to do a ritual.
[03:42:34.058 --> 03:42:35.939]  This is like six, seven years ago.
[03:42:36.480 --> 03:42:41.862]  To fire the real, like, Lucifer beam into space and try to bring in the real New Age and all this.
[03:42:41.882 --> 03:42:43.443]  And I said, you know, no thanks.
[03:42:43.543 --> 03:42:44.603]  I don't think I'll be doing that.
[03:42:49.985 --> 03:42:54.127]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:42:54.888 --> 03:42:56.348]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:42:56.969 --> 03:42:58.149]  It's two-way heroin.
[03:42:58.189 --> 03:42:59.390]  Fear is gone.
[03:43:02.748 --> 03:43:04.251]  And I read it and I was like, you know what?
[03:43:04.271 --> 03:43:06.495]  I don't care anymore.
[03:43:06.515 --> 03:43:08.799]  I don't care anymore.
[03:43:09.500 --> 03:43:12.366]  Because, again, I'm at least trying.
[03:43:13.127 --> 03:43:13.708]  And they're not.
[03:43:14.685 --> 03:43:19.949]  So, the power is in the person who's trying, regardless of the success.
[03:43:20.449 --> 03:43:22.730]  If you're trying, you've got all the power.
[03:43:23.051 --> 03:43:24.352]  You're driving the agenda.
[03:43:24.652 --> 03:43:25.612]  You're doing all this stuff.
[03:43:25.632 --> 03:43:31.436]  Like, I just introduced Green New Deal two weeks ago, and it's creating all of this conversation.
[03:43:31.616 --> 03:43:31.957]  Why?
[03:43:32.257 --> 03:43:34.098]  Because no one else has even tried.
[03:43:34.839 --> 03:43:36.360]  Because no one else has even tried.
[03:43:36.380 --> 03:43:38.461]  So people are like, oh, it's unrealistic.
[03:43:38.921 --> 03:43:39.682]  Oh, it's vague.
[03:43:39.922 --> 03:43:42.203]  Oh, it doesn't address this little minute thing.
[03:43:42.404 --> 03:43:43.865]  And I'm like, you try!
[03:43:45.566 --> 03:43:46.286]  You do it.
[03:43:46.326 --> 03:43:48.167]  Because you're not.
[03:43:48.788 --> 03:43:49.628]  Because you're not.
[03:43:50.449 --> 03:43:53.250]  So until you do it, I'm the boss.
[03:43:53.330 --> 03:43:54.631]  How about that?
[03:43:56.872 --> 03:43:57.353]  Look at me.
[03:43:57.433 --> 03:43:57.713]  Sure.
[03:43:58.573 --> 03:43:59.034]  Look at me.
[03:43:59.074 --> 03:43:59.354]  Sure.
[03:43:59.474 --> 03:44:00.335]  I'm the captain now.
[03:44:01.495 --> 03:44:04.957]  So until you do it, I'm the boss.
[03:44:05.137 --> 03:44:06.518]  I'm the captain now.

[03:45:05.459 --> 03:45:26.294]  If you're sick of mainstream news promoting fake hate crime stories and running with that, making that the big story, amplifying the hate crime that was totally fake, that they probably all knew was fake, but they wanted to go along with it because they hate America and they're racists, if you'd like to stick your finger in their eye, if you'd like to see people like Jesse Smollett shown up, go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:26.394 --> 03:45:26.874]  You know what?
[03:45:27.254 --> 03:45:28.395]  Let me just do this right now.
[03:45:28.555 --> 03:45:29.376]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[03:45:30.386 --> 03:45:33.688]  So these are the brand new protein bars at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:33.728 --> 03:45:34.608]  I got a box of them right here.
[03:45:34.628 --> 03:45:35.589]  You should buy a whole box.
[03:45:35.789 --> 03:45:36.949]  You should buy five boxes.
[03:45:36.969 --> 03:45:38.430]  It's 40% off when you buy two or more.
[03:45:38.590 --> 03:45:40.711]  I'm just going to show you what you're dealing with these protein bars.
[03:45:40.751 --> 03:45:45.613]  So first, you've got the outer layer, which is basically just a peanut butter outer layer.
[03:45:45.633 --> 03:45:46.794]  I mean, who doesn't like peanut butter?
[03:45:46.834 --> 03:45:47.474]  Very healthy.
[03:45:48.394 --> 03:45:49.375]  Good oils in there.
[03:45:49.595 --> 03:45:50.555]  The omega-3s.
[03:45:51.136 --> 03:45:52.256]  And it's got a great taste.
[03:45:52.816 --> 03:45:57.238]  So the peanut butter outer shell is what you see here originally.
[03:45:57.278 --> 03:45:58.379]  But then you bust it open.
[03:45:59.409 --> 03:46:03.111]  And inside, it looks like a double fudge brownie with peanuts in it.
[03:46:03.232 --> 03:46:05.433]  So I mean, honestly, it doesn't even taste like a protein bar.
[03:46:05.473 --> 03:46:06.954]  You wouldn't think you were eating a protein bar.
[03:46:06.974 --> 03:46:11.637]  You'd think you were eating some gourmet double fudge brownie chocolate bar combination.
[03:46:11.837 --> 03:46:12.738]  It really is that good.
[03:46:12.878 --> 03:46:15.960]  So it's the InfoWars Live Protein Bar at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:46:16.500 --> 03:46:18.562]  Alright, I busted open a protein bar.
[03:46:18.602 --> 03:46:20.983]  Now I'm just forcing myself to eat the whole thing here.
[03:46:21.003 --> 03:46:21.864]  I'm a little hungry.
[03:46:23.735 --> 03:46:24.375]  This is disgusting.
[03:46:24.395 --> 03:46:26.357]  You don't want to hear me eating this.
[03:46:27.277 --> 03:46:29.459]  I just shoved the whole protein bar in my mouth, folks.
[03:46:29.699 --> 03:46:30.439]  I could eat 10 more.
[03:46:30.500 --> 03:46:30.660]  Mmm.
[03:46:30.940 --> 03:46:31.100]  Mmm.
[03:46:31.300 --> 03:46:32.921]  I feel like I just had a chocolate sin.
[03:46:32.941 --> 03:46:33.241]  Mmm.
[03:46:33.341 --> 03:46:36.003]  Man, you could, like, break that up and put it on ice cream.
[03:46:36.023 --> 03:46:37.204]  It's just the best brownie.
[03:46:37.244 --> 03:46:37.904]  The crew loves it.
[03:46:37.944 --> 03:46:40.006]  The crew is, like, purchasing this thing off the shelf.
[03:46:40.186 --> 03:46:42.367]  I've got boxes on the way to my house as well.
[03:46:42.848 --> 03:46:44.789]  And I use all kinds of products from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:46:44.809 --> 03:46:47.611]  I have two Alexa Pure Breeze air filters in my home.
[03:46:47.791 --> 03:46:50.313]  I've got the Alexa Pure water filter.
[03:46:50.473 --> 03:46:51.333]  These are products you need.
[03:46:51.353 --> 03:46:53.695]  I use the Infowars Life toothpaste, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[03:46:53.775 --> 03:46:55.056]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:24.824 --> 03:47:31.907]  This is the end, beautiful friend.
[03:47:34.168 --> 03:47:37.690]  This is the end, my friend.
[03:47:38.070 --> 03:47:42.692]  No, Alex, I, I, cause I, this'll drive me insane, and, and as soon as we're done talking I'm gonna remember it.
[03:47:43.152 --> 03:47:44.993]  It was a giant tunnel that they're building.
[03:47:45.873 --> 03:47:47.174]  And it may have been in Helsinki.
[03:47:47.974 --> 03:47:50.075]  And they had a giant party to celebrate this.
[03:47:51.721 --> 03:47:57.345]  I mean, I remember there was a big tunnel over in El Cid, or whatever, that the big bus and the kids all crashed into and died.
[03:47:57.705 --> 03:47:58.445]  Listen, listen.
[03:47:58.945 --> 03:48:07.471]  Francois Mitterrand got the big glass pyramid that Macron was sworn in on front of.
[03:48:08.491 --> 03:48:10.232]  In front of the Louvre?
[03:48:10.273 --> 03:48:11.833]  With 666... I was just there.
[03:48:12.154 --> 03:48:13.815]  I was just there.
[03:48:13.855 --> 03:48:15.576]  666 pieces of glass.
[03:48:15.836 --> 03:48:16.016]  Right.
[03:48:16.216 --> 03:48:18.898]  And he pledged it to Lucifer, and that was in the newspaper.
[03:48:19.790 --> 03:48:21.511]  Well, how about Christian Bale thanking Satan?
[03:48:22.771 --> 03:48:26.173]  I mean, ha ha, but is good winning?
[03:48:26.733 --> 03:48:28.194]  What's happening right now, Alex?
[03:48:28.454 --> 03:48:32.796]  If you're keeping score, and I know you are, are the good guys winning or losing right now?
[03:48:32.876 --> 03:48:36.578]  Or is it just the illusion that evil is winning because that's what they report?
[03:48:37.478 --> 03:48:41.520]  There is a giant interdimensional alien invasion taking place.
[03:48:42.344 --> 03:48:57.081]  Through the cell phones, through the electromagnetic radiation, through the cyclotrons, the superconducting super colliders, there are enemies, there are enemy traders, collaborators in the human species, working with Satan and his fallen legions.
[03:48:58.978 --> 03:49:14.864]  At our dimensional level, but also at the interdimensional level of the brain, to blast huge holes into our dimension, like the Bible says, to literally turn demons loose on the Earth, and the planet is under an interdimensional space invader attack.
[03:49:16.345 --> 03:49:25.248]  The book of Revelations does, not the way you just said it, but does predict that this planet will be filled with horrific creatures.
[03:49:27.141 --> 03:49:34.484]  Unleashed from hell and you believe this is they're trying to bring that about right now Does that also involve the the building of the temple in Israel?
[03:49:34.864 --> 03:49:35.545]  Is that part of it?
[03:49:36.565 --> 03:49:51.931]  All of it is a countdown and that's why you see the new pope Saying how to visit Christian and all this crazy stuff is it's all coming out in the open the pedophilia is all coming out It's all coming out and they can't have me on air to talk about this at this critical point How do we fight back?
[03:49:51.951 --> 03:49:53.872]  How do good people fight back Alex?
[03:49:56.334 --> 03:50:06.556]  Good people need to get right with God and know that most of these churches are controlled by their denomination and their 501c3, and most of these preachers are basically false prophets.
[03:50:07.036 --> 03:50:15.197]  People need to get on their knees and pray to God and ask for guidance, and just ask Jesus to come to their heart and say, God, this is so big, this is so evil what we're facing.
[03:50:15.637 --> 03:50:16.418]  I don't know what to do.
[03:50:17.158 --> 03:50:18.078]  God's about free will.
[03:50:18.138 --> 03:50:20.018]  Demons in these systems want to trick you.
[03:50:20.458 --> 03:50:21.118]  They hate free will.
[03:50:21.438 --> 03:50:23.339]  You have to say, God, I ask you into my heart.
[03:50:23.399 --> 03:50:24.299]  I ask for your protection.
[03:50:24.799 --> 03:50:26.741]  And I ask you to send angels to protect me and my children.
[03:50:27.161 --> 03:50:31.504]  And I ask you to open up the gates of perception and give me the discernment to deal with this.
[03:50:31.544 --> 03:50:32.845]  And I'm on my knees and I'll repent.
[03:50:33.165 --> 03:50:38.869]  And if you do that, if you do that, ladies and gentlemen, if you do that, the Holy Ghost will come to you and it's real.
[03:50:39.490 --> 03:50:45.234]  And instead of being possessed by this devilish energy, and everybody's got this devilish energy in them, it's going to push back.
[03:50:45.634 --> 03:50:50.298]  But if you just push long enough, the Holy Spirit comes in and the evil pretty much isn't there anymore.
[03:50:51.707 --> 03:50:53.068]  I always say, send an email.
[03:50:53.608 --> 03:50:55.149]  Down on your knees, don't send an email.
[03:50:56.290 --> 03:51:03.794]  And what you talk about, look, I went to Harvest, one of the biggest mega-churches on earth, a guy named James McDonald.
[03:51:04.755 --> 03:51:07.716]  And, you know, I got to see behind the curtain.
[03:51:09.037 --> 03:51:18.583]  And what I saw was, man, we need to remember that Satan can quote the Bible.
[03:51:20.595 --> 03:51:26.098]  And Alex, what you said is so powerful.
[03:51:28.720 --> 03:51:30.821]  You and I have discussed this stuff for years.
[03:51:31.121 --> 03:51:35.824]  This is what we talk about, folks, when we talk off radio stations.
[03:51:35.864 --> 03:51:37.645]  We talk about God and family.
[03:51:39.627 --> 03:51:42.648]  Alex, so physically, what happens?
[03:51:44.068 --> 03:51:49.611]  I had a guy on talking about, this guy Dr. Ted was on talking about, scalar waves and all this, and I didn't quite understand it.
[03:51:50.431 --> 03:51:52.252]  So, what does praying do?
[03:51:52.272 --> 03:51:59.836]  I mean, I pray, and I pray with my family, and every meal we pray, and I encourage people to do that.
[03:52:00.977 --> 03:52:02.138]  But I always pray for wisdom.
[03:52:03.035 --> 03:52:04.376]  You pray for knowledge, I pray for wisdom.
[03:52:04.416 --> 03:52:05.317]  I guess it's the same thing.
[03:52:06.077 --> 03:52:08.539]  What do you think happens when we pray?
[03:52:08.659 --> 03:52:13.783]  When we pray to God versus these people that are trying to create little black holes and let in demonic forces?
[03:52:15.324 --> 03:52:15.804]  What happens?
[03:52:16.565 --> 03:52:17.806]  What's happening on the good side?
[03:52:18.006 --> 03:52:20.668]  Angels are being sent out?
[03:52:21.929 --> 03:52:23.190]  Well, exactly.
[03:52:23.210 --> 03:52:25.612]  To protect you and to beat back the evil?
[03:52:26.672 --> 03:52:27.033]  Exactly.
[03:52:27.053 --> 03:52:28.414]  The devil operates in secret.
[03:52:29.855 --> 03:52:31.316]  Satan operates against free will.
[03:52:32.202 --> 03:52:35.124]  So God isn't going to open the channel up to you.
[03:52:35.144 --> 03:52:40.628]  Except sometimes your family's praying for you, then it happens because that's the bridge.
[03:52:40.668 --> 03:52:41.509]  God's about free will.
[03:52:41.909 --> 03:52:45.252]  You have to open up the interdimensional bat signal.
[03:52:46.483 --> 03:52:50.125]  And when you open yourself up to God, a lot of people are going to be demonically influenced.
[03:52:50.165 --> 03:52:54.649]  They're going to feel something pushing it, something in the way, something saying, don't do that, don't do that.
[03:52:54.689 --> 03:53:05.017]  You're saying, no, I call out to Jesus, I call out to God, make contact with me, help me, cleanse me, give me discernment, give me wisdom, please help me, please help me help others, please.
[03:53:06.137 --> 03:53:06.818]  And then it happens.
[03:53:07.238 --> 03:53:08.539]  And then that connection starts.
[03:53:09.400 --> 03:53:11.962]  And a lot of times, right up front,
[03:53:12.859 --> 03:53:15.581]  You'll walk into work and somebody will walk up and start a fight with you right away.
[03:53:15.601 --> 03:53:17.783]  And you'll go, whoa, this is like a movie.
[03:53:17.984 --> 03:53:18.704]  I've had it happen.
[03:53:19.185 --> 03:53:19.785]  I've had it happen.
[03:53:19.825 --> 03:53:20.406]  It's really mean.
[03:53:21.066 --> 03:53:23.528]  I encourage listeners to do this.
[03:53:24.429 --> 03:53:25.290]  It is something, man.
[03:53:25.330 --> 03:53:28.373]  If you set out today or tomorrow and say, I'm going to do good.
[03:53:28.753 --> 03:53:29.293]  I'm going to do good.
[03:53:29.313 --> 03:53:29.854]  I'm going to be good.
[03:53:29.894 --> 03:53:30.915]  I'm going to be for God today.
[03:53:30.935 --> 03:53:32.296]  You will not believe what happens to you.
[03:53:37.631 --> 03:53:39.833]  I was joking with my guy here, Lovecheese, earlier.
[03:53:39.853 --> 03:53:41.654]  I was saying, man, I pray.
[03:53:41.694 --> 03:53:42.175]  I feel great.
[03:53:42.195 --> 03:53:42.775]  I leave the house.
[03:53:42.835 --> 03:53:43.596]  I love mankind.
[03:53:43.636 --> 03:53:47.119]  And then, of course, you have to go outside.
[03:53:47.419 --> 03:53:48.740]  Was Andrew Breitbart murdered?
[03:53:48.760 --> 03:53:51.362]  I think he was.
[03:53:51.382 --> 03:53:52.984]  And then everybody around him was so scared.
[03:53:53.544 --> 03:53:54.605]  And the coroner was killed.
[03:53:55.786 --> 03:53:57.768]  Guys like me and you said, what happened with Breitbart?
[03:53:58.528 --> 03:54:00.370]  And there was an investigation.
[03:54:00.390 --> 03:54:01.471]  And then that guy was murdered.
[03:54:02.165 --> 03:54:26.758]  By the way, we talked about a month ago about you coming on the show and me coming on the show, and you brought this up, and then I went back and pulled up LA Times articles where the coroner said, I think there's foul play, he's dead two days later from a heavy arsenic poisoning, he's murdered, and then that gets shut down, and no investigation's done, and so absolutely, they killed Andrew Breitbart.
[03:54:26.918 --> 03:54:29.279]  Andrew Breitbart talked to me the night he died.
[03:54:30.131 --> 03:54:40.740]  We were working on a TV show together that you'll remember, and he told me he had video footage that the second the world saw it, it would be the end of the Obamas, the end of the Clintons, and more.
[03:54:41.661 --> 03:54:44.763]  And that it was so extreme and so over the top and not what we thought.
[03:54:44.803 --> 03:54:45.704]  And I asked him, was it this?
[03:54:45.744 --> 03:54:46.184]  Was it that?
[03:54:46.244 --> 03:54:49.667]  Was it... And maybe it's tied to what we've read in those Modesto emails.
[03:54:49.767 --> 03:54:50.168]  I don't know.
[03:54:50.328 --> 03:54:51.649]  Alex, my final question.
[03:54:52.610 --> 03:54:54.071]  Are you afraid you're going to be assassinated?
[03:54:55.748 --> 03:54:56.909]  You know, I'm not afraid of it.
[03:54:57.029 --> 03:54:59.891]  I mean, I think there's obviously a good chance of that.
[03:55:01.252 --> 03:55:13.280]  They try to wind up enough crazy people or whatever to do it, but they have to first destroy my name completely and then just create a lie where I once was so that, you know, once I'm gone, then they can capture
[03:55:14.240 --> 03:55:20.864]  Uh, capture me and build a straw man so that I can then be an avatar or a character into the future.
[03:55:21.324 --> 03:55:22.225]  That's what the devil loves to do.
[03:55:22.245 --> 03:55:33.031]  Take somebody good, take something strong, take something that had big success for humanity and then shut it up and then build a counterfeit that you claim is that thing and then have it speak for you.
[03:55:33.251 --> 03:55:35.352]  I mean like this Homeland TV show they admit is based on me.
[03:55:36.349 --> 03:55:40.792]  And, you know, he's this horrible lying demon who hurts people and is a racist and everything.
[03:55:41.273 --> 03:55:42.433]  And then it's the opposite of who I am.
[03:55:42.493 --> 03:55:43.514]  I mean, but that's what they did.
[03:55:43.554 --> 03:55:44.575]  It's part of a larger plan.
[03:55:45.195 --> 03:55:46.937]  So, yes, they have to finish destroying me.
[03:55:48.037 --> 03:55:51.700]  And then they do plan to either put me in prison or take me out.
[03:55:52.120 --> 03:55:53.881]  But, you know, I mean, that's just what's got to be done.
[03:55:53.901 --> 03:55:55.863]  And I'm closer to God than I've ever been.
[03:55:55.883 --> 03:55:59.966]  And, you know, getting close to God for a while, a lot of really bad things happen.
[03:56:00.006 --> 03:56:02.968]  But you get to a certain point where it's like an event horizon and it's just like,
[03:56:03.698 --> 03:56:13.964]  It's like nothing they do matters anymore, and then all these other great doors open, and then God opens up the perception to a level just unbelievably breathtaking, and then there's one thing you know you gotta do.
[03:56:14.344 --> 03:56:27.592]  Make sure that these little souls, these little children, these innocent people around us, make sure we stand up for them so that we can protect them and get them under God's wings and get them into the future for eternity with all these great people and our ancestors that are all waiting for us beyond the veil.
[03:56:29.690 --> 03:56:33.412]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle.
[03:56:33.432 --> 03:56:34.592]  There's a guy named Alex Jones.
[03:56:34.672 --> 03:56:35.513]  Alex Jones.
[03:56:35.533 --> 03:56:36.533]  From Infowars.
[03:56:36.613 --> 03:56:37.233]  From Infowars.
[03:56:37.273 --> 03:56:37.473]  Yeah.
[03:56:37.613 --> 03:56:38.274]  Alex Jones.
[03:56:38.374 --> 03:56:39.154]  Alex Jones.
[03:56:39.234 --> 03:56:42.616]  One of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[03:56:42.676 --> 03:56:45.477]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[03:56:45.537 --> 03:56:50.399]  Claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[03:56:50.479 --> 03:56:55.121]  The conspiracy du jour, Hillary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition.
[03:56:55.281 --> 03:56:57.282]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you, Alex?
[03:56:57.942 --> 03:57:00.664]  I'm really not Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[03:57:00.704 --> 03:57:09.970]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton's body count story.
[03:57:09.990 --> 03:57:11.651]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[03:57:11.731 --> 03:57:13.992]  And this really is just so disgusting.
[03:57:14.012 --> 03:57:16.534]  The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex Jones.
[03:57:20.169 --> 03:57:22.891]  It goes right from Alex Jones, and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth.
[03:57:22.911 --> 03:57:25.593]  Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama.
[03:57:26.053 --> 03:57:32.197]  The very fringe of the conspiracy movement, like Alex Jones, are being kind of incorporated into the campaign.
[03:57:32.237 --> 03:57:34.398]  If Trump gets elected, he's gonna be Secretary of Defense.
[03:57:34.418 --> 03:57:36.339]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[03:57:36.379 --> 03:57:37.940]  Move, bitch!
[03:57:37.960 --> 03:57:38.921]  Get out the way!
[03:57:39.081 --> 03:57:41.082]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, Infowars.com.
[03:57:41.303 --> 03:57:42.503]  Bill Clinton's a rapist!
[03:57:44.045 --> 03:57:45.206]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:57:45.366 --> 03:57:46.327]  InfoWars.com.
[03:57:46.427 --> 03:57:47.448]  InfoWars.com.
[03:57:47.508 --> 03:57:48.369]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[03:57:48.529 --> 03:57:50.651]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[03:57:52.112 --> 03:57:55.656]  InfoWars.com.
[03:57:55.796 --> 03:57:59.720]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.

[03:58:05.433 --> 03:58:09.635]  This isn't like your average show, like, oh, we're the cutting edge, oh, the Tepesperos support us.
[03:58:10.356 --> 03:58:15.138]  We are in absolute contention, in war with the globalists.
[03:58:16.195 --> 03:58:19.139]  We are taking them on at point-blank range.
[03:58:19.379 --> 03:58:23.504]  And if you go to the establishment hotels or go to establishment grocery stores, I don't judge you.
[03:58:23.544 --> 03:58:24.045]  We all do it.
[03:58:24.125 --> 03:58:25.086]  That's all you can buy from.
[03:58:25.126 --> 03:58:31.614]  But if you just get your coffee, organic, high-quality, Inforestore.com, five stars, third-party review sites, Wake of America Coffee.

[03:58:55.595 --> 03:58:56.355]  No reviews yet.
[03:58:56.375 --> 03:58:57.376]  We just went on sale today.
[03:58:57.396 --> 03:58:58.737]  How will the media demonize that?
