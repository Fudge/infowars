[00:00:06.064 --> 00:00:11.770]  But a young man who's got very little going for himself except he's got a great first name.
[00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:11.890]  He is
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.401]  He challenged us.
[00:00:30.603 --> 00:00:33.566]  So we have, let's say, 35,000 people tonight, and he has 200 people, 300 people.
[00:00:33.586 --> 00:00:34.367]  Not too good.
[00:00:39.577 --> 00:00:47.702]  Of course, following the El Paso, Texas Beto vs. Trump challenge, numbers for those in attendance were all over the map.
[00:00:47.963 --> 00:00:55.027]  Claims from 65 people to over 10,000 are floating around for the turnout for Beto O'Rourke.
[00:00:55.187 --> 00:01:00.131]  However, video from Beto's speech shows a very sparse crowd.
[00:01:00.591 --> 00:01:09.277]  In fact, C-SPAN mysteriously dropped their coverage of the Beto O'Rourke rally at the last minute, while Trump's numbers were blatantly obvious.
[00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:12.180]  Thank you very much, El Paso.
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.261]  Thank you very much.
[00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:22.350]  Unlike Beto's rally, Trump's rally was infiltrated by flare-ups of anti-Trump protesters.
[00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:27.736]  Is there any place that's more fun to be than a Trump rally?
[00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:52.682]  In fact, the Gateway Pundit reported that the Latino man that reportedly violently attacked a BBC reporter in the nest of the mainstream media may have been doing what is known as bird-dogging, a far-left tactic where you pretend to be a Trump supporter, as he still had a tag on his MAGA hat and he was awkwardly disappeared right after the incident.
[00:01:52.782 --> 00:01:53.943]  Oh, look at all the press spec.
[00:01:53.963 --> 00:01:54.643]  Do you believe that?
[00:01:58.772 --> 00:02:01.710]  This is like the Academy Awards used to be.
[00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:02.394]  Used to be.
[00:02:04.537 --> 00:02:08.240]  They've gone down a long way since they started hitting us a little bit, right?
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.301]  They've gone down.
[00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:12.083]  That was a long, that was a long fall.
[00:02:12.483 --> 00:02:13.264]  But there they are.
[00:02:13.504 --> 00:02:21.270]  Of course, the media will run with this as they continue to blame Trump for every conceivable thing under the sun.
[00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:31.638]  For instance, impeachment zealot Al Green's insistence that Trump is responsible for Virginia Governor Northam and his attorney general's blackface embarrassment.
[00:02:31.778 --> 00:02:34.480]  But President Trump addressed that issue with
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.221]  Democrats are also pushing extreme late-term abortion.
[00:02:47.263 --> 00:02:54.145]  Allowing children to be ripped from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth.
[00:02:54.685 --> 00:02:56.025]  What's that all about?
[00:02:56.045 --> 00:03:00.286]  So in Virginia, the governor, he's gotten a little publicity lately.
[00:03:02.654 --> 00:03:03.154]  I like him.
[00:03:03.194 --> 00:03:04.455]  Keeps us out of the papers.
[00:03:04.535 --> 00:03:06.116]  I like him.
[00:03:06.136 --> 00:03:08.177]  I'd like to find a few more guys like this one.
[00:03:08.977 --> 00:03:10.118]  He almost moonwalked.
[00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:11.098]  His wife stopped him.
[00:03:11.338 --> 00:03:13.519]  Darling, darling, it would be inappropriate.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:24.105]  But the governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world.
[00:03:25.228 --> 00:03:34.919]  And wrap the baby, and make the baby comfortable, and then talk to the mother, and talk to the father, and then execute the baby.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.301]  Execute the baby.
[00:03:37.422 --> 00:03:43.449]  Millions of innocent, beautiful babies are counting on us to protect them, and we will.
[00:03:45.262 --> 00:03:52.344]  In fact, if you look at McAllen, if you look at San Diego, if you look at all points in between, the U.S.
[00:03:52.424 --> 00:03:56.425]  cities of the U.S.-Mexico border are far safer than the U.S.
[00:03:56.465 --> 00:04:00.387]  cities deeper in the interior of the United States of America.
[00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:14.711]  It all came down to the wall, and Beto and his supporters are on the wrong side of that wall, and history, and the truth, and the border, for that matter, as the majority of Beto's supporters were holding Mexican flags.
[00:04:19.072 --> 00:04:24.474]  What happened in El Paso was a preview of what's to come as 2020 draws closer.
[00:04:24.654 --> 00:04:31.735]  We can surely expect the Democrats to roll out more deception and a contempt for common sense.
[00:04:32.176 --> 00:04:33.416]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:04:34.756 --> 00:04:36.797]  If you are receiving this transmission,

[00:05:10.745 --> 00:05:11.846]  Ultimate Bone Broth.

[00:05:18.672 --> 00:05:24.838]  This incredible formula will help you get the most out of your workout with the power of ultra high quality bone broth.
[00:05:25.138 --> 00:05:27.360]  One of the most popular health trends on the planet.

[00:06:12.452 --> 00:06:23.054]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial commons.
[00:06:23.434 --> 00:06:28.796]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:34.777]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[00:06:35.397 --> 00:06:36.857]  It is a big idea.
[00:06:36.877 --> 00:06:38.178]  A new world order.
[00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.052]  It was almost as if it were a planned, in quotes, hit-judge pancake.
[00:06:46.152 --> 00:06:49.294]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[00:06:49.394 --> 00:07:07.227]  I also believe in the plot of God on this.
[00:07:07.288 --> 00:07:11.971]  We agree that AK-47s belong to handsome soldiers, not to handsome criminals.
[00:07:16.678 --> 00:07:17.778]  I'm done with low behavior.
[00:07:17.838 --> 00:07:19.999]  No one will be able to beat all of us.
[00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:21.359]  We're gonna take all the others.
[00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:25.060]  For many of us, police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.621]  Is global governance at last?
[00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:29.102]  Is it one world the central bankers in charge?
[00:07:29.122 --> 00:07:32.323]  Aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:07:32.443 --> 00:07:37.504]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:07:37.524 --> 00:07:38.544]  Do you understand?
[00:07:39.285 --> 00:07:43.986]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:07:48.394 --> 00:07:50.516]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:07:51.036 --> 00:07:52.397]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:07:52.757 --> 00:07:56.240]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:04.226 --> 00:08:06.567]  Coming to you from Austin, Texas.
[00:08:07.828 --> 00:08:09.029]  Right here on Planet Earth.
[00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.211]  It's Wednesday, February 13, 2019.
[00:08:13.371 --> 00:08:14.832]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:15.472 --> 00:08:23.156]  Promoting a pro-liberty, pro-truth, pro-human, pro-family, pro-God, pro-beyond-the-stars future.
[00:08:24.757 --> 00:08:25.197]  Globalist.
[00:08:26.037 --> 00:08:27.478]  Promoting the exact opposite.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:36.283]  I'm particularly focused today and I've got a particularly powerful mapped out transmission for you.
[00:08:36.303 --> 00:08:41.946]  And I don't think anybody that's been listening lately can deny the broadcast have been particularly piercing.
[00:08:42.426 --> 00:08:46.629]  But the guests, the research, the reports, everything, because the times demand it.
[00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:58.396]  Many a historian and many an individual like Winston Churchill pointed out that a lot of times it's not that a person's that great, but that they are in incredible times and they step up making themselves great.
[00:08:59.241 --> 00:09:07.507]  And that's where we all are, deciding whether we're going to be bystanders to tyranny and be run over by it, or whether we're going to be part of the animating contest of LibertÃ .
[00:09:08.568 --> 00:09:12.451]  Leo Zagami with unbelievable developments inside the Vatican.
[00:09:12.471 --> 00:09:15.053]  Even the London Guardian says the Vatican is set to collapse.
[00:09:15.554 --> 00:09:17.495]  Four in five priests are gay.
[00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:23.400]  They're reporting that up to 20 to 30 percent are pedophiles, and that it's basically now a giant sex cult.
[00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:25.672]  That's what took it over.
[00:09:26.413 --> 00:09:27.615]  Confirming everything we break down.
[00:09:27.655 --> 00:09:30.498]  He'll be joining us from Rome, Mike Adams, as well.
[00:09:30.538 --> 00:09:35.163]  A bunch of special reports and some surprise guests will probably be popping in, if not today, tomorrow.
[00:09:35.404 --> 00:09:36.285]  I'm gonna leave it at that for you.
[00:09:38.127 --> 00:09:43.033]  Let me just give you a little preview of what's on the menu today.
[00:09:45.134 --> 00:09:48.697]  Trump is expected, we were told this morning, to sign the bipartisan bill.
[00:09:48.737 --> 00:09:50.558]  But he said, no, I haven't seen it yet.
[00:09:51.179 --> 00:10:00.966]  And reportedly, as we speak, at noon eastern, the bill is being transmitted to the White House for the president to look at it.
[00:10:01.907 --> 00:10:07.130]  So Reuters and others were reporting earlier that it was expected.
[00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.953]  Now Reuters is reporting, and it's up on Infowars.com.
[00:10:11.394 --> 00:10:14.196]  Trump noncommittal on weak funding for the border wall.
[00:10:15.202 --> 00:10:22.083]  Says we'll get the $23 billion needed total from other pots of money, and may not even need to declare an emergency.
[00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:26.504]  Well, we'll see what happens with that.
[00:10:26.544 --> 00:10:28.125]  We'll be detailing it more coming up.
[00:10:29.585 --> 00:10:32.886]  Just more upside-down world statements by Democrats we're going to get to.
[00:10:32.906 --> 00:10:42.888]  You know, Beto, I'm sorry, Peto O'Rourke, the carpetbagger here in Texas, with his Bernie Sanders Connecticut accent, nothing against being from Connecticut, it's just, it's funny to
[00:10:44.387 --> 00:10:45.628]  He's got a Connecticut accent.
[00:10:46.569 --> 00:11:00.097]  He is, or Vermont accent I guess, he is running around saying that walls kill people and walls are immoral, while he's all encircled by a wall, and armed police in El Paso, where he gave a speech.
[00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:14.501]  Congressman Menendez, who was very close to being convicted for having sex, reportedly, with 13, 14-year-old girls in the Dominican Republic and other areas, so he doesn't seem to know what criminal activity is.
[00:11:15.062 --> 00:11:17.864]  He says classifying drunk drivers as criminal is wrong.
[00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:19.566]  Yes, you heard me right.
[00:11:20.006 --> 00:11:21.628]  That video is coming up.
[00:11:21.668 --> 00:11:22.329]  It's just insane.
[00:11:22.769 --> 00:11:24.511]  And then Ted Cruz's really great idea.
[00:11:25.612 --> 00:11:26.333]  Really great idea.
[00:11:27.552 --> 00:11:36.597]  Acid forfeiture seizure in general inside CONUS and against citizens is unconstitutional and very dangerous and out of control and I want it reformed.
[00:11:37.526 --> 00:11:38.466]  Until people are convicted.
[00:11:39.367 --> 00:11:40.647]  Then, it's constitutional.
[00:11:41.148 --> 00:11:46.470]  But on the border, Katie bar the door.
[00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:51.952]  That's where you're supposed to seize illegal stuff, and it's just a procedure, and that would fund it.
[00:11:52.132 --> 00:11:57.314]  I mean, $14 billion in the coffers and different assets of El Chapo, that'll fund most of the wall right there.
[00:12:02.256 --> 00:12:10.722]  I'm going to make an announcement right now that if people let this sink in, we'll change the future destiny, not just of this nation, but the world.
[00:12:12.123 --> 00:12:17.066]  It's so huge, but at the same time, it's so incredibly simple.
[00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:20.752]  That it boggles the mind that people don't understand this.
[00:12:20.772 --> 00:12:24.552]  And I know most of you will understand it, and already understand it once I say it.
[00:12:25.293 --> 00:12:33.494]  But it's such a simple idea, and such a true idea, but it's not grasped by most of us, including myself.
[00:12:35.315 --> 00:12:40.436]  When we go and spend money with big globalist, anti-American, anti-family corporations,
[00:12:41.909 --> 00:12:45.579]  We are amassing power for them and allowing them to dictate our lives.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.730]  But they already control almost everything, so it's hard to not.
[00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:53.410]  Go to big establishment corporations.
[00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.491]  It's hard to make the right decisions.
[00:12:55.511 --> 00:13:04.537]  I do a lot of research now about where our crew goes, what hotels they stay at, what we do, just trying to make sure we can find companies that are neutral and aren't anti-American.
[00:13:05.157 --> 00:13:06.238]  And Americans have voted.
[00:13:06.618 --> 00:13:09.980]  The Super Bowl was down 35%, the NFL's down 45% total.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:16.024]  Same thing with the Oscars are down 80% in the last decade, the Emmys, the Grammys.
[00:13:18.129 --> 00:13:22.351]  The left is committing cultural and political suicide in front of all of us.
[00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:24.732]  So we voted culturally by tuning out.
[00:13:25.373 --> 00:13:27.074]  Problem is they just target our kids in the school.
[00:13:27.134 --> 00:13:36.618]  So what I'm getting at here is what you do with your word of mouth and what you do with your financial decisions you make is one of the most powerful votes you have.
[00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:47.624]  And the left is using boycotts and harassment and brigading and censorship and intimidation and antifa to try to crush nationalists from simply trying to be able to live our lives
[00:13:48.882 --> 00:13:49.582]  The way we wish.
[00:13:49.983 --> 00:13:52.044]  And they're using our open, free society against us.
[00:13:52.664 --> 00:14:09.314]  But I was just sitting back last night thinking about the fact that they have all these Washington Posts and all these New York Observer and all these articles saying Alex Jones is evil, he sells coffee, he sells horrible foods, he sells high quality supplements like fish oil, which everybody knows is great, and turmeric.
[00:14:10.896 --> 00:14:17.741]  But they demonize that while every grocery store sells stuff that's adulterated, not as good, and Whole Foods does, and Amazon does.
[00:14:18.001 --> 00:14:29.270]  But Jeff Bezos' own Washington Post then attacks me and says, oh look, snake oil, even though a bunch of our products are private-labeled, highest quality, that's actually sold in Whole Foods.
[00:14:30.626 --> 00:14:35.328]  That is where we get our private-labeled products, some of which aren't proprietary or private-labeled because they're high-quality.
[00:14:36.028 --> 00:14:36.769]  It's sold by them.
[00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:39.510]  So they just don't want us funding ourselves.
[00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:49.595]  And if you'll simply get the Wake Up America coffee of your coffee drinkers and sign up for AutoShip, if you'll simply sign up for AutoShip every month for the Gloidal Silver Iodine Fortified Toothpaste, it'll change the world.
[00:14:50.255 --> 00:14:54.837]  It's just things you need over and over again, and then we can fight Soros and Hillary and hold the line.
[00:14:54.917 --> 00:14:55.417]  But that's it.
[00:14:55.437 --> 00:14:56.958]  And I'll talk more about it later.
[00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:03.210]  The average protein bar sold at Whole Foods or even a gas station is about $4.50.
[00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.252]  They're adulterated, they're full of crap.
[00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:12.456]  We went out to some of the top firms, got bids, put out very tasty, delicious, had focus groups test them.
[00:15:12.876 --> 00:15:22.602]  We actually went out and did marketing in multiple cities to see what was the tastiest, best, healthiest protein bar that we can sell to you at regular price for $3.
[00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:26.585]  Discounted out of the gates, it's

[00:17:09.739 --> 00:17:13.761]  This isn't words because not everybody hears hype and there's thousands of channels and
[00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:16.369]  This is the channel they're trying to shut down.
[00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:17.730]  This is what they don't want on there.
[00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:19.170]  This is the wild card.
[00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.691]  Time and time again, when nobody else is covering it, we're covering it.
[00:17:22.831 --> 00:17:24.332]  It breaks out, and it defeats them.
[00:17:24.492 --> 00:17:27.993]  So, if you want to defeat the globalists, just keep doing what you've already been doing.
[00:17:28.033 --> 00:17:33.375]  Remember that, yeah, you can get censored or banned on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook for promoting it at fullworse.com links.
[00:17:33.395 --> 00:17:34.015]  We make it easier.
[00:17:34.075 --> 00:17:34.975]  Promote a NewsWorse link.
[00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:36.796]  That doesn't get you banned 10% as much.
[00:17:36.836 --> 00:17:37.516]  But who cares?
[00:17:37.876 --> 00:17:40.517]  They built these platforms to get us in there like a web.
[00:17:41.337 --> 00:17:47.279]  So the spiders would have us caught and come up and say, do what we say or we'll not let you talk to people.
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.240]  And you go, okay, and they get you tied around the web.
[00:17:51.081 --> 00:17:53.562]  And then pretty soon it's like, you can't get free now.
[00:17:53.922 --> 00:17:55.442]  Mmm, delicious.
[00:17:55.983 --> 00:18:04.926]  And that's exactly who Jack Dorsey and all these people are, smart ass spiders that all screw each other and lie and just, oh yeah.
[00:18:06.619 --> 00:18:09.224]  We've got a Bitcoin pump and dump.
[00:18:09.344 --> 00:18:11.268]  I dumped my stock before it plunged.
[00:18:11.468 --> 00:18:15.175]  And now I'm gonna sucker you back in for square cash.
[00:18:20.254 --> 00:18:21.535]  That's how the spider operates.
[00:18:21.655 --> 00:18:23.357]  We gotta learn to recognize the spider.
[00:18:23.457 --> 00:18:25.159]  It's in love with itself.
[00:18:25.459 --> 00:18:26.340]  It's fallen.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.803]  And it's so sure of itself and how it can destroy everything around it.
[00:18:29.863 --> 00:18:31.485]  But we're here to say no.
[00:18:31.705 --> 00:18:40.354]  Info Wars has been chosen out of the spectrum of resistance because it's one of the leading lights.
[00:18:41.923 --> 00:18:43.384]  The spiders don't like light.
[00:18:43.644 --> 00:18:44.204]  They like dark.
[00:18:44.904 --> 00:18:52.268]  And so if they're able, they believe, to shut us down, they believe they've killed a major nexus point for human expression and human freedom.
[00:18:52.608 --> 00:18:54.649]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[00:18:55.189 --> 00:18:56.070]  I can tell you this.
[00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.491]  The fact that we're persecuted shows we're over the target.
[00:18:59.011 --> 00:19:08.239]  We just have to hold on a few more years into the future for things we're going to do that don't just give us the big victories you've already delivered, the listeners, by supporting us.
[00:19:08.319 --> 00:19:09.060]  We're all in this together.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:14.444]  But to even bigger victories that make what humanity's got to go through a lot easier.
[00:19:14.644 --> 00:19:16.246]  And I realize that's the commitment.
[00:19:16.306 --> 00:19:18.788]  If I'm willing to go all the way, and if you're willing to go all the way,
[00:19:19.108 --> 00:19:29.215]  There's going to be major dividends for our children and for society and culture where, you know, only a billion people are going to die in this Armageddon instead of like seven billion.
[00:19:29.915 --> 00:19:32.077]  I mean, seriously, like, it's kind of choose your adventure.
[00:19:32.857 --> 00:19:40.543]  If we really get involved now and say no to all this up front, then we're going to go through this metamorphosis and it's going to be rough, but it'll be okay.
[00:19:41.363 --> 00:19:46.407]  If we don't, I tell you, it's a very, very hard road we're going down.
[00:19:47.027 --> 00:19:51.390]  And so, I would just ask everybody to really search their heart and soul and commit to this fight.
[00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:52.671]  Thank you all for your financial support.
[00:19:52.911 --> 00:19:55.092]  That's Beyond Critical and FullRestore.com.
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.682]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.853 --> 00:20:29.816]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:30.676 --> 00:20:35.679]  Hide what you have to hide, and tell what you have to tell.
[00:20:53.587 --> 00:20:58.391]  While everybody else in the media is keeping their head down, we're charging forward.
[00:20:59.352 --> 00:21:00.413]  We're delivering the goods.
[00:21:01.974 --> 00:21:07.879]  Because we can't let the women and children down.
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.860]  There's still got to be men.
[00:21:11.462 --> 00:21:12.503]  The globalists fear men.
[00:21:13.804 --> 00:21:18.648]  Everything they do is to target men, to dumb them down, to confuse them, to arrest their development.
[00:21:19.468 --> 00:21:23.892]  Because men carry the will to defend the species.
[00:21:24.632 --> 00:21:26.514]  Women are the species.
[00:21:26.574 --> 00:21:27.775]  And our union is holy.
[00:21:28.635 --> 00:21:31.257]  And the enemy is attacking that with everything it's got.
[00:21:32.098 --> 00:21:33.639]  Attacking this planet we're on.
[00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:39.324]  The fallen one that fell to terra firma is amongst us.
[00:21:39.984 --> 00:21:40.745]  Make no mistake.
[00:21:41.385 --> 00:21:44.488]  You can see the shape of what's already here and the shape of things to come.
[00:21:45.429 --> 00:21:46.890]  Not of this world.
[00:21:50.356 --> 00:21:55.717]  But the God of this world, little G. All right, here's what I want to do.
[00:21:57.618 --> 00:22:03.039]  Next segment, I've had time to sit back and watch Howard Schultz.
[00:22:04.379 --> 00:22:06.760]  And I didn't want to say this a few weeks ago, but I'm sure of it now.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.040]  And I know what his plan is.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.361]  We'll get to that next segment.
[00:22:12.021 --> 00:22:15.482]  Also, we're going to look at how that ties in with
[00:22:19.821 --> 00:22:29.248]  We'll also look at how that ties into Bill Gates pushing for quote, higher taxes on the rich, which when you realize the scam he's running, it's just outrageous.
[00:22:29.748 --> 00:22:30.429]  That's coming up.
[00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:48.042]  Also, I keep warning everybody that they had 50-50 votes on the Democratic Party Telecommunications Commission and on the FCC to start regulating the internet.
[00:22:49.056 --> 00:22:56.920]  And they had 10 different senators, remember, a few years ago, call for regulating Drudge Report and Infowars and Reitbart saying, just shut us down because our speech is political.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.980]  They say that's a political gift.
[00:22:58.241 --> 00:22:59.481]  They can all be political all day.
[00:23:00.742 --> 00:23:07.465]  Well, Democrat who sought to regulate Drudge running to represent Silicon Valley and California Senate.
[00:23:08.286 --> 00:23:10.767]  So we're going to look at that as well.
[00:23:12.802 --> 00:23:15.645]  And we're going to get into the latest, what appears to be a false flag.
[00:23:15.665 --> 00:23:20.169]  I mean, I said the day it came out, a week and a half ago, I said, this just sounds like a total false flag.
[00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:26.836]  In the middle of a blizzard, it's 20 below when this happened, or even more below.
[00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:29.611]  I've seen numbers even higher than that.
[00:23:30.331 --> 00:23:38.915]  And two dudes in MAGA hats and ski masks attacked some guy who's got a hit TV show for total PR.
[00:23:39.095 --> 00:23:41.957]  But there's cameras all over that area, dumbass.
[00:23:42.477 --> 00:23:44.538]  So the police have you coming out of the building, going to your car.
[00:23:44.558 --> 00:23:45.358]  No one attacks you.
[00:23:47.539 --> 00:23:52.382]  And I'm telling you, 99% of these race attacks and all this turn out to be fake.
[00:23:53.763 --> 00:23:56.665]  But the Democrats keep doing it because it creates the victimology.
[00:23:57.065 --> 00:23:58.526]  Did you hear of the Air Force Academy?
[00:24:00.067 --> 00:24:00.887]  Or West Point?
[00:24:01.348 --> 00:24:10.853]  Or any of these groups the last couple years where people spray paint inward everywhere or right on the vending machines, no inwards allowed, and then it's liberal black students doing it?
[00:24:15.336 --> 00:24:17.517]  That's how you're somebody in the leftist world.
[00:24:18.898 --> 00:24:20.099]  Is you make yourself a victim.
[00:24:21.363 --> 00:24:26.772]  So Empire star Jesse Smollett's story falling apart.
[00:24:26.792 --> 00:24:27.454]  We're going to look at that.
[00:24:27.494 --> 00:24:28.756]  But it just never ends.
[00:24:28.796 --> 00:24:29.076]  It's like...
[00:24:30.305 --> 00:24:33.046]  Trump had to do an early State of the Union because they were saying he was anti-Semitic.
[00:24:33.426 --> 00:24:38.947]  Because he said, well, I hear this was probably staged by somebody to blame conservatives.
[00:24:39.287 --> 00:24:44.608]  Because why would conservatives be in New Jersey tumping over Jewish headstones and spray painting swastikas on synagogues?
[00:24:44.628 --> 00:24:47.449]  And it was a leftist Jew blaming Trump for it!
[00:24:47.489 --> 00:24:48.229]  And Trump was right!
[00:24:48.869 --> 00:24:55.150]  It barely got any coverage even in local New Jersey news.
[00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:59.311]  99% of the time, folks, these attacks are staged.
[00:25:01.357 --> 00:25:04.681]  So we'll get to that, but let me get to this first.
[00:25:07.043 --> 00:25:08.064]  Let me get to this first.
[00:25:09.666 --> 00:25:11.528]  Because we saw Peto O'Rourke.
[00:25:11.968 --> 00:25:13.350]  I'm sorry, Beto O'Rourke.
[00:25:15.034 --> 00:25:19.398]  Says that walls in lives are immoral and evil, while he's behind a wall and police guarding him.
[00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:20.739]  We showed that yesterday.
[00:25:20.759 --> 00:25:22.121]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:25:22.141 --> 00:25:31.790]  But now, Senator, Democrat Senator Bob Menendez, who got indicted for underage girls and all this stuff, and got found not guilty by the swamp jury,
[00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:38.433]  The point is, he is flying and having sex with underage girls, so I guess he doesn't know what a crime is.
[00:25:39.034 --> 00:25:42.656]  He attacks Trump for classifying drunk driving illegals as criminal.
[00:25:43.377 --> 00:25:45.098]  A, you're an illegal alien, you're here illegally.
[00:25:45.658 --> 00:25:51.362]  When you fly down to Puerto Vallarta or Cancun, they say, what hotel are you staying at?
[00:25:54.024 --> 00:26:02.069]  And you tell them, and then you check off a card, and then, a lot of the times, they call the hotel and check, and when you get there, just like Interpol, they take your
[00:26:03.544 --> 00:26:04.525]  Passport, they scan it.
[00:26:05.745 --> 00:26:07.266]  They run you for any criminal warrants.
[00:26:08.227 --> 00:26:10.988]  You're being totally watched in Mexico, and then you go to your hotel room.
[00:26:13.449 --> 00:26:16.591]  They're saying people with diseases, you name it, don't even get tested.
[00:26:16.611 --> 00:26:18.412]  You're just, you're just, you're in the country.
[00:26:18.432 --> 00:26:21.014]  So you're already here committing a felony.
[00:26:22.915 --> 00:26:26.957]  Oh, by the way, I've got friends and people I know, they're like, oh, Cancun's so great.
[00:26:26.977 --> 00:26:30.499]  Or Isla Mujeres is so great, or any of those places.
[00:26:32.398 --> 00:26:34.979]  I've been going to Cancun since there were like 10 hotels, now there's like 500.
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.341]  And you stay a day or two.
[00:26:39.381 --> 00:26:40.322]  They start calling the hotel.
[00:26:40.882 --> 00:26:42.163]  They're like, senor, please come down.
[00:26:42.183 --> 00:26:44.104]  There's like security waiting at the hotel.
[00:26:44.724 --> 00:26:48.326]  Like, your flight was supposed to be yesterday, southwest, back to Dallas.
[00:26:49.066 --> 00:26:52.108]  People are like, oh, well, I thought we said, we need to talk to you now.
[00:26:52.388 --> 00:26:53.088]  No, now!
[00:26:53.468 --> 00:27:00.892]  And they run you into a room and say, and then like, we're going to give you a $2,000 fine, and you're on the next plane out of here.
[00:27:02.844 --> 00:27:07.085]  But we're like, oh, you got diseases, everything, just come on in, do whatever you want.
[00:27:07.205 --> 00:27:08.125]  This is crazy.
[00:27:08.365 --> 00:27:11.946]  And now Mexico has allowed them to break the southern border completely.
[00:27:12.426 --> 00:27:22.688]  And then Menendez, he's not the Dominican Republic, the 15-year-old girls, he is now up here saying to say that someone, already or illegally, who's arrested drunk driving, they're not a criminal.
[00:27:23.428 --> 00:27:24.688]  This is the upside-down world.
[00:27:24.728 --> 00:27:28.049]  New York just said you can stab a baby to death, and it's not a crime.
[00:27:28.609 --> 00:27:29.169]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:27:29.189 --> 00:27:29.509]  Here it is.
[00:27:31.843 --> 00:27:40.314]  Zero tolerance policy that has turned everyone, regardless of their record, into a criminal.
[00:27:40.354 --> 00:27:46.182]  For example, if you cross the border undocumented, he has now made you a criminal.
[00:27:46.823 --> 00:27:51.126]  He is creating that problem by turning people away who legitimately seek asylum.
[00:27:51.246 --> 00:27:59.051]  If a person has a driving while under the influence violation, he is now making that, saying that that's a criminal.
[00:27:59.691 --> 00:28:09.138]  What we have seen in the past under, for example, President Obama, that violent criminals, yes, we want to see those persons not only arrested and detained... No, that's a total lie.
[00:28:09.198 --> 00:28:12.820]  San Francisco, the alien, shoots the woman in the back.
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:13.681]  Shut it off, please.
[00:28:14.561 --> 00:28:17.642]  An illegal alien shoots the woman in the back, and it's not a problem.
[00:28:17.982 --> 00:28:18.322]  Kills her.
[00:28:18.342 --> 00:28:19.482]  They're like, look, you go free.
[00:28:20.083 --> 00:28:21.863]  So the guy's a total lying fraud.
[00:28:21.923 --> 00:28:27.124]  Obama let tens of thousands of children across, unaccompanied, into the U.S.
[00:28:27.145 --> 00:28:28.445]  who were put into sex slavery.
[00:28:28.865 --> 00:28:34.226]  Which I'm sure Bob Menendez absolutely loves, because if he didn't look like a pedophile, Brian Stelter doesn't either.
[00:28:35.147 --> 00:28:36.647]  Not saying Brian Stelter's a pedophile.
[00:28:37.087 --> 00:28:39.848]  Saying he looks like something that would scare the hell out of me in a dark alley.
[00:28:41.476 --> 00:28:46.538]  But Bob Menendez narrowly escaped all his pedophilia by the swamp jury not convicting him.
[00:28:47.138 --> 00:28:49.539]  But he looks like a big ol' Bob Big Boy, man.
[00:28:50.019 --> 00:28:52.640]  You can imagine those portable girls in those slave dungeons.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.981]  Here comes Bob Menendez into the room, toddling forward.
[00:28:56.622 --> 00:28:57.102]  Stay with us.
[00:29:03.064 --> 00:29:04.745]  It took us over a year to develop it.
[00:29:05.505 --> 00:29:07.486]  Thousands and thousands of five-star reviews.
[00:29:08.587 --> 00:29:09.588]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[00:29:09.888 --> 00:29:14.912]  I'm so proud of you and the InfoWars team for all that you do.
[00:29:15.032 --> 00:29:16.653]  I wanted to say I love your product.
[00:29:16.873 --> 00:29:19.195]  The Brain Force Plus is amazing.
[00:29:19.215 --> 00:29:24.479]  Me and my family take it every day and I mean you really can feel what it does.
[00:29:24.499 --> 00:29:32.745]  We were able to develop Brain Force because we went out and looked at what the best-selling nootropics or brain focus energy products were.
[00:29:33.385 --> 00:29:35.166]  And we decided to make it even stronger
[00:29:36.147 --> 00:29:39.968]  And even more high quality and even more organic than leading competitors.
[00:29:40.488 --> 00:29:42.389]  And we've done it with Brain Force Plus.
[00:29:42.449 --> 00:29:46.550]  It is our number one bestseller in gross bottles sold.
[00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:51.832]  Now I made the decision in our marketing to put a lot of product in it and sell it for a low price.
[00:29:52.492 --> 00:29:59.874]  Believing that you're smart, you'll research the market, get a great result, know you're getting a great deal, and be routine, continued customers.
[00:30:00.294 --> 00:30:03.834]  I want a long-term relationship with you, and I want a product that I'm proud of that I'm going to use.
[00:30:04.254 --> 00:30:05.635]  It's up there as the very best.
[00:30:05.815 --> 00:30:08.455]  There are nootropics that are $80 a bottle that aren't as good.
[00:30:08.795 --> 00:30:09.916]  They have some dissimilar ingredients.
[00:30:10.576 --> 00:30:13.536]  But, you know, a doctor sells it at their office, so it must be better.
[00:30:14.677 --> 00:30:21.278]  Ladies and gentlemen, we then stood back and said, what is the number one best-selling thing in the total market globally?
[00:30:22.295 --> 00:30:22.475]  I don't
[00:30:42.759 --> 00:30:48.821]  Top people in the country who has developed some of the other top energy drinks in the nation and in the world.
[00:30:49.221 --> 00:30:53.003]  And they developed TurboForce that is the next level.
[00:30:53.523 --> 00:30:54.463]  Long burn.
[00:30:54.483 --> 00:30:56.684]  A lot of folks up to 10 hours of energy.
[00:30:57.324 --> 00:30:57.804]  Me, 6, 7, 8 hours.
[00:30:58.164 --> 00:30:59.185]  And I take about a half a packet.
[00:30:59.205 --> 00:30:59.725]  It's so strong.
[00:31:00.065 --> 00:31:05.647]  And then it's got all the minerals and all the different amino acids that help deliver the energy into the body.
[00:31:06.397 --> 00:31:20.227]  And that's why I want to thank all the listeners who've been BrainForce fans with 50% off BrainForce, because the two go together to supply yourself and your family with your nootropic with TurboForce, ladies and gentlemen, so you can try it.
[00:31:20.628 --> 00:31:27.453]  It's 33% off, and you get it in a combo, 50% off on BrainForce for a limited time at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:31:27.933 --> 00:31:30.535]  One is a pill, one is a packet.
[00:31:31.015 --> 00:31:35.359]  And again, the first time you take TurboForce, I recommend you only take half a packet, because let me tell you,
[00:31:36.354 --> 00:31:39.779]  Folks I know that are totally into energy drinks said they've never seen anything like it.
[00:31:40.139 --> 00:31:41.701]  Most energy drinks hit in 20-30 minutes.
[00:31:42.242 --> 00:31:45.827]  A lot of people get hit in 5 minutes with turbo force.
[00:31:46.288 --> 00:31:51.214]  But again, it doesn't just hit fast, it lasts super, super long because the developers
[00:31:52.315 --> 00:32:00.099]  That we reached out to had the mission of having something that gives you continual clean energy over a long period of time.
[00:32:00.459 --> 00:32:05.661]  So the different compounds that are in this, that synergistically work together, have different burn rates.
[00:32:06.221 --> 00:32:09.583]  Almost like a Saturn rocket's got three different components.
[00:32:11.104 --> 00:32:11.545]  See what I mean?
[00:32:11.805 --> 00:32:19.757]  It launches, you get the main boost phase, then you get up into orbit, get your next phase, get to the moon, land on the moon, come back to the Earth.
[00:32:20.138 --> 00:32:23.923]  You've got all those different phases here, ladies and gentlemen, to get you throughout the day.
[00:32:24.364 --> 00:32:25.185]  Boost in the morning!
[00:32:26.124 --> 00:32:31.325]  Continue on through your interstellar day, conquering, exploring, dominating.
[00:32:32.025 --> 00:32:34.186]  And listen, I like to ride my horse and shoot my gun.
[00:32:34.306 --> 00:32:37.187]  You know, a country boy's work is really never done.
[00:32:37.207 --> 00:32:44.828]  And after you put the kids down to bed with the missus there in your arms, you can do a repair job and fix the cable like all good Americans do.
[00:32:45.368 --> 00:32:46.349]  And all thanks to Turbo Force.
[00:32:47.069 --> 00:32:51.630]  So again, coming to you, ladies and gentlemen, from the founding system,
[00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:56.672]  Of Turbo Force and Rain Force, I bring you this incredible product at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:32:56.892 --> 00:32:58.393]  Get the energy combo today.
[00:32:58.673 --> 00:33:00.213]  Oh, and fund the InfoWars and change the world.
[00:33:00.413 --> 00:33:01.234]  I forgot about that part, too.
[00:33:07.056 --> 00:33:09.717]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:17.953 --> 00:33:19.534]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:20.034 --> 00:33:22.815]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:36.822]  This is my theme song, folks, and I'm in it to win it with you.
[00:33:37.562 --> 00:33:38.423]  Totally committed.
[00:33:39.523 --> 00:33:42.204]  Absolutely love it, but I don't want to lose.
[00:33:42.385 --> 00:33:42.905]  That means, hey,
[00:33:44.477 --> 00:33:46.298]  I personally don't want to be wiped out by the globalists.
[00:33:46.799 --> 00:33:48.000]  We're already winning the war.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.882]  If I gotta lose the battle myself, I'm ready to do it.
[00:33:51.883 --> 00:33:53.504]  But I do want to swing for the fences.
[00:33:54.164 --> 00:34:01.710]  When you pray for us, when you spread the word about the show, when you financially buy great products that you already need to 360 win, without you, we wouldn't be here.
[00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:07.174]  You know, we've got just some insane things to cover here.
[00:34:10.957 --> 00:34:13.539]  My problem is, I have too much amazing news.
[00:34:15.822 --> 00:34:17.123]  Don't stop at the top.
[00:34:21.785 --> 00:34:23.105]  I want the listeners to understand.
[00:34:24.266 --> 00:34:40.773]  The globalists believe that two individuals, in their own admissions, in their own white papers, in their own secret reports, that two people were the catalyst to boost Trump into office.
[00:34:41.533 --> 00:34:45.135]  Their names are Matt Grudge and Alex Jones.
[00:34:46.903 --> 00:34:48.303]  Now that's not bragging to say that.
[00:34:49.904 --> 00:34:52.304]  The globalists were able to track that and that's true.
[00:34:53.285 --> 00:34:59.746]  And you notice my brand of nationalism and anti-globalism is now the brand of the globe.
[00:35:01.787 --> 00:35:03.847]  And the globalists themselves are backtracking.
[00:35:04.748 --> 00:35:07.608]  So we've won devastating victories.
[00:35:09.529 --> 00:35:10.329]  Devastating
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:15.441]  There's a Guardian, how Drudge report ushered in the age of Trump.
[00:35:16.381 --> 00:35:23.464]  So when I sit there and I talk about that, it's not about going, oh hey, I just won the Indianapolis whatever, or oh I just won the football game.
[00:35:23.484 --> 00:35:25.985]  I'm not somebody spiking a football in the end zone.
[00:35:27.425 --> 00:35:28.385]  I am under siege.
[00:35:31.206 --> 00:35:32.147]  Use the Vietnam analogy.
[00:35:32.167 --> 00:35:33.027]  We're like a firebase.
[00:35:34.417 --> 00:35:40.663]  A square or a big triangle base, they're both sizes, out in enemy territory, surrounded with rockets landing and blowing up.
[00:35:40.723 --> 00:35:42.425]  And we've had major victories.
[00:35:42.465 --> 00:35:44.106]  We've devastated enemy offensives.
[00:35:44.827 --> 00:35:51.874]  But if you don't fly over in C-130s and dump the support to us, we're done.
[00:35:51.894 --> 00:35:54.296]  So I'm going to get to a bunch of news here in just a moment.
[00:35:56.058 --> 00:35:58.040]  But right now, let me just boil it down and codify it.
[00:35:59.212 --> 00:36:02.853]  We sell products because they took our sponsors away over the years.
[00:36:02.873 --> 00:36:03.613]  They harassed us.
[00:36:04.053 --> 00:36:04.654]  They did all of it.
[00:36:04.674 --> 00:36:05.854]  They tried to take our bank accounts away.
[00:36:05.894 --> 00:36:12.116]  So I said, hey, it's best just to control product to make sure it's the best and to sell it to people and have them have a great response.
[00:36:12.156 --> 00:36:14.217]  And they become customers, not just listeners.
[00:36:14.297 --> 00:36:15.697]  And then it's a symbiotic relationship.
[00:36:17.258 --> 00:36:19.938]  And earlier I talked about, you know, why do you go to a globalist hotel?
[00:36:20.038 --> 00:36:22.159]  Why do we, why do we go to the NFL?
[00:36:22.219 --> 00:36:23.239]  Why do we watch Hollywood movies?
[00:36:23.539 --> 00:36:24.760]  More and more, you're not doing it.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.080]  It's why they're down 35, 40%.
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.201]  They're going bankrupt just because you've pulled back.
[00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:34.541]  And all these fits we're seeing are their attempt to dominate us back under their control.
[00:36:35.421 --> 00:36:36.182]  That's what all this is.
[00:36:38.903 --> 00:36:55.289]  So, we produce and go to the top companies and make the best fish oil, or the best nootropic, or the best pre-workout total energy like TurboForce, which the sale, by the way, ends this week for 50% off on RainForce, 33% off on TurboForce when you get them together.
[00:36:56.564 --> 00:37:20.406]  But it's so fundamental that literally, if just a fraction more of this audience, despite all the attacks, and the demonization, and the boycotts, and the harassment, and the fake lawsuits, if you just commit to say, hey, I'm going to get my coffee from InfoWareStore.com and sign up for AutoShip, an additional 10% off, or I'm going to sign up every month to get the Coil Silver Iodine Fortified Fluoride Free Toothpaste Super Blue.
[00:37:22.082 --> 00:37:27.184]  If you just do that, it literally buys war bonds against these people, and we can defeat them.
[00:37:28.145 --> 00:37:42.891]  Now, I'm so excited about this, because they taste so good, they're so great, they're such high quality, and I can't wait to hear them try to demonize that we're selling high quality infused protein bars.
[00:37:43.952 --> 00:37:48.474]  We went to, again, three of the top manufacturers in the country,
[00:37:49.963 --> 00:37:55.725]  We said we want to up the protein level, up the quality, even though you're already top of the line, and we're going to lower the price.
[00:37:56.326 --> 00:38:02.788]  Because the average protein bar is cost in these places $1 to produce or less, and they're selling the high-end ones for $6, $7 at Whole Foods.
[00:38:03.328 --> 00:38:09.311]  So this is a high-end protein bar, InfoWars Live Protein Bar, two different flavors.
[00:38:11.392 --> 00:38:13.872]  At regular price in the packs of 12, it's $3.
[00:38:14.493 --> 00:38:17.354]  15 grams of protein and so much more.
[00:38:18.885 --> 00:38:21.106]  These are super high quality, no fillers, nothing.
[00:38:25.049 --> 00:38:32.133]  But under the discount we've got going, it's 40% off when you get two boxes, instead of 25% off, it's like $2.40.
[00:38:33.714 --> 00:38:37.676]  I want you to, everybody's like running around the office since these came in about two weeks ago.
[00:38:38.057 --> 00:38:40.738]  We're launching them today and they're like, this is the best protein bar I've ever tasted.
[00:38:40.778 --> 00:38:41.499]  Why is it so good?
[00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:45.681]  And I said, because I can already go to the top people and I say, let's go up even more.
[00:38:46.522 --> 00:38:48.203]  I don't need five or seven times markup.
[00:38:49.116 --> 00:38:51.744]  At regular sales price, there's a 200% markup.
[00:38:51.804 --> 00:38:52.486]  We discount it.
[00:38:52.827 --> 00:38:53.268]  It's like a 100% markup.
[00:38:53.288 --> 00:38:53.489]  Or I guess 40%.
[00:38:53.569 --> 00:38:54.612]  It's like a 120% markup.
[00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:55.374]  Whatever comes out to it.
[00:38:58.524 --> 00:39:00.985]  I personally like vanilla coconut.
[00:39:01.025 --> 00:39:01.805]  I love coconut.
[00:39:01.825 --> 00:39:03.465]  There was all these flavored options we had.
[00:39:03.506 --> 00:39:04.546]  I love vanilla and coconut together.
[00:39:04.566 --> 00:39:07.727]  It's one of my favorite pies, one of my favorite cakes.
[00:39:07.787 --> 00:39:09.167]  It's so good, it'll blow you away.
[00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:11.048]  Meal replacement, you name it, on the go.
[00:39:11.728 --> 00:39:12.568]  This is next level.
[00:39:12.948 --> 00:39:14.369]  And then a lot of people like chocolate.
[00:39:14.549 --> 00:39:15.169]  I like chocolate.
[00:39:15.189 --> 00:39:16.869]  I don't like it with peanut butter so much.
[00:39:16.889 --> 00:39:17.850]  I mean, it's okay.
[00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:19.430]  I like Reese's Pieces, but it's not my favorite.
[00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:20.851]  But this is really good.
[00:39:21.311 --> 00:39:22.391]  I'm not trying to put the product down.
[00:39:22.411 --> 00:39:23.711]  It's just my favorite is the vanilla coconut.
[00:39:24.052 --> 00:39:25.232]  Peanut butter chocolate.
[00:39:26.681 --> 00:39:27.902]  12-pack, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:27.982 --> 00:39:30.525]  It comes down to the discount of $2.40 a bar.
[00:39:31.546 --> 00:39:35.050]  Competing bars are $5, $6, $7 a piece of this quality.
[00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:36.651]  No fillers, no nothing.
[00:39:37.072 --> 00:39:38.554]  It's what I give to my family.
[00:39:39.675 --> 00:39:40.876]  We have a lot of protein bars at the house.
[00:39:41.156 --> 00:39:41.697]  High-end ones.
[00:39:41.977 --> 00:39:42.918]  They're all gone now.
[00:39:43.098 --> 00:39:45.521]  My kids love these in the last two weeks since they were there.
[00:39:45.601 --> 00:39:47.963]  They absolutely can't believe how good they are.
[00:39:48.806 --> 00:39:52.508]  So InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and shopping with the good guys.
[00:39:52.828 --> 00:39:59.052]  If you'll just buy your coffee, your toothpaste, things that you need to order every month, and your protein bars.
[00:39:59.712 --> 00:40:01.493]  If you'll just do those staples with us.
[00:40:01.513 --> 00:40:02.653]  You know, we're so evil.
[00:40:02.734 --> 00:40:05.435]  Toothpaste, and coffee, and high quality.
[00:40:06.295 --> 00:40:08.357]  I'm sure there'll be a lot of Washington Post headlines.
[00:40:08.377 --> 00:40:10.638]  They won't say, hey, we're the biggest supplement sellers in the world.
[00:40:11.218 --> 00:40:18.250]  He sells coffee and toothpaste, brushing your teeth is bad, and he sells pure, clean protein bars that taste incredibly good.
[00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:19.793]  They taste like candy bars!
[00:40:20.474 --> 00:40:21.916]  They taste better than candy bars!
[00:40:21.936 --> 00:40:24.280]  Your body's like, this is what I want, this is what I need!
[00:40:25.748 --> 00:40:31.832]  So your long haul truck driver, or your teacher, or your police officer, or in the military, send them to your family in the military.
[00:40:32.172 --> 00:40:33.773]  Give a box to firefighters.
[00:40:34.314 --> 00:40:36.095]  This is how you fund the InfoWars.
[00:40:36.475 --> 00:40:47.082]  Instead of going and paying more for bars that aren't even as good in many cases, at Whole Foods or wherever, you get the highest quality, you get a discount, and you fund the resistance.
[00:40:47.362 --> 00:40:49.183]  It's a total 360 win.
[00:40:49.844 --> 00:40:52.225]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:40:52.826 --> 00:40:54.087]  We've got two different types.
[00:40:55.171 --> 00:40:56.151]  I'm very proud of this.
[00:40:56.211 --> 00:40:58.372]  It took a long time to do this because we wanted the very best.
[00:40:58.833 --> 00:41:00.693]  We rejected so many different permutations.
[00:41:01.034 --> 00:41:02.714]  We did focus groups for the first time ever.
[00:41:02.734 --> 00:41:05.175]  I mean, this is what everybody said was their favorite.
[00:41:05.436 --> 00:41:07.637]  Tastes great, super healthy, super amazing.
[00:41:08.197 --> 00:41:13.899]  Get your InfoWars Life Protein Bars today at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:41:13.979 --> 00:41:15.600]  And thank you for your support.
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:20.522]  Now, I am plugging more than I used to.
[00:41:20.562 --> 00:41:21.643]  Remember back in the old days?
[00:41:22.551 --> 00:41:25.666]  If we were deplatformed everywhere, I'd plug once an hour for like a minute.
[00:41:26.564 --> 00:41:34.209]  And that was because, um, the audience was so huge and it's still giant, but they have cut us down to the core, you know, 300 or whatever.
[00:41:34.229 --> 00:41:34.830]  You know what I mean?
[00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:39.232]  In those hardcore, the most focused and in ways there's huge viral videos that happen and things.
[00:41:39.573 --> 00:41:42.955]  I mean, the legend of info wars is bigger than ever, but that isn't what matters.
[00:41:43.095 --> 00:41:46.117]  I want to reach people at point blank range to wake them up.
[00:41:46.217 --> 00:41:52.181]  The globalists are scared of me talking to somebody because they know people instinctively go, this guy's telling the truth.
[00:41:52.441 --> 00:41:53.322]  This guy's for real.
[00:41:53.622 --> 00:41:55.023]  This guy is in it to win it.
[00:41:55.383 --> 00:41:56.024]  I'm on your side.
[00:41:56.144 --> 00:41:56.424]  I am.
[00:41:57.064 --> 00:41:58.625]  And, you know, I'm not bragging about it.
[00:41:58.885 --> 00:42:00.266]  They tried to hire me at Fox.
[00:42:00.786 --> 00:42:03.188]  They tried to hire me at Clear Channel and much other places.
[00:42:03.528 --> 00:42:05.689]  They sent in top TV executives three different times.
[00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:09.591]  You know, Roger Ailes, before he died, wanted to launch something new, but he was too sick to do it.
[00:42:10.332 --> 00:42:14.054]  And they just said, listen, you got the highest Q scores we've ever seen.
[00:42:15.205 --> 00:42:16.806]  You know, better than Bill Hemmer or whatever.
[00:42:16.826 --> 00:42:18.106]  That guy supposedly has them off the charts.
[00:42:18.707 --> 00:42:22.628]  And they just said, we're ready, we want to do it, but you need to do what we say.
[00:42:22.648 --> 00:42:23.429]  I never did it.
[00:42:23.609 --> 00:42:24.629]  And I'm not saying I'm that great.
[00:42:24.649 --> 00:42:25.990]  I don't know why I have those IQ scores.
[00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:30.212]  But I legitimately, well I do, I legitimately believe in you.
[00:42:30.612 --> 00:42:31.332]  I believe in me.
[00:42:31.753 --> 00:42:33.373]  I believe we're in this together and I want to win.
[00:42:34.614 --> 00:42:38.676]  But without your hope, and without your prayer, and without your financial support, getting the right products you need,
[00:42:40.114 --> 00:42:40.595]  They're gonna win.
[00:42:41.355 --> 00:42:42.156]  I'm gonna go down swinging.
[00:42:42.637 --> 00:42:54.290]  But my God, you get great toothpaste, you get great coffee, you get great bars, protein bars, and then you fund people that are willing to go all the way to the wall, all the way to death.
[00:42:56.253 --> 00:42:56.713]  It's simple.
[00:42:56.793 --> 00:42:58.335]  Infowarsstore.com, thanks for your support.
[00:42:58.415 --> 00:42:59.657]  We'll hit the big news on the other side.

[00:46:59.623 --> 00:47:00.903]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:15.211 --> 00:47:15.892]  Big Brother.
[00:47:16.332 --> 00:47:17.573]  Mainstream media.
[00:47:18.134 --> 00:47:19.175]  Government cover-ups.
[00:47:20.035 --> 00:47:21.477]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:47:21.717 --> 00:47:22.898]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:23.398 --> 00:47:28.423]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:53.851 --> 00:48:08.656]  You know, I like Roger as a friend, but he doles out exclusives to like, you know, some to Fox News, some to Daily Caller, and he works here.
[00:48:09.696 --> 00:48:10.516]  I pay his salary.
[00:48:11.616 --> 00:48:13.457]  And I've been checking both my phones here.
[00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:17.832]  Jack Posobiec called us for comment on this like 10 minutes ago.
[00:48:22.115 --> 00:48:24.677]  So I guess Roger Stone's gonna go to the woodshed here pretty soon.
[00:48:26.258 --> 00:48:29.861]  Roger Stone has filed lawsuit against Robert Mueller.
[00:48:32.623 --> 00:48:33.283]  Which he should.
[00:48:33.424 --> 00:48:35.845]  CNN clearly is there being coordinated by the FBI.
[00:48:36.266 --> 00:48:39.888]  He has the screenshots where the CNN screwed up and said, comment on your indictment.
[00:48:41.009 --> 00:48:42.150]  Which the idiot reporters.
[00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:44.472]  One thing about these traitors is they are stupid.
[00:48:45.509 --> 00:48:46.829]  They sent him the day before.
[00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:48.210]  He didn't really know what to do with it.
[00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:49.050]  He saw it the next day.
[00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:50.330]  Hey, you've been indicted.
[00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:53.011]  What do you make of this for the grand jury even building?
[00:48:56.111 --> 00:48:57.332]  So that's incredible.
[00:48:57.552 --> 00:49:00.912]  So this is not being picked up yet.
[00:49:01.892 --> 00:49:07.134]  This is a global exclusive in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.
[00:49:07.154 --> 00:49:08.894]  Filed today.
[00:49:09.434 --> 00:49:13.395]  Roger Stone's motion requesting a show cause order.
[00:49:16.912 --> 00:49:17.973]  So it's on Gateway Pundit.
[00:49:18.653 --> 00:49:19.213]  Well, that's good.
[00:49:20.154 --> 00:49:22.876]  Gateway Pundit can hire Roger, which I think Rainey Pruitt does a great job.
[00:49:22.896 --> 00:49:26.298]  In fact, Roger Stone now works for the Gateway Pundit, which is good.
[00:49:26.838 --> 00:49:27.519]  I like the work they do.
[00:49:27.539 --> 00:49:28.219]  They're very prolific.
[00:49:28.659 --> 00:49:29.460]  They're bulldogs.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.000]  I really like them.
[00:49:31.281 --> 00:49:34.263]  So there you go here at the InfoWars Command Center.
[00:49:35.504 --> 00:49:37.285]  Roger Stone has been charged with Congress.
[00:49:37.325 --> 00:49:40.547]  It goes on from there about how they staged the whole deal, which is a great point.
[00:49:41.691 --> 00:49:44.634]  And, you know, show the cause of how you trampled his rights to do this.
[00:49:45.354 --> 00:49:48.477]  So there you go, and there is the document right there.
[00:49:48.757 --> 00:49:52.500]  You know, people call us to find out what Roger's up to, and I just, I can't tell you.
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:53.120]  I don't know.
[00:49:54.542 --> 00:49:57.924]  So, Roger Stone now works for the Gateway Pundit, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:58.865 --> 00:50:00.847]  Seriously, as of about 10 seconds ago.
[00:50:01.507 --> 00:50:08.072]  I'm like, Roger, get a job with the Gateway Pundit now, because... Here, let me check my other phone.
[00:50:08.613 --> 00:50:09.674]  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
[00:50:10.316 --> 00:50:14.019]  Maybe he called this other phone and gave me the exclusive.
[00:50:15.119 --> 00:50:16.140]  Nope, doesn't look like it.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.941]  Hey guys, this plug isn't working in here.
[00:50:17.961 --> 00:50:20.103]  Can you guys get this phone and plug it in for me?
[00:50:20.783 --> 00:50:23.245]  God almighty, what a mess around here, boy, I gotta tell you.
[00:50:24.005 --> 00:50:28.569]  Alright, let's just move off the Roger Stone news and the whole Russiagate thing coming to its end.
[00:50:29.775 --> 00:50:30.355]  The rest of it.
[00:50:30.855 --> 00:50:32.996]  No indictments of anybody with Russia.
[00:50:33.456 --> 00:50:35.617]  Senate Intelligence Committee, no Russian connections, of course.
[00:50:35.998 --> 00:50:41.580]  But they're about... You've got this big lawyer for Trump saying, oh, I bet Mueller doesn't even put out a report or make a statement.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.781]  That's because Congress is going to keep the Russiagate fake thing going.
[00:50:45.341 --> 00:50:48.663]  As Schiff has said in the House Judiciary Committee.
[00:50:51.104 --> 00:50:52.084]  That's what's going on there.
[00:50:56.118 --> 00:51:15.486]  Because then he just kind of, the fact that there was no rushing, he just kind of, oh, it's the, it's the vehicle, rushing against the vehicle to illegally spy, and the vehicle discredit the election, and it's the vehicle, it's the delivery system to get the dragnet of dirt on Trump associates for income taxes, you name it, to now get to that point.
[00:51:17.846 --> 00:51:20.327]  And so, that's where all this is going.
[00:51:23.369 --> 00:51:24.049]  Now let me do this.
[00:51:26.383 --> 00:51:29.045]  I said I'd get to it this segment, but I just got derailed by that.
[00:51:32.128 --> 00:51:36.471]  I know what's going on with Howard Schultz, and it's as plain as the nose on Anitra Bunny's face.
[00:51:37.272 --> 00:51:38.473]  So we're going to be looking at that.
[00:51:39.634 --> 00:51:42.356]  Bloomberg's $500 million anti-Trump moonshot.
[00:51:44.178 --> 00:51:47.380]  We're going to tie that in with nobody deserves to be this rich, Bill Gates.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:48.341]  What's that really mean?
[00:51:50.063 --> 00:51:50.963]  That's all coming up.
[00:51:53.245 --> 00:51:54.907]  So we'll be breaking it down.
[00:51:56.522 --> 00:51:58.944]  Oh, more Californians consider fleeing the state.
[00:51:59.004 --> 00:52:04.588]  That's all the start of the next hour.
[00:52:05.769 --> 00:52:08.131]  We're going to get to all of it here today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:10.593 --> 00:52:12.655]  And we're also going to get into
[00:52:16.124 --> 00:52:23.808]  This whole stack of news about George Soros admitting that the EU is on the verge of collapsing and panicking, that their whole world government's in trouble.
[00:52:24.088 --> 00:52:24.688]  Just remember that.
[00:52:24.728 --> 00:52:27.569]  We've just got to hold the line as patriots a few more years.
[00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:31.991]  The left's uncloaking and saying we want to kill babies after they're born.
[00:52:32.051 --> 00:52:33.112]  We love devil worship.
[00:52:33.868 --> 00:52:34.748]  We hate America.
[00:52:34.768 --> 00:52:35.949]  I've got articles here.
[00:52:35.989 --> 00:52:37.869]  We want to ban the American flag.
[00:52:37.889 --> 00:52:42.070]  And we want to change George Washington University because he's a bad person.
[00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:44.491]  And we want everything free.
[00:52:44.511 --> 00:52:46.211]  And you don't have to work if you don't want to.
[00:52:46.872 --> 00:52:48.252]  That's their death throes.
[00:52:48.292 --> 00:52:50.653]  That's their political floundering.
[00:52:53.013 --> 00:52:53.613]  That's going on.
[00:52:55.214 --> 00:52:56.114]  That's all that's happening.
[00:52:57.134 --> 00:52:57.434]  Period.
[00:52:58.915 --> 00:52:59.235]  And so
[00:53:00.711 --> 00:53:17.197]  We have to understand that don't give in to their death throes, don't give in to their temper tantrum, spread the word word of mouth, spread the word via text message, via email, call and talk radio, call in the C-SPAN, do satirical things on Facebook and Twitter, because the left is so brain damaged and so mentally ill.
[00:53:18.737 --> 00:53:23.079]  Mark Dice, which we'll play next segment, he put out a satirical video
[00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:34.891]  Which was clear, saying, oh my gosh, since her thing is so kooky, saying ban airplanes and ban cows farting and kill all cows and Cory Booker right now saying ban all meat.
[00:53:36.212 --> 00:53:43.614]  Since it's so crazy, let's say everyone must collect their urine to make coffee at the office and a free massage chair.
[00:53:43.794 --> 00:53:44.154]  Why not?
[00:53:44.194 --> 00:53:45.375]  Saying everything's free, I don't have to work.
[00:53:46.135 --> 00:53:47.796]  He said it was satire and a joke.
[00:53:48.177 --> 00:53:49.858]  Let's see if they endorse this.
[00:53:50.398 --> 00:53:56.983]  They all went, oh, Cortez didn't put this on her website, and then used this as an example, not what she actually put that was just as ridiculous.
[00:53:58.705 --> 00:54:03.448]  But a lot of leftists saw it and actually endorsed it, thinking, yeah, I want a massage chair.
[00:54:03.929 --> 00:54:05.410]  It's like they're autistic or something.
[00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:06.731]  I don't mean that meanly.
[00:54:06.771 --> 00:54:08.552]  It's like they don't get humor.
[00:54:09.733 --> 00:54:11.294]  They don't understand humor.
[00:54:11.354 --> 00:54:12.175]  They don't get it.
[00:54:12.996 --> 00:54:15.918]  Like, I'm going to play a clip coming up next hour of Joe Rogan.
[00:54:17.489 --> 00:54:22.393]  That according to the leftist yardstick, he should be banned from everything on the planet.
[00:54:22.714 --> 00:54:31.982]  And even though I'm mad at Joe, and even though he's gone along with the establishment against me, when I play this clip that is shocking in the current lens, it's humor.
[00:54:32.462 --> 00:54:40.409]  You know, it's humor I wouldn't engage in, but it's covered under the First Amendment.
[00:54:41.755 --> 00:54:45.177]  I'm not endorsing what he said, but I don't think he should be de-platformed for it.
[00:54:45.477 --> 00:54:49.438]  But he's like, oh, de-platform Alex, you know, a few months ago, a few weeks ago.
[00:54:50.219 --> 00:54:53.700]  You know, because he did this horrible thing questioning big, giant media events.
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:54.721]  Oh God, we should never question that.
[00:54:55.041 --> 00:54:56.381]  Now he's backed off that, which is great.
[00:54:57.202 --> 00:54:58.562]  But then I start thinking, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:54:58.862 --> 00:55:02.724]  There's clips of Joe saying things that I won't even repeat.
[00:55:02.744 --> 00:55:03.585]  I'm going to play the clip.
[00:55:03.605 --> 00:55:04.985]  Because they'll say I said it.
[00:55:05.565 --> 00:55:06.606]  That's how deceptive the media is.
[00:55:08.217 --> 00:55:24.728]  But oh, I bet, because if you can go back six years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, 30 years on what somebody did and interpreted however you want and then you platform them, well then imagine.
[00:55:25.879 --> 00:55:37.744]  Is that why Joe's been acting so incredibly compromised down on his knees to Silicon Valley, on his knees to Jack Dorsey, on his knees doing all this.
[00:55:37.764 --> 00:55:40.065]  So that's coming up next hour as well.
[00:55:42.782 --> 00:55:54.686]  And we're going to get into Ted Cruz's plan that's constitutional for asylum forfeiture seizure on the border, that would totally pay for the wall and beyond that, pay for drug rehab and, you know, disease mitigation and testing.
[00:55:55.226 --> 00:55:57.246]  I mean, hell, that's what Ellis Island did was test for diseases.
[00:55:57.346 --> 00:56:02.228]  Great idea of Senator Ted Cruz, probably the smartest guy in the Senate.
[00:56:02.248 --> 00:56:03.888]  I think one of the smartest guys.
[00:56:04.329 --> 00:56:08.650]  I mean, Rand Paul him, it's kind of hard to guess which one's smartest, but they're both real treasures.
[00:56:10.134 --> 00:56:11.955]  And so we'll be looking at all that coming up.
[00:56:12.015 --> 00:56:13.696]  And in this great headline, U.S.
[00:56:13.776 --> 00:56:17.238]  Hungary determined to protect Christianity worldwide.
[00:56:18.039 --> 00:56:18.559]  Worldwide.
[00:56:18.579 --> 00:56:21.381]  Because Christianity's under attack.
[00:56:21.401 --> 00:56:23.862]  The number of Christians being killed every year has doubled.
[00:56:23.882 --> 00:56:24.142]  The U.N.
[00:56:24.162 --> 00:56:24.583]  admits it.
[00:56:25.063 --> 00:56:26.524]  Soros and others are pushing that whole plan.
[00:56:26.544 --> 00:56:27.824]  So it's all coming up.
[00:56:28.225 --> 00:56:29.565]  And open phones next hour.
[00:56:30.006 --> 00:56:30.306]  And then...
[00:56:31.653 --> 00:56:38.639]  Leo Zagami from Rome, on the huge scandals at the Vatican that threaten to bring down the whole New World Order.
[00:56:38.659 --> 00:56:42.982]  Because here's the thing, they use the infiltration of the Vatican with pedophile rings to get control of it.
[00:56:43.002 --> 00:56:44.263]  That's been admitted, even the Guardian.
[00:56:45.064 --> 00:56:45.544]  Well, the Guardian.
[00:56:46.024 --> 00:56:50.148]  But the same networks keep blackmailing, keep controlling, and blackmailing each other.
[00:56:50.428 --> 00:56:51.789]  There's no honor amongst thieves.
[00:56:52.550 --> 00:56:53.891]  So, I'm not anti-Catholic.
[00:56:53.991 --> 00:56:55.112]  I'm not anti-Vatican.
[00:56:56.128 --> 00:56:59.370]  You know, we probably wouldn't have civilization in the West today if the Vatican hadn't come along.
[00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:06.293]  It certainly had its own problems, and the Orthodox Church got its problems, but I think it's a good group of people over, you know, in Eastern Europe and other areas, in Greece.
[00:57:07.173 --> 00:57:15.337]  But regardless, what the Vatican is today is 180 degrees from what the Vatican was 100 years ago.
[00:57:15.437 --> 00:57:21.520]  I mean, it's anti-Christian, anti-Western, anti-child, and that's because the devil cult took it over!
[00:57:22.864 --> 00:57:25.506]  So let's just stop the debate whether it was ever good or ever bad.
[00:57:25.906 --> 00:57:26.886]  It's bad now.
[00:57:28.227 --> 00:57:29.708]  And who's the group the media defends?
[00:57:29.768 --> 00:57:30.548]  The corrupt Vatican.
[00:57:31.149 --> 00:57:31.829]  What do they attack?
[00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:38.233]  Independent, real, orthodox Catholic schools that have good, wholesome people like the Covington kids.
[00:57:38.713 --> 00:57:39.914]  That's who they hate more than anybody.
[00:57:40.754 --> 00:57:43.536]  So, they haven't completed their takeover of Christianity yet.
[00:57:43.936 --> 00:57:44.516]  But they're trying.
[00:57:45.417 --> 00:57:46.017]  Stay with us.
[00:57:46.477 --> 00:57:47.938]  Hour 2 straight ahead.
[00:57:48.418 --> 00:57:50.920]  I'm Alex Jones, the dreaded Info Warrior.
[00:58:02.978 --> 00:58:10.244]  We are offering our best-selling product, BrainForce+, the amazing Nootrobic for focus, energy, intelligence, you name it.
[00:58:10.264 --> 00:58:11.485]  It's just amazing.
[00:58:11.726 --> 00:58:12.526]  It's 50% off.
[00:58:12.546 --> 00:58:13.867]  That is a massive discount.
[00:58:13.887 --> 00:58:18.752]  But I've got to stop this sale, even though it's been very successful, because we're running low on BrainForce+.
[00:58:18.792 --> 00:58:19.692]  Now, it's 50% off.
[00:58:20.373 --> 00:58:23.934]  Coupled in a combo with TurboForce at 33% off.
[00:58:23.974 --> 00:58:25.875]  So the two together are a massive savings.
[00:58:26.015 --> 00:58:28.375]  Now BrainForce is a nootropic for the brain.
[00:58:28.596 --> 00:58:32.757]  And leading competitors are 2-3 times more with similar ingredients.
[00:58:32.817 --> 00:58:36.058]  This is the best ingredients out there at the lowest price.
[00:58:36.858 --> 00:58:38.620]  You couple it with TurboForce.
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:39.981]  I don't even know what to call it.
[00:58:40.061 --> 00:58:40.961]  Is it a pre-workout?
[00:58:41.062 --> 00:58:42.182]  Is it long-lasting energy?
[00:58:42.202 --> 00:58:43.363]  Is it an excellent energy drink?
[00:58:43.403 --> 00:58:44.064]  That's what it all is.
[00:58:44.244 --> 00:58:46.006]  It's healthy, long-lasting energy.
[00:58:46.146 --> 00:58:52.551]  Clean burning with all the different types of naturally occurring energy, with the amino acids, with the vitamins, the minerals, and so much more.
[00:58:52.631 --> 00:58:54.192]  It's TurboForce, comes in packets.
[00:58:54.452 --> 00:58:57.955]  I suggest you only take half a packet the first time you take it.
[00:58:58.075 --> 00:58:59.997]  And if you take it with BrainForce, they go together great.
[00:59:00.037 --> 00:59:02.499]  Just be careful because it's really, really strong.
[00:59:02.619 --> 00:59:06.303]  The great part about it is most people take energy drinks, the last 2-3 hours you crash from it.
[00:59:06.323 --> 00:59:09.908]  Most folks respond to this saying 10 hours of energy with no crash.
[00:59:10.088 --> 00:59:13.652]  Everybody's metabolic system is different, so experience it for yourself, but here's the bottom line.
[00:59:13.872 --> 00:59:17.277]  These products together are at the lowest price ever.
[00:59:17.997 --> 00:59:20.698]  33% off by itself for TurboForce.
[00:59:20.978 --> 00:59:22.578]  33% off with a BrainForce.
[00:59:22.698 --> 00:59:24.518]  BrainForce is 50% off when you combo it.
[00:59:24.558 --> 00:59:25.859]  That is an amazing deal.
[00:59:25.899 --> 00:59:32.540]  Go to m4warslife.com to specifically find the sub page for the combo set or go to m4warsstore.com that is the umbrella site.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:35.021]  And your funding to get these products makes it all possible.
[00:59:35.141 --> 00:59:38.041]  Sign up for auto-ship, an additional 10% off on your next order.
[00:59:38.061 --> 00:59:40.522]  A lot of other big deals at m4warslife.com.
[00:59:40.542 --> 00:59:41.142]  Check it out today.
[00:59:56.451 --> 01:00:03.117]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:03.478 --> 01:00:07.241]  Alexandria Crazy Eyes Cortez released her new green deal.
[01:00:07.581 --> 01:00:11.685]  Some of the proposals are so insane that many thought that they had to be a joke.
[01:00:12.065 --> 01:00:19.232]  But the part about stopping cows from farting and giving money to those who are unwilling to work were actually in the plans.
[01:00:19.292 --> 01:00:34.357]  So I decided to create some satirical screenshots, adding that we would all get a free massage chair, that the farmers needed an adequate supply of brawn dough, because it's got what plants crave, and that we would have to make our coffee from recycled urine.
[01:00:34.497 --> 01:00:37.418]  When I first posted them online, I said, spread it around, guys.
[01:00:37.738 --> 01:00:39.579]  Let's see if AOC will fact check.
[01:00:44.161 --> 01:00:49.403]  But certainly she wouldn't be so foolish to fact-check what should be an obvious joke, right?
[01:00:49.924 --> 01:00:50.684]  Oh wait, what's this?
[01:00:50.984 --> 01:00:54.566]  She literally quote-tweeted someone who posted the screenshots, adding,
[01:01:02.469 --> 01:01:15.440]  It's not a fake version, it's called satire, which, according to the dictionary, which you've obviously never cracked open, says is the use of irony, sarcasm, and ridicule in exposing, denouncing, or deriding someone.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:28.631]  In this one, all I did is take the actual text from her website, offering people great jobs, vacations, free food, and literally free money for those who are unwilling to work, and I just added that we don't get a free massage chair!
[01:01:28.911 --> 01:01:29.892]  Oh, it gets even better!
[01:01:29.932 --> 01:01:39.780]  Then her advisor went on Tucker Carlson and was asked about some of the crazy stuff that's in the plan, and he said that those are just some of the proposals from the fake screenshots going around!
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:41.541]  Professor, thanks very much for coming on.
[01:01:41.802 --> 01:01:43.143]  So, can I just ask the obvious question?
[01:01:43.543 --> 01:01:46.866]  Why would we ever pay people who are, quote, unwilling to work?
[01:01:48.327 --> 01:01:49.488]  We never would, right?
[01:01:49.568 --> 01:01:51.610]  And AOC has never said anything like that, right?
[01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:52.070]  I think you're right.
[01:02:00.468 --> 01:02:03.792]  No, no.
[01:02:03.852 --> 01:02:05.995]  She's actually tweeted it out to laugh at it.
[01:02:06.075 --> 01:02:09.820]  If you look at her latest tweets, it seems that apparently some Republicans have put it out there.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:10.841]  I don't know the details.
[01:02:14.406 --> 01:02:15.507]  It seemed a little ridiculous!
[01:02:15.547 --> 01:02:19.229]  Now this guy lied to Tucker Carlson and later admitted that he lied.
[01:02:19.249 --> 01:02:26.873]  And Tucker took him for his word because those parts of the proposal do seem like parodies, but those parts are actually real!
[01:02:27.053 --> 01:02:34.538]  This caused a lot of confusion, leading the Washington Post to ask, what's actually in the Green New Deal from Democrats?
[01:02:34.758 --> 01:02:50.736]  What happened here was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez deleted the original version that she posted on her website about the cow farts and giving people money who were unwilling to work because so many people were ridiculing her and then she said that those parts were just from the fake screenshots.
[01:02:50.896 --> 01:02:57.677]  Thankfully, the Internet Wayback Machine has an archive of the original version, which shows that they are lying.
[01:02:57.778 --> 01:03:07.500]  The Washington Post even said that it was misleading for Ocasio-Cortez to mention the, quote, doctored materials as she responds to these attacks.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:13.261]  Most of the criticism she is responding to was based on documents from her office.
[01:03:13.741 --> 01:03:17.182]  Not fake plans for recycling urine.
[01:03:17.662 --> 01:03:25.384]  Even Snopes fact-checked my memes asking, does the Green New Deal proposal include a recycling urine provision?
[01:03:25.704 --> 01:03:34.426]  Claim, the Green New Deal legislation of 2019 includes a provision requiring men to recycle their urine to use for coffee.
[01:03:35.126 --> 01:03:36.827]  We have discovered that this is false!
[01:03:37.127 --> 01:03:46.754]  A screenshot supposedly showing a section of the proposed Green New Deal legislation introduced by Alexandria Crazy-Eyes Cortez began to circulate on social media.
[01:03:46.854 --> 01:03:56.581]  The odd provision seemingly requiring men to recycle their urine to be used in preparing coffee or juice was not a genuine section of the Green New Deal.
[01:03:57.001 --> 01:04:01.685]  The image was created by YouTube conspiracy theorist Mark Dice
[01:04:02.045 --> 01:04:09.130]  who posted it on both his Twitter and Facebook accounts and urged his reader to spread the fake document.
[01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:10.671]  It should have been obvious that it was a joke.
[01:04:10.931 --> 01:04:11.992]  I said it was a joke.
[01:04:12.332 --> 01:04:21.558]  And I even joked how funny it would be if Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fact-checked the joke, which she did, making this joke a grand slam.
[01:04:21.758 --> 01:04:26.001]  If you guys saw the supposed screenshots on my social media and thought that they were real, I apologize.
[01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:30.324]  And I won't hold it against you because the Green New Deal was that crazy.
[01:04:30.564 --> 01:04:41.071]  By the way, Snopes calls me a YouTube conspiracy theorist because they literally got their information from me from Wikipedia, the place where even fifth graders know not to use as a source.
[01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:43.192]  I still can't believe that she actually took the bait.
[01:04:43.553 --> 01:04:45.314]  And in the words of the great Hannibal Smith,
[01:04:45.934 --> 01:04:47.576]  I love it when a plan comes together.
[01:04:47.896 --> 01:04:54.343]  But we are up against a mass psychosis that's either caused by liberalism, or liberalism is the effect of that psychosis.
[01:05:05.199 --> 01:05:08.602]  For those looking for the ultimate source of energy for their day.
[01:05:08.862 --> 01:05:09.282]  Every day.
[01:05:09.663 --> 01:05:11.724]  The Brain Synergy Combo is here.
[01:05:12.145 --> 01:05:21.532]  Combining the powerful Turbo Force and Brain Force Plus nootropic formulas, this combo has what you need to hit your maximum potential every day.
[01:05:21.912 --> 01:05:31.080]  Take the tasty tropical berry flavored Turbo Force instant ring hits with you on the go or at work to help provide you with focus, clarity, and energy.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:44.911]  And to reach your full potential, hit the next generation of advanced neural activation with the BrainForce Plus Neutropic, a fan-favorite formula fueled by powerful, time-tested ingredients for a true 360 win.
[01:05:45.571 --> 01:05:51.876]  With this combo, you can have energy wherever you need, at home, on the go, in the car, and more.
[01:05:52.337 --> 01:05:58.902]  Get pure energy on tap and take advantage of old and new InfoWars powerhouse formulas with
[01:05:59.222 --> 01:06:00.224]  We're good to go.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:28.943]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:32.504 --> 01:06:45.509]  Alright, I don't want to attack one of the biggest podcasters in UFC, color commentators, and I got us in movies, TV shows, Fear Factor, you name it, Joe Rogan.
[01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:49.470]  But when Joe decided to join Soros,
[01:06:51.112 --> 01:06:56.394]  He decided to join the Globalist and then build these glass houses where I'm a bad guy, but he's a good guy.
[01:06:57.635 --> 01:07:01.076]  Well, I started doing homework and looking into Joe.
[01:07:03.237 --> 01:07:15.102]  So at the bottom of the hour, this has gotten no attention, but if you think wearing blackface is bad, if you think dressing up in a KKK outfit is bad, which I think it's the context it's in.
[01:07:15.142 --> 01:07:16.083]  I mean, I'm not defending it.
[01:07:16.103 --> 01:07:16.723]  I've never done that.
[01:07:19.904 --> 01:07:24.607]  If you think that, then what Joe did is like capital MERT.
[01:07:27.609 --> 01:07:37.496]  So the video is coming up at the bottom of the hour just to show how if you're a leftist, you can do whatever you want and say whatever you want.
[01:07:39.057 --> 01:07:41.939]  But if you're not, you're held to another standard.
[01:07:41.979 --> 01:07:46.722]  So I'm not calling for Joe to lose his sponsors or be removed from the air.
[01:07:47.163 --> 01:07:48.384]  I'm simply showing Joe
[01:07:49.588 --> 01:07:53.570]  What it's like when somebody starts coming after you.
[01:07:56.832 --> 01:08:07.397]  Because, you know, if Joe wants to sit there while he thinks they're shoving me under the water, and he's up there on the bank kind of peeing down on me, well, I'm going to reach up and drag him down with me.
[01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:11.059]  Because that's fair, right?
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:18.563]  Because if I said the stuff that we're going to play a Joe Rogan saying, I would be off the air.
[01:08:21.203 --> 01:08:23.243]  But see, he's this anointed person.
[01:08:24.004 --> 01:08:25.904]  He's friends with Jack Dorsey, so he's allowed to.
[01:08:25.964 --> 01:08:27.544]  Well, we'll see about that.
[01:08:30.505 --> 01:08:31.785]  We'll see about that coming up.
[01:08:34.025 --> 01:08:35.826]  And again, I don't do this to be mean.
[01:08:36.026 --> 01:08:37.346]  I just can't lay down.
[01:08:39.026 --> 01:08:44.287]  And, you know, I said that's the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:44.367 --> 01:08:46.748]  I have this tendency where I say I'm about to cover something.
[01:08:48.362 --> 01:08:57.891]  And then I go right into it immediately and that's just shows how there's a lot of planning goes in the broadcast and I always throw my own planning to the wayside as soon as I get on air.
[01:08:58.992 --> 01:09:01.434]  Let's drill down into the situation.
[01:09:01.674 --> 01:09:02.695]  And by the way, we're watching.
[01:09:03.496 --> 01:09:09.939]  And they're diligently, like laser beams, is Trump gonna approve what I think is a bad border deal overall.
[01:09:10.299 --> 01:09:11.200]  Yeah, it's a compromise.
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:13.221]  Pelosi said zero against 1.3 billion.
[01:09:13.241 --> 01:09:14.601]  It's only a seven-month deal.
[01:09:14.641 --> 01:09:15.742]  It starts the wall, blah, blah, blah.
[01:09:16.102 --> 01:09:17.783]  Yeah, but then it's got too much DACA in it.
[01:09:18.143 --> 01:09:19.023]  We're watching that.
[01:09:19.103 --> 01:09:20.224]  First, they said Trump would approve it.
[01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:21.564]  Then he said they wouldn't.
[01:09:22.485 --> 01:09:23.305]  Then he said he might.
[01:09:23.465 --> 01:09:27.647]  We're watching that like laser beams.
[01:09:28.648 --> 01:09:31.669]  And we're going to let you know about that coming up in the next segment.
[01:09:37.572 --> 01:09:48.796]  Right now, let's go ahead and get to this news.
[01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:54.198]  Howard Schultz rips the Green New Deal.
[01:09:54.238 --> 01:09:55.638]  We have a video clip we're going to play in a moment.
[01:09:56.579 --> 01:09:57.539]  It's not realistic.
[01:09:58.219 --> 01:10:00.460]  So look at the demographics, look at the numbers.
[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:02.421]  Now some say Ross Perot was working for
[01:10:05.319 --> 01:10:11.844]  And then he got his first six billion from EDS and told folks what they wanted to hear, but it was all just fake populism.
[01:10:14.106 --> 01:10:18.009]  Trump's delivered on real populism so far, at least partially, so I don't think Trump's a shill.
[01:10:18.930 --> 01:10:24.294]  But he's starting to slide over with some of the things he's doing into a trajectory that's not good.
[01:10:24.734 --> 01:10:26.716]  Banning bump stocks, and that's a bunch of hype.
[01:10:26.736 --> 01:10:29.178]  Saying, okay, we'll do DACA.
[01:10:29.758 --> 01:10:30.339]  Things like that.
[01:10:31.482 --> 01:10:33.843]  But Howard Schultz is a big leftist, big liberal.
[01:10:34.244 --> 01:10:38.806]  Hell, Starbucks today is the one that when whites come to buy coffee they go, let's talk about how you're evil because you're white.
[01:10:39.207 --> 01:10:41.788]  I mean, this is re-education camp stuff.
[01:10:43.689 --> 01:10:53.235]  And so Howard Schultz and the Demographics knows that there is a really bad leftist vein that's the real goal of the Democrats.
[01:10:54.002 --> 01:11:00.004]  To live in luxury, but to say they're socialist and communist and promise free health care, free education, don't have to work.
[01:11:00.284 --> 01:11:02.864]  I mean, wow, that's a, that'd be a great civilization.
[01:11:03.164 --> 01:11:06.085]  Free health care, free education, don't have to work if you don't want to.
[01:11:06.325 --> 01:11:06.825]  Those are quotes.
[01:11:06.885 --> 01:11:08.406]  And by the way, we get rid of all the cows.
[01:11:08.446 --> 01:11:11.607]  And Cory Booker's joined that and said, meat eaters, your days are numbered.
[01:11:11.687 --> 01:11:12.687]  Oh, and cheese too.
[01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:15.288]  We're going to tell you what to eat.
[01:11:15.668 --> 01:11:16.748]  What a great group of people.
[01:11:17.728 --> 01:11:18.748]  It's all Bloomberg crap.
[01:11:20.089 --> 01:11:20.829]  The great technocrat.
[01:11:22.554 --> 01:11:43.258]  So Howard Schultz is doing all of this to have the Democrats attack him, and they're all playing along, to siphon away nationalist and conservative and Reagan Democrat votes that are socially liberal but fiscally conservative.
[01:11:44.298 --> 01:11:45.318]  It's all meant to do that.
[01:11:45.898 --> 01:11:51.619]  It's all meant, Howard Schultz 100%, is meant to siphon away votes in the
[01:11:53.197 --> 01:11:57.098]  Rust Belt and other areas from Reagan Democrats away from Trump.
[01:11:57.318 --> 01:11:58.118]  It's that simple.
[01:11:58.619 --> 01:12:05.000]  His whole modus operandi, having the Democrats attack him out of the gates, how they're so upset at him, how dare him.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.581]  It's as phony as a $3 bill.
[01:12:10.422 --> 01:12:15.263]  And then he comes out to Cortez promising, you know, just everything's free.
[01:12:15.443 --> 01:12:16.323]  Everything's wonderful.
[01:12:16.704 --> 01:12:17.964]  Just play video games all day.
[01:12:18.004 --> 01:12:18.564]  Don't worry.
[01:12:20.284 --> 01:12:21.305]  But if a producer
[01:12:22.335 --> 01:12:23.116]  Does it pay their taxes?
[01:12:23.136 --> 01:12:23.916]  Well, SWAT team you.
[01:12:25.817 --> 01:12:27.659]  They know that that's where they're taking us.
[01:12:28.039 --> 01:12:29.460]  So the Republicans can run against that.
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:33.843]  So they bring in a Democrat in the middle to act like, oh, the Democrats are bad and so are the Republicans.
[01:12:34.283 --> 01:12:34.783]  I'm the guy.
[01:12:34.863 --> 01:12:44.270]  He gets the moderate vote that would go with Trump, the nationalist vote that would go with Trump, the Reagan Democrat vote that would go with Trump, and then they siphon away a few points.
[01:12:45.486 --> 01:12:47.047]  Well, he needs like five points, probably.
[01:12:47.647 --> 01:12:48.987]  And Donald Trump loses 2020.
[01:12:49.247 --> 01:12:51.788]  That's what old Howard Schultz is doing.
[01:12:52.188 --> 01:12:53.749]  He thinks he's smarter than everybody.
[01:12:54.189 --> 01:12:55.289]  He thinks we don't see through it.
[01:12:56.230 --> 01:12:59.291]  Now, I don't know if Ross Perot was doing that, but he had that net effect.
[01:13:02.012 --> 01:13:03.912]  But George Herbert Walker would have been bad anyway, so it didn't matter.
[01:13:03.952 --> 01:13:04.453]  It was a moot point.
[01:13:05.413 --> 01:13:06.593]  But this is a little different, isn't it?
[01:13:06.973 --> 01:13:08.454]  So here is Herr Schultz.
[01:13:09.449 --> 01:13:23.536]  When I read the proposed bill in terms of the Green New Deal, and I read that by 2030, they're suggesting that every building in America becomes clean energy, conforms to clean energy.
[01:13:23.876 --> 01:13:33.881]  Just to put that in perspective, because it's not realistic, that would mean that between 2,000 and 3,000 buildings a day would have to be reconstructed.
[01:13:35.168 --> 01:13:36.629]  To conform to what they're saying.
[01:13:54.025 --> 01:13:55.126]  Is not realistic.
[01:13:55.586 --> 01:13:57.827]  That is not being honest with the American people.
[01:13:58.067 --> 01:14:10.072]  But I think it's not, it's immoral to suggest that we can tally up 20, 30, 40, 50 trillion dollars of debt to solve a problem that could be solved in a different way.
[01:14:10.672 --> 01:14:11.992]  It's not that they're disingenuous.
[01:14:12.112 --> 01:14:13.413]  I think they're well-intentioned.
[01:14:13.993 --> 01:14:15.034]  This is not personal.
[01:14:15.094 --> 01:14:18.315]  I just don't agree this is the right way to approach things.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:19.920]  Okay.
[01:14:20.301 --> 01:14:23.523]  Meanwhile, Michael Bloomberg pledges $500 million to unseat Trump in 2020.
[01:14:23.603 --> 01:14:26.786]  And then this is where you really learn the scam.
[01:14:28.387 --> 01:14:29.868]  Nobody deserves to be this rich.
[01:14:29.968 --> 01:14:38.274]  Bill Gates has put over $100 billion of money into a tax-free foundation where he then gets the profits out.
[01:14:39.515 --> 01:14:39.916]  Just like
[01:14:41.414 --> 01:14:44.957]  Bezos and all these groups set it up where they pay basically no taxes.
[01:14:45.537 --> 01:14:55.985]  Then they lobby and say, I'm so rich, I don't pay taxes, we need higher taxes on the middle class, knowing that through government contracts gets funneled to him and vertically integrates the society.
[01:14:56.385 --> 01:14:57.446]  So that's how the scam works.
[01:14:57.867 --> 01:15:03.771]  Bill Gates claimed he had paid too little tax, it did not deserve to be so rich.
[01:15:03.851 --> 01:15:07.214]  The 63 year old, worth 73 billion pounds,
[01:15:08.439 --> 01:15:08.619]  I don't
[01:15:26.129 --> 01:15:30.175]  More than follow the law, but I think things should be more progressive on you.
[01:15:30.255 --> 01:15:31.176]  Make it 100,000 a year.
[01:15:31.717 --> 01:15:35.221]  The father of three made his fortune after founding Microsoft, and it goes on from there.
[01:15:35.241 --> 01:15:38.626]  I mean, what a load of garbage.
[01:15:40.268 --> 01:15:41.370]  What absolute
[01:15:42.978 --> 01:15:49.620]  The tyranny these people are engaged in and how stupid they think we all are.
[01:15:50.561 --> 01:15:52.562]  All right, we'll come back with even more news.
[01:15:53.222 --> 01:15:55.323]  We've discovered what appears to be a false flag.
[01:15:55.943 --> 01:15:57.503]  We'll cover it straight ahead.

[01:17:09.301 --> 01:17:14.143]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the damage.
[01:17:15.223 --> 01:17:16.084]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[01:17:16.844 --> 01:17:17.304]  We stopped her.
[01:17:17.324 --> 01:17:18.245]  We got a nationalist in.
[01:17:19.525 --> 01:17:21.586]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[01:17:21.726 --> 01:17:22.647]  We are winning.

[01:20:06.471 --> 01:20:09.097]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:18.015 --> 01:20:25.719]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:25.739 --> 01:20:35.004]  You get sensitive about the fact that people say, you'll never take a serious controversy.
[01:20:35.744 --> 01:20:36.985]  Well, I have an answer to that.
[01:20:37.005 --> 01:20:40.947]  I said, now, tell me the last time that Jack Benny, Red Skelton,
[01:20:48.596 --> 01:20:49.276]  Can't they see that?
[01:20:50.437 --> 01:20:55.420]  But neither do they think that just because you have a Tonight Show that you must deal in serious issues.
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:56.341]  That's a danger.
[01:20:57.001 --> 01:20:57.822]  It's a real danger.
[01:20:57.942 --> 01:21:04.266]  Once you start that, you start to get that self-important feeling that what you say has great import.
[01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:07.067]  And you know, strangely enough, you could use that show as a forum.
[01:21:07.107 --> 01:21:08.088]  You could sway people.
[01:21:08.188 --> 01:21:09.689]  And I don't think you should as an entertainer.
[01:21:19.931 --> 01:21:22.013]  Oh yeah!
[01:21:22.253 --> 01:21:22.994]  Oh yeah!
[01:21:23.254 --> 01:21:29.639]  Oh yeah!
[01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:45.613]  Spied a little thing and I followed her all night In her funky fine Levi's and her sweater's kinda tight She had a west coast truck
[01:21:48.227 --> 01:21:49.147]  Wow, wow.
[01:21:49.207 --> 01:21:49.647]  Alright.
[01:22:15.271 --> 01:22:21.392]  I have too much news to get to in too many clips and too much new stuff breaking at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:22:21.412 --> 01:22:26.113]  Just remember, the globalists work around the clock to try to stop people visiting those sites.
[01:22:26.633 --> 01:22:30.794]  When you spread the word about them, you frustrate their entire plan, and I salute you.
[01:22:31.454 --> 01:22:33.754]  I want to get into Donald Trump Jr.
[01:22:33.794 --> 01:22:38.855]  saying to youth, reject your loser teachers pushing socialism.
[01:22:39.675 --> 01:22:43.016]  And he got attacked all over the news for saying socialism is a loser.
[01:22:44.056 --> 01:23:00.823]  That's like saying, you know, jumping off a 50-foot balcony and breaking both your legs is a loser move, or injecting heroin is a loser move, or... I mean, any of this stuff is loser moves, and so you try to ridicule and bully everyone to not have free speech.
[01:23:00.863 --> 01:23:05.545]  But first, this, which really concerns me living in Austin, Texas.
[01:23:06.166 --> 01:23:08.406]  People ask me all the time, why do you live in Austin, Texas?
[01:23:08.466 --> 01:23:11.548]  Well, my grandmother and my grandfather are from here.
[01:23:12.481 --> 01:23:13.742]  I grew up outside Dallas.
[01:23:14.283 --> 01:23:18.386]  My family's been in Texas since Washington on the Brazos, 1820s.
[01:23:19.347 --> 01:23:24.231]  And we were, on both sides of the family, involved in the founding of the nation of Texas.
[01:23:25.272 --> 01:23:31.037]  And, you know, had ancestors that were the highest levels of the government of Texas, fought and died in the wars for Texas.
[01:23:31.097 --> 01:23:33.459]  And then, you know, after that, the horrible Civil War.
[01:23:35.583 --> 01:23:42.067]  I'm not evacuating Austin just because we now have poop all over the streets like San Francisco or Seattle.
[01:23:42.967 --> 01:23:43.408]  And needles.
[01:23:44.388 --> 01:23:45.309]  And the things that come with it.
[01:23:47.597 --> 01:23:55.023]  I believe we can turn this around, but they plan to turn the state blue, and I sit back and I get confused, like, why do you leave Seattle?
[01:23:55.103 --> 01:23:56.764]  Why do you leave Portland, Oregon?
[01:23:57.325 --> 01:23:59.386]  Why do you leave Los Angeles, California?
[01:23:59.447 --> 01:24:01.328]  Why do you leave San Francisco, California?
[01:24:01.848 --> 01:24:03.270]  And then why do you come here?
[01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:15.980]  And I've literally, it's happened to my ex-wife, it's happened to my wife, it's happened to me, where they like, you got four kids, and you're in Whole Foods, they come over and say, they're pissed, because they don't have kids, they're not happy.
[01:24:17.363 --> 01:24:18.664]  And they're not good-looking like my wife.
[01:24:18.684 --> 01:24:20.085]  Part of it's just she's good-looking.
[01:24:20.125 --> 01:24:21.025]  She's a sexy lady.
[01:24:22.386 --> 01:24:24.687]  But they're angry at this level of wealth.
[01:24:25.307 --> 01:24:26.528]  Physical, genetic wealth.
[01:24:28.389 --> 01:24:33.712]  And so, most Californians that flee, I know them.
[01:24:35.473 --> 01:24:40.556]  And my kids go to school, and then I'll be around these parents like, we don't really like you, but we like your daughter.
[01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:43.978]  I'm like, oh, who's the Alex Jones you don't like?
[01:24:44.058 --> 01:24:45.459]  Like, the one you hear about on the news?
[01:24:47.785 --> 01:24:56.330]  And it's just the arrogance, the sanctimoniousness, the elitism of these people.
[01:24:57.750 --> 01:25:03.573]  Because, you know, it's way overinflated because Democrats get around their income tax with property tax write-offs that Trump got rid of.
[01:25:03.593 --> 01:25:05.354]  A lot of conservatives are mad at that.
[01:25:05.374 --> 01:25:07.155]  That's the biggest screw you to Democrats ever.
[01:25:07.555 --> 01:25:14.639]  Every blue state has property taxes, you know, that people hide all their stuff in the property taxes and they write it off.
[01:25:15.039 --> 01:25:16.020]  That's how the scam works.
[01:25:17.093 --> 01:25:17.793]  Trump's ending that.
[01:25:18.193 --> 01:25:19.154]  One of the good things he's done.
[01:25:19.534 --> 01:25:20.434]  I love sticking it to him.
[01:25:20.954 --> 01:25:28.676]  But they can sell some $5 million three bedroom, four bedroom, move here and buy a Ponderosa, a big old ranch.
[01:25:28.716 --> 01:25:36.979]  The problem is, I bought nine acres and a ranch house and a casita, a cottage.
[01:25:38.891 --> 01:25:39.792]  For a million dollars.
[01:25:40.633 --> 01:25:41.454]  That's what the note was.
[01:25:42.415 --> 01:25:45.498]  By the time I got divorced, it was worth like two and a half million dollars.
[01:25:45.859 --> 01:25:47.220]  Now it's worth like four million dollars.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:47.921]  I don't have it.
[01:25:47.961 --> 01:25:48.582]  My ex-wife does.
[01:25:49.042 --> 01:25:51.885]  But that's the type in ten years what's happened to property.
[01:25:52.026 --> 01:25:53.027]  I can't buy that now.
[01:25:55.051 --> 01:25:56.032]  I can't sign the note.
[01:25:56.192 --> 01:25:58.233]  I mean, Jones is incredibly rich.
[01:25:58.853 --> 01:26:00.514]  40 million gross sales.
[01:26:00.894 --> 01:26:02.495]  Yeah, half that's product costs.
[01:26:02.515 --> 01:26:05.536]  Then all the employees and the bandwidth.
[01:26:05.736 --> 01:26:07.257]  I'd be happy to make a bunch of money.
[01:26:07.497 --> 01:26:09.678]  I'd love to say, we've got an extra 20 million.
[01:26:09.878 --> 01:26:11.679]  We're expanding and kicking their ass.
[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:14.261]  But that's not how it works.
[01:26:15.181 --> 01:26:17.502]  I'm spending money I made five years ago right now.
[01:26:18.723 --> 01:26:20.384]  Which is fine, because it's all about the mission.
[01:26:20.644 --> 01:26:21.664]  And I believe we're going to come through this.
[01:26:21.704 --> 01:26:24.606]  But I've literally had Democrats
[01:26:26.007 --> 01:26:26.708]  Repeatedly.
[01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:32.993]  At the grocery store and at a hamburger place where you pull through.
[01:26:33.013 --> 01:26:33.934]  Pete Terry's.
[01:26:35.616 --> 01:26:36.797]  Thought about it before at F-150.
[01:26:38.458 --> 01:26:40.060]  They'll walk right in front of you when you're already rolling.
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:47.406]  And you'll stop, and when you stop and say sorry as a Texan, just like they all say F you Alex Jones, they go, F you!
[01:26:47.847 --> 01:26:49.068]  And F your big truck!
[01:26:50.632 --> 01:26:53.734]  And so, one time I pulled over and got out, because I was going to get my hamburger.
[01:26:53.754 --> 01:26:55.555]  And I went, hey, there's no need for that.
[01:26:55.595 --> 01:26:58.376]  They go, let me guess, you're all from California.
[01:26:58.436 --> 01:27:01.418]  There's a big group of them picking their hamburgers up at the little window there.
[01:27:01.978 --> 01:27:03.279]  He carries his little window, you pick him up.
[01:27:03.299 --> 01:27:05.480]  They're like, of course we are, you Texas scum!
[01:27:06.461 --> 01:27:08.602]  That was like five years ago, because my son was with me.
[01:27:09.062 --> 01:27:10.403]  We'd gone to Barton Springs to swim.
[01:27:11.103 --> 01:27:15.646]  And all I'm getting at is, it's getting worse and worse now, where
[01:27:16.874 --> 01:27:23.695]  You walk into a restaurant, or anywhere, and you got your good-looking wife, and you got your good-looking kids, man, and these people have envy.
[01:27:24.035 --> 01:27:26.276]  Because they all look like they could be white, black, Hispanic.
[01:27:26.656 --> 01:27:29.016]  They look like they've been shot with a mutation ray.
[01:27:29.036 --> 01:27:42.999]  They look mentally retarded, they look crazy, they look demonic, they're pissed, none of... and they're just strut... they can hardly walk, and they just look at somebody, and I'm not Mr. Mr. Win the Beauty Pageant, but I'm a man.
[01:27:43.899 --> 01:27:44.919]  And they smell it.
[01:27:46.749 --> 01:27:47.590]  Like, I'll have let this go.
[01:27:47.650 --> 01:27:49.611]  I was like at a Dick's Sporting Goods about a month ago.
[01:27:50.692 --> 01:27:52.894]  And some guy walks in and goes, oh, you walk around.
[01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:53.794]  That's some liberal thing.
[01:27:53.834 --> 01:27:54.895]  It's happened three times now.
[01:27:55.255 --> 01:27:56.276]  Twice in front of my wife.
[01:27:57.277 --> 01:27:58.178]  Once in Fredericksburg.
[01:27:58.238 --> 01:27:58.918]  Once in a grocery store.
[01:27:59.258 --> 01:28:01.200]  Happened to me in a Dick's Sporting Goods by myself.
[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:05.883]  I mean, they're trying to buy some workout clothes because my other ones have got holes in them.
[01:28:06.684 --> 01:28:09.006]  And this guy walks in and goes, are you some kind of strong man?
[01:28:09.026 --> 01:28:12.148]  And I'm like, no, I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:28:12.168 --> 01:28:14.230]  He goes, oh, you just walk around like you're really tough.
[01:28:16.465 --> 01:28:17.747]  And he was like some 6'3 dude.
[01:28:17.968 --> 01:28:18.228]  I'm like 5'11.
[01:28:18.348 --> 01:28:20.732]  I'm like, he was just skating like bike rider type.
[01:28:20.752 --> 01:28:22.415]  I'm like, no man, I don't think I'm tough.
[01:28:22.435 --> 01:28:22.976]  He goes, oh really?
[01:28:23.016 --> 01:28:25.199]  Well, just thought you, you know, think you're somebody.
[01:28:26.221 --> 01:28:28.805]  And I was just looking at him, but see, it's the thing, it's the spiritual thing.
[01:28:29.867 --> 01:28:30.708]  So here's the headlines.
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:38.746]  More Californians, CNBC reports, are considering fleeing the state as they blame sky-high costs.
[01:28:39.266 --> 01:28:39.907]  Survey finds.
[01:28:39.927 --> 01:28:40.507]  Well, don't worry.
[01:28:41.388 --> 01:28:42.929]  The new governor is a psychotic.
[01:28:42.970 --> 01:28:43.490]  He's got it.
[01:28:44.571 --> 01:28:47.113]  Americans continue their march to low-tax states.
[01:28:47.153 --> 01:28:47.593]  The Hill.
[01:28:49.555 --> 01:28:53.138]  So that's all I'm getting at is, it's like, just stay in your hell.
[01:28:53.899 --> 01:28:55.240]  Just stay in your cesspit.
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:56.301]  Stay away from me.
[01:28:56.321 --> 01:28:58.163]  I trigger them, though.
[01:28:58.223 --> 01:28:58.863]  I trigger them.
[01:28:58.983 --> 01:28:59.544]  I trigger them.
[01:29:12.129 --> 01:29:20.536]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:29:21.136 --> 01:29:30.984]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:29:31.224 --> 01:29:39.751]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:41.560]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:42.980]  You must experience it.
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:45.121]  It is a total game-changer.
[01:29:45.181 --> 01:29:49.422]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:29:50.082 --> 01:29:51.522]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[01:29:51.602 --> 01:29:52.602]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[01:29:53.082 --> 01:29:59.224]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:29:59.764 --> 01:30:01.244]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[01:30:17.998 --> 01:30:18.759]  InfoWars.
[01:30:19.119 --> 01:30:20.000]  Tomorrow's news.
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:20.760]  Today.
[01:30:25.924 --> 01:30:27.065]  No need to be afraid.
[01:30:27.585 --> 01:30:28.946]  I'm your Google assistant.
[01:30:29.546 --> 01:30:30.227]  Let's begin.
[01:30:31.288 --> 01:30:34.350]  Australia has become a testing ground for Google.
[01:30:35.931 --> 01:30:38.173]  They are legalizing driverless cars.
[01:30:40.815 --> 01:30:45.258]  They are disrupting the tourist business by altering Google Maps data.
[01:30:47.253 --> 01:30:51.155]  And now they are filtering the news for the entire country.
[01:30:53.136 --> 01:30:59.260]  An Australian watchdog group wanted to see Google's algorithms, but Google denied them.
[01:31:00.461 --> 01:31:03.442]  The fight for freedom has never been more grave.
[01:31:04.023 --> 01:31:07.365]  And now, more than ever, the world needs you.
[01:31:09.286 --> 01:31:12.888]  We are running into next level attempts to not get the broadcast out, so...
[01:31:14.111 --> 01:31:14.932]  Everything's free to air.
[01:31:15.512 --> 01:31:17.995]  We send the TV show out on satellite over the internet.
[01:31:19.476 --> 01:31:20.437]  Anyone wants to pick it up.
[01:31:20.517 --> 01:31:21.418]  Anyone wants to carry it.
[01:31:21.438 --> 01:31:22.519]  Anybody wants to chop it up.
[01:31:22.899 --> 01:31:24.400]  You want to re-stream it on your website.
[01:31:24.921 --> 01:31:34.069]  That's how we're going to get around all this is for other people to set up InfoWars backup stations where you get our streams and then you re-send them out on different formats, different ways.

[01:32:39.118 --> 01:32:40.159]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.661]  We are under attack!

[01:32:58.163 --> 01:32:58.944]  InfoWars.
[01:32:59.285 --> 01:33:00.206]  Tomorrow's news.
[01:33:00.487 --> 01:33:00.887]  Today.
[01:33:05.935 --> 01:33:08.538]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.973 --> 01:33:28.937]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:51.684 --> 01:33:53.025]  There's Planet of the Apes, man.
[01:33:53.045 --> 01:33:54.126]  We're gonna go see Planet of the Apes.
[01:33:54.407 --> 01:33:57.470]  So I look on the iPhone app, and it says, OK, take me to this one.
[01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:58.531]  And the guy goes, OK.
[01:33:58.571 --> 01:33:59.632]  I go, is that in a good neighborhood?
[01:33:59.852 --> 01:34:01.033]  He's like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:34:01.193 --> 01:34:02.154]  Guy barely speaks English.
[01:34:02.575 --> 01:34:03.315]  He takes us there.
[01:34:03.576 --> 01:34:04.917]  We get out, and we're giggling.
[01:34:04.937 --> 01:34:06.178]  Ooh, we're gonna go see Planet of the Apes.
[01:34:06.278 --> 01:34:08.360]  We walk into Planet of the Apes.
[01:34:09.361 --> 01:34:10.823]  We walked into Africa, dude.
[01:34:11.884 --> 01:34:15.167]  We walked in the door, and there was no white people.
[01:34:15.327 --> 01:34:16.168]  There was no white people.
[01:34:24.835 --> 01:34:29.677]  Boys and girls take warning if you go near the lake.
[01:34:29.697 --> 01:34:36.240]  Keep your eyes wide open and look for Sneaky Snake.
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:46.124]  Now maybe you won't see him, maybe you won't hear, but he'll sneak up behind you.
[01:34:49.854 --> 01:34:56.940]  And then Sneaky Snake goes dancing, a-wigglin' and a-hissin'.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:02.644]  Sneaky Snake goes dancing, a-gigglin' and a-kissin'.
[01:35:03.605 --> 01:35:08.729]  I don't like old Sneaky Snake, he laughs too much, you see.
[01:35:09.790 --> 01:35:15.055]  When he goes a-wigglin' through the grass, it tickles his underneath.
[01:35:17.595 --> 01:35:23.062]  Well, Sneaky Snake drinks root beer, and he just makes me sick.
[01:35:24.424 --> 01:35:29.369]  When he is not dancing, he looks just like a stick.
[01:35:30.631 --> 01:35:35.877]  Now he doesn't have any arms or legs, you cannot see his ears.
[01:35:36.978 --> 01:35:42.382]  And while we are not looking, he's stealing all of our beer.
[01:35:42.602 --> 01:35:49.127]  And then Sneaky Snake goes dancing, a wiggling and a hissing.
[01:35:49.947 --> 01:35:55.571]  Sneaky Snake goes dancing, a giggling and a kissing.
[01:35:56.391 --> 01:35:59.173]  Alright folks, I'm going to do my Joe Rogan piece next segment.
[01:36:00.474 --> 01:36:02.175]  We'll get to it then.
[01:36:02.215 --> 01:36:06.418]  I'm going to go to some very important special reports right now for you.
[01:36:07.679 --> 01:36:08.760]  This needs to be seen.
[01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:11.622]  This is our own Caitlin Bennett reporting for Infowars.com.
[01:36:12.182 --> 01:36:14.844]  Triggered feminists get destroyed by Caitlin Bennett.
[01:36:16.112 --> 01:36:17.493]  They get bothered by the facts.
[01:36:17.513 --> 01:36:26.197]  We're going to play this special report because it just gets to what these universities have turned into and what they have become.
[01:36:27.237 --> 01:36:30.779]  The video and the article is up on Infowars.com.
[01:36:31.599 --> 01:36:32.800]  Let's go ahead and roll that report.
[01:36:33.829 --> 01:36:34.849]  I'm like blown away.
[01:36:34.929 --> 01:36:37.250]  I've never, I didn't know you were this crazy.
[01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:40.431]  I know, it's so crazy to not support murder.
[01:36:40.451 --> 01:36:41.911]  I would have known.
[01:36:42.331 --> 01:36:43.211]  Oh wow.
[01:36:43.231 --> 01:36:44.992]  Wow, I gotta go.
[01:36:45.012 --> 01:36:46.632]  Wow, you, I owe you.
[01:36:46.692 --> 01:36:47.792]  Facts scare people.
[01:36:56.654 --> 01:36:59.415]  Why, why aren't, why aren't they allowed to talk to me?
[01:37:01.124 --> 01:37:04.547]  Okay, then I suggest that you should probably keep your mouth shut and let them do what they want.
[01:37:04.568 --> 01:37:06.449]  You're aggressive.
[01:37:06.489 --> 01:37:06.710]  Okay.
[01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:07.550]  Can I talk to you?
[01:37:08.491 --> 01:37:09.212]  Are you gonna be rude?
[01:37:09.352 --> 01:37:10.213]  Can I not hear a word?
[01:37:10.794 --> 01:37:10.914]  No.
[01:37:12.719 --> 01:37:15.260]  Yes, I record every interaction I have on a college campus.
[01:37:19.763 --> 01:37:21.924]  What am I gaining?
[01:37:22.264 --> 01:37:24.305]  I'm just talking to students and getting their opinions.
[01:37:24.485 --> 01:37:25.686]  I want to ask them questions.
[01:37:25.726 --> 01:37:26.566]  We're making videos.
[01:37:26.586 --> 01:37:27.147]  It's my job.
[01:37:27.207 --> 01:37:27.307]  Money.
[01:37:32.813 --> 01:37:33.994]  You get paid to do this?
[01:37:34.054 --> 01:37:34.314]  Yes.
[01:37:34.654 --> 01:37:36.015]  By who, can I ask?
[01:37:36.075 --> 01:37:37.676]  Like, who wants you to be doing this?
[01:37:38.477 --> 01:37:39.918]  Oh my god, it's a scam.
[01:37:40.458 --> 01:37:41.519]  She's like running a scam.
[01:37:42.539 --> 01:37:43.760]  Do you enjoy doing this?
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:44.300]  I do.
[01:37:45.061 --> 01:37:46.662]  Don't you have a degree from Kent?
[01:37:46.882 --> 01:37:47.242]  I do.
[01:37:47.643 --> 01:37:49.184]  And this is what you choose to do with it?
[01:37:49.304 --> 01:37:49.584]  Yes.
[01:37:49.904 --> 01:37:50.925]  This is your choice.
[01:37:51.485 --> 01:37:53.906]  Yes, isn't this women's empowerment?
[01:37:53.946 --> 01:37:55.087]  You can do whatever you want.
[01:37:55.347 --> 01:37:58.208]  Feminism and supporting women's rights to go out and engage in free speech.
[01:37:58.249 --> 01:38:01.930]  I think you have such a platform that you could be doing great things with.
[01:38:02.251 --> 01:38:05.892]  I think promoting gun rights is a great thing to use my platform for.
[01:38:05.912 --> 01:38:07.213]  On a college campus?
[01:38:07.533 --> 01:38:08.394]  Yes.
[01:38:08.454 --> 01:38:10.175]  Honestly, I have no problem with gun rights.
[01:38:10.195 --> 01:38:12.136]  I just think this is a little crazy.
[01:38:12.916 --> 01:38:13.136]  What?
[01:38:13.356 --> 01:38:14.297]  What's so crazy about?
[01:38:14.357 --> 01:38:17.438]  That you're standing around college campuses talking about it.
[01:38:17.478 --> 01:38:20.120]  Like, aren't there better places to be speaking about this?
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:23.141]  No, college campuses are the perfect place to talk about gun rights.
[01:38:23.161 --> 01:38:23.842]  Can you tell me why?
[01:38:24.002 --> 01:38:27.864]  Because one in five women will be sexually assaulted on a college campus.
[01:38:28.504 --> 01:38:34.067]  That is your choice, but don't take your choice away from me to be able to defend myself against a rapist on campus.
[01:38:34.347 --> 01:38:35.088]  Don't be selfish.
[01:38:36.228 --> 01:38:42.314]  I'm really confused why you think giving people guns is the right idea.
[01:38:42.654 --> 01:38:47.498]  I don't even think people... I never said we should... I didn't say we should give people guns.
[01:38:47.538 --> 01:38:48.579]  I said you should have the choice.
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:52.743]  The choice is a little bit different than... Are you pro-choice?
[01:38:53.563 --> 01:38:54.344]  Of course I am.
[01:38:54.464 --> 01:38:58.468]  So why don't you respect my right to choose what firearm I have?
[01:38:59.372 --> 01:39:08.066]  You can have whatever firearm you want, but walking around a college campus promoting it is probably one of the worst ways to get the message out.
[01:39:08.166 --> 01:39:09.268]  I'm sorry you feel that way.
[01:39:09.408 --> 01:39:11.351]  That's disappointing that... Are you a feminist?
[01:39:12.779 --> 01:39:13.440]  Does it matter?
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:14.180]  It does matter.
[01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:15.321]  No, it doesn't.
[01:39:15.341 --> 01:39:16.182]  You're not a feminist.
[01:39:16.202 --> 01:39:17.923]  I think it's two different issues.
[01:39:18.103 --> 01:39:18.623]  It's not.
[01:39:18.804 --> 01:39:19.244]  It's not.
[01:39:19.404 --> 01:39:23.787]  Feminist fallacy to try and convince your argument, and you're wrong.
[01:39:24.768 --> 01:39:26.249]  I'm right, but thank you for your opinion.
[01:39:26.289 --> 01:39:26.890]  I appreciate it.
[01:39:26.910 --> 01:39:28.831]  See, I told you she was too close-minded.
[01:39:28.891 --> 01:39:31.773]  You're very aggressive.
[01:39:31.853 --> 01:39:33.614]  You're the one that was shouting at me.
[01:39:33.675 --> 01:39:35.536]  You want to talk about aggressive?
[01:39:35.556 --> 01:39:37.517]  That's some feminism.
[01:39:38.498 --> 01:39:39.959]  Do I need to introduce myself?
[01:39:39.979 --> 01:39:41.781]  Do you want me to say my pronouns too while I'm at it?
[01:39:42.699 --> 01:39:44.722]  Are you a feminist after you just said that?
[01:39:44.742 --> 01:39:45.683]  No.
[01:39:46.605 --> 01:39:50.270]  So you're trying to use people's own opinions against them?
[01:39:50.570 --> 01:39:54.255]  Yes, I want you to see your hypocrisy and your own arguments.
[01:39:56.461 --> 01:39:58.763]  What hypocrisy?
[01:39:59.805 --> 01:40:07.613]  You're saying women should be able to protect themselves, that's their right, but you aren't a feminist.
[01:40:08.174 --> 01:40:12.018]  Yeah, I do not associate with the feminists of today.
[01:40:12.398 --> 01:40:13.399]  I don't associate with that.
[01:40:13.519 --> 01:40:15.982]  I believe in equality and equal rights for everyone.
[01:40:17.003 --> 01:40:20.186]  But today's feminists, I don't support what they do.
[01:40:20.327 --> 01:40:24.751]  I don't support... A lot of feminists we see at the Women's March, they don't support what I support.
[01:40:25.111 --> 01:40:26.052]  They support abortion.
[01:40:26.072 --> 01:40:26.933]  I don't support that.
[01:40:26.953 --> 01:40:27.954]  No, they're pro-choice.
[01:40:28.095 --> 01:40:30.357]  They should have their choice as well.
[01:40:30.377 --> 01:40:31.198]  Do you not agree with that?
[01:40:31.358 --> 01:40:33.740]  I don't think people have the choice to kill others.
[01:40:33.981 --> 01:40:39.406]  I don't think that's... Are you trying to say that early abortion is killing?
[01:40:40.515 --> 01:40:42.357]  I think once it has a heartbeat, it is murder.
[01:40:42.377 --> 01:40:43.979]  Are you saying condoms are also abortion?
[01:40:43.999 --> 01:40:46.602]  No, because you have to have a fertilized egg.
[01:40:46.923 --> 01:40:47.443]  No, it's not.
[01:40:47.764 --> 01:40:54.792]  You have to have a fertilized egg and it has to be attached inside the uterine wall for it to start developing into a baby.
[01:40:54.972 --> 01:40:59.498]  So are you trying to say that if a woman gets raped that it is not her choice to get an abortion?
[01:40:59.538 --> 01:41:00.238]  That is what I'm saying.
[01:41:01.318 --> 01:41:02.479]  Oh wow!
[01:41:02.579 --> 01:41:05.121]  There's really a lot of hypocrisy in what you say then.
[01:41:05.881 --> 01:41:08.523]  I appreciate your opinions.
[01:41:09.284 --> 01:41:13.646]  It's not your body.
[01:41:14.187 --> 01:41:17.689]  You know what will protect against someone getting raped and they don't have to have an abortion?
[01:41:17.949 --> 01:41:18.270]  A gun.
[01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:19.030]  Guess what?
[01:41:19.090 --> 01:41:22.272]  If they get knocked upside the head and they can't use a gun, then what?
[01:41:22.873 --> 01:41:24.414]  Alright, thank you.
[01:41:24.994 --> 01:41:26.355]  I don't think two wrongs make a right.
[01:41:26.435 --> 01:41:29.217]  Just because someone was raped doesn't mean that baby should be murdered.
[01:41:30.399 --> 01:41:31.440]  Oh, wow.
[01:41:32.281 --> 01:41:33.341]  I'm like blown away.
[01:41:33.362 --> 01:41:35.763]  I've never... I didn't know you were this crazy.
[01:41:36.324 --> 01:41:36.604]  I know.
[01:41:36.644 --> 01:41:38.926]  It's so crazy to not support murder.
[01:41:38.946 --> 01:41:40.427]  I would have known.
[01:41:40.847 --> 01:41:41.728]  Oh, wow.
[01:41:41.748 --> 01:41:43.570]  Wow, I gotta go.
[01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:46.252]  Wow, you... Facts scare people.
[01:41:46.272 --> 01:41:46.752]  Look at this.
[01:41:46.792 --> 01:41:47.773]  Whoa, look at her!
[01:41:47.793 --> 01:41:52.857]  She just said abortion is murder.
[01:41:53.137 --> 01:41:55.779]  And that women are... No abortion here!
[01:41:55.819 --> 01:41:55.939]  No!
[01:41:58.925 --> 01:42:00.745]  Oh my God, did you hear her?
[01:42:00.785 --> 01:42:02.666]  She just said the sky is blue.
[01:42:03.886 --> 01:42:10.569]  She just said, like, if someone stabs an unborn baby and kills it, they should go to jail, but New York just legalized it.
[01:42:10.809 --> 01:42:14.570]  This is upside down, echo chamber, cuckoo land.
[01:42:16.647 --> 01:42:20.990]  Where Caitlin Bennett is out there, her alma mater, saying they're killing babies after they're born.
[01:42:21.371 --> 01:42:23.833]  The governor of Virginia is saying he doesn't back down on it.
[01:42:24.553 --> 01:42:26.615]  Who cares if he wore the stupid black face?
[01:42:26.755 --> 01:42:27.396]  I wouldn't do that.
[01:42:27.436 --> 01:42:28.436]  I think it's distasteful.
[01:42:28.877 --> 01:42:34.181]  But killing babies after they're born is next level!
[01:42:35.302 --> 01:42:36.443]  And it means nothing!
[01:42:38.064 --> 01:42:39.245]  And this is what you pay for.
[01:42:39.265 --> 01:42:41.607]  This is what America... This is how you bring down America.
[01:42:41.627 --> 01:42:43.028]  It's how you bring down a free country.
[01:42:43.248 --> 01:42:44.930]  It's how you undermine a Christian nation.
[01:42:45.922 --> 01:42:46.903]  It's how you conquer people.
[01:42:48.085 --> 01:42:50.608]  Now, I went off half-cocked earlier because I gave them bad directions.
[01:42:50.628 --> 01:42:51.229]  It's all my fault.
[01:42:51.650 --> 01:42:56.957]  When we come back, though, Joe Rogan makes stuff beyond blackface stuff.
[01:42:57.037 --> 01:42:58.419]  I mean, this is next level.
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:42:59.901]  Joe Rogan.
[01:43:00.241 --> 01:43:01.042]  What's gonna happen with this?
[01:43:01.082 --> 01:43:01.643]  Major scandal.
[01:43:06.858 --> 01:43:07.638]  Let's go to Debbie.
[01:43:08.158 --> 01:43:09.159]  Debbie in New Jersey.
[01:43:09.179 --> 01:43:09.959]  Debbie, thanks for calling.
[01:43:09.979 --> 01:43:10.799]  I really appreciate you.
[01:43:11.159 --> 01:43:11.639]  Go ahead, Debbie.
[01:43:11.779 --> 01:43:17.741]  The shifting of Nancy Pelosi with those dentures, I wanted to just slap that bitch right across the mouth.
[01:43:17.841 --> 01:43:19.262]  I'm so sick of her ugly face.
[01:43:19.282 --> 01:43:20.082]  I am too.
[01:43:20.142 --> 01:43:20.922]  God, she's a demon.
[01:43:21.122 --> 01:43:22.683]  It's not about hating them.
[01:43:22.743 --> 01:43:24.383]  For me, it's about, it's embarrassing.
[01:43:24.423 --> 01:43:29.845]  Like, how do we have a group of people this bad, this evil, this stupid ruling over us?
[01:43:30.125 --> 01:43:31.105]  It makes me feel like crap.
[01:43:31.345 --> 01:43:31.946]  You know what, Alex?
[01:43:32.026 --> 01:43:34.948]  It's because we're on such an elevated plane.
[01:43:35.208 --> 01:43:43.075]  The people who are awake, we're so elevated in this dimension that it sickens us and makes us so ill, physically.
[01:43:43.135 --> 01:43:50.301]  It's just, it's so hard to look at people like that and want to even be kind to them because they just turned your frickin' stomach.
[01:43:50.381 --> 01:43:57.327]  But, um, the other thing I wanted to say is, Cortez, she looks like a rabid Austin Terrier with those bulging eyeballs of hers, too.
[01:43:57.868 --> 01:43:58.989]  She really is demonic.
[01:43:59.369 --> 01:44:07.740]  You know, we can laugh about her, and I do, but it's like Beto and that, in his fake voice and how corrupt he is, it's like, this is their superstars?
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:10.943]  Beto O'Rourke and Alexandria Cortez?
[01:44:10.983 --> 01:44:12.185]  These people are idiots!
[01:44:12.666 --> 01:44:14.628]  And I'm not trying to be mean, it's just true!
[01:44:15.829 --> 01:44:16.229]  Yeah, no, it is.
[01:44:16.309 --> 01:44:16.950]  It is.
[01:44:17.090 --> 01:44:24.113]  Alex, I'm going to let you go, but I want to let you know that my husband and I have every t-shirt, every product, because we love you.
[01:44:24.153 --> 01:44:27.174]  We love the Info Warriors and everybody there that works there.
[01:44:27.214 --> 01:44:28.795]  We really think the world of you people.
[01:44:28.935 --> 01:44:31.016]  And we are also lifetime Oath Keepers.
[01:44:31.236 --> 01:44:32.076]  Thank you, Stuart Rose.
[01:44:32.156 --> 01:44:32.576]  We love you.
[01:44:32.596 --> 01:44:32.877]  Thank you.
[01:44:32.897 --> 01:44:33.897]  Well, God bless you, Debbie.
[01:44:34.117 --> 01:44:34.877]  And let me just say this.
[01:44:35.078 --> 01:44:38.799]  I was in meetings this morning with accountants at the lawsuits they've got against us.
[01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:40.580]  And we beat, like, 15 of them.
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:41.820]  So they filed, like, five more.
[01:44:42.841 --> 01:44:44.742]  And I was just looking at this, and it was like,
[01:44:45.928 --> 01:44:50.836]  The enemy turns up the heat, you give us product purchases that just meet the level we need.
[01:44:51.016 --> 01:44:52.298]  We need financial support, folks.
[01:44:52.358 --> 01:44:55.663]  So I need everybody to go to MForestore.com and just realize that it's a war.

[01:47:06.833 --> 01:47:09.435]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:24.292 --> 01:47:25.135]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:47:25.195 --> 01:47:27.641]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:48:03.975]  He rode a blazing saddle He wore a shining star His job to offer battle To Batman near and far He conquered fear and he conquered hate He turned dark night into day He made his blazing saddle A torch to light the way Make no mistake
[01:48:05.407 --> 01:48:07.148]  Infowars is a torch to light the way.
[01:48:07.709 --> 01:48:13.273]  There's fear of the leftists and the globalists.
[01:48:14.193 --> 01:48:16.515]  They'll be censored if you don't lay down to them.
[01:48:17.535 --> 01:48:19.717]  The real fear is laying down and what comes after.
[01:48:21.358 --> 01:48:25.501]  Alright, I don't want to attack my old friend of 21 years, Joe Rogan.
[01:48:27.776 --> 01:48:30.057]  But in the last decade or so, we grew apart.
[01:48:30.557 --> 01:48:31.858]  I didn't go to UFC matches.
[01:48:32.318 --> 01:48:33.699]  Didn't go to most of his comedy shows.
[01:48:33.719 --> 01:48:37.340]  Didn't hang out with him four or five times a year like I've done since 1998.
[01:48:37.761 --> 01:48:38.821]  I might see him once a year.
[01:48:38.861 --> 01:48:40.242]  He might call me a few times a year.
[01:48:40.582 --> 01:48:41.882]  I might call him a few times a year.
[01:48:43.283 --> 01:48:46.665]  And then my listeners told me, why are you saying Joe's a good guy?
[01:48:46.725 --> 01:48:50.647]  He's having all these globalists on, these CIA people on.
[01:48:50.687 --> 01:48:52.367]  He's pushing censorship.
[01:48:53.068 --> 01:48:55.809]  And then, I got sued for Sandy Hook.
[01:48:57.500 --> 01:48:59.120]  Because my listeners questioned the official story.
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:00.561]  The Internet did.
[01:49:01.481 --> 01:49:05.541]  I looked at it and said, I can see how folks think it's staged.
[01:49:05.561 --> 01:49:06.262]  There's some anomalies.
[01:49:06.302 --> 01:49:09.082]  But over the years, I couldn't say definitively.
[01:49:09.102 --> 01:49:10.322]  So I said, OK, the shooting happened.
[01:49:11.722 --> 01:49:16.103]  They're just using the shooting to demonize all gun owners.
[01:49:16.143 --> 01:49:16.743]  And that's wrong.
[01:49:17.483 --> 01:49:26.105]  That's not letting a good crisis go to waste, in the words of Rahm Emanuel, Obama's former chief of staff and the Chicago mayor, who's outgoing.
[01:49:27.694 --> 01:49:35.799]  But then I began to see him with Jack Dorsey on and promoting Square Cash and not explaining that that's his company or that Joe is being sponsored by it.
[01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:43.223]  Or that they're making Bitcoin the main functioning system of that and not the other cryptocurrencies and seeing a global government and a global currency.
[01:49:44.664 --> 01:49:46.265]  So I got critical of Joe about that.
[01:49:47.366 --> 01:49:55.991]  And then I got sent this clip of Joe, this has gotta be five, six years ago, and I'm not even gonna say what's on the tape.
[01:49:57.250 --> 01:49:59.592]  Because corporate media is so deceptive.
[01:50:00.513 --> 01:50:03.817]  Establishment media, they will take what I said and put it out.
[01:50:03.937 --> 01:50:05.779]  He said, well, that's their problem.
[01:50:05.799 --> 01:50:07.040]  Yeah, man, let me tell you something.
[01:50:08.041 --> 01:50:14.808]  I said Hillary was responsible for hundreds of thousands of dead in Libya and the Middle East and tens of thousands of women and children of sex slavery and torture to death.
[01:50:15.208 --> 01:50:18.952]  And Megyn Kelly on Fox edited it in with another tape of me talking about Pizzagate.
[01:50:20.089 --> 01:50:22.269]  And it's in a lawsuit, an edited tape.
[01:50:22.349 --> 01:50:24.070]  Now once we get there, that'll be a big issue.
[01:50:24.130 --> 01:50:27.650]  But I'm talking about Iraq, I'm talking about Syria, I'm talking about Libya.
[01:50:28.050 --> 01:50:29.351]  They edited that in with other tape.
[01:50:29.451 --> 01:50:30.151]  It's crazy!
[01:50:32.871 --> 01:50:35.812]  So I've just learned that I'm not going to say what Joe said here.
[01:50:36.192 --> 01:50:42.293]  I'm going to play what Joe said, and I'm going to make clear, I don't endorse this, but I want to be a thousand percent clear after that.
[01:50:43.633 --> 01:50:44.454]  A trillion percent.
[01:50:45.754 --> 01:50:46.674]  Joe's a comedian.
[01:50:48.769 --> 01:50:50.150]  And Joe is not a racist.
[01:50:51.451 --> 01:50:54.052]  And Joe is a very, very private person.
[01:50:56.473 --> 01:51:02.536]  But I'm going to unleash this controversy because Joe has to see what it's like when things are cherry-picked.
[01:51:05.298 --> 01:51:06.779]  You know, I don't want to get into Joe's private life.
[01:51:11.261 --> 01:51:14.643]  But Joe has raised his wife, who he's had children with, black children.
[01:51:15.824 --> 01:51:16.524]  Joe loves black people.
[01:51:18.416 --> 01:51:20.798]  And overall, he was a very loving person.
[01:51:22.059 --> 01:51:23.059]  He doesn't like racists.
[01:51:23.079 --> 01:51:23.860]  He doesn't like bullies.
[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:24.981]  I think Joe's been a good person.
[01:51:25.341 --> 01:51:26.342]  That's why it's so hurtful.
[01:51:26.402 --> 01:51:29.063]  And no one knows that he has adopted black children.
[01:51:31.465 --> 01:51:32.246]  Doesn't matter, Joe.
[01:51:33.246 --> 01:51:42.293]  If I went on air and said the things you said in a comedy piece, I would be finished.
[01:51:43.456 --> 01:51:48.379]  I had a four-star platinum rating with banks until three months ago.
[01:51:50.159 --> 01:51:52.180]  I had the lowest chargeback for customers.
[01:51:52.321 --> 01:51:53.841]  I had the highest rate.
[01:51:53.981 --> 01:51:58.944]  No one's ever seen somebody that gets charged a percent and a half.
[01:52:06.228 --> 01:52:11.530]  That was because 10 years ago, people tried to order stuff and charge back it to hurt our score.
[01:52:11.550 --> 01:52:12.771]  We just said, we'll eat chargebacks.
[01:52:13.697 --> 01:52:17.319]  We have the highest platinum rating you can get.
[01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:19.141]  Now we have an F rating.
[01:52:19.961 --> 01:52:20.902]  No judge, no jury.
[01:52:20.942 --> 01:52:22.123]  We're getting ready to file lawsuits.
[01:52:23.584 --> 01:52:26.686]  There's a special corporate secret group that puts the designations on.
[01:52:27.246 --> 01:52:29.187]  It's a very serious tortious interference issue.
[01:52:29.207 --> 01:52:30.168]  But imagine that, Joe.
[01:52:30.748 --> 01:52:35.892]  I have perfect credit, perfect corporate credit, perfect banking credit.
[01:52:36.592 --> 01:52:37.033]  Perfect.
[01:52:38.333 --> 01:52:38.654]  Perfect.
[01:52:39.014 --> 01:52:39.754]  Never took a loan.
[01:52:40.255 --> 01:52:41.155]  Five-star everything.
[01:52:41.736 --> 01:52:42.016]  Perfect.
[01:52:43.072 --> 01:52:43.952]  Almost no one has it.
[01:52:44.152 --> 01:52:46.933]  In fact, they believe I may have the most perfect credit ever seen.
[01:52:47.354 --> 01:52:47.694]  Seriously.
[01:52:48.394 --> 01:52:48.994]  It's that sick.
[01:52:52.075 --> 01:52:53.276]  But I'm being unpersoned, Joe.
[01:52:53.296 --> 01:52:53.976]  I'm being destroyed.
[01:52:54.056 --> 01:52:58.698]  And then you sit there and compare black people to Planet of the Apes.
[01:53:01.359 --> 01:53:02.219]  Beyond blackface.
[01:53:03.059 --> 01:53:04.500]  And that's supposedly A-OK.
[01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:06.000]  And look, you're a comedian.
[01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:07.001]  I know you're not a racist.
[01:53:07.681 --> 01:53:08.501]  We're all simian.
[01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:09.802]  I mean, I look like a gorilla.
[01:53:10.799 --> 01:53:12.179]  I was standing there in my clothes off that day.
[01:53:12.199 --> 01:53:13.880]  My wife's like, God, you look like a gorilla.
[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:17.881]  I'm like, yeah, I'm not trying to look like I've got this giant 20-inch neck and this huge chest.
[01:53:18.501 --> 01:53:19.182]  I'm not bragging.
[01:53:19.202 --> 01:53:21.062]  My chest is as big as Schwarzenegger's in his prime.
[01:53:21.122 --> 01:53:21.802]  It's ridiculous.
[01:53:22.162 --> 01:53:23.063]  I look like a gorilla.
[01:53:23.123 --> 01:53:23.923]  I walk like a gorilla.
[01:53:24.143 --> 01:53:25.003]  We're all Simeon.
[01:53:25.043 --> 01:53:27.084]  Of course, white people look like gorillas.
[01:53:27.124 --> 01:53:28.824]  Of course, black people look like gorillas.
[01:53:29.044 --> 01:53:30.245]  But we're in that family.
[01:53:31.445 --> 01:53:33.126]  We're the super IQ super gorilla.
[01:53:34.026 --> 01:53:34.926]  Jacked into God.
[01:53:35.586 --> 01:53:40.228]  But the point is, Joe, you can't have the whole leftist thing and then eat the cake too, bro.
[01:53:41.448 --> 01:53:42.709]  You can't do it, man.
[01:53:45.031 --> 01:53:46.092]  You can't live like that.
[01:53:46.152 --> 01:53:52.598]  You can't judge me and then take out of context what I've done, like you're high and mighty, when this is in your life and this is the thing.
[01:53:52.618 --> 01:53:53.499]  Comedians now know.
[01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:57.843]  They can go back to stuff 10 years old, 20 years old, 25.
[01:53:58.404 --> 01:54:00.185]  I don't like the Governor Northam.
[01:54:00.586 --> 01:54:02.287]  He says kill babies after they're born.
[01:54:02.327 --> 01:54:02.948]  That's why I hate him.
[01:54:04.326 --> 01:54:08.127]  But what do you think went on in the South 25, 27, 30 years ago in Democrats?
[01:54:08.507 --> 01:54:09.807]  Of course they dress up like that!
[01:54:10.367 --> 01:54:11.167]  That's all they do!
[01:54:12.628 --> 01:54:19.289]  One time I got invited to a Halloween party, and I showed up like 10 years ago and it was all white people dressed up like black people.
[01:54:20.429 --> 01:54:21.930]  They said, oh it's just fun, we're having fun.
[01:54:21.970 --> 01:54:23.150]  I said, I'm getting out of here, man.
[01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:27.391]  Because I don't want to have some celebration thinking I'm better than somebody.
[01:54:27.931 --> 01:54:30.691]  Like if I saw blacks making fun of white people, I'd say you're a bunch of damn racists.
[01:54:31.191 --> 01:54:31.832]  I'm sick of it!
[01:54:32.132 --> 01:54:33.432]  I believe in Martin Luther King.
[01:54:35.854 --> 01:54:38.796]  I believe in what people stand for and what they do is how they're judged.
[01:54:40.556 --> 01:54:41.457]  Not off what color they are.
[01:54:41.737 --> 01:54:44.458]  And all this anti-white racism crap, I stand against it.
[01:54:45.239 --> 01:54:52.823]  But let me tell you, if I said what Joe said, he was all for my deplatforming before and now he's under the heat.
[01:54:52.843 --> 01:54:54.144]  He's like, well, leave Alex alone.
[01:54:54.224 --> 01:54:55.124]  Hey, fine, great Joe.
[01:54:55.544 --> 01:54:56.785]  I'm just letting you know something.
[01:54:58.456 --> 01:55:01.937]  That I know you're not a racist, and I know you do comedy because you think it's funny.
[01:55:02.277 --> 01:55:11.920]  Your interracial jokes, which are true, like most of the interracial porn gets bought in the South, and plenty of your older jokes about, oh, look at that, that white woman, oh, that's funny stuff, man.
[01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:20.462]  And I agree, comedy should be comedy, but the left wants to project racism on everything, and you want to cuddle up to it, so feel what it's like, Joe.
[01:55:23.383 --> 01:55:28.064]  Here's Joe talking about going to see Planet of the Apes movie, and then he gets in a black neighborhood,
[01:55:29.977 --> 01:55:31.238]  Well, just hear it for yourself, Hurtus.
[01:55:31.978 --> 01:55:33.319]  There's Planet of the Apes, man.
[01:55:33.339 --> 01:55:34.399]  We're gonna go see Planet of the Apes.
[01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:37.761]  So I look on the iPhone app, and it says, OK, take me to this one.
[01:55:38.122 --> 01:55:39.903]  And the guy goes, OK, is that in a good neighborhood?
[01:55:39.923 --> 01:55:41.323]  He's like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:55:41.483 --> 01:55:42.444]  Guy barely speaks English.
[01:55:42.864 --> 01:55:43.605]  He takes us there.
[01:55:43.845 --> 01:55:45.206]  We get out, and we're giggling.
[01:55:45.226 --> 01:55:46.466]  Ooh, we're gonna go see Planet of the Apes.
[01:55:46.566 --> 01:55:48.647]  We walk into Planet of the Apes.
[01:55:49.648 --> 01:55:51.109]  We walked into Africa, dude.
[01:55:52.169 --> 01:55:55.451]  We walked in the door, and there was no white people.
[01:55:55.611 --> 01:55:56.452]  There was no white people.
[01:55:58.570 --> 01:56:01.091]  Joe Rogan just said black people are apes.
[01:56:05.553 --> 01:56:08.194]  Well, I guess, what's the in-between size?
[01:56:08.254 --> 01:56:11.915]  Mesomorphs, like we got big muscles, we're like, got big torsos, short legs.
[01:56:11.976 --> 01:56:18.518]  I mean, I, I mean, there's some black people, like Joe's saying, look like me and look like an ape.
[01:56:18.538 --> 01:56:19.879]  There's some that are super tall and don't.
[01:56:20.279 --> 01:56:23.240]  The point is there's white people look like that, because we are simian.
[01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:25.061]  But the point is, is that
[01:56:26.388 --> 01:56:34.474]  You can't sit there and say, I went to a black neighborhood on my iPhone app, and I was implanted with the apes, saying black people are apes.
[01:56:35.195 --> 01:56:42.700]  Joe Rogan just said black people are apes, just like Watson, the former head of the Cold Springs Harbor Group, said blacks aren't human, they're apes.
[01:56:45.302 --> 01:56:47.704]  Well, if they're apes, then how can we breed with them, Joe?
[01:56:49.105 --> 01:56:50.967]  And are you saying your daughter is an ape?
[01:56:52.368 --> 01:56:55.030]  Hey man, it's you up on your sanctimonious hours here, bro.
[01:56:57.449 --> 01:56:58.730]  Quite frankly, I am like an ape.
[01:56:59.650 --> 01:57:00.971]  I can pull somebody's head off.
[01:57:01.571 --> 01:57:02.632]  I've got ape-like strength.
[01:57:04.573 --> 01:57:07.475]  I beat some big ol' black guy's asses, too, thought they could kick my ass.
[01:57:07.515 --> 01:57:08.836]  They found out who the real ape was.
[01:57:09.356 --> 01:57:10.357]  I'm King Kong, baby.
[01:57:10.697 --> 01:57:12.538]  I'm not ashamed of my simian nature.
[01:57:13.279 --> 01:57:20.423]  But you can't sit there and pull crap like that and say crap like that in a glass house
[01:57:25.278 --> 01:57:30.181]  And basically, I mean, you heard him, jeez.
[01:57:33.744 --> 01:57:34.344]  Snake Farm.
[01:57:35.925 --> 01:57:36.766]  Just damn nasty.
[01:57:38.167 --> 01:57:38.827]  So there you go.
[01:57:39.107 --> 01:57:43.671]  Joe Rogan says black people look like apes, and black neighborhoods are planted with apes.
[01:57:43.691 --> 01:57:43.991]  You heard it.
[01:58:02.472 --> 01:58:09.503]  We are offering our best-selling product, Brainforce Plus, the amazing nootropic for focus, energy, intelligence, you name it.
[01:58:09.523 --> 01:58:10.744]  It's just amazing.
[01:58:10.985 --> 01:58:11.786]  It's 50% off.
[01:58:11.806 --> 01:58:13.128]  That is a massive discount.
[01:58:13.168 --> 01:58:18.296]  But I've got to stop this sale, even though it's been very successful, because we're running low on Brainforce Plus.
[01:58:18.536 --> 01:58:22.698]  Now it's 50% off coupled in a combo with TurboForce at 33% off.
[01:58:22.878 --> 01:58:25.139]  So the two together are a massive savings.
[01:58:25.259 --> 01:58:32.022]  Now BrainForce is a nootropic for the brain and leading competitors are 2-3 times more with similar ingredients.
[01:58:32.062 --> 01:58:35.304]  This is the best ingredients out there at the lowest price.
[01:58:36.104 --> 01:58:37.886]  You couple it with TurboForce.
[01:58:38.146 --> 01:58:39.227]  I don't even know what to call it.
[01:58:39.307 --> 01:58:40.208]  Is it a pre-workout?
[01:58:40.308 --> 01:58:41.449]  Is it long-lasting energy?
[01:58:41.469 --> 01:58:42.610]  Is it next-level energy drink?
[01:58:42.650 --> 01:58:43.330]  That's what it all is.
[01:58:43.490 --> 01:58:45.252]  It's healthy, long-lasting energy.
[01:58:45.392 --> 01:58:51.837]  Clean-burning, with all the different types of naturally occurring energy, with the amino acids, with the vitamins, the minerals, and so much more.
[01:58:51.878 --> 01:58:53.439]  It's TurboForce, comes in packets.
[01:58:53.699 --> 01:58:57.202]  I suggest you only take half a packet the first time you take it.
[01:58:57.322 --> 01:58:59.264]  And if you take it with BrainForce, they go together great.
[01:58:59.304 --> 01:59:01.766]  Just be careful, because it's really, really strong.
[01:59:01.886 --> 01:59:05.570]  The great part about it is most people take energy drinks, last 2-3 hours, you crash from it.
[01:59:05.590 --> 01:59:09.154]  Most folks respond to this saying 10 hours of energy with no crash.
[01:59:09.334 --> 01:59:12.198]  Everybody's metabolic system is different, so experience it yourself.
[01:59:12.218 --> 01:59:12.898]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:59:13.139 --> 01:59:16.523]  These products together are at the lowest price ever.
[01:59:17.703 --> 01:59:19.524]  33% off by itself for TurboForce.
[01:59:20.244 --> 01:59:21.845]  33% off with a BrainForce.
[01:59:21.965 --> 01:59:23.765]  BrainForce is 50% off when you combo it.
[01:59:23.805 --> 01:59:25.126]  That is an amazing deal.
[01:59:25.166 --> 01:59:31.808]  Go to m4warslife.com to specifically find the sub page for the combo set, or go to m4warsstore.com, that is the umbrella site.

[01:59:39.791 --> 01:59:40.411]  Check it out today.
[01:59:54.867 --> 02:00:00.833]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:06.239 --> 02:00:08.481]  I'm no stranger to the rain
[02:00:16.638 --> 02:00:25.184]  You know, species means you can have sex with somebody and you have a baby.
[02:00:25.745 --> 02:00:27.946]  Who can then have babies?
[02:00:46.949 --> 02:00:52.673]  You can have a horse and a mule, they can have sex, they can't have babies.
[02:00:54.834 --> 02:00:59.397]  You can have a horse and a donkey have sex, and they have a mule.
[02:01:01.038 --> 02:01:03.679]  It's a hybrid, the species is so close, but it can't have a baby.
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:08.402]  So I'm gonna tag this on when we post this to Infowars.com, the last Joe Rogan video.
[02:01:08.803 --> 02:01:11.885]  I don't take pleasure in going after Joe Rogan.
[02:01:12.878 --> 02:01:26.922]  But he wants to sit up there and sanctimoniously say that Nazi collaborator George Soros was a victim of the Nazis when he went on 60 Minutes at NPR and said it was happy-making, best time of his life, exhilarating.
[02:01:27.282 --> 02:01:28.362]  These are quotes, Joe!
[02:01:30.883 --> 02:01:32.384]  He's funding the Nazi EU.
[02:01:34.484 --> 02:01:35.865]  And then, let's play the clip again.
[02:01:35.885 --> 02:01:36.745]  He says...
[02:01:39.073 --> 02:01:41.976]  Six, seven years ago on his Apple app, he's going to see Planet of the Apes.
[02:01:42.036 --> 02:01:43.737]  It directs him to this good neighborhood.
[02:01:43.997 --> 02:01:45.518]  So it's very elitist, too.
[02:01:45.579 --> 02:01:47.320]  Like, oh, I want a good neighborhood.
[02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:47.940]  It says it's a good place.
[02:01:48.001 --> 02:01:50.122]  And I go, and it's black people.
[02:01:53.885 --> 02:01:56.628]  And it's Planet of the Apes.
[02:01:58.251 --> 02:02:03.515]  Well, if you think about apes, you've got apes with pink skin, brown skin, black skin.
[02:02:03.995 --> 02:02:04.776]  They're not humans.
[02:02:05.616 --> 02:02:07.678]  And those ape species can't make babies together.
[02:02:07.998 --> 02:02:09.499]  We're our own amazing species.
[02:02:15.703 --> 02:02:22.228]  And the genetics of a white person versus a black person aren't even 1% different.
[02:02:29.352 --> 02:02:31.874]  And my issue is, it doesn't matter.
[02:02:32.434 --> 02:02:34.336]  Asians, on average, can't process alcohol.
[02:02:35.957 --> 02:02:37.658]  Asians have different structures of their spine.
[02:02:37.998 --> 02:02:38.819]  Humans are different.
[02:02:38.879 --> 02:02:40.380]  We are a diverging species.
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:41.941]  But we're still the same species.
[02:02:46.984 --> 02:02:49.586]  And I'm not some virtue-signaler here who's guilty to be white.
[02:02:51.668 --> 02:02:55.891]  Being a Northern European, I am endowed, on average,
[02:02:57.247 --> 02:02:59.748]  With the highest IQ of any group of people on the planet.
[02:03:03.370 --> 02:03:05.811]  Now that doesn't mean on a curve, Dr. McCamp shot please.
[02:03:07.072 --> 02:03:08.333]  You know on these bell curves they do.
[02:03:09.233 --> 02:03:15.656]  That doesn't mean that on average white people or Japanese are right up there, have the highest IQ.
[02:03:17.257 --> 02:03:19.118]  It doesn't mean there aren't black people that are up there too.
[02:03:19.158 --> 02:03:22.820]  It means on average there are more Japanese and more whites that are on that curve.
[02:03:24.062 --> 02:03:27.063]  And people can say, well, or Russians, or whoever you want to say.
[02:03:27.483 --> 02:03:29.124]  Use it or say, well, that's the test.
[02:03:29.184 --> 02:03:29.884]  It doesn't matter.
[02:03:30.144 --> 02:03:32.044]  Where are people making spaceships and computers?
[02:03:34.605 --> 02:03:35.225]  It's in the West.
[02:03:35.886 --> 02:03:40.807]  But that isn't meaning that we hate black people.
[02:03:42.108 --> 02:03:45.289]  Because there are black people, statistically, that are as smart as anybody on the planet.
[02:03:46.269 --> 02:03:52.731]  It means, on average, whites have the highest IQ.
[02:03:54.494 --> 02:03:55.235]  On average.
[02:03:57.176 --> 02:04:03.922]  Well, you better have an IQ if you were spending hundreds of thousands of years in frozen wasteland at the top of the planet.
[02:04:04.162 --> 02:04:08.986]  Because if you went to bed, if you got back in your cave 10 minutes too late, you were dead in a doornail.
[02:04:09.966 --> 02:04:22.757]  In Africa and other areas in the equatorial regions, it was about how strong you were, how fast you were, how cunning you were.
[02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:26.362]  Not about long-term strategic thinking.
[02:04:28.964 --> 02:04:36.370]  So when I sit here and I criticize Joe for calling black people apes, dude, we are apes.
[02:04:38.031 --> 02:04:38.831]  And I know you know that.
[02:04:40.353 --> 02:04:43.015]  It doesn't mean we're not divine and God made us in the image, there's other things.
[02:04:43.395 --> 02:04:49.600]  The point is, is that you get away with that when it's not even accurate.
[02:04:50.495 --> 02:04:51.836]  And people don't call you on that?
[02:04:52.537 --> 02:04:55.059]  But at the same time then, let's not hate white people.
[02:04:56.740 --> 02:05:02.525]  Let's thank white people for electricity and airplanes and medicine.
[02:05:05.347 --> 02:05:07.488]  At its regular price, it's a little over $3.
[02:05:08.429 --> 02:05:11.591]  When we have it discounted, it's about $2.50 a piece.
[02:05:13.332 --> 02:05:16.935]  Comparable bars are between $5 and $7 a piece at Whole Foods.
[02:05:17.315 --> 02:05:18.055]  This is high-end.
[02:05:18.716 --> 02:05:21.938]  When you get one box, you get them at basically $3.
[02:05:21.978 --> 02:05:26.061]  You get them for $2.50 or so when you get it at the current launch discount.
[02:05:26.681 --> 02:05:35.108]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturing developer in the country to get it all ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this.
[02:05:35.568 --> 02:05:37.770]  It's available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:38.370]  It's simple.
[02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:43.995]  You get the highest quality protein bars in two different flavors and you fund the war against the globalists.
[02:05:44.515 --> 02:05:46.536]  And the attempt that we're engaged in to take the country back.
[02:05:46.876 --> 02:05:47.297]  It's simple.
[02:05:47.797 --> 02:05:53.460]  Go shop with the good guys at Infowarsstore.com and break the back of the globalists and get high quality, super discounts.
[02:05:53.760 --> 02:06:00.744]  Or keep shopping with Jeff Bezos and Amazon and keep going to Whole Foods that are actually funding the Washington Post and the globalists' attempt to destroy this country.
[02:06:01.104 --> 02:06:01.644]  It's that simple.

[02:06:14.167 --> 02:06:17.509]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:06:18.250 --> 02:06:20.852]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:24.835 --> 02:06:28.677]  Four out of five Catholic priests are gay.
[02:06:28.697 --> 02:06:32.220]  So, homosexuals make up
[02:06:34.633 --> 02:06:36.795]  3% of the population, and I don't hate anybody.
[02:06:37.355 --> 02:06:38.556]  I don't judge anybody.
[02:06:39.477 --> 02:06:39.757]  Okay?
[02:06:39.797 --> 02:06:41.138]  I've been on the earth 45 years.
[02:06:41.318 --> 02:06:42.258]  I've seen some things.
[02:06:42.699 --> 02:06:43.479]  I've done some things.
[02:06:43.839 --> 02:06:44.880]  I'm not judging anybody.
[02:06:46.901 --> 02:06:51.644]  I mean, I've paid for abortions back when I was a teenager, and I've repented to God for it, been fighting ever since.
[02:06:52.145 --> 02:06:54.026]  I've killed my children.
[02:06:55.607 --> 02:06:57.448]  I think on a scale of 1 to 10, that's like a 7.
[02:06:58.409 --> 02:06:59.569]  You know, two dudes together is like a 3.
[02:07:00.939 --> 02:07:06.782]  I'm not judging anybody, but I'm telling you the realization of what's right and what's wrong is important.
[02:07:07.563 --> 02:07:09.044]  London Guardian article.
[02:07:09.784 --> 02:07:11.605]  One out of five Vatican priests gay.
[02:07:13.906 --> 02:07:20.550]  So what happens is you get a system where no women are allowed, where the family isn't there, and this is what it's going to draw.
[02:07:20.570 --> 02:07:23.232]  A giant bathhouse.
[02:07:25.813 --> 02:07:27.954]  And then you have the blackmail.
[02:07:27.974 --> 02:07:28.775]  But let me tell you something.
[02:07:28.855 --> 02:07:30.216]  I know who Leo Zagami was.
[02:07:31.783 --> 02:07:32.264]  15 years ago.
[02:07:34.025 --> 02:07:40.729]  And the only reason I knew who he was, it was like all over the internet, he's a liar, he's bad, he's evil, he's this, he's that.
[02:07:40.749 --> 02:07:43.891]  And then about eight years ago, I read, I can't remember, a couple of his books.
[02:07:43.911 --> 02:07:45.492]  He's written 15 books or something.
[02:07:45.852 --> 02:07:47.193]  He can correct me if I'm wrong, but a lot of them.
[02:07:47.774 --> 02:07:50.816]  And I was like, well, there's going to be a Jesuit black pope.
[02:07:50.896 --> 02:07:56.179]  And then like six, seven years ago, it's going to be the current pope out of South America.
[02:07:56.199 --> 02:07:58.521]  And he's going to use pedophilia, blackmail to get in control.
[02:07:59.583 --> 02:08:01.987]  And Pope Francis, and then it all came true.
[02:08:02.748 --> 02:08:04.711]  And then, there's HD video of this.
[02:08:04.731 --> 02:08:06.373]  We never made a film, we got so busy we put it out.
[02:08:06.633 --> 02:08:07.214]  YouTube deleted it.
[02:08:07.474 --> 02:08:08.436]  Got like 5 million views.
[02:08:09.197 --> 02:08:10.419]  I met the Vatican with him.
[02:08:11.482 --> 02:08:13.423]  And his book is Lightning Striking the Vatican.
[02:08:14.064 --> 02:08:17.466]  And we're there, and they've got the secret police there and everything, and I've already gone to the Vatican.
[02:08:17.746 --> 02:08:19.467]  He's taking me in castles and showing me all the secrets.
[02:08:19.827 --> 02:08:21.428]  All of a sudden, this storm appears out of nowhere.
[02:08:21.508 --> 02:08:23.869]  And my wife was there, then-girlfriend.
[02:08:23.889 --> 02:08:25.110]  She was like, is this a movie?
[02:08:25.730 --> 02:08:29.152]  It was like boiling blue clouds and lightning striking.
[02:08:29.172 --> 02:08:29.853]  And it's on video.
[02:08:30.353 --> 02:08:31.053]  We've got it somewhere.
[02:08:31.093 --> 02:08:32.554]  We should re-upload it because YouTube took it down.
[02:08:32.875 --> 02:08:33.455]  Five million views.
[02:08:36.448 --> 02:08:39.809]  And then Zegami off record took me to a bunch of castles and secret society stuff.
[02:08:39.849 --> 02:08:42.889]  He's been in the real Illuminati and came out of it and exposed it.
[02:08:43.709 --> 02:08:46.810]  And so let me tell you, back then I was like, okay, this sounds crazy.
[02:08:47.070 --> 02:08:49.270]  This guy, nobody's more accurate than Leo Zegami.
[02:08:50.591 --> 02:08:56.752]  And then he said, the deputy Pope, the Pope's best friend in Australia, he's the main runner of thousands of kids.
[02:08:56.792 --> 02:08:59.812]  He gets arrested for kidnapping over a hundred kids, secret trial.
[02:08:59.832 --> 02:09:01.873]  So I'm telling you, you're Leo Zegami, folks.
[02:09:01.993 --> 02:09:03.813]  This is not talk.
[02:09:06.092 --> 02:09:22.938]  This is somebody who comes from an aristocratic family, friends with Berlusconi, he knows what he's talking about, and he can really tell you what's going on, because now, again, the pedophiles take over the Vatican, because I'm not here saying Catholics are evil or have been bad in oral history, it's a complex organization.
[02:09:23.298 --> 02:09:23.778]  It's like anything.
[02:09:25.079 --> 02:09:27.579]  Like Oliver Cromwell started out good and turned out bad.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.040]  Things are complex, but
[02:09:30.407 --> 02:09:32.369]  This hasn't been a reformation of the Catholic Church.
[02:09:32.389 --> 02:09:45.060]  This has been a takeover by the true Satanists who want to blaspheme in the church, like Pennsylvania where they, you know, ten priests have sex with an eight-year-old boy and give him the sacrament, you know, in his mouth and his rear end.
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:46.862]  I don't want to be gross here with a family audience.
[02:09:46.882 --> 02:09:49.404]  This is Satanism is about blasphemy.
[02:09:50.632 --> 02:09:57.514]  And so now they use the Satanism to blackmail and get control, but now it's undermining it as well because they can't stop blackmailing each other.
[02:09:57.914 --> 02:10:05.897]  And Leo Zegami joins us because he's got gay drama explodes in Vatican as Pope Francis prepares to defrock Archbishop McCracken.
[02:10:06.417 --> 02:10:09.178]  So joining us is Leo Zegami of leozegami.com.
[02:10:09.198 --> 02:10:12.639]  I'm not going to go over his whole bio, it would take hours, but let me tell you.
[02:10:13.059 --> 02:10:14.339]  You want somebody who's got their pulse.
[02:10:14.359 --> 02:10:15.720]  I don't do this for many guests, I'm telling you.
[02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:20.355]  This guy has got his pulse on what's happening.
[02:10:20.375 --> 02:10:21.198]  Leo, thanks for joining us.
[02:10:22.489 --> 02:10:24.790]  Hello Alex, it's always a pleasure to be with you.
[02:10:25.471 --> 02:10:47.684]  I am afraid that we are all being persecuted, me included, but we are here to report on the latest scandal which is hitting the Vatican very hard and it's basically Archbishop Michael soon to be defrocked, so he's basically going to go back to the state of a normal human being without the protection of the Vatican, but at this point
[02:10:48.244 --> 02:10:59.286]  There is a coup d'etat in the Vatican because his lover, who is still in control, Cardinal Farrer, decides that maybe they should not totally defraud.
[02:10:59.346 --> 02:11:05.107]  I mean, there is a lot of tension going on right while we are talking in these hours, Alex.
[02:11:05.147 --> 02:11:06.027]  This is current.
[02:11:06.107 --> 02:11:08.568]  It's not even breaking news on the media.
[02:11:08.908 --> 02:11:15.889]  I mean, everybody is waiting for Pope Francis to defraud Archbishop McCarrick, but in the meantime, of course, Cardinal Farrer
[02:11:16.297 --> 02:11:20.804]  Who is responsible for the biggest study of family and life.
[02:11:21.546 --> 02:11:24.150]  And this guy was living with me carry.
[02:11:24.170 --> 02:11:26.413]  I mean, it's not just the guy who was living.
[02:11:26.474 --> 02:11:28.998]  They were living in the same flat for seven years.
[02:11:30.288 --> 02:11:40.212]  And all this basically brings us to the decadence of this Catholic Church that we have been talking about for many years.
[02:11:40.252 --> 02:11:42.592]  By the way, I don't get into the Virgin Mary on pastries and things.
[02:11:42.612 --> 02:11:43.013]  You don't either.
[02:11:43.493 --> 02:11:44.973]  I'm at Rome for a week.
[02:11:45.433 --> 02:11:46.474]  I meet you the day before.
[02:11:46.494 --> 02:11:46.994]  I meet you the next day.
[02:11:47.034 --> 02:11:47.794]  We go to the Vatican.
[02:11:47.814 --> 02:11:48.535]  There's no rain.
[02:11:48.835 --> 02:11:49.795]  You're talking for 30 minutes.
[02:11:49.895 --> 02:11:50.755]  Clouds appear.
[02:11:51.056 --> 02:11:55.337]  And just like your book, lightning strikes it for only the second time you've seen while we're there.
[02:11:55.377 --> 02:11:56.197]  We have video of this.
[02:11:56.477 --> 02:11:56.798]  What was that?
[02:11:59.468 --> 02:12:03.930]  Well, Alex, in the Vatican there is a lot of black magic and a lot of magic.
[02:12:04.290 --> 02:12:09.453]  This is a holy place since ancient Rome, even before the Vatican came along.
[02:12:09.933 --> 02:12:15.496]  Energies manifest very strong right there where we were in front of that obelisk.
[02:12:15.756 --> 02:12:17.837]  There is some very powerful energies.
[02:12:17.857 --> 02:12:21.999]  So... If I go back, what was the cult that was there out in the swamps with the Romans?
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:26.762]  Well, there was the Mithraic cult back then.
[02:12:27.859 --> 02:12:32.662]  Yes, they had their own cave there and they, of course, made the sacrifices.
[02:12:33.322 --> 02:12:42.327]  The thing is that the church has been hijacked by Satanists in 1963, officially, when they celebrated the Black Mass right inside the Vatican.
[02:12:42.807 --> 02:12:47.490]  I mean, that was the moment in which... Let's explain.
[02:12:47.550 --> 02:12:49.451]  Satan loves the rituals in the church.
[02:12:49.511 --> 02:12:49.971]  Explain that.
[02:12:51.141 --> 02:13:07.074]  Yes, well, at that point there was Ratzinger, who was not yet, of course, Pope Ratzinger, but he was an important figure already, as somebody who was celebrating the Mass with other key figures of
[02:13:07.694 --> 02:13:11.336]  The Roman Black Aristocracy and of the Church.
[02:13:11.736 --> 02:13:24.723]  I mean, these people really enthroned Satan and from then on they started a new satanic era that will manifest with the visit of the Pope to New York for the first time.
[02:13:24.743 --> 02:13:26.184]  The Pope goes to New York.
[02:13:26.764 --> 02:13:32.612]  And it's even in Rosemary's Baby's film, this citation of the Pope being in New York at one point.
[02:13:33.093 --> 02:13:36.577]  Ratzinger now is... Exactly.
[02:13:36.617 --> 02:13:37.739]  So now, here's the question.
[02:13:37.799 --> 02:13:38.860]  Now they're in crisis.
[02:13:39.401 --> 02:13:43.266]  Am I right to say the blackmail they use to get full control is now threatening them?
[02:13:43.326 --> 02:13:43.887]  Is that accurate?
[02:13:45.427 --> 02:13:49.031]  Well, of course, they're all blackmailing each other because they don't know how to get out of it.
[02:13:49.091 --> 02:14:02.164]  I mean, the fact that in the last 24 hours we've been waiting for this announcement of defrocking of Archibishop McCarrick is symptomatic of the fact that Archibishop McCarrick is one of the key people in the U.S.
[02:14:02.184 --> 02:14:03.706]  to run the pedophile rings.
[02:14:03.726 --> 02:14:06.148]  And we'll cover that next segment, but let me ask you this.
[02:14:06.889 --> 02:14:12.431]  Just a few months ago you said Pope Francis will stop the pedophile investigation in the U.S.
[02:14:12.791 --> 02:14:15.312]  He indeed did that and almost had no news coverage.
[02:14:15.332 --> 02:14:15.852]  What happened there?
[02:14:17.113 --> 02:14:24.135]  Well, he used the excuse of calling on all the cardinals to Rome for the end of this month.
[02:14:24.256 --> 02:14:36.080]  So now we are about to encounter the biggest event in recent Vatican history from the 20th of February when there will be this synod on the abuse of minors.
[02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:54.744]  And then, at that point, on the 25th and 26th, instead, there will be a workshop on robotics, which is the preparatory stage of the 2020 Artificial Intelligence meeting in the Vatican, in which Cyber-Satan will be officially born.
[02:14:55.825 --> 02:15:01.546]  Which is what Revelation says will be like this 25-foot projection of Antichrist, the beast that's seen everywhere.
[02:15:02.918 --> 02:15:08.682]  Yes, and of course the mark of the beast, the microchipping, will be imposed by the robots.
[02:15:09.062 --> 02:15:17.787]  That's why Abu Dhabi's experimentation with the robocops has been so important, and that's why the Pope went there to kickstart Islam.
[02:15:18.067 --> 02:15:21.169]  And let's be clear, you're an expert on Islam because you infiltrated it.
[02:15:21.569 --> 02:15:25.472]  When we come back, the globalists admit they don't want humans that will question orders.
[02:15:25.932 --> 02:15:29.394]  That's why they're already putting trans people in the military, all of it, to kill morale.
[02:15:29.735 --> 02:15:31.916]  The age of the machines is here because they'll follow orders.
[02:15:33.288 --> 02:15:38.309]  Absolutely, and they have to be blind orders, because they're gonna be knocking on your door and say, are you a microchip?
[02:15:38.349 --> 02:15:38.970]  Yes or no?
[02:15:39.490 --> 02:15:40.770]  That's it.
[02:15:41.390 --> 02:15:45.552]  Yeah, pull-up China has its new killer bots, that if you don't have the chip, they kill you.
[02:15:45.572 --> 02:15:46.292]  That's mainstream news.
[02:15:46.312 --> 02:15:49.293]  You take a chip in China, and if you don't, the robot kills you.
[02:15:49.333 --> 02:15:53.774]  Little drones, little helicopters with grenade launchers and shotguns.
[02:15:55.434 --> 02:15:55.875]  You don't have it?
[02:15:55.895 --> 02:15:58.175]  We'll be right back with Leo Zagami.
[02:15:58.215 --> 02:16:00.496]  The antichrist is about to be born upon us.
[02:16:02.199 --> 02:16:02.859]  Know someone?

[02:17:47.606 --> 02:18:00.756]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[02:18:16.638 --> 02:18:27.770]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[02:18:29.011 --> 02:18:30.673]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[02:18:30.933 --> 02:18:33.616]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[02:18:34.957 --> 02:18:38.738]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[02:18:39.298 --> 02:18:43.219]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[02:18:43.559 --> 02:18:45.580]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:47.321]  This country is in a war!
[02:18:48.141 --> 02:18:58.204]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[02:18:58.844 --> 02:19:02.425]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[02:19:02.861 --> 02:19:04.002]  Defeat the globalists.
[02:19:04.542 --> 02:19:05.703]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:19:06.263 --> 02:19:07.324]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[02:19:07.764 --> 02:19:08.885]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:19:09.806 --> 02:19:14.069]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:19:14.709 --> 02:19:17.931]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:19:18.532 --> 02:19:26.578]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:19:27.518 --> 02:19:29.919]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[02:19:30.299 --> 02:19:36.881]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[02:19:37.561 --> 02:19:41.463]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[02:19:41.523 --> 02:19:47.424]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[02:19:47.485 --> 02:19:50.305]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[02:19:50.505 --> 02:19:51.746]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:19:52.006 --> 02:19:55.047]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment!
[02:19:57.678 --> 02:19:59.580]  There's a need for a new world order.
[02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:02.122]  But it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[02:20:27.140 --> 02:20:33.389]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:55.794 --> 02:20:59.018]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host for broadcasting worldwide.
[02:20:59.038 --> 02:21:00.799]  Leo Zagami from Rome is our guest.
[02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:04.263]  Please don't forget, we have amazing products.
[02:21:04.363 --> 02:21:10.169]  Whatever the best supplements are, whatever the best water filtration, air filtration, we go out and get the best and then discount it.
[02:21:10.270 --> 02:21:13.173]  And then those are regular purchases you already need to make.
[02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:18.191]  You make those purchases, and it funds the operation.
[02:21:18.691 --> 02:21:20.891]  MFullWorksStore.com, MFullWorksLife.com.
[02:21:21.631 --> 02:21:25.712]  The average super high-end protein bar is $5 to $7.
[02:21:26.793 --> 02:21:34.574]  We went out to the top firms, made the best 15 grams of protein, super tasty, and regular sales price is $3 per bar.
[02:21:35.014 --> 02:21:37.115]  They're discounted right now out of the gates at $2.40.

[02:21:40.516 --> 02:21:42.356]  We've got MFullWorksLife Protein Bar.
[02:21:43.891 --> 02:21:46.652]  Amazing vanilla coconut, 12 come in a pack.
[02:21:47.253 --> 02:21:48.373]  You get something you already need.
[02:21:48.433 --> 02:21:50.954]  Mill replacement, super high quality, on the go.
[02:21:51.414 --> 02:21:53.435]  Fund the information war.
[02:21:53.995 --> 02:21:56.076]  We also have peanut butter and chocolate.
[02:21:57.777 --> 02:21:59.098]  These are the best.
[02:21:59.698 --> 02:22:01.299]  These are the highest quality.
[02:22:01.719 --> 02:22:04.120]  These are the very best we can bring you.
[02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:05.881]  I mean, take Brain Force Plus.
[02:22:06.621 --> 02:22:07.581]  Take Brain Force Plus.
[02:22:07.601 --> 02:22:10.783]  We went and looked at three top national
[02:22:12.918 --> 02:22:13.839]  Neutropics for the brain.
[02:22:14.661 --> 02:22:17.024]  And then said, let's just soup them up and make it cheaper.
[02:22:17.345 --> 02:22:19.188]  Because they're marketing up five to seven times.
[02:22:19.829 --> 02:22:21.331]  We market up 150%.
[02:22:22.413 --> 02:22:23.033]  We discount at 50%.
[02:22:23.134 --> 02:22:26.619]  If people like to see a discount on there, I'll give you what you want.
[02:22:26.639 --> 02:22:27.620]  You're already getting a great deal.
[02:22:28.914 --> 02:22:30.916]  That's 50% off right now, Brain Force Plus.
[02:22:30.936 --> 02:22:32.497]  That ends this week because we're running low.
[02:22:32.517 --> 02:22:36.740]  It will be two more months until we get more in, so I'm going to go back to regular price starting next Monday.
[02:22:37.101 --> 02:22:47.249]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139 is the toll-free number to call, 888-253-3139.
[02:22:48.089 --> 02:22:52.653]  Going back to Leo Zagami, best-selling author, researcher, lives in Rome, leozagami.com.
[02:22:53.274 --> 02:22:55.856]  Look, you're getting into all the facts, all the issues, all the people.
[02:22:56.396 --> 02:22:57.357]  You literally
[02:22:59.169 --> 02:23:07.312]  15 years ago when I first read your work, 10 years ago when I first started having you on, you were so confident, you laid it all out, it all came true.
[02:23:07.372 --> 02:23:09.133]  So let me ask you this.
[02:23:10.433 --> 02:23:11.573]  Or have you lost your crystal ball?
[02:23:11.773 --> 02:23:13.154]  And I'm saying sometimes I have as well.
[02:23:13.834 --> 02:23:15.635]  What's coming next, Leo Zagami?
[02:23:18.516 --> 02:23:23.837]  There is a connection that I found out which will explain where we're going next.
[02:23:26.438 --> 02:23:28.039]  Hello?
[02:23:31.853 --> 02:23:47.300]  Okay, there is a direct connection that will explain where we are going in the future because I found this incredible link between the Jesuits, Cardinal Parolin, the Secretary of State,
[02:23:48.075 --> 02:24:07.323]  They are Giorgio Bassi from the Academy of the Illuminati, John Podesta and Moscow, and a particular office in Moscow of this group that wants to dominate the world, which is called the International Organization for the Destinies of the World, behind the real Russian collusion.
[02:24:07.884 --> 02:24:17.368]  They are the ones who are plotting for the return in power of people from the Democratic Party that they have always worked with.
[02:24:18.172 --> 02:24:25.895]  And of course, where we're going is towards a demonic situation in which the artificial intelligence takes over.
[02:24:25.935 --> 02:24:26.916]  We get silence.
[02:24:27.276 --> 02:24:34.119]  They place in power all these people that are just robots, because we have seen the left wing just acting as robots.
[02:24:34.939 --> 02:24:40.264]  And, of course, the demonic forces will prosper and take over the system if we don't stop them.
[02:24:40.825 --> 02:24:53.236]  So, I mean, we are at a crucial point in history, and you have said this over and over again on your show, and I also endorse your products because you're doing a great job in surviving with InfoWars.
[02:24:53.796 --> 02:24:59.962]  And we are trying to survive because this is still a voice of freedom, but we don't know for how long.
[02:25:00.242 --> 02:25:04.983]  Because this legion of demons is growing more and more powerful each day.
[02:25:05.404 --> 02:25:07.664]  And they control the artificial intelligence.
[02:25:08.084 --> 02:25:09.885]  They control Silicon Valley.
[02:25:10.405 --> 02:25:14.907]  So for how long are we going to be allowed to even talk on the World Wide Web?
[02:25:14.967 --> 02:25:16.327]  Is this a matter of time?
[02:25:16.347 --> 02:25:19.188]  So this is where we are going, Alex.
[02:25:20.538 --> 02:25:21.659]  That was my next question.
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:23.401]  They lied to Congress.
[02:25:23.441 --> 02:25:24.022]  They lied.
[02:25:24.683 --> 02:25:26.284]  Total censorship is taking place.
[02:25:26.785 --> 02:25:27.546]  Total attacks.
[02:25:27.566 --> 02:25:29.268]  They're openly trying to sexualize children.
[02:25:29.608 --> 02:25:31.050]  Pedophilia is being announced on the news.
[02:25:31.110 --> 02:25:31.690]  It's a good thing.
[02:25:32.251 --> 02:25:33.292]  There's a coming out.
[02:25:33.492 --> 02:25:34.774]  I see that as a sign of weakness.
[02:25:34.794 --> 02:25:37.457]  But as you said, the enemy does control the technocracy.
[02:25:39.310 --> 02:25:54.359]  Absolutely, because I have evidence in my new book, Volume 6.66, that John Podesta met with Piero Giorgio Bassi to discuss some very delicate matters that regard alien life
[02:25:54.699 --> 02:25:55.019]  I think?
[02:26:14.290 --> 02:26:21.092]  Let's stop right there.
[02:26:21.172 --> 02:26:23.372]  I got Stuart Rhodes coming up.
[02:26:23.412 --> 02:26:25.392]  I want to do five more minutes with you because here's the deal.
[02:26:25.993 --> 02:26:26.613]  I'm a Christian.
[02:26:26.653 --> 02:26:28.813]  I believe in God, but I've never seen a flying saucer.
[02:26:28.833 --> 02:26:36.075]  I don't get into Bigfoot, chupacabras, Easter bunnies, Keebler elves, Santa Claus or socialism working.
[02:26:36.195 --> 02:26:36.795]  I don't believe in it.
[02:26:37.535 --> 02:26:44.398]  But when you study San Francisco, and you study the CIA, they're taking drugs, they believe inter-dimensionally, to talk to aliens in another dimension.
[02:26:44.658 --> 02:26:45.318]  That's their cult.
[02:26:46.279 --> 02:26:53.062]  Then you look, exactly, but you're saying Moscow, and they believe they're in contact, well then why has the U.S.
[02:26:53.082 --> 02:26:54.422]  been given all the advanced technology?
[02:26:54.722 --> 02:27:03.086]  But when you talk to the average elitist, the average billionaire, I've talked to some of them, like Elon Musk has come out against all this, they believe they're in contact with off-world
[02:27:04.198 --> 02:27:05.381]  Or interdimensional entities.
[02:27:05.802 --> 02:27:08.829]  And so you're bringing up this bombshell information because that's what this all comes down to.
[02:27:10.783 --> 02:27:26.036]  There is a specific group that is called the Expert Management Unit of General Staff, and there is actually an academic, important academic in Russia called Natalia Beketereva, and then there is Lieutenant General Alexei Savin.
[02:27:26.316 --> 02:27:35.965]  These people with the Jesuits, they are doing and working for the real Russian collusion with these demonic forces, and I have the evidence for it now.
[02:27:36.425 --> 02:27:37.686]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:27:37.706 --> 02:27:40.308]  You've said so much has been true over the years about the Vatican, you've been a trailblazer.
[02:27:40.728 --> 02:27:41.829]  And I'm not even defending Russia.
[02:27:41.849 --> 02:27:43.230]  You said Russia was good with Berlusconi.
[02:27:43.810 --> 02:27:47.433]  What about San Francisco and how they think they're working with the off-world influence?
[02:27:47.653 --> 02:27:49.874]  They're already controlled, Alex.
[02:27:50.075 --> 02:27:52.456]  They are completely already, they have submitted.
[02:27:52.736 --> 02:27:58.180]  That's why, you know, John Podesta and all those people have already made a deal with Silicon Valley.
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:27:59.301]  Obama... So wait, wait, wait.
[02:27:59.321 --> 02:28:02.223]  You're saying the Russians are now making the deal with the off-world group?
[02:28:03.874 --> 02:28:05.015]  Yeah, of course.
[02:28:05.435 --> 02:28:07.596]  That's what they're doing, and we have the evidence here.
[02:28:07.617 --> 02:28:09.258]  I'm not talking about conspiracy theories.
[02:28:09.358 --> 02:28:20.985]  I have evidence that I'm showing in my new book, which is called Bonneville 6.66, and it's going to create a stir, because this evidence has accurate sources, very accurate, and I'm not just bragging.
[02:28:21.225 --> 02:28:23.187]  There is serious journalist... Well, let's be clear.
[02:28:24.189 --> 02:28:36.072]  We're on a planet in deep space, whether you believe in entities or the devil or God or not, the elites believe, from Skull and Bones to all these groups to Aleister Crowley, that they're getting divine influence from angels or entities.
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:37.801]  No, someone.
[02:29:07.228 --> 02:29:08.548]  Here's the thing, I'm not giving up.
[02:29:09.269 --> 02:29:13.890]  Because I know we've got truth and justice on our side, but it takes money to wage this war.
[02:29:14.290 --> 02:29:17.991]  You're spreading the word, you're praying for us, and you're financially supporting us.
[02:29:18.251 --> 02:29:21.332]  It's key, it's essential, it's absolute like oxygen.
[02:29:21.652 --> 02:29:24.453]  We have to have it, and we've got great products you already need.
[02:29:24.473 --> 02:29:25.593]  I mean, take fish oil.
[02:29:25.653 --> 02:29:27.674]  What it does for your heart, your brain, energy.
[02:29:27.694 --> 02:29:29.294]  I don't even usually take a nootropic.
[02:29:29.314 --> 02:29:35.156]  If I'm up at 10 o'clock at night, and I gotta work till 3am on Coast to Coast AM or some show, I pop five fish oils.
[02:29:35.456 --> 02:29:36.957]  Nobody calls fish oil nootropic.
[02:29:37.517 --> 02:29:38.678]  Your brain's electrochemical.
[02:29:38.818 --> 02:29:41.040]  It's basically made out of what fish oil is.
[02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:42.641]  Fish oil is what floats my boat.
[02:29:43.561 --> 02:29:44.862]  I mean, I take it every morning right now.
[02:29:45.082 --> 02:29:49.766]  First thing I get up at 6 a.m., with my coffee, I bang back three big ol' fat, juicy fish oils.
[02:29:50.066 --> 02:29:55.289]  And so, our Ultimate Krill Oil is even better than the fish oil, what it does for your brain, but there's no way to denature it.
[02:29:55.369 --> 02:29:58.431]  It gives you the burps, I'm not gonna lie to you, but if you can deal with it, it's it.
[02:29:58.451 --> 02:30:00.893]  The Ultimate Krill Oil is rocket fuel, baby.
[02:30:01.033 --> 02:30:02.234]  I mean, it's the next level.
[02:30:02.734 --> 02:30:05.155]  Fish oil, all crafted out of fjords, amazing.
[02:30:05.255 --> 02:30:07.515]  Doesn't give you the burpees, neither does Honor Roll.
[02:30:07.655 --> 02:30:10.336]  It's amazing for your kids, small capitalists, but I tend to like Honor Roll.
[02:30:10.456 --> 02:30:12.276]  Okay, I'm a fish oil addict, I'm not gonna lie.
[02:30:12.416 --> 02:30:13.216]  I gobble the stuff.
[02:30:13.497 --> 02:30:14.657]  Coffee's a thing of the past now.
[02:30:15.277 --> 02:30:16.517]  Brainforce is a thing of the past.
[02:30:16.657 --> 02:30:18.278]  And for different people, different things.
[02:30:19.138 --> 02:30:22.199]  I'm just telling you, fish oil is numero uno.

[02:31:36.644 --> 02:31:40.186]  Andy wants to talk about being involved in the fight for the 2nd A. Yeah, that's the big one.
[02:31:40.686 --> 02:31:41.847]  They're coming at it with guns.
[02:31:41.887 --> 02:31:44.308]  The Democrats say they have the votes in the House to ban semi-autos.
[02:31:44.328 --> 02:31:45.809]  They're going to try to pass it.
[02:31:46.189 --> 02:31:49.972]  Notice they've gone from denying they want to ban the 2nd Amendment to admitting it, Andy.
[02:31:50.232 --> 02:31:51.272]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[02:31:51.332 --> 02:31:53.053]  I've got to say, Alex, I'm a big fan of the show.
[02:31:53.073 --> 02:31:54.234]  I still have both of my daughters.
[02:31:54.594 --> 02:32:00.899]  I need to take some of that because I'm a little bit run down with allergies today and I'm always like, wait, my own products are great.
[02:32:00.959 --> 02:32:03.421]  I think I should take some Brain Force Plus and some Secret 12.
[02:32:03.461 --> 02:32:04.022]  Absolutely.
[02:32:15.811 --> 02:32:16.031]  Right.
[02:32:16.051 --> 02:32:16.571]  There you go.
[02:32:16.651 --> 02:32:23.234]  Well, hey, in my home state of Connecticut here, we're facing some very tough economic times, which is causing taxes to go up.
[02:32:23.274 --> 02:32:25.595]  There's businesses and people leaving the state in droves.
[02:32:25.675 --> 02:32:33.078]  One of the taxes they're introducing, or want to, hopefully this won't pass, is they want a 50% tax on your ammunition, no matter what it is.
[02:32:33.158 --> 02:32:35.459]  They also forced, I mean, they forced Remington out of business.
[02:32:35.479 --> 02:32:38.500]  The same law firm suing me sued Remington out of business.
[02:32:38.660 --> 02:32:43.243]  Yeah, another law they're trying to pass is to ban all semi-automatic weapons in my state.
[02:32:43.263 --> 02:32:45.765]  Which means anything, well you know what a semi-automatic is.
[02:32:45.805 --> 02:32:46.885]  Anything semi-automatic?
[02:32:47.106 --> 02:32:47.946]  Yeah, anything.
[02:32:48.346 --> 02:32:50.648]  Anything you pull the trigger it shoots a bullet.
[02:33:06.349 --> 02:33:23.803]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:23.923 --> 02:33:29.047]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.806 --> 02:33:36.628]  Strange days.
[02:33:37.550 --> 02:33:44.804]  Well, they've tracked us down.
[02:34:04.810 --> 02:34:11.778]  We're on a planet in deep space, on a tiny little galaxy out of trillions, two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm.
[02:34:12.759 --> 02:34:17.745]  Leo Zagani best-selling author and researcher in Rome is our guest finishing up with him.
[02:34:19.486 --> 02:34:25.914]  Just the fantastical nature of mainstream news admitting that the Vatican is a giant
[02:34:27.327 --> 02:34:45.110]  Homosexual orgy facility with a bunch of dead kids getting raped and every major diocese from Austin, Texas to Boston, Massachusetts to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is just a giant cult, an army that took over the church and now it's all coming out.
[02:34:45.330 --> 02:34:46.351]  What are they going to do?
[02:34:46.371 --> 02:34:50.591]  I think their answer is bring in a war, bring in tyranny, bring in suppression.
[02:34:50.972 --> 02:34:52.752]  I think we're seeing their answer and like you said,
[02:34:53.732 --> 02:34:55.194]  What is the secret society nature?
[02:34:55.754 --> 02:35:02.081]  If the devil's fallen, not of this world, but now the God of this world, what does the God of this world want?
[02:35:02.101 --> 02:35:02.721]  What's the endgame?
[02:35:04.283 --> 02:35:06.686]  They wanted the birth of the Antichrist.
[02:35:06.726 --> 02:35:08.567]  The year Satan won was 1966.
[02:35:08.848 --> 02:35:13.633]  They well overdue the arrival of the Antichrist.
[02:35:14.324 --> 02:35:15.386]  This is not a joke.
[02:35:31.667 --> 02:35:37.489]  Catholic liturgy to facilitate this demonic possession of our society.
[02:35:37.549 --> 02:35:44.831]  Because the right of exorcism is the only right that can stop these creatures, these demons that talk with Russia, facilitate Russia.
[02:35:45.011 --> 02:35:48.012]  But Russia then plays both sides of the game.
[02:35:48.413 --> 02:35:51.173]  And of course, then you are tricked in it.
[02:35:51.253 --> 02:35:58.856]  Because behind there is this demonic forces and they are with the Vatican totally in league together.
[02:35:59.176 --> 02:36:07.039]  So they have transformed the Vatican in this gay pedophile sect, so then they can welcome the Antichrist.
[02:36:07.119 --> 02:36:10.120]  And they have done it already, Alex, in 1963.
[02:36:10.541 --> 02:36:14.342]  And Father Malachi Martin was a victim of these demons.
[02:36:14.622 --> 02:36:21.105]  We are fighting a war here with entities that are not of this world, that possess our politicians, our religious leaders.
[02:36:21.815 --> 02:36:24.856]  This has to be taken very seriously before it gets out of control.
[02:36:25.176 --> 02:36:33.119]  Because the moment the Artificial Intelligence plan gets everything, then Cyber-Satan will simply enslave this race.
[02:36:33.859 --> 02:36:35.720]  So we need to understand this.
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:45.804]  You'll have an omnipresent system, temporarily, interfaced with a spiritual system, finally giving the demonic projection real-world eyes and ears.
[02:36:47.714 --> 02:36:47.994]  Yes.
[02:36:48.634 --> 02:36:51.856]  For them, God is dead, Satan lives.
[02:36:52.316 --> 02:36:54.197]  These are full-on Satanists.
[02:36:54.657 --> 02:36:58.499]  Pope Francis is a perfectly possessed person.
[02:36:58.859 --> 02:37:11.745]  He is basically controlled by a demon, and every time the camera goes slightly offset, and you basically catch him off guard, maybe doing a photo, you can see the demon in his eyes.
[02:37:12.574 --> 02:37:14.276]  Pope Francis is possessed.
[02:37:14.537 --> 02:37:19.824]  This means that the Catholic Church is literally the biggest church of Satan.
[02:37:20.265 --> 02:37:23.910]  You're saying the Catholic Church has become the seat of Satan?
[02:37:25.290 --> 02:37:29.291]  Yes, and then of course they endorse the Satanic Temple in the U.S.
[02:37:29.311 --> 02:37:30.731]  that can be pro-abortion.
[02:37:31.011 --> 02:37:39.614]  Abortions, and of course they need... And by the way, Leo, as you said, make no mistake, you have Governor of Virginia saying we kill babies after they're born.
[02:37:39.974 --> 02:37:43.375]  You have New York celebrating it and cackling like witches.
[02:37:43.715 --> 02:37:48.676]  This is all lesser magic, as they call it, in our face celebrating the killing.
[02:37:49.904 --> 02:37:51.825]  It's Molo all over again.
[02:37:52.106 --> 02:37:54.407]  They need the soul of these infants.
[02:37:54.707 --> 02:37:56.609]  They can do it with abortion.
[02:37:56.629 --> 02:37:58.330]  They can do it with rituals.
[02:37:58.510 --> 02:37:58.910]  Exactly.
[02:37:58.950 --> 02:38:02.433]  So what does the souls, what does oppressing children give them?
[02:38:02.773 --> 02:38:04.234]  Why are they so oppressed with the innocent?
[02:38:06.081 --> 02:38:11.084]  Because they are offering them to the gods, so the gods then, in turn, give them power.
[02:38:11.244 --> 02:38:18.789]  So they are enslaved by these demons, by these alien demons, because they have to sacrifice and sacrifice and sacrifice if they want to maintain this power.
[02:38:19.170 --> 02:38:28.436]  We have to stop... Just like the Babylonians, just like the Aztecs, just like the Druids, why do groups get in control that just demand more dead children?
[02:38:28.496 --> 02:38:30.937]  It's just, something gets control and demands dead kids.
[02:38:31.198 --> 02:38:32.759]  Why would humans want to kill their own children?
[02:38:32.779 --> 02:38:33.159]  We wouldn't.
[02:38:34.475 --> 02:38:36.236]  Alex, they do it for power.
[02:38:36.556 --> 02:38:39.938]  These are not, you know, these are people who stop in front of nothing.
[02:38:39.958 --> 02:38:53.624]  500 years ago, Caterina de' Medici sacrificed a child celebrating the first Black Mass in Paris that became the worldwide capital of Satanism because her own son was sick and then she had other problems.
[02:38:53.825 --> 02:38:56.626]  So, OK, she celebrated with a Catholic priest because
[02:38:57.366 --> 02:39:01.549]  The real Black Mass can only be celebrated by a Catholic priest.
[02:39:01.869 --> 02:39:03.210]  People don't understand this.
[02:39:03.250 --> 02:39:04.931]  But even Alistair Crowley said it.
[02:39:04.951 --> 02:39:06.112]  Even Anthony LeMay.
[02:39:06.572 --> 02:39:11.615]  If you want the argument... Because they have to have the blasphemy of it done in the church by a priest.
[02:39:11.815 --> 02:39:13.116]  That is the perfect inversion.
[02:39:14.946 --> 02:39:21.930]  Of course, because if you are not a holy person, if you have not been blessed with the lineage of St.
[02:39:21.970 --> 02:39:26.452]  Peter and of Jesus, then you're just a normal person, you're a normal folk, no?
[02:39:26.713 --> 02:39:35.157]  That's why today is very important for them to save McCarrick from being completely defrocked, because he celebrates satanic masses.
[02:39:35.377 --> 02:39:39.319]  The moment they defrock him, McCarrick can't celebrate them anymore.
[02:39:39.559 --> 02:39:40.460]  So dear McCarrick,
[02:39:41.368 --> 02:39:44.792]  Maybe your career as a Satanist is finished altogether.
[02:39:45.252 --> 02:39:45.813]  Who knows?
[02:39:46.394 --> 02:39:47.675]  This is what is happening right now.
[02:39:47.695 --> 02:39:49.137]  We're going to have you back up soon.
[02:39:49.157 --> 02:39:51.579]  Stuart Rosenblum has got huge news coming up next segment.
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:53.702]  Then we've got other big guests today.
[02:39:56.385 --> 02:39:58.047]  I see the Satanists are on the offense.
[02:39:58.067 --> 02:40:00.069]  They also seem very scared right now.
[02:40:00.690 --> 02:40:01.811]  Do you agree with that A and B?
[02:40:01.871 --> 02:40:02.652]  Why are they so scared?
[02:40:04.110 --> 02:40:12.098]  They're scared because of course we are finally seeing them clearly, clearly and more clearly because they can't help themselves.
[02:40:12.118 --> 02:40:15.241]  In Italy there was a festival called Sanremo Festival.
[02:40:15.502 --> 02:40:26.313]  They even had the courage of saying five times Satan in a kind of, it was supposed to be a comedy sketch, and instead at one point they said, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan.
[02:40:26.813 --> 02:40:28.315]  And it's now all over the news.
[02:40:28.535 --> 02:40:33.820]  Even the Vatican had to criticize this festival of Sanremo for invoking Satan.
[02:40:34.141 --> 02:40:37.304]  I mean, in Italy, we're invoking Satan on public TV.
[02:40:37.384 --> 02:40:38.485]  This is crazy!
[02:40:38.505 --> 02:40:41.188]  This is insane, Alex.
[02:40:41.649 --> 02:40:44.331]  Well, we had the head of the EU say, Satan rejects you.
[02:40:45.229 --> 02:40:46.170]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:40:46.250 --> 02:40:46.631]  All the best.
[02:40:46.671 --> 02:40:47.131]  God bless America.
[02:41:05.029 --> 02:41:05.629]  We're going to go to break.
[02:41:05.649 --> 02:41:06.930]  We're going to come back with Stuart Rhodes.
[02:41:07.090 --> 02:41:13.213]  I just want to remind listeners, ladies and gentlemen, that, hey, I don't complain about it, but this is a real war.
[02:41:13.273 --> 02:41:17.414]  This isn't like your average show, like, oh, we're the cutting edge, oh, the tip of the spear, oh, support us.
[02:41:18.175 --> 02:41:22.997]  We are in absolute contention, in war with the globalists.
[02:41:24.037 --> 02:41:26.959]  We are taking them on at point-blank range.
[02:41:29.687 --> 02:41:33.489]  If you go to the establishment hotels or go to establishment grocery stores, I don't judge you.
[02:41:33.529 --> 02:41:34.070]  We all do it.
[02:41:34.450 --> 02:41:35.390]  That's all you can buy from.
[02:41:35.430 --> 02:41:44.816]  But if you just get your coffee, organic, high quality, M4store.com, five stars, third party review sites, Wake of America Coffee.
[02:41:44.876 --> 02:41:49.839]  If you just get your high quality, fluoride free, coital silver, iodine fortified, super blue toothpaste.
[02:41:50.659 --> 02:41:51.640]  If you just get
[02:41:52.913 --> 02:41:55.174]  We've got them in two different flavors.
[02:41:55.194 --> 02:42:00.636]  We've got them in vanilla coconut, and we've got them in, of course, the other flavor, peanut butter and chocolate.
[02:42:00.716 --> 02:42:01.476]  It's the highest end.
[02:42:01.576 --> 02:42:02.316]  It's at a lower price.
[02:42:02.677 --> 02:42:03.077]  No reviews yet.
[02:42:03.097 --> 02:42:03.997]  We just went on sale today.
[02:42:21.027 --> 02:42:22.188]  How will the media demonize that?
[02:42:22.208 --> 02:42:24.069]  Oh, he sells protein bars now.
[02:42:24.149 --> 02:42:26.752]  That's not allowed.
[02:42:26.772 --> 02:42:29.394]  12 bars, $36 instead of $48.
[02:42:29.454 --> 02:42:31.695]  It's a huge savings.
[02:42:31.815 --> 02:42:32.996]  It funds our whole operation.
[02:42:33.517 --> 02:42:36.759]  Please take action at ForrestLife.com and ForrestWare.com.
[02:42:36.859 --> 02:42:40.222]  And there's a big sale ending, by the way, this weekend as well.
[02:42:40.242 --> 02:42:45.986]  50% off on BrainForce Plus, our great nootropic, and, of course, the combo pack.
[02:42:46.767 --> 02:42:50.573]  Turbo Force, but whatever you do, fund us, because without you, we're going nowhere.
[02:42:50.614 --> 02:42:59.869]  But listen, get your coffee, get your toothpaste, get your protein bar, sign up for AutoShip, an additional 10% off, and don't worry about it, know you're funding the M4.
[02:42:59.949 --> 02:43:00.930]  A total win-win!
[02:43:09.105 --> 02:43:10.567]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jessica.
[02:43:10.587 --> 02:43:12.009]  She wants to talk about the Virginia governor.
[02:43:12.489 --> 02:43:13.390]  Jessica, you're on the air.
[02:43:13.410 --> 02:43:15.212]  Looks like he'll be resigning soon.
[02:43:15.232 --> 02:43:15.653]  What do you think?
[02:43:16.253 --> 02:43:17.094]  I hope so.
[02:43:17.875 --> 02:43:19.537]  I never liked him from the beginning.
[02:43:19.758 --> 02:43:27.767]  I remember that President Obama endorsed him, and that was a big... I thought that would be a big wake-up call to people, but apparently it wasn't.
[02:43:28.067 --> 02:43:30.228]  But we keep the babies comfortable.
[02:43:30.248 --> 02:43:33.709]  I can't really do his fake Southern accent, but it's just, I love Southerners.
[02:43:33.769 --> 02:43:35.170]  I'm from Texas, kind of Southern.
[02:43:35.270 --> 02:43:42.653]  But it's like the fakeness of that sicky sweet, let's stay out of the ladies area, kill that baby.
[02:43:42.833 --> 02:43:48.635]  I think because he's a pediatrician, he's used to people, you know, kind of responding to that voice he does.
[02:43:48.695 --> 02:43:53.437]  But it sickens me that he's a pediatrician and he's pushing what he's pushing.
[02:43:53.497 --> 02:43:55.938]  But we're going to make the baby comfortable.
[02:43:56.638 --> 02:43:58.220]  Oh my gosh, it's so sickening.
[02:43:58.300 --> 02:44:00.922]  Well, we know in the end times, this is the stuff that happens.
[02:44:00.962 --> 02:44:06.005]  That's why I'm so proud of you and the InfoWars team for all that you do.
[02:44:06.186 --> 02:44:08.527]  And I love, I wanted to say I love your product.
[02:44:08.768 --> 02:44:11.910]  I have X2 and the Selenium for my thyroid.
[02:44:12.090 --> 02:44:13.972]  I have to say that it's worked wonders.
[02:44:14.052 --> 02:44:16.395]  The Brain Force Plus is amazing.
[02:44:16.736 --> 02:44:30.913]  Me and my family take it every day and I mean you really can feel what it does and usually I get a lot of brain fog from the thyroid issue and that helps tremendously and the knockout helps me sleep at night especially when I have something important I have to get up and do it.
[02:44:30.913 --> 02:44:31.793]  Well, Jessie, I appreciate that.
[02:44:54.002 --> 02:45:01.025]  I really am glad that I'm able to help the fight for truth and freedom and liberty and I don't know where I would be and what I would think if I didn't have people like you on air who have just stayed
[02:45:18.294 --> 02:45:18.814]  I don't know.
[02:45:48.855 --> 02:45:50.857]  No, no, I totally agree.
[02:45:51.518 --> 02:45:55.664]  We put out the one gold foil female shirt that was a big hit, and we're just brain dead.
[02:45:55.684 --> 02:45:58.167]  But I promise, that's our number one complaint, is from women.
[02:45:58.187 --> 02:46:00.109]  We've only got a couple shirts that are cut for females.
[02:46:00.149 --> 02:46:01.131]  We will get it done for you.
[02:46:01.151 --> 02:46:06.438]  But Jessica, you give me strength to go on, and your husband and your family, because just hearing what's in your voice, the
[02:46:06.718 --> 02:46:13.799]  The powerful feminine energy and then the male energy together, all of us focused together against the globalists, is unstoppable.
[02:46:14.179 --> 02:46:18.720]  And that's why they're attacking a sacred system of the family, of all of us together.
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:19.920]  We are humanity.
[02:46:20.221 --> 02:46:21.181]  We are the experience.
[02:46:21.221 --> 02:46:21.981]  We are everything.
[02:46:22.401 --> 02:46:24.201]  And so you've just got my commitment to fight on.
[02:46:24.221 --> 02:46:26.482]  But let me tell you, I'm obnoxious most of the time.
[02:46:26.542 --> 02:46:27.062]  I'm burnout.
[02:46:27.442 --> 02:46:29.382]  Hearing you, I don't want to just say this.
[02:46:29.522 --> 02:46:30.222]  I'm not just telling you this.
[02:46:30.742 --> 02:46:31.823]  You are the info war.
[02:46:31.943 --> 02:46:33.223]  You're the power of the whole thing.
[02:46:33.783 --> 02:46:38.084]  And that's why I get so freaked out about begging the audience for help, because it's the truth!
[02:46:38.184 --> 02:46:39.285]  I mean, I'm not just saying it.
[02:46:39.385 --> 02:46:42.986]  If you weren't here, standing in the way, they would have already destroyed me.
[02:46:43.126 --> 02:46:44.326]  But we're in this together.
[02:46:44.486 --> 02:46:46.107]  So God bless you, Jessica from Virginia.
[02:46:46.127 --> 02:46:49.548]  And yeah, look at that little pathetic gremlin governor.
[02:46:49.728 --> 02:46:51.108]  Of course he's KKK.
[02:46:51.248 --> 02:46:53.389]  Who the hell wants to harvest babies' organs?
[02:46:53.429 --> 02:46:54.830]  That's what that's all really about.
[02:46:55.290 --> 02:46:56.490]  These are demons.
[02:46:57.010 --> 02:46:58.511]  But thanks to you and others, we're gonna win.
[02:46:58.571 --> 02:46:59.231]  Thank you so much.
[02:47:05.738 --> 02:47:11.860]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:24.945 --> 02:47:31.207]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:33.615 --> 02:47:40.197]  You know, Michael Moore looks like a big, fat, degenerate, beyond a pedophile.
[02:47:40.217 --> 02:47:42.578]  He looks like Hansel and Gretel, which would eat kids.
[02:47:42.598 --> 02:47:43.358]  I'm not saying he does.
[02:47:44.779 --> 02:47:49.481]  Um, people like, uh, some of those other hosts.
[02:47:50.701 --> 02:47:51.381]  Brian Stelter.
[02:47:51.401 --> 02:47:55.743]  I mean, they just look like a creepy, dishonorable son of a bitch, and their actions prove that.
[02:47:55.763 --> 02:47:56.523]  But look at this photo.
[02:47:56.583 --> 02:47:58.904]  If you're a TV, if you're a radio listener, I'll describe it.
[02:48:01.161 --> 02:48:23.690]  Cortez living in luxury Navy Yard apartment building and every photo every video every frame She's like this crazed mindless 60 IQ vessel So when Trump says we're gonna stop child kidnapping and free 3,000 women from sex slavery she shakes her head so did Kamala Harris and You think well, that's an idiot.
[02:48:23.710 --> 02:48:24.470]  Don't want to follow that.
[02:48:24.530 --> 02:48:27.431]  No, she's triggering the losers
[02:48:28.939 --> 02:48:34.411]  And you look at that, there's nothing but a crazed meth head, molly head lust for power.
[02:48:37.392 --> 02:48:41.436]  Stuart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers, was down in South Texas.
[02:48:41.516 --> 02:48:42.637]  Our crew was there as well.
[02:48:42.697 --> 02:48:54.988]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center, with billions, not just a half billion, reportedly it's billions, offshore of this big foreign intelligence group, they said, you're racist as a veterans group because you own guns.
[02:48:55.048 --> 02:48:55.849]  You can't have guns.
[02:48:55.869 --> 02:48:56.629]  You're a good slave.
[02:48:57.070 --> 02:49:01.333]  The founder of extremist armed militia had a front row seat at Trump's rally.
[02:49:02.054 --> 02:49:07.696]  Stuart Rhodes is loaded up, wherever you're at, tell us where you're at, I see you in a car, about this latest demonization.
[02:49:07.976 --> 02:49:16.959]  You know, Cortez could have armed guards, Beto, Pato, I'm sorry, Beto, or Rourke, he can have them, but if you're armed yourself, well, you're a bad person.
[02:49:18.559 --> 02:49:31.543]  Well, it was actually Media Matters, and pretty clearly, their whole point is to attack us, and they falsely claim that we are promoting white supremacist theories.
[02:49:32.356 --> 02:49:34.477]  And talking points.
[02:49:35.137 --> 02:49:41.540]  And really what they want to do is target us and paint us as white nationalists or white supremacists, which we are not.
[02:49:42.020 --> 02:49:46.842]  And then through that attack... Just so you know, Southern Poverty Law Center said stuff too, but you're right on that front.
[02:49:46.882 --> 02:49:49.903]  But at a certain point, who cares what these criminals say?
[02:49:49.963 --> 02:49:54.865]  Well, we better care, because if they say you're bad, you lose your bank account, you lose your website.
[02:49:55.165 --> 02:49:57.146]  I mean, you talk about Nazis, these people are criminal.
[02:49:58.376 --> 02:50:00.317]  Well, that and also they're defaming us.
[02:50:00.357 --> 02:50:02.398]  I mean, personally, I'm very insulted by this.
[02:50:02.899 --> 02:50:10.263]  My family on my mother's side, I'm a quarter Mexican, and my family on her side, you know, pick grapes and asparagus.
[02:50:10.283 --> 02:50:12.104]  They're migrant farm workers in California.
[02:50:12.465 --> 02:50:15.286]  I'm the furthest thing from a white nationalist or white supremacist.
[02:50:15.726 --> 02:50:17.327]  And so they have them smearing like this.
[02:50:17.427 --> 02:50:18.208]  It's defamation.
[02:50:20.319 --> 02:50:21.019]  Well, you're right, Stuart.
[02:50:21.079 --> 02:50:22.900]  I'm interrupting as your Skype's been breaking up.
[02:50:22.920 --> 02:50:24.701]  When it comes back, we'll go back to you.
[02:50:24.741 --> 02:50:32.343]  So, what do you make of this, where this lordly group, with all this money offshore, says you're a bad person, and then you're un-person?
[02:50:32.683 --> 02:50:34.604]  What do we do to this group, legally or lawfully?
[02:50:35.004 --> 02:50:36.124]  I think Trump should take action.
[02:50:36.144 --> 02:50:36.665]  This is clear.
[02:50:36.945 --> 02:50:38.065]  You're a constitutional lawyer.
[02:50:38.125 --> 02:50:40.926]  You're a Yale-graduated guy.
[02:50:41.406 --> 02:50:43.607]  As a lawyer, this is cut and dry, I think.
[02:50:46.348 --> 02:50:48.749]  Well, we need to sue them, and this is what we should be doing.
[02:50:49.813 --> 02:50:55.255]  The Covington Catholic kids do, and the same thing that was done by the moderate Muslim activists.
[02:50:58.396 --> 02:51:01.777]  And again, the beauties of Skype are amazing.
[02:51:01.937 --> 02:51:04.198]  If you're a radio listener, you're like, why does Jones keep interrupting?
[02:51:04.238 --> 02:51:05.638]  Stewart, go to camera.
[02:51:06.058 --> 02:51:06.778]  Side camera, please.
[02:51:07.279 --> 02:51:09.019]  Stewart, Skype is locking up.
[02:51:09.059 --> 02:51:12.040]  So every time Skype locks up, I pop back in.
[02:51:12.420 --> 02:51:14.141]  You were saying, same with the Covington kids.
[02:51:14.181 --> 02:51:14.481]  Go ahead.
[02:51:17.526 --> 02:51:19.208]  Yes, I mean, the answer is to sue them.
[02:51:19.408 --> 02:51:22.471]  That's what we need to start doing, all of us that are on the political right.
[02:51:22.752 --> 02:51:35.145]  The only attack the left has against us is a false accusation that if you're a patriot, if you advocate for enforcing our laws and securing our borders, that you are a racist or must be a racist.
[02:51:35.165 --> 02:51:37.627]  You know, that stadium was filled.
[02:51:37.647 --> 02:51:40.230]  At least about a quarter of the people there were brown.
[02:51:43.209 --> 02:51:46.331]  The sky breaks out and that's what panics the left.
[02:51:47.252 --> 02:51:55.917]  The biggest victory was saying Tea Party's all racist, but now as minorities come to these events, Stuart, it's really freaking them out that like, oh my god, everybody loves each other here.
[02:51:55.957 --> 02:51:56.818]  We just love America.
[02:52:00.460 --> 02:52:00.840]  Exactly.
[02:52:00.880 --> 02:52:02.501]  We all are in complete solidarity.
[02:52:02.521 --> 02:52:06.023]  Ironically, unlike the left, you know, we don't care about skin color.
[02:52:06.344 --> 02:52:08.245]  Yesterday I was down in Eagle Pass.
[02:52:08.305 --> 02:52:09.986]  I was given a tour by a local who was
[02:52:12.213 --> 02:52:14.954]  What are they going to do with even the skewed polls?
[02:52:15.214 --> 02:52:16.714]  Trump rises to 55, 56, 57 percent.
[02:52:16.754 --> 02:52:18.275]  With all their attacks, it's not working.
[02:52:41.121 --> 02:52:44.102]  Him letting blacks out of prison for longer sentences.
[02:52:45.103 --> 02:52:48.624]  Trump cutting taxes on poor people, raising them on actually middle class and rich.
[02:52:48.944 --> 02:52:51.005]  That's pretty damn classical liberal, actually.
[02:52:51.505 --> 02:52:52.265]  It's kind of JFK.
[02:52:52.285 --> 02:52:53.846]  It's like JFK's president, part two.
[02:52:54.466 --> 02:52:59.808]  And you know, as Trump tries to end these wars, how are they going to deal with the fact the public sees through it?
[02:53:04.630 --> 02:53:09.652]  They're going to have a hard time because he is actually carrying out real social justice.
[02:53:10.862 --> 02:53:12.823]  They always like to talk about being social justice warriors.
[02:53:13.123 --> 02:53:15.684]  Well, like you said, he's bringing jobs back.
[02:53:15.704 --> 02:53:16.624]  He's employing people.
[02:53:16.944 --> 02:53:22.106]  He's letting all kinds of people out of prison, but predominantly blacks and minorities who get slammed through the legal system.
[02:53:22.166 --> 02:53:24.687]  And that is a travesty, but he's the one who's freeing them.
[02:53:24.987 --> 02:53:37.571]  And I think you should go one step further and you should advocate for legalization of marijuana and let all of the non-violent drug offenders keep winning.
[02:53:38.837 --> 02:53:39.197]  That's right.
[02:53:39.217 --> 02:53:42.060]  Well, Stewart, I'm told you're going to be in Austin the next few days.
[02:53:42.581 --> 02:53:45.083]  It's Wednesday now, but Thursday, Friday, you're welcome in studio.
[02:53:45.463 --> 02:53:46.945]  So we're not doing this over the Skype, okay?
[02:53:52.662 --> 02:53:55.003]  I'll take that as a 10-4.
[02:53:55.563 --> 02:53:56.704]  Thank you, Stewart.
[02:53:57.304 --> 02:54:00.386]  So many times when Skype's screwing up, listeners are like, stop interrupting.
[02:54:00.886 --> 02:54:03.787]  And when it freezes and they don't talk for two seconds, I take over.
[02:54:03.827 --> 02:54:07.449]  And then it's backed up and they hear me five seconds later and they're talking over me.
[02:54:07.969 --> 02:54:08.589]  And I'm not bitching.
[02:54:08.649 --> 02:54:09.310]  It's technology.
[02:54:09.530 --> 02:54:10.050]  It's technology.
[02:54:11.849 --> 02:54:13.630]  And as compression gets better, it'll get better.
[02:54:13.790 --> 02:54:15.170]  But, it's like on a walkie-talkie.
[02:54:15.190 --> 02:54:16.471]  Walkie-talkie's like almost lifetime.
[02:54:16.491 --> 02:54:20.372]  Like, record one now, and I'm driving now, and suddenly I just got a smokey on somebody's tail.
[02:54:20.952 --> 02:54:21.793]  This is not like that.
[02:54:21.833 --> 02:54:28.015]  It's like, it gets compressed so somebody could be 10 seconds behind, and I'm just trying to talk to them, but my listeners are like, why are you interrupting him?
[02:54:28.575 --> 02:54:30.456]  Because they're video freezes.
[02:54:31.376 --> 02:54:32.897]  And I can't put out dead air.
[02:54:35.598 --> 02:54:38.939]  I've gotten better about not erupting on Skype.
[02:54:40.256 --> 02:54:41.057]  I've tried my best.
[02:54:42.138 --> 02:54:44.340]  But yeah, it's media matters.
[02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:45.181]  That's George Soros.
[02:54:47.163 --> 02:54:48.765]  Southern Poverty Law Center is poking out too.
[02:54:52.108 --> 02:55:02.258]  The founder of this extremist armed militia had a front row seat at the Trump rally.
[02:55:05.285 --> 02:55:14.910]  Meanwhile, Stuart Rhodes is an army veteran, combat veteran, worked for Ron Paul, is a constitutional lawyer, top of his class at Yale, won big awards at Yale, has no criminal record.
[02:55:15.630 --> 02:55:21.953]  But see, they don't tell you, like, top of his class Yale graduate army veteran is a militia person.
[02:55:21.993 --> 02:55:29.097]  No, it's like, oh my God, there were these crazy white supremacists running around with forked tails foaming at their mouths.
[02:55:29.117 --> 02:55:32.859]  And they don't tell you Stuart Rhodes' mama is a Mexican.
[02:55:33.846 --> 02:55:39.688]  It's all crap, and the globalists are trying to collapse the country right now.
[02:55:40.769 --> 02:55:42.570]  And it really just comes down to something that simple.
[02:55:44.350 --> 02:55:57.636]  You know, I can sit here and talk about this all day, and I can sit here and try to market things better, and I can sit here and try to, you know, be even more compelling and whatever, but there are a bunch of cold-blooded rich people that think you're stupid.
[02:55:59.386 --> 02:56:10.790]  And they think, just join with the establishment, train everybody to be slaves, consolidate power, build a world government, take the advanced technology for ourselves, because everybody can't get life extension, and then kill everybody.
[02:56:11.790 --> 02:56:15.151]  Well, that sounds like some recipe for doom to me.
[02:56:16.471 --> 02:56:18.492]  It doesn't sound like some recipe for victory.
[02:56:22.773 --> 02:56:24.074]  It doesn't sound like freedom to me.
[02:56:24.094 --> 02:56:28.215]  I mean, mainstream news admits
[02:56:29.744 --> 02:56:32.186]  Four out of five Vatican priests are gay.
[02:56:38.069 --> 02:56:42.432]  So the once Christian church is now a bathhouse.
[02:56:43.493 --> 02:56:44.413]  It's now a gay bar.
[02:56:45.274 --> 02:56:47.115]  And listen, I'm not attacking gay bars.
[02:56:48.536 --> 02:56:55.881]  I'm just saying, wow, what group like has this desire to run every facet of our lives?
[02:56:58.883 --> 02:57:14.054]  Because I don't care if you're heterosexual or homosexual, when you start trying to get kids' pants down around their ankles, that's when I start to go into Hulk mode or King Kong mode.
[02:57:15.071 --> 02:57:27.198]  And so, we've all, in the West, given the Left so much acquiescence, so much line, like a fish on a line, that we just let them run out, and run out, and run out.
[02:57:27.338 --> 02:57:37.684]  And there's weird palaces in Rome, with a bunch of pedophiles, screwing kids, and we're supposed to just, well, let them do that, or they'll come after you.
[02:57:39.666 --> 02:57:43.148]  There is a God in Heaven, but this planet is infested by evil.
[02:57:44.164 --> 02:57:47.808]  And it's time that the whole planet has a big giant exorcism.
[02:57:48.408 --> 02:57:50.050]  We'll be right back with hour number four.
[02:57:50.070 --> 02:57:50.551]  Stay with us.
[02:58:03.305 --> 02:58:10.131]  We are offering our best-selling product, BrainForce+, the amazing nootropic for focus, energy, intelligence, you name it.
[02:58:10.151 --> 02:58:11.372]  It's just amazing.
[02:58:11.612 --> 02:58:12.413]  It's 50% off.
[02:58:12.453 --> 02:58:13.754]  That is a massive discount.
[02:58:13.774 --> 02:58:18.638]  But I've got to stop this sale, even though it's been very successful, because we're running low on BrainForce+.
[02:58:18.678 --> 02:58:19.579]  Now, it's 50% off.
[02:58:20.259 --> 02:58:23.342]  Coupled in a combo with TurboForce at 33% off.
[02:58:23.522 --> 02:58:25.765]  So the two together are a massive savings.
[02:58:25.905 --> 02:58:28.267]  Now BrainForce is a nootropic for the brain.
[02:58:28.508 --> 02:58:32.672]  And leading competitors are 2-3 times more with similar ingredients.
[02:58:32.712 --> 02:58:35.955]  This is the best ingredients out there at the lowest price.
[02:58:36.736 --> 02:58:38.518]  You couple it with TurboForce.
[02:58:38.778 --> 02:58:39.879]  I don't even know what to call it.
[02:58:39.939 --> 02:58:40.860]  Is it a pre-workout?
[02:58:40.960 --> 02:58:42.081]  Is it long-lasting energy?
[02:58:42.101 --> 02:58:43.242]  Is it next-level energy drink?
[02:58:43.302 --> 02:58:43.983]  That's what it all is.
[02:58:44.143 --> 02:58:52.451]  It's healthy, long-lasting energy, clean-burning with all the different types of naturally occurring energy, with the amino acids, with the vitamins, the minerals, and so much more.
[02:58:52.511 --> 02:58:54.092]  It's TurboForce, comes in packets.
[02:58:54.332 --> 02:58:58.436]  I suggest you only take half a packet the first time you take it, and if you take it
[02:58:58.476 --> 02:58:59.857]  With Brain Force, they go together great.
[02:58:59.897 --> 02:59:02.418]  Just be careful because it's really, really strong.
[02:59:02.498 --> 02:59:05.980]  The great part about it is most people take energy drinks, last 2-3 hours, you crash from it.
[02:59:06.221 --> 02:59:09.783]  Most folks respond to this saying 10 hours of energy with no crash.
[02:59:09.983 --> 02:59:12.844]  Everybody's metabolic system is different, so experience it for yourself.
[02:59:12.904 --> 02:59:13.545]  Here's the bottom line.
[02:59:13.765 --> 02:59:14.946]  These products together
[02:59:15.746 --> 02:59:17.187]  Are at the lowest price ever.

[02:59:20.870 --> 02:59:22.491]  33% off with a BrainForce.
[02:59:22.611 --> 02:59:24.413]  BrainForce is 50% off when you combo it.
[02:59:24.453 --> 02:59:25.754]  That is an amazing deal.

[02:59:56.363 --> 03:00:00.307]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:00:19.702 --> 03:00:25.948]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:54.366 --> 03:00:57.528]  Mike Adams is about to take over for this in our nationalnews.com.
[03:00:58.448 --> 03:01:14.777]  I tried to cover this yesterday when Gavin McGuinness was in, and we cursefully went over it, but this isn't the main focus of what Mike's about to cover, but imagine Apple, now that they banned us for having the number one app in news, that's our punishment for being number one, their curation.
[03:01:16.538 --> 03:01:17.698]  What's popular is banned.
[03:01:18.378 --> 03:01:19.479]  What the people want is banned.
[03:01:19.899 --> 03:01:20.680]  Freedom is banned.
[03:01:21.601 --> 03:01:27.464]  To say you can't talk about devil worship, a bunch of things that Mike's going to list coming up.
[03:01:32.247 --> 03:01:33.887]  It shows how weak they are, actually.
[03:01:34.608 --> 03:01:35.588]  But maybe we're weak.
[03:01:35.648 --> 03:01:38.690]  Maybe we've put up with so much, we'll put up with anything.
[03:01:38.730 --> 03:01:41.031]  Here's another article at NaturalNews.com.
[03:01:41.551 --> 03:01:43.713]  We're going to post InfoWorks.com, you better believe it.
[03:01:44.313 --> 03:01:44.853]  Analysis.
[03:01:46.869 --> 03:01:57.435]  Alexandria Cortez's Green New Deal would unleash a catastrophic food collapse and Venezuela-style mass starvation across America.
[03:01:57.936 --> 03:01:58.916]  That's not alarmist.
[03:01:59.516 --> 03:02:00.557]  It's worse than that.
[03:02:02.938 --> 03:02:08.602]  But then when you look at socialists and globalists and the weird crazed thing they're involved in,
[03:02:09.909 --> 03:02:16.314]  You go, oh my God, this is a program literally to destroy the planet.
[03:02:16.334 --> 03:02:19.397]  I mean, when you look at that, I don't say this as an elitist.
[03:02:20.378 --> 03:02:31.707]  When you look at that low IQ or Eham Omar, when you look at these people, you think, oh, you know, no, no, these people are mindless morons.
[03:02:32.367 --> 03:02:33.829]  But then that enters the equation
[03:02:35.123 --> 03:02:38.485]  Why then aren't intelligent people in charge helping everyone?
[03:02:38.525 --> 03:02:41.187]  Because we're giving them complex arguments.
[03:02:42.408 --> 03:02:44.649]  And I'm not being elitist, it's just true.
[03:02:45.030 --> 03:02:47.291]  We're dialed into stuff that's not on their plane.
[03:02:49.613 --> 03:02:51.854]  But in Somalia, they don't let a woman even leave the house.
[03:02:51.894 --> 03:02:53.215]  They sell the woman to sex slaves.
[03:02:53.916 --> 03:02:58.359]  Cortez, I mean, she's... These people are monsters.
[03:03:00.020 --> 03:03:04.643]  And Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com, they use our open, free society against us
[03:03:06.846 --> 03:03:09.187]  What do we do when faced with a cancer like this?
[03:03:10.927 --> 03:03:13.948]  Well, first of all, we continue to publish the truth.
[03:03:14.328 --> 03:03:14.989]  We don't back down.
[03:03:15.009 --> 03:03:16.089]  We don't compromise.
[03:03:16.109 --> 03:03:16.769]  That's number one.
[03:03:16.789 --> 03:03:24.772]  But we also have to expose the dangers to our democracy of the censorship that's being systematically rolled out by the tech giants.
[03:03:25.452 --> 03:03:35.255]  And we have to urge the president to understand that if we do not halt the censorship and allow public debate, then our democracy, it's over.
[03:03:35.855 --> 03:03:41.357]  And Trump will not win the 2020 election if this level of censorship continues.
[03:03:42.278 --> 03:03:46.379]  The very pillar of democracy and voting depends on people being able to debate.
[03:03:46.760 --> 03:03:49.681]  It depends on being able to hear ideas that you don't agree with.
[03:03:50.121 --> 03:03:51.221]  Sure, exactly.
[03:03:51.281 --> 03:03:52.622]  Whoever's censoring is the tyrant.
[03:03:52.642 --> 03:03:54.703]  So when we come back, I want to ask the question now.
[03:03:56.690 --> 03:03:57.411]  It's a paradox.
[03:03:57.571 --> 03:03:59.954]  I like a lot of what Trump's doing, and I don't want to attack him.
[03:03:59.994 --> 03:04:03.137]  I get he's under attack, but he won't listen if we don't attack.
[03:04:03.598 --> 03:04:09.705]  He, by not going after the censorship, that's more important than the border right now, because if we don't have speech, we ain't got nothing.
[03:04:11.427 --> 03:04:15.772]  Yeah, look, the radical left has built a wall around our minds.
[03:04:16.559 --> 03:04:20.422]  And that wall is fully funded and nothing is allowed to get through that wall.
[03:04:20.502 --> 03:04:22.424]  It's the social media content wall.
[03:04:22.844 --> 03:04:24.426]  It's like China's wall.
[03:04:24.866 --> 03:04:26.447]  It, you know, it's the Great Wall of China.
[03:04:26.507 --> 03:04:27.148]  Great Firewall.
[03:04:27.889 --> 03:04:28.749]  The Great Firewall, right.
[03:04:28.990 --> 03:04:44.282]  So this, walls are being used by the tech giants to stop us from learning information and yet then they oppose the wall of physical invasion of America because they want America to be invaded and overrun while the people are kept in the dark about the truth.
[03:04:45.063 --> 03:04:50.845]  Well, that's what's incredible is that things are so epic, Mike Adams, that I don't even have words to describe it.
[03:04:50.885 --> 03:04:53.526]  I mean, things are so insane.
[03:04:53.846 --> 03:04:56.087]  I just... It's all happening right now.
[03:04:56.127 --> 03:04:57.667]  This is the big choice right now.
[03:04:57.687 --> 03:04:58.107]  Stay with us.
[03:04:58.587 --> 03:05:00.168]  Mike Adams takes over in 60 seconds.
[03:05:05.069 --> 03:05:08.471]  For those looking for the ultimate source of energy for their day.
[03:05:08.751 --> 03:05:09.151]  Every day.
[03:05:09.551 --> 03:05:11.592]  The Brain Synergy Combo is here.
[03:05:12.012 --> 03:05:21.397]  Combining the powerful TurboForce and BrainForce Plus nootropic formulas, this combo has what you need to hit your maximum potential every day.
[03:05:21.797 --> 03:05:30.941]  Take the tasty tropical berry flavored TurboForce instant ring hits with you on the go or at work to help provide you with focus, clarity, and energy.
[03:05:31.301 --> 03:05:44.807]  And to reach your full potential, hit the next generation of advanced neural activation with the BrainForce Plus Nootobic, a fan-favorite formula fueled by powerful, time-tested ingredients for a true 360 win.
[03:05:45.447 --> 03:05:51.770]  With this combo, you can have energy wherever you need it, at home, on the go, in the car, and more.
[03:05:52.210 --> 03:05:58.293]  Get pure energy on tap and take advantage of old and new InfoWars powerhouse formulas
[03:05:59.093 --> 03:06:15.563]  Big Brother.
[03:06:16.044 --> 03:06:17.264]  Mainstream media.
[03:06:17.825 --> 03:06:18.945]  Government cover-ups.
[03:06:19.706 --> 03:06:21.167]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:06:21.427 --> 03:06:22.568]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:23.088 --> 03:06:27.791]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:31.687 --> 03:06:33.348]  You laugh at AOC.
[03:06:34.408 --> 03:06:41.652]  You laugh at Cortez wanting to shut the economy off and blow up houses every day and ban cows and ban airplanes.
[03:06:42.752 --> 03:06:44.773]  But there's an anti-human agenda at foot.
[03:06:45.734 --> 03:06:51.977]  A de-industrialization program meant to shut down our planetary boost phase to the stars and beyond.
[03:06:53.137 --> 03:06:55.798]  Mike Adams of naturalnews.com is about to take over.
[03:06:55.859 --> 03:07:00.701]  He's a skilled and savvy person and we're blessed to have people like him.
[03:07:02.028 --> 03:07:06.070]  But I will just leave you with this before the worm comes up in about 54 minutes.
[03:07:09.172 --> 03:07:10.873]  I talk about voting with your dollars.
[03:07:11.794 --> 03:07:14.415]  And I talk about the power of you taking action.
[03:07:14.475 --> 03:07:23.981]  But if you'll just buy... We already go out and get the very best Chiapas, High Mountain, Southern Mexico, around the border of Guatemala coffee.
[03:07:24.501 --> 03:07:26.763]  And we sell it for $10 less a pound than Whole Foods does.
[03:07:27.063 --> 03:07:28.384]  Make like $8, they make like $20.
[03:07:29.659 --> 03:07:32.520]  If you'll just go get our Fluoride-Free Toothpaste, Coiled Silver Iodine Fortified.
[03:07:32.540 --> 03:07:38.783]  If you'll just get our Protein Bars that are $2.40 apiece instead of $7, like Whole Foods sells them.
[03:07:39.064 --> 03:07:41.605]  It's the same bar, private label.
[03:07:42.665 --> 03:07:44.186]  Like, what's the best-selling bar in the country?
[03:07:44.546 --> 03:07:45.307]  Can we private label that?
[03:07:45.347 --> 03:07:45.927]  Yes, you can.
[03:07:46.107 --> 03:07:46.407]  We did it.
[03:07:47.188 --> 03:07:49.008]  That's on sale at m4store.com.
[03:07:49.409 --> 03:07:50.709]  No sales yet, just went up today.
[03:07:50.729 --> 03:07:52.490]  12 bars.
[03:07:54.251 --> 03:07:57.933]  In coconut, vanilla, or in chocolate peanut butter.
[03:07:58.846 --> 03:08:07.119]  If you'll just shop with us and support us and get the toothpaste, the coffee, the protein bars you need.
[03:08:07.139 --> 03:08:09.783]  Now we're like, Jones sells protein snake oil!
[03:08:11.370 --> 03:08:13.091]  For $2.40 a bar instead of $7.
[03:08:13.771 --> 03:08:15.632]  This is the best high-end bar.
[03:08:16.492 --> 03:08:17.392]  InfoWarsaw.com.
[03:08:17.432 --> 03:08:26.315]  If you'll just get your coffee, your toothpaste, and your bars from us, and sign up for auto-ship, conditional 10% off, our problems fighting Hillary and Soros are over.
[03:08:26.455 --> 03:08:27.696]  I want to produce news reports.
[03:08:28.156 --> 03:08:29.256]  I want to produce articles.
[03:08:29.416 --> 03:08:33.998]  I want to fight them and not run around trying to make money to fund the operation.
[03:08:34.018 --> 03:08:37.279]  So thank you for your support, but commit today to InfoWarsaw.com.
[03:08:37.739 --> 03:08:38.699]  I think so.
[03:08:59.949 --> 03:09:00.569]  It's symbiotic.
[03:09:00.589 --> 03:09:07.814]  I get my toothpaste, I get my coffee, I get my protein bar, and then it's all handled, and I get the best deal out there, and then I fund freedom.
[03:09:08.134 --> 03:09:08.554]  It's simple.
[03:09:08.995 --> 03:09:13.197]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsTore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:09:13.578 --> 03:09:18.901]  Mike Adams, for the next 50 minutes and 50 seconds, take over, and thanks for hosting, my friend.
[03:09:20.046 --> 03:09:21.667]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[03:09:21.907 --> 03:09:31.309]  And by the way, you know, what you're doing with offering these various products, you're really revolutionizing the entire business model of where people get the daily consumption products that they need.
[03:09:31.329 --> 03:09:40.552]  You know, people do vote with their dollars and they go out every day to a grocery store or convenience store or a retailer like Walmart, for example, and they buy things every day that they need.
[03:09:40.972 --> 03:09:46.114]  Well, as you keep rolling out products and your team is doing such an amazing job of doing that,
[03:09:46.778 --> 03:09:49.059]  You know, people are going to keep shifting to you.
[03:09:49.659 --> 03:09:57.081]  And, you know, your long-term strategy, it's obvious, this isn't insider information, it's just to offer more and more products that people use every day.
[03:09:57.482 --> 03:09:59.842]  And so people can vote for freedom and vote for liberty.
[03:10:00.143 --> 03:10:03.124]  You know, I find it astonishing that they attack you for selling water filters.
[03:10:03.644 --> 03:10:05.744]  I mean, who doesn't want clean water?
[03:10:06.265 --> 03:10:07.565]  And we know what's in the water.
[03:10:07.585 --> 03:10:13.067]  It's the pharmaceuticals, it's atrazine... Oh, David Hogg says, I'm secretly promoting it.
[03:10:13.107 --> 03:10:16.088]  No, I'm saying, the water's poisonous, here's great filters.
[03:10:17.117 --> 03:10:17.717]  Well, exactly.
[03:10:17.737 --> 03:10:25.819]  I mean, the scientific literature which I review every day is filled with stories about the toxic chemicals that are in tap water.
[03:10:26.259 --> 03:10:29.179]  Not just well water, but tap water, municipal water.
[03:10:29.219 --> 03:10:29.979]  It's filthy.
[03:10:30.460 --> 03:10:32.740]  It's contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals.
[03:10:33.140 --> 03:10:35.741]  Anybody drinking tap water is being brain poisoned.
[03:10:36.101 --> 03:10:43.082]  And I'm wondering if these radical leftists and these gun control whack jobs, if they are actually suffering
[03:10:43.822 --> 03:10:44.722]  Well, that's like in closing.
[03:11:10.563 --> 03:11:11.964]  Trump wants to pull out of these wars.
[03:11:12.004 --> 03:11:13.385]  Suddenly, Democrats are pro-war.
[03:11:14.465 --> 03:11:15.186]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:11:15.726 --> 03:11:16.146]  Exactly.
[03:11:16.206 --> 03:11:17.827]  The mask is coming off.
[03:11:18.227 --> 03:11:28.653]  Democrats, whom I have described as a death cult, they are now pro-baby murder, pro-dirty water, pro-war and colonization.
[03:11:29.274 --> 03:11:30.854]  They are anti-environment.
[03:11:30.934 --> 03:11:33.916]  They want to pollute the skies with the geoengineering.
[03:11:33.936 --> 03:11:35.897]  I mean, the list goes on and on, Alex.
[03:11:36.237 --> 03:11:37.478]  It's so insane.
[03:11:37.778 --> 03:11:38.759]  It's so out of control.
[03:11:39.359 --> 03:11:50.448]  And I don't mean this literally, this is a metaphor, but if an alien invading force were to try to come to Earth, as a metaphor, and destroy this planet, they would do exactly what the Democrats are doing.
[03:11:50.488 --> 03:11:51.209]  It's that bad.
[03:11:51.269 --> 03:11:52.490]  It's beyond terrorism.
[03:11:53.030 --> 03:11:54.592]  It's like planet destruction.
[03:11:54.992 --> 03:11:57.334]  It's like Death Star level death cult.
[03:11:57.754 --> 03:11:59.976]  This is what the Democrats have been prone to.
[03:11:59.996 --> 03:12:03.258]  And then you look at Democrats, no matter what color they are, they look like mutated
[03:12:04.102 --> 03:12:07.367]  Like idiots that just they act like bumbling morons.
[03:12:07.807 --> 03:12:11.793]  Like Alexandria Cortez literally is like a lobotomized weasel.
[03:12:13.254 --> 03:12:14.495]  You know what, I'm going to get into that today.
[03:12:14.895 --> 03:12:17.296]  I think your team just posted my story.
[03:12:17.376 --> 03:12:27.080]  It's a detailed analysis of how the AOC Green New Deal would collapse the national food supply and lead to mass starvation, Venezuela-style mass starvation.
[03:12:27.480 --> 03:12:37.345]  So what I'm going to do in this hour, Alex, is go through the details, the mathematical calculations, the agricultural use of fossil fuels, and really explain so people understand
[03:12:37.965 --> 03:12:38.926]  We're good to go.
[03:12:56.508 --> 03:13:00.509]  The FBI now looks like they have taken new action.
[03:13:00.529 --> 03:13:09.711]  I've talked to FFL dealers in America where they are now gathering information that can be used for a gun confiscation master list.
[03:13:10.271 --> 03:13:12.371]  And so I'm going to present that information.
[03:13:12.431 --> 03:13:20.173]  Very interested to hear from some of your listeners there who may be FFL dealers themselves and see if they're also hearing the same information.
[03:13:20.513 --> 03:13:24.354]  I will also talk about, as you mentioned, Alex, the Apple censorship
[03:13:24.975 --> 03:13:41.006]  The threats that we have received directly from Apple, where they are now emailing us at National News, they're emailing us screenshots of collections of articles that they say we cannot publish or they will ban our app from iPhones and Apple devices.
[03:13:42.087 --> 03:13:44.048]  And it's a game that they're playing.
[03:13:44.088 --> 03:13:48.151]  They won't tell us what keywords that they don't want.
[03:13:48.551 --> 03:13:53.154]  What they do is they send us screenshots, collections of articles, and say, well, these are offensive.
[03:13:53.494 --> 03:13:54.475]  You have to get rid of these.
[03:13:55.442 --> 03:13:57.283]  And we've tried a couple iterations with them.
[03:13:57.744 --> 03:14:03.468]  We would take certain words out of the search results and things, and we'd send them back, okay, check it now.
[03:14:03.488 --> 03:14:07.551]  But imagine, in the digital era, you're a newspaper that wants access to their platform.
[03:14:07.891 --> 03:14:09.112]  They say, this isn't allowed.
[03:14:09.933 --> 03:14:11.974]  They're lying to Congress, saying we're not censoring.
[03:14:12.034 --> 03:14:12.655]  Here it all is.
[03:14:13.946 --> 03:14:14.627]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:14:14.667 --> 03:14:21.274]  And one of the explanations from the Apple R&D person was astonishing.
[03:14:21.494 --> 03:14:25.618]  We were asking them, wait a minute, what's the reasoning behind all of this?
[03:14:26.138 --> 03:14:32.485]  And they literally said that, well, we don't allow articles that are intended to promote disgust.
[03:14:33.391 --> 03:14:34.051]  Disgust.
[03:14:34.572 --> 03:14:36.593]  D-I-S-G-U-S.
[03:14:36.893 --> 03:14:38.374]  You know, a disgusting reaction.
[03:14:38.394 --> 03:14:43.156]  If you're disgusted by killing a newborn baby or you're disgusted by Hitler, that's not allowed.
[03:14:43.176 --> 03:14:46.878]  They want you all pacified, nothing but good news, go to sleep.
[03:14:47.018 --> 03:14:47.398]  You got it.
[03:14:47.899 --> 03:14:50.440]  So if you love abortion, you're okay.
[03:14:51.060 --> 03:14:55.983]  If you say, well, abortion is the murder of a child that could live outside the womb.
[03:14:56.003 --> 03:14:56.883]  This is a massacre.
[03:14:56.923 --> 03:14:59.765]  This is the disassembling of the limbs of a human child.
[03:15:00.305 --> 03:15:02.045]  They'll say, well, that's disgusting.
[03:15:02.385 --> 03:15:03.206]  You can't say that.
[03:15:03.386 --> 03:15:04.186]  Well, wait a second!
[03:15:05.086 --> 03:15:08.607]  All your other approved channels are saying that Trump is an evil demon or whatever.
[03:15:09.427 --> 03:15:11.627]  Isn't that intended to create disgust?
[03:15:12.347 --> 03:15:14.888]  And they say, well... What you're saying is we can't raise the alarm.
[03:15:15.408 --> 03:15:18.208]  The left can demonize families, health, everything.
[03:15:19.088 --> 03:15:21.149]  Cell phones, you know, radiation, it's all good.
[03:15:21.489 --> 03:15:25.270]  But if we say it's a problem, it's warning people they're saying it's illegal.
[03:15:26.350 --> 03:15:27.630]  So truth is hate speech.
[03:15:28.598 --> 03:15:36.572]  A true clinical detailed analysis of abortion is now hate speech, but murdering babies is love and acceptance and progressivism.
[03:15:37.373 --> 03:15:41.495]  If you say there are only two genders, gender is binary, oh, that's hate speech!
[03:15:42.035 --> 03:15:48.138]  Even though that's the truth of biology that has been evident since the beginning of mankind, you know.
[03:15:48.438 --> 03:15:52.020]  But if you say that, you are an evil person now, according to Apple.
[03:15:52.040 --> 03:15:54.441]  It's an attack on reality, an attack on free speech.
[03:15:54.881 --> 03:15:57.442]  Mike Adams takes over at naturalnews.com.
[03:15:57.902 --> 03:15:59.803]  Straight ahead, this is the InfoWar.
[03:16:00.423 --> 03:16:01.244]  We are all in your hands.
[03:16:01.264 --> 03:16:01.784]  Spread the links.
[03:16:02.744 --> 03:16:10.089]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best selling, highest rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[03:16:10.710 --> 03:16:16.534]  And a lot of times we reach out to top companies and they don't want to private label to us because, well, we're InfoWars and we've been demonized.
[03:16:16.594 --> 03:16:20.877]  But a lot of times people will work with us only because we're InfoWars.
[03:16:21.477 --> 03:16:37.068]  Well, there is a national company, and I'm not going to name them because we're not in competition with them, but we probably label the product, who has FDA approval for years to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there until you get to prescription level of wound gel that can be sold in stores.
[03:16:37.728 --> 03:16:44.614]  And we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[03:16:45.175 --> 03:16:46.816]  But the announcement here today is this.
[03:16:47.517 --> 03:16:51.000]  We've been selling a lot of the Wombshell and a lot of the Immune Garden.
[03:16:51.440 --> 03:16:53.722]  In fact, we just put in big orders for both of them.
[03:16:54.483 --> 03:17:05.236]  But then I noticed without us even plugging it, because of all the scary stuff going on this winter with viruses and bacteria spreading at record levels, that it was all flying off the shelves at regular price.
[03:17:05.897 --> 03:17:11.604]  And so unlike other companies and other groups that do things like raise prices during a crisis,
[03:17:12.205 --> 03:17:20.814]  We're going to go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:17:21.274 --> 03:17:22.175]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:17:22.535 --> 03:17:26.459]  We're going to go to 40% off because I just put a big order in.
[03:17:26.760 --> 03:17:32.405]  It'll be a few months till more comes in, but I want you to have the impetus and the initiative to get it for yourself and your family.
[03:17:33.166 --> 03:17:36.528]  Get a great discount, see how great it works, and become a repeat customer.
[03:17:36.788 --> 03:17:41.471]  It's just as a Texan, and as American, and as a patriot, that's how I want to be treated.
[03:17:41.971 --> 03:17:49.255]  That when there's a crisis, if people really need something and want it, I'm going to sell it at a huge discount instead of selling it at full price because I noticed you were buying it.
[03:17:49.595 --> 03:18:00.121]  So because you're supporting us and already buying it, both the products, 40% off as a combo, or 40% off individually, while supplies last, at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:18:06.431 --> 03:18:07.171]  Let's go to Debbie.
[03:18:07.712 --> 03:18:08.692]  Debbie in New Jersey.
[03:18:08.732 --> 03:18:09.512]  Debbie, thanks for calling.
[03:18:09.532 --> 03:18:10.353]  I really appreciate you.
[03:18:10.693 --> 03:18:11.173]  Go ahead, Debbie.
[03:18:11.313 --> 03:18:17.316]  The shifting of Nancy Pelosi with those dentures, I wanted to just slap that bitch right across the mouth.
[03:18:17.396 --> 03:18:18.877]  I'm so sick of her ugly face.
[03:18:19.157 --> 03:18:19.637]  I am too.
[03:18:19.677 --> 03:18:20.457]  God, she's a demon.
[03:18:20.697 --> 03:18:22.218]  It's not about hating them.
[03:18:22.278 --> 03:18:23.919]  For me, it's about, it's embarrassing.
[03:18:23.959 --> 03:18:29.401]  Like, how do we have a group of people this bad, this evil, this stupid ruling over us?
[03:18:29.661 --> 03:18:30.642]  It makes me feel like crap.
[03:18:30.882 --> 03:18:31.522]  You know what, Alex?
[03:18:31.542 --> 03:18:34.484]  It's because we're on such an elevated plane.
[03:18:34.764 --> 03:18:42.607]  The people who are awake, we're so elevated in this dimension that it sickens us and makes us so ill physically.
[03:18:42.667 --> 03:18:49.910]  It's just, it's so hard to look at people like that and want to even be kind to them because they just turn your frickin' stomach.
[03:18:49.970 --> 03:18:56.913]  But, um, the other thing I wanted to say is, Cortez, she looks like a rabid Austin Terrier with those bulging eyeballs of hers, too.
[03:18:57.473 --> 03:18:58.574]  She really is demonic.
[03:18:58.974 --> 03:19:07.317]  You know, we can laugh about her, and I do, but it's like Beto and that, in his fake voice and how corrupt he is, it's like, this is their superstars?
[03:19:08.077 --> 03:19:10.538]  Beto O'Rourke and Alexandria Cortez?
[03:19:10.578 --> 03:19:11.819]  These people are idiots!
[03:19:12.259 --> 03:19:13.880]  And I'm not trying to be mean, it's just true!
[03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:14.240]  Yeah.
[03:19:15.220 --> 03:19:15.740]  Yeah, no, it is.
[03:19:15.921 --> 03:19:16.121]  It is.
[03:19:16.421 --> 03:19:30.631]  Um, Alex, I'm gonna let you go, but I want to let you know that my husband and I have every t-shirt, every product, because we love you, we love the InfoWarriors, and everybody there that works there, we really think the world of you people, and we are also lifetime Oath Keepers.
[03:19:30.851 --> 03:19:31.692]  Thank you, Stuart Rose.
[03:19:31.772 --> 03:19:32.172]  We love you.
[03:19:32.212 --> 03:19:32.472]  Thank you.
[03:19:32.512 --> 03:19:33.353]  Well, God bless you, Debbie.
[03:19:33.433 --> 03:19:34.494]  And let me just say this.
[03:19:34.694 --> 03:19:41.439]  I was in meetings this morning with accountants at the lawsuits they've got against us, and we beat, like, 15 of them, so they filed, like, five more.
[03:19:42.459 --> 03:19:44.361]  And I was just looking at this, and it was like,
[03:19:45.533 --> 03:19:50.454]  The enemy turns up the heat, you give us product purchases that just meet the level we need.
[03:19:50.614 --> 03:19:51.915]  We need financial support, folks.
[03:19:51.955 --> 03:19:55.256]  So I need everybody to go to m4restore.com and just realize that it's a war.
[03:19:55.296 --> 03:19:59.437]  Just find your war bonds and get the toothpaste, get the coffee, get it all, and just take action.
[03:19:59.577 --> 03:20:00.417]  m4restore.com.
[03:20:00.437 --> 03:20:00.837]  Stay with us.
[03:20:06.239 --> 03:20:08.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.239 --> 03:20:23.142]  You found it.
[03:20:23.483 --> 03:20:24.967]  The tip of the spear.
[03:20:25.528 --> 03:20:30.100]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[03:20:33.559 --> 03:20:34.260]  Alright, welcome back.
[03:20:34.300 --> 03:20:39.086]  Mike Adams stepping in here as the guest host for the rest of this hour here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:39.306 --> 03:20:48.598]  I've got a detailed analysis to go over with you today about the Green New Deal and how it would lead to a catastrophic food collapse across America.
[03:20:49.118 --> 03:20:50.460]  Mass starvation.
[03:20:50.940 --> 03:20:52.663]  Venezuela-style mass starvation.
[03:20:53.608 --> 03:21:02.201]  With accompanying economic collapse, the outbreaks of infectious disease, civil unrest, total chaos, total collapse across America.
[03:21:02.681 --> 03:21:07.969]  So this is the result that would happen if they ban fossil fuels and ban the combustion engine.
[03:21:08.049 --> 03:21:09.411]  And to understand this is very simple.
[03:21:10.086 --> 03:21:13.610]  We can start with understanding how fossil fuels are used in food production.
[03:21:13.990 --> 03:21:15.993]  So this story is up on InfoWars.com.
[03:21:16.013 --> 03:21:19.417]  Now, there's a detailed infographic that's part of this story.
[03:21:19.737 --> 03:21:21.479]  I encourage you to check out the infographic.
[03:21:21.919 --> 03:21:22.660]  Feel free to share it.
[03:21:23.061 --> 03:21:24.182]  But let's start with some basics.
[03:21:26.087 --> 03:21:34.891]  Green energy, solar and wind power, is effective at powering things that are connected to the grid, hardwired to the grid.
[03:21:35.272 --> 03:21:45.317]  So you can augment the power grid with green energy if you're powering homes or businesses, because homes and businesses stand still, right?
[03:21:45.417 --> 03:21:47.738]  They don't run around the farm field.
[03:21:47.778 --> 03:21:51.380]  They don't roll down the highway, except if you're moving a mobile home or something.
[03:21:51.420 --> 03:21:55.622]  But almost all homes and businesses and commercial buildings are, of course, standing still.
[03:21:56.368 --> 03:22:00.611]  So the grid is easy to connect to them, and it's easy to feed that grid with green energy.
[03:22:01.311 --> 03:22:23.566]  But for mobile equipment, which is what's used in agriculture, tractors, harvesters, combines, big rigs that deliver fuel, food processing equipment that's mobile, all these things cannot be powered by solar or wind for the simple reason that batteries don't have the energy density that's necessary to power these devices.
[03:22:24.201 --> 03:22:25.841]  We did some interesting math on this.
[03:22:26.161 --> 03:22:27.922]  You'll love this comparison.
[03:22:28.742 --> 03:22:30.262]  A hundred horsepower tractor.
[03:22:30.903 --> 03:22:34.243]  Just take a hundred horsepower tractor, which is not even that powerful of a tractor.
[03:22:34.263 --> 03:22:36.064]  It's kind of a mid-sized tractor.
[03:22:36.904 --> 03:22:45.186]  You would have to, to power that tractor with a solar panel, you would have to attach to the top of that tractor 5,000 square feet of solar panels.
[03:22:45.206 --> 03:22:45.806]  5,000 square feet.
[03:22:50.419 --> 03:23:00.862]  We did the math on that, it's based on an average of 15 watts per square foot of solar PV panels.
[03:23:01.302 --> 03:23:06.924]  So if you do that, if you do the math, then it's 70 feet by 70 feet square.
[03:23:07.784 --> 03:23:19.627]  And that's how big of a massive solar array you would have to put on top of a tractor in order to power that tractor with the same energy as a 100 horsepower diesel engine.
[03:23:20.228 --> 03:23:30.520]  Now, of course, if you're a farmer, if you know anything about agriculture, you know you can't drive around with a tractor with a 70 foot wide and a 70 foot long solar panel attached to the top of it.
[03:23:31.286 --> 03:23:31.546]  Why?
[03:23:31.887 --> 03:23:34.008]  Well, for one reason, it would tip over.
[03:23:34.468 --> 03:23:49.680]  And for a second reason, you go on the slightest incline, and it would also tip over, or from the wind, and you couldn't even get close to any tree or any obstacle that is, because, you know, you couldn't get within 35 or 40 feet of any obstacle because you have the 70-foot-wide solar panel.
[03:23:50.080 --> 03:23:50.741]  But even worse,
[03:23:51.471 --> 03:23:57.853]  The panel couldn't really be tilted at the right angle, so you could only farm in the summer, not the spring and not really the fall.
[03:23:58.373 --> 03:24:04.635]  And you couldn't really farm in northern latitudes, because you don't have much sunlight and you can't run your tractor after dark.
[03:24:05.255 --> 03:24:06.455]  Now, think about this.
[03:24:07.595 --> 03:24:17.078]  See, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks in fairy tales and delusions and crazy, you know, dreams and leprechauns and unicorns.
[03:24:17.990 --> 03:24:20.113]  I'm talking to you in reality here.
[03:24:20.654 --> 03:24:21.735]  I'm a food scientist.
[03:24:21.835 --> 03:24:23.197]  I run a food science lab.
[03:24:23.738 --> 03:24:25.140]  We can do the math on this.
[03:24:25.580 --> 03:24:27.343]  So I went to the, it's called the U.S.
[03:24:27.463 --> 03:24:32.730]  Energy Information Administration, and we looked up the fossil fuel use in agriculture.
[03:24:33.368 --> 03:24:46.215]  Turns out that there are 500 trillion BTUs of energy expended to grow food crops, not even counting livestock, just the food crops, every year in America.
[03:24:46.235 --> 03:24:49.517]  And those are numbers from, I think, 2012, so it's much larger now.
[03:24:49.537 --> 03:24:51.599]  500 trillion BTUs.
[03:24:52.379 --> 03:24:53.600]  That comes from fossil fuels.
[03:24:54.140 --> 03:24:56.301]  Because, obviously, you have to have all that equipment.
[03:24:56.381 --> 03:24:58.282]  You have to have the transportation equipment.
[03:24:58.302 --> 03:25:00.844]  You have to have the tractors and everything else I mentioned.
[03:25:01.701 --> 03:25:08.104]  Livestock production requires another 300 trillion BTUs of fossil fuel energy.
[03:25:08.964 --> 03:25:12.145]  Now, I mean, most of it is fossil fuels.
[03:25:12.586 --> 03:25:17.928]  A small part of that is electricity, but almost all of it is fossil fuels because
[03:25:18.740 --> 03:25:22.543]  Fossil fuels, again, power things that are not connected to the grid.
[03:25:23.023 --> 03:25:27.646]  Now, how are you going to replace that with green energy?
[03:25:27.947 --> 03:25:32.550]  Because Ocasio-Cortez wants to say that no more fossil fuels in 10 years.
[03:25:33.070 --> 03:25:35.572]  And by the way, that means no more combustion engines.
[03:25:36.032 --> 03:25:38.374]  So here's a question for sensible people.
[03:25:39.114 --> 03:25:46.740]  How are you going to sail ships that carry containers across the ocean without combustion engines and ship fuel?
[03:25:48.707 --> 03:25:51.028]  Does she want us to go back to wooden ships with sails?
[03:25:51.568 --> 03:25:56.430]  Is the Green New Deal really, basically, should we just call it the 1700s again?
[03:25:56.890 --> 03:25:58.030]  Let's relive the 1700s.
[03:25:58.991 --> 03:25:59.851]  Because that's what she wants.
[03:25:59.951 --> 03:26:01.111]  Wooden ships with sails.
[03:26:02.392 --> 03:26:05.793]  But, you know, it's insane.
[03:26:05.813 --> 03:26:08.594]  You don't even have commercial jets under this scenario either.
[03:26:08.794 --> 03:26:10.174]  So how are you going to fly food?
[03:26:10.514 --> 03:26:11.975]  You know, seafood that's flown in.
[03:26:11.995 --> 03:26:12.815]  How are you going to fly that?
[03:26:14.122 --> 03:26:17.744]  How are you going to produce any food at all without combustion engines?
[03:26:17.984 --> 03:26:19.705]  And the answer is, you can't.
[03:26:21.066 --> 03:26:27.210]  No ships, no planes, no tractors, no long-haul rigs on the highways.
[03:26:27.270 --> 03:26:31.652]  I know they're experimenting with some battery-powered trucks, but their range is almost nothing.
[03:26:32.393 --> 03:26:34.394]  And they're not in mass production, not even close.
[03:26:35.114 --> 03:26:39.917]  And you can never have enough battery energy density in tractors and agricultural equipment.
[03:26:40.399 --> 03:26:41.720]  Because the energy density is just not there.
[03:26:41.740 --> 03:26:46.281]  Unless you have a quantum leap in battery technology, you can't do that.
[03:26:47.422 --> 03:26:58.426]  So food production, by my estimates, would plummet as much as 80% in the United States within 12 months after the Green New Deal goes into effect.
[03:26:58.907 --> 03:27:04.669]  If you ban combustion engines, you cause a near total collapse of food production in America.
[03:27:05.149 --> 03:27:09.231]  Even worse, you can't even import food from China or
[03:27:10.177 --> 03:27:10.997]  South America.
[03:27:11.597 --> 03:27:14.798]  A lot of food comes from South America, especially during the winter months in America.
[03:27:15.118 --> 03:27:16.018]  Well, how does that get here?
[03:27:16.518 --> 03:27:22.280]  By expending fossil fuels for diesel trucks or ships that bring that food to us.
[03:27:22.680 --> 03:27:26.020]  But according to Ocasio-Cortez, you can't use combustion engines.
[03:27:26.420 --> 03:27:34.042]  Would she also ban food imports that rely on the use of fossil fuels to power those ships and trucks and planes?
[03:27:34.402 --> 03:27:37.963]  Or is Ocasio-Cortez's idea that only America
[03:27:38.775 --> 03:27:42.499]  Would ban combustion engines, but all the other countries in the world can continue to use them.
[03:27:42.800 --> 03:27:44.482]  Because trust me, they would.
[03:27:44.862 --> 03:27:47.405]  China is not stupid enough to ban combustion engines.
[03:27:47.886 --> 03:27:50.909]  Russia is not stupid enough to ban combustion engines.
[03:27:51.230 --> 03:27:54.814]  And by the way, does Ocasio-Cortez's ban, does it also include the military?
[03:27:55.532 --> 03:28:07.360]  Would she say that the military will not be allowed to operate tanks, planes, transport trucks, armored personnel carriers, logistics deliveries, all fuel depots should be shut down?
[03:28:07.900 --> 03:28:08.821]  Is this her plan?
[03:28:09.161 --> 03:28:10.682]  Because it's a plan of lunacy!
[03:28:11.903 --> 03:28:16.006]  These are idiotic, moronic ideas from the radical left.
[03:28:16.086 --> 03:28:17.607]  They are beyond stupid.
[03:28:17.627 --> 03:28:19.208]  They show a level of economic
[03:28:19.913 --> 03:28:22.736]  Illiteracy that is astonishing.
[03:28:22.836 --> 03:28:23.577]  It is stunning.
[03:28:23.997 --> 03:28:27.941]  And it really underscores the need for basic IQ testing for members of Congress.
[03:28:28.542 --> 03:28:34.307]  If you don't IQ test these people from now on, how do you make sure you don't get another Ocasio-Cortez in the mix?
[03:28:35.008 --> 03:28:36.429]  She wants to destroy America.
[03:28:36.489 --> 03:28:37.691]  She's got a plan to do it.
[03:28:38.191 --> 03:28:40.493]  And other Democrats have signed on to that plan.
[03:28:41.034 --> 03:28:42.155]  They are a death cult.
[03:28:42.890 --> 03:28:49.516]  And they will not stop until they absolutely gut this country and bring down an apocalyptic collapse upon us.
[03:28:50.357 --> 03:28:51.217]  And there's more straight ahead.
[03:28:51.237 --> 03:28:52.338]  That's not the end of this story.
[03:28:52.639 --> 03:28:54.240]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:54.260 --> 03:28:55.521]  This is Mike Adams filling in.
[03:28:55.882 --> 03:28:57.983]  We'll be back after this break with more analysis.
[03:28:58.063 --> 03:28:58.444]  Stay with us.
[03:29:04.423 --> 03:29:06.565]  At its regular price, it's a little over $3.
[03:29:07.526 --> 03:29:10.729]  When we have it discounted, it's about $2.50 a piece.
[03:29:12.411 --> 03:29:15.994]  Comparable bars are between $5 and $7 a piece at Whole Foods.
[03:29:16.394 --> 03:29:17.155]  This is high-end.
[03:29:17.796 --> 03:29:21.019]  When you get one box, you get them at basically $3.
[03:29:21.059 --> 03:29:25.143]  You get them for $2.50 or so when you get it at the current launch discount.
[03:29:25.743 --> 03:29:34.188]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturing developer in the country to get it all ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this.
[03:29:34.628 --> 03:29:36.929]  It's available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:29:37.069 --> 03:29:37.450]  It's simple.
[03:29:37.470 --> 03:29:43.073]  You get the highest quality protein bars in two different flavors and you fund the war against the globalists.
[03:29:43.593 --> 03:29:45.615]  And the attempt that we're engaged in to take the country back.
[03:29:45.955 --> 03:29:46.375]  It's simple.
[03:29:46.875 --> 03:29:52.559]  Go shop with the good guys at InfoWarsStore.com and break the back of the globalists and get high quality, super discounts.
[03:29:52.839 --> 03:29:59.824]  Or keep shopping with Jeff Bezos and Amazon and keep going to Whole Foods that are actually funding the Washington Post and the globalists' attempt to destroy this country.
[03:30:00.185 --> 03:30:00.805]  It's that simple.
[03:30:01.185 --> 03:30:02.066]  InfoWarsLife.com
[03:30:09.087 --> 03:30:13.065]  This isn't words, because everybody hears hype and there's thousands of channels and...
[03:30:14.383 --> 03:30:15.684]  This is the channel they're trying to shut down.
[03:30:16.104 --> 03:30:17.064]  This is what they don't want on there.
[03:30:17.224 --> 03:30:18.485]  This is the wild card.
[03:30:18.645 --> 03:30:22.027]  Time and time again, when nobody else is covering it, we're covering it.
[03:30:22.167 --> 03:30:23.627]  It breaks out, and it defeats them.
[03:30:23.827 --> 03:30:27.309]  So, if you want to defeat the globalists, just keep doing what you've already been doing.
[03:30:27.369 --> 03:30:32.691]  Remember that, yeah, you can get censored or banned on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook for promoting it at fullwars.com links.
[03:30:32.731 --> 03:30:33.332]  We make it easier.
[03:30:33.412 --> 03:30:34.292]  Promote a News Wars link.
[03:30:34.392 --> 03:30:36.093]  That doesn't get you banned 10% as much.
[03:30:36.113 --> 03:30:36.833]  But who cares?
[03:30:37.213 --> 03:30:39.855]  They built these platforms to get us in there like a web.
[03:30:40.675 --> 03:30:46.596]  So the spires would have us caught, and come up and say, do what we say or we'll not let you talk to people.
[03:30:47.608 --> 03:30:49.569]  And you go, okay, and they tie her in the web.
[03:30:50.410 --> 03:30:52.872]  And then pretty soon it's like, you can't get free now.
[03:30:53.252 --> 03:30:54.773]  Mmm, delicious.
[03:30:55.313 --> 03:31:08.562]  And that's exactly who Jack Dorsey and all these people are, smart-ass spiders that all screw each other and lie and just, oh yeah, we've got a Bitcoin pump and dump.
[03:31:08.682 --> 03:31:14.326]  I dumped my stock before it plunged, and now I'm gonna sucker you back in for square cash.
[03:31:19.577 --> 03:31:20.858]  That's how the spider operates.
[03:31:20.978 --> 03:31:22.680]  We gotta learn to recognize the spider.
[03:31:22.780 --> 03:31:24.481]  It's in love with itself.
[03:31:24.782 --> 03:31:25.662]  It's fallen.
[03:31:25.903 --> 03:31:29.125]  And it's so sure of itself and how it can destroy everything around it.
[03:31:29.185 --> 03:31:30.807]  But we're here to say no.
[03:31:31.027 --> 03:31:39.674]  InfoWars has been chosen out of the spectrum of resistance because it's one of the leading lights.
[03:31:41.260 --> 03:31:42.701]  The spiders don't like light.
[03:31:42.961 --> 03:31:43.521]  They like dark.
[03:31:44.222 --> 03:31:51.586]  And so if they're able, they believe, to shut us down, they believe they've killed a major nexus point for human expression and human freedom.
[03:31:51.947 --> 03:31:55.389]  The Lord works in mysterious ways, but I can tell you this.
[03:31:55.609 --> 03:32:03.394]  The fact that we're persecuted shows we're over the target, and we just have to hold on a few more years into the future for things we're going to do that
[03:32:03.834 --> 03:32:07.556]  Don't just give us the big victories you've already delivered, Blisters, by supporting us.
[03:32:07.636 --> 03:32:08.377]  We're all in this together.
[03:32:08.437 --> 03:32:13.760]  But to even bigger victories that make what humanity's got to go through a lot easier.
[03:32:13.940 --> 03:32:15.561]  And I realize that's the commitment.
[03:32:15.621 --> 03:32:22.725]  If I'm willing to go all the way, and if you're willing to go all the way, there's going to be major dividends for our children and for society and culture.
[03:32:22.845 --> 03:32:28.509]  Where, you know, only a billion people are going to die in this Armageddon instead of, like, seven billion.
[03:32:29.169 --> 03:32:31.391]  I mean, seriously, like, it's kind of choose your adventure.
[03:32:32.171 --> 03:32:39.914]  If we really get involved now and say no to all this up front, then we're going to go through this metamorphosis and it's going to be rough, but it'll be okay.
[03:32:40.694 --> 03:32:45.736]  If we don't, I tell you, it's a very, very hard road we're going down.
[03:32:46.356 --> 03:32:50.638]  And so I would just ask everybody to really search their heart and soul and commit to this fight.
[03:32:50.658 --> 03:32:51.998]  And thank you all for your financial support.
[03:32:52.238 --> 03:32:54.359]  That's Beyond Critical and FullRestore.com.
[03:33:06.187 --> 03:33:08.911]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.641 --> 03:33:18.644]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:19.064 --> 03:33:22.969]  It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:33:27.578 --> 03:33:35.361]  One thing that we know about Democrats is not only are they economically illiterate and scientifically illiterate, they're also illiterate about history.
[03:33:36.101 --> 03:33:37.141]  They never study history.
[03:33:37.682 --> 03:33:39.762]  That's not even taught in the liberal schools anymore.
[03:33:39.782 --> 03:33:43.904]  They just teach social justice, victimhood, cry bully behavior.
[03:33:44.524 --> 03:33:56.695]  And so when you look at this Green New Deal from Ocasio-Cortez, you understand that she has no knowledge of history and the rise of food production and agricultural mechanization.
[03:33:56.715 --> 03:33:58.356]  So I'm going to cover that just briefly here.
[03:33:58.877 --> 03:34:00.518]  Let's take a little history journey together.
[03:34:01.058 --> 03:34:02.460]  If you go back to the 1700s and earlier,
[03:34:04.708 --> 03:34:13.516]  Much of the world was based on an agrarian society, an agrarian structure where a very high percentage of the population was engaged in food production.
[03:34:13.936 --> 03:34:20.041]  Because food production was not automated, there were not fossil fuel powered combustion engines.
[03:34:20.522 --> 03:34:29.990]  They had early steam tractors and things like that in the 1800s, some experimental tractors, but most of the power there was animal power, horsepower, and oxen.
[03:34:30.590 --> 03:34:43.681]  You know, when I was in Peru a few years ago, I actually got to see people planting potatoes at high altitude just by having these incredible beasts, these ox, you know, pulling wooden plows.
[03:34:44.361 --> 03:34:46.023]  And that's a hard way to grow food.
[03:34:46.303 --> 03:34:47.424]  There's nothing easy about that.
[03:34:48.004 --> 03:34:58.213]  And because it's difficult to grow food in an agrarian, non-mechanized kind of society, you don't have enough abundant food for a population explosion to occur.
[03:34:59.028 --> 03:35:05.611]  This is why there was no population explosion on Earth, you know, from, you know, A.D.
[03:35:05.711 --> 03:35:11.294]  year one, all the way up to, frankly, about the mid-1700s or late 1700s.
[03:35:11.354 --> 03:35:21.879]  The real explosion has only taken place in the last hundred plus years, a little bit more than a hundred years, because of the mechanization of food production.
[03:35:22.379 --> 03:35:41.947]  And so as combustion engines came into play with tractors in the early part of the 20th century, especially is where they really started to catch on, and you had farming become more and more efficient, where instead of one person, as in the 1700s, one person could maybe produce food for two or three people.
[03:35:42.447 --> 03:35:45.608]  So you could literally have half of society involved in food production.
[03:35:46.152 --> 03:35:53.161]  Well now, because of the mass mechanization and automation of agriculture, you only have maybe one farmer out of a hundred people.
[03:35:53.602 --> 03:35:56.726]  So one farmer can feed the other 99 out of a hundred people.
[03:35:57.126 --> 03:35:58.969]  Because you have this magnification,
[03:35:59.906 --> 03:36:00.867]  We're good to go.
[03:36:27.484 --> 03:36:27.764]  We're good.
[03:36:48.343 --> 03:36:58.313]  High number of people on the planet currently and continuing to grow is because of the very same combustion engines that Ocasio-Cortez wants to outlaw.
[03:36:59.094 --> 03:36:59.995]  She wants to ban them.
[03:37:00.596 --> 03:37:04.820]  The result would be a collapse of modern society back to the 1700s.
[03:37:06.574 --> 03:37:20.145]  In that scenario, you would see massive, widespread starvation, a catastrophic collapse of the food supply, and all the disease and societal collapse and social unrest, lawlessness, political collapse.
[03:37:20.205 --> 03:37:21.846]  The United States of America would collapse.
[03:37:22.707 --> 03:37:25.389]  And it would make America vulnerable to invasion by other countries.
[03:37:26.434 --> 03:37:27.114]  You know, here's another note.
[03:37:27.374 --> 03:37:34.478]  You notice that even with the climate taxes and the climate change pushers, they always want to say, well, America should lead the way.
[03:37:34.538 --> 03:37:38.420]  So let's crack down on CO2 emissions for America only.
[03:37:38.720 --> 03:37:39.880]  Let's tax America.
[03:37:40.320 --> 03:37:41.801]  Let's block America's industry.
[03:37:41.861 --> 03:37:48.684]  But you notice those laws never apply to China or India, where the vast amount of pollution is actually taking place.
[03:37:49.084 --> 03:37:49.905]  I mean, China pollutes
[03:37:50.485 --> 03:37:57.348]  Far more than the United States now in terms of the quality and quantity of its toxins that it's releasing into the atmosphere.
[03:37:58.349 --> 03:37:59.169]  And India as well.
[03:37:59.749 --> 03:38:01.930]  Well, think about this Green New Deal from AOC.
[03:38:02.491 --> 03:38:04.852]  This is also something to apply only to America.
[03:38:05.852 --> 03:38:18.378]  Ocasio-Cortez wants to cripple America only, to make America non-competitive, to crush America's GDP, to decimate America's farming and agricultural operations.
[03:38:19.082 --> 03:38:30.008]  To eliminate the food supply, to starve the population, but she would not demand banning combustion engines in China or Mexico, for that matter, or any other country in the world.
[03:38:30.048 --> 03:38:33.990]  So this is, yet again, targeting America for specific destruction.
[03:38:34.711 --> 03:38:42.755]  Essentially, if I were to summarize this, I would say that the Green New Deal is the blueprint of a massive Democrat-led act of
[03:38:43.647 --> 03:38:46.968]  Economic terrorism against the United States of America.
[03:38:47.509 --> 03:38:53.251]  It is economic terrorism being led by a death cult that we call Democrats.
[03:38:54.171 --> 03:38:54.992]  They are a death cult.
[03:38:55.052 --> 03:39:03.435]  Now, Cory Booker today, I believe this was today, maybe it was yesterday, he said that we cannot support livestock anymore on this planet.
[03:39:04.335 --> 03:39:08.637]  Once again, showing Cory Booker's incredible ignorance about agriculture.
[03:39:09.424 --> 03:39:23.293]  I live in Texas and we see a lot of cows all over the place and you know I take care of donkeys on my ranch as well and I have Nigerian dwarf goats and free-range chickens as well.
[03:39:23.314 --> 03:39:28.057]  I harvest my own chicken eggs and you know we we do a lot of things around animals.
[03:39:28.537 --> 03:39:31.279]  Now if you start to observe cattle
[03:39:31.966 --> 03:39:32.906]  And cattle operations.
[03:39:33.026 --> 03:39:41.109]  You come to realize that, in fact, cows are one of the most efficient producers of food, requiring the fewest inputs.
[03:39:41.709 --> 03:39:45.370]  Cows can turn horrible land into food.
[03:39:46.090 --> 03:39:49.471]  Because cows, obviously, they will roam around on their own.
[03:39:50.032 --> 03:39:52.832]  They will go out and find the weeds and find the grass.
[03:39:53.133 --> 03:39:54.973]  They'll even go find their own water.
[03:39:55.013 --> 03:40:00.855]  Well, you got to give them a, you know, a tank to drink from, but they'll, they'll make their way to that water and then they'll go back out and harvest more food.
[03:40:01.920 --> 03:40:07.503]  Cows can turn land that is essentially useless into usable food.
[03:40:08.344 --> 03:40:19.290]  And I'm talking about free range cows here, not like CAFO, you know, cattle factory operations, which I oppose in principle because of the extreme, you know, dirtiness and cruelty of it.
[03:40:19.330 --> 03:40:25.354]  But I'm talking about free range cows, which are really, frankly, quite clean in what they're consuming.
[03:40:25.734 --> 03:40:27.135]  And they're very, very efficient.
[03:40:27.839 --> 03:40:35.566]  You can unleash cows in West Texas or parts of Nevada or Utah or even parts of Arizona where you can't grow anything else.
[03:40:36.086 --> 03:40:37.167]  You can't grow soybeans.
[03:40:37.507 --> 03:40:38.328]  You can't grow corn.
[03:40:38.348 --> 03:40:40.530]  You can't grow wheat, oats, nothing.
[03:40:41.111 --> 03:40:50.719]  It's useless land for vegetable crops or fruit crops, but you can unleash cows on that land and those cows will go out and gather the energy and create the food.
[03:40:51.907 --> 03:40:58.709]  And that's why cows are actually one of the most, believe it or not, eco-friendly sources of food production.
[03:40:59.109 --> 03:41:01.670]  That's why if you look at the statistics that I quoted, what is it?
[03:41:01.810 --> 03:41:02.551]  The U.S.
[03:41:02.631 --> 03:41:03.851]  Energy Information Administration.
[03:41:04.371 --> 03:41:10.033]  There are more BTUs of energy that go into vegetable production than into livestock production.
[03:41:11.058 --> 03:41:11.839]  That's not a mistake.
[03:41:11.879 --> 03:41:12.600]  It's not a typo.
[03:41:13.141 --> 03:41:27.498]  It's because livestock, when they're handled in a more free-range way or a more sustainable way, actually are very, very efficient converters of land and sunlight energy through plants into food supply for humans.
[03:41:28.039 --> 03:41:29.661]  Cattle are sustainable.
[03:41:30.470 --> 03:41:42.858]  And yet these toxic agricultural practices that are spraying glyphosate and spraying atrazine all over the vegetable crops and destroying the soils and causing massive erosion, those are not sustainable.
[03:41:43.319 --> 03:41:45.000]  Cory Booker is exactly wrong.
[03:41:45.660 --> 03:41:58.969]  It's the vegetable farming, the crop farming in America that is poisoning the soils, destroying the microbes, eroding the soils, while it's actually the cattle operations, the free-range ones, that don't erode the soil.
[03:41:59.713 --> 03:42:03.614]  That actually are sustainable and that require very, very few inputs to produce food.
[03:42:04.074 --> 03:42:09.036]  So you see, once again, these people, these Democrats, have no understanding of agriculture.
[03:42:09.436 --> 03:42:10.936]  They don't know how anything works.
[03:42:11.216 --> 03:42:12.337]  They don't understand history.
[03:42:12.657 --> 03:42:13.717]  They don't understand science.
[03:42:13.757 --> 03:42:15.298]  They don't understand energy density.
[03:42:15.598 --> 03:42:18.799]  They think you can put batteries in everything and power the world with batteries.
[03:42:19.219 --> 03:42:22.320]  Well, there's no battery-powered tractors that you can use to produce food.
[03:42:22.340 --> 03:42:25.561]  I mean, there are toy tractors for your children to ride.
[03:42:25.881 --> 03:42:26.421]  They're toys!
[03:42:27.136 --> 03:42:29.117]  They don't produce the food supply for America.
[03:42:29.317 --> 03:42:33.038]  Diesel engines produce the food supply for America.
[03:42:33.058 --> 03:42:35.659]  And if you don't understand that, you know, I'm sorry, but you need to get educated.
[03:42:36.900 --> 03:42:41.081]  So, once again, we need a basic IQ test for members of Congress.
[03:42:41.942 --> 03:42:52.506]  It's the lack of intelligence, how we get people like Cory Booker or Ocasio-Cortez or others who are just... I'm sorry, but they're completely illiterate when it comes to reality.
[03:42:52.526 --> 03:42:53.466]  They live in dream worlds.
[03:42:54.486 --> 03:42:55.767]  We'll have more straight ahead.
[03:42:55.787 --> 03:42:57.208]  Stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:57.228 --> 03:42:58.029]  This is Mike Adams.
[03:42:58.349 --> 03:42:58.910]  We'll be right back.
[03:43:02.673 --> 03:43:10.039]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[03:43:10.659 --> 03:43:16.464]  And a lot of times we reach out to top companies, and they don't want to private label to us because, well, we're InfoWars and we've been demonized.
[03:43:16.524 --> 03:43:20.828]  But a lot of times, people will work with us only because we're InfoWars.
[03:43:21.408 --> 03:43:36.999]  Well, there is a national company, and I'm not going to name them because we're not in competition with them, but we probably have a product, who has FDA approval for years to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there until you get to prescription level of wound gel that can be sold in stores.
[03:43:37.659 --> 03:43:44.524]  And we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[03:43:45.125 --> 03:43:46.746]  But the announcement here today is this.
[03:43:47.447 --> 03:43:50.929]  We've been selling a lot of the Womb Shell and a lot of the Immune Garden.
[03:43:51.370 --> 03:43:53.652]  In fact, we just put in big orders for both of them.
[03:43:54.412 --> 03:44:05.155]  But then I noticed without us even plugging it, because of all the scary stuff going on this winter with viruses and bacteria spreading at record levels, that it was all flying off the shelves at regular price.
[03:44:05.835 --> 03:44:12.917]  And so unlike other companies and other groups that do things like raise prices during a crisis, we're going to go from
[03:44:13.337 --> 03:44:20.780]  Full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:44:21.220 --> 03:44:22.100]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:44:22.460 --> 03:44:26.382]  We're going to go to 40% off because I just put a big order in.
[03:44:26.682 --> 03:44:32.324]  It'll be a few months till more comes in, but I want you to have the impetus and the initiative to get it for yourself and your family.
[03:44:33.104 --> 03:44:36.466]  Get a great discount, see how great it works, and become a repeat customer.
[03:44:36.707 --> 03:44:41.410]  It's just as a Texan, and as American, and as a patriot, that's how I want to be treated.
[03:44:41.910 --> 03:44:49.175]  That when there's a crisis, and people really need something and want it, I'm gonna sell it at a huge discount instead of selling it at full price because I noticed you were buying it.
[03:44:49.536 --> 03:45:00.063]  So because you're supporting us and already buying it, both the products, 40% off as a combo, or 40% off individually, all supplies last, at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:45:05.035 --> 03:45:08.460]  I cannot say enough nice things about Super Male Vitality right here.
[03:45:08.760 --> 03:45:10.122]  I actually have three of them on my desk.
[03:45:10.142 --> 03:45:10.983]  This is my favorite.
[03:45:11.003 --> 03:45:13.546]  It's heartbreaking that it's going away, I really think.
[03:45:13.927 --> 03:45:14.848]  I mean, really, it's true.
[03:45:14.888 --> 03:45:17.932]  Ever since I've tried these two here, I've also got another one sitting here.
[03:45:18.092 --> 03:45:20.034]  Alpha Power, Super Male Vitality.
[03:45:20.134 --> 03:45:22.958]  They have given me the energy that I did not have.
[03:45:23.158 --> 03:45:27.059]  I mean, my God, I didn't realize how little I was doing before with these two here.
[03:45:27.399 --> 03:45:31.640]  I have the energy to go to the gym at the end of a long day of working at the end of doing a broadcast.
[03:45:31.740 --> 03:45:33.000]  I have the energy to go to a gym.
[03:45:33.081 --> 03:45:36.581]  And frankly, I really think this is better than anything you're going to get in the store.
[03:45:36.621 --> 03:45:37.402]  It's heartbreaking.
[03:45:37.442 --> 03:45:39.662]  The super male vitality is about to go away.
[03:45:39.702 --> 03:45:43.063]  And again, it's just because you can't find the herbs and you don't want to sell us crap.
[03:45:43.063 --> 03:45:44.344]  Yeah, but that's what it's all about.
[03:45:44.364 --> 03:45:45.566]  This is the real deal.
[03:45:45.606 --> 03:45:49.310]  You take two droplets of this a couple times a day, and all of a sudden it's like, whoa!
[03:45:49.510 --> 03:45:50.331]  I'm a man again!
[03:45:50.591 --> 03:45:55.737]  I have all the power that a steady diet of soy fed through government schools robbed me of.
[03:45:55.797 --> 03:45:56.418]  It's back!
[03:45:56.798 --> 03:45:59.461]  So between that, I've got my X2 right here.
[03:45:59.581 --> 03:46:03.606]  Everything else I've tried, I have a filter in my house, a water filter I just bought.
[03:46:03.646 --> 03:46:06.809]  For my family, everybody loves everything in the InfoWars store.
[03:46:06.929 --> 03:46:08.550]  Everything is very reasonably priced.
[03:46:08.670 --> 03:46:09.751]  You're supporting the show.
[03:46:09.791 --> 03:46:11.072]  You're supporting the InfoWars.
[03:46:11.152 --> 03:46:14.274]  And really, as conservatives, who are you going to give your money to?
[03:46:14.354 --> 03:46:19.699]  Are you going to go to the supplement store and give it to somebody who probably advertises on Roku?
[03:46:19.819 --> 03:46:22.341]  Or are you going to give your money directly to Alex Jones?
[03:46:22.381 --> 03:46:23.662]  It's an easy choice, I think.
[03:46:23.722 --> 03:46:25.323]  These are exciting times we live in.
[03:46:25.463 --> 03:46:29.486]  And yes, super male vitality or female vitality is an aging process.
[03:46:29.547 --> 03:46:30.207]  It's cold pressed.
[03:46:30.307 --> 03:46:31.328]  It takes three to four times
[03:46:31.428 --> 03:46:35.749]  More of the herbs to do it, and it's super, super strong for libido, stamina, energy.
[03:46:35.829 --> 03:46:41.650]  When I first heard about it, like six, seven years ago, that was being developed, and I actually tried it, I was like, okay, this is actually works.
[03:46:41.790 --> 03:46:45.891]  But I mean, I lost 60, 70 pounds with the X2 and with the SuperMetal Vitality.
[03:46:45.991 --> 03:46:48.032]  I've gained a few pounds back because I barely work out anymore.
[03:46:48.152 --> 03:46:54.313]  And if I wasn't taking it and wasn't taking the X2 and X3, I would definitely be pushing 300 pounds right now.
[03:46:54.573 --> 03:46:59.395]  So get your SuperMetal Vitality, the final run, unless me squeezing them makes it way down on the price.
[03:46:59.495 --> 03:47:00.695]  So get it today while you still can.
[03:47:06.219 --> 03:47:10.302]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.465 --> 03:47:16.186]  Big Brother.
[03:47:16.626 --> 03:47:17.827]  Mainstream media.
[03:47:18.507 --> 03:47:19.648]  Government cover-ups.
[03:47:20.168 --> 03:47:21.109]  You want answers?
[03:47:21.669 --> 03:47:22.770]  Well, so does he.
[03:47:23.371 --> 03:47:25.212]  It's Mike Adams!
[03:47:26.132 --> 03:47:26.833]  Check it!
[03:47:27.814 --> 03:47:32.496]  All right, Mike Adams back again here today on the Alex Jones Show, last segment for the day.
[03:47:32.536 --> 03:47:33.436]  Thank you for joining me.
[03:47:33.456 --> 03:47:38.658]  I'm going to break down Apple's censorship attack on natural news today.
[03:47:39.299 --> 03:47:42.140]  Alex was right when he said that InfoWars was the test case.
[03:47:42.560 --> 03:47:50.283]  So when InfoWars was being deplatformed by everybody, really I think these tech companies were trying to see, can they get away with it?
[03:47:50.583 --> 03:47:56.105]  Would there be any pushback from the President or the FTC or the DOJ or members of Congress?
[03:47:56.126 --> 03:47:57.026]  Would there be any pushback?
[03:47:57.566 --> 03:48:08.175]  And so, of course, they created this narrative to first discredit Alex Jones and then censor him by justifying that censorship by saying essentially, oh, look, he's a bad person.
[03:48:08.215 --> 03:48:09.176]  He said this and this and this.
[03:48:09.676 --> 03:48:13.539]  Of course, they were dishonest in their attacks, but this is their pattern.
[03:48:13.559 --> 03:48:14.120]  This is what they do.
[03:48:14.220 --> 03:48:18.744]  First, they lie and smear and discredit, and then they censor.
[03:48:19.324 --> 03:48:24.829]  But they've been accelerating that game now to the point where inside companies like Apple and Twitter,
[03:48:25.444 --> 03:48:28.726]  They don't even, they just skip the discrediting step now.
[03:48:28.766 --> 03:48:30.808]  They just ban you for any reason.
[03:48:31.448 --> 03:48:35.871]  And as Apple has done to us now, Natural News, they started sending us demand emails.
[03:48:36.051 --> 03:48:41.935]  Apple demanding that we stop publishing articles on abortion or Satanism.
[03:48:42.155 --> 03:48:51.061]  You know, exposing the evils of Satanism and how it's become, it has invaded the psyche of many people in America, especially leftists.
[03:48:51.941 --> 03:48:52.482]  They said that
[03:48:53.712 --> 03:48:55.854]  We have to stop publishing articles about censorship.
[03:48:56.474 --> 03:49:03.419]  So literally, Apple is sending us a censorship demand letter demanding that we stop writing about censorship.
[03:49:04.140 --> 03:49:09.944]  I mean, think about the levels of Orwellian evil found in that nested loop.
[03:49:10.304 --> 03:49:10.905]  It's insane.
[03:49:11.245 --> 03:49:13.687]  They said we can't write about Infowars being censored.
[03:49:14.047 --> 03:49:19.491]  They said we can't write about migrants carrying infectious disease into the United States.
[03:49:19.511 --> 03:49:20.952]  I mean, just think about this.
[03:49:21.804 --> 03:49:26.986]  NaturalNews.com, you know, we're primarily a health site, but a health freedom pro-liberty site as well.
[03:49:28.227 --> 03:49:32.209]  It is our duty to talk about infectious disease being brought into America.
[03:49:32.609 --> 03:49:38.972]  It's our duty to talk about drug-resistant tuberculosis carried by illegal immigrants across the border.
[03:49:39.592 --> 03:49:48.916]  It's our duty to talk about the fact that most of the measles outbreaks in America happen among children who have already been vaccinated with the MMR vaccine.
[03:49:49.850 --> 03:49:50.611]  This is our duty.
[03:49:51.091 --> 03:49:58.317]  And Apple says, no, we demand that you do not talk about these topics or we will ban your app.
[03:49:59.457 --> 03:50:00.658]  Just like they did to Infowars.
[03:50:01.599 --> 03:50:04.241]  But the reason that they're giving is nonsense.
[03:50:04.561 --> 03:50:07.704]  They say that our articles might create a reaction of disgust.
[03:50:08.470 --> 03:50:09.651]  In the minds of somebody.
[03:50:09.751 --> 03:50:10.311]  Well, who?
[03:50:10.531 --> 03:50:14.654]  Well, apparently the incredible liberal cry-bullies who work at Apple.
[03:50:14.974 --> 03:50:16.195]  That's who's offended by these.
[03:50:16.255 --> 03:50:20.238]  That's who feels disgusted by it because, of course, these people are all Satanists.
[03:50:20.718 --> 03:50:21.979]  These people are all abortionists.
[03:50:22.399 --> 03:50:29.664]  These people are the people who want to poison your water supply because they are opposed to water filters now because InfoWars sells water filters.
[03:50:30.065 --> 03:50:31.506]  So, think about this.
[03:50:31.626 --> 03:50:33.227]  This demonic left
[03:50:34.022 --> 03:50:39.764]  They are opposed to life and health and clean water and nutrition.
[03:50:40.484 --> 03:50:42.405]  They are all pro-pharma.
[03:50:42.725 --> 03:50:45.326]  They want to drug your children with psychiatric drugs.
[03:50:45.986 --> 03:50:49.347]  And that's if your children survive the abortion mass murder attempt, of course.
[03:50:49.648 --> 03:50:51.468]  So they want to murder your children.
[03:50:52.549 --> 03:50:56.810]  But if you change your mind and don't want to murder them, they want to drug your children into oblivion.
[03:50:57.110 --> 03:50:59.271]  Then they want to poison you through all adulthood.
[03:51:00.069 --> 03:51:06.213]  Apple is all pro-chemotherapy, toxic chemical weapons that cause utter destruction across the human body.
[03:51:06.493 --> 03:51:09.235]  Heart damage, brain damage, kidney damage, liver damage.
[03:51:10.015 --> 03:51:13.037]  Chemotherapy causes cancer to come back stronger than ever.
[03:51:13.417 --> 03:51:15.098]  Apple is pro-chemotherapy!
[03:51:16.099 --> 03:51:25.405]  I mean, is there any destructive poison or destructive propaganda or destructive violent practice that Apple opposes?
[03:51:26.414 --> 03:51:31.638]  Apple seems to be interested in just mass destruction, death, and human suffering.
[03:51:32.059 --> 03:51:36.803]  And that's why they are offended by my articles, which say, wait a minute, let's protect life here.
[03:51:37.323 --> 03:51:41.907]  Let's do something amazing and not murder children after they're born.
[03:51:42.407 --> 03:51:47.732]  How about we don't drug our children so that they turn into suicidal school shooters
[03:51:48.232 --> 03:51:50.453]  You know, hopped up on antidepressants.
[03:51:50.893 --> 03:51:52.713]  How about we have clean water?
[03:51:53.013 --> 03:52:00.655]  How about we use nutrition to prevent and reverse cancer, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, dementia?
[03:52:00.695 --> 03:52:09.497]  Why don't we turn to high-powered nutritional supplements to support and enhance cognitive function without using toxic pharmaceutical medications?
[03:52:10.077 --> 03:52:11.638]  These are the ideas that I stand for.
[03:52:11.958 --> 03:52:13.578]  And also, health freedom.
[03:52:14.358 --> 03:52:15.378]  You know, health freedom.
[03:52:15.398 --> 03:52:17.519]  Your right to say no to vaccines.
[03:52:18.382 --> 03:52:21.185]  You know, you're right to choose natural medicine.
[03:52:21.685 --> 03:52:28.511]  You're right to say no to your doctor, no to a pharmaceutical, and instead use a natural method to protect and enhance your health.
[03:52:28.771 --> 03:52:33.375]  But these ideas are offensive to Apple and apparently offensive to Tim Cook.
[03:52:34.116 --> 03:52:37.739]  Makes me wonder what kind of philosophy Tim Cook actually has as the leader of Apple.
[03:52:38.280 --> 03:52:43.104]  Surely he's aware that Apple is demanding natural news be censored.
[03:52:43.925 --> 03:52:45.326]  What does Tim Cook believe in?
[03:52:46.320 --> 03:52:52.081]  If he doesn't believe in protecting life and natural health and preventing disease and ending human suffering, what does he believe in?
[03:52:53.361 --> 03:53:14.666]  Well, it wouldn't be hard to assume that, at least if his staff is following his direction here, that maybe he believes in allowing Satan to rule over the earth, that he believes in silencing voices of truth and reason, that he believes in spreading evil through Apple, through all Apple devices that people carry in their hands, like Mark of the Beast items,
[03:53:15.402 --> 03:53:29.613]  An evil, fake news, deception, propaganda screen, run by Apple, ruled by evil, controlled by those who want to murder their own children and would think nothing about murdering yours.
[03:53:30.474 --> 03:53:31.454]  That's what Apple has become.
[03:53:32.635 --> 03:53:33.256]  It's very sad.
[03:53:33.896 --> 03:53:41.242]  It's very sad that we live in a world like this, where evil has now taken over Google, Apple, Twitter,
[03:53:41.917 --> 03:53:46.980]  YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat, all of it, now consumed by evil.
[03:53:47.620 --> 03:53:59.748]  It's extraordinary, and if you're looking for answers to this, you know, I've mentioned this before, but you need, number one, you need to pray for protection.
[03:54:00.949 --> 03:54:11.475]  We literally need to pray for protection, and we need to double down on our own good morality, our own philosophy of protecting children, our philosophy of
[03:54:12.270 --> 03:54:21.232]  Printing the truth, our philosophy of protecting access to natural medicine that, let's face it, has been on this planet for as long as human beings have been alive.
[03:54:22.153 --> 03:54:33.736]  It's no coincidence that hemp, for example, grows like a weed everywhere and happens to be biocompatible with the human body, the endocannabinoid system.
[03:54:34.455 --> 03:55:02.599]  is designed into the human body the genetic blueprint designed for humans by an intelligent designer by the way that blueprint is compatible with cannabis it's irrefutable it's there are endocannabinoid receptors on many many organs throughout our body and in fact if you consume omega-3 fatty acids your body creates a trace amount of cannabinoids right in your own body you make medicine
[03:55:03.243 --> 03:55:06.964]  Inside your body when you consume omega-3s, which come from fish oils, by the way.
[03:55:07.284 --> 03:55:22.149]  You make your own medicine and yet evil Apple, evil Google, evil YouTube wants to ban any talk about this natural medicine, nutritional supplements, protecting life, the divinity of and the blessing of our life.
[03:55:23.471 --> 03:55:31.338]  All of our lives and our children being born alive as divine beings, conscious beings to help create a brighter future for humanity.
[03:55:31.818 --> 03:55:33.260]  Apple is opposed to all of that.
[03:55:33.740 --> 03:55:38.905]  Apple is infused with intense Satanism and evil, destruction and darkness.
[03:55:39.406 --> 03:55:43.089]  And they are cutting off the most important voices of our time.
[03:55:43.510 --> 03:55:47.954]  The voices that can bring you truth and inspiration, healing,
[03:55:48.894 --> 03:55:54.877]  Those voices are the independent media, and that's who's being shut off because evil is taking over the tech giants.
[03:55:55.517 --> 03:55:56.238]  It's disgusting.
[03:55:57.578 --> 03:55:58.159]  You know, it's funny.
[03:55:58.359 --> 03:56:03.701]  They censor us and say that our articles create disgust, and yet their own actions at Apple are disgusting.
[03:56:04.382 --> 03:56:04.842]  They are not.
[03:56:05.002 --> 03:56:07.303]  I mean, they are disgusting people.
[03:56:08.140 --> 03:56:09.120]  Who run that show.
[03:56:10.281 --> 03:56:14.083]  In some ways, I don't even consider them to be human because they've lost all human compassion.
[03:56:14.503 --> 03:56:15.763]  They don't even care about their own babies.
[03:56:15.803 --> 03:56:19.945]  They would stand by and literally support the serial murder of their own children.
[03:56:20.485 --> 03:56:22.906]  That's who they have become and that's what we are up against, folks.
[03:56:23.527 --> 03:56:24.587]  So I just want to encourage you.
[03:56:25.408 --> 03:56:30.590]  Number one, I thank you for your support for InfoWars, for Natural News, for all of us in the independent media.
[03:56:31.170 --> 03:56:33.091]  Your support is crucial in this time.
[03:56:33.894 --> 03:56:36.515]  The economic sabotage has been intense.
[03:56:36.875 --> 03:56:40.657]  The censorship continues to be ramped up against us all.
[03:56:41.277 --> 03:56:49.781]  And yet, somehow I feel like we will be victorious in this, because the light always wins, truth always wins out, and God is literally on our side.
[03:56:49.801 --> 03:56:52.642]  Because we are fighting to protect babies.
[03:56:53.062 --> 03:56:54.303]  We are fighting to protect life.
[03:56:54.343 --> 03:56:56.904]  We're fighting to protect our ecosystem, our planet.
[03:56:57.324 --> 03:56:59.725]  And we need your support in order to do that.
[03:57:00.965 --> 03:57:02.086]  So just to wrap this up today,
[03:57:03.183 --> 03:57:04.084]  Support the InfoWars.
[03:57:05.285 --> 03:57:13.533]  You know, they work hard to put out so many incredible products and many of them I've tested in my lab and I keep meaning to tell Alex I'm going to come in.
[03:57:13.553 --> 03:57:17.816]  I've got glyphosate certification testing for some of InfoWars top products.
[03:57:17.836 --> 03:57:22.681]  I need to come in and actually just hand over the report because we've done the glyphosate testing on those and it's all clean.
[03:57:23.311 --> 03:57:25.952]  You know, but we're so busy, we don't even have time.
[03:57:26.532 --> 03:57:29.333]  I rarely even talk to Alex, except here on the show, by the way.
[03:57:29.373 --> 03:57:32.214]  But support our efforts, and we will fight for you.
[03:57:32.714 --> 03:57:33.634]  We will fight for life.
[03:57:34.495 --> 03:57:35.855]  We will fight for divinity.
[03:57:36.475 --> 03:57:41.317]  We will fight for truth and freedom and liberty in every way possible.
[03:57:41.377 --> 03:57:42.957]  We are 100% committed to it.
[03:57:43.797 --> 03:57:44.998]  And they're not going to shut us down.
[03:57:45.678 --> 03:57:49.219]  No matter what they try, we are here to fight for you and fight for the future of humanity.
[03:57:49.639 --> 03:57:50.460]  Thanks for watching today.
[03:57:50.480 --> 03:57:51.220]  This is Mike Adams.
[03:57:51.260 --> 03:57:51.580]  Take care.
[03:58:02.619 --> 03:58:09.885]  We are offering our best-selling product, BrainForce+, the amazing nootropic for focus, energy, intelligence, you name it.
[03:58:09.905 --> 03:58:10.626]  It's just amazing.
[03:58:11.387 --> 03:58:12.167]  It's 50% off.
[03:58:12.207 --> 03:58:13.508]  That is a massive discount.
[03:58:13.528 --> 03:58:18.733]  But I've got to stop this sale, even though it's been very successful, because we're running low on BrainForce+.
[03:58:18.913 --> 03:58:19.313]  Now it's 50% off.
[03:58:20.034 --> 03:58:23.098]  Coupled in a combo with TurboForce at 33% off.
[03:58:23.279 --> 03:58:25.522]  So the two together are a massive savings.
[03:58:25.662 --> 03:58:28.025]  Now BrainForce is a nootropic for the brain.
[03:58:28.246 --> 03:58:32.411]  And leading competitors are 2-3 times more with similar ingredients.
[03:58:32.472 --> 03:58:35.716]  This is the best ingredients out there at the lowest price.
[03:58:36.497 --> 03:58:38.278]  You couple it with TurboForce.
[03:58:38.538 --> 03:58:39.618]  I don't even know what to call it.
[03:58:39.698 --> 03:58:40.598]  Is it a pre-workout?
[03:58:40.698 --> 03:58:41.839]  Is it long-lasting energy?
[03:58:41.859 --> 03:58:42.999]  Is it next-level energy drink?
[03:58:43.039 --> 03:58:43.719]  That's what it all is.
[03:58:43.879 --> 03:58:45.640]  It's healthy, long-lasting energy.
[03:58:45.780 --> 03:58:52.202]  Clean-burning, with all the different types of naturally occurring energy, with the amino acids, with the vitamins, the minerals, and so much more.
[03:58:52.242 --> 03:58:53.822]  It's TurboForce, comes in packets.
[03:58:54.082 --> 03:58:57.583]  I suggest you only take half a packet the first time you take it.
[03:58:57.703 --> 03:58:59.564]  And if you take it with BrainForce, they go together great.
