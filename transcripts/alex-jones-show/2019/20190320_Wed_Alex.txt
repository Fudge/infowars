[00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:19.607]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:00:20.268 --> 00:00:22.531]  Run on for a long time.
[00:00:23.253 --> 00:00:25.356]  Run on for a long time.
[00:00:26.057 --> 00:00:28.501]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.505]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:39.623]  You know, there's a big story up on Infowars.com, and it's a national news story.
[00:00:39.663 --> 00:00:43.784]  Ted Koppel said the sky's blue and the bananas, when they're ripe, are yellow.
[00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:16.627]  He came out at the Carnegie Endowment, that's the top of the whole globalist pyramid, of the tax-free foundations, and he said, you know, the Washington Post and the New York Times are unified in their propaganda against Trump, and it's very, very dangerous.
[00:01:18.988 --> 00:01:23.130]  But why do we need Ted Koppel to tell us that?
[00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:27.652]  I mean, I've been saying for years, I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[00:01:28.232 --> 00:01:30.573]  I've never sent anybody to the Sandy Hook family's houses.
[00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:38.552]  But they went on NPR this weekend and said that I was currently doing it and so that's why I need to be taken off the air.
[00:01:41.114 --> 00:01:45.639]  Which I can tell you really upset some law firms in Washington DC who don't even represent me.
[00:01:47.681 --> 00:01:51.605]  But who are beginning to understand what's happening in the organized plan to take down the First Amendment.
[00:01:53.247 --> 00:01:55.389]  This country and this world is in the grip
[00:01:57.188 --> 00:01:58.509]  of the end of free speech.
[00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.530]  Russia's passing draconian anti-free speech laws.
[00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.011]  Japan, China are moving forward.
[00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:07.312]  China obviously already deep in the grips of it.
[00:02:07.692 --> 00:02:09.652]  The EU is engaged in massive censorship.
[00:02:10.053 --> 00:02:15.455]  And when the EU criticized Putin, he said, hey, you're doing stuff more draconian than I am.
[00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:19.136]  It's out of control.
[00:02:19.776 --> 00:02:22.017]  They are arresting people in England,
[00:02:23.388 --> 00:02:27.330]  And in Sweden, and in states like California and the U.S.
[00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.310]  for using the wrong pronoun.
[00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:38.054]  You have a right, if somebody looks like a man and you say, hey man, to say that.
[00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:39.314]  You have a right to say.
[00:02:41.996 --> 00:02:43.116]  The moon is made of cheese.
[00:02:43.156 --> 00:02:44.937]  You have the right to say.
[00:02:46.177 --> 00:02:47.538]  The deep blue sea is blue.
[00:02:48.746 --> 00:02:49.687]  You have a right to be right.
[00:02:50.268 --> 00:02:51.229]  You have a right to be wrong.
[00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:54.592]  And I know I'm stating incredibly obvious things here.
[00:02:56.174 --> 00:02:59.517]  But the left is a cult of control freaks.
[00:02:59.537 --> 00:03:01.339]  Here's one of the articles, newswars.com.
[00:03:02.461 --> 00:03:09.468]  Catholic journalist criminally investigated for using the wrong pronoun in a tweet.
[00:03:13.635 --> 00:03:16.637]  And then you get big old giant bullies, big old men.
[00:03:16.657 --> 00:03:19.719]  You can only tell they think they're a woman because they're wearing a pink shirt.
[00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:24.822]  Come in and they say, okay guys, come on, we're ready for you at the cash register.
[00:03:25.342 --> 00:03:27.463]  Excuse me, it's ma'am!
[00:03:30.685 --> 00:03:38.010]  And you know the globalist master plan when you
[00:03:40.282 --> 00:03:46.368]  See what they protect and what they're obsessed with, and it's ending the family, ending the sexes, and ending language.
[00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:53.514]  Here's a clip of Ted Koppel stating that, again, the ocean is wet.
[00:03:53.674 --> 00:03:53.995]  Here it is.
[00:03:55.968 --> 00:04:07.819]  I'm terribly concerned that when you talk about the New York Times these days, when you talk about the Washington Post these days, we're not talking about the New York Times of 50 years ago.
[00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:11.882]  We are not talking about the Washington Post of 50 years ago.
[00:04:12.963 --> 00:04:22.612]  We're talking about organizations that I believe have, in fact, decided, as organizations,
[00:04:23.444 --> 00:04:26.406]  That Donald J. Trump is bad for the United States.
[00:04:28.407 --> 00:04:36.013]  We have things appearing on the front page of the New York Times right now that never would have appeared 50 years ago.
[00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:37.894]  Analysis.
[00:04:38.935 --> 00:04:39.695]  Commentary.
[00:04:40.496 --> 00:04:41.676]  On the front page.
[00:04:42.577 --> 00:04:46.440]  I remember sitting at the breakfast table with my wife during the campaign
[00:04:47.575 --> 00:04:50.756]  After the Access Hollywood tape came out.
[00:04:51.576 --> 00:04:53.037]  We've got more of this coming up.
[00:04:53.097 --> 00:04:54.818]  Big show lined up today.
[00:04:55.238 --> 00:04:56.538]  Whatever you do, spread the live links.
[00:04:56.558 --> 00:04:59.679]  Tell folks at the local stations, that's how you defeat the census.
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.841]  That's how we continue to march forward.
[00:05:05.723 --> 00:05:15.151]  We're going to do, this Thursday through Friday through Saturday, a 50-hour emergency Save the First Amendment broadcast with a bunch of special guests and a bunch of stuff we've never done before.
[00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:16.412]  Believe me, this is going to be special.
[00:05:16.532 --> 00:05:17.373]  Thursday 8 a.m.
[00:05:17.393 --> 00:05:20.976]  with David Knight, right through Saturday 10 a.m., 50 hours, a bunch of special guests.
[00:05:21.096 --> 00:05:27.042]  We're going to blur out the violence, but we're going to look at all the anomalies, not even saying there's anomalies.
[00:05:27.262 --> 00:05:28.463]  We have a right to.
[00:05:28.803 --> 00:05:29.363]  Bill Johnson?
[00:05:29.523 --> 00:05:30.864]  No, I completely agree with you.
[00:05:31.204 --> 00:05:34.626]  And it should be done, because the liberal media, they're not going to show any of that.
[00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:35.807]  They're not going to talk about that.
[00:05:35.947 --> 00:05:39.729]  They want to push this narrative again, that it's white supremacy.
[00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.612]  And even when you read through all the information, he doesn't look like he's a white supremacy.
[00:05:44.672 --> 00:05:46.554]  He's completely for the Green Deal.
[00:05:46.634 --> 00:05:52.177]  He's against President Trump, but yet you have the media, even Fox News, pushing that he's a white supremacist.
[00:05:52.237 --> 00:05:52.497]  Why?
[00:05:52.637 --> 00:05:55.539]  Because all racist roads lead to white people.
[00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:57.019]  I mean, it's sickening.
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.061]  The truth is governments do do stuff like this, and it's legitimate for anybody to ask those type of questions.
[00:06:10.964 --> 00:06:11.704]  Big Brother.
[00:06:13.085 --> 00:06:14.305]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:15.866 --> 00:06:16.946]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:18.442 --> 00:06:19.423]  You want answers?
[00:06:20.344 --> 00:06:21.985]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:22.306 --> 00:06:28.611]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:33.856 --> 00:06:37.819]  I've been watching and I've been waiting.
[00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:38.840]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:06:41.202 --> 00:06:42.744]  We're here live Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:06:42.764 --> 00:06:42.944]  11 a.m.
[00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:47.720]  At 3 p.m.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.982]  Central, the War Room with Owen Schroyer, 3 o'clock Central.
[00:06:52.283 --> 00:06:54.485]  Roger Stone can't co-host, he's got a gag order.
[00:06:55.426 --> 00:06:57.928]  Can't even write books, right here in the USA!
[00:06:57.948 --> 00:06:59.410]  Keep your mouth shut!
[00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.852]  And, of course, we've got David Knight.
[00:07:01.932 --> 00:07:03.653]  He's not been locked up or gagged yet.
[00:07:05.615 --> 00:07:05.975]  8 a.m.
[00:07:06.015 --> 00:07:07.697]  Central, but guess what happens tomorrow?
[00:07:08.735 --> 00:07:31.448]  We've got a Stop the Bias, hashtag Stop the Bias, Stop Big Tech Censorship, Save the First Amendment live global 50-hour broadcast where we have got a flotilla of top guest experts on with the main focus on the censorship and how to counter the globalists and what needs to be done.
[00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:36.531]  We need Section 230 to be stripped from Big Tech.
[00:07:36.691 --> 00:07:37.752]  Nobody else has immunity.
[00:07:39.784 --> 00:07:48.186]  If they want to act as publishers and censor and control, and say they have editorial control like Tim Cook has said, then you lose $2.30.
[00:07:49.787 --> 00:07:50.987]  Which, by the way, I don't want to do.
[00:07:52.628 --> 00:07:55.589]  But, you can't have your filthy cake and eat it too.
[00:07:57.609 --> 00:07:59.550]  So we've got just amazing guests.
[00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.131]  Everybody from Tommy Robinson to you, name it, will be joining us.
[00:08:06.426 --> 00:08:19.188]  And Trump, since we've been lighting a fire under his tail, has been saying, OK, I won't wait until the campaign, until I get back into office with a campaign pledge to go after Big Tech with antitrust suits.
[00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:20.568]  I'll do it now.
[00:08:20.889 --> 00:08:21.209]  Good.
[00:08:21.289 --> 00:08:27.250]  Let's keep lighting more fires under the president's luteus maximus.
[00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.070]  Because squeaky wheels get to grace here and this has got to be done.
[00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.451]  And there's a lot going on behind the scenes as
[00:08:35.987 --> 00:08:41.111]  Corporate America actually wakes up and says, wait, they're actually going to end the First Amendment and New York Times versus Sullivan?
[00:08:41.471 --> 00:08:42.151]  What does that mean?
[00:08:43.352 --> 00:08:50.597]  And so before, a large part of corporate America was globalist and wanted this, but now a large part is waking up and saying, you're really going to do that?
[00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:57.442]  So a lot of big stuff going on behind the scenes that I'm not at liberty to tell you, and that I will never tell you, because it's off record.
[00:08:58.583 --> 00:09:04.107]  But I've been talking to folks in California, people in Silicon Valley, people who have national talk shows.
[00:09:05.026 --> 00:09:06.526]  And I've been talking to a lot of other people.
[00:09:08.867 --> 00:09:13.488]  And to the level of having to sign non-disclosures and things, which I will not violate.
[00:09:14.869 --> 00:09:17.469]  And there is a lot going on.
[00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.090]  A lot going on.
[00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.051]  And there's a big buzz going.
[00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:26.732]  I got two calls this weekend from big national hosts.
[00:09:26.772 --> 00:09:28.492]  We're going to go to Mark Dice's report first.
[00:09:31.724 --> 00:09:32.724]  I was going to play one report.
[00:09:33.325 --> 00:09:34.705]  Mikey, I was going to play that next segment.
[00:09:35.245 --> 00:09:39.066]  I'm going to play Mark Dice's report first.
[00:09:41.227 --> 00:09:52.911]  And I got these calls and they said, wow, you know, at very high levels in Silicon Valley and in Hollywood, they're finally concerned about you being censored and realize it's going to be everybody.
[00:09:55.049 --> 00:09:55.149]  And
[00:10:10.709 --> 00:10:14.372]  Agreed to do it, and then doubled back and didn't stop.
[00:10:15.092 --> 00:10:18.374]  So, this civil war in the government is not just between left and right.
[00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:27.681]  It is between people that want to have any semblance of due process, and any semblance of rule of law, and this authoritarian instinct that we're going headlong into.
[00:10:27.701 --> 00:10:30.183]  That, by the way, planetary.
[00:10:31.003 --> 00:10:36.107]  Without even looking for it, half my stack, probably 50 stories or more,
[00:10:37.208 --> 00:10:44.054]  are about governments and corporations and universities all over the world just saying there's no more free speech.
[00:10:44.114 --> 00:10:44.595]  It's gone.
[00:10:47.037 --> 00:10:50.180]  Here's Mark Dice breaking some of the latest attacks down.
[00:10:51.641 --> 00:10:58.108]  First they came for Alex Jones and a lot of people thought he said some crazy things and he's kind of on the fringe.
[00:10:58.489 --> 00:11:01.853]  They certainly won't censor any mainstream conservatives.
[00:11:02.113 --> 00:11:05.116]  Well I've been trying to tell you that he was just the beginning.
[00:11:05.216 --> 00:11:09.842]  YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki recently sat down for an interview with Kara Swisher
[00:11:10.322 --> 00:11:13.923]  If you're not familiar with her name, I'm sure that you've seen some of her interviews.
[00:11:14.324 --> 00:11:21.406]  She was the one who did that interview with Mark Zuckerberg when he was sweating profusely when she brought up some of the privacy concerns.
[00:11:21.566 --> 00:11:28.429]  She also scored that historic interview with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and has interviewed all of the big names in tech.
[00:11:28.809 --> 00:11:43.674]  And at this year's Lesbians Who Tech conference in San Francisco, Kara Swisher pressured YouTube's CEO to ban Ben Shapiro, a conservative commentator perhaps best known for giving lectures on college campuses.
[00:11:43.874 --> 00:11:58.782]  Kara Swisher, who, as you may have guessed, is a lesbian, hence her being at the Lesbian Sue Tech Conference, adopted a poor child, along with her wife, who is now 13 years old, and is watching Ben Shapiro videos on YouTube.
[00:11:59.002 --> 00:12:00.123]  I'll get to recommendations.
[00:12:00.183 --> 00:12:02.244]  I have a personal beef with you about that.
[00:12:02.544 --> 00:12:02.845]  Okay.
[00:12:03.665 --> 00:12:04.726]  I can't wait to hear.
[00:12:05.606 --> 00:12:10.450]  My son, who's 13 years old, started watching Ben Shapiro videos.
[00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.592]  And he's like the gateway drug to the next group.
[00:12:13.632 --> 00:12:15.053]  And then it goes right to Jordan Peterson.
[00:12:15.073 --> 00:12:15.853]  And then it goes down.
[00:12:15.893 --> 00:12:17.995]  And in three clicks, he was at neo-Nazi stuff.
[00:12:18.415 --> 00:12:19.355]  It was like astonishing.
[00:12:19.375 --> 00:12:20.976]  And then I had to listen to it at dinner.
[00:12:21.617 --> 00:12:24.018]  And I was sort of like, I'm going to kill Susan Wojcicki first.
[00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:24.359]  Okay.
[00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:25.820]  There I am.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:43.642]  But it was sort of like, I was sort of like, is there anything like, it feels like, as I said, I think you've heard me say this, it feels like all you tech companies have built cities, these beautiful cities, but you decided not to initially put in police, fire, garbage, street signs.
[00:12:46.465 --> 00:12:52.231]  And her brain damage behind the Nazi stuff are probably clips of Tucker Carlson or PewDiePie.
[00:12:52.352 --> 00:12:55.475]  And then I've got like this kid who's like, well Ben Shapiro's sort of smart.
[00:12:55.515 --> 00:12:56.156]  I'm like, no he's not!
[00:12:56.316 --> 00:12:57.437]  Not even slightly!
[00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:02.341]  He's clever, but he's an idiot, and anyway, it's just like, it's exhausting.
[00:13:02.541 --> 00:13:04.342]  But it has like a huge effect on them.
[00:13:04.702 --> 00:13:15.467]  Do you feel like the people, on a bigger thing, and it's not your total responsibility, Susan, but it's, do you feel like the people of Silicon Valley have a sense of this, of the impact they have?
[00:13:15.527 --> 00:13:19.609]  Folks, I'm gonna have to come back and play the rest of this, it's so incredible, I'm backing up about 30 seconds.
[00:13:20.129 --> 00:13:24.451]  So you got this woman, married to the woman who was the head of
[00:13:25.151 --> 00:13:27.152]  Internet technology development for Obama.
[00:13:27.332 --> 00:13:29.413]  That means controlling the new rollout of censorship.
[00:13:30.213 --> 00:13:41.118]  And she's saying, my son likes Ben Shapiro and it's horrible so she wants to use her power like a giant internet TV changer.
[00:13:43.699 --> 00:13:49.162]  Or basically giant internet parental controls because Ben Shapiro needs to be stopped.
[00:13:49.966 --> 00:13:54.687]  Lady, you're not going to stop your son from rebelling against your authoritarian leftist crap.
[00:13:55.547 --> 00:13:57.788]  That's why humans genetically the young rebel.
[00:13:58.168 --> 00:14:00.469]  Even if your parents are great, they still rebel.
[00:14:00.549 --> 00:14:04.670]  God put that in us to take us on a new course in case we have bad parents.
[00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.070]  That's how the change works.
[00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.031]  It's meant so your kids don't stay with you.
[00:14:09.491 --> 00:14:10.431]  They're meant to move out.
[00:14:10.891 --> 00:14:11.972]  So they're meant about 13, 14 genetically.
[00:14:15.014 --> 00:14:22.578]  To try to differentiate from you, you know, you're such a big leftist, you're so smart, and so they're going to try to be the opposite of you.
[00:14:23.198 --> 00:14:39.146]  So if you wanted leftist sons who wanted to, you know, take Prozac and Ritalin and, you know, take chemicals to be castrated or whatever, you would pose as a right winger that beat them and, you know, told them that sex was dirty or whatever.
[00:14:39.446 --> 00:14:40.827]  Then you'd get a leftist, maybe.
[00:14:41.758 --> 00:14:43.319]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.442]  Now you're saying you can't have Ben Shapiro or Alex Jones.
[00:14:47.222 --> 00:14:48.743]  It's over, lady.
[00:14:49.224 --> 00:14:50.785]  You'll never be able to censor.
[00:14:50.965 --> 00:14:52.246]  You'll never be able to control it.
[00:14:52.626 --> 00:14:55.008]  China, the Chi-Coms are going to lose control.
[00:14:55.408 --> 00:14:56.449]  You're going to lose control.
[00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:58.331]  Nationalism is spreading all over the world.
[00:14:58.351 --> 00:15:05.836]  We'll come back with the rest of this intriguing report that's posted on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:15:06.237 --> 00:15:07.578]  Please, never forget.
[00:15:09.207 --> 00:15:25.276]  If you want to be able to tune into this fusion of analysis and punditry and humor and all these guests and everything, you've got to go to one of our local radio stations or TV stations or you've got to go to Infowars.com and Newswars.com and they're working around the clock.
[00:15:25.957 --> 00:15:28.178]  Oliver Darcy at CNN is now to get
[00:15:29.557 --> 00:15:32.139]  Our actual content host taken down.
[00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:36.481]  They're working around the clock, the wolves that are around us here at the fire.
[00:15:36.921 --> 00:15:40.904]  We've got our torches in the night, still moving forward, still battling, still marching.
[00:15:41.164 --> 00:15:46.567]  But we need your financial support, we need your prayers, and we need something more important than just financial support.
[00:15:46.887 --> 00:15:54.411]  We need you to carry the ball and by word of mouth tell them newswars.com, infowars.com.
[00:15:54.692 --> 00:15:58.434]  Find out why criminals and pedophiles and degenerates everywhere hate us.
[00:15:58.894 --> 00:16:00.695]  Because we know how to beat them!
[00:16:02.916 --> 00:16:06.797]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[00:16:07.577 --> 00:16:11.399]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[00:16:11.819 --> 00:16:18.842]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[00:16:19.762 --> 00:16:21.983]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[00:16:22.863 --> 00:16:26.345]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[00:16:27.685 --> 00:16:30.647]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[00:16:30.827 --> 00:16:32.347]  We are the power structure.
[00:16:32.868 --> 00:16:33.888]  We are the inventors.
[00:16:34.468 --> 00:16:35.509]  We are the trailblazers.
[00:16:36.249 --> 00:16:39.071]  And the globalists understand that.
[00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:45.594]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[00:16:46.754 --> 00:16:50.556]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[00:16:51.602 --> 00:17:00.573]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off at importrestore.com.
[00:17:00.733 --> 00:17:02.075]  Something everybody should take advantage of.
[00:17:03.629 --> 00:17:12.497]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist, pro-free market, pro-Western speech all across the world.
[00:17:13.318 --> 00:17:19.223]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last year to be de-platformed.
[00:17:19.783 --> 00:17:20.784]  Then they set the precedent.
[00:17:21.285 --> 00:17:25.428]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert,
[00:17:26.149 --> 00:17:27.550]  They take you off the internet.
[00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:37.538]  Now, Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of most types on their platform because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[00:17:38.418 --> 00:17:49.026]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist, anti-human, transhumanist, who literally think they own and run our lives.
[00:17:49.246 --> 00:17:50.908]  And if we keep bowing to these cults,
[00:17:51.508 --> 00:17:57.532]  The cancer that is San Francisco and many of these big universities is going to be the operating system of the planet.
[00:17:57.992 --> 00:18:01.494]  Humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks!
[00:18:02.739 --> 00:18:08.122]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.
[00:18:08.443 --> 00:18:10.464]  Alpha Power, at 50% off.
[00:18:11.064 --> 00:18:14.226]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.

[00:18:23.652 --> 00:18:31.858]  Alpha Power's incredible ingredients can help you boost your sport performance or enhance your day-to-day life with ease while encouraging hormonal balance.
[00:18:32.398 --> 00:18:37.423]  Perfect by itself or with super male vitality in the true alpha male pack.
[00:18:37.823 --> 00:18:44.529]  Alpha Power can help boost performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels, support healthy cholesterol and more.
[00:18:45.069 --> 00:18:48.352]  Let Alpha Power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[00:18:48.752 --> 00:18:51.495]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny.
[00:18:51.795 --> 00:18:59.202]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with Alpha Power at 50% off only at the Info Wars store.
[00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:05.212]  I want to say brain force is great.
[00:19:05.292 --> 00:19:07.073]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[00:19:07.193 --> 00:19:07.613]  It is.
[00:19:07.793 --> 00:19:12.196]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[00:19:12.677 --> 00:19:13.957]  The fish oil is better than it.
[00:19:14.017 --> 00:19:15.759]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:19:15.839 --> 00:19:18.180]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.881]  Brain, body, heart.
[00:19:19.961 --> 00:19:21.362]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[00:19:21.422 --> 00:19:22.643]  You've got the children's.
[00:19:22.783 --> 00:19:23.744]  You've got the adults.
[00:19:23.884 --> 00:19:24.804]  You've got the krill oil.
[00:19:24.904 --> 00:19:28.266]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[00:19:28.286 --> 00:19:30.648]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[00:19:31.008 --> 00:19:32.890]  It'll give you the damn burps, and I'm sorry.
[00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:33.991]  You want something like this?
[00:19:34.071 --> 00:19:34.932]  You don't get stuff for free.
[00:19:35.032 --> 00:19:36.914]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:19:36.975 --> 00:19:38.096]  It's so good, in my view.
[00:19:38.176 --> 00:19:40.378]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[00:19:40.518 --> 00:19:43.121]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[00:19:43.221 --> 00:19:44.863]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:19:46.625 --> 00:19:51.170]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:19:54.107 --> 00:20:00.095]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:20:00.155 --> 00:20:00.936]  I just can't do it!
[00:20:05.982 --> 00:20:08.605]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:35.237 --> 00:21:03.272]  So, we're playing clips of Kara Swisher, and she was married to Megan Smith, Dr. McCam's shot please, and you're tuned into the Alex Jones Show, and she's up there talking about how they want to censor the internet, because her son is tuned in to Ben Shapiro, who's a gateway drug, to Jordan Peterson, and then you find people like, you know, Mark Dyson, Alex Jones, God forbid.
[00:21:04.895 --> 00:21:06.716]  And so that's why you're seeing all this draconian censorship.
[00:21:06.756 --> 00:21:07.256]  Think about this.
[00:21:07.736 --> 00:21:12.097]  There are tons of articles out yesterday and today saying Jones had another YouTube channel banned.
[00:21:12.357 --> 00:21:13.538]  Well, it wasn't our YouTube channel.
[00:21:14.098 --> 00:21:17.439]  Because on the channel, it said false flag.
[00:21:18.239 --> 00:21:33.024]  And the video that they are talking about is Rush Limbaugh saying a lot of people are saying this guy's a leftist from his own manifesto, where he says he's an eco-fascist, where he says that he loves Communist China, where he says he's not a conservative.
[00:21:34.412 --> 00:21:37.573]  And then he's doing this to create a class of civilizations.
[00:21:37.893 --> 00:21:39.253]  Well, that would be a false flag.
[00:21:39.813 --> 00:21:41.154]  It doesn't mean nobody died.
[00:21:41.594 --> 00:21:43.054]  It doesn't mean people didn't get shot.
[00:21:43.915 --> 00:21:47.175]  It means, like the PENAC document written by Dick Cheney in 2000.
[00:21:47.375 --> 00:21:51.757]  He said, if we have about 3,000 people die, the same size as Pearl Harbor.
[00:21:52.137 --> 00:21:52.757]  He actually said this.
[00:21:54.312 --> 00:22:05.358]  He said if the same number of people died, say like a new Pearl Harbor event, we could use that as a catalyst for a new American century and have a clash of civilizations between the West and Islam, and crush Islam.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.281]  Now as much as I don't like radical expanding Islam, I wasn't for that.
[00:22:13.222 --> 00:22:16.804]  And I read Rebuilding America's Defenses dozens of times on air.
[00:22:17.915 --> 00:22:21.236]  That doesn't mean 9-11 didn't happen, towers didn't come down, people didn't get killed.
[00:22:21.556 --> 00:22:27.177]  It meant our government at highest levels was allowing the attacks to take place, and that since then come out!
[00:22:28.897 --> 00:22:34.738]  And they don't want me to be able to question that, so instead, I start getting phone calls from people going, hey, are you saying this didn't happen?
[00:22:34.898 --> 00:22:35.838]  No, I didn't say that.
[00:22:36.578 --> 00:22:40.979]  So when you read the articles, it'll never have quotes other than false flag.
[00:22:43.059 --> 00:22:46.500]  Well, I could say this is not a false flag, and then they'd still have false flag up there.
[00:22:47.506 --> 00:22:53.788]  And it's not a classic false flag where you totally go, you know, blow something up yourself and then blame it on somebody.
[00:22:54.088 --> 00:22:58.030]  Or attack your own military base and blame it on somebody, like Operation Hemlock that started World War II.
[00:23:01.151 --> 00:23:01.731]  That's on record.
[00:23:02.371 --> 00:23:06.193]  But it, it, he says in the manifesto, I'm doing this
[00:23:07.421 --> 00:23:10.983]  To cause a global race war just like Charlie Manson did in 1969.
[00:23:12.304 --> 00:23:22.251]  Well, when you say you're trying to stage a horrible provocation to start a larger war, that is the definition of a provocative provocateur false flag.
[00:23:22.411 --> 00:23:23.392]  There's different types.
[00:23:26.194 --> 00:23:34.780]  But the corporate media lies to you and says Jones's channel was also taken down for showing the massacre.
[00:23:36.221 --> 00:23:36.581]  That's what
[00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:42.891]  How do you even say the name of this site?
[00:23:43.172 --> 00:23:43.652]  EdgeNet?
[00:23:44.372 --> 00:23:46.294]  E-N-G-A-D-G-E.
[00:23:46.654 --> 00:23:47.335]  I know it's a big site.
[00:23:47.375 --> 00:23:48.436]  I can never read it right.
[00:23:48.456 --> 00:23:49.036]  I'm so ignorant.
[00:23:50.397 --> 00:23:52.859]  And it says here that I also showed the massacre.
[00:23:52.919 --> 00:23:53.480]  No, we didn't.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:54.881]  We showed what the news showed.
[00:23:55.221 --> 00:23:56.242]  Him getting out of the car.
[00:23:59.044 --> 00:23:59.805]  Blurred video.
[00:23:59.845 --> 00:24:02.046]  But, oh, CNN can show it.
[00:24:02.207 --> 00:24:03.708]  We can't show it.
[00:24:06.773 --> 00:24:09.535]  Absolutely outrageous that they do this type of crap.
[00:24:09.916 --> 00:24:27.270]  But you hear this woman, who scores all the big interviews with big tech, she's the darling, and they're talking about how they're going to keep their kids from watching popular nationalists, right-wingers, and others.
[00:24:28.531 --> 00:24:32.194]  And you hear the disconnect and the arrogance as if she'll ever be successful.
[00:24:32.434 --> 00:24:34.856]  You suppress something, you only make it hotter.
[00:24:35.828 --> 00:24:37.448]  Let's go back to Mark Dice's report.
[00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:40.729]  I can't wait to hear.
[00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:46.431]  My son, who's 13 years old, started watching Ben Shapiro videos.
[00:24:46.571 --> 00:24:49.552]  And he's like the gateway drug to the next group.
[00:24:49.612 --> 00:24:51.012]  And then it goes right to Jordan Peterson.
[00:24:51.052 --> 00:24:51.832]  And then it goes down.
[00:24:51.872 --> 00:24:53.973]  And in three clicks, he was at neo-Nazi stuff.
[00:24:54.373 --> 00:24:55.333]  It was like astonishing.
[00:24:55.353 --> 00:24:56.954]  And then I had to listen to it at dinner.
[00:24:57.574 --> 00:24:59.974]  And I was sort of like, I'm going to kill Susan Wojcicki first.
[00:25:00.074 --> 00:25:01.775]  There I am.
[00:25:02.655 --> 00:25:22.527]  But it was sort of like, I was sort of like, is there anything like, it feels like, as I said, I think you've heard me say this, it feels like all you tech companies have built cities, these beautiful cities, but you decided not to initially put in police, fire, garbage, street signs, and stuff like that.
[00:25:24.264 --> 00:25:27.266]  The internet was millions of sites and you surf the web and it was beautiful.
[00:25:27.566 --> 00:25:33.509]  Then big tech got together with these conglomerates to build their own contained systems so they can control you.
[00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:38.412]  They get you on YouTube, they get you on Facebook and Twitter, and then they start the tyranny.
[00:25:38.912 --> 00:25:40.193]  We built all these sites.
[00:25:40.553 --> 00:25:42.074]  People's content built them.
[00:25:43.214 --> 00:25:44.255]  Without us, you're nothing.
[00:25:44.455 --> 00:25:48.417]  But it's this elitist attitude that we're lucky to even be on their platforms.
[00:25:48.937 --> 00:25:49.658]  You see how that works?
[00:25:49.698 --> 00:25:50.178]  Let's continue.
[00:25:51.924 --> 00:25:56.510]  The Nazi stuff are probably clips of Tucker Carlson or PewDiePie.
[00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:59.733]  And then I've got like this kid who's like, well Ben Shapiro's sort of smart.
[00:25:59.773 --> 00:26:01.776]  I'm like, no he's not, no he's not, not even slightly.
[00:26:03.258 --> 00:26:04.659]  He's clever, but he's an idiot.
[00:26:04.679 --> 00:26:06.601]  Anyway, it's just like, it's exhausting.
[00:26:06.822 --> 00:26:08.624]  But it has like a huge effect on them.
[00:26:08.984 --> 00:26:10.025]  Do you feel like...
[00:26:10.586 --> 00:26:19.772]  The people, on a bigger thing, and it's not your total responsibility, Susan, but it's, do you feel like the people sitting on there have a sense of this, of the impact they have?
[00:26:20.033 --> 00:26:21.414]  So, getting to your son.
[00:26:21.434 --> 00:26:22.795]  He's lost.
[00:26:23.375 --> 00:26:26.197]  No, we can work on your son here.
[00:26:26.297 --> 00:26:30.040]  I have a son too, and I get some of these discussions also at the dinner table.
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:45.445]  I mean, so... She just said that her 13-year-old son was lost because he's not a social justice warrior, and he's looking up conservative videos on YouTube, and maybe looking to Jordan Peterson as a father figure because he's being raised by two lesbians.
[00:26:45.745 --> 00:26:49.566]  Maybe the poor kid should be put into a foster home consisting of a normal family.
[00:26:49.786 --> 00:26:51.427]  You know, a husband and a wife.
[00:26:51.587 --> 00:26:58.273]  I think what you're describing is, and the way we think about it too, look, there's a set of content that has to meet the community guidelines.
[00:26:58.333 --> 00:27:00.315]  Ben Shapiro's going to meet the community guidelines.
[00:27:00.335 --> 00:27:03.097]  So I don't think you're suggesting that we remove him from the platform.
[00:27:03.257 --> 00:27:03.517]  Are you?
[00:27:04.038 --> 00:27:05.119]  I would, but I can't.
[00:27:05.299 --> 00:27:05.679]  No, no.
[00:27:05.759 --> 00:27:06.140]  Okay.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:10.383]  But you know, last time I saw you, I was like, get Alex Jones off that platform.
[00:27:10.403 --> 00:27:12.365]  And you're like, well, the community guidelines.
[00:27:12.405 --> 00:27:13.206]  And then you got him off.
[00:27:13.226 --> 00:27:14.247]  Now he's not on the platform.
[00:27:14.267 --> 00:27:14.547]  I know.
[00:27:14.707 --> 00:27:15.328]  So I was right.
[00:27:15.388 --> 00:27:16.369]  But that's enough.
[00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.730]  Get him off!
[00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:25.056]  She literally said if it was up to her she would ban Ben Shapiro for the same reasons that she wanted Alex Jones banned.
[00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:27.498]  Now I am no fan of Ben Shapiro.
[00:27:27.578 --> 00:27:28.899]  I know that a lot of you guys are.
[00:27:28.939 --> 00:27:43.411]  I just can't trust a guy who basically endorsed Hillary Clinton by default shortly before the 2016 election by announcing that he would never vote for Donald Trump and said that if Trump wins that he will never appoint conservatives to the Supreme Court.
[00:27:43.431 --> 00:27:45.653]  There's a whole bunch of reasons why I don't like
[00:27:46.053 --> 00:27:47.014]  Neocon Ben.
[00:27:47.234 --> 00:27:51.376]  Trump's three biggest crowds are evangelicals, conservatives, and he's a winner voters.
[00:27:51.796 --> 00:27:53.176]  Trump is lying to all of them.
[00:27:53.597 --> 00:27:55.037]  Stop buying the lies.
[00:27:55.297 --> 00:27:58.839]  Because as entertaining as Donald Trump is, Donald Trump is a liar.
[00:27:58.939 --> 00:28:07.483]  And don't even get me started about him supporting Michelle Field's hoax about getting assaulted and almost thrown to the ground by Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.
[00:28:07.703 --> 00:28:10.705]  He's about as Republican establishment as you can get.
[00:28:11.025 --> 00:28:12.766]  He's neocon to the core.
[00:28:13.106 --> 00:28:16.791]  He has billionaire backers who built his entire career.
[00:28:16.971 --> 00:28:29.507]  But because he has such a following amongst college kids, Kara Swisher sees him as the new Alex Jones who needs to be censored from the internet because he says such controversial things like, there are only two genders.
[00:28:29.827 --> 00:28:32.588]  That is considered to be hate speech by the liberals today.
[00:28:33.028 --> 00:28:38.531]  And there was a gamer on Twitch who was reportedly banned for saying that on one of her live streams.
[00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:44.373]  And as you know, I was briefly suspended and locked out of my Twitter account for tweeting that.
[00:28:44.633 --> 00:28:52.356]  Since basically breathing is a violation of the terms of service of these big tech companies, technically Ben has violated their policies.
[00:28:52.576 --> 00:28:53.657]  Alright, great job.
[00:28:53.717 --> 00:28:57.518]  Mark Dice, full report, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, MarkDice.com.
[00:28:57.798 --> 00:28:58.719]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:29:03.949 --> 00:29:13.376]  We're going to do, this Thursday through Friday through Saturday, a 50-hour emergency Save the First Amendment broadcast with a bunch of special guests and a bunch of stuff we've never done before.
[00:29:13.516 --> 00:29:14.637]  Believe me, this is going to be special.
[00:29:14.737 --> 00:29:15.597]  Thursday 8 a.m.
[00:29:15.617 --> 00:29:19.200]  with David Knight, right through Saturday 10 a.m., 50 hours, a bunch of special guests.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:25.084]  We're going to blur out the violence, but we're going to look at all the anomalies, not even saying there's anomalies.
[00:29:25.224 --> 00:29:26.465]  We have a right to.
[00:29:26.665 --> 00:29:31.389]  The truth is, governments do do stuff like this, and it's legitimate for anybody to ask those type of questions.
[00:29:34.617 --> 00:29:42.125]  Dare I say, we're about to be joined by the Rembrandt, the Da Vinci of meme-making, Carpe Dantum.
[00:29:42.365 --> 00:29:49.493]  But let's look at the meme that Carpe Dantum made that President Trump shared that was then censored on Twitter.
[00:29:50.454 --> 00:29:52.355]  Madam Speaker!
[00:29:52.676 --> 00:29:55.058]  The President of the United States!
[00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:06.318]  Thank you very much.
[00:30:26.431 --> 00:30:41.098]  Madam Speaker, members of Congress, the state of our union is strong.
[00:30:41.918 --> 00:30:50.342]  Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.
[00:30:54.155 --> 00:30:57.232]  Because there ain't no doubt I love this land
[00:31:02.455 --> 00:31:10.062]  So, Carpe Doctum joins me now, and I gotta be honest with you folks, I feel like right now I'm interviewing one of the greatest artists of all time.
[00:31:10.142 --> 00:31:13.605]  So, Carpe Doctum, thank you for joining me today on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:13.746 --> 00:31:15.167]  So, let's talk about the name.
[00:31:15.467 --> 00:31:22.934]  Obviously, Carpe Diem, Seize the Day, the famous saying, and then you have Carpe Noctum, which is Seize the Night.
[00:31:23.134 --> 00:31:25.596]  So, Carpe Doctum, is that Seize the Donk?
[00:31:25.797 --> 00:31:27.138]  It's Seize the Donkey.
[00:31:27.718 --> 00:31:30.420]  That is my interpretation of my fake Latin, yes.
[00:31:45.635 --> 00:31:48.597]  Well, I have to say, you've done a lot of great work, obviously.
[00:31:48.617 --> 00:31:49.937]  Your creativity shines through.
[00:31:50.097 --> 00:31:53.019]  If you don't want to get into this, I understand, but I need an answer here.
[00:31:53.179 --> 00:32:00.363]  Can you confirm or deny that you were the character featured in Make Love Not Warcraft in South Park?
[00:32:01.003 --> 00:32:04.225]  Now, we've got the clip, and there have been some theories, okay?
[00:32:04.245 --> 00:32:11.489]  There have been some theories branded about here that this character from South Park, Make Love Not Warcraft, is actually based on you.
[00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:14.671]  Now, can you confirm or deny these claims right now?
[00:32:15.271 --> 00:32:20.496]  I can't confirm or deny right now.
[00:32:20.516 --> 00:32:22.939]  I can't confirm or deny.
[00:32:23.159 --> 00:32:26.362]  I just know that InfoWars is the sword of a thousand triggers.
[00:32:32.822 --> 00:32:35.704]  BODYZ uses a medicinal herb of thousands of years, turmeric.
[00:32:35.764 --> 00:32:37.945]  It's one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[00:32:38.326 --> 00:32:43.649]  It is there for the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support.
[00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:52.014]  And it's got the turmeric root extract, the boswellia serrata extract, organic spearmint, sage, lemon balm, thyme leaves, and piperine from black pepper.
[00:32:52.354 --> 00:32:57.297]  It will help you take control of your body and feel the power of turmeric like never before.
[00:32:57.838 --> 00:33:01.120]  Right now at infowarsstore.com, please support this network.
[00:33:07.003 --> 00:33:09.725]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.456 --> 00:33:29.680]  Live, raw, and unfiltered, it's The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:46.835 --> 00:33:56.763]  All right, I'm going to get into this extremely powerful CounterThink episode that Mike Adams put together for InfoWars.
[00:33:57.423 --> 00:34:02.487]  Every Sunday, after my Sunday live show ends, 4 to 6 p.m., at 6 p.m.
[00:34:02.527 --> 00:34:07.311]  Central, CounterThink is a hard-hitting hour that he works a lot on.
[00:34:07.531 --> 00:34:15.818]  And sometimes the production's like HBO or something, other times it's just like this, you know, clips and videos and, you know, kind of radio put to television.
[00:34:17.315 --> 00:34:29.461]  But when I got off the air, I was in my office going over some notes, and there was a TV in there, and I turned it on, as I routinely do, and it was a particularly powerful counter thing that you can find at brighteon.com.
[00:34:30.161 --> 00:34:43.708]  I'm going to ask the crew, obviously, to take this full episode, I think we already do that anyways, and upload it to the front page of infowars.com, because it's powerful, and it deals with the lunacy of the left and how
[00:34:44.708 --> 00:34:55.018]  The craziest amongst them in the corporations, the universities, and in the businesses, becomes the leader, and then they get replaced by somebody even more extreme, and it's what happened to Islam.
[00:34:55.699 --> 00:35:01.004]  And it's what happened to Christianity during the Dark Ages, where it just gets absolutely out of control.
[00:35:02.205 --> 00:35:03.747]  You'd catch a woman in the Middle Ages,
[00:35:05.509 --> 00:35:10.832]  Keepin' some herbs or something that she knew kept her baby alive during the winter.
[00:35:11.772 --> 00:35:12.792]  And they'd say, you're a witch.
[00:35:13.313 --> 00:35:14.173]  And they'd kill your ass.
[00:35:15.754 --> 00:35:19.456]  So that's how this stuff works, where knowledge is evil and knowledge is bad.
[00:35:19.496 --> 00:35:23.998]  And that's what the left's saying about language and communication, and that there's two genders.
[00:35:24.058 --> 00:35:26.079]  And people say, well, why am I obsessed with this?
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:28.940]  Because they're obsessed with it.
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:53.806]  And if they can make us accept that there are 50 genders, and that they can make us accept that a full-grown man can identify as a child and then come date your five-year-old son or daughter, or if they can let convicted sex offenders come to your school and tell your kids that they should be a tranny for career day, that's incredibly abusive and insane and takes advantage of our open, free society.
[00:35:55.267 --> 00:36:01.449]  And notice the left is what wants to end the open free society that's tolerant and make us accept their cultural death.
[00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:06.511]  What they are is a bunch of followers led by a bunch of cult leaders.
[00:36:07.131 --> 00:36:07.851]  It's very, very dangerous.
[00:36:07.871 --> 00:36:09.272]  We're going to go to that.
[00:36:09.312 --> 00:36:11.172]  Just five, six minutes of the hour report.
[00:36:11.913 --> 00:36:17.395]  Here in just a little while we're going to post the full video to the front page of newswars.com and infowars.com.
[00:36:17.435 --> 00:36:18.375]  I'm going to say this again.
[00:36:19.921 --> 00:36:27.163]  We're in a total war against the globalists and we're promoting things that work and are popular and are historical.
[00:36:27.583 --> 00:36:29.864]  We're promoting why everybody wanted to come to the U.S.
[00:36:29.904 --> 00:36:34.425]  back when we actually tried to follow those great ideas, the American ethos.
[00:36:35.225 --> 00:36:37.026]  And so I'm not inventing any of this.
[00:36:37.646 --> 00:36:39.726]  I'm just trying to bring it back in the 21st century.
[00:36:40.107 --> 00:36:40.527]  And guess what?
[00:36:40.667 --> 00:36:41.447]  Folks are buying.
[00:36:43.168 --> 00:36:46.489]  People want to live in free, prosperous, good countries.
[00:36:47.289 --> 00:36:50.329]  Where we are tolerant, but we recognize what is superior.
[00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:51.690]  The family.
[00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:52.730]  Men being men.
[00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:53.530]  Women being women.
[00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.910]  Savings.
[00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:56.210]  Religious freedom.
[00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:57.611]  Sovereignty.
[00:36:57.971 --> 00:37:01.291]  Honoring truthful people.
[00:37:02.211 --> 00:37:02.931]  Real community.
[00:37:04.032 --> 00:37:07.412]  And the globalists are threatened by that because they can't compete with it.
[00:37:07.472 --> 00:37:11.353]  They want society that's falling apart.
[00:37:12.881 --> 00:37:14.762]  Now we're going to get to this report in a moment.
[00:37:17.144 --> 00:37:29.371]  We had a father call in yesterday and he said, hey, are you going to air this video piece that my young son put together promoting your protein bars?
[00:37:29.431 --> 00:37:30.212]  I said, I haven't seen it.
[00:37:32.202 --> 00:37:35.944]  And so he sent it in, and here's this report.
[00:37:35.984 --> 00:37:51.671]  And the reason this is so important is, when the listeners get active, call into C-SPAN, go to City Council and speak out, go to the PTA, write a book, create a website, send an email, call Congress, make a fan-based promo video for InfoWars.
[00:37:52.031 --> 00:37:54.152]  When you do that, it changes the world.
[00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:56.713]  That's where the real power is, is at the grassroots.
[00:37:56.753 --> 00:37:58.594]  So we salute this young man.
[00:37:58.634 --> 00:37:59.114]  Here's the video.
[00:38:00.882 --> 00:38:02.483]  You wanna know how good this stuff is?
[00:38:03.403 --> 00:38:04.824]  What's it called, you may ask?
[00:38:05.645 --> 00:38:08.186]  It's called the M4's Protein Bar.
[00:38:09.387 --> 00:38:12.149]  Now, you might be wondering, what does it taste like?
[00:38:12.569 --> 00:38:13.970]  It's not a protein bar.
[00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:17.572]  It's legit chocolate brownie with chocolate.
[00:38:18.072 --> 00:38:20.634]  It's so delicious, it doesn't even taste like a protein bar.
[00:38:21.454 --> 00:38:25.957]  An adorable young man, that's Prince Franks, and he put together that little promo video.
[00:38:27.626 --> 00:38:30.488]  And by the way, we're selling out of the protein bars.
[00:38:31.569 --> 00:38:34.611]  And so we had to end the 50% off on those.
[00:38:34.651 --> 00:38:35.872]  Everything else is 50% off.
[00:38:36.272 --> 00:38:37.713]  We're about to have to end the turbo force.
[00:38:37.753 --> 00:38:39.174]  I think we just did because that's selling out.
[00:38:39.534 --> 00:38:42.336]  Everything else is still in somewhat of abundance.
[00:38:42.796 --> 00:38:44.357]  The fish oil is getting close to selling out.
[00:38:44.758 --> 00:38:45.738]  Storewide free shipping 50% off.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:53.322]  We went to, again, three of the top organic manufacturers of protein bars about a year and a half ago.
[00:38:53.342 --> 00:38:54.842]  It took over a year to get this done.
[00:38:55.543 --> 00:38:58.624]  We said we wanted organic, we wanted high quality, and we don't want any filler.
[00:38:59.504 --> 00:39:04.346]  And they came back and they said, well, nobody out there doesn't not put filler in it.
[00:39:04.366 --> 00:39:08.287]  It's because people are used to something that has some filler.
[00:39:10.171 --> 00:39:13.752]  And this is the equivalent of a $5, $6, $7 bar for $3.
[00:39:14.012 --> 00:39:17.213]  When you get it discounted, it's $1.50 with the special we had.
[00:39:17.593 --> 00:39:18.413]  And it comes in boxes of 12.
[00:39:20.313 --> 00:39:21.573]  And I'll be honest with you.
[00:39:25.034 --> 00:39:27.035]  It takes a while to eat one of these.
[00:39:28.715 --> 00:39:31.696]  It's unlike any other protein bar you've ever had because there is no filler.
[00:39:32.396 --> 00:39:33.736]  It tastes really good, by the way.
[00:39:35.077 --> 00:39:43.125]  But then I got why the developers are like, you sure you don't want to add some wheat or add a little bit of cornstarch or, you know, add some of those things in there?
[00:39:43.465 --> 00:39:46.007]  Because people aren't used to something being this solid.
[00:39:47.108 --> 00:39:48.730]  You've never eaten fudge this solid.
[00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:52.313]  You've never eaten... Toffee is easier to eat than this.
[00:39:52.433 --> 00:39:58.159]  And I mean, it's not a bad thing, but they taste incredibly good, but I was driving
[00:40:00.384 --> 00:40:11.471]  When we were developing them and the final edition came in, and I was driving to Fredericksburg, and it's an hour and a half drive, it took me, with a big ol' bottle of water, 30 minutes to eat one little bar.
[00:40:14.493 --> 00:40:15.774]  Because there's no fillers.
[00:40:16.795 --> 00:40:17.816]  It's solid.
[00:40:18.576 --> 00:40:19.757]  Now you can bite into it easily.
[00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:23.860]  But you're gonna be like, what in the world's going on here?
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.462]  But here I am plugging something that's sold out, basically, so it doesn't matter.
[00:40:29.465 --> 00:40:30.630]  We have storewide free shipping.
[00:40:31.353 --> 00:40:32.116]  Infowarstore.com
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.201]  Everything is in abundance except the protein bars and TurboForce.
[00:40:37.241 --> 00:40:39.562]  Those have been taken off the sale, at least they were supposed to be.
[00:40:39.582 --> 00:40:42.603]  Then we've got BrainForce Plus, the great nootropic.
[00:40:43.163 --> 00:40:44.984]  It's going to end up selling out in the next few weeks.
[00:40:45.004 --> 00:40:47.905]  We'll have to pull that special in about four or five days.
[00:40:48.926 --> 00:40:53.747]  The other great products are selling out as well are the fish oils.
[00:40:53.807 --> 00:40:59.209]  We have the Honorol, that's a spectrum of the oils that are great for the brain particularly.
[00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:02.751]  They're great for children, great for adults, but it's smaller capsules for children.
[00:41:04.082 --> 00:41:05.602]  It's the very best you're going to find out there.
[00:41:07.083 --> 00:41:10.444]  Then you've got the wild harvested salmon fjord oil.
[00:41:11.544 --> 00:41:12.884]  It's excellent for adults.
[00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:15.785]  And then you have the krill oil.
[00:41:16.505 --> 00:41:20.586]  And again, they're like, okay, you don't want it basically boiled.
[00:41:20.626 --> 00:41:21.726]  You don't want it denatured.
[00:41:21.766 --> 00:41:22.286]  You don't want it.
[00:41:22.706 --> 00:41:25.627]  You want it raw, except for the extraction process that takes the mercury out.
[00:41:25.947 --> 00:41:26.627]  And I said, yeah.
[00:41:27.608 --> 00:41:30.868]  And so I'll tell you, the krill oil is the strongest stuff you've ever been around.
[00:41:31.488 --> 00:41:33.089]  But I'll tell you, you better eat it with some food.
[00:41:34.028 --> 00:41:39.892]  You don't get the burpees with the honor roll and the fish oil, ultimate fish oil.
[00:41:40.413 --> 00:41:44.015]  But the krill oil is dynamite and it's strong.
[00:41:44.376 --> 00:41:47.598]  And there's nothing better than krill oil for your brain and for your heart and your arteries.
[00:41:47.658 --> 00:41:48.899]  It's what we're made out of.
[00:41:49.519 --> 00:41:51.661]  And it's electrochemical.
[00:41:52.021 --> 00:41:52.662]  It's just magic.
[00:41:53.022 --> 00:41:53.883]  I get more energy.
[00:41:55.859 --> 00:41:58.921]  Off the krill oil than I do off turbo force.
[00:41:58.981 --> 00:42:00.001]  Because that's what it does in the brain.
[00:42:00.642 --> 00:42:03.603]  My dad, like a decade ago, he goes, you know, you're staying up late and stuff.
[00:42:03.643 --> 00:42:07.265]  I know, you know, you're drinking wine to stay up because that has the opposite effect with me.
[00:42:07.685 --> 00:42:09.366]  Coffee doesn't work in the afternoon or at night.
[00:42:09.386 --> 00:42:13.508]  So that's why I started drinking more over the years was when I'd work all night on overnight shows and things.
[00:42:13.528 --> 00:42:17.690]  I wouldn't drink to excess, but about a glass of wine every hour would keep me up.
[00:42:18.211 --> 00:42:19.111]  It's a stimulant for me.
[00:42:19.932 --> 00:42:21.612]  And my dad said, why don't you take fish oil?
[00:42:22.093 --> 00:42:24.074]  He gave me a bottle and I was like, whoa.
[00:42:25.586 --> 00:42:28.272]  I popped two big ol' fish oils and it's like a lot of energy.
[00:42:28.292 --> 00:42:29.174]  You gotta experience it.
[00:42:29.354 --> 00:42:31.077]  And no one advertises fish oil for that.
[00:42:31.679 --> 00:42:32.821]  But that's really what it does.
[00:42:32.861 --> 00:42:33.442]  Well, the krill...
[00:42:34.994 --> 00:42:38.437]  The Krill is just... I've never experienced anything like it.
[00:42:38.797 --> 00:42:39.798]  The brain boost I get.
[00:42:40.158 --> 00:42:42.400]  Everybody's physiology is different, but it's about to sell out.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.681]  Storewide free shipping.
[00:42:44.581 --> 00:42:47.844]  And, of course, 50% off on all the supplements and a bunch of other big specials.
[00:42:48.124 --> 00:42:49.145]  Double Patriot points.
[00:42:49.405 --> 00:42:50.326]  I forgot to tell you that.
[00:42:50.846 --> 00:42:52.327]  Double Patriot points.
[00:42:52.928 --> 00:42:54.109]  Double Patriot points.
[00:42:56.010 --> 00:43:00.554]  That's 10% off on your next order and free shipping when you sign up for auto-ship at FullWorthStore.com.
[00:43:00.614 --> 00:43:02.135]  Okay, the big report with Mike Adams coming up.
[00:43:03.316 --> 00:43:06.338]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[00:43:06.699 --> 00:43:12.623]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[00:43:13.044 --> 00:43:18.848]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:21.851]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[00:43:22.131 --> 00:43:29.638]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[00:43:29.658 --> 00:43:37.866]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[00:43:38.467 --> 00:43:42.731]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[00:43:43.593 --> 00:43:47.195]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[00:43:47.395 --> 00:43:53.378]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[00:43:54.338 --> 00:44:03.203]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[00:44:03.743 --> 00:44:07.925]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[00:44:07.945 --> 00:44:09.686]  You're probably going, wait a minute.
[00:44:10.776 --> 00:44:12.600]  For the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:13.903]  It was the last run.
[00:44:13.924 --> 00:44:14.886]  It's been sold out for two months.
[00:44:15.967 --> 00:44:16.868]  How is X2 back?
[00:44:17.328 --> 00:44:20.930]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[00:44:21.411 --> 00:44:24.473]  We got put over the barrel, some industrial sabotage, we couldn't get it anymore.
[00:44:25.073 --> 00:44:35.120]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:39.103]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[00:44:39.523 --> 00:44:40.664]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[00:44:41.084 --> 00:44:45.405]  You need to do research into iodine and the iodine conspiracy for yourself.
[00:44:45.885 --> 00:44:47.686]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[00:44:48.106 --> 00:44:49.406]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[00:44:49.926 --> 00:44:52.187]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[00:44:52.727 --> 00:44:55.008]  What, like a 4.9 star on Power Reviews?
[00:44:55.608 --> 00:44:59.109]  But many of you hear me talk about this, and it's just more background chatter.
[00:44:59.949 --> 00:45:02.350]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[00:45:03.439 --> 00:45:05.761]  Is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:18.569]  So from our brain waves to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:21.591]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[00:45:22.172 --> 00:45:23.312]  So iodine is amazing.
[00:45:23.352 --> 00:45:23.913]  It's important.
[00:45:23.933 --> 00:45:26.174]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[00:45:26.234 --> 00:45:26.755]  They'll hurt you.
[00:45:27.135 --> 00:45:27.835]  This is pure.
[00:45:28.116 --> 00:45:28.816]  This is clean.
[00:45:29.156 --> 00:45:29.937]  This is amazing.
[00:45:30.257 --> 00:45:32.058]  And it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[00:45:33.579 --> 00:45:37.222]  X2, our overall best-selling product, is now back.
[00:45:37.542 --> 00:45:42.286]  X2 Original, from the very first original manufacturer.

[00:47:06.551 --> 00:47:09.166]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:57.863]  Pirates have noticed throughout history that they can oppress populations for a certain amount of time, but then there's always resistance that builds and the elite ends up getting overthrown.
[00:47:59.244 --> 00:48:09.207]  But if they can have a final revolution against the family, and against mothers and fathers, and the sexes itself, and end mammalian interaction,
[00:48:10.285 --> 00:48:25.911]  If they can scientifically conquer us, like Monsanto has produced the Terminator seed, where it doesn't produce more seeds that produce more crops, you've got to go back to Monsanto that brought you Roundup, that's been proven to give you cancer, by design, and sterilize you.
[00:48:26.711 --> 00:48:29.952]  This is all part of a planetary control operation.
[00:48:30.533 --> 00:48:31.793]  And they admit all this.
[00:48:32.633 --> 00:48:33.694]  That's what's so frustrating.
[00:48:34.514 --> 00:48:36.635]  This is the Carney Endowment's system.
[00:48:36.655 --> 00:48:39.216]  They were charged over a hundred years ago with a plan to end
[00:48:40.683 --> 00:48:50.251]  World War, after World War I. They developed a world government plan, but they said we have to end the human condition as it's known to create peace.
[00:48:52.032 --> 00:48:57.997]  Like Emperor Palpatine says in Episode 3, Now that the Jedi have been eliminated, we will have peace.
[00:48:59.118 --> 00:49:01.460]  But he means the peace of total tyranny.
[00:49:02.901 --> 00:49:06.264]  So when you think about it, it's a hardcore scientific plan, isn't it?
[00:49:07.405 --> 00:49:08.986]  And they've done it to a great extent.
[00:49:10.782 --> 00:49:12.403]  And it leads into something very nightmarish.
[00:49:12.423 --> 00:49:14.163]  So here's part of CounterThink.
[00:49:14.944 --> 00:49:20.146]  The lunacy of the left by design by Mike Adams is posted on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:49:20.206 --> 00:49:20.526]  Here it is.
[00:49:25.668 --> 00:49:28.229]  Prepare to discard your mental blinders.
[00:49:28.609 --> 00:49:33.371]  CounterThink with Mike Adams live on InfoWars.com.
[00:49:34.992 --> 00:49:36.754]  Welcome to Counter Think with Mike Adams.
[00:49:36.774 --> 00:49:46.867]  I've got a great episode for you today, beginning with a little factoid you may not have known about me, and that is that I ran track for four years in high school.
[00:49:47.628 --> 00:49:50.972]  And what's really amazing is that I ran track as a male.
[00:49:52.233 --> 00:49:53.414]  I know, it's shocking, right?
[00:49:53.454 --> 00:50:01.979]  Because today, so many males in high schools, they pretend to be girls, and then they compete on the girls track team, don't they?
[00:50:02.339 --> 00:50:10.603]  And then they win, oh, they win all these medals and all these trophies, and then they get celebrated, so much applause, oh my God, you're so courageous, and you're such an amazing athlete!
[00:50:10.944 --> 00:50:11.864]  No, that's a guy!
[00:50:11.884 --> 00:50:14.465]  That's a guy running!
[00:50:15.066 --> 00:50:18.368]  That's a guy with long hair, running with the women!
[00:50:19.383 --> 00:50:26.169]  Winning all the women's trophies, beating all the women's track high score, you know, times and records and everything.
[00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:28.511]  This is insanity today!
[00:50:30.393 --> 00:50:43.464]  When I went to high school, which admittedly was a while ago, I mean it was back in the 1980s, and when I went to high school, you know, boys ran on the boys track team and girls ran on the girls track team.
[00:50:45.174 --> 00:50:55.760]  If I had tried to say something insane like, uh, I'm going to pretend to be a girl and just win all the girls track team records, they would have thrown me off the team.
[00:50:56.981 --> 00:50:59.202]  They would have given me an atomic wedgie.
[00:50:59.802 --> 00:51:01.563]  They would have called me a fag or something.
[00:51:02.044 --> 00:51:03.064]  They would have beat me.
[00:51:03.505 --> 00:51:06.646]  I mean, they would have said, are you insane?
[00:51:06.686 --> 00:51:09.128]  The coaches would laugh you off the team.
[00:51:10.114 --> 00:51:13.377]  You'd be the laughing stock of the entire school.
[00:51:13.397 --> 00:51:14.878]  Oh my God, look at this guy!
[00:51:14.918 --> 00:51:17.540]  He thinks he wants to win the girl trophies!
[00:51:19.142 --> 00:51:20.583]  What, he can't compete with guys?
[00:51:21.424 --> 00:51:24.506]  What, you can't run against your own gender?
[00:51:24.567 --> 00:51:26.488]  No, you gotta pretend to be a girl?
[00:51:26.728 --> 00:51:28.210]  What kind of person are you?
[00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:30.652]  A cheater is what you'd be called.
[00:51:31.392 --> 00:51:37.358]  And the reason I bring this up is not to turn this into a comedy session, but to say that
[00:51:38.382 --> 00:51:44.645]  Biological males who declare themselves to be transgenders and who are competing in women's sports today, they are cheaters.
[00:51:45.325 --> 00:51:45.965]  They are cheating.
[00:51:46.966 --> 00:51:54.269]  The reason we have men's sports and women's sports is because men and women are biologically different.
[00:51:55.609 --> 00:52:03.293]  And even that fact, that self-evident fact, that men and women are biologically different, is now
[00:52:04.634 --> 00:52:06.735]  Leftists, liberals, say that that's not true.
[00:52:06.795 --> 00:52:08.916]  They say there are no biological differences.
[00:52:10.137 --> 00:52:12.858]  Well then, why do you have women's sports at all?
[00:52:13.579 --> 00:52:16.220]  Why not just have any gender sports?
[00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:21.603]  I mean, why have women's basketball, women's football, women's track, women's skiing, all that stuff?
[00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:31.086]  Did you know even the Olympics now recently announced that biological men can pretend to be women and compete against women in the Olympics?
[00:52:31.606 --> 00:52:35.510]  So, and they don't even need to undergo gender reassignment surgery anymore.
[00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:50.843]  You can just, you can have your man junk and you can, you can, you can walk in there with a beard and full of body hair, you know, built like a man, physique, a male physique, strong upper body, super athletic, and you can just say,
[00:52:51.749 --> 00:52:52.649]  Today I'm a woman.
[00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:54.691]  You know, and then you just break all the records.
[00:52:54.711 --> 00:52:55.451]  Let's stop there right now.
[00:52:55.471 --> 00:52:56.251]  Get all the gold medals.
[00:52:56.592 --> 00:52:57.072]  Let's stop.
[00:52:57.312 --> 00:53:00.033]  Hell, identify as a dachshund.
[00:53:00.794 --> 00:53:04.636]  They have a weenie dog run down in San Marcos every year.
[00:53:04.656 --> 00:53:05.076]  I've been to it.
[00:53:05.096 --> 00:53:05.956]  It's totally hilarious.
[00:53:06.136 --> 00:53:08.158]  Maybe pull up the San Marcos weenie dog run.
[00:53:08.198 --> 00:53:09.958]  Why not just have a human on their hands and knees?
[00:53:10.279 --> 00:53:14.261]  That's actually a whole movement, or where you think you're blind.
[00:53:14.901 --> 00:53:19.742]  So you have your eyes removed, and then the taxpayers have to pay for it, or they dump Drano in your eyes.
[00:53:20.283 --> 00:53:25.504]  So really, men who want to compete as women should be in the Special Olympics because they're mentally ill.
[00:53:27.505 --> 00:53:36.227]  And then we're all mentally ill under mass Stockholm Syndrome, or I guess you'd call it the Emperor's New Clothes Syndrome, where you've got men.
[00:53:37.799 --> 00:53:44.303]  Competing with women, and you've got hermaphrodites already in the Olympics that keep winning the women's races.
[00:53:44.864 --> 00:53:50.307]  You understand, because there's cash, money, and prizes, you will end up having no women in women's sports.
[00:53:51.408 --> 00:53:53.849]  You will have nothing but men saying they're women in women's sports.
[00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:58.212]  Now, obviously, if you're a TV viewer, that is an Italian pole vaulter.
[00:53:58.232 --> 00:54:05.437]  Happened to just run into that this morning, and just the beautiful female form, very graceful, so beautiful, and amazing.
[00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:07.421]  That's a woman.
[00:54:08.221 --> 00:54:12.966]  But now they have men that are about to enter the Olympics as pole vaulters.
[00:54:13.786 --> 00:54:15.928]  And I'm not going to torture you with having to watch that.
[00:54:16.949 --> 00:54:18.551]  But these are big, strong men.
[00:54:18.571 --> 00:54:19.992]  They're winning all the cycling tournaments.
[00:54:20.292 --> 00:54:23.315]  They're winning all the major races in Texas, in Connecticut.
[00:54:24.645 --> 00:54:27.447]  And imagine, your daughter has been in, what is it, swimming?
[00:54:27.928 --> 00:54:32.992]  Or your daughter has been in track, and now she gets into junior high, or high school, and there's a dude?
[00:54:33.192 --> 00:54:34.433]  Oh, and I forgot the better part.
[00:54:34.773 --> 00:54:36.455]  He's in the dressing rooms with you.
[00:54:37.015 --> 00:54:38.877]  You know, Japan passed a law this year.
[00:54:39.977 --> 00:54:46.042]  They said, you can say you're a man who's now a woman, but you have to have surgery and have your testicles removed.
[00:54:46.082 --> 00:54:46.863]  And I totally agree.
[00:54:47.263 --> 00:54:48.464]  At least go partway there.
[00:54:48.724 --> 00:54:52.568]  Take the hormones, have your genitals cut off, and I'm not saying do that.
[00:54:53.504 --> 00:54:56.606]  And then maybe we'll let you in the women's dressing room.
[00:54:58.286 --> 00:54:59.947]  I mean, you put some skin in the game.
[00:55:00.708 --> 00:55:02.909]  You put your huevos on the chopping block.
[00:55:03.989 --> 00:55:04.309]  But no.
[00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:06.390]  No, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:06.931 --> 00:55:11.493]  Every sport is already now being dominated by biological men.
[00:55:12.293 --> 00:55:14.054]  And oh, Lance Armstrong's bad.
[00:55:14.094 --> 00:55:21.338]  When all the top people were blood doping, all the top people were taking growth hormone and testosterone, he was just doing it better than they were.
[00:55:22.875 --> 00:55:24.076]  And I'm not defending Lance Armstrong.
[00:55:25.717 --> 00:55:29.739]  The point is, is that Lance Armstrong's cheating?
[00:55:30.059 --> 00:55:31.200]  Trying to be more male?
[00:55:34.102 --> 00:55:39.325]  He's shaving bags of blood, and then putting them back into his body a month later when he's grown new blood cells, so he's supercharged?
[00:55:39.605 --> 00:55:40.626]  I mean, he's cheating!
[00:55:41.727 --> 00:55:48.691]  I don't ever want to hear Lance Armstrong cheated, or anybody else cheated in the Olympics, because they let this type of thing happen.
[00:55:52.406 --> 00:55:53.287]  Look at the NBC headline.
[00:55:54.248 --> 00:55:58.590]  Trans athletes make great gains, yet resentment still flares.
[00:55:59.391 --> 00:55:59.571]  What?
[00:56:00.852 --> 00:56:09.718]  So, men move in to the space, and then they do all this.
[00:56:10.358 --> 00:56:11.099]  They dominate it.
[00:56:12.279 --> 00:56:15.341]  Men say they're women, and then they win the powerlifting against women.
[00:56:15.622 --> 00:56:18.884]  When these men couldn't even place up against other men.
[00:56:20.236 --> 00:56:28.559]  So all these sports are doing is like the NFL, ruining itself with 40% down in viewers, with all its political correctness the last three years, or Hollywood's way down.
[00:56:28.979 --> 00:56:36.881]  Just all these famous sports that go back to ancient Greece 2,500 years ago.
[00:56:37.701 --> 00:56:38.782]  They're all being ruined.
[00:56:39.042 --> 00:56:40.002]  They're all being torched.
[00:56:40.222 --> 00:56:40.903]  They're all being destroyed.
[00:56:40.923 --> 00:56:41.463]  Let me tell you something.
[00:56:41.783 --> 00:56:48.445]  People aren't going to go watch women's basketball when half of them are dudes that aren't good enough to play in the men's leagues.
[00:56:49.875 --> 00:56:53.179]  People aren't going to go watch women's baseball teams when they're dudes.
[00:56:53.919 --> 00:56:56.242]  So go ahead, destroy yourselves.
[00:56:56.723 --> 00:56:58.545]  Force-fetish your mass mental illness.
[00:56:58.745 --> 00:56:59.586]  It's crazy.
[00:56:59.606 --> 00:57:01.708]  Alright, here's what's coming up today.
[00:57:03.951 --> 00:57:08.395]  Laura Loomer, she's helped launch the whole hashtag movement.
[00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.809]  That's right.
[00:57:28.646 --> 00:57:34.550]  Please don't forget, if you don't spread the articles and the videos, if you don't tell people about the show, and say, hey, you hear it's off the air, it's not.
[00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:37.792]  You get the forbidden show at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:57:38.332 --> 00:57:39.333]  Or NewsWars.com.
[00:57:39.933 --> 00:57:43.955]  That's how we beat them, and it just makes the globalists so angry, and you're doing it.
[00:57:44.236 --> 00:57:48.398]  We're still surviving and actually growing in some ways, thanks to you, so keep it up.
[00:57:48.678 --> 00:57:51.000]  We're gonna win, but it's all in your hands.
[00:57:55.353 --> 00:58:03.323]  Thursday, March 21st, InfoWars is going to launch our longest continual broadcast for 50 hours.
[00:58:03.343 --> 00:58:11.513]  An emergency summit with the most powerful, informed guests out there on developing a plan of action.
[00:58:12.233 --> 00:58:20.538]  To stop Big Tech, the Democratic Party and others working with the UN and the EU from crushing our free speech collectively.
[00:58:21.039 --> 00:58:23.020]  We're going to show the history of censorship.
[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:29.624]  It was also CNN that demanded that radio show host Alex Jones be silenced because Jeff Zucker didn't like what he was saying.
[00:58:29.944 --> 00:58:33.706]  CNN really must think we're all idiots, giving themselves an award last week.
[00:58:34.147 --> 00:58:36.688]  CNN waged a long campaign against Jones.
[00:58:36.808 --> 00:58:37.349]  It worked.
[00:58:37.789 --> 00:58:40.451]  Jeff Zucker silenced and de-platformed his show.
[00:58:40.651 --> 00:58:42.932]  It was a stunning defeat for free speech.
[00:58:43.292 --> 00:58:46.454]  So naturally, Jeff Zucker just won the First Amendment award.
[00:58:47.495 --> 00:58:48.976]  It kicks off 8 a.m.
[00:58:49.296 --> 00:58:52.977]  for the David Knight Show this Thursday and runs till 10 a.m.
[00:58:53.398 --> 00:58:55.178]  live that Saturday.
[00:58:55.559 --> 00:58:57.299]  We're gonna have a bunch of surprise guests.
[00:58:57.339 --> 00:59:01.101]  We're gonna have Ask Me Anything special events, roundtable discussions.
[00:59:01.461 --> 00:59:02.842]  This is gonna be our most important
[00:59:03.903 --> 00:59:06.084]  24 hour plus transmission ever.
[00:59:06.565 --> 00:59:09.287]  So please tune in and get past the censors.
[00:59:09.868 --> 00:59:14.912]  Tell everybody about the links at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:59:15.712 --> 00:59:18.855]  InfoWars was supposed to already be shut down and gone.
[00:59:19.436 --> 00:59:22.778]  But thanks to you, in many ways, we're stronger than ever.
[00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:25.240]  But make no mistake, the fight is on.
[00:59:26.161 --> 00:59:31.284]  InfoWars is the test case, and if they can shut us down, they're gonna shut everything down.
[00:59:32.045 --> 00:59:39.009]  Join us this Thursday, 8 a.m., and spread the word, because you are the voice of the people.
[00:59:39.549 --> 00:59:40.890]  You can override the censors.
[00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:42.811]  You are the resistance.
[00:59:54.781 --> 01:00:00.745]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:02.005 --> 01:00:11.711]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star!
[01:00:11.751 --> 01:00:19.375]  When I grow up, I want my daughters to be able to compete in sports and be in locker rooms without big, fat, sweaty men and their ding-dongs flopping around.
[01:00:22.728 --> 01:00:25.649]  But again, I'm the person who believes that two plus two equals four.
[01:00:25.669 --> 01:00:29.330]  We now take you live to the front lines of what the enemy fears.
[01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:32.771]  The tidal force of liberty, rising!
[01:00:33.151 --> 01:00:39.193]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:00:39.393 --> 01:00:43.054]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:44.654 --> 01:00:48.975]  You know, I'm not just about complaining about problems.
[01:00:48.995 --> 01:00:50.516]  I'm about action.
[01:00:51.527 --> 01:01:09.780]  And we've seen all these former top Olympic female swimmers and all these former top tennis players and basketball players saying, this is insane to have biological men who have double the muscle mass, all the rest of this, in our sports.
[01:01:10.741 --> 01:01:20.628]  It'd be like having men compete in the MMA Ultimate Fighting Championship or UFC against women.
[01:01:22.139 --> 01:01:22.779]  It's a joke!
[01:01:23.719 --> 01:01:36.562]  It'd be like if somebody in the super heavyweight class that weighs 250 pounds says, I identify as a featherweight, or as a lightweight, or as a Walterweight.
[01:01:38.423 --> 01:01:43.464]  And then imagine Mike Tyson in his prime, 230 pounds, climbs into the ring.
[01:01:43.484 --> 01:01:43.564]  It's 1989.
[01:01:50.202 --> 01:01:51.663]  Mike Tyson swinging fish.
[01:01:51.723 --> 01:01:53.244]  Mike Tyson swinging elbows.
[01:01:53.624 --> 01:01:54.965]  Nobody can stand in his way.
[01:01:55.245 --> 01:01:56.245]  He's a wrecking crew.
[01:01:56.986 --> 01:01:59.527]  Taking all the pain of his childhood and pouring it out on you.
[01:02:00.207 --> 01:02:04.850]  Guys that weigh 40 pounds more than him, heavyweight champions can't stand in his way.
[01:02:06.075 --> 01:02:07.917]  And saying, I'm Mike Tyson.
[01:02:08.578 --> 01:02:10.901]  My voice is kind of high.
[01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:14.666]  I identify as a featherweight or as a Walter weight.
[01:02:14.986 --> 01:02:16.909]  Who's the champion?
[01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:18.230]  Lightweight?
[01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:19.812]  I don't really follow boxing that much.
[01:02:21.434 --> 01:02:23.377]  The black guy that likes to wear Louis Vuitton stuff.
[01:02:24.653 --> 01:02:25.393]  Floyd Mayweather.
[01:02:25.633 --> 01:02:35.856]  Yeah, let's put him in a time machine, and let's send him 30 years back in the past, and he can be in his prime too, and Mike Tyson goes, I identify as a lightweight!
[01:02:36.616 --> 01:02:40.617]  Mike Tyson would destroy him in 30 seconds.
[01:02:41.698 --> 01:02:42.838]  And you'd say, well that's cheating!
[01:02:43.398 --> 01:02:45.179]  He outweighs him by 100 pounds!
[01:02:45.719 --> 01:02:46.739]  Get him out of the ring!
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:49.740]  But then men,
[01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:57.693]  With shoulders way wider, and big muscles, and more blood mass, and testosterone, and a big old Johnson between her legs.
[01:02:58.373 --> 01:03:13.300]  They get out on that bicycle, they get out in that water for that swim race, they get out in that track race, they're now in football, and sprints, and everything, and dominate, and we go, hey, these women are being hateful, because they don't want to compete against other women.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.021]  It's all a mind game.
[01:03:15.061 --> 01:03:15.881]  It's all mind control.
[01:03:16.101 --> 01:03:17.442]  So what's the solution to this?
[01:03:20.422 --> 01:03:33.808]  Women and girls and families, if they put a so-called transgender person in your locker room, on the field with you, that's a fraud!
[01:03:34.108 --> 01:03:34.808]  Walk away!
[01:03:35.048 --> 01:03:36.129]  You have all the power!
[01:03:36.329 --> 01:03:37.990]  They're gonna ruin your sports anyways!
[01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.810]  They already are!
[01:03:40.034 --> 01:03:43.856]  Walk away from the whole sport.
[01:03:44.256 --> 01:03:45.477]  It's not real.
[01:03:45.497 --> 01:03:47.498]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:03:48.138 --> 01:03:49.719]  There are men and there are women.
[01:03:50.379 --> 01:03:57.043]  If somebody wants to have a sex change, somebody wants to gouge their eyeballs out because you got trans-abled now, that's your deal.
[01:03:57.163 --> 01:03:59.004]  I'm not paying for your lunatic asylum.
[01:03:59.244 --> 01:04:01.765]  I'm not paying for you when you're homeless on the side of the road.
[01:04:01.965 --> 01:04:03.286]  You want to go gouge your eyes out?
[01:04:03.446 --> 01:04:04.226]  Go starve to death.
[01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:05.167]  You're a mental patient.
[01:04:07.159 --> 01:04:13.377]  But this is all an assault by the diseased minds of San Francisco and Silicon Valley and the universities.
[01:04:13.718 --> 01:04:14.199]  And it's over.
[01:04:15.515 --> 01:04:21.276]  So, just like the NFL lost 40% of its viewers the last three years, bad-mouthing America, and all the rest of this crap, just keep it up!
[01:04:21.836 --> 01:04:23.737]  Because all these sports are ruined.
[01:04:24.037 --> 01:04:32.098]  Nobody's gonna put their daughter in there to go do swim practice every day, or go do track every day, and then have some dude show up and win every race.
[01:04:32.519 --> 01:04:33.379]  It's a fraud!
[01:04:34.119 --> 01:04:36.959]  Way beyond Mike Tyson in the ring with Floyd Waymether!
[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.160]  And everybody knows it!
[01:04:40.219 --> 01:04:49.828]  Hell, should I show up at Little League, you know, soccer game against eight-year-old girls and say, I'm an eight-year-old girl with a little bow in my hair, kicking girls aside, kicking goals every time?
[01:04:50.949 --> 01:04:52.230]  People would laugh.
[01:04:52.590 --> 01:04:54.692]  Fathers would walk over and kick my ass.
[01:04:55.172 --> 01:04:58.495]  But as long as it's liberal, it's okay to abuse our daughters.
[01:04:59.096 --> 01:05:00.217]  And the feminists love it.
[01:05:00.637 --> 01:05:01.258]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:03.274 --> 01:05:04.075]  We all know that.
[01:05:04.415 --> 01:05:09.359]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.402]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.
[01:05:12.422 --> 01:05:14.384]  This is the best deal we've ever offered.
[01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:16.286]  Free shipping storewide.
[01:05:16.606 --> 01:05:18.047]  That's free shipping storewide.
[01:05:18.488 --> 01:05:19.729]  Free shipping storewide.
[01:05:20.369 --> 01:05:21.769]  50% off all the supplements.
[01:05:21.889 --> 01:05:23.870]  A bunch of other great deals as well.
[01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:25.150]  Double Patriot points.
[01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:30.332]  Instead of 5% on each order, towards your next order you get 10% right there on your profile.
[01:05:30.832 --> 01:05:31.952]  Sign up for auto ship.

[01:06:03.905 --> 01:06:09.448]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:09.908 --> 01:06:11.229]  Because there is a war on.
[01:06:11.849 --> 01:06:12.750]  For your mind.
[01:06:44.634 --> 01:06:45.775]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:06:45.815 --> 01:06:47.956]  We're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:06:47.976 --> 01:06:48.537]  to 3 p.m.
[01:06:48.557 --> 01:06:48.917]  Central.
[01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:52.339]  Coming up tomorrow, we kick it off with David Nutt at 8 a.m.
[01:06:52.459 --> 01:06:55.001]  right through Saturday at 10 a.m.
[01:06:55.021 --> 01:07:03.306]  50-hour global transmission to hashtag stop the bias against conservatives, nationalists, Christians, conservatives, you name it.
[01:07:03.947 --> 01:07:07.309]  Classical liberals all being banned off the major platforms.
[01:07:07.329 --> 01:07:09.670]  Trump now says he may take action under pressure.
[01:07:10.331 --> 01:07:13.293]  It's a big banner at the top of Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:07:15.936 --> 01:07:19.259]  Defend the First Amendment, stop big tech censorship, stop the bias.
[01:07:19.279 --> 01:07:26.724]  We have a bunch of special guests, including Robert Barnes is going to be popping in, Tommy Robinson, Laura Loomer, and so many others.
[01:07:26.764 --> 01:07:28.726]  This is going to be a very special transmission.
[01:07:29.066 --> 01:07:35.991]  And when you get excited about it, a lot of these special transmissions we do outside of the main show get a couple hundred thousand viewers.
[01:07:36.772 --> 01:07:37.212]  That's great!
[01:07:37.272 --> 01:07:39.094]  That's a huge double sports stadium.
[01:07:40.131 --> 01:07:53.161]  But when you get excited and share the link to Infowars.com for its last show, when you tell folks, hey, the Forbidden is on and people are watching it and that chain reaction happens, we had a State of the Union.
[01:07:54.909 --> 01:08:00.090]  Well, Trump's first State of the Union, we had like 5 million people watch it that night and the streams throughout the evening.
[01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:04.611]  We had another off-year election thing, had about 4 million.
[01:08:05.231 --> 01:08:06.612]  And that's how we reach the new people.
[01:08:07.232 --> 01:08:08.492]  That's how we get past the censors.
[01:08:08.512 --> 01:08:09.972]  That's how we move the ball down the field.
[01:08:09.992 --> 01:08:11.193]  Because again, you're awake.
[01:08:11.293 --> 01:08:12.053]  You know what's going on.
[01:08:12.093 --> 01:08:13.973]  But we're reaching new people.
[01:08:14.593 --> 01:08:15.894]  This is an information war.
[01:08:16.354 --> 01:08:18.154]  And we're having big victories on a planetary scale.
[01:08:19.774 --> 01:08:21.635]  A lot of lawsuits are getting filed.
[01:08:22.734 --> 01:08:24.395]  Countering the left censorship and what's happening.
[01:08:24.415 --> 01:08:27.218]  But a lot of them, I think, I'm a lawyer, are going in the wrong direction.
[01:08:27.238 --> 01:08:32.962]  I think it's about collusion, racketeering, unfair trade practices, monopolistic things.
[01:08:32.982 --> 01:08:35.404]  They're always going into free speech or defamation.
[01:08:36.025 --> 01:08:41.730]  We'll talk to Robert Barnes, who's an established and respected lawyer, on these fronts here in just a moment.
[01:08:41.970 --> 01:08:44.912]  He also represents me and a lot of the matters we've got going.
[01:08:45.493 --> 01:08:49.056]  But I wanted to play President Trump responding to the whole witch hunt and the latest.
[01:08:49.096 --> 01:08:49.396]  Here it is.
[01:08:49.889 --> 01:08:51.472]  He gets appointed by a deputy.
[01:08:51.512 --> 01:08:52.394]  He writes a report.
[01:08:55.703 --> 01:08:56.824]  Never figured that one out.
[01:08:57.004 --> 01:08:58.765]  Man gets appointed by a deputy.
[01:08:58.785 --> 01:08:59.646]  He writes a report.
[01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:03.909]  I had the greatest electoral victory, one of them in the history of our country.
[01:09:05.069 --> 01:09:06.170]  Tremendous success.
[01:09:07.231 --> 01:09:08.612]  Tens of millions of voters.
[01:09:08.972 --> 01:09:10.633]  And now somebody's going to write a report.
[01:09:11.434 --> 01:09:12.234]  Who never got a vote.
[01:09:12.254 --> 01:09:13.615]  So we'll see what the report says.
[01:09:13.655 --> 01:09:14.556]  Let's see if it's fair.
[01:09:15.396 --> 01:09:17.098]  I have no idea when it's going to be released.
[01:09:17.398 --> 01:09:18.579]  Have you let others see it?
[01:09:18.619 --> 01:09:22.061]  Have you reversed your policy in Syria?
[01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.810]  No, no.
[01:09:23.850 --> 01:09:24.550]  We're in Syria.
[01:09:24.570 --> 01:09:32.752]  We're leaving 200 people there and 200 people in another place in Syria, closer to Israel, for a period of time.
[01:09:33.792 --> 01:09:39.733]  I brought this out for you because this is a map of everything in the red.
[01:09:39.773 --> 01:09:44.254]  This was on election night in 2016.
[01:09:44.414 --> 01:09:45.774]  Everything red is ISIS.
[01:09:46.755 --> 01:09:48.275]  When I took it over, it was a mess.
[01:09:49.195 --> 01:09:51.536]  Now, on the bottom, that's the exact same.
[01:09:52.036 --> 01:09:52.936]  There is no red.
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:58.521]  In fact, there's actually a tiny spot which will be gone by tonight.
[01:10:00.002 --> 01:10:02.382]  So that's ISIS, red, right there.
[01:10:04.383 --> 01:10:06.523]  And the bottom one is how it is today.
[01:10:06.543 --> 01:10:09.224]  This just came out 20 minutes ago.
[01:10:09.884 --> 01:10:16.886]  So this is ISIS on election day, my election day, and this is ISIS now.
[01:10:18.667 --> 01:10:19.727]  So that's the way it goes.
[01:10:24.181 --> 01:10:26.783]  I want to play both those, those are both important points, both those statements.
[01:10:27.383 --> 01:10:28.164]  Think about this.
[01:10:29.345 --> 01:10:39.893]  I've been begging Trump since he got elected to do weekly fireside chats, literally in the Oval Office, like Roosevelt did, but with a fire going.
[01:10:41.114 --> 01:10:46.398]  He talks about 30 minutes, shows some graphs like Ross Perot, people love that, and then he has a guest.
[01:10:48.621 --> 01:10:52.363]  And maybe it's a veteran, maybe it's a farmer, maybe it's a member of Congress, maybe it's a Democrat.
[01:10:53.164 --> 01:10:56.326]  And it's just an hour-long program, commercial-free, once a week.
[01:10:56.426 --> 01:11:08.274]  He would dominate it with graphs, but instead of him out there with it overblown and, you know, the light not showing it because of the sun, he'd have it controlled with either a television set or with a PowerPoint he could do.
[01:11:09.094 --> 01:11:09.855]  That is the answer.
[01:11:10.315 --> 01:11:11.816]  Do it, for heaven's sakes!
[01:11:13.019 --> 01:11:16.503]  Everyone would tune in, it'd have 20 million viewers, 30 million viewers, live.
[01:11:16.523 --> 01:11:20.407]  It would have tens of millions after, and it would really change things.
[01:11:20.447 --> 01:11:24.291]  So, I've been telling the President, I've told him personally, use graphs.
[01:11:24.511 --> 01:11:25.533]  Do what Ross Perot did.
[01:11:25.833 --> 01:11:27.455]  That is the final equation for you.
[01:11:27.975 --> 01:11:29.496]  If you'll just do that.
[01:11:29.536 --> 01:11:35.941]  And by the way, I built the new studio so I could start doing special reports and graphs and presentations.
[01:11:35.981 --> 01:11:36.942]  And we're going to get around to that.
[01:11:36.962 --> 01:11:43.027]  It's just that they try to keep me off balance with the lawsuits and the attacks and the family stuff so that I'm not engaged in production.
[01:11:43.067 --> 01:11:45.429]  But we're still moving forward, thanks to all your prayers.
[01:11:48.686 --> 01:11:49.986]  Robert Barnes on with us.
[01:11:50.026 --> 01:11:56.808]  He's an established constitutional lawyer, free speech lawyer, but he's also a famous civil rights lawyer, and many other things.
[01:11:56.868 --> 01:12:01.269]  And he's the chief strategist as we fight the deep state and their attempts to shut us down.
[01:12:02.349 --> 01:12:06.010]  And those admissions, I wanted to get him on yesterday, but I was unable.
[01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:10.310]  But he's on with us today to talk about Nunes' $250 million lawsuit.
[01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:11.831]  And I know he's probably had a chance to look at that.
[01:12:11.991 --> 01:12:12.631]  I've read over it.
[01:12:13.567 --> 01:12:23.670]  And I'm going to reserve judgment on it, but I think we're going in the right direction, at least, where the left wants to launch all these anti-free speech things when they're a bunch of hypocrites, but they're in glass houses.
[01:12:24.231 --> 01:12:26.031]  And I think this is starting to change their minds.
[01:12:26.131 --> 01:12:33.133]  Barnes' lawsuits, other lawsuits with the Covington kids, and it's really starting to cause a debate there about the litigious nature of the left.
[01:12:33.173 --> 01:12:37.655]  But what is your first approximation of Nunes' big lawsuit against Twitter?
[01:12:38.991 --> 01:12:39.932]  I'm glad he's doing it.
[01:12:40.072 --> 01:12:42.453]  I wish he would have maybe done it maybe a year or two ago.
[01:12:43.334 --> 01:12:46.355]  And I wish that they would have done more when they were in control of the House.
[01:12:46.876 --> 01:12:53.279]  So I think those aspects, you know, but with that said, it's better to bring an action than not bring an action.
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.901]  And the fact that it's someone of his high profile,
[01:12:56.161 --> 01:12:56.361]  Yeah.
[01:13:13.095 --> 01:13:19.859]  It reinforces to everybody in Congress they need to change the laws, not allow special immunity for Big Tech.
[01:13:19.919 --> 01:13:28.944]  Big Tech has now proven, particularly in your case, in a way that it will not be honest and honorable in following its role purely as a platform.
[01:13:30.044 --> 01:13:33.046]  A platform is just like somebody who hosts a convention center venue.
[01:13:33.426 --> 01:13:40.130]  That's how they got special immunity because they said they were never going to be a publisher, never going to be censoring people, never going to be editing people.
[01:13:40.450 --> 01:13:44.673]  Jack at Twitter said, don't worry, we're going to be the free speech wing of the free speech party.
[01:13:45.133 --> 01:13:49.656]  Use that to get a contractual advantage and a competitive advantage at the time.
[01:13:49.976 --> 01:13:52.918]  And now that they have it, they're trying to monopolize it for the ideological left.
[01:13:52.998 --> 01:14:00.663]  And in particular, they're scared of the most powerful, most influential, most significant, independent political voices like those at InfoWars.
[01:14:00.943 --> 01:14:02.464]  And that's why you were the primary target.
[01:14:02.784 --> 01:14:05.486]  So your case proved we cannot trust big tech.
[01:14:05.766 --> 01:14:05.946]  I think?
[01:14:22.861 --> 01:14:23.221]  That's right.
[01:14:23.241 --> 01:14:27.304]  I'm not the expert lawyer like you, but reading over his statements and part of the suit I had time to read.
[01:14:27.324 --> 01:14:28.104]  I couldn't read the whole thing.
[01:14:28.865 --> 01:14:32.427]  He's saying, you don't give us access to counter, then you let them attack.
[01:14:32.447 --> 01:14:35.589]  And then you let them attack my mother, my family, and tell these lies.
[01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:39.931]  While you're saying that you're this open and free group, which you're not, I'm going to get Discovery.
[01:14:40.352 --> 01:14:41.212]  I'm going to show what you're doing.
[01:14:41.392 --> 01:14:45.435]  Discovery, we have Project Veritas and all these undercover videos of Twitter, Facebook, Google.
[01:14:45.755 --> 01:14:49.417]  We have their head people at events saying we're going to shut down Alex Jones.
[01:14:49.557 --> 01:14:51.779]  There's a new video out of Kara Swisher.
[01:14:53.007 --> 01:14:57.670]  You know, he's married to Megan Smith, who runs the whole internet situation, and set this up.
[01:14:57.730 --> 01:15:04.095]  Third Chief Technology Officer of the United States saying, we called for Jones and took him down, now we want Ben Shapiro.
[01:15:04.395 --> 01:15:11.600]  These people admit they're involved in a jihad to take people down, and then later tell Congress, like Sergeant Shultz, I know nothing!
[01:15:11.781 --> 01:15:12.101]  Nothing!
[01:15:13.715 --> 01:15:14.195]  Precisely.
[01:15:14.455 --> 01:15:16.236]  So there's clearly a coordinated campaign.
[01:15:16.317 --> 01:15:17.077]  Everybody knows it.
[01:15:17.097 --> 01:15:18.358]  Everybody recognizes it.
[01:15:18.698 --> 01:15:26.562]  The Joe Rogan podcast that had Tim Pool on it and Jack from Twitter and their Twitter's lawyer couldn't answer basic questions.
[01:15:26.622 --> 01:15:28.784]  Couldn't explain basic pieces of information.
[01:15:29.084 --> 01:15:31.165]  Came up with storylines that just don't fit.
[01:15:31.585 --> 01:15:35.427]  Anybody that's on Twitter has seen some of the extreme actions the left has taken.
[01:15:35.768 --> 01:15:41.851]  And as an example, Twitter and the other social media giants have been used to facilitate terrorist events by ISIS.
[01:15:42.335 --> 01:15:49.083]  They're excused for why they had no responsibility whatsoever, like recently when Facebook refused to take down... You have to look at it in the context.
[01:15:50.024 --> 01:15:50.705]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:50.925 --> 01:15:58.353]  And they were saying, hey... I want to ask you where you think this is going, you're a smart fella, and why Trump isn't taking action, and what you think Trump should do.
[01:15:58.433 --> 01:15:59.695]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:16:04.628 --> 01:16:14.057]  We're going to do, this Thursday through Friday through Saturday, a 50-hour emergency Save the First Amendment broadcast with a bunch of special guests and a bunch of stuff we've never done before.
[01:16:14.178 --> 01:16:15.319]  Believe me, this is going to be special.
[01:16:15.419 --> 01:16:16.280]  Thursday 8 a.m.
[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:19.883]  with David Knight, right through Saturday 10 a.m., 50 hours, a bunch of special guests.
[01:16:20.003 --> 01:16:25.949]  We're going to blur out the violence, but we're going to look at all the anomalies, not even saying there's anomalies.
[01:16:26.170 --> 01:16:27.371]  We have a right to.
[01:16:27.711 --> 01:16:28.251]  Bill Johnson?
[01:16:28.411 --> 01:16:29.772]  No, I completely agree with you.
[01:16:30.092 --> 01:16:33.514]  And it should be done because the liberal media, they're not going to show any of that.
[01:16:33.554 --> 01:16:34.715]  They're not going to talk about that.
[01:16:34.855 --> 01:16:38.637]  They want to push this narrative again that it's white supremacy.
[01:16:38.658 --> 01:16:43.520]  And even when you read through all the information, he doesn't look like he's a white supremacy.
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:45.442]  He's completely for the Green Deal.
[01:16:45.542 --> 01:16:51.085]  He's against President Trump, but yet you have the media, even Fox News, pushing that he's a white supremacist.
[01:16:51.145 --> 01:16:51.385]  Why?
[01:16:51.545 --> 01:16:54.427]  Because all racist roads lead to white people.
[01:16:54.927 --> 01:16:55.908]  I mean, it's sickening.
[01:16:56.228 --> 01:17:00.990]  The truth is, governments do do stuff like this, and it's legitimate for anybody to ask those type of questions.
[01:17:03.451 --> 01:17:10.134]  It's been months and months and months since we've been able to have store-wide free shipping at Forrestore.com.
[01:17:10.734 --> 01:17:17.217]  And it's been months and months since we were able to offer 50% off on our best-selling products, because many of them
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:19.723]  Sold out at the end of the year.
[01:17:20.625 --> 01:17:23.791]  We've gotten almost all of our best-selling products back in stock.
[01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:28.940]  And so now, for the second half of the month of March, we're going to be able to offer
[01:17:30.672 --> 01:17:35.897]  50% off all our best-selling products at fullwarslife.com, all the supplements.
[01:17:35.957 --> 01:17:40.542]  And 50% off on many other products on the site as well, and the store-wide free shipping.
[01:17:40.663 --> 01:17:49.933]  And what's even more exciting about this is, as I told you over a year ago, we can no longer get the deep earth crystals to produce the X2 formula.
[01:17:50.859 --> 01:17:57.444]  We were able to get another form of crystals that were just as good, but it still isn't the exact same formula because it's not the exact same type.
[01:17:58.244 --> 01:18:01.627]  That's X3, all three different types, triiodine, it's excellent.
[01:18:01.807 --> 01:18:02.828]  We have that, people love it.
[01:18:03.408 --> 01:18:15.917]  But I was able to get the exact same system, the exact same crystals, the exact same formula from the original manufacturer of our iodine, and we now have the purest, cleanest halogen out there.
[01:18:16.137 --> 01:18:20.280]  The good halogen versus the bad halogens of fluoride and chlorine and all the rest of them.
[01:18:20.922 --> 01:18:41.205]  So, InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com now has store-wide free shipping and 50% off RainForce Plus, 50% off Survival Shield X2, 50% off Super Metal Vitality, 50% off Bodies, 50% off Alpha Power, 50% off Super Blue Products, 50% off DNA Force, 50% off Knockout.
[01:18:42.246 --> 01:18:53.755]  50% off Vitamin Monroe Fusion, and then again, all the other products are between 40 and 25% off, because some of the products don't have 40 or 50% you can cut off, because then you're actually losing money.
[01:18:54.295 --> 01:18:58.358]  In fact, when you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional 10% off on the next order.
[01:18:58.759 --> 01:19:01.621]  You can cancel any time for free with one click on your profile.
[01:19:01.881 --> 01:19:03.722]  These become lost leaders, many of them.
[01:19:03.762 --> 01:19:05.003]  And then, oh, I almost forgot.
[01:19:05.144 --> 01:19:06.725]  Double Patriot Points.
[01:19:07.466 --> 01:19:08.951]  We're good to go.
[01:19:15.257 --> 01:19:16.618]  It's 10 cents on every dollar.
[01:19:16.898 --> 01:19:25.302]  So you add that to store-wide free shipping, you add that to 50% off, you add that to 10% off on auto ship, and then 10% off credit towards your next order.
[01:19:25.482 --> 01:19:26.482]  That's just insane.
[01:19:26.562 --> 01:19:29.964]  So this is the biggest sale we've ever done.
[01:19:30.044 --> 01:19:39.048]  It matches the sales we did year-end to clear out inventory in case the globals were able to take away our final financial processing systems.
[01:19:39.548 --> 01:19:40.649]  But now we've got backups.
[01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:41.690]  Thanks to your prayers.
[01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:43.332]  Thanks for the support.
[01:19:43.412 --> 01:19:47.477]  And thanks to the fact this country still has basic redundancy against the tyrants.
[01:19:47.777 --> 01:19:49.799]  But we are fighting for our very existence.
[01:19:50.079 --> 01:19:53.663]  So help fund the Tibetan Sphere and get great products at the same time.
[01:19:53.703 --> 01:19:55.005]  A 360 win at infowarestore.com.
[01:19:55.045 --> 01:19:56.406]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:19:56.907 --> 01:19:57.928]  Double patriot points.
[01:19:58.489 --> 01:19:59.309]  And so much more.
[01:19:59.590 --> 01:20:00.571]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:20:06.394 --> 01:20:09.096]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:38.277]  But then Twitter, Facebook, Google, they all work with Pakistan, you name it, to round up political dissidents and execute them.
[01:20:38.597 --> 01:20:47.127]  They help China, especially Google and Apple, surveil their own people and restrict even the president of Taiwan, saying they exist.
[01:20:48.112 --> 01:20:56.896]  And so now they've gone from, oh, Alex Jones violated our rules, to just, no, we don't want him or anybody like him on the platforms anymore.
[01:20:57.616 --> 01:21:03.439]  And, you know, Nunes and others should have, as you said, taken action two years ago when they had all the cards, the trifecta.
[01:21:04.979 --> 01:21:06.220]  What do you think Trump should do?
[01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:11.782]  Because he's put out some emails, he's put out some tweets saying, hashtag stop the bias.
[01:21:11.802 --> 01:21:12.462]  That's Laura Loomer.
[01:21:12.482 --> 01:21:13.243]  She's on next hour.
[01:21:14.454 --> 01:21:16.756]  And he said, OK, we may have to do something now.
[01:21:17.096 --> 01:21:20.579]  Well, just a week and a half ago, he said, well, this is just how it is.
[01:21:20.599 --> 01:21:23.502]  You have to behave yourself better than the Democrats or you'll get banned.
[01:21:23.862 --> 01:21:25.343]  Well, now they want Ben Shapiro banned.
[01:21:25.403 --> 01:21:26.564]  Now they've demonetized him.
[01:21:27.065 --> 01:21:29.066]  I mean, I mean, they're doing this to everybody.
[01:21:30.107 --> 01:21:37.015]  Even though Ben Shapiro's a never-Trumper, don't they understand that when you let censorship happen, it always becomes a total takeover?
[01:21:37.255 --> 01:21:45.304]  And then whoever is in power basically almost always nepotistically puts their kids or their girlfriend, you know, in charge of positions.
[01:21:45.584 --> 01:21:49.849]  When you let people control the public discourse, they're always going to dominate it and abuse it.
[01:21:51.534 --> 01:21:52.014]  Precisely.
[01:21:52.335 --> 01:21:55.116]  And so particularly here, he's on the right course strategically.
[01:21:55.356 --> 01:21:59.779]  He just needs to take official action and remind himself that he's the President of the United States.
[01:22:00.219 --> 01:22:08.664]  So he recently tweeted out about Saturday Night Live about how really aren't they sort of violating election laws given they're using the public airwaves to propagandize for a particular party.
[01:22:09.145 --> 01:22:15.308]  Well, that's precisely what Big Tech is doing at a much more frightening scale than a late-night comedy show that has diminishing ratings.
[01:22:15.789 --> 01:22:17.810]  So what he needs to do is appoint a special counsel
[01:22:18.402 --> 01:22:28.494]  Appoint someone who's a lefty free speech person to that position and have them do a full scale, wholesale investigation of Big Tech as to whether or not Big Tech is manipulating elections.
[01:22:28.854 --> 01:22:30.937]  Look at the Alabama 2017 election.
[01:22:31.197 --> 01:22:34.000]  Look at the 2018 midterm elections.
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:39.086]  Look at what they're doing in terms of manipulate because when they are censoring voices, selectively censoring voices,
[01:22:39.386 --> 01:22:47.109]  With a partisan and political agenda, arguably they're making an in-kind campaign donation to the Democratic Party that's unreported and undisclosed.
[01:22:47.469 --> 01:22:57.833]  So what should happen is use their political bias, where their political bias is most legally problematic, is in the way it impacts elections and public speech for a particular partisan end, and go after them.
[01:22:57.853 --> 01:23:08.357]  And what you should do is combine it with going after those fake charities like Southern Poverty Law Center that just had to fire its boss because of its history of problematic behavior.
[01:23:08.797 --> 01:23:15.982]  That are in cahoots and colluding with the big tech giants to politically and socially censor their ideological adversaries.
[01:23:16.342 --> 01:23:20.885]  And if he takes that step, then Big Tech will learn they better behave better.
[01:23:21.105 --> 01:23:24.888]  Because if they don't, they won't be able to manipulate the 2020 election like they plan on doing.
[01:23:25.408 --> 01:23:30.872]  And they're going to have to start reconsidering all of their options and how they strategically... Just go back to being a platform.
[01:23:31.192 --> 01:23:32.333]  No longer be a publisher.
[01:23:32.613 --> 01:23:34.214]  No longer claim censoring controls.
[01:23:34.274 --> 01:23:35.975]  No longer claim editorial controls.
[01:23:36.335 --> 01:23:37.276]  No longer do any of that.
[01:23:37.556 --> 01:23:40.258]  Impose the First Amendment rights as part of their terms of service.
[01:23:40.278 --> 01:23:41.298]  And by the way, let me raise that.
[01:23:41.418 --> 01:23:43.480]  Because the New York Times said, oh, this will go nowhere.
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:44.080]  They have Section 230.
[01:23:45.081 --> 01:23:47.042]  But Twitter and others have abandoned Section 230.
[01:23:47.442 --> 01:23:48.843]  So I'm not saying get rid of 230.
[01:23:48.883 --> 01:23:49.503]  It's a great thing.
[01:23:49.523 --> 01:23:50.564]  I don't think you are.
[01:23:50.644 --> 01:23:56.968]  But you can't jump back and forth and basically say it exists, but it doesn't exist.
[01:23:57.248 --> 01:23:59.850]  So I think if we go after 230, they're going to have to sue for peace.
[01:24:01.365 --> 01:24:01.745]  Precisely.
[01:24:01.765 --> 01:24:07.469]  I mean, the goal is Section 230 should be reinterpreted and reconstrued to be consistent with First Amendment principles.
[01:24:07.849 --> 01:24:11.752]  So that it, or if it, very simple, if they want to be a publisher, they have two choices.
[01:24:12.092 --> 01:24:20.078]  Either stay a platform, don't become a publisher, and in that instance, you can keep Section 230 immunity entirely, like most tech sites that are out there.
[01:24:20.638 --> 01:24:27.923]  Or, if you want to have the privileges of a publisher, then you have the obligations of the First Amendment once you reach a monopoly size square.
[01:24:28.503 --> 01:24:35.946]  My view is that I don't have a problem with small publishers that have tech platforms choosing who they want to have on there.
[01:24:36.266 --> 01:24:38.867]  The problem is when somebody reaches monopoly power.
[01:24:39.207 --> 01:24:50.411]  When they have more than 75 to 80 percent... Yeah, when Google's got 93 percent of global searches and they're fixing results and lying to Congress about it while putting out prospectus reports admitting they're fixing results.
[01:24:51.508 --> 01:24:51.948]  Precisely.
[01:24:52.228 --> 01:24:54.789]  So, I mean, the old doctrine used to be established here in the U.S.
[01:24:54.809 --> 01:24:59.970]  Supreme Court, determined many years ago, and California has expanded it into what's called the Pruneyard Doctrine.
[01:25:00.270 --> 01:25:16.694]  But the point is that if you are a private company and you have the privilege of a public monopoly because of something, whether it's an immunity law, whether it's the way it sort of evolved technologically or for other reasons, like the company towns that used to run the coal mining towns and throughout the small parts of the South and the Appalachia,
[01:25:17.134 --> 01:25:23.720]  If you achieve that power, then you are accepting the obligations of the First Amendment as it applies to the public square.
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.282]  Or you can simply forfeit that monopoly power.
[01:25:26.342 --> 01:25:28.924]  Nobody requires you to be a monopoly over the public square.
[01:25:29.284 --> 01:25:37.791]  But once you choose to be a monopoly over a public square, then you need to abide by First Amendment standards if you want to continue to have Section 230 immunity.
[01:25:38.172 --> 01:25:42.275]  And that's a simple legal solution for them to have, and it's the legal solution they'll reach
[01:25:42.755 --> 01:25:56.126]  If they realize the President of the United States is going to start having a special counsel that's even on the left, so they can't even claim it's partisan, but simply someone committed to free speech, committed to the public square, committed to public debate, committed to free and open elections.
[01:25:56.406 --> 01:25:57.767]  And that's what's at risk.
[01:25:57.867 --> 01:25:59.228]  That's what's being threatened here.
[01:26:00.609 --> 01:26:09.156]  If Trump doesn't get ahead of this, if Trump doesn't have institutional, the big tech knowing that they're being watched and monitored and surveilled like they watch and monitor and surveil the rest.
[01:26:09.176 --> 01:26:10.657]  He's totally green lighting even worse
[01:26:10.757 --> 01:26:11.318]  That's crazy.
[01:26:32.447 --> 01:26:33.689]  I've never seen people in their houses.
[01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:42.079]  I mean, at a certain point, what do I do when they're saying I'm saying things, and then they're speaking for me?
[01:26:42.099 --> 01:26:43.160]  I mean, it's next level.
[01:26:43.401 --> 01:26:48.026]  They're saying it's this big, suable, evil offense, and then they're the ones saying it, but saying I said it.
[01:26:48.307 --> 01:26:49.188]  What do I do about that?
[01:26:50.512 --> 01:26:54.854]  I mean, at some point, I think what's happening is you have a lot of institutional members of the big press.
[01:26:55.314 --> 01:27:06.240]  You have people that are connected to them within the so-called journalistic community, who simply want to use the legal system, use lawfare, to achieve what big tech is doing.
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:07.781]  Shut down, silent,
[01:27:08.061 --> 01:27:10.182]  Dissident, independent, small press voices.
[01:27:10.582 --> 01:27:13.783]  So the freedom of the press is there to protect the little guy, not the big guy.
[01:27:13.803 --> 01:27:15.783]  The New York Times doesn't need any special protection.
[01:27:16.183 --> 01:27:18.224]  It's the independent citizen journalist.
[01:27:18.584 --> 01:27:25.106]  It's the independent, dissident, free-minded, free press that is who the First Amendment is all about protecting.
[01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:31.168]  And they're using lawfare in a discriminant and disparate way to target particular political adversaries
[01:27:31.636 --> 01:27:31.856]  I don't
[01:27:54.344 --> 01:27:56.725]  Now they've opened themselves up by their own yardstick.
[01:27:57.045 --> 01:28:01.526]  They're going to be in way more trouble than I am, because they've actually done the things that you say they've done.
[01:28:02.747 --> 01:28:03.287]  Oh, precisely.
[01:28:03.327 --> 01:28:08.688]  I mean, unlike the cases against you, in the Covington case, they specifically identified individuals.
[01:28:08.728 --> 01:28:10.649]  They specifically went after those individuals.
[01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:14.190]  Kathy Griffin said, please name them, please shame them, please dox them.
[01:28:14.810 --> 01:28:17.411]  People called for them to be physically assaulted and attacked.
[01:28:17.831 --> 01:28:25.278]  The false accusations, none of that is even effectively accused in the Sandy Hook related cases.
[01:28:25.438 --> 01:28:27.420]  So you see a major gap between the two.
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:36.928]  You see defamation law being used in a discriminant and disparate way against dissident voices for things that do not constitute defamation as a matter of law under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
[01:28:37.308 --> 01:28:37.468]  Hi, I'm
[01:29:04.938 --> 01:29:12.324]  There's been a paradox or a contradiction on the surface that many have noted in the last hundred years.
[01:29:13.425 --> 01:29:20.270]  Historians are confused by the fact that powerful British and European and U.S.
[01:29:20.530 --> 01:29:30.098]  robber barons of the 19th and 20th century almost to a man funded socialism and communism.
[01:29:30.862 --> 01:29:32.103]  People say that doesn't make sense.
[01:29:32.843 --> 01:29:40.108]  But Carol Quigley, the head of Georgetown Political Science, Bill Clinton's mentor back in the 1960s, wrote Tragedy and Hope.
[01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:50.474]  And in the 1100 page blueprint, he explains that we want fascism, we want communism, we want socialism, we want command and control.
[01:29:51.135 --> 01:29:55.517]  But our favorite system is socialism because it domesticates the people.
[01:29:55.897 --> 01:29:57.939]  But we want to have the illusion of left and right.
[01:29:57.959 --> 01:29:59.480]  We want to control both parties.
[01:30:00.663 --> 01:30:05.829]  So the people think they're having change, but really they move in the same direction towards vertical integration.
[01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:12.257]  So you have the big billionaires, the people controlling trillion dollar companies like Tim Cook and Apple and others.
[01:30:13.632 --> 01:30:27.843]  Who literally run the equivalent of slave factories in China, who help round up political dissidents, but they're everywhere lecturing you about Black Lives Matter and about how Trump hates Muslims and how altruistic and loving they are.
[01:30:28.644 --> 01:30:32.787]  Because if you look into what they pay in taxes, it's almost zero.
[01:30:33.268 --> 01:30:40.694]  And it's all the big tech companies have set it up with offshore accounts and other systems where they legally pay almost no tax.
[01:30:41.778 --> 01:30:49.041]  And the very same people lecture you and I, how if you're making $100,000 a year, you're rich and you're not paying enough money.
[01:30:49.061 --> 01:30:51.462]  If you're making $200,000 a year, you're in the 1%.
[01:30:51.602 --> 01:30:54.203]  And you're guilty and you're bad.
[01:30:55.743 --> 01:31:02.546]  No, the globalists are in the .0000000042, depending on the analysis you do.
[01:31:04.466 --> 01:31:08.728]  That tiny percentage of a percentage controls over half the wealth.
[01:31:10.126 --> 01:31:12.368]  And they're maneuvering things towards a monopoly.
[01:31:12.408 --> 01:31:13.989]  They want to get rid of middle classes.
[01:31:14.029 --> 01:31:24.137]  They want to get rid of real free market systems that threaten them with innovation and new companies and new ideas and new leaders and new savants that come along.
[01:31:25.174 --> 01:31:32.636]  So they're creating a classical system, a two-tiered system, where the elite are on top, the people are on the bottom, and there's no middle class.
[01:31:33.216 --> 01:31:43.400]  That's the globalist aim, selling you on austerity, selling you on being poor, telling you your carbon footprint's evil, but AOC and the rest of them fly around on private jets and wear $3,000-plus outfits.
[01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:47.401]  All they tell us is capitalism is a failure.
[01:31:47.421 --> 01:31:49.163]  It isn't capitalism that's a failure.
[01:31:49.683 --> 01:31:59.649]  It's crony capitalism, using socialism and communism to control us, that is working beautifully for this world fascist system they've set up.
[01:32:00.189 --> 01:32:07.814]  It's corporate fascism using crony capitalism to dodge the taxes, to be above the law, diplomatic immunity, dominating humanity.
[01:32:08.354 --> 01:32:10.155]  And that's why they demonize info wars.
[01:32:10.676 --> 01:32:13.698]  If you read the Clinton Foundation documents, the Judicial Watch sued and died.
[01:32:15.559 --> 01:32:22.065]  They're talking in the early 90s about we can't let right-wingers or nationalists ever create their own economy.
[01:32:22.405 --> 01:32:27.530]  If they sell a book or have a magazine or open a company, we've got to say it's evil and shut it down.
[01:32:29.864 --> 01:32:30.904]  Let them have a community.
[01:32:30.944 --> 01:32:32.325]  We can't let them create their own economy.
[01:32:32.625 --> 01:32:36.747]  That's why when you go to infowarestore.com, you don't just get amazing products.
[01:32:37.347 --> 01:32:40.588]  You're funding the second American Revolution that's going worldwide.
[01:32:40.928 --> 01:32:43.489]  The very bane of the tyrants that you have a choice.
[01:32:44.130 --> 01:32:47.091]  We have store-wide 50% off right now, and we've got
[01:32:48.103 --> 01:32:50.424]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:35.348 --> 01:33:39.889]  We have made the attack on free speech, not just here, but worldwide, a central issue.
[01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:47.051]  And make no mistake, InfoWars and you, the audience, who are incredible activists, are driving that agenda.
[01:33:48.051 --> 01:33:49.151]  Not just here, but all the world.
[01:33:50.372 --> 01:33:51.472]  From Brazil to Australia.
[01:33:52.574 --> 01:33:56.755]  From Europe to the UK, from Canada to Washington, D.C.
[01:33:57.535 --> 01:33:58.516]  And that's because of you.
[01:33:59.196 --> 01:34:00.456]  And the president feels the heat.
[01:34:01.196 --> 01:34:04.317]  He's got all these advisers, though, that give him conflicting ideas and conflicting plans.
[01:34:04.357 --> 01:34:06.518]  It's very clear what needs to be done.
[01:34:06.538 --> 01:34:08.859]  These big tech companies have lied to Congress.
[01:34:09.819 --> 01:34:10.639]  They've been caught doing it.
[01:34:11.159 --> 01:34:11.959]  They've been colluding.
[01:34:11.979 --> 01:34:13.200]  They have monopoly status.
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:15.260]  They're involved in election meddling.
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:16.461]  Talk about the Russians.
[01:34:16.481 --> 01:34:17.341]  That's a red herring.
[01:34:18.058 --> 01:34:20.799]  A big tech Google executive the day Hillary lost.
[01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:24.041]  November 9th, they're saying, we won't let this happen again.
[01:34:24.061 --> 01:34:25.702]  On their own internal videos.
[01:34:26.482 --> 01:34:27.703]  And Trump's tweeted about that.
[01:34:27.923 --> 01:34:29.583]  So he knows we have them.
[01:34:30.384 --> 01:34:31.825]  With the hand in the cookie jar.
[01:34:31.845 --> 01:34:36.647]  It's like catching a bank robber walking out with bags of money and a mask on their face.
[01:34:36.707 --> 01:34:37.467]  I mean, you got them.
[01:34:39.148 --> 01:34:40.789]  But I wanted to mention this before we go back to Robert Barnes.
[01:34:42.269 --> 01:34:43.090]  Seven years ago,
[01:34:45.543 --> 01:35:00.970]  We had six and a half years ago, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, both newly elected senators, come out and say to the world, it's wrong to be Al Qaeda's air force in Syria.
[01:35:01.951 --> 01:35:06.593]  And Obama and Hillary were funding the Arab Spring and overthrowing our allies, putting radical Muslims in.
[01:35:08.214 --> 01:35:10.375]  And so the Pentagon went to Obama and said, we're not going to do this.
[01:35:11.115 --> 01:35:13.977]  So Assad made a deal that after ISIS and Al Qaeda,
[01:35:14.835 --> 01:35:18.056]  It was called Al-Qaeda then and they called it ISIS to confuse the public.
[01:35:18.536 --> 01:35:22.798]  When they were removed, they would then start the move towards having new elections and Assad would leave.
[01:35:23.058 --> 01:35:24.678]  Now we'll see if he follows the deal in the next year.
[01:35:26.319 --> 01:35:27.759]  But it was the Russians who the U.S.
[01:35:27.839 --> 01:35:30.240]  worked with, who went in, did 90% of the work.
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:32.961]  Now the Russians have pulled out because we agreed to go finish it.
[01:35:33.721 --> 01:35:38.642]  So when Trump takes credit for this, yes, Obama sent ISIS in with all those new Toyota trucks.
[01:35:38.923 --> 01:35:39.983]  He gave them all the U.S.
[01:35:40.023 --> 01:35:43.044]  bases in western Iraq.
[01:35:44.332 --> 01:35:45.912]  John McCain quarterbacked the whole thing.
[01:35:46.153 --> 01:35:46.773]  To invade.
[01:35:46.813 --> 01:35:48.133]  That's why they were all left alone.
[01:35:48.153 --> 01:35:49.273]  Like, here's Al-Qaeda.
[01:35:49.293 --> 01:35:50.854]  Remember, it wasn't ISIS when they invaded.
[01:35:50.874 --> 01:35:51.454]  It was Al-Qaeda.
[01:35:52.134 --> 01:35:52.675]  Six years ago.
[01:35:53.755 --> 01:35:56.356]  And all these thousands of trucks and these convoys.
[01:35:56.376 --> 01:35:56.776]  Remember those?
[01:35:56.816 --> 01:35:57.096]  Pull up.
[01:35:57.416 --> 01:35:59.417]  ISIS convoys entering Syria.
[01:35:59.897 --> 01:36:00.457]  Six years ago.
[01:36:01.277 --> 01:36:02.377]  Like, why don't we bomb them?
[01:36:02.397 --> 01:36:03.378]  Where are the Predator drones?
[01:36:03.398 --> 01:36:07.339]  I mean, that whole place is militarized because it was Obama's invasion force.
[01:36:09.249 --> 01:36:11.770]  So yeah, the Russians came in, kicked them out of the major cities.
[01:36:12.090 --> 01:36:12.510]  The U.S.
[01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:13.511]  came in and mopped it up.
[01:36:14.051 --> 01:36:18.212]  We said to Russia, we'll have a full-scale invasion if you act like you're going to take it over.
[01:36:18.553 --> 01:36:22.554]  So as soon as it looks like you've beaten them, we'll come in and finish the mop-up and then we'll pull out.
[01:36:23.034 --> 01:36:24.715]  And then Trump did what he said he would do.
[01:36:26.476 --> 01:36:28.436]  And the neocons flipped out.
[01:36:30.777 --> 01:36:32.198]  So, that's what happened.
[01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:42.816]  And now the last little enclave is pinned up against a riverbank, and the President's come out with this map showing all this, but let's give credit where credit's due.
[01:36:42.856 --> 01:36:48.580]  The evil demon Russians came in and did this, and then our military finished it.
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:56.346]  But notice Russia's getting no thanks for this, because you can't, because you're a Russian agent, if you thank Russia for standing up against radical Islam.
[01:36:56.646 --> 01:36:59.668]  So here's the President speaking about it just minutes ago.
[01:37:01.229 --> 01:37:02.630]  This was on election night.
[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:07.261]  In 2016, everything red is ISIS.
[01:37:08.221 --> 01:37:09.762]  When I took it over, it was a mess.
[01:37:10.682 --> 01:37:12.983]  Now, on the bottom, that's the exact same.
[01:37:13.503 --> 01:37:14.444]  There is no red.
[01:37:15.924 --> 01:37:19.986]  In fact, there's actually a tiny spot which will be gone by tonight.
[01:37:21.052 --> 01:37:29.255]  President Trump touting progress against the Islamic State a short time ago, and the ISIS making its last stand in Syria.
[01:37:29.695 --> 01:37:38.758]  Fox News learning that U.S.-backed forces are set to seize one of the last ISIS encampments, and ISIS fighters are pinned on a riverbank in a last-ditch effort to hold territory.
[01:37:39.159 --> 01:37:42.080]  Our Benjamin Hall is live on the ground inside Syria.
[01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:42.780]  Benjamin?
[01:37:46.209 --> 01:37:52.637]  Yeah, hi Harris, and we are now just waiting for that final announcement that the offensive against the Caliphate is done.
[01:37:52.717 --> 01:37:57.404]  But no one wants to guess at exactly when that might be, and that's because it has been delayed and delayed a number of times.
[01:37:57.624 --> 01:37:58.946]  ISIS have been resilient.
[01:37:59.346 --> 01:38:01.689]  Today we were back inside that village of Barhoz.
[01:38:02.170 --> 01:38:02.791]  Hear what we saw.
[01:38:05.765 --> 01:38:09.991]  We are the only news team to have come this far forward into this part of the village.
[01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:17.742]  The fact is, although the SDF have recaptured this area, it is still believed to be littered with booby traps and IEDs.
[01:38:18.242 --> 01:38:21.367]  That may take months, if not years, to clear.
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:26.481]  The fighters here are battle-hardened and they're battle-weary.
[01:38:26.501 --> 01:38:31.722]  And even though there may be a very short time left until the caliphate is gone, the sense is there won't be much celebration.
[01:38:31.762 --> 01:38:32.722]  The losses have been immense.
[01:38:32.742 --> 01:38:36.043]  Let's stop right there and go back to our guest, because I want to get back into the First Amendment and where this is going.
[01:38:36.083 --> 01:38:37.883]  But that's what really happened.
[01:38:37.904 --> 01:38:39.404]  It's not debatable what I just said.
[01:38:39.464 --> 01:38:40.124]  That's the facts.
[01:38:41.044 --> 01:38:43.485]  And the West let these people in.
[01:38:44.491 --> 01:38:46.812]  And then our military said this is really immoral and said no.
[01:38:47.192 --> 01:38:48.653]  And then Trump and the Russians finished it.
[01:38:49.413 --> 01:38:58.276]  So it's like you're watching a football game and a wide receiver catches 15 passes, makes 5 touchdowns, and you give all the credit to the quarterback.
[01:39:00.217 --> 01:39:03.698]  But the Russians are like the wide receiver and the offensive line.
[01:39:03.938 --> 01:39:05.459]  I mean, they did most of the work.
[01:39:06.159 --> 01:39:12.942]  And it's just evil to sit here and not say that we didn't have an alliance with Russia and we didn't do a good thing with Russia.
[01:39:13.783 --> 01:39:15.164]  Well, there's really an integration
[01:39:34.935 --> 01:39:52.649]  So the reality of what happened in Syria, as to whether certain chemical weapons attacks did or didn't happen, as to Russia's participation and contribution to the end of one of the most dangerous threats and regimes in world history in terms of what ISIS was capable of doing and wanted to do.
[01:39:53.069 --> 01:40:00.815]  And one important point, ISIS's entire political predicate is that they control property, that they control land, that they have sovereign control over it.
[01:40:00.875 --> 01:40:01.856]  It's an Islamic state!
[01:40:02.156 --> 01:40:02.997]  A state needs land.
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:04.340]  Exactly.
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:12.665]  They believe, from their interpretation of their Islamic tradition, that if they don't have land they have sovereign control over, they no longer exist and no longer matter.
[01:40:12.905 --> 01:40:15.366]  So that's why it was critical and essential to deprive them of that.
[01:40:15.646 --> 01:40:20.449]  Their entire appeal was, unlike al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups... They have their own manifest destiny.
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:21.740]  Exactly.
[01:40:21.981 --> 01:40:23.722]  And if they don't have the land, they're gone.
[01:40:23.782 --> 01:40:24.223]  They're done.
[01:40:24.263 --> 01:40:24.823]  They're finished.
[01:40:24.963 --> 01:40:25.303]  Period.
[01:40:25.664 --> 01:40:26.985]  So that was critical.
[01:40:27.025 --> 01:40:41.057]  But where there's an overlap is if you look at how big tech is trying to control and censor the news, and you look at how the goal and objectives such as the cases against you, the efforts to completely censor you, to completely remove you from any platform people can see you,
[01:40:41.798 --> 01:40:43.918]  Is if you go back to the first Iraqi war.
[01:40:44.339 --> 01:40:47.199]  So they want only the government approved narrative to come out.
[01:40:47.619 --> 01:40:52.460]  Almost all major wars have been waged based on various public traumas that have occurred.
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:55.121]  Some whether they whether they did occur or they didn't occur.
[01:40:55.441 --> 01:40:57.461]  Others where somebody else may have been the culprit.
[01:40:57.761 --> 01:41:02.102]  And the goal of the state is to make sure nobody questions that public trauma.
[01:41:02.642 --> 01:41:07.203]  And the so for example in the case of the incubator baby story from the first Iraq war.
[01:41:08.234 --> 01:41:19.497]  If cases like the Sandy Hook case go forward, if the tech censorship succeeds as it is attempting to here against you, who is going to raise the questions about whether the incubator baby story is true?
[01:41:19.837 --> 01:41:23.297]  Who's going to raise questions about whether weapons of mass destruction are actually there?
[01:41:23.638 --> 01:41:34.260]  Who's going to raise questions about whether the government's premise and predicate for going to war and killing hundreds of thousands, millions of people, and destabilizing wars and regimes and societies for decades,
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:44.127]  Who is going to ask those questions if they have no access to tech platforms and if they can be sued into oblivion for raising questions and challenging government narratives?
[01:41:44.487 --> 01:41:46.689]  That's where the two stories come together in the end.
[01:41:47.049 --> 01:41:54.875]  The government's goal and the big tech's goal and the institutional goals of the institutional actors is to only allow special approved messages to come out.
[01:41:55.175 --> 01:41:57.217]  If it's from the New York Times, then it's okay.
[01:41:57.457 --> 01:42:00.860]  If it's from anyone else, they should be shamed, censored and sued into oblivion.
[01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:02.741]  That's where the two strategies overlap.
[01:42:03.422 --> 01:42:16.778]  The best resistance to illegal wars, the best resistance to unlawful activity, the best resistance to misrepresentations of what's happening overseas has always been the small independent press, never the big institutional press.
[01:42:16.898 --> 01:42:19.461]  And that's where it always starts, because I didn't even say that...
[01:42:21.408 --> 01:42:22.569]  New church crisis.
[01:42:22.629 --> 01:42:24.992]  Christchurch out in New Zealand didn't happen.
[01:42:25.352 --> 01:42:26.193]  I believe the guy did it.
[01:42:26.233 --> 01:42:26.994]  I believe he's a monster.
[01:42:27.014 --> 01:42:29.477]  But a lot of it, in his own writings, he says he's a leftist.
[01:42:30.078 --> 01:42:31.419]  And Rush Limbaugh said the same thing.
[01:42:31.859 --> 01:42:34.342]  He said, well, is he doing this to blame right-wingers?
[01:42:34.382 --> 01:42:36.084]  He says he's doing it to cause a race war.
[01:42:36.484 --> 01:42:41.430]  So that really is a type of false flag when you're doing something to cause a larger event as a trigger event.
[01:42:41.770 --> 01:42:45.554]  That fits in historically, and I know you as a scholar can speak to that.
[01:42:45.594 --> 01:42:49.518]  We come back just briefly then, because they said, oh, take Jones off the web, see?
[01:42:49.838 --> 01:42:51.140]  He's saying it didn't happen again.
[01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:54.383]  Well, I didn't say that, but I have a right to say that if I did.
[01:42:54.403 --> 01:43:00.169]  So they act like it's the most dirty thing in the world to question any big provocation event.
[01:43:02.831 --> 01:43:05.832]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[01:43:06.192 --> 01:43:12.115]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[01:43:12.535 --> 01:43:18.418]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[01:43:18.718 --> 01:43:21.339]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[01:43:21.639 --> 01:43:29.147]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[01:43:29.167 --> 01:43:37.376]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[01:43:37.977 --> 01:43:42.242]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[01:43:43.081 --> 01:43:46.702]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[01:43:46.902 --> 01:43:52.865]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[01:43:53.825 --> 01:44:02.708]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[01:44:03.229 --> 01:44:07.690]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[01:44:08.170 --> 01:44:09.211]  You're probably going, wait a minute.
[01:44:10.285 --> 01:44:12.135]  For the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[01:44:12.155 --> 01:44:13.421]  It was the last run.
[01:44:13.441 --> 01:44:14.386]  It's been sold out for two months.
[01:44:15.472 --> 01:44:16.333]  How is X2 back?
[01:44:16.833 --> 01:44:20.435]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[01:44:20.896 --> 01:44:23.978]  We got put over the barrel, some industrial sabotage, we couldn't get it anymore.
[01:44:24.578 --> 01:44:34.605]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[01:44:34.685 --> 01:44:38.608]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[01:44:39.028 --> 01:44:40.149]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[01:44:40.589 --> 01:44:44.911]  You need to do research into iodine and the iodine conspiracy for yourself.
[01:44:45.392 --> 01:44:47.173]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[01:44:47.593 --> 01:44:48.874]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[01:44:48.894 --> 01:44:51.695]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[01:44:52.175 --> 01:44:54.517]  I want like a 4.9 star on power reviews.
[01:44:55.117 --> 01:44:58.579]  But many of you hear me talk about this and it's just more background chatter.
[01:44:59.459 --> 01:45:01.861]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[01:45:02.947 --> 01:45:05.269]  Is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[01:45:05.729 --> 01:45:18.097]  So from our brain waves to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[01:45:18.598 --> 01:45:21.099]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:22.820]  So iodine is amazing.
[01:45:22.860 --> 01:45:23.421]  It's important.
[01:45:23.441 --> 01:45:25.682]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[01:45:25.762 --> 01:45:26.263]  They'll hurt you.
[01:45:26.643 --> 01:45:27.343]  This is pure.
[01:45:27.604 --> 01:45:28.324]  This is clean.
[01:45:28.664 --> 01:45:29.445]  This is amazing.
[01:45:29.765 --> 01:45:31.566]  And it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[01:45:33.087 --> 01:45:36.750]  X2, our overall best-selling product, is now back.
[01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:41.793]  X2 original from the very first original manufacturer.
[01:45:42.193 --> 01:45:48.737]  The exact same X2 at InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:45:48.797 --> 01:45:50.578]  As I said, get your pre-orders in.
[01:45:50.939 --> 01:45:51.719]  Week, week and a half.
[01:45:51.999 --> 01:45:53.160]  It's being labeled right now.
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:53.961]  It's already been bottled.
[01:45:54.241 --> 01:46:00.785]  And we are going to have it for you, ladies and gentlemen, at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLive.com.

[01:46:15.791 --> 01:46:20.052]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:46:20.473 --> 01:46:23.734]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.

[01:46:59.165 --> 01:47:00.426]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:25.063 --> 01:47:31.316]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:53.869 --> 01:47:55.210]  Alright, Robert Barnes is our guest.
[01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:56.251]  Laura Loomer is coming up.
[01:47:58.173 --> 01:48:00.415]  Robert, let's shift gears into what I mentioned earlier.
[01:48:00.616 --> 01:48:03.518]  Other forms of censorship by the so-called left.
[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:17.112]  Making girls sports and women's sports from the Olympics down to collegiate and college down to just regular peewee sports.
[01:48:18.669 --> 01:48:21.511]  Where you have to let men compete.
[01:48:21.691 --> 01:48:23.912]  It's an obscene Monty Python joke.
[01:48:25.053 --> 01:48:29.435]  And now this story is up on InfoWars.com from InformationLiberation.com.
[01:48:30.536 --> 01:48:35.979]  Catholic journalist criminally investigated for using the wrong pronoun in a tweet.
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:43.784]  In our brave new world, misgendering, also known as accurately gendering someone, is a crime worse than murder.
[01:48:44.584 --> 01:48:46.906]  A British Catholic journalist is being investigated by police
[01:48:48.206 --> 01:49:03.998]  For allegedly misgendering someone in a tweet, Carolyn Farrow was contacted by authorities after making an appearance on Good Morning Britain, in which she engaged in a debate with a transgender activist, or a god, Susie Green, who has a trans child.
[01:49:05.666 --> 01:49:14.418]  Following, because you can't protect these children, following the appearance which took place last September, she reportedly got a visit from the police.
[01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:17.182]  And of course, California has passed a law on this.
[01:49:17.262 --> 01:49:22.369]  So, even if I wanted to call a man a walrus,
[01:49:23.362 --> 01:49:25.984]  Or I wanted to call a lady a monkey.
[01:49:26.664 --> 01:49:30.807]  Or I wanted to be, you know, crazy and say that a person was a fire hydrant.
[01:49:31.507 --> 01:49:32.488]  I have a right to do that.
[01:49:32.888 --> 01:49:38.951]  But now it's a law that I have to, when someone's really a man, I have to say they're really a woman because they say so.
[01:49:39.212 --> 01:49:40.973]  This is like occult mind control.
[01:49:41.313 --> 01:49:47.937]  So as a constitutional lawyer, what can be done to strike back against these egregious affronts to free expression and free speech?
[01:49:49.192 --> 01:49:52.053]  Well, it's happening on college campuses across the country.
[01:49:52.753 --> 01:50:06.577]  Canada should have learned their lesson because it was the passing of those laws in Canada that unleashed Dr. Jordan Peterson and has made him famous now around the world for challenging, questioning a lot of established narratives, both within academia and the broader press.
[01:50:06.978 --> 01:50:08.178]  This is classic newspeak.
[01:50:08.818 --> 01:50:13.079]  It's literally someone's looking at Orwell's book and thought it was a wonderful script for how the world should operate.
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:14.860]  And that's how pretty much this is going.
[01:50:15.402 --> 01:50:20.805]  And to say that a man is a woman or a woman's a man or Lord knows what else is going to be coming down the pipeline.
[01:50:21.045 --> 01:50:22.566]  And also to make that subjective.
[01:50:22.926 --> 01:50:26.948]  I mean, how is even someone supposed to necessarily know what pronoun they're supposed to use?
[01:50:27.308 --> 01:50:35.512]  At the University of Tennessee, they're telling people to use the word Z. So it's not he, not she, just Z. It's becoming an onion satire.
[01:50:35.532 --> 01:50:39.914]  And as you know, it's basically a Monty Python script from about 25 years ago that's now real life.
[01:50:40.410 --> 01:50:45.214]  So I think for First Amendment purposes, these kind of speech codes should not be allowed in the United States.
[01:50:45.634 --> 01:50:49.217]  And historically, whenever they've been challenged or contested, they've been struck down.
[01:50:49.537 --> 01:50:55.081]  So the first set of speech codes that happened in the early 1990s ended up going through the court system in the late 90s, early 2000s.
[01:50:55.422 --> 01:51:02.407]  And the courts recognized and acknowledged that, yes, indeed, such speech codes violate the First Amendment rights to speak and express as you see fit.
[01:51:03.207 --> 01:51:06.470]  Now, it doesn't always apply to private universities, doesn't always apply to certain
[01:51:06.752 --> 01:51:08.972]  Private employers, and that's really their goal.
[01:51:08.992 --> 01:51:18.114]  Their goal is to get private universities and private employers and to privatize as much of the public square as possible so that they can achieve a censorious control over what you think.
[01:51:18.534 --> 01:51:23.795]  Because down deep, what all of these things have in common is they do not have confidence in the audience to make up its own mind.
[01:51:24.115 --> 01:51:27.776]  They believe they need to control what the audience thinks, dictate what the audience thinks.
[01:51:27.876 --> 01:51:34.417]  Sure, and I mean, the idea of saying you're going to have some six foot four dude, he's wearing a pink shirt, clearly he's trying to start a fight.
[01:51:35.342 --> 01:51:37.103]  And they're like, hey guys, come on over here.
[01:51:37.183 --> 01:51:39.205]  Which they say to men and women, hey, we're ready for you.
[01:51:39.265 --> 01:51:40.946]  Hey, got a register open.
[01:51:41.326 --> 01:51:43.928]  And then he starts assaulting everybody and attacking.
[01:51:43.948 --> 01:51:46.790]  And the media defended it like, this is a good person.
[01:51:47.090 --> 01:51:47.911]  It's a good woman.
[01:51:48.471 --> 01:51:51.493]  And then it turns out he's some super hardcore ex-felon psycho.
[01:51:52.254 --> 01:51:53.455]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[01:51:54.488 --> 01:51:58.650]  I think he's even got a rap song out there now.
[01:51:58.750 --> 01:52:02.851]  So it's all about momentary social media fame in that sort of crazy world.
[01:52:03.311 --> 01:52:19.277]  I mean, when you had people like the man who decided to declare himself a woman and compete in the Australian Handball and other competitions and then just dominated those competitions, it's really what's coming about is feminists, true original first order feminists of the Camille Paglia crowd.
[01:52:19.724 --> 01:52:23.370]  Well yeah, imagine if men just start going in women's restrooms saying, no I can be in here.
[01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:26.555]  Don't women get this is like a group of sickos assaulting them?
[01:52:35.495 --> 01:52:46.061]  Well, at some point it basically denies... I mean, the entire premise of feminism is that there are certain traits unique to women, certain attributes unique to women, certain history of discrimination against women solely based on their gender.
[01:52:46.441 --> 01:52:49.422]  Transgenderism says there's no such thing as gender, period, effectively.
[01:52:49.682 --> 01:52:52.184]  That it's purely a selective social construct.
[01:52:52.204 --> 01:52:53.985]  I just can't believe they let dudes...
[01:52:55.346 --> 01:52:58.047]  Dominate girls in cycling and running.
[01:52:58.107 --> 01:52:59.188]  It's all a joke.
[01:52:59.508 --> 01:53:01.730]  The girl right behind the guy is the real winner.
[01:53:02.250 --> 01:53:04.372]  It's just, and I can't believe these guys do this.
[01:53:04.472 --> 01:53:05.553]  It's just incredible.
[01:53:06.593 --> 01:53:07.074]  Oh, exactly.
[01:53:07.094 --> 01:53:08.635]  I mean, it's like a bad South Park episode.
[01:53:09.015 --> 01:53:20.022]  So if, you know, if my daughter was competing in one of these competitions and some guy went out there and pretended to be a woman, I would be highly offended because it interferes with the actual competition standards that were supposed to be established.
[01:53:20.423 --> 01:53:22.204]  So it's another place where the social construct
[01:53:22.563 --> 01:53:23.203]  We're good to go.
[01:53:52.549 --> 01:53:55.017]  Oh, it's completely insane.
[01:53:55.057 --> 01:53:56.643]  I mean, and it's a total redefinition.
[01:53:57.148 --> 01:54:00.751]  Of what's supposed to be happening in terms of athletic competition.
[01:54:00.971 --> 01:54:02.231]  But it's also cultural control.
[01:54:02.312 --> 01:54:05.334]  It's an attempt to reconstruct how people perceive the world.
[01:54:05.714 --> 01:54:07.315]  Ultimately, it's going to reach other steps.
[01:54:07.355 --> 01:54:10.817]  You already have some people trying to normalize pedophilia and other behavior.
[01:54:11.157 --> 01:54:15.480]  Trying to basically make extreme, unusual behavior the norm and the customary.
[01:54:15.821 --> 01:54:20.544]  To the point to where your basic understanding of biology and history is gone.
[01:54:20.564 --> 01:54:24.967]  But I mean, I'm looking at these dudes, men that are on women's rugby teams.
[01:54:24.987 --> 01:54:26.408]  They look like they could kick my ass.
[01:54:27.088 --> 01:54:33.171]  Like six foot four giant dudes and girls have to, I mean, this is, this is a joke, man.
[01:54:33.191 --> 01:54:34.912]  I mean, he's a dude.
[01:54:36.353 --> 01:54:36.814]  Precisely.
[01:54:36.914 --> 01:54:41.616]  And it's obvious to everyone that that's the case and pretending it's otherwise is deeply Orwellian.
[01:54:41.776 --> 01:54:47.480]  By the way, if you're watching on TV or radio, we have obviously men winning powerlifting competitions against girls.
[01:54:49.261 --> 01:54:49.681]  Exactly.
[01:54:50.001 --> 01:54:51.682]  I mean, it's, it's ridiculous.
[01:54:51.742 --> 01:54:55.344]  I mean, it's like an animal house skit and that has become social reality.
[01:54:55.808 --> 01:54:59.031]  And it's very anti-feminist at core.
[01:54:59.291 --> 01:55:01.413]  Because at the end of the day, it's undermining women.
[01:55:02.113 --> 01:55:05.396]  It's denying women equal independent access.
[01:55:05.656 --> 01:55:08.819]  It's denying women the achievements that they have rightfully earned.
[01:55:09.464 --> 01:55:12.086]  Uh, and so really it's sort of a chauvinistic thing.
[01:55:12.226 --> 01:55:12.666]  It is!
[01:55:12.786 --> 01:55:13.286]  Imagine!
[01:55:13.827 --> 01:55:18.309]  Because it's everything feminists said they feared, but now it's coming back to their own leftist situation.
[01:55:18.329 --> 01:55:20.250]  I want to do five more minutes with you and then I gotta go.
[01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:25.593]  I want to get into what else you think Trump should do and what you think is coming up in the election and so much more with Robert Barnes.
[01:55:25.613 --> 01:55:28.075]  I want to ask you what you think Trump's Achilles heel is, but first...
[01:55:29.713 --> 01:55:38.837]  Ladies and gentlemen, they want to shut down the free market because what's left of it still allows you to vote with your ideas, still allows you to vote with your feet, vote with your dollars, vote with your actions.
[01:55:39.497 --> 01:55:42.318]  And we make it easy to vote with your actions at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:55:42.758 --> 01:55:45.459]  We bring you the best non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[01:55:45.479 --> 01:55:50.361]  We bring you the best air filtration systems, the best water filtration systems at the lowest prices.
[01:55:50.401 --> 01:55:53.843]  I go out and get, because there's different types of sales out there.
[01:55:54.738 --> 01:55:56.619]  There's people that want to buy the most expensive thing.
[01:55:56.659 --> 01:55:57.160]  It's the best.
[01:55:57.180 --> 01:55:59.221]  So you can find an air filter that costs $1,000.
[01:56:01.002 --> 01:56:03.704]  But then there's a market for folks that want the very best lowest price.
[01:56:04.125 --> 01:56:04.825]  You can buy one for $200.
[01:56:04.865 --> 01:56:07.067]  That's the same unit.
[01:56:08.207 --> 01:56:12.130]  It just has a plastic case instead of an aluminum case and a few other things.
[01:56:12.190 --> 01:56:16.133]  It's got a four stage filter and it's $200, not $1,000.
[01:56:16.333 --> 01:56:18.415]  The leading competitors are about $500.
[01:56:18.755 --> 01:56:21.016]  And they're plastic, too.
[01:56:21.617 --> 01:56:22.838]  That's Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:56:22.858 --> 01:56:24.339]  And that's just an example of my philosophy.
[01:56:25.979 --> 01:56:28.140]  What is the best at the lowest price?
[01:56:28.281 --> 01:56:31.663]  We're the type of marketers that go, what is the best at the lowest price?
[01:56:31.843 --> 01:56:33.184]  Because that's how I want to be treated.
[01:56:33.664 --> 01:56:34.725]  Didn't go to college for that.
[01:56:34.785 --> 01:56:35.625]  Didn't take marketing.
[01:56:36.486 --> 01:56:40.469]  People, top marketers come, they say, oh, it's genius how you have this, you know, best product, lowest price.
[01:56:40.509 --> 01:56:41.589]  Well, that's what I want.
[01:56:42.350 --> 01:56:50.155]  So our fish oil, our nootropics like Rainforce, all of it, it's storewide free shipping, storewide free shipping.
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:55.063]  And it's 50% off all the supplements and a bunch of other specials too numerous to name.
[01:56:55.343 --> 01:56:59.266]  Instead of getting five cents on every dollar on the next order with your profile.
[01:57:01.222 --> 01:57:03.803]  The shopping cart in Fullershore.com.
[01:57:04.103 --> 01:57:05.704]  You get 10 cents on every dollar.
[01:57:05.764 --> 01:57:06.404]  That's huge.
[01:57:07.084 --> 01:57:09.545]  That's going to be going right through the month of March.
[01:57:09.605 --> 01:57:13.566]  But we did have to take the protein bars off because they're about to sell out.
[01:57:13.906 --> 01:57:15.067]  Can't sell those 50% off.
[01:57:15.967 --> 01:57:19.448]  I said take TurboForce off, but you notice it's still there, which it's fine.
[01:57:19.868 --> 01:57:21.509]  That's about to sell out, so that's going to be gone.
[01:57:22.209 --> 01:57:23.549]  BrainForce X2.
[01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:25.310]  We didn't think we'd get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[01:57:26.335 --> 01:57:28.456]  So I broke my contract because he put me over a barrel.
[01:57:28.476 --> 01:57:30.578]  Well, that made him back off and not overcharge me.
[01:57:30.878 --> 01:57:34.760]  So now the original manufacturer, X2, the great, good halogen, the good, clean iodine.
[01:57:35.421 --> 01:57:39.063]  It's available at mfulworthstore.com, and your purchase makes it all possible.
[01:57:39.564 --> 01:57:43.766]  Read the 8,000 plus reviews, 98% reviews for X2, and get your bottle today.
[01:57:44.126 --> 01:57:46.608]  Too much time, you know, it takes to get into it.
[01:57:46.628 --> 01:57:47.569]  Just research it for yourself.
[01:57:47.929 --> 01:57:51.071]  It's the Missing Link X2, now back at mfulworthslife.com.
[01:57:54.511 --> 01:57:58.974]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[01:57:59.195 --> 01:58:03.818]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[01:58:03.838 --> 01:58:10.363]  And they said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[01:58:10.763 --> 01:58:23.373]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered, so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[01:58:24.113 --> 01:58:25.674]  Unlike other systems.
[01:58:25.734 --> 01:58:31.219]  I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues.
[01:58:31.239 --> 01:58:32.820]  He writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:34.702]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[01:58:35.042 --> 01:58:36.223]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[01:58:36.423 --> 01:58:37.464]  Doesn't smoke marijuana.
[01:58:37.824 --> 01:58:38.845]  Doesn't drink anything.
[01:58:39.045 --> 01:58:40.525]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[01:58:41.046 --> 01:58:42.646]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[01:58:42.666 --> 01:58:44.447]  I only have to take one knockout.
[01:58:44.807 --> 01:58:47.408]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[01:58:47.448 --> 01:58:48.308]  This is insane.
[01:58:48.708 --> 01:58:50.329]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[01:58:50.589 --> 01:58:53.129]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[01:58:53.590 --> 01:58:55.110]  He says, this is totally free.
[01:58:55.150 --> 01:58:56.971]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[01:58:56.991 --> 01:58:58.851]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[01:58:59.712 --> 01:59:05.653]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[01:59:05.893 --> 01:59:07.234]  All just moderate dose.
[01:59:08.766 --> 01:59:16.750]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[01:59:16.770 --> 01:59:19.172]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:19.212 --> 01:59:20.352]  But thank you for committing.
[01:59:24.418 --> 01:59:27.241]  They get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[01:59:27.621 --> 01:59:30.223]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[01:59:30.243 --> 01:59:35.007]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[01:59:35.487 --> 01:59:41.613]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[01:59:41.633 --> 01:59:44.755]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[01:59:45.096 --> 01:59:46.397]  It's called reap what you sow.
[01:59:56.915 --> 02:00:06.641]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:06.661 --> 02:00:15.287]  From the front lines, from the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.447 --> 02:00:17.408]  Poets tell how Poncho fell.
[02:00:17.428 --> 02:00:19.750]  Poets tell how Poncho fell.
[02:00:26.887 --> 02:00:28.347]  Desert's quiet.
[02:00:29.327 --> 02:00:30.487]  Cleveland's cold.
[02:00:33.128 --> 02:00:35.348]  I got a full plate of stuff we haven't even hit yet.
[02:00:36.509 --> 02:00:37.529]  Wait till the next segment.
[02:00:39.249 --> 02:00:41.189]  We're talking to Robert Barnes, really smart guy.
[02:00:42.290 --> 02:00:45.330]  The globalists are looking for Trump's Achilles heel.
[02:00:46.030 --> 02:00:48.371]  And I think Trump's Achilles heel is compromising
[02:00:49.722 --> 02:00:51.623]  People want the bull in the China cabinet.
[02:00:51.643 --> 02:00:52.604]  They want him to execute.
[02:00:52.624 --> 02:00:55.766]  I think it's Achilles heel is that he's surrounded by so many enemies.
[02:00:56.226 --> 02:00:59.509]  I mean nothing against Conway, but her husband and all that, she needs to be fired.
[02:01:00.211 --> 02:01:01.251]  I mean, I would not.
[02:01:01.351 --> 02:01:03.992]  I mean, that guy's completely out of control, pushing the 25th Amendment agenda.
[02:01:04.392 --> 02:01:06.993]  What do you think Trump's Achilles heels are?
[02:01:07.053 --> 02:01:13.535]  Because I know the White House listens, and we only get their attention when we get a little bit aggressive.
[02:01:14.375 --> 02:01:20.537]  But I do, I overall love what the President's doing in many ways, love the President, but I'm seeing him slide off his trajectory.
[02:01:21.057 --> 02:01:23.138]  And you know, think about a few point percentage.
[02:01:23.158 --> 02:01:26.279]  At first, doesn't look like a big point change, but then after a while,
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:29.101]  That's how it works.
[02:01:29.161 --> 02:01:34.708]  So, if he's planning to zig and zag, that's okay, but he needs to tell us he's about to do a loop-de-loop because I don't like this.
[02:01:36.910 --> 02:01:37.491]  No doubt about it.
[02:01:37.531 --> 02:01:48.023]  I think one of his fundamental Achilles heels is his belief that he can persuade people to come to a particular outcome rather than use his power to achieve that outcome.
[02:01:48.499 --> 02:01:50.880]  So I think in particular, this has been the case in big tech.
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:56.802]  I think, you know, his son has been very aggressive, promoting that the fact that the issues that are related there, too.
[02:01:57.142 --> 02:01:59.743]  He has himself tweeted on it and commented on it repeatedly.
[02:02:00.143 --> 02:02:06.765]  But I think he really thinks, well, you know, if I just lecture people enough and I talk about it enough, they'll come to the common sense solution.
[02:02:07.105 --> 02:02:09.306]  That's just not going to happen with big tech and the modern left.
[02:02:09.586 --> 02:02:11.527]  The modern left believes that power at all costs.
[02:02:11.847 --> 02:02:14.469]  That's why they're talking about scrapping the Electoral College.
[02:02:14.750 --> 02:02:16.791]  That's why they're talking about stacking the U.S.
[02:02:16.811 --> 02:02:17.472]  Supreme Court.
[02:02:17.512 --> 02:02:17.912]  That's right.
[02:02:17.972 --> 02:02:19.073]  They're on a jihad.
[02:02:19.133 --> 02:02:20.814]  They're on an attack.
[02:02:21.295 --> 02:02:22.456]  They're going for broke.
[02:02:23.597 --> 02:02:23.937]  Precisely.
[02:02:23.957 --> 02:02:25.238]  They believe in power at all costs.
[02:02:25.458 --> 02:02:26.539]  They don't care about principle.
[02:02:26.559 --> 02:02:28.321]  They don't care about any limitations on their power.
[02:02:28.861 --> 02:02:30.422]  Their principle is more power.
[02:02:30.602 --> 02:02:30.963]  Period.
[02:02:31.343 --> 02:02:37.468]  And until he recognizes that and accepts that and embraces the power of the presidency, he's at constant risk.
[02:02:37.867 --> 02:02:56.160]  Because if he doesn't get in control of what big tech is doing in terms of not only censoring voices, but controlling, manipulating, and monopolizing the public square for the purposes of a political partisan agenda that's hostile and adverse to him, then they will do the same thing in the 2020 election, but they'll do it in a more sophisticated way than what they did in the 2017
[02:03:01.344 --> 02:03:04.205]  That's right.
[02:03:04.266 --> 02:03:09.489]  He must embrace the power of the presidency against this outside globalist takeover or be destroyed, us with him.
[02:03:09.749 --> 02:03:11.250]  We're in radical extreme times.
[02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:16.794]  And that's why they've got Obama's professors saying they're scared Trump will stage an emergency to stay in power.
[02:03:17.054 --> 02:03:18.375]  He must be removed before then.
[02:03:18.635 --> 02:03:25.019]  Well, they're the ones saying in his own statement, we're going to stage the emergency to remove him, saying he's going to stage an emergency.
[02:03:25.179 --> 02:03:29.340]  We've got to have an emergency and remove him before the election because he's a dictator.
[02:03:29.561 --> 02:03:31.261]  No, you just said you're a dictator.
[02:03:32.602 --> 02:03:33.022]  Precisely.
[02:03:33.322 --> 02:03:35.062]  And they pose a direct and imminent threat.
[02:03:35.423 --> 02:03:42.325]  The greatest threat to the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the freedom of the market, the freedom of American democracy and liberty is at stake.
[02:03:42.665 --> 02:03:46.346]  Because big tech has a degree of control that has never been afforded before.
[02:03:46.646 --> 02:03:48.407]  And unless the president directly confronts it,
[02:03:48.707 --> 02:03:50.288]  And uses his presidential power.
[02:03:50.348 --> 02:04:09.734]  See, uses his power to do so lawfully, correctly, uses it as a legitimate factual basis to appoint a special counsel right now to investigate what Big Tech has been up to based on published reports of their interference and intervention in the 2017 election, and based on them censoring you and removing you from all of your platforms in discriminant and disparate ways.
[02:04:10.094 --> 02:04:24.219]  Those two facts allow a predicate right now to investigate whether they're politically manipulating their big tech control and the public policy and the public platform that they monopolize in order to favor one political party over another, which is a violation of various campaign finance and other laws.
[02:04:24.419 --> 02:04:24.779]  That's right.
[02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:25.720]  They started the fight.
[02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:27.521]  They've announced their tyrants.
[02:04:27.881 --> 02:04:28.681]  They're out of control.
[02:04:28.741 --> 02:04:29.522]  They brought us here.
[02:04:29.842 --> 02:04:30.742]  I don't want this to happen.
[02:04:31.002 --> 02:04:31.823]  I don't want martial law.
[02:04:32.043 --> 02:04:35.704]  The Democrats are saying civil emergency to overthrow everybody's rights and freedom.
[02:04:36.045 --> 02:04:38.045]  And they're going to have reparations and take property.
[02:04:38.386 --> 02:04:40.226]  This is a classic authoritarian takeover.
[02:04:40.487 --> 02:04:42.127]  Robert Barnes, thanks for spending time with us.
[02:04:42.407 --> 02:04:43.808]  I'll talk to you, by the way, after the show.
[02:04:43.828 --> 02:04:44.688]  We've got some planning to do.
[02:04:44.989 --> 02:04:45.469]  God bless you.
[02:04:45.489 --> 02:04:46.149]  Really appreciate you.
[02:04:47.070 --> 02:04:47.270]  Absolutely.
[02:04:47.290 --> 02:04:47.730]  Glad to be here.
[02:04:47.970 --> 02:04:48.690]  That's a lot of courage.
[02:04:48.710 --> 02:04:49.391]  That's a smart cookie.
[02:04:49.931 --> 02:04:50.271]  All right.
[02:04:50.331 --> 02:04:51.432]  Laura Loomer's coming up.
[02:04:51.472 --> 02:04:51.932]  But first,
[02:04:53.268 --> 02:04:55.709]  Did you hear about the Muslims setting fire to a bus full of kids?
[02:04:56.970 --> 02:04:59.831]  No, you won't hear about that unless you tune in to InfoWars.com.
[02:05:03.292 --> 02:05:08.955]  And now, and now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[02:05:09.095 --> 02:05:11.996]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.

[02:05:14.617 --> 02:05:15.857]  Free shipping storewide.

[02:06:11.078 --> 02:06:22.003]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[02:06:26.185 --> 02:06:28.927]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:34.813 --> 02:06:37.837]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[02:06:38.197 --> 02:06:44.105]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[02:06:44.525 --> 02:06:50.412]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[02:06:50.713 --> 02:06:53.356]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[02:06:53.636 --> 02:07:01.124]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[02:07:01.144 --> 02:07:09.353]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[02:07:09.954 --> 02:07:14.219]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[02:07:15.077 --> 02:07:18.678]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[02:07:18.878 --> 02:07:24.820]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:34.682]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[02:07:35.222 --> 02:07:39.403]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[02:07:39.443 --> 02:07:41.164]  You're probably going, wait a minute.
[02:07:42.267 --> 02:07:44.131]  For the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[02:07:44.612 --> 02:07:45.394]  It was the last run.
[02:07:45.414 --> 02:07:46.356]  It's been sold out for two months.
[02:07:47.472 --> 02:07:48.353]  How is X2 back?
[02:07:48.813 --> 02:07:52.415]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[02:07:52.896 --> 02:07:55.958]  We got put over the barrel, some industrial sabotage, we couldn't get it anymore.
[02:07:56.558 --> 02:08:06.585]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep-earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[02:08:06.665 --> 02:08:10.608]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[02:08:11.028 --> 02:08:12.149]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[02:08:12.569 --> 02:08:16.911]  You need to do research into iodine and the iodine conspiracy for yourself.
[02:08:17.371 --> 02:08:19.172]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[02:08:19.572 --> 02:08:20.892]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[02:08:21.413 --> 02:08:23.674]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[02:08:24.154 --> 02:08:26.495]  I want like a 4.9 star on power reviews.
[02:08:27.095 --> 02:08:30.596]  But many of you hear me talk about this and it's just more background chatter.
[02:08:31.437 --> 02:08:33.838]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[02:08:34.941 --> 02:08:37.282]  ...is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[02:08:37.722 --> 02:08:50.026]  So from our brain waves, to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[02:08:50.566 --> 02:08:53.647]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[02:08:53.667 --> 02:08:54.787]  So, iodine is amazing.
[02:08:54.827 --> 02:08:55.387]  It's important.
[02:08:55.407 --> 02:08:57.628]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[02:08:57.708 --> 02:08:58.228]  They'll hurt you.
[02:08:58.628 --> 02:08:59.308]  This is pure.
[02:08:59.588 --> 02:09:00.289]  This is clean.
[02:09:00.629 --> 02:09:01.409]  This is amazing.
[02:09:01.729 --> 02:09:04.390]  And it funds the InfoWars, a 360 win.
[02:09:04.410 --> 02:09:08.711]  So, X2, our overall best-selling product, is now back.
[02:09:09.011 --> 02:09:13.772]  X2 original from the very first original manufacturer.
[02:09:14.192 --> 02:09:18.894]  The exact same X2 at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253.
[02:09:20.134 --> 02:09:20.815]  And folks, I cut that ad.
[02:09:38.976 --> 02:09:41.877]  About two weeks ago, X-Tube is now in the warehouse shipping out.
[02:09:42.638 --> 02:09:43.478]  It's the good halogen.
[02:09:43.838 --> 02:09:44.979]  Now, I want to get into Italy.
[02:09:45.079 --> 02:09:49.361]  Migrants set bus full of children on fire as part of pro-refugee protests.
[02:09:49.381 --> 02:09:49.921]  That's coming up.
[02:09:50.281 --> 02:09:51.922]  And Laura Loomer has got the president's ear.
[02:09:52.242 --> 02:09:53.162]  She's going to be joining us.
[02:09:53.262 --> 02:09:55.703]  What an intrepid tiger she is.
[02:09:57.124 --> 02:10:02.066]  But first... I knew this, but I'd forgotten it.
[02:10:02.506 --> 02:10:05.087]  You know, like, you're sitting there researching something a year ago.
[02:10:05.408 --> 02:10:06.688]  You mean to make it a whole show.
[02:10:07.749 --> 02:10:08.449]  And then you forget.
[02:10:10.529 --> 02:10:17.644]  And then I was reading the news today, jury finds Bayer's Roundup weed killer caused man's cancer.
[02:10:18.606 --> 02:10:20.089]  San Francisco Wall Street Journal.
[02:10:21.363 --> 02:10:24.404]  And I go, wait a minute, Bayer bought Monsanto.
[02:10:24.825 --> 02:10:26.105]  And I'm like, oh, that's right.
[02:10:26.125 --> 02:10:31.528]  And then the FDA approved the replacement for Roundup, which is the same thing but stronger.
[02:10:31.588 --> 02:10:34.369]  It's kind of like heroin cured you from opium.
[02:10:34.930 --> 02:10:38.311]  At the end of the Civil War, they'd sawed off hundreds of thousands of arms and legs.
[02:10:38.331 --> 02:10:39.992]  I think it was over a million, actually.
[02:10:40.572 --> 02:10:41.793]  Close to a million died in that war.
[02:10:43.727 --> 02:10:49.909]  And people are addicted to opium, and so they go, oh, we got something that cures it.
[02:10:49.949 --> 02:10:53.670]  It's heroin that's 30, 40, 50 times stronger, depending on the heroin.
[02:10:55.250 --> 02:10:56.270]  So yeah, that'll cure you.
[02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:57.911]  That'll fix it for you.
[02:10:59.511 --> 02:11:00.231]  It's much stronger.
[02:11:00.531 --> 02:11:02.712]  You don't want opium anymore when you've got heroin.
[02:11:03.312 --> 02:11:08.113]  So this new product they've come out with, they admit is even stronger.
[02:11:08.173 --> 02:11:10.134]  It even messes up your body and gives you cancer worse.
[02:11:10.594 --> 02:11:11.574]  That's their replacement.
[02:11:12.611 --> 02:11:14.332]  And it was so fitting that it's Bayer.
[02:11:15.713 --> 02:11:17.434]  Everybody overuses the Nazi stuff.
[02:11:17.454 --> 02:11:20.175]  You know, if you believe in family or the Second Amendment, you're a Nazi.
[02:11:20.195 --> 02:11:21.396]  Or if you're white, you're a Nazi.
[02:11:23.397 --> 02:11:28.920]  Bayer was the second most powerful company in World War II under the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
[02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:31.822]  Because World War II was about that empire coming back.
[02:11:32.642 --> 02:11:34.663]  Supposedly ended in World War I. It didn't end.
[02:11:35.664 --> 02:11:36.484]  Just say the Germans.
[02:11:36.545 --> 02:11:37.305]  It's simpler that way.
[02:11:41.792 --> 02:11:50.542]  Bayer was the second most powerful family and company in pharmaceuticals, in industrial chemicals, in weapons, in everything.
[02:11:52.364 --> 02:11:56.708]  And Bayer is probably one of the most evil companies.
[02:11:56.768 --> 02:11:58.891]  I can't decide whether it's IBM or whether it's Bayer.
[02:11:59.111 --> 02:12:00.492]  Whereas IBM helped the Nazis as well.
[02:12:00.733 --> 02:12:01.353]  Can't make that up.
[02:12:01.413 --> 02:12:02.695]  It's just so crazy it's true.
[02:12:06.417 --> 02:12:21.572]  And it was Bayer worked with the Clintons on purpose for a decade to get bad blood out of Arkansas, out of prisoners that all had HIV and hepatitis, on purpose they wanted it, and they put it in Factor VIII and it came out in the corporate documents like 12 years ago.
[02:12:22.523 --> 02:12:26.224]  They were purposely shipping it out and said, yeah, we want to get rid of hemophiliacs.
[02:12:26.865 --> 02:12:28.165]  We're culling the population.
[02:12:28.205 --> 02:12:30.426]  So really, oh yeah, it's in the corporate documents.
[02:12:30.686 --> 02:12:33.067]  There's even been NBC pieces about it back when they told the truth.
[02:12:33.367 --> 02:12:39.269]  That Bayer executives that came out in lawsuits were putting it on paper that, show what if it's got HIV?
[02:12:39.550 --> 02:12:41.150]  We need to get rid of these hemophiliacs.
[02:12:42.511 --> 02:12:45.692]  Infected millions, killed probably a million people, nobody knows.
[02:12:46.912 --> 02:12:47.873]  So Bayer
[02:12:49.827 --> 02:12:50.167]  Bought!
[02:12:50.708 --> 02:12:51.568]  Monsanto!
[02:12:51.668 --> 02:12:54.010]  How perfect is that?
[02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:56.191]  Bayer that gave you dioxin.
[02:12:56.692 --> 02:12:58.113]  Bayer that gave you Agent Orange.
[02:13:00.854 --> 02:13:03.196]  God, I think about how much my family's been touched by these people.
[02:13:03.536 --> 02:13:06.078]  I'm not gonna get into private stories, but my God.
[02:13:09.700 --> 02:13:11.281]  Everybody I know went to Vietnam.
[02:13:11.301 --> 02:13:12.422]  Their first kid was deformed.
[02:13:13.043 --> 02:13:15.224]  No history of deformities in the family.
[02:13:17.505 --> 02:13:18.486]  Multiple members of the family.
[02:13:18.666 --> 02:13:19.307]  Different sides.
[02:13:20.612 --> 02:13:26.481]  Because you bioaccumulate, and it takes a decade or so to get out.
[02:13:26.501 --> 02:13:29.285]  These men came back, had their first, and they're just, it's all fried.
[02:13:29.606 --> 02:13:30.608]  Chromosomes are all fried.
[02:13:31.649 --> 02:13:33.632]  But, I'm not gonna digress.
[02:13:34.273 --> 02:13:35.175]  That's just another story.
[02:13:37.682 --> 02:13:42.363]  You know, like my grandmother gets the polio shot, and it gives it to her, and the doctors tell her, you got polio from the shot, sorry.
[02:13:42.803 --> 02:13:45.304]  You know, it's just like, oh, but don't question vaccines!
[02:13:45.704 --> 02:13:49.204]  Everybody's got their vaccine horror story, where you take it, and you almost die, or you do die.
[02:13:49.965 --> 02:13:51.005]  Your kid has a convulsion.
[02:13:51.925 --> 02:13:55.526]  Bites their tongue, blood splattering everywhere, and you talk about it, Facebook bans you.
[02:13:55.786 --> 02:13:57.726]  We're gonna hurt your kid, and you're gonna take it!
[02:14:00.667 --> 02:14:01.187]  So there you go.
[02:14:03.089 --> 02:14:06.332]  It's just this mad medical system, and then Bayer Pharmaceutical.
[02:14:06.812 --> 02:14:08.193]  Type in Bayer Blood Scandal.
[02:14:08.213 --> 02:14:09.534]  Let's see if Google's removed that yet.
[02:14:09.614 --> 02:14:09.815]  Click.
[02:14:10.115 --> 02:14:10.775]  Go to YouTube.
[02:14:10.795 --> 02:14:12.477]  Type in Bayer Blood Scandal.
[02:14:13.938 --> 02:14:16.720]  It was NBC, like 12 years ago, admitted what was in the court filings.
[02:14:17.561 --> 02:14:21.044]  That they knew it was giving you HIV and hepatitis, and they did it anyways.
[02:14:21.424 --> 02:14:24.587]  And then now, perfect, they've bought Monsanto.
[02:14:27.069 --> 02:14:28.049]  There it is, CBS News.
[02:14:28.410 --> 02:14:30.892]  Bayer Adminsit paid millions in HIV infection cases.
[02:14:33.072 --> 02:14:34.093]  Just not in English.
[02:14:34.753 --> 02:14:35.834]  Whatever, it's all whitewash.
[02:14:36.354 --> 02:14:36.835]  Look at this!
[02:14:38.616 --> 02:14:41.758]  Dicambia, Monsanto and the dangers of pesticide drift.
[02:14:42.158 --> 02:14:43.759]  A modern farmer explainer.
[02:14:44.620 --> 02:14:48.423]  Bayer to buy Monsanto, creating a massive seeds and pesticides company.
[02:14:48.743 --> 02:14:51.245]  Bayer bought Monsanto and is now stuck with the biggest headache.
[02:14:51.645 --> 02:14:54.087]  No, that's Bayer's job is exterminating people.
[02:14:55.187 --> 02:14:56.789]  They're literally a Nazi company.
[02:14:57.631 --> 02:15:05.095]  Just like Bill Gates and the Kaiser Wilhelm Cold Springs Harbor Institute that his father ran for the army in covert operations.
[02:15:05.415 --> 02:15:08.377]  Yeah, Bill Gates' daddy didn't just head up Planned Parenthood.
[02:15:08.737 --> 02:15:10.819]  He was involved in covert army operations.
[02:15:11.299 --> 02:15:18.503]  And that's why Bill Gates has had me threatened and a bunch of other stuff because they know I know the people off record worked with Gates' daddy!
[02:15:24.141 --> 02:15:25.462]  This is why they want us shut up.
[02:15:25.502 --> 02:15:27.583]  Yeah, look, Bayer HIV scandal.
[02:15:28.524 --> 02:15:30.466]  Or also known as the Arkansas blood scandal.
[02:15:30.946 --> 02:15:36.650]  One day after I had the medical doctor on that exposed it all, who worked in the prison, his office was firebombed.
[02:15:36.670 --> 02:15:42.694]  And the offices of the Hemophiliac Society in Canada were hit the same night.
[02:15:43.575 --> 02:15:45.316]  Then their families all got death-threatened.
[02:15:46.577 --> 02:15:47.998]  Then a bunch of people disappeared.
[02:15:49.899 --> 02:15:51.721]  All so they could inject you with HIV.
[02:15:55.752 --> 02:15:57.535]  It's called population reduction.
[02:15:58.476 --> 02:15:59.217]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:59.237 --> 02:15:59.898]  Stay with us.
[02:16:04.051 --> 02:16:13.479]  We're going to do, this Thursday through Friday through Saturday, a 50-hour emergency Save the First Amendment broadcast with a bunch of special guests and a bunch of stuff we've never done before.
[02:16:13.599 --> 02:16:14.740]  Believe me, this is going to be special.
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:15.701]  Thursday 8 a.m.
[02:16:15.721 --> 02:16:19.304]  with David Knight, right through Saturday 10 a.m., 50 hours, a bunch of special guests.
[02:16:19.424 --> 02:16:25.369]  We're going to blur out the violence, but we're going to look at all the anomalies, not even saying there's anomalies.
[02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:26.790]  We have a right to.
[02:16:27.130 --> 02:16:27.691]  Bill Johnson?
[02:16:27.831 --> 02:16:29.192]  No, I completely agree with you.
[02:16:29.532 --> 02:16:32.955]  And it should be done, because the liberal media, they're not going to show any of that.
[02:16:32.975 --> 02:16:34.136]  They're not going to talk about that.
[02:16:34.276 --> 02:16:38.059]  They want to push this narrative again, that it's white supremacy.
[02:16:38.079 --> 02:16:42.944]  And even when you read through all the information, he doesn't look like he's a white supremacy.
[02:16:42.984 --> 02:16:44.865]  He's completely for the Green Deal.
[02:16:44.965 --> 02:16:50.510]  He's against President Trump, but yet you have the media, even Fox News, pushing that he's a white supremacist.
[02:16:50.570 --> 02:16:50.810]  Why?
[02:16:50.970 --> 02:16:53.853]  Because all racist roads lead to white people.
[02:16:54.373 --> 02:16:55.334]  I mean, it's sickening.
[02:16:55.654 --> 02:17:11.304]  The truth is, governments do do stuff like this, and it's legitimate for anybody to ask those type of questions.

[02:18:48.630 --> 02:18:51.334]  Protein packed and full of fiber and healthy ingredients.

[02:19:03.260 --> 02:19:12.126]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist, pro-free market, pro-Western speech all across the world.
[02:19:12.926 --> 02:19:18.850]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last year to be de-platformed.
[02:19:19.410 --> 02:19:20.451]  Then they set the precedent.
[02:19:20.911 --> 02:19:25.054]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert,
[02:19:25.794 --> 02:19:27.175]  They take you off the internet.
[02:19:27.255 --> 02:19:37.160]  Now, Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of most types on their platform because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:48.646]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist, anti-human, transhumanist, who literally think they own and run our lives.
[02:19:48.866 --> 02:19:50.527]  And if we keep bowing to these cults,
[02:19:51.147 --> 02:19:57.130]  The cancer that is San Francisco and many of these big universities is going to be the operating system of the planet.
[02:19:57.631 --> 02:20:01.153]  Humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks!
[02:20:06.315 --> 02:20:08.957]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:27.011]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:20:27.031 --> 02:20:28.931]  We're about to talk to Laura Loomer for the balance of the hour.
[02:20:29.431 --> 02:20:31.312]  She's been really pushing Stop the Bias.
[02:20:31.712 --> 02:20:34.733]  Her name's been trending every few weeks at the top of Twitter after she was banned.
[02:20:35.093 --> 02:20:37.794]  She's been doing incredible activism around the country and the world.
[02:20:38.414 --> 02:20:41.575]  She's going to be with us during the 50-hour broadcast coming up that kicks off 8 a.m.
[02:20:41.675 --> 02:20:44.076]  Thursday, runs through Saturday at 10 a.m.
[02:20:44.116 --> 02:20:46.117]  to stop the bias and stop big tech censorship.
[02:20:46.137 --> 02:20:48.998]  We're going to develop plans to take action, lawsuits, you name it.
[02:20:49.438 --> 02:20:50.698]  Be sure and be part of that.
[02:20:50.718 --> 02:20:52.339]  But if you just joined us,
[02:20:54.059 --> 02:21:02.143]  Monsanto stock, which is Bayer stock, they bought it last year, is way down right now after more and more courts are ruling it does cause cancer, it does kill people.
[02:21:02.183 --> 02:21:03.303]  Well, it's designed to do that.
[02:21:03.864 --> 02:21:05.004]  But why did Bayer buy it?
[02:21:05.104 --> 02:21:14.369]  Bayer did with the Clintons the whole blood doping scandal where they put, on purpose, HIV and hepatitis blood into the factory rate for hemophiliacs and others.
[02:21:15.969 --> 02:21:22.773]  This is about population reduction and it's about getting away with it and seeing what they can do.
[02:21:24.051 --> 02:21:26.473]  That's why these groups are so dangerous.
[02:21:26.814 --> 02:21:28.936]  And they're all testing and seeing what you'll put up with.
[02:21:29.316 --> 02:21:34.241]  I expect the government to create, like they did back in the 80s, a Roundup damage fund that's secret.
[02:21:34.561 --> 02:21:43.529]  So if you're damaged by Roundup, you secretly have to go through court and get a little stipend or tiny payoff for your dead family or deformed children or the cancer you got.
[02:21:44.310 --> 02:21:46.513]  But then, of course, they'll probably still keep using Roundup.
[02:21:46.533 --> 02:21:50.937]  But their answer is to come up with something even stronger, even more deadly.
[02:21:51.398 --> 02:21:52.719]  And again, we broke that down.
[02:21:53.019 --> 02:21:54.441]  We'll get into it more coming up.
[02:21:55.694 --> 02:21:56.715]  But that's what they always do.
[02:21:57.175 --> 02:21:59.296]  Laura Lummer joins us via the telephone.
[02:21:59.636 --> 02:22:01.697]  Hopefully get her on Skype during the 50-hour broadcast.
[02:22:02.457 --> 02:22:04.899]  But Trump says, I'll be looking in to stop the bias.
[02:22:04.939 --> 02:22:06.059]  Hashtag stop the bias.
[02:22:07.100 --> 02:22:08.941]  He said just last week, everybody's hard.
[02:22:09.001 --> 02:22:09.701]  It was a right mark.
[02:22:10.081 --> 02:22:13.223]  Oh, just be better behaved than the leftist so you don't get banned.
[02:22:13.283 --> 02:22:14.584]  What, like Prager University?
[02:22:14.624 --> 02:22:24.309]  And now you've got these top leftists out there, like the Recode podcast with Kara Swisher, who talks to all the top tech people saying, ban
[02:22:25.310 --> 02:22:26.511]  Van Shapiro now.
[02:22:26.952 --> 02:22:28.734]  So where do you see all this going, Lauren?
[02:22:28.754 --> 02:22:29.915]  I know you've got a lot of breaking news.
[02:22:31.448 --> 02:22:32.809]  Yeah, well, it's only going to get worse.
[02:22:32.849 --> 02:22:34.010]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:22:34.791 --> 02:22:42.237]  I'm currently in California, you know, the heart of where all of this big tech censorship is taking place, which is why I couldn't get on Skype today.
[02:22:42.257 --> 02:22:46.721]  I'm in the middle of some investigations and some work that I'm doing here.
[02:22:47.362 --> 02:22:55.209]  But now we see the president himself is starting to realize the significance and the magnitude of the social media bias.
[02:22:55.709 --> 02:23:07.896]  Yesterday, his director of social media received a notification on Facebook that said that Facebook was blocking him, I believe, for 30 days from responding to people's comments on the president's page.
[02:23:08.336 --> 02:23:10.858]  So, Facebook now is being so brazen.
[02:23:10.878 --> 02:23:13.019]  They're not even trying to hide the fact that they're shadowbailing.
[02:23:13.059 --> 02:23:16.481]  And let's be clear, they said, oh, we apologize, we thought you were a bot.
[02:23:16.781 --> 02:23:19.482]  Every time they get caught, they go, oh, it's an accident.
[02:23:19.542 --> 02:23:20.283]  No, it's not an accident.
[02:23:21.914 --> 02:23:24.396]  Yeah, no, it's never an accident, right?
[02:23:24.616 --> 02:23:31.960]  But I think Trump now finally realizes that he really needs to act on this because the 2020 election really depends on it.
[02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:43.948]  Because now these social media companies are really starting to signal to Trump that the digital war is in full effect.
[02:23:44.468 --> 02:23:49.211]  And like I said, I've been saying this for almost two years now, right?
[02:23:49.231 --> 02:23:50.432]  The social media bias.
[02:23:50.996 --> 02:23:51.416]  I think so.
[02:24:07.021 --> 02:24:07.441]  I think so.
[02:24:21.849 --> 02:24:31.512]  How these same representatives are now complaining, and they're saying, oh, look, I have to sue Twitter now because of all the shadow banning, like Devin Nunes.
[02:24:31.592 --> 02:24:44.737]  I think it's great that he's suing, but where were these people seven months ago when the media and social media was making a laughing stock out of you and I when we were thrown out of the hearings?
[02:24:46.681 --> 02:24:57.457]  Well, what's crazy is, we have all their internal documents, we have all their internal videos, they admit they're doing it, and then they lie before Congress, they do all this, and then Trump just sits there and takes it.
[02:24:58.342 --> 02:25:00.543]  Going, well, it doesn't matter, my message will still go out.
[02:25:00.663 --> 02:25:02.064]  No, your message is not getting out.
[02:25:02.324 --> 02:25:04.645]  They're blocking videos of the president all over the internet.
[02:25:05.205 --> 02:25:11.249]  And just because he gets his news from Fox or CNN because he's 72 years old, that's all fine and dandy.
[02:25:11.629 --> 02:25:13.450]  Most people don't, Mr. President.
[02:25:13.710 --> 02:25:17.212]  They're basically banning you from the public square, Trump.
[02:25:17.952 --> 02:25:21.153]  So I'm not your enemy, I'm your friend, but I'm saying your house is on fire.
[02:25:21.514 --> 02:25:23.755]  Either put the damn house out or let's evacuate.
[02:25:25.322 --> 02:25:25.582]  Yeah.
[02:25:26.223 --> 02:25:31.868]  No, they need to do something about it because, really, it's a human rights violation as far as I'm concerned.
[02:25:31.928 --> 02:25:33.649]  It's not even just a matter of free speech.
[02:25:34.810 --> 02:25:40.035]  Our civil liberties are being violated to the maximum level in this country.
[02:25:40.476 --> 02:25:47.462]  And just like skin color, like race, religion, those are protected classes in our discrimination laws and our civil rights
[02:25:48.102 --> 02:25:52.924]  I was about to say, they've gone completely insane left, and we'll talk about that in the next segment.
[02:25:52.944 --> 02:25:54.604]  But sure, if he abandons us, what's the point?
[02:25:54.624 --> 02:25:56.485]  People are saying, if he wins, go ahead.
[02:26:13.191 --> 02:26:30.261]  Yeah, no, and so if he does win, it's only going to get worse, and I think that this is going to transition to the grocery store, to our electric company, to the water company, and you may think that sounds insane, but I think that- Laura, they've already banned thousands of conservatives from Uber!
[02:26:30.461 --> 02:26:32.042]  They're banning people from Airbnb!
[02:26:32.142 --> 02:26:34.243]  Yeah, trust me, I know, I was one of the first!
[02:26:35.364 --> 02:26:35.784]  No, I know!
[02:26:37.951 --> 02:26:39.451]  For speaking truth about Islam!
[02:26:39.511 --> 02:26:43.272]  And isn't it funny how Islam seems to be the thing that you're not allowed to talk about?
[02:26:43.332 --> 02:26:46.993]  I mean, look, they even canned Judge Jeanine Pirro.
[02:26:47.293 --> 02:26:48.213]  So isn't it funny?
[02:26:48.353 --> 02:26:49.533]  I love Judge Jeanine, right?
[02:26:49.573 --> 02:26:52.113]  But they called you and I crazy, right?
[02:26:52.153 --> 02:26:55.894]  They said, oh, Laura Loomer and Alex Jones, they're conspiracy wackos.
[02:26:55.934 --> 02:26:56.694]  She's a racist.
[02:26:56.734 --> 02:26:58.054]  She hates Muslims, right?
[02:26:58.074 --> 02:26:59.095]  That's what they said about us.
[02:26:59.735 --> 02:27:01.995]  But now they're coming for the more mainstream people.
[02:27:02.015 --> 02:27:03.535]  And by the way, there's still no word.
[02:27:03.555 --> 02:27:05.096]  She didn't show up for her show.
[02:27:05.316 --> 02:27:06.916]  Is she just suspended or is she banned?
[02:27:08.484 --> 02:27:08.985]  I don't know.
[02:27:23.724 --> 02:27:24.505]  No, I agree.
[02:27:24.545 --> 02:27:26.667]  Let's talk about that all, but let's talk about you.
[02:27:26.767 --> 02:27:27.427]  Let's talk about you.
[02:27:27.447 --> 02:27:31.350]  I tried to find out who started hashtag StopTheBias.
[02:27:31.371 --> 02:27:32.692]  You were the first person I ever heard.
[02:27:33.012 --> 02:27:33.893]  You sent me a hat.
[02:27:33.933 --> 02:27:34.913]  You handed the hats out.
[02:27:35.334 --> 02:27:36.695]  You asked me to get behind it months ago.
[02:27:36.815 --> 02:27:39.077]  Are you the progenitor of StopTheBias?
[02:27:39.097 --> 02:27:40.278]  Because the president's endorsing that.
[02:27:41.755 --> 02:27:42.655]  Yeah, I believe so.
[02:27:42.735 --> 02:27:49.418]  I mean, you can see in my video that when I confronted Jack Dorsey, I shouted, stop the bias.
[02:27:49.578 --> 02:27:52.619]  And that's really when it became a massive trend.
[02:27:52.759 --> 02:27:56.721]  So I would say that I am the person who made stop the bias mainstream.
[02:27:56.761 --> 02:27:57.321]  That's correct.
[02:27:57.841 --> 02:28:00.402]  President Trump did tweet my hashtag yesterday.
[02:28:00.962 --> 02:28:03.904]  And also, we've got Oliver Darcy, you confronted.
[02:28:04.104 --> 02:28:05.304]  We've got Oliver Darcy.
[02:28:06.164 --> 02:28:06.405]  Yeah.
[02:28:07.985 --> 02:28:09.706]  Boy, is he not a little slimy creature?
[02:28:10.999 --> 02:28:11.660]  Oh no, he is.
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:13.862]  He's a terrible individual.
[02:28:13.902 --> 02:28:17.145]  And look, Oliver Darcy is just really jealous, right?
[02:28:17.245 --> 02:28:19.007]  Oliver Darcy used to be a conservative.
[02:28:19.047 --> 02:28:25.693]  You know, James O'Keefe was telling me that Oliver Darcy used to send him text messages, and I hope O'Keefe will be okay with me saying this on air.
[02:28:26.073 --> 02:28:39.623]  But Oliver Darcy used to, like, message James O'Keefe about how he wanted a job at Veritas and how he used to do these affirmative action bake sales to try to seem edgy, you know, when he was in the conservative clubs in college.
[02:28:40.043 --> 02:28:44.666]  And I know that he wanted a job at InfoWars, too, but you and O'Keefe both turned him down.
[02:28:44.686 --> 02:28:45.847]  You know, I forgot that.
[02:28:45.887 --> 02:28:48.349]  I forgot Darcy did ask for a job here, like, five years ago.
[02:28:48.809 --> 02:28:50.030]  He's probably infiltrating, though.
[02:28:50.050 --> 02:28:51.211]  I think he's been an operative from the beginning.
[02:28:51.431 --> 02:28:52.571]  Laura, you are awesome.
[02:28:52.611 --> 02:28:52.992]  Stay there.
[02:28:53.032 --> 02:28:53.952]  Tell us what's coming next.
[02:28:54.292 --> 02:28:56.053]  Laura Loomer, she's taking action.
[02:28:56.373 --> 02:28:57.854]  More than 10,000 men are.
[02:28:58.194 --> 02:28:59.374]  So where are the men in this country?
[02:28:59.414 --> 02:29:00.055]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:02.696 --> 02:29:07.638]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[02:29:07.778 --> 02:29:10.699]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.
[02:29:10.719 --> 02:29:12.660]  This is the best deal we've ever offered.
[02:29:13.300 --> 02:29:14.560]  Free shipping storewide.
[02:29:14.901 --> 02:29:16.321]  That's free shipping storewide.
[02:29:16.761 --> 02:29:18.002]  Free shipping storewide.
[02:29:18.642 --> 02:29:20.043]  50% off all the supplements.
[02:29:20.183 --> 02:29:22.163]  A bunch of other great deals as well.
[02:29:22.383 --> 02:29:23.443]  Double Patriot points.

[02:29:39.888 --> 02:29:42.269]  Most of these products are loss leaders.
[02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:43.870]  I cannot believe we even produced this.
[02:29:43.890 --> 02:29:45.311]  I mean, this, this, this is insane.
[02:29:45.331 --> 02:29:46.032]  I said, I'm a game changer.
[02:29:46.132 --> 02:29:46.412]  I'm a guru.
[02:30:15.578 --> 02:30:19.221]  Activists and other people aren't willing to do it.
[02:30:19.321 --> 02:30:22.524]  And I'll tell you right now, I'm here to ram heads with you!
[02:30:22.544 --> 02:30:26.767]  As soon as you drink, you're bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[02:30:26.827 --> 02:30:28.289]  Well, it's not me, it's you.
[02:30:28.309 --> 02:30:30.771]  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[02:30:30.831 --> 02:30:32.252]  Gosh, it's bad.
[02:30:32.452 --> 02:30:34.774]  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[02:30:35.054 --> 02:30:36.355]  Now, did you hear what I just said?
[02:30:36.455 --> 02:30:39.718]  Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[02:30:40.399 --> 02:30:41.379]  It's bad.
[02:30:41.760 --> 02:30:42.240]  Workout.
[02:30:42.520 --> 02:30:44.342]  So let me just workout.

[02:32:04.113 --> 02:32:13.555]  We're going to do, this Thursday through Friday through Saturday, a 50-hour emergency Save the First Amendment broadcast with a bunch of special guests and a bunch of stuff we've never done before.
[02:32:13.676 --> 02:32:14.816]  Believe me, this is going to be special.
[02:32:14.916 --> 02:32:15.776]  Thursday 8 a.m.
[02:32:15.796 --> 02:32:19.377]  with David Knight, right through Saturday 10 a.m., 50 hours, a bunch of special guests.
[02:32:19.497 --> 02:32:25.439]  We're going to blur out the violence, but we're going to look at all the anomalies, not even saying there's anomalies.
[02:32:25.659 --> 02:32:26.839]  We have a right to.
[02:32:27.219 --> 02:32:27.759]  Bill Johnson?
[02:32:27.919 --> 02:32:29.260]  No, I completely agree with you.
[02:32:29.600 --> 02:32:32.941]  And it should be done, because the liberal media, they're not going to show any of that.
[02:32:33.001 --> 02:32:34.222]  They're not going to talk about that.
[02:32:34.342 --> 02:32:38.143]  They want to push this narrative again, that it's white supremacy.
[02:32:38.163 --> 02:32:43.005]  And even when you read through all the information, he doesn't look like he's a white supremacy.
[02:32:43.065 --> 02:32:44.946]  He's completely for the Green Deal.
[02:32:45.046 --> 02:32:50.568]  He's against President Trump, but yet you have the media, even Fox News, pushing that he's a white supremacist.
[02:32:50.628 --> 02:32:50.888]  Why?
[02:32:51.048 --> 02:32:53.929]  Because all racist roads lead to white people.
[02:32:54.449 --> 02:32:55.411]  I mean it's sickening.
[02:32:55.731 --> 02:33:00.437]  The truth is governments do do stuff like this and it's legitimate for anybody to ask those type of questions.
[02:33:06.265 --> 02:33:08.909]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:31.147 --> 02:33:32.628]  Burning inside your freedom.
[02:33:33.388 --> 02:33:34.388]  The right to self-defense.
[02:33:34.789 --> 02:33:35.409]  The right to profit.
[02:33:35.429 --> 02:33:36.189]  The right to speech.
[02:33:36.229 --> 02:33:36.909]  The right to life.
[02:33:37.210 --> 02:33:38.450]  The right to defend yourself.
[02:33:39.450 --> 02:33:44.553]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:45.933 --> 02:33:47.894]  What we are looking at is good.
[02:33:56.480 --> 02:34:00.623]  They have to tie our hands, they have to suppress us, because we carry the truth.
[02:34:01.423 --> 02:34:03.645]  The light and the dark of the night, and they can't suppress us.
[02:34:04.545 --> 02:34:11.370]  All we have to do is persevere, like George Washington, losing almost every battle, but in the end, wending the war.
[02:34:12.650 --> 02:34:13.751]  Resistance is victory.
[02:34:14.912 --> 02:34:15.752]  Nothing can stop you.
[02:34:16.873 --> 02:34:21.336]  As long as you know that plowing forward's the answer.
[02:34:22.540 --> 02:34:24.903]  Because submission is unto death.
[02:34:25.904 --> 02:34:26.504]  It's like death.
[02:34:28.086 --> 02:34:34.774]  Laura Loomer is the person that created hashtag stop the bias that President Trump now says he's getting behind.
[02:34:36.021 --> 02:34:41.084]  And we're turning the tide, forcing a debate on this, forcing out the lobbyists in D.C.
[02:34:41.144 --> 02:34:42.665]  that are trying to lie to the President and others.
[02:34:43.205 --> 02:34:51.930]  And Laura Loomer was right there with me, taking over that committee hearing meeting and having that stupid Congressman like Porky Pig do his auctioneering.
[02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:52.331]  Remember that?
[02:34:53.591 --> 02:34:55.392]  The media cut her audio out and only played that.
[02:34:55.432 --> 02:35:00.976]  But here's what the woman who launched the Stop the Bias movement, who trends number one on Twitter routinely,
[02:35:01.616 --> 02:35:08.682]  Steadfastly, she kept fighting, and here she is, back on September 5th, 2018, launching this movement.
[02:35:11.985 --> 02:35:14.727]  Mr. Dorsey, you are lying about censoring conservatives.
[02:35:14.767 --> 02:35:17.029]  You are caught on tape by Project Veritas.
[02:35:17.370 --> 02:35:18.370]  Shadowbanning people.
[02:35:18.651 --> 02:35:19.652]  You are censoring people.
[02:35:19.692 --> 02:35:20.452]  You censored me.
[02:35:20.492 --> 02:35:21.513]  You censored my life.
[02:35:21.533 --> 02:35:23.815]  You censored Chuck Johnson, James O'Keefe.
[02:35:23.835 --> 02:35:28.099]  You even censored President Trump when one of your employees deleted his account for a few minutes.
[02:35:28.519 --> 02:35:32.420]  You are censoring conservatives, and I'm asking you, President Donald Trump, help us.
[02:35:32.780 --> 02:35:42.722]  Please help us, Mr. President, before it is too late, because Jack Dorsey is trying to influence the election, to sway the election so that the Democrats can steal the election.
[02:35:43.082 --> 02:35:46.402]  That is why he is censoring and shadow banning conservatives.
[02:35:46.943 --> 02:35:48.963]  You are a liar, Jack Dorsey.
[02:35:49.003 --> 02:35:50.443]  You are a liar, Jack Dorsey.
[02:35:50.463 --> 02:35:52.063]  You unverified me on November 15, 2017.
[02:35:54.964 --> 02:36:00.687]  Officer, will you escort this young lady out, please?
[02:36:00.847 --> 02:36:01.748]  Stop the bias!
[02:36:01.828 --> 02:36:07.070]  We are conservative Americans, not Russian bots, Jack Dorsey!
[02:36:07.410 --> 02:36:09.712]  Stop the bias!
[02:36:09.732 --> 02:36:14.114]  So, from the wilderness, to the front lines, Laura Loomer...
[02:36:15.071 --> 02:36:15.551]  Right there.
[02:36:15.651 --> 02:36:22.935]  And then I'm going to get Laura's take on this and where she's going with this now and all the exploits she's already engaged in because of her will to take action.
[02:36:22.955 --> 02:36:25.537]  Then I want to give you the worst news yet on censorship.
[02:36:25.917 --> 02:36:28.018]  The next level has begun globally.
[02:36:28.319 --> 02:36:29.879]  The banning of URLs.
[02:36:30.580 --> 02:36:31.440]  Not in China.
[02:36:33.541 --> 02:36:34.282]  Not in China.
[02:36:36.479 --> 02:36:40.921]  But in the United States and in Europe and in New Zealand, wait till you hear who they just banned.
[02:36:41.241 --> 02:36:43.703]  Story just went live on InfoWars.com, but I'll get to it in a moment.
[02:36:44.003 --> 02:36:50.666]  Laura Loomer, continue now with your charting history here as a trailblazer, being laughed at at the time, trending on Twitter.
[02:36:50.686 --> 02:36:51.766]  They all laughed at you.
[02:36:51.987 --> 02:36:52.807]  Ha ha ha!
[02:36:53.027 --> 02:37:00.951]  They laughed at all the other events as if their mockery did anything, and now the President and Congress are getting ready to take action with the hashtag you created.
[02:37:02.185 --> 02:37:17.449]  Yeah, it's great, you know, and look, I continue to still be ostracized and a lot of people keep distance from me because the left has branded me, right, as this kind of like neo-Nazi white supremacist radical, even though my ideas are pretty mainstream.
[02:37:18.090 --> 02:37:19.610]  But, you know, I'm going to keep on fighting.
[02:37:19.630 --> 02:37:22.451]  These people have tried to destroy my livelihood.
[02:37:22.751 --> 02:37:26.352]  They've banned me on PayPal, but we have to keep fighting, you know, and they want you to
[02:37:26.932 --> 02:37:27.593]  We're good to go.
[02:37:44.748 --> 02:37:46.189]  And I'm here in California.
[02:37:46.349 --> 02:37:47.649]  I am tracking these people.
[02:37:47.809 --> 02:37:50.490]  I am keeping tabs on these executives.
[02:37:50.710 --> 02:37:55.992]  I have a network of investigators that I have deployed across the country to keep tabs on these people.
[02:37:56.312 --> 02:38:05.715]  And, you know, I got my career started at Project Veritas, and, you know, you've shown a lot of my undercover work from my time at Veritas, and I'm planning on going undercover again.
[02:38:06.195 --> 02:38:18.444]  So stay tuned, because I'm taking it to the next level, and then I'm going to use my skill set from being undercover to expose more of this evil that we're seeing and this injustice that's taken place.
[02:38:18.524 --> 02:38:19.905]  But we all have to stick together.
[02:38:20.265 --> 02:38:25.749]  And, you know, a lot of people have thrown you under the bus, Alex, but, you know, I think you're a goddamn hero, and I plan
[02:38:26.970 --> 02:38:36.637]  Laura, you're a libertarian conservative.
[02:38:36.937 --> 02:38:37.598]  You're Jewish.
[02:38:37.638 --> 02:38:38.358]  You're pro-Israel.
[02:38:38.378 --> 02:38:42.602]  When they call you a white supremacist in national news, it shows that they are the joke.
[02:38:42.922 --> 02:38:45.624]  They're the ones that are Soros-funded, a literal Nazi collaborator.
[02:38:46.004 --> 02:38:47.586]  They're now calling Joe Rogan
[02:38:48.266 --> 02:38:53.711]  For having myself and other people on a far-right person that it supports, Richard Spencer.
[02:38:54.091 --> 02:38:55.652]  Joe is very liberal socially.
[02:38:55.692 --> 02:38:56.693]  That is a total lie.
[02:38:56.713 --> 02:39:00.056]  And I'm not going to get into his private life, but Joe is not a racist.
[02:39:00.316 --> 02:39:04.400]  And you know, I've had my problems with Joe, but he's now going up against the censorship and I appreciate that.
[02:39:04.420 --> 02:39:10.505]  We're going to be hanging out this weekend together and having dinner, but I mean, it's just the idea to call him a white supremacist.
[02:39:10.985 --> 02:39:11.826]  Tell him to have me on.
[02:39:11.846 --> 02:39:11.986]  I will.
[02:39:12.006 --> 02:39:13.948]  He won't have me on, but he needs to have me on.
[02:39:13.968 --> 02:39:21.455]  I don't know what his problem is, but he's always talking about me, and you know, he's called me a crazy lunatic on his show, and I am far from a crazy lunatic.
[02:39:21.555 --> 02:39:22.556]  I am ahead of the curve.
[02:39:23.077 --> 02:39:25.439]  I am always breaking stories before anybody else.
[02:39:25.459 --> 02:39:25.960]  No, I know.
[02:39:25.980 --> 02:39:27.581]  Joe was kind of getting off the reservation.
[02:39:28.482 --> 02:39:29.742]  And he's kind of woken up now.
[02:39:30.462 --> 02:39:32.323]  I'm not going to speak for Joe.
[02:39:32.363 --> 02:39:35.083]  He's just trying to be an entertainer and live his own life.
[02:39:35.143 --> 02:39:38.904]  And I get that, but I'm glad he's... I will definitely say he should have Laura Limer on.
[02:39:39.324 --> 02:39:43.405]  One thing Joe hates is being told who he should have on, but you're absolutely right, Laura.
[02:39:43.445 --> 02:39:44.085]  He should have you on.
[02:39:44.105 --> 02:39:44.846]  That's a smart interview.
[02:39:45.046 --> 02:39:51.067]  Hell, the president just tweeted you and said he's going to get behind and hashtag stop the bias.
[02:39:51.407 --> 02:39:56.108]  How angry, Laura, is Twitter that since they banned you, you're bigger than ever like Obi-Wan Kenobi?
[02:39:57.557 --> 02:39:58.818]  Yeah, I mean, that's what happens.
[02:39:58.878 --> 02:39:59.778]  You know, it's the same with you.
[02:39:59.818 --> 02:40:04.760]  I think they're pretty pissed and, uh, you know, Jack Dorsey keeps getting asked about me in interviews.
[02:40:04.780 --> 02:40:17.946]  The Rolling Stone actually sat down with him and they asked him about me and he had no other choice but to say that he respects me and he thinks I'm, like, punk rock and that he thinks that protest is cool and that he admires my drive.
[02:40:17.966 --> 02:40:20.207]  Then why the hell you didn't do anything to get banned?
[02:40:20.267 --> 02:40:20.948]  Put you back?
[02:40:20.988 --> 02:40:21.548]  Exactly.
[02:40:22.088 --> 02:40:23.409]  Tell them what they claim you did.
[02:40:24.747 --> 02:40:31.071]  Well, they claimed that I committed hate speech because I said that Ilhan Omar was anti-Jewish and pro-Sharia.
[02:40:31.411 --> 02:40:36.795]  And if you recall... And by the way, you said that before anybody had a... And she also is for pro-cutting genitals off.
[02:40:37.055 --> 02:40:39.737]  So that's pretty feminist to not want your genitals cut off, right?
[02:40:40.620 --> 02:40:43.981]  Right, and like I said, I was the first to really start talking about Yohan.
[02:40:44.041 --> 02:40:51.524]  I'm the only person on this planet who confronted her to her face, along with Rashida Tlaib, about their Jew hatred and support for Hamas.
[02:40:52.004 --> 02:40:52.245]  Right?
[02:40:52.565 --> 02:40:55.746]  When she was running, you went and covered her as a reporter.
[02:40:55.766 --> 02:40:58.047]  We're very polite, but they called you a stalker in the media.
[02:40:59.798 --> 02:41:00.899]  Yeah, no, exactly.
[02:41:00.939 --> 02:41:15.185]  And people didn't want to listen, but now everybody wants to jump on the, oh my God, Ilhan's a jihadist train, but they should have really been paying attention to the reports that, you know, I was reporting, that you were reporting on, and they could have avoided this whole entire situation.
[02:41:15.505 --> 02:41:16.565]  But now we have a woman.
[02:41:16.585 --> 02:41:17.146]  Did you see this?
[02:41:17.166 --> 02:41:17.646]  Did you see that?
[02:41:17.726 --> 02:41:20.067]  Ilhan Omar last year, he met with Erdogan.
[02:41:20.567 --> 02:41:23.390]  Erdogan, okay, we're talking about Muslim Brotherhood Central.
[02:41:23.410 --> 02:41:24.691]  She's backed by CARE.
[02:41:24.811 --> 02:41:34.420]  And let's be clear, Erdogan said we're gonna send New Zealanders and people back in massive body bags as if New Zealand is all guilty for what happened.
[02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:35.861]  That's how sick that is.
[02:41:36.986 --> 02:41:37.386]  Erdogan
[02:42:06.886 --> 02:42:07.126]  No, I agree.
[02:42:07.146 --> 02:42:07.907]  And you can tell her IQ is like 75.
[02:42:07.947 --> 02:42:09.847]  I mean, she can't stop spewing her hate.
[02:42:27.356 --> 02:42:28.937]  She is a... Well, she's still Molly.
[02:42:28.957 --> 02:42:29.958]  She's still Molly.
[02:42:29.998 --> 02:42:34.521]  And I mean, that also goes back to, you know, this whole concept of inbreeding and incest as well.
[02:42:34.581 --> 02:42:40.846]  But, you know, there's a lot of IQ politics and scientific research to explain why she is the way she is.
[02:42:40.946 --> 02:42:43.568]  But, I mean, that's another... We could talk about that for hours.
[02:42:43.588 --> 02:42:45.169]  Well, I just know she's a raging lunatic.
[02:42:45.649 --> 02:42:53.835]  And she just met with Erdogan, who said he's going to Islamify the world, we'll all submit by the sword, and he wants to kill everybody in New Zealand now.
[02:42:54.215 --> 02:42:55.716]  And the whole leftist media covers it up.
[02:42:56.317 --> 02:43:00.119]  Laura Loomer, changing the world, straight ahead on Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:01.781]  We'll tell you her site when we come back.
[02:43:04.739 --> 02:43:12.709]  Thursday, March 21st, InfoWars is going to launch our longest continual broadcast for 50 hours.
[02:43:12.729 --> 02:43:20.899]  An emergency summit with the most powerful, informed guests out there on developing a plan of action.
[02:43:21.618 --> 02:43:29.923]  To stop Big Tech, the Democratic Party and others working with the UN and the EU from crushing our free speech collectively.
[02:43:30.424 --> 02:43:32.405]  We're going to show the history of censorship.
[02:43:32.885 --> 02:43:39.009]  It was also CNN that demanded that radio show host Alex Jones be silenced because Jeff Zucker didn't like what he was saying.
[02:43:39.329 --> 02:43:43.092]  CNN really must think we're all idiots giving themselves an award last week.
[02:43:43.533 --> 02:43:46.075]  CNN waged a long campaign against Jones.
[02:43:46.195 --> 02:43:46.735]  It worked.
[02:43:47.176 --> 02:43:49.838]  Jeff Zucker's silence and deep platformed his show.
[02:43:50.038 --> 02:43:52.300]  It was a stunning defeat for free speech.
[02:43:52.681 --> 02:43:55.843]  So naturally, Jeff Zucker just won the First Amendment award.
[02:43:56.884 --> 02:43:58.366]  It kicks off 8 a.m.
[02:43:58.687 --> 02:44:02.371]  with the David Knight Show this Thursday and runs till 10 a.m.
[02:44:02.792 --> 02:44:04.554]  live that Saturday.
[02:44:04.875 --> 02:44:06.697]  We're gonna have a bunch of surprise guests.
[02:44:06.717 --> 02:44:10.502]  We're gonna have Ask Me Anything special events, roundtable discussions.
[02:44:10.863 --> 02:44:12.224]  This is gonna be our most important
[02:44:12.965 --> 02:44:15.467]  24-hour plus transmission ever.
[02:44:15.948 --> 02:44:18.670]  So please tune in and get past the censors.
[02:44:19.250 --> 02:44:24.295]  Tell everybody about the links at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:44:25.095 --> 02:44:32.161]  InfoWars was supposed to already be shut down and gone, but thanks to you in many ways we're stronger than ever.
[02:44:32.822 --> 02:44:34.623]  Make no mistake, the fight is on.
[02:44:35.544 --> 02:44:41.365]  InfoWars is the test case, and if they can shut us down, they're gonna shut everything down.
[02:44:41.445 --> 02:44:48.406]  Join us this Thursday, 8am, and spread the word, because you are the voice of the people.
[02:44:48.926 --> 02:44:50.287]  You can override the censors.
[02:44:50.907 --> 02:44:52.227]  You are the resistance.
[02:45:02.929 --> 02:45:03.969]  The good news is,
[02:45:05.470 --> 02:45:14.216]  After a year and a half long battle to secure the deep-earth crystals that nobody else has for the purest atomic iodine out there, we have been able to secure X2.
[02:45:15.937 --> 02:45:17.438]  I was sure we weren't going to be able to get it.
[02:45:17.798 --> 02:45:20.560]  It's a derivative that the oil companies get between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[02:45:21.060 --> 02:45:32.188]  There's globalist industrial espionage that goes on where they try to not just take our sponsors and things, but actually stop us from getting the raw material because this is under DEA control to get the raw stuff because it's so powerful.
[02:45:32.748 --> 02:45:34.990]  So X2, after being sold out for several months,
[02:45:36.070 --> 02:45:40.272]  We were able to get it back into production from its original producer, and we now have it.
[02:45:40.652 --> 02:45:43.853]  And it is the purest, best, good halogen out there.
[02:45:44.294 --> 02:45:49.476]  Just research how IQs went down massively in the Midwest because they didn't have any iodine in the soil.
[02:45:49.876 --> 02:45:53.877]  Once the government added it, it just did all of these insanely good things.
[02:45:54.178 --> 02:45:54.678]  Research.
[02:45:55.378 --> 02:45:55.918]  It's incredible.
[02:45:56.158 --> 02:45:57.019]  One of God's great gifts.
[02:45:57.759 --> 02:45:58.599]  So, X2's back.
[02:45:58.740 --> 02:45:59.740]  It's in about a week and a half.
[02:45:59.780 --> 02:46:01.321]  You can pre-order at InfoWarshore.com.
[02:46:01.341 --> 02:46:02.942]  I almost forgot.
[02:46:03.182 --> 02:46:06.183]  25% off out of the gates to celebrate the fact that it's back.
[02:46:06.223 --> 02:46:07.584]  I forgot that part.
[02:46:07.604 --> 02:46:08.144]  25% off X2.
[02:46:08.384 --> 02:46:11.286]  A lot of you have experienced it.
[02:46:11.306 --> 02:46:11.786]  You've loved it.
[02:46:11.846 --> 02:46:12.507]  A lot of you haven't.
[02:46:12.887 --> 02:46:13.387]  Try it out.
[02:46:13.427 --> 02:46:14.147]  Fund the operation.
[02:46:14.768 --> 02:46:16.769]  The bad news is, outside of our audience...
[02:46:17.589 --> 02:46:24.131]  People don't know that Iodine is needed for electrochemical activity in the brain, or for your hormones, or for everything that happens in your body.
[02:46:24.511 --> 02:46:28.572]  And if you don't have it, you absorb the bad allergens like Chlorine and Fluoride and other things.
[02:46:29.453 --> 02:46:32.754]  So get your X2 original today and share it with people.
[02:46:33.174 --> 02:46:35.395]  Tell them about the Iodine conspiracy.
[02:46:35.735 --> 02:46:38.115]  Because the bad news is a lot of people don't know.
[02:46:38.135 --> 02:46:38.155]  X2.
[02:46:40.828 --> 02:46:42.469]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:27.071 --> 02:47:27.972]  You've found it.
[02:47:28.312 --> 02:47:29.813]  The tip of the spear.
[02:47:30.313 --> 02:47:32.755]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:39.679 --> 02:47:43.562]  And that's the thing.
[02:47:44.342 --> 02:47:45.623]  You have to find InfoWars.
[02:47:47.704 --> 02:47:49.946]  And it's our listeners and the ambassadors.
[02:47:50.868 --> 02:47:55.170]  You carry the ball forward, but you notice every guess we have, everything we do is about action.
[02:47:55.630 --> 02:47:56.551]  It's about victory.
[02:47:57.891 --> 02:47:59.692]  Massive lawsuits for the Covington kids.
[02:47:59.872 --> 02:48:00.713]  Had the lawyer on.
[02:48:01.333 --> 02:48:02.994]  Massive movements to defend free speech.
[02:48:03.074 --> 02:48:03.854]  Crushed the globalists.
[02:48:03.914 --> 02:48:04.894]  Got Laura Loomer on.
[02:48:05.535 --> 02:48:07.956]  Everything we do is about action.
[02:48:08.336 --> 02:48:09.196]  About delivering.
[02:48:09.877 --> 02:48:10.577]  Not just talk.
[02:48:11.538 --> 02:48:15.459]  The enemy can track almost all their defeats right back through this show.
[02:48:15.539 --> 02:48:16.300]  Not that we did it.
[02:48:17.304 --> 02:48:17.464]  I'm
[02:48:37.432 --> 02:48:44.956]  The snow melts in the spring, and then the rivers that come out of it, and they keep trying to shut it down, but they can't because of you.
[02:48:45.896 --> 02:48:46.717]  And that isn't talk.
[02:48:46.777 --> 02:48:48.397]  That's the epic thing that's happening.
[02:48:49.478 --> 02:48:50.238]  Here's the bad news.
[02:48:52.440 --> 02:48:53.000]  And the good news.
[02:48:53.020 --> 02:48:55.101]  Because everything's double-sided.
[02:48:56.451 --> 02:49:00.992]  The globalists are completely desperate because everything they've done is failing.
[02:49:01.052 --> 02:49:06.033]  Nationalism, populism, free market, love of the family is exploding again.
[02:49:06.473 --> 02:49:09.434]  Everything that's globalist is losing 30-40% of its ratings.
[02:49:09.994 --> 02:49:11.054]  Hollywood, the NFL.
[02:49:13.275 --> 02:49:15.135]  Everything the globalists touch is falling apart.
[02:49:15.215 --> 02:49:17.796]  They admit in their own internal documents they're done.
[02:49:20.367 --> 02:49:28.090]  They just want to wreck things and make the fall of civilization so bad and the fall of America so incredible that somehow they get forgotten.
[02:49:28.350 --> 02:49:29.170]  It's not going to happen.
[02:49:31.711 --> 02:49:39.794]  But obviously, and I've talked to a lot of high-level folks in IT, the next move is URL banning and then IP address banning.
[02:49:43.575 --> 02:49:44.816]  That's where all this is going.
[02:49:45.572 --> 02:49:47.833]  Because they thought demonetize people, they'll roll over.
[02:49:48.253 --> 02:49:49.594]  Okay, censor them, they'll roll over.
[02:49:49.674 --> 02:49:50.674]  Well, this is Pavlovian.
[02:49:51.034 --> 02:49:53.135]  They're not giving in to the conditioning.
[02:49:53.775 --> 02:49:54.876]  They're not submitting.
[02:49:55.976 --> 02:49:57.257]  What are we going to do?
[02:49:59.117 --> 02:50:00.478]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:50:00.838 --> 02:50:05.840]  We've got NewsWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and a bunch of other sites we're affiliated with, but we don't run.
[02:50:05.860 --> 02:50:11.182]  We're going to be launching the next few weeks so that our content's there and it's free to air everywhere.
[02:50:12.264 --> 02:50:17.966]  We have to create a gnome-de-plume where the name Alex Jones is being banned everywhere, so we'll have to call it something else.
[02:50:18.026 --> 02:50:20.606]  Maybe the new code name will be Rex Jones, and they'll ban that.
[02:50:20.946 --> 02:50:24.367]  By the time they ban that, we create something new like Spartacus Jones.
[02:50:24.767 --> 02:50:25.268]  Who knows?
[02:50:25.728 --> 02:50:30.489]  But this is the game now, where people aren't just going to get direct access to the Veritas.
[02:50:30.509 --> 02:50:31.509]  It's going to be blocked.
[02:50:31.809 --> 02:50:37.551]  But humans, once they figure out something's being kept, that's the big gamble of the globalists.
[02:50:37.571 --> 02:50:38.431]  They think you're stupid.
[02:50:38.451 --> 02:50:40.292]  They think you're in such a daze, you won't look for the truth.
[02:50:40.332 --> 02:50:40.852]  You're going to look.
[02:50:41.493 --> 02:50:42.153]  But here's the bad news.
[02:50:42.173 --> 02:50:43.354]  Let me get Laura Loomer's take on this.
[02:50:44.054 --> 02:50:57.241]  After blocking Zero Hedge and others, New Zealand telcos demand big tech censorship surge to protect consumers and begin blocking zerohedge.com.
[02:50:57.261 --> 02:50:59.883]  Because I've told you, I don't know the Zero Hedge people.
[02:50:59.903 --> 02:51:01.364]  I'm not affiliated with them.
[02:51:02.864 --> 02:51:05.466]  I just know it's some of the most piercing, deep reporting.
[02:51:05.846 --> 02:51:07.727]  They must have some of the same sources we have.
[02:51:10.353 --> 02:51:12.474]  And the story is red-linked on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:51:15.575 --> 02:51:20.837]  And I should add, DrudgeReport.com is linked to our posting of Zero Hedge.
[02:51:22.457 --> 02:51:27.959]  So that's where this is going, is URL and then IP address level.
[02:51:30.360 --> 02:51:33.141]  They don't censor Laura Lemmer because she's bad.
[02:51:34.346 --> 02:51:36.808]  They don't censor Zero Hedge because they're lying.
[02:51:37.329 --> 02:51:41.392]  They don't demonize Drudge Report constantly because he's telling people lies.
[02:51:41.452 --> 02:51:42.733]  No, it's because they're jealous.
[02:51:43.774 --> 02:51:45.095]  Most of the traffic they get is off drugs.
[02:51:45.115 --> 02:51:48.178]  They admit like half the traffic of their time is off drugs, and they want drugs shut down.
[02:51:48.398 --> 02:51:49.319]  These are crazy people!
[02:51:50.902 --> 02:51:54.843]  I wish Drudge Link tapped as much to me as he did to the New York Times or the Washington Poster.
[02:51:56.043 --> 02:51:56.583]  CNN.
[02:51:57.103 --> 02:52:00.484]  So after blocking Zero, does Drudge get hate from me?
[02:52:00.564 --> 02:52:01.784]  No, no, because Drudge is great.
[02:52:02.044 --> 02:52:03.865]  They just hate, hate, hate.
[02:52:04.545 --> 02:52:06.045]  It's the entitlement of these people.
[02:52:07.025 --> 02:52:13.746]  After blocking Zero, Hedge and others, New Zealand telcos demand big tech censorship surge to protect consumers.
[02:52:14.407 --> 02:52:16.207]  Because you can't decide what you're watching.
[02:52:17.287 --> 02:52:20.009]  And they go on and lie and say that we're denying the shooting happened.
[02:52:20.210 --> 02:52:20.710]  Never said it.
[02:52:21.571 --> 02:52:22.351]  The guy's a monster.
[02:52:22.371 --> 02:52:23.092]  We believe it happened.
[02:52:23.753 --> 02:52:32.760]  We just played Rush Limbaugh saying it could be a false flag by a leftist to do it to blame conservatives, which he says in the manifesto he's trying to cause a race war like Charlie Manson.
[02:52:33.621 --> 02:52:38.866]  We're just having a real discussion, not white people did it, whites are evil, race war.
[02:52:39.286 --> 02:52:39.406]  CNN.
[02:52:40.854 --> 02:53:05.541]  In the wake of last week's terror attacks at two New Zealand mosques, which left 50 dead, several websites which either reported the incident, hosted footage of the attacks, have simply allowed people to engage in uncensored discussions such as Dissenter or Zero Hedge, have been partly or completely blocked by both New Zealand and Australia to the sake of protecting consumers, according to CEOs of three New Zealand telcos, working in censorship tandem.
[02:53:05.981 --> 02:53:08.182]  You thought it was just Big Tech banning me and One Day Together?
[02:53:08.262 --> 02:53:09.202]  This is a practice run.
[02:53:10.580 --> 02:53:13.103]  And it goes into it and Facebook brags about it, all of them.
[02:53:13.824 --> 02:53:18.609]  And then here's the thing, once they took Zero Hedge down, they went, Zero Hedge says no one died.
[02:53:18.809 --> 02:53:20.451]  Zero Hedge didn't say that, you liars.
[02:53:20.772 --> 02:53:21.513]  Same thing with me.
[02:53:21.993 --> 02:53:25.557]  Jones is being taken off YouTube, anywhere he is, because he says no one dies.
[02:53:26.118 --> 02:53:26.759]  Show the video!
[02:53:29.744 --> 02:53:41.811]  In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, which was broadcast over Facebook Live, I accused gunman Brenton Tarrant to an initial audience of 200 million viewers, none of whom reported it, and have 4,000 overall views before it was taken down.
[02:53:42.131 --> 02:53:48.014]  Facebook deleted 1.5 million videos of the attack, which 1.2 million were blocked at the time of upload.
[02:53:48.034 --> 02:53:49.575]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:53:49.635 --> 02:53:50.296]  They're okay.
[02:53:50.596 --> 02:53:51.756]  Zero Hedge is bad.
[02:53:52.437 --> 02:53:53.657]  And then it goes into IP.
[02:53:55.034 --> 02:53:57.296]  is going to be the next, but right now it's URLs.
[02:53:58.036 --> 02:54:06.783]  Laura, I know you've got several websites, speaking of the devil, we always say, oh, we've been censored off the big tech platforms, YouTube, Google, Facebook, Twitter, come to our websites.
[02:54:07.123 --> 02:54:09.985]  But they're trying to take our servers.
[02:54:10.005 --> 02:54:11.226]  They're trying to take our bank accounts.
[02:54:11.506 --> 02:54:12.547]  I know they've done that to you.
[02:54:12.847 --> 02:54:15.009]  So where can people find you, at least for now?
[02:54:15.069 --> 02:54:16.730]  Is it lauraloomer.us?
[02:54:16.750 --> 02:54:17.411]  Where's the best place?
[02:54:17.791 --> 02:54:18.531]  Yeah, it's Laura.
[02:54:18.652 --> 02:54:25.976]  It's lauralumar.us, and you can subscribe to my email list because I send out emails every week, and that's where people can get my information.
[02:54:26.016 --> 02:54:29.998]  I'm also still on Instagram, so my handle's lumared.
[02:54:30.578 --> 02:54:33.720]  Instagram censors me, too, but I've been telling people to follow me there.
[02:54:33.820 --> 02:54:35.661]  But, yeah, no, you're right.
[02:54:35.701 --> 02:54:38.583]  I mean, this is exactly what they want to do.
[02:54:38.703 --> 02:54:46.307]  And I can see in the future, I can definitely see, like, the less now that they see how this guy, like, look at this guy who shot at the mosque, right?
[02:54:47.443 --> 02:54:49.947]  He wasn't even really a Trump supporter.
[02:54:49.967 --> 02:54:54.594]  He, if you look at his manifesto, is a communist, right?
[02:54:54.614 --> 02:54:56.036]  Like he's a godless communist.
[02:54:56.277 --> 02:54:59.422]  And a lot of the stuff that he was saying in there is just kind of...
[02:55:00.143 --> 02:55:01.344]  Uh, troll-like, right?
[02:55:01.424 --> 02:55:07.449]  I mean, saying that he believes in white supremacy, but then saying, you know, he was inspired by Candace Owens.
[02:55:07.469 --> 02:55:08.390]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[02:55:08.450 --> 02:55:09.311]  It's absurd, right?
[02:55:09.771 --> 02:55:12.794]  I mean, how are you a white supremacist and then you're inspired by some black woman?
[02:55:12.814 --> 02:55:14.615]  And he specifically admits he's trolling.
[02:55:14.655 --> 02:55:18.699]  He pasted all these famous trolls about he's a Navy SEAL that somebody else wrote.
[02:55:19.199 --> 02:55:22.802]  He says, well, I'm for violence, but not as much as Candace, when she's anti-violent.
[02:55:22.822 --> 02:55:24.424]  I mean, he's purposely lying.
[02:55:25.489 --> 02:55:26.612]  I mean, he's kind of a troll.
[02:55:26.672 --> 02:55:32.569]  He was just trying to—it was a form of memetic warfare, but it was like, you know, really crazy shit.
[02:55:33.166 --> 02:55:35.968]  But the thing is, they see how effective it is, right?
[02:55:36.008 --> 02:55:39.771]  You send in this leftist, you create this narrative that he's a Trump supporter.
[02:55:40.231 --> 02:55:49.658]  I honestly think it's highly suspicious that this guy claims to, you know, have disliked Islamic immigration but then he spent time in Pakistan and Turkey.
[02:55:49.678 --> 02:55:56.082]  By the way, former CIA section chiefs have come out and said they think it's an Islamic false flag.
[02:55:56.383 --> 02:55:58.204]  Whether that's true or not, they have a right to say it.
[02:55:59.730 --> 02:56:05.295]  Yeah, well, I mean, look, I think people are really just kind of going overboard with this.
[02:56:05.415 --> 02:56:11.040]  I got in a little bit of hot water, but I'm used to making comments like this, so I'm just going to go out and say it.
[02:56:11.100 --> 02:56:12.041]  I mean, I don't really care.
[02:56:12.061 --> 02:56:14.723]  I don't really care about Christchurch, right?
[02:56:15.564 --> 02:56:23.967]  Why is it that we're expected to care about Christ Church so much, when every single day all around the world, you know, Muslims are slaughtering Christians and Jews?
[02:56:24.047 --> 02:56:26.428]  There's a Christian genocide taking place right now.
[02:56:26.968 --> 02:56:30.909]  And every single year, an estimated 90,000 Christians are murdered by Muslims.
[02:56:31.489 --> 02:56:33.030]  And in Israel, right?
[02:56:34.491 --> 02:56:42.078]  Oh yeah, when there's a suicide bombing that kills 20 people, or a mosque blows up another Muslim group, nobody cares.
[02:56:42.118 --> 02:56:45.461]  No, it's true, and that's what that senator in Australia said.
[02:56:45.481 --> 02:56:54.930]  Listen, there are thousands of churches blown up, hundreds of synagogues bombed, constant attacks on Christians and Jews, no coverage, and so a kid smashes an egg on his head for saying that.
[02:56:56.383 --> 02:56:57.624]  Yeah, and I want to know, too.
[02:56:57.664 --> 02:57:01.847]  Like, do I get to go crack an egg on Ilhan Omar's hijab now?
[02:57:01.927 --> 02:57:07.751]  Because this guy, I mean, the left is celebrating cracking an egg on someone's head who they view as hateful.
[02:57:08.151 --> 02:57:11.233]  Well, look, I'm a Zionist, and I think that Ilhan Omar is
[02:57:11.753 --> 02:57:16.977]  Very hateful in her rhetoric towards Israel and the Jewish people and even Christians and Americans.
[02:57:17.137 --> 02:57:21.940]  And so I want to know, like, what's going to happen if I go to Congress and I crack an egg on her hijab?
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.222]  And by the way, they make Zionists a dirty word.
[02:57:24.282 --> 02:57:28.705]  What's wrong with Jews believing Israel has a right to a homeland when the Muslims want the whole world?
[02:57:28.725 --> 02:57:29.766]  I mean, I'm a Jewish nationalist.
[02:57:29.786 --> 02:57:30.646]  That's what Zionism is.
[02:57:31.147 --> 02:57:31.587]  We'll stay there.
[02:57:31.607 --> 02:57:32.327]  We'll come back to talk about that.
[02:57:32.347 --> 02:57:33.508]  Then I've got Millie Weaver coming on.
[02:57:33.528 --> 02:57:34.069]  Do five more minutes.
[02:57:34.489 --> 02:57:37.151]  My point is the Muslims say they're going to get the whole world.
[02:57:38.357 --> 02:57:46.146]  I mean, they're saying everything is theirs, and I'm supposed to just roll over and say, well, come cut my daughter's genitals off and throw gay people off buildings.
[02:57:46.226 --> 02:57:47.948]  I mean, I'm not gonna put up with it.
[02:57:47.968 --> 02:57:48.649]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:48.669 --> 02:57:49.110]  Stay with us.
[02:57:52.794 --> 02:57:54.876]  If you don't read the newspaper, you're uninformed.
[02:57:55.257 --> 02:57:56.799]  If you do read it, you're misinformed.
[02:58:00.612 --> 02:58:01.573]  That's a great question.
[02:58:01.833 --> 02:58:04.036]  What is the long-term effect of too much information?
[02:58:04.857 --> 02:58:08.301]  One of the effects is the need to be first, not even to be true anymore.
[02:58:08.341 --> 02:58:18.552]  We are hearing from a Native American elder, a Vietnam War veteran, speaking to CNN after a disturbing viral video shows a group of teens harassing and mocking him in the nation's capital.
[02:58:18.772 --> 02:58:20.653]  The videos have drawn outrage.
[02:58:20.733 --> 02:58:21.133]  Outrage.
[02:58:21.233 --> 02:58:21.593]  Outrage.
[02:58:21.693 --> 02:58:22.093]  Outrage.
[02:58:22.193 --> 02:58:23.633]  Outrage from all corners.
[02:58:23.673 --> 02:58:25.974]  Here's the video sparking outrage on social media.
[02:58:25.994 --> 02:58:27.894]  Sparked outrage on social media.
[02:58:27.914 --> 02:58:35.676]  A group of teenagers, many wearing Make America Great Again hats, were caught on video taunting a Native American Vietnam veteran.
[02:58:35.876 --> 02:58:37.857]  So what a responsibility you all have.
[02:58:39.127 --> 02:58:40.448]  To be, to tell the truth.
[02:58:41.049 --> 02:58:42.050]  Not just to be first.
[02:58:42.510 --> 02:58:43.311]  But to tell the truth.
[02:58:43.571 --> 02:58:47.415]  A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people.
[02:58:47.555 --> 02:58:48.155]  And they are.
[02:58:48.516 --> 02:58:49.977]  They are the enemy of the people.
[02:58:50.998 --> 02:58:52.780]  Because they have no sources.
[02:58:53.821 --> 02:58:54.982]  They just make them up.
[02:58:55.939 --> 02:58:56.619]  When there are none.
[02:58:56.840 --> 02:58:58.721]  We live in a society now where it's just first.
[02:58:58.761 --> 02:58:59.281]  Who cares?
[02:58:59.521 --> 02:59:00.121]  Get it out there.
[02:59:00.141 --> 02:59:01.422]  We don't care who it hurts.
[02:59:01.462 --> 02:59:02.563]  We don't care who we destroy.
[02:59:02.703 --> 02:59:03.683]  We don't care if it's true.
[02:59:03.983 --> 02:59:04.544]  Just say it.
[02:59:04.624 --> 02:59:05.024]  Sell it.
[02:59:05.284 --> 02:59:08.346]  The President of the United States is racist.
[02:59:08.486 --> 02:59:11.928]  The President of the United States is a weak man.
[02:59:12.028 --> 02:59:12.768]  He's a racist.
[02:59:13.089 --> 02:59:13.749]  He's a punk.
[02:59:14.289 --> 02:59:14.990]  He's a dog.
[02:59:15.290 --> 02:59:15.970]  He's a pig.
[02:59:16.030 --> 02:59:17.351]  He's a bully and he's a bitch.
[02:59:17.491 --> 02:59:18.752]  He's unfit to be human.
[02:59:19.252 --> 02:59:20.893]  Anything you practice, you'll get good at.
[02:59:22.494 --> 02:59:22.954]  Including BS.
[02:59:27.992 --> 02:59:29.092]  We've got some breaking news.
[02:59:29.312 --> 02:59:36.134]  Actor and musician Jussie Smollett from the hit show Empire was attacked and beaten early this morning in Chicago.
[02:59:36.174 --> 02:59:37.695]  Racism is alive and well.
[02:59:37.755 --> 02:59:40.976]  And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.
[02:59:41.156 --> 02:59:43.116]  The fact that we have these fear mongrels.
[02:59:43.356 --> 02:59:48.558]  These people that are trying to separate us and it's just not okay.
[02:59:51.519 --> 02:59:52.339]  Did I make that up too?
[02:59:54.491 --> 03:00:00.453]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:04.474 --> 03:00:06.014]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:06.074 --> 03:00:10.155]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:32.898 --> 03:00:35.560]  Well, she was just on Roseanne Barr's big podcast.
[03:00:36.181 --> 03:00:38.183]  She's got Trump putting out her hashtag.
[03:00:38.743 --> 03:00:40.004]  Hashtag stop the bias.
[03:00:40.125 --> 03:00:40.865]  I mean, it's on.
[03:00:41.626 --> 03:00:42.507]  The fight is on.
[03:00:43.027 --> 03:00:45.670]  Millie Weaver's coming up as we enter the fourth hour here today.
[03:00:46.130 --> 03:00:49.313]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, but crank up that Led Zeppelin for just a minute.
[03:00:50.754 --> 03:00:52.436]  You know, Robert Plant lived in Austin a while.
[03:00:53.484 --> 03:00:56.106]  And I had a chance to ask him a question once.
[03:00:57.107 --> 03:00:59.649]  I'd already heard him say, no, that song's not satanic.
[03:01:00.189 --> 03:01:01.830]  Jimmy Page was into magic and stuff.
[03:01:02.150 --> 03:01:04.432]  That song's about the devil trying to rip you off.
[03:01:04.872 --> 03:01:06.033]  Now you don't want to be with the devil.
[03:01:06.053 --> 03:01:07.014]  That's why you got so upset.
[03:01:07.334 --> 03:01:08.735]  So I can tell you, this song is not satanic.
[03:01:08.755 --> 03:01:10.456]  You think the devil can make something this beautiful?
[03:01:11.117 --> 03:01:12.938]  This song, to me, is a beautiful thing.
[03:01:12.978 --> 03:01:13.479]  Crank it up.
[03:01:16.681 --> 03:01:18.883]  When our shadows were taller than our souls,
[03:01:21.425 --> 03:01:23.126]  There was a lady we all know.
[03:01:26.186 --> 03:01:27.867]  Shines white light and wants to show.
[03:01:28.047 --> 03:01:35.209]  Doesn't matter.
[03:01:35.269 --> 03:01:37.550]  You got governors saying abort babies after they're born.
[03:01:38.530 --> 03:01:39.471]  Christians aren't worried about that.
[03:01:39.491 --> 03:01:40.571]  They're worried about Led Zeppelin.
[03:01:41.151 --> 03:01:44.032]  Get the beam out of your eye before you get the speck out of mine.
[03:01:44.412 --> 03:01:45.252]  That's all I'm saying.
[03:01:45.532 --> 03:01:46.773]  Nothing to worry about Led Zeppelin.
[03:01:48.098 --> 03:01:49.920]  That's how they turn people off against Christianity.
[03:01:49.940 --> 03:01:51.181]  It's all the Pharisee crap.
[03:01:51.201 --> 03:01:55.905]  It's like, Christ, why are you hanging out with the money collectors and the tax collectors and the whores?
[03:01:56.325 --> 03:01:59.127]  He goes, if they're at least looking for God, you think you already found God.
[03:01:59.167 --> 03:02:00.068]  You think you're God.
[03:02:00.588 --> 03:02:01.489]  So go pray in public.
[03:02:02.330 --> 03:02:03.511]  I've got my relationship with God.
[03:02:03.951 --> 03:02:06.013]  Laura Loomer, in closing, thanks for all your time.
[03:02:06.413 --> 03:02:07.274]  You are really kicking butt.
[03:02:07.294 --> 03:02:10.237]  You're going to be on with us during the 50-hour broadcast that's coming up.
[03:02:10.297 --> 03:02:11.918]  It's Thursday, 8 a.m., kicking off.
[03:02:12.539 --> 03:02:13.860]  You've always got big stuff planned.
[03:02:13.880 --> 03:02:21.167]  I don't want to say it on air, but people should be watching lauraloomer.us this weekend because we're about to see more classic Laura Loomer.
[03:02:22.864 --> 03:02:26.566]  Yeah, I can't wait, and of course I'll always give you the first shot at it.
[03:02:26.647 --> 03:02:30.569]  So thanks for everything, Alex, and I'm looking forward to coming on the broadcast again.
[03:02:30.749 --> 03:02:32.110]  How was Roseanne Barr?
[03:02:32.150 --> 03:02:34.612]  Because at first she apologized, now she gets that was a trap.
[03:02:35.908 --> 03:02:37.129]  Oh, she's wonderful.
[03:02:37.189 --> 03:02:40.130]  We had a really good conversation about all types of issues.
[03:02:40.150 --> 03:02:42.531]  That's going to be going up on her YouTube channel soon.
[03:02:43.431 --> 03:02:50.414]  You know, she's a fun lady, and she really likes you and wants to have you on, and so we were talking about you yesterday as well.
[03:02:50.474 --> 03:02:53.176]  But she's great, and what they did to her is really terrible.
[03:02:53.216 --> 03:02:58.118]  I mean, ABC, they fired Roseanne, and then they just rehired this pedophile named Gunn.
[03:02:58.138 --> 03:03:00.479]  I mean, they really are satanic, these people.
[03:03:02.208 --> 03:03:07.876]  I know you gotta go, but the two minutes we have left, what else can you, what do you expect at a gut level in this fight for free speech?
[03:03:09.838 --> 03:03:16.688]  Well, it's gonna get real nasty and I think that Donald Trump needs to do some type of executive order because
[03:03:17.412 --> 03:03:27.260]  Well, a lot of people are going to learn that, unfortunately, these protections that are outlined in Section 230, right, it's going to cause a lot of dilemmas for people.
[03:03:27.720 --> 03:03:36.387]  And I think that for far too long, these companies have been able to acquire massive amounts of power, making them even more powerful than the federal government, which is wrong.
[03:03:37.007 --> 03:03:44.490]  And I think that it really needs to go to the Supreme Court or, you know, there needs to be some type of executive action taken on this.
[03:03:44.550 --> 03:03:53.094]  And as a conservative, you know, I hate to say that because, you know, we are against, you know, government's intervention, but I really do think that this is an exception.
[03:03:53.114 --> 03:03:53.634]  Well, exactly.
[03:03:53.694 --> 03:03:55.875]  I mean, there are human rights violations.
[03:03:56.135 --> 03:04:00.616]  They're operating as government entities in collusion to censor and suppress people.
[03:04:00.656 --> 03:04:01.917]  They're clear and present dangers.
[03:04:02.277 --> 03:04:03.677]  And I don't like government involved.
[03:04:03.717 --> 03:04:05.477]  Go back to Section 230 as it was.
[03:04:05.858 --> 03:04:07.658]  Leave everybody alone, as long as it's not illegal.
[03:04:08.098 --> 03:04:12.099]  Leave it on there and stop it and quit it or lose your 230.
[03:04:12.139 --> 03:04:13.220]  And they've got to see now.
[03:04:13.780 --> 03:04:14.560]  I never even got to this.
[03:04:14.600 --> 03:04:16.640]  All these state attorney generals are getting ready to go after him.
[03:04:17.041 --> 03:04:18.421]  And all these governments are going after him.
[03:04:18.821 --> 03:04:21.902]  I mean, they've got to understand that by them becoming censors,
[03:04:22.743 --> 03:04:24.734]  They have opened the door to their own destruction.
[03:04:24.795 --> 03:04:26.424]  It's very, very foolish.
[03:04:28.083 --> 03:04:32.106]  Yeah, well, like I said, I'm going to be going after a lot of these executives.
[03:04:32.266 --> 03:04:35.688]  And I have investigators monitoring their behavior, their patterns.
[03:04:36.429 --> 03:04:37.770]  And we're keeping tabs on them.
[03:04:37.790 --> 03:04:39.251]  We're monitoring them very closely.
[03:04:39.291 --> 03:04:47.196]  And so stay tuned, because come this year, I'm going to be releasing a lot of really groundbreaking expos and investigations.
[03:04:47.216 --> 03:04:49.598]  That's right, because they think they control cyberspace.
[03:04:49.738 --> 03:04:51.099]  We control third dimension.
[03:04:51.139 --> 03:04:52.920]  And now they force us back into third dimension.
[03:04:53.240 --> 03:04:54.481]  And now the fight's just begun.
[03:04:54.521 --> 03:04:56.062]  LauraLumer.us.
[03:04:56.102 --> 03:04:56.702]  Thank you, Laura.
[03:04:56.742 --> 03:04:57.183]  God bless.
[03:04:58.171 --> 03:04:58.755]  Yeah, thank you.
[03:04:59.077 --> 03:04:59.601]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:59.621 --> 03:05:00.023]  Stay with us.
[03:05:03.294 --> 03:05:07.976]  And now, the globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[03:05:08.757 --> 03:05:12.599]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[03:05:12.999 --> 03:05:20.022]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[03:05:20.943 --> 03:05:23.164]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[03:05:24.064 --> 03:05:27.546]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[03:05:28.873 --> 03:05:31.834]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[03:05:32.015 --> 03:05:33.535]  We are the power structure.
[03:05:34.055 --> 03:05:35.076]  We are the inventors.
[03:05:35.656 --> 03:05:36.717]  We are the trailblazers.
[03:05:37.437 --> 03:05:40.238]  And the globalists understand that.
[03:05:40.838 --> 03:05:46.781]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[03:05:47.941 --> 03:05:51.763]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[03:05:52.811 --> 03:06:03.316]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off InfoWarsTore.com, something everybody should take advantage of.
[03:06:07.418 --> 03:06:11.420]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:06:13.982 --> 03:06:17.884]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:25.491 --> 03:06:34.080]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:34.700 --> 03:06:40.126]  And we believe that if we offer freedom and classic Americana and renaissance
[03:06:41.536 --> 03:06:44.258]  In Jesus Christ, the people want that.
[03:06:44.778 --> 03:06:45.799]  And they're going to respond to that.
[03:06:45.839 --> 03:06:46.919]  We believe in humanity.
[03:06:47.299 --> 03:06:48.320]  We believe in your strength.
[03:06:48.640 --> 03:06:50.361]  I want to see you stronger than I am.
[03:06:50.962 --> 03:06:52.743]  I want to see you more successful than I am.
[03:06:53.403 --> 03:06:54.624]  Because I have a connection to you.
[03:06:55.164 --> 03:06:56.705]  Your success is my success.
[03:06:58.206 --> 03:07:00.407]  Psychopaths and sociopaths think I'm weak.
[03:07:00.928 --> 03:07:04.089]  Because I feel connected to everybody.
[03:07:04.750 --> 03:07:08.332]  Including animals, plants, the universe, and God.
[03:07:08.892 --> 03:07:09.833]  But that's all there is.
[03:07:10.731 --> 03:07:11.691]  And it's like a cancer.
[03:07:11.731 --> 03:07:13.832]  And I've said this many times because it's so true.
[03:07:15.132 --> 03:07:23.413]  If cancer had a consciousness, as it reprogrammed cells and took over the body for the six months it would take to kill you, it would think it was the elite.
[03:07:24.173 --> 03:07:25.414]  It would think it was dominant.
[03:07:25.454 --> 03:07:26.574]  It would think it was God.
[03:07:27.794 --> 03:07:34.715]  It would think it had all the power because it could reprogram an existing ancient system it couldn't even imagine.
[03:07:35.975 --> 03:07:37.476]  When all it was was a malfunction.
[03:07:38.216 --> 03:07:38.916]  A runaway train.
[03:07:40.737 --> 03:07:41.458]  A building fire.
[03:07:42.538 --> 03:07:43.819]  Cholera in the water supply.
[03:07:48.342 --> 03:07:52.966]  We're going to go to Millie Weaver and the big report she's going to be breaking during the 50 Hour Broadcaster in a moment.
[03:07:55.888 --> 03:08:08.116]  The fact that Zero Hedge, and I'm sure if we check the IP addresses, I'm getting calls and emails everywhere from Australia and New Zealand saying they can't go to InfoWars.com now, but they can go to NewsWars.com.
[03:08:08.136 --> 03:08:09.097]  That's why we created that.
[03:08:14.161 --> 03:08:15.942]  DredgeReport.com is the top link to it right now.
[03:08:16.762 --> 03:08:18.162]  But that's the season we're in.
[03:08:20.883 --> 03:08:21.664]  That's what's going on.
[03:08:22.824 --> 03:08:24.225]  You know, I didn't plug any last hour.
[03:08:24.845 --> 03:08:26.345]  And I've said I'm our own biggest enemy.
[03:08:26.585 --> 03:08:28.286]  But the listeners tend to get it.
[03:08:29.666 --> 03:08:30.987]  They respond when I plug.
[03:08:31.787 --> 03:08:37.449]  But I get so obsessed with news, the most profitable time to plug is at the very start of a show.
[03:08:37.609 --> 03:08:38.189]  Anybody will tell you that.
[03:08:38.209 --> 03:08:42.411]  It's always like, coming up, The Andy Griffin Show, with Andy Griffin, brought to you by Jell-O.
[03:08:43.496 --> 03:08:44.477]  Our Michelin tires.
[03:08:45.297 --> 03:08:49.540]  I bought this DVD set years ago because I only would let my kids watch old television.
[03:08:50.720 --> 03:08:54.202]  Like, the most racy is like Dallas or something.
[03:08:56.303 --> 03:09:00.286]  Stuff like I Dream of Jeannie, Green Acres, Gilligan's Island is their favorite.
[03:09:03.968 --> 03:09:07.490]  Andy Griffith is one of their favorites.
[03:09:08.956 --> 03:09:10.738]  And then later, they like Hawaii Five-0s.
[03:09:10.778 --> 03:09:11.399]  That's on cable.
[03:09:11.419 --> 03:09:13.761]  We watched the old Hawaii Five-0s with McGarrett.
[03:09:14.682 --> 03:09:17.825]  And once they watch wholesome shows like that, they don't even want to watch the new stuff.
[03:09:18.366 --> 03:09:20.348]  Because the acting's better, it's all more real.
[03:09:20.548 --> 03:09:24.753]  It's like, wow, you watch those old shows, the comedy's funny, it's all just ridiculously good.
[03:09:24.813 --> 03:09:30.379]  But... I don't know why I've gone down that road.
[03:09:30.879 --> 03:09:31.720]  I was just thinking about...
[03:09:34.082 --> 03:09:42.911]  How they plug up front on those old shows, because I bought a DVD set years ago off Amazon, and it was the Andy Griffith like first season.
[03:09:43.512 --> 03:09:45.654]  I didn't know it was like the first season off TV.
[03:09:45.694 --> 03:09:50.359]  It was even kind of low res, but it was like Andy Griffith going, this hour is brought to you by Jell-O.
[03:09:50.820 --> 03:09:55.585]  Here in Mayberry, we like Jell-O cherry flavor, grape flavor, mint flavor.
[03:09:55.625 --> 03:09:56.506]  We put a little bit of this
[03:09:58.407 --> 03:09:59.168]  Cool Whip on it.
[03:09:59.849 --> 03:10:00.589]  It's so good.
[03:10:01.310 --> 03:10:03.733]  I'm like telling my wife, hey, go to the store and get some Cool Whip.
[03:10:04.293 --> 03:10:06.396]  Get some cherry, cherry, whatever.
[03:10:06.696 --> 03:10:13.543]  The point is, is that the most profitable time for us to plug... This hour is not brought to you by Jell-O, by the way.
[03:10:13.563 --> 03:10:14.284]  I'm telling it for a story.
[03:10:18.834 --> 03:10:23.896]  The most profitable time to plug a product is the first 10 minutes of a show, or right up front, this hour brought to you by.
[03:10:24.236 --> 03:10:24.837]  I never do it.
[03:10:24.937 --> 03:10:25.677]  I just can't do it.
[03:10:25.997 --> 03:10:32.820]  I do it at the end, because I just get so obsessed with the news, and then I can't hire the dozen or so reporters I'm ready to hire.
[03:10:33.740 --> 03:10:41.303]  I can't do all these big things we've got ready on the drawing board because I won't do my job and raise the money.
[03:10:42.064 --> 03:10:43.124]  I won't cut the ads.
[03:10:43.284 --> 03:10:44.465]  I won't promote the products.
[03:10:44.705 --> 03:10:45.745]  I'm the problem around here.
[03:10:46.145 --> 03:10:47.046]  Show, I'm going to do it right now.
[03:10:48.342 --> 03:10:49.523]  Don't let me be the problem.
[03:10:49.863 --> 03:10:54.266]  We've got supplements and books and videos and t-shirts and great things you need.
[03:10:54.646 --> 03:10:56.367]  Whatever the best shortwave radio is, we get it.
[03:10:56.728 --> 03:10:58.269]  Whatever the best optics are, we get it.
[03:10:58.749 --> 03:11:00.350]  Whatever the best supplements are, we get it.
[03:11:00.390 --> 03:11:01.811]  Whatever the best t-shirt is, we get it.
[03:11:02.231 --> 03:11:03.052]  And we discount it.
[03:11:03.852 --> 03:11:07.815]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot Points, 10% off when you sign up for AutoShip.
[03:11:11.299 --> 03:11:13.300]  50% off all the supplements, but there's a bunch of other deals as well.
[03:11:13.681 --> 03:11:15.702]  Now, I had to pull the protein bars because those are selling out.
[03:11:16.182 --> 03:11:19.384]  And TurboForce, I'm not mad at the crew, but that's supposed to be off today, too.
[03:11:19.444 --> 03:11:21.906]  That's about to sell out, but that'll be gone by tomorrow.
[03:11:22.486 --> 03:11:26.088]  But we've got BrainForce, we've got X2 back, we've got Colonial Silver, Silver Bullet.
[03:11:26.709 --> 03:11:29.010]  We've got Happies, natural herbs make you calm and happy.
[03:11:29.290 --> 03:11:30.931]  We've got the fish rolls about to sell out.
[03:11:31.172 --> 03:11:32.732]  We've got X2, we didn't think we could get any more.
[03:11:32.772 --> 03:11:33.793]  That's coming back in.
[03:11:34.093 --> 03:11:35.174]  That's actually back in stock.
[03:11:35.554 --> 03:11:37.355]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:11:40.438 --> 03:11:42.927]  And the PO Box is on there as well, but thank you all!
[03:11:44.363 --> 03:11:47.604]  Thank you for your support.
[03:11:47.664 --> 03:11:49.024]  InfoWarsTore.com or AAA253-3139.
[03:11:49.084 --> 03:11:52.825]  And there's just so much freedom still left in the world.
[03:11:52.945 --> 03:11:56.365]  Soros and Hillary and Podesta, they're not in full control.
[03:11:56.525 --> 03:11:58.406]  And Juncker, he's not in full control.
[03:11:58.686 --> 03:12:00.206]  There's still some America left.
[03:12:00.226 --> 03:12:01.946]  There's still people out there.
[03:12:01.966 --> 03:12:03.626]  And you just keep seeing the guests we have.
[03:12:03.666 --> 03:12:08.307]  And what we do is always in the center of the fight and always affecting change and always there.
[03:12:08.367 --> 03:12:09.368]  Because we're in the zeitgeist.
[03:12:09.588 --> 03:12:10.448]  We want to be there.
[03:12:10.648 --> 03:12:11.428]  You're there with us.
[03:12:12.307 --> 03:12:16.190]  And when you pray for us, or just give us goodwill, just think about us and love us.
[03:12:16.410 --> 03:12:17.511]  We're thinking about you and loving you.
[03:12:17.811 --> 03:12:23.255]  And when you buy the products, or you spread the word, or you tell folks about the show, word of mouth, it changes the world.
[03:12:23.515 --> 03:12:24.295]  So keep doing it.
[03:12:24.576 --> 03:12:26.337]  From myself and the great crew, we salute you.
[03:12:26.697 --> 03:12:27.458]  Now, Millie Weaver!
[03:12:28.410 --> 03:12:30.451]  She was back on the job a week after she had her latest baby.
[03:12:30.531 --> 03:12:31.371]  Two babies.
[03:12:31.711 --> 03:12:32.592]  Very jealous over there.
[03:12:32.612 --> 03:12:34.152]  I've only got four myself, but I do want more.
[03:12:34.512 --> 03:12:39.174]  I'm not envious of anything, but I am envious of beautiful families and children, and how I want even more.
[03:12:39.194 --> 03:12:40.715]  I could have 50 children if I could get away with it.
[03:12:41.275 --> 03:12:42.355]  But Millie, you're awesome.
[03:12:43.436 --> 03:12:46.577]  Tell us about this big report you've got coming up, but also, first, we'll do that next segment.
[03:12:46.997 --> 03:12:53.279]  What do you make about Zero Hedge and others having their URLs banned in Australia and New Zealand?
[03:12:53.599 --> 03:12:54.720]  That's top story on drugs.
[03:12:54.740 --> 03:12:55.420]  That's pretty scary.
[03:12:56.704 --> 03:12:58.465]  Well, this is all what they're going toward.
[03:12:58.626 --> 03:12:59.866]  Internet censorship.
[03:13:00.307 --> 03:13:10.735]  You can talk to most leftists today and ask them whether or not they think that the internet needs policing and they'll tell you yes because of things like the New Zealand shooting.
[03:13:11.015 --> 03:13:17.320]  So that tells you that obviously the mainstream media leftist news outlets that they're watching
[03:13:17.760 --> 03:13:20.781]  Well he said I'm a troll, but we're not supposed to even say that.
[03:13:43.621 --> 03:13:43.961]  Right?
[03:13:44.061 --> 03:13:48.523]  I mean, that's the whole thing with trolls is you can't really figure out, are they this or are they that?
[03:13:48.583 --> 03:13:50.624]  And that's part of the game of trolling.
[03:13:51.044 --> 03:13:56.927]  It's part of the sophistication where no one can really fully put their finger on what's going on.
[03:13:57.047 --> 03:13:59.468]  And that is part of the whole point of trolling.
[03:13:59.508 --> 03:14:04.130]  So I would say in essence, because we can't really tell what he is, he's most likely a troll.
[03:14:06.872 --> 03:14:07.512]  Why are they?
[03:14:08.928 --> 03:14:10.189]  We see Kennedy getting killed.
[03:14:10.229 --> 03:14:11.370]  We see Nazis killing people.
[03:14:11.390 --> 03:14:12.992]  You know, it's sad stuff, but we need to see it.
[03:14:13.632 --> 03:14:16.495]  Since when is it ten years in prison if you even have this video?
[03:14:16.595 --> 03:14:19.598]  Why are they so scared to even let anybody have the video?
[03:14:20.851 --> 03:14:32.375]  Well Alex, don't you remember when we were talking months ago and I showed you that Facebook had already acquired the government ID verification systems and softwares.
[03:14:32.415 --> 03:14:44.739]  They bought the software companies that allow for scanning IDs so that people then have to have government ID in order to even keep or create their Facebook account.
[03:14:44.759 --> 03:14:45.019]  So that's it.
[03:14:45.299 --> 03:14:50.978]  They're going to use this crisis as the rollout of the global internet ID to tax, to control the internet.
[03:14:51.019 --> 03:14:51.821]  That's what this is about.
[03:14:52.509 --> 03:14:59.973]  They want to shut the whole thing down and start it back up to where everyone has to have a fingerprint on the internet.
[03:15:00.293 --> 03:15:15.701]  And that's why we're seeing instances where, okay, troll farms, which are mostly happening on 4chan, PollHN, and Discord apps, and other various encrypted message boards, we're going to see an abuse happening there.
[03:15:17.213 --> 03:15:21.035]  Who is motivating that abuse financially?
[03:15:21.095 --> 03:15:22.916]  Who's paying some of these troll farms?
[03:15:23.136 --> 03:15:24.336]  That's the real question.
[03:15:24.897 --> 03:15:33.361]  And we're seeing a misuse and abuse intentionally in order to justify internet policing.
[03:15:36.022 --> 03:15:36.622]  That's right, Millie.
[03:15:36.642 --> 03:15:39.443]  I don't know what we call this segment, but that's really what they're announcing.
[03:15:40.524 --> 03:15:41.705]  New Zealand massacre.
[03:15:42.505 --> 03:15:44.486]  Big Tech says New Zealand massacre.
[03:15:46.201 --> 03:15:52.525]  Warrants World Internet ID or Big Tech pushes Internet ID in wake of New Zealand massacre.
[03:15:52.565 --> 03:15:52.865]  That's it.
[03:15:53.285 --> 03:15:56.587]  Big Tech pushes Internet ID in wake of New Zealand massacre.
[03:15:56.607 --> 03:16:00.029]  And with that comes tracking, censorship, taxing, control.
[03:16:03.903 --> 03:16:13.327]  We're going to do, this Thursday through Friday through Saturday, a 50-hour emergency Save the First Amendment broadcast with a bunch of special guests and a bunch of stuff we've never done before.
[03:16:13.467 --> 03:16:14.587]  Believe me, this is going to be special.
[03:16:14.687 --> 03:16:15.528]  Thursday 8 a.m.
[03:16:15.548 --> 03:16:19.149]  with David Knight, right through Saturday 10 a.m., 50 hours, a bunch of special guests.
[03:16:19.269 --> 03:16:25.011]  We're going to blur out the violence, but we're going to look at all the anomalies, not even saying there's anomalies.
[03:16:25.171 --> 03:16:26.412]  We have a right to.
[03:16:26.612 --> 03:16:31.314]  The truth is, governments do do stuff like this, and it's legitimate for anybody to ask those type of questions.
[03:16:33.032 --> 03:16:36.034]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[03:16:36.414 --> 03:16:42.317]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[03:16:42.737 --> 03:16:48.600]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[03:16:48.920 --> 03:16:51.561]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[03:16:51.841 --> 03:16:59.349]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[03:16:59.369 --> 03:17:07.578]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[03:17:08.179 --> 03:17:12.444]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[03:17:13.303 --> 03:17:16.905]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[03:17:17.105 --> 03:17:23.069]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[03:17:24.049 --> 03:17:32.894]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[03:17:33.434 --> 03:17:37.637]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[03:17:37.657 --> 03:17:39.418]  You're probably going, wait a minute.
[03:17:40.509 --> 03:17:42.295]  So the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[03:17:42.315 --> 03:17:43.620]  It was the last run.
[03:17:43.640 --> 03:17:44.583]  It's been sold out for two months.
[03:17:45.680 --> 03:17:46.561]  How is X2 back?
[03:17:47.021 --> 03:17:50.644]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[03:17:51.104 --> 03:17:53.346]  We got put over the barrels and industrial sabotage.
[03:17:53.366 --> 03:17:54.187]  We couldn't get any more.
[03:17:54.767 --> 03:18:04.815]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[03:18:04.875 --> 03:18:08.839]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[03:18:09.239 --> 03:18:10.360]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[03:18:10.780 --> 03:18:15.145]  You need to do research into iodine and the iodine conspiracy for yourself.
[03:18:15.585 --> 03:18:17.387]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[03:18:17.808 --> 03:18:19.109]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[03:18:19.629 --> 03:18:21.912]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[03:18:22.392 --> 03:18:24.715]  I want like a 4.9 star on power reviews.
[03:18:25.335 --> 03:18:28.839]  But many of you hear me talk about this and it's just more background chatter.
[03:18:29.660 --> 03:18:32.123]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[03:18:33.149 --> 03:18:35.471]  Is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[03:18:35.931 --> 03:18:48.299]  So from our brain waves to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[03:18:48.800 --> 03:18:51.301]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[03:18:51.882 --> 03:18:53.002]  So iodine is amazing.
[03:18:53.062 --> 03:18:53.623]  It's important.
[03:18:53.643 --> 03:18:55.884]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[03:18:55.944 --> 03:18:56.485]  They'll hurt you.
[03:18:56.845 --> 03:18:57.545]  This is pure.
[03:18:57.826 --> 03:18:58.526]  This is clean.
[03:18:58.866 --> 03:18:59.647]  This is amazing.
[03:18:59.967 --> 03:19:01.768]  And it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[03:19:03.309 --> 03:19:06.951]  X2, our overall best-selling product, is now back.
[03:19:07.211 --> 03:19:11.993]  X2 original from the very first original manufacturer.
[03:19:12.393 --> 03:19:18.756]  The exact same X2 at InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.

[03:19:35.344 --> 03:19:37.946]  Turmeric is one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[03:19:38.326 --> 03:19:43.670]  It is there for the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support.
[03:19:43.870 --> 03:19:52.016]  And it's got the turmeric root extract, the boswellia serrata extract, organic spearmint, sage, lemon balm, thyme leaves, and piperine from black pepper.

[03:20:36.209 --> 03:20:38.930]  I'm Alex Jones, and I'm a hunted man.
[03:20:39.690 --> 03:20:42.951]  And I love it.
[03:20:43.011 --> 03:20:44.271]  Where else am I supposed to be?
[03:20:45.511 --> 03:20:53.333]  But right in the face of the globalists.
[03:20:54.314 --> 03:20:56.174]  They got to catch me if they want me to.
[03:20:58.415 --> 03:20:59.035]  Catch me.
[03:21:03.857 --> 03:21:05.358]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back.
[03:21:05.598 --> 03:21:08.500]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[03:21:08.540 --> 03:21:15.445]  Millie Weaver, our intrepid reporter, on the eve of breaking huge news about these internet troll farms, joins us.
[03:21:15.925 --> 03:21:26.892]  And she brings up the incredible mergers and acquisitions of Facebook, of internet currency companies, of credit card companies, of other companies, for a global internet ID.
[03:21:26.912 --> 03:21:30.294]  And they've said they want you to do their banking with them, everything.
[03:21:30.334 --> 03:21:31.355]  But if you're not a good globalist,
[03:21:32.588 --> 03:21:33.788]  Then your banking's turned off.
[03:21:35.149 --> 03:21:37.429]  So that's really where all this is moving.
[03:21:37.449 --> 03:21:39.010]  And I've been told that by White House sources.
[03:21:39.050 --> 03:21:41.510]  They said, you're worried about censorship.
[03:21:42.811 --> 03:21:44.371]  Wait till they let you buy and sell.
[03:21:44.771 --> 03:21:46.792]  So it's right out of Revelations and it's here.
[03:21:47.732 --> 03:21:52.754]  Facebook launches, Facebook set to launch Mark of the Beast system.
[03:21:53.094 --> 03:21:54.234]  Millie Weaver, tell us about it.
[03:21:55.831 --> 03:22:10.844]  Yeah, Facebook acquired this actually last year, the government ID verification systems, and it's not really that big of a shock because we've already seen various social media companies require ID for verification status.
[03:22:11.244 --> 03:22:16.990]  So on Twitter, if you wanted to be verified, you had to submit your ID anyway to prove who you are.
[03:22:17.410 --> 03:22:28.441]  So this was something they wanted to kind of test the waters in, and we will just be at a point where essentially everyone then has to use IDs to get on social media networks.
[03:22:28.681 --> 03:22:45.776]  But what we're talking about really is a broader possibility of internet policing, where we could see an intentional shutdown following some kind of a terrorist event or terrorist attack, which then our government would say, okay, let's legislate and let's reopen the internet.
[03:22:45.816 --> 03:22:49.179]  Yeah, that's what they're prepping for is when there's a big event, we've got to cover it.
[03:22:49.219 --> 03:22:50.120]  No one can see it.
[03:22:50.480 --> 03:22:53.523]  So we've got to shut the web down until this new thing is in place.
[03:22:54.483 --> 03:22:58.085]  Exactly, because they can't handle the freeness on the web right now.
[03:22:58.105 --> 03:23:15.697]  They can't handle that it's the Wild West and that, yeah, sometimes you're going to see good things, sometimes you're going to see bad things, but the bottom line is we have to be able to have free speech and people have to be able to have open dialogue and the globalists, the elite, they don't want that to happen because look what happened.
[03:23:15.917 --> 03:23:17.038]  We got Trump elected
[03:23:17.438 --> 03:23:20.780]  During the 2016 presidential campaigns, Hillary was their choice.
[03:23:20.860 --> 03:23:27.743]  She was supposed to get in and tow the establishment's line and policies and agendas, and we totally disrupted that.
[03:23:28.003 --> 03:23:29.384]  They can't have that happening.
[03:23:29.424 --> 03:23:44.811]  So rather than try to meet and battle people on ideas and policies and just arguments and debates, they know that they're pushing lies and deception and that the truth will always rise to the top.
[03:23:45.191 --> 03:23:45.632]  We're good to go.
[03:24:06.514 --> 03:24:11.936]  Another big truth is going to be revealed when we release this documentary that I just made.
[03:24:13.516 --> 03:24:16.237]  It's called Deep Inside a Leftist Troll Farm.
[03:24:16.797 --> 03:24:23.619]  And it really just poses the question, what about all this extremism that we're seeing online?
[03:24:23.659 --> 03:24:24.499]  We're hearing about it.
[03:24:24.519 --> 03:24:26.460]  The leftist media is talking about it all day.
[03:24:27.100 --> 03:24:27.840]  Is it artificial?
[03:24:28.789 --> 03:24:41.733]  That's what we're really looking at and investigating in this short documentary, this exclusive report, where we go into a leftist troll farm with an infiltrator, essentially, that is given passwords.
[03:24:41.873 --> 03:24:53.236]  Now, these, you know, these discords, these private encrypted apps and chat rooms, these were password protected rooms that you had to have access to with passwords.
[03:24:53.356 --> 03:24:56.717]  And this infiltrator got in and was able to watch
[03:24:57.257 --> 03:25:22.994]  Trolling happening and really we kind of we can't really say exactly who is doing the trolling because the whole point of This trolling network is that they all know how to use VPNs and mask their identity So they're they're essentially anonymous but we can get an idea of who they might be by looking at the memes and the content that they're generating and when we're looking at it and
[03:25:23.786 --> 03:25:32.151]  We initially went down this rabbit hole to investigate this meme activity surrounding the whole Yang gang phenomenon.
[03:25:32.491 --> 03:25:41.076]  I mean, recently we've seen all these Yang memes come about, and a lot of them are sowing discord amongst Trump's base.
[03:25:41.176 --> 03:25:50.842]  We saw some people, prominent Trump supporters actually, starting to come out and say things against Trump, and at the same time, pro-Yang.
[03:25:50.862 --> 03:25:59.508]  As you said, it's meant to create a revolution, a crisis to bring down the country, not to repair the country, which is the Helter Skelter Charlie Manson.
[03:25:59.968 --> 03:26:07.513]  It's the admitted plan in his own manifesto of the shooting that did happen in Christchurch.
[03:26:08.453 --> 03:26:09.954]  In fact, I thought it would be ready tomorrow.
[03:26:09.974 --> 03:26:11.135]  You say it's ready now.
[03:26:11.695 --> 03:26:14.257]  Millie, you come in and introduce it and premiere it here.
[03:26:14.818 --> 03:26:16.238]  Always a lot of surprises here, folks.
[03:26:17.059 --> 03:26:18.380]  On the other side, how's that sound, Millie?
[03:26:19.175 --> 03:26:20.196]  That sounds great, Alex.
[03:26:20.257 --> 03:26:22.059]  Yes, we just now released it.
[03:26:22.960 --> 03:26:25.684]  It is up right now on my channel, Millennial Millie.
[03:26:25.724 --> 03:26:29.670]  But like you said, Alex, it sounds like we're going to be premiering it here right now on air.
[03:26:30.311 --> 03:26:34.717]  And it's just really amazing because we actually see, we can watch
[03:26:35.433 --> 03:26:35.613]  The
[03:26:52.958 --> 03:27:03.086]  Well, listen, this happened to Candace Owens where they had leftist posing as racist harassing her and the leftist posing as saviors to get her to come to them.
[03:27:03.106 --> 03:27:04.427]  This is what the universities do.
[03:27:04.928 --> 03:27:05.808]  This is their plan.
[03:27:05.868 --> 03:27:07.029]  We know this goes on.
[03:27:07.049 --> 03:27:09.912]  And then every time we try to cover it, they try to shut us down.
[03:27:09.932 --> 03:27:14.896]  And then back when we used to do our own comments, we would see somebody saying, I'm going to kill all the black people.
[03:27:14.916 --> 03:27:16.017]  I'm going to kill all the white people.
[03:27:16.337 --> 03:27:17.618]  And we'd check the IP address.
[03:27:17.678 --> 03:27:18.659]  It was the same group.
[03:27:19.199 --> 03:27:21.141]  So we know, obviously, there's not
[03:27:22.284 --> 03:27:25.966]  Huge amounts of comments saying N-Word and Cracker and all this other stuff.
[03:27:26.326 --> 03:27:28.047]  This is being done to make us fight with each other.
[03:27:28.367 --> 03:27:39.252]  It's very, very... The directive is to color our websites, our platforms, as hateful, far-right extremists.
[03:27:39.272 --> 03:27:42.394]  And then Oliver Darcy uses that as an excuse to have us taken down.
[03:27:42.434 --> 03:27:46.236]  You're about to take over, Millie, with your two-minute intro to the exclusive Straight Ahead.
[03:27:46.256 --> 03:27:47.936]  It's been posted at InfoWars.com.
[03:27:47.956 --> 03:27:48.437]  Great job.
[03:27:48.877 --> 03:27:50.538]  Viewers, please don't forget.
[03:27:51.198 --> 03:27:52.820]  Without you supporting us, we're not here.
[03:27:53.361 --> 03:27:58.507]  So you're about to see this exclusive over, you know, three weeks of work infiltrating undercover people.
[03:27:59.087 --> 03:27:59.708]  All the stuff.
[03:27:59.728 --> 03:28:00.989]  You're about to see it right now.
[03:28:01.510 --> 03:28:02.411]  A lot went into this.
[03:28:02.451 --> 03:28:03.693]  This is not just your average show.
[03:28:04.053 --> 03:28:04.914]  This isn't MTV.
[03:28:04.974 --> 03:28:05.615]  It's not CNN.
[03:28:05.775 --> 03:28:06.596]  It's not Netflix.
[03:28:06.976 --> 03:28:09.319]  This is grassroots, toe-toe with the globalists.
[03:28:09.339 --> 03:28:10.500]  So tell everybody about
[03:28:11.656 --> 03:28:13.657]  Infowars.com forward slash show right now.
[03:28:14.558 --> 03:28:17.219]  Go get the video from Millie's YouTube while it's still there.
[03:28:17.239 --> 03:28:19.561]  We're going to post it on our server so there's a backup.
[03:28:20.081 --> 03:28:25.805]  Get this out to people because this is the type of hardcore reportage that globalists are so incredibly scared of.
[03:28:26.305 --> 03:28:29.287]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:28:29.387 --> 03:28:33.309]  And don't forget, and thank you all for your support, but you're getting great products at the same time.
[03:28:33.329 --> 03:28:34.150]  It's a win-win.
[03:28:34.190 --> 03:28:34.710]  Why wouldn't you?
[03:28:35.250 --> 03:28:36.371]  StoreWife free shipping.
[03:28:36.951 --> 03:28:37.972]  Double Patriot points.
[03:28:38.112 --> 03:28:39.193]  50% off all the supplements.
[03:28:40.319 --> 03:28:50.027]  Alright, we'll be right back with Millie Weaver and the big premiere of Inside a Leftist Race-Pushing Troll Farm.
[03:28:50.727 --> 03:28:51.808]  Talk about a snake farm.
[03:28:52.309 --> 03:28:53.770]  That just sounds nasty, doesn't it?
[03:28:54.190 --> 03:28:54.871]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:54.891 --> 03:28:55.351]  Stay with us.
[03:29:03.809 --> 03:29:13.253]  We're going to do, this Thursday through Friday through Saturday, a 50-hour emergency Save the First Amendment broadcast with a bunch of special guests and a bunch of stuff we've never done before.
[03:29:13.373 --> 03:29:14.513]  Believe me, this is going to be special.
[03:29:14.613 --> 03:29:15.474]  Thursday 8 a.m.
[03:29:15.494 --> 03:29:19.055]  with David Knight, right through Saturday 10 a.m., 50 hours, a bunch of special guests.
[03:29:19.175 --> 03:29:24.917]  We're going to blur out the violence, but we're going to look at all the anomalies, not even saying there's anomalies.
[03:29:25.077 --> 03:29:26.318]  We have a right to.
[03:29:26.518 --> 03:29:31.220]  The truth is, governments do do stuff like this, and it's legitimate for anybody to ask those type of questions.
[03:29:36.994 --> 03:29:38.797]  Let's go to Megan in Texas.
[03:29:38.837 --> 03:29:39.578]  Megan, you're on the air.
[03:29:39.598 --> 03:29:40.118]  Thanks for holding.
[03:29:40.158 --> 03:29:40.399]  Go ahead.
[03:29:40.599 --> 03:29:40.959]  Hi, Alex.
[03:29:40.979 --> 03:29:41.480]  How are you today?
[03:29:41.640 --> 03:29:42.041]  I'm awesome.
[03:29:42.061 --> 03:29:42.762]  Thank you for calling.
[03:29:42.802 --> 03:29:44.624]  I'm gonna give you a little bit of my background.
[03:29:44.644 --> 03:29:46.226]  I was born and raised in California.
[03:29:46.326 --> 03:29:48.409]  I lived through the downfall of California.
[03:29:48.529 --> 03:29:54.217]  My husband and I got out of there as soon as we graduated from school, came to Texas because to us it was a passion of freedom.
[03:29:54.377 --> 03:29:59.060]  Man, I'm looking at what's happening to Trump right now, and I'm telling you right now, this whole country's going the way of California.
[03:29:59.080 --> 03:30:00.301]  We're going to be disenfranchised.
[03:30:00.381 --> 03:30:02.483]  If they get him out, that's the gateway right there.
[03:30:02.523 --> 03:30:04.624]  There's no more middle of the country anymore.
[03:30:04.644 --> 03:30:05.605]  We're not going to have a say.
[03:30:05.625 --> 03:30:08.166]  I mean, we're killing babies, and we're poisoning the ones we're not killing.
[03:30:08.207 --> 03:30:15.191]  We're just here in Texas trying to raise our three little girls, and I just—what do you think we're going to—if they manage to get him out, what's our contingency plan?
[03:30:15.211 --> 03:30:16.032]  Where do we go from there?
[03:30:16.192 --> 03:30:19.955]  Megan, I hear the earnestness in your voice, the concern, and I absolutely agree with you.
[03:30:20.276 --> 03:30:22.758]  They hit Europe with 15 million military-age men.
[03:30:22.858 --> 03:30:23.518]  It's collapsed.
[03:30:23.638 --> 03:30:24.499]  They broke their borders.
[03:30:24.539 --> 03:30:25.500]  They're breaking ours.
[03:30:25.680 --> 03:30:26.381]  It's treason.
[03:30:26.501 --> 03:30:30.364]  The governor of New Mexico, the governor of California has pulled National Guard off.
[03:30:30.524 --> 03:30:32.766]  We have tens of thousands, four caravans coming.
[03:30:32.966 --> 03:30:36.209]  Five million have announced they're coming in a major gallop pull.
[03:30:36.389 --> 03:30:37.951]  This is insane.
[03:30:38.131 --> 03:30:39.332]  I mean, it is on.
[03:30:39.712 --> 03:30:42.034]  And again, they're using these people as weapons.
[03:30:42.074 --> 03:30:42.995]  They're saying, you know,
[03:30:43.535 --> 03:30:47.796]  No deal on government shutdown unless you get rid of the 100,000 beds and only make it 16,500.
[03:30:48.436 --> 03:30:51.877]  They're literally saying you can't hold rapists and murderers.
[03:30:52.257 --> 03:30:55.578]  They're saying you can't check who the kids are with or what diseases they have.
[03:30:55.958 --> 03:31:01.340]  This is the lawless, world government breaking of America with the Democrat collaborators running it all.
[03:31:01.600 --> 03:31:02.440]  You're absolutely right.
[03:31:02.540 --> 03:31:17.133]  Yeah, um, I just, I feel like, not only that, my husband and I are both business owners, and I hate to say this, but the brain-dead masses, you try to get through to these people, they're so asleep and zombified, and I just want to say, the people who don't live in border states, they have no clue.
[03:31:17.193 --> 03:31:20.817]  They have no clue what's gonna happen when all these people come in and overrun us.
[03:31:20.897 --> 03:31:21.757]  I've seen it happen.
[03:31:21.817 --> 03:31:25.040]  You can go to the downtown area I grew up in, and it's nothing but Spanish.
[03:31:25.100 --> 03:31:27.182]  You go to the Walmart, everything's in Spanish.
[03:31:27.202 --> 03:31:29.004]  If you didn't know Spanish, you didn't get a job.
[03:31:29.124 --> 03:31:32.348]  This is the globalist plan, and it's absolutely two minutes to midnight.
[03:31:32.368 --> 03:31:34.450]  California used to be just like Texas.
[03:31:34.530 --> 03:31:36.252]  It's now a collapsing hellhole.
[03:31:36.272 --> 03:31:37.093]  God bless you, Megan.
[03:31:38.254 --> 03:31:41.518]  Megan was on fire, ladies and gentlemen, and her warning is absolutely true.
[03:31:41.558 --> 03:31:42.299]  Are you gonna listen to her?
[03:31:43.400 --> 03:31:47.225]  Because a lot of Texans, a lot of Oklahomans went out to California.
[03:31:48.653 --> 03:31:52.879]  And now they've come back because the state is gone, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:31:53.100 --> 03:31:55.703]  We have some affiliates out there, still a lot of great people, a beautiful state.
[03:31:56.164 --> 03:32:00.090]  But it's gone, and we have to admit, this is the mindset, this is the program into the future.
[03:32:02.634 --> 03:32:06.496]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[03:32:07.276 --> 03:32:11.098]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[03:32:11.518 --> 03:32:18.562]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[03:32:19.462 --> 03:32:21.683]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[03:32:22.584 --> 03:32:26.066]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[03:32:27.388 --> 03:32:30.351]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[03:32:30.531 --> 03:32:32.072]  We are the power structure.
[03:32:32.572 --> 03:32:33.613]  We are the inventors.
[03:32:34.174 --> 03:32:35.234]  We are the trailblazers.
[03:32:35.955 --> 03:32:38.797]  And the globalists understand that.
[03:32:39.357 --> 03:32:45.302]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[03:32:46.463 --> 03:32:50.286]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[03:32:51.315 --> 03:33:00.265]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off at importstore.com.
[03:33:00.425 --> 03:33:01.847]  Something everybody should take advantage of.
[03:33:06.152 --> 03:33:08.755]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.412 --> 03:33:33.141]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:33.521 --> 03:33:40.348]  I'm Millie Weaver and you're listening to the Alex Jones Show and we are about to release my new report.
[03:33:40.928 --> 03:34:03.393]  It is an exclusive report called Deep Inside a Leftist Troll Farm where we sent undercovers to go in and find out what is behind the mysterious meme activity that we're seeing on the internet and what many people are calling extremist hate speech content that's being perpetuated by bots online.
[03:34:03.774 --> 03:34:09.635]  Now we've seen many governments now calling for internet policing and censorship
[03:34:10.195 --> 03:34:32.470]  Under the justification of these hate groups and hate speech online and we have to ask ourselves how much of this hate speech that we're seeing online is actually real and how much of it is potentially bots and troll farms that are perpetuating this quote-unquote hate speech in order to justify internet sensing and policing.
[03:34:33.030 --> 03:34:52.523]  You know, when you have leftists out there saying that our own president is engaging in hate speech and that he's responsible for the New Zealand shooting, you're also looking at how the leftists are pushing and pointing the finger at these groups online such as InfoWars, Alex Jones, Breitbart.
[03:34:52.543 --> 03:35:01.609]  Many of these conservative sites are now being blamed for these shootings and these terrorist attacks because the left is painting them and coloring them
[03:35:02.169 --> 03:35:03.451]  Curiously, I wanted to see.
[03:35:19.720 --> 03:35:32.652]  So we had an undercover infiltrate a leftist troll farm the last week and what's interesting is this troll farm was getting actual directives on how to sow division and discontent.
[03:35:37.077 --> 03:35:42.243]  is going to collapse and that we should do everything possible to make that as quickly as possible.
[03:35:42.503 --> 03:35:51.652]  Prior to anyone reporting it, we obtained documents which have subsequently been leaked on 4chan that connect to the New Zealand Shooters Manifesto.
[03:35:51.752 --> 03:35:54.956]  You've got an insider watching in live time, then troll you.
[03:35:56.070 --> 03:35:56.410]  Yes!
[03:35:56.450 --> 03:36:00.152]  This New Zealand shooting happened and we're watching the troll farms come into action.
[03:36:11.498 --> 03:36:16.282]  A network of text documents and posts that link to each other.
[03:36:16.582 --> 03:36:23.988]  So you're saying you've got the proof of their pulling this crap, and then Oliver Darcy, that snake, says shut down InfoWars, they've got racist commenters.
[03:36:24.608 --> 03:36:25.109]  That's right.
[03:36:25.229 --> 03:36:33.816]  On Friday again, waking up to accelerationists shooting up a mosque that published a manifesto quite like the game game Need for Profit did.
[03:36:34.496 --> 03:36:38.159]  On 4chan and other social media sites for the act of accelerationism.
[03:36:38.399 --> 03:36:49.370]  The release of documents several days ago on 4chan and 8chan were basically the game plan to influence the public discourse on the message boards.
[03:36:49.750 --> 03:36:52.653]  Literal psyops going on right now on the American public.
[03:36:52.693 --> 03:36:58.518]  To basically drive the United States into the wall, to put the foot on the accelerator.
[03:36:58.759 --> 03:37:03.083]  Which is to accelerate things to its inevitable point as quickly as possible.
[03:37:03.323 --> 03:37:06.044]  To sow more hate.
[03:37:06.084 --> 03:37:21.428]  This could be seen as perhaps a grassroots effort by disaffected groups to spoil the plan of the globalists, or it could be seen as a plan by the globalists to basically induce chaos into a system that they're losing control of.
[03:37:21.728 --> 03:37:29.950]  We must ask ourselves, how much of this supposed hate speech that we see on the internet today is really just artificial?
[03:37:30.330 --> 03:37:49.698]  Rather than lose control of meme culture, of the internet, of public discourse, maybe they want to drive us into open conflict using the concept of accelerationism and therefore scare people, cause civil war, cause the meme war to erupt into a shooting war.
[03:37:49.818 --> 03:37:53.260]  To get the United States to be destroyed or get a thousand dollars in the process.
[03:37:55.322 --> 03:38:06.895]  The investigative report you're about to see is in no way an attempt to contribute to the debunked hoax that there is a Jewish plot to manipulate 4chan into sharing pro-Yang content.
[03:38:07.075 --> 03:38:13.423]  This is merely an attempt to gain insight into a new and dangerous social trend that's occurring online.
[03:38:14.830 --> 03:38:24.940]  Trying to gain understanding behind this apparent hoax, and who may be perpetuating it, we were able to gain access to a private chat room within the Yang Gang's inner circle.
[03:38:25.241 --> 03:38:30.045]  The initial traffic around the Yang Gang meme really drove me to ask questions about it.
[03:38:30.186 --> 03:38:31.447]  Where was it coming from?
[03:38:31.967 --> 03:38:33.289]  How was it being propagated?
[03:38:33.792 --> 03:38:44.561]  An insider leaked to Clover Chronicle that 2020 Democrat hopeful Andrew Yang is paying groups of online meme operators to influence future voters.
[03:38:45.001 --> 03:38:48.984]  So we decided to investigate this alleged Yang Gang troll farm.
[03:38:49.344 --> 03:38:57.291]  Seeking recruitment information, we received directives, resources, and info on how to cover your tracks online.
[03:38:57.611 --> 03:39:00.434]  There has been a massive increase in the posting of Yang.
[03:39:00.855 --> 03:39:02.517]  Yang gang posting.
[03:39:02.997 --> 03:39:07.342]  In other words, the creation of a massive amount of threads related to Andrew Yang.
[03:39:07.603 --> 03:39:15.332]  As you can see, the Yang gang chimes in making comments about the video, nudging the viewer to understand the type of trolling desired.
[03:39:15.492 --> 03:39:34.481]  This is known as the divide and conquer strategy, by essentially splitting Trump's user base and preventing them from talking about Trump in the first place, attacking them where they're weak, by specifically targeting policies that are against the entire idea that Trump is a white nationalist, when in reality Trump just wants what's best for America.
[03:39:34.881 --> 03:39:45.747]  We discovered these trolls were posing as right-wing extremists spreading anti-semitic sentiment while at the same time playing the side of the left.
[03:39:46.167 --> 03:39:51.830]  I discovered a network of text documents and posts that linked to each other.
[03:39:52.270 --> 03:39:54.191]  Within these text documents were
[03:39:54.791 --> 03:39:56.232]  We're good to go.
[03:40:12.856 --> 03:40:21.278]  We were able to watch this troll farm in action as they dogpiled one of my YouTube videos comment sections with comments that matched their directives verbatim.
[03:40:45.638 --> 03:40:52.263]  Our undercover also gained access to detailed instructions about meme generation and content to troll.
[03:40:52.764 --> 03:40:57.767]  Here you can see links to selected content for this troll farm to target.
[03:40:58.308 --> 03:41:02.631]  Jack Posobiec, The Red Elephants, Millennial Millie, even my content.
[03:41:03.191 --> 03:41:05.553]  Daily Caller articles and much more.
[03:41:06.253 --> 03:41:17.121]  We discovered these trolls were posing as right-wing extremists spreading anti-Semitic sentiment while at the same time playing the side of the left.
[03:41:17.641 --> 03:41:25.107]  Essentially acting as sock puppet A and sock puppet B aimed at controlling both sides of political discourse.
[03:41:25.467 --> 03:41:38.333]  What at first appeared to be mere trolling, promoting a particular political platform, turned out to be a more serious operation engaged in deception and political subterfuge.
[03:41:38.673 --> 03:41:52.099]  The true culprits behind this are what are known as Discord Trannies, and that is not my own terminology or phrasing, but rather a group of young men who have chosen to instead spam the boards online on 4chan.
[03:41:52.939 --> 03:41:56.340]  To make sure that Trump is not elected president for a second term.
[03:41:56.580 --> 03:42:11.244]  While they're typically fanatics about communism and they really really enjoy the idea of a communist state, however you can see that someone meticulously took the time to make a variety of yang gang memes and post them all at once, which is extremely suspicious.
[03:42:11.704 --> 03:42:22.127]  After doing further research, I discovered the discord that would actually allow them to gather together and make sure that their psychological operation went into effect en masse at a certain time.
[03:42:22.307 --> 03:42:27.011]  Looking from an outside-in perspective on the memes, you see a lot of anti-Semitism within them.
[03:42:27.311 --> 03:42:30.554]  And this is completely true within these Discord groups.
[03:42:30.814 --> 03:42:41.802]  The release of documents several days ago on 4chan and 8chan were basically the game plan to influence the public discourse on the message boards.
[03:42:42.083 --> 03:42:44.344]  We see efforts to push Andrew Yang.
[03:42:45.085 --> 03:42:48.568]  When 4chan had looked into the Yang Gang meme phenomenon,
[03:42:49.384 --> 03:43:02.588]  In previous revolutions, some good, some bad, the revolutionaries funded themselves by robbing stagecoaches full of gold, or robbing trains full of silver, or basically going through the countryside and pillaging.
[03:43:19.724 --> 03:43:24.231]  Well, we've been blessed the 21st century in this great free market system that we've got.
[03:43:25.974 --> 03:43:33.346]  To be able to just use the free market and high quality products and the rules of commerce to go out and get great products.
[03:43:34.818 --> 03:43:41.961]  That people get great results from and then discount those products to you so that it becomes a total 360 win.
[03:43:42.541 --> 03:43:48.043]  And I obsess over that term that I coined years ago because that's really what I believe in.
[03:43:48.123 --> 03:43:52.685]  It's a non-zero-sum game where everybody basically benefits.
[03:43:52.765 --> 03:43:57.907]  It's beyond just symbiotic where everybody kind of works with each other and everybody makes it.
[03:43:58.187 --> 03:44:00.668]  This is where we have an even better future together.
[03:44:01.908 --> 03:44:03.149]  And so we're not robbing banks here.
[03:44:04.161 --> 03:44:07.021]  We're not engaged in criminal activity to fund our operations.
[03:44:08.379 --> 03:44:11.480]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we are engaged in good old-fashioned free market.
[03:44:11.820 --> 03:44:14.961]  It doesn't mean the whole world's free market, it doesn't mean America's perfect free market.
[03:44:15.582 --> 03:44:22.284]  We have socialism, we have communist tendencies, we have these parasitic systems nesting inside the free market capitalist system.
[03:44:22.784 --> 03:44:33.508]  But Infowars itself is a pretty much pure form of Americana free market capitalism, and your participation in it is a beautiful part of that.
[03:44:34.168 --> 03:44:35.189]  So, throughout the month,
[03:44:36.545 --> 03:44:45.850]  Of March, in the few weeks we have left, we're offering store-wide free shipping and 50% off all our best-selling supplements and a bunch of other huge specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:46.370 --> 03:44:48.911]  And again, InfoWarsStore.com is the main mothership site.
[03:44:49.492 --> 03:44:52.033]  InfoWarsLife.com will take you right to the supplement pages.
[03:44:52.413 --> 03:45:02.138]  Whether it's books, videos, non-gmo heirloom seeds, t-shirts, ball caps, whatever it is, it's high quality, it spreads the word, and it funds the Second American Revolution worldwide.
[03:45:03.624 --> 03:45:05.167]  A new habitat has appeared.
[03:45:06.268 --> 03:45:10.756]  Entirely designed and constructed by one species for its own purpose.
[03:45:13.881 --> 03:45:17.567]  These crevices contain the highest density of lizards in the world.
[03:45:19.392 --> 03:45:27.018]  And to early visitors, this new world was already home to First Nations people.
[03:45:28.699 --> 03:45:31.141]  I would argue that they're missing the forest for the trees.
[03:45:31.341 --> 03:45:39.026]  A young brain searches for understanding in slow stages, working out what things are and how they work.
[03:45:39.106 --> 03:45:44.190]  Out comes the tiny, underdeveloped little worm.
[03:45:46.330 --> 03:45:47.332]  We gotta do what we can.
[03:45:47.352 --> 03:45:48.073]  We always have.
[03:45:48.715 --> 03:45:51.541]  This is a male, and life here suits him well.
[03:45:56.111 --> 03:46:07.199]  This extraordinary creature is half blind, half deaf, and this is just about as fast as it can move.
[03:46:07.800 --> 03:46:13.544]  You might think that this is some kind of circus trick for which she's been specially trained, but not so.
[03:46:14.424 --> 03:46:17.867]  She is doing this entirely on her own initiative.
[03:46:17.887 --> 03:46:21.029]  She's seen others doing it, and she's copying.
[03:46:21.049 --> 03:46:23.070]  I don't feel no ways tired.
[03:46:24.151 --> 03:46:25.512]  I come too far.
[03:46:30.481 --> 03:46:34.363]  This male has gigantic testes, the largest in the world.
[03:46:34.603 --> 03:46:37.765]  They weigh a ton and produce gallons of sperm.
[03:46:39.205 --> 03:46:47.330]  You know, it is, uh, it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
[03:46:47.930 --> 03:46:48.910]  Because you'd be in jail.
[03:46:49.131 --> 03:46:49.831]  Secretary Clinton!
[03:47:06.178 --> 03:47:10.382]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.266 --> 03:47:19.391]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:22.074 --> 03:47:25.818]  On the message boards, we see efforts to push Andrew Yang.
[03:47:26.558 --> 03:47:30.042]  When Fortune had looked into the Yang Gang being phenomenon,
[03:47:30.971 --> 03:47:39.014]  They had discovered documents that were coordinated, gang gang memes, over the weekend, Friday, March the 8th, going in through the 12th.
[03:47:39.695 --> 03:47:43.416]  These descriptions outlined things in highly anti-Semitic terms.
[03:47:43.736 --> 03:47:52.980]  At the same time, you see the Daily Stormer release their support for Yang in an article titled, Making the Case for the Establishment of the Yang Dynasty.
[03:47:53.527 --> 03:48:02.613]  In the article, they outline Yang's appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast and comparing his warnings about automation to the Unabomber's manifesto.
[03:48:02.973 --> 03:48:07.596]  Then on Tuesday, you see the Daily Stormer write an additional article with support with Yang.
[03:48:08.377 --> 03:48:14.603]  Highlighting the meme releases that trended into the hashtag Omega.
[03:48:15.084 --> 03:48:19.928]  Making Israel great again through these memes that condemn the U.S.
[03:48:20.049 --> 03:48:27.556]  funding of Israel and celebrates their wishes for a gang to defund Israel and give the money to United States citizens.
[03:48:27.924 --> 03:48:30.065]  Sew discord within Trump's base.
[03:48:30.425 --> 03:48:34.367]  Sock puppet A to push narrative that Trump will drain the Israel swamp.
[03:48:34.767 --> 03:48:39.028]  Sock puppet B to push narrative that Trump is an ally to Israel.
[03:48:39.409 --> 03:48:47.372]  Color the website as hateful by pushing over-the-top racist and divisive posts that make no real contribution.
[03:48:48.052 --> 03:48:53.214]  People who advocate peaceful means should be condemned as Zionist shills.
[03:48:53.734 --> 03:48:55.535]  And you're getting disclosure coming up.
[03:48:56.135 --> 03:49:02.460]  There was a large effort to do a file dump of the Discord servers that appeared to be where these meetings were being coordinated from and within the conversations of it.
[03:49:20.535 --> 03:49:27.001]  They also unearthed coordinated raid instructions to the Bear Pants Salon each day of the raid.
[03:49:27.401 --> 03:49:33.887]  It appears someone got kicked out of the group and didn't get paid, so they leaked the docs out of spite.
[03:49:34.407 --> 03:49:42.074]  We noticed a bizarre header and footer on these documents, so we had a professional cryptanalyst and codebreaker analyze them.
[03:49:42.774 --> 03:49:52.220]  With more than a dollop of insanity, the author of The Attached gives it the subtitle, Confidential Stenography Used to Prevent Leakage.
[03:49:52.520 --> 03:50:04.948]  The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a publication dated to 1903 that was purported to have been the result of several Jewish elders with a dream of the fulfillment of Zionism.
[03:50:05.908 --> 03:50:13.234]  Another such document has very recently surfaced and was written and formatted to suggest it was produced by Jews.
[03:50:13.934 --> 03:50:19.558]  There isn't a Jew on Earth stupid enough to come up with a title as ludicrous as this.
[03:50:20.259 --> 03:50:30.386]  It is noted that Adolf Hitler references the fraudulent protocols in his book Mein Kampf, similar to the New Zealand shooter and modern white nationalist groups.
[03:50:31.207 --> 03:50:33.369]  Here is what Adolf Hitler had to say.
[03:50:34.049 --> 03:50:41.235]  Quote, I took all the social democratic pamphlets I could lay my hands on and sought the names of their authors, Jews.
[03:50:41.796 --> 03:50:48.941]  I noted the names of the leaders or trade union secretaries, the heads of organizations or street agitators.
[03:50:49.542 --> 03:50:52.064]  It was always the same gruesome picture.
[03:50:52.704 --> 03:51:00.471]  And so too was the attached set of documents produced by an updated cabal of neo-Nazi wannabes purporting to be Jews.
[03:51:01.732 --> 03:51:07.754]  A lot of people who identify with a growing trend, unfortunately, which is accelerationism.
[03:51:08.134 --> 03:51:24.381]  Accelerationism is the twisted philosophy that if one accelerates class conflict, pushes capitalism to its limits, oppresses the working class, and creates as much political conflict as possible, you can force about revolution and radical change.
[03:51:25.051 --> 03:51:29.434]  Which is to accelerate things to its inevitable point as quickly as possible.
[03:51:30.094 --> 03:51:39.620]  Their belief currently is that the United States is going to collapse and that we should do everything possible to make that as quickly as possible.
[03:51:40.101 --> 03:51:51.768]  Waking up to accelerationists shooting up a mosque that published a manifesto quite like, the gang gang means we're propagandin' on 4chan and other social media sites for the act of accelerationism.
[03:51:52.068 --> 03:51:56.411]  The gunman was live-streaming the killings at one mosque on social media.
[03:51:56.931 --> 03:52:03.596]  Under his name, online, is a racist manifesto claiming that white Christians are under threat from other religions and races.
[03:52:03.896 --> 03:52:16.244]  He posted his manifesto using many of the same talking points and memes and jokes and trolling that have been going on in message culture for the past several months and years.
[03:52:16.885 --> 03:52:21.628]  Well, having worked on a Nobel IAEA documentary about the Oklahoma City bombing, I can't help but be struck
[03:52:22.528 --> 03:52:30.091]  By the similarities of the media response to that attack and the recent crisis or massacre in New Zealand in Christchurch.
[03:52:31.752 --> 03:52:35.093]  At the time of the Oklahoma City bombing, there was a patriot movement in this country.
[03:52:35.133 --> 03:52:39.734]  People were talking about a restoration of the Constitution, the expansion of the police state powers.
[03:52:40.015 --> 03:52:43.456]  They were resisting the anti-terrorism legislation that was trying to be passed.
[03:52:44.056 --> 03:52:49.458]  After the Oklahoma City bombing, it completely silenced anybody that opposed the globalization agenda.
[03:52:51.670 --> 03:52:56.594]  Now, all Libertarians, Conservatives, the Republican Party themselves, they're basically terrorists.
[03:52:57.535 --> 03:52:58.176]  Here's the headline.
[03:52:58.216 --> 03:53:01.999]  Corporate media, McVeigh's anti-government sentiment, now mainstream in Republican Party.
[03:53:03.120 --> 03:53:08.205]  Imagine how this would hurt the globalists, because their secret weapon is false flag.
[03:53:08.505 --> 03:53:10.006]  It is their go-to zeitgeist.
[03:53:10.226 --> 03:53:11.868]  We've got to take that weapon away from them.
[03:53:15.040 --> 03:53:30.588]  Apparently, this has been something that's been set up and in the works for a very, very long time by the Deep State, and that essentially, these terror organizations or groups would use social media.
[03:53:30.788 --> 03:53:44.115]  Then later, social media can be scrutinized, and they could essentially say that we have to now make sure that everyone has a government-issued ID attached to every single social media account
[03:53:44.315 --> 03:53:54.993]  They're making their move for an internet ID to dial into banking so that, oh, ISIS can't recruit online when it's Hillary and Benghazi and the left that empowered ISIS.
[03:53:56.545 --> 03:54:03.973]  Alex Jones on Twitter posted this week what essentially is a video calling for people to get their battle rifles ready.
[03:54:04.333 --> 03:54:15.224]  I know a PR rollout when I'm seeing it and now CNN came out this morning and said Alex Jones is a domestic terrorist planning terror attacks with no links or no proof.
[03:54:15.625 --> 03:54:19.749]  But the fact that they're saying I'm calling for this when I never said it is chilling.
[03:54:21.084 --> 03:54:24.486]  Oliver Darcy tweeted on the day of the New Zealand shooting.
[03:54:24.706 --> 03:54:28.549]  You don't have to go to places like 4chan to see vile racist commentary.
[03:54:28.889 --> 03:54:41.977]  Just go to some of the far-right websites in the US and look at the comments, message boards, Breitbart, Gateway Pundit, InfoWars, many reprehensible comments from users on stories regarding the New Zealand attack.
[03:54:42.277 --> 03:54:45.719]  So he's pointing the finger here now at the websites
[03:54:46.139 --> 03:54:47.740]  Of Info Wars and Breitbart.
[03:54:48.041 --> 03:54:51.904]  Is he now trying to call for your website to be banned, Alex?
[03:54:52.344 --> 03:54:54.385]  It's not good enough to just ban you from Twitter.
[03:54:54.405 --> 03:54:57.388]  He wants to pull you off the internet altogether.
[03:54:57.408 --> 03:55:05.734]  And what's crazy is this is literally one of the directives that these leftist trollbot farms had this week.
[03:55:06.174 --> 03:55:07.656]  So what's going on?
[03:55:07.696 --> 03:55:11.799]  Why is Oliver Darcy following directives that this leftist trollbot farm is giving out?
[03:55:12.379 --> 03:55:19.225]  After the Christchurch shooting, the New Zealand government blocked sites that they claimed were spreading hateful material.
[03:55:19.525 --> 03:55:35.858]  The headline in the New York Times following the attack was New Zealand is going to institute harsh gun control measures, which is a strange headline following that attack because it is not my concern or the concern of the American people what the gun laws in New Zealand are, which by the way are very harsh.
[03:55:36.278 --> 03:55:43.807]  So those gun laws will only apply to those who already follow the gun laws, as is the case if they try to institute gun laws here in this country.
[03:55:43.827 --> 03:55:46.851]  If you don't have the Second Amendment, how can you protect the first?
[03:55:47.251 --> 03:55:51.256]  And in every country where they have disarmed the people, free speech is
[03:55:51.516 --> 03:55:51.616]  Yes.
[03:56:07.722 --> 03:56:10.844]  Being against what he thought is fulfilling what he wanted.
[03:56:10.864 --> 03:56:16.187]  But really Hillary Clinton was aware of this white nationalist underground movement.
[03:56:16.387 --> 03:56:18.769]  There will be trolls galore.
[03:56:19.149 --> 03:56:22.051]  These are actually manufactured trolls.
[03:56:22.331 --> 03:56:25.953]  It's an AstroTurf outrage machine of these paid trolls.
[03:56:26.313 --> 03:56:28.975]  It's part of a program called Breaking Barriers.
[03:56:29.355 --> 03:56:44.507]  As we see them become more mainstream, we see them adopting their own art style and genre, which is to remix vaporware, the art subculture of the alt-left, with fascistic Roman imagery.
[03:56:44.887 --> 03:56:49.350]  This trend was observed everywhere and had columns written about it.
[03:56:49.370 --> 03:56:54.054]  From Vice to Daily Beast, anyone would be partisanly critical to the fringe alt-right.
[03:56:54.454 --> 03:56:57.897]  The alt-right version being dubbed Fast Wave or Fascist Wave.
[03:56:58.357 --> 03:57:02.301]  This was to create a subculture to counter the Communist Vapor Wave.
[03:57:02.821 --> 03:57:06.465]  You now see both of these symbology and imagery combined together.
[03:57:06.945 --> 03:57:09.768]  Now that you see equally that the two groups are working together.
[03:57:09.788 --> 03:57:15.653]  It is also very important to notice that the New Zealand shooter
[03:57:21.386 --> 03:57:23.967]  We all feel bad for the people who were shot in New Zealand.
[03:57:24.027 --> 03:57:25.428]  It was a horrible, horrible act.
[03:57:25.929 --> 03:57:35.874]  What the media should not be doing is fulfilling the shooter's agenda, which was to trigger censorship, to trigger gun control, and to start, basically, a civil war.
[03:57:35.954 --> 03:57:36.915]  That's what he wanted.
[03:57:37.195 --> 03:57:38.216]  That's what he stated.
[03:57:38.236 --> 03:57:44.379]  And as the media cherry-picks his manifesto, for example, claiming that he is a Trump supporter, when the shooter
[03:57:45.680 --> 03:57:49.763]  Most abundantly clarified his position and said he did not support Trump at all.
[03:57:54.247 --> 03:58:02.233]  Thursday, March 21st, InfoWars is going to launch our longest continual broadcast for 50 hours.
[03:58:02.253 --> 03:58:10.419]  An emergency summit with the most powerful, informed guests out there on developing a plan of action.
[03:58:11.124 --> 03:58:19.469]  To stop Big Tech, the Democratic Party and others working with the UN and the EU from crushing our free speech collectively.
[03:58:19.950 --> 03:58:21.911]  We're going to show the history of censorship.
[03:58:22.391 --> 03:58:28.515]  It was also CNN that demanded that radio show host Alex Jones be silenced because Jeff Zucker didn't like what he was saying.
[03:58:28.835 --> 03:58:32.598]  CNN really must think we're all idiots giving themselves an award last week.
[03:58:33.079 --> 03:58:35.581]  CNN waged a long campaign against Jones.
[03:58:35.721 --> 03:58:36.241]  It worked.
[03:58:36.701 --> 03:58:39.364]  Jeff Zucker's silence indeed platformed his show.
[03:58:39.564 --> 03:58:41.826]  It was a stunning defeat for free speech.
[03:58:42.186 --> 03:58:45.348]  So naturally, Jeff Zucker just won the First Amendment award.
[03:58:46.409 --> 03:58:47.871]  It kicks off 8 a.m.
[03:58:48.191 --> 03:58:51.875]  with The David Knight Show this Thursday and runs till 10 a.m.
[03:58:52.296 --> 03:58:54.078]  live that Saturday.
[03:58:54.458 --> 03:58:56.200]  We're gonna have a bunch of surprise guests.
[03:58:56.240 --> 03:58:59.684]  We're gonna have Ask Me Anything special events, roundtable discussions.
