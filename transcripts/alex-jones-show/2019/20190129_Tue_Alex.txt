[00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.935]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:26.457 --> 00:00:31.572]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:49.637 --> 00:00:52.001]  I just talked to Roger Stone minutes ago.
[00:00:52.021 --> 00:01:00.715]  He came out of his arraignment pleading not guilty about 20 minutes ago and the paparazzi people were screaming at him so loud he couldn't do the press conference just like they drowned him out.
[00:01:02.944 --> 00:01:07.746]  Back last week when he got out of jail as well.
[00:01:08.747 --> 00:01:12.548]  So we're going to be talking to him as soon as he's able to get to a safe place.
[00:01:12.568 --> 00:01:17.010]  He's getting followed around by a bunch of hateful corporate paparazzi right now.
[00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.532]  We'll give you the latest on the ongoing giant witch hunt.
[00:01:21.492 --> 00:01:24.513]  Acting Attorney General Whitaker has come out yesterday.
[00:01:24.553 --> 00:01:26.994]  We've got that video coming up for you in the next segment.
[00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:30.336]  And he said that the investigation is coming to an end.
[00:01:31.374 --> 00:01:41.317]  But I predict that will only spur new non-Russia-related criminal investigations, just like you've already seen with Manafort and with Cohen and others.
[00:01:42.097 --> 00:01:52.641]  Particularly with Cohen, it was the special counsel, the director, as they call him, as Whitaker called him, shaking, talking about him yesterday like he's God.
[00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.518]  That broke down the fact that he supposedly is going to be finishing up his work.
[00:02:02.578 --> 00:02:08.083]  But it was Mueller who went to the New York FBI and had them open the investigation up on Cohen.
[00:02:08.924 --> 00:02:11.166]  That had nothing to do with Russiagate.
[00:02:12.608 --> 00:02:15.751]  Had to do, of course, with not paying for taxicab medallions.
[00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:18.173]  So that's what we're down to here.
[00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:21.639]  And I predict that the witch hunt is far from over.
[00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.981]  It's just about to metastasize into dozens of other fake investigations.
[00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:34.604]  And Congress, especially the House, run by the Democrats, have come out and they have openly said that.
[00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:38.566]  So tomorrow's news today, we're going to go to break here in just a few minutes.
[00:02:39.506 --> 00:02:43.428]  We're going to come right back with Roger Stone to give you a statement about what happened inside the courthouse.
[00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:50.209]  Any restrictions of any of the judge put upon him, what happened when he tried to leave, and more.
[00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:55.873]  In fact, speaking of the devil, we have Roger just now got on the line, so we'll go to him right now and hold him over.
[00:02:56.494 --> 00:02:57.995]  So, Roger, thanks for joining us.
[00:02:58.455 --> 00:03:05.041]  A lot happening on your whirlwind tour of all the major TV channels, but again, you were unable to speak today leaving the courthouse.
[00:03:06.192 --> 00:03:12.204]  Well, first of all, Alex, this is a world exclusive because no interviews are permitted in the courthouse.
[00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:16.232]  And while I would like to have made a statement outside to
[00:03:17.034 --> 00:03:19.156]  Announce that I pled not guilty.
[00:03:19.176 --> 00:03:26.341]  I was being shouted down by radical leftists and members of the fake news media.
[00:03:27.042 --> 00:03:30.485]  And there's no point in trying to speak when you can't be heard by anyone.
[00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:41.273]  So I prefer to be heard right here on InfoWars and later on tonight on the Laura Ingraham program and on other media who will stop and listen.
[00:03:41.313 --> 00:03:43.475]  I had a great interview with Man Cow this morning.
[00:03:44.115 --> 00:03:45.937]  By the way, Alex, he sends his regards.
[00:03:47.058 --> 00:03:52.670]  Uh, but, um, this was a routine proceeding, uh, at the government table.
[00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:53.431]  Jeannie Rhee.
[00:03:54.338 --> 00:04:10.651]  Hillary Clinton's personal henchwoman, the woman attorney who represented her in the stolen email case and represented the Clinton Foundation in a racketeering case, clear bias, clear conflict of interest.
[00:04:11.352 --> 00:04:17.777]  Aaron Zelinsky, right-hand man to Rod Rosenstein, recommended for his position
[00:04:18.587 --> 00:04:18.907]  Stay there, Roger.
[00:04:18.927 --> 00:04:19.428]  Stay there.
[00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:21.670]  Back in 60 seconds, you'll have the floor to go through this.
[00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.731]  And the good news is...
[00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:48.518]  Even non-Fox channels are starting to have to admit, Jeannie Ray that ran the foundation and covered up Hillary in Uranium One is one of the lead prosecutors?
[00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:55.165]  I mean, this is like having Captain Hook oversee stopping pirate raids or something.
[00:04:55.685 --> 00:05:02.052]  It's like having Long John Silvers, you know, running your anti-pirate operations, or having a giant fox guard the hen house.
[00:05:07.338 --> 00:05:10.059]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:16.262]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[00:05:16.822 --> 00:05:28.808]  Turbo Force from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[00:06:19.907 --> 00:06:20.688]  InfoWars.
[00:06:21.028 --> 00:06:22.530]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:06:31.912 --> 00:06:35.955]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:06:36.736 --> 00:06:38.177]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:38.438 --> 00:06:39.578]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:44.823]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:45.163 --> 00:06:53.290]  As I've said for many, many years, I don't know how this fight with the globalists is gonna end, but they're evil bastards and they deserve somebody to go head up against them.
[00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.513]  So I told them once and I told them a thousand times, you want to fight?
[00:06:58.054 --> 00:06:59.415]  You better believe you've got one.
[00:07:00.523 --> 00:07:03.204]  My only frustration is I can't fight hard enough like I'd like to.
[00:07:03.244 --> 00:07:04.965]  Well, tomorrow's news today.
[00:07:06.405 --> 00:07:18.730]  We first wrote the definitive article about iPhones ten years ago when they first came out that if you knew how to manipulate it, you could turn somebody's microphone on even without them knowing.
[00:07:19.844 --> 00:07:20.464]  It's on purpose.
[00:07:20.865 --> 00:07:21.986]  Now it's the top story in the country.
[00:07:22.386 --> 00:07:22.966]  That's coming up.
[00:07:23.006 --> 00:07:30.852]  We'll show you articles where we first wrote about this 10 years ago, specifically on the iPhones, 14 years ago and 13 years ago on computers in general.
[00:07:31.192 --> 00:07:31.753]  That's coming up.
[00:07:31.773 --> 00:07:33.934]  But first, talk about tomorrow's news.
[00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:37.237]  Today, ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone
[00:07:39.778 --> 00:07:42.482]  is giving us the world exclusive after his arraignment.
[00:07:42.542 --> 00:07:46.727]  There were hundreds of cameras and reporters out front just 30 minutes ago when he came out.
[00:07:47.508 --> 00:07:54.558]  But he was shouted down from the giant throng of reporters and the huge stand of more than 40 microphones.
[00:07:55.765 --> 00:07:59.126]  They screamed, you're a Russian agent, you're going to prison, lock him up.
[00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:02.427]  They did not want him to have his free speech to defend himself.
[00:08:03.027 --> 00:08:16.812]  And so, Owen Schroer and Roger were ready to make statements, their co-host, about the attack on the First Amendment, but that was stopped, even worse than what happened when he got out of the jail there in Florida on his own recognizance bond last Friday.
[00:08:18.306 --> 00:08:19.187]  Last Saturday morning.
[00:08:19.847 --> 00:08:31.294]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone is here to give us this world exclusive today on what really happened inside and what's coming next.
[00:08:31.334 --> 00:08:32.515]  So, Roger, thank you for joining us.
[00:08:33.924 --> 00:08:36.206]  Alex, this is my very first interview.
[00:08:37.107 --> 00:08:38.848]  Interviews are not allowed in the courthouse.
[00:08:39.488 --> 00:08:55.280]  I wanted very much to go outside and make a statement, but I was shouted down by crazed leftists who, of course, revere the First Amendment, and some members of the media shouting insulting questions before I could say a word.
[00:08:56.401 --> 00:09:01.865]  I want to speak someplace where I can actually be heard, not try to speak over people in
[00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:04.121]  I don't know.
[00:09:31.406 --> 00:09:34.509]  Roger, I know you're on the move with paparazzi following you.
[00:09:34.689 --> 00:09:42.517]  You haven't gotten a location to do Skype with us, but let's wait a moment to get to a better location so that we can actually hear what you have to say.
[00:09:42.537 --> 00:09:43.698]  Now go ahead and try again.
[00:09:43.718 --> 00:09:46.301]  You were saying that you were thankful to the federal marshals.
[00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:49.496]  Yes, hopefully that's a little better.
[00:09:49.817 --> 00:10:03.116]  I was grateful to the federal marshals and the protective services for helping me get safely to a car with my attorneys to leave what was a chaotic
[00:10:04.297 --> 00:10:22.283]  I'm also very grateful to the many InfoWarriors and other Trump supporters and patriots who showed up in support for me because I pled not guilty today in a very clear voice at the government's prosecution table.
[00:10:22.303 --> 00:10:25.384]  We had Jeannie Rhee smirking.
[00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:28.725]  She was Hillary Clinton's personal attorney in the
[00:10:29.452 --> 00:10:30.533]  We're good to go.
[00:10:44.984 --> 00:10:58.389]  Also at the table, Aaron Zielinski, formerly a special department counselor to Hillary Clinton's State Department and then top assistant to Rod Rosenstein in the U.S.
[00:10:58.409 --> 00:10:59.830]  Attorney's Office in Baltimore.
[00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.451]  His emails are among the emails
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:03.640]  That's right.
[00:11:26.383 --> 00:11:27.184]  We're good.
[00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:51.813]  Uh, had not been filed in time to permit him to appear before the court pro hoc vice.
[00:11:52.694 --> 00:11:56.335]  Uh, the government didn't object to his, uh, uh, be appearing.
[00:11:56.755 --> 00:11:57.916]  They could have waived him in.
[00:11:57.936 --> 00:11:59.877]  Uh, the magistrate declined.
[00:12:00.777 --> 00:12:05.620]  Um, so, but I was ably represented, um, and, uh, I pled not guilty.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.462]  I'm subject to the same travel restrictions and all other restrictions.
[00:12:11.547 --> 00:12:18.224]  Uh, for, uh, that were imposed by the, um, by the court in Florida on Friday.
[00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:41.324]  Um, uh, there was no suggestion of a gag order, but this would not have been the appropriate time that I suspect it will be coming from Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who essentially ordered torture for Paul Manafort, uh, to torture him, uh, and who has rejected, uh, every challenge to Robert Mueller's authority.
[00:12:41.945 --> 00:12:44.706]  She, at this point, will be the judge in my case.
[00:12:44.846 --> 00:12:45.867]  We'll see about that.
[00:12:47.228 --> 00:12:48.089]  This is a lynching.
[00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:53.431]  This is a legal lynching of me because I appear on InfoWars.
[00:12:53.912 --> 00:12:55.533]  Because I'm friends with Alex Jones.
[00:12:56.133 --> 00:13:00.555]  Because I support Donald Trump and I supported him for president and I still support him.
[00:13:01.415 --> 00:13:06.438]  Because I helped take down the evil queen, the foul-mouthed, short-tempered,
[00:13:07.422 --> 00:13:11.645]  Uh, uh, uh, self-centered kleptocrat, Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:11.665 --> 00:13:12.246]  War criminal.
[00:13:12.486 --> 00:13:13.987]  Uh, war criminal.
[00:13:14.007 --> 00:13:15.428]  Xeno, Xeno criminal.
[00:13:16.289 --> 00:13:18.651]  Uh, it is... Traitor who sold the nation out.
[00:13:18.711 --> 00:13:20.612]  I mean, we're gonna start listing her crimes.
[00:13:20.672 --> 00:13:21.273]  It takes a while.
[00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:26.277]  Uh, and the irony, of course, is that I'm charged with perjury.
[00:13:26.957 --> 00:13:29.279]  Lying before Congress, which I'm not guilty of.
[00:13:29.419 --> 00:13:29.799]  Comey.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:30.960]  Brennan.
[00:13:31.581 --> 00:13:32.121]  McCabe.
[00:13:32.882 --> 00:13:33.362]  Clapper.
[00:13:34.203 --> 00:13:35.784]  Uh, Hillary herself.
[00:13:36.718 --> 00:13:37.558]  Huma Abedin.
[00:13:38.219 --> 00:13:38.999]  Gerald Mills.
[00:13:39.699 --> 00:13:42.741]  These people did lie about material matters.
[00:13:43.221 --> 00:13:45.062]  About consequential matters.
[00:13:45.222 --> 00:13:47.423]  And we've broken that down, so let me ask you this, Roger.
[00:13:47.583 --> 00:13:49.584]  Why do they think they can get away with it?
[00:13:49.644 --> 00:13:52.385]  It was really an astounding Hannity last night.
[00:13:53.105 --> 00:13:57.807]  The way he pretty much teleprompter-free, ranged through everything, had you on.
[00:13:58.208 --> 00:14:05.431]  But then even Chris Christie had to admit, he's a former federal prosecutor as folks know, that this, the raid on you, this whole thing is a political witch hunt.
[00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:11.533]  That the Clintons did commit crimes, that the servers were illegal, that they've all been caught perjuring themselves to Congress.
[00:14:12.113 --> 00:14:19.796]  McCabe and Rosenstein all lied and said the president wasn't under espionage investigation as others had told him he was, as we told him he was.
[00:14:20.076 --> 00:14:24.478]  Turned out they lied to Congress and the president and the judiciary with fake warrants.
[00:14:24.618 --> 00:14:25.738]  I mean, we have them!
[00:14:26.379 --> 00:14:28.639]  This isn't catching the kid with the hand in the cookie jar.
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.481]  This is catching the kid putting the whole
[00:14:33.755 --> 00:14:36.818]  Well, the problem, of course, is that Donald Trump does not control
[00:14:42.708 --> 00:14:44.008]  His own Justice Department.
[00:14:44.108 --> 00:14:52.410]  It was announced last week that the Justice Department under Donald Trump intends to refile the Bundy case in Nevada, which is outrageous.
[00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.011]  They continue to do nothing about Uranium One.
[00:14:56.471 --> 00:15:00.032]  They continue to do nothing about the rogues gallery that you just mentioned.
[00:15:00.552 --> 00:15:06.733]  Christopher Wray, the FBI director who must have approved this over-the-top raid on my home,
[00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:08.133]  We're good to go.
[00:15:31.164 --> 00:15:36.389]  Roger Stone is giving us a world-exclusive, again world-exclusive, linked up on Infowars.com.
[00:15:36.429 --> 00:15:37.050]  Share this link.
[00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.171]  It will go viral.
[00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:42.034]  People need to actually hear from him because it's bigger than Roger, bigger than Infowars.
[00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:44.837]  It's about taking down Trump and this nationalist movement.
[00:15:45.257 --> 00:15:47.960]  I have not come to grips with how I'm supposed to announce this.
[00:16:09.757 --> 00:16:21.763]  And then that's how I always say, this is coming up and I announce it right there, but I need to really think about this and look at it carefully before I make the announcement because I'm not quite sure what's happening or what we should do, but we're not going to be able to expand.
[00:16:22.883 --> 00:16:24.464]  And if we're not expanding, that means we're contracting.
[00:16:25.505 --> 00:16:27.906]  And then I look up and I say, I haven't cut new ads in weeks.
[00:16:28.306 --> 00:16:29.607]  I don't promote the products we've got.
[00:16:29.627 --> 00:16:30.827]  So it's my fault.
[00:16:30.847 --> 00:16:32.188]  But at the same time, I just want to cover news.
[00:16:33.897 --> 00:16:42.321]  I just need everybody listening to understand this is history happening, and if you don't go buy the products, and if you don't routinely buy them, sign up for AutoShip to get fluoride-free toothpaste.
[00:16:42.421 --> 00:16:44.702]  It's concentrated, four to five o'clock, a little silver and iodine.
[00:16:44.802 --> 00:16:48.884]  And if you don't get our new TurboForce, that's beyond any energy drink you've ever had.
[00:16:48.964 --> 00:16:56.187]  It's healthy with all the trace elements and minerals and vitamin C and the amino acids and the organic caffeine and stimulants.
[00:16:56.247 --> 00:16:56.787]  It's incredible.
[00:16:56.847 --> 00:16:58.588]  TurboForce, 33% off out of the gate.
[00:16:58.708 --> 00:17:03.390]  If you don't go get the products, the best fish roll for adults, the best fish roll for kids, Honor Roll,
[00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:04.571]  We don't get the very best.
[00:17:04.631 --> 00:17:05.191]  It's the best!
[00:17:05.291 --> 00:17:08.854]  I go up to top firms and say, I want to go above the top brand in the country.
[00:17:08.914 --> 00:17:10.475]  They go, what, 1% so you can say that?
[00:17:10.575 --> 00:17:10.855]  No!
[00:17:11.615 --> 00:17:11.936]  50% above them.
[00:17:11.996 --> 00:17:13.417]  Well, that won't fit in the capsule.
[00:17:13.537 --> 00:17:15.178]  Okay, we're 20% above the very best.
[00:17:15.418 --> 00:17:16.299]  And we're lower priced!
[00:17:16.439 --> 00:17:18.500]  That's our body's turmeric.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.201]  Our fish oil.
[00:17:19.401 --> 00:17:19.921]  The best.
[00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:20.661]  The cleanest.
[00:17:20.782 --> 00:17:21.222]  The best.
[00:17:21.342 --> 00:17:21.862]  The cleanest.
[00:17:21.942 --> 00:17:25.705]  At a price lower than they sell Jeff Bezos at the damn Whole Foods.
[00:17:25.905 --> 00:17:31.829]  I'll tell you again, my job would be a lot easier if I didn't spend my time scrounging around for money.
[00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:34.512]  But you can sure as hell see that we're in the fight for our lives.
[00:17:34.552 --> 00:17:38.276]  So, you've all been committed to us and you've bought a ton of great products that you love.
[00:17:38.456 --> 00:17:41.139]  Average 5.8 star on third-party review sites.
[00:17:41.159 --> 00:17:48.768]  But, if I don't get up here and explain to people that it's do or die, people don't take action and I don't get the product.
[00:17:48.808 --> 00:17:48.948]  So...
[00:17:50.149 --> 00:17:51.090]  Here's what it comes down to.
[00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:54.052]  I don't want to cancel some of the shows we already have.
[00:17:54.213 --> 00:17:57.315]  And I sure as hell don't want to start curtailing how many reporters we have.
[00:17:57.355 --> 00:17:58.917]  We need more reporters.
[00:17:58.937 --> 00:17:59.597]  20 more reporters.
[00:17:59.917 --> 00:18:01.058]  I've got big plans.
[00:18:01.138 --> 00:18:02.059]  The enemy knows it.
[00:18:02.219 --> 00:18:03.661]  But I need money.
[00:18:03.901 --> 00:18:06.423]  All my assets is enough to run this place for three months.
[00:18:06.583 --> 00:18:08.765]  Again, I don't want the private jet airplane.
[00:18:09.165 --> 00:18:10.386]  I don't want the big mansions.
[00:18:10.426 --> 00:18:13.428]  I want to see the globalists in prison.
[00:18:13.828 --> 00:18:17.111]  And I want to see them not teaching five-year-olds how to put dresses on as little boys.
[00:18:17.451 --> 00:18:18.572]  And I want to defeat this whole thing.
[00:18:18.592 --> 00:18:21.534]  But I need cold, hard cash from a barrel head.
[00:18:21.554 --> 00:18:30.941]  And I need you to commit and say, I'm not giving money to the candy-ass church down the street that doesn't say anything about unborn babies and doesn't say anything about sexualization of children or rural government.
[00:18:31.061 --> 00:18:32.602]  I'm going to tithe every month
[00:18:32.802 --> 00:18:36.406]  To InfoWarsTore.com and I'm going to get products I need.
[00:18:36.627 --> 00:18:38.068]  I'm going to get things that are good.
[00:18:38.269 --> 00:18:39.210]  Buy books monthly.
[00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:40.351]  Buy videos monthly.
[00:18:40.491 --> 00:18:42.473]  After you're done watching them, donate them to the library.
[00:18:42.674 --> 00:18:43.415]  Hundreds will see it.
[00:18:43.495 --> 00:18:45.958]  Get the fish oil you need for your brain, your heart, your liver.
[00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:46.979]  Get it for your children.
[00:18:47.099 --> 00:18:53.046]  If you're in the military or law enforcement or want to work out hard or just want that turbo force energy, Turbo Force.
[00:18:53.206 --> 00:18:54.328]  There's nothing like it!
[00:18:54.428 --> 00:19:00.075]  It will be the number one next-level energy drink healthy alternative in the world if you just try it.
[00:19:00.235 --> 00:19:00.796]  It's simple.
[00:19:00.936 --> 00:19:02.438]  Other corporations don't do that.
[00:19:02.498 --> 00:19:08.546]  They go, we're gonna put it all in marketing, have a bunch of girls in swimsuits and NFL players say it's great, and then it's a bunch of crap.
[00:19:08.766 --> 00:19:09.988]  This is the best.
[00:19:10.128 --> 00:19:11.510]  This is TurboForce.
[00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.070]  That's not in competition with brain force.
[00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.611]  It's a nootropic with a little bit of energy.
[00:19:14.711 --> 00:19:15.711]  Knocks people's socks off.
[00:19:15.731 --> 00:19:17.131]  Because you never have the nootropic with the energy.
[00:19:17.231 --> 00:19:19.652]  This is everything with the nootropic and the energy.
[00:19:19.792 --> 00:19:22.513]  And quite frankly, most people should take a quarter to a half packet of it.
[00:19:22.553 --> 00:19:26.414]  Because I wanted to have the biggest, meanest, baddest thing out there that's healthy and clean.
[00:19:26.534 --> 00:19:28.874]  And it's just too damn Tyrannosaurus Rex.
[00:19:29.054 --> 00:19:31.995]  I mean, it is just fire-breathing amazing.
[00:19:32.075 --> 00:19:35.076]  So we did it again, thanks to the good Lord and the commitment to do it.
[00:19:35.196 --> 00:19:36.576]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:19:39.497 --> 00:19:43.680]  I mean, it's a contest between our wills, Soros' will, and your will!
[00:19:44.261 --> 00:19:51.647]  InfoWars is only a focal point, but if you focus on what we're doing and pray for us, we pray for you, we're together and we're unstoppable!
[00:20:06.099 --> 00:20:08.781]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:25.663 --> 00:20:31.988]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:33.790]  Well, it's a world exclusive.
[00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:44.699]  It wouldn't be a world exclusive, but the leftist mobs, hundreds of them out there, overpowered the hundreds of reporters, literally, when it came out of the federal courthouse, and wouldn't let him speak at a press conference.
[00:20:45.199 --> 00:20:48.862]  So he's here, Roger Stone, InfoWars.com talk show host.
[00:20:48.902 --> 00:20:51.805]  He hosts the War Room with Owen Schroyer, 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:20:51.925 --> 00:20:52.606]  every weekday.
[00:20:53.286 --> 00:20:55.887]  I love how the media keeps calling me saying, why'd you hire Roger?
[00:20:56.467 --> 00:20:57.568]  Because he has a lot of contacts.
[00:20:57.588 --> 00:21:01.589]  I mean, why was he a consultant and a paid contributor to Fox News for many years?
[00:21:02.009 --> 00:21:02.730]  Yes, he was.
[00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:04.530]  Because he's interesting.
[00:21:04.971 --> 00:21:06.291]  Because he knows a lot of people.
[00:21:06.771 --> 00:21:08.612]  And he's a good political correspondent.
[00:21:08.832 --> 00:21:11.613]  But again, they demonize all of our speech like it's dirty and bad.
[00:21:11.993 --> 00:21:13.274]  And the left is not the left.
[00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:15.431]  They are the murderers of speech.
[00:21:16.312 --> 00:21:18.894]  So they can then frame you and you can't defend yourself.
[00:21:19.374 --> 00:21:22.116]  They're true cowards, but he's here with the world exclusive.
[00:21:22.396 --> 00:21:27.840]  Now, Matthew Whitaker seemed sweaty, seemed nervous, seemed shaken yesterday.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:37.668]  The interim AG, while Robert Mueller's literal mentor, Mr. Burr, is prepared to be confirmed.
[00:21:38.542 --> 00:21:40.643]  This was the beginning of the Bush, H.W.
[00:21:40.683 --> 00:21:43.905]  Bush, CIA taking over the FBI dynasty in 1989.
[00:21:44.745 --> 00:21:48.066]  This is the guy from the CIA, worked directly under George Herbert Walker Bush.
[00:21:48.467 --> 00:21:49.687]  This is the guy that brought in Mueller.
[00:21:50.448 --> 00:21:52.929]  I mean, this is the Legion of Doom.
[00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:58.034]  And so Trump got tricked into that because Burr put out some memos criticizing Mueller.
[00:21:58.414 --> 00:21:59.435]  Total stage deal.
[00:21:59.456 --> 00:22:00.677]  Please don't throw me in the briar patch.
[00:22:01.037 --> 00:22:09.106]  So I want to get Rogers' take on Whitaker claiming that the investigation is winding down, but then we see all the news saying actually a bunch of new indictments are about to happen.
[00:22:09.126 --> 00:22:09.427]  Here it is.
[00:22:10.988 --> 00:22:36.079]  Briefed on the investigation and you know I look forward to Director Moeller delivering the final report and I really am not going to talk about open and ongoing investigation otherwise but you know sort of the statements that I've made were as a private citizen only with publicly available information and I you know I am I am comfortable that the decisions that were made are going to be
[00:22:37.339 --> 00:22:52.273]  Reviewed you know neither through the various means we have but right now you know the investigation is I think Close to being completed, and I hope that we can get the report from Director Mueller as soon as possible
[00:22:53.905 --> 00:23:17.948]  If I had to read the body language and the way he speaks compared to the way he normally does, very confidently, he's very nervous, he's not sure about what he's saying, they've given him conflicting info, but the president's pissed off so he's telling him everything's fine, and these 80 plus other fake investigations that were stirred up from Russiagate, that have nothing to do with Russiagate, are about to be launched, and then Mueller's going to put out a report, and then trigger a whole bunch of other fake investigations harassing everybody around Trump.
[00:23:18.188 --> 00:23:18.989]  What do you think, Roger Stone?
[00:23:19.949 --> 00:23:28.195]  Well, I think they're going to hand off a number of these to the Southern District of New York, which is a nest of left-wing Democrats that have not been replaced.
[00:23:28.876 --> 00:23:33.659]  You know, the president has not gotten control of large swaths of his own government.
[00:23:33.739 --> 00:23:42.205]  There are contingents within the Justice Department, within the courts, who are part of the resistance, and they know that
[00:23:43.928 --> 00:23:47.429]  They have to take me down in order to take Donald Trump down.
[00:23:48.169 --> 00:23:55.052]  They know that they have to take Infowars down because they don't want us to tell the American people what they're up to.
[00:23:56.272 --> 00:23:57.072]  It's insidious.
[00:23:57.452 --> 00:23:58.153]  It's ruthless.
[00:23:59.093 --> 00:24:01.934]  Alex, I'm facing potentially 45 years in jail.
[00:24:02.294 --> 00:24:06.975]  I'm 66, which Trevor Noah likes to make fun of.
[00:24:06.995 --> 00:24:08.716]  By the way, that guy's not funny at all.
[00:24:09.606 --> 00:24:14.509]  Uh, and then people saying, well, now Stone knows how black people feel.
[00:24:14.529 --> 00:24:15.329]  Let me say something.
[00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:23.273]  I've been speaking out against the 1994 crime bill that the Clintons foisted on black Americans for 15 years.
[00:24:23.874 --> 00:24:29.677]  I have been calling for sentencing reform, and I have spoken out against the ignominious
[00:24:30.498 --> 00:24:35.124]  You wrote a book about it three years before Trump actually did it.
[00:24:35.184 --> 00:24:36.687]  But notice, you and Trump don't get credit.
[00:24:37.247 --> 00:24:40.212]  You're the KKK for fighting the real KKK Hillary.
[00:24:41.816 --> 00:24:47.261]  I mean, it's extraordinary that these people don't know anything about me.
[00:24:48.102 --> 00:24:51.846]  You know, Stone is a—I'm a libertarian conservative.
[00:24:51.966 --> 00:24:52.987]  Everybody knows that.
[00:24:53.127 --> 00:25:01.394]  I've spoken and written—I bolted the party to support Gary Johnson because it was clear to me that Mitt Romney was a phony and a globalist.
[00:25:02.135 --> 00:25:05.238]  So, you know, they want to put you in a box.
[00:25:06.095 --> 00:25:09.958]  Everybody knows you're a nationalist, you're an anti-communist, but you're quite frankly very liberal.
[00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:30.294]  When it comes to things that adults do, but you're also pro-life for children at the same time.
[00:25:30.354 --> 00:25:36.238]  So, you want to guard children, protect innocents, but as an adult, you believe consenting adults have a right in this country to do whatever they want.
[00:25:36.518 --> 00:25:38.259]  People have a right to criticize it and say it's wrong.
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.260]  Everybody knows that.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.223]  They've miscast you as this big devil, but let's focus on the time we have left here.
[00:25:44.646 --> 00:25:45.807]  You just heard what Whitaker had to say.
[00:25:45.827 --> 00:25:46.787]  He seemed very, very nervous.
[00:25:46.807 --> 00:25:48.348]  It was very, very disconcerting.
[00:25:48.628 --> 00:25:51.010]  He called Mueller, Director Mueller, like he's God.
[00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:52.891]  This God-like creature.
[00:25:52.911 --> 00:25:57.453]  I'm glad to see Tucker Carlson and others now calling him that because that's what it is.
[00:25:57.473 --> 00:26:01.176]  I mean, it's a total joke with the left fawning at the police state's feet.
[00:26:01.996 --> 00:26:06.118]  And then, of course, you weren't gagged at this magistrate hearing, but you have another hearing coming up Friday.
[00:26:06.138 --> 00:26:06.759]  So tell us about that.
[00:26:08.052 --> 00:26:11.474]  Well, this is a pre-trial conference.
[00:26:11.734 --> 00:26:14.216]  Sooner or later, the government will move to gag me.
[00:26:14.636 --> 00:26:20.099]  But if I have a right to remain silent under the Constitution, I also have a right to defend myself.
[00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:30.545]  And I make a living writing and speaking here on InfoWars, writing at the Stone Cold Truth and at InfoWars, and at the Daily Caller, where I am the Men's Style Editor.
[00:26:31.245 --> 00:26:35.388]  So they would be depriving me of making a living if I am entirely gagged.
[00:26:36.008 --> 00:26:37.850]  So, we will oppose that.
[00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:44.876]  It's interesting that Paul Manafort's attorney did not oppose the gag order in court.
[00:26:44.956 --> 00:26:46.137]  I can't even understand that.
[00:26:46.217 --> 00:26:49.140]  But then, he didn't mount much of a public defense.
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:53.424]  I have been defending myself, and will, you know, from day one.
[00:26:54.965 --> 00:26:59.890]  It is extraordinary the way I look at it, Alex.
[00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.092]  I was arrested by CNN on
[00:27:02.927 --> 00:27:03.968]  That's a good point.
[00:27:14.983 --> 00:27:16.224]  It's a crime, it's a crime, and everybody knows it.
[00:27:16.284 --> 00:27:21.025]  So Roger, obviously you're going to be back via Skype on the War Room, you're going to be staying in D.C.
[00:27:21.166 --> 00:27:21.846]  a few days.
[00:27:21.866 --> 00:27:23.506]  Tell people about other court dates coming up.
[00:27:23.546 --> 00:27:24.227]  World exclusive info.
[00:27:40.604 --> 00:27:42.566]  That's really all we know at this time.
[00:27:43.487 --> 00:27:48.613]  I'm going to be meeting with my team of lawyers this afternoon to start plotting a legal strategy.
[00:27:49.053 --> 00:27:53.138]  I need people to go to StoneDefenseFund.com to pay for those lawyers.
[00:27:53.578 --> 00:27:54.960]  They're very expensive.
[00:27:56.141 --> 00:28:02.508]  I'm an unarmed man at this point in terms of the resources to fight the taxpayer-financed
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:10.944]  Four platoons of Ivy League left-wing smart-ass lawyers who want to lock me up for the rest of my life.
[00:28:11.024 --> 00:28:11.685]  And that's what this is.
[00:28:11.825 --> 00:28:12.685]  We're being punished.
[00:28:12.745 --> 00:28:14.546]  Infowars is being sued and attacked and lied about.
[00:28:14.566 --> 00:28:17.768]  They're trying to throw you in prison because we rallied America.
[00:28:18.108 --> 00:28:19.289]  The world's now rallying.
[00:28:19.429 --> 00:28:20.629]  Our listeners rallied America.
[00:28:20.649 --> 00:28:21.770]  It's our audience they fear.
[00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:28.735]  And if they can get rid of me and dissipate you and others, they think then everybody will just kind of break up and that that wave of resistance won't be there.
[00:28:28.775 --> 00:28:30.756]  They are gravely, gravely mistaken.

[00:31:15.786 --> 00:31:20.047]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:31:20.487 --> 00:31:23.728]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.

[00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:53.857]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:34:00.168]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:05.797 --> 00:34:08.159]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are tomorrow's news today.
[00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.521]  We are next week's news today.
[00:34:09.561 --> 00:34:11.122]  We're next year's news today.
[00:34:11.162 --> 00:34:12.684]  We're next decade's news today.
[00:34:12.704 --> 00:34:18.349]  I've been telling you how Trump should declare a national emergency on the border for the last two plus years.
[00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:29.060]  I've been saying for four months that it's imminent and I believe it will happen, if he does the right thing, in the next 20 days after this latest government restart elapses.
[00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:43.473]  I said that the government shutdown was the wrong way to go because the Democrats want to plunge the economy and that that would take billions out of the economy every week and would show insecurity.
[00:34:44.633 --> 00:34:52.515]  Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, everybody else, I'm not attacking, but they all went after Trump and said, show her who's boss, shut it down.
[00:34:54.454 --> 00:35:02.378]  Why not just circumvent her when you've got the authority with a classic national emergency on the border and just do that and say, see who's the boss lady?
[00:35:03.438 --> 00:35:10.681]  Now Trump's surrogates are going, wow, this 30-something day shutdown probably cost us $10 million.
[00:35:10.741 --> 00:35:12.982]  That cost double what we wanted on the wall.
[00:35:13.923 --> 00:35:15.604]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:18.205 --> 00:35:18.705]  Exactly.
[00:35:19.806 --> 00:35:22.467]  So Trump was right to
[00:35:24.318 --> 00:35:25.899]  Come out and say, OK, here's DACA.
[00:35:25.919 --> 00:35:26.599]  Here's everything you want.
[00:35:26.619 --> 00:35:28.000]  Because remember, he did that a year and a half ago.
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:30.722]  They said, no, we want no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[00:35:33.543 --> 00:35:33.904]  Remember that?
[00:35:36.165 --> 00:35:37.666]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[00:35:38.366 --> 00:35:42.809]  And so with the real American people, not the fake polls, folks really see through that.
[00:35:44.855 --> 00:35:53.677]  That's why in most polls of Hispanics, he's increased 19 to 25 points just in the last six months because people are actually hearing who Donald Trump is versus what they say.
[00:35:53.957 --> 00:35:55.738]  That he says all Mexicans are criminals.
[00:35:56.478 --> 00:36:00.139]  No, he said a lot of people coming up here illegally are their worst people, which is true.
[00:36:00.159 --> 00:36:04.800]  They're not sending their doctors or lawyers.
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.040]  Latin America is putting up a fence around Venezuela.
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:09.681]  They don't want their worst.
[00:36:10.421 --> 00:36:14.362]  Would you want 5 million people from Venezuela just showing up in your country?
[00:36:15.765 --> 00:36:18.966]  No, you wouldn't if you had any sanity and your country was more wealthy than them.
[00:36:19.906 --> 00:36:30.349]  So, you got Kamala Harris giving her first speech since she announced yesterday at an armed facility with armed guards and fences around her.
[00:36:30.989 --> 00:36:32.830]  This is a war on common sense.
[00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:35.511]  A war on reality.
[00:36:36.431 --> 00:36:43.593]  Because these people all live behind heavily armed guards with fences and walls and checkpoints
[00:36:45.162 --> 00:36:51.267]  And then they say the front door to our country and the back door of our country should not have any order.
[00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:55.410]  It's wild.
[00:36:56.131 --> 00:36:58.352]  She says, by the way, get rid of private insurance.
[00:36:58.372 --> 00:36:58.873]  Everything's free.
[00:36:58.893 --> 00:37:10.582]  So you're having a race to the far extreme left by Alexandria Cortez and by Harris and by Pocahontas and by Bernie Sanders.
[00:37:13.012 --> 00:37:14.194]  And they're showing you who they really are.
[00:37:14.334 --> 00:37:21.665]  And just the free health care would be the entire federal budget every year and then some.
[00:37:23.087 --> 00:37:24.429]  And of course it'll drive prices up too.
[00:37:26.169 --> 00:37:28.471]  Of course, you know who's going to administer the new national health care?
[00:37:28.491 --> 00:37:29.691]  There won't be insurance anymore.
[00:37:30.072 --> 00:37:38.637]  The big insurance companies actually wrote this years ago, that once they bankrupted things with the Obamacare, it was meant to totally bankrupt things and make them triple in prices.
[00:37:39.098 --> 00:37:41.479]  You would then beg for the other solution.
[00:37:41.499 --> 00:37:44.962]  Remember, Ezekiel Emanuel said this on Fox News and CNN.
[00:37:45.362 --> 00:37:46.683]  I played the clip probably a hundred times.
[00:37:47.183 --> 00:37:48.144]  I bet it's still on YouTube.
[00:37:48.164 --> 00:37:54.108]  Let's see if we can find Ezekiel Emanuel admits Obamacare is meant to bankrupt, create single payer.
[00:37:55.353 --> 00:38:06.745]  But then you've got four insurance companies, foreign owned, against hundreds of others that aren't, who don't want competition, and who, ladies and gentlemen, want a monopoly.
[00:38:07.726 --> 00:38:13.993]  And then they will administer the government funds that everyone has, and the taxes you pay.
[00:38:15.074 --> 00:38:16.276]  Oh, you'll still be paying for health care.
[00:38:16.296 --> 00:38:17.357]  You're going to pay dearly.
[00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:20.491]  So it's amazing.
[00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:32.323]  It's absolutely amazing to have Ezekiel Emanuel, who helped write it with Jonathan Gruber, on Fox News saying, it's not meant to work.
[00:38:32.483 --> 00:38:36.026]  It's going to get rid of the insurance system, as we know, and bring in single payer.
[00:38:37.207 --> 00:38:38.128]  So there you are.
[00:38:39.029 --> 00:38:40.611]  And they're doing it, and they're pushing it.
[00:38:41.312 --> 00:38:43.494]  And I'm not bashing all the Republicans.
[00:38:45.472 --> 00:38:52.397]  Who have been establishment in the past and are now acting like they're the super hardcore vanguard of the cutting edge for America, criticizing Trump.
[00:38:52.457 --> 00:38:56.120]  I'm not just defending Trump because I like to defend Trump.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.042]  I get attacked when I defend Trump from every side.
[00:38:59.462 --> 00:39:05.767]  It's that he shouldn't have done the emergency the way he did it, shutting the government down.
[00:39:06.267 --> 00:39:09.029]  That's an emergency that puts the ball in Pelosi's court.
[00:39:11.011 --> 00:39:12.512]  A government shutdown is an emergency.
[00:39:13.456 --> 00:39:18.038]  When you've got the executive power to do the emergency and cut her out of the loop and do whatever you want.
[00:39:18.178 --> 00:39:19.939]  Oh, sir, the courts will sue you.
[00:39:21.959 --> 00:39:23.640]  A president can ignore courts.
[00:39:25.741 --> 00:39:27.782]  Only the Congress should be the judge with an impeachment.
[00:39:28.662 --> 00:39:31.823]  Most presidents in our past ignored courts.
[00:39:33.744 --> 00:39:34.784]  Unless it's the Supreme Court.
[00:39:35.004 --> 00:39:40.887]  And the Supreme Court, even though all these other night circuits and things have voted against Trump every time, every time it gets to the Supreme Court,
[00:39:41.667 --> 00:39:46.928]  In just a few months, it's unanimous because it's in the law when he banned people from seven countries.
[00:39:47.968 --> 00:39:50.349]  I'm going to go to break and come back with the biggest news of the day, though.
[00:39:52.709 --> 00:40:04.831]  I'm going to come back and get to the biggest news of the day, ladies and gentlemen, that's so incredibly vital because it's why they want us off the air.
[00:40:05.672 --> 00:40:06.732]  It's why they want to shut down.
[00:40:07.708 --> 00:40:10.689]  And it's because InfoWars credibility is so high.
[00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:12.629]  We exposed the world government.
[00:40:12.649 --> 00:40:14.269]  We exposed the planetary system.
[00:40:14.489 --> 00:40:17.550]  We exposed the 1776 reboot resistance.
[00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:25.712]  We exposed the Panopticon surveillance grid of all the systems spying and tracking in real time and them lying to us about all of it.
[00:40:25.952 --> 00:40:29.172]  We told you exactly how the whole thing operated and worked.
[00:40:29.712 --> 00:40:30.513]  We did our studies.
[00:40:31.913 --> 00:40:37.294]  And now... And now...
[00:40:40.256 --> 00:40:56.202]  We have... What happens, guys, sometimes is they talk to me and tell me they have clips and things ready, and then I don't hear what they say, and I kind of hit the cough button and go, you know, hey, tell me what you say, and then they're off doing something, so I have to kind of, like, wait a while to tell you what's coming up.
[00:40:56.322 --> 00:41:04.265]  And I'm not mad, it's just part of me directing this show live on air, it's one of the things that hiccups me and stuff, and it just, it's the thing that makes me want to have a heart attack sometimes.
[00:41:05.145 --> 00:41:08.326]  But I'm going to refocus here, just come back with it for you.
[00:41:13.461 --> 00:41:19.426]  As I was saying, they want to shut us down because they know we're telling the truth.
[00:41:20.707 --> 00:41:21.808]  And they know we can stop them.
[00:41:22.229 --> 00:41:26.492]  And they're a bunch of arrogant bastards that love to brag about the crimes they've committed against you and your family.
[00:41:26.912 --> 00:41:30.215]  So we do have the Ezekiel Emanuel clip I was speaking about.
[00:41:30.235 --> 00:41:30.856]  Good job getting it.
[00:41:30.876 --> 00:41:31.156]  Here it is.
[00:41:35.147 --> 00:41:38.469]  People who knew the law as it was being written knew the president wasn't telling the truth.
[00:41:38.529 --> 00:41:41.591]  The grandfather provision written into the law itself was too narrow.
[00:41:41.871 --> 00:41:46.274]  And frankly, they wrote a regulation intentionally trying to get people out of the individual market.
[00:41:46.554 --> 00:41:50.916]  They want the people to go into the exchanges because there's a lot of people in the individual market.
[00:41:51.117 --> 00:41:55.459]  The whole point of the exchanges is to close down the individual insurance market over time.
[00:41:55.499 --> 00:41:59.021]  They wanted to move millions of people into the exchanges.
[00:41:59.341 --> 00:42:03.284]  Insurance companies don't like the individual market as it's constructed.
[00:42:03.584 --> 00:42:21.009]  So they see the future where you don't have any choice and you pay whatever they want, triple prices, and then now all these different surgeries and different options and things are removed and you don't get them.
[00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:26.551]  And only the ultra-rich actually get second-tier, high-quality, private clinic healthcare.
[00:42:27.586 --> 00:42:28.407]  That's what Europe does.
[00:42:28.768 --> 00:42:29.629]  That's what Canada does.
[00:42:29.649 --> 00:42:32.072]  And unless you're rich, you can't get access.
[00:42:32.092 --> 00:42:39.161]  You've got to get permission, by the way, from the state-run medical systems in the UK to go get the higher tier of private care.
[00:42:40.602 --> 00:42:42.224]  So there they are telling you the plan all along.
[00:42:42.525 --> 00:42:45.909]  And now here comes the Pied Pipers of Sanders,
[00:42:46.992 --> 00:42:53.715]  And Harris, and Cortez, and all of them saying you're about to get free health care, free college, free everything.
[00:42:54.255 --> 00:42:57.356]  And the third world's collapsing and racing towards America for their free lunch.
[00:42:58.236 --> 00:43:02.118]  And a decade into it will be worse than Venezuela, and the globalists will take the money to Switzerland.
[00:43:03.178 --> 00:43:07.380]  Imagine if InfoWars hadn't been here to expose global government.
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.162]  To expose their plan to implode national sovereignty and nation's borders.
[00:43:13.286 --> 00:43:21.011]  Imagine if the lights had been turned off all those years and the incredibly important topics we talk about hadn't been discussed.
[00:43:22.592 --> 00:43:26.214]  But it's because of you doing that over the years that we're here.
[00:43:26.954 --> 00:43:28.435]  And that's not some platitude.
[00:43:28.475 --> 00:43:29.616]  That's not some pat on the back.
[00:43:30.817 --> 00:43:36.700]  That is the humble recognition that you are the sea on which all of us sail.
[00:43:38.401 --> 00:43:38.962]  I'm the sea.
[00:43:39.122 --> 00:43:39.722]  You're the sea.
[00:43:40.262 --> 00:43:40.743]  I'm the wind.
[00:43:42.423 --> 00:43:43.063]  You're the wind.
[00:43:43.203 --> 00:43:45.524]  We are all the sails together in this.
[00:43:45.604 --> 00:43:53.385]  But if you hadn't resonated with what we talked about and what we did, if you hadn't prayed for us and spread the word and supported us, we wouldn't be here.
[00:43:53.985 --> 00:44:07.828]  If you hadn't been faithful in our shared destiny together, we wouldn't have already had these successes and nationalism exploding across the world and all the incredible positive things happening that have unfolded.
[00:44:09.529 --> 00:44:10.729]  But because of you, we've done that.
[00:44:11.684 --> 00:44:12.404]  There's an equation.
[00:44:13.465 --> 00:44:18.566]  If you spread the word about InfoWars and the articles, the videos, the links, we get around the enemy.
[00:44:19.267 --> 00:44:25.309]  And if you fund the information we're producing, it all comes together.
[00:44:25.949 --> 00:44:27.890]  But it comes down to that, chicken or the egg.
[00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:39.454]  If you don't fund the seed money to keep InfoWars on the air and to fight against the fake lawsuits and the attacks of Soros and Hillary and others, we won't have the information to put on air for all of you to spread.
[00:44:40.345 --> 00:44:47.467]  So each one is just as important, but the most critical point the enemy understands is cutting the funding off.
[00:44:48.767 --> 00:44:51.948]  They don't want to have us be live on air while all this unfolds.
[00:44:53.388 --> 00:44:59.230]  They don't want to have us be here while the globalists push their entire world government agenda and everything we've talked about comes true.
[00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:06.032]  They don't want us here where they try to assassinate nationalist and populist leaders and while they overrun Christian countries with radical Islamists.
[00:45:06.412 --> 00:45:07.192]  They want us off the air.
[00:45:09.335 --> 00:45:12.356]  That's why I am in your hands, you're in my hands.
[00:45:12.736 --> 00:45:16.577]  If I give up, if I back down, if I waver, it's a big victory for the globalists.
[00:45:17.398 --> 00:45:20.899]  And if you back down, if you waver, it's a big victory for them as well.
[00:45:22.039 --> 00:45:24.780]  It's truly a life and death struggle.
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.941]  So all I'm going to say in closing is this.
[00:45:27.941 --> 00:45:29.381]  Our destinies are bound forever.
[00:45:30.962 --> 00:45:31.102]  And
[00:45:32.802 --> 00:45:37.004]  Doing something this epic almost feels sick to say, hey, come give me your money.
[00:45:37.825 --> 00:45:39.406]  But you've seen what I've done with your money.
[00:45:39.646 --> 00:45:42.768]  I have waged war, fearlessly and tirelessly.
[00:45:42.928 --> 00:45:44.629]  I have dominated globalists.
[00:45:44.729 --> 00:45:46.149]  I have overrun their emplacements.
[00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:51.232]  We have spread the message of liberty in 1776 worldwide, and we are committed to that destiny.
[00:45:51.712 --> 00:45:54.354]  And so with pride, I tell you, financially support us.
[00:45:55.094 --> 00:45:59.136]  Any other war chief in a fight for freedom would just say, support me, give me the funding now.
[00:45:59.337 --> 00:45:59.717]  I say,
[00:46:01.206 --> 00:46:02.726]  Get products for the best out there.
[00:46:03.987 --> 00:46:05.047]  Win-win situation.
[00:46:05.287 --> 00:46:07.008]  Fund us, and we're gonna stop altogether.
[00:46:07.568 --> 00:46:10.889]  If we don't do that, there's no future, and we have no shared destiny.
[00:46:11.929 --> 00:46:19.372]  I'm very sad that Supermill Vitality, our flagship product, is no longer available when this sells out, because we can't get the wild, crafted herbs.
[00:46:19.892 --> 00:46:24.333]  The process it goes through is so organic, like making of wine, that it can't be produced anymore.
[00:46:25.073 --> 00:46:26.174]  So that's why it's the last run.
[00:46:27.213 --> 00:46:32.460]  It's available 50% off, even though it's our last run, at Inforestore.com, because I want you to experience it before it's gone.
[00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:35.311]  But whatever you do, pray for InfoWars.
[00:46:35.671 --> 00:46:37.433]  Spread the articles, spread the links, spread the videos.
[00:46:37.733 --> 00:46:40.695]  Because without you, we are going to basically be destroyed.
[00:46:41.195 --> 00:46:43.777]  But with your support, together we all go into the future.
[00:46:44.157 --> 00:46:52.802]  Whatever you do, just remember that the power of you, via word of mouth, speaking out and taking action, is the most powerful thing in the universe, next to God.
[00:46:53.543 --> 00:46:58.526]  And for your support, and your undying prayers, I thank you, and I salute you.
[00:46:58.546 --> 00:47:01.007]  But more importantly, we are bound, and I love you.
[00:47:01.568 --> 00:47:01.968]  So thank you.
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:11.043]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:17.407 --> 00:47:25.111]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[00:47:26.692 --> 00:47:28.613]  I'm a friend of thunder.
[00:47:28.894 --> 00:47:33.436]  Friend, is it any wonder lightning strikes me?
[00:47:37.137 --> 00:47:38.537]  Well, that's the truth.
[00:47:38.577 --> 00:47:43.499]  We have some really big developments here after almost two years.
[00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:47.040]  Infamy, zeal for carnage inspired Vegas shooter.
[00:48:04.845 --> 00:48:07.929]  We've got this giant whitewash that injured almost 900 people.
[00:48:09.671 --> 00:48:10.892]  Killing a whole bunch of others.
[00:48:11.834 --> 00:48:12.254]  Now out.
[00:48:12.314 --> 00:48:13.596]  And I know the inside story of it.
[00:48:13.616 --> 00:48:15.118]  I had to sign non-disclosures and things.
[00:48:16.735 --> 00:48:28.923]  For the videos I was shown, the things I was shown from around the country, what I was told also by FBI people that were on the scene, that it was an Islamic gun deal gone bad.
[00:48:28.963 --> 00:48:30.144]  It turns out that's all true.
[00:48:30.764 --> 00:48:34.467]  But now we've got the supposed final report and it is a load of baloney.
[00:48:35.127 --> 00:48:35.888]  So that's coming up.
[00:48:36.028 --> 00:48:38.510]  Now, I've been talking about this for a long, long time.
[00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:42.692]  And so regular listeners are going to be, OK, yeah, we know about this.
[00:48:42.852 --> 00:48:43.473]  You know about it.
[00:48:44.133 --> 00:48:44.874]  Why are we covering it?
[00:48:45.959 --> 00:48:51.202]  It's because we have all the original documents, all the original articles going back 14 years ago.
[00:48:52.923 --> 00:48:56.965]  It's the first time that we can find that we documented it.
[00:48:57.085 --> 00:49:07.971]  I know I did it earlier than that, actually 20 years ago, when I was approached by NSA whistleblowers at book signings and
[00:49:08.985 --> 00:49:13.586]  The speeches I gave that turned out to be real former NSA people and others.
[00:49:13.666 --> 00:49:15.627]  They told me exactly what was already going on.
[00:49:16.767 --> 00:49:17.527]  So I talked about it.
[00:49:17.987 --> 00:49:24.209]  And I had famous authors on as well who'd written about the NSA and the CIA.
[00:49:24.409 --> 00:49:29.530]  So very early we've been exposing this, but there's an article from September 8, 2006.
[00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:33.951]  Government industry to use computer microphones to spy on 150 million Americans.
[00:49:34.491 --> 00:49:36.392]  And it goes through their actual admissions.
[00:49:37.452 --> 00:49:37.592]  So.
[00:49:38.908 --> 00:49:41.229]  Let's move into the biggest news now today.
[00:49:41.649 --> 00:49:42.289]  Oh my gosh!
[00:49:42.369 --> 00:49:51.912]  Big, giant, world-exclusive New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, Apple FaceTime allows people to call it and just hit two buttons.
[00:49:52.492 --> 00:49:58.074]  And even if you don't pick up, it turns on the microphone and the camera inside your house.
[00:49:59.675 --> 00:50:01.475]  Folks, they build that in there on purpose.
[00:50:01.495 --> 00:50:06.857]  The FBI had the phone companies set up systems where they can call you
[00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:22.934]  But even if you don't pick up in the old classic rotary phones and dial phones, landlines, and they just activate a special tone and it makes the phone not, not, not pick up.
[00:50:23.134 --> 00:50:23.754]  It picks up.
[00:50:24.734 --> 00:50:27.955]  So we're just learning about all these back doors.
[00:50:28.215 --> 00:50:31.016]  We're just learning and they're throwing it in our face.
[00:50:31.076 --> 00:50:32.496]  But I'm going to go over some of the history of this.
[00:50:33.257 --> 00:50:34.797]  It's in the terms of service, folks.
[00:50:37.045 --> 00:50:38.586]  And it's not just Apple that's doing this.
[00:50:38.626 --> 00:50:49.750]  So when Apple says, what happens on your iPhone stays in your iPhone, well, fundamentally, that is like saying, black is white, white is black, down is up, two plus two equals a million.
[00:50:52.491 --> 00:50:58.634]  The architecture's all moved towards cloud, where your data's somewhere else, and it's constantly getting hacked.
[00:51:00.094 --> 00:51:01.675]  This has been designed like this.
[00:51:03.055 --> 00:51:04.276]  So we'll talk more about it in a moment.
[00:51:06.157 --> 00:51:06.257]  Now,
[00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:20.865]  I'm going to just pull back here because I tend to get on air and get busy covering issues and then make promoting products and selling products kind of a side issue.
[00:51:22.686 --> 00:51:30.715]  And as long as I've got enough money coming in to operate the operation, I have a tendency to not build up reserves that we obviously definitely need.
[00:51:32.691 --> 00:51:36.552]  But bigger than that, we have products that everyone absolutely needs.
[00:51:37.213 --> 00:51:38.593]  We have the best supplements.
[00:51:39.253 --> 00:51:42.555]  We have the best water filtration and air filtration.
[00:51:43.375 --> 00:51:46.376]  We have the best non-GMO heirloom seeds, widest selection.
[00:51:46.836 --> 00:51:52.158]  We have the best shortwave radios and emergency gear and optics and so much more.
[00:51:52.639 --> 00:51:58.561]  Whatever is the best quality product out there for the best price, whether it's storable foods or whether it's fish oil,
[00:51:59.471 --> 00:52:04.572]  Or whether it's next level energy and focus drinks like TurboForce, we have it.
[00:52:05.712 --> 00:52:08.833]  And so, if you're into supplements, these are the best.
[00:52:09.933 --> 00:52:18.654]  If you know that you don't want your kids drinking glyphosate and all the crap in the tap water, then for heaven's sakes, get an Electipure Pro or an Electipure System or a ProPure System.
[00:52:18.674 --> 00:52:24.215]  They're both excellent gravity-fed water filtration systems, very easy to use, do tens of thousands of gallons apiece.
[00:52:25.035 --> 00:52:25.475]  Go there.
[00:52:25.855 --> 00:52:26.336]  Shop there.
[00:52:26.436 --> 00:52:27.676]  I want to thank those of you that have.
[00:52:27.776 --> 00:52:28.316]  It's amazing.
[00:52:28.356 --> 00:52:28.676]  Thank you.
[00:52:29.636 --> 00:52:31.998]  But this is a fundamental war against you and your family.
[00:52:32.718 --> 00:52:35.140]  They are literally trying to break the independent press in this country.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:48.048]  I told you when I got banned seven months ago that soon everything questioning the establishment would be banned, then liberals would be banned, and then all you would have on YouTube is basically Netflix, a few hundred providers, maybe a few thousand.
[00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:54.493]  They now have announced that and say that it's not going to be YouTube anymore, that everybody's going to be blocked and totally shadow banned.
[00:52:56.041 --> 00:53:07.206]  If you question anything, you question war, you question open borders, you question vaccines, you question politicians, only the establishment's going to be hurt.
[00:53:08.287 --> 00:53:15.110]  There's a deal with mainstream media to work as the police dog with the big tech companies to supposedly in this alliance they have.
[00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:23.333]  And part of that is so that big media doesn't report on all the illegal surveillance and activity that big tech's involved in.
[00:53:23.393 --> 00:53:32.977]  So it's a trifecta of corrupt government, with corrupt big tech, and corrupt dying corporate media, all triangulating in on the American people.
[00:53:33.457 --> 00:53:35.998]  So now it's, oh, ban Alex Jones for fake reasons.
[00:53:37.299 --> 00:53:38.419]  Make up while we're banning him.
[00:53:38.659 --> 00:53:39.520]  Say he's a bad guy.
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:41.360]  Silence him so he can't speak back to us.
[00:53:43.561 --> 00:53:45.022]  And then it's suddenly everybody.
[00:53:46.448 --> 00:53:48.930]  And then it's, oh, you can't type that on your phone.
[00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:50.411]  You can't go to that website.
[00:53:51.592 --> 00:53:55.995]  Microsoft and others are announcing this consortium literally run by elements of the U.S.
[00:53:56.035 --> 00:54:01.540]  government and a consortium of private groups under NewsGuard.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.501]  Oh, it's protecting you, NewsGuard.
[00:54:04.342 --> 00:54:12.908]  And it's a consortium of all these horrible groups in your phone, live time, watching where you go and what you do and sending you messages and pop-ups.
[00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:16.091]  That launches next month.
[00:54:18.086 --> 00:54:18.786]  Now do you understand?
[00:54:18.806 --> 00:54:21.608]  People are like, well, that's unbelievable.
[00:54:21.908 --> 00:54:34.295]  Just like I told you, with the actual internal prospectuses from Apple executives and Google executives and others, 14, 15 years ago, saying this is the future.
[00:54:35.416 --> 00:54:36.937]  I showed my wife this this weekend.
[00:54:36.957 --> 00:54:38.978]  We need to come in and do some of this just on air.
[00:54:40.546 --> 00:54:42.987]  And I said, watch, let's talk about Louis Vuitton bags.
[00:54:43.007 --> 00:54:44.307]  We've never talked about Louis Vuitton bags.
[00:54:44.327 --> 00:54:45.427]  You don't have Louis Vuitton bags.
[00:54:45.447 --> 00:54:46.788]  You don't want Louis Vuitton bags.
[00:54:47.268 --> 00:54:51.269]  Let's talk about Louis Vuitton bags because they've got microphones listening all the time on the phones.
[00:54:51.969 --> 00:54:56.510]  And then it will watch pop-up ads on news sites and others we go to in a couple hours.
[00:54:56.950 --> 00:55:00.811]  Once they process, every few hours I've noticed, they process all the keywords you've said.
[00:55:02.318 --> 00:55:04.140]  How much you're coughing, how fast you're breathing.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.241]  If you have a brain tumor, they monitor that.
[00:55:06.281 --> 00:55:07.162]  That's in the news today.
[00:55:07.823 --> 00:55:09.204]  How many breaths a minute you have.
[00:55:10.245 --> 00:55:10.565]  Everything.
[00:55:10.865 --> 00:55:12.467]  It all goes into big AI computers.
[00:55:13.187 --> 00:55:18.312]  And sure enough, two hours later, she goes, oh my god, I didn't type in Louis Vuitton.
[00:55:19.033 --> 00:55:21.034]  I'm on the New York Times and there's a Louis Vuitton ad.
[00:55:21.054 --> 00:55:21.875]  And I said, yeah, watch.
[00:55:22.055 --> 00:55:23.356]  Let me go to just a random newspaper.
[00:55:23.597 --> 00:55:24.097]  I go to it.
[00:55:24.557 --> 00:55:24.898]  Not there.
[00:55:24.918 --> 00:55:25.438]  Go to the next one.
[00:55:25.458 --> 00:55:25.658]  Boom.
[00:55:25.698 --> 00:55:26.159]  Louis Vuitton.
[00:55:28.184 --> 00:55:29.564]  Now, they're admittedly doing it.
[00:55:29.584 --> 00:55:32.925]  But you need to understand, they aren't listening to you in live time.
[00:55:33.206 --> 00:55:38.847]  And the way mainstream corporate media does this, decades after I tell you, is say, oh, are smartphones listening and targeting us with ads?
[00:55:39.667 --> 00:55:41.628]  And then, of course, their own internal documents say they are.
[00:55:42.368 --> 00:55:44.709]  But notice how the media is just easing you into it.
[00:55:46.049 --> 00:55:46.870]  So here's some of the articles.
[00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:52.271]  Major iPhone FaceTime bug lets you hear the audio of the person you're calling before they pick up.
[00:55:53.211 --> 00:55:55.112]  And even if they don't pick up, it lets you listen.
[00:55:56.895 --> 00:55:58.636]  Well, that's mainstream news.
[00:55:58.696 --> 00:55:59.377]  It must be true.
[00:55:59.457 --> 00:55:59.717]  It is.
[00:56:00.117 --> 00:56:04.941]  FaceTime bug lets iPhone users eavesdrop in a stumble for Apple.
[00:56:04.961 --> 00:56:05.582]  It's not a stumble.
[00:56:05.622 --> 00:56:07.103]  People are just now looking for this stuff.
[00:56:08.064 --> 00:56:12.548]  InfoWars warrant of government using microphones to spawn Americans 11 years ago.
[00:56:12.568 --> 00:56:15.110]  Here's Paul Joseph Watson's article from last year.
[00:56:20.572 --> 00:56:27.174]  There's another one where Samsung came out four years ago and said, your smart TV is watching and listening to you and selling it to third parties.
[00:56:27.654 --> 00:56:33.076]  So they actually say, in the terms of service, so watch what you say.
[00:56:33.096 --> 00:56:35.397]  I'm gonna say that again.
[00:56:35.917 --> 00:56:40.419]  Just like an Alexa, just like a Google Assist, just like any of these things you bring into your house, these Trojan horses.
[00:56:41.769 --> 00:56:55.257]  They're listening to you, and now watching in many cases, they have cameras in live time, calling the police on you, you name it, and they're using all the data, and they tell you, watch what you say, but see, I'm the one that first told you about it, so I'm the bad guy.
[00:56:55.497 --> 00:56:58.398]  I'm not the guy that was right about all this, and next year's news today.
[00:56:58.699 --> 00:57:03.061]  No, no, I'm the evil Sandy Hook guy, who won't quit bullying kids when I never even did that to begin with.
[00:57:03.721 --> 00:57:07.163]  That's how they brand folks that are right, so people don't listen to them.
[00:57:07.183 --> 00:57:09.305]  And I know you know that, but the general public doesn't.
[00:57:10.535 --> 00:57:12.176]  Everybody needs to get Turbo Force.
[00:57:12.636 --> 00:57:17.297]  Everybody needs to get Honor Roll, highest quality fish oil for your kids, for their brains, their energy, everything.

[00:57:19.138 --> 00:57:19.878]  It's amazing.
[00:57:19.938 --> 00:57:20.579]  It's over the top.
[00:57:20.899 --> 00:57:21.739]  Incredibly important.
[00:57:22.339 --> 00:57:25.160]  I think fish oil is a better nootropic than, you know, a lot of nootropics out there.
[00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:29.542]  You take our fish oils, for adults and children, with
[00:57:30.572 --> 00:57:40.980]  Our nootropic brain force, or our total body nootropic, beyond energy drink, next level, clean, healthy, 10-hour burn, over-the-top, I don't even know what to call it.

[00:57:56.092 --> 00:57:58.793]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[00:57:59.133 --> 00:58:05.034]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.

[00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:58.956]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.

[00:59:02.559 --> 00:59:05.982]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[00:59:06.262 --> 00:59:10.526]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:59:10.967 --> 00:59:14.230]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:25.354]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[00:59:26.114 --> 00:59:34.657]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.

[00:59:50.665 --> 01:00:00.469]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:07.509 --> 01:00:18.656]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:19.457 --> 01:00:21.258]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.184 --> 01:00:30.607]  So, I'm going to give the number out next segment and start taking calls for first-time callers on any subject you want to raise, any topic, but I've got a few I want to throw out.
[01:00:31.107 --> 01:00:39.530]  I've got a bunch of clips, a bunch of huge news, the world accelerating in the global crisis, admitted total censorship, total surveillance, worse than I ever even said.
[01:00:40.885 --> 01:00:41.726]  Just out in the open.
[01:00:42.507 --> 01:00:43.868]  It is all coming up.
[01:00:43.888 --> 01:00:45.891]  The Super Bowl is talking about a cashless society.
[01:00:46.391 --> 01:00:48.694]  This is what big banks are saying they want within just two years.
[01:00:49.014 --> 01:00:50.175]  Robots replacing humans.
[01:00:50.616 --> 01:00:52.538]  They're building a world that makes us obsolete.
[01:00:52.598 --> 01:00:58.705]  But because I've not been plugging and talking about how to fund the show enough, I'm going to do it right now, here on air, before we go to break.
[01:01:01.963 --> 01:01:15.549]  I've been on air 24 years, and I set out to awaken America and the world because I believed that humanity weren't cowards, and humanity wasn't stupid.
[01:01:15.989 --> 01:01:30.775]  That if folks were shown the facts of what was being constructed by the globalists, by the technocrats, and that their endgame is an anti-God, anti-human, satanic world system, I believed
[01:01:31.783 --> 01:01:35.364]  The good men and women would stand up and rally against it.
[01:01:36.604 --> 01:01:40.945]  And I don't take all the credit for what's happened with Infowars.
[01:01:40.985 --> 01:01:43.266]  In fact, I take very little of the credit.
[01:01:43.906 --> 01:01:45.186]  Because that goes back to what I just said.
[01:01:46.326 --> 01:02:00.770]  I believe there was a focal point laying it out with the evidence, as only the internet coming into its own 24 years ago could allow, up until that point in history, that people would respond.
[01:02:01.721 --> 01:02:07.527]  And that the population would start researching themselves and that it would trigger a chain reaction.
[01:02:08.268 --> 01:02:13.233]  I never intended, though, to be a hyper-dominant leader at the forefront of this.
[01:02:14.414 --> 01:02:21.842]  I was always about having other guests and other individuals and groups on who were experts in their field to help inform the public even better than I could.
[01:02:23.476 --> 01:02:34.643]  But in the last 10 years, Infowars became the dominant leader, globally, in rebooting nationalism and renaissance against the globalist, post-industrial, neo-feudalist system.
[01:02:36.264 --> 01:02:47.791]  But the globalists ignored that, which was fine with me, until about three years ago, when they decided to use me against Trump and other nationalists by misrepresenting who I was and what I'd really said, and taking me out of context.
[01:02:48.792 --> 01:02:52.294]  That miscalculation actually spread anti-New World Order
[01:02:53.737 --> 01:03:00.622]  Information technology around the world faster, and was critical in putting Trump over the top.
[01:03:01.423 --> 01:03:06.346]  Just as Hillary thought, oh, he'll be the nominee, but I'll beat him easier, and that backfired.
[01:03:06.687 --> 01:03:12.091]  Then she thought, I'll say Alex Jones is the dark heart and this evil demon, and like Godzilla, he's so powerful.
[01:03:12.751 --> 01:03:14.893]  Then that blew up in her face, and it only made us more powerful.
[01:03:15.834 --> 01:03:35.641]  And then, they made the decision, because of all the chain reactions everywhere, where there were fan videos every day with 5, 10 million views apiece, and hundreds of millions of views a week on different platforms, not even of my own show, but of derivatives of what I was saying and doing, they hit the panic button and said, we were already looking at total censorship in the next few years.
[01:03:36.262 --> 01:03:40.863]  But let's accelerate the plan, start with him, and then drop the hammer on everybody else.
[01:03:41.964 --> 01:03:42.384]  And it's here.
[01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:44.332]  Total surveillance.
[01:03:44.472 --> 01:03:46.697]  They're listening, they're watching on your phone, on your TV.
[01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:48.280]  It's going into AI computers.
[01:03:49.081 --> 01:03:51.106]  The technocracy's on an incredible power trip.
[01:03:51.466 --> 01:03:54.132]  Horrible leftists trained in the universities to hate you and your family.
[01:03:55.069 --> 01:04:01.233]  Have been brought into these cults of big tech who are allowed to have access to everything you do.
[01:04:01.253 --> 01:04:08.777]  It's in the news today that you have a brain tumor, that you're pregnant, that you're depressed, that you have HIV, that you're gay.
[01:04:09.078 --> 01:04:14.261]  Whatever it is, they're there raping your privacy while calling themselves liberal.
[01:04:14.421 --> 01:04:14.981]  They're a fraud.
[01:04:16.762 --> 01:04:19.464]  So, there are a lot of people out there asking for support.
[01:04:20.708 --> 01:04:22.469]  And there are a lot of mainstream media outlets collapsing.
[01:04:22.509 --> 01:04:23.910]  We've stood the test of time.
[01:04:24.211 --> 01:04:25.972]  We would get bigger if we weren't censored, not smaller.
[01:04:26.993 --> 01:04:37.521]  But the things they've done to this, and the things they've pulled against InfoWars, if our audience doesn't realize how critical it is, and don't keep spreading the word, and don't keep sharing articles and videos,
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:41.783]  And don't keep buying the great products you already need anyways.
[01:04:42.424 --> 01:04:47.970]  Globalist will be successful in the next year or so, shutting down InfoWars.
[01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:49.872]  So, I'm shooting up the bat signal here.
[01:04:49.892 --> 01:04:59.762]  You've really supported us over the years, but the fight's now reaching the critical part of the battle, and I need your commitment to get great products you already need, but to steadfastly get them at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:05.461 --> 01:05:08.765]  Now you've stayed vigilant, you've been pushing the site, and you've been helping us get it out there.
[01:05:08.845 --> 01:05:12.390]  But if you don't keep pushing, this is an ongoing fight we're going to lose.
[01:05:12.610 --> 01:05:16.796]  So please, InfoWars.com forward slash show, get that link out to everybody.
[01:05:16.896 --> 01:05:20.841]  And please remember InfoWarsStore.com, where we have the very best fish oil.
[01:05:21.021 --> 01:05:22.221]  We're good to go.
[01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:54.821]  TurboForce is the ultimate vitamin mineral, total energy, fusion, next level, total mega package, nothing else is even there.
[01:05:55.001 --> 01:06:00.749]  Get TurboForce today at InfoWarsWives.com, but I recommend you only take half a dose the first time.
[01:06:00.849 --> 01:06:02.331]  Beware the power of TurboForce!
[01:06:20.097 --> 01:06:20.878]  InfoWars.
[01:06:21.218 --> 01:06:22.139]  Tomorrow's news.
[01:06:22.399 --> 01:06:22.820]  Today.
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:37.112]  You know, we play ominous music because the globalists are very, very ominous people.
[01:06:39.234 --> 01:06:46.321]  And I discovered yesterday, and I did a bunch of research last night, it made me physically sick to my stomach.
[01:06:48.595 --> 01:06:50.876]  Like a compulsion to just go out and stop these people.
[01:06:51.536 --> 01:06:57.339]  My body, angry at me that I physically wasn't going to confront these individuals.
[01:06:58.179 --> 01:06:59.120]  And that's Bill Maher.
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:05.403]  When I had Owen Benjamin on yesterday, the well-known comedian who's known Maher for over a decade.
[01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:14.887]  And I was like, it's crazy he made pedophilic jokes about the Catholic school young men and children from Covington.
[01:07:15.207 --> 01:07:16.528]  We have the lawyer in studio tomorrow.
[01:07:16.808 --> 01:07:17.328]  He's here today.
[01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:26.528]  And I said, it's incredibly pedophilic, and he also says he hates them and that they started a fight a week after everybody knew that it was a hoax.
[01:07:27.949 --> 01:07:33.652]  And owner Benjamin said, you don't know about him, I'm politically incorrect, saying that a 12-year-old having sex with an adult is love.
[01:07:34.532 --> 01:07:38.374]  A 35-year-old having sex with a little boy or little girl is love.
[01:07:38.434 --> 01:07:39.995]  That's the exact nambla quote.
[01:07:41.496 --> 01:07:42.136]  And I said, no.
[01:07:42.236 --> 01:07:43.236]  So the crew pulled it up.
[01:07:44.937 --> 01:07:45.978]  And then we found other clips.
[01:07:45.998 --> 01:07:47.879]  And then he goes, oh, Benjamin goes, you don't know?
[01:07:49.653 --> 01:07:51.554]  The name of his production company for 25 years?
[01:07:52.874 --> 01:07:53.775]  And I said, no, what is it?
[01:07:53.795 --> 01:07:55.015]  He said, it's Kid Love.
[01:07:57.596 --> 01:08:00.577]  Kid Love is one of the three handles used by Nambla.
[01:08:01.418 --> 01:08:02.478]  And I said, you're joking.
[01:08:02.618 --> 01:08:04.179]  Oh, and he said, no, I'm dead serious.
[01:08:04.599 --> 01:08:05.700]  We went to IMDB.
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:11.262]  We even went to his main website and he, it's the name is Kid Love.
[01:08:13.863 --> 01:08:16.544]  Kid Love Productions.
[01:08:18.585 --> 01:08:18.825]  Folks,
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:47.215]  When I was growing up, and I was hearing people that had been in the military as officers, and people that had been FBI and all these other places, not in pencil pushing and paper pushing areas, but real on the ground stuff, I always heard, and I always thought it was weird and not true, because I was a kid, nobody ever tried to sexually touch me, that the establishment was obsessed with raping and killing children.
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:54.925]  And there was a whole secret government worldwide that entry into the club meant you had to kill children, or at least rape them.
[01:08:56.446 --> 01:09:06.393]  And then as I got older, I'm sitting there having dinner with General Benton K. Parton, former head of Air Force Weapons Development, head of the HAARP program, guy that developed super-secret space-based weapons.
[01:09:06.453 --> 01:09:09.415]  I mean, it doesn't get more influential than him.
[01:09:09.695 --> 01:09:12.717]  The top engineer over huge clandestine programs.
[01:09:13.498 --> 01:09:17.661]  And I've interviewed Stubblebine, head of Black Ops and everybody else, and they've confirmed it all as well.
[01:09:20.077 --> 01:09:20.937]  Is Parton even alive?
[01:09:20.977 --> 01:09:26.359]  Last time I heard, he's got Alzheimer's, but he's a great old guy, and his double mind died a few years ago.
[01:09:27.219 --> 01:09:39.663]  But, you're having dinner with him, at Luby's in Waco, because we have a speech there, and he's like, I'll tell you the real problem is that he runs a bunch of goddamn devil worshipper pedophiles.
[01:09:42.756 --> 01:09:46.778]  This is like 20 years ago.
[01:09:46.798 --> 01:09:48.298]  I'm like, yes, yes, General, yes.
[01:09:49.099 --> 01:09:52.600]  And you still, though, kind of think, these are just old eccentric guys.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.840]  And I'm sorry I used the Lord's name in vain.
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:54.581]  I don't mean it in vain.
[01:09:54.601 --> 01:09:55.801]  I don't think he meant it in vain.
[01:09:55.841 --> 01:09:57.602]  They're GD devils that are going to go to hell.
[01:09:58.762 --> 01:09:59.583]  I'm not using it in vain.
[01:09:59.623 --> 01:10:00.143]  He wasn't either.
[01:10:00.163 --> 01:10:01.923]  But if it offends, I'm sorry.
[01:10:01.963 --> 01:10:03.264]  I'm giving you the accurate quote.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.142]  And it's just that all these years later, it's all true.
[01:10:10.043 --> 01:10:13.705]  And there is a tenfold increase in the arrest of pedophiles under Trump.
[01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:18.608]  Not just people that have child porn, but little kids and women and sex traffic.
[01:10:18.648 --> 01:10:24.671]  And you've got the UN caught trafficking thousands of kids out of one country alone and a bunch of them found dead.
[01:10:26.632 --> 01:10:27.373]  And now you've got
[01:10:28.598 --> 01:10:35.841]  Desmond is amazing, one of these quote, drag kids, who's been doing this since he's five years old, on TV with people that are axe murderers.
[01:10:38.622 --> 01:10:41.943]  Literally, the guy cuts somebody up with a big sharp object.
[01:10:43.404 --> 01:10:46.605]  And they're talking about taking ketamine, that is an orgy drug.
[01:10:46.625 --> 01:10:49.266]  And they're talking about taking Rufies, that is an orgy drug.
[01:10:49.866 --> 01:10:55.308]  And you got the little kid on TV with drag queens and with convicted murderers.
[01:10:55.848 --> 01:10:57.009]  We put those guys back on screen.
[01:10:58.174 --> 01:11:01.196]  And they've got artwork everywhere about how it's fun to drug kids up.
[01:11:02.237 --> 01:11:02.658]  Prohibinol.
[01:11:02.698 --> 01:11:05.139]  And it shows a little girl jump roping.
[01:11:06.641 --> 01:11:07.822]  You find out about who the artist is.
[01:11:08.082 --> 01:11:08.602]  It's all that.
[01:11:10.384 --> 01:11:14.927]  And it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[01:11:15.488 --> 01:11:16.829]  And it's just all out in the open.
[01:11:17.969 --> 01:11:18.670]  And it's being done.
[01:11:19.451 --> 01:11:23.614]  And Bill Maher's production company is called Kid Love.
[01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:32.834]  And that's one of the code words, publicly used, is that it's just love.
[01:11:32.994 --> 01:11:35.796]  It's, it's, it's, it's, I love kids.
[01:11:36.736 --> 01:11:38.137]  That's what they say, I love kids.
[01:11:38.818 --> 01:11:39.238]  It's love.
[01:11:40.279 --> 01:11:47.564]  And they want the law to be, down to age three, that's what Namel pushes, I'm here to date your son or daughter.
[01:11:47.584 --> 01:11:48.825]  And it's love.
[01:11:49.585 --> 01:11:50.306]  And so what does he say?
[01:11:50.326 --> 01:11:52.367]  Noemar says it's love if a 12 year old
[01:11:56.291 --> 01:11:57.692]  Wants to have sex with a 35-year-old.
[01:11:57.712 --> 01:11:58.832]  The parents have to step down.
[01:11:59.672 --> 01:12:00.473]  They have no rights.
[01:12:01.493 --> 01:12:06.475]  The person that drugs your kid, tricks your kid, whatever, they can come destroy their innocence now.
[01:12:06.515 --> 01:12:08.936]  So I have a lot of news to cover.
[01:12:08.956 --> 01:12:12.257]  I want to open the phones up, but that video is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:12:13.077 --> 01:12:13.737]  Shock video.
[01:12:14.538 --> 01:12:18.179]  Bill Maher endorses pedophilia with small children.
[01:12:20.487 --> 01:12:28.971]  And then you find out the production company's named that, and he's done it a whole bunch of times, and it's the litmus test to get into the club.
[01:12:30.372 --> 01:12:30.732]  And there it is.
[01:12:30.792 --> 01:12:32.913]  Bill Maher openly endorses pedophilia as love.
[01:12:34.494 --> 01:12:38.396]  And so all you at YouTube and all you at Facebook and Twitter, they're trying to censor us and block our videos.
[01:12:38.956 --> 01:12:41.197]  The people of America and the world, you're not stopping them.
[01:12:42.278 --> 01:12:44.919]  They're going to Infowars.com and Newswars.com right now.
[01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:54.527]  And they're posting it to their own websites, they're sharing it via their own email, they're text messaging it to people that has one of the highest open rates and saying, look at this monstrous video of this guy.
[01:12:54.767 --> 01:12:55.927]  We've got to protect our children.
[01:12:56.668 --> 01:12:58.289]  And then you add to that how they're coming after the children.
[01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:59.750]  This is what we've got to do.
[01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:14.158]  And I remember over and over and over again being brought up not to hate anybody, not to look down on anybody, and hearing everything that was coming, being told that
[01:13:15.299 --> 01:13:19.980]  You know, the whole homosexual agenda, all of this, is just to then get to sexualized kids.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:23.501]  And then I saw Jocelyn Elders later say, help children masturbate.
[01:13:23.761 --> 01:13:27.722]  Have the teachers, you know, grab your preschoolers' genitals and, you know, do all this.
[01:13:28.602 --> 01:13:31.582]  And so, it's just, you understand, they want their hands on your children.
[01:13:32.142 --> 01:13:33.603]  They want to put deadly vaccines in them.
[01:13:33.823 --> 01:13:35.303]  They want to give them deadly GMO.
[01:13:35.683 --> 01:13:36.903]  They want to sexualize them.
[01:13:36.923 --> 01:13:44.185]  If they can't abort them in the womb, and they can't brain damage them and give them a chemical lobotomy with a vaccine,
[01:13:45.216 --> 01:13:47.137]  Which the insert says it does to a percentage of people.
[01:13:47.678 --> 01:13:48.899]  Most folks just get an IQ reduction.
[01:13:49.579 --> 01:13:55.803]  Just like fluoride on average lowers IQ by about 15 points, you drink it at one part per million for more than a decade when you're a child.
[01:13:58.245 --> 01:14:00.206]  So, that's where all this is.
[01:14:01.728 --> 01:14:03.889]  And they're coming for everybody.
[01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:09.373]  And they're destroying the existing norms because they've got even more horrible things to come after that.
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:12.140]  Because it's always the same.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.381]  They want to euthanize the old people.
[01:14:14.141 --> 01:14:15.741]  They want to abort as many babies as they can.
[01:14:15.761 --> 01:14:20.383]  And the ones that make it, they want to feed on and destroy and slowly suck their souls.
[01:14:21.023 --> 01:14:21.883]  I want to talk about this.
[01:14:21.903 --> 01:14:30.106]  I want to talk about the whole frontrunner group of Democrats all saying free health care, free college, free everything.
[01:14:30.146 --> 01:14:32.007]  Just the free health care is the entire budget every year.
[01:14:32.747 --> 01:14:33.167]  So it's here.
[01:14:34.249 --> 01:14:35.130]  What's your take on that?
[01:14:35.850 --> 01:14:40.774]  And a whole bunch of other incredible footage that we're going to be getting to in a bunch of other special reports here today.
[01:14:40.794 --> 01:14:41.635]  But I want to open the phones up.
[01:14:41.655 --> 01:14:43.356]  I told you I'm going to start taking calls every day.
[01:14:43.376 --> 01:14:45.678]  I'm going to commit to that and I want the crew to push me to do it.
[01:14:46.798 --> 01:14:47.419]  So the number is 877-789-2539.
[01:14:47.439 --> 01:14:47.639]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:14:47.659 --> 01:14:52.222]  The three or four callers I didn't get to yesterday because we were out of time, you go to the front of the line.
[01:14:56.485 --> 01:14:57.966]  So it's first-time callers right now.
[01:14:58.086 --> 01:14:58.907]  Anything you want to talk about.
[01:14:59.527 --> 01:15:03.709]  But, technically, if you've never gotten on air before or sat on hold, you're welcome to call in as well.
[01:15:03.729 --> 01:15:06.091]  We really appreciate your time.
[01:15:06.111 --> 01:15:06.371]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:06.391 --> 01:15:14.856]  877-789-ALEX is the number to join us on this Tuesday live global transmission.
[01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:21.220]  Also, Iran's announcing offensive strategies, so that war is gearing up with Israel there.
[01:15:22.961 --> 01:15:24.142]  Spanish populist party.
[01:15:25.782 --> 01:15:30.090]  Leader slams conservatives who keep caving into political correctness, but this is a central point.
[01:15:31.051 --> 01:15:36.941]  And that ties into Italian politician says people smugglers may have deliberately drowned refugees as part of illicit stunts.
[01:15:37.663 --> 01:15:38.184]  Of course they do.
[01:15:39.172 --> 01:15:41.073]  Islamists blow up their kids in suicide bombings.
[01:15:41.893 --> 01:15:44.275]  Katie Hopkins, of course, has exposed that whole situation.
[01:15:44.335 --> 01:15:47.036]  Now they have to stage at least the dead bodies on the beach for the media.
[01:15:47.917 --> 01:15:52.479]  It's all coming up today on the other side of this global transmission.
[01:15:52.519 --> 01:15:55.541]  We have a special guest as well popping in in the third hour.
[01:15:55.861 --> 01:15:59.103]  And Paul Joseph Watson hosts the fourth hour from London.
[01:16:05.466 --> 01:16:08.088]  I have not come to grips with how I'm supposed to announce this.
[01:16:09.466 --> 01:16:21.471]  And then that's how I always say, this is coming up and I announce it right there, but I need to really think about this and look at it carefully before I make the announcement because I'm not quite sure what's happening or what we should do, but we're not going to be able to expand.
[01:16:22.591 --> 01:16:24.172]  And if we're not expanding, that means we're contracting.
[01:16:25.192 --> 01:16:27.593]  And then I look up and I say, I haven't cut new ads in weeks.
[01:16:28.013 --> 01:16:29.294]  I don't promote the products we've got.
[01:16:29.314 --> 01:16:30.494]  So it's my fault.
[01:16:30.514 --> 01:16:31.895]  But at the same time, I just want to cover news.
[01:16:33.587 --> 01:16:42.032]  I just need everybody listening to understand this is history happening, and if you don't go buy the products, and if you don't routinely buy them, sign up for AutoShip to get fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:16:42.112 --> 01:16:44.413]  It's concentrated, fortified with a little silver and iodine.
[01:16:44.493 --> 01:16:55.899]  And if you don't get our new TurboForce that's beyond any energy drink you've ever had, it's healthy with all the trace elements and minerals and vitamin C and the amino acids and the organic caffeine stimulants.
[01:16:55.959 --> 01:16:56.499]  It's incredible.
[01:16:56.559 --> 01:16:58.280]  TurboForce, 33% off out of the gate.
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:03.103]  If you don't go get the products, the best fish roll for adults, the best fish roll for kids, Honor Roll,
[01:17:03.183 --> 01:17:04.884]  If you don't get the very best, it's the best!
[01:17:04.984 --> 01:17:08.566]  I go up to top firms and say, I want to go above the top brand in the country.
[01:17:08.626 --> 01:17:11.007]  They go, what, 1% so you can say that?
[01:17:11.047 --> 01:17:11.307]  No!
[01:17:11.327 --> 01:17:11.647]  50% above them.
[01:17:11.708 --> 01:17:13.108]  Well, that won't fit in the capsule.
[01:17:13.228 --> 01:17:14.889]  Okay, we're 20% above the very best.
[01:17:15.109 --> 01:17:16.010]  And we're lower priced!
[01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:18.211]  That's our body's turmeric.
[01:17:18.351 --> 01:17:18.911]  Our fish oil.
[01:17:19.111 --> 01:17:19.612]  The best.
[01:17:19.772 --> 01:17:20.372]  The cleanest.
[01:17:20.472 --> 01:17:20.932]  The best.
[01:17:21.032 --> 01:17:21.553]  The cleanest.
[01:17:21.653 --> 01:17:25.415]  At a price lower than they sell Jeff Bezos at the damn Whole Foods.
[01:17:25.595 --> 01:17:31.518]  I'll tell you again, my job would be a lot easier if I didn't spend my time scrounging around for money.
[01:17:31.618 --> 01:17:34.221]  But you can sure as hell see that we're in the fight for our lives.
[01:17:34.261 --> 01:17:37.986]  So you've all been committed to us and you've bought a ton of great product that you love.
[01:17:38.166 --> 01:17:40.849]  Average 5.8 star on third-party review sites.
[01:17:41.010 --> 01:17:48.479]  But if I don't get up here and explain to people that it's do or die, people don't take action and don't get the product.
[01:17:48.519 --> 01:17:48.659]  So...
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:50.781]  Here's what it comes down to.
[01:17:51.141 --> 01:17:53.742]  I don't want to cancel some of the shows we already have.
[01:17:53.902 --> 01:17:57.004]  And I sure as hell don't want to start curtailing how many reporters we have.
[01:17:57.064 --> 01:17:58.605]  We need more reporters.
[01:17:58.625 --> 01:17:59.285]  20 more reporters.
[01:17:59.625 --> 01:18:00.766]  I've got big plans.
[01:18:00.846 --> 01:18:01.787]  The enemy knows it.
[01:18:01.907 --> 01:18:03.347]  But I need money.
[01:18:03.608 --> 01:18:04.468]  All my assets.
[01:18:04.708 --> 01:18:06.110]  Is it enough to run this place for three months?
[01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:08.432]  Again, I don't want the private jet airplane.
[01:18:08.873 --> 01:18:10.114]  I don't want the big mansions.
[01:18:10.495 --> 01:18:22.789]  I want to see the globalists in prison, and I want to see them not teaching five-year-olds how to put glasses on little boys, and I want to defeat this whole thing, but I need cold, hard cash from a barrelhead, and I need you to commit and say,
[01:18:23.169 --> 01:18:30.631]  I'm not giving money to the candy-ass church down the street that doesn't say anything about unborn babies and doesn't say anything about sexualization of children or rural government.
[01:18:30.751 --> 01:18:36.113]  I'm going to tithe every month to Infowarstore.com and I'm going to get products I need.
[01:18:36.333 --> 01:18:37.773]  I'm going to get things that are good.
[01:18:37.974 --> 01:18:38.914]  Buy books monthly.
[01:18:38.994 --> 01:18:40.054]  Buy videos monthly.
[01:18:40.194 --> 01:18:42.175]  After you're done watching them, donate them to the library.
[01:18:42.355 --> 01:18:43.115]  Hundreds will see it.
[01:18:43.195 --> 01:18:45.656]  Get the fish oil you need for your brain, your heart, your liver.
[01:18:45.736 --> 01:18:46.676]  Get it for your children.
[01:18:46.796 --> 01:18:52.738]  If you're in the military or law enforcement or want to work out hard or just want that turbo force energy, turbo force.
[01:18:52.898 --> 01:18:54.039]  There's nothing like it!
[01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:59.786]  It will be the number one next-level energy drink healthy alternative in the world if you just try it.
[01:19:00.047 --> 01:19:00.507]  It's simple.
[01:19:00.627 --> 01:19:02.169]  Other corporations don't do that.
[01:19:02.209 --> 01:19:08.276]  They go, we're gonna put it all in marketing, have a bunch of girls in swimsuits and NFL players say it's great, and then it's a bunch of crap.
[01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:09.698]  This is the best.
[01:19:09.838 --> 01:19:11.220]  This is TurboForce.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.780]  That's not in competition with brain force.
[01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:14.321]  It's a nootropic with a little bit of energy.
[01:19:14.421 --> 01:19:15.421]  Knocks people's socks off.
[01:19:15.441 --> 01:19:16.841]  Because you never have the nootropic with the energy.
[01:19:16.941 --> 01:19:19.362]  This is everything with the nootropic and the energy.
[01:19:19.502 --> 01:19:22.202]  And quite frankly, most people should take a quarter to a half packet of it.
[01:19:22.242 --> 01:19:26.103]  Because I wanted to have the biggest, meanest, baddest thing out there that's healthy and clean.
[01:19:26.243 --> 01:19:28.544]  And it's just too damn Tyrannosaurus Rex.
[01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:31.684]  I mean, it is just fire-breathing amazing.
[01:19:31.784 --> 01:19:34.765]  So we did it again, thanks to the good Lord and the commitment to do it.
[01:19:34.905 --> 01:19:36.285]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:19:39.266 --> 01:19:43.374]  And it's a contest between our wills, Soros' will, and your will!
[01:19:43.955 --> 01:19:51.249]  InfoWars is only a focal point, but if you focus on what we're doing and pray for us, we pray for you, we're together and we're unstoppable!
[01:20:06.447 --> 01:20:10.590]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:30.342]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:20:30.822 --> 01:20:34.745]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:20:49.626 --> 01:20:58.092]  To this world we're thrown.
[01:20:59.313 --> 01:21:05.297]  Alright, I'm going to go to your phone calls starting at the next segment.
[01:21:06.138 --> 01:21:14.404]  There's so much news here that sometimes it's hard to even get to the news because you don't know what to cover first.
[01:21:17.648 --> 01:21:18.908]  I see these studies every day.
[01:21:20.009 --> 01:21:21.189]  It's been well known forever.
[01:21:22.610 --> 01:21:31.593]  The modern systems were designed to mesmerize children and then to basically give them low attention spans and low IQs.
[01:21:33.093 --> 01:21:38.815]  Study increased screen time in young children associated with developmental delays.
[01:21:41.036 --> 01:21:41.696]  That's from Fox.
[01:21:43.177 --> 01:21:46.438]  I love how they tell you all this, once everybody's totally addicted.
[01:21:46.458 --> 01:21:55.201]  You know, I said a decade ago, there's going to be huge screen time rehab clinics in the future.
[01:21:56.962 --> 01:21:59.162]  And now, that's the new big hot trend.
[01:21:59.202 --> 01:22:00.623]  Again, next decade's news today.
[01:22:01.223 --> 01:22:02.924]  But it's not because, again, I'm that smart.
[01:22:03.104 --> 01:22:05.264]  I actually go off what the globalists say and do.
[01:22:05.925 --> 01:22:12.227]  And that's my big frustration, is that they put out all these fake political ideologies and all these systems and all these control arms.
[01:22:12.995 --> 01:22:28.626]  But at the end of the day, they're devil worshippers that think they're God, who use communism and socialism to domesticate people and control your paradigm so that you never want anything better for yourself, so that you're under their control for chicken feed.
[01:22:29.987 --> 01:22:31.128]  That's what domestication means.
[01:22:32.248 --> 01:22:35.671]  Like cows in a pen, or horses, or pigs that you're going to slaughter.
[01:22:36.611 --> 01:22:38.853]  They control you, they run you, they own you.
[01:22:40.919 --> 01:22:44.702]  And the Renaissance and Americana was about getting away from that feudal system.
[01:22:45.122 --> 01:22:46.503]  You know, that sounds like a horrible system.
[01:22:46.903 --> 01:22:50.065]  That's how every other country and system ran previous to ours.
[01:22:51.386 --> 01:22:53.207]  Previous to the Renaissance, 500 years ago.
[01:22:56.269 --> 01:23:04.155]  And so they're just simply bringing back what gives them total control, because it's what these inbred elites, and inbreeding creates psychotic behavior, want.
[01:23:05.295 --> 01:23:07.377]  I mean, you could talk about Ted Bundy all day long.
[01:23:09.773 --> 01:23:15.256]  And I want you guys to remind me to cover him at the start of the next hour, because it'll take some time to get into it.
[01:23:16.697 --> 01:23:27.783]  Because I know the inside baseball about Netflix, and the inside baseball about how they operate and what they do, but they have a new show out, worshipping the serial killer Ted Bundy.
[01:23:30.044 --> 01:23:35.207]  And then, when people point that out, they go, oh, yes, we're being politically correct.
[01:23:35.307 --> 01:23:36.488]  Don't lionize him.
[01:23:36.868 --> 01:23:38.109]  Don't say he's sexy.
[01:23:38.968 --> 01:23:40.449]  But that's all formulaically done.
[01:23:43.411 --> 01:23:47.954]  That's Netflix's advertising formulae.
[01:23:51.276 --> 01:23:58.421]  That's why in these Sandy Hook lawsuits against me, they keep saying, show us the marketing documents where you just said Sandy Hook didn't happen to make money.
[01:23:59.021 --> 01:24:05.606]  As if we cover news, certain news, because it's a marketing angle.
[01:24:05.666 --> 01:24:07.647]  We cover stuff because I think it's important.
[01:24:09.639 --> 01:24:16.380]  And I was censored and blocked and persecuted all these years for saying things that were unpopular at the time that turned out to be true.
[01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:18.041]  That 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:24:18.541 --> 01:24:21.161]  That radical elements of our government worked with radical Islam in Saudi Arabia.
[01:24:21.381 --> 01:24:22.122]  That's all admitted now.
[01:24:22.842 --> 01:24:23.582]  Stand down all of it.
[01:24:24.542 --> 01:24:29.343]  That we're being surveilled with a panopticonic control grid tracking everything we do to control us and track us.
[01:24:29.363 --> 01:24:30.443]  That massive censorship's coming.
[01:24:30.623 --> 01:24:31.223]  It's all admitted.
[01:24:32.344 --> 01:24:36.344]  That fluoride and 3G and 4G and 5G and all this fries your DNA.
[01:24:36.584 --> 01:24:37.425]  That's all admitted now.
[01:24:38.025 --> 01:24:39.185]  I'm just not out to get people.
[01:24:40.666 --> 01:24:42.167]  Most folks figure out this is going on.
[01:24:42.427 --> 01:24:44.628]  The globalists come to them and say, hey, you figured it all out.
[01:24:44.688 --> 01:24:45.328]  You should be with us.
[01:24:46.909 --> 01:24:47.969]  I'm not joining them, ever.
[01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:52.491]  But I tell you this, the general public's basically joining them.
[01:24:52.551 --> 01:24:53.992]  More and more people just don't care.
[01:24:57.434 --> 01:25:09.379]  Let's play the audio with the video of folks doing a demonstration of how, phone by phone, tracker by tracker, Trojan horse beside Trojan horse, you can call one Apple iPhone on FaceTime,
[01:25:11.297 --> 01:25:20.539]  And then you hit a couple buttons, and then even though the person doesn't pick up, it picks up, and you hear everything they say, and everything they do.
[01:25:20.559 --> 01:25:27.860]  Folks, that's a backdoor to where anybody that works at Apple, or anybody that knows how this works, the FBI, you name it, can do it.
[01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:30.240]  And I've told everybody this over and over again, but look.
[01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:34.301]  Hot mic!
[01:25:35.501 --> 01:25:40.062]  Whatis.com, and it gets into what these phones and devices are actually called by the FBI.
[01:25:41.155 --> 01:25:41.575]  There's another one.
[01:25:41.695 --> 01:25:46.557]  FBI tap cell phone mic as eavesdropping tool without warrants.
[01:25:48.317 --> 01:25:46.557]  2006.
[01:25:48.658 --> 01:25:51.759]  In 1999, I exposed that OnStar was listening to people and it later turned out was true.
[01:25:51.779 --> 01:25:54.019]  I was told by insiders.
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:56.060]  Oh, but don't worry.
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:05.783]  The only way you can not have this done to you is go into the phone settings itself and turn FaceTime completely off every time you use it.
[01:26:05.823 --> 01:26:10.425]  And by the way, that's just so the general public can't every time call you
[01:26:11.792 --> 01:26:15.194]  And hit two buttons, and then listen to everything going on in your house.
[01:26:15.875 --> 01:26:20.978]  By the way, everybody better do this now, because they just publicized how everyone can do this.
[01:26:21.539 --> 01:26:27.883]  I remember having John Ronson, a TV producer from England, in my house 20 years ago.
[01:26:31.161 --> 01:26:34.106]  And he said, why do you have tape covering your webcam?
[01:26:34.707 --> 01:26:38.133]  And I said, because the governments and others routinely dial into those and get data.
[01:26:38.153 --> 01:26:38.914]  And he laughed at me.
[01:26:39.715 --> 01:26:45.404]  Oh, but decades later, Comey's so smart covering up his, and of course, Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:26:46.570 --> 01:26:47.111]  Oh, but here it is.
[01:26:47.191 --> 01:26:48.192]  CNN will now tell us.
[01:26:48.232 --> 01:26:49.033]  Thank you, CNN.
[01:26:49.613 --> 01:26:52.617]  How to turn off FaceTime and avoid Apple's eavesdropping bug.
[01:26:52.957 --> 01:27:02.427]  A newly discovered privacy bug in Apple's FaceTime software allows users to hide and see the person they're calling without the recipient even picking up.
[01:27:03.008 --> 01:27:03.668]  The glitch.
[01:27:03.748 --> 01:27:04.830]  Yes, it's a glitch.
[01:27:05.811 --> 01:27:16.216]  Impacts iPhones and iPads running iOS 12.1 and Apple's PC running Mac OS Mojave and newly added group FaceTime feature.
[01:27:17.136 --> 01:27:25.840]  Apple AAPL confirmed it started disabling the group's FaceTime features for all users, but the issue may still impact one-on-one FaceTime calls.
[01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:27.841]  Those back doors are big.
[01:27:28.301 --> 01:27:33.984]  Until the company rolls out a fix later this week, here's how to disable FaceTime on your Apple device.
[01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:37.829]  Open the settings on your iPhone or iPad.
[01:27:38.610 --> 01:27:39.630]  It's not yours, it's Apple's.
[01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:41.470]  Scroll down, select FaceTime.
[01:27:41.951 --> 01:27:46.632]  Toggle off the green button at the top of the screen to turn off a Mac.
[01:27:46.732 --> 01:27:47.372]  Follow these steps.
[01:27:49.472 --> 01:27:50.573]  Open the FaceTime app.
[01:27:50.873 --> 01:27:52.373]  Go to the FaceTime at the top of the screen.
[01:27:52.753 --> 01:27:53.974]  Select to turn off FaceTime.
[01:27:54.434 --> 01:27:55.114]  And then it goes on.
[01:27:55.934 --> 01:27:57.855]  So see, don't trust Alex Jones!
[01:27:58.135 --> 01:27:58.475]  Oh no!
[01:27:59.446 --> 01:28:03.027]  He says that your computers and your phones are watching and listening to you.
[01:28:03.047 --> 01:28:24.854]  I just have all the patents and all the documents going back to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 where they made it law by 2000 that all devices that have software to communicate via audio or video by law are considered these smart devices and have this embedded in them.
[01:28:25.254 --> 01:28:26.634]  It's the law.
[01:28:27.815 --> 01:28:28.955]  It's the law.
[01:28:30.225 --> 01:28:34.374]  And that's why they don't want us here telling you what's coming next.
[01:28:35.302 --> 01:28:36.603]  We're going to come back and take your calls.
[01:28:37.163 --> 01:28:42.265]  But the last segment of the show, Make Me Do It, because I always forget, I'm going to give you a few glimpses into what's coming next.
[01:28:43.165 --> 01:28:45.226]  Half the kids on your street are going to be dying of cancer.
[01:28:45.866 --> 01:28:46.947]  You're going to be dying of cancer.
[01:28:47.347 --> 01:28:48.948]  There's going to be hysteria, burning cities.
[01:28:49.368 --> 01:28:51.989]  People are going to be taking all sorts of new drugs to get over all the pain.
[01:28:53.610 --> 01:28:57.691]  Suddenly, they're going to turn the 5G on, and you're going to start having mass suicide everywhere.
[01:28:57.751 --> 01:28:58.132]  Get ready.
[01:28:58.172 --> 01:28:58.572]  It's coming.
[01:28:59.212 --> 01:29:00.853]  They're going to get ready to kill you and your family.
[01:29:00.893 --> 01:29:01.253]  Get ready.
[01:29:10.723 --> 01:29:14.706]  Robert Barnes is, again, one of the top lawyers in the country when it comes to this.
[01:29:15.206 --> 01:29:19.349]  He's represented major Hollywood stars in cases where they spent millions defending themselves.
[01:29:19.429 --> 01:29:20.910]  Some cases winning, some cases losing.
[01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:22.651]  Everybody knows about the Wesley Snipes case.
[01:29:22.671 --> 01:29:26.134]  But the point is, he's taking this pro bono because he says it's show, clear, cut.
[01:29:26.314 --> 01:29:27.795]  Show, who are you zeroing in on?
[01:29:27.935 --> 01:29:29.476]  Or I guess that's kind of inside baseball.
[01:29:29.696 --> 01:29:38.344]  So Reza, who was the former CNN producer, got fired last year for inflammatory comments, but has a huge social media following and is constantly in the press.
[01:29:38.645 --> 01:29:40.226]  He called for these kids to be punched.
[01:29:40.606 --> 01:29:45.151]  He referred to the face of young Nick as, uh, what a punchable face.
[01:29:45.491 --> 01:29:47.573]  He has refused to retract any of his false libels.
[01:29:47.833 --> 01:29:50.556]  He's almost a guarantee to be sued next Monday.
[01:29:51.216 --> 01:29:56.682]  Following on that is going to be Maggie Haberman, if she doesn't retract her false statements calling for the kids to be expelled.
[01:29:57.442 --> 01:30:04.930]  After that, Michael Rapoport, who's on a TV show on Netflix against bullying kids.
[01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:08.633]  And here he is bullying kids with homophobic rhetoric.
[01:30:08.953 --> 01:30:12.457]  He's going to get sued next week unless he takes corrective action.
[01:30:12.817 --> 01:30:25.868]  And then there's a range of other journalists, celebrities, and social media personalities that we've specifically called out and said they need to retract, they need to correct, they need to delete their offending tweet, or their offending comments, or retract their offending story.
[01:30:26.128 --> 01:30:31.813]  And if they do, they do within 48 hours, if they do by week's end, if they do by Friday midnight, they won't be sued.
[01:30:32.173 --> 01:30:33.955]  Anyone who refuses to or doubles down,
[01:30:34.395 --> 01:30:38.717]  Chances are they will be sued, and chances are they'll be seeing a Kentucky jury within the year.
[01:30:38.777 --> 01:30:40.877]  They said that they stopped the Indian march.
[01:30:41.018 --> 01:30:41.578]  Didn't happen.
[01:30:41.818 --> 01:30:44.679]  Said they surrounded the Native American elder.
[01:30:44.879 --> 01:30:45.439]  Didn't happen.
[01:30:45.739 --> 01:30:48.020]  They said that they went up into his face.
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:48.880]  Didn't happen.
[01:30:49.161 --> 01:30:50.661]  They said they chanted build the wall.
[01:30:50.841 --> 01:30:51.441]  Didn't happen.
[01:30:51.701 --> 01:30:53.122]  Said they chanted racist slurs.
[01:30:53.382 --> 01:30:53.982]  Didn't happen.
[01:30:54.302 --> 01:30:58.884]  Said that they were mocking him, taunting him, using racist references.
[01:30:59.264 --> 01:30:59.804]  Didn't happen.
[01:30:59.965 --> 01:31:00.545]  Didn't happen.
[01:31:00.665 --> 01:31:01.165]  Didn't happen.
[01:31:01.485 --> 01:31:05.169]  They were the victim of a lot of those things, but they themselves didn't do any of that.
[01:31:05.469 --> 01:31:06.290]  It's part of a campaign.
[01:31:06.610 --> 01:31:09.193]  The campaign is to have people have thought control.
[01:31:09.594 --> 01:31:16.100]  The current cultural left and the media left and the corporate media left thinks very much like sort of the priests during the Inquisition era.
[01:31:16.461 --> 01:31:20.425]  So they're not concerned with independence of thought, with the irrationality of thought.
[01:31:20.905 --> 01:31:21.805]  We're good to go.
[01:31:37.731 --> 01:31:43.275]  has been independent voices who give voice to independent people who can reach large numbers of people like yourself.
[01:31:43.635 --> 01:31:55.824]  That's why there's been this collusion between the big tech social media giants and the big media press into suppressing and oppressing your voice because they need to make sure that ordinary people like these Covington kids don't have a defense.
[01:31:56.244 --> 01:32:06.492]  That they don't have lawyers like me defending them in court because I don't even know the case exists, because I don't even know the circumstances happened, because I don't have access to people like yourself who tell me what actually happened and what's true.
[01:32:06.932 --> 01:32:20.363]  And that's what is part of a broader goal and a broader objective to suppress speech, censor thought, control minds, control behavior, so that you only think what the cultural elites and the corporate media want you to think, rather than being independent and having access to the truth.
[01:32:20.443 --> 01:32:24.686]  I mean, it's like what Thomas Jefferson said way back, the best answer to a bad idea is a good idea in a debate.
[01:32:24.766 --> 01:32:29.730]  If you truly believe the truth and empirical value and moral virtue of your ideas, you're never afraid of a debate.
[01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:33.254]  And it's all because of what the institutional press and the establishment press is doing.
[01:32:33.574 --> 01:32:40.102]  Where here they grit, greenlit bully behavior and violent behavior against a bunch of innocent, quiet kids from a small town in Kentucky.
[01:33:05.876 --> 01:33:11.998]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:29.503]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:33.493 --> 01:33:42.321]  So you see articles every day saying screen time makes kids have low IQs, lowers their development, makes them stupid, makes them depressed, linked to suicide, linked to obesity.
[01:33:43.903 --> 01:33:45.845]  Why didn't they tell us that when they were rolling it all out?
[01:33:47.066 --> 01:33:52.251]  Well, I've read the literature, but I was also invited almost 20 years ago into the UT psychology department.
[01:33:53.251 --> 01:33:57.534]  Where they were testing what became the iPads and iPhones and the rest of it for DARPA.
[01:33:58.215 --> 01:34:08.362]  And the whole thing was designed with monkeys they had hooked up, with wires in their brain, they were later euthanized, to test flicker rates on how to mesmerize someone.
[01:34:08.382 --> 01:34:13.266]  Have you ever noticed how a child, especially, will walk by a screen now and just look like a zombie?
[01:34:13.646 --> 01:34:15.367]  It's because it's an exact wavelength.
[01:34:15.387 --> 01:34:16.588]  So let me tell you what's coming next.
[01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:22.032]  Every metric, cancer, neurological disorders,
[01:34:23.061 --> 01:34:27.765]  Every metric is we are seeing exponential levels of death and disease.
[01:34:29.306 --> 01:34:30.767]  This is how you bring down a country.
[01:34:30.827 --> 01:34:31.928]  It's how you bring down the West.
[01:34:32.609 --> 01:34:41.096]  That's where these technologies are being used in a 21st century covert, soft kill war by the eugenics-based deep state who's allied with China.
[01:34:42.437 --> 01:34:45.259]  Now China just goes in and kills babies before they're born or after they're born.
[01:34:45.299 --> 01:34:45.960]  That's their agreement.
[01:34:48.064 --> 01:34:50.525]  It is being done as a population reduction program.
[01:34:51.105 --> 01:34:59.468]  And just like you turn up the frog, at one level the frog thinks it's in a hot tub, at level 6 or 7 the frog passes out, at level 10 the frog dies.
[01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:08.331]  And that's what they're doing is they're ambient turning up the 5G.
[01:35:08.391 --> 01:35:17.094]  They're ambiently turning up the flicker rate on the iPads until everyone is in a trance state and unable to even recognize
[01:35:18.370 --> 01:35:31.473]  What's happening to them, and then they have movies like Bird Box and The Kingsman, where they tell you there's an evil world government, and it's going to use wavelengths on cell phones to make everybody kill each other to depopulate the planet for the greater good.
[01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:33.613]  That's really the plan.
[01:35:34.474 --> 01:35:44.876]  And they're testing these systems to increase irritability, to increase depression, and can literally make you, if you're susceptible to this and fall into it, commit suicide.
[01:35:46.519 --> 01:35:51.804]  It's estimated that thousands of people a year die from just sitting at their computers playing video games too long.
[01:35:53.846 --> 01:35:56.849]  So the scientists always say, oh, excessive is linked to suicide.
[01:35:56.929 --> 01:35:57.089]  No.
[01:35:57.730 --> 01:36:00.052]  It's all been designed like this.
[01:36:01.053 --> 01:36:06.618]  So I would recommend most people not let your children really watch any television at this point on any of these high-tech screens.
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:09.541]  It's bad enough for the older ones.
[01:36:09.861 --> 01:36:11.202]  And I would suggest that as adults,
[01:36:12.256 --> 01:36:22.404]  You listen to talk radio, and that you turn away from it, and don't stare at it too long, because everyone knows that it causes all sorts of issues with your brain.
[01:36:23.324 --> 01:36:23.965]  And it's a fact!
[01:36:24.585 --> 01:36:29.229]  What I'm telling you is an absolute fact, just like all the illegal surveillance that's going on.
[01:36:31.110 --> 01:36:32.911]  And so, if you look at 1 in 37,000 with autism, 1 in 58,
[01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:42.334]  You look at, used to, cancer didn't even exist in children and now it's up 10,000 plus percent depending on the type.
[01:36:43.514 --> 01:36:45.116]  Breast cancer is up thousands of percent.
[01:36:45.896 --> 01:36:47.337]  We're being murdered.
[01:36:49.458 --> 01:36:54.142]  And the system says, oh don't worry about all the stuff doing that, let's just tax carbon dioxide.
[01:36:54.975 --> 01:36:58.536]  Plants breathe, and it puts out oxygen from the plant that cleans the earth.
[01:36:58.556 --> 01:37:08.720]  Let's get rid of the scrubbing gases, let's restrict those, and then have aluminum dioxide blast into the atmosphere, and electromagnetic antenna arrays fry the atmosphere.
[01:37:11.401 --> 01:37:12.261]  And that's all admitted.
[01:37:13.362 --> 01:37:20.324]  It's mainstream counsel on foreign relations everywhere that they're manipulating the weather on a mass scale.
[01:37:20.364 --> 01:37:21.725]  But see, they have a trendy come out.
[01:37:22.895 --> 01:37:26.258]  The first was the conspiracy guy for a few years and tell you, none of it exists.
[01:37:26.558 --> 01:37:31.543]  You're flat earthers if you think there's any geomodification going on or any manipulation of the weather.
[01:37:33.245 --> 01:37:35.887]  That's how they operate, yeah.
[01:37:36.208 --> 01:37:46.077]  And when people see those big, what looks like flying saucers in the air and the big swirls and what looks like a tornado being formed, that's what one antenna array can do.
[01:37:46.557 --> 01:37:47.818]  By the way, in Saudi Arabia,
[01:37:48.812 --> 01:37:53.213]  In China, in Russia, in Dubai, it's all over television.
[01:37:53.593 --> 01:38:01.135]  They just show them in one hour, take a blue sky in the desert, and form clouds, and then make it rain.
[01:38:01.195 --> 01:38:03.336]  We can pull it up on YouTube, showing them do it.
[01:38:03.996 --> 01:38:08.697]  But when we say, hey, it's going on here, Joe Rogan says, no, it's not.
[01:38:08.717 --> 01:38:11.057]  I am the commander of all reality.
[01:38:11.558 --> 01:38:15.058]  Anyone that says that it's not happening is insane.
[01:38:15.318 --> 01:38:17.339]  But old-fashioned cloud seeding is nothing.
[01:38:19.031 --> 01:38:25.815]  Again, you can just type into a regular search engine, antenna arrays used to make the desert green.
[01:38:27.476 --> 01:38:28.516]  Or Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:38:28.897 --> 01:38:33.119]  Council on Foreign Relations calls for geoengineering planet to stop global warming.
[01:38:33.499 --> 01:38:36.141]  And you read the 30-something page report, they admit it's already going on.
[01:38:36.181 --> 01:38:39.122]  And guess who has the government contract with the Department of Energy to carry it out?
[01:38:39.603 --> 01:38:42.144]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:38:42.905 --> 01:38:43.345]  Don't believe me?
[01:38:43.365 --> 01:38:43.825]  Just type in.
[01:38:44.145 --> 01:38:46.947]  Bill Gates studies how to control hurricanes.
[01:38:50.319 --> 01:38:53.721]  There it is, Developing an International Framework for Geoengineering, CFR.
[01:38:54.381 --> 01:38:56.022]  That's just one of hundreds of reports.
[01:38:56.543 --> 01:39:00.265]  There's an international treaty from 1978 about weather weapons.
[01:39:00.605 --> 01:39:12.592]  We have the former Defense Secretary, Michael Cohen, saying we have earthquake weapons, we have tectonic weapons, we have weather weapons, and other people have weather weapons.
[01:39:13.453 --> 01:39:13.753]  But see?
[01:39:15.658 --> 01:39:18.781]  I'm the bad guy, you see, because I told you first about it.
[01:39:19.401 --> 01:39:21.102]  And we had the meteorologist on about it.
[01:39:23.864 --> 01:39:24.445]  It's incredible.
[01:39:25.486 --> 01:39:27.888]  Yeah, their Secretary of Defense speaks out about earthquake weapons.
[01:39:30.129 --> 01:39:30.970]  Just don't believe me?
[01:39:31.010 --> 01:39:31.710]  Just type it in.
[01:39:32.871 --> 01:39:33.532]  Just type it in.
[01:39:33.572 --> 01:39:36.074]  You can actually go watch the video of the Defense Department of him pulling it down.
[01:39:38.021 --> 01:39:40.045]  So, it's our duty to get this out.
[01:39:40.085 --> 01:39:41.147]  I'll go to your calls next segment.
[01:39:41.167 --> 01:39:42.790]  We're going to push our guests back to 15 after.
[01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:43.691]  If you can't make it, it's fine.
[01:39:44.413 --> 01:39:46.596]  Because everyone will take calls, and I'm dedicated to taking calls.
[01:39:48.083 --> 01:39:58.329]  But the issue here is we're under globalist attack and they want us off the air because they want to carry this plan out when even most government people are compartmentalized and don't know what's going on.
[01:39:58.369 --> 01:40:05.333]  That's why the government's in rebellion against Trump and trying to block him from access to any of these agencies is because this stuff's all compartmentalized under special directors.
[01:40:05.753 --> 01:40:15.199]  Like Rosenstein's sister runs the vaccine damage program and the PR program with taxpayer money, billions a year, to pay for lies in the news saying vaccines only help, they don't hurt.
[01:40:15.859 --> 01:40:20.582]  She's over lying and saying it's safe, and she's over covering it up when your child dies or gets brain damaged.
[01:40:20.602 --> 01:40:22.723]  We covered that yesterday.
[01:40:23.243 --> 01:40:24.864]  It's all these key people.
[01:40:25.585 --> 01:40:27.486]  A few thousand per country running the whole show.
[01:40:28.086 --> 01:40:30.147]  I had Rothkopf on, head of the Kissinger Group, years ago.
[01:40:30.167 --> 01:40:30.788]  He tried to hire me.
[01:40:31.528 --> 01:40:33.329]  And he said, look, you're part of the superclass, Alex.
[01:40:33.349 --> 01:40:34.250]  You're a major leader.
[01:40:34.490 --> 01:40:35.991]  They always say that to people to make them feel big.
[01:40:36.371 --> 01:40:37.051]  Join us.
[01:40:37.192 --> 01:40:37.812]  Join me.
[01:40:38.272 --> 01:40:39.453]  And I will complete your training.
[01:40:42.489 --> 01:40:43.129]  It's ridiculous.
[01:40:43.349 --> 01:40:48.792]  It's these people all want to be part of the establishment, and they sell out cheap, and they're all jokes.
[01:40:49.852 --> 01:40:50.953]  I will not sell out to death.
[01:40:53.133 --> 01:40:55.634]  I will not sell out and molest children to be part of the club.
[01:40:55.755 --> 01:40:56.435]  I will not do it.
[01:40:57.395 --> 01:40:58.076]  You're disgusting!
[01:41:02.577 --> 01:41:04.378]  In fact, oh, it's just unbelievable.
[01:41:04.598 --> 01:41:05.258]  We're gonna go to break.
[01:41:05.519 --> 01:41:06.199]  Um, listen.
[01:41:07.657 --> 01:41:08.918]  I'm just going to tell Lister something right now.
[01:41:09.058 --> 01:41:24.331]  I think our best products, our body's ultimate turmeric formula, with a 95% curcuminoid level, that no other company got, nobody else did, because everybody else, even so-called high-quality groups, they put in a little bit of product, and then they do a bunch of advertising and promote it.
[01:41:24.571 --> 01:41:30.796]  Well, if you think turmeric has helped you before, most turmeric's about 5% on the market.
[01:41:31.637 --> 01:41:33.759]  Really good stuff, high-end stuff's half turmeric.
[01:41:35.674 --> 01:41:43.382]  The turmeric in this is 95% curcuminoid, and then it's got a bunch of other known plants in it that help boost it and accelerate it.
[01:41:44.724 --> 01:41:46.385]  So, you need to understand bodies.
[01:41:47.868 --> 01:41:50.551]  Nobody else has that bright yellow school bus color.
[01:41:51.252 --> 01:41:52.133]  That's what you're looking for.
[01:41:52.213 --> 01:41:52.713]  It's got it.
[01:41:53.074 --> 01:41:53.594]  It's amazing.
[01:41:53.614 --> 01:41:57.898]  For all the things Tumeric does, find out about bodies today at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:41:58.419 --> 01:42:00.661]  It is still half off.
[01:42:00.721 --> 01:42:03.284]  We didn't end that special because we got another big supply of it.
[01:42:03.324 --> 01:42:04.185]  I should have been adding that.
[01:42:04.465 --> 01:42:05.206]  That's 50% off.
[01:42:05.226 --> 01:42:05.206]  $29.95.
[01:42:06.107 --> 01:42:07.869]  Leading competitors aren't as good.
[01:42:07.889 --> 01:42:08.850]  They're like twice that price.
[01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:10.471]  We have the best fish oil.
[01:42:11.332 --> 01:42:15.914]  Out there we have Honor Roll for kids, that's concentrated, little bitty caplets, gel caplets.
[01:42:16.634 --> 01:42:21.396]  We also have for adults, the ultimate krill oil that is so pure, so good.
[01:42:21.416 --> 01:42:23.397]  And we have the ultimate fish oil as well.
[01:42:23.517 --> 01:42:24.137]  All three of those.
[01:42:24.657 --> 01:42:29.339]  Everybody, for energy, for healthy life, for brain, for heart, these are the best.
[01:42:29.839 --> 01:42:30.919]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:42:31.199 --> 01:42:34.941]  And then don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, we have our newest Turbo Force.
[01:42:35.782 --> 01:42:46.229]  For folks in the military, or doctors, or long-haul truck drivers, or airline pilots, or whatever, this is the cleanest-burning, wide-spectrum, nootropic energy, beyond-energy drink.
[01:42:46.649 --> 01:42:48.890]  Super-strong, super-healthy, super-amazing.
[01:42:49.211 --> 01:42:50.912]  This is what everybody else wishes they did.
[01:42:50.992 --> 01:42:53.353]  Nobody puts this much product in it of the highest quality.
[01:42:53.373 --> 01:42:55.855]  TurboForce, 33% off, out of the gates.
[01:42:55.975 --> 01:42:57.676]  I believe it's become our number one best-selling product.
[01:42:57.876 --> 01:42:59.197]  You need to try TurboForce today.
[01:43:02.873 --> 01:43:11.875]  Imagine if Infowars hadn't been here to expose the local government, to expose their plan to implode national sovereignty and nation's borders.
[01:43:12.995 --> 01:43:20.716]  Imagine if the lights had been turned off all those years, and the incredibly important topics we talk about hadn't been discussed.
[01:43:22.297 --> 01:43:25.917]  But it's because of you doing that over the years that we're here.
[01:43:26.657 --> 01:43:29.258]  And that's not some platitude, that's not some pat on the back.
[01:43:30.512 --> 01:43:36.396]  That is the humble recognition that you are the sea on which all of us sail.
[01:43:38.097 --> 01:43:38.657]  I'm the sea.
[01:43:38.797 --> 01:43:39.398]  You're the sea.
[01:43:39.418 --> 01:43:40.518]  I'm the wind.
[01:43:42.119 --> 01:43:42.780]  You're the wind.
[01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:45.261]  We are all the sails together in this.
[01:43:45.321 --> 01:43:53.106]  But if you hadn't resonated with what we talked about and what we did, if you hadn't prayed for us and spread the word and supported us, we wouldn't be here.
[01:43:53.707 --> 01:43:55.468]  If you hadn't been faithful,
[01:43:57.085 --> 01:44:07.491]  In our shared destiny together, we wouldn't have already had these successes and nationalism exploding across the world, and all the incredible positive things happening that have unfolded.
[01:44:09.233 --> 01:44:10.473]  But because of you, we've done that.
[01:44:11.374 --> 01:44:12.114]  There's an equation.
[01:44:13.175 --> 01:44:18.278]  If you spread the word about InfoWars, and the articles, the videos, the links, we get around the enemy.
[01:44:18.999 --> 01:44:20.860]  And if you fund
[01:44:22.113 --> 01:44:24.994]  The information we're producing, it all comes together.
[01:44:25.654 --> 01:44:27.595]  But it comes down to that, chicken or the egg.
[01:44:28.575 --> 01:44:39.139]  If you don't fund the seed money to keep Infowars on the air and to fight against the fake lawsuits and the attacks of Soros and Hillary and others, we won't have the information to put on air for all of you to spread.
[01:44:39.999 --> 01:44:47.101]  So each one is just as important, but the most critical point the enemy understands is cutting the funding off.
[01:44:48.422 --> 01:44:51.523]  They don't want to have us be live on air while all this unfolds.
[01:44:53.015 --> 01:44:58.860]  They don't want to have us be here while the globalists push their entire world government agenda and everything we've talked about comes true.
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:05.665]  They don't want us here when they try to assassinate nationalist and populist leaders and while they overrun Christian countries with radical Islamists.
[01:45:06.046 --> 01:45:06.886]  They want us off the air.
[01:45:08.908 --> 01:45:12.011]  And that's why I am in your hands, you are in my hands.
[01:45:12.391 --> 01:45:16.214]  If I give up, if I back down, if I waver, it's a big victory for the globalists.
[01:45:17.055 --> 01:45:20.518]  And if you back down, if you waver, it's a big victory for them as well.
[01:45:21.676 --> 01:45:24.417]  It's truly a life and death struggle.
[01:45:24.998 --> 01:45:26.579]  So all I'm going to say in closing is this.
[01:45:27.579 --> 01:45:29.000]  Our destinies are bound forever.
[01:45:30.601 --> 01:45:30.741]  And...
[01:45:32.443 --> 01:45:36.645]  Doing something this epic almost feels sick to say, hey, come give me your money.
[01:45:37.446 --> 01:45:39.027]  But you've seen what I've done with your money.
[01:45:39.047 --> 01:45:42.409]  I have waged war, fearlessly and tirelessly.
[01:45:42.549 --> 01:45:44.270]  I have dominated globalists.
[01:45:44.350 --> 01:45:45.790]  I have overrun their emplacements.
[01:45:46.311 --> 01:45:50.873]  We have spread the message of liberty in 1776 worldwide, and we are committed to that destiny.
[01:45:51.353 --> 01:45:53.975]  And so with pride, I tell you, financially support us.
[01:45:54.715 --> 01:45:58.757]  Any other war chief in a fight for freedom would just say, support me, give me the funding now.
[01:45:58.777 --> 01:45:59.338]  I say,
[01:46:00.851 --> 01:46:02.352]  Get products for the best out there.
[01:46:03.613 --> 01:46:04.693]  Win-win situation.
[01:46:04.934 --> 01:46:06.655]  Fund us, and we're unstoppable together.
[01:46:07.195 --> 01:46:10.537]  If we don't do that, there's no future, and we have no shared destiny.
[01:46:11.558 --> 01:46:19.022]  I'm very sad that Supermill Vitality, our flagship product, is no longer available when this sells out, because we can't get the wild, crafted herbs.
[01:46:19.523 --> 01:46:23.965]  The process it goes through is so organic, like making of wine, that it can't be produced anymore.
[01:46:24.726 --> 01:46:25.826]  So that's why it's the last run.
[01:46:26.837 --> 01:46:29.227]  It's available 50% off, even though it's our last run.
[01:46:29.709 --> 01:46:32.098]  MFORESTORE.COM because I want you to experience it before it's gone.
[01:46:32.995 --> 01:46:40.319]  But whatever you do, pray for InfoWars, spread the articles, spread the links, spread the videos, because without you, we are going to basically be destroyed.
[01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:43.421]  But with your support, together we all go into the future.
[01:46:43.801 --> 01:46:52.406]  Whatever you do, just remember that the power of you, via word of mouth, speaking out and taking action, is the most powerful thing in the universe, next to God.
[01:46:53.167 --> 01:47:00.651]  And for your support, and your undying prayers, I thank you, and I salute you, but more importantly, we are bound, and I love you.
[01:47:01.212 --> 01:47:01.592]  So thank you.
[01:47:06.846 --> 01:47:09.547]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:40.069 --> 01:47:52.240]  Coming up in the middle of the next hour, we have William Gein joining us from Alipac, and he is drafting Ann Coulter to challenge Donald Trump at the 2020 GOP primary.
[01:47:53.641 --> 01:47:57.264]  And again, the strategy is obviously to get Trump, they think, out of his daze.
[01:47:58.725 --> 01:48:00.146]  We'll see about that.
[01:48:01.026 --> 01:48:04.709]  So we're gonna have that story posted up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:48:05.029 --> 01:48:06.590]  Let's go to your phone calls right now.
[01:48:06.710 --> 01:48:12.194]  David, Carlos, Nick, David, Michael, Chip, Josh, Douglas, Alex, Anthony, Randy, and others.
[01:48:12.254 --> 01:48:14.035]  I'll at least get to those calls here today.
[01:48:15.016 --> 01:48:17.077]  And David's been holding the longest from California.
[01:48:17.117 --> 01:48:17.878]  Welcome to the Airwaves.
[01:48:20.139 --> 01:48:20.860]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:21.240]  Good, brother.
[01:48:22.714 --> 01:48:23.734]  It's good to be on your show.
[01:48:24.235 --> 01:48:25.055]  First time caller.
[01:48:25.075 --> 01:48:29.596]  Just concerned about the state of our country right now.
[01:48:30.317 --> 01:48:35.018]  What's happening to yourself, Roger Stone, and other journalists around the country.
[01:48:37.379 --> 01:48:49.483]  I've been waking up every morning with this sense of urgency, almost, that even funding you guys and trying to help you guys out with, you know, your guys' endeavors you guys are going through.
[01:48:49.503 --> 01:48:50.804]  I feel like
[01:48:51.656 --> 01:49:11.830]  There's something else that I need to be doing and the rest of us need to be doing, and it's kind of... I don't really have any sort of outlet besides, you know, you listening to you guys and trying to express all this other stuff, you know, what I hear from not just yourself, but people like Clyde Lewis, Ground Zero, everybody else.
[01:49:12.650 --> 01:49:15.032]  And it's just... I don't know.
[01:49:15.862 --> 01:49:17.764]  I have this sense of urgency right now, you know?
[01:49:36.064 --> 01:49:51.399]  When I gave Roger a job here, which is great, and he's paid, and then it also becomes this split where we may not get the funds to fund InfoWars, because the 24-7 Roger Stone fundraising is people then split it and say, well, we'll just give him a donation instead of InfoWars.
[01:49:51.859 --> 01:49:56.664]  I've got to have a talk with him about that, because we could win the battle, lose the war here because of that.
[01:49:56.824 --> 01:50:00.248]  So I hope people do support Roger, but InfoWars has a bill.
[01:50:01.513 --> 01:50:02.313]  Let's not exaggerate.
[01:50:02.874 --> 01:50:05.095]  At least 10 times what Roger Stones is, okay?
[01:50:06.156 --> 01:50:09.838]  And he's bringing in as much money as we're bringing in right now.
[01:50:10.258 --> 01:50:10.819]  And that's great.
[01:50:10.959 --> 01:50:11.979]  That's all fine and dandy.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.281]  I have 100 employees.
[01:50:15.301 --> 01:50:20.645]  I have all the bandwidth bills and all the equipment and I sent security up there with Roger and reporters up there and that costs money.
[01:50:21.685 --> 01:50:23.286]  And so, I'm not bitching or complaining.
[01:50:23.306 --> 01:50:25.808]  I'm going to have to make some decisions around here on a bunch of fronts.
[01:50:27.009 --> 01:50:27.629]  About layoffs.
[01:50:27.749 --> 01:50:28.930]  You know, laying Paul Watson off.
[01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:29.991]  Laying Roger Stone off.
[01:50:30.251 --> 01:50:31.352]  People that are paid more around here.
[01:50:32.332 --> 01:50:33.673]  I mean, I've told them point blank, too.
[01:50:33.733 --> 01:50:35.895]  I mean, that's where this is headed if we don't get the support.
[01:50:35.955 --> 01:50:36.915]  And hey, people don't want to support us.
[01:50:36.935 --> 01:50:37.376]  That's fine.
[01:50:38.076 --> 01:50:42.659]  I'm going to stay committed to this fight as long as I need to and stay as focused as I can.
[01:50:43.319 --> 01:50:44.180]  But I want to say this.
[01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:45.041]  I like Roger.
[01:50:45.101 --> 01:50:45.621]  Love him to death.
[01:50:45.841 --> 01:50:48.303]  Been his biggest supporter out there and I've gotten targeted because of it.
[01:50:49.138 --> 01:50:50.839]  But I'm not Roger Stone.
[01:50:50.959 --> 01:50:51.660]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:52.480]  I'm in full wars.
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:54.782]  I've been on air 23 years, 24 years.
[01:50:55.202 --> 01:50:56.863]  We've launched the thing against the globalists.
[01:50:56.923 --> 01:51:01.286]  And I'm, that's what I'm saying is I'm sick of just being associated with Donald Trump and Roger Stone.
[01:51:01.586 --> 01:51:02.807]  He's probably sick of being associated with me.
[01:51:03.027 --> 01:51:05.408]  And by that I'm not, it's not bad to be associated with Donald Trump.
[01:51:05.909 --> 01:51:08.570]  It's that, that's all I become associated with.
[01:51:08.670 --> 01:51:08.851]  Not
[01:51:09.691 --> 01:51:10.832]  Being right about screen time.
[01:51:11.072 --> 01:51:12.933]  Being right about the 3G and 4G and 5G.
[01:51:13.113 --> 01:51:14.353]  Being right about how you're being spied on.
[01:51:14.533 --> 01:51:15.554]  Being right about the world government.
[01:51:15.794 --> 01:51:17.015]  Being right about everything.
[01:51:17.415 --> 01:51:18.395]  We're the trailblazers.
[01:51:18.876 --> 01:51:21.197]  And I just see myself constantly caught up.
[01:51:21.997 --> 01:51:22.978]  Take the Sandy Hook thing.
[01:51:23.018 --> 01:51:24.058]  That is not my identity.
[01:51:24.138 --> 01:51:25.439]  I barely ever talked about that.
[01:51:25.859 --> 01:51:27.060]  Other people questioned it happened.
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:28.580]  They lied about babies in incubators.
[01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:29.541]  They lied about all these wars.
[01:51:29.761 --> 01:51:31.162]  They lied about all sorts of staged stuff.
[01:51:31.402 --> 01:51:37.585]  They got members of the European Union government questioning whether they're staging deaths of refugees to open the borders.
[01:51:38.425 --> 01:51:40.906]  That's normal to question government media that lies.
[01:51:41.307 --> 01:52:06.680]  Later you find out something did happen, you say fine it happened, but then those people make it your whole identity and say that I'm currently doing that to then turn me into basically Sandy Hook meets Donald Trump meets Roger Stone when that becomes a distraction and a diversion from the globalists trying to implode our borders, from the globalists trying to shut down our industries, from the globalists trying to set up martial law, from all the incredible censorship.
[01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:07.541]  I'm a diversion.
[01:52:09.286 --> 01:52:09.947]  I'm a diversion.
[01:52:10.327 --> 01:52:11.008]  I'm a diversion.
[01:52:11.848 --> 01:52:12.969]  My censorship is bad.
[01:52:13.009 --> 01:52:13.670]  I should be supported.
[01:52:14.351 --> 01:52:17.674]  But in that they only talk about me being censored now everywhere.
[01:52:18.354 --> 01:52:20.056]  First they demonized me, then they censored me.
[01:52:20.797 --> 01:52:22.518]  That supposedly then made it all okay.
[01:52:23.339 --> 01:52:23.619]  Okay?
[01:52:24.060 --> 01:52:26.242]  So now they've moved on to everyone else and nobody cares about them.
[01:52:26.282 --> 01:52:27.182]  It's all about Alex Jones.
[01:52:27.763 --> 01:52:29.084]  That's what I told people day one.
[01:52:29.164 --> 01:52:30.566]  So this is very, very sophisticated.
[01:52:31.026 --> 01:52:32.107]  So I'm not criticizing Trump.
[01:52:32.127 --> 01:52:33.028]  I'm not criticizing Roger.
[01:52:34.807 --> 01:52:35.848]  I'm not criticizing myself.
[01:52:36.608 --> 01:52:39.109]  I'm saying this is how the globalists engage you.
[01:52:39.890 --> 01:52:50.435]  Set up these false fights, where now we're going to spend half our time defending Roger on a fake indictment in a major war for the whole country and our children fighting the pedophiles.
[01:52:50.775 --> 01:53:04.362]  Now everything in InfoWars will become this stupid case and this stupid judge and stupid Mueller, instead of just warning people, hey, read what's in your tap water, read what's in the vaccines, hey, find out about the New World Order, hey, find out about the big picture.
[01:53:04.582 --> 01:53:05.142]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:53:06.203 --> 01:53:06.463]  I do.
[01:53:06.703 --> 01:53:06.943]  I do.
[01:53:07.144 --> 01:53:17.690]  And I feel like every single one of us is almost, you know, certainly under attack because it's just, it's hard to be away from pretty much the beast now.
[01:53:18.050 --> 01:53:26.335]  And unfortunately, it's just, it's discouraging, but we almost just got to follow like you do and just, you know, keep pushing, keep moving forward.
[01:53:26.635 --> 01:53:27.996]  I just wanted to say, God bless you.
[01:53:28.036 --> 01:53:29.617]  I pray for this country.
[01:53:29.657 --> 01:53:30.378]  I pray for our president.
[01:53:30.398 --> 01:53:31.198]  I pray for yourself.
[01:53:31.278 --> 01:53:32.299]  I pray for everybody else.
[01:53:33.035 --> 01:53:39.077]  You know, that may be going through this situation, whatever, but I just hope that... Well, I'll tell you, David, David, exactly.
[01:53:39.097 --> 01:53:42.878]  If people don't have money, they can't buy products, hey, that's fine.
[01:53:43.478 --> 01:53:51.980]  They can spread the word about however you're listening, and they can pray for info wars, and they can pray for America and the world to awaken, and for God's Spirit to move across this land.
[01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:53.140]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:53:53.561 --> 01:53:55.321]  And I didn't mean to go off into a rant about that.
[01:53:56.081 --> 01:53:58.162]  I just realized the tactics the globalists use.
[01:53:59.025 --> 01:54:03.631]  Where they say, Jones set up his media operation and his empire, which it's not.
[01:54:04.472 --> 01:54:08.958]  Jones set up his powerful, evil empire on the backs of Sandy Hook.
[01:54:08.999 --> 01:54:14.907]  And it's like not even a, not even a one-tenth of one percent of what we've covered.
[01:54:16.062 --> 01:54:20.045]  It's just, again, and then they use it to put Sandy Hook and school shootings back in the news.
[01:54:20.085 --> 01:54:21.166]  The lawyers, the Democrats do.
[01:54:21.606 --> 01:54:22.927]  And then they use it to demonize me.
[01:54:22.987 --> 01:54:23.988]  It's a tactic.
[01:54:24.068 --> 01:54:24.548]  It's sick.
[01:54:25.249 --> 01:54:29.392]  But it's the whole mainstream media that uses school shootings and hypes them up and then causes more of them.
[01:54:29.792 --> 01:54:31.953]  And now they're using my name to promote it.
[01:54:32.114 --> 01:54:33.474]  It's dastardly.
[01:54:34.495 --> 01:54:35.676]  It's absolutely evil.
[01:54:36.477 --> 01:54:38.998]  And it's going to be dealt with.
[01:54:39.098 --> 01:54:44.462]  It's just that we need massive support because BuzzFeed makes $300 million a year.
[01:54:46.092 --> 01:54:51.141]  They have to get another $100 million from George Soros for others to operate, and they're not as effective as we are.
[01:54:51.321 --> 01:54:51.962]  They're a bunch of liars.
[01:54:52.981 --> 01:55:00.165]  They have thousands of employees, hundreds of millions of dollars, and then the news is like, Jones says he brought in $40 million.
[01:55:00.565 --> 01:55:01.306]  He made $40 million.
[01:55:01.346 --> 01:55:04.267]  No, if I bring in $40 million, half of that's product cost.
[01:55:04.487 --> 01:55:09.270]  Then you pay all the employees, the crew, the bandwidth, all of it, and lawyers, and you lose money.
[01:55:09.930 --> 01:55:11.131]  That's what we're headed into.
[01:55:11.191 --> 01:55:13.232]  Exactly what they want.
[01:55:13.892 --> 01:55:14.973]  BuzzFeed can have $400 million.
[01:55:17.623 --> 01:55:19.664]  That's pure cash.
[01:55:20.224 --> 01:55:21.424]  That's not stuff they're selling.
[01:55:22.024 --> 01:55:32.327]  That's their actual revenues, $300 million, with another $100 million plopped on top to run around and make up pissgate stories and make up that Manafort visited Assange.
[01:55:33.128 --> 01:55:34.128]  All of that's made up.
[01:55:34.328 --> 01:55:35.228]  All of that's lies.
[01:55:35.689 --> 01:55:36.449]  All of that's crap.
[01:55:38.271 --> 01:55:44.514]  Their owner, this big neo-con leftist, neo-lib, is like, oh, we don't need unions.
[01:55:44.594 --> 01:55:45.534]  I'll never lay you off.
[01:55:45.554 --> 01:55:46.194]  We're a family.
[01:55:46.554 --> 01:55:48.895]  He won't even give them any severance pay.
[01:55:49.536 --> 01:55:51.156]  He even took their bonuses away.
[01:55:51.597 --> 01:55:53.417]  He even nickel-and-dimed them when he fired them.
[01:55:53.637 --> 01:55:58.139]  Those that had a month or two weeks of vacation, they didn't get jack crap.
[01:55:58.159 --> 01:56:02.241]  Because all the studies show, liberals aren't liberals.
[01:56:02.301 --> 01:56:03.181]  They're monsters.
[01:56:03.281 --> 01:56:05.502]  Jeff Bezos pays almost no taxes.
[01:56:05.842 --> 01:56:06.503]  He's paid money.
[01:56:07.904 --> 01:56:10.006]  On every item he ships by the U.S.
[01:56:10.026 --> 01:56:10.306]  government.
[01:56:11.527 --> 01:56:12.208]  He's a total pig.
[01:56:12.768 --> 01:56:15.290]  Google, Facebook, Apple, they run slave factories.
[01:56:16.331 --> 01:56:18.053]  These people are monsters!
[01:56:19.694 --> 01:56:23.698]  Studies show what liberals are nine times more likely not to give to charity.
[01:56:24.799 --> 01:56:25.739]  All the world's the same numbers.
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:27.761]  Six times more likely to steal.
[01:56:29.242 --> 01:56:35.408]  And many, many more times, though, more likely to tell you they're giving or they're doing something good, but they don't do it, you see.
[01:56:36.482 --> 01:56:39.904]  Because they're sociopaths, they're psychotics, they're control freaks.
[01:56:40.305 --> 01:56:45.468]  They put out movies where Ted Bundy's cool and sexy and has a fun love affair on Netflix.
[01:56:46.829 --> 01:56:52.032]  And he wasn't tying 16-year-old girls up in basements and torturing the hell out of them and biting big chunks out of them.
[01:56:52.953 --> 01:57:04.441]  So see, that's who these people are, and they've bred more of them, and they've created more of them, and all of our bowing down and all of our kissing their asses has absolutely supercharged them to come after everybody.
[01:57:06.363 --> 01:57:07.403]  It's a moral decline.
[01:57:08.083 --> 01:57:13.584]  It's a satanic plague that is upon our country and upon our world.
[01:57:13.604 --> 01:57:14.785]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:57:14.805 --> 01:57:15.465]  I just went to one.
[01:57:15.885 --> 01:57:21.226]  But I went off on a jag there because InfoWars is in the middle of the battle.
[01:57:21.986 --> 01:57:22.786]  And it's that simple.
[01:57:23.306 --> 01:57:25.787]  And so now realize, yeah, we've been, hey, we need help.
[01:57:25.827 --> 01:57:27.527]  Hey, we're in a fight all these years as we've been in one.
[01:57:27.887 --> 01:57:29.567]  Now we're in the main fight.
[01:57:30.267 --> 01:57:30.807]  This is it.
[01:57:31.808 --> 01:57:32.748]  Toe to toe with the globalists.
[01:57:32.788 --> 01:57:33.408]  Back in two minutes.
[01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:35.811]  I'll go to Carlos first.
[01:57:35.831 --> 01:57:37.412]  That's about tearing society apart.
[01:57:38.333 --> 01:57:40.034]  And everybody else, stay with us.
[01:57:40.535 --> 01:57:42.076]  And hey, whatever you do, share that link.
[01:57:42.176 --> 01:57:43.237]  Newswars.com.
[01:57:44.578 --> 01:57:45.438]  It upsets the globalists.
[01:57:45.719 --> 01:57:48.521]  Share that link with Bill Maher praising pedophilia with 12-year-olds.
[01:57:53.424 --> 01:57:53.885]  Here's the thing.
[01:57:53.905 --> 01:57:55.366]  I know how metaphysics works.
[01:57:55.446 --> 01:57:56.587]  I know how the universe works.
[01:57:57.267 --> 01:57:59.329]  I know how the cow ate the cabbage.
[01:58:00.530 --> 01:58:01.711]  If you're not expanding,
[01:58:03.353 --> 01:58:04.093]  You're imploding.
[01:58:04.714 --> 01:58:07.115]  There is no set stasis.
[01:58:08.656 --> 01:58:09.876]  There is no managed system.
[01:58:11.097 --> 01:58:14.578]  There is no... ...uncontinuum.
[01:58:15.439 --> 01:58:19.060]  The continuum is always launching forward... ...into the future.
[01:58:21.121 --> 01:58:29.585]  So... I can go on air and tell people that InfoWars could shut down.
[01:58:30.866 --> 01:58:32.247]  And that would be a very true statement.
[01:58:33.047 --> 01:58:40.195]  If I don't have the will, InfoWars could shut down tomorrow.
[01:58:40.275 --> 01:58:45.180]  If I fight as hard as I can, and people don't support us, we shut down in a year.
[01:58:46.642 --> 01:58:51.767]  You support us and get creative and get fired up, we won't just be here 100 years, we'll be here forever.
[01:58:51.787 --> 01:58:53.269]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[01:58:54.420 --> 01:59:02.630]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what, are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[01:59:03.011 --> 01:59:08.457]  Unlike all these other test cases that God put in place, you know, there's a lot of eggs.
[01:59:08.477 --> 01:59:09.939]  Like Christ said, I have other flocks.
[01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:11.281]  There's a lot of them.
[01:59:12.509 --> 01:59:13.089]  God's big.
[01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:14.630]  God makes a lot of stuff, you know?
[01:59:15.110 --> 01:59:16.851]  And, you know, I want to be on the winning team.
[01:59:16.931 --> 01:59:18.892]  I want to, like, hey, go, hey, come on in.
[01:59:19.273 --> 01:59:19.653]  You made it.
[01:59:20.033 --> 01:59:20.613]  Good to have you here.
[01:59:21.334 --> 01:59:27.777]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[01:59:28.777 --> 01:59:30.478]  And so this is playland.
[01:59:30.558 --> 01:59:31.599]  This is baby town.
[01:59:32.139 --> 01:59:32.920]  This is dressed up.
[01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:35.681]  This is like little boys playing soldier in the woods.
[01:59:36.321 --> 01:59:39.303]  All I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[01:59:40.243 --> 01:59:41.264]  I want to go to the next level.
[01:59:42.305 --> 01:59:45.666]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced.
[01:59:46.107 --> 01:59:47.227]  Not these devil worshippers.
[01:59:47.247 --> 01:59:49.968]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[01:59:50.128 --> 01:59:50.969]  I want life!
[01:59:51.529 --> 01:59:52.409]  I want Jesus!
[01:59:55.350 --> 01:59:59.452]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.972 --> 02:00:01.253]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:04.810 --> 02:00:18.453]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss.
[02:00:19.293 --> 02:00:21.593]  Another kiss.
[02:00:22.313 --> 02:00:23.614]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:23.634 --> 02:00:24.474]  Carlos in Texas.
[02:00:24.514 --> 02:00:25.194]  Thanks for calling in.
[02:00:25.214 --> 02:00:25.674]  You're on the air.
[02:00:25.714 --> 02:00:26.914]  Welcome.
[02:00:27.274 --> 02:00:29.755]  Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:00:29.995 --> 02:00:30.395]  Good, brother.
[02:00:30.435 --> 02:00:30.955]  Thanks for calling.
[02:00:32.505 --> 02:00:34.707]  First-time caller, long-time listener.
[02:00:34.727 --> 02:00:41.453]  I am from the, I think it's Sector 6 in Texas.
[02:00:41.513 --> 02:00:42.473]  I'm from Houston.
[02:00:44.215 --> 02:00:46.677]  Alex, I've been listening to you for a long time.
[02:00:46.697 --> 02:00:48.999]  Is it okay if I do a plug real quick?
[02:00:49.039 --> 02:00:50.460]  I've been using your products for a while.
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:53.682]  Sure, please.
[02:00:54.003 --> 02:00:57.906]  I live by the Silver.
[02:00:58.806 --> 02:01:00.708]  Oh God, I don't know why I'm so nervous.
[02:01:01.679 --> 02:01:02.940]  Silver Bullet.
[02:01:03.601 --> 02:01:04.501]  The Silver Bullet.
[02:01:04.601 --> 02:01:06.003]  I am all for the Silver Bullet.
[02:01:06.523 --> 02:01:09.265]  It's helped me during these cold winters.
[02:01:09.285 --> 02:01:15.370]  You know, I'm a construction worker, so it helps keep me nice and healthy while I'm working outside.
[02:01:17.712 --> 02:01:23.757]  But I did want to talk to you, or talk to everybody, or just, you know, just bring it up.
[02:01:24.077 --> 02:01:28.120]  The degradation of our society, you know, they're trying to make us genderless.
[02:01:29.363 --> 02:01:35.085]  My daughter asked me about it the other day, and, you know, I come from a Christian background.
[02:01:35.145 --> 02:01:36.325]  My parents are pastors.
[02:01:36.985 --> 02:01:41.746]  I've been in church my whole life, and I explained to my daughter, and we even went into Scripture about it.
[02:01:41.807 --> 02:01:54.470]  You know, it's not about us not being greater than other people or thinking that we're better than them, but the Bible tells us clearly, you know, that it's immoral to be
[02:01:55.519 --> 02:01:57.301]  You know, a homosexual.
[02:01:58.502 --> 02:02:03.706]  Homosexual or being genderless in all its totality.
[02:02:04.107 --> 02:02:05.608]  We are men and women.
[02:02:05.668 --> 02:02:07.049]  That's the way we're born.
[02:02:08.450 --> 02:02:11.072]  Carlos, you shouldn't have to apologize for pointing out the sky's blue.
[02:02:11.453 --> 02:02:12.514]  It's in Brave New World.
[02:02:12.594 --> 02:02:13.595]  It's the UN plan.
[02:02:13.715 --> 02:02:18.539]  It's in Brave New World Revisited Nonfiction to make us genderless, to stop us reproducing.
[02:02:18.959 --> 02:02:20.620]  So they say, oh, you're not moral.
[02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:24.022]  Let us adults, who aren't parents, teach your kid about sex.
[02:02:24.062 --> 02:02:25.162]  That's called being a pervert.
[02:02:25.622 --> 02:02:30.645]  People need to start filing lawsuits against these school districts and not putting up with being buffaloed by this crap.
[02:02:31.025 --> 02:02:36.628]  So I just tell your daughter point blank, this is a scientific plan to confuse her and mess her up so she never has kids.
[02:02:38.387 --> 02:02:43.371]  I, Alex, I actually, I listen to you every single day.
[02:02:43.431 --> 02:02:46.513]  You, Owen, I listen to Dave, I listen to all of you guys.
[02:02:47.014 --> 02:02:48.535]  I bore the crap out of my wife with it.
[02:02:48.615 --> 02:02:58.542]  I scare my wife sometimes, but like I tell her, it's important that we know this so we can teach our children and so we can red pill other people within our sphere.
[02:02:59.341 --> 02:03:06.743]  It's so difficult to talk to people who have closed minds or that actually don't want to know about this stuff, Alex.
[02:03:07.103 --> 02:03:17.906]  It drives me nuts because even within my own family, you know, I was going to have my aunt who was going to vote for Beto and Beto 2018, and I'm like, Tia, which means aunt.
[02:03:18.466 --> 02:03:28.028]  I told her, aunt, you know, Beto supports abortion, and then I sent her a pamphlet of all his talking points, and she ended up voting for Ted Cruz, who is pro-life.
[02:03:29.788 --> 02:03:35.209]  They were stealing the election for pedo, so it's a good thing you did that.
[02:03:35.229 --> 02:03:38.990]  But absolutely, every person you reach out to gets around the system.
[02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:40.070]  And they used to ignore us.
[02:03:40.510 --> 02:03:41.591]  They thought we didn't have any power.
[02:03:41.611 --> 02:03:42.511]  They thought you didn't have any power.
[02:03:42.811 --> 02:03:46.912]  Now they're trying to censor everybody because they know we've got a good chance of stopping these monsters.
[02:03:47.292 --> 02:03:48.052]  And we don't have a choice.
[02:03:48.072 --> 02:03:50.532]  I mean, like you said, they're coming after our children.
[02:03:50.932 --> 02:03:52.373]  Your daughter, I mean, how old is your daughter?
[02:03:52.393 --> 02:03:53.613]  She shouldn't be hearing about this crap.
[02:03:54.682 --> 02:04:11.814]  Oh my gosh, she's 12, but there's a show on, I don't know if it's Nickelodeon or Disney, it's called Andy Mack, and it talks about how there's this little boy in there who likes Andy Mack.
[02:04:12.797 --> 02:04:16.321]  Uh, a love interest in the show, like, and these are all little kids, and there's little boys.
[02:04:16.361 --> 02:04:21.587]  No, but that's okay, because, because, I mean, Kid loves the name of Bill Maher's production company.
[02:04:21.627 --> 02:04:24.790]  He says 12-year-olds having sex with 35-year-olds is love.
[02:04:25.291 --> 02:04:30.496]  There's nothing wrong with Bill Maher saying the actual Nambla slogan is the name of his production company.
[02:04:30.857 --> 02:04:31.678]  Everything's okay.
[02:04:31.918 --> 02:04:32.599]  Don't be hateful.
[02:04:32.659 --> 02:04:34.401]  It's just love, Carlos.
[02:04:35.732 --> 02:04:36.472]  I know, I know.
[02:04:36.532 --> 02:04:37.153]  But you know what?
[02:04:38.373 --> 02:04:43.516]  And this came up, the question, and I talk to my daughter all the time about what's right and what's wrong.
[02:04:44.356 --> 02:04:51.060]  And I'm hoping to instruct her the way I was raised, the way I was raised in a Christian home.
[02:04:51.100 --> 02:04:53.441]  Like, okay, this is right, this is wrong.
[02:04:53.841 --> 02:04:56.663]  But eventually, she's going to get to a point where she's going to have to make her own decisions.
[02:04:56.723 --> 02:04:58.684]  And hopefully, the way I raised her... Absolutely.
[02:04:58.764 --> 02:04:59.604]  Great job, Carlos.
[02:04:59.624 --> 02:05:00.125]  God bless you.
[02:05:00.145 --> 02:05:00.825]  Thanks for the support.
[02:05:01.465 --> 02:05:02.726]  Josh, and many others, your calls.
[02:05:05.256 --> 02:05:06.217]  Now, you've stayed vigilant.
[02:05:06.237 --> 02:05:07.319]  You've been pushing the site.
[02:05:07.359 --> 02:05:08.560]  You've been helping us get it out there.
[02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:12.205]  But if you don't keep pushing, this is an ongoing fight we're going to lose.
[02:05:12.405 --> 02:05:15.489]  So please, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:05:15.609 --> 02:05:16.571]  Get that link out to everybody.
[02:05:16.691 --> 02:05:20.636]  And please remember InfoWarsStore.com, where we have the very best fish oil.
[02:05:20.796 --> 02:05:22.017]  We're good to go.
[02:05:47.148 --> 02:05:49.570]  TurboForce is the ultimate vitamin mineral.
[02:05:49.630 --> 02:05:53.392]  Total energy, fusion, next level, total mega package.
[02:05:53.452 --> 02:05:54.633]  Nothing else is even near it.
[02:05:54.773 --> 02:06:00.517]  Get TurboForce today at InfoWarsLive.com, but I recommend you only take half a dose the first time.
[02:06:00.637 --> 02:06:02.498]  Beware the power of TurboForce!
[02:06:16.359 --> 02:06:18.507]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:19.009 --> 02:06:20.434]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:54.599 --> 02:07:02.128]  When we have children in cages, crying for their mothers and fathers, don't you dare call that border security!
[02:07:02.148 --> 02:07:04.231]  That's a human rights abuse!
[02:07:14.417 --> 02:07:27.726]  Kamala Harris, the so-called frontrunner in the Democratic field, running against Trump in 2020, going for the nomination, the Democratic Party, she says that we just need free health care, free education, and no borders.
[02:07:28.527 --> 02:07:33.790]  While she was behind big iron fences and security, hundreds and hundreds of police officers for her announcement.
[02:07:34.891 --> 02:07:37.093]  You're like, but that kills common sense.
[02:07:37.113 --> 02:07:39.074]  I mean, every country has to have borders or it's not a nation.
[02:07:39.715 --> 02:07:42.997]  Especially if you're bordering a really dangerous, collapsed third world.
[02:07:45.307 --> 02:07:58.931]  Again, this is the War on Logic, and we've got such a giant, dumbed-down mass of people in this country now, and the average person that is smart and informed doesn't want to get politically involved, so the spread of evil is expanding.
[02:08:00.772 --> 02:08:03.093]  Okay, let's go ahead and take some more calls here.
[02:08:03.133 --> 02:08:04.873]  Who's been holding the longest?
[02:08:06.754 --> 02:08:11.916]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andy in Connecticut.
[02:08:11.956 --> 02:08:13.016]  Well, Andy had been on the longest.
[02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:17.761]  David in Connecticut's been holding the longest on socialism.
[02:08:17.801 --> 02:08:18.141]  Go ahead.
[02:08:19.781 --> 02:08:20.361]  Yes, sir.
[02:08:21.021 --> 02:08:21.342]  Welcome.
[02:08:21.542 --> 02:08:22.102]  Can you hear me?
[02:08:22.362 --> 02:08:22.862]  I sure can.
[02:08:24.042 --> 02:08:25.423]  All right.
[02:08:25.683 --> 02:08:32.644]  When it comes to socialism, this is going to be something we're actually going to need with this whole technocracy coming up.
[02:08:32.944 --> 02:08:43.247]  It's unfortunate we got crazy people in government that we can't trust, but you got machines taking jobs for the past 10 years.
[02:08:45.999 --> 02:08:58.722]  And without, I'd say 20 years from now, people, 50% of this population is going to lose their jobs.
[02:08:59.722 --> 02:09:02.843]  You know, it's almost the only viable solution.
[02:09:04.943 --> 02:09:08.484]  Well, you're a smart cookie, David, but let's go one step further.
[02:09:08.524 --> 02:09:13.225]  The globalists admit they're forcing a type of robotics technocracy
[02:09:14.756 --> 02:09:26.382]  System that replaces humans and makes us obsolete and then they're just going to entertain us to death literally With sterilization and things like that to get your welfare money and of course that'll sound reasonable good sterilize the welfare people but
[02:09:27.310 --> 02:09:28.090]  It'll never end.
[02:09:28.150 --> 02:09:30.751]  The global social score, the total control.
[02:09:31.171 --> 02:09:37.214]  We're entering into a literal Brave New World where by law, your children will be inducted to be sterilized.
[02:09:37.494 --> 02:09:40.375]  They'll be convinced to do it by brainwashing techniques.
[02:09:40.395 --> 02:09:44.216]  And then if you stand in the way, you won't get your credit money for the year.
[02:09:44.256 --> 02:09:46.677]  But if you allow it, you'll be praised and be cool.
[02:09:47.217 --> 02:09:51.178]  So this is the most hellish evil system the planet has ever created.
[02:09:51.218 --> 02:09:54.980]  And so they're building a world where humans are obsolete by design.
[02:09:56.054 --> 02:09:57.015]  Oh, it's the coolest thing.
[02:09:57.656 --> 02:09:59.297]  Robots that cook your food at a restaurant.
[02:09:59.357 --> 02:10:00.678]  Robots that drive you in your car.
[02:10:01.038 --> 02:10:02.219]  Robots that fly your plane.
[02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:12.908]  And every study shows taking ourselves out of the equation weakens us, you know, like the people floating around on the cruise ship in the movie WALL-E.
[02:10:13.549 --> 02:10:17.672]  So they're designing it so that by the time we realize we've been taken over,
[02:10:18.713 --> 02:10:22.976]  Our manhood, our humanity, our womanhood, our resistance is vestigial.
[02:10:23.816 --> 02:10:24.677]  It's not really there.
[02:10:24.817 --> 02:10:32.982]  It's a shrunken version of itself because we had already been soft killed by the time we figured out the final blow was dropping.
[02:10:33.302 --> 02:10:34.302]  That's why they want me off the air.
[02:10:34.322 --> 02:10:39.686]  They don't want people to reignite their life force, to reignite their sense of destiny and realize what's happening.
[02:10:45.149 --> 02:10:46.870]  In an old convalescent home,
[02:10:47.498 --> 02:10:53.922]  And say what the heck did our kids do to us, because they're going to give this, they're going to give their freedoms away.
[02:10:54.702 --> 02:10:57.124]  And it's scary.
[02:10:58.625 --> 02:11:02.127]  But I appreciate you and your voice.
[02:11:03.307 --> 02:11:06.569]  And I'm a daily listener, second time caller.
[02:11:08.090 --> 02:11:09.651]  Keep the fight going.
[02:11:10.111 --> 02:11:11.152]  Brother, I appreciate you.
[02:11:11.192 --> 02:11:11.912]  Keep waking up.
[02:11:11.932 --> 02:11:12.833]  Appreciate you, David.
[02:11:12.893 --> 02:11:14.854]  But David summed up the whole broadcast today.
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:18.762]  An artificial system is being built to make us obsolete.
[02:11:20.703 --> 02:11:24.606]  And then they'll be able to social engineer us however they want because we're not going to have jobs.
[02:11:25.006 --> 02:11:29.269]  We're not going to know how to take care of ourselves, grow crops, fix a car.
[02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:32.011]  It'll be illegal to fix your car.
[02:11:32.051 --> 02:11:34.753]  It's all going to be special facilities that do it, you know, for the environment.
[02:11:35.253 --> 02:11:37.875]  Everything's being designed to take humans out of their environment.
[02:11:40.677 --> 02:11:42.298]  This is a giant petri dish.
[02:11:42.318 --> 02:11:44.220]  This is a giant scientific test.
[02:11:45.441 --> 02:11:46.742]  And are we going to really do this to our children?
[02:11:47.882 --> 02:11:48.563]  No, we already have.
[02:11:50.084 --> 02:11:57.148]  And if we'll put up with, you know, 3 million little boys in the country that can't talk and are wearing diapers when they're 20 years old, we'll put up with 50 million.
[02:11:57.468 --> 02:11:58.008]  And we're going to.
[02:11:58.409 --> 02:11:58.929]  We're going to die.
[02:12:01.158 --> 02:12:07.542]  And it'll only be the robots and automation and reclamation that takes care of the processing that half your neighbors have cancer.
[02:12:08.123 --> 02:12:09.444]  And if they've got money, they can battle it.
[02:12:09.784 --> 02:12:12.506]  And everybody's got allergies so bad that nobody can hardly even eat food.
[02:12:12.946 --> 02:12:18.389]  It's because of all the GMO, all the pathogens, all the multi-layered binary weapons.
[02:12:18.710 --> 02:12:21.672]  And again, the globalists wrote books on how they were going to do this.
[02:12:22.652 --> 02:12:24.714]  And we're now seeing what the world government's like.
[02:12:27.215 --> 02:12:28.176]  We're now understanding.
[02:12:29.949 --> 02:12:31.130]  So, now you understand.
[02:12:31.250 --> 02:12:34.311]  And people like Joe Rogan think his family's going to be safe because he goes along with this?
[02:12:34.331 --> 02:12:36.933]  And other people think they're going to be part of the system, they're going to be okay?
[02:12:36.973 --> 02:12:37.373]  No, you're not.
[02:12:40.995 --> 02:12:43.016]  And that's the big thing, is we should... there are...
[02:12:45.365 --> 02:12:47.727]  Millions of people now that serve the cult in the U.S.
[02:12:47.767 --> 02:12:48.007]  alone.
[02:12:48.548 --> 02:12:56.234]  Thousands that are actually in control positions, and their religion is hating the population, hating children, hating the future, and wanting to be predators.
[02:12:56.595 --> 02:12:59.497]  And they'll do whatever they're told, and they have a horrible attitude towards humanity.
[02:13:00.178 --> 02:13:08.725]  And then as they successively add more pressure to the population, we become more demonic, that just legitimizes what they're doing, because they're the people making us like they are.
[02:13:10.458 --> 02:13:14.761]  All the movies about serial killers are cool, and pedophilia is cool, and devil worship's cool.
[02:13:14.821 --> 02:13:15.681]  It's everywhere now.
[02:13:17.663 --> 02:13:19.504]  Because they're making their move, folks.
[02:13:21.265 --> 02:13:23.526]  Speaking of devil worship, John in Arizona wants to talk about it.
[02:13:23.566 --> 02:13:23.867]  Go ahead.
[02:13:26.789 --> 02:13:28.029]  Hey Alex, it's Josh.
[02:13:30.691 --> 02:13:32.332]  I'm so happy to be talking to you.
[02:13:32.352 --> 02:13:33.533]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:13:33.613 --> 02:13:34.113]  Thanks for calling.
[02:13:34.133 --> 02:13:37.135]  And thank you for grabbing the bull by the horns.
[02:13:37.696 --> 02:13:39.797]  I mean, it must feel amazing
[02:13:40.273 --> 02:13:58.623]  To see a, you know, pseudo healthcare professional doctor touting the party line on Fox News, countering the measures that you've put into action in terms of raising awareness to vaccination.
[02:13:58.643 --> 02:13:59.483]  I think it's amazing.
[02:14:00.544 --> 02:14:01.765]  Well, sir, please don't thank me.
[02:14:01.805 --> 02:14:02.905]  I'm thanking you for the support.
[02:14:03.125 --> 02:14:04.026]  We're all in this together.
[02:14:04.946 --> 02:14:10.209]  But if people really knew how real this was, they wouldn't care about being cool or being in Hollywood or being part of the power structure.
[02:14:10.609 --> 02:14:13.290]  This is the takedown of the planet by the globalists.
[02:14:14.891 --> 02:14:20.534]  Well, you're leading the fight and nobody's grabbed the bull by the horns as you have.
[02:14:20.894 --> 02:14:22.434]  So it's amazing.
[02:14:22.855 --> 02:14:29.558]  And my thoughts and prayers are with David Knight and I hope that he recovers expediently and
[02:14:30.288 --> 02:14:34.969]  And his voice is back on the air soon.
[02:14:36.089 --> 02:14:37.150]  So I just wanted to say that.
[02:14:37.570 --> 02:14:49.913]  But anyways, Alex, the reason I called, I have a background in physiological sciences, and I was listening last week when Jan Irving was on, I think it was last week.
[02:14:50.113 --> 02:14:51.313]  Yes.
[02:14:51.673 --> 02:14:54.214]  Right before he disconnected,
[02:14:55.374 --> 02:14:56.835]  He mentioned adrenochrome.
[02:14:57.015 --> 02:15:13.068]  The whole thing was about devil worship and the globalists and the power of persuasion that psychotropics kind of induce.
[02:15:13.909 --> 02:15:18.853]  And a few weeks prior to that, you had a caller, Leonard,
[02:15:20.632 --> 02:15:35.460]  That was addressing the Podesta emails and devil worship, and I know that you reference these emails a lot, but I think I'd like to propose an alternative definition for walnut sauce, because I think it's... Give it quick!
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:35.960]  Give it quick!
[02:15:36.020 --> 02:15:36.480]  We want a break.
[02:15:36.741 --> 02:15:37.201]  Alright, alright.
[02:15:37.801 --> 02:15:40.062]  So... Hold on, I'll have to come to you after the guest.
[02:15:40.122 --> 02:15:41.083]  We'll have to come to you after the guest.
[02:15:41.103 --> 02:15:41.723]  Stay with us, folks.
[02:15:41.743 --> 02:15:42.644]  We'll be right back after this break.
[02:15:58.746 --> 02:15:59.487]  InfoWars.
[02:15:59.847 --> 02:16:00.728]  Tomorrow's news.
[02:16:01.028 --> 02:16:01.509]  Today.
[02:16:05.252 --> 02:16:07.914]  I have not come to grips with how I'm supposed to announce this.
[02:16:09.256 --> 02:16:21.266]  And that's how I always say, this is coming up and I announce it right there, but I need to really think about this and look at it carefully before I make the announcement because I'm not quite sure what's happening or what we should do, but we're not going to be able to expand.
[02:16:22.387 --> 02:16:23.969]  And if we're not expanding, that means we're contracting.
[02:16:25.009 --> 02:16:27.397]  And then I look up and I say, I haven't cut new ads in weeks.
[02:16:27.799 --> 02:16:29.103]  I don't promote the products we've got.
[02:16:29.123 --> 02:16:30.327]  So it's my fault.
[02:16:30.347 --> 02:16:31.692]  But at the same time, I just want to cover news.
[02:16:33.382 --> 02:16:41.786]  I just need everybody listening to understand this is history happening, and if you don't go buy the products, and if you don't routinely buy them, sign up for AutoShip to get fluoride-free toothpaste.
[02:16:41.906 --> 02:16:44.207]  It's concentrated, 4 to 5 o'clock, with a little silver and iodine.
[02:16:44.287 --> 02:16:48.369]  And if you don't get our new TurboForce, that's beyond any energy drink you've ever had.
[02:16:48.449 --> 02:16:55.692]  It's healthy with all the trace elements and minerals and vitamin C and the amino acids and the organic caffeine stimulants.
[02:16:55.732 --> 02:16:56.292]  It's incredible.
[02:16:56.352 --> 02:16:58.053]  TurboForce, 33% off out of the gate.
[02:16:58.193 --> 02:17:02.875]  If you don't go get the products, the best fish oil for adults, the best fish oil for kids, Honor Roll,
[02:17:02.995 --> 02:17:04.056]  We don't get the very best.
[02:17:04.136 --> 02:17:04.676]  It's the best!
[02:17:04.776 --> 02:17:08.359]  I go up to top firms and say, I want to go above the top brand in the country.
[02:17:08.419 --> 02:17:09.980]  They go, what, 1% so you can say that?
[02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:10.341]  No!
[02:17:10.361 --> 02:17:11.422]  50% above them.
[02:17:11.502 --> 02:17:12.903]  Well, that won't fit in the capsule.
[02:17:13.023 --> 02:17:14.684]  Okay, we're 20% above the very best.
[02:17:14.904 --> 02:17:15.805]  And we're lower priced!
[02:17:15.925 --> 02:17:18.007]  That's our body's turmeric.
[02:17:18.147 --> 02:17:18.707]  Our fish oil.
[02:17:18.907 --> 02:17:19.408]  The best.
[02:17:19.588 --> 02:17:20.168]  The cleanest.
[02:17:20.268 --> 02:17:20.729]  The best.
[02:17:20.829 --> 02:17:21.349]  The cleanest.
[02:17:21.449 --> 02:17:25.212]  At a price lower than they sell Jeff Bezos at the damn Whole Foods.
[02:17:25.392 --> 02:17:31.317]  I'll tell you again, my job would be a lot easier if I didn't spend my time scrounging around for money.
[02:17:31.397 --> 02:17:34.000]  But you can sure as hell see that we're in the fight for our lives.
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:37.764]  So, you've all been committed to us, and you've bought a ton of great products that you love.
[02:17:37.964 --> 02:17:40.647]  Average 5.8 star on third-party review sites.
[02:17:40.807 --> 02:17:48.256]  But, if I don't get up here and explain to people that it's do or die, people don't take action and don't get the product.
[02:17:48.316 --> 02:17:48.436]  So...
[02:17:49.637 --> 02:17:50.578]  Here's what it comes down to.
[02:17:50.918 --> 02:17:53.540]  I don't want to cancel some of the shows we already have.
[02:17:53.700 --> 02:17:56.802]  And I sure as hell don't want to start curtailing how many reporters we have.
[02:17:56.842 --> 02:17:58.403]  We need more reporters.
[02:17:58.423 --> 02:17:59.064]  20 more reporters.
[02:17:59.424 --> 02:18:00.545]  I've got big plans.
[02:18:00.645 --> 02:18:01.585]  The enemy knows it.
[02:18:01.705 --> 02:18:03.146]  But I need money.
[02:18:03.407 --> 02:18:05.908]  All my assets is enough to run this place for three months.
[02:18:06.068 --> 02:18:08.250]  Again, I don't want the private jet airplane.
[02:18:08.650 --> 02:18:09.912]  I don't want the big mansions.
[02:18:10.292 --> 02:18:23.507]  I want to see the globalists in prison and I want to see them not teaching five-year-olds how to put dresses on little boys and I want to defeat this whole thing but I need cold hard cash from a barrel head and I need you to commit and say I'm not giving
[02:18:24.247 --> 02:18:35.911]  I'm going to tithe every month to InfoWarsTore.com and I'm going to get products I need.
[02:18:36.131 --> 02:18:37.572]  I'm going to get things that are good.
[02:18:37.752 --> 02:18:38.692]  Buy books monthly.
[02:18:38.792 --> 02:18:39.833]  Buy videos monthly.
[02:18:39.993 --> 02:18:41.953]  After you're done watching them, donate them to the library.
[02:18:42.153 --> 02:18:42.894]  Hundreds will see it.
[02:18:42.994 --> 02:18:45.455]  Get the fish oil you need for your brain, your heart, your liver.
[02:18:45.535 --> 02:18:46.475]  Get it for your children.
[02:18:46.595 --> 02:18:52.517]  If you're in the military or law enforcement or want to work out hard or just want that turbo force energy, turbo force.
[02:18:52.697 --> 02:18:53.839]  There's nothing like it!
[02:18:53.919 --> 02:18:59.586]  It will be the number one next-level energy drink healthy alternative in the world if you just try it.
[02:18:59.726 --> 02:19:00.287]  It's simple.
[02:19:00.427 --> 02:19:01.949]  Other corporations don't do that.
[02:19:01.989 --> 02:19:08.057]  They go, we're gonna put it all in marketing, have a bunch of girls in swimsuits and NFL players say it's great, and then it's a bunch of crap.
[02:19:08.257 --> 02:19:09.479]  This is the best.
[02:19:09.639 --> 02:19:11.001]  This is TurboForce.
[02:19:11.181 --> 02:19:12.561]  That's not in competition with brain force.
[02:19:12.681 --> 02:19:13.422]  It's a nootropic.
[02:19:13.442 --> 02:19:14.102]  A little bit of energy.
[02:19:14.202 --> 02:19:15.202]  Knocks people's socks off.
[02:19:15.222 --> 02:19:16.622]  Because you never have the nootropic with the energy.
[02:19:16.722 --> 02:19:19.143]  This is everything with the nootropic and the energy.
[02:19:19.283 --> 02:19:22.004]  And quite frankly, most people should take a quarter to a half packet of it.
[02:19:22.024 --> 02:19:25.925]  Because I wanted to have the biggest, meanest, baddest thing out there that's healthy and clean.
[02:19:26.025 --> 02:19:28.405]  And it's just too damn Tyrannosaurus Rex.
[02:19:28.545 --> 02:19:31.486]  I mean, it is just fire-breathing amazing.
[02:19:31.566 --> 02:19:34.587]  So we did it again, thanks to the good Lord and the commitment to do it.
[02:19:34.687 --> 02:19:36.067]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:19:38.968 --> 02:19:43.152]  And it's a contest between our wills, Soros' will, and your will!
[02:19:43.753 --> 02:19:48.657]  InfoWars is only a focal point, but if you focus on what we're doing and pray for us, we pray for you.
[02:19:48.938 --> 02:19:51.020]  We're together and we're unstoppable!
[02:20:06.371 --> 02:20:08.956]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:37.549 --> 02:20:43.832]  Well, William Gein heads up Alipac.us, one of the largest, strongest, no-compromise groups defending our sovereignty.
[02:20:44.332 --> 02:20:45.873]  But now, he's had one like 10 years ago.
[02:20:46.293 --> 02:20:47.193]  He's had it on a couple years.
[02:20:47.793 --> 02:20:49.814]  Everything he's talked about and others have talked about has come true.
[02:20:49.874 --> 02:20:53.856]  The UN funding it, world government trying to collapse our borders.
[02:20:53.876 --> 02:20:54.997]  It's just gotten crazy.
[02:20:55.957 --> 02:20:59.679]  And he had a big article that went viral at Alipac.us.
[02:21:03.156 --> 02:21:06.200]  Why I want Ann Coulter to run for president in 2020.
[02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:10.986]  So here to break down what's behind this idea is William Gein.
[02:21:11.006 --> 02:21:11.766]  William, good to have you with us.
[02:21:12.728 --> 02:21:13.068]  Hey, Alex.
[02:21:13.088 --> 02:21:14.689]  It's great to be back after a long time.
[02:21:14.769 --> 02:21:18.632]  And, you know, you've been through a lot since the last time I got to talk to you.
[02:21:18.652 --> 02:21:22.874]  I just wanted to thank you real quick for hanging in there and really continue what you're doing.
[02:21:22.894 --> 02:21:28.157]  I think you've red-pilled more people in the country than anyone else, and they can't take you down.
[02:21:28.197 --> 02:21:35.441]  I think they pulled the plug on you simultaneously because they had tried and tried and tried to slow you down, and you always found a way to keep coming back.
[02:21:35.482 --> 02:21:39.124]  And I know that the key to that has been the strength of the audience that's listening today.
[02:21:39.844 --> 02:21:59.467]  Your supporters, Alex Jones, they keep pushing you forward and I hear you calling them to do that more and I just wanted to take a moment to appreciate that because I think how you've been able to stay in the fight and never surrender on these issues is an inspiration to others or should be an inspiration to others both that you're doing that and some of the techniques that you've used to be able to do that.
[02:22:00.154 --> 02:22:08.179]  Well, I appreciate you, brother, but we're all in this together, and you know the war they've been waging on anybody that's for the country existing, anybody that believes in sovereignty.
[02:22:08.439 --> 02:22:13.942]  They are pushing hard against you, against everybody, because we started to win the last few years.
[02:22:13.982 --> 02:22:23.108]  But it appears, and I agree with you, that the swamp is starting to have Trump bog into it, and I think what you've been saying about only really getting on his butt will get him to come out of his malaise.
[02:22:23.128 --> 02:22:25.169]  So let's talk about your plan to get culture to run.
[02:22:25.905 --> 02:22:38.648]  Well, one of the things I want people to realize, because I know, as you know, that when I get off this show, there'll be a lot of people screaming that I'm fake news, and I'll be told that I'm some type of liberal plant, and I'll also be told that I am a never-Trumper.
[02:22:39.528 --> 02:22:53.332]  For the record, for those not familiar with me, I voted for Trump, I donated to Trump, I volunteered for Trump, I rallied on overpasses for Trump, I attended Trump's inauguration, and when I endorsed Trump, which was the first presidential
[02:22:54.012 --> 02:22:56.873]  Ali Pak, we usually endorse congressional candidates and U.S.
[02:22:56.913 --> 02:23:03.536]  Senate candidates that we believe support the existing immigration laws instead of any form of amnesty that would permanently destroy our borders.
[02:23:04.617 --> 02:23:08.778]  We never had endorsed, in our 15-year history, a presidential candidate.
[02:23:09.118 --> 02:23:22.504]  And the reason I endorsed Donald Trump was because he took the things that I've been saying and that you've been saying, combined with doing something that had never been possible before, putting the victims of illegal aid and criminals
[02:23:23.244 --> 02:23:24.385]  On stage with him.
[02:23:25.445 --> 02:23:26.025]  I endorsed him.
[02:23:26.105 --> 02:23:30.127]  And when I did, I blew apart about, you know, the people that sustain your operation.
[02:23:30.167 --> 02:23:34.049]  Well, I lost about a third of my financial backers when I endorsed Trump.
[02:23:34.089 --> 02:23:35.510]  And many of them sent me the same messages.
[02:23:35.530 --> 02:23:36.850]  They're like, William, we trust you.
[02:23:36.890 --> 02:23:37.811]  We believe what you're saying.
[02:23:38.151 --> 02:23:39.251]  We just don't trust Trump.
[02:23:39.311 --> 02:23:44.593]  We don't think that he is sincere about what he's saying and what he's doing.
[02:23:44.614 --> 02:23:49.536]  We understand that what he's saying and doing is what we want to hear, but they just didn't believe it.
[02:23:49.576 --> 02:23:52.377]  So I took a big hit to support Donald Trump.
[02:23:52.857 --> 02:23:59.159]  Now, since that time, we've had to drop our endorsement of Donald Trump because he did not keep his promise to end DACA amnesty on day one.
[02:24:00.080 --> 02:24:01.460]  We did not abandon him quickly.
[02:24:01.860 --> 02:24:08.963]  We spent seven months calling and begging and writing the White House and everything we could think of to do to ask him to honor his promises.
[02:24:09.683 --> 02:24:11.123]  And then we dropped our endorsement.
[02:24:11.163 --> 02:24:19.826]  Since that time, we're now tracking at least 10 critical immigration promises that Donald Trump has either unfulfilled or flat out broken or doing 180 degrees opposite
[02:24:21.827 --> 02:24:23.308]  From what we ask him to do.
[02:24:23.508 --> 02:24:42.261]  So, as you know, Alex, when you're in a position like me, where you're banned from Fox News and MSNBC and all the others, and we're still on Facebook and Twitter, but we're shadow banned or sandbagged, so when I have something to say without my blue checkmark, I'm lucky if a couple hundred people hear it, even though 600,000 people have joined our pages.
[02:24:43.262 --> 02:24:44.903]  We have to get a little sensational sometimes.
[02:24:44.963 --> 02:24:46.504]  We have to be very entertaining.
[02:24:47.024 --> 02:24:59.270]  And one of the entertaining, sensational things I've suggested is that Ann Coulter should consider running against Donald Trump in the 2020 primary because he is not listening to his base.
[02:24:59.530 --> 02:25:02.152]  He is not honoring his campaign promises on immigration.
[02:25:02.572 --> 02:25:10.636]  And I think that Ann Coulter, who's as imperfect as any of us, you know, I was not a fan of her support for Mitt Romney at one point.
[02:25:11.096 --> 02:25:16.798]  Or her closeness with Chris Christie, who are both amnesty-supporting globalists, in my opinion.
[02:25:18.198 --> 02:25:19.759]  You know, I think Coulter could shake him up.
[02:25:19.839 --> 02:25:26.921]  And, you know, I wouldn't make any money from the ratings, but can you imagine the ratings and the entertainment value on an Ann Coulter-Donald Trump debate?
[02:25:27.421 --> 02:25:32.943]  This would be something that... Well, it's obviously a great idea, and of course, you're the guy that had it.
[02:25:33.143 --> 02:25:33.763]  And I want to be clear.
[02:25:34.577 --> 02:25:49.682]  I was an earlier supporter of Trump, I think on getting us out of the TPP, and just saying that it's good to have a nation existing, and good to defend the Second Amendment, and so many things he's done in a lot of areas are really good, and to a lot better Supreme Court justice than Hillary, but at the same time...
[02:25:50.802 --> 02:26:06.894]  When he then lets the FBI run rampant and leaves these Democrats in place, and all these other things that are against his own interest, it's good to actually have a shot fired across his bow politically to let him know that his real base is getting very, very unhappy about what's happening.
[02:26:06.934 --> 02:26:11.157]  I've talked to big national talk show hosts, multiple ones that are very close friends with Trump.
[02:26:11.197 --> 02:26:12.218]  He talks to them almost every day.
[02:26:12.959 --> 02:26:15.461]  And, you know, Sean Hannity won't criticize the President.
[02:26:15.481 --> 02:26:16.842]  He trusts him, and I get that.
[02:26:17.162 --> 02:26:18.303]  And I think Hannity does a great job.
[02:26:19.346 --> 02:26:25.250]  Well some of the others have found that Trump only listens to them when they criticize him about what he's doing.
[02:26:26.090 --> 02:26:31.213]  And so I think this whole Hank Coulter idea is a good one overall.
[02:26:31.494 --> 02:26:35.036]  My issue is, I agree with you, I agree with you that
[02:26:37.242 --> 02:26:42.547]  Overall, he's not done a bunch of stuff he said he'd do on immigration yet that he could have with executive power, like declare an emergency and just do it.
[02:26:43.248 --> 02:26:50.594]  That said, though, Coulter criticizes the emergency that I was talking about, but instead says keep the government shut down, which hurts the economy.
[02:26:50.834 --> 02:26:54.378]  Why not just bypass Pelosi having power and declare the emergency that's in the Constitution?
[02:26:54.398 --> 02:27:03.045]  So, I disagree with Coulter on some things as well, so it doesn't mean I really don't want Trump to win re-election, but I think you're saying get Coulter to start talking about running to get Trump back on the straight and narrow?
[02:27:03.786 --> 02:27:14.212]  Well, even if she needs to run, I don't think that it would be harmful for us to have a healthy GOP primary based on the issues and hold Trump accountable.
[02:27:14.232 --> 02:27:18.214]  And there's a wide variation of people who do and do not support what I'm doing right now.
[02:27:19.475 --> 02:27:21.996]  Me personally, I will never vote for Donald Trump again.
[02:27:22.256 --> 02:27:26.479]  I don't care if he's running against the socialists, Oscar Cortez, or whatever her name is.
[02:27:27.359 --> 02:27:30.303]  I can't vote for him again because I feel very betrayed.
[02:27:30.484 --> 02:27:42.380]  So it felt great during the campaign and at the inauguration to hear things that I've been saying for years echoing off the walls of the White House and to have some hope that that was going to take place.
[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:57.372]  At this point in the battle to save this country from amnesty legislation, I mean, most of the country and maybe a lot of people listening right now would be shocked to know that there was an amnesty embedded in legislation that failed thanks to the Democrats last week that would have pushed us beyond the point of no return.
[02:27:57.392 --> 02:28:01.776]  It would have given an amnesty to over 1 million DACA and TPS illegal immigrants.
[02:28:02.516 --> 02:28:04.498]  And, oh, everybody said, oh, it was a temporary thing.
[02:28:04.518 --> 02:28:08.561]  Listen, folks, there's nothing temporary about temporary protective statuses, okay?
[02:28:08.581 --> 02:28:12.123]  I've never seen one canceled in the last 20, 30 years, okay?
[02:28:12.563 --> 02:28:17.327]  And what Trump tried to do was take... Yeah, but what about the argument he did where he said, okay, on the Second Amendment, have whatever you want.
[02:28:17.347 --> 02:28:18.347]  They said, ban all guns.
[02:28:18.768 --> 02:28:19.568]  Blew up in their face.
[02:28:19.848 --> 02:28:21.730]  He did this with DACA and stuff a year and a half ago.
[02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:23.491]  They said, we want everything, no borders.
[02:28:23.791 --> 02:28:27.354]  And I think he does that as a tactic, knowing that it's not going to be reasonable.
[02:28:28.208 --> 02:28:33.830]  Well, a lot of people say that, and a lot of people say that this is all part of Trump's big game plan and things like that.
[02:28:33.850 --> 02:28:39.791]  But look, folks, he's the President of the United States, and these are things he's saying directly from the Oval Office.
[02:28:40.111 --> 02:28:46.233]  The President of the United States has endorsed and is supporting amnesty bills that would destroy the border forevermore.
[02:28:46.573 --> 02:28:54.415]  And they, thank God, there are enough Americans who have been willing to stand up and push back and fight against those bills to stop them, because many people don't want to believe it or know what's going on.
[02:28:54.435 --> 02:28:55.055]  Well, sir, I'll say this.
[02:28:55.075 --> 02:28:56.976]  I mean, first a full wall, now a smaller wall.
[02:28:57.976 --> 02:29:13.482]  The wall is secondary to kicking people out that are here illegally.
[02:29:13.502 --> 02:29:19.685]  I recently saw a Gillette ad owned by Procter & Gamble.
[02:29:20.825 --> 02:29:21.906]  But it's been a minute and a half.
[02:29:23.064 --> 02:29:25.105]  Showing men as the enemy.
[02:29:25.726 --> 02:29:28.388]  That if a man tries to talk to a beautiful woman, he's a bad guy.
[02:29:28.468 --> 02:29:33.151]  Or if two kids get in a fight, somehow just men fighting, period, is evil.
[02:29:35.132 --> 02:29:48.221]  When you look at the Romans conquering civilizations where they would kill all the men, or you look at black slaves with the women being kept as the house service to suppress the men, you know that any authoritarian society seeking to dominate wants to suppress the men.
[02:29:49.522 --> 02:29:52.584]  Then you read the white papers, the Globalist, that's exactly what they're doing.
[02:29:54.346 --> 02:30:04.334]  So men have now learned that this has happened, and there are chemicals added to the water, added to the food, trying to suppress their normal drive, their normal ethos, who they are.
[02:30:05.675 --> 02:30:11.559]  And that's why online, herbs and supplements known to boost libido, stamina, and energy are such best sellers.
[02:30:11.599 --> 02:30:13.661]  That's why I'm getting into that market.
[02:30:14.935 --> 02:30:23.482]  Six, seven years ago, as a producer, went out and found the most powerful formulas out there to not just give men, but also women, a boost.
[02:30:24.022 --> 02:30:26.364]  Super male, super female vitality.
[02:30:26.764 --> 02:30:35.811]  No one else produces a herbal formula that's cold-pressed and then aged like this group does in Utah.
[02:30:36.772 --> 02:30:41.896]  And they've had so much trouble getting the wild-sourced herbs that I'm having to discontinue them.
[02:30:42.878 --> 02:30:45.640]  Now they've said maybe in a year, maybe in two, they can bring it back.
[02:30:45.700 --> 02:30:50.004]  But right now, this is the last run of Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[02:30:50.044 --> 02:30:50.524]  It's 50% off.
[02:30:50.604 --> 02:30:56.228]  Even though it's selling out, I want you to experience what God gave us through nature.
[02:30:56.288 --> 02:30:59.631]  But regardless, if you're depressed, go out and go for a hike.
[02:31:00.452 --> 02:31:03.954]  If you feel like you're a loser, you know, go out and help people at a soup kitchen.
[02:31:04.775 --> 02:31:07.978]  Because all the studies show, giving is better than receiving.
[02:31:08.806 --> 02:31:11.069]  You've given to us in incredible ways at Infowars.
[02:31:11.109 --> 02:31:16.575]  You've supported us, you've been demonized for us, you've bought our products, and you've been fulfilled by it.
[02:31:16.615 --> 02:31:17.496]  You've seen great results.
[02:31:17.776 --> 02:31:18.717]  And I thank you for that.
[02:31:19.818 --> 02:31:23.703]  But when I bring out a product, I want to make sure it's the very best I can for you at the very best price.
[02:31:23.983 --> 02:31:28.408]  Because I appreciate what you're doing, and I believe in the golden rule, do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.
[02:31:29.409 --> 02:31:30.030]  So I salute you.
[02:31:30.050 --> 02:31:30.551]  I thank you.
[02:31:30.571 --> 02:31:34.876]  I just want to encourage you to get the last run in the foreseeable future.
[02:31:35.096 --> 02:31:38.901]  Hopefully it comes back of super male vitality and super female vitality.
[02:31:39.522 --> 02:31:40.082]  You know, it's funny.
[02:31:40.102 --> 02:31:41.624]  The price went up and up and up for it.
[02:31:42.485 --> 02:31:46.150]  It is a great formula and a bestseller with 4,000 plus five-star reviews.
[02:31:47.251 --> 02:31:53.352]  Well, for the last year, I couldn't get resupplied, and I said, I'm not going to buy it for the last six months, and now we're in discussions.
[02:31:53.392 --> 02:32:02.574]  Maybe the herbs can be gotten, and it is hard, but the point is, is that I'm giving you such a low price that what I'm selling it to you for becomes cost prohibitive to bring you something like this.
[02:32:03.154 --> 02:32:08.196]  We brought out powdered versions that are even stronger, but are powdered and organic, but not cold-pressed.
[02:32:08.576 --> 02:32:09.736]  People like them, but not as much.
[02:32:10.296 --> 02:32:13.177]  Because there's something about super male and super female vitality.
[02:32:13.197 --> 02:32:18.458]  So get the last available bottles at EnforcedStore.com or call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[02:32:21.619 --> 02:32:22.539]  We're proud of what we've done.
[02:32:22.559 --> 02:32:24.480]  I know I'm under scrutiny.

[02:32:32.121 --> 02:32:34.222]  EnforcedLife.com takes you right to the supplements.
[02:32:34.502 --> 02:32:38.886]  We're proud of what we brought you and the whole family of InfoWars products, but without you, we won't be here.
[02:32:39.066 --> 02:32:46.213]  So, be part of history, get a t-shirt, get a book, get some of the supplements that know you're funding the second American Revolution that's going worldwide.
[02:32:46.893 --> 02:32:51.477]  Super male and super female vitality, 50% off for a limited time at infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:51.597 --> 02:32:51.998]  Thank you all.
[02:33:06.363 --> 02:33:10.445]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:20.031 --> 02:33:26.655]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[02:33:31.243 --> 02:33:36.387]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:56.690 --> 02:33:59.593]  I like the idea of getting other people to run the Republican primary.
[02:34:00.254 --> 02:34:04.858]  That would certainly make her look more extreme than Trump and probably get him even more votes.
[02:34:04.899 --> 02:34:06.560]  Maybe Ann Coulter would get elected.
[02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:09.103]  That would be crazy.
[02:34:09.443 --> 02:34:12.687]  I know this, the globalists want Trump out because he's actually trying to be president.
[02:34:13.668 --> 02:34:16.931]  And I understand the lesser of two evil arguments is a fallacy.
[02:34:18.379 --> 02:34:31.024]  William, when you talk about Alexandria Cortez, and you talk about Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren, you talk about Kamala Harris saying no borders, period, and all of this.
[02:34:31.044 --> 02:34:34.746]  I mean, I get your point about Trump compromising with them.
[02:34:35.586 --> 02:34:42.229]  I just couldn't imagine not voting and supporting Trump over somebody like Pocahontas.
[02:34:46.693 --> 02:34:47.253]  All immediately.
[02:34:47.273 --> 02:34:47.994]  It takes a while.
[02:34:48.034 --> 02:34:50.355]  The nation of America is sort of strong like that.
[02:34:50.735 --> 02:34:52.136]  We could be mortally wounded already.
[02:34:52.196 --> 02:34:53.697]  We could be beyond the point of no return.
[02:34:53.717 --> 02:35:07.784]  There's a good chance that enough illegal immigrants combined with Muslim refugee resettlement programs and others have now already taken us beyond the numeric point of no return and that anyone promising the things that Donald Trump promised us could never be elected president again.
[02:35:07.804 --> 02:35:13.667]  Now, I don't know if we're past that invisible point yet or not, but we've got to be close to it because everybody saw how close
[02:35:14.287 --> 02:35:14.887]  Trump came.
[02:35:15.448 --> 02:35:22.852]  Well, the bill that Trump endorsed last week would have eventually displaced one million Trump voters, okay?
[02:35:23.272 --> 02:35:38.241]  One million illegal immigrants would have been on a path to eventual citizenship where they would vote Democrat, and we know they vote Democrat because of surveys, polling data, what the 1986 amnesty did to turn Republican State of California permanent socialist blue,
[02:35:39.163 --> 02:35:45.484]  If that bill passes or the current bill being pushed by nepotism son-in-law Jared Kushner,
[02:35:46.725 --> 02:36:00.274]  Who, if anybody would like to write to Jared Kushner and say, please don't continue supporting amnesty deals with Donald Trump, you can write him at, I think it's what, 666 Manhattan Avenue is where his real estate empire and offices are located.
[02:36:01.255 --> 02:36:08.419]  Kushner is on point now offering 1.8 million green cards, which means a path to citizenship, permanent legal status.
[02:36:08.940 --> 02:36:12.502]  The DACA, illegal aliens, DACA is an amnesty.
[02:36:12.822 --> 02:36:19.648]  So when Trump says it's not an amnesty, it's a temporary three-year continuation of DACA, it's an amnesty.
[02:36:19.728 --> 02:36:23.411]  And he's not being very straightforward or honest with us.
[02:36:23.431 --> 02:36:36.943]  And there are a lot of people that have heard so many lies that even when I come along, and representing the people who've been fighting in the trenches to stop amnesty for over a decade before Trump became a Johnny-come-lately to these issues, who had, Trump had no credibility on these issues.
[02:36:36.983 --> 02:36:39.826]  He gained his credibility through the support of people like you,
[02:36:40.286 --> 02:36:48.509]  And me, and Ann Coulter, and Jeff Sessions, and Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who were so thankful to have someone champion our causes.
[02:36:48.589 --> 02:36:56.592]  But here's the list, the tracking list, of where Trump is at on immigration issues based on our volunteer researchers at alipac.us.
[02:36:57.973 --> 02:37:01.675]  Trump promised that the caravan illegals could not come into the USA.
[02:37:01.795 --> 02:37:09.778]  We're going to be putting out an article in about 48 hours showing that most of the caravan illegal aliens have been allowed into the United States, and that's why more caravans are forming.
[02:37:10.558 --> 02:37:11.839]  Trump promised a border wall.
[02:37:11.879 --> 02:37:17.801]  There's no wall, and now he's talking about partial fencing in some places instead of a wall.
[02:37:18.722 --> 02:37:21.844]  Trump promised to end DACA amnesty on his first day in office.
[02:37:21.864 --> 02:37:32.772]  He continued the DACA for over a year, breaking his promise, before any liberal judge, which, once again, I heard you talking earlier, Alex, about how the president doesn't have to listen to one judge beneath the Supreme Court on these things.
[02:37:33.252 --> 02:37:34.273]  I completely agree.
[02:37:34.793 --> 02:37:46.880]  But now that a judge has given him cover on the DACA, he did not end DACA, and he seeks to make DACA permanent and take it from an unconstitutional Obama directive in memos to a formal law.
[02:37:47.020 --> 02:37:51.282]  And I can tell you, we did not elect Donald Trump to make DACA permanent.
[02:37:51.442 --> 02:37:56.765]  We elected Donald Trump because he promised us illegal immigrants, including DACA dreamers, had to leave the country.
[02:37:57.426 --> 02:38:00.029]  Everyone should remember this when he told us this.
[02:38:00.069 --> 02:38:02.733]  He said we either have a country or we don't.
[02:38:02.974 --> 02:38:04.596]  He told us the illegals had to leave.
[02:38:04.897 --> 02:38:07.240]  He told us he was going to form a deportation force.
[02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:08.902]  He's doing none of these things.
[02:38:09.163 --> 02:38:11.086]  He's actually doing something 180 degrees different than that.
[02:38:13.408 --> 02:38:24.434]  He promised us recently, read me just before the midterm elections, where a lot of voters like me did not get excited about things, that he was going to end birthright citizenship through an executive order.
[02:38:24.834 --> 02:38:25.434]  Didn't do it.
[02:38:25.694 --> 02:38:29.316]  He told us recently he was going to declare a state of emergency to get the wall built.
[02:38:29.636 --> 02:38:30.257]  Didn't do it.
[02:38:30.637 --> 02:38:33.518]  He told us he was sending the military to help deal with the invasion.
[02:38:33.578 --> 02:38:36.800]  They were down there flipping burgers and stringing up some wire and standing back.
[02:38:37.961 --> 02:38:40.582]  Trump promised to end capture and release of illegal aliens.
[02:38:40.942 --> 02:38:49.187]  The catch and release continues and Patriots on the ground in Arizona are doing live videos showing the DHS buses, our tax money, paying for the gas, paying for the drivers.
[02:38:49.467 --> 02:38:54.931]  Our tax money is busing illegal aliens into the country and turning them free.
[02:38:54.951 --> 02:39:09.100]  And there's a pattern here that we see Trump shout something out or his administration will do something that will catch the ire of the opposition, as you and I often do, and Trump will say, I'll give a new
[02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:16.466]  The asylum-seeking illegals must be returned to Mexico and next week we're going to start sending them back at 20 per day.
[02:39:16.526 --> 02:39:22.431]  And then the media goes, oh that horrible racist Donald Trump is going to start sending the asylum seekers back to Mexico.
[02:39:22.851 --> 02:39:25.433]  And then you find out, no, Mexico never agreed to this.
[02:39:25.493 --> 02:39:27.214]  Nobody's really going back to Mexico.
[02:39:27.274 --> 02:39:29.076]  But everybody heard the initial shouting.
[02:39:29.496 --> 02:39:31.218]  So there's so many people hearing this right now.
[02:39:31.238 --> 02:39:34.981]  Well he follows it up and says we're going to try to cut funding to Mexico because they're not doing it.
[02:39:35.561 --> 02:39:41.078]  You know, a lot of it is that Trump is surrounded by a bunch of people that are from the swamp who don't carry out what he says.
[02:39:41.659 --> 02:39:42.542]  They brag about it.
[02:39:43.482 --> 02:39:51.509]  Yeah, he hired a lot of globalist and open borders people and stuck him at DHS and all around him and ignored people like Sheriff Joe Arpaio and the people who got him elected.
[02:39:51.549 --> 02:39:55.272]  He didn't put his base in place and, you know, we're over two years in now.
[02:39:55.352 --> 02:39:59.536]  So I'm asking people to support what we're doing for several reasons here.
[02:39:59.676 --> 02:40:06.702]  Alex, one, if you like the idea of running in culture to try to get Donald Trump to return to his campaign promises, then we'd like your support.
[02:40:07.122 --> 02:40:09.004]  If you want to help stop amnesty bills,
[02:40:09.324 --> 02:40:12.967]  Which will neutralize millions of you listening out there in future U.S.
[02:40:13.007 --> 02:40:13.468]  elections.
[02:40:13.588 --> 02:40:24.697]  If you realize that you cannot compete against 2 to 3 or 4 million, I think the amnesty bills that Donald Trump endorsed that we fought to stop would have given amnesty to 4 million illegal aliens.
[02:40:24.837 --> 02:40:29.020]  So that's 4 million Trump voters thrown under the bus permanently in future U.S.
[02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:32.463]  elections, which would give Democrats a permanent monopoly over U.S.
[02:40:32.483 --> 02:40:34.225]  elections, government, and laws.
[02:40:34.835 --> 02:40:45.106]  The amnesty legislation that Ali Pak is fighting to stop will eventually, might take five years, 10 or 15 at max, will give Democrats a permanent monopoly over U.S.
[02:40:45.167 --> 02:40:46.908]  elections, government, and laws.
[02:40:47.309 --> 02:40:56.099]  And there's no way that you can beat these identity politics, anti-white, racist, socialist agendas with some type of rational
[02:40:56.999 --> 02:41:00.282]  Uh, appeal that's going to change the outcome of elections anymore.
[02:41:00.582 --> 02:41:02.723]  They're taking us beyond that point of no return.
[02:41:02.823 --> 02:41:06.125]  And at this point, that's where Trump is headed and we're trying to stop.
[02:41:06.185 --> 02:41:08.847]  So if you oppose the amnesty, we need your support.
[02:41:09.067 --> 02:41:26.139]  And even if you want to see Donald Trump reelected in 2020, we're asking for your support because you need to realize whether I'm here telling you this or not, whether you want to think about this or not, there are millions of Americans like me that supported Donald Trump fervently and endorsed him and voted for him.
[02:41:26.899 --> 02:41:29.562]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[02:41:29.582 --> 02:41:30.764]  I mean, here's the bottom line.
[02:41:31.665 --> 02:41:37.751]  We're getting from these socialist collapsed countries the very worst, dumbest people who want a free handout.
[02:41:37.771 --> 02:41:39.052]  They admit that, on average.
[02:41:39.850 --> 02:41:48.193]  And so when they do vote, they do almost overwhelmingly vote Democrat, especially the Islamicists being brought in, who are all under the control of their Imams, who they can put in these factories.
[02:41:48.694 --> 02:41:54.476]  I mean, this is really, really scary, this giant permanent third-world population being brought in that'll then be voting.
[02:41:55.016 --> 02:41:56.677]  So I get what you're saying overall.
[02:41:57.317 --> 02:42:00.458]  And the bigger question is, why is Trump doing this?
[02:42:00.478 --> 02:42:01.439]  I mean, I'm all for the wall.
[02:42:02.179 --> 02:42:05.301]  But it becomes a distraction from not allowing the amnesty.
[02:42:05.321 --> 02:42:08.504]  Because every time you do an amnesty, it just encourages the next group to come.
[02:42:08.544 --> 02:42:10.345]  And you know, Ronald Reagan found that out.
[02:42:10.385 --> 02:42:11.586]  You're absolutely right.
[02:42:11.926 --> 02:42:17.470]  You know, if most of these folks didn't vote to take the guns and go along with the leftist ideology, then I wouldn't care if America
[02:42:18.391 --> 02:42:18.872]  Turn brown.
[02:42:19.272 --> 02:42:22.316]  The problem is they're coming from countries that people believe in socialism.
[02:42:22.336 --> 02:42:23.277]  It's why they're hell holes.
[02:42:23.938 --> 02:42:25.720]  And it's a very, very sad thing.
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:26.761]  So we'll continue to track this.
[02:42:27.061 --> 02:42:28.183]  Get you back up in the next few weeks.
[02:42:28.243 --> 02:42:29.304]  Welcome to Come on the War Room.
[02:42:29.604 --> 02:42:30.666]  On the David Knight Show with others.
[02:42:31.346 --> 02:42:31.787]  Mr. Keene.
[02:42:31.847 --> 02:42:32.848]  And break all this down.
[02:42:33.169 --> 02:42:34.030]  Alipac.us.
[02:42:34.050 --> 02:42:35.511]  I'm Alex Jones with M4Wars.com.
[02:42:35.551 --> 02:42:35.812]  Thank you.
[02:42:38.100 --> 02:42:39.342]  We'll be right back after this break.
[02:42:39.502 --> 02:42:40.803]  I promise to finish up your phone calls.
[02:42:41.464 --> 02:42:43.226]  We've got... Watson was doing this Saturday.
[02:42:43.246 --> 02:42:44.167]  He was doing a TV interview.
[02:42:44.908 --> 02:42:46.030]  He's hosting 4th Hour Thursday.
[02:42:46.110 --> 02:42:47.631]  It's between Matt Brackett and 4th Hour.
[02:42:47.651 --> 02:42:48.573]  I'm going to take a few segments.
[02:42:49.113 --> 02:42:50.935]  This is a segment or two to finish up your phone calls.
[02:42:50.975 --> 02:42:52.217]  So we're going right to your calls.
[02:42:52.237 --> 02:42:53.158]  We're going to have a quick break.
[02:42:53.178 --> 02:42:53.739]  Please stay with us.
[02:43:02.788 --> 02:43:08.632]  Scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[02:43:09.012 --> 02:43:11.614]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[02:43:12.234 --> 02:43:15.676]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:43:15.937 --> 02:43:20.199]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:43:20.640 --> 02:43:23.882]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:43:24.802 --> 02:43:35.028]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:43:35.788 --> 02:43:44.333]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[02:43:45.974 --> 02:43:54.499]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[02:44:05.694 --> 02:44:13.556]  You've got Alexandra Cortez coming out saying CBS is racist and bad because they didn't send a black reporter to cover her for Congress.
[02:44:13.736 --> 02:44:15.737]  But she says, better get better next time.
[02:44:15.817 --> 02:44:19.738]  That's why to counter her, to get back in her face whenever she said that Don Jr.
[02:44:19.818 --> 02:44:23.639]  might face prison time for making the point that, you know, she loves Venezuela so much.
[02:44:23.759 --> 02:44:25.159]  In Venezuela, they eat their dogs.
[02:44:25.299 --> 02:44:27.900]  In capitalist countries like America, we walk our dogs.
[02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:33.264]  So, I came up with the idea for this little baby, and we have this as a limited edition, but I want it to be a bestseller.
[02:44:33.384 --> 02:44:34.585]  This is the first limited edition.
[02:44:34.605 --> 02:44:35.726]  We have another design coming out.
[02:44:36.026 --> 02:44:38.889]  There's only a few thousand of these, but we want this to be a huge seller.
[02:44:39.149 --> 02:44:43.052]  We want to put 50,000, 100,000 out of these like we've done Hillary for President.
[02:44:43.692 --> 02:44:47.535]  And it says, Capitalists walk their dogs, Socialists eat them.
[02:44:48.296 --> 02:44:52.659]  Then it's got an American flag that's very triggering to her, saying InfoWars.com.
[02:44:53.280 --> 02:44:54.000]  So there it is.
[02:44:55.151 --> 02:44:57.412]  It is on InfoWars.com.
[02:44:58.052 --> 02:45:00.654]  There's links to it on InfoWars.com.
[02:45:01.054 --> 02:45:02.154]  It's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:45:02.255 --> 02:45:03.555]  Capitalists walk their dogs.
[02:45:03.615 --> 02:45:04.616]  Socialists eat them.
[02:45:04.776 --> 02:45:05.016]  Sure.
[02:45:05.096 --> 02:45:06.016]  This is triggering.
[02:45:06.156 --> 02:45:07.157]  This is powerful.
[02:45:07.297 --> 02:45:15.621]  And it shows her with an enlarged cartoon head with giant ears looking like a dog thumbing at the mouth because that's what she looks like is a dog on methamphetamine.
[02:45:15.761 --> 02:45:17.222]  She's probably on methamphetamine.
[02:45:17.242 --> 02:45:18.022]  I mean, what is she on?
[02:45:18.042 --> 02:45:18.863]  We should ask the question.
[02:45:18.883 --> 02:45:19.663]  She used to be good-looking.
[02:45:19.683 --> 02:45:21.564]  She's lost so much weight and has meth mouth.
[02:45:21.744 --> 02:45:24.185]  So you could call it the Alexandra Cortez meth mouth.
[02:45:24.365 --> 02:45:31.849]  Because she dares to threaten people with jail time and subpoenas if they make fun of the fact that capitalists walk their dogs, socialists eat them.
[02:45:31.989 --> 02:45:35.070]  And she looks meth, you know, out of her brain now.
[02:45:35.110 --> 02:45:37.432]  Like she's flying on planet Pop-Tart.
[02:45:37.532 --> 02:45:39.773]  And so, get the hottest shirt on the internet.
[02:45:39.813 --> 02:45:40.633]  We know it's gonna be the hottest.
[02:45:40.673 --> 02:45:43.474]  No reviews yet because we're just launching it in the last few days.
[02:45:43.655 --> 02:45:46.576]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:45:48.797 --> 02:45:49.758]  Listen, we need your support.
[02:45:49.778 --> 02:45:51.679]  We want these to blow off the shelf.
[02:45:51.819 --> 02:45:52.779]  I want to reorder them.
[02:45:52.859 --> 02:45:55.181]  We're going to have a slightly different design each time.
[02:45:55.281 --> 02:45:59.964]  I want to have 10 different limited editions shell out in the next six months of this.
[02:46:00.064 --> 02:46:04.066]  And I want this everywhere, because she's the new symbol of the Democratic Party.
[02:46:04.627 --> 02:46:08.089]  And it points out, capitalists walk their dogs, socialists eat them.
[02:46:08.429 --> 02:46:11.431]  And when people say, man, well, why are you showing her as a dog?
[02:46:11.671 --> 02:46:13.372]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, in the final
[02:46:13.652 --> 02:46:14.753]  Equation of communism.
[02:46:14.873 --> 02:46:17.154]  People eat people and are made lower than dogs.
[02:46:17.274 --> 02:46:21.536]  And she is an absolute tyrant wanting to arrest people that make fun of her.
[02:46:21.696 --> 02:46:25.438]  And so we're going to show her how America works and throw it back in her face.
[02:46:25.518 --> 02:46:28.979]  Because her dancing a few years ago, she was good looking and looked healthy.
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:30.640]  What drugs are she on?
[02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:31.601]  We need an intervention.
[02:46:32.301 --> 02:46:33.081]  Methamphetamine?
[02:46:33.101 --> 02:46:35.002]  Or is it Adderall?
[02:46:35.262 --> 02:46:36.183]  What is she snorting?
[02:46:36.523 --> 02:46:38.304]  We need to help Alexandra Cortez.
[02:46:38.504 --> 02:46:39.164]  Get the t-shirt.
[02:46:39.344 --> 02:46:40.285]  Infomercial.com.
[02:46:40.405 --> 02:46:40.665]  Do it!
[02:47:05.783 --> 02:47:08.348]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:34.524 --> 02:47:36.306]  Okay, we had a guest on for two segments.
[02:47:36.326 --> 02:47:55.466]  We're going back to your calls now, and I asked Josh in Arizona to hold because he talked about the WikiLeaks, which talks about children in hot tubs and $64,000, $5,000 of hot dogs for Obama and cheese pizza and the kids will be ready for your pleasure and Aleister Crowley rituals and blood and semen.
[02:47:55.486 --> 02:47:56.407]  I mean, it's devil worship.
[02:47:57.580 --> 02:48:10.933]  And it's the Podestas and one of the Podesta brothers in the Washington Post in 2007 saying I have a basement that I watch, you know, deviant movies in and he has pictures of naked kids all over his house in sexual poses.
[02:48:12.694 --> 02:48:13.955]  It's all in plain view of these people.
[02:48:13.996 --> 02:48:19.481]  They're just putting it in our face and they want a system where we can't do anything to stop them.
[02:48:20.506 --> 02:48:21.666]  That's like Bill Maher.
[02:48:21.686 --> 02:48:24.327]  The name of his production company is, uh, Kid Love.
[02:48:25.328 --> 02:48:27.848]  Which is, you know, is an amble slogan, basically.
[02:48:27.868 --> 02:48:30.149]  And he makes jokes about having sex with kids all the time.
[02:48:31.550 --> 02:48:36.451]  And says it's okay to have sex with, you know, kids that have sex with 35 year olds when they're 12.
[02:48:36.911 --> 02:48:41.213]  Just incredibly outrageous, evil, pathetic stuff of these soulless demons.
[02:48:42.934 --> 02:48:43.934]  Like Bill Maher.
[02:48:44.834 --> 02:48:47.095]  But, uh, Josh was saying he had a theory.
[02:48:48.814 --> 02:48:53.135]  Dealing with what walnut sauce is, and are you going to say it's the pituitary gland?
[02:48:53.155 --> 02:49:15.122]  Because they confirmed that Jimmy Savelle and others would torture little kids to death, but if they couldn't get regular ones to kill, if everything was to grab a kid and run over them with a car so they could say, oh, there's a police report, they got run over, but they would hurry to the morgue, and they work with different government-controlled morgues and eat the pituitary gland as quickly as possible and get high off of it.
[02:49:15.162 --> 02:49:15.622]  So, yes.
[02:49:16.362 --> 02:49:18.343]  Is that what you were going to say walnut sauce is, Josh?
[02:49:19.796 --> 02:49:21.357]  Well, Alex, yeah.
[02:49:22.597 --> 02:49:34.801]  Essentially, it's a so if you if you search engine, uh, adrenal cortex transverse, that's a transverse bisection of the adrenal cortex.
[02:49:35.761 --> 02:49:39.922]  Uh, it looks strikingly similar to a walnut.
[02:49:40.502 --> 02:49:40.842]  Okay?
[02:49:41.283 --> 02:49:46.104]  And we all know that the say that in layman's terms, you're saying if you turn it inside out.
[02:49:47.204 --> 02:49:48.805]  Well, no, if you just cut it in half.
[02:49:49.145 --> 02:49:49.325]  Yeah.
[02:49:50.690 --> 02:49:58.715]  The color, the shape, the convolutions, the contouring.
[02:49:59.215 --> 02:50:05.439]  Are you saying somebody that says in his emails he's in Aleister Crowley rituals, they say we'll have the blood, the urine, the breast milk for you?
[02:50:06.319 --> 02:50:09.061]  Are you saying that somebody like that would actually be eating pituitary glands?
[02:50:11.062 --> 02:50:12.643]  It came out in the Associated Press.
[02:50:13.564 --> 02:50:23.048]  That Al Gore, not in case he got shot, he carried around a refrigerator full of blood that he didn't just inject, he drank it.
[02:50:23.628 --> 02:50:29.131]  And by the way, it's in the news today, I have an article here, where there's these companies coming out everywhere where you get young people's blood.
[02:50:29.989 --> 02:50:32.470]  Oh, and if the kids volunteer, they have rights now.
[02:50:32.510 --> 02:50:33.450]  They can be emancipated.
[02:50:33.790 --> 02:50:35.130]  They can go give blood on their tin.
[02:50:35.770 --> 02:50:39.271]  California says you can take a vaccine when you're ten, or another one have sex when you're ten.
[02:50:39.651 --> 02:50:44.952]  That's why they want this so kids can start, again, being paid to have their blood taken by these people.
[02:50:45.272 --> 02:50:46.092]  That's in the news today.
[02:50:46.112 --> 02:50:46.532]  Can you believe it?
[02:50:47.773 --> 02:50:48.593]  It's vampirism.
[02:50:49.333 --> 02:50:50.333]  Absolutely, I believe it.
[02:50:55.572 --> 02:51:07.802]  Jan Irving last week touched on this with the Adrenochrome reference, and that's a favorite cocktail among devil worshipers.
[02:51:07.862 --> 02:51:17.931]  And if you look at the Podesta emails, Alex, you'll see that the walnut sauce was, you know, what was being served during
[02:51:18.484 --> 02:51:25.970]  They're sort of a brainstorming session in terms of Hillary fundraising and campaigning.
[02:51:26.530 --> 02:51:27.631]  Yes, they're going to have a fundraiser.
[02:51:27.651 --> 02:51:28.772]  They're going to have walnut sauce.
[02:51:28.792 --> 02:51:28.992]  Yep.
[02:51:29.532 --> 02:51:30.253]  Well, yeah, yeah.
[02:51:30.273 --> 02:51:33.235]  But adrenochrome is, you know, it's epinephrine.
[02:51:33.375 --> 02:51:39.880]  It's an oxidized version of adrenaline that you can consume and it gets you amped.
[02:51:41.263 --> 02:51:42.324]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:51:42.944 --> 02:51:45.426]  Bottom line, sir, these people are into all of that, okay?
[02:51:46.367 --> 02:51:52.090]  And just, you look at John Podesta, he looks like a demonic vampire ghoul.
[02:51:52.130 --> 02:51:53.171]  He even has vampire teeth.
[02:51:54.632 --> 02:51:57.394]  And he's just, these are the worst people.
[02:51:57.734 --> 02:51:59.675]  Who do you think Hillary wants to work for?
[02:52:00.756 --> 02:52:03.618]  Ugly, demonic, twisted, stinking people.
[02:52:04.398 --> 02:52:06.500]  Because she's a stinking, demonic monster.
[02:52:07.600 --> 02:52:08.821]  They got one thing on their mind.
[02:52:09.762 --> 02:52:10.162]  One thing.
[02:52:11.735 --> 02:52:12.735]  And you know what that is.
[02:52:13.956 --> 02:52:14.596]  And they're coming.
[02:52:16.036 --> 02:52:17.517]  They're coming for everything you got.
[02:52:19.877 --> 02:52:21.638]  Anthony in New Hampshire, you're on the air.
[02:52:21.658 --> 02:52:22.218]  Thanks for holding.
[02:52:22.298 --> 02:52:22.638]  Go ahead.
[02:52:24.098 --> 02:52:25.679]  Hey, Alex Jones.
[02:52:27.099 --> 02:52:27.459]  Hi, brother.
[02:52:27.479 --> 02:52:28.220]  Nice to meet you, man.
[02:52:28.660 --> 02:52:29.160]  Nice to meet you.
[02:52:30.200 --> 02:52:33.241]  So I'm just watching this like amazing Desmond kid.
[02:52:34.061 --> 02:52:36.722]  And I mean, I just don't know what to think.
[02:52:39.167 --> 02:52:48.096]  Oh, how NBC, ABC, CBS has him dancing half-naked everywhere in front of men throwing money at him and he talks about how he uses ketamine on TV and looks all drugged out and so cute.
[02:52:48.476 --> 02:52:48.837]  Yeah.
[02:52:49.738 --> 02:52:56.765]  Yeah, like, I mean, I'm 25 and I mean, I don't have any kids yet, but like, you know,
[02:52:57.392 --> 02:53:00.173]  Am I going to have to worry about, you know, that happening to my kids?
[02:53:00.313 --> 02:53:01.674]  That's really what I'm worried about.
[02:53:01.694 --> 02:53:07.936]  Yes, this is taught in the schools, and adults come, men come dressed as women, and then talk to your child about the sexual preference they have.
[02:53:08.457 --> 02:53:11.818]  If anyone else did this to you, you know, at a park, they go to jail.
[02:53:11.878 --> 02:53:19.181]  But as long as they go, I'm a drag queen, I'm going to talk to your five-year-old now about being a drag queen, it's like, oh, please do, how nice.
[02:53:19.821 --> 02:53:24.043]  Oh, and the kid hangs out with a known axe murderer and talks about using drugs with him on TV.
[02:53:24.804 --> 02:53:25.364]  It's so good.
[02:53:25.404 --> 02:53:25.604]  Yeah.
[02:53:27.011 --> 02:53:35.913]  Yeah, like, like, and then they're like telling like how, like, you know, how good parents they are.
[02:53:35.993 --> 02:53:38.294]  Meanwhile, neither one of them have any jobs.
[02:53:38.394 --> 02:53:45.895]  Well, of course, the mom and dad don't have a job, but their son, who's now a girl, since age five, he goes and dances at strip clubs.
[02:53:46.775 --> 02:53:47.496]  But it's okay.
[02:53:49.336 --> 02:53:52.257]  Yeah, because his dad looks like Brian Stelter or something.
[02:53:52.697 --> 02:53:53.277]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:53:54.266 --> 02:53:56.988]  They admitted this to the British News, and here almost all these kids are autistic.
[02:53:57.248 --> 02:53:57.869]  So they're victims.
[02:53:57.889 --> 02:53:58.930]  They don't know what's happening to them.
[02:53:59.910 --> 02:54:01.892]  And this is the sacrament of the left.
[02:54:02.092 --> 02:54:02.973]  This is their religion.
[02:54:04.154 --> 02:54:07.076]  The only time they have any energy is when they're stealing a child's future.
[02:54:07.636 --> 02:54:14.301]  Understand, when you aren't satanically controlled under that umbrella, these people have no energy, are never alive, unless they're doing bad.
[02:54:15.502 --> 02:54:15.863]  And so,
[02:54:17.827 --> 02:54:24.048]  People like Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, Adolf Hitler, they were only happy when they were doing bad things.
[02:54:25.549 --> 02:54:26.289]  And they talked about it.
[02:54:26.649 --> 02:54:42.532]  And I've interviewed some of the famous psychiatrists, they're the top psychiatrists and serial killers, and they'll talk about that in their books, that everything's like depression, and demons attacking them, and nightmares, and they're cold, and they're alone, but if they can just get a kid in the basement, and torture him and have him beg for mommy,
[02:54:44.199 --> 02:54:45.200]  They just feel alive.
[02:54:45.660 --> 02:54:47.801]  It's like beautiful Beethoven to them.
[02:54:48.061 --> 02:54:50.902]  You and I would kill ourselves if we had to listen to kids be tortured and couldn't help them.
[02:54:51.243 --> 02:54:53.364]  To them, it's the most beautiful thing in the world.
[02:54:53.384 --> 02:54:54.985]  They call it the beautiful music.
[02:54:55.405 --> 02:54:56.125]  I appreciate your call.
[02:54:56.145 --> 02:55:08.611]  And they just sit in dungeons with kids begging for mommy and they get them out and rape them and torture them and then they'll give them drugs to jack them back up and feed them and then shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,
[02:55:11.205 --> 02:55:14.849]  They gut them and drink their blood in a big satanic ritual and it's what they do.
[02:55:16.732 --> 02:55:18.433]  I mean, the Podestas, they never did anything wrong.
[02:55:18.453 --> 02:55:22.358]  They just funded the Arab Spring and mass murder over there and put Al-Qaeda and ISIS in charge.
[02:55:23.960 --> 02:55:24.740]  And so that's who they are.
[02:55:26.743 --> 02:55:28.425]  And the whole corporate media covers it up.
[02:55:29.606 --> 02:55:32.169]  I remember all that damning stuff in the Podesta emails was too powerful.
[02:55:33.806 --> 02:55:36.047]  New York City, other states, flying kids in.
[02:55:36.067 --> 02:55:38.108]  We'll have seven-year-olds in the hot tub ready for you.
[02:55:38.548 --> 02:55:40.249]  These are pretty well behaved, but they're still kids.
[02:55:40.469 --> 02:55:43.070]  They'll be there for your entertainment.
[02:55:43.090 --> 02:55:46.732]  $65,000 of hot dogs coming in, you know, for the pizza party.
[02:55:47.992 --> 02:55:50.053]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on and on.
[02:55:51.274 --> 02:55:54.055]  And what were they going to do when all that had come out?
[02:55:56.408 --> 02:55:57.209]  What were they going to do?
[02:55:57.229 --> 02:56:12.647]  Well, they just said Newsweek, Associated Press, Reuters, CNN, MSNBC, all point at a pizza place, and disinfo that it had a basement in it, and it was doing all the stuff that Podesta and others went to, to distract everything onto that, like the sin eater.
[02:56:13.499 --> 02:56:26.794]  And so everything became that, that it wasn't going on there, so we could ignore Lolita Express, and the airplanes, and the little kids, and the Clintons, and all the rape, and all the UN doing it, and Hillary's top people caught smuggling kids in and out of the country.
[02:56:27.275 --> 02:56:27.815]  It's incredible.
[02:56:27.835 --> 02:56:28.556]  We're gonna go to break.
[02:56:28.576 --> 02:56:29.197]  Come back with more calls.
[02:56:31.001 --> 02:56:35.263]  And then Matt Bragg is going to take over here very shortly, but just reaching out to all the listeners.
[02:56:36.263 --> 02:56:49.069]  When you call up and tell me how great I am, I appreciate you, but it kind of becomes an anachronism because you're the reason we're here, and I hate having to come to you and say, financially support us or we won't be here, but I'm literally in your hands.
[02:56:49.849 --> 02:56:51.370]  Now, I'm resisting.
[02:56:51.470 --> 02:56:52.250]  We're fighting them hard.
[02:56:52.890 --> 02:56:58.553]  You know supporting us that you've got people committed to go to the very end in this fight, but I really don't want the Globals to win.
[02:56:59.625 --> 02:57:08.052]  And we need to be funded massively, and it's so easy to do if you just go to mfullwhorestore.com and get the all-new Turbo Force.
[02:57:08.333 --> 02:57:11.295]  Get the Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:57:11.636 --> 02:57:15.539]  Get Survival Shield X3 now with all three types of iodine for the Deep Breath Crystal Source.
[02:57:15.799 --> 02:57:17.281]  That special 50% off is about to end.
[02:57:18.001 --> 02:57:19.763]  Super Bowl Vitality is the last run of it.
[02:57:19.783 --> 02:57:21.545]  We can't get the Wild Crafted Herbs anymore.
[02:57:21.585 --> 02:57:23.067]  We may be able to reformulate it on the road.
[02:57:23.147 --> 02:57:23.588]  I don't know.
[02:57:24.168 --> 02:57:25.510]  But the point is, this is the last run of that.
[02:57:25.950 --> 02:57:28.133]  Info at Worship4.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:57:28.153 --> 02:57:32.157]  Alright, we're going to come right back in just two minutes with more of your calls.
[02:57:32.978 --> 02:57:36.101]  And then Matt Bracken takes over to get into all the things that are happening.
[02:57:36.822 --> 02:57:37.503]  And so much more.
[02:57:38.223 --> 02:57:38.684]  Stay with us.
[02:57:39.164 --> 02:57:39.905]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:39.945 --> 02:57:40.566]  But just remember this.
[02:57:41.206 --> 02:57:44.990]  Regardless of what happens with Alex Jones or Trump or anybody else, you know the truth.
[02:57:45.511 --> 02:57:46.672]  You just keep moving forward.
[02:57:46.712 --> 02:57:47.633]  You keep warning people.
[02:57:47.893 --> 02:57:49.335]  You keep exposing these evil monsters.
[02:57:49.615 --> 02:57:50.616]  The children are counting on you.
[02:57:53.925 --> 02:57:54.886]  Now, you've stayed vigilant.
[02:57:54.926 --> 02:57:55.967]  You've been pushing the site.
[02:57:56.027 --> 02:57:57.209]  You've been helping us get it out there.
[02:57:57.309 --> 02:58:00.853]  But if you don't keep pushing, this is an ongoing fight we're going to lose.
[02:58:01.053 --> 02:58:04.156]  So please, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:04.276 --> 02:58:05.257]  Get that link out to everybody.
[02:58:05.358 --> 02:58:09.302]  And please remember InfoWarsStore.com, where we have the very best fish oil.
[02:58:09.482 --> 02:58:10.683]  We're good to go.
[02:58:35.674 --> 02:58:36.814]  Because we need border security.
[02:58:36.854 --> 02:58:37.575]  We have to have it.
[02:58:37.595 --> 02:58:39.795]  Should have happened 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago.
[02:58:59.440 --> 02:59:00.421]  And it's gonna happen now.
[02:59:00.901 --> 02:59:01.502]  Gonna happen now.
[02:59:01.542 --> 02:59:02.743]  Thank you very much, everybody.
[02:59:03.364 --> 02:59:04.725]  Enjoy your food.
[02:59:04.925 --> 02:59:11.050]  There's the juxtaposed of golden candlestick holders with candles and then all this fast food.
[02:59:11.091 --> 02:59:12.232]  Trump is ridiculous.
[02:59:12.712 --> 02:59:14.474]  He's the ultimate joker card.
[02:59:16.635 --> 02:59:20.419]  But meanwhile, he says we've got burgers stacked a mile high.
[02:59:20.719 --> 02:59:23.562]  They spit it that he's lying when it's a figure of speech.
[02:59:24.494 --> 02:59:30.076]  And I didn't see anybody complaining when Barack Obama was spending $65,000 on hot dog dinners.
[02:59:30.697 --> 02:59:39.040]  Nobody cared to mention that in the mainstream press or ridicule him, and Obama always made a big deal of going out for fast food, or the press did at least when he did.
[02:59:39.060 --> 02:59:39.560]  Oh, it's well known.
[02:59:39.600 --> 02:59:42.982]  Trump likes tacos, and Obama likes winners.
[02:59:56.181 --> 03:00:00.130]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:00:14.731 --> 03:00:18.452]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[03:00:18.792 --> 03:00:22.514]  Today, I'm trying to get to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:22.534 --> 03:00:26.255]  I'm trying to get to all your calls, but we can take 20 calls at a time, so we've got to load 20, 30 up.
[03:00:26.315 --> 03:00:28.636]  It's hard to get to everybody, but I'm trying here.
[03:00:29.196 --> 03:00:30.276]  Michael in Florida.
[03:00:30.296 --> 03:00:31.257]  Let's talk about censorship.
[03:00:31.277 --> 03:00:31.817]  You're on the air.
[03:00:31.857 --> 03:00:32.197]  Go ahead.
[03:00:33.318 --> 03:00:33.678]  Hey, Alex.
[03:00:33.798 --> 03:00:35.158]  I really appreciate you taking my call.
[03:00:35.178 --> 03:00:35.718]  Appreciate you.
[03:00:38.840 --> 03:00:43.963]  Just want to just want to say how much it means to me that the courage you have to do what you do every day.
[03:00:43.983 --> 03:00:46.665]  It's it helps me get through the day.
[03:00:47.105 --> 03:00:53.469]  And I was shocked when you were talking about your phone, taping your phone, the camera on your phone.
[03:00:53.509 --> 03:00:57.171]  I did that about a year ago, but it's a little consequence.
[03:00:57.971 --> 03:01:01.213]  I'm running two VPNs and encryption on my phone.
[03:01:01.273 --> 03:01:07.337]  And it's when I'm watching your show, it's amazing how when you get the key points that I'm sure nobody
[03:01:08.032 --> 03:01:09.815]  You know, the powers that be don't want anybody to hear.
[03:01:09.835 --> 03:01:12.721]  My phone's censored then.
[03:01:13.695 --> 03:01:14.695]  That's pretty shocking.
[03:01:14.795 --> 03:01:24.619]  Well they admit that they are in people's phones in live time and now they're going public that all the new phones and everything by next year, starting next month, they're phasing in with Microsoft.
[03:01:25.119 --> 03:01:33.122]  We'll have all these different agencies and private liberal groups through a thing called NewsGuard in your phone in live time tracking what you do.
[03:01:33.142 --> 03:01:34.663]  Notice they're introducing it to us.
[03:01:35.043 --> 03:01:39.984]  Oh there's a bug in iPhone where anybody can call you and just hit a button and listen to you in your house.
[03:01:42.446 --> 03:01:45.488]  Also, you know, these people call themselves socialists.
[03:01:45.508 --> 03:01:47.009]  They're not socialists, they're communists.
[03:01:47.309 --> 03:01:52.732]  They're no different than the same people that were behind the Red Army faction in Europe.
[03:01:53.613 --> 03:01:55.734]  I think it's about time to start calling them what they are.
[03:01:58.596 --> 03:02:07.762]  Well, what I've found is there's people that are just committed to evil, and these different evil groups work together, but, I mean, who do you think, I mean, I think if we say there's one evil group on the planet,
[03:02:08.727 --> 03:02:10.808]  Then that distracts from all the different evil groups that link up.
[03:02:10.828 --> 03:02:13.568]  There are certainly different groups that have proclivity for evil.
[03:02:14.509 --> 03:02:15.189]  I agree.
[03:02:15.469 --> 03:02:15.849]  I agree.
[03:02:17.709 --> 03:02:24.271]  Just know when the time comes, these people that are trying to dox you for your beliefs, whatever, don't be afraid of them.
[03:02:24.631 --> 03:02:28.032]  Just look at you and the courage you have to do what you do every day.
[03:02:28.312 --> 03:02:30.353]  I see the stress on your face when I'm watching.
[03:02:31.633 --> 03:02:34.854]  Just know God put you where you are for a reason.
[03:02:36.084 --> 03:02:38.106]  Well, I appreciate that, brother, but listen, I can't give up.
[03:02:38.126 --> 03:02:39.747]  I mean, they're going to destroy me one way or the other.
[03:02:39.767 --> 03:02:43.410]  I might as well make them fight for it and get as much done as I can to expose them in the process.
[03:02:44.111 --> 03:02:45.652]  I'm actually just just just tired.
[03:02:45.852 --> 03:02:48.555]  I'm just tired sometimes, but that's OK.
[03:02:49.015 --> 03:02:50.557]  I mean, I'm mad they don't do a better job, really.
[03:02:51.237 --> 03:02:52.698]  I mean, I know how to beat these people.
[03:02:53.079 --> 03:02:54.340]  And of course, our listeners do, too.
[03:02:54.380 --> 03:02:54.820]  God bless you.
[03:02:54.840 --> 03:02:55.301]  Thanks, Michael.
[03:02:55.921 --> 03:02:56.261]  OK.
[03:02:58.023 --> 03:02:58.884]  Joe in New York.
[03:02:59.926 --> 03:03:02.889]  Before I get to my point, I just want to say real quick,
[03:03:27.392 --> 03:03:31.634]  Big time hunter, and I'll tell you at four o'clock in the morning, nothing gets me ready to go out and hit the woods.
[03:03:31.654 --> 03:03:34.415]  Like a drop of Secret 12, a little Brain Force Plus.
[03:03:35.076 --> 03:03:36.176]  You guys need to try that stuff.
[03:03:36.216 --> 03:03:38.277]  Get out there and support the fight and do yourself some good.
[03:03:39.958 --> 03:03:40.818]  Thanks for the great product.
[03:03:40.878 --> 03:03:44.920]  I need to take some of that because I'm a little bit run down with allergies today, and I'm always like, wait, my own products are great.
[03:03:45.340 --> 03:03:47.361]  In fact, I should take some Brain Force Plus and some Secret 12.
[03:03:47.401 --> 03:03:48.202]  You're absolutely right.
[03:03:49.042 --> 03:03:49.522]  There you go.
[03:03:49.642 --> 03:03:53.364]  Well, hey, in my home state of Connecticut here, we're facing some
[03:03:54.062 --> 03:03:56.983]  Very tough economic times, which is causing taxes to go up.
[03:03:57.423 --> 03:03:59.544]  Businesses and people leaving the state in droves.
[03:04:00.124 --> 03:04:07.407]  One of the taxes they're introducing, or want to, hopefully this won't pass, is they want a 50% tax on your ammunition.
[03:04:08.848 --> 03:04:09.648]  No matter what it is.
[03:04:09.668 --> 03:04:13.429]  They also forced, I mean they forced Remington out of business.
[03:04:13.469 --> 03:04:16.790]  The same law firm suing me sued Remington out of business.
[03:04:17.851 --> 03:04:18.011]  Yeah.
[03:04:18.942 --> 03:04:26.767]  Another law they're trying to pass is to ban all semi-automatic weapons in my state, which means anything... Well, you know what a semi-automatic is.
[03:04:26.807 --> 03:04:28.068]  Anything semi-automatic?
[03:04:28.648 --> 03:04:29.488]  Yeah, anything.
[03:04:29.508 --> 03:04:32.190]  Anything you pull the trigger, it shoots a bullet.
[03:04:33.051 --> 03:04:35.232]  Right, and that has a detachable magazine.
[03:04:36.894 --> 03:04:41.695]  Well, brother, they're suing me up in Connecticut, and their goal, they admit, is to, quote, shut me down.
[03:04:41.715 --> 03:04:44.236]  So I'll probably be seeing you up there in Connecticut, down the road, Andy.
[03:04:44.256 --> 03:04:44.556]  Thank you.
[03:04:44.876 --> 03:04:48.537]  To Joe and Douglas and Phillip and Andy, another Andy, I apologize.
[03:04:49.037 --> 03:04:50.618]  Call me back tomorrow, I'll put you in the front of the line.
[03:04:50.998 --> 03:04:52.498]  Matt Bracken, in 60 seconds.
[03:04:52.938 --> 03:04:54.259]  Thank you all for what you do, folks.
[03:04:54.819 --> 03:04:56.979]  Understand, you are the power that moves the ball in the field.
[03:04:57.379 --> 03:04:58.480]  So tell folks about the broadcast.
[03:04:58.760 --> 03:04:59.080]  Thank you.
[03:04:59.180 --> 03:04:59.740]  Again, thank you.
[03:05:06.877 --> 03:05:09.559]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[03:05:09.899 --> 03:05:15.802]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.

[03:06:17.367 --> 03:06:24.872]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:06:25.853 --> 03:06:29.755]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:30.196 --> 03:06:34.018]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:06:34.378 --> 03:06:35.960]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:36.480 --> 03:06:42.024]  Take the children and yourself and hide out in the cellar.
[03:06:43.164 --> 03:06:45.566]  Right now the fighting will begin.
[03:06:47.168 --> 03:06:50.450]  Yeah, you better hide in the cellar with what's coming.
[03:06:51.051 --> 03:06:54.513]  I don't know if you've heard the latest false flag attack.
[03:06:55.133 --> 03:06:59.796]  It appears that some actor I never heard of before today named Jussie Smollett.
[03:07:00.697 --> 03:07:05.740]  This is Matt Bracken, by the way, not Alex and not Paul Joseph Watson filling in today.
[03:07:06.421 --> 03:07:08.783]  Anyway, there's a TV show called Empire.
[03:07:09.003 --> 03:07:09.723]  I've never seen it.
[03:07:11.684 --> 03:07:16.848]  I don't know what it's about, but there's an actor named Jussie Smollett, and I guess he's a black
[03:07:17.672 --> 03:07:27.216]  Uh, gay guy, and he claims that he was beaten up by some MAGA, some MAGA thugs in Chicago at two o'clock in the morning, uh, last night.
[03:07:27.916 --> 03:07:29.497]  And he drove himself to the hospital.
[03:07:29.517 --> 03:07:30.737]  Didn't call the police.
[03:07:31.558 --> 03:07:36.560]  Uh, you know, he said that these, uh, these white racist MAGA guys were wandering around Chicago.
[03:07:36.600 --> 03:07:38.140]  I guess it was negative 20.
[03:07:38.761 --> 03:07:41.942]  This is when Jussie Smollett at two o'clock in the morning was
[03:07:42.643 --> 03:07:46.106]  Out going to a subway for his late night snack.
[03:07:46.407 --> 03:07:51.531]  Everybody does that in Chicago when it's minus 20 and the wind chills like minus 50.
[03:07:52.692 --> 03:07:58.637]  But there he was out on the sidewalk and some MAGA people wearing ski masks.
[03:07:59.758 --> 03:08:03.081]  Beat him up and threw bleach on him and put a noose around his neck.
[03:08:03.942 --> 03:08:07.946]  Now, obviously this sounds like it's complete BS.
[03:08:08.835 --> 03:08:33.147]  And you would think that a week after the Covington event was exposed as a complete hoax, you know, where the media rearranged the facts in that initial clip to say that these MAGA hat-wearing kids surrounded this poor Native American elder who was just harmlessly tapping on his tom-tom drum, and these white racist MAGA kids practically lynched him.
[03:08:33.507 --> 03:08:35.908]  They were on the ball moose ready to lynch him.
[03:08:35.928 --> 03:08:37.869]  Of course, that turned out to be complete
[03:08:38.416 --> 03:08:39.717]  Complete BS.
[03:08:40.698 --> 03:08:54.908]  Now this Jussie Smollett is throwing his fuel on the fire, claiming that some MAGA people, people saying, you know, this is for MAGA, who are wearing ski masks with bleach and nooses out at two o'clock in the morning.
[03:08:55.638 --> 03:09:01.200]  Just happened to spot him and said, you're that gay black guy from Empire!
[03:09:01.440 --> 03:09:08.622]  As if people who were MAGA supporters like me, I would have no idea who this guy was or what the TV show was.
[03:09:09.422 --> 03:09:12.704]  But they just happened to spot him and practically lynch him.
[03:09:13.524 --> 03:09:18.525]  Now, if you go to the TMZ story, there's already something like 4,000 comments.
[03:09:19.426 --> 03:09:23.227]  And when I saw one, I just went to newest comments to see how they're rolling in.
[03:09:23.951 --> 03:09:32.698]  And I saw one that said, you know, you MAGA guys are going to be eradicated soon, which sounds an awful lot like a call for genocide.
[03:09:33.538 --> 03:09:39.743]  So I left a comment, you know, I left a comment saying, hey, boy, there's the left calling for genocide again.
[03:09:40.604 --> 03:09:43.986]  And the guy then comes back and says, I'll be in the ground soon.
[03:09:44.767 --> 03:09:46.288]  This song brings up
[03:09:47.037 --> 03:09:58.363]  The subject of Covington, which led to, yesterday, not one, but three different really good articles being written about the subject of the left's push.
[03:09:58.423 --> 03:09:59.944]  You can call it nothing else now.
[03:10:00.565 --> 03:10:07.288]  It's the preparatory stage for what would become a genocide of conservative white males.
[03:10:07.949 --> 03:10:10.570]  We've seen this in history over and over again.
[03:10:10.650 --> 03:10:13.932]  Before, we're a big socialist power grab.
[03:10:13.952 --> 03:10:15.753]  When they really go full commie,
[03:10:16.809 --> 03:10:19.071]  They're going to wreck the economy, that's a given.
[03:10:19.551 --> 03:10:32.741]  But they're never going to say, whoopsie, it was our fault, our stupid socialist programs, our $30 trillion free-everything-for-everybody program blew up the economy, must be our fault as socialists.
[03:10:33.436 --> 03:10:34.656]  Hell no, they never do that.
[03:10:34.737 --> 03:10:39.318]  They just say it was the evil enemies of the state.
[03:10:39.398 --> 03:10:43.720]  In our case, it'll be those Christian white conservative men.
[03:10:44.220 --> 03:10:47.561]  They sabotaged our glorious socialist program.
[03:10:47.981 --> 03:10:49.182]  They do this every time.
[03:10:49.942 --> 03:10:56.244]  In Germany, the National Socialists that we call the Nazis, they scapegoated the Jews.
[03:10:58.649 --> 03:11:04.510]  The Soviet Union, it was the slightly better-to-do farmers that they called the kulaks.
[03:11:05.151 --> 03:11:09.892]  You know, in China, in communist China, they called them the landlord class.
[03:11:10.452 --> 03:11:18.594]  So this is a way that the socialists, as they gather all the power to themselves, it's really a brilliant strategy.
[03:11:19.214 --> 03:11:23.995]  Because they get to unify their base in hatred and anger, very effective.
[03:11:25.003 --> 03:11:38.111]  They get to shift the blame for their own economic disasters onto their potential rivals, the people that, you know, years down the road might lead to a counter-revolution.
[03:11:38.591 --> 03:11:47.096]  So you get your base fired up and then you send them out to wipe out your future political rivals, just eradicate them.
[03:11:47.656 --> 03:11:52.459]  Sometimes it's done like in Germany with gas chambers or in the Soviet Union with gulags.
[03:11:53.092 --> 03:12:03.377]  Sometimes, like in Cambodia or Rwanda, it's done just at the local level with machetes, you know, with small arms and machetes.
[03:12:04.617 --> 03:12:11.020]  It doesn't require, you know, a huge infrastructure of gas chambers if the state riles up the anger to that extent.
[03:12:12.441 --> 03:12:21.746]  The article that I wrote about this week is up on a website called American Partisan that I strongly recommend everybody follow.
[03:12:21.887 --> 03:12:27.730]  It's primarily military tactical prepper kind of articles.
[03:12:28.550 --> 03:12:33.653]  But my article is called Covington Gives a Glimpse of Civil War II.
[03:12:34.711 --> 03:12:40.913]  And over at townhall.com, Kurt Schlichter has an article up on the same exact subject.
[03:12:40.973 --> 03:12:41.594]  I couldn't believe it.
[03:12:41.654 --> 03:12:43.114]  All of these came out on Monday.
[03:12:44.315 --> 03:12:51.157]  And at Front Page Magazine, there's actually an article up yesterday called Exterminating Whitey.
[03:12:51.818 --> 03:12:55.982]  Instead of killing Whitey, instead of kill Whitey, it's exterminate Whitey.
[03:12:56.302 --> 03:13:00.546]  So after Covington, it's obvious that people are starting to think about this subject.
[03:13:01.066 --> 03:13:01.967]  And it's no wonder.
[03:13:03.368 --> 03:13:10.714]  The thing that's very foreseeable about the socialists is that they appeal to the morons.
[03:13:10.794 --> 03:13:14.017]  They appeal to people who are not historically astute.
[03:13:14.758 --> 03:13:16.279]  So when they whip up this anger,
[03:13:17.159 --> 03:13:21.863]  It hits their base like it's something brand new that never happened in history.
[03:13:22.344 --> 03:13:27.669]  Oh my God, we have an enemy that's trying to hold us down, these conservative Christian whites.
[03:13:27.729 --> 03:13:32.854]  They're responsible for all the evil in the world, and we've just got to get rid of them.
[03:13:33.374 --> 03:13:36.637]  They're too dumb to realize you're being played for fools.
[03:13:36.717 --> 03:13:38.439]  This is what they do every time.
[03:13:38.519 --> 03:13:40.220]  This is a perpetual pattern.
[03:13:41.061 --> 03:13:41.862]  On the other hand,
[03:13:42.697 --> 03:13:45.819]  Our side, the conservatives, we've studied this.
[03:13:46.399 --> 03:13:53.383]  We've studied the French Revolution, the Bolshevik Revolution, and every socialist revolution ever since then.
[03:13:53.883 --> 03:14:08.711]  So this gives us a huge advantage, because essentially, one team is comprised of morons like Kamala Harris and AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, that are historically illiterate,
[03:14:09.346 --> 03:14:17.276]  And the other side, not only are we armed to the teeth, you know, and know how to shoot and know tactics, but we've read their playbook.
[03:14:17.336 --> 03:14:23.204]  We've read a playbook, and they don't even understand that it is their playbook because they're historical illiterates.
[03:14:23.843 --> 03:14:44.723]  So when it comes to them trying to whip up their base for days of rage, for just taking it out on every white kid with a red MAGA hat standing around on the Lincoln Memorial, or just blaming people in Chicago at 2 a.m., you know, phantoms, imaginary bogus enemies.
[03:14:45.572 --> 03:14:53.718]  They think that's going to accomplish the mission of leading to such anger that white conservatives are just pushed out of public life.
[03:14:54.538 --> 03:14:57.380]  Genocides don't start with the final solution.
[03:14:57.760 --> 03:15:01.523]  Genocides start with first marginalizing your enemies.
[03:15:02.243 --> 03:15:05.225]  Taking away their ability to practice their professions.
[03:15:05.285 --> 03:15:06.466]  You de-license them.
[03:15:06.486 --> 03:15:07.727]  You de-platform them.
[03:15:08.567 --> 03:15:11.049]  If they had professorship, you get rid of that.
[03:15:11.509 --> 03:15:13.751]  Well, we can see with political correctness
[03:15:14.429 --> 03:15:16.970]  How far down that road we've actually already gone.
[03:15:17.971 --> 03:15:21.993]  Our universities are 100% left-wing social justice warrior.
[03:15:22.653 --> 03:15:32.057]  Any conservatives on campus are practically, you know, underground, like putting the fish symbol on the wall, like in early Christian Rome.
[03:15:32.698 --> 03:15:41.822]  So we can see that they've already done a great job of deplatforming conservatives, of stigmatizing us, of bullying us into silence.
[03:15:42.785 --> 03:15:52.027]  And the next stage is going to be calling for their minions to just, you know, punch that smirking MAGA kid in the face, which we've already seen.
[03:15:52.607 --> 03:15:53.968]  We saw that after Covington.
[03:15:54.128 --> 03:16:01.749]  And a week later, now it's some B-list actor claiming that, you know, white racist MAGAs beat him up.
[03:16:02.870 --> 03:16:11.872]  Imagine if InfoWars hadn't been here to expose the global government, to expose their plan to implode national sovereignty and nation's borders.
[03:16:12.978 --> 03:16:20.722]  Imagine if the lights had been turned off all those years, and the incredibly important topics we talk about hadn't been discussed.
[03:16:22.303 --> 03:16:25.925]  But it's because of you doing that over the years that we're here.
[03:16:26.665 --> 03:16:28.126]  And that's not some platitude.
[03:16:28.166 --> 03:16:29.327]  That's not some pat on the back.
[03:16:30.527 --> 03:16:36.391]  That is the humble recognition that you are the sea on which all of us sail.
[03:16:38.112 --> 03:16:38.652]  I'm the sea.
[03:16:38.812 --> 03:16:39.432]  You're the sea.
[03:16:39.972 --> 03:16:40.453]  I'm the wind.
[03:16:42.133 --> 03:16:42.774]  You're the wind.
[03:16:42.914 --> 03:16:45.235]  We are all the sails together in this.
[03:16:45.315 --> 03:16:53.101]  But if you hadn't resonated with what we talked about and what we did, if you hadn't prayed for us and spread the word and supported us, we wouldn't be here.
[03:16:53.702 --> 03:17:07.552]  If you hadn't been faithful in our shared destiny together, we wouldn't have already had these successes and nationalism exploding across the world and all the incredible positive things happening that have unfolded.
[03:17:09.253 --> 03:17:10.454]  But because of you, we've done that.
[03:17:11.374 --> 03:17:12.115]  There's an equation.
[03:17:13.175 --> 03:17:18.259]  If you spread the word about InfoWars and the articles, the videos, the links, we get around the enemy.
[03:17:18.980 --> 03:17:25.024]  And if you fund the information we're producing, it all comes together.
[03:17:25.665 --> 03:17:27.606]  But it comes down to that, chicken or the egg.
[03:17:28.607 --> 03:17:39.175]  If you don't fund the seed money to keep InfoWars on the air and to fight against the fake lawsuits and the attacks of Soros and Hillary and others, we won't have the information to put on air for all of you to spread.
[03:17:40.057 --> 03:17:47.160]  So each one is just as important, but the most critical point the enemy understands is cutting the funding off.
[03:17:48.480 --> 03:17:51.642]  They don't want to have us be live on air while all this unfolds.
[03:17:53.082 --> 03:17:58.925]  They don't want to have us be here while the globalists push their entire world government agenda and everything we've talked about comes true.
[03:17:59.465 --> 03:18:05.747]  They don't want us here where they try to assassinate nationalists and populist leaders and while they overrun Christian countries, the radical Islamists.
[03:18:06.128 --> 03:18:06.908]  They want us off the air.
[03:18:09.045 --> 03:18:12.066]  That's why I am in your hands, you're in my hands.
[03:18:12.446 --> 03:18:16.287]  If I give up, if I back down, if I waver, it's a big victory for the globalists.
[03:18:17.108 --> 03:18:20.589]  And if you back down, if you waver, it's a big victory for them as well.
[03:18:21.749 --> 03:18:24.490]  It's truly a life and death struggle.
[03:18:25.090 --> 03:18:26.651]  So all I'm going to say in closing is this.
[03:18:27.631 --> 03:18:29.071]  Our destinies are bound forever.
[03:18:30.672 --> 03:18:30.812]  And
[03:18:32.509 --> 03:18:36.711]  Doing something this epic almost feels sick to say, hey, come give me your money.
[03:18:37.532 --> 03:18:39.093]  But you've seen what I've done with your money.
[03:18:39.113 --> 03:18:42.474]  I have waged war, fearlessly and tirelessly.
[03:18:42.635 --> 03:18:44.356]  I have dominated globalists.
[03:18:44.436 --> 03:18:45.856]  I have overrun their emplacements.
[03:18:46.377 --> 03:18:50.939]  We have spread the message of liberty in 1776 worldwide, and we are committed to that destiny.
[03:18:51.419 --> 03:18:54.061]  And so with pride, I tell you, financially support us.
[03:18:54.801 --> 03:18:58.863]  Any other war chief in a fight for freedom would just say, support me, give me the funding now.
[03:18:59.044 --> 03:18:59.424]  I say,
[03:19:00.916 --> 03:19:06.720]  Get products of the best out there, win-win situation, fund us, and we're unstoppable together.
[03:19:07.281 --> 03:19:10.603]  If we don't do that, there's no future, and we have no shared destiny.
[03:19:11.624 --> 03:19:19.089]  I'm very sad that Supermill Vitality, our flagship product, is no longer available when it sells out, because we can't get the wild, crafted herbs.
[03:19:19.610 --> 03:19:24.033]  The process it goes through is so organic, like making of wine, that it can't be produced anymore.
[03:19:24.794 --> 03:19:25.894]  So that's why it's the last run.
[03:19:26.923 --> 03:19:29.265]  It's available 50% off, even though it's our last run.
[03:19:29.285 --> 03:19:32.168]  M4Store.com because I want you to experience it before it's gone.
[03:19:33.083 --> 03:19:37.145]  But whatever you do, pray for InfoWars, spread the articles, spread the links, spread the videos.
[03:19:37.446 --> 03:19:40.407]  Because without you, we are going to basically be destroyed.
[03:19:40.908 --> 03:19:43.489]  But with your support, together we all go into the future.
[03:19:43.869 --> 03:19:52.494]  Whatever you do, just remember that the power of you, via word of mouth, speaking out and taking action, is the most powerful thing in the universe, next to God.
[03:19:53.235 --> 03:19:58.218]  And for your support, and your undying prayers, I thank you, and I salute you.
[03:19:58.238 --> 03:20:00.719]  But more importantly, we are bound, and I love you.
[03:20:01.280 --> 03:20:01.680]  So thank you.
[03:20:06.276 --> 03:20:15.858]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.999 --> 03:20:29.260]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:29.820 --> 03:20:33.181]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:20:36.787 --> 03:20:42.848]  Okay, I'm back, and I apologize for the picture quality before.
[03:20:42.908 --> 03:20:48.289]  I hope that the Skype connection resolves and it stays a little tighter this time.
[03:20:49.049 --> 03:21:06.313]  But yeah, we're talking about a pretty grim subject, and a lot of people probably don't want to talk about it, but, you know, people think that being Americans, it's going to give us some kind of perpetual immunity from the kinds of social afflictions that have plagued other countries in history.
[03:21:07.375 --> 03:21:16.878]  But when you see communists becoming proud about it and admitting it, you know, saying, oh, I'm a democratic socialist or nothing so bad about the communists.
[03:21:17.018 --> 03:21:18.538]  I mean, they've got TV shows.
[03:21:18.578 --> 03:21:21.279]  Van Jones was a communist on television.
[03:21:22.360 --> 03:21:23.880]  It's a very old pattern.
[03:21:24.760 --> 03:21:36.404]  And when you see conservatives basically marginalized and pushed to the outskirts of society as some kind of lepers by academia, the media,
[03:21:38.194 --> 03:21:40.315]  All of the leftists in Congress.
[03:21:40.996 --> 03:21:44.918]  You see the Republicans in Congress, except for the Freedom Caucus and a few others.
[03:21:45.959 --> 03:21:49.861]  They're a bunch of, you know, gutless, spineless rhinos.
[03:21:51.482 --> 03:21:57.326]  It does make you start feeling like you've almost got a, you know, a gold star pinned to your shirt.
[03:21:58.267 --> 03:22:05.772]  You know, the idea now is to make the MAGA hat, make the saying, Make America Great Again,
[03:22:06.781 --> 03:22:11.184]  The equivalent of a Ku Klux Klan hood or a Nazi uniform.
[03:22:11.804 --> 03:22:21.310]  If you look at the comments under the TMZ article about Jussie Smollett, you can see the outlines of the Civil War.
[03:22:22.011 --> 03:22:28.835]  The left is just accepting that it's a true story and saying, basically, we've got to kill these MAGA people.
[03:22:29.401 --> 03:22:35.063]  So if you believe that we should make America great again, you're now a Nazi and a Klansman.
[03:22:35.723 --> 03:22:39.184]  Not only should you not wear the hat, you should just shut up and disappear.
[03:22:39.944 --> 03:22:46.826]  And if you don't, somebody's going to smash you in the mouth or, as the comment was to me, put you in the ground.
[03:22:47.846 --> 03:22:51.107]  And I don't think it even matters to them if it's a true story or not.
[03:22:51.627 --> 03:22:56.969]  Because to the left, you know, the truth of the story is, does it further the narrative?
[03:22:57.029 --> 03:22:58.389]  Does it further the mission?
[03:22:59.442 --> 03:23:09.168]  Communists, and I include progressives, socialists, democratic socialists, all of these to me, they're communists.
[03:23:09.568 --> 03:23:23.255]  The left, from the French Revolution through the communist revolutions of the 20th century, something that's very important to understand about them, they believe in Marxism as if it's a religion.
[03:23:23.415 --> 03:23:27.778]  Now, they'll claim that they're atheists and that they don't believe in God,
[03:23:28.470 --> 03:23:31.312]  But their god is this cult of socialism.
[03:23:32.052 --> 03:23:43.019]  And in the advancement of their religion, their secular, atheistic, false religion, communism, they believe that the ends justify any means.
[03:23:43.699 --> 03:23:58.008]  This is why they get along so well with Islamists, because they too believe that anything goes if it advances the global spread of either communism in that camp or Islamism in the other camp.
[03:23:58.957 --> 03:24:04.301]  And that's why both of them, I believe in something that the Islamists call taqiyya.
[03:24:04.961 --> 03:24:21.213]  Taqiyya means that Muslims can lie about their real goals, and it's not a lie, because they're just lying to infidels, and if it helps to spread Islam, to temporarily get people off of their guard to lie to them, then it's a good thing.
[03:24:21.673 --> 03:24:24.996]  Well, Communists believe the exact same thing.
[03:24:25.643 --> 03:24:30.408]  So, to a communist, it's completely legit to say, I'm not a communist.
[03:24:31.188 --> 03:24:32.129]  I'm a Democrat.
[03:24:32.630 --> 03:24:33.691]  I'm a progressive.
[03:24:34.251 --> 03:24:35.332]  I'm a socialist.
[03:24:35.873 --> 03:24:43.120]  You know, I don't believe in that real hard communism, you know, with the gulags and the firing squads.
[03:24:43.840 --> 03:24:46.423]  I just want something like Scandinavia.
[03:24:46.863 --> 03:24:50.747]  But in fact, and not many progressives probably understand this,
[03:24:51.485 --> 03:24:59.669]  The Scandinavian countries in the last 20 years actually rank higher on the freedom indexes than the United States of America.
[03:25:00.029 --> 03:25:03.151]  They have less regulation and control of their business than we do.
[03:25:03.811 --> 03:25:10.834]  So if you're looking at any socialist countries today, you have to look at Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea.
[03:25:11.455 --> 03:25:14.196]  These are the examples, and it's where it always leads.
[03:25:14.796 --> 03:25:19.939]  But the socialist bosses, as opposed to their moron minions,
[03:25:20.692 --> 03:25:36.824]  The socialist bosses, they know, the smart ones, they know, and I don't include AOC as one of the smart ones, I think she's an idiot true believer, but the smart party bosses, they know that socialism will wreck an economy.
[03:25:36.884 --> 03:25:37.665]  They understand it.
[03:25:38.325 --> 03:25:39.126]  And they don't care.
[03:25:39.626 --> 03:25:45.351]  Because their base, their moron minions, are just cannon fodder for them.
[03:25:47.792 --> 03:25:52.211]  The liberal elite, the progressive elite, they look at California
[03:25:52.970 --> 03:25:54.691]  And they see the same things that we do.
[03:25:55.192 --> 03:26:02.336]  We see tent cities with tens of thousands of people living in squalor in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
[03:26:03.417 --> 03:26:05.778]  And they see feces and needles on the sidewalks.
[03:26:05.939 --> 03:26:07.520]  We think, what a disaster.
[03:26:07.560 --> 03:26:11.462]  The Democrats must be so terribly embarrassed and humiliated.
[03:26:11.842 --> 03:26:12.523]  But they're not.
[03:26:13.003 --> 03:26:18.947]  They look at California as a brilliant, shining example of political victory.
[03:26:19.586 --> 03:26:21.115]  I call it Kalazuela.
[03:26:21.195 --> 03:26:22.120]  I didn't coin the term.
[03:26:22.181 --> 03:26:23.488]  I've seen it around on the internet.
[03:26:24.068 --> 03:26:32.653]  But Kala Zewaila is taking what used to be called the Golden State, and they're turning it into a halfway house to Venezuela.
[03:26:33.354 --> 03:26:43.280]  And not only that, they're using that as the model for the other 49 states for how to take complete political control.
[03:26:43.840 --> 03:26:48.183]  You do it when you're almost, you know, 49-51 Democrat-Republican.
[03:26:48.663 --> 03:26:51.745]  You do it by flooding the country with illegal aliens.
[03:26:52.483 --> 03:27:01.932]  In California, when you arrive, they announce with billboards and radio ads, don't worry, go to the DMZ and you'll get a driver's license.
[03:27:02.052 --> 03:27:04.254]  We don't care who you are or where you came from.
[03:27:04.914 --> 03:27:09.999]  When you get your driver's license, they hand you the form for a voter card.
[03:27:10.692 --> 03:27:25.627]  And then they announce, they don't just not have any investigations of voter fraud, they announce that we have never had an investigation of voter fraud in California by the state itself, outside groups have tried.
[03:27:26.467 --> 03:27:30.892]  But this is how California went from electing Ronald Reagan and Ed Wilson
[03:27:31.576 --> 03:27:36.437]  To becoming solid, permanent, Democrat, one-party state.
[03:27:36.857 --> 03:27:39.818]  Not only is it one party, they have super majorities.
[03:27:39.878 --> 03:27:41.659]  The Republicans have no power.
[03:27:41.699 --> 03:27:45.600]  They've been gerrymandered into nothing, into having zero power.
[03:27:45.940 --> 03:27:54.562]  They're now doing something called vote harvesting, going door-to-door, collecting votes from their manions that are too lazy to go to the polls.
[03:27:55.122 --> 03:27:59.083]  And this is now the model that's extending to the rest of the country,
[03:27:59.663 --> 03:28:05.248]  And this is why Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats refuse to build a border wall.
[03:28:05.648 --> 03:28:16.817]  When they see these caravans coming to walk across a border that has no fence, just in some places so-called vehicle barriers, they don't see that as a problem.
[03:28:17.238 --> 03:28:21.561]  They see that as their roadmap to permanent political victory.
[03:28:23.472 --> 03:28:32.874]  When we come back, we'll start taking calls maybe in the next segment, and the number to call is 877-789-2539.
[03:28:32.954 --> 03:28:37.835]  That's 877-789-ALEX.
[03:28:38.055 --> 03:28:48.237]  And we'll start taking some calls about the caravans turning all of America into Kalisuela and Covington and everything else.
[03:28:48.357 --> 03:28:51.418]  And we'll be back right after these spots.
[03:29:05.427 --> 03:29:08.128]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.

[03:30:14.115 --> 03:30:17.337]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:30:17.937 --> 03:30:25.981]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:30:26.921 --> 03:30:36.285]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[03:30:36.985 --> 03:30:40.867]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[03:30:40.927 --> 03:30:46.830]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[03:30:46.890 --> 03:30:49.711]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[03:30:49.931 --> 03:30:51.152]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:30:51.432 --> 03:30:54.453]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[03:31:02.607 --> 03:31:03.288]  Here's the thing.
[03:31:03.308 --> 03:31:04.549]  I know how metaphysics work.
[03:31:04.569 --> 03:31:05.790]  I know how the universe works.
[03:31:06.450 --> 03:31:08.512]  I know how the cow ate the cabbage.
[03:31:09.713 --> 03:31:13.335]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[03:31:14.256 --> 03:31:17.479]  I can go on air and tell people that InfoWars could shut down.
[03:31:18.699 --> 03:31:20.100]  And that would be a very true statement.
[03:31:20.921 --> 03:31:21.742]  If I don't have the will,
[03:31:24.867 --> 03:31:28.211]  Infowars could shut down tomorrow.
[03:31:28.271 --> 03:31:33.077]  If I fight as hard as I can and people don't support us, we shut down in a year.
[03:31:34.519 --> 03:31:37.242]  You support us and get creative and get fired up.
[03:31:37.682 --> 03:31:38.884]  We won't just be here 100 years.
[03:31:38.904 --> 03:31:39.645]  We'll be here forever.
[03:31:40.025 --> 03:31:41.106]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[03:31:42.287 --> 03:31:50.476]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[03:31:50.877 --> 03:31:55.081]  Unlike all these other test cases that God put in place, you know, there's a lot of eggs.
[03:31:55.642 --> 03:31:58.385]  We're proud of what we brought you and the whole family of InfoWars products.
[03:31:58.845 --> 03:31:59.987]  Without you, we won't be here.
[03:32:03.206 --> 03:32:06.510]  Now you've stayed vigilant, you've been pushing the site, and you've been helping us get it out there.
[03:32:06.610 --> 03:32:10.154]  But if you don't keep pushing, this is an ongoing fight we're going to lose.
[03:32:10.354 --> 03:32:13.457]  So please, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:32:13.577 --> 03:32:14.558]  Get that link out to everybody.

[03:32:52.745 --> 03:32:58.510]  Get TurboForce today at InfoWarsLive.com, but I recommend you only take half a dose the first time.
[03:32:58.610 --> 03:33:00.512]  Beware the power of TurboForce!
[03:33:06.218 --> 03:33:08.821]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.337 --> 03:33:27.297]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:27.718 --> 03:33:31.638]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:33:31.998 --> 03:33:35.219]  Okay, Bracken is back for the next half an hour.
[03:33:35.279 --> 03:33:37.560]  And we will be taking phone calls at 877-789-2539.
[03:33:37.580 --> 03:33:38.100]  That's 789-ALEX.
[03:33:38.260 --> 03:33:39.340]  And I know this is
[03:33:53.542 --> 03:33:59.243]  This is a subject that is touchy and people are going to say, you know, boy, you're really going off the deep end.
[03:33:59.263 --> 03:34:06.065]  This is very hyperbolic to talk about, you know, the left pushing for genocide in America.
[03:34:06.785 --> 03:34:14.406]  But understand, outside of maybe some deep thinkers on their side, they don't see it as a plan to commit genocide.
[03:34:14.526 --> 03:34:20.768]  I mean, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Kamala Harris, they would look at me and say, you're completely crazy.
[03:34:20.808 --> 03:34:21.788]  We don't plan to do that.
[03:34:22.395 --> 03:34:33.223]  We just plan to push for a new economic freedom where everybody will be equal and the law will be on the side of all.
[03:34:33.284 --> 03:34:34.685]  We'll all be exactly the same.
[03:34:34.725 --> 03:34:38.628]  In other words, we're going to just force America to become communist.
[03:34:39.568 --> 03:34:41.830]  Now, of course, this will wreck the economy.
[03:34:42.851 --> 03:34:43.892]  And then they'll say,
[03:34:44.617 --> 03:34:45.338]  We didn't do it.
[03:34:45.418 --> 03:34:46.499]  We had a great plan.
[03:34:46.539 --> 03:34:47.960]  We had a five-year plan.
[03:34:48.381 --> 03:34:55.988]  What happened was those conservative, Christian, mostly white businessmen, they just wouldn't cooperate.
[03:34:56.008 --> 03:34:59.271]  They sabotaged us at every step.
[03:34:59.892 --> 03:35:02.114]  This is what they did in Venezuela, exactly.
[03:35:02.594 --> 03:35:07.539]  They said, okay, people that are selling products in supermarkets, bakeries,
[03:35:08.467 --> 03:35:09.951]  You can't sell it more than this.
[03:35:10.232 --> 03:35:11.957]  Well, then I'm just not going to bake bread.
[03:35:11.997 --> 03:35:15.326]  If you're telling me I can't sell at a profit, I won't bake bread.
[03:35:15.973 --> 03:35:19.294]  Then they order the baker, you must open and sell the bread.
[03:35:19.314 --> 03:35:23.895]  I mean, you can imagine this is like a guaranteed way to absolutely wreck an economy.
[03:35:24.415 --> 03:35:25.375]  But then what do they do?
[03:35:25.395 --> 03:35:32.577]  Do they say, you know what, maybe we ought to loosen up that free market economy and let the miracle of capitalism run?
[03:35:32.897 --> 03:35:33.397]  No way.
[03:35:33.857 --> 03:35:40.079]  They charge the bakers and the supermarket owners, you know, with economic treason and throw them into jail.
[03:35:40.519 --> 03:35:45.460]  They put soldiers in the bakery to bake the bread, who don't know anything about baking bread.
[03:35:46.258 --> 03:35:49.220]  Nobody's going to supply the flour because they won't be paid.
[03:35:49.921 --> 03:35:52.743]  And then they just continue to make it worse and worse.
[03:35:53.744 --> 03:35:59.188]  They charge the capitalist business owners with greater and greater crimes.
[03:35:59.248 --> 03:36:00.449]  They throw them into prison.
[03:36:01.010 --> 03:36:03.332]  And the rest of them will flee the country.
[03:36:03.974 --> 03:36:05.695]  And that's how it always works.
[03:36:06.075 --> 03:36:10.437]  So they don't start out in year one with a plan for genocide.
[03:36:10.977 --> 03:36:26.423]  It's just that their socialist system will be so ruinous to the economy that when they look for the reasons why the economy was wrecked, they'll always look to the conservative business people and start throwing them into jail.
[03:36:26.883 --> 03:36:28.904]  Now, the difference in our country
[03:36:29.565 --> 03:36:34.686]  Unlike, for example, Venezuela and many other countries, you know, Germany in the 1930s.
[03:36:35.627 --> 03:36:36.767]  We've studied this.
[03:36:36.947 --> 03:36:37.907]  We're aware of this.
[03:36:38.588 --> 03:36:50.471]  So, to me, as far as I'm concerned, this is the reason why, you know, tens of millions of AR-15s have been purchased in the last, you know, 10 or 15 years.
[03:36:51.131 --> 03:36:58.333]  And almost every one that I've seen, unless it's an absolute newbie, every AR-15 I see has a scope on top.
[03:36:58.999 --> 03:37:01.421]  And you know, these aren't being purchased by hunters.
[03:37:01.761 --> 03:37:03.002]  Primarily, I don't hunt.
[03:37:03.122 --> 03:37:07.486]  I mean, once in a while I get invited, but I'm not, I don't consider myself a hunter.
[03:37:08.146 --> 03:37:14.491]  I consider myself a shooter and I consider myself a constitutionalist, you know, and an American.
[03:37:15.112 --> 03:37:20.036]  So when the, when the socialists pull their same old play,
[03:37:20.683 --> 03:37:30.146]  You know, let's appeal to the morons, promise everybody a free lunch, free college, free healthcare, you know, what, free housing, they've already got free food.
[03:37:30.886 --> 03:37:36.568]  When that wrecks the economy, they think that they're just going to be able to take out their enemies, which is us.
[03:37:37.268 --> 03:37:42.149]  It's not going to happen, because at some point, there's going to be a massive social collision.
[03:37:42.769 --> 03:37:47.050]  And that massive social collision is going to result in a brutal civil war.
[03:37:49.287 --> 03:37:52.670]  I absolutely don't see any way around this.
[03:37:53.510 --> 03:37:54.431]  I just don't see it.
[03:37:56.112 --> 03:37:58.474]  I don't know what the Fort Sumter moment would be.
[03:37:59.094 --> 03:38:06.019]  It could be gun confiscation raids that just start ratcheting up, probably in a state like New Jersey or New York or California.
[03:38:07.120 --> 03:38:12.204]  Already we see these so-called red flag laws being pushed.
[03:38:12.304 --> 03:38:13.785]  I think I read in Florida
[03:38:14.608 --> 03:38:17.791]  They've used the red flag law something like 400 times.
[03:38:18.431 --> 03:38:21.033]  Often the people don't even own guns or they're just kids.
[03:38:21.133 --> 03:38:23.375]  You know, it's neighbors snitching on neighbor.
[03:38:24.116 --> 03:38:25.937]  Somebody made a threat about the school.
[03:38:26.437 --> 03:38:30.401]  So they go to the house to see if they've got any guns.
[03:38:31.181 --> 03:38:50.207]  You can see the potential for mischief if you combine these red flag laws with the phenomenon of swatting and you add in all of these hoax crimes that the left are so fond of doing where they accuse people of being MAGA hat wearing racist noose tires.
[03:38:50.707 --> 03:38:52.308]  It turns out to always be a hoax.
[03:38:52.728 --> 03:38:58.790]  Well, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that they're going to start swatting people with the red flag laws.
[03:38:59.525 --> 03:39:09.681]  to get the SWAT team to roll up to somebody's house that they think is well-armed, and eventually this is going to lead to a, you know, some kind of a Waco, where an entire family's wiped out.
[03:39:10.427 --> 03:39:17.229]  And I think that the people that actually are agitating for the revolutionary conditions, they'll welcome this.
[03:39:17.749 --> 03:39:24.251]  It will permit the state to use even greater force against their political enemies.
[03:39:25.172 --> 03:39:32.214]  They really need at this point some MAGA actual event as opposed to just more and more of these hoaxes.
[03:39:32.944 --> 03:39:39.226]  I think that they were they were hoping that Las Vegas was going to turn out to be, you know, some kind of a right winger.
[03:39:39.286 --> 03:39:41.647]  But instead, it looks like probably the opposite.
[03:39:42.827 --> 03:39:53.410]  And, you know, with this Jussie Smollett case, you can just see that they're just trying so hard to instigate a crisis based on, you know, the white racist boogeyman.
[03:39:54.030 --> 03:39:55.131]  And it's not happening.
[03:39:55.631 --> 03:39:59.152]  So these red flag laws might be a potential flashpoint
[03:39:59.758 --> 03:40:06.142]  Because it's very dangerous, you know, police start rolling up to houses in the middle of the night to take people's guns away.
[03:40:06.742 --> 03:40:10.624]  Well, it's been known for a long time that home invaders, what do they do?
[03:40:11.144 --> 03:40:13.426]  They bang on the door and yell, police, open up!
[03:40:14.226 --> 03:40:22.991]  I mean, if somebody bangs on your door at 3 o'clock in the morning, yelling, police, open up, you're, you know, you're not wide awake, you're not thinking clearly.
[03:40:23.571 --> 03:40:26.313]  Some people, like Roger Stone, he didn't even have a gun,
[03:40:27.489 --> 03:40:30.731]  29 FBI agents bust into his house with, you know, tactical gear.
[03:40:31.511 --> 03:40:39.175]  In that case, it all went real well, because he was prepared mentally, I think, to be arrested at any time, and he said he didn't even have a gun.
[03:40:39.855 --> 03:40:55.682]  But I know a lot of other people that have got all kind of, you know, video surveillance, all kind of intruder alarms, so that if anybody is stacking in their yard, you know, if the black SWAT team truck is outside,
[03:40:56.477 --> 03:41:00.938]  And they come across the perimeter, I know people that are going to be able to react to that.
[03:41:01.578 --> 03:41:08.460]  And just hearing FBI open up, banging on the door, it could result in a terrible situation.
[03:41:08.500 --> 03:41:24.023]  And I think that there are people on the left that would welcome that event, that are actually trying to instigate this situation, just so that they can have a real example of, you know, crazy right-wing gun nuts shooting a bunch of police officers.
[03:41:24.725 --> 03:41:28.248]  Something similar to that happened, I forget, in Louisiana.
[03:41:28.268 --> 03:41:29.089]  It was last night.
[03:41:29.910 --> 03:41:39.498]  Four police officers were shot just because some heroin dealers, instead of surrendering, they just got into a gun battle right off the bat.
[03:41:40.098 --> 03:41:46.003]  I guess that the body armor that the police were wearing saved them, but that's not always going to work.
[03:41:46.764 --> 03:41:49.987]  And we need to hopefully de-escalate this.
[03:41:51.033 --> 03:41:56.536]  Seriously explore these red flag laws, which I think are building up towards a real crisis in a flashpoint.
[03:41:57.077 --> 03:41:58.357]  Because the left wants it.
[03:41:58.978 --> 03:42:06.302]  The left is inventing incidents like the Covington event and this Jussie Smollett event.
[03:42:06.602 --> 03:42:09.504]  When there aren't real events, they'll invent them.
[03:42:10.185 --> 03:42:13.927]  And to get a real event, they'll instigate it.
[03:42:14.591 --> 03:42:17.753]  You know, we've seen it, and we can't fall for these things.
[03:42:17.813 --> 03:42:22.936]  We need to stand strong, like that kid on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
[03:42:23.417 --> 03:42:26.899]  You know, he just was guilty of smirking while standing there.
[03:42:27.419 --> 03:42:33.423]  Now just standing there is seen as aggressive if you're a conservative white male in this country.
[03:42:34.079 --> 03:42:36.260]  Alright, when we come back, we're going to go right to the phones.
[03:42:36.280 --> 03:42:36.420]  877-789-2539.
[03:42:36.440 --> 03:42:36.880]  789-ALEX.
[03:42:36.900 --> 03:42:38.341]  When we get back, we'll be taking the calls.
[03:42:38.361 --> 03:42:40.342]  And we'll see you on the other side of these spots.
[03:42:40.362 --> 03:42:40.942]  Thanks.
[03:43:05.248 --> 03:43:07.889]  I have not come to grips with how I'm supposed to announce this.
[03:43:09.229 --> 03:43:11.849]  And that's how I always say, this is coming up and I announce it right there.
[03:43:11.889 --> 03:43:18.911]  But I need to really think about this and look at it carefully before I make the announcement because I'm not quite sure what's happening or what we should do.
[03:43:18.971 --> 03:43:21.251]  But we're not going to be able to expand.
[03:43:22.351 --> 03:43:23.971]  And if we're not expanding, that means we're contracting.
[03:43:24.972 --> 03:43:27.392]  And then I look up and I say, I haven't cut new ads in weeks.
[03:43:27.792 --> 03:43:29.072]  I don't promote the products we've got.
[03:43:29.092 --> 03:43:30.273]  So it's my fault.
[03:43:30.293 --> 03:43:31.673]  But at the same time, I just want to cover news.
[03:43:33.362 --> 03:43:41.807]  I just need everybody listening to understand this is history happening, and if you don't go buy the products, and if you don't routinely buy them, sign up for AutoShip to get fluoride-free toothpaste.
[03:43:41.907 --> 03:43:44.188]  It's concentrated, four to five o'clock, a little silver and iodine.
[03:43:44.288 --> 03:43:56.274]  And if you don't get our new TurboForce that's beyond any energy drink you've ever had, it's healthy with all the trace elements and minerals and vitamin C and the amino acids and the organic caffeine stimulants, it's incredible.
[03:43:56.334 --> 03:43:58.075]  TurboForce, 33% off out of the gate.
[03:43:58.195 --> 03:44:02.878]  If you don't go get the products, the best fish roll for adults, the best fish roll for kids, Honor Roll,
[03:44:02.978 --> 03:44:04.039]  You don't get the very best.
[03:44:04.119 --> 03:44:04.659]  It's the best!
[03:44:04.779 --> 03:44:08.342]  I go up to top firms and say, I want to go above the top brand in the country.
[03:44:08.402 --> 03:44:10.784]  They go, what, 1% so you can say that?
[03:44:10.944 --> 03:44:11.084]  No!
[03:44:11.104 --> 03:44:11.445]  50% above them.
[03:44:11.485 --> 03:44:12.886]  Well, that won't fit in the capsule.
[03:44:13.026 --> 03:44:14.667]  Okay, we're 20% above the very best.
[03:44:14.887 --> 03:44:15.788]  And we're lower priced!
[03:44:15.908 --> 03:44:17.990]  That's our body's turmeric.
[03:44:18.130 --> 03:44:18.690]  Our fish oil.
[03:44:18.890 --> 03:44:19.391]  The best.
[03:44:19.571 --> 03:44:20.151]  The cleanest.
[03:44:20.251 --> 03:44:20.712]  The best.
[03:44:20.812 --> 03:44:21.352]  The cleanest.
[03:44:21.432 --> 03:44:25.195]  At a price lower than they sell Jeff Bezos at the damn Whole Foods.
[03:44:25.335 --> 03:44:31.320]  I'll tell you again, my job would be a lot easier if I didn't spend my time scrounging around for money.
[03:44:31.400 --> 03:44:34.003]  But you can sure as hell see that we're in the fight for our lives.
[03:44:34.043 --> 03:44:37.767]  So, you've all been committed to us, and you've bought a ton of great product that you love.
[03:44:37.947 --> 03:44:40.650]  Average 5.8 star on third-party review sites.
[03:44:40.790 --> 03:44:48.259]  But, if I don't get up here and explain to people that it's do or die, people don't take action and don't get the product.
[03:44:48.299 --> 03:44:48.439]  So...
[03:44:49.620 --> 03:44:50.581]  Here's what it comes down to.
[03:44:50.922 --> 03:44:53.545]  I don't want to cancel some of the shows we already have.
[03:44:53.685 --> 03:44:56.788]  And I sure as hell don't want to start curtailing how many reporters we have.
[03:44:56.848 --> 03:44:58.390]  We need more reporters.
[03:44:58.410 --> 03:44:59.071]  20 more reporters.
[03:44:59.411 --> 03:45:00.553]  I've got big plans.
[03:45:00.633 --> 03:45:01.574]  The enemy knows it.
[03:45:01.694 --> 03:45:03.156]  But I need money.
[03:45:03.396 --> 03:45:04.257]  All my assets.
[03:45:04.497 --> 03:45:05.898]  It's enough to run this place for three months.
[03:45:06.058 --> 03:45:08.219]  Again, I don't want the private jet airplane.
[03:45:08.659 --> 03:45:09.900]  I don't want the big mansions.
[03:45:09.920 --> 03:45:22.567]  I want to see the globalists in prison, and I want to see them not teaching five-year-olds how to put grasses on little boys, and I want to defeat this whole thing, but I need cold, hard cash from a barrelhead, and I need you to commit and say,
[03:45:22.947 --> 03:45:30.410]  I'm not giving money to the candy-ass church down the street that doesn't say anything about unborn babies and doesn't say anything about sexualization of children or rural government.
[03:45:30.550 --> 03:45:35.892]  I'm going to tithe every month to Infowarstore.com and I'm going to get products I need.
[03:45:36.112 --> 03:45:37.553]  I'm going to get things that are good.
[03:45:37.573 --> 03:45:38.693]  Buy books monthly.
[03:45:38.773 --> 03:45:39.834]  Buy videos monthly.
[03:45:39.974 --> 03:45:41.955]  After you're done watching them, donate them to the library.
[03:45:42.135 --> 03:45:42.895]  Hundreds will see it.
[03:45:42.975 --> 03:45:45.436]  Get the fish oil you need for your brain, your heart, your liver.
[03:45:45.516 --> 03:45:46.477]  Get it for your children.
[03:45:46.577 --> 03:45:52.519]  If you're in the military or law enforcement or want to work out hard or just want that turbo force energy, turbo force.
[03:45:52.679 --> 03:45:53.800]  There's nothing like it!
[03:45:53.921 --> 03:45:59.547]  It will be the number one next-level energy drink healthy alternative in the world if you just try it.
[03:45:59.848 --> 03:46:00.288]  It's simple.
[03:46:00.408 --> 03:46:01.930]  Other corporations don't do that.
[03:46:01.990 --> 03:46:08.057]  They go, we're gonna put it all in marketing, have a bunch of girls in swimsuits and NFL players say it's great, and then it's a bunch of crap.
[03:46:08.258 --> 03:46:09.499]  This is the best.
[03:46:09.619 --> 03:46:11.001]  This is TurboForce.
[03:46:11.181 --> 03:46:12.562]  That's not in competition with Brain Force.
[03:46:12.682 --> 03:46:14.022]  It's a nootropic with a little bit of energy.
[03:46:14.202 --> 03:46:15.202]  Knocks people's socks off.
[03:46:15.222 --> 03:46:16.623]  Because you never have the nootropic with the energy.
[03:46:16.723 --> 03:46:19.144]  This is everything with the nootropic and the energy.
[03:46:19.264 --> 03:46:21.985]  And quite frankly, most people should take a quarter to a half packet of it.
[03:46:22.025 --> 03:46:25.886]  Because I wanted to have the biggest, meanest, baddest thing out there that's healthy and clean.
[03:46:26.026 --> 03:46:28.387]  And it's just too damn Tyrannosaurus Rex.
[03:46:28.547 --> 03:46:31.468]  I mean, it is just fire-breathing amazing.
[03:46:31.568 --> 03:46:34.569]  So we did it again, thanks to the good Lord and the commitment to do it.
[03:46:34.689 --> 03:46:36.070]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:38.951 --> 03:46:43.139]  And it's a contest between our wills, Soros' will, and your will!
[03:46:43.740 --> 03:46:48.649]  InfoWars is only a focal point, but if you focus on what we're doing and pray for us, we pray for you.
[03:46:48.950 --> 03:46:51.033]  We're together and we're unstoppable!
[03:47:06.143 --> 03:47:08.748]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.597 --> 03:47:29.059]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:29.279 --> 03:47:32.240]  It's Matt Bracken.
[03:47:32.740 --> 03:47:35.401]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:35.421 --> 03:47:45.205]  Okay, I'm back and we're in the next part of the hour and we're going to go straight to the phone calls now.
[03:47:45.885 --> 03:47:49.327]  And I've got a lot of great phone calls stacked up here.
[03:47:49.347 --> 03:47:52.468]  And let's go to Mike in California.
[03:47:53.399 --> 03:47:55.200]  He wants to talk about the new A.G.
[03:47:55.240 --> 03:47:59.021]  I think that would be Mr. Barr, the swamp creature.
[03:48:00.142 --> 03:48:00.782]  Mike, are you there?
[03:48:01.662 --> 03:48:02.122]  Yes, sir.
[03:48:03.423 --> 03:48:03.603]  Yes.
[03:48:03.643 --> 03:48:05.664]  So thanks for receiving my call.
[03:48:06.204 --> 03:48:10.126]  And what my idea about thank you.
[03:48:10.306 --> 03:48:14.667]  What my idea about Barr was was that he may know where the bodies are buried.
[03:48:15.328 --> 03:48:21.330]  And I think that Trump is consciously aware that he's bringing in these globalists based on his
[03:48:22.496 --> 03:48:46.617]  Uh, affiliation with the John Burke Society, and he's I really think that he's manipulating the environment of this battlefield and everything that he's doing is gonna really prove out to be helpful, especially when you factor in our nationalist allies throughout the world and
[03:48:47.651 --> 03:49:00.495]  There's going to come a point where they share their intel with us and we share our intel with them to bring down the globalists in their areas and they're going to help us take down the globalists in our neck of the woods.
[03:49:01.156 --> 03:49:09.919]  So I really feel like his background with the Bushes and so forth, they're just exposing themselves.
[03:49:10.579 --> 03:49:12.319]  He's flushing them out.
[03:49:14.560 --> 03:49:23.069]  Yeah, Mike, I wish I shared your optimism, but Barr is a swamp creature from the very beginning.
[03:49:23.330 --> 03:49:30.497]  He's one of these deep-selected guys, CIA connections, straight into government.
[03:49:31.398 --> 03:49:33.441]  His wife plays cards with Mueller's wife.
[03:49:33.481 --> 03:49:35.062]  They're on a first-name basis.
[03:49:35.162 --> 03:49:36.404]  They see each other at church.
[03:49:37.205 --> 03:49:44.729]  I don't know how Trump was finagled into picking Barr, probably the same way he was finagled into picking Rosenstein.
[03:49:45.390 --> 03:49:54.075]  The swamp creatures around Trump say, oh, pick this guy because he's an easy confirmation and you can't afford a fight over the confirmation.
[03:49:54.635 --> 03:49:57.797]  Trump doesn't know any better, and the next thing you know, you've got a Rosenstein.
[03:49:58.337 --> 03:50:04.661]  I think, personally, Barr is going to turn out to be just as bad as McCabe, Mueller, Strzok, or the rest of them.
[03:50:05.245 --> 03:50:08.266]  His first loyalty is going to be to the deep state.
[03:50:08.746 --> 03:50:10.706]  You know, the senior executive service.
[03:50:11.487 --> 03:50:15.748]  These are the guys, doesn't matter Democrat, Republican, that's like a joke to these guys.
[03:50:16.488 --> 03:50:20.289]  These guys are only loyal to their own clique.
[03:50:20.909 --> 03:50:34.032]  They think that they're the guys that are holding up the pillars of heaven and that they've got to save the entire New World Order from these populist gay-hoos like Trump.
[03:50:34.778 --> 03:50:36.579]  That are like bull in a china shop.
[03:50:37.140 --> 03:50:46.067]  They literally think that they're doing God's work because us moron peasants are just too stupid to know what's best for them.
[03:50:46.347 --> 03:50:47.368]  That's best for us.
[03:50:47.928 --> 03:50:53.633]  And they've got to, therefore, you know, really steer the ship of state from offstage.
[03:50:54.133 --> 03:50:55.694]  And Trump is risking all of that.
[03:50:56.074 --> 03:50:56.795]  I hope I'm wrong.
[03:50:57.235 --> 03:51:00.338]  But, you know, everybody thought Sessions might do the trick.
[03:51:00.658 --> 03:51:01.298]  Huber might.
[03:51:01.539 --> 03:51:02.579]  None of these guys did.
[03:51:02.639 --> 03:51:03.600]  They're all deep state.
[03:51:04.161 --> 03:51:04.481]  Thanks, Mike.
[03:51:06.080 --> 03:51:09.202]  Let's go to Mary in Virginia.
[03:51:09.222 --> 03:51:12.384]  She wants to talk about a hate crime bill.
[03:51:12.784 --> 03:51:13.185]  Go ahead.
[03:51:13.405 --> 03:51:13.625]  Yes.
[03:51:14.045 --> 03:51:14.566]  Two things.
[03:51:15.046 --> 03:51:19.809]  First, political orientation needs to be added to the hate crime bill.
[03:51:20.310 --> 03:51:26.134]  So if someone wearing a MAGA hat is attacked verbally or physically, they get prosecuted.
[03:51:28.695 --> 03:51:36.381]  I don't know if that's going to run straight into First Amendment, I think, because, you know, I think that the entire hate crimes thing is a joke anyway.
[03:51:36.401 --> 03:51:39.844]  I mean, if you murder somebody, murderers should get the death penalty.
[03:51:39.884 --> 03:51:44.048]  I don't care if you had lust in your heart or racial anger in your heart.
[03:51:44.448 --> 03:51:45.429]  Murder is murder.
[03:51:45.989 --> 03:51:53.696]  And if you start talking about what somebody's political beliefs were, and then that's going to add or subtract years to your sentence,
[03:51:54.375 --> 03:51:57.236]  Well, I mean, that's that goes straight against the First Amendment.
[03:51:57.276 --> 03:52:00.256]  And I think that that would be that wouldn't stand up at all.
[03:52:00.316 --> 03:52:14.338]  And I think actually it would lead to more problems than it would solve, because anything that starts out with good, good intentions, the Democrats, the left, they'll usually take it over like asset forfeiture, you know, from the war on drugs, things like that.
[03:52:14.819 --> 03:52:19.219]  They'll take it over and they'll use that as an excuse to actually stifle free speech.
[03:52:19.919 --> 03:52:21.140]  And they always do that.
[03:52:22.520 --> 03:52:23.060]  Thanks, Mary.
[03:52:24.178 --> 03:52:28.179]  Casey in Mississippi wants to switch and talk about Venezuela.
[03:52:28.960 --> 03:52:30.000]  Are you still there, Casey?
[03:52:30.940 --> 03:52:31.900]  Yes, sir.
[03:52:31.940 --> 03:52:33.041]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:52:33.501 --> 03:52:34.641]  We're familiar with each other.
[03:52:34.701 --> 03:52:37.962]  My name is Eagle Eyes on a variety of platforms.
[03:52:39.162 --> 03:52:40.823]  I've seen some of your memes.
[03:52:40.883 --> 03:52:46.144]  You've got some solid charts, and I know that you know certain things that are going on.
[03:52:46.685 --> 03:52:51.546]  What I'd like to address today is, you know, organization is what they fear.
[03:52:52.048 --> 03:52:55.731]  We need to rebuild our communities from the ground up, our homes, everything else.
[03:52:55.771 --> 03:53:02.015]  I know people are aware of this, but we get lost in the cyclone of information that continuously rolls.
[03:53:02.915 --> 03:53:09.400]  We have to slow that down and be able to focus primarily on our homes, because they are coming with that Second Amendment push.
[03:53:10.000 --> 03:53:17.045]  They are going to try to take away our protection, which they protect themselves with, which is completely nonsense, as you know.
[03:53:17.265 --> 03:53:20.207]  Excuse me, I'm a little bit jazzed up.
[03:53:20.247 --> 03:53:21.248]  Thanks for taking the call again.
[03:53:21.964 --> 03:53:22.765]  No problem.
[03:53:23.686 --> 03:53:26.168]  We need to focus on our communities, on our homes.
[03:53:27.089 --> 03:53:28.470]  Rebuild neighbor-to-neighbor.
[03:53:29.451 --> 03:53:30.432]  Grow your own food.
[03:53:31.293 --> 03:53:31.813]  Stock up.
[03:53:32.054 --> 03:53:32.774]  Be prepared.
[03:53:32.974 --> 03:53:35.897]  Do not turn a blind eye to nonsense.
[03:53:36.478 --> 03:53:38.900]  We have no more time to turn away.
[03:53:39.481 --> 03:53:40.261]  The time is now.
[03:53:41.202 --> 03:53:41.643]  Thanks again.
[03:53:41.663 --> 03:53:43.805]  I appreciate the minute.
[03:53:43.825 --> 03:53:44.365]  No problem.
[03:53:44.445 --> 03:53:47.368]  And that's some good advice about stocking up, you know.
[03:53:48.442 --> 03:53:59.013]  If there is any kind of a major crisis, regional or national, you know, it would be nice to say that I have 10 years worth of food and I could stay in a bunker.
[03:53:59.033 --> 03:54:01.015]  But like, let's face it, that's not reality.
[03:54:01.675 --> 03:54:05.099]  A more likely situation, though, is that there could be a period of anarchy and
[03:54:05.871 --> 03:54:14.393]  Just not needing to go out to the already looted supermarket during those first few weeks when everybody's in a total panic.
[03:54:14.933 --> 03:54:30.717]  If you can stay home because you've prepared and you've got the food supplies and the nutraceuticals and the stored water or a well on your own property that you can run without electricity, your odds of getting through are going to be a lot greater.
[03:54:31.537 --> 03:54:33.998]  Sure, I mean, look, if it's an extinction-level event like the
[03:54:35.154 --> 03:54:40.218]  The comet that hit the Gulf of Mexico and wiped out the dinosaurs, nothing's going to help.
[03:54:40.758 --> 03:54:51.406]  But most events are going to be something that if you can just endure for a few weeks, months, or maybe years, but surviving the first month or two, that's going to be critical.
[03:54:52.046 --> 03:55:00.232]  If the power goes out, and it's not just because of a civil war or something like that, every one of the major powers are developing EMP weapons now.
[03:55:00.252 --> 03:55:04.555]  If you fire an ICBM from Russia to America, we know just where it came from.
[03:55:05.325 --> 03:55:10.089]  But if something pops out of the ocean and takes out our electrical grid, nobody's going to claim it.
[03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:15.073]  Our country will be wrecked, and we won't even know who to retaliate against, necessarily.
[03:55:16.935 --> 03:55:19.677]  Let's see, Ricardo in New York.
[03:55:20.177 --> 03:55:21.759]  Oh boy, Hillary's minions.
[03:55:22.359 --> 03:55:23.160]  Are you there, Ricardo?
[03:55:23.180 --> 03:55:24.221]  Been waiting a long time.
[03:55:24.421 --> 03:55:24.961]  Go ahead.
[03:55:27.122 --> 03:55:28.383]  Hey, how are you today, Matt?
[03:55:28.403 --> 03:55:29.063]  Good to meet you.
[03:55:29.203 --> 03:55:51.818]  I'm from Syracuse, New York, and we've spent the last mayoral cycle—my wife, who won the Martin Luther King Unsung Hero Award for community activism in 2012-2013—we've been fighting nonstop battle against Hillary Clinton.
[03:55:53.957 --> 03:56:01.879]  Her mayoral candidate of choice was sent from San Diego, California to come here and enact a gun.
[03:56:04.900 --> 03:56:06.601]  I'm sorry, we're losing you, Ricardo.
[03:56:06.621 --> 03:56:07.481]  Are you on a bad cell?
[03:56:07.561 --> 03:56:14.643]  I think we're going to have to drop that call because we just don't have enough time, but we're all keeping a very close eye on New York.
[03:56:15.484 --> 03:56:16.384]  Thanks a lot.
[03:56:17.344 --> 03:56:21.085]  Alex in Los Angeles has a comment about assimilation of immigrants.
[03:56:21.145 --> 03:56:21.765]  Go ahead, Alex.
[03:56:21.805 --> 03:56:23.406]  We only have about a minute left.
[03:56:23.894 --> 03:56:24.575]  Yes, hi.
[03:56:26.116 --> 03:56:36.983]  You know, Alex helped me get introduced to the American culture growing up here as an immigrant from Armenia, a former Soviet conquered state.
[03:56:38.704 --> 03:56:40.525]  I didn't really like America.
[03:56:40.545 --> 03:56:42.987]  I thought Los Angeles was America.
[03:56:43.467 --> 03:56:47.149]  As an immigrant, I was told to be proud of my culture and all this stuff.
[03:56:47.650 --> 03:56:50.912]  And nothing in the world can make me un-Armenian, but
[03:56:52.069 --> 03:56:59.092]  Once I found out the beauty and the magnificence of the American revolutionary culture, I fell in love with it.
[03:57:00.313 --> 03:57:09.037]  And we have to remind immigrants to assimilate that it is better, you have more opportunity, you need to learn English.
[03:57:09.778 --> 03:57:16.441]  Not just learn, but I stopped speaking my native language for a year once I realized this, just to improve English.
[03:57:17.156 --> 03:57:21.460]  Yeah, it's a really good point, Alex, but we're right at the end of the time now.
[03:57:21.960 --> 03:57:31.828]  I wish that all of our immigrants had your spirit and your attitude, but I don't see it because I think that the Democrats just want them to come in as voting blocs.
[03:57:31.868 --> 03:57:34.790]  They don't care if they speak English or not, as long as they vote Democrat.
[03:57:35.371 --> 03:57:37.112]  Alright, that's it for this week.
[03:57:37.653 --> 03:57:42.817]  I don't have Patreon or anything like that, but I do have lots of books on Amazon.
[03:57:42.837 --> 03:57:43.958]  You can go there and
[03:57:44.756 --> 03:57:47.564]  See what I've been writing about for the last decade or so.
[03:57:48.346 --> 03:57:49.870]  And I'll see you next time.
[03:57:49.910 --> 03:57:52.497]  This is Bracken, off on InfoWars today.
[03:57:56.830 --> 03:58:00.112]  This is a solution for you and your family.
[03:58:00.412 --> 03:58:05.276]  This is something guaranteed, like oxygen and water, to sustain life.
[03:58:05.496 --> 03:58:07.197]  There are a bunch of bad halogens.
[03:58:07.317 --> 03:58:10.999]  There is one good halogen in the body, and it's pure atomic iodine.
[03:58:11.159 --> 03:58:13.161]  Most forms are bound, so you don't absorb them.
[03:58:13.241 --> 03:58:24.288]  But even microscopic amounts of the broken-down type are better than nothing, because your body recognizes it and takes it on, and tries to use it instead of bromine, chloride, fluorine, and the other bad ones.
[03:58:24.628 --> 03:58:27.249]  And there's a lot of things better than just wealth in this world.
[03:58:27.389 --> 03:58:28.470]  How about physical wealth?
[03:58:28.830 --> 03:58:30.871]  When I forget to take my iodine, I'm an idiot.
[03:58:31.391 --> 03:58:32.451]  We have X2.
[03:58:32.531 --> 03:58:37.793]  It's selling out because a company tried to put me over the barrel from the oil well company that drills to get it at 12,000 feet.
[03:58:38.253 --> 03:58:39.774]  We ended up finding an even better company.
[03:58:39.794 --> 03:58:45.956]  Their chemist said, you can put this in the way you have it, but you should add a little bit of vitamin C to stabilize it so it doesn't oxidize.
[03:58:46.076 --> 03:58:47.517]  And this other form of iodine
[03:58:47.637 --> 03:58:47.918]  That's X3.
[03:58:47.958 --> 03:58:49.259]  We have a limited supply of X2.
[03:58:49.279 --> 03:58:50.401]  It's our final run.
[03:58:50.461 --> 03:58:51.943]  But here are the headlines.
[03:58:51.963 --> 03:58:52.884]  That's Discovery Magazine.
